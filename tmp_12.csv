Because such characterization studies are feasible only for transiting systems that are both nearby and for which the planet-to-star radius ratio is relatively large, nearby small stars have been surveyed intensively. Doppler studies(4-6) and microlensing(7) have uncovered a population of planets with minimum masses of 1.9-10 times the Earth's mass (M(circle plus)), called super-Earths. The first constraint on the bulk composition of this novel class of planets was afforded by CoRoT-7b (refs 8, 9), but the distance and size of its star preclude atmospheric studies in the foreseeable future. Here we report observations of the transiting planet GJ 1214b, which has a mass of 6.55M(circle plus) and a radius 2.68 times Earth's radius (R(circle plus)), indicating that it is intermediate in stature between Earth and the ice giants of the Solar System. We find that the planetary mass and radius are consistent with a composition of primarily water enshrouded by a hydrogen-helium envelope that is only 0.05% of the mass of the planet. The atmosphere is probably escaping hydrodynamically, indicating that it has undergone significant evolution during its history. The star is small and only 13 parsecs away, so the planetary atmosphere is amenable to study with current observatories.","[Charbonneau, David; Berta, Zachory K.; Irwin, Jonathan; Burke, Christopher J.; Nutzman, Philip; Buchhave, Lars A.; Latham, David W.; Murray-Clay, Ruth A.; Holman, Matthew J.; Falco, Emilio E.] Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Buchhave, Lars A.] Univ Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Inst, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Lovis, Christophe; Bonfils, Xavier; Udry, Stephane; Queloz, Didier; Pepe, Francesco; Mayor, Michel] Univ Geneva, Observ Geneva, CH-1290 Sauverny, Switzerland; [Bonfils, Xavier; Delfosse, Xavier; Forveille, Thierry] Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, UMR 5571, Lab Astrophys Grenoble LAOG, F-38041 Grenoble 09, France; [Winn, Joshua N.] MIT, Dept Phys, Kavli Inst Astrophys & Space Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Charbonneau, D (reprint author), Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, 60 Garden St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",dcharbonneau@cfa.harvard.edu,,"Berta-Thompson, Zachory/0000-0002-3321-4924; Bonfils, Xavier/0000-0001-9003-8894; Buchhave, Lars A./0000-0003-1605-5666; Charbonneau, David/0000-0002-9003-484X","David and Lucile Packard Foundation Fellowship for Science and Engineering; US National Science Foundation [AST-0807690]; NASA [NCC2-1390, NNX09AB33G]; European Southern Observatory Director's Discretionary [283.C-5022]","We thank M.

Measurements of its size distribution constrain its accretion and collisional history, and the importance of material strength of Kuiper belt objects(1-4). Small, sub-kilometre-sized, Kuiper belt objects elude direct detection, but the signature of their occultations of background stars should be detectable(5-9). Observations at both optical(10) and X-ray(11) wavelengths claim to have detected such occultations, but their implied abundances are inconsistent with each other and far exceed theoretical expectations. Here we report an analysis of archival data that reveals an occultation by a body with an approximately 500-metre radius at a distance of 45 astronomical units. The probability of this event arising from random statistical fluctuations within our data set is about two per cent. Our survey yields a surface density of Kuiper belt objects with radii exceeding 250 metres of 2.1(-1.7)(+4.8) x 10(7) deg(-2), ruling out inferred surface densities from previous claimed detections by more than 5 sigma. The detection of only one event reveals a deficit of sub-kilometre-sized Kuiper belt objects compared to a population extrapolated from objects with radii exceeding 50 kilometres. This implies that sub-kilometre-sized objects are undergoing collisional erosion, just like debris disks observed around other stars.","[Schlichting, H. E.; Ofek, E.

An extension into the quantum domain is desirable as it could allow the production of non-trivial quantum states(1-4) and protection against decoherence(5,6). The difficulties associated with quantum, as opposed to classical, feedback arise from the quantum measurement process-in particular the quantum projection noise and the limited measurement rate-as well as from quantum fluctuations perturbing the evolution in a driven open system. Here we demonstrate real-time feedback control(7-12) of the motion of a single atom trapped in an optical cavity. Individual probe photons carrying information about the atomic position(13,14) activate a dipole laser that steers the atom on timescales 70 times shorter than the atom's oscillation period in the trap. Depending on the specific implementation, the trapping time is increased by a factor of more than four owing to feedback cooling, which can remove almost all the kinetic energy of the atom in a quarter of an oscillation period(12). Our results show that the detected photon flux reflects the atomic motion, and thus mark a step towards the exploration of the quantum trajectory(15,16) of a single atom at the standard quantum limit.","[Kubanek, A.; Koch, M.; Sames, C.; Ourjoumtsev, A.; Pinkse, P.

Given the nature of interactions(4-8) between electrons and photons, and considering their connections(9,10) through nanostructures, it should be possible to achieve imaging of evanescent electromagnetic fields with electron pulses when such fields are resolved in both space (nanometre and below) and time (femtosecond) (11-13). Here we report the development of photon-induced near-field electron microscopy (PINEM), and the associated phenomena. We show that the precise spatiotemporal overlap of femtosecond single-electron packets with intense optical pulses at a nanostructure (individual carbon nanotube or silver nanowire in this instance) results in the direct absorption of integer multiples of photon quanta (nh omega) by the relativistic electrons accelerated to 200 keV. By energy-filtering only those electrons resulting from this absorption, it is possible to image directly in space the near-field electric field distribution, obtain the temporal behaviour of the field on the femtosecond timescale, and map its spatial polarization dependence. We believe that the observation of the photon-induced near-field effect in ultrafast electron microscopy demonstrates the potential for many applications, including those of direct space-time imaging of localized fields at interfaces and visualization of phenomena related to photonics, plasmonics and nanostructures.","[Barwick, Brett; Flannigan, David J.; Zewail, Ahmed H.] CALTECH, Arthur Amos Noyes Lab Chem Phys, Phys Biol Ctr Ultrafast Sci & Technol, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Zewail, AH (reprint author), CALTECH, Arthur Amos Noyes Lab Chem Phys, Phys Biol Ctr Ultrafast Sci & Technol, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",zewail@caltech.edu,"Flannigan, David/E-4449-2014","Flannigan, David/0000-0002-1829-1868; gaber, sarah/0000-0002-5995-7291",National Science Foundation; Air Force Office of Scientific Research in the Gordon; Betty Moore Center for Physical Biology at the California Institute of Technology,This work was supported by the National Science Foundation and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research in the Gordon and Betty Moore Center for Physical Biology at the California Institute of Technology.

Explanations for fault weakness include the presence of weak minerals(4), high fluid pressures within the fault core(8,9) and dynamic processes such as normal stress reduction(10), acoustic fluidization(11) or extreme weakening at high slip velocity(12-14). Dynamic weakening mechanisms can explain some observations; however, creep and aseismic slip are thought to occur on weak faults, and quasi-static weakening mechanisms are required to initiate frictional slip on mis-oriented faults, at high angles to the tectonic stress field. Moreover, the maintenance of high fluid pressures requires specialized conditions(15) and weak mineral phases are not present in sufficient abundance to satisfy weak fault models(16), so weak faults remain largely unexplained. Here we provide laboratory evidence for a brittle, frictional weakening mechanism based on common fault zone fabrics. We report on the frictional strength of intact fault rocks sheared in their in situ geometry. Samples with well-developed foliation are extremely weak compared to their powdered equivalents. Micro- and nanostructural studies show that frictional sliding occurs along very fine-grained foliations composed of phyllosilicates ( talc and smectite). When the same rocks are powdered, frictional strength is high, consistent with cataclastic processes. Our data show that fault weakness can occur in cases where weak mineral phases constitute only a small percentage of the total fault rock and that low friction results from slip on a network of weak phyllosilicate-rich surfaces that define the rock fabric. The widespread documentation of foliated fault rocks along mature faults in different tectonic settings and from many different protoliths(4,17- 19) suggests that this mechanism could be a viable explanation for fault weakening in the brittle crust.","[Collettini, Cristiano] Univ Perugia, Dipartimento Sci Terra, I-06100 Perugia, Italy; [Niemeijer, Andre; Marone, Chris] Penn State Univ, Dept Geosci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Niemeijer, Andre; Marone, Chris] Penn State Univ, Energy Inst, Ctr Geomech Geofluids & Geohazards, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Viti, Cecilia] Univ Siena, Dipartimento Sci Terra, I-53100 Siena, Italy","Collettini, C (reprint author), Univ Perugia, Dipartimento Sci Terra, I-06100 Perugia, Italy.",colle@unipg.it,,"collettini, cristiano/0000-0002-4828-2516; Niemeijer, Andre/0000-0003-3983-9308","NSF [OCE-0196462, EAR-0510182, INGV-DPC S5]; ERC [205175]","We thank I.

However, the possibility of universal patterns ranging across wars in the size distribution or timing of within-conflict events has barely been explored. Here we show that the sizes and timing of violent events within different insurgent conflicts exhibit remarkable similarities. We propose a unified model of human insurgency that reproduces these commonalities, and explains conflict-specific variations quantitatively in terms of underlying rules of engagement. Our model treats each insurgent population as an ecology of dynamically evolving, self-organized groups following common decision-making processes. Our model is consistent with several recent hypotheses about modern insurgency(18-20), is robust to many generalizations(21), and establishes a quantitative connection between human insurgency, global terrorism(10) and ecology(13-17,22,23). Its similarity to financial market models(24-26) provides a surprising link between violent and non-violent forms of human behaviour.","[Gourley, Sean; Johnson, Neil F.] Univ Miami, Dept Phys, Complex Syst Grp, Miami, FL 33126 USA; [Camilo Bohorquez, Juan] Univ Los Andes, Dept Ind Engn, Bogota, Colombia; [Camilo Bohorquez, Juan] Univ Los Andes, CEIBA Complex Syst Res Ctr, Bogota, Colombia; [Dixon, Alexander R.] Univ Cambridge, Cavendish Lab, Cambridge CB3 0HE, England; [Spagat, Michael] Univ London, Royal Holloway Coll, Dept Econ, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England","Johnson, NF (reprint author), Univ Miami, Dept Phys, Complex Syst Grp, Miami, FL 33126 USA.",njohnson@physics.miami.edu,"Bohorquez Pinzon, Juan Camilo/B-8008-2012","Dixon, Alexander/0000-0001-7628-4052",,,,30,85,88,1,33,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Dec,2009,462,7275,,,,,911,914,,10.1038/nature08631,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,533AX,WOS:000272795400041,20016600.0,No,,,11/20/17,neil f.,johnson,na,na,na,na,na

Earlier studies have shown that such learning induces an increase in the efficacy of synapses in the primary motor cortex, the persistence of which is associated with retention of the task(3-5). However, how motor learning affects neuronal circuitry at the level of individual synapses and how long-lasting memory is structurally encoded in the intact brain remain unknown. Here we show that synaptic connections in the living mouse brain rapidly respond to motor-skill learning and permanently rewire. Training in a forelimb reaching task leads to rapid (within an hour) formation of postsynaptic dendritic spines on the output pyramidal neurons in the contralateral motor cortex. Although selective elimination of spines that existed before training gradually returns the overall spine density back to the original level, the new spines induced during learning are preferentially stabilized during subsequent training and endure long after training stops. Furthermore, we show that different motor skills are encoded by different sets of synapses. Practice of novel, but not previously learned, tasks further promotes dendritic spine formation in adulthood. Our findings reveal that rapid, but long-lasting, synaptic reorganization is closely associated with motor learning. The data also suggest that stabilized neuronal connections are the foundation of durable motor memory.","[Xu, Tonghui; Yu, Xinzhu; Perlik, Andrew J.; Tobin, Willie F.; Zweig, Jonathan A.; Zuo, Yi] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Mol Cell & Dev Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Tennant, Kelly; Jones, Theresa] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Psychol, Inst Neurosci, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Zuo, Y (reprint author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Mol Cell & Dev Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",zuo@biology.ucsc.edu,"Jones, Theresa/F-1182-2010","Jones, Theresa/0000-0003-0906-6439",Ellison Medical Foundation; DANA Foundation; National Institute on Aging,"We thank D.

However, it is unknown how neural circuits undergo continuous synaptic changes during learning while maintaining lifelong memories. Here we show, by following postsynaptic dendritic spines over time in the mouse cortex(7,8), that learning and novel sensory experience lead to spine formation and elimination by a protracted process. The extent of spine remodelling correlates with behavioural improvement after learning, suggesting a crucial role of synaptic structural plasticity in memory formation. Importantly, a small fraction of new spines induced by novel experience, together with most spines formed early during development and surviving experience-dependent elimination, are preserved and provide a structural basis for memory retention throughout the entire life of an animal. These studies indicate that learning and daily sensory experience leave minute but permanent marks on cortical connections and suggest that lifelong memories are stored in largely stably connected synaptic networks.","[Yang, Guang; Pan, Feng; Gan, Wen-Biao] NYU, Sch Med,Helen & Martin Kimmel Ctr Biol & Med, Skirball Inst Biomol Med,Dept Physiol & Neurosci, Mol Neurobiol Program, New York, NY 10016 USA","Gan, WB (reprint author), NYU, Sch Med,Helen & Martin Kimmel Ctr Biol & Med, Skirball Inst Biomol Med,Dept Physiol & Neurosci, Mol Neurobiol Program, New York, NY 10016 USA.",gan@saturn.med.nyu.edu,,"Yang, Guang/0000-0002-5739-9126",National Institutes of Health [R01 NS047325]; Dart Foundation Fellowship; Ellison/AFAR Postdoctoral Fellowship,This work was supported by National Institutes of Health R01 NS047325 and a Dart Foundation Fellowship to W.-B.

Indeed, they drive cells out of quiescence, and the 'cancer cell cycle' in Rb1 null cells is E2f-dependent(1,2). Absence of activating E2fs in flies or mammalian fibroblasts causes cell cycle arrest(3,4), but this block is alleviated by removing repressive E2f or the tumour suppressor p53, respectively(5-7). Thus, whether activating E2fs are indispensable for normal division is an area of debate(1). Activating E2fs are also well known pro-apoptotic factors, providing a defence against oncogenesis(8), yet E2f1 can limit irradiation-induced apoptosis(9,10). In flies this occurs through repression of hid (also called Wrinkled; Smac/Diablo in mammals). However, in mammals the mechanism is unclear because Smac/Diablo is induced, not repressed, by E2f1(11), and in keratinocytes survival is promoted indirectly through induction of DNA repair targets(12). Thus, a direct pro-survival function for E2f1-3 and/or its relevance beyond irradiation has not been established. To address E2f1-3 function in normal cells in vivo we focused on the mouse retina, which is a relatively simple central nervous system component that can be manipulated genetically without compromising viability and has provided considerable insight into development and cancer(2,13). Here we show that unlike fibroblasts, E2f1-3 null retinal progenitor cells or activated Muller glia can divide. We attribute this effect to functional interchangeability with Mycn. However, loss of activating E2fs caused down-regulation of the p53 deacetylase Sirt1, p53 hyperacetylation and elevated apoptosis, establishing a novel E2f-Sirt1-p53 survival axis in vivo. Thus, activating E2fs are not universally required for normal mammalian cell division, but have an unexpected pro-survival role in development.","[Chen, Danian; Pacal, Marek; Bremner, Rod] Univ Toronto, Univ Hlth Network, Toronto Western Res Inst, Dept Ophthalmol & Visual Sci, Toronto, ON M5T 2S8, Canada; [Chen, Danian; Pacal, Marek; Bremner, Rod] Univ Toronto, Dept Lab Med & Pathobiol, Toronto, ON M5T 2S8, Canada; [Wenzel, Pamela; Leone, Gustavo] Ohio State Univ, Ctr Comprehens Canc, Dept Mol Virol Immunol & Med Genet, Human Canc Genet Program, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Wenzel, Pamela; Leone, Gustavo] Ohio State Univ, Ctr Comprehens Canc, Dept Mol Genet, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Knoepfler, Paul S.] Univ Calif Davis, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Knoepfler, Paul S.] Univ Calif Davis, Sch Med, Dept Human Anat, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Bremner, R (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Univ Hlth Network, Toronto Western Res Inst, Dept Ophthalmol & Visual Sci, Toronto, ON M5T 2S8, Canada.",rbremner@uhnres.utoronto.ca,"Wenzel, Pamela/A-2992-2010; Bremner, Rod/I-6490-2012","Bremner, Rod/0000-0001-9184-7212; Wenzel, Pamela L./0000-0002-4530-015X; Chen, Danian/0000-0002-6916-2978",Canadian Institutes for Health Research [MOP-74570],We thank L. van Parijs and R.

Using a panel of tissue-specific cre-transgenic mice and conditional E2f alleles we examined the effects of E2f1, E2f2 and E2f3 triple deficiency in murine embryonic stem cells, embryos and small intestines. We show that in normal dividing progenitor cells E2f1-3 function as transcriptional activators, but contrary to the current view, are dispensable for cell division and instead are necessary for cell survival. In differentiating cells E2f1-3 function in a complex with Rb as repressors to silence E2f targets and facilitate exit from the cell cycle. The inactivation of Rb in differentiating cells resulted in a switch of E2f1-3 from repressors to activators, leading to the superactivation of E2f responsive targets and ectopic cell divisions. Loss of E2f1-3 completely suppressed these phenotypes caused by Rb deficiency. This work contextualizes the activator versus repressor functions of E2f1-3 in vivo, revealing distinct roles in dividing versus differentiating cells and in normal versus cancer-like cell cycles.","[Chong, Jean-Leon; Wenzel, Pamela L.; Nair, Vivek; Ferrey, Antoney; Hagan, John P.; Gomez, Yorman M.; Sharma, Nidhi; Chen, Hui-Zi; Ouseph, Madhu; Wang, Shu-Huei; Trikha, Prashant; Culp, Brian; Mezache, Louise; Leone, Gustavo] Ohio State Univ, Coll Med, Dept Mol Virol Immunol & Med Genet, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Chong, Jean-Leon; Wenzel, Pamela L.; Nair, Vivek; Ferrey, Antoney; Gomez, Yorman M.; Sharma, Nidhi; Chen, Hui-Zi; Ouseph, Madhu; Wang, Shu-Huei; Trikha, Prashant; Culp, Brian; Mezache, Louise; Leone, Gustavo] Ohio State Univ, Coll Biol Sci, Dept Mol Genet, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Chong, Jean-Leon; Wenzel, Pamela L.; Nair, Vivek; Ferrey, Antoney; Hagan, John P.; Gomez, Yorman M.; Sharma, Nidhi; Chen, Hui-Zi; Ouseph, Madhu; Wang, Shu-Huei; Trikha, Prashant; Culp, Brian; Mezache, Louise; Leone, Gustavo] Ohio State Univ, Ctr Comprehens Canc, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Saenz-Robles, M.

Following DSB formation, cells activate the DNA-damage response (DDR) protein kinases ATM, ATR and DNA-PK (also known as PRKDC). These then trigger histone H2AX (also known as H2AFX) phosphorylation and the accumulation of proteins such as MDC1, 53BP1 (also known as TP53BP1), BRCA1, CtIP (also known as RBBP8), RNF8 and RNF168/RIDDLIN into ionizing radiation-induced foci (IRIF) that amplify DSB signalling and promote DSB repair(1,2). Attachment of small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) to target proteins controls diverse cellular functions(3-6). Here, we show that SUMO1, SUMO2 and SUMO3 accumulate at DSB sites in mammalian cells, with SUMO1 and SUMO2/3 accrual requiring the E3 ligase enzymes PIAS4 and PIAS1. We also establish that PIAS1 and PIAS4 are recruited to damage sites via mechanisms requiring their SAP domains, and are needed for the productive association of 53BP1, BRCA1 and RNF168 with such regions. Furthermore, we show that PIAS1 and PIAS4 promote DSB repair and confer ionizing radiation resistance. Finally, we establish that PIAS1 and PIAS4 are required for effective ubiquitin-adduct formation mediated by RNF8, RNF168 and BRCA1 at sites of DNA damage(7-11). These findings thus identify PIAS1 and PIAS4 as components of the DDR and reveal how protein recruitment to DSB sites is controlled by coordinated SUMOylation and ubiquitylation.","[Galanty, Yaron; Belotserkovskaya, Rimma; Coates, Julia; Polo, Sophie; Miller, Kyle M.; Jackson, Stephen P.] Univ Cambridge, Wellcome Trust & Canc Res UK Gurdon Inst, Cambridge CB2 1QN, England; [Galanty, Yaron; Belotserkovskaya, Rimma; Coates, Julia; Polo, Sophie; Miller, Kyle M.; Jackson, Stephen P.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Biochem, Cambridge CB2 1QN, England","Jackson, SP (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Wellcome Trust & Canc Res UK Gurdon Inst, Tennis Court Rd, Cambridge CB2 1QN, England.",s.jackson@gurdon.cam.ac.uk,"Dry, Kate/I-2328-2014","Polo, Sophie/0000-0003-4821-9354; Miller, Kyle/0000-0002-4544-0013; Jackson, Stephen Philip/0000-0001-9317-7937","Cancer Research UK; European Union [LSHG-CT-2005-512113, HEALTH-F2-2007-201630]","We thank S.

Considering that the lagging-strand polymerase has to recycle after the completion of every Okazaki fragment through the slowsteps of primer synthesis and hand-off to the polymerase(3-5), it is not understood how the two strands are synthesized with the same net rate(6-9). Here we show, using the T7 replication proteins(10,11), that RNA primers are made 'on the fly' during ongoing DNA synthesis and that the leading-strand T7 replisome does not pause during primer synthesis, contrary to previous reports(12,13). Instead, the leading-strand polymerase remains limited by the speed of the helicase(14); it therefore synthesizes DNA more slowly than the lagging-strand polymerase. We show that the primase-helicase T7 gp4 maintains contact with the priming sequence during ongoing DNA synthesis; the nascent lagging-strand template therefore organizes into a priming loop that keeps the primer in physical proximity to the replication complex. Our findings provide three synergistic mechanisms of coordination: first, primers are made concomitantly with DNA synthesis; second, the priming loop ensures efficient primer use and hand-off to the polymerase; and third, the lagging-strand polymerase copies DNA faster, which allows it to keep up with leading-strand DNA synthesis overall.","[Syed, Salman; Ha, Taekjip] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Pandey, Manjula; Donmez, Ilker; Patel, Gayatri; Patel, Smita S.] Univ Med & Dent New Jersey, Robert Wood Johnson Med Sch, Dept Biochem, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; [Ha, Taekjip] Univ Illinois, Dept Phys, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Ha, Taekjip] Univ Illinois, Ctr Phys Living Cells, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Ha, T (reprint author), Howard Hughes Med Inst, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",tjha@illinois.edu; patelss@umdnj.edu,"Ha, Taekjip/B-9506-2009","Ha, Taekjip/0000-0003-2195-6258","NIH [GM55310, GM065367]; NSF [0822613, 0646550]","We thank C.

Here we show that cancer-associated IDH1 mutations result in a new ability of the enzyme to catalyse the NADPH-dependent reduction of alpha-ketoglutarate to R(2)-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG). Structural studies demonstrate that when arginine 132 is mutated to histidine, residues in the active site are shifted to produce structural changes consistent with reduced oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate and acquisition of the ability to convert alpha-ketoglutarate to 2HG. Excess accumulation of 2HG has been shown to lead to an elevated risk of malignant brain tumours in patients with inborn errors of 2HG metabolism. Similarly, in human malignant gliomas harbouring IDH1 mutations, we find markedly elevated levels of 2HG. These data demonstrate that the IDH1 mutations result in production of the onco-metabolite 2HG, and indicate that the excess 2HG which accumulates in vivo contributes to the formation and malignant progression of gliomas.","[Dang, Lenny; White, David W.; Gross, Stefan; Bittinger, Mark A.; Driggers, Edward M.; Fantin, Valeria R.; Jang, Hyun Gyung; Jin, Shengfang; Keenan, Marie C.; Marks, Kevin M.; Yen, Katharine E.; Heiden, Matthew G.

Despite their crucial role in neurobiology, the architecture and atomic structure of an intact ionotropic glutamate receptor are unknown. Here we report the crystal structure of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA)-sensitive, homotetrameric, rat GluA2 receptor at 3.6 angstrom resolution in complex with a competitive antagonist. The receptor harbours an overall axis of two-fold symmetry with the extracellular domains organized as pairs of local dimers and with the ion channel domain exhibiting four-fold symmetry. A symmetry mismatch between the extracellular and ion channel domains is mediated by two pairs of conformationally distinct subunits, A/C and B/D. Therefore, the stereochemical manner in which the A/C subunits are coupled to the ion channel gate is different from the B/D subunits. Guided by the GluA2 structure and site-directed cysteine mutagenesis, we suggest that GluN1 and GluN2A NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors have a similar architecture, with subunits arranged in a 1-2-1-2 pattern. We exploit the GluA2 structure to develop mechanisms of ion channel activation, desensitization and inhibition by non-competitive antagonists and pore blockers.","[Sobolevsky, Alexander I.; Rosconi, Michael P.; Gouaux, Eric] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Vollum Inst, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Gouaux, Eric] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Portland, OR 97239 USA","Gouaux, E (reprint author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Vollum Inst, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Pk Rd, Portland, OR 97239 USA.",gouauxe@ohsu.edu,,,NIH National Research Service Award; Howard Hughes Medical Institute,"We thank the personnel at beamlines 5.0.2, 8.2.1 and 8.2.2 of the Advanced Light Source and at beamline 24-ID-E of the Advanced Photon Source.

Free diffusion of urea across cell membranes is slow owing to its high polarity, and specialized urea transporters have evolved to achieve rapid and selective urea permeation. Here we present the 2.3 angstrom structure of a functional urea transporter from the bacterium Desulfovibrio vulgaris. The transporter is a homotrimer, and each subunit contains a continuous membrane-spanning pore formed by the two homologous halves of the protein. The pore contains a constricted selectivity filter that can accommodate several dehydrated urea molecules in single file. Backbone and side-chain oxygen atoms provide continuous coordination of urea as it progresses through the filter, and well-placed alpha-helix dipoles provide further compensation for dehydration energy. These results establish that the urea transporter operates by a channel-like mechanism and reveal the physical and chemical basis of urea selectivity.","[Levin, Elena J.; Zhou, Ming] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Physiol & Cellular Biophys, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Quick, Matthias] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Quick, Matthias] New York State Psychiat Inst & Hosp, Div Mol Therapeut, New York, NY 10032 USA","Zhou, M (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Physiol & Cellular Biophys, 630 W 168th St, New York, NY 10032 USA.",mz2140@columbia.edu,,,"US National Institutes of Health [HL086392, T32HL087745]; NIH [GM075026]; American Heart Association [0630148N]","We thank R.

Three structures of intrahelical oxoG-encounter complexes are compared with sequence-matched structures containing a normal G base in place of an oxoG lesion. Although the protein-DNA interfaces in the matched complexes differ by only two atoms-those that distinguish oxoG from G-their pronounced structural differences indicate that MutM can detect a lesion in DNA even at the earliest stages of encounter.

In an alternative model, jets are threaded with large-scale magnetic fields that originate at the central engine and that accelerate and collimate the material(4). To distinguish between the models the degree of polarization in early-time emission must be measured; however, previous claims of gamma-ray polarization have been controversial(5-8). Here we report that the early optical emission from GRB 090102 was polarized at 10 +/- 1 per cent, indicating the presence of large-scale fields originating in the expanding fireball. If the degree of polarization and its position angle were variable on timescales shorter than our 60-second exposure, then the peak polarization may have been larger than ten per cent.","[Steele, I.

The active regions of star-burst galaxies have exceptionally high rates of star formation, and their large size-more than 50 times the diameter of similar Galactic regions-uniquely enables reliable calorimetric measurements of their potentially high cosmic-ray density(2). The cosmic rays produced in the formation, life and death of massive stars in these regions are expected to produce diffuse gamma-ray emission through interactions with interstellar gas and radiation. M82, the prototype small starburst galaxy, is predicted(3,4) to be the brightest starburst galaxy in terms of gamma-ray emission. Here we report the detection of >700-GeV gamma-rays from M82. From these data we determine a cosmic-ray density of 250 eV cm(-3) in the starburst core, which is about 500 times the average Galactic density. This links cosmic-ray acceleration to star formation activity, and suggests that supernovae and massive-star winds are the dominant accelerators.","[Acciari, V.

Simple lattice packings of many shapes easily surpass this packing fraction(2,3). For regular tetrahedra, this conjecture was shown to be true only very recently; an ordered arrangement was obtained via geometric construction with phi = 0.7786 (ref. 4), which was subsequently compressed numerically to phi = 0.7820 (ref. 5), while compressing with different initial conditions led to phi = 0.8230 ( ref. 6). Here we show that tetrahedra pack even more densely, and in a completely unexpected way. Following a conceptually different approach, using thermodynamic computer simulations that allow the system to evolve naturally towards high-density states, we observe that a fluid of hard tetrahedra undergoes a first-order phase transition to a dodecagonal quasicrystal(7-10), which can be compressed to a packing fraction of phi = 0.8324. By compressing a crystalline approximant of the quasicrystal, the highest packing fraction we obtain is phi = 0.8503. If quasicrystal formation is suppressed, the system remains disordered, jams and compresses to phi = 0.7858. Jamming and crystallization are both preceded by an entropy-driven transition from a simple fluid of independent tetrahedra to a complex fluid characterized by tetrahedra arranged in densely packed local motifs of pentagonal dipyramids that form a percolating network at the transition. The quasicrystal that we report represents the first example of a quasicrystal formed from hard or non-spherical particles. Our results demonstrate that particle shape and entropy can produce highly complex, ordered structures.","[Haji-Akbari, Amir; Engel, Michael; Keys, Aaron S.; Glotzer, Sharon C.] Univ Michigan, Dept Chem Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Glotzer, Sharon C.] Univ Michigan, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Palffy-Muhoray, Peter] Kent State Univ, Inst Liquid Crystal, Kent, OH 44242 USA; [Zheng, Xiaoyu] Kent State Univ, Dept Math Sci, Kent, OH 44242 USA; [Petschek, Rolfe G.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Phys, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA","Glotzer, SC (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Dept Chem Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",sglotzer@umich.edu,"Haji-Akbari, Amir/G-7969-2011; Keys, Aaron/A-2572-2012; Engel, Michael/G-1778-2010","Engel, Michael/0000-0002-7031-3825",The Air Force Office of Scientific Research; The National Science Foundation; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft,"The Air Force Office of Scientific Research supported A.

The Atlantic waters found a way through the present Gibraltar Strait and rapidly refilled the Mediterranean 5.33 million years ago in an event known as the Zanclean flood(4). The nature, abruptness and evolution of this flood remain poorly constrained(4-6). Borehole and seismic data show incisions over 250 m deep on both sides of the Gibraltar Strait that have previously been attributed to fluvial erosion during the desiccation(4,7). Here we show the continuity of this 200-km-long channel across the strait and explain its morphology as the result of erosion by the flooding waters, adopting an incision model validated in mountain rivers. This model in turn allows us to estimate the duration of the flood. Although the available data are limited, our findings suggest that the feedback between water flow and incision in the early stages of flooding imply discharges of about 10(8) m(3) s(-1) (three orders of magnitude larger than the present Amazon River) and incision rates above 0.4 m per day. Although the flood started at low water discharges that may have lasted for up to several thousand years, our results suggest that 90 per cent of the water was transferred in a short period ranging from a few months to two years. This extremely abrupt flood may have involved peak rates of sea level rise in the Mediterranean of more than ten metres per day.","[Garcia-Castellanos, D.; Jimenez-Munt, I.; Fernandez, M.; Verges, J.; De Vicente, R.] CSIC, Inst Ciencies Terra Jaume Almera, Barcelona, Spain; [Estrada, F.] CSIC, Inst Ciencies Mar, Barcelona, Spain; [Gorini, C.] Univ Paris 06, F-75005 Paris, France; [Gorini, C.] CNRS, ISTEP, UMR 7193, F-75005 Paris, France","Garcia-Castellanos, D (reprint author), CSIC, Inst Ciencies Terra Jaume Almera, Sole & Sabaris S-N, Barcelona, Spain.",danielgc@ictja.csic.es,"Verges, Jaume/D-3070-2011; Fernandez, Manel/A-1628-2012; Garcia-Castellanos, Daniel/B-1203-2008; Jimenez-Munt, Ivone/B-7073-2009; Estrada, Ferran/G-8255-2015","Verges, Jaume/0000-0002-4467-5291; Fernandez, Manel/0000-0002-4487-2359; Garcia-Castellanos, Daniel/0000-0001-8454-8572; Jimenez-Munt, Ivone/0000-0003-4178-3585; ",Spanish Government [CGL2006-05493],"We thank P.

The unusually large positive Clapeyron slope found for the boundary between perovskite (Pv) and post-perovskite (pPv)(1-3) ( the 'pPv boundary') would destabilize high-temperature anomalies in the lowermost mantle(4), in disagreement with the seismic observations(5). Here we report the thickness of the pPv boundary in (Mg0.91Fe0.092+)SiO3 and (Mg0.9Fe0.13+)(Al0.1Si0.9)O-3 as determined in a laser-heated diamond-anvil cell under in situ high-pressure (up to 145 GPa), high-temperature ( up to 3,000 K) conditions. The measured Clapeyron slope is consistent with the D '' discontinuity(6). In both systems, however, the pPv boundary thickness increases to 400-600 +/- 100 km, which is substantially greater than the thickness of the D '' discontinuity (< 30 km)(7). Although the Fe2+ buffering effect of ferropericlase(8-10) could decrease the pPv boundary thickness, the boundary may remain thick in a pyrolitic composition because of the effects of Al and the rapid temperature increase in the D '' layer. The pPv boundary would be particularly thick in regions with an elevated Al content and/or a low Mg/Si ratio, reducing the effects of the large positive Clapeyron slope on the buoyancy of thermal anomalies and stabilizing compositional heterogeneities in the lowermost mantle. If the pPv transition is the source of the D '' discontinuity, regions with sharp discontinuities may require distinct compositions, such as a higher Mg/Si ratio or a lower Al content.","[Catalli, Krystle; Shim, Sang-Heon] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Prakapenka, Vitali] Univ Chicago, GeoSoilEnviroCARS, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Shim, SH (reprint author), MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",sangshim@mit.edu,,"Shim, Sang-Heon/0000-0001-5203-6038",US National Science Foundation (NSF) [EAR0738655]; US Department of Energy ( DOE) National Nuclear Security Administration Stewardship Science Graduate Fellowship,"This work is supported by the US National Science Foundation (NSF) grant EAR0738655 (S.-H.

Classic sexual selection theory notes that because sperm are cheaper to produce than eggs(2), and because males generally compete more intensely for reproductive opportunities and invest less in parental care than females(3), males can obtain greater fitness benefits from mating multiply(2,4). Therefore, sexual selection typically results in male-biased sex differences in secondary sexual characters(1,4). This generality has recently been questioned, because in cooperatively breeding vertebrates, the strength of selection on traits used in intra-sexual competition for access to mates (sexual selection(1,4)) or other resources linked to reproduction (social selection(5,6)) is similar in males and females(7,8). Because selection is acting with comparable intensity in both sexes in cooperatively breeding species, the degree of sexual dimorphism in traits used in intrasexual competition should be reduced in cooperative breeders(6). Here we use the socially diverse African starlings (Sturnidae) to demonstrate that the degree of sexual dimorphism in plumage and body size is reduced in cooperatively breeding species as a result of increased selection on females for traits that increase access to reproductive opportunities, other resources, or higher social status. In cooperative breeders such as these, where there is unequal sharing of reproduction (reproductive skew) among females, and where female dominance rank influences access to mates and other resources, intrasexual competition among females may be intense(7) and ultimately select for female trait elaboration(9). Selection is thereby acting with different intensities on males and females in cooperatively versus non-cooperatively breeding species, and female-female interactions in group-living vertebrates will have important consequences for the evolution of female morphological, physiological and behavioural traits.","[Rubenstein, Dustin R.] Columbia Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Environm Biol, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Rubenstein, Dustin R.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Museum Vertebrate Zool, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Rubenstein, Dustin R.; Lovette, Irby J.] Cornell Lab Ornithol, Fuller Evolutionary Biol Program, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA","Rubenstein, DR (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Environm Biol, 10th Floor Schermerhorn Extens,1200 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY 10027 USA.",dr2497@columbia.edu,"Rubenstein, Dustin/A-3451-2015","Rubenstein, Dustin/0000-0002-4999-3723","NSF [DEB-0515981]; Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science at the University of California, Berkeley","This research was supported by grants from NSF to I.

Several mechanisms for left-right asymmetry determination have been proposed for vertebrates(1-10) and invertebrates(1,2,4,9,11-14) but they are still not well characterized, particularly at the early developmental stage. The gastropods Lymnaea stagnalis and the closely related Lymnaea peregra have both the sinistral (recessive) and the dextral (dominant) snails within a species and the chirality is hereditary, determined by a single locus that functions maternally(15-18). Intriguingly, the handedness-determining gene(s) and the mechanisms are not yet identified. Here we show that in L. stagnalis, the chiral blastomere arrangement at the eight-cell stage (but not the two-or four-cell stage) determines the left-right asymmetry throughout the developmental programme, and acts upstream of the Nodal signalling pathway. Thus, we could demonstrate that mechanical micromanipulation of the third cleavage chirality (from the four-to the eight-cell stage) leads to reversal of embryonic handedness. These manipulated embryos grew to 'dextralized' sinistral and 'sinistralized' dextral snails-that is, normal healthy fertile organisms with all the usual left-right asymmetries reversed to that encoded by the mothers' genetic information. Moreover, manipulation reversed the embryonic nodal expression patterns. Using backcrossed F-7 congenic animals, we could demonstrate a strong genetic linkage between the handedness-determining gene( s) and the chiral cytoskeletal dynamics at the third cleavage that promotes the dominant-type blastomere arrangement. These results establish the crucial importance of the maternally determined blastomere arrangement at the eight-cell stage in dictating zygotic signalling pathways in the organismal chiromorphogenesis. Similar chiral blastomere configuration mechanisms may also operate upstream of the Nodal pathway in left-right patterning of deuterostomes/vertebrates.","[Kuroda, Reiko] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Arts & Sci, Dept Life Sci, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1538902, Japan; [Kuroda, Reiko; Endo, Bunshiro; Abe, Masanori; Shimizu, Miho] JST, ERATO SORST, Kuroda Chiromorphol Team, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1530041, Japan; [Kuroda, Reiko] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biophys & Biochem, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan","Kuroda, R (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Arts & Sci, Dept Life Sci, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1538902, Japan.",ckuroda@mail.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Shimizu, Miho/Q-8522-2017","Shimizu, Miho/0000-0003-4070-8209",,,,27,79,81,1,49,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,10-Dec,2009,462,7274,,,,,790,U112,,10.1038/nature08597,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,529ZZ,WOS:000272559900039,19940849.0,No,,,11/20/17,miho,shimizu,female,0.98,63,na,na

The elemental stoichiometry of microoorganisms is fundamental for understanding the production dynamics and biogeochemical cycles of ecosystems because microbial biomass is the trophic base of detrital food webs(4-6). Here we show that heterotrophic microbial communities of diverse composition from terrestrial soils and freshwater sediments share a common functional stoichiometry in relation to organic nutrient acquisition. The activities of four enzymes that catalyse the hydrolysis of assimilable products from the principal environmental sources of C, N and P show similar scaling relationships over several orders of magnitude, with a mean ratio for C: N: P activities near 1:1:1 in all habitats. We suggest that these ecoenzymatic ratios reflect the equilibria between the elemental composition of microbial biomass and detrital organic matter and the efficiencies of microbial nutrient assimilation and growth. Because ecoenzymatic activities intersect the stoichiometric and metabolic theories of ecology(7-9), they provide a functional measure of the threshold at which control of community metabolism shifts from nutrient to energy flow.","[Sinsabaugh, Robert L.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Hill, Brian H.] US EPA, Natl Hlth & Environm Effects Lab, Duluth, MN 55804 USA; [Shah, Jennifer J.

We are investigating the link between non-coding RNA and chromatin regulation through analysis of FLC - a regulator of flowering time in Arabidopsis and a target of several chromatin pathways. Here we use an unbiased strategy to characterize non-coding transcripts of FLC and show that sense/antisense transcript levels correlate in a range of mutants and treatments, but change independently in cold-treated plants. Prolonged cold epigenetically silences FLC in a Polycomb-mediated process called vernalization(2). Our data indicate that upregulation of long non-coding antisense transcripts covering the entire FLC locus may be part of the cold-sensing mechanism. Induction of these antisense transcripts occurs earlier than, and is independent of, other vernalization markers(3) and coincides with a reduction in sense transcription. We show that addition of the FLC antisense promoter sequences to a reporter gene is sufficient to confer cold-induced silencing of the reporter. Our data indicate that cold-induced FLC antisense transcripts have an early role in the epigenetic silencing of FLC, acting to silence FLC transcription transiently. Recruitment of the Polycomb machinery then confers the epigenetic memory. Antisense transcription events originating from 3' ends of genes might be a general mechanism to regulate the corresponding sense transcription in a condition/stage-dependent manner.","[Swiezewski, Szymon; Liu, Fuquan; Magusin, Andreas; Dean, Caroline] John Innes Ctr Plant Sci Res, Norwich NR4 7UH, Norfolk, England","Dean, C (reprint author), John Innes Ctr Plant Sci Res, Norwich NR4 7UH, Norfolk, England.",caroline.dean@bbsrc.ac.uk,,"Dean, Caroline/0000-0002-6555-3525; Swiezewski, Szymon/0000-0002-2007-2779",BBSRC [BB/D010799/1]; NERC [NE/C507629]; EU SIROCCO [LSHG-CT-2006-037900],"We thank all members of the Dean laboratory for discussions, J.

The nature of elements that activate oncogenes within such translocations has been a long-standing question. Translocations within Igh involve DNA double-strand breaks initiated either by the RAG1/2 endonuclease during variable, diversity and joining gene segment (V(D)J) recombination, or by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID, also known as AICDA) during class switch recombination (CSR)(2-4). V(D)J recombination in progenitor B (pro-B) cells assembles Igh variable region exons upstream of mu constant region (C mu) exons, which are the first of several sets of CH exons ('C(H) genes') within a CH locus that span several hundred kilobases (kb)(5,6). In mature B cells, CSR deletes C mu and replaces it with a downstream C(H) gene(6). An intronic enhancer (iE mu) between the variable region exons and C mu promotes V(D)J recombination in developing B cells(7). Furthermore, the Igh 3' regulatory region (Igh3' RR) lies downstream of the C(H) locus and modulates CSR by long-range transcriptional enhancement of C(H) genes(8-10). Transgenic mice bearing iE mu or Igh3' RR sequences fused to c-myc are predisposed to B lymphomas, demonstrating that such elements can confer oncogenic c-myc expression(11-16). However, in many B-cell lymphomas, Igh-c-myc translocations delete iE mu and place c-myc up to 200 kb upstream of the Igh3' RR(1). Here we address the oncogenic role of the Igh3' RR by inactivating it in two distinct mouse models for B-cell lymphoma with Igh-c-myc translocations. We show that the Igh3' RR is dispensable for pro-B-cell lymphomas with V( D) J recombination-initiated translocations, but is required for peripheral B-cell lymphomas with CSR-associated translocations. As the Igh3' RR is not required for CSR-associated Igh breaks or Igh-c-myc translocations in peripheral B-cell lymphoma progenitors, we conclude that this regulatory region confers oncogenic activity by long-range and developmental stage-specific activation of translocated c-myc genes.","[Gostissa, Monica; Yan, Catherine T.; Bianco, Julia M.; Alt, Frederick W.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Gostissa, Monica; Yan, Catherine T.; Bianco, Julia M.; Alt, Frederick W.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Childrens Hosp, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Gostissa, Monica; Yan, Catherine T.; Bianco, Julia M.; Alt, Frederick W.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Immune Dis Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Gostissa, Monica; Yan, Catherine T.; Bianco, Julia M.; Alt, Frederick W.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Cogne, Michel; Pinaud, Eric] Univ Limoges, CNRS, Fac Med, UMR 6101, Limoges, France","Alt, FW (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",alt@enders.tch.harvard.edu,"PINAUD, Eric/O-8443-2016; cogne, michel/D-7370-2015","PINAUD, Eric/0000-0001-7405-9273; cogne, michel/0000-0002-8519-4427",National Institutes of Health (NIH) [CA92625]; Leukemia and Lymphoma Society of America (LLS) SCORE; NCI; de Villiers International Achievement Award; Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale; Howard Hughes Medical Institute,We thank L.

The paradox of misincorporating both a smaller (glycine) and a larger (serine) amino acid suggests a deep conflict for nature-designed AlaRS. Here we show the chemical basis for this conflict. Nine crystal structures, together with kinetic and mutational analysis, provided snapshots of adenylate formation for each amino acid. An inherent dilemma is posed by constraints of a structural design that pins down the alpha-amino group of the bound amino acid by using an acidic residue. This design, dating back more than 3 billion years, creates a serendipitous interaction with the serine OH that is difficult to avoid. Apparently because no better architecture for the recognition of alanine could be found, the serine misactivation problem was solved through free-standing AlaXps, which appeared contemporaneously with early AlaRSs. The results reveal unconventional problems and solutions arising from the historical design of the protein synthesis machinery.","[Guo, Min; Chong, Yeeting E.; Shapiro, Ryan; Beebe, Kirk; Yang, Xiang-Lei; Schimmel, Paul] Scripps Res Inst, Skaggs Inst Chem Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Guo, Min; Chong, Yeeting E.; Shapiro, Ryan; Beebe, Kirk; Yang, Xiang-Lei; Schimmel, Paul] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Schimmel, P (reprint author), Scripps Res Inst, Skaggs Inst Chem Biol, BCC 379,10550 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",schimmel@scripps.edu,,,National Institutes of Health [GM 15539]; National Foundation for Cancer Research,"We thank R.J.

Here we demonstrate that reprogramming by these transcription factors is a continuous stochastic process where almost all mouse donor cells eventually give rise to iPS cells on continued growth and transcription factor expression. Additional inhibition of the p53/p21 pathway or overexpression of Lin28 increased the cell division rate and resulted in an accelerated kinetics of iPS cell formation that was directly proportional to the increase in cell proliferation. In contrast, Nanog overexpression accelerated reprogramming in a predominantly cell-division-rate-independent manner. Quantitative analyses define distinct cell-division-rate-dependent and -independent modes for accelerating the stochastic course of reprogramming, and suggest that the number of cell divisions is a key parameter driving epigenetic reprogramming to pluripotency.","[Hanna, Jacob; Saha, Krishanu; Lengner, Christopher J.; Creyghton, Menno P.; Jaenisch, Rudolf] MIT, Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Pando, Bernardo; van Zon, Jeroen; van Oudenaarden, Alexander] MIT, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [van Zon, Jeroen; van Oudenaarden, Alexander; Jaenisch, Rudolf] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA","Jaenisch, R (reprint author), MIT, Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",Hanna@wi.mit.edu; Jaenisch@wi.mit.edu,"HANNA, JACOB/K-1339-2012; Saha, Krishanu/J-3980-2014","HANNA, JACOB/0000-0003-2042-9974; Lengner, Christopher/0000-0002-0574-5189; Saha, Krishanu/0000-0003-2837-0858","NIH [RO1-HDO45022, R37-CA084198, RO1-CA087869]; Helen Hay Whitney Foundation; Society in Science: The Brano- Weiss fellowship; Human Frontiers Science Program; National Cancer Institute [U54CA143874]","We would like to thank N.

Its action is mediated by the PYR/PYL/RCAR family of START proteins, but it remains unclear how these receptors bind ABA and, in turn, how hormone binding leads to inhibition of the downstream type 2C protein phosphatase (PP2C) effectors. Here we report crystal structures of apo and ABA-bound receptors as well as a ternary PYL2-ABA-PP2C complex. The apo receptors contain an open ligand-binding pocket flanked by a gate that closes in response to ABA by way of conformational changes in two highly conserved beta-loops that serve as a gate and latch. Moreover, ABA-induced closure of the gate creates a surface that enables the receptor to dock into and competitively inhibit the PP2C active site. A conserved tryptophan in the PP2C inserts directly between the gate and latch, which functions to further lock the receptor in a closed conformation. Together, our results identify a conserved gate-latch-lock mechanism underlying ABA signalling.","[Melcher, Karsten; Ng, Ley-Moy; Zhou, X.

Here we present the crystal structures of the ABA receptor PYL1 bound with (+)-ABA, and the complex formed by the further binding of (+)-ABA-bound PYL1 with the PP2C protein ABI1. PYL1 binds (+)-ABA using the START-protein-specific ligand-binding site, thereby forming a hydrophobic pocket on the surface of the closed lid. (+)-ABA-bound PYL1 tightly interacts with a PP2C domain of ABI1 by using the hydrophobic pocket to cover the active site of ABI1 like a plug.

Multiple distinct models involving chain assembly on E2 or substrate have been proposed. However, the speed and complexity of the reaction have precluded direct experimental tests to distinguish between potential pathways. Here we introduce new theoretical and experimental methodologies to address both limitations. A quantitative framework based on product distribution predicts that the really interesting new gene (RING) E3 enzymes SCF(Cdc4) and SCF(beta-TrCP) work with the E2 Cdc34 to build polyubiquitin chains on substrates by sequential transfers of single ubiquitins. Measurements with millisecond time resolution directly demonstrate that substrate polyubiquitylation proceeds sequentially.

Galactic 'microquasars', which are binary systems consisting of a neutron star or stellar-mass black hole accreting gas from a companion star, also produce relativistic jets, generally together with radio flares(2). Apart from an isolated event detected(3) in Cygnus X-1, there has hitherto been no systematic evidence for the acceleration of particles to gigaelectronvolt or higher energies in a microquasar, with the consequence that we are as yet unsure about the mechanism of jet energization. Here we report four gamma-ray flares with energies above 100 MeV from the microquasar Cygnus X-3 (an exceptional X-ray binary(4-6) that sporadically produces radio jets(7-9)). There is a clear pattern of temporal correlations between the c-ray flares and transitional spectral states of the radio-frequency and X-ray emission. Particle acceleration occurred a few days before radio-jet ejections for two of the four flares, meaning that the process of jet formation implies the production of very energetic particles. In Cygnus X-3, particle energies during the flares can be thousands of times higher than during quiescent states.","[Tavani, M.; Piano, G.; Evangelista, Y.; Trois, A.; Costa, E.; Vittorini, V.; Argan, A.; D'Ammando, F.; Del Monte, E.; De Paris, G.; Di Persio, G.; Donnarumma, I.; Feroci, M.; Lazzarotto, F.; Pacciani, L.; Rubini, A.; Scalise, E.; Soffitta, P.] INAF IASF Roma, I-00133 Rome, Italy; [Tavani, M.; Sabatini, S.; Striani, E.; Cocco, V.; D'Ammando, F.; Picozza, P.] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dipartimento Fis, I-00133 Rome, Italy; [Tavani, M.; Chen, A.

The core then gravitationally collapses to a neutron star or a black hole, leading to an explosion-an iron-core-collapse supernova(1,2). By contrast, extremely massive stars with M(initial) >= 140M(circle dot) (if such exist) develop oxygen cores with masses, M(core), that exceed 50M(circle dot), where high temperatures are reached at relatively low densities. Conversion of energetic, pressure-supporting photons into electron-positron pairs occurs before oxygen ignition and leads to a violent contraction which triggers a nuclear explosion(3-5) that unbinds the star in a pair-instability supernova. Transitional objects with 100M(circle dot) < M(initial) < 140M(circle dot) may end up as iron-core-collapse supernovae following violent mass ejections, perhaps as a result of brief episodes of pair instability, and may already have been identified(6-8). Here we report observations of supernova SN 2007bi, a luminous, slowly evolving object located within a dwarf galaxy. We estimate the exploding core mass to be M(core) approximate to 100M(circle dot), in which case theory unambiguously predicts a pair-instability supernova. We show that >3M(circle dot) of radioactive (56)Ni was synthesized during the explosion and that our observations are well fitted by models of pair-instability supernovae(9,10). This indicates that nearby dwarf galaxies probably host extremely massive stars, above the apparent Galactic stellar mass limit(11), which perhaps result from processes similar to those that created the first stars in the Universe.","[Gal-Yam, A.; Arcavi, I.] Weizmann Inst Sci, Fac Phys, Benoziyo Ctr Astrophys, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Mazzali, P.] Max Planck Inst Astrophys, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Mazzali, P.] Scuola Normale Super Pisa, I-56127 Pisa, Italy; [Ofek, E.

However, the charge neutrality of these systems presents an apparent limitation-a wide range of intriguing phenomena arise from the Lorentz force for charged particles in a magnetic field, such as the fractional quantum Hall effect in two-dimensional electron systems(4,5). The limitation can be circumvented by exploiting the equivalence of the Lorentz force and the Coriolis force to create synthetic magnetic fields in rotating neutral systems. This was demonstrated by the appearance of quantized vortices in pioneering experiments(6-9) on rotating quantum gases, a hallmark of superfluids or superconductors in a magnetic field. However, because of technical issues limiting the maximum rotation velocity, the metastable nature of the rotating state and the difficulty of applying stable rotating optical lattices, rotational approaches are not able to reach the large fields required for quantum Hall physics(10-12). Here we experimentally realize an optically synthesized magnetic field for ultracold neutral atoms, which is evident from the appearance of vortices in our Bose-Einstein condensate. Our approach uses a spatially dependent optical coupling between internal states of the atoms, yielding a Berry's phase(13) sufficient to create large synthetic magnetic fields, and is not subject to the limitations of rotating systems. With a suitable lattice configuration, it should be possible to reach the quantum Hall regime, potentially enabling studies of topological quantum computation.","[Lin, Y. -J.; Compton, R.

Applications include the manipulation of living cells by optical tweezers(1) and optical cooling in atomic physics(2). The miniaturization of optical systems ( to the micro and nanoscale) has resulted in very compliant systems with masses of the order of nanograms, rendering them susceptible to optical forces(3-6). Optical forces have been exploited to demonstrate chaotic quivering of microcavities(7), optical cooling of mechanical modes(8-11), actuation of a tapered-fibre waveguide and excitation of the mechanical modes of silicon nano-beams(12,13). Despite recent progress in this field(14-17), it is challenging to manipulate the optical response of photonic structures using optical forces; this is because of the large forces that are required to induce appreciable changes in the geometry of the structure. Here we implement a resonant structure whose optical response can be efficiently statically controlled using relatively weak attractive and repulsive optical forces. We demonstrate a static mechanical deformation of up to 20 nanometres in a silicon nitride structure, using three milliwatts of continuous optical power. Because of the sensitivity of the optical response to this deformation, such optically induced static displacement introduces resonance shifts spanning 80 times the intrinsic resonance linewidth.","[Wiederhecker, Gustavo S.; Chen, Long; Gondarenko, Alexander; Lipson, Michal] Cornell Univ, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Lipson, M (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",ml292@cornell.edu,"Wiederhecker, Gustavo/E-7456-2010","Wiederhecker, Gustavo/0000-0002-8216-6797",National Science Foundation [00446571]; Cornell University's Center for Nanoscale Systems; National Science Foundation; Cornell University and Industrial,"This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation under grant 00446571.

Documenting the spatial and temporal variability of past climates is therefore critical for understanding how such forcings are translated into regional climate variability. In contrast to the data-richmiddle and high latitudes, high-quality climate-proxy records from equatorial regions are relatively few(2-4), especially from regions experiencing the bimodal seasonal rainfall distribution associated with twice-annual passage of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Here we present a continuous and well-resolved climate-proxy record of hydrological variability during the past 25,000 years from equatorial East Africa. Our results, based on complementary evidence from seismic-reflection stratigraphy and organic biomarker molecules in the sediment record of Lake Challa near Mount Kilimanjaro, reveal that monsoon rainfall in this region varied at half-precessional (similar to 11,500-year) intervals in phase with orbitally controlled insolation forcing. The southeasterly and northeasterly monsoons that advect moisture from the western Indian Ocean were strengthened in alternation when the inter-hemispheric insolation gradient was at a maximum; dry conditions prevailed when neither monsoon was intensified and modest local March or September insolation weakened the rain season that followed. On sub-millennial timescales, the temporal pattern of hydrological change on the East African Equator bears clear high-northern-latitude signatures, but on the orbital timescale it mainly responded to low-latitude insolation forcing. Predominance of low-latitude climate processes in this monsoon region can be attributed to the low-latitude position of its continental regions of surface air flow convergence, and its relative isolation from the Atlantic Ocean, where prominent meridional overturning circulation more tightly couples low-latitude climate regimes to high-latitude boundary conditions.","[Verschuren, Dirk; Fagot, Maureen] Univ Ghent, Dept Biol, Limnol Unit, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Damste, Jaap S.

Recently, the effect of stress on the slope (the b value) of the earthquake frequency-magnitude distribution was determined(3) by investigations of the faulting-style dependence of the b value. In a similar manner, we study here aftershock sequences according to the faulting style of their main shocks. We show that the time delay before the onset of the power-law aftershock decay rate ( the c value) is on average shorter for thrust main shocks than for normal fault earthquakes, taking intermediate values for strike-slip events. These similar dependences on the faulting style indicate that both of the fundamental power laws are governed by the state of stress. Focal mechanisms are known for only 2 per cent of aftershocks. Therefore, c and b values are independent estimates and can be used as new tools to infer the stress field, which remains difficult to measure directly.","[Narteau, Clement; Byrdina, Svetlana; Shebalin, Peter] Univ P7, UMR 7154, CNRS, Inst Phys Globe, F-75252 Paris 05, France; [Byrdina, Svetlana] Univ Savoie, IRD, CNRS, Lab Geophys Interne & Tectonophys,UMR 5559, F-73376 Le Bourget Du Lac, France; [Shebalin, Peter] Int Inst Earthquake Predict Theory & Math Geophys, Moscow 117997, Russia; [Schorlemmer, Danijel] Univ So Calif, Dept Earth Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA","Narteau, C (reprint author), Univ P7, UMR 7154, CNRS, Inst Phys Globe, 4 Pl Jussieu, F-75252 Paris 05, France.",narteau@ipgp.jussieu.fr,"Narteau, Clement/C-6912-2011; Shebalin, Peter/G-6695-2011","Narteau, Clement/0000-0002-9556-9544; Shebalin, Peter/0000-0002-3361-3773",,,,29,56,57,2,21,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Dec,2009,462,7273,,,,,642,U113,,10.1038/nature08553,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,526HH,WOS:000272277900039,19956258.0,No,,,11/20/17,danijel,schorlemmer,male,1,73,na,na

These neuropeptides are inhibited in response to feeding-related signals and are released during fasting. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate and integrate these signals remain poorly understood. Here we show that the forkhead box transcription factor Foxa2,a downstream target of insulin signalling(4-6), regulates the expression of orexin and MCH. During fasting, Foxa2 binds to MCH and orexin promoters and stimulates their expression. In fed and in hyperinsulinemic obese mice, insulin signalling leads to nuclear exclusion of Foxa2 and reduced expression of MCH and orexin. Constitutive activation of Foxa2 in the brain (Nes-Cre/1; Foxa2T156A(flox/flox) genotype) results in increased neuronal MCH and orexin expression and increased food consumption, metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Spontaneous physical activity of these animals in the fed state is significantly increased and is similar to that in fasted mice. Conditional activation of Foxa2 through the T156A mutation expression in the brain of obese mice also resulted in improved glucose homeostasis, decreased fat and increased lean body mass. Our results demonstrate that Foxa2 can act as a metabolic sensor in neurons of the lateral hypothalamic area to integrate metabolic signals, adaptive behaviour and physiological responses.","[Silva, Jose P.; Howell, Jessica; Stoffel, Markus] Rockefeller Univ, Lab Metab Dis, New York, NY 10021 USA; [von Meyenn, Ferdinand; Howell, Jessica; Wolfrum, Christian; Stoffel, Markus] ETH, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Mol Syst Biol, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Thorens, Bernard] Univ Lausanne, Ctr Integrat Genom, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","Stoffel, M (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Lab Metab Dis, 1230 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA.",stoffel@imsb.biol.ethz.ch,"von Meyenn, Ferdinand/O-4517-2017","von Meyenn, Ferdinand/0000-0001-9920-3075",SystemsX; Swiss National Science Foundation,This study was supported by grants from SystemsX and the Swiss National Science Foundation (LiverX grant).

Dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons transmit sensory information to the spinal cord using the excitatory transmitter glutamate(1), a process that depends on glutamate transport into synaptic vesicles for regulated exocytotic release. Here we report that a small subset of cells in the DRG expresses the low abundance vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT3 (also known as SLC17A8). In the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, these afferents project to lamina I and the innermost layer of lamina II, which has previously been implicated in persistent pain caused by injury(2). Because the different VGLUT isoforms generally have a non-redundant pattern of expression(3), we used Vglut3 knockout mice to assess the role of VGLUT3(+) primary afferents in the behavioural response to somatosensory input. The loss of VGLUT3 specifically impairs mechanical pain sensation, and in particular the mechanical hypersensitivity to normally innocuous stimuli that accompanies inflammation, nerve injury and trauma. Direct recording from VGLUT3(+) neurons in the DRG further identifies them as a poorly understood population of unmyelinated, low threshold mechanoreceptors (C-LTMRs)(4,5). The analysis of Vglut3(-/-) mice now indicates a critical role for C-LTMRs in the mechanical hypersensitivity caused by injury.","[Seal, Rebecca P.; Edwards, Robert H.] Univ Calif San Francisco, San Francisco Sch Med, Dept Physiol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Seal, Rebecca P.; Edwards, Robert H.] Univ Calif San Francisco, San Francisco Sch Med, Dept Neurol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Wang, Xidao; Basbaum, Allan I.] Univ Calif San Francisco, San Francisco Sch Med, Dept Anat, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Wang, Xidao; Basbaum, Allan I.] Univ Calif San Francisco, San Francisco Sch Med, Dept Physiol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Guan, Yun; Raja, Srinivasa N.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anesthesiol & Crit Care Med, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Woodbury, C.

Indeed, environmental DNA samples have been shown to encode many previously unknown classes of proteins(4) and RNAs(5). Bioinformatics searches(6-10) of genomic DNA from bacteria commonly identify new noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs)(10-12) such as riboswitches(13,14). In rare instances, RNAs that exhibit more extensive sequence and structural conservation across a wide range of bacteria are encountered(15,16). Given that large structured RNAs are known to carry out complex biochemical functions such as protein synthesis and RNA processing reactions, identifying more RNAs of great size and intricate structure is likely to reveal additional biochemical functions that can be achieved by RNA. We applied an updated computational pipeline(17) to discover ncRNAs that rival the known large ribozymes in size and structural complexity or that are among the most abundant RNAs in bacteria that encode them. These RNAs would have been difficult or impossible to detect without examining environmental DNA sequences, indicating that numerous RNAs with extraordinary size, structural complexity, or other exceptional characteristics remain to be discovered in unexplored sequence space.","[Weinberg, Zasha; Breaker, Ronald R.] Yale Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Weinberg, Zasha; Perreault, Jonathan; Meyer, Michelle M.; Breaker, Ronald R.] Yale Univ, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Breaker, Ronald R.] Yale Univ, Dept Mol Biophys & Biochem, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Breaker, RR (reprint author), Yale Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Box 208103, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",ronald.breaker@yale.edu,"; Breaker, Ronald/E-9679-2010","Breaker, Ronald/0000-0002-2165-536X; Weinberg, Zasha/0000-0002-6681-3624; Perreault, Jonathan/0000-0003-4726-6319",NIH [RR19895-02]; Canadian Institutes of Health Research and National Institutes of Health; Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator,"We thank N.

Several proteins have been reported to function as ABA receptors(8-13), and many more are known to be involved in ABA signalling(3,4,14). However, the identities of ABA receptors remain controversial and the mechanism of signalling from perception to downstream gene expression is unclear(15,16). Here we show that by combining the recently identified ABA receptor PYR1 with the type 2C protein phosphatase (PP2C) ABI1, the serine/threonine protein kinase SnRK2.6/OST1 and the transcription factor ABF2/AREB1, we can reconstitute ABA-triggered phosphorylation of the transcription factor in vitro. Introduction of these four components into plant protoplasts results in ABA-responsive gene expression. Protoplast and test-tube reconstitution assays were used to test the function of various members of the receptor, protein phosphatase and kinase families. Our results suggest that the default state of the SnRK2 kinases is an autophosphorylated, active state and that the SnRK2 kinases are kept inactive by the PP2Cs through physical interaction and dephosphorylation. We found that in the presence of ABA, the PYR/PYL (pyrabactin resistance 1/PYR1-like) receptor proteins can disrupt the interaction between the SnRK2s and PP2Cs, thus preventing the PP2C-mediated dephosphorylation of the SnRK2s and resulting in the activation of the SnRK2 kinases. Our results reveal new insights into ABA signalling mechanisms and define a minimal set of core components of a complete major ABA signalling pathway.","[Fujii, Hiroaki; Chinnusamy, Viswanathan; Park, Sang-Youl; Cutler, Sean R.; Zhu, Jian-Kang] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Fujii, Hiroaki; Chinnusamy, Viswanathan; Zhu, Jian-Kang] 4700 King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Ctr Plant Stress Genom & Technol, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia; [Rodrigues, Americo; Rubio, Silvia; Antoni, Regina; Rodriguez, Pedro L.] Univ Politecn Valencia, CSIC, Inst Biol Mol & Celular Plantas, ES-46022 Valencia, Spain; [Sheen, Jen] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Mol Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA","Zhu, JK (reprint author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",jian-kang.zhu@ucr.edu,"Chinnusamy, Viswanathan/B-9079-2009; Rodrigues, Americo/F-9573-2010; Cutler, Sean/D-6617-2011; Rodriguez, Pedro L./K-4605-2014; Zhu, Jian-Kang/F-7658-2011","Chinnusamy, Viswanathan/0000-0003-2174-9064; Rodrigues, Americo/0000-0002-5293-5583; Fujii, Hiroaki/0000-0002-0013-5891; Rodriguez, Pedro L./0000-0002-5886-9425; Zhu, Jian-Kang/0000-0001-5134-731X",National Institutes of Health; MICIIN; CSIC,We thank R.

Recently, a 14-member family of intracellular ABA receptors, named PYR/PYL/RCAR(1-3), has been identified. These proteins inhibit in an ABA-dependent manner the activity of a family of key negative regulators of the ABA signalling pathway: the group-A protein phosphatases type 2C (PP2Cs)(4-6). Here we present the crystal structure of Arabidopsis thaliana PYR1, which consists of a dimer in which one of the subunits is bound to ABA. In the ligand-bound subunit, the loops surrounding the entry to the binding cavity fold over the ABA molecule, enclosing it inside, whereas in the empty subunit they form a channel leaving an open access to the cavity, indicating that conformational changes in these loops have a critical role in the stabilization of the hormone-receptor complex. By providing structural details on the ABA-binding pocket, this work paves the way for the development of new small molecules able to activate the plant stress response.","[Dupeux, Florine; Round, Adam; Marquez, Jose Antonio] UJF, EMBL, CNRS, European Mol Biol Lab,Grenoble Outstn, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France; [Dupeux, Florine; Round, Adam; Marquez, Jose Antonio] UJF, EMBL, CNRS, Unit Virus Host Cell Interact, F-38042 Grenoble, France; [Santiago, Julia; Antoni, Regina; Luis Rodriguez, Pedro] Univ Politecn Valencia, CSIC, Inst Biol Mol & Celular Plantas, ES-46022 Valencia, Spain; [Park, Sang-Youl; Cutler, Sean R.] Univ Calif Riverside, Ctr Plant Cell Biol, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Jamin, Marc] Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, EMBL, Virus Host Cell Interact UVHCI UMI 3265, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France","Marquez, JA (reprint author), UJF, EMBL, CNRS, European Mol Biol Lab,Grenoble Outstn, 6 Rue Jules Horowitz,BP181, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France.",marquez@embl.fr,"Rodriguez, Pedro L./K-4605-2014; Marquez, Jose/C-5826-2015; Cutler, Sean/D-6617-2011","Rodriguez, Pedro L./0000-0002-5886-9425; Santiago, Julia/0000-0002-5765-6495; Round, Adam/0000-0002-0723-8228; ",Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia [BIO2008-00221]; Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas; European Community-Research Infrastructure Action PCUBE,We thank A.

X-ray crystallography can provide snapshots of conformational substates sampled during enzymatic reactions(1), while NMR relaxation methods reveal the rates of interconversion between substates and the corresponding relative populations(1,2). However, these current methods cannot simultaneously reveal the detailed atomic structures of the rare states and rationalize the finding that intrinsic motions in the free enzyme occur on a timescale similar to the catalytic turnover rate. Here we introduce dual strategies of ambient-temperature X-ray crystallographic data collection and automated electron-density sampling to structurally unravel interconverting substates of the human proline isomerase, cyclophilin A (CYPA, also known as PPIA). A conservative mutation outside the active site was designed to stabilize features of the previously hidden minor conformation. This mutation not only inverts the equilibrium between the substates, but also causes large, parallel reductions in the conformational interconversion rates and the catalytic rate. These studies introduce crystallographic approaches to define functional minor protein conformations and, in combination with NMR analysis of the enzyme dynamics in solution, show how collective motions directly contribute to the catalytic power of an enzyme.","[Fraser, James S.; Degnan, Sheena C.; Erion, Renske; Alber, Tom] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol QB3, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Clarkson, Michael W.; Kern, Dorothee] Brandeis Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biochem, Waltham, MA 02454 USA","Alber, T (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol QB3, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",dkern@brandeis.edu; tom@ucxray.berkeley.edu,,"Fraser, James/0000-0002-5080-2859",US NSF; Canadian NSERC; US National Institutes of Health; US Department of Energy Office of Basic Energy Sciences; Howard Hughes Medical Institute,"We thank S.

FocA forms a symmetric pentamer, with each protomer consisting of six transmembrane segments. Despite a lack of sequence homology, the overall structure of the FocA protomer closely resembles that of aquaporin and strongly argues that FocA is a channel, rather than a transporter.

This problem is particularly relevant in the case of the highly charged S1-S4 voltage-sensing domains responsible for nerve impulses, where interactions with the lipid bilayer are critical for the function of voltage-activated ion channels. Here we use neutron diffraction, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the structure and hydration of bilayer membranes containing S1-S4 voltage-sensing domains. Our results show that voltage sensors adopt transmembrane orientations and cause a modest reshaping of the surrounding lipid bilayer, and that water molecules intimately interact with the protein within the membrane. These structural findings indicate that voltage sensors have evolved to interact with the lipid membrane while keeping energetic and structural perturbations to a minimum, and that water penetrates the membrane, to hydrate charged residues and shape the transmembrane electric field.","[Mihailescu, Mihaela; Freites, J.

It contains several stellar populations having different heavy elemental abundances supplied by supernovae(5)-a process known as metal enrichment. Although M 22 appears to be similar to omega Cen(6), other peculiar globular clusters do not(7,8). Therefore omega Cen and M 22 are viewed as exceptional, and the presence of chemical inhomogeneities in other clusters is seen as 'pollution' from the intermediate-mass asymptotic-giant-branch stars expected in normal globular clusters(9). Here we report Ca abundances for seven globular clusters and compare them to omega Cen. Calcium and other heavy elements can only be supplied through numerous supernovae explosions of massive stars in these stellar systems(10), but the gravitational potentials of the present-day clusters cannot preserve most of the ejecta from such explosions(11). We conclude that these globular clusters, like omega Cen, are most probably the relics of more massive primeval dwarf galaxies that merged and disrupted to form the proto-Galaxy.","[Lee, Jae-Woo; Kang, Young-Woon; Lee, Jina] Sejong Univ, ARCSEC, Dept Astron & Space Sci, Seoul 143747, South Korea; [Lee, Young-Wook] Yonsei Univ, Ctr Space Astrophys, Seoul 120749, South Korea","Lee, JW (reprint author), Sejong Univ, ARCSEC, Dept Astron & Space Sci, Seoul 143747, South Korea.",jaewoolee@sejong.ac.kr; ywlee2@yonsei.ac.kr,,,National Research Foundation of Korea,"J.-W.L. thanks A.

Although recent results(1-3) suggest that their formation may have been more complex than previously thought, they still are the best approximation to a stellar population formed over a relatively short timescale (less than 1 Gyr) and with virtually no dispersion in the iron content. Indeed, only one cluster-like system (omega Centauri) in the Galactic halo is known to have multiple stellar populations with a significant spread in iron abundance and age(4,5). Similar findings in the Galactic bulge have been hampered by the obscuration arising from thick and varying layers of interstellar dust. Here we report that Terzan 5, a globular-cluster-like system in the Galactic bulge, has two stellar populations with different iron contents and ages. Terzan 5 could be the surviving remnant of one of the primordial building blocks that are thought to merge and form galaxy bulges.","[Ferraro, F.

The realization of superconductivity in heavily doped diamond(5), silicon(6), silicon carbide(7) and germanium(8) suggests that Cooper pairs eventually may be directly incorporated in semiconductor heterostructures(9), but these newly discovered superconductors are currently limited by their extremely large electronic disorder. Similarly, the electron mean free path in low-dimensional superconducting thin films is usually limited by interface scattering, in single-crystal or polycrystalline samples, or atomic-scale disorder, in amorphous materials, confining these examples to the extreme 'dirty limit'(10). Here we report the fabrication of a high-quality superconducting layer within a thin-film heterostructure based on SrTiO(3) ( the first known superconducting semiconductor(11)). By selectively doping a narrow region of SrTiO(3) with the electron-donor niobium, we form a superconductor that is two-dimensional, as probed by the anisotropy of the upper critical magnetic field. Unlike in previous examples, however, the electron mobility is high enough that the normal state resistance exhibits Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations that scale with the perpendicular field, indicating two-dimensional states. These results suggest that delta-doped SrTiO(3) provides a model system in which to explore the quantum transport and interplay(12) of both superconducting and normal electrons. They also demonstrate that high-quality complex oxide heterostructures can maintain electron coherence on the macroscopic scales probed by transport, as well as on the microscopic scales demonstrated previously(13).","[Kozuka, Y.; Kim, M.; Bell, C.; Kim, B.

Such spin-based technologies may have a profound impact on nanoelectronics, data storage, and logic and computer architectures. Recently it has become possible to induce and detect spin polarization in otherwise non-magnetic semiconductors ( gallium arsenide and silicon) using all-electrical structures(3-9), but so far only at temperatures below 150 K and in n- type materials, which limits further development. Here we demonstrate room-temperature electrical injection of spin polarization into n-type and p-type silicon from a ferromagnetic tunnel contact, spin manipulation using the Hanle effect and the electrical detection of the induced spin accumulation. A spin splitting as large as 2.9 meV is created in n-type silicon, corresponding to an electron spin polarization of 4.6%. The extracted spin lifetime is greater than 140 ps for conduction electrons in heavily doped n- type silicon at 300 K and greater than 270 ps for holes in heavily doped p-type silicon at the same temperature. The spin diffusion length is greater than 230 nm for electrons and 310 nm for holes in the corresponding materials. These results open the way to the implementation of spin functionality in complementary silicon devices and electronic circuits operating at ambient temperature, and to the exploration of their prospects and the fundamental rules that govern their behaviour.","[Dash, Saroj P.; Sharma, Sandeep; Patel, Ram S.; de Jong, Michel P.; Jansen, Ron] Univ Twente, MESA Inst Nanotechnol, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands","Jansen, R (reprint author), Univ Twente, MESA Inst Nanotechnol, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.",ron.jansen@el.utwente.nl,"Dash, Saroj/G-5225-2010; Patel, Ram Shanker/E-7377-2010","Patel, Ram Shanker/0000-0003-3532-3961; Sharma, Sandeep/0000-0001-5475-1297",NWO-VIDI; Netherlands Foundation,This work was financially supported by the NWO-VIDI programme and the Netherlands Foundation for Fundamental Research on Matter.,,26,392,397,7,135,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-Nov,2009,462,7272,,,,,491,494,,10.1038/nature08570,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,524LG,WOS:000272144200040,19940922.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,ron,jansen,male,0.98,1014,bZHbRU0AAAAJ,3188

At present these waters provide the main source of heat and salt for the surface branch of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (MOC)(2). There is evidence from past glacial-to-interglacial variations in foraminiferal assemblages(3) and model studies(4) that the amount of Agulhas leakage and its corresponding effect on the MOC has been subject to substantial change, potentially linked to latitudinal shifts in the Southern Hemisphere westerlies(5). A progressive poleward migration of the westerlies has been observed during the past two to three decades and linked to anthropogenic forcing(6), but because of the sparse observational records it has not been possible to determine whether there has been a concomitant response of Agulhas leakage. Here we present the results of a high-resolution ocean general circulation model(7,8) to show that the transport of Indian Ocean waters into the South Atlantic via the Agulhas leakage has increased during the past decades in response to the change in wind forcing. The increased leakage has contributed to the observed salinification(9) of South Atlantic thermocline waters. Both model and historic measurements off South America suggest that the additional Indian Ocean waters have begun to invade the North Atlantic, with potential implications for the future evolution of the MOC.","[Biastoch, A.; Boening, C.

Between transform faults, seafloor spreading and rifting is well established in several basins. Other than hotspot-dominated Iceland, the Gulf of California is the only part of the world's seafloor-spreading system that has been surrounded by enough seismometers to provide horizontal resolution of upper-mantle structure at a scale of 100 kilometres over a distance great enough to include several spreading segments. Such resolution is needed to address the long-standing debate about the relative importance of dynamic and passive upwelling in the shallow mantle beneath spreading centres. Here we use Rayleigh-wave tomography to image the shear velocity in the upper 200 kilometres or so of the mantle. Low shear velocities similar to those beneath the East Pacific Rise oceanic spreading centre underlie the entire length of the Gulf, but there are three concentrated locations of anomalously low velocities spaced about 250 kilometres apart. These anomalies are 40 to 90 kilometres beneath the surface, at which depths petrological studies indicate that extensive melting of passively upwelling mantle should begin(2,3). We interpret these seismic velocity anomalies as indicating that partial melting triggers dynamic upwelling driven by either the buoyancy of retained melt or by the reduced density of depleted mantle.","[Wang, Yun; Forsyth, Donald W.] Brown Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Savage, Brian] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Geosci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA","Wang, Y (reprint author), Brown Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",yun_wang@brown.edu,,,National Science Foundation,This research was supported by the MARGINS programme of the National Science Foundation.,,28,52,52,0,15,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,26-Nov,2009,462,7272,,,,,499,U192,,10.1038/nature08552,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,524LG,WOS:000272144200042,19940924.0,No,,,11/20/17,brian,savage,male,1,4600,na,na

This integration of information across auditory and visual streams has been observed in functional imaging studies(3,4), and has typically been attributed to the frequency and robustness with which perceivers jointly encounter event-specific information from these two modalities(5). Adding the tactile modality has long been considered a crucial next step in understanding multisensory integration. However, previous studies have found an influence of tactile input on speech perception only under limited circumstances, either where perceivers were aware of the task(6,7) or where they had received training to establish a cross-modal mapping(8-10). Here we show that perceivers integrate naturalistic tactile information during auditory speech perception without previous training. Drawing on the observation that some speech sounds produce tiny bursts of aspiration (such as English 'p')(11), we applied slight, inaudible air puffs on participants' skin at one of two locations: the right hand or the neck. Syllables heard simultaneously with cutaneous air puffs were more likely to be heard as aspirated ( for example, causing participants to mishear 'b' as 'p'). These results demonstrate that perceivers integrate event-relevant tactile information in auditory perception in much the same way as they do visual information.","[Gick, Bryan; Derrick, Donald] Univ British Columbia, Dept Linguist, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Gick, Bryan] Haskins Labs Inc, New Haven, CT 06511 USA","Gick, B (reprint author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Linguist, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",gick@interchange.ubc.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Council of Canada; National Institutes of Health [DC-02717],"This research was funded by a Discovery Grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Council of Canada to B.

RANKL and RANK are also expressed in the central nervous system(5,6). However, the functional relevance of RANKL/RANK in the brain was entirely unknown. Here we report that RANKL and RANK have an essential role in the brain. In both mice and rats, central RANKL injections trigger severe fever. Using tissue-specific Nestin-Cre and GFAP-Cre rank(floxed) deleter mice, the function of RANK in the fever response was genetically mapped to astrocytes. Importantly, Nestin-Cre and GFAP-Cre rank(floxed) deleter mice are resistant to lipopolysaccharide-induced fever as well as fever in response to the key inflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta and TNF alpha. Mechanistically, RANKL activates brain regions involved in thermoregulation and induces fever via the COX2-PGE(2)/EP3R pathway. Moreover, female Nestin-Cre and GFAP-Cre rank(floxed) mice exhibit increased basal body temperatures, suggesting that RANKL and RANK control thermoregulation during normal female physiology. We also show that two children with RANK mutations exhibit impaired fever during pneumonia. These data identify an entirely novel and unexpected function for the key osteoclast differentiation factors RANKL/RANK in female thermoregulation and the central fever response in inflammation.","[Hanada, Reiko; Leibbrandt, Andreas; Hanada, Toshikatsu; Trichereau, Jean; Paolino, Magdalena; Komnenovic, Vukoslav; Penninger, Josef M.] Austrian Acad Sci, Inst Mol Biotechnol, IMBA, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Kitaoka, Shiho; Furuyashiki, Tomoyuki; Narumiya, Shuh] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Fujihara, Hiroaki; Ueta, Yoichi] Univ Occupat & Environm Hlth, Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka 8078555, Japan; [Qadri, Fatimunnisa; Plehm, Ralph; Bader, Michael] Max Delbruck Ctr Mol Med, D-13125 Berlin, Germany; [Klaere, Steffen; von Haeseler, Arndt] Ctr Integrated Bioinformat, Max F Perutz Labs, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Mimata, Hiromitsu; Yoshimatsu, Hironobu] Oita Univ, Fac Med, Oita 8795593, Japan; [Takahashi, Naoyuki] Matsumoto Dent Univ, Inst Oral Sci, Nagano 3990781, Japan; [Kilic, Sara Sebnem] Uludag Univ, Fac Med, TR-16059 Bursa, Turkey; [Pifl, Christian] Med Univ Vienna, Ctr Brain Res, A-1090 Vienna, Austria","Penninger, JM (reprint author), Austrian Acad Sci, Inst Mol Biotechnol, IMBA, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",josef.penninger@imba.oeaw.ac.at,"Klaere, Steffen/B-4202-2013; Penninger, Josef/I-6860-2013; Furuyashiki, Tomoyuki/B-8760-2014","Klaere, Steffen/0000-0002-4570-6109; Penninger, Josef/0000-0002-8194-3777; Furuyashiki, Tomoyuki/0000-0001-8089-8399; Bader, Michael/0000-0003-4780-4164","UEHARA Foundation; Japan Foundation for Applied Enzymology; Austrian Ministry for Science and Research; Wiener Wissenschafts-, Forschungs- und Technologiefonds (WWTF); IMBA; Austrian Ministry of Sciences; Austrian Academy of Sciences; GEN-AU ( AustroMouse); EU Marie Curie Excellence; EU ERC","We thank C.

T-cell help is required for the generation of primary CTL responses as well as in promoting protective CD8(+) memory T-cell development(1). However, the role of CD4 help in the control of CTL responses at the effector stage is unknown. Here we show that fully helped effector CTLs are themselves not self-sufficient for entry into the infected tissue, but rely on the CD4(+) T cells to provide the necessary cue. CD4(+) T helper cells control the migration of CTL indirectly through the secretion of IFN-gamma and induction of local chemokine secretion in the infected tissue. Our results reveal a previously unappreciated role of CD4 help in mobilizing effector CTL to the peripheral sites of infection where they help to eliminate infected cells.","[Nakanishi, Yusuke; Iwasaki, Akiko] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Immunobiol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Lu, Bao; Gerard, Craig] Harvard Univ, Childrens Hosp, Div Pulm, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Iwasaki, A (reprint author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Immunobiol, 333 Cedar St, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",akiko.iwasaki@yale.edu,,,"NIH [AI054359, AI062428, AI39759, HL51366]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Burroughs Wellcome Investigators","We thank F.

NifV, which encodes homocitrate synthase (HCS)(3), has been identified from various diazotrophs but is not present in most rhizobial species that perform efficient nitrogen fixation only in symbiotic association with legumes. Here we show that the FEN1 gene of a model legume, Lotus japonicus, overcomes the lack of NifV in rhizobia for symbiotic nitrogen fixation. A Fix(-) (non-fixing) plant mutant, fen1, forms morphologically normal but ineffective nodules(4,5). The causal gene, FEN1, was shown to encode HCS by its ability to complement a HCS-defective mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Homocitrate was present abundantly in wild-type nodules but was absent from ineffective fen1 nodules. Inoculation with Mesorhizobium loti carrying FEN1 or Azotobacter vinelandii NifV rescued the defect in nitrogen-fixing activity of the fen1 nodules. Exogenous supply of homocitrate also recovered the nitrogen-fixing activity of the fen1 nodules through de novo nitrogenase synthesis in the rhizobial bacteroids. These results indicate that homocitrate derived from the host plant cells is essential for the efficient and continuing synthesis of the nitrogenase system in endosymbionts, and thus provide a molecular basis for the complementary and indispensable partnership between legumes and rhizobia in symbiotic nitrogen fixation.","[Hakoyama, Tsuneo; Niimi, Kaori; Watanabe, Hirokazu; Tabata, Ryohei; Matsubara, Junichi; Suganuma, Norio] Aichi Univ Educ, Dept Life Sci, Aichi 4488542, Japan; [Hakoyama, Tsuneo; Yano, Koji; Imaizumi-Anraku, Haruko; Kouchi, Hiroshi] Natl Inst Agrobiol Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058602, Japan; [Sato, Shusei; Nakamura, Yasukazu; Tabata, Satoshi] Kazusa DNA Res Inst, Chiba 2920812, Japan; [Li Jichun; Matsumoto, Tsuyoshi; Tatsumi, Kazuyuki] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Chem, Aichi 4648602, Japan; [Li Jichun; Matsumoto, Tsuyoshi; Tatsumi, Kazuyuki] Nagoya Univ, Res Ctr Mat Sci, Aichi 4648602, Japan; [Nomura, Mika; Tajima, Shigeyuki] Kagawa Univ, Fac Agr, Kita Ku, Kagawa 7610795, Japan; [Ishizaka, Masumi] Natl Inst Agroenvironm Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058604, Japan; [Kawaguchi, Masayoshi] Natl Inst Nat Sci, Natl Inst Basic Biol, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan","Suganuma, N (reprint author), Aichi Univ Educ, Dept Life Sci, Aichi 4488542, Japan.",nsuganum@auecc.aichi-edu.ac.jp,"Matsumoto, Tsuyoshi/E-8638-2013; Sato, Shusei/A-3616-2015","Sato, Shusei/0000-0002-0293-5366; Nakamura, Yasukazu/0000-0002-6782-5715","Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology","We thank E.

The excess absorption of light energy by photosynthetic pigments has led to the evolution of protective mechanisms that operate on the timescale of seconds to minutes and involve feedback-regulated de-excitation of chlorophyll molecules in photosystem II (qE). Despite the significant contribution of eukaryotic algae to global primary production(1), little is known about their qE mechanism, in contrast to that in flowering plants(2,3). Here we show that a qE-deficient mutant of the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, npq4, lacks two of the three genes encoding LHCSR (formerly called LI818). This protein is an ancient member of the light-harvesting complex superfamily, and orthologues are found throughout photosynthetic eukaryote taxa(4), except in red algae and vascular plants. The qE capacity of Chlamydomonas is dependent on environmental conditions and is inducible by growth under high light conditions. We show that the fitness of the npq4 mutant in a shifting light environment is reduced compared to wild-type cells, demonstrating that LHCSR is required for survival in a dynamic light environment. Thus, these data indicate that plants and algae use different proteins to dissipate harmful excess light energy and protect the photosynthetic apparatus from damage.","[Peers, Graham; Truong, Thuy B.; Niyogi, Krishna K.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Plant & Microbial Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Truong, Thuy B.; Niyogi, Krishna K.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Phys Biosci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Ostendorf, Elisabeth; Busch, Andreas; Hippler, Michael] Univ Munster, Inst Plant Biochem & Biotechnol, D-48143 Munster, Germany; [Elrad, Dafna; Grossman, Arthur R.] Carnegie Inst, Dept Plant Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Niyogi, KK (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Plant & Microbial Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",mhippler@uni-muenster.de; niyogi@berkeley.edu,,,"Chemical Sciences, Geosciences and Biosciences Division, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Office of Science, US Department of Energy; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; National Science Foundation","We thank M.

Purified aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases exhibit a fidelity of one error per 10,000 to 100,000 couplings(1,2). The accuracy of tRNA aminoacylation in vivo is uncertain, however, and might be considerably lower(3-6). Here we show that in mammalian cells, approximately 1% of methionine (Met) residues used in protein synthesis are aminoacylated to non-methionyl-tRNAs. Remarkably, Met-misacylation increases up to tenfold upon exposing cells to live or non-infectious viruses, toll-like receptor ligands or chemically induced oxidative stress. Met is misacylated to specific non-methionyl-tRNA families, and these Met-misacylated tRNAs are used in translation. Met-misacylation is blocked by an inhibitor of cellular oxidases, implicating reactive oxygen species (ROS) as the misacylation trigger. Among six amino acids tested, tRNA misacylation occurs exclusively with Met. As Met residues are known to protect proteins against ROS-mediated damage(7), we propose that Met-misacylation functions adaptively to increase Met incorporation into proteins to protect cells against oxidative stress. In demonstrating an unexpected conditional aspect of decoding mRNA, our findings illustrate the importance of considering alternative iterations of the genetic code.","[Netzer, Nir; David, Alexandre; Gibbs, James S.; Embry, Alan; Dolan, Brian; Das, Suman; Hickman, Heather D.; Berglund, Peter; Bennink, Jack R.; Yewdell, Jonathan W.] NIAID, Viral Dis Lab, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Goodenbour, Jeffrey M.] Univ Chicago, Dept Human Genet, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Dittmar, Kimberly A.; Pan, Tao] Univ Chicago, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Jones, Richard B.; Eves, Eva M.; Rosner, Marsha R.] Univ Chicago, Ben May Inst, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Schneider, Jeffrey R.; Boone, David] Univ Chicago, Dept Med, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Yewdell, JW (reprint author), NIAID, Viral Dis Lab, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",jyewdell@nih.gov; taopan@uchicago.edu,"yewdell, jyewdell@nih.gov/A-1702-2012; Das, Suman/C-8760-2009; David, Alexandre/B-2447-2013","David, Alexandre/0000-0003-3365-1339",Division of Intramural Research; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; National Institutes of Health,"The authors are grateful to D.

Here we present the first genome-wide, single-base-resolution maps of methylated cytosines in a mammalian genome, from both human embryonic stem cells and fetal fibroblasts, along with comparative analysis of messenger RNA and small RNA components of the transcriptome, several histone modifications, and sites of DNA-protein interaction for several key regulatory factors. Widespread differences were identified in the composition and patterning of cytosine methylation between the two genomes. Nearly one-quarter of all methylation identified in embryonic stem cells was in a non-CG context, suggesting that embryonic stem cells may use different methylation mechanisms to affect gene regulation. Methylation in non-CG contexts showed enrichment in gene bodies and depletion in protein binding sites and enhancers. Non-CG methylation disappeared upon induced differentiation of the embryonic stem cells, and was restored in induced pluripotent stem cells. We identified hundreds of differentially methylated regions proximal to genes involved in pluripotency and differentiation, and widespread reduced methylation levels in fibroblasts associated with lower transcriptional activity. These reference epigenomes provide a foundation for future studies exploring this key epigenetic modification in human disease and development.","[Lister, Ryan; Pelizzola, Mattia; Dowen, Robert H.; Nery, Joseph R.; Ecker, Joseph R.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Genom Anal Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Hawkins, R.

DNA is then opened with the help of the 'B-linker' that binds the Pol II rudder and clamp coiled-coil at the edge of the cleft. The DNA template strand slips into the cleft and is scanned for the transcription start site with the help of the 'B-reader' that approaches the active site. Synthesis of the RNA chain and rewinding of upstream DNA displace the B-reader and B-linker, respectively, to trigger B release and elongation complex formation.","[Kostrewa, Dirk; Armache, Karim-Jean; Seizl, Martin; Leike, Kristin; Cramer, Patrick] Univ Munich, Gene Ctr Munich, D-81377 Munich, Germany; [Kostrewa, Dirk; Armache, Karim-Jean; Seizl, Martin; Leike, Kristin; Cramer, Patrick] Univ Munich, Dept Chem & Biochem, CIPSM, D-81377 Munich, Germany; [Zeller, Mirijam E.; Thomm, Michael] Univ Regensburg, Inst Biochem Genet & Mikrobiol, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany","Cramer, P (reprint author), Univ Munich, Gene Ctr Munich, Feodor Lynen Str 25, D-81377 Munich, Germany.",cramer@lmb.uni-muenchen.de,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Sonderforschungsbereich [SFB646]; Transregio 5; Forschergruppe 'Regulation und Mechanismen der Ribosomen-Biogenese'; Nanosystems Initiative Munich (NIM); Ernst-Jung-Stiftung; Fonds der chemischen Industrie; Boehringer-Ingelheim-Fonds and Elitenetzwerk Bayern; DFG Forschergruppe 'Regulation und Mechanismen der Ribosomenbiogenese',"P.

While special relativity assumes that there is no fundamental length-scale associated with such invariance, there is a fundamental scale (the Planck scale, l(Planck) approximate to 1.62 x 10(-33) cm or E-Planck = M(Planck)c(2) approximate to 1.22 x 10(19) GeV), at which quantum effects are expected to strongly affect the nature of space-time. There is great interest in the (not yet validated) idea that Lorentz invariance might break near the Planck scale. A key test of such violation of Lorentz invariance is a possible variation of photon speed with energy(1-7). Even a tiny variation in photon speed, when accumulated over cosmological light-travel times, may be revealed by observing sharp features in gamma-ray burst (GRB) light-curves(2). Here we report the detection of emission up to similar to 31GeV from the distant and short GRB090510. We find no evidence for the violation of Lorentz invariance, and place a lower limit of 1.2E(Planck) on the scale of a linear energy dependence (or an inverse wavelength dependence), subject to reasonable assumptions about the emission (equivalently we have an upper limit of l(Planck)/1.2 on the length scale of the effect). Our results disfavour quantum-gravity theories(3,6,7) in which the quantum nature of space-time on a very small scale linearly alters the speed of light.","[Granot, J.] Univ Hertfordshire, Ctr Astrophys Res, Hatfield AL10 9AB, Herts, England; [Abdo, A.

This is all the more puzzling because Fermi pockets (small closed Fermi surface features) have been suggested by recent quantum oscillation measurements(9-14). The Fermi arcs cannot be understood in terms of existing theories, although there is a solution in the form of conventional Fermi surface pockets associated with competing order, but with a back side that is for detailed reasons invisible to photoemission probes(15). Here we report ARPES measurements of Bi2Sr2-xLaxCuO6+delta (La-Bi2201) that reveal Fermi pockets. The charge carriers in the pockets are holes, and the pockets show an unusual dependence on doping: they exist in underdoped but not overdoped samples. A surprise is that these Fermi pockets appear to coexist with the Fermi arcs. This coexistence has not been expected theoretically.","[Meng, Jianqiao; Liu, Guodong; Zhang, Wentao; Zhao, Lin; Liu, Haiyun; Jia, Xiaowen; Mu, Daixiang; Liu, Shanyu; Dong, Xiaoli; Zhang, Jun; Lu, Wei; Zhou, X.

Much of the research on graphene has been directed towards exploration of its novel electronic properties, but the structural aspects of this model two-dimensional system are also of great interest and importance. In particular, microscopic corrugations have been observed on all suspended(2) and supported(3-8) graphene sheets studied so far. This rippling has been invoked to explain the thermodynamic stability of free-standing graphene sheets(9). Many distinctive electronic(10-12) and chemical(13-15) properties of graphene have been attributed to the presence of ripples, which are also predicted to give rise to new physical phenomena(16-26) that would be absent in a planar two-dimensional material. Direct experimental study of such novel ripple physics has, however, been hindered by the lack of flat graphene layers. Here we demonstrate the fabrication of graphene monolayers that are flat down to the atomic level. These samples are produced by deposition on the atomically flat terraces of cleaved mica surfaces. The apparent height variation in the graphene layers observed by high-resolution atomic force microscopy (AFM) is less than 25 picometres, indicating the suppression of any existing intrinsic ripples in graphene. The availability of such ultraflat samples will permit rigorous testing of the impact of ripples on various physical and chemical properties of graphene.","[Lui, Chun Hung; Mak, Kin Fai; Heinz, Tony F.] Columbia Univ, Dept Phys, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Lui, Chun Hung; Mak, Kin Fai; Heinz, Tony F.] Columbia Univ, Dept Elect Engn, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Liu, Li; Flynn, George W.] Columbia Univ, Dept Chem, New York, NY 10027 USA","Heinz, TF (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Dept Phys, 538 W 120th St, New York, NY 10027 USA.",tony.heinz@columbia.edu,"Liu, Li/E-8959-2013; Heinz, Tony/K-7797-2015","Liu, Li/0000-0002-4852-1580; Heinz, Tony/0000-0003-1365-9464",DARPA; Nano Electronics Research Corporation (NERC) through the INDEX Center; National Science Foundation [CHE-07-01483]; US Department of Energy [DE-FG02-88-ER13937],"We thank E.

The relationship between the D/H ratio of mean annual precipitation and mean annual surface air temperature is said to be uniform +/- 10% over East Antarctica(3) and constant with time +/- 20% (refs 3-5). In the absence of strong independent temperature proxy evidence allowing us to calibrate individual ice cores, prior general circulation model (GCM) studies have supported the assumption of constant uniform conversion for climates cooler than that of the present day(3,5). Here we analyse the three available 340 kyr East Antarctic ice core records alongside input from GCM modelling. We show that for warmer interglacial periods the relationship between temperature and the isotopic signature varies among ice core sites, and that therefore the conversions must be nonlinear for at least some sites. Model results indicate that the isotopic composition of East Antarctic ice is less sensitive to temperature changes during warmer climates. We conclude that previous temperature estimates from interglacial climates are likely to be too low. The available evidence is consistent with a peak Antarctic interglacial temperature that was at least 6K higher than that of the present day -approximately double the widely quoted 3 +/- 1.5K (refs 5, 6).","[Sime, L.

The ocean plays a crucial role in mitigating the effects of this perturbation to the climate system, sequestering 20 to 35 per cent of anthropogenic CO2 emissions(2-4). Although much progress has been made in recent years in understanding and quantifying this sink, considerable uncertainties remain as to the distribution of anthropogenic CO2 in the ocean, its rate of uptake over the industrial era, and the relative roles of the ocean and terrestrial biosphere in anthropogenic CO2 sequestration. Here we address these questions by presenting an observationally based reconstruction of the spatially resolved, time-dependent history of anthropogenic carbon in the ocean over the industrial era. Our approach is based on the recognition that the transport of tracers in the ocean can be described by a Green's function, which we estimate from tracer data using a maximum entropy deconvolution technique. Our results indicate that ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO2 has increased sharply since the 1950s, with a small decline in the rate of increase in the last few decades. We estimate the inventory and uptake rate of anthropogenic CO2 in 2008 at 140 +/- 25 Pg C and 2.3 +/- 0.6 Pg C yr(-1), respectively. We find that the Southern Ocean is the primary conduit by which this CO2 enters the ocean (contributing over 40 per cent of the anthropogenic CO2 inventory in the ocean in 2008). Our results also suggest that the terrestrial biosphere was a source of CO2 until the 1940s, subsequently turning into a sink. Taken over the entire industrial period, and accounting for uncertainties, we estimate that the terrestrial biosphere has been anywhere from neutral to a net source of CO2, contributing up to half as muchCO(2) as has been taken up by the ocean over the same period.","[Khatiwala, S.] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Primeau, F.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Hall, T.] NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, New York, NY 10025 USA","Khatiwala, S (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA.",spk@ldeo.columbia.edu,"Primeau, Francois /A-7310-2011","Primeau, Francois /0000-0001-7452-9415","US NSF [OCE 06-23366, OCE 07-26871]",This work was supported by US NSF grants OCE 06-23366 (to S.

For many species, the primary obstacle to the evolution of outcrossing is the cost of production of males(1), individuals that do not directly contribute offspring and thus diminish the long-term reproductive output of a lineage. Self-fertilizing ('selfing') organisms do not incur the cost of males and therefore should possess at least a twofold numerical advantage over most outcrossing organisms(2). Two competing explanations for the widespread prevalence of outcrossing in nature despite this inherent disadvantage are the avoidance of inbreeding depression generated by selfing(3-5) and the ability of outcrossing populations to adapt more rapidly to environmental change(1,6,7). Here we show that outcrossing is favoured in populations of Caenorhabditis elegans subject to experimental evolution both under conditions of increased mutation rate and during adaptation to a novel environment. In general, fitness increased with increasing rates of outcrossing. Thus, each of the standard explanations for the maintenance of outcrossing are correct, and it is likely that outcrossing is the predominant mode of reproduction inmost species because it is favoured under ecological conditions that are ubiquitous in natural environments.","[Morran, Levi T.; Parmenter, Michelle D.; Phillips, Patrick C.] 5289 Univ Oregon, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Eugene, OR 97403 USA","Phillips, PC (reprint author), 5289 Univ Oregon, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",pphil@uoregon.edu,,"Phillips, Patrick/0000-0001-7271-342X","NSF [DEB-0236180, DEB-0710386, DEB-0641066]; NIH","Acknowledgements We thank S.

This 'binding' mechanism requires that spatially distributed cells fire together with millisecond range precision(7,8); however, it is not clear how such coordinated timing is achieved given that the frequency of gamma oscillations varies substantially across space and time, from similar to 25 to almost 150 Hz(1,9-13). Here we show that gamma oscillations in the CA1 area of the hippocampus split into distinct fast and slow frequency components that differentially couple CA1 to inputs from the medial entorhinal cortex, an area that provides information about the animal's current position(14-17), and CA3, a hippocampal subfield essential for storage of such information(14,18,19). Fast gamma oscillations in CA1 were synchronized with fast gamma in medial entorhinal cortex, and slow gamma oscillations in CA1 were coherent with slow gamma in CA3. Significant proportions of cells in medial entorhinal cortex and CA3 were phase-locked to fast and slow CA1 gamma waves, respectively. The two types of gamma occurred at different phases of the CA1 theta rhythm and mostly on different theta cycles. These results point to routeing of information as a possible function of gamma frequency variations in the brain and provide a mechanism for temporal segregation of potentially interfering information from different sources.","[Colgin, Laura Lee; Denninger, Tobias; Fyhn, Marianne; Hafting, Torkel; Bonnevie, Tora; Moser, May-Britt; Moser, Edvard I.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Kavli Inst Syst Neurosci, NO-7489 Trondheim, Norway; [Colgin, Laura Lee; Denninger, Tobias; Fyhn, Marianne; Hafting, Torkel; Bonnevie, Tora; Moser, May-Britt; Moser, Edvard I.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Ctr Biol Memory, MTFS, NO-7489 Trondheim, Norway; [Jensen, Ole] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Donders Inst Brain Cognit & Behav, NL-6500 HB Nijmegen, Netherlands","Colgin, LL (reprint author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Kavli Inst Syst Neurosci, Olav Kyrres Gate 9, NO-7489 Trondheim, Norway.",laura.colgin@ntnu.no; edvard.moser@ntnu.no,"Jensen, Ole/D-2120-2010","Jensen, Ole/0000-0001-8193-8348; Hafting, Torkel/0000-0002-0928-3487",Kavli Foundation; Norwegian Research Council,"We thank A.

It is unclear how these different molecular regulatory mechanisms interact to regulate changes in stem cell fate. Here we present a dynamic systems-level study of cell fate change in murine ESCs following a well-defined perturbation. Global changes in histone acetylation, chromatin-bound RNA polymerase II, messenger RNA (mRNA), and nuclear protein levels were measured over 5 days after downregulation of Nanog, a key pluripotency regulator(13-15). Our data demonstrate how a single genetic perturbation leads to progressive widespread changes in several molecular regulatory layers, and provide a dynamic view of information flow in the epigenome, transcriptome and proteome. We observe that a large proportion of changes in nuclear protein levels are not accompanied by concordant changes in the expression of corresponding mRNAs, indicating important roles for translational and post-translational regulation of ESC fate. Gene-ontology analysis across different molecular layers indicates that although chromatin reconfiguration is important for altering cell fate, it is preceded by transcription-factor- mediated regulatory events. The temporal order of gene expression alterations shows the order of the regulatory network reconfiguration and offers further insight into the gene regulatory network. Our studies extend the conventional systems biology approach to include many molecular species, regulatory layers and temporal series, and underscore the complexity of the multi-layer regulatory mechanisms responsible for changes in protein expression that determine stem cell fate.","[Lu, Rong; Lemischka, Ihor R.] Princeton Univ, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Markowetz, Florian; Airoldi, Edoardo M.; Troyanskaya, Olga G.] Princeton Univ, Lewis Sigler Inst Integrat Genom, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Markowetz, Florian; Airoldi, Edoardo M.; Troyanskaya, Olga G.] Princeton Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Unwin, Richard D.; Whetton, Anthony D.] Univ Manchester, Wolfson Mol Imaging Ctr,Sch Canc & Imaging Sci, Manchester Acad Hlth Sci Ctr, Stem Cell & Leukaemia Prote Lab, Manchester M20 4QL, Lancs, England; [Leek, Jeffrey T.; MacArthur, Ben D.; Rozov, Roye; Lemischka, Ihor R.] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Gene & Cell Med, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Leek, Jeffrey T.; MacArthur, Ben D.; Rozov, Roye; Lemischka, Ihor R.] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Black Family Stem Cell Inst, New York, NY 10029 USA; [MacArthur, Ben D.; Lachmann, Alexander; Ma'ayan, Avi] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol & Syst Therapeut, New York, NY 10029 USA; [MacArthur, Ben D.; Lachmann, Alexander; Ma'ayan, Avi] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Syst Biol Ctr New York, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Boyer, Laurie A.] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Lemischka, IR (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",rlu@stanford.edu; ihor.lemischka@mssm.edu,"Airoldi, Edoardo/A-8575-2009; Unwin, Richard/C-1258-2008","Unwin, Richard/0000-0001-7955-9111; MacArthur, Ben/0000-0002-5396-9750; Airoldi, Edoardo/0000-0002-3512-0542; Leek, Jeffrey/0000-0002-2873-2671; WHETTON, ANTHONY/0000-0002-1098-3878; Markowetz, Florian/0000-0002-2784-5308; Lachmann, Alexander/0000-0002-1982-7652",NIH; BBSRC; Leukaemia Research UK; US National Science Foundation,"We would like to thank D.

The main bacterial translocase comprises the SecYEG protein-conducting channel and the peripheral ATPase motor SecA(2,3). Most proteins destined for the periplasm and beyond are exported post-translationally by SecA(2,3). Preprotein targeting to SecA is thought to involve signal peptides(4) and chaperones like SecB(5,6). Here we show that signal peptides have a new role beyond targeting: they are essential allosteric activators of the translocase. On docking on their binding groove on SecA, signal peptides act in trans to drive three successive states: first, 'triggering' that drives the translocase to a lower activation energy state; second, 'trapping' that engages non-native preprotein mature domains docked with high affinity on the secretion apparatus; and third, 'secretion' during which trapped mature domains undergo several turnovers of translocation in segments(7). A significant contribution by mature domains renders signal peptides less critical in bacterial secretory protein targeting than currently assumed. Rather, it is their function as allosteric activators of the translocase that renders signal peptides essential for protein secretion. A role for signal peptides and targeting sequences as allosteric activators may be universal in protein translocases.","[Gouridis, Giorgos; Karamanou, Spyridoula; Economou, Anastassios] Fdn Res & Technol Hellas, Inst Mol Biol & Biotechnol, Iraklion 71110, Crete, Greece; [Gouridis, Giorgos; Economou, Anastassios] Univ Crete, Dept Biol, Iraklion 71409, Crete, Greece; [Gelis, Ioannis; Kalodimos, Charalampos G.] Rutgers State Univ, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA","Economou, A (reprint author), Fdn Res & Technol Hellas, Inst Mol Biol & Biotechnol, Iraklion 71110, Crete, Greece.",aeconomo@imbb.forth.gr,"Economou, Anastassios/P-8292-2017","Economou, Anastassios/0000-0002-1770-507X",European Community [LSHC-CT-2006-037834/Streptomics]; Greek General Secretariat of Research and the European Regional Development Fund [PENED03ED623]; US National Institutes of Health [GM73854]; American Heart Association; Onassis Foundation,"Acknowledgements We are grateful to G.

Allosteric proteins can exist in several conformational states with distinct binding or enzymatic activity. Effectors are considered to function in a purely structural manner by selectively stabilizing a specific conformational state, thereby regulating protein activity. Here we show that allosteric proteins can be regulated predominantly by changes in their structural dynamics. We have used NMR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry to characterize cyclic AMP (cAMP) binding to the catabolite activator protein (CAP), a transcriptional activator that has been a prototype for understanding effector-mediated allosteric control of protein activity(7). cAMP switches CAP from the 'off' state (inactive), which binds DNA weakly and non-specifically, to the 'on' state (active), which binds DNA strongly and specifically. In contrast, cAMP binding to a single CAP mutant, CAP-S62F, fails to elicit the active conformation; yet, cAMP binding to CAP-S62F strongly activates the protein for DNA binding. NMR and thermodynamic analyses show that despite the fact that CAP-S62F-cAMP(2) adopts the inactive conformation, its strong binding to DNA is driven by a large conformational entropy originating in enhanced protein motions induced by DNA binding. The results provide strong evidence that changes in protein motions may activate allosteric proteins that are otherwise structurally inactive.","[Tzeng, Shiou-Ru; Kalodimos, Charalampos G.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; [Tzeng, Shiou-Ru; Kalodimos, Charalampos G.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA","Kalodimos, CG (reprint author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.",babis@rutgers.edu,,,National Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB618259],We are grateful to L.

Here we compared 3,665 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved and investigational drugs against hundreds of targets, defining each target by its ligands. Chemical similarities between drugs and ligand sets predicted thousands of unanticipated associations. Thirty were tested experimentally, including the antagonism of the beta(1) receptor by the transporter inhibitor Prozac, the inhibition of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) transporter by the ion channel drug Vadilex, and antagonism of the histamine H(4) receptor by the enzyme inhibitor Rescriptor. Overall, 23 new drug-target associations were confirmed, five of which were potent (<100 nM). The physiological relevance of one, the drug N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) on serotonergic receptors, was confirmed in a knockout mouse. The chemical similarity approach is systematic and comprehensive, and may suggest side-effects and new indications for many drugs.","[Keiser, Michael J.; Irwin, John J.; Laggner, Christian; Hert, Jerome; Thomas, Kelan L.

Inappropriate NOTCH activation is directly implicated in the pathogenesis of several disease states, including T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL). The treatment of leukaemic cells with SAHM1 results in genome-wide suppression of NOTCH-activated genes.

An earlier suggestion(8-10) that Li is more depleted in stars with planets was weakened by the lack of a proper comparison sample of stars without detected planets. Here we report Li abundances for an unbiased sample of solar-analogue stars with and without detected planets. We find that the planet-bearing stars have less than one per cent of the primordial Li abundance, while about 50 per cent of the solar analogues without detected planets have on average ten times more Li.

The first experimental evidence of the two-dimensional nature of graphene came from the observation of a sequence of plateaus in measurements of its transport properties in the presence of an applied magnetic field(1,2). These are signatures of the so-called integer quantum Hall effect. However, as a consequence of the relativistic character of the charge carriers, the integer quantum Hall effect observed in graphene is qualitatively different from its semiconductor analogue(3). As a third distinguishing feature of graphene, it has been conjectured that interactions and correlations should be important in this material, but surprisingly, evidence of collective behaviour in graphene is lacking. In particular, the quintessential collective quantum behaviour in two dimensions, the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE), has so far resisted observation in graphene despite intense efforts and theoretical predictions of its existence(4-9). Here we report the observation of the FQHE in graphene. Our observations are made possible by using suspended graphene devices probed by two-terminal charge transport measurements(10). This allows us to isolate the sample from substrate-induced perturbations that usually obscure the effects of interactions in this system and to avoid effects of finite geometry. At low carrier density, we find a field-induced transition to an insulator that competes with the FQHE, allowing its observation only in the highest quality samples. We believe that these results will open the door to the physics of FQHE and other collective behaviour in graphene.","[Du, Xu; Skachko, Ivan; Duerr, Fabian; Luican, Adina; Andrei, Eva Y.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Piscataway, NJ 08855 USA","Andrei, EY (reprint author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, POB 849, Piscataway, NJ 08855 USA.",eandrei@physics.rutgers.edu,,, [DE-FG02-99ER45742];  [NSF-DMR-045673],"Work was supported by DE-FG02-99ER45742 and partially supported by NSF-DMR-045673.

In this strong quantum regime, electrons and magnetic flux quanta bind to form complex composite quasiparticles with fractional electronic charge; these are manifest in transport measurements of the Hall conductivity as rational fractions of the elementary conductance quantum. The experimental discovery of an anomalous integer quantum Hall effect in graphene has enabled the study of a correlated two-dimensional electronic system, in which the interacting electrons behave like massless chiral fermions(3,4). However, owing to the prevailing disorder, graphene has so far exhibited only weak signatures of correlated electron phenomena(5,6), despite intense experimental and theoretical efforts(7-14). Here we report the observation of the fractional quantum Hall effect in ultraclean, suspended graphene. In addition, we show that at low carrier density graphene becomes an insulator with a magnetic-field-tunable energy gap. These newly discovered quantum states offer the opportunity to study correlated Dirac fermions in graphene in the presence of large magnetic fields.","[Bolotin, Kirill I.; Ghahari, Fereshte; Stormer, Horst L.; Kim, Philip] Columbia Univ, Dept Phys, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Shulman, Michael D.; Stormer, Horst L.; Kim, Philip] Columbia Univ, Dept Appl Phys & Appl Math, New York, NY 10027 USA","Kim, P (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Dept Phys, 538 W 120th St, New York, NY 10027 USA.",pk2015@columbia.edu,"Kim, Philip/N-1886-2013; Bolotin, Kirill/O-5101-2016",,Microsoft Project Q; DARPA; Department of Energy (DOE),"We thank D.

For simple chemical systems, it has been possible to map out in considerable detail the reactive potential-energy surfaces describing atomic motions and resultant reaction dynamics(1), but such studies remain challenging for complex chemical and biological transformations(2). A case in point is the green fluorescent protein (GFP)(3-5) from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria, which is a widely used gene expression marker owing to its efficient bioluminescence. This feature is known to arise from excited-state proton transfer (ESPT)(6-8), yet the atomistic details of the process are still not fully understood. Here we show that femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy(9,10) provides sufficiently detailed and time-resolved vibrational spectra of the electronically excited chromophore of GFP to reveal skeletal motions involved in the proton transfer that produces the fluorescent form of the protein. In particular, we observe that the frequencies and intensities of two marker bands, the C-O and C=N stretching modes at opposite ends of the conjugated chromophore, oscillate out of phase with a period of 280 fs; we attribute these oscillations to impulsively excited low-frequency phenoxyl-ring motions, which optimize the geometry of the chromophore for ESPT. Our findings illustrate that femtosecond simulated Raman spectroscopy is a powerful approach to revealing the real-time nuclear dynamics that make up a multidimensional polyatomic reaction coordinate.","[Fang, Chong; Frontiera, Renee R.; Tran, Rosalie; Mathies, Richard A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Mathies, RA (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",ramathies@berkeley.edu,"Fang, Chong/D-3681-2009; Frontiera, Renee/D-8131-2011","Frontiera, Renee/0000-0001-8218-7574; Fang, Chong/0000-0002-8879-1825",Mathies Royalty Fund,Plasmids were provided by R.

But, because of uncertainty in the delta(18)O of the primitive ocean, there is considerable debate regarding this conclusion. Examination of modern and ancient cherts indicates that another approach, using a combined analysis of delta(18)O and hydrogen isotopes (delta D) rather than delta(18)O alone, can provide a firmer constraint on formational temperatures without independent knowledge of the isotopic composition of ambient waters(4,5). Here we show that delta(18)O and delta D sampled from 3.42-billion-year-old Buck Reef Chert rocks in South Africa are consistent with formation from waters at varied low temperatures. The most (18)O-enriched Buck Reef Chert rocks record the lowest diagenetic temperatures and were formed in equilibrium with waters below similar to 40 degrees C. Geochemical and sedimentary evidence suggests that the Buck Reef Chert was formed in shallow to deep marine conditions, so our results indicate that the Palaeoarchaean ocean was isotopically depleted relative to the modern ocean and far cooler (<= 40 degrees) than previously thought(2).","[Hren, M.

The timescale for segregation and transport of these melts, which are ultimately responsible for formation of the Earth's crust, is critically dependent on the permeability of the partly molten asthenospheric mantle, yet this permeability is known mainly from semi-empirical and analogue models(1-6). Here we use a high-pressure, high-temperature centrifuge, at accelerations of 400g-700g, to measure the rate of basalt melt flow in olivine aggregates with porosities of 5-12 per cent. The resulting permeabilities are consistent with a microscopic model in which melt is completely connected, and are one to two orders of magnitude larger than predicted by current parameterizations(4,7). Extrapolation of the measurements to conditions characteristic(8) of asthenosphere below mid-ocean ridges yields proportionally higher transport speeds. Application of these results in a model(9) of porous-media channelling instabilities(10) yields melt transport times of similar to 1-2.5 kyr across the entire asthenosphere, which is sufficient to preserve the observed Th-230 excess of mid-ocean-ridge basalts and the mantle signatures of even shorter-lived isotopes such as Ra-226 (refs 5,11-14).","[Connolly, James A.

So far, the transcription factor FOXP2 (forkhead box P2) is the only gene implicated in Mendelian forms of human speech and language dysfunction(1-3). It has been proposed that the amino acid composition in the human variant of FOXP2 has undergone accelerated evolution, and this two-amino-acid change occurred around the time of language emergence in humans(4,5). However, this remains controversial, and whether the acquisition of these amino acids in human FOXP2 has any functional consequence in human neurons remains untested. Here we demonstrate that these two human-specific amino acids alter FOXP2 function by conferring differential transcriptional regulation in vitro. We extend these observations in vivo to human and chimpanzee brain, and use network analysis to identify novel relationships among the differentially expressed genes. These data provide experimental support for the functional relevance of changes in FOXP2 that occur on the human lineage, highlighting specific pathways with direct consequences for human brain development and disease in the central nervous system (CNS). Because FOXP2 has an important role in speech and language in humans, the identified targets may have a critical function in the development and evolution of language circuitry in humans.","[Konopka, Genevieve; Bomar, Jamee M.; Winden, Kellen; Geschwind, Daniel H.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Program Neurogenet, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Geschwind, Daniel H.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Semel Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Geschwind, Daniel H.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychiat, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Konopka, Genevieve; Bomar, Jamee M.; Winden, Kellen; Coppola, Giovanni; Gao, Fuying; Peng, Sophia; Geschwind, Daniel H.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Neurol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Geschwind, Daniel H.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Human Genet, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Wohlschlegel, James A.; Geschwind, Daniel H.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Biol Chem, David Geffen Sch Med, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Preuss, Todd M.] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Div Neurosci, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA; [Preuss, Todd M.] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Behav Neurosci, Yerkes Natl Primate Res Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA; [Preuss, Todd M.] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA","Konopka, G (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Program Neurogenet, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",gena@alum.mit.edu; dhg@ucla.edu,"Jonsson, Zophonias/E-1960-2015","Konopka, Genevieve/0000-0002-3363-7302",A.

Unlike the typical progressive loss of pyramidal-cell bias, direct recording from fast-spiking cells in vivo reveals a counterintuitive initial shift towards the occluded eye followed by a late preference for the open eye, consistent with a spike-timing-dependent plasticity rule for these inhibitory neurons.

Yet, it has not been possible to examine the unique developmental genetics of human germ-cell formation and differentiation owing to inaccessibility of germ cells during fetal development. Although several studies have shown that germ cells can be differentiated from mouse and human embryonic stem cells, human germ cells differentiated in these studies generally did not develop beyond the earliest stages(1-8). Here we used a germ-cell reporter to quantify and isolate primordial germ cells derived from both male and female human embryonic stem cells. By silencing and overexpressing genes that encode germ-cell-specific cytoplasmic RNA-binding proteins (not transcription factors), we modulated human germ-cell formation and developmental progression. We observed that human DAZL (deleted in azoospermia-like) functions in primordial germ cell formation, whereas closely related genes DAZ and BOULE (also called BOLL) promote later stages of meiosis and development of haploid gametes.

To evoke the mucosal immune response, antigens on the mucosal surface must be transported across the epithelial barrier into organized lymphoid structures such as Peyer's patches(4). This function, called antigen transcytosis, is mediated by specialized epithelial M cells(5,6). The molecular mechanisms promoting this antigen uptake, however, are largely unknown. Here we report that glycoprotein 2 (GP2), specifically expressed on the apical plasma membrane of M cells among enterocytes, serves as a transcytotic receptor for mucosal antigens. Recombinant GP2 protein selectively bound a subset of commensal and pathogenic enterobacteria, including Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium), by recognizing FimH, a component of type I pili on the bacterial outer membrane. Consistently, these bacteria were colocalized with endogenous GP2 on the apical plasma membrane as well as in cytoplasmic vesicles in M cells. Moreover, deficiency of bacterial FimH or host GP2 led to defects in transcytosis of type-I-piliated bacteria through M cells, resulting in an attenuation of antigen-specific immune responses in Peyer's patches. GP2 is therefore a previously unrecognized transcytotic receptor on M cells for type-I-piliated bacteria and is a prerequisite for the mucosal immune response to these bacteria. Given that M cells are considered a promising target for oral vaccination against various infectious diseases(7,8), the GP2-dependent transcytotic pathway could provide a new target for the development of M-cell-targeted mucosal vaccines.","[Hase, Koji; Kawano, Kazuya; Fukuda, Shinji; Ebisawa, Masashi; Kadokura, Kazunori; Fujimura, Yumiko; Kawano, Sayaka; Nakato, Gaku; Kimura, Shunsuke; Murakami, Takaya; Ohno, Hiroshi] RIKEN, Res Ctr Allergy & Immunol, Lab Epithelial Immunobiol, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Nochi, Tomonori; Pontes, Gemilson Soares; Kiyono, Hiroshi] Univ Tokyo, Inst Med Sci, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; [Fukuda, Shinji; Ebisawa, Masashi; Kadokura, Kazunori; Nakato, Gaku; Ohno, Hiroshi] Yokohama City Univ, Int Grad Sch Bionanosci, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Tobe, Toru] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Med, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Yabashi, Atsuko; Waguri, Satoshi] Fukushima Med Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Histol, Fukushima 9601295, Japan; [Iimura, Mitsutoshi; Hamura, Kimiyo] Tokyo Womens Med Univ, Inst Gastroenterol, Tokyo 1628666, Japan; [Fukuoka, Shin-Ichi] Aoyama Gakuin Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Dept Chem & Biol Sci, Kanagawa 2298558, Japan; [Lowe, Anson W.] Stanford Univ, Dept Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lowe, Anson W.] Stanford Univ, Ctr Digest Dis, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Itoh, Kikuji] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Tokyo 1138657, Japan","Ohno, H (reprint author), RIKEN, Res Ctr Allergy & Immunol, Lab Epithelial Immunobiol, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan.",ohno@rcai.riken.jp,"Kimura, Shunsuke/D-7093-2012; Ohno, Hiroshi/L-7899-2014","Kimura, Shunsuke/0000-0001-9408-2884; Ohno, Hiroshi/0000-0001-8776-9661","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan; Takeda Science Foundation; NIH [DK56339, DK43294]","We thank K.

In contrast, replication forks must traverse such cohesin-associated obstructions to duplicate the entire genome in S phase. How this occurs is unknown. Through single-molecule analysis, we demonstrate that the replication factor C (RFC)-CTF18 clamp loader (RFC(CTF18))(1,7) controls the velocity, spacing and restart activity of replication forks in human cells and is required for robust acetylation of cohesin's SMC3 subunit and sister chromatid cohesion. Unexpectedly, we discovered that cohesin acetylation itself is a central determinant of fork processivity, as slow-moving replication forks were found in cells lacking the Eco1-related acetyltransferases ESCO1 or ESCO2 (refs 8 -10) (including those derived from Roberts' syndrome patients, in whom ESCO2 is biallelically mutated(11)) and in cells expressing a form of SMC3 that cannot be acetylated. This defect was a consequence of cohesin's hyperstable interaction with two regulatory cofactors, WAPL and PDS5A (refs 12, 13); removal of either cofactor allowed forks to progress rapidly without ESCO1, ESCO2, or RFC(CTF18). Our results show a novel mechanism for clamp-loader-dependent fork progression, mediated by the post-translational modification and structural remodelling of the cohesin ring. Loss of this regulatory mechanism leads to the spontaneous accrual of DNA damage and may contribute to the abnormalities of the Roberts' syndrome cohesinopathy.","[Terret, Marie-Emilie; Sherwood, Rebecca; Rahman, Sadia; Jallepalli, Prasad V.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Program Mol Biol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Qin, Jun] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Ctr Mol Discovery, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Jallepalli, PV (reprint author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Program Mol Biol, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10065 USA.",jallepap@mskcc.org,"TERRET, Marie-Emilie/R-5782-2017","TERRET, Marie-Emilie/0000-0001-5843-925X",National Institutes of Health; Pew Scholar in the Biochemical Sciences award,"We thank D.

Many transcription factors bind to regulatory DNA elements distant from gene promoters. Although distal binding sites have been shown to regulate transcription by long-range chromatin interactions at a few loci, chromatin interactions and their impact on transcription regulation have not been investigated in a genome-wide manner. Here we describe the development of a new strategy, chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET) for the de novo detection of global chromatin interactions, with which we have comprehensively mapped the chromatin interaction network bound by oestrogen receptor alpha (ER-alpha) in the human genome. We found that most high-confidence remote ER-alpha-binding sites are anchored at gene promoters through long-range chromatin interactions, suggesting that ER-alpha functions by extensive chromatin looping to bring genes together for coordinated transcriptional regulation.

Although transcription factor occupancy can now be identified at genome-wide scales, decoding this regulatory landscape remains a daunting challenge. Here we used a novel approach to predict spatio-temporal cis-regulatory activity based only on in vivo transcription factor binding and enhancer activity data. We generated a high-resolution atlas of cis-regulatory modules describing their temporal and combinatorial occupancy during Drosophila mesoderm development. The binding profiles of cis-regulatory modules with characterized expression were used to train support vector machines to predict five spatio-temporal expression patterns. In vivo transgenic reporter assays demonstrate the high accuracy of these predictions and reveal an unanticipated plasticity in transcription factor binding leading to similar expression. This data-driven approach does not require previous knowledge of transcription factor sequence affinity, function or expression, making it widely applicable.","[Zinzen, Robert P.; Girardot, Charles; Gagneur, Julien; Braun, Martina; Furlong, Eileen E.

If there is accretion after neutron-star formation, the atmosphere could be composed of light elements (H or He); if no accretion takes place or if thermonuclear reactions occur after accretion, heavy elements (for example, Fe) are expected. Despite detailed searches, observations have been unable to confirm the atmospheric composition of isolated neutron stars(1). Here we report an analysis of archival observations of the compact X-ray source in the centre of the Cassiopeia A supernova remnant. We show that a carbon atmosphere neutron star (with low magnetic field) produces a good fit to the spectrum. Our emission model, in contrast with others(2-4), implies an emission size consistent with theoretical predictions for the radius of neutron stars. This result suggests that there is nuclear burning in the surface layers(5,6) and also identifies the compact source as a very young (similar to 330-year-old) neutron star.","[Ho, Wynn C.

One approach is to use macroscopic, effectively thermodynamic ensembles of ultracold atoms to create quantum gases and strongly correlated states of matter, and to analyse the bulk properties of the ensemble. For example, bosonic and fermionic atoms in a Hubbard-regime optical lattice(1-5) can be used for quantum simulations of solid-state models(6). The opposite approach is to build up microscopic quantum systems atom-by-atom, with complete control over all degrees of freedom(7-9). The atoms or ions act as qubits and allow the realization of quantum gates, with the goal of creating highly controllable quantum information systems. Until now, the macroscopic and microscopic strategies have been fairly disconnected. Here we present a quantum gas 'microscope' that bridges the two approaches, realizing a system in which atoms of a macroscopic ensemble are detected individually and a complete set of degrees of freedom for each of them is determined through preparation and measurement. By implementing a high-resolution optical imaging system, single atoms are detected with near-unity fidelity on individual sites of a Hubbard-regime optical lattice. The lattice itself is generated by projecting a holographic mask through the imaging system. It has an arbitrary geometry, chosen to support both strong tunnel coupling between lattice sites and strong on-site confinement. Our approach can be used to directly detect strongly correlated states of matter; in the context of condensed matter simulation, this corresponds to the detection of individual electrons in the simulated crystal. Also, the quantum gas microscope may enable addressing and read-out of large-scale quantum information systems based on ultracold atoms.","[Bakr, Waseem S.; Gillen, Jonathon I.; Peng, Amy; Foelling, Simon; Greiner, Markus] Harvard Univ, Harvard MIT Ctr Ultracold Atoms, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Bakr, Waseem S.; Gillen, Jonathon I.; Peng, Amy; Foelling, Simon; Greiner, Markus] Harvard Univ, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Greiner, M (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Harvard MIT Ctr Ultracold Atoms, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",greiner@physics.harvard.edu,"Greiner, Markus/A-8502-2010","Folling, Simon/0000-0002-6951-3651",NSF; AFOSR MURI; DARPA; Alfred P.

Applied to the propagation of light, periodicity gives rise to photonic crystals(1), which can be precisely engineered for such applications as guiding and dispersing optical beams(2,3), tightly confining and trapping light resonantly(4), and enhancing nonlinear optical interactions(5). Photonic crystals can also be formed into planar lightwave circuits for the integration of optical and electrical microsystems(6). In a photonic crystal, the periodicity of the host medium is used to manipulate the properties of light, whereas a phononic crystal uses periodicity to manipulate mechanical vibrations(7-13). As has been demonstrated in studies of Raman-like scattering in epitaxially grown vertical cavity structures(14) and photonic crystal fibres(15), the simultaneous confinement of mechanical and optical modes in periodic structures can lead to greatly enhanced light-matter interactions. A logical next step is thus to create planar circuits that act as both photonic and phononic crystals(16): optomechanical crystals. Here we describe the design, fabrication and characterization of a planar, silicon-chip-based optomechanical crystal capable of co-localizing and strongly coupling 200-terahertz photons and 2-gigahertz phonons. These planar optomechanical crystals bring the powerful techniques of optics and photonic crystals to bear on phononic crystals, providing exquisitely sensitive (near quantum-limited), optical measurements of mechanical vibrations, while simultaneously providing strong nonlinear interactions for optics in a large and technologically relevant range of frequencies.","[Eichenfield, Matt; Chan, Jasper; Camacho, Ryan M.; Vahala, Kerry J.; Painter, Oskar] CALTECH, Thomas J Watson Sr Lab Appl Phys, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Painter, O (reprint author), CALTECH, Thomas J Watson Sr Lab Appl Phys, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",opainter@caltech.edu,"Camacho, Ryan/B-1841-2010; Chan, Jasper/E-6801-2011","Camacho, Ryan/0000-0001-9644-1422; Painter, Oskar/0000-0002-1581-9209","DARPA [HR0011-08-0002]; National Science Foundation [0622246, DMR-0520565, EEC-0812072]","Funding for this work was provided by a DARPA seed grant (grant no.

For hard-sphere colloids, which interact only as a result of excluded volume, phase behaviour is controlled by volume fraction, phi; an increase in phi drives the system towards its glassy state, analogously to a decrease in temperature, T, in molecular systems. When phi increases above phi* approximate to 0.53, the viscosity starts to increase significantly, and the system eventually moves out of equilibrium at the glass transition, phi(g) approximate to 0.58, where particle crowding greatly restricts structural relaxation(1-4). The large particle size makes it possible to study both structure and dynamics with light scattering(1) and imaging(3,4); colloidal suspensions have therefore provided considerable insight into the glass transition. However, hard-sphere colloidal suspensions do not exhibit the same diversity of behaviour as molecular glasses. This is highlighted by the wide variation in behaviour observed for the viscosity or structural relaxation time, tau(alpha), when the glassy state is approached in supercooled molecular liquids(5). This variation is characterized by the unifying concept of fragility(5), which has spurred the search for a 'universal' description of dynamic arrest in glass-forming liquids. For 'fragile' liquids, tau(alpha) is highly sensitive to changes in T, whereas non-fragile, or 'strong', liquids show a much lower T sensitivity. In contrast, hard-sphere colloidal suspensions are restricted to fragile behaviour, as determined by their phi dependence(1,6), ultimately limiting their utility in the study of the glass transition. Here we show that deformable colloidal particles, when studied through their concentration dependence at fixed temperature, do exhibit the same variation in fragility as that observed in the T dependence of molecular liquids at fixed volume.

Plate tectonics gives no insight, however, into where and when earthquakes will occur within plates, because the interiors of ideal plates should not deform. As a result, within plate interiors, assessments of earthquake hazards rely heavily on the assumption that the locations of small earthquakes shown by the short historical record reflect continuing deformation that will cause future large earthquakes(1). Here, however, we show that many of these recent earthquakes are probably aftershocks of large earthquakes that occurred hundreds of years ago. We present a simple model predicting that the length of aftershock sequences varies inversely with the rate at which faults are loaded. Aftershock sequences within the slowly deforming continents are predicted to be significantly longer than the decade typically observed at rapidly loaded plate boundaries. These predictions are in accord with observations. So the common practice of treating continental earthquakes as steady-state seismicity overestimates the hazard in presently active areas and underestimates it elsewhere.","[Stein, Seth] Northwestern Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Liu, Mian] Univ Missouri, Dept Geol Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA","Stein, S (reprint author), Northwestern Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",seth@earth.northwestern.edu,,,NSF/OISE [0730154]; Chinese Academy of Sciences,"We thank Y.

Although bet hedging is found in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans(4-10), direct evidence for an adaptive origin of this behaviour is lacking(11). Here we report the de novo evolution of bet hedging in experimental bacterial populations. Bacteria were subjected to an environment that continually favoured new phenotypic states. Initially, our regime drove the successive evolution of novel phenotypes by mutation and selection; however, in two (of 12) replicates this trend was broken by the evolution of bet-hedging genotypes that persisted because of rapid stochastic phenotype switching. Genome re-sequencing of one of these switching types revealed nine mutations that distinguished it from the ancestor. The final mutation was both necessary and sufficient for rapid phenotype switching; nonetheless, the evolution of bet hedging was contingent upon earlier mutations that altered the relative fitness effect of the final mutation. These findings capture the adaptive evolution of bet hedging in the simplest of organisms, and suggest that risk-spreading strategies may have been among the earliest evolutionary solutions to life in fluctuating environments.","[Beaumont, Hubertus J.

Despite this seemingly absolute seclusion, central nervous system tissues are subject to immune surveillance and are vulnerable to autoimmune attacks(1). Using intravital two-photon imaging in a Lewis rat model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, here we present in real-time the interactive processes between effector T cells and cerebral structures from their first arrival to manifest autoimmune disease. We observed that incoming effector T cells successively scanned three planes. The T cells got arrested to leptomeningeal vessels and immediately monitored the luminal surface, crawling preferentially against the blood flow. After diapedesis, the cells continued their scan on the abluminal vascular surface and the underlying leptomeningeal (pial) membrane. There, the T cells encountered phagocytes that effectively present antigens, foreign as well as myelin proteins. These contacts stimulated the effector T cells to produce pro-inflammatory mediators, and provided a trigger to tissue invasion and the formation of inflammatory infiltrations.","[Bartholomaeus, Ingo; Kawakami, Naoto; Odoardi, Francesca; Schlaeger, Christian; Miljkovic, Djordje; Klinkert, Wolfgang E.

However, it remains unknown whether a mechanism exists that integrates these nucleic-acid-sensing systems. Here we show that high-mobility group box (HMGB) proteins 1, 2 and 3 function as universal sentinels for nucleic acids. HMGBs bind to all immunogenic nucleic acids examined with a correlation between affinity and immunogenic potential. Hmgb1(-/-) and Hmgb2(-/-) mouse cells are defective in type-I interferon and inflammatory cytokine induction by DNA or RNA targeted to activate the cytosolic nucleic-acid-sensing receptors; cells in which the expression of all three HMGBs is suppressed show a more profound defect, accompanied by impaired activation of the transcription factors interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B. The absence of HMGBs also severely impairs the activation of TLR3, TLR7 and TLR9 by their cognate nucleic acids. Our results therefore indicate a hierarchy in the nucleic-acid-mediated activation of immune responses, wherein the selective activation of nucleic-acid-sensing receptors is contingent on the more promiscuous sensing of nucleic acids by HMGBs. These findings may have implications for understanding the evolution of the innate immune system and for the treatment of immunological disorders.","[Yanai, Hideyuki; Ban, Tatsuma; Wang, ZhiChao; Choi, Myoung Kwon; Negishi, Hideo; Nakasato, Makoto; Lu, Yan; Hangai, Sho; Koshiba, Ryuji; Savitsky, David; Honda, Kenya; Tamura, Tomohiko; Taniguchi, Tadatsugu] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Med, Dept Immunol, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Yanai, Hideyuki; Ban, Tatsuma; Wang, ZhiChao; Choi, Myoung Kwon; Negishi, Hideo; Nakasato, Makoto; Lu, Yan; Hangai, Sho; Koshiba, Ryuji; Savitsky, David; Honda, Kenya; Tamura, Tomohiko; Taniguchi, Tadatsugu] Univ Tokyo, Fac Med, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Kawamura, Takeshi; Kodama, Tatsuhiko] Univ Tokyo, RCAST, Lab Syst Biol & Med, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1538904, Japan; [Ronfani, Lorenza; Bianchi, Marco E.] San Raffaele Univ, Fac Med, I-20132 Milan, Italy; [Akira, Shizuo] Osaka Univ, WPI Immunol Frontier Res Ctr, Host Def Lab, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan","Taniguchi, T (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Med, Dept Immunol, Bunkyo Ku, Hongo 7-3-1, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",tada@m.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Akira, Shizuo/C-3134-2009; Honda, Kenya/N-5297-2015","Bianchi, Marco Emilio/0000-0002-5329-6445","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan; Korea Science and Engineering Foundation; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","We thank C.

They have also been implicated in cellular transformation and tumorigenesis(2-6). However, despite extensive biochemical characterization of NF-kappa B signalling during the past twenty years, the requirement for NF-kappa B in tumour development in vivo, particularly in solid tumours, is not completely understood. Here we show that the NF-kappa B pathway is required for the development of tumours in a mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma. Concomitant loss of p53 (also known as Trp53) and expression of oncogenic Kras(G12D) resulted in NF-kappa B activation in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Conversely, in lung tumour cell lines expressing Kras(G12D) and lacking p53, p53 restoration led to NF-kappa B inhibition. Furthermore, the inhibition of NF-kappa B signalling induced apoptosis in p53-null lung cancer cell lines. Inhibition of the pathway in lung tumours in vivo, from the time of tumour initiation or after tumour progression, resulted in significantly reduced tumour development. Together, these results indicate a critical function for NF-kappa B signalling in lung tumour development and, further, that this requirement depends on p53 status. These findings also provide support for the development of NF-kappa B inhibitory drugs as targeted therapies for the treatment of patients with defined mutations in Kras and p53.","[Meylan, Etienne; Dooley, Alison L.; Feldser, David M.; Shen, Lynn; Turk, Erin; Ouyang, Chensi; Jacks, Tyler] MIT, Koch Inst Integrat Canc Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Meylan, Etienne; Dooley, Alison L.; Feldser, David M.; Shen, Lynn; Turk, Erin; Ouyang, Chensi; Jacks, Tyler] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Meylan, Etienne; Dooley, Alison L.; Feldser, David M.; Shen, Lynn; Turk, Erin; Ouyang, Chensi; Jacks, Tyler] MIT, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Jacks, T (reprint author), MIT, Koch Inst Integrat Canc Res, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",tjacks@mit.edu,,"Meylan, Etienne/0000-0002-0899-2230",Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NCI [P30-CA14051]; International Human Frontier Science Program Organization; Swiss National Science Foundation; Leukemia & Lymphoma Society Fellow Award,"We thank D.

Although the identification of specific oncogenes has led to the development of clinically effective, molecularly targeted therapies in some cases, KRAS has remained refractory to this approach. A complementary strategy for targeting KRAS is to identify gene products that, when inhibited, result in cell death only in the presence of an oncogenic allele(1,2). Here we have used systematic RNA interference to detect synthetic lethal partners of oncogenic KRAS and found that the non-canonical I kappa B kinase TBK1 was selectively essential in cells that contain mutant KRAS. Suppression of TBK1 induced apoptosis specifically in human cancer cell lines that depend on oncogenic KRAS expression. In these cells, TBK1 activated NF-kappa B anti-apoptotic signals involving c-Rel and BCL-XL (also known as BCL2L1) that were essential for survival, providing mechanistic insights into this synthetic lethal interaction. These observations indicate that TBK1 and NF-kappa B signalling are essential in KRAS mutant tumours, and establish a general approach for the rational identification of co-dependent pathways in cancer.","[Barbie, David A.; Kim, So Young; Moody, Susan E.; Dunn, Ian F.; Schinzel, Anna C.; Mermel, Craig; Sheng, Qing; Livingston, David M.; Meyerson, Matthew; Gilliland, D.

These functions are accomplished in nature by only a limited number of redox-active agents. A long-standing issue in these fields is how redox potentials are fine-tuned over a broad range with little change to the redox-active site or electron-transfer properties. Resolving this issue will not only advance our fundamental understanding of the roles of long-range, non-covalent interactions in redox processes, but also allow for design of redox-active proteins having tailor-made redox potentials for applications such as artificial photosynthetic centres(1,2) or fuel cell catalysts(3) for energy conversion. Here we show that two important secondary coordination sphere interactions, hydrophobicity and hydrogen-bonding, are capable of tuning the reduction potential of the cupredoxin azurin over a 700 mV range, surpassing the highest and lowest reduction potentials reported for any mononuclear cupredoxin, without perturbing the metal binding site beyond what is typical for the cupredoxin family of proteins. We also demonstrate that the effects of individual structural features are additive and that redox potential tuning of azurin is now predictable across the full range of cupredoxin potentials.","[Marshall, Nicholas M.; Garner, Dewain K.; Wilson, Tiffany D.; Gao, Yi-Gui; Nilges, Mark J.; Lu, Yi] Univ Illinois, Dept Chem, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Robinson, Howard] Brookhaven Natl Lab, Dept Biol, Upton, NY 11973 USA","Lu, Y (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Dept Chem, 1209 W Calif St, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",yi-lu@illinois.edu,"Lu, Yi/B-5461-2010","Lu, Yi/0000-0003-1221-6709",US National Science Foundation [CHE 05-52008]; National Institutes of Health [5 T32 GM070421]; National Institute of General Medical Sciences,"This material is based on work supported by the US National Science Foundation under award no.

Nitrous oxide (N(2)O) is a greenhouse gas that is an intermediate during the biological process known as denitrification(2). Copper-containing nitrite reductase (CuNIR) is a key enzyme in the process; it produces a precursor for N(2)O by catalysing the one-electron reduction of nitrite (NO(2)(-)) to nitric oxide (NO)(3). The reduction step is performed by an efficient electron-transfer reaction with a redox-partner protein(4-6). However, details of the mechanism during the electron-transfer reaction are still unknown. Here we show the high-resolution crystal structure of the electron-transfer complex for CuNIR with its cognate cytochrome c as the electron donor. The hydrophobic electron-transfer path is formed at the docking interface by desolvation owing to close contact between the two proteins. Structural analysis of the interface highlights an essential role for the loop region with a hydrophobic patch for protein-protein recognition; it also shows how interface construction allows the variation in atomic components to achieve diverse biological electron transfers.","[Nojiri, Masaki; Koteishi, Hiroyasu; Nakagami, Takuya; Yamaguchi, Kazuya; Suzuki, Shinnichiro] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Chem, Osaka 5600043, Japan; [Kobayashi, Kazuo] Osaka Univ, Inst Sci & Ind Res, Osaka 5670047, Japan; [Inoue, Tsuyoshi] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Chem Mat, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan","Nojiri, M (reprint author), Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Chem, Osaka 5600043, Japan.",nojiri@ch.wani.osaka-u.ac.jp; bic@ch.wani.osaka-u.ac.jp,"Kobayashi, Kazuo/H-9279-2012",,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan [20750137]; Sumitomo Foundation;  [20350078]","We thank A.

Here I examine evidence for the hypothesis that the Moon and the Earth were essentially dry immediately after the formation of the Moon-by a giant impact on the proto-Earth-and only much later gained volatiles through accretion of wet material delivered from beyond the asteroid belt. This view is supported by U-Pb and I-Xe chronologies, which show that water delivery peaked similar to 100 million years after the isolation of the Solar System. Introduction of water into the terrestrial mantle triggered plate tectonics, which may have been crucial for the emergence of life.

The feasibility of obtaining genome sequences from experimentally evolving populations offers the opportunity to investigate this relationship with new precision. Here we sequence genomes sampled through 40,000 generations from a laboratory population of Escherichia coli. Although adaptation decelerated sharply, genomic evolution was nearly constant for 20,000 generations. Such clock-like regularity is usually viewed as the signature of neutral evolution, but several lines of evidence indicate that almost all of these mutations were beneficial. This same population later evolved an elevated mutation rate and accumulated hundreds of additional mutations dominated by a neutral signature. Thus, the coupling between genomic and adaptive evolution is complex and can be counterintuitive even in a constant environment. In particular, beneficial substitutions were surprisingly uniform over time, whereas neutral substitutions were highly variable.","[Barrick, Jeffrey E.; Lenski, Richard E.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Microbiol & Mol Genet, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Yu, Dong Su; Yoon, Sung Ho; Jeong, Haeyoung; Oh, Tae Kwang; Kim, Jihyun F.] Korea Res Inst Biosci & Biotechnol, Ind Biotechnol & Bioenergy Res Ctr, Taejon 305806, South Korea; [Yu, Dong Su] Chungnam Natl Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Taejon 305764, South Korea; [Oh, Tae Kwang] 21C Frontier Microbial Genom & Applicat Ctr, Taejon 305806, South Korea; [Schneider, Dominique] Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, UMR 5163, Inst Jean Roget,Lab Adaptat & Pathogenie Microorg, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France; [Kim, Jihyun F.] Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Sci, Funct Genom Program, Taejon 305333, South Korea","Lenski, RE (reprint author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Microbiol & Mol Genet, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",lenski@msu.edu; jfk@kribb.re.kr,"Barrick, Jeffrey/A-3046-2012; Kim, Jihyun/B-6286-2013; Schneider, Dominique/M-6019-2014","Kim, Jihyun/0000-0001-7715-6992; Lenski, Richard/0000-0002-1064-8375","DARPA 'Fun Bio' Program; US National Science Foundation; Agence Nationale de la Recherche Programme 'Genomique Microbienne a Grande Echelle, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, and Universite Joseph Fourier; Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, Republic of Korea","We thank collaborators in the Lenski and Schneider laboratories for sharing unpublished data; N.

By comprehensively analysing the three-dimensional structures of protein-DNA complexes, here we show that the binding of arginine residues to narrow minor grooves is a widely used mode for protein-DNA recognition. This readout mechanism exploits the phenomenon that narrow minor grooves strongly enhance the negative electrostatic potential of the DNA. The nucleosome core particle offers a prominent example of this effect. Minor-groove narrowing is often associated with the presence of A-tracts, AT-rich sequences that exclude the flexible TpA step. These findings indicate that the ability to detect local variations in DNA shape and electrostatic potential is a general mechanism that enables proteins to use information in the minor groove, which otherwise offers few opportunities for the formation of base-specific hydrogen bonds, to achieve DNA-binding specificity.","[Rohs, Remo; West, Sean M.; Sosinsky, Alona; Liu, Peng; Honig, Barry] Columbia Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, Ctr Computat Biol & Bioinformat, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10032 USA","Honig, B (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, Ctr Computat Biol & Bioinformat, Howard Hughes Med Inst, 1130 St Nicholas Ave, New York, NY 10032 USA.",rsm10@columbia.edu; bh6@columbia.edu,"Rohs, Remo/F-5752-2011",,"National Institutes of Health (NIH) [GM54510, U54 CA121852]",This work was supported by National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants GM54510 (R.

Their rapidly fading afterglows are often bright enough at optical wavelengths that they are detectable at cosmological distances. Hitherto, the highest known redshift for a GRB was z = 6.7 (ref. 1), for GRB 080913, and for a galaxy was z = 6.96 (ref. 2). Here we report observations of GRB 090423 and the near-infrared spectroscopic measurement of its redshift, z = 8.1(-0.3)(+0.1). This burst happened when the Universe was only about 4 per cent of its current age(3). Its properties are similar to those of GRBs observed at low/intermediate redshifts, suggesting that the mechanisms and progenitors that gave rise to this burst about 600,000,000 years after the Big Bang are not markedly different from those producing GRBs about 10,000,000,000 years later.","[Salvaterra, R.; Campana, S.; Chincarini, G.; Covino, S.; D'Avanzo, P.; Margutti, R.; Thoene, C.

This so-called ponderomotive force(1) plays a major part in a variety of physical situations such as Paul traps(2,3) for charged particles, electron diffraction in strong (standing) laser fields(4-6) (the Kapitza-Dirac effect) and laser-based particle acceleration(7-9). Comparably weak forces on neutral atoms in inhomogeneous light fields may arise from the dynamical polarization of an atom(10-12); these are physically similar to the cycle-averaged forces. Here we observe previously unconsidered extremely strong kinematic forces on neutral atoms in short-pulse laser fields. We identify the ponderomotive force on electrons as the driving mechanism, leading to ultrastrong acceleration of neutral atoms with a magnitude as high as similar to 10(14) times the Earth's gravitational acceleration, g. To our knowledge, this is by far the highest observed acceleration on neutral atoms in external fields and may lead to new applications in both fundamental and applied physics.","[Eichmann, U.; Nubbemeyer, T.; Rottke, H.; Sandner, W.] Max Born Inst, D-12489 Berlin, Germany; [Eichmann, U.; Sandner, W.] Tech Univ Berlin, Inst Opt & Atomare Phys, D-10632 Berlin, Germany","Eichmann, U (reprint author), Max Born Inst, Max Born Str 2A, D-12489 Berlin, Germany.",ulli.eichmann@mbi-berlin.de,,,,,,25,87,91,6,52,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,29-Oct,2009,461,7268,,,,,1261,U93,,10.1038/nature08481,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,511TF,WOS:000271190800044,19865167.0,No,,,11/20/17,w.,sandner,na,na,na,na,na

Dynamical decoupling(3-9), which uses stroboscopic spin flips to give an average coupling to the environment that is effectively zero, is a particularly promising strategy for combating decoherence because it can be naturally integrated with other desired functionalities, such as quantum gates. Errors are inevitably introduced in each spin flip, so it is desirable to minimize the number of control pulses used to realize dynamical decoupling having a given level of precision. Such optimal dynamical decoupling sequences have recently been explored(9-12). The experimental realization of optimal dynamical decoupling in solid-state systems, however, remains elusive. Here we use pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance to demonstrate experimentally optimal dynamical decoupling for preserving electron spin coherence in irradiated malonic acid crystals at temperatures from 50 K to room temperature. Using a seven-pulse optimal dynamical decoupling sequence, we prolonged the spin coherence time to about 30 mu s; it would otherwise be about 0.04 mu s without control or 6.2 mu s under one-pulse control. By comparing experiments with microscopic theories, we have identified the relevant electron spin decoherence mechanisms in the solid. Optimal dynamical decoupling may be applied to other solid-state systems, such as diamonds with nitrogen-vacancy centres(13-15), and so lay the foundation for quantum coherence control of spins in solids at room temperature.","[Du, Jiangfeng; Rong, Xing; Wang, Ya; Yang, Jiahui] Univ Sci & Technol China, Hefei Natl Lab Phys Sci Microscale, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Du, Jiangfeng; Rong, Xing; Wang, Ya; Yang, Jiahui] Univ Sci & Technol China, Dept Modern Phys, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Nan; Liu, R.

Andesite petrogenesis is therefore fundamental in terms of both volcanic hazard and differentiation of the Earth. Andesites typically contain a significant proportion of crystals showing disequilibrium petrographic characteristics indicative of mixing or mingling between silicic and mafic magmas, which fuels a long-standing debate regarding the significance of these processes in andesite petrogenesis(2) and ultimately questions the abundance of true liquids with andesitic composition. Central to this debate is the distinction between liquids (or melts) and magmas, mixtures of liquids with crystals, which may or may not be co-genetic. With this distinction comes the realization that bulk-rock chemical analyses of petrologically complex andesites can lead to a blurred picture of the fundamental processes behind arc magmatism. Here we present an alternative view of andesite petrogenesis, based on a review of quenched glassy melt inclusions trapped in phenocrysts, whole-rock chemistry, and high-pressure and high-temperature experiments. We argue that true liquids of intermediate composition (59 to 66 wt% SiO(2)) are far less common in the sub-volcanic reservoirs of arc volcanoes than is suggested by the abundance of erupted magma within this compositional range. Effective mingling within upper crustal magmatic reservoirs obscures a compositional bimodality of melts ascending from the lower crust, and masks the fundamental role of silicic melts (>= 66 wt% SiO(2)) beneath intermediate arc volcanoes. This alternative view resolves several puzzling aspects of arc volcanism and provides important clues to the integration of plutonic and volcanic records.","[Reubi, Olivier; Blundy, Jon] Univ Bristol, Dept Earth Sci, Bristol BS8 1RJ, Avon, England","Reubi, O (reprint author), ETH, Inst Isotope Geochem & Mineral Resources, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",olivier.reubi@erdw.ethz.ch,,,Marie Curie Fellowship; NERC,"This work was supported by a Marie Curie Fellowship (O.

Two biophysical mechanisms have become established as the most promising magnetodetection candidates. The iron-mineral-based hypothesis suggests that magnetic information is detected by magnetoreceptors in the upper beak and transmitted through the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve to the brain(5-10). The light-dependent hypothesis suggests that magnetic field direction is sensed by radical pair-forming photopigments in the eyes(11-15) and that this visual signal is processed in cluster N, a specialized, night-time active, light-processing forebrain region(16-19). Here we report that European robins with bilateral lesions of cluster N are unable to show oriented magnetic-compass-guided behaviour but are able to perform sun compass and star compass orientation behaviour. In contrast, bilateral section of the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve in European robins did not influence the birds' ability to use their magnetic compass for orientation. These data show that cluster N is required for magnetic compass orientation in this species and indicate that it may be specifically involved in processing of magnetic compass information. Furthermore, the data strongly suggest that a vision-mediated mechanism underlies the magnetic compass in this migratory songbird, and that the putative iron-mineral-based receptors in the upper beak connected to the brain by the trigeminal nerve(6-8) are neither necessary nor sufficient for magnetic compass orientation in European robins.","[Zapka, Manuela; Heyers, Dominik; Hein, Christine M.; Engels, Svenja; Schneider, Nils-Lasse; Hans, Joerg; Weiler, Simon; Dreyer, David; Kishkinev, Dmitry; Mouritsen, Henrik] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, IBU, AG Neurosensorik Anim Nav, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany; [Wild, J.
