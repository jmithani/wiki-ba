Mechanistic understanding of presenilin and SPP has been hamperedby lack of relevant structural information. Here we report the crystal structure of a presenilin/SPP homologue (PSH) from the archaeon Methanoculleus marisnigri JR1. The protease, comprising nine transmembrane segments (TMs), adopts a previously unreported protein fold. The amino-terminal domain, consisting of TM1-6, forms a horseshoe-shaped structure, surrounding TM7-9 of the carboxy-terminal domain. The two catalytic aspartate residues are located on the cytoplasmic side of TM6 and TM7, spatially close to each other and approximately 8 angstrom into the lipid membrane surface. Water molecules gain constant access to the catalytic aspartates through a large cavity between the amino-and carboxy-terminal domains. Structural analysis reveals insights into the presenilin/SPP family of intramembrane proteases.","[Li, Xiaochun; Dang, Shangyu; Yan, Chuangye; Gong, Xinqi; Shi, Yigong] Tsinghua Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Prot Sci, Sch Life Sci,Ctr Struct Biol, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Li, Xiaochun; Dang, Shangyu; Yan, Chuangye; Gong, Xinqi; Wang, Jiawei; Shi, Yigong] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Med, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Li, Xiaochun; Dang, Shangyu; Yan, Chuangye; Gong, Xinqi; Wang, Jiawei; Shi, Yigong] Tsinghua Univ, Tsinghua Peking Joint Ctr Life Sci, Struct Biol Ctr, Sch Life Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jiawei] Tsinghua Univ, State Key Lab Biomembrane & Membrane Biotechnol, Struct Biol Ctr, Sch Life Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China","Shi, YG (reprint author), Tsinghua Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Prot Sci, Sch Life Sci,Ctr Struct Biol, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",shi-lab@tsinghua.edu.cn,,,Ministry of Science and Technology [2009CB918801]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [30888001],"We thank J.

It has previously been suspected(2) that dwarf galaxies may not be isotropically distributed around our Galaxy, because several are correlated with streams of H I emission, and may form coplanar groups(3). These suspicions are supported by recent analyses(4-7). It has been claimed(7) that the apparently planar distribution of satellites is not predicted within standard cosmology(8), and cannot simply represent a memory of past coherent accretion. However, other studies dispute this conclusion(9-11). Here we report the existence of a planar subgroup of satellites in the Andromeda galaxy (M 31), comprising about half of the population. The structure is at least 400 kiloparsecs in diameter, but also extremely thin, with a perpendicular scatter of less than 14.1 kiloparsecs. Radial velocity measurements(12-15) reveal that the satellites in this structure have the same sense of rotation about their host. This shows conclusively that substantial numbers of dwarf satellite galaxies share the same dynamical orbital properties and direction of angular momentum. Intriguingly, the plane we identify is approximately aligned with the pole of the Milky Way's disk and with the vector between the Milky Way and Andromeda.","[Ibata, Rodrigo A.; Martin, Nicolas F.] Observ Astron, F-67000 Strasbourg, France; [Lewis, Geraint F.] Univ Sydney, Sch Phys, Sydney Inst Astron, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Conn, Anthony R.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia; [Irwin, Michael J.] Univ Cambridge, Inst Astron, Cambridge CB3 0HA, England; [McConnachie, Alan W.] NRC Herzberg Inst Astrophys, Victoria, BC V9E 2E7, Canada; [Chapman, Scott C.] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Phys & Atmospher Sci, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada; [Collins, Michelle L.; Martin, Nicolas F.] Max Planck Inst Astron, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Fardal, Mark] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Astron, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Ferguson, Annette M.

Recent observations have revealed regions of gamma-ray emission reaching far above and below the Galactic Centre (relative to the Galactic plane), the so-called 'Fermi bubbles'(2). It is uncertain whether these were generated by nuclear star formation or by quasar-like outbursts of the central black hole(3-6) and no information on the structures' magnetic field has been reported. Here we report observations of two giant, linearly polarized radio lobes, containing three ridgelike substructures, emanating from the Galactic Centre. The lobes each extend about 60 degrees in the Galactic bulge, closely corresponding to the Fermi bubbles, and are permeated by strong magnetic fields of up to 15 microgauss. We conclude that the radio lobes originate in a biconical, star-formation-driven (rather than black-hole-driven) outflow from the Galaxy's central 200 parsecs that transports a huge amount of magnetic energy, about 10(55) ergs, into the Galactic halo. The ridges wind around this outflow and, we suggest, constitute a 'phonographic' record of nuclear star formation activity over at least ten million years.","[Carretti, Ettore] CSIRO Astron & Space Sci, Parkes, NSW 2870, Australia; [Crocker, Roland M.] Max Planck Inst Kernphys, D-69029 Heidelberg, Germany; [Crocker, Roland M.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Astron & Astrophys, Weston, ACT 2611, Australia; [Staveley-Smith, Lister] Univ Western Australia, Int Ctr Radio Astron Res, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Staveley-Smith, Lister] Univ Western Australia, ARC Ctr Excellence All sky Astrophys CAASTRO, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Haverkorn, Marijke] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Astrophys IMAPP, NL-6500 GL Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Haverkorn, Marijke] Leiden Univ, Leiden Observ, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands; [Purcell, Cormac; Gaensler, B.

All-optical injection of currents through interfering photoexcitation pathways(7-10) or photoconductive switching of terahertz transients(11-16) has made it possible to control electric current on a subpicosecond time-scale in semiconductors.

The extension of such control to optical frequencies calls for wideband materials such as dielectrics, which require strong electric fields to alter their physical properties(1-5). Few-cycle laser pulses permit damage-free exposure of dielectrics to electric fields of several volts per angstrom(6) and significant modifications in their electronic system(6-13). Fields of such strength and temporal confinement can turn a dielectric from an insulating state to a conducting state within the optical period(14). However, to extend electric signal control and processing to light frequencies depends on the feasibility of reversing these effects approximately as fast as they can be induced. Here we study the underlying electron processes with sub-femtosecond solid-state spectroscopy, which reveals the feasibility of manipulating the electronic structure and electric polarizability of a dielectric reversibly with the electric field of light. We irradiate a dielectric (fused silica) with a waveform-controlled near-infrared few-cycle light field of several volts per angstrom and probe changes in extreme-ultraviolet absorptivity and near-infrared reflectivity on a timescale of approximately a hundred attoseconds to a few femtoseconds. The field-induced changes follow, in a highly nonlinear fashion, the turn-on and turn-off behaviour of the driving field, in agreement with the predictions of a quantum mechanical model. The ultrafast reversibility of the effects implies that the physical properties of a dielectric can be controlled with the electric field of light, offering the potential for petahertz-bandwidth signal manipulation.","[Schultze, Martin; Bothschafter, Elisabeth M.; Sommer, Annkatrin; Holzner, Simon; Schweinberger, Wolfgang; Fiess, Markus; Kienberger, Reinhard; Krausz, Ferenc] Max Planck Inst Quantum Opt, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Schultze, Martin; Hofstetter, Michael; Yakovlev, Vladislav S.; Krausz, Ferenc] Univ Munich, Fak Phys, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Bothschafter, Elisabeth M.; Kienberger, Reinhard] Tech Univ Munich, Phys Dept, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Apalkov, Vadym; Stockman, Mark I.] Georgia State Univ, Dept Phys, Atlanta, GA 30340 USA","Schultze, M (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Quantum Opt, Hans Kopfermann Str 1, D-85748 Garching, Germany.",martin.schultze@mpq.mpg.de; mstockman@gsu.edu; krausz@lmu.de,"Bothschafter, Elisabeth/D-4021-2016; Yakovlev, Vladislav/C-4091-2015","Yakovlev, Vladislav/0000-0002-0648-9375","Max Planck Society; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft Cluster of Excellence: Munich Centre for Advanced Photonics; Chemical Sciences, Biosciences and Geosciences Division [DEFG02-01ER15213]; Materials Sciences and Engineering Division of the Office of the Basic Energy Sciences, Office of Science, US Department of Energy [DE-FG02-11ER46789]","This work was supported by the Max Planck Society and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft Cluster of Excellence: Munich Centre for Advanced Photonics (www.munich-photonics.de).

In response, the scientific community has published a number of scenario studies that estimate the costs of achieving such a target(2-5). Producing these estimates remains a challenge, particularly because of relatively well known, but poorly quantified, uncertainties, and owing to limited integration of scientific knowledge across disciplines(6). The integrated assessment community, on the one hand, has extensively assessed the influence of technological and socio-economic uncertainties on low-carbon scenarios and associated costs(2-4,7). The climate modelling community, on the other hand, has spent years improving its understanding of the geophysical response of the Earth system to emissions of greenhouse gases(8-12). This geophysical response remains a key uncertainty in the cost of mitigation scenarios but has been integrated with assessments of other uncertainties in only a rudimentary manner, that is, for equilibrium conditions(6,13). Here we bridge this gap between the two research communities by generating distributions of the costs associated with limiting transient global temperature increase to below specific values, taking into account uncertainties in four factors: geophysical, technological, social and political. Wefind that political choices that delay mitigation have the largest effect on the cost-risk distribution, followed by geophysical uncertainties, social factors influencing future energy demand and, lastly, technological uncertainties surrounding the availability of greenhouse gas mitigation options. Our information on temperature risk and mitigation costs provides crucial information for policy-making, because it clarifies the relative importance of mitigation costs, energy demand and the timing of global action in reducing the risk of exceeding a global temperature increase of 2 degrees C, or other limits such as 3 degrees C or 1.5 degrees C, across a wide range of scenarios.","[Rogelj, Joeri] ETH, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Rogelj, Joeri; McCollum, David L.; Riahi, Keywan] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Reisinger, Andy] New Zealand Agr Greenhouse Gas Res Ctr, Palmerston North 4442, New Zealand; [Meinshausen, Malte] Univ Melbourne, Sch Earth Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Meinshausen, Malte] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, PRIMAP Grp, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Riahi, Keywan] Graz Univ Technol, A-8010 Graz, Austria","Rogelj, J (reprint author), ETH, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Univ Str 16, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",joeri.rogelj@env.ethz.ch,"Meinshausen, Malte/A-7037-2011; Riahi, Keywan/B-6426-2011","Meinshausen, Malte/0000-0003-4048-3521; Riahi, Keywan/0000-0001-7193-3498; Reisinger, Andy/0000-0002-6631-7188; Rogelj, Joeri/0000-0003-2056-9061",Swiss National Science Foundation [200021-135067]; IIASA Peccei Award Grant,"We thank V.

Oxygen fugacities recorded by garnet-bearing peridotite xenoliths from Archaean lithosphere are of particular interest, because they provide constraints on the nature of volatile-bearing metasomatic fluids and melts active in the oldest mantle samples, including those in which diamonds are found(2,3). Here we report the results of experiments to test garnet oxythermobarometry equilibria(4,5) under high-pressure conditions relevant to the deepest mantle xenoliths. We present a formulation for the most successful equilibrium and use it to determine an accurate picture of the oxygen fugacity through cratonic lithosphere. The oxygen fugacity of the deepest rocks is found to be at least one order of magnitude more oxidized than previously estimated. At depths where diamonds can form, the oxygen fugacity is not compatible with the stability of either carbonate-or methane-rich liquid but is instead compatible with a metasomatic liquid poor in carbonate and dominated by either water or silicate melt. The equilibrium also indicates that the relative oxygen fugacity of garnet-bearing rocks will increase with decreasing depth during adiabatic decompression. This implies that carbon in the asthenospheric mantle will be hosted as graphite or diamond but will be oxidized to produce carbonatemelt through the reduction of Fe3+ in silicate minerals during upwelling. The depth of carbonate melt formation will depend on the ratio of Fe3+ to total iron in the bulk rock. This 'redox melting' relationship has important implications for the onset of geophysically detectable incipient melting and for the extraction of carbon dioxide from the mantle through decompressive melting.","[Stagno, Vincenzo; Ojwang, Dickson O.; McCammon, Catherine A.; Frost, Daniel J.] Univ Bayreuth, Bayer Geoinst, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany","Frost, DJ (reprint author), Univ Bayreuth, Bayer Geoinst, POB 101251, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany.",dan.frost@uni-bayreuth.de,"; McCammon, Catherine/B-4983-2010; Frost, Daniel/B-7526-2016","Ojwang, Dickson/0000-0001-9304-8975; McCammon, Catherine/0000-0001-5680-9106; Frost, Daniel/0000-0002-4443-8149; Stagno, Vincenzo/0000-0002-8710-0885",European Commission under the Marie Curie Action for Early Stage Training of Researchers within the 6th Framework Programme [MEST-CT-2005-019700]; German Science Foundation [FR1555/5-1],Financial support was provided to V.

Recent documentation of palaeosols in the Ediacara Member of the Rawnsley Quartzite of South Australia(4) confirms past interpretations of lagoonal-aeolian deposition based on synsedimentary ferruginization and loessic texture(5,6). Further evidence for palaeosols comes from non-marine facies, dilation cracks, soil nodules, sand crystals, stable isotopic data and mass balance geochemistry(4). Here I show that the uppermost surfaces of the palaeosols have a variety of fossils in growth position, including Charniodiscus, Dickinsonia, Hallidaya, Parvancorina, Phyllozoon, Praecambridium, Rugoconites, Tribrachidium and 'old-elephant skin' (ichnogenus Rivularites(7)). These fossils were preserved as ferruginous impressions, like plant fossils(8), and biological soil crusts(9,10) of Phanerozoic eon sandy palaeosols. Sand crystals after gypsum(11) and nodules of carbonate(12) are shallow within the palaeosols(4), even after correcting for burial compaction(13). Periglacial involutions and modest geochemical differentiation of the palaeosols are evidence of a dry, cold temperate Ediacaran palaeoclimate in South Australia(4). This new interpretation of some Ediacaran fossils as large sessile organisms of cool, dry soils, is compatible with observations that Ediacaran fossils were similar in appearance and preservation to lichens and other microbial colonies of biological soil crusts(3), rather than marine animals(1), or protists(2).","Univ Oregon, Dept Geol Sci, Eugene, OR 97403 USA","Retallack, GJ (reprint author), Univ Oregon, Dept Geol Sci, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",gregr@uoregon.edu,,,PRF fund of the American Chemical Society,"K.

Size-signal allometry or acoustic detection constraints imposed on wavelength by preferred prey size have been used to explain this relationship(1,3). Here we propose the hypothesis that smaller bats emit higher frequencies to achieve directional sonar beams, and that variable beam width is critical for bats. Shorter wavelengths relative to the size of the emitter translate into more directional sound beams(4). Therefore, bats that emit their calls through their mouths should show a relationship between mouth size and wavelength, driving smaller bats to signals of higher frequency. We found that in a flight room mimicking a closed habitat, six aerial hawking vespertilionid species (ranging in size from 4 to 21 g, ref. 5) produced sonar beams of extraordinarily similar shape and volume. Each species had a directivity index of 11 +/- 1 dB (a half-amplitude angle of approximately 37 degrees) and an on-axis sound level of 108 +/- 4 dB sound pressure level referenced to 20 mu Pa root mean square at 10 cm. Thus all bats adapted their calls to achieve similar acoustic fields of view. We propose that the necessity for high directionality has been a key constraint on the evolution of echolocation, which explains the relationship between bat size and echolocation call frequency. Our results suggest that echolocation is a dynamic system that allows different species, regardless of their body size, to converge on optimal fields of view in response to habitat and task.","[Jakobsen, Lasse; Ratcliffe, John M.; Surlykke, Annemarie] Univ So Denmark, Sound Commun Grp, Inst Biol, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark","Surlykke, A (reprint author), Univ So Denmark, Sound Commun Grp, Inst Biol, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark.",ams@biology.sdu.dk,,"Jakobsen, Lasse/0000-0002-8496-5576","Danish Council for Natural Sciences (FNU), Carlsberg, Oticon; European Commission via the Seventh Framework Programme project ChiRoPing, Information Society Technologies [215370]","We thank H.

In the visual cortex, in particular, intracellular measurements have related response selectivity to coordinated increases in excitation and inhibition(5-9). These measurements, however, have all been made during anaesthesia, which strongly influences cortical state(10) and therefore sensory processing(7,11-15). The synaptic activity that is evoked by visual stimulation during wakefulness is unknown. Here we measured visually evoked responses-and the underlying synaptic conductances-in the visual cortex of anaesthetized and awake mice. Under anaesthesia, responses could be elicited from a large region of visual space(16) and were prolonged. During wakefulness, responses were more spatially selective and much briefer. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of synaptic conductances(5,17) showed a difference in synaptic inhibition between the two conditions. Under anaesthesia, inhibition tracked excitation in amplitude and spatial selectivity. By contrast, during wakefulness, inhibition was much stronger than excitation and had extremely broad spatial selectivity. We conclude that during wakefulness, cortical responses to visual stimulation are dominated by synaptic inhibition, restricting the spatial spread and temporal persistence of neural activity. These results provide a direct glimpse of synaptic mechanisms that control sensory responses in the awake cortex.","[Haider, Bilal; Carandini, Matteo] UCL, UCL Inst Ophthalmol, London EC1V 9EL, England; [Haeusser, Michael] UCL, Wolfson Inst Biomed Res, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Haeusser, Michael] UCL, Dept Neurosci Physiol & Pharmacol, London WC1E 6BT, England","Haider, B (reprint author), UCL, UCL Inst Ophthalmol, 11-43 Bath St, London EC1V 9EL, England.",b.haider@ucl.ac.uk,,"Carandini, Matteo/0000-0003-4880-7682",National Science Foundation; European Research Council; Wellcome Trust; Medical Research Council; Gatsby Charitable Foundation,"We thank T.

A notable example occurs during vertebrate segment formation: after experimental reduction of embryo size, segments form proportionally smaller, and consequently, a normal number of segments is formed(1,7,8). Despite decades of experimental(1,7) and theoretical work(9-11), the underlying mechanism remains unknown. More recently, ultradian oscillations in gene activity have been linked to the temporal control of segmentation(12); however, their implication in scaling remains elusive. Here we show that scaling of gene oscillation dynamics underlies segment scaling. To this end, we develop a new experimental model, an ex vivo primary cell culture assay that recapitulates mouse mesoderm patterning and segment scaling, in a quasi-monolayer of presomitic mesoderm cells (hereafter termed monolayer PSM or mPSM). Combined with real-time imaging of gene activity, this enabled us to quantify the gradual shift in the oscillation phase and thus determine the resulting phase gradient across the mPSM. Crucially, we show that this phase gradient scales by maintaining a fixed amplitude across mPSM of different lengths. We identify the slope of this phase gradient as a single predictive parameter for segment size, which functions in a size-and temperature-independent manner, revealing a hitherto unrecognized mechanism for scaling. Notably, in contrast to molecular gradients, a phase gradient describes the distribution of a dynamical cellular state. Thus, our phase-gradient scaling findings reveal a new level of dynamic information-processing, and provide evidence for the concept of phase-gradient encoding during embryonic patterning and scaling.","[Lauschke, Volker M.; Tsiairis, Charisios D.; Aulehla, Alexander] European Mol Biol Lab, Dev Biol Unit, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Francois, Paul] McGill Univ, Dept Phys, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T8, Canada","Aulehla, A (reprint author), European Mol Biol Lab, Dev Biol Unit, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany.",aulehla@embl.de,"Lauschke, Volker/O-3014-2017","Lauschke, Volker/0000-0002-1140-6204; Tsiairis, Charisios/0000-0002-9788-9875; Francois, Paul/0000-0002-2223-839X",Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [RGPIN 401950-11]; Regroupement Quebecois pour les materiaux de pointe (RQMP); McGill University,"We thank members of the Aulehla laboratory for discussion and comments on the manuscript.

The Wnt signalling pathway is the major driving force for homeostatic self-renewal and regeneration in the mammalian intestine. However, the mechanisms that counterbalance Wnt-driven proliferation are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate in mice and humans that yes-associated protein 1 (YAP; also known as YAP1)-a protein known for its powerful growth-inducing and oncogenic properties(1,2)-has an unexpected growth-suppressive function, restricting Wnt signals during intestinal regeneration. Transgenic expression of YAP reduces Wnt target gene expression and results in the rapid loss of intestinal crypts. In addition, loss of YAP results in Wnt hypersensitivity during regeneration, leading to hyperplasia, expansion of intestinal stem cells and niche cells, and formation of ectopic crypts and microadenomas. We find that cytoplasmic YAP restricts elevated Wnt signalling independently of the AXIN-APC-GSK-3 beta complex partly by limiting the activity of dishevelled (DVL). DVL signals in the nucleus of intestinal stem cells, and its forced expression leads to enhanced Wnt signalling in crypts. YAP dampens Wnt signals by restricting DVL nuclear translocation during regenerative growth. Finally, we provide evidence that YAP is silenced in a subset of highly aggressive and undifferentiated human colorectal carcinomas, and that its expression can restrict the growth of colorectal carcinoma xenografts. Collectively, our work describes a novel mechanistic paradigm for how proliferative signals are counterbalanced in regenerating tissues. Additionally, our findings have important implications for the targeting of YAP in human malignancies.","[Barry, Evan R.; Butler, Brian L.; Shrestha, Kriti; de la Rosa, Rosemarie; Camargo, Fernando D.] Childrens Hosp, Stem Cell Program, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Barry, Evan R.; Butler, Brian L.; Shrestha, Kriti; de la Rosa, Rosemarie; Camargo, Fernando D.] Childrens Hosp, Dept Hematol Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Barry, Evan R.; Butler, Brian L.; Camargo, Fernando D.] Harvard Univ, Dept Stem Cell & Regenerat Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Barry, Evan R.; Camargo, Fernando D.] Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Morikawa, Teppei; Fuchs, Charles S.; Ogino, Shuji] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Morikawa, Teppei; Fuchs, Charles S.; Ogino, Shuji] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Yan, Kelley S.; Kuo, Calvin J.] Stanford Univ, Dept Med, Div Hematol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Fuchs, Charles S.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Channing Lab, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Fuchs, Charles S.; Ogino, Shuji] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Magness, Scott T.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Med, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Magness, Scott T.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biomed Engn, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Smits, Ron] Erasmus MC, Dept Gastroenterol & Hepatol, NL-3000 CA Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Ogino, Shuji] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Camargo, FD (reprint author), Childrens Hosp, Stem Cell Program, 300 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",Fernando.camargo@childrens.harvard.edu,,,"Stand Up to Cancer-AACR initiative; National Institutes of Health [R01 CA131426, AR064036]; Harvard Stem Cell Institute; American Cancer Society Illinois Division [PF-12-245-01-CCG]; CIRM [1K08DK096048];  [1U01DK085527];  [R01 CA151993];  [R01 DK091427];  [P01CA87969];  [P50CA127003]","We thank L.

However, the regulatory mechanism of these interactions is largely unknown. Here we show that Ca2+ can bind directly to anionic phospholipids and thus modulate membrane protein function. The activation of T-cell antigen receptor-CD3 complex (TCR), a key membrane receptor for adaptive immunity, is regulated by ionic interactions between positively charged CD3 epsilon/zeta cytoplasmic domains (CD3(CD)) and negatively charged phospholipids in the plasma membrane(1,8-10). Crucial tyrosines are buried in the membrane and are largely protected from phosphorylation in resting T cells. It is not clear how CD3CD dissociates from the membrane in antigen-stimulated T cells. The antigen engagement of even a single TCR triggers a Ca2+ influx(11) and TCR-proximal Ca2+ concentration is higher than the average cytosolic Ca2+ concentration(12). Our biochemical, live-cell fluorescence resonance energy transfer and NMR experiments showed that an increase in Ca2+ concentration induced the dissociation of CD3CD from the membrane and the solvent exposure of tyrosine residues. As a consequence, CD3 tyrosine phosphorylation was significantly enhanced by Ca2+ influx. Moreover, when compared with wild-type cells, Ca2+ channel-deficient T cells had substantially lower levels of CD3 phosphorylation after stimulation. The effect of Ca2+ on facilitating CD3 phosphorylation is primarily due to the charge of this ion, as demonstrated by the fact that replacing Ca2+ with the non-physiological ion Sr2+ resulted in the same feedback effect. Finally, P-31 NMR spectroscopy showed that Ca2+ bound to the phosphate group in anionic phospholipids at physiological concentrations, thus neutralizing the negative charge of phospholipids. Rather than initiating CD3 phosphorylation, this regulatory pathway of Ca2+ has a positive feedback effect on amplifying and sustaining CD3 phosphorylation and should enhance T-cell sensitivity to foreign antigens. Our study thus provides a new regulatory mechanism of Ca2+ to T-cell activation involving direct lipid manipulation.","[Bi, Yunchen; Wan, Chanjuan; Wang, Yujuan; Wu, Bo; Sun, Hongbin; Wang, Junfeng] Chinese Acad Sci, High Magnet Field Lab, Hefei Inst Phys Sci, Hefei 230031, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Shi, Xiaoshan; Yang, Wei; Guo, Xingdong; Jiang, Yan; Li, Lunyi; Bai, Yibing; Guo, Jun; Xu, Chenqi] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Mol Biol, Inst Biochem & Cell Biol, Shanghai Inst Biol Sci, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China; [Shi, Xiaoshan; Yang, Wei; Guo, Xingdong; Jiang, Yan; Li, Lunyi; Bai, Yibing; Guo, Jun; Xu, Chenqi] Chinese Acad Sci, Natl Ctr Prot Sci, Inst Biochem & Cell Biol, Shanghai Inst Biol Sci, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China; [Chen, Xiangjun; Liu, Wanli] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Life Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China","Wang, JF (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, High Magnet Field Lab, Hefei Inst Phys Sci, 350 Shushanhu Rd, Hefei 230031, Anhui, Peoples R China.",junfeng@hmfl.ac.cn; cqxu@sibcb.ac.cn,"liu, wanli/H-5690-2011; Sun, Hongbin/C-9721-2015","liu, wanli/0000-0003-2624-6802; Sun, Hongbin/0000-0002-7712-0655; Xu, Chenqi/0000-0002-4968-6782; Yang, Wei/0000-0001-9438-7215","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) [2011CB910901, 2012CB910804, 2012CB917202]; National Science Foundation of China [31070738]; Chinese Academy of Sciences [KSCX2-EW-J-11]; Shanghai Municipal Commission for Science and Technology [10PJ1411500]; Young Talent Program of Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, CAS [2010KIP101]","We would like to thank R.

Dealing with high levels of transcription during replication is critical to prevent collisions between the transcription and replication pathways and avoid recombination events(3-5). In response to osmostress, hundreds of stress-responsive genes are rapidly induced by the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) Hog1 (ref.6), even during S phase(7). Here we show in Saccharomyces cerevisae that a single signalling molecule, Hog1, coordinates both replication and transcription upon osmostress. Hog1 interacts with and phosphorylates Mrc1, a component of the replication complex(8-11). Phosphorylation occurs at different sites to those targeted by Mec1 upon DNA damage(8,9). Mrc1 phosphorylation by Hog1 delays early and late origin firing by preventing Cdc45 loading, as well as slowing down replication-complex progression. Regulation of Mrc1 by Hog1 is completely independent of Mec1 and Rad53. Cells carrying a non-phosphorylatable allele of MRC1 (mrc1(3A)) do not delay replication upon stress and show a marked increase in transcription-associated recombination, genomic instability and Rad52 foci. In contrast, mrc1(3A) induces Rad53 and survival in the presence of hydroxyurea or methyl methanesulphonate. Therefore, Hog1 and Mrc1 define a novel S-phase checkpoint independent of the DNA-damage checkpoint that permits eukaryotic cells to prevent conflicts between DNA replication and transcription, which would otherwise lead to genomic instability when both phenomena are temporally coincident.","[Duch, Alba; Yaakov, Gilad; de Nadal, Eulalia; Posas, Francesc] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Cell Signaling Unit, Dept Ciencies Expt & Salut, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain; [Felipe-Abrio, Irene; Barroso, Sonia; Garcia-Rubio, Maria; Aguilera, Andres] Univ Seville, Ctr Andaluz Biol Mol & Med Regenerat CABIMER, Seville 41092, Spain","Posas, F (reprint author), Univ Pompeu Fabra, Cell Signaling Unit, Dept Ciencies Expt & Salut, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain.",francesc.posas@upf.edu,"; Posas, Francesc/K-1364-2013; de Nadal, Eulalia/J-8178-2014; Barroso, Sonia/F-2288-2016; Garcia-Rubio, Maria/C-2061-2017","Aguilera, Andres/0000-0003-4782-1714; Posas, Francesc/0000-0002-4164-7076; de Nadal, Eulalia/0000-0003-0039-5607; Barroso, Sonia/0000-0002-0062-2016; Garcia-Rubio, Maria/0000-0003-0981-0555; Duch, Alba/0000-0001-6041-1360","Spanish Government [BIO2009-07762, BFU2012-33503, BFU2011-26722, BFU2010-16372, CSD2007-0015]; FP7 UNICELLSYS grant [201142]; Fundacion Marcelino Botin; ICREA Academia (Generalitat de Catalunya)","We thank L.

Because hyperactivated DDC signalling can lead to a persistent and detrimental cell-cycle arrest(2,3), cells must tightly regulate the activity of the kinases involved in this pathway. Despite their importance, the mechanisms for monitoring and modulating DDC signalling are not fully understood. Here we show that the DNA-repair scaffolding proteins Slx4 and Rtt107 prevent the aberrant hyperactivation of DDC signalling by lesions that are generated during DNA replication in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. On replication stress, cells lacking Slx4 or Rtt107 show hyperactivation of the downstream DDC kinase Rad53, whereas activation of the upstream DDC kinase Mec1 remains normal. An Slx4-Rtt107 complex counteracts the checkpoint adaptor Rad9 by physically interacting with Dpb11 and phosphorylated histone H2A, two positive regulators of Rad9-dependent Rad53 activation. A decrease in DDC signalling results from hypomorphic mutations in RAD53 and H2A and rescues the hypersensitivity to replication stress of cells lacking Slx4 or Rtt107. We propose that the Slx4-Rtt107 complex modulates Rad53 activation by a competition-based mechanism that balances the engagement of Rad9 at replication-induced lesions. Our findings show that DDC signalling is monitored and modulated through the direct action of DNA-repair factors.","[Ohouo, Patrice Y.; de Oliveira, Francisco M.

To understand further the genetic factors influencing red blood cells, we carried out a genome-wide association study of haemoglobin concentration and related parameters in up to 135,367 individuals. Here we identify 75 independent genetic loci associated with one or more red blood cell phenotypes at P < 10(-8), which together explain 4-9% of the phenotypic variance per trait. Using expression quantitative trait loci and bioinformatic strategies, we identify 121 candidate genes enriched in functions relevant to red blood cell biology. The candidate genes are expressed preferentially in red blood cell precursors, and 43 have haematopoietic phenotypes in Mus musculus or Drosophila melanogaster. Through open-chromatin and coding-variant analyses we identify potential causal genetic variants at 41 loci. Our findings provide extensive new insights into genetic mechanisms and biological pathways controlling red blood cell formation and function.","[Zhang, Weihua; Al-Hussani, Abtehale; O'Reilly, Paul F.; Elliott, Paul; Jarvelin, Marjo-Riitta; Chambers, John C.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, London W2 1PG, England; [van der Harst, Pim; Leach, Irene Mateo; Verweij, Niek; de Boer, Rudolf A.; Sillje, Herman H.

Shortly after birth, however, cardiomyocytes stop proliferating and further growth of the myocardium occurs through hypertrophic enlargement of the existing myocytes. As a consequence of the minimal renewal of cardiomyocytes during adult life, repair of cardiac damage through myocardial regeneration is very limited. Here we show that the exogenous administration of selected microRNAs (miRNAs) markedly stimulates cardiomyocyte proliferation and promotes cardiac repair. We performed a high-content microscopy, high-throughput functional screening for human miRNAs that promoted neonatal cardiomyocyte proliferation using a whole-genome miRNA library. Forty miRNAs strongly increased both DNA synthesis and cytokinesis in neonatal mouse and rat cardiomyocytes. Two of these miRNAs (hsa-miR-590 and hsa-miR-199a) were further selected for testing and were shown to promote cell cycle re-entry of adult cardiomyocytes ex vivo and to promote cardiomyocyte proliferation in both neonatal and adult animals. After myocardial infarction in mice, these miRNAs stimulated marked cardiac regeneration and almost complete recovery of cardiac functional parameters. The miRNAs identified hold great promise for the treatment of cardiac pathologies consequent to cardiomyocyte loss.","[Eulalio, Ana; Mano, Miguel; Dal Ferro, Matteo; Zentilin, Lorena; Zacchigna, Serena; Giacca, Mauro] ICGEB, Mol Med Lab, I-34149 Trieste, Italy; [Dal Ferro, Matteo; Sinagra, Gianfranco] Univ Trieste, Dept Med Surg & Hlth Sci, Trieste, Italy; [Dal Ferro, Matteo; Sinagra, Gianfranco] Azienda Osped Univ Osped Riuniti Trieste, Ctr Translat Cardiol, I-34129 Trieste, Italy","Giacca, M (reprint author), ICGEB, Mol Med Lab, I-34149 Trieste, Italy.",giacca@icgeb.org,"Mano, Miguel/A-4462-2013; Eulalio, Ana/D-3083-2013; Giacca, Mauro/J-9287-2016","Mano, Miguel/0000-0003-1922-4824; Eulalio, Ana/0000-0002-7355-0674; Giacca, Mauro/0000-0003-2927-7225; SINAGRA, GIANFRANCO/0000-0003-2700-8478","FEBS Long Term Fellowship; European Research Council (ERC) [250124]; Project CTC from the Fondazione CRTrieste, Trieste, Italy","The authors are grateful to M.

FXS is also a prominent monogenic disease associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). FXS is typically caused by the loss of fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) expression, which codes for the RNA-binding protein FMRP. Here we report the discovery of distinct RNA-recognition elements that correspond to the two independent RNA-binding domains of FMRP, in addition to the binding sites within the messenger RNA targets for wild-type and I304N mutant FMRP isoforms and the FMRP paralogues FXR1P and FXR2P (also known as FXR1 and FXR2). RNA-recognition-element frequency, ratio and distribution determine target mRNA association with FMRP. Among highly enriched targets, we identify many genes involved in ASD and show that FMRP affects their protein levels in human cell culture, mouse ovaries and human brain. Notably, we discovered that these targets are also dysregulated in Fmr1(-/-) mouse ovaries showing signs of premature follicular overdevelopment. These results indicate that FMRP targets share signalling pathways across different cellular contexts.

Thrombin irreversibly activates PAR1 by cleaving the amino-terminal exodomain of the receptor, which exposes a tethered peptide ligand that binds the heptahelical bundle of the receptor to affect G-protein activation. Here we report the 2.2 angstrom resolution crystal structure of human PAR1 bound to vorapaxar, a PAR1 antagonist. The structure reveals an unusual mode of drug binding that explains how a small molecule binds virtually irreversibly to inhibit receptor activation by the tethered ligand of PAR1. In contrast to deep, solvent-exposed binding pockets observed in other peptide-activated G-protein-coupled receptors, the vorapaxar-binding pocket is superficial but has little surface exposed to the aqueous solvent. Protease-activated receptors are important targets for drug development.

Therefore clusters with the same chronological age may have reached quite different stages of their dynamical history (that is, they may have different 'dynamical ages'). Blue straggler stars have masses greater(2) than those at the turn-off point on the main sequence and therefore must be the result of either a collision(3,4) or a mass-transfer event(5-7). Because they are among the most massive and luminous objects in old clusters, they can be used as test particles with which to probe dynamical evolution. Here we report that globular clusters can be grouped into a few distinct families on the basis of the radial distribution of blue stragglers. This grouping corresponds well to an effective ranking of the dynamical stage reached by stellar systems, thereby permitting a direct measure of the cluster dynamical age purely from observed properties.","[Ferraro, F.

More recently, substantial progress has been made in the production of cold molecular gases(5). Their permanent electric dipole moment is expected to generate systems with varied and controllable phases(6-8), dynamics(9-11) and chemistry(12-14). However, although advances have been made(15) in both direct cooling and cold-association techniques, evaporative cooling has not been achieved so far. This is due to unfavourable ratios of elastic to inelastic scattering(13) and impractically slow thermalization rates in the available trapped species. Here we report the observation of microwave-forced evaporative cooling of neutral hydroxyl (OH center dot) molecules loaded from a Stark-decelerated beam into an extremely high-gradient magnetic quadrupole trap. We demonstrate cooling by at least one order of magnitude in temperature, and a corresponding increase in phase-space density by three orders of magnitude, limited only by the low-temperature sensitivity of our spectroscopic thermometry technique. With evaporative cooling and a sufficiently large initial population, much colder temperatures are possible; even a quantum-degenerate gas of this dipolar radical (or anything else it can sympathetically cool) may be within reach.","[Stuhl, Benjamin K.; Hummon, Matthew T.; Yeo, Mark; Quemener, Goulven; Bohn, John L.; Ye, Jun] Univ Colorado, NIST, Joint Inst Lab Astrophys, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Stuhl, Benjamin K.; Hummon, Matthew T.; Yeo, Mark; Quemener, Goulven; Bohn, John L.; Ye, Jun] Univ Colorado, Dept Phys, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","Ye, J (reprint author), Univ Colorado, NIST, Joint Inst Lab Astrophys, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",ye@jila.colorado.edu,"Ye, Jun/C-3312-2011","Stuhl, Benjamin/0000-0003-0759-3323; HUMMON, MATTHEW/0000-0002-3020-0500",NSF Physics Frontier Center; DOE; AFOSR (MURI); DARPA; NIST,"We thank E.

In 1965, Maki and Griffin predicted(3) that the thermal current through a temperature-biased Josephson tunnel junction coupling two superconductors should be a stationary periodic function of the quantum phase difference between the superconductors: a temperature-biased SQUID should therefore allow heat currents to interfere(4,5), resulting in a thermal version of the electric Josephson interferometer. This phase-dependent mechanism of thermal transport has been the subject of much discussion(4,6-8) but, surprisingly, has yet to be realized experimentally. Here we investigate heat exchange between two normal metal electrodes kept at different temperatures and tunnel-coupled to each other through a thermal 'modulator' (ref. 5) in the form of a direct-current SQUID. We find that heat transport in the system is phase dependent, in agreement with the original prediction. Our Josephson heat interferometer yields magnetic-flux-dependent temperature oscillations of up to 21 millikelvin in amplitude, and provides a flux-to-temperature transfer coefficient exceeding 60 millikelvin per flux quantum at 235 millikelvin. In addition to confirming the existence of a phase-dependent thermal current unique to Josephson junctions, our results point the way towards the phase-coherent manipulation of heat in solid-state nanocircuits.","[Giazotto, Francesco; Martinez-Perez, Maria Jose] CNR, Ist Nanosci, NEST, I-56127 Pisa, Italy; [Giazotto, Francesco; Martinez-Perez, Maria Jose] Scuola Normale Super Pisa, I-56127 Pisa, Italy","Giazotto, F (reprint author), CNR, Ist Nanosci, NEST, Piazza San Silvestro 12, I-56127 Pisa, Italy.",giazotto@sns.it,"Martinez-Perez, Maria Jose/B-3446-2014","Martinez-Perez, Maria Jose/0000-0002-8125-877X",EC FP7 programme [228464],"We thank F.

Quantum spin liquids cannot be described by the broken symmetries associated with conventional ground states. In fact, the interacting magnetic moments in these systems do not order, but are highly entangled with one another over long ranges(1). Spin liquids have a prominent role in theories describing high-transition-temperature superconductors(2,3), and the topological properties of these states may have applications in quantum information(4). A key feature of spin liquids is that they support exotic spin excitations carrying fractional quantum numbers. However, detailed measurements of these 'fractionalized excitations' have been lacking. Here we report neutron scattering measurements on single-crystal samples of the spin-1/2 kagome-lattice antiferromagnet ZnCu3(OD)(6)Cl-2 (also called herbertsmithite), which provide striking evidence for this characteristic feature of spin liquids. At low temperatures, we find that the spin excitations form a continuum, in contrast to the conventional spin waves expected in ordered antiferromagnets. The observation of such a continuum is noteworthy because, so far, this signature of fractional spin excitations has been observed only in one-dimensional systems. The results also serve as a hallmark of the quantum spin-liquid state in herbertsmithite.","[Han, Tian-Heng; Lee, Young S.] MIT, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Helton, Joel S.; Rodriguez-Rivera, Jose A.; Broholm, Collin] NIST, NIST Ctr Neutron Res, Gaithersburg, MD 20899 USA; [Chu, Shaoyan] MIT, Ctr Mat Sci & Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Nocera, Daniel G.] MIT, Dept Chem, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Rodriguez-Rivera, Jose A.] Univ Maryland, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Broholm, Collin] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Broholm, Collin] Johns Hopkins Univ, Inst Quantum Matter, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA","Lee, YS (reprint author), MIT, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",tianheng@alum.mit.edu; younglee@mit.edu,"Broholm, Collin/E-8228-2011; Rodriguez-Rivera, Jose/A-4872-2013","Broholm, Collin/0000-0002-1569-9892; Rodriguez-Rivera, Jose/0000-0002-8633-8314","US Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-FG02-07ER46134]; US National Science Foundation [DMR-0944772]; DOE, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Division of Material Sciences and Engineering [DE-FG02-08ER46544]","We acknowledge T.

EOT was first attributed to surface plasmon polaritons, stimulating a renewed interest in plasmonics(2-4) and metallic surfaces with subwavelength features(5-7). Experiments soon revealed that the field diffracted at a hole or slit is not a surface plasmon polariton mode alone8. Further theoretical analysis(9) predicted that the extra contribution, from quasi-cylindrical waves(10-13), also affects EOT. Here we report the experimental demonstration of the relative importance of surface plasmon polaritons and quasi-cylindrical waves in EOT by considering hole arrays of different hole densities. From the measured transmission spectra, we determine microscopic scattering parameters which allow us to show that quasi-cylindrical waves affect EOT only for high densities, when the hole spacing is roughly one wavelength.

On the basis of geodynamic simulations, processes significantly affected by viscous anisotropy include post-glacial rebound(1,2), foundering of lithosphere(3) and melt production above subduction zones(4). However, an estimate of the magnitude of viscous anisotropy based on the results of deformation experiments on single crystals(5) differs by three orders of magnitude from that obtained by grain-scale numerical models of deforming aggregates with strong crystallographic alignment(6-8). Complicating matters, recent experiments indicate that deformation of the uppermost mantle is dominated by dislocation-accommodated grain-boundary sliding(9), a mechanism not activated in experiments on single crystals and not included in numerical models. Here, using direct measurements of the viscous anisotropy of highly deformed polycrystalline olivine, we demonstrate a significant directional dependence of viscosity. Specifically, shear viscosities measured in high-strain torsion experiments are 15 times smaller than normal viscosities measured in subsequent tension tests performed parallel to the torsion axis. This anisotropy is approximately an order of magnitude larger than that predicted by grain-scale simulations. These results indicate that dislocation-accommodated grain-boundary sliding produces an appreciable anisotropy in rock viscosity. We propose that crystallographic alignment imparts viscous anisotropy because the rate of deformation is limited by the movement of dislocations through the interiors of the crystallographically aligned grains. The maximum degree of anisotropy is reached at geologically low shear strain (of about ten) such that deforming regions of the upper mantle will exhibit significant viscous anisotropy.","[Hansen, L.

Studies of mathematical(3-5) and experimental(6-9) systems have shown that systems may 'wobble' before a critical transition. Such early warning signals(10) may be due to the phenomenon of critical slowing down, which causes a system to recover slowly from small impacts, or to a flickering phenomenon, which causes a system to switch back and forth between alternative states in response to relatively large impacts. Such signals for transitions in social-ecological systems have rarely been observed(11), not the least because high-resolution time series are normally required. Here we combine empirical data from a lake-catchment system with a mathematical model and show that flickering can be detected from sparse data. We show how rising variance coupled to decreasing autocorrelation and skewness started 10-30 years before the transition to eutrophic lake conditions in both the empirical records and the model output, a finding that is consistent with flickering rather than critical slowing down(4,12). Our results suggest that if environmental regimes are sufficiently affected by large external impacts that flickering is induced, then early warning signals of transitions in modern social-ecological systems may be stronger, and hence easier to identify, than previously thought.","[Wang, Rong; Dearing, John A.; Langdon, Peter G.] Univ Southampton, Palaeoecol Lab, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Wang, Rong; Zhang, Enlou; Yang, Xiangdong] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, State Key Lab Lake Sci & Environm, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Dakos, Vasilis; Scheffer, Marten] Wageningen Univ, Dept Aquat Ecol & Water Qual Management, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Dakos, Vasilis] CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Integrat Ecol Grp, E-41092 Seville, Spain","Dearing, JA (reprint author), Univ Southampton, Palaeoecol Lab, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",j.dearing@soton.ac.uk,"; Langdon, Peter/B-4682-2013; Dearing, John/E-4206-2010; CSIC, EBD Donana/C-4157-2011","Langdon, Peter/0000-0003-2724-2643; Dakos, Vasilis/0000-0001-8862-718X; CSIC, EBD Donana/0000-0003-4318-6602",UK Overseas Research Students Awards; Great Britain-China Educational Trust; University of Southampton; National Basic Research Program of China (973 program) [2012CB956104]; NWO-Rubicon; EU Marie Curie fellowship; Spinoza (NWO) Award; European Research Council,"A studentship to R.W. was funded through the UK Overseas Research Students Awards Scheme, the Great Britain-China Educational Trust and the University of Southampton.

Here we show that an abrupt five-to sixfold ploidy increase approximately 60 million years (Myr) ago, and allopolyploidy reuniting divergent Gossypium genomes approximately 1-2 Myr ago(2), conferred about 30-36-fold duplication of ancestral angiosperm (flowering plant) genes in elite cottons (Gossypium hirsutum and Gossypium barbadense), genetic complexity equalled only by Brassica(3) among sequenced angiosperms. Nascent fibre evolution, before allopolyploidy, is elucidated by comparison of spinnable-fibred Gossypium herbaceum A and non-spinnable Gossypium longicalyx F genomes to one another and the outgroup D genome of non-spinnable Gossypium raimondii. The sequence of a G. hirsutum A(t)D(t) (in which 't' indicates tetraploid) cultivar reveals many non-reciprocal DNA exchanges between subgenomes that may have contributed to phenotypic innovation and/or other emergent properties such as ecological adaptation by polyploids. Most DNA-level novelty in G. hirsutum recombines alleles from the D-genome progenitor native to its New World habitat and the Old World A-genome progenitor in which spinnable fibre evolved. Coordinated expression changes in proximal groups of functionally distinct genes, including a nuclear mitochondrial DNA block, may account for clusters of cotton-fibre quantitative trait loci affecting diverse traits. Opportunities abound for dissecting emergent properties of other polyploids, particularly angiosperms, by comparison to diploid progenitors and outgroups.","[Paterson, Andrew H.; Guo, Hui; Lee, Tae-ho; Li, Jingping; Lin, Lifeng; Marler, Barry S.; Tan, Xu; Tang, Haibao; Wang, Zining; Zhang, Dong; Bowers, John E.; Das, Sayan; Gingle, Alan R.; Lemke, Cornelia; Mansoor, Shahid; Rainville, Lisa N.; Rong, Jun-kang; Wang, Xiyin] Univ Georgia, Plant Genome Mapping Lab, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Wendel, Jonathan F.; Yoo, Mi-jeong; Gong, Lei; Grover, Corrinne; Grupp, Kara; Hu, Guanjing; Szadkowski, Emmanuel; Xu, Chunming] Iowa State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Gundlach, Heidrun; Mayer, Klaus F.

Considering the opposite valence of these two phenotypes as well as the broad complexity of other tasks attributed to PFC, we sought to elucidate the PFC circuitry that favours effortful behavioural responses to challenging situations. Here we develop and use a quantitative method for the continuous assessment and control of active response to a behavioural challenge, synchronized with single-unit electrophysiology and optogenetics in freely moving rats. In recording from the medial PFC (mPFC), we observed that many neurons were not simply movement-related in their spike-firing patterns but instead were selectively modulated from moment to moment, according to the animal's decision to act in a challenging situation. Surprisingly, we next found that direct activation of principal neurons in the mPFC had no detectable causal effect on this behaviour. We tested whether this behaviour could be causally mediated by only a subclass of mPFC cells defined by specific downstream wiring. Indeed, by leveraging optogenetic projection-targeting to control cells with specific efferent wiring patterns, we found that selective activation of those mPFC cells projecting to the brainstem dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), a serotonergic nucleus implicated in major depressive disorder(4), induced a profound, rapid and reversible effect on selection of the active behavioural state. These results may be of importance in understanding the neural circuitry underlying normal and pathological patterns of action selection and motivation in behaviour.","[Warden, Melissa R.; Selimbeyoglu, Aslihan; Mirzabekov, Julie J.; Thompson, Kimberly R.; Kim, Sung-Yon; Adhikari, Avishek; Tye, Kay M.; Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Dept Bioengn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Selimbeyoglu, Aslihan; Kim, Sung-Yon; Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Neurosci Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lo, Maisie] Stanford Univ, Bio X Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Tye, Kay M.] MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Picower Inst Learning & Memory, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Frank, Loren M.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Physiol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Frank, Loren M.] Univ Calif San Francisco, WM Keck Ctr Integrat Neurosci, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, CNC Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Warden, MR (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Bioengn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",mwarden@stanford.edu; deissero@stanford.edu,"Tye, Kay/J-6158-2013; Adhikari, Avishek/A-3339-2012; Adhikari, Avishek/N-1284-2015; Warden, Melissa/M-9300-2016","Tye, Kay/0000-0002-2435-0182; Adhikari, Avishek/0000-0002-9187-9211; Adhikari, Avishek/0000-0002-9187-9211; Warden, Melissa/0000-0003-2240-3997; Kim, Sung-Yon/0000-0003-0791-7308; Frank, Loren/0000-0002-1752-5677",Wiegers Family Fund; NARSAD; Stanford Graduate Fellowship; Samsung Scholarship; Berry Foundation Fellowship; NIMH [1F32MH088010-01]; NIMH; NIDA; DARPA REPAIR Program; Keck Foundation; McKnight Foundation; Yu Foundation; Snyder Foundation; Tarlton Foundation; Alice Woo Foundation; Gatsby Charitable Foundation,"We would like to thank H.

However, only recently has dopamine been linked to motivated behaviour and rewarding reinforcement in fruitflies(3,4). Instead, octopamine has historically been considered to be the signal for reward in insects(5-7). Here we show, using temporal control of neural function in Drosophila, that only short-term appetitive memory is reinforced by octopamine. Moreover, octopamine-dependent memory formation requires signalling through dopamine neurons. Part of the octopamine signal requires the alpha-adrenergic-like OAMB receptor in an identified subset of mushroom-body-targeted dopamine neurons. Octopamine triggers an increase in intracellular calcium in these dopamine neurons, and their direct activation can substitute for sugar to form appetitive memory, even in flies lacking octopamine. Analysis of the beta-adrenergic-like OCT beta 2R receptor reveals that octopamine-dependent reinforcement also requires an interaction with dopamine neurons that control appetitive motivation.

To explore this issue, here we performa whole-genome and transcriptome analysis of 20 human iPSC lines derived from the primary skin fibroblasts of seven individuals using next-generation sequencing. We find that, on average, an iPSC line manifests two copy number variants (CNVs) not apparent in the fibroblasts from which the iPSC was derived. Using PCR and digital droplet PCR, we show that at least 50% of those CNVs are present as low-frequency somatic genomic variants in parental fibroblasts (that is, the fibroblasts from which each corresponding human iPSC line is derived), and are manifested in iPSC lines owing to their clonal origin. Hence, reprogramming does not necessarily lead to de novo CNVs in iPSCs, because most of the line-manifested CNVs reflect somatic mosaicism in the human skin. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that clonal expansion, and iPSC lines in particular, can be used as a discovery tool to reliably detect low-frequency CNVs in the tissue of origin. Overall, we estimate that approximately 30% of the fibroblast cells have somatic CNVs in their genomes, suggesting widespread somatic mosaicism in the human body. Our study paves the way to understanding the fundamental question of the extent to which cells of the human body normally acquire structural alterations in their DNA post-zygotically.","[Abyzov, Alexej; Mariani, Jessica; Palejev, Dean; Zhang, Ying; Tomasini, Livia; Ferrandino, Anthony F.; Belmaker, Lior A.

Before the initiation of meiosis, mouse primordial germ cells undergo a series of epigenetic reprogramming steps(2,3), including the global erasure of DNA methylation at the 5-position of cytosine (5mC) in CpG-rich DNA(4,5). Although several epigenetic regulators, such as Dnmt3l and the histone methyltransferases G9a and Prdm9, have been reported to be crucial for meiosis(6), little is known about how the expression of meiotic genes is regulated and how their expression contributes to normal meiosis. Using a loss-of-function approach in mice, here we show that the 5mC-specific dioxygenase Tet1 has an important role in regulating meiosis in mouse oocytes. Tet1 deficiency significantly reduces female germ-cell numbers and fertility. Univalent chromosomes and unresolved DNA double-strand breaks are also observed in Tet1-deficient oocytes. Tet1 deficiency does not greatly affect the genome-wide demethylation that takes place in primordial germ cells, but leads to defective DNA demethylation and decreased expression of a subset of meiotic genes. Our study thus establishes a function for Tet1 in meiosis and meiotic gene activation in female germ cells.","[Liu, Rui; Diep, Dinh; Zhang, Kun] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Bioengn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Yamaguchi, Shinpei; Hong, Kwonho; Shen, Li; Inoue, Azusa; Zhang, Yi] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Yamaguchi, Shinpei; Hong, Kwonho; Shen, Li; Inoue, Azusa; Zhang, Yi] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston Childrens Hosp, Program Cellular & Mol Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Yamaguchi, Shinpei; Hong, Kwonho; Shen, Li; Inoue, Azusa; Zhang, Yi] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Zhang, Yi] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Zhang, K (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Bioengn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",kzhang@bioeng.ucsd.edu; yzhang@genetics.med.harvard.edu,,"Yamaguchi, Shinpei/0000-0002-9377-4835",National Institutes of Health [U01DK089565]; CIRM [BRB3-05083];  [R01GM097253],"We thank J.

Mediator connects transcriptional regulators and Pol II, and is linked to human disease(1-4). Mediator from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has a molecular mass of 1.4 megadaltons and comprises 25 subunits that form the head, middle, tail and kinase modules(5-7). The head module constitutes one-half of the essential Mediator core(8), and comprises the conserved(9) subunits Med6, Med8, Med11, Med17, Med18, Med20 and Med22. Recent X-ray analysis of the S. cerevisiae head module at 4.3 angstrom resolution led to a partial architectural model with three submodules called neck, fixed jaw and moveable jaw(10). Here we determine de novo the crystal structure of the head module from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe at 3.4 angstrom resolution. Structure solution was enabled by new structures of Med6 and the fixed jaw, and previous structures of the moveable jaw(11) and part of the neck(12), and required deletion of Med20. The S. pombe head module resembles the head of a crocodile with eight distinct elements, of which at least four are mobile. The fixed jaw comprises tooth and nose domains, whereas the neck submodule contains a helical spine and one limb, with shoulder, arm and finger elements. The arm and the essential shoulder contact other parts of Mediator. The jaws and a central joint are implicated in interactions with Pol II and its carboxy-terminal domain, and the joint is required for transcription in vitro. The S. pombe head module structure leads to a revised model of the S. cerevisiae module, reveals a high conservation and flexibility, explains knownmutations, and provides the basis for unravelling a central mechanism of gene regulation.","[Lariviere, Laurent; Plaschka, Clemens; Seizl, Martin; Wenzeck, Larissa; Kurth, Fabian; Cramer, Patrick] Univ Munich, Gene Ctr, D-81377 Munich, Germany; [Lariviere, Laurent; Plaschka, Clemens; Seizl, Martin; Wenzeck, Larissa; Kurth, Fabian; Cramer, Patrick] Univ Munich, CIPSM, Dept Biochem, D-81377 Munich, Germany","Lariviere, L (reprint author), Univ Munich, Gene Ctr, Feodor Lynen Str 25, D-81377 Munich, Germany.",larivier@genzentrum.lmu.de; cramer@genzentrum.lmu.de,,,"Boehringer Ingelheim fellowship; Elite Network of Bavaria; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB646, TR5, GraKo1721, SFB960]; CIPSM; NIM; European Research Council; LMU innovativ project Bioimaging Network; Vallee Foundation; Jung-Stiftung","We thank S.

The task of signalling such events, both rewarding and aversive, from the VTA to the NAc has largely been ascribed to dopamine neurons(1-3). The VTA also contains GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid)-releasing neurons, which provide local inhibition(4,5) and also project to the NAc6,7. However, the cellular targets and functional importance of this long-range inhibitory projection have not been ascertained. Here we show that GABA-releasing neurons of the VTA that project to the NAc (VTA GABA projection neurons) inhibit accumbal cholinergic interneurons (CINs) to enhance stimulus-outcome learning. Combining optogenetics with structural imaging and electrophysiology, we found that VTA GABA projection neurons selectively target NAc CINs, forming multiple symmetrical synaptic contacts that generated inhibitory postsynaptic currents. This is remarkable considering that CINs represent a very small population of all accumbal neurons, and provide the primary source of cholinergic tone in the NAc. Brief activation of this projection was sufficient to halt the spontaneous activity of NAc CINs, resembling the pause recorded in animals learning stimulus-outcome associations(8-12). Indeed, we found that forcing CINs to pause in behaving mice enhanced discrimination of a motivationally important stimulus that had been associated with an aversive outcome. Our results demonstrate that VTA GABA projection neurons, through their selective targeting of accumbal CINs, provide a novel route through which the VTA communicates saliency to the NAc. VTA GABA projection neurons thus emerge as orchestrators of dopaminergic and cholinergic modulation in the NAc.","[Brown, Matthew T.

In particular, death ligands such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha activate necrosis by stimulating the formation of a complex containing receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) and receptor-interacting protein 3 (RIP3). Relatively little is known regarding how this complex formation is regulated. Here, we show that the NAD-dependent deacetylase SIRT2 binds constitutively to RIP3 and that deletion or knockdown of SIRT2 prevents formation of the RIP1-RIP3 complex in mice. Furthermore, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of SIRT2 blocks cellular necrosis induced by TNF-alpha. We further demonstrate that RIP1 is a critical target of SIRT2-dependent deacetylation. Using gain- and loss-of-function mutants, we demonstrate that acetylation of RIP1 lysine 530 modulates RIP1-RIP3 complex formation and TNF-alpha-stimulated necrosis. In the setting of ischaemia-reperfusion injury, RIP1 is deacetylated in a SIRT2-dependent fashion. Furthermore, the hearts of Sirt2(-/-) mice, or wild-type mice treated with a specific pharmacological inhibitor of SIRT2, show marked protection from ischaemic injury. Taken together, these results implicate SIRT2 as an important regulator of programmed necrosis and indicate that inhibitors of this deacetylase may constitute a novel approach to protect against necrotic injuries, including ischaemic stroke and myocardial infarction.","[Narayan, Nisha; Lee, In Hye; Borenstein, Ronen; Fergusson, Maria M.; Liu, Jie; Rovira, Ilsa I.; Sack, Michael N.; Finkel, Toren] NHLBI, Ctr Mol Med, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Sun, Junhui; Wong, Renee; Tong, Guang; Murphy, Elizabeth] NHLBI, Syst Biol Ctr, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Tong, Guang] Fourth Mil Med Univ, Xijing Hosp, Dept Cardiovasc Surg, Xian 710032, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Hwei-Ling; Alt, Fredrick W.] Childrens Hosp, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Program Cellular & Mol Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Cheng, Hwei-Ling; Alt, Fredrick W.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Cheng, Hwei-Ling; Alt, Fredrick W.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Wang, Guanghui; Gucek, Marjan] NHLBI, Prote Core, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Lombard, David] Univ Michigan, Dept Pathol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Lombard, David] Univ Michigan, Inst Gerontol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Cao, Liu] China Med Univ, Key Lab Med Cell Biol, Shenyang 110001, Peoples R China","Finkel, T (reprint author), NHLBI, Ctr Mol Med, NIH, Bldg 10, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",finkelt@nih.gov,,"Lombard, David/0000-0002-4292-0185",NIH,"We are grateful to M.

By contrast, large T antigen, the replicative DNA helicase of the simian virus 40 (SV40), is reported to function as a pair of stacked hexamers that pumps double-stranded DNA through its central channel while laterally extruding single-stranded DNA. Here we use single-molecule and ensemble assays to show that large T antigen assembled on the SV40 origin unwinds DNA efficiently as a single hexamer that translocates on single-stranded DNA in the 3'-to-5' direction. Unexpectedly, large T antigen unwinds DNA past a DNA-protein crosslink on the translocation strand, suggesting that the large T antigen ring can open to bypass bulky adducts.

The defining, and highly unusual, property of the Tat pathway is that it transports folded proteins, a task that must be achieved without allowing appreciable ion leakage across the membrane. The integral membrane TatC protein is the central component of the Tat pathway. TatC captures substrate proteins by binding their signal peptides. TatC then recruits TatA family proteins to form the active translocation complex. Here we report the crystal structure of TatC from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Aquifex aeolicus. This structure provides a molecular description of the core of the Tat translocation system and a framework for understanding the unique Tat transport mechanism.","[Rollauer, Sarah E.; Graham, James E.; Krehenbrink, Martin; Liu, Sai-Man; Lukey, Michael J.; Rodriguez, Fernanda; Stansfeld, Phillip J.; Sansom, Mark S.

However, designing drugs with a specific multi-target profile is both complex and difficult. Therefore methods to design drugs rationally a priori against profiles of several proteins would have immense value in drug discovery. Here we describe a new approach for the automated design of ligands against profiles of multiple drug targets. The method is demonstrated by the evolution of an approved acetylcholinesterase inhibitor drug into brain-penetrable ligands with either specific polypharmacology or exquisite selectivity profiles for G-protein-coupled receptors. Overall, 800 ligand-target predictions of prospectively designed ligands were tested experimentally, of which 75% were confirmed to be correct. We also demonstrate target engagement in vivo. The approach can be a useful source of drug leads when multi-target profiles are required to achieve either selectivity over other drug targets or a desired polypharmacology.","[Besnard, Jeremy; Ruda, Gian Filippo; Abecassis, Keren; Norval, Suzanne; Webster, Lauren A.; Simeons, Frederick R.

Various hypotheses have been proposed to overcome this problem, including the suggestion that ultrawide binaries result from the dissolution of a star cluster-when a cluster star gravitationally captures another, distant, cluster star(5-7). Recent observations have shown that very wide binaries are frequently members of triple systems(8,9) and that close binaries often have a distant third companion(10-12). Here we report N-body simulations of the dynamical evolution of newborn triple systems still embedded in their nascent cloud cores that match observations of very wide systems(13-15). We find that although the triple systems are born very compact-and therefore initially are more protected against disruption by passing stars(16,17)-they can develop extreme hierarchical architectures on timescales of millions of years as one component is dynamically scattered into a very distant orbit. The energy of ejection comes from shrinking the orbits of the other two stars, often making them look from a distance like a single star. Such loosely bound triple systems will therefore appear to be very wide binaries.","[Reipurth, Bo] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Inst Astron, Hilo, HI 96720 USA; [Mikkola, Seppo] Univ Turku, Tuorla Observ, FI-21500 Piikkio, Finland","Reipurth, B (reprint author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Inst Astron, 640 N Aohoku Pl, Hilo, HI 96720 USA.",reipurth@ifa.hawaii.edu,,,National Aeronautics and Space Administration through the NASA Astrobiology Institute through the Office of Space Science [NNA09DA77A],"We thank C.

The Fe XVII spectrum is, however, poorly fitted by even the best astrophysical models. A particular problem has been that the intensity of the strongest Fe XVII line is generally weaker than predicted(2,3). This has affected the interpretation of observations by the Chandra and XMM-Newton orbiting X-ray missions(1), fuelling a continuing controversy over whether this discrepancy is caused by incomplete modelling of the plasma environment in these objects or by shortcomings in the treatment of the underlying atomic physics. Here we report the results of an experiment in which a target of iron ions was induced to fluoresce by subjecting it to femtosecond X-ray pulses from a free-electron laser(4); our aim was to isolate a key aspect of the quantum mechanical description of the line emission. Surprisingly, we find a relative oscillator strength that is unexpectedly low, differing by 3.6 sigma from the best quantum mechanical calculations. Our measurements suggest that the poor agreement is rooted in the quality of the underlying atomic wavefunctions rather than in insufficient modelling of collisional processes.","[Bernitt, S.; Rudolph, J.

In particular, spectroscopy by means of optical frequency combs has surpassed the precision and speed of Fourier spectrometers. Such a spectroscopy technique is especially relevant for the mid-infrared range, where the fundamental rotational-vibrational bands of most light molecules are found(2). Most mid-infrared comb sources are based on down-conversion of near-infrared, mode-locked, ultrafast lasers using nonlinear crystals(3). Their use in frequency comb spectroscopy applications has resulted in an unequalled combination of spectral coverage, resolution and sensitivity(4-7). Another means of comb generation is pumping an ultrahigh-quality factor microresonator with a continuous-wave laser(8-10). However, these combs depend on a chain of optical components, which limits their use. Therefore, to widen the spectroscopic applications of such mid-infrared combs, a more direct and compact generation scheme, using electrical injection, is preferable. Here we present a compact, broadband, semiconductor frequency comb generator that operates in the mid-infrared. We demonstrate that the modes of a continuous-wave, free-running, broadband quantum cascade laser(11) are phase-locked. Combining mode proliferation based on four-wave mixing with gain provided by the quantum cascade laser leads to a phase relation similar to that of a frequency-modulated laser. The comb centre carrier wavelength is 7 micrometres. We identify a narrow drive current range with intermode beat linewidths narrower than 10 hertz. We find comb bandwidths of 4.4 per cent with an intermode stability of less than or equal to 200 hertz. The intermode beat can be varied over a frequency range of 65 kilohertz by radio-frequency injection. The large gain bandwidth and independent control over the carrier frequency offset and the mode spacing open the way to broadband, compact, all-solid-state mid-infrared spectrometers.","[Hugi, Andreas; Villares, Gustavo; Faist, Jerome] ETH, Inst Quantum Elect, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Blaser, Stephane] Alpes Lasers SA, CH-2001 Neuchatel, Switzerland; [Liu, H.

In particular, great advances have been made in the development of materials for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), from early devices based on fluorescent molecules(1) to those using phosphorescent molecules(2,3). In OLEDs, electrically injected charge carriers recombine to form singlet and triplet excitons in a 1:3 ratio(1); the use of phosphorescent metal-organic complexes exploits the normally non-radiative triplet excitons and so enhances the overall electroluminescence efficiency(2,3). Here we report a class of metal-free organic electroluminescent molecules in which the energy gap between the singlet and triplet excited states is minimized by design(4), thereby promoting highly efficient spin up-conversion from non-radiative triplet states to radiative singlet states while maintaining high radiative decay rates, of more than 10(6) decays per second. In other words, these molecules harness both singlet and triplet excitons for light emission through fluorescence decay channels, leading to an intrinsic fluorescence efficiency in excess of 90 per cent and a very high external electroluminescence efficiency, of more than 19 per cent, which is comparable to that achieved in high-efficiency phosphorescence-based OLEDs(3).","[Uoyama, Hiroki; Goushi, Kenichi; Shizu, Katsuyuki; Nomura, Hiroko; Adachi, Chihaya] Kyushu Univ, Ctr Organ Photon & Elect Res, Nishi Ku, Fukuoka 8190395, Japan; [Goushi, Kenichi; Adachi, Chihaya] Kyushu Univ, Int Inst Carbon Neutral Energy Res WPI I2CNER, Nishi Ku, Fukuoka 8190395, Japan","Adachi, C (reprint author), Kyushu Univ, Ctr Organ Photon & Elect Res, Nishi Ku, 744 Motooka, Fukuoka 8190395, Japan.",adachi@opera.kyushu-u.ac.jp,"Adachi, Chihaya/C-2849-2011; U-ID, Kyushu/C-5291-2016","Adachi, Chihaya/0000-0001-6117-9604; ","Funding Program for World-Leading Innovative R&D on Science and Technology (FIRST); International Institute for Carbon Neutral Energy Research (WPI-I2CNER); Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology","This work was supported by the Funding Program for World-Leading Innovative R&D on Science and Technology (FIRST) and the International Institute for Carbon Neutral Energy Research (WPI-I2CNER), sponsored by the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology.

Regional and global climate models simulate enhanced snowfall over Antarctica, which would provide a direct offset of the future contribution to global sea level rise from cryospheric mass loss(2,3) and ocean expansion(4). Uncertainties exist in modelled snowfall(5), but even larger uncertainties exist in the potential changes of dynamic ice discharge from Antarctica(1,6) and thus in the ultimate fate of the precipitation-deposited ice mass. Here we show that snowfall and discharge are not independent, but that future ice discharge will increase by up to three times as a result of additional snowfall under global warming. Our results, based on an ice-sheet model(7) forced by climate simulations through to the end of 2500 (ref. 8), show that the enhanced discharge effect exceeds the effect of surface warming as well as that of basal ice-shelf melting, and is due to the difference in surface elevation change caused by snowfall on grounded versus floating ice. Although different underlying forcings drive ice loss from basal melting versus increased snowfall, similar ice dynamical processes are nonetheless at work in both; therefore results are relatively independent of the specific representation of the transition zone. In an ensemble of simulations designed to capture ice-physics uncertainty, the additional dynamic ice loss along the coastline compensates between 30 and 65 per cent of the ice gain due to enhanced snowfall over the entire continent. This results in a dynamic ice loss of up to 1.25 metres in the year 2500 for the strongest warming scenario. The reported effect thus strongly counters a potential negative contribution to global sea level by the Antarctic Ice Sheet.","[Winkelmann, R.; Levermann, A.; Martin, M.

Iron enrichment may occur at the bottom of the mantle, leading to low seismic-wave velocities and high electrical conductivity(2-5), but plausible physical processes of iron enrichment have not been suggested. Diffusion-controlled iron enrichment is inefficient because it is too slow(6), although the diffusion can be fast enough along grain boundaries for some elements(7). More fundamentally, experimental studies and geophysical observations show that the core is under-saturated with oxygen, implying that the mantle next to the core should be depleted in FeO. Here we show that (Mg,Fe)O in contact with iron-rich liquids leads to a morphological instability, causing blobs of iron-rich liquid to penetrate the oxide. This morphological instability is generated by the chemical potential gradient between two materials when they are not in bulk chemical equilibrium, and should be a common process in Earth's interior. Iron-rich melt could be transported 50 to 100 kilometres away from the core-mantle boundary by this mechanism, providing an explanation for the iron-rich regions in the mantle.","[Otsuka, Kazuhiko; Karato, Shun-ichiro] Yale Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, New Haven, CT 06511 USA","Karato, S (reprint author), Yale Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, 210 Whitney Ave, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",shun-ichiro.karato@yale.edu,,,National Science Foundation [EAR-0809330],"We are grateful to Z.

However, little is known about the role of neuronal dendrites in behaviourally related circuit computations. Here we report that a novel global dendritic nonlinearity is involved in the integration of sensory and motor information within layer 5 pyramidal neurons during an active sensing behaviour. Layer 5 pyramidal neurons possess elaborate dendritic arborizations that receive functionally distinct inputs, each targeted to spatially separate regions(1,2). At the cellular level, coincident input from these segregated pathways initiates regenerative dendritic electrical events that produce bursts of action potential output(3,4) and circuits featuring this powerful dendritic nonlinearity can implement computations based on input correlation(5). To examine this in vivo we recorded dendritic activity in layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the barrel cortex using two-photon calcium imagingin mice performing an object-localization task. Large-amplitude, global calcium signals were observed throughout the apical tuft dendrites when active touch occurred at particular object locations or whisker angles. Such global calcium signals are produced by dendritic plateau potentials that require both vibrissal sensory input and primary motor cortex activity. These data provide direct evidence of nonlinear dendritic processing of correlated sensory and motor information in the mammalian neocortex during active sensation.","[Xu, Ning-long; Harnett, Mark T.; Huber, Daniel; O'Connor, Daniel H.; Svoboda, Karel; Magee, Jeffrey C.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA; [Williams, Stephen R.] Univ Queensland, Queensland Brain Inst, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia","Magee, JC (reprint author), Howard Hughes Med Inst, Janelia Farm Res Campus, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA.",mageej@janelia.hhmi.org,"Huber, Daniel/C-2932-2013","Xu, Ninglong/0000-0002-1651-401X; Williams, Stephen/0000-0001-5352-7947",Australian research council [FT100100502]; Australian National Health and Medical Research Council [APP1004575],"We thank L.

Macrophages and other cells respond to infection by releasing cytokines, such as interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), which in turn activate a well-described, myeloid-differentiation factor 88 (MYD88)-mediated, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B)-dependent transcriptional pathway that results in inflammatory-cell activation and recruitment(1-4). Endothelial cells, which usually serve as a barrier to the movement of inflammatory cells out of the blood and into tissue, are also critical mediators of the inflammatory response(5,6). Paradoxically, the cytokines vital to a successful immune defence also have disruptive effects on endothelial cell-cell interactions and can trigger degradation of barrier function and dissociation of tissue architecture(7-9). The mechanism of this barrier dissolution and its relationship to the canonical NF-kappa B pathway remain poorly defined. Here we show that the direct, immediate and disruptive effects of IL-1 beta on endothelial stability in a human in vitro cell model are NF-kappa B independent and are instead the result of signalling through the small GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) and its activator ARF nucleotide binding site opener (ARNO; also known as CYTH2). Moreover, we show that ARNO binds directly to the adaptor protein MYD88, and thus propose MYD88-ARNO-ARF6 as a proximal IL-1 beta signalling pathway distinct from that mediated by NF-kappa B. Finally, we show that SecinH3, an inhibitor of ARF guanine nucleotide-exchange factors such as ARNO, enhances vascular stability and significantly improves outcomes in animal models of inflammatory arthritis and acute inflammation.","[Zhu, Weiquan; London, Nyall R.; Guo, Jinping; Smith, Matthew C.

Merr.) is an important crop that provides a sustainable source of protein and oil worldwide. Soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines Ichinohe) is a microscopic roundworm that feeds on the roots of soybean and is a major constraint to soybean production. This nematode causes more than US$1 billion in yield losses annually in the United States alone(1), making it the most economically important pathogen on soybean. Although planting of resistant cultivars forms the core management strategy for this pathogen, nothing is known about the nature of resistance. Moreover, the increase in virulent populations of this parasite on most known resistance sources necessitates the development of novel approaches for control. Here we report the map-based cloning of a gene at the Rhg4 (for resistance to Heterodera glycines 4) locus, a major quantitative trait locus contributing to resistance to this pathogen. Mutation analysis, gene silencing and transgenic complementation confirm that the gene confers resistance. The gene encodes a serine hydroxymethyltransferase, an enzyme that is ubiquitous in nature and structurally conserved across kingdoms. The enzyme is responsible for interconversion of serine and glycine and is essential for cellular one-carbon metabolism. Alleles of Rhg4 conferring resistance or susceptibility differ by two genetic polymorphisms that alter a key regulatory property of the enzyme. Our discovery reveals an unprecedented plant resistance mechanism against a pathogen. The mechanistic knowledge of the resistance gene can be readily exploited to improve nematode resistance of soybean, an increasingly important global crop.","[Liu, Shiming; Jamai, Aziz; El-Mellouki, Tarik; Meksem, Khalid] So Illinois Univ, Dept Plant Soil & Agr Syst, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA; [Kandoth, Pramod K.; Yeckel, Greg; Heinz, Robert; Alden, John; Mitchum, Melissa G.] Univ Missouri, Christopher S Bond Life Sci Ctr, Div Plant Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Kandoth, Pramod K.; Yeckel, Greg; Heinz, Robert; Alden, John; Mitchum, Melissa G.] Univ Missouri, Interdisciplinary Plant Grp, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Warren, Samantha D.; Korkin, Dmitry] Univ Missouri, Christopher S Bond Life Sci Ctr, Dept Comp Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Warren, Samantha D.; Korkin, Dmitry] Univ Missouri, Inst Informat, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Yang, Chunling; Juvale, Parijat S.; Hill, John; Baum, Thomas J.; Whitham, Steven A.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Plant Pathol & Microbiol, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Cianzio, Silvia] Iowa State Univ, Dept Agron, Ames, IA 50011 USA","Meksem, K (reprint author), So Illinois Univ, Dept Plant Soil & Agr Syst, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA.",goellnerm@missouri.edu; meksemk@siu.edu,,,"Illinois-Missouri Biotechnology Alliance [2005-3]; United Soybean Board [0253, 3253, 2268, 1251]; USDA-NIFA [2006-35300-17195]; National Science Foundation Plant Genome Research Program [0820642]; Illinois Soybean Association; North Central Soybean Research Program; Iowa Soybean Association; Department of Education Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need (GAANN) Fellowship","We thank X.

They are considered to be both a target of the ageing process and a contributor to it(1). Alterations in mitochondrial structure and function are evident during ageing in most eukaryotes(2), but how this occurs is poorly understood. Here we identify a functional link between the lysosome-like vacuole and mitochondria in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and show that mitochondrial dysfunction in replicatively aged yeast arises from altered vacuolar pH. We found that vacuolar acidity declines during the early asymmetric divisions of a mother cell, and that preventing this decline suppresses mitochondrial dysfunction and extends lifespan. Surprisingly, changes in vacuolar pH do not limit mitochondrial function by disrupting vacuolar protein degradation, but rather by reducing pH-dependent amino acid storage in the vacuolar lumen. We also found that calorie restriction promotes lifespan extension at least in part by increasing vacuolar acidity via conserved nutrient-sensing pathways(3). Interestingly, although vacuolar acidity is reduced in aged mother cells, acidic vacuoles are regenerated in newborn daughters, coinciding with daughter cells having a renewed lifespan potential(4). Overall, our results identify vacuolar pH as a critical regulator of ageing and mitochondrial function, and outline a potentially conserved mechanism by which calorie restriction delays the ageing process. Because the functions of the vacuole are highly conserved throughout evolution(5), we propose that lysosomal pH may modulate mitochondrial function and lifespan in other eukaryotic cells.","[Hughes, Adam L.; Gottschling, Daniel E.] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Div Basic Sci, Seattle, WA 98109 USA","Gottschling, DE (reprint author), Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Div Basic Sci, Seattle, WA 98109 USA.",dgottsch@fhcrc.org,,"Hughes, Adam/0000-0002-7095-3793","National Institutes of Health [AG037512, AG023779]; Glenn Award for Research in Biological Mechanisms of Aging; Helen Hay Whitney Foundation; Genetic Approaches to Aging Training Grant [T32 AG000057]","We thank L.

Ubiquitin chains represent a biologically important multidomain system that requires recognition by structurally diverse ubiquitin-interacting proteins(2,3). Ubiquitin chain conformations in isolation are often different from conformations observed in ubiquitin-interacting protein complexes, indicating either great dynamic flexibility or extensive chain remodelling upon binding. Using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer, we show that Lys 63-, Lys 48- and Met 1-linked diubiquitin exist in several distinct conformational states in solution. Lys 63- and Met 1-linked diubiquitin adopt extended 'open' and more compact 'closed' conformations, and ubiquitin-binding domains and deubiquitinases (DUBs) select pre-existing conformations. By contrast, Lys 48-linked diubiquitin adopts predominantly compact conformations. DUBs directly recognize existing conformations, but may also remodel ubiquitin chains to hydrolyse the isopeptide bond. Disruption of the Lys 48-diubiquitin interface changes conformational dynamics and affects DUB activity. Hence, conformational equilibria in ubiquitin chains provide an additional layer of regulation in the ubiquitin system, and distinct conformations observed in differently linked polyubiquitin may contribute to the specificity of ubiquitin-interacting proteins.","[Ye, Yu; Komander, David] MRC, Mol Biol Lab, Div Prot & Nucle Acids Chem, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England; [Blaser, Georg; Horrocks, Mathew H.; Ibrahim, Shehu; Zhukov, Alexander A.; Klenerman, David; Jackson, Sophie E.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Chem, Cambridge CB2 1EW, England; [Ruedas-Rama, Maria J.; Orte, Angel] Univ Granada, Fac Pharm, Dept Phys Chem, E-18071 Granada, Spain","Komander, D (reprint author), MRC, Mol Biol Lab, Div Prot & Nucle Acids Chem, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England.",dk10012@cam.ac.uk; sej13@cam.ac.uk; dk@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk,"Ruedas-Rama, Maria Jose/L-2277-2014; Orte, Angel/J-4810-2012","Ruedas-Rama, Maria Jose/0000-0003-0853-187X; Orte, Angel/0000-0003-1905-4183; Klenerman, David/0000-0001-7116-6954",Medical Research Council [U105192732]; EMBO Young Investigator Program; BBSRC; Newton Trust; EMBO YIP small grant; EPSRC,"We would like to thank members of the Komander, Jackson and Klenerman laboratories, R.

The proper localization of these proteins is mediated by a universally conserved protein-targeting machinery, the signal recognition particle (SRP), which recognizes ribosomes carrying signal sequences(2-4) and, through interactions with the SRP receptor(5,6), delivers them to the protein-translocation machinery on the target membrane(7). The SRP is an ancient ribonucleoprotein particle containing an essential, elongated SRP RNA for which precise functions have remained elusive. Here we used single-molecule fluorescence microscopy to show that the Escherichia coli SRP-SRP receptor GTPase complex, after initial assembly at the tetra-loop end of SRP RNA, travels over 100 angstrom to the distal end of this RNA, where rapid GTP hydrolysis occurs. This movement is negatively regulated by the translating ribosome and, at a later stage, positively regulated by the SecYEG translocon, providing an attractive mechanism for ensuring the productive exchange of the targeting and translocation machineries at the ribosome exit site with high spatial and temporal accuracy. Our results show that large RNAs can act as molecular scaffolds that enable the easy exchange of distinct factors and precise timing of molecular events in a complex cellular process; this concept may be extended to similar phenomena in other ribonucleoprotein complexes.","[Shen, Kuang; Akopian, David; Shan, Shu-ou] CALTECH, Div Chem & Chem Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Arslan, Sinan; Ha, Taekjip] Univ Illinois, Dept Phys, Ctr Phys Living Cells, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Ha, Taekjip] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Shan, SO (reprint author), CALTECH, Div Chem & Chem Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",sshan@caltech.edu,"Shen, Kuang/H-9441-2016; Ha, Taekjip/B-9506-2009","Arslan, Sinan/0000-0001-7270-8372; Ha, Taekjip/0000-0003-2195-6258","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [GM078024, GM45162, GM065367]; Caltech [350270]; Beckman Young Investigator award; David and Lucile Packard Fellowship in Science and Engineering; Henry Dreyfus Teacher-Scholar award; National Science Foundation Physics Frontiers Centers program [08222613]","We thank N.

To coordinate cell division with chromosome segregation, the mitotic spindle controls cytokinetic events at the cell envelope. The spindle midzone stimulates the actomyosin-driven contraction of the cleavage furrow, which proceeds until the formation of a microtubule-rich intercellular bridge with the midbody at its centre. The midbody directs the final membrane abscission reaction(1,2) and has been proposed to attach the cleavage furrow to the intercellular bridge(3). How the mitotic spindle is connected to the plasma membrane during cytokinesis is not understood. Here we identify a plasma membrane tethering activity in the centralspindlin protein complex, a conserved component of the spindle midzone and midbody(4). We demonstrate that the C1 domain of the centralspindlin subunit MgcRacGAP associates with the plasma membrane by interacting with polyanionic phosphoinositide lipids. Using X-ray crystallography we determine the structure of this atypical C1 domain. Mutations in the hydrophobic cap and in basic residues of the C1 domain of MgcRacGAP prevent association of the protein with the plasma membrane, and abrogate cytokinesis in human and chicken cells. Artificial membrane tethering of centralspindlin restores cell division in the absence of the C1 domain of MgcRacGAP. Although C1 domain function is dispensable for the formation of the midzone and midbody, it promotes contractility and is required for the attachment of the plasma membrane to the midbody, a long-postulated function of this organelle(3). Our analysis suggests that centralspindlin links the mitotic spindle to the plasma membrane to secure the final cut during cytokinesis in animal cells.","[Lekomtsev, Sergey; Su, Kuan-Chung; Sundaramoorthy, Sriramkumar; Takaki, Tohru; Petronczki, Mark] Canc Res UK London Res Inst, Clare Hall Labs, Cell Div, S Mimms EN6 3LD, Herts, England; [Lekomtsev, Sergey; Su, Kuan-Chung; Sundaramoorthy, Sriramkumar; Takaki, Tohru; Petronczki, Mark] Canc Res UK London Res Inst, Clare Hall Labs, Aneuploidy Lab, S Mimms EN6 3LD, Herts, England; [Pye, Valerie E.; Cherepanov, Peter] Canc Res UK London Res Inst, Clare Hall Labs, Chromatin Struct & Mobile DNA Lab, S Mimms EN6 3LD, Herts, England; [Blight, Ken; Collinson, Lucy M.] Canc Res UK London Res Inst, Electron Microscopy Unit, London WC2A 3PX, England; [Divecha, Nullin] Univ Manchester, Paterson Inst Canc Res, Inositide Lab, Manchester M20 4BX, Lancs, England","Petronczki, M (reprint author), Canc Res UK London Res Inst, Clare Hall Labs, Cell Div, Blanche Lane, S Mimms EN6 3LD, Herts, England.",mark.petronczki@cancer.org.uk,"Cherepanov, Peter/F-6859-2010","Cherepanov, Peter/0000-0002-0634-538X; Petronczki, Mark/0000-0003-0139-5692; Pye, Valerie E/0000-0001-9616-2992",Cancer Research UK; EMBO,"We would like to thank W.

These CRCs contain a catalytic subunit that bears an ATPase/DNA-translocase domain and flanking regions that bind nucleosomal epitopes(1). A central question is whether and how these flanking regions regulate ATP hydrolysis or the coupling of hydrolysis to DNA translocation, to affect nucleosome-sliding efficiency. ISWI-family CRCs contain the protein ISWI2, which uses its ATPase/DNA-translocase domain to pump DNA around the histone octamer to enable sliding(3-7). ISWI is positively regulated by two 'activating' nucleosomal epitopes: the 'basic patch' on the histone H4 tail, and extranucleosomal (linker) DNA(8-13). Previous work defined the HAND-SANT-SLIDE (HSS) domain at the ISWI carboxy terminus that binds linker DNA, needed for ISWI activity(14,15). Here we define two new, conserved and separate regulatory regions on Drosophila ISWI, termed AutoN and NegC, which negatively regulate ATP hydrolysis (AutoN) or the coupling of ATP hydrolysis to productive DNA translocation (NegC). The two aforementioned nucleosomal epitopes promote remodelling indirectly by preventing the negative regulation of AutoN and NegC. Notably, mutation or removal of AutoN and NegC enables marked nucleosome sliding without the H4 basic patch or extranucleosomal DNA, or the HSS domain, conferring on ISWI the biochemical attributes normally associated with SWI/SNF-family ATPases. Thus, the ISWI ATPase catalytic core is an intrinsically active DNA translocase that conducts nucleosome sliding, onto which selective 'inhibition-of-inhibition' modules are placed, to help ensure that remodelling occurs only in the presence of proper nucleosomal epitopes. This supports a general concept for the specialization of chromatin-remodelling ATPases, in which specific regulatory modules adapt an ancient active DNA translocase to conduct particular tasks only on the appropriate chromatin landscape.","[Clapier, Cedric R.; Cairns, Bradley R.] Univ Utah, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Sch Med, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Clapier, Cedric R.; Cairns, Bradley R.] Univ Utah, Sch Med, Dept Oncol Sci, Huntsman Canc Inst, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA","Cairns, BR (reprint author), Univ Utah, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Sch Med, 2000 Circle Hope, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",cedric.clapier@hci.utah.edu; brad.cairns@hci.utah.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health [GM60415, CA042014]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute","We thank S.

Shelterin includes the heterodimeric POT1-TPP1 protein, which binds the telomeric single-stranded DNA tail(4-9). TPP1 has been implicated both in recruiting telomerase to telomeres and in stimulating telomerase processivity (the addition of multiple DNA repeats after a single primer-binding event)(9-14). Determining the mechanisms of these activities has been difficult, especially because genetic perturbations also tend to affect the essential chromosome end-protection function of TPP1 (refs 15-17). Here we identify separation-of-function mutants of human TPP1 that retain full telomere-capping function in vitro and in vivo, yet are defective in binding human telomerase. The seven separation-of-function mutations map to a patch of amino acids on the surface of TPP1, the TEL patch, that both recruits telomerase to telomeres and promotes high-processivity DNA synthesis, indicating that these two activities are manifestations of the same molecular interaction. Given that the interaction between telomerase and TPP1 is required for telomerase function in vivo, the TEL patch of TPP1 provides a new target for anticancer drug development.","[Nandakumar, Jayakrishnan; Bell, Caitlin F.; Weidenfeld, Ina; Zaug, Arthur J.; Leinwand, Leslie A.; Cech, Thomas R.] Univ Colorado, BioFrontiers Inst, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Nandakumar, Jayakrishnan; Bell, Caitlin F.; Zaug, Arthur J.; Cech, Thomas R.] Univ Colorado, Dept Chem & Biochem, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Nandakumar, Jayakrishnan; Bell, Caitlin F.; Zaug, Arthur J.; Cech, Thomas R.] Univ Colorado, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Weidenfeld, Ina; Leinwand, Leslie A.; Cech, Thomas R.] Univ Colorado, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","Cech, TR (reprint author), Univ Colorado, BioFrontiers Inst, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",thomas.cech@colorado.edu,,"LEINWAND, LESLIE/0000-0003-1470-4810; Nandakumar, Jayakrishnan/0000-0001-9146-2785","National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health [K99CA167644]; US National Institutes of Health [R01GM29090, R01GM099705]","We thank T. de Lange, M.

Here we show that compartmentalized Drosophila olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) communicate with each other directly. The sustained response of one ORN is inhibited by the transient activation of a neighbouring ORN. Mechanistically, such lateral inhibition does not depend on synapses and is probably mediated by ephaptic coupling. Moreover, lateral inhibition in the periphery can modulate olfactory behaviour. Together, the results show that integration of olfactory information can occur via lateral interactions between ORNs. Inhibition of a sustained response by a transient response may provide a means of encoding salience. Finally, a CO2-sensitive ORN in the malaria mosquito Anopheles can also be inhibited by excitation of an adjacent ORN, suggesting a broad occurrence of lateral inhibition in insects and possible applications in insect control.","[Su, Chih-Ying; Menuz, Karen; Carlson, John R.] Yale Univ, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Reisert, Johannes] Monell Chem Senses Ctr, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Carlson, JR (reprint author), Yale Univ, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",john.carlson@yale.edu,,"Menuz, Karen/0000-0001-8163-0941",National Institutes of Health (NIH) [NIH DC009613]; Foundation for the NIH through the Grand Challenges in Global Health Initiative (GCGH) [121]; NRSA [NIH F32DC011242],"We thank J.

The metric of this representation is provided by grid cells, cells with spatial firing fields that tile environments in a periodic hexagonal pattern. Limited anatomical sampling has obscured whether the grid system operates as a unified system or a conglomerate of independent modules. Here we show with recordings from up to 186 grid cells in individual rats that grid cells cluster into a small number of layer-spanning anatomically overlapping modules with distinct scale, orientation, asymmetry and theta-frequency modulation. These modules can respond independently to changes in the geometry of the environment. The discrete topography of the grid-map, and the apparent autonomy of the modules, differ from the graded topography of maps for continuous variables in several sensory systems, raising the possibility that the modularity of the grid map is a product of local self-organizing network dynamics.","[Stensola, Hanne; Stensola, Tor; Solstad, Trygve; Froland, Kristian; Moser, May-Britt; Moser, Edvard I.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Kavli Inst Syst Neurosci, MTFS, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Stensola, Hanne; Stensola, Tor; Solstad, Trygve; Froland, Kristian; Moser, May-Britt; Moser, Edvard I.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Kavli Inst Syst Neurosci, Ctr Biol Memory, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway","Moser, EI (reprint author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Kavli Inst Syst Neurosci, MTFS, Olav Kyrres Gate 9, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",hanne.stensola@ntnu.no; tor.stensola@ntnu.no; edvard.moser@ntnu.no,,,European Research Council ('CIRCUIT') [232608]; Kavli Foundation; Centre of Excellence scheme of the Research Council of Norway,"We thank A.

Lower abundances have been seen in selected stars in the Milky Way's halo(1-3) and in two quasar absorption systems at redshift z = 3 (ref. 4). These are widely interpreted as relics from the early Universe, when all gas possessed a primordial chemistry. Before now there have been no direct abundance measurements from the first billion years after the Big Bang, when the earliest stars began synthesizing elements. Here we report observations of hydrogen and heavy-element absorption in a spectrum of a quasar at z = 7.04, when the Universe was just 772 million years old (5.6 per cent of its present age). We detect a large column of neutral hydrogen but no corresponding metals (defined as elements heavier than helium), limiting the chemical abundance to less than 1/10,000 times the solar level if the gas is in a gravitationally bound proto-galaxy, or to less than 1/1,000 times the solar value if it is diffuse and unbound. If the absorption is truly intergalactic(5,6), it would imply that the Universe was neither ionized by starlight nor chemically enriched in this neighbourhood at z approximate to 7. If it is gravitationally bound, the inferred abundance is too low to promote efficient cooling(7,8), and the system would be a viable site to form the predicted but as yet unobserved massive population III stars.","[Simcoe, Robert A.; Sullivan, Peter W.; Cooksey, Kathy L.; Kao, Melodie M.; Matejek, Michael S.] MIT Kavli Inst Astrophys & Space Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Kao, Melodie M.] CALTECH, Dept Astron, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Burgasser, Adam J.] Univ Calif San Diego, Ctr Astrophys & Space Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Simcoe, RA (reprint author), MIT Kavli Inst Astrophys & Space Res, 77 Massachusetts Ave,Bldg 37,Room 664L, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",simcoe@space.mit.edu,,,"NSF [AST-0908920, AST-1109115]","We thank J.

Until now, the smallest observed protostar-to-envelope mass ratio was about 2.1 (ref. 1). The protostar L1527 IRS is thought to be in the earliest stages of star formation(2). Its envelope contains about one solar mass of material within a radius of about 0.05 parsecs (refs 3, 4), and earlier observations suggested the presence of an edge-on disk(5). Here we report observations of dust continuum emission and (CO)-C-13 (rotational quantum number J = 2 -> 1) line emission from the disk around L1527 IRS, from which we determine a protostellar mass of 0.19 +/- 0.04 solar masses and a protostar-to-envelope mass ratio of about 0.2. We conclude that most of the luminosity is generated through the accretion process, with an accretion rate of about 6.6 x 10(-7) solar masses per year. If it has been accreting at that rate through much of its life, its age is approximately 300,000 years, although theory suggests larger accretion rates earlier(6), so it may be younger. The presence of a rotationally supported disk is confirmed, and significantly more mass may be added to its planet-forming region as well as to the protostar itself in the future.","[Tobin, John J.] Natl Radio Astron Observ, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Hartmann, Lee; Calvet, Nuria] Univ Michigan, Dept Astron, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Chiang, Hsin-Fang; Looney, Leslie W.] Univ Illinois, Dept Astron, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Chiang, Hsin-Fang] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Inst Astron, Hilo, HI 96720 USA; [Chiang, Hsin-Fang] Univ Hawaii Manoa, NASA Astrobiol Inst, Hilo, HI 96720 USA; [Wilner, David J.] Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Loinard, Laurent; D'Alessio, Paola] UNAM, Ctr Radioastron & Astrofis, Morelia 58089, Michoacan, Mexico; [Loinard, Laurent] Max Planck Inst Radioastron, D-53121 Bonn, Germany","Tobin, JJ (reprint author), Natl Radio Astron Observ, Edgemont Rd, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA.",jtobin@nrao.edu,,,"NASA [HSTHF-51300.01-A, NAS 5-26555]; Space Telescope Science Institute; University of Michigan; NASA through the NASA Astrobiology Institute through the Office of Space Science [NNA09DA77A]; Laboratory for Astronomical Imaging at the University of Illinois; NSF [AST-07-09206]; PAPIIT-UNAM; DGAPA; UNAM; CONACyT (Mexico); Alexander von Humboldt Stiftung; Smithsonian Institution; Academia Sinica","We thank E.

Metamaterials based on metallic elements are particularly efficient as absorbing media, because both the electrical and the magnetic properties of a metamaterial can be tuned by structured design(4). So far, metamaterial absorbers in the infrared or visible range have been fabricated using lithographically patterned metallic structures(2,5-9), making them inherently difficult to produce over large areas and hence reducing their applicability. Here we demonstrate a simple method to create a metamaterial absorber by randomly adsorbing chemically synthesized silver nanocubes onto a nanoscale-thick polymer spacer layer on a gold film, making no effort to control the spatial arrangement of the cubes on the film. We show that the film-coupled nanocubes provide a reflectance spectrum that can be tailored by varying the geometry (the size of the cubes and/or the thickness of the spacer). Each nanocube is the optical analogue of a grounded patch antenna, with a nearly identical local field structure that is modified by the plasmonic response of the metal's dielectric function, and with an anomalously large absorption efficiency that can be partly attributed to an interferometric effect(10). The absorptivity of large surface areas can be controlled using this method, at scales out of reach of lithographic approaches (such as electron-beam lithography) that are otherwise required to manipulate matter on the nanoscale.","[Moreau, Antoine; Ciraci, Cristian; Mock, Jack J.; Smith, David R.] Duke Univ, Ctr Metamat & Integrated Plasmon, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Moreau, Antoine] Univ Clermont Ferrand, Clermont Univ, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Moreau, Antoine] CNRS, IP, UMR 6602, F-63171 Aubiere, France; [Hill, Ryan T.; Chilkoti, Ashutosh] Duke Univ, Ctr Biol Inspired Mat & Mat Syst, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Wang, Qiang; Wiley, Benjamin J.] Duke Univ, Dept Chem, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Wang, Qiang] Capital Normal Univ, Lab Microsized Funct Mat, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China; [Wang, Qiang] Capital Normal Univ, Coll Elementary Educ, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China; [Chilkoti, Ashutosh] Duke Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Smith, DR (reprint author), Duke Univ, Ctr Metamat & Integrated Plasmon, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",drsmith@ee.duke.edu,"Smith, David/E-4710-2012; Moreau, Antoine/C-5790-2009; Wiley, Benjamin/A-7003-2008","Moreau, Antoine/0000-0003-1293-1219; Ciraci, Cristian/0000-0003-3349-8389","US Air Force Office of Scientific Research [FA9550-09-1-0562]; US Army Research Office through a Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative [W911NF-09-1-0539]; US NIH [R21EB009862, F32EB009299]","This work was supported by the US Air Force Office of Scientific Research (grant no.

To fabricate functional nanowire-based devices on an industrial scale requires an efficient methodology that enables the mass production of nanowires with perfect crystallinity, reproducible and controlled dimensions and material composition, and low cost. So far there have been no reports of reliable methods that can satisfy all of these requirements. Here we show how aerotaxy, an aerosol-based growth method(4), can be used to grow nanowires continuously with controlled nanoscale dimensions, a high degree of crystallinity and at a remarkable growth rate. In our aerotaxy approach, catalytic size-selected Au aerosol particles induce nucleation and growth of GaAs nanowires with a growth rate of about 1 micrometre per second, which is 20 to 1,000 times higher than previously reported for traditional, substrate-based growth of nanowires made of group III-V materials(5-7). We demonstrate that the method allows sensitive and reproducible control of the nanowire dimensions and shape-and, thus, controlled optical and electronic properties-through the variation of growth temperature, time and Au particle size. Photoluminescence measurements reveal that even as-grown nanowires have good optical properties and excellent spectral uniformity. Detailed transmission electron microscopy investigations show that our aerotaxy-grown nanowires form along one of the four equivalent < 111 > B crystallographic directions in the zincblende unit cell, which is also the preferred growth direction for III-V nanowires seeded by Au particles on a single-crystal substrate. The reported continuous and potentially high-throughput method can be expected substantially to reduce the cost of producing high-quality nanowires and may enable the low-cost fabrication of nanowire-based devices on an industrial scale.","[Heurlin, Magnus; Lindgren, David; Deppert, Knut; Samuelson, Lars] Lund Univ, Div Solid State Phys, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Magnusson, Martin H.] Sol Volta AB, S-22370 Lund, Sweden; [Ek, Martin; Wallenberg, L.

Advances in transition-metal-mediated cross-coupling have simplified the synthesis of such molecules; however, C-H functionalization of medicinally important heterocycles that does not rely on pre-functionalized starting materials is an underdeveloped area(1-9). Unfortunately, the innate properties of heterocycles that make them so desirable for biological applications-such as aqueous solubility and their ability to act as ligands-render them challenging substrates for direct chemical functionalization. Here we report that zinc sulphinate salts can be used to transfer alkyl radicals to heterocycles, allowing for the mild (moderate temperature, 50 degrees C or less), direct and operationally simple formation of medicinally relevant C-C bonds while reacting in a complementary fashion to other innate C-H functionalization methods(2-6) (Minisci, borono-Minisci, electrophilic aromatic substitution, transition-metal-mediated C-H insertion and C-H deprotonation).

But the mechanisms that create these patterns and control their spatial scales are poorly understood. Theories based on probability(3-5) or optimality(3,6-8) have proven useful(9), but do not explain how river networks develop over time through erosion and sediment transport. Here we show that branching at the uppermost reaches of river networks is rooted in two coupled instabilities: first, valleys widen at the expense of their smaller neighbours, and second, side slopes of the widening valleys become susceptible to channel incision. Each instability occurs at a critical ratio of the characteristic timescales for soil transport and channel incision. Measurements from two field sites demonstrate that our theory correctly predicts the size of the smallest valleys with tributaries. We also show that the dominant control on the scale of landscape dissection in these sites is the strength of channel incision, which correlates with aridity and rock weakness, rather than the strength of soil transport. These results imply that the fine-scale structure of branching river networks is an organized signature of erosional mechanics, not a consequence of random topology.","[Perron, J.

The evolution of neural crest has been proposed to be a key event leading to the appearance of new cell types that fostered the transition from filter feeding to active predation in ancestral vertebrates(3). However, the origin of neural crest remains controversial, as homologous cell types have not been unambiguously identified in non-vertebrate chordates(1,4). Here we show that the tunicate Ciona intestinalis possesses a cephalic melanocyte lineage (a9.49) similar to neural crest that can be reprogrammed into migrating 'ectomesenchyme' by the targeted misexpression of Twist (also known as twist-like 2). Our results suggest that the neural crest melanocyte regulatory network pre-dated the divergence of tunicates and vertebrates.

EZH2 is the catalytic subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and is involved in repressing gene expression through methylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27). EZH2 overexpression is implicated in tumorigenesis and correlates with poor prognosis in several tumour types(1-5). Additionally, somatic heterozygous mutations of Y641 and A677 residues within the catalytic SET domain of EZH2 occur in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma(6-10). The Y641 residue is the most frequently mutated residue, with up to 22% of germinal centre B-cell DLBCL and follicular lymphoma harbouring mutations at this site. These lymphomas have increased H3K27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3) owing to altered substrate preferences of the mutant enzymes(9,11-13). However, it is unknown whether specific, direct inhibition of EZH2 methyltransferase activity will be effective in treating EZH2 mutant lymphomas. Here we demonstrate that GSK126, a potent, highly selective, S-adenosyl-methionine-competitive, small-molecule inhibitor of EZH2 methyltransferase activity, decreases global H3K27me3 levels and reactivates silenced PRC2 target genes. GSK126 effectively inhibits the proliferation of EZH2 mutant DLBCL cell lines and markedly inhibits the growth of EZH2 mutant DLBCL xenografts in mice. Together, these data demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of EZH2 activity may provide a promising treatment for EZH2 mutant lymphoma.","[McCabe, Michael T.; Ott, Heidi M.; Ganji, Gopinath; Korenchuk, Susan; Thompson, Christine; Van Aller, Glenn S.; Liu, Yan; Della Pietra, Anthony, III; LaFrance, Louis V.; Mellinger, Mark; Duquenne, Celine; Tian, Xinrong; Kruger, Ryan G.; McHugh, Charles F.; Miller, William H.; Dhanak, Dashyant; Verma, Sharad K.; Tummino, Peter J.; Creasy, Caretha L.] GlaxoSmithKline, Canc Epigenet Discovery Performance Unit, Canc Res, Oncol R&D, Collegeville, PA 19426 USA; [Graves, Alan P.; Diaz, Elsie; Brandt, Martin] GlaxoSmithKline, Platform Technol & Sci, Collegeville, PA 19426 USA","Creasy, CL (reprint author), GlaxoSmithKline, Canc Epigenet Discovery Performance Unit, Canc Res, Oncol R&D, 1250 S Collegeville Rd, Collegeville, PA 19426 USA.",caretha.l.creasy@gsk.com,,,,,,30,699,715,6,126,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,6-Dec,2012,492,7427,,,,,108,+,,10.1038/nature11606,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,048EQ,WOS:000311893400055,23051747.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,caretha l.,creasy,na,na,na,na,na

Successful colonization by pathogens requires scavenging nutrients, sensing chemical signals, competing with the resident bacteria and precisely regulating the expression of virulence genes(2). The gastrointestinal pathogen enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) relies on inter-kingdom chemical sensing systems to regulate virulence gene expression(3,4). Here we show that these systems control the expression of a novel two-component signal transduction system, named FusKR, where FusK is the histidine sensor kinase and FusR the response regulator. FusK senses fucose and controls expression of virulence and metabolic genes. This fucose-sensing system is required for robust EHEC colonization of the mammalian intestine. Fucose is highly abundant in the intestine(5). Bacteroides theta-iotaomicron produces multiple fucosidases that cleave fucose from host glycans, resulting in high fucose availability in the gut lumen(6). During growth in mucin, B. thetaiotaomicron contributes to EHEC virulence by cleaving fucose from mucin, thereby activating the FusKR signalling cascade, modulating the virulence gene expression of EHEC. Our findings suggest that EHEC uses fucose, a host-derived signal made available by the microbiota, to modulate EHEC pathogenicity and metabolism.","[Pacheco, Alline R.; Curtis, Meredith M.; Moreira, Cristiano G.; Sperandio, Vanessa] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Microbiol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Pacheco, Alline R.; Curtis, Meredith M.; Moreira, Cristiano G.; Sperandio, Vanessa] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Biochem, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Ritchie, Jennifer M.; Munera, Diana; Waldor, Matthew K.] Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Sch Med, Div Infect Dis, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Sperandio, V (reprint author), Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Microbiol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA.",vanessa.sperandio@utsouthwestern.edu,"Moreira, Cristiano/D-8694-2014","Moreira, Cristiano/0000-0002-0689-4119","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [AI053067, AI77853, AI077613]; Burroughs Wellcome Fund; NIH [AI42347, 5 T32 AI7520-14]; HHMI","We thank M.

However, these experiments were performed before the recent discovery of more potent anti-HIV-1 antibodies and their improvement by structure-based design(5-9). Here we re-examine passive antibody transfer as a therapeutic modality in HIV-1-infected humanized mice. Although HIV-1 can escape from antibody monotherapy, combinations of broadly neutralizing antibodies can effectively control HIV-1 infection and suppress viral load to levels below detection. Moreover, in contrast to antiretroviral therapy(10-12), the longer half-life of antibodies led to control of viraemia for an average of 60 days after cessation of therapy.

NLRP3 is a key component of one of several distinct cytoplasmic multiprotein complexes (inflammasomes) that mediate the maturation of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) by activating caspase-1. Although several models for inflammasome activation, such as K+ efflux(2), generation of reactive oxygen species(3) and lysosomal destabilization(4), have been proposed, the precise molecular mechanism of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, as well as the mechanism by which CAPS-associated mutations activate NLRP3, remain to be elucidated. Here we show that the murine calcium-sensing receptor (CASR) activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, mediated by increased intracellular Ca2+ and decreased cellular cyclic AMP(cAMP). Ca2+ or other CASR agonists activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in the absence of exogenous ATP, whereas knockdown of CASR reduces inflammasome activation in response to known NLRP3 activators. CASR activates the NLRP3 inflammasome through phospholipase C, which catalyses inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate production and thereby induces release of Ca2+ from endoplasmic reticulum stores. The increased cytoplasmic Ca2+ promotes the assembly of inflammasome components, and intracellular Ca2+ is required for spontaneous inflammasome activity in cells from patients with CAPS. CASR stimulation also results in reduced intracellular cAMP, which independently activates the NLRP3 inflammasome. cAMP binds to NLRP3 directly to inhibit inflammasome assembly, and downregulation of cAMP relieves this inhibition. The binding affinity of cAMP for CAPS-associated mutant NLRP3 is substantially lower than for wild-type NLRP3, and the uncontrolled mature IL-1 beta production from CAPS patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells is attenuated by increasing cAMP. Taken together, these findings indicate that Ca2+ and cAMP are two key molecular regulators of the NLRP3 inflammasome that have critical roles in the molecular pathogenesis of CAPS.","[Lee, Geun-Shik; Kim, Andrew I.; Aksentijevich, Ivona; Kastner, Daniel L.; Chae, Jae Jin] NHGRI, Inflammatory Dis Sect, Med Genet Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Lee, Geun-Shik] Kangwon Natl Univ, Coll Vet Med, Chunchon 200701, Gangwon, South Korea; [Subramanian, Naeha; Germain, Ronald N.] NIAID, Lab Syst Biol, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Goldbach-Mansky, Raphaela] NIAMSD, Translat Autoinflammatory Dis Sect, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Sacks, David B.] NIH, Dept Lab Med, Ctr Clin, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Kastner, DL (reprint author), NHGRI, Inflammatory Dis Sect, Med Genet Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",kastnerd@mail.nih.gov; chaej@mail.nih.gov,"Goldbach-Mansky, Raphaela/N-5917-2017","Sacks, David/0000-0003-3100-0735","NIAMS; NHGRI; NIAID, NIH","This work was supported by the Intramural Research Programs of the NIAMS, NHGRI, and NIAID, NIH.

Mechanical force from sound waves or head movements is conveyed to hair-cell transduction channels by tip links(2,3), fine filaments formed by two atypical cadherins known as protocadherin 15 and cadherin 23 (refs 4, 5). These two proteins are involved in inherited deafness(6-10) and feature long extracellular domains that interact tip-to-tip(5,11) in a Ca2+-dependent manner. However, the molecular architecture of this complex is unknown. Here we combine crystallography, molecular dynamics simulations and binding experiments to characterize the protocadherin 15-cadherin 23 bond. We find a unique cadherin interaction mechanism, in which the two most amino-terminal cadherin repeats (extracellular cadherin repeats 1 and 2) of each protein interact to form an overlapped, antiparallel heterodimer. Simulations predict that this tip-link bond is mechanically strong enough to resist forces in hair cells. In addition, the complex is shown to become unstable in response to Ca2+ removal owing to increased flexure of Ca2+-free cadherin repeats. Finally, we use structures and biochemical measurements to study the molecular mechanisms by which deafness mutations disrupt tip-link function. Overall, our results shed light on the molecular mechanics of hair-cell sensory transduction and on new interaction mechanisms for cadherins, a large protein family implicated in tissue and organ morphogenesis(12,13), neural connectivity(14) and cancer(15).","[Sotomayor, Marcos; Corey, David P.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Sotomayor, Marcos; Corey, David P.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Weihofen, Wilhelm A.; Gaudet, Rachelle] Harvard Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Corey, DP (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",gaudet@mcb.harvard.edu; dcorey@hms.harvard.edu,"Sotomayor, Marcos/J-4898-2012; Gaudet, Rachelle/I-4133-2014","Sotomayor, Marcos/0000-0002-3333-1805; Gaudet, Rachelle/0000-0002-9177-054X; Corey, David/0000-0003-4497-6016","NIH [R01 DC02281, RC2GM093307, RR-15301]; National Science Foundation through TeraGrid/XSEDE [TRAC MCB080015]; Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC02-06CH11357]; DOE [DE-AC02-05CH11231]","We thank B.

To address this, here we solve crystal structures of two different classes of cobalamin (vitamin B-12)-binding riboswitches that include the structural switch of the downstream regulatory domain. These classes share a common cobalamin-binding core, but use distinct peripheral extensions to recognize different B12 derivatives. In each case, recognition is accomplished through shape complementarity between the RNA and cobalamin, with relatively few hydrogen bonding interactions that typically govern RNA-small molecule recognition. We show that a composite cobalamin-RNA scaffold stabilizes an unusual long-range intramolecular kissing-loop interaction that controls mRNA expression. This is the first, to our knowledge, riboswitch crystal structure detailing how the receptor and regulatory domains communicate in a ligand-dependent fashion to regulate mRNA expression.","[Johnson, James E., Jr.; Reyes, Francis E.; Polaski, Jacob T.; Batey, Robert T.] Univ Colorado, Dept Chem & Biochem, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","Batey, RT (reprint author), Univ Colorado, Dept Chem & Biochem, UCB 596, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",francis.reyes@colorado.edu; robert.batey@colorado.edu,"Batey, Robert/A-8265-2009","Batey, Robert/0000-0002-1384-6625","National Institutes of Health [GM073850, 1S10RR026516]; Colorado Diversity Initiative Fellowship; NIH Ruth L.

Additionally, certain iridoids are used as sex pheromones in agriculturally important species of aphids, a fact that has underpinned innovative and integrated pest management strategies(5). To harness the biotechnological potential of this natural product class, the enzymes involved in the biosynthetic pathway must be elucidated. Here we report the discovery of iridoid synthase, a plant-derived enzyme that generates the iridoid ring scaffold, as evidenced by biochemical assays, gene silencing, co-expression analysis and localization studies. In contrast to all known monoterpene cyclases, which use geranyl diphosphate as substrate and invoke a cationic intermediate, iridoid synthase uses the linear monoterpene 10-oxogeranial as substrate and probably couples an initial NAD(P) H-dependent reduction step with a subsequent cyclization step via a Diels-Alder cycloaddition or a Michael addition. Our results illustrate how a short-chain reductase was recruited as cyclase for the production of iridoids in medicinal plants. Furthermore, we highlight the prospects of using unrelated reductases to generate artificial cyclic scaffolds. Beyond the recognition of an alternative biochemical mechanism for the biosynthesis of cyclic terpenes, we anticipate that our work will enable the large-scale heterologous production of iridoids in plants and microorganisms for agricultural(5-8) and pharmaceutical(1-4,9) applications.","[Geu-Flores, Fernando; Sherden, Nathaniel H.; Glenn, Weslee S.; O'Connor, Sarah E.] John Innes Ctr Plant Sci Res, Dept Biol Chem, Norwich NR4 7UH, Norfolk, England; [Courdavault, Vincent] Univ Tours, Biomol & Biotechnol Vegetales EA2106, F-37200 Tours, France; [Burlat, Vincent] Univ Toulouse, UPS, UMR 5546, Lab Rech Sci Vegetales, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France; [Burlat, Vincent] CNRS, UMR 5546, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France; [Glenn, Weslee S.; Nims, Ezekiel] MIT, Dept Chem, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Wu, Cen; Cui, Yuehua] Michigan State Univ, Dept Stat & Probabil, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [O'Connor, Sarah E.] Univ E Anglia, Sch Chem, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England","O'Connor, SE (reprint author), John Innes Ctr Plant Sci Res, Dept Biol Chem, Norwich NR4 7UH, Norfolk, England.",sarah.o'connor@jic.ac.uk,"burlat, vincent/J-6831-2015; Geu-Flores, Fernando/B-2737-2015","burlat, vincent/0000-0002-0897-6011; Geu-Flores, Fernando/0000-0002-5735-9810; Courdavault, Vincent/0000-0001-8902-4532; O'Connor, Sarah/0000-0003-0356-6213",Danish Council for Independent Research (Natural Sciences) [10-082858]; NIH [GM074820]; John Innes Foundation; National Science Foundation; NSF [DMS-1209112]; John Innes Centre; University of East Anglia;  [j004561SRC (BB/J004561/1)];  [BB/J009091/1],"The present study was funded by the Danish Council for Independent Research (Natural Sciences) through Postdoctoral Fellowship 10-082858 granted to F.G.-F.

The chemistry of ocean floor basalts, the most accessible product of this magmatism, is studied for the insights it yields into the compositional heterogeneity of the mantle and its thermal structure. However, before eruption, parental magma compositions are modified at crustal pressures by a process that has usually been assumed to be fractional crystallization. Here we show that the global distributions of trace elements in ocean floor basalts describe a systematic pattern that cannot be explained by simple fractional crystallization alone, but is due to cycling of magma through the global ensemble of magma chambers. Variability in both major and incompatible trace-element contents about the average global pattern is due to fluctuations in the magma fluxes into and out of the chambers, and their depth, as well as to differences in the composition of the parental magmas.","[O'Neill, Hugh St C.; Jenner, Frances E.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Canberra, ACT 2600, Australia; [Jenner, Frances E.] Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Terr Magnetism, Washington, DC 20015 USA","O'Neill, HS (reprint author), Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 2600, Australia.",hugh.oneill@anu.edu.au,"O'Neill, Hugh/G-2302-2011","O'Neill, Hugh/0000-0001-7018-9783",Australian National University,"This work was funded by the Australian National University.

Major efforts are underway worldwide to increase wheat production by extending genetic diversity and analysing key traits, and genomic resources can accelerate progress. But so far the very large size and polyploid complexity of the bread wheat genome have been substantial barriers to genome analysis. Here we report the sequencing of its large, 17-gigabase-pair, hexaploid genome using 454 pyrosequencing, and comparison of this with the sequences of diploid ancestral and progenitor genomes. We identified between 94,000 and 96,000 genes, and assigned two-thirds to the three component genomes (A, B and D) of hexaploid wheat. High-resolution synteny maps identified many small disruptions to conserved gene order. We show that the hexaploid genome is highly dynamic, with significant loss of gene family members on polyploidization and domestication, and an abundance of gene fragments. Several classes of genes involved in energy harvesting, metabolism and growth are among expanded gene families that could be associated with crop productivity. Our analyses, coupled with the identification of extensive genetic variation, provide a resource for accelerating gene discovery and improving this major crop.","[McKenzie, Neil; Waite, Darren; Trick, Martin; Bancroft, Ian; Bevan, Michael W.] John Innes Ctr Plant Sci Res, Norwich NR4 7UH, Norfolk, England; [Brenchley, Rachel; D'Amore, Rosalinda; Kay, Suzanne; Hall, Anthony; Hall, Neil] Univ Liverpool, Ctr Genome Res, Liverpool L69 7ZB, Merseyside, England; [Spannagl, Manuel; Pfeifer, Matthias; Mayer, Klaus F.

It is diploid with a large haploid genome of 5.1 gigabases (Gb). Here we present an integrated and ordered physical, genetic and functional sequence resource that describes the barley gene-space in a structured whole-genome context. We developed a physical map of 4.98 Gb, with more than 3.90 Gb anchored to a high-resolution genetic map. Projecting a deep whole-genome shotgun assembly, complementary DNA and deep RNA sequence data onto this framework supports 79,379 transcript clusters, including 26,159 'high-confidence' genes with homology support from other plant genomes. Abundant alternative splicing, premature termination codons and novel transcriptionally active regions suggest that post-transcriptional processing forms an important regulatory layer. Survey sequences from diverse accessions reveal a landscape of extensive single-nucleotide variation.

Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are an abundant population of innate-like T cells in humans that are activated by an antigen(s) bound to the MHC class I-like molecule MR1. Although the identity of MR1-restricted antigen(s) is unknown, it is present in numerous bacteria and yeast. Here we show that the structure and chemistry within the antigen-binding cleft of MR1 is distinct from the MHC and CD1 families. MR1 is ideally suited to bind ligands originating from vitamin metabolites. The structure of MR1 in complex with 6-formyl pterin, a folic acid (vitamin B9) metabolite, shows the pterin ring sequestered within MR1. Furthermore, we characterize related MR1-restricted vitamin derivatives, originating from the bacterial riboflavin (vitamin B2) biosynthetic pathway, which specifically and potently activate MAIT cells. Accordingly, we show that metabolites of vitamin B represent a class of antigen that are presented by MR1 for MAIT-cell immunosurveillance. As many vitamin biosynthetic pathways are unique to bacteria and yeast, our data suggest that MAIT cells use these metabolites to detect microbial infection.","[Kjer-Nielsen, Lars; Corbett, Alexandra J.; Meehan, Bronwyn; Chen, Zhenjun; Kostenko, Lyudmila; Reantragoon, Rangsima; Godfrey, Dale I.; McCluskey, James] Univ Melbourne, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Patel, Onisha; Le Nours, Jerome; Bhati, Mugdha; Purcell, Anthony W.; Dudek, Nadine L.; Rossjohn, Jamie] Monash Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Sch Biomed Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Le Nours, Jerome; Rossjohn, Jamie] Monash Univ, Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Struct & Funct Microbial Genom, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Liu, Ligong; Fairlie, David P.] Univ Queensland, Div Chem & Struct Biol, Inst Mol Biosci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Williamson, Nicholas A.; Purcell, Anthony W.; Dudek, Nadine L.; McConville, Malcolm J.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Metabol Australia, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Williamson, Nicholas A.; Purcell, Anthony W.; Dudek, Nadine L.; McConville, Malcolm J.] Univ Melbourne, Mol Sci & Biotechnol Inst Bio21, Metabol Australia, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [O'Hair, Richard A.

The RNA structural transitions that have been characterized so far involve long-lived species that can be captured by structure characterization techniques. Here we report the nuclear magnetic resonance visualization of RNA transitions towards 'invisible' excited states (ESs), which exist in too little abundance (2-13%) and for too short a duration (45-250 ms) to allow structural characterization by conventional techniques. Transitions towards ESs result in localized rearrangements in base-pairing that alter building block elements of RNA architecture, including helix-junction-helix motifs and apical loops. The ES can inhibit function by sequestering residues involved in recognition and signalling or promote ATP-independent strand exchange. Thus, RNAs do not adopt a single conformation, but rather exist in rapid equilibrium with alternative ESs, which can be stabilized by cellular cues to affect functional outcomes.","[Dethoff, Elizabeth A.; Petzold, Katja; Chugh, Jeetender; Casiano-Negroni, Anette; Al-Hashimi, Hashim M.] Univ Michigan, Dept Chem & Biophys, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Al-Hashimi, HM (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Dept Chem & Biophys, 930 N Univ Ave, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",hashimi@umich.edu,"Petzold, Katja/E-9816-2011; Petzold, Katja/M-7298-2015","Petzold, Katja/0000-0001-9470-0347; Petzold, Katja/0000-0001-9470-0347; Chugh, Jeetender/0000-0002-9996-5202",Michigan Economic Development Cooperation; Michigan Technology Tri-Corridor; Swedish Research Council [VR-K2011-78PK-21662-0-12]; US National Institutes of Health [R01 Al066975]; University of Michigan,"E.A.D., K.P. and J.C contributed equally to this work.

Several explanations have been proposed for the existence of these locally established empirical relationships, including the non-causal, statistical process of galaxy-galaxy merging(2), direct feedback between the black hole and its host galaxy(3), and galaxy-galaxy merging and the subsequent violent relaxation and dissipation(4). The empirical scaling relations are therefore important for distinguishing between various theoretical models of galaxy evolution(5,6), and they furthermore form the basis for all black-hole mass measurements at large distances. Observations have shown that the mass of the black hole is typically 0.1 per cent of the mass of the stellar bulge of the galaxy(7,8). Until now, the galaxy with the largest known fraction of its mass in its central black hole (11 per cent) was the small galaxy NGC 4486B(1,9). Here we report observations of the stellar kinematics of NGC 1277, which is a compact, lenticular galaxy with a mass of 1.2 x 10(11) solar masses. From the data, we determine that the mass of the central black hole is 1.7 x 10(10) solar masses, or 59 per cent of its bulge mass. We also show observations of five other compact galaxies that have properties similar to NGC 1277 and therefore may also contain over-massive black holes. It is not yet known if these galaxies represent a tail of a distribution, or if disk-dominated galaxies fail to follow the usual black-hole mass scaling relations(4,10).","[van den Bosch, Remco C.

Numerical models reproduce the tropospheric conditions very well but have trouble explaining the observed middle-atmosphere temperatures, composition and winds(1,2). The top of the middle-atmosphere circulation has been thought to lie at an altitude of 450 to 500 kilometres, where there is a layer of haze that appears to be separated from the main haze deck(3). This 'detached' haze was previously explained as being due to the co-location of peak haze production and the limit of dynamical transport by the circulation's upper branch(4). Here we report a build-up of trace gases over the south pole approximately two years after observing the 2009 post-equinox circulation reversal, from which we conclude that middle-atmosphere circulation must extend to an altitude of at least 600 kilometres. The primary drivers of this circulation are summer-hemisphere heating of haze by absorption of solar radiation and winter-hemisphere cooling due to infrared emission by haze and trace gases(5); our results therefore imply that these effects are important well into the thermosphere (altitudes higher than 500 kilometres). This requires both active upper-atmosphere chemistry, consistent with the detection of high-complexity molecules and ions at altitudes greater than 950 kilometres(6,7), and an alternative explanation for the detached haze, such as a transition in haze particle growth from monomers to fractal structures(8).","[Teanby, Nicholas A.; Sefton-Nash, Elliot] Univ Bristol, Sch Earth Sci, Bristol BS8 1RJ, Avon, England; [Irwin, Patrick G.

Although measuring the particle flow in liquid helium or superconducting materials is essential to identify superfluidity or superconductivity, no analogous measurement has been performed for superfluids based on ultracold Fermi gases. Here we report direct measurements of the conduction properties of strongly interacting fermions, observing the well-known drop in resistance that is associated with the onset of superfluidity. By varying the depth of the trapping potential in a narrow channel connecting two atomic reservoirs, we observed variations of the atomic current over several orders of magnitude. We related the intrinsic conduction properties to the thermodynamic functions in a model-independent way, by making use of high-resolution in situ imaging in combination with current measurements. Our results show that, as in solid-state systems, current and resistance measurements in quantum gases provide a sensitive probe with which to explore many-body physics. Our method is closely analogous to the operation of a solid-state field-effect transistor and could be applied as a probe for optical lattices and disordered systems, paving the way for modelling complex superconducting devices.","[Stadler, David; Krinner, Sebastian; Meineke, Jakob; Brantut, Jean-Philippe; Esslinger, Tilman] ETH, Inst Quantum Elect, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland","Brantut, JP (reprint author), ETH, Inst Quantum Elect, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",brantutj@phys.ethz.ch; esslinger@phys.ethz.ch,"Brantut, Jean-Philippe/G-2793-2013; Esslinger, Tilman/M-9022-2016","Esslinger, Tilman/0000-0002-8333-107X",NCCR MaNEP and QSIT; ERC,"We acknowledge discussions with W.

But however complex the crystal might be, this energy landscape is of parabolic shape near its minima. Roughly speaking, the depth of this energy well with respect to some reference level determines the thermodynamic stability of the system, and the steepness of the parabola near its minimum determines the system's elastic properties. Although changing alloying elements and their concentrations in a given material to enhance certain properties dates back to the Bronze Age(1,2), the systematic search for desirable properties in metastable atomic configurations at a fixed stoichiometry is a very recent tool in materials design(3). Here we demonstrate, using first-principles studies of four binary alloy systems, that the elastic properties of face-centred-cubic intermetallic compounds obey certain rules. We reach two conclusions based on calculations on a huge subset of the face-centred-cubic configuration space. First, the stiffness and the heat of formation are negatively correlated with a nearly constant Spearman correlation(4) for all concentrations. Second, the averaged stiffness of metastable configurations at a fixed concentration decays linearly with their distance to the ground-state line (the phase diagram of an alloy at zero Kelvin). We hope that our methods will help to simplify the quest for new materials with optimal properties from the vast configuration space available.","[Maisel, Sascha B.; Hoefler, Michaela; Mueller, Stefan] Hamburg Univ Technol, Inst Adv Ceram, D-21073 Hamburg, Germany","Maisel, SB (reprint author), Hamburg Univ Technol, Inst Adv Ceram, Denickestr 15, D-21073 Hamburg, Germany.",stefan.mueller@tuhh.de,"Maisel, Sascha/I-3559-2015","Maisel, Sascha/0000-0002-7603-371X",DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) [Mu1648/5],Funding by the DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) grant Mu1648/5 is acknowledged.

Highly resolved and continuous sea-level records are essential for quantifying ice-volume changes. However, an unbiased study of the timing of past ice-volume changes, relative to polar climate change, has so far been impossible because available sea-level records either were dated by using orbital tuning or ice-core timescales, or were discontinuous in time. Here we present an independent dating of a continuous, high-resolution sea-level record(1,2) in millennial-scale detail throughout the past 150,000 years. We find that the timing of ice-volume fluctuations agrees well with that of variations in Antarctic climate and especially Greenland climate. Amplitudes of ice-volume fluctuations more closely match Antarctic (rather than Greenland) climate changes. Polar climate and ice-volume changes, and their rates of change, are found to covary within centennial response times. Finally, rates of sea-level rise reached at least 1.2 m per century during all major episodes of ice-volume reduction.","[Grant, K. M.; Rohling, E.

However, their evolutionary origins are much debated. Placoderms comprise an extinct sister clade(3) or grade(4,5) to the clade containing chondrichthyans and osteichthyans, and although they clearly possess jaws, previous studies have suggested that they lack teeth(6-8), that they possess convergently evolved tooth-like structures(9-11) or that they possess true teeth(12). Here we use synchrotron radiation X-ray tomographic microscopy (SRXTM)(13) of a developmental series of Compagopiscis croucheri (Arthrodira) to show that placoderm jaws are composed of distinct cartilages and gnathal ossifications in both jaws, and a dermal element in the lower jaw. The gnathal ossification is a composite of distinct teeth that developed in succession, polarized along three distinct vectors, comparable to tooth families. The teeth are composed of dentine and bone, and show a distinct pulp cavity that is infilled centripetally as development proceeds. This pattern is repeated in other placoderms, but differs from the structure and development of tooth-like structures in the postbranchial lamina and dermal skeleton of Compagopiscis and other placoderms. We interpret this evidence to indicate that Compagopiscis and other arthrodires possessed teeth, but that tooth and jaw development was not developmentally or structurally integrated in placoderms. Teeth did not evolve convergently among the extant and extinct classes of early jawed vertebrates but, rather, successional teeth evolved within the gnathostome stem-lineage soon after the origin of jaws. The chimaeric developmental origin of this model of modularity reflects the distinct evolutionary origins of teeth and of component elements of the jaws.","[Ruecklin, Martin; Donoghue, Philip C.

One primary cause of productivity loss and plant mortality during drought is hydraulic failure(2-4). Drought stress creates trapped gas emboli in the water transport system, which reduces the ability of plants to supply water to leaves for photosynthetic gas exchange and can ultimately result in desiccation and mortality. At present we lack a clear picture of how thresholds to hydraulic failure vary across a broad range of species and environments, despite many individual experiments. Here we draw together published and unpublished data on the vulnerability of the transport system to drought-induced embolism for a large number of woody species, with a view to examining the likely consequences of climate change for forest biomes. We show that 70% of 226 forest species from 81 sites worldwide operate with narrow (<1 megapascal) hydraulic safety margins against injurious levels of drought stress and therefore potentially face long-term reductions in productivity and survival if temperature and aridity increase as predicted for many regions across the globe(5,6). Safety margins are largely independent of mean annual precipitation, showing that there is global convergence in the vulnerability of forests to drought, with all forest biomes equally vulnerable to hydraulic failure regardless of their current rainfall environment. These findings provide insight into why drought-induced forest decline is occurring not only in arid regions but also in wet forests not normally considered at drought risk(7,8).","[Jansen, Steven] Ulm Univ, Inst Systemat Bot & Ecol, D-89081 Ulm, Germany; [Choat, Brendan] Univ Western Sydney, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Richmond, NSW 2753, Australia; [Brodribb, Tim J.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Plant Sci, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Cochard, Herve] INRA, PIAF UMR547, F-63100 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Delzon, Sylvain] Univ Bordeaux, INRA, UMR BIOGECO, F-33450 Talence, France; [Bhaskar, Radika] Brown Univ, Environm Change Initiat, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Bucci, Sandra J.] Univ Nacl Patagonia San Juan Bosco, Dept Biol, Fac Ciencias Nat, RA-9000 Comodoro Rivadavia, Argentina; [Feild, Taylor S.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Gleason, Sean M.; Westoby, Mark; Wright, Ian J.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia; [Hacke, Uwe G.] Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E3, Canada; [Jacobsen, Anna L.; Pratt, R.

The naturally hybridizing collared flycatcher and pied flycatcher are important avian speciation models(2-7) that show pre- as well as postzygotic isolation(8,9). We sequenced and assembled the 1.1-Gb flycatcher genome, physically mapped the assembly to chromosomes using a low-density linkage map(10) and re-sequenced population samples of each species. Here we show that the genomic landscape of species differentiation is highly heterogeneous with approximately 50 'divergence islands' showing up to 50-fold higher sequence divergence than the genomic background. These non-randomly distributed islands, with between one and three regions of elevated divergence per chromosome irrespective of chromosome size, are characterized by reduced levels of nucleotide diversity, skewed allele-frequency spectra, elevated levels of linkage disequilibrium and reduced proportions of shared polymorphisms in both species, indicative of parallel episodes of selection. Proximity of divergence peaks to genomic regions resistant to sequence assembly, potentially including centromeres and telomeres, indicate that complex repeat structures may drive species divergence. A much higher background level of species divergence of the Z chromosome, and a lower proportion of shared polymorphisms, indicate that sex chromosomes and autosomes are at different stages of speciation. This study provides a roadmap to the emerging field of speciation genomics.","[Ellegren, Hans; Smeds, Linnea; Burri, Reto; Olason, Pall I.; Backstrom, Niclas; Kawakami, Takeshi; Kunstner, Axel; Makinen, Hannu; Nadachowska-Brzyska, Krystyna; Uebbing, Severin; Wolf, Jochen B.

One particular spatial representation, that of grid cells, has been observed in the entorhinal cortex (EC) of rats and bats(3-5), but has yet to be described in single units in primates. Here we examined spatial representations in the EC of head-fixed monkeys performing a free-viewing visual memory task(6,7). Individual neurons were identified in the primate EC that emitted action potentials when the monkey fixated multiple discrete locations in the visual field in each of many sequentially presented complex images. These firing fields possessed spatial periodicity similar to a triangular tiling with a corresponding well-defined hexagonal structure in the spatial auto-correlation. Further, these neurons showed theta-band oscillatory activity and changing spatial scale as a function of distance from the rhinal sulcus, which is consistent with previous findings in rodents(4,8-10). These spatial representations may provide a framework to anchor the encoding of stimulus content in a complex visual scene. Together, our results provide a direct demonstration of grid cells in the primate and suggest that EC neurons encode space during visual exploration, even without locomotion.","[Killian, Nathaniel J.; Jutras, Michael J.; Buffalo, Elizabeth A.] Yerkes Natl Primate Res Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA; [Killian, Nathaniel J.] Georgia Inst Technol, Wallace H Coulter Dept Biomed Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Buffalo, Elizabeth A.] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA","Buffalo, EA (reprint author), Yerkes Natl Primate Res Ctr, 954 Gatewood Rd, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA.",elizabeth.buffalo@emory.edu,,"Killian, Nathaniel/0000-0002-4546-0516","National Institute of Mental Health [R01MH093807, R01MH080007, MH082559]; National Center for Research Resources [P51RR165]; Office of Research Infrastructure Programs/OD [P51OD11132]; NSF IGERT program [DGE-0333411]","We thank S.

To this end, the stepwise differentiation of stem cells into specialized derivatives has been successful for some cell types(1-3), but a major problem remains the inefficient conversion of cells from one stage of differentiation to the next. If specialized cells are to be produced in large numbers it will be necessary to expand progenitor cells, without differentiation, at some steps of the process. Using the pancreatic lineage as a model for embryonic-stem-cell differentiation, we demonstrate that this is a solvable problem. Co-culture with organ-matched mesenchyme permits proliferation and self-renewal of progenitors, without differentiation, and enables an expansion of more than a million-fold for human endodermal cells with full retention of their developmental potential. This effect is specific both to the mesenchymal cell and to the progenitor being amplified. Progenitors that have been serially expanded on mesenchyme give rise to glucose-sensing, insulin-secreting cells when transplanted in vivo. Theoretically, the identification of stage-specific renewal signals can be incorporated into any scheme for the efficient production of large numbers of differentiated cells from stem cells and may therefore have wide application in regenerative biology.","[Sneddon, Julie B.; Borowiak, Malgorzata; Melton, Douglas A.] Harvard Univ, Dept Stem Cell & Regenerat Biol, Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Melton, DA (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Stem Cell & Regenerat Biol, Harvard Stem Cell Inst, 7 Divin Ave, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",dmelton@harvard.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health [5 U42 RR006042-20, K08 DK084206]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Leona M. and Harry B.

We tested the hypothesis that the pathogenesis of HSE involves non-haematopoietic CNS-resident cells. We derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from the dermal fibroblasts of TLR3- and UNC-93B-deficient patients and from controls. These iPSCs were differentiated into highly purified populations of neural stem cells (NSCs), neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. The induction of interferon-beta (IFN-beta) and/or IFN-lambda 1 in response to stimulation by the dsRNA analogue polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) was dependent on TLR3 and UNC-93B in all cells tested. However, the induction of IFN-beta and IFN-lambda 1 in response to HSV-1 infection was impaired selectively in UNC-93B-deficient neurons and oligodendrocytes. These cells were also much more susceptible to HSV-1 infection than control cells, whereas UNC-93B-deficient NSCs and astrocytes were not. TLR3-deficient neurons were also found to be susceptible to HSV-1 infection. The rescue of UNC-93B- and TLR3-deficient cells with the corresponding wild-type allele showed that the genetic defect was the cause of the poly(I:C) and HSV-1 phenotypes. The viral infection phenotype was rescued further by treatment with exogenous IFN-alpha or IFN-beta (IFN-alpha/beta) but not IFN-lambda 1. Thus, impaired TLR3- and UNC-93B-dependent IFN-alpha/beta intrinsic immunity to HSV-1 in the CNS, in neurons and oligodendrocytes in particular, may underlie the pathogenesis of HSE in children with TLR3-pathway deficiencies.","[Zhang, Shen-Ying; Ciancanelli, Michael J.; Herman, Melina; Abhyankar, Avinash; Abel, Laurent; Casanova, Jean-Laurent] Rockefeller Univ, St Giles Lab Human Genet Infect Dis, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Lafaille, Fabien G.; Studer, Lorenz] Sloan Kettering Inst Canc Res, Ctr Stem Cell Biol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Lafaille, Fabien G.; Studer, Lorenz] Sloan Kettering Inst Canc Res, Dev Biol Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Pessach, Itai M.; Ordovas-Montanes, Jose; Notarangelo, Luigi D.] Harvard Univ, Childrens Hosp, Div Immunol, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Pessach, Itai M.] Chaim Sheba Med Ctr, Talpiot Med Leadership Program, Edmond & Lily Safra Childrens Hosp, IL-52621 Tel Hashomer, Israel; [Pessach, Itai M.] Tel Aviv Univ, Sackler Fac Med, IL-52621 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Zhang, Shen-Ying; Herman, Melina; Jouanguy, Emmanuelle; Abel, Laurent; Casanova, Jean-Laurent] Univ Paris 05, Lab Human Genet Infect Dis, Inst Natl Sante & Rech Med, Necker Med Sch,U980, F-75015 Paris, France; [Ying, Shui-Wang; Goldstein, Peter A.] Weill Cornell Med Coll, CV Starr Lab Mol Neuropharmacol, Dept Anesthesiol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Keros, Sotirios] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Div Pediat Neurol, Dept Pediat, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Mostoslavsky, Gustavo] Boston Univ, Sch Med, Sect Gastroenterol, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02118 USA; [Elkabetz, Yechiel] Tel Aviv Univ, Lab Pluripotent & Neural Stem Cell Biol, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Sackler Sch Med, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Al-Muhsen, Saleh] King Saud Univ, Prince Naif Ctr Immunol Res, Dept Pediat, Coll Med, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia; [Tardieu, Marc] Hop Bicetre, Assistance Publ Hop Paris, Dept Pediat Neurol, F-94275 Le Kremlin Bicetre, France; [Schlaeger, Thorsten M.; Daley, George Q.] Childrens Hosp, Div Pediat Hematol Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Schlaeger, Thorsten M.; Daley, George Q.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Casanova, Jean-Laurent] Hop Necker Enfants Malad, Pediat Hematol Immunol Unit, F-75015 Paris, France; [Notarangelo, Luigi D.] Childrens Hosp, Manton Ctr Orphan Dis Res, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Zhang, SY (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, St Giles Lab Human Genet Infect Dis, New York, NY 10065 USA.",shzh289@rockefeller.edu; jean-laurent.casanova@rockefeller.edu,"; Notarangelo, Luigi/F-9718-2016; Gouel-Plancoulaine, Sabine/E-2824-2017; Jouanguy, Emmanuelle/H-7901-2017; Zhang, Shen-Ying/I-2685-2017","Ordovas-Montanes, Jose/0000-0001-5444-5601; Goldstein, Peter/0000-0002-5973-9104; Casanova, Jean-Laurent/0000-0002-7782-4169; Notarangelo, Luigi/0000-0002-8335-0262; Jouanguy, Emmanuelle/0000-0002-7358-9157; Zhang, Shen-Ying/0000-0002-9449-3672; Ciancanelli, Michael/0000-0002-4623-852X; Casadio, Melina/0000-0003-2389-2243; Abel, Laurent/0000-0001-7016-6493; Plancoulaine, Sabine/0000-0003-0725-8306","National Center for Translational Sciences (NCATS) [8UL1TR000043]; National Institutes of Health (NIH); Rockefeller University; St. Giles Foundation; ANR; INSERM; Paris Descartes University; March of Dimes; NIH [5R01NS072381-02, 1R03AI0883502-01, 1R01NS066390]; Manton Foundation; Israeli Centers of Research Excellence (I-CORE); Gene Regulation in Complex Human Disease [41/11]; New York Stem Cell Foundation","We thank our patients, their families and physicians; and the members of the three laboratories for helpful discussions and critical reading of this manuscript.

The long-term consequences for the host of interactions with these microbial species can range from mutualism to parasitism and are not always completely understood. The potential effect of one microbial symbiont on another is even less clear. Here we study the control of ERVs in the commonly used C57BL/6 (B6) mouse strain, which lacks endogenous murine leukaemia viruses (MLVs) able to replicate in murine cells. We demonstrate the spontaneous emergence of fully infectious ecotropic(4) MLV in B6 mice with a range of distinct immune deficiencies affecting antibody production. These recombinant retroviruses establish infection of immunodeficient mouse colonies, and ultimately result in retrovirus-induced lymphomas. Notably, ERV activation in immunodeficient mice is prevented in husbandry conditions associated with reduced or absent intestinal microbiota.

IL-8, released in response to inflammatory stimuli, binds to the extracellular side of CXCR1. The ligand-activated intracellular signalling pathways result in neutrophil migration to the site of inflammation(2). CXCR1 is a class A, rhodopsin-like G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), the largest class of integral membrane proteins responsible for cellular signal transduction and targeted as drug receptors(4-7). Despite its importance, the molecular mechanism of CXCR1 signal transduction is poorly understood owing to the limited structural information available. Recent structural determination of GPCRs has advanced by modifying the receptors with stabilizing mutations, insertion of the protein T4 lysozyme and truncations of their amino acid sequences(8), as well as addition of stabilizing antibodies and small molecules(9) that facilitate crystallization in cubic phase monoolein mixtures(10). The intracellular loops of GPCRs are crucial for G-protein interactions(11), and activation of CXCR1 involves both amino-terminal residues and extracellular loops(2,12,13). Our previous nuclear magnetic resonance studies indicate that IL-8 binding to the N-terminal residues is mediated by the membrane, underscoring the importance of the phospholipid bilayer for physiological activity(14). Here we report the three-dimensional structure of human CXCR1 determined by NMR spectroscopy. The receptor is in liquid crystalline phospholipid bilayers, without modification of its amino acid sequence and under physiological conditions. Features important for intracellular G-protein activation and signal transduction are revealed. The structure of human CXCR1 in a lipid bilayer should help to facilitate the discovery of new compounds that interact with GPCRs and combat diseases such as breast cancer.","[Park, Sang Ho; Das, Bibhuti B.; Casagrande, Fabio; Tian, Ye; Nothnagel, Henry J.; Chu, Mignon; Opella, Stanley J.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Chem & Biochem, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Tian, Ye; Marassi, Francesca M.] Sanford Burnham Med Res Inst, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Kiefer, Hans] HBC Hsch Biberach, D-88400 Biberach, Germany; [Maier, Klaus; De Angelis, Anna A.] Membrane Receptor Technol, San Diego, CA 92121 USA","Opella, SJ (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Chem & Biochem, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",sopella@ucsd.edu,,"Kiefer, Hans/0000-0002-8574-9867","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R01EB005161, R01GM075877, R21GM94727, R21GM075917, P01AI074805, P41EB002031]; Swiss National Science Foundation [PBBSP3-123151]; Novartis Foundation","This research was supported by grants R01EB005161, R01GM075877, R21GM94727, R21GM075917, P01AI074805 and P41EB002031 from the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Sulphate-coupled AOM is believed to be mediated by a consortium of methanotrophic archaea (ANME) and sulphate-reducing Deltaproteobacteria but the underlying mechanism has not yet been resolved. Here we show that zero-valent sulphur compounds (S-0) are formed during AOM through a new pathway for dissimilatory sulphate reduction performed by the methanotrophic archaea. Hence, AOM might not be an obligate syntrophic process but may be carried out by the ANME alone. Furthermore, we show that the produced S-0-in the form of disulphide-is disproportionated by the Deltaproteobacteria associated with the ANME. Our observations expand the diversity of known microbially mediated sulphur transformations and have significant implications for our understanding of the biogeochemical carbon and sulphur cycles.","[Milucka, Jana; Ferdelman, Timothy G.; Polerecky, Lubos; Franzke, Daniela; Wegener, Gunter; Widdel, Friedrich; Kuypers, Marcel M.

Although hippocampal ripples have been studied in detail using neurophysiological methods, the global effects of ripples on the entire brain remain elusive, primarily owing to a lack of methodologies permitting concurrent hippocampal recordings and whole-brain activity mapping. By combining electrophysiological recordings in hippocampus with ripple-triggered functional magnetic resonance imaging, here we show that most of the cerebral cortex is selectively activated during the ripples, whereas most diencephalic, midbrain and brainstem regions are strongly and consistently inhibited. Analysis of regional temporal response patterns indicates that thalamic activity suppression precedes the hippocampal population burst, which itself is temporally bounded by massive activations of association and primary cortical areas. These findings suggest that during off-line memory consolidation, synergistic thalamocortical activity may be orchestrating a privileged interaction state between hippocampus and cortex by silencing the output of subcortical centres involved in sensory processing or potentially mediating procedural learning. Such a mechanism would cause minimal interference, enabling consolidation of hippocampus-dependent memory.","[Logothetis, N. K.; Eschenko, O.; Murayama, Y.; Augath, M.; Steudel, T.; Evrard, H.

Foxp3 operates as a late-acting differentiation factor controlling T-reg cell homeostasis and function(5), whereas the early T-reg-cell-lineage commitment is regulated by the Akt kinase and the forkhead box O (Foxo) family of transcription factors(6-10). However, whether Foxo proteins act beyond the T-reg-cell-commitment stage to control T-reg cell homeostasis and function remains largely unexplored. Here we show that Foxo1 is a pivotal regulator of T-reg cell function. T-reg cells express high amounts of Foxo1 and display reduced T-cell-receptor-induced Akt activation, Foxo1 phosphorylation and Foxo1 nuclear exclusion. Mice with T-reg-cell-specific deletion of Foxo1 develop a fatal inflammatory disorder similar in severity to that seen in Foxp3-deficient mice, but without the loss of T-reg cells. Genome-wide analysis of Foxo1 binding sites reveals similar to 300 Foxo1-bound target genes, including the pro-inflammatory cytokine Ifng, that do not seem to be directly regulated by Foxp3. These findings show that the evolutionarily ancient Akt-Foxo1 signalling module controls a novel genetic program indispensable for T-reg cell function.","[Ouyang, Weiming; Luo, Chong T.; Yin, Na; Huse, Morgan; Kim, Myoungjoo V.; Peng, Min; Chan, Pamela; Ma, Qian; Rudensky, Alexander Y.; Li, Ming O.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Program Immunol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Liao, Will; Mo, Yifan; Atwal, Gurinder] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; [Liao, Will; Mo, Yifan] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Appl Math & Stat, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Luo, Chong T.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Louis V Gerstner Jr Grad Sch Biomed Sci, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Meijer, Dies] Erasmus Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Cell Biol & Genet, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Zhao, Keji] NHLBI, Syst Biol Ctr, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Rudensky, Alexander Y.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Zhang, Michael Q.] Univ Texas Dallas, Ctr Syst Biol, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Richardson, TX 75080 USA; [Zhang, Michael Q.] Tsinghua Univ, TNLIST, Ctr Synthet & Syst Biol, Bioinformat Div, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China","Li, MO (reprint author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Program Immunol, New York, NY 10065 USA.",mzhang@cshl.edu; lim@mskcc.org,"Peng, Min/O-3770-2017","Peng, Min/0000-0002-5885-0660; Luo, Chong/0000-0002-3477-5969",Starr Cancer Consortium [13-A123]; Rita Allen Foundation; National Bio Resource Project (NBRPC) [2012CB316503]; National Institutes of Health [HG001696],"We thank R.

Pluto possesses an atmosphere whereas Eris does not; the difference probably arises from their differing distances from the Sun, and explains their different albedos(3). Makemake is another icy dwarf planet with a spectrum similar to Eris and Pluto(4), and is currently at a distance to the Sun intermediate between the two. Although Makemake's size (1,420 +/- 60 km) and albedo are roughly known(5,6), there has been no constraint on its density and there were expectations that it could have a Pluto-like atmosphere(4,7,8). Here we report the results from a stellar occultation by Makemake on 2011 April 23. Our preferred solution that fits the occultation chords corresponds to a body with projected axes of 1,430 +/- 9 km (1 sigma) and 1,502 +/- 45 km, implying a V-band geometric albedo p(V) = 0.77 +/- 0.03. This albedo is larger than that of Pluto, but smaller than that of Eris. The disappearances and reappearances of the star were abrupt, showing that Makemake has no global Pluto-like atmosphere at an upper limit of 4-12 nano-bar (1 sigma) for the surface pressure, although a localized atmosphere is possible.

Their potential fully unfolds at ultracold temperatures, where various effects are predicted in many-body physics(1,2), quantum information science(3,4), ultracold chemistry(5,6) and physics beyond the standard model(7,8). Whereas a wide range of methods to produce cold molecular ensembles have been developed(9-13), the cooling of polyatomic molecules (that is, with three or more atoms) to ultracold temperatures has seemed intractable. Here we report the experimental realization of optoelectrical cooling(14), a recently proposed cooling and accumulation method for polar molecules. Its key attribute is the removal of a large fraction of a molecule's kinetic energy in each cycle of the cooling sequence via a Sisyphus effect, allowing cooling with only a few repetitions of the dissipative decay process. We demonstrate the potential of optoelectrical cooling by reducing the temperature of about one million CH3F molecules by a factor of 13.5, with the phase-space density increased by a factor of 29 (or a factor of 70 discounting trap losses). In contrast to other cooling mechanisms, our scheme proceeds in a trap, cools in all three dimensions and should work for a large variety of polar molecules. With no fundamental temperature limit anticipated down to the photon-recoil temperature in the nanokelvin range, we expect our method to be able to produce ultracold polyatomic molecules. The low temperatures, large molecule numbers and long trapping times of up to 27 seconds should allow an interaction-dominated regime to be attained, enabling collision studies and investigation of evaporative cooling towards a Bose-Einstein condensate of polyatomic molecules.","[Zeppenfeld, Martin; Englert, Barbara G.

The resulting plasmons have enhanced optical fields of a specific colour tightly confined inside the gap. Many emerging nanophotonic technologies depend on the careful control of this plasmonic coupling, including optical nanoantennas for high-sensitivity chemical and biological sensors(1), nanoscale control of active devices(2-4), and improved photovoltaic devices(5). But for subnanometre gaps, coherent quantum tunnelling becomes possible and the system enters a regime of extreme non-locality in which previous classical treatments(6-14) fail. Electron correlations across the gap that are driven by quantum tunnelling require a new description of non-local transport, which is crucial in nanoscale optoelectronics and single-molecule electronics. Here, by simultaneously measuring both the electrical and optical properties of two gold nanostructures with controllable subnanometre separation, we reveal the quantum regime of tunnelling plasmonics in unprecedented detail. All observed phenomena are in good agreement with recent quantum-based models of plasmonic systems(15), which eliminate the singularities predicted by classical theories. These findings imply that tunnelling establishes a quantum limit for plasmonic field confinement of about 10(-8) lambda(3) for visible light (of wavelength lambda). Our work thus prompts new theoretical and experimental investigations into quantum-domain plasmonic systems, and will affect the future of nanoplasmonic device engineering and nanoscale photochemistry.","[Savage, Kevin J.; Hawkeye, Matthew M.; Baumberg, Jeremy J.] Univ Cambridge, Cavendish Lab, Nanophoton Ctr, Cambridge CB3 0HE, England; [Esteban, Ruben; Borisov, Andrei G.; Aizpurua, Javier] Mat Phys Ctr CSIC UPV EHU, Donostia San Sebastian 20018, Spain; [Esteban, Ruben; Borisov, Andrei G.; Aizpurua, Javier] Donostia Int Phys Ctr DIPC, Donostia San Sebastian 20018, Spain; [Borisov, Andrei G.] Univ Paris 11, CNRS, UMR 8214, Inst Sci Mol Orsay, F-91405 Orsay, France","Baumberg, JJ (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Cavendish Lab, Nanophoton Ctr, Cambridge CB3 0HE, England.",jjb12@cam.ac.uk,"Borisov, Andrei/D-1554-2010; Esteban, Ruben/B-9669-2014; Aizpurua, Javier/E-6889-2014; DONOSTIA INTERNATIONAL PHYSICS CTR., DIPC/C-3171-2014; CSIC-UPV/EHU, CFM/F-4867-2012","Aizpurua, Javier/0000-0002-1444-7589; ","EPSRC [EP/G060649/1, EP/H007024/1]; EU grant CUBi-HOLE; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [FIS2010-19609-C02-01, EUI200803816]; Ikerbasque Foundation; Jesus College Cambridge; University of Cambridge; Canadian NSERC post-doctoral fellowship","This work was supported by EPSRC grants EP/G060649/1 and EP/H007024/1, EU grant CUBi-HOLE, and projects FIS2010-19609-C02-01 and EUI200803816 from the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation.

Our understanding of self-assembly has evolved independently in the fields of chemistry and materials, and with a few notable exceptions(3,4) has focused on equilibrium rather than dynamical systems. Here we combine these two phenomena to create synchronization-selected microtubes of Janus colloids, micron-sized spherical particles with different surface chemistry on their opposing hemispheres, which we study using imaging and computer simulation. A thin nickel film coats one hemisphere of each silica particle to generate a discoid magnetic symmetry, such that in a precessing magnetic field its dynamics retain crucial phase freedom. Synchronizing their motion, these Janus spheres self-organize into micrometre-scale tubes in which the constituent particles rotate and oscillate continuously. In addition, the microtube must be tidally locked to the particles, that is, the particles must maintain their orientation within the rotating microtube. This requirement leads to a synchronization-induced structural transition that offers various applications based on the potential to form, disintegrate and fine-tune self-assembled in-motion structures in situ. Furthermore, it offers a generalizable method of controlling structure using dynamic synchronization criteria rather than static energy minimization, and of designing new field-driven microscale devices in which components do not slavishly follow the external field.","[Bloom, Moses; Luijten, Erik] Northwestern Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Yan, Jing; Bae, Sung Chul; Granick, Steve] Univ Illinois, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Luijten, Erik] Northwestern Univ, Dept Engn Sci & Appl Math, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Granick, Steve] Univ Illinois, Dept Phys, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Granick, Steve] Univ Illinois, Dept Chem, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Luijten, E (reprint author), Northwestern Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",luijten@northwestern.edu; sgranick@uiuc.edu,"Bae, Sung/A-3423-2008; Luijten, Erik/E-3899-2010","Bae, Sung/0000-0002-9765-6801; Luijten, Erik/0000-0003-2364-1866","US Army Research Office [W911NF-10-1-0518]; National Science Foundation [DMR-1006430, CBET-0853737]; US Department of Energy, Division of Materials Science through Frederick Seitz Materials Research Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign [DE-FG02-07ER46471]","This work was supported by the US Army Research Office, grant award number W911NF-10-1-0518 (Y.J., S.

Historically, hydrophobic hydration shells were thought to resemble solid clathrate hydrates(2-4), with solutes surrounded by polyhedral cages composed of tetrahedrally hydrogen-bonded water molecules. But more recent experimental(5-8) and theoretical(9-16) studies have challenged this view and emphasized the importance of the length scales involved. Here we report combined polarized, isotopic and temperature-dependent Raman scattering measurements with multivariate curve resolution (Raman-MCR)(17-19) that explore hydrophobic hydration by mapping the vibrational spectroscopic features arising from the hydrophobic hydration shells of linear alcohols ranging from methanol to heptanol. Our data, covering the entire 0-100 degrees C temperature range, show clear evidence that at low temperatures the hydration shells have a hydrophobically enhanced water structure with greater tetrahedral order and fewer weak hydrogen bonds than the surrounding bulk water. This structure disappears with increasing temperature and is then, for hydrophobic chains longer than similar to 1 nm, replaced by a more disordered structure with weaker hydrogen bonds than bulk water. These observations support our current understanding of hydrophobic hydration, including the thermally induced water structural transformation that is suggestive of the hydrophobic crossover predicted to occur at lengths of similar to 1 nm (refs 5, 9, 10, 14).","[Davis, Joel G.; Gierszal, Kamil P.; Wang, Ping; Ben-Amotz, Dor] Purdue Univ, Dept Chem, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Ben-Amotz, D (reprint author), Purdue Univ, Dept Chem, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",bendor@purdue.edu,,,National Science Foundation [CHE-0847928],"This work was supported by the National Science Foundation (CHE-0847928).

Time-varying rates of mass loss(2,4-6) contribute to this, but substantial technique-specific systematic errors also exist(3). In particular, estimates of secular ice-mass change derived from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data are dominated by significant uncertainty in the accuracy of models of mass change due to glacial isostatic adjustment(7,8) (GIA). Here we adopt a new model of GIA, developed from geological constraints, which produces GIA rates systematically lower than those of previous models, and an improved fit to independent uplift data(9). After applying the model to 99 months (from August 2002 to December 2010) of GRACE data, we estimate a continent-wide ice-mass change of -69 +/- 18 Gt yr(-1) (+0.19 +/- 0.05 mm yr(-1) sea-level equivalent). This is about a third to a half of the most recently published GRACE estimates(2,5), which cover a similar time period but are based on older GIA models. Plausible GIA model uncertainties, and errors relating to removing longitudinal GRACE artefacts ('destriping'), confine our estimate to the range -126 Gt yr(-1) to -29 Gt yr(-1) (0.08-0.35 mm yr(-1) sea-level equivalent). We resolve 26 independent drainage basins and find that Antarctic mass loss, and its acceleration, is concentrated in basins along the Amundsen Sea coast. Outside this region, we find that West Antarctica is nearly in balance and that East Antarctica is gaining substantial mass.","[King, Matt A.; Bingham, Rory J.; Moore, Phil] Newcastle Univ, Sch Civil Engn & Geosci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [King, Matt A.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Geog & Environm Studies, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Whitehouse, Pippa L.; Bentley, Michael J.] Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Durham DH1 3LE, England; [Milne, Glenn A.] Univ Ottawa, Dept Earth Sci, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada","King, MA (reprint author), Newcastle Univ, Sch Civil Engn & Geosci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",m.a.king@newcastle.ac.uk,"Bentley, Michael/F-7386-2011; King, Matt/B-4622-2008","Bentley, Michael/0000-0002-2048-0019; King, Matt/0000-0001-5611-9498; Whitehouse, Pippa/0000-0002-9092-3444",NERC; RCUK Academic Fellowship; COST Action [ES0701]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Canada Research Chairs programme,"This work was funded by NERC, and an RCUK Academic Fellowship to M.

But there is debate as to when cultural and cognitive characteristics typical of modern humans first appeared, and the role that these had in the expansion of modern humans out of Africa(3). Scientists rely on symbolically specific proxies, such as artistic expression, to document the origins of complex cognition. Advanced technologies with elaborate chains of production are also proxies, as these often demand high-fidelity transmission and thus language. Some argue that advanced technologies in Africa appear and disappear and thus do not indicate complex cognition exclusive to early modern humans in Africa(3,4). The origins of composite tools and advanced projectile weapons figure prominently in modern human evolution research, and the latter have been argued to have been in the exclusive possession of modern humans(5,6). Here we describe a previously unrecognized advanced stone tool technology from Pinnacle Point Site 5-6 on the south coast of South Africa, originating approximately 71,000 years ago. This technology is dominated by the production of small bladelets (microliths) primarily from heat-treated stone. There is agreement that microlithic technology was used to create composite tool components aspart of advanced projectile weapons(7,8). Microliths were common worldwide by the mid-Holocene epoch, but have a patchy pattern of first appearance that is rarely earlier than 40,000 years ago(9,10), and were thought to appear briefly between 65,000 and 60,000 years ago in South Africa and then disappear. Our research extends this record to similar to 71,000 years, shows that microlithic technology originated early in South Africa, evolved over a vast time span (similar to 11,000 years), and was typically coupled to complex heat treatment that persisted for nearly 100,000 years. Advanced technologies in Africa were early and enduring; a small sample of excavated sites in Africa is the best explanation for any perceived 'flickering' pattern.","[Brown, Kyle S.; Marean, Curtis W.; Schoville, Benjamin J.; Oestmo, Simen; Fisher, Erich C.; Bernatchez, Jocelyn] Arizona State Univ, Sch Human Evolut & Social Change, Inst Human Origins, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Brown, Kyle S.] Univ Cape Town, Dept Archaeol, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Jacobs, Zenobia] Univ Wollongong, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Ctr Archaeol Sci, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; [Karkanas, Panagiotis] Ephoreia Palaeoanthropol Speleol So Greece, Athens 11636, Greece; [Matthews, Thalassa] Iziko S African Museum, Dept Nat Hist, ZA-8000 Cape Town, South Africa","Marean, CW (reprint author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Human Evolut & Social Change, Inst Human Origins, POB 872402, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",curtis.marean@asu.edu,"Karkanas, Panagiotis/F-7762-2011","Karkanas, Panagiotis/0000-0002-7156-671X; Matthews, Thalassa/0000-0002-0176-5596; Oestmo, Simen/0000-0002-9662-4904; Schoville, Benjamin/0000-0002-0124-7959","National Science Foundation [BCS-9912465, BCS-0130713, BCS-0524087, BCS-1138073]; Hyde Family Foundation; Institute of Human Origins (IHO); Australian Research Council [DP1092843]","We thank the MAPCRM staff for their assistance, the Dias Museum for field facilities, and SAHRA and HWC for permits.

Changes in day-length, shift-work, and transmeridian travel lead to mood alterations and cognitive function deficits(2). Sleep deprivation and circadian disruption underlie mood and cognitive disorders associated with irregular light schedules(2). Whether irregular light schedules directly affect mood and cognitive functions in the context of normal sleep and circadian rhythms remains unclear. Here we show, using an aberrant light cycle that neither changes the amount and architecture of sleep nor causes changes in the circadian timing system, that light directly regulates mood-related behaviours and cognitive functions in mice. Animals exposed to the aberrant light cycle maintain daily corticosterone rhythms, but the overall levels of corticosterone are increased. Despite normal circadian and sleep structures, these animals show increased depression-like behaviours and impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation and learning. Administration of the antidepressant drugs fluoxetine or desipramine restores learning in mice exposed to the aberrant light cycle, suggesting that the mood deficit precedes the learning impairments. To determine the retinal circuits underlying this impairment of mood and learning, we examined the behavioural consequences of this light cycle in animals that lack intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells. In these animals, the aberrant light cycle does not impair mood and learning, despite the presence of the conventional retinal ganglion cells and the ability of these animals to detect light for image formation. These findings demonstrate the ability of light to influence cognitive and mood functions directly through intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells.","[LeGates, Tara A.; Altimus, Cara M.; Zhao, Haiqing; Hattar, Samer] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Biol, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Wang, Hui; Lee, Hey-Kyoung; Yang, Sunggu; Kirkwood, Alfredo; Hattar, Samer] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Neurosci, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Weber, E.

Decades of theoretical studies have proposed that spines may function as highly effective and modifiable chemical and electrical compartments that regulate synaptic efficacy, integration and plasticity(3-8). Experimental studies have confirmed activity-dependent structural dynamics and biochemical compartmentalization by spines(9-12). However, there is a longstanding debate over the influence of spines on the electrical aspects of synaptic transmission and dendritic operation(3-8,13-18). Here we measure the amplitude ratio of spine head to parent dendrite voltage across a range of dendritic compartments and calculate the associated spine neck resistance (R-neck) for spines at apical trunk dendrites in rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. We find that R-neck is large enough (similar to 500M Omega) to amplify substantially the spine head depolarization associated with a unitary synaptic input by similar to 1.5- to similar to 45-fold, depending on parent dendritic impedance. A morphologically realistic compartmental model capable of reproducing the observed spatial profile of the amplitude ratio indicates that spines provide a consistently high-impedance input structure throughout the dendritic arborization. Finally, we demonstrate that the amplification produced by spines encourages electrical interaction among coactive inputs through an R-neck-dependent increase in spine head voltage-gated conductance activation. We conclude that the electrical properties of spines promote nonlinear dendritic processing and associated forms of plasticity and storage, thus fundamentally enhancing the computational capabilities of neurons(19-21).","[Harnett, Mark T.; Makara, Judit K.; Spruston, Nelson; Magee, Jeffrey C.] HHMI Janelia Farm Res Campus, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA; [Makara, Judit K.] Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Expt Med, H-1083 Budapest, Hungary; [Kath, William L.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Appl Math, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Kath, William L.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Neurobiol, Evanston, IL 60208 USA","Magee, JC (reprint author), HHMI Janelia Farm Res Campus, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA.",mageej@janelia.hhmi.org,"Kath, William/B-6771-2009","Spruston, Nelson/0000-0003-3118-1636","Howard Hughes Medical Institute; National Institutes of Health [NS-046064, NS-077601]; Wellcome Trust [090915]","We thank A.

It is therefore plausible that diseases whose manifestations correlate with ageing might be connected to the appearance of nuclear aberrations over time. We decided to evaluate nuclear organization in the context of ageing-associated disorders by focusing on a leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) dominant mutation (G2019S; glycine-to-serine substitution at amino acid 2019), which is associated with familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease as well as impairment of adult neurogenesis in mice(5). Here we report on the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from Parkinson's disease patients and the implications of LRRK2 (G2019S) mutation in human neural-stem-cell (NSC) populations. Mutant NSCs showed increased susceptibility to proteasomal stress as well as passage-dependent deficiencies in nuclear-envelope organization, clonal expansion and neuronal differentiation. Disease phenotypes were rescued by targeted correction of the LRRK2 (G2019S) mutation with its wild-type counterpart in Parkinson's disease iPSCs and were recapitulated after targeted knock-in of the LRRK2(G2019S) mutation in human embryonic stem cells. Analysis of human brain tissue showed nuclear-envelope impairment in clinically diagnosed Parkinson's disease patients. Together, our results identify the nucleus as a previously unknown cellular organelle in Parkinson's disease pathology and may help to open new avenues for Parkinson's disease diagnoses as well as for the potential development of therapeutics targeting this fundamental cell structure.","[Liu, Guang-Hui; Qu, Jing; Suzuki, Keiichiro; Nivet, Emmanuel; Li, Mo; Yi, Fei; Ruiz, Sergio; Goebl, April; Kim, Jessica; Soligalla, Rupa Devi; Dubova, Ilir; Esteban, Concepcion Rodriguez; Sancho-Martinez, Ignacio; Izpisua Belmonte, Juan Carlos] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Gene Express Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Liu, Guang-Hui; Qu, Jing; Xu, Xiuling; Zhang, Weiqi; Li, Ying] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Biophys, Natl Lab Biomacromol, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Montserrat, Nuria; Izpisua Belmonte, Juan Carlos] Ctr Regenerat Med Barcelona, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Wagner, Ulrich; Kim, Audrey; Ren, Bing] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Ludwig Inst Canc Res, Dept Cellular & Mol Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Thompson, James; Yates, John, III] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Cell Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Belmonte, JCI (reprint author), Salk Inst Biol Studies, Gene Express Lab, 10010 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",ghliu@ibp.ac.cn; belmonte@salk.edu,"Nivet, Emmanuel/C-2729-2014; Li, Mo/J-2090-2014; Montserrat, Nuria/F-3136-2016; Ruiz, Sergio/G-1561-2016","Nivet, Emmanuel/0000-0001-7903-4059; Montserrat, Nuria/0000-0002-1603-1755; Ruiz, Sergio/0000-0002-0177-6965; Sancho-Martinez, Ignacio/0000-0003-4348-1038","Thousand Young Talents program of China; National Laboratory of Biomacromolecules; Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [81271266, 31222039]; Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation; AFAR/Ellison Medical Foundation; Uehara Memorial Foundation; F.M.

The interdependent functions of regulators of mitochondrial homeostasis and enzymes responsible for haem synthesis are largely unknown. To investigate this we used zebrafish genetic screens and cloned mitochondrial ATPase inhibitory factor 1 (atpif1) from a zebrafish mutant with profound anaemia, pinotage (pnt (tq209)). Here we describe a direct mechanism establishing that Atpif1 regulates the catalytic efficiency of vertebrate Fech to synthesize haem. The loss of Atpif1 impairs haemoglobin synthesis in zebrafish, mouse and human haematopoietic models as a consequence of diminished Fech activity and elevated mitochondrial pH. To understand the relationship between mitochondrial pH, redox potential, [2Fe-2S] clusters and Fech activity, we used genetic complementation studies of Fech constructs with or without [2Fe-2S] clusters in pnt, as well as pharmacological agents modulating mitochondrial pH and redox potential. The presence of [2Fe-2S] cluster renders vertebrate Fech vulnerable to perturbations in Atpif1-regulated mitochondrial pH and redox potential. Therefore, Atpif1 deficiency reduces the efficiency of vertebrate Fech to synthesize haem, resulting in anaemia. The identification of mitochondrial Atpif1 as a regulator of haem synthesis advances our understanding of the mechanisms regulating mitochondrial haem homeostasis and red blood cell development. An ATPIF1 deficiency may contribute to important human diseases, such as congenital sideroblastic anaemias and mitochondriopathies.","[Shah, Dhvanit I.; Cooney, Jeffrey D.; Schultz, Iman J.; Pierce, Eric L.; Narla, Anupama; Langer, Nathaniel B.; Hurst, Slater N.; Heggers, Spencer K.; Vogin, Guillaume; Chen, Wen; Chen, Caiyong; Ebert, Benjamin L.; Paw, Barry H.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med,Div Hematol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Takahashi-Makise, Naoko; Li, Liangtao; Seguin, Alexandra; Ward, Diane M.; Kaplan, Jerry] Univ Utah, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Salt Lake City, UT 84312 USA; [Narla, Anupama; Hattangadi, Shilpa M.; Paw, Barry H.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston Childrens Hosp, Dept Med,Div Hematol Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Hattangadi, Shilpa M.] Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Hattangadi, Shilpa M.] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Medlock, Amy E.; Dailey, Tamara A.; Dailey, Harry A.] Univ Georgia, Dept Microbiol, Biomed & Hlth Sci Inst, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Medlock, Amy E.; Dailey, Tamara A.; Dailey, Harry A.] Univ Georgia, Dept Biochem, Biomed & Hlth Sci Inst, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Medlock, Amy E.; Dailey, Tamara A.; Dailey, Harry A.] Univ Georgia, Dept Mol Biol, Biomed & Hlth Sci Inst, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Faccenda, Danilo; Campanella, Michelangelo] Univ London Royal Vet Coll, London NW1 0TU, England; [Faccenda, Danilo; Campanella, Michelangelo] UCL, Consortium Mitochondrial Res, London NW1 0TU, England; [Wiwczar, Jessica M.; Danial, Nika N.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Campagna, Dean R.; Fleming, Mark D.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston Childrens Hosp, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Brugnara, Carlo] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston Childrens Hosp, Dept Lab Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Paw, BH (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med,Div Hematol, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",hdailey@uga.edu; jerry.kaplan@path.utah.edu; bpaw@rics.bwh.harvard.edu,,"Medlock, Amy/0000-0001-9402-3593; Paw, Barry/0000-0002-0492-1419",Cooley's Anemia Foundation; March of Dimes Foundation; American Heart Association; Dutch National Science Fund; Fondation Soldati pour la Recherche en Cancerologie; Burroughs Welcome Fund; NIDDK; NHLBI,"We thank members of our laboratory (M.

Inhibitors of IgE-Fc epsilon RI binding have been identified and an anti-IgE therapeutic antibody (omalizumab) is used to treat severe allergic asthma(3,4). However, preformed IgE-Fc epsilon RI complexes that prime cells before allergen exposure dissociate extremely slowly(5) and cannot be disrupted by strictly competitive inhibitors. IgE-Fc conformational flexibility indicated that inhibition could be mediated by allosteric or other non-classical mechanisms(6-8). Here we demonstrate that an engineered protein inhibitor, DARPin E2_79 (refs 9-11), acts through a non-classical inhibition mechanism, not only blocking IgE-Fc epsilon RI interactions, but actively stimulating the dissociation of preformed ligand-receptor complexes. The structure of the E2_79-IgE-Fc(3-4) complex predicts the presence of two non-equivalent E2_79 sites in the asymmetric IgE-Fc epsilon RI complex, with site 1 distant from the receptor and site 2 exhibiting partial steric overlap. Although the structure is indicative of an allosteric inhibition mechanism, mutational studies and quantitative kinetic modelling indicate that E2_79 acts through a facilitated dissociation mechanism at site 2 alone. These results demonstrate that high-affinity IgE-Fc epsilon RI complexes can be actively dissociated to block the allergic response and suggest that protein-protein complexes may be more generally amenable to active disruption by macromolecular inhibitors.","[Kim, Beomkyu; Tarchevskaya, Svetlana S.; Jardetzky, Theodore S.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Struct, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Eggel, Alexander; Vogel, Monique] Univ Bern, Inst Immunol, CH-3010 Bern, Switzerland; [Prinz, Heino] Max Planck Inst Mol Physiol, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany","Jardetzky, TS (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Struct, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",tjardetz@stanford.edu,,"Eggel, Alexander/0000-0001-8746-3339",NIH [AI-18939]; American Asthma Foundation; Swiss National Science Foundation [310030_127350],"We thank B.

CUL3 was also found associated with the BTB-ZF transcription factor BCL6, which directs the germinal-centre B cell and follicular T-helper cell programs. Conditional CUL3 deletion in mice demonstrated an essential role for CUL3 in the development of PLZF- and BCL6-dependent lineages. We conclude that distinct lineage-specific BTB-ZF transcription factors recruit CUL3 to alter the ubiquitination pattern of their associated chromatin-modifying complex. We propose that this new function is essential to direct the differentiation of several T- and B-cell effector programs, and may also be involved in the oncogenic role of PLZF and BCL6 in leukaemias and lymphomas(8,9).","[Mathew, Rebecca; Seiler, Michael P.; Scanlon, Seth T.; Mao, Ai-ping; Constantinides, Michael G.; Bertozzi-Villa, Clara; Bendelac, Albert] Univ Chicago, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Pathol, Comm Immunol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Singer, Jeffrey D.] Portland State Univ, Dept Biol, Portland, OR 97207 USA","Bendelac, A (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Pathol, Comm Immunol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",abendela@bsd.uchicago.edu,"Mathew, Rebecca/H-7154-2013","Scanlon, Seth Thomas/0000-0002-1792-6382; Constantinides, Michael/0000-0003-4770-7751","National Institute of Health (NIH) [5RO1GM082940, RO1AI038339]; Irvington Institute postdoctoral fellowship from the Cancer Research Institute","We thank A.

Cytosolic citrate further regulates the energy balance of the cell by activating the fatty-acid-synthesis pathway while downregulating both the glycolysis and fatty-acid beta-oxidation pathways(1-4). The rate of fatty-acid synthesis in liver and adipose cells, the two main tissue types for such synthesis, correlates directly with the concentration of citrate in the cytosol(2-5), with the cytosolic citrate concentration partially depending on direct import across the plasma membrane through the Na+-dependent citrate transporter (NaCT)(6,7). Mutations of the homologous fly gene (Indy; I'm not dead yet) result in reduced fat storage through calorie restriction(8). More recently, Nact (also known as Slc13a5)-knockout mice have been found to have increased hepatic mitochondrial biogenesis, higher lipid oxidation and energy expenditure, and reduced lipogenesis, which taken together protect the mice from obesity and insulin resistance(9). To understand the transport mechanism of NaCT and INDY proteins, here we report the 3.2 angstrom crystal structure of a bacterial INDY homologue. One citrate molecule and one sodium ion are bound per protein, and their binding sites are defined by conserved amino acid motifs, forming the structural basis for understanding the specificity of the transporter. Comparison of the structures of the two symmetrical halves of the transporter suggests conformational changes that propel substrate translocation.","[Mancusso, Romina; Gregorio, G.

From domestication to modern breeding practices, humans have shaped the genomes of domestic pigs. Here we present the assembly and analysis of the genome sequence of a female domestic Duroc pig (Sus scrofa) and a comparison with the genomes of wild and domestic pigs from Europe and Asia. Wild pigs emerged in South East Asia and subsequently spread across Eurasia. Our results reveal a deep phylogenetic split between European and Asian wild boars similar to 1 million years ago, and a selective sweep analysis indicates selection on genes involved in RNA processing and regulation. Genes associated with immune response and olfaction exhibit fast evolution. Pigs have the largest repertoire of functional olfactory receptor genes, reflecting the importance of smell in this scavenging animal. The pig genome sequence provides an important resource for further improvements of this important livestock species, and our identification of many putative disease-causing variants extends the potential of the pig as a biomedical model.","[Groenen, Martien A.

We performed exome sequencing and copy number analysis to define genomic aberrations in a prospectively accrued clinical cohort (n=142) of early (stage I and II) sporadic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Detailed analysis of 99 informative tumours identified substantial heterogeneity with 2,016 non-silent mutations and 1,628 copy-number variations. We define 16 significantly mutated genes, reaffirming known mutations (KRAS, TP53, CDKN2A, SMAD4, MLL3, TGFBR2, ARID1A and SF3B1), and uncover novel mutated genes including additional genes involved in chromatin modification (EPC1 and ARID2), DNA damage repair (ATM) and other mechanisms (ZIM2, MAP2K4, NALCN, SLC16A4 and MAGEA6). Integrative analysis with in vitro functional data and animal models provided supportive evidence for potential roles for these genetic aberrations in carcinogenesis. Pathway-based analysis of recurrently mutated genes recapitulated clustering in core signalling pathways in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and identified new mutated genes in each pathway. We also identified frequent and diverse somatic aberrations in genes described traditionally as embryonic regulators of axon guidance, particularly SLIT/ROBO signalling, which was also evident in murine Sleeping Beauty transposon-mediated somatic mutagenesis models of pancreatic cancer, providing further supportive evidence for the potential involvement of axon guidance genes in pancreatic carcinogenesis.","[Waddell, Nicola; Kassahn, Karin S.; Miller, David K.; Wilson, Peter J.; Patch, Ann-Marie; Gardiner, Brooke B.; Song, Sarah; Harliwong, Ivon; Idrisoglu, Senel; Nourse, Craig; Nourbakhsh, Ehsan; Manning, Suzanne; Wani, Shivangi; Gongora, Milena; Anderson, Matthew; Holmes, Oliver; Leonard, Conrad; Taylor, Darrin; Wood, Scott; Xu, Qinying; Nones, Katia; Fink, J.

Here we report an HIV-1 gp41 membrane-proximal external region (MPER)-specific antibody, named 10E8, which neutralizes similar to 98% of tested viruses. An analysis of sera from 78 healthy HIV-1-infected donors demonstrated that 27% contained MPER-specific antibodies and 8% contained 10E8-like specificities. In contrast to other neutralizing MPER antibodies, 10E8 did not bind phospholipids, was not autoreactive, and bound cell-surface envelope. The structure of 10E8 in complex with the complete MPER revealed a site of vulnerability comprising a narrow stretch of highly conserved gp41-hydrophobic residues and a critical arginine or lysine just before the transmembrane region. Analysis of resistant HIV-1 variants confirmed the importance of these residues for neutralization. The highly conserved MPER is a target of potent, non-self-reactive neutralizing antibodies, suggesting that HIV-1 vaccines should aim to induce antibodies to this region of HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein.","[Huang, Jinghe; Laub, Leo; Imamichi, Hiromi; Migueles, Stephen A.; Connors, Mark] NIAID, HIV Specif Immun Sect, Immunoregulat Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Ofek, Gilad; Louder, Mark K.; Doria-Rose, Nicole A.; Longo, Nancy S.; Bailer, Robert T.; Wang, Tao; Yang, Yongping; Zhang, Baoshan; Kwong, Peter D.; Mascola, John R.] NIAID, Vaccine Res Ctr, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Chakrabarti, Bimal; Sharma, Shailendra K.; Wyatt, Richard] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Immunol & Microbial Sci, IAVI Neutralizing Antibody Ctr, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Alam, S.

The highly intertwined structure illustrates why chemical activity depends on formation of the synaptic complex, and reveals that individual domains have different roles when bound to different sites. The structure also provides explanations for the increased stability of the final product complex and for its preferential recognition by the ATP-dependent unfoldase ClpX.

Recently, observations of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect(2) during planetary transits have revealed that a considerable fraction of hot Jupiters are on orbits that are misaligned with respect to the spin axes of their host stars(3). This observation has cast doubt on the importance of disk-driven migration as a mechanism for producing hot Jupiters. Here I show that misaligned orbits can be a natural consequence of disk migration in binary systems whose orbital plane is uncorrelated with the spin axes of the individual stars(4-6). The gravitational torques arising from the dynamical evolution of idealized proto-planetary disks under perturbations from massive distant bodies act to misalign the orbital planes of the disks relative to the spin poles of their host stars. As a result, I suggest that in the absence of strong coupling between the angular momentum of the disk and that of the host star, or of sufficient dissipation that acts to realign the stellar spin axis and the planetary orbits, the fraction of planetary systems (including systems of 'hot Neptunes' and 'super-Earths') whose angular momentum vectors are misaligned with respect to their host stars will be commensurate with the rate of primordial stellar multiplicity.","[Batygin, Konstantin] CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Batygin, Konstantin] Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Inst Theory & Computat, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Batygin, K (reprint author), CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",kbatygin@gps.caltech.edu,,,,,,29,102,102,0,7,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Nov,2012,491,7424,,,,,418,420,,10.1038/nature11560,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,036MY,WOS:000311031600040,23151584.0,No,,,11/20/17,konstantin,batygin,male,1,66,04fDAYsAAAAJ,2083

Electron spins in III-V semiconductor quantum dots are among the matter qubits that allow for the fastest spin manipulation(6,7) and photon emission(8,9), but entanglement between a single quantum-dot spin qubit and a flying (propagating) photonic qubit has yet to be demonstrated. Moreover, many quantum dots emit single photons at visible to near-infrared wavelengths, where silica fibre losses are so high that long-distance quantum communication protocols become difficult to implement(10). Here we demonstrate entanglement between an InAs quantum-dot electron spin qubit and a photonic qubit, by frequency downconversion of a spontaneously emitted photon from a singly charged quantum dot to a wavelength of 1,560 nanometres. The use of sub-10-picosecond pulses at a wavelength of 2.2 micrometres in the frequency downconversion process provides the necessary quantum erasure to eliminate which-path information in the photon energy. Together with previously demonstrated indistinguishable single-photon emission at high repetition rates(11,12), the present technique advances the III-V semiconductor quantum-dot spin system as a promising platform for long-distance quantum communication.","[De Greve, Kristiaan; Yu, Leo; McMahon, Peter L.; Pelc, Jason S.; Natarajan, Chandra M.; Kim, Na Young; Abe, Eisuke; Hoefling, Sven; Fejer, M.

Particularly in the context of quantum networks and communication, a main challenge is the efficient generation of entanglement between stationary (spin) and propagating (photon) quantum bits(2). Here we report the observation of quantum entanglement between a semiconductor quantum dot spin and the colour of a propagating optical photon. The demonstration of entanglement relies on the use of fast, single-photon detection, which allows us to project the photon into a superposition of red and blue frequency components. Our results extend the previous demonstrations of single-spin/single-photon entanglement in trapped ions(3), neutral atoms(4,5) and nitrogen-vacancy centres(6) to the domain of artificial atoms in semiconductor nanostructures that allow for on-chip integration of electronic and photonic elements(7,8). As a result of its fast optical transitions and favourable selection rules, the scheme we implement could in principle generate nearly deterministic entangled spin-photon pairs at a rate determined ultimately by the high spontaneous emission rate. Our observation constitutes a first step towards implementation of a quantum network with nodes(9) consisting of semiconductor spin quantum bits(10-12).","[Gao, W.

Besides their biological importance, such inherently non-equilibrium processes suggest approaches for developing biomimetic active materials from microscopic components that consume energy to generate continuous motion(2-4). Being actively driven, these materials are not constrained by the laws of equilibrium statistical mechanics and can thus exhibit sought-after properties such as autonomous motility, internally generated flows and self-organized beating(5-7). Here, starting from extensile microtubule bundles, we hierarchically assemble far-from-equilibrium analogues of conventional polymer gels, liquid crystals and emulsions. At high enough concentration, the microtubules form a percolating active network characterized by internally driven chaotic flows, hydrodynamic instabilities, enhanced transport and fluid mixing. When confined to emulsion droplets, three-dimensional networks spontaneously adsorb onto the droplet surfaces to produce highly active two-dimensional nematic liquid crystals whose streaming flows are controlled by internally generated fractures and self-healing, as well as unbinding and annihilation of oppositely charged disclination defects. The resulting active emulsions exhibit unexpected properties, such as autonomous motility, which are not observed in their passive analogues. Taken together, these observations exemplify how assemblages of animate microscopic objects exhibit collective biomimetic properties that are very different from those found in materials assembled from inanimate building blocks, challenging us to develop a theoretical framework that would allow for a systematic engineering of their far-from-equilibrium material properties.","[Sanchez, Tim; Chen, Daniel T.

Previous assessments of historic changes in drought over the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries indicate that this may already be happening globally. In particular, calculations of the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) show a decrease in moisture globally since the 1970s with a commensurate increase in the area in drought that is attributed, in part, to global warming(4,5). The simplicity of the PDSI, which is calculated from a simple water-balance model forced by monthly precipitation and temperature data, makes it an attractive tool in large-scale drought assessments, but may give biased results in the context of climate change(6). Here we show that the previously reported increase in global drought is overestimated because the PDSI uses a simplified model of potential evaporation(7) that responds only to changes in temperature and thus responds incorrectly to global warming in recent decades. More realistic calculations, based on the underlying physical principles(8) that take into account changes in available energy, humidity and wind speed, suggest that there has been little change in drought over the past 60 years.

Observations suggest a slowdown of the zonal atmospheric overturning circulation above the tropical Pacific Ocean (the Walker circulation) over the twentieth century(1,5). Although this change has been attributed to a muted hydrological cycle forced by global warming(5,6), the effect of SST warming patterns has not been explored and quantified(1,7,8). Here we perform experiments using an atmospheric model, and find that SST warming patterns are the main cause of the weakened Walker circulation over the past six decades (1950-2009). The SST trend reconstructed from bucket-sampled SST and night-time marine surface air temperature features a reduced zonal gradient in the tropical Indo-Pacific Ocean, a change consistent with subsurface temperature observations(8). Model experiments with this trend pattern robustly simulate the observed changes, including the Walker circulation slowdown and the eastward shift of atmospheric convection from the Indonesian maritime continent to the central tropical Pacific. Our results cannot establish whether the observed changes are due to natural variability or anthropogenic global warming, but they do show that the observed slowdown in the Walker circulation is presumably driven by oceanic rather than atmospheric processes.","[Tokinaga, Hiroki; Xie, Shang-Ping] Univ Hawaii Manoa, SOEST, Dept Meteorol, Int Pacific Res Ctr, 1680 EW Rd, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Xie, Shang-Ping] Ocean Univ China, Phys Oceanog Lab, Qingdao 266003, Peoples R China; [Deser, Clara] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Okumura, Yuko M.] Univ Texas Austin, Inst Geophys, Austin, TX 78758 USA","Tokinaga, H (reprint author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, SOEST, Dept Meteorol, Int Pacific Res Ctr, 1680 EW Rd, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",tokinaga@hawaii.edu; xie@hawaii.edu,"Tokinaga, Hiroki/K-6813-2012; Kosaka, Yu/C-2792-2009; Xie, Shang-Ping/C-1254-2009; Okumura, Yuko/A-9742-2012","Tokinaga, Hiroki/0000-0002-2734-1820; Xie, Shang-Ping/0000-0002-3676-1325; ",JAMSTEC; National Basic Research Program of China [2012CB955600]; NASA; NSF; NOAA,"We thank A.

Molecular time trees have advanced our understanding of the tempo and mode of diversification(5-7) and have identified remarkable adaptive radiations across the tree of life(8-10). However, incomplete joint phylogenetic and geographic sampling has limited broad-scale inference. Thus, the relative prevalence of rapid radiations and the importance of their geographic settings in shaping global biodiversity patterns remain unclear. Here we present, analyse and map the first complete dated phylogeny of all 9,993 extant species of birds, a widely studied group showing many unique adaptations. We find that birds have undergone a strong increase in diversification rate from about 50 million years ago to the near present. This acceleration is due to a number of significant rate increases, both within songbirds and within other young and mostly temperate radiations including the waterfowl, gulls and woodpeckers. Importantly, species characterized with very high past diversification rates are interspersed throughout the avian tree and across geographic space. Geographically, the major differences in diversification rates are hemispheric rather than latitudinal, with bird assemblages in Asia, North America and southern South America containing a disproportionate number of species from recent rapid radiations. The contribution of rapidly radiating lineages to both temporal diversification dynamics and spatial distributions of species diversity illustrates the benefits of an inclusive geographical and taxonomical perspective. Overall, whereas constituent clades may exhibit slowdowns(10,11), the adaptive zone into which modern birds have diversified since the Cretaceous may still offer opportunities for diversification.","[Jetz, W.] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Thomas, G.

Genetically, this phenotype is frequently the product of inactivating polymorphisms in the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene. MC1R encodes a cyclic AMP-stimulating G-protein-coupled receptor that controls pigment production. Minimal receptor activity, as in red hair/fair skin polymorphisms, produces the red/yellow pheomelanin pigment, whereas increasing MC1R activity stimulates the production of black/brown eumelanin(2). Pheomelanin has weak shielding capacity against ultraviolet radiation relative to eumelanin, and has been shown to amplify ultraviolet-A-induced reactive oxygen species(3-5). Several observations, however, complicate the assumption that melanoma risk is completely ultraviolet-radiation-dependent. For example, unlike non-melanoma skin cancers, melanoma is not restricted to sun-exposed skin and ultraviolet radiation signature mutations are infrequently oncogenic drivers(6). Although linkage of melanoma risk to ultraviolet radiation exposure is beyond doubt, ultraviolet-radiation-independent events are likely to have a significant role(1,7). Here we introduce a conditional, melanocyte-targeted allele of the most common melanoma oncoprotein, BRAF(V600E), into mice carrying an inactivating mutation in the Mc1r gene (these mice have a phenotype analogous to red hair/fair skin humans). We observed a high incidence of invasive melanomas without providing additional gene aberrations or ultraviolet radiation exposure. To investigate the mechanism of ultraviolet-radiation-independent carcinogenesis, we introduced an albino allele, which ablates all pigment production on the Mc1r(e/e) background. Selective absence of pheomelanin synthesis was protective against melanoma development. In addition, normal Mc1r(e/e) mouse skin was found to have significantly greater oxidative DNA and lipid damage than albino Mc1r(e/e) mouse skin. These data suggest that the pheomelanin pigment pathway produces ultraviolet-radiation-independent carcinogenic contributions to melanomagenesis by a mechanism of oxidative damage. Although protection from ultraviolet radiation remains important, additional strategies may be required for optimal melanoma prevention.","[Mitra, Devarati; Morgan, Ann; Lo, Jennifer; Robinson, Kathleen C.; Devi, Suprabha P.; Fisher, David E.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Cutaneous Biol Res Ctr, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Luo, Xi; Haigis, Kevin M.; Haber, Daniel A.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Canc, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Wang, Jin; Guerrero, Candace R.; Wang, Yinsheng] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Chem, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Hoang, Mai P.; Mihm, Martin C.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Lennerz, Jochen K.] Univ Ulm, Inst Pathol, D-89070 Ulm, Germany; [Wargo, Jennifer A.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Surg, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Vanover, Jillian C.; D'Orazio, John A.] Univ Kentucky, Sch Med, Lucille P Markey Canc Ctr, Lexington, KY 40536 USA; [McMahon, Martin] Univ Calif San Francisco, Helen Diller Family Comprehens Canc Ctr, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Bosenberg, Marcus W.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Dermatol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Fisher, DE (reprint author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Cutaneous Biol Res Ctr, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA.",dfisher3@partners.org,,", /0000-0002-9520-6874","National Institutes of Health [5R01 AR043369-16, R01-CA101864, F30 ES020663-01]; Dr Miriam and Sheldon G.

This generates a vast repertoire of transcripts that includes protein-coding messenger RNAs, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and repetitive sequences, such as SINEs (short interspersed nuclear elements). A large percentage of ncRNAs are nuclear-enriched with unknown function(4). Antisense lncRNAs may form sense-antisense pairs by pairing with a protein-coding gene on the opposite strand to regulate epigenetic silencing, transcription and mRNA stability(5-10). Here we identify a nuclear-enriched lncRNA antisense to mouse ubiquitin carboxyterminal hydrolase L1 (Uchl1), a gene involved in brain function and neurodegenerative diseases(11). Antisense Uchl1 increases UCHL1 protein synthesis at a post-transcriptional level, hereby identifying a new functional class of lncRNAs. Antisense Uchl1 activity depends on the presence of a 59 overlapping sequence and an embedded inverted SINEB2 element. These features are shared by other natural antisense transcripts and can confer regulatory activity to an artificial antisense to green fluorescent protein. Antisense Uchl1 function is under the control of stress signalling pathways, as mTORC1 inhibition by rapamycin causes an increase in UCHL1 protein that is associated to the shuttling of antisense Uchl1 RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Antisense Uchl1 RNA is then required for the association of the overlapping sense protein-coding mRNA to active polysomes for translation. These data reveal another layer of gene expression control at the post-transcriptional level.","[Carrieri, Claudia; Cimatti, Laura; Biagioli, Marta; Zucchelli, Silvia; Fedele, Stefania; Gustincich, Stefano] Int Sch Adv Studies SISSA, Area Neurosci, I-34136 Trieste, Italy; [Biagioli, Marta; Zucchelli, Silvia; Gustincich, Stefano] Giovanni Armenise Harvard Fdn Lab, I-34136 Trieste, Italy; [Beugnet, Anne; Pesce, Elisa; Biffo, Stefano] Ist Sci San Raffaele, DIBIT, Lab Mol Histol & Cell Growth, I-20132 Milan, Italy; [Ferrer, Isidre] Univ Hosp Bellvitge, IDIBELL, Inst Neuropathol, Lhospitalet De Llobregat 08907, Spain; [Collavin, Licio] LNCIB, I-34149 Trieste, Italy; [Collavin, Licio] Univ Trieste, Dept Life Sci DSV, I-34129 Trieste, Italy; [Santoro, Claudio] Univ Piemonte Orientale, Dept Hlth Sci, I-28100 Novara, Italy; [Forrest, Alistair R.

However, efficacious vaccines that rely on T cells for protection have been difficult to develop, as robust systemic memory T-cell responses do not necessarily correlate with host protection(1). In peripheral sites, tissue-resident memory T cells provide superior protection compared to circulating memory T cells(2,3). Here we describe a simple and non-inflammatory vaccine strategy that enables the establishment of a protective memory T-cell pool within peripheral tissue. The female genital tract, which is a portal of entry for sexually transmitted infections, is an immunologically restrictive tissue that prevents entry of activated T cells in the absence of inflammation or infection(4). To overcome this obstacle, we developed a vaccine strategy that we term 'prime and pull' to establish local tissue-resident memory T cells at a site of potential viral exposure. This approach relies on two steps: conventional parenteral vaccination to elicit systemic T-cell responses (prime), followed by recruitment of activated T cells by means of topical chemokine application to the restrictive genital tract (pull), where such T cells establish a long-term niche and mediate protective immunity. In mice, prime and pull protocol reduces the spread of infectious herpes simplex virus 2 into the sensory neurons and prevents development of clinical disease. These results reveal a promising vaccination strategy against herpes simplex virus 2, and potentially against other sexually transmitted infections such as human immunodeficiency virus.","[Shin, Haina; Iwasaki, Akiko] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Immunobiol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Iwasaki, A (reprint author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Immunobiol, 300 Cedar St, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",akiko.iwasaki@yale.edu,,,"NIAID [F32AI091024]; NIH [AI054359, AI062428]","We thank E.

Calmodulin-stimulated calcium pumps, which include the plasma-membrane Ca2+-ATPases (PMCAs), are key regulators of intracellular Ca2+ in eukaryotes(5-8). They contain a unique amino- or carboxy-terminal regulatory domain responsible for autoinhibition, and binding of calcium-loaded calmodulin to this domain releases autoinhibition and activates the pump. However, the structural basis for the activation mechanism is unknown and a key remaining question is how calmodulin-mediated PMCA regulation can cover both basal Ca2+ levels in the nanomolar range as well as micromolar-range Ca2+ transients generated by cell stimulation(7). Here we present an integrated study combining the determination of the high-resolution crystal structure of a PMCA regulatory-domain/calmodulin complex with in vivo characterization and biochemical, biophysical and bioinformatics data that provide mechanistic insights into a two-step PMCA activation mechanism mediated by calcium-loaded calmodulin. The structure shows the entire PMCA regulatory domain and reveals an unexpected 2: 1 stoichiometry with two calcium-loaded calmodulin molecules binding to different sites on a long helix. A multifaceted characterization of the role of both sites leads to a general structural-model for calmodulin-mediated regulation of PMCAs that allows stringent, highly responsive control of intracellular calcium in eukaryotes, making it possible to maintain a stable, basal level at a threshold Ca2+ concentration, where steep activation occurs.","[Tidow, Henning; Poulsen, Lisbeth R.; Knudsen, Michael; Hein, Kim L.; Palmgren, Michael G.; Nissen, Poul] Aarhus Univ, Ctr Membrane Pumps Cells & Dis PUMPKIN, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Tidow, Henning; Hein, Kim L.; Nissen, Poul] Aarhus Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Poulsen, Lisbeth R.; Palmgren, Michael G.] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Plant Biol & Biotechnol, DK-1871 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Andreeva, Antonina] MRC Lab Mol Biol, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England; [Knudsen, Michael] Aarhus Univ, Bioinformat Res Ctr, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Wiuf, Carsten] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Math Sci, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark","Palmgren, MG (reprint author), Aarhus Univ, Ctr Membrane Pumps Cells & Dis PUMPKIN, Gustav Wieds Vej 10C, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",palmgren@life.ku.dk; pn@mb.au.dk,"; Palmgren, Michael/A-9808-2013; Wiuf, Carsten/H-6320-2011; Nissen, Poul/D-5774-2014; Poulsen, Lisbeth/I-1843-2014","Tidow, Henning/0000-0002-4702-9332; Knudsen, Michael/0000-0002-6294-2517; Palmgren, Michael/0000-0002-9982-6114; Wiuf, Carsten/0000-0002-1302-4445; Poulsen, Lisbeth/0000-0002-9133-3358; Nissen, Poul/0000-0003-0948-6628",EMBO Long-Term Fellowship; Marie-Curie Intra-European Fellowship; HFSP Long-Term Fellowship; ERC advanced grant (BIOMEMOS),"We thank members of the Nissen and Palmgren labs for discussions, and P.

For example, endothelial NOS controls blood pressure, blood flow and oxygen delivery through its effect on vascular smooth muscle tone(4), but the regulation of these processes is not adequately explained by simple NO diffusion from endothelium to smooth muscle(3,5). Here we report a new model for the regulation of NO signalling by demonstrating that haemoglobin (Hb) alpha (encoded by the HBA1 and HBA2 genes in humans) is expressed in human and mouse arterial endothelial cells and enriched at the myoendothelial junction, where it regulates the effects of NO on vascular reactivity. Notably, this function is unique to Hb alpha and is abrogated by its genetic depletion. Mechanistically, endothelial Hb alpha haem iron in the Fe3+ state permits NO signalling, and this signalling is shut off when Hb alpha is reduced to the Fe2+ state by endothelial cytochrome b5 reductase 3 (CYB5R3, also known as diaphorase 1)(6). Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of CYB5R3 increases NO bioactivity in small arteries. These data reveal a new mechanism by which the regulation of the intracellular Hb alpha oxidation state controls NOS signalling in non-erythroid cells. This model may be relevant to haem-containing globins in a broad range of NOS-containing somatic cells(7-13).","[Straub, Adam C.; Lohman, Alexander W.; Billaud, Marie; Johnstone, Scott R.; Lee, Monica Y.; Bortz, Pamela Schoppee; Best, Angela K.; Isakson, Brant E.] Univ Virginia, Robert M Berne Cardiovasc Res Ctr, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Lohman, Alexander W.; Billaud, Marie; Isakson, Brant E.] Univ Virginia, Dept Mol Physiol & Biol Phys, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Dwyer, Scott T.; Gaston, Benjamin] Univ Virginia, Dept Pediat, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Columbus, Linda] Univ Virginia, Dept Chem, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA","Isakson, BE (reprint author), Univ Virginia, Robert M Berne Cardiovasc Res Ctr, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA.",brant@virginia.edu,"johnstone, scott/E-5032-2013; Columbus, Linda/F-5877-2010; Billaud, Marie/N-7609-2017","johnstone, scott/0000-0003-1920-5033; Columbus, Linda/0000-0002-2574-0561; Billaud, Marie/0000-0002-7591-0362","American Heart Association; National Institutes of Health [HL088554, HL107963, HL059337, HL101871, HL112904, HL007284]","We thank the Advanced Microscopy and Histology core at the University of Virginia and the Yale Proteomic Facility.

The yeast NDH-2 (Ndi1) oxidizes NADH on the matrix side and reduces ubiquinone to maintain mitochondrial NADH/NAD(+) homeostasis. Ndi1 is a potential therapeutic agent for human diseases caused by complex I defects(2-9), particularly Parkinson's disease, because its expression restores the mitochondrial activity in animals with complex I deficiency. NDH-2s in pathogenic microorganisms are viable targets for new antibiotics(10,11). Here we solve the crystal structures of Ndi1 in its substrate-free, NADH-, ubiquinone-and NADH-ubiquinone-bound states, to help understand the catalytic mechanism of NDH-2s. We find that Ndi1 homodimerization through its carboxy-terminal domain is critical for its catalytic activity and membrane targeting. The structures reveal two ubiquinone-binding sites (UQ(I) and UQ(II)) in Ndi1. NADH and UQ(I) can bind to Ndi1 simultaneously to form a substrate-protein complex. We propose that UQ(I) interacts with FAD to act as an intermediate for electron transfer, and that NADH transfers electrons through this FAD-UQ(I) complex to UQ(II). Together our data reveal the regulatory and catalytic mechanisms of Ndi1 and may facilitate the development or targeting of NDH-2s for potential therapeutic applications.","[Feng, Yue; Li, Wenfei; Li, Jian; Wang, Jiawei; Ge, Jingpeng; Xu, Duo; Wu, Jia-Wei; Zhou, Bing; Yang, Maojun] Tsinghua Univ, State Key Lab Biomembrane & Membrane Biotechnol, Tsinghua Peking Ctr Life Sci, Sch Life Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yanjing; Zeng, Qingyin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Systemat & Evolutionary Bot, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Wu, Kaiqi; Tian, Changlin] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Life Sci, Hefei Natl Lab Phys Sci Microscale, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Tian, Changlin] Chinese Acad Sci, High Magnet Field Lab, Hefei 230031, Anhui, Peoples R China","Yang, MJ (reprint author), Tsinghua Univ, State Key Lab Biomembrane & Membrane Biotechnol, Tsinghua Peking Ctr Life Sci, Sch Life Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",maojunyang@tsinghua.edu.cn,"Tian, Changlin/P-1469-2014","Yang, Maojun/0000-0002-6798-3094","Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2011CB910502, 2011CB910900, 2012CB911101]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31030020, 31170679]; Chinese Key Research Plan-Protein Sciences [2011CB911104]","We would like to thank the staff at beamline BL17U of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility for their assistance with data collection.

However, it is unknown whether subpopulations of VTA dopamine neurons participate in distinct circuits that encode different motivational signatures, and whether inputs to the VTA differentially modulate such circuits. Here we show that, because of differences in synaptic connectivity, activation of inputs to the VTA from the laterodorsal tegmentum and the lateral habenula elicit reward and aversion in mice, respectively. Laterodorsal tegmentum neurons preferentially synapse on dopamine neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens lateral shell, whereas lateral habenula neurons synapse primarily on dopamine neurons projecting to the medial prefrontal cortex as well as on GABAergic (gamma-aminobutyric-acid-containing) neurons in the rostromedial tegmental nucleus.

Understanding how these are encoded in amino-acid sequences is complicated by energetically unfavourable non-ideal features-for example kinked alpha-helices, bulged beta-strands, strained loops and buried polar groups-that arise in proteins from evolutionary selection for biological function or from neutral drift. Here we describe an approach to designing ideal protein structures stabilized by completely consistent local and non-local interactions. The approach is based on a set of rules relating secondary structure patterns to protein tertiary motifs, which make possible the design of funnel-shaped protein folding energy landscapes leading into the target folded state. Guided by these rules, we designed sequences predicted to fold into ideal protein structures consisting of alpha-helices, beta-strands and minimal loops. Designs for five different topologies were found to be monomeric and very stable and to adopt structures in solution nearly identical to the computational models. These results illuminate how the folding funnels of natural proteins arise and provide the foundation for engineering a new generation of functional proteins free from natural evolution.","[Koga, Nobuyasu; Tatsumi-Koga, Rie; Baker, David] Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Koga, Nobuyasu; Tatsumi-Koga, Rie; Baker, David] Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Liu, Gaohua; Xiao, Rong; Acton, Thomas B.; Montelione, Gaetano T.] Rutgers State Univ, Ctr Adv Biotechnol & Med, Dept Mol Biol & Biochem, NE Struct Genom Consortium, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; [Liu, Gaohua; Xiao, Rong; Acton, Thomas B.; Montelione, Gaetano T.] Univ Med & Dent New Jersey, Robert Wood Johnson Med Sch, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA","Baker, D (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",guy@cabm.rutgers.edu; dabaker@u.washington.edu,"Baker, David/K-8941-2012","Baker, David/0000-0001-7896-6217",HHMI; DOE; DARPA; DTRA; National Institutes of General Medical Science Protein Structure Initiative (PSI: Biology) programme [U54 GM094597]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Postdoctoral Fellowships for Research Abroad,"We thank N.

A small subset of these events have luminosities that evolve slowly and result in radiated energies of up to about 10(51) ergs. Therefore, they are probably examples of 'pair-instability' or 'pulsational pair-instability' supernovae with estimated progenitor masses of 100 to 250 times that of the Sun(3-5). These events are exceedingly rare at low redshift, but are expected to be more common at high redshift because the mass distribution of the earliest stars was probably skewed to high values(6,7). Here we report the detection of two superluminous supernovae, at redshifts of 2.05 and 3.90, that have slowly evolving light curves. We estimate the rate of events at redshifts of 2 and 4 to be approximately ten times higher than the rate at low redshift. The extreme luminosities of superluminous supernovae extend the redshift limit for supernova detection using present technology, previously 2.36 (ref. 8), and provide a way of investigating the deaths of the first generation of stars to form after the Big Bang.","[Cooke, Jeff; Ryan-Weber, Emma V.; Diaz, C.

However, present methods are not able to image through opaque layers that scatter all the incident light(4,5). Even a very thin layer of a scattering material can appear opaque and hide any objects behind it(6). Although great progress has been made recently with methods such as ghost imaging(7,8) and wavefront shaping(9-11), present procedures are still invasive because they require either a detector(12) or a nonlinear material(13) to be placed behind the scattering layer. Here we report an optical method that allows non-invasive imaging of a fluorescent object that is completely hidden behind an opaque scattering layer. We illuminate the object with laser light that has passed through the scattering layer. We scan the angle of incidence of the laser beam and detect the total fluorescence of the object from the front. From the detected signal, we obtain the image of the hidden object using an iterative algorithm(14,15). As a proof of concept, we retrieve a detailed image of a fluorescent object, comparable in size (50 micrometres) to a typical human cell, hidden 6 millimetres behind an opaque optical diffuser, and an image of a complex biological sample enclosed between two opaque screens. This approach to non-invasive imaging through strongly scattering media can be generalized to other contrast mechanisms and geometries.","[Bertolotti, Jacopo; van Putten, Elbert G.; Lagendijk, Ad; Vos, Willem L.; Mosk, Allard P.] Univ Twente, MESA Inst Nanotechnol, Complex Photon Syst COPS, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands; [Bertolotti, Jacopo] Univ Florence, Dipartimento Fis, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, Italy; [Blum, Christian] Univ Twente, MESA Inst Nanotechnol, Nanobiophys NBP, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands; [Lagendijk, Ad] FOM Inst Atom & Mol Phys, NL-1098 XG Amsterdam, Netherlands","Bertolotti, J (reprint author), Univ Twente, MESA Inst Nanotechnol, Complex Photon Syst COPS, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.",j.bertolotti@utwente.nl,"Vos, Willem/B-7489-2012; Mosk, Allard/B-2401-2008; Bertolotti, Jacopo/A-4314-2009; Lagendijk, Ad/I-5409-2013","Vos, Willem/0000-0003-3066-859X; Bertolotti, Jacopo/0000-0002-7163-6343; Mosk, Allard/0000-0002-1140-6626",Stichting Technische Wetenschappen; Stichting voor Fundamenteel Onderzoek der Materie; Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (NWO); FIRB-MIUR 'Futuro in Ricerca' [RBFR08UH60]; NWO; European Research Council [279248],"We thank W.

Today there is a resurgence of interest in solventogenic Clostridium species to produce n-butanol and ethanol for use as renewable alternative transportation fuels(1-3). Acetone, a product of acetone-n-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation, harbours a nucleophilic alpha-carbon, which is amenable to C-C bond formation with the electrophilic alcohols produced in ABE fermentation. This functionality can be used to form higher-molecular-mass hydrocarbons similar to those found in current jet and diesel fuels. Here we describe the integration of biological and chemocatalytic routes to convert ABE fermentation products efficiently into ketones by a palladium-catalysed alkylation. Tuning of the reaction conditions permits the production of either petrol or jet and diesel precursors. Glyceryl tributyrate was used for the in situ selective extraction of both acetone and alcohols to enable the simple integration of ABE fermentation and chemical catalysis, while reducing the energy demand of the overall process. This process provides a means to selectively produce petrol, jet and diesel blend stocks from lignocellulosic and cane sugars at yields near their theoretical maxima.","[Anbarasan, Pazhamalai; Sreekumar, Sanil; Gross, Elad; Toste, F.

Records for melt were broken in 2005(4), 2007(5), 2010(6) and 2012(7). Much of the increased surface melt is occurring in the percolation zone, a region of the accumulation area that is perennially covered by snow and firn (partly compacted snow). The fate of melt water in the percolation zone is poorly constrained: some may travel away from its point of origin and eventually influence the ice sheet's flow dynamics and mass balance and the global sea level, whereas some may simply infiltrate into cold snow or firn and refreeze with none of these effects. Here we quantify the existing water storage capacity of the percolation zone of the Greenland ice sheet and show the potential for hundreds of gigatonnes of meltwater storage. We collected in situ observations of firn structure and meltwater retention along a roughly 85-kilometre-long transect of the melting accumulation area. Our data show that repeated infiltration events in which melt water penetrates deeply(more than 10 metres) eventually fill all pore space with water. As future surface melt intensifies under Arctic warming, a fraction of melt water that would otherwise contribute to sea-level rise will fill existing pore space of the percolation zone. We estimate the lower and upper bounds of this storage sink to be 322 +/- 44 gigatonnes and 1,289(-252)(+388) gigatonnes, respectively. Furthermore, we find that decades are required to fill this pore space under a range of plausible future climate conditions. Hence, routing of surface melt water into filling the pore space of the firn column will delay expansion of the area contributing to sea-level rise, although once the pore space is filled it cannot quickly be regenerated.","[Harper, J.; Brown, J.] Univ Montana, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Humphrey, N.] Univ Wyoming, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Pfeffer, W.

These excursions may be linked in an oscillatory, approximately coaxial succession about the centre of the contemporaneous supercontinent(5-7). Within the framework of a standard rotational theory(8,9), in which a delayed viscous adjustment of the rotational bulge acts to stabilize the rotation axis(10), geodynamic models for oscillatory TPW generally appeal to consecutive, opposite loading phases of comparable magnitude(6,11,12). Here we extend a nonlinear rotational stability theory(10) to incorporate the stabilizing effect of TPW-induced elastic stresses in the lithosphere(13,14). We demonstrate that convectively driven inertia perturbations acting on a nearly prolate, non-hydrostatic Earth(6,7) with an effective elastic lithospheric thickness of about 10 kilometres yield oscillatory TPW paths consistent with palaeomagnetic inferences. This estimate of elastic thickness can be reduced, even to zero, if the rotation axis is stabilized by long-term excess ellipticity in the plane of the TPW. We speculate that these sources of stabilization, acting on TPW driven by a time-varying mantle flow field(11,12,15-18), provide a mechanism for linking the distinct, oscillatory TPW events of the past few billion years.","[Creveling, J.

These programs consist of integrated genetic circuits that individually implement operations ranging from digital logic to dynamic circuits(2-6), and they have been used in various cellular engineering applications, including the implementation of process control in metabolic networks and the coordination of spatial differentiation in artificial tissues. A key limitation is that the circuits are based on biochemical interactions occurring in the confined volume of the cell, so the size of programs has been limited to a few circuits(1,7). Here we apply part mining and directed evolution to build a set of transcriptional AND gates in Escherichia coli. Each AND gate integrates two promoter inputs and controls one promoter output. This allows the gates to be layered by having the output promoter of an upstream circuit serve as the input promoter for a downstream circuit. Each gate consists of a transcription factor that requires a second chaperone protein to activate the output promoter. Multiple activator-chaperone pairs are identified from type III secretion pathways in different strains of bacteria. Directed evolution is applied to increase the dynamic range and orthogonality of the circuits. These gates are connected in different permutations to form programs, the largest of which is a 4-input AND gate that consists of 3 circuits that integrate 4 inducible systems, thus requiring 11 regulatory proteins. Measuring the performance of individual gates is sufficient to capture the behaviour of the complete program. Errors in the output due to delays (faults), a common problem for layered circuits, are not observed. This work demonstrates the successful layering of orthogonal logic gates, a design strategy that could enable the construction of large, integrated circuits in single cells.","[Moon, Tae Seok; Lou, Chunbo; Stanton, Brynne C.; Voigt, Christopher A.] MIT, Dept Biol Engn, Synthet Biol Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Tamsir, Alvin] Univ Calif San Francisco, Tetrad Grad Program, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA","Voigt, CA (reprint author), MIT, Dept Biol Engn, Synthet Biol Ctr, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",cavoigt@gmail.com,,,Life Technologies; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Chronicle of Lineage Indicative of Origins (DARPA) [CLIO N66001-12-C-4018]; Office of Naval Research [N00014-10-1-0245]; National Science Foundation (NSF) [CCF-0943385]; National Institutes of Health [AI067699]; NSF Synthetic Biology Engineering Research Center (SynBERC) [SA5284-11210],"C.A.V. is supported by Life Technologies, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Chronicle of Lineage Indicative of Origins (DARPA; CLIO N66001-12-C-4018), the Office of Naval Research (N00014-10-1-0245), the National Science Foundation (NSF; CCF-0943385), the National Institutes of Health (AI067699) and the NSF Synthetic Biology Engineering Research Center (SynBERC; SA5284-11210).

Colorectal cancer often follows a genetic pathway whereby loss of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumour suppressor and activation of beta-catenin are followed by mutations in K-Ras, PIK3CA and TP53, as the tumour emerges and progresses(1,2). Curiously, however, 'inflammatory signature' genes characteristic of colitis-associated cancer are also upregulated in colorectal cancer(3,4). Further, like most solid tumours, colorectal cancer exhibits immune/inflammatory infiltrates(5), referred to as 'tumour-elicited inflammation'(6). Although infiltrating CD4(+) T(H)1 cells and CD8(+) cytotoxic T cells constitute a positive prognostic sign in colorectal cancer(7,8), myeloid cells and T-helper interleukin (IL)-17-producing (T(H)17) cells promote tumorigenesis(5,6), and a 'T(H)17 expression signature' in stage I/II colorectal cancer is associated with a drastic decrease in disease-free survival(9). Despite its pathogenic importance, the mechanisms responsible for the appearance of tumour-elicited inflammation are poorly understood. Many epithelial cancers develop proximally to microbial communities, which are physically separated from immune cells by an epithelial barrier(10). We investigated mechanisms responsible for tumour-elicited inflammation in a mouse model of colorectal tumorigenesis, which, like human colorectal cancer, exhibits upregulation of IL-23 and IL-17. Here we show that IL-23 signalling promotes tumour growth and progression, and development of a tumoural IL-17 response. IL-23 is mainly produced by tumour-associated myeloid cells that are likely to be activated by microbial products, which penetrate the tumours but not adjacent tissue. Both early and late colorectal neoplasms exhibit defective expression of several barrier proteins. We propose that barrier deterioration induced by colorectal-cancer-initiating genetic lesions results in adenoma invasion by microbial products that trigger tumour-elicited inflammation, which in turn drives tumour growth.","[Grivennikov, Sergei I.; Wang, Kepeng; Jauch, Dominik; Taniguchi, Koji; Yu, Guann-Yi; Karin, Michael] Univ Calif San Diego, Lab Gene Regulat & Signal Transduct, Dept Pharmacol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Grivennikov, Sergei I.; Wang, Kepeng; Jauch, Dominik; Taniguchi, Koji; Yu, Guann-Yi; Karin, Michael] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Pathol, Sch Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Wang, Kepeng] Shenzhen PKU HKUST Med Ctr, Biomed Res Inst, Shenzhen, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Mucida, Daniel; Cheroutre, Hilde] La Jolla Inst Allergy & Immunol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Mucida, Daniel] Rockefeller Univ, Lab Mucosal Immunol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Stewart, C.

This association could be explained by the hypothesis that the same factors and pathways important for wound healing also promote tumorigenesis. A sensor of tissue damage should induce these factors to promote tissue repair and regulate their action to prevent development of cancer. Interleukin 22 (IL-22), a cytokine of the IL-10 superfamily, has an important role in colonic epithelial cell repair, and its levels are increased in the blood and intestine of inflammatory bowel disease patients(2,3). This cytokine can be neutralized by the soluble IL-22 receptor, known as the IL-22 binding protein (IL-22BP, also known as IL22RA2); however, the significance of endogenous IL-22BP in vivo and the pathways that regulate this receptor are unknown(4,5). Here we describe that IL-22BP has a crucial role in controlling tumorigenesis and epithelial cell proliferation in the colon. IL-22BP is highly expressed by dendritic cells in the colon in steady-state conditions. Sensing of intestinal tissue damage via the NLRP3 or NLRP6 inflammasomes led to an IL-18-dependent downregulation of IL-22BP, thereby increasing the ratio of IL-22/IL-22BP. IL-22, which is induced during intestinal tissue damage, exerted protective properties during the peak of damage, but promoted tumour development if uncontrolled during the recovery phase. Thus, the IL-22-IL-22BP axis critically regulates intestinal tissue repair and tumorigenesis in the colon.","[Huber, Samuel; Gagliani, Nicola; Zenewicz, Lauren A.; Bosurgi, Lidia; Hu, Bo; O'Connor, William, Jr.; Flavell, Richard A.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Immunobiol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Huber, Samuel; Huber, Francis J.] Univ Klinikum Hamburg Eppendorf, Med Klin 1, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany; [Hedl, Matija; Abraham, Clara] Yale Univ, Sect Digest Dis, Dept Internal Med, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Zhang, Wei; Cho, Judy H.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Zhang, Wei; Cho, Judy H.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Sect Digest Dis, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Murphy, Andrew J.; Valenzuela, David M.; Yancopoulos, George D.] Regeneron Pharmaceut Inc, Tarrytown, NY 10591 USA; [Booth, Carmen J.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Sect Comparat Med, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Ouyang, Wenjun] Genentech Inc, Dept Immunol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Flavell, Richard A.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Flavell, RA (reprint author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Immunobiol, 333 Cedar St, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",shuber@uke.de; richard.flavell@yale.edu,,"Murphy, Andrew/0000-0003-4152-4081; Ouyang, Wenjun/0000-0002-1811-5864; Huber, Samuel/0000-0001-9325-8227; Zenewicz, Lauren/0000-0002-8787-5955",Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America; Stiftung experimentelle Biomedizin; Ernst Jung Foundation; EMBO; American Cancer Society; DFG [SFB841];  [R01DK077905];  [DK-P30-34989];  [U19-AI082713],"The authors would like to thank F.

However, specific B-cell subsets can also negatively regulate T-cell immune responses, and have been termed regulatory B cells(2-4). Human and mouse regulatory B cells (B10 cells) with the ability to express the inhibitory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) have been identified(2-5). Although rare, B10 cells are potent negative regulators of antigen-specific inflammation and T-cell-dependent autoimmune diseases in mice(5-7). How B10-cell IL-10 production and regulation of antigen-specific immune responses are controlled in vivo without inducing systemic immunosuppression is unknown. Using a mouse model for multiple sclerosis, here we show that B10-cell maturation into functional IL-10-secreting effector cells that inhibit in vivo autoimmune disease requires IL-21 and CD40-dependent cognate interactions with T cells. Moreover, the ex vivo provision of CD40 and IL-21 receptor signals can drive B10-cell development and expansion by four-million-fold, and generate B10 effector cells producing IL-10 that markedly inhibit disease symptoms when transferred into mice with established autoimmune disease. The ex vivo expansion and reinfusion of autologous B10 cells may provide a novel and effective in vivo treatment for severe autoimmune diseases that are resistant to current therapies.","[Yoshizaki, Ayumi; Miyagaki, Tomomitsu; DiLillo, David J.; Matsushita, Takashi; Horikawa, Mayuka; Kountikov, Evgueni I.; Poe, Jonathan C.; Tedder, Thomas F.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Immunol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Spolski, Rosanne; Leonard, Warren J.] NHLBI, Lab Mol Immunol, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Tedder, TF (reprint author), Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Immunol, Durham, NC 27710 USA.",thomas.tedder@duke.edu,"Matsushita, Takashi /C-4750-2015","Matsushita, Takashi /0000-0002-1617-086X","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [AI56363, AI057157]; Lymphoma Research Foundation; Division of Intramural Research, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NIH","We thank D.

However, the signalling pathways that control mitochondrial Ca2+ entry through the inner membrane mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU)(3-5) are not known. The multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is activated in ischaemia reperfusion, myocardial infarction and neurohumoral injury, common causes of myocardial death and heart failure; these findings suggest that CaMKII could couple disease stress to mitochondrial injury. Here we show that CaMKII promotes mPTP opening and myocardial death by increasing MCU current (I-MCU). Mitochondrial-targeted CaMKII inhibitory protein or cyclosporin A, an mPTP antagonist with clinical efficacy in ischaemia reperfusion injury(6), equivalently prevent mPTP opening, Delta Psi m deterioration and diminish mitochondrial disruption and programmed cell death in response to ischaemia reperfusion injury. Mice with myocardial and mitochondrial-targeted CaMKII inhibition have reduced I-MCU and are resistant to ischaemia reperfusion injury, myocardial infarction and neurohumoral injury, suggesting that pathological actions of CaMKII are substantially mediated by increasing I-MCU. Our findings identify CaMKII activity as a central mechanism for mitochondrial Ca2+ entry in myocardial cell death, and indicate that mitochondrial-targeted CaMKII inhibition could prevent or reduce myocardial death and heart failure in response to common experimental forms of pathophysiological stress.","[Joiner, Mei-ling A.; Koval, Olha M.; Li, Jingdong; He, B.

COLI; FILAMENTS; EXCHANGE; MECHANISM; DYNAMICS; KINETICS,"Escherichia coli RecA is the defining member of a ubiquitous class of DNA strand-exchange proteins that are essential for homologous recombination, a pathway that maintains genomic integrity by repairing broken DNA(1). To function, filaments of RecA must nucleate and grow on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) in direct competition with ssDNA-binding protein (SSB), which rapidly binds and continuously sequesters ssDNA, kinetically blocking RecA assembly(2,3). This dynamic self-assembly on a DNA lattice, in competition with another protein, is unique for the RecA family compared to other filament-forming proteins such as actin and tubulin. The complexity of this process has hindered our understanding of RecA filament assembly because ensemble measurements cannot reliably distinguish between the nucleation and growth phases, despite extensive and diverse attempts(2-5). Previous single-molecule assays have measured the nucleation and growth of RecA-and its eukaryotic homologue RAD51-on naked double-stranded DNA and ssDNA(6-12); however, the template for RecA self-assembly in vivo is SSB-coated ssDNA(3). Using single-molecule microscopy, here we directly visualize RecA filament assembly on single molecules of SSB-coated ssDNA, simultaneously measuring nucleation and growth. We establish that a dimer of RecA is required for nucleation, followed by growth of the filament through monomer addition, consistent with the finding that nucleation, but not growth, is modulated by nucleotide and magnesium ion cofactors. Filament growth is bidirectional, albeit faster in the 5'-> 3' direction. Both nucleation and growth are repressed at physiological conditions, highlighting the essential role of recombination mediators in potentiating assembly in vivo. We define a two-step kinetic mechanism in which RecA nucleates on transiently exposed ssDNA during SSB sliding and/or partial dissociation (DNA unwrapping) and then the RecA filament grows. We further demonstrate that the recombination mediator protein pair, RecOR (RecO and RecR), accelerates both RecA nucleation and filament growth, and that the introduction of RecF further stimulates RecA nucleation.","[Bell, Jason C.; Plank, Jody L.; Dombrowski, Christopher C.; Kowalczykowski, Stephen C.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Microbiol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Bell, Jason C.; Plank, Jody L.; Dombrowski, Christopher C.; Kowalczykowski, Stephen C.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Bell, Jason C.; Kowalczykowski, Stephen C.] Univ Calif Davis, Biochem & Mol Biol Grad Grp, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Kowalczykowski, SC (reprint author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Microbiol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",sckowalczykowski@ucdavis.edu,,"Bell, Jason/0000-0001-5480-7975; Plank, Jody/0000-0002-8025-7935","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [T32 GM007377, CA10052159, CA136103, GM62653, GM64745]",We are grateful to members of the laboratory for their comments on this work.

Primary piRNAs come from discrete genomic loci, termed piRNA clusters, and seem to be derived from long, single-stranded precursors(2). The biogenesis of primary piRNAs involves at least two nucleolytic steps. An unknown enzyme cleaves piRNA cluster transcripts to generate monophosphorylated piRNA 5' ends. piRNA 3' ends are probably formed by exonucleolytic trimming, after a piRNA precursor is loaded into its PIWI partner(1,3). Secondary piRNAs arise during the adaptive 'ping-pong' cycle, with their 5' termini being formed by the activity of PIWIs themselves(2,4). A number of proteins have been implicated genetically in primary piRNA biogenesis. One of these, Drosophila melanogaster Zucchini, is a member of the phospholipase-D family of phosphodiesterases, which includes both phospholipases and nucleases(5-7). Here we produced a dimeric, soluble fragment of the mouse Zucchini homologue (mZuc; also known as PLD6) and show that it possesses single-strand-specific nuclease activity. A crystal structure of mZuc at 1.75 angstrom resolution indicates greater architectural similarity to phospholipase-D family nucleases than to phospholipases. Together, our data suggest that the Zucchini proteins act in primary piRNA biogenesis as nucleases, perhaps generating the 5' ends of primary piRNAs.","[Ipsaro, Jonathan J.; Haase, Astrid D.; Knott, Simon R.; Joshua-Tor, Leemor; Hannon, Gregory J.] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; [Ipsaro, Jonathan J.; Joshua-Tor, Leemor] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, WM Keck Struct Biol Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA","Hannon, GJ (reprint author), Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA.",leemor@cshl.edu; hannon@cshl.edu,,"Joshua-Tor, Leemor/0000-0001-8185-8049; Ipsaro, Jonathan/0000-0002-2743-3776","National Cancer Institute Cancer Center Support Grant [CA045508]; Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences; Harvey L.

Primary piRNAs are processed from long non-coding RNA precursors transcribed from piRNA clusters in the genome through the primary processing pathway(5,8-10). Although the existence of a ribonuclease participating in this pathway has been predicted, its molecular identity remained unknown. Here we show that Zucchini (Zuc), a mitochondrial phospholipase D (PLD) superfamily member(11), is an endoribonuclease essential for primary piRNA biogenesis. We solved the crystal structure of Drosophila melanogaster Zuc (DmZuc) at 1.75 angstrom resolution. The structure revealed that DmZuc has a positively charged, narrow catalytic groove at the dimer interface, which could accommodate a single-stranded, but not a double-stranded, RNA. DmZuc and the mouse homologue MmZuc (also known as Pld6 and MitoPLD)(12-14) showed endoribonuclease activity for single-stranded RNAs in vitro. The RNA cleavage products bear a 5'-monophosphate group, a hallmark of mature piRNAs. Mutational analyses revealed that the conserved active-site residues of DmZuc are critical for the ribonuclease activity in vitro, and for piRNA maturation and transposon silencing in vivo. We propose a model for piRNA biogenesis in animal germ lines, in which the Zuc endoribonuclease has a key role in primary piRNA maturation.","[Nishimasu, Hiroshi; Ishizu, Hirotsugu; Fukuhara, Satoshi; Bonnefond, Luc; Matsumoto, Naoki; Nishizawa, Tomohiro; Ishitani, Ryuichiro; Siomi, Mikiko C.; Nureki, Osamu] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biophys & Biochem, Tokyo 1130032, Japan; [Ishizu, Hirotsugu; Saito, Kuniaki; Kamatani, Miharu K.; Siomi, Haruhiko; Siomi, Mikiko C.] Keio Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol Biol, Tokyo 1608582, Japan; [Nakanaga, Keita; Aoki, Junken] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Sendai, Miyagi 9808578, Japan; [Siomi, Mikiko C.; Nureki, Osamu] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy JST, Core Res Evolut Sci & Technol CREST, Saitama 3320012, Japan","Nureki, O (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biophys & Biochem, Tokyo 1130032, Japan.",siomim@biochem.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp; nureki@biochem.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Saito, Kuniaki/A-6967-2015; Siomi, Haruhiko/A-7020-2015; Bonnefond, Luc/P-3926-2016","Saito, Kuniaki/0000-0001-8233-9283; Siomi, Haruhiko/0000-0001-8690-3822; Bonnefond, Luc/0000-0002-1164-742X; Aoki, Junken/0000-0001-9435-1896","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS); Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST) program 'The Creation of Basic Medical Technologies to Clarify and Control the Mechanisms Underlying Chronic Inflammation' of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan","We thank A.

As a result, complex or low-coordination structures, common in atomic and molecular systems, are rare in the colloidal domain. Here we demonstrate a general method for creating the colloidal analogues of atoms with valence: colloidal particles with chemically distinct surface patches that imitate hybridized atomic orbitals, including sp, sp(2), sp(3), sp(3)d, sp(3)d(2) and sp(3)d(3). Functionalized with DNA with single-stranded sticky ends, patches on different particles can form highly directional bonds through programmable, specific and reversible DNA hybridization. These features allow the particles to self-assemble into 'colloidal molecules' with triangular, tetrahedral and other bonding symmetries, and should also give access to a rich variety of new microstructured colloidal materials.","[Feng, Lang; Hollingsworth, Andrew D.; Pine, David J.] NYU, Ctr Soft Matter Res, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Feng, Lang; Hollingsworth, Andrew D.; Pine, David J.] NYU, Dept Phys, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Wang, Yufeng; Wang, Yu; Weck, Marcus] NYU, Inst Mol Design, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Wang, Yufeng; Wang, Yu; Weck, Marcus] NYU, Dept Chem, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Breed, Dana R.] Dow Chem Co USA, Freeport, TX 77541 USA; [Manoharan, Vinothan N.] Harvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Manoharan, Vinothan N.] Harvard Univ, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Pine, DJ (reprint author), NYU, Ctr Soft Matter Res, New York, NY 10003 USA.",marcus.weck@nyu.edu; pine@nyu.edu,"Manoharan, Vinothan/C-1292-2008; Feng, Lang/P-7891-2014; Wang, Yu/E-7358-2015; Pine, David/B-7740-2016","Manoharan, Vinothan/0000-0003-0370-6095; Wang, Yu/0000-0003-1286-2401; Pine, David/0000-0002-3304-6684; Weck, Marcus/0000-0002-6486-4268",MRSEC Program of the National Science Foundation [DMR-0820341]; National Science Foundation [ChE-0911460]; MRI programme of the National Science Foundation [DMR-0923251],"We thank M.

Here we describe the genomes of 1,092 individuals from 14 populations, constructed using a combination of low-coverage whole-genome and exome sequencing. By developing methods to integrate information across several algorithms and diverse data sources, we provide a validated haplotype map of 38 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, 1.4 million short insertions and deletions, and more than 14,000 larger deletions. We show that individuals from different populations carry different profiles of rare and common variants, and that low-frequency variants show substantial geographic differentiation, which is further increased by the action of purifying selection. We show that evolutionary conservation and coding consequence are key determinants of the strength of purifying selection, that rare-variant load varies substantially across biological pathways, and that each individual contains hundreds of rare non-coding variants at conserved sites, such as motif-disrupting changes in transcription-factor-binding sites. This resource, which captures up to 98% of accessible single nucleotide polymorphisms at a frequency of 1% in related populations, enables analysis of common and low-frequency variants in individuals from diverse, including admixed, populations.","[Donnelly, Peter; McVean, Gil A.; Lunter, Gerton; Marchini, Jonathan L.; Myers, Simon; Gupta-Hinch, Anjali; Iqbal, Zamin; Mathieson, Iain; Rimmer, Andy; Xifara, Dionysia K.; Kerasidou, Angeliki] Univ Oxford, Wellcome Trust Ctr Human Genet, Oxford OX3 7BN, England; [Donnelly, Peter; Marchini, Jonathan L.; Myers, Simon; Churchhouse, Claire; Delaneau, Olivier; Xifara, Dionysia K.; Garrison, Erik P.] Univ Oxford, Dept Stat, Oxford OX1 3TG, England; [Altshuler, David M.; Gabriel, Stacey B.; Gupta, Namrata; Daly, Mark J.; DePristo, Mark A.; Banks, Eric; Bhatia, Gaurav; Carneiro, Mauricio O.; del Angel, Guillermo; Genovese, Giulio; Handsaker, Robert E.; Hartl, Chris; McCarroll, Steven A.; Nemesh, James C.; Poplin, Ryan E.; Schaffner, Stephen F.; Shakir, Khalid; Sabeti, Pardis C.; Grossman, Sharon R.; Tabrizi, Shervin; Tariyal, Ridhi; Li, Heng] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Human Genet Res, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Reich, David] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Durbin, Richard M.; Hurles, Matthew E.; Balasubramaniam, Senduran; Burton, John; Danecek, Petr; Keane, Thomas M.; Kolb-Kokocinski, Anja; McCarthy, Shane; Stalker, James; Quail, Michael; Tyler-Smith, Chris; Ayub, Qasim; Chen, Yuan; Coffey, Alison J.; Colonna, Vincenza; Huang, Ni; Jostins, Luke; Scally, Aylwyn; Walter, Klaudia; Xue, Yali; Zhang, Yujun; Ben Blackburne; Lindsay, Sarah J.; Ning, Zemin; Frankish, Adam; Harrow, Jennifer] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Cambridge CB10 1SA, England; [Abecasis, Goncalo R.; Kang, Hyun Min; Anderson, Paul; Blackwell, Tom; Busonero, Fabio; Fuchsberger, Christian; Jun, Goo; Maschio, Andrea; Porcu, Eleonora; Sidore, Carlo; Tan, Adrian; Trost, Mary Kate] Univ Michigan, Ctr Stat Genet, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Bentley, David R.; Grocock, Russell; Humphray, Sean; James, Terena; Kingsbury, Zoya; Bauer, Markus; Cheetham, R.

So far, research on thyroid morphogenesis has been missing an efficient stem-cell model system that allows for the in vitro recapitulation of the molecular and morphogenic events regulating thyroid follicular-cell differentiation and subsequent assembly into functional thyroid follicles. Here we report that a transient overexpression of the transcription factors NKX2-1 and PAX8 is sufficient to direct mouse embryonic stem-cell differentiation into thyroid follicular cells that organize into three-dimensional follicular structures when treated with thyrotropin. These in vitro-derived follicles showed appreciable iodide organification activity. Importantly, when grafted in vivo into athyroid mice, these follicles rescued thyroid hormone plasma levels and promoted subsequent symptomatic recovery. Thus, mouse embryonic stem cells can be induced to differentiate into thyroid follicular cells in vitro and generate functional thyroid tissue.","[Antonica, Francesco; Kasprzyk, Dominika Figini; Opitz, Robert; Costagliola, Sabine] Univ Libre Brussels, Inst Interdisciplinary Res Mol Human Biol IRIBHM, B-1070 Brussels, Belgium; [Iacovino, Michelina; Kyba, Michael] Univ Minnesota, Lillehei Heart Inst, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Iacovino, Michelina; Kyba, Michael] Univ Minnesota, Dept Pediat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Liao, Xiao-Hui; Dumitrescu, Alexandra Mihaela; Refetoff, Samuel] Univ Chicago, Dept Med, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Refetoff, Samuel] Univ Chicago, Dept Pediat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Refetoff, Samuel] Univ Chicago, Dept Genet, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Peremans, Kathelijne] Univ Ghent, Fac Vet Med, Dept Vet Med Imaging & Small Anim Orthopaed, B-9820 Merelbeke, Belgium; [Manto, Mario] Univ Libre Brussels, FNRS, ERASME, B-1070 Brussels, Belgium","Costagliola, S (reprint author), Univ Libre Brussels, Inst Interdisciplinary Res Mol Human Biol IRIBHM, 808 Route Lennik, B-1070 Brussels, Belgium.",scostag@ulb.ac.be,"costagliola, sabine/D-4864-2012","Kyba, Michael/0000-0002-5579-7534","National Institutes of Health [DK15070, DK91016]; Belgian Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique Medicale [FRSM[2]3_4_557_08, [3]3_4598_12]; Action de Recherche Concertee de la Communaute Francaise de Belgique (ARC) [AUWB-08/13-ULB10]; Fonds d'Encouragement a la Recherche; Belgian National Fund for Scientific Research (FNRS)","We thank G.

In an RNA world, single self-replicating RNAs would have faced the extreme challenge of possessing a mutation rate low enough both to sustain their own information and to compete successfully against molecular parasites with limited evolvability. Thus theoretical analyses suggest that networks of interacting molecules were more likely to develop and sustain life-like behaviour. Here we show that mixtures of RNA fragments that self-assemble into self-replicating ribozymes spontaneously form cooperative catalytic cycles and networks. We find that a specific three-membered network has highly cooperative growth dynamics. When such cooperative networks are competed directly against selfish autocatalytic cycles, the former grow faster, indicating an intrinsic ability of RNA populations to evolve greater complexity through cooperation. We can observe the evolvability of networks through in vitro selection. Our experiments highlight the advantages of cooperative behaviour even at the molecular stages of nascent life.","[Vaidya, Nilesh; Lehman, Niles] Portland State Univ, Dept Chem, Portland, OR 97207 USA; [Manapat, Michael L.] Harvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Manapat, Michael L.] Harvard Univ, Program Evolutionary Dynam, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Chen, Irene A.; Xulvi-Brunet, Ramon] Harvard Univ, FAS Ctr Syst Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Hayden, Eric J.] Stanford Univ, Dept Bioengn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Lehman, N (reprint author), Portland State Univ, Dept Chem, POB 751, Portland, OR 97207 USA.",niles@pdx.edu,,,NASA [NNX10AR15G]; Center for Life in Extreme Environments at Portland State University; Human Frontier Science Program Organization,"We would like to thank A.

Processes active in the space environment produce 'space weathering' products that substantially weaken or mask such diagnostic absorption on airless bodies observed elsewhere(4,5), and it has long been a mystery why Vesta's absorption bands are so strong. Analyses of soil samples from both the Moon(6) and the asteroid Itokawa(7) determined that nanophase metallic particles (commonly nanophase iron) accumulate on the rims of regolith grains with time, accounting for an observed optical degradation. These nanophase particles, believed to be related to solar wind and micrometeoroid bombardment processes, leave unique spectroscopic signatures that can be measured remotely(8-10) but require sufficient spatial resolution to discern the geologic context and history of the surface, which has not been achieved for Vesta until now. Here we report that Vesta shows its own form of space weathering, which is quite different from that of other airless bodies visited. No evidence is detected on Vesta for accumulation of lunar-like nanophase iron on regolith particles, even though distinct material exposed at several fresh craters becomes gradually masked and fades into the background as the craters age. Instead, spectroscopic data reveal that on Vesta a locally homogenized upper regolith is generated with time through small-scale mixing of diverse surface components.","[Pieters, C.

The range of albedos is among the largest observed on Solar System rocky bodies. These dark materials, often associated with craters, appear in ejecta and crater walls, and their pyroxene absorption strengths are correlated with material brightness. It was tentatively suggested that the dark material on Vesta could be either exogenic, from carbon-rich, low-velocity impactors, or endogenic, from freshly exposed mafic material or impact melt, created or exposed by impacts. Here we report Vesta spectra and images and use them to derive and interpret the properties of the 'pure' dark and bright materials. We argue that the dark material is mainly from infall of hydrated carbonaceous material (like that found in a major class of meteorites and some comet surfaces(3-5)), whereas the bright material is the uncontaminated indigenous Vesta basaltic soil. Dark material from low-albedo impactors is diffused over time through the Vestan regolith by impact mixing, creating broader, diffuse darker regions and finally Vesta's background surface material. This is consistent with howardite-eucrite-diogenite meteorites coming from Vesta.","[McCord, T.

So far, experiments have achieved a high degree of control over short-range interactions, but the realization of long-range interactions has become a central focus of research because it would open up a new realm of many-body physics. Rydberg atoms are highly suited to this goal because the van der Waals forces between them are many orders of magnitude larger than those between ground-state atoms(1). Consequently, mere laser excitation of ultracold gases can cause strongly correlated many-body states to emerge directly when atoms are transferred to Rydberg states. A key example is a quantum crystal composed of coherent superpositions of different, spatially ordered configurations of collective excitations(2-5). Here we use high-resolution, in situ Rydberg atom imaging to measure directly strong correlations in a laser-excited, two-dimensional atomic Mott insulator(6). The observations reveal the emergence of spatially ordered excitation patterns with random orientation, but well-defined geometry, in the high-density components of the prepared many-body state. Together with a time-resolved analysis, this supports the description of the system in terms of a correlated quantum state of collective excitations delocalized throughout the gas. Our experiment demonstrates the potential of Rydberg gases to realize exotic phases of matter, thereby laying the basis for quantum simulations of quantum magnets with long-range interactions.","[Schauss, Peter; Cheneau, Marc; Endres, Manuel; Fukuhara, Takeshi; Hild, Sebastian; Omran, Ahmed; Gross, Christian; Kuhr, Stefan; Bloch, Immanuel] Max Planck Inst Quantum Opt, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Pohl, Thomas] Max Planck Inst Phys Komplexer Syst, D-01187 Dresden, Germany; [Kuhr, Stefan] Univ Strathclyde, Dept Phys, SUPA, Glasgow G4 0NG, Lanark, Scotland; [Bloch, Immanuel] Univ Munich, Fak Phys, D-80799 Munich, Germany","Schauss, P (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Quantum Opt, D-85748 Garching, Germany.",peter.schauss@mpq.mpg.de,"Cheneau, Marc/O-9312-2014; Gross, Christian/P-5475-2014; Pohl, Thomas/B-5133-2013; Bloch, Immanuel/G-3174-2010; Kuhr, Stefan/F-7296-2011; Fukuhara, Takeshi/A-6254-2014","Cheneau, Marc/0000-0001-7261-566X; Gross, Christian/0000-0003-2292-5234; Bloch, Immanuel/0000-0002-0679-4759; Schauss, Peter/0000-0002-8505-5195; Fukuhara, Takeshi/0000-0002-6702-9882",MPG; DFG; EU; JSPS,"We thank R.

However, identifying climatic influences on basin stratigraphy is complicated by nonlinearities, feedback loops, lag times, buffering and convergence among processes within the sediment routeing system(3,4). The Palaeocene/Eocene thermal maximum (PETM) arguably represents the most abrupt and dramatic instance of global warming in the Cenozoic era and has been proposed to be a geologic analogue for anthropogenic climate change(5). Here we evaluate the fluvial response in western Colorado to the PETM. Concomitant with the carbon isotope excursion marking the PETM we document a basin-wide shift to thick, multistoried, sheets of sandstone characterized by variable channel dimensions, dominance of upper flow regime sedimentary structures, and prevalent crevasse splay deposits. This progradation of coarse-grained lithofacies matches model predictions for rapid increases in sediment flux and discharge(1,3), instigated by regional vegetation overturn(5,6) and enhanced monsoon precipitation(7,8). Yet the change in fluvial deposition persisted long after the approximately 200,000-year-long PETM9 with its increased carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere, emphasizing the strong role the protracted transmission of catchment responses to distant depositional systems has in constructing large-scale basin stratigraphy. Our results, combined with evidence for increased dissolved loads(10) and terrestrial clay export(5,11,12) to world oceans, indicate that the transient hyper-greenhouse climate of the PETM may represent a major geomorphic 'system-clearing event'(13), involving a global mobilization of dissolved and solid sediment loads on Earth's surface.","[Foreman, Brady Z.; Heller, Paul L.; Clementz, Mark T.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Geol & Geophys, Laramie, WY 82071 USA","Foreman, BZ (reprint author), Univ Wyoming, Dept Geol & Geophys, 1000 E Univ Ave, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",bforema1@uwyo.edu,,,International Association of Sedimentologists; Tobacco Root Geological Society; Colorado Scientific Society; Chevron Energy Technology Company; NSF Graduate Research Fellowship; Wyoming NASA Space Grant Consortium Fellowship,"We thank personnel at the University of Arizona LaserChron Facility and University of Wyoming Stable Isotope Facility for assistance in analysing detrital zircon and carbon isotope samples.

Nd-142 excesses measured in 3.7-billion-year (Gyr)-old rocks from Isua(1,2) (southwest Greenland) relative to modern terrestrial samples imply their derivation from a depleted mantle formed in the Hadean eon (about 4,570-4,000 Gyr ago). As dictated by mass balance, the differentiation event responsible for the formation of the Isua early-depleted reservoir must also have formed a complementary enriched component. However, considerable efforts to find early-enriched mantle components in Isua have so far been unsuccessful(3-7). Here we show that the signature of the Hadean enriched reservoir, complementary to the depleted reservoir in Isua, is recorded in 3.4-Gyr-old mafic dykes intruding into the Early Archaean rocks. Five out of seven dykes carry Nd-142 deficits compared to the terrestrial Nd standard, with three samples yielding resolvable deficits down to -10.6 parts per million. The enriched component that we report here could have been a mantle reservoir that differentiated owing to the crystallization of a magma ocean, or could represent a mafic proto-crust that separated from the mantle more than 4.47 Gyr ago. Our results testify to the existence of an enriched component in the Hadean, and may suggest that the southwest Greenland mantle preserved early-formed heterogeneities until at least 3.4 Gyr ago.","[Rizo, Hanika; Boyet, Maud; O'Neil, Jonathan; Paquette, Jean-Louis] Univ Clermont Ferrand, Clermont Univ, Lab Magmas & Volcans, CNRS,UMR 6524,IRDR 163, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Blichert-Toft, Janne] Ecole Normale Super Lyon, Lab Geol Lyon, F-69007 Lyon, France; [Blichert-Toft, Janne] Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, UMR 5276, F-69007 Lyon, France; [Rosing, Minik T.] Nat Hist Museum Denmark, DK-1350 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Rosing, Minik T.] Univ Copenhagen, Nord Ctr Earth Evolut, DK-1350 Copenhagen, Denmark","Rizo, H (reprint author), Univ Clermont Ferrand, Clermont Univ, Lab Magmas & Volcans, CNRS,UMR 6524,IRDR 163, BP 10448, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France.",h.rizo@opgc.univ-bpclermont.fr,"Blichert-Toft, Janne/C-8280-2012; Rosing, Minik/A-9977-2013","Blichert-Toft, Janne/0000-0002-4932-4079; Rosing, Minik/0000-0001-7559-661X",European Research Council under the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme; French Programme National de Planetologie of the Institut National des Sciences de l'Univers and Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales; French Agence Nationale de la Recherche; French embassy in Denmark,"We thank C.

In the laboratory, healing is thought to be the result of thermally activated mechanisms that weld together micrometre-sized asperity contacts on the fault surface, but the relationship between laboratory measures of fault healing and the seismically observable properties of earthquakes is at present not well defined. Here we report on laboratory experiments and seismological observations that show how the spectral properties of earthquakes vary as a function of fault healing time. In the laboratory, we find that increased healing causes a disproportionately large amount of high-frequency seismic radiation to be produced during fault rupture. We observe a similar connection between earthquake spectra and recurrence time for repeating earthquake sequences on natural faults. Healing rates depend on pressure, temperature(4) and mineralogy(1), so the connection between seismicity and healing may help to explain recent observations of large megathrust earthquakes which indicate that energetic, high-frequency seismic radiation originates from locations that are distinct from the geodetically inferred locations of large-amplitude fault slip(5-7).","[McLaskey, Gregory C.; Glaser, Steven D.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Thomas, Amanda M.; Nadeau, Robert M.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley Seismol Lab, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","McLaskey, GC (reprint author), US Geol Survey, 345 Middlefield Rd,MS 977, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA.",gmclaskey@usgs.gov,"Nadeau, Robert/G-1884-2017","Nadeau, Robert/0000-0003-1255-0643","US NSF GRF; NSF [CMMI-1131582, EAR-0738342, EAR-0910322]","This paper was improved by suggestions from R.

Bees contribute approximately 80% of insect pollination, so it is important to understand and mitigate the causes of current declines in bee populations(4-6). Recent studies have implicated the role of pesticides in these declines, as exposure to these chemicals has been associated with changes in bee behaviour(7-11) and reductions in colony queen production(12). However, the key link between changes in individual behaviour and the consequent impact at the colony level has not been shown. Social bee colonies depend on the collective performance of many individual workers. Thus, although field-level pesticide concentrations can have subtle or sublethal effects at the individual level(8), it is not known whether bee societies can buffer such effects or whether it results in a severe cumulative effect at the colony level. Furthermore, widespread agricultural intensification means that bees are exposed to numerous pesticides when foraging(13-15), yet the possible combinatorial effects of pesticide exposure have rarely been investigated(16,17). Here we show that chronic exposure of bumblebees to two pesticides (neonicotinoid and pyrethroid) at concentrations that could approximate field-level exposure impairs natural foraging behaviour and increases worker mortality leading to significant reductions in brood development and colony success. We found that worker foraging performance, particularly pollen collecting efficiency, was significantly reduced with observed knock-on effects for forager recruitment, worker losses and overall worker productivity. Moreover, we provide evidence that combinatorial exposure to pesticides increases the propensity of colonies to fail.","[Gill, Richard J.; Ramos-Rodriguez, Oscar; Raine, Nigel E.] Univ London, Sch Biol Sci, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England","Gill, RJ (reprint author), Univ London, Sch Biol Sci, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England.",richard.gill@rhul.ac.uk; nigel.raine@rhul.ac.uk,,"Gill, Richard/0000-0001-9389-1284; Raine, Nigel/0000-0001-6343-2829","Insect Pollinator Initiative; Living with Environmental Change programme, Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); Wellcome Trust; Scottish Government; Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [BB/I000178/1]","We thank M.J.F.

Given their distant developmental origins, it is intriguing how the number of cortical interneurons is ultimately determined. One possibility, suggested by the neurotrophic hypothesis(1-5), is that cortical interneurons are overproduced, and then after their migration into cortex the excess interneurons are eliminated through a competition for extrinsically derived trophic signals. Here we characterize the developmental cell death of mouse cortical interneurons in vivo, in vitro and after transplantation. We found that 40% of developing cortical interneurons were eliminated through Bax (Bcl-2-associated X)-dependent apoptosis during postnatal life. When cultured in vitro or transplanted into the cortex, interneuron precursors died at a cellular age similar to that at which endogenous interneurons died during normal development. Over transplant sizes that varied 200-fold, a constant fraction of the transplanted population underwent cell death. The death of transplanted neurons was not affected by the cell-autonomous disruption of TrkB (tropomyosin kinase receptor B), the main neurotrophin receptor expressed by neurons of the central nervous system(6-8). Transplantation expanded the cortical interneuron population by up to 35%, but the frequency of inhibitory synaptic events did not scale with the number of transplanted interneurons. Taken together, our findings indicate that interneuron cell death is determined intrinsically, either cell-autonomously or through a population-autonomous competition for survival signals derived from other interneurons.","[Southwell, Derek G.; Jones, Daniel L.; Baraban, Scott C.; Alvarez-Buylla, Arturo] Univ Calif San Francisco, Grad Program Neurosci, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Southwell, Derek G.; Paredes, Mercedes F.; Galvao, Rui P.; Jones, Daniel L.; Sebe, Joy Y.; Tang, Yunshuo; Baraban, Scott C.; Alvarez-Buylla, Arturo] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Neurosci, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Southwell, Derek G.; Paredes, Mercedes F.; Galvao, Rui P.; Jones, Daniel L.; Sebe, Joy Y.; Tang, Yunshuo; Baraban, Scott C.; Alvarez-Buylla, Arturo] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Neurosurg, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Southwell, Derek G.; Paredes, Mercedes F.; Galvao, Rui P.; Jones, Daniel L.; Sebe, Joy Y.; Tang, Yunshuo; Rubenstein, John L.; Baraban, Scott C.; Alvarez-Buylla, Arturo] Univ Calif San Francisco, Eli & Edythe Broad Ctr Regenerat Med & Stem Cell, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Southwell, Derek G.; Tang, Yunshuo] Univ Calif San Francisco, Med Scientist Training Program, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Paredes, Mercedes F.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Neurol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Froemke, Robert C.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Coleman Mem Lab, Dept Otolaryngol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Froemke, Robert C.] Univ Calif San Francisco, WM Keck Fdn Ctr Integrat Neurosci, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Alfaro-Cervello, Clara; Garcia-Verdugo, Jose M.] Univ Valencia, CIBERNED, Inst Cavanilles, Valencia 46071, Spain; [Tang, Yunshuo] Univ Calif San Francisco, Biomed Sci Grad Program, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Rubenstein, John L.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Psychiat, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Southwell, DG (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosurg, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",dereksouthwell@gmail.com; abuylla@stemcell.ucsf.edu,"Garcia-Verdugo, Jose Manuel/L-8421-2017","Garcia-Verdugo, Jose Manuel/0000-0001-9872-6499; Baraban, Scott/0000-0003-1975-9781; Froemke, Robert/0000-0002-1230-6811","California Institute for Regenerative Medicine [TR2-01749]; National Institute of Neurologic Disorders and Stroke [F32NS061497]; John G.

However, the inability to readily modify the genome in a targeted fashion has been a bottleneck in the field. Here we show that improvements in artificial transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) provide a powerful new approach for targeted zebrafish genome editing and functional genomic applications(1-5). Using the GoldyTALEN modified scaffold and zebrafish delivery system, we show that this enhanced TALEN toolkit has a high efficiency in inducing locus-specific DNA breaks in somatic and germline tissues. At some loci, this efficacy approaches 100%, including biallelic conversion in somatic tissues that mimics phenotypes seen using morpholino-based targeted gene knockdowns(6). With this updated TALEN system, we successfully used single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides to precisely modify sequences at predefined locations in the zebrafish genome through homology-directed repair, including the introduction of a custom-designed EcoRV site and a modified loxP (mloxP) sequence into somatic tissue in vivo. We further show successful germline transmission of both EcoRV and mloxP engineered chromosomes. This combined approach offers the potential to model genetic variation as well as to generate targeted conditional alleles.","[Bedell, Victoria M.; Campbell, Jarryd M.; Poshusta, Tanya L.; Krug, Randall G., II; Penheiter, Sumedha G.; Ma, Alvin C.; Clark, Karl J.; Ekker, Stephen C.] Mayo Clin, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Rochester, MN 55905 USA; [Wang, Ying; Essner, Jeffrey J.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Genet Dev & Cell Biol, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Starker, Colby G.; Tan, Wenfang; Fahrenkrug, Scott C.; Carlson, Daniel F.; Voytas, Daniel F.] Univ Minnesota, Ctr Genome Engn, Dept Genet Cell Biol & Dev, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Starker, Colby G.; Tan, Wenfang; Fahrenkrug, Scott C.; Carlson, Daniel F.; Voytas, Daniel F.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Anim Sci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Ma, Alvin C.; Leung, Anskar Y.

Genome-wide association studies and subsequent meta-analyses of these two diseases(2,3) as separate phenotypes have implicated previously unsuspected mechanisms, such as autophagy(4), in their pathogenesis and showed that some IBD loci are shared with other inflammatory diseases(5). Here we expand on the knowledge of relevant pathways by undertaking a meta-analysis of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis genome-wide association scans, followed by extensive validation of significant findings, with a combined total of more than 75,000 cases and controls. We identify 71 new associations, for a total of 163 IBD loci, that meet genome-wide significance thresholds. Most loci contribute to both phenotypes, and both directional (consistently favouring one allele over the course of human history) and balancing (favouring the retention of both alleles within populations) selection effects are evident. Many IBD loci are also implicated in other immune-mediated disorders, most notably with ankylosing spondylitis and psoriasis. We also observe considerable overlap between susceptibility loci for IBD and mycobacterial infection. Gene co-expression network analysis emphasizes this relationship, with pathways shared between host responses to mycobacteria and those predisposing to IBD.","[Hui, Ken Y.; Cho, Judy H.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Jostins, Luke; Anderson, Carl A.; Barrett, Jeffrey C.] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Cambridge CB10 1HH, England; [Ripke, Stephan; Daly, Mark J.] Harvard Univ, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Sch Med, Analyt & Translat Genet Unit, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Ripke, Stephan; Daly, Mark J.] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Weersma, Rinse K.; De Jong, Dirk] Univ Groningen, Dept Gastroenterol & Hepatol, NL-9700 RB Groningen, Netherlands; [Mitrovic, Mitja] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Genet, NL-9700 RB Groningen, Netherlands; [Duerr, Richard H.; Baidoo, Leonard; Fransen, Karin; Regueiro, Miguel] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Gastroenterol Hepatol & Nutr, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; [Duerr, Richard H.] Univ Pittsburgh, Grad Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Human Genet, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; [McGovern, Dermot P.; Targan, Stephan R.; Taylor, Kent D.] F Widjaja Fdn Inflammatory Bowel, Los Angeles, CA 90048 USA; [McGovern, Dermot P.; Targan, Stephan R.; Taylor, Kent D.] Immunobiol Res Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90048 USA; [McGovern, Dermot P.; Haritunians, Talin; Rotter, Jerome I.; Taylor, Kent D.] Cedars Sinai Med Ctr, Inst Med Genet, Los Angeles, CA 90048 USA; [Lee, James C.; Parkes, Miles] Univ Cambridge, Addenbrookes Hosp, Inflammatory Bowel Dis Res Grp, Cambridge CB2 0QQ, England; [Schumm, L.

Schlafen (Slfn) genes are a subset of interferon-stimulated early response genes (ISGs) that are also induced directly by pathogens via the interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) pathway(1). However, many ISGs are of unknown or incompletely understood function. Here we show that human SLFN11 potently and specifically abrogates the production of retroviruses such as human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1). Our study revealed that SLFN11 has no effect on the early steps of the retroviral infection cycle, including reverse transcription, integration and transcription. Rather, SLFN11 acts at the late stage of virus production by selectively inhibiting the expression of viral proteins in a codon-usage-dependent manner. We further find that SLFN11 binds transfer RNA, and counteracts changes in the tRNA pool elicited by the presence of HIV. Our studies identified a novel antiviral mechanism within the innate immune response, in which SLFN11 selectively inhibits viral protein synthesis in HIV-infected cells by means of codon-bias discrimination.","[Li, Manqing; Kao, Elaine; Gao, Xia; Sandig, Hilary; Limmer, Kirsten; David, Michael] Univ Calif San Diego, Mol Biol Sect, Div Biol Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Pavon-Eternod, Mariana; Jones, Thomas E.; Pan, Tao] Univ Chicago, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Landry, Sebastien; Weitzman, Matthew D.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Genet Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [David, Michael] Univ Calif San Diego, Moores Canc Ctr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","David, M (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Mol Biol Sect, Div Biol Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",midavid@ucsd.edu,,,"NIH [AI81019, AI074967, P01AI090935, R01GM101982, R21AI088490, P30AI36214]; HINT Program [NIH P01AI090935]","We thank D.

Most of these elite controllers express the histocompatibility alleles HLA-B*57 or HLA-B*27 (ref. 3). These alleles remain by far the most robust associations with low concentrations of plasma virus(4,5), yet the mechanism of control in these individuals is not entirely clear. Here we vaccinate Indian rhesus macaques that express Mamu-B*08, an animal model for HLA-B*27-mediated elite control(6), with three Mamu-B*08-restricted CD8(+) T-cell epitopes, and demonstrate that these vaccinated animals control replication of the highly pathogenic clonal simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) mac239 virus. High frequencies of CD8(+) T cells against these Vif and Nef epitopes in the blood, lymph nodes and colon were associated with viral control. Moreover, the frequency of the CD8(+) T-cell response against the Nef RL10 epitope (Nef amino acids 137-146) correlated significantly with reduced acute phase viraemia. Finally, two of the eight vaccinees lost control of viral replication in the chronic phase, concomitant with escape in all three targeted epitopes, further implicating these three CD8(+) T-cell responses in the control of viral replication. Our findings indicate that narrowly targeted vaccine-induced virus-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses can control replication of the AIDS virus.","[Martins, Mauricio A.; Watkins, David I.] Univ Miami, Miller Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Miami, FL 33136 USA; [Mudd, Philip A.; Ericsen, Adam J.; Bean, Alex T.; Piaskowski, Shari M.; Weisgrau, Kim L.; Furlott, Jessica R.; Wilson, Nancy A.] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Madison, WI 53711 USA; [Mudd, Philip A.] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Med Scientist Training Program, Madison, WI 53705 USA; [Tully, Damien C.; Power, Karen A.; Seese, Aaron; Gladden, Adrianne D.; Allen, Todd M.] Ragon Inst MGH MIT & Harvard, Boston, MA 02129 USA; [Duan, Lijie; Haase, Ashley T.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Microbiol, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Kim, Young-il] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Med, Div Prevent Med, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; [Veloso de Santana, Marlon G.; Bonaldo, Myrna C.] Fiocruz MS, Inst Oswaldo Cruz, Lab Biol Mol Flavivirus, BR-21045900 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Rakasz, Eva; Capuano, Saverio, III; Wilson, Nancy A.] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Wisconsin Natl Primate Res Ctr, Madison, WI 53711 USA; [Galler, Ricardo] Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Inst Tecnol Imunobiol, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Allison, David B.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Biostat, Sect Stat Genet, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; [Piatak, Michael, Jr.; Lifson, Jeffrey D.] NCI, AIDS & Canc Virus Program, SAIC Frederick Inc, Frederick, MD 21702 USA","Watkins, DI (reprint author), Univ Miami, Miller Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Miami, FL 33136 USA.",dwatkins@med.miami.edu,"Bonaldo, Myrna/D-9494-2013; Vacinas, Inct/J-9431-2013; Galler, Ricardo/B-3280-2014; Allen, Todd/F-5473-2011; Veloso de Santana, Marlon Gilsepp/H-8146-2017","Veloso de Santana, Marlon Gilsepp/0000-0002-3427-841X; Martins, Mauricio/0000-0001-8336-216X; Ericsen, Adam/0000-0003-4176-8270; Allison, David/0000-0003-3566-9399","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R37 AI052056, RO1 AI076114, RR015371, HHSN261200800001E]; FAPERJ; INCTV; CNPq; MCT; FIOCRUZ","We would like to thank M.

Phosphate is indispensable and arsenate is toxic, but this extensive similarity raises the question whether arsenate may substitute for phosphate in certain niches(4,5). However, whether it is used or excluded, discriminating phosphate from arsenate is a paramount challenge. Enzymes that utilize phosphate, for example, have the same binding mode and kinetic parameters as arsenate, and the latter's presence therefore decouples metabolism(6,7). Can proteins discriminate between these two anions, and how would they do so? In particular, cellular phosphate uptake systems face a challenge in arsenate-rich environments. Here we describe a molecular mechanism for this process. We examined the periplasmic phosphate-binding proteins (PBPs) of the ABC-type transport system that mediates phosphate uptake into bacterial cells, including two PBPs from the arsenate-rich Mono Lake Halomonas strain GFAJ-1. All PBPs tested are capable of discriminating phosphate over arsenate at least 500-fold. The exception is one of the PBPs of GFAJ-1 that shows roughly 4,500-fold discrimination and its gene is highly expressed under phosphate-limiting conditions. Sub-angstrom-resolution structures of Pseudomonas fluorescens PBP with both arsenate and phosphate show a unique mode of binding that mediates discrimination. An extensive network of dipole-anion interactions(8,9), and of repulsive interactions, results in the 4% larger arsenate distorting a unique low-barrier hydrogen bond. These features enable the phosphate transport system to bind phosphate selectively over arsenate (at least 10(3) excess) even in highly arsenate-rich environments.","[Elias, Mikael; Wellner, Alon; Goldin-Azulay, Korina; Tawfik, Dan S.] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Biol Chem, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Chabriere, Eric] Univ Aix Marseille 2, CNRS, Fac Med & Pharm, Unite Rech Malad Infect & Trop Emergentes, F-13385 Marseille, France; [Vorholt, Julia A.; Erb, Tobias J.] ETH, Inst Microbiol, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland","Tawfik, DS (reprint author), Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Biol Chem, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel.",mikael.elias@weizmann.ac.il; tawfik@weizmann.ac.il,"Elias, Mikael/C-8484-2011; Erb, Tobias/J-5214-2013; Vorholt, Julia/K-3514-2016","Elias, Mikael/0000-0003-0406-7539; Erb, Tobias/0000-0003-3685-0894; ",Israel Science Foundation; Intra-European Fellowships Marie Curie program [252836]; Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule fellowship,"We thank G.

However, proteins are also subject to pressures deriving from the dynamics of the evolutionary process itself-the ability to tolerate mutation and to be adaptive to changing selection pressures(6-10). To understand the relationship of the sector architecture to these properties, we developed a high-throughput quantitative method for a comprehensive single-mutation study in which every position is substituted individually to every other amino acid. Using a PDZ domain (PSD95(pdz3)) model system, we show that sector positions are functionally sensitive to mutation, whereas non-sector positions are more tolerant to substitution. In addition, we find that adaptation to a new binding specificity initiates exclusively through variation within sector residues. A combination of just two sector mutations located near and away from the ligand-binding site suffices to switch the binding specificity of PSD95(pdz3) quantitatively towards a class-switching ligand. The localization of functional constraint and adaptive variation within the sector has important implications for understanding and engineering proteins.","[McLaughlin, Richard N., Jr.; Poelwijk, Frank J.; Raman, Arjun; Gosal, Walraj S.; Ranganathan, Rama] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Green Ctr Syst Biol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [McLaughlin, Richard N., Jr.; Poelwijk, Frank J.; Raman, Arjun; Gosal, Walraj S.; Ranganathan, Rama] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Pharmacol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA","Ranganathan, R (reprint author), Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Green Ctr Syst Biol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA.",rama.ranganathan@utsouthwestern.edu,"Gosal, Walraj/J-5260-2012","Gosal, Walraj/0000-0003-3396-1505; Poelwijk, Frank/0000-0002-5696-4357",University of Texas Southwestern Graduate School and Pharmacology Training Grant; Helen Hay Whitney Fellowship program; National Institutes of Health [R01EY018720-05]; Robert A.

The domestication of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.) ranks as one of the most important developments in history. However, its origins and domestication processes are controversial and have long been debated. Here we generate genome sequences from 446 geographically diverse accessions of the wild rice species Oryza rufipogon, the immediate ancestral progenitor of cultivated rice, and from 1,083 cultivated indica and japonica varieties to construct a comprehensive map of rice genome variation. In the search for signatures of selection, we identify 55 selective sweeps that have occurred during domestication. In-depth analyses of the domestication sweeps and genome-wide patterns reveal that Oryza sativa japonica rice was first domesticated from a specific population of O. rufipogon around the middle area of the Pearl River in southern China, and that Oryza sativa indica rice was subsequently developed from crosses between japonica rice and local wild rice as the initial cultivars spread into South East and South Asia. The domestication-associated traits are analysed through high-resolution genetic mapping. This study provides an important resource for rice breeding and an effective genomics approach for crop domestication research.","[Huang, Xuehui; Wang, Zi-Xuan; Wang, Ahong; Zhao, Qiang; Zhao, Yan; Liu, Kunyan; Lu, Hengyun; Li, Wenjun; Guo, Yunli; Lu, Yiqi; Zhou, Congcong; Fan, Danlin; Weng, Qijun; Zhu, Chuanrang; Huang, Tao; Zhang, Lei; Wang, Yongchun; Feng, Lei; Zhan, Qilin; Li, Canyang; Lu, Tingting; Feng, Qi; Han, Bin] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Biol Sci, Inst Plant Physiol & Ecol, Natl Ctr Gene Res, Shanghai 200233, Peoples R China; [Kurata, Nori; Wang, Zi-Xuan; Furuumi, Hiroyasu; Kubo, Takahiko; Miyabayashi, Toshie; Fujiyama, Asao; Toyoda, Atsushi] Natl Inst Genet, Plant Genet Lab, Mishima, Shizuoka 4118540, Japan; [Kurata, Nori; Wang, Zi-Xuan; Furuumi, Hiroyasu; Kubo, Takahiko; Miyabayashi, Toshie; Fujiyama, Asao; Toyoda, Atsushi] Natl Inst Genet, Comparat Genom Lab, Mishima, Shizuoka 4118540, Japan; [Wei, Xinghua; Yuan, Xiaoping; Xu, Qun; Dong, Guojun; Qian, Qian] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, China Natl Rice Res Inst, State Key Lab Rice Biol, Hangzhou 310006, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Li, Jiayang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Genet & Dev Biol, Natl Ctr Plant Gene Res, State Key Lab Plant Genom, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Han, Bin] Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing Inst Genom, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China","Han, B (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Biol Sci, Inst Plant Physiol & Ecol, Natl Ctr Gene Res, Shanghai 200233, Peoples R China.",bhan@ncgr.ac.cn,,"Han, Bin/0000-0001-8695-0274","National Bioresource Project; MEXT; Systems Functional Genetics Project of the Transdisciplinary Research Integration Center, ROIS, Japan; Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2011CB100205, 2012AA10A302, 2012AA10A304]; Ministry of Agriculture of China [2011ZX08009-002, 2011ZX08001-004]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31121063]; Chinese Academy of Sciences","We thank the China National Rice Research Institute for providing all cultivated rice germplasm and Chinese wild rice accessions.

Here we identify an alternative, Batf3-independent pathway in mice for CD8 alpha(+) dendritic cell development operating during infection with intracellular pathogens and mediated by the cytokines interleukin (IL)-12 and interferon-gamma. This alternative pathway results from molecular compensation for Batf3 provided by the related AP1 factors Batf, which also functions in T and B cells, and Batf2 induced by cytokines in response to infection. Reciprocally, physiological compensation between Batf and Batf3 also occurs in T cells for expression of IL-10 and CTLA4. Compensation among BATF factors is based on the shared capacity of their leucine zipper domains to interact with non-AP1 factors such as IRF4 and IRF8 to mediate cooperative gene activation. Conceivably, manipulating this alternative pathway of dendritic cell development could be of value in augmenting immune responses to vaccines.","[Tussiwand, Roxane; Lee, Wan-Ling; Murphy, Theresa L.; Mashayekhi, Mona; Wumesh, K.

In the brain, NTS modulates the activity of dopaminergic systems, opioid-independent analgesia, and the inhibition of food intake; in the gut, NTS regulates a range of digestive processes. Here we present the structure at 2.8 angstrom resolution of Rattus norvegicus NTSR1 in an active-like state, bound to NTS8-13, the carboxy-terminal portion of NTS responsible for agonist-induced activation of the receptor. The peptide agonist binds to NTSR1 in an extended conformation nearly perpendicular to the membrane plane, with the C terminus oriented towards the receptor core. Our findings provide, to our knowledge, the first insight into the binding mode of a peptide agonist to a GPCR and may support the development of non-peptide ligands that could be useful in the treatment of neurological disorders, cancer and obesity.","[White, Jim F.; Xu, Feng; Gvozdenovic-Jeremic, Jelena; Shah, Priyanka; Grisshammer, Reinhard] Natl Inst Neurol Disorders & Stroke, Membrane Prot Struct Funct Unit, NIH, US Dept HHS, Rockville, MD 20852 USA; [Noinaj, Nicholas] NIDDKD, Mol Biol Lab, NIH, US Dept HHS, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Shibata, Yoko; Tate, Christopher G.] MRC, Mol Biol Lab, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England; [Love, James; Kloss, Brian] New York Struct Biol Ctr, New York Consortium Membrane Prot Struct, Prot Prod Facil, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Shiloach, Joseph] NIDDKD, Biotechnol Core Lab, NIH, US Dept HHS, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Grisshammer, R (reprint author), Natl Inst Neurol Disorders & Stroke, Membrane Prot Struct Funct Unit, NIH, US Dept HHS, Rockville, MD 20852 USA.",rkgriss@helix.nih.gov,"Grisshammer, Reinhard/C-3089-2015","Tate, Christopher/0000-0002-2008-9183","National Institutes of Health (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke); National Institutes of Health (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases); Pfizer Global Research and Development; MRCT Development Gap Fund; UK Medical Research Council [MRC U105197215]; National Institutes of Health [U54GM075026]; NIH Roadmap grant [P50 GM073197]; US Department of Energy, Basic Energy Sciences, Office of Science [DE-AC02-06CH11357]","This research was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institutes of Health (J.F.W., J.G.-J., P.S. and R.G.: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke; N.N. and J.S.: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) and a joint grant from Pfizer Global Research and Development and the MRCT Development Gap Fund in addition to core funding from the UK Medical Research Council MRC U105197215 (Y.S., C.G.T.).

Previous measurements(8-12) were unable to pinpoint conclusively the dominant origin because they did not sample spatial scales that were sufficiently large to distinguish between these two possibilities. Here we report a measurement of the anisotropy power spectrum from subarcminute to one-degree angular scales, and find the clustering amplitude to be larger than predicted by the models based on the two existing explanations. As the shot-noise level of the power spectrum is consistent with that expected from faint galaxies, a new source population on the sky is not necessary to explain the observations. However, a physical mechanism that increases the clustering amplitude is needed. Motivated by recent results related to the extended stellar light profile in dark-matter haloes(13-15), we consider the possibility that the fluctuations originate from intrahalo stars of all galaxies. We find that the measured power spectrum can be explained by an intrahalo light fraction of 0.07 to 0.2 per cent relative to the total luminosity in dark-matter haloes of 10(9) to 10(12) solar masses at redshifts of about 1 to 4.","[Cooray, Asantha; Smidt, Joseph; De Bernardis, Francesco; Gong, Yan; Frazer, Christopher C.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Phys & Astron, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Stern, Daniel; Eisenhardt, Peter R.] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA; [Ashby, Matthew L.

However, during the quiescent periods between them(3), stresses may be relieved through competing processes, such as slowly flowing water between earthquakes(4) or thermally activated dislocation flow(5) between plastic bursts in crystals(6-8). Such smooth responses can in turn have marked effects on the avalanche properties(9). Here we report an experimental investigation of slowly compressed nickel microcrystals, covering three orders of magnitude in nominal strain rate, in which we observe unconventional quasi-periodic avalanche bursts and higher critical exponents as the strain rate is decreased. Our experiments are faithfully reproduced by analytic and computational dislocation avalanche modelling(10,11) that we have extended to incorporate dislocation relaxation, revealing the emergence of the self-organized avalanche oscillator: a novel critical state exhibiting oscillatory approaches towards a depinning critical point(12). This theory suggests that whenever avalanches compete with slow relaxation-in settings ranging from crystal microplasticity to earthquakes-dynamical quasi-periodic scale invariance ought to emerge.","[Papanikolaou, Stefanos] Yale Univ, Dept Mech Engn & Mat Sci, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Papanikolaou, Stefanos] Yale Univ, Dept Phys, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Dimiduk, Dennis M.; Uchic, Michael D.; Woodward, Christopher F.] USAF, Res Lab, Mat & Mfg Directorate, AFRL RXCM, Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433 USA; [Choi, Woosong; Sethna, James P.] Cornell Univ, Dept Phys, Atom & Solid State Phys Lab, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Zapperi, Stefano] CNR, IENI, I-20125 Milan, Italy; [Zapperi, Stefano] ISI Fdn, I-10126 Turin, Italy","Papanikolaou, S (reprint author), Yale Univ, Dept Mech Engn & Mat Sci, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",stefanos.papanikolaou@yale.edu,"Papanikolaou, Stefanos/C-9263-2011; Zapperi,  Stefano/C-9473-2009","Papanikolaou, Stefanos/0000-0001-5239-1275; Zapperi,  Stefano/0000-0001-5692-5465",DTRA [1-10-1-0021]; DOE-BES [DE-FG02-07ER-46393]; Air Force Office of Scientific Research; Materials and Manufacturing Directorate; ComplexityNet pilot project LOCAT,"We thank J.

Particularly challenging is the preparation of all-carbon quaternary stereocentres in aldol adducts(3); this difficulty is problematic because the aldol reaction represents one of the most valuable chemical transformations in organic synthesis(4). The main problem that limits the formation of these stereocentres is the absence of an efficient method of preparing stereodefined trisubstituted enolates in acyclic systems(5-8).

A changing Gulf Stream has the potential to thaw and convert hundreds of gigatonnes of frozen methane hydrate trapped below the sea floor into methane gas, increasing the risk of slope failure and methane release(3-9). How the Gulf Stream changes with time and what effect these changes have on methane hydrate stability is unclear. Here, using seismic data combined with thermal models, we show that recent changes in intermediate-depth ocean temperature associated with the Gulf Stream are rapidly destabilizing methane hydrate along a broad swathe of the North American margin. The area of active hydrate destabilization covers at least 10,000 square kilometres of the United States eastern margin, and occurs in a region prone to kilometre-scale slope failures. Previous hypothetical studies(3,5) postulated that an increase of five degrees Celsius in intermediate-depth ocean temperatures could release enough methane to explain extreme global warming events like the Palaeocene-Eocene thermal maximum (PETM) and trigger widespread ocean acidification(7). Our analysis suggests that changes in Gulf Stream flow or temperature within the past 5,000 years or so are warming the western North Atlantic margin by up to eight degrees Celsius and are now triggering the destabilization of 2.5 gigatonnes of methane hydrate (about 0.2 per cent of that required to cause the PETM). This destabilization extends along hundreds of kilometres of the margin and may continue for centuries. It is unlikely that the western North Atlantic margin is the only area experiencing changing ocean currents(10-12); our estimate of 2.5 gigatonnes of destabilizing methane hydrate may therefore represent only a fraction of the methane hydrate currently destabilizing globally. The transport from ocean to atmosphere of any methane released-and thus its impact on climate-remains uncertain.","[Phrampus, Benjamin J.; Hornbach, Matthew J.] So Methodist Univ, Huffington Dept Earth Sci, Dallas, TX 75275 USA","Phrampus, BJ (reprint author), So Methodist Univ, Huffington Dept Earth Sci, Dallas, TX 75275 USA.",bphrampus@mail.smu.edu,,"Phrampus, Benjamin/0000-0002-6405-3625",,,,30,49,54,4,123,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,25-Oct,2012,490,7421,,,,,527,+,,10.1038/nature11528,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,025NK,WOS:000310196200039,23099408.0,No,,,11/20/17,matthew j.,hornbach,na,na,na,na,na

The origin of this depletion is poorly understood(3-13). Here we show that more than one weight per cent of argon may be dissolved in MgSiO3 perovskite, the most abundant phase of Earth's lower mantle, whereas the xenon solubility in MgSiO3 perovskite is orders of magnitude lower. We therefore suggest that crystallization of perovskite from a magma ocean in the very early stages of Earth's history concentrated argon in the lower mantle. After most of the primordial atmosphere had been lost, degassing of the lower mantle replenished argon and krypton, but not xenon, in the atmosphere. Our model implies that the depletion of xenon relative to argon indicates that perovskite crystallized from a magma ocean in the early history of Earth and perhaps also Mars.","[Shcheka, Svyatoslav S.; Keppler, Hans] Univ Bayreuth, Bayer Geoinst, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany","Shcheka, SS (reprint author), Univ Bayreuth, Bayer Geoinst, POB 101251, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany.",svyatoslav.shcheka@uni-bayreuth.de,,,German Science Foundation (DFG) [SPP 1236],"This work was supported by the German Science Foundation (DFG, SPP 1236).

A sizable fraction of amino-acid substitutions seem to be fixed by positive selection(1-4), but it is unclear to what degree long-term protein evolution is constrained by epistasis, that is, instances when substitutions that are accepted in one genotype are deleterious in another. Here we obtain a quantitative estimate of the prevalence of epistasis in long-term protein evolution by relating data on amino-acid usage in 14 organelle proteins and 2 nuclear-encoded proteins to their rates of short-term evolution. We studied multiple alignments of at least 1,000 orthologues for each of these 16 proteins from species from a diverse phylogenetic background and found that an average site contained approximately eight different amino acids. Thus, without epistasis an average site should accept two-fifths of all possible amino acids, and the average rate of amino-acid substitutions should therefore be about three-fifths lower than the rate of neutral evolution. However, we found that the measured rate of amino-acid substitution in recent evolution is 20 times lower than the rate of neutral evolution and an order of magnitude lower than that expected in the absence of epistasis. These data indicate that epistasis is pervasive throughout protein evolution: about 90 per cent of all amino-acid substitutions have a neutral or beneficial impact only in the genetic backgrounds in which they occur, and must therefore be deleterious in a different background of other species. Our findings show that most amino-acid substitutions have different fitness effects in different species and that epistasis provides the primary conceptual framework to describe the tempo and mode of long-term protein evolution.","[Breen, Michael S.; Kemena, Carsten; Vlasov, Peter K.; Notredame, Cedric; Kondrashov, Fyodor A.] Ctr Genom Regulat, Bioinformat & Genom Programme, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Breen, Michael S.; Kemena, Carsten; Vlasov, Peter K.; Notredame, Cedric; Kondrashov, Fyodor A.] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Kondrashov, Fyodor A.] 23 Passeig Lluis Co, ICREA, Barcelona 08010, Spain","Kondrashov, FA (reprint author), Ctr Genom Regulat, Bioinformat & Genom Programme, 88 Dr Aiguader, Barcelona 08003, Spain.",fyodor.kondrashov@crg.es,"Kondrashov, Fyodor Alexeevich/H-6331-2015; Vlasov, Peter/O-6392-2015; Notredame, Cedric/G-3868-2010","Kondrashov, Fyodor Alexeevich/0000-0001-8243-4694; Vlasov, Peter/0000-0003-0489-4200; Notredame, Cedric/0000-0003-1461-0988",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation; European Union [KBBE2A222664]; ICREA,"The work was supported by Plan Nacional grants from the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation, to F.A.K. and C.N.

It senses indirectly bacterial flagellin and type III secretion systems, and responds by assembling an inflammasome complex that promotes caspase-1 activation and pyroptosis(1-6). Here we use knock-in mice expressing NLRC4 with a carboxy-terminal 3xFlag tag to identify phosphorylation of NLRC4 on a single, evolutionarily conserved residue, Ser 533, following infection of macrophages with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (also known as Salmonella typhimurium). Western blotting with a NLRC4 phospho-Ser 533 antibody confirmed that this post-translational modification occurs only in the presence of stimuli known to engage NLRC4 and not the related protein NLRP3 or AIM2. Nlrc4(-/-) macrophages reconstituted with NLRC4 mutant S533A, unlike those reconstituted with wild-type NLRC4, did not activate caspase-1 and pyroptosis in response to S. typhimurium, indicating that S533 phosphorylation is critical for NLRC4 inflammasome function. Conversely, phosphomimetic NLRC4 S533D caused rapid macrophage pyroptosis without infection. Biochemical purification of the NLRC4-phosphorylating activity and a screen of kinase inhibitors identified PRKCD (PKC delta) as a candidate NLRC4 kinase. Recombinant PKC delta phosphorylated NLRC4 S533 in vitro, immunodepletion of PKC delta from macrophage lysates blocked NLRC4 S533 phosphorylation in vitro, and Prkcd(-/-) macrophages exhibited greatly attenuated caspase-1 activation and IL-1 beta secretion specifically in response to S. typhimurium. Phosphorylation-defective NLRC4 S533A failed to recruit procaspase-1 and did not assemble inflammasome specks(7) during S. typhimurium infection, so phosphorylation of NLRC4 S533 probably drives conformational changes necessary for NLRC4 inflammasome activity and host innate immunity.","[Qu, Yan; Newton, Kim; Kayagaki, Nobuhiko; Dixit, Vishva M.] Genentech Inc, Dept Physiol Chem, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Misaghi, Shahram; Louie, Salina] Genentech Inc, Dept Early Stage Cell Culture, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Izrael-Tomasevic, Anita; Arnott, David] Genentech Inc, Dept Prot Chem, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Gilmour, Laurie L.; Cupp, James E.] Genentech Inc, Dept Immunol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Lamkanfi, Mohamed] VIB, Dept Med Prot Res, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Lamkanfi, Mohamed] Univ Ghent, Dept Biochem, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Liu, Jinfeng] Genentech Inc, Dept Bioinformat & Computat Biol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Koemueves, Laszlo] Genentech Inc, Dept Pathol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Monack, Denise] Stanford Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Dixit, VM (reprint author), Genentech Inc, Dept Physiol Chem, 1 DNA Way, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA.",dixit@gene.com,,"Liu, Jinfeng/0000-0002-0343-8222",,,,22,120,127,1,55,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,25-Oct,2012,490,7421,,,,,539,+,,10.1038/nature11429,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,025NK,WOS:000310196200042,22885697.0,No,,,11/20/17,vishva m.,dixit,na,na,na,na,na

IRF4 binds DNA weakly owing to a carboxy-terminal auto-inhibitory domain, but cooperative binding with factors such as PU.1 or SPIB in B cells increases binding affinity(3), allowing IRF4 to regulate genes containing ETS-IRF composite elements (EICEs; 5'-GGAAnnGAAA-3')(1). Here we show that in mouse CD4(+) T cells, where PU.1/SPIB expression is low, and in B cells, where PU.1 is well expressed, IRF4 unexpectedly can cooperate with activator protein-1 (AP1) complexes to bind to AP1-IRF4 composite (5'-TGAnTCA/GAAA-3') motifs that we denote as AP1-IRF composite elements (AICEs). Moreover, BATF-JUN family protein complexes cooperate with IRF4 in binding to AICEs in pre-activated CD4(+) T cells stimulated with IL-21 and in T(H)17 differentiated cells. Importantly, BATF binding was diminished in Irf4(-/-) T cells and IRF4 binding was diminished in Batf(-/-) T cells, consistent with functional cooperation between these factors. Moreover, we show that AP1 and IRF complexes cooperatively promote transcription of the Il10 gene, which is expressed in T(H)17 cells and potently regulated by IL-21. These findings reveal that IRF4 can signal via complexes containing ETS or AP1 motifs depending on the cellular context, thus indicating new approaches for modulating IRF4-dependent transcription.","[Li, Peng; Spolski, Rosanne; Liao, Wei; Wang, Lu; Leonard, Warren J.] NHLBI, Lab Mol Immunol, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Li, Peng; Spolski, Rosanne; Liao, Wei; Wang, Lu; Leonard, Warren J.] NHLBI, Ctr Immunol, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Murphy, Theresa L.; Murphy, Kenneth M.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Immunol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Murphy, Kenneth M.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, St Louis, MO 63110 USA","Li, P (reprint author), NHLBI, Lab Mol Immunol, NIH, Bldg 10, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",lip3@nhlbi.nih.gov; wjl@helix.nih.gov,,,"Division of Intramural Research, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NIH; Howard Hughes Medical Institute","This work was supported by the Division of Intramural Research, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NIH (P.L., R.S., W.L., L.W. and W.J.L.) and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (T.L.M. and K.M.M.).

Our data show that Ras activation and mitochondrial dysfunction cooperatively stimulate production of reactive oxygen species, which causes activation of c-Jun amino (N)-terminal kinase (JNK) signalling. JNK cooperates with oncogenic Ras to inactivate the Hippo pathway, leading to upregulation of its targets Unpaired (an interleukin-6 homologue) and Wingless (a Wnt homologue). Mitochondrial dysfunction in Ras-activated cells further cooperates with Ras signalling in neighbouring cells with normal mitochondrial function, causing benign tumours to exhibit metastatic behaviour.

In the field of pain, they led to important advances in basic research(3-6) and even to clinical applications(7,8). Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are generally considered principal players in the pain pathway(9), including in humans(10). A snake toxin activating peripheral ASICs in nociceptive neurons has been recently shown to evoke pain(11). Here we show that a new class of three-finger peptides from another snake, the black mamba, is able to abolish pain through inhibition of ASICs expressed either in central or peripheral neurons. These peptides, which we call mambalgins, are not toxic in mice but show a potent analgesic effect upon central and peripheral injection that can be as strong as morphine. This effect is, however, resistant to naloxone, and mambalgins cause much less tolerance than morphine and no respiratory distress. Pharmacological inhibition by mambalgins combined with the use of knockdown and knockout animals indicates that blockade of heteromeric channels made of ASIC1a and ASIC2a subunits in central neurons and of ASIC1b-containing channels in nociceptors is involved in the analgesic effect of mambalgins. These findings identify new potential therapeutic targets for pain and introduce natural peptides that block them to produce a potent analgesia.","[Diochot, Sylvie; Baron, Anne; Salinas, Miguel; Douguet, Dominique; Scarzello, Sabine; Dabert-Gay, Anne-Sophie; Debayle, Delphine; Friend, Valerie; Lazdunski, Michel; Lingueglia, Eric] CNRS, Inst Pharmacol Mol & Cellulaire, UMR 7275, F-06560 Valbonne, France; [Diochot, Sylvie; Baron, Anne; Salinas, Miguel; Douguet, Dominique; Scarzello, Sabine; Dabert-Gay, Anne-Sophie; Debayle, Delphine; Friend, Valerie; Lazdunski, Michel; Lingueglia, Eric] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, F-06560 Valbonne, France; [Diochot, Sylvie; Baron, Anne; Salinas, Miguel; Friend, Valerie; Lingueglia, Eric] LabEx Ion Channel Sci & Therapeut, F-06560 Valbonne, France; [Alloui, Abdelkrim] Univ Auvergne, Clermont Univ, NEURO DOL, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Alloui, Abdelkrim] INSERM, U1107, F-63001 Clermont Ferrand, France","Baron, A (reprint author), CNRS, Inst Pharmacol Mol & Cellulaire, UMR 7275, 660 Route Lucioles, F-06560 Valbonne, France.",baron@ipmc.cnrs.fr; lingueglia@ipmc.cnrs.fr,"LINGUEGLIA, Eric/F-5509-2013; BARON, Anne/N-5691-2016; SALINAS, Miguel/N-6380-2016; douguet, dominique/D-5644-2017","LINGUEGLIA, Eric/0000-0003-3902-3405; BARON, Anne/0000-0002-8026-6380; SALINAS, Miguel/0000-0002-7445-123X; ",Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale; Association Francaise contre les Myopathies; Agence Nationale de la Recherche; EMMAservice under European Union of the EC FP7 Capacities Specific Programme [227490],"We are grateful to M.

Much of our present knowledge derives from high-throughput techniques such as the yeast two-hybrid assay and affinity purification(3), as well as from manual curation of experiments on individual systems(4). A variety of computational approaches based, for example, on sequence homology, gene co-expression and phylogenetic profiles, have also been developed for the genome-wide inference of protein-protein interactions (PPIs)(5,6). Yet comparative studies suggest that the development of accurate and complete repertoires of PPIs is still in its early stages(7-9). Here we show that three-dimensional structural information can be used to predict PPIs with an accuracy and coverage that are superior to predictions based on non-structural evidence. Moreover, an algorithm, termed PrePPI, which combines structural information with other functional clues, is comparable in accuracy to high-throughput experiments, yielding over 30,000 high-confidence interactions for yeast and over 300,000 for human. Experimental tests of a number of predictions demonstrate the ability of the PrePPI algorithm to identify unexpected PPIs of considerable biological interest. The surprising effectiveness of three-dimensional structural information can be attributed to the use of homology models combined with the exploitation of both close and remote geometric relationships between proteins.","[Zhang, Qiangfeng Cliff; Petrey, Donald; Deng, Lei; Thu, Chan Aye; Maniatis, Tom; Califano, Andrea; Honig, Barry] Columbia Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Zhang, Qiangfeng Cliff; Petrey, Donald; Honig, Barry] Columbia Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Zhang, Qiangfeng Cliff; Petrey, Donald; Deng, Lei; Bisikirska, Brygida; Lefebvre, Celine; Califano, Andrea; Honig, Barry] Columbia Univ, Columbia Initiat Syst Biol, Ctr Computat Biol & Bioinformat, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Deng, Lei] Tongji Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, Shanghai 201804, Peoples R China; [Qiang, Li; Accili, Domenico] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Med, Naomi Berrie Diabet Ctr, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Shi, Yu; Hunter, Tony] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Mol & Cell Biol Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Lefebvre, Celine; Califano, Andrea] Columbia Univ, Inst Canc Genet, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Califano, Andrea] Columbia Univ, Dept Biomed Informat, New York, NY 10032 USA","Califano, A (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, 630 W 168th St, New York, NY 10032 USA.",califano@c2b2.columbia.edu; bh6@columbia.edu,"Zhang, Qiangfeng/C-2902-2011; dong, minghui/D-1806-2015; Lefebvre, Celine/E-6290-2013","Qiang, Li/0000-0001-8322-1797","National Institutes of Health [GM030518, GM094597, CA121852, DK057539, CA082683, R01NS043915]; China Scholarship Council [2010626059]","This work is supported by National Institutes of Health grants GM030518 and GM094597 (B.H.), CA121852 (A.C. and B.H.), DK057539 (D.A.), CA082683 (T.H.), R01NS043915 (T.M.).

Here, using mouse immunoglobulin-kappa (Ig kappa) as a model system, we demonstrate that although individual haematopoietic stem cells are characterized by allelic plasticity, early lymphoid lineage cells become committed to the choice of a single allele, and this decision is then stably maintained in a clonal manner that predetermines monoallelic rearrangement in B cells.

It also affects the absorption, distribution and clearance of cancer-unrelated drugs and xenobiotics. For these reasons, the structure and function of P-gp have been studied extensively for decades(3). Here we present biochemical characterization of P-gp from Caenorhabditis elegans and its crystal structure at a resolution of 3.4 angstroms. We find that the apparent affinities of P-gp for anticancer drugs actinomycin D and paclitaxel are approximately 4,000 and 100 times higher, respectively, in the membrane bilayer than in detergent. This affinity enhancement highlights the importance of membrane partitioning when a drug accesses the transporter in the membrane(4). Furthermore, the transporter in the crystal structure opens its drug pathway at the level of the membrane's inner leaflet. In the helices flanking the opening to the membrane, we observe extended loops that may mediate drug binding, function as hinges to gate the pathway or both. We also find that the interface between the transmembrane and nucleotide-binding domains, which couples ATP hydrolysis to transport, contains a ball-and-socket joint and salt bridges similar to the ATP-binding cassette importers(5), suggesting that ATP-binding cassette exporters and importers may use similar mechanisms to achieve alternating access for transport. Finally, a model of human P-gp derived from the structure of C. elegans P-gp not only is compatible with decades of biochemical analysis(6-12), but also helps to explain perplexing functional data regarding the Phe335Ala mutant(13,14). These results increase our understanding of the structure and function of this important molecule.","[Jin, Mi Sun; Chen, Jue] Purdue Univ, Dept Biol Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Oldham, Michael L.; Zhang, Qiuju; Chen, Jue] Howard Hughes Med Inst, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Chen, J (reprint author), Purdue Univ, Dept Biol Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",chenjue@purdue.edu,,,Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Purdue Center for Cancer Research [NCI CCSG CA23168]; National Research Foundation of Korea; International Human Frontier Science Program,"We thank the beamline staff of the GM/CA CAT at the Advanced Photon System for assistance with data collection, Y.-K.

During ageing, stem cell function declines. To what extent and by what means age-related changes within the niche contribute to this phenomenon are unknown. Here we demonstrate that the aged muscle stem cell niche, the muscle fibre, expresses Fgf2 under homeostatic conditions, driving a subset of satellite cells to break quiescence and lose their self-renewing capacity. We show in mice that relatively dormant aged satellite cells robustly express sprouty 1 (Spry1), an inhibitor of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signalling. Increasing FGF signalling in aged satellite cells under homeostatic conditions by removing Spry1 results in the loss of quiescence, satellite cell depletion and diminished regenerative capacity. Conversely, reducing niche-derived FGF activity through inhibition of Fgfr1 signalling or overexpression of Spry1 in satellite cells prevents their depletion. These experiments identify an age-dependent change in the stem cell niche that directly influences stem cell quiescence and function.","[Chakkalakal, Joe V.; Brack, Andrew S.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Regenerat Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Jones, Kieran M.; Basson, M.

Although the ABC domains (BtuD subunits) form the expected closed sandwich dimer, the membrane-spanning BtuC subunits adopt a new conformation, with the central translocation pathway sealed by a previously unrecognized cytoplasmic gate.

Simulations(4,5) show that the initial mass of Ti-44 synthesized in core-collapse supernovae is (0.02-2.5) x 10(-4) solar masses (M-circle dot). Hard X-rays and gamma-rays from the decay of this Ti-44 have been unambiguously observed from Cassiopeia A only(6-8), leading to the suggestion that values of the initial mass of Ti-44 near the upper bound of the predictions occur only in exceptional cases(9). For the remnant of supernova 1987A(10,11), an upper limit to the initial mass of Ti-44 of <10(-3)M(circle dot) has been obtained from direct X-ray observations(12), and an estimate of (1-2) x 10(-4)M(circle dot) has been made from infrared light curves and ultraviolet spectra by complex and model-dependent computations(13-15). Here we report observations of hard X-rays from the remnant of supernova 1987A in the narrow band containing two direct-escape lines of Ti-44 at 67.9 and 78.4 keV. The measured line fluxes imply that this decay provided sufficient energy to power the remnant at late times.

But how budgets of volatiles were set in planets, and the nature and extent of volatile-depletion of planetary bodies during the earliest stages of Solar System formation remain poorly understood(1,2). The Moon is considered to be volatile-depleted and so it has been predicted that volatile loss should have fractionated stable isotopes of moderately volatile elements(3). One such element, zinc, exhibits strong isotopic fractionation during volatilization in planetary rocks(4,5), but is hardly fractionated during terrestrial igneous processes(6), making it a powerful tracer of the volatile histories of planets. Here we present high-precision zinc isotopic and abundance data which show that lunar magmatic rocks are enriched in the heavy isotopes of zinc and have lower zinc concentrations than terrestrial or Martian igneous rocks. Conversely, Earth and Mars have broadly chondritic zinc isotopic compositions. We show that these variations represent large-scale evaporation of zinc, most probably in the aftermath of the Moon-forming event, rather than small-scale evaporation processes during volcanism. Our results therefore represent evidence for volatile depletion of the Moon through evaporation, and are consistent with a giant impact origin for the Earth and Moon.","[Paniello, Randal C.; Moynier, Frederic] Washington Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Paniello, Randal C.; Moynier, Frederic] Washington Univ, McDonnell Ctr Space Sci, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Day, James M.

Although fast, 180-picosecond, two-quantum-bit (two-qubit) operations can be realized using nearest-neighbour exchange coupling(4), a scalable, spin-based quantum computing architecture will almost certainly require long-range qubit interactions. Circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) allows spatially separated superconducting qubits to interact via a superconducting microwave cavity that acts as a 'quantum bus', making possible two-qubit entanglement and the implementation of simple quantum algorithms(5-7). Here we combine the cQED architecture with spin qubits by coupling an indium arsenide nanowire double quantum dot to a superconducting cavity(8,9). The architecture allows us to achieve a charge-cavity coupling rate of about 30 megahertz, consistent with coupling rates obtained in gallium arsenide quantum dots(10). Furthermore, the strong spin-orbit interaction of indium arsenide allows us to drive spin rotations electrically with a local gate electrode, and the charge-cavity interaction provides a measurement of the resulting spin dynamics. Our results demonstrate how the cQED architecture can be used as a sensitive probe of single-spin physics and that a spin-cavity coupling rate of about one megahertz is feasible, presenting the possibility of long-range spin coupling via superconducting microwave cavities.","[Petersson, K.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) offers extremely high spatial resolution (less than one angstrom) and the ability to provide systematic information from both real and reciprocal space. However, very few TEM studies(1-3) have been carried out on surfaces because the information from the bulk dominates the very weak signals originating from surfaces. Here we report an experimental approach to extract surface information effectively from a thickness series of electron energy-loss spectra containing different weights of surface signals, using a wedge-shaped sample. Using the (001) surface of the technologically important compound strontium titanate, SrTiO3 (refs 4-6), as a model system for validation, our method shows that surface spectra are sensitive to the atomic reconstruction and indicate bonding and crystal-field changes surrounding the surface Ti cations. Very good agreement can be achieved between the experimental surface spectra and crystal-field multiplet calculations based on the proposed atomic surface structure optimized by density functional calculations(3). The distorted TiO6-x units indicated by the proposed model can be viewed directly in our high-resolution scanning TEM images. We suggest that this approach be used as a general method to extract valuable spectroscopic information from surface atoms in parallel with high-resolution images in TEM.","[Zhu, Guo-zhen; Botton, Gianluigi A.] McMaster Univ, Canadian Ctr Electron Microscopy, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M1, Canada; [Zhu, Guo-zhen; Botton, Gianluigi A.] McMaster Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M1, Canada; [Radtke, Guillaume] Aix Marseille Univ, Fac Sci St Jerome, CNRS, IM2NP,UMR 7334,Case 262, F-13397 Marseille 20, France","Botton, GA (reprint author), McMaster Univ, Canadian Ctr Electron Microscopy, 1280 Main St W, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M1, Canada.",gbotton@mcmaster.ca,"Zhu, Guo-zhen/D-8913-2015",,NSERC; McMaster University,"We are grateful to NSERC for Discovery and Strategic Grants supporting this work.

Despite protective measures, however, worldwide losses of these ecosystems have accelerated in recent decades(1). Here we present data from a nine-year whole-ecosystem nutrient-enrichment experiment. Our study demonstrates that nutrient enrichment, a global problem for coastal ecosystems(2-4), can be a driver of salt marsh loss. We show that nutrient levels commonly associated with coastal eutrophication increased above-ground leaf biomass, decreased the dense, below-ground biomass of bank-stabilizing roots, and increased microbial decomposition of organic matter. Alterations in these key ecosystem properties reduced geomorphic stability, resulting in creek-bank collapse with significant areas of creek-bank marsh converted to unvegetated mud. This pattern of marsh loss parallels observations for anthropogenically nutrient-enriched marshes worldwide, with creek-edge and bay-edge marsh evolving into mudflats and wider creeks(5-7). Our work suggests that current nutrient loading rates to many coastal ecosystems have overwhelmed the capacity of marshes to remove nitrogen without deleterious effects. Projected increases in nitrogen flux to the coast, related to increased fertilizer use required to feed an expanding human population, may rapidly result in a coastal landscape with less marsh, which would reduce the capacity of coastal regions to provide important ecological and economic services.","[Deegan, Linda A.; Johnson, David Samuel; Peterson, Bruce J.] Marine Biol Lab, Ctr Ecosyst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Johnson, David Samuel] Sewanee Univ S, Dept Biol, Sewanee, TN 37383 USA; [Warren, R.

Unfortunately, long-term continuous records of ice-sheet variability in the Northern Hemisphere only are scarce because records of benthic O-18 content represent an integrated signal of changes in ice volume in both polar regions(2). However, variations in Northern Hemisphere ice sheets influence the Siberian High(3) (an atmospheric pressure system), so variations in the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM)-as recorded in the aeolian dust deposits on the Chinese Loess Plateau-can serve as a useful proxy of Arctic climate variability before the ice-core record begins. Here we present an EAWM proxy record using grain-size variations in two parallel loess sections representative of sequences across the whole of the Chinese Loess Plateau over the past 900,000 years. The results show that during periods of low eccentricity and precessional variability at approximately 400,000-year intervals, the grain-size-inferred intensity of the EAWM remains weak for up to 20,000 years after the end of the interglacial episode of high summer monsoon activity and strong pedogenesis. In contrast, there is a rapid increase in the EAWM after the end of most other interglacials. We conclude that, for both the 400,000-year interglacials, the weak EAWM winds maintain a mild, non-glacial climate at high northern latitudes for much longer than expected from the conventional loess and marine oxygen isotope records. During these times, the less-severe summer insolation minima at 65 degrees N (ref. 4) would have suppressed ice and snow accumulation, leading to a weak Siberian High and, consequently, weak EAWM winds.","[Hao, Qingzhen; Wang, Luo; Song, Yang; Xu, Bing; Guo, Zhengtang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geol & Geophys, Key Lab Cenozo Geol & Environm, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Oldfield, Frank; Bloemendal, Jan] Univ Liverpool, Sch Environm Sci, Liverpool L69 7ZT, Merseyside, England; [Peng, Shuzhen] Taishan Univ, Key Lab Tourism & Resources Environm Univ Shandon, Tai An 271021, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Qin, Li] China Three Gorges Museum, Chongqing Three Gorges Inst Paleoanthropol, Chongqing 400015, Peoples R China; [Song, Yang] Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Univ, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Qiao, Yansong] Chinese Acad Geol Sci, Inst Geomech, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China","Hao, QZ (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geol & Geophys, Key Lab Cenozo Geol & Environm, POB 9825, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",haoqz@mail.iggcas.ac.cn; oldfield.f@gmail.com,"Guo, Zhengtang/B-6854-2008; Hao, Qingzhen/E-4605-2010","Guo, Zhengtang/0000-0003-2259-9715; ",National Natural Science Foundation of China [41172323]; Ministry of Science and Technology [2010CB950204]; Ministry of Land and Resources [201211077]; Chinese Academy of Sciences,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant 41172323), Ministry of Science and Technology (grant 2010CB950204), Ministry of Land and Resources (grant 201211077), and the Chinese Academy of Sciences.",,30,72,93,28,120,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,18-Oct,2012,490,7420,,,,,393,396,,10.1038/nature11493,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,021XI,WOS:000309918500044,23034648.0,No,,,11/20/17,zhengtang,guo,na,na,na,na,na

A general feature of these neurons is their selectivity to specific features of the sensory stimulation(3-5). Various theories try to explain the manner in which these neurons are driven by their incoming sensory information(6-11). In all of these theories neurons are regarded as simple elements summing small biased inputs to create tuned output through the axosomatic amplification mechanism(12). However, the possible role of active dendritic integration(13-15) in further amplifying the sensory responses and sharpening the tuning curves of neurons(16-19) is disregarded. Our findings show that dendrites of layer 4 spiny stellate neurons in the barrel cortex can generate local and global multi-branch N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) spikes, which are the main regenerative events in these dendrites. In turn, these NMDA receptor (NMDAR) regenerative mechanisms can sum supralinearly the coactivated thalamocortical and corticocortical inputs. Using in vivo whole-cell recordings combined with an intracellular NMDAR blocker and membrane hyperpolarization, we show that dendritic NMDAR-dependent regenerative responses contribute substantially to the angular tuning of layer 4 neurons by preferentially amplifying the preferred angular directions over non-preferred angles. Taken together, these findings indicate that dendritic NMDAR regenerative amplification mechanisms contribute markedly to sensory responses and critically determine the tuning of cortical neurons.","[Lavzin, Maria; Rapoport, Sophia; Garion, Liora; Schiller, Jackie] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Rappaport Fac Med, Dept Physiol, IL-31096 Haifa, Israel; [Lavzin, Maria; Rapoport, Sophia; Garion, Liora; Schiller, Jackie] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Res Inst, IL-31096 Haifa, Israel; [Polsky, Alon] NINDS, Synapt Physiol Sect, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Schiller, J (reprint author), Technion Israel Inst Technol, Rappaport Fac Med, Dept Physiol, IL-31096 Haifa, Israel.",Jackie@tx.technion.ac.il,,"Poleg-Polsky, Alon/0000-0003-1327-5129",Israel Science Foundation (ISF); Rappaport Foundation,"We thank Y.

However, traumatic or chronic uncontrollable stress promotes the onset of major depressive disorder, in which acute stressors lose their motivational properties and are perceived as insurmountable impediments(2). Consequently, stress-induced depression is a debilitating human condition characterized by an affective shift from engagement of the environment to withdrawal(3). An emerging neurobiological substrate of depression and associated pathology is the nucleus accumbens, a region with the capacity to mediate a diverse range of stress responses by interfacing limbic, cognitive and motor circuitry(4). Here we report that corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), a neuropeptide released in response to acute stressors(5) and other arousing environmental stimuli(6), acts in the nucleus accumbens of naive mice to increase dopamine release through coactivation of the receptors CRFR1 and CRFR2. Remarkably, severe-stress exposure completely abolished this effect without recovery for at least 90 days. This loss of CRF's capacity to regulate dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens is accompanied by a switch in the reaction to CRF from appetitive to aversive, indicating a diametric change in the emotional response to acute stressors. Thus, the current findings offer a biological substrate for the switch in affect which is central to stress-induced depressive disorders.","[Lemos, Julia C.; Wanat, Matthew J.; Hollon, Nick G.; Phillips, Paul E.

Mammalian haploids are restricted to germline cells and are occasionally found in tumours with massive chromosome loss(2,3). Recent success in establishing haploid embryonic stem (ES) cells in medaka fish(4) and mice(5,6) raised the possibility of using engineered mammalian haploid cells in genetic studies. However, the availability and functional characterization of mammalian haploid ES cells are still limited. Here we show that mouse androgenetic haploid ES (ahES) cell lines can be established by transferring sperm into an enucleated oocyte. The ahES cells maintain haploidy and stable growth over 30 passages, express pluripotent markers, possess the ability to differentiate into all three germ layers in vitro and in vivo, and contribute to germlines of chimaeras when injected into blastocysts. Although epigenetically distinct from sperm cells, the ahES cells can produce viable and fertile progenies after intracytoplasmic injection into mature oocytes.

Hypotheses explaining the acquired resistance to ACTs include the selection of antigen-deficient tumour cell variants(3-5) and the induction of T-cell tolerance(6). However, the lack of appropriate experimental melanoma models has so far impeded clear insights into the underlying mechanisms. Here we establish an effective ACT protocol in a genetically engineered mouse melanoma model that recapitulates tumour regression, remission and relapse as seen in patients. We report the unexpected observation that melanomas acquire ACT resistance through an inflammation-induced reversible loss of melanocytic antigens. In serial transplantation experiments, melanoma cells switch between a differentiated and a dedifferentiated phenotype in response to T-cell-driven inflammatory stimuli. We identified the proinflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha as a crucial factor that directly caused reversible dedifferentiation of mouse and human melanoma cells. Tumour cells exposed to TNF-alpha were poorly recognized by T cells specific for melanocytic antigens, whereas recognition by T cells specific for non-melanocytic antigens was unaffected or even increased. Our results demonstrate that the phenotypic plasticity of melanoma cells in an inflammatory microenvironment contributes to tumour relapse after initially successful T-cell immunotherapy. On the basis of our work, we propose that future ACT protocols should simultaneously target melanocytic and non-melanocytic antigens to ensure broad recognition of both differentiated and dedifferentiated melanoma cells, and include strategies to sustain T-cell effector functions by blocking immune-inhibitory mechanisms in the tumour microenvironment.","[Landsberg, Jennifer; Kohlmeyer, Judith; Renn, Marcel; Bald, Tobias; Rogava, Meri; Cron, Mira; Tueting, Thomas] Univ Bonn, Dept Dermatol & Allergy, Lab Expt Dermatol, D-53105 Bonn, Germany; [Fatho, Martina; Lennerz, Volker; Woelfel, Thomas] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Univ Med Ctr, Dept Med 3, D-55101 Mainz, Germany; [Hoelzel, Michael] Univ Bonn, Unit RNA Biol, Dept Clin Chem & Clin Pharmacol, D-53105 Bonn, Germany","Tuting, T (reprint author), Univ Bonn, Dept Dermatol & Allergy, Lab Expt Dermatol, D-53105 Bonn, Germany.",thomas.tueting@ukb.uni-bonn.de,"Wolfel, Thomas/G-6519-2012","Bald, Tobias/0000-0003-0061-235X","DFG [SFB832, SFB704, SFB 432]; Deutsche Krebshilfe (P9 in the Melanoma Research Network); BONFOR","We would like to thank G.

Antibodies against the HIV-1 envelope variable loops 1 and 2 (Env V1 and V2) correlated inversely with infection risk(2). We proposed that vaccine-induced immune responses against V1/V2 would have a selective effect against, or sieve, HIV-1 breakthrough viruses. A total of 936 HIV-1 genome sequences from 44 vaccine and 66 placebo recipients were examined. We show that vaccine-induced immune responses were associated with two signatures in V2 at amino acid positions 169 and 181. Vaccine efficacy against viruses matching the vaccine at position 169 was 48% (confidence interval 18% to 66%; P = 0.0036), whereas vaccine efficacy against viruses mismatching the vaccine at position 181 was 78% (confidence interval 35% to 93%; P = 0.0028). Residue 169 is in a cationic glycosylated region recognized by broadly neutralizing and RV144-derived antibodies. The predicted distance between the two signature sites (21 +/- 7 angstrom) and their match/mismatch dichotomy indicate that multiple factors may be involved in the protection observed in RV144. Genetic signatures of RV144 vaccination in V2 complement the finding of an association between high V1/V2-binding antibodies and reduced risk of HIV-1 acquisition, and provide evidence that vaccine-induced V2 responses plausibly had a role in the partial protection conferred by the RV144 regimen.","[Rolland, Morgane; Tovanabutra, Sodsai; Sanders-Buell, Eric; Bose, Meera; Howell, Shana; Bates, Adam; Lazzaro, Michelle; O'Sullivan, Annemarie; Lei, Esther; Bradfield, Andrea; Ibitamuno, Grace; O'Connell, Robert J.; Robb, Merlin L.; Michael, Nelson L.; Kim, Jerome H.] US Mil HIV Res Program, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA; [Edlefsen, Paul T.; Hertz, Tomer; deCamp, Allan C.; Magaret, Craig A.; Ahmed, Hasan; Juraska, Michal; Gilbert, Peter B.] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Vaccine & Infect Dis Div, Stat Ctr HIV AIDS Res & Prevent, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Larsen, Brendan B.; Chen, Lennie; Konopa, Philip; Nariya, Snehal; Stoddard, Julia N.; Wong, Kim; Zhao, Hong; Deng, Wenjie; Maust, Brandon S.; Mullins, James I.] Univ Washington, Dept Microbiol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Carrico, Chris; Menis, Sergey; Schief, William R.] Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Carrico, Chris; Menis, Sergey; Schief, William R.] Scripps Res Inst, IAVI Neutralizing Antibody Ctr, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Carrico, Chris; Menis, Sergey; Schief, William R.] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Immunol & Microbial Sci, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Assawadarachai, Vatcharain; deSouza, Mark S.; Nitayaphan, Sorachai] Royal Thai Army Component, AFRIMS, Bangkok 10400, Thailand; [Rerks-Ngarm, Supachai] Thai Minist Publ Hlth, Nonthaburi 11000, Thailand; [McLellan, Jason S.; Georgiev, Ivelin; Kwong, Peter D.] NIAID, Vaccine Res Ctr, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Carlson, Jonathan M.] Microsoft Res, Redmond, WA 98052 USA","Rolland, M (reprint author), US Mil HIV Res Program, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA.",mrolland@hivresearch.org,"Hertz, Tomer/S-5744-2016","Hertz, Tomer/0000-0002-0561-1578; Carrico, Chris/0000-0003-0939-9006","US Army Medical Research and Material Command (USAMRMC) [Y1-AI-2642-12]; National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [Y1-AI-2642-12]; Henry M.

Type 1 interferons (IFN-I) are crucial mediators of antiviral responses(1) and their transcription is regulated by a variety of transcription factors(2); principal among these is the family of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs)(3). The IRF gene regulatory networks are complex and contain multiple feedback loops. The tools of systems biology are well suited to elucidate the complex interactions that give rise to precise coordination of the interferon response. Here we have used an unbiased systems approach to predict that a member of the forkhead family of transcription factors, FOXO3, is a negative regulator of a subset of antiviral genes. This prediction was validated using macrophages isolated from Foxo3-null mice. Genome-wide location analysis combined with gene deletion studies identified the Irf7 gene as a critical target of FOXO3. FOXO3 was identified as a negative regulator of Irf7 transcription and we have further demonstrated that FOXO3, IRF7 and IFN-I forma coherent feed-forward regulatory circuit. Our data suggest that the FOXO3-IRF7 regulatory circuit represents a novel mechanism for establishing the requisite set points in the interferon pathway that balances the beneficial effects and deleterious sequelae of the antiviral response.","[Litvak, Vladimir; Ratushny, Alexander V.; Lampano, Aaron E.; Schmitz, Frank; Aitchison, John D.; Aderem, Alan] Seattle Biomed Res Inst, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Ratushny, Alexander V.; Huang, Albert C.; Raman, Ayush; Aitchison, John D.] Inst Syst Biol, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Rust, Alistair G.] Welcome Trust Sanger Inst, Cambridge CB10 1HH, England; [Bergthaler, Andreas] Austrian Acad Sci, Res Ctr Mol Med, A-1090 Vienna, Austria","Aderem, A (reprint author), Seattle Biomed Res Inst, 4 Nickerson St, Seattle, WA 98109 USA.",alan.aderem@seattlebiomed.org,,"Rust, Alistair/0000-0001-7287-192X; Bergthaler, Andreas/0000-0003-0597-1976","National Institutes of Health [R01AI025032, R01AI032972, HHSN272200700038C, HHSN272200800058C, U54GM103511]","We thank K.

Excess lipid deposition in peripheral tissues impairs insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake, and has been proposed to contribute to the pathology of type 2 diabetes(3-5). However, few treatment options exist that directly target ectopic lipid accumulation(6). Recently it was found that vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGF-B) controls endothelial uptake and transport of fatty acids in heart and skeletal muscle(7). Here we show that decreased VEGF-B signalling in rodent models of type 2 diabetes restores insulin sensitivity and improves glucose tolerance. Genetic deletion of Vegfb in diabetic db/db mice prevented ectopic lipid deposition, increased-muscle glucose uptake and maintained normoglycaemia. Pharmacological inhibition of VEGF-B signalling by antibody administration to db/db mice enhanced glucose tolerance, preserved pancreatic islet architecture, improved beta-cell function and ameliorated dyslipidaemia, key elements of type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. The potential use of VEGF-B neutralization in type 2 diabetes was further elucidated in rats fed a high-fat diet, in which it normalized insulin sensitivity and increased glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and heart. Our results demonstrate that the vascular endothelium can function as an efficient barrier to excess muscle lipid uptake even under conditions of severe obesity and type 2 diabetes, and that this barrier can be maintained by inhibition of VEGF-B signalling. We propose VEGF-B antagonism as a novel pharmacological approach for type 2 diabetes, targeting the lipid-transport properties of the endothelium to improve muscle insulin sensitivity and glucose disposal.","[Hagberg, Carolina E.; Mehlem, Annika; Falkevall, Annelie; Muhl, Lars; Nyqvist, Daniel; Eriksson, Ulf] Karolinska Inst, Dept Med Biochem & Biophys, Div Vasc Biol, Tissue Biol Grp, SE-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Hagberg, Carolina E.; Falkevall, Annelie; Muhl, Lars] Karolinska Inst, Stockholm Branch, Ludwig Inst Canc Res Ltd, SE-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Fam, Barbara C.; Proietto, Joseph; Andrikopoulos, Sofianos] Univ Melbourne, Dept Med AH, Heidelberg, Vic 3091, Australia; [Ortsater, Henrik; Sjoholm, Ake] Karolinska Inst, Dept Clin Sci & Educ, Diabet Res Unit, SE-11883 Stockholm, Sweden; [Scotney, Pierre; Nash, Andrew] CSL Ltd, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia; [Samen, Erik; Lu, Li; Stone-Elander, Sharon] Karolinska Univ Hosp, Dept Neuroradiol, SE-17176 Stockholm, Sweden; [Samen, Erik; Lu, Li; Stone-Elander, Sharon] Karolinska Univ Hosp, Karolinska Expt Res & Imaging Ctr, SE-17176 Stockholm, Sweden; [Samen, Erik; Stone-Elander, Sharon] Karolinska Inst, SE-17176 Stockholm, Sweden","Eriksson, U (reprint author), Karolinska Inst, Dept Med Biochem & Biophys, Div Vasc Biol, Tissue Biol Grp, SE-17177 Stockholm, Sweden.",ulf.pe.eriksson@ki.se,,"Hagberg, Carolina/0000-0002-5497-2855; Nyqvist, Daniel/0000-0002-6527-6716",Frans Wilhelm och Waldemar von Frenckells Fond; Wilhelm och Else Stockmanns Stiftelse; Swedish Society for Medical Research; Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research; Novo Nordisk Foundation; Swedish Cancer Foundation; Swedish Research Council; Torsten och Ragnar Soderbergs Stiftelser; Dr Peter Wallenbergs Foundation for Economics and Technology; Swedish Heart and Lung Foundation; Diabetes Foundation; Karolinska Institutet,"We thank S.

Bacterial transcription-coupled repair is initiated when RNA polymerase stalled at a DNA lesion is removed by Mfd, an ATP-dependent DNA translocase(1-3). Here we use single-molecule DNA nanomanipulation to observe the dynamic interactions of Escherichia coli Mfd with RNA polymerase elongation complexes stalled by a cyclopyrimidine dimer or by nucleotide starvation. We show that Mfd acts by catalysing two irreversible, ATP-dependent transitions with different structural, kinetic and mechanistic features. Mfd remains bound to the DNA in a long-lived complex that could act as a marker for sites of DNA damage, directing assembly of subsequent DNA repair factors.

Requiring better reporting of animal studies will raise awareness of the importance of rigorous study design to accelerate scientific progress.","[Landis, Story C.; Finkelstein, Robert; Gubitz, Amelie K.; Koroshetz, Walter; Porter, John D.; Utz, Ursula; Silberberg, Shai D.] Natl Inst Neurol Disorders & Stroke, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Amara, Susan G.] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Asadullah, Khusru] Bayer HealthCare, D-13342 Berlin, Germany; [Austin, Chris P.] NIH, Natl Ctr Adv Translat Sci, Rockville, MD 20854 USA; [Blumenstein, Robi] CHDI Management CHDI Fdn, New York, NY 10001 USA; [Bradley, Eileen W.] NIH, Ctr Review, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Crystal, Ronald G.] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Genet Med, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Darnell, Robert B.] Rockefeller Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Ferrante, Robert J.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Neurol Surg, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Fillit, Howard] Alzheimers Drug Discovery Fdn, New York, NY 10019 USA; [Fisher, Marc] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Worcester, MA 01545 USA; [Gendelman, Howard E.] Univ Nebraska Med Ctr, Dept Pharmacol & Expt Neurosci, Omaha, NE 68198 USA; [Golub, Robert M.] JAMA, Chicago, IL 60654 USA; [Goudreau, John L.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Neurol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Gross, Robert A.] Univ Rochester, Med Ctr, Dept Neurol, Rochester, NY 14642 USA; [Hesterlee, Sharon E.] Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy, Hackensack, NJ 07601 USA; [Howells, David W.] Univ Melbourne, Florey Inst Neurosci & Mental Hlth, Heidelberg, Vic 3081, Australia; [Huguenard, John] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kelner, Katrina] AAAS, Washington, DC USA; [Krainc, Dimitri] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Neurol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Lazic, Stanley E.] F Hoffmann La Roche & Co Ltd, CH-4070 Basel, Switzerland; [Levine, Michael S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychiat & Biobehav Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Macleod, Malcolm R.] Univ Edinburgh, Western Gen Hosp, Dept Clin Neurosci, Edinburgh EH4 2XU, Midlothian, Scotland; [Moxley, Richard T., III] Univ Rochester, Med Ctr, Sch Med & Dent, Rochester, NY 14642 USA; [McCall, John M.] PharMac LLC, Boca Grande, FL 33921 USA; [Narasimhan, Kalyani] Nat Neurosci, New York, NY 10013 USA; [Noble, Linda J.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Neurol Surg, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Perrin, Steve] ALS Therapy Dev Inst, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Steward, Oswald] Univ Calif Irvine, Reeve Irvine Res Ctr, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Unger, Ellis] US FDA, Off New Drugs, Ctr Drug Evaluat & Res, Silver Spring, MD 20993 USA","Silberberg, SD (reprint author), Natl Inst Neurol Disorders & Stroke, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",silberbs@ninds.nih.gov,"Lazic, Stanley/F-1160-2011; Huguenard, John/I-5016-2012; Darnell, Robert/B-9022-2008","Huguenard, John/0000-0002-6950-1191; Darnell, Robert/0000-0002-5134-8088; Steward, Oswald/0000-0001-7069-8756; Macleod, Malcolm Robert/0000-0001-9187-9839",NINDS,Funded by NINDS.,,64,440,446,7,99,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-Oct,2012,490,7419,,,,,187,191,,10.1038/nature11556,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,019IY,WOS:000309733300036,23060188.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,shai d.,silberberg,na,na,na,na,na

They can be 'trapped' to give products that are used as pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, dyes, polymers and other fine chemicals. Here we explore a strategy that unites the de novo generation of benzynes-through a hexadehydro-Diels-Alder reaction-with their in situ elaboration into structurally complex benzenoid products. In the hexadehydro-Diels-Alder reaction, a 1,3-diyne is engaged in a [4+2] cycloisomerization with a 'diynophile' to produce the highly reactive benzyne intermediate. The reaction conditions for this simple, thermal transformation are notable for being free of metals and reagents. The subsequent and highly efficient trapping reactions increase the power of the overall process. Finally, we provide examples of how this de novo benzyne generation approach allows new modes of intrinsic reactivity to be revealed.","[Hoye, Thomas R.; Baire, Beeraiah; Niu, Dawen; Willoughby, Patrick H.; Woods, Brian P.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Chem, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Hoye, TR (reprint author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Chem, 207 Pleasant St SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",hoye@umn.edu,"Niu, Dawen/M-4910-2013","Niu, Dawen/0000-0002-5114-4413","National Science Foundation; National Institutes of Health [GM65597, CA76497]",P.H.W. thanks the National Science Foundation for a graduate research fellowship.

In recent years, intensification of heat waves has caused a surge of heat-stroke fatalities. The mechanisms underlying heat-related pathology are poorly understood. Here we show that heat stroke triggers pervasive necrotic cell death and neurodegeneration in Caenorhabditis elegans. Preconditioning of animals at a mildly elevated temperature strongly protects from heat-induced necrosis. The heat-shock transcription factor HSF-1 and the small heat-shock protein HSP-16.1 mediate cytoprotection by preconditioning. HSP-16.1 localizes to the Golgi, where it functions with the Ca2+- and Mn2+-transporting ATPase PMR-1 to maintain Ca2+ homeostasis under heat stroke. Preconditioning also suppresses cell death inflicted by diverse insults, and protects mammalian neurons from heat cytotoxicity. These findings reveal an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that defends against diverse necrotic stimuli, and may be relevant to heat stroke and other pathological conditions involving necrosis in humans.","[Kourtis, Nikos; Nikoletopoulou, Vassiliki; Tavernarakis, Nektarios] Fdn Res & Technol, Inst Mol Biol & Biotechnol, Iraklion 71110, Crete, Greece","Tavernarakis, N (reprint author), Fdn Res & Technol, Inst Mol Biol & Biotechnol, Iraklion 71110, Crete, Greece.",tavernarakis@imbb.forth.gr,"Tavernarakis, Nektarios/B-9684-2013","Tavernarakis, Nektarios/0000-0002-5253-1466",National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH); National Bioresource Project in Japan; European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) Long Term Fellowship; European Research Council (ERC); European Commission 7th Framework Programme,"We thank K.

However, fundamental features of the nervous system emerge before sensory experience is possible. Thus, activity-dependent development occurring before the onset of experience must be driven by spontaneous activity, but the origin and nature of activity in vivo remains largely untested. Here we use optical methods to show in live neonatal mice that waves of spontaneous retinal activity are present and propagate throughout the entire visual system before eye opening. This patterned activity encompassed the visual field, relied on cholinergic neurotransmission, preferentially initiated in the binocular retina and exhibited spatiotemporal correlations between the two hemispheres. Retinal waves were the primary source of activity in the midbrain and primary visual cortex, but only modulated ongoing activity in secondary visual areas. Thus, spontaneous retinal activity is transmitted through the entire visual system and carries patterned information capable of guiding the activity-dependent development of complex intra-and inter-hemispheric circuits before the onset of vision.","[Ackman, James B.; Burbridge, Timothy J.; Crair, Michael C.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, New Haven, CT 06510 USA","Crair, MC (reprint author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, 333 Cedar St, New Haven, CT 06510 USA.",michael.crair@yale.edu,,"Ackman, James/0000-0003-0802-6080","US National Institutes of Health (NIH) [P30 EY000785, R01 EY015788, T32 NS007224, T15 LM070506, T32 EY017353]; family of William Ziegler III","We thank R.

In the visual cortex, for example, stimulation of a pyramidal cell's receptive-field surround can attenuate the cell's response to a stimulus in the centre of its receptive field, a phenomenon called surround suppression. Whether cortical circuits contribute to surround suppression or whether the phenomenon is entirely relayed from earlier stages of visual processing is debated. Here we show that, in contrast to pyramidal cells, the response of somatostatin-expressing inhibitory neurons (SOMs) in the superficial layers of the mouse visual cortex increases with stimulation of the receptive-field surround. This difference results from the preferential excitation of SOMs by horizontal cortical axons. By perturbing the activity of SOMs, we show that these neurons contribute to pyramidal cells' surround suppression. These results establish a cortical circuit for surround suppression and attribute a particular function to a genetically defined type of inhibitory neuron.","[Adesnik, Hillel; Bruns, William; Scanziani, Massimo] Univ Calif San Diego, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Ctr Neural Circuits & Behav, Neurobiol Sect, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Adesnik, Hillel; Bruns, William; Scanziani, Massimo] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Neurosci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Taniguchi, Hiroki; Huang, Z.

The shell originates from a thermal pulse during which the star underwent a brief period of increased mass loss(3,4). It has hitherto been impossible to constrain observationally the timescales and mass-loss properties during and after a thermal pulse-parameters that determine the lifetime of the asymptotic giant branch and the amount of elements returned by the star. Here we report observations of CO emission from the circumstellar envelope and shell around R Sculptoris with an angular resolution of 1.3 ''. What was previously thought to be only a thin, spherical shell with a clumpy structure is revealed to also contain a spiral structure. Spiral structures associated with circumstellar envelopes have been previously seen, leading to the conclusion that the systems must be binaries(5-8). Combining the observational data with hydrodynamic simulations, we conclude that R Sculptoris is a binary system that underwent a thermal pulse about 1,800 years ago, lasting approximately 200 years. About 3 x 10(-3) solar masses of material were ejected at a velocity of 14.3 km s(-1) and at a rate around 30 times higher than the pre-pulse mass-loss rate. This shows that about three times more mass was returned to the interstellar medium during and immediately after the pulse than previously thought.","[Maercker, M.; Humphreys, E.; Wittkowski, M.] European So Observ, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Maercker, M.; Ramstedt, S.] Univ Bonn, Argelander Inst Astron, D-53121 Bonn, Germany; [Mohamed, S.] S African Astron Observ, ZA-7935 Cape Town, Western Cape, South Africa; [Vlemmings, W.

Although information on the atomic rearrangement at graphene grain boundaries can be obtained using transmission electron microscopy(3,4) and scanning tunnelling microscopy(2,5-8), large-scale information regarding the distribution of graphene grain boundaries is not easily accessible. Here we use optical microscopy to observe the grain boundaries of large-area graphene (grown on copper foil) directly, without transfer of the graphene. This imaging technique was realized by selectively oxidizing the underlying copper foil through graphene grain boundaries functionalized with O and OH radicals generated by ultraviolet irradiation under moisture-rich ambient conditions: selective diffusion of oxygen radicals through OH-functionalized defect sites was demonstrated by density functional calculations. The sheet resistance of large-area graphene decreased as the graphene grain sizes increased, but no strong correlation with the grain size of the copper was revealed, in contrast to a previous report(9). Furthermore, the influence of graphene grain boundaries on crack propagation (initialized by bending) and termination was clearly visualized using our technique. Our approach can be used as a simple protocol for evaluating the grain boundaries of other two-dimensional layered structures, such as boron nitride and exfoliated clays.","[Dinh Loc Duong; Chae, Seung Jin; Lee, Young Hee] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Sungkyunkwan Adv Inst Nanotechnol, Suwon 440746, South Korea; [Dinh Loc Duong; Han, Gang Hee; Gunes, Fethullah; Kim, Eun Sung; Kim, Sung Tae; Kim, Heetae; Quang Huy Ta; So, Kang Pyo; Yoon, Seok Jun; Chae, Seung Jin; Jo, Young Woo; Chae, Sang Hoon; Lim, Seong Chu; Choi, Jae Young; Lee, Young Hee] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Graphene Ctr, Dept Energy Sci, Phys Div BK21, Suwon 440746, South Korea; [Lee, Seung Mi] Korea Res Inst Stand & Sci, Ctr Nanocharacterizat, Taejon 305340, South Korea; [Park, Min Ho] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Sch Adv Mat Sci & Engn, Suwon 440746, South Korea; [Choi, Jae Young] Samsung Adv Inst Technol SAIT, Graphene Ctr, Suwon 440600, South Korea","Lee, YH (reprint author), Sungkyunkwan Univ, Sungkyunkwan Adv Inst Nanotechnol, Suwon 440746, South Korea.",leeyoung@skku.edu,"Lim, Seong Chu/A-6142-2013; Han, Gang Hee/P-7260-2014; Lee, Young Hee/A-5424-2013","Gunes, Fethullah/0000-0002-7553-3608; Duong, Dinh Loc/0000-0002-4118-9589",Star Faculty programme of the NRF of Korea [2010-0029653]; International Research and Development programme of the NRF of Korea [2011-00242]; WCU programme of the NRF of Korea [R31-2008-10029]; MEST,"This work was supported by the Star Faculty programme (2010-0029653), the International Research and Development programme (2011-00242) and the WCU programme (R31-2008-10029) of the NRF of Korea funded by MEST.",,30,165,165,17,417,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,11-Oct,2012,490,7419,,,,,235,+,,10.1038/nature11562,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,019IY,WOS:000309733300044,23034653.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,young hee,lee,female,1,1,vZXxTu0AAAAJ,54167

The two large earthquakes that struck the northeastern Indian Ocean on 11 April 2012 are an exception: they are the largest strike-slip events reported in historical times(1,2) and triggered large aftershocks worldwide(3). Yet they occurred within an intra-oceanic setting along the fossil fabric of the extinct Wharton basin, rather than on a discrete plate boundary(4-8). Here we show that the 11 April 2012 twin earthquakes are part of a continuing boost of the intraplate deformation between India and Australia that followed the Aceh 2004 and Nias 2005 megathrust earthquakes, subsequent to a stress transfer process recognized at other subduction zones(9,10). Using Coulomb stress change calculations, we show that the coseismic slips of the Aceh and Nias earthquakes can promote oceanic left-lateral strike-slip earthquakes on preexisting meridian-aligned fault planes. We further show that persistent viscous relaxation in the asthenospheric mantle several years after the Aceh megathrust explains the time lag between the 2004 megathrust and the 2012 intraplate events. On a short timescale, the 2012 events provide new evidence for the interplay between megathrusts at the subduction interface and intraplate deformation offshore. On a longer geological timescale, the Australian plate, driven by slab-pull forces at the Sunda trench, is detaching from the Indian plate, which is subjected to resisting forces at the Himalayan front(6,8,11).","[Delescluse, Matthias; Chamot-Rooke, Nicolas; Fleitout, Luce; Trubienko, Olga; Vigny, Christophe] Ecole Normale Super, Geol Lab, F-75005 Paris, France; [Delescluse, Matthias; Chamot-Rooke, Nicolas; Fleitout, Luce; Trubienko, Olga; Vigny, Christophe] CNRS, UMR8538, F-75005 Paris, France; [Cattin, Rodolphe] Univ Montpellier 2, F-34090 Montpellier, France; [Cattin, Rodolphe] CNRS, UMR5243, F-34090 Montpellier, France","Delescluse, M (reprint author), Ecole Normale Super, Geol Lab, F-75005 Paris, France.",delescluse@geologie.ens.fr,"Chamot-Rooke, Nicolas/A-6939-2008; Delescluse, Matthias/F-4678-2010","Chamot-Rooke, Nicolas/0000-0001-9924-749X; Delescluse, Matthias/0000-0002-8374-7358",,,,43,39,42,2,36,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-Oct,2012,490,7419,,,,,240,+,,10.1038/nature11520,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,019IY,WOS:000309733300045,23023134.0,No,,,11/20/17,christophe,vigny,male,0.99,629,na,na

On 11 April 2012, one of the largest strike-slip earthquakes ever recorded (seismic moment magnitude M-w 8.7) occurred about 100-200 kilometres southwest of the Sumatra subduction zone. Occurrence of great intraplate strike-slip faulting located seaward of a subduction zone is unusual. It results from northwest-southeast compression within the plate caused by the India-Eurasia continental collision to the northwest, together with northeast-southwest extension associated with slab pull stresses as the plate underthrusts Sumatra to the northeast. Here we use seismic wave analyses to reveal that the 11 April 2012 event had an extraordinarily complex four-fault rupture lasting about 160 seconds, and was followed approximately two hours later by a great (M-w 8.2) aftershock. The mainshock rupture initially expanded bilaterally with large slip (20-30 metres) on a right-lateral strike-slip fault trending west-northwest to east-southeast (WNW-ESE), and then bilateral rupture was triggered on an orthogonal left-lateral strike-slip fault trending north-northeast to south-southwest (NNE-SSW) that crosses the first fault. This was followed by westward rupture on a second WNW-ESE strike-slip fault offset about 150 kilometres towards the southwest from the first fault. Finally, rupture was triggered on another en echelon WNW-ESE fault about 330 kilometres west of the epicentre crossing the Ninetyeast ridge. The great aftershock, with an epicentre located 185 kilometres to the SSW of the mainshock epicentre, ruptured bilaterally on a NNE-SSW fault. The complex faulting limits our resolution of the slip distribution. These great ruptures on a lattice of strike-slip faults that extend through the crust and a further 30-40 kilometres into the upper mantle represent large lithospheric deformation that may eventually lead to a localized boundary between the Indian and Australian plates.","[Yue, Han; Lay, Thorne] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Koper, Keith D.] Univ Utah, Dept Geol & Geophys, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA","Lay, T (reprint author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",tlay@ucsc.edu,,,"NSF [EAR0635570, EAR0951558]","We thank H.

The 2012 east Indian Ocean earthquake that had a moment magnitude of 8.6 is the largest strike-slip event ever recorded. Here we show that the rate of occurrence of remote M >= 5.5 earthquakes (>1,500 kilometres from the epicentre) increased nearly fivefold for six days after the 2012 event, and extended in magnitude to M <= 7. These global aftershocks were located along the four lobes of Love-wave radiation; all struck where the dynamic shear strain is calculated to exceed 10(-7) for at least 100 seconds during dynamic-wave passage. The other M >= 8.5 main-shocks during the past decade are thrusts; after these events, the global rate of occurrence of remote M >= 5.5 events increased by about one-third the rate following the 2012 shock and lasted for only two days, a weaker but possibly real increase. We suggest that the unprecedented delayed triggering power of the 2012 earthquake may have arisen because of its strike-slip source geometry or because the event struck at a time of an unusually low global earthquake rate, perhaps increasing the number of nucleation sites that were very close to failure.","[Pollitz, Fred F.; Stein, Ross S.] US Geol Survey, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Sevilgen, Volkan] Seism Net, San Carlos, CA 94070 USA; [Buergmann, Roland] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Pollitz, FF (reprint author), US Geol Survey, 345 Middlefield Rd,MS 977, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA.",fpollitz@usgs.gov,,,,,,35,70,71,3,38,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-Oct,2012,490,7419,,,,,250,+,,10.1038/nature11504,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,019IY,WOS:000309733300047,23023131.0,No,,,11/20/17,roland,buergmann,male,1,255,zaKntLEAAAAJ,14644

Agricultural systems are already major forces of global environmental degradation(4,7), but population growth and increasing consumption of calorie- and meat-intensive diets are expected to roughly double human food demand by 2050 (ref. 3). Responding to these pressures, there is increasing focus on 'sustainable intensification' as a means to increase yields on underperforming landscapes while simultaneously decreasing the environmental impacts of agricultural systems(2-4,8-11). However, it is unclear what such efforts might entail for the future of global agricultural landscapes. Here we present a global-scale assessment of intensification prospects from closing 'yield gaps' (differences between observed yields and those attainable in a given region), the spatial patterns of agricultural management practices and yield limitation, and the management changes that may be necessary to achieve increased yields. We find that global yield variability is heavily controlled by fertilizer use, irrigation and climate. Large production increases (45% to 70% for most crops) are possible from closing yield gaps to 100% of attainable yields, and the changes to management practices that are needed to close yield gaps vary considerably by region and current intensity. Furthermore, we find that there are large opportunities to reduce the environmental impact of agriculture by eliminating nutrient overuse, while still allowing an approximately 30% increase in production of major cereals (maize, wheat and rice). Meeting the food security and sustainability challenges of the coming decades is possible, but will require considerable changes in nutrient and water management.","[Mueller, Nathaniel D.; Gerber, James S.; Johnston, Matt; Ray, Deepak K.; Foley, Jonathan A.] Univ Minnesota, Inst Environm IonE, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Ramankutty, Navin] McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada; [Ramankutty, Navin] McGill Univ, Global Environm & Climate Change Ctr, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada","Mueller, ND (reprint author), Univ Minnesota, Inst Environm IonE, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",muell512@umn.edu,"Ray, Deepak/F-7720-2012","Ramankutty, Navin/0000-0002-3737-5717","National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship; University of Minnesota College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences Fellowship; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada Discovery Grant; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation; University of Minnesota Institute on the Environment","We thank G.

Fossil arthropods rarely preserve neural tissue. As a result, inferring sensory and motor attributes of Cambrian taxa has been limited to interpreting external features, such as compound eyes(3) or sensilla decorating appendages(4), and early-diverging arthropods have scarcely been analysed in the context of nervous system evolution. Here we report exceptional preservation of the brain and optic lobes of a stem-group arthropod from 520 million years ago (Myr ago), Fuxianhuia protensa(5), exhibiting the most compelling neuroanatomy known from the Cambrian. The protocerebrum of Fuxianhuia is supplied by optic lobes evidencing traces of three nested optic centres serving forward-viewing eyes. Nerves from uniramous antennae define the deutocerebrum, and a stout pair of more caudal nerves indicates a contiguous tritocerebral component. Fuxianhuia shares a tripartite pre-stomodeal brain and nested optic neuropils with extant Malacostraca and Insecta(2,6), demonstrating that these characters were present in some of the earliest derived arthropods. The brain of Fuxianhuia impacts molecular analyses that advocate either a branchiopod-like ancestor of Hexapoda(7,8) or remipedes and possibly cephalocarids as sister groups of Hexapoda(9,10). Resolving arguments about whether the simple brain of a branchiopod approximates an ancestral insect brain or whether it is the result of secondary simplification has until now been hindered by lack of fossil evidence. The complex brain of Fuxianhuia accords with cladistic analyses on the basis of neural characters, suggesting that Branchiopoda derive from a malacostracan-like ancestor but underwent evolutionary reduction and character reversal of brain centres that are common to hexapods and malacostracans(2). The early origin of sophisticated brains provides a probable driver for versatile visual behaviours, a view that accords with compound eyes from the early Cambrian that were, in size and resolution, equal to those of modern insects and malacostracans(3).","[Ma, Xiaoya; Hou, Xianguang] Yunnan Univ, Yunnan Key Lab Palaeobiol, Kunming 650091, Peoples R China; [Ma, Xiaoya; Edgecombe, Gregory D.] Nat Hist Museum, Dept Earth Sci, London SW7 5BD, England; [Strausfeld, Nicholas J.] Univ Arizona, Dept Neurosci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Strausfeld, Nicholas J.] Univ Arizona, Ctr Insect Sci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","Ma, XY (reprint author), Yunnan Univ, Yunnan Key Lab Palaeobiol, Kunming 650091, Peoples R China.",x.ma@nhm.ac.uk,,"Edgecombe, Gregory/0000-0002-9591-8011","National Natural Science Foundation of China [40730211]; Leverhulme Trust [F/00 696/T]; Center for Insect Science, University of Arizona","This account is dedicated to J.

These neurons extend elaborate projections in the striatum, a large subcortical structure implicated in motor planning and reward-based learning. Phasic activation of dopaminergic neurons in response to salient or reward-predicting stimuli is thought to modulate striatal output through the release of dopamine to promote and reinforce motor action(1-4). Here we show that activation of dopamine neurons in striatal slices rapidly inhibits action potential firing in both direct-and indirect-pathway striatal projection neurons through vesicular release of the inhibitory transmitter GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid). GABA is released directly from dopaminergic axons but in a manner that is independent of the vesicular GABA transporter VGAT. Instead, GABA release requires activity of the vesicular monoamine transporter VMAT2, which is the vesicular transporter for dopamine. Furthermore, VMAT2 expression in GABAergic neurons lacking VGAT is sufficient to sustain GABA release. Thus, these findings expand the repertoire of synaptic mechanisms used by dopamine neurons to influence basal ganglia circuits, show a new substrate whose transport is dependent on VMAT2 and demonstrate that GABA can function as a bona fide co-transmitter in monoaminergic neurons.","[Tritsch, Nicolas X.; Ding, Jun B.; Sabatini, Bernardo L.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Sabatini, BL (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Neurobiol, 220 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",bsabatini@hms.harvard.edu,"Ding, Jun/B-2513-2009","Ding, Jun/0000-0003-0690-1312; Tritsch, Nicolas/0000-0003-3181-7681","Nancy Lurie Marks Family Foundation; National Institutes of Health [NS046579, 4R00NS075136]","The authors thank A.

Understanding genetic control of variability is important in evolutionary biology, agricultural selection programmes and human medicine, yet for complex traits, no individual genetic variants associated with variance, as opposed to the mean, have been identified. Here we perform a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of phenotypic variation using similar to 170,000 samples on height and body mass index (BMI) in human populations. We report evidence that the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs7202116 at the FTO gene locus, which is known to be associated with obesity (as measured by mean BMI for each rs7202116 genotype)(5-7), is also associated with phenotypic variability. We show that the results are not due to scale effects or other artefacts, and find no other experiment-wise significant evidence for effects on variability, either at loci other than FTO for BMI or at any locus for height. The difference in variance for BMI among individuals with opposite homozygous genotypes at the FTO locus is approximately 7%, corresponding to a difference of similar to 0.5 kilograms in the standard deviation of weight. Our results indicate that genetic variants can be discovered that are associated with variability, and that between-person variability in obesity can partly be explained by the genotype at the FTO locus. The results are consistent with reported FTO by environment interactions for BMI8, possibly mediated by DNA methylation(9,10).

With its small nervous system, Caenorhabditis elegans is a good model system(1,2) in which to understand how the dynamics of neural activity control this search behaviour. Extensive work on the nematode has identified the neurons that are necessary for the different locomotory behaviours underlying chemotaxis through the use of laser ablation(3-7), activity recording in immobilized animals and the study of mutants(4,5). However, we do not know the neural activity patterns in C. elegans that are sufficient to control its complex chemotactic behaviour. To understand how the activity in its interneurons coordinate different motor programs to lead the animal to food, here we used optogenetics and new optical tools to manipulate neural activity directly in freely moving animals to evoke chemotactic behaviour. By deducing the classes of activity patterns triggered during chemotaxis and exciting individual neurons with these patterns, we identified interneurons that control the essential locomotory programs for this behaviour. Notably, we discovered that controlling the dynamics of activity in just one interneuron pair (AIY) was sufficient to force the animal to locate, turn towards and track virtual light gradients. Two distinct activity patterns triggered in AIY as the animal moved through the gradient controlled reversals and gradual turns to drive chemotactic behaviour. Because AIY neurons are post-synaptic to most chemosensory and thermosensory neurons(8), it is probable that these activity patterns in AIY have an important role in controlling and coordinating different taxis behaviours of the animal.","[Kocabas, Askin; Shen, Ching-Han; Ramanathan, Sharad] Harvard Univ, FAS Ctr Syst Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kocabas, Askin; Shen, Ching-Han; Ramanathan, Sharad] Harvard Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Guo, Zengcai V.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA; [Ramanathan, Sharad] Allen Inst Brain Sci, Seattle, WA 98103 USA; [Ramanathan, Sharad] Harvard Univ, Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Ramanathan, Sharad] Harvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Kocabas, A (reprint author), Harvard Univ, FAS Ctr Syst Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",akocabas@cgr.harvard.edu; sharad@post.harvard.edu,,,"Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP) Postdoctoral Fellowship; National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Fellowship; NSF Career Award; Pew Scholar, Klingenstein Fellowship Award; National Institutes of Health (NIH) Pioneer Awards","We thank J.

Of all the forms of deafness, auditory neuropathy is of particular concern. This condition, defined primarily by damage to the SGNs with relative preservation of the hair cells(1), is responsible for a substantial proportion of patients with hearing impairment(2). Although the loss of hair cells can be circumvented partially by a cochlear implant, no routine treatment is available for sensory neuron loss, as poor innervation limits the prospective performance of an implant(3). Using stem cells to recover the damaged sensory circuitry is a potential therapeutic strategy. Here we present a protocol to induce differentiation from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) using signals involved in the initial specification of the otic placode. We obtained two types of otic progenitors able to differentiate in vitro into hair-cell-like cells and auditory neurons that display expected electrophysiological properties. Moreover, when transplanted into an auditory neuropathy model, otic neuroprogenitors engraft, differentiate and significantly improve auditory-evoked response thresholds. These results should stimulate further research into the development of a cell-based therapy for deafness.","[Chen, Wei; Jongkamonwiwat, Nopporn; Abbas, Leila; Eshtan, Sarah Jacob; Thurlow, Johanna K.; Andrews, Peter W.; Moore, Harry D.; Rivolta, Marcelo N.] Univ Sheffield, Ctr Stem Cell Biol, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Chen, Wei; Jongkamonwiwat, Nopporn; Abbas, Leila; Eshtan, Sarah Jacob; Johnson, Stuart L.; Kuhn, Stephanie; Milo, Marta; Thurlow, Johanna K.; Andrews, Peter W.; Marcotti, Walter; Moore, Harry D.; Rivolta, Marcelo N.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Biomed Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Jongkamonwiwat, Nopporn] Srinakharinwirot Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Ongkharak 26120, Nakhonnayok, Thailand","Rivolta, MN (reprint author), Univ Sheffield, Ctr Stem Cell Biol, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",m.n.rivolta@sheffield.ac.uk,,,Action on Hearing Loss (RNID); Deafness Research UK; Wellcome Trust [088719]; Medical Research Council; ESTOOLS; Wellcome Trust VIP award; RNID,"This work was supported primarily by grants from Action on Hearing Loss (RNID) to M.N.R.

The mechanisms by which this virus spreads among permissive target cells locally during the early stages of transmission and systemically during subsequent dissemination are not known(1). In vitro studies suggest that the formation of virological synapses during stable contacts between infected and uninfected T cells greatly increases the efficiency of viral transfer(2). It is unclear, however, whether T-cell contacts are sufficiently stable in vivo to allow for functional synapse formation under the conditions of perpetual cell motility in epithelial(3) and lymphoid tissues(4). Here, using multiphoton intravital microscopy, we examine the dynamic behaviour of HIV-infected T cells in the lymph nodes of humanized mice. We find that most productively infected T cells migrate robustly, resulting in their even distribution throughout the lymph node cortex. A subset of infected cells formed multinucleated syncytia through HIV envelope-dependent cell fusion. Both uncoordinated motility of syncytia and adhesion to CD4(+) lymph node cells led to the formation of long membrane tethers, increasing cell lengths to up to ten times that of migrating uninfected T cells. Blocking the egress of migratory T cells from the lymph nodes into efferent lymph vessels, and thus interrupting T-cell recirculation, limited HIV dissemination and strongly reduced plasma viraemia. Thus, we have found that HIV-infected T cells are motile, form syncytia and establish tethering interactions that may facilitate cell-to-cell transmission through virological synapses. Migration of T cells in lymph nodes therefore spreads infection locally, whereas their recirculation through tissues is important for efficient systemic viral spread, suggesting new molecular targets to antagonize HIV infection.","[Murooka, Thomas T.; Deruaz, Maud; Marangoni, Francesco; Vrbanac, Vladimir D.; Seung, Edward; Tager, Andrew M.; Luster, Andrew D.; Mempel, Thorsten R.] Harvard Univ, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Sch Med, Ctr Immunol & Inflammatory Dis, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [von Andrian, Ulrich H.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Immune Dis Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [von Andrian, Ulrich H.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Mempel, TR (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Sch Med, Ctr Immunol & Inflammatory Dis, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",tmempel@mgh.harvard.edu,"von Andrian, Ulrich/A-5775-2008; Marangoni, Francesco/I-9087-2012","Marangoni, Francesco/0000-0002-2490-849X","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [P01 AI0178897, R56 AI097052, R01 CA150975, P30 AI060354]; Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Harvard; MGH ECOR Tosteson Postdoctoral Fellowship Award; NIH [T32 AI007387]","We thank J.

Caspase-1 activation leads to the maturation and release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1 beta and IL-18, as well as lytic inflammatory cell death known as pyroptosis(2). Recently, a new non-canonical inflammasome was described that activates caspase-11, a pro-inflammatory caspase required for lipopolysaccharide-induced lethality(3). This study also highlighted that previously generated caspase-1 knockout mice lack a functional allele of Casp11 (also known as Casp4), making them functionally Casp1 Casp11 double knockouts(3-6). Previous studies have shown that these mice are more susceptible to infections with microbial pathogens(1), including the bacterial pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. typhimurium)(7,8), but the individual contributions of caspase-1 and caspase-11 to this phenotype are not known. Here we show that non-canonical caspase-11 activation contributes to macrophage death during S. typhimurium infection. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-dependent and TIR-domaincontaining adaptor-inducing interferon-beta (TRIF)-dependent interferon-beta production is crucial for caspase-11 activation in macrophages, but is only partially required for pro-caspase-11 expression, consistent with the existence of an interferon-inducible activator of caspase-11. Furthermore, Casp1(-/-) mice were significantly more susceptible to infection with S. typhimurium than mice lacking both pro-inflammatory caspases (Casp1(-/-) Casp11(-/-)). This phenotype was accompanied by higher bacterial counts, the formation of extracellular bacterial microcolonies in the infected tissue and a defect in neutrophil-mediated clearance. These results indicate that caspase-11-dependent cell death is detrimental to the host in the absence of caspase-1-mediated innate immunity, resulting in extracellular replication of a facultative intracellular bacterial pathogen.","[Broz, Petr; Ruby, Thomas; Belhocine, Kamila; Monack, Denise M.] Stanford Univ, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Stanford Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Bouley, Donna M.] Stanford Univ, Dept Comparat Med, Stanford Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kayagaki, Nobuhiko; Dixit, Vishva M.] Genentech Inc, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA","Monack, DM (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Stanford Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",dmonack@stanford.edu,,"Broz, Petr/0000-0002-2334-7790","National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [AI095396, AI08972]; Stanford Digestive Disease Center (DDC) pilot grant; Human Frontiers in Science Program (HFSP) [LT000636/2009-L]","We thank J.

Here we report the sequencing and assembly of the oyster genome using short reads and a fosmid-pooling strategy, along with transcriptomes of development and stress response and the proteome of the shell. The oyster genome is highly polymorphic and rich in repetitive sequences, with some transposable elements still actively shaping variation. Transcriptome studies reveal an extensive set of genes responding to environmental stress. The expansion of genes coding for heat shock protein 70 and inhibitors of apoptosis is probably central to the oyster's adaptation to sessile life in the highly stressful intertidal zone. Our analyses also show that shell formation in molluscs is more complex than currently understood and involves extensive participation of cells and their exosomes.

To carry out analysis on gut microbial content in patients with type 2 diabetes, we developed a protocol for a metagenome-wide association study (MGWAS) and undertook a two-stage MGWAS based on deep shotgun sequencing of the gut microbial DNA from 345 Chinese individuals. We identified and validated approximately 60,000 type-2-diabetes-associated markers and established the concept of a metagenomic linkage group, enabling taxonomic species-level analyses. MGWAS analysis showed that patients with type 2 diabetes were characterized by a moderate degree of gut microbial dysbiosis, a decrease in the abundance of some universal butyrate-producing bacteria and an increase in various opportunistic pathogens, as well as an enrichment of other microbial functions conferring sulphate reduction and oxidative stress resistance. An analysis of 23 additional individuals demonstrated that these gut microbial markers might be useful for classifying type 2 diabetes.","[Qin, Junjie; Li, Yingrui; Li, Shenghui; Zhu, Jianfeng; Liang, Suisha; Zhang, Wenwei; Guan, Yuanlin; Shen, Dongqian; Peng, Yangqing; Zhang, Dongya; Jie, Zhuye; Wu, Wenxian; Qin, Youwen; Xue, Wenbin; Li, Junhua; Chen, Weineng; Xu, Ran; Wang, Mingbang; Feng, Qiang; Gong, Meihua; Yu, Jing; Zhang, Yanyan; Zhang, Ming; Zhang, Zhaoxi; Chen, Hua; Yang, Ruifu; Zheng, Weimou; Li, Songgang; Yang, Huanming; Wang, Jian; Kristiansen, Karsten; Wang, Jun] BGI Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, Peoples R China; [Cai, Zhiming; Li, Zesong; Tang, Aifa; Zhong, Shilong] Shenzhen Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Shenzhen Peoples Hosp 2, Shenzhen 518035, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Fan; Han, Lingchuan; Lu, Donghui; Wu, Peixian; Dai, Yali; Sun, Xiaojuan] Peking Univ, Shenzhen Hosp, Shenzhen 518036, Peoples R China; [Li, Xiaoping] Guangdong Acad Med Sci, Guangdong Gen Hosp, Med Res Ctr, Guangzhou 510080, Peoples R China; [Hansen, Torben; Pedersen, Oluf; Wang, Jun] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Hlth Sci, Novo Nordisk Fdn Ctr Basic Metab Res, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Sanchez, Gaston; Nielsen, Rasmus] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94820 USA; [Sanchez, Gaston; Nielsen, Rasmus] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Stat, Berkeley, CA 94820 USA; [Raes, Jeroen; Falony, Gwen; Okuda, Shujiro] VIB, Dept Biol Struct, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Raes, Jeroen; Falony, Gwen; Okuda, Shujiro] Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Appl Biol Sci DBIT, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Almeida, Mathieu; LeChatelier, Emmanuelle; Renault, Pierre; Pons, Nicolas; Batto, Jean-Michel; Ehrlich, S.

Our ability to integrate information across platforms provided key insights into previously defined gene expression subtypes and demonstrated the existence of four main breast cancer classes when combining data from five platforms, each of which shows significant molecular heterogeneity. Somatic mutations in only three genes (TP53, PIK3CA and GATA3) occurred at >10% incidence across all breast cancers; however, there were numerous subtype-associated and novel gene mutations including the enrichment of specific mutations in GATA3, PIK3CA and MAP3K1 with the luminal A subtype. We identified two novel protein-expression-defined subgroups, possibly produced by stromal/microenvironmental elements, and integrated analyses identified specific signalling pathways dominant in each molecular subtype including a HER2/phosphorylated HER2/EGFR/phosphorylated EGFR signature within the HER2-enriched expression subtype. Comparison of basal-like breast tumours with high-grade serous ovarian tumours showed many molecular commonalities, indicating a related aetiology and similar therapeutic opportunities. The biological finding of the four main breast cancer subtypes caused by different subsets of genetic and epigenetic abnormalities raises the hypothesis that much of the clinically observable plasticity and heterogeneity occurs within, and not across, these major biological subtypes of breast cancer.","[Hoadley, Katherine A.; He, Xiaping; Chao, Hann-Hsiang; Prat, Aleix; Silva, Grace O.; Iglesia, Michael D.; Zhao, Wei; Berg, Jonathan S.; Adams, Michael; Weisenberger, Daniel J.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Genet, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Koboldt, Daniel C.; Fulton, Robert S.; McLellan, Michael D.; Schmidt, Heather; Kalicki-Veizer, Joelle; McMichael, Joshua F.; Fulton, Lucinda L.; Dooling, David J.; Ding, Li; Mardis, Elaine R.; Wilson, Richard K.] Washington Univ, Genome Inst, St Louis, MO 63108 USA; [Ding, Li; Mardis, Elaine R.; Wilson, Richard K.] Washington Univ, Dept Genet, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Mardis, Elaine R.; Wilson, Richard K.; Ellis, Matthew J.; Bose, Ron] Washington Univ, Siteman Canc Ctr, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Ally, Adrian; Balasundaram, Miruna; Butterfield, Yaron S.

Some observational support for this idea is provided by the lack of X-ray-emitting binary stars comprising one black hole and one other star ('black-hole/X-ray binaries') in Milky Way globular clusters, even though many neutron-star/X-ray binaries are known(4). Although a few black holes have been seen in globular clusters around other galaxies(5,6), the masses of these cannot be determined, and some may be intermediate-mass black holes that form through exotic mechanisms(7). Here we report the presence of two flat-spectrum radio sources in the Milky Way globular cluster M22, and we argue that these objects are black holes of stellar mass (each similar to 10-20 times more massive than the Sun) that are accreting matter. We find a high ratio of radio-to-X-ray flux for these black holes, consistent with the larger predicted masses of black holes in globular clusters compared to those outside(8). The identification of two black holes in one cluster shows that ejection of black holes is not as efficient as predicted by most models(1,2,4), and we argue that M22 may contain a total population of similar to 5-100 black holes. The large core radius of M22 could arise from heating produced by the black holes(9).","[Strader, Jay; Chomiuk, Laura] Michigan State Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Strader, Jay; Chomiuk, Laura] Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Chomiuk, Laura] Natl Radio Astron Observ, Socorro, NM 87801 USA; [Maccarone, Thomas J.] Univ Southampton, Sch Phys & Astron, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Miller-Jones, James C.

Collisions between such bodies produce small dust particles(2), the spectral features of which reveal their composition and, hence, that of their parent bodies. A measurement of the composition of olivine crystals (Mg2-2xFe2xSiO4) has been done for the protoplanetary disk HD 100546 (refs 3, 4) and for olivine crystals in the warm inner parts of planetary systems. The latter compares well with the iron-rich olivine in asteroids(5,6) (x approximate to 0.29). In the cold outskirts of the beta Pictoris system, an analogue to the young Solar System, olivine crystals were detected(7) but their composition remained undetermined, leaving unknown how the composition of the bulk of Solar System cometary olivine grains compares with that of extrasolar comets(8,9). Here we report the detection of the 69-micrometre-wavelength band of olivine crystals in the spectrum of beta Pictoris. Because the disk is optically thin, we can associate the crystals with an extrasolar proto-Kuiper belt a distance of 15-45 astronomical units from the star (one astronomical unit is the Sun-Earth distance), determine their magnesium-rich composition (x = 0.01 +/- 0.001) and show that they make up 3.6 +/- 1.0 per cent of the total dust mass. These values are strikingly similar to those for the dust emitted by the most primitive comets in the Solar System(8-10), even though beta Pictoris is more massive and more luminous and has a different planetary system architecture.","[de Vries, B.

The timescale of this 'instantaneous' process can be stretched using weak measurements(1,2), such that it takes the form of a gradual random walk towards a final state. Remarkably, the interim measurement record is sufficient to continuously track and steer the quantum state using feedback(3-8). Here we implement quantum feedback control in a solid-state system, namely a superconducting quantum bit (qubit) coupled to a microwave cavity(9). A weak measurement of the qubit is implemented by probing the cavity with microwave photons, maintaining its average occupation at less than one photon. These photons are then directed to a high-bandwidth, quantum-noise-limited amplifier(10,11), which allows real-time monitoring of the state of the cavity (and, hence, that of the qubit) with high fidelity. We demonstrate quantum feedback control by inhibiting the decay of Rabi oscillations, allowing them to persist indefinitely(12). Such an ability permits the active suppression of decoherence and enables a method of quantum error correction based on weak continuous measurements(13,14). Other applications include quantum state stabilization(4,7,15), entanglement generation using measurement(16), state purification(17) and adaptive measurements(18,19).","[Vijay, R.; Macklin, C.; Slichter, D.

Evidence for such a coupling may lie in the sulphate record from polar ice cores, but previous analyses of melted ice-core samples have provided only sulphate ion concentrations, which may be due to sulphuric acid(3). Here we present profiles of sulphate salt and sulphate-adhered dust fluxes over the past 300,000 years from the Dome Fuji ice core in inland Antarctica. Our results show a nearly constant flux of sulphate-adhered dust through glacial and interglacial periods despite the large increases in total dust flux during glacial maxima(4). The sulphate salt flux, however, correlates inversely with temperature, suggesting a climatic coupling between particulate sulphur and temperature. For example, the total sulphate salt flux during the Last Glacial Maximum averages 5.78 mg m(-2) yr(-1), which is almost twice the Holocene value. Although it is based on a modern analogue with considerable uncertainties when applied to the ice-core record, this analysis indicates that the glacial-to-interglacial decrease in sulphate would lessen the aerosol indirect effects on cloud lifetime and albedo, leading to an Antarctic warming of 0.1 to 5 kelvin.","[Iizuka, Yoshinori; Hondoh, Takeo] Hokkaido Univ, Inst Low Temp Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600819, Japan; [Uemura, Ryu] Univ Ryukyus, Fac Sci, Dept Chem Biol & Marine Sci, Okinawa 9030213, Japan; [Motoyama, Hideaki; Miyake, Takayuki; Hirabayashi, Motohiro] Natl Inst Polar Res, Tokyo 1908518, Japan; [Suzuki, Toshitaka] Yamagata Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Fac Sci, Yamagata 9908560, Japan","Iizuka, Y (reprint author), Hokkaido Univ, Inst Low Temp Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600819, Japan.",iizuka@lowtem.hokudai.ac.jp,"HONDOH, TAKEO/E-7551-2011; Iizuka, Yoshinori/D-9112-2012","HONDOH, TAKEO/0000-0003-4129-022X; Uemura, Ryu/0000-0002-4236-0085","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology(MEXT) [14GS0202, 23680001, 21221002]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS); Institute of Low Temperature Science, Hokkaido University","We thank all members of the JARE and the Ice Core Consortium for work at Dome Fuji; T.

Atmospheric methane concentrations have varied on a number of time scales in the past, but what has caused these variations is not always well understood(1-8). The different sources and sinks of methane have specific isotopic signatures, and the isotopic composition of methane can therefore help to identify the environmental drivers of variations in atmospheric methane concentrations(9). Here we present high-resolution carbon isotope data (delta C-13 content) for methane from two ice cores from Greenland for the past two millennia. We find that the delta C-13 content underwent pronounced centennial-scale variations between 100 BC and AD 1600. With the help of two-box model calculations, we show that the centennial-scale variations in isotope ratios can be attributed to changes in pyrogenic and biogenic sources. We find correlations between these source changes and both natural climate variability-such as the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age-and changes in human population and land use, such as the decline of the Roman empire and the Han dynasty, and the population expansion during the medieval period.","[Sapart, C.

A main characteristic of the reversing field is a large decrease in the axial dipole and the dominant role of non-dipole components(1-3). Other features strongly depend on whether they are derived from sedimentary or volcanic records. Only thermal remanent magnetization of lava flows can capture faithful records of a rapidly varying non-dipole field, but, because of episodic volcanic activity, sequences of overlying flows yield incomplete records. Here we show that the ten most detailed volcanic records of reversals can be matched in a very satisfactory way, under the assumption of a common duration, revealing common dynamical characteristics. We infer that the reversal process has remained unchanged, with the same time constants and durations, at least since 180 million years ago. We propose that the reversing field is characterized by three successive phases: a precursory event, a 1806 polarity switch and a rebound. The first and third phases reflect the emergence of the non-dipole field with large-amplitude secular variation. They are rarely both recorded at the same site owing to the rapidly changing field geometry and last for less than 2,500 years. The actual transit between the two polarities does not last longer than 1,000 years and might therefore result from mechanisms other than those governing normal secular variation. Such changes are too brief to be accurately recorded by most sediments.","[Valet, Jean-Pierre; Fournier, Alexandre; Courtillot, Vincent] Univ Paris Diderot, CNRS, UMR 7154, Inst Phys Globe Paris, F-75238 Paris 05, France; [Herrero-Bervera, Emilio] Univ Hawaii Manoa, SOEST Hawaii Inst Geophys & Planetol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA","Valet, JP (reprint author), Univ Paris Diderot, CNRS, UMR 7154, Inst Phys Globe Paris, 1 Rue Jussieu, F-75238 Paris 05, France.",valet@ipgp.fr,"Fournier, Alexandre/A-5774-2011; Valet, Jean-Pierre/A-6332-2011","Fournier, Alexandre/0000-0003-3276-0496; ",,,,38,38,38,0,43,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-Oct,2012,490,7418,,,,,89,+,,10.1038/nature11491,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,015LG,WOS:000309446800038,23038471.0,No,,,11/20/17,emilio,herrero-bervera,male,0.99,370,na,na

In particular, the position of the shell-less vermiform Aplacophora and its relationship to the better-known Polyplacophora (chitons) have been problematic: Aplacophora has been treated as a paraphyletic or monophyletic group at the base of the Mollusca(3,6,8), proximate to other derived clades such as Cephalopoda(2,3,10), or as sister group to the Polyplacophora, forming the clade Aculifera(1,5,7,11,12). Resolution of this debate is required to allow the evolutionary origins of Mollusca to be reconstructed with confidence. Recent fossil finds(13-16) support the Aculifera hypothesis, demonstrating that the Palaeozoic-era palaeoloricate 'chitons' included taxa combining certain polyplacophoran and aplacophoran characteristics(5). However, fossils combining an unambiguously aplacophoran-like body with chiton-like valves have remained elusive. Here we describe such a fossil, Kulindroplax perissokomos gen. et sp. nov., from the Herefordshire Lagerstatte(17,18) (about 425 million years BP), a Silurian deposit preserving a marine biota(18) in unusual three-dimensional detail. The specimen is reconstructed three-dimensionally through physical-optical tomography(19). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that this and many other palaeoloricate chitons are crown-group aplacophorans.","[Sutton, Mark D.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Earth Sci & Engn, London SW7 2BP, England; [Briggs, Derek E.

Comparative anatomy of vertebrate development-based on the Meckel-Serres law(2) and von Baer's laws of embryology(3) from the early nineteenth century-shows that embryos from various taxa appear different in early stages, converge to a similar form during mid-embryogenesis, and again diverge in later stages. This morphogenetic series is known as the embryonic 'hourglass'(4,5), and its bottleneck of high conservation in mid-embryogenesis is referred to as the phylotypic stage(6). Recent analyses in zebrafish and Drosophila embryos provided convincing molecular support for the hourglass model, because during the phylotypic stage the transcriptome was dominated by ancient genes(7) and global gene expression profiles were reported to be most conserved(8). Although extensively explored in animals, an embryonic hourglass has not been reported in plants, which represent the second major kingdom in the tree of life that evolved embryogenesis. Here we provide phylotranscriptomic evidence for a molecular embryonic hourglass in Arabidopsis thaliana, using two complementary approaches. This is particularly significant because the possible absence of an hourglass based on morphological features in plants suggests that morphological and molecular patterns might be uncoupled. Together with the reported developmental hourglass patterns in animals, these findings indicate convergent evolution of the molecular hourglass and a conserved logic of embryogenesis across kingdoms.","[Quint, Marcel; Ullrich, Kristian Karsten] Leibniz Inst Plant Biochem, Independent Jr Res Grp, Dept Mol Signal Proc, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Drost, Hajk-Georg; Gabel, Alexander; Boenn, Markus; Grosse, Ivo] Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Comp Sci, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Boenn, Markus] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Soil Ecol, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany","Quint, M (reprint author), Leibniz Inst Plant Biochem, Independent Jr Res Grp, Dept Mol Signal Proc, Weinberg 3, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany.",mquint@ipb-halle.de,"quint, marcel/J-8483-2012; Drost, Hajk-Georg/G-2632-2015","Drost, Hajk-Georg/0000-0002-1567-306X; Quint, Marcel/0000-0003-2935-4083; Ullrich, Kristian/0000-0003-4308-9626","'Exzellenznetzwerk fur Biowissenschaften' of the Federal State of Sachsen-Anhalt, Germany","We are grateful to S.

This requires the sustained expansion of immune-suppressive maternal FOXP3(+) regulatory T cells (T-reg cells), because even transient partial ablation triggers fetal-specific effector T-cell activation and pregnancy loss(1,2). In turn, many idiopathic pregnancy complications proposed to originate from disrupted fetal tolerance are associated with blunted maternal T-reg expansion(3-5). Importantly, however, the antigen specificity and cellular origin of maternal Treg cells that accumulate during gestation remain incompletely defined. Here we show that pregnancy selectively stimulates the accumulation of maternal FOXP3(+) CD4 cells with fetal specificity using tetramer-based enrichment that allows the identification of rare endogenous T cells(6). Interestingly, after delivery, fetal-specific T-reg cells persist at elevated levels, maintain tolerance to pre-existing fetal antigen, and rapidly re-accumulate during subsequent pregnancy. The accelerated expansion of T-reg cells during secondary pregnancy was driven almost exclusively by proliferation of fetal-specific FOXP3(+) cells retained from prior pregnancy, whereas induced FOXP3 expression and proliferation of pre-existing FOXP3(+) cells each contribute to T-reg expansion during primary pregnancy. Furthermore, fetal resorption in secondary compared with primary pregnancy becomes more resilient to partial maternal FOXP3(+) cell ablation. Thus, pregnancy imprints FOXP3(+) CD4 cells that sustain protective regulatory memory to fetal antigen. We anticipate that these findings will spark further investigation on maternal regulatory T-cell specificity that unlocks new strategies for improving pregnancy outcomes and novel approaches for therapeutically exploiting T-reg cell memory.","[Rowe, Jared H.; Ertelt, James M.; Xin, Lijun; Way, Sing Sing] Univ Minnesota, Sch Med, Ctr Infect Dis & Microbiol Translat Res, Ctr Immunol,Dept Pediat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Rowe, Jared H.; Ertelt, James M.; Xin, Lijun; Way, Sing Sing] Univ Minnesota, Sch Med, Ctr Infect Dis & Microbiol Translat Res, Ctr Immunol,Dept Microbiol, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Way, SS (reprint author), Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Infect Dis, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA.",singsing.way@cchmc.org,,"Way, Sing Sing/0000-0001-8948-1952","NIH-NIAID [R01AI087830, R01AI100934]; NIH-NIDDK [F30DK084674]; Burroughs Wellcome Fund","We thank M.

Inflammasomes activate the caspase-1 (CASP1) protease, which processes the cytokines interleukin (IL)-1 beta and IL-18, and initiates a lytic host cell death called pyroptosis(1). To identify novel CASP1 functions in vivo, we devised a strategy for cytosolic delivery of bacterial flagellin, a specific ligand for the NAIP5 (NLR family, apoptosis inhibitory protein 5)/NLRC4 (NLR family, CARD-domain-containing 4) inflammasome(2-4). Here we show that systemic inflammasome activation by flagellin leads to a loss of vascular fluid into the intestine and peritoneal cavity, resulting in rapid (less than 30 min) death in mice. This unexpected response depends on the inflammasome components NAIP5, NLRC4 and CASP1, but is independent of the production of IL-1 beta or IL-18. Instead, inflammasome activation results, within minutes, in an 'eicosanoid storm'-a pathological release of signalling lipids, including prostaglandins and leukotrienes, that rapidly initiate inflammation and vascular fluid loss. Mice deficient in cyclooxygenase-1, a critical enzyme in prostaglandin biosynthesis, are resistant to these rapid pathological effects of systemic inflammasome activation by either flagellin or anthrax lethal toxin. Inflammasome-dependent biosynthesis of eicosanoids is mediated by the activation of cytosolic phospholipase A(2) in resident peritoneal macrophages, which are specifically primed for the production of eicosanoids by high expression of eicosanoid biosynthetic enzymes. Our results therefore identify eicosanoids as a previously unrecognized cell-type-specific signalling output of the inflammasome with marked physiological consequences in vivo.","[von Moltke, Jakob; Trinidad, Norver J.; Vance, Russell E.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Div Immunol & Pathogenesis, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kintzer, Alexander F.; Krantz, Bryan A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Wang, Samantha B.; Gronert, Karsten] Univ Calif Berkeley, Vis Sci Program, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Moayeri, Mahtab; Leppla, Stephen H.] NIAID, Parasit Dis Lab, Microbial Pathogenesis Sect, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [van Rooijen, Nico] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Med, Dept Mol Cell Biol, NL-1081 BT Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Brown, Charles R.] Univ Missouri, Dept Vet Pathobiol, Columbia, MO 65211 USA","Vance, RE (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Div Immunol & Pathogenesis, 229 Stanley Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",kgronert@berkeley.edu; rvance@berkeley.edu,,"Kintzer, Alexander/0000-0001-9630-7258; Krantz, Bryan/0000-0002-4911-5824","Burroughs Wellcome Fund; Cancer Research Institute; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [AI075039, AI080749, AI063302, EY016136, EY022208]; Cancer Research Coordinating Committee of the University of California","We thank S.

We previously characterized a homology-dependent silencing mechanism referred to as the trans-silencing effect (TSE), involved in P-transposable-element repression in the germ line(3-5). We now show that clusters of P-element-derived transgenes that induce strong TSE6,7 can convert other homologous transgene clusters incapable of TSE into strong silencers, which transmit the acquired silencing capacity through 50 generations. The paramutation occurs without any need for chromosome pairing between the paramutagenic and the paramutated loci, and is mediated by maternal inheritance of cytoplasm carrying Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) homologous to the transgenes. The repression capacity of the paramutated locus is abolished by a loss-of-function mutation of the aubergine gene involved in piRNA biogenesis, but not by a loss-of-function mutation of the Dicer-2 gene involved in siRNA production. The paramutated cluster, previously producing barely detectable levels of piRNAs, is converted into a stable, strong piRNA-producing locus by the paramutation and becomes fully paramutagenic itself. Our work provides a genetic model for the emergence of piRNA loci, as well as for RNA-mediated trans-generational repression of transposable elements.","[de Vanssay, Augustin; Boivin, Antoine; Hermant, Catherine; Teysset, Laure; Delmarre, Valerie; Ronsseray, Stephane] Univ Paris 06, CNRS, UMR7622, Dev Biol Lab, F-75005 Paris, France; [Bouge, Anne-Laure; Antoniewski, Christophe] Inst Pasteur, CNRS, URA2578, F-75015 Paris, France","Ronsseray, S (reprint author), Univ Paris 06, CNRS, UMR7622, Dev Biol Lab, 9 Quai St Bernard, F-75005 Paris, France.",christophe.antoniewski@upmc.fr; stephane.ronsseray@upmc.fr,"Antoniewski, Christophe/G-4519-2011","Antoniewski, Christophe/0000-0001-7709-2116; Boivin, Antoine/0000-0001-8671-1599; Teysset, Laure/0000-0002-7413-1850","Ministere de l'Enseignement Superieur et de la Recherche; Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale; Association Nationale de la Recherche (ANR); Association pour la Recherche contre le Cancer; ANR (project ""Nuclear endosiRNAs"")","We thank O.

The normal germinal centre B cell is the presumed cell of origin for both BL and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), yet gene expression analysis suggests that these malignancies may use different oncogenic pathways(2). BL is subdivided into a sporadic subtype that is diagnosed in developed countries, the Epstein-Barr-virus-associated endemic subtype, and an HIV-associated subtype, but it is unclear whether these subtypes use similar or divergent oncogenic mechanisms. Here we used high-throughput RNA sequencing and RNA interference screening to discover essential regulatory pathways in BL that cooperate with MYC, the defining oncogene of this cancer. In 70% of sporadic BL cases, mutations affecting the transcription factor TCF3 (E2A) or its negative regulator ID3 fostered TCF3 dependency. TCF3 activated the pro-survival phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase pathway in BL, in part by augmenting tonic B-cell receptor signalling. In 38% of sporadic BL cases, oncogenic CCND3 mutations produced highly stable cyclin D3 isoforms that drive cell cycle progression.

They contain a conserved 'helicase core' of two RecA-like domains (domains (D)1 and D2), which uses ATP to catalyse the unwinding of short RNA duplexes by non-processive, local strand separation(3). This mode of action differs from that of translocating helicases and allows DEAD-box proteins to remodel large RNAs and RNA-protein complexes without globally disrupting RNA structure(4). However, the structural basis for this distinctive mode of RNA unwinding remains unclear. Here, structural, biochemical and genetic analyses of the yeast DEAD-box protein Mss116p indicate that the helicase core domains have modular functions that enable a novel mechanism for RNA-duplex recognition and unwinding. By investigating D1 and D2 individually and together, we find that D1 acts as an ATP-binding domain and D2 functions as an RNA-duplex recognition domain. D2 contains a nucleic-acid-binding pocket that is formed by conserved DEAD-box protein sequence motifs and accommodates A-form but not B-form duplexes, providing a basis for RNA substrate specificity. Upon a conformational change in which the two core domains join to form a 'closed state' with an ATPase active site, conserved motifs in D1 promote the unwinding of duplex substrates bound to D2 by excluding one RNA strand and bending the other. Our results provide a comprehensive structural model for how DEAD-box proteins recognize and unwind RNA duplexes. This model explains key features of DEAD-box protein function and affords a new perspective on how the evolutionarily related cores of other RNA and DNA helicases diverged to use different mechanisms.","[Mallam, Anna L.; Del Campo, Mark; Gilman, Benjamin; Sidote, David J.; Lambowitz, Alan M.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Chem & Biochem, Inst Cellular & Mol Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Mallam, Anna L.; Del Campo, Mark; Gilman, Benjamin; Sidote, David J.; Lambowitz, Alan M.] Univ Texas Austin, Sch Biol Sci, Sect Mol Genet & Microbiol, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Lambowitz, AM (reprint author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Chem & Biochem, Inst Cellular & Mol Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",lambowitz@austin.utexas.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of General Medical Sciences; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; EMBO [ALTF 389-2010]; NIH [GM037951]","We thank A.

BetP adjusts its transport activity by sensing the cytoplasmic K+ concentration as a measure for hyperosmotic stress via the osmosensing carboxy-terminal domain(2,3). BetP needs to be in a trimeric state for communication between individual protomers through several intratrimeric interaction sites(4). Recently, crystal structures of inward-facing BetP trimers have contributed to our understanding of activity regulation on a molecular level(5,6). Here we report new crystal structures, which reveal two conformationally asymmetric BetP trimers(7), capturing among them three distinct transport states. We observe a total of four new conformations at once: an outward-open apo and an outward-occluded apo state, and two closed transition states-one in complex with betaine and one substrate-free. On the basis of these new structures, we identified local and global conformational changes in BetP that underlie the molecular transport mechanism, which partially resemble structural changes observed in other sodium-coupled LeuT-like fold transporters, but show differences we attribute to the osmolytic nature of betaine, the exclusive substrate specificity and the regulatory properties of BetP.","[Perez, Camilo; Koshy, Caroline; Yildiz, Oezkan; Ziegler, Christine] Max Planck Inst Biophys, Dept Biol Struct, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany; [Ziegler, Christine] Univ Regensburg, Inst Biophys & Biophys Chem, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany","Ziegler, C (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Biophys, Dept Biol Struct, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany.",christine.ziegler@biophys.mpg.de,,"Yildiz, Ozkan/0000-0003-3659-2805; Perez, Camilo/0000-0002-5800-0084","International Max-Planck Research School; DFG (German Research Foundation), Collaborative Research Center 807 ""Transport and Communication across Biological Membranes""","We thank L.

Among animals, however, these reports have been heavily biased towards avian phenologies, whereas we still know comparatively little about other seasonal adaptations, such as mammalian hibernation. Here we show a significant delay (0.47 days per year, over a 20-year period) in the hibernation emergence date of adult females in a wild population of Columbian ground squirrels in Alberta, Canada. This finding was related to the climatic conditions at our study location: owing to within-individual phenotypic plasticity, females emerged later during years of lower spring temperature and delayed snowmelt. Although there has not been a significant annual trend in spring temperature, the date of snowmelt has become progressively later owing to an increasing prevalence of late-season snowstorms. Importantly, years of later emergence were also associated with decreased individual fitness. There has consequently been a decline in mean fitness (that is, population growth rate) across the past two decades. Our results show that plastic responses to climate change may be driven by climatic trends other than increasing temperature, and may be associated with declines in individual fitness and, hence, population viability.","[Lane, Jeffrey E.; Kruuk, Loeske E.

Laser ablation profiles of strontium/calcium, barium/calcium and strontium isotope ratios in tooth enamel are a means to decipher intra-individual diet and habitat changes. Here we show that the home range area was of similar size for species of the three hominin genera but that the dietary breadth was much higher in Australopithecus africanus than in Paranthropus robustus and early Homo. We also confirm that P. robustus relied more on plant-based foodstuffs than early Homo. A South African scenario is emerging in which the broad ecological niche of Australopithecus became split, and was then occupied by Paranthropus and early Homo, both consuming a lower diversity of foods than Australopithecus.","[Balter, Vincent; Telouk, Philippe] Ecole Normale Super Lyon, CNRS, UMR 5276, Lab Geol Lyon, F-69342 Lyon 07, France; [Braga, Jose] Univ Toulouse Paul Sabatier, CNRS, UMR 5288, Comp Assisted Palaeoanthropol Team, F-31000 Toulouse, France; [Thackeray, J.

After autotomy, the missing part is either replaced through regeneration (for example, in urodeles, lizards, arthropods and crustaceans) or permanently lost (such as in mammals). Although most autotomy involves the loss of appendages (legs, chelipeds, antennae or tails, for example), skin autotomy can occur in certain taxa of scincid and gekkonid lizards(3). Here we report the first demonstration of skin autotomy in Mammalia (African spiny mice, Acomys). Mechanical testing showed a propensity for skin to tear under very low tension and the absence of a fracture plane. After skin loss, rapid wound contraction was followed by hair follicle regeneration in dorsal skin wounds. Notably, we found that regenerative capacity in Acomys was extended to ear holes, where the mice exhibited complete regeneration of hair follicles, sebaceous glands, dermis and cartilage. Salamanders capable of limb regeneration form a blastema (a mass of lineage-restricted progenitor cells(4)) after limb loss, and our findings suggest that ear tissue regeneration in Acomys may proceed through the assembly of a similar structure. This study underscores the importance of investigating regenerative phenomena outside of conventional model organisms, and suggests that mammals may retain a higher capacity for regeneration than was previously believed. As re-emergent interest in regenerative medicine seeks to isolate molecular pathways controlling tissue regeneration in mammals, Acomys may prove useful in identifying mechanisms to promote regeneration in lieu of fibrosis and scarring.","[Seifert, Ashley W.; Seifert, Megan G.; Palmer, Todd M.; Maden, Malcolm] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA; [Seifert, Ashley W.; Kiama, Stephen G.] Univ Nairobi, Dept Vet Anat & Physiol, Nairobi 00010, Kenya; [Seifert, Ashley W.; Seifert, Megan G.; Goheen, Jacob R.; Palmer, Todd M.] Mpala Res Ctr, Nanyuki 10400, Kenya; [Goheen, Jacob R.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool & Physiol, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Goheen, Jacob R.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Bot, Laramie, WY 82071 USA","Seifert, AW (reprint author), Univ Florida, Dept Biol, 223 Bartram Hall,POB 118525, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA.",seifert@ufl.edu,"Kiama, Stephen Gitahi/C-9595-2016","Kiama, Stephen Gitahi/0000-0002-0217-6283; Palmer, Todd/0000-0001-5710-9750",NIDDK NIH HHS [T32 DK074367],,,31,109,109,7,281,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Sep,2012,489,7417,,,,,561,+,,10.1038/nature11499,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,046RG,WOS:000311781500003,23018966.0,No,,,11/20/17,malcolm,maden,male,1,227,na,na

These viruses evade human immunity through the evolution of variants that resist neutralization. The identification of antibodies that recognize invariant structures on the influenza haemagglutinin (HA) protein have invigorated efforts to develop universal influenza vaccines. Specifically, antibodies to the highly conserved stem region of HA neutralize diverse viral subtypes. These antibodies largely derive from a specific antibody gene, heavy-chain variable region IGHV1-69, after limited affinity maturation from their germline ancestors(1,2), but how HA stimulates naive B cells to mature and induce protective immunity is unknown. To address this question, we analysed the structural and genetic basis for their engagement and maturation into broadly neutralizing antibodies. Here we show that the germline-encoded precursors of these antibodies act as functional B-cell antigen receptors (BCRs) that initiate subsequent affinity maturation. Neither the germline precursor of a prototypic antibody, CR6261 (ref. 3), nor those of two other natural human IGHV1-69 antibodies, bound HA as soluble immunoglobulin-G(IgG). However, all three IGHV1-69 precursors engaged HA when the antibody was expressed as cell surface IgM. HA triggered BCR-associated tyrosine kinase signalling by germline transmembrane IgM. Recognition and virus neutralization was dependent solely on the heavy chain, and affinity maturation of CR6261 required only seven amino acids in the complementarity-determining region (CDR) H1 and framework region 3 (FR3) to restore full activity. These findings provide insight into the initial events that lead to the generation of broadly neutralizing antibodies to influenza, informing the rational design of vaccines to elicit such antibodies and providing a model relevant to other infectious diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus/AIDS. The data further suggest that selected immunoglobulin genes recognize specific protein structural 'patterns' that provide a substrate for further affinity maturation.","[Lingwood, Daniel; McTamney, Patrick M.; Yassine, Hadi M.; Whittle, James R.

With age, the functional quality of HSCs declines, partly owing to the accumulation of damaged DNA(1-3). However, the factors that damage DNA and the protective mechanisms that operate in these cells are poorly understood. We have recently shown that the Fanconi anaemia DNA-repair pathway counteracts the genotoxic effects of reactive aldehydes(4,5). Mice with combined inactivation of aldehyde catabolism (through Aldh2 knockout) and the Fanconi anaemia DNA-repair pathway (Fancd2 knockout) display developmental defects, a predisposition to leukaemia, and are susceptible to the toxic effects of ethanol-an exogenous source of acetaldehyde(4). Here we report that aged Aldh2(-/-) Fancd2(-/-) mutant mice that do not develop leukaemia spontaneously develop aplastic anaemia, with the concomitant accumulation of damaged DNA within the haematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) pool. Unexpectedly, we find that only HSPCs, and not more mature blood precursors, require Aldh2 for protection against acetaldehyde toxicity. Additionally, the aldehyde-oxidizing activity of HSPCs, as measured by Aldefluor stain, is due to Aldh2 and correlates with this protection. Finally, there is more than a 600-fold reduction in the HSC pool of mice deficient in both Fanconi anaemia pathway-mediated DNA repair and acetaldehyde detoxification. Therefore, the emergence of bone marrow failure in Fanconi anaemia is probably due to aldehyde-mediated genotoxicity restricted to the HSPC pool. These findings identify a new link between endogenous reactive metabolites and DNA damage in HSCs, and define the protective mechanisms that counteract this threat.","[Garaycoechea, Juan I.; Crossan, Gerry P.; Langevin, Frederic; Daly, Maria; Patel, Ketan J.] MRC, Mol Biol Lab, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England; [Arends, Mark J.] Univ Cambridge, Addenbrookes Hosp, Dept Pathol, Cambridge CB2 2QQ, England; [Patel, Ketan J.] Univ Cambridge, Addenbrookes Hosp, Dept Med, Cambridge CB2 0QQ, England","Patel, KJ (reprint author), MRC, Mol Biol Lab, Hills Rd, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England.",kjp@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk,,"Crossan, Gerry/0000-0002-7974-009X","CRUK; Homerton College, Cambridge; Milstein Fund; Darwin Trust of Edinburgh; March of Dimes Foundation","We thank M.

Two redundant pathways of extensive resection have been described both in cells(1-3) and in vitro(4-6), one relying on Exo1 exonuclease and the other on Sgs1 helicase and Dna2 nuclease. However, it remains unknown how resection proceeds within the context of chromatin, where histones and histone-bound proteins represent barriers for resection enzymes. Here we identify the yeast nucleosome-remodelling enzyme Fun30 as a factor promoting DSB end resection. Fun30 is the major nucleosome remodeller promoting extensive Exo1- and Sgs1-dependent resection of DSBs. The RSC and INO80 chromatin-remodelling complexes and Fun30 have redundant roles in resection adjacent to DSB ends. ATPase and helicase domains of Fun30, which are needed for nucleosome remodelling(7), are also required for resection. Fun30 is robustly recruited to DNA breaks and spreads along the DSB coincident with resection. Fun30 becomes less important for resection in the absence of the histone-bound Rad9 checkpoint adaptor protein known to block 5' strand processing(8) and in the absence of either histone H3 K79 methylation or gamma-H2A, which mediate recruitment of Rad9 (refs 9, 10). Together these data suggest that Fun30 helps to overcome the inhibitory effect of Rad9 on DNA resection.","[Cui, Dandan; Tang, Jiangwu; Chen, Kaifu; Pan, Xuewen] Baylor Coll Med, Verna & Marrs McLean Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Chen, Xuefeng; Papusha, Alma; Zhang, Xiaotian; Chu, Chia-Dwo; Ira, Grzegorz] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Human Genet, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Pan, XW (reprint author), Baylor Coll Med, Verna & Marrs McLean Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, 1 Baylor Plaza, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",xuewenp@bcm.edu; gira@bcm.edu,"Chen, Xuefeng/C-3410-2013",,"National Institutes of Health [GM080600, HG004840]","We thank P.

The first step common to all homologous recombination reactions is the 5'-3' degradation of DSB ends that yields the 39 single-stranded DNA required for the loading of checkpoint and recombination proteins. In yeast, the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 complex (Xrs2 is known as NBN or NBS1 in humans) and Sae2 (known as RBBP8 or CTIP in humans) initiate end resection, whereas long-range resection depends on the exonuclease Exo1, or the helicase-topoisomerase complex Sgs1-Top3-Rmi1 together with the endonuclease Dna2 (refs 1-6). DSBs occur in the context of chromatin, but how the resection machinery navigates through nucleosomal DNA is a process that is not well understood(7). Here we show that the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae Fun30 protein and its human counterpart SMARCAD1 (ref. 8), two poorly characterized ATP-dependent chromatin remodellers of the Snf2 ATPase family, are directly involved in the DSB response. Fun30 physically associates with DSB ends and directly promotes both Exo1- and Sgs1-dependent end resection through a mechanism involving its ATPase activity. The function of Fun30 in resection facilitates the repair of camptothecin-induced DNA lesions, although it becomes dispensable when Exo1 is ectopically overexpressed. Interestingly, SMARCAD1 is also recruited to DSBs, and the kinetics of recruitment is similar to that of EXO1. The loss of SMARCAD1 impairs end resection and recombinational DNA repair, and renders cells hypersensitive to DNA damage resulting from camptothecin or poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor treatments. These findings unveil an evolutionarily conserved role for the Fun30 and SMARCAD1 chromatin remodellers in controlling end resection, homologous recombination and genome stability in the context of chromatin.","[Louge, Raphael; Khadaroo, Basheer; Dubois, Kenny; Llorente, Bertrand] Ctr Rech Cancerol Marseille, CNRS, Unite Mixte Rech 7258, F-13009 Marseille, France; [Costelloe, Thomas; Wiegant, Wouter W.; van Attikum, Haico] Leiden Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Toxicogenet, NL-2333 ZC Leiden, Netherlands; [Louge, Raphael; Khadaroo, Basheer; Dubois, Kenny; Llorente, Bertrand] Aix Marseille Univ, Unite Mixte Rech 7258, F-13284 Marseille, France; [Tomimatsu, Nozomi; Mukherjee, Bipasha; Burma, Sandeep] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Radiat Oncol, Div Mol Radiat Biol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Martini, Emmanuelle] CEA DSV Inst Radiobiol Cellulaire & Mol, F-92265 Fontenay Aux Roses, France; [Thierry, Agnes] Inst Pasteur, CNRS, Unite Genet Mol Levures, F-75724 Paris 15, France; [Thierry, Agnes] Univ Paris 06, F-75724 Paris 15, France","Llorente, B (reprint author), Ctr Rech Cancerol Marseille, CNRS, Unite Mixte Rech 7258, F-13009 Marseille, France.",h.van.attikum@lumc.nl; bllorente@ifr88.cnrs-mrs.fr,"van Attikum, Haico/A-4596-2010; llorente, bertrand/M-3501-2016","martini, emmanuelle/0000-0003-2005-0796; Van Attikum, Haico/0000-0001-8590-0240",National Institutes of Health [RO1 CA149461]; National Aeronautics and Space Administration [NNX10AE08G]; Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas [RP100644]; Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO-VIDI grant); Human Frontiers Science Program(HFSP-CDA grant); CNRS (ATIP); Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-10-BLAN-1606-03],"We thank G.

The Cit(+) trait originated in one clade by a tandem duplication that captured an aerobically expressed promoter for the expression of a previously silent citrate transporter. The clades varied in their propensity to evolve this novel trait, although genotypes able to do so existed in all three clades, implying that multiple potentiating mutations arose during the population's history.

Genomic alterations in squamous cell lung cancers have not been comprehensively characterized, and no molecularly targeted agents have been specifically developed for its treatment. As part of The Cancer Genome Atlas, here we profile 178 lung squamous cell carcinomas to provide a comprehensive landscape of genomic and epigenomic alterations. We show that the tumour type is characterized by complex genomic alterations, with a mean of 360 exonic mutations, 165 genomic rearrangements, and 323 segments of copy number alteration per tumour. We find statistically recurrent mutations in 11 genes, including mutation of TP53 in nearly all specimens. Previously unreported loss-of-function mutations are seen in the HLA-A class I major histocompatibility gene. Significantly altered pathways included NFE2L2 and KEAP1 in 34%, squamous differentiation genes in 44%, phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase pathway genes in 47%, and CDKN2A and RB1 in 72% of tumours. We identified a potential therapeutic target in most tumours, offering new avenues of investigation for the treatment of squamous cell lung cancers.","[Sivachenko, Andrey; McKenna, Aaron; Cherniack, Andrew D.; Crenshaw, Andrew; Hadjipanayis, Angela; Chen, Peng-Chieh; Kucherlapati, Raju] MIT, Eli & Edythe L Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Hammerman, Peter S.; Meyerson, Matthew; Beroukhim, Rameen; Hammerman, Peter S.; Meyerson, Matthew; Johnson, Bruce] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Lander, Eric S.] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Lander, Eric S.; Sougnez, Carrie] Harvard Univ, Dept Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Gabriel, Stacey; Getz, Gad; Sougnez, Carrie; Onofrio, Robert C.; Ardlie, Kristin] Harvard Univ, Genet Anal Platform, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Imielinski, Marcin; Meyerson, Matthew; Meyerson, Matthew; Imielinski, Marcin] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Chu, Andy; Chun, Hye-Jung E.; Mungall, Andrew J.; Pleasance, Erin; Robertson, A.

Single protein loops can mediate extremely high-affinity binding, but it is unclear whether such a mechanism is available to antibodies. Here we report the isolation and characterization of an antibody called C05, which neutralizes strains from multiple subtypes of influenza A virus, including H1, H2 and H3. X-ray and electron microscopy structures show that C05 recognizes conserved elements of the receptor-binding site on the haemagglutinin surface glycoprotein. Recognition of the haemagglutinin receptor-binding site is dominated by a single heavy-chain complementarity-determining region 3 loop, with minor contacts from heavy-chain complementarity-determining region 1, and is sufficient to achieve nanomolar binding with a minimal footprint. Thus, binding predominantly with a single loop can allow antibodies to target small, conserved functional sites on otherwise hypervariable antigens.","[Ekiert, Damian C.; Bhabha, Gira; Khayat, Reza; Lee, Jeong Hyun; Ward, Andrew B.; Wilson, Ian A.] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Kashyap, Arun K.; Dillon, Michael A.; O'Neil, Ryann E.; Faynboym, Aleksandr M.; Horowitz, Michael; Horowitz, Lawrence; Bhatt, Ramesh R.] Sea Lane Biotechnol, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA; [Steel, John; Palese, Peter] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Microbiol, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Rubrum, Adam; Webby, Richard] St Jude Childrens Res Hosp, Dept Infect Dis, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Lerner, Richard A.] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Chem, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Wilson, Ian A.] Scripps Res Inst, Skaggs Inst Chem Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Wilson, IA (reprint author), Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol Biol, 10550 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",ramesh.bhatt@sealanebio.com; wilson@scripps.edu,"Ward, Andrew/F-9203-2014","Ward, Andrew/0000-0001-7153-3769; Ekiert, Damian/0000-0002-2570-0404; Palese, Peter/0000-0002-0337-5823","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [P01AI058113]; Achievement Rewards for College Scientists Foundation [GM080209]; NIH Molecular Evolution Training Program; Skaggs Institute; Northeast Biodefense Center [U54-AI057158-Lipkin]; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [U01AI070373]; Center for Research on Influenza Pathogenesis NIAID [HHSN266200700010C]; DOE Office of Biological and Environmental Research; NIH, National Center for Research Resources, Biomedical Technology Program; National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS); National Cancer Institute [Y1-CO-1020]; NIGMS [Y1-GM-1104]; US Department of Energy, Basic Energy Sciences, Office of Science [DE-AC02-06CH11357]; NIH though the P41 program at the National Center for Research Resources [RR017573]; NIH [U54 GM094586]","We thank H.

The accretion could be slow, from an unevolved (main-sequence) or evolved (subgiant or giant) star(2,3) (the single-degenerate channel), or rapid, as the primary star breaks up a smaller orbiting white dwarf(3,4) (the double-degenerate channel). A companion star will survive the explosion only in the single-degenerate channel(5). Both channels might contribute to the production of type Ia supernovae(6,7), but the relative proportions of their contributions remain a fundamental puzzle in astronomy. Previous searches for remnant companions have revealed one possible case for SN 1572 (refs 8, 9), although that has been questioned(10). More recently, observations have restricted surviving companions to be small, main-sequence stars(11-13), ruling out giant companions but still allowing the single-degenerate channel. Here we report the results of a search for surviving companions of the progenitor of SN 1006 (ref. 14). None of the stars within 4 arc minutes of the apparent site of the explosion is associated with the supernova remnant, and we can firmly exclude all giant and subgiant stars from being companions of the progenitor. In combination with previous results, our findings indicate that fewer than 20 per cent of type Ia supernovae occur through the single-degenerate channel.","[Gonzalez Hernandez, Jonay I.] Inst Astrofis Canarias, E-38205 Tenerife, Spain; [Gonzalez Hernandez, Jonay I.] Univ La Laguna, Dept Astrofis, E-38206 Tenerife, Spain; [Ruiz-Lapuente, Pilar] CSIC, Inst Fis Fundamental, E-28006 Madrid, Spain; [Ruiz-Lapuente, Pilar; Canal, Ramon; Mendez, Javier] Univ Barcelona, Dept Astron, Inst Ciencies Cosmos, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; [Tabernero, Hugo M.; Montes, David] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Astrofis & Ciencias Atmosfera, Fac Ciencias Fis, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Mendez, Javier] Isaac Newton Grp Telescopes, Santa Cruz De La Palma, Spain; [Bedin, Luigi R.] INAF Osservatorio Astron Padova, I-35122 Padua, Italy","Hernandez, JIG (reprint author), Inst Astrofis Canarias, E-38205 Tenerife, Spain.",jonay@iac.es; pilar@am.ub.es,"Montes, David/B-9329-2014; Gonzalez Hernandez, Jonay I./L-3556-2014","Montes, David/0000-0002-7779-238X; Gonzalez Hernandez, Jonay I./0000-0002-0264-7356; bedin, luigi/0000-0003-4080-6466; Tabernero, Hugo/0000-0002-8087-4298",Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion (MICINN); Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM); Comunidad de Madrid,"This work was supported by the Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion (MICINN), the Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM) and the Comunidad de Madrid, and is based on observations collected with the UVES spectrograph at the VLT/UT2 8.2-m Kueyen Telescope (ESO run ID, 69.D-0397(A)) at the Paranal Observatory, Chile.

If new connections are made preferentially to more popular nodes, then the resulting distribution of the number of connections possessed by nodes follows power laws(3,4), as observed in many real networks(5,6). Preferential attachment has been directly validated for some real networks (including the Internet(7,8)), and can be a consequence of different underlying processes based on node fitness, ranking, optimization, random walks or duplication(9-16). Here we show that popularity is just one dimension of attractiveness; another dimension is similarity(17-24). We develop a framework in which new connections optimize certain trade-offs between popularity and similarity, instead of simply preferring popular nodes. The framework has a geometric interpretation in which popularity preference emerges from local optimization. As opposed to preferential attachment, our optimization framework accurately describes the large-scale evolution of technological (the Internet), social (trust relationships between people) and biological (Escherichia coli metabolic) networks, predicting the probability of new links with high precision. The framework that we have developed can thus be used for predicting new links in evolving networks, and provides a different perspective on preferential attachment as an emergent phenomenon.","[Papadopoulos, Fragkiskos] Cyprus Univ Technol, Dept Elect Engn Comp Engn & Informat, CY-3036 Limassol, Cyprus; [Kitsak, Maksim; Krioukov, Dmitri] Univ Calif San Diego, CAIDA, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Angeles Serrano, M.; Boguna, Marian] Univ Barcelona, Dept Fis Fonamental, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain","Papadopoulos, F (reprint author), Cyprus Univ Technol, Dept Elect Engn Comp Engn & Informat, 33 Saripolou St, CY-3036 Limassol, Cyprus.",f.papadopoulos@cut.ac.cy; dima@ucsd.edu,"Serrano, M.

Atoms have been successfully used to store and process quantum information in electromagnetic traps(1), as well as in diamond through the use of the nitrogen-vacancy-centre point defect(2). Solid-state electrical devices possess great potential to scale up such demonstrations from few-qubit control to larger-scale quantum processors. Coherent control of spin qubits has been achieved in lithographically defined double quantum dots in both GaAs (refs 3-5) and Si (ref. 6). However, it is a formidable challenge to combine the electrical measurement capabilities of engineered nanostructures with the benefits inherent in atomic spin qubits. Here we demonstrate the coherent manipulation of an individual electron spin qubit bound to a phosphorus donor atom in natural silicon, measured electrically via single-shot read-out(7-9). We use electron spin resonance to drive Rabi oscillations, and a Hahn echo pulse sequence reveals a spin coherence time exceeding 200 mu s.

It has been suggested that an oxygenation event in the wake of the severe Marinoan glaciation was the driving factor behind this early diversification of metazoans and the shift in ecosystem complexity(7,8). But there is little evidence for an increase in oceanic or atmospheric oxygen following the Marinoan glaciation, or for a direct link between early animal evolution and redox conditions in general(9). Models linking trends in early biological evolution to shifts in Earth system processes thus remain controversial(10). Here we report geochemical data from early Ediacaran organic-rich black shales (similar to 635-630 million years old) of the basal Doushantuo Formation in South China. High enrichments of molybdenum and vanadium and low pyrite sulphur isotope values (Delta S-34 values >= 65 per mil) in these shales record expansion of the oceanic inventory of redox-sensitive metals and the growth of the marine sulphate reservoir in response to a widely oxygenated ocean. The data provide evidence for an early Ediacaran oxygenation event, which pre-dates the previous estimates for post-Marinoan oxygenation(11-13) by more than 50 million years. Our findings seem to support a link between the most severe glaciations in Earth's history, the oxygenation of the Earth's surface environments, and the earliest diversification of animals.","[Sahoo, Swapan K.; Jiang, Ganqing] Univ Nevada, Dept Geosci, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA; [Planavsky, Noah J.; Lyons, Timothy W.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Earth Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Kendall, Brian; Anbar, Ariel D.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Earth & Space Explorat, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Wang, Xinqiang; Shi, Xiaoying] China Univ Geosci, Sch Earth Sci & Resources, Beijing 10008, Peoples R China; [Scott, Clint] McGill Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Montreal, PQ H3A 2A7, Canada; [Anbar, Ariel D.] Arizona State Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA","Jiang, GQ (reprint author), Univ Nevada, Dept Geosci, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA.",Ganqing.Jiang@unlv.edu,"Kendall, Brian/I-6820-2012; Jiang, Ganqing/A-9557-2011",,National Science Foundation Division of Earth Science; NASA Astrobiology programme; National Natural Science Foundation of China,"This study was supported by the National Science Foundation Division of Earth Science, NASA Astrobiology programme and National Natural Science Foundation of China.

Although the sensitivity of terrestrial and deep marine carbon pools to climate change has been studied for decades, there is little understanding of how coastal carbon accumulation rates will change and potentially feed back on climate(2,3). Here we develop a numerical model of salt marsh evolution, informed by recent measurements of productivity and decomposition, and demonstrate that competition between mineral sediment deposition and organic-matter accumulation determines the net impact of climate change on carbon accumulation in intertidal wetlands. We find that the direct impact of warming on soil carbon accumulation rates is more subtle than the impact of warming-driven sea level rise, although the impact of warming increases with increasing rates of sea level rise. Our simulations suggest that the net impact of climate change will be to increase carbon burial rates in the first half of the twenty-first century, but that carbon-climate feedbacks are likely to diminish over time.","[Kirwan, Matthew L.] Univ Virginia, Dept Environm Sci, Charlottesville, VA 24151 USA; [Mudd, Simon M.] Univ Edinburgh, Sch GeoSci, Edinburgh EH8 9XP, Midlothian, Scotland; [Mudd, Simon M.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Earth Res Inst, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Kirwan, ML (reprint author), Univ Virginia, Dept Environm Sci, POB 400123, Charlottesville, VA 24151 USA.",mlk4n@virginia.edu,"Mudd, Simon/F-8521-2010","Mudd, Simon/0000-0002-1357-8501",USGS Global Change Research Program,We appreciate reviews by S.

When bosons interact, disorder can destroy condensation, leading to a 'Bose glass'. This phase has been very elusive in experiments owing to the absence of any broken symmetry and to the simultaneous absence of a finite energy gap in the spectrum. Here we report the observation of a Bose glass of field-induced magnetic quasiparticles in a doped quantum magnet (bromine-doped dichloro-tetrakis-thiourea-nickel, DTN). The physics of DTN in a magnetic field is equivalent to that of a lattice gas of bosons in the grand canonical ensemble; bromine doping introduces disorder into the hopping and interaction strength of the bosons, leading to their localization into a Bose glass down to zero field, where it becomes an incompressible Mott glass. The transition from the Bose glass (corresponding to a gapless spin liquid) to the Bose-Einstein condensate (corresponding to a magnetically ordered phase) is marked by a universal exponent that governs the scaling of the critical temperature with the applied field, in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. Our study represents a quantitative experimental account of the universal features of disordered bosons in the grand canonical ensemble.","[Roscilde, Tommaso] Ecole Normale Super Lyon, Lab Phys, CNRS, UMR5672, F-69364 Lyon, France; [Yu, Rong] Rice Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Yin, Liang; Sullivan, Neil S.; Xia, J.

The neural mechanisms responsible for cognitive deficit and autism-spectrum behaviours in Dravet's syndrome are poorly understood. Here we report that mice with Scn1a haploinsufficiency exhibit hyperactivity, stereotyped behaviours, social interaction deficits and impaired context-dependent spatial memory. Olfactory sensitivity is retained, but novel food odours and social odours are aversive to Scn1a(+/-) mice. GABAergic neurotransmission is specifically impaired by this mutation, and selective deletion of Na(V)1.1 channels in forebrain interneurons is sufficient to cause these behavioural and cognitive impairments. Remarkably, treatment with low-dose clonazepam, a positive allosteric modulator of GABA(A) receptors, completely rescued the abnormal social behaviours and deficits in fear memory in the mouse model of Dravet's syndrome, demonstrating that they are caused by impaired GABAergic neurotransmission and not by neuronal damage from recurrent seizures. These results demonstrate a critical role for Na(V)1.1 channels in neuropsychiatric functions and provide a potential therapeutic strategy for cognitive deficit and autism-spectrum behaviours in Dravet's syndrome.","[Han, Sung; de la Iglesia, Horacio O.; Catterall, William A.] Univ Washington, Graduate Program Neurobiol & Behav, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Han, Sung; Tai, Chao; Westenbroek, Ruth E.; Yu, Frank H.; Cheah, Christine S.; Scheuer, Todd; Catterall, William A.] Univ Washington, Dept Pharmacol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Han, Sung; de la Iglesia, Horacio O.] Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Potter, Gregory B.; Rubenstein, John L.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Psychiat, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA","Catterall, WA (reprint author), Univ Washington, Graduate Program Neurobiol & Behav, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",horaciod@uw.edu; wcatt@uw.edu,,"Yu, Frank/0000-0001-9306-1731; Potter, Gregory/0000-0002-0585-6575","National Institutes of Health [R01 NS25704, R01 MH075016, R37 MH049428]; McKnight Foundation","This work was supported by Research Grants R01 NS25704 (W.

Here we describe the generation and analysis of a transcriptional atlas of the adult human brain, comprising extensive histological analysis and comprehensive microarray profiling of similar to 900 neuroanatomically precise subdivisions in two individuals. Transcriptional regulation varies enormously by anatomical location, with different regions and their constituent cell types displaying robust molecular signatures that are highly conserved between individuals. Analysis of differential gene expression and gene co-expression relationships demonstrates that brain-wide variation strongly reflects the distributions of major cell classes such as neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and microglia. Local neighbourhood relationships between fine anatomical subdivisions are associated with discrete neuronal subtypes and genes involved with synaptic transmission. The neocortex displays a relatively homogeneous transcriptional pattern, but with distinct features associated selectively with primary sensorimotor cortices and with enriched frontal lobe expression. Notably, the spatial topography of the neocortex is strongly reflected in its molecular topography-the closer two cortical regions, the more similar their transcriptomes. This freely accessible online data resource forms a high-resolution transcriptional baseline for neurogenetic studies of normal and abnormal human brain function.","[Hawrylycz, Michael J.; Lein, Ed S.; Guillozet-Bongaarts, Angela L.; Shen, Elaine H.; Ng, Lydia; Miller, Jeremy A.; Smith, Kimberly A.; Ebbert, Amanda; Riley, Zackery L.; Abajian, Chris; Bernard, Amy; Bertagnolli, Darren; Boe, Andrew F.; Chakravarty, M.

Here we show that psalmotoxin activates non-selective and Na+-selective currents in chicken ASIC1a at pH 7.25 and 5.5, respectively. Crystal structures of ASIC1a-psalmotoxin complexes map the toxin binding site to the extracellular domain and show how toxin binding triggers an expansion of the extracellular vestibule and stabilization of the open channel pore. At pH 7.25 the pore is approximately 10 angstrom in diameter, whereas at pH 5.5 the pore is largely hydrophobic and elliptical in cross-section with dimensions of approximately 5 by 7 angstrom, consistent with a barrier mechanism for ion selectivity.

Those young galaxies (where the bulk of stars formed) at a cosmic age of less than about 500 million years (z less than or similar to 10) remain largely unexplored because they are at or beyond the sensitivity limits of existing large telescopes. Understanding the properties of these galaxies is critical to identifying the source of the radiation that re-ionized the intergalactic medium. Gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters allows the detection of high-redshift galaxies fainter than what otherwise could be found in the deepest images of the sky(2). Here we report multiband observations of the cluster MACS J1149+2223 that have revealed (with high probability) a gravitationally magnified galaxy from the early Universe, at a redshift of z = 9.6 +/- 0.2 (that is, a cosmic age of 490 +/- 15 million years, or 3.6 per cent of the age of the Universe). We estimate that it formed less than 200 million years after the Big Bang (at the 95 per cent confidence level), implying a formation redshift of less than or similar to 14. Given the small sky area that our observations cover, faint galaxies seem to be abundant at such a young cosmic age, suggesting that they may be the dominant source for the early re-ionization of the intergalactic medium.","[Zheng, Wei; Ford, Holland; Medezinski, Elinor; Lemze, Doron] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Postman, Marc; Bradley, Larry; Coe, Dan; Koekemoer, Anton; Ogaz, Sara] Space Telescope Sci Inst, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Zitrin, Adi; Bartelmann, Matthias] Heidelberg Univ, Inst Theoret Astrophys, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Moustakas, John] Siena Coll, Dept Phys & Astron, Loudonville, NY 12211 USA; [Shu, Xinwen] Univ Sci & Technol China, Dept Astron, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Jouvel, Stephanie; Host, Ole; Lahav, Ofer] UCL, Dept Phys & Astron, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Jouvel, Stephanie] Inst Ciencies Espai, Bellaterra 08193, Spain; [Molino, Alberto; Benitez, Narciso] Inst Astrofis Andalucia, E-18008 Granada, Spain; [Moustakas, Leonidas A.; Merten, Julian] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA; [Carrasco, Mauricio; Infante, Leopoldo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Astron & Astrofis, Santiago 22, Chile; [Lauer, Tod R.] Natl Opt Astron Observ, Tucson, AZ 85726 USA; [Seitz, Stella] Univ Sternwarte Munchen, D-81679 Munich, Germany; [Bouwens, Rychard] Leiden Univ, Leiden Observ, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands; [Broadhurst, Tom] Univ Basque Country, Dept Theoret Phys, Bilbao 48080, Spain; [Broadhurst, Tom] Basque Fdn Sci, Ikerbasque, Bilbao 48011, Spain; [Donahue, Megan] Michigan State Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Grillo, Claudio] Univ Copenhagen, Dark Cosmol Ctr, Niels Bohr Inst, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Jha, Saurabh W.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; [Kelson, Daniel D.] Observ Carnegie Inst Sci, Pasadena, CA 91101 USA; [Melchior, Peter] Ohio State Univ, Dept Phys, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Nonino, Mario] INAF Osservatorio Astron Trieste, I-40131 Trieste, Italy; [Meneghetti, Massimo] INAF Osservatorio Astron Bologna, I-40127 Bologna, Italy; [Rosati, Piero] European So Observ, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Umetsu, Keiichi] Acad Sinica, Inst Astron & Astrophys, Taipei 10617, Taiwan; [van der Wel, Arjen] Max Planck Inst Astron, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany","Zheng, W (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",zheng@pha.jhu.edu,"; Bartelmann, Matthias/A-5336-2014; Molino Benito, Alberto/F-5298-2014; Grillo, Claudio/E-6223-2015; Meneghetti, Massimo/O-8139-2015; Shu, Xinwen/D-7294-2017","Koekemoer, Anton/0000-0002-6610-2048; Bartelmann, Matthias/0000-0001-6951-3582; Jha, Saurabh/0000-0001-8738-6011; Moustakas, John/0000-0002-2733-4559; Benitez, Narciso/0000-0002-0403-7455; Umetsu, Keiichi/0000-0002-7196-4822; Molino Benito, Alberto/0000-0002-3630-0940; Grillo, Claudio/0000-0002-5926-7143; Melchior, Peter/0000-0002-8873-5065; Meneghetti, Massimo/0000-0003-1225-7084; Shu, Xinwen/0000-0002-7020-4290; Nonino, Mario/0000-0001-6342-9662; Moustakas, Leonidas/0000-0003-3030-2360",NASA [NAS 5-26555]; NSF [AST-0908246]; Baden Wurttemberg Stiftung,"The CLASH programme (GO-12065) is based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope.

EPR can also probe the interplay of light and electricity in organic solar cells(5-7) and light-emitting diodes(8), and the origin of decoherence in condensed matter, which is of fundamental importance to the development of quantum information processors(9-13). Like nuclear magnetic resonance, EPR spectroscopy becomes more powerful at high magnetic fields and frequencies, and with excitation by coherent pulses rather than continuous waves. However, the difficulty of generating sequences of powerful pulses at frequencies above 100 gigahertz has, until now, confined high-power pulsed EPR to magnetic fields of 3.5 teslas and below. Here we demonstrate that one-kilowatt pulses from a free-electron laser can power a pulsed EPR spectrometer at 240 gigahertz (8.5 teslas), providing transformative enhancements over the alternative, a state-of-the-art similar to 30-milliwatt solid-state source. Our spectrometer can rotate spin-1/2 electrons through pi/2 in only 6 nanoseconds (compared to 300 nanoseconds with the solid-state source). Fourier-transform EPR on nitrogen impurities in diamond demonstrates excitation and detection of EPR lines separated by about 200 megahertz. We measured decoherence times as short as 63 nanoseconds, in a frozen solution of nitroxide free-radicals at temperatures as high as 190 kelvin. Both free-electron lasers and the quasi-optical technology developed for the spectrometer are scalable to frequencies well in excess of one terahertz, opening the way to high-power pulsed EPR spectroscopy up to the highest static magnetic fields currently available.","[Takahashi, S.; Brunel, L. -C.; Han, S.; Sherwin, M.

However, the practical realization of thermoelectric materials is limited by their hitherto low figure of merit, ZT, which governs the Carnot efficiency according to the second law of thermodynamics. The recent successful strategy of nanostructuring to reduce thermal conductivity has achieved record-high ZT values in the range 1.5-1.8 at 750-900 kelvin(1-3), but still falls short of the generally desired threshold value of 2. Nanostructures in bulk thermoelectrics allow effective phonon scattering of a significant portion of the phonon spectrum, but phonons with long mean free paths remain largely unaffected. Here we show that heat-carrying phonons with long mean free paths can be scattered by controlling and fine-tuning the mesoscale architecture of nanostructured thermoelectric materials. Thus, by considering sources of scattering on all relevant length scales in a hierarchical fashion-from atomic-scale lattice disorder and nanoscale endotaxial precipitates to mesoscale grain boundaries-we achieve the maximum reduction in lattice thermal conductivity and a large enhancement in the thermoelectric performance of PbTe. By taking such a panoscopic approach to the scattering of heat-carrying phonons across integrated length scales, we go beyond nanostructuring and demonstrate a ZT value of similar to 2.2 at 915 kelvin in p-type PbTe endotaxially nanostructured with SrTe at a concentration of 4 mole per cent and mesostructured with powder processing and spark plasma sintering. This increase in ZT beyond the threshold of 2 highlights the role of, and need for, multiscale hierarchical architecture in controlling phonon scattering in bulk thermoelectrics, and offers a realistic prospect of the recovery of a significant portion of waste heat.","[Biswas, Kanishka; He, Jiaqing; Kanatzidis, Mercouri G.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Chem, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Wu, Chun-I; Hogan, Timothy P.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Kanatzidis, Mercouri G.] Argonne Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Argonne, IL 60439 USA","Kanatzidis, MG (reprint author), Northwestern Univ, Dept Chem, 2145 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",m-kanatzidis@northwestern.edu,"Blum, Ivan/C-6230-2013; Dravid, Vinayak/B-6688-2009; Seidman, David/B-6697-2009; Leon-Lugo, Nathyely/H-5680-2015","Blum, Ivan/0000-0002-4729-6510; Leon-Lugo, Nathyely/0000-0001-6576-7040","Energy Frontier Research Center for Revolutionary Materials for Solid State Energy Conversion; US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences [DE-SC0001054]; ONR DURIP [N00014-0400798, N00014-0610539, N00014-0910781]; NSF-MRI [DMR-0420532]; MRSEC [DMR-1121262]; ISEN at Northwestern University","This work was supported by the Energy Frontier Research Center for Revolutionary Materials for Solid State Energy Conversion, funded by the US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences under award number DE-SC0001054.

This condition is thought to arise from biological control over the ocean's nitrogen budget, in which removal of bioavailable nitrogen by denitrifying bacteria ensures widespread selection for diazotrophic phytoplankton that replenish this essential nutrient when it limits the growth of other species(1-3). Here we show that in the context of a realistic ocean circulation model, and a uniform N:P ratio of plankton biomass, this feedback mechanism yields an oceanic nitrate deficit more than double its observed value. The critical missing phenomenon is diversity in the metabolic N: P requirement of phytoplankton, which has recently been shown to exhibit large-scale patterns associated with species composition(4). When we model these variations, such that diazotrophs compete with high N: P communities in subtropical regions, the ocean nitrogen inventory rises and may even exceed the average N: P ratio of plankton. The latter condition, previously considered impossible, is prevented in the modern ocean by shallow circulations that communicate stoichiometric signals from remote biomes dominated by diatoms with low N: P ratios. Large-scale patterns of plankton diversity and the circulation pathways connecting them are thus key factors determining the availability of fixed nitrogen in the ocean.","[Weber, Thomas; Deutsch, Curtis] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Weber, T (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",tweber@atmos.ucla.edu,,,NASA Earth Systems Science Fellowship; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation,We thank T.

During dry periods, soil-water deficit can limit evapotranspiration, leading to warmer and drier conditions in the lower atmosphere(1,2). Soil moisture can influence the development of convective storms through such modifications of low-level atmospheric temperature and humidity(1,3), which in turn feeds back on soil moisture. Yet there is considerable uncertainty in how soil moisture affects convective storms across the world, owing to a lack of observational evidence and uncertainty in large-scale models(4). Here we present a global-scale observational analysis of the coupling between soil moisture and precipitation. We show that across all six continents studied, afternoon rain falls preferentially over soils that are relatively dry compared to the surrounding area. The signal emerges most clearly in the observations over semi-arid regions, where surface fluxes are sensitive to soil moisture, and convective events are frequent. Mechanistically, our results are consistent with enhanced afternoon moist convection driven by increased sensible heat flux over drier soils, and/or mesoscale variability in soil moisture. We find no evidence in our analysis of a positive feedback-that is, a preference for rain over wetter soils-at the spatial scale (50-100 kilometres) studied. In contrast, we find that a positive feedback of soil moisture on simulated precipitation does dominate in six state-of-the-art global weather and climate models-a difference that may contribute to excessive simulated droughts in large-scale models.","[Taylor, Christopher M.; Harris, Phil P.] NERC Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England; [de Jeu, Richard A.

However, choosing to cooperate requires individuals to incur a personal cost to benefit others. Here we explore the cognitive basis of cooperative decision-making in humans using a dual-process framework(10-18). We ask whether people are predisposed towards selfishness, behaving cooperatively only through active self-control; or whether they are intuitively cooperative, with reflection and prospective reasoning favouring 'rational' self-interest. To investigate this issue, we perform ten studies using economic games. We find that across a range of experimental designs, subjects who reach their decisions more quickly are more cooperative. Furthermore, forcing subjects to decide quickly increases contributions, whereas instructing them to reflect and forcing them to decide slowly decreases contributions. Finally, an induction that primes subjects to trust their intuitions increases contributions compared with an induction that promotes greater reflection. To explain these results, we propose that cooperation is intuitive because cooperative heuristics are developed in daily life where cooperation is typically advantageous. We then validate predictions generated by this proposed mechanism. Our results provide convergent evidence that intuition supports cooperation in social dilemmas, and that reflection can undermine these cooperative impulses.","[Rand, David G.; Nowak, Martin A.] Harvard Univ, Program Evolutionary Dynam, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Rand, David G.; Greene, Joshua D.] Harvard Univ, Dept Psychol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Rand, David G.] Yale Univ, Dept Psychol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Nowak, Martin A.] Harvard Univ, Dept Math, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Nowak, Martin A.] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Rand, DG (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Program Evolutionary Dynam, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",drand@fas.harvard.edu,"Rand, David/B-3716-2009","Rand, David/0000-0002-2821-468X; Rand, David/0000-0001-8975-2783",National Science Foundation [SES-0821978]; John Templeton Foundation,"We thank H.

However, little is known about the chemical communication, if any, that is involved in this interaction or the relative importance of microarthropod dispersal compared to abiotic dispersal agents in mosses. Here we show that tissues of the cosmopolitan moss Ceratodon purpureus emit complex volatile scents, similar in chemical diversity to those described in pollination mutualisms between flowering plants and insects, that the chemical composition of C. purpureus volatiles are sex-specific, and that moss-dwelling microarthropods are differentially attracted to these sex-specific moss volatile cues. Furthermore, using experimental microcosms, we show that microarthropods significantly increase moss fertilization rates, even in the presence of water spray, highlighting the important role of microarthropod dispersal in contributing to moss mating success. Taken together, our results indicate the presence of a scent-based 'plant-pollinator-like' relationship that has evolved between two of Earth's most ancient terrestrial lineages, mosses and microarthropods.","[Rosenstiel, Todd N.; Shortlidge, Erin E.; Melnychenko, Andrea N.; Eppley, Sarah M.] Portland State Univ, Dept Biol, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Rosenstiel, Todd N.; Shortlidge, Erin E.; Melnychenko, Andrea N.; Eppley, Sarah M.] Portland State Univ, Ctr Life Extreme Environm, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Pankow, James F.] Portland State Univ, Dept Chem, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Pankow, James F.] Portland State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Portland, OR 97201 USA","Eppley, SM (reprint author), Portland State Univ, Dept Biol, 1719 SW 10th Ave, Portland, OR 97201 USA.",eppley@pdx.edu,,,"3M Corporation; National Science Foundation [DEB-0743461, IOS-0719570]","We are grateful to W.

The best-understood correlate of this function is the enhanced response of neurons in the visual cortex to attended stimuli(1,2). However, recent results show that the superior colliculus (SC), a midbrain structure, also has a crucial role in visual attention(3-5). It has been assumed that the SC acts through the same well-known mechanisms in the visual cortex(3,5). Here we tested this hypothesis by transiently inactivating the SC during a motion-change-detection task and measuring responses in two visual cortical areas. We found that despite large deficits in visual attention, the enhanced responses of neurons in the visual cortex to attended stimuli were unchanged. These results show that the SC contributes to visual attention through mechanisms that are independent of the classic effects in the visual cortex, demonstrating that other processes must have key roles in visual attention.","[Zenon, Alexandre; Krauzlis, Richard J.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Syst Neurobiol Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Zenon, Alexandre] Catholic Univ Louvain, Inst Neurosci, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium; [Krauzlis, Richard J.] NEI, Lab Sensorimotor Res, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Krauzlis, RJ (reprint author), Salk Inst Biol Studies, Syst Neurobiol Lab, 10010 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",richard.krauzlis@nih.gov,,"Richard, Krauzlis/0000-0002-1826-0447",F.M.

Identification of these retrograde signals has proved elusive, but their production by muscle depends on the receptor tyrosine kinase, MuSK (muscle, skeletal receptor tyrosine-protein kinase), and Lrp4 (low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR)-related protein 4), an LDLR family member that forms a complex with MuSK, binds neural agrin and stimulates MuSK kinase activity(2-5). Here we show that Lrp4 also functions as a direct muscle-derived retrograde signal for early steps in presynaptic differentiation. We demonstrate that Lrp4 is necessary, independent of MuSK activation, for presynaptic differentiation in vivo, and we show that Lrp4 binds to motor axons and induces clustering of synaptic-vesicle and active-zone proteins. Thus, Lrp4 acts bidirectionally and coordinates synapse formation by binding agrin, activating MuSK and stimulating postsynaptic differentiation, and functioning in turn as a muscle-derived retrograde signal that is necessary and sufficient for presynaptic differentiation.","[Yumoto, Norihiro; Kim, Natalie; Burden, Steven J.] NYU, Sch Med, Mol Neurobiol Program,Skirball Inst Biomol Med, Helen L & Martin S Kimmel Ctr Biol & Med, New York, NY 10012 USA","Burden, SJ (reprint author), NYU, Sch Med, Mol Neurobiol Program,Skirball Inst Biomol Med, Helen L & Martin S Kimmel Ctr Biol & Med, 540 1st Ave, New York, NY 10012 USA.",burden@saturn.med.nyu.edu,,,New York University Cancer Institute Center Support Grant (National Institutes of Health (NIH)/National Cancer Institute (NCI)) [5 P30CA16087-31]; National Institutes of Health [NS36193]; Skirball Institute; New York State Stem Cell Science (NYSTEM),"We thank L.

Although highlighted by the strong protective effect of the sickle-cell trait(2,3), the full impact of human genetics on resistance to the disease remains largely unexplored(4). Genome-wide association (GWA) studies are designed to unravel relevant genetic variants comprehensively; however, in malaria, as in other infectious diseases, these studies have been only partly successful(5). Here we identify two previously unknown loci associated with severe falciparum malaria in patients and controls from Ghana, West Africa. We applied the GWA approach to the diverse clinical syndromes of severe falciparum malaria, thereby targeting human genetic variants influencing any step in the complex pathogenesis of the disease. One of the loci was identified on chromosome 1q32 within the ATP2B4 gene, which encodes the main calcium pump of erythrocytes(6), the host cells of the pathogenic stage of malaria parasites. The second was indicated by an intergenic single nucleotide polymorphism on chromosome 16q22.2, possibly linked to a neighbouring gene encoding the tight-junction protein MARVELD3. The protein is expressed on endothelial cells(7) and might therefore have a role in microvascular damage caused by endothelial adherence of parasitized erythrocytes. We also confirmed previous reports on protective effects of the sickle-cell trait and blood group O-5,O-8,O-9. Our findings underline the potential of the GWA approach to provide candidates for the development of control measures against infectious diseases in humans.","[Timmann, Christian; Thye, Thorsten; Evans, Jennifer; Ehmen, Christa; Sievertsen, Juergen; Muntau, Birgit; Ruge, Gerd; Brendel, Michael; Schuldt, Kathrin; Meyer, Christian G.; Horstmann, Rolf D.] Bernhard Nocht Inst Trop Med, Dept Mol Med, D-20359 Hamburg, Germany; [Timmann, Christian; Thye, Thorsten; Vens, Maren; Brendel, Michael; Loley, Christina; Ziegler, Andreas] Med Univ Lubeck, Inst Med Biometry & Stat, D-23562 Lubeck, Germany; [Evans, Jennifer] Kumasi Ctr Collaborat Res Trop Med, Kumasi, Ghana; [May, Juergen; Loag, Wibke] Bernhard Nocht Inst Trop Med, Infect Dis Epidemiol Grp, D-20359 Hamburg, Germany; [Ansong, Daniel; Antwi, Sampson; Asafo-Adjei, Emanuel; Nguah, Samuel Blay; Kwakye, Kingsley Osei; Akoto, Alex Osei Yaw; Sylverken, Justice; Agbenyega, Tsiri] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Med Sci, Kumasi, Ghana; [Franke, Andre] Univ Kiel, Inst Clin Mol Biol, D-24105 Kiel, Germany","Timmann, C (reprint author), Bernhard Nocht Inst Trop Med, Dept Mol Med, Bernhard Nocht Str 74, D-20359 Hamburg, Germany.",timmann@bnitm.de,"Franke, Andre/B-2151-2010","Franke, Andre/0000-0003-1530-5811; Ziegler, Andreas/0000-0002-8386-5397; ANSONG, Daniel/0000-0003-1328-9117","National Genome Research Network of the German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) [NGFN1, NGFN2]; Wellcome Trust [WT077383/Z/05/Z]; Foundation for the National Institutes of Health, Bill & Melinda Gates' Grand Challenges in Global Health Initiative [566]","We thank the participating children, their parents and guardians; L.

In some cases, however, epigenetic information can be transmitted from parent to progeny (multigenerational epigenetic inheritance)(2). A particularly notable example of this type of epigenetic inheritance is double-stranded RNA-mediated gene silencing in Caenorhabditis elegans. This RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) can be inherited for more than five generations(3-8). To understand this process, here we conduct a genetic screen for nematodes defective in transmitting RNAi silencing signals to future generations. This screen identified the heritable RNAi defective 1 (hrde-1) gene. hrde-1 encodes an Argonaute protein that associates with small interfering RNAs in the germ cells of progeny of animals exposed to double-stranded RNA. In the nuclei of these germ cells, HRDE-1 engages the nuclear RNAi defective pathway to direct the trimethylation of histone H3 at Lys 9 (H3K9me3) at RNAi-targeted genomic loci and promote RNAi inheritance. Under normal growth conditions, HRDE-1 associates with endogenously expressed short interfering RNAs, which direct nuclear gene silencing in germ cells. In hrde-1- or nuclear RNAi-deficient animals, germline silencing is lost over generational time. Concurrently, these animals exhibit steadily worsening defects in gamete formation and function that ultimately lead to sterility. These results establish that the Argonaute protein HRDE-1 directs gene-silencing events in germ-cell nuclei that drive multigenerational RNAi inheritance and promote immortality of the germ-cell lineage. We propose that C. elegans use the RNAi inheritance machinery to transmit epigenetic information, accrued by past generations, into future generations to regulate important biological processes.","[Buckley, Bethany A.; Burkhart, Kirk B.; Spracklin, George; Fritz, Heidi; Kimble, Judith; Kennedy, Scott] Univ Wisconsin, Lab Genet, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Gu, Sam Guoping; Fire, Andrew] Stanford Univ, Dept Pathol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Gu, Sam Guoping; Fire, Andrew] Stanford Univ, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kershner, Aaron; Fritz, Heidi] Univ Wisconsin, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Kershner, Aaron; Kimble, Judith] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biochem, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Kennedy, S (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Lab Genet, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",sgkennedy@wisc.edu,,,"Pew scholar's program; Shaw scholar's program; National Institutes of Health [GM88289, GM37706, GM069454]","We thank P.

In the absence of Set2, H3K36 or Rpd3S acetylated histones accumulate on open reading frames (ORFs), leading to transcription initiation from cryptic promoters within ORFs(1,3). Although the co-transcriptional deacetylation pathway is well characterized, the factors responsible for acetylation are as yet unknown. Here we show that, in yeast, co-transcriptional acetylation is achieved in part by histone exchange over ORFs. In addition to its function of targeting and activating the Rpd3S complex, H3K36 methylation suppresses the interaction of H3 with histone chaperones, histone exchange over coding regions and the incorporation of new acetylated histones. Thus, Set2 functions both to suppress the incorporation of acetylated histones and to signal for the deacetylation of these histones in transcribed genes. By suppressing spurious cryptic transcripts from initiating within ORFs, this pathway is essential to maintain the accuracy of transcription by RNA polymerase II.","[Venkatesh, Swaminathan; Smolle, Michaela; Li, Hua; Gogol, Madelaine M.; Workman, Jerry L.] Stowers Inst Med Res, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; [Saint, Malika; Kumar, Shambhu; Natarajan, Krishnamurthy] Jawarharlal Nehru Univ, Sch Life Sci, New Delhi 110067, India","Workman, JL (reprint author), Stowers Inst Med Res, 1000 E 50th St, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA.",jlw@stowers.org,,"Venkatesh, Swaminathan/0000-0001-9837-1501; Smolle, Michaela/0000-0001-8900-1541; Gogol, Madelaine/0000-0002-8738-0995",National Institutes of Health [R01GM04867]; Stowers Institute for Medical Research,"We thank F.

During intravascular haemolysis, such as in malaria and haemoglobinopathies(1), haemoglobin is released into the plasma, where it is captured by the protective acute-phase protein haptoglobin. This leads to formation of the haptoglobin-haemoglobin complex, which represents a virtually irreversible non-covalent protein-protein interaction(2). Here we present the crystal structure of the dimeric porcine haptoglobin-haemoglobin complex determined at 2.9 angstrom resolution. This structure reveals that haptoglobin molecules dimerize through an unexpected beta-strand swap between two complement control protein (CCP) domains, defining a new fusion CCP domain structure. The haptoglobin serine protease domain forms extensive interactions with both the alpha- and beta-subunits of haemoglobin, explaining the tight binding between haptoglobin and haemoglobin. The haemoglobin-interacting region in the alpha beta dimer is highly overlapping with the interface between the two alpha beta dimers that constitute the native haemoglobin tetramer. Several haemoglobin residues prone to oxidative modification after exposure to haem-induced reactive oxygen species are buried in the haptoglobin-haemoglobin interface, thus showing a direct protective role of haptoglobin. The haptoglobin loop previously shown to be essential for binding of haptoglobin-haemoglobin to the macrophage scavenger receptor CD163 (ref. 3) protrudes from the surface of the distal end of the complex, adjacent to the associated haemoglobin alpha-subunit. Small-angle X-ray scattering measurements of human haptoglobin-haemoglobin bound to the ligand-binding fragment of CD163 confirm receptor binding in this area, and show that the rigid dimeric complex can bind two receptors. Such receptor cross-linkage may facilitate scavenging and explain the increased functional affinity of multimeric haptoglobin-haemoglobin for CD163 (ref. 4).","[Andersen, Christian Brix Folsted; Torvund-Jensen, Morten; Nielsen, Marianne Jensby; Moestrup, Soren Kragh] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biomed, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Pinto de Oliveira, Cristiano Luis] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Phys, BR-0531497 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Pinto de Oliveira, Cristiano Luis; Pedersen, Jan Skov] Aarhus Univ, Dept Chem, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Pinto de Oliveira, Cristiano Luis; Pedersen, Jan Skov] Aarhus Univ, INANO Interdisciplinary Nanosci Ctr, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Hersleth, Hans-Petter] Univ Oslo, Dept Mol Biosci, NO-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Andersen, Niels Hojmark] Univ Oslo, Dept Chem, NO-0315 Oslo, Norway; [Andersen, Gregers Rom] Aarhus Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark","Andersen, CBF (reprint author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Biomed, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",cbfa@biokemi.au.dk; skm@biokemi.au.dk,"Fluidos Complexos, INCT/H-9172-2013; Oliveira, Cristiano/B-4403-2008; Moestrup, Soren Kragh/A-1403-2014; Pedersen, Jan/A-8346-2008; Nielsen, Marina/F-5625-2012; Institute of Physics, USP/H-5191-2017","Oliveira, Cristiano/0000-0002-3426-6507; Moestrup, Soren Kragh/0000-0003-3862-2107; Pedersen, Jan/0000-0002-7768-0206; Hersleth, Hans-Petter/0000-0002-1142-9983; Andersen, Gregers Rom/0000-0001-6292-3319",Lundbeck Foundation; Novo Nordisk Foundation; Research Council of Norway; European Research Council; Danish Council for Independent Research,"We are grateful to G.

Here we probe the cellular heterogeneity within the IFE using two different inducible Cre recombinase-oestrogen receptor constructs targeting IFE progenitors in mice. Quantitative analysis of clonal fate data and proliferation dynamics demonstrate the existence of two distinct proliferative cell compartments arranged in a hierarchy involving slow-cycling stem cells and committed progenitor cells.

Historically, experimental paradigms that limit reproductive investment result in lifespan extension. We proposed that germline-deficient animals might exhibit heightened protection from proteotoxic stressors in somatic tissues. We find that the forced re-investment of resources from the germ line to the soma in Caenorhabditis elegans results in elevated somatic proteasome activity, clearance of damaged proteins and increased longevity. This activity is associated with increased expression of rpn-6, a subunit of the 19S proteasome, by the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16. Ectopic expression of rpn-6 is sufficient to confer proteotoxic stress resistance and extend lifespan, indicating that rpn-6 is a candidate to correct deficiencies in age-related protein homeostasis disorders.","[Vilchez, David; Morantte, Ianessa; Liu, Zheng; Douglas, Peter M.; Merkwirth, Carsten; Dillin, Andrew] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Glenn Ctr Aging Res, Mol & Cell Biol Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Rodrigues, Ana P.

The distribution of single qubits over large distances via quantum teleportation(5) is a key ingredient for realizing such a global platform. By using quantum teleportation, unknown quantum states can be transferred over arbitrary distances to a party whose location is unknown. Since the first experimental demonstrations of quantum teleportation of independent external qubits(6), an internal qubit(7) and squeezed states(8), researchers have progressively extended the communication distance. Usually this occurs without active feed-forward of the classical Bell-state measurement result, which is an essential ingredient in future applications such as communication between quantum computers. The benchmark for a global quantum internet is quantum teleportation of independent qubits over a free-space link whose attenuation corresponds to the path between a satellite and a ground station. Here we report such an experiment, using active feed-forward in real time. The experiment uses two free-space optical links, quantum and classical, over 143 kilometres between the two Canary Islands of La Palma and Tenerife. To achieve this, we combine advanced techniques involving a frequency-uncorrelated polarization-entangled photon pair source, ultra-low-noise single-photon detectors and entanglement-assisted clock synchronization. The average teleported state fidelity is well beyond the classical limit(9) of two-thirds. Furthermore, we confirm the quality of the quantum teleportation procedure without feed-forward by complete quantum process tomography. Our experiment verifies the maturity and applicability of such technologies in real-world scenarios, in particular for future satellite-based quantum teleportation.","[Ma, Xiao-Song; Herbst, Thomas; Scheidl, Thomas; Wang, Daqing; Kropatschek, Sebastian; Naylor, William; Wittmann, Bernhard; Mech, Alexandra; Kofler, Johannes; Jennewein, Thomas; Ursin, Rupert; Zeilinger, Anton] Austrian Acad Sci, Inst Quantum Opt & Quantum Informat IQOQI, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Ma, Xiao-Song; Herbst, Thomas; Wittmann, Bernhard; Mech, Alexandra; Zeilinger, Anton] Univ Vienna, Fac Phys, Vienna Ctr Quantum Sci & Technol, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Kofler, Johannes] Max Planck Inst Quantum Opt, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Anisimova, Elena; Makarov, Vadim; Jennewein, Thomas] Univ Waterloo, Inst Quantum Comp, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Anisimova, Elena; Makarov, Vadim; Jennewein, Thomas] Univ Waterloo, Dept Phys & Astron, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada","Ma, XS (reprint author), Yale Univ, Dept Elect Engn, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",Xiaosong.Ma@Univie.ac.at; Anton.Zeilinger@Univie.ac.at,"Ursin, Rupert/E-9548-2012; Ma, Xiaosong/A-6824-2011","Ursin, Rupert/0000-0002-9403-269X; ",EU project MALICIA; Research Council of Norway [180439/V30]; Industry Canada; European Space Agency [4000104180/11/NL/AF]; Austrian Science Foundation (FWF) [SFB F4008]; CoQuS; FFG for the QTS project within the ASAP 7 program [828316]; European Commission; Q-ESSENCE [248095]; John Templeton Foundation,"We thank the staff of IAC: F.

Such films are stable only when the hot surface is above a critical temperature, and are a central phenomenon in boiling(2). In this so-called Leidenfrost regime, the low thermal conductivity of the vapour layer inhibits heat transfer between the hot surface and the liquid. When the temperature of the cooling surface drops below the critical temperature, the vapour film collapses and the system enters a nucleate-boiling regime, which can result in vapour explosions that are particularly detrimental in certain contexts, such as in nuclear power plants(3). The presence of these vapour films can also reduce liquid-solid drag(4-6). Here we show how vapour film collapse can be completely suppressed at textured superhydrophobic surfaces. At a smooth hydrophobic surface, the vapour film still collapses on cooling, albeit at a reduced critical temperature, and the system switches explosively to nucleate boiling. In contrast, at textured, superhydrophobic surfaces, the vapour layer gradually relaxes until the surface is completely cooled, without exhibiting a nucleate-boiling phase. This result demonstrates that topological texture on superhydrophobic materials is critical in stabilizing the vapour layer and thus in controlling-by heat transfer-the liquid-gas phase transition at hot surfaces. This concept can potentially be applied to control other phase transitions, such as ice or frost formation(7-9), and to the design of low-drag surfaces at which the vapour phase is stabilized in the grooves of textures without heating(10).","[Vakarelski, Ivan U.; Marston, Jeremy O.; Thoroddsen, Sigurdur T.] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol KAUST, Div Phys Sci & Engn, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia; [Vakarelski, Ivan U.; Thoroddsen, Sigurdur T.] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol KAUST, Clean Combust Res Ctr, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia; [Patankar, Neelesh A.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Chan, Derek Y.

Their biological activities and their complex molecular architectures have made prostaglandins popular targets for synthetic organic chemists for over 40 years(3,4). Prostaglandin analogues are widely used as pharmaceuticals and some, such as latanoprost, which is used to treat glaucoma(5,6), have become billion-dollar drugs. Previously reported syntheses of these compounds are quite lengthy, and every chemical step costs time and energy, generates waste and is accompanied by material losses. Using a new bond disconnection, here we report a concise synthesis of the most complex prostaglandin, PGF(2 alpha), with high levels of control of relative and absolute stereochemistry, and fewer steps. The key step is an aldol cascade reaction of succinaldehyde using proline organocatalysis to create a bicyclic enal in one step and an enantiomeric excess of 98%. This intermediate bicyclic enal is fully primed with the appropriate functionality for attachment of the remaining groups(7). Access to this bicyclic enal will not only render existing prostaglandin-based drugs more affordable, but will also facilitate the rapid exploration of related chemical structures around the ubiquitous five-membered ring motif, such as potentially therapeutic prostaglandin analogues.","[Coulthard, Graeme; Erb, William; Aggarwal, Varinder K.] Univ Bristol, Sch Chem, Bristol BS8 1TS, Avon, England","Aggarwal, VK (reprint author), Univ Bristol, Sch Chem, Cantocks Close, Bristol BS8 1TS, Avon, England.",v.aggarwal@bristol.ac.uk,,"Erb, William/0000-0002-2906-2091",EPSRC; European Research Council [246785]; Royal Society,"We thank EPSRC and the European Research Council (FP7/2007-2013, ERC grant no. 246785) for financial support.

When forests are replaced by pasture or crops, evapotranspiration of moisture from soil and vegetation is often diminished, leading to reduced atmospheric humidity and potentially suppressing precipitation(2,3). Climate models predict that large-scale tropical deforestation causes reduced regional precipitation(4-10), although the magnitude of the effect is model(9,11) and resolution(8) dependent. In contrast, observational studies have linked deforestation to increased precipitation locally(12-14) but have been unable to explore the impact of large-scale deforestation. Here we use satellite remote-sensing data of tropical precipitation and vegetation, combined with simulated atmospheric transport patterns, to assess the pan-tropical effect of forests on tropical rainfall. We find that for more than 60 per cent of the tropical land surface (latitudes 30 degrees south to 30 degrees north), air that has passed over extensive vegetation in the preceding few days produces at least twice as much rain as air that has passed over little vegetation. We demonstrate that this empirical correlation is consistent with evapotranspiration maintaining atmospheric moisture in air that passes over extensive vegetation. We combine these empirical relationships with current trends of Amazonian deforestation to estimate reductions of 12 and 21 per cent in wet-season and dry-season precipitation respectively across the Amazon basin by 2050, due to less-efficient moisture recycling. Our observation-based results complement similar estimates from climate models(4-10), in which the physical mechanisms and feedbacks at work could be explored in more detail.","[Spracklen, D.

The direct impact of this technique on fish populations(1,2) and benthic communities(3,4) has received much attention, but trawling can also modify the physical properties of seafloor sediments, water-sediment chemical exchanges and sediment fluxes(5,6). Most of the studies addressing the physical disturbances of trawl gear on the seabed have been undertaken in coastal and shelf environments(7,8), however, where the capacity of trawling to modify the seafloor morphology coexists with high-energy natural processes driving sediment erosion, transport and deposition(9). Here we show that on upper continental slopes, the reworking of the deep sea floor by trawling gradually modifies the shape of the submarine landscape over large spatial scales. We found that trawling-induced sediment displacement and removal from fishing grounds causes the morphology of the deep sea floor to become smoother over time, reducing its original complexity as shown by high-resolution seafloor relief maps. Our results suggest that in recent decades, following the industrialization of fishing fleets, bottom trawling has become an important driver of deep seascape evolution. Given the global dimension of this type of fishery, we anticipate that the morphology of the upper continental slope in many parts of the world's oceans could be altered by intensive bottom trawling, producing comparable effects on the deep sea floor to those generated by agricultural ploughing on land.","[Puig, Pere; Company, Joan B.; Martin, Jacobo; Palanques, Albert] CSIC, Inst Marine Sci, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain; [Canals, Miquel; Amblas, David; Lastras, Galderic; Calafat, Antoni M.] Univ Barcelona, CRG Marine Geosci, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain","Puig, P (reprint author), CSIC, Inst Marine Sci, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain.",ppuig@icm.csic.es,"Palanques, Albert/C-2661-2013; Calafat, Antoni/J-5848-2017; Amblas, David/A-5482-2015; Lastras, Galderic/A-6487-2013; Puig, Pere/E-5422-2013; Canals, Miquel /F-4922-2013; Company, Joan B./K-7274-2014","Calafat, Antoni/0000-0001-7927-3105; Amblas, David/0000-0002-6248-5512; Lastras, Galderic/0000-0002-8756-3855; Puig, Pere/0000-0001-6189-5504; Canals, Miquel /0000-0001-5267-7601; Company, Joan B./0000-0002-5878-7155","HERMIONE [226354, CTM2010-11084-E]; DOS MARES [CTM2010-21810-C03]; OASIS DEL MAR-Obra Social ""la Caixa""; GRACCIE-CONSOLIDER [CSD2007-00067]; REDECO [CTM2008-04973-E]; Catalan Government Grups de Recerca Consolidats grants [SGR 899, 1305]; Spanish General Secretariat of Maritime Fishing (SEGEMAR); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas; European Social Fund","This work was supported by various research projects: HERMIONE (226354 and CTM2010-11084-E), DOS MARES (CTM2010-21810-C03), OASIS DEL MAR-Obra Social ""la Caixa"", GRACCIE-CONSOLIDER (CSD2007-00067) and REDECO (CTM2008-04973-E).

With deforestation advancing quickly, protected areas are increasingly becoming final refuges for threatened species and natural ecosystem processes. However, many protected areas in the tropics are themselves vulnerable to human encroachment and other environmental stresses(4-9). As pressures mount, it is vital to know whether existing reserves can sustain their biodiversity. A critical constraint in addressing this question has been that data describing a broad array of biodiversity groups have been unavailable for a sufficiently large and representative sample of reserves. Here we present a uniquely comprehensive data set on changes over the past 20 to 30 years in 31 functional groups of species and 21 potential drivers of environmental change, for 60 protected areas stratified across the world's major tropical regions. Our analysis reveals great variation in reserve 'health': about half of all reserves have been effective or performed passably, but the rest are experiencing an erosion of biodiversity that is often alarmingly widespread taxonomically and functionally. Habitat disruption, hunting and forest-product exploitation were the strongest predictors of declining reserve health. Crucially, environmental changes immediately outside reserves seemed nearly as important as those inside in determining their ecological fate, with changes inside reserves strongly mirroring those occurring around them. These findings suggest that tropical protected areas are often intimately linked ecologically to their surrounding habitats, and that a failure to stem broad-scale loss and degradation of such habitats could sharply increase the likelihood of serious biodiversity declines.","[Laurance, William F.; Sloan, Sean P.; Laurance, Susan G.; Campbell, Mason; Edwards, David; Edwards, Felicity; Logsdon, Willis; Roetgers, Christiane] James Cook Univ, Ctr Trop Environm & Sustainabil Sci TESS, Cairns, Qld 4878, Australia; [Laurance, William F.; Sloan, Sean P.; Laurance, Susan G.; Campbell, Mason; Edwards, David; Edwards, Felicity; Logsdon, Willis; Roetgers, Christiane] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Cairns, Qld 4878, Australia; [Laurance, William F.; Useche, D.

Here we report results from a randomized controlled trial of political mobilization messages delivered to 61 million Facebook users during the 2010 US congressional elections. The results show that the messages directly influenced political self-expression, information seeking and real-world voting behaviour of millions of people. Furthermore, the messages not only influenced the users who received them but also the users' friends, and friends of friends. The effect of social transmission on real-world voting was greater than the direct effect of the messages themselves, and nearly all the transmission occurred between 'close friends' who were more likely to have a face-to-face relationship. These results suggest that strong ties are instrumental for spreading both online and real-world behaviour in human social networks.","[Bond, Robert M.; Fariss, Christopher J.; Settle, Jaime E.; Fowler, James H.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Polit Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Jones, Jason J.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Psychol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Kramer, Adamd.

L1 input is thought to provide 'contextual' information(3), but the signals transmitted by L1 feedback remain uncharacterized. In the rodent somatosensory system, the spatially diffuse(4) feedback projection from vibrissal motor cortex (vM1) to vibrissal somatosensory cortex (vS1, also known as the barrel cortex) may allow whisker touch to be interpreted in the context of whisker position to compute object location(5,6). When mice palpate objects with their whiskers to localize object features(7,8), whisker touch excites vS1(9) and later vM1 in a somatotopic manner(10-13). Here we use axonal calcium imaging to track activity in vM1 -> vS1 afferents in L1 of the barrel cortex while mice performed whisker-dependent object localization. Spatially intermingled individual axons represent whisker movements, touch and other behavioural features. In a subpopulation of axons, activity depends on object location and persists for seconds after touch. Neurons in the barrel cortex thus have information to integrate movements and touches of multiple whiskers over time, key components of object identification and navigation by active touch.","[Petreanu, Leopoldo; Gutnisky, Diego A.; Huber, Daniel; Xu, Ning-long; O'Connor, Dan H.; Tian, Lin; Looger, Loren; Svoboda, Karel] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA","Svoboda, K (reprint author), Howard Hughes Med Inst, Janelia Farm Res Campus, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA.",svobodak@janelia.hhmi.org,"Gutnisky, Diego/E-3846-2012; Huber, Daniel/C-2932-2013","Gutnisky, Diego/0000-0002-8578-0039; Xu, Ninglong/0000-0002-1651-401X; Petreanu, Leopoldo/0000-0003-1434-4691; Tian, Lin/0000-0001-7012-6926",Howard Hughes Medical Institute,,,41,118,118,1,40,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,13-Sep,2012,489,7415,,,,,299,+,,10.1038/nature11321,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,003UC,WOS:000308635900043,22922646.0,No,,,11/20/17,karel,svoboda,male,0.92,90,HTuwJ_EAAAAJ,40666

Although genome stability is essential for the survival of stem cells, proteome stability may have an equally important role in stem-cell identity and function. Furthermore, with the asymmetric divisions invoked by stem cells, the passage of damaged proteins to daughter cells could potentially destroy the resulting lineage of cells. Therefore, a firm understanding of how stem cells maintain their proteome is of central importance. Here we show that human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) exhibit high proteasome activity that is correlated with increased levels of the 19S proteasome subunit PSMD11 (known as RPN-6 in Caenorhabditis elegans)(3-5) and a corresponding increased assembly of the 26S/30S proteasome. Ectopic expression of PSMD11 is sufficient to increase proteasome assembly and activity. FOXO4, an insulin/insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) responsive transcription factor associated with long lifespan in invertebrates(6,7), regulates proteasome activity by modulating the expression of PSMD11 in hESCs. Proteasome inhibition in hESCs affects the expression of pluripotency markers and the levels of specific markers of the distinct germ layers. Our results suggest a new regulation of proteostasis in hESCs that links longevity and stress resistance in invertebrates to hESC function and identity.","[Vilchez, David; Morantte, Ianessa; Merkwirth, Carsten; Joyce, Derek; Dillin, Andrew] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Glenn Ctr Aging Res, Mol & Cell Biol Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Boyer, Leah; Gage, Fred H.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Genet Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Lutz, Margaret; Berggren, W.

The presence of stereotyped and quasi-identical BCRs in different CLL patients suggests that recognition of specific antigens might drive CLL pathogenesis. Here we show that, in contrast to other B-cell neoplasias, CLL-derived BCRs induce antigen-independent cell-autonomous signalling, which is dependent on the heavy-chain complementarity-determining region (HCDR3) and an internal epitope of the BCR. Indeed, transferring the HCDR3 of a CLL-derived BCR provides autonomous signalling capacity to a non-autonomously active BCR, whereas mutations in the internal epitope abolish this capacity. Because BCR expression was required for the binding of secreted CLL-derived BCRs to target cells, and mutations in the internal epitope reduced this binding, our results indicate a new model for CLL pathogenesis, with cell-autonomous antigen-independent signalling as a crucial pathogenic mechanism.","[Duehren-von Minden, Marcus; Uebelhart, Rudolf; Schneider, Dunja; Wossning, Thomas; Bach, Martina P.; Hofmann, Daniel; Surova, Elena; Koehler, Fabian; Jumaa, Hassan] Univ Freiburg, Ctr Biol Signaling Studies BIOSS, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Uebelhart, Rudolf; Surova, Elena] Univ Freiburg, Spemann Grad Sch Biol & Med, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Buchner, Maike; Follo, Marie; Zirlik, Katja] Univ Med Ctr Freiburg, Dept Hematol Oncol, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [Wardemann, Hedda] Max Planck Inst Infect Biol, Max Planck Res Grp Mol Immunol, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Veelken, Hendrik] Leiden Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Hematol, NL-2333 ZA Leiden, Netherlands; [Jumaa, Hassan] Univ Freiburg, Fac Biol, Dept Mol Immunol, D-79108 Freiburg, Germany; [Jumaa, Hassan] Max Planck Inst Immunobiol & Epigenet, D-79108 Freiburg, Germany","Jumaa, H (reprint author), Univ Freiburg, Ctr Biol Signaling Studies BIOSS, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany.",jumaa@immunbio.mpg.de,,"Veelken, Hendrik/0000-0002-9108-3125; Follo, Marie/0000-0002-3090-7442","Deutsche Krebshilfe [108935]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB746, JU463/2-1]; Excellence Initiative of the German Federal and State Governments [GSC-4]","We thank C.

In humans, the multisubunit complex cohesin is made up of SMC1, SMC3, RAD21 and a STAG protein. These form a ring structure that is proposed to encircle sister chromatids to mediate sister chromatid cohesion(8) and also has key roles in gene regulation(9). SMC3 is acetylated during S-phase to establish cohesiveness of chromatin-loaded cohesin(10-13), and in yeast, the class I histone deacetylase Hos1 deacetylates SMC3 during anaphase(14-16). Here we identify HDAC8 as the vertebrate SMC3 deacetylase, as well as loss-of-function HDAC8 mutations in six CdLS probands. Loss of HDAC8 activity results in increased SMC3 acetylation and inefficient dissolution of the 'used' cohesin complex released from chromatin in both prophase and anaphase. SMC3 with retained acetylation is loaded onto chromatin, and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analysis demonstrates decreased occupancy of cohesin localization sites that results in a consistent pattern of altered transcription seen in CdLS cell lines with either NIPBL or HDAC8 mutations.","[Deardorff, Matthew A.; Clark, Dinah; Ernst, Sarah; Francey, Lauren J.; Hullings, Melanie; Kaur, Maninder; Wilde, Jonathan J.; Jackson, Laird G.; Krantz, Ian D.] Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Div Human Genet & Mol Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Deardorff, Matthew A.; Krantz, Ian D.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Bando, Masashige; Nakato, Ryuichiro; Minamino, Masashi; Saitoh, Katsuya; Komata, Makiko; Katou, Yuki; Shirahige, Katsuhiko] Univ Tokyo, Inst Mol & Cellular Biosci, Res Ctr Epigenet Dis, Tokyo 1130032, Japan; [Watrin, Erwan; Jaulin, Christian; Magnaghi-Jaulin, Laura; Prigent, Claude] Fac Med, Ctr Natl Rech Sci CNRS, Res Inst Genet & Dev IGDR, F-35043 Rennes, France; [Itoh, Takehiko] Tokyo Inst Technol, Sch & Grad Sch Biosci & Biotechnol, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2268503, Japan; [Cole, Kathryn E.; Decroos, Christophe; Lombardi, Patrick M.; Christianson, David W.] Univ Penn, Dept Chem, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [De Baere, Elfride] Ghent Univ Hosp, Ctr Med Genet, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Di Donato, Nataliya] Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Klin Genet, D-01307 Dresden, Germany; [Gyftodimou, Yolanda; Petersen, Michael B.] Inst Child Hlth, Dept Genet, Athens 11527, Greece; [Hirashima, Kyotaro; Seimiya, Hiroyuki] Japanese Fdn Canc Res, Div Mol Biotherapy, Tokyo 1358550, Japan; [Ishikawa, Yuuichi] Japanese Fdn Canc Res, Dept Pathol, Tokyo 1358550, Japan; [Kiyono, Tohru] Natl Canc Ctr, Res Inst, Div Virol, Tokyo 1040045, Japan; [Mortier, Geert R.] Univ Antwerp Hosp, Dept Med Genet, B-2650 Antwerp, Belgium; [Mortier, Geert R.] Univ Antwerp, B-2650 Antwerp, Belgium; [Nozaki, Naohito] Tokyo Inst Technol, Biofrontier Res Ctr, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2268503, Japan; [Petersen, Michael B.] Aarhus Univ Hosp, Aalborg Hosp, Dept Clin Genet, DK-9100 Aalborg, Denmark; [Siu, Victoria M.] Univ Western Ontario, London, ON N6A 5W9, Canada; [Suzuki, Yutaka; Hirota, Toru] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Tokyo 2778561, Japan; [Willems, Patrick J.] GENDIA, B-2020 Antwerp, Belgium; [Gillessen-Kaesbach, Gabriele; Kaiser, Frank J.] Med Univ Lubeck, Inst Humangenet Lubeck, D-23538 Lubeck, Germany; [Jackson, Laird G.] Drexel Univ, Sch Med, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Philadelphia, PA 19102 USA; [Shirahige, Katsuhiko] JST, CREST, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1020076, Japan","Deardorff, MA (reprint author), Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Div Human Genet & Mol Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",deardorff@email.chop.edu; ian2@mail.med.upenn.edu; kshirahi@iam.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"; Itoh, Takehiko/E-8873-2014; Petersen, Michael Bjorn/D-1483-2017; Mortier, Geert/D-2542-2012","Nakato, Ryuichiro/0000-0003-3019-5817; Seimiya, Hiroyuki/0000-0003-3314-9736; Itoh, Takehiko/0000-0002-6113-557X; Petersen, Michael Bjorn/0000-0003-0316-8207; Mortier, Geert/0000-0001-9871-4578; Francey, Lauren J/0000-0002-9700-2277","US and International Cornelia de Lange Syndrome Foundations; National Institutes of Health [K08HD055488, GM49758, P01 HD052860]; US CdLS Foundation; Children's Hospital of Philadelphia; University of Lubeck (Schwerpunktprogramm, Medizinische Genetik: Von seltenen Varianten zur Krankheitsentstehung); Research Program of Innovative Cell Biology by Innovative Technology; MEXT","We are grateful to the individuals and families with Cornelia de Lange syndrome who participated in this study, as well as to the referring physicians and colleagues who have contributed samples and clinical information.

CR is frequently used as a tool to understand mechanisms behind ageing and age-associated diseases. In addition to and independently of increasing lifespan, CR has been reported to delay or prevent the occurrence of many chronic diseases in a variety of animals. Beneficial effects of CR on outcomes such as immune function(1,2), motor coordination(3) and resistance to sarcopenia(4) in rhesus monkeys have recently been reported. We report here that a CR regimen implemented in young and older age rhesus monkeys at the National Institute on Aging (NIA) has not improved survival outcomes. Our findings contrast with an ongoing study at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center (WNPRC), which reported improved survival associated with 30% CR initiated in adult rhesus monkeys (7-14 years)(5) and a preliminary report with a small number of CR monkeys(6). Over the years, both NIA and WNPRC have extensively documented beneficial health effects of CR in these two apparently parallel studies. The implications of the WNPRC findings were important as they extended CR findings beyond the laboratory rodent and to a long-lived primate. Our study suggests a separation between health effects, morbidity andmortality, and similar to what has been shown in rodents(7-9), study design, husbandry and diet composition may strongly affect the life-prolonging effect of CR in a long-lived nonhuman primate.","[Mattison, Julie A.; Tilmont, Edward M.; Handy, April M.; Young, Jennifer E.] NIA, Lab Expt Gerontol, NIH, Anim Ctr, Dickerson, MD 20842 USA; [Roth, George S.] GeroScience, Pylesville, MD 21132 USA; [Beasley, T.

First, the risk of arrhythmias following hESC-CM transplantation in injured hearts has not been determined. Second, the electromechanical integration of hESC-CMs in injured hearts has not been demonstrated, so it is unclear whether these cells improve contractile function directly through addition of new force-generating units. Here we use a guinea-pig model to show that hESC-CM grafts in injured hearts protect against arrhythmias and can contract synchronously with host muscle. Injured hearts with hESC-CM grafts show improved mechanical function and a significantly reduced incidence of both spontaneous and induced ventricular tachycardia. To assess the activity of hESC-CM grafts in vivo, we transplanted hESC-CMs expressing the genetically encoded calcium sensor, GCaMP3 (refs 4, 5). By correlating the GCaMP3 fluorescent signal with the host ECG, we found that grafts in uninjured hearts have consistent 1:1 host-graft coupling. Grafts in injured hearts are more heterogeneous and typically include both coupled and uncoupled regions. Thus, human myocardial grafts meet physiological criteria for true heart regeneration, providing support for the continued development of hESC-based cardiac therapies for both mechanical and electrical repair.","[Shiba, Yuji; Fernandes, Sarah; Zhu, Wei-Zhong; Filice, Dominic; Muskheli, Veronica; Kim, Jonathan; Palpant, Nathan J.; Gantz, Jay; Moyes, Kara White; Reinecke, Hans; Van Biber, Benjamin; Murry, Charles E.; Laflamme, Michael A.] Univ Washington, Dept Pathol, Ctr Cardiovasc Biol, Inst Stem Cell & Regenerat Med, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Shiba, Yuji; Izawa, Atsushi] Shinshu Univ, Dept Cardiovasc Med, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Filice, Dominic; Gantz, Jay; Murry, Charles E.] Univ Washington, Inst Stem Cell & Regenerat Med, Ctr Cardiovasc Biol, Dept Bioengn, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Dardas, Todd; Mignone, John L.; Hanna, Ramy; Viswanathan, Mohan; Murry, Charles E.] Univ Washington, Inst Stem Cell & Regenerat Med, Ctr Cardiovasc Biol, Dept Med & Cardiol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Gold, Joseph D.] Geron Corp, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Kotlikoff, Michael I.] Cornell Univ, Coll Vet Med, Dept Biomed Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Sarvazyan, Narine; Kay, Matthew W.] George Washington Univ, Dept Pharmacol & Physiol, Washington, DC 20037 USA; [Kay, Matthew W.] George Washington Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Washington, DC 20037 USA","Laflamme, MA (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Pathol, Ctr Cardiovasc Biol, Inst Stem Cell & Regenerat Med, 850 Republican St, Seattle, WA 98109 USA.",murry@uw.edu; laflamme@u.washington.edu,"Zhu, Wei-Zhong/G-4919-2011; Palpant, Nathan/B-1641-2017","Palpant, Nathan/0000-0002-9334-8107; Laflamme, Michael/0000-0001-5908-880X","Geron Corporation; US National Institutes of Health [K08-HL80431, R01-HL064387, P01-HL094374, R01-HL084642, P01-GM81619, U01-HL100405, R01-HL095828]; University of Washington's Mouse Metabolic Phenotyping Center [U24-DK076126]","We thank Y.

The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project has systematically mapped regions of transcription, transcription factor association, chromatin structure and histone modification. These data enabled us to assign biochemical functions for 80% of the genome, in particular outside of the well-studied protein-coding regions. Many discovered candidate regulatory elements are physically associated with one another and with expressed genes, providing new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation. The newly identified elements also show a statistical correspondence to sequence variants linked to human disease, and can thereby guide interpretation of this variation. Overall, the project provides new insights into the organization and regulation of our genes and genome, and is an expansive resource of functional annotations for biomedical research.","[Dunham, Ian; Birney, Ewan; Herrero, Javier; Wilder, Steven P.; Keefe, Damian; Brazma, Alvis; Flicek, Paul; Lukk, Margus; Sobral, Daniel] European Bioinformat Inst EMBL EBI, Vertebrate Genom Grp, Hinxton CB10 1SD, Cambs, England; [Kundaje, Anshul; Batzoglou, Serafim; Sidow, Arend; Hussami, Nadine; Kyriazopoulou-Panagiotopoulou, Sofia; Libbrecht, Max W.; Schaub, Marc A.] Stanford Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Aldred, Shelley F.; Collins, Patrick J.; Trinklein, Nathan D.] SwitchGear Genom, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Davis, CarrieA.; Schlesinger, Felix; Gingeras, Thomas R.; Davis, Carrie A.; Dobin, Alex; Lin, Wei; Xue, Chenghai; Zaleski, Chris; Baer, Michael T.; Batut, Philippe; Bell, Kimberly; Chakrabortty, Sudipto; Drenkow, Jorg; Fastuca, Megan; Fejes-Toth, Kata; Gordon, Assaf; Jha, Sonali; Preall, Jonathan B.; Presaud, Kimberly; See, Lei-Hoon; Wang, Huaien; Hannon, Gregory J.; Frankish, Adam; Ebersol, Abigail K.] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; [Doyle, Francis; Bernstein, Bradley E.; Tenenbaum, Scott A.] SUNY Albany, Albany, NY 12203 USA; [Epstein, Charles B.; Shoresh, Noam; Bernstein, Bradley E.; Mikkelsen, Tarjei S.; Zhang, Xiaolan; Wang, Li; Issner, Robbyn; Coyne, Michael J.; Durham, Timothy; Truong, Thanh; Loveland, Jane] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Frietze, Seth; Farnham, Peggy J.; Witt, Heather] USC Norris Comprehens Canc Ctr, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Harrow, Jennifer; Hubbard, Timothy J.; Kokocinski, Felix; Aken, Bronwen; Barrell, Daniel; Barson, Gemma; Berry, Andrew; Bignell, Alexandra; Boychenko, Veronika; Davidson, Claire; Despacio-Reyes, Gloria; Frankish, Adam; Gilbert, James; Gonzalez, Jose Manuel; Griffiths, Ed; Hunt, Toby; Kay, Mike; Manthravadi, Deepa; Mudge, Jonathan; Mukherjee, Gaurab; Saunders, Gary; Searle, Stephen; Snow, Catherine; Steward, Charlie; Tapanari, Electra; Wilming, Laurens; Zadissa, Amonida] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Hinxton CB10 1SA, Cambs, England; [Kaul, Rajinder] Univ Washington, Dept Med, Div Med Genet, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Khatun, Jainab; Giddings, Morgan C.; Wrobel, John; Risk, Brian A.] Boise State Univ, Coll Arts & Sci, Boise, ID 83725 USA; [Lajoie, Bryan R.; Sanyal, Amartya; Dekker, Job; Jain, Gaurav] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Program Syst Biol, Program Gene Funct & Express,Dept Biochem & Mol P, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Landt, Stephen G.; Snyder, Michael; Addleman, Nick; Bettinger, Keith; Boyle, Alan P.; Cayting, Philip; Cheng, Yong; Eastman, Catharine; Euskirchen, Ghia; Grubert, Fabian; Hariharan, Manoj; Karczewski, Konrad J.; Kasowski, Maya; Lacroute, Phil; Lam, Hugo; Ouyang, Zhengqing; Patacsil, Dorrelyn; Ramirez, Lucia; Shi, Minyi; Slifer, Teri; Wu, Linfeng; Yang, Xinqiong; Ebersol, Abigail K.] Stanford Univ, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lee, Bum-Kyu; Battenhouse, Anna; Bhinge, Akshay A.; Liu, Zheng; McDaniell, Ryan M.; Ni, Yunyun; Adar, Sheera; Zhang, Zhancheng; Wang, Tianyuan; Iyer, Vishwanath R.] Univ Texas Austin, Ctr Syst & Synthet Biol, Inst Cellular & Mol Biol, Sect Mol Genet & Microbiol, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Pauli, Florencia; Reddy, Timothy E.; Gunter, Chris; Myers, Richard M.; Gertz, Jason; Partridge, E.

Here we present the first extensive map of human DHSs identified through genome-wide profiling in 125 diverse cell and tissue types. We identify similar to 2.9 million DHSs that encompass virtually all known experimentally validated cis-regulatory sequences and expose a vast trove of novel elements, most with highly cell-selective regulation. Annotating these elements using ENCODE data reveals novel relationships between chromatin accessibility, transcription, DNA methylation and regulatory factor occupancy patterns. We connect similar to 580,000 distal DHSs with their target promoters, revealing systematic pairing of different classes of distal DHSs and specific promoter types. Patterning of chromatin accessibility at many regulatory regions is organized with dozens to hundreds of co-activated elements, and the transcellular DNase I sensitivity pattern at a given region can predict cell-type-specific functional behaviours. The DHS landscape shows signatures of recent functional evolutionary constraint. However, the DHS compartment in pluripotent and immortalized cells exhibits higher mutation rates than that in highly differentiated cells, exposing an unexpected link between chromatin accessibility, proliferative potential and patterns of human variation.","[Thurman, Robert E.; Rynes, Eric; Humbert, Richard; Vierstra, Jeff; Maurano, Matthew T.; Haugen, Eric; Stergachis, Andrew B.; Wang, Hao; Vernot, Benjamin; John, Sam; Sandstrom, Richard; Bates, Daniel; Canfield, Theresa K.; Diegel, Morgan; Dunn, Douglas; Giste, Erika; Johnson, Audra K.; Kutyavin, Tanya; Lee, Kristen; Neph, Shane; Neri, Fidencio; Qu, Hongzhu; Reynolds, Alex P.; Roach, Vaughn; Shafer, Anthony; Vong, Shinny; Weaver, Molly; Akey, Joshua M.; Sabo, Peter J.; Stamatoyannopoulos, John A.] Univ Washington, Dept Genome Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Sheffield, Nathan C.; London, Darin; Safi, Alexias; Song, Lingyun; Crawford, Gregory E.] Duke Univ, Inst Genome Sci & Policy, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Garg, Kavita; Tewari, Muneesh] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Div Human Biol, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Boatman, Lisa; Ebersol, Abigail K.; Frum, Tristan; Johnson, Ericka M.; Lotakis, Dimitra; Nguyen, Eric D.; Sanchez, Minerva E.; Yan, Yongqi; Hansen, R.

Using genomic DNase I footprinting across 41 diverse cell and tissue types, we detected 45 million transcription factor occupancy events within regulatory regions, representing differential binding to 8.4 million distinct short sequence elements. Here we show that this small genomic sequence compartment, roughly twice the size of the exome, encodes an expansive repertoire of conserved recognition sequences for DNA-binding proteins that nearly doubles the size of the human cis-regulatory lexicon. We find that genetic variants affecting allelic chromatin states are concentrated in footprints, and that these elements are preferentially sheltered from DNA methylation. High-resolution DNase I cleavage patterns mirror nucleotide-level evolutionary conservation and track the crystallographic topography of protein-DNA interfaces, indicating that transcription factor structure has been evolutionarily imprinted on the human genome sequence. We identify a stereotyped 50-base-pair footprint that precisely defines the site of transcript origination within thousands of human promoters. Finally, we describe a large collection of novel regulatory factor recognition motifs that are highly conserved in both sequence and function, and exhibit cell-selective occupancy patterns that closely parallel major regulators of development, differentiation and pluripotency.","[Neph, Shane; Vierstra, Jeff; Stergachis, Andrew B.; Reynolds, Alex P.; Haugen, Eric; Vernot, Benjamin; Thurman, Robert E.; John, Sam; Sandstrom, Richard; Johnson, Audra K.; Maurano, Matthew T.; Humbert, Richard; Rynes, Eric; Wang, Hao; Vong, Shinny; Lee, Kristen; Bates, Daniel; Diegel, Morgan; Roach, Vaughn; Dunn, Douglas; Neri, Jun; Schafer, Anthony; Hansen, R.

To examine the principles of the human transcriptional regulatory network, we determined the genomic binding information of 119 transcription-related factors in over 450 distinct experiments. We found the combinatorial, co-association of transcription factors to be highly context specific: distinct combinations of factors bind at specific genomic locations. In particular, there are significant differences in the binding proximal and distal to genes. We organized all the transcription factor binding into a hierarchy and integrated it with other genomic information (for example, microRNA regulation), forming a dense meta-network. Factors at different levels have different properties; for instance, top-level transcription factors more strongly influence expression and middle-level ones co-regulate targets to mitigate information-flow bottlenecks. Moreover, these co-regulations give rise to many enriched network motifs (for example, noise-buffering feed-forward loops). Finally, more connected network components are under stronger selection and exhibit a greater degree of allele-specific activity (that is, differential binding to the two parental alleles). The regulatory information obtained in this study will be crucial for interpreting personal genome sequences and understanding basic principles of human biology and disease.","[Gerstein, Mark B.; Yan, Koon-Kiu; Cheng, Chao; Mu, Xinmeng Jasmine; Khurana, Ekta; Alexander, Roger; Min, Renqiang; Alves, Pedro; Abyzov, Alexej; Bhardwaj, Nitin; Fu, Yao; Harmanci, Arif; Leng, Jing; Wang, Jing; Yip, Kevin Y.; Zilberman-Schapira, Gili] Yale Univ, Program Computat Biol & Bioinformat, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Gerstein, Mark B.; Yan, Koon-Kiu; Cheng, Chao; Khurana, Ekta; Rozowsky, Joel; Alexander, Roger; Min, Renqiang; Abyzov, Alexej; Bhardwaj, Nitin; Harmanci, Arif; Yip, Kevin Y.] Yale Univ, Dept Mol Biophys & Biochem, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Gerstein, Mark B.; Chen, David Z.] Yale Univ, Dept Commun Sci, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Kundaje, Anshul; Batzoglou, Serafim] Stanford Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Hariharan, Manoj; Landt, Stephen G.; Addleman, Nick; Boyle, Alan P.; Cayting, Philip; Cheng, Yong; Eastman, Catharine; Euskirchen, Ghia; Grubert, Fabian; Kasowski, Maya; Lacroute, Phil; Ouyang, Zhengqing; Patacsil, Dorrelyn; Ramirez, Lucia; Shi, Minyi; Slifer, Teri; Wu, Linfeng; Yang, Xinqiong; Snyder, Michael] Stanford Univ, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Min, Renqiang] NEC Labs Amer, Dept Machine Learning, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Charos, Alexandra; Monahan, Hannah; Raha, Debasish; Reed, Brian] Yale Univ, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Clarke, Declan] Yale Univ, Dept Chem, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Frietze, Seth; Farnham, Peggy J.] Univ So Calif, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Norris Comprehens Canc Ctr, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Gertz, Jason; Jain, Preti; Partridge, E.

A complete catalogue of these RNAs is not yet available and their characteristic subcellular localizations are also poorly understood. Because RNA represents the direct output of the genetic information encoded by genomes and a significant proportion of a cell's regulatory capabilities are focused on its synthesis, processing, transport, modification and translation, the generation of such a catalogue is crucial for understanding genome function. Here we report evidence that three-quarters of the human genome is capable of being transcribed, as well as observations about the range and levels of expression, localization, processing fates, regulatory regions and modifications of almost all currently annotated and thousands of previously unannotated RNAs. These observations, taken together, prompt a redefinition of the concept of a gene.","[Djebali, Sarah; Merkel, Angelika; Tanzer, Andrea; Lagarde, Julien; Roeder, Maik; Alioto, Tyler; Curado, Joao; Derrien, Thomas;

The principles defining the relationships between these elements and distal target genes remain unknown. Promoters and distal elements can engage in looping interactions that have been implicated in gene regulation(1). Here we have applied chromosome conformation capture carbon copy (5C(2)) to interrogate comprehensively interactions between transcription start sites (TSSs) and distal elements in 1% of the human genome representing the ENCODE pilot project regions(3). 5C maps were generated for GM12878, K562 and HeLa-S3 cells and results were integrated with data from the ENCODE consortium(4). In each cell line we discovered >1,000 long-range interactions between promoters and distal sites that include elements resembling enhancers, promoters and CTCF-bound sites. We observed significant correlations between gene expression, promoter-enhancer interactions and the presence of enhancer RNAs. Long-range interactions show marked asymmetry with a bias for interactions with elements located similar to 120 kilobases upstream of the TSS. Long-range interactions are often not blocked by sites bound by CTCF and cohesin, indicating that many of these sites do not demarcate physically insulated gene domains. Furthermore, only similar to 7% of looping interactions are with the nearest gene, indicating that genomic proximity is not a simple predictor for long-range interactions. Finally, promoters and distal elements are engaged in multiple long-range interactions to form complex networks. Our results start to place genes and regulatory elements in three-dimensional context, revealing their functional relationships.","[Sanyal, Amartya; Lajoie, Bryan R.; Jain, Gaurav; Dekker, Job] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Pharmacol, Program Syst Biol,Program Gene Funct & Express, Worcester, MA 01605 USA","Dekker, J (reprint author), Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Pharmacol, Program Syst Biol,Program Gene Funct & Express, 364 Plantat St, Worcester, MA 01605 USA.",job.dekker@umassmed.edu,"SANYAL, AMARTYA/D-7240-2015","SANYAL, AMARTYA/0000-0002-2109-4478","National Institutes of Health, National Human Genome Research Institute [HG003143, HG003143-06S1]; W.M Keck Foundation","We thank the University of Massachusetts Medical School Deep Sequencing core for sequencing 5C libraries, and R.

To facilitate ubiquitin transfer, RING E3 ligases bind both substrate and a ubiquitin E2 conjugating enzyme linked to ubiquitin via a thioester bond, but the mechanism of transfer has remained elusive. Here we report the crystal structure of the dimeric RING domain of rat RNF4 in complex with E2 (UbcH5A) linked by an isopeptide bond to ubiquitin. While the E2 contacts a single protomer of the RING, ubiquitin is folded back onto the E2 by contacts from both RING protomers. The carboxy-terminal tail of ubiquitin is locked into an active site groove on the E2 by an intricate network of interactions, resulting in changes at the E2 active site. This arrangement is primed for catalysis as it can deprotonate the incoming substrate lysine residue and stabilize the consequent tetrahedral transition-state intermediate.","[Plechanovova, Anna; Jaffray, Ellis G.; Tatham, Michael H.; Hay, Ronald T.] Univ Dundee, Coll Life Sci, Wellcome Trust Ctr Gene Regulat & Express, Dundee DD1 5EH, Scotland; [Naismith, James H.] Univ St Andrews, St Andrews KY16 9ST, Fife, Scotland","Hay, RT (reprint author), Univ Dundee, Coll Life Sci, Wellcome Trust Ctr Gene Regulat & Express, Dundee DD1 5EH, Scotland.",r.t.hay@dundee.ac.uk,"Naismith, James/H-3408-2012; Tatham, Michael/E-9622-2010","Naismith, James/0000-0001-6744-5061; Tatham, Michael/0000-0001-6986-1691; Hay, Ronald/0000-0001-7113-9024",Wellcome Trust; Cancer Research UK; Scottish Funding Council [SULSA],"We thank M.

The predicted(2-4) primordial Li-7 abundance is four times that measured in the atmospheres of Galactic halo stars(5-7). This discrepancy could be caused by modification of surface lithium abundances during the stars' lifetimes(8) or by physics beyond the Standard Model that affects early nucleosynthesis(9,10). The lithium abundance of low-metallicity gas provides an alternative constraint on the primordial abundance and cosmic evolution of lithium(11) that is not susceptible to the in situ modifications that may affect stellar atmospheres. Here we report observations of interstellar Li-7 in the low-metallicity gas of the Small Magellanic Cloud, a nearby galaxy with a quarter the Sun's metallicity. The present-day Li-7 abundance of the Small Magellanic Cloud is nearly equal to the BBN predictions, severely constraining the amount of possible subsequent enrichment of the gas by stellar and cosmic-ray nucleosynthesis. Our measurements can be reconciled with standard BBN with an extremely fine-tuned depletion of stellar Li with metallicity. They are also consistent with non-standard BBN.","[Howk, J.

Voyager 1 was then about 20 astronomical units beyond the shock that terminates the free expansion of the solar wind and was immersed in the heated non-thermal plasma region called the heliosheath. The expectation from contemporary simulations(2,3) was that the heliosheath plasma would be deflected from radial flow to meridional flow (in solar heliospheric coordinates), which at Voyager 1 would lie mainly on the (locally spherical) surface called the heliopause. This surface is supposed to separate the heliosheath plasma, which is of solar origin, from the interstellar plasma, which is of local Galactic origin. In 2011, the Voyager project began occasional temporary re-orientations of the spacecraft (totalling about 10-25 hours every 2 months) to re-align the Low-Energy Charged Particle instrument on board Voyager 1 so that it could measure meridional flow. Here we report that, contrary to expectations, these observations yielded a meridional flow velocity of +3 +/- 11 km s(-1), that is, one consistent with zero within statistical uncertainties.

The high carrier mobility in the amorphous state, and excellent large-area uniformity, have extended their applications to active-matrix electronics, including displays, sensor arrays and X-ray detectors(1-7). Moreover, their solution processability and optical transparency have opened new horizons for low-cost printable and transparent electronics on plastic substrates(8-13). But metal-oxide formation by the sol-gel route requires an annealing step at relatively high temperature(2,14-19), which has prevented the incorporation of these materials with the polymer substrates used in high-performance flexible electronics. Here we report a general method for forming high-performance and operationally stable metal-oxide semiconductors at room temperature, by deep-ultraviolet photochemical activation of sol-gel films. Deep-ultraviolet irradiation induces efficient condensation and densification of oxide semicon-ducting films by photochemical activation at low temperature. This photochemical activation is applicable to numerous metal-oxide semiconductors, and the performance (in terms of transistor mobility and operational stability) of thin-film transistors fabricated by this route compares favourably with that of thin-film transistors based on thermally annealed materials. The field-effect mobilities of the photo-activated metal-oxide semiconductors are as high as 14 and 7 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) (with an Al2O3 gate insulator) on glass and polymer substrates, respectively; and seven-stage ring oscillators fabricated on polymer substrates operate with an oscillation frequency of more than 340 kHz, corresponding to a propagation delay of less than 210 nanoseconds per stage.","[Heo, Jae-Sang; Park, Sung Kyu] Chung Ang Univ, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Seoul 156756, South Korea; [Kim, Yong-Hoon; Kim, Tae-Hyeong; Kim, Jiwan; Oh, Min Suk] Korea Elect Technol Inst, Flexible Display Res Ctr, Songnam 463816, South Korea; [Park, Sungjun; Yoon, Myung-Han] Gwangju Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Kwangju 500712, South Korea; [Yoon, Myung-Han] World Class Univ, Gwangju Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Nanobio Mat & Elect, Kwangju 500712, South Korea; [Yi, Gi-Ra] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Polymer Sci & Engn, Suwon 440746, South Korea; [Noh, Yong-Young] Hanbat Natl Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Taejon 305719, South Korea","Park, SK (reprint author), Chung Ang Univ, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Seoul 156756, South Korea.",skpark@cau.ac.kr,"park, sung kyu/H-5338-2011; Yi, Gi-Ra/E-5592-2010; Noh, Yong-Young/C-7210-2014; Noh, Yong-Young/C-4423-2008","Yi, Gi-Ra/0000-0003-1353-8988; Noh, Yong-Young/0000-0001-7222-2401","Basic Science Research Program [2010-0002623]; World-Class University Program through a National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) [R31-10026]; Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology","We acknowledge discussions with C.-I.

The scope of hydrogel applications, however, is often severely limited by their mechanical behaviour(5). Most hydrogels do not exhibit high stretchability; for example, an alginate hydrogel ruptures when stretched to about 1.2 times its original length. Some synthetic elastic hydrogels(6,7) have achieved stretches in the range 10-20, but these values are markedly reduced in samples containing notches. Most hydrogels are brittle, with fracture energies of about 10 J m(-2) (ref. 8), as compared with similar to 1,000 J m(-2) for cartilage(9) and similar to 10,000 J m(-2) for natural rubbers(10). Intense efforts are devoted to synthesizing hydrogels with improved mechanical properties(11-18); certain synthetic gels have reached fracture energies of 100-1,000 J m(-2) (refs 11, 14, 17). Here we report the synthesis of hydrogels from polymers forming ionically and covalently crosslinked networks. Although such gels contain similar to 90% water, they can be stretched beyond 20 times their initial length, and have fracture energies of similar to 9,000 J m(-2). Even for samples containing notches, a stretch of 17 is demonstrated. We attribute the gels' toughness to the synergy of two mechanisms: crack bridging by the network of covalent crosslinks, and hysteresis by unzipping the network of ionic crosslinks. Furthermore, the network of covalent crosslinks preserves the memory of the initial state, so that much of the large deformation is removed on unloading. The unzipped ionic crosslinks cause internal damage, which heals by re-zipping. These gels may serve as model systems to explore mechanisms of deformation and energy dissipation, and expand the scope of hydrogel applications.","[Sun, Jeong-Yun; Illeperuma, Widusha R.

Thawing of Arctic permafrost could release significant amounts of carbon into the atmosphere in this century(3). Ancient Ice Complex deposits outcropping along the similar to 7,000-kilometre-long coastline of the East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS)(4,5), and associated shallow subsea permafrost(6,7), are two large pools of permafrost carbon(8), yet their vulnerabilities towards thawing and decomposition are largely unknown(9-11). Recent Arctic warming is stronger than has been predicted by several degrees, and is particularly pronounced over the coastal ESAS region(12,13). There is thus a pressing need to improve our understanding of the links between permafrost carbon and climate in this relatively inaccessible region. Here we show that extensive release of carbon from these Ice Complex deposits dominates (57 +/- 2 per cent) the sedimentary carbon budget of the ESAS, the world's largest continental shelf, overwhelming the marine and topsoil terrestrial components. Inverse modelling of the dual-carbon isotope composition of organic carbon accumulating in ESAS surface sediments, using Monte Carlo simulations to account for uncertainties, suggests that 44 +/- 10 teragrams of old carbon is activated annually from Ice Complex permafrost, an order of magnitude more than has been suggested by previous studies(14). We estimate that about two-thirds (66 +/- 16 per cent) of this old carbon escapes to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, with the remainder being re-buried in shelf sediments. Thermal collapse and erosion of these carbon-rich Pleistocene coastline and seafloor deposits may accelerate with Arctic amplification of climate warming(2,13).","[Vonk, J.

In contrast, warming has been comparatively modest over West Antarctica and significant changes have not been observed over most of East Antarctica(8,9), suggesting that the ice-core palaeoclimate records available from these areas may not be representative of the climate history of the Antarctic Peninsula. Here we show that the Antarctic Peninsula experienced an early-Holocene warm period followed by stable temperatures, from about 9,200 to 2,500 years ago, that were similar to modern-day levels. Our temperature estimates are based on an ice-core record of deuterium variations from James Ross Island, off the northeastern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. We find that the late-Holocene development of ice shelves near James Ross Island was coincident with pronounced cooling from 2,500 to 600 years ago. This cooling was part of a millennial-scale climate excursion with opposing anomalies on the eastern and western sides of the Antarctic Peninsula. Although warming of the northeastern Antarctic Peninsula began around 600 years ago, the high rate of warming over the past century is unusual (but not unprecedented) in the context of natural climate variability over the past two millennia. The connection shown here between past temperature and ice-shelf stability suggests that warming for several centuries rendered ice shelves on the northeastern Antarctic Peninsula vulnerable to collapse. Continued warming to temperatures that now exceed the stable conditions of most of the Holocene epoch is likely to cause ice-shelf instability to encroach farther southward along the Antarctic Peninsula.","[Mulvaney, Robert; Abram, Nerilie J.; Hindmarsh, Richard C.

Naive Drosophila melanogaster males, for example, court both virgin and mated females, but learn through experience to selectively suppress futile courtship towards females that have already mated(1). Here we show that courtship learning reflects an enhanced response to the male pheromone cis-vaccenyl acetate (cVA), which is deposited on females during mating and thus distinguishes mated females from virgins. Dissociation experiments suggest a simple learning rule in which unsuccessful courtship enhances sensitivity to cVA. The learning experience can be mimicked by artificial activation of dopaminergic neurons, and we identify a specific class of dopaminergic neuron that is critical for courtship learning. These neurons provide input to the mushroom body (MB) gamma lobe, and the DopR1 dopamine receptor is required in MB gamma neurons for both natural and artificial courtship learning. Our work thus reveals critical behavioural, cellular and molecular components of the learning rule by which Drosophila adjusts its innate mating strategy according to experience.","[Keleman, Krystyna; Vrontou, Eleftheria; Kruettner, Sebastian; Yu, Jai Y.; Kurtovic-Kozaric, Amina; Dickson, Barry J.] Res Inst Mol Pathol, A-1030 Vienna, Austria","Keleman, K (reprint author), Res Inst Mol Pathol, Dr Bohr Gasse 7, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",keleman@imp.ac.at; dickson@imp.ac.at,,"Yu, Jai/0000-0003-0628-2531; Kozaric, Amina/0000-0002-6063-7260",European Research Council; Austrian Science Fund; European Molecular Biology Organization; Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH,"We thank E.

Neuronal activity and experience, presumably acting on this local niche, regulate multiple stages of adult neurogenesis, from neural progenitor proliferation to new neuron maturation, synaptic integration and survival(1,3). It is unknown whether local neuronal circuitry has a direct impact on adult neural stem cells. Here we show that, in the adult mouse hippocampus, nestin-expressing radial glia-like quiescent neural stem cells(4-9) (RGLs) respond tonically to the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) by means of gamma(2)-subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors. Clonal analysis(9) of individual RGLs revealed a rapid exit from quiescence and enhanced symmetrical self-renewal after conditional deletion of gamma(2). RGLs are in close proximity to terminals expressing 67-kDa glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD67) of parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons and respond tonically to GABA released from these neurons. Functionally, optogenetic control of the activity of dentate PV+ interneurons, but not that of somatostatin-expressing or vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons, can dictate the RGL choice between quiescence and activation. Furthermore, PV+ interneuron activation restores RGL quiescence after social isolation, an experience that induces RGL activation and symmetrical division(8). Our study identifies a niche cell-signal-receptor trio and a local circuitry mechanism that control the activation and self-renewal mode of quiescent adult neural stem cells in response to neuronal activity and experience.","[Song, Juan; Zhong, Chun; Bonaguidi, Michael A.; Sun, Gerald J.; Hsu, Derek; Christian, Kimberly M.; Ming, Guo-li; Song, Hongjun] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Inst Cell Engn, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Song, Juan; Zhong, Chun; Bonaguidi, Michael A.; Christian, Kimberly M.; Ming, Guo-li; Song, Hongjun] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Sun, Gerald J.; Ming, Guo-li; Song, Hongjun] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Solomon H Snyder Dept Neurosci, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Gu, Yan; Ge, Shaoyu] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Neurobiol & Behav, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Meletis, Konstantinos] Karolinska Inst, Dept Neurosci, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Huang, Z.

JAK2 inhibitor therapy improves MPN-associated splenomegaly and systemic symptoms but does not significantly decrease or eliminate the MPN clone in most patients with MPN. We therefore sought to characterize mechanisms by which MPN cells persist despite chronic inhibition of JAK2. Here we show that JAK2 inhibitor persistence is associated with reactivation of JAK-STAT signalling and with heterodimerization between activated JAK2 and JAK1 or TYK2, consistent with activation of JAK2 in trans by other JAK kinases. Further, this phenomenon is reversible: JAK2 inhibitor withdrawal is associated with resensitization to JAK2 kinase inhibitors and with reversible changes in JAK2 expression. We saw increased JAK2 heterodimerization and sustained JAK2 activation in cell lines, in murine models and in patients treated with JAK2 inhibitors. RNA interference and pharmacological studies show that JAK2-inhibitor-persistent cells remain dependent on JAK2 protein expression. Consequently, therapies that result in JAK2 degradation retain efficacy in persistent cells and may provide additional benefit to patients with JAK2-dependent malignancies treated with JAK2 inhibitors.","[Koppikar, Priya; Bhagwat, Neha; Kilpivaara, Outi; Hricik, Todd; Saunders, Lindsay M.; Abdel-Wahab, Omar; Leung, Laura; Weinstein, Abby; Marubayashi, Sachie; Goel, Aviva; Levine, Ross L.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Human Oncol & Pathogenesis Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Bhagwat, Neha; Saunders, Lindsay M.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Gerstner Sloan Kettering Grad Sch Biomed Sci, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Manshouri, Taghi; Estrov, Zeev; Verstovsek, Srdan] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Adli, Mazhar; Bernstein, Bradley E.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Pathol, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Adli, Mazhar; Bernstein, Bradley E.] MIT, Broad Inst Harvard, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Mullally, Ann; Ebert, Benjamin L.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Hematol,Dept Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Abdel-Wahab, Omar; Nimer, Stephen D.; Levine, Ross L.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Leukemia Serv, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Goenen, Mithat] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, New York, NY 10065 USA","Levine, RL (reprint author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Human Oncol & Pathogenesis Program, New York, NY 10065 USA.",leviner@mskcc.org,,"Abdel-Wahab, Omar/0000-0002-3907-6171",National Cancer Institute [1R01CA151949-01]; Leukemia and Lymphoma Society; Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Foundation; Starr Cancer Consortium,"We thank C.

Yet, how B cells establish and maintain tolerance in the face of autoantigen exposure during and after development is not certain. Studies of model B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) transgenic systems have highlighted the critical role of functional unresponsiveness or 'anergy'(2,3). Unlike T cells, evidence suggests that receptor editing and anergy, rather than deletion, account for much of B-cell tolerance(4,5). However, it remains unclear whether the mature diverse B-cell repertoire of mice contains anergic autoreactive B cells, and if so, whether antigen was encountered during or after their development. By taking advantage of a reporter mouse in which BCR signalling rapidly and robustly induces green fluorescent protein expression under the control of the Nur77 regulatory region, antigen-dependent and antigen-independent BCR signalling events in vivo during B-cell maturation were visualized. Here we show that B cells encounter antigen during development in the spleen, and that this antigen exposure, in turn, tunes the responsiveness of BCR signalling in B cells at least partly by downmodulating expression of surface IgM but not IgD BCRs, and by modifying basal calcium levels. By contrast, no analogous process occurs in naive mature T cells. Our data demonstrate not only that autoreactive B cells persist in the mature repertoire, but that functional unresponsiveness or anergy exists in the mature B-cell repertoire along a continuum, a fact that has long been suspected, but never yet shown. These results have important implications for understanding how tolerance in T and B cells is differently imposed, and how these processes might go awry in disease.","[Zikherman, Julie; Parameswaran, Ramya; Weiss, Arthur] Univ Calif San Francisco, Rosalind Russell Med Res Ctr Arthrit, Dept Med, Div Rheumatol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Weiss, Arthur] Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Weiss, A (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Rosalind Russell Med Res Ctr Arthrit, Dept Med, Div Rheumatol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",aweiss@medicine.ucsf.edu,,"Zikherman, Julie/0000-0002-0873-192X",Rosalind Russell Medical Research Foundation Bechtel Award; American College of Rheumatology REF Rheumatology Investigator Award; Arthritis National Research Foundation; National Institutes of Health [K08 AR059723]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute,"We thank A.

Although optical interactions have been intensively studied, their microscopic details are often poorly understood and have so far not been directly measurable. X-ray and optical wave mixing was proposed nearly half a century ago as an atomic-scale probe of optical interactions but has not yet been observed owing to a lack of sufficiently intense X-ray sources. Here we use an X-ray laser to demonstrate X-ray and optical sum-frequency generation. The underlying nonlinearity is a reciprocal-space probe of the optically induced charges and associated microscopic fields that arise in an illuminated material. To within the experimental errors, the measured efficiency is consistent with first-principles calculations of microscopic optical polarization in diamond. The ability to probe optical interactions on the atomic scale offers new opportunities in both basic and applied areas of science.","[Glover, T.

The integrated effect of these processes is reflected in the calcium carbonate compensation depth, which is the oceanic depth at which calcium carbonate is dissolved. Here we present a carbonate accumulation record that covers the past 53 million years from a depth transect in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. The carbonate compensation depth tracks long-term ocean cooling, deepening from 3.0-3.5 kilometres during the early Cenozoic (approximately 55 million years ago) to 4.6 kilometres at present, consistent with an overall Cenozoic increase in weathering. We find large superimposed fluctuations in carbonate compensation depth during the middle and late Eocene. Using Earth system models, we identify changes in weathering and the mode of organic-carbon delivery as two key processes to explain these large-scale Eocene fluctuations of the carbonate compensation depth.","[Paelike, Heiko; Bohaty, Steven M.; Chun, Cecily O.

Sustainable management aimed at maintaining the flow of a broad range of benefits from the ocean requires a comprehensive and quantitative method to measure and monitor the health of coupled human-ocean systems. We created an index comprising ten diverse public goals for a healthy coupled human-ocean system and calculated the index for every coastal country. Globally, the overall index score was 60 out of 100 (range 36-86), with developed countries generally performing better than developing countries, but with notable exceptions. Only 5% of countries scored higher than 70, whereas 32% scored lower than 50. The index provides a powerful tool to raise public awareness, direct resource management, improve policy and prioritize scientific research.","[Halpern, Benjamin S.; Longo, Catherine; Hardy, Darren; O'Leary, Jennifer; Ranelletti, Marla; Scarborough, Courtney] Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA; [Halpern, Benjamin S.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Ctr Marine Assessment & Planning, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [McLeod, Karen L.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, COMPASS, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Samhouri, Jameal F.] NOAA, Conservat Biol Div, NW Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; [Katona, Steven K.; Rosenberg, Andrew A.; Selig, Elizabeth R.; Karrer, Leah Bunce; Stone, Gregory S.] Conservat Int, Arlington, VA 22202 USA; [Kleisner, Kristin; Pauly, Daniel; Sumaila, U.

Because antimicrobial agents of different classes and varying activity are effective across several vertebrate species, we proposed that such subtherapeutic administration alters the population structure of the gut microbiome as well as its metabolic capabilities. We generated a model of adiposity by giving subtherapeutic antibiotic therapy to young mice and evaluated changes in the composition and capabilities of the gut microbiome. Administration of subtherapeutic antibiotic therapy increased adiposity in young mice and increased hormone levels related to metabolism. We observed substantial taxonomic changes in the microbiome, changes in copies of key genes involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates to short-chain fatty acids, increases in colonic short-chain fatty acid levels, and alterations in the regulation of hepatic metabolism of lipids and cholesterol. In this model, we demonstrate the alteration of early-life murine metabolic homeostasis through antibiotic manipulation.","[Cho, Ilseung; Yamanishi, Shingo; Alekseyenko, Alexander V.; Blaser, Martin J.] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Med, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Cho, Ilseung; Blaser, Martin J.] VA New York Harbor Healthcare Syst, Med Serv, New York, NY 10010 USA; [Cox, Laura; Gao, Zhan; Mahana, Douglas; Raju, Kartik; Teitler, Isabel; Blaser, Martin J.] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Methe, Barbara A.; Li, Kelvin] J Craig Venter Inst, Rockville, MD 20850 USA; [Zavadil, Jiri] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Zavadil, Jiri; Alekseyenko, Alexander V.] NYU, Sch Med, Ctr Hlth Informat & Bioinformat, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Li, Huilin] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Populat Hlth, New York, NY 10016 USA","Blaser, MJ (reprint author), NYU, Sch Med, Dept Med, New York, NY 10016 USA.",martin.blaser@med.nyu.edu,,"Cox, Laura/0000-0002-9564-9894; Cho, Ilseung/0000-0002-7308-8707; Zavadil, Jiri/0000-0003-0640-5562; Alekseyenko, Alexander/0000-0002-5748-2085","NIH [T-RO1-DK090989, 1UL1-RR029893, UL1-TR000038]; Diane Belfer Program in Human Microbial Ecology; Philip and Janice Levin Foundation; Michael Saperstein Fellowship; J.

Although recent advances in chemical vapour deposition methods have enabled the large-scale production of both intrinsic and doped graphene(1-6), as well as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN)(7-10), controlled fabrication of lateral heterostructures in these truly atomically thin systems has not been achieved. Graphene/h-BN interfaces are of particular interest, because it is known that areas of different atomic compositions may coexist within continuous atomically thin films(5,10) and that, with proper control, the bandgap and magnetic properties can be precisely engineered(11-13). However, previously reported approaches for controlling these interfaces have fundamental limitations and cannot be easily integrated with conventional lithography(14-16). Here we report a versatile and scalable process, which we call 'patterned regrowth', that allows for the spatially controlled synthesis of lateral junctions between electrically conductive graphene and insulating h-BN, as well as between intrinsic and substitutionally doped graphene. We demonstrate that the resulting films form mechanically continuous sheets across these heterojunctions. Conductance measurements confirm laterally insulating behaviour for h-BN regions, while the electrical behaviour of both doped and undoped graphene sheets maintain excellent properties, with low sheet resistances and high carrier mobilities. Our results represent an important step towards developing atomically thin integrated circuitry and enable the fabrication of electrically isolated active and passive elements embedded in continuous, one-atom-thick sheets, which could be manipulated and stacked to form complex devices at the ultimate thickness limit.","[Levendorf, Mark P.; Kim, Cheol-Joo; Brown, Lola; Park, Jiwoong] Cornell Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Huang, Pinshane Y.; Havener, Robin W.; Muller, David A.] Cornell Univ, Sch Appl & Engn Phys, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Muller, David A.; Park, Jiwoong] Cornell Nanoscale Sci, Kavli Inst, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Park, J (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",jpark@cornell.edu,"Park, Jiwoong/C-2327-2013","Huang, Pinshane/0000-0002-1095-1833; Kim, Cheol-Joo/0000-0002-4312-3866; Muller, David/0000-0003-4129-0473","AFOSR [FA9550-09-1-0691, FA9550-10-1-0410]; NSF through the Cornell Centers for Materials Research [NSF DMR-1120296]; Alfred P.

The potential for methanogenic archaea to support the degradation of organic carbon to methane beneath the ice, however, has not yet been evaluated. Large sedimentary basins containing marine sequences up to 14 kilometres thick(2) and an estimated 21,000 petagrams (1 Pg equals 10(15) g) of organic carbon are buried beneath the Antarctic Ice Sheet. No data exist for rates of methanogenesis in sub-Antarctic marine sediments. Here we present experimental data from other subglacial environments that demonstrate the potential for overridden organic matter beneath glacial systems to produce methane. We also numerically simulate the accumulation of methane in Antarctic sedimentary basins using an established one-dimensional hydrate model(3) and show that pressure/temperature conditions favour methane hydrate formation down to sediment depths of about 300 metres in West Antarctica and 700 metres in East Antarctica. Our results demonstrate the potential for methane hydrate accumulation in Antarctic sedimentary basins, where the total inventory depends on rates of organic carbon degradation and conditions at the ice-sheet bed. We calculate that the sub-Antarctic hydrate inventory could be of the same order of magnitude as that of recent estimates made for Arctic permafrost. Our findings suggest that the Antarctic Ice Sheet may be a neglected but important component of the global methane budget, with the potential to act as a positive feedback on climate warming during ice-sheet wastage.","[Wadham, J.

The second post-melting weakening phase is governed by viscous properties of the melt layer and is reasonably well understood(5,6). The initial phase of extreme weakening, however, remains a subject of much debate. Here we show that the initial weakening of gabbro is associated with the formation of hotspots and macroscopic streaks of melt ('melt welts'), which partially unload the rest of the slip interface. Melt welts begin to form when the average rate of frictional heating exceeds 0.1-0.4 MW m(-2), while the average temperature of the shear zone is well below the solidus (250-450 degrees C). Similar heterogeneities in stress and temperature are likely to occur on natural fault surfaces during rapid slip, and to be important for earthquake rupture dynamics.","[Brown, Kevin M.; Fialko, Yuri] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Inst Geophys & Planetary Phys, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Brown, KM (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Inst Geophys & Planetary Phys, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",kmbrown@ucsd.edu; yfialko@ucsd.edu,"Fialko, Yuri/B-9567-2012","Fialko, Yuri/0000-0002-6161-8467",NSF [EAR-0838255],We thank D.

These networks produce left-right alternation of limbs as well as coordinated activation of flexor and extensor muscles(2). Here we show that a premature stop codon in the DMRT3 gene has a major effect on the pattern of locomotion in horses. The mutation is permissive for the ability to perform alternate gaits and has a favourable effect on harness racing performance. Examination of wild-type and Dmrt3-null mice demonstrates that Dmrt3 is expressed in the dI6 subdivision of spinal cord neurons, takes part in neuronal specification within this subdivision, and is critical for the normal development of a coordinated locomotor network controlling limb movements. Our discovery positions Dmrt3 in a pivotal role for configuring the spinal circuits controlling stride in vertebrates. The DMRT3 mutation has had a major effect on the diversification of the domestic horse, as the altered gait characteristics of a number of breeds apparently require this mutation.","[Andersson, Lisa S.; Schwochow, Doreen; Wellbring, Lisbeth; Mikko, Sofia; Lindgren, Gabriella; Andersson, Leif] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Anim Breeding & Genet, SE-75124 Uppsala, Sweden; [Larhammar, Martin; Memic, Fatima; Wootz, Hanna; Patra, Kalicharan; Vallstedt, Anna; Kullander, Klas] Uppsala Univ, Dept Neurosci, SE-75124 Uppsala, Sweden; [Rubin, Carl-Johan; Hjalm, Goran; Imsland, Freyja; Andersson, Leif] Uppsala Univ, Dept Med Biochem & Microbiol, SE-75123 Uppsala, Sweden; [Arnason, Thorvaldur] Agr Univ Iceland, Fac Land & Anim Resources, IS-311 Borgarnes, Iceland; [Petersen, Jessica L.; McCue, Molly E.; Mickelson, James R.] Univ Minnesota, Coll Vet Med, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Cothran, Gus] Texas A&M Univ, Coll Vet Med & Biomed Sci, Dept Vet Integrat Biosci, College Stn, TX 77483 USA; [Ahituv, Nadav] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Bioengn & Therapeut Sci, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Ahituv, Nadav] Univ Calif San Francisco, Inst Human Genet, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Roepstorff, Lars] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Unit Equine Studies, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden","Andersson, LS (reprint author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Anim Breeding & Genet, SE-75124 Uppsala, Sweden.",leif.andersson@imbim.uu.se,,"Mikko, Sofia/0000-0002-6375-1376; Kullander, Klas/0000-0001-6418-5460; Ahituv, Nadav/0000-0002-7434-8144","Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research; Swedish Research Council Formas [221-2009-1631]; Swedish Research Council Medicine and Health [2007-3630/4479, 2010-4394]; Swedish Society for Medical Research; National Institute of Child Health & Human Development [R01HD059862]; Swedish Brain Foundation; Uppsala University and Hospital, SciLife Lab - Uppsala and the Swedish Research Council [80576801, 70374401]; Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation","Thanks to S.

Recent studies have implicated the cerebellum in these disorders, with post-mortem studies in ASD patients showing cerebellar Purkinje cell (PC) loss(2,3), and isolated cerebellar injury has been associated with a higher incidence of ASDs(4). However, the extent of cerebellar contribution to the pathogenesis of ASDs remains unclear. Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disorder with high rates of comorbid ASDs(5) that result from mutation of either TSC1 or TSC2, whose protein products dimerize and negatively regulate mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling. TSC is an intriguing model to investigate the cerebellar contribution to the underlying pathogenesis of ASDs, as recent studies in TSC patients demonstrate cerebellar pathology(6) and correlate cerebellar pathology with increased ASD symptomatology(7,8). Functional imaging also shows that TSC patients with ASDs display hypermetabolism in deep cerebellar structures, compared to TSC patients without ASDs(9). However, the roles of Tsc1 and the sequelae of Tsc1 dysfunction in the cerebellum have not been investigated so far. Here we show that both heterozygous and homozygous loss of Tsc1 in mouse cerebellar PCs results in autistic-like behaviours, including abnormal social interaction, repetitive behaviour and vocalizations, in addition to decreased PC excitability. Treatment of mutant mice with the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, prevented the pathological and behavioural deficits. These findings demonstrate new roles for Tsc1 in PC function and define a molecular basis for a cerebellar contribution to cognitive disorders such as autism.","[Tsai, Peter T.; Greene-Colozzi, Emily; Sadowski, Abbey R.; Leech, Jarrett M.; Steinberg, Jason; Sahin, Mustafa] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston Childrens Hosp, FM Kirby Neurobiol Ctr,Dept Neurol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Hull, Court; Chu, YunXiang; Regehr, Wade G.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Crawley, Jacqueline N.] NIMH, Lab Behav Neurosci, Intramural Res Program, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Sahin, M (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston Childrens Hosp, FM Kirby Neurobiol Ctr,Dept Neurol, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",peter.tsai@childrens.harvard.edu; mustafa.sahin@childrens.harvard.edu,,"Hull, Court/0000-0002-0360-8367","Developmental Neurology Training grant [T32 NS007473]; American Academy of Neurology; Nancy Lurie Marks Family Foundation; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R01 NS58956]; John Merck Scholars Fund; Autism Speaks; Boston Children's Hospital Translational Research Program; Manton Center for Orphan Disease Research; Boston Children's Hospital Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center [P30 HD18655]; Intramural Research Program, National Institute of Mental Health; NIH [R01NS032405]; Simons Foundation [SFARI 232304]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute Medical Research Fellowship","We thank G.

Here we describe an early and essential stage of somatic cell reprogramming, preceding the induction of transcription at endogenous pluripotency loci such as Nanog and Esrrb. By day 4 after transduction with OSKM, two epigenetic modification factors necessary for iPSC generation, namely poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (Parp1) and ten-eleven translocation-2 (Tet2), are recruited to the Nanog and Esrrb loci. These epigenetic modification factors seem to have complementary roles in the establishment of early epigenetic marks during somatic cell reprogramming: Parp1 functions in the regulation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) modification, whereas Tet2 is essential for the early generation of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) by the oxidation of 5mC (refs 3,4). Although 5hmC has been proposed to serve primarily as an intermediate in 5mC demethylation to cytosine in certain contexts(5-7), our data, and also studies of Tet2-mutant human tumour cells(8), argue in favour of a role for 5hmC as an epigenetic mark distinct from 5mC. Consistent with this, Parp1 and Tet2 are each needed for the early establishment of histone modifications that typify an activated chromatin state at pluripotency loci, whereas Parp1 induction further promotes accessibility to the Oct4 reprogramming factor. These findings suggest that Parp1 and Tet2 contribute to an epigenetic program that directs subsequent transcriptional induction at pluripotency loci during somatic cell reprogramming.","[Doege, Claudia A.; Inoue, Keiichi; Yamashita, Toru; Rhee, David B.; Travis, Skylar; Fujita, Ryousuke; Bhagat, Govind; Vanti, William B.; Abeliovich, Asa] Columbia Univ, Dept Pathol & Cell Biol, Taub Inst Aging, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Doege, Claudia A.; Inoue, Keiichi; Yamashita, Toru; Rhee, David B.; Travis, Skylar; Fujita, Ryousuke; Bhagat, Govind; Vanti, William B.; Abeliovich, Asa] Columbia Univ, Dept Neurol, Taub Inst Aging, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Guarnieri, Paolo] Columbia Univ, Bioinformat Div, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Guarnieri, Paolo; Bhagat, Govind] Columbia Univ, Herbert Irving Comprehens Canc Ctr, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Shih, Alan; Levine, Ross L.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Human Oncol & Pathogenesis Program, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Nik, Sara; Chen, Emily I.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Pharmacol Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Chen, Emily I.] SUNY Stony Brook, Prote Ctr, Sch Med, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA","Abeliovich, A (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Dept Pathol & Cell Biol, Taub Inst Aging, New York, NY 10032 USA.",aa900@columbia.edu,"Vanti, William/E-6518-2016","Vanti, William/0000-0002-5591-5350; Inoue, Keiichi/0000-0002-7101-486X; Bhagat, Govind/0000-0001-6250-048X","New York State Stem Cell Science (NYSTEM) [C024402, C024403]; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [RO1 NS064433]; NYSTEM Institution Development [N08G-071]; NIH [RO1 138424]; NIH/National Center for Research Resources [1 S10 RR023680-1]","We thank G.

These alterations are gain-of-function mutations in that they drive the synthesis of the 'oncometabolite' R-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG)(3). It remains unclear how IDH1 and IDH2 mutations modify myeloid cell development and promote leukaemogenesis. Here we report the characterization of conditional knock-in (KI) mice in which the most common IDH1 mutation, IDH1(R132H), is inserted into the endogenous murine Idh1 locus and is expressed in all haematopoietic cells (Vav-KI mice) or specifically in cells of the myeloid lineage (LysM-KI mice). These mutants show increased numbers of early haematopoietic progenitors and develop splenomegaly and anaemia with extramedullary haematopoiesis, suggesting a dysfunctional bone marrow niche. Furthermore, LysM-KI cells have hypermethylated histones and changes to DNA methylation similar to those observed in human IDH1- or IDH2-mutant AML. To our knowledge, our study is the first to describe the generation and characterization of conditional IDH1(R132H)-KI mice, and also the first report to demonstrate the induction of a leukaemic DNA methylation signature in a mouse model.

Here we analyse systematically more than 70 pairs of primary human colon tumours by applying next-generation sequencing to characterize their exomes, transcriptomes and copy-number alterations. We have identified 36,303 protein-altering somatic changes that include several new recurrent mutations in the Wnt pathway gene TCF7L2, chromatin-remodelling genes such as TET2 and TET3 and receptor tyrosine kinases including ERBB3. Our analysis for significantly mutated cancer genes identified 23 candidates, including the cell cycle checkpoint kinase ATM. Copy-number and RNA-seq data analysis identified amplifications and corresponding overexpression of IGF2 in a subset of colon tumours. Furthermore, using RNA-seq data we identified multiple fusion transcripts including recurrent gene fusions involving R-spondin family members RSPO2 and RSPO3 that together occur in 10% of colon tumours. The RSPO fusions were mutually exclusive with APC mutations, indicating that they probably have a role in the activation of Wnt signalling and tumorigenesis. Consistent with this we show that the RSPO fusion proteins were capable of potentiating Wnt signalling. The R-spondin gene fusions and several other gene mutations identified in this study provide new potential opportunities for therapeutic intervention in colon cancer.","[Seshagiri, Somasekar; Stawiski, Eric W.; Durinck, Steffen; Modrusan, Zora; Storm, Elaine E.; Chaudhuri, Subhra; Guan, Yinghui; Janakiraman, Vasantharajan; Jaiswal, Bijay S.; Guillory, Joseph; Ha, Connie; Dijkgraaf, Gerrit J.

Here we find that the related RNF43 and ZNRF3 transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligases are uniquely expressed in LGR5(+) stem cells. Simultaneous deletion of the two genes encoding these proteins in the intestinal epithelium of mice induces rapidly growing adenomas containing high numbers of Paneth and LGR5(+) stem cells. In vitro, growth of organoids derived from these adenomas is arrested when Wnt secretion is inhibited, indicating a dependence of the adenoma stem cells on Wnt produced by adenoma Paneth cells. In the HEK293T human cancer cell line, expression of RNF43 blocks Wnt responses and targets surface-expressed frizzled receptors to lysosomes. In the RNF43-mutant colorectal cancer cell line HCT116, reconstitution of RNF43 expression removes its response to exogenous Wnt. We conclude that RNF43 and ZNRF3 reduce Wnt signals by selectively ubiquitinating frizzled receptors, thereby targeting these Wnt receptors for degradation.","[Spit, Maureen; Jordens, Ingrid; Maurice, Madelon M.] Univ Med Ctr Utrecht, Dept Cell Biol, NL-3584 CX Utrecht, Netherlands; [Koo, Bon-Kyoung; Stange, Daniel E.; van de Wetering, Marc; van Es, Johan H.; Clevers, Hans] KNAW, Hubrecht Inst, NL-3584 CT Utrecht, Netherlands; [Koo, Bon-Kyoung; Stange, Daniel E.; van de Wetering, Marc; van Es, Johan H.; Clevers, Hans] Univ Med Ctr Utrecht, NL-3584 CT Utrecht, Netherlands; [Low, Teck Y.; Mohammed, Shabaz; Heck, Albert J.

By studying HMGB1 release mechanisms, here we identify a role for double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR, also known as EIF2AK2) in inflammasome activation. Exposure of macrophages to inflammasome agonists induced PKR autophosphorylation. PKR inactivation by genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition severely impaired inflammasome activation in response to double-stranded RNA, ATP, monosodium urate, adjuvant aluminium, rotenone, live Escherichia coli, anthrax lethal toxin, DNA transfection and Salmonella typhimurium infection. PKR deficiency significantly inhibited the secretion of IL-1 beta, IL-18 and HMGB1 in E. coli-induced peritonitis. PKR physically interacts with several inflammasome components, including NOD-like receptor (NLR) family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3), NLRP1, NLR family CARD domain-containing protein 4 (NLRC4), absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2), and broadly regulates inflammasome activation. PKR autophosphorylation in a cell-free system with recombinant NLRP3, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC, also known as PYCARD) and pro-caspase-1 reconstitutes inflammasome activity. These results show a crucial role for PKR in inflammasome activation, and indicate that it should be possible to pharmacologically target this molecule to treat inflammation.","[Lu, Ben; Li, Jianhua; Valdes-Ferrer, Sergio I.; Olofsson, Peder S.; Kalb, Thomas; Roth, Jesse; Yang, Huan; Chavan, Sangeeta S.; Tracey, Kevin J.] Feinstein Inst Med Res, Lab Biomed Sci, Manhasset, NY 11030 USA; [Lu, Ben; Valdes-Ferrer, Sergio I.; Tracey, Kevin J.] N Shore LIJ Hlth Syst, Elmezzi Grad Sch Mol Med, Manhasset, NY 11030 USA; [Nakamura, Takahisa; Inouye, Karen; Hotamisligil, Goekhan S.] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Genet & Complex Dis, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Tang, Yiting; Zou, Yongrui] Feinstein Inst Med Res, Ctr Autoimmun & Musculoskeletal Dis, New York, NY 11030 USA; [Lundback, Peter; Erlandsson-Harris, Helena] Karolinska Univ Hosp, Karolinska Inst, Dept Med, S-17176 Stockholm, Sweden; [Ting, Jenny P. -Y.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Wang, Haichao] N Shore Univ Hosp, Dept Emergency Med, Manhasset, NY 11030 USA; [Antoine, Daniel J.] Univ Liverpool, Dept Mol & Clin Pharmacol, MRC Ctr Drug Safety Sci, Liverpool L69 3GE, Merseyside, England","Tracey, KJ (reprint author), Feinstein Inst Med Res, Lab Biomed Sci, 350 Community Dr, Manhasset, NY 11030 USA.",blu@nshs.edu; kjtracey@nshs.edu,"Wang, Haichao/K-6310-2012; Lundback, Peter /B-5010-2013","Wang, Haichao/0000-0002-0211-9000; Valdes-Ferrer, Sergio Ivan/0000-0002-4863-6484; Tracey, Kevin J/0000-0003-1884-6314; Lundback, Peter/0000-0003-0399-0399; Andersson, Ulf/0000-0003-0316-3860","National Institutes of Health [RO1 GM62508, DK052539]; foundation of Elmezzi Graduate School of Molecular Medicine; International Human Frontier Science Program; American Heart Association","We thank H.

In the autoimmune disease multiple sclerosis, myelin-reactive T-cell blasts are thought to transgress the BBB1,2 and create a pro-inflammatory environment in the CNS, thereby making possible a second autoimmune attack that starts from the leptomeningeal vessels and progresses into the parenchyma(3-6). Using a Lewis rat model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, we show here that contrary to the expectations of this concept, T-cell blasts do not efficiently enter the CNS and are not required to prepare the BBB for immune-cell recruitment. Instead, intravenously transferred T-cell blasts gain the capacity to enter the CNS after residing transiently within the lung tissues. Inside the lung tissues, they move along and within the airways to bronchus-associated lymphoid tissues and lung-draining mediastinal lymph nodes before they enter the blood circulation from where they reach the CNS. Effector T cells transferred directly into the airways showed a similar migratory pattern and retained their full pathogenicity. On their way the T cells fundamentally reprogrammed their gene-expression profile, characterized by downregulation of their activation program and upregulation of cellular locomotion molecules together with chemokine and adhesion receptors. The adhesion receptors include ninjurin 1, which participates in T-cell intravascular crawling on cerebral blood vessels. We detected that the lung constitutes a niche not only for activated T cells but also for resting myelin-reactive memory T cells. After local stimulation in the lung, these cells strongly proliferate and, after assuming migratory properties, enter the CNS and induce paralytic disease. The lung could therefore contribute to the activation of potentially autoaggressive T cells and their transition to a migratory mode as a prerequisite to entering their target tissues and inducing autoimmune disease.","[Odoardi, Francesca; Sie, Christopher; Schlaeger, Christian; Lodygin, Dmitri; Fluegel, Alexander] Gemeinnutzige Hertie Stiftung, Inst Multiple Sclerosis Res, Dept Neuroimmunol, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Odoardi, Francesca; Sie, Christopher; Schlaeger, Christian; Lodygin, Dmitri; Fluegel, Alexander] Univ Med Ctr Gottingen, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Streyl, Kristina; Ulaganathan, Vijay K.; Heckelsmiller, Klaus; Klinkert, Wolfgang E.

We detected the first eukaryote diguanylate cyclases in all major groups of Dictyostelia. On food depletion, Dictyostelium discoideum amoebas collect into aggregates, which first transform into migrating slugs and then into sessile fruiting structures(3). These structures consist of a spherical spore mass that is supported by a column of stalk cells and a basal disk. Apolyketide, DIF-1, which induces stalklike cells in vitro, was isolated earlier(4). However, its role in vivo proved recently to be restricted to basal disk formation(5). Here we show that the Dictyostelium diguanylate cyclase, DgcA, produces c-di-GMP as the morphogen responsible for stalk cell differentiation. Dictyostelium discoideum DgcA synthesized c-di-GMP in a GTP-dependent manner and was expressed at the slug tip, which is the site of stalk cell differentiation. Disruption of the DgcA gene blocked the transition from slug migration to fructification and the expression of stalk genes. Fructification and stalk formation were restored by exposing DgcA-null slugs to wild-type secretion products or to c-di-GMP. Moreover, c-di-GMP, but not cyclic di-(3':5')-adenosine monophosphate, induced stalk gene expression in dilute cell monolayers. Apart from identifying the long-elusive stalk-inducing morphogen, our work also identifies a role for c-di-GMP in eukaryotes.","[Chen, Zhi-hui; Schaap, Pauline] Univ Dundee, Coll Life Sci, Dundee DD1 5EH, Scotland","Schaap, P (reprint author), Univ Dundee, Coll Life Sci, Dundee DD1 5EH, Scotland.",p.schaap@dundee.ac.uk,,"Schaap, Pauline/0000-0003-4500-2555",Wellcome Trust [090276]; BBSRC [BB/G020426],"We thank R.

The rate of de novo mutations is therefore of major importance to evolution. Here we conduct a study of genome-wide mutation rates by sequencing the entire genomes of 78 Icelandic parent-offspring trios at high coverage. We show that in our samples, with an average father's age of 29.7, the average de novo mutation rate is 1.20 x 10(-8) per nucleotide per generation. Most notably, the diversity in mutation rate of single nucleotide polymorphisms is dominated by the age of the father at conception of the child. The effect is an increase of about two mutations per year. An exponential model estimates paternal mutations doubling every 16.5 years. After accounting for random Poisson variation, father's age is estimated to explain nearly all of the remaining variation in the de novo mutation counts. These observations shed light on the importance of the father's age on the risk of diseases such as schizophrenia and autism.","[Kong, Augustine; Frigge, Michael L.; Masson, Gisli; Besenbacher, Soren; Sulem, Patrick; Magnusson, Gisli; Gudjonsson, Sigurjon A.; Sigurdsson, Asgeir; Jonasdottir, Aslaug; Jonasdottir, Adalbjorg; Sigurdsson, Gunnar; Walters, G.

However, quantum optical effects in optomechanical systems have remained obscure, because their detection requires the object's motion to be dominated by vacuum fluctuations in the optical radiation pressure; so far, direct observations have been stymied by technical and thermal noise. Here we report an implementation of cavity optomechanics(9,10) using ultracold atoms in which the collective atomic motion is dominantly driven by quantum fluctuations in radiation pressure. The back-action of this motion onto the cavity light field produces ponderomotive squeezing(11,12). We detect this quantum phenomenon by measuring sub-shot-noise optical squeezing. Furthermore, the system acts as a low-power, high-gain, nonlinear parametric amplifier for optical fluctuations, demonstrating a gain of 20 dB with a pump corresponding to an average of only seven intracavity photons. These findings may pave the way for low-power quantum optical devices, surpassing quantum limits on position and force sensing(13,14), and the control and measurement of motion in quantum gases.","[Brooks, Daniel W.

If the second conductor is part of a closed circuit, a net current will flow in that circuit. The drag current is typically much smaller than the drive current owing to the heavy screening of the Coulomb interaction. There are, however, rare situations in which strong electronic correlations exist between the two conductors. For example, double quantum well systems can support exciton condensates, which consist of electrons in one well tightly bound to holes in the other(4-6). 'Perfect' drag is therefore expected; a steady transport current of electrons driven through one quantum well should be accompanied by an equal current of holes in the other(7). Here we demonstrate this effect, taking care to ensure that the electron-hole pairs dominate the transport and that tunnelling of charge between the quantum wells, which can readily compromise drag measurements, is negligible. We note that, from an electrical engineering perspective, perfect Coulomb drag is analogous to an electrical transformer that functions at zero frequency.","[Nandi, D.; Finck, A. D.

In this context, organic ferroelectrics(3,4) are of particular interest because they promise to be lightweight, inexpensive and easily processed into devices. A recently identified family of organic ferroelectric structures is based on intermolecular charge transfer, where donor and acceptor molecules co-crystallize in an alternating fashion known as a mixed stack(5-8): in the crystalline lattice, a collective transfer of electrons from donor to acceptor molecules results in the formation of dipoles that can be realigned by an external field as molecules switch partners in the mixed stack. Although mixed stacks have been investigated extensively, only three systems are known(9,10) to show ferroelectric switching, all below 71 kelvin. Here we describe supramolecular charge-transfer networks that undergo ferroelectric polarization switching with a ferroelectric Curie temperature above room temperature. These polar and switchable systems utilize a structural synergy between a hydrogen-bonded network and charge-transfer complexation of donor and acceptor molecules in a mixed stack. This supramolecular motif could help guide the development of other functional organic systems that can switch polarization under the influence of electric fields at ambient temperatures.","[Shveyd, Alexander K.; Sue, Andrew C-H; Szarko, Jodi M.; Rolczynski, Brian S.; Cao, Dennis; Sarjeant, Amy A.; Stern, Charlotte L.; Paxton, Walter F.; Dey, Sanjeev K.; Fahrenbach, Albert C.; Chen, Lin X.; Stoddart, J.

It is a precursor to tropospheric ozone and it influences the atmosphere's oxidative capacity through its reaction with the hydroxyl radical, ethane's primary atmospheric sink(1-3). Here we present the longest continuous record of global atmospheric ethane levels. We show that global ethane emission rates decreased from 14.3 to 11.3 teragrams per year, or by 21 per cent, from 1984 to 2010. We attribute this to decreasing fugitive emissions from ethane's fossil fuel source-most probably decreased venting and flaring of natural gas in oil fields-rather than a decline in its other major sources, biofuel use and biomass burning. Ethane's major emission sources are shared with methane, and recent studies have disagreed on whether reduced fossil fuel or microbial emissions have caused methane's atmospheric growth rate to slow(4,5). Our findings suggest that reduced fugitive fossil fuel emissions account for at least 10-21 teragrams per year (30-70 per cent) of the decrease in methane's global emissions, significantly contributing to methane's slowing atmospheric growth rate since the mid-1980s.","[Simpson, Isobel J.; Andersen, Mads P.

In the Hindu Kush-Karakoram-Himalaya region (HKKH), a paucity of appropriate glacier data has prevented a comprehensive assessment of current regional mass balance(5). There is, however, indirect evidence of a complex pattern of glacial responses(5-8) in reaction to heterogeneous climate change signals(9). Here we use satellite laser altimetry and a global elevation model to show widespread glacier wastage in the eastern, central and southwestern parts of the HKKH during 2003-08. Maximal regional thinning rates were 0.66 +/- 0.09 metres per year in the Jammu-Kashmir region. Conversely, in the Karakoram, glaciers thinned only slightly by a few centimetres per year. Contrary to expectations, regionally averaged thinning rates under debris-mantled ice were similar to those of clean ice despite insulation by debris covers. The 2003-08 specific mass balance for our entire HKKH study region was -0.21 +/- 0.05 m yr(-1) water equivalent, significantly less negative than the estimated global average for glaciers and ice caps(4,10). This difference is mainly an effect of the balanced glacier mass budget in the Karakoram. The HKKH sea level contribution amounts to one per cent of the present-day sea level rise(11). Our 2003-08 mass budget of -12.8 +/- 3.5 gigatonnes (Gt) per year is more negative than recent satellite-gravimetry-based estimates of -5 +/- 3 Gt yr(-1) over 2003-10 (ref. 12). For the mountain catchments of the Indus and Ganges basins(13), the glacier imbalance contributed about 3.5% and about 2.0%, respectively, to the annual average river discharge(13), and up to 10% for the Upper Indus basin(14).","[Kaab, Andreas; Nuth, Christopher] Univ Oslo, Dept Geosci, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Berthier, Etienne] Univ Toulouse, CNRS, LEGOS, F-31400 Toulouse, France; [Gardelle, Julie] Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, LGGE, F-38402 St Martin Dheres, France; [Arnaud, Yves] Univ Grenoble 1, IRD, LTHE LGGE, F-38402 St Martin Dheres, France","Kaab, A (reprint author), Univ Oslo, Dept Geosci, POB 1047, N-0316 Oslo, Norway.",kaeaeb@geo.uio.no,"Berthier, Etienne/B-8900-2009","Berthier, Etienne/0000-0001-5978-9155","European Space Agency (ESA) [21088/07/I-EC, 4000101778/10/I-AM]; Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) through the TOSCA programme; French National Research Agency [ANR-09-CEP-005-01/PAPRIKA]; PNTS; CNES/CNRS; Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) through the ISIS programme","We thank G.

Approximately 10% of cases are familial (FALS), typically with a dominant inheritance mode. Despite numerous advances in recent years(1-9), nearly 50% of FALS cases have unknown genetic aetiology. Here we show that mutations within the profilin 1 (PFN1) gene can cause FALS. PFN1 is crucial for the conversion of monomeric (G)-actin to filamentous (F)-actin. Exome sequencing of two large ALS families showed different mutations within the PFN1 gene. Further sequence analysis identified 4 mutations in 7 out of 274 FALS cases. Cells expressing PFN1 mutants contain ubiquitinated, insoluble aggregates that in many cases contain the ALS-associated protein TDP-43.

Furthermore, primary motor neurons expressing mutant PFN1 display smaller growth cones with a reduced F/G-actin ratio.

Testing diverse genetic and epigenetic features, here we show that mutation rates in cancer genomes are strikingly related to chromatin organization. Indeed, at the megabase scale, a single feature-levels of the heterochromatin-associated histone modification H3K9me3-can account for more than 40% of mutation-rate variation, and a combination of features can account for more than 55%. The strong association between mutation rates and chromatin organization is upheld in samples from different tissues and for different mutation types. This suggests that the arrangement of the genome into heterochromatin- and euchromatin-like domains is a dominant influence on regional mutation-rate variation in human somatic cells.","[Schuster-Boeckler, Benjamin; Lehner, Ben] CRG, EMBL CRG Syst Biol Unit, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Schuster-Boeckler, Benjamin; Lehner, Ben] UPF, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Schuster-Boeckler, Benjamin] Pear Comp LLP, London W5 1SH, England; [Lehner, Ben] Passeig Lluis Co 23, ICREA, Barcelona 08010, Spain","Lehner, B (reprint author), CRG, EMBL CRG Syst Biol Unit, Barcelona 08003, Spain.",ben.lehner@crg.es,"Lehner, Ben/L-3413-2014","Lehner, Ben/0000-0002-8817-1124; Schuster-Bockler, Benjamin/0000-0002-8892-5133","European Research Council (ERC); European Union [277899 4DCellFate]; ERASysBioPLUS; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion (MICINN) [BFU2008-00365, BFU2011-26206]; Agencia de Gestio d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca (AGAUR); European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO); EMBL-CRG Systems Biology Program; Juan de la Cierva postdoctoral fellowship; ICREA","This work was funded by an European Research Council (ERC) Starting Grant, European Union Framework 7 project 277899 4DCellFate, ERASysBioPLUS, Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion (MICINN) grants BFU2008-00365 and BFU2011-26206, Agencia de Gestio d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca (AGAUR), the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) Young Investigator Program, the EMBL-CRG Systems Biology Program and a Juan de la Cierva postdoctoral fellowship to B.S-B.

Moreover, the modest contribution that these variants make to disease risk has raised questions regarding their medical relevance(2). Here we have investigated a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the TNFRSF1A gene, that encodes tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1), which was discovered through GWAS to be associated with multiple sclerosis (MS)(3,4), but not with other autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis(5), psoriasis(6) and Crohn's disease(7). By analysing MS GWAS(3,4) data in conjunction with the 1000 Genomes Project data(8) we provide genetic evidence that strongly implicates this SNP, rs1800693, as the causal variant in the TNFRSF1A region. We further substantiate this through functional studies showing that the MS risk allele directs expression of a novel, soluble form of TNFR1 that can block TNF. Importantly, TNF-blocking drugs can promote onset or exacerbation of MS9-11, but they have proven highly efficacious in the treatment of autoimmune diseases for which there is no association with rs1800693. This indicates that the clinical experience with these drugs parallels the disease association of rs1800693, and that the MS-associated TNFR1 variant mimics the effect of TNF-blocking drugs. Hence, our study demonstrates that clinical practice can be informed by comparing GWAS across common autoimmune diseases and by investigating the functional consequences of the disease-associated genetic variation.","[Gregory, Adam P.; Kaur, Gurman; Punwani, Divya; Felce, James H.; Davis, Simon J.; Fugger, Lars] Univ Oxford, Weatherall Inst Mol Med, John Radcliffe Hosp, MRC Human Immunol Unit, Oxford OX3 9DS, England; [Dendrou, Calliope A.; Attfield, Kathrine E.; Haghikia, Aiden; Lambert, Lydia; Leach, Oliver A.; Proemel, Simone; Fugger, Lars] Univ Oxford, John Radcliffe Hosp, Div Clin Neurol, Nuffield Dept Clin Neurosci, Oxford OX3 9DS, England; [Haghikia, Aiden; Gold, Ralf] Ruhr Univ Bochum, St Josef Hosp Bochum, Dept Neurol, D-44791 Bochum, Germany; [Xifara, Dionysia K.; McVean, Gil] Univ Oxford, Wellcome Trust Ctr Human Genet, Oxford OX3 7BN, England; [Butter, Falk; Mann, Matthias] Max Planck Inst Biochem, Dept Prote & Signal Transduct, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany; [Poschmann, Gereon] Univ Dusseldorf, Biol Med Forschungszentrum, Mol Prote Lab, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany; [Nielsen, Finn C.] Univ Copenhagen, Rigshosp, Ctr Genom Med, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark; [Siegel, Richard M.] NIAMSD, Immunoregulat Sect, Autoimmun Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Bell, John I.] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX3 7DG, England; [Fugger, Lars] Skejby Sygehus, Aarhus Univ Hosp, Inst Clin, DK-8200 Aarhus N, Denmark","Fugger, L (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Weatherall Inst Mol Med, John Radcliffe Hosp, MRC Human Immunol Unit, Oxford OX3 9DS, England.",lars.fugger@imm.ox.ac.uk,"Mann, Matthias/A-3454-2013","Mann, Matthias/0000-0003-1292-4799; Felce, James/0000-0001-5531-9244; Butter, Falk/0000-0002-7197-7279; Dendrou, Calliope/0000-0003-1179-4021; McVean, Gil/0000-0002-5012-4162","UK Medical Research Council (MRC); European Union [FP7/2007-2013]; Naomi Bramson Trust; Wellcome Trust [090532/Z/09/Z, 086084/Z/08/Z]; MRC; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Christopher Welch Scholarship; MS Society; Dorothy Hodgkin Postgraduate Award","We thank the volunteers who donated blood samples, the IMSGC and WTCCC2 for data access, A.

After the paired presentation of an odour and a reward, Drosophila melanogaster can develop a conditioned approach towards that odour(2,3). Despite recent advances in understanding the neural circuits for associative memory and appetitive motivation(4), the cellular mechanisms for reward processing in the fly brain are unknown. Here we show that a group of dopamine neurons in the protocerebral anterior medial (PAM) cluster signals sugar reward by transient activation and inactivation of target neurons in intact behaving flies. These dopamine neurons are selectively required for the reinforcing property of, but not a reflexive response to, the sugar stimulus. In vivo calcium imaging revealed that these neurons are activated by sugar ingestion and the activation is increased on starvation. The output sites of the PAM neurons are mainly localized to the medial lobes of the mushroom bodies (MBs), where appetitive olfactory associative memory is formed(5,6). We therefore propose that the PAM cluster neurons endow a positive predictive value to the odour in the MBs. Dopamine in insects is known to mediate aversive reinforcement signals(5,7-11). Our results highlight the cellular specificity underlying the various roles of dopamine and the importance of spatially segregated local circuits within the MBs.","[Liu, Chang; Yamagata, Nobuhiro; Aso, Yoshinori; Friedrich, Anja B.; Siwanowicz, Igor; Tanimoto, Hiromu] Max Planck Inst Neurobiol, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany; [Liu, Chang] Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Zool, Lab Primate Cognit Neurosci, Kunming 650223, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Liu, Chang] Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Univ, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Placais, Pierre-Yves; Preat, Thomas] Ecole Super Phys & Chim Ind Ville Paris, CNRS, Neurobiol Unit, F-75005 Paris, France; [Pfeiffer, Barret D.; Aso, Yoshinori; Rubin, Gerald M.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA","Tanimoto, H (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Neurobiol, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany.",hiromut@neuro.mpg.de,"; Tanimoto, Hiromu/J-6810-2016","Rubin, Gerald/0000-0001-8762-8703; Preat, Thomas/0000-0001-9976-1763",Max-Planck-Gesellschaft; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation; Region Ile-de-France; Agence Nationale pour la Recherche; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung,"We thank L.

By minimizing gaps and overlaps within the arborization, self-avoidance facilitates complete coverage of a neuron's territory by its neurites(1-3). Remarkably, some neurons that display self-avoidance interact freely with other neurons of the same subtype, implying that they discriminate self from non-self. Here we demonstrate roles for the clustered protocadherins (Pcdhs) in dendritic self-avoidance and self/non-self discrimination. The Pcdh locus encodes 58 related cadherin-like transmembrane proteins, at least some of which exhibit isoform-specific homophilic adhesion in heterologous cells and are expressed stochastically and combinatorially in single neurons(7-11). Deletion of all 22 Pcdh genes in the mouse gamma-subcluster (Pcdhg genes) disrupts self-avoidance of dendrites in retinal starburst amacrine cells (SACs) and cerebellar Purkinje cells. Further genetic analysis of SACs showed that Pcdhg proteins act cell-autonomously during development, and that replacement of the 22 Pcdhg proteins with a single isoform restores self-avoidance. Moreover, expression of the same single isoform in all SACs decreases interactions among dendrites of neighbouring SACs (heteroneuronal interactions). These results suggest that homophilic Pcdhg interactions between sibling neurites (isoneuronal interactions) generate a repulsive signal that leads to self-avoidance. In this model, heteroneuronal interactions are normally permitted because dendrites seldom encounter a matched set of Pcdhg proteins unless they emanate from the same soma. In many respects, our results mirror those reported for Dscam1 (Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule) in Drosophila: this complex gene encodes thousands of recognition molecules that exhibit stochastic expression and isoform-specific interactions, and mediate both self-avoidance and self/non-self discrimination(4-7,12-15). Thus, although insect Dscam and vertebrate Pcdh proteins share no sequence homology, they seem to underlie similar strategies for endowing neurons with distinct molecular identities and patterning their arborizations.","[Lefebvre, Julie L.; Kostadinov, Dimitar; Sanes, Joshua R.] Harvard Univ, Ctr Brain Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Lefebvre, Julie L.; Kostadinov, Dimitar; Sanes, Joshua R.] Harvard Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Chen, Weisheng V.; Maniatis, Tom] Columbia Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, New York, NY 10032 USA","Sanes, JR (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Ctr Brain Sci, 52 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",sanesj@mcb.harvard.edu,,"Kostadinov, Dimitar/0000-0001-7548-2209","NIH [R01NS029169, R01EY022073, R01NS043915]; NARSAD","We thank members of our laboratory for providing advice and reagents, including D.

This poor prognosis is due to therapeutic resistance and tumour recurrence after surgical removal. Precisely how recurrence occurs is unknown. Using a genetically engineered mouse model of glioma, here we identify a subset of endogenous tumour cells that are the source of new tumour cells after the drug temozolomide (TMZ) is administered to transiently arrest tumour growth. A nestin-Delta TK-IRES-GFP (Nes-Delta TK-GFP) transgene that labels quiescent subventricular zone adult neural stem cells also labels a subset of endogenous glioma tumour cells. On arrest of tumour cell proliferation with TMZ, pulse-chase experiments demonstrate a tumour re-growth cell hierarchy originating with the Nes-Delta TK-GFP transgene subpopulation. Ablation of the GFP(+) cells with chronic ganciclovir administration significantly arrested tumour growth, and combined TMZ and ganciclovir treatment impeded tumour development. Thus, a relatively quiescent subset of endogenous glioma cells, with properties similar to those proposed for cancer stem cells, is responsible for sustaining long-term tumour growth through the production of transient populations of highly proliferative cells.","[Chen, Jian; Li, Yanjiao; Yu, Tzong-Shiue; McKay, Renee M.; Kernie, Steven G.; Parada, Luis F.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Dev Biol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Chen, Jian; Li, Yanjiao; Yu, Tzong-Shiue; McKay, Renee M.; Kernie, Steven G.; Parada, Luis F.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Kent Waldrep Ctr Basic Res Nerve Growth & Regener, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Yu, Tzong-Shiue; Kernie, Steven G.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Pediat, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Burns, Dennis K.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Pathol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA","Parada, LF (reprint author), Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Dev Biol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA.",luis.parada@utsouthwestern.edu,"Parada, luis/B-9400-2014",,James S.

Until now, CSC properties have only been investigated by transplantation assays, and their existence in unperturbed tumour growth is unproven. Here we make use of clonal analysis of squamous skin tumours using genetic lineage tracing to unravel the mode of tumour growth in vivo in its native environment. To this end, we used a genetic labelling strategy that allows individual tumour cells to be marked and traced over time at different stages of tumour progression. Surprisingly, we found that the majority of labelled tumour cells in benign papilloma have only limited proliferative potential, whereas a fraction has the capacity to persist long term, giving rise to progeny that occupy a significant part of the tumour. As well as confirming the presence of two distinct proliferative cell compartments within the papilloma, mirroring the composition, hierarchy and fate behaviour of normal tissue, quantitative analysis of clonal fate data indicates that the more persistent population has stem-cell-like characteristics and cycles twice per day, whereas the second represents a slower cycling transient population that gives rise to terminally differentiated tumour cells. Such behaviour is shown to be consistent with double-labelling experiments and detailed clonal fate characteristics. By contrast, measurements of clone size and proliferative potential in invasive squamous cell carcinoma show a different pattern of behaviour, consistent with geometric expansion of a single CSC population with limited potential for terminal differentiation. This study presents the first experimental evidence for the existence of CSCs during unperturbed solid tumour growth.","[Simons, Benjamin D.] Univ Cambridge, Cavendish Lab, Dept Phys, Cambridge CB3 0HE, England; [Driessens, Gregory; Beck, Benjamin; Caauwe, Amelie; Blanpain, Cedric] Univ Libre Brussels, IRIBHM, B-1070 Brussels, Belgium; [Simons, Benjamin D.] Univ Cambridge, Wellcome Trust Canc Res UK Gurdon Inst, Cambridge CB2 1QN, England; [Blanpain, Cedric] WELBIO, B-1070 Brussels, Belgium","Simons, BD (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Cavendish Lab, Dept Phys, JJ Thomson Ave, Cambridge CB3 0HE, England.",bds10@cam.ac.uk; Cedric.Blanpain@ulb.ac.be,,"Simons, Benjamin/0000-0002-3875-7071",Brussels Region; FNRS; program d'excellence CIBLES of the Wallonia Region; Fondation Contre le Cancer; ULB foundation; fond Gaston Ithier; European Research Council (ERC); EMBO,"C.B. is investigator of WELBIO and chercheur qualifie of the FRS/FNRS.

The molecular basis for long-distance transport of glucosinolates and other defence compounds, however, remains unknown. Here we identify and characterize two members of the nitrate/peptide transporter family, GTR1 and GTR2, as high-affinity, proton-dependent glucosinolate-specific transporters. The gtr1 gtr2 double mutant did not accumulate glucosinolates in seeds and had more than tenfold over-accumulation in source tissues such as leaves and silique walls, indicating that both plasma membrane-localized transporters are essential for long-distance transport of glucosinolates. We propose that GTR1 and GTR2 control the loading of glucosinolates from the apoplasm into the phloem. Identification of the glucosinolate transporters has agricultural potential as a means to control allocation of defence compounds in a tissue-specific manner.","[Nour-Eldin, Hussam Hassan; Andersen, Tonni Grube; Burow, Meike; Madsen, Svend Roesen; Jorgensen, Morten Egevang; Olsen, Carl Erik; Halkier, Barbara Ann] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Sci, Dept Plant & Environm Sci, VKR Res Ctr Proact Plants, DK-1871 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Nour-Eldin, Hussam Hassan; Andersen, Tonni Grube; Burow, Meike; Madsen, Svend Roesen; Jorgensen, Morten Egevang; Olsen, Carl Erik; Halkier, Barbara Ann] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Sci, Dept Plant & Environm Sci, DynaMo Ctr Excellence, DK-1871 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Dreyer, Ingo] Univ Politecn Madrid, Ctr Plant Biotechnol & Genom, E-28223 Pozuelo De Alarcon, Madrid, Spain; [Hedrich, Rainer; Geiger, Dietmar] Univ Wurzburg, Julius von Sachs Inst, D-97082 Wurzburg, Germany","Halkier, BA (reprint author), Univ Copenhagen, Fac Sci, Dept Plant & Environm Sci, VKR Res Ctr Proact Plants, Thorvaldsensvej 40, DK-1871 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.",bah@life.ku.dk,"Burow, Meike/A-6949-2010; Olsen, Carl/H-3031-2014; Nour-Eldin, Hussam/I-1214-2014; Geiger, Dietmar/D-6914-2014; Halkier, Barbara/H-3196-2014; Jorgensen, Morten Egevang/A-2795-2016; Dreyer, Ingo/N-4747-2014; Hedrich, Rainer/G-8771-2011","Burow, Meike/0000-0002-2350-985X; Olsen, Carl/0000-0002-2275-0596; Nour-Eldin, Hussam/0000-0001-6660-0509; Geiger, Dietmar/0000-0003-0715-5710; Halkier, Barbara/0000-0002-3742-702X; Jorgensen, Morten Egevang/0000-0001-6503-0495; Dreyer, Ingo/0000-0002-2781-0359; Hedrich, Rainer/0000-0003-3224-1362; Andersen, Tonni/0000-0002-8905-0850","Danish Research Council for Technology and Production (FTP) [09-065827/274-08-0354]; Marie Curie fellowship [PIEF-GA-2008-221236]; European Union [303674]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [GE2195/1-1, FOR 1061]; Villum Kann Rasmussen Foundation; Danish National Research Foundation","We thank M.

Natural phosphorus reserves are limited(1), and it is therefore important to develop phosphorus-efficient crops. A major quantitative trait locus for phosphorus-deficiency tolerance, Pup1, was identified in the traditional aus-type rice variety Kasalath about a decade ago(2,3). However, its functional mechanism remained elusive(4,5) until the locus was sequenced, showing the presence of a Pup1-specific protein kinase gene(6), which we have named phosphorus-starvation tolerance 1 (PSTOL1). This gene is absent from the rice reference genome and other phosphorus-starvation-intolerant modern varieties(7,8). Here we show that overexpression of PSTOL1 in such varieties significantly enhances grain yield in phosphorus-deficient soil. Further analyses show that PSTOL1 acts as an enhancer of early root growth, thereby enabling plants to acquire more phosphorus and other nutrients. The absence of PSTOL1 and other genes-for example, the submergence-tolerance gene SUB1A-from modern rice varieties underlines the importance of conserving and exploring traditional germplasm. Introgression of this quantitative trait locus into locally adapted rice varieties in Asia and Africa is expected to considerably enhance productivity under low phosphorus conditions.","[Gamuyao, Rico; Chin, Joong Hyoun; Catausan, Sheryl; Dalid, Cheryl; Slamet-Loedin, Inez; Heuer, Sigrid] Int Rice Res Inst, Manila 1301, Philippines; [Pariasca-Tanaka, Juan; Wissuwa, Matthias] JIRCAS, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058686, Japan; [Pesaresi, Paolo] Univ Milan, Dipartimento Biosci, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Tecson-Mendoza, Evelyn Mae] Univ Philippines, Los Banos 4031, Laguna, Philippines","Heuer, S (reprint author), Int Rice Res Inst, DAPO Box 7777, Manila 1301, Philippines.",s.heuer@cgiar.org,"Chin, Joong Hyoun/L-1307-2015","Chin, Joong Hyoun/0000-0003-3932-8639; Pesaresi, Paolo/0000-0002-3236-7005",Generation Challenge Program (GCP),"We would like to thank A.

During embryogenesis and in cancer, the telomerase enzyme counteracts telomeric DNA shortening. As shown in cancer cells, human telomerase binds the shelterin component TPP1 at telomeres(4,5) during the S phase of the cell cycle, and adds similar to 60 nucleotides in a single round of extension(6), after which telomerase is turned off by unknown mechanisms. Here we show that the human CST (CTC1, STN1 and TEN1) complex, previously implicated in telomere protection and DNA metabolism(7-11), inhibits telomerase activity through primer sequestration and physical interaction with the protection of telomeres 1 (POT1)-TPP1 telomerase processivity factor(12,13). CST competes with POT1-TPP1 for telomeric DNA, and CST-telomeric-DNA binding increases during late S/G2 phase only on telomerase action, coinciding with telomerase shut-off. Depletion of CST allows excessive telomerase activity, promoting telomere elongation. We propose that through binding of the telomerase-extended telomere, CST limits telomerase action at individual telomeres to approximately one binding and extension event per cell cycle. Our findings define the sequence of events that occur to first enable and then terminate telomerase-mediated telomere elongation.","[Chen, Liuh-Yow; Redon, Sophie; Lingner, Joachim] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Frontiers Genet Natl Ctr Competence Res, Sch Life Sci, Swiss Inst Expt Canc Res ISREC,Stn 19, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","Lingner, J (reprint author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Frontiers Genet Natl Ctr Competence Res, Sch Life Sci, Swiss Inst Expt Canc Res ISREC,Stn 19, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",joachim.lingner@epfl.ch,,"Lingner, Joachim/0000-0002-2853-5803; Chen, liuh-yow/0000-0002-9857-068X",Swiss National Science Foundation; European Research Council [232812]; Swiss Cancer League; EPFL,"We thank P.

We propose that homozygous deletions in such passenger genes can expose cancer-specific therapeutic vulnerabilities when the collaterally deleted gene is a member of a functionally redundant family of genes carrying out an essential function. The glycolytic gene enolase 1 (ENO1) in the 1p36 locus is deleted in glioblastoma (GBM), which is tolerated by the expression of ENO2. Here we show that short-hairpin-RNA-mediated silencing of ENO2 selectively inhibits growth, survival and the tumorigenic potential of ENO1-deleted GBM cells, and that the enolase inhibitor phosphonoacetohydroxamate is selectively toxic to ENO1-deleted GBM cells relative to ENO1-intact GBM cells or normal astrocytes. The principle of collateral vulnerability should be applicable to other passenger-deleted genes encoding functionally redundant essential activities and provide an effective treatment strategy for cancers containing such genomic events.","[Muller, Florian L.; Colla, Simona; Aquilanti, Elisa; Manzo, Veronica E.; Genovese, Giannicola; Lee, Jaclyn; Eisenson, Daniel; Narurkar, Rujuta; Deng, Pingna; Nezi, Luigi; Lee, Michelle A.; Hu, Baoli; Hu, Jian; Sahin, Ergun; Ong, Derrick; Fletcher-Sananikone, Eliot; Ho, Dennis; Kwong, Lawrence; Wang, Y.

Here we use a new platform for two-way light-based circuit interrogation in visual cortex in vivo to show the computational implications of modulating different subclasses of inhibitory neurons during sensory processing. We find that soma-targeting, parvalbumin-expressing (PV) neurons principally divide responses but preserve stimulus selectivity, whereas dendrite-targeting, somatostatin-expressing (SOM) neurons principally subtract from excitatory responses and sharpen selectivity. Visualized in vivo cell-attached recordings show that division by PV neurons alters response gain, whereas subtraction by SOM neurons shifts response levels. Finally, stimulating identified neurons while scanning many target cells reveals that single PV and SOM neurons functionally impact only specific subsets of neurons in their projection fields.

These observations reveal an exceptionally luminous (8.2 x 10(45) erg s(-1)) galaxy cluster that hosts an extremely strong cooling flow (around 3,820 solar masses a year). Further, the central galaxy in this cluster appears to be experiencing a massive starburst (formation of around 740 solar masses a year), which suggests that the feedback source responsible for preventing runaway cooling in nearby cool-core clusters may not yet be fully established in SPT-CLJ2344-4243. This large starformation rate implies that a significant fraction of the stars in the central galaxy of this cluster may form through accretion of the intracluster medium, rather than (as is currently thought) assembling entirely via mergers.","[McDonald, M.; Sullivan, P.; Bautz, M.; Miller, E.

However, the maser, which amplifies microwave radiation rather than visible light, has not had as large an impact, despite being instrumental in the laser's birth(1,2). The maser's relative obscurity has mainly been due to the inconvenience of the operating conditions needed for its various realizations: atomic(3) and free-electron(4) masers require vacuum chambers and pumping; and solid-state masers(5), although they excel as low-noise amplifiers(6) and are occasionally incorporated in ultrastable oscillators(7,8), typically require cryogenic refrigeration. Most realizations of masers also require strong magnets, magnetic shielding or both. Overcoming these various obstacles would pave the way for improvements such as more-sensitive chemical assays, more-precise determinations of biomolecular structure and function, and more-accurate medical diagnostics (including tomography) based on enhanced magnetic resonance spectrometers(9) incorporating maser amplifiers and oscillators. Here we report the experimental demonstration of a solid-state maser operating at room temperature in pulsed mode. It works on a laboratory bench, in air, in the terrestrial magnetic field and amplifies at around 1.45 gigahertz. In contrast to the cryogenic ruby maser(6), in our maser the gain medium is an organic mixed molecular crystal, p-terphenyl doped with pentacene, the latter being photo-excited by yellow light. The maser's pumping mechanism exploits spin-selective molecular intersystem crossing(10) into pentacene's triplet ground state(11,12). When configured as an oscillator, the solid-state maser's measured output power of around -10 decibel milliwatts is approximately 100 million times greater than that of an atomic hydrogen maser(3), which oscillates at a similar frequency (about 1.42 gigahertz). By exploiting the high levels of spin polarization readily generated by intersystem crossing in photo-excited pentacene and other aromatic molecules, this new type of maser seems to be capable of amplifying with a residual noise temperature far below room temperature.","[Oxborrow, Mark] Natl Phys Lab, Teddington TW11 0LW, Middx, England; [Breeze, Jonathan D.; Alford, Neil M.] Imperial Coll London, Dept Mat, London SW7 2AZ, England","Oxborrow, M (reprint author), Natl Phys Lab, Hampton Rd, Teddington TW11 0LW, Middx, England.",mo@npl.co.uk; n.alford@imperial.ac.uk,,"Breeze, Jonathan/0000-0002-3962-270X",NMS Pathfinder Metrology Programme; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council,"M.O. thanks J.

The electron, possessing spin and orbital degrees of freedom, is conventionally used as the carrier of quantum information in proposed devices(4,5,6,7,8,9). However, electrons couple strongly to the environment, and so have very short relaxation and coherence times. It is therefore extremely difficult to achieve quantum coherence and stable entanglement of electron spins. Alternative concepts propose nuclear spins as the building blocks for quantum computing(10), because such spins are extremely well isolated from the environment and less prone to decoherence. However, weak coupling comes at a price: it remains challenging to address and manipulate individual nuclear spins(11,12,13,14). Here we show that the nuclear spin of an individual metal atom embedded in a single-molecule magnet can be read out electronically. The observed long lifetimes ( tens of seconds) and relaxation characteristics of nuclear spin at the single-atom scale open the way to a completely new world of devices in which quantum logic may be implemented.","[Vincent, Romain; Wernsdorfer, Wolfgang; Balestro, Franck] CNRS, Inst Neel, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France; [Vincent, Romain; Wernsdorfer, Wolfgang; Balestro, Franck] Univ Grenoble 1, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France; [Klyatskaya, Svetlana; Ruben, Mario] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Nanotechnol, D-76344 Eggenstein Leopoldshafen, Germany; [Ruben, Mario] Univ Strasbourg, CNRS, Inst Phys & Chim Mat Strasbourg, F-67034 Strasbourg, France","Balestro, F (reprint author), CNRS, Inst Neel, BP 166, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France.",mario.ruben@kit.edu; franck.balestro@grenoble.cnrs.fr,"Ruben, Mario/C-6816-2008; Wernsdorfer, Wolfgang/M-2280-2016","Ruben, Mario/0000-0002-7718-7016; Wernsdorfer, Wolfgang/0000-0003-4602-5257","French National Research Agency National Programme in Nanosciences and Nanotechnologies (ANR-PNANO) project MolNanoSpin [ANR-08-NANO-002]; European Research Council Advanced Grant MolNanoSpin [226558]; Future Emerging Technologies Open, Quantum Information Processing Specific Targeted Research Project [ICT-2007.8.0, 211284 MolSpinQIP]; German Research Foundation programme TRR 88 '3Met'; Cible; Nanosciences Foundation of Grenoble","We thank E.

Nitrogen-isotope data from ocean sediments suggest that the marine-nitrogen inventory has been balanced for the past 3,000 years (ref. 4). Producing a balanced marine-nitrogen budget based on direct measurements has proved difficult, however, with nitrogen loss exceeding the gain from dinitrogen fixation by approximately 200 TgNyr(-1) (refs 5, 6). Here we present data from the Atlantic Ocean and show that the most widely used method of measuring oceanic N-2-fixation rates(7) underestimates the contribution of N-2-fixing microorganisms (diazotrophs) relative to a newly developed method(8). Using molecular techniques to quantify the abundance of specific clades of diazotrophs in parallel with rates of N-15(2) incorporation into particulate organic matter, we suggest that the difference between N-2-fixation rates measured with the established method(7) and those measured with the new method8 can be related to the composition of the diazotrophic community. Our data show that in areas dominated by Trichodesmium, the established method underestimates N-2-fixation rates by an average of 62%. We also find that the newly developed method yields N-2-fixation rates more than six times higher than those from the established method when unicellular, symbiotic cyanobacteria and c-proteobacteria dominate the diazotrophic community. On the basis of average areal rates measured over the Atlantic Ocean, we calculated basin-wide N-2-fixation rates of 14 +/- 1 Tg N yr(-1) and 24 +/- 1 Tg N yr(-1) for the established and new methods, respectively. If our findings can be extrapolated to other ocean basins, this suggests that the global marine N-2-fixation rate derived from direct measurements may increase from 103 +/- 8 Tg N yr(-1) to 177 +/- 8 Tg N yr(-1), and that the contribution of N-2 fixers other than Trichodesmium is much more significant than was previously thought.","[Grosskopf, Tobias; Mohr, Wiebke; Baustian, Tina; Schunck, Harald; Gill, Diana; LaRoche, Julie] Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel GEOMAR, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Kuypers, Marcel M.

Owing to its strong rainfall gradient, a small displacement in the position of the SPCZ causes drastic changes to hydroclimatic conditions and the frequency of extreme weather events-such as droughts, floods and tropical cyclones-experienced by vulnerable island countries in the region(1-7). The SPCZ position varies from its climatological mean location with the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), moving a few degrees northward during moderate El Nino events and southward during La Nina events(2,5,6). During strong El Nino events, however, the SPCZ undergoes an extreme swing-by up to ten degrees of latitude toward the Equator-and collapses to a more zonally oriented structure(5) with commensurately severe weather impacts(5,8-11). Understanding changes in the characteristics of the SPCZ in a changing climate is therefore of broad scientific and socioeconomic interest. Here we present climate modelling evidence for a near doubling in the occurrences of zonal SPCZ events between the periods 1891-1990 and 1991-2090 in response to greenhouse warming, even in the absence of a consensus on how ENSO will change(12-14). We estimate the increase in zonal SPCZ events from an aggregation of the climate models in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phases 3 and 5 (CMIP3(15) and CMIP5) multi-model database that are able to simulate such events. The change is caused by a projected enhanced equatorial warming in the Pacific(16) and may lead to more frequent occurrences of extreme events across the Pacific island nations most affected by zonal SPCZ events.","[Cai, Wenju; Lengaigne, Matthieu; Cowan, Tim] CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Aspendale, Vic 3195, Australia; [Lengaigne, Matthieu; Vincent, Emmanuel M.] UPMC, LOCEAN, F-75252 Paris 05, France; [Collins, Matthew] Univ Exeter, Coll Engn Math & Phys Sci, Exeter EX4 4QF, Devon, England; [Collins, Matthew] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England; [McPhaden, Michael J.] NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Timmermann, Axel] Univ Hawaii, SOEST, Dept Oceanog, IPRC, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Power, Scott; Brown, Josephine] Bur Meteorol, Ctr Australian Weather & Climate Res, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia; [Menkes, Christophe] Inst Rech Dev, Noumea 98848, New Caledonia; [Ngari, Arona] Meteorol Serv, Avarua, Rarotonga, Cook Islands; [Widlansky, Matthew J.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Int Pacific Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA","Cai, WJ (reprint author), CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Aspendale, Vic 3195, Australia.",wenju.cai@csiro.au,"Vincent, Emmanuel/J-9855-2012; Cowan, Tim/A-5797-2013; Cai, Wenju/C-2864-2012; Lengaigne, Matthieu/K-4345-2013; Lengaigne, Matthieu/M-8321-2014; Collins, Matthew/F-8473-2011; McPhaden, Michael/D-9799-2016; menkes, christophe/H-9085-2016","Vincent, Emmanuel/0000-0003-4529-5490; Lengaigne, Matthieu/0000-0002-0044-036X; Collins, Matthew/0000-0003-3785-6008; menkes, christophe/0000-0002-1457-9696; Brown, Josephine/0000-0002-1100-7457; Timmermann, Axel /0000-0003-0657-2969",Australian Climate Change Science Program; CSIRO Office of Chief Executive Science Leader programme; Pacific-Australia Climate Change Science and Adaptation Planning Program; Office of Science (BER) US Department of Energy [DE-FG02-07ER64469]; US National Science Foundation [1049219]; Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC); NOAA; CSIRO; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD);  [3830],"This work was supported by the Australian Climate Change Science Program, CSIRO Office of Chief Executive Science Leader programme, and the Pacific-Australia Climate Change Science and Adaptation Planning Program.

One contentious issue is whether the settlement occurred by means of a single(6-8) migration or multiple streams of migration from Siberia(9-15). The pattern of dispersals within the Americas is also poorly understood. To address these questions at a higher resolution than was previously possible, we assembled data from 52 Native American and 17 Siberian groups genotyped at 364,470 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Here we show that Native Americans descend from at least three streams of Asian gene flow. Most descend entirely from a single ancestral population that we call `First American'. However, speakers of Eskimo-Aleut languages from the Arctic inherit almost half their ancestry from a second stream of Asian gene flow, and the Na-Dene-speaking Chipewyan from Canada inherit roughly one-tenth of their ancestry from a third stream. We show that the initial peopling followed a southward expansion facilitated by the coast, with sequential population splits and little gene flow after divergence, especially in South America. A major exception is in Chibchan speakers on both sides of the Panama isthmus, who have ancestry from both North and South America.","[Reich, David; Tandon, Arti] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA;

For a given region, substructure, layer or even cell type, variability in neuronal morphology and connectivity persists(2-5). Although it is well known that such cellular properties vary considerably according to neuronal type, the substantial biophysical diversity of neurons of the same morphological class is typically averaged out and ignored. Here we show that the amplitude of hyperpolarization-evoked sag of membrane potential recorded in olfactory bulb mitral cells is an emergent, homotypic property of local networks and sensory information processing. Simultaneous whole-cell recordings from pairs of cells show that the amount of hyperpolarization-evoked sag potential and current (I-h)(6) is stereotypic for mitral cells belonging to the same glomerular circuit. This is corroborated by a mosaic, glomerulus-based pattern of expression of the HCN2 (hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotidegated channel 2) subunit of the Ih channel. Furthermore, inter-glomerular differences in both membrane potential sag and HCN2 protein are diminished when sensory input to glomeruli is genetically and globally altered so that only one type of odorant receptor is universally expressed(7). Population diversity in this intrinsic property therefore reflects differential expression between local mitral cell networks processing distinct odour-related information.","[Angelo, Kamilla; Rancz, Ede A.; Pimentel, Diogo; Margrie, Troy W.] UCL, Dept Neurosci Physiol & Pharmacol, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Angelo, Kamilla; Hundahl, Christian] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Neurosci & Pharmacol, DK-2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark; [Rancz, Ede A.; Pichler, Bruno; Margrie, Troy W.] MRC Natl Inst Med Res, Div Neurophysiol, London NW7 1AA, England; [Hundahl, Christian; Hannibal, Jens] Univ Copenhagen, Bispebjerg Hosp, Dept Clin Biochem, DK-2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark; [Fleischmann, Alexander] Coll France, Ctr Interdisciplinary Res Biol CIRB, F-75231 Paris 05, France","Margrie, TW (reprint author), UCL, Dept Neurosci Physiol & Pharmacol, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",troy.margrie@nimr.mrc.ac.uk,,"Rancz, Ede Attila/0000-0002-7951-1385; Hannibal, Jens/0000-0001-9416-0125",Sir Henry Wellcome Fellowship; Oticon Foundation; Danish Council for Independent Research; Lundbeckfondation; Gulbenkian PhD Programme; Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia; Wellcome Trust; Medical Research Council [MC_U1175975156],"We thank M.

In the neocortex, a large diversity of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) interneurons has been identified on the basis of their morphology, molecular markers, biophysical properties and innervation pattern(1-3). However, how the activity of each subtype of interneurons contributes to sensory processing remains unclear. Here we show that optogenetic activation of parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons in the mouse primary visual cortex (V1) sharpens neuronal feature selectivity and improves perceptual discrimination. Using multichannel recording with silicon probes(4,5) and channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)-mediated optical activation(6), we found that increased spiking of PV+ interneurons markedly sharpened orientation tuning and enhanced direction selectivity of nearby neurons. These effects were caused by the activation of inhibitory neurons rather than a decreased spiking of excitatory neurons, as archaerhodopsin-3 (Arch)-mediated optical silencing(7) of calcium/calmodulindependent protein kinase II alpha (CAMKII alpha)-positive excitatory neurons caused no significant change in V1 stimulus selectivity. Moreover, the improved selectivity specifically required PV+ neuron activation, as activating somatostatin or vasointestinal peptide interneurons had no significant effect. Notably, PV+ neuron activation in awake mice caused a significant improvement in their orientation discrimination, mirroring the sharpened V1 orientation tuning. Together, these results provide the first demonstration that visual coding and perception can be improved by increased spiking of a specific subtype of cortical inhibitory interneurons.","[Lee, Seung-Hee; Kwan, Alex C.; Zhang, Siyu; Phoumthipphavong, Victoria; Flannery, John G.; Dan, Yang] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Div Neurobiol, Helen Wills Neurosci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Lee, Seung-Hee; Dan, Yang] Univ Calif Berkeley, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Masmanidis, Sotiris C.] CALTECH, Kavli Nanosci Inst, Broad Fellows Program Brain Circuitry, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Taniguchi, Hiroki; Huang, Z.

Although these effectors contribute to pathogen virulence, we realized that they might also serve as valuable synthetic biology reagents for engineering cellular behaviour. Here we exploit two effector proteins, the Shigella flexneri OspF protein(3) and Yersinia pestis YopH protein(4), to rewire kinase-mediated responses systematically both in yeast and mammalian immune cells. Bacterial effector proteins can be directed to inhibit specific mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways selectively in yeast by artificially targeting them to pathway-specific complexes. Moreover, we show that unique properties of the effectors generate new pathway behaviours: OspF, which irreversibly inactivates mitogen-activated protein kinases(4), was used to construct a synthetic feedback circuit that shows novel frequency-dependent input filtering. Finally, we show that effectors can be used in T cells, either as feedback modulators to tune the T-cell response amplitude precisely, or as an inducible pause switch that can temporarily disable T-cell activation. These studies demonstrate how pathogens could provide a rich toolkit of parts to engineer cells for therapeutic or biotechnological applications.","[Wei, Ping; Wong, Wilson W.; Park, Jason S.; Peisajovich, Sergio G.; Onuffer, James J.; Lim, Wendell A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Cellular & Mol Pharmacol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Wei, Ping; Wong, Wilson W.; Park, Jason S.; Corcoran, Ethan E.; Peisajovich, Sergio G.; Weiss, Arthur; Lim, Wendell A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Wong, Wilson W.; Park, Jason S.; Corcoran, Ethan E.; Onuffer, James J.; Weiss, Arthur; Lim, Wendell A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Cell Prop Lab, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Corcoran, Ethan E.; Weiss, Arthur] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Med, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA","Lim, WA (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Cellular & Mol Pharmacol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA.",lim@cmp.ucsf.edu,,,"American Cancer Society fellowship [PF-09-137-01-TBE]; Li Foundation Fellowship; California Institute for Regenerative Medicine fellowship [TG2-01153]; National Institutes of Health [PN2EY016546, RO1GM055040, RO1GM062583, P50GM081879]; NSF Synthetic Biology and Engineering Research Center; Packard Foundation; Howard Hughes Medical Institute","We thank K.

Mice lacking the NLR family member NLRP6 were recently shown to be susceptible to colitis and colorectal tumorigenesis(2-4), but the role of NLRP6 in microbial infections and the nature of the inflammatory signalling pathways regulated by NLRP6 remain unclear. Here we show that Nlrp6-deficient mice are highly resistant to infection with the bacterial pathogens Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli. Infected Nlrp6-deficient mice had increased numbers of monocytes and neutrophils in circulation, and NLRP6 signalling in both haematopoietic and radioresistant cells contributed to increased susceptibility. Nlrp6 deficiency enhanced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the canonical NF-kappa B pathway after Toll-like receptor ligation, but not cytosolic NOD1/2 ligation, in vitro. Consequently, infected Nlrp6-deficient cells produced increased levels of NF-kappa B-and MAPK-dependent cytokines and chemokines. Thus, our results reveal NLRP6 as a negative regulator of inflammatory signalling, and demonstrate a role for this NLR in impeding clearance of both Gram-positive and -negative bacterial pathogens.","[Anand, Paras K.; Malireddi, R.

Here we report that genetic loss of APJ, a G-protein-coupled receptor, confers resistance to chronic pressure overload by markedly reducing myocardial hypertrophy and heart failure. In contrast, mice lacking apelin (the endogenous APJ ligand) remain sensitive, suggesting an apelin-independent function of APJ. Freshly isolated APJ-null cardiomyocytes exhibit an attenuated response to stretch, indicating that APJ is a mechanosensor. Activation of APJ by stretch increases cardiomyocyte cell size and induces molecular markers of hypertrophy. Whereas apelin stimulates APJ to activate G alpha(i) and elicits a protective response, stretch signals in an APJ-dependent, G-protein-independent fashion to induce hypertrophy. Stretch-mediated hypertrophy is prevented by knockdown of beta-arrestins or by pharmacological doses of apelin acting through G alpha(i). Taken together, our data indicate that APJ is a bifunctional receptor for both mechanical stretch and the endogenous peptide apelin. By sensing the balance between these stimuli, APJ occupies a pivotal point linking sustained overload to cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.","[Scimia, Maria Cecilia; Hurtado, Cecilia; Ray, Saugata; Wei, Ke; Wang, Jianming; Akasaka, Takeshi; Bodmer, Rolf; Smith, Layton H.; Mercola, Mark; Ruiz-Lozano, Pilar] Sanford Burnham Med Res Inst, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Metzler, Scott; Ruiz-Lozano, Pilar] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Woods, Chris E.; Ashley, Euan] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Purcell, Nicole H.; Brown, Joan Heller] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Pharmacol, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Catalucci, Daniele] CNR, Biomed & Genet Res Inst, I-20138 Milan, Italy; [Catalucci, Daniele] Humanitas Clin & Res Ctr, I-20089 Milan, Italy; [Bueno, Orlando F.; Vlasuk, George P.] Wyeth Pharmaceut, Madison, NJ USA; [Kaliman, Perla] Inst Biomed Res August Pi & Sunyer IDIBAPS, E-08036 Barcelona, Spain","Ruiz-Lozano, P (reprint author), Sanford Burnham Med Res Inst, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",prlozano@stanford.edu,"Ray, Saugata/E-3160-2012; Catalucci, Daniele/B-6745-2015","Catalucci, Daniele/0000-0001-7041-6114; Smith, Layton/0000-0003-2621-9740","Wyeth Sponsored Research Agreement; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R01HL086879, R37HL059502, R01HL083463, R01HL054732, NS05422, RO1HL28143, P01 HL085577]; Sanford Children's Center; Ellison Medical Foundation; Muscular Dystrophy association; Florida Department of Health [06-NIR-09]; California Institute for Regenerative Medicine; Italian Ministry of Research and Education; Italian Society of Cardiology (SIC and Sanofi-Aventis Foundation); American Heart Association Postdoctoral Award; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion (MICINN) Spain [SAF2010-15050]","We are thankful to N.

Here we show that these long tethers do not retract as postulated(6,7), but instead persist and appear as 'slings' at the front of rolling cells. We demonstrate slings in a model of acute inflammationin vivo and on P-selectin in vitro, where P-selectin-glycoprotein-ligand-1 (PSGL-1) is found in discrete sticky patches whereas LFA-1 is expressed over the entire length on slings. As neutrophils roll forward, slings wrap around the rolling cells and undergo a step-wise peeling from the P-selectin substrate enabled by the failure of PSGL-1 patches under hydrodynamic forces. The 'step-wise peeling of slings' is distinct from the 'pulling of tethers' reported previously(4-6,8).

These enzymes demethylate lysine residues in histones in a methylation-state and sequence-specific context(5). Considerable effort has been devoted to gaining a mechanistic understanding of the roles of histone lysine demethylases in eukaryotic transcription, genome integrity and epigenetic inheritance(2,4,6), as well as in development, physiology and disease(3,7). However, because of the absence of any selective inhibitors, the relevance of the demethylase activity of JMJ enzymes in regulating cellular responses remains poorly understood. Here we present a structure-guided small-molecule and chemoproteomics approach to elucidating the functional role of the H3K27me3-specific demethylase subfamily (KDM6 subfamily members JMJD3 and UTX)(8). The liganded structures of human and mouse JMJD3 provide novel insight into the specificity determinants for cofactor, substrate and inhibitor recognition by the KDM6 subfamily of demethylases. We exploited these structural features to generate the first small-molecule catalytic site inhibitor that is selective for the H3K27me3-specific JMJ subfamily. We demonstrate that this inhibitor binds in a novel manner and reduces lipopolysaccharide-induced proinflammatory cytokine production by human primary macrophages, a process that depends on both JMJD3 and UTX. Our results resolve the ambiguity associated with the catalytic function of H3K27-specific JMJs in regulating disease-relevant inflammatory responses and provide encouragement for designing small-molecule inhibitors to allow selective pharmacological intervention across the JMJ family.","[Kruidenier, Laurens; Liddle, John; Diallo, Hawa; Mander, Palwinder K.; Ramirez-Molina, Cesar; Sheppard, Robert J.; Smith, Julia E.; Lee, Kevin; Wilson, David M.] GlaxoSmithKline R&D, Med Res Ctr, Immunoinflammat Therapy Area, Epinova DPU, Stevenage SG1 2NY, Herts, England; [Chung, Chun-wa; Bridges, Angela; Hutchinson, Sue; Jones, Emma; Katso, Roy; Leveridge, Melanie; Mosley, Julie; Rowland, Paul; Tanner, Robert; Thomas, Pamela] GlaxoSmithKline R&D, Med Res Ctr, Platform Technol & Sci, Stevenage SG1 2NY, Herts, England; [Cheng, Zhongjun; Patel, Dinshaw J.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Che, KaHing; Bountra, Chas; Schofield, Christopher J.; Tumber, Anthony; Oppermann, Udo] Univ Oxford, Struct Genom Consortium, Headington OX3 7DQ, England; [Che, KaHing; Swales, Catherine; Oppermann, Udo] Univ Oxford, NIHR Biomed Res Unit, Botnar Res Ctr, Oxford OX3 7LD, England; [Joberty, Gerard; Bantscheff, Marcus; Eberhard, Dirk; Drewes, Gerard] Cellzome AG, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany","Wilson, DM (reprint author), GlaxoSmithKline R&D, Med Res Ctr, Immunoinflammat Therapy Area, Epinova DPU, Gunnels Wood Rd, Stevenage SG1 2NY, Herts, England.",david.m.wilson@gsk.com,,"Schofield, Christopher/0000-0002-0290-6565","Starr Foundation; Abby Rockefeller Mauze Trust; Maloris Foundation; Canadian Institutes for Health Research; Canada Foundation for Innovation; Genome Canada; GlaxoSmithKline; Lilly Canada; Novartis Research Foundation; Pfizer; Takeda; Ontario Ministry of Economic Development and Innovation; Wellcome Trust; National Institute for Health and Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Unit, Oxford","We thank the following colleagues for their help and advice in preparing the manuscript: A.

This process is accompanied by genome-wide epigenetic changes(2-5), but how these chromatin modifications are biochemically determined requires further investigation. Here we show in mice and humans that the histone H3 methylated Lys 27(H3K27) demethylase Utx(6-9) (also known as Kdm6a) regulates the efficient induction, rather than maintenance, of pluripotency. Murine embryonic stem cells lacking Utx can execute lineage commitment and contribute to adult chimaeric animals; however, somatic cells lacking Utx fail to robustly reprogram back to the ground state of pluripotency. Utx directly partners with OSK reprogramming factors and uses its histone demethylase catalytic activity to facilitate iPSC formation. Genomic analysis indicates that Utx depletion results in aberrant dynamics of H3K27me3 repressive chromatin demethylation in somatic cells undergoing reprogramming. The latter directly hampers the derepression of potent pluripotency promoting gene modules (including Sall1, Sall4 and Utf1), which can cooperatively substitute for exogenous OSK supplementation in iPSC formation. Remarkably, Utx safeguards the timely execution of H3K27me3 demethylation observed in embryonic day 10.5-11 primordial germcells (PGCs)(10), and Utx-deficientPGCs show cell-autonomous aberrant epigenetic reprogramming dynamics during their embryonic maturation in vivo. Subsequently, this disrupts PGC development by embryonic day 12.5, and leads to diminished germline transmission in mouse chimaeras generated from Utx-knockout pluripotent cells. Thus, we identify Utx as a novel mediator with distinct functions during the re-establishment of pluripotency and germ cell development. Furthermore, our findings highlight the principle that molecular regulators mediating loss of repressive chromatin during in vivo germ cell reprogramming can be co-opted during in vitro reprogramming towards ground state pluripotency.","[Mansour, Abed AlFatah; Gafni, Ohad; Weinberger, Leehee; Zviran, Asaf; Rais, Yoach; Krupalnik, Vladislav; Zerbib, Mirie; Maza, Itay; Geula, Shay; Viukov, Sergey; Holtzman, Liad; Pribluda, Ariel; Novershtern, Noa; Hanna, Jacob H.] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Mol Genet, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Ayyash, Muneef] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Biol Chem, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Amann-Zalcenstein, Daniela; Amit, Ido] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Immunol, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Amann-Zalcenstein, Daniela; Horn-Saban, Shirley] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Biol Serv, Genom Unit, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Canaani, Eli] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Mol Cell Biol, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel","Hanna, JH (reprint author), Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Mol Genet, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel.",noa.novershtern@weizmann.ac.il; jacob.hanna@weizmann.ac.il,"HANNA, JACOB/K-1339-2012","HANNA, JACOB/0000-0003-2042-9974; Novershtern, Noa/0000-0002-2244-6877; Geula, Shay/0000-0001-8111-4410; Mansour, Abed AlFatah/0000-0001-9025-6998","ERC starting investigator grant [StG-2011-281906]; Israel Science Foundation Regular and Bikura research grants; ICRF Foundation; Fritz Thyssen Stiftung; Alon Foundation; E.

Enzymes known as sulphydryl oxidases catalysede novo disulphide formation and initiate intra-and intermolecular dithiol/disulphide relays to deliver the disulphides to substrate proteins(1,2). Quiescin sulphydryl oxidase (QSOX) is a unique, multi-domain disulphide catalyst that is localized primarily to the Golgi apparatus and secreted fluids(3) and has attracted attention owing to its overproduction in tumours(4,5). In addition to its physiological importance, QSOX is a mechanistically intriguing enzyme, encompassing functions typically carried out by a series of proteins in other disulphide-formation pathways. How disulphides are relayed through the multiple redox-active sites of QSOX and whether there is a functional benefit to concatenating these sites on a single polypeptide are open questions. Here we present the first crystal structure of an intact QSOX enzyme, derived from a trypanosome parasite. Notably, sequential sites in the disulphide relay were found more than 40 angstrom apart in this structure, too far for direct disulphide transfer. To resolve this puzzle, we trapped and crystallized an intermediate in the disulphide hand-off, which showed a 165 degrees domain rotation relative to the original structure, bringing the two active sites within disulphide-bonding distance. The comparable structure of a mammalian QSOX enzyme, also presented here, shows further biochemical features that facilitate disulphide transfer in metazoan orthologues. Finally, we quantified the contribution of concatenation to QSOX activity, providing general lessons for the understanding of multi-domain enzymes and the design of new catalytic relays.","[Alon, Assaf; Grossman, Iris; Gat, Yair; Fass, Deborah] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Biol Struct, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Kodali, Vamsi K.; Thorpe, Colin] Univ Delaware, Dept Chem & Biochem, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [DiMaio, Frank; Baker, David] Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Mehlman, Tevie] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Biol Res Support, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Haran, Gilad] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Chem Phys, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel","Fass, D (reprint author), Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Biol Struct, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel.",deborah.fass@weizmann.ac.il,"FIP, BM30A/I-5166-2015; HARAN, GILAD/K-1489-2012; Baker, David/K-8941-2012; Kodali, Vamsi/A-8530-2010","Baker, David/0000-0001-7896-6217; Kodali, Vamsi/0000-0001-8941-9761",Israel Science Foundation; Kimmelman Center for Macromolecular Assemblies; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [GM26643]; NIH [P41 RR001081],"S.

In most studies so far, the design of such structures has been based on the judicious manipulation of their refractive index properties. Recently, the prospect of simultaneously using gain and loss was suggested as a new way of achieving optical behaviour that is at present unattainable with standard arrangements. What facilitated these quests is the recently developed notion of 'parity-time symmetry' in optical systems, which allows a controlled interplay between gain and loss. Here we report the experimental observation of light transport in large-scale temporal lattices that are parity-time symmetric. In addition, we demonstrate that periodic structures respecting this symmetry can act as unidirectional invisible media when operated near their exceptional points. Our experimental results represent a step in the application of concepts from parity-time symmetry to a new generation of multifunctional optical devices and networks.","[Regensburger, Alois; Bersch, Christoph; Peschel, Ulf] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Inst Opt Informat & Photon, D-91058 Erlangen, Germany; [Regensburger, Alois; Bersch, Christoph; Onishchukov, Georgy] Max Planck Inst Sci Light, D-91058 Erlangen, Germany; [Miri, Mohammad-Ali; Christodoulides, Demetrios N.] Univ Cent Florida, Coll Opt & Photon, CREOL, Orlando, FL 32816 USA","Peschel, U (reprint author), Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Inst Opt Informat & Photon, Staudtstr 7-B2, D-91058 Erlangen, Germany.",demetri@creol.ucf.edu; ulf.peschel@physik.uni-erlangen.de,"Miri, Mohammad-Ali/F-8202-2012; Peschel, Ulf/C-3356-2013","Regensburger, Alois/0000-0003-3273-2751","DFG [Forschergruppe 760]; Cluster of Excellence Engineering of Advanced Materials, SAOT; German-Israeli Foundation; NSF [ECCS-1128520]; AFOSR [FA95501210148]","We acknowledge financial support from DFG Forschergruppe 760, the Cluster of Excellence Engineering of Advanced Materials, SAOT and the German-Israeli Foundation.

These behaviours are rapidly recapitulated by activation of starvation-sensitive AGRP neurons, which present an entry point for reverse-engineering neural circuits for hunger. Here we mapped synaptic interactions of AGRP neurons with multiple cell populations in mice and probed the contribution of these distinct circuits to feeding behaviour using optogenetic and pharmacogenetic techniques. An inhibitory circuit with paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH) neurons substantially accounted for acute AGRP neuron-evoked eating, whereas two other prominent circuits were insufficient. Within the PVH, we found that AGRP neurons target and inhibit oxytocin neurons, a small population that is selectively lost in Prader-Willi syndrome, a condition involving insatiable hunger. By developing strategies for evaluating molecularly defined circuits, we show that AGRP neuron suppression of oxytocin neurons is critical for evoked feeding. These experiments reveal a new neural circuit that regulates hunger state and pathways associated with overeating disorders.","[Atasoy, Deniz; Betley, J.

Here we show that the faecal microbiota composition from 178 elderly subjects formed groups, correlating with residence location in the community, day-hospital, rehabilitation or in long-term residential care. However, clustering of subjects by diet separated them by the same residence location and microbiota groupings. The separation of microbiota composition significantly correlated with measures of frailty, co-morbidity, nutritional status, markers of inflammation and with metabolites in faecal water. The individual microbiota of people in long-stay care was significantly less diverse than that of community dwellers. Loss of community-associated microbiota correlated with increased frailty.

It can be achieved with the help of long-distance quantum teleportation(1,2) and entanglement distribution. The latter is also important for fundamental tests of the laws of quantum mechanics(3,4). Although quantum teleportation(5,6) and entanglement distribution(7-9) over moderate distances have been realized using optical fibre links, the huge photon loss and decoherence in fibres necessitate the use of quantum repeaters(10) for larger distances. However, the practical realization of quantum repeaters remains experimentally challenging(11). Free-space channels, first used for quantum key distribution(12,13), offer a more promising approach because photon loss and decoherence are almost negligible in the atmosphere. Furthermore, by using satellites, ultra-long-distance quantum communication and tests of quantum foundations could be achieved on a global scale. Previous experiments have achieved free-space distribution of entangled photon pairs over distances of 600 metres (ref. 14) and 13 kilometres (ref. 15), and transfer of triggered single photons over a 144-kilometre one-link free-space channel(16). Most recently, following a modified scheme(17), free-space quantum teleportation over 16 kilometres was demonstrated(18) with a single pair of entangled photons. Here we report quantum teleportation of independent qubits over a 97-kilometre one-link free-space channel with multi-photon entanglement. An average fidelity of 80.4 +/- 0.9 per cent is achieved for six distinct states. Furthermore, we demonstrate entanglement distribution over a two-link channel, in which the entangled photons are separated by 101.8 kilometres. Violation of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality(4) is observed without the locality loophole. Besides being of fundamental interest, our results represent an important step towards a global quantum network. Moreover, the high-frequency and high-accuracy acquiring, pointing and tracking technique developed in our experiment can be directly used for future satellite-based quantum communication and large-scale tests of quantum foundations.","[Yin, Juan; Ren, Ji-Gang; Lu, He; Cao, Yuan; Yong, Hai-Lin; Wu, Yu-Ping; Liu, Chang; Liao, Sheng-Kai; Zhou, Fei; Jiang, Yan; Cai, Xin-Dong; Xu, Ping; Pan, Ge-Sheng; Yin, Hao; Chen, Yu-Ao; Peng, Cheng-Zhi; Pan, Jian-Wei] Univ Sci & Technol China, Natl Lab Phys Sci Microscale, Shanghai Branch, Shanghai 201315, Peoples R China; [Yin, Juan; Ren, Ji-Gang; Lu, He; Cao, Yuan; Yong, Hai-Lin; Wu, Yu-Ping; Liu, Chang; Liao, Sheng-Kai; Zhou, Fei; Jiang, Yan; Cai, Xin-Dong; Xu, Ping; Pan, Ge-Sheng; Yin, Hao; Chen, Yu-Ao; Peng, Cheng-Zhi; Pan, Jian-Wei] Univ Sci & Technol China, Dept Modern Phys, Shanghai 201315, Peoples R China; [Jia, Jian-Jun; Wang, Jian-Yu] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Tech Phys, Shanghai 200083, Peoples R China; [Huang, Yong-Mei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Opt & Elect, Chengdu 610209, Peoples R China","Chen, YA (reprint author), Univ Sci & Technol China, Natl Lab Phys Sci Microscale, Shanghai Branch, Shanghai 201315, Peoples R China.",yuaochen@ustc.edu.cn; pcz@ustc.edu.cn; pan@ustc.edu.cn,"Chen, Yu-Ao/B-2057-2013; Cai, Xin-Dong/J-9496-2013; Pan, Jian-Wei/A-2332-2010","Pan, Jian-Wei/0000-0002-6100-5142; Yong, Hai-Lin/0000-0002-9074-5617",Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Fundamental Research Program [2011CB921300],"We are grateful to the staff of the Qinghai Lake National Natural Reserve Utilization Administration Bureau, especially Y.-B.

The trend in transistor scaling has already led to a change in gate structure from two dimensions to three, used in fin field-effect transistors, to avoid problems inherent in miniaturization such as high off-state leakage current and the short-channel effect. At present, planar and fin architectures using III-V materials, specifically InGaAs, are being explored as alternative fast channels on silicon(5-9) because of their high electron mobility and high-quality interface with gate dielectrics(10). The idea of surrounding-gate transistors(11), in which the gate is wrapped around a nanowire channel to provide the best possible electrostatic gate control, using InGaAs channels on silicon, however, has been less well investigated(12,13) because of difficulties in integrating free-standing InGaAs nanostructures on silicon. Here we report the position-controlled growth of vertical InGaAs nanowires on silicon without any buffering technique and demonstrate surrounding-gate transistors using InGaAs nanowires and InGaAs/InP/InAlAs/InGaAs core-multishell nanowires as channels. Surrounding-gate transistors using core-multishell nanowire channels with a six-sided, high-electron-mobility transistor structure greatly enhance the on-state current and transconductance while keeping good gate controllability. These devices provide a route to making vertically oriented transistors for the next generation of field-effect transistors and may be useful as building blocks for wireless networks on silicon platforms.","[Tomioka, Katsuhiro; Yoshimura, Masatoshi; Fukui, Takashi] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608628, Japan; [Tomioka, Katsuhiro; Yoshimura, Masatoshi; Fukui, Takashi] Hokkaido Univ, RCIQE, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608628, Japan; [Tomioka, Katsuhiro] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy PRESTO, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan","Tomioka, K (reprint author), Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Kita 13 Nishi 8, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608628, Japan.",tomioka@rciqe.hokudai.ac.jp,"Fukui, Takashi/A-5261-2012; Tomioka, Katsuhiro/A-2815-2014; Tomioka, Katsuhiro/N-9611-2015","Tomioka, Katsuhiro/0000-0002-5780-7783",MEXT; Japan Science and Technology Agency - PRESTO programme,"We thank J.

Ozone, the hydroxyl radical and the nitrate radical are generally considered to be the dominant oxidants that initiate the removal of trace gases, including pollutants, from the atmosphere. Here we present atmospheric observations from a boreal forest region in Finland, supported by laboratory experiments and theoretical considerations, that allow us to identify another compound, probably a stabilized Criegee intermediate (a carbonyl oxide with two free-radical sites) or its derivative, which has a significant capacity to oxidize sulphur dioxide and potentially other trace gases. This compound probably enhances the reactivity of the atmosphere, particularly with regard to the production of sulphuric acid, and consequently atmospheric aerosol formation. Our findings suggest that this new atmospherically relevant oxidation route is important relative to oxidation by the hydroxyl radical, at least at moderate concentrations of that radical. We also find that the oxidation chemistry of this compound seems to be tightly linked to the presence of alkenes of biogenic origin.","[Mauldin, R.

H.",,,Water balance of global aquifers revealed by groundwater footprint,NATURE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,HUMAN APPROPRIATION; RESOURCES,"Groundwater is a life-sustaining resource that supplies water to billions of people, plays a central part in irrigated agriculture and influences the health of many ecosystems(1,2). Most assessments of global water resources have focused on surface water(3-6), but unsustainable depletion of groundwater has recently been documented on both regional(7,8) and global scales(9-11). It remains unclear how the rate of global groundwater depletion compares to the rate of natural renewal and the supply needed to support ecosystems. Here we define the groundwater footprint (the area required to sustain groundwater use and groundwater-dependent ecosystem services) and show that humans are overexploiting groundwater in many large aquifers that are critical to agriculture, especially in Asia and North America. We estimate that the size of the global groundwater footprint is currently about 3.5 times the actual area of aquifers and that about 1.7 billion people live in areas where groundwater resources and/or groundwater-dependent ecosystems are under threat. That said, 80 per cent of aquifers have a groundwater footprint that is less than their area, meaning that the net global value is driven by a few heavily overexploited aquifers. The groundwater footprint is the first tool suitable for consistently evaluating the use, renewal and ecosystem requirements of groundwater at an aquifer scale. It can be combined with the water footprint and virtual water calculations(12-14), and be used to assess the potential for increasing agricultural yields with renewable groundwaterref(15). The method could be modified to evaluate other resources with renewal rates that are slow and spatially heterogeneous, such as fisheries, forestry or soil.","[Gleeson, Tom] McGill Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Montreal, PQ H3A 0C3, Canada; [Wada, Yoshihide; Bierkens, Marc F.

KNM-ER 1470 stands out among other specimens attributed to early Homo because of its larger size, and its flat and subnasally orthognathic face with anteriorly placed maxillary zygomatic roots(3). This singular morphology and the incomplete preservation of the fossil have led to different views as to whether KNM-ER 1470 can be accommodated within a single species of early Homo that is highly variable because of sexual, geographical and temporal factors(4-9), or whether it provides evidence of species diversity marked by differences in cranial size and facial or masticatory adaptation(3,10-20). Here we report on three newly discovered fossils, aged between 1.78 and 1.95 million years (Myr) old, that clarify the anatomy and taxonomic status of KNM-ER 1470. KNM-ER 62000, a well-preserved face of a late juvenile hominin, closely resembles KNM-ER 1470 but is notably smaller. It preserves previously unknown morphology, including moderately sized, mesiodistally long postcanine teeth. The nearly complete mandible KNM-ER 60000 and mandibular fragment KNM-ER 62003 have a dental arcade that is short anteroposteriorly and flat across the front, with small incisors; these features are consistent with the arcade morphology of KNM-ER 1470 and KNM-ER 62000. The new fossils confirm the presence of two contemporary species of early Homo, in addition to Homo erectus, in the early Pleistocene of eastern Africa.","[Leakey, Meave G.; Kiarie, Christopher; Leakey, Louise N.] Turkana Basin Inst, Nairobi 00502, Kenya; [Leakey, Meave G.; Leakey, Louise N.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Anthropol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Spoor, Fred] Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Anthropol, Dept Human Evolut, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Spoor, Fred; Dean, M.

Several major issues remain outstanding, such as whether snakes originated in a marine(2-4) or terrestrial(5,6) environment and how their unique feeding mechanism evolved(1,7,8). The Cretaceous Coniophis precedens was among the first Mesozoic snakes discovered(9), but until now only an isolated vertebra has been described(9,10) and it has therefore been overlooked in discussions of snake evolution. Here we report on previously undescribed material(11) from this ancient snake, including the maxilla, dentary and additional vertebrae. Coniophis is not an anilioid as previously thought(11); a revised phylogenetic analysis of Ophidia shows that it instead represents the most primitive known snake. Accordingly, its morphology and ecology are critical to understanding snake evolution. Coniophis occurs in a continental floodplain environment, consistent with a terrestrial rather than a marine origin; furthermore, its small size and reduced neural spines indicate fossorial habits, suggesting that snakes evolved from burrowing lizards. The skull is intermediate between that of lizards and snakes. Hooked teeth and an intramandibular joint indicate that Coniophis fed on relatively large, soft-bodied prey. However, the maxilla is firmly united with the skull, indicating an akinetic rostrum. Coniophis therefore represents a transitional snake, combining a snake-like body and a lizard-like head. Subsequent to the evolution of a serpentine body and carnivory, snakes evolved a highly specialized, kinetic skull, which was followed by a major adaptive radiation in the Early Cretaceous period. This pattern suggests that the kinetic skull was a key innovation that permitted the diversification of snakes.","[Longrich, Nicholas R.; Gauthier, Jacques A.] Yale Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Bhullar, Bhart-Anjan S.] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Biol Labs, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Longrich, NR (reprint author), Yale Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, POB 208109, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",nicholas.longrich@yale.edu,,,US NSF [DEB-0132227]; Yale Institute for Biospheric Studies,"We thank the curators and staff of the American Museum of Natural History, the University of California Museum of Paleontology and the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History, and the staff of Digimorph at the University of Texas at Austin, for specimen access.

Although different types of uncertainty limit our capacity to assess this risk(2), Earth system scientists are particularly concerned about tipping elements, large-scale components of the Earth system that can be switched into qualitatively different states by small perturbations. Despite growing evidence that tipping elements exist in the climate system(1,3), whether large-scale vegetation systems can tip into alternative states is poorly understood(4). Here we show that tropical grassland, savanna and forest ecosystems, areas large enough to have powerful impacts on the Earth system, are likely to shift to alternative states. Specifically, we show that increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration will force transitions to vegetation states characterized by higher biomass and/or woody-plant dominance. The timing of these critical transitions varies as a result of between-site variance in the rate of temperature increase, as well as a dependence on stochastic variation in fire severity and rainfall. We further show that the locations of bistable vegetation zones (zones where alternative vegetation states can exist) will shift as climate changes. We conclude that even though large-scale directional regime shifts in terrestrial ecosystems are likely, asynchrony in the timing of these shifts may serve to dampen, but not nullify, the shock that these changes may represent to the Earth system.","[Higgins, Steven I.] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Phys Geog, Altenhoferallee 1, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany; [Scheiter, Simon] Senckenberg Gesell Nat Forsch, Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr BiK F, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany","Higgins, SI (reprint author), Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Phys Geog, Altenhoferallee 1, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany.",higgins@em.uni-frankfurt.de,"Scheiter, Simon/G-5048-2012; Higgins, Steven/A-5138-2012","Higgins, Steven/0000-0001-5695-9665",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Hesse's Landes-Offensive zur Entwicklung Wissenschaftlich-okonomischer Exzellenz (LOEWE) programme,We thank D.

Bananas are vital for food security in many tropical and subtropical countries and the most popular fruit in industrialized countries(1). The Musa domestication process started some 7,000 years ago in Southeast Asia. It involved hybridizations between diverse species and subspecies, fostered by human migrations(2), and selection of diploid and triploid seedless, parthenocarpic hybrids thereafter widely dispersed by vegetative propagation. Half of the current production relies on somaclones derived from a single triploid genotype (Cavendish)(1). Pests and diseases have gradually become adapted, representing an imminent danger for global banana production(3,4). Here we describe the draft sequence of the 523-megabase genome of a Musa acuminata doubled-haploid genotype, providing a crucial stepping-stone for genetic improvement of banana. We detected three rounds of whole-genome duplications in the Musa lineage, independently of those previously described in the Poales lineage and the one we detected in the Arecales lineage. This first monocotyledon high-continuity whole-genome sequence reported outside Poales represents an essential bridge for comparative genome analysis in plants. As such, it clarifies commelinid-monocotyledon phylogenetic relationships, reveals Poaceae-specific features and has led to the discovery of conserved noncoding sequences predating monocotyledon-eudicotyledon divergence.","[D'Hont, Angelique; Baurens, Franc-Christophe; Carreel, Francoise; Garsmeur, Olivier; Bocs, Stephanie; Droc, Gaetan; Cardi, Celine; Souquet, Marlene; Jourda, Cyril; Lengelle, Juliette; Rodier-Goud, Marguerite; Rivallan, Ronan; Francois, Philippe; Poiron, Claire; Burthia, Dheema; Jenny, Christophe; Bakry, Frederic; Guignon, Valentin; Joseph, Steeve; Dievart, Anne; Leclercq, Julie; Argout, Xavier; Jeridi, Mouna; Risterucci, Ange-Marie; Ruiz, Manuel; Glaszmann, Jean-Christophe; Yahiaoui, Nabila] Ctr Cooperat Int Rech Agron Dev CIRAD, UMR AGAP, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Denoeud, France; Aury, Jean-Marc; Noel, Benjamin; Da Silva, Corinne; Jabbari, Kamel; Poulain, Julie; Labadie, Karine; Alberti, Adriana; Bernard, Maria; Correa, Margot; Jaillon, Olivier; Weissenbach, Jean; Wincker, Patrick] CEA, IG, F-91057 Evry, France; [Denoeud, France; Jabbari, Kamel; Jaillon, Olivier; Weissenbach, Jean; Wincker, Patrick] CNRS, UMR 8030, Evry, France; [Denoeud, France; Jabbari, Kamel; Jaillon, Olivier; Weissenbach, Jean; Wincker, Patrick] Univ Evry, UMR 8030, Evry, France; [Carreel, Francoise; Chabannes, Matthieu; Habas, Remy] CIRAD, UMR BGPI, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Rouard, Mathieu; Guignon, Valentin; Roux, Nicolas] Biovers Int, F-34397 Montpellier 5, France; [Ayyampalayam, Saravanaraj; Mckain, Michael R.; Leebens-Mack, Jim] Univ Georgia, Dept Plant Biol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Burgess, Diane; Freeling, Mike; Almeida, Ana] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Plant & Microbial Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Mbeguie-A-Mbeguie, Didier] CIRAD, UMR QUALISUD Stn Neufchateau, F-97130 Capesterre Belle Eau, France; [Wicker, Thomas] Univ Zurich, Inst Plant Biol, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland; [Panaud, Olivier; Barbosa, Jose] UMR 5096 CNRS UPVD, Lab Genome & Dev Plantes, F-66000 Perpignan, France; [Hribova, Eva] Ctr Reg Hana Biotechnol & Agr Res, Inst Expt Bot, CZ-77200 Olomouc, Czech Republic; [Heslop-Harrison, Pat] Univ Leicester, Dept Biol, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; [Kilian, Andrzej] Divers Arrays Technol, Yarralumla, ACT 2600, Australia; [Brown, Spencer] CNRS, UPR 2355, Inst Sci Vegetal, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Brown, Spencer] FRC3115, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Guignon, Valentin; Kema, Gert; Waalwijk, Cees] Univ Wageningen, Plant Res Int, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Lyons, Eric] Univ Arizona, Dept Plant Sci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Quetier, Francis] Univ Evry Val dEssonne, Dept Biol, Evry, France; [Dita, Miguel] Brazilian Agr Res Corp EMBRAPA, Embrapa Cassava & Fruits, BR-44380000 Salvador, BA, Brazil","D'Hont, A (reprint author), Ctr Cooperat Int Rech Agron Dev CIRAD, UMR AGAP, F-34398 Montpellier, France.",angelique.d'hont@cirad.fr; pwincker@genoscope.cns.fr,"; BAKRY, Frederic/I-4857-2012; Leclercq, Julie/B-2147-2012; BROWN, Spencer/B-6878-2014; Dolezel, Jaroslav/B-7716-2008; hribova, eva/F-7291-2014; Heslop-Harrison, JS/C-9207-2009; Poiron, Claire/M-7895-2015; Alberti, Adriana/E-7142-2017; Rouard, Mathieu/H-5035-2017","BAURENS, Franc-Christophe/0000-0002-5219-8771; AURY, Jean-Marc/0000-0003-1718-3010; Dolezel, Jaroslav/0000-0002-6263-0492; Heslop-Harrison, JS/0000-0002-3105-2167; Poiron, Claire/0000-0002-3995-1343; Alberti, Adriana/0000-0003-3372-9423; Rouard, Mathieu/0000-0003-0284-1885; Jenny, Christophe/0000-0001-6165-6888; Droc, Gaetan/0000-0003-1849-1269; Quetier, Francis/0000-0003-4388-9287",French National Research Agency; Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique; Centre de cooperation Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Developpement,"This work was mainly supported by French National Research Agency, Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique and Centre de cooperation Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Developpement.

The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), which lies on the medial surface of the frontal lobes, is important in regulating cognitive control. Hypotheses about its function include guiding reward-based decision making(1), monitoring for conflict between competing responses(2) and predicting task difficulty(3). Precise mechanisms of dACC function remain unknown, however, because of the limited number of human neurophysiological studies. Here we use functional imaging and human single-neuron recordings to show that the firing of individual dACC neurons encodes current and recent cognitive load. We demonstrate that the modulation of current dACC activity by previous activity produces a behavioural adaptation that accelerates reactions to cues of similar difficulty to previous ones, and retards reactions to cues of different difficulty. Furthermore, this conflict adaptation, or Gratton effect(2,4), is abolished after surgically targeted ablation of the dACC. Our results demonstrate that the dACC provides a continuously updated prediction of expected cognitive demand to optimize future behavioural responses. In situations with stable cognitive demands, this signal promotes efficiency by hastening responses, but in situations with changing demands it engenders accuracy by delaying responses.","[Sheth, Sameer A.; Mian, Matthew K.; Patel, Shaun R.; Williams, Ziv M.; Eskandar, Emad N.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Neurosurg, Nayef Al Rodhan Labs, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Patel, Shaun R.] Boston Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02118 USA; [Asaad, Wael F.] Brown Univ, Alpert Med Sch, Dept Neurosurg, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Asaad, Wael F.] Rhode Isl Hosp, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Dougherty, Darin D.; Bush, George] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Boston, MA 02114 USA","Eskandar, EN (reprint author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Neurosurg, Nayef Al Rodhan Labs, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",eeskandar@partners.org,"Asaad, Wael/I-8485-2012","Asaad, Wael/0000-0003-4406-9096","National Science Foundation [IOB 0645886]; National Institutes of Health [NEI 1R01EY017658-01A1, NIDA 1R01NS063249, MH086400, R25 NS065743]; Klingenstein Foundation; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Sackler Scholar Programme in Psychobiology; Centers for Disease Control [5 R01 DP000339]; Benson-Henry Institute at Massachusetts General Hospital for Mind-Body Medicine; David Judah Fund; McIngvale Fund; Center for Functional Neuroimaging Technologies [P41RR14075]","This work was supported by grants from the National Science Foundation (IOB 0645886), the National Institutes of Health (NEI 1R01EY017658-01A1, NIDA 1R01NS063249, NIMH Conte Award MH086400 and R25 NS065743), the Klingenstein Foundation, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the Sackler Scholar Programme in Psychobiology, the Centers for Disease Control (5 R01 DP000339), the Benson-Henry Institute at Massachusetts General Hospital for Mind-Body Medicine, the David Judah Fund, the McIngvale Fund, and the Center for Functional Neuroimaging Technologies (P41RR14075).",,29,145,146,3,51,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,9-Aug,2012,488,7410,,,,,218,+,,10.1038/nature11239,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,985LE,WOS:000307267000035,22722841.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,emad n.,eskandar,na,na,na,na,na

HVEM was recently reported as a colitis risk locus in patients(2), and in a mouse model of colitis we demonstrated an anti-inflammatory role for HVEM3, but its mechanism of action in the mucosal immune system was unknown. Here we report an important role for epithelial HVEM in innate mucosal defence against pathogenic bacteria. HVEM enhances immune responses by NF-kappa B-inducing kinase-dependent Stat3 activation, which promotes the epithelial expression of genes important for immunity. During intestinal Citrobacter rodentium infection(4-6), a mouse model for enteropathogenic Escherichia coli infection, Hvem(-/-) mice showed decreased Stat3 activation, impaired responses in the colon, higher bacterial burdens and increased mortality. We identified the immunoglobulin superfamily molecule CD160 (refs 7 and 8), expressed predominantly by innate-like intraepithelial lymphocytes, as the ligand engaging epithelial HVEM for host protection. Likewise, in pulmonary Streptococcus pneumoniae infection(9), HVEM is also required for host defence. Our results pinpoint HVEM as an important orchestrator of mucosal immunity, integrating signals from innate lymphocytes to induce optimal epithelial Stat3 activation, which indicates that targeting HVEM with agonists could improve host defence.","[Shui, Jr-Wen; Larange, Alexandre; Kim, Gisen; Vela, Jose Luis; Zahner, Sonja; Cheroutre, Hilde; Kronenberg, Mitchell] La Jolla Inst Allergy & Immunol, Div Dev Immunol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Kronenberg, M (reprint author), La Jolla Inst Allergy & Immunol, Div Dev Immunol, 9420 Athena Circle, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",mitch@liai.org,,,"National Institutes of Health [RO1-AI061516, PO1 DK46763, F32-DK082249, F32-AI083029]; La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology; Center for Infectious Disease [LIAI-JAN-2011-CID]","This work was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (RO1-AI061516 to M.

Although many cells are removed through caspase-mediated apoptosis followed by phagocytosis by engulfing cells(2), other mechanisms of cell elimination occur(3), including the extrusion of cells from epithelia through a poorly understood, possibly caspase-independent, process(4). Here we identify a mechanism of cell extrusion that is caspase independent and that can eliminate a subset of the Caenorhabditis elegans cells programmed to die during embryonic development. In wild-type animals, these cells die soon after their generation through caspase-mediated apoptosis. However, in mutants lacking all four C. elegans caspase genes, these cells are eliminated by being extruded from the developing embryo into the extra-embryonic space of the egg. The shed cells show apoptosis-like cytological and morphological characteristics, indicating that apoptosis can occur in the absence of caspases in C. elegans. We describe a kinase pathway required for cell extrusion involving PAR-4, STRD-1 and MOP-25.1/-25.2, the C. elegans homologues of the mammalian tumour-suppressor kinase LKB1 and its binding partners STRAD alpha and MO25 alpha. The AMPK-related kinase PIG-1, a possible target of the PAR-4-STRD-1-MOP-25 kinase complex, is also required for cell shedding. PIG-1 promotes shed-cell detachment by preventing the cell-surface expression of cell-adhesion molecules. Our findings reveal a mechanism for apoptotic cell elimination that is fundamentally distinct from that of canonical programmed cell death.","[Denning, Daniel P.; Hatch, Victoria; Horvitz, H.

Some ncRNAs are processed by DICER and DROSHA RNases to give rise to small double-stranded RNAs involved in RNA interference (RNAi)(2). The DNA-damage response (DDR) is a signalling pathway that originates from a DNA lesion and arrests cell proliferation(3). So far, DICER and DROSHA RNA products have not been reported to control DDR activation. Here we show, in human, mouse and zebrafish, that DICER and DROSHA, but not downstream elements of the RNAi pathway, are necessary to activate the DDR upon exogenous DNA damage and oncogene-induced genotoxic stress, as studied by DDR foci formation and by checkpoint assays. DDR foci are sensitive to RNase A treatment, and DICER-and DROSHA-dependent RNA products are required to restore DDR foci in RNase-A-treated cells. Through RNA deep sequencing and the study of DDR activation at a single inducible DNA double-strand break, we demonstrate that DDR foci formation requires site-specific DICER- and DROSHA-dependent small RNAs, named DDRNAs, which act in a MRE11-RAD50-NBS1-complex-dependent manner (MRE11 also known as MRE11A; NBS1 also known as NBN). DDRNAs, either chemically synthesized or in vitro generated by DICER cleavage, are sufficient to restore the DDR in RNase-A-treated cells, also in the absence of other cellular RNAs. Our results describe an unanticipated direct role of a novel class of ncRNAs in the control of DDR activation at sites of DNA damage.","[Francia, Sofia; Michelini, Flavia; Anelli, Viviana; Mione, Marina; di Fagagna, Fabrizio d'Adda] IFOM Fdn FIRC Inst Mol Oncol Fdn, I-20139 Milan, Italy; [Francia, Sofia] Ist Italiano Tecnol, IIT SEMM, Center Genom Sci, I-20139 Milan, Italy; [Saxena, Alka; Tang, Dave; de Hoon, Michiel; Carninci, Piero] RIKEN Yokohama Inst, Om Sci Ctr, Tsurumi Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [di Fagagna, Fabrizio d'Adda] CNR, Ist Genet Mol, I-27100 Pavia, Italy","di Fagagna, FD (reprint author), IFOM Fdn FIRC Inst Mol Oncol Fdn, Via Adamello 16, I-20139 Milan, Italy.",fabrizio.dadda@ifom-ieo-campus.it,"de Hoon, Michiel/A-6443-2013; Mione, Maria Caterina /I-3073-2013; Tang, Dave/G-9670-2014; Carninci, Piero/K-1568-2014; de Hoon, Michiel/N-8006-2015","Tang, Dave/0000-0002-4790-9014; Carninci, Piero/0000-0001-7202-7243; DADDADIFAGAGNA, FABRIZIO/0000-0002-1976-3185; Hoon, Dave/0000-0003-1915-3683","Fondazione Italiana Ricerca Sul Cancro (FIRC); Associazione Italiana Ricerca sul Cancro (AIRC) European Community's 7th Framework Programme [202230]; Telethon [GGP08183]; 7th Framework of the European Union commission, Funding Program for the Next Generation World-Leading Researchers (NEXT Program) [20241047]; MEXT; Center for Genomic Science of IIT@SEMM (Scuola Europea di Medicina Molecolare); AIRC; Cariplo [2007-5500]; JSPS [P09745]; European Union 7th Framework Programme [FP7-People-ITN-2008-238055]","We thank E.

Often, ligand binding, post-translational modifications and mutations modify protein activity in a manner that is not possible to rationalize solely on the basis of structural data(1). It is likely that changes in the internal motions of proteins have a major role in regulating protein activity(2-7), but the nature of their contributions remains elusive, especially in quantitative terms. Here we show that changes in conformational entropy can determine whether protein-ligand interactions will occur, even among protein complexes with identical binding interfaces. We have used NMR spectroscopy to determine the changes in structure and internal dynamics that are elicited by the binding of DNA to several variants of the catabolite activator protein (CAP) that differentially populate the inactive and active DNA-binding domain states. We found that the CAP variants have markedly different affinities for DNA, despite the CAP-DNA-binding interfaces being essentially identical in the various complexes. Combined with thermodynamic data, the results show that conformational entropy changes can inhibit the binding of CAP variants that are structurally poised for optimal DNA binding or can stimulate the binding activity of CAP variants that only transiently populate the DNA-binding-domain active state. Collectively, the data show how changes in fast internal dynamics (conformational entropy) and slow internal dynamics (energetically excited conformational states) can regulate binding activity in a way that cannot be predicted on the basis of the protein's ground-state structure.","[Tzeng, Shiou-Ru; Kalodimos, Charalampos G.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA","Kalodimos, CG (reprint author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.",babis@rutgers.edu,,,National Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB1121896],"We are grateful to L.

As medulloblastoma exhibits marked intertumoural heterogeneity, with at least four distinct molecular variants, previous attempts to identify targets for therapy have been underpowered because of small samples sizes. Here we report somatic copy number aberrations (SCNAs) in 1,087 unique medulloblastomas. SCNAs are common in medulloblastoma, and are predominantly subgroup-enriched. The most common region of focal copy number gain is a tandem duplication of SNCAIP, a gene associated with Parkinson's disease, which is exquisitely restricted to Group 4 alpha. Recurrent translocations of PVT1, including PVT1-MYC and PVT1-NDRG1, that arise through chromothripsis are restricted to Group 3. Numerous targetable SCNAs, including recurrent events targeting TGF-beta signalling in Group 3, and NF-kappa B signalling in Group 4, suggest future avenues for rational, targeted therapy.","[Holt, Robert; Marra, Marco A.] Michael Smith Genome Sci Ctr, BC Canc Agcy, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada; [Northcott, Paul A.; Shih, David J.

In conventional optical materials, the nonlinearity at light powers corresponding to single photons is negligibly weak. Here we demonstrate a medium that is nonlinear at the level of individual quanta, exhibiting strong absorption of photon pairs while remaining transparent to single photons. The quantum nonlinearity is obtained by coherently coupling slowly propagating photons(3-5) to strongly interacting atomic Rydberg states(6-12) in a cold, dense atomic gas(13,14). Our approach paves the way for quantum-byquantum control of light fields, including single-photon switching(15), all-optical deterministic quantum logic(16) and the realization of strongly correlated many-body states of light(17).","[Firstenberg, Ofer; Hofferberth, Sebastian; Lukin, Mikhail D.] Harvard Univ, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Peyronel, Thibault; Firstenberg, Ofer; Liang, Qi-Yu; Hofferberth, Sebastian; Vuletic, Vladan] MIT, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Peyronel, Thibault; Firstenberg, Ofer; Liang, Qi-Yu; Hofferberth, Sebastian; Vuletic, Vladan] MIT, Elect Res Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Gorshkov, Alexey V.] CALTECH, Inst Quantum Informat & Matter, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Pohl, Thomas] Max Planck Inst Phys Komplexer Syst, D-01187 Dresden, Germany","Lukin, MD (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",lukin@fas.harvard.edu; vuletic@mit.edu,"; Liang, Qiyu/D-9523-2012; Pohl, Thomas/B-5133-2013; Gorshkov, Alexey/A-9848-2008","Hofferberth, Sebastian/0000-0003-0309-9715; Gorshkov, Alexey/0000-0003-0509-3421",NSF; CUA; AFOSR Quantum Memories MURI; Lee A.

Some of the most striking properties of Luttinger liquids are revealed in the process of electron tunnelling. For example, as a function of the applied bias voltage or temperature, the tunnelling current exhibits a non-trivial power-law suppression(2,3). (There is no such suppression in a conventional Fermi liquid.) Here, using a carbon nanotube connected to resistive leads, we create a system that emulates tunnelling in a Luttinger liquid, by controlling the interaction of the tunnelling electron with its environment. We further replace a single tunnelling barrier with a double-barrier, resonant-level structure and investigate resonant tunnelling between Luttinger liquids. At low temperatures, we observe perfect transparency of the resonant level embedded in the interacting environment, and the width of the resonance tends to zero. We argue that this behaviour results from many-body physics of interacting electrons, and signals the presence of a quantum phase transition(4,5). Given that many parameters, including the interaction strength, can be precisely controlled in our samples, this is an attractive model system for studying quantum critical phenomena in general, with wide-reaching implications for understanding quantum phase transitions in more complex systems, such as cold atoms(6) and strongly correlated bulk materials(7).","[Mebrahtu, Henok T.; Borzenets, Ivan V.; Liu, Dong E.; Zheng, Huaixiu; Bomze, Yuriy V.; Baranger, Harold U.; Finkelstein, Gleb] Duke Univ, Dept Phys, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Smirnov, Alex I.] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Chem, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA","Finkelstein, G (reprint author), Duke Univ, Dept Phys, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",gleb@phy.duke.edu,"Zheng, Huaixiu/D-3449-2013; Baranger, Harold/O-2370-2013; Borzenets, Ivan/M-9912-2015; Smirnov, Alex/Q-9818-2016; Liu, Dong/G-2629-2017","Baranger, Harold/0000-0002-1458-2756; Borzenets, Ivan/0000-0002-1577-8312; Smirnov, Alex/0000-0002-0037-2555; ","US DOE [DE-SC0002765, DE-SC0005237, DE-FG02-02ER15354]","We appreciate discussions with I.

These counterintuitive and technologically useful behaviours have spurred considerable efforts to synthesize a broad array of negative-index metamaterials with engineered electric, magnetic or optical properties(1-10). Here we demonstrate another route to negative refraction by exploiting the inertia of electrons in semiconductor two-dimensional electron gases, collectively accelerated by electromagnetic waves according to Newton's second law of motion, where this acceleration effect manifests as kinetic inductance(11,12). Using kinetic inductance to attain negative refraction was theoretically proposed for three-dimensional metallic nanoparticles(13) and seen experimentally with surface plasmons on the surface of a three-dimensional metal(14). The two-dimensional electron gas that we use at cryogenic temperatures has a larger kinetic inductance than three-dimensional metals, leading to extraordinarily strong negative refraction at gigahertz frequencies, with an index as large as -700. This pronounced negative refractive index and the corresponding reduction in the effective wavelength opens a path to miniaturization in the science and technology of negative refraction.","[Yoon, Hosang; Yeung, Kitty Y.

Although approximately one-half of total CO2 emissions is at present taken up by combined land and ocean carbon reservoirs(2), models predict a decline in future carbon uptake by these reservoirs, resulting in a positive carbon-climate feedback(3). Several recent studies suggest that rates of carbon uptake by the land(4-6) and ocean(7-10) have remained constant or declined in recent decades. Other work, however, has called into question the reported decline(11-13). Here we use global-scale atmospheric CO2 measurements, CO2 emission inventories and their full range of uncertainties to calculate changes in global CO2 sources and sinks during the past 50 years. Our mass balance analysis shows that net global carbon uptake has increased significantly by about 0.05 billion tonnes of carbon per year and that global carbon uptake doubled, from 2.4 +/- 0.8 to 5.0 +/- 0.9 billion tonnes per year, between 1960 and 2010. Therefore, it is very unlikely that both land and ocean carbon sinks have decreased on a global scale. Since 1959, approximately 350 billion tonnes of carbon have been emitted by humans to the atmosphere, of which about 55 per cent has moved into the land and oceans. Thus, identifying the mechanisms and locations responsible for increasing global carbon uptake remains a critical challenge in constraining the modern global carbon budget and predicting future carbon-climate interactions.","[Ballantyne, A.

Recently the early Eocene has received considerable interest because it may provide insight into the response of Earth's climate and biosphere to the high atmospheric carbon dioxide levels that are expected in the near future(5) as a consequence of unabated anthropogenic carbon emissions(4,6). Climatic conditions of the early Eocene 'greenhouse world', however, are poorly constrained in critical regions, particularly Antarctica. Here we present a well-dated record of early Eocene climate on Antarctica from an ocean sediment core recovered off the Wilkes Land coast of East Antarctica. The information from biotic climate proxies (pollen and spores) and independent organic geochemical climate proxies (indices based on branched tetraether lipids) yields quantitative, seasonal temperature reconstructions for the early Eocene greenhouse world on Antarctica. We show that the climate in lowland settings along the Wilkes Land coast (at a palaeolatitude of about 70 degrees south) supported the growth of highly diverse, near-tropical forests characterized by mesothermal to megathermal floral elements including palms and Bombacoideae. Notably, winters were extremely mild (warmer than 10 degrees C) and essentially frost-free despite polar darkness, which provides a critical new constraint for the validation of climate models and for understanding the response of high-latitude terrestrial ecosystems to increased carbon dioxide forcing.","[Pross, Joerg; Contreras, Lineth; van de Schootbrugge, Bas] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Geosci, Paleoenvironm Dynam Grp, Altenhoferallee 1, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany; [Pross, Joerg] Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany; [Bijl, Peter K.; Brinkhuis, Henk] Univ Utrecht, Inst Environm Biol, Lab Palaeobot & Palynol, NL-3584 CD Utrecht, Netherlands; [Greenwood, David R.] Brandon Univ, Dept Biol, Brandon, MB R7A 6A9, Canada; [Bohaty, Steven M.] Univ Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr Southampton, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England; [Schouten, Stefan] NIOZ Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, Dept Marine Organ Biogeochem, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Texel, Netherlands; [Bendle, James A.] Univ Glasgow, Sch Geog & Earth Sci, Glasgow Mol Organ Geochem Lab, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Roehl, Ursula] Univ Bremen, MARUM Ctr Marine Environm Sci, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Tauxe, Lisa] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Raine, J.

The SAR has traditionally been approximated by a power law(1), but recent theories predict a triphasic SAR in logarithmic space, characterized by steeper increases in species richness at both small and large spatial scales(2-6). Here we uncover such universally upward accelerating SARs for amphibians, birds and mammals across the world's major landmasses. Although apparently taxon-specific and continent-specific, all curves collapse into one universal function after the area is rescaled by using the mean range sizes of taxa within continents. In addition, all EARs approximately follow a power law with a slope close to 1, indicating that for most spatial scales there is roughly proportional species extinction with area loss. These patterns can be predicted by a simulation model based on the random placement of contiguous ranges within a domain. The universality of SARs and EARs after rescaling implies that both total and endemic species richness within an area, and also their rate of change with area, can be estimated by using only the knowledge of mean geographic range size in the region and mean species richness at one spatial scale.","[Storch, David] Charles Univ Prague, Ctr Theoret Study, Prague 11000 1, Czech Republic; [Storch, David] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Prague 11000 1, Czech Republic; [Storch, David] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Ecol, CR-12844 Prague 2, Czech Republic; [Keil, Petr; Jetz, Walter] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Storch, D (reprint author), Charles Univ Prague, Ctr Theoret Study, Jilska 1, Prague 11000 1, Czech Republic.",storch@cts.cuni.cz,"Keil, Petr/A-9875-2014; Storch, David/C-3339-2017","Storch, David/0000-0001-5967-1544","Grant Agency of the Czech Republic [P505/11/2387]; Czech Ministry of Education [MSM0021620845]; EU FP7 SCALES project [26852]; National Science Foundation [DBI 0960550, DEB 1026764]; NASA Biodiversity Program [NNX11AP72G]","We thank J.

These two diversification periods bracket the depauperate vertebrate Romer's gap (360-345 Myr ago) and arthropod gap (385-325 Myr ago)(1), which could be due to preservational artefact(2,3). Although a recent molecular dating has given an age of 390 Myr for the Holometabola(4), the record of hexapods during the Early-Middle Devonian (411.5-391 Myr ago, Pragian to Givetian stages) is exceptionally sparse and based on fragmentary remains, which hinders the timing of this diversification. Indeed, although Devonian Archaeognatha are problematic(5,6), the Pragian of Scotland has given some Collembola and the incomplete insect Rhyniognatha, with its diagnostic dicondylic, metapterygotan mandibles(5,7). The oldest, definitively winged insects are from the Serpukhovian stage (latest Early Carboniferous period)(8). Here we report the first complete Late Devonian insect, which was probably a terrestrial species. Its 'orthopteroid' mandibles are of an omnivorous type, clearly not modified for a solely carnivorous diet. This discovery narrows the 45-Myr gap in the fossil record of Hexapoda, and demonstrates [GRAPHICS] further a first Devonian phase of diversification for the Hexapoda, as in vertebrates, and suggests that the Pterygota diversified before and during Romer's gap.","[Garrouste, Romain; Nel, Patricia; Grandcolas, Philippe; D'Haese, Cyrille; Nel, Andre] Museum Natl Hist Nat, CNRS, UMR 7205, CP 50, F-75005 Paris, France; [Clement, Gael; Gueriau, Pierre] Museum Natl Hist Nat, CNRS, UMR 7207, F-75005 Paris, France; [Engel, Michael S.] Univ Kansas, Nat Hist Museum, Div Entomol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Engel, Michael S.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Lagebro, Linda] Uppsala Univ, Dept Earth Sci, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden; [Denayer, Julien; Olive, Sebastien] Univ Liege, Dept Geol, Serv Paleontol Anim & Humaine, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; [Gueriau, Pierre] Minist Culture & Commun, CNRS, USR 3461, IPANEMA, F-91190 Saint Aubin, France; [Lafaite, Patrick] CNRS MNHN DICAP, Serv Multimedia, CP 27, F-75005 Paris, France; [Olive, Sebastien; Prestianni, Cyrille] Royal Belgian Inst Nat Sci, Dept Palaeontol, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium","Garrouste, R (reprint author), Museum Natl Hist Nat, CNRS, UMR 7205, CP 50, 45 Rue Buffon, F-75005 Paris, France.",garroust@mnhn.fr; anel@mnhn.fr,"D'HAESE, Cyrille/D-4896-2012; Engel, Michael/C-5461-2012","D'HAESE, Cyrille/0000-0001-6065-0927; Engel, Michael/0000-0003-3067-077X; Grandcolas, Philippe/0000-0003-1374-1222; Gueriau, Pierre/0000-0002-7529-3456",French National Agency under the TERRES project [ANR-2010-BLAN-607]; US National Science Foundation [DEB-0542909],"We thank O.

The microbiota colonizing the rhizosphere (immediately surroundingthe root) and the endophytic compartment (within the root) contribute to plant growth, productivity, carbon sequestration and phytoremediation(1-3). Colonization of the root occurs despite a sophisticated plant immune system(4,5), suggesting finely tuned discrimination of mutualists and commensals from pathogens. Genetic principles governing the derivation of host-specific endophyte communities from soil communities are poorly understood. Here we report the pyrosequencing of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene of more than 600 Arabidopsis thaliana plants to test the hypotheses that the root rhizosphere and endophytic compartmentmicrobiota of plants grown under controlled conditions in natural soils are sufficiently dependent on the host to remain consistent across different soil types and developmental stages, and sufficiently dependent on host genotype to vary between inbred Arabidopsis accessions. We describe different bacterial communities in two geochemically distinct bulk soils and in rhizosphere and endophytic compartments prepared from roots grown in these soils. The communities in each compartment are strongly influenced by soil type. Endophytic compartments fromboth soils feature overlapping, low-complexity communities that are markedly enriched in Actinobacteria and specific families from other phyla, notably Proteobacteria. Some bacteria vary quantitatively between plants of different developmental stage and genotype. Our rigorous definition of an endophytic compartment microbiome should facilitate controlled dissection of plantmicrobe interactions derived from complex soil communities.","[Lundberg, Derek S.; Lebeis, Sarah L.; Paredes, Sur Herrera; Yourstone, Scott; Gehring, Jase; Dangl, Jeffery L.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Lundberg, Derek S.; Dangl, Jeffery L.] Univ N Carolina, Curriculum Genet & Mol Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Yourstone, Scott] Univ N Carolina, Curriculum Bioinformat & Computat Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Malfatti, Stephanie; Tremblay, Julien; Engelbrektson, Anna; Kunin, Victor; del Rio, Tijana Glavina; Hugenholtz, Philip; Tringe, Susannah Green] DOE Joint Genome Inst, Walnut Creek, CA 94598 USA; [Edgar, Robert C.] Taxon Biosci Inc, Tiburon, CA 94920 USA; [Eickhorst, Thilo] Univ Bremen, Fac Biol & Chem, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Ley, Ruth E.] Cornell Univ, Dept Microbiol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Hugenholtz, Philip] Univ Queensland, Sch Chem & Mol Biosci, Australian Ctr Ecogen, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Hugenholtz, Philip] Univ Queensland, Inst Mol Biosci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Dangl, Jeffery L.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Dangl, Jeffery L.] Univ N Carolina, Carolina Ctr Genome Sci, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Dangl, Jeffery L.] Univ N Carolina, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA","Dangl, JL (reprint author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",dangl@email.unc.edu,"Engelbrektson, Anna/K-5563-2012; Hugenholtz, Philip/G-9608-2011; Engelbrektson, Anna/F-1687-2013; Eickhorst, Thilo/M-1200-2014; Ley, Ruth/M-8542-2014","Hugenholtz, Philip/0000-0001-5386-7925; Ley, Ruth/0000-0002-9087-1672; Tringe, Susannah/0000-0001-6479-8427; Herrera Paredes, Sur/0000-0001-9246-8337","US NSF [IOS-0958245]; JGI Director's Discretionary Grand Challenge Program; HHMI-GBMF Plant Science Program; Office of Science of the US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; National Institutes of Health, Minority Opportunities in Research division of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences [K12GM000678]","We thank A.

Notably, soil bacteria are able to multiply inside roots as benign endophytes and modulate plant growth and development(2), with implications ranging from enhanced crop productivity(3) to phytoremediation(4). Endophytic colonization represents an apparent paradox of plant innate immunity because plant cells can detect an array of microbeassociated molecular patterns (also known as MAMPs) to initiate immune responses to terminate microbial multiplication(5). Several studies attempted to describe the structure of bacterial root endophytes(6); however, different sampling protocols and low-resolution profiling methods make it difficult to infer general principles. Here we describemethodology to characterize and compare soil-and rootinhabiting bacterial communities, which reveals not only a function formetabolically active plant cells but also for inert cell-wall features in the selection of soil bacteria for host colonization. We showthat the roots ofArabidopsis thaliana, grown in different natural soils under controlled environmental conditions, are preferentially colonized by Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria, and each bacterial phylum is represented by a dominating class or family. Soil type defines the composition of root-inhabiting bacterial communities and host genotype determines their ribotype profiles to a limited extent. The identification of soil-type-specific members within the root-inhabiting assemblies supports our conclusion that these represent soil-derived root endophytes. Surprisingly, plant cell-wall features of other tested plant species seem to provide a sufficient cue for the assembly of approximately 40% of the Arabidopsis bacterial root-inhabitingmicrobiota, with a bias for Betaproteobacteria. Thus, this root sub-community may not beArabidopsis-specific but saprophytic bacteria that would naturally be found on any plant root or plant debris in the tested soils. By contrast, colonization of Arabidopsis roots by members of the Actinobacteria depends on other cues from metabolically active host cells.","[Bulgarelli, Davide; Rott, Matthias; Schlaeppi, Klaus; van Themaat, Emiel Ver Loren; Ahmadinejad, Nahal; Assenza, Federica; Rauf, Philipp; Schulze-Lefert, Paul] Max Planck Inst Plant Breeding Res, Dept Plant Microbe Interact, D-50829 Cologne, Germany; [Huettel, Bruno; Reinhardt, Richard] Max Planck Inst Plant Breeding Res, Max Planck Genome Ctr, D-50829 Cologne, Germany; [Peplies, Joerg; Gloeckner, Frank Oliver] Ribocon GmbH, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Gloeckner, Frank Oliver; Amann, Rudolf] Max Planck Inst Marine Microbiol, Dept Mol Ecol, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Eickhorst, Thilo] Univ Bremen, Fac Biol & Chem, D-28359 Bremen, Germany","Schulze-Lefert, P (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Plant Breeding Res, Dept Plant Microbe Interact, D-50829 Cologne, Germany.",schlef@mpipz.mpg.de,"Amann, Rudolf/C-6534-2014; Eickhorst, Thilo/M-1200-2014; Schulze-Lefert, Paul/B-6707-2011","Amann, Rudolf/0000-0002-0846-7372; Bulgarelli, Davide/0000-0002-2020-6642; Schlaeppi, Klaus/0000-0003-3620-0875",Max Planck Society [M.IF.

The age-specific prevalence of Alzheimer's disease nearly doubles every 5 years after age 65, leading to a prevalence of greater than 25% in those over the age of 90 (ref. 3). Here, to search for low-frequency variants in the amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) gene with a significant effect on the risk of Alzheimer's disease, we studied coding variants in APP in a set of whole-genome sequence data from 1,795 Icelanders. We found a coding mutation (A673T) in the APP gene that protects against Alzheimer's disease and cognitive decline in the elderly without Alzheimer's disease. This substitution is adjacent to the aspartyl protease beta-site in APP, and results in an approximately 40% reduction in the formation of amyloidogenic peptides in vitro. The strong protective effect of the A673T substitution against Alzheimer's disease provides proof of principle for the hypothesis that reducing the beta-cleavage of APP may protect against the disease. Furthermore, as the A673T allele also protects against cognitive decline in the elderly without Alzheimer's disease, the two may be mediated through the same or similar mechanisms.","[Jonsson, Thorlakur; Steinberg, Stacy; Stefansson, Hreinn; Sulem, Patrick; Gudbjartsson, Daniel; Huttenlocher, Johanna; Bjornsdottir, Gyda; Magnusson, Olafur T.; Kong, Augustine; Thorsteinsdottir, Unnur; Stefansson, Kari] deCODE Genet, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Atwal, Jasvinder K.; Maloney, Janice; Hoyte, Kwame; Gustafson, Amy; Liu, Yichin; Lu, Yanmei; Bhangale, Tushar; Graham, Robert R.; Behrens, Timothy W.; Watts, Ryan J.] Genentech Inc, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Snaedal, Jon; Jonsson, Palmi V.; Bjornsson, Sigurbjorn] Landspitali Univ Hosp, Dept Geriatr, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Huttenlocher, Johanna] Inst Human Genet, Dept Med Genet, D-72026 Tubingen, Germany; [Andreassen, Ole A.] Univ Oslo, Ulleval Univ Hosp, Dept Psychiat, N-0407 Oslo, Norway; [Andreassen, Ole A.] Univ Oslo, Inst Psychiat, N-0407 Oslo, Norway; [Jonsson, Erik G.] Karolinska Hosp & Inst, HUBIN Project, Dept Clin Neurosci, SE-17176 Stockholm, Sweden; [Palotie, Aarno] Univ Helsinki, Dept Med Genet, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Jonsson, Palmi V.; Thorsteinsdottir, Unnur; Stefansson, Kari] Univ Iceland, Fac Med, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland","Stefansson, K (reprint author), deCODE Genet, Sturlugata 8, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland.",kstefans@decode.is,,"Bjornsdottir, Gyda/0000-0002-8100-0306; Stefansson, Hreinn/0000-0002-9331-6666; Jonsson, Erik/0000-0001-8368-6332; Andreassen, Ole A./0000-0002-4461-3568; Gudbjartsson, Daniel/0000-0002-5222-9857",Lung GO Sequencing Project [HL-102923]; WHI Sequencing Project [HL-102924]; Broad GO Sequencing Project [HL-102925]; Seattle GO Sequencing Project [HL-102926]; Heart GO Sequencing Project [HL-103010],"We would like to thank the NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project and its ongoing studies, which produced and provided exome variant calls for comparison: the Lung GO Sequencing Project (HL-102923), the WHI Sequencing Project (HL-102924), the Broad GO Sequencing Project (HL-102925), the Seattle GO Sequencing Project (HL-102926) and the Heart GO Sequencing Project (HL-103010).",,28,644,662,11,215,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Aug,2012,488,7409,,,,,96,99,,10.1038/nature11283,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,981ZE,WOS:000307010700040,22801501.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,kari,stefansson,female,0.91,467,na,na

It is the most common malignant brain tumour in children, and shows tremendous biological and clinical heterogeneity(1). Despite recent treatment advances, approximately 40% of children experience tumour recurrence, and 30% will die from their disease. Those who survive often have a significantly reduced quality of life. Four tumour subgroups with distinct clinical, biological and genetic profiles are currently identified(2,3). WNT tumours, showing activated wingless pathway signalling, carry a favourable prognosis under current treatment regimens(4). SHH tumours show hedgehog pathway activation, and have an intermediate prognosis(2). Group 3 and 4 tumours are molecularly less well characterized, and also present the greatest clinical challenges(2,3,5). The full repertoire of genetic events driving this distinction, however, remains unclear. Here we describe an integrative deep-sequencing analysis of 125 tumour-normal pairs, conducted as part of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) PedBrain Tumor Project. Tetraploidy was identified as a frequent early event in Group 3 and 4 tumours, and a positive correlation between patient age and mutation rate was observed. Several recurrent mutations were identified, both in known medulloblastoma-related genes (CTNNB1, PTCH1, MLL2, SMARCA4) and in genes not previously linked to this tumour (DDX3X, CTDNEP1, KDM6A, TBR1), often in subgroup-specific patterns. RNA sequencing confirmed these alterations, and revealed the expression of what are, to our knowledge, the first medulloblastoma fusion genes identified.

Identifying and understanding the genetic events that drive these tumours is critical for the development of more effective diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic strategies. Recently, our group and others described distinct molecular subtypes ofmedulloblastoma on the basis of transcriptional and copy number profiles(2-5). Here we use whole-exome hybrid capture and deep sequencing to identify somatic mutations across the coding regions of 92 primary medulloblastoma/normal pairs. Overall, medulloblastomas have low mutation rates consistent with other paediatric tumours, with a median of 0.35 non-silent mutations per megabase. We identified twelve genes mutated at statistically significant frequencies, including previously known mutated genes in medulloblastoma such as CTNNB1, PTCH1, MLL2, SMARCA4 andTP53. Recurrent somatic mutations were newly identified in an RNA helicase gene, DDX3X, often concurrent with CTNNB1 mutations, and in the nuclear co-repressor (N-CoR) complex genes GPS2, BCOR and LDB1. We show that mutant DDX3X potentiates transactivation of a TCF promoter and enhances cell viability in combination with mutant, but not wild-type, beta-catenin. Together, our study reveals the alteration ofWNT, hedgehog, histone methyltransferase and now N-CoR pathways across medulloblastomas and within specific subtypes of this disease, and nominates theRNA helicase DDX3X as a component of pathogenic b-catenin signalling in medulloblastoma.","[Pugh, Trevor J.; Auclair, Daniel; Bochicchio, James; Carneiro, Mauricio O.; Carter, Scott L.; Cibulskis, Kristian; Erlich, Rachel L.; Greulich, Heidi; Lawrence, Michael S.; Lennon, Niall J.; McKenna, Aaron; Meldrim, James; Ramos, Alex H.; Ross, Michael G.; Russ, Carsten; Shefler, Erica; Sivachenko, Andrey; Sogoloff, Brian; Stojanov, Petar; Tamayo, Pablo; Mesirov, Jill P.; Gabriel, Stacey B.; Getz, Gad; Meyerson, Matthew; Pomeroy, Scott L.; Cho, Yoon-Jae] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Pugh, Trevor J.; Greulich, Heidi; Ramos, Alex H.; Roberts, Thomas M.; Meyerson, Matthew] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Ctr Canc Genome Discovery, Dept Biol Chem & Mol Pharmacol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Pugh, Trevor J.; Greulich, Heidi; Ramos, Alex H.; Roberts, Thomas M.; Meyerson, Matthew] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Ctr Canc Genome Discovery, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Pugh, Trevor J.; Weeraratne, Shyamal Dilhan; Archer, Tenley C.; Greulich, Heidi; Ramos, Alex H.; Amani, Vladimir; Teider, Natalia; Sengupta, Soma; Francois, Jessica Pierre; Roberts, Thomas M.; Meyerson, Matthew; Pomeroy, Scott L.; Cho, Yoon-Jae] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Weeraratne, Shyamal Dilhan; Archer, Tenley C.; Amani, Vladimir; Teider, Natalia; Sengupta, Soma; Francois, Jessica Pierre; Pomeroy, Scott L.; Cho, Yoon-Jae] Childrens Hosp, Dept Neurol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Krummel, Daniel A.

In the hereditary degenerative disease myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), transcripts from the mutant allele contain an expanded CUG repeat(1-3) and are retained in the nucleus(4,5). The mutant RNA exerts a toxic gain-of-function effect(6), making it an appropriate target for therapeutic ASOs. However, despite improvements in ASO chemistry and design, systemic use of ASOs is limited because uptake in many tissues, including skeletal and cardiac muscle, is not sufficient to silence target messenger RNAs7,8. Here we show that nuclear-retained transcripts containing expanded CUG (CUG(exp)) repeats are unusually sensitive to antisense silencing. In a transgenic mouse model of DM1, systemic administration of ASOs caused a rapid knockdown of CUG(exp) RNA in skeletal muscle, correcting the physiological, histopathologic and transcriptomic features of the disease. The effect was sustained for up to 1 year after treatment was discontinued. Systemically administered ASOs were also effective for muscle knockdown of Malat(1), a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) that is retained in the nucleus(9). These results provide a general strategy to correct RNA gain-of-function effects and to modulate the expression of expanded repeats, lncRNAs and other transcripts with prolonged nuclear residence.","[Wheeler, Thurman M.; Nakamori, Masayuki; Thornton, Charles A.] Univ Rochester, Dept Neurol, Rochester, NY 14642 USA; [Wheeler, Thurman M.; Nakamori, Masayuki; Thornton, Charles A.] Univ Rochester, Ctr Neural Dev & Dis, Rochester, NY 14642 USA; [Leger, Andrew J.; Cheng, Seng H.; Wentworth, Bruce M.] Genzyme Corp, Framingham, MA 01701 USA; [Pandey, Sanjay K.; MacLeod, A.

The 2.6 x 10(9) bases of the mouse genome possess a high degree of conservation with the human genome(1), so a thorough annotation of the mouse genome will be of significant value to understanding the function of the human genome. So far, most of the functional sequences in the mouse genome have yet to be found, and the cis-regulatory sequences in particular are still poorly annotated. Comparative genomics has been a powerful tool for the discovery of these sequences(2), but on its own it cannot resolve their temporal and spatial functions. Recently, ChIP-Seq has been developed to identify cis-regulatory elements in the genomes of several organisms including humans, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans(3-5). Here we apply the same experimental approach to a diverse set of 19 tissues and cell types in the mouse to produce a map of nearly 300,000 murine cis-regulatory sequences. The annotated sequences add up to 11% of the mouse [GRAPHICS] genome, and include more than 70% of conserved non-coding sequences. We define tissue-specific enhancers and identify potential transcription factors regulating gene expression in each tissue or cell type. Finally, we show that much of the mouse genome is organized into domains of coordinately regulated enhancers and promoters. Our results provide a resource for the annotation of functional elements in the mammalian genome and for the study of mechanisms regulating tissue-specific gene expression.","[Shen, Yin; Yue, Feng; McCleary, David F.; Ye, Zhen; Edsall, Lee; Kuan, Samantha; Wagner, Ulrich; Dixon, Jesse; Lee, Leonard; Ren, Bing] Ludwig Inst Canc Res, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Dixon, Jesse] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Med Scientist Training Program, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Dixon, Jesse] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Biomed Sci Grad Program, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Lobanenkov, Victor V.] NIAID, Immunogenet Lab, Twinbrook NIAID Facil 1, Rockville, MD 20852 USA; [Ren, Bing] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Moores Canc Ctr, Dept Cellular & Mol Med,Inst Genom Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Ren, B (reprint author), Ludwig Inst Canc Res, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",biren@ucsd.edu,,"Lobanenkov, Victor/0000-0001-6665-3635; Edsall, Lee Elizabeth/0000-0002-0326-2829",National Human Genome Research Institute [R01HG003991]; Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research; International Rett Syndrome Foundation; California Institute for Regenerative Medicine,"We thank F.

The cause of this degeneration has not been determined, but lack of energy metabolites such as glucose or lactate has been proposed. Lactate is transported exclusively by monocarboxylate transporters, and changes to these transporters alter lactate production and use. Here we show that the most abundant lactate transporter in the central nervous system, monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1, also known as SLC16A1), is highly enriched within oligodendroglia and that disruption of this transporter produces axon damage and neuron loss in animal and cell culture models. In addition, this same transporter is reduced in patients with, and in mouse models of, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, suggesting a role for oligodendroglial MCT1 in pathogenesis. The role of oligodendroglia in axon function and neuron survival has been elusive; this study defines a new fundamental mechanism by which oligodendroglia support neurons and axons.","[Lee, Youngjin; Morrison, Brett M.; Li, Yun; Farah, Mohamed H.; Hoffman, Paul N.; Liu, Yiting; Tsingalia, Akivaga; Jin, Lin; Zhang, Ping-Wu; Rothstein, Jeffrey D.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Neurol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Lengacher, Sylvain; Magistretti, Pierre J.] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Brain Mind Inst, Sch Life Sci, Stn 19, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Pellerin, Luc] Univ Lausanne, Dept Physiol, CH-1005 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Rothstein, Jeffrey D.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Neurosci, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Rothstein, Jeffrey D.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Brain Sci Inst, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Rothstein, JD (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Neurol, 855 N Wolfe St,Rangos 248, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",jrothstein@jhmi.edu,"rothstein, jeffrey/C-9470-2013; Lee, Youngjin/K-8909-2012; Pellerin, Luc/A-8912-2017; Depeursinge, Christian/L-8986-2014; Lengacher, Sylvain/C-2591-2009","Pellerin, Luc/0000-0002-1016-1970; Lengacher, Sylvain/0000-0003-2190-9654; Magistretti, Pierre Julius/0000-0002-6678-320X; LEE, Youngjin /0000-0002-5942-6204","National Institutes of Health [P50AG05146, PO1NS16375]; Muscular Dystrophy Association; Packard Center for ALS; Human Frontier Science Program [RG118/1998-B]; Swiss Fonds National de Recherche Scientifique [31003A-125063]; Swiss National Science Foundation (FNRS) [3100AO-108336/1]; Biaggi Foundation; Puccini Foundation;  [NIH-NS33958];  [P2ALS]","We thank C.

For exoplanetary systems this well-aligned configuration is not guaranteed: dynamical interactions may tilt planetary orbits, or stars may be misaligned with the protoplanetary disk through chaotic accretion(1), magnetic interactions(2) or torques from neighbouring stars. Indeed, isolated 'hot Jupiters' are often misaligned and even orbiting retrograde(3,4). Here we report an analysis of transits of planets over starspots(5-7) on the Sun-like star Kepler-30 (ref. 8), and show that the orbits of its three planets are aligned with the stellar equator. Furthermore, the orbits are aligned with one another to within a few degrees. This configuration is similar to that of our Solar System, and contrasts with the isolated hot Jupiters. The orderly alignment seen in the Kepler-30 system suggests that high obliquities are confined to systems that experienced disruptive dynamical interactions. Should this be corroborated by observations of other coplanar multi-planet systems, then star-disk misalignments would be ruled out as the explanation for the high obliquities of hot Jupiters, and dynamical interactions would be implicated as the origin of hot Jupiters.","[Sanchis-Ojeda, Roberto; Winn, Joshua N.] MIT, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Fabrycky, Daniel C.; Fortney, Jonathan J.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Astron & Astrophys, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Barclay, Thomas; Still, Martin] Bay Area Environm Res Inst, Sonoma, CA 95476 USA; [Barclay, Thomas; Clarke, Bruce D.; Jenkins, Jon M.; Koch, David; Lissauer, Jack J.; Mullally, Fergal; Seader, Shawn E.; Still, Martin; Thompson, Susan E.] NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; [Clarke, Bruce D.; Jenkins, Jon M.; Mullally, Fergal; Seader, Shawn E.; Thompson, Susan E.] SETI Inst, Mountain View, CA USA; [Ford, Eric B.] Univ Florida, Bryant Space Sci Ctr 211, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Geary, John C.; Holman, Matthew J.; Ragozzine, Darin] Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Howard, Andrew W.; Marcy, Geoffrey W.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Astron, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Sanchis-Ojeda, R (reprint author), MIT, Dept Phys, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",rsanchis86@gmail.com; daniel.fabrycky@gmail.com,"Sanchis-Ojeda, Roberto/B-6574-2013; Ragozzine, Darin/C-4926-2013","Sanchis-Ojeda, Roberto/0000-0002-6193-972X; Fabrycky, Daniel/0000-0003-3750-0183; /0000-0001-6545-639X; Barclay, Thomas/0000-0001-7139-2724; Fortney, Jonathan/0000-0002-9843-4354",NASA's Science Mission Directorate; NASA [NAS5-26555]; NASA Office of Space Science [NNX09AF08G]; NASA through Hubble Fellowship [HF-51272.01-A]; STScI; NASA through the Kepler Participating Scientist programme,"Kepler was competitively selected as the tenth Discovery mission.

In relativistic quantum field theory, a broken continuous symmetry leads to the emergence of two types of fundamental excitation: massless Nambu-Goldstone modes and a massive 'Higgs' amplitude mode. An excitation of Higgs type is of crucial importance in the standard model of elementary particle physics(1), and also appears as a fundamental collective mode in quantum many-body systems(2). Whether such a mode exists in low-dimensional systems as a resonance-like feature, or whether it becomes overdamped through coupling to Nambu-Goldstone modes, has been a subject of debate(2-9). Here we experimentally find and study a Higgs mode in a two-dimensional neutral superfluid close to a quantum phase transition to a Mott insulating phase. We unambiguously identify the mode by observing the expected reduction in frequency of the onset of spectral response when approaching the transition point. In this regime, our system is described by an effective relativistic field theory with a two-component quantum field(2,7), which constitutes a minimal model for spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry. Additionally, all microscopic parameters of our system are known from first principles and the resolution of our measurement allows us to detect excited states of the many-body system at the level of individual quasi-particles. This allows for an in-depth study of Higgs excitations that also addresses the consequences of the reduced dimensionality and confinement of the system. Our work constitutes a step towards exploring emergent relativistic models with ultracold atomic gases.","[Endres, Manuel; Fukuhara, Takeshi; Cheneau, Marc; Schauss, Peter; Gross, Christian; Kuhr, Stefan; Bloch, Immanuel] Max Planck Inst Quantum Opt, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Pekker, David] CALTECH, Dept Phys, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Demler, Eugene] Harvard Univ, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kuhr, Stefan] Univ Strathclyde, SUPA, Glasgow G4 0NG, Lanark, Scotland; [Bloch, Immanuel] Univ Munich, D-80799 Munich, Germany","Endres, M (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Quantum Opt, D-85748 Garching, Germany.",manuel.endres@mpq.mpg.de,"Bloch, Immanuel/G-3174-2010; Kuhr, Stefan/F-7296-2011; Fukuhara, Takeshi/A-6254-2014; Cheneau, Marc/O-9312-2014; Gross, Christian/P-5475-2014","Bloch, Immanuel/0000-0002-0679-4759; Fukuhara, Takeshi/0000-0002-6702-9882; Cheneau, Marc/0000-0001-7261-566X; Gross, Christian/0000-0003-2292-5234; Schauss, Peter/0000-0002-8505-5195",MPG; DFG; EU; JSPS; California Institute of Technology (IQIM,"We thank C.

This simple but powerful feature is essential for information processing technology, and also provides a platform for fundamental physics research(1-16). As the number of charges essentially determines the electronic phase of a condensed-matter system, transistor operation enables reversible and isothermal changes in the system's state, as successfully demonstrated in electric-field-induced ferromagnetism(2-4) and superconductivity(5-10). However, this effect of the electric field is limited to a channel thickness of nanometres or less, owing to the presence of Thomas-Fermi screening. Here we show that this conventional picture does not apply to a class of materials characterized by inherent collective interactions between electrons and the crystal lattice. We prepared metal-insulator-semiconductor field-effect transistors based on vanadium dioxide-a strongly correlated-material with a thermally driven, first-order metal-insulator transition well above room temperature(17-23)-and found that electrostatic charging at a surface drives all the previously localized charge carriers in the bulk material into motion, leading to the emergence of a three-dimensional metallic ground state. This non-local switching of the electronic state is achieved by applying a voltage of only about one volt. In a voltage-sweep measurement, the first-order nature of the metal-insulator transition provides a non-volatilememory effect, which is operable at room temperature. Our results demonstrate a conceptually new field-effect device, extending the concept of electric-field control to macroscopic phase control.","[Nakano, M.; Shibuya, K.; Okuyama, D.; Hatano, T.; Ono, S.; Kawasaki, M.; Iwasa, Y.; Tokura, Y.] RIKEN Adv Sci Inst, CERG, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Nakano, M.; Shibuya, K.; Okuyama, D.; Hatano, T.; Ono, S.; Kawasaki, M.; Iwasa, Y.; Tokura, Y.] RIKEN Adv Sci Inst, Cross Correlated Mat Res Grp CMRG, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Ono, S.] Cent Res Inst Elect Power Ind, Komae, Tokyo 2018511, Japan; [Kawasaki, M.; Iwasa, Y.; Tokura, Y.] Univ Tokyo, Quantum Phase Elect Ctr, Tokyo 1138656, Japan; [Kawasaki, M.; Iwasa, Y.; Tokura, Y.] Univ Tokyo, Dept Appl Phys, Tokyo 1138656, Japan","Nakano, M (reprint author), RIKEN Adv Sci Inst, CERG, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan.",mnakano@riken.jp; iwasa@ap.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Okuyama, Daisuke/A-2796-2010; Kawasaki, Masashi/B-5826-2008; Shibuya, Keisuke/K-2079-2012; Iwasa, Yoshihiro/C-1719-2009; Hatano, Takafumi/B-3647-2013; Tokura, Yoshinori/C-7352-2009; Nakano, Masaki/K-6112-2012",,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSAP) through 'Funding Program for World-Leading Innovative R&D on Science and Technology (FIRST Program)'; RIKEN through the Incentive Research Grant;  [22760016];  [21224009],"We are grateful to K.

Here we harness the inherent scalability of fibre production(6) and an in-fibre Plateau-Rayleigh capillary instability(7) for the fabrication of uniformly sized, structured spherical particles spanning an exceptionally wide range of sizes: from 2 mm down to 20 nm. Thermal processing of a multimaterial fibre(8) controllably induces the instability(9), resulting in a well-ordered, oriented emulsion(10) in three dimensions. The fibre core and cladding correspond to the dispersed and continuous phases, respectively, and are both frozen in situ on cooling, after which the particles are released when needed. By arranging a variety of structures and materials in a macroscopic scaled-up model of the fibre, we produce composite, structured, spherical particles, such as core-shell particles, two-compartment 'Janus' particles(11), and multi-sectioned 'beach ball' particles. Moreover, producing fibres with a high density of cores allows for an unprecedented level of parallelization. In principle, 10(8) 50-nm cores may be embedded in metres-long, 1-mm-diameter fibre, which can be induced to break up simultaneously throughout its length, into uniformly sized, structured spheres.","[Kaufman, Joshua J.; Tao, Guangming; Shabahang, Soroush; Banaei, Esmaeil-Hooman; Abouraddy, Ayman F.] Univ Cent Florida, CREOL, Coll Opt & Photon, Orlando, FL 32816 USA; [Banaei, Esmaeil-Hooman] Univ Cent Florida, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Orlando, FL 32816 USA; [Deng, Daosheng S.] MIT, Dept Chem Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Liang, Xiangdong; Johnson, Steven G.] MIT, Dept Math, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Fink, Yoel] MIT, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Abouraddy, AF (reprint author), Univ Cent Florida, CREOL, Coll Opt & Photon, Orlando, FL 32816 USA.",raddy@creol.ucf.edu,"Abouraddy, Ayman/I-7963-2012; Liang, Xiangdong/C-5903-2016","Tao, Guangming/0000-0002-1371-7735; Johnson, Steven/0000-0001-7327-4967",US National Science Foundation [ECCS-1002295]; Ralph E.

Losses are dominated by dynamic thinning, in which forcings by oceanic or atmospheric perturbations to the ice margin lead to an accelerated thinning of ice along the coastline(2-5). Although central to improving projections of future ice-sheet contributions to global sea-level rise, the incorporation of dynamic thinning into models has been restricted by lack of knowledge of basal topography and subglacial geology so that the rate and ultimate extent of potential WAIS retreat remains difficult to quantify. Here we report the discovery of a subglacial basin under Ferrigno Ice Stream up to 1.5 kilometres deep that connects the ice-sheet interior to the Bellingshausen Sea margin, and whose existence profoundly affects ice loss. We use a suite of ice-penetrating radar, magnetic and gravity measurements to propose a rift origin for the basin in association with the wider development of the West Antarctic rift system. The Ferrigno rift, overdeepened by glacial erosion, is a conduit which fed a major palaeo-ice stream on the adjacent continental shelf during glacial maxima(6). The palaeo-ice stream, in turn, eroded the 'Belgica' trough, which today routes warm open-ocean water back to the ice front(7) to reinforce dynamic thinning. We show that dynamic thinning from both the Bellingshausen and Amundsen Sea region is being steered back to the ice-sheet interior along rift basins.

Respiration exhibits an exponential temperature dependence at the subcellular and individual levels(1), but at the ecosystem level respiration can be modified by many variables(2-4) including community abundance and biomass(5), which vary substantially among ecosystems(6). Despite its importance for predicting the responses of the biosphere to climate change, it is as yet unknown whether the temperature dependence of ecosystem respiration varies systematically between aquatic and terrestrial environments. Here we use the largest database of respiratory measurements yet compiled to show that the sensitivity of ecosystem respiration to seasonal changes in temperature is remarkably similar for diverse environments encompassing lakes, rivers, estuaries, the open ocean and forested and non-forested terrestrial ecosystems, with an average activation energy similar to that of the respiratory complex(3) (approximately 0.65 electronvolts (eV)). By contrast, annual ecosystem respiration shows a substantially greater temperature dependence across aquatic (approximately 0.65 eV) versus terrestrial ecosystems (approximately 0.32 eV) that span broad geographic gradients in temperature. Using a model(5) derived from metabolic theory(7), these findings can be reconciled by similarities in the biochemical kinetics of metabolism at the subcellular level, and fundamental differences in the importance of other variables besides temperature-such as primary productivity and allochthonous carbon inputs-on the structure of aquatic and terrestrial biota at the community level.","[Yvon-Durocher, Gabriel; Dossena, Matteo; Trimmer, Mark; Woodward, Guy] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, London E1 4NS, England; [Yvon-Durocher, Gabriel] Univ Exeter, Environm & Sustainabil Inst, Penryn TR10 9EZ, Cornwall, England; [Caffrey, Jane M.] Univ W Florida, Ctr Environm Diagnost & Bioremediat, Pensacola, FL 32514 USA; [Cescatti, Alessandro] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, I-21027 Ispra, Italy; [del Giorgio, Paul] Univ Quebec Montreal, Dept Sci Biol, Montreal, PQ H2X 3X8, Canada; [Gasol, Josep M.; Montoya, Jose M.] Inst Marine Sci ICM CSIC, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain; [Pumpanen, Jukka] Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Staehr, Peter A.] Aarhus Univ, Inst Biosci, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; [Allen, Andrew P.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia","Yvon-Durocher, G (reprint author), Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, London E1 4NS, England.",g.yvon-durocher@exeter.ac.uk,"Allen, Andrew/B-8045-2011; Pumpanen, Jukka/B-1254-2012; Gasol, Josep M/B-1709-2008; Staehr, Peter /J-3693-2013; Yvon-Durocher, Gabriel/M-4600-2014","Allen, Andrew/0000-0003-0304-7544; Pumpanen, Jukka/0000-0003-4879-3663; Gasol, Josep M/0000-0001-5238-2387; Staehr, Peter /0000-0002-1580-4875; Yvon-Durocher, Gabriel/0000-0002-1749-3417; Montoya, Jose M./0000-0002-6676-7592","Natural Environment Research Council, UK [NE/F004753/1]; Danish Council for Independent Research, Natural Sciences [10-085238]; Danish Centre for Lake Restoration(CLEAR); Academy of Finland Centre of Excellence program [218094]; Ramon y Cajal Fellowship [RYC-892 2008-03664]; Ministry of Economy [CGL2010-20091]; Generalitat de Catalunya [2009SGR142]","We wish to thank J.

In many cases, malnutrition is associated with diarrhoea and intestinal inflammation, further contributing to morbidity and death(2). The mechanisms by which unbalanced dietary nutrients affect intestinal homeostasis are largely unknown. Here we report that deficiency in murine angiotensin I converting enzyme (peptidyl-dipeptidase A) 2 (Ace2), which encodes a key regulatory enzyme of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), results in highly increased susceptibility to intestinal inflammation induced by epithelial damage. The RAS is known to be involved in acute lung failure(3), cardiovascular functions(4) and SARS infections(5). Mechanistically, ACE2 has a RAS-independent function, regulating intestinal amino acid homeostasis, expression of antimicrobial peptides, and the ecology of the gut microbiome. Transplantation of the altered microbiota from Ace2 mutant mice into germ-free wild-type hosts was able to transmit the increased propensity to develop severe colitis. ACE2-dependent changes in epithelial immunity and the gut microbiota can be directly regulated by the dietary amino acid tryptophan. Our results identify ACE2 as a key regulator of dietary amino acid homeostasis, innate immunity, gut microbial ecology, and transmissible susceptibility to colitis. These results provide a molecular explanation for how amino acid malnutrition can cause intestinal inflammation and diarrhoea.","[Hashimoto, Tatsuo; Perlot, Thomas; Trichereau, Jean; Paolino, Magdalena; Sigl, Verena; Hanada, Toshikatsu; Hanada, Reiko; Penninger, Josef M.] Austrian Acad Sci, Inst Mol Biotechnol, IMBA, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Hashimoto, Tatsuo; Ishiguro, Hiroaki] Yokohama City Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Med Sci & Cardiorenal Med, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360004, Japan; [Hashimoto, Tatsuo; Ishiguro, Hiroaki] Sch Med, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360004, Japan; [Rehman, Ateequr; Lipinski, Simone; Schreiber, Stefan; Rosenstiel, Philip] Univ Kiel, Inst Clin Mol Biol, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Wild, Birgit; Richter, Andreas] Univ Vienna, Ctr Ecol, Dept Chem Ecol & Ecosyst Res, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Camargo, Simone M.

Inducing the expression of latent genomes within resting CD4(+) T cells is the primary strategy to clear this reservoir(2,3). Although histone deacetylase inhibitors such as suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (also known as vorinostat, VOR) can disrupt HIV-1 latency in vitro(4-6), the utility of this approach has never been directly proven in a translational clinical study of HIV-infected patients. Here we isolated the circulating resting CD4(+) T cells of patients in whom viraemia was fully suppressed by antiretroviral therapy, and directly studied the effect of VOR on this latent reservoir. In each of eight patients, a single dose of VOR increased both biomarkers of cellular acetylation, and simultaneously induced an increase in HIV RNA expression in resting CD4(+) cells (mean increase, 4.8-fold). This demonstrates that a molecular mechanism known to enforce HIV latency can be therapeutically targeted in humans, provides proof-of-concept for histone deacetylase inhibitors as a therapeutic class, and defines a precise approach to test novel strategies to attack and eradicate latent HIV infection directly.","[Archin, N.

Because of the restricted size of their genomes, viruses have had to evolve efficient ways of exploiting host cell processes to promote their own life cycles and also to escape host immune defence mechanisms(1,2). Many viral open reading frames (viORFs) with immune-modulating functions essential for productive viral growth have been identified across a range of viral classes(3,4). However, there has been no comprehensive study to identify the host factors with which these viORFs interact for a global perspective of viral perturbation strategies(5-11). Here we show that different viral perturbation patterns of the host molecular defence network can be deduced from a mass-spectrometry-based host-factor survey in a defined human cellular system by using 70 innate immune-modulating viORFs from 30 viral species. The 579 host proteins targeted by the viORFs mapped to an unexpectedly large number of signalling pathways and cellular processes, suggesting yet unknown mechanisms of antiviral immunity. We further experimentally verified the targets heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U, phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase, the WNK (with-no-lysine) kinase family and USP19 (ubiquitin-specific peptidase 19) as vulnerable nodes in the host cellular defence system. Evaluation of the impact of viral immune modulators on the host molecular network revealed perturbation strategies used by individual viruses and by viral classes. Our data are also valuable for the design of broad and specific antiviral therapies.","[Pichlmair, Andreas; Kandasamy, Kumaran; Sacco, Roberto; Stefanovic, Adrijana; Eberle, Carol-Ann; Goncalves, Adriana; Buerckstuemmer, Tilmann; Mueller, Andre C.; Fauster, Astrid; Bennett, Keiryn L.; Colinge, Jacques; Superti-Furga, Giulio] Austrian Acad Sci, CeMM Res Ctr Mol Med, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Pichlmair, Andreas; Habjan, Matthias; Holze, Cathleen] Max Planck Inst Biochem, Innate Immun Lab, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany; [Alvisi, Gualtiero; Binder, Marco; Bartenschlager, Ralf] Heidelberg Univ, Dept Infect Dis, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Mulhern, Orla; Bowie, Andrew G.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Trinity Biomed Sci Inst, Sch Biochem & Immunol, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Habjan, Matthias; Kochs, Georg; Weber, Friedemann] Univ Freiburg, Dept Virol, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Lindsten, Kristina] Karolinska Inst, Dept Cell & Mol Biol, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Goodbourn, Stephen] Univ London, Div Basic Med Sci, London SW17 0RE, England; [Weber, Friedemann] Univ Freiburg, Ctr Biol Signalling Studies BIOSS, D-79108 Freiburg, Germany; [Weber, Friedemann] Univ Marburg, Inst Virol, D-35043 Marburg, Germany","Superti-Furga, G (reprint author), Austrian Acad Sci, CeMM Res Ctr Mol Med, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",gsuperti@cemm.oeaw.ac.at,"Binder, Marco/E-9717-2011; Superti-Furga, Giulio/F-4755-2015; Bartenschlager, Ralf/L-2582-2015","Binder, Marco/0000-0002-5805-6109; Superti-Furga, Giulio/0000-0002-0570-1768; Bowie, Andrew/0000-0001-5316-4373; Alvisi, Gualtiero/0000-0002-8177-3616; Weber, Friedemann/0000-0001-9737-337X; Kandasamy, Richard Kumaran/0000-0002-0894-1222; Buerckstuemmer, Tilmann/0000-0002-5961-0829; Habjan, Matthias/0000-0002-3623-4496","Austrian Academy of Sciences; i-FIVE European Research Council; European Molecular Biology Organization [ATLF 463-2008]; Science Foundation Ireland [07/IN1/B934]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [We2616/5-2, SFB593/B13, Ko1579/5-1, FOR1202]; German Ministry for Education and Research (Suszeptibilitat bei Infektionen) [01KI 0786]; Austrian Ministry of Science and Research (GEN-AU/BIN)","We thank C.

Understanding genotype-phenotype relationships requires that phenotypes be viewed as manifestations of network properties, rather than simply as the result of individual genomic variations(1). Genome sequencing efforts have identified numerous germline mutations, and large numbers of somatic genomic alterations, associated with a predisposition to cancer(2). However, it remains difficult to distinguish background, or 'passenger', cancer mutations from causal, or 'driver', mutations in these data sets. Human viruses intrinsically depend on their host cell during the course of infection and can elicit pathological phenotypes similar to those arising from mutations(3). Here we test the hypothesis that genomic variations and tumour viruses may cause cancer through related mechanisms, by systematically examining host interactome and transcriptome network perturbations caused by DNA tumour virus proteins. The resulting integrated viral perturbation data reflects rewiring of the host cell networks, and highlights pathways, such as Notch signalling and apoptosis, that go awry in cancer. We show that systematic analyses of host targets of viral proteins can identify cancer genes with a success rate on a par with their identification through functional genomics and large-scale cataloguing of tumour mutations. Together, these complementary approaches increase the specificity of cancer gene identification. Combining systems-level studies of pathogen-encoded gene products with genomic approaches will facilitate the prioritization of cancer-causing driver genes to advance the understanding of the genetic basis of human cancer.","[Rozenblatt-Rosen, Orit;

However, the cellular behaviours that lead to a properly regenerated tissue are not well understood. Using a new, non-invasive, intravital two-photon imaging approach we study physiological hair-follicle regeneration over time in live mice. By these means we have monitored the behaviour of epithelial stem cells and their progeny(2-4) during physiological hair regeneration and addressed how the mesenchyme(5) influences their behaviour. Consistent with earlier studies(6), stem cells are quiescent during the initial stages of hair regeneration, whereas the progeny are more actively dividing. Moreover, stem cell progeny divisions are spatially organized within follicles. In addition to cell divisions, coordinated cell movements of the progeny allow the rapid expansion of the hair follicle. Finally, we show the requirement of the mesenchyme for hair regeneration through targeted cell ablation and long-term tracking of live hair follicles. Thus, we have established an in vivo approach that has led to the direct observation of cellular mechanisms of growth regulation within the hair follicle and that has enabled us to precisely investigate functional requirements of hair-follicle components during the process of physiological regeneration.","[Rompolas, Panteleimon; Deschene, Elizabeth R.; Zito, Giovanni; Saotome, Ichiko; Greco, Valentina] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Yale Canc Ctr, Dept Genet,Dept Dermatol,Yale Stem Cell Ctr, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Gonzalez, David G.; Haberman, Ann M.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Lab Med, New Haven, CT 06510 USA","Greco, V (reprint author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, Yale Canc Ctr, Dept Genet,Dept Dermatol,Yale Stem Cell Ctr, 333 Cedar St, New Haven, CT 06510 USA.",valentina.greco@yale.edu,,,"James Hudson Brown-Alexander Brown Coxe postdoctoral fellowship; National Institute of General Medical Sciences, US National Institutes of Health, Public Health Service; American Skin Association; American Cancer Society; Yale Rheumatologic Disease Research Core Center [NIH P30AR053495]","We are grateful to A.

Many studies have focused on cell-autonomous mechanisms of drug resistance. By contrast, we proposed that the tumour micro-environment confers innate resistance to therapy. Here we developed a co-culture system to systematically assay the ability of 23 stromal cell types to influence the innate resistance of 45 cancer cell lines to 35 anticancer drugs. We found that stroma-mediated resistance is common, particularly to targeted agents. We characterized further the stroma-mediated resistance of BRAF-mutant melanoma to RAF inhibitors because most patients with this type of cancer show some degree of innate resistance(1-4). Proteomic analysis showed that stromal cell secretion of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) resulted in activation of the HGF receptor MET, reactivation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K)-AKT signalling pathways, and immediate resistance to RAF inhibition. Immunohistochemistry experiments confirmed stromal cell expression of HGF in patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma and showed a significant correlation between HGF expression by stromal cells and innate resistance to RAF inhibitor treatment. Dual inhibition of RAF and either HGF or MET resulted in reversal of drug resistance, suggesting RAF plus HGF or MET inhibitory combination therapy as a potential therapeutic strategy for BRAF-mutant melanoma. A similar resistance mechanism was uncovered in a subset of BRAF-mutant colorectal and glioblastoma cell lines. More generally, this study indicates that the systematic dissection of interactions between tumours and their micro-environment can uncover important mechanisms underlying drug resistance.","[Straussman, Ravid; Shee, Kevin; Barzily-Rokni, Michal; Du, Jinyan; Davis, Ashli; Mongare, Margaret M.; Gould, Joshua; Golub, Todd R.] Eli & Edythe L Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Morikawa, Teppei; Qian, Zhi Rong; Ogino, Shuji] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Frederick, Dennie T.; Cooper, Zachary A.; Flaherty, Keith T.; Wargo, Jennifer A.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Div Surg Oncol Med Oncol & Dermatol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Chapman, Paul B.; Solit, David B.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Med, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Solit, David B.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Human Oncol & Pathogenesis Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Ribas, Antoni] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Div Hematol & Oncol, Dept Med, Jonsson Comprehens Canc Ctr, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Ribas, Antoni; Lo, Roger S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Mol & Med Pharmacol, Jonsson Comprehens Canc Ctr, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Lo, Roger S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Div Dermatol, Dept Med, Jonsson Comprehens Canc Ctr, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Ogino, Shuji] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Ogino, Shuji; Golub, Todd R.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Golub, Todd R.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Pediat Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Golub, Todd R.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chevy Chase, MD 20815 USA","Golub, TR (reprint author), Eli & Edythe L Broad Inst, 7 Cambridge Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",golub@broadinstitute.org,,"Qian, Zhi rong/0000-0003-1633-4120; Cooper, Zachary/0000-0003-1059-0940","Howard Hughes Medical Institute; National Cancer Institute [P50CA093683, U54CA112962]; Melanoma Research Alliance Team Science Award","We thank all members of the Golub laboratory for discussions.

However, the efficacy of kinase inhibitors in patients whose tumours harbour such alleles is invariably limited by innate or acquired drug resistance(2,3). The identification of resistance mechanisms has revealed a recurrent theme-the engagement of survival signals redundant to those transduced by the targeted kinase(4). Cancer cells typically express multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that mediate signals that converge on common critical downstream cell-survival effectors-most notably, phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)(5). Consequently, an increase in RTK-ligand levels, through autocrine tumour-cell production, paracrine contribution from tumour stroma(6) or systemic production, could confer resistance to inhibitors of an oncogenic kinase with a similar signalling output. Here, using a panel of kinase-'addicted' human cancer cell lines, we found that most cells can be rescued from drug sensitivity by simply exposing them to one or more RTK ligands. Among the findings with clinical implications was the observation that hepatocyte growth factor(HGF) confers resistance to the BRAF inhibitor PLX4032 (vemurafenib) in BRAF-mutant melanoma cells. These observations highlight the extensive redundancy of RTK-transduced signalling in cancer cells and the potentially broad role of widely expressed RTK ligands in innate and acquired resistance to drugs targeting oncogenic kinases.","[Wilson, Timothy R.; Chan, Emily; Peng, Jing; Lin, Eva; Merchant, Mark; Neve, Richard; Settleman, Jeff] Genentech Inc, Res Oncol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Fridlyand, Jane] Genentech Inc, Biostatast, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Yan, Yibing; Penuel, Elicia; Burton, Luciana; Wang, Yulei] Genentech Inc, Dev Sci, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Sosman, Jeff] Vanderbilt Univ, Med Ctr, Div Hematol Oncol, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [Ribas, Antoni] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Jonsson Comprehens Canc Ctr, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Li, Jiang] Roche Nutley, Med Dev Biometr Biostat, Nutley, NJ 07110 USA; [Moffat, John] Genentech Inc, Biochem & Cellular Pharmacol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Sutherlin, Daniel P.] Genentech Inc, Discovery Chem, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Koeppen, Hartmut] Genentech Inc, Res Pathol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA","Settleman, J (reprint author), Genentech Inc, Res Oncol, 1 DNA Way, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA.",settleman.jeffrey@gene.com,"Wilson, Timothy/F-8210-2012","Merchant, Mark/0000-0003-0690-8581",NCI NIH HHS [K24 CA097588],,,29,597,606,4,86,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-Jul,2012,487,7408,,,,,505,U1652,,10.1038/nature11249,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,979KD,WOS:000306815300043,22763448.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,jeff,settleman,male,1,2925,na,na

Here, we adapted a microfluidic device(2) for efficient capture of CTCs from an endogenous mouse pancreatic cancer model(3) and subjected CTCs to single-molecule RNA sequencing(4), identifying Wnt2 as a candidate gene enriched in CTCs. Expression of WNT2 in pancreatic cancer cells suppresses anoikis, enhances anchorage-independent sphere formation, and increases metastatic propensity in vivo. This effect is correlated with fibronectin upregulation and suppressed by inhibition of MAP3K7 (also known as TAK1) kinase. In humans, formation of non-adherent tumour spheres by pancreatic cancer cells is associated with upregulation of multiple WNT genes, and pancreatic CTCs revealed enrichment for WNT signalling in 5 out of 11 cases. Thus, molecular analysis of CTCs may identify candidate therapeutic targets to prevent the distal spread of cancer.","[Yu, Min; Ting, David T.; Stott, Shannon L.; Wittner, Ben S.; Paul, Suchismita; Ciciliano, Jordan C.; Smas, Malgorzata E.; Winokur, Daniel; Gilman, Anna J.; Ulman, Matthew J.; Xega, Kristina; Contino, Gianmarco; Alagesan, Brinda; Brannigan, Brian W.; Ryan, David P.; Sequist, Lecia V.; Bardeesy, Nabeel; Ramaswamy, Sridhar; Toner, Mehmet; Maheswaran, Shyamala; Haber, Daniel A.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Canc, Ctr Engn Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Yu, Min; Ting, David T.; Stott, Shannon L.; Wittner, Ben S.; Paul, Suchismita; Ciciliano, Jordan C.; Smas, Malgorzata E.; Winokur, Daniel; Gilman, Anna J.; Ulman, Matthew J.; Xega, Kristina; Contino, Gianmarco; Alagesan, Brinda; Brannigan, Brian W.; Ryan, David P.; Sequist, Lecia V.; Bardeesy, Nabeel; Ramaswamy, Sridhar; Toner, Mehmet; Maheswaran, Shyamala; Haber, Daniel A.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Yu, Min; Ting, David T.; Stott, Shannon L.; Wittner, Ben S.; Paul, Suchismita; Ciciliano, Jordan C.; Smas, Malgorzata E.; Winokur, Daniel; Gilman, Anna J.; Ulman, Matthew J.; Xega, Kristina; Contino, Gianmarco; Alagesan, Brinda; Brannigan, Brian W.; Ryan, David P.; Sequist, Lecia V.; Bardeesy, Nabeel; Ramaswamy, Sridhar; Toner, Mehmet; Maheswaran, Shyamala; Haber, Daniel A.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Surg, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Yu, Min; Haber, Daniel A.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chevy Chase, MD 20815 USA; [Ozsolak, Fatih; Milos, Patrice M.] Helicos BioSci Corp, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Maheswaran, S (reprint author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Canc, Ctr Engn Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",maheswaran@helix.mgh.harvard.edu; haber@helix.mgh.harvard.edu,,"Contino, Gianmarco/0000-0001-5874-0405; Ting, David/0000-0002-3261-2322",Stand Up To Cancer; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NIBIB [5R01EB008047]; NIH [CA129933]; Pancreatic Cancer Action Network - AACR Fellowship; Warshaw Institute for Pancreatic Cancer Research; K12 Paul Calabresi Award for Clinical Oncology Clinical Research Career Development Program NIH [5K12CA87723-09],"We thank C.

HCOs function as the terminal enzymes in the respiratory chain of mitochondria and aerobic prokaryotes, coupling molecular oxygen reduction to transmembrane proton pumping. Integral to the enzyme's function is the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to the oxidase via a transient association of the two proteins. Electron entry and exit are proposed to occur from the same site on cytochrome c(2-4). Here we report the crystal structure of the caa(3)-type cytochrome oxidase from Thermus thermophilus, which has a covalently tethered cytochrome c domain. Crystals were grown in a bicontinuous mesophase using a synthetic short-chain monoacylglycerol as the hosting lipid. From the electron density map, at 2.36 angstrom resolution, a novel integral membrane subunit and a native glycoglycerophospholipid embedded in the complex were identified. Contrary to previous electron transfer mechanisms observed for soluble cytochrome c, the structure reveals the architecture of the electron transfer complex for the fused cupredoxin/cytochrome c domain, which implicates different sites on cytochrome c for electron entry and exit. Support for an alternative to the classical proton gate characteristic of this HCO class is presented.","[Lyons, Joseph A.; Slattery, Orla; Soulimane, Tewfik] Univ Limerick, Dept Chem & Environm Sci, Limerick, Ireland; [Lyons, Joseph A.; Aragao, David; Caffrey, Martin] Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Biochem & Immunol, Dublin, Ireland; [Aragao, David] Australian Synchrotron, Clayton, Vic 3168, Australia; [Pisliakov, Andrei V.] RIKEN Adv Sci Inst, Theoret Biochem Lab, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Soulimane, Tewfik] Univ Limerick, Mat & Surface Sci Inst, Limerick, Ireland; [Caffrey, Martin] Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Med, Dublin, Ireland","Soulimane, T (reprint author), Univ Limerick, Dept Chem & Environm Sci, Limerick, Ireland.",tewfik.soulimane@ul.ie; martin.caffrey@tcd.ie,"Pisliakov, Andrei/C-7007-2012; Aragao, David/A-1695-2012","Pisliakov, Andrei/0000-0003-1536-0589; Aragao, David/0000-0002-6551-4657; Caffrey, Martin/0000-0002-2931-4551; Lyons, Joseph/0000-0003-0218-4862","Science Foundation Ireland [07/IN.1/B1836, BICF685]; National Institutes of Health [GM75915, P50GM073210, U54GM094599]; FP7 COST [CM0902]; Marie Curie Actions [PIEF-GA-2009-235612]","We acknowledge support from Science Foundation Ireland Grants 07/IN.1/B1836 (M.

However, because the fate of bloom biomass could not be adequately resolved in these experiments, the timescales of carbon sequestration from the atmosphere are uncertain. Here we report the results of a five-week experiment carried out in the closed core of a vertically coherent, mesoscale eddy of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, during which we tracked sinking particles from the surface to the deep-sea floor. A large diatom bloom peaked in the fourth week after fertilization. This was followed by mass mortality of several diatom species that formed rapidly sinking, mucilaginous aggregates of entangled cells and chains. Taken together, multiple lines of evidence-although each with important uncertainties-lead us to conclude that at least half the bloom biomass sank far below a depth of 1,000 metres and that a substantial portion is likely to have reached the sea floor. Thus, iron-fertilized diatom blooms may sequester carbon for timescales of centuries in ocean bottom water and for longer in the sediments.","[Smetacek, Victor; Klaas, Christine; Strass, Volker H.; Assmy, Philipp; Cisewski, Boris; Bathmann, Ulrich; Henjes, Joachim; Losch, Martin; Peeken, Ilka; Sachs, Oliver; Sauter, Eberhard; Schwarz, Jill; Terbrueggen, Anja; Wolf-Gladrow, Dieter] Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, D-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany; [Smetacek, Victor] Natl Inst Oceanog, Panaji 403004, Goa, India; [Assmy, Philipp] Norwegian Polar Res Inst, Fram Ctr, N-9296 Tromso, Norway; [Montresor, Marina] Stn Zool Anton Dohrn, I-80121 Naples, Italy; [Cisewski, Boris] Johann Heinrich von Thunen Inst, Inst Sea Fisheries, D-22767 Hamburg, Germany; [Savoye, Nicolas] Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Analyt & Environm Chem, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Savoye, Nicolas] Univ Bordeaux, CNRS, EPOC, UMR 5805,Stn Marine Arcachon, F-33120 Arcachon, France; [Webb, Adrian] Univ Cape Town, Dept Oceanog, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa; [d'Ovidio, Francesco] CNRS UPMC IRD MNHN, LOCEAN IPSL, F-75252 Paris, France; [Arrieta, Jesus M.; Gonzalez, Santiago; Herndl, Gerhard J.] Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, Dept Biol Oceanog, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Netherlands; [Arrieta, Jesus M.] CSIC UIB, Inst Mediterraneo Estudios Avanzados, Dept Global Change Res, Esporles 07190, Mallorca, Spain; [Bathmann, Ulrich] Leibniz Inst Balt Sea Res Warnemunde, D-18119 Rostock, Germany; [Bellerby, Richard; Neill, Craig] Univ Bergen, Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, N-5007 Bergen, Norway; [Bellerby, Richard] Norwegian Inst Water Res, N-5006 Bergen, Norway; [Berg, Gry Mine; Mills, Matthew M.] Stanford Univ, Dept Environm Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Croot, Peter; Hoffmann, Linn J.] Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Croot, Peter] Natl Univ Ireland, Sch Nat Sci, Galway, Ireland; [Henjes, Joachim] Phytolut GmbH, D-28759 Bremen, Germany; [Herndl, Gerhard J.] Univ Vienna, Dept Marine Biol, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Leach, Harry] Univ Liverpool, Sch Environm Sci, Liverpool L69 3GP, Merseyside, England; [Neill, Craig] Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org, Wealth Oceans Flagship, Hobart, Tas 7000, Australia; [Peeken, Ilka] Univ Bremen, MARUM Ctr Marine Environm Sci, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Roettgers, Ruediger] Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Ctr Mat & Coastal Res, Inst Coastal Res, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany; [Sachs, Oliver] Eberhard & Partner AG, CH-5000 Aarau, Switzerland; [Schmidt, Maike M.] Univ Bremen, Ctr Biomol Interact Bremen, FB 2, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Schwarz, Jill] Univ Plymouth, Sch Marine Sci & Engn, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England","Smetacek, V (reprint author), Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Handelshafen 12, D-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany.",victor.smetacek@awi.de; christine.klaas@awi.de,"; Hoffmann, Linn/I-6042-2012; Herndl, Gerhard/B-1513-2013; Arrieta, Jesus/B-1226-2008; Croot, Peter/C-8460-2009; Losch, Martin/S-5896-2016","Strass, Volker/0000-0002-7539-1400; Montresor, Marina/0000-0002-2475-1787; Cisewski, Boris/0000-0002-1130-6107; Hoffmann, Linn/0000-0001-9175-6097; Herndl, Gerhard/0000-0002-2223-2852; Arrieta, Jesus/0000-0002-0190-6950; Croot, Peter/0000-0003-1396-0601; Losch, Martin/0000-0002-3824-5244; Sauter, Eberhard/0000-0001-7954-952X; Peeken, Ilka/0000-0003-1531-1664; Hoffmann, Linn/0000-0003-0242-4686",Cnes,"We thank C.

However, this poses a risk to the fetus, so one must make a decision that weighs the desire for genetic information against the risk of an adverse outcome due to hazards of the testing process. These issues are not required to be coupled, and it would be desirable to discover genetic information about the fetus without incurring a health risk. Here we demonstrate that it is possible to non-invasively sequence the entire prenatal genome. Our results show that molecular counting of parental haplotypes in maternal plasma by shotgun sequencing of maternal plasma DNA allows the inherited fetal genome to be deciphered non-invasively. We also applied the counting principle directly to each allele in the fetal exome by performing exome capture on maternal plasma DNA before shotgun sequencing. This approach enables non-invasive exome screening of clinically relevant and deleterious alleles that were paternally inherited or had arisen as de novo germline mutations, and complements the haplotype counting approach to provide a comprehensive view of the fetal genome. Non-invasive determination of the fetal genome may ultimately facilitate the diagnosis of all inherited and de novo genetic disease.","[Fan, H.

Survivors of acute coronary syndromes have a high risk of recurrent events for unknown reasons. Here we show that the systemic response to ischaemic injury aggravates chronic atherosclerosis. After myocardial infarction or stroke, Apoe(-/-) mice developed larger atherosclerotic lesions with a more advanced morphology. This disease acceleration persisted over many weeks and was associated with markedly increased monocyte recruitment. Seeking the source of surplus monocytes in plaques, we found that myocardial infarction liberated haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from bone marrow niches via sympathetic nervous system signalling. The progenitors then seeded the spleen, yielding a sustained boost in monocyte production. These observations provide new mechanistic insight into atherogenesis and provide a novel therapeutic opportunity to mitigate disease progression.","[Dutta, Partha; Courties, Gabriel; Leuschner, Florian; Gorbatov, Rostic; Robbins, Clinton S.; Iwamoto, Yoshiko; Thompson, Brian; Carlson, Alicia L.; Heidt, Timo; Majmudar, Maulik D.; Etzrodt, Martin; Waterman, Peter; Stone, James R.; Vinegoni, Claudio; Pittet, Mikael J.; Lin, Charles P.; Swirski, Filip K.; Weissleder, Ralph; Nahrendorf, Matthias] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Dutta, Partha; Courties, Gabriel; Leuschner, Florian; Gorbatov, Rostic; Robbins, Clinton S.; Iwamoto, Yoshiko; Thompson, Brian; Carlson, Alicia L.; Heidt, Timo; Majmudar, Maulik D.; Etzrodt, Martin; Waterman, Peter; Stone, James R.; Vinegoni, Claudio; Pittet, Mikael J.; Lin, Charles P.; Swirski, Filip K.; Weissleder, Ralph; Nahrendorf, Matthias] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Wei, Ying; Moskowitz, Michael A.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Radiol,Stroke & Neurovasc Regulat Lab, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Wei, Ying; Moskowitz, Michael A.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Neurol,Stroke & Neurovasc Regulat Lab, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Leuschner, Florian; Katus, Hugo A.] Med Univ Hosp Heidelberg, Dept Cardiol, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Majmudar, Maulik D.; Libby, Peter] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Div Cardiovasc, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Lasitschka, Felix] Univ Heidelberg Hosp, Inst Pathol, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Waring, Michael T.; Chicoine, Adam T.] MIT & Harvard Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ragon Inst MGH, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Waring, Michael T.; Chicoine, Adam T.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chevy Chase, MD 20815 USA; [van der Laan, Anja M.; Piek, Jan J.] Univ Amsterdam, Acad Med Ctr, Dept Cardiol, NL-1105 AZ Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Niessen, Hans W.

A subset of these samples (97) underwent low-depth-of-coverage whole-genome sequencing. In total, 16% of colorectal carcinomas were found to be hypermutated: three-quarters of these had the expected high microsatellite instability, usually with hypermethylation and MLH1 silencing, and one-quarter had somatic mismatch-repair gene and polymerase e (POLE) mutations. Excluding the hypermutated cancers, colon and rectum cancers were found to have considerably similar patterns of genomic alteration. Twenty-four genes were significantly mutated, and in addition to the expected APC, TP53, SMAD4, PIK3CA and KRAS mutations, we found frequent mutations in ARID1A, SOX9 and FAM123B. Recurrent copy-number alterations include potentially drug-targetable amplifications of ERBB2 and newly discovered amplification of IGF2. Recurrent chromosomal translocations include the fusion of NAV2 and WNT pathway member TCF7L1. Integrative analyses suggest new markers for aggressive colorectal carcinoma and an important role for MYC-directed transcriptional activation and repression.","[Hadjipanayis, Angela; Chen, Peng-Chieh; Seidman, Jonathan; Kucherlapati, Raju] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Donehower, Lawrence A.; Creighton, Chad J.; Sivachenko, Andrey] Baylor Coll Med, Human Genome Sequencing Ctr, Dan L Duncan Canc Ctr, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Gunaratne, Preethi] Univ Houston, Dept Biol & Biochem, Houston, TX 77204 USA; [Lawrence, Michael S.; Voet, Douglas; Jing, Rui; Cibulskis, Kristian; Stojanov, Petar; McKenna, Aaron; Lander, Eric S.; Gabriel, Stacey; Getz, Gad; Bass, Adam J.; Ramos, Alex H.; Saksena, Gordon; Cherniack, Andrew D.; Schumacher, Stephen E.; Tabak, Barbara; Carter, Scott L.; Pho, Nam H.; Nguyen, Huy; Onofrio, Robert C.; Crenshaw, Andrew; Ardlie, Kristin; Beroukhim, Rameen; Winckler, Wendy; Meyerson, Matthew; Chin, Lynda; Noble, Michael; Voet, Doug; Gehlenborg, Nils; DiCara, Daniel; Zhang, Juinhua; Zhang, Hailei; Wu, Chang-Jiun; Liu, Spring Yingchun; Shukla, Sachet; Zhou, Lihua; Sivachenko, Andrey; Lin, Pei; Nazaire, Marc-Danie; Robinson, Jim; Thorvaldsdottir, Helga; Mesirov, Jill] MIT, Eli & Edythe L Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Voet, Douglas; Jing, Rui; Cibulskis, Kristian; Stojanov, Petar; McKenna, Aaron; Lander, Eric S.; Gabriel, Stacey; Getz, Gad; Bass, Adam J.; Ramos, Alex H.; Saksena, Gordon; Cherniack, Andrew D.; Schumacher, Stephen E.; Tabak, Barbara; Carter, Scott L.; Pho, Nam H.; Nguyen, Huy; Onofrio, Robert C.; Crenshaw, Andrew; Ardlie, Kristin; Beroukhim, Rameen; Winckler, Wendy; Meyerson, Matthew; Chin, Lynda; Noble, Michael; Voet, Doug; Gehlenborg, Nils; DiCara, Daniel; Zhang, Juinhua; Zhang, Hailei; Wu, Chang-Jiun; Liu, Spring Yingchun; Shukla, Sachet; Zhou, Lihua; Sivachenko, Andrey; Lin, Pei; Nazaire, Marc-Danie; Robinson, Jim; Thorvaldsdottir, Helga; Mesirov, Jill] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Lander, Eric S.] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Lander, Eric S.] Harvard Univ, Dept Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Ding, Li; Fulton, Robert S.; Koboldt, Daniel C.; Wylie, Todd; Walker, Jason; Dooling, David J.; Fulton, Lucinda; Delehaunty, Kim D.; Fronick, Catrina C.; Demeter, Ryan; Mardis, Elaine R.; Wilson, Richard K.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Genome Inst, St Louis, MO 63108 USA; [Ding, Li; Dooling, David J.; Mardis, Elaine R.; Wilson, Richard K.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, St Louis, MO 63108 USA; [Mardis, Elaine R.; Wilson, Richard K.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Siteman Canc Ctr, St Louis, MO 63108 USA; [Chu, Andy; Chun, Hye-Jung E.; Mungall, Andrew J.; Pleasance, Erin; Robertson, A.

The rarity of spirals has been explained as a result of disks being dynamically 'hot' at z > 2 (refs 2-5), which may instead favour the formation of commonly observed clumpy structures(6-10). Alternatively, current instrumentation may simply not be sensitive enough to detect spiral structures comparable to those in the modern Universe(11). At z < 2, the velocity dispersion of disks decreases(12), and spiral galaxies are more numerous by z approximate to 1 (refs 7, 13-15). Here we report observations of the grand-design spiral galaxy Q2343-BX442 at z = 2.18. Spectroscopy of ionized gas shows that the disk is dynamically hot, implying an uncertain origin for the spiral structure. The kinematics of the galaxy are consistent with a thick disk undergoing a minor merger, which can drive the formation of short-lived spiral structure(16-18). A duty cycle of <100 Myr for such tidally induced spiral structure in a hot massive disk is consistent with its rarity.","[Law, David R.] Univ Toronto, Dunlap Inst Astron & Astrophys, Toronto, ON M5S 3H4, Canada; [Shapley, Alice E.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Phys & Astron, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Steidel, Charles C.] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Reddy, Naveen A.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Phys & Astron, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Christensen, Charlotte R.] Steward Observ, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Erb, Dawn K.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Phys, Milwaukee, WI 53211 USA","Law, DR (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Dunlap Inst Astron & Astrophys, 50 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3H4, Canada.",drlaw@di.utoronto.ca,,,Space Telescope Science Institute [GO-11694]; NASA [NAS 5-26555]; David and Lucile Packard Foundation; US National Science Foundation [AST-1009452],"D.R.L and C.C.S have been supported by grant GO-11694 from the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., for NASA, under contract NAS 5-26555.

Clustering is a recurrent feature in light nuclei, from beryllium to nickel(1-3). Cluster structures are typically observed as excited states close to the corresponding decay threshold; the origin of this phenomenon lies in the effective nuclear interaction, but the detailed mechanism of clustering in nuclei has not yet been fully understood. Here we use the theoretical framework of energy-density functionals(4,5), encompassing both cluster and quantum liquid-drop aspects of nuclei, to show that conditions for cluster formation can in part be traced back to the depth of the confining nuclear potential. For the illustrative example of neon-20, we show that the depth of the potential determines the energy spacings between single-nucleon orbitals in deformed nuclei, the localization of the corresponding wavefunctions and, therefore, the degree of nucleonic density clustering. Relativistic functionals, in particular, are characterized by deep single-nucleon potentials. When compared to non-relativistic functionals that yield similar ground-state properties (binding energy, deformation, radii), they predict the occurrence of much more pronounced cluster structures. More generally, clustering is considered as a transitional phenomenon between crystalline and quantum-liquid phases of fermionic systems.","[Khan, E.] Univ Paris 11, CNRS, IN2P3, Inst Phys Nucl, F-91406 Orsay, France; [Ebran, J. -P.] CEA DAM DIF, F-91297 Arpajon, France; [Niksic, T.; Vretenar, D.] Univ Zagreb, Fac Sci, Dept Phys, Zagreb 10000, Croatia","Khan, E (reprint author), Univ Paris 11, CNRS, IN2P3, Inst Phys Nucl, F-91406 Orsay, France.",khan@ipno.in2p3.fr,"Vretenar, Dario/N-8158-2013; Niksic, Tamara/L-7343-2013","Vretenar, Dario/0000-0002-2097-6567; ","Institut Universitaire de France; Croatian Ministry of Science, Education and Sport [1191005-1010]","This work was supported by the Institut Universitaire de France and by the Croatian Ministry of Science, Education and Sport-project 1191005-1010.

The transition can arise from underlying microscopic interactions among the charge, lattice, orbital and spin degrees of freedom, the complexity of which leads to multiple phase-transition pathways. For example, in many transition metal oxides, the insulator-metal transition has been achieved with external stimuli, including temperature, light, electric field, mechanical strain or magnetic field(2-7). Vanadium dioxide is particularly intriguing because both the lattice and on-site Coulomb repulsion contribute to the insulator-to-metal transition at 340K (ref. 8). Thus, although the precise microscopic origin of the phase transition remains elusive, vanadium dioxide serves as a testbed for correlated-electron phase-transition dynamics. Here we report the observation of an insulator-metal transition in vanadium dioxide induced by a terahertz electric field. This is achieved using metamaterial-enhanced picosecond, high-field terahertz pulses to reduce the Coulomb-induced potential barrier for carrier transport(9). A nonlinear metamaterial response is observed through the phase transition, demonstrating that high-field terahertz pulses provide alternative pathways to induce collective electronic and structural rearrangements. The metamaterial resonators play a dual role, providing sub-wavelength field enhancement that locally drives the nonlinear response, and global sensitivity to the local changes, thereby enabling macroscopic observation of the dynamics(10,11). This methodology provides a powerful platform to investigate low-energy dynamics in condensed matter and, further, demonstrates that integration of metamaterials with complex matter is a viable pathway to realize functional nonlinear electromagnetic composites.","[Hwang, Harold Y.; Nelson, Keith A.] MIT, Dept Chem, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Liu, Mengkun; Strikwerda, Andrew C.; Keiser, George R.; Sternbach, Aaron J.; Averitt, Richard D.] Boston Univ, Dept Phys, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Tao, Hu; Omenetto, Fiorenzo G.] Tufts Univ, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [Fan, Kebin; Zhang, Xin] Boston Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [West, Kevin G.; Kittiwatanakul, Salinporn; Lu, Jiwei; Wolf, Stuart A.] Univ Virginia, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; [Wolf, Stuart A.] Univ Virginia, Dept Phys, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA","Nelson, KA (reprint author), MIT, Dept Chem, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",kanelson@mit.edu; raveritt@buphy.bu.edu,"Fan, Kebin/B-2984-2012; Tao, Hu/C-1528-2013; Zhang, Xin/B-9244-2009","Fan, Kebin/0000-0002-0275-0871; Zhang, Xin/0000-0002-4413-5084; Strikwerda, Andrew/0000-0001-8212-5891",DOE-BES [DE-FG02-09ER46643]; ONR [N00014-09-1-1103],We acknowledge support from DOE-BES under grant DE-FG02-09ER46643 and from ONR grant N00014-09-1-1103.,,30,332,334,63,560,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,19-Jul,2012,487,7407,,,,,345,348,,10.1038/nature11231,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,975JB,WOS:000306506500038,22801506.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,richard d.,averitt,na,na,na,na,na

Thus far, dendritic liquid crystals(2), ABC-star polymers(3), colloids(4) and inorganic nanoparticles(5) have been reported to yield quasicrystals. These quasicrystals offer larger length scales than intermetallic quasicrystals (a few angstroms)(1,6), thus potentially leading to optical applications through the realization of a complete photonic bandgap induced via multiple scattering of light waves in virtually all directions(7-9). However, the materials remain far from structurally ideal, in contrast to their intermetallic counterparts, and fine control over the structure through a self-organization process has yet to be attained. Here we use the well-established self-assembly of surfactant micelles to produce a new class of mesoporous silicas, which exhibit 12-fold (dodecagonal) symmetry in both electron diffraction and morphology. Each particle reveals, in the 12-fold cross-section, an analogue of dodecagonal quasicrystals in the centre surrounded by 12 fans of crystalline domains in the peripheral part. The quasicrystallinity has been verified by selected-area electron diffraction and quantitative phason strain analyses on transmission electron microscope images obtained from the central region. We argue that the structure forms through a non-equilibrium growth process, wherein the competition between different micellar configurations has a central role in tuning the structure. A simple theoretical model successfully reproduces the observed features and thus establishes a link between the formation process and the resulting structure.","[Xiao, Changhong; Miyasaka, Keiichi; Sakamoto, Yasuhiro; Terasaki, Osamu] Stockholm Univ, Bezelii Ctr EXSELENT Porous Mat, Dept Mat & Environm Chem, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Fujita, Nobuhisa] Tohoku Univ, Inst Multidisciplinary Res Adv Mat, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan; [Miyasaka, Keiichi; Terasaki, Osamu] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch EEWS WCU, Taejon 305701, South Korea; [Sakamoto, Yasuhiro] Osaka Prefecture Univ, Nanosci & Nanotechnol Res Ctr, Sakai, Osaka 5998570, Japan","Terasaki, O (reprint author), Stockholm Univ, Bezelii Ctr EXSELENT Porous Mat, Dept Mat & Environm Chem, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",terasaki@mmk.su.se,"Sakamoto, Yasuhiro/G-8289-2012",,"Swedish Research Council (VR); Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST); Berzelii EXSELENT; Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation; WCU programme, Korea [R-31-2008-000-10055-0]; JSPS [23710132]; MEXT, Japan","We thank K.

They also provide insight into how the mantle has evolved, geochemically and dynamically, since the formation of Earth(2). Melt production in the shallow mantle is quite well understood, but deeper melting near the core-mantle boundary remains controversial. Modelling the dynamic behaviour of deep, partially molten mantle requires knowledge of the density contrast between solid and melt fractions. Although both positive and negative melt buoyancies can produce major chemical segregation between different geochemical reservoirs, each type of buoyancy yields drastically different geodynamical models. Ascent or descent of liquids in a partially molten deep mantle should contribute to surface volcanism or production of a deep magma ocean, respectively. We investigated phase relations in a partially molten chondritic-type material under deep-mantle conditions. Here we show that the iron partition coefficient between aluminium-bearing (Mg,Fe)SiO3 perovskite and liquid is between 0.45 and 0.6, so iron is not as incompatible with deep-mantle minerals as has been reported previously(3). Calculated solid and melt density contrasts suggest that melt generated at the core-mantle boundary should be buoyant, and hence should segregate upwards. In the framework of the magma oceans induced by large meteoritic impacts on early Earth, our results imply that the magma crystallization should push the liquids towards the surface and form a deep solid residue depleted in incompatible elements.","[Andrault, Denis; Lo Nigro, Giacomo; Devidal, Jean-Luc] Univ Clermont Ferrand, CNRS, IRD, Lab Magmas & Volcans, F-63038 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Petitgirard, Sylvain; Veronesi, Giulia; Garbarino, Gaston; Mezouar, Mohamed] European Synchrotron Radiat Facil, F-38043 Grenoble, France","Andrault, D (reprint author), Univ Clermont Ferrand, CNRS, IRD, Lab Magmas & Volcans, F-63038 Clermont Ferrand, France.",d.andrault@opgc.univ-bpclermont.fr,"Garbarino, Gaston/D-1807-2013","Veronesi, Giulia/0000-0001-9228-6082",French National Centre for Scientific Research's National Institute for Earth Sciences and Astronomy; ESRF; European C2C programme,"We thank N.

Ectotherms show pronounced annual cycles of growth arrest that correlate with a decrease in body temperature and metabolic rate; endotherms are assumed to grow continuously until they attain maturity because of their constant high body temperature and sustained metabolic rate(1,2). This apparent dichotomy has driven the argument that zonal bone denotes ectotherm-like physiologies, thus fuelling the controversy on dinosaur thermophysiology and the evolution of endothermy in birds and mammal-like reptiles(1-4). Here we show, from a comprehensive global study of wild ruminants from tropical to polar environments, that cyclical growth is a universal trait of homoeothermic endotherms. Growth is arrested during the unfavourable season concurrently with decreases in body temperature, metabolic rate and bone-growth-mediating plasma insulin-like growth factor-1 levels, forming part of a plesiomorphic thermometabolic strategy for energy conservation. Conversely, bouts of intense tissue growth coincide with peak metabolic rates and correlated hormonal changes at the beginning of the favourable season, indicating an increased efficiency in acquiring and using seasonal resources. Our study supplies the strongest evidence so far that homeothermic endotherms arrest growth seasonally, which precludes the use of lines of arrested growth as an argument in support of ectothermy. However, high growth rates are a distinctive trait of mammals, suggesting the capacity for endogenous heat generation. The ruminant annual cycle provides an extant model on which to base inferences regarding the thermophysiology of dinosaurs and other extinct taxa.","[Koehler, Meike] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, ICREA, Inst Catala Paleontol Miquel Crusafont, Bellaterra 08193, Spain; [Aanes, Ronny] Norwegian Polar Res Inst, Fram Ctr, NO-9296 Tromso, Norway; [Aanes, Ronny] Norwegian Directorate Nat Management, NO-7047 Trondheim, Norway","Kohler, M (reprint author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, ICREA, Inst Catala Paleontol Miquel Crusafont, Bellaterra 08193, Spain.",meike.kohler@icp.cat,"Jordana, Xavier/L-9301-2014; Jordana, Xavier/G-7537-2017","Jordana, Xavier/0000-0001-8990-4388; Jordana, Xavier/0000-0002-6016-6630; Kohler, Meike/0000-0001-9228-3164","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [CGL2008-06204/BTE, CGL2011-24685, BES-2009-02641, JCI-2010-08157]; Norwegian Research Council [NORKLIMA 178561/S30]; ICREA","We thank Th.

Because broad-spectrum insecticides kill arthropod natural enemies that provide biological control of pests, the decrease in use of insecticide sprays associated with Bt crops could enhance biocontrol services(7-12). However, this hypothesis has not been tested in terms of long-term landscape-level impacts(10). On the basis of data from 1990 to 2010 at 36 sites in six provinces of northern China, we show here a marked increase in abundance of three types of generalist arthropod predators (ladybirds, lacewings and spiders) and a decreased abundance of aphid pests associated with widespread adoption of Bt cotton and reduced insecticide sprays in this crop. We also found evidence that the predators might provide additional biocontrol services spilling over from Bt cotton fields onto neighbouring crops (maize, peanut and soybean). Our work extends results from general studies evaluating ecological effects of Bt crops(1-4,6,12,13) by demonstrating that such crops can promote biocontrol services in agricultural landscapes.","[Lu, Yanhui; Wu, Kongming; Guo, Yuyuan] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Plant Protect, State Key Lab Biol Plant Dis & Insect Pests, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Yuying] Natl Agrotech Extens & Serv Ctr, Beijing 100026, Peoples R China; [Desneux, Nicolas] French Natl Inst Agr Res INRA, UMR1355, ISA, F-06903 Sophia Antipolis, France","Wu, KM (reprint author), Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Plant Protect, State Key Lab Biol Plant Dis & Insect Pests, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",kmwu@ippcaas.cn,"Desneux, Nicolas/J-6262-2013",,Key Project for Breeding Genetically Modified Organisms [2011ZX08012-004]; International Science and Technology Cooperation Project [2010DFA32200],We thank the agricultural technicians of the 36 surveyed locations for providing data sets from cotton fields; W.

Both extrinsic environmental factors (for example, resource availability, climate) and intrinsic lineage-specific traits (for example, behavioural or morphological traits, genetic architecture) influence diversification, but few studies have addressed how such factors interact. Radiations of cichlid fishes in the African Great Lakes provide some of the most dramatic cases of species diversification. However, most cichlid lineages in African lakes have not undergone adaptive radiations. Here we compile data on cichlid colonization and diversification in 46 African lakes, along with lake environmental features and information about the traits of colonizing cichlid lineages, to investigate why adaptive radiation does and does not occur. We find that extrinsic environmental factors related to ecological opportunity and intrinsic lineage-specific traits related to sexual selection both strongly influence whether cichlids radiate. Cichlids are more likely to radiate in deep lakes, in regions with more incident solar radiation and in lakes where there has been more time for diversification. Weak or negative associations between diversification and lake surface area indicate that cichlid speciation is not constrained by area, in contrast to diversification in many terrestrial taxa(3). Among the suite of intrinsic traits that we investigate, sexual dichromatism, a surrogate for the intensity of sexual selection, is consistently positively associated with diversification. Thus, for cichlids, it is the coincidence between ecological opportunity and sexual selection that best predicts whether adaptive radiation will occur. These findings suggest that adaptive radiation is predictable, but only when species traits and environmental factors are jointly considered.","[Wagner, Catherine E.; Seehausen, Ole] EAWAG Ctr Ecol Evolut & Biogeochem, Dept Fish Ecol & Evolut, CH-6047 Kastanienbaum, Switzerland; [Wagner, Catherine E.; Seehausen, Ole] Univ Bern, Inst Ecol & Evolut, Dept Aquat Ecol, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Wagner, Catherine E.] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Wagner, Catherine E.] Cornell Univ, Ornithol Lab, Fuller Evolutionary Biol Program, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Harmon, Luke J.] Univ Idaho, Dept Biol Sci, Moscow, ID 83844 USA","Wagner, CE (reprint author), EAWAG Ctr Ecol Evolut & Biogeochem, Dept Fish Ecol & Evolut, CH-6047 Kastanienbaum, Switzerland.",catherine.wagner@eawag.ch; ole.seehausen@eawag.ch,"Wagner, Catherine/F-4692-2012","Wagner, Catherine/0000-0001-8585-6120",National Center for Research Resources [5P20RR016448-10]; National Institute of General Medical Sciences from the National Institutes of Health [8 P20 GM103397-10]; Swiss National Science Foundation [31003A-118293]; US National Science Foundation [DEB 0919499],"We thank A.

Processes involving re-organization of pre-existing genes, notably after gene duplication, have been extensively described(1,2). In contrast, de novo gene birth remains poorly understood, mainly because translation of sequences devoid of genes, or 'non-genic' sequences, is expected to produce insignificant polypeptides rather than proteins with specific biological functions(1,3-6). Here we formalize an evolutionary model according to which functional genes evolve de novo through transitory proto-genes(4) generated by widespread translational activity in non-genic sequences. Testing this model at the genome scale in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we detect translation of hundreds of short species-specific open reading frames (ORFs) located in non-genic sequences. These translation events seem to provide adaptive potential(7), as suggested by their differential regulation upon stress and by signatures of retention by natural selection. In line with our model, we establish that S. cerevisiae ORFs can be placed within an evolutionary continuum ranging from non-genic sequences to genes. We identify similar to 1,900 candidate proto-genes among S. cerevisiae ORFs and find that de novo gene birth from such a reservoir may be more prevalent than sporadic gene duplication. Our work illustrates that evolution exploits seemingly dispensable sequences to generate adaptive functional innovation.","[Carvunis, Anne-Ruxandra; Rolland, Thomas; Calderwood, Michael A.; Simonis, Nicolas; Charloteaux, Benoit; Barbette, Justin; Santhanam, Balaji; Cusick, Michael E.; Vidal, Marc] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Ctr Canc Syst Biol CCSB, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Carvunis, Anne-Ruxandra; Rolland, Thomas; Calderwood, Michael A.; Simonis, Nicolas; Charloteaux, Benoit; Barbette, Justin; Santhanam, Balaji; Cusick, Michael E.; Vidal, Marc] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Biol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Carvunis, Anne-Ruxandra; Rolland, Thomas; Calderwood, Michael A.; Simonis, Nicolas; Charloteaux, Benoit; Barbette, Justin; Santhanam, Balaji; Cusick, Michael E.; Vidal, Marc] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Carvunis, Anne-Ruxandra; Thierry-Mieg, Nicolas] UJF Grenoble 1, CNRS, TIMC IMAG, UMR 5525,Computat & Math Biol Grp, F-38031 Grenoble, France; [Wapinski, Ilan] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Yildirim, Muhammed A.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Yildirim, Muhammed A.] Ctr Int Dev, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Charloteaux, Benoit] Univ Liege, GIGA R, Unit Anim Genom, B-4000 Liege, Wallonia Brusse, Belgium; [Hidalgo, Cesar A.] MIT, MIT Media Lab, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Brar, Gloria A.; Weissman, Jonathan S.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Cell & Mol Pharmacol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Brar, Gloria A.; Weissman, Jonathan S.] Calif Inst Quantitat Biosci, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Regev, Aviv] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Regev, Aviv] MIT, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Charloteaux, Benoit] Univ Liege, Fac Vet Med, B-4000 Liege, Belgium","Vidal, M (reprint author), Dana Farber Canc Inst, Ctr Canc Syst Biol CCSB, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",marc_vidal@dfci.harvard.edu,"Yildirim, Muhammed/J-3695-2014; Thierry-Mieg, Nicolas/M-6007-2014; Calderwood, Mike/B-2475-2014","Yildirim, Muhammed/0000-0003-2826-1766; Thierry-Mieg, Nicolas/0000-0002-7667-2853; Calderwood, Mike/0000-0001-6475-1418; /0000-0002-6031-5982; Carvunis, Anne-Ruxandra/0000-0002-6474-6413",National Institute of Health; Scientific Interface from the Burroughs Wellcome Fund; Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI); American Cancer Society [117945-PF-09-136-01-RMC]; National Human Genome Research Institute [R01-HG006061],"We thank L.

Here we show that SHARP1 (also known as BHLHE41 or DEC2) is a crucial regulator of the invasive and metastatic phenotype in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), one of the most aggressive types of breast cancer. SHARP1 is regulated by the p63 metastasis suppressor and inhibits TNBC aggressiveness through inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) and HIF-2 alpha (HIFs). SHARP1 opposes HIF-dependent TNBC cell migration in vitro, and invasive or metastatic behaviours in vivo. SHARP1 is required, and sufficient, to limit expression of HIF-target genes. In primary TNBC, endogenous SHARP1 levels are inversely correlated with those of HIF targets. Mechanistically, SHARP1 binds to HIFs and promotes HIF proteasomal degradation by serving as the HIF-presenting factor to the proteasome. This process is independent of pVHL (von Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor), hypoxia and the ubiquitination machinery. SHARP1 therefore determines the intrinsic instability of HIF proteins to act in parallel to, and cooperate with, oxygen levels. This work sheds light on the mechanisms and pathways by which TNBC acquires invasiveness and metastatic propensity.","[Montagner, Marco; Enzo, Elena; Zanconato, Francesca; Cordenonsi, Michelangelo; Piccolo, Stefano] Univ Padua, Sch Med, Dept Med Biotechnol, I-35131 Padua, Italy; [Forcato, Mattia; Bicciato, Silvio] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Biomed Sci, Ctr Genome Res, I-41100 Modena, Italy; [Parenti, Anna] Univ Padua, Sect Pathol, Dept Med Diagnost Sci & Special Therapies, I-35126 Padua, Italy; [Rampazzo, Elena; Basso, Giuseppe] Univ Padua, Dept Pediat, I-35128 Padua, Italy; [Leo, Genesio] Hosp San Bassiano, Div Anat Pathol, I-36061 Bassano Del Grappa, Italy; [Rosato, Antonio] Dept Surg Oncol & Gastroenterol, I-35126 Padua, Italy; [Rosato, Antonio] Ist Oncol Veneto IRCCS, I-35126 Padua, Italy","Piccolo, S (reprint author), Univ Padua, Sch Med, Dept Med Biotechnol, Viale Colombo 3, I-35131 Padua, Italy.",piccolo@bio.unipd.it,"Rosato, Antonio/E-8626-2010; Bicciato, Silvio/C-9825-2009; Forcato, Mattia/B-7733-2015; Cordenonsi, Michelangelo/K-7692-2016","Rosato, Antonio/0000-0002-5263-8386; Bicciato, Silvio/0000-0002-1944-7078; Forcato, Mattia/0000-0002-7383-6576; Cordenonsi, Michelangelo/0000-0002-8253-5724; BASSO, GIUSEPPE/0000-0002-2634-9302",FIRC (Federazione Italiana Ricerca Cancro); Cariparo PhD fellowship; AIRC (Italian Association for Cancer Research); Italian Welfare Ministry; AIRC (Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro); Fondazione Citta della Speranza; MIUR (Ministero dell'Istruzione dell'Universita e della Ricerca Italia); PRIN grants; AIRC; HSFP; University of Padua; IIT Excellence grant; CNR-Miur Epigenetics Flagship project; Comitato Promotore Telethon,"We thank O.

Gag is a multidomain polyprotein including three conserved folded domains: MA (matrix), CA (capsid) and NC (nucleocapsid)(1). Assembly of an infectious virion proceeds in two stages(2). In the first stage, Gag oligomerization into a hexameric protein lattice leads to the formation of an incomplete, roughly spherical protein shell that buds through the plasma membrane of the infected cell to release an enveloped immature virus particle. In the second stage, cleavage of Gag by the viral protease leads to rearrangement of the particle interior, converting the non-infectious immature virus particle into a mature infectious virion. The immature Gag shell acts as the pivotal intermediate in assembly and is a potential target for anti-retroviral drugs both in inhibiting virus assembly and in disrupting virus maturation(3). However, detailed structural information on the immature Gag shell has not previously been available. For this reason it is unclear what protein conformations and interfaces mediate the interactions between domains and therefore the assembly of retrovirus particles, and what structural transitions are associated with retrovirus maturation. Here we solve the structure of the immature retroviral Gag shell from Mason-Pfizer monkey virus by combining cryo-electron microscopy and tomography. The 8-angstrom resolution structure permits the derivation of a pseudo-atomic model of CA in the immature retrovirus, which defines the protein interfaces mediating retrovirus assembly. We show that transition of an immature retrovirus into its mature infectious form involves marked rotations and translations of CA domains, that the roles of the amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal domains of CA in assembling the immature and mature hexameric lattices are exchanged, and that the CA interactions that stabilize the immature and mature viruses are almost completely distinct.","[Bharat, Tanmay A.

Initiation involves factor-driven assembly at a start codon of a messenger RNA of an elongation-competent 70S ribosomal particle (in bacteria) from separated 30S and 50S subunits and initiator transfer RNA. Here we establish in Escherichia coli, using direct single-molecule tracking, the timing of initiator tRNA, initiation factor 2 (IF2; encoded by infB) and 50S subunit joining during initiation. Our results show multiple pathways to initiation, with orders of arrival of tRNA and IF2 dependent on factor concentration and composition. IF2 accelerates 50S subunit joining and stabilizes the assembled 70S complex. Transition to elongation is gated by the departure of IF2 after GTP hydrolysis, allowing efficient arrival of elongator tRNAs to the second codon presented in the aminoacyl-tRNA binding site (A site). These experiments highlight the power of single-molecule approaches to delineate mechanisms in complex multicomponent systems.","[Tsai, Albert; Petrov, Alexey; Marshall, R.

It commonly leads to several major symptoms of depression, including dysregulated feeding behaviour, anhedonia and behavioural despair. Although hypotheses defining the neural pathophysiology of depression have been proposed, the critical synaptic adaptations in key brain circuits that mediate stress-induced depressive symptoms remain poorly understood. Here we show that chronic stress in mice decreases the strength of excitatory synapses on D1 dopamine receptor-expressing nucleus accumbens medium spiny neurons owing to activation of the melanocortin 4 receptor. Stress-elicited increases in behavioural measurements of anhedonia, but not increases in measurements of behavioural despair, are prevented by blocking these melanocortin 4 receptor-mediated synaptic changes in vivo. These results establish that stress-elicited anhedonia requires a neuropeptide-triggered, cell-type-specific synaptic adaptation in the nucleus accumbens and that distinct circuit adaptations mediate other major symptoms of stress-elicited depression.","[Lim, Byung Kook; Huang, Kee Wui; Grueter, Brad A.; Rothwell, Patrick E.; Malenka, Robert C.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Nancy Pritzker Lab, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Malenka, RC (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Nancy Pritzker Lab, 265 Campus Dr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",malenka@stanford.edu,,"Grueter, Brad/0000-0002-4224-3866; Rothwell, Patrick/0000-0003-0514-2510",Davis Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowship in Eating Disorders Research; National Institutes of Health,"We thank J.

Here we describe a low-cost DNA sequencing and haplotyping process, long fragment read (LFR) technology, which is similar to sequencing long single DNA molecules without cloning or separation of metaphase chromosomes. In this study, ten LFR libraries were made using only similar to 100 picograms of human DNA per sample. Up to 97% of the heterozygous single nucleotide variants were assembled into long haplotype contigs. Removal of false positive single nucleotide variants not phased by multiple LFR haplotypes resulted in a final genome error rate of 1 in 10 megabases.

The polymerization reaction was initiated by exposing crystals to 1 mM Mg2+ at pH 7.0, and stopped by freezing at desired time points for structural analysis. The substrates and two Mg2+ ions are aligned within 40 s, but the bond formation is not evident until 80 s. From 80 to 300 s structures show a mixture of decreasing substrate and increasing product of the nucleotidyl-transfer reaction. Transient electron densities indicate that deprotonation and an accompanying C2'-endo to C3'-endo conversion of the nucleophile 3'-OH are rate limiting.

The thread-like structure of this 'cosmic web' has been traced by galaxy redshift surveys for decades(2,3). More recently, the warm-hot intergalactic medium (a sparse plasma with temperatures of 10(5) kelvin to 10(7) kelvin) residing in low-redshift filaments has been observed in emission(4) and absorption(5,6). However, a reliable direct detection of the underlying dark-matter skeleton, which should contain more than half of all matter(7), has remained elusive, because earlier candidates for such detections(8-10) were either falsified(11,12) or suffered from low signal-to-noise ratios(8,10) and unphysical misalignments of dark and luminous matter(9,10). Here we report the detection of a dark-matter filament connecting the two main components of the Abell 222/223 supercluster system from its weak gravitational lensing signal, both in a non-parametric mass reconstruction and in parametric model fits. This filament is coincident with an overdensity of galaxies(10,13) and diffuse, soft-X-ray emission(4), and contributes a mass comparable to that of an additional galaxy cluster to the total mass of the supercluster. By combining this result with X-ray observations(4), we can place an upper limit of 0.09 on the hot gas fraction (the mass of X-ray-emitting gas divided by the total mass) in the filament.","[Dietrich, Joerg P.] Univ Michigan, Dept Phys, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Dietrich, Joerg P.] Univ Michigan, Michigan Ctr Theoret Phys, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Werner, Norbert; Simionescu, Aurora] Stanford Univ, Kavli Inst Particle Astrophys & Cosmol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Clowe, Douglas] Ohio Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Clippinger Lab 251B, Athens, OH 45701 USA; [Finoguenov, Alexis] Max Planck Inst Extraterr Phys, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Kitching, Tom] Univ Edinburgh, Royal Observ, Inst Astron, Edinburgh EH9 3HJ, Midlothian, Scotland; [Miller, Lance] Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Oxford OX1 3RH, England","Dietrich, JP (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Dept Phys, 450 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",jorgd@umich.edu,,"Dietrich, Jorg/0000-0002-8134-9591",NSF [AST 0807304]; National Aeronautics and Space Administration [PF9-00070],J.P.D. was supported by NSF grant AST 0807304.

Rheological experiments have investigated how such thickening arises under shear, and linked it to hydrodynamic interactions(1,3) or granular dilation(2,4). However, neither of these mechanisms alone can explain the ability of suspensions to generate very large, positive normal stresses under impact. To illustrate the phenomenon, such stresses can be large enough to allow a person to run across a suspension without sinking, and far exceed the upper limit observed under shear or extension(2,4,6,7). Here we show that these stresses originate from an impact-generated solidification front that transforms an initially compressible particle matrix into a rapidly growing jammed region, ultimately leading to extraordinary amounts of momentum absorption. Using high-speed videography, embedded force sensing and X-ray imaging, we capture the detailed dynamics of this process as it decelerates a metal rod hitting a suspension of cornflour (cornstarch) in water. We develop a model for the dynamic solidification and its effect on the surrounding suspension that reproduces the observed behaviour quantitatively. Our findings suggest that prior interpretations of the impact resistance as dominated by shear thickening need to be revisited.","[Waitukaitis, Scott R.; Jaeger, Heinrich M.] Univ Chicago, James Franck Inst, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Waitukaitis, Scott R.; Jaeger, Heinrich M.] Univ Chicago, Dept Phys, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Waitukaitis, SR (reprint author), Univ Chicago, James Franck Inst, 5640 S Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",swaitukaitis@uchicago.edu,,,NSF through MRSEC programme [DMR-0820054]; US Army Research Office [W911NF-12-1-0182]; Millikan fellowship,"We thank E.

It has been previously observed with a magnitude of microvolts per kelvin in magnetically ordered materials, ferromagnetic metals(1), semiconductors(2) and insulators(3). Here we describe a signal in a non-magnetic semiconductor (InSb) that has the hallmarks of being produced by the spin Seebeck effect, but is three orders of magnitude larger (millivolts per kelvin). We refer to the phenomenon that produces it as the giant spin Seebeck effect. Quantizing magnetic fields spin-polarize conduction electrons in semiconductors by means of Zeeman splitting, which spin-orbit coupling amplifies by a factor of similar to 25 in InSb. We propose that the giant spin Seebeck effect is mediated by phonon-electron drag, which changes the electrons' momentum and directly modifies the spin-splitting energy through spin-orbit interactions. Owing to the simultaneously strong phonon-electron drag and spin-orbit coupling in InSb, the magnitude of the giant spin Seebeck voltage is comparable to the largest known classical thermopower values.","[Jaworski, C.

In contrast, most synthetic materials are incapable of continuous self-monitoring and self-regulating behaviour owing to their limited single-directional chemomechanical(7-12) or mechanochemical(13,14) modes. Applying the concept of homeostasis to the design of autonomous materials(15) would have substantial impacts in areas ranging from medical implants that help stabilize bodily functions to 'smart' materials that regulate energy usage(2,16,17). Here we present a versatile strategy for creating self-regulating, self-powered, homeostatic materials capable of precisely tailored chemo-mechanochemical feedback loops on the nano- or microscale. We design a bilayer system with hydrogel-supported, catalyst-bearing microstructures, which are separated from a reactant-containing 'nutrient' layer. Reconfiguration of the gel in response to a stimulus induces the reversible actuation of the microstructures into and out of the nutrient layer, and serves as a highly precise 'on/off' switch for chemical reactions. We apply this design to trigger organic, inorganic and biochemical reactions that undergo reversible, repeatable cycles synchronized with the motion of the microstructures and the driving external chemical stimulus. By exploiting a continuous feedback loop between various exothermic catalytic reactions in the nutrient layer and the mechanical action of the temperature-responsive gel, we then create exemplary autonomous, self-sustained homeostatic systems that maintain a user-defined parameter-temperature-in a narrow range. The experimental results are validated using computational modelling that qualitatively captures the essential features of the self-regulating behaviour and provides additional criteria for the optimization of the homeostatic function, subsequently confirmed experimentally. This design is highly customizable owing to the broad choice of chemistries, tunable mechanics and its physical simplicity, and may lead to a variety of applications in autonomous systems with chemo-mechano-chemical transduction at their core.","[He, Ximin; Aizenberg, Joanna] Harvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [He, Ximin; Aizenberg, Michael; Aizenberg, Joanna] Harvard Univ, Wyss Inst Biologically Inspired Engn, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kuksenok, Olga; Balazs, Anna C.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Chem & Petr Engn, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Zarzar, Lauren D.; Shastri, Ankita; Aizenberg, Joanna] Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Aizenberg, J (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",jaiz@seas.harvard.edu,,,US DOE [DE-SC0005247]; US NSF [CMMI-1124839],"We thank P.

Around 14 thousand years ago, meltwater pulse 1A (MWP-1A), the largest of these events, produced a sea level rise of 14-18 metres over 350 years(3). Although this enormous surge of water certainly originated from retreating ice sheets, there is no consensus on the geographical source or underlying physical mechanisms governing the rapid sea level rise(4-6). Here we present an ice-sheet modelling simulation in which the separation of the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets in North America produces a meltwater pulse corresponding to MWP-1A. Another meltwater pulse is produced when the Labrador and Baffin ice domes around Hudson Bay separate, which could be associated with the '8,200-year' event, the most pronounced abrupt climate event of the past nine thousand years(7). For both modelled pulses, the saddle between the two ice domes becomes subject to surface melting because of a general surface lowering caused by climate warming. The melting then rapidly accelerates as the saddle between the two domes gets lower, producing nine metres of sea level rise over 500 years. This mechanism of an ice 'saddle collapse' probably explains MWP-1A and the 8,200-year event and sheds light on the consequences of these events on climate.","[Gregoire, Lauren J.; Payne, Antony J.; Valdes, Paul J.] Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol BS8 1SS, Avon, England","Gregoire, LJ (reprint author), Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Univ Rd, Bristol BS8 1SS, Avon, England.",lauren.gregoire@bristol.ac.uk,"payne, antony/A-8916-2008; Gregoire, Lauren/A-7005-2011; Valdes, Paul/C-4129-2013","payne, antony/0000-0001-8825-8425; Gregoire, Lauren/0000-0003-0258-7282; ",Marie Curie Research Training Network NICE [MRTN-CT-2006-036127]; NERC QUEST [NE/D001846/1]; ORMEN [NE/C509558/1],"This work was supported by the Marie Curie Research Training Network NICE (MRTN-CT-2006-036127) and the NERC QUEST (NE/D001846/1) and ORMEN (NE/C509558/1) projects.

Heterochrony-change in the timing or rate of developmental events-has been implicated in the evolution of major vertebrate lineages such as mammals(2), including humans(1). Birds are the most speciose land vertebrates, with more than 10,000 living species(3) representing a bewildering array of ecologies. Their anatomy is radically different from that of other vertebrates. The unique bird skull houses two highly specialized systems: the sophisticated visual and neuromuscular coordination system(4,5) allows flight coordination and exploitation of diverse visual landscapes, and the astonishing variations of the beak enable a wide range of avian lifestyles. Here we use a geometric morphometric approach integrating developmental, neontological and palaeontological data to show that the heterochronic process of paedomorphosis, by which descendants resemble the juveniles of their ancestors, is responsible for several major evolutionary transitions in the origin of birds. We analysed the variability of a series of landmarks on all known theropod dinosaur skull ontogenies as well as outgroups and birds. The first dimension of variability captured ontogeny, indicating a conserved ontogenetic trajectory. The second dimension accounted for phylogenetic change towards more bird-like dinosaurs. Basally branching eumaniraptorans and avialans clustered with embryos of other archosaurs, indicating paedomorphosis. Our results reveal at least four paedomorphic episodes in the history of birds combined with localized peramorphosis (development beyond the adult state of ancestors) in the beak. Paedomorphic enlargement of the eyes and associated brain regions parallels the enlargement of the nasal cavity and olfactory brain in mammals(6). This study can be a model for investigations of heterochrony in evolutionary transitions, illuminating the origin of adaptive features and inspiring studies of developmental mechanisms.","[Bhullar, Bhart-Anjan S.; Racimo, Fernando; Abzhanov, Arhat] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Marugan-Lobon, Jesus] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Biol, Unidad Paleontol, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Bever, Gabe S.] New York Inst Technol, New York Coll Osteopath Med, Dept Anat, Old Westbury, NY 11568 USA; [Rowe, Timothy B.] Univ Texas Austin, Jackson Sch Geosci, Dept Geol Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Norell, Mark A.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Paleontol, New York, NY 10024 USA","Bhullar, BAS (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, 16 Divin Ave, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",bhartanjan.bhullar@gmail.com; abzhanov@fas.harvard.edu,,"Racimo, Fernando/0000-0002-5025-2607",National Science Foundation [1110564];  [BFU2008-00642],"We thank R.

Nestedness in mutualistic ecological networks is the tendency for ecological specialists to interact with a subset of species that also interact with more generalist species(2). Recent mathematical and computational analysis has suggested that such nestedness increases species richness(3,4). By examining previous results and applying computational approaches to 59 empirical data sets representing mutualistic plant-pollinator networks, we show that this statement is incorrect. A simpler metric-the number of mutualistic partners a species has-is a much better predictor of individual species survival and hence, community persistence. Nestedness is, at best, a secondary covariate rather than a causative factor for biodiversity in mutualistic communities. Analysis of complex networks should be accompanied by analysis of simpler, underpinning mechanisms that drive multiple higher-order network properties.","[James, Alex; Plank, Michael J.] Univ Canterbury, Biomath Res Ctr, Christchurch 8040, New Zealand; [Pitchford, Jonathan W.] Univ York, York Ctr Complex Syst Anal, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Pitchford, Jonathan W.] Univ York, Dept Biol, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Pitchford, Jonathan W.] Univ York, Dept Math, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England","James, A (reprint author), Univ Canterbury, Biomath Res Ctr, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch 8040, New Zealand.",alex.james@canterbury.ac.nz,,"Plank, Michael/0000-0002-7539-3465",Royal Society of New Zealand [08-UOC-034]; University of Canterbury,"We thank D.

Here we show that a muscle protein core set, including a type II myosin heavy chain (MyHC) motor protein characteristic of striated muscles in vertebrates, was already present in unicellular organisms before the origin of multicellular animals. Furthermore, 'striated muscle' and 'non-muscle' myhc orthologues are expressed differentially in two sponges, compatible with a functional diversification before the origin of true muscles and the subsequent use of striated muscle MyHC in fast-contracting smooth and striated muscle. Cnidarians and ctenophores possess striated muscle myhc orthologues but lack crucial components of bilaterian striated muscles, such as genes that code for titin and the troponin complex, suggesting the convergent evolution of striated muscles. Consistently, jellyfish orthologues of a shared set of bilaterian Z-disc proteins are not associated with striated muscles, but are instead expressed elsewhere or ubiquitously. The independent evolution of eumetazoan striated muscles through the addition of new proteins to a pre-existing, ancestral contractile apparatus may serve as a model for the evolution of complex animal cell types.","[Steinmetz, Patrick R.

However, the role of the 'phylogenetically older' indirect pathways from the motor cortex to motor neurons, mediated by spinal interneurons, remains elusive. Here we used a novel double-infection technique to interrupt the transmission through the propriospinal neurons (PNs)(4-6), which act as a relay of the indirect pathway in macaque monkeys (Macaca fuscata and Macaca mulatta). The PNs were double infected by injection of a highly efficient retrograde gene-transfer vector into their target area and subsequent injection of adeno-associated viral vector at the location of cell somata. This method enabled reversible expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged tetanus neurotoxin, thereby permitting the selective and temporal blockade of the motor cortex-PN-motor neuron pathway. This treatment impaired reach and grasp movements, revealing a critical role for the PN-mediated pathway in the control of hand dexterity. Anti-GFP immunohistochemistry visualized the cell bodies and axonal trajectories of the blocked PNs, which confirmed their anatomical connection to motor neurons. This pathway-selective and reversible technique for blocking neural transmission does not depend on cell-specific promoters or transgenic techniques, and is a new and powerful tool for functional dissection in system-level neuroscience studies.","[Kinoshita, Masaharu; Isa, Kaoru; Nishimura, Yukio; Isa, Tadashi] Natl Inst Physiol Sci, Dept Dev Physiol, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan; [Matsui, Ryosuke; Hasegawa, Taku; Kasahara, Hironori; Watanabe, Dai] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Biostudies, Dept Mol & Syst Biol, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Kato, Shigeki; Kobayashi, Kazuto] Fukushima Med Univ Sch Med, Inst Biomed Sci, Dept Mol Genet, Fukushima 9601295, Japan; [Watakabe, Akiya; Yamamori, Tetsuo] Natl Inst Basic Biol, Div Brain Biol, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan; [Watakabe, Akiya; Yamamori, Tetsuo; Nishimura, Yukio; Isa, Tadashi] Grad Univ Adv Studies Sokendai, Kanagawa 2400193, Japan; [Nishimura, Yukio] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy JST, Precursory Res Embryon Sci & Technol PRESTO, Tokyo 1020076, Japan; [Alstermark, Bror] Umea Univ, Physiol Sect, Dept Integrat Med Biol, S-90187 Umea, Sweden","Isa, T (reprint author), Natl Inst Physiol Sci, Dept Dev Physiol, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan.",tisa@nips.ac.jp,"Yamamori, Tetsuo/N-6536-2015","Yamamori, Tetsuo/0000-0001-5016-0078","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan; Swedish Research Council","We thank S.

However, less is known about the role of mutations(2-4). Here we sequenced the exomes of 50 lethal, heavily pre-treated metastatic CRPCs obtained at rapid autopsy (including three different foci from the same patient) and 11 treatment-naive, high-grade localized prostate cancers. We identified low overall mutation rates even in heavily treated CRPCs (2.00 per megabase) and confirmed the monoclonal origin of lethal CRPC. Integrating exome copy number analysis identified disruptions of CHD1 that define a subtype of ETS gene family fusion-negative prostate cancer. Similarly, we demonstrate that ETS2, which is deleted in approximately one-third of CRPCs (commonly through TMPRSS2:ERG fusions), is also deregulated through mutation. Furthermore, we identified recurrent mutations in multiple chromatin- and histone-modifying genes, including MLL2 (mutated in 8.6% of prostate cancers), and demonstrate interaction of the MLL complex with the AR, which is required for AR-mediated signalling. We also identified novel recurrent mutations in the AR collaborating factor FOXA1, which is mutated in 5 of 147 (3.4%) prostate cancers (both untreated localized prostate cancer and CRPC), and showed that mutated FOXA1 represses androgen signalling and increases tumour growth. Proteins that physically interact with the AR, such as the ERG gene fusion product, FOXA1, MLL2, UTX (also known as KDM6A) and ASXL1 were found to be mutated in CRPC. In summary, we describe the mutational landscape of a heavily treated metastatic cancer, identify novel mechanisms of AR signalling deregulated in prostate cancer, and prioritize candidates for future study.","[Grasso, Catherine S.; Wu, Yi-Mi; Robinson, Dan R.; Cao, Xuhong; Dhanasekaran, Saravana M.; Khan, Amjad P.; Quist, Michael J.; Jing, Xiaojun; Lonigro, Robert J.; Brenner, J.

In the canonical situation, the tumour suppressor is completely inactivated through a two-hit process involving a point mutation in one allele and chromosomal deletion of the other(1). Here, to identify tumour suppressor genes in lymphoma, we screen a short hairpin RNA library targeting genes deleted in human lymphomas. We functionally identify those genes whose suppression promotes tumorigenesis in a mouse lymphoma model. Of the nine tumour suppressors we identified, eight correspond to genes occurring in three physically linked 'clusters', suggesting that the common occurrence of large chromosomal deletions in human tumours reflects selective pressure to attenuate multiple genes. Among the new tumour suppressors are adenosylmethionine decarboxylase 1 (AMD1) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A), two genes associated with hypusine, a unique amino acid produced as a product of polyamine metabolism through a highly conserved pathway(2). Through a secondary screen surveying the impact of all polyamine enzymes on tumorigenesis, we establish the polyamine-hypusine axis as a new tumour suppressor network regulating apoptosis. Unexpectedly, heterozygous deletions encompassing AMD1 and eIF5A often occur together in human lymphomas and co-suppression of both genes promotes lymphomagenesis in mice. Thus, some tumour suppressor functions can be disabled through a two-step process targeting different genes acting in the same pathway.","[Scuoppo, Claudio; Lowe, Scott W.] Watson Sch Biol Sci, Cold Spring Harbor Lab, New York, NY 11724 USA; [Miething, Cornelius; Reyes, Jose; Ruse, Cristian; Appelmann, Iris; Krasnitz, Alexander; Pappin, Darryl; Lowe, Scott W.] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; [Miething, Cornelius; Appelmann, Iris; Lowe, Scott W.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Program Canc Biol & Genet, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Lindqvist, Lisa; Pelletier, Jerry] McGill Univ, Dept Biochem, Montreal, PQ H3G 1Y6, Canada; [Yoon, Seungtai] Mt Sinai Sch Med, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Teruya-Feldstein, Julie] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Pelletier, Jerry] McGill Univ, Rosalind & Morris Goodman Canc Res Ctr, Montreal, PQ H3G 1Y6, Canada; [Lowe, Scott W.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10065 USA","Lowe, SW (reprint author), Watson Sch Biol Sci, Cold Spring Harbor Lab, New York, NY 11724 USA.",lowes@mskcc.org,"Ruse, Cristian/A-4609-2011; Miething, Cornelius/F-9498-2014","Ruse, Cristian/0000-0001-8237-6308; Miething, Cornelius/0000-0003-4699-3805; Pappin, Darryl/0000-0002-8981-8401",Don Monti Memorial Research Foundation; National Cancer Institute [CA087497]; National Institutes of Health/American Recovery and Reinvestment Act [CA148532]; Canadian Institutes of Health Research [MOP-106530]; Angel Foundation; Curt Engelhorn fellowship; American Association for Cancer Research-Astellas fellowship,"We thank J.

These subsets (T(H)1, T(H)2 and T(H)17 cells and regulatory T cells) secrete distinct cytokines and are involved in protection against different types of infection. Epigenetic mechanisms are involved in the regulation of these developmental programs, and correlations have been drawn between the levels of particular epigenetic marks and the activity or silencing of specifying genes during differentiation(1-3). Nevertheless, the functional relevance of the epigenetic pathways involved in T-H cell subset differentiation and commitment is still unclear. Here we explore the role of the SUV39H1-H3K9me3-HP1 alpha silencing pathway in the control of T(H)2 lineage stability. This pathway involves the histone methylase SUV39H1, which participates in the trimethylation of histone H3 on lysine 9 (H3K9me3), a modification that provides binding sites for heterochromatin protein 1 alpha (HP1 alpha)(4,5) and promotes transcriptional silencing. This pathway was initially associated with heterochromatin formation and maintenance(6) but can also contribute to the regulation of euchromatic genes(7-9). We now propose that the SUV39H1-H3K9me3-HP1 alpha pathway participates in maintaining the silencing of T(H)1 loci, ensuring T(H)2 lineage stability. In T(H)2 cells that are deficient in SUV39H1, the ratio between trimethylated and acetylated H3K9 is impaired, and the binding of HP1 alpha at the promoters of silenced T(H)1 genes is reduced. Despite showing normal differentiation, both SUV39H1-deficient T(H)2 cells and HP1 alpha-deficient T(H)2 cells, in contrast to wild-type cells, expressed T(H)1 genes when recultured under conditions that drive differentiation into T(H)1 cells. In a mouse model of T(H)2-driven allergic asthma, the chemical inhibition or loss of SUV39H1 skewed T-cell responses towards T(H)1 responses and decreased the lung pathology. These results establish a link between the SUV39H1-H3K9me3-HP1 alpha pathway and the stability of T(H)2 cells, and they identify potential targets for therapeutic intervention in T(H)2-cell-mediated inflammatory diseases.","[Allan, Rhys S.; Belz, Gabrielle T.] Walter & Eliza Hall Inst Med Res, Div Mol Immunol, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia; [Allan, Rhys S.; Zueva, Elina; Schreiber, Heidi A.; Masson, Vanessa; Amigorena, Sebastian] Inst Curie Res Ctr, INSERM, U932, F-75248 Paris 05, France; [Cammas, Florence] Inst Rech Canc Montpellier, CRLC Val dAurelle Paul Lamarque, F-34298 Montpellier 5, France; [Roche, Daniele; Maison, Christele; Quivy, Jean-Pierre; Almouzni, Genevieve] Inst Curie Res Ctr, CNRS, UMR218, F-75248 Paris 05, France","Allan, RS (reprint author), Walter & Eliza Hall Inst Med Res, Div Mol Immunol, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia.",rallan@wehi.edu.au; sebastian.amigorena@curie.fr,"Belz, Gabrielle/C-9350-2013","Belz, Gabrielle/0000-0002-9660-9587; Amigorena, Sebastian/0000-0001-8583-8416; quivy, jean-pierre/0000-0001-6557-7204","ANR [2010 1326 03, 2009 BLAN-0021 EPIGO, 2010 BLAN-1326 01]; European Commission Network of Excellence EpiGeneSys [HEALTH-F4-2010-257082]; Ligue National de Lutte contre le Cancer; Fellowship of the Institut Curie (Paris); Australian National Health and Medical Research Council-INSERM [461286];  [ANR-09-BLAN-0257]","We are grateful to the late R.

X-chromosome inactivation in eutherian mammals is mediated by the non-coding RNA Xist(2). Xist is not found in metatherians(3) (marsupials), and how X-chromosome inactivation is initiated in these mammals has been the subject of speculation for decades(4). Using the marsupial Monodelphis domestica, here we identify Rsx (RNA-on-the-silent X), an RNA that has properties consistent with a role in X-chromosome inactivation. Rsx is a large, repeat-rich RNA that is expressed only in females and is transcribed from, and coats, the inactive X chromosome. In female germ cells, in which both X chromosomes are active, Rsx is silenced, linking Rsx expression to X-chromosome inactivation and reactivation. Integration of an Rsx transgene on an autosome in mouse embryonic stem cells leads to gene silencing in cis. Our findings permit comparative studies of X-chromosome inactivation in mammals and pose questions about the mechanisms by which X-chromosome inactivation is achieved in eutherians.","[Grant, Jennifer; Mahadevaiah, Shantha K.; Sangrithi, Mahesh N.; Royo, Helene; Taylor, Willie; Elgar, Greg; Gilchrist, Mike J.; Turner, James M.

This view derives from what is known about primary visual cortex, where neural activity represents patterns of light. Yet it is unclear how well the analogy between motor and visual cortex holds. Single-neuron responses in motor cortex are complex, and there is marked disagreement regarding which movement parameters are represented. A better analogy might be with other motor systems, where a common principle is rhythmic neural activity. Here we find that motor cortex responses during reaching contain a brief but strong oscillatory component, something quite unexpected for a non-periodic behaviour. Oscillation amplitude and phase followed naturally from the preparatory state, suggesting a mechanistic role for preparatory neural activity. These results demonstrate an unexpected yet surprisingly simple structure in the population response. This underlying structure explains many of the confusing features of individual neural responses.","[Churchland, Mark M.] Columbia Univ, Med Ctr, David Mahoney Ctr, Dept Neurosci,Kavli Inst Brain Sci, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Churchland, Mark M.; Kaufman, Matthew T.; Foster, Justin D.; Ryu, Stephen I.; Shenoy, Krishna V.] Stanford Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Churchland, Mark M.; Kaufman, Matthew T.; Shenoy, Krishna V.] Stanford Univ, Neurosci Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Cunningham, John P.] Washington Univ St Louis, Dept Biomed Engn, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Cunningham, John P.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Cambridge CB2 1PZ, England; [Nuyujukian, Paul; Shenoy, Krishna V.] Stanford Univ, Dept Bioengn, Stanford, CA 94705 USA; [Nuyujukian, Paul] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Ryu, Stephen I.] Palo Alto Med Fdn, Dept Neurosurg, Palo Alto, CA 94301 USA; [Shenoy, Krishna V.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Churchland, MM (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Med Ctr, David Mahoney Ctr, Dept Neurosci,Kavli Inst Brain Sci, New York, NY 10032 USA.",mc3502@columbia.edu,"Kaufman, Matthew/B-6273-2014","Kaufman, Matthew/0000-0002-8072-023X",Helen Hay Whitney postdoctoral fellowship; National Institutes of Health (NIH); Burroughs Wellcome Fund Career Awards in the Biomedical Sciences; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/H019472/1]; McDonnell Center; National Science Foundation; Texas Instruments Stanford Graduate Fellowship; Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowship; Stanford Medical Scientist Training Program; NIH [1DP1OD006409]; NIH NINDS EUREKA [R01-NS066311]; NIH NINDS BRP [R01-NS064318]; NIH NINDS CRCNS [R01-NS054283]; DARPA-DSO REPAIR [N66001-10-C-2010]; Stanford Center for Integrated Systems; NSF Center for Neuromorphic Systems Engineering at Caltech; Office of Naval Research; Whitaker Foundation; McKnight Foundation; Sloan Foundation; Weston Havens Foundation,"We are deeply grateful to K.

We show that nearly all ES cells cycle in and out of this privileged state, which is partially controlled by histone-modifying enzymes.

The mechanism by which this interaction triggers intracellular phosphorylation of the TCR, which lacks a kinase domain, remains poorly understood. Here, we have introduced the TCR and associated signalling molecules into a non-immune cell and reconstituted ligand-specific signalling when these cells are conjugated with antigen-presenting cells. We show that signalling requires the differential segregation of a phosphatase and kinase in the plasma membrane. An artificial, chemically controlled receptor system generates the same effect as TCR-pMHC, demonstrating that the binding energy of an extracellular protein-protein interaction can drive the spatial segregation of membrane proteins without a transmembrane conformational change. This general mechanism may extend to other receptors that rely on extrinsic kinases, including, as we demonstrate, chimaeric antigen receptors being developed for cancer immunotherapy.","[James, John R.; Vale, Ronald D.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [James, John R.; Vale, Ronald D.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Cellular & Mol Pharmacol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA","Vale, RD (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, 600 16th St, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA.",vale@cmp.ucsf.edu,"James, John/B-5547-2008","James, John/0000-0003-1452-7578",Howard Hughes Medical Institute,,,38,105,105,4,44,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-Jul,2012,487,7405,,,,,64,69,,10.1038/nature11220,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,968LM,WOS:000305982900050,22763440.0,No,,,11/20/17,ronald d.,vale,na,na,na,na,na

A large velocity difference reduces the abundance of haloes(1,5,6) and requires the first stars to form in haloes of about a million solar masses(7,8), substantially greater than previously expected(9,10). Here we report a simulation of the distribution of the first stars at redshift 20 (cosmic age of around 180 million years), incorporating all these ingredients within a 400-megaparsec box. We find that the 21-centimetre hydrogen signature of these stars is an enhanced (ten millikelvin) fluctuation signal on the hundred-megaparsec scale, characterized(2) by a flat power spectrum with prominent baryon acoustic oscillations. The required sensitivity to see this signal is achievable with an integration time of a thousand hours with an instrument like the Murchison Wide-field Array(11) or the Low Frequency Array(12) but designed to operate in the range of 50-100 megahertz.","[Visbal, Eli] Harvard Univ, Jefferson Lab Phys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Visbal, Eli] Harvard Univ, Inst Theory & Computat, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Barkana, Rennan; Fialkov, Anastasia] Tel Aviv Univ, Raymond & Beverly Sackler Sch Phys & Astron, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Tseliakhovich, Dmitriy; Hirata, Christopher M.] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Visbal, E (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Jefferson Lab Phys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",evisbal@fas.harvard.edu; barkana@wise.tau.ac.il,,,Israel Science Foundation; European Research Council; US Department of Energy; National Science Foundation; David & Lucile Packard Foundation,"This work was supported by the Israel Science Foundation (for R.

Here we report observations of a young, Sun-like star (TYC 8241 2652 1) where infrared flux from post-collisional ejecta has decreased drastically, by a factor of about 30, over a period of less than two years. The star seems to have gone from hosting substantial quantities of dusty ejecta, in a region analogous to where the rocky planets orbit in the Solar System, to retaining at most a meagre amount of cooler dust.

However, because photons do not possess charge, a way of controlling them efficiently by electrical means has so far proved elusive. A promising way to achieve electric control of light could be through plasmon polaritons-coupled excitations of photons and charge carriers-in graphene(1-5). In this two-dimensional sheet of carbon atoms(6), it is expected that plasmon polaritons and their associated optical fields can readily be tuned electrically by varying the graphene carrier density. Although evidence of optical graphene plasmon resonances has recently been obtained spectroscopically(7,8), no experiments so far have directly resolved propagating plasmons in real space. Here we launch and detect propagating optical plasmons in tapered graphene nanostructures using near-field scattering microscopy with infrared excitation light(9-11). We provide real-space images of plasmon fields, and find that the extracted plasmon wavelength is very short-more than 40 times smaller than the wavelength of illumination. We exploit this strong optical field confinement to turn a graphene nanostructure into a tunable resonant plasmonic cavity with extremely small mode volume. The cavity resonance is controlled in situ by gating the graphene, and in particular, complete switching on and off of the plasmon modes is demonstrated, thus paving the way towards graphene-based optical transistors. This successful alliance between nanoelectronics and nano-optics enables the development of active subwavelength-scale optics and a plethora of nano-optoelectronic devices and functionalities, such as tunable metamaterials(12), nanoscale optical processing, and strongly enhanced light-matter interactions for quantum devices(13) and biosensing applications.","[Thongrattanasiri, Sukosin; Javier Garcia de Abajo, F.] CSIC, Inst Quim Fis Rocasolano, E-28006 Madrid, Spain; [Chen, Jianing; Alonso-Gonzalez, Pablo; Huth, Florian; Hillenbrand, Rainer] CIC nanoGUNE Consolider, Donostia San Sebastian 20018, Spain; [Chen, Jianing] Ctr Fis Mat CSIC UPV EHU, Donostia San Sebastian 20018, Spain; [Chen, Jianing] DIPC, Donostia San Sebastian 20018, Spain; [Badioli, Michela; Osmond, Johann; Spasenovic, Marko; Koppens, Frank H.

Rapid progress in plasmonics has largely relied on advances in device nano-fabrication(5-7), whereas less attention has been paid to the tunable properties of plasmonic media. One such medium-graphene-is amenable to convenient tuning of its electronic and optical properties by varying the applied voltage(8-11). Here, using infrared nano-imaging, we show that common graphene/SiO2/Si back-gated structures support propagating surface plasmons. The wavelength of graphene plasmons is of the order of 200 nanometres at technologically relevant infrared frequencies, and they can propagate several times this distance. We have succeeded in altering both the amplitude and the wavelength of these plasmons by varying the gate voltage. Using plasmon interferometry, we investigated losses in graphene by exploring real-space profiles of plasmon standing waves formed between the tip of our nano-probe and the edges of the samples. Plasmon dissipation quantified through this analysis is linked to the exotic electrodynamics of graphene(10). Standard plasmonic figures of merit of our tunable graphene devices surpass those of common metal-based structures.","[Fei, Z.; Rodin, A. S.; Andreev, G. O.; McLeod, A. S.; Wagner, M.; Fogler, M.

Despite the vast amount of attention that synthetic chemists have given to this problem(1-8), success has generally been limited to just a few simple ketone types. A method for the selective allylation of functionally complex ketones would greatly increase the utility of ketone allylation methods in the chemical synthesis of important targets. Here we describe the operationally simple, direct, regioselective and enantioselective allylation of beta-diketones. The strong tendency of beta-diketones to act as nucleophilic species was overcome by using their enol form to provide the necessary Bronsted-acid activation. This reaction significantly expands the pool of enantiomerically enriched and functionally complex tertiary carbinols that may be easily accessed. It also overturns more than a century of received wisdom regarding the reactivity of beta-diketones.","[Chalifoux, Wesley A.; Reznik, Samuel K.; Leighton, James L.] Columbia Univ, Dept Chem, New York, NY 10027 USA","Leighton, JL (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Dept Chem, New York, NY 10027 USA.",leighton@chem.columbia.edu,,"Chalifoux, Wesley/0000-0002-6849-6829",National Institute of General Medical Sciences [GM58133]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,"This work was supported by a grant from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (GM58133).

Although much of the available cranial and postcranial material of Au. sediba has been described(3-6), its feeding ecology has not been investigated. Here we present results from the first extraction of plant phytoliths from dental calculus of an early hominin. We also consider stable carbon isotope and dental microwear texture data for Au. sediba in light of new palaeoenvironmental evidence. The two individuals examined consumed an almost exclusive C-3 diet that probably included harder foods, and both dicotyledons (for example, tree leaves, fruits, wood and bark) and monocotyledons (for example, grasses and sedges). Like Ardipithecus ramidus (approximately 4.4 Myr ago) and modern savanna chimpanzees, Au. sediba consumed C-3 foods in preference to widely available C-4 resources. The inferred consumption of C-3 monocotyledons, and wood or bark, increases the known variety of early hominin foods. The overall dietary pattern of these two individuals contrasts with available data for other hominins in the region and elsewhere.","[Henry, Amanda G.] Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Anthropol, Plant Foods & Hominin Dietary Ecol Res Grp, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Ungar, Peter S.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Anthropol, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Ungar, Peter S.; Sponheimer, Matt; de Ruiter, Darryl J.; Berger, Lee] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Geosci, Inst Human Evolut, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Passey, Benjamin H.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Sponheimer, Matt; Sandberg, Paul] Univ Colorado Boulder, Dept Anthropol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Rossouw, Lloyd] Natl Museum Bloemfontein, Dept Archaeol, ZA-9300 Bloemfontein, South Africa; [Rossouw, Lloyd] Univ Free State, Dept Plant Sci, ZA-9300 Bloemfontein, South Africa; [Rossouw, Lloyd] Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Bamford, Marion] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Geosci, BPI Palaeontol, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa; [de Ruiter, Darryl J.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Anthropol, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Henry, AG (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Anthropol, Plant Foods & Hominin Dietary Ecol Res Grp, Deutsch Pl 6, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.",amanda_henry@eva.mpg.de,"Sponheimer, Matt/A-6075-2013","Sponheimer, Matt/0000-0002-8743-1123; Berger, Lee/0000-0002-0367-7629; Henry, Amanda/0000-0002-2923-4199","US National Science Foundation (NSF); Smithsonian Institution; Institute for Human Evolution of the University of the Witwatersrand; Max Planck Society; US Department of State Fulbright Scholarship Program; Malapa Project; Leakey Foundation; University of Colorado; Palaeontological Scientific Trust, South Africa; South African Department of Science and Technology; Wenner-Gren Foundation; Ray A.

Hybrids are usually rare and unfit, but even infrequent hybridization can aid adaptation by transferring beneficial traits between species. Here we use genomic tools to investigate introgression in Heliconius, a rapidly radiating genus of neotropical butterflies widely used in studies of ecology, behaviour, mimicry and speciation(2-5). We sequenced the genome of Heliconius melpomene and compared it with other taxa to investigate chromosomal evolution in Lepidoptera and gene flow among multiple Heliconius species and races. Among 12,669 predicted genes, biologically important expansions of families of chemosensory and Hox genes are particularly noteworthy. Chromosomal organization has remained broadly conserved since the Cretaceous period, when butterflies split from the Bombyx (silkmoth) lineage. Using genomic resequencing, we show hybrid exchange of genes between three co-mimics, Heliconius melpomene, Heliconius timareta and Heliconius elevatus, especially at two genomic regions that control mimicry pattern. We infer that closely related Heliconius species exchange protective colour-pattern genes promiscuously, implying that hybridization has an important role in adaptive radiation.","[Dasmahapatra, Kanchon K.; Rosser, Neil; Mallet, James] UCL, Dept Genet Evolut & Environm, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Walters, James R.; Nadeau, Nicola J.; Martin, Simon H.; Salazar, Camilo; Baxter, Simon W.; Surridge, Alison; Jiggins, Chris D.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England; [Briscoe, Adriana D.; Lewis, James J.; Martin, Arnaud; Yuan, Furong; Reed, Robert D.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Davey, John W.; Blaxter, Mark L.] Univ Edinburgh, Inst Evolutionary Biol, Ashworth Labs, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland; [Whibley, Annabel; Jones, Robert T.; Joron, Mathieu] Museum Natl Hist Nat, CNRS UMR 7205, F-75005 Paris, France; [Zimin, Aleksey V.; Yorke, James A.] Univ Maryland, Inst Phys Sci & Technol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Hughes, Daniel S.

Although the circuit organization underlying compartmentalized activity has been studied in several systems(1-4), its cellular basis is still unknown. Here we characterize compartmentalized activity in Caenorhabditis elegans RIA interneurons, which have multiple reciprocal connections to head motor neurons and receive input from sensory pathways. We show that RIA spatially encodes head movement on a subcellular scale through axonal compartmentalization. This subcellular axonal activity is dependent on acetylcholine release from head motor neurons and is simultaneously present and additive with glutamate-dependent globally synchronized activity evoked by sensory inputs. Postsynaptically, the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor GAR-3 acts in RIA to compartmentalize axonal activity through the mobilization of intracellular calcium stores. The compartmentalized activity functions independently of the synchronized activity to modulate locomotory behaviour.","[Hendricks, Michael; Ha, Heonick; Maffey, Nicolas; Zhang, Yun] Harvard Univ, Ctr Brain Sci, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Zhang, Y (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Ctr Brain Sci, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",yzhang@oeb.harvard.edu,,"Hendricks, Michael/0000-0002-3408-3858",Esther A. and Joseph Klingenstein Fund; March of Dimes Foundation; Alfred P.

Here we show that consumption of a diet high in saturated (milk-derived) fat, but not polyunsaturated (safflower oil) fat, changes the conditions for microbial assemblage and promotes the expansion of a low-abundance, sulphite-reducing pathobiont, Bilophila wadsworthia(2). This was associated with a pro-inflammatory T helper type 1 (T(H)1) immune response and increased incidence of colitis in genetically susceptible Il10(-/-), but not wild-type mice. These effects are mediated by milk-derived-fat-promoted taurine conjugation of hepatic bile acids, which increases the availability of organic sulphur used by sulphite-reducing microorganisms like B. wadsworthia. When mice were fed a low-fat diet supplemented with taurocholic acid, but not with glycocholic acid, for example, a bloom of B. wadsworthia and development of colitis were observed in Il10(-/-) mice. Together these data show that dietary fats, by promoting changes in host bile acid composition, can markedly alter conditions for gut microbial assemblage, resulting in dysbiosis that can perturb immune homeostasis. The data provide a plausible mechanistic basis by which Western-type diets high in certain saturated fats might increase the prevalence of complex immune-mediated diseases like inflammatory bowel disease in genetically susceptible hosts.","[Devkota, Suzanne; Wang, Yunwei; Musch, Mark W.; Leone, Vanessa; Fehlner-Peach, Hannah; Nadimpalli, Anuradha; Jabri, Bana; Chang, Eugene B.] Univ Chicago, Dept Med, Knapp Ctr Biomed Discovery, Gastroenterol Sect, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Antonopoulos, Dionysios A.] Argonne Natl Lab, Inst Genom & Syst Biol, Argonne, IL 60439 USA","Chang, EB (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Dept Med, Knapp Ctr Biomed Discovery, Gastroenterol Sect, 900 E 57th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",echang@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu,,,"National Center for Research Resources; NIDDK of the National Institutes of Health; NIGMS of the National Institutes of Health; NCCAM of the National Institutes of Health [DK-42086, DK47722, UH3DK083993, F31AT006073]; Gastrointestinal Research Foundation; Crohns and Colitis Foundation of America; Peter and Carol Goldman Family Research Fund; Harry and Leona Helmsley Trust Foundation (SHARE)","This work was supported by the National Center for Research Resources and the NIDDK, NIGMS and NCCAM of the National Institutes of Health through grant number DK-42086 (E.

Although bacterial lung infection and the resulting inflammation cause most of the morbidity and mortality, how the loss of CFTR function first disrupts airway host defence has remained uncertain(2-6). To investigate the abnormalities that impair elimination when a bacterium lands on the pristine surface of a newborn CF airway, we interrogated the viability of individual bacteria immobilized on solid grids and placed onto the airway surface. As a model, we studied CF pigs, which spontaneously develop hallmark features of CF lung disease(7,8). At birth, their lungs lack infection and inflammation, but have a reduced ability to eradicate bacteria(8). Here we show that in newborn wild-type pigs, the thin layer of airway surface liquid (ASL) rapidly kills bacteria in vivo, when removed from the lung and in primary epithelial cultures. Lack of CFTR reduces bacterial killing. We found that the ASL pH was more acidic in CF pigs, and reducing pH inhibited the antimicrobial activity of ASL. Reducing ASL pH diminished bacterial killing in wild-type pigs, and, conversely, increasing ASL pH rescued killing in CF pigs. These results directly link the initial host defence defect to the loss of CFTR, an anion channel that facilitates HCO3- transport(9-13). Without CFTR, airway epithelial HCO3- secretion is defective, the ASL pH falls and inhibits antimicrobial function, and thereby impairs the killing of bacteria that enter the newborn lung. These findings suggest that increasing ASL pH might prevent the initial infection in patients with CF, and that assaying bacterial killing could report on the benefit of therapeutic interventions.","[Pezzulo, Alejandro A.; Tang, Xiao Xiao; Hoegger, Mark J.; Abou Alaiwa, Mahmoud H.; Karp, Phillip H.; Banfi, Botond; Stoltz, David A.; Welsh, Michael J.; Zabner, Joseph] Univ Iowa, Dept Med, Roy J & Lucille A Carver Coll Med, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Tang, Xiao Xiao; Karp, Phillip H.; Welsh, Michael J.] Univ Iowa, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Roy J & Lucille A Carver Coll Med, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Ramachandran, Shyam; Wohlford-Lenane, Christine L.; McCray, Paul B., Jr.] Univ Iowa, Dept Pediat, Roy J & Lucille A Carver Coll Med, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Moninger, Thomas O.] Univ Iowa, Cent Electron Microscopy Facil, Roy J & Lucille A Carver Coll Med, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Haagsman, Henk P.; van Eijk, Martin] Univ Utrecht, Fac Vet Med, Dept Infect Dis & Immunol, NL-3584 CL Utrecht, Netherlands; [Horswill, Alexander R.] Univ Iowa, Dept Microbiol, Roy J & Lucille A Carver Coll Med, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Welsh, Michael J.] Univ Iowa, Dept Mol Physiol & Biophys, Roy J & Lucille A Carver Coll Med, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA","Welsh, MJ (reprint author), Univ Iowa, Dept Med, Roy J & Lucille A Carver Coll Med, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",michael-welsh@uiowa.edu; joseph-zabner@uiowa.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health (NIH) [HL51670, HL091842, HL102288]; Cystic Fibrosis Foundation; Gilead Sciences Research Scholars Program in Cystic Fibrosis; Human Frontier Science Program [RGP001612009-C];  [AI076671]","We thank J.

SIRT7 is a mammalian sirtuin whose biochemical activity, molecular targets and physiological functions have been unclear. Here we show that SIRT7 is an NAD(+)-dependent H3K18Ac (acetylated lysine 18 of histone H3) deacetylase that stabilizes the transformed state of cancer cells. Genome-wide binding studies reveal that SIRT7 binds to promoters of a specific set of gene targets, where it deacetylates H3K18Ac and promotes transcriptional repression. The spectrum of SIRT7 target genes is defined in part by its interaction with the cancer-associated E26 transformed specific (ETS) transcription factor ELK4, and comprises numerous genes with links to tumour suppression. Notably, selective hypoacetylation of H3K18Ac has been linked to oncogenic transformation, and in patients is associated with aggressive tumour phenotypes and poor prognosis(3-6). We find that deacetylation of H3K18Ac by SIRT7 is necessary for maintaining essential features of human cancer cells, including anchorage-independent growth and escape from contact inhibition. Moreover, SIRT7 is necessary for a global hypoacetylation of H3K18Ac associated with cellular transformation by the viral oncoprotein E1A. Finally, SIRT7 depletion markedly reduces the tumorigenicity of human cancer cell xenografts in mice. Together, our work establishes SIRT7 as a highly selective H3K18Ac deacetylase and demonstrates a pivotal role for SIRT7 in chromatin regulation, cellular transformation programs and tumour formation in vivo.","[Barber, Matthew F.; Michishita-Kioi, Eriko; Tasselli, Luisa; Tennen, Ruth I.; Paredes, Silvana; Chua, Katrin F.] Stanford Univ, Dept Med, Div Endocrinol Gerontol & Metab, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Barber, Matthew F.; Gozani, Or] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Michishita-Kioi, Eriko; Tasselli, Luisa; Paredes, Silvana; Chua, Katrin F.] VA Palo Alto Hlth Care Syst, Geriatr Res Educ & Clin Ctr, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA; [Xi, Yuanxin; Chen, Kaifu; Li, Wei] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Dan L Duncan Canc Ctr, Div Biostat, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Kioi, Mitomu] Stanford Univ, Dept Radiat Oncol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Moqtaderi, Zarmik; Struhl, Kevin] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem & Mol Pharmacol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Tennen, Ruth I.; Chua, Katrin F.] Stanford Univ, Canc Biol Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Young, Nicolas L.; Garcia, Benjamin A.] Princeton Univ, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Chua, KF (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Med, Div Endocrinol Gerontol & Metab, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",WL1@bcm.edu; kfchua@stanford.edu,"; Tasselli, Luisa/L-8979-2016","Barber, Matthew/0000-0003-2008-2165; Tasselli, Luisa/0000-0003-3349-1371; Kioi, Mitomu/0000-0002-7981-3340; Young, Nicolas/0000-0002-3323-2815","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [K08 AG028961, R01 AG028867, U01DA025956, R01 GM079641, GM 30186, HG 4558, DP2OD007447, 1018438-142 PABCA, 3T32DK007217-36S1]; National Science Foundation [CBET-0941143]; Department of Defense [PC094421]; Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT) [RP110471-C3]; Department of Veterans Affairs; ARCS Scholarship; American Italian Cancer Foundation Post-doctoral Research Fellowship; Duncan Scholar Award; Mason Case Graduate Fellowship","We thank M.

The nanoscale repeat structure of the S-layer lattices and their self-assembly from S-layer proteins (SLPs) have sparked interest in their use as patterning and display scaffolds for a range of nano-biotechnological applications(4-7). Despite their biological abundance and the technological interest in them, structural information about SLPs is limited to truncated and assembly-negative proteins(8-10). Here we report the X-ray structure of the SbsB SLP of Geobacillus stearothermophilus PV72/p2 by the use of nanobody-aided crystallization. SbsB consists of a seven-domain protein, formed by an amino-terminal cell-wall attachment domain and six consecutive immunoglobulin-like domains, that organize into a phi-shaped disk-like monomeric crystallization unit stabilized by interdomain Ca2+ ion coordination. A Ca2+-dependent switch to the condensed SbsB quaternary structure pre-positions intermolecular contact zones and renders the protein competent for S-layer assembly. On the basis of crystal packing, chemical crosslinking data and cryo-electron microscopy projections, we present a model for the molecular organization of this SLP into a porous protein sheet inside the S-layer. The SbsB lattice represents a previously undescribed structural model for protein assemblies and may advance our understanding of SLP physiology and self-assembly, as well as the rational design of engineered higher-order structures for biotechnology(4-7).","[Baranova, Ekaterina; Van Gerven, Nani; Remaut, Han] VIB, VIB Dept Struct Biol, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Baranova, Ekaterina; Garcia-Pino, Abel; Van Gerven, Nani; Pardon, Els; Steyaert, Jan; Remaut, Han] Vrije Univ Brussel, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Fronzes, Remi] Inst Pasteur, Unite G5, F-75015 Paris, France; [Fronzes, Remi; Pehau-Arnaudet, Gerard] Inst Pasteur, CNRS, Unite Rech Mixte 3538, F-75015 Paris, France; [Papapostolou, David; Howorka, Stefan] UCL, Inst Struct & Mol Biol, Dept Chem, London WC1H 0AJ, England","Remaut, H (reprint author), VIB, VIB Dept Struct Biol, Pl Laan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",han.remaut@vib-vub.be,"Steyaert, Jan/H-4662-2011; FIP, BM30A/I-5166-2015","Steyaert, Jan/0000-0002-3825-874X; Garcia-Pino, Abel/0000-0002-0634-0300; Fronzes, Remi/0000-0003-3031-9824",VIB (Vlaams Institute voor Biotechnologie) [PRJ9]; Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek-Vlaanderen through an Odysseus grant; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut Pasteur; Interuniversity Attraction Poles grant [P6/19]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/E010466/1]; University College London;  [FWO551],"We thank staff at beamlines Proxima-1 and SWING (Soleil), beamline BM30A (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility) and beamline X33 (Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron) for technical assistance during data collection.

Here we show that these combinatorial circuits integrated a two-molecule input and performed digital computations with NOT, AND, NAND and N-IMPLY expression logic in single mammalian cells. Functional interconnection of two N-IMPLY variants resulted in bitwise intracellular XOR operations, and a combinatorial arrangement of three logic gates enabled independent cells to perform programmable half-subtractor and half-adder calculations. Individual mammalian cells capable of executing basic molecular arithmetic functions isolated or coordinated to metabolic activities in a predictable, precise and robust manner may provide new treatment strategies and bio-electronic interfaces in future gene-based and cell-based therapies.","[Auslaender, Simon; Auslaender, David; Mueller, Marius; Wieland, Markus; Fussenegger, Martin] ETH, Dept Biosyst Sci & Engn, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland; [Fussenegger, Martin] Univ Basel, Fac Sci, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland","Fussenegger, M (reprint author), ETH, Dept Biosyst Sci & Engn, Mattenstr 26, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland.",fussenegger@bsse.ethz.ch,,,Swiss National Science Foundation [31003A-126022]; EC Framework 7 (Persist),"We thank R.

Knowledge of how trophic interaction strengths are affected by differences among habitats is crucial for understanding variation in ecological systems. Here we show how substantial variation in consumption-rate data, and hence trophic interaction strengths, arises because consumers tend to encounter resources more frequently in three dimensions (3D) (for example, arboreal and pelagic zones) than two dimensions (2D) (for example, terrestrial and benthic zones). By combining new theory with extensive data (376 species, with body masses ranging from 5.24 x 10(-14) kg to 800 kg), we find that consumption rates scale sublinearly with consumer body mass (exponent of approximately 0.85) for 2D interactions, but superlinearly (exponent of approximately 1.06) for 3D interactions. These results contradict the currently widespread assumption of a single exponent (of approximately 0.75) in consumer-resource and food-web research. Further analysis of 2,929 consumer-resource interactions shows that dimensionality of consumer search space is probably a major driver of species coexistence, and the stability and abundance of populations.","[Pawar, Samraat; Dell, Anthony I.; Savage, Van M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Biomath, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Dell, Anthony I.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Savage, Van M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Savage, Van M.] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA","Pawar, S (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Biomath, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",samraat@ucla.edu,,"Pawar, Samraat/0000-0001-8375-5684","University of California, Los Angeles; US National Science Foundation Division of Environmental Biology [1021010]","We thank the authors who contributed data (Supplementary Tables 5-8), and P.

Here we find that Paneth cells, a key constituent of the mammalian intestinal stem-cell (ISC) niche, augment stem-cell function in response to calorie restriction. Calorie restriction acts by reducing mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signalling in Paneth cells, and the ISC-enhancing effects of calorie restriction can be mimicked by rapamycin. Calorie intake regulates mTORC1 in Paneth cells, but not ISCs, and forced activation of mTORC1 in Paneth cells during calorie restriction abolishes the ISC-augmenting effects of the niche. Finally, increased expression of bone stromal antigen 1 (Bst1) in Paneth cells-an ectoenzyme that produces the paracrine factor cyclic ADP ribose-mediates the effects of calorie restriction and rapamycin on ISC function. Our findings establish that mTORC1 non-cell-autonomously regulates stem-cell self-renewal, and highlight a significant role of the mammalian intestinal niche in coupling stem-cell function to organismal physiology.","[Yilmaz, Oemer H.; Katajisto, Pekka; Lamming, Dudley W.; Gueltekin, Yetis; Bauer-Rowe, Khristian E.; Sengupta, Shomit; Birsoy, Kivanc; Yilmaz, V.

It is one of the brightest exoplanets and one of the nearest to us, with an orbital period of just a few days. Over the course of more than a decade, measurements of its orbital inclination have been announced(2) and refuted(3), and have hitherto remained elusive(4-8). Here we report the detection of carbon monoxide absorption in the thermal dayside spectrum of tau Bootis b. At a spectral resolution of similar to 100,000, we trace the change in the radial velocity of the planet over a large range in phase, determining an orbital inclination of 44.5 degrees +/- 1.5 degrees and a mass 5.95 +/- 0.28 times that of Jupiter, demonstrating that atmospheric characterization is possible for non-transiting planets. The strong absorption signal points to an atmosphere with a temperature that is decreasing towards higher altitudes, in contrast to the temperature inversion inferred for other highly irradiated planets(9,10). This supports the hypothesis that the absorbing compounds believed to cause such atmospheric inversions are destroyed in tau Bootis b by the ultraviolet emission from the active host star(11).","[Brogi, Matteo; Snellen, Ignas A.

Braiding and twisting of magnetic field structures, which is caused by the convective flows at the solar surface, was suggested as an efficient mechanism for atmospheric heating(7). Convectively driven vortex flows that harbour magnetic fields are observed(8-10) to be abundant in the photosphere (the visible surface of the Sun). Recently, corresponding swirling motions have been discovered(11) in the chromosphere, the atmospheric layer sandwiched between the photosphere and the corona. Here we report the imprints of these chromospheric swirls in the transition region and low corona, and identify them as observational signatures of rapidly rotating magnetic structures. These ubiquitous structures, which resemble super-tornadoes under solar conditions, reach from the convection zone into the upper solar atmosphere and provide an alternative mechanism for channelling energy from the lower into the upper solar atmosphere.","[Wedemeyer-Bohm, Sven; Scullion, Eamon; van der Voort, Luc Rouppe] Univ Oslo, Inst Theoret Astrophys, N-0315 Oslo, Norway; [Wedemeyer-Bohm, Sven] Univ Oslo, Ctr Math Applicat, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Steiner, Oskar] Kiepenheuer Inst Solar Phys, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Rodriguez, Jaime de la Cruz] Uppsala Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, SE-75120 Uppsala, Sweden; [Fedun, Viktor; Erdelyi, Robert] Univ Sheffield, Sch Math & Stat, Solar Phys & Space Plasma Res Ctr, Sheffield S3 7RH, S Yorkshire, England","Wedemeyer-Bohm, S (reprint author), Univ Oslo, Inst Theoret Astrophys, POB 1029 Blindern, N-0315 Oslo, Norway.",svenwe@astro.uio.no,"Fedun, Viktor/M-9244-2013; Wedemeyer, Sven/F-3957-2010","Wedemeyer, Sven/0000-0002-5006-7540; Scullion, Eamon/0000-0001-9590-6427; de la Cruz Rodriguez, Jaime/0000-0002-4640-5658","Research Council of Norway; Science and Technology Facilities, UK","We acknowledge discussions with R.

Every atomic nucleus, characterized by a specific number of protons and neutrons, occupies a spot on the chart of nuclides, which is bounded by 'drip lines' indicating the values of neutron and proton number at which nuclear binding ends. The placement of the neutron drip line for the heavier elements is based on theoretical predictions using extreme extrapolations, and so is uncertain. However, it is not known how uncertain it is or how many protons and neutrons can be bound in a nucleus. Here we estimate these limits of the nuclear 'landscape' and provide statistical and systematic uncertainties for our predictions. We use nuclear density functional theory, several Skyrme interactions and high-performance computing, and find that the number of bound nuclides with between 2 and 120 protons is around 7,000.

Electron microscopy requires collection of particles on a substrate(3); visible light scattering provides insufficient resolution(4); and X-ray synchrotron studies have been limited to ensembles of particles(5). Here we demonstrate an in situ method for imaging individual sub-micrometre particles to nanometre resolution in their native environment, using intense, coherent X-ray pulses from the Linac Coherent Light Source(6) free-electron laser. We introduced individual aerosol particles into the pulsed X-ray beam, which is sufficiently intense that diffraction from individual particles can be measured for morphological analysis. At the same time, ion fragments ejected from the beam were analysed using mass spectrometry, to determine the composition of single aerosol particles. Our results show the extent of internal dilation symmetry of individual soot particles subject to non-equilibrium aggregation, and the surprisingly large variability in their fractal dimensions. More broadly, our methods can be extended to resolve both static and dynamic morphology of general ensembles of disordered particles. Such general morphology has implications in topics such as solvent accessibilities in proteins(7), vibrational energy transfer by the hydrodynamic interaction of amino acids(8), and large-scale production of nanoscale structures by flame synthesis(9).","[Loh, N.

However, it is difficult to achieve selectivity when multiple inequivalent C-H bonds are present in the target molecule. The usual approach is to use sigma-chelating directing groups, which lead to ortho-selectivity through the formation of a conformationally rigid six- or seven-membered cyclic pre-transition state(1-14). Despite the broad utility of this approach, proximity-driven reactivity prevents the activation of remote C-H bonds. Here we report a class of easily removable nitrile-containing templates that direct the activation of distal meta-C-H bonds (more than ten bonds away) of a tethered arene. We attribute this new mode of C-H activation to a weak 'end-on' interaction(15) between the linear nitrile group and the metal centre. The 'end-on' coordination geometry relieves the strain of the cyclophane-like pre-transition state of the meta-C-H activation event. In addition, this template overrides the intrinsic electronic and steric biases as well as ortho-directing effects with two broadly useful classes of arene substrates (toluene derivatives and hydrocinnamic acids).","[Leow, Dasheng; Li, Gang; Mei, Tian-Sheng; Yu, Jin-Quan] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Chem, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Yu, JQ (reprint author), Scripps Res Inst, Dept Chem, 10550 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",yu200@scripps.edu,"Leow, Dasheng/A-9549-2012; Li, Gang/I-2960-2012; mei, tiansheng/H-5293-2011","Leow, Dasheng/0000-0001-9823-0258; Li, Gang/0000-0001-5229-554X; ","Scripps Research Institute; NIH (NIGMS) [1 R01 GM084019-03]; Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) in Singapore","We thank The Scripps Research Institute and the NIH (NIGMS, 1 R01 GM084019-03) for their financial support.

During this time, modifications of the limbs-particularly the specialization of joints and the structures that guide their motions-fundamentally changed the ways in which early tetrapods could move(1-4). Nonetheless, little is known about the functional consequences of limb anatomy in early tetrapods and how that anatomy influenced locomotion capabilities at this very critical stage in vertebrate evolution. Here we present a three-dimensional reconstruction of the iconic Devonian tetrapod Ichthyostega and a quantitative and comparative analysis of limb mobility in this early tetrapod. We show that Ichthyostega could not have employed typical tetrapod locomotory behaviours, such as lateral sequence walking. In particular, it lacked the necessary rotary motions in its limbs to push the body off the ground and move the limbs in an alternating sequence. Given that long-axis rotation was present in the fins of tetrapodomorph fishes(5-7), it seems that either early tetrapods evolved through an initial stage of restricted shoulder(8,9) and hip joint mobility or that Ichthyostega was unique in this respect. We conclude that early tetrapods with the skeletal morphology and limb mobility of Ichthyostega were unlikely to have made some of the recently described Middle Devonian trackways(10).","[Pierce, Stephanie E.; Hutchinson, John R.] Royal Vet Coll, Dept Vet Basic Sci & Struct & Motion Lab, Hatfield AL9 7TA, Herts, England; [Pierce, Stephanie E.; Clack, Jennifer A.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Univ Museum Zool, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England","Pierce, SE (reprint author), Royal Vet Coll, Dept Vet Basic Sci & Struct & Motion Lab, Hawkshead Lane, Hatfield AL9 7TA, Herts, England.",spierce@rvc.ac.uk,,"Hutchinson, John/0000-0002-6767-7038","National Science Foundation [IIS-9874781, IIS-0208675]; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/G005877/1, NE/G00711X/1]","We thank J.

Although they are similar in many respects, bonobos and chimpanzees differ strikingly in key social and sexual behaviours(1-4), and for some of these traits they show more similarity with humans than with each other. Here we report the sequencing and assembly of the bonobo genome to study its evolutionary relationship with the chimpanzee and human genomes. We find that more than three per cent of the human genome is more closely related to either the bonobo or the chimpanzee genome than these are to each other. These regions allow various aspects of the ancestry of the two ape species to be reconstructed. In addition, many of the regions that overlap genes may eventually help us understand the genetic basis of phenotypes that humans share with one of the two apes to the exclusion of the other.","[Pruefer, Kay; Siebauer, Michael; Good, Jeffrey M.; Fischer, Anne; Ptak, Susan E.; Lachmann, Michael; Andres, Aida M.; Kelso, Janet; Paeaebo, Svante] Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Anthropol, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Munch, Kasper; Hobolth, Asger; Dutheil, Julien; Mailund, Thomas; Schierup, Mikkel H.] Aarhus Univ, Bioinformat Res Ctr, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Hellmann, Ines] Univ Vienna, Max F Perutz Labs, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Akagi, Keiko; Symer, David E.] Ohio State Univ, Ctr Comprehens Canc, Human Canc Genet Program, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Akagi, Keiko; Symer, David E.] Ohio State Univ, Ctr Comprehens Canc, Dept Mol Virol Immunol & Med Genet, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Miller, Jason R.; Walenz, Brian; Sutton, Granger] J Craig Venter Inst, Rockville, MD 20850 USA; [Koren, Sergey] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Kodira, Chinnappa; Winer, Roger; Knight, James R.] 454 Life Sci, Branford, CT 06405 USA; [Mullikin, James C.] NHGRI, Genome Technol Branch, Natl Inst Hlth, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Meader, Stephen J.; Ponting, Chris P.] Univ Oxford, Dept Physiol Anat & Genet, MRC Funct Genom Unit, Oxford OX1 3QX, England; [Lunter, Gerton] Wellcome Trust Ctr Human Genet, Oxford OX3 7BN, England; [Higashino, Saneyuki] Tokyo Inst Technol, Grad Sch Biosci & Biotechnol, Kanagawa 2268503, Japan; [Karakoc, Emre; Alkan, Can; Sajjadian, Saba; Ventura, Mario; Marques-Bonet, Tomas; Eichler, Evan E.] Univ Washington, Dept Genome Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Karakoc, Emre; Alkan, Can; Sajjadian, Saba; Ventura, Mario; Marques-Bonet, Tomas; Eichler, Evan E.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Catacchio, Claudia Rita; Ventura, Mario] Univ Bari, Dipartimento Anat Patol & Genet, Sez Genet, I-70125 Bari, Italy; [Marques-Bonet, Tomas] UPF CSIC, Inst Biol Evolutiva, ICREA, Barcelona 08003, Catalonia, Spain; [Atencia, Rebeca] Jane Goodall Inst, Pointe Noire, Zaire; [Mugisha, Lawrence] CSWCT, Entebbe, Uganda; [Junhold, Joerg] Zoo Leipzig, D-04105 Leipzig, Germany; [Patterson, Nick] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Good, Jeffrey M.] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Fischer, Anne] Int Ctr Insect Physiol & Ecol, Nairobi 00100, Kenya; [Schierup, Mikkel H.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark","Prufer, K (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Anthropol, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.",pruefer@eva.mpg.de; paabo@eva.mpg.de,"; Ventura, Mario/E-6420-2011; Lunter, Gerton/H-4939-2016; Dutheil, Julien/K-5479-2016; Munch, Kasper/A-1434-2010; Alkan, Can/D-2982-2009; Symer, David/E-4173-2011; Andres, Aida/B-4088-2014; Marques-Bonet, Tomas/I-4618-2014; Schierup, Mikkel/F-1675-2010; Catacchio, Claudia/P-8898-2015","Hobolth, Asger/0000-0003-4056-1286; Lunter, Gerton/0000-0002-3798-2058; Miller, Jason/0000-0002-6912-2925; Ponting, Chris/0000-0003-0202-7816; Mugisha, Lawrence/0000-0003-4932-3356; Ventura, Mario/0000-0001-7762-8777; Dutheil, Julien/0000-0001-7753-4121; Mailund, Thomas/0000-0001-6206-9239; Munch, Kasper/0000-0003-2880-6252; Alkan, Can/0000-0002-5443-0706; Andres, Aida/0000-0002-8590-9672; Marques-Bonet, Tomas/0000-0002-5597-3075; Schierup, Mikkel/0000-0002-5028-1790; Catacchio, Claudia/0000-0002-2166-723X","ERC [233297, StG_20091118]; National Institutes of Health [2R01GM077117-04A1, HG002385]; Ramon y Cajal grant (MICINN-RYC); Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center; Ohio Supercomputer Center [PAS0425]; Ohio Cancer Research Associates [GRT00024299]; Wellcome Trust [090532/Z/09/Z]; US National Science Foundation [OISE-0754461]; Danish Council for Independent Research \ Natural Sciences [09-062535]; ICREA","The sequencing effort was made possible by the ERC (grant 233297, TWOPAN) and the Max Planck Society.

Cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody that binds the extracellular domain of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), is effective in a subset of KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancers(1). After an initial response, secondary resistance invariably ensues, thereby limiting the clinical benefit of this drug(2). The molecular bases of secondary resistance to cetuximab in colorectal cancer are poorly understood(3-8). Here we show that molecular alterations (in most instances point mutations) of KRAS are causally associated with the onset of acquired resistance to anti-EGFR treatment in colorectal cancers. Expression of mutant KRAS under the control of its endogenous gene promoter was sufficient to confer cetuximab resistance, but resistant cells remained sensitive to combinatorial inhibition of EGFR and mitogen-activated protein-kinase kinase (MEK). Analysis of metastases from patients who developed resistance to cetuximab or panitumumab showed the emergence of KRAS amplification in one sample and acquisition of secondary KRAS mutations in 60% (6 out of 10) of the cases. KRAS mutant alleles were detectable in the blood of cetuximab-treated patients as early as 10 months before radiographic documentation of disease progression. In summary, the results identify KRAS mutations as frequent drivers of acquired resistance to cetuximab in colorectal cancers, indicate that the emergence of KRAS mutant clones can be detected non-invasively months before radiographic progression and suggest early initiation of a MEK inhibitor as a rational strategy for delaying or reversing drug resistance.","[Yaeger, Rona; Cercek, Andrea; Solit, David] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Med, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Misale, Sandra; Hobor, Sebastijan; Scala, Elisa; Buscarino, Michela; Siravegna, Giulia; Zanon, Carlo; Di Nicolantonio, Federica; Bardelli, Alberto] Inst Canc Res & Treatment IRCC, Mol Genet Lab, I-10060 Turin, Italy; [Misale, Sandra; Scala, Elisa; Buscarino, Michela; Medico, Enzo; Bardelli, Alberto] Univ Torino, Sch Med, Dept Oncol Sci, I-10060 Turin, Italy; [Janakiraman, Manickam; Solit, David] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Human Oncol & Pathogenesis Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Liska, David; Chen, Chin-Tung; Weiser, Martin] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Surg, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Valtorta, Emanuele; Veronese, Silvio; Gambacorta, Marcello] Osped Niguarda Ca Granda, Dept Pathol, I-20162 Milan, Italy; [Schiavo, Roberta; Bencardino, Katia; Sartore-Bianchi, Andrea; Siena, Salvatore] Osped Niguarda Ca Granda, Falck Div Med Oncol, I-20162 Milan, Italy; [Gallicchio, Margherita; Boscaro, Valentina] Univ Turin, Dipartimento Sci & Tecnol Farmaco, I-10125 Turin, Italy; [Vakiani, Efsevia] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Medico, Enzo] Inst Canc Res & Treatment IRCC, Lab Funct Genom, I-10060 Turin, Italy; [Di Nicolantonio, Federica; Bardelli, Alberto] FIRC Inst Mol Oncol IFOM, I-20139 Milan, Italy","Solit, D (reprint author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Med, New York, NY 10065 USA.",solitd@mskcc.org; alberto.bardelli@ircc.it,"Di Nicolantonio, Federica/A-2503-2011","Di Nicolantonio, Federica/0000-0001-9618-2010; Misale, Sandra/0000-0002-6031-0137; VALTORTA, EMANUELE/0000-0002-5087-6233; Janakiraman, Manickam/0000-0003-4423-6237; Sartore Bianchi, Andrea/0000-0003-0780-0409; SIENA, SALVATORE/0000-0002-2681-2846; Veronese, Silvio Marco/0000-0002-5280-3740","European Union [259015 COLTHERES]; Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro (AIRC) [9970]; Regione Piemonte; Fondazione Piemontese per la Ricerca sul Cancro (FPRC) Intramural Grant, 5xmille 2008, ONLUS; AIRC MFAG [11349]; Oncologia Ca' Granda ONLUS (OCGO); Commonwealth Foundation for Cancer Research; Experimental Therapeutics Center of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center; Society of MSKCC; National Institutes of Health; Beene Foundation; Regione Lombardia; Ministerio Salute grant 'Gene Mutation Monitoring in mCRC'","We are particularly indebted to S.

The mechanisms underlying this acquired resistance to anti-EGFR antibodies are largely unknown. This situation is in marked contrast to that of small-molecule targeted agents, such as inhibitors of ABL, EGFR, BRAF and MEK, in which mutations in the genes encoding the protein targets render the tumours resistant to the effects of the drugs(3-6). The simplest hypothesis to account for the development of resistance to EGFR blockade is that rare cells with KRAS mutations preexist at low levels in tumours with ostensibly wild-type KRAS genes. Although this hypothesis would seem readily testable, there is no evidence in pre-clinical models to support it, nor is there data from patients. To test this hypothesis, we determined whether mutant KRAS DNA could be detected in the circulation of 28 patients receiving monotherapy with panitumumab, a therapeutic anti-EGFR antibody. We found that 9 out of 24 (38%) patients whose tumours were initially KRAS wild type developed detectable mutations in KRAS in their sera, three of which developed multiple different KRAS mutations. The appearance of these mutations was very consistent, generally occurring between 5 and 6 months following treatment. Mathematical modelling indicated that the mutations were present in expanded subclones before the initiation of panitumumab treatment. These results suggest that the emergence of KRAS mutations is a mediator of acquired resistance to EGFR blockade and that these mutations can be detected in a non-invasive manner. They explain why solid tumours develop resistance to targeted therapies in a highly reproducible fashion.","[Diaz, Luis A., Jr.; Wu, Jian; Kinde, Isaac; Kinzler, Kenneth W.; Vogelstein, Bert] Johns Hopkins Kimmel Canc Ctr, Ludwig Ctr Canc Genet & Therapeut, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA; [Diaz, Luis A., Jr.; Wu, Jian; Kinde, Isaac; Kinzler, Kenneth W.; Vogelstein, Bert] Johns Hopkins Kimmel Canc Ctr, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA; [Diaz, Luis A., Jr.] Swim Amer Lab Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA; [Williams, Richard T.; Oliner, Kelly S.] Amgen Inc, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320 USA; [Wu, Jian] Fourth Mil Med Univ, Cell Engn Res Ctr, State Key Lab Canc Biol, Xian 710032, Peoples R China; [Wu, Jian] Fourth Mil Med Univ, Dept Cell Biol, Xian 710032, Peoples R China; [Hecht, J.

ELEGANS; SMALL RNAS; LIN-28; EXPRESSION; MATURATION; SITES; BINDS; LIN28; DECAY,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) comprise a large family of small RNA molecules that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression in many biological pathways(1). Most miRNAs are derived from long primary transcripts that undergo processing by Drosha to produce similar to 65-nucleotide precursors that are then cleaved by Dicer, resulting in the mature 22-nucleotide forms(2,3). Serving as guides in Argonaute protein complexes, mature miRNAs use imperfect base pairing to recognize sequences in messenger RNA transcripts, leading to translational repression and destabilization of the target messenger RNAs4,5. Here we show that the miRNA complex also targets and regulates non-coding RNAs that serve as substrates for the miRNA-processing pathway. We found that the Argonaute protein in Caenorhabditis elegans, ALG-1, binds to a specific site at the 3' end of let-7 miRNA primary transcripts and promotes downstream processing events. This interaction is mediated by mature let-7 miRNA through a conserved complementary site in its own primary transcript, thus creating a positive-feedback loop. We further show that ALG-1 associates with let-7 primary transcripts in nuclear fractions. Argonaute also binds let-7 primary transcripts in human cells, demonstrating that the miRNA pathway targets non-coding RNAs in addition to protein-coding messenger RNAs across species. Moreover, our studies in C. elegans reveal a novel role for Argonaute in promoting biogenesis of a targeted transcript, expanding the functions of the miRNA pathway in gene regulation. This discovery of autoregulation of let-7 biogenesis establishes a new mechanism for controlling miRNA expression.","[Zisoulis, Dimitrios G.; Kai, Zoya S.; Chang, Roger K.; Pasquinelli, Amy E.] Univ Calif San Diego, Div Biol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Chang, Roger K.] Stockholm Univ, Dept Biol Educ, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden","Pasquinelli, AE (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Div Biol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",apasquinelli@ucsd.edu,,"Chang, Roger/0000-0001-8085-9285",Leukemia & Lymphoma Society [3611-11]; US National Institutes of Health (NIH) CMG; NIH/NCI [T32 CA009523]; Swedish Board of Study Support; NIH [GM071654]; Keck Foundation; Peter Gruber Foundation,"We thank J.

Here we track T cells using multi-photon microscopy to demonstrate that the chemokine CXCL10 enhances the ability of CD8(+) T cells to control the pathogen Toxoplasma gondii in the brains of chronically infected mice. This chemokine boosts T-cell function in two different ways: it maintains the effector T-cell population in the brain and speeds up the average migration speed without changing the nature of the walk statistics. Notably, these statistics are not Brownian; rather, CD8(+) T-cell motility in the brain is well described by a generalized Levy walk. According to our model, this unexpected feature enables T cells to find rare targets with more than an order of magnitude more efficiency than Brownian random walkers. Thus, CD8(+) T-cell behaviour is similar to Levy strategies reported in organisms ranging from mussels to marine predators and monkeys(4-10), and CXCL10 aids T cells in shortening the average time taken to find rare targets.","[Banigan, Edward J.; Liu, Andrea J.] Univ Penn, Sch Arts & Sci, Dept Phys & Astron, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Harris, Tajie H.; Christian, David A.; Konradt, Christoph; Wojno, Elia D.

One of the major links between these two disorders is chronic, low-grade inflammation(1). Prolonged nutrient excess promotes the accumulation and activation of leukocytes in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and ultimately other tissues, leading to metabolic abnormalities such as insulin resistance, type-2 diabetes and fatty-liver disease. Although invasion of VAT by pro-inflammatory macrophages is considered to be a key event driving adipose-tissue inflammation and insulin resistance, little is known about the roles of other immune system cell types in these processes. A unique population of VAT-resident regulatory T (T-reg) cells was recently implicated in control of the inflammatory state of adipose tissue and, thereby, insulin sensitivity(2). Here we identify peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma, the 'master regulator' of adipocyte differentiation, as a crucial molecular orchestrator of VAT T-reg cell accumulation, phenotype and function. Unexpectedly, PPAR-gamma expression by VAT T-reg cells was necessary for complete restoration of insulin sensitivity in obese mice by the thiazolidinedione drug pioglitazone. These findings suggest a previously unknown cellular mechanism for this important class of thiazolidinedione drugs, and provide proof-of-principle that discrete populations of T-reg cells with unique functions can be precisely targeted to therapeutic ends.","[Cipolletta, Daniela; Feuerer, Markus; Li, Amy; Benoist, Christophe; Mathis, Diane] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Div Immunol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Kamei, Nozomu; Lee, Jongsoon; Shoelson, Steven E.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Joslin Diabet Ctr, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Kamei, Nozomu; Lee, Jongsoon; Shoelson, Steven E.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Mathis, D (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Div Immunol, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",cbdm@hms.harvard.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health (NIH) [DK092541, DK51729]; Ellison Foundation (Boston); Dana Foundation; American Diabetes Association [RA 110BS97]; Joslin Diabetes Center [P30DK36836]; King Trust","We thank A.

HLA polymorphisms mostly map to the antigen-binding cleft, thereby diversifying the repertoire of self-derived and pathogen-derived peptide antigens selected by different HLA allotypes(2). A growing number of immunologically based drug reactions, including abacavir hypersensitivity syndrome (AHS) and carbamazepine-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), are associated with specific HLA alleles(3-7). However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms of these associations, including AHS, a prototypical HLA-associated drug reaction occurring exclusively in individuals with the common histocompatibility allele HLA-B*57:01, and with a relative risk of more than 1,000 (refs 6, 7). We show that unmodified abacavir binds non-covalently to HLA-B*57:01, lying across the bottom of the antigen-binding cleft and reaching into the F-pocket, where a carboxy-terminal tryptophan typically anchors peptides bound to HLA-B*57:01. Abacavir binds with exquisite specificity to HLA-B*57:01, changing the shape and chemistry of the antigen-binding cleft, thereby altering the repertoire of endogenous peptides that can bind HLA-B*57:01. In this way, abacavir guides the selection of new endogenous peptides, inducing a marked alteration in 'immunological self'. The resultant peptide-centric 'altered self' activates abacavir-specific T-cells, thereby driving polyclonal CD8 T-cell activation and a systemic reaction manifesting as AHS. We also show that carbamazepine, a widely used anti-epileptic drug associated with hypersensitivity reactions in HLA-B*15:02 individuals, binds to this allotype, producing alterations in the repertoire of presented self peptides. Our findings simultaneously highlight the importance of HLA polymorphism in the evolution of pharmacogenomics and provide a general mechanism for some of the growing number of HLA-linked hypersensitivities that involve small-molecule drugs.","[Illing, Patricia T.; Kostenko, Lyudmila; Chen, Zhenjun; Bharadwaj, Mandvi; Kjer-Nielsen, Lars; McCluskey, James] Univ Melbourne, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Illing, Patricia T.; Dudek, Nadine L.; Williamson, Nicholas A.; Purcell, Anthony W.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Illing, Patricia T.; Dudek, Nadine L.; Williamson, Nicholas A.; Purcell, Anthony W.] Univ Melbourne, Mol Sci & Biotechnol Inst Bio21, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Vivian, Julian P.; Gras, Stephanie; Rossjohn, Jamie] Monash Univ, Sch Biomed Sci, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Miles, John J.; Burrows, Scott R.] Queensland Inst Med Res, Brisbane, Qld 4029, Australia; [Miles, John J.; Burrows, Scott R.] Australian Ctr Vaccine Dev, Brisbane, Qld 4029, Australia; [Miles, John J.; Rossjohn, Jamie] Cardiff Univ, Sch Med, Inst Infect & Immun, Cardiff CF14 4XN, S Glam, Wales; [McCluskey, James] Australian Red Cross Blood Serv, Victorian Transplantat & Immunogenet Serv, W Melbourne, Vic 3003, Australia","McCluskey, J (reprint author), Univ Melbourne, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",apurcell@unimelb.edu.au; jamie.rossjohn@monash.edu; jamesm1@unimelb.edu.au,"Burrows, Scott/G-2050-2011; gras, stephanie/C-8307-2013; Rossjohn, Jamie/F-9032-2013; Bharadwaj, Mandvi/C-4446-2014; Williamson, Nicholas/O-9812-2016; McCluskey, James/A-1291-2007","Vivian, Julian/0000-0002-9400-4437; Rossjohn, Jamie/0000-0002-2020-7522; Williamson, Nicholas/0000-0002-2173-3452; McCluskey, James/0000-0002-8597-815X; Purcell, Anthony/0000-0003-0532-8331; Illing, Patricia/0000-0002-3870-0796",National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia (NHMRC); Australian Research Council (ARC); Monash University; NHMRC,"We thank R.

Divergent opinions exist about the importance of these studies of influenza transmission and about potential 'dual use' research implications. No consensus has developed yet about how to balance these concerns.

During beta(+)-decay, a proton transforms into a neutron in a previously not fully occupied orbital, emitting a positron-neutrino pair with either parallel or antiparallel spins, in a Gamow-Teller or Fermi transition, respectively. The transition probability, or strength, of a Gamow-Teller transition depends sensitively on the underlying shell structure and is usually distributed among many states in the neighbouring nucleus. Here we report measurements of the half-life and decay energy for the decay of Sn-100, the heaviest doubly magic nucleus with equal numbers of protons and neutrons. In the beta-decay of Sn-100, a large fraction of the strength is observable because of the large decay energy. We determine the largest Gamow-Teller strength so far measured in allowed nuclear beta-decay, establishing the 'superallowed' nature of this Gamow-Teller transition. The large strength and the low-energy states in the daughter nucleus, In-100, are well reproduced by modern, large-scale shell model calculations.","[Hinke, C.

We present an integrated analysis of copy number and gene expression in a discovery and validation set of 997 and 995 primary breast tumours, respectively, with long-term clinical follow-up. Inherited variants (copy number variants and single nucleotide polymorphisms) and acquired somatic copy number aberrations (CNAs) were associated with expression in similar to 40% of genes, with the landscape dominated by cis-and trans-acting CNAs. By delineating expression outlier genes driven in cis by CNAs, we identified putative cancer genes, including deletions in PPP2R2A, MTAP and MAP2K4. Unsupervised analysis of paired DNA-RNA profiles revealed novel subgroups with distinct clinical outcomes, which reproduced in the validation cohort. These include a high-risk, oestrogen-receptor-positive 11q13/14 cis-acting subgroup and a favourable prognosis subgroup devoid of CNAs. Trans-acting aberration hotspots were found to modulate subgroup-specific gene networks, including a TCR deletion-mediated adaptive immune response in the 'CNA-devoid' subgroup and a basal-specific chromosome 5 deletion-associated mitotic network. Our results provide a novel molecular stratification of the breast cancer population, derived from the impact of somatic CNAs on the transcriptome.","[Curtis, Christina; Chin, Suet-Feung; Rueda, Oscar M.; Lynch, Andy G.; Samarajiwa, Shamith; Yuan, Yinyin; Graef, Stefan; Markowetz, Florian; Tavare, Simon; Caldas, Carlos] Univ Cambridge, Dept Oncol, Cambridge CB2 2XZ, England; [Curtis, Christina; Chin, Suet-Feung; Rueda, Oscar M.; Dunning, Mark J.; Speed, Doug; Lynch, Andy G.; Samarajiwa, Shamith; Yuan, Yinyin; Graef, Stefan; Russell, Roslin; Markowetz, Florian; Brenton, James D.; Tavare, Simon; Caldas, Carlos] Canc Res UK, Cambridge Res Inst, Li Ka Shing Ctr, Cambridge CB2 0RE, England; [Shah, Sohrab P.; Turashvili, Gulisa; Ha, Gavin; Haffari, Gholamreza; Bashashati, Ali; McKinney, Steven; Watson, Peter; Aparicio, Samuel] Univ British Columbia, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Vancouver, BC V6T 2B5, Canada; [Shah, Sohrab P.; Turashvili, Gulisa; McKinney, Steven; Watson, Peter; Aparicio, Samuel] British Columbia Canc Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada; [Speed, Doug; Tavare, Simon] Univ Cambridge, Dept Appl Math & Theoret Phys, Ctr Math Sci, Cambridge CB3 0WA, England; [Langerod, Anita; Borresen-Dale, Anne-Lise] Radiumhosp, Dept Genet, Inst Canc Res, Oslo Univ Hosp, N-0310 Oslo, Norway; [Green, Andrew; Ellis, Ian] Univ Nottingham, Dept Histopathol, Sch Mol Med Sci, Nottingham NG5 1PB, England; [Provenzano, Elena; Wishart, Gordon; Caldas, Carlos] Cambridge Univ Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Cambridge Breast Unit, Addenbrookes Hosp, Cambridge CB2 2QQ, England; [Pinder, Sarah; Purushotham, Arnie] Kings Coll London, Breakthrough Breast Canc Res Unit, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Pinder, Sarah; Borresen-Dale, Anne-Lise] NIHR Cambridge Biomed Res Ctr, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Watson, Peter; Murphy, Leigh] Univ Manitoba, Manitoba Inst Cell Biol, Winnipeg, MB R3E 0V9, Canada; [Purushotham, Arnie] Guys & St Thomas NHS Fdn Trust, NIHR Comprehens Biomed Res Ctr, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Borresen-Dale, Anne-Lise] Univ Oslo, Inst Clin Med, Fac Med, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Brenton, James D.; Caldas, Carlos] Cambridge Expt Canc Med Ctr, Cambridge CB2 0RE, England; [Tavare, Simon] Univ So Calif, Mol & Computat Biol Program, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA","Caldas, C (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Oncol, Hills Rd, Cambridge CB2 2XZ, England.",carlos.caldas@cancer.org.uk; saparicio@bccrc.ca,"Maia, Ana-Teresa/F-4404-2012; Hadfield, James/A-1874-2013; Caldas, Carlos/A-7543-2008","Maia, Ana-Teresa/0000-0002-0454-9207; Hadfield, James/0000-0001-9868-4989; Ding, Zhihao/0000-0003-0961-2284; chin, suet-feung/0000-0001-5697-1082; Murphy, Leigh C/0000-0002-7676-6032; Curtis, Christina/0000-0003-0166-3802; /0000-0003-4167-8910; Brenton, James/0000-0002-5738-6683; Papatheodorou, Irene/0000-0001-7270-5470; Dunning, Mark/0000-0002-8853-9435; Samarajiwa, Shamith/0000-0003-1046-0601; Speed, Doug/0000-0002-0096-9765; Ha, Gavin/0000-0001-7578-7272; Lynch, Andy/0000-0002-7876-7338",Cancer Research UK; British Columbia Cancer Foundation; Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation BC/Yukon; University of Cambridge; Hutchinson Whampoa; NIHR Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre; Cambridge Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre; Centre for Translational Genomics (CTAG) Vancouver; BCCA Breast Cancer Outcomes Unit; Canada Research Chair; National Institutes of Health Centers of Excellence in Genomics Science [P50 HG02790],"The METABRIC project was funded by Cancer Research UK, the British Columbia Cancer Foundation and Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation BC/Yukon.

Eighteen significantly mutated genes were identified, including five genes (RUNX1, CBFB, MYH9, MLL3 and SF3B1) previously linked to haematopoietic disorders. Mutant MAP3K1 was associated with luminal A status, low-grade histology and low proliferation rates, whereas mutant TP53 was associated with the opposite pattern. Moreover, mutant GATA3 correlated with suppression of proliferation upon aromatase inhibitor treatment. Pathway analysis demonstrated that mutations in MAP2K4, a MAP3K1 substrate, produced similar perturbations as MAP3K1 loss. Distinct phenotypes in oestrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer are associated with specific patterns of somatic mutations that map into cellular pathways linked to tumour biology, but most recurrent mutations are relatively infrequent. Prospective clinical trials based on these findings will require comprehensive genome sequencing.","[Ellis, Matthew J.; Van Tine, Brian A.; Hoog, Jeremy; Lin, Li; Crowder, Robert; Snider, Jacqueline; Weber, Jason; DeSchryver, Katherine; Maher, Christopher A.; Ley, Timothy J.] Washington Univ, Dept Internal Med, Div Oncol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Ellis, Matthew J.; Margenthaler, Julie; McDonald, Sandra; Bose, Ron; Ley, Timothy J.; Wilson, Richard K.; Mardis, Elaine R.] Washington Univ, Siteman Canc Ctr, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Ellis, Matthew J.; Luo, Jingqin; Allred, D.

Drugs can act on several protein targets, some of which can be unrelated by conventional molecular metrics, and hundreds of proteins have been implicated in side effects. Here we use a computational strategy to predict the activity of 656 marketed drugs on 73 unintended 'side-effect' targets. Approximately half of the predictions were confirmed, either from proprietary databases unknown to the method or by new experimental assays. Affinities for these new off-targets ranged from 1nM to 30 mu M. To explore relevance, we developed an association metric to prioritize those new off-targets that explained side effects better than any known target of a given drug, creating a drug-target-adverse drug reaction network. Among these new associations was the prediction that the abdominal pain side effect of the synthetic oestrogen chlorotrianisene was mediated through its newly discovered inhibition of the enzyme cyclooxygenase-1. The clinical relevance of this inhibition was borne out in whole human blood platelet aggregation assays. This approach may have wide application to de-risking toxicological liabilities in drug discovery.","[Lounkine, Eugen; Whitebread, Steven; Mikhailov, Dmitri; Jenkins, Jeremy L.; Urban, Laszlo] Novartis Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Keiser, Michael J.] SeaChange Pharmaceut Inc, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Keiser, Michael J.; Doak, Allison K.; Shoichet, Brian K.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pharmaceut Chem, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Hamon, Jacques; Lavan, Paul; Weber, Eckhard; Cote, Serge] Novartis Inst Biomed Res, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland","Jenkins, JL (reprint author), Novartis Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",jeremy.jenkins@novartis.com; shoichet@cgl.ucsf.edu; laszlo.urban@novartis.com,"Keiser, Michael/F-2825-2016","Keiser, Michael/0000-0002-1240-2192; Jenkins, Jeremy/0000-0001-9795-0771","US National Institutes of Health [GM71896, AG002132, GM93456]; QB3 Rogers Family Foundation 'Bridging-the-Gap' Award","E.

Compared with prokaryotic Argonautes, KpAGO has numerous surface-exposed insertion segments, with a cluster of conserved insertions repositioning the N domain to enable full propagation of guide-target pairing. Compared with Argonautes in inactive conformations, KpAGO has a hydrogen-bond network that stabilizes an expanded and repositioned loop, which inserts an invariant glutamate into the catalytic pocket.

Metal-rich stars are much more likely to harbour gas giant planets(1-4), supporting the model that planets form by accumulation of dust and ice particles(5). Recent ground-based surveys suggest that this correlation is weakened for Neptunian-sized planets(4,6-9). However, how the relationship between size and metallicity extends into the regime of terrestrial-sized exoplanets is unknown. Here we report spectroscopic metallicities of the host stars of 226 small exoplanet candidates discovered by NASA's Kepler mission(10), including objects that are comparable in size to the terrestrial planets in the Solar System. We find that planets with radii less than four Earth radii form around host stars with a wide range of metallicities (but on average a metallicity close to that of the Sun), whereas large planets preferentially form around stars with higher metallicities. This observation suggests that terrestrial planets may be widespread in the disk of the Galaxy, with no special requirement of enhanced metallicity for their formation.","[Buchhave, Lars A.; Hansen, Terese] Univ Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Inst, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Buchhave, Lars A.; Bizzarro, Martin] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Star & Planet Format, Nat Hist Museum Denmark, DK-1350 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Latham, David W.; Torres, Guillermo; Esquerdo, Gilbert A.; Geary, John C.; Stefanik, Robert P.; Quinn, Samuel N.] Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Johansen, Anders] Lund Univ, Lund Observ, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Rowe, Jason F.] NASA, SETI Inst, Ames Res Ctr, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; [Batalha, Natalie M.] San Jose State Univ, San Jose, CA 95192 USA; [Brugamyer, Erik; Caldwell, Caroline; Cochran, William D.; Endl, Michael; Robertson, Paul] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Ciardi, David R.] CALTECH, NASA Exoplanet Sci Inst, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA; [Ford, Eric B.] Univ Florida, Bryant Space Sci Ctr 211, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Gilliland, Ronald L.] Space Telescope Sci Inst, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Isaacson, Howard; Marcy, Geoffrey W.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Laird, John B.] Bowling Green State Univ, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA; [Lucas, Philip W.] Univ Hertfordshire, Ctr Astrophys, Hatfield AL10 9AB, Herts, England; [Morse, Jon A.] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Phys Appl Phys & Astron, Troy, NY 12180 USA; [Shporer, Avi] Las Cumbres Observ, Global Telescope Network, Goleta, CA 93117 USA; [Shporer, Avi] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Phys, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Still, Martin] NASA, Bay Area Environm Res Inst, Ames Res Ctr, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA","Buchhave, LA (reprint author), Univ Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Inst, Blegdamsvej 17, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.",buchhave@astro.ku.dk,"Bizzarro, Martin/I-8701-2012","Bizzarro, Martin/0000-0001-9966-2124; Ciardi, David/0000-0002-5741-3047; Buchhave, Lars A./0000-0003-1605-5666; /0000-0001-6545-639X",NASA's Science Mission Directorate; Danish National Research Foundation; Carlsberg Foundation; European Research Council under ERC Starting Grant agreement [278675-PEBBLE2PLANET],The Kepler mission was competitively selected as the tenth NASA Discovery mission.

Its interior receives almost no direct sunlight and is a perennial cold trap(1,2), making Shackleton a promising candidate location in which to seek sequestered volatiles(3). However, previous orbital and Earth-based radar mapping(4-8) and orbital optical imaging(9) have yielded conflicting interpretations about the existence of volatiles. Here we present observations from the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter on board the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, revealing Shackleton to be an ancient, unusually well-preserved simple crater whose interior walls are fresher than its floor and rim. Shackleton floor deposits are nearly the same age as the rim, suggesting that little floor deposition has occurred since the crater formed more than three billion years ago. At a wavelength of 1,064 nanometres, the floor of Shackleton is brighter than the surrounding terrain and the interiors of nearby craters, but not as bright as the interior walls. The combined observations are explicable primarily by downslope movement of regolith on the walls exposing fresher underlying material. The relatively brighter crater floor is most simply explained by decreased space weathering due to shadowing, but a one-micrometre-thick layer containing about 20 per cent surficial ice is an alternative possibility.","[Zuber, Maria T.; Smith, David E.; Mazarico, Erwan] MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Head, James W.; Tye, Alexander R.; Fassett, Caleb I.] Brown Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Neumann, Gregory A.] NASA, Solar Syst Explorat Div, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Torrence, Mark H.] Stinger Ghaffarian Technol, Greenbelt, MD 20770 USA; [Aharonson, Oded; Rosenburg, Margaret A.] CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Melosh, H.

Whether nematicity plays an equally important role in these two systems is highly controversial. In iron pnictides, the nematicity has usually been associated with the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural transition at temperature T-s. Although recent experiments(3-7) have provided hints of nematicity, they were performed either in the low-temperature orthorhombic phase(3,5) or in the tetragonal phase under uniaxial strain(4,6,7), both of which break the 90 degrees rotational C-4 symmetry. Therefore, the question remains open whether the nematicity can exist above T-s without an external driving force. Here we report magnetic torque measurements of the isovalent-doping system BaFe2(As1-xPx)(2), showing that the nematicity develops well above T-s and, moreover, persists to the non-magnetic superconducting regime, resulting in a phase diagram similar to the pseudogap phase diagram of the copper oxides(8,12). By combining these results with synchrotron X-ray measurements, we identify two distinct temperatures-one at T*, signifying a true nematic transition, and the other at T-s (<T*), which we show not to be a true phase transition, but rather what we refer to as a 'meta-nematic transition', in analogy to the well-known meta-magnetic transition in the theory of magnetism.","[Kasahara, S.; Shi, H.

Because the size of the smallest resolvable pixel is proportional to aperture diameter and the maximum field of view is scale independent, the diffraction-limited pixel count is proportional to aperture area. At present, digital cameras operate near the fundamental limit of 1-10 megapixels for millimetre-scale apertures, but few approach the corresponding limits of 1-100 gigapixels for centimetre-scale apertures. Barriers to high-pixel-count imaging include scale-dependent geometric aberrations, the cost and complexity of gigapixel sensor arrays, and the computational and communications challenge of gigapixel image management. Here we describe the AWARE-2 camera, which uses a 16-mm entrance aperture to capture snapshot, one-gigapixel images at three frames per minute. AWARE-2 uses a parallel array of microcameras to reduce the problems of gigapixel imaging to those of megapixel imaging, which are more tractable. In cameras of conventional design, lens speed and field of view decrease as lens scale increases(1), but with the experimental system described here we confirm previous theoretical results(2-6) suggesting that lens speed and field of view can be scale independent in microcamera-based imagers resolving up to 50 gigapixels. Ubiquitous gigapixel cameras may transform the central challenge of photography from the question of where to point the camera to that of how to mine the data.","[Brady, D. J.; Marks, D.

The remarkable rock art found widely across the region depicts cattle herding among early Saharan pastoral groups, and includes rare scenes of milking; however, these images can rarely be reliably dated(4). Although the faunal evidence provides further confirmation of the importance of cattle and other domesticates(5), the scarcity of cattle bones makes it impossible to ascertain herd structures via kill-off patterns, thereby precluding interpretations of whether dairying was practiced. Because pottery production begins early in northern Africa(6) the potential exists to investigate diet and subsistence practices using molecular and isotopic analyses of absorbed food residues(7). This approach has been successful in determining the chronology of dairying beginning in the 'Fertile Crescent' of the Near East and its spread across Europe(8-11). Here we report the first unequivocal chemical evidence, based on the delta C-13 and Delta C-13 values of the major alkanoic acids of milk fat, for the adoption of dairying practices by prehistoric Saharan African people in the fifth millennium BC. Interpretations are supported by a new database of modern ruminant animal fats collected from Africa. These findings confirm the importance of 'lifetime products', such as milk, in early Saharan pastoralism, and provide an evolutionary context for the emergence of lactase persistence in Africa.","[Dunne, Julie; Evershed, Richard P.; Salque, Melanie; Cramp, Lucy] Univ Bristol, Sch Chem, Organ Geochem Unit, Bristol BS8 1TS, Avon, England; [Bruni, Silvia] Univ Milan, Dipartimento Chim Inorgan Metallorgan & Analit La, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Ryan, Kathleen] Univ Penn, African Sect, Museum Archaeol & Anthropol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Biagetti, Stefano; di Lernia, Savino] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Sci Antichita, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [di Lernia, Savino] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Geog Archaeology& Environm Sci, ZA-2050 Wits, South Africa","Evershed, RP (reprint author), Univ Bristol, Sch Chem, Organ Geochem Unit, Cantocks Close, Bristol BS8 1TS, Avon, England.",r.p.evershed@bristol.ac.uk; Savino.Dilernia@uniroma1.it,"biagetti, stefano/M-4875-2015; Bruni, Silvia/R-4100-2016","biagetti, stefano/0000-0003-0936-3070; Bruni, Silvia/0000-0002-5077-0391; Roffet-Salque, Melanie/0000-0001-9508-788X","UK Natural Environment Research Council; Sapienza, University of Rome (Grandi Scavi di Ateneo); Minister of Foreign Affairs (DGSP); USA National Science Foundation; Royal Society","We thank the UK Natural Environment Research Council for a PhD studentship to J.

Here we show in 104 TNBC cases that at the time of diagnosis these cancers exhibit a wide and continuous spectrum of genomic evolution, with some having only a handful of coding somatic aberrations in a few pathways, whereas others contain hundreds of coding somatic mutations. High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that only approximately 36% of mutations are expressed. Using deep re-sequencing measurements of allelic abundance for 2,414 somatic mutations, we determine for the first time-to our knowledge-in an epithelial tumour subtype, the relative abundance of clonal frequencies among cases representative of the population. We show that TNBCs vary widely in their clonal frequencies at the time of diagnosis, with the basal subtype of TNBC2,3 showing more variation than non-basal TNBC. Although p53 (also known as TP53), PIK3CA and PTEN somatic mutations seem to be clonally dominant compared to other genes, in some tumours their clonal frequencies are incompatible with founder status. Mutations in cytoskeletal, cell shape and motility proteins occurred at lower clonal frequencies, suggesting that they occurred later during tumour progression. Taken together, our results show that understanding the biology and therapeutic responses of patients with TNBC will require the determination of individual tumour clonal genotypes.","[Shah, Sohrab P.; Roth, Andrew; Oloumi, Arusha; Ha, Gavin; Turashvili, Gulisa; Ding, Jiarui; Haffari, Gholamreza; Bashashati, Ali; Prentice, Leah M.; Khattra, Jaswinder; Burleigh, Angela; Yap, Damian; McPherson, Andrew; Shumansky, Karey; Crisan, Anamaria; Giuliany, Ryan; Heravi-Moussavi, Alireza; Rosner, Jamie; Lai, Daniel; Watson, Peter; Huntsman, David; Aparicio, Samuel] Univ British Columbia, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Vancouver, BC V6T 2B5, Canada; [Shah, Sohrab P.; Roth, Andrew; Oloumi, Arusha; Ha, Gavin; Turashvili, Gulisa; Ding, Jiarui; Haffari, Gholamreza; Bashashati, Ali; Prentice, Leah M.; Khattra, Jaswinder; Burleigh, Angela; Yap, Damian; McPherson, Andrew; Shumansky, Karey; Crisan, Anamaria; Giuliany, Ryan; Heravi-Moussavi, Alireza; Rosner, Jamie; Lai, Daniel; Huntsman, David; Aparicio, Samuel] British Columbia Canc Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada; [Goya, Rodrigo; Zhao, Yongjun; Tse, Kane; Birol, Inanc; Varhol, Richard; Tam, Angela; Dhalla, Noreen; Zeng, Thomas; Ma, Kevin; Chan, Simon K.; Griffith, Malachi; Moradian, Annie; Cheng, S. -W.

A subset, known as driver mutations, confer clonal selective advantage on cancer cells and are causally implicated in oncogenesis(1), and the remainder are passenger mutations. The driver mutations and mutational processes operative in breast cancer have not yet been comprehensively explored. Here we examine the genomes of 100 tumours for somatic copy number changes and mutations in the coding exons of protein-coding genes. The number of somatic mutations varied markedly between individual tumours. We found strong correlations between mutation number, age at which cancer was diagnosed and cancer histological grade, and observed multiple mutational signatures, including one present in about ten per cent of tumours characterized by numerous mutations of cytosine at TpC dinucleotides. Driver mutations were identified in several new cancer genes including AKT2, ARID1B, CASP8, CDKN1B, MAP3K1, MAP3K13, NCOR1, SMARCD1 and TBX3. Among the 100 tumours, we found driver mutations in at least 40 cancer genes and 73 different combinations of mutated cancer genes. The results highlight the substantial genetic diversity underlying this common disease.","[Stephens, Philip J.; Tarpey, Patrick S.; Davies, Helen; Van Loo, Peter; Greenman, Chris; Wedge, David C.; Nik-Zainal, Serena; Martin, Sancha; Varela, Ignacio; Bignell, Graham R.; Yates, Lucy R.; Papaemmanuil, Elli; Beare, David; Butler, Adam; Cheverton, Angela; Gamble, John; Hinton, Jonathan; Jia, Mingming; Jayakumar, Alagu; Jones, David; Latimer, Calli; Lau, King Wai; McLaren, Stuart; McBride, David J.; Menzies, Andrew; Mudie, Laura; Raine, Keiran; Rad, Roland; Chapman, Michael Spencer; Teague, Jon; Campbell, Peter J.; Futreal, P.

This malignancy represents a heterogeneous group of tumours with characteristic molecular features, prognosis and responses to available therapy(2-4). Recurrent somatic alterations in breast cancer have been described, including mutations and copy number alterations, notably ERBB2 amplifications, the first successful therapy target defined by a genomic aberration(5). Previous DNA sequencing studies of breast cancer genomes have revealed additional candidate mutations and gene rearrangements(6-10). Here we report the whole-exome sequences of DNA from 103 human breast cancers of diverse subtypes from patients in Mexico and Vietnam compared to matched-normal DNA, together with whole-genome sequences of 22 breast cancer/normal pairs. Beyond confirming recurrent somatic mutations in PIK3CA(11), TP53(6), AKT1(12), GATA3(13) and MAP3K1(10), we discovered recurrent mutations in the CBFB transcription factor gene and deletions of its partner RUNX1. Furthermore, we have identified a recurrent MAGI3-AKT3 fusion enriched in triple-negative breast cancer lacking oestrogen and progesterone receptors and ERBB2 expression. The MAGI3-AKT3 fusion leads to constitutive activation of AKT kinase, which is abolished by treatment with an ATP-competitive AKT small-molecule inhibitor.","[Banerji, Shantanu; Cibulskis, Kristian; Carter, Scott L.; Frederick, Abbie M.; Lawrence, Michael S.; Sivachenko, Andrey Y.; Sougnez, Carrie; Zou, Lihua; Cortes, Maria L.; Ardlie, Kristin G.; Auclair, Daniel; Duke, Fujiko; Francis, Joshua; Jung, Joonil; Onofrio, Robert C.; Parkin, Melissa; Pho, Nam H.; Ramos, Alex H.; Schumacher, Steven E.; Stransky, Nicolas; Thompson, Kristin M.; Beroukhim, Rameen; Lander, Eric S.; Gabriel, Stacey B.; Garraway, Levi A.; Golub, Todd R.; Getz, Gad; Meyerson, Matthew] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Banerji, Shantanu; Peng, Shouyong; Schumacher, Steven E.; Beroukhim, Rameen; Polyak, Kornelia; Richardson, Andrea L.; Garraway, Levi A.; Meyerson, Matthew] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Banerji, Shantanu; Baselga, Jose; Beroukhim, Rameen; Polyak, Kornelia; Sgroi, Dennis C.; Richardson, Andrea L.; Lander, Eric S.; Garraway, Levi A.; Golub, Todd R.; Toker, Alex; Meyerson, Matthew] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Rangel-Escareno, Claudia; Fernandez-Lopez, Juan C.; Quintanar-Jurado, Valeria; Rebollar-Vega, Rosa; Romero-Cordoba, Sandra L.; Uribe-Figueroa, Laura; Jimenez-Sanchez, Gerardo; Melendez-Zajgla, Jorge; Hidalgo-Miranda, Alfredo] Inst Nacl Med Genom, Mexico City 01900, DF, Mexico; [Brown, Kristin K.; Toker, Alex] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Bautista-Pina, Veronica; Maffuz-Aziz, Antonio; Rodriguez-Cuevas, Sergio] FUCAM, Inst Enfermedades Mama, Mexico City 04980, DF, Mexico; [Baselga, Jose] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Div Hematol & Oncol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Beroukhim, Rameen; Meyerson, Matthew] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Biol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Polyak, Kornelia] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Sgroi, Dennis C.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Richardson, Andrea L.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Lander, Eric S.] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Golub, Todd R.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Pediat Oncol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Golub, Todd R.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chevy Chase, MD 20815 USA","Meyerson, M (reprint author), Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",atoker@bidmc.harvard.edu; gadgetz@broadinstitute.org; ahidalgo@inmegen.gob.mx; matthew_meyerson@dfci.harvard.edu,"Meyerson, Matthew/E-7123-2012; Fernandez, Juan Carlos/C-4976-2013; Hidalgo-Miranda, Alfredo/B-2123-2010; Romero-Cordoba, Sandra Lorena/A-2246-2014; Schumacher, Steven/E-9821-2013; Rangel-Escareno, Claudia/F-4587-2012","Fernandez, Juan Carlos/0000-0003-3680-4193; Hidalgo-Miranda, Alfredo/0000-0003-2315-3977; Romero-Cordoba, Sandra Lorena/0000-0002-5591-696X; Schumacher, Steven/0000-0002-6819-5647; Rangel-Escareno, Claudia/0000-0003-1303-0834; BROWN, KRISTIN/0000-0002-4991-8870",Carlos Slim Health Institute in Mexico; CancerCare Manitoba; University of Manitoba; John Gavin Post-doctoral Fellowship; Genesis Oncology Trust of New Zealand; Mexican Council of Science and Technology (CONACyT); NIH [CA122099]; Dana-Farber/Harvard SPORE in breast cancer under NCI grant [CA089393],"We would like to thank all patients who contributed samples to this study.

We previously demonstrated that astrocyte-secreted factors powerfully induce the formation of functional excitatory synapses between CNS neurons(1). Astrocyte-secreted thrombospondins induce the formation of structural synapses, but these synapses are postsynaptically silent(2). Here we use biochemical fractionation of astrocyte-conditioned medium to identify glypican 4 (Gpc4) and glypican 6 (Gpc6) as astrocyte-secreted signals sufficient to induce functional synapses between purified retinal ganglion cell neurons, and show that depletion of these molecules from astrocyte-conditioned medium significantly reduces its ability to induce postsynaptic activity. Application of Gpc4 to purified neurons is sufficient to increase the frequency and amplitude of glutamatergic synaptic events. This is achieved by increasing the surface level and clustering, but not overall cellular protein level, of the GluA1 subunit of the AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) glutamate receptor (AMPAR). Gpc4 and Gpc6 are expressed by astrocytes in vivo in the developing CNS, with Gpc4 expression enriched in the hippocampus and Gpc6 enriched in the cerebellum. Finally, we demonstrate that Gpc4-deficient mice have defective synapse formation, with decreased amplitude of excitatory synaptic currents in the developing hippocampus and reduced recruitment of AMPARs to synapses. These data identify glypicans as a family of novel astrocyte-derived molecules that are necessary and sufficient to promote glutamate receptor clustering and receptivity and to induce the formation of postsynaptically functioning CNS synapses.","[Allen, Nicola J.; Bennett, Mariko L.; Foo, Lynette C.; Chakraborty, Chandrani; Barres, Ben A.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Wang, Gordon X.; Smith, Stephen J.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Physiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Allen, NJ (reprint author), Salk Inst Biol Studies, Mol Neurobiol Lab, 10010 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",nallen@salk.edu,,,"NIDA [R01DA015043]; Human Frontiers Long Term Fellowship; NIH/NINDS [R01NS0725252, R01NS077601]","We thank R.

Notably, the balance between 5hmC and 5mC in the genome is linked with cell-differentiation processes such as pluripotency and lineage commitment(4-7). We have previously reported that the maternal factor PGC7 (also known as Dppa3, Stella) is required for the maintenance of DNA methylation in early embryogenesis, and protects 5mC from conversion to 5hmC in the maternal genome(8,9). Here we show that PGC7 protects 5mC from Tet3-mediated conversion to 5hmC by binding to maternal chromatin containing dimethylated histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2) in mice. In addition, imprinted loci that are marked with H3K9me2 in mature sperm are protected by PGC7 binding in early embryogenesis.

The viral haemagglutinin (HA) protein is a known host-range determinant as it mediates virus binding to host-specific cellular receptors(1-3). Here we assess the molecular changes in HA that would allow a virus possessing subtype H5 HA to be transmissible among mammals. We identified a reassortant H5 HA/H1N1 virus-comprising H5 HA (from an H5N1 virus) with four mutations and the remaining seven gene segments from a 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus-that was capable of droplet transmission in a ferret model. The transmissible H5 reassortant virus preferentially recognized human-type receptors, replicated efficiently in ferrets, caused lung lesions and weight loss, but was not highly pathogenic and did not cause mortality. These results indicate that H5 HA can convert to an HA that supports efficient viral transmission in mammals; however, we do not know whether the four mutations in the H5 HA identified here would render a wholly avian H5N1 virus transmissible. The genetic origin of the remaining seven viral gene segments may also critically contribute to transmissibility in mammals. Nevertheless, as H5N1 viruses continue to evolve and infect humans, receptor-binding variants of H5N1 viruses with pandemic potential, including avian-human reassortant viruses as tested here, may emerge. Our findings emphasize the need to prepare for potential pandemics caused by influenza viruses possessing H5 HA, and will help individuals conducting surveillance in regions with circulating H5N1 viruses to recognize key residues that predict the pandemic potential of isolates, which will inform the development, production and distribution of effective countermeasures.","[Imai, Masaki; Watanabe, Tokiko; Hatta, Masato; Das, Subash C.; Ozawa, Makoto; Zhong, Gongxun; Hanson, Anthony; Watanabe, Shinji; Li, Chengjun; Maher, Eileen A.; Neumann, Gabriele; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Pathobiol Sci, Madison, WI 53711 USA; [Watanabe, Tokiko; Watanabe, Shinji; Kawakami, Eiryo; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro] ERATO Infect Induced Host Responses Project, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; [Ozawa, Makoto; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro] Univ Tokyo, Dept Special Pathogens, Int Res Ctr Infect Dis, Inst Med Sci, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; [Shinya, Kyoko] Kobe Univ, Dept Microbiol & Infect Dis, Kobe, Hyogo 6500017, Japan; [Katsura, Hiroaki; Yamada, Shinya; Kiso, Maki; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro] Univ Tokyo, Div Virol, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Inst Med Sci, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; [Suzuki, Yasuo] Chubu Univ, Coll Life & Hlth Sci, Kasugai, Aichi 4878501, Japan","Kawaoka, Y (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Pathobiol Sci, Madison, WI 53711 USA.",kawaokay@svm.vetmed.wisc.edu,"Wei, Jianjian/F-7788-2011","Wei, Jianjian/0000-0001-8859-8462","Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation [48339, OPPGH5383]; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan; ERATO (Japan Science and Technology Agency); National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Public Health Service Research grants","The authors would like to acknowledge D.

These excitations are fundamental to the appearance of unconventional superconductivity and non-Fermi-liquid behaviour observed in actinide- and lanthanide-based compounds. Here we use spectroscopic mapping with the scanning tunnelling microscope to detect the emergence of heavy excitations with lowering of temperature in a prototypical family of cerium-based heavy-fermion compounds. Wedemonstrate the sensitivity of the tunnelling process to the compositenature of these heavy quasiparticles, which arises from quantum entanglement of itinerant conduction and f electrons. Scattering and interference of the composite quasiparticles is used to resolve their energy-momentum structure and to extract their mass enhancement, which develops with decreasing temperature. The lifetime of the emergent heavy quasiparticles reveals signatures of enhanced scattering and their spectral lineshape shows evidence of energy-temperature scaling. These findings demonstrate that proximity to a quantum critical point results in critical damping of the emergent heavy excitation of our Kondo lattice system.","[Aynajian, Pegor; da Silva Neto, Eduardo H.; Gyenis, Andras; Yazdani, Ali] Princeton Univ, Joseph Henry Labs, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Aynajian, Pegor; da Silva Neto, Eduardo H.; Gyenis, Andras; Yazdani, Ali] Princeton Univ, Dept Phys, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Baumbach, Ryan E.; Thompson, J.

Much of this diversity remains unexplained, although diet, environment, host genetics and early microbial exposure have all been implicated. Accordingly, to characterize the ecology of human-associated microbial communities, the Human Microbiome Project has analysed the largest cohort and set of distinct, clinically relevant body habitats so far. We found the diversity and abundance of each habitat's signature microbes to vary widely even among healthy subjects, with strong niche specialization both within and among individuals. The project encountered an estimated 81-99% of the genera, enzyme families and community configurations occupied by the healthy Western microbiome. Metagenomic carriage of metabolic pathways was stable among individuals despite variation in community structure, and ethnic/racial background proved to be one of the strongest associations of both pathways and microbes with clinical metadata. These results thus delineate the range of structural and functional configurations normal in the microbial communities of a healthy population, enabling future characterization of the epidemiology, ecology and translational applications of the human microbiome.","[Huttenhower, Curtis; Sathirapongsasuti, J.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded Human Microbiome Project Consortium has established a population-scale framework to develop metagenomic protocols, resulting in a broad range of quality-controlled resources and data including standardized methods for creating, processing and interpreting distinct types of high-throughput metagenomic data available to the scientific community. Here we present resources from a population of 242 healthy adults sampled at 15 or 18 body sites up to three times, which have generated 5,177 microbial taxonomic profiles from 16S ribosomal RNA genes and over 3.5 terabases of metagenomic sequence so far. In parallel, approximately 800 reference strains isolated from the human body have been sequenced. Collectively, these data represent the largest resource describing the abundance and variety of the human microbiome, while providing a framework for current and future studies.","[Methe, Barbara A.; Nelson, Karen E.; Madupu, Ramana; Bihan, Monika; Busam, Dana A.; Durkin, A.

To examine how gut microbiomes differ among human populations, here we characterize bacterial species in fecal samples from 531 individuals, plus the gene content of 110 of them. The cohort encompassed healthy children and adults from the Amazonas of Venezuela, rural Malawi and US metropolitan areas and included mono-and dizygotic twins. Shared features of the functional maturation of the gut microbiome were identified during the first three years of life in all three populations, including age-associated changes in the genes involved in vitamin biosynthesis and metabolism. Pronounced differences in bacterial assemblages and functional gene repertoires were noted between US residents and those in the other two countries. These distinctive features are evident in early infancy as well as adulthood. Our findings underscore the need to consider the microbiome when evaluating human development, nutritional needs, physiological variations and the impact of westernization.","[Yatsunenko, Tanya; Rey, Federico E.; Gordon, Jeffrey I.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Genome Sci & Syst Biol, St Louis, MO 63108 USA; [Manary, Mark J.; Trehan, Indi; Warner, Barbara] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Manary, Mark J.] Univ Malawi, Dept Community Hlth, Coll Med, Blantyre, Malawi; [Trehan, Indi] Univ Malawi, Dept Paediat & Child Hlth, Coll Med, Blantyre, Malawi; [Dominguez-Bello, Maria Gloria] Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Biol, Rio Piedras, PR 00931 USA; [Contreras, Monica] Venezuelan Inst Sci Res IVIC, Altos De Pipe, Venezuela; [Magris, Magda; Hidalgo, Glida] Amazon Ctr Res & Control Trop Dis CAICET, Amazonas, Venezuela; [Baldassano, Robert N.] Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Div Gastroenterol & Nutr, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Anokhin, Andrey P.; Heath, Andrew C.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Reeder, Jens; Kuczynski, Justin; Lozupone, Catherine A.; Lauber, Christian; Clemente, Jose Carlos; Knights, Dan; Knight, Rob] Univ Colorado, Dept Chem & Biochem, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Caporaso, J.

It is the only major plant hormone for which the receptor has not been firmly identified. Systemic acquired resistance in Arabidopsis requires the transcription cofactor nonexpresser of PR genes 1 (NPR1), the degradation of which acts as a molecular switch. Here we show that the NPR1 paralogues NPR3 and NPR4 are SA receptors that bind SA with different affinities. NPR3 and NPR4 function as adaptors of the Cullin 3 ubiquitin E3 ligase to mediate NPR1 degradation in an SA-regulated manner. Accordingly, the Arabidopsis npr3 npr4 double mutant accumulates higher levels of NPR1, and is insensitive to induction of systemic acquired resistance. Moreover, this mutant is defective in pathogen effector-triggered programmed cell death and immunity. Our study reveals the mechanism of SA perception in determining cell death and survival in response to pathogen challenge.","[Fu, Zheng Qing; Yan, Shunping; Saleh, Abdelaty; Wang, Wei; Mohan, Rajinikanth; Dong, Xinnian] Duke Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Gordon & Betty Moore Fdn, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Ruble, James; Zheng, Ning] Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Pharmacol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Oka, Nodoka] Kagawa Univ, Fac Agr, Miki, Kagawa 7610795, Japan; [Spoel, Steven H.] Univ Edinburgh, Inst Mol Plant Sci, Edinburgh EH9 3JR, Midlothian, Scotland; [Tada, Yasuomi] Kagawa Univ, Life Sci Res Ctr, Inst Res Promot, Miki, Kagawa 7610795, Japan","Dong, XN (reprint author), Duke Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Gordon & Betty Moore Fdn, Dept Biol, POB 90338, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",xdong@duke.edu,"; Yan, Shunping /D-7597-2011; Wang, Wei/F-7425-2013; Tada, Yasuomi/M-5041-2014; Wang, Wei/I-5230-2015","Spoel, Steven/0000-0003-4340-7591; Wang, Wei/0000-0002-3780-5158; Tada, Yasuomi/0000-0001-9900-069X","Hargitt Fellowship; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan [23120520]; Royal Society [Uf090321];  [GM069594-05];  [CA107134];  [T32GM008268-23]","We thank Y.

An early map of the Hubble Deep Field at a wavelength of 850 micrometres, which is sensitive to dust emission powered by star formation, revealed the brightest source in the field, dubbed HDF 850.1 (ref. 2). For more than a decade, and despite significant efforts, no counterpart was found at shorter wavelengths, and it was not possible to determine its redshift, size or mass(3-7). Here we report a redshift of z = 5.183 for HDF 850.1, from a millimetre-wave molecular line scan. This places HDF 850.1 in a galaxy overdensity at z approximate to 5.2, corresponding to a cosmic age of only 1.1 billion years after the Big Bang. This redshift is significantly higher than earlier estimates(3,4,6,8) and higher than those of most of the hundreds of submillimetre-bright galaxies identified so far. The source has a star-formation rate of 850 solar masses per year and is spatially resolved on scales of 5 kiloparsecs, with an implied dynamical mass of about 1.3 x 10(11) solar masses, a significant fraction of which is present in the form of molecular gas. Despite our accurate determination of redshift and position, a counterpart emitting starlight remains elusive.","[Walter, Fabian; Decarli, Roberto; Da Cunha, Elisabete; Hodge, Jacqueline; Rix, Hans-Walter] Max Planck Inst Astron, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Walter, Fabian; Carilli, Chris] Natl Radio Astron Observ, Pete V Domenici Array Sci Ctr, Socorro, NM 87801 USA; [Carilli, Chris; Lentati, Lindley; Maiolino, Roberto] Univ Cambridge, Cavendish Lab, Cambridge CB3 0HE, England; [Bertoldi, Frank] Univ Bonn, Argelander Inst Astron, D-53121 Bonn, Germany; [Cox, Pierre; Downes, Dennis; Neri, Roberto; Krips, Melanie] IRAM, F-38406 St Martin Dheres, France; [Da Cunha, Elisabete; Elbaz, David] Univ Paris Diderot, Lab AIM, CEA, DSM,CNRS,Irfu Serv Astrophys,CEA Saclay, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Dickinson, Mark] Natl Opt Astron Observ, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA; [Ellis, Richard; Riechers, Dominik A.] CALTECH, Dept Astron, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Weiss, Axel; Menten, Karl] Max Planck Inst Radioastron, D-53121 Bonn, Germany; [Bell, Eric] Univ Michigan, Dept Astron, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Dannerbauer, Helmut] Univ Vienna, Inst Astron, A-1080 Vienna, Austria; [Krumholz, Mark] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Astron & Astrophys, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Maiolino, Roberto] INAF Osservatorio Astron Roma, I-00040 Monte Porzio Catone, Italy; [Robertson, Brant; Stark, Dan P.] Univ Arizona, Dept Astron, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Spinrad, Hyron] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Astron, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Stern, Daniel] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA","Walter, F (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Astron, Konigstuhl 17, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany.",walter@mpia.de,"Daddi, Emanuele/D-1649-2012","Daddi, Emanuele/0000-0002-3331-9590",MPG (Germany); INSU/CNRS (France); IGN (Spain); NASA; DLR [FKZ 50OR1004],"This work is based on observations carried out with the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer.

Unlike Earth, most of the condensable methane (the equivalent of 5 m depth globally averaged(1)) lies in the atmosphere. Liquid detected on the surface (about 2 m deep) has been found by radar images only poleward of 50 degrees latitude(2,3), while dune fields pervade the tropics(4). General circulation models explain this dichotomy, predicting that methane efficiently migrates to the poles from these lower latitudes(5-7). Here we report an analysis of near-infrared spectral images(8) of the region between 20 degrees N and 20 degrees S latitude. The data reveal that the lowest fluxes in seven wavelength bands that probe Titan's surface occur in an oval region of about 60 x 40 km(2), which has been observed repeatedly since 2004. Radiative transfer analyses demonstrate that the resulting spectrum is consistent with a black surface, indicative of liquid methane on the surface. Enduring low-latitude lakes are best explained as supplied by subterranean sources (within the last 10,000 years), which may be responsible for Titan's methane, the continual photochemical depletion of which furnishes Titan's organic chemistry(9).","[Griffith, Caitlin A.; Lora, Juan M.; Turner, Jake; Brown, Robert H.; Tomasko, Martin G.; Doose, Lyn; See, Charles] Univ Arizona, Lunar & Planetary Lab, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Penteado, Paulo F.] Univ Sao Paulo, IAG, BR-05508090 Sao Paulo, Brazil","Griffith, CA (reprint author), Univ Arizona, Lunar & Planetary Lab, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",griffith@lpl.arizona.edu,"Penteado, Paulo/F-9081-2012","Penteado, Paulo/0000-0001-6759-2037; Lora, Juan/0000-0001-9925-1050",NASA,"Research by C.

The record of the past 3,000 years in the IntCal09 data set(10), which is a time series at 5-year intervals describing the C-14 content of trees over a period of approximately 10,000 years, shows three periods during which C-14 increased at a rate greater than 3 parts per thousand over 10 years. Two of these periods have been measured at high time resolution, but neither showed increases on a timescale of about 1 year (refs 11 and 12). Here we report C-14 measurements in annual rings of Japanese cedar trees from AD 750 to AD 820 (the remaining period), with 1- and 2-year resolution. We find a rapid increase of about 12 parts per thousand in the C-14 content from AD 774 to 775, which is about 20 times larger than the change attributed to ordinary solar modulation. When averaged over 10 years, the data are consistent with the decadal IntCal C-14 data from North American and European trees(13).

The main reasons are that mechanical tilting in an electron microscope with sub-angstrom precision over a very large angular range is difficult, that many real-life objects such as dielectric layers in microelectronic devices impose geometrical constraints and that many radiation-sensitive objects such as proteins limit the total electron dose. Hence, there is a need for a new tomographic scheme that is able to deduce three-dimensional information from only one or a few projections. Here we present an electron tomographic method that can be used to determine, from only one viewing direction and with sub-angstrom precision, both the position of individual atoms in the plane of observation and their vertical position. The concept is based on the fact that an experimentally reconstructed exit wave(3,4) consists of the superposition of the spherical waves that have been scattered by the individual atoms of the object. Furthermore, the phase of a Fourier component of a spherical wave increases with the distance of propagation at a known 'phase speed'. If we assume that an atom is a point-like object, the relationship between the phase and the phase speed of each Fourier component is linear, and the distance between the atom and the plane of observation can therefore be determined by linear fitting. This picture has similarities with Big Bang cosmology, in which the Universe expands from a point-like origin such that the distance of any galaxy from the origin is linearly proportional to the speed at which it moves away from the origin (Hubble expansion). The proof of concept of the method has been demonstrated experimentally for graphene with a two-layer structure and it will work optimally for similar layered materials, such as boron nitride and molybdenum disulphide.","[Van Dyck, Dirk] Univ Antwerp, B-2020 Antwerp, Belgium; [Chen, Fu-Rong] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan","Van Dyck, D (reprint author), Univ Antwerp, Groenenborgerlaan 171, B-2020 Antwerp, Belgium.",dirk.vandyck@ua.ac.be; frchen@ess.nthu.edu.tw,,,"Research foundation - Flanders (FWO) [G.0220.05, G.0188.08];  [NSC-100-2120-M-007-005];  [NSC-99-2120-M-007-008]","We acknowledge discussions with A.

Acanthodian internal anatomy is primarily understood from Acanthodes bronni(2,7-10) because it remains the only example preserved in substantial detail, central to which is an ostensibly osteichthyan braincase(1,2,7). For this reason, Acanthodes has become an indispensible component in early gnathostome phylogenies(1,11-17). Here we present a new description of the Acanthodes braincase, yielding new details of external and internal morphology, notably the regions surrounding and within the ear capsule and neurocranial roof. These data contribute to a new reconstruction that, unexpectedly, resembles early chondrichthyan crania. Principal coordinates analysis of a character-taxon matrix including these new data confirms this impression: Acanthodes is quantifiably closer to chondrichthyans than to osteichthyans. However, phylogenetic analysis places Acanthodes on the osteichthyan stem, as part of a well-resolved tree that also recovers acanthodians as stem chondrichthyans and stem gnathostomes. As such, perceived chondrichthyan features of the Acanthodes cranium represent shared primitive conditions for crown group gnathostomes. Moreover, this increasingly detailed picture of early gnathostome evolution highlights ongoing and profound anatomical reorganization of vertebrate crania after the origin of jaws but before the divergence of living clades.","[Coates, Michael I.] Univ Chicago, Dept Organismal Biol & Anat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Finarelli, John A.] Univ Coll Dublin, UCD Sch Biol & Environm Sci, UCD Sci Educ & Res Ctr, Dublin 4, Ireland","Coates, MI (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Dept Organismal Biol & Anat, 1025 E 57Th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",mcoates@uchicago.edu,,,Natural Environment Research Council (UK) [GT4/97/183ES]; National Science Foundation (USA) [DEB-0917922],"We thank R.

Cortical-basal ganglia circuits have an important yet unresolved function in this trial-and-error skill learning(1); influential 'actor-critic' models propose that basal ganglia circuits generate a variety of behaviours during training and learn to implement the successful behaviours in their repertoire(2,3). Here we show that the anterior forebrain pathway (AFP), a cortical-basal ganglia circuit(4), contributes to skill learning even when it does not contribute to such 'exploratory' variation in behavioural performance during training. Blocking the output of the AFP while training Bengalese finches to modify their songs prevented the gradual improvement that normally occurs in this complex skill during training. However, unblocking the output of the AFP after training caused an immediate transition from naive performance to excellent performance, indicating that the AFP covertly gained the ability to implement learned skill performance without contributing to skill practice. In contrast, inactivating the output nucleus of the AFP during training completely prevented learning, indicating that learning requires activity within the AFP during training. Our results suggest a revised model of skill learning: basal ganglia circuits can monitor the consequences of behavioural variation produced by other brain regions and then direct those brain regions to implement more successful behaviours. The ability of the AFP to identify successful performances generated by other brain regions indicates that basal ganglia circuits receive a detailed efference copy of premotor activity in those regions. The capacity of the AFP to implement successful performances that were initially produced by other brain regions indicates precise functional connections between basal ganglia circuits and the motor regions that directly control performance.","[Charlesworth, Jonathan D.; Warren, Timothy L.; Brainard, Michael S.] Univ Calif San Francisco, WM Keck Ctr Integrat Neurosci, Dept Physiol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Charlesworth, Jonathan D.; Warren, Timothy L.; Brainard, Michael S.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Neurosci Grad Program, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Charlesworth, JD (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, WM Keck Ctr Integrat Neurosci, Dept Physiol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",jcharles@phy.ucsf.edu,,,National Institutes of Health [NIDCD R01]; National Institute of Mental Health [P50]; National Science Foundation,"We thank L.

Mutations in synaptic proteins such as neuroligins(2,3), neurexins(4), GKAPs/SAPAPs(5) and ProSAPs/Shanks(6-10) were identified in patients with autism spectrum disorder, but the causative mechanisms remain largely unknown. ProSAPs/Shanks build large homo-and heteromeric protein complexes at excitatory synapses and organize the complex protein machinery of the postsynaptic density in a laminar fashion(11,12). Here we demonstrate that genetic deletion of ProSAP1/Shank2 results in an early, brain-region-specific upregulation of ionotropic glutamate receptors at the synapse and increased levels of ProSAP2/Shank3. Moreover, ProSAP1/Shank2(-/-) mutants exhibit fewer dendritic spines and show reduced basal synaptic transmission, a reduced frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents and enhanced N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated excitatory currents at the physiological level. Mutants are extremely hyperactive and display profound autistic-like behavioural alterations including repetitive grooming as well as abnormalities in vocal and social behaviours. By comparing the data on ProSAP1/Shank2(-/-) mutants with ProSAP2/Shank3 alpha beta(-/-) mice, we show that different abnormalities in synaptic glutamate receptor expression can cause alterations in social interactions and communication. Accordingly, we propose that appropriate therapies for autism spectrum disorders are to be carefully matched to the underlying synaptopathic phenotype.","[Schmeisser, Michael J.; Bockmann, Juergen; Kuebler, Angelika; Janssen, Anna-Lena; Udvardi, Patrick T.; Shiban, Ehab; Grabrucker, Andreas M.; Boeckers, Tobias M.] Univ Ulm, Inst Anat & Cell Biol, D-89081 Ulm, Germany; [Ey, Elodie; Leblond, Claire S.; Torquet, Nicolas; Le Sourd, Anne-Marie; Toro, Roberto; Bourgeron, Thomas] Inst Pasteur, CNRS, URA Genes Synapses & Cognit 2182, F-75724 Paris 15, France; [Ey, Elodie; Leblond, Claire S.; Torquet, Nicolas; Le Sourd, Anne-Marie; Toro, Roberto; Bourgeron, Thomas] Univ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, F-75013 Paris, France; [Wegener, Stephanie; Stempel, A.

Shank2 (also known as ProSAP1) is a multi-domain scaffolding protein and signalling adaptor enriched at excitatory neuronal synapses(2-4), and mutations in the human SHANK2 gene have recently been associated with ASD and intellectual disability(5). Although ASD-associated genes are being increasingly identified and studied using various approaches, including mouse genetics(6-16), further efforts are required to delineate important causal mechanisms with the potential for therapeutic application. Here we show that Shank2-mutant (Shank2(-/-)) mice carrying a mutation identical to the ASD-associated microdeletion in the human SHANK2 gene exhibit ASD-like behaviours including reduced social interaction, reduced social communication by ultrasonic vocalizations, and repetitive jumping. These mice show a marked decrease in NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) glutamate receptor (NMDAR) function. Direct stimulation of NMDARs with D-cycloserine, a partial agonist of NMDARs, normalizes NMDAR function and improves social interaction in Shank2(-/-) mice. Furthermore, treatment of Shank2(-/-) mice with a positive allosteric modulator of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), which enhances NMDAR function via mGluR5 activation(17), also normalizes NMDAR function and markedly enhances social interaction. These results suggest that reduced NMDAR function may contribute to the development of ASD-like phenotypes in Shank2(-/-) mice, and mGluR modulation of NMDARs offers a potential strategy to treat ASD.","[Lee, Hye-Ryeon; Kim, Jae-Ick; Kaang, Bong-Kiun] Seoul Natl Univ, Natl Creat Res Initiat Ctr Memory, Dept Biol Sci, Coll Nat Sci, Seoul 151747, South Korea; [Won, Hyejung; Mah, Won; Lee, Jiseok; Ha, Seungmin; Chung, Changuk; Park, Sae-Geun; Kim, Daesoo; Kim, Eunjoon] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Biol Sci, Taejon 305701, South Korea; [Won, Hyejung; Mah, Won; Lee, Jiseok; Ha, Seungmin; Chung, Changuk; Kim, Eunjoon] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Natl Creat Res Initiat Ctr Synaptogenesis, Taejon 305701, South Korea; [Gee, Heon Yung; Jung, Eun Suk; Lee, Jung-Soo; Lee, Min Goo] Yonsei Univ, Dept Pharmacol, Brain Korea Project Med Sci 21, Severance Biomed Sci Inst,Coll Med, Seoul 120752, South Korea; [Cho, Yi Sul; Bae, Yong Chul] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Dept Oral Anat & Neurobiol, Sch Dent, Taegu 700412, South Korea; [Lee, Kyungmin] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Dept Anat, Sch Med, Brain Sci & Engn Inst, Taegu 700412, South Korea; [Kaang, Bong-Kiun] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Seoul 151747, South Korea; [Kim, Eunjoon] World Class Univ, Grad Sch Nanosci & Technol, Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Taejon 305701, South Korea; [Kim, Eunjoon] Inst for Basic Sci Korea, Ctr Synapt Brain Dysfunct, Taejon 305811, South Korea","Kaang, BK (reprint author), Seoul Natl Univ, Natl Creat Res Initiat Ctr Memory, Dept Biol Sci, Coll Nat Sci, Gwanangno 599, Seoul 151747, South Korea.",kaang@snu.ac.kr; mlee@yuhs.ac; kime@kaist.ac.kr,"Kim, Eunjoon/C-1566-2011; Lee, Min Goo/D-5635-2012; Kim, Daesoo/C-1625-2011; Lee, Jiseok/I-9372-2017; Kim, Jae-Ick/R-4007-2017","Lee, Min Goo/0000-0001-7436-012X; Kim, Daesoo/0000-0001-9915-1463; Lee, Jiseok/0000-0002-5966-4237; Kim, Jae-Ick/0000-0001-9705-0394","National Creative Research Initiative Program [2007-0054846]; WCU [2007-0054846, R31-2008-000-10071-0]; Institute for Basic Science; National Research Foundation of Korea [2012-0000812, 2011-0028240]; National Leading Research Laboratory [2011-0028772]; BK21 fellowship; TJ Park Doctoral Fellowship; National Junior Research Fellowship","We would like to thank Macrogen for assistance in the production of mice.

PDA tumours harbour four signature somatic mutations(1-4) in addition to numerous lower frequency genetic events of uncertain significance(5). Here we use Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon-mediated insertional mutagenesis(6,7) in a mouse model of pancreatic ductal preneoplasia(8) to identify genes that cooperate with oncogenic Kras(G12D) to accelerate tumorigenesis and promote progression. Our screen revealed new candidate genes for PDA and confirmed the importance of many genes and pathways previously implicated in human PDA. The most commonly mutated gene was the X-linked deubiquitinase Usp9x, which was inactivated in over 50% of the tumours. Although previous work had attributed a pro-survival role to USP9X in human neoplasia(9), we found instead that loss of Usp9x enhances transformation and protects pancreatic cancer cells from anoikis. Clinically, low USP9X protein and messenger RNA expression in PDA correlates with poor survival after surgery, and USP9X levels are inversely associated with metastatic burden in advanced disease. Furthermore, chromatin modulation with trichostatin A or 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine elevates USP9X expression in human PDA cell lines, indicating a clinical approach for certain patients. The conditional deletion of Usp9x cooperated with Kras(G12D) to accelerate pancreatic tumorigenesis in mice, validating their genetic interaction. We propose that USP9X is a major tumour suppressor gene with prognostic and therapeutic relevance in PDA.","[Rust, Alistair G.; van der Weyden, Louise; Herd, Colin; Stemple, Derek L.; Kettleborough, Ross; Adams, David J.] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Hinxton CB10 1SA, England; [Perez-Mancera, Pedro A.; Tuveson, David A.] Canc Res UK, Li Ka Shing Ctr, Cambridge Res Inst, Cambridge CB2 0RE, England; [Perez-Mancera, Pedro A.; Tuveson, David A.] Dept Oncol, Cambridge CB2 0RE, England; [Kristiansen, Glen] Univ Hosp Bonn, Inst Pathol, D-53127 Bonn, Germany; [Li, Allen; Brosnan, Jacqueline A.; Li, Ang; Morgan, Richard; Knight, Spencer; Yu, Jun; Klein, Alison P.; Goggins, Michael; Hruban, Ralph H.; Iacobuzio-Donahue, Christine A.] Johns Hopkins Med Inst, Dept Oncol, Sol Goldman Pancreat Canc Res Ctr, Baltimore, MD 21231 USA; [Li, Allen; Brosnan, Jacqueline A.; Li, Ang; Morgan, Richard; Knight, Spencer; Yu, Jun; Klein, Alison P.; Goggins, Michael; Hruban, Ralph H.; Iacobuzio-Donahue, Christine A.] Johns Hopkins Med Inst, Dept Pathol, Sol Goldman Pancreat Canc Res Ctr, Baltimore, MD 21231 USA; [Sarver, Aaron L.; Silverstein, Kevin A.

This compartment must be acidified for Salmonella to survive within macrophages(2), possibly because acidic pH promotes expression of Salmonella virulence proteins(3,4). We reasoned that Salmonella might sense its surroundings have turned acidic not only upon protonation of the extracytoplasmic domain of a protein sensor(5) but also by an increase in cytosolic ATP levels, because conditions that enhance the proton gradient across the bacterial inner membrane stimulate ATP synthesis(6,7). Here we report that an increase in cytosolic ATP promotes transcription of the coding region for the virulence gene mgtC, which is the most highly induced horizontally acquired gene when Salmonella is inside macrophages(8). This transcript is induced both upon media acidification and by physiological conditions that increase ATP levels independently of acidification. ATP is sensed by the coupling/uncoupling of transcription of the unusually long mgtC leader messenger RNA and translation of a short open reading frame located in this region. A mutation in the mgtC leader messenger RNA that eliminates the response to ATP hinders mgtC expression inside macrophages and attenuates Salmonella virulence in mice. Our results define a singular example of an ATP-sensing leader messenger RNA. Moreover, they indicate that pathogens can interpret extracellular cues by the impact they have on cellular metabolites.","[Lee, Eun-Jin; Groisman, Eduardo A.] Yale Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Sch Med, Sect Microbial Pathogenesis,Boyer Ctr Mol Med, New Haven, CT 06536 USA; [Lee, Eun-Jin; Groisman, Eduardo A.] Yale Microbial Divers Inst, West Haven, CT 06516 USA","Groisman, EA (reprint author), Yale Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Sch Med, Sect Microbial Pathogenesis,Boyer Ctr Mol Med, 295 Congress Ave, New Haven, CT 06536 USA.",eduardo.groisman@yale.edu,,,National Institutes of Health [AI49561],"We thank C.

An essential part of the T3SS is a hollow needle-like protein filament through which effector proteins are injected into eukaryotic host cells(3-6). Currently, the three-dimensional structure of the needle is unknown because it is not amenable to X-ray crystallography and solution NMR, as a result of its inherent non-crystallinity and insolubility. Cryo-electron microscopy combined with crystal or solution NMR subunit structures has recently provided a powerful hybrid approach for studying supramolecular assemblies(7-12), resulting in low-resolution and medium-resolution models(13-17). However, such approaches cannot deliver atomic details, especially of the crucial subunit-subunit interfaces, because of the limited cryo-electron microscopic resolution obtained in these studies. Here we report an alternative approach combining recombinant wild-type needle production, solid-state NMR, electron microscopy and Rosetta modelling to reveal the supramolecular interfaces and ultimately the complete atomic structure of the Salmonella typhimurium T3SS needle. We show that the 80-residue subunits form a right-handed helical assembly with roughly 11 subunits per two turns, similar to that of the flagellar filament of S. typhimurium. In contrast to established models of the needle in which the amino terminus of the protein subunit was assumed to be alpha-helical and positioned inside the needle, our model reveals an extended amino-terminal domain that is positioned on the surface of the needle, while the highly conserved carboxy terminus points towards the lumen.","[Loquet, Antoine; Giller, Karin; Griesinger, Christian; Becker, Stefan; Lange, Adam] Max Planck Inst Biophys Chem, Dept NMR Based Struct Biol, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Sgourakis, Nikolaos G.; Baker, David] Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Gupta, Rashmi; Kolbe, Michael] Max Planck Inst Infect Biol, Dept Cellular Microbiol, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Riedel, Dietmar] Max Planck Inst Biophys Chem, Lab Electron Microscopy, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Griesinger, Christian] Max Planck Inst Infect Biol, D-10117 Berlin, Germany","Lange, A (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Biophys Chem, Dept NMR Based Struct Biol, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",kolbe@mpiib-berlin.mpg.de; sabe@nmr.mpibpc.mpg.de; adla@nmr.mpibpc.mpg.de,"Loquet, Antoine/A-1465-2010; Baker, David/K-8941-2012","Loquet, Antoine/0000-0001-7176-7813; Baker, David/0000-0001-7896-6217",Max Planck Society; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Fondation Bettencourt Schueller; National Institutes of Health [1 R01 GM092802-01]; EMBO; European Union [261863],"We thank T.

However, the genetic programs that underlie their development and evolution remain poorly understood. Hereweidentify a conserved non-exonic element (E4) that acts as a cortex-specific enhancer for the nearby gene Fezf2 (also known as Fezl and Zfp312), which is required for the specification of corticospinal neuron identity and connectivity. We find that SOX4 and SOX11 functionally compete with the repressor SOX5 in the transactivation of E4. Cortex-specific double deletion of Sox4 and Sox11 leads to the loss of Fezf2 expression, failed specification of corticospinal neurons and, independent of Fezf2, a reeler-like inversion of layers. We show evidence supporting the emergence of functional SOX-binding sites in E4 during tetrapod evolution, and their subsequent stabilization in mammals and possibly amniotes. These findings reveal that SOX transcription factors converge onto a cis-acting element of Fezf2 and form critical components of a regulatory network controlling the identity and connectivity of corticospinal neurons.","[Shim, Sungbo; Kwan, Kenneth Y.; Li, Mingfeng; Sestan, Nenad] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Shim, Sungbo; Kwan, Kenneth Y.; Li, Mingfeng; Sestan, Nenad] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Kavli Inst Neurosci, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Lefebvre, Veronique] Cleveland Clin, Lerner Res Inst, Dept Cell Biol, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA; [Lefebvre, Veronique] Cleveland Clin, Lerner Res Inst, Orthopaed & Rheumatol Res Ctr, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA","Sestan, N (reprint author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, New Haven, CT 06510 USA.",nenad.sestan@yale.edu,"Kwan, Kenneth/F-8489-2011","Kwan, Kenneth/0000-0003-4711-071X","National Institutes of Health [NS054273, MH081896, AR54153]; March of Dimes Foundation; McDonnell Scholar Award","We thank W.

Drosophila genetics and compound profiling defined three pathways accounting for the mechanistic basis of efficacy and dose-limiting toxicity. Inhibition of Ret plus Raf, Src and S6K was required for optimal animal survival, whereas inhibition of the 'anti-target' Tor led to toxicity owing to release of negative feedback. Rational synthetic tailoring to eliminate Tor binding afforded AD80 and AD81, compounds featuring balanced pathway inhibition, improved efficacy and low toxicity in Drosophila and mammalian multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 models.

Unravelling the assembly history of these stellar populations is often restricted because of difficulties in measuring accurate ages for low-mass, hydrogen-burning stars(1,2). Unlike these progenitors, white dwarf stars(3), the 'cinders' of stellar evolution, are remarkably simple objects and their fundamental properties can be measured with little ambiguity(4,5). Here I report observations of newly formed white dwarf stars in the halo of the Milky Way, and a separate analysis of archival data in the well studied 12.5-billion-year-old globular cluster Messier 4. I measure the mass distribution of the remnant stars and invert the stellar evolution process to develop a mathematical relation that links this final stellar mass to the mass of their immediate progenitors, and therefore to the age of the parent population. By applying this technique to a small sample of four nearby and kinematically confirmed halo white dwarf stars, I calculate the age of local field halo stars to be 11.4 +/- 0.7 billion years. The oldest globular clusters formed 13.5 billion years ago. Future observations of newly formed white dwarf stars in the halo could be used to reduce the uncertainty, and to probe relative differences between the formation times of the youngest globular clusters and the inner halo.","[Kalirai, Jason S.] Space Telescope Sci Inst, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Kalirai, Jason S.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Ctr Astrophys Sci, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA","Kalirai, JS (reprint author), Space Telescope Sci Inst, 3700 San Martin Dr, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",jkalirai@stsci.edu,,,W.

Given that the lifetime of methane in the Martian atmosphere is limited(1,6), a process on or below the planet's surface would need to be continuously producing methane. A biological source would provide support for the potential existence of life on Mars, whereas a chemical origin would imply that there are unexpected geological processes(7). Methane release from carbonaceous meteorites associated with ablation during atmospheric entry is considered negligible(8). Here we show that methane is produced in much larger quantities from the Murchison meteorite (a type CM2 carbonaceous chondrite) when exposed to ultraviolet radiation under conditions similar to those expected at the Martian surface. Meteorites containing several per cent of intact organic matter reach the Martian surface at high rates(9), and our experiments suggest that a significant fraction of the organic matter accessible to ultraviolet radiation is converted to methane. Ultraviolet-radiation-induced methane formation from meteorites could explain a substantial fraction of the most recently estimated atmospheric methane mixing ratios(3,4). Stable hydrogen isotope analysis unambiguously confirms that the methane released from Murchison is of extraterrestrial origin. The stable carbon isotope composition, in contrast, is similar to that of terrestrial microbial origin; hence, measurements of this signature in future Mars missions may not enable an unambiguous identification of biogenic methane.","[Keppler, Frank; Vigano, Ivan; Ott, Ulrich] Max Planck Inst Chem, Dept Atmospher Chem, D-55128 Mainz, Germany; [Vigano, Ivan; Fruchtl, Marion; Rockmann, Thomas] Univ Utrecht, Inst Marine & Atmospher Res Utrecht, NL-3584 CC Utrecht, Netherlands; [McLeod, Andy] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH9 3JN, Midlothian, Scotland; [Ott, Ulrich] Univ W Hungary, H-9700 Szombathely, Hungary","Keppler, F (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Chem, Dept Atmospher Chem, Hahn Meitner Weg 1, D-55128 Mainz, Germany.",frank.keppler@mpic.de,"Keppler, Frank/F-4401-2012; Rockmann, Thomas/F-4479-2015","Rockmann, Thomas/0000-0002-6688-8968",ESF; DFG [KE 884/2-1]; Dutch NWO [865.07.001]; NERC [NE/F020422/1]; Royal Society Leverhulme Trust,"F.K. was supported by the ESF (EURYI award to F.

Although past studies have explored these responses during portions of the Cenozoic era (the most recent 65.5 million years (Myr) of Earth history), comparatively little is known about the climate of the late Miocene (similar to 12-5 Myr ago), an interval with p(CO2) values of only 200-350 parts per million by volume but nearly ice-free conditions in the Northern Hemisphere(2,3) and warmer-than-modern temperatures on the continents(4). Here we present quantitative geochemical sea surface temperature estimates from the Miocene mid-latitude North Pacific Ocean, and show that oceanic warmth persisted throughout the interval of low p(CO2) similar to 12-5 Myr ago. We also present new stable isotope measurements from the western equatorial Pacific that, in conjunction with previously published data(5-10), reveal a long-term trend of thermocline shoaling in the equatorial Pacific since similar to 13 Myr ago. We propose that a relatively deep global thermocline, reductions in low-latitude gradients in sea surface temperature, and cloud and water vapour feedbacks may help to explain the warmth of the late Miocene. Additional shoaling of the thermocline after 5 Myr ago probably explains the stronger coupling between p(CO2), sea surface temperatures and climate that is characteristic of the more recent Pliocene and Pleistocene epochs(11,12).","[LaRiviere, Jonathan P.; Ravelo, A.

The low ratios of radiogenic to non-radiogenic xenon (Xe-129/Xe-130) in ocean island basalts (OIBs) compared with mid-ocean-ridge basalts (MORBs) have been used as evidence for the existence of a relatively undegassed primitive deep-mantle reservoir(1). However, the low Xe-129/Xe-130 ratios in OIBs have also been attributed to mixing between subducted atmospheric Xe and MORB Xe, which obviates the need for a less degassed deep-mantle reservoir(3,4). Here I present new noble gas (He, Ne, Ar, Xe) measurements from an Icelandic OIB that reveal differences in elemental abundances and Ne-20/Ne-22 ratios between the Iceland mantle plume and the MORB source. These observations show that the lower Xe-129/Xe-130 ratios in OIBs are due to a lower I/Xe ratio in the OIB mantle source and cannot be explained solely by mixing atmospheric Xe with MORB-type Xe. Because I-129 became extinct about 100 million years after the formation of the Solar System, OIB and MORB mantle sources must have differentiated by 4.45 billion years ago and subsequent mixing must have been limited. The Iceland plume source also has a higher proportion of Pu- to U-derived fission Xe, requiring the plume source to be less degassed than MORBs, a conclusion that is independent of noble gas concentrations and the partitioning behaviour of the noble gases with respect to their radiogenic parents. Overall, these results show that Earth's mantle accreted volatiles from at least two separate sources and that neither the Moon-forming impact nor 4.45 billion years of mantle convection has erased the signature of Earth's heterogeneous accretion and early differentiation.","Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Mukhopadhyay, S (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, 20 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",sujoy@eps.harvard.edu,,,NSF [EAR 0911363],"I thank D.

Further species loss will accelerate change in ecosystem processes(5-8), but it is unclear how these effects compare to the direct effects of other forms of environmental change that are both driving diversity loss and altering ecosystem function. Here we use a suite of meta-analyses of published data to show that the effects of species loss on productivity and decomposition-two processes important in all ecosystems-are of comparable magnitude to the effects of many other global environmental changes. In experiments, intermediate levels of species loss (21-40%) reduced plant production by 5-10%, comparable to previously documented effects of ultraviolet radiation and climate warming. Higher levels of extinction (41-60%) had effects rivalling those of ozone, acidification, elevated CO2 and nutrient pollution. At intermediate levels, species loss generally had equal or greater effects on decomposition than did elevated CO2 and nitrogen addition. The identity of species lost also had a large effect on changes in productivity and decomposition, generating a wide range of plausible outcomes for extinction. Despite the need for more studies on interactive effects of diversity loss and environmental changes, our analyses clearly show that the ecosystem consequences of local species loss are as quantitatively significant as the direct effects of several global change stressors that have mobilized major international concern and remediation efforts(9).","[Hooper, David U.] Western Washington Univ, Dept Biol, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA; [Adair, E.

Historically, low-impact intrusion into species habitats arose from local demands for food, fuel and living space(3). However, in today's increasingly globalized economy, international trade chains accelerate habitat degradation far removed from the place of consumption. Although adverse effects of economic prosperity and economic inequality have been confirmed(4,5), the importance of international trade as a driver of threats to species is poorly understood. Here we show that a significant number of species are threatened as a result of international trade along complex routes, and that, in particular, consumers in developed countries cause threats to species through their demand of commodities that are ultimately produced in developing countries. We linked 25,000 Animalia species threat records from the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List to more than 15,000 commodities produced in 187 countries and evaluated more than 5 billion supply chains in terms of their biodiversity impacts. Excluding invasive species, we found that 30% of global species threats are due to international trade. In many developed countries, the consumption of imported coffee, tea, sugar, textiles, fish and other manufactured items causes a biodiversity footprint that is larger abroad than at home. Our results emphasize the importance of examining biodiversity loss as a global systemic phenomenon, instead of looking at the degrading or polluting producers in isolation.

Consecutive asymmetric divisions of individual radial glial progenitor cells produce a number of sister excitatory neurons that migrate along the elongated radial glial fibre, resulting in the formation of ontogenetic columns(2-4). Moreover, sister excitatory neurons in ontogenetic columns preferentially develop specific chemical synapses with each other rather than with nearby non-siblings(5). Although these findings provide crucial insight into the emergence of functional columns in the neocortex, little is known about the basis of this lineage-dependent assembly of excitatory neuron microcircuits at single-cell resolution. Here we show that transient electrical coupling between radially aligned sister excitatory neurons regulates the subsequent formation of specific chemical synapses in the neocortex. Multiple-electrode whole-cell recordings showed that sister excitatory neurons preferentially form strong electrical coupling with each other rather than with adjacent non-sister excitatory neurons during early postnatal stages. This preferential coupling allows selective electrical communication between sister excitatory neurons, promoting their action potential generation and synchronous firing. Interestingly, although this electrical communication largely disappears before the appearance of chemical synapses, blockade of the electrical communication impairs the subsequent formation of specific chemical synapses between sister excitatory neurons in ontogenetic columns. These results suggest a strong link between lineage-dependent transient electrical coupling and the assembly of precise excitatory neuron microcircuits in the neocortex.","[Yu, Yong-Chun; Fu, Yinghui; Yao, Xing-Hua; Ma, Jian] Fudan Univ, Inst Brain Sci, Inst Neurobiol, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China; [Yu, Yong-Chun; Fu, Yinghui; Yao, Xing-Hua; Ma, Jian] Fudan Univ, State Key Lab Med Neurobiol, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China; [He, Shuijin; Chen, She; Brown, Keith N.; Gao, Kate P.; Shi, Song-Hai] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dev Biol Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Brown, Keith N.; Gao, Kate P.; Shi, Song-Hai] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Grad Program Neurosci, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Sosinsky, Gina E.] Univ Calif San Diego, Natl Ctr Microscopy & Imaging Res, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Sosinsky, Gina E.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Neurosci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Huang, Kun] Ohio State Univ, Comprehens Canc Ctr Biomed Informat Shared Resour, Dept Biomed Informat, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Yu, YC (reprint author), Fudan Univ, Inst Brain Sci, Inst Neurobiol, 138 Yixueyuan Rd, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China.",ycyu@fudan.edu.cn; hes@mskcc.org; shis@mskcc.org,"Huang, Kun/E-3272-2011",,"Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2012CB966300]; Natural Science Foundation of China [31121061, 31070947]; Shanghai Science and Technology Committee [10PJ1400700]; Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China [20100071120061]; National Institutes of Health [R01DA024681, R21NS072483, R21MH083624, R01GM065947]; McKnight Foundation; March of Dimes Foundation","We thank the following: C.

In the visual cortex, functional columns consisting of neurons with similar orientation preferences have been characterized extensively(2-4), but how these columns are constructed during development remains unclear(5). The radial unit hypothesis(6) posits that the ontogenetic columns formed by clonally related neurons migrating along the same radial glial fibre during corticogenesis(7) provide the basis for functional columns in adult neocortex(1). However, a direct correspondence between the ontogenetic and functional columns has not been demonstrated(8). Here we show that, despite the lack of a discernible orientation map in mouse visual cortex(4,9,10), sister neurons in the same radial clone exhibit similar orientation preferences. Using a retroviral vector encoding green fluorescent protein to label radial clones of excitatory neurons, and in vivo two-photon calcium imaging to measure neuronal response properties, we found that sister neurons preferred similar orientations whereas nearby non-sister neurons showed no such relationship. Interestingly, disruption of gap junction coupling by viral expression of a dominant-negative mutant of Cx26 (also known as Gjb2) or by daily administration of a gap junction blocker, carbenoxolone, during the first postnatal week greatly diminished the functional similarity between sister neurons, suggesting that the maturation of ontogenetic into functional columns requires intercellular communication through gap junctions. Together with the recent finding of preferential excitatory connections among sister neurons(11), our results support the radial unit hypothesis and unify the ontogenetic and functional columns in the visual cortex.","[Li, Ye; Lu, Hui; Cheng, Pei-lin; Dan, Yang] Univ Calif Berkeley, Helen Wills Neurosci Inst, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Div Neurobiol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Li, Ye; Lu, Hui; Dan, Yang] Univ Calif Berkeley, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Ge, Shaoyu] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Neurobiol & Behav, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Xu, Huatai; Shi, Song-Hai] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dev Biol Program, New York, NY 10065 USA","Dan, Y (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Helen Wills Neurosci Inst, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Div Neurobiol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",ydan@berkeley.edu,"Lu, Hui/K-2322-2013","Dan, Yang/0000-0002-3818-877X","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R01 EY018861, R01 DA024681, R21NS072483]; NSF [22250400-42533]","This work was supported by National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant R01 EY018861 and NSF grant 22250400-42533 (to Y.D.), and NIH grants R01 DA024681 and R21NS072483 (to S.-H.

Control of active zone VGCC abundance and function remains poorly understood. Here we show that a trafficking step probably sets synaptic VGCC levels in rats, because overexpression of the pore-forming alpha 1(A) VGCC subunit fails to change synaptic VGCC abundance or function. alpha 2 delta s are a family of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored VGCC-associated subunits(3) that, in addition to being the target of the potent neuropathic analgesics gabapentin and pregabalin (alpha 2 delta-1 and alpha 2 delta-2)(4,5), were also identified in a forward genetic screen for pain genes (alpha 2 delta-3)(6). We show that these proteins confer powerful modulation of presynaptic function through two distinct molecular mechanisms. First, alpha 2 delta subunits set synaptic VGCC abundance, as predicted from their chaperone-like function when expressed in non-neuronal cells(3,7). Second, alpha 2 delta s configure synaptic VGCCs to drive exocytosis through an extracellular metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS), a conserved set of amino acids within the predicted von Willebrand A domain of alpha 2 delta. Expression of alpha 2 delta with an intact MIDAS motif leads to an 80% increase in release probability, while simultaneously protecting exocytosis from blockade by an intracellular Ca2+ chelator. alpha 2 delta s harbouring MIDAS site mutations still drive synaptic accumulation of VGCCs; however, they no longer change release probability or sensitivity to intracellular Ca2+ chelators. Our data reveal dual functionality of these clinically important VGCC subunits, allowing synapses to make more efficient use of Ca2+ entry to drive neurotransmitter release.","[Hoppa, Michael B.; Ryan, Timothy A.] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Biochem, New York, NY 10023 USA; [Lana, Beatrice; Margas, Wojciech; Dolphin, Annette C.] UCL, Dept Neurosci Physiol & Pharmacol, Lab Cellular & Mol Neurosci, London WC1E 6BT, England","Ryan, TA (reprint author), Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Biochem, New York, NY 10023 USA.",taryan@med.cornell.edu,"Dolphin, Annette/F-7416-2010","Dolphin, Annette/0000-0003-4626-4856; Ryan, Timothy/0000-0003-2533-9548","Medical Research Council [G0700368, G0801756, G0901758]; NIMH NIH HHS [R01 MH085783, R01 MH085783-01A1, R01 MH085783-02, R01 MH085783-03, R01 MH085783-04]",,,34,116,119,2,40,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,7-Jun,2012,486,7401,,,,,122,U149,,10.1038/nature11033,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,953GD,WOS:000304854000040,22678293.0,No,,,11/20/17,timothy a.,ryan,na,na,na,na,na
