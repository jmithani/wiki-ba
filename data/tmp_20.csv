The current model of arterial - venous identity proposes that binding of vascular endothelial growth factor to its heterodimeric receptor - Flk1 and neuropilin 1 (NP-1; also called Nrp1) - activates the Notch signalling pathway in the endothelium, causing induction of ephrin B2 expression and suppression of ephrin receptor B4 expression to establish arterial identity(1-4). Little is known about vein identity except that it involves ephrin receptor B4 expression, because Notch signalling is not activated in veins; an unresolved question is how vein identity is regulated. Here, we show that COUP-TFII ( also known as Nr2f2), a member of the orphan nuclear receptor superfamily, is specifically expressed in venous but not arterial endothelium. Ablation of COUP-TFII in endothelial cells enables veins to acquire arterial characteristics, including the expression of arterial markers NP-1 and Notch signalling molecules, and the generation of haematopoietic cell clusters. Furthermore, ectopic expression of COUP-TFII in endothelial cells results in the fusion of veins and arteries in transgenic mouse embryos. Thus, COUP-TFII has a critical role in repressing Notch signalling to maintain vein identity, which suggests that vein identity is under genetic control and is not derived by a default pathway.","Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; Baylor Coll Med, Dev Biol Program, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Tsai, MJ (reprint author), Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",mtsai@bcm.tmc.edu; stsai@bcm.tmc.edu,,"LIN, FU-JUNG/0000-0003-4065-0983",,,,27,319,329,1,9,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-May,2005,435,7038,,,,,98,104,,10.1038/nature03511,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,922UL,WOS:000228864600046,15875024.0,No,,,11/20/17,sy,tsai,male,0.65,20,na,na

Low implantation rate is a major problem during infertility treatments using assisted reproductive technologies(1). Here we report a newly discovered molecular influence on implantation through the lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor LPA(3) (refs 2 - 4). Targeted deletion of LPA(3) in mice resulted in significantly reduced litter size, which could be attributed to delayed implantation and altered embryo spacing. These two events led to delayed embryonic development, hypertrophic placentas shared by multiple embryos and embryonic death. An enzyme demonstrated to influence implantation, cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) (ref. 5), was downregulated in LPA(3)-deficient uteri during preimplantation. Downregulation of COX2 led to reduced levels of prostaglandins E-2 and I-2 (PGE(2) and PGI(2)), which are critical for implantation(1). Exogenous administration of PGE(2) or carbaprostacyclin ( a stable analogue of PGI(2)) into LPA(3)-deficient female mice rescued delayed implantation but did not rescue defects in embryo spacing. These data identify LPA(3) receptor-mediated signalling as having an influence on implantation, and further indicate linkage between LPA signalling and prostaglandin biosynthesis.","Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol Biol, Helen L Dorris Child & Adolescent Neuropsychiat D, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Med, Dept Dev Med Technol Sankyo, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; Washington State Univ, Sch Mol Biosci, Ctr Reprod Biol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; Obihiro Univ Agr & Vet Med, Natl Res Ctr Protozoan Dis, Obihiro, Hokkaido 0808555, Japan","Chun, J (reprint author), Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol Biol, Helen L Dorris Child & Adolescent Neuropsychiat D, 10550 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",jchun@scripps.edu,,"Aoki, Junken/0000-0001-9435-1896",NIMH NIH HHS [K02 MH001723],,,30,307,326,0,14,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-May,2005,435,7038,,,,,104,108,,10.1038/nature03505,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,922UL,WOS:000228864600047,15875025.0,No,,,11/20/17,j,chun,na,na,na,na,na

Whether the inability of HIV to infect these resting CD4(+) T cells is due to the lack of a key factor, or alternatively reflects the presence of an efficient mechanism for defence against HIV, is not clear. Here we show that the anti-retroviral deoxycytidine deaminase APOBEC3G(5) strongly protects unstimulated peripheral blood CD4(+) T cells against HIV-1 infection. In activated CD4(+) T cells, cytoplasmic APOBEC3G resides in an enzymatically inactive, high-molecular-mass (HMM) ribonucleoprotein complex that converts to an enzymatically active low-molecular-mass (LMM) form after treatment with RNase. In contrast, LMM APOBEC3G predominates in unstimulated CD4(+) T cells, where HIV-1 replication is blocked and reverse transcription is impaired(1-3). Mitogen activation induces the recruitment of LMM APOBEC3G into the HMM complex, and this correlates with a sharp increase in permissivity for HIV infection in these stimulated cells. Notably, when APOBEC3G-specific small interfering RNAs are introduced into unstimulated CD4(+) T cells, the early replication block encountered by HIV-1 is greatly relieved. Thus, LMM APOBEC3G functions as a potent post-entry restriction factor for HIV-1 in unstimulated CD4(+) T cells. Surprisingly, sequencing of the reverse transcripts slowly formed in unstimulated CD4(+) T cells reveals only low levels of dG --> dA hypermutation, raising the possibility that the APOBEC3G-restricting activity may not be strictly dependent on deoxycytidine deamination.","Univ Calif San Francisco, Gladstone Inst Virol & Immunol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Med, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Microbiol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Immunol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Greene, WC (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Gladstone Inst Virol & Immunol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",wgreene@gladstone.ucsf.edu,,,,,,30,353,365,0,13,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-May,2005,435,7038,,,,,108,114,,10.1038/nature03493,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,922UL,WOS:000228864600048,15829920.0,No,,,11/20/17,wc,greene,female,0.98,57,na,na

The bipolar organization of spindles is essential for proper segregation of chromosomes, and requires plus-end-directed homotetrameric motor proteins of the widely conserved kinesin-5 ( BimC) family(3). Hypotheses for bipolar spindle formation include the 'push-pull mitotic muscle' model, in which kinesin-5 and opposing motor proteins act between overlapping microtubules(2,4,5). However, the precise roles of kinesin-5 during this process are unknown. Here we show that the vertebrate kinesin-5 Eg5 drives the sliding of microtubules depending on their relative orientation. We found in controlled in vitro assays that Eg5 has the remarkable capability of simultaneously moving at similar to 20 nm s(-1) towards the plus-ends of each of the two microtubules it crosslinks. For anti-parallel microtubules, this results in relative sliding at similar to 40 nm s(-1), comparable to spindle pole separation rates in vivo(6). Furthermore, we found that Eg5 can tether microtubule plus-ends, suggesting an additional microtubule-binding mode for Eg5. Our results demonstrate how members of the kinesin-5 family are likely to function in mitosis, pushing apart interpolar microtubules as well as recruiting microtubules into bundles that are subsequently polarized by relative sliding.","Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Phys & Astron, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Ctr Laser, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; Rockefeller Univ, Lab Chem & Cell Biol, New York, NY 10021 USA","Peterman, EJG (reprint author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Phys & Astron, Boelelaan 1081, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",erwinp@nat.vu.nl; kapoor@mail.rockefeller.edu,"Schmidt, Christoph/G-3787-2011; Peterman, Erwin/G-5529-2010; Kapitein, Lukas/J-4776-2016","Schmidt, Christoph/0000-0003-2864-6973; Peterman, Erwin/0000-0003-1058-249X; Kapitein, Lukas/0000-0001-9418-6739",,,,27,328,337,1,34,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-May,2005,435,7038,,,,,114,118,,10.1038/nature03503,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,922UL,WOS:000228864600049,15875026.0,No,,,11/20/17,cf,schmidt,male,0.88,8,na,na

In addition, de novo designed(5-12) oscillators(13,14) have been demonstrated, using components that are not part of the natural oscillators. Such oscillators are useful in testing the design principles and in exploring potential applications not limited by natural cellular behaviour(15). To achieve transcriptional and metabolic integration characteristic of natural oscillators, here we designed and constructed a synthetic circuit in Escherichia coli K12, using glycolytic flux to generate oscillation through the signalling metabolite acetyl phosphate. If two metabolite pools are interconverted by two enzymes that are placed under the transcriptional control of acetyl phosphate, the system oscillates when the glycolytic rate exceeds a critical value. We used bifurcation analysis to identify the boundaries of oscillation, and verified these experimentally. This work demonstrates the possibility of using metabolic flux as a control factor in system-wide oscillation, as well as the predictability of a de novo gene - metabolic circuit designed using nonlinear dynamic analysis.","Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Chem Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Biomed Engn Interdepartmental Program, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Liao, JC (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Chem Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",liaoj@ucla.edu,"Hsing-Yen, Su/G-9552-2014","Bulter, Thomas/0000-0002-7968-5844",,,,29,242,253,2,33,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-May,2005,435,7038,,,,,118,122,,10.1038/nature03508,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,922UL,WOS:000228864600050,15875027.0,No,,,11/20/17,jc,liao,male,0.95,208,Qi06GzQAAAAJ,21634

Determining which genes underlie this phenotype could shed light on the mechanisms and functions of sleep. To do so, we performed mutagenesis in Drosophila melanogaster, because flies also sleep for many hours and, when sleep deprived, show sleep rebound and performance impairments. By screening 9,000 mutant lines, we found minisleep (mns), a line that sleeps for one-third of the wild-type amount. We show that mns flies perform normally in a number of tasks, have preserved sleep homeostasis, but are not impaired by sleep deprivation. We then show that mns flies carry a point mutation in a conserved domain of the Shaker gene. Moreover, after crossing out genetic modifiers accumulated over many generations, other Shaker alleles also become short sleepers and fail to complement the mns phenotype. Finally, we show that short-sleeping Shaker flies have a reduced lifespan. Shaker, which encodes a voltage-dependent potassium channel controlling membrane repolarization and transmitter release, may thus regulate sleep need or efficiency.","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychiat, Madison, WI 53719 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Genet Lab, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Tononi, G (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychiat, 6001 Res Pk Blvd, Madison, WI 53719 USA.",gtononi@wisc.edu,"Tononi, Giulio/B-8387-2009","Hill, Sean/0000-0001-8055-860X",,,,50,216,226,2,24,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Apr,2005,434,7037,,,,,1087,1092,,10.1038/nature03486,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,920MD,WOS:000228693300032,15858564.0,No,,,11/20/17,g,tononi,male,0.83,23,na,na

The mechanism underlying this depletion of memory CD4(+) T cells (that is, T-helper cells specific to previously encountered pathogens) has not been defined. Using highly sensitive, quantitative polymerase chain reaction together with precise sorting of different subsets of CD4(+) T cells in various tissues, we show that this loss is explained by a massive infection of memory CD4(+) T cells by the virus. Specifically, 30-60% of CD4(+) memory T cells throughout the body are infected by SIV at the peak of infection, and most of these infected cells disappear within four days. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that the depletion of memory CD4(+) T cells occurs to a similar extent in all tissues. As a consequence, over one-half of all memory CD4(+) T cells in SIV-infected macaques are destroyed directly by viral infection during the acute phase-an insult that certainly heralds subsequent immunodeficiency.

Here we report the detection of a long (380 s) giant flare from SGR 1806-20, which was much more luminous than any previous transient event observed in our Galaxy. (In the first 0.2 s, the flare released as much energy as the Sun radiates in a quarter of a million years.) Its power can be explained by a catastrophic instability involving global crust failure and magnetic reconnection on a magnetar, with possible large-scale untwisting of magnetic field lines outside the star.

On 27 December 2004, a giant flare(4) with a fluence(5) exceeding 0.3 erg cm(-2) was detected from SGR 1806-20. Here we report the detection of a fading radio counterpart to this event. We began a monitoring programme from 0.2 to 250 GHz and obtained a high-resolution 21-cm radio spectrum that traces the intervening interstellar neutral hydrogen clouds. Analysis of the spectrum yields the first direct distance measurement of SGR 1806-20: the source is located at a distance greater than 6.4 kpc and we argue that it is nearer than 9.8 kpc. If correct, our distance estimate lowers the total energy of the explosion and relaxes the demands on theoretical models. The energetics and the rapid decay of the radio source are not compatible with the afterglow model that is usually invoked for gamma-ray bursts. Instead, we suggest that the rapidly decaying radio emission arises from the debris ejected during the explosion.","CALTECH, Div Phys Math & Astron, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; Tata Inst Fundamental Res, Bombay 400005, Maharashtra, India; Indian Inst Sci, Joint Astron Programme, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India; Natl Radio Astron Observ, Socorro, NM 87801 USA; CSIRO, Australia Telescope Natl Facil, Epping, NSW 1710, Australia; Shanghai Astron Observ, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China; Natl Astron Observ, Nobeyama Radio Observ, Minamisa Ku, Nagano 3841305, Japan; Tokyo Inst Technol, Dept Phys, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1528551, Japan; Max Planck Inst Radioastron, D-53121 Bonn, Germany; Univ Bonn, D-53121 Bonn, Germany","Cameron, PB (reprint author), CALTECH, Div Phys Math & Astron, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",pbc@astro.caltech.edu,,,,,,26,99,99,0,5,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Apr,2005,434,7037,,,,,1112,1115,,10.1038/nature03605,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,920MD,WOS:000228693300038,15858569.0,No,,,11/20/17,f,bertoldi,male,0.67,6,na,na

However, attempts to produce fusion in a room temperature solid-state setting, including 'cold' fusion(5) and 'bubble' fusion(6), have met with deep scepticism(7). Here we report that gently heating a pyroelectric crystal in a deuterated atmosphere can generate fusion under desktop conditions. The electrostatic field of the crystal is used to generate and accelerate a deuteron beam (>100 keV and >4 nA), which, upon striking a deuterated target, produces a neutron flux over 400 times the background level. The presence of neutrons from the reaction D + D -> He-3 (820 keV) + n (2.45 MeV) within the target is confirmed by pulse shape analysis and proton recoil spectroscopy. As further evidence for this fusion reaction, we use a novel time-of-flight technique to demonstrate the delayed coincidence between the outgoing alpha-particle and the neutron. Although the reported fusion is not useful in the power-producing sense, we anticipate that the system will find application as a simple palm-sized neutron generator.","Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Phys, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Chem, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, CNSI, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Naranjo, B (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Phys, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",naranjo@physics.ucla.edu,,,,,,21,121,122,1,65,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,28-Apr,2005,434,7037,,,,,1115,1117,,10.1038/nature03575,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,920MD,WOS:000228693300039,15858570.0,No,,,11/20/17,s,putterman,male,0.67,42,na,na

There is widespread evidence for Heinrich events and their profound impact on the climate and circulation of the North Atlantic Ocean, but their influence beyond that region remains uncertain(1). Here we use a combination of molecular fingerprints of algal productivity and radioisotope tracers of sedimentation to document eight periods of increased productivity in the subpolar Southern Ocean during the past 70,000 years that occurred within 1,000-2,000 years of a Northern Hemisphere Heinrich event. We discuss possible causes for such a link, including increased supply of iron from upwelling and increased stratification during the growing season, which imply an alteration of the global ocean circulation during Heinrich events. The mechanisms linking North Atlantic iceberg discharges with subantarctic productivity remain unclear at this point. We suggest that understanding how the Southern Ocean was altered during these extreme climate perturbations is critical to understanding the role of the ocean in climate change.","MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA","Sachs, JP (reprint author), MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, 77 Massachusetts Ave,Room E34-254, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",jsachs@mit.edu,,"Anderson, Robert/0000-0002-8472-2494",,,,30,73,75,0,29,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Apr,2005,434,7037,,,,,1118,1121,,10.1038/nature03544,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,920MD,WOS:000228693300040,15858571.0,No,,,11/20/17,rf,anderson,male,1,1,na,na

Geoposition data delineate two populations, one using spawning grounds in the Gulf of Mexico and another from the Mediterranean Sea. Transatlantic movements of western-tagged bluefin tuna reveal site fidelity to known spawning areas in the Mediterranean Sea. Bluefin tuna that occupy western spawning grounds move to central and eastern Atlantic foraging grounds. Our results are consistent with two populations of bluefin tuna with distinct spawning areas that overlap on North Atlantic foraging grounds. Electronic tagging locations, when combined with US pelagic longline observer and logbook catch data, identify hot spots for spawning bluefin tuna in the northern slope waters of the Gulf of Mexico.

Although there is evidence for kin-biased helping behaviour in several species(1,4,5), the mechanism of kin recognition underlying this behaviour is poorly understood(2). Vocalizations are the most commonly used cues in avian recognition systems(6,7), but the effectiveness of vocal signals as reliable recognition cues must depend on how they are acquired(6-9). However, there have been no experimental studies of the development of vocal recognition cues in cooperative birds; indeed, the ontogeny of all bird vocalizations other than song is poorly known in any species(10-12). Here, we show that cooperatively breeding long-tailed tits (Aegithalos caudatus) can discriminate between kin and non-kin according to the individual-specific characteristics of contact calls, and show experimentally that individuals learn these calls from provisioning adults during the nestling period. Finally, we show that the pattern of cooperative behaviour in this species is consistent with the use of recognition cues learned through association.","Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Evolut & Behav Grp, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; Univ Exeter Cornwall, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Marine Turtle Res Grp, Penryn TR10 9EZ, England; Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Edward Grey Inst Field Ornithol, Oxford OX1 3PS, England","Sharp, SP (reprint author), Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Evolut & Behav Grp, Western Bank, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",s.sharp@sheffield.ac.uk,"Wood, Matthew/B-6124-2011; Sharp, Stuart/F-8246-2014; Hatchwell, Ben/C-5433-2016","Wood, Matthew/0000-0003-0920-8396; Sharp, Stuart/0000-0002-3059-2532; Hatchwell, Ben/0000-0002-1039-4782",,,,28,133,138,8,106,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Apr,2005,434,7037,,,,,1127,1130,,10.1038/nature03522,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,920MD,WOS:000228693300042,15858573.0,No,,,11/20/17,bj,hatchwell,male,0.78,121,na,na

It typically involves cell-cell communication and intracellular signal processing. Here we show a synthetic multicellular system in which genetically engineered 'receiver' cells are programmed to formring-like patterns of differentiation based on chemical gradients of an acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) signal that is synthesized by 'sender' cells. In receiver cells, 'band-detect' gene networks respond to user-defined ranges of AHL concentrations. By fusing different fluorescent proteins as outputs of network variants, an initially undifferentiated 'lawn' of receivers is engineered to form a bullseye pattern around a sender colony. Other patterns, such as ellipses and clovers, are achieved by placing senders in different configurations. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal which kinetic parameters most significantly affect ring development over time. Construction and study of such synthetic multicellular systems can improve our quantitative understanding of naturally occurring developmental processes and may foster applications in tissue engineering, biomaterial fabrication and biosensing.","Princeton Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; Princeton Univ, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; CALTECH, Div Chem & Chem Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Weiss, R (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",rweiss@princeton.edu,"Gerchman, Yoram/F-5226-2015","Gerchman, Yoram/0000-0002-8637-9589",,,,18,536,558,6,143,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Apr,2005,434,7037,,,,,1130,1134,,10.1038/nature03461,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,920MD,WOS:000228693300043,15858574.0,No,,,11/20/17,r,weiss,male,0.79,42,na,na
