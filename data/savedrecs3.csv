They are also invaluable tools for scientific exploration in environments inaccessible to humans, from distant planets(6) to deep oceans(7). A major obstacle to their widespread adoption in more complex environments outside factories is their fragility(6,8). Whereas animals can quickly adapt to injuries, current robots cannot 'think outside the box' to find a compensatory behaviour when they are damaged: they are limited to their pre-specified self-sensing abilities, can diagnose only anticipated failure modes(9), and require a pre-programmed contingency plan for every type of potential damage, an impracticality for complex robots(6,8). A promising approach to reducing robot fragility involves having robots learn appropriate behaviours in response to damage(10,11), but current techniques are slow even with small, constrained search spaces(12). Here we introduce an intelligent trial- and-error algorithm that allows robots to adapt to damage in less than two minutes in large search spaces without requiring self-diagnosis or pre-specified contingency plans. Before the robot is deployed, it uses a novel technique to create a detailed map of the space of high-performing behaviours. This map represents the robot's prior knowledge about what behaviours it can perform and their value. When the robot is damaged, it uses this prior knowledge to guide a trial-and-error learning algorithm that conducts intelligent experiments to rapidly discover a behaviour that compensates for the damage. Experiments reveal successful adaptations for a legged robot injured in five different ways, including damaged, broken, and missing legs, and for a robotic arm with joints broken in 14 different ways. This new algorithm will enable more robust, effective, autonomous robots, and may shed light on the principles that animals use to adapt to injury.","[Cully, Antoine; Tarapore, Danesh; Mouret, Jean-Baptiste] Univ Paris 06, Sorbonne Univ, UMR 7222, ISIR, F-75005 Paris, France; [Cully, Antoine; Tarapore, Danesh; Mouret, Jean-Baptiste] CNRS, UMR 7222, ISIR, F-75005 Paris, France; [Clune, Jeff] Univ Wyoming, Dept Comp Sci, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Mouret, Jean-Baptiste] Inria, Team Larsen, F-54600 Villers Les Nancy, France; [Mouret, Jean-Baptiste] CNRS, Loria, UMR 7503, F-54500 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France; [Mouret, Jean-Baptiste] Univ Lorraine, Loria, UMR 7503, F-54500 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France","Mouret, JB (reprint author), Univ Paris 06, Sorbonne Univ, UMR 7222, ISIR, F-75005 Paris, France.",jean-baptiste.mouret@inria.fr,,"Mouret, Jean-Baptiste/0000-0002-2513-027X",ANR Creadapt project [ANR-12-JS03-0009]; European Research Council (ERC) under European Union [637972]; Direction Generale de l'Armement (DGA) scholarship,"We thank L.

Prominently, this is manifested in the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) in sea surface temperatures. Positive (negative) phases of the AMO coincide with warmer (colder) North Atlantic sea surface temperatures. The AMO is linked with decadal climate fluctuations, such as Indian and Sahel rainfall(1), European summer precipitation(2), Atlantic hurricanes(3) and variations in global temperatures(4). It is widely believed that ocean circulation drives the phase changes of the AMO by controlling ocean heat content(5). However, there are no direct observations of ocean circulation of sufficient length to support this, leading to questions about whether the AMO is controlled from another source(6). Here we provide observational evidence of the widely hypothesized link between ocean circulation and the AMO. We take a new approach, using sea level along the east coast of the United States to estimate ocean circulation on decadal timescales. We show that ocean circulation responds to the first mode of Atlantic atmospheric forcing, the North Atlantic Oscillation, through circulation changes between the subtropical and subpolar gyres-the intergyre region(7). These circulation changes affect the decadal evolution of North Atlantic heat content and, consequently, the phases of the AMO. The Atlantic overturning circulation is declining(8) and the AMO is moving to a negative phase. This may offer a brief respite from the persistent rise of global temperatures(4), but in the coupled system we describe, there are compensating effects. In this case, the negative AMO is associated with a continued acceleration of sea-level rise along the northeast coast of the United States(9,10).","[McCarthy, Gerard D.; Hirschi, Joel J. -M.; Grist, Jeremy P.; Smeed, David A.] Univ Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England; [Haigh, Ivan D.] Univ Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr, Ocean & Earth Sci, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England","McCarthy, GD (reprint author), Univ Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr, Waterfront Campus,European Way, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England.",gerard.mccarthy@noc.ac.uk,"Jeremy, Grist/B-4517-2012",,UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) RAPID-WATCH programme; UK NERC consortium project iGlass [NE/I009906/1]; NERC,G.D.M. and D.A.S. are supported by the UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) RAPID-WATCH programme.

In cortex, however, these patterns lie in a space of lower dimension(1-4), as if individual neurons were ""obedientmembers of a huge orchestra''(5). Here we use recordings from the visual cortex of mouse (Mus musculus) and monkey (Macaca mulatta) to investigate the relationship between individual neurons and the population, and to establish the underlying circuit mechanisms. We show that neighbouring neurons can differ in their coupling to the overall firing of the population, ranging from strongly coupled 'choristers' to weakly coupled 'soloists'. Population coupling is largely independent of sensory preferences, and it is a fixed cellular attribute, invariant to stimulus conditions. Neurons with high population coupling are more strongly affected by non-sensory behavioural variables such as motor intention. Population coupling reflects a causal relationship, predicting the response of a neuron to optogenetically driven increases in local activity. Moreover, population coupling indicates synaptic connectivity; the population coupling of a neuron, measured in vivo, predicted subsequent in vitro estimates of the number of synapses received from its neighbours. Finally, population coupling provides a compact summary of population activity; knowledge of the population couplings of n neurons predicts a substantial portion of their n(2) pairwise correlations. Population coupling therefore represents a novel, simple measure that characterizes the relationship of each neuron to a larger population, explaining seemingly complex network firing patterns in terms of basic circuit variables.","[Okun, Michael; Steinmetz, Nicholas A.; Harris, Kenneth D.] UCL, UCL Inst Neurol, London WC1N 3BG, England; [Okun, Michael; Steinmetz, Nicholas A.; Cossell, Lee; Iacaruso, M.

While cyclic 'rock-paper-scissors' interactions can stabilize communities in spatial environments(9-11), coexistence in unstructured environments remains unexplained(12,16). Here, using simulations and analytical models, we show that the opposing actions of antibiotic production and degradation enable coexistence even in well-mixed environments. Coexistence depends on three-way interactions in which an antibiotic-degrading species attenuates the inhibitory interactions between two other species. These interactions enable coexistence that is robust to substantial differences in inherent species growth rates and to invasion by 'cheating' species that cease to produce or degrade antibiotics. At least two antibiotics are required for stability, with greater numbers of antibiotics enabling more complex communities and diverse dynamic behaviours ranging from stable fixed points to limit cycles and chaos. Together, these results show how multi-species antibiotic interactions can generate ecological stability in both spatially structured and mixed microbial communities, suggesting strategies for engineering synthetic ecosystems and highlighting the importance of toxin production and degradation for microbial biodiversity.","[Kelsic, Eric D.; Zhao, Jeffrey; Kishony, Roy] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Vetsigian, Kalin] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Bacteriol, Madison, WI 53715 USA; [Vetsigian, Kalin] Univ Wisconsin, Wisconsin Inst Discovery, Madison, WI 53715 USA; [Kishony, Roy] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Dept Biol, IL-3200003 Haifa, Israel; [Kishony, Roy] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, IL-3200003 Haifa, Israel","Vetsigian, K (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Bacteriol, Madison, WI 53715 USA.",kalin@discovery.wisc.edu; rkishony@technion.ac.il,,"Kelsic, Eric/0000-0002-5331-5204","Department of Defense, Office of Naval Research, National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) Fellowship [32 CFR 168a]; Research Science Institute at MIT; University of Wisconsin-Madison; James S.

Agenetic contributionis strongly suggested by the association of CHD with chromosome abnormalities and high recurrence risk(4). Here we report findings from a recessive forward genetic screen in fetal mice, showing that cilia and ciliatransduced cell signalling have important roles in the pathogenesis of CHD. The cilium is an evolutionarily conserved organelle projecting from the cell surface with essential roles in diverse cellular processes. Using echocardiography, we ultrasound scanned 87,355 chemically mutagenized C57BL/6J fetal mice and recovered 218 CHD mouse models. Whole-exome sequencing identified 91 recessive CHD mutations in 61 genes. This included 34 cilia-related genes, 16 genes involved in cilia-transduced cell signalling, and 10 genes regulating vesicular trafficking, a pathway important for ciliogenesis and cell signalling. Surprisingly, many CHD genes encoded interacting proteins, suggesting that an interactome protein network may provide a larger genomic context for CHD pathogenesis. These findings provide novel insights into the potential Mendelian genetic contribution to CHD in the fetal population, a segment of the human population not well studied. We note that the pathways identified show overlap with CHD candidate genes recovered in CHD patients(5), suggesting that they may have relevance to the more complex genetics of CHD overall. These CHD mouse models and >8,000 incidental mutations have been sperm archived, creating a rich public resource for human disease modelling.","[Li, You; Klena, Nikolai T.; Gabriel, George C.; Liu, Xiaoqin; Kim, Andrew J.; Lemke, Kristi; Chen, Yu; Chatterjee, Bishwanath; Damerla, Rama Rao; Chang, Chienfu; Yagi, Hisato; Anderton, Shane; Lawhead, Caroline; Vescovi, Anita; Francis, Richard; Tobita, Kimimasa; Lo, Cecilia W.] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Dev Biol, Pittsburgh, PA 15201 USA; [Devine, William] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; [San Agustin, Jovenal T.; Pazour, Gregory J.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Program Mol Med, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Thahir, Mohamed; Ganapathiraju, Madhavi K.] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Biomed Informat, Pittsburgh, PA 15206 USA; [Thahir, Mohamed; Ganapathiraju, Madhavi K.] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Arts & Sci, Intelligent Syst Program, Pittsburgh, PA 16260 USA; [Pratt, Herbert; Morgan, Judy; Haynes, Leslie; Smith, Cynthia L.; Eppig, Janan T.; Reinholdt, Laura] Jackson Lab, Bar Harbor, ME 04609 USA; [Leatherbury, Linda] Childrens Natl Med Ctr, Ctr Heart, Washington, DC 20010 USA","Lo, CW (reprint author), Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Dev Biol, Pittsburgh, PA 15201 USA.",cel36@pitt.edu,"Francis, Richard/P-2524-2015; Smith, Cynthia/A-5646-2009","Smith, Cynthia/0000-0003-3691-0324; Pratt, Herb/0000-0002-4964-8292; Damerla, Rama Rao/0000-0001-6815-0097; Ganapathiraju, Madhavi/0000-0002-3825-0924; Pazour, Gregory/0000-0002-6285-8796","National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute [U01HL098180, U01HL098188]; National Institute of Mental Health [R01MH094564]; National Human Genome Research Institute [HG000330]; University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine","We thank R.

Here we show that mitophagy, a selective type of autophagy targeting mitochondria for degradation, interfaces with mitochondrial biogenesis to regulate mitochondrial content and longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans. We find that DCT-1 is a key mediator of mitophagy and longevity assurance under conditions of stress in C. elegans. Impairment of mitophagy compromises stress resistance and triggers mitochondrial retrograde signalling through the SKN-1 transcription factor that regulates both mitochondrial biogenesis genes and mitophagy by enhancing DCT-1 expression. Our findings reveal a homeostatic feedback loop that integrates metabolic signals to coordinate the biogenesis and turnover of mitochondria.

Anterograde transport through the Golgi has been explained by the movement of Golgi cisternae, known as cisternal maturation(3-5). Because this explanation is now appreciated to be incomplete(6), interest has developed in understanding tubules that connect the Golgi cisternae(7-9). Here we show that the coat protein (COPI) complex sorts anterograde cargoes into these tubules in human cells. Moreover, the small GTPase CDC42 regulates bidirectional Golgi transport by targeting the dual functions of COPI in cargo sorting and carrier formation. CDC42 also directly imparts membrane curvature to promote COPI tubule formation. Our findings further reveal that COPI tubular transport complements cisternal maturation in explaining how anterograde Golgi transport is achieved, and that bidirectional COPI transport is modulated by environmental cues through CDC42.","[Park, Seung-Yeol; Yang, Jia-Shu; Hsu, Victor W.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Rheumatol Immunol & Allergy, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Park, Seung-Yeol; Yang, Jia-Shu; Schmider, Angela B.; Soberman, Roy J.; Hsu, Victor W.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Schmider, Angela B.; Soberman, Roy J.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Div Nephrol, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Schmider, Angela B.; Soberman, Roy J.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Med, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Soberman, Roy J.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Mol Imaging Core, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA","Hsu, VW (reprint author), Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Rheumatol Immunol & Allergy, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",vhsu@research.bwh.harvard.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health [R01GM058615, R01AI068871, R01AR065538, 1S10RR027931-01, K01DK089145]; National Research Foundation of Korea [2014R1A6A3A03056673]","We thank J.

Here we reconstitute RISC assembly using only Ago2, Dicer-2, R2D2, Hsc70, Hsp90, Hop, Droj2 (an Hsp40 homologue) and p23. By following the assembly of single RISC molecules, we find that, in the absence of the chaperone machinery, an siRNA bound to Dicer-2-R2D2 associates with Ago2 only transiently. The chaperone machinery extends the dwell time of the Dicer-2-R2D2-siRNA complex on Ago2, in a manner dependent on recognition of the 59-phosphate on the siRNA guide strand. We propose that the chaperone machinery supports a productive state of Ago2, allowing it to load siRNA duplexes from Dicer-2-R2D2 and thereby assemble RISC.","[Iwasaki, Shintaro; Sasaki, Hiroshi M.; Tomari, Yukihide] Univ Tokyo, Inst Mol & Cellular Biosci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130032, Japan; [Sakaguchi, Yuriko; Suzuki, Tsutomu] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Chem & Biotechnol, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Tadakuma, Hisashi; Tomari, Yukihide] Univ Tokyo, Dept Med Genome Sci, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130032, Japan","Tomari, Y (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Inst Mol & Cellular Biosci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130032, Japan.",tadakuma@k.u-tokyo.ac.jp; tomari@iam.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Suzuki, Tsutomu/J-1776-2015; Iwasaki, Shintaro/D-1472-2017","Suzuki, Tsutomu/0000-0002-9731-1731; Iwasaki, Shintaro/0000-0001-7724-3754; Tomari, Yukihide/0000-0001-8442-0851","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology in Japan","We thank Q.

By fuelling the generation of genetic alterations and by compromising cell viability, genomic instability is a driving force in cancer and ageing(1,2). Here we identify MAD2L2 (also known as MAD2B or REV7) through functional genetic screening as a novel factor controlling DNA repair activities at mammalian telomeres. We show that MAD2L2 accumulates at uncapped telomeres and promotes non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ)-mediated fusion of deprotected chromosome ends and genomic instability. MAD2L2 depletion causes elongated 39 telomeric overhangs, indicating that MAD2L2 inhibits 59 end resection. End resection blocks NHEJ while committing to homology-directed repair, and is under the control of 53BP1, RIF1 and PTIP3. Consistent with MAD2L2 promoting NHEJ-mediated telomere fusion by inhibiting 5' end resection, knockdown of the nucleases CTIP or EXO1 partially restores telomere-driven genomic instability in MAD2L2-depleted cells. Control of DNA repair by MAD2L2 is not limited to telomeres. MAD2L2 also accumulates and inhibits end resection at irradiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks and promotes end-joining of DNA double-strand breaks in several settings, including during immunoglobulin class switch recombination. These activities of MAD2L2 depend on ATM kinase activity, RNF8, RNF168, 53BP1 and RIF1, but not on PTIP, REV1 and REV3, the latter two acting with MAD2L2 in translesion synthesis(4). Together, our data establish MAD2L2 as a crucial contributor to the control of DNA repair activity by 53BP1 that promotes NHEJ by inhibiting 5' end resection downstream of RIF1.","[Boersma, Vera; Moatti, Nathalie; Segura-Bayona, Sandra; Peuscher, Marieke H.; van der Torre, Jaco; Wevers, Brigitte A.; Jacobs, Jacqueline J.

In the absence of BRCA1-mediated HR, the administration of PARP inhibitors induces synthetic lethality of tumour cells of patients with breast or ovarian cancers(2,3). Despite the benefit of this tailored therapy, drug resistance can occur by HR restoration(4). Genetic reversion of BRCA1-inactivating mutations can be the underlying mechanism of drug resistance, but this does not explain resistance in all cases(5). In particular, little is known about BRCA1-independent restoration of HR. Here we show that loss of REV7 (also known as MAD2L2) in mouse and human cell lines re-establishes CTIP-dependent endresection of DSBs in BRCA1 deficient cells, leading to HR restoration and PARP inhibitor resistance, which is reversed by ATM kinase inhibition. REV7 is recruited to DSBs in a manner dependent on the H2AX-MDC1-RNF8-RNF168-53BP1 chromatin pathway, and seems to block HR and promote end joining in addition to its regulatory role in DNA damage tolerance(6). Finally, we establish that REV7 blocks DSB resection to promote non-homologous end-joining during immunoglobulin class switch recombination. Our results reveal an unexpected crucial function of REV7 downstream of 53BP1 in coordinating pathological DSB repair pathway choices in BRCA1-deficient cells.","[Xu, Guotai; Gogola, Ewa; Barazas, Marco; Jaspers, Janneke E.; Kersbergen, Ariena; Sol, Wendy; Borst, Piet; Rottenberg, Sven] Netherlands Canc Inst, Div Mol Oncol, NL-1066 CX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Chapman, J.

Protective antigen forms oligomeric prepores that undergo conversion to membrane-spanning pores by endosomal acidification, and these pores translocate the enzymes lethal factor and oedema factor into the cytosol of target cells(1). Protective antigen is not only a vaccine component and therapeutic target for anthrax infections but also an excellent model system for understanding the mechanism of protein translocation. On the basis of biochemical and electrophysiological results, researchers have proposed that a phi (Phi)-clamp composed of phenylalanine (Phe)427 residues of protective antigen catalyses protein translocation via a charge-state-dependent Brownian ratchet(2-9). Although atomic structures of protective antigen prepores are available(10-14), how protective antigen senses low pH, converts to active pore, and translocates lethal factor and oedema factor are not well defined without an atomic model of its pore. Here, by cryoelectron microscopy with direct electron counting, we determine the protective antigen pore structure at 2.9-angstrom resolution. The structure reveals the long-sought-after catalytic Phi-clamp and the membrane-spanning translocation channel, and supports the Brownian ratchet model for protein translocation. Comparisons of four structures reveal conformational changes in prepore to pore conversion that support a multi-step mechanism by which low pH is sensed and the membrane-spanning channel is formed.","[Jiang, Jiansen; Zhou, Z.

Transitory pluripotent cells can be captured at different time points during embryogenesis and maintained as embryonic stem cells or epiblast stem cells in culture. Since ontogenesis is a dynamic process in both space and time, it seems counterintuitive that these two temporal states represent the full spectrum of organismal pluripotency. Here we show that by modulating culture parameters, a stem-cell type with unique spatial characteristics and distinct molecular and functional features, designated as region-selective pluripotent stem cells (rsPSCs), can be efficiently obtained from mouse embryos and primate pluripotent stem cells, including humans. The ease of culturing and editing the genome of human rsPSCs offers advantages for regenerative medicine applications. The unique ability of human rsPSCs to generate post-implantation interspecies chimaeric embryos may facilitate our understanding of early human development and evolution.","[Wu, Jun; Okamura, Daiji; Li, Mo; Suzuki, Keiichiro; Ma, Li; Li, Zhongwei; Tamura, Isao; Krause, Marie N.; Hishida, Tomoaki; Takahashi, Yuta; Aizawa, Emi; Kim, Na Young; Esteban, Concepcion Rodriguez; Belmonte, Juan Carlos Izpisua] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Gene Express Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Luo, Chongyuan; Ecker, Joseph R.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Howard Hughes Med Inst, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Luo, Chongyuan; He, Yupeng; Nery, Joseph R.; Zhang, Zhuzhu; Ecker, Joseph R.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Genom Anal Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Benner, Chris] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Integrated Genom, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Du, Tingting; Ren, Bing] Univ Calif San Diego, Ludwig Inst Canc Res, Sch Med, Dept Cellular & Mol Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Hishida, Tomoaki] Univ Tsukuba, Tsukuba Adv Res Alliance, Life Sci Ctr, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058577, Japan; [Lajara, Jeronimo; Guillen, Pedro] Univ Catolica, Med, Guadalupe 30107, Spain; [Guillen, Pedro] Fdn Pedro Guillen, Clin Cemtro, Madrid 28035, Spain; [Campistol, Josep M.] Hosp Clin Barcelona, E-08036 Barcelona, Spain; [Ross, Pablo J.] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Saghatelian, Alan] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Peptide Biol Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Belmonte, JCI (reprint author), Salk Inst Biol Studies, Gene Express Lab, 10010 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",belmonte@salk.edu,"Ecker, Joseph/B-9144-2008","Ecker, Joseph/0000-0001-5799-5895; Wu, Jun/0000-0001-9863-1668; Lajara Blesa, Jeronimo/0000-0003-1859-8998",California Institute for Regenerative Medicine Training Grant; UCAM; Fundacion Pedro Guillen; G.

Although they are used empirically to measure cosmological distances(4-6), the nature of their progenitors remains mysterious(3). One of the leading progenitor models, called the single degenerate channel, hypothesizes that a white dwarf accretes matter from a companion star and the resulting increase in its central pressure and temperature ignites thermonuclear explosion(3,7,8). Here we report observations with the Swift Space Telescope of strong but declining ultraviolet emission from a type Ia supernova within four days of its explosion. This emission is consistent with theoretical expectations of collision between material ejected by the supernova and a companion star(9), and therefore provides evidence that some type Ia supernovae arise from the single degenerate channel.","[Cao, Yi; Kulkarni, S.

For mechanical oscillators these have primarily been realized using coherent wavepackets, for which the distinguishability arises as a result of the spatial separation of the superposed states(3-5). Here we demonstrate superpositions composed of squeezed wavepackets, which we generate by applying an internal-state-dependent force to a single trapped ion initialized in a squeezed vacuum state with nine decibel reduction in the quadrature variance. This allows us to characterize the initial squeezed wavepacket by monitoring the onset of spin-motion entanglement, and to verify the evolution of the number states of the oscillator as a function of the duration of the force. In both cases we observe clear differences between displacements aligned with the squeezed and anti-squeezed axes. We observe coherent revivals when inverting the state-dependent force after separating the wavepackets by more than 19 times the ground-state root mean squared extent, which corresponds to 56 times the root mean squared extent of the squeezed wavepacket along the displacement direction.

The hallmark of Joulian magnetostriction is volume conservation(2), which is a broader definition applicable to self-accommodation of ferromagnetic, ferroelectric or ferroelastic domains in all functional materials(3-10). Here we report the discovery of 'giant' non-volume-conserving or non-Joulian magnetostriction (NJM). Whereas Joulian strain is caused by magnetization rotation, NJM is caused by facile (low-field) reorientation of magnetoelastically and magnetostatically autarkic (self-sufficient) rigid micro-'cells', which define the adaptive structure, the origin of which is proposed to be elastic gradients ultimately caused by charge/spin density waves(11-13). The equilibrium adaptive cellular structure is responsible for long-sought non-dissipative (hysteresis-free), linearly reversible and isotropic magnetization curves along all directions within a single crystal. Recently discovered Fe-based high magnetostriction alloys(14,15) with special thermal history are identified as the first members of this newly discovered magnetic class. The NJM paradigm provides consistent interpretations of seemingly confounding properties of Fe-based alloys, offers recipes to develop new highly magnetostrictive materials, and permits simultaneously large actuation in longitudinal and transverse directions without the need for stacked composites.","[Chopra, Harsh Deep] Temple Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Lab Quantum Mat & Devices, Mat Genom Lab, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Chopra, Harsh Deep] Temple Univ, Temple Mat Inst, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Wuttig, Manfred] Univ Maryland, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Chopra, HD (reprint author), Temple Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Lab Quantum Mat & Devices, Mat Genom Lab, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",chopra@temple.edu; wuttig@umd.edu,,,"National Science Foundation DMR-Metals grant [1206397]; National Science Foundation DMR-Condensed Matter Physics grants [1541236, 0964830]","The authors appreciate the donation of single crystals by T.

In the absence of selection, polymorphisms are expected to be a randomsubset of new mutations; thus, comparing the effects of polymorphisms and new mutations provides a test for selection(1-4). When evidence of selection exists, such comparisons can identify properties of mutations that are most likely to persist in natural populations(2). Here we investigate how mutation and selection have shaped variation in a cis-regulatory sequence controlling gene expression by empirically determining the effects of polymorphisms segregating in the TDH3 promoter among 85 strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and comparing their effects to a distribution of mutational effects defined by 236 point mutations in the same promoter. Surprisingly, we find that selection on expression noise (that is, variability in expression among genetically identical cells(5)) appears to have had a greater impact on sequence variation in the TDH3 promoter than selection on mean expression level. This is not necessarily because variation in expression noise impacts fitness more than variation in mean expression level, but rather because of differences in the distributions of mutational effects for these two phenotypes. This study shows how systematically examining the effects of new mutations can enrich our understanding of evolutionary mechanisms. It also provides rare empirical evidence of selection acting on expression noise.","[Metzger, Brian P.

Projections from the auditory cortex to the auditory striatum carry information that drives decisions in an auditory frequency discrimination task(1). To assess the role of these projections in learning, we developed a channelrhodopsin-2-based assay to probe selectively for synaptic plasticity associated with corticostriatal neurons representing different frequencies. Here we report that learning this auditory discrimination preferentially potentiates corticostriatal synapses from neurons representing either high or low frequencies, depending on reward contingencies. We observe frequency-dependent corticostriatal potentiation in vivo over the course of training, and in vitro in striatal brain slices. Our findings suggest a model in which the corticostriatal synapses made by neurons tuned to different features of the sound are selectively potentiated to enable the learned transformation of sound into action.","[Xiong, Qiaojie; Znamenskiy, Petr; Zador, Anthony M.] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; [Znamenskiy, Petr] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Watson Sch Biol Sci, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA","Zador, AM (reprint author), Cold Spring Harbor Lab, 1 Bungtown Rd, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA.",zador@cshl.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health [R01DC012565, R01NS088649]; Swartz Foundation","We thank B.

Despite recent reports claiming substantially increased reprogramming efficiencies using genetically modified donor cells(12,13), prospectively isolating distinct reprogramming intermediates remains an important goal to decipher reprogramming mechanisms. Previous attempts to identify surface markers of intermediate cell populations were based on the assumption that, during reprogramming, cells progressively lose donor cell identity and gradually acquire iPS cell properties(1,2,7,8,10). Here we report that iPS cell and epithelial markers, such as SSEA1 and EpCAM, respectively, are not predictive of reprogramming during early phases. Instead, in a systematic functional surface marker screen, we find that early reprogramming-prone cells express a unique set of surface markers, including CD73, CD49d and CD200, that are absent in both fibroblasts and iPS cells. Single-cell mass cytometry and prospective isolation show that these distinct intermediates are transient and bridge the gap between donor cell silencing and pluripotency marker acquisition during the early, presumably stochastic, reprogramming phase(2). Expression profiling reveals early upregulation of the transcriptional regulators Nr0b1 and Etv5 in this reprogramming state, preceding activation of key pluripotency regulators such asRex1 (also known as Zfp42), Dppa2, Nanog and Sox2. Both factors are required for the generation of the early intermediate state and fully reprogrammed iPS cells, and thus represent some of the earliest known regulators of iPS cell induction. Our study deconvolutes the first steps in a hierarchical series of events that lead to pluripotency acquisition.","[Lujan, Ernesto; Ng, Yi Han; Goronzy, Isabel N.; Wernig, Marius] Stanford Univ, Inst Stem Cell Biol & Regenerat Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lujan, Ernesto] Stanford Univ, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lujan, Ernesto; Ng, Yi Han; Goronzy, Isabel N.; Wernig, Marius] Stanford Univ, Dept Pathol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Zunder, Eli R.; Nolan, Garry P.] Stanford Univ, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Baxter Lab Stem Cell Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Ng, Yi Han] Stanford Univ, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Wernig, M (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Inst Stem Cell Biol & Regenerat Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",wernig@stanford.edu,,,California Institute of Regenerative Medicine [RB2-01592]; Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine at Stanford; New York Stem Cell Foundation-Robertson Investigator Award; California Institute for Regenerative Medicine Predoctoral Fellowship [TG2-01159]; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship [DGE-114747]; National Institutes of Health National Research Service Award [F32 GM093508-01],"We thank P.

In similar to 25% of cases, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) cells carry the oncogenic BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase (Philadelphia chromosome positive), which mimics constitutively active pre-BCR signalling(4,5). Current therapeutic approaches are largely focused on the development of more potent tyrosine kinase inhibitors to suppress oncogenic signalling below a minimum threshold for survival(6). We tested the hypothesis that targeted hyperactivation-above a maximum threshold-will engage a deletional checkpoint for removal of self-reactive B cells and selectively kill ALL cells. Here we find, by testing various components of proximal pre-BCR signalling in mouse BCR-ABL1 cells, that an incremental increase of Syk tyrosine kinase activity was required and sufficient to induce cell death. Hyperactive Syk was functionally equivalent to acute activation of a self-reactive BCR on ALL cells. Despite oncogenic transformation, this basic mechanism of negative selection was still functional in ALL cells. Unlike normal pre-B cells, patient-derived ALL cells express the inhibitory receptors PECAM1, CD300A and LAIR1 at high levels. Genetic studies revealed that Pecam1, Cd300a and Lair1 are critical to calibrate oncogenic signalling strength through recruitment of the inhibitory phosphatases Ptpn6 (ref. 7) and Inpp5d (ref. 8). Using a novel small-molecule inhibitor of INPP5D (also known as SHIP1)(9), we demonstrated that pharmacological hyperactivation of SYK and engagement of negative B-cell selection represents a promising new strategy to overcome drug resistance in human ALL.","[Chen, Zhengshan; Shojaee, Seyedmehdi; Buchner, Maike; Geng, Huimin; Lee, JaeWoong; Klemm, Lars; Park, Eugene; Lowell, Clifford A.; Mueschen, Markus] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Lab Med, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Titz, Boern; Graeber, Thomas G.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Crump Inst Mol Imaging, Dept Mol & Med Pharmacol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Tan, Ying Xim; Weiss, Arthur] Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Med,Div Rheumatol, Rosalind Russell Ephraim P Engleman Med Res Ctr A, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Satterthwaite, Anne] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Internal Med, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Paietta, Elisabeth] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Med, Bronx, NY 10466 USA; [Hunger, Stephen P.] Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Div Pediat Oncol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Hunger, Stephen P.] Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Ctr Childhood Canc Res, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Willman, Cheryl L.] Univ New Mexico, Ctr Canc, Albuquerque, NM 87102 USA; [Melnick, Ari] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Med, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Melnick, Ari] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Pharmacol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Loh, Mignon L.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Pediat Hematol Oncol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Jung, Jae U.] Univ So Calif, Dept Mol Microbiol & Immunol, Los Angeles, CA 90033 USA; [Coligan, John E.] NIAID, Receptor Cell Biol Sect, Immunogenet Lab, NIH, Rockville, MD 20852 USA; [Bolland, Silvia] NIAID, Autoimmun & Funct Genom Sect, Immunogenet Lab, NIH, Rockville, MD 20852 USA; [Mak, Tak W.] Univ Hlth Network, Campbell Family Inst Breast Canc Res, Toronto, ON M5G 2M9, Canada; [Limnander, Andre] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Anat, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Jumaa, Hassan] Univ Clin Ulm, Inst Immunol, D-89081 Ulm, Germany; [Reth, Michael] Univ Freiburg, BIOSS Ctr Biol Signalling Studies, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Reth, Michael] Univ Freiburg, Fac Biol, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Reth, Michael] MPI Immunbiol & Epigenet, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany","Muschen, M (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Lab Med, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",markus.muschen@ucsf.edu,"Titz, Bjoern/G-6317-2017","Titz, Bjoern/0000-0003-4414-4105; Graeber, Thomas/0000-0001-8574-9181","National Institutes of Health/National Cancer Institute [R01CA137060, R01CA139032, R01CA169458, R01CA172558, R01CA157644]; ECOG-ACRIN [CA180820, CA180794]; Leukemia and Lymphoma Society; California Institute for Regenerative Medicine [TR02-1816]; William Lawrence and Blanche Hughes Foundation; DFG [EXC294, TRR130, SFB746]","We thank R.

Following injury, culture or transplantation, stem cells outside their niche often display fate flexibility(1-4). Here we show that super-enhancers(5) underlie the identity, lineage commitment and plasticity of adult stem cells in vivo. Using hair follicle as a model, we map the global chromatin domains of hair follicle stem cells and their committed progenitors in their native microenvironments. We show that super-enhancers and their dense clusters ('epicentres') of transcription factor binding sites undergo remodelling upon lineage progression. New fate is acquired by decommissioning old and establishing new super-enhancers and/or epicentres, an auto-regulatory process that abates one master regulator subset while enhancing another. We further show that when outside their niche, either in vitro or in wound-repair, hair follicle stem cells dynamically remodel super-enhancers in response to changes in their microenvironment. Intriguingly, some key super-enhancers shift epicentres, enabling their genes to remain active and maintain a transitional state in an ever-changing transcriptional landscape. Finally, we identify SOX9 as a crucial chromatin rheostat of hair follicle stem cell super-enhancers, and provide functional evidence that super-enhancers are dynamic, dense transcription-factor-binding platforms which are acutely sensitive to pioneer master regulators whose levels define not only spatial and temporal features of lineage-status but also stemness, plasticity in transitional states and differentiation.","[Adam, Rene C.; Yang, Hanseul; Larsen, Samantha B.; Nikolova, Maria; Oristian, Daniel S.; Polak, Lisa; Kadaja, Meelis; Asare, Amma; Fuchs, Elaine] Rockefeller Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Lab Mammalian Cell Biol & Dev, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Rockowitz, Shira; Zheng, Deyou] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Genet, Bronx, NY 10461 USA; [Zheng, Deyou] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Neurol, Bronx, NY 10461 USA; [Zheng, Deyou] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Neurosci, Bronx, NY 10461 USA","Fuchs, E (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Lab Mammalian Cell Biol & Dev, New York, NY 10065 USA.",fuchslb@rockefeller.edu,,"Zheng, Deyou/0000-0003-4354-5337","Anderson Cancer Center Graduate Student Fellowship; National Institutes of Health [R01-AR31737, R21MH099452]","We thank S.

However, some long Drosophila melanogaster introns contain a cryptic site, known as a recursive splice site (RS-site), that enables a multi-step process of intron removal termed recursive splicing(1,2). The extent to which recursive splicing occurs in other species and its mechanistic basis have not been examined. Here we identify highly conserved RS-sites in genes expressed in the mammalian brain that encode proteins functioning in neuronal development. Moreover, the RS-sites are found in some of the longest introns across vertebrates. We find that vertebrate recursive splicing requires initial definition of an 'RS-exon' that follows the RS-site. The RS-exon is then excluded from the dominant mRNA isoform owing to competition with a reconstituted 59 splice site formed at the RS-site after the first splicing step. Conversely, the RS-exon is included when preceded by cryptic promoters or exons that fail to reconstitute an efficient 59 splice site. Most RS-exons contain a premature stop codon such that their inclusion can decrease mRNA stability. Thus, by establishing a binary splicing switch, RS-sites demarcate different mRNA isoforms emerging from long genes by coupling cryptic elements with inclusion of RS-exons.","[Sibley, Christopher R.; Blazquez, Lorea; Haberman, Nejc; Trabzuni, Daniah; Ryten, Mina; Hardy, John; Ule, Jernej] UCL Inst Neurol, Dept Mol Neurosci, London WC1N 3BG, England; [Sibley, Christopher R.; Briese, Michael; Modic, Miha; Ule, Jernej] MRC Lab Mol Biol, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England; [Emmett, Warren; Plagnol, Vincent] UCL, Genet Inst, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Faro, Ana; Wilson, Stephen W.] UCL, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Briese, Michael] Univ Wurzburg, Inst Clin Neurobiol, D-97078 Wurzburg, Germany; [Trabzuni, Daniah] King Faisal Specialist Hosp & Res Ctr, Dept Genet, Riyadh 11211, Saudi Arabia; [Ryten, Mina; Weale, Michael E.] Kings Coll London, Guys Hosp, Dept Med & Mol Genet, London SE1 9RT, England; [Modic, Miha] Helmholtz Ctr Munich, Inst Stem Cell Res, German Res Ctr Environm Hlth, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany; [Curk, Tomaz] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Comp & Informat Sci, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia","Ule, J (reprint author), UCL Inst Neurol, Dept Mol Neurosci, Queen Sq, London WC1N 3BG, England.",v.plagnol@ucl.ac.uk; j.ule@ucl.ac.uk,"Hardy, John/C-2451-2009; Zebrafish, UCL/A-3125-2009; Wilson, Stephen/B-9404-2008; Weale, Michael/F-2587-2010; Ule, Jernej/C-6315-2013","Wilson, Stephen/0000-0002-8557-5940; Sibley, Christopher/0000-0002-8286-4683; Blazquez Garcia, Lorea/0000-0003-2885-3286; Weale, Michael/0000-0003-4593-1186; Ule, Jernej/0000-0002-2452-4277; Modic, Miha/0000-0002-2894-7218; Plagnol, Vincent/0000-0002-5597-9215","European Research Council [206726-CLIP, 617837-Translate]; Marie Curie Post-doctoral Research Fellowship (627783-NeuroCRYSP); Slovenian Research Agency [J7-5460]; UK NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital; UCL Institute of Ophthalmology; Wellcome Trust; UK Medical Research Council (MRC) [U105185858]; MRC [G0901254, G0802462]; MRC Sudden Death Brain Bank","We thank S.

Here we identify 197 zero nucleotide exon ratchet points in 130 introns of 115 Drosophila genes from total RNA sequencing data generated from developmental time points, dissected tissues and cultured cells. The sequential nature of recursive splicing was confirmed by identification of lariat introns generated by splicing to and from the ratchet points. We also show that recursive splicing is a constitutive process, that depletion of U2AF inhibits recursive splicing, and that the sequence and function of ratchet points are evolutionarily conserved in Drosophila. Finally, we identify four recursively spliced human genes, one of which is also recursively spliced in Drosophila. Together, these results indicate that recursive splicing is commonly used in Drosophila, occurs in humans, and provides insight into the mechanisms by which some large introns are removed.","[Duff, Michael O.; Olson, Sara; Wei, Xintao; Garrett, Sandra C.; Osman, Ahmad; Bolisetty, Mohan; Plocik, Alex; Graveley, Brenton R.] Univ Connecticut, Ctr Hlth, Inst Syst Genom, Dept Genet & Genome Sci, Farmington, CT 06030 USA; [Celniker, Susan E.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Dept Genome Dynam, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Graveley, BR (reprint author), Univ Connecticut, Ctr Hlth, Inst Syst Genom, Dept Genet & Genome Sci, Farmington, CT 06030 USA.",graveley@uchc.edu,"Graveley, Brenton/C-3108-2013","Graveley, Brenton/0000-0001-5777-5892","NHGRI [U54HG006994, R01GM095296]","This work was supported by NHGRI grant U54HG006994 to S.E.C.

Our results provide strong support for hypotheses in which the eukaryotic host evolved from a bona fide archaeon, and demonstrate that many components that underpin eukaryote-specific features were already present in that ancestor.

Behavioural responses due to deviation from homeostasis are critical for survival, but motivational processes engaged by physiological need states are incompletely understood. We examined motivational characteristics of two separate neuron populations that regulate energy and fluid homeostasis by using cell-type-specific activity manipulations in mice. We found that starvation-sensitive AGRP neurons exhibit properties consistent with a negative-valence teaching signal. Mice avoided activation of AGRP neurons, indicating that AGRP neuron activity has negative valence. AGRP neuron inhibition conditioned preference for flavours and places. Correspondingly, deep-brain calcium imaging revealed that AGRP neuron activity rapidly reduced in response to food-related cues. Complementary experiments activating thirst-promoting neurons also conditioned avoidance. Therefore, these need-sensing neurons condition preference for environmental cues associated with nutrient or water ingestion, which is learned through reduction of negative-valence signals during restoration of homeostasis.","[Betley, J.

In mammalian brains, head direction cells integrate these two streams of information by representing an animal's heading relative to landmarks, yet maintaining their directional tuning in darkness based on self-motion cues. Here we use two-photon calcium imaging in head-fixed Drosophila melanogaster walking on a ball in a virtual reality arena to demonstrate that landmark-based orientation and angular path integration are combined in the population responses of neurons whose dendrites tile the ellipsoid body, a toroidal structure in the centre of the fly brain. The neural population encodes the fly's azimuth relative to its environment, tracking visual landmarks when available and relying on self-motion cues in darkness. When both visual and self-motion cues are absent, a representation of the animal's orientation is maintained in this network through persistent activity, a potential substrate for short-term memory.

The primary mechanism responsible for quenching star formation in galaxies and transforming them into quiescent and passive systems is still unclear. Sudden removal of gas through outflows(1-6) or stripping(7-9) is one of the mechanisms often proposed. An alternative mechanism is so-called ""strangulation''(10-14), in which the supply of cold gas to the galaxy is halted. Here we report an analysis of the stellar metallicity (the fraction of elements heavier than helium in stellar atmospheres) in local galaxies, from 26,000 spectra, that clearly reveals that strangulation is the primary mechanism responsible for quenching star formation, with a typical timescale of four billion years, at least for local galaxies with a stellar mass less than 10(11) solar masses. This result is further supported independently by the stellar age difference between quiescent and star-forming galaxies, which indicates that quiescent galaxies of less than 10(11) solar masses are on average observed four billion years after quenching due to strangulation.","[Peng, Y.; Maiolino, R.; Cochrane, R.] Univ Cambridge, Cavendish Lab, Cambridge CB3 0HE, England; [Peng, Y.; Maiolino, R.] Univ Cambridge, Kavli Inst Cosmol, Cambridge CB3 0HA, England; [Cochrane, R.] Royal Observ, Inst Astron, Edinburgh EH9 3HJ, Midlothian, Scotland","Peng, Y (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Cavendish Lab, 19 JJ Thomson Ave, Cambridge CB3 0HE, England.",yp244@mrao.cam.ac.uk,,"Cochrane, Rachel/0000-0001-8855-6107",,,,41,88,89,1,9,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,14-May,2015,521,7551,,,,,192,+,,10.1038/nature14439,,11,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,CH9SY,WOS:000354377800052,25971510,No,Y,N,11/20/17

It exhibits an extremely low carrier density threshold for superconductivity(2), and possesses a phase diagram similar to that of high-temperature superconductors(3,4)-two factors that suggest an unconventional pairing mechanism. Despite sustained interest for 50 years, direct experimental insight into the nature of electron pairing in SrTiO3 has remained elusive. Here we perform transport experiments with nanowire-based single-electron transistors at the interface between SrTiO3 and a thin layer of lanthanum aluminate, LaAlO3. Electrostatic gating reveals a series of two-electron conductance resonances-paired electron states-that bifurcate above a critical pairing field B-p of about 1-4 tesla, an order of magnitude larger than the superconducting critical magnetic field. For magnetic fields below B-p, these resonances are insensitive to the applied magnetic field; for fields in excess of B-p, the resonances exhibit a linear Zeeman-like energy splitting. Electron pairing is stable at temperatures as high as 900 millikelvin, well above the superconducting transition temperature (about 300 millikelvin). These experiments demonstrate the existence of a robust electronic phase in which electrons pair without forming a superconducting state. Key experimental signatures are captured by a model involving an attractive Hubbard interaction that describes real-space electron pairing as a precursor to superconductivity.","[Cheng, Guanglei; Tomczyk, Michelle; Lu, Shicheng; Veazey, Joshua P.; Huang, Mengchen; Irvin, Patrick; Levy, Jeremy] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Phys & Astron, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Cheng, Guanglei; Tomczyk, Michelle; Lu, Shicheng; Huang, Mengchen; Irvin, Patrick; Levy, Jeremy] Pittsburgh Quantum Inst, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Ryu, Sangwoo; Lee, Hyungwoo; Eom, Chang-Beom] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Hellberg, C.

The transfer of an optical phase onto a quantum wavefunction is a defining aspect of coherent interactions and forms the basis of quantum state preparation, synchronization and metrology. Light-phase-modulated electron states near atoms and molecules are essential for the techniques of attosecond science, including the generation of extreme-ultraviolet pulses and orbital tomography(2,3). In contrast, the quantum-coherent phase-modulation of energetic free-electron beams has not been demonstrated, although it promises direct access to ultrafast imaging and spectroscopy with tailored electron pulses on the attosecond scale. Here we demonstrate the coherent quantum state manipulation of free-electron populations in an electron microscope beam. We employ the interaction of ultrashort electron pulses with optical nearfields(4-9) to induce Rabi oscillations in the populations of electron momentum states, observed as a function of the optical driving field. Excellent agreement with the scaling of an equal-Rabi multi-level quantum ladder is obtained(10), representing the observation of a light-driven 'quantum walk'(5) coherently reshaping electron density in momentum space(11). We note that, after the interaction, the optically generated superposition of momentum states evolves into a train of attosecond electron pulses. Our results reveal the potential of quantum control for the precision structuring of electron densities, with possible applications ranging from ultrafast electron spectroscopy and microscopy to accelerator science and free-electron lasers.","[Feist, Armin; Echternkamp, Katharina E.; Schauss, Jakob; Yalunin, Sergey V.; Schaefer, Sascha; Ropers, Claus] Univ Gottingen, Inst Phys 4, Solids & Nanostruct, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany","Schafer, S (reprint author), Univ Gottingen, Inst Phys 4, Solids & Nanostruct, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",schaefer@ph4.physik.uni-goettingen.de; cropers@gwdg.de,"Ropers, Claus/D-4843-2015; Feist, Armin/K-3050-2017","Ropers, Claus/0000-0002-9539-3817; Feist, Armin/0000-0003-1434-8895; Priebe, Katharina/0000-0002-1808-3188",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [DFG-SFB 1073]; VolkswagenStiftung; Lower Saxony Ministry of Science and Culture,"We thank M.

On geological timescales, the balance between sequestration of POC from the terrestrial biosphere and oxidation of rock-derived (petrogenic) organic carbon sets the magnitude of the atmospheric carbon and oxygen reservoirs(6,7). Over shorter timescales, variations in the rate of exchange between carbon reservoirs, such as soils and marine sediments, also modulate atmospheric carbon dioxide levels(1). The respective fluxes of biospheric and petrogenic organic carbon are poorly constrained, however, and mechanisms controlling POC export have remained elusive, limiting our ability to predict POC fluxes quantitatively as a result of climatic or tectonic changes. Here we estimate biospheric and petrogenic POC fluxes for a suite of river systems representative of the natural variability in catchment properties. We show that export yields of both biospheric and petrogenic POC are positively related to the yield of suspended sediment, revealing that POC export is mostly controlled by physical erosion. Using a global compilation of gauged suspended sediment flux, we derive separate estimates of global biospheric and petrogenic POC fluxes of 157(-50)(+74) and 43(-25)(+61) megatonnes of carbon per year, respectively. We find that biospheric POC export is primarily controlled by the capacity of rivers to mobilize and transport POC, and is largely insensitive to the magnitude of terrestrial primary production. Globally, physical erosion rates affect the rate of biospheric POC burial in marine sediments more strongly than carbon sequestration through silicate weathering. We conclude that burial of biospheric POC in marine sediments becomes the dominant long-term atmospheric carbon dioxide sink under enhanced physical erosion.","[Galy, Valier; Peucker-Ehrenbrink, Bernhard; Eglinton, Timothy] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Marine Chem & Geochem, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Eglinton, Timothy] ETH, Inst Geol, Dept Earth Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland","Galy, V (reprint author), Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Marine Chem & Geochem, 360 Woods Hole Rd, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.",vgaly@whoi.edu,"galy, valier/I-6185-2012","Peucker-Ehrenbrink, Bernhard/0000-0002-3819-992X",US National Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-0851015]; NSF [OCE-0928582]; Swiss National Science Foundation [200021_140850],"We thank Y.

This process is largely dependent on microbial responses, but we know little about microbial activity in intact, let alone in thawing, permafrost. Molecular approaches have recently revealed the identities and functional gene composition of microorganismsin some permafrost soils(2-4) and a rapid shift in functional gene composition during short-term thaw experiments(3). However, the fate of permafrost carbon depends on climatic, hydrological and microbial responses to thaw at decadal scales(5,6). Here we use the combination of several molecular 'omics' approaches to determine the phylogenetic composition of the microbial communities, including several draft genomes of novel species, their functional potential and activity in soils representing different states of thaw: intact permafrost, seasonally thawed active layer and thermokarst bog. The multi-omics strategy reveals a good correlation of process rates to omics data for dominant processes, such as methanogenesis in the bog, as well as novel survival strategies for potentially active microbes in permafrost.","[Hultman, Jenni; David, Maude M.; Jansson, Janet K.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Earth Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Waldrop, Mark P.; McFarland, Jack; Blazewicz, Steven J.; Harden, Jennifer] US Geol Survey, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Mackelprang, Rachel] Calif State Univ Northridge, Biol Dept, Northridge, CA 91330 USA; [Mackelprang, Rachel; Mavrommatis, Kostas; Jansson, Janet K.] US DOE, Joint Genome Inst, Walnut Creek, CA 94598 USA; [Turetsky, Merritt R.] Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [McGuire, A.

In plants, however, the molecular mechanisms of how signal perception is transduced to MAPK activation remain elusive(1). Here we report that pathogen-secreted proteases activate a previously unknown signalling pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana involving the G alpha, G beta, and G gamma subunits of heterotrimeric G-protein complexes, which function upstream of an MAPK cascade. In this pathway, receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1) functions as a novel scaffold that binds to the G beta subunit as well as to all three tiers of the MAPK cascade, thereby linking upstream G-protein signalling to downstream activation of an MAPK cascade. The protease-G-protein-RACK1-MAPK cascade modules identified in these studies are distinct from previously described plant immune signalling pathways such as that elicited by bacterial flagellin, in which G proteins function downstream of or in parallel to an MAPK cascade without the involvement of the RACK1 scaffolding protein. The discovery of the new protease-mediated immune signalling pathway described here was facilitated by the use of the broad host range, opportunistic bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The ability of P. aeruginosa to infect both plants and animals makes it an excellent model to identify novel immunoregulatory strategies that account for its niche adaptation to diverse host tissues and immune systems.","[Cheng, Zhenyu; Li, Jian-Feng; Niu, Yajie; Zhang, Xue-Cheng; Xiong, Yan; Djonovic, Slavica; Millet, Yves; Bush, Jenifer; Sheen, Jen; Ausubel, Frederick M.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Mol Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Cheng, Zhenyu; Li, Jian-Feng; Niu, Yajie; Zhang, Xue-Cheng; Xiong, Yan; Djonovic, Slavica; Millet, Yves; Bush, Jenifer; Sheen, Jen; Ausubel, Frederick M.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Woody, Owen Z.; McConkey, Brendan J.] Univ Waterloo, Dept Biol, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada","Ausubel, FM (reprint author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Mol Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",ausubel@molbio.mgh.harvard.edu,,,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Banting Postdoctoral Fellowships; National Science Foundation [MCB-0519898, IOS-0929226, IOS-0618292]; National Institutes of Health [R37-GM48707, P30 DK040561, R01-GM70567]","We thank G.

For example, vision requires the lens to be centred in the eye cup which must in turn be correctly positioned in the head(1). Tissue morphogenesis depends on force generation, force transmission through the tissue, and response of tissues and extracellular matrix to force(2,3). Although a century ago D'Arcy Thompson postulated that terrestrial animal body shapes are conditioned by gravity(4), there has been no animal model directly demonstrating how the aforementioned mechano-morphogenetic processes are coordinated to generate a body shape that withstands gravity. Here we report a unique medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) mutant, hirame (hir), which is sensitive to deformation by gravity. hir embryos display a markedly flattened body caused by mutation of YAP, a nuclear executor of Hippo signalling that regulates organ size. We show that actomyosin-mediated tissue tension is reduced in hir embryos, leading to tissue flattening and tissue misalignment, both of which contribute to body flattening. By analysing YAP function in 3D spheroids of human cells, we identify the Rho GTPase activating protein ARHGAP18 as an effector of YAP in controlling tissue tension. Together, these findings reveal a previously unrecognised function of YAP in regulating tissue shape and alignment required for proper 3D body shape. Understanding this morphogenetic function of YAP could facilitate the use of embryonic stem cells to generate complex organs requiring correct alignment of multiple tissues.","[Porazinski, Sean; Wang, Huijia; Linton, Sarah; Castillo-Morales, Atahualpa; Urrutia, Araxi O.; Bagby, Stefan; Furutani-Seiki, Makoto] Univ Bath, Dept Biol & Biochem, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Asaoka, Yoichi; Hata, Shoji; Asaka, Satoshi; Nishina, Hiroshi] Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Med Res Inst, Dept Dev & Regenerat Biol, Tokyo 1138510, Japan; [Behrndt, Martin; Morita, Hitoshi; Krens, S.

However, the reason why the virus selects only certain genes among all transcriptionally active regions in a target cell remains largely unknown. Here we show that HIV-1 integration occurs in the outer shell of the nucleus in close correspondence with the nuclear pore. This region contains a series of cellular genes, which are preferentially targeted by the virus, and characterized by the presence of active transcription chromatin marks before viral infection. In contrast, the virus strongly disfavours the heterochromatic regions in the nuclear lamin-associated domains(5) and other transcriptionally active regions located centrally in the nucleus. Functional viral integrase and the presence of the cellular Nup153 and LEDGF/p75 integration cofactors are indispensable for the peripheral integration of the virus. Once integrated at the nuclear pore, the HIV-1 DNA makes contact with various nucleoporins; this association takes part in the transcriptional regulation of the viral genome. These results indicate that nuclear topography is an essential determinant of the HIV-1 life cycle.","[Marini, Bruna; Ali, Hashim; Lucic, Bojana; Lisek, Kamil; Manganaro, Lara; Giacca, Mauro; Lusic, Marina] Int Ctr Genet Engn & Biotechnol, Mol Med Lab, I-34149 Trieste, Italy; [Kertesz-Farkas, Attila; Pongor, Sandor] Int Ctr Genet Engn & Biotechnol, Prot Struct & Bioinformat Grp, I-34149 Trieste, Italy; [Luzzati, Roberto] Azienda Osped Univ, Struttura Complessa Malattie Infett, I-34134 Trieste, Italy; [Luzzati, Roberto; Giacca, Mauro] Univ Trieste, Dept Med Surg & Hlth Sci, I-34129 Trieste, Italy; [Recchia, Alessandra; Mavilio, Fulvio] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Life Sci, I-41121 Modena, Italy; [Mavilio, Fulvio] Genethon, F-91002 Evry, France","Giacca, M (reprint author), Int Ctr Genet Engn & Biotechnol, Mol Med Lab, I-34149 Trieste, Italy.",giacca@icgeb.org; marina.lusic@med.uni-heidelberg.de,"Giacca, Mauro/J-9287-2016","Giacca, Mauro/0000-0003-2927-7225; Lisek, Kamil/0000-0002-2406-8830; Manganaro, Lara/0000-0003-2743-2658","Italian National Research Programme on AIDS of the Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Italy; Italian Ministry of Health [RF2007-16]","This work was supported by grants from the Italian National Research Programme on AIDS of the Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Italy, to M.G. and M.L. and from the Young Investigator Grant RF2007-16 of the Italian Ministry of Health to M.L.

One of the best-studied lncRNAs is Xist, which is required for transcriptional silencing of one X chromosome during development in female mammals(3,4). Despite extensive efforts to define the mechanism of Xist-mediated transcriptional silencing, we still do not know any proteins required for this role(3). The main challenge is that there are currently no methods to comprehensively define the proteins that directly interact with a lncRNA in the cell(5). Here we develop a method to purify a lncRNA from cells and identify proteins interacting with it directly using quantitative mass spectrometry. We identify ten proteins that specifically associate with Xist, three of these proteins-SHARP, SAF-A and LBR-are required for Xist-mediated transcriptional silencing. We show that SHARP, which interacts with the SMRT co-repressor(6) that activates HDAC3(7), is not only essential for silencing, but is also required for the exclusion of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) from the inactive X. Both SMRT and HDAC3 are also required for silencing and Pol II exclusion. In addition to silencing transcription, SHARP and HDAC3 are required for Xist-mediated recruitment of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) across the X chromosome. Our results suggest that Xist silences transcription by directly interacting with SHARP, recruiting SMRT, activating HDAC3, and deacetylating histones to exclude Pol II across the X chromosome.","[McHugh, Colleen A.; Chen, Chun-Kan; Chow, Amy; Surka, Christine F.; Tran, Christina; Blanco, Mario; Burghard, Christina; Shishkin, Alexander A.; Su, Julia; Guttman, Mitchell] CALTECH, Div Biol & Biol Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [McDonel, Patrick; Lander, Eric S.] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Pandya-Jones, Amy; Plath, Kathrin] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Mol Biol, Dept Biol Chem, Jonsson Comprehens Canc Ctr, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Pandya-Jones, Amy; Plath, Kathrin] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Eli & Edythe Broad Ctr Regenerat Med & Stem Cell, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Moradian, Annie; Sweredoski, Michael J.; Hess, Sonja] CALTECH, Beckman Inst, Proteome Explorat Lab, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Guttman, M (reprint author), CALTECH, Div Biol & Biol Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",mguttman@caltech.edu,,"Plath, Kathrin/0000-0001-7796-3372","Caltech; NIH NRSA [T32GM07616]; Caltech Beckman Institute; Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation [GBMF775]; Beckman Institute; NIH [1S10RR029591-01A1, DP5OD012190]; Rose Hills Foundation; Edward Mallinckrodt Foundation; Sontag Foundation; Searle Scholars Program; California Institute of Technology","We thank J.

F-type ATP synthases use the energy of a transmembrane electrochemical gradient to generate ATP by rotary catalysis. Protons moving across the membrane drive a rotor ring composed of 8-15 c-subunits(1). A central stalk transmits the rotation of the c-ring to the catalytic F-1 head, where a series of conformational changes results in ATP synthesis(2). A key unresolved question in this fundamental process is how protons pass through the membrane to drive ATP production. Mitochondrial ATP synthases form V-shaped homodimers in cristae membranes(3). Here we report the structure of a native and active mitochondrial ATP synthase dimer, determined by single-particle electron cryomicroscopy at 6.2 angstrom resolution. Our structure shows four long, horizontal membrane-intrinsic alpha-helices in the a-subunit, arranged in two hairpins at an angle of approximately 70 degrees relative to the c-ring helices. It has been proposed that a strictly conserved membrane-embedded arginine in the a-subunit couples proton translocation to c-ring rotation(4). A fit of the conserved carboxy-terminal a-subunit sequence places the conserved arginine next to a proton-binding c-subunit glutamate. The map shows a slanting solvent-accessible channel that extends from the mitochondrial matrix to the conserved arginine. Another hydrophilic cavity on the lumenal membrane surface defines a direct route for the protons to an essential histidine-glutamate pair(5). Our results provide unique new insights into the structure and function of rotary ATP synthases and explain how ATP production is coupled to proton translocation.","[Allegretti, Matteo; Klusch, Niklas; Mills, Deryck J.; Vonck, Janet; Kuehlbrandt, Werner; Davies, Karen M.] Max Planck Inst Biophys, Dept Struct Biol, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany","Kuhlbrandt, W (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Biophys, Dept Struct Biol, Max von Laue Str 3, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany.",werner.kuehlbrandt@biophys.mpg.de; karen.davies@biophys.mpg.de,"Allegretti, Matteo/B-7030-2016","Allegretti, Matteo/0000-0002-9542-7482; Kuhlbrandt, Werner/0000-0002-2013-4810",Max Planck Society; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft Cluster of Excellence Frankfurt 'Macromolecular Complexes',"We thank T.

ATP hydrolysis in the soluble catalytic region of the enzyme is coupled to proton translocation through the membrane-bound region by rotation of a central rotor subcomplex, with peripheral stalks preventing the entire membrane-bound region from turning with the rotor. The eukaryotic V-ATPase is the most complex rotary ATPase: it has three peripheral stalks, a hetero-oligomeric proton-conducting proteolipid ring, several subunits not found in other rotary ATPases, and is regulated by reversible dissociation of its catalytic and proton-conducting regions(1,2). Studies of ATP synthases, V-ATPases, and bacterial/archaeal V/A-ATPases have suggested that flexibility is necessary for the catalytic mechanism of rotary ATPases(3-5), but the structures of different rotational states have never been observed experimentally. Here we use electron cryomicroscopy to obtain structures for three rotational states of the V-ATPase from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The resulting series of structures shows ten proteolipid subunits in the c-ring, setting the ATP: H+ ratio for proton pumping by the V-ATPase at 3: 10, and reveals long and highly tilted transmembrane alpha-helices in the a-subunit that interact with the c-ring. The three different maps reveal the conformational changes that occur to couple rotation in the symmetry-mismatched soluble catalytic region to the membrane-bound proton-translocating region. Almost all of the subunits of the enzyme undergo conformational changes during the transitions between these three rotational states. The structures of these states provide direct evidence that deformation during rotation enables the smooth transmission of power through rotary ATPases.","[Zhao, Jianhua; Benlekbir, Samir; Rubinstein, John L.] Hosp Sick Children, Res Inst, Mol Struct & Funct Program, Toronto, ON M5G 0A4, Canada; [Zhao, Jianhua; Rubinstein, John L.] Univ Toronto, Dept Med Biophys, MaRS Ctr, Toronto, ON M5G 1L7, Canada; [Rubinstein, John L.] Univ Toronto, Dept Biochem, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada","Rubinstein, JL (reprint author), Hosp Sick Children, Res Inst, Mol Struct & Funct Program, 686 Bay St, Toronto, ON M5G 0A4, Canada.",john.rubinstein@utoronto.ca,,"Rubinstein, John/0000-0003-0566-2209; Zhao, Jianhua/0000-0002-4997-766X",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Mary Gertrude l'Anson Scholarship; Canadian Institutes of Health Research [MOP 81294],"We thank P.

Here we utilize CRISPR/Cas9 technology for targeted gene modification of four of the most commonly mutated colorectal cancer genes (APC, P53 (also known as TP53), KRAS and SMAD4) in cultured human intestinal stem cells. Mutant organoids can be selected by removing individual growth factors from the culture medium. Quadruple mutants grow independently of all stem-cell-niche factors and tolerate the presence of the P53 stabilizer nutlin-3. Upon xenotransplantation into mice, quadruple mutants grow as tumours with features of invasive carcinoma. Finally, combined loss of APC and P53 is sufficient for the appearance of extensive aneuploidy, a hallmark of tumour progression.","[Drost, Jarno; van Boxtel, Ruben; Sachs, Norman; Begthel, Harry; Korving, Jeroen; van de Wetering, Marc; Schwank, Gerald; Logtenberg, Meike; Cuppen, Edwin; Clevers, Hans] Royal Netherlands Acad Arts & Sci KNAW, Hubrecht Inst, NL-3584 CT Utrecht, Netherlands; [Drost, Jarno; van Boxtel, Ruben; Sachs, Norman; Begthel, Harry; Korving, Jeroen; van de Wetering, Marc; Schwank, Gerald; Logtenberg, Meike; Cuppen, Edwin; Clevers, Hans] UMC Utrecht, NL-3584 CT Utrecht, Netherlands; [Drost, Jarno; van Jaarsveld, Richard H.; Ponsioen, Bas; Zimberlin, Cheryl; van Boxtel, Ruben; Sachs, Norman; Overmeer, Rene M.; Begthel, Harry; Korving, Jeroen; van de Wetering, Marc; Schwank, Gerald; Logtenberg, Meike; Cuppen, Edwin; Snippert, Hugo J.; Medema, Jan Paul; Kops, Geert J.

Since the positively charged Schiff base proton, located within the ion-conducting pathway of all light-driven ion pumps, was thought to prohibit the transport of a non-proton cation, the discovery of KR2 raised the question of how it achieves Na+ transport. Here we present crystal structures of KR2 under neutral and acidic conditions, which represent the resting and M-like intermediate states, respectively. Structural and spectroscopic analyses revealed the gating mechanism, whereby the flipping of Asp116 sequesters the Schiff base proton from the conducting pathway to facilitate Na+ transport. Together with the structure-based engineering of the first light-driven K1 pumps, electrophysiological assays in mammalian neurons and behavioural assays in a nematode, our studies reveal the molecular basis for light-driven non-proton cation pumps and thus provide a framework that may advance the development of next-generation optogenetics.","[Kato, Hideaki E.; Kunitomo, Hirofumi; Takemoto, Mizuki; Nishizawa, Tomohiro; Taniguchi, Reiya; Iino, Yuichi; Ishitani, Ryuichiro; Nureki, Osamu] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biol Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130032, Japan; [Inoue, Keiichi; Abe-Yoshizumi, Rei; Kato, Yoshitaka; Ono, Hikaru; Konno, Masae; Kandori, Hideki] Nagoya Inst Technol, Dept Frontier Mat, Showa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4668555, Japan; [Inoue, Keiichi; Kandori, Hideki] Nagoya Inst Technol, OptoBioTechnol Res Ctr, Showa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4668555, Japan; [Inoue, Keiichi] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, PRESTO, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; [Hososhima, Shoko; Ishizuka, Toru; Hoque, Mohammad Razuanul; Yawo, Hiromu] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Life Sci, Dept Dev Biol & Neurosci, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan; [Hososhima, Shoko; Ishizuka, Toru; Hoque, Mohammad Razuanul; Iino, Yuichi; Yawo, Hiromu] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, CREST, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; [Ito, Jumpei] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Bioagr Sci, Dept Bioengn Sci, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Yoshizawa, Susumu; Kogure, Kazuhiro] Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778564, Japan; [Yamashita, Keitaro] RIKEN SPring 8 Ctr, Mikazuki, Hyogo 6795148, Japan","Nureki, O (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biol Sci, Bunkyo Ku, 2-11-16 Yayoi, Tokyo 1130032, Japan.",kandori@nitech.ac.jp; nureki@bs.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Yawo, Hiromu/I-4871-2015; IINO, YUICHI/G-4962-2014; Ishizuka, Toru/L-8191-2017","Yawo, Hiromu/0000-0002-4299-3288; Ishizuka, Toru/0000-0003-4405-8792; Ito, Jumpei/0000-0001-5149-9962; Kato, Hideaki/0000-0002-1941-5535; yoshizawa, susumu/0000-0001-9667-6010; Takemoto, Mizuki/0000-0002-6339-6431","Platform for Drug Discovery, Informatics and Structural Life Science, of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT); JSPS KAKENHI [11J06643, 24115508, 24655009, 25104009, 24681003, 24227004, 25291011]; FIRST program, PRESTO, CREST, JST","We thank M.

However, a clump formation event has not yet been observed, and it is debated whether clumps can survive energetic feedback from young stars, and afterwards migrate inwards to form galaxy bulges(9-12). Here we report the spatially resolved spectroscopy of a bright off-nuclear emission line region in a galaxy at z = 1.987. Although this region dominates star formation in the galaxy disk, its stellar continuum remains undetected in deep imaging, revealing an extremely young (less than ten million years old) massive clump, forming through the gravitational collapse of more than one billion solarmasses of gas. Gas consumption in this young clump is more than tenfold faster than in the host galaxy, displaying high star-formation efficiency during this phase, in agreement with our hydrodynamic simulations. The frequency of older clumps with similar masses(13), coupled with our initial estimate of their formation rate (about 2.5 per billion years), supports long lifetimes (about 500 million years), favouring models in which clumps survive feedback and grow the bulges of present-day galaxies.","[Zanella, A.; Daddi, E.; Le Floc'h, E.; Bournaud, F.; Gobat, R.; Valentino, F.; Strazzullo, V.; Cibinel, A.; Renaud, F.] CEA DSM CNRS Univ Paris Diderot, Lab AIM Paris Saclay, Irfu Serv Astrophys, CEA Saclay, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Gobat, R.] Korea Inst Adv Study, Sch Phys, Seoul 130722, South Korea; [Strazzullo, V.] Univ Munich, Dept Phys, D-81679 Munich, Germany; [Cibinel, A.] Univ Sussex, Dept Phys & Astron, Ctr Astron, Brighton BN1 9QH, E Sussex, England; [Onodera, M.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Astron, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Perret, V.] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, LAM, F-13388 Marseille, France; [Renaud, F.] Univ Surrey, Dept Phys, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England; [Vignali, C.] Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Fis & Astron, I-40127 Bologna, Italy; [Vignali, C.] INAF Osservatorio Astron Bologna, I-40127 Bologna, Italy","Zanella, A (reprint author), CEA DSM CNRS Univ Paris Diderot, Lab AIM Paris Saclay, Irfu Serv Astrophys, CEA Saclay, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France.",anita.zanella@cea.fr,"Vignali, Cristian/J-4974-2012; Daddi, Emanuele/D-1649-2012","Vignali, Cristian/0000-0002-8853-9611; Daddi, Emanuele/0000-0002-3331-9590; Cibinel, Anna/0000-0003-4578-514X","Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-12-JS05-0008-01]; European Commission through European Research Council [StG-257720, StG-240039]","We thank S.

These fractures have been shown to be the sources of the observed jets of water vapour and icy particles(1-4) and to exhibit higher temperatures than the surrounding terrain(5,6). Subsequent observations have focused on obtaining close-up imaging of this region to better characterize these emissions. Recent work(7) examined those newer data sets and used triangulation of discrete jets3 to produce maps of jetting activity at various times. Here we show that much of the eruptive activity can be explained by broad, curtain-like eruptions. Optical illusions in the curtain eruptions resulting from a combination of viewing direction and local fracture geometry produce image features that were probably misinterpreted previously as discrete jets. We present maps of the total emission along the fractures, rather than just the jet-like component, for five times during an approximately one-year period in 2009 and 2010.

To provide comparable complexity while operating much faster and with manageable power dissipation, networks(2) based on circuits(3,4) combining complementary metaloxide-semiconductors (CMOSs) and adjustable two-terminal resistive devices (memristors) have been developed. In such circuits, the usual CMOS stack is augmented with one(3) or several(4) crossbar layers, with memristors at each crosspoint. There have recently been notable improvements in the fabrication of such memristive crossbars and their integration with CMOS circuits(5-12), including first demonstrations(5,6,12) of their vertical integration. Separately, discrete memristors have been used as artificial synapses in neuromorphic networks(13-18). Very recently, such experiments have been extended(19) to crossbar arrays of phase-change memristive devices. The adjustment of such devices, however, requires an additional transistor at each crosspoint, and hence these devices are much harder to scale than metal-oxide memristors(11,20,21), whose nonlinear current-voltage curves enable transistor-free operation. Here we report the experimental implementation of transistor-free metal-oxide memristor crossbars, with device variability sufficiently low to allow operation of integrated neural networks, in a simple network: a single-layer perceptron (an algorithm for linear classification). The network can be taught in situ using a coarse-grain variety of the delta rule algorithm(22) to perform the perfect classification of 3 3 3-pixel black/white images into three classes (representing letters). This demonstration is an important step towards much larger and more complex memristive neuromorphic networks.","[Prezioso, M.; Merrikh-Bayat, F.; Hoskins, B. D.; Adam, G. C.; Strukov, D.

Because of their strong vertical and horizontal currents, and the turbulent mixing caused by their breaking, they affect a panoply of ocean processes, such as the supply of nutrients for photosynthesis(1), sediment and pollutant transport(2) and acoustic transmission(3); they also pose hazards for man-made structures in the ocean(4). Generated primarily by the wind and the tides, internal waves can travel thousands of kilometres from their sources before breaking(5), making it challenging to observe them and to include them in numerical climate models, which are sensitive to their effects(6,7). For over a decade, studies(8-11) have targeted the South China Sea, where the oceans' most powerful known internal waves are generated in the Luzon Strait and steepen dramatically as they propagate west. Confusion has persisted regarding their mechanism of generation, variability and energy budget, however, owing to the lack of in situ data from the Luzon Strait, where extreme flow conditions make measurements difficult. Here we use new observations and numerical models to (1) show that the waves begin as sinusoidal disturbances rather than arising from sharp hydraulic phenomena, (2) reveal the existence of >200-metre-high breaking internal waves in the region of generation that give rise to turbulence levels >10,000 times that in the open ocean, (3) determine that the Kuroshio western boundary current noticeably refracts the internal wave field emanating from the Luzon Strait, and (4) demonstrate a factor-of-two agreement between modelled and observed energy fluxes, which allows us to produce an observationally supported energy budget of the region. Together, these findings give a cradle-to-grave picture of internal waves on a basin scale, which will support further improvements of their representation in numerical climate predictions.","[Alford, Matthew H.; MacKinnon, Jennifer A.; Centuroni, Luca R.; Johnston, T.

Furthermore, it has been suggested that bees could choose to forage on other available flowers and hence avoid or dilute exposure(4,5). Here, using a two-choice feeding assay, we show that the honeybee, Apis mellifera, and the buff-tailed bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, do not avoid nectar-relevant concentrations of three of the most commonly used neonicotinoids, imidacloprid (IMD), thiamethoxam (TMX), and clothianidin (CLO), in food. Moreover, bees of both species prefer to eat more of sucrose solutions laced with IMD or TMX than sucrose alone. Stimulation with IMD, TMX and CLO neither elicited spiking responses from gustatory neurons in the bees' mouthparts, nor inhibited the responses of sucrose-sensitive neurons. Our data indicate that bees cannot taste neonicotinoids and are not repelled by them. Instead, bees preferred solutions containing IMD or TMX, even though the consumption of these pesticides caused them to eat less food overall. This work shows that bees cannot control their exposure to neonicotinoids in food and implies that treating flowering crops with IMD and TMX presents a sizeable hazard to foraging bees.","[Kessler, Sebastien C.; Simcock, Kerry L.; Softley, Samantha; Wright, Geraldine A.] Newcastle Univ, Inst Neurosci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 4HH, Tyne & Wear, England; [Tiedeken, Erin Jo; Stout, Jane C.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Bot, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Derveau, Sophie] Newcastle Univ, Sch Biol, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [Mitchell, Jessica] Univ Oxford, Ctr Neural Circuits & Behav, Oxford OX1 3SR, England","Wright, GA (reprint author), Newcastle Univ, Inst Neurosci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 4HH, Tyne & Wear, England.",jeri.wright@ncl.ac.uk,"Stout, Jane /B-1631-2010","Stout, Jane /0000-0002-2027-0863",BBSRC; NERC; Wellcome Trust; Defra; Scottish Government under the Insect Pollinators Initiative [BB/I000143/1]; Leverhulme Trust [RPG-2012-708]; Science Foundation Ireland [10/RFP/EOB2842]; US National Science Foundation [2010097514]; Irish Research Council's EMBARK Postgraduate Scholarship Scheme grant [RS/2010/2147],"We thank M.

Neonicotinoids are suspected to pose an unacceptable risk to bees, partly because of their systemic uptake in plants(5), and the European Union has therefore introduced a moratorium on three neonicotinoids as seed coatings in flowering crops that attract bees(6). The moratorium has been criticized for being based on weak evidence(7), particularly because effects have mostly been measured on bees that have been artificially fed neonicotinoids(8-11). Thus, the key question is how neonicotinoids influence bees, and wild bees in particular, in real-world agricultural landscapes(11-13). Here we show that a commonly used insecticide seed coating in a flowering crop can have serious consequences for wild bees. In a study with replicated and matched landscapes, we found that seed coating with Elado, an insecticide containing a combination of the neonicotinoid clothianidin and the non-systemic pyrethroid beta-cyfluthrin, applied to oilseed rape seeds, reduced wild bee density, solitary bee nesting, and bumblebee colony growth and reproduction under field conditions. Hence, such insecticidal use can pose a substantial risk to wild bees in agricultural landscapes, and the contribution of pesticides to the global decline of wild bees(1-3) may have been underestimated. The lack of a significant response in honeybee colonies suggests that reported pesticide effects on honeybees cannot always be extrapolated to wild bees.","[Rundlof, Maj; Andersson, Georg K.

Multiple mechanisms have been suggested to underlie this(2,6-10), but the actual cause is unknown. Here we identify variable DNA mismatch repair (MMR) as the basis of this variation. Analysing similar to 17 million single-nucleotide variants from the genomes of 652 tumours, we show that regional autosomal mutation rates at megabase resolution are largely stable across cancer types, with differences related to changes in replication timing and gene expression. However, mutations arising after the inactivation of MMR are no longer enriched in late replicating heterochromatin relative to early replicating euchromatin. Thus, differential DNA repair and not differential mutation supply is the primary cause of the large-scale regional mutation rate variation across the human genome.","[Supek, Fran; Lehner, Ben] CRG, EMBL CRG Syst Biol Unit, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Supek, Fran; Lehner, Ben] UPF, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Supek, Fran] Rudjer Boskovic Inst, Div Elect, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Lehner, Ben] ICREA, Barcelona 08010, Spain","Lehner, B (reprint author), CRG, EMBL CRG Syst Biol Unit, Barcelona 08003, Spain.",ben.lehner@crg.eu,"Lehner, Ben/L-3413-2014; Supek, Fran/B-2359-2012","Lehner, Ben/0000-0002-8817-1124; Supek, Fran/0000-0002-7811-6711",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [BFU2011-26206]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (Centro de Excelencia Severo Ochoa) [SEV-2012-0208]; European Research Council Consolidator grant IR-DC [616434]; Agencia de Gestio d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca (AGAUR); EMBO Young Investigator Program; EMBL-CRG Systems Biology Program; FP7 project 4DCellFate [277899]; FP7 project MAESTRA [ICT-2013-612944]; Marie Curie Actions; ICREA,"This work was supported by grants from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (BFU2011-26206 and 'Centro de Excelencia Severo Ochoa 2013-2017' SEV-2012-0208), a European Research Council Consolidator grant IR-DC (616434), Agencia de Gestio d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca (AGAUR), the EMBO Young Investigator Program, the EMBL-CRG Systems Biology Program, FP7 project 4DCellFate (277899), FP7 project MAESTRA (ICT-2013-612944) and by Marie Curie Actions.",,40,61,61,6,52,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,7-May,2015,521,7550,,,,,81,U173,,10.1038/nature14173,,11,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,CH4YS,WOS:000354040900037,25707793,No,,,11/20/17

Current models postulate that the basal ganglia modulate cerebral cortex indirectly via an inhibitory output to thalamus, bidirectionally controlled by direct-and indirect-pathway striatal projection neurons (dSPNs and iSPNs, respectively)(2-4). The basal ganglia thalamic output sculpts cortical activity by interacting with signals from sensory and motor systems(5). Here we describe a direct projection from the globus pallidus externus (GP), a central nucleus of the basal ganglia, to frontal regions of the cerebral cortex (FC). Two cell types make up the GP-FC projection, distinguished by their electrophysiological properties, cortical projections and expression of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), a synthetic enzyme for the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh). Despite these differences, ChAT(+) cells, which have been historically identified as an extension of the nucleus basalis, as well asChAT(-) cells, release the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA (c-aminobutyric acid) and are inhibited by iSPNs and dSPNs of dorsal striatum. Thus, GP-FC cells comprise a direct GABAergic/cholinergic projection under the control of striatum that activates frontal cortex in vivo. Furthermore, iSPN inhibition of GP-FC cells is sensitive to dopamine 2 receptor signalling, revealing a pathway by which drugs that target dopamine receptors for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders can act in the basal ganglia to modulate frontal cortices.","[Saunders, Arpiar; Oldenburg, Ian A.; Berezovskii, Vladimir K.; Johnson, Caroline A.; Sabatini, Bernardo L.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Kingery, Nathan D.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Neurobiol Imaging Facil, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Elliott, Hunter L.; Xie, Tiao] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Image & Data Anal Core, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Gerfen, Charles R.] NIMH, Lab Syst Neurosci, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Sabatini, BL (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Neurobiol, 220 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",bsabatini@hms.harvard.edu,,"Berezovskii, Vladimir/0000-0003-4077-3940","National Institutes of Health [F31 NS074842, F31-MH093026-01A1, P30 EY12196]; NINDS P30 Core Center grant [NS072030]; NIH [R01 NS046579]","The authors thank the Lowell laboratory at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for the gift of the DIO-synaptophysin-mCherry and DIO-synaptophysin-GFP rAAVs, R.

In many cases, the microbiota is the presumed cause of the variation. Current solutions to account for phenotypic variability include littermate and maternal controls or defined microbial consortia ingnotobiotic mice(6,7). Inconventionally raised mice, the microbiome is transmitted from the dam(2,8,9). Here we show that microbially driven dichotomous faecal immunoglobulin-A (IgA) levels in wild-type mice within the same facility mimic the effects of chromosomal mutations. We observe in multiple facilities that vertically transmissible bacteria in IgA-low mice dominantly lower faecal IgA levels in IgA-high mice after co-housing or faecal transplantation. In response to injury, IgA-low mice show increased damage that is transferable by faecal transplantation and driven by faecal IgA differences. We find that bacteria from IgA-low mice degrade the secretory component of secretory IgA as well as IgA itself. These data indicate that phenotypic comparisons between mice must take into account the non-chromosomal hereditary variation between different breeders. We propose faecal IgA as one marker of microbial variability and conclude that co-housing and/or faecal transplantation enables analysis of progeny from different dams.","[Moon, Clara; Baldridge, Megan T.; Wallace, Meghan A.; Burnham, Carey-Ann D.; Virgin, Herbert W.; Stappenbeck, Thaddeus S.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Immunol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA","Virgin, HW (reprint author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Immunol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.",virgin@wustl.edu; stappenb@pathology.wustl.edu,,"Baldridge, Megan/0000-0002-7030-6131","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [AI08488702, DK7161907]; Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America Genetics Initiative; Rainin Foundation; Helmsley Charitable Trust; NIH [T32AI007163, T32CA009547, P30AR048335, P30DK052574]; W.M.

Recently developed therapeutics that overcome tolerogenic mechanisms activate tumour-directed CTLs and are effective in some human cancers(1). Immune mechanisms also affect treatment outcome, and certain chemotherapeutic drugs stimulate cancer-specific immune responses by inducing immunogenic cell death and other effector mechanisms(3,4). Our previous studies revealed that B cells recruited by the chemokine CXCL13 into prostate cancer tumours promote the progression of castrate-resistant prostate cancer by producing lymphotoxin, which activates an IkB kinase a (IKK alpha)-BMI1 module in prostate cancer stem cells(5,6). Because castrate-resistant prostate cancer is refractory to most therapies, we examined B cell involvement in the acquisition of chemotherapy resistance. Here we focus on oxaliplatin, an immunogenic chemotherapeutic agent(3,4) that is effective in aggressive prostate cancer(7). We show that mouse B cells modulate the response to low-dose oxaliplatin, which promotes tumour-directed CTL activation by inducing immunogenic cell death. Three different mouse prostate cancer models were refractory to oxaliplatin unless genetically or pharmacologically depleted of B cells. The crucial immunosuppressive B cells are plasmocytes that express IgA, interleukin (IL)-10 and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), the appearance of which depends on TGF beta receptor signalling. Elimination of these cells, which also infiltrate human-therapy-resistant prostate cancer, allows CTL-dependent eradication of oxaliplatin-treated tumours.","[Shalapour, Shabnam; Font-Burgada, Joan; Di Caro, Giuseppe; Zhong, Zhenyu; Sanchez-Lopez, Elsa; Dhar, Debanjan; Ammirante, Massimo; Strasner, Amy; Karin, Michael] UCSD, Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol, Lab Gene Regulat & Signal Transduct, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Shalapour, Shabnam; Font-Burgada, Joan; Di Caro, Giuseppe; Zhong, Zhenyu; Sanchez-Lopez, Elsa; Dhar, Debanjan; Ammirante, Massimo; Strasner, Amy; Hansel, Donna E.; Karin, Michael] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Willimsky, Gerald] Charite Campus Buch, Inst Immunol, D-13125 Berlin, Germany; [Jamieson, Christina; Kane, Christopher J.] Univ Calif San Diego, Div Urol, Dept Surg, San Diego, CA 92093 USA; [Klatte, Tobias] Med Univ Vienna, Dept Urol, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Birner, Peter; Kenner, Lukas] Med Univ Vienna, Dept Pathol, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Kenner, Lukas] Univ Vet Med Vienna, Med Univ Vienna, Ludwig Boltzmann Inst Canc Res, Clin Inst Pathol,UPLA, A-1210 Vienna, Austria","Karin, M (reprint author), UCSD, Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol, Lab Gene Regulat & Signal Transduct, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",karinoffice@ucsd.edu,"Dhar, Debanjan/P-3072-2015; Sanchez-Lopez, Elsa/A-7131-2017; Zhong, Zhenyu/A-8339-2017","Sanchez-Lopez, Elsa/0000-0002-4236-1985; Kenner, Lukas/0000-0003-2184-1338","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [CA127923, AI043477]; DFG; German Cancer Consortium [TR36, DKTK]; Genome Research-Austria project 'Inflammobiota' (FWF) [P26011]; Cure Search Foundation; German Research Foundation (DFG) [SH721/1-1]; Irvington-CRI; CIRM [TG2-01154]; FIRC/AIRC","We thank L.

Much like transplanted allogeneic organs, allogeneic tumours are reliably rejected by host T cells, even when the tumour and host share the same major histocompatibility complex alleles, the most potent determinants of transplant rejection(6-10). How such tumour-eradicating immunity is initiated remains unknown, although elucidating this process could provide the basis for inducing similar responses against naturally arising tumours. Here we find that allogeneic tumour rejection is initiated in mice by naturally occurring tumour-binding IgG antibodies, which enable dendritic cells (DCs) to internalize tumour antigens and subsequently activate tumour-reactive T cells. We exploited this mechanism to treat autologous and autochthonous tumours successfully. Either systemic administration of DCs loaded with allogeneic-IgG-coated tumour cells or intratumoral injection of allogeneic IgG in combination with DC stimuli induced potent T-cell-mediated antitumour immune responses, resulting in tumour eradication in mouse models of melanoma, pancreas, lung and breast cancer. Moreover, this strategy led to eradication of distant tumours and metastases, as well as the injected primary tumours. To assess the clinical relevance of these findings, we studied antibodies and cells from patients with lung cancer. T cells from these patients responded vigorously to autologous tumour antigens after culture with allogeneic-IgG-loaded DCs, recapitulating our findings in mice.

The multiple interactions between catalytic domains within the NRPS machinery are further complemented by additional interactions with external enzymes, particularly focused on the final peptide maturation process. An important class of NRPS metabolites that require extensive external modification of the NRPS-bound peptide are the glycopeptide antibiotics (GPAs), which include vancomycin and teicoplanin(2,3). These clinically relevant peptide antibiotics undergo cytochrome P450-catalysed oxidative crosslinking of aromatic side chains to achieve their final, active conformation(4-12). However, the mechanism underlying the recruitment of the cytochrome P450 oxygenases to the NRPS-bound peptide was previously unknown. Here we show, through in vitro studies, that the X-domain(13,14), a conserved domain of unknown function present in the final module of all GPA NRPS machineries, is responsible for the recruitment of oxygenases to theN RPS-bound peptide to perform the essential side-chain crosslinking. X-ray crystallography shows that the X-domain is structurally related to condensation domains, but that its amino acid substitutions render it catalytically inactive. We found that the X-domain recruits cytochrome P450 oxygenases to the NRPS and determined the interface by solving the structure of a P450-X-domain complex. Additionally, we demonstrated that the modification of peptide precursors by oxygenases in vitro-in particular the installation of the second crosslink in GPA biosynthesis-occurs only in the presence of the X-domain. Our results indicate that the presentation of peptidyl carrier protein (PCP)-bound substrates for oxidation in GPA biosynthesis requires the presence of the NRPS X-domain to ensure conversion of the precursor peptide into a mature aglycone, and that the carrier protein domain alone is not always sufficient to generate a competent substrate for external cytochrome P450 oxygenases.","[Haslinger, Kristina; Peschke, Madeleine; Brieke, Clara; Maximowitsch, Egle; Cryle, Max J.] Max Planck Inst Med Res, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany","Cryle, MJ (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Med Res, Jahnstr 29, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.",Max.Cryle@mpimf-heidelberg.mpg.de,"Cryle, Max/H-7656-2017","Cryle, Max/0000-0002-9739-6157; Haslinger, Kristina/0000-0003-1361-1508",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (Emmy-Noether Program) [CR 392/1-1],"The authors thank A.

Combining information from several modalities is essential for the selection of appropriate actions. Key to understanding multimodal computations is determining the structural patterns of multimodal convergence and how these patterns contribute to behaviour. Modalities could converge early, late or at multiple levels in the sensory processing hierarchy. Here we show that combining rnechanosensory and nociceptive cues synergistically enhances the selection of the fastest mode of escape locomotion in Drosophila larvae. In an electron microscopy volume that spans the entire insect nervous system, we reconstructed the multisensory circuit supporting the synergy, spanning multiple levels of the sensory processing hierarchy. The wiring diagram revealed a complex multilevel rnultimorlal convergence architecture. Using behavioural and physiological studies, we identified functionally connected circuit nodes that trigger the fastest locomotor mode, and others that facilitate it, and we provide evidence that multiple levels of multimodal integration contribute to escape mode selection. We propose that the multilevel rnultimoclal convergence architecture may be a general feature of multisensory circuits enabling complex input-output functions and selective tuning to ecologically relevant combinations of cues.","[Ohyama, Tomoko; Schneider-Mizell, Casey M.; Fetter, Richard D.; Aleman, Javier Valdes; Franconville, Romain; Rivera-Alba, Marta; Mensh, Brett D.; Branson, Kristin M.; Simpson, Julie H.; Truman, James W.; Cardona, Albert; Zlatic, Marta] Howard Hughes Med Inst Janelia Res Campus, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA","Cardona, A (reprint author), Howard Hughes Med Inst Janelia Res Campus, 19700 Helix Dr, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA.",cardonaa@hhmi.org; zlaticm@hhmi.org,,"Rivera-Alba, Marta/0000-0002-8069-385X; Ohyama, Tomoko/0000-0003-1697-1138; Simpson, Julie/0000-0002-6793-7100; Cardona, Albert/0000-0003-4941-6536; Schneider-Mizell, Casey/0000-0001-9477-3853; Franconville, Romain/0000-0002-4440-7297",Janelia HHMI; Institute of Neuroinformatics of the University of Zurich; ETH Zurich; SNSF [31003A_132969]; Universitat Zurich Forschungskredit; HHMI Visiting Scientist program at Janelia,"We thank G.

Previous studies suggest that the population of objects emitting soft X-rays (less than 10 kiloelectronvolts) within the surrounding hundreds of parsecs, as well as the population responsible for unresolved X-ray emission extending along the Galactic plane, is dominated by accreting white dwarf systems'. Observations of diffuse hardX-ray (more than 10 kiloelectronvolts) emission in the inner 10 parsecs, however, have been hampered by the limited spatial resolution of previous instruments. Here we report the presence of a distinct hard-X-ray component within the central 4 X 8 parsecs, as revealed by subarcminute-resolution images in the 20-40 kiloelectronvolt range. This emission is more sharply peaked towards the Galactic Centre than is the surface brightness of the soft-X-ray population'. This could indicate a significantly more massive population of accreting white dwarfs, large populations of lowmass X-ray binaries or millisecond pulsars, or particle outflows interacting with the surrounding radiation field, dense molecular material or magnetic fields. However, all these interpretations pose significant challenges to our understanding of stellar evolution, binary formation, and cosmic-ray production in the Galactic Centre.","[Perez, Kerstin; Hailey, Charles J.; Mori, Kaya; Nynka, Melania; Zhang, Shuo] Columbia Univ, Columbia Astrophys Lab, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Perez, Kerstin] Haverford Coll, Haverford, PA 19041 USA; [Bauer, Franz E.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Fis, Inst Astrofis, Santiago 22, Chile; [Bauer, Franz E.] Millennium Inst Astrophys, Santiago 7820436, Chile; [Bauer, Franz E.] Space Sci Inst, Boulder, CO 80301 USA; [Krivonos, Roman A.; Barriere, Nicolas M.; Boggs, Steven E.; Craig, William W.; Tomsick, John A.; Zoglauer, Andreas] Univ Calif Berkeley, Space Sci Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Baganoff, Frederick K.] MIT, Kavli Inst Astrophys & Space Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Christensen, Finn E.] Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Space Inst, DTU Space, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Craig, William W.] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Livermore, CA 94551 USA; [Grefenstette, Brian W.; Harrison, Fiona A.; Madsen, Kristin K.] CALTECH, Cahill Ctr Astron & Astrophys, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Grindlay, Jonathan E.; Hong, Jaesub] Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Stern, Daniel] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA; [Wik, Daniel R.; Zhang, William W.] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA","Perez, K (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Columbia Astrophys Lab, 550 West 120th St,Room 1027, New York, NY 10027 USA.",kperez1@haverford.edu,"Boggs, Steven/E-4170-2015","Boggs, Steven/0000-0001-9567-4224; Krivonos, Roman/0000-0003-2737-5673; Bauer, Franz Erik/0000-0002-8686-8737; Madsen, Kristin/0000-0003-1252-4891","NASA [NNG08FD60C]; Basal-CATA [PFB-06/2007]; CONICYT-Chile [FONDECYT 1141218, EMBIGGEN Anillo ACT1101]; Iniciativa Cientifica Milenio del Ministerio de Economia, Fomento y Turismo [IC120009]","This work was supported by NASA contract no.

They are grown with a newly developed, metal-organic chemical vapour deposition technique, and show high electrical performance, including an electron mobility of 30 cm(2) V-1 s(1) at room temperature and 114 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) at 90K for Mo52, with little dependence on position or channel length. With the use of these films we successfully demonstrate the wafer-scale batch fabrication of highperformance monolayer Mo52 field-effect transistors with a 99% device yield and the multi-level fabrication of vertically stacked transistor devices for three-dimensional circuitry. Our work is a step towards the realization of atomically thin integrated circuitry.","[Kang, Kibum; Huang, Lujie; Kim, Cheol-Joo; Park, Jiwoong] Cornell Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Xie, Saien; Han, Yimo; Huang, Pinshane Y.; Muller, David] Cornell Univ, Sch Appl & Engn Phys, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Mak, Kin Fai; Muller, David; Park, Jiwoong] Kavli Inst Cornell Nanoscale Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Mak, Kin Fai] Cornell Univ, Lab Atom & Solid State Phys, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Park, J (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",jpark@cornell.edu,,"Kim, Cheol-Joo/0000-0002-4312-3866; Huang, Pinshane/0000-0002-1095-1833; Kang, Kibum/0000-0003-1674-1826","AFOSR [FA2386-13-1-4118, FA9550-11-1-0033]; Nano Material Technology Development Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT, and Future Planning [2012M3A7B4049887]; National Science Foundation (NSF) through the Cornell Center for Materials Research [NSF DMR-1120296]; Samsung Advanced Institute for Technology GRO Program; National Science Foundation [ECS-0335765]","We thank P.

Ice cores show that Antarctica cooled during the warm phases of the Greenland Dansgaard-Oeschger cycle and vice versa''', suggesting an interhemispheric redistribution of heat through a mechanism called the bipolar seesaw(4-6). Variations in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) strength are thought to have been important, but much uncertainty remains regarding the dynamics and trigger of these abrupt events'. Key information is contained in the relative phasing of hemispheric climate variations, yet the large, poorly constrained difference between gas age and ice age and the relatively low resolution of methane records from Antarctic ice cores have so far precluded methane-based synchronization at the required sub-centennial precision''''"". Here we use a recently drilled high-accumulation Antarctic ice core to show that, on average, abrupt Greenland warming leads the corresponding Antarctic cooling onset by 218 +/- 92 years (2 sigma a) for DansgaardOeschger events, including the Bolling event; Greenland cooling leads the corresponding onset of Antarctic warming by 208 +/- 96 years. Our results demonstrate a north-to-south directionality of the abrupt climatic signal, which is propagated to the Southern Hemisphere high latitudes by oceanic rather than atmospheric processes. The similar interpolar phasing of warming and cooling transitions suggests that the transfer time of the climatic signal is independent of the AMOC background state. Our findings confirm a central role for ocean circulation in the bipolar seesaw and provide clear criteria for assessing hypotheses and model simulations of Dansgaard-Oeschger dynamics.","[Buizert, Christo; Bauska, Thomas K.; Brook, Edward J.; Edwards, Jon S.; Kalk, Michael L.; Lee, James E.; Marcott, Shaun A.; Mitchell, Logan E.; Rhodes, Rachael H.; Rosen, Julia L.] Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Adrian, Betty; Bencivengo, Brian B.; Hargreaves, Geoffrey M.; Nunn, Richard M.] US Geol Survey, Natl Ice Core Lab, Denver, CO 80225 USA; [Ahn, Jinho] Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Seoul 151742, South Korea; [Albert, Mary; Gregory, Stephanie] Dartmouth Coll, Thayer Sch Engn, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Alley, Richard B.; Fegyveresi, John M.; Sowers, Todd A.; Voigt, Donald E.] Penn State Univ, Dept Geosci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Baggenstos, Daniel; Orsi, Anais J.; Severinghaus, Jeffrey P.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Bay, Ryan C.; Price, P.

Abiotic processes including hydrothermal reduction', photochemical reactions', or lightning disc(h)arge' could have converted atmospheric Ny into assimilable NH4, HCN, or NO species, collectively termed fixed nitrogen. But these sources may have been small on the early Earth, severely limiting the size of the primordial biosphere'. The evolution of the nitrogenfixing enzyme nitrogenase, which reduces atmospheric Ny to organic NH4, thus represented a major breakthrough in the radiation of life, but its timing is uncertain'''. Here we present nitrogen isotope ratios with a mean of 0.0 1.2%0 from marine and fluvial sedimentary rocks of prehnite-pumpellyite to greenschist metamorphic grade between 3.2 and 2.75 billion years ago. These data cannot readily be explained by abiotic processes and therefore suggest biological nitrogen fixation, most probably using molybdenum-based nitrogenase as opposed to other variants that impart significant negative fractionations'. Our data place a minimum age constraint of 3.2 billion years on the origin of biological nitrogen fixation and suggest that molybdenum was bioavailable in the mid-Archaean ocean long before the Great Oxidation Event.","[Stueeken, Eva E.; Buick, Roger; Koehler, Matthew C.] Univ Washington, Dept Earth & Space Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Stueeken, Eva E.; Buick, Roger; Koehler, Matthew C.] Univ Washington, Astrobiol Program, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Guy, Bradley M.] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Geol, ZA-2006 Auckland Pk, South Africa","Stueken, EE (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Earth & Space Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",evast@uw.edu,,"Buick, Roger/0000-0003-0139-1659; Stueeken, Eva/0000-0001-6861-2490",Virtual Planetary Laboratory at the University of Washington; Geological Society of America; Agouron Institute,"This work was funded by the Virtual Planetary Laboratory at the University of Washington, a Geological Society of America graduate student research grant to E.E.S., and by an Agouron Institute grant to R.B.

We therefore surveyed epigenetic associations between serum IgE concentrations and methylation at loci concentrated in CpG islands genome wide in 95 nuclear pedigrees, using DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes. We validated positive results in additional families and in subjects from the general population. Here we show replicated associations with a meta-analysis false discovery rate less than 10-4 between IgE and low methylation at 36 loci. Genes annotated to these loci encode known eosinophil products, and also implicate phospholipid inflammatory mediators, specific transcription factors and mitochondrial proteins. We confirmed that methylation at these loci differed significantly in isolated eosinophils from subjects with and without asthma and high IgE levels. The top three loci accounted for 13% of IgE variation in the primary subject panel, explaining the tenfold higher variance found compared with that derived from large single-nucleotide polymorphism genome-wide association studies'''.

Different populations of BLA neurons may encode fearful or rewarding associations'', but the identifying features of these populations and the synaptic mechanisms of differentiating positive and negative emotional valence have remained unknown. Here we show that BLA neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens (NAc projectors) or the centromedial amygdala (CeM projectors) undergo opposing synaptic changes following fear or reward conditioning. We find that photostimulation of NAc projectors supports positive reinforcement while photostimulation of CeM projectors mediates negative reinforcement. Photoinhibition of CeM projectors impairs fear conditioning and enhances reward conditioning. We characterize these functionally distinct neuronal populations by comparing their electrophysiological, morphological and genetic features. Overall, we provide a mechanistic explanation for the representation of positive and negative associations within the amygdala.","[Namburi, Praneeth; Beyeler, Anna; Calhoon, Gwendolyn G.; Halbert, Sarah A.; Wichmann, Romy; Holden, Stephanie S.; Mertens, Kim L.; Anahtar, Melodi; Felix-Ortiz, Ada C.; Tye, Kay M.] MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Picower Inst Learning & Memory, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Namburi, Praneeth; Felix-Ortiz, Ada C.] MIT, Neurosci Grad Program, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Yorozu, Suzuko; Gray, Jesse M.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Halbert, Sarah A.] Wellesley Coll, Undergrad Program Neurosci, Wellesley, MA 02481 USA; [Holden, Stephanie S.; Anahtar, Melodi] MIT, Undergrad Program Neurosci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Mertens, Kim L.] Univ Amsterdam, Masters Program Biomed Sci, NL-1098 XH Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Wickersham, Ian R.] MIT, McGovern Inst Brain Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Tye, KM (reprint author), MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Picower Inst Learning & Memory, E25-618, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",kaytye@mit.edu,,,"NIMH [R01-MH102441-01, R01-MH101528-01]; NIDDK [DP2-DK-102256-01]; JPB Foundation (PIIF); JPB Foundation (PNDRF); NARSAD Foundation; Klingenstein Foundation; Whitehall Foundation; Sloan Foundation; Singleton fellowship; Leventhal fellowship; Whitaker fellowship; Swiss National Science Foundation; Simons Center for the Social Brain; Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) RUBICON fellowship program; McGovern Institute for Brain Research; Picower Institute for Learning and Memory; MIT Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences; BRAIN Initiative award from NIMH [U01-MH106018, U01-N5090473]; BRAIN Initiative award from NINDS [U01-MH106018, U01-N5090473]; NSF [IOS-1451202]; BRAIN Initiative award from NEI [U01-MH106018, U01-N5090473]","We thank C.

In virusplant interactions, one of the major mechanisms for plant antiviral immunity relies on RNA silencing, which is often suppressed by co-evolving virus suppressors, thus enhancing viral pathogenicity in susceptible hosts'. In addition, plants use the nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) domain-containing resistance proteins, which recognize viral effectors to activate effector-triggered immunity in a defence mechanism similar to that employed in nonviral infections'''. Unlike most eukaryotic organisms, plants are not known to activate mechanisms of host global translation suppression to fight viruses'''. Here we demonstrate in Arabidopsis that the constitutive activation of NIK1, a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) identified as a virulence target of the begomovirus nuclear shuttle protein (NSP)(4-6), leads to global translation suppression and translocation of the downstream component RPL 10 to the nucleus, where it interacts with a newly identified MYB-like protein, Lb-INTERACTING MYB DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN (LIMYB), to downregulate translational machinery genes fully. LIMYB overexpression represses ribosomal protein genes at the transcriptional level, resulting in protein synthesis inhibition, decreased viral messenger RNA association with polysome fractions and enhanced tolerance to begomovirus. By contrast, the loss of LIMYB function releases the repression of translation-related genes and increases susceptibility to virus infection. Therefore, LIMYB links immune receptor LRR-RLK activation to global translation suppression as an antiviral immunity strategy in plants.","[Zorzatto, Cristiane; Machado, Joao Paulo B.; Lopes, Kenia V.

Emergence and spread of resistance to them' raises risk of wiping out recent gains achieved in reducing worldwide malaria burden and threatens future malaria control and elimination on a global level. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed parasite genetic loci associated with artemisinin resistance'''. However, there is no consensus on biochemical targets of artemisinin. Whether and how these targets interact with genes identified by GWAS, remains unknown. Here we provide biochemical and cellular evidence that artemisinins are potent inhibitors of Plasmodium falciparum phosphatidylinosito1-3-kinase (PfPI3K), revealing an unexpected mechanism of action. In resistant clinical strains, increased PfPI3K was associated with the C580Y mutation in P. falciparum Kelch13 (PfKelch13), a primary marker of artemisinin resistance. Polyubiquitination of PfPI3K and its binding to PfKelch13 were reduced by the PfKelch13 mutation, which limited proteolysis of PfPI3K and thus increased levels of the kinase, as well as its lipid product phosphatidylinosito1-3-phosphate (PI3P). We find PI3P levels to be predictive of artemisinin resistance in both clinical and engineered laboratory parasites as well as across non-isogenic strains. Elevated PI3P induced artemisinin resistance in absence of PfKelch13 mutations, but remained responsive to regulation by PfKelch13. Evidence is presented for PI3P-dependent signalling in which transgenic expression of an additional kinase confers resistance. Together these data present PI3P as the key mediator of artemisinin resistance and the sole PfPI3K as an important target for malaria elimination.","[Mbengue, Alassane; Bhattacharjee, Souvik; Pandharkar, Trupti; Liu, Haining; Estiu, Guillermina; Stahelin, Robert V.; Rizk, Shahir S.; Njimoh, Dieudonne L.; Ryan, Yana; Wiest, Olaf; Haldar, Kasturi] Univ Notre Dame, Boler Parseghian Ctr Rare & Neglected Dis, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Mbengue, Alassane; Bhattacharjee, Souvik; Pandharkar, Trupti; Rizk, Shahir S.; Njimoh, Dieudonne L.; Ryan, Yana; Pfrender, Michael; Haldar, Kasturi] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Liu, Haining; Estiu, Guillermina; Stahelin, Robert V.; Wiest, Olaf] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Chem & Biochem, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Stahelin, Robert V.] Indiana Univ Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, South Bend, IN 46617 USA; [Njimoh, Dieudonne L.] Univ Buea, Fac Sci, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Buea, Southwest Regio, Cameroon; [Chotivanich, Kesinee; Dondorp, Arjen M.] Mahidol Univ, Fac Trop Med, Bangkok 10400, Thailand; [Nguon, Chea] Natl Ctr Parasitol Entomol & Malaria Control, Phnom Penh 12302, Cambodia; [Ghorbal, Mehdi; Lopez-Rubio, Jose-Juan] Univ Montpellier 1&2 MiVEGEC, CNRS 5290, IRD 224, Montpellier, France; [Emrich, Scott] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Mohandas, Narla] New York Blood Ctr, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Dondorp, Arjen M.] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Clin Med, Ctr Trop Med, Oxford OX3 7BN, England; [Wiest, Olaf] Peking Univ, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Lab Chem Genom, Lab Computat Chem & Drug Design, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China","Haldar, K (reprint author), Univ Notre Dame, Boler Parseghian Ctr Rare & Neglected Dis, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",khaldar@nd.edu,"Lopez-Rubio, Jose-Juan/A-4509-2014","Lopez-Rubio, Jose-Juan/0000-0002-0555-1122; Ghorbal, Mehdi/0000-0002-8896-2786","NIH [HL069630, AI039071, HL078826, AI081077, DK26263]; Notre Dame International","This work was supported by NIH grants HL069630, AI039071, HL078826 (K.H.); AI081077 (R.V.S.); DK26263 (N.M.) and a grant from Notre Dame International.

Some members of the genus, including Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV), can cause lethal haemorrhagic fever in humans. During 2014 an unprecedented ZEBOV outbreak occurred in West Africa and is still ongoing, resulting in over 10,000 deaths, and causing global concern of uncontrolled disease. To meet this challenge a rapid-acting vaccine is needed. Many vaccine approaches have shown promise in being able to protect nonhuman primates against ZEBOV2. In response to the current ZEBOV outbreak several of these vaccines have been fast tracked for human use. However, it is not known whether any of these vaccines can provide protection against the new outbreak Makona strain of ZEBOV. One of these approaches is a first-generation recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV)-based vaccine expressing the ZEBOV glycoprotein (GP) (rVSV/ZEBOV). To address safety concerns associated with this vector, we developed two candidate, further-attenuated rVSV/ZEBOV vaccines. Both attenuated vaccines produced an approximately tenfold lower vaccine-associated viraemia compared to the first-generation vaccine and both provided complete, single-dose protection of macaques from lethal challenge with the Makona outbreak strain of ZEBOV.","[Mire, Chad E.; Geisbert, Joan B.; Agans, Krystle N.; Fenton, Karla A.; Geisbert, Thomas W.] Univ Texas Med Branch, Galveston Natl Lab, Galveston, TX 77555 USA; [Mire, Chad E.; Geisbert, Joan B.; Agans, Krystle N.; Fenton, Karla A.; Geisbert, Thomas W.] Univ Texas Med Branch, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Galveston, TX 77555 USA; [Matassov, Demetrius; Latham, Theresa E.; Clarke, David K.; Eldridge, John H.] Profectus BioSci Inc, Dept Virol & Vaccine Vectors, Tarrytown, NY 10591 USA; [Xu, Rong; Ota-Setlik, Ayuko; Egan, Michael A.; Eldridge, John H.] Profectus BioSci Inc, Dept Immunol, Tarrytown, NY 10591 USA","Geisbert, TW (reprint author), Univ Texas Med Branch, Galveston Natl Lab, Galveston, TX 77555 USA.",twgeisbe@utmb.edu,,,"Department of Microbiology and Immunology at UTMB; Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health [R01AI09881701]","We thank V.

Their systematic targeting by vaccine approaches, however, has been hampered by the fact that every patient's tumour possesses a unique set of mutations (the mutanome') that must first be identified. Recently, we proposed a personalized immunotherapy approach to target the full spectrum of a patient's individual tumour-specific mutationsl. Here we show in three independent murine tumour models that a considerable fraction of non-synonymous cancer mutations is immunogenic and that, unexpectedly, the majority of the immunogenic mutanome is recognized by Cal+ T cells. Vaccination with such Cal+ immunogenic mutations confers strong antitumour activity. Encouraged by these findings, we established a process by which mutations identified by exome sequencing could be selected as vaccine targets solely through bioinformatic prioritization on the basis of their expression levels and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-binding capacity for rapid production as synthetic poly-neo-epitope messenger RNA vaccines. We show that vaccination with such polytope mRNA vaccines induces potent tumour control and complete rejection of established aggressively growing tumours in mice. Moreover, we demonstrate that Cal+ T cell neo-epitope vaccination reshapes the tumour microenvironment and induces cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses against an independent immunodominant antigen in mice, indicating orchestration of antigen spread. Finally, we demonstrate an abundance of mutations predicted to bind to MHC class II in human cancers as well by employing the same predictive algorithm on corresponding human cancer types. Thus, the tailored immunotherapy approach introduced here may be regarded as a universally applicable blueprint for comprehensive exploitation of the substantial neo-epitope target repertoire of cancers, enabling the effective targeting of every patient's tumour with vaccines produced 'just in time'.","[Kreiter, Sebastian; Diken, Mustafa; Loewer, Martin; Diekmann, Jan; Boegel, Sebastian; Schroers, Barbara; Vascotto, Fulvia; Castle, John C.; Tadmor, Arbel D.; Tuereci, Oezlem; Sahin, Ugur] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Univ Med Ctr, TRON Translat Oncol, D-55131 Mainz, Germany; [Vormehr, Mathias; van de Roemer, Niels; Huber, Christoph; Sahin, Ugur] Res Ctr Immunotherapy FZI, D-55131 Mainz, Germany; [Diekmann, Jan; Sahin, Ugur] Biopharmaceut New Technol BioNTech Corp, D-55131 Mainz, Germany; [Schoenberger, Stephen P.] La Jolla Inst Allergy & Immunol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Sahin, U (reprint author), Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Univ Med Ctr, TRON Translat Oncol, Freiligrathstr 12, D-55131 Mainz, Germany.",sahin@uni-mainz.de,"Sahin, Ugur/L-4818-2017","Sahin, Ugur/0000-0003-0363-1564; Vormehr, Mathias/0000-0001-7788-3380; Boegel, Sebastian/0000-0001-5425-8304",CI3 excellence cluster program of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF),"We thank M.

A tremendous effort has been made to restore p53 activity in cancer therapies'''. However, no effective p53-based therapy has been successfully translated into clinical cancer treatment owing to the complexity of p53 signalling. Here we demonstrate that genomic deletion of TP53 frequently encompasses essential neighbouring genes, rendering cancer cells with hemizygous TP53 deletion vulnerable to further suppression of such genes. POLR2A is identified as such a gene that is almost always co-deleted with TP53 in human cancers. It encodes the largest and catalytic subunit of the RNA polymerase II complex, which is specifically inhibited by a-amanitin"". Our analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) databases reveals that POLR2A expression levels are tightly correlated with its gene copy numbers in human colorectal cancer. Suppression of POLR2A with alpha-amanitin or small interfering RNAs selectively inhibits the proliferation, survival and tumorigenic potential of colorectal cancer cells with hemizygous TP53 loss in a p53-independent manner. Previous clinical applications of a-amanitin have been limited owing to its liver toxicity'.

Here we show that low doses of alpha-amanitin-conjugated anti-epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) antibody lead to complete tumour regression in mouse models of human colorectal cancer with hemizygous deletion of POLR2A.

The octahaem cytochrome c MccA (also known as SirA) catalyses this reaction for dissimilatory sulfite utilization by various bacteria. It is distinct from known sulfite reductases because it has a substantially higher catalytic activity and a relatively low reactivity towards nitrite. The mechanistic reasons for the increased efficiency of MccA remain to be elucidated. Here we show that anoxically purified MccA exhibited a 2- to 5.5-fold higher specific sulfite reductase activity than the enzyme isolated under oxic conditions2. We determined the threedimensional structure of MccA to 2.2 A resolution by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion. We find a homotrimer with an unprecedented fold and haem arrangement, as well as a haem bound to a CX15CH motif'. The heterobimetallic active-site haem 2 has a Cu(I) ion juxtaposed to a haem cat a Fe-Cu distance of 4.4 A. While the combination of metals is reminiscent of respiratory haem-copper oxidases, the oxidation-labile Cu(I) centre of MccA did not seem to undergo a redox transition during catalysis. Intact MccA tightly bound SO2 at haem 2, a dehydration product of the substrate sulfite that was partially turned over due to photoreduction by X-ray irradiation, yielding the reaction intermediate SO. Our data show the biometal copper in a new context and function and provide a chemical rationale for the comparatively high catalytic activity of MccA.","[Hermann, Bianca; Einsle, Oliver] Univ Freiburg, Inst Biochem, Lehrstuhl Biochem, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Kern, Melanie; La Pietra, Luigi; Simon, Joerg] Tech Univ Darmstadt, Dept Biol, Microbial Energy Convers & Biotechnol, D-64287 Darmstadt, Germany; [Einsle, Oliver] BIOSS Ctr Biol Signalling Studies, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany","Einsle, O (reprint author), Univ Freiburg, Inst Biochem, Lehrstuhl Biochem, Albertstr 21, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany.",simon@bio.tu-darmstadt.de; einsle@biochemie.uni-freiburg.de,"Simon, Jorg/F-2355-2016","Simon, Jorg/0000-0003-0214-3745; Einsle, Oliver/0000-0001-8722-2893","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [El 520/5, SI 848/7]; BIOSS Centre for Biological Signaling Studies at Albert-Ludwigs-Universitat Freiburg","This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (El 520/5 to O.E. and SI 848/7 to J.S.) and the BIOSS Centre for Biological Signaling Studies at Albert-Ludwigs-Universitat Freiburg.

However, little is known about when, where and how oxytocin modulates neural circuits to improve social cognition. Here we show how oxytocin enables pup retrieval behaviour in female mice by enhancing auditory cortical pup call responses. Retrieval behaviour required the left but not right auditory cortex, was accelerated by oxytocin in the left auditory cortex, and oxytocin receptors were preferentially expressed in the left auditory cortex. Neural responses to pup calls were lateralized, with co-tuned and temporally precise excitatory and inhibitory responses in the left cortex of maternal but not pup-naive adults. Finally, pairing calls with oxytocin enhanced responses by balancing the magnitude and timing of inhibition with excitation. Our results describe fundamental synaptic mechanisms by which oxytocin increases the salience of acoustic social stimuli. Furthermore, oxytocin-induced plasticity provides a biological basis for lateralization of auditory cortical processing.","[Marlin, Bianca J.; Mitre, Mariela; D'amour, James A.; Chao, Moses V.; Froemke, Robert C.] NYU, Sch Med, Skirball Inst Biomol Med, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Marlin, Bianca J.; Mitre, Mariela; D'amour, James A.; Chao, Moses V.; Froemke, Robert C.] NYU, Sch Med, Neurosci Inst, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Marlin, Bianca J.; Mitre, Mariela; D'amour, James A.; Froemke, Robert C.] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Otolaryngol, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Marlin, Bianca J.; Mitre, Mariela; D'amour, James A.; Chao, Moses V.; Froemke, Robert C.] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Neurosci & Physiol, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Mitre, Mariela; Chao, Moses V.] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Mitre, Mariela; Chao, Moses V.] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Chao, Moses V.; Froemke, Robert C.] NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA","Froemke, RC (reprint author), NYU, Sch Med, Skirball Inst Biomol Med, New York, NY 10016 USA.",robert.froemke@med.nyu.edu,,"Chao, Moses/0000-0002-6969-3744; Froemke, Robert/0000-0002-1230-6811","NIDCD [DC009635, DC12557]; Klingenstein Fellowship; McKnight Scholarship; Pew Scholarship; Sloan Research Fellowship; Whitehead Foundation; Skirball Institute Collaborative Research Award; NIMH [T32]","We thank V.

In the process of CRISPR adaptation, short pieces of DNA ('spacers') are acquired from foreign elements and integrated into the CRISPR array. So far, it has remained a mystery how spacers are preferentially acquired from the foreign DNA while the self chromosome is avoided. Here we show that spacer acquisition is replication-dependent, and that DNA breaks formed at stalled replication forks promote spacer acquisition. Chromosomal hotspots of spacer acquisition were confined by Chi sites, which are sequence octamers highly enriched on the bacterial chromosome, suggesting that these sites limit spacer acquisition from self DNA. We further show that the avoidance of self is mediated by the RecBCD double-stranded DNA break repair complex. Our results suggest that, in Escherichia coli, acquisition of new spacers largely depends on RecBCD-mediated processing of double-stranded DNA breaks occurring primarily at replication forks, and that the preference for foreign DNA is achieved through the higher density of Chi sites on the self chromosome, in combination with the higher number of forks on the foreign DNA. This model explains the strong preference to acquire spacers both from high copy plasmids and from phages.","[Levy, Asaf; Amitai, Gil; Sorek, Rotem] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Mol Genet, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Goren, Moran G.; Yosef, Ido; Auster, Oren; Manor, Miriam; Edgar, Rotem; Qimron, Udi] Tel Aviv Univ, Sackler Sch Med, Dep Clin Microbiol & Immunol, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel","Qimron, U (reprint author), Tel Aviv Univ, Sackler Sch Med, Dep Clin Microbiol & Immunol, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",ehudq@post.tau.ac.il; rotem.sorek@weizmann.ac.il,,,"Israel Science Foundation [1303/12, 1796, 268/14]; European Research Council [260432, 336079]; Human Frontier Science Program [RGP0011/2013]; Abisch-Frenkel foundation; Pasteur-Weizmann Council; Minerva Foundation; Deutsch-Israelische Projektkooperation grant from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Israeli Ministry of Health [9988-3]; Azrieli Foundation","We thank N.

For those forming low-mass stars (<8 solar masses), the competition between self-gravity and turbulent pressure along the dynamically dominant intercloud magnetic field (10 to 100 parsecs) shapes the clouds to be elongated either perpendicularly(4) or parallel(5) to the fields. A recent study(6) also suggested that on the scales of 0.1 to 0.01 parsecs, such fields are dynamically important within cloud cores forming massive stars (>8 solar masses). But whether the core fieldmorphologies are inherited from the intercloud medium or governed by cloud turbulence is unknown, as is the effect of magnetic fields on cloud fragmentation at scales of 10 to 0.1 parsecs(7-9). Here we report magnetic-field maps inferred from polarimetric observations of NGC6334, a region forming massive stars, on the 100 to 0.01 parsec scale. NGC6334 hosts young star-forming sites(10-12) where fields are not severely affected by stellar feedback, and their directions do not change much over the entire scale range. This means that the fields are dynamically important. The ordered fields lead to a self-similar gas fragmentation: at all scales, there exist elongated gas structures nearly perpendicular to the fields. Many gas elongations have density peaks near the ends, which symmetrically pinch the fields. The field strength is proportional to the 0.4th power of the density, which is an indication of anisotropic gas contractions along the field. We conclude that magnetic fields have a crucial role in the fragmentation of NGC6334.","[Li, Hua-bai; Yuen, Ka Ho; Otto, Frank; Leung, Po Kin] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Phys, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Sridharan, T.

Pioneering photon counting experiments, such as the intensity interferometry performed by Hanbury Brown and Twiss(3) to measure the angular width of visible stars, have played a critical role in our understanding of the full quantum nature of light(4). As with matter at the atomic scale, the laws of quantum mechanics also govern the properties of macroscopic mechanical objects, providing fundamental quantum limits to the sensitivity of mechanical sensors and transducers. Current research in cavity optomechanics seeks to use light to explore the quantum properties of mechanical systems ranging in size from kilogram-mass mirrors to nanoscale membranes(5), as well as to develop technologies for precision sensing(6) and quantum information processing(7,8). Here we use an optical probe and single-photon detection to study the acoustic emission and absorption processes in a silicon nanomechanical resonator, and perform a measurement similar to that used by Hanbury Brown and Twiss to measure correlations in the emitted phonons as the resonator undergoes a parametric instability formally equivalent to that of a laser(9). Owing to the cavity-enhanced coupling of light with mechanical motion, this effective phonon counting technique has a noise equivalent phonon sensitivity of 0.89 +/- 0.05. With straightforward improvements to this method, a variety of quantum state engineering tasks using mesoscopic mechanical resonators would be enabled(10), including the generation and heralding of single-phonon Fock states(11) and the quantum entanglement of remote mechanical elements(12,13).","[Cohen, Justin D.; Meenehan, Sean M.; MacCabe, Gregory S.; Groeblacher, Simon; Painter, Oskar] CALTECH, Inst Quantum Informat & Matter, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Cohen, Justin D.; Meenehan, Sean M.; MacCabe, Gregory S.; Groeblacher, Simon; Safavi-Naeini, Amir H.; Painter, Oskar] CALTECH, Thomas J Watson Senior Lab Appl Phys, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Groeblacher, Simon] Univ Vienna, Fac Phys, Vienna Ctr Quantum Sci & Technol VCQ, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Safavi-Naeini, Amir H.] Stanford Univ, Edward L Ginzton Lab, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Marsili, Francesco; Shaw, Matthew D.] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA","Painter, O (reprint author), CALTECH, Inst Quantum Informat & Matter, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",opainter@caltech.edu,,,DARPA; Institute for Quantum Information and Matter; NSF Physics Frontiers Center; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation; Kavli Nanoscience Institute at Caltech; NASA; NSERC; Marie Curie International Out-going Fellowship within the 7th European Community Framework Programme,"We thank F.

Landscapes tend towards an equilibrium in which rivers attain a stable grade that balances the tectonic production of elevation and with hillslopes that attain a gradient steep enough to transport material to river channels. Equilibrium low-relief surfaces are typically found at low elevations, graded to sea level. However, there are many examples of high-elevation, low-relief surfaces, often referred to as relict landscapes(1,2), or as elevated peneplains(3). These do not grade to sea level and are typically interpreted as uplifted old landscapes, preserving former, more moderate tectonic conditions(4). Here we test this model of landscape evolution through digital topographic analysis of a set of purportedly relict landscapes on the southeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, one of the most geographically complex, climatically varied and biologically diverse regions of the world. We find that, in contrast to theory, the purported surfaces are not consistent with progressive establishment of a new, steeper, river grade, and therefore they cannot necessarily be interpreted as a remnant of an old, low relief surface. We propose an alternative model, supported by numerical experiments, in which tectonic deformation has disrupted the regional river network, leaving remnants of it isolated and starved of drainage area and thus unable to balance tectonic uplift. The implication is that the state of low relief with low erosion rate is developing in situ, rather than preserving past erosional conditions.","[Yang, Rong; Willett, Sean D.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Geol Inst, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Goren, Liran] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Geol & Environm Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel","Yang, R (reprint author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Geol Inst, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",rong.yang@erdw.ethz.ch,"Willett, Sean/B-1716-2008",,,,,33,40,44,13,56,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,23-Apr,2015,520,7548,,,,,526,+,,10.1038/nature14354,,14,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,CG5LX,WOS:000353334500039,25903633,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Uniform, terrestrial-mantle-like W isotopic compositions have been reported(1,2) among crystallization products of the lunar magma ocean. These observations were interpreted to reflect formation of the Moon and crystallization of the lunar magma ocean after Hf-182 was no longer extant-that is, more than about 60 million years after the Solar System formed. Here we present W isotope data for three lunar samples that are more precise by a factor of >= 4 than those previously reported(1,2). The new data reveal that the lunar mantle has a well-resolved W-182 excess of 20.6 +/- 5.1 parts per million (+/- 2 standard deviations), relative to the modern terrestrial mantle. The offset between the mantles of the Moon and the modern Earth is best explained by assuming that the W isotopic compositions of the two bodies were identical immediately following formation of the Moon, and that they then diverged as a result of disproportional late accretion to the Earth and Moon(3,4). One implication of this model is that metal from the core of the Moon-forming impactor must have efficiently stripped the Earth's mantle of highly siderophile elements on its way to merge with the terrestrial core, requiring a substantial, but still poorly defined, level of metal-silicate equilibration.","[Touboul, Mathieu; Puchtel, Igor S.; Walker, Richard J.] Univ Maryland, Dept Geol, Isotope Geochem Lab, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Touboul, M (reprint author), Univ Lyon 1, Ecole Normale Super Lyon, Lab Geol Lyon, Labex LIO, F-69364 Lyon 7, France.",mathieu.touboul@ens-lyon.fr; ipuchtel@umd.edu; rjwalker@umd.edu,"Walker, Richard/K-6869-2016","Walker, Richard/0000-0003-0348-2407",NASA [NNX13AF83G],This work was supported by NASA Cosmochemistry grant NNX13AF83G.

Core formation should have removed the highly siderophile elements (HSE) from Earth's primitive mantle (that is, the bulk silicate Earth), yet HSE abundances are higher than expected(2). One explanation for this overabundance is that a 'late veneer' of primitive material was added to the bulk silicate Earth after the core formed(2). To test this hypothesis, tungsten isotopes are useful for two reasons: first, because the late veneer material had a different W-182/W-184 ratio to that of the bulk silicate Earth, and second, proportionally more material was added to the Earth than to the Moon(3). Thus, if a late veneer did occur, the bulk silicate Earth and the Moon must have different W-182/W-184 ratios. Moreover, the Moon-forming impact would also have created W-182 differences because the mantle and core material of the impactor with distinct W-182/W-184 would have mixed with the proto-Earth during the giant impact. However the W-182/W-184 of the Moon has not been determined precisely enough to identify signatures of a late veneer or the giant impact. Here, using more-precise measurement techniques, we show that the Moon exhibits a W-182 excess of 27 +/- 4 parts per million over the present-day bulk silicate Earth. This excess is consistent with the expected W-182 difference resulting from a late veneer with a total mass and composition inferred from HSE systematics(2). Thus, our data independently show that HSE abundances in the bulk silicate Earth were established after the giant impact and core formation, as predicted by the late veneer hypothesis. But, unexpectedly, we find that before the late veneer, no W-182 anomaly existed between the bulk silicate Earth and the Moon, even though one should have arisen through the giant impact. The origin of the homogeneous W-182 of the pre-late-veneer bulk silicate Earth and the Moon is enigmatic and constitutes a challenge to current models of lunar origin.","[Kruijer, Thomas S.; Kleine, Thorsten; Fischer-Goedde, Mario; Sprung, Peter] Univ Munster, Inst Planetol, D-48149 Munster, Germany","Kruijer, TS (reprint author), Univ Munster, Inst Planetol, Wilhelm Klemm Str 10, D-48149 Munster, Germany.",thomas.kruijer@wwu.de,"Kleine, Thorsten/S-2792-2017","Kleine, Thorsten/0000-0003-4657-5961",,,,60,45,45,10,58,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,23-Apr,2015,520,7548,,,,,534,+,,10.1038/nature14360,,15,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,CG5LX,WOS:000353334500041,25855296,No,Y,N,11/20/17

The time and place of platyrrhine origins are some of the most controversial issues in primate palaeontology, although an African Palaeogene ancestry has been presumed by most primatologists(3,4). Until now, the oldest fossil records of New World monkeys have come from Salla, Bolivia(5,6), and date to approximately 26 million years ago(7), or the Late Oligocene epoch. Here we report the discovery of new primates from the ? Late Eocene epoch of Amazonian Peru, which extends the fossil record of primates in South America back approximately 10 million years. The new specimens are important for understanding the origin and early evolution of modern platyrrhine primates because they bear little resemblance to any extinct or living South American primate, but they do bear striking resemblances to Eocene African anthropoids, and our phylogenetic analysis suggests a relationship with African taxa. The discovery of these new primates brings the first appearance datum of caviomorph rodents and primates in South America back into close correspondence, but raises new questions about the timing and means of arrival of these two mammalian groups.","Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Museo Ciencias Nat La Plata, Div Paleontol Vertebrados, La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina; Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Ctr Nacl Patagon, RA-9120 Puerto Madryn, Chubut, Argentina; Fac Ciencias Nat, Sede Trelew, Argentina; Univ Nacl Patagonia San Juan Bosco, RA-9100 Trelew, Chubut, Argentina; Nat Hist Museum Los Angeles Cty, Vertebrate Zool, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA; Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Museo Argentino Ciencias Nat Bernardino Rivadavia, Secc Paleontol Vertebrados, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; Univ Nacl Lujan, Dept Ciencias Basicas, RA-6700 Lujan, Buenos Aires, Argentina","Campbell, KE (reprint author), Nat Hist Museum Los Angeles Cty, Vertebrate Zool, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA.",kcampbell@nhm.org,,,National Geographic Society; National Science Foundation [DBI-0216506],"INGEMMET, Lima, has been a partner and supporter of the field work in Amazonia led by K.E.C. and C.D.

A shared goal of ecology and epidemiology is to predict when a species is most vulnerable to disease. A leading hypothesis asserts that the impact of disease should increase with host abundance, producing a 'rare-species advantage'(3-5). However, the impact of a pathogen may be decoupled from host abundance, because most pathogens infect more than one species, leading to pathogen spillover onto closely related species(6,7). Here we show that the phylogenetic and ecological structure of the surrounding community can be important predictors of disease pressure. We found that the amount of tissue lost to disease increased with the relative abundance of a species across a grassland plant community, and that this rare-species advantage had an additional phylogenetic component: disease pressure was stronger on species with many close relatives. We used a global model of pathogen sharing as a function of relatedness between hosts, which provided a robust predictor of relative disease pressure at the local scale. In our grassland, the total amount of disease was most accurately explained not by the abundance of the focal host alone, but by the abundance of all species in the community weighted by their phylogenetic distance to the host. Furthermore, the model strongly predicted observed disease pressure for 44 novel host species we introduced experimentally to our study site, providing evidence for a mechanism to explain why phylogenetically rare species are more likely to become invasive when introduced(8,9). Our results demonstrate how the phylogenetic and ecological structure of communities can have a key role in disease dynamics, with implications for the maintenance of biodiversity, biotic resistance against introduced weeds, and the success of managed plants in agriculture and forestry.","[Parker, Ingrid M.; Bontrager, Megan; Weitz, Andrew P.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Parker, Ingrid M.; Gilbert, Gregory S.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Panama; [Saunders, Megan; Hendricks, Rebecca; Gilbert, Gregory S.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Magarey, Roger; Suiter, Karl] N Carolina State Univ, Ctr Integrated Pest Management, Raleigh, NC 27606 USA","Parker, IM (reprint author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",imparker@ucsc.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [DEB-0842059, DEB-1136626]; G.S.G.

During water deficit, plants produce elevated levels of abscisic acid (ABA), which improves water consumption and stress tolerance by controlling guard cell aperture and other protective responses(1,2). One attractive strategy for controlling water use is to develop compounds that activate ABA receptors, but agonists approved for use have yet to be developed. In principle, an engineered ABA receptor that can be activated by an existing agrochemical could achieve this goal. Here we describe a variant of the ABA receptor PYRABACTIN RESISTANCE 1 (PYR1) that possesses nanomolar sensitivity to the agrochemical mandipropamid and demonstrate its efficacy for controlling ABA responses and drought tolerance in transgenic plants. Furthermore, crystallographic studies provide a mechanistic basis for its activity and demonstrate the relative ease with which the PYR1 ligand-binding pocket can be altered to accommodate new ligands. Thus, we have successfully repurposed an agrochemical for a new application using receptor engineering. We anticipate that this strategy will be applied to other plant receptors and represents a new avenue for crop improvement.","[Park, Sang-Youl; Mosquna, Assaf; Yao, Jin; Cutler, Sean R.] Univ Calif Riverside, Ctr Plant Cell Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Park, Sang-Youl; Mosquna, Assaf; Yao, Jin; Cutler, Sean R.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Park, Sang-Youl; Mosquna, Assaf; Yao, Jin; Cutler, Sean R.] Inst Integrat Genome Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Peterson, Francis C.; Volkman, Brian F.] Med Coll Wisconsin, Dept Biochem, Milwaukee, WI 53226 USA","Cutler, SR (reprint author), Univ Calif Riverside, Ctr Plant Cell Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",sean.cutler@ucr.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [IOS 1258175, MCB 1022378]; Syngenta Corporation; United States-Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development Postdoctoral Fellowship [F1-440-2010]","We thank N.

The accumulation of DNA damage in HSCs is a hallmark of ageing and is probably a major contributing factor in age-related tissue degeneration and malignant transformation'. A number of accelerated ageing syndromes are associated with defective DNA repair and genomic instability, including the most common inherited bone marrow failure syndrome, Fanconi anaemia'''. However, the physiological source of DNA damage in HSCs from both normal and diseased individuals remains unclear. Here we show in mice that DNA damage is a direct consequence of inducing HSCs to exit their homeostatic quiescent state in response to conditions that model physiological stress, such as infection or chronic blood loss. Repeated activation of HSCs out of their dormant state provoked the attrition of normal HSCs and, in the case of mice with a nonfunctional Fanconi anaemia DNA repair pathway, led to a complete collapse of the haematopoietic system, which phenocopied the highly penetrant bone marrow failure seen in Fanconi anaemia patients. Our findings establish a novel link between physiological stress and DNA damage in normal HSCs and provide a mechanistic explanation for the universal accumulation of DNA damage in HSCs during ageing and the accelerated failure of the haematopoietic system in Fanconi anaemia patients.","[Walter, Dagmar; Lier, Amelie; Huntscha, Sina; Klein, Corinna; Essers, Marieke A.

The abundant mtDNA-binding protein TFAM (transcription factor A, mitochondrial) regulates nucleoid architecture, abundance and segregation(2). Complete mtDNA depletion profoundly impairs oxidative phosphorylation, triggering calcium-dependent stress signalling and adaptive metabolic responses'. However, the cellular responses to mtDNA instability, a physiologically relevant stress observed in many human diseases and ageing, remain poorly defined(4). Here we show that moderate mtDNA stress elicited by TFAM deficiency engages cytosolic antiviral signalling to enhance the expression of a subset of interferon-stimulated genes. Mechanistically, we find that aberrant mtDNA packaging promotes escape of mtDNA into the cytosol, where it engages the DNA sensor cGAS (also known as MB21D1) and promotes STING (also known as TMEM173)-IRF3-dependent signalling to elevate interferon-stimulated gene expression, potentiate type I interferon responses and confer broad viral resistance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that herpesviruses induce mtDNA stress, which enhances antiviral signalling and type I interferon responses during infection. Our results further demonstrate that mitochondria are central participants in innate immunity, identify mtDNA stress as a cell-intrinsic trigger of antiviral signalling and suggest that cellular monitoring of mtDNA homeostasis cooperates with canonical virus sensing mechanisms to fully engage antiviral innate immunity.","[West, A.

Super-enhancers (SEs), also known as stretch-enhancers, are a subset of enhancers especially important for genes associated with cell identity and genetic risk of disease(2-6). CD4(+) T cells are critical for host defence and autoimmunity. Here we analysed maps of mouse T-cell SEs as a non-biased means of identifying key regulatory nodes involved in cell specification. We found that cytokines and cytokine receptors were the dominant class of genes exhibiting SE architecture in T cells. Nonetheless, the locus encoding Bach2, a key negative regulator of effector differentiation, emerged as the most prominent T-cell SE, revealing a network in which SE-associated genes critical for T-cell biology are repressed by BACH2. Disease-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms for immune-mediated disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, were highly enriched for T-cell SEs versus typical enhancers or SEs in other cell lineages'. Intriguingly, treatment of T cells with the Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor tofacitinib disproportionately altered the expression of rheumatoid arthritis risk genes with SE structures. Together, these results indicate that genes with SE architecture in T cells encompass a variety of cytokines and cytokine receptors but are controlled by a 'guardian' transcription factor, itself endowed with an SE. Thus, enumeration of SEs allows the unbiased determination of key regulatory nodes in T cells, which are preferentially modulated by pharmacological intervention.","[Vahedi, Golnaz; Kanno, Yuka; Jiang, Kan; O'Shea, John J.] NIAMSD, Lymphocyte Cell Biol Sect, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Furumoto, Yasuko; Gadina, Massimo] NIAMS, Translat Immunol Sect, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Parker, Stephen C.

Membrane fusion activity is required for early biogenesis of autophagosomes and late degradation in lysosomes(3-7). However, the key regulatory mechanisms of autophagic membrane tethering and fusion remain largely unknown. Here we report that ATG14 (also known as bedin-1-associated autophagy-related key regulator (Barkor) or ATG14L), an essential autophagy-specific regulator of the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex(8-11), promotes membrane tethering of protein-free liposomes, and enhances hemifusion and full fusion of proteoliposomes reconstituted with the target (t)-SNAREs (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) syntaxin 17 (STX17) and SNAP29, and the vesicle (v)-SNARE VAMP8 (vesicle-associated membrane protein 8). ATG14 binds to the SNARE core domain of STX17 through its coiled-coil domain, and stabilizes the STX17-SNAP29 binary t-SNARE complex on autophagosomes. The STX17 binding, membrane tethering and fusion-enhancing activities of ATG14 require its homo-oligomerization by cysteine repeats. In ATG14 homo-oligomerization-defective cells, autophagosomes still efficiently form but their fusion with endolysosomes is blocked. Recombinant ATG14 homo-oligomerization mutants also completely lose their ability to promote membrane tethering and to enhance SNARE-mediated fusion in vitro. Taken together, our data suggest an autophagy-specific membrane fusion mechanism in which oligomeric ATG14 directly binds to STX17-SNAP29 binary t-SNARE complex on autophagosomes and primes it for VAMP8 interaction to promote autophagosome-endolysosome fusion.","[Diao, Jiajie; Zhao, Minglei; Lai, Ying; Zhou, Qiangjun; Vivona, Sandro; Pfuetzner, Richard A.; Brunger, Axel T.] Stanford Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Physiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Diao, Jiajie; Zhao, Minglei; Lai, Ying; Zhou, Qiangjun; Vivona, Sandro; Pfuetzner, Richard A.; Brunger, Axel T.] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Struct, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Diao, Jiajie; Zhao, Minglei; Lai, Ying; Zhou, Qiangjun; Vivona, Sandro; Pfuetzner, Richard A.; Brunger, Axel T.] Stanford Univ, Dept Photon Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Diao, Jiajie; Zhao, Minglei; Lai, Ying; Zhou, Qiangjun; Vivona, Sandro; Pfuetzner, Richard A.; Brunger, Axel T.] Stanford Univ, Dept Neurol & Neurol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Diao, Jiajie; Zhao, Minglei; Lai, Ying; Zhou, Qiangjun; Vivona, Sandro; Pfuetzner, Richard A.; Brunger, Axel T.] Stanford Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Liu, Rong; Rong, Yueguang; Zhang, Jing; Zhong, Qing] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Internal Med, Ctr Autophagy Res, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Liu, Rong; Rong, Yueguang; Zhang, Jing; Zhong, Qing] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Biochem, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Liu, Rong] China Agr Univ, Coll Food Sci & Nutr Engn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Wilz, Livia M.; Li, Jianxu] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Div Biochem Biophys & Struct Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Zhong, Q (reprint author), Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Internal Med, Ctr Autophagy Res, Dallas, TX 75390 USA.",qing.zhong@utsouthwestern.edu,"Diao, Jiajie/A-3425-2008; Zhao, Minglei/J-4446-2015; Lai, Ying/E-5220-2015","Diao, Jiajie/0000-0003-4288-3203; Zhao, Minglei/0000-0001-5832-6060; Lai, Ying/0000-0001-5347-5155; Brunger, Axel/0000-0001-5121-2036; Zhou, Qiangjun/0000-0002-7768-0249; Zhou, Qiangjun/0000-0003-1789-9588","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [P41 GM103403]; Welch Foundation [1-1864]; Cancer Prevention & Research Institute of Texas [RP140320]; American Cancer Society [RSG-11-274-01-CCG]; NIH [CA133228, R37-MH63105]; China Scholarship Council; National Cancer Institute of the NIH [5P30CA142543]","We thank Q.

Overall, the cryo-EM reconstruction at 2.9 angstrom resolution is comparable to the best-resolved X-ray structure of the E. coil 70S ribosome(5) (2.8 angstrom), but provides more detailed information (2.65 angstrom) at the functionally important ribosomal core. The cryo-EM map elucidates for the first time the structure of all 35 rRNA modifications in the bacterial ribosome, explaining their roles in fine-tuning ribosome structure and function and modulating the action of antibiotics. We also obtained atomic models for flexible parts of the ribosome such as ribosomal proteins L9 and L31.

The location of the abundant hydrogens is of key importance for understanding structure and function of the protein(2-6). However, in protein X-ray crystallography the detection of hydrogen atoms is one of the major problems, since they display only weak contributions to diffraction and the quality of the single crystals is often insufficient to obtain sub-angstrom resolution'. Here we report the crystal structure of a standard [NiFe] hydrogenase (similar to 91.3 ltDa molecular mass) at 0.89 angstrom resolution. The strictly anoxically isolated hydrogenase has been obtained in a specific spectroscopic state, the active reduced Ni-R (subform Ni-R1) state. The high resolution, proper refinement strategy and careful modelling allow the positioning of a large part of the hydrogen atoms in the structure. This has led to the direct detection of the products of the heterolytic splitting of dihydrogen into a hydride (H-) bridging the Ni and Fe and a proton (H+) attached to the sulphur of a cysteine ligand. The Ni-H- and Fe-H- bond lengths are 1.58 angstrom and 1.78 angstrom, respectively. Furthermore, we can assign the Fe-CO and Fe-CN- ligands at the active site, and can obtain the hydrogen-bond networks and the preferred proton transfer pathway in the hydrogenase. Our results demonstrate the precise comprehensive information available from ultra-high-resolution structures of proteins as an alternative to neutron diffraction and other methods such as NMR structural analysis.","[Ogata, Hideaki; Nishikawa, Koji; Lubitz, Wolfgang] Max Planck Inst Chem Energy Convers, D-45470 Mulheim, Germany","Ogata, H (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Chem Energy Convers, Stiftstr 34-36, D-45470 Mulheim, Germany.",hideaki.ogata@cec.mpg.de; wolfgang.lubitz@cec.mpg.de,"Ogata, Hideaki/J-4975-2013","Ogata, Hideaki/0000-0002-2894-2417",Max Planck Society; Bundesministerium far Bildung und Forschung (BMBF) [03SF0355C]; EU/Energy Network project SOLAR-H2 [212508]; Cluster of Excellence RESOLV - Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [EXC1069],"We thank P.

Here we report the crystal structures of human AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 at 2.9 and 2.4 angstrom resolution, respectively, which represent a novel class of receptor structure. The seven-transmembrane helices, conformationally distinct from those of G-protein-coupled receptors, enclose a large cavity where three conserved histidine residues coordinate a zinc ion. The zinc-binding structure may have a role in the adiponectin-stimulated AMPK phosphorylation and UCP2 upregulation. Adiponectin may broadly interact with the extracellular face, rather than the carboxy-terminal tail, of the receptors. The present information will facilitate the understanding of novel structure-function relationships and the development and optimization of AdipoR agonists for the treatment of obesity-related diseases, such as type 2 diabetes.","[Tanabe, Hiroaki; Fujii, Yoshifumi; Nakamura, Yoshihiro; Hosaka, Toshiaki; Motoyama, Kanna; Ikeda, Mariko; Wakiyama, Motoaki; Terada, Takaho; Ohsawa, Noboru; Hato, Masakatsu; Murata, Takeshi; Iwata, So; Kimura-Someya, Tomomi; Shirouzu, Mikako; Yokoyama, Shigeyuki] RIKEN, Syst & Struct Biol Ctr, Tsurumi Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Tanabe, Hiroaki; Yokoyama, Shigeyuki] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biophys & Biochem, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Tanabe, Hiroaki; Yokoyama, Shigeyuki] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Struct Biol Lab, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Tanabe, Hiroaki; Nakamura, Yoshihiro; Hosaka, Toshiaki; Ikeda, Mariko; Wakiyama, Motoaki; Ohsawa, Noboru; Hato, Masakatsu; Kimura-Someya, Tomomi; Shirouzu, Mikako] RIKEN, Ctr Life Sci Technol, Div Struct & Synthet Biol, Tsurumi Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Tanabe, Hiroaki; Fujii, Yoshifumi; Nakamura, Yoshihiro; Terada, Takaho; Yokoyama, Shigeyuki] RIKEN, Struct Biol Lab, Tsurumi Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Okada-Iwabu, Miki; Iwabu, Masato; Yamauchi, Toshimasa; Kadowaki, Takashi] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Med, Dept Diabet & Metab Dis, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Okada-Iwabu, Miki; Iwabu, Masato; Yamauchi, Toshimasa; Kadowaki, Takashi] Univ Tokyo, Dept Integrated Mol Sci Metab Dis, Century Med & Res Ctr 22, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Iwabu, Masato] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, PRESTO, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; [Ogasawara, Satoshi; Hino, Tomoya; Murata, Takeshi; Iwata, So] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Hino, Tomoya; Murata, Takeshi; Iwata, So] JST, Res Accelerat Program, Membrane Prot Crystallog Project, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Murata, Takeshi] Chiba Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Chem, Inage Ku, Chiba 2638522, Japan; [Iwata, So] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Membrane Prot Crystallog Grp, Div Mol Biosci, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Iwata, So] Diamond Light Source, Didcot OX11 0DE, Oxon, England; [Iwata, So; Hirata, Kunio; Kawano, Yoshiaki; Yamamoto, Masaki] RIKEN, SPring Ctr 8, Harima Inst, Sayo, Hyogo 6795148, Japan; [Yamauchi, Toshimasa] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, CREST, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan","Yokoyama, S (reprint author), RIKEN, Syst & Struct Biol Ctr, Tsurumi Ku, 1-7-22 Suehiro Cho, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan.",tyamau-tky@umin.net; kadowaki-3im@h.u-tokyo.ac.jp; yokoyama@riken.jp,"Kawano, Yoshiaki/C-7585-2017; Yokoyama, Shigeyuki/N-6911-2015; Murata, Takeshi/J-6181-2017; Yamamoto, Masaki/B-7844-2015; Shirouzu, Mikako/A-6521-2016; Wakiyama, Motoaki/N-6928-2015; Kimura-Someya, Tomomi/C-4169-2017","Yokoyama, Shigeyuki/0000-0003-3133-7338; Yamamoto, Masaki/0000-0002-1311-1768; ","Targeted Proteins Research Program; Platform for Drug Discovery, Informatics and Structural Life Science; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan [26000012, 20229008, 25221307, 26293216, 30557236]; Japan Science and Technology Agency; BBSRC [BB/G02325/1]; Wellcome Trust [062164/Z/00/Z]","We are grateful to the staffs of BL32XU at SPring-8 (proposals 2012A1332, 201281453, 2013A1008, 2013A1008, 201381034, 201381007, 2014A1007, 2014A1008 and 2014A1186), beamline X06SA at Diamond Light Source, and beamline X06SA at the Swiss Light Source for their assistance in data collection.

Historically, CK Vul has been considered to be a nova (Nova Vul 1670), but its similarity to 'red transients', which are more luminous than classical novae and thought to be the results of stellar collisions(4), has re-opened the question of CK Vul's status5'6. Red transients cool to resemble late M-type stars, surrounded by circumstellar material rich in molecules and dust(7-9). No stellar source has been seen in CK Vul, though a radio continuum source was identified at the expansion centre of the nebula'. Here we report that CK Vul is surrounded by chemically rich molecular gas in the form of an outflow, as well as dust. The gas has peculiar isotopic ratios, revealing that CK Vul's composition was strongly enhanced by the nuclear ashes of hydrogen burning. The chemical composition cannot be reconciled with a nova or indeed any other known explosion. In addition, the mass of the surrounding gas is too large for a nova, though the conversion from observations of CO to a total mass is uncertain. We conclude that CK Vul is best explained as the remnant of a merger of two stars.","[Kaminski, Tomasz] European So Observ, Santiago, Chile; [Kaminski, Tomasz; Menten, Karl M.; Kraus, Alexander] Max Planck Inst Radioastron, D-53121 Bonn, Germany; [Tylenda, Romuald; Hajduk, Marcin] N Copernicus Astron Ctr, Dept Astrophys, PL-87100 Torun, Poland; [Patel, Nimesh A.] Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Kaminski, T (reprint author), European So Observ, Alonso de Cordova 3107, Santiago, Chile.",tkaminsk@eso.org,"Hajduk, Marcin/C-9693-2014","Hajduk, Marcin/0000-0001-6028-9932",,,,49,15,16,0,7,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,16-Apr,2015,520,7547,,,,,322,+,,10.1038/nature14257,,11,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,CG0RI,WOS:000352974200032,25799986,No,,,11/20/17

Rechargeable aluminium-based batteries offer the possibilities of low cost and low flammability, together with three-electron-redox properties leading to high capacity'. However, research efforts over the past 30 years have encountered numerous problems, such as cathode material disintegration'', low cell discharge voltage (about 0.55 volts; ref. 5), capacitive behaviour without discharge voltage plateaus (1.1-0.2 volts(6) or 1.8-0.8 volts(7)) and insufficient cycle life (less than 100 cycles) with rapid capacity decay (by 26-85 per cent over 100 cydes)(4-7). Here we present a rechargeable aluminium battery with high-rate capability that uses an aluminium metal anode and a three-dimensional graphitic-foam cathode. The battery operates through the electrochemical deposition and dissolution of aluminium at the anode, and intercalation/de-intercalation of chloroaluminate anions in the graphite, using a non-flammable ionic liquid electrolyte. The cell exhibits well-defined discharge voltage plateaus near 2 volts, a specific capacity of about 70 mA h g(-1) and a Coulombic efficiency of approximately 98 per cent. The cathode was found to enable fast anion diffusion and intercalation, affording charging times of around one minute with a current density of similar to 4,000 mA g(-1) (equivalent to similar to 3,000 W kg(-1)) and to withstand more than 7,500 cycles without capacity decay.","[Lin, Meng-Chang; Gong, Ming; Lu, Bingan; Wu, Yingpeng; Wang, Di-Yan; Guan, Mingyun; Angell, Michael; Chen, Changxin; Yang, Jiang; Dai, Hongjie] Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lin, Meng-Chang] Ind Technol Res Inst, Green Energy & Environm Res Labs, Hsinchu 31040, Taiwan; [Lu, Bingan] Hunan Univ, Sch Phys & Elect, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Di-Yan] Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Chem, Taipei 11677, Taiwan; [Wang, Di-Yan] Acad Sinica, Inst Atom & Mol Sci, Taipei 10617, Taiwan; [Hwang, Bing-Joe] Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Chem Engn, Taipei 10607, Taiwan","Dai, HJ (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",hdai@stanford.edu,,,"Bureau of Energy, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Taiwan; National Natural Science Foundation of China [21303046]; China Scholarship Council [201308430178]; Hunan University Fund for Multidisciplinary Developing [531107040762]; US Department of Energy for novel carbon materials development and electrical characterization work [DOE DE-SC0008684]; Stanford GCEP; Precourt Institute of Energy; Global Networking Talent 3.0 plan from the Ministry of Education of Taiwan [NTUST 104DI005]","We thank M.

Flow systems have several advantages over batch systems, particularly in terms of productivity, heat and mixing efficiency, safety, and reproducibility'. However, for over half a century, pharmaceutical manufacturing has used batch systems because the synthesis of complex molecules such as drugs has been difficult to achieve with continuous-flow systems'''. Here we describe the continuous-flow synthesis of drugs using only columns packed with heterogeneous catalysts. Commercially available starting materials were successively passed through four columns containing achiral and chiral heterogeneous catalysts to produce (R)-rolipram', an anti-inflammatory drug and one of the family of y-aminobutyric acid (GABA) derivatives'. In addition, simply by replacing a column packed with a chiral heterogeneous catalyst with another column packed with the opposing enantiomer, we obtained antipole (S)-rolipram. Similarly, we also synthesized (R)-phenibut, another drug belonging to the GABA family. These flow systems are simple and stable with no leaching of metal catalysts. Our results demonstrate that multistep (eight steps in this case) chemical transformations for drug synthesis can proceed smoothly under flow conditions using only heterogeneous catalysts, without the isolation of any intermediates and without the separation of any catalysts, co-products, by-products, and excess reagents. We anticipate that such syntheses will be useful in pharmaceutical manufacturing.","[Tsubogo, Tetsu; Oyamada, Hidekazu; Kobayashi, Shu] Univ Tokyo, Sch Sci, Dept Chem, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Tsubogo, Tetsu; Oyamada, Hidekazu; Kobayashi, Shu] Univ Tokyo, Sch Sci, Green & Sustainable Chem Social Cooperat Lab, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan","Kobayashi, S (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Sch Sci, Dept Chem, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",shu_kobayashi@chem.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Kobayashi, Shu/E-9214-2012",,"Global COE Program, The University of Tokyo, MEXT, Japan; ACT-C; Center of Innovation (COI) Program; Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST)","This work was partially supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Science Research from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), Global COE Program, The University of Tokyo, MEXT, Japan, the ACT-C and Center of Innovation (COI) Program, and the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST).",,30,86,86,13,101,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,16-Apr,2015,520,7547,,,,,329,332,,10.1038/nature14343,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,CG0RI,WOS:000352974200034,25877201,No,Y,N,11/20/17

In particular, the sequence of Dansgaard Oeschger events (repeated transitions between warm interstadial and cold stadial conditions), as recorded by ice cores in Greenland', are thought to be linked to changes in the mode of overturning circulation in the Atlantic Ocean'. Moreover, the observed correspondence between North Atlantic cold events and increased iceberg calving and dispersal from ice sheets surrounding the North Atlantic' has inspired many ocean and climate modelling studies that make use of freshwater forcing scenarios to simulate abrupt change across the North Atlantic region and beyond'. On the other hand, previous studies(4,8) identified an apparent lag between North Atlantic cooling events and the appearance of ice-rafted debris over the last glacial cycle, leading to the hypothesis that iceberg discharge may be a consequence of stadial conditions rather than the cause(4,9-11). Here we further establish this relationship and demonstrate a systematic delay between pronounced surface cooling and the arrival of ice-rafted debris at a site southwest of Iceland over the past four glacial cycles, implying that in general icebergs arrived too late to have triggered cooling. Instead we suggest that on the basis of our comparisons of ice-rafted debris and polar planktonic foraminifera abrupt transitions to stadial conditions should be considered as a nonlinear response to more gradual cooling across the North Atlantic. Although the freshwater derived from melting icebergs may provide a positive feedback for enhancing and or prolonging stadial conditions(10,11), it does not trigger northern stadial events.","[Barker, Stephen; Chen, James; Gong, Xun; Jonkers, Lukas] Cardiff Univ, Sch Earth & Ocean Sci, Cardiff CF10 3AT, S Glam, Wales; [Knorr, Gregor] Alfred Wegener Inst, Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, D-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany; [Thornalley, David] UCL, Dept Geog, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Thornalley, David] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA","Barker, S (reprint author), Cardiff Univ, Sch Earth & Ocean Sci, Cardiff CF10 3AT, S Glam, Wales.",barkers3@cf.ac.uk,"Stephen, Barker/C-2770-2009; Jonkers, Lukas/H-6314-2011","Stephen, Barker/0000-0001-7870-6431; Jonkers, Lukas/0000-0002-0253-2639","Philip Leverhulme Prize; Corner Science and Education Foundation (GCCF3); UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/L006405/1, NE/J008133/1]; 'Helmholtz Climate Initiative REKLIM' (Regional Climate Change); Helmholtz Association of German research centres (HGF); climate change consortium of Wales","We thank S.

This elevated Sm/Nd has been ascribed either to a 'hidden' reservoir in the Earth(1,2) or to loss of an early-formed terrestrial crust by impact ablation(3). Since removal of crust by ablation would also remove the heatproducing elements potassium, uranium and thorium such removal would make it extremely difficult to balance terrestrial heat production with the observed heat flow(3). In the 'hidden' reservoir alternative, a complementary low-Sm/Nd layer is usually considered to reside unobserved in the silicate lower mantle. We have previously shown, however, that the core is a likely reservoir for some lithophile elements such as niobium(4). We therefore address the question of whether core formation could have fractionated Nd from Sm and also acted as a sink for heat-producing elements. We show here that addition of a reduced Mercury-like body (or, alternatively, an enstatitechondrite-like body) rich in sulfur to the early Earth would generate a superchondritic Sm/Nd in the mantle and an Nd-142/Nd-144 anomaly of approximately +14 parts per million relative to chondrite. In addition, the sulfur-rich core would partition uranium strongly and thorium slightly, supplying a substantial part of the 'missing' heat source for the geodynamo.","[Wohlers, Anke; Wood, Bernard J.] Univ Oxford, Dept Earth Sci, Oxford OX1 3AN, England","Wohlers, A (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Dept Earth Sci, South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3AN, England.",anke.wohlers@earth.ox.ac.uk; berniew@earth.ox.ac.uk,"Wood, Bernard/E-8173-2010",,European Research Council [267764],We acknowledge support from the European Research Council grant number 267764.

Fishing is the primary source of diminished reef function globally(3-5), leading to widespread calls for additional marine reserves to recover fish biomass and restore key ecosystem functions(6). Yet there are no established baselines for determining when these conservation objectives have been met or whether alternative management strategies provide similar ecosystem benefits. Here we establish empirical conservation benchmarks and fish biomass recovery timelines against which coral reefs can be assessed and managed by studying the recovery potential of more than 800 coral reefs along an exploitation gradient. We show that resident reef fish biomass in the absence of fishing (B-0) averages similar to 1,000 kg ha(-1), and that the vast majority (83%) of fished reefs are missing more than half their expected biomass, with severe consequences for key ecosystem functions such as predation. Given protection from fishing, reef fish biomass has the potential to recover within 35 years on average and less than 60 years when heavily depleted. Notably, alternative fisheries restrictions are largely (64%) successful at maintaining biomass above 50% of B-0, sustaining key functions such as herbivory. Our results demonstrate that crucial ecosystem functions can be maintained through a range of fisheries restrictions, allowing coral reef managers to develop recovery plans that meet conservation and livelihood objectives in areas where marine reserves are not socially or politically feasible solutions.","[MacNeil, M.

This synaptic tag-and-capture model has been hypothesized to explain how inconsequential information is selectively consolidated following salient experiences. Behavioural evidence for tag-and-capture is provided by rodent studies in which weak early memories are strengthened by future behavioural training(2,3). Whether a process of behavioural tagging occurs in humans to transform weak episodic memories into stable long-term memories is unknown. Here we show, in humans, that information is selectively consolidated if conceptually related information, putatively represented in a common neural substrate, is made salient through an emotional learning experience. Memory for neutral objects was selectively enhanced if other objects from the same category were paired with shock. Retroactive enhancements as a result of emotional learning were observed following a period of consolidation, but were not observed in an immediate memory test or for items strongly encoded before fear conditioning. These findings provide new evidence for a generalized retroactive memory enhancement, whereby inconsequential information can be retroactively credited as relevant, and therefore selectively remembered, if conceptually related information acquires salience in the future.","[Dunsmoor, Joseph E.; Murty, Vishnu P.; Davachi, Lila; Phelps, Elizabeth A.] NYU, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Dunsmoor, Joseph E.; Murty, Vishnu P.; Davachi, Lila; Phelps, Elizabeth A.] NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Phelps, Elizabeth A.] Nathan S Kline Inst Psychiat Res, Orangeburg, NY 10962 USA","Davachi, L (reprint author), NYU, Dept Psychol, 6 Washington Pl, New York, NY 10003 USA.",lila.davachi@nyu.edu; liz.phelps@nyu.edu,,,"NIH [RO1 MH097085, R01 MH047692, F31 DA036361]; NIMH Training Award in Systems and Integrative Neuroscience [T32 MH019524]","We thank G.

Previously, it was shown that neurons in several circumventricular organs of the hypothalamus are activated by thirst-inducing conditions(1). Here we identify two distinct, genetically separable neural populations in the subfornical organ that trigger or suppress thirst. We show that optogenetic activation of subfornical organ excitatory neurons, marked by the expression of the transcription factor ETV-1, evokes intense drinking behaviour, and does so even in fully water-satiated animals. The light-induced response is highly specific for water, immediate and strictly locked to the laser stimulus. In contrast, activation of a second population of subfornical organ neurons, marked by expression of the vesicular GABA transporter VGAT, drastically suppresses drinking, even in water-craving thirsty animals. These results reveal an innate brain circuit that can turn an animal's water-drinking behaviour on and off, and probably functions as a centre for thirst control in the mammalian brain.","[Oka, Yuki; Ye, Mingyu; Zuker, Charles S.] Columbia Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Columbia Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Oka, Yuki; Ye, Mingyu; Zuker, Charles S.] Columbia Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Columbia Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Neurosci, New York, NY 10032 USA","Oka, Y (reprint author), CALTECH, Div Biol & Biol Engn 216 76, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",yoka@caltech.edu,,,National Institute on Drug Abuse; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke,"We thank N.

This evolutionary process culminates in the formation of metastases, which is the cause of 90% of cancer-related deaths(5). However, despite its clinical importance, little is known about the principles governing the dissemination of cancer cells to distant organs. Although the hypothesis that each metastasis originates from a single tumour cell is generally supported(6-8), recent studies using mouse models of cancer demonstrated the existence of polyclonal seeding from and interclonal cooperation between multiple subdonee(9,10). Here we sought definitive evidence for the existence of polydonal seeding in human malignancy and to establish the clonal relationship among different metastases in the context of androgendeprived metastatic prostate cancer. Using whole-genome sequencing, we characterized multiple metastases arising from prostate tumours in ten patients. Integrated analyses of subdonal architecture revealed the patterns of metastatic spread in unprecedented detail. Metastasis-to-metastasis spread was found to be common, either through de novo monoclonal seeding of daughter metastases or, in five cases, through the transfer of multiple tumour clones between metastatic sites. Lesions affecting tumour suppressor genes usually occur as single events, whereas mutations in genes involved in androgen receptor signalling commonly involve multiple, convergent events in different metastases. Our results elucidate in detail the complex patterns of metastatic spread and further our understanding of the development of resistance to androgen-deprivation therapy in prostate cancer.","[Gundem, Gunes; Van Loo, Peter; Kremeyer, Barbara; Alexandrov, Ludmil B.; Tubio, Jose M.

Others have demonstrated that individual cells within complex populations show heterogeneity in their capacity to form secondary lesions(2-5). Here we develop a polyclonal mouse model of breast tumour heterogeneity, and show that distinct clones within a mixed population display specialization, for example, dominating the primary tumour, contributing to metastatic populations, or showing tropism for entering the lymphatic or vasculature systems. We correlate these stable properties to distinct gene expression profiles. Those clones that efficiently enter the vasculature express two secreted proteins, Serpine2 and Slpi, which were necessary and sufficient to program these cells for vascular mimicry. Our data indicate that these proteins not only drive the formation of extravascular networks but also ensure their perfusion by acting as anticoagulants. We propose that vascular mimicry drives the ability of some breast tumour cells to contribute to distant metastases while simultaneously satisfying a critical need of the primary tumour to be fed by the vasculature. Enforced expression of SERPINE2 and SLPI in human breast cancer cell lines also programmed them for vascular mimicry, and SERPINE2 and SLPI were overexpressed preferentially in human patients that had lung-metastatic relapse. Thus, these two secreted proteins, and the phenotype they promote, may be broadly relevant as drivers of metastatic progression in human cancer.","[Wagenblast, Elvin; Soto, Mar; Gutierrez-Angel, Sara; Hartl, Christina A.; Gable, Annika L.; Maceli, Ashley R.; Erard, Nicolas; Williams, Alissa M.; Kim, Sun Y.; Dickopf, Steffen; Hannon, Gregory J.; Knott, Simon R.

Here we identify a key role for serine and glycine metabolism in the survival of brain cancer cells within the ischaemic zones of gliomas. Inhuman glioblastoma multiforme, mitochondrial serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT2) and glycine decarboxylase (GLDC) are highly expressed in the pseudopalisading cells that surround necrotic foci. We find that SHMT2 activity limits that of pyruvate kinase (PKM2) and reduces oxygen consumption, eliciting a metabolic state that confers a profound survival advantage to cells in poorly vascularized tumour regions. GLDC inhibition impairs cells with high SHMT2 levels as the excess glycine not metabolized by GLDC can be converted to the toxic molecules aminoacetone and methylglyoxal. Thus, SHMT2 is required for cancer cells to adapt to the tumour environment, but also renders these cells sensitive to glycine cleavage system inhibition.","[Kim, Dohoon; Birsoy, Kivanc; Freinkman, Elizaveta; Possemato, Richard L.; Chudnovsky, Yakov; Pacold, Michael E.; Chen, Walter W.; Cantor, Jason R.; Kwon, Manjae; Kang, Seong Woo; Sabatini, David M.] Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Kim, Dohoon; Birsoy, Kivanc; Freinkman, Elizaveta; Possemato, Richard L.; Chudnovsky, Yakov; Pacold, Michael E.; Chen, Walter W.; Cantor, Jason R.; Kang, Seong Woo; Sabatini, David M.] MIT, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Kim, Dohoon; Birsoy, Kivanc; Freinkman, Elizaveta; Possemato, Richard L.; Chudnovsky, Yakov; Pacold, Michael E.; Chen, Walter W.; Cantor, Jason R.; Kwon, Manjae; Kang, Seong Woo; Sabatini, David M.] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Kim, Dohoon; Fiske, Brian P.; Birsoy, Kivanc; Freinkman, Elizaveta; Possemato, Richard L.; Chudnovsky, Yakov; Pacold, Michael E.; Chen, Walter W.; Cantor, Jason R.; Gui, Dan Y.; Kang, Seong Woo; Vander Heiden, Matthew G.; Sabatini, David M.] MIT, David H Koch Inst Integrat Canc Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Kim, Dohoon; Fiske, Brian P.; Birsoy, Kivanc; Freinkman, Elizaveta; Possemato, Richard L.; Chudnovsky, Yakov; Pacold, Michael E.; Chen, Walter W.; Cantor, Jason R.; Gui, Dan Y.; Kang, Seong Woo; Vander Heiden, Matthew G.; Sabatini, David M.] Broad Inst Harvard & MIT, Seven Cambridge Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Kami, Kenjiro] Human Metabolome Technol Inc, Tsuruoka, Yamagata 9970052, Japan; [Pacold, Michael E.; Ramkissoon, Shakti H.; Ligon, Keith L.; Vander Heiden, Matthew G.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Shelton, Laura M.] Human Metabolome Technol Ameri Inc, Boston, MA 02134 USA; [Ramkissoon, Shakti H.; Ligon, Keith L.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Ramkissoon, Shakti H.; Ligon, Keith L.] Boston Childrens Hosp, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Snuderl, Matija] NYU, Langone Med Ctr, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Snuderl, Matija] NYU, Sch Med, New York, NY 10016 USA","Sabatini, DM (reprint author), Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, 9 Cambridge Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",sabatini@wi.mit.edu,,"Chen, Walter/0000-0002-7752-9581; /0000-0002-1446-7256; Possemato, Richard/0000-0002-2401-0030; Snuderl, Matija/0000-0003-0752-0917","Basic Research Fellowship from the American Brain Tumor Association; MIT School of Science Fellowship in Cancer Research; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [T32GM007287, K99 CA168940, K08-NS087118, R01CA168653, 5P30CA14051]; Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund; Leukemia and Lymphoma Society; American Cancer Society; American Brain Tumor Association Discovery Grant; US National Institute of Aging; Smith Family Foundation; Burroughs Wellcome Fund; Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation; Stern family; DOD CDMRP Discovery Award; David H.

Here we show that targeted therapy with BRAF, ALK or EGFR kinase inhibitors induces a complex network of secreted signals in drug-stressed human and mouse melanoma and human lung adenocarcinoma cells. This therapy-induced secretome stimulates the outgrowth, dissemination and metastasis of drug-resistant cancer cell clones and supports the survival of drug-sensitive cancer cells, contributing to incomplete tumour regression. The tumour-promoting secretome of melanoma cells treated with the kinase inhibitor vemurafenib is driven by down-regulation of the transcription factor FRA1. In situ transcriptome analysis of drug-resistant melanoma cells responding to the regressing tumour microenvironment revealed hyperactivation of several signalling pathways, most prominently the AKT pathway. Dual inhibition of RAF and the PI(3) K/AKT/mTOR intracellular signalling pathways blunted the outgrowth of the drug-resistant cell population in BRAF mutant human melanoma, suggesting this combination therapy as a strategy against tumour relapse. Thus, therapeutic inhibition of oncogenic drivers induces vast secretome changes in drug-sensitive cancer cells, paradoxically establishing a tumour microenvironment that supports the expansion of drug-resistant clones, but is susceptible to combination therapy.","[Obenauf, Anna C.; Zou, Yilong; Ji, Andrew L.; Vanharanta, Sakari; Shu, Weiping; Massague, Joan] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Canc Biol & Genet Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Zou, Yilong] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Gerstner Sloan Kettering Sch Biomed Sci, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Vanharanta, Sakari] Univ Cambridge, MRC Canc Unit, Cambridge CB2 0XZ, England; [Shi, Hubing; Kong, Xiangju; Lo, Roger S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Med, Div Dermatol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Shi, Hubing; Kong, Xiangju; Lo, Roger S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Jonsson Comprehens Canc Ctr, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Bosenberg, Marcus C.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Bosenberg, Marcus C.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Dermatol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Wiesner, Thomas] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Human Oncol & Pathogenesis Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Rosen, Neal] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Mol Pharmacol & Chem Program, New York, NY 10065 USA","Massague, J (reprint author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Canc Biol & Genet Program, New York, NY 10065 USA.",j-massague@ski.mskcc.org,,"Wiesner, Thomas/0000-0001-5877-2992; Massague, Joan/0000-0001-9324-8408","AACR [SU2C]; MSK Metastasis Research Center; NIH [CA163167, CA129243]; Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program of the Department of Defense; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Cancer Center [P30 CA008748]; Erwin Schroedinger Fellowship (FWF, Austrian Science Fund) [J3013]; Medical Research Council","We thank members of the Massague laboratory for discussions; L.

This raises fundamental questions about mechanisms of non-redundancy and resistance. Here we report major tumour regressions in a subset of patients with metastatic melanoma treated with an anti-CTLA4 antibody (anti-CTLA4) and radiation, and reproduced this effect in mouse models. Although combined treatment improved responses in irradiated and unirradiated tumours, resistance was common. Unbiased analyses of mice revealed that resistance was due to upregulation of PD-L1 on melanoma cells and associated with T-cell exhaustion. Accordingly, optimal response in melanoma and other cancer types requires radiation, anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD-L1/PD-1. Anti-CTLA4 predominantly inhibits T-regulatory cells (T-reg cells), thereby increasing theCD8T-cell to T-reg (CD8/T-reg) ratio. Radiation enhances the diversity of the T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire of intratumoral T cells. Together, anti-CTLA4 promotes expansion of T cells, while radiation shapes the TCR repertoire of the expanded peripheral clones. Addition of PD-L1 blockade reverses T-cell exhaustion to mitigate depression in the CD8/T-reg ratio and further encourages oligoclonal T-cell expansion. Similarly to results from mice, patients on our clinical trial with melanoma showing high PD-L1 did not respond to radiation plus anti-CTLA4, demonstrated persistent T-cell exhaustion, and rapidly progressed. Thus, PD-L1 on melanoma cells allows tumours to escape anti-CTLA4-based therapy, and the combination of radiation, anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD-L1 promotes response and immunity through distinct mechanisms.","[Twyman-Saint Victor, Christina; Herati, Ramin S.; Amaravadi, Ravi K.; Schuchter, Lynn M.; Gangadhar, Tara C.; Vonderheide, Robert H.] Univ Penn, Dept Med, Perelman Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Twyman-Saint Victor, Christina; Rech, Andrew J.; Benci, Joseph L.; Xu, Bihui; Dada, Hannah; Vonderheide, Robert H.; Minn, Andy J.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Abramson Family Canc Res Inst, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Maity, Amit; Rengan, Ramesh; Benci, Joseph L.; Xu, Bihui; Dada, Hannah; Patsch, Dana; Hahn, Stephen M.; Minn, Andy J.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Dept Radiat Oncol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Maity, Amit; Rengan, Ramesh; Amaravadi, Ravi K.; Schuchter, Lynn M.; Mick, Rosemarie; Pryma, Daniel A.; Xu, Xiaowei; Feldman, Michael D.; Gangadhar, Tara C.; Hahn, Stephen M.; Wherry, E.

Among the Apicomplexa phylum of obligate intracellular parasites, which cause veterinary and human diseases, Theileria is the only genus that transforms its mammalian host cells(1). Theileria infection of bovine leukocytes induces proliferative and invasive phenotypes associated with activated signalling pathways, notably JNK and AP-1 (ref. 2). The transformed phenotypes are reversed by treatment with the theilericidal drug buparvaquone(3). We used comparative genomics to identify a homologue of the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase PIN1 in T. annulata (TaPIN1) that is secreted into the host cell and modulates oncogenic signalling pathways. Here we show that TaPIN1 is a bona fide prolyl isomerase and that it interacts with the host ubiquitin ligase FBW7, leading to its degradation and subsequent stabilization of c-JUN, which promotes transformation. We performed in vitro and in silico analysis and in vivo zebrafish xenograft experiments to demonstrate that TaPIN1 is directly inhibited by the anti-parasite drug buparvaquone (and other known PIN1 inhibitors) and is mutated in a drug-resistant strain. Prolyl isomerization is thus a conserved mechanism that is important in cancer and is used by Theileria parasites to manipulate host oncogenic signalling.","[Marsolier, J.; Perichon, M.; Fritsch, L.; Ait-Si-Ali, S.; Medjkane, S.; Weitzman, J.

The structurally and stereochemically diverse peptides generated in this manner underlie the biosynthesis of a large sector of natural products. Many of their derived metabolites are bioactive such as the antibiotics vancomycin, bacitracin, daptomycin and the beta-lactam-containing penicillins, cephalosporins andnocardicins. Penicillins and cephalosporins are synthesized from a classically derived non-ribosomal peptide synthetase tripeptide (from delta-(L-alpha-aminoadipyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine synthetase)(2). Here we report an unprecedented non-ribosomal peptide synthetase activity that both assembles a serine-containing peptide and mediates its cyclization to the critical beta-lactamring of the nocardicin family of antibiotics. A histidine-rich condensation domain, which typically performs peptide bond formation during product assembly, also synthesizes the embedded four-membered ring. We propose a mechanism, and describe supporting experiments, that is distinct from the pathways that have evolved to the three other beta-lactam antibiotic families: penicillin/cephalosporins, clavams and carbapenems.

Here we show that different motor learning tasks induce dendritic Ca2+ spikes on different apical tuft branches of individual layer V pyramidal neurons in the mouse motor cortex . These ask-related, branch-specific Ca2+ spikes cause long-lasting potentiation of postsynaptic dendritic spines active at the time of spike generation. When somatostatin-expressing interneurons are inactivated, different motor tasks frequently induce Ca2+ spikes on the same branches. On those branches, spines potentiated during one task are depotentiated when they are active seconds before Ca2+ spikes induced by another task. Concomitantly, increased neuronal activity and performance improvement after learning one task are disrupted when another task is learned.

Here we report that endothelial loss of CFT1A, a rate-limiting enzyme of fatty acid oxidation (FAO), causes vascular sprouting defects due to impaired proliferation, not migration, of human and murine endothelial cells. Reduction of FAO in endothelial cells did not cause energy depletion or disturb redox homeostasis, but impaired de novo nucleotide synthesis for DNA replication. Isotope labelling studies in control endothelial cells showed that fatty acid carbons substantially replenished the Krebs cycle, and were incorporated into aspartate (a nucleotide precursor), uridine monophosphate (a precursor of pyrimidine nucleoside triphosphates) and DNA. CPT1A silencing reduced these processes and depleted endothelial cell stores of aspartate and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. Acetate (metabolized to acetyl-CoA, thereby substituting for the depleted FAO-derived acetyl-CoA) or a nucleoside mix rescued the phenotype of CPT1A-silenceil endothelial cells.

Bombardment brought these organics to the young Earth's surface(1). Unlike asteroids, comets preserve a nearly pristine record of the solar nebula composition. The presence of cyanides in comets, including 0.01 per cent of methyl cyanide (CH3CN) with respect to water, is of special interest because of the importance of C-N bonds for abiotic amino acid synthesis(2). Comet-like compositions of simple and complex volatiles are found in protostars, and can readily be explained by a combination of gas-phase chemistry (to form, for example, HCN) and an active ice-phase chemistry on grain surfaces that advances complexity(3). Simple volatiles, including water and HCN, have been detected previously in solar nebula analogues, indicating that they survive disk formation or are re-formed in situ(4-7). It has hitherto been unclear whether the same holds for more complex organic molecules outside the solar nebula, given that recent observations show a marked change in the chemistry at the boundary between nascent envelopes and young disks due to accretion shocks(8). Here we report the detection of the complex cyanides CH3CN and HC3N (and HCN) in the protoplanetary disk around the young star MWC 480. We find that the abundance ratios of these nitrogen-bearing organics in the gas phase are similar to those in comets, which suggests an even higher relative abundance of complex cyanides in the disk ice. This implies that complex organics accompany simpler volatiles in protoplanetary disks, and that the rich organic chemistry of our solar nebula was not unique.","[Oeberg, Karin I.; Guzman, Viviana V.; Qi, Chunhua; Andrews, Sean M.; Loomis, Ryan; Wilner, David J.] Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Furuya, Kenji] Leiden Univ, Leiden Observ, NL-2300 CA Leiden, Netherlands; [Aikawa, Yuri] Kobe Univ, Nada Ward, Kobe, Hyogo 6570013, Japan","Oberg, KI (reprint author), Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, 60 Garden St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",koberg@cfa.harvard.edu,"guzman, viviana/C-6328-2015","guzman, viviana/0000-0003-4784-3040",Simons Collaboration on the Origins of Life (SCOL); Alfred P.

The period was previously determined from radio measurements by the Voyager spacecraft to be 10 h 39 min 22.4s (ref. 2). When the Cassini spacecraft measured a period of 10 h 47 min 6s, which was additionally found to change between sequential measurements(3,4,5), it became clear that the radio period could not be used to determine the bulk planetary rotation period. Estimates based upon Saturn's measured wind fields have increased the uncertainty even more, giving numbers smaller than the Voyager rotation period, and at present Saturn's rotation period is thought to be between 10 h 32 mm and 10 h 47 min, which is unsatisfactory for such a fundamental property. Here we report a period of 10 h 32 mm 45 s 46 s, based upon an optimization approach using Saturn's measured gravitational field and limits on the observed shape and possible internal density profiles. Moreover, even when solely using the constraints from its gravitational field, the rotation period can be inferred with a precision of several minutes. To validate our method, we applied the same procedure to Jupiter and correctly recovered its well-known rotation period.","[Helled, Ravit] Tel Aviv Univ, Raymond & Beverly Sackler Fac Exact Sci, Dept Geosci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Galanti, Eli; Kaspi, Yohai] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel","Helled, R (reprint author), Tel Aviv Univ, Raymond & Beverly Sackler Fac Exact Sci, Dept Geosci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",rhelled@post.tau.ac.il,,"Helled, Ravit/0000-0001-5555-2652","Israel Space Agency [3-11485, 3-11481]","We thank G.

The coherent and multi-wave nature of the FWM approach has been crucial in the development of advanced technologies, such as silicon photonice, subwavelength imaging' and quantum communications(10). All these technologies operate at optical wavelengths, which limits the spatial resolution and does not allow the probing of excitations with energy in the electronvolt range. Extension to shorter wavelengths that is, the extreme ultraviolet and soft-X-ray ranges would allow the spatial resolution to be improved and the excitation energy range to be expanded, as well as enabling elemental selectivity to be achieved by exploiting core resonances(5-7,11-14). So far, FWM applications at such wavelengths have been prevented by the absence of coherent sources of sufficient brightness and of suitable experimental set-ups. Here we show how transient gratings, generated by the interference of coherent extreme-ultraviolet pulses delivered by the FERMI free-electron laser(15), can be used to stimulate FWM processes at suboptical wavelengths. Furthermore, we have demonstrated the possibility of observing the time evolution of the FWM signal, which shows the dynamics of coherent excitations as molecular vibrations. This result opens the way to FWM with nanometre spatial resolution and elemental selectivity, which, for example, would enable the investigation of charge-transfer dynamics(5-7). The theoretical possibility of realizing these applications has already stimulated ongoing developments of free-electron lasers(16-20): our results show that FWM at suboptical wavelengths is feasible, and we hope that they will enable advances in present and future photon sources.","[Bencivenga, F.; Cucini, R.; Capotondi, F.; Battistoni, A.; Mincigrucci, R.; Giangrisostomi, E.; Gessini, A.; Manfredda, M.; Nikolov, I.

Relativistic effects influence the electronic structure of heavy elements in the sixth row of the periodic table, and these effects increase dramatically in the seventh row including the actinides even affecting ground-state configurations(1,2). Atomic s and p(1/2) orbitals are stabilized by relativistic effects, whereas p(3/2), d and f orbitals are destabilized, so that ground-state configurations of heavy elements may differ from those of lighter elements in the same group. The first ionization potential (IP1) is a measure of the energy required to remove one valence electron from a neutral atom, and is an atomic property that reflects the outermost electronic configuration. Precise and accurate experimental determination of IP1 gives information on the binding energy of valence electrons, and also, therefore, on the degree of relativistic stabilization. However, such measurements are hampered by the difficulty in obtaining the heaviest elements on scales of more than one atom at a time(3-5). Here we report that the experimentally obtained IP1 of the heaviest actinide, lawrencium (Lr, atomic number 103), is 4.96(-0.07)(+0.08) electronvolts. The IP1 of Lr was measured with Lr-256. (half-life 27 seconds) using an efficient surface ion-source and a radioisotope detection system coupled to a mass separator. The measured IP1 is in excellent agreement with the value of 4.963(15) electronvolts predicted here by state-of-the-art relativistic calculations. The present work provides a reliable benchmark for theoretical calculations and also opens the way for IP1 measurements of superheavy elements (that is, transactinides) on an atom-at-a-time scale.","[Sato, T.

Simulations show that most of the material that eventually aggregates to form the Moon originates from the impactor(1,4,5). However, analysis of the terrestrial and lunar isotopic compositions show them to be highly similar(6-11). In contrast, the compositions of other Solar System bodies are significantly different from those of the Earth and Moon(12-14), suggesting that different Solar System bodies have distinct compositions. This challenges the giant impact scenario, because the Moon-forming impactor must then also be thought to have a composition different from that of the proto-Earth. Here we track the feeding zones of growing planets in a suite of simulations of planetary accretion(15), to measure the composition of Moon-forming impactors. We find that different planets formed in the same simulation have distinct compositions, but the compositions of giant impactors are statistically more similar to the planets they impact. A large fraction of planet-impactor pairs have almost identical compositions. Thus, the similarity in composition between the Earth and Moon could be a natural consequence of a late giant impact.","[Mastrobuono-Battisti, Alessandra; Perets, Hagai B.] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Dept Phys, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel; [Raymond, Sean N.] CNRS, Lab Astrophys Bordeaux, UMR 5804, F-33270 Floirac, France; [Raymond, Sean N.] Univ Bordeaux, Lab Astrophys Bordeaux, UMR 5804, F-33270 Floirac, France","Mastrobuono-Battisti, A (reprint author), Technion Israel Inst Technol, Dept Phys, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel.",amastrobuono@physics.technion.ac.il; hperets@physics.technion.ac.il,"Perets, Hagai/K-9605-2015","Perets, Hagai/0000-0002-5004-199X; Mastrobuono-Battisti, Alessandra/0000-0002-2386-9142",BSF [2012384]; Minerva Center for Life under Extreme Planetary Conditions; ISF I-CORE [1829/12]; Marie Curie IRG [333644 'GRAND']; Agence Nationale pour la Recherche [ANR-13-BS05-0003-002],"H.B.P. acknowledges support from BSF grant number 2012384, the Minerva Center for Life under Extreme Planetary Conditions, the ISF I-CORE grant number 1829/12 and the Marie Curie IRG 333644 'GRAND' grant S.N.R. acknowledges funding from the Agence Nationale pour la Recherche via grant ANR-13-BS05-0003-002 (project MOJO).

Owing to the scarcity of human fossils from this period, these ancestors of all present-day non-African modern populations remain largely enigmatic. Here we describe a partial calvaria, recently discovered at Manot Cave (Western Galilee, Israel) and dated to 54.7 +/- 5.5 kyr BP (arithmetic mean 2 standard deviations) by uranium-thorium dating, that sheds light on this crucial event. The overall shape and discrete morphological features of the Manot I calvaria demonstrate that this partial skull is unequivocally modern. It is similar in shape to recent African skulls as well as to European skulls from the Upper Palaeolithic period, but different from most other early anatomically modern humans in the Levant. This suggests that the Manot people could be closely related to the first modern humans who later successfully colonized Europe. Thus, the anatomical features used to support the 'assimilation model' in Europe might not have been inherited from European Neanderthals, but rather from earlier Levantine populations. Moreover, at present, Manot I is the only modern human specimen to provide evidence that during the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic interface, both modern humans and Neanderthals contemporaneously inhabited the southern Levant, close in time to the likely interbreeding event with Neanderthals(2,3).","[Hershkovitz, Israel; Slon, Viviane] Tel Aviv Univ, Sackler Fac Med, Dan David Lab Search & Study Modern Humans, IL-6997801 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Hershkovitz, Israel; Mayer, Daniella Bar-Yosef; May, Hila] Tel Aviv Univ, Steinhardt Museum Nat Hist & Natl Res Ctr, IL-6997801 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Marder, Ofer] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Archaeol Div, IL-8410501 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Ayalon, Avner; Bar-Matthews, Miryam; Yasur, Gal] Geol Survey Israel, IL-95501 Jerusalem, Israel; [Boaretto, Elisabetta; Caracuta, Valentina; Alex, Bridget] Weizmann Inst Sci, D REAMS Radiocarbon Lab, Max Planck Soc Weizmann Inst Ctr Integrat Archaeo, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Alex, Bridget] Harvard Univ, Dept Anthropol & Human Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Frumkin, Amos] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Geog, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel; [Goder-Goldberger, Mae] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Inst Archaeol, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel; [Gunz, Philipp] Max Planck Inst Evolutionare Anthropol, Dept Human Evolut, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Holloway, Ralph L.] Columbia Univ, Dept Anthropol, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Latimer, Bruce] Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Anat, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Latimer, Bruce; Hans, Mark G.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Sch Dent Med, Dept Orthodont, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Matthews, Alan; Bar-Oz, Guy; Yeshurun, Reuven] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Inst Earth Sci, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel; [Berna, Francesco] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Archaeol, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Bar-Oz, Guy; Yeshurun, Reuven] Univ Haifa, Zinman Inst Archaeol, IL-3498838 Haifa, Israel; [May, Hila] Tel Aviv Univ, Sackler Fac Med, Dept Anat & Anthropol, IL-6997801 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Weber, Gerhard W.] Univ Vienna, Dept Anthropol, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Weber, Gerhard W.] Univ Vienna, Core Facil Microcomp Tomog, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Barzilai, Omry] Israel Antiqu Author, IL-91004 Jerusalem, Israel","Hershkovitz, I (reprint author), Tel Aviv Univ, Sackler Fac Med, Dan David Lab Search & Study Modern Humans, POB 39040, IL-6997801 Tel Aviv, Israel.",anatom2@post.tau.ac.il,"Weber, Gerhard/F-2583-2010; Gunz, Philipp/C-7748-2009","Weber, Gerhard/0000-0002-8542-6259; Gunz, Philipp/0000-0002-2350-4450; Yeshurun, Reuven/0000-0002-1734-0138",Dan David Foundation; Israel Antiquities Authority; Case Western Reserve University; Leakey Foundation; Irene Levi Sala CARE Archaeological Foundation; Keren Kayemet L'Israel; Israel Science Foundation; National Science Foundation; Exilarch's Foundation; Max Planck Society-Weizman Institute Joint Center for Integrative Archaeology and Anthropology; Bertha and Louis Weinstein Research Fund,"The excavation at Manot Cave was initiated and supported throughout the years by the late D.

Here we develop a generalizable method to measure tuning curves that specify the relationship between neural responses and mentally accumulated evidence, and apply it to distinguish the encoding of decision variables in posterior parietal cortex and prefrontal cortex (frontal orienting fields, FOF). We recorded the firing rates of neurons in posterior parietal cortex and FOF from rats performing a perceptual decision-making task. Classical analyses uncovered correlates of accumulating evidence, similar to previous observations in primates and also similar across the two regions. However, tuning curve assays revealed that while the posterior parietal cortex encodes a graded value of the accumulating evidence, the FOF has a more categorical encoding that indicates, throughout the trial, the decision provisionally favoured by the evidence accumulated so far. Contrary to current views(3,5,7,9), this suggests that premotor activity in the frontal cortex does not have a role in the accumulation process, but instead has a more categorical function, such as transforming accumulated evidence into a discrete choice. To probe causally the role of FOF activity, we optogenetically silenced it during different time points of the trial. Consistent with a role in committing to a categorical choice at the end of the evidence accumulation process, but not consistent with a role during the accumulation itself, a behavioural effect was observed only when FOF silencing occurred at the end of the perceptual stimulus. Our results place important constraints on the circuit logic of brain regions involved in decision-making.","[Hanks, Timothy D.; Kopec, Charles D.; Brunton, Bingni W.; Duan, Chunyu A.; Erlich, Jeffrey C.; Brody, Carlos D.] Princeton Univ, Princeton Neurosci Inst, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Hanks, Timothy D.; Kopec, Charles D.; Brunton, Bingni W.; Duan, Chunyu A.; Erlich, Jeffrey C.; Brody, Carlos D.] Princeton Univ, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Brunton, Bingni W.] Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98105 USA; [Brunton, Bingni W.] Univ Washington, Dept Appl Math, Seattle, WA 98105 USA; [Erlich, Jeffrey C.] NYU Shanghai, NYU ECNU Inst Brain & Cognit Sci, Shanghai 200122, Peoples R China; [Brody, Carlos D.] Princeton Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Brody, CD (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Princeton Neurosci Inst, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",brody@princeton.edu,,"Erlich, Jeffrey/0000-0001-9073-7986",National Institutes of Health (NIH) [F32MH098572]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NIH [T32MH065214],"We thank K.

Subcortical brain regions form circuits with cortical areas to coordinate movement(2), learning, memory(3) and motivation(4), and altered circuits can lead to abnormal behaviour and disease(5). To investigate how common genetic variants affect the structure of these brain regions, here we conduct genome-wide association studies of the volumes of seven subcortical regions and the intracranial volume derived from magnetic resonance images of 30,717 individuals from 50 cohorts. We identify five novel genetic variants influencing the volumes of the putamen and caudate nucleus. We also find stronger evidence for three loci with previously established influences on hippocampal volume(5) and intracranial volume(6). These variants show specific volumetric effects on brain structures rather than global effects across structures. The strongest effects were found for the putamen, where a novel intergenic locus with replicable influence on volume (rs945270; P = 1.08 X 10(-33); 0.52% variance explained) showed evidence of altering the expression of the KTN1 gene in both brain and blood tissue. Variants influencing putamen volume clustered near developmental genes that regulate apoptosis, axon guidance and vesicle transport. Identification of these genetic variants provides insight into the causes of variability in human brain development, and may help to determine mechanisms of neuropsychiatric dysfunction.","[Hibar, Derrek P.; Stein, Jason L.; Jahanshad, Neda; Ching, Christopher R.

Whether the basis of this risk resides with the mother or oocyte is unknown. The impact of maternal age on congenital heart disease can be modelled in mouse pups that harbour a mutation of the cardiac transcription factor gene Nkx2-5 (ref. 8). Here, reciprocal ovarian transplants between young and old mothers establish a maternal basis for the age-associated risk in mice. A high-fat diet does not accelerate the effect of maternal ageing, so hyperglycaemia and obesity do not simply explain the mechanism. The age-associated risk varies with the mother's strain background, making it a quantitative genetic trait. Most remarkably, voluntary exercise, whether begun by mothers at a young age or later in life, can mitigate the risk when they are older. Thus, even when the offspring carry a causal mutation, an intervention aimed at the mother can meaningfully reduce their risk of congenital heart disease.","[Schulkey, Claire E.; Regmi, Suk D.; Magnan, Rachel A.; Danzo, Megan T.; Luther, Herman; Hutchinson, Alayna K.; Panzer, Adam A.; Grady, Mary M.; Wilson, David B.; Jay, Patrick Y.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Wilson, David B.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Dev Biol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Jay, Patrick Y.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, St Louis, MO 63110 USA","Jay, PY (reprint author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.",jay_p@kids.wustl.edu,,,"Ruth L.

One function of such sites is to enable dephosphorylation of the cytosolic tails of endosomal signalling receptors by an ER-associated phosphatase(4), whereas others serve to negatively control the association of endosomes with the minus-end-directed microtubule motor dynein(5) or mediate endosome fission(6). Cholesterol transfer and Ca2+ exchange have been proposed as additional functions of such sites(2,3). However, the compositions, activities and regulations of ER-endosome contact sites remain incompletely understood. Here we show in human and rat cell lines that protrudin, an ER protein that promotes protrusion and neurite outgrowth(7), forms contact sites with late endosomes (LEs) via coincident detection of the small GTPase RAB7 and phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P). These contact sites mediate transfer of the microtubule motor kinesin 1 fromprotrudin to the motor adaptor FYCO1 on LEs. Repeated LE-ER contacts promote microtubule-dependent translocation of LEs to the cell periphery and subsequent synaptotagmin-VII-dependent fusion with the plasma membrane. Such fusion induces outgrowth of protrusions and neurites, which requires the abilities of protrudin and FYCO1 to interact with LEs and kinesin 1. Thus, protrudin-containing ER-LE contact sites are platforms for kinesin-1 loading onto LEs, and kinesin-1-mediated translocation of LEs to the plasma membrane, fuelled by repeated ER contacts, promotes protrusion and neurite outgrowth.","[Raiborg, Camilla; Wenzel, Eva M.; Pedersen, Nina M.; Schink, Kay O.; Schultz, Sebastian W.; Vietri, Marina; Brech, Andreas; Stenmark, Harald] Univ Oslo, Fac Med, Ctr Canc Biomed, N-0379 Oslo, Norway; [Raiborg, Camilla; Wenzel, Eva M.; Pedersen, Nina M.; Schink, Kay O.; Schultz, Sebastian W.; Vietri, Marina; Brech, Andreas; Stenmark, Harald] Oslo Univ Hosp, Inst Canc Res, Dept Mol Cell Biol, N-0379 Oslo, Norway; [Olsvik, Hallvard; Johansen, Terje] Univ Tromso, Inst Med Biol, N-9037 Tromso, Norway; [Nisi, Veronica; Bucci, Cecilia] Univ Salento, Dept Biol & Environm Sci & Technol DiSTeBA, I-73100 Lecce, Italy","Raiborg, C (reprint author), Univ Oslo, Fac Med, Ctr Canc Biomed, N-0379 Oslo, Norway.",camilla.raiborg@rr-research.no; stenmark@ulrik.uio.no,"Johansen, Terje/N-2971-2015; Bucci, Cecilia/F-6699-2012","Johansen, Terje/0000-0003-1451-9578; Wenzel, Eva Maria/0000-0002-5561-3344; Bucci, Cecilia/0000-0002-6232-6183; Olsvik, Hallvard/0000-0003-3489-7461; Schink, Kay Oliver/0000-0002-5903-4059",Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro [14709]; Telethon-Italy [GGP09145]; MIUR (PRIN); Norwegian Research Council [196898]; Norwegian Cancer Society [71043-PR-2006-0320]; European Research Council; Research Council of Norway through its Centres of Excellence funding scheme [179571],"We thank A.

Chemotherapies such as the topoisomerase II (TopoII) inhibitor etoposide effectively reduce disease in a minority of patients with this cancer(2,3); therefore, alternative drug targets, including epigenetic enzymes, are under consideration for therapeutic intervention(4). A promising potential epigenetic target is the methyltransferase EZH2, which in the context of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is well known to tri-methylate histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and elicit gene silencing(5). Here we demonstrate that EZH2 inhibition has differential effects on the TopoII inhibitor response of non-small-cell lung cancers in vitro and in vivo. EGFR and BRG1 mutations are genetic biomarkers that predict enhanced sensitivity to TopoII inhibitor in response to EZH2 inhibition. BRG1 loss-of-function mutant tumours respond to EZH2 inhibition with increased S phase, anaphase bridging, apoptosis and TopoII inhibitor sensitivity. Conversely, EGFR and BRG1 wild-type tumours upregulate BRG1 in response to EZH2 inhibition and ultimately become more resistant to TopoII inhibitor. EGFR gain-of-function mutant tumours are also sensitive to dual EZH2 inhibition and TopoII inhibitor, because of genetic antagonism between EGFR and BRG1. These findings suggest an opportunity for precision medicine in the genetically complex disease of non-small-cell lung cancer.","[Fillmore, Christine M.; Desai, Pooja T.; Berry, Joanne M.; Rowbotham, Samuel P.; Kim, Carla F.] Boston Childrens Hosp, Stem Cell Program, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Fillmore, Christine M.; Rowbotham, Samuel P.; Lin, Yi-Jang; Kim, Carla F.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA USA; [Fillmore, Christine M.; Rowbotham, Samuel P.; Kim, Carla F.] Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Xu, Chunxiao; Zhang, Haikuo; Hammerman, Peter S.; Wong, Kwok-Kin] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Xu, Chunxiao; Zhang, Haikuo; Wong, Kwok-Kin] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Belfer Inst Appl Canc Sci, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Marquez, Victor E.] NCI, Biol Chem Lab, NIH, Frederick, MD 21702 USA","Kim, CF (reprint author), Boston Childrens Hosp, Stem Cell Program, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",carla.kim@childrens.harvard.edu,,"Brainson, Christine/0000-0002-0854-5043; wong, kwok kin/0000-0001-6323-235X","Ladies Auxiliary to the Veterans of Foreign Wars; American Cancer Society [PF-12-151-01-DMC]; Uniting Against Lung Cancer Young Investigator Award; Boston University Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program; American Cancer Society Research Scholar Grant [RSG-08-082-01-MGO]; V Foundation for Cancer Research; Basil O'Conner March of Dimes Starter Award; Harvard Stem Cell Institute; Lung Cancer Research Foundation; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [CA122794, CA140594, CA163896, CA166480, CA154303, CA120964]; Intramural Research Program of the NIH, National Cancer Institute, Center for Cancer Research; NIH [K08 CA163677];  [RO1 HL090136];  [U01 HL100402 RFA-HL-09-004]","We thank the Kim laboratory, F.

Establishment of DNA methylation is mediated by the de novo DNA methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B, whereas DNMT1 ensures maintenance of methylation through replication(1). Absence of these enzymes is lethal(2), and somatic mutations in these genes have been associated with several human diseases(3,4). How genomic DNA methylation patterns are regulated remains poorly understood, as the mechanisms that guide recruitment and activity of DNMTs in vivo are largely unknown. To gain insights into this matter we determined genomic binding and site-specific activity of the mammalian de novo DNA methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B. We show that both enzymes localize to methylated, CpG-dense regions in mouse stem cells, yet are excluded from active promoters and enhancers. By specifically measuring sites of de novo methylation, we observe that enzymatic activity reflects binding. De novo methylation increases with CpG density, yet is excluded from nudeosomes. Notably, we observed selective binding of DNMT3B to the bodies of transcribed genes, which leads to their preferential methylation. This targeting to transcribed sequences requires SETD2-mediated methylation of lysine 36 on histone H3 and a functional PWWP domain of DNMT3B. Together these findings reveal how sequence and chromatin cues guide de novo methyltransferase activity to ensure methylome integrity.","[Baubec, Tuncay; Colombo, Daniele F.; Wirbelauer, Christiane; Schmidt, Juliane; Burger, Lukas; Krebs, Arnaud R.; Akalin, Altuna; Schuebeler, Dirk] Friedrich Miescher Inst Biomed Res, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland; [Burger, Lukas] Swiss Inst Bioinformat, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland; [Schuebeler, Dirk] Univ Basel, Fac Sci, CH-4001 Basel, Switzerland","Baubec, T (reprint author), Friedrich Miescher Inst Biomed Res, Maulbeerstr 66, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland.",tuncay.baubec@fmi.ch; dirk@fmi.ch,"Baubec, Tuncay/J-3719-2014","Baubec, Tuncay/0000-0001-8474-6587; Colombo, Daniele/0000-0003-1985-4551; AKALIN, ALTUNA/0000-0002-0468-0117; Krebs, Arnaud/0000-0001-7999-6127","Novartis Research Foundation; European Union (NoE ""EpiGeneSys"") [FP7- HEALTH-2010-257082]; European Union (""Blueprint"" consortium) [FP7-282510]; European Research Council (EpiGePlas); SNF Sinergia program; Swiss initiative in Systems Biology (RTD Cell Plasticity); Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds; EMBO postdoctoral long-term fellowships","We are grateful to S.

Silencing is initiated when the enzyme Dicer processes the double-stranded RNA into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Small RNA molecules are incorporated into Argonaute-protein-containing effector complexes, which they guide to complementary targets to mediate different types of gene silencing, specifically post-transcriptional gene silencing and chromatin-dependent gene silencing(1). Although endogenous small RNAs have crucial roles in chromatin-mediated processes across kingdoms, efforts to initiate chromatin modifications in trans by using siRNAs have been inherently difficult to achieve in all eukaryotic cells. Using fission yeast, here we show that RNAi-directed heterochromatin formation is negatively controlled by the highly conserved RNA polymerase-associated factor 1 complex (Paf1C). Temporary expression of a synthetic hairpin RNA in Paf1C mutants triggers stable heterochromatin formation at homologous loci, effectively silencing genes in trans. This repressed state is propagated across generations by the continual production of secondary siRNAs, independently of the synthetic hairpin RNA. Our data support a model in which Paf1C prevents targeting of nascent transcripts by the siRNA-containing RNA-induced transcriptional silencing complex and thereby epigenetic gene silencing, by promoting efficient transcription termination and rapid release of the RNA from the site of transcription. We show that although compromised transcription termination is sufficient to initiate the formation of bi-stable heterochromatin by trans-acting siRNAs, impairment of both transcription termination and nascent transcript release is imperative to confer stability to the repressed state. Our work uncovers a novel mechanism for small-RNA-mediated epigenome regulation and highlights fundamental roles for Paf1C and the RNAi machinery in building epigenetic memory.","[Kowalik, Katarzyna Maria; Shimada, Yukiko; Flury, Valentin; Stadler, Michael Beda; Buehler, Marc] Friedrich Miescher Inst Biomed Res, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland; [Kowalik, Katarzyna Maria; Shimada, Yukiko; Flury, Valentin; Stadler, Michael Beda; Buehler, Marc] Univ Basel, CH-4003 Basel, Switzerland; [Stadler, Michael Beda] Swiss Inst Bioinformat, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland; [Batki, Julia] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Fac Sci, Inst Chem, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary","Buhler, M (reprint author), Friedrich Miescher Inst Biomed Res, Maulbeerstr 66, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland.",marc.buehler@fmi.ch,,"Buehler, Marc/0000-0001-6661-9795; Flury, Valentin/0000-0003-0476-4940",Swiss National Science Foundation; European Research Council; Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds; Novartis Research Foundation,"We thank T.

How local ecological assemblages are responding is less clear-a concern given their importance for many ecosystem functions and services. We analysed a terrestrial assemblage database of unprecedented geographic and taxonomic coverage to quantify local biodiversity responses to land use and related changes. Here we show that in the worst-affected habitats, these pressures reducewithin-sample species richness by anaverage of 76.5%, total abundance by 39.5% andrarefaction-based richness by 40.3%. We estimate that, globally, these pressures have already slightly reduced average within-sample richness (by 13.6%), total abundance (10.7%) and rarefaction-based richness (8.1%), with changes showing marked spatial variation. Rapid further losses are predicted under a business-as-usual land-use scenario; within-sample richness is projected to fall by a further 3.4% globally by 2100, with losses concentrated in biodiverse but economically poor countries. Strongmitigationcan delivermuchmore positive biodiversity changes (up to a 1.9% average increase) that are less strongly related to countries' socioeconomic status.","[Newbold, Tim; Hill, Samantha L.

We hypothesize that deleterious variants at conserved residues are enriched in severely affected patients arising from female-enriched multiplex families with severe disease, enhancing the detection of key autism genes in modest numbers of cases. Here we show the use of this strategy by identifying missense and dosage sequence variants in the gene encoding the adhesive junction-associated delta-catenin protein (CTNND2) in female-enriched multiplex families and demonstrating their loss-of-function effect by functional analyses in zebrafish embryos and cultured hippocampal neurons from wild-type and Ctnnd2 null mouse embryos. Finally, through gene expression and network analyses, we highlight a critical role for CTNND2 in neuronal development and an intimate connection to chromatin biology. Our data contribute to the understanding of the genetic architecture of autism and suggest that genetic analyses of phenotypic extremes, such as female-enriched multiplex families, are of innate value in multifactorial disorders.","[Turner, Tychele N.; Sosa, Maria X.; Auer, Dallas R.; Pihur, Vasyl; Chakravarti, Aravinda] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Complex Dis Genom, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Turner, Tychele N.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, McKusick Nathans Inst Genet Med, Predoctoral Training Program Human Genet & Mol Bi, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Turner, Tychele N.; Sosa, Maria X.; Auer, Dallas R.; Sanders, Stephan J.; Moreno-De-Luca, Daniel; Pihur, Vasyl; Martin, Christa Lese; State, Matthew W.; Chakravarti, Aravinda] Univ Calif Los Angeles, NIMH, Autism Ctr Excellence ACE Genet Consortium, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Sharma, Kamal; Huganir, Richard] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Solomon H Snyder Dept Neurosci, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Oh, Edwin C.; Liu, Yangfan P.; Katsanis, Nicholas] Duke Univ, Ctr Human Dis Modeling, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Collins, Ryan L.; Brand, Harrison; Talkowski, Michael E.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Human Genet Res, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Collins, Ryan L.; Brand, Harrison; Talkowski, Michael E.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Brand, Harrison; Talkowski, Michael E.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Neurol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Sanders, Stephan J.; State, Matthew W.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Psychiat, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Moreno-De-Luca, Daniel] Yale Univ, Dept Psychiat, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Plona, Teri; Pike, Kristen; Soppet, Daniel R.] Leidos Biomed Res Inc, Frederick, MD 21702 USA; [Smith, Michael W.] NHGRI, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Cheung, Sau Wai] Baylor Coll Med, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Martin, Christa Lese] Geisinger Hlth Syst, Autism & Dev Med Inst, Lewisburg, PA 17837 USA; [Cook, Edwin] Univ Illinois, Chicago, IL 60608 USA","Chakravarti, A (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Complex Dis Genom, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",aravinda@jhmi.edu,,"Collins, Rachel/0000-0002-1559-8135; Katsanis, Nicholas/0000-0002-2480-0171","National Institute of Mental Health [1U24MH081810]; Simons Foundation; NIMH [MH095867, 5R25MH071584-07, MH19961-14, R01MH081754]; National Institutes of Health [RO1MH074090]; Autism Speaks Dennis Weatherstone pre-doctoral fellowship [7863]","We acknowledge the participation of all of the families in the AGRE, NIMH and SSC studies that have been amodel of public participatory research.

Here we show that p53 inhibits cystine uptake and sensitizes cells to ferroptosis, a non-apoptotic form of cell death, by repressing expression of SLC7A11, a key component of the cystine/glutamate antiporter. Notably, p53(3KR), an acetylation-defective mutant that fails to induce cell-cycle arrest, senescence and apoptosis, fully retains the ability to regulate SLC7A11 expression and induce ferroptosis upon reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced stress. Analysis of mutant mice shows that these non-canonical p53 activities contribute to embryonic development and the lethality associated with loss of Mdm2. Moreover, SLC7A11 is highly expressed in human tumours, and its overexpression inhibits ROS-induced ferroptosis and abrogates p53(3KR)-mediated tumour growth suppression in xenograft models. Our findings uncover a new mode of tumour suppression based on p53 regulation of cystine metabolism, ROS responses and ferroptosis.","[Jiang, Le; Kon, Ning; Li, Tongyuan; Wang, Shang-Jui; Baer, Richard; Gu, Wei] Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, Inst Canc Genet, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Su, Tao; Hibshoosh, Hanina; Baer, Richard; Gu, Wei] Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Pathol & Cell Biol, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Su, Tao; Hibshoosh, Hanina; Baer, Richard; Gu, Wei] Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, Herbert Irving Comprehens Canc Ctr, New York, NY 10032 USA","Gu, W (reprint author), Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, Inst Canc Genet, 1130 St Nicholas Ave, New York, NY 10032 USA.",wg8@columbia.edu,,,"National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health [5R01CA172023, 5RO1CA166294, 5RO1CA169246, 5RO1CA085533, 2P01CA080058]; National Cancer Institute [2P01CA097403]; NIH cancer biology training grant [T32-CA09503]","This work was supported by the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health under awards 5R01CA172023, 5RO1CA166294, 5RO1CA169246, 5RO1CA085533 and 2P01CA080058 to W.G.

Solid content assembles into ever-larger rocky fragments that eventually become planetary embryos. These then continue their growth by accreting leftover material in the disk. Concurrently, tidal effects in the disk cause a radial drift in the embryo orbits, a process known as migration(1-4). Fast inward migration is predicted by theory for embryos smaller than three to five Earth masses(5-7). With only inward migration, these embryos can only rarely become giant planets located at Earth's distance from the Sun and beyond(8,9), in contrast with observations(10). Here we report that asymmetries in the temperature rise associated with accreting infalling material(11,12) produce a force (which gives rise to an effect that we call 'heating torque') that counteracts inward migration. This provides a channel for the formation of giant planets(8) and also explains the strong planet-metallicity correlation found between the incidence of giant planets and the heavy-element abundance of the host stars(13,14).","[Benitez-Llambay, Pablo] Univ Nacl Cordoba, IATE, Observ Astron, RA-5000 Cordoba, Argentina; [Masset, Frederic; Koenigsberger, Gloria] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ciencias Fis, Cuernavaca 62210, Morelos, Mexico; [Szulagyi, Judit] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, CNRS, Observ Cote Azur, Lab Lagrange, F-06304 Nice, France","Masset, F (reprint author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ciencias Fis, Ave Univ S-N, Cuernavaca 62210, Morelos, Mexico.",fmasset@cea.fr,"Benitez-Llambay, Pablo/N-1680-2016","Benitez-Llambay, Pablo/0000-0002-3728-3329","CONICET; UNAM [PAPIIT IA101113, IN105313]; CONACyT [178377, 129343]; Capital Fund Management's J.

In this duality, classical concepts-wave or particle-are still referred to, and interference happens in ordinary space-time. On the other hand, two-particle interference takes place in a mathematical space that has no classical counterpart. Entanglement lies at the heart of this interference, as it does in the fundamental tests of quantum mechanics involving the violation of Bell's inequalities(1-4). The Hong, Ou and Mandel experiment(5) is a conceptually simpler situation, in which the interference between two-photon amplitudes also leads to behaviour impossible to describe using a simple classical model. Here we report the realization of the Hong, Ou and Mandel experiment using atoms instead of photons. We create a source that emits pairs of atoms, and cause one atom of each pair to enter one of the two input channels of a beam-splitter, and the other atom to enter the other input channel. When the atoms are spatially overlapped so that the two inputs are indistinguishable, the atoms always emerge together in one of the output channels. This result opens the way to testing Bell's inequalities involving mechanical observables of massive particles, such as momentum, using methods inspired by quantum optics(6,7), and to testing theories of the quantum-to-classical transition(8-11). Our work also demonstrates a new way to benchmark non-classical atom sources(12,13) that may be of interest for quantum information processing(14) and quantum simulation(15).","[Lopes, R.; Imanaliev, A.; Aspect, A.; Cheneau, M.; Boiron, D.; Westbrook, C.

This effect can greatly reduce the lasing threshold of the emitter(1-5), providing a low-threshold laser system with small footprint, low power consumption and ultrafast modulation. An ultralow-threshold nanoscale laser has been successfully developed by embedding quantum dots into a photonic crystal cavity (PCC)(6-8). However, several challenges impede the practical application of this architecture, including the randompositions and compositional fluctuations of the dots(7), extreme difficulty in current injection(8), and lack of compatibility with electronic circuits(7,8). Here we report a new lasing strategy: an atomically thin crystalline semiconductor-that is, a tungsten diselenide monolayer-is non-destructively and deterministically introduced as a gain medium at the surface of a pre-fabricated PCC. A continuous-wave nanolaser operating in the visible regime is thereby achieved with an optical pumping threshold as low as 27 nanowatts at 130 kelvin, similar to the value achieved in quantum-dot PCC lasers(7). The key to the lasing action lies in the monolayer nature of the gain medium, which confines direct-gap excitons to within one nanometre of the PCC surface. The surface-gain geometry gives unprecedented accessibility and hence the ability to tailor gain properties via external controls such as electrostatic gating and current injection, enabling electrically pumped operation. Our scheme is scalable and compatible with integrated photonics for on-chip optical communication technologies.","[Wu, Sanfeng; Schaibley, John R.; Feng, Liefeng; Xu, Xiaodong] Univ Washington, Dept Phys, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Buckley, Sonia; Vuckovic, Jelena] Stanford Univ, Ginzton Lab, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Feng, Liefeng] Tianjin Univ, Dept Appl Phys, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China; [Yan, Jiaqiang; Mandrus, David G.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Mat Sci & Technol Div, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Yan, Jiaqiang; Mandrus, David G.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Mandrus, David G.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Phys & Astron, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Hatami, Fariba] Humboldt Univ, Dept Phys, D-12489 Berlin, Germany; [Yao, Wang] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Phys, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Yao, Wang] Univ Hong Kong, Ctr Theoret & Computat Phys, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Majumdar, Arka] Univ Washington, Dept Elect Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Xu, Xiaodong] Univ Washington, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Xu, XD (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Phys, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",arka@uw.edu; xuxd@uw.edu,"Yao, Wang/C-1353-2008; Wu, Sanfeng/L-1323-2016","Yao, Wang/0000-0003-2883-4528; Wu, Sanfeng/0000-0002-6227-6286","AFOSR [FA9550-14-1-0277]; NSF [ECS-9731293]; State of Washington through the University of Washington Clean Energy Institute; Presidential Early Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE) [N00014-08-1-0561]; Stanford Graduate Fellowship; US DoE, BES, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division; European Commission [FP7-ICT-2013-613024-GRASP];  [NSF-EFRI-1433496]","We thank C.

Increasingly, such probes are now being designed to respond to wavelengths in the near-infrared region, where reduced tissue autofluorescence and photon attenuation enable subsurface in vivo sensing(4). But even in the near-infrared region, optical resolution and sensitivity decrease rapidly with increasing depth. Here we present a sensor design that obviates the need for optical addressability by operating in the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) radio-frequency spectrum, where signal attenuation and distortion by tissue and biological media are negligible, where background interferences vanish, and where sensors can be spatially located using standard magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) equipment. The radio-frequency-addressable sensor assemblies presented here comprise pairs of magnetic disks spaced by swellable hydrogel material; they reversibly reconfigure in rapid response to chosen stimuli, to give geometry-dependent, dynamic NMR spectral signatures. The sensors can be made from biocompatible materials, are themselves detectable down to low concentrations, and offer potential responsive NMR spectral shifts that are close to a million times greater than those of traditional magnetic resonance spectroscopies. Inherent adaptability should allow such shape-changing systems to measure numerous different environmental and physiological indicators, thus providing broadly generalizable, MRI-compatible, radio-frequency analogues to optically based probes for use in basic chemical, biological, medical and engineering research.","[Zabow, G.; Dodd, S.

Electronic excitation, ligand loss from the metal centre, or a combination of both, creates changes in charge and spin density at the metal site(3-11) that need to be controlled to optimize complexes for photocatalytic hydrogen production(8) and selective carbon-hydrogen bond activation(9-11). An understanding at the molecular level of how transition-metal complexes catalyse reactions, and in particular of the role of the short-lived and reactive intermediate states involved, will be critical for such optimization. However, suitable methods for detailed characterization of electronic excited states have been lacking. Here we show, with the use of X-ray laser-based femtosecond-resolution spectroscopy and advanced quantum chemical theory to probe the reaction dynamics of the benchmark transition-metal complex Fe(CO)(5) in solution, that the photo-induced removal of CO generates the 16-electron Fe(CO)(4) species, a homogeneous catalyst(12,13) with an electron deficiency at the Fe centre(14,15), in a hitherto unreported excited singlet state that either converts to the triplet ground state or combines with a CO or solvent molecule to regenerate a penta-coordinated Fe species on a sub-picosecond timescale. This finding, which resolves the debate about the relative importance of different spin channels in the photochemistry of Fe(CO)(5) (refs 4, 16-20), was made possible by the ability of femtosecond X-ray spectroscopy to probe frontier-orbital interactions with atom specificity. We expect the method to be broadly applicable in the chemical sciences, and to complement approaches that probe structural dynamics in ultrafast processes.","[Wernet, Ph.; Kunnus, K.; Beye, M.; Schreck, S.; Foehlisch, A.] Helmholtz Zentrum Berlin Mat & Energie GmbH, Inst Methods & Instrumentat Synchrotron Radiat Re, D-12489 Berlin, Germany; [Kunnus, K.; Schreck, S.; Foehlisch, A.] Univ Potsdam, Inst Phys & Astron, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany; [Josefsson, I.; Odelius, M.] Stockholm Univ, Dept Phys, AlbaNova Univ Ctr, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Rajkovic, I.; Quevedo, W.; Gruebel, S.; Scholz, M.] Max Planck Inst Biophys Chem, IFG Struct Dynam Bio Chem Syst, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Nordlund, D.] SLAC Natl Accelerator Lab, Stanford Synchrotron Radiat Lightsource, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Zhang, W.; Hartsock, R.

A central question concerns themorphology of the last common ancestor of living jawed vertebrates, with competing hypotheses advancing either a chondrichthyan-(1-3) or osteichthyan-like(4,5) model. Here we present Janu-siscus schultzei gen. et sp. nov., an Early Devonian (approximately 415 Myr ago) gnathostome from Siberia previously interpreted as a ray-finned fish(6), which provides important new information about cranial anatomy near the last common ancestor of chondrichthyans and osteichthyans. The skull roof of Janusiscus resembles that of early osteichthyans, with large plates bearing vermiform ridges and partially enclosed sensory canals. High-resolution computed tomography (CT) reveals a braincase bearing characters typically associated with either chondrichthyans (large hypophyseal opening accommodating the internal carotid arteries) or osteichthyans (facial nerve exiting through jugular canal, endolymphatic ducts exiting posterior to the skull roof) but lacking a ventral cranial fissure, the presence of which is considered a derived feature of crown gnathostomes(7,8). A conjunction of well-developed cranial processes in Janusiscus helps unify the comparative anatomy of early jawed vertebrate neurocrania, clarifying primary homologies in 'placoderms', osteichthyans and chondrichthyans. Phylogenetic analysis further supports the chondrichthyan affinities of 'acanthodians', and places Janusiscus and the enigmatic Ramirosuarezia(9) in a polytomy with crown gnathostomes. The close correspondence between the skull roof of Janusiscus and that of osteichthyans suggests that an extensive dermal skeleton was present in the last common ancestor of jawed vertebrates(4), but ambiguities arise from uncertainties in the anatomy of Ramirosuarezia. The unexpected contrast between endoskeletal structure in Janusiscus and its superficially osteichthyan-like dermal skeleton highlights the potential importance of other incompletely known Siluro-Devonian 'bony fishes' for reconstructing patterns of trait evolution near the origin of modern gnathostomes.","[Giles, Sam; Friedman, Matt] Univ Oxford, Dept Earth Sci, Oxford OX1 3AN, England; [Brazeau, Martin D.] Nat Biodivers Ctr, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands; [Brazeau, Martin D.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Life Sci, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England","Brazeau, MD (reprint author), Nat Biodivers Ctr, POB 9517, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands.",m.brazeau@imperial.ac.uk,,,Natural Environment Research Council Cohort [NE/J500045/1]; Philip Leverhulme Prize; John Fell Fund; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme [311092],"We thank U.

The origin of the snake-like body form, with its deregionalized pre-cloacal axial skeleton, has been explained as either homogenization of Hox gene expression domains(9), or retention of standard vertebrate Hox domains with alteration of downstream expression that suppresses development of distinct regions(10-13). Both models assume a highly regionalized ancestor, but the extent of deregionalization of the primaxial domain (vertebrae, dorsal ribs) of the skeleton in snake-like body forms has never been analysed. Here we combine geometric morphometrics and maximum-likelihood analysis to show that the pre-cloacal primaxial domain of elongate, limb-reduced lizards and snakes is not deregionalized compared with limbed taxa, and that the phylogenetic structure of primaxial morphology in reptiles does not support a loss of regionalization in the evolution of snakes. We demonstrate that morphometric regional boundaries correspond to mapped gene expression domains in snakes, suggesting that their primaxial domain is patterned by a normally functional Hox code. Comparison of primaxial osteology in fossil and modern amniotes with Hox gene distributions within Amniota indicates that a functional, sequentially expressed Hox code patterned a subtle morphological gradient along the anterior-posterior axis in stem members of amniote clades and extant lizards, including snakes. The highly regionalized skeletons of extant archosaurs and mammals result from independent evolution in the Hox code and do not represent ancestral conditions for clades with snake-like body forms. The developmental origin of snakes is best explained by decoupling of the primaxial and abaxial domains and by increases in somite number(15), not by changes in the function of primaxial Hox genes(9,10).","[Head, Jason J.] Univ Nebraska, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA; [Head, Jason J.] Univ Nebraska, Nebraska State Museum Nat Hist, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA; [Polly, P.

Here we show that plant pri-miRNAs contain short open reading frame sequences that encode regulatory peptides. The pri-miR171b of Medicago truncatula and the pri-miR165a of Arabid-opsis thaliana produce peptides, which we term miPEP171b and miPEP165a, respectively, that enhance the accumulation of their corresponding mature miRNAs, resulting in downregulation of target genes involved in root development. The mechanism of miRNA-encoded peptide (miPEP) action involves increasing transcription of the pri-miRNA. Five other pri-miRNAs of A. thaliana and M. truncatula encode active miPEPs, suggesting that miPEPs are widespread throughout the plant kingdom. Synthetic miPEP171b and miPEP165a peptides applied to plants specifically trigger the accumulation of miR171b and miR165a, leading to reduction of lateral root development and stimulation of mainroot growth, respectively, suggesting that miPEPs might have agronomical applications.","[Lauressergues, Dominique; Couzigou, Jean-Malo; Clemente, Helene San; Dunand, Christophe; Becard, Guillaume; Combier, Jean-Philippe] Univ Toulouse, UPS, UMR5546, Lab Rech Sci Vegetales, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France; [Lauressergues, Dominique; Couzigou, Jean-Malo; Clemente, Helene San; Dunand, Christophe; Becard, Guillaume; Combier, Jean-Philippe] CNRS, UMR5546, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France; [Martinez, Yves] Federat Rech FR3450 CNRS, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France","Combier, JP (reprint author), Univ Toulouse, UPS, UMR5546, Lab Rech Sci Vegetales, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France.",combier@lrsv.ups-tlse.fr,"dunand, christophe/I-6424-2012","dunand, christophe/0000-0003-1637-4042",French ANR project miRcorrhiza [ANR-12-JSV7-0002-01]; CNRS; Paul Sabatier University Toulouse; Toulouse Tech Transfer,"This work was funded by the French ANR project miRcorrhiza (ANR-12-JSV7-0002-01), the CNRS, Paul Sabatier University Toulouse.

Both peptides bind with high affinity to the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R); existing data show that alpha-MSH is an agonist that couples the receptor to the Gas signalling pathway(1), while AgRP binds competitively to block alpha-MSH binding(2) and blocks the constitutive activity mediated by the ligand-mimetic amino-terminal domain of the receptor(3). Here we show that, in mice, regulation of firing activity of neurons from the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) by alpha-MSH and AgRP can be mediated independently of G alpha(s) signalling by ligand-induced coupling of MC4R to closure of inwardly rectifying potassium channel, Kir7.1. Furthermore, AgRP is a biased agonist that hyperpolarizes neurons by binding to MC4R and opening Kir7.1, independently of its inhibition of alpha-MSH binding. Consequently, Kir7.1 signalling appears to be central to melanocortin-mediated regulation of energy homeostasis within the PVN. Coupling of MC4R to Kir7.1 may explain unusual aspects of the control of energy homeostasis by melanocortin signalling, including the gene dosage effect of MC4R4 and the sustained effects of AgRP on food intake(5).","[Ghamari-Langroudi, Masoud; Digby, Gregory J.; Sebag, Julien A.; Matthews, Robert; Gillyard, Taneisha; Panaro, Brandon L.; Cone, Roger D.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Mol Physiol & Biophys, Med Ctr, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [Millhauser, Glenn L.; Palomino, Rafael] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Chem & Biochem, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Gillyard, Taneisha] Meharry Med Coll, Dept Pharmacol, Nashville, TN 37208 USA; [Tough, Iain R.; Cox, Helen M.] Kings Coll London, Wolfson Ctr Age Related Dis, London SE1 1UL, England; [Denton, Jerod S.] Vanderbilt Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Anesthesiol, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [Denton, Jerod S.] Vanderbilt Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Pharmacol, Nashville, TN 37232 USA","Ghamari-Langroudi, M (reprint author), Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Mol Physiol & Biophys, Med Ctr, Nashville, TN 37232 USA.",masoud.ghamari-langroudi@vanderbilt.edu; roger.cone@vanderbilt.edu,,"sebag, julien/0000-0002-8366-312X; Cox, Helen/0000-0001-9024-1497","NIH [RO1DK070332, 5R01 DK082884-03, R01DK064265]; Vanderbilt Diabetes Research and Training Center [DK020593]","We thank C.

Within the thousand bacterial species present in the intestine, the symbiont segmented filamentous bacterium(SFB) is unique in its ability to potently stimulate the post-natal maturation of the B-and T-cell compartments and induce a striking increase in the small-intestinal Th17 responses(3-5). Unlike other commensals, SFB intimately attaches to absorptive epithelial cells in the ileum and cells overlying Peyer's patches(6,7). This colonization does not result in pathology; rather, it protects the host from pathogens(4). Yet, little is known about the SFB-host interaction that underlies the important immunostimulatory properties of SFB, because SFB have resisted in vitro culturing for more than 50 years. Here we grow mouse SFB outside their host in an SFB-host cell co-culturing system. Single-celled SFB isolated from mono-colonized mice undergo filamentation, segmentation, and differentiation to release viable infectious particles, the intracellular offspring, which can colonize mice to induce signature immune responses. In vitro, intracellular offspring can attach to mouse and human host cells and recruit actin. In addition, SFB can potently stimulate the upregulation of host innate defence genes, inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines. In vitro culturing thereby mimics the in vivo niche, provides new insights into SFB growth requirements and their immunostimulatory potential, and makes possible the investigation of the complex developmental stages of SFB and the detailed dissection of the unique SFB-host interaction at the cellular and molecular levels.","[Schnupf, Pamela; Friedman, Robin; Nigro, Giulia; Sansonetti, Philippe J.] Inst Pasteur, Unite Pathogenie Microbienne Mol, F-75724 Paris 15, France; [Schnupf, Pamela; Friedman, Robin; Nigro, Giulia; Sansonetti, Philippe J.] Inst Pasteur, INSERM, Unit U786, F-75724 Paris 15, France; [Schnupf, Pamela; Gaboriau-Routhiau, Valerie; Cerf-Bensussan, Nadine] Inst Imagine, INSERM, UMR1163, Lab Intestinal Immun, F-75015 Paris, France; [Gaboriau-Routhiau, Valerie] INRA, Micalis UMR1319, F-78350 Jouy En Josas, France; [Gaboriau-Routhiau, Valerie; Gros, Marine; Cerf-Bensussan, Nadine] Univ Paris 05, Sorbonne Paris Cite, F-75015 Paris, France; [Gaboriau-Routhiau, Valerie; Gros, Marine; Cerf-Bensussan, Nadine] Inst Imagine, F-75015 Paris, France; [Gros, Marine] Ecole Normale Super Lyon, Dept Biol, F-69007 Lyon, France; [Moya-Nilges, Maryse] Inst Pasteur, Imagopole, Ultrastruct Microscopy Platform, F-75724 Paris 15, France; [Sansonetti, Philippe J.] Coll France, Microbiol & Malad Infect, F-75005 Paris, France","Sansonetti, PJ (reprint author), Inst Pasteur, Unite Pathogenie Microbienne Mol, 25-28 Rue Dr Roux, F-75724 Paris 15, France.",nadine.cerf-bensussan@inserm.fr; psanson@pasteur.fr,"Schnupf, Pamela/G-6040-2017; GABORIAU-ROUTHIAU, Valerie/H-9493-2017; Cerf-Bensussan, nadine/H-9505-2017","Schnupf, Pamela/0000-0003-4292-1257; GABORIAU-ROUTHIAU, Valerie/0000-0002-7662-4034; Cerf-Bensussan, nadine/0000-0003-0665-1245; Nigro, Giulia/0000-0002-1014-7394","INSERM, Institut Pasteur, College de France; INRA; Investissement d'Avenir [ANR-10-IAHU-01]; LabEX IBEID;  [TORNADO-FP7-KBBE-2007-2A-222720];  [ANR-2010-BLAN1317];  [ERC-2009-AG-232798-HOMEOPITH];  [ERC-2013-AdG-339579-DECRYPT];  [ERC-2013-AdG-339407-IMMUNOBIOTA]","We are grateful to B.

This organ is also home to trillions of microorganisms that play an important role in tissue homeostasis and local immunity(1-4). Skin microbial communities are highly diverse and can be remodelled over time or in response to environmental challenges(5-7). How, in the context of this complexity, individual commensal microorganisms may differentially modulate skin immunity and the consequences of these responses for tissue physiology remains unclear. Here we show that defined commensals dominantly affect skin immunity and identify the cellular mediators involved in this specification. In particular, colonization with Staphylococcus epidermidis induces IL-17A(+) CD8(+) T cells that home to the epidermis, enhance innate barrier immunity and limit pathogen invasion. Commensal-specific T-cell responses result from the coordinated action of skin-resident dendritic cell subsets and are not associated with inflammation, revealing that tissue-resident cells are poised to sense and respond to alterations in microbial communities. This interaction may represent an evolutionary means by which the skin immune system uses fluctuating commensal signals to calibrate barrier immunity and provide heterologous protection against invasive pathogens. These findings reveal that the skin immune landscape is a highly dynamic environment that can be rapidly and specifically remodelled by encounters with defined commensals, findings that have profound implications for our understanding of tissue-specific immunity and pathologies.","[Naik, Shruti; Bouladoux, Nicolas; Linehan, Jonathan L.; Han, Seong-Ji; Harrison, Oliver J.; Wilhelm, Christoph; Himmelfarb, Sarah; Byrd, Allyson L.; Brenchley, Jason M.; Belkaid, Yasmine] NIAID, Immun Barrier Sites Initiat, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Naik, Shruti; Bouladoux, Nicolas; Linehan, Jonathan L.; Han, Seong-Ji; Harrison, Oliver J.; Wilhelm, Christoph; Himmelfarb, Sarah; Byrd, Allyson L.; Belkaid, Yasmine] NIAID, Mucosal Immunol Sect, Parasit Dis Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Conlan, Sean; Byrd, Allyson L.; Deming, Clayton; Segre, Julia A.] NHGRI, Translat & Funct Genom Branch, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Quinones, Mariam] NIAID, Bioinformat & Computat Biosci Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Brenchley, Jason M.] NIAID, Immunopathogenesis Sect, Mol Microbiol Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Kong, Heidi H.] NCI, Dermatol Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Tussiwand, Roxanne; Murphy, Kenneth M.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Immunol, Howard Hughes Med Inst, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Merad, Miriam] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Oncol Sci, Tisch Canc Inst, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Merad, Miriam] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Inst Immunol, New York, NY 10029 USA","Belkaid, Y (reprint author), NIAID, Immun Barrier Sites Initiat, NIH, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",ybelkaid@niaid.nih.gov,,"Bouladoux, Nicolas/0000-0003-1593-671X; Kong, Heidi/0000-0003-4424-064X",Division of Intramural Research of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID); Human Frontier Science Program,"This work was supported by the Division of Intramural Research of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and by the Human Frontier Science Program (C.W.).

Recent phase III vaccine trials showed partial protection, and in particular no protection for dengue virus serotype 2 (refs 3, 4). Structural studies so far have characterized only epitopes recognized by serotype-specific human antibodies(5,6). We recently isolated human antibodies potently neutralizing all four dengue virus serotypes(7). Here we describe the X-ray structures of four of these broadly neutralizing antibodies in complex with the envelope glycoprotein E from dengue virus serotype 2, revealing that the recognition determinants are at a serotype-invariant site at the E-dimer interface, including the exposed main chain of the E fusion loop(8) and the two conserved glycan chains. This 'E-dimer-dependent epitope' is also the binding site for the viral glycoprotein prM during virus maturation in the secretory pathway of the infected cell(9), explaining its conservation across serotypes and highlighting an Achilles' heel of the virus with respect to antibody neutralization. These findings will be instrumental for devising novel immunogens to protect simultaneously against all four serotypes of dengue virus.","[Rouvinski, Alexander; Guardado-Calvo, Pablo; Barba-Spaeth, Giovanna; Duquerroy, Stephane; Vaney, Marie-Christine; Kikuti, Carlos M.; Sanchez, M.

In each meiotic cell, recombination is initiated by numerous DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) created by Spo11, the evolutionarily conserved topoisomerase-like protein(1), but how these DSBs are distributed relatively uniformly across the four chromatids that make up each chromosome pair is poorly understood. Here we employ Saccharomyces cerevisiae to demonstrate distance-dependent DSB interference in cis (in which the occurrence of a DSB suppresses adjacent DSB formation)-a process that is mediated by the conserved DNA damage response kinase, Tel1(ATM). The inhibitory function of Tel1 acts on a relatively local scale, while over large distances DSBs have a tendency to form independently of one another even in the presence of Tel1. Notably, over very short distances, loss of Tel1 activity causes DSBs to cluster within discrete zones of concerted DSB activity. Our observations support a hierarchical view of recombination initiation where Tel1(ATM) prevents clusters of DSBs, and further suppresses DSBs within the surrounding chromosomal region. Such collective negative regulation will help to ensure that recombination events are dispersed evenly and arranged optimally for genetic exchange and efficient chromosome segregation.","[Garcia, Valerie; Gray, Stephen; Allison, Rachal M.; Cooper, Tim J.; Neale, Matthew J.] Univ Sussex, Genome Damage & Stabil Ctr, Brighton BN1 9RQ, E Sussex, England","Garcia, V (reprint author), Univ Sussex, Genome Damage & Stabil Ctr, Brighton BN1 9RQ, E Sussex, England.",v.garcia@sussex.ac.uk; m.neale@sussex.ac.uk,"Garcia, Valerie/R-4543-2016",,MRC New Investigator Grant; University Research Fellowship from the Royal Society; Career Development Award from the Human Frontiers Science Program Organisation; Consolidator Grant from the European Research Council,"V.G. was supported by an MRC New Investigator Grant to M.J.N.

Variability within a clonal population of cells originates from such stochastic processes, which may be amplified or reduced by deterministic factors(5). Cell-to-cell variability, such as that seen in the heterogeneous response of bacteria to antibiotics, or of cancer cells to treatment, is understood as the inevitable consequence of stochasticity. Variability in cell-cycle duration was observed long ago; however, its sources are still unknown. A central question is whether the variance of the observed distribution originates from stochastic processes, or whether it arises mostly from a deterministic process that only appears to be random. A surprising feature of cell-cycle-duration inheritance is that it seems to be lost within one generation but to be still present in the next generation, generating poor correlation between mother and daughter cells but high correlation between cousin cells(6). This observation suggests the existence of underlying deterministic factors that determine the main part of cell-to-cell variability. We developed an experimental system that precisely measures the cell-cycle duration of thousands of mammalian cells along several generations and a mathematical framework that allows discrimination between stochastic and deterministic processes in lineages of cells. We show that the inter-and intra-generation correlations reveal complex inheritance of the cell-cycle duration. Finally, we build a deterministic nonlinear toy model for cell-cycle inheritance that reproduces the main features of our data. Our approach constitutes a general method to identify deterministic variability in lineages of cells or organisms, which may help to predict and, eventually, reduce cell-to-cell heterogeneity in various systems, such as cancer cells under treatment.","[Sandler, Oded; Mizrahi, Sivan Pearl; Simon, Itamar] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Hadassah Med Sch, IMRIC, Dept Microbiol & Mol Genet, IL-91120 Jerusalem, Israel; [Sandler, Oded; Mizrahi, Sivan Pearl; Weiss, Noga; Agam, Oded; Balaban, Nathalie Q.] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Racah Inst Phys, Edmond J Safra Campus, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel","Balaban, NQ (reprint author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Racah Inst Phys, Edmond J Safra Campus, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel.",agam@phys.huji.ac.il; itamarsi@ekmd.huji.ac.il; nathalieqb@phys.huji.ac.il,,"Pearl Mizrahi, Sivan/0000-0001-5093-8361; Balaban, Nathalie/0000-0001-8018-0766; Simon, Itamar/0000-0002-8517-1903","ISF [592/10, 567/10, 9/09, 302/14]; ERC [281306, 260871]; Chief Scientist Office of the Israel Ministry of Health; Weinkselbaum family medical research fund; Clore Foundation","We thank H.

Using in vitro angiogenesis screens with short interfering RNA and chemical inhibitors, we define here a MAP4K4-moesin-talin-beta 1-integrin molecular pathway that promotes efficient plasma membrane retraction during endothelial cell migration. Loss of MAP4K4 decreased membrane dynamics, slowed endothelial cell migration, and impaired angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. In migrating endothelial cells, MAP4K4 phosphorylates moesin in retracting membranes at sites of focal adhesion disassembly. Epistasis analyses indicated that moesin functions downstream of MAP4K4 to inactivate integrin by competing with talin for binding to beta 1-integrin intracellular domain. Consequently, loss of moesin (encoded by the MSN gene) or MAP4K4 reduced adhesion disassembly rate in endothelial cells. Additionally, alpha 5 beta 1-integrin blockade reversed the membrane retraction defects associated with loss of Map4k4 in vitro and in vivo. Our study uncovers a novel aspect of endothelial cell migration. Finally, loss of MAP4K4 function suppressed pathological angiogenesis in disease models, identifying MAP4K4 as a potential therapeutic target.","[Vitorino, Philip; Yeung, Stacey; Crow, Ailey; Smyczek, Tanya; Ye, Weilan] Genentech Inc, Dept Mol Biol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Bakke, Jesse] St Jude Childrens Res Hosp, Chem Biol & Therapeut Dept, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [West, Kristina; McNamara, Erin; Gould, Stephen] Genentech Inc, Translat Oncol Dept, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Eastham-Anderson, Jeffrey] Genentech Inc, Dept Pathol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Harris, Seth F.] Genentech Inc, Dept Biol Struct, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Ndubaku, Chudi] Genentech Inc, Discovery Chem Dept, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA","Ye, WL (reprint author), Genentech Inc, Dept Mol Biol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA.",loni@gene.com,,"Ndubaku, Chudi/0000-0003-4183-0417",,,,42,28,28,1,29,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,26-Mar,2015,519,7544,,,,,425,+,,10.1038/nature14323,,20,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,CE1WF,WOS:000351602800046,25799996,No,,,11/20/17

To accomplish this, initiation is partitioned into two temporally discrete steps: a double hexameric minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex is first loaded at replication origins during G1 phase, and then converted to the active CMG (Cdc45-MCM-GINS) helicase during S phase. Here we describe the reconstitution of budding yeast DNA replication initiation with 16 purified replication factors, made from 42 polypeptides. Origin-dependent initiation recapitulates regulation seen in vivo. Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibits MCM loading by phosphorylating the origin recognition complex (ORC) and promotes CMG formation by phosphorylating Sld2 and Sld3. Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK) promotes replication by phosphorylating MCM, and can act either before or after CDK.

Recent observations of large-scale molecular outflows(3-8) in ultraluminous infrared galaxies support this quasar-feedback idea, because they directly trace the gas from which stars form. Theoreticalmodels(9-12) suggest that these outflows originate as energy-conserving flows driven by fast accretion-disk winds. Proposed connections between large-scale molecular outflows and accretion-disk activity in ultraluminous galaxies were incomplete(3-8) because no accretion-disk wind had been detected. Conversely, studies of powerful accretion-disk wind shave until now focused only on X-ray observations of local Seyfert galaxies(13,14) and a few higher-redshift quasars(15-19). Here we report observations of a powerful accretion-disk wind with a mildly relativistic velocity (a quarter that of light) in the X-ray spectrum of IRAS F11119+3257, a nearby (redshift 0.189) optically classified type 1 ultraluminous infrared galaxy hosting a powerful molecular outflow(6). The active galactic nucleus is responsible for about 80 per cent of the emission, with a quasar-like luminosity(6) of 1.5 x 10(46) ergs per second. The energetics of these two types of wide-angle outflows is consistent with the energy-conserving mechanism(9-12) that is the basis of the quasar feedback(1) in active galactic nuclei that lack powerful radio jets (such jets are an alternative way to drive molecular outflows).","[Tombesi, F.] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Xray Astrophys Lab, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Tombesi, F.; Melendez, M.; Veilleux, S.; Reynolds, C.

Metrologically useful entangled states of large atomic ensembles have been experimentally realized(1-10), but these states display Gaussian spin distribution functions with a non-negative Wigner quasiprobability distribution function. Non-Gaussian entangled states have been produced in small ensembles of ions(11,12), and very recently in large atomic ensembles(13-15). Here we generate entanglement in a large atomic ensemble via an interaction with a very weak laser pulse; remarkably, the detection of a single photon prepares several thousand atoms in an entangled state. We reconstruct a negative-valued Wigner function-an important hallmark of non-classicality-and verify an entanglement depth (the minimum number of mutually entangled atoms) of 2,9106190 out of 3,100 atoms. Attaining such a negative Wigner function and the mutual entanglement of virtually all atoms is unprecedented for an ensemble containing more than a few particles. Although the achieved purity of the state is slightly below the threshold for entanglement-induced metrological gain, further technical improvement should allow the generation of states that surpass this threshold, and of more complex Schrodinger cat states for quantum metrology and information processing. More generally, our results demonstrate the power of heralded methods for entanglement generation, and illustrate how the information contained in a single photon can drastically alter the quantum state of a large system.","[McConnell, Robert; Zhang, Hao; Hu, Jiazhong; Cuk, Senka; Vuletic, Vladan] MIT, Dept Phys, MIT Harvard Ctr Ultracold Atoms, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [McConnell, Robert; Zhang, Hao; Hu, Jiazhong; Cuk, Senka; Vuletic, Vladan] MIT, Elect Res Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Cuk, Senka] Univ Belgrade, Inst Phys, Belgrade 11080, Serbia","Vuletic, V (reprint author), MIT, Dept Phys, MIT Harvard Ctr Ultracold Atoms, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",vuletic@mit.edu,,"Hu, Jiazhong/0000-0002-2937-4810","NSF; DARPA (QUASAR); MURI grant through AFOSR; Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia [III45016, OI171038]","We thank M.

Liquid behaviour on a surface can range from complete spreading, as in the 'tears of wine' effect(3,4), tominimal wetting as observed on a superhydrophobic lotus leaf(5). Controlling droplet movement is important in microfluidic liquid handling(6), on self-cleaning surfaces(7) and in heat transfer(8). Droplet motion can be achieved by gradients of surface energy(9-13). However, existing techniques require either a large gradient or a carefully prepared surface(9) to overcome the effects of contact line pinning, which usually limit dropletmotion(14). Here we show that two-component droplets of well-chosen miscible liquids such as propylene glycol and water depositedon clean glass are not subject to pinning and cause the motion of neighbouring droplets over a distance. Unlike the canonical predictions for these liquids on a high-energy surface, these droplets do not spread completely but exhibit an apparent contact angle. We demonstrate experimentally and analytically that these droplets are stabilized by evaporation-induced surface tension gradients and that they move in response to the vapour emitted by neighbouring droplets. Our fundamental understanding of this robust system enabled us to construct a wide variety of autonomous fluidic machines out of everyday materials.","[Cira, N.

This increase, however, is not spatially uniform. Observations and models have found that changes in rainfall show patterns characterized as 'wet-gets-wetter'(1-7) and 'warmer-gets-wetter'(5,8,9). These changes in precipitation are largely located in the tropics and hence are probably associated with convection. However, the underlying physical processes for the observed changes are not entirely clear. Here we show from observations that most of the regional increase in tropical precipitation is associated with changes in the frequency of organized deep convection. By assessing the contributions of various convective regimes to precipitation, we find that the spatial patterns of change in the frequency of organized deep convection are strongly correlated with observed change in rainfall, both positive and negative (correlation of 0.69), and can explain most of the patterns of increase in rainfall. In contrast, changes in less organized forms of deep convection or changes in precipitation within organized deep convection contribute less to changes in precipitation. Our results identify organized deep convection as the link between changes in rainfall and in the dynamics of the tropical atmosphere, thus providing a framework for obtaining a better understanding of changes in rainfall. Given the lack of a distinction between the different degrees of organization of convection in climate models(10), our results highlight an area of priority for future climate model development in order to achieve accurate rainfall projections in a warming climate.","[Tan, Jackson; Jakob, Christian] Monash Univ, Sch Earth Atmosphere & Environm, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Syst Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Rossow, William B.] CUNY City Coll, CREST Inst, New York, NY 10031 USA; [Tselioudis, George] NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, New York, NY 10027 USA","Tan, J (reprint author), Monash Univ, Sch Earth Atmosphere & Environm, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Syst Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",jackson.tan@nasa.gov,"Rossow, William/F-3138-2015; Jakob, Christian/A-1082-2010","Jakob, Christian/0000-0002-5012-3207; Tan, Jackson/0000-0001-7085-3074",Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science [CE110001028]; NASA [NNX13AO39G]; NASA; Monash University,"We thank S.

The ability to sense and predict threatening or stressful events is essential for such adaptive behaviour. In the mammalian brain, one putative stress sensor is the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT), an area that is readily activated by both physical and psychological stressors(1-3). However, the role of the PVT in the establishment of adaptive behavioural responses remains unclear. Here we show in mice that the PVT regulates fear processing in the lateral division of the central amygdala (CeL), a structure that orchestrates fear learning and expression(4,5). Selective inactivation of CeL-projecting PVT neurons prevented fear conditioning, an effect that can be accounted for by an impairment in fear-conditioning-induced synaptic potentiation onto somatostatin-expressing (SOM+) CeL neurons, which has previously been shown to store fear memory(6). Consistently, we found that PVT neurons preferentially innervate SOM+ neurons in the CeL, and stimulation of PVT afferents facilitated SOM+ neuron activity and promoted intra-CeL inhibition, two processes that are critical for fear learning and expression(5,6). Notably, PVT modulation of SOM+ CeL neurons was mediated by activation of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) receptor tropomysin-related kinase B (TrkB). As a result, selective deletion of either Bdnf in the PVT or Trkb in SOM+ CeL neurons impaired fear conditioning, while infusion of BDNF into the CeL enhanced fear learning and elicited unconditioned fear responses. Our results demonstrate that the PVT-CeL pathway constitutes a novel circuit essential for both the establishment of fear memory and the expression of fear responses, and uncover mechanisms linking stress detection in PVT with the emergence of adaptive behaviour.","[Penzo, Mario A.; Robert, Vincent; Tucciarone, Jason; Wang, Minghui; Van Aelst, Linda; Huang, Z.

Fear memories can be retrieved long after learning(1,2), but little is known about how retrieval circuits change with time(3,4). Here we show that the dorsal midline thalamus of rats is required for the retrieval of auditory conditioned fear at late (24 hours, 7 days, 28 days), but not early (0.5 hours, 6 hours) time points after learning. Consistent with this, the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT), a subregion of the dorsal midline thalamus, showed increased c-Fos expression only at late time points, indicating that the PVT is gradually recruited for fear retrieval. Accordingly, the conditioned tone responses of PVTneurons increased with time after training. The prelimbic (PL) prefrontal cortex, which is necessary for fear retrieval(5-7), sends dense projections to the PVT8. Retrieval at late time points activated PL neurons projecting to the PVT, and optogenetic silencing of these projections impaired retrieval at late, but not early, time points. In contrast, silencing of PL inputs to the basolateral amygdala impaired retrieval at early, but not late, time points, indicating a time-dependent shift in retrieval circuits. Retrieval at late time points also activated PVT neurons projecting to the central nucleus of the amygdala, and silencing these projections at late, but not early, time points induced a persistent attenuation of fear. Thus, the PVT may act as a crucial thalamic node recruited into cortico-amygdalar networks for retrieval and maintenance of long-term fear memories.","[Do-Monte, Fabricio H.; Quinones-Laracuente, Kelvin; Quirk, Gregory J.] Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Psychiat, Sch Med, San Juan, PR 00936 USA; [Do-Monte, Fabricio H.; Quinones-Laracuente, Kelvin; Quirk, Gregory J.] Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, Sch Med, San Juan, PR 00936 USA","Do-Monte, FH (reprint author), Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Psychiat, Sch Med, POB 365067, San Juan, PR 00936 USA.",fabriciodomonte@gmail.com,,,"NIH [R01-MH058883, P50-MH086400]; University of Puerto Rico President's Office; MBRS-RISE Program [R25-GM061838]; NSF [DBI-0115825]; RCMI [8G12-MD007600]","We thank G.

Long-winged morphs can fly, which allows them to escape adverse habitats and track changing resources, whereas short-winged morphs are flightless, but usually possess higher fecundity than the winged morphs(1-3). Studies on aphids, crickets and planthoppers have revealed that alternative wing morphs develop in response to various environmental cues(1,2,4-8), and that the response to these cuesmay be mediated by developmental hormones, although research in this area has yielded equivocal and conflicting results about exactly which hormones are involved(4,8-10). As it stands, the molecular mechanism underlying wing morph determination in insects has remained elusive. Here we show that two insulin receptors in the migratory brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens, InR1 and InR2, have opposing roles in controlling long wing versus short wing development by regulating the activity of the forkhead transcription factor Foxo. InR1, acting via the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K)-protein kinase B (Akt) signalling cascade, leads to the long-winged morph if active and the short-winged morph if inactive. InR2, by contrast, functions as a negative regulator of the InR1-PI(3)K-Akt pathway: suppression of InR2 results in development of the long-winged morph. The brain-secreted ligand Ilp3 triggers development of long-winged morphs. Our findings provide the first evidence of a molecular basis for the regulation of wing polyphenism in insects, and they are also the first demonstration-to our knowledge-of binary control over alternative developmental outcomes, and thus deepen our understanding of the development and evolution of phenotypic plasticity.","[Xu, Hai-Jun; Xue, Jian; Lu, Bo; Zhang, Xue-Chao; Zhuo, Ji-Chong; He, Shu-Fang; Ma, Xiao-Fang; Jiang, Ya-Qin; Fan, Hai-Wei; Xu, Ji-Yu; Ye, Yu-Xuan; Pan, Peng-Lu; Li, Qiao; Bao, Yan-Yuan; Zhang, Chuan-Xi] Zhejiang Univ, Inst Insect Sci, State Key Lab Rice Biol, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Xu, Hai-Jun; Xue, Jian; Lu, Bo; Zhang, Xue-Chao; Zhuo, Ji-Chong; He, Shu-Fang; Ma, Xiao-Fang; Jiang, Ya-Qin; Fan, Hai-Wei; Xu, Ji-Yu; Ye, Yu-Xuan; Pan, Peng-Lu; Li, Qiao; Bao, Yan-Yuan; Zhang, Chuan-Xi] Zhejiang Univ, Inst Insect Sci, Minist Agr, Key Lab Agr Entomol, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Nijhout, H.

Enhancing cGMP synthesis or blocking its degradation by phosphodiesterase type 5A (PDE5A) protects against cardiovascular disease(1,2). However, cGMP stimulation alone is limited by counter-adaptions including PDE upregulation(3). Furthermore, although PDE5A regulates nitric-oxide-generated cGMP(4,5), nitric oxide signalling is often depressed by heart disease(6). PDEs controlling natriuretic-peptide-coupled cGMP remain uncertain. Here we show that cGMP-selective PDE9A (refs 7, 8) is expressed in the mammalian heart, including humans, and is upregulated by hypertrophy and cardiac failure. PDE9A regulates natriuretic-peptide-rather than nitric-oxide-stimulated cGMP in heart myocytes and muscle, and its genetic or selective pharmacological inhibition protects against pathological responses to neurohormones, and sustained pressure-overload stress. PDE9A inhibition reverses pre-established heart disease independent of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity, whereas PDE5A inhibition requires active NOS. Transcription factor activation and phosphoproteome analyses of myocytes with each PDE selectively inhibited reveals substantial differential targeting, with phosphorylation changes from PDE5A inhibition being more sensitive to NOS activation. Thus, unlike PDE5A, PDE9A can regulate cGMP signalling independent of the nitric oxide pathway, and its role in stress-induced heart disease suggests potential as a therapeutic target.","[Lee, Dong I.; Zhu, Guangshuo; Cho, Gun-Sik; Holewinski, Ronald; Danner, Thomas; Zhang, Manling; Rainer, Peter P.; Bedja, Djahida; Kirk, Jonathan A.; Ranek, Mark J.; Kwon, Chulan; Van Eyk, Jennifer E.; Takimoto, Eiki; Kass, David A.] Johns Hopkins Med Inst, Dept Med, Div Cardiol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Sasaki, Takashi] Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corp, Div Res, Adv Med Res Labs, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2270033, Japan; [Hamdani, Nazha; Paulus, Walter J.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam Med Ctr, Inst Cardiovasc Res, Dept Physiol, NL-1081 BT Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Holewinski, Ronald; Van Eyk, Jennifer E.] Cedars Sinai Med Ctr, Inst Heart, Los Angeles, CA 90048 USA; [Holewinski, Ronald; Van Eyk, Jennifer E.] Cedars Sinai Med Ctr, Adv Clin Biosyst Res Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90048 USA; [Jo, Su-Hyun] Kangwon Natl Univ, Inst Biosci & Biotechnol, Plus Grad Program BK21, Dept Physiol,Coll Med, Chunchon 200701, South Korea; [Dostmann, Wolfgang R.] Univ Vermont, Dept Pharmacol, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Margulies, Kenneth B.] Univ Penn, Dept Med, Perelman Sch Med, Div Cardiovasc Med,Cardiovasc Inst, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Kass, DA (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Med Inst, Dept Med, Div Cardiol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",dkass@jhmi.edu,"Rainer, Peter/M-2145-2016","Rainer, Peter/0000-0002-2840-6454; Kirk, Jonathan/0000-0002-5192-2860","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [HL-119012, HL-089297, HL-07227]; Fondation Leducq TransAtlantic Network of Excellence; Peter Belfer Foundation; Abraham and Virginia Weiss Professorship; American Heart Association; Austrian Academy of Sciences; National Institutes of Health [HL089847, HL105993]; European Commission [261409]; Johns Hopkins Innovation Proteomics Center in Heart Failure [NHLBI-HV-10-05 (2), HHSN268201000032C]; NIH [HL68891]; Totman Trust for Biomedical Research;  [HL-093432]","We thank students R.

The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) integrates the presence of growth factors, energy levels, glucose and amino acids to modulate metabolic status and cellular responses(1-3). mTORC1 is activated at the surface of lysosomes by the RAG GTPases and the Ragulator complex through a not fully understood mechanism monitoring amino acid availability in the lysosomal lumen and involving the vacuolar H1-ATPase(4-8). Here we describe the uncharacterized human member 9 of the solute carrier family 38 (SLC38A9) as a lysosomal membrane-resident protein competent in amino acid transport. Extensive functional proteomic analysis established SLC38A9 as an integral part of the Ragulator-RAG GTPases machinery. Gain of SLC38A9 function rendered cells resistant to amino acid withdrawal, whereas loss of SLC38A9 expression impaired amino-acid-induced mTORC1 activation. Thus SLC38A9 is a physical and functional component of the amino acid sensing machinery that controls the activation of mTOR.","[Rebsamen, Manuele; Kandasamy, Richard K.; Snijder, Berend; Fauster, Astrid; Rudashevskaya, Elena L.; Bruckner, Manuela; Scorzoni, Stefania; Huber, Kilian V.

This initial event requires recognition of the junction between the stem and the flanking single-stranded RNA of the pri-miRNA hairpin by DGCR8 followed by recruitment of DROSHA, which cleaves the RNA duplex to yield the pre-miRNA product(5). While the mechanisms underlying pri-miRNA processing have been determined, the mechanism by which DGCR8 recognizes and binds pri-miRNAs, as opposed to other secondary structures present in transcripts, is not understood. Here we find in mammalian cells that methyltransferase-like 3(METTL3) methylates pri-miRNAs, marking them for recognition and processing by DGCR8. Consistent with this, METTL3 depletion reduced the binding of DGCR8 to pri-miRNAs and resulted in the global reduction of mature miRNAs and concomitant accumulation of unprocessed pri-miRNAs. In vitro processing reactions confirmed the sufficiency of the N6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) mark in promoting pri-miRNA processing. Finally, gain-of-function experiments revealed that METTL3 is sufficient to enhance miRNA maturation in a global and non-cell-type-specific manner. Our findings reveal that the m(6)A mark acts as a key post-transcriptional modification that promotes the initiation of miRNA biogenesis.","[Alarcon, Claudio R.; Lee, Hyeseung; Goodarzi, Hani; Halberg, Nils; Tavazoie, Sohail F.] Rockefeller Univ, Lab Syst Canc Biol, New York, NY 10065 USA","Tavazoie, SF (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Lab Syst Canc Biol, 1230 York Ave, New York, NY 10065 USA.",stavazoie@rockefeller.edu,,"Halberg, Nils/0000-0002-2943-3147; Goodarzi, Hani/0000-0002-9648-8949",Era of Hope Department of Defense Award; Department of Defense,We thank members of the Tavazoie laboratory as well as S.

RNAs are central to biological regulation, and the ability of RNA to adopt specific structures intimately controls every step of the gene expression program(1). However, our understanding of physiological RNA structures is limited; current in vivo RNA structure profiles include only two of the four nucleotides that make up RNA(2,3). Here we present a novel biochemical approach, in vivo click selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation and profiling experiment (icSHAPE), which enables the first global view, to our knowledge, of RNA secondary structures in living cells for all four bases. icSHAPE of the mouse embryonic stem cell transcriptome versus purified RNA folded in vitro shows that the structural dynamics of RNA in the cellular environment distinguish different classes of RNAs and regulatory elements. Structural signatures at translational start sites and ribosome pause sites are conserved from in vitro conditions, suggesting that these RNA elements are programmed by sequence. In contrast, focal structural rearrangements in vivo reveal precise interfaces of RNA with RNA-binding proteins or RNA-modification sites that are consistent with atomic-resolution structural data. Such dynamic structural footprints enable accurate prediction of RNA-protein interactions and N-6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) modification genome wide.

If implemented, the cost of electricity generated by a fossil fuel-burning power plant would rise substantially, owing to the expense of removing CO2 from the effluent stream. There is therefore an urgent need for more efficient gas separation technologies, such as those potentially offered by advanced solid adsorbents. Here we show that diamine-appended metal-organic frameworks can behave as 'phase-change' adsorbents, with unusual step-shaped CO2 adsorption isotherms that shift markedly with temperature. Results from spectroscopic, diffraction and computational studies show that the origin of the sharp adsorption step is an unprecedented cooperative process in which, above a metal-dependent threshold pressure, CO2 molecules insert into metal-amine bonds, inducing a reorganization of the amines into well-ordered chains of ammonium carbamate. As a consequence, large CO2 separation capacities can be achieved with small temperature swings, and regeneration energies appreciably lower than achievable withstate-of-the-art aqueous amine solutions become feasible. The results provide a mechanistic framework for designing highly efficient adsorbents for removing CO2 from various gas mixtures, and yield insights into the conservation of Mg2+ within the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase family of enzymes.","[McDonald, Thomas M.; Mason, Jarad A.; Bloch, Eric D.; Gygi, David; Long, Jeffrey R.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kong, Xueqian; Vlaisavljevich, Bess; Schnell, Sondre K.; Lee, Kyuho; Smit, Berend; Reimer, Jeffrey A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem & Biol Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kong, Xueqian] Zhejiang Univ, Dept Chem, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Dani, Alessandro; Crocella, Valentina; Giordanino, Filippo; Bordiga, Silvia] Univ Turin, NIS & INSTM Ctr Reference, Dept Chem, I-10135 Turin, Italy; [Odoh, Samuel O.; Dzubak, Allison L.; Planas, Nora; Gagliardi, Laura] Univ Minnesota, Dept Chem, Chem Theory Ctr, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Odoh, Samuel O.; Dzubak, Allison L.; Planas, Nora; Gagliardi, Laura] Univ Minnesota, Supercomp Inst, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Drisdell, Walter S.; Smit, Berend; Kortright, Jeffrey B.; Reimer, Jeffrey A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Poloni, Roberta] Univ Grenoble Alpes, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Poloni, Roberta] Sci & Ingn Mat & Proc SIMAP, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Poloni, Roberta] CNRS, SIMAP, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Schnell, Sondre K.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Chem, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Pascal, Tod; Wan, Liwen F.; Prendergast, David; Neaton, Jeffrey B.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Neaton, Jeffrey B.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Neaton, Jeffrey B.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Kavli Energy Nanosci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Smit, Berend] EPFL, Inst Sci & Ingn Chim, Valais, CH-1950 Sion, Switzerland","Long, JR (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",jrlong@berkeley.edu,"; Smit, Berend/B-7580-2009; Bordiga, Silvia/M-3875-2014; Neaton, Jeffrey/F-8578-2015; Foundry, Molecular/G-9968-2014; Crocella, Valentina/E-5203-2016; Schnell, Sondre /H-4934-2016","Gagliardi, Laura/0000-0001-5227-1396; Smit, Berend/0000-0003-4653-8562; Bordiga, Silvia/0000-0003-2371-4156; Neaton, Jeffrey/0000-0001-7585-6135; Crocella, Valentina/0000-0002-3606-8424; Schnell, Sondre /0000-0002-0664-6756; Vlaisavljevich, Bess/0000-0001-6065-0732","Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), US Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AR0000103, DE-AR0000402]; DOE, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-SC0001015]; GENCI (CINES) [2014-c2015097211]; Nanoporous Materials Genome Center of the DOE, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Division of Chemical Sciences, Geosciences, and Biosciences [DE-FG02-12ER16362]; DOE Office of Science [DE-AC02-06CH11357]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences of the DOE [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; National Science Foundation; Research Council of Norway [230534];  [MIUR-PRIN 2010-2011]","We thank A.

We use haplotype-based statistical methods to analyse genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from a carefully chosen geographically diverse sample of 2,039 individuals from the United Kingdom. This reveals a rich and detailed pattern of genetic differentiation with remarkable concordance between genetic clusters and geography. The regional genetic differentiation and differing patterns of shared ancestry with 6,209 individuals from across Europe carry clear signals of historical demographic events. We estimate the genetic contribution to southeastern England from Anglo-Saxon migrations to be under half, and identify the regions not carrying genetic material from these migrations. We suggest significant pre-Roman but post-Mesolithic movement into southeastern England from continental Europe, and show that in non-Saxon parts of the United Kingdom, there exist genetically differentiated subgroups rather than a general 'Celtic' population.","[Leslie, Stephen] Royal Childrens Hosp, Murdoch Childrens Res Inst, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia; [Leslie, Stephen] Univ Melbourne, Dept Math & Stat, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Leslie, Stephen; Winney, Bruce; Boumertit, Abdelhamid; Day, Tammy; Hutnik, Katarzyna; Royrvik, Ellen C.; Bodmer, Walter] Univ Oxford, Dept Oncol, Oxford OX3 7DQ, England; [Hellenthal, Garrett] Univ Coll London Genet Inst, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Davison, Dan] Counsyl, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Cunliffe, Barry] Univ Oxford, Inst Archaeol, Oxford OX1 2PG, England; [Lawson, Daniel J.] Univ Bristol, Dept Math, Bristol BS8 1TW, Avon, England; [Falush, Daniel] Swansea Univ, Coll Med, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales; [Freeman, Colin; Donnelly, Peter] Wellcome Trust Ctr Human Genet, Oxford OX3 7BN, England; [Pirinen, Matti] Univ Helsinki, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Myers, Simon; Donnelly, Peter] Univ Oxford, Dept Stat, Oxford OX1 3TG, England; [Robinson, Mark] Univ Oxford, Univ Museum Nat Hist, Oxford OX1 3PW, England","Donnelly, P (reprint author), Wellcome Trust Ctr Human Genet, Roosevelt Dr, Oxford OX3 7BN, England.",donnelly@well.ox.ac.uk,"Myers, Simon/A-6792-2015","Myers, Simon/0000-0002-2585-9626; Pirinen, Matti/0000-0002-1664-1350; Bodmer, Walter/0000-0001-6244-9792; Lawson, Daniel/0000-0002-5311-6213","Wellcome Trust [072974/Z/03/Z, 088262/Z/09/Z, 075491/Z/04/Z, 075491/Z/04/A, 075491/Z/04/B, 090532/Z/09/Z, 084818/Z/08/Z, 095552/Z/11/Z, 085475/Z/08/Z, 098387/Z/12/Z, 098386/Z/12/Z]; Academy of Finland [257654]; Australian National Health and Medical Research Council [APP1053756]; Wolfson-Royal Society Merit Award","We thank J.

Using NMR relaxation dispersion, we show here that wobble dG.dT and rG.rU mispairs in DNA and RNA duplexes exist in dynamic equilibrium with short-lived, low-populated Watson-Crick-like mispairs that are stabilized by rare enolic or anionic bases. These mispairs can evade Watson-Crick fidelity checkpoints and form with probabilities (10(-3) to 10(-5)) that strongly imply a universal role in replication and translation errors.

In eukaryotes, the heterohexameric origin recognition complex (ORC) is essential for coordinating replication onset. Here we describe the crystal structure of Drosophila ORC at 3.5 angstrom resolution, showing that the 270 kiloclalton initiator core complex comprises a two-layered notched ring in which a collar of winged-helix domains from the Orcl-5 subunits sits atop a layer of AAA+ (ATPases associated with a variety of cellular activities) folds. Although canonical inter-AAA+ domain interactions exist between four of the six ORC subunits, unanticipated features are also evident. These include highly interdigitated domain-swapping interactions between the winged-helix folds and AAA+ modules of neighbouring protomers, and a quasi-spiral arrange. ment of DNA binding elements that circumnavigate an approximately 20 A wide channel in the centre of the complex. Comparative analyses indicate that ORC encircles DNA, using its winged-helix domain face to engage the mini-chromosome maintenance 2-7 (MCM2-7) complex during replicative helicase loading; however, an observed out-of-plane rotation of more than 900 for the Orc1 AAA+ domain disrupts interactions with catalytic amino acids in Orc4, narrowing and sealing off entry into the central channel. Prima facie, our data indicate that Drosophila ORC can switch between active and autoinhibited conformations, suggesting a novel means for cell cycle and/or developmental control of ORC functions.","[Bleichert, Franziska; Berger, James M.] Johns Hopkins Sch Med, Dept Biophys & Biophys Chem, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Botchan, Michael R.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Berger, JM (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Sch Med, Dept Biophys & Biophys Chem, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",mbotchan@berkeley.edu; jberge29@jhmi.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health [GM071747, CA R37-30490]; UC Berkeley Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science","We thank the beamline scientists at beamlines 8.3.1 of the Advanced Light Source (Berkeley Lawrence National Laboratory), 23-ID-B of the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratory) and X25 of the National Synchrotron Light Source (Brookhaven National Laboratory) for technical support with X-ray diffraction data collection, and the Nogales laboratory (University of California, Berkeley) for EM support.

But it has proved difficult for existing spectrographs to characterize them using their ultraviolet light(2-4). The detailed properties of these galaxies could be measured from dust and cool gas emission at far-infrared wavelengths if the galaxies have become sufficiently enriched in dust and metals. So far, however, the most distant galaxy discovered via its ultraviolet emission and subsequently detected in dust emission is only at z = 3.2 (ref. 5), and recent results have cast doubt on whether dust and molecules can be found in typical galaxies at z >= 7(6-8). Here we report thermal dust emission from an archetypal early Universe star-forming galaxy, A1689-zDI. We detect its stellar continuum in spectroscopy and determine its redshift to be z = 7.5 +/- 0.2 from a spectroscopic detection of the Lyman-a break. A1689-zD1 is representative of the star-forming population during the epoch of reionization(9), with a total star-formation rate of about 12 solar masses per year. The galaxy is highly evolved: it has a large stellar mass and is heavily enriched in dust, with a dust-to-gas ratio close to that of the Milky Way.

Low star-formation efficiency is a critical parameter in galaxy evolution: it is why stars are still forming nearly 14 billion years after the Big Bang(1) and why star clusters generally do not survive their births, instead dispersing to form galactic disks or bulges'. Yet the existence of ancient massive bound star clusters (globular clusters) in the Milky Way suggests that efficiencies were higher when they formed ten billion years ago. A local dwarf galaxy, NGC 5253, has a young star cluster that provides an example of highly efficient star formation(3). Here we report the detection of the J = 3 -> 2 rotational transition of CO at the location of the massive cluster. The gas cloud is hot, dense, quiescent and extremely dusty. Its gas-to-dust ratio is lower than the Galactic value, which we attribute to dust enrichment by the embedded star cluster. Its star-formation efficiency exceeds 50 percent, tenfold that of clouds in the Milky Way. We suggest that high efficiency results from the force-feeding of star formation by a streamer of gas falling into the galaxy.","[Turner, J. L.; Consiglio, S.

Coordination of a functional group to a metal is often a key driving force and control element in many important reactions including asymmetric hydrogenation(6), epoxidation(7,8) and lithiation(9). Exploitation of this effect has led to the development of a broad range of directed C-H activation reactions(10-14). However, these C-H activation methods are limited to proximal C-H bonds, which are spatially and geometrically accessible from the directing functional group. The development of meta-selective C-H functionalizations remains a significant challenges(1-5,15-17). We recently developed a U-shaped template that can be used to overcome this constraint and have shown that it can be used to selectively activate remote meta-C-H bonds(1,2). Although this approach has proved to be applicable to various substrates and catalytic transformations(3-5), the need for a covalently attached, complex template is a substantial drawback for synthetic applications. Here we report an alternative approach employing norbornene as a transient mediator to achieve meta-selective C-H activation with a simple and common orthodirecting group. The use of a newly developed pyridine-based ligand is crucial for relaying the palladium catalyst to the meta position by norbornene after initial ortho-C-H activation. This catalytic reaction demonstrates the feasibility of switching ortho-selectivity to metaselectivity in C-H activation of the same substrate by catalyst control.","[Wang, Xiao-Chen; Gong, Wei; Fang, Li-Zhen; Zhu, Ru-Yi; Li, Suhua; Engle, Keary M.; Yu, Jin-Quan] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Chem, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Yu, JQ (reprint author), Scripps Res Inst, Dept Chem, 10550 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",yu200@scripps.edu,"Engle, Keary/A-9223-2015","Engle, Keary/0000-0003-2767-6556",Scripps Research Institute; National Institutes of Health (NIGMS) [1R01 GM102265]; China Scholarship Council,"We thank J.

Radiative transfer models calculate that the increase in CO2 since 1750 corresponds to a global annualmean radiative forcing at the tropopause of 1.82 +/- 0.19W m(-2) (ref. 2). However, despite widespread scientific discussion and modelling of the climate impacts of well-mixed greenhouse gases, there is little direct observational evidence of the radiative impact of increasing atmospheric CO2. Here we present observationally based evidence of clear-sky CO2 surface radiative forcing that is directly attributable to the increase, between 2000 and 2010, of 22 parts per million atmospheric CO2. The time series of this forcing at the two locations the Southern Great Plains and the North Slope of Alaska are derived from Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer spectra' together with ancillary measurements and thoroughly corroborated radiative transfer calculations'. The time series both show statistically significant trends of 0.2 W m(-2) per decade (with respective uncertainties of +/- 0.06 W m(-2) per decade and 0.07 W m(-2) per decade) and have seasonal ranges of 0.1-0.2W m(-2). This is approximately ten per cent of the trend in downwelling longwave radiation'''. These results confirm theoretical predictions of the atmospheric greenhouse effect due to anthropogenic emissions, and provide empirical evidence of how rising CO2 levels, mediated by temporal variations due to photosynthesis and respiration, are affecting the surface energy balance.","[Feldman, D.

Nevertheless, it is unclear how the terrestrial carbon sink will evolve as climate and atmospheric composition continue to change. Here we analyse the historical evolution of the biomass dynamics of the Amazon rainforest over three decades using a distributed network of 321 plots. While this analysis confirms that Amazon forests have acted as a long-term net biomass sink, we find a long-term decreasing trend of carbon accumulation. Rates of net increase in above-ground biomass declined by one-third during the past decade compared to the 1990s. This is a consequence of growth rate increases levelling off recently, while biomass mortality persistently increased throughout, leading to a shortening of carbon residence times. Potential drivers for the mortality increase include greater climate variability, and feedbacks of faster growth on mortality, resulting in shortened tree longevity(5). The observed decline of the Amazon sink diverges markedly from the recent increase in terrestrial carbon uptake at the global scale"", and is contrary to expectations based on models(6).","[Brienen, R.

Polyploidy, usually whole-genome duplication, is proposed to alter the rate of evolutionary adaptation. This could occur through complex effects on the frequency or fitness of beneficial mutations(2,5-7). For example, in diverse cell types and organisms, immediately after a whole-genome duplication, newly formed polyploids missegregate chromosomes and undergo genetic instability(8-13). The instability following wholegenome duplications is thought to provide adaptive mutations in microorganisms(13,14) and can promote tumorigenesis in mammalian cells(11,15). Polyploidy may also affect adaptation independently of beneficial mutations through ploidy-specific changes in cell physiology(16). Here we perform in vitro evolution experiments to test directly whether polyploidy can accelerate evolutionary adaptation. Compared with haploids and diploids, tetraploids undergo significantly faster adaptation. Mathematical modelling suggests that rapid adaptation of tetraploids is driven by higher rates of beneficial mutations with stronger fitness effects, which is supported by whole-genome sequencing and phenotypic analyses of evolved clones. Chromosome aneuploidy, concerted chromosome loss, and point mutations all provide large fitness gains. We identify several mutations whose beneficial effects are manifest specifically in the tetraploid strains. Together, these results provide direct quantitative evidence that in some environments polyploidy can accelerate evolutionary adaptation.","[Selmecki, Anna M.; Guillet, Marie; Pellman, David] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Pediat Oncol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Selmecki, Anna M.; Guillet, Marie; Pellman, David] Harvard Univ, Dept Cell Biol, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Selmecki, Anna M.; Guillet, Marie; Pellman, David] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chevy Chase, MD 20815 USA; [Maruvka, Yosef E.; Michor, Franziska] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Biostat & Computat Biol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Maruvka, Yosef E.; Michor, Franziska] Boston Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Richmond, Phillip A.; Sorenson, Amber L.; Dowell, Robin] Univ Colorado, BioFrontiers Inst, Boulder, CO 80303 USA; [Richmond, Phillip A.; Sorenson, Amber L.; Dowell, Robin] Univ Colorado, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Shoresh, Noam] Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [De, Subhajyoti] Univ Colorado Sch Med, Dept Med, Aurora, CO 80045 USA; [De, Subhajyoti] Colorado Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat & Informat, Aurora, CO 80045 USA; [De, Subhajyoti] Univ Colorado Canc Ctr, Mol Oncol Program, Aurora, CO 80045 USA; [Kishony, Roy] Harvard Univ, Dept Syst Biol, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Kishony, Roy] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Dept Biol, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel; [Pellman, David] Childrens Hosp, Dept Pediat Hematol Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Selmecki, AM (reprint author), Creighton Univ Sch Med, Dept Med Microbiol & Immunol, 2500 Calif Plaza, Omaha, NE 68178 USA.",AnnaSelmecki@creighton.edu; david_pellman@dfci.harvard.edu,,"DOWELL, ROBIN/0000-0001-7665-9985; RICHMOND, PHILLIP/0000-0003-1882-6014","Howard Hughes Medical Institute; National Institutes of Health [R37 GM61345, R01 GM081617]; G.

The central circuits that process these signals are not understood. In Drosophila, a specific brain region receives input from thermoreceptor cells(2,3). Here we show that distinct genetically identified projection neurons (PNs) in this brain region are excited by cooling, warming, or both. The PNs excited by cooling receive mainly feed-forward excitation from cool thermoreceptors. In contrast, the PNs excited by warming ('warm-PNs') receive both excitation from warm thermoreceptors and crossover inhibition from cool thermoreceptors through inhibitory interneurons. Notably, this crossover inhibition elicits warming-evoked excitation, because warming suppresses tonic activity in cool thermoreceptors. This in turn disinhibits warm-PNs and sums with feed-forward excitation evoked by warming. Crossover inhibition could cancel non-thermal activity (noise) that is positively correlated among warm and cool thermoreceptor cells, while reinforcing thermal activity which is anti-correlated.

However, flies show a host of complex innate and learned responses to temperature, indicating that they are able to extract a range of information from this simple input. Here we define the anatomical and physiological repertoire for temperature representation in the Drosophila brain. First, we use a photolabelling strategy(2) to trace the connections that relay peripheral thermosensory information to higher brain centres, and show that they largely converge onto three target regions: the mushroom body, the lateral horn (both of which are well known centres for sensory processing) and the posterior lateral protocerebrum, a region we now define as a major site of thermosensory representation. Next, using in vivo calcium imaging(3), we describe the thermosensory projection neurons selectively activated by hot or cold stimuli. Fast-adapting neurons display transient ON and OFF responses and track rapid temperature shifts remarkably well, while slow-adapting cell responses better reflect the magnitude of simple thermal changes. Unexpectedly, we also find a population of broadly tuned cells that respond to both heating and cooling, and show that they are required for normal behavioural avoidance of both hot and cold in a simple two-choice temperature preference assay. Taken together, our results uncover a coordinated ensemble of neural responses to temperature in the Drosophila brain, demonstrate that a broadly tuned thermal line contributes to rapid avoidance behaviour, and illustrate how stimulus quality, temporal structure, and intensity can be extracted from a simple glomerular map at a single synaptic station.","[Frank, Dominic D.; Jouandet, Genevieve C.; Kearney, Patrick J.; Gallio, Marco] Northwestern Univ, Dept Neurobiol, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Macpherson, Lindsey J.] Columbia Univ, Dept Biochem, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Macpherson, Lindsey J.] Columbia Univ, Dept Mol Biophys, New York, NY 10032 USA","Gallio, M (reprint author), Northwestern Univ, Dept Neurobiol, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",marco.gallio@northwestern.edu,,"Kearney, Patrick/0000-0002-7145-5964; Gallio, Marco/0000-0003-2132-0639; Macpherson, Lindsey/0000-0002-1089-3733",NIH [1R01NS086859-01];  [2T32MH067564],"We thank V.

How such different roles of tubulin and FtsZ evolved is unknown. Studying Archaea may provide clues as these organisms share characteristics with Eukarya and Bacteria(3). Here we report the structure and function of proteins from a distinct family related to tubulin and FtsZ, named CetZ, which co-exists with FtsZ in many archaea. CetZ X-ray crystal structures showed the FtsZ/tubulin superfamily fold, and one crystal form contained sheets of protofilaments, suggesting a structural role. However, inactivation of CetZ proteins in Haloferax volcanii did not affect cell division. Instead, CetZ1 was required for differentiation of the irregular plate-shaped cells into a rod-shaped cell type that was essential for normal swimming motility. CetZ1 formed dynamic cytoskeletal structures in vivo, relating to its capacity to remodel the cell envelope and direct rod formation. CetZ2 was also implicated in H. volcanii cell shape control. Our findings expand the known roles of the FtsZ/tubulin superfamily to include archaeal cell shape dynamics, suggesting that a cytoskeletal role might predate eukaryotic cell evolution, and they support the premise that a major function of the microbial rod shape is to facilitate swimming.","[Duggin, Iain G.; Aylett, Christopher H.

As such, autologous DCs generated ex vivo have been pulsed with tumour antigens and injected back into patients as immunotherapy. While DC vaccines have shown limited promise in the treatment of patients with advanced cancers(2-4) including glioblastoma(5-7), the factors dictating DC vaccine efficacy remain poorly understood. Here we show that pre-conditioning the vaccine site with a potent recall antigen such as tetanus/diphtheria (Td) toxoid can significantly improve the lymph node homing and efficacy of tumour-antigen-specific DCs. To assess the effect of vaccine site pre-conditioning in humans, we randomized patients with glioblastoma to pre-conditioning with either mature DCs8 or Td unilaterally before bilateral vaccination with DCs pulsed with Cytomegalovirus phosphoprotein 65(pp65) RNA. We and other laboratories have shown that pp65 is expressed in more than 90% of glioblastoma specimens but not in surrounding normal brain(9-12), providing an unparalleled opportunity to subvert this viral protein as a tumour-specific target. Patients given Td had enhanced DC migration bilaterally and significantly improved survival. In mice, Td pre-conditioning also enhanced bilateral DC migration and suppressed tumour growth in a manner dependent on the chemokine CCL3. Our clinical studies and corroborating investigations in mice suggest that pre-conditioning with a potent recall antigen may represent a viable strategy to improve anti-tumour immunotherapy.","[Mitchell, Duane A.; Archer, Gary E.; Desjardins, Annick; Friedman, Allan H.; Friedman, Henry S.; McLendon, Roger E.; Reardon, David A.; Vredenburgh, James J.; Bigner, Darell D.; Sampson, John H.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Ctr, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Mitchell, Duane A.; Batich, Kristen A.; Sanchez-Perez, Luis; Congdon, Kendra L.; Reap, Elizabeth A.; Archer, Gary E.; Desjardins, Annick; Friedman, Allan H.; Friedman, Henry S.; Reardon, David A.; Vredenburgh, James J.; Bigner, Darell D.; Sampson, John H.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Div Neurosurg, Dept Surg, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Mitchell, Duane A.; Batich, Kristen A.; McLendon, Roger E.; Bigner, Darell D.; Sampson, John H.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Pathol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Gunn, Michael D.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Med, Div Cardiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Gunn, Michael D.; Huang, Min-Nung; Sampson, John H.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Immunol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Nair, Smita K.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Surg, Div Surg Sci, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Herndon, James E., II; Coan, April] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Biostat & Bioinformat, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Sampson, John H.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Radiat Oncol, Durham, NC 27710 USA","Sampson, JH (reprint author), Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Ctr, Durham, NC 27710 USA.",duane.mitchell@neurosurgery.ufl.edu; john.sampson@duke.edu,,"Sykes, April/0000-0002-7667-8155","National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke [P50-CA108786]; SRC on Primary and Metastatic Tumors of the CNS [P50-NS20023]; NIH [R01-CA177476-01, R01-NS067037, R01-CA134844, P01-CA154291-01A1]; National Brain Tumor Society; American Brain Tumor Association; Accelerate Brain Cancer Cure Foundation; Kinetics Foundation; Ben and Catherine Ivy Foundation; Duke University from the National Institutes of Health National Center for Research Resources [1UL2 RR024128-01]","The authors thank the staff who supported this study, including R.

Because human tyrosyl transfer-RNA(tRNA) synthetase (TyrRS) translocates to the nucleus under stress conditions(6), we considered the possibility that the tyrosine-like phenolic ring of resveratrol might fit into the active site pocket to effect a nuclear role. Here we present a 2.1 angstrom co-crystal structure of resveratrol bound to the active site of TyrRS. Resveratrol nullifies the catalytic activity and redirects TyrRS to a nuclear function, stimulating NAD(+)-dependent auto-poly-ADP-ribosylation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1). Downstream activation of key stress signalling pathways are causally connected to TyrRS-PARP1-NAD(+) collaboration. This collaborationis also demonstrated in the mouse, and is specifically blocked in vivo by a resveratrol-displacing tyrosyl adenylate analogue. In contrast to functionally diverse tRNA synthetase catalytic nulls created by alternative splicing events that ablate active sites(7), here a non-spliced TyrRS catalytic null reveals a new PARP1- and NAD(+)-dependent dimension to the physiological mechanism of resveratrol.","[Sajish, Mathew; Schimmel, Paul] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Scripps Labs TRNA Synthetase Res, Skaggs Inst Chem Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Schimmel, Paul] Scripps Florida Res Inst, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA","Schimmel, P (reprint author), Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Scripps Labs TRNA Synthetase Res, Skaggs Inst Chem Biol, 10550 North Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",schimmel@scripps.edu,,"Mathew, Sajish/0000-0001-6715-5953",National Cancer Institute [CA92577]; National Foundation for Cancer Research; aTyr Pharma; Scripps Research Institute,"This work was supported in part the National Cancer Institute grant CA92577, by a fellowship from the National Foundation for Cancer Research, and by aTyr Pharma through an agreement with The Scripps Research Institute.

In eukaryotes, 5',5'-triphosphate-linked 7-methyl-guanosine protects messenger RNA from degradation and modulates maturation, localization and translation(1). Recently, the cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) was reported as a covalent modification of bacterial RNA(2). Given the central role of NAD in redox biochemistry, posttranslational protein modification and signalling(3,4), its attachment to RNA indicates that there are unknown functions of RNA in these processes and undiscovered pathways in RNA metabolism and regulation. The unknown identity of NAD-modified RNAs has so far precluded functional analyses. Here we identify NAD-linked RNAs from bacteria by chemo-enzymatic capture and next-generation sequencing(NAD captureSeq). A mong those identified, specific regulatory small RNAs (sRNAs) and sRNA-like 5'-terminal fragments of certain mRNAs are particularly abundant. Analogous to a eukaryotic cap, 5'-NAD modification is shown in vitro to stabilize RNA against 5'-processing by the RNA-pyrophosphohydrolase RppH(5) and against endonucleolytic cleavage by ribonuclease (RNase) E-6. The nudix phosphohydrolase NudC(7) decaps NAD-RNA and thereby triggers RNase-E-mediated RNA decay, while being inactive against triphosphate-RNA. In vivo, similar to 13% of the abundant sRNA RNAI is NAD-capped in the presence, and similar to 26% in the absence, of functional NudC. To our knowledge, this is the first description of a cap-like structure and a decapping machinery in bacteria.","[Cahova, Hana; Winz, Marie-Luise; Hoefer, Katharina; Nuebel, Gabriele; Jaeschke, Andres] Heidelberg Univ, IPMB, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany","Jaschke, A (reprint author), Heidelberg Univ, IPMB, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.",jaeschke@uni-hd.de,"Cahova, Hana/O-4595-2014; Jaschke, Andres/F-1575-2010","Cahova, Hana/0000-0002-4986-7858; Jaschke, Andres/0000-0002-4625-2655; Winz, Marie-Luise/0000-0003-0740-8618",Alexander-von-Humboldt Foundation; Hartmut Hoffmann-Berling International Graduate School of Molecular & Cellular Biology; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB 623]; Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF); Helmholtz Initiative on Synthetic Biology,"We thank the CellNetworks Deep Sequencing Core Facility for Solexa sequencing, M.

The Hubbard model-a simplified representation of fermions moving on a periodic lattice-is thought to describe the essential details of copper oxide superconductivity(2). This model describes many of the features shared by the copper oxides, including an interaction-driven Mott insulating state and an antiferromagnetic (AFM) state. Optical lattices filled with a two-spin-component Fermi gas of ultracold atoms can faithfully realize the Hubbard model with readily tunable parameters, and thus provide a platform for the systematic exploration of its phase diagram(3,4). Realization of strongly correlated phases, however, has been hindered by the need to cool the atoms to temperatures as low as the magnetic exchange energy, and also by the lack of reliable thermometry(5). Here we demonstrate spin-sensitive Bragg scattering of light to measure AFM spin correlations in a realization of the three-dimensional Hubbard model at temperatures down to 1.4 times that of the AFM phase transition. This temperature regime is beyond the range of validity of a simple high-temperature series expansion, which brings our experiment close to the limit of the capabilities of current numerical techniques, particularly at metallic densities. We reach these low temperatures using a compensated optical lattice technique(6), in which the confinement of each lattice beam is compensated by a blue-detuned laser beam. The temperature of the atoms in the lattice is deduced by comparing the light scattering to determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations(7) and numerical linked-cluster expansion(8) calculations. Further refinement of the compensated lattice may produce even lower temperatures which, along with light scattering thermometry, would open avenues for producing and characterizing other novel quantum states of matter, such as the pseudogap regime and correlated metallic states of the two-dimensional Hubbard model.","[Hart, Russell A.; Duarte, Pedro M.; Yang, Tsung-Lin; Liu, Xinxing; Hulet, Randall G.] Rice Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Hart, Russell A.; Duarte, Pedro M.; Yang, Tsung-Lin; Liu, Xinxing; Hulet, Randall G.] Rice Univ, Rice Quantum Inst, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Paiva, Thereza] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Fis, BR-21941972 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Khatami, Ehsan] San Jose State Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, San Jose, CA 95192 USA; [Scalettar, Richard T.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Phys, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Trivedi, Nandini] Ohio State Univ, Dept Phys, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Huse, David A.] Princeton Univ, Dept Phys, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Hulet, RG (reprint author), Rice Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, 6100 Main St, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",randy@rice.edu,"Paiva, Thereza/B-9778-2013; Khatami, Ehsan/G-9565-2012","Paiva, Thereza/0000-0002-4199-3809; ",ARO [W911NF-13-1-0018]; DARPA OLE; NSF; ONR; Welch Foundation [C-1133]; ARO-MURI [W911NF-14-1-003]; CNPq; FAPERJ; INCT on Quantum Information; Office of the President of the University of California,"This work was supported under ARO grant no.

However, the dynamics underlying these evolutionary processes remain poorly understood because they involve many competing beneficial lineages, most of which never rise above extremely low frequencies in the population. To observe these normally hidden evolutionary dynamics, we constructed a sequencing-based ultra high-resolution lineage tracking system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that allowed us to monitor the relative frequencies of similar to 500,000 lineages simultaneously. In contrast to some expectations, we found that the spectrum of fitness effects of beneficial mutations is neither exponential nor monotonic. Early adaptation is a predictable consequence of this spectrum and is strikingly reproducible, but the initial small-effect mutations are soon outcompeted by rarer large-effect mutations that result in variability between replicates. These results suggest that early evolutionary dynamics may be deterministic for a period of time before stochastic effects become important.","[Levy, Sasha F.; Sherlock, Gavin] Stanford Univ, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Levy, Sasha F.] SUNY Stony Brook, Laufer Ctr Phys & Quantitat Biol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Levy, Sasha F.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Biochem & Cellular Biol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Blundell, Jamie R.; Fisher, Daniel S.] Stanford Univ, Dept Appl Phys, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Blundell, Jamie R.; Venkataram, Sandeep; Petrov, Dmitri A.; Fisher, Daniel S.] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Fisher, DS (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Appl Phys, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",dsfisher@stanford.edu; gsherloc@stanford.edu,,"Sherlock, Gavin/0000-0002-1692-4983; Venkataram, Sandeep/0000-0002-2012-2633; Petrov, Dmitri/0000-0002-3664-9130","NIH [R01 HG003328, 5-T32-HG-44-17, R25 GM067110]; NSF [DMS-1120699, PHY-1305433]; Stanford University [Bio-X IIP6-63]; Betty Moore Foundation [2919]; Louis and Beatrice Laufer Center","The authors thank M.

This is achieved in part by Notum, a highly conserved secreted feedback antagonist. Notum has been thought to act as a phospholipase, shedding glypicans and associated Wnt proteins from the cell surface. However, this view fails to explain specificity, as glypicans bind many extracellular ligands. Here we provide genetic evidence in Drosophila that Notum requires glypicans to suppress Wnt signalling, but does not cleave their glycophosphatidylinositol anchor. Structural analyses reveal glycosaminoglycan binding sites on Notum, which probably help Notum to co-localize with Wnt proteins. They also identify, at the active site of human and Drosophila Notum, a large hydrophobic pocket that accommodates palmitoleate. Kinetic and mass spectrometric analyses of human proteins show that Notum is a carboxylesterase that removes an essential palmitoleate moiety from Wnt proteins and thus constitutes the first known extracellular protein deacylase.","[Kakugawa, Satoshi; Langton, Paul F.; Howell, Steven A.; Vincent, Jean-Paul] MRCs Natl Inst Med Res, London NW7 1AA, England; [Zebisch, Matthias; Chang, Tao -Hsin; Jones, E.

Here we show that the purified Cas1-Cas2 complex integrates oligonucleotide DNA substrates into acceptor DNA to yield products similar to those generated by retroviral integrases and transposases. Cas1 is the catalytic subunit and Cas2 substantially increases integration activity. Protospacer DNA with free 3'-OH ends and supercoiled target DNA are required, and integration occurs preferentially at the ends of CRISPR repeats and at sequences adjacent to cruciform structures abutting AT-rich regions, similar to the CRISPR leader sequence. Our results demonstrate the Cas1-Cas2 complex to be the minimal machinery that catalyses spacer DNA acquisition and explain the significance of CRISPR repeats in providing sequence and structural specificity for Cas1-Cas2-mediated adaptive immunity.","[Nunez, James K.; Lee, Amy S.

Upon infection, short phage sequences known as spacers integrate between CRISPR repeats and are transcribed into small RNA molecules that guide the Cas9 nuclease to the viral targets (protospacers). Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 cleavage of the viral genome requires the presence of a 5'-NGG-3' protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence immediately downstream of the viral target. It is not known whether and how viral sequences flanked by the correct PAM are chosen as new spacers. Here we show that Cas9 selects functional spacers by recognizing their PAM during spacer acquisition. The replacement of cas9 with alleles that lack the PAM recognition motif or recognize an NGGNG PAM eliminated or changed PAM specificity during spacer acquisition, respectively. Cas9 associates with other proteins of the acquisition machinery (Cas1, Cas2 and Csn2), presumably to provide PAM-specificity to this process.

Cooling can be regulated by feedback from accretion of cooling gas onto the central black hole, but requires an accretion rate finely tuned to the thermodynamic state of the hot gas(6,7). Theoretical models in which cold clouds precipitate out of the hot gas via thermal instability and accrete onto the black hole exhibit the necessary tuning(8-10). Recent observational evidence shows that the abundance of cold gas in the centres of clusters increases rapidly near the predicted threshold for instability(11). Here we report observations showing that this precipitation threshold extends over a large range in cluster radius, cluster mass and cosmic time. We incorporate the precipitation threshold into a framework of theoretical models for the thermodynamic state of hot gas in galaxy clusters. According to that framework, precipitation regulates star formation in some giant galaxies, while thermal conduction prevents star formation in others if it can compensate for radiative cooling and shut off precipitation.","[Voit, G.

Gravitational field measurements suggest a regional south polar subsurface ocean of about 10 kilometres thickness located beneath an ice crust 30 to 40 kilometres thick(3). These findings imply rock-water interactions in regions surrounding the core of Enceladus. The resulting chemical 'footprints' are expected to be preserved in the liquid and subsequently transported upwards to the near-surface plume sources, where they eventually would be ejected and could be measured by a spacecraft(4). Here we report an analysis of silicon-rich, nanometre-sized dust particles(5-8) (so-called stream particles) that stand out from the water-ice-dominated objects characteristic of Saturn. We interpret these grains as nanometre-sized SiO2 (silica) particles, initially embedded in icy grains emitted from Enceladus' subsurface waters and released by sputter erosion in Saturn's E ring. The composition and the limited size range (2 to 8 nanometres in radius) of stream particles indicate ongoing high-temperature (>90 degrees C) hydrothermal reactions associated with global-scale geothermal activity that quickly transports hydrothermal products from the ocean floor at a depth of at least 40 kilometres up to the plume of Enceladus.","[Hsu, Hsiang-Wen; Kempf, Sascha; Horanyi, Mihaly; Juhasz, Antal] Univ Colorado, Atmospher & Space Phys Lab, Boulder, CO 80303 USA; [Postberg, Frank] Heidelberg Univ, Inst Geowissensch, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Postberg, Frank; Moragas-Klostermeyer, Georg; Srama, Ralf] Univ Stuttgart, Inst Raumfahrtsyst, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany; [Sekine, Yasuhito] Univ Tokyo, Dept Complex Sci & Engn, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778561, Japan; [Shibuya, Takazo] JAMSTEC, Lab Ocean Earth Life Evolut Res, Yokosuka, Kanagawa 2370061, Japan; [Juhasz, Antal] Wigner RCP, Inst Particle & Nucl Phys, H-1121 Budapest, Hungary; [Altobelli, Nicolas] European Space Agcy, E-28691 Madrid, Spain; [Suzuki, Katsuhiko; Masaki, Yuka] JAMSTEC, Res & Dev Ctr Submarine Resources, Yokosuka, Kanagawa 2370061, Japan; [Kuwatani, Tatsu] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Sendai, Miyagi 9808579, Japan; [Tachibana, Shogo] Hokkaido Univ, Dept Nat Hist Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan; [Sirono, Sin-iti] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Environm Sci, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan","Hsu, HW (reprint author), Univ Colorado, Atmospher & Space Phys Lab, Boulder, CO 80303 USA.",sean.hsu@lasp.colorado.edu,,,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Astrobiology Program of the National Institutes of Natural Sciences, Japan; DLR [50 OH1103]","We acknowledge support from the CDA team, the Cassini project, and NASA.

At present, such dilute lakes release similar to 1.4 petagrams of carbon annually to the atmosphere(3,4), and this carbon efflux may increase in the future in response to elevated temperatures(5) and increased hydrological delivery of mineralizable dissolved organic matter to lakes(6,7). Much less is known about the potential effects of climate changes on carbon fluxes from carbonate-rich hardwater and saline lakes that account for about 20 per cent of inland water surface area(4,8). Here we show that atmospheric warming may reduce CO2 emissions from hardwater lakes. We analyse decadal records of meteorological variability, CO2 fluxes and water chemistry to investigate the processes affecting variations in pH and carbon exchange(9,10) in hydrologically diverse lakes of central North America. We find that the lakes have shifted progressively from being substantial CO2 sources in the mid-1990s to sequestering CO2 by 2010, with a steady increase in annual mean pH. We attribute the observed changes in pH and CO2 uptake to an atmospheric-warming induced decline in ice cover in spring that decreases CO2 accumulation under ice, increases spring and summer pH, and enhances the chemical uptake of CO2 in hardwater lakes. Our study suggests that rising temperatures do not invariably increase CO2 emissions from aquatic ecosystems.","[Finlay, Kerri; Vogt, Richard J.; Bogard, Matthew J.; Leavitt, Peter R.] Univ Regina, Dept Biol, Limnol Lab, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada; [Wissel, Bjoern; Simpson, Gavin L.; Leavitt, Peter R.] Univ Regina, Inst Environm Change & Soc, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada; [Tutolo, Benjamin M.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Earth Sci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Leavitt, PR (reprint author), Univ Regina, Dept Biol, Limnol Lab, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada.",peter.leavitt@uregina.ca,"Leavitt, Peter/A-1048-2013","Leavitt, Peter/0000-0001-9805-9307; Simpson, Gavin/0000-0002-9084-8413",NSERC Canada; Canada Foundation for Innovation; Province of Saskatchewan; Canada Research Chair programme,"We thank I.

Of the three germ layers, the mesoderm is found in bilaterian animals but is absent in species in the phyla Cnidaria and Ctenophora, which has been taken as evidence that the mesoderm was the final germ layer to evolve(1,4,5). The origin of the ectoderm and endoderm germ layers, however, remains unclear, with models supporting the antecedence of each as well as a simultaneous origin(4,6-9). Here we determine the temporal and spatial components of gene expression spanning embryonic development for all Caenorhabditis elegans genes and use it to determine the evolutionary ages of the germ layers. The gene expression program of the mesoderm is induced after those of the ectoderm and endoderm, thus making it the last germ layer both to evolve and to develop. Strikingly, the C. elegans endoderm and ectoderm expression programs do not co-induce; rather the endoderm activates earlier, and this is also observed in the expression of endoderm orthologues during the embryology of the frog Xenopus tropicalis, the sea anemone Nema-tostella vectensis and the sponge Amphimedon queenslandica. Querying the phylogenetic ages of specifically expressed genes reveals that the endoderm comprises older genes. Taken together, we propose that the endoderm program dates back to the origin of multicellularity, whereas the ectoderm originated as a secondary germ layer freed from ancestral feeding functions.","[Hashimshony, Tamar; Feder, Martin; Levin, Michal; Yanai, Itai] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Dept Biol, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel; [Hall, Brian K.] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS B3H 4J1, Canada","Yanai, I (reprint author), Technion Israel Inst Technol, Dept Biol, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel.",yanai@technion.ac.il,,"Yanai, Itai/0000-0002-8438-2741",European Research Council grant (EvoDevoPaths); EMBO Young Investigator Program,"We acknowledge the contribution of computational analyses by D.

Particularly challenging are those disorders rare enough to have eluded recognition as a discrete clinical entity, those with highly variable clinical manifestations, and those that are difficult to distinguish from other, very similar, disorders. Here we demonstrate the power of using an unbiased genotype-driven approach(2) to identify subsets of patients with similar disorders. By studying 1,133 children with severe, undiagnosed developmental disorders, and their parents, using a combination of exome sequencing(3-11) and array-based detection of chromosomal rearrangements, we discovered 12 novel genes associated with developmental disorders. These newly implicated genes increase by 10% (from 28% to 31%) the proportion of children that could be diagnosed. Clustering of missense mutations in six of these newly implicated genes suggests that normal development is being perturbed by an activating or dominant-negative mechanism. Our findings demonstrate the value of adopting a comprehensive strategy, both genome-wide and nationwide, to elucidate the underlying causes of rare genetic disorders.","[Fitzgerald, T.

Each retinal ganglion cell type tessellates the retina in a regular mosaic, so that every point in visual space is processed for visual primitives such as contrast and motion(3). This information flows to two principal brain centres: the visual cortex and the superior colliculus. The superior colliculus plays an evolutionarily conserved role in visual behaviours(4), but its functional architecture is poorly understood. Here we report on population recordings of visual responses from neurons in the mouse superior colliculus. Many neurons respond preferentially to lines of a certain orientation or movement axis. We show that cells with similar orientation preferences form large patches that span the vertical thickness of the retinorecipient layers. This organization is strikingly different from the randomly interspersed orientation preferences in the mouse's visual cortex(5); instead, it resembles the orientation columns observed in the visual cortices of large mammals(6-8). Notably, adjacent superior colliculus orientation columns have only limited receptive field overlap. This is in contrast to the organization of visual cortex, where each point in the visual field activates neurons with all preferred orientations(9). Instead, the superior colliculus favours specific contour orientations within similar to 30 degrees regions of the visual field, a finding with implications for behavioural responses mediated by this brain centre.","[Feinberg, Evan H.; Meister, Markus] Harvard Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Ctr Brain Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Meister, Markus] CALTECH, Div Biol & Biol Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Meister, M (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Ctr Brain Sci, 52 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",evan_feinberg@post.harvard.edu; meister@caltech.edu,,"Meister, Markus/0000-0003-2136-6506",NIH [T32 NS007484]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute-Helen Hay Whitney Foundation fellowship; NIH,"We thank E.

Experimental and theoretical investigations of schooling fish, flocking birds and human crowds have demonstrated that simple interactions between individuals can explain emergent group dynamics(3,4). These findings indicate the existence of neural circuits that support distributed behaviours, but the molecular and cellular identities of relevant sensory pathways are unknown. Here we show that Drosophila melanogaster exhibits collective responses to an aversive odour: individual flies weakly avoid the stimulus, but groups show enhanced escape reactions. Using high-resolution behavioural tracking, computational simulations, genetic perturbations, neural silencing and optogenetic activation we demonstrate that this collective odour avoidance arises from cascades of appendage touch interactions between pairs of flies. Interfly touch sensing and collective behaviour require the activity of distal leg mechanosensory sensilla neurons and the mechanosensory channel NOMPC5,6. Remarkably, through these inter-fly encounters, wild-type flies can elicit avoidance behaviour in mutant animals that cannot sense the odour-a basic form of communication. Our data highlight the unexpected importance of social context in the sensory responses of a solitary species and open the door to a neural-circuit-level understanding of collective behaviour in animal groups.","[Ramdya, Pavan; Cruchet, Steeve; Benton, Richard] Univ Lausanne, Fac Biol & Med, Ctr Integrat Genom, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Ramdya, Pavan; Lichocki, Pawel; Floreano, Dario] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lab Intelligent Syst, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Lichocki, Pawel] Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Frisch, Lukas; Tse, Winnie] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Masters Program Microengn, Inst Microengn, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","Benton, R (reprint author), Univ Lausanne, Fac Biol & Med, Ctr Integrat Genom, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",ramdya@gmail.com; Richard.Benton@unil.ch,,,"Human Frontier Science Program Long-term Fellowship; Swiss National Science Foundation [200021_127143, CR32I3_141063/1]; FP7-FET European Project INSIGHT [308943]; European Research Council [205202, 615094]","We thank L.

Although they are classically activated by immunoglobulin (Ig)E antibodies, a unique property of mast cells is their antibody-independent responsiveness to a range of cationic substances, collectively called basic secretagogues, including inflammatory peptides and drugs associated with allergic-type reactions(1,3). The pathogenic roles of these substances have prompted a decades-long search for their receptor(s). Here we report that basic secretagogues activate mouse mast cells in vitro and in vivo through a single receptor, Mrgprb2, the orthologue of the human G-protein-coupled receptor MRGPRX2. Secretagogue-induced histamine release, inflammation and airway contraction are abolished in Mrgprb2-null mutant mice. Furthermore, we show that most classes of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved peptidergic drugs associated with allergic-type injection-site reactions also activate Mrgprb2 and MRGPRX2, and that injection-site inflammation is absent in mutant mice. Finally, we determine that Mrgprb2 and MRGPRX2 are targets of many small-molecule drugs associated with systemic pseudo-allergic, or anaphylactoid, reactions; we show that drug-induced symptoms of anaphylactoid responses are significantly reduced in knockout mice; and we identify a common chemical motif in several of these molecules that may help predict side effects of other compounds. These discoveries introduce a mouse model to study mast cell activation by basic secretagogues and identify MRGPRX2 as a potential therapeutic target to reduce a subset of drug-induced adverse effects.","[McNeil, Benjamin D.; Han, Liang; Dong, Xinzhong] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosurg, Solomon H Snyder Dept Neurosci,Ctr Sensory Biol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Pundir, Priyanka; Kulka, Marianna] Univ Alberta, Dept Med Microbiol & Immunol, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E1, Canada; [Meeker, Sonya; Undem, Bradley J.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Allergy & Clin Immunol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Kulka, Marianna] Natl Res Council Canada, Natl Inst Nanotechnol, Edmonton, AB T6G 2M9, Canada; [Dong, Xinzhong] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Dong, XZ (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosurg, Solomon H Snyder Dept Neurosci,Ctr Sensory Biol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",xdong2@jhmi.edu,,"McNeil, Benjamin/0000-0001-7545-3598","National Institutes of Health [R01NS054791, R01GM087369]",We thank C.

Emerging studies indicate that immune cells, including monocytes, granulocytes and lymphocytes, regulate metabolic homeostasis and are dysregulated in obesity(1,2). Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) can regulate adaptive immunity(3,4) and eosinophil and alternatively activated macrophage responses(5), and were recently identified in murine white adipose tissue (WAT)(5) where they may act to limit the development of obesity(6). However, ILC2s have not been identified inhuman adipose tissue, and the mechanisms by which ILC2s regulate metabolic homeostasis remain unknown. Here we identify ILC2s in human WAT and demonstrate that decreased ILC2 responses in WAT are a conserved characteristic of obesity in humans and mice. Interleukin (IL)-33 was found to be critical for the maintenance of ILC2s in WAT and in limiting adiposity in mice by increasing caloric expenditure. This was associated with recruitment of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)(+) beige adipocytes in WAT, a process known as beiging or browning that regulates caloric expenditure(7-9). IL-33-induced beiging was dependent on ILC2s, and IL-33 treatment or transfer of IL-33-elicited ILC2s was sufficient to drive beiging independently of the adaptive immune system, eosinophils or IL-4 receptor signalling. We found that ILC2s produce methionine-enkephalin peptides that can act directly on adipocytes to upregulate Ucp1 expression in vitro and that promote beiging in vivo. Collectively, these studies indicate that, in addition to responding to infection or tissue damage, ILC2s can regulate adipose function and metabolic homeostasis in part via production of enkephalin peptides that elicit beiging.","[Brestoff, Jonathan R.; Monticelli, Laurel A.; Sonnenberg, Gregory F.; Artis, David] Cornell Univ, Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Jill Roberts Inst Res IBD,Joan & Sanford I Weill, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Brestoff, Jonathan R.; Kim, Brian S.; Saenz, Steven A.; Monticelli, Laurel A.; Artis, David] Univ Penn, Dept Microbiol, Perelman Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Brestoff, Jonathan R.; Kim, Brian S.; Saenz, Steven A.; Monticelli, Laurel A.; Artis, David] Univ Penn, Inst Immunol, Perelman Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Stine, Rachel R.; Seale, Patrick] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Inst Diabet Obes & Metab, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Thome, Joseph J.; Farber, Donna L.] Columbia Univ, Med Ctr, Columbia Ctr Translat Immunol, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Thome, Joseph J.; Farber, Donna L.] Columbia Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Farber, Donna L.] Columbia Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Surg, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Lutfy, Kabirullah] Western Univ Hlth Sci, Coll Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Pomona, CA 91766 USA","Artis, D (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Jill Roberts Inst Res IBD,Joan & Sanford I Weill, New York, NY 10021 USA.",dartis@med.cornell.edu,,"Brestoff, Jonathan/0000-0002-7018-7400","National Institutes of Health [AI061570, AI074878, AI095466, AI095608, AI102942, AI097333]; Burroughs Wellcome Fund Investigator in Pathogenesis of Infectious Disease Award; Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America; NIH [F30-AI112023, T32-AI060516, T32-AI007532, KL2-RR024132, DP5OD012116, P01AI06697, F31AG047003, DP2OD007288]; Searle Scholars Award; Penn Diabetes Endocrine Research Center [P30DK19525]; NCI Comprehensive Cancer Center Support Grant [2-P30 CA016520]; NIH/NIDDK P30 Center for Molecular Studies in Digestive and Liver Diseases [P30-DK050306]","The authors wish to thank members of the Artis laboratory for the critical reading of this manuscript.

Here, using lipid-mediated crystallization and protein engineering with a novel fusion chimaera, we solved the structure of the human OX2R bound to suvorexant at 2.5 angstrom resolution. The structure reveals how suvorexant adopts pi-stacked horseshoe-like conformation and binds to the receptor deep in the orthosteric pocket, stabilizing a network of extracellular salt bridges and blocking transmembrane helix motions necessary for activation. Computational docking suggests how other classes of synthetic antagonists may interact with the receptor at a similar position in an analogous pi-stacked fashion. Elucidation of the molecular architecture of the human OX2R expands our understanding of peptidergic GPCR ligand recognition and will aid further efforts to modulate orexin signalling for therapeutic ends.","[Yin, Jie; Rosenbaum, Daniel M.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Biophys, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Mobarec, Juan Carlos; Kolb, Peter] Univ Marburg, Dept Pharmaceut Chem, D-35032 Marburg, Germany","Rosenbaum, DM (reprint author), Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Biophys, Dallas, TX 75390 USA.",dan.rosenbaum@utsouthwestern.edu,"Kolb, Peter/A-3782-2008; Ying, Chieh/E-4296-2016; Yin, Jie/J-8932-2016","Kolb, Peter/0000-0003-4089-614X; Mobarec, Juan Carlos/0000-0001-9482-4294",Welch Foundation [I-1770]; Searle Scholars Program; Packard Foundation Fellowship; Emmy Noether Fellowship of the German Research Foundation [KO-4095/1-1]; COST Action GLISTEN [CM1207]; National Cancer Institute [ACB-12002]; National Institute of General Medical Sciences [AGM-12006],"We acknowledge support from the Welch Foundation (I-1770 to D.M.R.), the Searle Scholars Program (D.M.R.), a Packard Foundation Fellowship (D.M.R.), an Emmy Noether Fellowship of the German Research Foundation (KO-4095/1-1 to P.K.) and COST Action GLISTEN (CM1207 to P.K.).

Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) is critical for the central regulation of food intake. Here we test whether CB1R-controlled feeding in sated mice is paralleled by decreased activity of POMC neurons. We show that chemical promotion of CB1R activity increases feeding, and notably, CB1R activation also promotes neuronal activity of POMC cells. This paradoxical increase in POMC activity was crucial for CB1R-induced feeding, because designer-receptors-exclusively-activated-by-designer-drugs (DREADD)-mediated inhibition of POMC neurons diminishes, whereas DREADD-mediated activation of POMC neurons enhances CB1R-driven feeding. The Pomc gene encodes both the anorexigenic peptide alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, and the opioid peptide beta-endorphin. CB1R activation selectively increases beta-endorphin but not alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone release in the hypothalamus, and systemic or hypothalamic administration of the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone blocks acute CB1R-induced feeding. These processes involve mitochondrial adaptations that, when blocked, abolish CB1R-induced cellular responses and feeding. Together, these results uncover a previously unsuspected role of POMC neurons in the promotion of feeding by cannabinoids.","[Koch, Marco; Varela, Luis; Kim, Jae Geun; Kim, Jung Dae; Hernandez-Nuno, Francisco; Szigeti-Buck, Klara; Dietrich, Marcelo O.; Gao, Xiao-Bing; Diano, Sabrina; Horvath, Tamas L.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Sect Comparat Med, Program Integrat Cell Signaling & Neurobiol Metab, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Koch, Marco; Bechmann, Ingo] Univ Leipzig, Inst Anat, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Kim, Jung Dae; Diano, Sabrina; Horvath, Tamas L.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Obstet Gynecol & Reprod Sci, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Simonds, Stephanie E.; Cowley, Michael A.] Monash Univ, Dept Physiol, Obes & Diabet Inst, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Castorena, Carlos M.; Vianna, Claudia R.; Elmquist, Joel K.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Internal Med, Div Endocrinol & Metab, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Morozov, Yury M.; Rakic, Pasko; Dietrich, Marcelo O.; Diano, Sabrina; Horvath, Tamas L.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Rakic, Pasko; Horvath, Tamas L.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Kavli Inst Neurosci, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Horvath, TL (reprint author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, Sect Comparat Med, Program Integrat Cell Signaling & Neurobiol Metab, 333 Cedar St, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",tamas.horvath@yale.edu,"Dietrich, Marcelo/A-9928-2009; Cowley, Michael/B-9428-2008","Dietrich, Marcelo/0000-0001-9781-2221; Cowley, Michael/0000-0001-7811-134X","US National Institutes of Health [DP1 DK098058, R01 DK097566, R01 AG040236, P01 NS062686]; American Diabetes Association; Klarmann Family Foundation; Helmholtz Society (ICEMED); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB 1052/1]","The authors thank M.

An anterior lateral region of the mouse cortex (a possible homologue of prernotor cortex in primates) contains equal proportions of intermingled neurons predicting ipsi- or contralateral movements, yet unilateral inactivation of this cortical region during movement planning disrupts contralateral movements. Using cell-type-specific electrophysiology, cellular imaging and optogenetic perturbation, we show that layer 5 neurons projecting within the cortex have unbiased laterality. Activity with a contralateral population bias arises specifically in layer 5 neurons projecting to the brairtstern, and only late during movement planning.

Through YAP and Notch, intestinal gp130 signalling stimulates epithelial cell proliferation, causes aberrant differentiation and confers resistance to mucosal erosion. gp130 associates with the related tyrosine kinases Src and Yes, which are activated on receptor engagement to phosphorylate YAP and induce its stabilization and nuclear translocation.

The origin of their complex morphologies is poorly understood(1), although several mechanisms involving binary interaction have been proposed(2,3). In close binary systems, the orbital separation is short enough for the primary star to overfill its Roche lobe as the star expands during the asymptotic giant branch phase. The excess gas eventually forms a common envelope surrounding both stars. Drag forces then result in the envelope being ejected into a bipolar planetary nebula whose equator is coincident with the orbital plane of the system. Systems in which both stars have ejected their envelopes and are evolving towards the white dwarf stage are said to be double degenerate. Here we report that Henize 2-428 has a double-degenerate core with a combined mass of similar to 1.76M(circle dot), which is above the Chandrasekhar limit (the maximum mass of a stable white dwarf) of 1.4M(circle dot). This, together with its short orbital period (4.2 hours), suggests that the system should merge in 700 million years, triggering a type Ia supernova event. This supports the hypothesis of the double-degenerate, super-Chandrasekhar evolutionary pathway for the formation of type Ia supernovae(4).","[Santander-Garcia, M.] Observ Astron Nacl, E-28803 Alcala De Henares, Spain; [Santander-Garcia, M.] CSIC, Inst Ciencia Mat Madrid, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Rodriguez-Gil, P.; Corradi, R.

If quantum bits (qubits) are sufficiently reliable, errors are sparse and quantum error correction (QEC)(1-6) is capable of identifying and correcting them. Adding more qubits improves the preservation of states by guaranteeing that increasingly larger clusters of errors will not cause logical failure a key requirement for large-scale systems. Using QEC to extend the qubit lifetime remains one of the outstanding experimental challenges in quantum computing. Here we report the protection of classical states from environmental bit-flip errors and demonstrate the suppression of these errors with increasing system size. We use a linear array of nine qubits, which is a natural step towards the two-dimensional surface code QEC scheme(7), and track errors as they occur by repeatedly performing projective quantum non-demolition parity measurements. Relative to a single physical qubit, we reduce the failure rate in retrieving an input state by a factor of 2.7 when using five of our nine qubits and by a factor of 8.5 when using all nine qubits after eight cycles. Additionally, we tomographically verify preservation of the non-classical Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state. The successful suppression of environment-induced errors will motivate further research into the many challenges associated with building a large-scale superconducting quantum computer.","[Kelly, J.; Barends, R.; Fowler, A.

The ability of such pores to coordinate multiphase transport, in a highly selective and subtly triggered fashion and without clogging, has inspired interest in synthetic gated pores for applications ranging from fluid processing to 3D printing and lab-on-chip systems(1-10). But although specific gating and transport behaviours have been realized by precisely tailoring pore surface chemistries and pore geometries(6,11-17), a single system capable of controlling complex, selective multiphase transport has remained a distant prospect, and fouling is nearly inevitable(11,12). Here we introduce a gating mechanism that uses a capillary-stabilized liquid as a reversible, reconfigurable gate that fills and seals pores in the closed state, and creates a non-fouling, liquid-lined pore in the open state. Theoretical modelling and experiments demonstrate that for each transport substance, the gating threshold-the pressure needed to open the pores-can be rationally tuned over a wide pressure range. This enables us to realize in one system differential response profiles for a variety of liquids and gases, even letting liquids flow through the pore while preventing gas from escaping. These capabilities allow us to dynamically modulate gas-liquid sorting in a microfluidic flow and to separate a three-phase air-water-oil mixture, with the liquid lining ensuring sustained antifouling behaviour. Because the liquid gating strategy enables efficient long-term operation and can be applied to a variety of pore structures and membrane materials, and to micro- as well as macroscale fluid systems, we expect it to prove useful in a wide range of applications.","[Hou, Xu; Hu, Yuhang; Grinthal, Alison; Aizenberg, Joanna] Harvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Hou, Xu; Khan, Mughees; Aizenberg, Joanna] Harvard Univ, Wyss Inst Biol Inspired Engn, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Aizenberg, J (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",jaiz@seas.harvard.edu,"Hu, Yuhang/E-5378-2010","Hu, Yuhang/0000-0002-2274-4903","Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), US Department of Energy [DE-AR0000326]","This work was supported in part by the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), US Department of Energy, under award number DE-AR0000326.

The appeal of such transformations derives from their capacity to facilitate the construction of complex organic molecules via the coupling of simple and otherwise inert building blocks, without introducing extraneous functional groups. Despite notable recent efforts', the establishment of general and mild strategies for the engagement of sp(3) C-H bonds in C-C bond forming reactions has proved difficult. Within this context, the discovery of chemical transformations that are able to directly functionalize allylic methyl, methylene and methine carbons in a catalytic manner is a priority. Although protocols for direct oxidation and amination of allylic C-H bonds (that is, C-H bonds where an adjacent carbon is involved in a C=C bond) have become widely established(2,3), the engagement of allylic substrates in C-C bond forming reactions has thus far required the use of pre-functionalized coupling partners'. In particular, the direct arylation of non-functionalized allylic systems would enable access to a series of known pharmacophores (molecular features responsible for a drug's action), though a general solution to this long-standing challenge remains elusive. Here we report the use of both photoredox and organic catalysis to accomplish a mild, broadly effective direct allylic C-H arylation. This C-C bond forming reaction readily accommodates abroad range of alkene and electron-deficient arene reactants, and has been used in the direct arylation of benzylic C-H bonds.","[Cuthbertson, James D.; MacMillan, David W.

Tree mortality increased after the 2005 drought(4), and regional atmospheric inversion modelling showed basin-wide decreases in CO2 uptake in 2010 compared with 2011 (ref. 5). But the response of tropical forest carbon cycling to these droughts is not fully understood and there has been no detailed multi-site investigation in situ. Here we use several years of data from a network of thirteen 1-ha forest plots spread throughout South America, where each component of net primary production (NPP), autotrophic respiration and heterotrophic respiration is measured separately, to develop a better mechanistic understanding of the impact of the 2010 drought on the Amazon forest. We find that total NPP remained constant throughout the drought. However, towards the end of the drought, autotrophic respiration, especially in roots and stems, declined significantly compared with measurements in 2009 made in the absence of drought, with extended decreases in autotrophic respiration in the three driest plots. In the year after the drought, total NPP remained constant but the allocation of carbon shifted towards canopy NPP and away from fine-root NPP. Both leaf-level and plot-level measurements indicate that severe drought suppresses photosynthesis. Scaling these measurements to the entire Amazon basin with rainfall data, we estimate that drought suppressed Amazon-wide photosynthesis in 2010 by 0.38 petagrams of carbon (0.23-0.53 petagrams of carbon). Overall, we find that during this drought, instead of reducing total NPP, trees prioritized growth by reducing autotrophic respiration that was unrelated to growth. This suggests that trees decrease investment in tissue maintenance and defence, in line with eco-evolutionary theories that trees are competitively disadvantaged in the absence of growth(6). We propose that weakened maintenance and defence investment may, in turn, cause the increase in post-drought tree mortality observed at our plots.","[Doughty, Christopher E.; Girardin, C. A.

In the latter case, however, there is no consensus over the respective groupings, and which of the two includes OH 7, the 1.8-million-year-old H. habilis holotype(7). This partial skull and hand from Olduvai Gorge remains pivotal to evaluating the early evolution of the Homo lineage, and by priority names one or other of the two taxa. However, the distorted preservation of the diagnostically important OH 7 mandible has hindered attempts to compare this specimen with other fossils(8,9). Here we present a virtual reconstruction of the OH 7 mandible, and compare it to other early Homo fossils. The reconstructed mandible is remarkably primitive, with a long and narrow dental arcade more similar to Australopithecus afarensis than to the derived parabolic arcades of Homo sapiens or H. erectus. We find that this shape variability is not consistent with a single species of early Homo. Importantly, the jaw morphology of OH 7 is incompatible with fossils assigned to Homo rudolfensiss(8) and with the A.L. 666-1 Homo maxilla. The latter is morphologically more derived than OH 7 but 500,000 years older(10), suggesting that the H. habilis lineage originated before 2.3 million years ago, thus marking deep-rooted species diversity in the genus Homo. We also reconstructed the parietal bones of OH 7 and estimated its endocranial volume. At between 729 and 824 ml it is larger than any previously published value, and emphasizes the near-complete overlap in brain size among species of early Homo. Our results clarify the H. habilis hypodigm, but raise questions about its phylogenetic relationships. Differences between species of early Homo appear to be characterized more by gnathic diversity than by differences in brain size, which was highly variable within all taxa.","[Spoor, Fred; Gunz, Philipp; Neubauer, Simon; Stelzer, Stefanie; Scott, Nadia] Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Anthropol, Dept Human Evolut, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Spoor, Fred; Dean, M.

Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors can stably express HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs)(1,2). However, even the best bNAbs neutralize 10-50% of HIV-1 isolates inefficiently (80% inhibitory concentration (IC80) > 5 mu g ml(-1)), suggesting that high concentrations of these antibodies would be necessary to achieve general protection(3-6). Here we show that eCD4-Ig, a fusion ofCD4-Ig with a small CCR5-mimetic sulfopeptide, binds avidly and cooperatively to the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) and is more potent than the best bNAbs (geometric mean half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50), 0.05 mu g ml(-1)). Because eCD4-Ig binds only conserved regions of Env, it is also much broader than any bNAb. For example, eCD4-Ig efficiently neutralized 100% of a diverse panel of neutralization-resistant HIV-1, HIV-2 and simian immunodeficiency virus isolates, including a comprehensive set of isolates resistant to the CD4-binding site bNAbs VRC01, NIH45-46 and 3BNC117. Rhesus macaques inoculated with an AAV vector stably expressed 17-77 mu g ml(-1) of fully functional rhesuseCD4-Ig for more than 40 weeks, and these macaques were protected from several infectious challenges with SHIV-AD8. Rhesus eCD4-Ig was also markedly less immunogenic than rhesus forms of four well-characterized bNAbs. Our data suggest that AAV-delivered eCD4-Ig can function like an effective HIV-1 vaccine.","[Gardner, Matthew R.; Kondur, Hema R.; Dorfman, Tatyana; Bailey, Charles C.; Fellinger, Christoph H.; Joshi, Vinita R.; Quinlan, Brian D.; Farzan, Michael] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Infect Dis, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA; [Kattenhorn, Lisa M.; Chiang, Jessica J.; Alpert, Michael D.; Neale, Ernest S., Jr.; Yao, Annie Y.; Desrosiers, Ronald C.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, New England Primate Res Ctr, Dept Comparat Pathol, Southborough, MA 01772 USA; [von Schaewen, Markus; Ploss, Alexander] Princeton Univ, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Haworth, Kevin G.; Cannon, Paula M.] Univ So Calif, Keck Sch Med, Dept Mol Microbiol & Immunol, Los Angeles, CA 90033 USA; [Decker, Julie M.; Hahn, Beatrice H.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Dept Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Decker, Julie M.; Hahn, Beatrice H.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Dept Microbiol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Alpert, Michael D.] Immunathon Inc, Cambridge, MA 02141 USA; [Fuchs, Sebastian P.; Martinez-Navio, Jose M.; Desrosiers, Ronald C.] Univ Miami, Miller Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Miami, FL 33136 USA; [Mouquet, Hugo; Nussenzweig, Michel C.] Rockefeller Univ, Lab Mol Immunol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Mouquet, Hugo] Inst Pasteur, Dept Immunol, F-75015 Paris, France; [Gorman, Jason; Zhang, Baoshan; Kwong, Peter D.] NIH, Vaccine Res Ctr, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Poignard, Pascal; Burton, Dennis R.] Scripps Res Inst, IAVI Neutralizing Antibody Ctr, Dept Immunol & Microbial Sci, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Poignard, Pascal; Burton, Dennis R.] Scripps Res Inst, Ctr HIV AIDS Vaccine Immunol & Immunogen Discover, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Nussenzweig, Michel C.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Burton, Dennis R.] Ragon Inst MGH MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Piatak, Michael, Jr.; Lifson, Jeffrey D.] Frederick Natl Lab Canc Res, AIDS & Canc Virus Program, Leidos Biomed Res Inc, Frederick, MD 21702 USA; [Gao, Guangping] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Gene Therapy Ctr, Worcester, MA 01655 USA; [Evans, David T.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Madison, WI 53711 USA; [Seaman, Michael S.] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Farzan, M (reprint author), Scripps Res Inst, Dept Infect Dis, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA.",mfarzan@scripps.edu,"Mouquet, Hugo/M-2750-2014; poignard, pascal/N-6678-2013; Fellinger, Christoph/M-9981-2017","Fellinger, Christoph/0000-0003-0242-9161; Gorman, Jason/0000-0002-3775-6560","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R01 AI091476, R01 AI080324, P01 AI100263, RR000168, RO1 AI058715]; Vaccine Research Center, NIAID, NIH; National Cancer Institute, NIH [HHSN261200800001E]","This project was supported by National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants R01 AI091476 and RO1 AI080324 (M.F.), P01 AI100263 (G.G., R.C.D., M.F.), RR000168 (M.R.G., L.M.K., D.T.E., R.C.D., M.F.), R01 AI058715 (B.H.H.), by the Intramural Research program of the Vaccine Research Center, NIAID, NIH (J.G., B.Z., P.D.K.), and by federal funds from the National Cancer Institute, NIH under contract no.

While the gut microbiota provides important benefits to its host, especially in metabolism and immune development, disturbance of the microbiota-host relationship is associated with numerous chronic inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease and the group of obesity-associated diseases collectively referred to as metabolic syndrome. A primary means by which the intestine is protected from its microbiota is via multi-layered mucus structures that cover the intestinal surface, thereby allowing the vast majority of gut bacteria to be kept at a safe distance from epithelial cells that line the intestine(1). Thus, agents that disrupt mucus-bacterial interactions might have the potential to promote diseases associated with gut inflammation. Consequently, it has been hypothesized that emulsifiers, detergent-like molecules that are a ubiquitous component of processed foods and that can increase bacterial translocation across epithelia in vitro(2), might be promoting the increase in inflammatory bowel disease observed since the mid-twentieth century(3). Here we report that, in mice, relatively low concentrations of two commonly used emulsifiers, namely carboxymethylcellulose and polysorbate-80, induced low-grade inflammation and obesity/metabolic syndrome in wild-type hosts and promoted robust colitis in mice predisposed to this disorder. Emulsifier-induced metabolic syndrome was associated with microbiota encroachment, altered species composition and increased pro-inflammatory potential. Use of germ-free mice and faecal transplants indicated that such changes in microbiota were necessary and sufficient for both low-grade inflammation and metabolic syndrome. These results support the emerging concept that perturbed host-microbiota interactions resulting in low-grade inflammation can promote adiposity and its associated metabolic effects. Moreover, they suggest that the broad use of emulsifying agents might be contributing to an increased societal incidence of obesity/metabolic syndrome and other chronic inflammatory diseases.","[Chassaing, Benoit; Gewirtz, Andrew T.] Georgia State Univ, Inst Biomed Sci, Ctr Inflammat Immun & Infect, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Koren, Omry] Bar Ilan Univ, Fac Med, IL-13115 Safed, Israel; [Goodrich, Julia K.; Poole, Angela C.; Ley, Ruth E.] Cornell Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Srinivasan, Shanthi] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Digest Dis Div, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA","Gewirtz, AT (reprint author), Georgia State Univ, Inst Biomed Sci, Ctr Inflammat Immun & Infect, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",agewirtz@gsu.edu,"Ley, Ruth/M-8542-2014; Chassaing, Benoit/R-3819-2017","Ley, Ruth/0000-0002-9087-1672; Chassaing, Benoit/0000-0002-4285-769X; Koren, Omry/0000-0002-7738-1337","NIH [DK099071, DK083890]; Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA)","This work was supported by NIH grant DK099071 and DK083890.

Reduced insulin/I GF-1 signalling (HIS) extends lifespan across the evolutionary spectrum, and in juvenile Caenorhabditis elegans also allows the transcription factor DAF-16/FOX0 to induce development into dauer, a diapause that withstands harsh conditions(1,2). It has been suggested that rIIS delays C. elegans ageing through activation of dauer-related processes during adulthood(2,8,9), but some HIS conditions confer robust lifespan extension unaccompanied by any dauer-like traits(1,10,11). Here we show that HIS can promote C. elegans longevity through a program that is genetically distinct from the dauer pathway, and requires the Nrf (NF-E2-related factor) orthologue SKN-1 acting in parallel to DAF-16. SKN-1 is inhibited by IIS and has been broadly implicated in longevity(12-14), but is rendered dispensable for HIS lifespan extension by even mild activity of dauer-related processes. When IIS is decreased under conditions that do not induce dauer traits, SKN-1 most prominently increases expression of collagens and other extracellular matrix genes. Diverse genetic, nutritional, and pharmacological pro-longevity interventions delay an age-related decline in collagen expression. These collagens mediate adulthood extracellular matrix remodelling, and are needed for ageing to be delayed by interventions that do not involve dauer traits. By genetically delineating a dauer-independent HIS ageing pathway, our results show that IIS controls a broad set of protective mechanisms during C. elegans adulthood, and may facilitate elucidation of processes of general importance for longevity. The importance of collagen production in diverse anti-ageing interventions implies that extracellular matrix remodelling is a generally essential signature of longevity assurance, and that agents promoting extracellular matrix youthfulness may have systemic benefit.","[Ewald, Collin Y.; Abate, Jess Porter; Blackwell, T.

Introduction of ABL1 kinase inhibitors (for example, imatinib) has markedly improved patient survival(2), but acquired drug resistance remains a challenge(3-5). Point mutations in the ABL1 kinase domain weaken inhibitor binding(6) and represent the most common clinical resistance mechanism. The BCR-ABLI kinase domain gatekeeper mutation Thr315Ile (T315I) confers resistance to all approved ABL1 inhibitors except ponatinib(7,8), which has toxicity limitations. Here we combine comprehensive drug sensitivity and resistance profiling of patient cells ex vivo with structural analysis to establish the VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor axitinib as a selective and effective inhibitor for T315I-mutant BCR-ABL1-driven leukaemia. Axitinib potently inhibited BCR-ABL1(T315I), at both biochemical and cellular levels, by binding to the active form of ABL1 (T315I) in a mutation-selective binding mode. These findings suggest that the T315I mutation shifts the conformational equilibrium of the kinase in favour of an active (DFG-in) A-loop conformation, which has more optimal binding interactions with axitinib. Treatment of a T315I chronic myeloid leukaemia patient with axitinib resulted in a rapid reduction of T315I-positive cells from bone marrow. Taken together, our findings demonstrate an unexpected opportunity to repurpose axitinib, an anti-angiogenic drug approved for renal cancer, as an inhibitor for ABL1 gatekeeper mutant drug-resistant leukaemia patients. This study shows that wild-type proteins do not always sample the conformations available to disease-relevant mutant proteins and that comprehensive drug testing of patient-derived cells can identify unpredictable, clinically significant drug-repositioning opportunities.","[Pemovska, Tea; Repasky, Gretchen A.; Kallioniemi, Olli; Wennerberg, Krister] Univ Helsinki, Inst Mol Med Finland FIMM, FIN-00290 Helsinki, Finland; [Johnson, Eric; Chen, Jeffrey; Wells, Peter; Cronin, Ciaran N.; McTigue, Michele; Murray, Brion W.] Pfizer Worldwide Res & Dev, La Jolla Labs, San Diego, CA 92121 USA; [Kontro, Mika; Porkka, Kimmo] Univ Helsinki, Hematol Res Unit Helsinki, FIN-00290 Helsinki, Finland; [Kontro, Mika; Porkka, Kimmo] Helsinki Univ Hosp, Dept Hematol, Ctr Comprehens Canc, Helsinki 00290, Finland","Wennerberg, K (reprint author), Univ Helsinki, Inst Mol Med Finland FIMM, FIN-00290 Helsinki, Finland.",brion.murray@pfizer.com; krister.wennerberg@fimm.fi,"Kallioniemi, Olli/H-5111-2011","Kallioniemi, Olli/0000-0002-3231-0332; Wennerberg, Krister/0000-0002-1352-4220; Pemovska, Tea/0000-0003-2951-4905",Jane and Aatos Erkko Foundation; Academy of Finland; Finnish Cancer Societies; Sigrid Juselius Foundation; Instrumentarium Foundation; FinPharma Doctoral Program-Drug Discovery section,"We would like to thank the patients and their families for participating in this study and donating their samples for research.

Although they lack stable tertiary structure, many intrinsically disordered proteins undergo disorder-to-order transitions upon binding to partners(3,4). Similarly, several folded proteins use regulated order-to-disorder transitions to mediate biological function(5,6). In principle, the function of intrinsically disordered proteins may be controlled by post-translational modifications that lead to structural changes such as folding, although this has not been observed. Here we show that multisite phosphorylation induces folding of the intrinsically disordered 4E-BP2, the major neural isoform of the family of three mammalian proteins that bind eIF4E and suppress cap-dependent translation initiation. In its non-phosphorylated state, 4E-BP2 interacts tightly with eIF4E using both a canonical YXXXXL Phi motif (starting at Y54) that undergoes a disorder-to-helix transition upon binding and a dynamic secondary binding site(7-11). We demonstrate that phosphorylation at T37 and T46 induces folding of residues P18-R62 of 4E-BP2 into a four-stranded beta-domain that sequesters the helical YXXXXL Phi motif into a partly buried beta-strand, blocking its accessibility to eIF4E. The folded state of pT37pT46 4E-BP2 is wealdy stable, decreasing affinity by 100-fold and leading to an order-to-disorder transition upon binding to eIF4E, whereas fully phosphorylated 4E-BP2 is more stable, decreasing affinity by a factor of approximately 4,000. These results highlight stabilization of a phosphorylation-induced fold as the essential mechanism for phospho-regulation of the 4E-BP:eIF4E interaction and exemplify a new mode of biological regulation mediated by intrinsically disordered proteins.","[Bah, Alaji; Vernon, Robert M.; Siddiqui, Zeba; Krzeminski, Mickael; Zhao, Charlie; Kay, Lewis E.; Forman-Kay, Julie D.] Hosp Sick Children, Mol Struct & Funct Program, Toronto, ON M5G 0A4, Canada; [Bah, Alaji; Vernon, Robert M.; Krzeminski, Mickael; Muhandiram, Ranjith; Kay, Lewis E.; Forman-Kay, Julie D.] Univ Toronto, Dept Biochem, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [Muhandiram, Ranjith; Kay, Lewis E.] Univ Toronto, Dept Mol Genet, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [Sonenberg, Nahum] McGill Univ, Dept Biochem, Montreal, PQ H3G 1Y6, Canada; [Sonenberg, Nahum] McGill Univ, Goodman Canc Res Ctr, Montreal, PQ H3G 1Y6, Canada; [Kay, Lewis E.] Univ Toronto, Dept Chem, Toronto, ON M5S 3H6, Canada","Forman-Kay, JD (reprint author), Hosp Sick Children, Mol Struct & Funct Program, Toronto, ON M5G 0A4, Canada.",forman@sickkids.ca,,"Forman-Kay, Julie/0000-0001-8265-972X","Canadian Institutes of Health Research [MOP-114985, MOP-119579]; Canadian Cancer Society; Hospital for Sick Children; Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); CIHR Strategic Training Program in Protein Folding and Interaction Dynamics; Summer Research Program at the Hospital for Sick Children","We thank R.

For example, the canonical molecular signals used to initiate protein synthesis in bacteria and eukaryotes are mutually exclusive(1). However, the core structures and conformational dynamics of ribosomes that are responsible for the translation steps that take place after initiation are ancient and conserved across the domains of life(2). We wanted to explore whether an undiscovered RNA-based signal might be able to use these conserved features, bypassing mechanisms specific to each domain of life, and initiate protein synthesis in both bacteria and eukaryotes. Although structured internal ribosome entry site (IRES) RNAs can manipulate ribosomes to initiate translation in eukaryotic cells, an analogous RNA structure-based mechanism has not been observed in bacteria. Here we report our discovery that a eukaryotic viral IRES can initiate translation in live bacteria. We solved the crystal structure of this IRES bound to a bacterial ribosome to 3.8 angstrom resolution, revealing that despite differences between bacterial and eukaryotic ribosomes this IRES binds directly to both and occupies the space normally used by transfer RNAs. Initiation in both bacteria and eukaryotes depends on the structure of the IRES RNA, but in bacteria this RNA uses a different mechanism that includes a form of ribosome repositioning after initial recruitment. This IRES RNA bridges billions of years of evolutionary divergence and provides an example of an RNA structure-based translation initiation signal capable of operating in two domains of life.","[Colussi, Timothy M.; Costantino, David A.; Jaafar, Zane A.; Plank, Terra-Dawn M.; Kieft, Jeffrey S.] Univ Colorado Denver, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Genet, Aurora, CO 80045 USA; [Colussi, Timothy M.; Costantino, David A.; Kieft, Jeffrey S.] Univ Colorado Denver, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Aurora, CO 80045 USA; [Zhu, Jianyu; Donohue, John Paul; Korostelev, Andrei A.; Noller, Harry F.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ctr Mol Biol RNA, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Zhu, Jianyu; Donohue, John Paul; Korostelev, Andrei A.; Noller, Harry F.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Mol Cell & Dev Biol, Sinsheimer Labs, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA","Kieft, JS (reprint author), Univ Colorado Denver, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Genet, Aurora, CO 80045 USA.",jeffrey.kieft@ucdenver.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health (NIH) [GM-17129, GM-59140]; National Science Foundation [MCB-723300]; NIH [GM-103105, GM-97333, GM-81346]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; American Heart Association [10PRE260143]","We thank the members of the Kieft laboratory for insight and discussion and the staff at the Advanced Photon Source for their support.

Mutations in different actin isoforms lead to early-onset autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing loss(1), familial thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections(2), and multiple variations of myopathies(3). In striated muscle fibres, the binding of myosin motors to actin filaments is mainly regulated by tropomyosin and troponin(4,5). Tropomyosin also binds to F-actin in smooth muscle and in non-muscle cells and stabilizes and regulates the filaments there in the absence of troponin(6). Although crystal structures for monomeric actin (G-actin) are available(7), a high-resolution structure of F-actin is still missing, hampering our understanding of how disease-causing mutations affect the function of thin muscle filaments and microfilaments. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of F-actin at a resolution of 3.7 angstrom in complex with tropomyo sin at a resolution of 6.5 angstrom, determined by electron cryomicroscopy. The structure reveals that the D-loop is ordered and acts as a central region for hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions that stabilize the F-actin filament. We clearly identify map density corresponding to ADP and Mg2+ and explain the possible effect of prominent disease-causing mutants. A comparison of F-actin with G-actin reveals the conformational changes during filament formation and identifies the D-loop as their key mediator. We also confirm that negatively charged tropomyosin interacts with a positively charged groove on F-actin. Comparison of the position of tropomyosin in F-actin-tropomyosin with its position in our previously determined F-actin-tropomyosin-myosin structure(8) reveals a myosin-induced transition of tropomyosin. Our results allow us to understand the role of individual mutations in the genesis of actin- and tropomyosin-related diseases and will serve as a strong foundation for the targeted development of drugs.","[von der Ecken, Julian; Raunser, Stefan] Max Planck Inst Mol Physiol, Dept Struct Biochem, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany; [Mueller, Mirco; Manstein, Dietmar J.] Hannover Med Sch, Inst Biophys Chem, D-30625 Hannover, Germany; [Lehman, William] Boston Univ, Sch Med, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Boston, MA 02118 USA; [Penczek, Pawel A.] Univ Texas Houston, Houston Med Sch, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Raunser, S (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Mol Physiol, Dept Struct Biochem, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany.",stefan.raunser@mpi-dortmund.mpg.de,,"Raunser, Stefan/0000-0001-9373-3016","Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek [175.010.2009.001]; European Union's Regional Development Fund through 'Kansen voor West' [21Z.014]; Behrens-Weise foundation; NIH [U54 094598, R01 60635]; DFG [MA1081/19-1, R37HL036153]","We thank O.

Variation occurs non-randomly across the genome, and mechanisms for this remain to be defined. Here we report that the 5' ends of Okazaki fragments have significantly increased levels of nucleotide substitution, indicating a replicative origin for such mutations. Using a novel method, emRiboSeq, we map the genome-wide contribution of polymerases, and show that despite Okazaki fragment processing, DNA synthesized by error-prone polymerase-alpha (Pol-alpha) is retained in vivo, comprising approximately 1.5% of the mature genome. We propose that DNA-binding proteins that rapidly re-associate post-replication act as partial barriers to Pol-delta-mediated displacement of Pol-alpha-synthesized DNA, resulting in incorporation of such Pol-a tracts and increased mutation rates at specific sites. We observe a mutational cost to chromatin and regulatory protein binding, resulting in mutation hotspots at regulatory elements, with signatures of this process detectable in both yeast and humans.","[Reijns, Martin A.

The RAG1-RAG2 protein complex initiates this site-specific recombination by cutting DNA at specific sites flanking the coding segments. Here we report the crystal structure of the mouse RAG1-RAG2 complex at 3.2A resolution. The 230-kilodalton RAG1-RAG2 heterotetramer is 'Y-shaped', with the amino-terminal domains of the two RAG1 chains forming an intertwined stalk. Each RAG1-RAG2 heterodimer composes one arm of the 'Y', with the active site in the middle and RAG2 at its tip. The RAG1-RAG2 structure rationalizes more than 60 mutations identified in immunodeficient patients, as well as a large body of genetic and biochemical data. The architectural similarity between RAG1 and the hairpin-forming transposases Hermes and Tn5 suggests the evolutionary conservation of these DNA rearrangements.","[Kim, Min-Sung; Lapkouski, Mikalai; Yang, Wei; Gellert, Martin] NIDDK, Mol Biol Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Yang, W (reprint author), NIDDK, Mol Biol Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",wei.yang@nih.gov; gellert@helix.nih.gov,"Yang, Wei/D-4926-2011","Yang, Wei/0000-0002-3591-2195","National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health","We thank G.

Each quasar contains a black hole with a mass of about one billion solar masses (10(9) M-circle dot)(2,6,7,9-13). The existence of such black holes when the Universe was less than one billion years old presents substantial challenges to theories of the formation and growth of black holes and the coevolution of black holes and galaxies(14). Here we report the discovery of an ultraluminous quasar, SDSS J010013.02+280225.8, at redshift z = 6.30. It has an optical and near-infrared luminosity a few times greater than those of previously known z > 6 quasars. On the basis of the deep absorption trough(15) on the blue side of the Lyman-alpha emission line in the spectrum, we estimate the proper size of the ionized proximity zone associated with the quasar to be about 26 million light years, larger than found with other z > 6.1 quasars with lower luminosities(16). We estimate (on the basis of a near-infrared spectrum) that the black hole has a mass of similar to 1.2 x 10(10) M-circle dot, which is consistent with the 1.3 x 10(10) M-circle dot derived by assuming an Eddington-limited accretion rate.","[Wu, Xue-Bing; Wang, Feige; Yang, Jinyi; Yang, Qian] Peking Univ, Sch Phys, Dept Astron, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Wu, Xue-Bing; Wang, Feige; Fan, Xiaohui; Jiang, Linhua; Wang, Ran; Yang, Jinyi; Yang, Qian] Peking Univ, Kavli Inst Astron & Astrophys, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Fan, Xiaohui; McGreer, Ian D.] Univ Arizona, Steward Observ, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Yi, Weimin] Chinese Acad Sci, Yunnan Observ, Kunming 650011, Peoples R China; [Yi, Weimin] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Yi, Weimin] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Struct & Evolut Celestial Objects, Kunming 650011, Peoples R China; [Zuo, Wenwen] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Astron Observ, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China; [Bian, Fuyan] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Astron & Astrophys, Mt Stromlo Observ, Weston, ACT 2611, Australia; [Thompson, David] Univ Arizona, Large Binocular Telescope Observ, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Beletsky, Yuri] Carnegie Inst Sci, Las Campanas Observ, La Serena, Chile","Wu, XB (reprint author), Peking Univ, Sch Phys, Dept Astron, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",wuxb@pku.edu.cn,"Jiang, Linhua/H-5485-2016","Jiang, Linhua/0000-0003-4176-6486; , Feige/0000-0002-7633-431X","NSFC [11033001, 11373008, 11443002]; Strategic Priority Research Program 'The Emergence of Cosmological Structures' of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB09000000]; National Key Basic Research Program of China [2014CB845700]; US NSF [AST 08-06861, AST 11-07682]; Chinese Academy of Sciences; People's Government of Yunnan Province; Strategic Priority Research Program 'The Emergence of Cosmological Structures' [XDB09000000]; National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Special Fund for Astronomy from the Ministry of Finance of China","X.-B.W. thanks the NSFC (grant nos 11033001 and 11373008), the Strategic Priority Research Program 'The Emergence of Cosmological Structures' of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (grant no.

As well as being of fundamental interest, teleportation has been recognized as an important element in long-distance quantum communication', distributed quantum networks' and measurementbased quantum computation. There have been numerous demonstrations of teleportation in different physical systems such as photons's, atoms', ionsio,H, electrons' and superconducting circuits'3. All the previous experiments were limited to the teleportation of one degree of freedom only. However, a single quantum particle can naturally possess various degrees of freedom internal and external and with coherent coupling among them. A fundamental open challenge is to teleport multiple degrees of freedom simultaneously, which is necessary to describe a quantum particle fully and, therefore, to teleport it intact. Here we demonstrate quantum teleportation of the composite quantum states of a single photon encoded in both spin and orbital angular momentum. We use photon pairs entangled in both degrees of freedom (that is, hyper-entangled) as the quantum channel for teleportation, and develop a method to project and discriminate hyper-entangled Bell states by exploiting probabilistic quantum non-demolition measurement, which can be extended to more degrees of freedom. We verify the teleportation for both spin-orbit product states and hybrid entangled states, and achieve a teleportation fidelity ranging from 0.57 to 0.68, above the classical limit. Our work is a step towards the teleportation of more complex quantum systems, and demonstrates an increase in our technical control of scalable quantum technologies.","[Wang, Xi-Lin; Cai, Xin-Dong; Su, Zu-En; Chen, Ming-Cheng; Wu, Dian; Li, Li; Liu, Nai-Le; Lu, Chao-Yang; Pan, Jian-Wei] Univ Sci & Technol China, Hefei Natl Lab Phys Sci Microscale, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xi-Lin; Cai, Xin-Dong; Su, Zu-En; Chen, Ming-Cheng; Wu, Dian; Li, Li; Liu, Nai-Le; Lu, Chao-Yang; Pan, Jian-Wei] Univ Sci & Technol China, Dept Modern Phys, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xi-Lin; Cai, Xin-Dong; Su, Zu-En; Chen, Ming-Cheng; Wu, Dian; Li, Li; Liu, Nai-Le; Lu, Chao-Yang; Pan, Jian-Wei] Univ Sci & Technol China, CAS Ctr Excellence, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xi-Lin; Cai, Xin-Dong; Su, Zu-En; Chen, Ming-Cheng; Wu, Dian; Li, Li; Liu, Nai-Le; Lu, Chao-Yang; Pan, Jian-Wei] Univ Sci & Technol China, Synerget Innovat Ctr Quantum Informat & Quantum P, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China","Lu, CY (reprint author), Univ Sci & Technol China, Hefei Natl Lab Phys Sci Microscale, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China.",cylu@ustc.edu.cn; pan@ustc.edu.cn,"Lu, Chao-Yang/D-8481-2011; Wang, Xi-Lin/E-2562-2011; Pan, Jian-Wei/A-2332-2010","Lu, Chao-Yang/0000-0002-8227-9177; Pan, Jian-Wei/0000-0002-6100-5142",National Natural Science Foundation of China; Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Fundamental Research Program [2011CB921300],"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the National Fundamental Research Program (grant no. 2011CB921300).",,30,115,123,18,181,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,26-Feb,2015,518,7540,,,,,516,519,,10.1038/nature14246,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,CC1JP,WOS:000350097300042,25719668,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Consequently, emulsions are central components of medicine, food and performance materials. Complex emulsions, including Janus droplets (that is, droplets with faces of differing chemistries) and multiple emulsions, are of increasing importance' in pharmaceuticals and medical diagnostics', in the fabrication of microparticles and capsules' for food', in chemical separations', in cosmetics', and in dynamic optics'. Because complex emulsion properties and functions are related to the droplet geometry and composition, the development of rapid, simple fabrication approaches allowing precise control over the droplets' physical and chemical characteristics is critical. Significant advances in the fabrication of complex emulsions have been made using a number of procedures, ranging from largescale, less precise techniques that give compositional heterogeneity using high-shear mixers and membranes'', to small-volume but more precise microfluidic methodsn'''. However, such approaches have yet to create droplet morphologies that can be controllably altered after emulsification. Reconfigurable complex liquids potentially have great utility as dynamically tunable materials. Here we describe an approach to the one-step fabrication of three- and four-phase complex emulsions with highly controllable and reconfigurable morphologies. The fabrication makes use of the temperature-sensitive miscibility of hydrocarbon, silicone and fluorocarbon liquids, and is applied to both the microfluidic and the scalable batch production of complex droplets. We demonstrate that droplet geometries can be alternated between encapsulated and Janus configurations by varying the interfacial tensions using hydrocarbon and fluorinated surfactants including stimuli-responsive and cleavable surfactants. This yields a generalizable strategy for the fabrication of multiphase emulsions with controllably reconfigurable morphologies and the potential to create a wide range of responsive materials.","[Zarzar, Lauren D.; Sletten, Ellen M.; Kalow, Julia A.; Swager, Timothy M.] MIT, Dept Chem, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Zarzar, Lauren D.; Sletten, Ellen M.; Kalow, Julia A.; Swager, Timothy M.] MIT, Inst Soldier Nanotechnol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Sresht, Vishnu; Blankschtein, Daniel] MIT, Dept Chem Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Blankschtein, D (reprint author), MIT, Dept Chem Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",dblank@mit.edu; tswager@mit.edu,"Kalow, Julia/C-7353-2016","Kalow, Julia/0000-0001-9215-520X; /0000-0002-5764-9383","Eni S.p.A. under Eni-MIT Alliance Solar Frontiers Program; US Army Research Laboratory; US Army Research Office through Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies [W911NF-13-D-0001]; F32 Ruth L.

Clouds of ice crystals (CO2 ice or H2O ice) have been observed numerous times by spacecraft and ground-based telescopes, showing that clouds are typically layered and always confined below an altitude of 100 kilometres; suspended dust has also been detected at altitudes up to 60 kilometres during major dust storms -6. Highly concentrated and localized patches of auroral emission controlled by magnetic field anomalies in the crust have been observed at an altitude of 130 kilometres'. Here we report the occurrence in March and April 2012 of two bright, extremely high-altitude plumes at the Martian terminator (the day-night boundary) at 200 to 250 kilometres or more above the surface, and thus well into the ionosphere and the exosphere'''. They were spotted at a longitude of about 1950 west, a latitude of about 45 (at Terra Cimmeria), extended about 500 to 1,000 kilometres in both the north-south and east-west directions, and lasted for about 10 days. The features exhibited day-to-day variability, and were seen at the morning terminator but not at the evening limb, which indicates rapid evolution in less than 10 hours and a cyclic behaviour. We used photometric measurements to explore two possible scenarios and investigate their nature. For particles reflecting solar radiation, clouds of CO2-ice or H2O-ice particles with an effective radius of 0.1 micrometres are favoured over dust. Alternatively, the plume could arise from auroral emission, of a brightness more than 1,000 times that of the Earth's aurora, over a region with a strong magnetic anomaly where aurorae have previously been detected'. Importantly, both explanations defy our current understanding of Mars' upper atmosphere.","[Sanchez-Lavega, A.; Garcia-Melendo, E.; Perez-Hoyos, S.] Univ Basque Country, ETS Ingn, Dept Fis Aplicada 1, Bilbao 48013, Spain; [Sanchez-Lavega, A.; Perez-Hoyos, S.; Lopez-Valverde, M.

To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory processing systems4'5, the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopaminergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms'. While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains"", their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks'"" to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent on the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games"". We demonstrate that the deep Q-network agent, receiving only the pixels and the game score as inputs, was able to surpass the performance of all previous algorithms and achieve a level comparable to that of a professional human games tester across a set of 49 games, using the same algorithm, network architecture and hyperparameters. This work bridges the divide between high-dimensional sensory inputs and actions, resulting in the first artificial agent that is capable of learning to excel at a diverse array of challenging tasks.","[Mnih, Volodymyr; Kavukcuoglu, Koray; Silver, David; Rusu, Andrei A.; Veness, Joel; Bellemare, Marc G.; Graves, Alex; Riedmiller, Martin; Fidjeland, Andreas K.; Ostrovski, Georg; Petersen, Stig; Beattie, Charles; Sadik, Amir; Antonoglou, Ioannis; King, Helen; Kumaran, Dharshan; Wierstra, Daan; Legg, Shane; Hassabis, Demis] Google DeepMind, London EC4A 3TW, England","Kavukcuoglu, K (reprint author), Google DeepMind, 5 New St Sq, London EC4A 3TW, England.",demishassabis@google.com,,,,,,30,347,371,156,480,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,26-Feb,2015,518,7540,,,,,529,533,,10.1038/nature14236,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,CC1JP,WOS:000350097300045,25719670,No,Y,N,11/20/17

In the first vertebrates, this skeleton probably consisted of collagenous cellular cartilage, which forms the embryonic skeleton of all vertebrates and the adult skeleton of modern jawless and cartilaginous fish. In the head, most cellular cartilage is derived from a migratory cell population called the neural crest, which arises from the edges of the central nervous system. Because collagenous cellular cartilage and neural crest cells have not been described in invertebrates', the appearance of cellular cartilage derived from neural crest cells is considered a turning point in vertebrate evolution'. Here we show that a tissue with many of the defining features of vertebrate cellular cartilage transiently forms in the larvae of the invertebrate chordate Branchiostoma floridae (Florida amphioxus). We also present evidence that during evolution, a key regulator of vertebrate cartilage development, SoxE, gained new cis-regulatory sequences that subsequently directed its novel expression in neural crest cells. Together, these results suggest that the origin of the vertebrate head skeleton did not depend on the evolution of a new skeletal tissue, as is commonly thought, but on the spread of this tissue throughout the head. We further propose that the evolution of cis-regulatory elements near an ancient regulator of cartilage differentiation was a major factor in the evolution of the vertebrate head skeleton.","[Jandzik, David; Garnett, Aaron T.; Square, Tyler A.; Cattell, Maria V.; Medeiros, Daniel M.] Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Jandzik, David] Comenius Univ, Dept Zool, Bratislava 84215, Slovakia; [Yu, Jr-Kai] Acad Sinica, Inst Cellular & Organism Biol, Taipei 11529, Taiwan","Medeiros, DM (reprint author), Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",Daniel.Medeiros@Colorado.edu,"jandzik, david/N-7985-2016","jandzik, david/0000-0002-4239-0014; MEDEIROS, DANIEL/0000-0002-8182-6028","National Science Foundation [IOS 1257040, IOS 1160733, DBI 0905991]; University of Colorado, Boulder start-up funds; National Science Council Taiwan [NSC101-2923-B-001-004-MY2, NSC102-2311-B-001-011-MY3]; Academia Sinica Taiwan [AS-98-CDA-L06]","We thank D.

However, a paucity of experimental studies has meant that there is no comparable understanding of the process by which socially transmitted behaviours might spread and persist in animal populations'''. Here we show experimental evidence of the establishment of foraging traditions in a wild bird population. We introduced alternative novel foraging techniques into replicated wild sub-populations of great tits (Parus major) and used automated tracking to map the diffusion, establishment and long-term persistence of the seeded innovations. Furthermore, we used social network analysis to examine the social factors that influenced diffusion dynamics. From only two trained birds in each sub-population, the information spread rapidly through social network ties, to reach an average of 75% of individuals, with a total of 414 knowledgeable individuals performing 57,909 solutions over all replicates. The sub-populations were heavily biased towards using the technique that was originally introduced, resulting in established local traditions that were stable over two generations, despite a high population turnover. Finally, we demonstrate a strong effect of social conformity, with individuals disproportionately adopting the most frequent local variant when first acquiring an innovation, and continuing to favour social information over personal information. Cultural conformity is thought to be a key factor in the evolution of complex culture in humans''. In providing the first experimental demonstration of conformity in a wild non-primate, and of cultural norms in foraging techniques in any wild animal, our results suggest a much broader taxonomic occurrence of such an apparently complex cultural behaviour.","[Aplin, Lucy M.; Farine, Damien R.; Sheldon, Ben C.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Edward Grey Inst, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Aplin, Lucy M.; Cockburn, Andrew] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Biol, Dept Evolut Ecol & Genet, Canberra, ACT 2600, Australia; [Farine, Damien R.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Anthropol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Farine, Damien R.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Ancon 9100, Panama; [Morand-Ferron, Julie] Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON K1N 9B2, Canada; [Thornton, Alex] Univ Exeter, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Dept Biosci, Penryn TR10 9EZ, England; [Sheldon, Ben C.] Uppsala Univ, Dept Ecol & Genet, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden","Aplin, LM (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Edward Grey Inst, Oxford OX1 3PS, England.",lucy.aplin@zoo.ox.ac.uk,"Sheldon, Ben/A-8056-2010; Cockburn, Andrew/A-4864-2008","Sheldon, Ben/0000-0002-5240-7828; Farine, Damien/0000-0003-2208-7613; Morand-Ferron, Julie/0000-0001-5186-7710","BBSRC [BB/L006081/1, BB/H021817/1]; ERC [AdG 250164]; Australian Postgraduate Award","This project was supported by grants from the BBSRC (BB/L006081/1) and the ERC (AdG 250164) to B.C.S., who was also supported by a visiting professorship at Uppsala University.

Single HSCs can rebuild the system after transplantation(1-5). Chromosomal marking', viral integration(7-9) and barcoding' of transplanted HSCs suggest that very low numbers of HSCs perpetuate a continuous stream of differentiating cells. However, the numbers of productive HSCs during normal haematopoiesis, and the flux of differentiating progeny remain unknown. Here we devise a mouse model allowing inducible genetic labelling of the most primitive Tie(2+) HSCs in bone marrow, and quantify label progression along haematopoietic development by limiting dilution analysis and data-driven modelling. During maintenance of the haematopoietic system, at least 30% or 5,000 HSCs are productive in the adult mouse after label induction. However, the time to approach equilibrium between labelled HSCs and their progeny is surprisingly long, a time scale that would exceed the mouse's life. Indeed, we find that adult haematopoiesis is largely 'sustained by previously designated 'short-term' stem cells downstream of HSCs that nearly fully self-renew, and receive rare but polydonal HSC input. By contrast, in fetal and early postnatal life, HSCs are rapidly used to establish the immune and blood system. In the adult mouse, 5-fluoruracil-induced leukopenia enhances the output of HSCs and of downstream compartments, thus accelerating haematopoietic flux. Label tracing also identifies a strong lineage bias in adult mice, with several-hundred-fold larger myeloid than lymphoid output, which is only marginally accentuated with age. Finally, we show that transplantation imposes severe constraints on HSC engraftment, consistent with the previously observed oligodonal HSC activity under these conditions. Thus, we uncover fundamental differences between the normal maintenance of the haematopoietic system, its regulation by challenge, and its re-establishment after transplantation. HSC fate mapping and its linked modelling provide a quantitative framework for studying in situ the regulation of haematopoiesis in health and disease.","[Busch, Katrin; Klapproth, Kay; Rodewald, Hans-Reimer] German Canc Res Ctr, Div Cellular Immunol, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Barile, Melania; Flossdorf, Michael; Hoefer, Thomas] German Canc Res Ctr, Div Theoret Syst Biol, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Holland-Letz, Tim] German Canc Res Ctr, Div Biostat, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Schlenner, Susan M.] Univ Leuven, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Schlenner, Susan M.] VIB, Autoimmune Genet Lab, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Reth, Michael] Univ Freiburg, Ctr Biol Signaling Studies, BIOSS, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Reth, Michael] Univ Freiburg, Fac Biol, Dept Mol Immunol, D-79108 Freiburg, Germany; [Reth, Michael] Max Planck Inst Immunobiol & Epigenet, D-79108 Freiburg, Germany","Rodewald, HR (reprint author), German Canc Res Ctr, Div Cellular Immunol, Neuenheimer Feld 280, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.",thoefer@dkfz.de; hr.rodewald@dkfz.de,"Hofer, Thomas/G-5665-2013","Hofer, Thomas/0000-0003-3560-8780","International Graduate School in Molecular Medicine, Ulm; DFG [EXC294, TRR130, SFB746, SFB 873, SFB 938]; BMBF [Fkz 031614]; EU-FP7 Marie Curie ITN Quantitative T cell immunology (QuanTI); ERC [233074]; Helmholtz Alliance on preclinical cancer models (PCCC)","We thank C.

Progenitors with macrophage potential in vitro have been described in the yolk sac before emergence of HSCO8-3, and fetal macrophages(13-15) can develop independently of Myb(4), a transcription factor required for HSC16, and can persist in adult tissues(4.17,18). Nevertheless, the origin of adult macrophages and the qualitative and quantitative contributions of HSC and putative non-HSC-derived progenitors are still unclear'. Here we show in mice that the vast majority of adult tissue-resident macrophages in liver (Kupffer cells), brain '(microglia), epidermis (Langerhans cells) and lung (alveolar macrophages) originate from a Tie2(+) (also known as Tek) cellular pathway generating Csf1r(+) erythro-myeloid progenitors (EMPs) distinct from HSCs. EMPs develop in the yolk sac at embryonic day (E) 8.5, migrate and colonize the nascent fetal liver before E10.5, and give rise to fetal erythrocytes, macrophages, granulocytes and monocytes until at least E16.5. Subsequently, HSC-derived cells replace erythrocytes, granulocytes and monocytes. Kupffer cells, microglia and Langerhans cells are only marginally replaced in oneyear-old mice, whereas alveolar macrophages may be progressively replaced in ageing mice. Our fate-mapping experiments identify, in the fetal liver, a sequence of yolk sac EMP-derived and HSC-derived haematopoiesis, and identify yolk sac EMPs as a common origin for tissue macrophages.","[Perdiguero, Elisa Gomez; Schulz, Christian; Crozet, Lucile; Garner, Hannah; Trouillet, Celine; Geissmann, Frederic] Kings Coll London, CMCBI, London SE1 1UL, England; [Klapproth, Kay; Busch, Katrin; Rodewald, Hans-Reimer] German Canc Res Ctr, Div Cellular Immunol, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Azzoni, Emanuele; de Bruijn, Marella F.] Univ Oxford, John Radcliffe Hosp, Weatherall Inst Mol Med, MRC,Mol Haematol Unit, Oxford OX3 9DS, England","Geissmann, F (reprint author), Kings Coll London, CMCBI, London SE1 1UL, England.",frederic.geissmann@kcl.ac.uk,,"geissmann, frederic/0000-0001-5029-2468; Gomez Perdiguero, Elisa/0000-0002-7717-7897; Azzoni, Emanuele/0000-0002-4572-5692","Wellcome Trust [WT101853MA]; ERC from European Research Council [2010-StG-261299]; ERC [233074, SFB 938, SFB 873]","The authors are indebted to J.

There are several features that distinguish t-AML from de novo AMI, induding a higher incidence of TP53 mutations(3,3) abnormalities of chromosomes 5 or 7, complex cytogenetics and a reduced response to chemotherapy'. However, it is not clear how prior exposure to cytotoxic therapy influences leukaemogenesis. In particular, the mechanism by which TP53 mutations are selectively enriched in t-ANIL/t-MDS is unknown. Here, by sequencing the genomes of 22 patients with t-AML, we show that the total number of somatic single-nucleotide variants and the percentage of chemotherapy-related transversions are similar in t-AML and de novo AML, indicating that previous chemotherapy does not induce genome-wide DNA damage. We identified four cases of t-ANIL/ t-MDS in which the exact TP53 mutation found at diagnosis was also present at low frequencies (0.003-0.7%) in mobilized blood leukocytes or bone marrow 1-6 years before the development of t-AML/tMDS, including two cases in which the relevant TP53 mutation was detected before any chemotherapy. Moreover, functional TP53 mutations were identified in small populations of peripheral blood cells of healthy chemotherapy-naive elderly individuals. Finally, in mouse bone marrow chimaeras containing both wild-type and Tp53(+/-) haematopoietic stein/progenitor cells (HSPCs), the Tp53(+/-) HSPCs preferentially expanded after exposure to chemotherapy. These data suggest that cytotoxic therapy does not directly induce TP53 mutations. Rather, they support a model in which rare HSPCs carrying age-related TP53 mutations are resistant to chemotherapy and expand preferentially after treatment. The early acquisition of TP53 mutations in the founding HSPC clone probably contributes to the frequent cytogenetic abnormalities and poor responses to chemotherapy that are typical of patients with t-AML/t-MDS.","[Wong, Terrence N.; Touma, Waseem; Welch, John S.; Lamprecht, Tamara L.; Heath, Sharon; Ding, Li; Westervelt, Peter; DiPersio, John F.; Walter, Matthew J.; Graubert, Timothy A.; Ley, Timothy J.; Link, Daniel C.] Washington Univ, Dept Med, Div Oncol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Ramsingh, Giridharan] Univ So Calif, Dept Med, Jane Anne Nohl Div Hematol, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Young, Andrew L.; Druley, Todd E.] Washington Univ, Dept Pediat, Div Hematol Oncol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Miller, Christopher A.; Hundal, Jasreet; Fulton, Robert S.; Mardis, Elaine R.; Wilson, Richard K.] Washington Univ, Genome Inst, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Welch, John S.; Ding, Li; Mardis, Elaine R.; Westervelt, Peter; DiPersio, John F.; Walter, Matthew J.; Graubert, Timothy A.; Ley, Timothy J.; Link, Daniel C.; Wilson, Richard K.] Washington Univ, Siteman Canc Ctr, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Shen, Dong] AstraZeneca, Gaithersburg, MD 20878 USA; [Baty, Jack D.] Washington Univ, Div Biostat, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Klco, Jeffery M.] Washington Univ, Dept Pathol & Immunol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Mardis, Elaine R.; Wilson, Richard K.] Washington Univ, Dept Genet, St Louis, MO 63110 USA","Link, DC (reprint author), Washington Univ, Dept Med, Div Oncol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.",dlink@dom.wustl.edu,,"Ramsingh, Giridharan/0000-0003-0706-3584; Touma, Waseem/0000-0002-3273-432X; Klco, Jeffery/0000-0003-2961-6960; Graubert, Timothy/0000-0002-7710-1171","National Institutes of Health [PO1 CA101937, U54 HG003079]; Leukemia & Lymphoma Society","We thank A.

However, how ubiquitom expression of housekeeping genes is achieved has been less dear. In particular, it is unknown whether ubiquitously active enhancers exist and how developmental and housekeeping gene regulation is separated. An attractive hypothesis is that different core promoters might exhibit an intrinsic specificity to certain enhancers'. This is conceivable, as various core promoter sequence elements are differentially distributed between genes of different functions', including elements that are predominantly found at either developmentally regulated or at housekeeping genes(2-6). Here we show that thousands of enhancers in Drosophila melanogaster S2 and ovarian somatic cells (OSCs) exhibit a marked specificity to one of two core promoters one derived from a ubiquitously expressed ribosomal protein gene and another from a developmentally regulated transcription factor and confirm the existence of these two classes for five additional core promoters from genes with diverse functions. Housekeeping enhancers are active across the two cell types, while developmental enhancers exhibit strong cell-type specificity. Both enhancer classes differ in their genomic distribution, the functions of neighbouring genes, and the core promoter elements of these neighbouring genes. In addition, we identify two transcription factots Dref and Tr that bind and activate housekeeping versus developmental enhancers, respectively. Our results provide evidence for a sequence-encoded enhancer-core-promoter specificity that separates developmental and housekeeping gene regulatory programs for thousands of enhancers and their target genes across the entire genome.","[Zabidi, Muhammad A.; Arnold, Cosmas D.; Schernhuber, Katharina; Pagani, Michaela; Rath, Martina; Frank, Olga; Stark, Alexander] Vienna Bioctr VBC, Res Inst Mol Pathol IMP, A-1030 Vienna, Austria","Stark, A (reprint author), Vienna Bioctr VBC, Res Inst Mol Pathol IMP, Dr Bohr Gasse 7, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",stark@starklab.org,"Stark, Alexander/D-1473-2012","Stark, Alexander/0000-0003-2611-0841",Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [F4303-B09]; European Research Council [242922]; Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH,"We thank L.

However, RBMs can be buried within their local RNA structures'', thus inhibiting RNA-protein interactions. N-6-methyladenosine (m(6)A), the most abundant and dynamic internal modification in eulcaryotic messenger RNA(8-19), can be selectively recognized by the YTHDF2 protein to affect the stability of cytoplasmic mRNAs(15), but how m(6)A achieves its wide-ranging physiological role needs further exploration. Here we show in human cells that m(6)A controls the RNA-structuredependent accessibility of RBMs to affect RNA-protein interactions for biological regulation; we term this mechanism 'the m6A-switch'. We found that m(6)A alters the local structure in mRNA and long non-coding RNA (IncRNA) to facilitate binding of heterogeneous nuclear ribonudeoprotein C (HNRNPC), an abundant nuclear RNAbinding protein responsible for pre-mRNA processing'. Combining photoactivatable-ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) and anti-m(6)A immunoprecipitation (MeRIP) approaches enabled us to identify 39,060 m(6)A-switches among HNRNPC-binding sites; and global m(6)A reduction decreased HNRNPC binding at 2,798 high-confidence m(6)A-switches. We determined that these m(6)A-switch-regulated HNRNPC-binding activities affect the abundance as well as alternative splicing of target mRNAs, demonstrating the regulatory role of m(6)A-switches on gene expression and RNA maturation. Our results illustrate how RNA-binding proteins gain regulated access to their RBMs through m6A-dependent RNA structural remodelling, and provide a new direction for investigating RNA-modification-coded cellular biology.","[Liu, Nian; Dai, Qing; He, Chuan] Univ Chicago, Dept Chem, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Zheng, Guanqun; He, Chuan; Parisien, Marc; Pan, Tao] Univ Chicago, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [He, Chuan; Pan, Tao] Univ Chicago, Inst Biophys Dynam, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [He, Chuan] Univ Chicago, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Parisien, M (reprint author), McGill Univ, Fac Dent, Montreal, PQ H3A 0G1, Canada.",marc.parisien@mcgill.ca; taopan@uchicago.edu,,"Parisien, Marc/0000-0003-2924-5960",National Institutes of Health EUREKA [GM088599];  [K01HG006699],"This work is supported by National Institutes of Health EUREKA GM088599 (C.H. and T.P.), and by K01HG006699 (Q.D.).

Notch signalling, particularly through the Notch effector HES5, is a major pathway critical for the onset and maintenance of neural progenitor cells in the embryonic and adult nervous system(1-3). Here we report the transcriptional and epigenomic analysis of six consecutive neural progenitor cell stages derived from a HES5::eGFPreporter human embryonic stem cell line(4). Using this system, we aimed to model cell-fate decisions including specification, expansion and patterning during the ontogeny of cortical neural stem and progenitor cells. In order to dissect regulatory mechanisms that orchestrate the stage-specific differentiation process, we developed a computational framework to infer key regulators of each cell-state transition based on the progressive remodelling of the epigenetic landscape and then validated these through a pooled short hairpin RNA screen. We were also able to refine our previous observations on epigenetic priming at transcription factor binding sites and suggest here that they are mediated by combinations of core and stage-specific factors. Taken together, we demonstrate the utility of our system and outline a general framework, not limited to the context of the neural lineage, to dissect regulatory circuits of differentiation.","[Ziller, Michael J.; Donaghey, Julie; Pop, Ramona; Mallard, William; Issner, Robbyn; Gifford, Casey A.; Goren, Alon; Xing, Jeffrey; Gu, Hongcang; Cacchiarelli, Davide; Tsankov, Alexander M.; Epstein, Charles; Rinn, John L.; Mikkelsen, Tarjei S.; Gnirke, Andreas; Bernstein, Bradley E.; Meissner, Alexander] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Ziller, Michael J.; Donaghey, Julie; Pop, Ramona; Gifford, Casey A.; Tsankov, Alexander M.; Rinn, John L.; Meissner, Alexander] Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Ziller, Michael J.; Donaghey, Julie; Pop, Ramona; Mallard, William; Gifford, Casey A.; Tsankov, Alexander M.; Rinn, John L.; Meissner, Alexander] Harvard Univ, Dept Stem Cell & Regenerat Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Edri, Reuven; Yaffe, Yakey; Elkabetz, Yechiel] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Sackler Sch Med, IL-6997801 Ramat Aviv, Israel; [Goren, Alon; Bernstein, Bradley E.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Goren, Alon; Bernstein, Bradley E.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Goren, Alon; Bernstein, Bradley E.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Goren, Alon; Bernstein, Bradley E.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Canc Res, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Kohlbacher, Oliver] Univ Tubingen, Ctr Bioinformat, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Kohlbacher, Oliver] Univ Tubingen, Quantitat Biol Ctr, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany","Elkabetz, Y (reprint author), Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Sackler Sch Med, IL-6997801 Ramat Aviv, Israel.",elkabetz@tauex.tau.ac.il; alexander_meissner@harvard.edu,,"Goren, Alon/0000-0001-5669-9357","NIH [U01ES017155]; NHGRI [HG006911]; NIGMS [P01GM099117]; New York Stem Cell Foundation; Israel Science Foundation (ISF) [1126/10, 1710/10]; Marie Curie International Reintegration Grant [IRG277151]; Charles H.

It is well established that an upregulation of glial-derived chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans (CSPGs) within the glial scar and perineuronal net creates a barrier to axonal regrowth and sprouting(1-5). Protein tyrosine phosphatase sigma (PTP sigma), along with its sister phosphatase leukocyte common antigen-related (LAR) and the nogo receptors 1 and 3 (NgR), have recently been identified as receptors for the inhibitory glycosylated side chains of CSPGs(6-8). Here we find in rats that PTP sigma has a critical role in converting growth cones into a dystrophic state by tightly stabilizing them within CSPG-rich substrates. We generated a membrane-permeable peptide mimetic of the PTP sigma wedge domain that binds to PTP sigma and relieves CSPG-mediated inhibition. Systemic delivery of this peptide over weeks restored substantial serotonergic innervation to the spinal cord below the level of injury and facilitated functional recovery of both locomotor and urinary systems. Our results add a new layer of understanding to the critical role of PTP sigma in mediating the growth-inhibited state of neurons due to CSPGs within the injured adult spinal cord.","[Lang, Bradley T.; Cregg, Jared M.; DePaul, Marc A.; Tran, Amanda P.; Madalena, Kathryn M.; Busch, Sarah A.; Silver, Jerry] Case Western Reserve Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Xu, Kui; Shen, Yingjie] Ohio State Univ, Ctr Brain & Spinal Cord Repair, Dept Neurosci, Wexner Med Ctr, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Dyck, Scott M.; Karimi-Abdolrezaee, Soheila] Univ Manitoba, Regenerat Med Program, Winnipeg, MB R3E 0J9, Canada; [Dyck, Scott M.; Karimi-Abdolrezaee, Soheila] Univ Manitoba, Dept Physiol, Winnipeg, MB R3E 0J9, Canada; [Brown, Benjamin P.] Baldwin Wallace Univ, Berea, OH 44017 USA; [Weng, Yi-Lan] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Inst Cell Engn, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Li, Shuxin] Temple Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Neural Repair & Rehabil, Shriners Hosp Pediat Res Ctr, Philadelphia, PA 19140 USA","Silver, J (reprint author), Case Western Reserve Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",JXS10@case.edu,"DePaul, Marc/H-9010-2017","DePaul, Marc/0000-0002-3249-9550",National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke [NS025713]; Case Western Reserve University Council; Unite to Fight Paralysis; Brumagin Memorial Fund; Spinal Cord Injury Sucks; United Paralysis Foundation; Kaneko Family Fund,"This work was supported by National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke grant NS025713 (J.S.); the Case Western Reserve University Council to Advance Human Health; P.

It is caused by maternal deficiency of the imprinted gene UBE3A, encoding an E3 ubiquitin ligase(3-5). All patients carry at least one copy of paternal UBE3A, which is intact but silenced by a nuclear-localized long non-coding RNA, UBE3A antisense transcript (UBE3A-ATS)(6-8). Murine Ube3a-ATS reduction by either transcription termination or topoisomerase I inhibition has been shown to increase paternal Ube3a expression(9,10). Despite a clear understanding of the disease-causing event in Angelman syndrome and the potential to harness the intact paternal allele to correct the disease, no gene-specific treatment exists for patients. Here we developed a potential therapeutic intervention for Angelman syndrome by reducing Ube3a-ATS with antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). ASO treatment achieved specific reduction of Ube3a-ATS and sustained unsilencing of paternal Ube3a in neurons in vitro and in vivo. Partial restoration of UBE3A protein in an Angelman syndrome mouse model ameliorated some cognitive deficits associated with the disease. Although additional studies of phenotypic correction are needed, we have developed a sequence-specific and clinically feasible method to activate expression of the paternal Ube3a allele.","[Meng, Linyan; Beaudet, Arthur L.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Human Genet, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Meng, Linyan; Beaudet, Arthur L.] Texas Childrens Hosp, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Ward, Amanda J.; Chun, Seung; Bennett, C.

For example, most mammalian cells cannot proliferate without exogenous glutamine supplementation even though glutamine is a non-essential amino acid(1,2). Here we show that mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells grown under conditions that maintain naive pluripotency(3) are capable of proliferation in the absence of exogenous glutamine. Despite this, ES cells consume high levels of exogenous glutamine when the metabolite is available. In comparison to more differentiated cells, naive ES cells utilize both glucose and glutamine catabolism to maintain a high level of intracellular alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha KG). Consequently, naive ES cells exhibit an elevated alpha KG to succinate ratio that promotes histone/DNA demethylation and maintains pluripotency. Direct manipulation of the intracellular alpha KG/succinate ratio is sufficient to regulate multiple chromatin modifications, including H3K27me3 and ten-eleven translocation (Tet)-dependent DNA demethylation, which contribute to the regulation of pluripotency-associated gene expression. In vitro, supplementation with cell-permeable alpha KG directly supports ES-cell self-renewal while cell-permeable succinate promotes differentiation. This work reveals that intracellular alpha KG/succinate levels can contribute to the maintenance of cellular identity and have a mechanistic role in the transcriptional and epigenetic state of stem cells.","[Carey, Bryce W.; Allis, C.

The differentiation of T(H)17 cells is regulated by transcription factors such as ROR gamma t(3,4), but post-translational mechanisms preventing the rampant production of pro-inflammatory IL-17A have received less attention. Here we show that the deubiquitylating enzyme DUBA is a negative regulator of IL-17A production in T cells. Mice with DUBA-deficient T cells developed exacerbated inflammation in the small intestine after challenge with anti-CD3 antibodies. DUBA interacted with the ubiquitin ligase UBR5, which suppressed DUBA abundance in naive T cells. DUBA accumulated in activated T cells and stabilized UBR5, which then ubiquitylated ROR gamma t inresponse toTGF-beta signalling. Our data identify DUBA as a cell-intrinsic suppressor of IL-17 production.","[Rutz, Sascha; Eidenschenk, Celine; Noubade, Rajkumar; Wang, Xiaoting; Lesch, Justin; Lu, Rongze; DeVoss, Jason; Ouyang, Wenjun] Genentech Inc, Dept Immunol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Kayagaki, Nobuhiko; Newton, Kim; Dixit, Vishva M.] Genentech Inc, Dept Physiol Chem, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Phung, Qui T.; Vasser, Mark; Kirkpatrick, Donald S.; Lill, Jennie R.] Genentech Inc, Dept Prot Chem, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Huang, Oscar W.; Cochran, Andrea G.] Genentech Inc, Dept Early Discovery Biochem, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Fauber, Benjamin P.] Genentech Inc, Discovery Chem, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Webster, Joshua; Diehl, Lauri] Genentech Inc, Dept Pathol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Modrusan, Zora] Genentech Inc, Dept Mol Biol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA","Ouyang, WJ (reprint author), Genentech Inc, Dept Immunol, 1 DNA Way, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA.",ouyang@gene.com; dixit@gene.com,"Lu, Rongze/R-2149-2016","Cochran, Andrea/0000-0001-6469-795X; Ouyang, Wenjun/0000-0002-1811-5864; Kirkpatrick, Donald/0000-0003-3091-2804",,,,37,22,22,1,10,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,19-Feb,2015,518,7539,,,,,417,421,,10.1038/nature13979,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,CB3SA,WOS:000349547400046,25470037,No,,,11/20/17

Clones evolve dynamically in space and time following principles of Darwinian evolution(1,2), underpinning important emergent features such as drug resistance and metastasis(3-7). Human breast cancer xenoengraftment is used as a means of capturing and studying tumour biology, and breast tumour xenografts are generally assumed to be reasonable models of the originating tumours(8-10). However, the consequences and reproducibility of engraftment and propagation on the genomic clonal architecture of tumours have not been systematically examined at single-cell resolution. Here we show, using deep-genome and single-cell sequencing methods, the clonal dynamics of initial engraftment and subsequent serial propagation of primary and metastatic human breast cancers in immunodeficient mice. In all 15 cases examined, clonal selection on engraftment was observed in both primary and metastatic breast tumours, varying in degree from extreme selective engraftment of minor (<5% of starting population) clones to moderate, polyclonal engraftment. Furthermore, ongoing clonal dynamics during serial passaging is a feature of tumours experiencing modest initial selection. Through single-cell sequencing, we show that major mutation clusters estimated from tumour population sequencing relate predictably to the most abundant clonal genotypes, even in clonally complex and rapidly evolving cases. Finally, we show that similar clonal expansion patterns can emerge in independent grafts of the same starting tumour population, indicating that genomic aberrations can be reproducible determinants of evolutionary trajectories. Our results show that measurement of genomically defined clonal population dynamics will be highly informative for functional studies using patient-derived breast cancer xenoengraftment.","[Eirew, Peter; Steif, Adi; Khattra, Jaswinder; Ha, Gavin; Yap, Damian; Farahani, Hossein; Wan, Adrian; Laks, Emma; Biele, Justina; Shumansky, Karey; Rosner, Jamie; McPherson, Andrew; Nielsen, Cydney; Roth, Andrew J.

DNA also demonstrates the capacity to fold into three-dimensional structures and form catalysts in vitro(2). However, to what degree these natural biopolymers comprise functionally privileged chemical scaffolds(3) for folding or the evolution of catalysis is not known. The ability of synthetic genetic polymers (XNAs) with alternative backbone chemistries not found in nature to fold into defined structures and bind ligands(4) raises the possibility that these too might be capable of forming catalysts (XNAzymes). Here we report the discovery of such XNAzymes, elaborated in four different chemistries (arabino nucleic acids, ANA(5); 2'-fluoroarabino nucleic acids, FANA(6); hexitol nucleic acids, HNA; and cyclohexene nucleic acids, CeNA(7)) directly from random XNA oligomer pools, exhibiting in trans RNA endonuclease and ligase activities. We also describe an XNA-XNA ligase metalloenzyme in the FANA framework, establishing catalysis in an entirely synthetic system and enabling the synthesis of FANA oligomers and an active RNA endonuclease FANAzyme from its constituent parts. These results extend catalysis beyond biopolymers and establish technologies for the discovery of catalysts in a wide range of polymer scaffolds not found in nature(8). Evolution of catalysis independent of any natural polymer has implications for the definition of chemical boundary conditions for the emergence of life on Earth and elsewhere in the Universe(9).","[Taylor, Alexander I.; Pinheiro, Vitor B.; Morgunov, Alexey S.; Peak-Chew, Sew; Cozens, Christopher; Holliger, Philipp] MRC Lab Mol Biol, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England; [Smola, Matthew J.; Weeks, Kevin M.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Chem, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Herdewijn, Piet] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Rea Inst, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Herdewijn, Piet] Univ Evry, Inst Syst & Synthet Biol, F-91030 Evry, France","Holliger, P (reprint author), MRC Lab Mol Biol, Francis Crick Ave,Cambridge Biomed Campus, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England.",ph1@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk,"Pinheiro, Vitor/O-5514-2017","Pinheiro, Vitor/0000-0003-2491-0028; Smola, Matthew/0000-0002-2123-9681; Taylor, Alexander/0000-0001-7684-1437",Medical Research Council (MRC) [U105178804]; European Science Foundation (ESF); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) UK [09-EuroSYNBIO-OP-013]; European Union; European Research Council [ERC-2012 ADG_20120216/320683]; US National Science Foundation [MCB-1121024]; NSF Graduate Research Fellowship [DGE-1144081],"This work was supported by the Medical Research Council (MRC) programme grant U105178804 (P.

Cytoplasmic dynein-1 (dynein-1) plays roles in mitosis and cellular cargo transport(1), and is implicated in viral infections(2) and neurodegenerative diseases(3). Cytoplasmic dynein-2 (dynein-2) performs intraflagellar transport(4) and is associated with human skeletal ciliopathies(5). Dyneins share a conserved motor domain that couples cycles of ATP hydrolysis with conformational changes to produce movement(6-9). Here we present the crystal structure of the human cytoplasmic dynein-2 motor bound to the ATP-hydrolysis transition state analogue ADP. vanadate(10). The structure reveals a closure of the motor's ring of six AAA+ domains (ATPases associated with various cellular activites: AAA1-AAA6). This induces a steric clash with the linker, the key element for the generation of movement, driving it into a conformation that is primed to produce force. Ring closure also changes the interface between the stalk and buttress coiled-coil extensions of the motor domain. This drives helix sliding in the stalk which causes the microtubule binding domain at its tip to release from the microtubule. Our structure answers the key questions of how ATP hydrolysis leads to linker remodelling and microtubule affinity regulation.","[Schmidt, Helgo; Zalyte, Ruta; Urnavicius, Linas; Carter, Andrew P.] MRC, Mol Biol Lab, Div Struct Studies, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England","Carter, AP (reprint author), MRC, Mol Biol Lab, Div Struct Studies, Francis Crick Ave, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England.",cartera@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk,,"Carter, Andrew/0000-0001-7292-5430","Medical Research Council, UK [MC_UP_A025_1011]; Wellcome Trust New Investigator Award [WT100387]; EMBO Young Investigator Award","This work was funded by the Medical Research Council, UK (MC_UP_A025_1011), a Wellcome Trust New Investigator Award (WT100387) and an EMBO Young Investigator Award.

Here we developed a fine-mapping algorithm to identify candidate causal variants for 21 autoimmune diseases from genotyping data. We integrated these predictions with transcription and cis-regulatory element annotations, derived by mapping RNA and chromatin in primary immune cells, including resting and stimulated CD4(+) T-cell subsets, regulatory T cells, CD8(+) T cells, B cells, and monocytes. We find that similar to 90% of causal variants are non-coding, with similar to 60% mapping to immune-cell enhancers, many of which gain histone acetylation and transcribe enhancer-associated RNA upon immune stimulation. Causal variants tend to occur near binding sites for master regulators of immune differentiation and stimulus-dependent gene activation, but only 10-20% directly alter recognizable transcription factor binding motifs. Rather, mostnon-coding risk variants, including those that alter gene expression, affect non-canonical sequence determinants not well-explained by current gene regulatory models.","[Farh, Kyle Kai-How; Zhu, Jiang; Kleinewietfeld, Markus; Beik, Samantha; Shoresh, Noam; Whitton, Holly; Ryan, Russell J.

To address this need, the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium generated the largest collection so far of human epigenomes for primary cells and tissues. Here we describe the integrative analysis of 111 reference human epigenomes generated as part of the programme, profiled for histone modification patterns, DNA accessibility, DNA methylation and RNA expression. We establish global maps of regulatory elements, define regulatory modules of coordinated activity, and their likely activators and repressors. We show that disease- and trait-associated genetic variants are enriched in tissue-specific epigenomic marks, revealing biologically relevant cell types for diverse human traits, and providing a resource for interpreting the molecular basis of human disease. Our results demonstrate the central role of epigenomic information for understanding gene regulation, cellular differentiation and human disease.","[Kundaje, Anshul; Meuleman, Wouter; Ernst, Jason; Yen, Angela; Kheradpour, Pouya; Zhang, Zhizhuo; Wang, Jianrong; Ward, Lucas D.; Sarkar, Abhishek; Quon, Gerald; Eaton, Matthew L.; Wu, Yi-Chieh; Pfenning, Andreas R.; Wang, Xinchen; Claussnitzer, Melina; Liu, Yaping; Bansal, Mukul S.; Feizi, Soheil; Kim, Ah-Ram; Sallari, Richard C.; Sinnott-Armstrong, Nicholas A.; Kellis, Manolis] MIT, Comp Sci & Artificial Intelligence Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Kundaje, Anshul; Meuleman, Wouter; Ernst, Jason; Yen, Angela; Kheradpour, Pouya; Zhang, Zhizhuo; Wang, Jianrong; Ziller, Michael J.; Ward, Lucas D.; Sarkar, Abhishek; Quon, Gerald; Eaton, Matthew L.; Wu, Yi-Chieh; Pfenning, Andreas R.; Wang, Xinchen; Claussnitzer, Melina; Liu, Yaping; Shoresh, Noam; Epstein, Charles B.; Gjoneska, Elizabeta; Bansal, Mukul S.; Farh, Kai-How; Feizi, Soheil; Kim, Ah-Ram; Polak, Paz; Sallari, Richard C.; Sinnott-Armstrong, Nicholas A.; De Jager, Philip L.; Sunyaev, Shamil; Tsai, Li-Huei; Bernstein, Bradley E.; Meissner, Alexander; Kellis, Manolis] Broad Inst Harvard & MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Kundaje, Anshul] Stanford Univ, Dept Genet, Dept Comp Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Ernst, Jason] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Biol Chem, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Bilenky, Misha; Heravi-Moussavi, Alireza; Mungall, Andrew J.; Moore, Richard; Chuah, Eric; Tam, Angela; Jones, Steven J.

Although dynamic chromatin structures have been identified in the genome, the full scope of chromatin dynamics during mammalian development and lineage specification remains to be determined. By mapping genome-wide chromatin interactions in human embryonic stem(ES) cells and four human ES-cell-derived lineages, we uncover extensive chromatin reorganization during lineage specification. We observe that although self-associating chromatin domains are stable during differentiation, chromatin interactions both within and between domains change in a striking manner, altering 36% of active and inactive chromosomal compartments throughout the genome. By integrating chromatin interaction maps with haplotype-resolved epigenome and transcriptome data sets, we find widespread allelic bias in gene expression correlated with allele-biased chromatin states of linked promoters and distal enhancers. Our results therefore provide a global view of chromatin dynamics and a resource for studying long-range control of gene expression in distinct human cell lineages.","[Dixon, Jesse R.; Jung, Inkyung; Selvaraj, Siddarth; Shen, Yin; Lee, Ah Young; Ye, Zhen; Kim, Audrey; Rajagopal, Nisha; Diao, Yarui; Ren, Bing] Ludwig Inst Canc Res, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Dixon, Jesse R.] Univ Calif San Diego, Med Scientist Training Program, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Selvaraj, Siddarth] Univ Calif San Diego, Bioinformat & Syst Biol Grad Program, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Antosiewicz-Bourget, Jessica E.; Thomson, James A.] Morgridge Inst Res, Madison, WI 53715 USA; [Xie, Wei] Tsinghua Univ, Tsinghua Univ Peking Univ Ctr Life Sci, Sch Life Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Liang, Jing; Zhao, Huimin] Univ Illinois, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Lobanenkov, Victor V.] NIAID, Lab Immunogenet, Twinbrook NIAID Facil 1, Rockville, MD 20852 USA; [Ecker, Joseph R.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Howard Hughes Med Inst, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Thomson, James A.] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Med & Publ Hlth, Dept Cell & Regenerat Biol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Thomson, James A.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Ren, Bing] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Dept Cellular & Mol Med, Inst Genom Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Ren, B (reprint author), Ludwig Inst Canc Res, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",biren@ucsd.edu,"Ecker, Joseph/B-9144-2008; Xie, Wei/J-1380-2017","Ecker, Joseph/0000-0001-5799-5895; Xie, Wei/0000-0003-2126-3849; Lobanenkov, Victor/0000-0001-6665-3635; Jung, Inkyung/0000-0002-5885-2754","Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research; NIH Roadmap Epigenome Project [U01 ES017166, R01 ES024984]; California Institute of Regenerative Medicine [RN2-00905]; Human Frontier Science Program [LT000576/2014-L]","We thank the members of the Ren laboratory for support and suggestions throughout the course of this work.

Analyses of histone modification maps also uncover intriguing characteristics of cis-regulatory elements and tissue-restricted activities of repetitive elements.

Cancer mutations are not distributed uniformly along the human genome. Instead, different human genomic regions vary by up to fivefold in the local density of cancer somatic mutations', posing a fundamental problem for statistical methods used in cancer genomics. Epigenomic organization has been proposed as a major determinant of the cancer mutational landscape(1-5). However, both somatic mutagenesis and epigenomic features are highly cell-type-specific(6-7). We investigated the distribution of mutations in multiple independent samples of diverse cancer types and compared them to cell-type-specific epigenomic features. Here we show that chromatin accessibility and modification, together with replication timing, explain up to 86% of the variance in mutation rates along cancer genomes. The best predictors of local somatic mutation density are epigenomic features derived from the most likely cell type of origin of the corresponding malignancy. Moreover, we find that cell-of-origin chromatin features are much stronger determinants of cancer mutation profiles than chromatin features of matched cancer cell lines. Furthermore, we show that the cell type of origin of a cancer can be accurately determined based on the distribution of mutations along its genome. Thus, the DNA sequence of a cancer genome encompasses a wealth of information about the identity and epigenomic features of its cell of origin.","[Polak, Paz; Sunyaev, Shamil R.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Div Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Polak, Paz; Sunyaev, Shamil R.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Polak, Paz; Koren, Amnon; Lawrence, Michael S.; Sunyaev, Shamil R.] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Karlic, Rosa; Vlahovicek, Kristian] Univ Zagreb, Bioinformat Grp, Dept Mol Biol, Div Biol,Fac Sci, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Koren, Amnon] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Thurman, Robert; Sandstrom, Richard; Reynolds, Alex; Rynes, Eric; Stamatoyannopoulos, John A.] Univ Washington, Dept Genome Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Vlahovicek, Kristian] Univ Oslo, Dept Informat, NO-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Stamatoyannopoulos, John A.] Univ Washington, Div Oncol, Dept Med, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Sunyaev, SR (reprint author), Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Div Genet, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",jstam@u.washington.edu; ssunyaev@rics.bwh.harvard.edu,"Vlahovicek, Kristian/D-9661-2011","Vlahovicek, Kristian/0000-0002-5705-2464","NIH [R01 MH101244, U54 CA143874, U01 ES017156, P01 HL53750, U54 HG007010]; Integra-Life Seventh Framework Program [315997]; EMBO [1431/2006]","This work was supported by NIH grants R01 MH101244, U54 CA143874 to S.R.S. and U01 ES017156, P01 HL53750, U54 HG007010 to J.A.S.

Several genes have been implicated in AD, but chromatin state alterations during neurodegeneration remain uncharacterized. Here we profile transcriptional and chromatin state dynamics across early and late pathology in the hippocampus of an inducible mouse model of AD-like neurodegeneration. We find a coordinated down-regulation of synaptic plasticity genes and regulatory regions, and upregulation of immune response genes and regulatory regions, which are targeted by factors that belong to the ETS family of transcriptional regulators, including PU.1. Human regions orthologous to increasing-level enhancers show immune-cell-specific enhancer signatures as well as immune cell expression quantitative trait loci, while decreasing-level enhancer orthologues show fetal-brain-specific enhancer activity. Notably, AD-associated genetic variants are specifically enriched in increasing-level enhancer orthologues, implicating immune processes in AD predisposition. Indeed, increasing enhancers overlap known AD loci lacking protein-altering variants, and implicate additional loci that do not reach genome-wide significance. Our results reveal new insights into the mechanisms of neurodegeneration and establish the mouse as a useful model for functional studies of AD regulatory regions.","[Gjoneska, Elizabeta; Mathys, Hansruedi; Tsai, Li-Huei] MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Picower Inst Learning & Memory, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Gjoneska, Elizabeta; Pfenning, Andreas R.; Quon, Gerald; Kundaje, Anshul; Tsai, Li-Huei; Kellis, Manolis] Broad Inst Harvard Univ & Massachusetts Inst Tech, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Pfenning, Andreas R.; Quon, Gerald; Kundaje, Anshul; Kellis, Manolis] MIT, Comp Sci & Artificial Intelligence Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Kundaje, Anshul] Stanford Univ, Dept Genet, Dept Comp Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Tsai, LH (reprint author), MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Picower Inst Learning & Memory, E25-618, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",lhtsai@mit.edu; manoli@mit.edu,,/0000-0002-3447-9801,"Belfer Neurodegeneration Consortium; NIH/NINDS/NIA [RO1NS078839]; Swiss National Science Foundation [P2BSP3_151885]; NIH/NHGRI [R01HG004037-07, RC1HG005334]","We thank A.

Li could be produced by Big Bang nucleosynthesis, interactions of energetic cosmic rays with interstellar matter, evolved low-mass stars, novae, and supernova explosions. Chemical evolution models and observed stellar Li abundances suggest that at least half the Li may have been produced in red giants, asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, and novae(1-3). No direct evidence, however, for the supply of Li from evolved stellar objects to the Galactic medium has hitherto been found. Here we report the detection of highly blue-shifted resonance lines of the singly ionized radioactive isotope of beryllium, Be-7, in the near-ultraviolet spectra of the classical nova V339 Del (Nova Delphini 2013) 38 to 48 days after the explosion. Be-7 decays to form Li-7 within a short time (half-life of 53.22 days(4)). The Be-7 was created during the nova explosion via the alpha-capture reaction He-3(alpha,gamma)Be-7 (ref. 5). This result supports the theoretical prediction that a significant amount of 7Li is produced in classical nova explosions.","[Tajitsu, Akito] Subaru Telescope, Natl Astron Observ Japan, Hilo, HI 96720 USA; [Sadakane, Kozo] Osaka Kyoiku Univ, Astron Inst, Osaka 5828582, Japan; [Naito, Hiroyuki] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648602, Japan; [Naito, Hiroyuki] Nayoro Observ, Nayoro, Hokkaido 0960066, Japan; [Arai, Akira] Univ Hyogo, Ctr Astron, Sayo, Hyogo 6795313, Japan; [Arai, Akira] Kyoto Sangyo Univ, Koyama Astron Observ, Kita Ku, Kyoto 6038555, Japan; [Aoki, Wako] Natl Astron Observ Japan, Mitaka, Tokyo 1818588, Japan","Tajitsu, A (reprint author), Subaru Telescope, Natl Astron Observ Japan, 650 North Aohoku Pl, Hilo, HI 96720 USA.",tajitsu@naoj.org,,,,,,41,25,25,0,13,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,19-Feb,2015,518,7539,,,,,381,384,,10.1038/nature14161,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,CB3SA,WOS:000349547400038,25693569,No,,,11/20/17

Although the ultrafast dynamics of bond breaking have been studied intensively using time-resolved techniques(1-3),, it is very difficult to study the structural dynamics of bond making, mainly because of its bimolecular nature. It is especially difficult to initiate and follow diffusion-limited bond formation in solution with ultrahigh time resolution. Here we use femtosecond time-resolved X-ray solution scattering to visualize the formation of a gold trimer complex, [Au(CN)(2)(-)](3) in real time without the limitation imposed by slow diffusion. This photoexcited gold trimer, which has weakly bound gold atoms in the ground state(4-6), undergoes a sequence of structural changes, and our experiments probe the dynamics of individual reaction steps, including covalent bond formation, the bent-to-linear transition, bond contraction and tetramer formation with a time resolution of 500 femtoseconds. We also determined the three-dimensional structures of reaction intermediates with sub-angstrom spatial resolution. This work demonstrates that it is possible to track in detail and in real time the structural changes that occur during a chemical reaction in solution using X-ray free-electron lasers' and advanced analysis of time-resolved solution scattering data.","[Kim, Kyung Hwan; Kim, Jong Goo; Oang, Key Young; Kim, Taewu; Ki, Hosung; Jo, Junbeom; Park, Sungjun; Ryoo, Ryong; Ihee, Hyotcherl] Inst for Basic Sci Korea, Ctr Nanomat & Chem React, Taejon 305701, South Korea; [Kim, Kyung Hwan; Kim, Jong Goo; Oang, Key Young; Kim, Taewu; Ki, Hosung; Jo, Junbeom; Park, Sungjun; Ryoo, Ryong; Ihee, Hyotcherl] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Chem, Taejon 305701, South Korea; [Nozawa, Shunsuke; Sato, Tokushi; Adachi, Shin-ichi] High Energy Accelerator Res Org, Inst Mat Struct Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050801, Japan; [Song, Changyong; Sato, Takahiro; Ogawa, Kanade; Yabashi, Makina; Ishikawa, Tetsuya] RIKEN SPring 8 Ctr, Sayo, Hyogo 6795148, Japan; [Togashi, Tadashi; Tono, Kensuke] Japan Synchrotron Radiat Res Inst, Sayo, Hyogo 6795198, Japan; [Kim, Joonghan] Catholic Univ Korea, Dept Chem, Puchon 420743, South Korea; [Kim, Jeongho] Inha Univ, Dept Chem, Inchon 402751, South Korea; [Adachi, Shin-ichi] Grad Univ Adv Studies, Dept Mat Struct Sci, Sch High Energy Accelerator Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050801, Japan","Ihee, H (reprint author), Inst for Basic Sci Korea, Ctr Nanomat & Chem React, Taejon 305701, South Korea.",hyotcherl.ihee@kaist.ac.kr; shinichi.adachi@kek.jp,"; Ryoo, Ryong /B-1090-2009; Ihee, Hyotcherl/C-1614-2011; Yabashi, Makina/A-2832-2015; Ishikawa, Tetsuya/I-4775-2012; Sato, Takahiro/C-2306-2017","Kim, Jeongho/0000-0003-4085-293X; Yabashi, Makina/0000-0002-2472-1684; Ishikawa, Tetsuya/0000-0002-6906-9909; Ryoo, Ryong/0000-0003-0047-3329","X-ray Free Electron Laser Priority Strategic Program of MEXT, Japan; PRESTO/JST; Innovative Areas 'Artificial Photosynthesis (AnApple)' from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [25107527]; Basic Science Research Program through National Research Foundation of Korea - Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning [NRF-2014R1A1A1002511];  [IBS-R004-G2]","We thank M.

How coastal upwelling regimes might change in a warming climate is therefore a question of vital importance(4,5). Although enhanced land-ocean differential heating due to greenhouse warming has been proposed to intensify coastal upwelling by strengthening alongshore winds', analyses of observations and previous climate models have provided little consensus on historical and projected trends in coastal upwelling(7-13). Here we show that there are strong and consistent changes in the timing, intensity and spatial heterogeneity of coastal upwelling in response to future warming in most Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems (EBUSs). An ensemble of climate models shows that by the end of the twenty-first century the upwelling season will start earlier, end later and become more intense at high but not low latitudes. This projected increase in upwelling intensity and duration at high latitudes will result in a substantial reduction of the existing latitudinal variation in coastal upwelling. These patterns are consistent across three of the four EBUSs (Canary, Benguela and Humboldt, but not California). The lack of upwelling intensification and greater uncertainty associated with the California EBUS may reflect regional controls associated with the atmospheric response to climate change. Given the strong linkages between upwelling and marine ecosystems(14,15), the projected changes in the intensity, timing and spatial structure of coastal upwelling may influence the geographical distribution of marine biodiversity.","[Wang, Daiwei; Ganguly, Auroop R.] Northeastern Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Sustainabil & Data Sci Lab, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Gouhier, Tarik C.] Northeastern Univ, Ctr Marine Sci, Dept Marine & Environm Sci, Nahant, MA 01908 USA; [Menge, Bruce A.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Wang, DW (reprint author), Northeastern Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Sustainabil & Data Sci Lab, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",dw2116@gmail.com,"Wang, Daiwei/E-4265-2015","Wang, Daiwei/0000-0003-3685-1416",Northeastern University's Interdisciplinary Research Program; US National Science Foundation's Expeditions in Computing program [1029711],"This work was funded by grants from Northeastern University's Interdisciplinary Research Program and the US National Science Foundation's Expeditions in Computing program (award no. 1029711).

The Lau Basin, with an abundance of spreading ridges at different distances from the subduction zone, provides an opportunity to distinguish the effects of these two different melting processes on magma production and crust formation. Here we present constraints on the three-dimensional distribution of partial melt inferred from seismic velocities obtained from Rayleigh wave tomography using land and ocean-bottom seismographs. Low seismic velocities beneath the Central Lau Spreading Centre and the northern Eastern Lau Spreading Centre extend deeper and westwards into the back-arc, suggesting that these spreading centres are fed by melting along upwelling zones from the west, and helping to explain geochemical differences with the Valu Fa Ridge to the south(2), which has no distinct deep low-seismic-velocity anomalies. A region of low S-wave velocity, interpreted as resulting from high melt content, is imaged in the mantle wedge beneath the Central Lau Spreading Centre and the northeastern Lau Basin, even where no active spreading centre currently exists. This low-seismic-velocity anomaly becomes weaker with distance southward along the Eastern Lau Spreading Centre and the Valu Fa Ridge, in contrast to the inferred increase in magmatic productivity(1). We propose that the anomaly variations result from changes in the efficiency of melt extraction, with the decrease in melt to the south correlating with increased fractional melting and higher water content in the magma. Water released from the slab may greatly reduce the melt viscosity(3) or increase grain size(4), or both, thereby facilitating melt transport.","[Wei, S.

Excitatory connection amplitudes between pairs of cortical neurons vary over two orders of magnitude, comprising only very few strong connections among many weaker ones(1-9). Although this highly skewed distribution of connection strengths is observed in diverse cortical areas(1-9), its functional significance remains unknown: it is not clear how connection strength relates to neuronal response properties, nor how strong and weak inputs contribute to information processing in local microcircuits. Here we reveal that the strength of connections between layer 2/3 (L2/3) pyramidal neurons in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) obeys a simple rule-the few strong connections occur between neurons with most correlated responses, while only weak connections link neurons with uncorrelated responses. Moreover, we show that strong and reciprocal connections occur between cells with similar spatial receptive field structure. Although weak connections far outnumber strong connections, each neuron receives the majority of its local excitation from a small number of strong inputs provided by the few neurons with similar responses to visual features. By dominating recurrent excitation, these infrequent yet powerful inputs disproportionately contribute to feature preference and selectivity. Therefore, our results show that the apparently complex organization of excitatory connection strength reflects the similarity of neuronal responses, and suggest that rare, strong connections mediate stimulus-specific response amplification in cortical microcircuits.","[Cossell, Lee; Iacaruso, Maria Florencia; Houlton, Rachael; Sader, Elie N.; Ko, Ho; Hofer, Sonja B.; Mrsic-Flogel, Thomas D.] UCL, Dept Neurosci Physiol & Pharmacol, London WC1E 6DE, England; [Cossell, Lee; Iacaruso, Maria Florencia; Muir, Dylan R.; Hofer, Sonja B.; Mrsic-Flogel, Thomas D.] Univ Basel, Biozentrum, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; [Ko, Ho] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Fac Med, Lui Che Woo Inst Innovat Med, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Ko, Ho] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Fac Med, Chow Yuk Ho Technol Ctr Innovat Med, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Mrsic-Flogel, TD (reprint author), UCL, Dept Neurosci Physiol & Pharmacol, 21 Univ St, London WC1E 6DE, England.",thomas.mrsic-flogel@unibas.ch,"Muir, Dylan/E-1910-2011; Ko, Ho/I-7513-2016","Muir, Dylan/0000-0003-3856-826X; Ko, Ho/0000-0002-0254-3274",Wellcome Trust [095074]; European Research council; UCL; University of Basel Young Researchers fund,"We thank K.

The key reaction cycle intermediate of the soluble form of MMO(sMMO) is termed compoundQ (Q). Q contains a unique dinuclear Fe-IV cluster that reacts with methane to break an exceptionally strong 105 kcal mol(-1) C-H bond and insert one oxygen atom(1,2). No other biological oxidant, except that found in the particulate form of MMO, is capable of such catalysis. The structure of Q remains controversial despite numerous spectroscopic, computational and synthetic model studies(2-7). A definitive structural assignment can be made from resonance Raman vibrational spectroscopy but, despite efforts over the past two decades, no vibrational spectrum of Q has yet been obtained. Here we report the core structures of Q and the following product complex, compound T, using time-resolved resonance Raman spectroscopy (TR3). TR3 permits fingerprinting of intermediates by their unique vibrational signatures through extended signal averaging for short-lived species. We report unambiguous evidence that Q possesses a bis-mu-oxo diamond core structure and show that both bridging oxygens originate from O-2. This observation strongly supports a homolytic mechanism for O-Obond cleavage. We also show that T retains a single oxygen atom from O-2 as a bridging ligand, while the other oxygen atom is incorporated into the product(8). Capture of the extreme oxidizing potential of Q is of great contemporary interest for bioremediation and the development of synthetic approaches to methane-based alternative fuels and chemical industry feedstocks. Insight into the formation and reactivity of Q from the structure reported here is an important step towards harnessing this potential.","[Banerjee, Rahul; Lipscomb, John D.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Biochem Mol Biol & Biophys, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Banerjee, Rahul; Lipscomb, John D.] Univ Minnesota, Ctr Met Biocatalysis, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Proshlyakov, Yegor; Proshlyakov, Denis A.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Chem, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Proshlyakov, DA (reprint author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Chem, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",lipsc001@umn.edu; dapro@chemistry.msu.edu,"Banerjee, Rahul/M-2316-2016","Banerjee, Rahul/0000-0002-8193-7369; Lipscomb, John/0000-0002-8158-5594","NIH [GM40466, GM100943, GM096132]","We thank G.

To increase our understanding of the genetic basis of body fat distribution and its molecular links to cardiometabolic traits, here we conduct genome-wide association meta-analyses of traits related to waist and hip circumferences in up to 224,459 individuals. We identify 49 loci (33 new) associated with waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for body mass index (BMI), and an additional 19 loci newly associated with related waist and hip circumference measures (P < 5 x 10(-8)). In total, 20 of the 49 waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI loci show significant sexual dimorphism, 19 of which display a stronger effect in women. The identified loci were enriched for genes expressed in adipose tissue and for putative regulatory elements in adipocytes. Pathway analyses implicated adipogenesis, angiogenesis, transcriptional regulation and insulin resistance as processes affecting fat distribution, providing insight into potential pathophysiological mechanisms.","[Shungin, Dmitry; Franks, Paul W.] Umea Univ, Med Unit, Dept Publ Hlth & Clin Med, S-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Shungin, Dmitry; Renstrom, Frida; Franks, Paul W.] Lund Univ, Ctr Diabet, Skane Univ Hosp, Dept Clin Sci,Genet & Mol Epidemiol Unit, S-20502 Malmo, Sweden; [Shungin, Dmitry; Johansson, Ingegerd] Umea Univ, Dept Oncol, S-90185 Umea, Sweden; [Winkler, Thomas W.; Olden, Matthias; Heid, Iris M.] Univ Regensburg, Inst Epidemiol & Prevent Med, Dept Genet Epidemiol, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany; [Croteau-Chonka, Damien C.; Buchkovich, Martin L.; Roman, Tamara S.; Mohlke, Karen L.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Genet, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Croteau-Chonka, Damien C.; Hunter, David J.; Qi, Lu] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Channing Div Network Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Croteau-Chonka, Damien C.; Estrada, Karol; Ridker, Paul M.; Chasman, Daniel I.; Hunter, David J.; Qi, Lu] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Ferreira, Teresa; Maegi, Reedik; Drong, Alexander W.; Randall, Joshua C.; Goel, Anuj; Prokopenko, Inga; Juliusdottir, Thorhildur; Mahajan, Anubha; Rayner, Nigel W.; Robertson, Neil R.; Hedman, Asa K.; Keildson, Sarah; Perry, John R.

To understand the genetic basis of obesity better, here we conduct a genome-wide association study and Metabochip meta-analysis of body mass index (BMI), a measure commonly used to define obesity and assess adiposity, in upto 339,224 individuals. This analysis identifies 97 BMI-associated loci (P < 5 x 10(-8)), 56 of which are novel. Five loci demonstrate clear evidence of several independent association signals, and many loci have significant effects on other metabolic phenotypes. The 97 loci account for similar to 2.7% of BMI variation, and genome-wide estimates suggest that common variation accounts for >20% of BMI variation. Pathway analyses provide strong support for a role of the central nervous systemin obesity susceptibility and implicate new genes and pathways, including those related to synaptic function, glutamate signalling, insulin secretion/action, energy metabolism, lipid biology and adipogenesis.","[Locke, Adam E.; Bragg-Gresham, L.; Jackson, Anne U.; Stringham, Heather M.; Abecasis, Goncalo R.; Boehnke, Michael] Univ Michigan, Dept Biostat, Ctr Stat Genet, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Kahali, Bratati; Powell, Corey; Speliotes, Elizabeth K.] Univ Michigan, Dept Internal Med, Div Gastroenterol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Kahali, Bratati; Powell, Corey; Speliotes, Elizabeth K.] Univ Michigan, Dept Computat Med & Bioinformat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Berndt, Sonja I.; Wang, Zhaoming; Jacobs, Kevin B.; Chanock, Stephen J.] NCI, Div Canc Epidemiol & Genet, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Justice, Anne E.; Monda, Keri L.; North, Kari E.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Epidemiol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Pers, Tune H.; Vedantam, Sailaja; Esko, Tonu; Palmer, Cameron D.; Salem, Rany M.; Hirschhorn, Joel N.] Boston Childrens Hosp, Div Endocrinol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Pers, Tune H.; Vedantam, Sailaja; Esko, Tonu; Palmer, Cameron D.; Salem, Rany M.; Hirschhorn, Joel N.] Boston Childrens Hosp, Div Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Pers, Tune H.; Vedantam, Sailaja; Esko, Tonu; Palmer, Cameron D.; Salem, Rany M.; Hirschhorn, Joel N.] Boston Childrens Hosp, Ctr Basic & Translat Obes Res, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Pers, Tune H.; Vedantam, Sailaja; Esko, Tonu; Palmer, Cameron D.; Estrada, Karol; Handsaker, Robert E.; Kathiresan, Sekar; McCarroll, Steven A.; Salem, Rany M.; Lindgren, Cecilia M.; Hirschhorn, Joel N.] Broad Inst Massachusetts Inst Technol & Harvard U, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Pers, Tune H.; Esko, Tonu; Handsaker, Robert E.; McCarroll, Steven A.; Salem, Rany M.; Hirschhorn, Joel N.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Pers, Tune H.] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Syst Biol, Ctr Biol Sequence Anal, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Day, Felix R.; Luan, Jian'an; Zhao, Jing Hua; Scott, Robert A.; Forouhi, Nita G.; Langenberg, Claudia; Ong, Ken K.; Wareham, Nicholas J.; Loos, Ruth J.

To provide useful information about location, grids must be stably anchored to an external reference frame. The mechanisms underlying this anchoring process have remained elusive. Here we show in differently sized familiar square enclosures that the axes of the grids are offset from the walls by an angle that minimizes symmetry with the borders of the environment. This rotational offset is invariably accompanied by an elliptic distortion of the grid pattern. Reversing the ellipticity analytically by a shearing transformation removes the angular offset. This, together with the near-absence of rotation in novel environments, suggests that the rotation emerges through non-coaxial strain as a function of experience. The systematic relationship between rotation and distortion of the grid pattern points to shear forces arising from anchoring to specific geometric reference points as key elements of the mechanism for alignment of grid patterns to the external world.","[Stensola, Tor; Stensola, Hanne; Moser, May-Britt; Moser, Edvard I.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Kavli Inst Syst Neurosci, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Stensola, Tor; Stensola, Hanne; Moser, May-Britt; Moser, Edvard I.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Ctr Neural Computat, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway","Stensola, T (reprint author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Kavli Inst Syst Neurosci, Olav Kyrres Gate 9, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",tor.stensola@ntnu.no; edvard.moser@ntnu.no,,,"European Research Council [232608, 338865]; European Commission [600725]; Kavli Foundation; Louis-Jeantet Prize for Medicine; Centre of Excellence funding scheme of the Research Council of Norway (Centre for the Biology of Memory) [145993]; Centre of Excellence funding scheme of the Research Council of Norway (Centre for Neural Computation) [223262]","We thank M.

A number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain the origin of binary and multiple star systems, including core fragmentation, disk fragmentation and stellar capture(1-3). Observations show that protostellar and pre-main-sequence multiplicity is higher than the multiplicity found in field stars(4-7), which suggests that dynamical interactions occur early, splitting up multiple systems and modifying the initial stellar separations(8,9). Without direct, high-resolution observations of forming systems, however, it is difficult to determine the true initial multiplicity and the dominant binary formation mechanism. Here we report observations of a wide-separation (greater than 1,000 astronomical units) quadruple system composed of a young protostar and three gravitationally bound dense gas condensations. These condensations are the result of fragmentation of dense gas filaments, and each condensation is expected to forma star on a time-scale of 40,000 years. We determine that the closest pair will form a bound binary, while the quadruple stellar system itself is bound but unstable on timescales of 500,000 years (comparable to the lifetime of the embedded protostellar phase(10)). These observations suggest that filament fragmentation on length scales of about 5,000 astronomical units offers a viable pathway to the formation of multiple systems.","[Pineda, Jaime E.] ETH, Inst Astron, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Offner, Stella S.

The ices are mixed with the refractory material either as an icy conglomerate(1), or as an aggregate of pre-solar grains (grains that existed prior to the formation of the Solar System), mantled by an ice layer(2,3). The presence of water-ice grains in periodic comets is now well established(4-6). Modelling of infrared spectra obtained about ten kilometres from the nucleus of comet Hartley 2 suggests that larger dust particles are being physically decoupled from fine-grained water-ice particles that may be aggregates(7), which supports the icy-conglomerate model. It is known that comets build up crusts of dust that are subsequently shed as they approach perihelion(8-10). Micrometre-sized interplanetary dust particles collected in the Earth's stratosphere and certain micrometeorites are assumed to be of cometary origin(11-13). Here we report that grains collected from the Jupiter-family comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko come from a dusty crust that quenches the material outflow activity at the comet surface(14). The larger grains (exceeding 50 micrometres across) are fluffy (with porosity over 50 per cent), and many shattered when collected on the target plate, suggesting that they are agglomerates of entities in the size range of interplanetary dust particles. Their surfaces are generally rich in sodium, which explains the high sodium abundance in cometary meteoroids(15). The particles collected to date therefore probably represent parent material of interplanetary dust particles. This argues against comet dust being composed of a silicate core mantled by organic refractory material and then by a mixture of water-dominated ices(2,3). At its previous recurrence (orbital period 6.5 years), the comet's dust production doubled when it was between 2.7 and 2.5 astronomical units from the Sun(14), indicating that this was when the nucleus shed its mantle. Once the mantle is shed, unprocessed material starts to supply the developing coma, radically changing its dust component, which then also contains icy grains, as detected during encounters with other comets closer to the Sun(4,5).","[Schulz, Rita] European Space Agcy, Sci Support Off, NL-2200 AG Noordwijk, Netherlands; [Hilchenbach, Martin; Kissel, Jochen; Fischer, Henning; Merouane, Sihane; Paquette, John; Stenzel, Oliver] Max Planck Inst Sonnensyst Forsch, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Langevin, Yves; Baklouti, Donia] Univ Paris 11, CNRS, Inst Astrophys Spatiale, F-91405 Orsay, France; [Silen, Johan; Ryno, Jouni] Finnish Meteorol Inst, Observat Serv, FI-00560 Helsinki, Finland; [Briois, Christelle; Bardyn, Anais; Thirkell, Laurent] Univ Orleans, CNRS, Lab Phys & Chim Environm & Espace LPC2E, F-45071 Orleans, France; [Engrand, Cecile; Godard, Marie] Univ Paris 11, CNRS, IN2P3, Ctr Sci Nucl & Sci Mat,UMR8609, F-91405 Orsay, France; [Hornung, Klaus] Univ Bundeswehr, D-85577 Neubiberg, Germany; [Bardyn, Anais; Cottin, Herve; Fray, Nicolas] Univ Paris Est Creteil, LISA, CNRS, UMR 7583, F-94000 Creteil, France; [Lehto, Harry; Zaprudin, Boris] Univ Paris Diderot, Inst Pierre Simon Laplace, F-94000 Creteil, France; [Le Roy, Lena] Univ Turku, Dept Phys & Astron, Tuorla Observ Vaisantie, Piikkio 21500, Finland; [Orthous-Daunay, Francois-Regis] Univ Bern, CSH, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Siljestrom, Sandra] Univ Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, Inst Planetol & Astrophys Grenoble, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Varmuza, Kurt] SP Tech Res Inst Sweden, Dept Chem Mat & Surfaces, S-50115 Boras, Sweden; Vienna Univ Technol, Inst Stat & Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie, A-1040 Vienna, Austria","Schulz, R (reprint author), European Space Agcy, Sci Support Off, Keplerlaan 1,Postbus 299, NL-2200 AG Noordwijk, Netherlands.",rita.schulz@esa.int,"Cottin, Herve/H-5654-2013","Cottin, Herve/0000-0001-9170-5265; Le Roy, Lena/0000-0002-5984-6153; Siljestrom, Sandra/0000-0002-4975-6074",national funding agencies of Germany (DLR) [50QP1302]; national funding agencies of France (CNES); national funding agencies of Austria; national funding agencies of Finland; ESA Technical Directorate; Swedish National Space Board [121/11],"COSIMA was built by a consortium led by the Max-Planck-Institut fur Extraterrestrische Physik, Garching, Germany, in collaboration with the Laboratoire de Physique et Chimie de l'Environnement et de l'Espace, Orleans, France, the Institut d'Astrophysique Spatiale, CNRS/Universite Paris Sud, Orsay, France, the Finnish Meteorological Institute, Helsinki, Finland, the Universitat Wuppertal, Wuppertal, Germany, von Hoerner und Sulger GmbH, Schwetzingen, Germany, the Universitat der Bundeswehr, Neubiberg, Germany, the Institut fur Physik, Forschungszentrum Seibersdorf, Seibersdorf, Austria, the Institut fur Weltraumforschung, Osterreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften, Graz, Austria and is led by the Max-Planck-Institut fur Sonnensystemforschung, Gottingen, Germany.

Leading hypotheses put forward to explain glacial-interglacial atmospheric CO2 variations invoke changes in deep-ocean carbon storage(1,2), probably modulated by processes in the Southern Ocean, where much of the deep ocean is ventilated(3). A central aspect of such models is that, during deglaciations, an isolated glacial deep-ocean carbon reservoir is reconnected with the atmosphere, driving the atmospheric CO2 rise observed in ice-core records(4-6). However, direct documentation of changes in surface ocean carbon content and the associated transfer of carbon to the atmosphere during deglaciations has been hindered by the lack of proxy reconstructions that unambiguously reflect the oceanic carbonate system. Radiocarbon activity tracks changes in ocean ventilation(6), but not in ocean carbon content, whereas proxies that record increased deglacial upwelling(4,7) do not constrain the proportion of upwelled carbon that is degassed relative to that which is taken up by the biological pump. Here we apply the boron isotope pH proxy in planktic foraminifera to two sediment cores from the sub-Antarctic Atlantic and the eastern equatorial Pacific as a more direct tracer of oceanic CO2 outgassing. We show that surface waters at both locations, which partly derive from deep water upwelled in the Southern Ocean(8,9), became a significant source of carbon to the atmosphere during the last deglaciation, when the concentration of atmospheric CO2 was increasing. This oceanic CO2 outgassing supports the view that the ventilation of a deep-ocean carbon reservoir in the Southern Ocean had a key role in the deglacial CO2 rise, although our results allow for the possibility that processes operating in other regions may also have been important for the glacial-interglacial ocean-atmosphere exchange of carbon.","[Martinez-Boti, M.

If this water is delivered to the ice sheet base it may have important consequences for ice dynamics. For example, basal water distributed in a diffuse network can decrease basal friction(1,2) and accelerate ice flow(3-8), whereas channelized basal water can move quickly to the ice margin, where it can alter fjord circulation and submarine melt rates(9,10). Less certain is whether surface meltwater can be trapped and stored in subglacial lakes beneath large ice sheets. Here we show that a subglacial lake in Greenland drained quickly, as seen in the collapse of the ice surface, and then refilled from surface meltwater input. We use digital elevation models from stereo satellite imagery and airborne measurements to resolve elevation changes during the evolution of the surface and basal hydrologic systems at the Flade Isblink ice cap in northeast Greenland. During the autumn of 2011, a collapse basin about 70 metres deep and about 0.4 cubic kilometres in volume formed near the southern summit of the ice cap as a subglacial lake drained into a nearby fjord. Over the next two years, rapid uplift of the floor of the basin (which is approximately 8.4 square kilometres in area) occurred as surface meltwater flowed into crevasses around the basin margin and refilled the subglacial lake. Our observations show that surface meltwater can be trapped and stored at the bed of an ice sheet. Sensible and latent heat released by this trapped meltwater could soften nearby colder basal ice(11) and alter downstream ice dynamics(12,13). Heat transport associated with meltwater trapped in subglacial lakes should be considered when predicting how ice sheet behaviour will change in a warming climate.","[Willis, Michael J.] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Willis, Michael J.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Geol Sci, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Herried, Bradley G.] Univ Minnesota, Polar Geospatial Ctr, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Bevis, Michael G.] Ohio State Univ, Sch Earth Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Bell, Robin E.] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA","Willis, MJ (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",mike.willis@cornell.edu,,,"US National Science Foundation [ARC-1111882, ANT-1043681]","The copyright for the satellite imagery is held by DigitalGlobe, Inc.

Key questions in the debate on the origin of such behaviour are whether this innovation is restricted to Homo sapiens, and whether it has a uniquely African origin(1). Here we report on a fossil freshwater shell assemblage from the Hauptknochenschicht ('main bone layer') of Trinil (Java, Indonesia), the type locality of Homo erectus discovered by Eugene Dubois in 1891 (refs 2 and 3). In the Dubois collection(in the Naturalis museum, Leiden, The Netherlands) we found evidence for freshwater shellfish consumption by hominins, one unambiguous shell tool, and a shell with a geometric engraving. We dated sediment contained in the shells with Ar-40/Ar-39 and luminescence dating methods, obtaining a maximum age of 0.54 +/- 0.10 million years and a minimum age of 0.43 +/- 0.05 million years. This implies that the Trinil Hauptkno-chenschicht is younger than previously estimated. Together, our data indicate that the engraving was made by Homo erectus, and that it is considerably older than the oldest geometric engravings described so far(4,5). Although it is at present not possible to assess the function or meaning of the engraved shell, this discovery suggests that engraving abstract patterns was in the realm of Asian Homo erectus cognition and neuromotor control.","[Joordens, Josephine C.

Such an impressive and constant regularity prompted suggestions that grid cells represent a universal and environmental-invariant metric for navigation(1,2). Originally the properties of grid patterns were believed to be independent of the shape of the environment and this notion has dominated almost all theoretical grid cell models(3-6). However, several studies indicate that environmental boundaries influence grid firing(7-10), though the strength, nature and longevity of this effect is unclear. Here we show that grid orientation, scale, symmetry and homogeneity are strongly and permanently affected by environmental geometry. We found that grid patterns orient to the walls of polarized enclosures such as squares, but not circles. Furthermore, the hexagonal grid symmetry is permanently broken in highly polarized environments such as trapezoids, the pattern being more elliptical and less homogeneous. Our results provide compelling evidence for the idea that environmental boundaries compete with the internal organization of the grid cell system to drive grid firing. Notably, grid cell activity is more local than previously thought and as a consequence cannot provide a universal spatial metric in all environments.","[Krupic, Julija; Bauza, Marius; Burton, Stephen; Barry, Caswell; O'Keefe, John] UCL, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, London WC1E 6BT, England; [O'Keefe, John] UCL, Sainsbury Wellcome Ctr, London WC1E 6BT, England","Krupic, J (reprint author), UCL, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Mortimer St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",j.krupic@ucl.ac.uk,,"Bauza, Marius/0000-0003-3514-8382",Wellcome Trust; Gatsby Charitable Foundation,We thank J.

Reduction in synapse number is a consistent early feature of neurodegenerative diseases(2,3), suggesting deficient compensatory mechanisms. Although much is known about toxic processes leading to synaptic dysfunction and loss in these disorders(2,3), how synaptic regeneration is affected is unknown. In hibernating mammals, cooling induces loss of synaptic contacts, which are reformed on rewarming, a form of structural plasticity(4,5). We have found that similar changes occur in artificially cooled laboratory rodents. Cooling and hibernation also induce a number of cold-shock proteins in the brain, including the RNA binding protein, RBM3 (ref. 6). The relationship of such proteins to structural plasticity is unknown. Here we show that synapse regeneration is impaired in mouse models of neurodegenerative disease, in association with the failure to induce RBM3. In both prion-infected and 5XFAD (Alzheimer-type) mice(7), the capacity to regenerate synapses after cooling declined in parallel with the loss of induction of RBM3. Enhanced expression of RBM3 in the hippocampus prevented this deficit and restored the capacity for synapse reassembly after cooling. RBM3 overexpression, achieved either by boosting endogenous levels through hypothermia before the loss of the RBM3 response or by lentiviral delivery, resulted in sustained synaptic protection in 5XFAD mice and throughout the course of prion disease, preventing behavioural deficits and neuronal loss and significantly prolonging survival. In contrast, knockdown of RBM3 exacerbated synapse loss in both models and accelerated disease and prevented the neuroprotective effects of cooling. Thus, deficient synapse regeneration, mediated at least in part by failure of the RBM3 stress response, contributes to synapse loss throughout the course of neurodegenerative disease. The data support enhancing cold-shock pathways as potential protective therapies in neurodegenerative disorders.","[Peretti, Diego; Bastide, Amandine; Radford, Helois; Verity, Nicholas; Molloy, Colin; Martin, Maria Guerra; Moreno, Julie A.; Steinert, Joern R.; Smith, Tim; Dinsdale, David; Willis, Anne E.; Mallucci, Giovanna R.] Univ Leicester, Toxicol Unit, MRC, Leicester LE1 9HN, Leics, England; [Mallucci, Giovanna R.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Clin Neurosci, Cambridge CB2 0AH, England","Mallucci, GR (reprint author), Univ Leicester, Toxicol Unit, MRC, Hodgkin Bldg,Lancaster Rd, Leicester LE1 9HN, Leics, England.",gm522@cam.ac.uk,,"Steinert, Joern R/0000-0003-1640-0845","Medical Research Council, UK","We thank J.

There is an additional layer of complexity, in that tumour evolution may be influenced by selective pressure provided by therapy, in a similar fashion to that occurring in infectious diseases. Here we studied tumour genomic evolution in a patient (index patient) with metastatic breast cancer bearing an activating PIK3CA (phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha, PI(3)K alpha) mutation. The patient was treated with the PI(3)K alpha inhibitor BYL719, which achieved a lasting clinical response, but the patient eventually became resistant to this drug (emergence of lung metastases) and died shortly thereafter. A rapid autopsy was performed and material from a total of 14 metastatic sites was collected and sequenced. All metastatic lesions, when compared to the pre-treatment tumour, had a copy loss of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) and those lesions that became refractory to BYL719 had additional and different PTEN genetic alterations, resulting in the loss of PTEN expression. To put these results in context, we examined six other patients also treated with BYL719. Acquired bi-allelic loss of PTEN was found in one of these patients, whereas in two others PIK3CA mutations present in the primary tumour were no longer detected at the time of progression. To characterize our findings functionally, we examined the effects of PTEN knockdown in several preclinical models (both in cell lines intrinsically sensitive to BYL719 and in PTEN-null xenografts derived from our index patient), which we found resulted in resistance to BYL719, whereas simultaneous PI(3) K p110 beta blockade reverted this resistance phenotype. We conclude that parallel genetic evolution of separate metastatic sites with different PTEN genomic alterations leads to a convergent PTEN-null phenotype resistant to PI(3)K alpha inhibition.","[Juric, Dejan; Huynh, Tiffany; Mino-Kenudson, Mari; Sgroi, Dennis; Isakoff, Steven; Thabet, Ashraf; Elamine, Leila] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Canc, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Castel, Pau; Won, Helen H.; Ellis, Haley; Iyer, Gopa; Shah, Ronak H.; Solit, David B.; Berger, Michael F.; Baselga, Jose; Scaltriti, Maurizio] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Human Oncol & Pathogenesis Program HOPP, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Griffith, Malachi; Mardis, Elaine R.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Griffith, Malachi; Griffith, Obi L.; Mardis, Elaine R.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Siteman Canc Ctr, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Griffith, Malachi; Griffith, Obi L.; Ainscough, Benjamin J.; Ramu, Avinash; Mardis, Elaine R.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Genome Inst, St Louis, MO 63108 USA; [Griffith, Obi L.; Mardis, Elaine R.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Won, Helen H.; Berger, Michael F.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Ebbesen, Saya H.; Lowe, ScottW.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Canc Biol & Genet Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Iyer, Gopa; Solit, David B.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Med, Div Genitourinary Oncol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Lowe, ScottW.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Canc Biol & Genet Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Quadt, Cornelia; Peters, Malte] Novartis Pharma AG, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; [Derti, Adnan; Schegel, Robert; Huang, Alan] Novartis Inst BioMed Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Baselga, Jose] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Med, Breast Med Serv, New York, NY 10065 USA","Scaltriti, M (reprint author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Human Oncol & Pathogenesis Program HOPP, 1275 York Ave,Box 20, New York, NY 10065 USA.",bergerm1@mskcc.org; baselgaj@mskcc.org; scaltrim@mskcc.org,"Shah, Ronak/H-9726-2017","Shah, Ronak/0000-0001-9042-6213; Griffith, Malachi/0000-0002-6388-446X",Stand Up to Cancer Dream Team Translational Research Grant; Entertainment Industry Foundation [SU2C-AACR-DT0209]; Breast Cancer Research Foundation; Geoffrey Beene Cancer Research Center; Starr Cancer Consortium; MMHCC [CA105388]; National Institutes of Health [T32 CA-71345-15],"We thank members of the MSKCC Diagnostic Molecular Pathology Laboratory and the MSK Maria-Josee and Henry Kravis Center for Molecular Oncology for assistance with sequencing.

Folding has been shown to rely on apical constriction(2-7). The resulting cell-shape changes depend either on adherens junction basal shift(2) or on a redistribution of myosin II3-5,7, which could be driven by mechanical signals(8). Yet the initial cellular mechanisms that trigger and coordinate cell remodelling remain largely unknown. Here we unravel the active role of apoptotic cells in initiating morphogenesis, thus revealing a novel mechanism of epithelium folding. We show that, in a live developing tissue, apoptotic cells exert a transient pulling force upon the apical surface of the epithelium through a highly dynamic apico-basal myosin II cable. The apoptotic cells then induce a non-autonomous increase in tissue tension together with cortical myosin II apical stabilization in the surrounding tissue, eventually resulting in epithelium folding. Together our results, supported by a theoretical biophysical three-dimensional model, identify an apoptotic myosin-II-dependent signal as the initial signal leading to cell reorganization and tissue folding. This work further reveals that, far from being passively eliminated as generally assumed ( for example, during digit individualization(9)), apoptotic cells actively influence their surroundings and trigger tissue remodelling through regulation of tissue tension.","[Monier, Bruno; Gettings, Melanie; Mangeat, Thomas; Schott, Sonia; Suzanne, Magali] Univ Toulouse, UPS, LBCMCP, F-31062 Toulouse, France; [Monier, Bruno; Gettings, Melanie; Mangeat, Thomas; Schott, Sonia; Suzanne, Magali] CNRS, LBCMCP, F-31062 Toulouse, France; [Gay, Guillaume] DamCB, Data Anal & Modelling Cell Biol, F-13005 Marseille, France; [Guarner, Ana] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Ctr Biol Mol Severo Ochoa CSIC UAM, E-28049 Madrid, Spain","Suzanne, M (reprint author), Univ Toulouse, UPS, LBCMCP, F-31062 Toulouse, France.",guillaume@damcb.com; magali.suzanne@univ-tlse3.fr,,,Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR); Fondation de la Recherche et de l'Innovation Therapeutique en Cancerologie (RITC); University of Toulouse,"We thank C.

Here we show that the DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX21 can sense the transcriptional status of both RNA polymerase (Pol) I and II to control multiple steps of ribosome biogenesis in human cells. We demonstrate that DDX21 widely associates with Pol I-and Pol II-transcribed genes and with diverse species of RNA, most prominently with non-coding RNAs involved in the formation of ribonucleoprotein complexes, including ribosomal RNA, small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) and 7SK RNA. Although broad, these molecular interactions, both at the chromatin and RNA level, exhibit remarkable specificity for the regulation of ribosomal genes. In the nucleolus, DDX21 occupies the transcribed rDNA locus, directly contacts both rRNA and snoRNAs, and promotes rRNA transcription, processing and modification. In the nucleoplasm, DDX21 binds 7SK RNA and, as a component of the 7SK small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex, is recruited to the promoters of Pol II-transcribed genes encoding ribosomal proteins and snoRNAs. Promoter-bound DDX21 facilitates the release of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) from the 7SK snRNP in a manner that is dependent on its helicase activity, thereby promoting transcription of its target genes. Our results uncover the multifaceted role of DDX21 in multiple steps of ribosome biogenesis, and provide evidence implicating a mammalian RNA helicase in RNA modification and Pol II elongation control.","[Calo, Eliezer; Wysocka, Joanna] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Chem & Syst Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Flynn, Ryan A.; Martin, Lance; Spitale, Robert C.; Chang, Howard Y.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Flynn, Ryan A.; Martin, Lance; Spitale, Robert C.; Chang, Howard Y.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Program Epithelial Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Wysocka, Joanna] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Dev Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Wysocka, J (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Chem & Syst Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",howchang@stanford.edu; wysocka@stanford.edu,,"Flynn, Ryan/0000-0001-5013-0442","Stanford Medical Scientist Training Program; AP Giannini Foundation; National Institutes of Health [R01-HG004361, R01-ES023168, P50-HG007735, R01-GM095555]; W.

This error-prone repair pathway is triggered upon telomere de-protection to promote the formation of deleterious chromosome end-to-end fusions(1-3). Using next-generation sequencing technology, here we show that repair by alternative NHEJ yields non-TTAGGG nucleotide insertions at fusion breakpoints of dysfunctional telomeres. Investigating the enzymatic activity responsible for the random insertions enabled us to identify polymerase theta (Pol theta; encoded by Polq in mice) as a crucial alternative NHEJ factor in mammalian cells. Polq inhibition suppresses alternative NHEJ at dysfunctional telomeres, and hinders chromosomal translocations at non-telomeric loci. In addition, we found that loss of Polq in mice results in increased rates of homology-directed repair, evident by recombination of dysfunctional telomeres and accumulation of RAD51 at double-stranded breaks. Lastly, we show that depletion of Pol theta has a synergistic effect on cell survival in the absence of BRCA genes, suggesting that the inhibition of this mutagenic polymerase represents a valid therapeutic avenue for tumours carrying mutations in homology-directed repair genes.","[Mateos-Gomez, Pedro A.; Sfeir, Agnel] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Skirball Inst Biomol Med, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Gong, Fade; Miller, Kyle M.] Univ Texas Austin, Inst Cellular & Mol Biol, Dept Mol Biosci, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Nair, Nidhi; Lazzerini-Denchi, Eros] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol & Expt Med, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Sfeir, A (reprint author), NYU, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Skirball Inst Biomol Med, New York, NY 10016 USA.",agnel.sfeir@med.nyu.edu,"lazzerini denchi, eros/F-7913-2010; Gong, Fade/M-1585-2015","lazzerini denchi, eros/0000-0001-5378-4644; Miller, Kyle/0000-0002-4544-0013",Breast Cancer Alliance; V-foundation; Department of Defense Breast Cancer Research Program [BC134020]; Pew-Stewart Scholars Award; Pew Scholars Award; Novartis Advanced Discovery Institute; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [AG038677]; Helen L. and Martin S.

Loss of HR accounts for the genomic instability of EOCs and for their cellular hyper-dependence on alternative poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP)-mediated DNA repair mechanisms(2-5). Previous studies have implicated the DNA polymerase theta (Pol theta also known as POLQ, encoded by POLQ) 6 in a pathway required for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks(7-9), referred to as the error-prone microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ) pathway(10-13). Whether Pol theta interacts with canonical DNA repair pathways to prevent genomic instability remains unknown. Here we report an inverse correlation between HR activity and Pol theta expression in EOCs. Knockdown of Pol theta in HR-proficient cells upregulates HR activity and RAD51 nucleofilament assembly, while knockdown of Pol theta in HR-deficient EOCs enhances cell death. Consistent with these results, genetic inactivation of an HR gene (Fancd2) and Polq in mice results in embryonic lethality. Moreover, Pol theta contains RAD51 binding motifs and it blocks RAD51-mediated recombination. Our results reveal a synthetic lethal relationship between the HR pathway and Pol theta-mediated repair in EOCs, and identify Pol theta as a novel druggable target for cancer therapy.","[Ceccaldi, Raphael; Liu, Jessica C.; Primack, Benjamin; O'Connor, Kevin W.; Yusufzai, Timur; D'Andrea, Alan D.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Radiat Oncol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Liu, Jessica C.; Yusufzai, Timur] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem & Mol Pharmacol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Liu, Jessica C.] Harvard Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Amunugama, Ravindra] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biol Chem & Mol Pharmacol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Hajdu, Ildiko; Elledge, Stephen J.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Div Genet, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Petalcorin, Mark I.

However, palaeoclimate data have thus far been insufficient to provide a conclusive test of this prediction. Here we present atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) reconstructions based on multi-site boron-isotope records from the late Pliocene epoch (3.3 to 2.3 million years ago). We find that Earth's climate sensitivity to CO2-based radiative forcing (Earth system sensitivity) was half as strong during the warm Pliocene as during the cold late Pleistocene epoch (0.8 to 0.01 million years ago). Weattribute this difference to the radiative impacts of continental ice-volume changes (the ice-albedo feedback) during the late Pleistocene, because equilibrium climate sensitivity is identical for the two intervals when we account for such impacts using sea-level reconstructions. We conclude that, on a global scale, no unexpected climate feedbacks operated during the warm Pliocene, and that predictions of equilibrium climate sensitivity (excludinglong-termice-albedo feedbacks) forour Pliocene-like future(with CO2 levels up to maximum Pliocene levels of 450 parts per million) are well described by the currently accepted range of an increase of 1.5 K to 4.5 K per doubling of CO2.","[Martinez-Boti, M.

Existing biocontainment methods are insufficient because they impose evolutionary pressure on the organism to eject the safeguard by spontaneous mutagenesis or horizontal gene transfer, or because they can be circumvented by environmentally available compounds. Here we computationally redesign essential enzymes in the first organism possessing an altered genetic code (Escherichia coli strain C321.Delta A) to confer metabolic dependence on non-standard amino acids for survival. The resulting GMOs cannot metabolically bypass their biocontainment mechanisms using known environmental compounds, and they exhibit unprecedented resistance to evolutionary escape through mutagenesis and horizontal gene transfer.

Here we report structures of ATP- and ADP-bound NSF, and the NSF/SNAP/SNARE (20S) supercomplex determined by single-particle electron cryomicroscopy at nearatomic to sub-nanometre resolution without imposing symmetry. Large, potentially force-generating, conformational differences exist between ATP- and ADP-bound NSF. The 20S supercomplex exhibits broken symmetry, transitioning fromsix-fold symmetry of the NSF ATPase domains to pseudo four-fold symmetry of the SNARE complex. SNAPs interact with the SNARE complex with an opposite structural twist, suggesting an unwinding mechanism.

Crystallographic studies of a glutamate transporter homologue from the archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii, Glt(Ph), showed that distinct transport domains translocate substrates into the cytoplasm by moving across the membrane within a central trimerization scaffold. Here we report direct observations of these 'elevator-like' transport domain motions in the context of reconstituted proteoliposomes and physiological ion gradients using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) imaging. We show that GltPh bearing two mutations introduced to impart characteristics of the human transporter exhibits markedly increased transport domain dynamics, which parallels an increased rate of substrate transport, thereby establishing a direct temporal relationship between transport domain motion and substrate uptake. Crystallographic and computational investigations corroborated these findings by revealing that the 'humanizing' mutations favour structurally 'unlocked' intermediate states in the transport cycle exhibiting increased solvent occupancy at the interface between the transport domain and the trimeric scaffold.","[Akyuz, Nurunisa; Zhou, Zhou; Stolzenberg, Sebastian; Cuendet, Michel A.; Khelashvili, George; Altman, Roger B.; Terry, Daniel S.; Weinstein, Harel; Boudker, Olga; Blanchard, Scott C.] Cornell Univ, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Weill Cornell Med Coll, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Georgieva, Elka R.; Freed, Jack H.] Cornell Univ, Natl Biomed Ctr Adv ESR Technol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Georgieva, Elka R.; Freed, Jack H.] Cornell Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Cuendet, Michel A.] Swiss Inst Bioinformat, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Weinstein, Harel] Cornell Univ, HRH Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz Alsau, Weill Cornell Med Coll, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Blanchard, Scott C.] Triinst Training Program Chem Biol, New York, NY 10065 USA","Blanchard, SC (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Weill Cornell Med Coll, 1300 York Ave, New York, NY 10065 USA.",olb2003@med.cornell.edu; scb2005@med.cornell.edu,"Blanchard, Scott/A-5804-2009","Blanchard, Scott/0000-0003-2717-9365; Terry, Daniel/0000-0001-9021-0084; Akyuz, Nurunisa/0000-0002-6340-1915","Office of Science of the US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; National Institute of Health [5U54GM087519, P01DA012408, R01GM098859, R21MH099491, P41GM103521, R010EB003150]","The authors would like to thank P.

Their optical variability is stochastic and can be due to a variety of physical mechanisms; it is also well-described statistically in terms of a damped random walk model(1). The recent availability of large collections of astronomical timeseries of flux measurements (light curves(2-5)) offers new data sets for a systematic exploration of quasar variability. Here we report the detection of a strong, smooth periodic signal in the optical variability of the quasar PG 1302-102 with a mean observed period of 1,884 +/- 88 days. It was identified in a search for periodic variability in a data set of light curves for 247,000 known, spectroscopically confirmed quasars with a temporal baseline of about 9 years. Although the interpretation of this phenomenon is still uncertain, the most plausible mechanisms involve a binary system of two supermassive black holes with a subparsec separation.

This has been driven by the low strength-to-weight ratio (specific strength) of iron and steel, and the desire to improve such mechanical properties with other materials. Recently, high-aluminium low-density steels have been actively studied as a means of increasing the specific strength of an alloy by reducing its density(3-5). But with increasing aluminium content a problem is encountered: brittle intermetallic compounds can formin the resulting alloys, leading to poor ductility. Here we show that an FeAl-type brittle but hard intermetallic compound (B2) can be effectively used as a strengthening second phase in high-aluminiumlow-density steel, while alleviating its harmful effect on ductility by controlling its morphology and dispersion. The specific tensile strength and ductility of the developed steel improve on those of the lightest and strongest metallic materials known, titanium alloys. We found that alloying of nickel catalyses the precipitation of nanometre-sized B2 particles in the face-centred cubic matrix of high-aluminiumlow-density steel during heat treatment of cold-rolled sheet steel. Our results demonstrate how intermetallic compounds can be harnessed in the alloy design of lightweight steels for structural applications and others.","[Kim, Sang-Heon; Kim, Hansoo; Kim, Nack J.] POSTECH, Grad Inst Ferrous Technol, Pohang 790784, South Korea","Kim, H (reprint author), POSTECH, Grad Inst Ferrous Technol, Pohang 790784, South Korea.",hansoo-kim@postech.ac.kr,,,Steel Innovation Program of POSCO,We thank J.-S.

Many of the methods now used to construct heteroaromatic C-Si bonds involve stoichiometric reactions between heteroaryl organometallic species and silicon electrophiles(6,7) or direct, transition metal-catalysed intermolecular carbon-hydrogen (C-H) silylation using rhodium or iridium complexes in the presence of excess hydrogen acceptors(8,9). Both approaches are useful, but their limitations include functional group in compatibility, narrow scope of application, high cost and low availability of the catalysts, and unproven scalability. For this reason, a new and general catalytic approach to heteroaromatic C-Si bond construction that avoids such limitations is highly desirable. Here we report an example of cross-dehydrogenative heteroaromatic C-H functionalization catalysed by an Earth-abundant alkali metal species. We found that readily available and inexpensive potassium tert-butoxide catalyses the direct silylation of aromatic heterocycles with hydrosilanes, furnishing heteroarylsilanes in a single step. The silylation proceeds under mild conditions, in the absence of hydrogen acceptors, ligands or additives, and is scalable to greater than 100 grams under optionally solvent-free conditions. Substrate classes that are difficult to activate with precious metal catalysts are silylated in good yield and with excellent regioselectivity. The derived heteroarylsilane products readily engage in versatile transformations enabling new synthetic strategies for heteroaromatic elaboration, and are useful in their own right in pharmaceutical and materials science applications.","[Toutov, Anton A.; Liu, Wen-Bo; Betz, Kerry N.; Fedorov, Alexey; Stoltz, Brian M.; Grubbs, Robert H.] CALTECH, Div Chem & Chem Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Grubbs, RH (reprint author), CALTECH, Div Chem & Chem Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",stoltz@caltech.edu; rhg@caltech.edu,"Fedorov, Alexey/B-2708-2008; LIU, WEN-BO/D-7401-2012","Fedorov, Alexey/0000-0001-9814-6726; Morton, Daniel/0000-0002-5007-2227","NSF under the CCI Center for Selective C-H Functionalization [CHE-1205646, CHE-1212767]; BP under the XC2 initiative; Resnick Sustainability Institute at Caltech; Dow Chemical; NSERC; Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry (SIOC)","This work was supported by the NSF under the CCI Center for Selective C-H Functionalization (CHE-1205646) and under CHE-1212767, and by BP under the XC<SUP>2</SUP> initiative.

But it is not clear what happens at the base of the plates, the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB). The LAB has been well imaged with converted teleseismic waves(1,2), whose 10-40-kilometre wavelength controls the structural resolution. Here we use explosion-generated seismic waves (of about 0.5-kilometre wavelength) to form a high-resolution image for the base of an oceanic plate that is subducting beneath North Island, New Zealand. Our 80-kilometre-wide image is based on P-wave reflections and shows an approximately 15 degrees dipping, abrupt, seismic wave-speed transition (less than 1 kilometre thick) at a depth of about 100 kilometres. The boundary is parallel to the top of the plate and seismic attributes indicate a P-wave speed decrease of at least 8 +/- 3 per cent across it. A parallel reflection event approximately 10 kilometres deeper shows that the decrease in P-wave speed is confined to a channel at the base of the plate, which we interpret as a sheared zone of ponded partial melts or volatiles. This is independent, high-resolution evidence for a low-viscosity channel at the LAB that decouples plates from mantle flow beneath, and allows plate tectonics to work.","[Stern, T. A.; Savage, M.

Genetic isolation and intrinsic biocontainment would provide essential biosafety measures to secure these closed systems and enable safe applications of GMOs in open systems(2,3), which include bioremediation(4) and probiotics(5). Although safeguards have been designed to control cell growth by essential gene regulation(6), inducible toxin switches(7) and engineered auxotrophies8, these approaches are compromised by cross-feeding of essential metabolites, leaked expression of essential genes, or genetic mutations(9,10). Here we describe the construction of a series of genomically recoded organisms (GROs)(11) whose growth is restricted by the expression of multiple essential genes that depend on exogenously supplied synthetic aminoacids (sAAs). We introduced a Methanocaldococcus jannaschii tRNA: aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase pair into the chromosome of a GRO derived from Escherichia coli that lacks all TAG codons and release factor 1, endowing this organism with the orthogonal translational components to convert TAG into a dedicated sense codon for sAAs. Using multiplex automated genome engineering(12), we introduced in-frame TAG codons into 22 essential genes, linking their expression to the incorporation of synthetic phenylalanine-derived amino acids. Of the 60 sAA-dependent variants isolated, a notable strain harbouring three TAG codons inconserved functional residues(13) of MurG, DnaA and SerS and containing targeted tRNA deletions maintained robust growth and exhibited undetectable escape frequencies upon culturing similar to 10(11) cells on solid media for 7 days or in liquid media for 20 days. This is a significant improvement over existing biocontainment approaches(2,3,6-10). We constructed synthetic auxotrophs dependent on sAAs that were not rescued by cross-feeding in environmental growth assays. These auxotrophic GROs possess alternative genetic codes that impart genetic isolation by impeding horizontal gene transfer(11) and now depend on the use of synthetic biochemical building blocks, advancing orthogonal barriers between engineered organisms and the environment.","[Rovner, Alexis J.; Haimovich, Adrian D.; Katz, Spencer R.; Li, Zhe; Grome, Michael W.; Amiram, Miriam; Patel, Jaymin R.; Gallagher, Ryan R.; Isaacs, Farren J.] Yale Univ, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Rovner, Alexis J.; Haimovich, Adrian D.; Katz, Spencer R.; Li, Zhe; Grome, Michael W.; Gassaway, Brandon M.; Amiram, Miriam; Patel, Jaymin R.; Gallagher, Ryan R.; Rinehart, Jesse; Isaacs, Farren J.] Yale Univ, Syst Biol Inst, West Haven, CT 06516 USA; [Rinehart, Jesse] Yale Univ, Dept Cellular & Mol Physiol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Isaacs, FJ (reprint author), Yale Univ, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",farren.isaacs@yale.edu,,"Katz, Spencer/0000-0002-5586-3562; Gassaway, Brandon/0000-0002-6102-2356","Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency [N66001-12-C-4020, N66001-12-C-4211]; DuPont Inc.; Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation;  [NIH-MSTP-TG-T32GM07205]","We are grateful to D.

Conditions under which reefs bounce back from bleaching events or shift from coral to algal dominance are unknown, making it difficult to predict and plan for differing reef responses under climate change(2). Herewe document and predict long-term reef responses to a major climate-induced coral bleaching event that caused unprecedented region-wide mortality of Indo-Pacific corals. Following loss of >90% live coral cover, 12 of 21 reefs recovered towards pre-disturbance live coral states, while nine reefs underwent regime shifts to fleshy macroalgae. Functional diversity of associated reef fish communities shifted substantially following bleaching, returning towards pre-disturbance structure on recovering reefs, while becoming progressively altered on regime shifting reefs. We identified threshold values for a range of factors that accurately predicted ecosystem response to the bleaching event. Recovery was favoured when reefs were structurally complex and in deeper water, when density of juvenile corals and herbivorous fishes was relatively high and when nutrient loads were low. Whether reefs were inside no-take marine reserves had no bearing on ecosystem trajectory. Although conditions governing regime shift or recovery dynamics were diverse, pre-disturbance quantification of simple factors such as structural complexity and water depth accurately predicted ecosystem trajectories. These findings foreshadow the likely divergent but predictable outcomes for reef ecosystems in response to climate change, thus guiding improved management and adaptation.","[Graham, Nicholas A.

Although documented instances of horizontal gene transfer from bacteria to eukaryotes remain rare, bacteria represent a rich source of new functions potentially available for co-option(2). One benefit that genes of bacterial origin could provide to eukaryotes is the capacity to produce antibacterials, which have evolved in prokaryotes as the result of eons of interbacterial competition. The type VI secretion amidase effector (Tae) proteins are potent bacteriocidal enzymes that degrade the cell wall when delivered into competing bacterial cells by the type VI secretion system(3). Here we show that tae genes have been transferred to eukaryotes on at least six occasions, and that the resulting domesticated amidase effector (dae) genes have been preserved for hundreds of millions of years through purifying selection. We show that the dae genes acquired eukaryotic secretion signals, are expressed within recipient organisms, and encode active antibacterial toxins that possess substrate specificity matching extant Tae proteins of the same lineage. Finally, we show that a dae gene in the deer tick Ixodes scapularis limits proliferation of Borrelia burgdorferi, the aetiologic agent of Lyme disease. Our work demonstrates that a family of horizontally acquired toxins honed to mediate interbacterial antagonism confers previously undescribed antibacterial capacity to eukaryotes. We speculate that the selective pressure imposed by competition between bacteria has produced a reservoir of genes encoding diverse antimicrobial functions that are tailored for co-option by eukaryotic innate immune systems.","[Chou, Seemay; Peterson, S.

When MI occurs early in life, genetic inheritance is a major component to risk(1). Previously, rare mutations in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) genes have been shown to contribute to MI risk inindividual families(3-8), whereas common variants at more than 45 loci have been associated with MI risk in the population(9-15). Here we evaluate how rare mutations contribute to early-onset MI risk in the population. We sequenced the protein-coding regions of 9,793 genomes from patients with MI at an early age (<= 50 years inmales and <= 60 years in females) along with MI-free controls. We identified two genes in which rare coding-sequence mutations were more frequent in MI cases versus controls at exome-wide significance. At low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), carriers of rare non-synonymous mutations were at 4.2-fold increased risk for MI; carriers of null alleles at LDLR were at even higher risk (13-fold difference). Approximately 2% of early MI cases harbour a rare, damaging mutation in LDLR; this estimate is similar to one made more than 40 years ago using an analysis of total cholesterol(16). Among controls, about 1 in 217 carried an LDLR coding-sequence mutation and had plasma LDL cholesterol > 190 mg dl(-1). At apolipoprotein A-V (APOA5), carriers of rare non-synonymous mutations were at 2.2-fold increased risk for MI. When compared with non-carriers, LDLR mutation carriers had higher plasma LDL cholesterol, whereas APOA5 mutation carriers had higher plasma triglycerides. Recent evidence has connected MI risk with coding-sequence mutations at two genes functionally related to APOA5, namely lipoprotein lipase(15,17) and apolipoprotein C-III (refs 18, 19). Combined, these observations suggest that, as well as LDL cholesterol, disordered metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins contributes to MI risk.","[Do, Ron; Won, Hong-Hee; Peloso, Gina M.; Altshuler, David; Kathiresan, Sekar] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Human Genet Res, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Do, Ron; Won, Hong-Hee; Peloso, Gina M.; Kathiresan, Sekar] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Cardiovasc Res Ctr, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Do, Ron; Won, Hong-Hee; Peloso, Gina M.; Kathiresan, Sekar] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Do, Ron; Won, Hong-Hee; Kiezun, Adam; Zuk, Or; Peloso, Gina M.; Farlow, Deborah N.; DePristo, Mark A.; Hechter, Eliana; Folsom, Aaron R.; Lander, Eric S.; Sunyaev, Shamil R.; Altshuler, David; Gabriel, Stacey; Kathiresan, Sekar] Broad Inst, Cambridge Ctr 7, Program Med & Populat Genet, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Stitziel, Nathan O.; Cresci, Sharon] Washington Univ, Div Cardiovasc, Dept Med, Sch Med, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Stitziel, Nathan O.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Div Stat Genom, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Jorgensen, Anders Berg; Tybjaerg-Hansen, Anne] Copenhagen Univ Hosp, Rigshosp, Mol Genet Sect, Dept Clin Biochem KB3011, DK-1165 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Jorgensen, Anders Berg; Tybjaerg-Hansen, Anne] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Hlth Sci, DK-1165 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Duga, Stefano; Guella, Illaria; Asselta, Rosanna] Univ Milan, Dipartimento Biotecnol Med & Med Traslaz, I-20122 Milan, Italy; [Merlini, Pier Angelica] Osped Niguarda Ca Granda, Div Cardiol, I-20162 Milan, Italy; [Farrall, Martin; Goel, Anuj; Watkins, Hugh] Univ Oxford, Wellcome Trust Ctr Human Genet, Dept Cardiovasc Med, Oxford OX1 2J, England; [Lange, Leslie A.; Lange, Ethan M.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Genet, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Auer, Paul L.; Folsom, Aaron R.; Reiner, Alex P.; Carlson, Christopher S.; Kooperberg, Charles; Schwartz, Stephen M.] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Div Publ Hlth Sci, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Girelli, Domenico; Martinelli, Nicola; Olivieri, Oliviero] Univ Verona, Dept Med, Sch Med, I-37129 Verona, Italy; [Roberts, Robert; Stewart, Alexander F.

As such, microRNAs are critical cogs innumerous biological processes(1,2), and dysregulated microRNA expression is correlated with many human diseases. Certain microRNAs, called oncomiRs, play a causal role in the onset and maintenance of cancer when overexpressed. Tumours that depend on these microRNAs are said to display oncomiR addiction(3-5). Some of the most effective anticancer therapies target oncogenes such as EGFR and HER2; similarly, inhibition of oncomiRs using antisense oligomers (that is, antimiRs) is an evolving therapeutic strategy(6,7). However, the in vivo efficacy of current antimiR technologies is hindered by physiological and cellular barriers to delivery into targeted cells(8). Here we introduce a novel antimiR delivery platform that targets the acidic tumour microenvironment, evades systemic clearance by the liver, and facilitates cell entry via a non-endocytic pathway. We find that the attachment of peptide nucleic acid antimiRs to a peptide with a low pH-induced transmembrane structure (pHLIP) produces a novel construct that could target the tumour microenvironment, transport antimiRs across plasma membranes under acidic conditions such as those found in solid tumours (pH approximately 6), and effectively inhibit the miR-155 oncomiR in a mouse model of lymphoma. This study introduces a new model for using antimiRs as anti-cancer drugs, which can have broad impacts on the field of targeted drug delivery.","[Cheng, Christopher J.; Babar, Imran A.; Pincus, Zachary; Liu, Connie; Slack, Frank J.] Yale Univ, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Cheng, Christopher J.; Saltzman, W.

For many organelles, however, the precise connection between position and function has remainedunclear, because strategies to control intracellular organelle positioning with spatiotemporal precision are lacking. Here we establish optical control of intracellular transport by using light-sensitive heterodimerization to recruit specific cytoskeletal motor proteins (kinesin, dynein or myosin) to selected cargoes. We demonstrate that the motility of peroxisomes, recycling endosomes and mitochondria can be locally and repeatedly induced or stopped, allowing rapid organelle repositioning. We applied this approach in primary rat hippocampal neurons to test how local positioning of recycling endosomes contributes to axon outgrowth and found that dynein-driven removal of endosomes from axonal growth cones reversibly suppressed axon growth, whereas kinesin-driven endosome enrichment enhanced growth. Our strategy for optogenetic control of organelle positioning will be widely applicable to explore site-specific organelle functions in different model systems.","[van Bergeijk, Petra; Adrian, Max; Hoogenraad, Casper C.; Kapitein, Lukas C.] Univ Utrecht, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, NL-3584 CH Utrecht, Netherlands","Hoogenraad, CC (reprint author), Univ Utrecht, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, NL-3584 CH Utrecht, Netherlands.",c.hoogenraad@uu.nl; l.kapitein@uu.nl,"Kapitein, Lukas/J-4776-2016","Kapitein, Lukas/0000-0001-9418-6739; Adrian, Max/0000-0002-4926-1258",Dutch Technology Foundation STW part of the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO); Foundation for Fundamental Research on Matter (FOM) part of the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO); NWO (NWO-ALW-VICI); NWO (NWO-ALW-VIDI); European Research Council (ERC starting grant),"We are grateful to C.

In eukaryotes and Gram-negative bacteria, the primary thiol is glutathione (GSH), a cysteinyl-containing tripeptide. In contrast, mycothiol(MSH), a cysteinyl pseudo-disaccharide, is dominant in Gram-positive actinobacteria, including antibiotic-producing actinomycetes and pathogenic mycobacteria. MSH is equivalent to GSH, either as a cofactor or as a substrate, in numerous biochemical processes(4), most of which have not been characterized, largely due to the dearth of information concerning MSH-dependent proteins. Actinomycetes are able to produce another thiol, ergothioneine (EGT), a histidine betaine derivative that is widely assimilated by plants and animals for variable physiological activities(5). The involvement of EGT in enzymatic reactions, however, lacks any precedent. Here we report that the unprecedented coupling of two bacterial thiols, MSH and EGT, has a constructive role in the biosynthesis of lincomycin A, a sulfur-containing lincosamide (C8 sugar) antibiotic that has been widely used for half a century to treat Gram-positive bacterial infections(6-9). EGT acts as a carrier to template the molecular assembly, and MSH is the sulfur donor for lincomycin maturation after thiol exchange. These thiols function through two unusual S-glycosylations that program lincosamide transfer, activation and modification, providing the first paradigm for EGT-associated biochemical processes and for the poorly understood MSH-dependent biotransformations, a newly described model that is potentially common in the incorporation of sulfur, an element essential for life and ubiquitous in living systems.","[Zhao, Qunfei; Wang, Min; Xu, Dongxiao; Liu, Wen] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Organ Chem, State Key Lab Bioorgan & Nat Prod Chem, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qinglin; Liu, Wen] Huzhou Ctr Biosynthet Innovat, Huzhou 313000, Peoples R China","Liu, W (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Organ Chem, State Key Lab Bioorgan & Nat Prod Chem, 345 Lingling Rd, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China.",wliu@mail.sioc.ac.cn,,"Wang, Min/0000-0002-4060-1375","NSFC [81302674, 31430005, 91213303, 21472231, 91413101]; STCSM [14JC1407700, 13XD1404500]; MST of China [2012AA02A706]","This work was supported in part by grants from NSFC (81302674, 31430005, 91213303, 21472231 and 91413101), STCSM (14JC1407700 and 13XD1404500) and MST (2012AA02A706) of China.",,35,31,38,8,108,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,5-Feb,2015,518,7537,,,,,115,+,,10.1038/nature14137,,19,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,CA7LE,WOS:000349098000043,25607359,No,,,11/20/17

Defective mutations in several of these enzymes have been linked to serious metabolic diseases in humans, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase is a target for drug discovery in the treatment of diabetes, cancer and other diseases(7-9). Here we report the identification and biochemical, structural and functional characterizations of a novel single-chain (120 kDa), multi-domain biotin-dependent carboxylase in bacteria. It has preference for long-chain acyl-CoA substrates, although it is also active towards short-chain and medium-chainacyl-CoAs, and we have named it long-chain acyl-CoA carboxylase. The holoenzyme is a homo-hexamer with molecular mass of 720 kDa. The 3.0 angstrom crystal structure of the long-chain acyl-CoA carboxylase holoenzyme from Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis revealed an architecture that is strikingly different from those of related biotin-dependent carboxylases(10,11). In addition, the domains of each monomer have no direct contact with each other. They are instead extensively swapped in the holoenzyme, such that one cycle of catalysis involves the participation of four monomers. Functional studies in Pseudomonas aeruginosa suggest that the enzyme is involved in the utilization of selected carbon and nitrogen sources.","[Tran, Timothy H.; Jo, Jeanyoung; Chou, Chi-Yuan; Dietrich, Lars E.

Using a multiple regression approach that is physically motivated by surface energy balance, we isolate the impact of radiative forcing, climate feedback and ocean heat uptake on GMST-with the regression residual interpreted as internal variability-and assess all possible 15- and 62-year trends. The differences between simulated and observed trends are dominated by random internal variability over the shorter timescale and by variations in the radiative forcings used to drive models over the longer timescale. For either trend length, spread in simulated climate feedback leaves no traceable imprint on GMST trends or, consequently, on the difference between simulations and observations. The claim that climate models systematically overestimate the response to radiative forcing from increasing greenhouse gas concentrations therefore seems to be unfounded.","[Marotzke, Jochem] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Forster, Piers M.] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England","Marotzke, J (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Bundesstr 53, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",jochem.marotzke@mpimet.mpg.de,"Forster, Piers/F-9829-2010","Forster, Piers/0000-0002-6078-0171",Max Planck Society for the Advancement of Science; Royal Society Wolfson Merit Award; EPSRC [EP/1014721/1],"We are indebted to J.

Secondary cell walls, such as those found in xylem, are composed of cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin and account for the bulk of plant biomass. The coordination between transcriptional regulation of synthesis for each polymer is complex and vital to cell function. A regulatory hierarchy of developmental switches has been proposed, although the full complement of regulators remains unknown. Here we present a protein-DNA network between Arabidopsis thaliana transcription factors and secondary cell wall metabolic genes with gene expression regulated by a series of feed-forward loops. This model allowed us to develop and validate new hypotheses about secondary wall gene regulation under abiotic stress. Distinct stresses are able to perturb targeted genes to potentially promote functional adaptation. These interactions will serve as a foundation for understanding the regulation of a complex, integral plant component.","[Taylor-Teeples, M.; de Lucas, M.; Turco, G.; Toal, T.

Here we show that human-papillomavirus-associated tumours are dominated by helical domain mutations of the oncogene PIK3CA, novel alterations involving loss of TRAF3, and amplification of the cell cycle gene E2F1. Smoking-related HNSCCs demonstrate near universal loss-of-function TP53 mutations and CDKN2A inactivation with frequent copy number alterations including amplification of 3q26/28 and 11q13/22. A subgroup of oral cavity tumours with favourable clinical outcomes displayed infrequent copy number alterations in conjunction with activating mutations of HRAS or PIK3CA, coupled with inactivating mutations of CASP8, NOTCH1 and TP53. Other distinct subgroups contained loss-of-function alterations of the chromatin modifier NSD1, WNT pathway genes AJUBA and FAT1, and activation of oxidative stress factor NFE2L2, mainly in laryngeal tumours.

Here we describe structure-guided engineering of a CRISPR-Cas9 complex to mediate efficient transcriptional activation at endogenous genomic loci. We used these engineered Cas9 activation complexes to investigate single-guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting rules for effective transcriptional activation, to demonstrate multiplexed activation of ten genes simultaneously, and to upregulate long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) transcripts. We also synthesized a library consisting of 70,290 guides targeting all human RefSeq coding isoforms to screen for genes that, upon activation, confer resistance to a BRAF inhibitor. The top hits included genes previously shown to be able to confer resistance, and novel candidates were validated using individual sgRNA and complementary DNA overexpression. A gene expression signature based on the top screening hits correlated with markers of BRAF inhibitor resistance in cell lines and patient-derived samples. These results collectively demonstrate the potential of Cas9-based activators as a powerful genetic perturbation technology.","[Konermann, Silvana; Brigham, Mark D.; Trevino, Alexandro E.; Joung, Julia; Abudayyeh, Omar O.; Barcena, Clea; Hsu, Patrick D.; Habib, Naomi; Gootenberg, Jonathan S.; Zhang, Feng] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Konermann, Silvana; Brigham, Mark D.; Trevino, Alexandro E.; Abudayyeh, Omar O.; Barcena, Clea; Hsu, Patrick D.; Gootenberg, Jonathan S.; Zhang, Feng] MIT, McGovern Inst Brain Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Konermann, Silvana; Brigham, Mark D.; Trevino, Alexandro E.; Abudayyeh, Omar O.; Barcena, Clea; Hsu, Patrick D.; Gootenberg, Jonathan S.; Zhang, Feng] MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Konermann, Silvana; Brigham, Mark D.; Trevino, Alexandro E.; Joung, Julia; Abudayyeh, Omar O.; Barcena, Clea; Hsu, Patrick D.; Gootenberg, Jonathan S.; Zhang, Feng] MIT, Dept Biol Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Gootenberg, Jonathan S.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Nishimasu, Hiroshi; Nureki, Osamu] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biol Sci, Tokyo 1130032, Japan; [Nishimasu, Hiroshi] JST, Tokyo 1130032, Japan","Zhang, F (reprint author), Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, 75 Ames St, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",zhang@broadinstitute.org,,"Gootenberg, Jonathan/0000-0003-2757-2175","NSF Graduate Research Fellowship; D.O.E.

The rotation rates of all cool stars decrease substantially with time as the stars steadily lose their angular momenta. If properly calibrated, rotation therefore can act as a reliable determinant of their ages based on the method of gyrochronology(2,9-11). To calibrate gyrochronology, the relationship between rotation period and age must be determined for cool stars of different masses, which is best accomplished with rotation period measurements for stars in clusters with well-known ages. Hitherto, such measurements have been possible only in clusters with ages of less than about one billion years(12-16), and gyrochronology ages for older stars have been inferred from model predictions(2,7,11,17). Here we report rotation period measurements for 30 cool stars in the 2.5-billion-year-old cluster NGC 6819. The periods reveal a well-defined relationship between rotation period and stellar mass at the cluster age, suggesting that ages with a precision of order 10 per cent can be derived for large numbers of cool Galactic field stars.","[Meibom, Soren; Latham, David W.] Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Barnes, Sydney A.] Leibniz Inst Astrophys, D-14482 Potsdam, Germany; [Barnes, Sydney A.] Space Sci Inst, Boulder, CO 80301 USA; [Platais, Imants] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Gilliland, Ronald L.] Penn State Univ, Ctr Exoplanets & Habitable Worlds, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Mathieu, Robert D.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Astron, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Meibom, S (reprint author), Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, 60 Garden St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",smeibom@cfa.harvard.edu,,,"NASA [NNX09AH18A]; NSF [1312882]; Smithsonian Institution's Competitive Grants Program for Science; German Science Foundation (DFG); Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA [NAS5-26555]; NASA Office of Space Science [NNX13AC07G]","S.M. acknowledges support through NASA grant NNX09AH18A (The Kepler ClusterStudy), NSF grant 1312882 (The Kepler ClusterStudy: Planets and Gyrochronology) and the Smithsonian Institution's Competitive Grants Program for Science in 2012 and 2013.

This is reflected in the standard model of particle physics by requiring all particles and fields to be invariant under Lorentz transformations. The best-known tests of this important cornerstone of physics are Michelson-Morley-type experiments verifying the isotropy of the speed of light(1-3). For matter, Hughes-Drever-type experiments(4-11) test whether the kinetic energy of particles is independent of the direction of their velocity, that is, whether their dispersion relations are isotropic. To provide more guidance for physics beyond the standard model, refined experimental verifications of Lorentz symmetry are desirable. Here we search for violation of Lorentz symmetry for electrons by performing an electronic analogue of a Michelson-Morley experiment. We split an electron wave packet bound inside a calcium ion into two parts with different orientations and recombine them after a time evolution of 95 milliseconds. As the Earth rotates, the absolute spatial orientation of the two parts of the wave packet changes, and anisotropies in the electron dispersion will modify the phase of the interference signal. To remove noise, we prepare a pair of calcium ions in a superposition of two decoherence-free states, thereby rejecting magnetic field fluctuations common to both ions(12). After a 23-hour measurement, we find a limit of h x 11 millihertz (h is Planck's constant) on the energy variations, verifying the isotropy of the electron's dispersion relation at the level of one part in 10(18), a 100-fold improvement on previous work(9). Alternatively, we can interpret our result as testing the rotational invariance of the Coulomb potential. Assuming that Lorentz symmetry holds for electrons and that the photon dispersion relation governs the Coulomb force, we obtain a fivefold-improved limit on anisotropies in the speed of light(2,3). Our result probes Lorentz symmetry violation at levels comparable to the ratio between the electroweak and Planck energy scales(13). Our experiment demonstrates the potential of quantum information techniques in the search for physics beyond the standard model.","[Pruttivarasin, T.; Ramm, M.; Hohensee, M.

A different strategy for modulating the interaction between a solid and a liquid uses surface corrugation, which gives rise to unique wetting behaviour(3-5). Here we show that this topographical effect can also be used to disperse particles in a wide range of solvents without recourse to chemicals to camouflage the particles' surfaces: we produce micrometre-sized particles that are coated with stiff, nanoscale spikes and exhibit long-term colloidal stability in both hydrophilic and hydrophobic media. We find that these 'hedgehog' particles do not interpenetrate each other with their spikes, which markedly decreases the contact area between the particles and, therefore, the attractive forces between them. The trapping of air in aqueous dispersions, solvent autoionization at highly developed interfaces, and long-range electrostatic repulsion in organic media also contribute to the colloidal stability of our particles. The unusual dispersion behaviour of our hedgehog particles, overturning the notion that like dissolves like, might help to mitigate adverse environmental effects of the use of surfactants and volatile organic solvents, and deepens our understanding of interparticle interactions and nanoscale colloidal chemistry.","[Bahng, Joong Hwan; Wang, Yichun; Kotov, Nicholas] Univ Michigan, Dept Biomed Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Yeom, Bongjun; Kotov, Nicholas] Univ Michigan, Dept Chem Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Tung, Siu On; Kotov, Nicholas] Univ Michigan, Macromol Sci & Engn Program, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Hoff, J.

The absence of such enzymes limits the discovery of potential medicinal candidates because nitrogen-containing groups are crucial to the biological activity of therapeutic agents and clinically useful natural products. In one prominent example illustrating the importance of incorporating nitrogen-based functionality, the conversion of the ketone of erythromycin to the -N(Me)CH2- group in azithromycin leads to a compound that can be dosed once daily with a shorter treatment time(3,4). For such reasons, synthetic chemists have sought catalysts that directly convert C-H bonds to C-N bonds. Most currently used catalysts for C-H bond amination are ill suited to the intermolecular functionalization of complex molecules because they require excess substrate or directing groups, harsh reaction conditions, weak or acidic C-H bonds, or reagents containing specialized groups on the nitrogen atom(5-14). Among C-H bond amination reactions, those forming a C-N bond at a tertiary alkyl group would be particularly valuable, because this linkage is difficult to form from ketones or alcohols that might be created in a biosynthetic pathway by oxidation(15). Here we report a mild, selective, iron-catalysed azidation of tertiary C-H bonds that occurs without excess of the valuable substrate. The reaction tolerates aqueous environments and is suitable for the functionalization of complex structures in the late stages of a multistep synthesis. Moreover, this azidation makes it possible to install a range of nitrogen-based functional groups, including those from Huisgen 'click' cycloadditions and the Staudinger ligation(16-19). We anticipate that these reactions will create opportunities to modify natural products, their precursors and their derivatives to produce analogues that contain different polarity and charge as a result of nitrogen-containing groups. It could also be used to help identify targets of biologically active molecules by creating a point of attachment for example, to fluorescent tags or 'handles' for affinity chromatography-directly on complex molecular structures.","[Sharma, Ankit; Hartwig, John F.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Hartwig, JF (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",jhartwig@berkeley.edu,,,"US NIH [4R37GM055382, S10-RR027172]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF [PBGEP2_145544]; US NIH",We thank the US NIH (4R37GM055382 to J.F.H.) and the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF; PBGEP2_145544 to AS) for financial support.

These calculations for resistivity were based on electron-phonon scattering. Here we apply self-consistent density functional theory plus dynamical meanfield theory (DFT+DMFT)(7) to iron and find that at high temperatures electron-electron scattering iscomparable to the electron-phonon scattering, bringing theory into agreement with experiments and solving the transport problem in Earth's core. The conventional thermal dynamo picture is safe. We find that electron-electron scattering of d electrons is important at high temperatures in transition metals, in contrast to textbook analyses since Mott(8,9), and that 4s electron contributions to transport are negligible, in contrast to numerous models used for over fifty years. The DFT+DMFT method should be applicable to other high-temperature systems where electron correlations are important.","[Zhang, Peng; Cohen, R.

To identify missing sequence and genetic variation, here we sequence and analyse ahaploid human genome (CHM1) using single-molecule, real-time DNA sequencing(10). We close or extend 55% of the remaining interstitial gaps in the human GRCh37 reference genome-78% of which carried long runs of degenerate short tandem repeats, often several kilobases in length, embedded within (G+C)-rich genomic regions. We resolve the complete sequence of 26,079 euchromatic structural variants at the base-pair level, including inversions, complex insertions and long tracts of tandem repeats. Most have not been previously reported, with the greatest increases in sensitivity occurring for events less than 5 kilobases in size. Compared to the human reference, we find a significant insertional bias (3: 1) in regions corresponding to complex insertions and long short tandem repeats. Our results suggest a greater complexity of the human genome in the form of variation of longer and more complex repetitive DNA that can now be largely resolved with the application of this longer-read sequencing technology.","[Chaisson, Mark J.

Here we examine the development and consequences of vascularization of the tuberculous granuloma in the zebrafish-Mycobacterium marinum infection model, which is characterized by organized granulomas with necrotic cores that bear striking resemblance to those of human tuberculosis(2). Using intravital microscopy in the transparent larval zebrafish, we show that granuloma formation is intimately associated with angiogenesis. The initiation of angiogenesis in turn coincides with the generation of local hypoxia and transcriptional induction of the canonical pro-angiogenic molecule Vegfaa. Pharmacological inhibition of the Vegf pathway suppresses granuloma-associated angiogenesis, reduces infection burden and limits dissemination. Moreover, anti-angiogenic therapies synergize with the first-line anti-tubercular antibiotic rifampicin, as well as with the antibiotic metronidazole, which targets hypoxic bacterial populations(3). Our data indicate that mycobacteria induce granuloma-associated angiogenesis, which promotes mycobacterial growth and increases spread of infection to new tissue sites. We propose the use of anti-angiogenic agents, now being used in cancer regimens, as a host-targeting tuberculosis therapy, particularly in extensively drug-resistant disease for which current antibiotic regimens are largely ineffective.","[Oehlers, Stefan H.; Cronan, Mark R.; Scott, Ninecia R.; Thomas, Monica I.; Walton, Eric M.; Beerman, Rebecca W.; Tobin, David M.] Duke Univ, Dept Mol Genet & Microbiol, Med Ctr, Ctr Microbial Pathogenesis, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Okuda, Kazuhide S.; Crosier, Philip S.] Univ Auckland, Dept Mol Med & Pathol, Auckland 1023, New Zealand","Tobin, DM (reprint author), Duke Univ, Dept Mol Genet & Microbiol, Med Ctr, Ctr Microbial Pathogenesis, Durham, NC 27710 USA.",david.tobin@duke.edu,"Okuda, Kazuhide/N-2576-2017","Scott, Ninecia/0000-0002-7847-0673; Tobin, David/0000-0003-3465-5518; Oehlers, Stefan/0000-0003-0260-672X",Australian National Health and Medical Research Council CJ Martin Early Career Fellowship; American Cancer Society Postdoctoral Fellowship [PF-13-223-01-MPC]; Duke Summer Research Opportunities Program; Malaysian Ministry of Science and Technology and Innovation scholarship; New Zealand Ministry of Science and Innovation [UOAX0813]; Duke University Center for AIDS Research (CFAR); National Institutes of Health (NIH) [5P30 AI064518]; Mallinckrodt Scholar Award; Searle Scholar Award; Vallee Foundation Young Investigator Award; NIH Director's New Innovator Award [1DP2-OD008614],"We thank D.

Mitigating therapies, aside from impractical organ transplantation, remain limited and the possibility of regenerative medicine has lacked empirical support. However, it is clinically known that patients who survive sudden, massive loss of lung tissue from necrotizing pneumonia(3,4) or acute respiratory distress syndrome(5,6) often recover full pulmonary function within six months. Correspondingly, we recently demonstrated lung regeneration in mice following H1N1 influenza virus infection, and linked distal airway stem cells expressing Trp63 (p63) and keratin 5, called DASC(p63/Krt5), to this process(7). Here we show that pre-existing, intrinsically committed DASC(p63/Krt5) undergo a proliferative expansion in response to influenza-induced lung damage, and assemble into nascent alveoli at sites of interstitial lung inflammation. We also show that the selective ablation of DASC(p63/Krt5) in vivo prevents this regeneration, leading to pre-fibrotic lesions and deficient oxygen exchange. Finally, we demonstrate that single DASC(p63/Krt5)-derived pedigrees differentiate to type I and type II pneumocytes as well as bronchiolar secretory cells following transplantation to infected lung and also minimize the structural consequences of endogenous stem cell loss on this process. The ability to propagate these cells in culture while maintaining their intrinsic lineage commitment suggests their potential in stem cell-based therapies for acute and chronic lung diseases.","[Zuo, Wei; Zhang, Ting; Wu, Daniel Zheng'An; Guan, Shou Ping; Liew, Audrey-Ann; Lim, Siew Joo; Xian, Wa; McKeon, Frank] ASTAR, Genome Inst Singapore, Singapore 138672, Singapore; [Yamamoto, Yusuke; Wang, Xia; Xian, Wa; McKeon, Frank] Jackson Lab Genom Med, Farmington, CT 06032 USA; [Vincent, Matthew] Adv Cell Technol, Marlborough, MA 01752 USA; [Lessard, Mark] Jackson Lab, Bar Harbor, ME 04609 USA; [Crum, Christopher P.; Xian, Wa] Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Xian, Wa; McKeon, Frank] Natl Univ Hlth Syst, Dept Med, Singapore 119228, Singapore; [Xian, Wa] Univ Connecticut, Dept Genet & Dev Biol, Ctr Hlth, Farmington, CT 06030 USA","McKeon, F (reprint author), ASTAR, Genome Inst Singapore, Singapore 138672, Singapore.",waxian@jax.org; mckeon.xian@gmail.com,,,"Joint Council Off ice of the Agency for Science Technology Research Agency (ASTAR), Singapore; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) [N66001-09-1-2121]; Johnson & Johnson ASTAR Joint Program; Connecticut Innovations","This work was supported by grants from the Joint Council Off ice of the Agency for Science Technology Research Agency (ASTAR), Singapore (W.X., F.M.), Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA, N66001-09-1-2121 to F.M.), the Johnson & Johnson ASTAR Joint Program (W.X., F.M.) and support from Connecticut Innovations (W.X., F.M.).

Which of these pathways applies is both organ-and injury-specific(1-4). Current models in the lung posit that epithelial repair can be attributed to cells expressing mature lineage markers(5-8). By contrast, here we define the regenerative role of previously uncharacterized, rare lineage-negative epithelial stem/progenitor (LNEP) cells present within normal distal lung. Quiescent LNEPs activate a Delta Np63 (a p63 splice variant) and cytokeratin 5 remodelling program after influenza or bleomycin injury in mice. Activated cells proliferate and migrate widely to occupy heavily injured areas depleted of mature lineages, at which point they differentiate towards mature epithelium. Lineage tracing revealed scant contribution of pre-existing mature epithelial cells in such repair, whereas orthotopic transplantation of LNEPs, isolated by a definitive surface profile identified through single-cell sequencing, directly demonstrated the proliferative capacity and multipotency of this population. LNEPs require Notch signalling to activate the DNp63 and cytokeratin 5 program, and subsequent Notch blockade promotes an alveolar cell fate. Persistent Notch signalling after injury led to parenchymal 'micro-honeycombing' (alveolar cysts), indicative of failed regeneration. Lungs from patients with fibrosis show analogous honeycomb cysts with evidence of hyperactive Notch signalling. Our findings indicate that distinct stem/progenitor cell pools repopulate injured tissue depending on the extent of the injury, and the outcomes of regeneration or fibrosis may depend in part on the dynamics of LNEP Notch signalling.","[Vaughan, Andrew E.; Brumwell, Alexis N.; Xi, Ying; Gotts, Jeffrey E.; Tan, Kevin; Tan, Victor; Liu, Feng Chun; Looney, Mark R.; Matthay, Michael A.; Chapman, Harold A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Med, Cardiovasc Res Inst, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Brownfield, Doug G.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Brownfield, Doug G.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Treutlein, Barbara] Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Anthropol, Dept Evolutionary Genet, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Rock, Jason R.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Sch Med, Dept Anat, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Vaughan, AE (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Med, Cardiovasc Res Inst, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",andrew.vaughan@ucsf.edu; hal.chapman@ucsf.edu,,"Treutlein, Barbara/0000-0002-3299-5597","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R01 HL44712, U01 HL111054]; Daiichi Pharmaceuticals;  [F32 HL117600-01]",This work was supported by National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants R01 HL44712 and U01 HL111054 and a sponsored research agreement with Daiichi Pharmaceuticals.

This strategy has proven difficult to implement therapeutically, and here we examine an alternative strategy by manipulating the p53 family members, Tp63 and Tp73 (also known as p63 and p73, respectively). The acidic transactivation-domain-bearing (TA) isoforms of p63 and p73 structurally and functionally resemble p53, whereas the Delta N isoforms (lacking the acidic transactivation domain) of p63 and p73 are frequently overexpressed in cancer and act primarily in a dominant-negative fashion against p53, TAp63 and TAp73 to inhibit their tumour-suppressive functions(3-8). The p53 family interacts extensively in cellular processes that promote tumour suppression, such as apoptosis and autophagy(9-14), thus a clear understanding of this interplay in cancer is needed to treat tumours with alterations in the p53 pathway. Here we show that deletion of the Delta N isoforms of p63 or p73 leads to metabolic reprogramming and regression of p53-deficient tumours through upregulation of IAPP, the gene that encodes amylin, a 37-amino-acid peptide co-secreted with insulin by the b cells of the pancreas. We found that IAPP is causally involved in this tumour regression and that amylin functions through the calcitonin receptor (CalcR) and receptor activity modifying protein 3 (RAMP3) to inhibit glycolysis and induce reactive oxygen species and apoptosis. Pramlintide, a synthetic analogue of amylin that is currently used to treat type 1 and type 2 diabetes, caused rapid tumour regression in p53-deficient thymic lymphomas, representing a novel strategy to target p53-deficient cancers.","[Venkatanarayan, Avinashnarayan; Raulji, Payal; Chakravarti, Deepavali; Su, Xiaohua; Sandur, Santosh K.; Sananikone, Eliot F.; Flores, Elsa R.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Mol & Cellular Oncol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Venkatanarayan, Avinashnarayan; Raulji, Payal; Chakravarti, Deepavali; Su, Xiaohua; Sandur, Santosh K.; Sananikone, Eliot F.; Tsai, Kenneth Y.; Flores, Elsa R.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Translat Mol Pathol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Venkatanarayan, Avinashnarayan; Chakravarti, Deepavali; Sananikone, Eliot F.; Flores, Elsa R.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Grad Sch Biomed Sci, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Venkatanarayan, Avinashnarayan; Chakravarti, Deepavali; Su, Xiaohua; Sandur, Santosh K.; Sananikone, Eliot F.; Flores, Elsa R.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Metastasis Res Ctr, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Norton, William; Naff, Katherine] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Vet Med & Surg, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Coarfa, Cristian; Rajapakshe, Kimal] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Sandur, Santosh K.] Bhabha Atom Res Ctr, Radiat Biol & Hlth Sci Div, Mumbai 400085, Maharashtra, India; [Ramirez, Marc S.; Lee, Jaehuk; Kingsley, Charles V.; Bankson, James A.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Imaging Phys, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Parker-Thornburg, Jan] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Genet, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Tsai, Kenneth Y.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Dermatol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Gunaratne, Preethi H.] Univ Houston, Dept Biol & Biochem, Houston, TX 77204 USA","Flores, ER (reprint author), Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Mol & Cellular Oncol, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",elsaflores@mdanderson.org,"Bankson, James/J-9798-2014; Rajapakshe, Kimal/P-1592-2015","Bankson, James/0000-0002-8574-154X; Tsai, Kenneth/0000-0001-5325-212X","NCI [R01CA160394, R01CA134796]; CPRIT [RP120124, RP101243-P5]; NCI-Cancer Center Core Grant [CA-16672]; Lymphoma SPORE [P50CA136411]; Hildegardo E. and Olga M.

The SAC prevents the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) ubiquitin ligase from recognizing cyclin B and securin by catalysing the incorporation of the APC/C co-activator, CDC20, into a complex called the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC). The SAC works through unattached kinetochores generating a diffusible 'wait anaphase' signal(1,2) that inhibits the APC/C in the cytoplasm, but the nature of this signal remains a key unsolved problem. Moreover, the SAC and the APC/C are highly responsive to each other: the APC/C quickly targets cyclin B and securin once all the chromosomes attach in metaphase, but is rapidly inhibited should kinetochore attachment be perturbed(3,4). How this is achieved is also unknown. Here, we show that the MCC can inhibit a second CDC20 that has already bound and activated the APC/C. We show how the MCC inhibits active APC/C and that this is essential for the SAC. Moreover, this mechanism can prevent anaphase in the absence of kinetochore signalling. Thus, we propose that the diffusible 'wait anaphase' signal could be the MCC itself, and explain how reactivating the SAC can rapidly inhibit active APC/C.","[Izawa, Daisuke; Pines, Jonathon] Gurdon Inst, Cambridge CB2 1QN, England; [Izawa, Daisuke; Pines, Jonathon] Dept Zool, Cambridge CB2 1QN, England","Pines, J (reprint author), Gurdon Inst, Tennis Court Rd, Cambridge CB2 1QN, England.",jp103@cam.ac.uk,,"Pines, Jonathon/0000-0002-5227-6004",Cancer Research UK; Wellcome Trust; CR UK,"We are grateful to T.

A common oxidized nucleoside is 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine, which is found both in DNA (8-oxo-G) and as a free nucleotide (8-oxo- dGTP)(2,3). Nucleotide pools are especially vulnerable to oxidative damage(4). Therefore cells encodeanenzyme(MutT/MTH1) that removes free oxidized nucleotides. This cleansing function is required for cancer cell survival(5,6) and to modulate Escherichia coli antibiotic sensitivity in a DNA polymerase (pol)-dependent manner(7). How polymerases discriminate between damaged and non-damaged nucleotides is not well understood. This analysis is essential given the role of oxidized nucleotides in mutagenesis, cancer therapeutics, and bacterial antibiotics(8). Even with cellular sanitizing activities, nucleotide pools contain enough 8-oxo-dGTP to promote mutagenesis(9,10). This arises from the dual coding potential where 8-oxo-dGTP(anti) base pairs with cytosine and 8-oxo-dGTP(syn) uses its Hoogsteen edge to base pair with adenine(11). Here we use time-lapse crystallography to follow 8-oxo-dGTP insertion opposite adenine or cytosine with human pol beta, to reveal that insertion is accommodated in either the syn-oranti-conformation, respectively. For 8-oxo-dGTP(anti) insertion, a novel divalent metal relieves repulsive interactions between the adducted guanine base and the triphosphate of the oxidized nucleotide. With either templating base, hydrogen-bonding interactions between the bases are lost as the enzyme reopens after catalysis, leading to a cytotoxic nicked DNA repair intermediate. Combining structural snapshots with kinetic and computational analysis reveals how 8-oxo-dGTP uses charge modulation during insertion that can lead to a blocked DNA repair intermediate.","[Freudenthal, Bret D.; Beard, William A.; Perera, Lalith; Shock, David D.; Wilson, Samuel H.] NIEHS, Struct Biol Lab, NIH, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Kim, Taejin; Schlick, Tamar] NYU, Dept Chem, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Kim, Taejin; Schlick, Tamar] NYU Shanghai, NYU ECNU Ctr Computat Chem, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Kim, Taejin; Schlick, Tamar] NYU, Courant Inst Math Sci, New York, NY 10012 USA","Wilson, SH (reprint author), NIEHS, Struct Biol Lab, NIH, POB 12233, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.",wilson5@niehs.nih.gov,,,"US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [W-31-109-Eng-38]; Intramural Research Program of the National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences [Z01-E5050158, Z01-ES050161, ZIC-ES043010]; National Institutes of Health [1U19CA105010]; Philip Morris USA Inc.; Philip Morris International","We thank the Collaborative Crystallography group at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences for help with data collection and analysis.

Mammalian genomic DNA methylation is established during embryogenesis by de novo DNA methyltransferases, DNMT3A and DNMT3B(6-8), and the methylation patterns vary with developmental stages and cell types(9-12). DNAmethyltransferase 3-like protein (DNMT3L) is a catalytically inactive paralogue of DNMT3 enzymes, which stimulates the enzymatic activity of Dnmt3a(13). Recent studies have established a connection between DNA methylation and histone modifications, and revealed a histone-guided mechanism for the establishment of DNA methylation(14). The ATRX-DNMT3-DNMT3L (ADD) domain of Dnmt3a recognizes unmethylated histone H3 (H3K4me0)(15-17). The histone H3 tail stimulates the enzymatic activity of Dnmt3a in vitro(17,18), whereas the molecular mechanism remains elusive. Here we show that DNMT3A exists in an autoinhibitory form and that the histone H3 tail stimulates its activity in a DNMT3L-independent manner. We determine the crystal structures of DNMT3A-DNMT3L (autoinhibitory form) and DNMT3A-DNMT3L-H3 (active form) complexes at 3.82 and 2.90 angstrom resolution, respectively. Structural and biochemical analyses indicate that the ADD domain of DNMT3A interacts with and inhibits enzymatic activity of the catalyticdomain (CD) through blocking its DNA-binding affinity. HistoneH3(but not H3K4me3) disrupts ADD-CD interaction, induces a large movement of the ADD domain, and thus releases the autoinhibition of DNMT3A. The finding adds another layer of regulation of DNA methylation to ensure that the enzyme is mainly activated at proper targeting loci when unmethylated H3K4 is present, and strongly supports a negative correlation between H3K4me3 and DNA methylation across the mammalian genome(9,10,19,20). Our study provides a new insight into an unexpected autoinhibition and histone H3-induced activation of the de novo DNA methyltransferase after its initial genomic positioning.","[Guo, Xue; Wang, Ling; Li, Jie; Xiao, Jianxiong; Yin, Xiaotong; He, Shuang; Xu, Yanhui] Fudan Univ, Shanghai Med Coll, Inst Biomed Sci, Shanghai Canc Ctr, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China; [Guo, Xue; Wang, Ling; Xu, Yanhui] Fudan Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Genet Engn, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Ding, Zhanyu; Cong, Yao] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Biol Sci, Natl Ctr Prot Sci Shanghai, State Key Lab Mol Biol,Inst Biochem & Cell Biol, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China; [Shi, Pan; Tian, Changlin] Chinese Acad Sci, High Magnet Field Lab, Hefei 230031, Peoples R China; [Shi, Pan; Tian, Changlin] Univ Sci & Technol China, Natl Lab Phys Sci Microscale, Hefei 230026, Peoples R China; [Shi, Pan; Tian, Changlin] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Life Sci, Hefei 230026, Peoples R China; [Dong, Liping; Li, Guohong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Biophys, Natl Lab Biomacromol, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Dong, Liping] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jiawei] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Biomembrane & Membrane Biotechnol, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China","Xu, YH (reprint author), Fudan Univ, Shanghai Med Coll, Inst Biomed Sci, Shanghai Canc Ctr, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China.",xuyh@fudan.edu.cn,,,"National Basic Research Program of China [2011CB965300, 2009CB918600, 2013CB910401]; National Science & Technology Major Project 'Key New Drug Creation and Manufacturing Program' of China [2014ZX09507-002, 2011ZX09506-001]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31270779, 91419301, 31030019, U1432242, 31270771, 31222016, 31300685, U1332138]; Basic Research Project of Shanghai Science and Technology Commission [12JC1402700, 13JC1406300]; Fok Ying Tung Education Foundation [20090071220012]; Chinese Academy of Sciences Pilot Strategic Science and Technology Projects B [XDB08030201, XDB08030302]","We thank staff of beamline BL17U at Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility, China, for their assistance in data collection, and H.

Synthetic approaches to produce antibiotics have been unable to replace this platform. Uncultured bacteria make up approximately 99% of all species in external environments, and are an untapped source of new antibiotics. We developed several methods to grow uncultured organisms by cultivation in situ or by using specific growth factors. Here we report a new antibiotic that we term teixobactin, discovered in a screen of uncultured bacteria. Teixobactin inhibits cell wall synthesis by binding to a highly conserved motif of lipid II (precursor of peptidoglycan) and lipid III (precursor of cell wall teichoic acid). We did not obtain any mutants of Staphylococcus aureus or Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to teixobactin.

This pathway is prominent at the leading edges of cells where phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate-produced by the dephosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate by SHIP1 and SHIP2-recruits lamellipodin, which in turn engages endophilin. This pathway mediates the ligand-triggered uptake of several G-protein-coupled receptors such as alpha(2a)- and beta(1)-adrenergic, dopaminergic D3 and D4 receptors and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 4, the receptor tyrosine kinases EGFR, HGFR, VEGFR, PDGFR, NGFR and IGF1R, as well as interleukin-2 receptor.

Particularly in meiosis I, unlike in mitosis, sister kinetochores are captured by microtubules emanating from the same spindle pole (mono-orientation) and centromeric cohesion mediated by cohesin is protected in the following anaphase. Although meiotic kinetochore factors have been identified only in budding and fission yeasts, these molecules and their functions are thought to have diverged earlier. Therefore, a conserved mechanism for meiotic kinetochore regulation remains elusive. Here we have identified in mouse a meiosis-specific kinetochore factor that wetermed MEIKIN, which functions in meiosis I but not in meiosis II or mitosis. MEIKIN plays a crucial role in both mono-orientation and centromeric cohesion protection, partly by stabilizing the localization of the cohesin protector shugoshin. These functions are mediated mainly by the activity of Polo-like kinase PLK1, which is enriched to kinetochores in a MEIKIN-dependent manner. Our integrative analysis indicates that the long-awaited key regulator of meiotic kinetochore function is Meikin, which is conserved from yeasts to humans.","[Kim, Jihye; Ishiguro, Kei-ichiro; Nambu, Aya; Akiyoshi, Bungo; Yokobayashi, Shihori; Kagami, Ayano; Ishiguro, Tadashi; Tanno, Yuji; Sakuno, Takeshi; Watanabe, Yoshinori] Univ Tokyo, Inst Mol & Cellular Biosci, Lab Chromosome Dynam, Tokyo 1130032, Japan; [Pendas, Alberto M.] CSIC, USAL, Inst Biol Mol & Celular Canc, Salamanca 37007, Spain; [Takeda, Naoki] Kumamoto Univ, Ctr Anim Resources & Dev, Kumamoto 8600811, Japan; [Sakakibara, Yogo; Kitajima, Tomoya S.] RIKEN Ctr Dev Biol, Lab Chromosome Segregat, Chuo Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan","Watanabe, Y (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Inst Mol & Cellular Biosci, Lab Chromosome Dynam, 1-1-1Yayoi, Tokyo 1130032, Japan.",ywatanab@iam.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Kitajima, Tomoya/A-7049-2016; Pendas, Alberto/L-1017-2014","Kitajima, Tomoya/0000-0002-6486-7143; Pendas, Alberto M/0000-0001-9264-3721; Akiyoshi, Bungo/0000-0001-6010-394X","JSPS Research Fellowship; Uehara Memorial Foundation; RIKEN CDB intramural grant; MEXT, Japan;  [SAF2011-25252]","We thank K.

Convection on these bodies is currently thought to have been thermally driven(7,8), implying that magnetic activity would have been short-lived(9). Here we report a time-series palaeomagnetic record derived from nanomagnetic imaging(10) of the Imilac and Esquel pallasite meteorites, a group of meteorites consisting of centimetre-sized metallic and silicate phases. We find a history of long-lived magnetic activity on the pallasite parent body, capturing the decay and eventual shutdown of the magnetic field as core solidification completed. We demonstrate that magnetic activity driven by progressive solidification of an inner core(11-13) is consistent with our measured magnetic field characteristics and cooling rates(14). Solidification-driven convection was probably common among small body cores(15), and, in contrast to thermally driven convection, will have led to a relatively late (hundreds of millions of years after accretion), long-lasting, intense and widespread epoch of magnetic activity among these bodies in the early Solar System.","[Bryson, James F.

We investigated phase stability, morphology of the perovskite layer, hysteresis in current-voltage characteristics, and overall performance as a function of chemical composition. Our results show that incorporation of MAPbBr(3) into FAPbI(3) stabilizes the perovskite phase of FAPbI(3) and improves the power conversion efficiency of the solar cell to more than 18 per cent under a standard illumination of 100 milliwatts per square centimetre.

Several previous analyses of tide gauge records(1-6)-employing different methods to accommodate the spatial sparsity and temporal incompleteness of the data and to constrain the geometry of long-term sea-level change-have concluded that GMSL rose over the twentieth century at a mean rate of 1.6 to 1.9 millimetres per year. Efforts to account for this rate by summing estimates of individual contributions from glacier and ice-sheet mass loss, ocean thermal expansion, and changes in land water storage fall significantly short in the period before 1990(7). The failure to close the budget of GMSL during this period has led to suggestions that several contributions may have been systematically underestimated(8). However, the extent to which the limitations of tide gauge analyses have affected estimates of the GMSL rate of change is unclear. Here we revisit estimates of twentieth-century GMSL rise using probabilistic techniques(9,10) and find a rate of GMSL rise from 1901 to 1990 of 1.2 +/- 0.2 millimetres per year (90% confidence interval). Based on individual contributions tabulated in the Fifth Assessment Report(7) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, this estimate closes the twentieth-century sea-level budget. Our analysis, which combines tide gauge records with physics-based and model-derived geometries of the various contributing signals, also indicates that GMSL rose at a rate of 3.0 +/- 0.7 millimetres per year between 1993 and 2010, consistent with prior estimates from tide gauge records(4). The increase in rate relative to the 1901-90 trend is accordingly larger than previously thought; this revision may affect some projections(11) of future sea-level rise.","[Hay, Carling C.; Morrow, Eric; Mitrovica, Jerry X.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Hay, Carling C.; Morrow, Eric; Kopp, Robert E.] Rutgers State Univ, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; [Kopp, Robert E.] Rutgers State Univ, Rutgers Energy Inst, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA","Hay, CC (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",carlinghay@fas.harvard.edu,,"Kopp, Robert/0000-0003-4016-9428; Hay, Carling/0000-0002-9240-2036","US National Science Foundation [ARC-1203414, ARC-1203415]; New Jersey Sea Grant Consortium; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NJSGC) [6410-0012]; Rutgers University; Harvard University","Tide gauge data were provided by PMSL (www.psmsl.org).

One such group is the Ichthyopterygia, a clade of obligatory marine reptiles that appeared in the Early Triassic epoch, without any known intermediates(1). Here we describe a basal ichthyosauriform from the upper Lower Triassic (about 248 million years ago) of China, whose primitive skeleton indicates possible amphibious habits. It is smaller than ichthyopterygians and had unusually large flippers that probably allowed limited terrestrial locomotion. It also retained characteristics of terrestrial diapsid reptiles, including a short snout and body trunk(2). Unlike more-derived ichthyosauriforms(3), it was probably a suction feeder. The new species supports the sister-group relationships between ichthyosauriforms and Hupehsuchia(4), the two forming the Ichthyosauromorpha. Basal ichthyosauromorphs are known exclusively from south China, suggesting that the clade originated in the region, which formed a warm(5,6) and humid(7) tropical archipelago(8) in the Early Triassic.

Here we performed whole-exome sequencing on adenomas from three mouse models of non-small-cell lung cancer, which were induced either by exposure to carcinogens (methyl-nitrosourea (MNU) and urethane) or by genetic activation of Kras (Kras(LA2)). Although the MNU-induced tumours carried exactly the same initiating mutation in Kras as seen in the Kras(LA2) model (G12D), MNU tumours had an average of 192 non-synonymous, somatic single-nucleotide variants, compared with only six in tumours from the Kras(LA2) model. By contrast, the Kras(LA2) tumours exhibited a significantly higher level of aneuploidy and copy number alterations compared with the carcinogen-induced tumours, suggesting that carcinogen-induced and genetically engineered models lead to tumour development through different routes. The wild-type allele of Kras has been shown to act as a tumour suppressor inmouse models of non-small-cell lung cancer. We demonstrate that urethane-induced tumours from wild-type mice carry mostly (94%) Kras Q61R mutations, whereas those from Kras heterozygous animals carry mostly (92%) KrasQ61L mutations, indicating a major role for germ-line Kras status in mutation selection during initiation. The exome wide mutation spectra incarcinogen-induced tumours overwhelmingly display signatures of the initiating carcinogen, while adenocarcinomas acquire additional C > T mutations at CpG sites. These data provide a basis for understanding results from human tumour genome sequencing, which has identified two broad categories of tumours based on the relative frequency of single-nucleotide variations and copy number alterations(1), and underline the importance of carcinogen models for understanding the complex mutation spectra seen in human cancers.","[Westcott, Peter M.

In the clathrin pathway, dynamin uses mechanical energy from GTP hydrolysis to this effect(2-4), assisted by the BIN/amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain-containing protein endophilin(5,6). Clathrin-independent endocytic events are often less reliant on dynamin(7), and whether in these cases BAR domain proteins such as endophilin contribute to scission has remained unexplored. Here we show, in human and other mammalian cell lines, that endophilin-A2 (endoA2) specifically and functionally associates with very early uptake structures that are induced by the bacterial Shiga and cholera toxins, which are both clathrin-independent endocytic cargoes'. In controlled in vitro systems, endoA2 reshapes membranes before scission. Furthermore, we demonstrate that endoA2, dynamin and actin contribute in parallel to the scission of Shiga-toxin-induced tubules. Our results establish a novel function of endoA2 in clathrin-independent endocytosis. They document that distinct scission factors operate in an additive manner, and predict that specificity within a given uptake process arises from defined combinations of universal modules. Our findings highlight a previously unnoticed link between membrane scaffolding by endoA2 and pulling-force-driven dynamic scission.","[Renard, Henri-Francois; Garcia-Castillo, Maria Daniela; Arumugam, Senthil; Chambon, Valerie; Wunder, Christian; Johannes, Ludger] Inst Curie, Ctr Rech, Endocyt Trafficking & Therapeut Delivery Grp, F-75248 Paris 05, France; [Renard, Henri-Francois; Garcia-Castillo, Maria Daniela; Arumugam, Senthil; Chambon, Valerie; Lamaze, Christophe; Wunder, Christian; Johannes, Ludger] CNRS, UMR3666, F-75005 Paris, France; [Renard, Henri-Francois; Garcia-Castillo, Maria Daniela; Arumugam, Senthil; Chambon, Valerie; Lamaze, Christophe; Wunder, Christian; Johannes, Ludger] INSERM, U1143, F-75005 Paris, France; [Simunovic, Mijo; Bassereau, Patricia] Univ Paris 06, CNRS UMR 168, Inst Curie, Ctr Rech,Membrane & Cell Funct Grp, F-75248 Paris 05, France; [Simunovic, Mijo] Univ Chicago, Dept Chem, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Lemiere, Joel; Sykes, Cecile] Univ Paris 06, CNRS UMR 168, Inst Curie, Ctr Rech,Biomimetism Cell Movement Grp, F-75248 Paris 05, France; [Lemiere, Joel] Univ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, F-75205 Paris, France; [Boucrot, Emmanuel] UCL, Inst Struct & Mol Biol, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Boucrot, Emmanuel] Birkbeck Coll, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Lamaze, Christophe] Inst Curie, Ctr Rech, Membrane Dynam & Mech Intracellular Signaling Grp, F-75248 Paris 05, France; [Kenworthy, Anne K.] Vanderbilt Univ Sch Med, Dept Mol Physiol & Biophys, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [Schmidt, Anne A.] Univ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, CNRS, UMR7592,Inst Jacques Monod, F-75205 Paris 13, France; [McMahon, Harvey T.] MRC, Mol Biol Lab, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England","Johannes, L (reprint author), Inst Curie, Ctr Rech, Endocyt Trafficking & Therapeut Delivery Grp, 26 Rue Ulm, F-75248 Paris 05, France.",ludger.johannes@curie.fr,"Sykes, Cecile/B-1271-2016; Wunder, Christian/K-8542-2017; Johannes, Ludger/M-9778-2017; Lamaze, Christophe/M-4912-2017","Sykes, Cecile/0000-0003-3057-2600; Wunder, Christian/0000-0001-9091-0080; Johannes, Ludger/0000-0002-2168-0004; Simunovic, Mijo/0000-0001-9394-1552; Bassereau, Patricia/0000-0002-8544-6778","Agence Nationale pour la Recherche [ANR-09-BLAN-283, ANR-10-LBX-0038, ANR-11BSV201403, ANR-12-BSV5-0014]; Indo-French Centre for the Promotion of Advanced Science [3803]; Marie Curie Actions - Networks for Initial Training [FP7-PEOPLE-2010-ITN]; European Research Council [340485]; Marie Curie International Reintegration Grant [FP7-RG-277078]; Royal Society [RG120481]; Fondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le Cancer [DEQ20120323737]; National Institutes of Health [R01 GM106720]; La Ligue contre le Cancer, Comite de Paris [RS08/75-89]; Fondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le Cancer; AXA Research Funds; Biological Sciences Research Council; Chateaubriand fellowship; France and Chicago Collaborating in the Sciences grant","We would like to acknowledge the following people for help in experiments and providing materials or expertise: A.

Signalling through the mTOR pathway is known to be required for epithelial cell proliferation and tumour growth(3,5), and the current paradigm suggests that a critical function of mTOR activity is to upregulate translational initiation through phosphorylation of 4EBP 1 (refs 6, 7). This model predicts that the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, which does not efficiently inhibit 4EBP 1 (ref. 8), would be ineffective in limiting cancer progression in APC-deficient lesions. Here we show in mice that mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activity is absolutely required for the proliferation of Apc-deficient (but not wild-type) enterocytes, revealing an unexpected opportunity for therapeutic intervention. Although APC-deficient cells show the expected increases in protein synthesis, our study reveals that it is translation elongation, and not initiation, which is the rate-limiting component. Mechanistically, mTORC1-mediated inhibition of eEF2 kinase is required for the proliferation of APC-deficient cells. Importantly, treatment of established APC-deficient adenomas with rapamycin (which can target eEF2 through the mTORCI-56K-eEF2K axis) causes tumour cells to undergo growth arrest and differentiation. Taken together, our data suggest that inhibition of translation elongation using existing, clinically approved drugs, such as the rapalogs, would provide clear therapeutic benefit for patients at high risk of developing colorectal cancer.","[Faller, William J.; Ridgway, Rachel A.; Jamieson, Thomas; Karim, Saadia A.; Radulescu, Sorina; Huels, David J.; Myant, Kevin B.; Casey, Helen A.; Scopelliti, Alessandro; Cordero, Julia B.; Vidal, Marcos; Sansom, Owen J.] Canc Res UK Beatson Inst, Glasgow G61 1BD, Lanark, Scotland; [Jackson, Thomas J.; Knight, John R.

Yet IgGI, the predominant murine serum Ig isotype, cannot activate complement by the classical pathway, binds more avidly to an inhibitory than to stimulatory FcRs, and has limited ability to aggregate pathogens(1-3). In these regards, it resembles human IgG4 (ref. 4). We hypothesized that limited ability to activate effector mechanisms might protect against immune complex immunopathology. Here we show that IgG 1 -deficient (gamma 1(-)) mice(5), immunized with a potent antigen, develop lethal renal disease soon after they begin to produce antigen-specific antibody, whereas similarly immunized wildtype mice remain healthy. Surprisingly, renal disease in this model is complement and FcR independent and results from immune complex precipitation in glomerular capillaries, as in some cryoglobulinaemic humans(6). IgG3, which self-associates to form large immune complexes(7,8), accounts for more than 97% of the mouse Ig in this cryoglobulin; furthermore, glomerular disease develops when mice are injected with IgG3 anti-trinitrophenyl (TNP) monoclonal antibody followed by a TNP-labelled protein. Renal disease is prevented in both active and passive immunization models by antigen-specific IgGI; other isotypes are less potent at preventing disease. These observations demonstrate the adaptive significance of Ig isotypes that poorly activate effector mechanisms, reveal an immune-complex-dependent, complement- and FcR-independent nephrotoxic mechanism, and suggest that isotypes that poorly activate effector mechanisms may be useful for inhibiting immune complex immunopathology.","[Strait, Richard T.; Mahler, Ashley; Barasa, Nathaniel] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Emergency Med, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Strait, Richard T.] Univ Cincinnati, Coll Med, Dept Pediat, Cincinnati, OH 45267 USA; [Posgai, Monica T.; Herr, Andrew B.] Univ Cincinnati, Coll Med, Dept Mol Genet Biochem & Microbiol, Cincinnati, OH 45267 USA; [Jacob, Chaim O.] Univ So Calif, Sch Med, Dept Med, Los Angeles, CA 90033 USA; [Koehl, Joerg; Herr, Andrew B.; Finkelman, Fred D.] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Immunobiol, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Koehl, Joerg; Ehlers, Marc] Med Univ Lubeck, Inst Syst Inflammat Res, D-23538 Lubeck, Germany; [Stringer, Keith; Shanmukhappa, Shiva Kumar; Witte, David] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Pathol, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Hossain, Md Monir] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Biostat & Epidemiol, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Khodoun, Marat; Finkelman, Fred D.] Univ Cincinnati, Coll Med, Dept Med, Div Immunol Allergy & Rheumatol, Cincinnati, OH 45267 USA; [Finkelman, Fred D.] Cincinnati Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Med Serv, Cincinnati, OH 45220 USA","Finkelman, FD (reprint author), Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Immunobiol, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA.",finkelfd@UCMAIL.UC.EDU,"Ehlers, Marc/C-9441-2011; Hossain , Md/N-5360-2015; Koehl, Joerg/C-8531-2011","Koehl, Joerg/0000-0003-1121-3178; Herr, Andrew/0000-0002-3598-3399; Ehlers, Marc/0000-0002-5383-8603",US Department of Veterans Affairs Merit Award; National Institutes of Health [R01 AI072040]; Cincinnati Children's Hospital; University of Cincinnati,"We thank M.

First, the 55 kilodalton viral Gag polyprotein assembles into a hexameric protein lattice at the plasma membrane of the infected cell, inducing budding and release of an immature particle. Second, Gag is cleaved by the viral protease, leading to internal rearrangement of the virus into the mature, infectious form(1). Immature and mature HIV-1 particles are heterogeneous in size and morphology, preventing high-resolution analysis of their protein arrangement in situ by conventional structural biology methods. Here we apply cryo-electron tomography and sub -tomogram averaging methods to resolve the structure of the capsid lattice within intact immature HIV-1 particles at subnanometre resolution, allowing unambiguous positioning of all alpha-helices. The resulting model reveals tertiary and quaternary structural interactions that mediate HIV-1 assembly. Strikingly, these interactions differ from those predicted by the current model based on in vitro-assembled arrays of Gag-derived proteins from Mason-Pfizer monkey virus(2). To validate this difference, we solve the structure of the capsid lattice within intact immature Mason-Pfizer monkey virus particles. Comparison with the immature HIV-1 structure reveals that retroviral capsid proteins, while having conserved tertiary structures, adopt different quaternary arrangements during virus assembly. The approach demonstrated here should be applicable to determine structures of other proteins at subnanometre resolution within heterogeneous environments.","[Schur, Florian K. M.; Hagen, Wim J.

The lantibiotic nisin is an antimicrobial peptide that is widely used as a food preservative to combat food-borne pathogens(1). Nisin contains dehydroalanine and dehydrobutyrine residues that are formed by the dehydration of Ser/Thr by the lantibiotic dehydratase NisB (ref. 2). Recent biochemical studies revealed that NisB glutamylates Ser/Thr side chains as part of the dehydration process'. However, the molecular mechanism by which NisB uses glutamate to catalyse dehydration remains unresolved. Here we show that this process involves Outamyl-tRNA(Glu) to activate Ser/Thr residues. In addition, the 2.9-angstrom crystal structure of NisB in complex with its substrate peptide NisA reveals the presence of two separate domains that catalyse the Ser/Thr glutamylation and glutamate elimination steps. The co-crystal structure also provides insights into substrate recognition by lantibiotic dehydratases. Our findings demonstrate an unexpected role for aminoacyl-tRNA in the formation of dehydroamino acids in lantibiotics, and serve as a basis for the functional characterization of the many lantibiotic-like dehydratases involved in the biosynthesis of other classes of natural products.

Nevertheless, organohalide chemistry is not exclusively of anthropogenic origin, with natural abiotic and biological processes contributing to the global halide cycle(2,3). Reductive dehalogenases are responsible for biological dehalogenation in organohalide respiring bacteria(4,5), with substrates including polychlorinated biphenyls or dioxins(6,7). Reductive dehalogenases form a distinct subfamily of cobalamin (B12)-dependent enzymes that are usuallymembrane associated and oxygen sensitive, hindering detailed studies(8-12). Here we report the characterization of a soluble, oxygen-tolerant reductive dehalogenase and, by combining structure determination with EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance) spectroscopy and simulation, show that a direct interaction between the cobalamin cobalt and the substrate halogen underpins catalysis. In contrast to the carbon-cobalt bond chemistry catalysed by the other cobalamin-dependent subfamilies(13), we propose that reductive dehalogenases achieve reduction of the organohalide substrate via halogen-cobalt bond formation. This presents a new model in both organohalide and cobalamin (bio) chemistry that will guide future exploitation of these enzymes in bioremediation or biocatalysis.","[Payne, Karl A.

The African Genome Variation Project represents dense genotypes from 1,481 individuals and whole-genome sequences from 320 individuals across sub-Saharan Africa. Using this resource, we find novel evidence of complex, regionally distinct hunter-gatherer and Eurasian admixture across sub-Saharan Africa. We identify new loci under selection, including loci related to malaria susceptibility and hypertension. We show that modern imputation panels (sets of reference genotypes from which unobserved or missing genotypes in study sets can be inferred) can identify association signals at highly differentiated loci across populations in sub-Saharan Africa. Using whole-genome sequencing, we demonstrate further improvements in imputation accuracy, strengthening the case for large-scale sequencing efforts of diverse African haplotypes.

When extending an arm to reach for an object, the brain uses predictive models of both limb dynamics and target properties. Whether invertebrates use such models remains unclear. Here we examine to what extent prey interception by dragonflies (Plathemis lydia), a behaviour analogous to targeted reaching, requires internal models. By simultaneously tracking the position and orientation of a dragonfly's head and body during flight, we provide evidence that interception steering is driven by forward and inverse models of dragonfly body dynamics and by models of prey motion. Predictive rotations of the dragonfly's head continuously track the prey's angular position. The head-body angles established by prey tracking appear to guide systematic rotations of the dragonfly's body to align it with the prey's flight path. Model-driven control thus underlies the bulk of interception steering manoeuvres, while vision is used for reactions to unexpected prey movements. These findings illuminate the computational sophistication with which insects construct behaviour.","[Mischiati, Matteo; Lin, Huai-Ti; Herold, Paul; Leonardo, Anthony] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA; [Imler, Elliot] Univ Arizona, Dept Neurosci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Olberg, Robert] Union Coll, Schenectady, NY 12308 USA","Leonardo, A (reprint author), Howard Hughes Med Inst, Janelia Res Campus,19700 Helix Dr, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA.",leonardoa@janelia.hhmi.org,,,Howard Hughes Medical Institute; AFOSR [FA9550-10-1-0472],"We thank I.

Before chondrules formed, large differentiating planetesimals had already accreted(2). Volatile-rich olivine reveals that chondrules formed inextremely solid-rich environments, more like impact plumes than the solar nebula(3-5). The unique chondrules in CB chondrites probably formed in a vapour-melt plume produced by a hypervelocity impact(6) with an impact velocity greater than 10 kilometres per second. An acceptable formation model for the overwhelming majority of chondrules, however, has not been established. Here we report that impacts can produce enough chondrules during the first five million years of planetary accretion to explain their observed abundance. Building on a previous study of impact jetting(7), we simulate protoplanetary impacts, finding that material is melted and ejected at high speed when the impact velocity exceeds 2.5 kilometres per second. Using a Monte Carlo accretion code, we estimate the location, timing, sizes, and velocities of chondrule-formingimpacts. Ejecta size estimates(8) indicate that jetted melt will form millimetre-scale droplets. Our radiative transfermodels show that these droplets experience the expected cooling rates of ten to a thousand kelvin per hour(9,10). An impact origin for chondrules implies that meteorites are a byproduct of planet formation rather than leftover building material.","[Johnson, Brandon C.; Zuber, Maria T.] MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Minton, David A.; Melosh, H.

Microscopic theories describe this phenomenon as being based on the motion of Bloch wave packets(1). These wave packets are superpositions of individual Bloch states with the group velocity determined by the dispersion of the electronic band structure near the central wavevector in momentum space1. This concept has been verified experimentally in artificial superlattices by the observation of Bloch oscillations(2)-periodic oscillations of electrons in real and momentum space. Here we present a direct observation of electron wave packet motion in a real-space and real-time experiment, on length and time scales shorter than the Bloch oscillation amplitude and period. We show that attosecond metrology(3) (1 as=10(-18) seconds) now enables quantitative insight into weakly disturbed electron wave packet propagation on the atomic length scale without being hampered by scattering effects, which inevitably occur over macroscopic propagation length scales. Weuse sub-femtosecond(less than 10(-15) seconds) extreme-ultraviolet light pulses(3) to launch photoelectron wave packets inside a tungsten crystal that is covered by magnesium films of varied, well-defined thicknesses of a few angstroms(4). Probing the moment of arrival of the wave packets at the surface with attosecond precision reveals free-electron-like, ballistic propagation behaviour inside the magnesium adlayer-constituting the semi-classical limit of Bloch wave packet motion. Real-time access to electron transport through atomic layers and interfaces promises unprecedented insight into phenomena that may enable the scaling of electronic and photonic circuits to atomic dimensions. In addition, this experiment allows us to determine the penetration depth of electrical fields at optical frequencies at solid interfaces on the atomic scale.","[Neppl, S.; Jobst, M.; Barth, J.

Substantial progress over the past decade has improved our understanding of hydrophobic interactions in simple model systems(1,5-10), but most biologically and technologically relevant structures contain non-polar domains in close proximity to polar and charged functional groups. Theories and simulations exploring such nanometre-scale chemical heterogeneity find it can have an important effect(8,10-12), but the influence of this heterogeneity on hydrophobic interactions has not been tested experimentally. Here we report chemical force microscopy measurements on alkyl-functionalized surfaces that reveal a dramatic change in the surfaces' hydrophobic interaction strengths on coimmobilization of amine or guanidine groups. Protonation of amine groups doubles the strength of hydrophobic interactions, and guanidinium groups eliminate measurable hydrophobic interactions in all pH ranges investigated. We see these divergent effects of proximally immobilized cations also in single-molecule measurements on conformationally stable beta-peptides with non-polar subunits located one nanometre from either amine- or guanidine-bearing subunits. Our results demonstrate the importance of nanometre-scale chemical heterogeneity, with hydrophobicity not an intrinsic property of any given non-polar domain but strongly modulated by functional groups located as far away as one nanometre. The judicious placing of charged groups near hydrophobic domains thus provides a strategy for tuning hydrophobic driving forces to optimize molecular recognition or self-assembly processes.","[Ma, C.

Most strategies to obtain enantiomerically enriched molecules rely on either generating new stereogenic centres from prochiral substrates or resolving racemic mixtures of enantiomers. An alternative strategy dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation involves the transformation of a racemic starting material into a single enantiomer product, with greater than 50 per cent maximum yield(2,3). The use of stabilized nudeophiles (pK(a) < 25, where K-a is the acid dissociation constant) in palladium-catalysed asymmetric allylic alkylation reactions has proved to be extremely versatile in these processes(4,5). Conversely, the use of non-stabilized nudeophiles in such reactions is difficult and remains a key challenge'. Here we report a copper-catalysed dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation using racemic substrates and alkyl nudeophiles. These nudeophiles have a pK(a) of >= 50, more than 25 orders of magnitude more basic than the nudeophiles that are typically used in such transformations. Organometallic reagents are generated in situ from alkenes by hydrometallation and give highly enantioenriched products under mild reaction conditions. The method is used to synthesize natural products that possess activity against tuberculosis and leprosy, and an inhibitor of para-aminobenzoate biosynthesis. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction proceeds through a rapidly isomerizing intermediate. We anticipate that this approach will be a valuable complement to existing asymmetric catalytic methods.","[You, Hengzhi; Rideau, Emeline; Sidera, Mireia; Fletcher, Stephen P.] Univ Oxford, Dept Chem, Chem Res Lab, Oxford OX1 3TA, England","Fletcher, SP (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Dept Chem, Chem Res Lab, 12 Mansfield Rd, Oxford OX1 3TA, England.",stephen.fletcher@chem.ox.ac.uk,"Sidera, Mireia/N-3309-2015","Sidera, Mireia/0000-0002-7238-8433",EPSRC [EP/H003711/1],"We acknowledge financial support from the EPSRC (EP/H003711/1, a Career Acceleration Fellowship to S.P.F.).

The global distribution of uranium is a notable example. In early Earth history, the continental crust was enriched in uranium. Yet after the initial rise in atmospheric oxygen, about 2.4 billion years ago, the aqueous mobility of oxidized uranium resulted in its significant transport to the oceans and, ultimately, by means of subduction, back to the mantle(1-8). Here we explore the isotopic characteristics of this global uranium cycle. We show that the subducted flux of uranium is isotopically distinct, with high U-238/U-235 ratios, as a result of alteration processes at the bottom of an oxic ocean. We also find that mid-ocean-ridge basalts (MORB s) have U-238/U-235 ratios higher than does the bulk Earth, confirming the widespread pollution of the upper mantle with this recycled uranium. Although many ocean island basalts (OIBs) are argued to contain a recycled componene, their uranium isotopic compositions do not differ from those of the bulk Earth. Because subducted uranium was probably isotopically unfractionated before full oceanic oxidation, about 600 million years ago, this observation reflects the greater antiquity of OIB sources. Elemental and isotope systematics of uranium in OIBs are strikingly consistent with previous OIB lead model ages(10), indicating that these mantle reservoirs formed between 2.4 and 1.8 billion years ago. In contrast, the uranium isotopic composition of MORB requires the convective stirring of recycled uranium throughout the upper mantle within the past 600 million years.","[Andersen, Morten B.; Elliott, Tim; Freymuth, Heye] Univ Bristol, Sch Earth Sci, Bristol Isotope Grp, Bristol B58 1RJ, Avon, England; [Andersen, Morten B.] ETH, Dept Earth Sci, Inst Geochem & Petrol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Sims, Kenneth W.

When possible, this is preferred over the use of promiscuously integrating vectors, which are sometimes associated with clonal expansion(1) and oncogenesis(2). Site-specific endonudeases that can induce high rates of targeted genome editing are finding increasing applications in biological discovery and gene therapy(3). However, two safety concerns persist: endonudease-associated adverse effects, both on-target(4) and off-target(5,6); and oncogene activation caused by promoter integration, even without nucleases(7). Here we perform recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)-mediated promoterless gene targeting without nucleases and demonstrate amelioration of the bleeding diathesis in haemophilia B mice. In particular, we target a promoterless human coagulation factor IX (F9) gene to the liver-expressed mouse albumin (Alb) locus. F9 is targeted, along with a preceding 2A-peptide coding sequence, to be integrated just upstream to the Alb stop codon. While F9 is fused to Alb at the DNA and RNA levels, two separate proteins are synthesized by way of ribosomal skipping. Thus, F9 expression is linked to robust hepatic albumin expression without disrupting it. We injected an AAV8-F9 vector into neonatal and adult mice and achieved on-target integration into similar to 0.5% of the albumin alleles in hepatocytes. We established that F9 was produced only from on-target integration, and ribosomal skipping was highly efficient. Stable F9 plasma levels at 7-20% of normal were obtained, and treated F9-deficient mice had normal coagulation times. In conclusion, transgene integration as a 2A-fusion to a highly expressed endogenous gene may obviate the requirement for nucleases and/or vector-borne promoters. This method may allow for safe and efficacious gene targeting in both infants and adults by greatly diminishing off-target effects while still providing therapeutic levels of expression from integration.","[Barzel, A.; Paulk, N.

Conservation agriculture represents a set of three crop management principles that has received strong international support to help address this challenge(5,6), with recent conservation agriculture efforts focusing on smallholder farming systems in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia(7). However, conservation agriculture is highly debated, with respect to both its effects on crop yields(8-10) and its applicability in different farming contexts(7,11-13). Here we conduct a global meta-analysis using 5,463 paired yield observations from 610 studies to compare no-till, the original and central concept of conservation agriculture, with conventional tillage practices across 48 crops and 63 countries. Overall, our results show that no-till reduces yields, yet this response is variable and under certain conditions no-till can produce equivalent or greater yields than conventional tillage. Importantly, when no-till is combined with the other two conservation agriculture principles of residue retention and crop rotation, its negative impacts are minimized. Moreover, no-till in combination with the other two principles significantly increases rainfed crop productivity in dry climates, suggesting that it may become an important climate-change adaptation strategy for ever-drier regions of the world. However, any expansion of conservation agriculture should be done with caution in these areas, as implementation of the other two principles is often challenging in resource-poor and vulnerable smallholder farming systems, thereby increasing the likelihood of yield losses rather than gains. Although farming systems are multifunctional, and environmental and socio-economic factors need to be considered(14-16), our analysis indicates that the potential contribution of no-till to the sustainable intensification of agriculture is more limited than often assumed.","[Pittelkow, Cameron M.; Linquist, Bruce A.; Lundy, Mark E.; van Kessel, Chris] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Liang, Xinqiang] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Environm & Resource Sci, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [van Groenigen, Kees Jan; van Gestel, Natasja] No Arizona Univ, Ctr Ecosyst Sci & Soc, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Lee, Juhwan; Six, Johan] ETH, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Venterea, Rodney T.] ARS, USDA, Soil & Water Management Unit, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Venterea, Rodney T.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Soil Water & Climate, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Pittelkow, CM (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Dept Crop Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",cmpitt@illinois.edu,"Venterea, Rodney/A-3930-2009",", Juhwan/0000-0002-7967-2955",National Key Science and Technology Project of China [2014ZX07101-012],We are grateful to the National Key Science and Technology Project of China for supporting X.Q.L. with grant number 2014ZX07101-012.,,31,124,129,68,459,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,15-Jan,2015,517,7534,,,,,365,U482,,10.1038/nature13809,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,AY8NK,WOS:000347810300045,25337882,No,Y,N,11/20/17

In contrast, relatively little is known about the long-term evolution of species' phenotypic and genetic properties. This represents an important gap in our understanding of evolution, as exactly these proprieties play key roles in natural selection and adaptation to diverse environments. Here we perform a comparative analysis of bacterial growth and gene deletion phenotypes using hundreds of genome-scale metabolic models. Overall, bacterial phenotypic evolution can be described by a two-stage process with a rapid initial phenotypic diversification followed by a slow long-term exponential divergence. The observed average divergence trend, with approximately similar fractions of phenotypic properties changing per unit time, continues for billions of years. We experimentally confirm the predicted divergence trend using the phenotypic profiles of 40 diverse bacterial species across more than 60 growth conditions. Our analysis suggests that, at long evolutionary distances, gene essentiality is significantly more conserved than the ability to utilize different nutrients, while synthetic lethality is significantly less conserved. We also find that although a rapid phenotypic evolution is sometimes observed within the same species, a transition from high to low phenotypic similarity occurs primarily at the genus level.","[Plata, German; Vitkup, Dennis] Columbia Univ, Dept Syst Biol, Ctr Computat Biol & Bioinformat, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Plata, German] Columbia Univ, Integrated Program Cellular Mol Struct & Genet St, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Henry, Christopher S.] Argonne Natl Lab, Div Math & Comp Sci, Argonne, IL 60439 USA; [Vitkup, Dennis] Columbia Univ, Dept Biomed Informat, New York, NY 10032 USA","Vitkup, D (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Dept Syst Biol, Ctr Computat Biol & Bioinformat, New York, NY 10032 USA.",dv2121@columbia.edu,,"Plata, German/0000-0002-6470-7748","National Institute of General Medical Sciences [GM079759, U54CA121852]; Department of Energy, as part of the SB Knowledgebase [DE-AC02-06CH11357]","We thank B.

WUSCHEL (WUS), a homeodomain transcription factor expressed in the rib meristem of the Arabidopsis SAM, is a key regulatory factor controlling SAM stem cell populations(5,6), and is thought to establish the shoot stem cell niche through a feedback circuit involving the CLAVATA3 (CLV3) peptide signalling pathway(7). WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX 5 (WOX5), which is specifically expressed in the root quiescent centre, defines quiescent centre identity and functions interchangeably with WUS in the control of shoot and root stem cell niches(8). WOX4, expressed in Arabidopsisprocambial cells, defines the vascular stem cell niche(9-11). WUS/WOX family proteins are evolutionarily and functionally conserved throughout the plant kingdom(1,2) and emerge as key actors in the specification and maintenance of stem cells within all meristems13. However, the nature of the genetic regime in stem cell niches that centre on WOX gene function has been elusive, and molecular links underlying conserved WUS/WOX function in stem cell niches remain unknown. Here we demonstrate that the Arabidopsis HAIRY MERISTEM (HAM) family of transcription regulators act as conserved interacting cofactors with WUS/WOX proteins. HAM and WUS share common targets in vivo and their physical interaction is important in driving downstream transcriptional programs and in promoting shoot stem cell proliferation. Differences in the overlapping expression patterns of WOX and HAM family members underlie the formation of diverse stem cell niche locations, and the HAM family is essential for all of these stem cell niches. These findings establish a new framework for the control of stem cell production during plant development.","[Zhou, Yun; Liu, Xing; Nimchuk, Zachary L.; Tarr, Paul T.; Yan, An; Meyerowitz, Elliot M.] CALTECH, Div Biol, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Engstrom, Eric M.] Coll William & Mary, Dept Biol, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA; [Nimchuk, Zachary L.; Meyerowitz, Elliot M.] CALTECH, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Pruneda-Paz, Jose L.] Univ Calif San Diego, Sect Cell & Dev Biol, Div Biol Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Kay, Steve A.] Univ So Calif, Dept Biol Sci, Dana & David Dornsife Coll Letters Arts & Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA","Meyerowitz, EM (reprint author), CALTECH, Div Biol, 1200 East Calif Blvd, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",meyerow@caltech.edu,"Zhou, Yun/B-5542-2013",,"National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R01 GM104244]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation [GBMF3406]; NIH [GM094212, GM056006, GM067837]; Jane Coffin Childs (JCC) Memorial Fund for Medical Research","The authors are grateful to R.

This reservoir presents a major barrier to the cure of HIV-1 infection. To purge the reservoir, pharmacological reactivation of latent HIV-1 has been proposed(5) and tested both in vitro and in vivo(6-8). A key remaining question is whether virusspecific immune mechanisms, including cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), can clear infected cells in ART-treated patients after latency is reversed. Here we show that there is a striking all or none pattern for CTL escape mutations in HIV-1 Gag epitopes. Unless ART is started early, the vast majority (>98%) of latent viruses carry CTL escape mutations that render infected cells insensitive to CTLs directed at common epitopes. To solve this problem, we identified CTLs that could recognize epitopes from latent HIV-1 that were unmutated in every chronically infected patient tested. Upon stimulation, these CTLs eliminated target cells infected with autologous virus derived from the latent reservoir, both in vitro and in patient-derived humanized mice. The predominance of CTL-resistant viruses in the latent reservoir poses a major challenge to viral eradication. Our results demonstrate that chronically infected patients retain abroad-spectrum viral-specific CTL response and that appropriate boosting of this response may be required for the elimination of the latent reservoir.","[Deng, Kai; Pertea, Mihaela; Durand, Christine M.; Lai, Jun; McHugh, Holly L.; Siliciano, Janet D.; Siliciano, Robert F.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Pertea, Mihaela; Salzberg, Steven L.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Computat Biol, McKusick Nathans Inst Genet Med, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Rongvaux, Anthony; Strowig, Till; Flavell, Richard A.; Shan, Liang] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Immunobiol, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Wang, Leyao] Yale Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Chron Dis Epidemiol, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Ghiaur, Gabriel] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Oncol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Hao, Haiping] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Deep Sequencing & Microarray Core, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Zhang, Hao; Margolick, Joseph B.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Mol Microbiol & Immunol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Gurer, Cagan; Murphy, Andrew J.; Valenzuela, David M.; Yancopoulos, George D.] Regeneron Pharmaceut Inc, Tarrytown, NY 10591 USA; [Deeks, Steven G.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Med, San Francisco, CA 94110 USA; [Kumar, Priti] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Salzberg, Steven L.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biomed Engn, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Flavell, Richard A.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Siliciano, Robert F.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Flavell, RA (reprint author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Immunobiol, 333 Cedar St, New Haven, CT 06510 USA.",richard.flavell@yale.edu; liang.shan@yale.edu; rsiliciano@jhmi.edu,,"Hao, Haiping/0000-0002-8826-1568; Murphy, Andrew/0000-0003-4152-4081; Pertea, Mihaela/0000-0003-0762-8637; Flavell, Richard/0000-0003-4461-0778; Strowig, Till/0000-0003-0185-1459","Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Martin Delaney CARE; DARE Collaboratories (NIH grants) [AI096113, 1U19AI096109]; ARCH E Collaborative Research Grant from the Foundation for AIDS Research [amFAR 108165-50-RGRL]; Johns Hopkins Center for AIDS Research [P30AI094189]; NIH [43222, T32 AI07019]; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation","We thank all study participants.

Under some conditions, TIM-3 expression has also been shown to be stimulatory. Considering that TIM-3, like cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed death 1 (PD-1), is being targeted for cancer immunotherapy, it is important to identify the circumstances under which TIM-3 can inhibit and activate T-cell responses. Here we show that TIM-3 is co-expressed and forms a heterodimer with carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1), another well-known molecule expressed on activated T cells and involved in T-cell inhibition(6-10). Biochemical, biophysical and X-ray crystallography studies show that the membranedistal immunoglobulin-variable (IgV) -like amino-terminal domain of each is crucial to these interactions. The presence of CEACAM 1 endows TIM-3 with inhibitory function. CEACAM1 facilitates the maturation and cell surface expression of TIM-3 by forming a heterodimeric interaction in cis through the highly related membranedistal N-terminal domains of each molecule. CEACAM 1 and TIM-3 also bind in trans through their N-terminal domains. Both cis and trans interactions between CEACAM1 and TIM-3 determine the tolerance-inducing function of TIM-3. In a mouse adoptive transfer colitis model, CEACAM 1 -deficient T cells are hyper-inflammatory with reduced cell surface expression of TIM-3 and regulatory cytokines, and this is restored by T-cell-specific CEACAM 1 expression. During chronic viral infection and in a tumour environment, CEACAM1 and TIM-3 mark exhausted T cells. Co-blockade of CEACAM1 and TIM-3 leads to enhancement of anti-tumour immune responses with improved elimination of tumours in mouse colorectal cancer models. Thus, CEACAM 1 serves as a heterophilic ligand for TIM-3 that is required for its ability to mediate T-cell inhibition, and this interaction has a crucial role in regulating autoimmunity and anti-tumour immunity.","[Huang, Yu-Hwa; Kondo, Yasuyuki; Gandhi, Amit; Melum, Espen; Pyzik, Michal; Blumberg, Richard S.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Gastroenterol,Brigham & Womens Hosp, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Zhu, Chen; Anderson, Ana C.; Pertel, Thomas; Kuchroo, Vijay K.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Evergrande Ctr Immunol Dis, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Zhu, Chen; Anderson, Ana C.; Pertel, Thomas; Kuchroo, Vijay K.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Harvard Inst Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Russell, Andrew; Petsko, Gregory A.] Brandeis Univ, Rosenstiel Basic Med Sci Res Ctr, Waltham, MA 02454 USA; [Dougan, Stephanie K.; Ploegh, Hidde L.] MIT, Whitehead Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Petersen, Britt-Sabina; Franke, Andre] Univ Kiel, Inst Clin Mol Biol, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Melum, Espen] Oslo Univ Hosp, Norwegian PSC Res Ctr, Div Canc Med Surg & Transplantat, N-0424 Oslo, Norway; [Clayton, Kiera L.; Ostrowski, Mario A.] Univ Toronto, Dept Immunol, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [Raab, Monika; Rudd, Christopher E.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Pathol, Cell Signalling Sect, Cambridge CB2 1QP, England; [Chen, Qiang] Sichuan Univ, West China Hosp, State Key Lab Biotherapy, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China; [Beauchemin, Nicole] McGill Univ, Goodman Canc Res Ctr, Montreal, PQ H3G 1Y6, Canada; [Yazaki, Paul J.] City Hope Natl Med Ctr, Beckman Inst, Duarte, CA 91010 USA; [Ostrowski, Mario A.] St Michaels Hosp, Keenan Res Ctr, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [Glickman, Jonathan N.] Miraca Life Sci, GI Pathol, Newton, MA 02464 USA","Blumberg, RS (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Gastroenterol,Brigham & Womens Hosp, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",rblumberg@partners.org,"Petersen, Britt-Sabina/I-1671-2012; Franke, Andre/B-2151-2010; chen, qiang/M-1630-2016","Petersen, Britt-Sabina/0000-0001-9022-9017; Franke, Andre/0000-0003-1530-5811; chen, qiang/0000-0002-2398-4482","American Cancer Society [RSG-11-057-01-LIB]; Norwegian PSC research center; Unger Vetlesen Medical Fund; Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America fellowship grant; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) Cluster of Excellence 'Inflammation at Interfaces' Award; Harvard Clinical Translational Science Center [UL1 TR001102]; National Basic Research Program of China [2010CB529906]; Canadian Institute of Health Research [MOP-93787]; AACR-Pancreatic Cancer Action Network; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [GM32415, AI073748, NS045937, AI039671, AI056299, DK044319, DK051362, DK053056, DK088199]; Harvard Digestive Diseases Center (HDDC) [DK0034854]; High Point Foundation","We thank T.

Previous work has shown that phosphorylation of PPAR gamma (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) at serine 273 by cydin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) stimulates diabetogenic gene expression in adipose tissues(1). Inhibition of this modification is a key therapeutic mechanism for anti-diabetic drugs that bind PPAR gamma, such as the thiazolidinediones and PPAR gamma partial agonists or non-agonists(2). For a better understanding of the importance of this obesity-linked PPAR gamma phosphorylation, we created mice that ablated Cdk5 specifically in adipose tissues. These mice have both a paradoxical increase in PPAR gamma phosphorylation at serine 273 and worsened insulin resistance. Unbiased proteomic studies show that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinases are activated in these knockout animals. Here we show that ERK directly phosphorylates serine 273 of PPAR gamma in a robust manner and that Cdk5 suppresses ERKs through direct action on a novel site in MAP kinase/ ERK kinase (MEK). Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of MEK and ERK markedly improves insulin resistance in both obese wildtype and ob/ob mice, and also completely reverses the deleterious effects of the Cdk5 ablation. These data show that an ERK/Cdk5 axis controls PPAR gamma function and suggest that MEK/ERK inhibitors may hold promise for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.","[Banks, Alexander S.; Zushin, Peter-James H.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Endocrinol Diabet & Hypertens, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Banks, Alexander S.; Zushin, Peter-James H.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [McAllister, Fiona E.; Gygi, Steven P.; Spiegelman, Bruce M.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Camporez, Joao Paulo G.; Jurczak, Michael J.; Shulman, Gerald I.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Yale Mouse Metab Phenotyping Ctr, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Camporez, Joao Paulo G.; Jurczak, Michael J.; Shulman, Gerald I.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Camporez, Joao Paulo G.; Jurczak, Michael J.; Shulman, Gerald I.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cellular & Mol Physiol, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Laznik-Bogoslavski, Dina; Spiegelman, Bruce M.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Banks, AS (reprint author), Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Endocrinol Diabet & Hypertens, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",abanks@research.bwh.harvard.edu; bruce_spiegelman@dfci.harvard.edu,"Camporez, Joao Paulo/B-9122-2015; Banks, Alexander/B-4832-2012","Banks, Alexander/0000-0003-1787-6925; Jurczak, Michael/0000-0002-6335-6915","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [DK31405, DK93638]; Harvard University Milton Fund","We thank E.

ABC exporters are present both in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, with examples implicated in multidrug resistance of pathogens and cancer cells, as well as in many human diseases(3,4). TmrAB is a heterodimeric ABC exporter from the thermophilic Gram-negative eubacterium Therm us thermophilus; it is homologous to various multidrug transporters and contains one degenerate site with a non-catalytic residue next to the Walker B motif. Here we report a subnanometre-resolution structure of detergent-solubilized TmrAB in a nucleotide-free, inward-facing conformation by single-particle electron cryomicroscopy. The reconstructions clearly resolve characteristic features of ABC transporters, including helices in the transmembrane domain and nucleotide-binding domains. A cavity in the transmembrane domain is accessible laterally from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane as well as from the cytoplasm, indicating that the transporter lies in an inward-facing open conformation. The two nucleotide-binding domains remain in contact via their carboxy-terminal helices. Furthermore, comparison between our structure and the crystal structures of other ABC transporters suggests a possible trajectory of conformational changes that involves a sliding and rotating motion between the two nucleotide-binding domains during the transition from the inward-facing to outward-facing conformations.","[Kim, JungMin; Winter, Michael B.; Stroud, Robert M.; Craik, Charles S.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pharmaceut Chem, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Wu, Shenping; Tomasiak, Thomas M.; Robles-Colmanares, Yaneth; Stroud, Robert M.; Cheng, Yifan] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem & Biophys, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Mergel, Claudia; Stiller, Sebastian B.; Tampe, Robert] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Biochem, Bioctr, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany; [Tampe, Robert] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Cluster Excellence Macromol Complexes, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany","Stroud, RM (reprint author), Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Biochem, Bioctr, Max von Laue Str 9, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany.",stroud@msg.ucsf.edu; tampe@em.uni-frankfurt.de; Charles.Craik@ucsf.edu; ycheng@ucsf.edu,"Fachbereich14, Dekanat/C-8553-2015","Tampe, Robert/0000-0002-0403-2160","National Institutes of Health [R01GM098672, S10RR026814, P50GM082250, 1 P41CA196276-01, P50GM073210, R37GM024485]; University of California San Francisco Program for Breakthrough Biomedical Research; German Research Foundation [SFB 807, SFB 902, TA157/7]; European Drug Initiative on Channels and Transporters (EDICT) - European Commission Seventh Framework Program","This work was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (R01GM098672, S10RR026814 and P50GM082250 to Y.C., 1 P41CA196276-01 to C.S.C., P50GM073210 to R.M.S. and C.S.C., and R37GM024485 to R.M.S.), the University of California San Francisco Program for Breakthrough Biomedical Research (to Y.C.), and the German Research Foundation (SFB 807, SFB 902 and TA157/7 to R.T.) as well as the European Drug Initiative on Channels and Transporters (EDICT to R.T.) funded by the European Commission Seventh Framework Program.",,40,54,54,6,63,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,15-Jan,2015,517,7534,,,,,396,U598,,10.1038/nature13872,,17,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,AY8NK,WOS:000347810300052,25363761,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Here we conducted neural recordings in bats, mammals well-adapted to 3D spatial behaviours, and found head-direction cells tuned to azimuth, pitch or roll, or to conjunctive combinations of 3D angles, in both crawling and flying bats. Head-direction cells were organized along a functional-anatomical gradient in the presubiculum, transitioning from 2D to 3D representations. In inverted bats, the azimuth-tuning of neurons shifted by 180 degrees, suggesting that 3D head direction is represented in azimuth x pitch toroidal coordinates. Consistent with our toroidal model, pitch-cell tuning was unimodal, circular, and continuous within the available 360 degrees of pitch.

Here we show that yeast alpha-mannan is a viable food source for the Gram-negative bacterium Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a dominant member of the microbiota. Detailed biochemical analysis and targeted gene disruption studies support a model whereby limited cleavage of alpha-mannan on the surface generates large oligosaccharides that are subsequently depolymerized to mannose by the action of periplasmic enzymes. Co-culturing studies showed that metabolism of yeast mannan by B. thetaiotaomicron presents a 'selfish' model for the catabolism of this difficult to breakdown polysaccharide. Genomic comparison with B. thetaiotaomicron in conjunction with cell culture studies show that a cohort of highly successful members of the microbiota has evolved to consume sterically-restricted yeast glycans, an adaptation that may reflect the incorporation of eukaryotic microorganisms into the human diet.","[Cuskin, Fiona; Lowe, Elisabeth C.; Temple, Max J.; Zhu, Yanping; Rogowski, Artur; Munoz-Munoz, Jose L.; Day, Andrew; Gilbert, Harry J.] Newcastle Univ, Inst Cell & Mol Biosci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 4HH, Tyne & Wear, England; [Cuskin, Fiona; Zhu, Yanping; Pena, Maria J.; Abbott, D.

To colonize their hosts successfully, pathogens must sense their environment and regulate virulence gene expression appropriately. Accordingly, on entry into mammalian cells, the facultative intracellular bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes remodels its transcriptional program by activating the master virulence regulator PrfA. Here we show that bacterial and host-derived glutathione are required to activate PrfA. In this study a genetic selection led to the identification of a bacterial mutant in glutathione synthase that exhibited reduced virulence gene expression and was attenuated 150-fold in mice. Genome sequencing of suppressor mutants that arose spontaneously in vivo revealed a single nucleotide change in prfA that locks the protein in the active conformation (PrfA*) and completely bypassed the requirement for glutathione during infection. Biochemical and genetic studies support a model in which glutathione-dependent PrfA activation is mediated by allosteric binding of glutathione to PrfA. Whereas glutathione and other low-molecular-weight thiols have important roles in redox homeostasis in all forms of life, here we demonstrate that glutathione represents a critical signalling molecule that activates the virulence of an intracellular pathogen.","[Reniere, Michelle L.; John, Sonya M.; Portnoy, Daniel A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Whiteley, Aaron T.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Publ Hlth, Grad Grp Infect Dis & Immun, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Hamilton, Keri L.; Brennan, Richard G.] Duke Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Lauer, Peter] Aduro BioTech Inc, Berkeley, CA 94710 USA; [Portnoy, Daniel A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Publ Hlth, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Portnoy, DA (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",portnoy@berkeley.edu,,"Whiteley, Aaron/0000-0002-0075-7519","NIH [S10RR029668, S10RR027303]; UCSF; National Institutes of Health [1PO1 AI63302, 1R01 AI27655]; NSF GRFP [DGE 1106400];  [F32AI104247];  [F32GM008487]","We thank N.

Deep inside the star, nuclei (mainly iron) capture neutrons and progressively build up (through the slow-neutron-capture process(1,2), or s-process) heavier elements that are subsequently brought to the stellar surface by convection. Two neutron sources, activated at distinct temperatures, have been proposed: C-13 and Ne-22, each releasing one neutron per alpha-particle (He-4) captured(1-4). To explain the measured stellar abundances(1-7), stellar evolution models invoking the C-13 neutron source (which operates at temperatures of about one hundred million kelvin) are favoured. Isotopic ratios in primitive meteorites, however, reflecting nucleosynthesis in the previous generations of stars that contributed material to the Solar System, point to higher temperatures (more than three hundred million kelvin), requiring at least a late activation of Ne-22 (ref. 1). Here we report a determination of the s-process temperature directly in evolved low-mass giant stars, using zirconium and niobium abundances, independently of stellar evolution models. The derived temperature supports C-13 as the s-process neutron source. The radioactive pair Zr-93-Nb-93 used to estimate the s-process temperature also provides, together with the pair Tc-99-Ru-99, chronometric information on the time elapsed since the start of the s-process, which we determine to be one million to three million years.","[Neyskens, P.; Van Eck, S.; Jorissen, A.; Goriely, S.; Siess, L.] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Inst Astron & Astrophys, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Plez, B.] Univ Montpellier 2, CNRS, Lab Univ & Particules Montpellier, F-34095 Montpellier, France","Van Eck, S (reprint author), Univ Libre Bruxelles, Inst Astron & Astrophys, CP 226, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",svaneck@astro.ulb.ac.be,"Plez, Bertrand/G-6697-2011","Plez, Bertrand/0000-0002-0398-4434","FRIA (FNRS) fellowship; CNRS Programme National de Physique Stellaire; Action de recherche concertee (ARC) from the Direction generale de l'Enseignement non obligatoire et de la Recherche scientifique, Communaute francaise de Belgique; Fund for Scientific Research of Flanders (FWO); Research Council of K.U.

Optical approaches are ubiquitous in the distribution of entanglement because entangled photons are easy to generate and transmit. However, extending this direct distribution beyond a range of a few hundred kilometres(1,2) to a worldwide network is prohibited by losses associated with scattering, diffraction and absorption during transmission. A proposal to overcome this range limitation is the quantum repeater protocol(3,4), which involves the distribution of entangled pairs of optical modes among many quantum memories stationed along the transmission channel. To be effective, the memories must store the quantum information encoded on the optical modes for times that are long compared to the direct optical transmission time of the channel(5). Here we measure a decoherence rate of 8 x 10(-5) per second over 100 milliseconds, which is the time required for light transmission on a global scale. The measurements were performed on a ground-state hyperfine transition of europium ion dopants in yttrium orthosilicate (Eu-151(3+):Y2SiO5) using optically detected nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. The observed decoherence rate is at least an order of magnitude lower than that of any other system suitable for an optical quantum memory. Furthermore, by employing dynamic decoupling, a coherence time of 370 +/- 60 minutes was achieved at 2 kelvin. It has been almost universally assumed that light is the best long-distance carrier for quantum information. However, the coherence time observed here is long enough that nuclear spins travelling at 9 kilometres per hour in a crystal would have a lower decoherence with distance than light in an optical fibre. This enables some very early approaches(6,7) to entanglement distribution to be revisited, in particular those in which the spins are transported rather than the light.","[Zhong, Manjin; Hedges, Morgan P.; Ahlefeldt, Rose L.; Bartholomew, John G.; Beavan, Sarah E.; Wittig, Sven M.; Sellars, Matthew J.] Australian Natl Univ, Laser Phys Ctr, Ctr Quantum Computat & Commun Technol, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Hedges, Morgan P.] Princeton Univ, Dept Phys, Princeton, NJ 08554 USA; [Ahlefeldt, Rose L.] Univ Paris 11, Lab Aime Cotton, CNRS UPR 3321, F-91405 Orsay, France; [Ahlefeldt, Rose L.] ENS Cachan, F-91405 Orsay, France; [Beavan, Sarah E.] Univ Munich, Fak Phys, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Beavan, Sarah E.] Univ Munich, Ctr Nanosci CeNS, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Wittig, Sven M.] Kayser Threde GmbH, D-81379 Munich, Germany; [Longdell, Jevon J.] Univ Otago, Dodd Walls Ctr Photon & Quantum Technol, Dunedin 9016, New Zealand; [Longdell, Jevon J.] Univ Otago, Dept Phys, Dunedin 9016, New Zealand","Zhong, MJ (reprint author), Australian Natl Univ, Laser Phys Ctr, Ctr Quantum Computat & Commun Technol, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",grace.zhong@anu.edu.au,"Sellars, Matthew/J-3130-2014; Ahlefeldt, Rose/C-5466-2017","Sellars, Matthew/0000-0002-0502-0444; Ahlefeldt, Rose/0000-0002-2006-2941",Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology [CE110001027]; Australian Research Council Future Fellowship [FT110100919]; Marsden Fund of the Royal Society of New Zealand [UOO1221],"We thank N.

A persisting problem, however, is the dearth of chemical transformations that directly generate acyclic Z allylic alcohols, including products that contain a hindered neighbouring substituent or reactive functional units such as a phenol, an aldehyde, or a carboxylic acid. Here we present an electronically modified ruthenium-disulfide catalyst that is effective in generating such high-value compounds by cross-metathesis. The ruthenium complex is prepared from a commercially available precursor and an easily generated air-stable zinc catechothiolate. Transformations typically proceed with 5.0 mole per cent of the complex and an inexpensive reaction partner in 4-8 hours under ambient conditions; products are obtained in up to 80 per cent yield and 98:2 Z:E diastereoselectivity. The use of this catalyst is demonstrated in the synthesis of the naturally occurring anti-tumour agent neopeltolide and in a single-step stereoselective gram-scale conversion of a renewable feedstock (oleic acid) to an anti-fungal agent. In this conversion, the new catalyst promotes cross-metathesis more efficiently than the commonly used dichloro-ruthenium complexes, indicating that its utility may extend beyond Z-selective processes.","[Koh, Ming Joo; Khan, R.

It has been estimated that to have at least a 50 per cent chance of keeping warming below 2 degrees C throughout the twenty-first century, the cumulative carbon emissions between 2011 and 2050 need to be limited to around 1,100 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide (Gt CO2)(2,3). However, the greenhouse gas emissions contained in present estimates of global fossil fuel reserves are around three times higher than this(2,4), and so the unabated use of all current fossil fuel reserves is incompatible with a warming limit of 2 degrees C. Here we use a single integrated assessment model that contains estimates of the quantities, locations and nature of the world's oil, gas and coal reserves and resources, and which is shown to be consistent with a wide variety of modelling approaches with different assumptions(5), to explore the implications of this emissions limit for fossil fuel production in different regions. Our results suggest that, globally, a third of oil reserves, half of gas reserves and over 80 per cent of current coal reserves should remain unused from 2010 to 2050 in order to meet the target of 2 degrees C. We show that development of resources in the Arctic and any increase in unconventional oil production are incommensurate with efforts to limit average global warming to 2 degrees C. Our results show that policy makers' instincts to exploit rapidly and completely their territorial fossil fuels are, in aggregate, inconsistent with their commitments to this temperature limit. Implementation of this policy commitment would also render unnecessary continued substantial expenditure on fossil fuel exploration, because any new discoveries could not lead to increased aggregate production.","[McGlade, Christophe; Ekins, Paul] UCL, Inst Sustainable Resources, London WC1H 0NN, England","McGlade, C (reprint author), UCL, Inst Sustainable Resources, Cent House,14 Upper Woburn Pl, London WC1H 0NN, England.",christophe.mcglade@ucl.ac.uk,,,UK Research Councils under Natural Environment Research Council [NE/G007748/1],"We thank I.

Previous models of rifting events indicate either lateral dyke growth away from a feeding source, with propagation rates decreasing as the dyke lengthens(2-4), or magma flowing vertically into dykes from an underlying source(5,6), with the role of topography on the evolution of lateral dykes not clear. Here we show how a recent segmented dyke intrusion in the Bardarbunga volcanic system grew laterally for more than 45 kilometres at a variable rate, with topography influencing the direction of propagation. Barriers at the ends of each segment were overcome by the build-up of pressure in the dyke end; then a new segment formed and dyke lengthening temporarily peaked. The dyke evolution, which occurred primarily over 14 days, was revealed by propagating seismicity, ground deformation mapped by Global Positioning System(GPS), interferometric analysis of satellite radar images (InSAR), and graben formation. The strike of the dyke segments varies from an initially radial direction away from the Bardarbunga caldera, towards alignment with that expected from regional stress at the distal end. A model minimizing the combined strain and gravitational potential energy explains the propagation path. Dyke opening and seismicity focused at the most distal segment at any given time, and were simultaneous with magma source deflation and slow collapse at the Bardarbunga caldera, accompanied by a series of magnitude M > 5 earthquakes. Dyke growth was slowed down by an effusive fissure eruption near the end of the dyke. Lateral dyke growth with segment barrier breaking by pressure build-up in the dyke distal end explains how focused upwelling of magma under central volcanoes is effectively redistributed over long distances to create new upper crust at divergent plate boundaries.","[Sigmundsson, Freysteinn; Heimisson, Elias Rafn; Dumont, Stephanie; Parks, Michelle; Drouin, Vincent; Arnadottir, Thora; Gudmundsson, Magnus T.; Hognadottir, Thordis; Fridriksdottir, Hildur Maria; Einarsson, Pall; Magnusson, Eyjolfur; Brandsdottir, Bryndis; Hjartardottir, Asta Rut; Pedersen, Rikke; Bjornsson, Helgi; Palsson, Finnur] Univ Iceland, Inst Earth Sci, Nord Volcanol Ctr, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Hooper, Andrew; Spaans, Karsten] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Ctr Observat & Modelling Earthquakes & Tecton CCM, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Hreinsdottir, Sigrun] GNS Sci, Lower Hutt 5040, New Zealand; [Vogfjord, Kristin S.; Ofeigsson, Benedikt G.; Gudmundsson, Gunnar B.; Jonsdottir, Kristin; Fridriksdottir, Hildur Maria; Hensch, Martin] Iceland Meteorol Off, IS-150 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Samsonov, Sergey] Nat Resources Canada, Canada Ctr Mapping & Earth Observat, Ottawa, ON K1A 0EA, Canada; [White, Robert S.; Agustsdottir, Thorbjoerg; Greenfield, Tim; Green, Robert G.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Earth Sci, Cambridge CB3 0EZ, England; [Bennett, Richard A.] Univ Arizona, Dept Geosci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Geirsson, Halldor; La Femina, Peter C.] Penn State Univ, Dept Geosci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Sturkell, Erik] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Earth Sci, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Bean, Christopher J.; Mollhoff, Martin; Braiden, Aoife K.; Eibl, Eva P.

It is commonly argued that internal fertilization can evolve from external, but not the reverse. Male copulatory claspers are present in certain placoderms(2-4), fossil jawed vertebrates retrieved as a paraphyletic segment of the gnathostome stem group in recent studies(5-8). This suggests that internal fertilization could be primitive for gnathostomes, but such a conclusion depends on demonstrating that copulation was not just a specialized feature of certain placoderm subgroups. The reproductive biology of antiarchs, consistently identified as the least crownward placoderms(5-8) and thus of great interest in this context, has until now remained unknown. Here we show that certain antiarchs possessed dermal claspers in the males, while females bore paired dermal plates inferred to have facilitated copulation. These structures are not associated with pelvic fins. The clasper morphology resembles that of ptyctodonts, a more crownward placoderm group(7,8), suggesting that all placoderm claspers are homologous and that internal fertilization characterized all placoderms. This implies that external fertilization and spawning, which characterize most extant aquatic gnathostomes, must be derived from internal fertilization, even though this transformation has been thought implausible. Alternatively, the substantial morphological evidence for placoderm paraphyly must be rejected.","[Long, John A.; Choo, Brian] Flinders Univ S Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [Long, John A.; Choo, Brian] Flinders Univ S Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Adelaide, SA 2100, Australia; [Long, John A.] Nat Hist Museum Los Angeles Cty, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Long, John A.] Museum Victoria, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia; [Mark-Kurik, Elga] Tallinn Univ Technol, Inst Geol, EE-19086 Tallinn, Estonia; [Johanson, Zerina] Nat Hist Museum, Dept Earth Sci, London SW7 5BD, England; [Lee, Michael S.

While such firing flexibility and diversity have been linked to spatial memory, attention and task performance(6,7), the cellular and network origin of these place cell features is unknown. Basic integrate-and-fire models of place firing propose that such features result solely from varying inputs to place cells(8,9), but recent studies(3,10) suggest instead that place cells themselves may play an active role through regenerative dendritic events. However, owing to the difficulty of performing functional recordings from place cell dendrites, no direct evidence of regenerative dendritic events exists, leaving any possible connection to place coding unknown. Using multi-plane two-photon calcium imaging of CA1 place cell somata, axons and dendrites in mice navigating a virtual environment, here we show that regenerative dendritic events do exist in place cells of behaving mice, and, surprisingly, their prevalence throughout the arbour is highly spatiotemporally variable. Furthermore, we show that the prevalence of such events predicts the spatial precision and persistence or disappearance of place fields. This suggests that the dynamics of spiking throughout the dendritic arbour may play a key role in forming the hippocampal representation of space.","[Sheffield, Mark E.

Many antibiotics destroy intestinal microbial communities and increase susceptibility to intestinal pathogens(2). Among these, Clostridium difficile, a major cause of antibiotic-induced diarrhoea, greatly increases morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients(3). Which intestinal bacteria provide resistance to C. difficile infection and their in vivo inhibitory mechanisms remain unclear. Here we correlate loss of specific bacterial taxa with development of infection, by treating mice with different antibiotics that result in distinct microbiota changes and lead to varied susceptibility to C. difficile. Mathematical modelling augmented by analyses of the microbiota of hospitalized patients identifies resistance-associated bacteria common to mice and humans. Using these platforms, we determine that Clostridium scindens, a bile acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylating intestinal bacterium, is associated with resistance to C. difficile infection and, upon administration, enhances resistance to infection in a secondary bile acid dependent fashion. Using a workflow involving mouse models, clinical studies, metagenomic analyses, and mathematical modelling, we identify a probiotic candidate that corrects a clinically relevant microbiome deficiency. These findings have implications for the rational design of targeted antimicrobials as well as microbiome-based diagnostics and therapeutics for individuals at risk of C. difficile infection.","[Buffie, Charlie G.; McKenney, Peter T.; Kinnebrew, Melissa; Taur, Ying; Pamer, Eric G.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Med, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Buffie, Charlie G.; McKenney, Peter T.; Ling, Lilan; Gobourne, Asia; No, Daniel; Kinnebrew, Melissa; Littmann, Eric; Taur, Ying; Toussaint, Nora C.; Xavier, Joao B.; Pamer, Eric G.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Lucille Castori Ctr Microbes Inflammat & Canc, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Bucci, Vanni; Stein, Richard R.; Sander, Chris; Toussaint, Nora C.; Xavier, Joao B.] Sloan Kettering Inst, Computat Biol Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Bucci, Vanni] Univ Massachusetts Dartmouth, Dept Biol, N Dartmouth, MA 02747 USA; [Liu, Hui; Cross, Justin R.] Sloan Kettering Inst, Donald B & Catherine C Marron Canc Metab Ctr, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Viale, Agnes] Sloan Kettering Inst, Genom Core Lab, New York, NY 10065 USA; [van den Brink, Marcel R.

Previous studies have demonstrated that cancer stem cells (CSCs) are selectively enriched after chemotherapy through enhanced survival(1-3). Here we reveal a new mechanism by which bladder CSCs actively contribute to therapeutic resistance via an unexpected proliferative response to repopulate residual tumours between chemotherapy cycles, using human bladder cancer xenografts. Further analyses demonstrate the recruitment of a quiescent label-retaining pool of CSCs into cell division in response to chemotherapy-induced damages, similar to mobilization of normal stem cells during wound repair(4-7). While chemotherapy effectively induces apoptosis, associated prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)) release paradoxically promotes neighbouring CSC repopulation. This repopulation can be abrogated by a PGE(2)-neutralizing antibody and celecoxib drug-mediated blockade of PGE(2) signalling. In vivo administration of the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) inhibitor celecoxib effectively abolishes a PGE(2)- and COX2-mediated wound response gene signature, and attenuates progressive manifestation of chemoresistance in xenograft tumours, including primary xenografts derived from a patient who was resistant to chemotherapy. Collectively, these findings uncover a new underlying mechanism that models the progressive development of clinical chemoresistance, and implicate an adjunctive therapy to enhance chemotherapeutic response of bladder urothelial carcinomas by abrogating early tumour repopulation.","[Kurtova, Antonina V.; Xiao, Jing; Roh, Terrence T.; Chan, Keith Syson] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Kurtova, Antonina V.; Chan, Keith Syson] Baylor Coll Med, Program Translat Biol & Mol Med, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Mo, Qianxing; Chen, Fengju; Chan, Keith Syson] Baylor Coll Med, Dan L Duncan Canc Ctr, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Mo, Qianxing; Chen, Fengju; Chan, Keith Syson] Baylor Coll Med, Ctr Cell Gene & Therapy, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Pazhanisamy, Senthil; Krasnow, Ross; Lerner, Seth P.; Lay, Erica; Ho, Philip Levy; Chan, Keith Syson] Baylor Coll Med, Scott Dept Urol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Roh, Terrence T.] Baylor Coll Med, Summer Med & Res Training SMART Program, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Chan, KS (reprint author), Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, One Baylor Plaza, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",kc1@bcm.edu,"Kurtova, Antonina/H-6546-2015","Roh, Terrence/0000-0001-6831-1153; Krasnow, Ross/0000-0001-9773-9431","National Cancer Institute [CA129640, CA175397]; V Scholar Award; Dan L Duncan Career Award; Bladder Cancer Partnership; CPRIT pre-doctoral fellowship [RP101499]; AUA Research Scholar Award; CPRIT training grant [RP140102]","We would like to thank S.

How follicular T-helper (T-FH) cells regulate GC selection is not clear(3,4). Using competitive mixed chimaera, we show here that, beyond the role in promoting T-FH development(5-7), ICOSL (inducible T-cell co-stimulator ligand, also known as ICOSLG) is important for individual B cells to competitively participate in the GC reaction and to develop into BMPCs. Using intravital imaging aided by a calcium reporter, we further show that ICOSL promotes an 'entangled' mode of T-FH-B-cell interactions, characterized by brief but extensive surface engagement, productive T-cell calcium spikes, and B-cell acquisition of CD40 signals. Reiterated entanglement promotes outer-zone co-localization of outcompeting GC B cells together with T-FH cells, affording the former increased access to T-cell help. ICOSL on GC B cells is upregulated by CD40 signals. Such an intercellular positive feedback between contact-dependent help and ICOSL-controlled entanglement promotes positive selection and BMPC development, as evidenced by observations that higher-affinity B-cell receptor variants are enriched in the ICOSLhigh fraction, that numerically disadvantaged ICOSL-deficient GC B cells or BMPCs exhibit strong affinity compensation in competitive chimaera, and that when GC competition proceeds without ICOSL, selection of high-affinity variants in otherwise normal GC reactions is impaired. By demonstrating entanglement as the basic form of GC T-FH-B-cell interactions, identifying ICOSL as a molecular linkage between T-B interactional dynamics and positive selection for high-affinity BMPC formation, our study reveals a pathway by which T-FH cells control the quality of long-lived humoral immunity.","[Liu, Dan; Xu, Heping; Shih, Changming; Wan, Zurong; Ma, Weiwei; Luo, Dan; Qi, Hai] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Med, Lab Dynam Immunobiol, Tsinghua Peking Ctr Life Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Ma, Xiaopeng] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Life Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China","Qi, H (reprint author), Tsinghua Univ, Sch Med, Lab Dynam Immunobiol, Tsinghua Peking Ctr Life Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",qihai@tsinghua.edu.cn,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology '973' program [2014CB542501]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [81330070, 81361120397]; Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program [20131089224]; Institut Merieux; Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Sciences","We thank L. and M.

Axonal fusion, a spontaneous regenerative mechanism identified in several species, provides an efficient means of achieving target reconnection as a regrowing axon is able to contact and fuse with its own separated axon fragment, thereby re-establishing the original axonal tract(1-7). Here we report a molecular characterization of this process in Caenorhabditis elegans, revealing dynamic changes in the subcellular localization of the EFF-1 fusogen after axotomy, and establishing phosphatidylserine (PS) and the PS receptor (PSR-1) as critical components for axonal fusion. PSR-1 functions cell-autonomously in the regrowing neuron and, instead of acting in its canonical signalling pathway(8), acts in a parallel phagocytic pathway that includes the transthyretin protein TTR-52, as well as CED-7, NRF-5 and CED-6 (refs 9-12). We show that TTR-52 binds to PS exposed on the injured axon, and can restore fusion several hours after injury. We propose that PS functions as a 'save-me' signal for the distal fragment, allowing conserved apoptotic cell clearance molecules to function in reestablishing axonal integrity during regeneration of the nervous system.","[Neumann, Brent; Coakley, Sean; Giordano-Santini, Rosina; Linton, Casey; Hilliard, Massimo A.] Univ Queensland, Queensland Brain Inst, CJCADR, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Lee, Eui Seung; Nakagawa, Akihisa; Xue, Ding] Univ Colorado, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","Hilliard, MA (reprint author), Univ Queensland, Queensland Brain Inst, CJCADR, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",m.hilliard@uq.edu.au,,"Neumann, Brent/0000-0002-7317-9385","NIH Office of Research Infrastructure Programs [P40 OD010440]; International C. elegans Gene Knockout Consortium; NHMRC [631634, 1068871]; NIH [R01 NS060129, GM059083, GM079097, GM088241]; ARC Future Fellowship [FT110100097]; HFSPO Fellowship [LT000762/2012]; Australian Postgraduate Award; University of Queensland Research Scholarship; ARC LIEF [LE130100078]","We thank L.

Recent studies have shown that PARylation can serve as a signal for the polyubiquitination and degradation of several crucial regulatory proteins, including Axin and 3BP2 (refs 7-9). The RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF146 (also known as Iduna) is responsible for PARylation-dependent ubiquitination (PARdU)(10-12). Here we provide a structural basis for RNF146-catalysed PARdU and how PARdU specificity is achieved. First, we show that iso-ADP-ribose (iso-ADPr), the smallest internal poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) structural unit, binds between the WWE and RING domains of RNF146 and functions as an allosteric signal that switches the RING domain from a catalytically inactive state to an active one. In the absence of PAR, the RING domain is unable to bind and activate a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) efficiently. Binding of PAR or iso-ADPr induces a major conformational change that creates a functional RING structure. Thus, RNF146 represents a new mechanistic class of RING E3 ligases, the activities of which are regulated by non-covalent ligand binding, and that may provide a template for designing inducible protein-degradation systems. Second, we find that RNF146 directly interacts with the PAR polymerase tankyrase (TNKS). Disruption of the RNF146-TNKS interaction inhibits turnover of the substrate Axin in cells. Thus, both substrate PARylation and PARdU are catalysed by enzymes within the same protein complex, and PARdU substrate specificity may be primarily determined by the substrate-TNKS interaction. We propose that the maintenance of unliganded RNF146 in an inactive state may serve to maintain the stability of the RNF146-TNKS complex, which in turn regulates the homeostasis of PARdU activity in the cell.","[DaRosa, Paul A.; Pruneda, Jonathan N.; Klevit, Rachel E.] Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [DaRosa, Paul A.; Wang, Zhizhi; Xu, Wenqing] Univ Washington, Dept Biol Struct, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Jiang, Xiaomo; Cong, Feng] Novartis Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Xu, WQ (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Biol Struct, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",klevit@uw.edu; wxu@uw.edu,"Wang, Zhizhi/K-3271-2016","Wang, Zhizhi/0000-0003-4948-925X; Xu, Wenqing/0000-0002-2884-3101","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R01 GM099766, T32 GM07270]",We thank P.

Although this observation has been reported and characterized for several different systems(3-10), the precise origin of this phenomenon is unknown. Calorimetric methods are often used to determine enthalpies from enzyme-catalysed reactions and can therefore provide important insight into their reaction mechanisms(11,12). The ensemble averages involved in traditional bulk calorimetry cannot probe the transient effects that the energy exchanged in a reaction may have on the catalyst. Here we obtain single-molecule fluorescence correlation spectroscopy data and analyse them within the framework of a stochastic theory to demonstrate a mechanistic link between the enhanced diffusion of a single enzyme molecule and the heat released in the reaction. We propose that the heat released during catalysis generates an asymmetric pressure wave that results in a differential stress at the protein-solvent interface that transiently displaces the centre-of-mass of the enzyme (chemoacoustic effect). This novel perspective on how enzymes respond to the energy released during catalysis suggests a possible effect of the heat of reaction on the structural integrity and internal degrees of freedom of the enzyme.","[Riedel, Clement; Gabizon, Ronen; Wilson, Christian A.

However, how this regulation is encoded in the messenger RNA sequence remains largely unknown. Here we uncover unique RNA regulons embedded in homeobox (Hox) 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) that confer ribosome-mediated control of gene expression. These structured RNA elements, resembling viral internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs), are found in subsets of Hox mRNAs. They facilitate ribosome recruitment and require the ribosomal protein RPL38 for their activity. Despite numerous layers of Hox gene regulation, these IRES elements are essential for converting Hox transcripts into proteins to pattern the mammalian body plan. This specialized mode of IRES-dependent translation is enabled by an additional regulatory element that we term the translation inhibitory element (TIE), which blocks cap-dependent translation of transcripts. Together, these data uncover a new paradigm for ribosome-mediated control of gene expression and organismal development.","[Xue, Shifeng; Fujii, Kotaro; Barna, Maria] Stanford Univ, Dept Dev Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Xue, Shifeng; Fujii, Kotaro; Barna, Maria] Stanford Univ, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Xue, Shifeng] Univ Calif San Francisco, Tetrad Grad Program, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Tian, Siqi; Kladwang, Wipapat; Das, Rhiju] Stanford Univ, Dept Biochem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Das, Rhiju] Stanford Univ, Dept Phys, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Barna, M (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Dev Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",mbarna@stanford.edu,,"Das, Rhiju/0000-0001-7497-0972","Agency of Science, Technology and Research of Singapore; Stanford Graduate Fellowship; Human Frontier Science Program Fellowship [NIH R01 GM102519]","We would like to thank members of the Barna laboratory and D.

Laboratory opacity measurements, however, have never been performed at stellar interior conditions, introducing uncertainties in stellar models(2-5). A particular problem arose(2,3,6-8) when refined photosphere spectral analysis(9,10) led to reductions of 30-50 per cent in the inferred amounts of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen in the Sun. Standard solar models(11) using the revised element abundances disagree with helioseismic observations that determine the internal solar structure using acoustic oscillations. This could be resolved if the true mean opacity for the solar interior matter were roughly 15 per cent higher than predicted(2,3,6-8), because increased opacity compensates for the decreased element abundances. Iron accounts for a quarter of the total opacity(2,12) at the solar radiation/convection zone boundary. Here we report measurements of wavelength-resolved iron opacity at electron temperatures of 1.9-2.3 million kelvin and electron densities of (0.7-4.0) x 10(22) per cubic centimetre, conditions very similar to those in the solar region that affects the discrepancy the most: the radiation/convection zone boundary. The measured wavelength-dependent opacity is 30-400 per cent higher than predicted. This represents roughly half the change in the mean opacity needed to resolve the solar discrepancy, even though iron is only one of many elements that contribute to opacity.","[Bailey, J.

Wind tunnel data collected under ambient and planetary-analogue conditions inform our models of aeolian processes on the terrestrial planets(3,4). However, the accuracy of these widely used formulations in predicting the threshold wind speeds required to move sand by saltation, or by short bounces, has not been tested under conditions relevant for non-terrestrial planets. Here we derive saltation threshold wind speeds under the thick-atmosphere, low-gravity and low-sediment-density conditions on Titan, using a high-pressure wind tunnel(5) refurbished to simulate the appropriate kinematic viscosity for the near-surface atmosphere of Titan. The experimentally derived saltation threshold wind speeds are higher than those predicted by models based on terrestrial-analogue experiments(6,7), indicating the limitations of these models for such extreme conditions. The models can be reconciled with the experimental results by inclusion of the extremely low ratio of particle density to fluid density(8) on Titan. Whereas the density ratio term enables accurate modelling of aeolian entrainment in thick atmospheres, such as those inferred for some extrasolar planets, our results also indicate that for environments with high density ratios, such as in jets on icy satellites or in tenuous atmospheres or exospheres, the correction for low-density-ratio conditions is not required.","[Burr, Devon M.; Emery, Joshua P.] Univ Tennessee, Earth & Planetary Sci Dept, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Bridges, Nathan T.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Space, Appl Phys Lab, Laurel, MD 20723 USA; [Marshall, John R.] SETI Inst, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA; [Smith, James K.] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [White, Bruce R.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Mech Engn, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Burr, DM (reprint author), Univ Tennessee, Earth & Planetary Sci Dept, 306 EPS Bldg,1412 Circle Dr, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",dburr1@utk.edu,"Bridges, Nathan/D-6341-2016",,NASA,"This research was supported by grants from NASA's Planetary Geology and Geophysics Program and the Outer Planets Research Program.

Observations of quantized steps in electrical conductance(2,3) have provided important insights into the physics of mesoscopic systems(4) and have allowed the development of quantum electronic devices(5). Even though quantized conductance should not rely on the presence of electric charges, it has never been observed for neutral, massive particles(6). In its most fundamental form, it requires a quantum-degenerate Fermi gas, a ballistic and adiabatic transport channel, and a constriction with dimensions comparable to the Fermi wavelength. Here we report the observation of quantized conductance in the transport of neutral atoms driven by a chemical potential bias. The atoms are in an ultra-ballistic regime, where their mean free path exceeds not only the size of the transport channel, but also the size of the entire system, including the atom reservoirs. We use high-resolution lithography to shape light potentials that realize either a quantum point contact or a quantum wire for atoms. These constrictions are imprinted on a quasi-two-dimensional ballistic channel connecting the reservoirs(7). By varying either a gate potential or the transverse confinement of the constrictions, we observe distinct plateaux in the atom conductance. The conductance in the first plateau is found to be equal to the universal conductance quantum, 1/h. We use Landauer's formula to model our results and find good agreement for low gate potentials, with all parameters determined a priori. Our experiment lets us investigate quantum conductors with wide control not only over the channel geometry, but also over the reservoir properties, such as interaction strength, size and thermalization rate.","[Krinner, Sebastian; Stadler, David; Husmann, Dominik; Brantut, Jean-Philippe; Esslinger, Tilman] ETH, Inst Quantum Elect, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland","Brantut, JP (reprint author), ETH, Inst Quantum Elect, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",brantutj@phys.ethz.ch,"Brantut, Jean-Philippe/G-2793-2013; Esslinger, Tilman/M-9022-2016","Esslinger, Tilman/0000-0002-8333-107X",SNF,"We acknowledge discussions with G.

In contrast, materials design overwhelmingly focuses on attractive interactions, such as in the many advanced polymer-based composites, where inorganic fillers interact with a polymer matrix to improve mechanical properties. However, articular cartilage strikingly illustrates how electrostatic repulsion can be harnessed to achieve unparalleled functional efficiency: it permits virtually friction-less mechanical motion within joints, even under high compression(3,4). Here we describe a composite hydrogel with anisotropic mechanical properties dominated by electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged unilamellar titanate nanosheets(5) embedded within it. Crucial to the behaviour of this hydrogel is the serendipitous discovery of cofacial nanosheet alignment in aqueous colloidal dispersions subjected to a strong magnetic field, which maximizes electrostatic repulsion(6) and thereby induces a quasi-crystalline structural ordering(7,8) over macroscopic length scales and with uniformly large face-to-face nanosheet separation. We fix this transiently induced structural order by transforming the dispersion into a hydrogel(9,10) using light-triggered in situ vinyl polymerization(11). The resultant hydrogel, containing charged inorganic structures that align cofacially in a magnetic flux(12-19), deforms easily under shear forces applied parallel to the embedded nanosheets yet resists compressive forces applied orthogonally. We anticipate that the concept of embedding anisotropic repulsive electrostatics within a composite material, inspired by articular cartilage, will open up new possibilities for developing soft materials with unusual functions.","[Liu, Mingjie; Ishida, Yasuhiro; Aida, Takuzo] RIKEN Ctr Emergent Matter Sci, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Ebina, Yasuo; Sasaki, Takayoshi] Int Ctr Mat Nanoarchitecton, Natl Inst Mat Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050044, Japan; [Hikima, Takaaki; Takata, Masaki] RIKEN SPring 8 Ctr, Sayo, Hyogo 6795198, Japan; [Aida, Takuzo] Univ Tokyo, Dept Chem & Biotechnol, Sch Engn, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138656, Japan","Ishida, Y (reprint author), RIKEN Ctr Emergent Matter Sci, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan.",y-ishida@riken.jp; aida@macro.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Ishida, Yasuhiro/I-8204-2012; Liu, Mingjie/G-1109-2010; Aida, Takuzo/I-9117-2012","Liu, Mingjie/0000-0003-0824-9858; ", [25000005],"This work was financially supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Specially Promoted Research (25000005) on ""Physically Perturbed Assembly for Tailoring High-Performance Soft Materials with Controlled Macroscopic Structural Anisotropy''.

However, the variability of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), which has a role in controlling heat transport from low to high latitudes and in ocean CO2 storage, is still poorly constrained beyond the Last Glacial Maximum(2-4). Here we show that a deep and vigorous overturning circulation mode has persisted for most of the last glacial cycle, dominating ocean circulation in the Atlantic, whereas a shallower glacial mode with southern-sourced waters filling the deep western North Atlantic prevailed during glacial maxima(3,5). Our results are based on a reconstruction of both the strength and the direction of the AMOC during the last glacial cycle from a highly resolved marine sedimentary record in the deep western North Atlantic. Parallel measurements of two independent chemical water tracers (the isotope ratios of Pa-231/Th-230 and Nd-143/Nd-144)(6-8), which are not directly affected by changes in the global cycle, reveal consistent responses of the AMOC during the last two glacial terminations. Any significant deviations from this configuration, resulting in slowdowns of the AMOC, were restricted to centennial-scale excursions during catastrophic iceberg discharges of the Heinrich stadials. Severe and multicentennial weakening of North Atlantic Deep Water formation occurred only during Heinrich stadials close to glacial maxima with increased ice coverage, probably as a result of increased freshwater input. In contrast, the AMOC was relatively insensitive to sub-millennial meltwater pulses during warmer climate states, and an active AMOC prevailed during Dansgaard-Oeschger interstadials (Greenland warm periods).","[Boehm, E.; Blaser, P.; Antz, B.; Fohlmeister, J.; Frank, N.; Deininger, M.] Heidelberg Univ, Inst Environm Phys, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Lippold, J.] Univ Bern, Inst Geol Sci, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Gutjahr, M.; Frank, M.] GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, D-24148 Kiel, Germany; [Gutjahr, M.] Natl Oceanog Ctr Southampton, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England; [Andersen, M.

In principle, the origin of both species and higher taxa among prokaryotes should entail similar mechanisms-ecological interactions with the environment paired with natural genetic variation involving lineage-specific gene innovations and lineage-specific gene acquisitions(1-4). To investigate the origin of higher taxa in archaea, we have determined gene distributions and gene phylogenies for the 267,568 protein-coding genes of 134 sequenced archaeal genomes in the context of their homologues from 1,847 reference bacterial genomes. Archaeal-specific gene families define 13 traditionally recognized archaeal higher taxa in our sample. Here we report that the origins of these 13 groups unexpectedly correspond to 2,264 group-specific gene acquisitions from bacteria. Interdomain gene transfer is highly asymmetric, transfers from bacteria to archaea are more than fivefold more frequent than vice versa. Gene transfers identified at major evolutionary transitions among prokaryotes specifically implicate gene acquisitions for metabolic functions from bacteria as key innovations in the origin of higher archaeal taxa.","[Nelson-Sathi, Shijulal; Sousa, Filipa L.; Roettger, Mayo; Lozada-Chavez, Nabor; Thiergart, Thorsten; Martin, William F.] Univ Dusseldorf, Inst Mol Evolut, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany; [Janssen, Arnold] Univ Dusseldorf, Math Inst, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany; [Bryant, David] Univ Otago, Dept Math & Stat, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand; [Landan, Giddy] Univ Kiel, Genom Microbiol Grp, Inst Microbiol, D-24118 Kiel, Germany; [Schoenheit, Peter] Univ Kiel, Inst Allgemeine Mikrobiol, D-24118 Kiel, Germany; [Siebers, Bettina] Univ Duisburg Essen, Fac Chem, Biofilm Ctr, D-45117 Essen, Germany; [McInerney, James O.] Natl Univ Ireland, Dept Biol, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland; [Martin, William F.] Univ Nova Lisboa, Inst Tecnol Quim & Biol, P-2780157 Oeiras, Portugal","Martin, WF (reprint author), Univ Dusseldorf, Inst Mol Evolut, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany.",bill@hhu.de,"Sousa, Filipa/H-6192-2012; Martin, William /O-5446-2015","Sousa, Filipa/0000-0002-4075-1701; Martin, William /0000-0003-1478-6449; Landan, Giddy/0000-0002-2502-8750; Nelson-Sathi, Shijulal/0000-0002-3346-0383","European Research Council (ERC) [232975, 281357]; graduate school E-Norm of the Heinrich-Heine University; DFG [Scho 316/11-1, SI 642/10-1]; BMBF [0316188A]","We gratefully acknowledge funding from European Research Council (ERC 232975 to W.

Procr-expressing cells have a high regenerative capacity in transplantation assays and differentiate into all lineages of the mammary epithelium by lineage tracing. These results define a novel multipotent mammary stem cell population that could be important in the initiation of breast cancer.","[Wang, Daisong; Cai, Cheguo; Dong, Xiaobing; Yu, Qing Cissy; Zeng, Yi Arial] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Cell Biol, Inst Biochem & Cell Biol, Shanghai Inst Biol Sci, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiao-Ou; Yang, Li] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Computat Biol, CAS MPG Partner Inst Computat Biol, Shanghai Inst Biol Sci, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China","Zeng, YA (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Cell Biol, Inst Biochem & Cell Biol, Shanghai Inst Biol Sci, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China.",yzeng@sibcb.ac.cn,,"Zhang, Xiao-Ou/0000-0002-2027-1313",,,,27,72,75,10,64,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,1-Jan,2015,517,7532,,,,,81,U201,,10.1038/nature13851,,16,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,AX8SI,WOS:000347178400039,25327250,No,,,11/20/17

It differs radically from other picornaviruses, existing in an enveloped form(2) and being unusually stable, both genetically and physically(3), but has proved difficult to study. Here we report high-resolution X-ray structures for the mature virus and the empty particle. The structures of the two particles are indistinguishable, apart from some disorder on the inside of the empty particle. The full virus contains the small viral protein VP4, whereas the empty particle harbours only the uncleaved precursor, VP0. The smooth particle surface is devoid of depressions that might correspond to receptor-binding sites. Peptide scanning data extend the previously reported VP3 antigenic site4, while structure-based predictions(5) suggest further epitopes. HAV contains no pocket factor and can withstand remarkably high temperature and low pH, and empty particles are even more robust than full particles. The virus probably uncoats via a novel mechanism, being assembled differently to other picornaviruses. It utilizes a VP2 'domain swap' characteristic of insect picorna-like viruses(6,7), and structure-based phylogenetic analysis places HAV between typical picornaviruses and the insect viruses. The enigmatic properties of HAV may reflect its position as a link between 'modern' picornaviruses and the more 'primitive' precursor insect viruses; for instance, HAV retains the ability to move from cell-to-cell by transcytosis(8,9).","[Wang, Xiangxi; Gao, Qiang; Sun, Yao; Li, Xuemei; Rao, Zihe] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Biophys, Natl Lab Macromol, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Ren, Jingshan; Stuart, David I.; Fry, Elizabeth E.] Univ Oxford, Div Struct Biol, Oxford OX3 7BN, England; [Gao, Qiang; Yin, Weidong] Sinovac Biotech Co Ltd, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China; [Hu, Zhongyu; Wang, Junzhi] Natl Inst Food & Drug Control, Beijing 100050, Peoples R China; [Rowlands, David J.] Univ Leeds, Inst Mol & Cellular Biol, Fac Biol Sci, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Rowlands, David J.] Univ Leeds, Astbury Ctr Struct Mol Biol, Fac Biol Sci, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Stuart, David I.] Diamond Light Sources, Didcot OX11 0DE, Oxon, England; [Rao, Zihe] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Med, Struct Biol Lab, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Rao, Zihe] Nankai Univ, State Key Lab Med Chem Biol, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China","Stuart, DI (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Div Struct Biol, Henry Wellcome Bldg Genomic Med, Oxford OX3 7BN, England.",wangjz@nicpbp.org.cn; dave@strubi.ox.ac.uk; raozh@xtal.tsinghua.edu.cn,,"Fry, Elizabeth/0000-0001-9754-5303",Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB08020200]; Ministry of Science and Technology 973 Project [2014CB542800]; National Major Project of Infectious Disease [2012ZX10004701]; National Science Foundation [81330036],"This work was supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academyof Sciences, grant no.

We previously published a study describing humans with inherited ISG15deficiency but without unusually severe viral diseases(5). We showed that these patients were prone to mycobacterial disease and that human ISG15 was non-redundant as an extracellular IFN-gamma-inducing molecule. We show here that ISG15-deficient patients also display unanticipated cellular, immunological and clinical signs of enhanced IFN-alpha/beta immunity, reminiscent of the Mendelian autoinflammatory interferonopathies Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome and spondyloenchondrodysplasia(6-9). We further show that an absence of intracellular ISG15 in the patients' cells prevents the accumulation of USP18(10,11), a potent negative regulator of IFN-alpha/beta signalling, resulting in the enhancement and amplification of IFN-alpha/beta responses. Human ISG15, therefore, is not only redundant for antiviral immunity, but is a key negative regulator of IFN-alpha/beta immunity. In humans, intracellular ISG15 is IFN-alpha/beta-inducible not to serve as a substrate for ISGylation-dependent antiviral immunity, but to ensure USP18-dependent regulation of IFN-alpha/beta and prevention of IFN-alpha/beta-dependent autoinflammation.","[Zhang, Xianqin;

Phosphatase activity must subsequently be restored to promote mitotic exit. Although Cdc14 phosphatase drives this reversal in budding yeast, protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activities have each been independently linked to mitotic exit control in other eukaryotes(1-6). Here we describe a mitotic phosphatase relay in which PP1 reactivation is required for the reactivation of both PP2A-B55 and PP2A-B56 to coordinate mitotic progression and exit in fission yeast. The staged recruitment of PP1 (the Dis2 isoform) to the regulatory sub-units of the PP2A-B55 and PP2A-B56 (B55 also known as Pab1; B56 also known as Par1) holoenzymes sequentially activates each phosphatase. The pathway is blocked in early mitosis because the Cdk1-cyclin B kinase (Cdk1 also known as Cdc2) inhibits PP1 activity, but declining cyclin B levels later in mitosis permit PP1 to auto-reactivate(1,7-10). PP1 first reactivates PP2A-B55; this enables PP2A-B55 in turn to promote the reactivation of PP2A-B56 by dephosphorylating a PP1-docking site in PP2A-B56, thereby promoting the recruitment of PP1. PP1 recruitment to human, mitotic PP2A-B56 holoenzymes and the sequences of these conserved PP1-docking motifs(11,12) suggest that PP1 regulates PP2A-B55 and PP2A-B56 activities in a variety of signalling contexts throughout eukaryotes.","[Grallert, Agnes; Boke, Elvan; Hodgson, Ben; Hagan, Iain M.] Univ Manchester, CRUK Manchester Inst, Cell Div Grp, Manchester M20 4BX, Lancs, England; [Hagting, Anja; Pines, Jonathon] Univ Cambridge, Gurdon Inst, Cambridge CB2 1QN, England; [Connolly, Yvonne; Griffiths, John R.; Smith, Duncan L.] Univ Manchester, CRUK Manchester Inst, Manchester M20 4BX, Lancs, England","Hagan, IM (reprint author), Univ Manchester, CRUK Manchester Inst, Cell Div Grp, Wilmslow Rd, Manchester M20 4BX, Lancs, England.",Iain.Hagan@cruk.manchester.ac.uk,"Boke, Elvan/O-6725-2017","Hagan, Iain/0000-0002-5858-9415; Pines, Jonathon/0000-0002-5227-6004; Grallert, Agnes/0000-0002-0127-3495","Cancer Research UK (CRUK) [C147/A16406, C29/A13678]","This work was supported by Cancer Research UK (CRUK) grant numbers C147/A16406 and C29/A13678.

The initial reaction of photosynthesis takes place in photosystem II (PSII), a 700-kilodalton homodimeric membrane protein complex that catalyses photo-oxidation of water into dioxygen through an S-state cycle of the oxygen evolving complex (OEC). The structure of PSII has been solved by X-ray diffraction (XRD) at 1.9 angstrom resolution, which revealed that the OEC is a Mn4CaO5-cluster coordinated by a well defined protein environment(1). However, extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) studies showed that the manganese cations in the OEC are easily reduced by X-ray irradiation(2), and slight differences were found in the Mn-Mn distances determined by XRD1, EXAFS(3-7) and theoretical studies(8-14). Here we report a 'radiation-damage-free' structure of PSII from Thermosynechococcus vulcanus in the S-1 state at a resolution of 1.95 angstroms using femtosecond X-ray pulses of the SPring-8 angstrom compact free-electron laser (SACLA) and hundreds of large, highly isomorphous PSII crystals. Compared with the structure from XRD, the OEC in the X-ray free electron laser structure has Mn-Mn distances that are shorter by 0.1-0.2 angstroms. The valences of each manganese atom were tentatively assigned as Mn1D(III), Mn2C(IV), Mn3B(IV) and Mn4A(III), based on the average Mn-ligand distances and analysis of the Jahn-Teller axis on Mn(III). One of the oxo-bridged oxygens, O5, has significantly longer distances to Mn than do the other oxo-oxygen atoms, suggesting that O5 is a hydroxide ion instead of a normal oxygen dianion and therefore may serve as one of the substrate oxygen atoms. These findings provide a structural basis for the mechanism of oxygen evolution, and we expect that this structure will provide a blueprint for the design of artificial catalysts for water oxidation.","[Suga, Michihiro; Akita, Fusamichi; Nakajima, Yoshiki; Shimizu, Tetsuya; Shen, Jian-Ren] Okayama Univ, Grad Sch Nat Sci & Technol, Photosynth Res Ctr, Okayama 7008530, Japan; [Hirata, Kunio; Ueno, Go; Murakami, Hironori; Yamashita, Keitaro; Yamamoto, Masaki; Ago, Hideo] RIKEN, SPring Ctr 8, Mikazuki, Hyogo 6795148, Japan; [Hirata, Kunio] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy JST, Core Res Evolut Sci & Technol CREST, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan","Ago, H (reprint author), RIKEN, SPring Ctr 8, 1-1-1 Kouto Sayo, Mikazuki, Hyogo 6795148, Japan.",yamamoto@riken.jp; ago@spring8.or.jp; shen@cc.okayama-u.ac.jp,"Yamamoto, Masaki/B-7844-2015; Akita, Fusamichi/C-2034-2015; Suga, Michi/C-2870-2015; Shen, Jian-Ren/B-2558-2011","Yamamoto, Masaki/0000-0002-1311-1768; Akita, Fusamichi/0000-0003-0537-6157; ","The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan, MEXT; JST/CREST; Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute (JASRI) [2012A8011, 2012B8040, 2013A8047, 2013B8052, 2014A8036]","We thank T.

Sterol reductases(1) including Delta(14)-sterol reductase (C14SR, also known as TM7SF2), 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR7) and 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR24) reduce specific carbon-carbon double bonds of the sterol moiety using a reducing cofactor during sterol biosynthesis. Lamin B receptor(2) (LBR), an integral inner nuclear membrane protein, also contains a functional C14SR domain. Here we report the crystal structure of a Delta(14)-sterol reductase (MaSR1) from the methanotrophic bacterium Methylomicro-bium alcaliphilum 20Z (a homologue of human C14SR, LBR and DHCR7) with the cofactor NADPH. The enzyme contains ten transmembrane segments (TM1-10). Its catalytic domain comprises the carboxy-terminal half (containing TM6-10) and envelops two interconnected pockets, one of which faces the cytoplasm and houses NADPH, while the other one is accessible from the lipid bilayer. Comparison with a soluble steroid 5 beta-reductase structure(3) suggests that the reducing end of NADPH meets the sterol substrate at the juncture of the two pockets. A sterol reductase activity assay proves that MaSR1 can reduce the double bond of a cholesterol biosynthetic intermediate, demonstrating functional conservation to human C14SR. Therefore, our structure as a prototype of integral membrane sterol reductases provides molecular insight into mutations in DHCR7 and LBR for inborn human diseases.","[Li, Xiaochun; Blobel, Guenter] Rockefeller Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Lab Cell Biol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Roberti, Rita] Univ Perugia, Dept Expt Med, I-06132 Perugia, Italy","Li, XC (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Lab Cell Biol, New York, NY 10065 USA.",xli05@rockefeller.edu; blobel@rockefeller.edu,,"ROBERTI, Rita/0000-0003-4131-5933",Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NIGMS NIH HHS [P41 GM111244],,,36,9,10,2,22,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,1-Jan,2015,517,7532,,,,,104,U280,,10.1038/nature13797,,15,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,AX8SI,WOS:000347178400044,25307054,No,,,11/20/17

The development of new methods to create these essential connections in a rapid and practical fashion has been the focus of numerous organic chemists. This endeavour relies heavily on the ability to form C-C bonds in the presence of sensitive functional groups and congested structural environments. Here we report a chemical transformation that allows the facile construction of highly substituted and uniquely functionalized C-C bonds. Using a simple iron catalyst, an inexpensive silane and a benign solvent under ambient atmosphere, heteroatom-substituted olefins are easily reacted with electron-deficient olefins to create molecular architectures that were previously difficult or impossible to access. More than 60 examples are presented with a wide array of substrates, demonstrating the chemoselectivity and mildness of this simple reaction.","[Lo, Julian C.; Gui, Jinghan; Yabe, Yuki; Pan, Chung-Mao; Baran, Phil S.] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Chem, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Baran, PS (reprint author), Scripps Res Inst, Dept Chem, 10550 North Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",pbaran@scripps.edu,,"Gui, Jinghan/0000-0002-4786-5779",NIH/NIGMS [GM-097444]; National Science Foundation; Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry; Zhejiang Medicine Co.; Pharmaron; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science,"Financial support for this work was provided by NIH/NIGMS (GM-097444).

Although AUTS2 is often disrupted in patients with neuronal disorders, the mechanism underlying the pathogenesis is unclear. We investigated the role of AUTS2 as part of a previously identified PRC1 complex (PRC1-AUTS2), and in the context of neurodevelopment. In contrast to the canonical role of PRC1 in gene repression, PRC1-AUTS2 activates transcription. Biochemical studies demonstrate that the CK2 component of PRC1-AUTS2 neutralizes PRC1 repressive activity, whereas AUTS2-mediated recruitment of P300 leads to gene activation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) demonstrated that AUTS2 regulates neuronal gene expression through promoter association. Conditional targeting of Auts2 in the mouse central nervous system (CNS) leads to various developmental defects.

The PA endonuclease and the PB2 cap-binding domain, involved in transcription by cap-snatching, form protrusions facing each other across a solvent channel. The 59 extremity of the promoter folds into a compact hook that is bound in a pocket formed by PB1 and PA close to the polymerase active site.

By contrast, genome replication is unprimed and generates exact full-length copies of the template. Here we use crystal structures of bat influenza A and human influenza B polymerases (FluA and FluB), bound to the viral RNA promoter, to give mechanistic insight into these distinct processes. In the FluA structure, a loop analogous to the priming loop of flavivirus polymerases suggests that influenza could initiate unprimed template replication by a similar mechanism. Comparing the FluA and FluB structures suggests that cap-snatching involves in situ rotation of the PB2 cap-binding domain to direct the capped primer first towards the endonuclease and then into the polymerase active site. The polymerase probably undergoes considerable conformational changes to convert the observed pre-initiation state into the active initiation and elongation states.","[Reich, Stefan; Guilligay, Delphine; Pflug, Alexander; Malet, Helene; Berger, Imre; Hart, Darren; Lunardi, Thomas; Nanao, Max; Cusack, Stephen] European Mol Biol Lab, Grenoble Outstn, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France; [Reich, Stefan; Guilligay, Delphine; Pflug, Alexander; Malet, Helene; Berger, Imre; Crepin, Thibaut; Hart, Darren; Lunardi, Thomas; Nanao, Max; Ruigrok, Rob W.

The extended main-sequence turn-off regions-containing stars leaving the main sequence after having spent all of the hydrogen in their cores-found in massive (more than a few tens of thousands of solar masses), intermediate-age (about one to three billion years old) star clusters1-8 are usually interpreted as evidence of internal age spreads of more than 300 million years(2,4,5), although young clusters are thought to quickly lose any remaining star-forming fuel following a period of rapid gas expulsion on timescales of order 10(7) years(9,10). Here we report, on the basis of a combination of high-resolution imaging observations and theoretical modelling, that the stars beyond the main sequence in the two-billion-year-old cluster NGC 1651, characterized by a mass of about 1.7 x 10(5) solar masses(3), can be explained only by a single-age stellar population, even though the cluster has a clearly extended main-sequence turn-off region. The most plausible explanation for the existence of such extended regions invokes a population of rapidly rotating stars, although the secondary effects of the prolonged stellar lifetimes associated with such a stellar population mixture are as yet poorly understood. From preliminary analysis of previously obtained data, we find that similar morphologies are apparent in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams of at least five additional intermediate-age star clusters(2,3,5,11), suggesting that an extended main-sequence turn-off region does not necessarily imply the presence of a significant internal age dispersion.","[Li, Chengyuan; de Grijs, Richard] Peking Univ, Kavli Inst Astron & Astrophys, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Li, Chengyuan; de Grijs, Richard] Peking Univ, Dept Astron, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Li, Chengyuan; Deng, Licai] Chinese Acad Sci, Natl Astron Observ, Key Lab Opt Astron, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China","Li, CY (reprint author), Peking Univ, Kavli Inst Astron & Astrophys, Yi He Yuan Lu 5, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",joshuali@pku.edu.cn,,"de Grijs, Richard/0000-0002-7203-5996; Li, Chengyuan/0000-0002-3084-5157","National Natural Science Foundation of China [11073001, 11373010, 11473037]","We thank S. de Mink, Y.

For devices to be useful, such control must be achieved at room temperature. The only single-phase multiferroic material exhibiting unambiguous magnetoelectric coupling at room temperature is BiFeO3 (refs 4 and 5). Its weak ferromagnetism arises from the canting of the antiferromagnetically aligned spins by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction(6-9). Prior theory considered the symmetry of the thermodynamic ground state and concluded that direct 180-degree switching of the DM vector by the ferroelectric polarization was forbidden(10,11). Instead, we examined the kinetics of the switching process, something not considered previously in theoretical work(10-12). Here we show a deterministic reversal of the DM vector and canted moment using an electric field at room temperature. First-principles calculations reveal that the switching kinetics favours a two-step switching process. In each step the DM vector and polarization are coupled and 180-degree deterministic switching of magnetization hence becomes possible, in agreement with experimental observation. We exploit this switching to demonstrate energy-efficient control of a spin-valve device at room temperature. The energy per unit area required is approximately an order of magnitude less than that needed for spin-transfer torque switching(13,14). Given that the DM interaction is fundamental to singlephase multiferroics and magnetoelectrics(3,9), our results suggest ways to engineer magnetoelectric switching and tailor technologically pertinent functionality for nanometre-scale, low-energy-consumption, non-volatile magnetoelectronics.","[Heron, J.

However, there is no exact solution for the quantum three-body problem, and as a result even the minimal system of two active electrons and a nucleus is analytically intractable(4). This makes experimental measurements of the dynamics of two bound and correlated electrons, as found in the helium atom, an attractive prospect. However, although the motion of single active electrons and holes has been observed with attosecond time resolution(5-7), comparable experiments on two-electron motion have so far remained out of reach. Here we show that a correlated two-electron wave packet can be reconstructed from a 1.2-femtosecond quantum beat among low-lying doubly excited states in helium. The beat appears in attosecond transient-absorption spectra(5,7-9) measured with unprecedentedly high spectral resolution and in the presence of an intensity-tunable visible laser field. We tune the coupling(10-12) between the two low-lying quantum states by adjusting the visible laser intensity, and use the Fano resonance as a phase-sensitive quantum interferometer(13) to achieve coherent control of the two correlated electrons. Given the excellent agreement with large-scalequantum-mechanical calculations for the helium atom, we anticipate that multidimensional spectroscopy experiments of the type we report here will provide benchmark data for testing fundamental few-body quantum dynamics theory in more complex systems. They might also provide a route to the site-specific measurement and control of metastable electronic transition states that are at the heart of fundamental chemical reactions.","[Ott, Christian; Kaldun, Andreas; Raith, Philipp; Meyer, Kristina; Laux, Martin; Zhang, Yizhu; Blaettermann, Alexander; Hagstotz, Steffen; Ding, Thomas; Heck, Robert; Pfeifer, Thomas] Max Planck Inst Kernphys, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Argenti, Luca; Martin, Fernando] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Quim, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Madronero, Javier] Tech Univ Munich, Phys Dept, D-85747 Garching, Germany; [Martin, Fernando] Inst Madrileno Estudios Avanzados Nanociencia, Madrid 28049, Spain; [Pfeifer, Thomas] Heidelberg Univ, Ctr Quantum Dynam, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany","Pfeifer, T (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Kernphys, Saupfercheckweg 1, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany.",fernando.martin@uam.es; thomas.pfeifer@mpi-hd.mpg.de,"Martin, Fernando/C-3972-2014; Zhang, Yizhu/C-3519-2013","Martin, Fernando/0000-0002-7529-925X; Zhang, Yizhu/0000-0003-2158-6541; Argenti, Luca/0000-0003-1093-4379","Max Planck Research Group Program of the Max Planck Gesellschaft (MPG); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [PF 790/1-1]; European COST Action [CM1204 XLIC]; European Research Council [290853 XCHEM]; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [FIS2010-15127, FIS2013-42002-R, ERA-Chemistry PIM2010EEC-00751]; European grant MC-ITN CORINF","We thank E.

According to the Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 adopted by the Convention on Biological Diversity, the protected area network should be expanded to at least 17% of the terrestrial world by 2020 (http://www.cbd.int/sp/targets). To maximize conservation outcomes, it is crucial to identify the best expansion areas. Here we show that there is a very high potential to increase protection of ecoregions and vertebrate species by expanding the protected area network, but also identify considerable risk of ineffective outcomes due to land-use change and uncoordinated actions between countries. We use distribution data for 24,757 terrestrial vertebrates assessed under the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) 'red list of threatened species' 9, and terrestrial ecoregions(10) (827), modified by land-use models for the present and 2040, and introduce techniques for global and balanced spatial conservation prioritization. First, we show that with a coordinated global protected area network expansion to 17% of terrestrial land, average protection of species ranges and ecoregions could triple. Second, if projected land-use change by 2040 (ref. 11) takes place, it becomes infeasible to reach the currently possible protection levels, and over 1,000 threatened species would lose more than 50% of their present effective ranges worldwide. Third, we demonstrate a major efficiency gap between national and global conservation priorities. Strong evidence is shown that further biodiversity loss is unavoidable unless international action is quickly taken to balance land-use and biodiversity conservation. The approach used here can serve as a framework for repeatable and quantitative assessment of efficiency, gaps and expansion of the global protected area network globally, regionally andnationally, considering current and projected land-use pressures.","[Pouzols, Federico Montesino; Toivonen, Tuuli; Di Minin, Enrico; Kukkala, Aija S.; Kullberg, Peter; Kuustera, Johanna; Lehtomaki, Joona; Moilanen, Atte] Univ Helsinki, Dept Biosci, Finnish Ctr Excellence Metapopulat Biol, Bioctr, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Toivonen, Tuuli] Univ Helsinki, Dept Geosci & Geog, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Di Minin, Enrico] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Dept Life Sci, ZA-4000 Durban, South Africa; [Kuustera, Johanna] Reg Council Helsinki Uusimaa, FI-00240 Helsinki, Finland; [Verburg, Peter H.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands","Pouzols, FM (reprint author), Rutherford Appleton Lab, Sci & Technol Facil Council, Harwell Oxford Campus, Didcot OX11 0QX, Oxon, England.",federico.montesino-pouzols@stfc.ac.uk; tuuli.toivonen@helsinki.fi; atte.moilanen@helsinki.fi,"; Montesino Pouzols, Federico/D-7995-2014; Kukkala, Aija/B-7962-2015; Di Minin, Enrico/J-6904-2013; Moilanen, Atte/A-5005-2011; Verburg, Peter/A-8469-2010","Toivonen, Tuuli/0000-0002-6625-4922; Montesino Pouzols, Federico/0000-0002-2981-5612; Kukkala, Aija/0000-0003-0812-8722; Di Minin, Enrico/0000-0002-5562-318X; Verburg, Peter/0000-0002-6977-7104; Lehtomaki, Joona/0000-0002-7891-0843; Tenkanen, Henrikki/0000-0002-0918-4710",European Research Council Starting Grant (ERC-StG) [260393]; Academy of Finland centre of excellence programme; Natural Heritage Services (Metsahallitus); ERC [311819]; CSC-IT Center for Science Ltd,"F.M.P., T.T., E.D.M., A.S.K., P.K., J.L. and A.M. thank the European Research Council Starting Grant (ERC-StG) 260393 (Global Environmental Decision Analysis, GEDA), the Academy of Finland centre of excellence programme 2012-2017 and the Natural Heritage Services (Metsahallitus) for support.

How these vectors persist over the 3-6-month long dry season has not been resolved, despite extensive research for over a century(1-3.) Hypotheses for vector persistence include dry-season diapause (aestivation) and long-distance migration (LDM); both are facets of vector biology that have been highly controversial owing to lack of concrete evidence. Here we show that certain species persist by a form of aestivation, while others engage in LDM. Using time-series analyses, the seasonal cycles of Anopheles coluzzii, Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto (s.s.), and Anopheles arabiensis were estimated, and their effects were found to be significant, stable and highly species-specific. Contrary to all expectations, the most complex dynamics occurred during the dry season, when the density of A. coluzzii fluctuated markedly, peaking when migration would seem highly unlikely, whereas A. gambiae s.s. was undetected. The population growth of A. coluzzii followed the first rains closely, consistent with aestivation, whereas the growth phase of both A. gambiae s.s. and A. arabiensis lagged by two months. Such a delay is incompatible with local persistence, but fits LDM. Surviving the long dry season in situ allows A. coluzzii to predominate and form the primary force of malaria transmission. Our results reveal profound ecological divergence between A. coluzzii and A. gambiae s.s., whose standing as distinct species has been challenged, and suggest that climate is one of the selective pressures that led to their speciation. Incorporating vector dormancy and LDM is key to predicting shifts in the range of malaria due to global climate change(4), and to the elimination of malaria from Africa.","[Dao, A.; Yaro, A.

While the fin-to-limb transition has received considerable attention(1,2), little is known about the developmental and evolutionary origins of external genitalia. Similarities in gene expression have been interpreted as a potential evolutionary link between the limb and genitals(3-6); however, no underlying developmental mechanism has been identified. We re-examined this question using micro-computed tomography, lineage tracing in three amniote clades, and RNA-sequencing-based transcriptional profiling. Here we show that the developmental origin of external genitalia has shifted through evolution, and in some taxa limbs and genitals share a common primordium. In squamates, the genitalia develop directly from the budding hindlimbs, or the remnants thereof, whereas in mice the genital tubercle originates from the ventral and tail bud mesenchyme. The recruitment of different cell populations for genital outgrowth follows a change in the relative position of the cloaca, the genitalia organizing centre. Ectopic grafting of the cloaca demonstrates the conserved ability of different mesenchymal cells to respond to these genitalia-inducing signals. Our results support a limb-like developmental origin of external genitalia as the ancestral condition. Moreover, they suggest that a change in the relative position of the cloacal signalling centre during evolution has led to an altered developmental route for external genitalia in mammals, while preserving parts of the ancestral limb molecular circuitry owing to a common evolutionary origin.","[Tschopp, Patrick; Aspiras, Ariel C.; Hu, Jimmy K.; Pourquie, Olivier; Tabin, Clifford J.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Sherratt, Emma; Sanger, Thomas J.] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Groner, Anna C.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Pourquie, Olivier] IGBMC, F-67400 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France; [Pourquie, Olivier] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Gros, Jerome] Inst Pasteur, Dev & Stem Cell Biol Dept, F-75724 Paris 15, France","Tabin, CJ (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",jgros@pasteur.fr; tabin@genetics.med.harvard.edu,"Sherratt, Emma/A-9931-2011","Sherratt, Emma/0000-0003-2164-7877; Gros, Jerome/0000-0002-2264-2851; Pourquie, Olivier/0000-0001-5189-1227",National Science Foundation [ECS-0335765]; Swiss National Science Foundation; EMBO; Human Frontiers Science Program; National Institutes of Health [R37-HD032443],"The authors thank D.

Following exposure to cold, BAT is activated by the sympathetic nervous system with concomitant release of catecholamines and activation of beta-adrenergic receptors(1-5). Because BAT therapies based on cold exposureor beta-adrenergic agonists are clinically not feasible, alternative strategies must be explored. Purinergic co-transmission might be involved in sympathetic control of BAT and previous studies reported inhibitory effects of the purinergic transmitter adenosine in BAT from hamster or rat(6-8). However, the role of adenosine in human BAT is unknown. Here we show that adenosine activates human and murine brown adipocytes at low nanomolar concentrations. Adenosine is released in BAT during stimulation of sympathetic nerves as well as from brown adipocytes. The adenosine A(2A) receptor is the most abundant adenosine receptor in human and murine BAT. Pharmacological blockade or genetic loss of A(2A) receptors in mice causes adecrease in BAT-dependent thermogenesis, whereas treatment with A(2A) agonists significantly increases energy expenditure. Moreover, pharmacological stimulation of A(2A) receptors or injection of lentiviral vectors expressing the A(2A) receptor into white fat induces brown-like cells-so-called beige adipocytes. Importantly, mice fed a high-fat diet and treated with an A(2A) agonist are leaner with improved glucose tolerance. Taken together, our results demonstrate that adenosine-A(2A) signalling plays an unexpected physiological role in sympathetic BAT activation and protects mice from diet-induced obesity. Those findings reveal new possibilities for developing novel obesity therapies.","[Gnad, Thorsten; Scheibler, Saskia; von Kuegelgen, Ivar; Kilic, Ana; Gloede, Anja; Hoffmann, Linda S.; Reverte-Salisa, Laia; Horn, Philipp; Mutlu, Samet; Pfeifer, Alexander] Univ Bonn, Univ Hosp, Inst Pharmacol & Toxicol, D-53127 Bonn, Germany; [Scheibler, Saskia; Reverte-Salisa, Laia] Univ Bonn, Res Training Grp 1873, D-53127 Bonn, Germany; [Scheele, Camilla] Rigshosp, Ctr Inflammat & Metab, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Scheele, Camilla] Rigshosp, Ctr Phys Activ Res, Dept Infect Dis, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [El-Tayeb, Ali; Mueller, Christa E.] Univ Bonn, Inst Pharmaceut, D-53121 Bonn, Germany; [Kranz, Mathias; Deuther-Conrad, Winnie; Brust, Peter] Helmholtz Zentrum Dresden Rossendorf, Inst Radiopharmaceut Canc Res, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Lidell, Martin E.; Betz, Matthias J.; Enerbaeck, Sven] Univ Gothenburg, Sahlgrenska Acad, Inst Biomed, Dept Med & Clin Genet, S-41390 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Schrader, Juergen] Univ Dusseldorf, Dept Mol Cardiol, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany; [Yegutkin, Gennady G.] Univ Turku, Med Res Lab, FIN-20520 Turku, Finland; [Mueller, Christa E.; Pfeifer, Alexander] Univ Bonn, Pharma Ctr, D-53127 Bonn, Germany","Pfeifer, A (reprint author), Univ Bonn, Univ Hosp, Inst Pharmacol & Toxicol, D-53127 Bonn, Germany.",alexander.pfeifer@uni-bonn.de,"Deuther-Conrad, Winnie/B-7558-2015; Muller, Christa/C-7748-2014; Scheele, Camilla/S-6401-2017","Muller, Christa/0000-0002-0013-6624; Scheele, Camilla/0000-0002-6055-9709; Yegutkin, Gennady/0000-0001-6684-7982","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG); Lundbeck Foundation; Novo Nordisk A/S; Danish National Research Foundation [DNRF55]; Trygfonden; BONFOR; Bonn International Graduate School DrugS; Swedish Research Council [2013-4466, 2010-3281, 2012-1652]; Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation; Sahlgrenska's University Hospital (LUA-ALF); European Union [HEALTH-F2-2011-278373]; Inga Britt and Arne Lundgren Foundation; Soderberg Foundation; King Gustaf V and Queen Victoria Freemason Foundation; Federal Ministry of Education and research","We thank D.

Species differences in embryonic development and architecture of the adult stomach make animal models suboptimal for studying human stomach organogenesis and pathogenesis(4), and there is no experimental model of normal human gastric mucosa. Here we report the de novo generation of three-dimensional human gastric tissue in vitro through the directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells. We show that temporal manipulation of the FGF, WNT, BMP, retinoic acid and EGF signalling pathways and three-dimensional growth are sufficient to generate human gastric organoids (hGOs). Developing hGOs progressed through molecular and morphogenetic stages that were nearly identical to the developing antrum of the mouse stomach. Organoids formed primitive gastric gland-and pit-like domains, proliferative zones containing LGR5-expressing cells, surface and antral mucous cells, and a diversity of gastric endocrine cells. We used hGO cultures to identify novel signalling mechanisms that regulate early endoderm patterning and gastric endocrine cell differentiation upstream of the transcription factor NEUROG3. UsinghGOs to model pathogenesis of human disease, we found that H. pylori infection resulted in rapid association of the virulence factor CagA with the c-Met receptor, activation of signalling and induction of epithelial proliferation. Together, these studies describe a new and robust in vitro system for elucidating the mechanisms underlying human stomach development and disease.","[McCracken, Kyle W.; Cata, Emily M.; Crawford, Calyn M.; Sinagoga, Katie L.; Mayhew, Christopher N.; Wells, James M.] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Dev Biol, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Schumacher, Michael; Zavros, Yana] Univ Cincinnati, Dept Mol & Cellular Physiol, Cincinnati, OH 45267 USA; [Rockich, Briana E.; Spence, Jason R.] Univ Michigan, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Sch Med, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Tsai, Yu-Hwai; Spence, Jason R.] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Wells, James M.] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Endocrinol, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA","Wells, JM (reprint author), Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Dev Biol, 3333 Burnet Ave, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA.",zavrosya@ucmail.uc.edu; james.wells@cchmc.org,,,"National Institutes of Health [R01DK080823, R01DK092456, K01DK091415]; NIGMS Medical Scientist Training Program [T32 GM063483]; American Gastroenterological Association: Robert and Sally Funderburg Research Award in Gastric Cancer; Cincinnati Digestive Disease Center Award [P30 DK0789392]; Clinical Translational Science Award [U54 RR025216]; Michigan Gastrointestinal Peptide Research Center (MGPRC) [NIDDK 5P30DK034933]","We thank A.

While such cells are readily derived from mouse blastocysts it has not been possible to isolate human equivalents easily(1,2), although human naive-like cells have been artificially generated (rather than extracted) by coercion of human primed embryonic stem cells by modifying culture conditions(2-4) or through transgenic modification(5). Here we show that a sub-population within cultures of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) manifests key properties of naive state cells. These naive-like cells can be genetically tagged, and are associated with elevated transcription of HERVH, a primate-specific endogenous retrovirus. HERVH elements provide functional binding sites for a combination of naive pluripotency transcription factors, including LBP9, recently recognized as relevant to naivety inmice(6).

The inner nuclear membrane (INM) functions in essential nuclear processes including chromatin organization and regulation of gene expression(1). The outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum and is the site of membrane protein synthesis. Protein homeostasis in this compartment is ensured by endoplasmic-reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) pathways that in yeast involve the integral membrane E3 ubiquitin ligases Hrd1 and Doa10 operating with the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes Ubc6 and Ubc7 (refs 2, 3). However, little is known about protein quality control at the INM. Here we describe a protein degradation pathway at the INM in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) mediated by the Asicomplex consisting of the RING domain proteins Asi1 and Asi3 (ref. 4). We report that the Asi complex functions together with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes Ubc6 and Ubc7 to degrade soluble and integral membrane proteins. Genetic evidence suggests that the Asi ubiquitin ligase defines a pathway distinct from, but complementary to, ERAD. Using unbiased screening with a novel genome-wide yeast library based on a tandem fluorescent protein timer(5), we identify more than 50 substrates of the Asi, Hrd1 and Doa10 E3 ubiquitin ligases. We show that the Asi ubiquitin ligase is involved in degradation of mislocalized integral membrane proteins, thus acting to maintain and safeguard the identity of the INM.","[Khmelinskii, Anton; Meurer, Matthias; Kirrmaier, Daniel; Knop, Michael] Univ Heidelberg ZMBH, Zentrum Mol Biol, DKFZ ZMBH Alliance, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Blaszczak, Ewa; Le Dez, Gaelle; Brossard, Audrey; Rabut, Gwenael] Ctr Natl Rech Sci, UMR 6290, F-35000 Rennes, France; [Blaszczak, Ewa; Le Dez, Gaelle; Brossard, Audrey; Rabut, Gwenael] Univ Rennes 1, Inst Genet & Dev Rennes, F-35000 Rennes, France; [Pantazopoulou, Marina; Omnus, Deike J.; Gunnarsson, Alexander; Ljungdahl, Per O.] Stockholm Univ, Wenner Gren Inst, Dept Mol Biosci, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Fischer, Bernd; Barry, Joseph D.; Huber, Wolfgang] European Mol Biol Lab EMBL, Genome Biol Unit, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Fischer, Bernd; Knop, Michael] German Canc Res Ctr, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Boone, Charles] Univ Toronto, Donnelly Ctr Cellular & Biomol Res, Dept Mol Genet, Toronto, ON M5S 3E1, Canada","Knop, M (reprint author), Univ Heidelberg ZMBH, Zentrum Mol Biol, DKFZ ZMBH Alliance, Neuenheimer Feld 282, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.",gwenael.rabut@inserm.fr; per.ljungdahl@su.se; m.knop@zmbh.uni-heidelberg.de,"Khmelinskii, Anton/B-2830-2008; Rabut, Gwenael/E-7257-2011; Ljungdahl, Per/M-5258-2013","Rabut, Gwenael/0000-0003-2658-2769; Ljungdahl, Per/0000-0002-6625-3540; Huber, Wolfgang/0000-0002-0474-2218; Khmelinskii, Anton/0000-0002-0256-5190; Barry, Joseph/0000-0002-1177-5771","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [Sonderforschungsbereich 1036 (SFB1036), TP10]; Swedish Research Council [VR2011-5925]; INSERM; ANR [ANR-12-JSV8-0003-001]; Biosit; European Molecular Biology Organization [EMBO ALTF 1124-2010, EMBO ASTF 546-2012]; Ministere de la Recherche et de l'Enseignement Superieur; La Ligue Contre le Cancer; CellNetworks Cluster of Excellence (DFG); EC Network of Excellence Systems Microscopy; Canadian Institute for Advanced Research [GNE-BOON-141871]; National Institutes of Health [R01HG005853-01]; Canadian Institute for Health Research [MOP-102629]; National Science and Engineering Research Council [RGPIN 204899-6]","We thank M.

ELEGANS; TRANSLATIONAL INHIBITION; LIFE-SPAN; GENES; CELLS; DEGRADATION; ACTIVATION; PATHWAYS,"Metazoans identify and eliminate bacterial pathogens in microbe-rich environments such as the intestinal lumen; however, the mechanisms are unclear. Host cells could potentially use intracellular surveillance or stress response programs to detect pathogens that target monitored cellular activities and then initiate innate immune responses(1-3). Mitochondrial function is evaluated by monitoring mitochondrial protein import efficiency of the transcription factor ATFS-1, which mediates the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt). During mitochondrial stress, mitochondrial import is impaired(4), allowing ATFS-1 to traffic to the nucleus where it mediates a transcriptional response to re-establish mitochondrial homeostasis(5). Here we examined the role of ATFS-1 in Caenorhabditis elegans during pathogen exposure, because during mitochondrial stress ATFS-1 induced not only mitochondrial protective genes but also innate immune genes that included a secreted lysozyme and anti-microbial peptides. Exposure to the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa caused mitochondrial dysfunction and activation of the UPRmt. C. elegans lacking atfs-1 were susceptible to P. aeruginosa, whereas hyper-activation of ATFS-1 and the UPRmt improved clearance of P. aeruginosa from the intestine and prolonged C. elegans survival in a manner mainly independent of known innate immune pathways(6,7). We propose that ATFS-1 import efficiency and the UPRmt is a means to detect pathogens that target mitochondria and initiate a protective innate immune response.","[Pellegrino, Mark W.; Nargund, Amrita M.; Gillis, Reba; Haynes, Cole M.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Cell Biol Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Kirienko, Natalia V.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Mol Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Kirienko, Natalia V.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Fiorese, Christopher J.; Haynes, Cole M.] Weill Cornell Med Coll, BCMB Allied Program, New York, NY 10065 USA","Haynes, CM (reprint author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Cell Biol Program, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10065 USA.",haynesc@mskcc.org,,"Fiorese, Christopher/0000-0002-7521-7103","Ellison Medical Foundation; Lucille Castori Center for Microbes, Inflammation and Cancer at MSKCC; National Institutes of Health [R01AG040061, F32AI100501, R01AI085581]","We thank E.

Recently, several laboratories have described a new class of rare influenza-neutralizing antibodies that target a conserved site in the haemagglutinin stem(1-6). Most of these antibodies use the heavy-chain variable region VH1-69 gene, and structural data demonstrate that they bind to the haemagglutinin stem through conserved heavy-chain complementarity determining region(HCDR) residues. However, the VH1-69 antibodies are highly mutated and are produced by some but not all individuals(6,7), suggesting that several somatic mutations may be required for their development(8,9). To address this, here we characterize 197 anti-stem antibodies from a single donor, reconstruct the developmental pathways of several VH1-69 clones and identify two key elements that are required for the initial development of most VH1-69 antibodies: a polymorphic germline-encoded phenylalanine at position 54 and a conserved tyrosine at position 98 in HCDR3. Strikingly, in most cases a single proline to alanine mutation at position 52a in HCDR2 is sufficient to confer high affinity binding to the selecting H1 antigen, consistent with rapid affinity maturation. Surprisingly, additional favourable mutations continue to accumulate, increasing the breadth of reactivity and making both the initial mutations and phenylalanine at position 54 functionally redundant. These results define VH1-69 allele polymorphism, rearrangement of the VDJ gene segments and single somatic mutations as the three requirements for generating broadly neutralizing VH1-69 antibodies and reveal an unexpected redundancy in the affinity maturation process.","[Pappas, Leontios; Foglierini, Mathilde; Piccoli, Luca; Silacci, Chiara; Fernandez-Rodriguez, Blanca; Giacchetto-Sasselli, Isabella; Sallusto, Federica; Corti, Davide; Lanzavecchia, Antonio] Univ Svizzera Italiana, Insitute Res Biomed, CH-6500 Bellinzona, Switzerland; [Kallewaard, Nicole L.; Zhu, Qing] Dis & Vaccines MedImmune LLC, Dept Infect, Gaithersburg, MD 20878 USA; [Vicenzi, Elisa] Ist Sci San Raffaele, Viral Pathogens & Biosafety Unit, I-20132 Milan, Italy; [Agatic, Gloria; Corti, Davide] Humabs BioMed SA, CH-6500 Bellinzona, Switzerland; [Pellicciotta, Gabriele] Ist Sci San Raffaele, Unit Prevent Med, I-20132 Milan, Italy; [Lanzavecchia, Antonio] ETH, Insitute Microbiol, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland","Lanzavecchia, A (reprint author), Univ Svizzera Italiana, Insitute Res Biomed, Via Vincenzo Vela 6, CH-6500 Bellinzona, Switzerland.",lanzavecchia@irb.usi.ch,,"Vicenzi, Elisa/0000-0003-0051-3968",European Research Council IMMUNExplore [250348]; Swiss National Science Foundation [141254]; Fondazione Cariplo Vaccine Program [2009-3594]; Human Frontiers Science Program [RGP0009/2007-C]; European Commission ADITEC [FP7-HEALTH-2011-280873]; National Institutes of Health [AI-057266]; Helmut Horten Foundation,"This work was partly supported by the European Research Council (grant number 250348) IMMUNExplore, the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant number 141254), Fondazione Cariplo Vaccine Program (grant number 2009-3594), the Human Frontiers Science Program (grant number RGP0009/2007-C), the European Commission (grant number FP7-HEALTH-2011-280873) ADITEC and the National Institutes of Health (U19 grant number AI-057266).

A recently discovered example is a fusion between the genes echinoderm microtubule-associated protein like 4 (EML4) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), generated by an inversion on the short arm of chromosome 2: inv(2) (p21p23). The EML4-ALK oncogene is detected in a subset of human non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC)(2) and is clinically relevant because it confers sensitivity to ALK inhibitors(3). Despite their importance, modelling such genetic events in mice has proven challenging and requires complex manipulation of the germ line. Here we describe an efficient method to induce specific chromosomal rearrangements in vivo using viral-mediated delivery of the CRISPR/Cas9 system to somatic cells of adult animals. We apply it to generate a mouse model of Eml4-Alk-driven lung cancer. The resulting tumours invariably harbour the Eml4-Alk inversion, express the Eml4-Alk fusion gene, display histopathological and molecular features typical of ALK(+) human NSCLCs, and respond to treatment with ALK inhibitors. The general strategy described here substantially expands our ability to model human cancers in mice and potentially in other organisms.","[Maddalo, Danilo; Manchado, Eusebio; Concepcion, Carla P.; Bonetti, Ciro; Vidigal, Joana A.; Han, Yoon-Chi; Ogrodowski, Paul; Lowe, Scott W.; Ventura, Andrea] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Canc Biol & Genet Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Concepcion, Carla P.] Cornell Univ, Weill Cornell Grad Sch Med Sci, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Crippa, Alessandra] Milano Bicocca Univ, Dept Med Oncol, San Gerardo Hosp, I-20052 Monza, Italy; [Rekhtman, Natasha] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, New York, NY 10065 USA; [de Stanchina, Elisa] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Mol Pharmacol Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Lowe, Scott W.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10065 USA","Ventura, A (reprint author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Canc Biol & Genet Program, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10065 USA.",venturaa@mskcc.org,,"Maddalo, Danilo/0000-0002-3228-1703","Geoffrey Beene Cancer Research Foundation; NCI (Cancer Center Support Grant) [P30 CA008748]; HHMI; NCI; American Italian Cancer Foundation; Foundation Blanceflor Boncompagni Ludovisi, nee Bildt; Jane Coffin Childs Foundation","We would like to thank M.

Here we describe a novel CRISPR/Cas9-based approach for rapid functional investigation of candidate genes in well-established autochthonous mouse models of cancer. Using a Kras(G12D)-driven lung cancer model(5), we performed functional characterization of a panel of tumour suppressor genes with knownloss-of-function alterations in human lung cancer. Cre-dependent somatic activation of oncogenic Kras(G12D) combined with CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing of tumour suppressor genes resulted in lung adenocarcinomas with distinct histopathological and molecular features. This rapid somatic genome engineering approach enables functional characterization of putative cancer genes in the lung and other tissues using autochthonous mouse models.

On chromosome arms, small regions of chromatin locally interact to form 'globules'. This feature requires a function of cohesin distinct from its role in sister chromatid cohesion. Cohesin is enriched at globule boundaries and its loss causes disruption of local globule structures and global chromosome territories. By contrast, heterochromatin, which loads cohesin at specific sites including pericentromeric and subtelomeric domains(9-11), is dispensable for globule formation but nevertheless affects genome organization. We show that heterochromatin mediates chromatin fibre compaction at centromeres and promotes prominent inter-arm interactions within centromere-proximal regions, providing structural constraints crucial for proper genome organization. Loss of heterochromatin relaxes constraints on chromosomes, causing an increase in intra-and inter-chromosomal interactions. Together, our analyses uncover fundamental genome folding principles that drive higher-order chromosome organization crucial for coordinating nuclear functions.","[Mizuguchi, Takeshi; Mehta, Sameet; Taneja, Nitika; Folco, Hernan Diego; Barrowman, Jemima; Grewal, Shiv I.

These structures have been considered rare transcriptional by-products with potentially harmful effects on genome integrity owing to the fragility of the displaced DNA coding strand(1). However, R-loops may also possess beneficial effects, as their widespread formation has been detected over CpG island promoters in human genes(2,3). Furthermore, we have previously shown that R-loops are particularly enriched over G-rich terminator elements. These facilitate RNA polymerase II (Pol II) pausing before efficient termination(4). Here we reveal an unanticipated link between R-loops and RNA-interference-dependent H3K9me2 formation over pause-site termination regions in mammalian protein-coding genes. We show that R-loops induce antisense transcription over these pause elements, which in turn leads to the generation of double-stranded RNA and the recruitment of DICER, AGO1, AGO2 and the G9a histone lysine methyltransferase. Consequently, an H3K9me2 repressive mark is formed and heterochromatin protein 1 gamma (HP1 gamma) is recruited, which reinforces Pol II pausing before efficient transcriptional termination. We predict that R-loops promote a chromatin architecture that defines the termination region for a substantial subset of mammalian genes.","[Skourti-Stathaki, Konstantina; Kamieniarz-Gdula, Kinga; Proudfoot, Nicholas J.] Univ Oxford, Sir William Dunn Sch Pathol, Oxford OX1 3RE, England","Proudfoot, NJ (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Sir William Dunn Sch Pathol, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3RE, England.",nicholas.proudfoot@path.ox.ac.uk,,"Proudfoot, Nicholas/0000-0001-8646-3222",Wellcome Trust [091805/Z/10/Z]; European Research Council [339270-polyloop]; Marie Curie Actions grant from EU FP7 (REA grant) [327985],"This work was supported by a Wellcome Trust Programme grant (091805/Z/10/Z) and a European Research Council Advanced grant (339270-polyloop) to N.J.P., and a Marie Curie Actions grant from EU FP7 (REA grant agreement, 327985) to K.K.-G.

Current estimates of global H-2 production from the marine lithosphere by water-rock reactions (hydration) are in the range of 10(11) moles per year(5-9). Recent explorations of saline fracture waters in the Precambrian continental subsurface have identified environments as rich in H-2 as hydrothermal vents and seafloor-spreading centres(1,2) and have suggested a link between dissolved H-2 and the radiolytic dissociation of water(10,11). However, extrapolation of a regional H-2 flux based on the deep gold mines of the Witwatersrand basin in South Africa(11) yields a contribution of the Precambrian lithosphere to global H-2 production that was thought to be negligible (0.009 x 10(11) moles per year)(6). Here we present a global compilation of published and new H-2 concentration data obtained from Precambrian rocks and find that the H-2 production potential of the Precambrian continental lithosphere has been underestimated. We suggest that this can be explained by a lack of consideration of additional H-2-producing reactions, such as serpentinization, and the absence of appropriate scaling of H-2 measurements from these environments to account for the fact that Precambrian crust represents over 70 per cent of global continental crust surface area(12). If H-2 production via both radiolysis and hydration reactions is taken into account, our estimate of H-2 production rates from the Precambrian continental lithosphere of 0.36-2.27 x 10(11) moles per year is comparable to estimates from marine systems.","[Lollar, Barbara Sherwood; Lacrampe-Couloume, G.] Univ Toronto, Dept Earth Sci, Toronto M5S 3B1, ON, Canada; [Onstott, T.

Pluripotent cells can be captured via the archetypal derivation of embryonic stem cells or via somatic cell reprogramming. Somatic cells are induced to acquire a pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) state through the forced expression of key transcription factors, and in the mouse these cells can fulfil the strictest of all developmental assays for pluripotent cells by generating completely iPSC-derived embryos and mice. However, it is not known whether there are additional classes of pluripotent cells, or what the spectrum of reprogrammed phenotypes encompasses. Here we explore alternative outcomes of somatic reprogramming by fully characterizing reprogrammed cells independent of preconceived definitions of iPSC states. We demonstrate that by maintaining elevated reprogramming factor expression levels, mouse embryonic fibroblasts go through unique epigenetic modifications to arrive at a stable, Nanog-positive, alternative pluripotent state. In doing so, we prove that the pluripotent spectrum can encompass multiple, unique cell states.","[Tonge, Peter D.; Corso, Andrew J.; Monetti, Claudio; Hussein, Samer M.

Some models predict rapid collapse(1,2), whereas others predict timescales of more than one million years (ref. 3). One possible approach to determining the age is through chemical changes as cloud contraction occurs, in particular through indirect measurements of the ratio of the two spin isomers (ortho/para) of molecular hydrogen, H-2, which decreases monotonically with age(4-6). This has beendone for the dense cloud core L183, for which the deuterium fractionation of diazenylium(N2H+) was used as a chemical clock to infer(7) that the core has contracted rapidly (on a timescale of less than 700,000 years). Among astronomically observable molecules, the spin isomers of the deuterated trihydrogen cation, ortho-H2D+ and para-H2D+, have the most direct chemical connections to H-2 (refs 8-12) and their abundance ratio provides a chemical clock that is sensitive to greater cloud core ages. So far this ratio has not been determined because para-H2D+ is very difficult to observe. The detection of its rotational ground-state line has only now become possible thanks to accurate measurements of its transition frequency in the laboratory(13), and recent progress in instrumentation technology(14,15). Here we report observations of ortho-and para-H2D+ emission and absorption, respectively, from the dense cloud core hosting IRAS 16293-2422 A/B, a group of nascent solar-type stars (with ages of less than 100,000 years). Using the ortho/para ratio in conjunction with chemical models, we find that the dense core has been chemically processed for at least one million years. The apparent discrepancy with the earlier N2H+ work(7) arises because that chemical clock turns off sooner than the H2D+ clock, but both results imply that star-forming dense cores have ages of about one million years, rather than 100,000 years.","[Bruenken, Sandra; Chambers, Edward T.; Asvany, Oskar; Honingh, Cornelia E.; Stutzki, Juergen; Schlemmer, Stephan] Univ Cologne, Inst Phys, D-50937 Cologne, Germany; [Sipilae, Olli; Harju, Jorma] Univ Helsinki, Dept Phys, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Sipilae, Olli; Caselli, Paola] Max Planck Inst Extraterr Phys, D-85741 Garching, Germany; [Caselli, Paola] Univ Leeds, Sch Phys & Astron, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Kaminski, Tomasz; Menten, Karl M.] Max Planck Inst Radioastron, D-53121 Bonn, Germany","Brunken, S (reprint author), Univ Cologne, Inst Phys, Zulpicher Str 77, D-50937 Cologne, Germany.",bruenken@phl.uni-koeln.de; schlemmer@ph1.uni-koeln.de,"Brunken, Sandra/B-1880-2010; Schlemmer, Stephan/E-2903-2015","Brunken, Sandra/0000-0001-7175-4828; Schlemmer, Stephan/0000-0002-1421-7281; Harju, Jorma/0000-0002-1189-9790; Caselli, Paola/0000-0003-1481-7911","NASA [NAS2-97001]; DLR [50 OK0901]; Collaborative Research Centre 956 - Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG); Academy of Finland [132291, 250741]; European Research Council (ERC) [PALs 320620]","GREAT is a development by the MPI fur Radioastronomie and the KOSMA/Universitat zu Koln, in cooperation with the MPI fur Sonnensystemforschung and the DLR Institut fur Planetenforschung.

Here we demonstrate that sensors based on nanoscale crack junctions and inspired by the geometry of a spider's slit organ can attain ultrahigh sensitivity and serve multiple purposes. The sensors are sensitive to strain (with a gauge factor of over 2,000 in the 0-2 per cent strain range) and vibration (with the ability to detect amplitudes of approximately 10 nanometres). The device is reversible, reproducible, durable and mechanically flexible, and can thus be easily mounted on human skin as an electronic multipixel array. The ultrahigh mechanosensitivity is attributed to the disconnection-reconnection process undergone by the zip-like nanoscale crack junctions under strain or vibration. The proposed theoretical model is consistent with experimental data that we report here. We also demonstrate that sensors based on nanoscale crack junctions are applicable to highly selective speech pattern recognition and the detection of physiological signals. The nanoscale crack junction-based sensory system could be useful in diverse applications requiring ultrahigh displacement sensitivity.","[Kang, Daeshik; Pikhitsa, Peter V.; Choi, Yong Whan; Lee, Chanseok; Shin, Sung Soo; Piao, Linfeng; Suh, Kahp-Yang; Choi, Mansoo] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Global Frontier Ctr Multiscale Energy Syst, Seoul 151742, South Korea; [Kang, Daeshik; Suh, Kahp-Yang; Choi, Mansoo] Seoul Natl Univ, Div WCU Multiscale Mech Design, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Seoul 151742, South Korea; [Park, Byeonghak; Kim, Tae-il] Inst Basic Sci IBS, Ctr Neurosci Imaging Res CNIR, Suwon 440746, South Korea; [Park, Byeonghak; Kim, Tae-il] Sungkyunkwan Univ SKKU, Sch Chem Engn, Suwon 440746, South Korea; [Suh, Kahp-Yang] Seoul Natl Univ, Interdisciplinary Program Bioengn, Seoul 151742, South Korea","Choi, M (reprint author), Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Global Frontier Ctr Multiscale Energy Syst, Seoul 151742, South Korea.",taeilkim@skku.edu; mchoi@snu.ac.kr,,"Kim, Tae-il/0000-0002-6667-5356","Global Frontier R&D Program of the Center for Multiscale Energy Systems - National Research Foundation of Korea under the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning [2011-0031561, 2011-0031577, IBS-R015-D1, NRF-2013-R1A1A1061403]; Basic Science Research Program - National Research Foundation of Korea under the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning [IBS-R015-D1, NRF-2013-R1A1A1061403, 2009-0083540]","This work is dedicated to the late Kahp-Yang Suh, one of the great pioneers of biomimetics.

This interest has arisen because it is a maximally thin membrane that, once perforated with atomic accuracy, may allow ultrafast and highly selective sieving of gases, liquids, dissolved ions and other species of interest(2,9-19). However, a perfect graphene monolayer is impermeable to all atoms and molecules under ambient conditions(1-7): even hydrogen, the smallest of atoms, is expected to take billions of years to penetrate graphene's dense electronic cloud(3-6). Only accelerated atoms possess the kinetic energy required to do this(20,21). The same behaviour might reasonably be expected in the case of other atomically thin crystals(22,23). Here we report transport and mass spectroscopy measurements which establish that monolayers of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are highly permeable to thermal protons under ambient conditions, whereas no proton transport is detected for thicker crystals such as monolayer molybdenum disulphide, bilayer graphene or multilayer hBN. Protons present an intermediate case between electrons (which can tunnel easily through atomically thin barriers(24)) and atoms, yet our measured transport rates are unexpectedly high(4,5) and raise fundamental questions about the details of the transport process. We see the highest room-temperature proton conductivity with monolayer hBN, for which we measure a resistivity to proton flow of about 10 Omega cm(2) and a low activation energy of about 0.3 electronvolts. At higher temperatures, hBN is outperformed by graphene, the resistivity of which is estimated to fall below 10(-3) Omega cm(2) above 250 degrees Celsius. Proton transport can be further enhanced by decorating the graphene and hBN membranes with catalytic metal nanoparticles. The high, selective proton conductivity and stability make one-atom-thick crystals promising candidates for use in many hydrogen-based technologies.","[Hu, S.; Lozada-Hidalgo, M.; Mishchenko, A.; Nair, R.

They are naturally present in large quantities on the deep ocean floor and as permafrost, can form in and block gas pipelines, and are thought to occur widely on Earth and beyond. A natural point of reference for this large and ubiquitous family of inclusion compounds is the empty hydrate lattice(1-6), which is usually regarded as experimentally inaccessible because the guest species stabilize the host framework. However, it has been suggested that sufficiently small guests may be removed to leave behind metastable empty clathrates(7,8), and guest-free Si-and Ge-clathrates have indeed been obtained(9,10). Here we show that this strategy can also be applied to water-based clathrates: five days of continuous vacuum pumping on small particles of neon hydrate (of structure sII) removes all guests, allowing us to determine the crystal structure, thermal expansivity and limit of metastability of the empty hydrate. It is the seventeenth experimentally established crystalline ice phase(11), ice XVI according to the current ice nomenclature, has a density of 0.81 grams per cubic centimetre (making it the least dense of all known crystalline water phases) and is expected(7,12) to be the stable low-temperature phase of water at negative pressures (that is, under tension). We find that the empty hydrate structure exhibits negative thermal expansion below about 55 kelvin, and that it is mechanically more stable and has at low temperatures larger lattice constants than the filled hydrate. These observations attest to the importance of kinetic effects and host-guest interactions in clathrate hydrates, with further characterization of the empty hydrate expected to improve our understanding of the structure, properties and behaviour of these unique materials.","[Falenty, Andrzej; Kuhs, Werner F.] Univ Gottingen, GZG Abt Kristallog, Goldschmidtstr 1, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Hansen, Thomas C.] Inst Max Von Laue Paul Langevin, F-38000 Grenoble, France","Kuhs, WF (reprint author), Univ Gottingen, GZG Abt Kristallog, Goldschmidtstr 1, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",wkuhs1@gwdg.de,"Hansen, Thomas/A-2729-2012; D20, Diffractometer/O-3123-2013","Hansen, Thomas/0000-0003-4611-2393; D20, Diffractometer/0000-0002-1572-1367; Falenty, Andrzej/0000-0001-5995-9900",Bundesministeriums fur Bildung und Forschung (BMBF),"We thank the Bundesministeriums fur Bildung und Forschung (BMBF) for financial support in the context of the first and second phase of the German SUGAR (SUbmarine Gashydrat-Lagerstatten: Erkundung, Abbau und TRansport) project.

The tropospheric N2O concentrations have varied substantially in the past in concert with changing climate on glacial-interglacial and millennial timescales(2-8). It is not well understood, however, how N2O emissions from marine and terrestrial sources change in response to varying environmental conditions. The distinct isotopic compositions of marine and terrestrial N2O sources can help disentangle the relative changes in marine and terrestrial N2O emissions during past climate variations(4,9,10). Here we present N2O concentration and isotopic data for the last deglaciation, from 16,000 to 10,000 years before present, retrieved from air bubbles trapped in polar ice at Taylor Glacier, Antarctica. With the help of our data and a box model of the N2O cycle, we find a 30 per cent increase in total N2O emissions from the late glacial to the interglacial, with terrestrial and marine emissions contributing equally to the overall increase and generally evolving in parallel over the last deglaciation, even though there is no a priori connection between the drivers of the two sources. However, we find that terrestrial emissions dominated on centennial timescales, consistent with a state-of-the-art dynamic global vegetation and land surface process model that suggests that during the last deglaciation emission changes were strongly influenced by temperature and precipitation patterns over land surfaces. The results improve our understanding of the drivers of natural N2O emissions and are consistent with the idea that natural N2O emissions will probably increase in response to anthropogenic warming(11).","[Schilt, Adrian; Brook, Edward J.; Bauska, Thomas K.] Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Schilt, Adrian; Fischer, Hubertus; Joos, Fortunat; Schmitt, Jochen; Spahni, Renato; Stocker, Thomas F.] Univ Bern, Inst Phys, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Schilt, Adrian; Fischer, Hubertus; Joos, Fortunat; Schmitt, Jochen; Spahni, Renato; Stocker, Thomas F.] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Baggenstos, Daniel; Severinghaus, Jeffrey P.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Petrenko, Vasilii V.] Univ Rochester, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Rochester, NY 14627 USA; [Schaefer, Hinrich] Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Wellington 6021, New Zealand","Schilt, A (reprint author), Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",adrian.schilt@gmail.com,"; Schmitt, Jochen/B-7893-2009; Fischer, Hubertus/A-1211-2014","Baggenstos, Daniel/0000-0001-9756-6884; Schmitt, Jochen/0000-0003-4695-3029; Fischer, Hubertus/0000-0002-2787-4221; Bauska, Thomas /0000-0003-1901-0367; Joos, Fortunat/0000-0002-9483-6030","Swiss National Science Foundation (NSF); US NSF; Swiss NSF [139404]; US NSF [PLR08-38936, PLR08-39031]; Marsden Fund Council from New Zealand Government; US Department of Energy; National Center for Atmospheric Research Supercomputing Facility","Financial support was provided by the Swiss National Science Foundation (NSF) and the US NSF, including a Swiss NSF Fellowship for Prospective Researchers (139404) to A.S., US NSF Grant PLR08-38936 to E.J.B. and US NSF Grant PLR08-39031 to J.P.S.

However, their complete life cycle is unknown and it is uncertain whether they had a cellularly differentiated ontogenetic stage, making it difficult to test their various phylogenetic interpretations. Here we describe new spheroidal fossils from black phosphorites of the Doushantuo Formation that have been overlooked in previous studies. These fossils represent later developmental stages of previously published blastula-like fossils, and they show evidence for cell differentiation, germ-soma separation, and programmed cell death. Their complex multicellularity is inconsistent with a phylogenetic affinity with bacteria, unicellular protists, or mesomycetozoean-like holozoans. Available evidence also indicates that the Doushantuo fossils are unlikely crown-group animals or volvocine green algae. We conclude that an affinity with cellularly differentiated multicellular eukaryotes, including stem-group animals or algae, is likely but more data are needed to constrain further the exact phylogenetic affinity of the Doushantuo fossils.","[Chen, Lei; Pang, Ke; Zhou, Chuanming; Yuan, Xunlai] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Chen, Lei; Pang, Ke; Zhou, Chuanming; Yuan, Xunlai] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, Key Lab Econ Stratig & Palaeogeog, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Chen, Lei; Pang, Ke] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Earth Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Shuhai] Virginia Tech, Dept Geosci, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Yuan, Xunlai] NW Univ Xian, Dept Geol, Xian 710069, Peoples R China","Xiao, S (reprint author), Virginia Tech, Dept Geosci, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",xiao@vt.edu; xlyuan@nigpas.ac.cn,"Zhou, Chuanming/E-5313-2010; Xiao, Shuhai/A-2190-2009","Xiao, Shuhai/0000-0003-4655-2663",Ministry of Science and Technology of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China; Chinese Academy of Sciences; US National Science Foundation,"This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China, National Natural Science Foundation of China, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the US National Science Foundation.

For each wave, the host eventually finds a way to repress retrotransposon transcription and prevent further insertions. In mouse embryonic stem cells, transcriptional silencing of retrotransposons requires KAP1 (also known as TRIM28) and its repressive complex, which can be recruited to target sites by KRAB zinc-finger(KZNF) proteins such as murine-specific ZFP809 which binds to integrated murine leukaemia virus DNA elements and recruits KAP1 to repress them(4,5). KZNF genes are one of the fastest growing gene families in primates and this expansion is hypothesized to enable primates to respond to newly emerged retrotransposons(6,7). However, the identity of KZNF genes battling retrotransposons currently active in the human genome, such as SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA)(8) and long interspersed nuclear element 1 (L1)(9), is unknown. Here we show that two primate-specific KZNF genes rapidly evolved to repress these two distinct retrotransposon families shortly after they began to spread in our ancestral genome. ZNF91 underwent a series of structural changes 8-12 million years ago that enabled it to repress SVA elements. ZNF93 evolved earlier to repress the primate L1 lineage until similar to 12.5 million years ago when the L1PA3-subfamily of retrotransposons escaped ZNF93's restriction through the removal of the ZNF93-binding site. Our data support a model where KZNF gene expansion limits the activity of newly emerged retrotransposon classes, and this is followed by mutations in these retrotransposons to evade repression, a cycle of events that could explain the rapid expansion of lineage-specific KZNF genes.","[Jacobs, Frank M.

Recent shifts in dietary consumption may have contributed importantly to this surge, but how dietary consumption modulates inflammatory disease is poorly defined. Pstpip2(cmo) mice, which express a homozygous Leu98Pro missense mutation in the Pombe Cdc15 homology family protein PSTPIP2 (proline-serine-threonine phosphatase interacting protein 2), spontaneously develop osteomyelitis that resembles chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis in humans(2-4). Recent reports demonstrated a crucial role for interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) in osteomyelitis, but deletion of the inflammasome components caspase-1 and NLRP3 failed to rescue Pstpip2(cmo) mice from inflammatory bone disease(5,6). Thus, the upstream mechanisms controlling IL-1 beta production in Pstpip2(cmo) mice remain to be identified. In addition, the environmental factors driving IL-1 beta-dependent inflammatory bone erosion are unknown. Here we show that the intestinal microbiota of diseased Pstpip2(cmo) mice was characterized by an outgrowth of Prevotella. Notably, Pstpip2(cmo) mice that were fed a diet rich in fat and cholesterol maintained a normal body weight, but were markedly protected against inflammatory bone disease and bone erosion. Diet-induced protection against osteomyelitis was accompanied by marked reductions in intestinal Prevotella levels and significantly reduced pro-IL-1 beta expression in distant neutrophils. Furthermore, pro-IL-1 beta expression was also decreased in Pstpip2(cmo) mice treated with antibiotics, and in wild-type mice that were kept under germ-free conditions. We further demonstrate that combined deletion of caspases 1 and 8 was required for protection against IL-1 beta-dependent inflammatory bone disease, whereas the deletion of either caspase alone or of elastase or neutrophil proteinase 3 failed to prevent inflammatory disease. Collectively, this work reveals diet-associated changes in the intestinal microbiome as a crucial factor regulating inflammasome- and caspase-8-mediated maturation of IL-1 beta and osteomyelitis in Pstpip2cmo mice.","[Lukens, John R.; Gurung, Prajwal; Johnson, Gordon R.; Bandi, Srinivasa Rao; Kanneganti, Thirumala-Devi] St Jude Childrens Res Hosp, Dept Immunol, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Vogel, Peter] St Jude Childrens Res Hosp, Anim Resources Ctr, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Vogel, Peter] St Jude Childrens Res Hosp, Vet Pathol Core, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Carter, Robert A.; McGoldrick, Daniel J.] St Jude Childrens Res Hosp, Hartwell Ctr Bioinformat & Biotechnol, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Calabrese, Christopher R.] St Jude Childrens Res Hosp, Small Anim Imaging Core, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Vande Walle, Lieselotte; Lamkanfi, Mohamed] Univ Ghent VIB, Dept Med Prot Res, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Vande Walle, Lieselotte; Lamkanfi, Mohamed] Univ Ghent, Dept Biochem, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium","Kanneganti, TD (reprint author), St Jude Childrens Res Hosp, Dept Immunol, 332 N Lauderdale St, Memphis, TN 38105 USA.",thirumala-devi.kanneganti@stjude.org,,"Bandi, Srinivasa/0000-0001-9320-5248; Kanneganti, Thirumala-Devi/0000-0002-6395-6443","Ghent University [BOF 01N02313, 01J11113]; European Research Council [281600]; National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health [AR056296]; National Cancer Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health [CA163507]; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health [AI101935]; ALSAC","We thank D.

They provide a fitness advantage in pathogenic strains and induce a strong pro-inflammatory response during bacteraemia(1,4,5). Curli formation requires a dedicated protein secretion machinery comprising the outer membrane lipoprotein CsgG and two soluble accessory proteins, CsgE and CsgF(6,7). Here we report the X-ray structure of Escherichia coli CsgGin a non-lipidated, soluble form as well as in its native membrane-extracted conformation. CsgG forms an oligomeric transport complex composed of nine anticodon-binding-domain-like units that give rise to a 36-stranded beta-barrel that traverses the bilayer and is connected to a cage-like vestibule in the periplasm. The transmembrane and periplasmic domains are separated by a 0.9-nm channel constriction composed of three stacked concentric phenylalanine, asparagine and tyrosine rings that may guide the extended polypeptide substrate through the secretion pore. The specificity factor CsgE forms a nonameric adaptor that binds and closes off the periplasmic face of the secretion channel, creating a 24,000 angstrom(3) pre-constriction chamber. Our structural, functional and electrophysiological analyses imply that CsgG is an ungated, non-selective protein secretion channel that is expected to employ a diffusion-based, entropy-driven transport mechanism.","[Goyal, Parveen; Van Genven, Nani; Van den Broeck, Imke; Jonckheere, Wim; Remaut, Han] VIB, Struct Biol Res Ctr, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Goyal, Parveen; Van Genven, Nani; Van den Broeck, Imke; Jonckheere, Wim; Remaut, Han] Vrije Univ Brussel, Struct Biol Brussels, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Krasteva, Petya V.; Gubellini, Francesca; Fronzes, Remi] Inst Pasteur, Unite Biol Struct Secret Bacterienne G5, F-75015 Paris, France; [Krasteva, Petya V.; Gubellini, Francesca; Pehau-Arnaudet, Gerard; Fronzes, Remi] Inst Pasteur, CNRS, UMR 3528, F-75015 Paris, France; [Troupiotis-Tsailaki, Anastassia] Univ Libre Bruxelles, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Pinkner, Jerome S.; Hultgren, Scott J.] Washington Univ, Dept Mol Microbiol & Microbial Pathogenesis, Sch Med, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Chapman, Matthew R.] Univ Michigan, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Howorka, Stefan] UCL, Inst Struct & Mol Biol, Dept Chem, London WC1H 0AJ, England","Remaut, H (reprint author), VIB, Struct Biol Res Ctr, Pl Laan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",remi.fronzes@pasteur.fr; han.remaut@vib-vub.be,"goyal, parveen/J-8435-2014; Krasteva, Petya /E-4132-2014","goyal, parveen/0000-0002-7808-8298; Krasteva, Petya /0000-0002-1858-8127; Chapman, Matthew/0000-0002-2645-1294; Fronzes, Remi/0000-0003-3031-9824","VIB [PRJ9]; Hercules Foundation [UABR/09/005]; National Institutes of Health [AI099099, AI048689, A1073847]; Institut Pasteur; Centre national de la recherche scientifique; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; National Physical Laboratory; University College London Chemistry; 'Bourse Roux' from Institut Pasteur; European Research Council (ERC)","This research was supported by VIB through project grant PRJ9 (P.G., N.V.G. and H.R.), by Hercules Foundation through equipment grant UABR/09/005, by National Institutes of Health RO1 grants AI099099 and AI048689 (J.P. and S.J.H.) and A1073847 (M.R.C.), and by Institut Pasteur and Centre national de la recherche scientifique (F.G., G.P.A. and R.F.).

Work in mice showed that sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-2 (S1PR2), a G alpha 12 and G alpha 13 coupled receptor, promotes growth regulation and local confinement of germinal centre B cells(3,4). Recent deep sequencing studies of GCB-DLBCL have revealed mutations in many genes in this cancer, including in GNA13 (encoding G alpha 13) and S1PR2 (refs 5-7). Here we show, using in vitro and in vivo assays, that GCB-DLBCL-associated mutations occurring in S1PR2 frequently disrupt the receptor's Akt and migration inhibitory functions. G alpha 13-deficient mouse germinal centre B cells and human GCB-DLBCL cells were unable to suppress pAkt and migration in response to S1P, and G alpha 13-deficient mice developed germinal centre B-cell-derived lymphoma. Germinal centre B cells, unlike most lymphocytes, are tightly confined in lymphoid organs and do not recirculate. Remarkably, deficiency in G alpha 13, but not S1PR2, led to germinal centre B-cell dissemination into lymph and blood. GCB-DLBCL cell lines frequently carried mutations in the G alpha 13 effector ARHGEF1, and Arhgef1 deficiency also led to germinal centre B-cell dissemination. The incomplete phenocopy of G alpha 13- and S1PR2 deficiency led us to discover that P2RY8, an orphan receptor that is mutated in GCB-DLBCL and another germinal centre B-cell-derived malignancy, Burkitt's lymphoma, also represses germinal centre B-cell growth and promotes confinement via G alpha 13. These findings identify a G alpha 13-dependent pathway that exerts dual actions in suppressing growth and blocking dissemination of germinal centre B cells that is frequently disrupted in germinal centre B-cell-derived lymphoma.","[Muppidi, Jagan R.; Green, Jesse A.; Braun, Sterling E.; An, Jinping; Xu, Ying; Cyster, Jason G.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Muppidi, Jagan R.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Med, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Muppidi, Jagan R.; Green, Jesse A.; Braun, Sterling E.; An, Jinping; Xu, Ying; Cyster, Jason G.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Schmitz, Roland; Xiao, Wenming; Staudt, Louis M.] NCI, Lymphoid Malignancies Branch, Ctr Canc Res, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Larsens, Adrien B.; Vaidehi, Nagarajan] City Hope Natl Med Ctr, Beckman Res Inst, Div Immunol, Duarte, CA 91010 USA; [Rosenwald, Andreas] Univ Wurzburg, Dept Pathol, D-97080 Wurzburg, Germany; [Ott, German] Robert Bosch Krankenhaus, Dept Clin Pathol, D-70376 Stuttgart, Germany; [Ott, German] Dr Margarete Fischer Bosch Inst Clin Pharmacol, D-70376 Stuttgart, Germany; [Gascoyne, Randy D.] British Columbia Canc Agcy, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada; [Rimsza, Lisa M.] Univ Arizona, Dept Pathol, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA; [Campo, Elias] Univ Barcelona, Hosp Clin, E-08036 Barcelona, Spain; [Jaffe, Elaine S.] NCI, Pathol Lab, Ctr Canc Res, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Delabie, Jan] Univ Hosp, Rikshosp, Pathol Clin, N-0372 Oslo, Norway; [Smeland, Erlend B.] Univ Oslo, Univ Hosp, Rikshosp, Inst Canc Res, N-0310 Oslo, Norway; [Smeland, Erlend B.] Univ Oslo, Norwegian Radium Hosp, Fac Div, Ctr Canc Biomed, N-0310 Oslo, Norway; [Braziel, Rita M.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Tubbs, Raymond R.; Cook, J.

In bacteria, this process is traditionally considered to begin with the polymerization of the highly conserved tubulin-like protein FtsZinto a ring that locates precisely at mid-cell(1). Over the past decades, several systems have been reported to regulate the spatiotemporal assembly and placement of the FtsZ ring(2-5). However, the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, in common with many other organisms, is devoid of these canonical systems and the mechanisms of positioning the division machinery remain unknown(4,6). Here we characterize a novel factor that locates at the division site before FtsZ and guides septum positioning in pneumococcus. Mid-cell-anchored protein Z (MapZ) forms ring structures at the cell equator and moves apart as the cell elongates, therefore behaving as a permanent beacon of division sites. MapZ then positions the FtsZ ring through direct protein-protein interactions. MapZ-mediated control differs from previously described systems mostly on the basis of negative regulation of FtsZ assembly. Furthermore, MapZ is an endogenous target of the Ser/Thr kinase StkP, which was recently shown to have a central role in cytokinesis and morphogenesis of S. pneumoniae(7-9). We show that both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of MapZ are required for proper Z-ring formation and dynamics. Altogether, this work uncovers a new mechanism for bacterial cell division that is regulated by phosphorylation and illustrates that nature has evolved a diversity of cell division mechanisms adapted to the different bacterial clades.","[Fleurie, Aurore; Manuse, Sylvie; Zhao, Chao; Lavergne, Jean-Pierre; Combet, Christophe; Grangeasse, Christophe] Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, UMR 5086, IBCP, F-69007 Lyon, France; [Lesterlin, Christian; Sherratt, David] Univ Oxford, Dept Biochem, Oxford OX1 3QU, England; [Cluze, Caroline] Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, UMR 5305, Lab Biol Tissulaire & Ingn Threrapeut,IBCP, F-69007 Lyon, France; [Franz-Wachtel, Mirita; Macek, Boris] Univ Tubingen, Proteome Ctr Tubingen, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Kuru, Erkin; Van Nieuwenhze, Michael S.; Bruns, Yves V.] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Kuru, Erkin; Van Nieuwenhze, Michael S.; Bruns, Yves V.] Indiana Univ, Dept Chem, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA","Grangeasse, C (reprint author), Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, UMR 5086, IBCP, F-69007 Lyon, France.",christian.lesterlin@bioch.ox.ac.uk; c.grangeasse@ibcp.fr,"Macek, Boris/N-1442-2015","Macek, Boris/0000-0002-1206-2458; Lesterlin, Christian/0000-0002-9108-0848; Grangeasse, Christophe/0000-0002-5484-4589","CNRS; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; FINOVI foundation; Agence National de la Recherche [ANR-12-BSV3-0008-01]; Region Rhone-Alpes [ARC1]; Wellcome Trust [WT083469MA, 091911]; National Institutes of Health [GM051986]","This work was supported by grants from the CNRS, the Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, the FINOVI foundation, the Agence National de la Recherche (ANR-12-BSV3-0008-01) and the Region Rhone-Alpes (ARC1 and financial support for A.F.

In its native context, Cas9 acts on DNA substrates exclusively because both binding and catalysis require recognition of a short DNA sequence, known as the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), next to and on the strand opposite the twenty-nucleotide target site in dsDNA(4-7). Cas9 has proven to be a versatile tool for genome engineering and gene regulation in a large range of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell types, and in whole organisms(8), but it has been thought to be incapable of targeting RNA(5). Here we show that Cas9 binds with high affinity to single-stranded RNA(ssRNA) targets matching the Cas9-associated guide RNA sequence when the PAM is presented in trans as a separate DNA oligonucleotide. Furthermore, PAM-presenting oligonucleotides (PAMmers) stimulate site-specific endonucleolytic cleavage of ssRNA targets, similar to PAM-mediated stimulation of Cas9-catalysed DNA cleavage(7). Using specially designed PAMmers, Cas9 can be specifically directed to bind or cut RNA targets while avoiding corresponding DNA sequences, and we demonstrate that this strategy enables the isolation of a specific endogenous messenger RNA from cells. These results reveal a fundamental connection between PAM binding and substrate selection by Cas9, and highlight the utility of Cas9 for programmable transcript recognition without the need for tags.","[O'Connell, Mitchell R.; Oakes, Benjamin L.; East-Seletsky, Alexandra; Doudna, Jennifer A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Cell & Mol Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Sternberg, Samuel H.; Doudna, Jennifer A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kaplan, Matias; Doudna, Jennifer A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Doudna, Jennifer A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Phys Biosci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Doudna, JA (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Cell & Mol Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",doudna@berkeley.edu,,"Seletsky, Alexandra/0000-0001-6673-5817; O'Connell, Mitchell/0000-0002-8642-3973",National Science Foundation; National Defense Science & Engineering Graduate Research Fellowship programs; NIH NRSA; NIH [P50GM102706-03],"We thank B.

The identification of new histone modifications critical for transcriptional regulation at initiation, elongation or termination is of particular interest. Here we report a new layer of regulation in transcriptional elongation that is conserved from yeast to mammals. This regulation is based on the phosphorylation of a highly conserved tyrosine residue, Tyr 57, in histone H2A and is mediated by the unsuspected tyrosine kinase activity of casein kinase 2 (CK2). Mutation of Tyr 57 in H2A in yeast or inhibition of CK2 activity impairs transcriptional elongation in yeast as well as in mammalian cells. Genome-wide binding analysis reveals that CK2 alpha, the catalytic subunit of CK2, binds across RNA-polymerase-II-transcribed coding genes and active enhancers. Mutation of Tyr 57 causes a loss of H2B mono-ubiquitination as well as H3K4me3 and H3K79me3, histone marks associated with active transcription. Mechanistically, both CK2 inhibition and the H2A(Y57F) mutation enhance H2B deubiquitination activity of the Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase (SAGA) complex, suggesting a critical role of this phosphorylation in coordinating the activity of the SAGA complex during transcription. Together, these results identify a new component of regulation in transcriptional elongation based on CK2-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the globular domain of H2A.","[Basnet, Harihar; Tan, Yuliang; Merkurjev, Dana; Ohgi, Kenneth A.; Rosenfeld, Michael G.] Univ Calif San Diego, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Basnet, Harihar] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Biomed Sci Grad Program, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Su, Xue B.; Pillus, Lorraine] Univ Calif San Diego, UCSD Moores Canc Ctr, Mol Biol Sect, Div Biol Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Merkurjev, Dana] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Bioengn, Bioinformat & Syst Biol Program, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Meisenhelders, Jill; Hunters, Tony] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Mol & Cell Biol Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Rosenfeld, MG (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",lpillus@ucsd.edu; mrosenfeld@ucsd.edu,,,"NIH [NS034934, DK039949, DK018477, HL065445, CA173903, GM033279]; UC-CRCC; NCI [CA82683]","We acknowledge M.

Starting with early work on histone acetylation 1, a variety of residue-specific modifications have now been linked to RNA polymerase II (RNAP2) activity(2,3), but it remains unclear if these markers are active regulators of transcription or just passive byproducts(4,5). This is because studies have traditionally relied on fixed cell populations, meaning temporal resolution is limited to minutes at best, and correlated factors may not actually be present in the same cell at the same time. Complementary approaches are therefore needed to probe the dynamic interplay of histone modifications and RNAP2 with higher temporal resolution in single living cells(2,5,6). Here we address this problem by developing a system to track residue-specific histone modifications and RNAP2 phosphorylation in living cells by fluorescence microscopy. This increases temporal resolution to the tens-of-seconds range. Our single-cell analysis reveals histone H3 lysine-27 acetylation at a gene locus can alter downstream transcription kinetics by as much as 50%, affecting two temporally separate events. First acetylation enhances the search kinetics of transcriptional activators, and later the acetylation accelerates the transition of RNAP2 from initiation to elongation. Signatures of the latter can be found genome-wide using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing. We argue that this regulation leads to a robust and potentially tunable transcriptional response.","[Stasevich, Timothy J.; Hayashi-Takanaka, Yoko; Sato, Yuko; Kimura, Hiroshi] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Frontier Biosci, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Stasevich, Timothy J.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Stasevich, Timothy J.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Transcript Imaging Consortium, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA; [Hayashi-Takanaka, Yoko; Ohkawa, Yasuyuki; Kimura, Hiroshi] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy JST, Core Res Evolut Sci & Technol CREST, Saitama 3320012, Japan; [Hayashi-Takanaka, Yoko; Sato, Yuko; Kimura, Hiroshi] Tokyo Inst Technol, Grad Sch Biosci & Biotechnol, Dept Biol Sci, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2268501, Japan; [Maehara, Kazumitsu; Ohkawa, Yasuyuki] Kyushu Univ, Dept Adv Med Initiat, Fac Med, Fukuoka 8128582, Japan; [Sakata-Sogawa, Kumiko; Tokunaga, Makio] Tokyo Inst Technol, Grad Sch Biosci & Biotechnol, Dept Biol Informat, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2268501, Japan; [Sakata-Sogawa, Kumiko; Tokunaga, Makio] RIKEN Ctr Integrat Med Sci IMS, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Nagase, Takahiro] Kazusa DNA Res Inst, Dept Biotechnol Res, Chiba 2920818, Japan; [Nozaki, Naohito] Mab Inst Inc, Sapporo, Hokkaido 00002, Japan; [McNally, James G.] NCI, Lab Receptor Biol & Gene Express, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [McNally, James G.] Helmholtz Zentrum Berlin, Inst Soft Matter & Funct Mat, D-14109 Berlin, Germany","Stasevich, TJ (reprint author), Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Frontier Biosci, Osaka 5650871, Japan.",tim.stasevich@colostate.edu; hkimura@bio.titech.ac.jp,"U-ID, Kyushu/C-5291-2016; Ohkawa, Yasuyuki/C-4087-2016","Ohkawa, Yasuyuki/0000-0001-6440-9954; Kimura, Hiroshi/0000-0003-0854-083X","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan; JSPS","This work was supported by grants-in-aid from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) and the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan.

To address this gap in knowledge, we generated extensive transcriptomic, epigenomic and proteomic data sets describing the reprogramming routes leading from mouse embryonic fibroblasts to induced pluripotency. Through integrative analysis, we reveal that cells transition through distinct gene expression and epigenetic signatures and bifurcate towards reprogramming transgene-dependent and - independent stable pluripotent states. Early transcriptional events, driven by high levels of reprogramming transcription factor expression, are associated with widespread loss of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) trimethylation, representing a general opening of the chromatin state. Maintenance of high transgene levels leads to re-acquisition of H3K27me3 and a stable pluripotent state that is alternative to the embryonic stem cell (ESC)-like fate. Lowering transgene levels at an intermediate phase, however, guides the process to the acquisition of ESC-like chromatin and DNA methylation signature. Our data provide a comprehensive molecular description of the reprogramming routes and is accessible through the Project Grandiose portal at http://www.stemformatics.org.","[Hussein, Samer M.

Here we show that in mice beta-catenin mediates pro-resilient and anxiolytic effects in the nucleus accumbens, a key brain reward region, an effect mediated by D2-type medium spiny neurons. Using genome-wide beta-catenin enrichment mapping, we identify Dicer1-important in small RNA (for example, microRNA) biogenesis-as a beta-catenin target gene that mediates resilience. Small RNA profiling after excising beta-catenin fromnucleus accumbens in the context of chronic stress reveals beta-catenin-dependent microRNA regulation associated with resilience. Together, these findings establish beta-catenin as a critical regulator in the development of behavioural resilience, activating a network that includes Dicer1 and downstream microRNAs.

Here we set out to characterize transcriptional heterogeneity in mouse PSCs by single-cell expression profiling under different chemical and genetic perturbations. Signalling factors and developmental regulators show highly variable expression, with expression states for some variable genes heritable through multiple cell divisions. Expression variability and population heterogeneity can be influenced by perturbation of signalling pathways and chromatin regulators. Notably, either removal of mature microRNAs or pharmacological blockage of signalling pathways drives PSCs into a low-noise ground state characterized by a reconfigured pluripotency network, enhanced self-renewal and a distinct chromatin state, an effect mediated by opposing microRNA families acting on the Myc/Lin28/let-7 axis.

Here we present the crystal structure of the Na+-NQR complex at 3.5 angstrom resolution. The arrangement of cofactors both at the cytoplasmic and the periplastnic side of the complex, together with a hitherto unknown iron centre in the midst of the membrane-embedded part, reveals an electron transfer pathway from the NADH- oxidizing cytoplasmic NqrF subunit across the membrane to the petiplasmic NqrC, and back to the qui none reduction site on NqrA located in the cytoplasm. A soditun channel was localized in subunit Nqr13, which represents the largest membrane subunit of the Na+-NQR and is structurally related to urea and ammonia transporters. On the basis of the structure we propose a mechanism of redox-driven Na+ translocation where the change in redox state of the flavin mononucleotide cofactor in NqrB triggers the transport of Na+ through the observed channel.","[Steuber, Julia; Vorburger, Thomas] Univ Hohenheim, Dept Microbiol, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany; [Vohl, Georg; Casutt, Marco S.; Fritz, Guenter] Univ Freiburg, Inst Neuropathol, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [Vohl, Georg] Univ Freiburg, Hermann Staudinger Grad Sch, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Diederichs, Kay] Univ Konstanz, Dept Biol, D-78457 Constance, Germany","Fritz, G (reprint author), Univ Freiburg, Inst Neuropathol, Breisacher Str 64, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany.",guenter.fritz@uniklinik-freiburg.de,"Fritz, Guenter/E-2933-2013","Fritz, Guenter/0000-0002-4571-8812","'Methoden in den Lebenswissenschaften' of the Baden-Wurttemberg Stiftung P-LS-Meth/4; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [FR 1321/3-1, FR 1488/3-2]","We thank the staff at beamlines X06SA and X06DA at Swiss Light Source for excellent support.

Molecular gas is the phase of the interstellar medium from which stars form, so these outflows curtail stellar mass growth in galaxies. Previously known outflows, however, involve small fractions of the total molecular gas content and have typical scales of less than a kilopar-sec(1,2). In at least some cases, input from active galactic nuclei is dynamically important(2,3), so pure stellar feedback (the momentum return into the interstellar medium) has been considered incapable of rapidly terminating star formation on galactic scales. Molecular gas has been detected outside the galactic plane of the archetypal starburst galaxy M82 (refs 4 and 5), but so far there has been no evidence that starbursts can propel substantial quantities of cold molecular gas to the same galactocentric radius (about 10 kiloparsecs) as the warmer gas that has been traced by metal ion absorbers in the circumgalactic medium(6,7). Here we report observations of molecular gas in a compact (effective radius 100 parsecs) massive starburst galaxy at redshift 0.7, which is known to drive a fast outflow of ionized gas(8). We find that 35 per cent of the total molecular gas extends approximately 10 kiloparsecs, and one-third of this extended gas has a velocity of up to 1,000 kilometres per second. The kinetic energy associated with this high-velocity component is consistent with the momentum flux available from stellar radiation pressure(9-12). This demonstrates that nuclear bursts of star formation are capable of ejecting large amounts of cold gas from the central regions of galaxies, thereby strongly affecting their evolution by truncating star formation and redistributing matter(13,14).","[Geach, J.

In complex oxides, this method has been used to melt electronic order(4-6), drive insulator-to-metal transitions(7) and induce superconductivity(8). Strikingly, coherent interlayer transport strongly reminiscent of superconductivity can be transiently induced up to room temperature (300 kelvin) in IrBa2Cu3O6+x (refs 9, 10). Here we report the crystal structure of this exotic non-equilibrium state, determined by femtosecond X-ray diffraction and ab initio density functional theory calculations. We find that nonlinear lattice excitation in normal-state IrBa2Cu3O6-x at above the transition temperature of 52 kelvin causes a simultaneous increase and decrease in the Cu-O-2 intra-bilayer and, respectively, inter-bilayer distances, accompanied by anisotropic changes in the in-plane O-Cu-O bond buckling. Density functional theory calculations indicate that these motions cause drastic changes in the electronic structure. Among these, the enhancement in the d(x2-y2) character of the in-plane electronic structure is likely to favour superconductivity.","[Mankowsky, R.; Foerst, M.; Cavalleri, A.] Max Planck Inst Struct & Dynam Matter, D-22761 Hamburg, Germany; [Mankowsky, R.; Cavalleri, A.] Univ Hamburg, D-22761 Hamburg, Germany; [Mankowsky, R.; Foerst, M.; Cavalleri, A.] Ctr Free Elect Laser Sci CFEL, D-22761 Hamburg, Germany; [Subedi, A.; Georges, A.] Ecole Polytech, CNRS, Ctr Phys Theor, F-91128 Palaiseau, France; [Mariager, S.

However, not until the late twentieth century were breakthroughs achieved in demonstrating ultrahigh-speed imaging (more than 10(5) frames per second)(7). In particular, the introduction of electronic imaging sensors based on the charge-coupled device (CCD) or complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology revolutionized high-speed photography, enabling acquisition rates of up to 10(7) frames per second(8). Despite these sensors' widespread impact, further increasing frame rates using CCD or CMOS technology is fundamentally limited by their on-chip storage and electronic readout speed(9). Here we demonstrate a two-dimensional dynamic imaging technique, compressed ultrafast photography (CUP), which can capture non-repetitive time-evolving events at up to 10(11) frames per second. Compared with existing ultrafast imaging techniques, CUP has the prominent advantage of measuring an x-y- t (x, y, spatial coordinates; t, time) scene with a single camera snapshot, thereby allowing observation of transient events with temporal resolution as tens of picoseconds. Furthermore, akin to traditional photography, CUP is receive-only, and so does not need the specialized active illumination required by other single-shot ultrafast imagers(2,3). As a result, CUP can image a variety of luminescent such as fluorescent or bioluminescent objects. Using CUP, we visualize four fundamental physical phenomena with single laser shots only: laser pulse reflection and refraction, photon racing in two media, and fasterthan-light propagation of non-information (that is, motion that appears faster than the speed of light but cannot convey information). Given CUP's capability, we expect it to find widespread applications in both fundamental and applied sciences, including biomedical research.","[Gao, Liang; Liang, Jinyang; Li, Chiye; Wang, Lihong V.] Washington Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Opt Imaging Lab, St Louis, MO 63130 USA","Wang, LHV (reprint author), Washington Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Opt Imaging Lab, Campus Box 1097,One Brookings Dr, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",lhwang@wustl.edu,"Liang, Jinyang/C-7673-2015; Wang, Lihong/A-7147-2009","Wang, Lihong/0000-0001-9783-4383; Liang, Jinyang/0000-0001-5983-0488; Li, Chiye/0000-0003-3669-4297","National Institutes of Health [DP1 EB016986, R01 CA186567]",We thank N.

Charging times of seconds to minutes, with power densities exceeding those of batteries, can in principle be provided by electrochemical capacitors in particular, pseudocapacitors(1,2). Recent research has focused mainly on improving the gravimetric performance of the electrodes of such systems, but for portable electronics and vehicles volume is at a premium(3). The best volumetric capacitances of carbon-based electrodes are around 300 farads per cubic centimetre(4,5); hydrated ruthenium oxide can reach capacitances of 1,000 to 1,500 farads per cubic centimetre with great cydability, but only in thin films(6) Recently, electrodes made of two-dimensional titanium carbide (Ti3C2, a member of the 'MXene' family), produced by etching aluminium from titanium aluminium carbide (Ti3AlC2, a 'MAX' phase) in concentrated hydrofluoric acid, have been shown to have volumetric capacitances of over 300 farads per cubic centimetre(7,8). Here we report a method of producing this material using a solution of lithium fluoride and hydrochloric acid. The resulting hydrophilic material swells in volume when hydrated, and can be shaped like clay and dried into a highly conductive solid or rolled into films tens of micrometres thick. Additive-free films of this titanium carbide 'clay' have volumetric capacitances of up to 900 farads per cubic centimetre, with excellent cyclability and rate performances. This capacitance is almost twice that of our previous report(8), and our synthetic method also offers a much faster route to film production as well as the avoidance of handling hazardous concentrated hydrofluoric acid.","[Ghidiu, Michael; Lukatskaya, Maria R.; Zhao, Meng-Qiang; Gogotsi, Yury; Barsoum, Michel W.] Drexel Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Ghidiu, Michael; Lukatskaya, Maria R.; Zhao, Meng-Qiang; Gogotsi, Yury; Barsoum, Michel W.] Drexel Univ, AJ Drexel Nanomat Inst, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Gogotsi, Y (reprint author), Drexel Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",gogotsi@drexel.edu; barsoumw@drexel.edu,"Lukatskaya, Maria/A-8118-2012","Lukatskaya, Maria R./0000-0002-2794-4322","US National Science Foundation [DMR-1310245]; Fluid Interface Reactions, Structures and Transport (FIRST) Center, an Energy Frontier Research Center - US Department of Energy, Office of Science, and Office of Basic Energy Sciences","We thank O.

In particular, ENSO influences the yearly variations of tropical cyclone (TC) activities in both the Pacific and Atlantic basins through atmospheric dynamical factors such as vertical wind shear and stability(3-6). Until recently, however, the direct ocean thermal control of ENSO on TCs has not been taken into consideration because of an apparent mismatch in both timing and location: ENSO peaks in winter and its surface warming occurs mostly along the Equator, a region without TC activity. Here we show that El Nino the warm phase of an ENSO cycle effectively discharges heat into the eastern North Pacific basin two to three seasons after its wintertime peak, leading to intensified TCs. This basin is characterized by abundant TC activity and is the second most active TC region in the world(5-7). As a result of the time involved in ocean transport, El Ninio's equatorial subsurface 'heat reservoir', built up in boreal winter, appears in the eastern North Pacific several months later during peak TC season (boreal summer and autumn). By means of this delayed ocean transport mechanism, ENSO provides an additional heat supply favourable for the formation of strong hurricanes. This thermal control on intense TC variability has significant implications for seasonal predictions and long-term projections of TC activity over the eastern North Pacific.","[Jin, F. -F.; Boucharel, J.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, SOEST, Dept Atmospher Sci, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Lin, I. -I.] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Taipei 10617, Taiwan; [Jin, F. -F.] Chinese Meteorol Agcy, Beijing Climate Ctr, Lab Climate Studies, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China","Jin, FF (reprint author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, SOEST, Dept Atmospher Sci, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",jff@hawaii.edu; bouch@hawaii.edu,"Lin, I-I/J-4695-2013","Lin, I-I/0000-0002-8364-8106; Boucharel, Julien/0000-0003-4598-3349","US National Science Foundation [ATM 1034798, ATM 1406601]; US Department of Energy [DESC005110]; US NOM [NA100AR4310200]; China Meteorological Special Project [GYHY201206033]; 973 Program of China [2010CB950404, 2013CB430203]; Taiwan's Ministry of Science and Technology [NSC 101-2111-M-002-002-MY2, NSC 101-2628-M-002-001-MY4, 102R7803]","We thank P.

Here we show that employees of a large, international bank behave, on average, honestly in a control condition. However, when their professional identity as bank employees is rendered salient, a significant proportion of them become dishonest. This effect is specific to bank employees because control experiments with employees from other industries and with students show that they do not become more dishonest when their professional identity or bank-related items are rendered salient. Our results thus suggest that the prevailing business culture in the banking industry weakens and undermines the honesty norm, implying that measures to re-establish an honest culture are very important.","[Cohn, Alain; Fehr, Ernst; Marechal, Michel Andre] Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland","Fehr, E (reprint author), Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.",ernst.fehr@econ.uzh.ch; michel.marechal@econ.uzh.ch,,,"European Research Council Grant ""Foundations of Economic Preferences""; Gottlieb Duttweiler Institute","We thank the participating bank, the alumni network organizations of three education programmes, and the municipal office for enabling the research; G.

Cell expansion requires ordered arrangement of the cytoskeleton(2) but molecular mechanisms underlying its regulation by signalling molecules including auxin are unknown. Here we show in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana that in elongating cells exogenous application of auxin or redistribution of endogenous auxin induces very rapid microtubule re-orientation from transverse to longitudinal, coherent with the inhibition of cell expansion. This fast auxin effect requires auxin binding protein 1 (ABP1) and involves a contribution of downstream signalling components such as ROP6 GTPase, ROP-interactive protein RIC1 and the microtubule-severing protein katanin. These components are required for rapid auxin- and ABP I -mediated re-orientation of microtubules to regulate cell elongation in roots and dark-grown hypocotyls as well as asymmetric growth during gravitropic responses.","[Chen, Xu; Li, Hongjiang; Hauschild, Robert; Ralcusova, Hana; Benkova, Eva; Friml, Jiri] Inst Sci Technol Austria 1ST Austria, A-3400 Klosterneuburg, Austria; [Chen, Xu; Li, Hongjiang; Abuzeineh, Anas; Ralcusova, Hana; Benkova, Eva; Friml, Jiri] Univ Ghent, Vlaams Inst Biotechnol VIB, Dept Plant Syst Biol, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium; [Chen, Xu; Li, Hongjiang; Abuzeineh, Anas; Ralcusova, Hana; Benkova, Eva; Friml, Jiri] Univ Ghent, Dept Plant Biotechnol & Genet, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium; [Grandont, Laurie; Paque, Sebastien; Perrot-Rechenmann, Catherine] CNRS, Saclay Plant Sci LabEx, Inst Sci Vegetal, UPR2355, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France","Perrot-Rechenmann, C (reprint author), CNRS, Saclay Plant Sci LabEx, Inst Sci Vegetal, UPR2355, 1 Ave Terrasse, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France.",Catherine.Rechenmann@isv.cnrs-gif.fr; jiri.friml@ist.ac.at,,,European Research Council [ERC-2011-StG-20101109-PSDP]; ANR blanc AuxiWall project [ANR-11-BSV5-0007]; Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology (IWT); Conseil General de l'Essonne,"We thank R.

Whereas the symbiotic contribution of commensal bacteria is well established, the role of eukaryotic viruses that are present in the gastrointestinal tract under homeostatic conditions is undefined(2,3). Here we demonstrate that a common enteric RNA virus can replace the beneficial function of commensal bacteria in the intestine. Mmine norovirus (MNV) infection of germ-free or antibiotictreated mice restored intestinal morphology and lymphocyte function without inducing overt inflammation and disease. The presence of MNV also suppressed an expansion of group 2 innate lymphoid cells observed in the absence of bacteria, and induced transcriptional changes in the intestine associated with immune development and type I interferon (IFN) signalling. Consistent with this observation, the IFN-a receptor was essential for the ability of MNV to compensate for bacterial depletion. Importantly, MNV infection offset the deleterious effect of treatment with antibiotics in models of intestinal injury and pathogenic bacterial infection. These data indicate that eukaryotic viruses have the capacity to support intestinal homeostasis and shape mucosal immunity, similarly to commensal bacteria.","[Kernbauer, Elisabeth; Cadwell, Ken] NYU, Sch Med, Skirball Inst, Kimmel Ctr Biol & Med, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Kernbauer, Elisabeth; Cadwell, Ken] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Ding, Yi] New York Presbyterian Hosp, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Ding, Yi] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10016 USA","Cadwell, K (reprint author), NYU, Sch Med, Skirball Inst, Kimmel Ctr Biol & Med, New York, NY 10016 USA.",ken.cadwell@med.nyu.edu,,"Cadwell, Ken/0000-0002-5860-0661",Cancer Center Support Grant [P30CA016087]; National Institutes of Health [R01 DK093668]; New York University Whitehead Fellowship; Vilcek Fellowship; Erwin Schrodinger Fellowship from the Austrian Science Foundation,"We would like to thank S.

Mature Hh carries hydrophobic palmitic acid and cholesterol modifications essential for its extracellular spreading(2). Various extracellular transportation mechanisms for Hh have been suggested, but the pathways actually used for Hh secretion and transport in vivo remain unclear. Here we show that Hh secretion in Drosophila wing imaginal discs is dependent on the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)(3). In vivo the reduction of ESCRT activity in cells producing Hh leads to a retention of Hh at the external cell surface. Furthermore, we show that ESCRT activity in Hh-producing cells is required for long-range signalling. We also provide evidence that pools of Hh and ESCRT proteins are secreted together into the extracellular space in vivo and can subsequently be detected together at the surface of receiving cells. These findings uncover a new function for ESCRT proteins in controlling morphogen activity and reveal a new mechanism for the transport of secreted Hh across the tissue by extracellular vesicles, which is necessary for long-range target induction.","[Matusek, Tamas; Wendler, Franz; Poles, Sophie; Pizette, Sandrine; D'Angelo, Gisela; Fuerthauer, Maximilian; Therond, Pascal P.] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, IBV, UMR 7277, F-06100 Nice, France; [Matusek, Tamas; Wendler, Franz; Poles, Sophie; Pizette, Sandrine; D'Angelo, Gisela; Fuerthauer, Maximilian; Therond, Pascal P.] CNRS, IBV, UMR 7277, F-06100 Nice, France; [Matusek, Tamas; Wendler, Franz; Poles, Sophie; Pizette, Sandrine; D'Angelo, Gisela; Fuerthauer, Maximilian; Therond, Pascal P.] INSERM, IBV, U1091, F-06100 Nice, France","Therond, PP (reprint author), Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, IBV, UMR 7277, F-06100 Nice, France.",therond@unice.fr,,,"French Government (National Research Agency, ANR) through the ""Investments for the Future"" LABEX SIGNALIFE [ANR-11-LABX-0028-01]; Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale [DEQ20110421324]; Fondation Association pour la Recherche Contre le Cancer (ARC); Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer; ATIP/Avenir; ARC; Human Frontier Science Program","This work was supported by the French Government (National Research Agency, ANR) through the ""Investments for the Future"" LABEX SIGNALIFE (program reference number ANR-11-LABX-0028-01) and by the Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale (reference number DEQ20110421324).

Both centrioles are regarded as equivalent in their ability to form new centrioles and their symmetric duplication is crucial for cell division homeostasis(2,4). Multiciliated cells do not use the archetypal duplication program and instead form more than a hundred centrioles that are required for the growth of motile cilia and the efficient propelling of physiological fluids(5). The majority of these new centrioles are thought to appear de novo, that is, independently from the centrosome, around electron-dense structures called deuterosomes(5,9). Their origin remains unknown. Using live imaging combined with correlative super-resolution light and electron microscopy, we show that all new centrioles derive from the pre-existing progenitor cell centrosome through multiple rounds of procentriole seeding. Moreover, we establish that only the daughter centrosomal centriole contributes to deuterosome formation, and thus to over ninety per cent of the final centriole population. This unexpected centriolar asymmetry grants new perspectives when studying cilia-related diseases and pathological centriole amplification observed in cycling cells and associated with microcephaly and cancer(2-4,10).","[Al Jord, Adel; Lemaitre, Anne-Iris; Delgehyr, Nathalie; Faucourt, Marion; Spassky, Nathalie; Meunier, Alice] Ecole Normale Super, ENS, IBENS, Inst Biol, F-75005 Paris, France; [Al Jord, Adel; Lemaitre, Anne-Iris; Delgehyr, Nathalie; Faucourt, Marion; Spassky, Nathalie; Meunier, Alice] INSERM, U1024, F-75005 Paris, France; [Al Jord, Adel; Lemaitre, Anne-Iris; Delgehyr, Nathalie; Faucourt, Marion; Spassky, Nathalie; Meunier, Alice] CNRS, UMR 8197, F-75005 Paris, France","Spassky, N (reprint author), Ecole Normale Super, ENS, IBENS, Inst Biol, F-75005 Paris, France.",nathalie.spassky@ens.fr; alice.meunier@ens.fr,"Spassky, Nathalie/E-3932-2016","spassky, nathalie/0000-0003-4722-6464; Meunier, Alice/0000-0001-6131-7747","Federation pour la Recherche sur le Cerveau; Region Ile de France DIM NeRF; France-BioImaging; CNRS; ENS; INSERM; FPGG; ANR [ANR-12-BSV4-0006 CILIASTEM, ANR-10-LABX-54 MEMO LIFE, ANR-11-IDEX-0001-02 PSL]; ARC [PJA-20131200184]; La ligue contre le cancer-comite de Paris [RS14/75-88]; 'Investissements d'Avenir' program of the French Government; City of Paris; FRM; French Ministry of Higher Education and Research","We thank P.

Acute regulation of autophagy by nutrient-sensing kinases is well defined(3,5-7), but longer-term transcriptional regulation is relatively unknown. Here we show that the fed-state sensing nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR)(8,9) and the fasting transcriptional activator cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)(10,11) coordinately regulate the hepatic autophagy gene network. Pharmacological activation of FXR repressed many autophagy genes and inhibited autophagy even in fasted mice, and feeding-mediated inhibition of macroautophagy was attenuated in FXR-knockout mice. From mouse liver chromatin immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing data(12,15), FXR and CREB binding peaks were detected at 178 and 112 genes, respectively, out of 230 autophagy-related genes, and 78 genes showed shared binding, mostly in their promoter regions. CREB promoted autophagic degradation of lipids, or lipophagy(16), under nutrient-deprived conditions, and FXR inhibited this response. Mechanistically, CREB upregulated autophagy genes, including A tg7, Ulkl and Tfeb, by recruiting the coactivator CRTC2. After feeding or pharmacological activation, FXR trans-repressed these genes by disrupting the functional CREB-CRTC2 complex. This study identifies the new FXR-CREB axis as a key physiological switch regulating autophagy, resulting in sustained nutrient regulation of autophagy during feeding/fasting cycles.","[Seok, Sunmi; Fu, Ting; Choi, Sung-E; Kumar, Subodh; Kemper, Byron; Kemper, Jongsook Kim] Univ Illinois, Dept Mol & Integrat Physiol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Choi, Sung-E; Yoon, Gyesoon; Kang, Yup] Ajou Univ, Sch Med, Inst Med Sci, Suwon 442749, South Korea; [Li, Yang; Ma, Jian] Univ Illinois, Dept Bioengn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Li, Yang; Ma, Jian] Univ Illinois, Inst Genome Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Zhu, Rong; Sun, Xiaoxiao; Zhong, Wenxuan] Univ Georgia, Dept Stat, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Kemper, JK (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Dept Mol & Integrat Physiol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",jongsook@illinois.edu,"Li, Yang/F-4020-2012","Li, Yang/0000-0001-5464-4328","National Institutes of Health [DK62777, DK95842]","We thank D.

Its acute regulation by nutrient-sensing signalling pathways is well described, but its longer-term transcriptional regulation is not. The nuclear receptors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR alpha) and farnesoid X receptor (FXR) are activated in the fasted and fed liver, respectively(4,5). Here we show that both PPARa and FXR regulate hepatic autophagy in mice. Pharmacological activation of PPARa reverses the normal suppression of autophagy in the fed state, inducing autophagic lipid degradation, or lipophagy. This response is lost in PPARa knockout (Ppara(-/-), also known as Nr1c1(-/-) mice, which are partially defective in the induction of autophagy by fasting. Pharmacological activation of the bile acid receptor FXR strongly suppresses the induction of autophagy in the fasting state, and this response is absent in FXR knockout (Fxr(-/-), also known as Nr1h4(-/-)) mice, which show a partial defect in suppression of hepatic autophagy in the fed state. PPARa and FXR compete for binding to shared sites in autophagic gene promoters, with opposite transcriptional outputs.

TRIM37 contains a RING finger domain, a hallmark of E3 ubiquitin ligases(2), but its protein substrate(s) is unknown. Here we report that TRIM37 mono-ubiquitinates histone H2A, a chromatin modification associated with transcriptional repression(3). We find that in human breast cancer cell lines containing amplified 17q23, TRIM37 is upregulated and, reciprocally, the major H2A ubiquitin ligase RNF2 (also known as RING1B)(3,4) is downregulated. Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) -chip experiments in 17q23-amplified breast cancer cells identified many genes, including multiple tumour suppressors, whose promoters were bound by TRIM37 and enriched for ubiquitinated H2A. However, unlike RNF2, which is a subunit of polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1)(3-5), we find that TRIM37 associates with polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). TRIM37, PRC2 and PRC I are co-bound to specific target genes, resulting in their transcriptional silencing. RNA-interference-mediated knockdown of TRIM37 results in loss of ubiquitinated H2A, dissociation of PRCI and PRC2 from target promoters, and transcriptional reactivation of silenced genes. Knockdown of TRIM37 in human breast cancer cells containing amplified 17q23 substantially decreases tumour growth in mouse xenografts. Conversely, ectopic expression of TRIM37 renders non-transformed cells tumorigenic. Collectively, our results reveal TRIM37 as an oncogenic H2A ubiquitin ligase that is overexpressed in a subset of breast cancers and promotes transformation by facilitating silencing of tumour suppressors and other genes.","[Bhatnagar, Sanchita; Chamberlain, Lynn; Zhu, Xiaochun; Virbasius, Ching-Man; Lin, Ling; Green, Michael R.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Bhatnagar, Sanchita; Chamberlain, Lynn; Ou, Jianhong; Zhu, Xiaochun; Virbasius, Ching-Man; Lin, Ling; Zhu, Lihua J.; Green, Michael R.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Programs Gene Funct & Express & Mol Med, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Gazin, Claude] CEA DSV iRCM LEFG, Genopole G2, F-91057 Evry, France; [Gazin, Claude] Univ Paris Diderot, F-91057 Evry, France; [Tushir, Jogender S.] Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceut Inc, Ridgefield, CT 06877 USA; [Zhu, Lihua J.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Program Bioinformat & Integrat Biol, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Wajapeyee, Narendra] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Green, MR (reprint author), Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Worcester, MA 01605 USA.",michael.green@umassmed.edu,,"Bhatnagar, Sanchita/0000-0002-3588-7874; Zhu, Lihua/0000-0001-7416-0590",National Lung Cancer Partnership/Uniting Against Lung Cancer; Melanoma Research Alliance; International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer; CEA-DSV; ATIGE Genopole; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); National Institutes of Health [R01GM033977],"We thank C.

It is postulated that mechanically activated cation channels initiate touch sensation, but the identity of these molecules in mammals has been elusive(2). Piezo2 is a rapidly adapting, mechanically activated ion channel expressed in a subset of sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglion and in cutaneous mechanoreceptors known as Merkel-cell-neurite complexes(3,4). It has been demonstrated that Merkel cells have a role in vertebrate mechanosensation using Piezo2, particularly in shaping the type of current sent by the innervating sensory neuron(4-6); however, major aspects of touch sensation remain intact without Merkel cell activity(4,7). Here we show that mice lacking Piezo2 in both adult sensory neurons and Merkel cells exhibit a profound loss of touch sensation. We precisely localize Piezo2 to the peripheral endings of a broad range of low-threshold mechanoreceptors that innervate both hairy and glabrous skin. Most rapidly adapting, mechanically activated currents in dorsal root ganglion neuronal cultures are absent in Piezo2 conditional knockout mice, and ex vivo skin nerve preparation studies show that the mechanosensitivity of low-threshold mechanoreceptors strongly depends on Piezo2. This cellular phenotype correlates with an unprecedented behavioural phenotype: an almost complete deficit in light-touch sensation in multiple behavioural assays, without affecting other somatosensory functions. Our results highlight that a single ion channel that displays rapidly adapting, mechanically activated currents in vitro is responsible for the mechanosensitivity of most low-threshold mechanoreceptor subtypes involved in innocuous touch sensation. Notably, we find that touch and pain sensation are separable, suggesting that as-yet-unknown mechanically activated ion channel(s) must account for noxious (painful) mechanosensation.","[Ranade, Sanjeev S.; Woo, Seung-Hyun; Dubin, Adrienne E.; Coste, Bertrand; Francisco, Allain G.; Reddy, Kritika; Qiu, Zhaozhu; Patapoutian, Ardem] Scripps Res Inst, Dorris Neurosci Ctr, Howard Hughes Med Inst, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Moshourab, Rabih A.; Wetzel, Christiane; Begay, Valerie; Lewin, Gary R.] Max Delbruck Ctr Mol Med, Dept Neurosci, D-13092 Berlin, Germany; [Moshourab, Rabih A.] Univ Med Berlin, Klin Anasthesiol Schwerpunkt Operat Intens Med, Virchow Klinikum Charite, D-13353 Berlin, Germany; [Petrus, Matt; Mathur, Jayanti; Mainquist, James; Wilson, A.

TRAAK (also known as KCNK4) ion channels are neuronally expressed members of the two-pore domain K+ (K2P) channel family and are mechano sensitive'. They are involved in controlling mechanical and temperature nociception in mice'. Mechanosensitivity of TRAAK is mediated directly through the lipid bilayer it is a membrane-tension-gated channel'. However, the molecular mechanism of TRAAK channel gating and mechanosensitivity is unknown. Here we present crystal structures of TRAAK in conductive and non-conductive conformations defined by the presence of permeant ions along the conduction pathway. In the non-conductive state, a lipid acyl chain accesses the channel cavity through a 5 Awide lateral opening in the membrane inner leaflet and physically blocks ion passage. In the conductive state, rotation of a transmembrane helix (TM4) about a central hinge seals the intramembrane opening, preventing lipid block of the cavity and permitting ion entry. Additional rotation of a membrane interacting TM2-TM 3 segment, unique to mechanosensitive K2Ps, against TM4 may further stabilize the conductive conformation. Comparison of the structures reveals a biophysical explanation for TRAAK mechanosensitivity an expansion in cross-sectional area up to 2.7 nm(2) in the conductive state is expected to create a membrane-tension-dependent energy difference between conformations that promotes force activation. Our results show how tension of the lipid bilayer can be harnessed to control gating and mechanosensitivity of a eukaryotic ion channel.","[Brohawn, Stephen G.; Campbell, Ernest B.; MacKinnon, Roderick] Rockefeller Univ, Lab Mol Neurobiol & Biophys, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Brohawn, Stephen G.; Campbell, Ernest B.; MacKinnon, Roderick] Rockefeller Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10065 USA","MacKinnon, R (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Lab Mol Neurobiol & Biophys, 1230 York Ave, New York, NY 10065 USA.",mackinn@rockefeller.edu,,,Howard Hughes Medical Institute,,,40,53,55,4,52,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,4-Dec,2014,516,7529,,,,,126,U345,,10.1038/nature14013,,15,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,AW5JD,WOS:000346310800053,25471887,No,,,11/20/17

Rising incomes and urbanization are driving a global dietary transition in which traditional diets are replaced by diets higher in refined sugars, refined fats, oils and meats. By 2050 these dietary trends, if unchecked, would be a major contributor to an estimated 80 per cent increase in global agricultural greenhouse gas emissions from food production and to global land clearing. Moreover, these dietary shifts are greatly increasing the incidence of type II diabetes, coronary heart disease and other chronic non-communicable diseases that lower global life expectancies. Alternative diets that offer substantial health benefits could, if widely adopted, reduce global agricultural greenhouse gas emissions, reduce land clearing and resultant species extinctions, and help prevent such diet-related chronic non-communicable diseases.

In Drosophila, patterns of transcription factor expression provide spatial cues that induce systematically oriented cell movements and promote tissue elongation. However, the mechanisms by which patterned transcriptional inputs control cell polarity and behaviour have long been elusive. We demonstrate that three Toll family receptors, Toll-2, Toll-6 and Toll-8, are expressed in overlapping transverse stripes along the anterior-posterior axis and act in combination to direct planar polarity and polarized cell rearrangements during convergent extension. Simultaneous disruption of all three receptors strongly reduces actomyosin -driven junctional remodelling and axis elongation, and an ectopic stripe of Toll receptor expression is sufficient to induce planar polarized actomyosin contractility. These results demonstrate that tissue-level patterns of Toll receptor expression provide spatial signals that link positional information from the anterior-posterior patterning system to the essential cell behaviours that drive convergent extension.","[Pare, Adam C.; Vichas, Athea; Fincher, Christopher T.; Mirman, Zachary; Farrell, Dene L.; Mainieri, Avantika; Zallen, Jennifer A.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Pare, Adam C.; Vichas, Athea; Fincher, Christopher T.; Mirman, Zachary; Farrell, Dene L.; Mainieri, Avantika; Zallen, Jennifer A.] Sloan Kettering Inst, Dev Biol Program, New York, NY 10065 USA","Zallen, JA (reprint author), Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10065 USA.",zallenj@mskcc.org,,,"NIH/NIGMS [GM079340, GM102803]","We thank K.

Unfortunately, effective calibration requires accurate knowledge of the distance to NGC 4151, which is not at present available(4). Recently reported distances range from 4 to 29 megaparsecs(5-7). Strong peculiar motions make a redshift-based distance very uncertain, and the geometry of the galaxy and its nucleus prohibit accurate measurements using other techniques. Here we report a dust-parallax distance to NGC 4151 of 19.0+(+2.4)(-2.6) megaparsecs. The measurement is based on an adaptation of a geometric method that uses the emission line regions of active galaxies(8). Because these regions are too small to be imaged with present technology, we use instead the ratio of the physical and angular sizes of the more extended hot-dust emission(9) as determined from time delays(10) and infrared interferometry(11-14). This distance leads to an approximately 1.4-fold increase in the dynamical black hole mass, implying a corresponding correction to emission line reverberation masses of black holes if they are calibrated against the two objects with additional dynamical masses.","[Honig, Sebastian F.; Watson, Darach; Hjorth, Jens] Univ Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Inst, Dark Cosmol Ctr, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark; [Honig, Sebastian F.] Univ Southampton, Sch Phys & Astron, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Kishimoto, Makoto] Kyoto Sangyo Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Phys, Kita Ku, Kyoto 6038555, Japan","Honig, SF (reprint author), Univ Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Inst, Dark Cosmol Ctr, Juliane Maries Vej 30, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark.",s.hoenig@soton.ac.uk,,"Watson, Darach/0000-0002-4465-8264; Hoenig, Sebastian/0000-0002-6353-1111",Marie Curie International Incoming Fellowship within the Seventh European Community Framework Programme [PIIF-GA-2013-623804]; Danish National Research Foundation; NASA,"We thank R.

Subsequent studies(3,4) showed that electrons of moderate energy (less than about one megaelectronvolt) often populate both zones, with a deep 'slot' region largely devoid of particles between them. There is a region of dense cold plasma around the Earth known as the plasmasphere, the outer boundary of which is called the plasmapause. The two-belt radiation structure was explained as arising from strong electron interactions with plasmaspheric hiss just inside the plasmapause boundary(5), with the inner edge of the outer radiation zone corresponding to the minimum plasmapause location(6). Recent observations have revealed unexpected radiation belt morphology(7,8), especially at ultrarelativistic kinetic energies(9,10) (more than five megaelectronvolts). Here we analyse an extended data set that reveals an exceedingly sharp inner boundary for the ultrarelativistic electrons. Additional, concurrently measured data(11) reveal that this barrier to inward electron radial transport does not arise because of a physical boundary within the Earth's intrinsic magnetic field, and that inward radial diffusion is unlikely to be inhibited by scattering by electromagnetic transmitter wave fields. Rather, we suggest that exceptionally slow natural inward radial diffusion combined with weak, but persistent, wave-particle pitch angle scattering deep inside the Earth's plasmasphere can combine to create an almost impenetrable barrier through which the most energetic Van Allen belt electrons cannot migrate.","[Baker, D.

Vanadium dioxide (VO2) exhibits a first-order metal-insulator transition (MIT) near room temperature, where conductivity is suppressed and the lattice changes from tetragonal to monoclinic on cooling. Ongoing attempts to explain this coupled structural and electronic transition begin with two alternative starting points: a Peierls MIT driven by instabilities in electron-lattice dynamics and a Mott MIT where strong electronelectron correlations drive charge localization'. A key missing piece of the VO2 puzzle is the role of lattice vibrations. Moreover, a comprehensive thermodynamic treatment must integrate both entropic and energetic aspects of the transition. Here we report that the entropy driving the MIT in VO2 is dominated by strongly anharmonic phonons rather than electronic contributions, and provide a direct determination of phonon dispersions. Our ab initio calculations identify softer bonding in the tetragonal phase, relative to the monoclinic phase, as the origin of the large vibrational entropy stabilizing the metallic mtile phase. They further reveal how a balance between higher entropy in the metal and orbital-driven lower energy in the insulator fully describes the thermodynamic forces controlling the MIT. Our study illustrates the critical role of anharmonic lattice dynamics in metal oxide phase competition, and provides guidance for the predictive design of new materials.","[Budai, John D.; Hong, Jiawang; Manley, Michael E.; Specht, Eliot D.; Li, Chen W.; Boatner, Lynn A.; Delaire, Olivier] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci & Technol, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Tischler, Jonathan Z.; Said, Ayman H.; Leu, Bogdan M.] Argonne Natl Lab, Adv Photon Source, Argonne, IL 60439 USA; [Abernathy, Douglas L.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Quantum Condensed Matter Div, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [McQueeney, Robert J.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Neutron Sci Directorate, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA","Budai, JD (reprint author), Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci & Technol, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA.",budaijd@ornl.gov; delaireoa@ornl.gov,"; Li, Chen/D-1542-2010; Abernathy, Douglas/A-3038-2012; Manley, Michael/N-4334-2015; McQueeney, Robert/A-2864-2016; Hong, Jiawang/B-2864-2009; Boatner, Lynn/I-6428-2013; BL18, ARCS/A-3000-2012; Budai, John/R-9276-2016","Leu, Bogdan/0000-0003-2020-0686; Li, Chen/0000-0002-0758-5334; Abernathy, Douglas/0000-0002-3533-003X; McQueeney, Robert/0000-0003-0718-5602; Hong, Jiawang/0000-0002-9915-8072; Boatner, Lynn/0000-0002-0235-7594; Budai, John/0000-0002-7444-1306","US Department of Energy (DOE), Basic Energy Sciences (BES), Materials Sciences and Engineering Division (MSED); Center for Accelerating Materials Modeling - US DOE, BES, MSED; Laboratory Directed Research and Development Program of ORNL; US DOE, BES, Scientific User Facilities Division; Scientific User Facilities Division, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, US Department of Energy; US DOE [DE-AC02-06CH11357]; Office of Science of the US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]","Research by J.D.B., O.D., M.E.M., E.D.S., L.A.B. and R.J.M. was supported by the US Department of Energy (DOE), Basic Energy Sciences (BES), Materials Sciences and Engineering Division (MSED).

Molecules have been proposed to replace MOS flash memory(1), but they suffer from low electrical conductivity, high resistance, low device yield, and finite thermal stability, limiting their integration into current MOS technologies. Although great advances have been made in the pursuit of molecule-based flash memory(2), there are a number of significant barriers to the realization of devices using conventional MOS technologies(3-7). Here we show that core-shell polyoxometalate (POM) molecules(8) can act as candidate storage nodes for MOS flash memory. Realistic, industry-standard device simulations validate our approach at the nanometre scale, where the device performance is determined mainly by the number of molecules in the storage media and not by their position. To exploit the nature of the core-shell POM clusters, we show, at both the molecular and device level, that embedding [(Se(IV)O-3)(2)](4-) as an oxidizable dopant in the cluster core allows the oxidation of the molecule to a [Se(V)(2)O-6](2-) moiety containing a {Se(v)-Se(v)} bond (where curly brackets indicate a moiety, not a molecule) and reveals a new 5 + oxidation state for selenium. This new oxidation state can be observed at the device level, resulting in a new type of memory, which we call 'write-once-erase'. Taken together, these results show that POMs have the potential to be used as a realistic nanoscale flash memory. Also, the configuration of the doped POM core may lead to new types of electrical behaviour(9-11). This work suggests a route to the practical integration of configurable molecules in MOS technologies as the lithographic scales approach the molecular limit(12).","[Busche, Christoph; Vila-Nadal, Laia; Yan, Jun; Miras, Haralampos N.; Long, De-Liang; Cronin, Leroy] Univ Glasgow, Sch Chem, WestCHEM, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Georgiev, Vihar P.; Asenov, Asen; Pedersen, Rasmus H.; Gadegaard, Nikolaj; Mirza, Muhammad M.; Paul, Douglas J.] Univ Glasgow, Sch Engn, Glasgow G12 8LT, Lanark, Scotland; [Poblet, Josep M.] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Quim Fis & Inorgan, E-43007 Tarragona, Spain","Cronin, L (reprint author), Univ Glasgow, Sch Chem, WestCHEM, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",lee.cronin@glasgow.ac.uk,"; Paul, Douglas/F-7116-2014; Vila-Nadal, Laia/I-9063-2014; Cronin, Leroy/B-7752-2008; Gadegaard, Nikolaj/E-9243-2010; Miras, Haralampos/C-1691-2008; Long, Deliang/C-3500-2011; Poblet, Josep M./A-2739-2008; Miras, Haralampos/C-6345-2014","Georgiev, Vihar/0000-0001-6473-2508; Paul, Douglas/0000-0001-7402-8530; Vila-Nadal, Laia/0000-0002-7718-7227; Cronin, Leroy/0000-0001-8035-5757; Gadegaard, Nikolaj/0000-0002-3396-846X; Miras, Haralampos/0000-0002-0086-5173; Poblet, Josep M./0000-0002-4533-0623; Miras, Haralampos/0000-0002-0086-5173","EPSRC [EP/H024107/1, EP/I033459/1, EP/J015156/1]; COST Action [CM1203]; Royal Society Wolfson Foundation for a Merit Award; University of Glasgow","We gratefully acknowledge financial support from the EPSRC for funding (grants EP/H024107/1, EP/I033459/1 and EP/J015156/1), the COST Action CM1203 (PoCheMoN), the Royal Society Wolfson Foundation for a Merit Award, and the University of Glasgow.

To improve our understanding of ENSO's sensitivity to external climate forcing, it is paramount to determine its past behaviour by using palaeoclimate data and model simulations. Palaeoclimate records show that ENSO has varied considerably since the Last Glacial Maximum (21,000 years ago)(2-9), and some data sets suggest a gradual intensification of ENS 0 over the past 6,000 years(2'5'7'8). Previous attempts to simulate the transient evolution of ENSO have relied on simplified models(10) or snapshot(11-13) experiments. Here we analyse a series of transient Coupled General Circulation Model simulations forced by changes in greenhouse gasses, orbital forcing, the meltwater discharge and the ice-sheet history throughout the past 21,000 years. Consistent with most palaeo-ENSO reconstructions, our model simulates an orbitally induced strengthening of ENSO during the Holocene epoch, which is caused by increasing positive ocean-atmosphere feedbacks. During the early deglaciation, ENSO characteristics change drastically in response to meltwater discharges and the resulting changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and equatorial annual cycle. Increasing deglacial atmospheric CO2 concentrations tend to weaken ENSO, whereas retreating glacial ice sheets intensify ENSO. The complex evolution of forcings and ENSO feedbacks and the uncertainties in the reconstruction further highlight the challenge and opportunity for constraining future ENSO responses.","[Liu, Zhengyu] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Liu, Zhengyu] Univ Wisconsin, Nelson Ctr Climat Res, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Liu, Zhengyu; Lu, Zhengyao; Wen, Xinyu] Peking Univ, Sch Phys, Lab Climate Ocean & Atmosphere Studies, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Otto-Bliesner, B.

Single-molecule protein detection using optical methods(5) is limited by the number of spectrally non-overlapping chromophores. Here we introduce a single-molecular-interaction sequencing (SMI-seq) technology for parallel protein interaction profiling leveraging single-molecule advantages. DNA barcodes are attached to proteins collectively via ribosome display(6) or individually via enzymatic conjugation. Barcoded proteins are assayed en masse in aqueous solution and subsequently immobilized in a polyacrylamide thin film to construct a random single-molecule array, where barcoding DNAs are amplified into in situ polymerase colonies (polonies)(7) and analysed by DNA sequencing. This method allows precise quantification of various proteins with a theoretical maximum array density of over one million polonies per square millimetre. Furthermore, protein interactions can be measured on the basis of the statistics of colocalized polonies arising from barcoding DNAs of interacting proteins. Two demanding applications, G-protein coupled receptor and antibody-binding profiling, are demonstrated. SMI-seq enables 'library versus library' screening in a one-pot assay, simultaneously interrogating molecular binding affinity and specificity.","[Gu, Liangcai; Aach, John; Hill, David E.; Vidal, Marc; Church, George M.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Li, Chao; Church, George M.] Harvard Univ, Wyss Inst Biol Inspired Engn, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Hill, David E.; Vidal, Marc] Dana Farber Canc Inst, CCSB, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Hill, David E.; Vidal, Marc] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Biol, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Gu, LC (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",liangcaigu@gmail.com; gchurch@genetics.med.harvard.edu,,"church, george/0000-0001-6232-9969",US Department of Energy [DE-FG02-02ER63445]; NIH NHGRI [HG001715]; Jane Coffin Childs Fund for Medical Research; Harvard Origins of Life Initiative,"This work was supported by a grant from the US Department of Energy (DE-FG02-02ER63445) to G.M.C. and a grant from the NIH NHGRI (HG001715) to M.V. and D.E.H.L.G. was supported by a postdoctoral fellowship from the Jane Coffin Childs Fund for Medical Research and a grant from Harvard Origins of Life Initiative.

Chemotherapy is still the standard of care. Patient outcomes, especially for those in whom chemotherapy is not effective or is poorly tolerated, remain poor(1,2). One hallmark of UBC is the presence of high rates of somatic mutations(3,5). These alterations may enhance the ability of the host immune system to recognize tumour cells as foreign owing to an increased number of antigens(6). However, these cancers may also elude immune surveillance and eradication through the expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-Li; also called CD274 or B7-H1) in the tumour microenvironment(7,8). Therefore, we examined the anti-PDLi antibody MPDL3280A, a systemic cancer immunotherapy, for the treatment of metastatic UBC. MPDL3280A is a high-affinity engineered human anti-PD-L1 monoclonal immunoglobulin-Gl antibody that inhibits the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 (PDCD1) and B7.1 (CD80)9. Because PD-L1 is expressed on activated T cells, MPDL3280A was engineered with a modification in the Fc domain that eliminates antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity at clinically relevant doses to prevent the depletion of T cells expressing PD-Li. Here we show that MPDL3280A has noteworthy activity in metastatic UBC. Responses were often rapid, with many occurring at the time of the first response assessment (6 weeks) and nearly all were ongoing at the data cutoff. This phase I expansion study, with an adaptive design that allowed for biomarker-positive enriched cohorts, demonstrated that tumours expressing PD-L1 -positive tumour-infiltrating immune cells had particularly high response rates. Moreover, owing to the favourable toxicity profile, including a lack of renal toxicity, patients with UBC, who are often older and have a higher incidence of renal impairment, may be better able to tolerate MPDL3280A versus chemotherapy. These results suggest that MPDL3280A may have an important role in treating UBC-the drug received breakthrough designation status by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in June 2014.","[Powles, Thomas] Queen Mary Univ London, Barts Canc Inst, Barts Expt Canc Med Ctr, London EC1M 6BQ, England; [Eder, Joseph Paul; Petrylak, Daniel P.] Yale Canc Ctr, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Fine, Gregg D.; Teng, Siew-Leng; Shen, Xiaodong; Boyd, Zachary; Hegde, Priti S.; Chen, Daniel S.] Genentech Inc, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Braiteh, Fadi S.] Comprehens Canc Ctr Nevada, Las Vegas, NV 89169 USA; [Loriot, Yohann] Gustave Roussy, F-94805 Villejuif, France; [Cruz, Cristina] VHIO, Barcelona 08035, Spain; [Cruz, Cristina] Vall dHebron Univ Hosp, Barcelona 08035, Spain; [Bellmunt, Joaquim] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Bladder Canc Ctr, Dana Farber Brigham & Womens Canc Ctr, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Burris, Howard A.] Sarah Cannon Res Inst, Nashville, TN 37203 USA; [Vogelzang, Nicholas J.] Univ Nevada, Sch Med, Las Vegas, NV 89169 USA; [Vogelzang, Nicholas J.] Univ Nevada, US Oncol Comprehens Canc Ctr Nevada, Las Vegas, NV 89169 USA","Powles, T (reprint author), Queen Mary Univ London, Barts Canc Inst, Barts Expt Canc Med Ctr, London EC1M 6BQ, England.",Thomas.Powles@bartshealth.nhs.uk,,,,,,27,755,791,22,151,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,27-Nov,2014,515,7528,,,,,558,+,,10.1038/nature13904,,12,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,AW4JP,WOS:000346247600052,25428503,No,Y,N,11/20/17

These changes distinguish cancer cells from their normal counterparts, allowing tumours to be recognized as foreign by the immune system(1-4). However, tumours are rarely rejected spontaneously, reflecting their ability to maintain an immunosuppressive microenvironmen(5). Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-Li; also called B7-H1 or CD274), which is expressed on many cancer and immune cells, plays an important part in blocking the 'cancer immunity cycle' by binding programmed death-1 (PD-1) and B7.1 (CD80), both of which are negative regulators of T-lymphocyte activation. Binding of PD-L1 to its receptors suppresses T-cell migration, proliferation and secretion of cytotoxic mediators, and restricts tumour cell killing(6-10). The PD -LI-PD -1 axis protects the host from overactive T-effector cells not only in cancer but also during microbial infections(11). Blocking PD-L1 should therefore enhance anticancer immunity, but little is known about predictive factors of efficacy. This study was designed to evaluate the safety, activity and biomarkers of PD-L1 inhibition using the engineered humanized antibody MPDL3280A. Here we show that across multiple cancer types, responses (as evaluated by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours, version 1.1) were observed in patients with tumours expressing high levels of PD-L1, especially when PD-L1 was expressed by tumour-infiltrating immune cells. Furthermore, responses were associated with T-helper type 1 (T(H)1) gene expression, CTLA4 expression and the absence of fractalkine (CX3CL1) in baseline tumour specimens. Together, these data suggest that MPDL3280A is most effective in patients in which pre-existing immunity is suppressed by PD-L1, and is re-invigorated on antibody treatment.","[Herbst, Roy S.; Gettinger, Scott N.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Yale Comprehens Canc Ctr, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Soria, Jean-Charles] Gustave Roussy South Paris Univ, F-94805 Villejuif, France; [Kowanetz, Marcin; Fine, Gregg D.; Rost, Sandra; Leabman, Maya; Xiao, Yuanyuan; Mokatrin, Ahmad; Koeppen, Hartmut; Hegde, Priti S.; Mellman, Ira; Chen, Daniel S.] Genentech Inc, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Hamid, Omid] Angeles Clin & Res Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90025 USA; [Gordon, Michael S.] Pinnacle Oncol Hematol, Scottsdale, AZ 85258 USA; [Sosman, Jeffery A.; Horn, Leora] Vanderbilt Ingram Canc Ctr, Nashville, TN 37212 USA; [McDermott, David F.] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Powderly, John D.] Carolina BioOncol Inst, Huntersville, NC 28078 USA; [Kohrt, Holbrook E.

One mechanism by which cancer tissues limit the host immune response is via upregulation of PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) and its ligation to PD-1 on antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells (termed adaptive immune resistance)7. Here we show that pre-existing CD8(+) T cells distinctly located at the invasive tumour margin are associated with expression of the PD-1/PD-Li immune inhibitory axis and may predict response to therapy. We analysed samples from 46 patients with metastatic melanoma obtained before and during anti-PD-1 therapy (pembrolizumab) using quantitative immunohistochemistry, quantitative multiplex immunofluorescence, and nextgeneration sequencing for T-cell antigen receptors (TCRs). In serially sampled tumours, patients responding to treatment showed proliferation of intratumoral CD8(+) T cells that directly correlated with radiographic reduction in tumour size. Pre-treatment samples obtained from responding patients showed higher numbers of CD8-, PD-1- and PD-L1-expressing cells at the invasive tumour margin and inside tumours, with close proximity between PD-1 and PD-L1, and a more clonal TCR repertoire. Using multivariate analysis, we established a predictive model based on CD8(+) expression at the invasive margin and validated the model in an independent cohort of 15 patients. Our findings indicate that tumour regression after therapeutic PD-1 blockade requires pre-existing CD8 T cells that are negatively regulated by PD-1 /PD-Li-mediated adaptive immune resistance.","[Tumeh, Paul C.; Harview, Christina L.; Shintaku, I.

If presented on major histocompatibility complex class I molecules (MHCI), peptides containing these mutations could potentially be immunogenic as they should be recognized as 'non-self neo-antigens by the adaptive immune system. Recent work has confirmed that mutant peptides can serve as T-cell epitopes'. However, few mutant epitopes have been described because their discovery required the laborious screening of patient tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes for their ability to recognize antigen libraries constructed following tumour exome sequencing. We sought to simplify the discovery of immunogenic mutant peptides by characterizing their general properties. We developed an approach that combines whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing analysis with mass spectrometry to identify neo-epitopes in two widely used murine tumour models. Of the >1,300 amino acid changes identified, 13% were predicted to bind MH CI, a small fraction of which were confirmed by mass spectrometry. The peptides were then structurally modelled bound to MHCI. Mutations that were solvent-exposed and therefore accessible to T-cell antigen receptors were predicted to be immunogenic. Vaccination of mice confirmed the approach, with each predicted immunogenic peptide yielding therapeutically active T-cell responses. The predictions also enabled the generation of peptide-MHCI dextramers that could be used to monitor the kinetics and distribution of the anti-tumour T-cell response before and after vaccination. These findings indicate that a suitable prediction algorithm may provide an approach for the pharmacodynamic monitoring of T-cell responses as well as for the development of personalized vaccines in cancer patients.","[Yadav, Mahesh; Jhunjhunwala, Suchit; Phung, Qui T.; Lupardus, Patrick; Tanguay, Joshua; Bumbaca, Stephanie; Franci, Christian; Cheung, Tommy K.; Modrusan, Zora; Mellman, Ira; Lill, Jennie R.; Delamarre, Lelia] Genentech Inc, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Fritsche, Jens; Weinschenk, Toni] Immat Biotechnol GmbH, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany","Delamarre, L (reprint author), Genentech Inc, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA.",lill.jennie@gene.com; delamarre.lelia@gene.com,,"Fritsche, J./0000-0002-5557-8577",,,,38,228,236,17,86,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,27-Nov,2014,515,7528,,,,,572,+,,10.1038/nature14001,,16,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,AW4JP,WOS:000346247600055,25428506,No,Y,N,11/20/17

Yet, clinically apparent cancers still arise in immunocompetent individuals in part as a consequence of cancer-induced immunosuppression. In many individuals, immunosuppression is mediated by cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and programmed death-1 (PD -1), two immunomodulatory receptors expressed on T cells(8,9). Monoclonal-antibody-based therapies targeting CTLA-4 and/or PD-1 (checkpoint blockade) have yielded significant clinical benefits including durable responses to patients with different malignancies(10-13). However, little is known about the identity of the tumour antigens that function as the targets of T cells activated by checkpoint blockade immunotherapy and whether these antigens can be used to generate vaccines that are highly tumour-specific. Here we use genomics and bioinformatics approaches to identify tumour-specific mutant proteins as a major class of T-cell rejection antigens following anti-PD-1 and/or anti-CTLA-4 therapy of mice bearing progressively growing sarcomas, and we show that therapeutic synthetic long-peptide vaccines incorporating these mutant epitopes induce tumour rejection comparably to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. Although mutant tumour-antigen-specific T cells are present in progressively growing tumours, they are reactivated following treatment with anti-PD-1 and/or anti-CTLA-4 and display some overlapping but mostly treatment-specific transcriptional profiles, rendering them capable of mediating tumour rejection. These results reveal that tumour-specific mutant antigens are not only important targets of checkpoint blockade therapy, but they can also be used to develop personalized cancer-specific vaccines and to probe the mechanistic","[Gubin, Matthew M.; Ward, Jeffrey P.; Noguchi, Takuro; Ivanova, Yulia; Arthur, Cora D.; Vesely, Matthew D.; Lam, Samuel S.

Epigenetic mechanisms regulate both types of consolidation(2-7), but histone variant exchange, in which canonical histones are replaced with their variant counterparts, is an entire branch of epigenetics that has received limited attention in the brain(8-12) and has never, to our knowledge, been studied in relation to cognitive function. Here we show that histone H2A.Z, a variant of histone H2A, is actively exchanged in response to fear conditioning in the hippocampus and the cortex, where it mediates gene expression and restrains the formation of recent and remote memory. Our data provide evidence for H2A.Z involvement in cognitive function and specifically implicate H2A.Z as a negative regulator of hippocampal consolidation and systems consolidation, probably through downstream effects on gene expression. Moreover, alterations in H2A.Z binding at later stages of systems consolidation suggest that this histone has the capacity to mediate stable molecular modifications required for memory retention. Overall, our data introduce histone variant exchange as a novel mechanism contributing to the molecular basis of cognitive function and implicate H2A.Z as a potential therapeutic target for memory disorders.","[Zovkic, Iva B.; Paulukaitis, Brynna S.; Day, Jeremy J.; Etikala, Deepa M.; Sweatt, J.

In plants, the germ line arises from somatic tissues of the flower, necessitating the erasure of chromatin modifications that have accumulated at specific loci during development or in response to external stimuli. If this process occurs inefficiently, it can lead to epigenetic states being inherited from one generation to the next(2-4). However, inmost cases, accumulated epigenetic modifications are efficiently erased before the next generation. An important example of epigenetic reprogramming in plants is the resetting of the expression of the floral repressor locus FLC in Arabidopsis thaliana. FLC is epigenetically silenced by prolonged cold in a process called vernalization. However, the locus is reactivated before the completion of seed development, ensuring the requirement for vernalization in every generation. In contrast to our detailed understanding of the polycomb-mediated epigenetic silencing induced by vernalization, little is known about the mechanism involved in the reactivation of FLC. Here we show that a hypomorphic mutation in the jumonji-domain-containing protein ELF6 impaired the reactivation of FLC in reproductive tissues, leading to the inheritance of a partially vernalized state. ELF6 has H3K27 me3 demethylase activity, and the mutation reduced this enzymatic activity in planta. Consistent with this, in the next generation of mutant plants, H3K27me3 levels at the FLC locus stayed higher, and FLC expression remained lower, than in the wild type. Our data reveal an ancient role for H3K27 demethylation in the reprogramming of epigenetic states in plant and mammalian embryos(5-7).","[Crevillen, Pedro; Yang, Hongchun; Greeff, Christiaan; Trick, Martin; Dean, Caroline] John Innes Ctr Plant Sci Res, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Norwich NR4 7UH, Norfolk, England; [Cui, Xia; Qiu, Qi; Cao, Xiaofeng] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Plant Genom, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Cui, Xia; Qiu, Qi; Cao, Xiaofeng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Genet & Dev Biol, Natl Ctr Plant Gene Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Dean, C (reprint author), John Innes Ctr Plant Sci Res, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7UH, Norfolk, England.",caroline.dean@jic.ac.uk,"Crevillen, Pedro/G-7113-2012","Crevillen, Pedro/0000-0003-1276-9792; Dean, Caroline/0000-0002-6555-3525","UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/G009562/1, BB/C517633/1]; European Research Council [233039 ENVGENE]; National Basic Research Program of China [2013CB967300, 2011CB915400]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31271363]",We thank Dean laboratory members and A.

The residues essential for primer annealing are initially locked in intramolecular interactions(3-5); hence, annealing requires the chaperone activity of the retroviral nucleocapsid (NC) protein to facilitate structural rearrangements(6). Here we show that, unlike classical chaperones, the Moloney murine leukaemia virus NC uses a unique mechanism for remodelling: it specifically targets multiple structured regions in both the U5-PBS and tRNA(Pro) primer that otherwise sequester residues necessary for annealing. This high-specificity and high-affinity binding by NC consequently liberates these sequestered residues-which are exactly complementary-for intermolecular interactions. Furthermore, NC utilizes a step-wise, entropy-driven mechanism to trigger both residue-specific destabilization and residue-specific release. Our structures of NC bound to U5-PBS and tRNAPro reveal the structure-based mechanism for retroviral primer annealing and provide in sights as to how ATP-independent chaperones can target specific RNAs amidst the cellular milieu of non-target RNAs.

To quantify cis-versus trans-acting contributions to mammalian regulatory evolution, we performed genomic DNase I footprinting of the mouse genome across 25 cell and tissue types, collectively defining similar to 8.6 million transcription factor (TF) occupancy sites at nucleotide resolution. Here we show that mouse TF footprints conjointly encode a regulatory lexicon that is similar to 95% similar with that derived from human TF footprints. However, only similar to 20% of mouse TF footprints have human orthologues. Despite substantial turnover of the cis-regulatory landscape, nearly half of all pairwise regulatory interactions connecting mouse TF genes have been maintained in orthologous human cell types through evolutionary innovation of TF recognition sequences. Furthermore, the higher-level organization of mouse TF-to-TF connections into cellular network architectures is nearly identical with human. Our results indicate that evolutionary selection on mammalian gene regulation is targeted chiefly at the level of trans-regulatory circuitry, enabling and potentiating cis-regulatory plasticity.","[Stergachis, Andrew B.; Neph, Shane; Sandstrom, Richard; Haugen, Eric; Reynolds, Alex P.; Canfield, Theresa; Stelhing-Sun, Sandra; Lee, Kristen; Thurman, Robert E.; Vong, Shinny; Bates, Daniel; Neri, Fidencio; Diegel, Morgan; Giste, Erika; Dunn, Douglas; Vierstra, Jeff; Hansen, R.

By combining the genome-wide transcription factor occupancy repertoires, associated epigenetic signals, and co-association patterns, here we deduce several evolutionary principles of gene regulatory features operating since the mouse and human lineages diverged. The genomic distribution profiles, primary binding motifs, chromatin states, and DNA methylation preferences are well conserved for TF-occupied sequences. However, the extent to which orthologous DNA segments are bound by orthologous TFs varies both among TFs and with genomic location: binding at promoters is more highly conserved than binding at distal elements. Notably, occupancy-conserved TF-occupied sequences tend to be pleiotropic; they function in several tissues and also co-associate with many TFs. Single nucleotide variants at sites with potential regulatory functions are enriched in occupancy-conserved TF-occupied sequences.","[Cheng, Yong; Ma, Zhihai; Cayting, Philip; Boyle, Alan P.; Li, Jingjing; Euskirchen, Ghia; Lin, Shin; Lin, Yiing; Kawli, Trupti; Yang, Xinqiong; Patacsil, Dorrelyn; Kundaje, Anshul; Snyder, Michael P.] Stanford Univ, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kim, Bong-Hyun; Weng, Zhiping] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Pharmacol, Program Bioinformat & Integrat Biol, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Wu, Weisheng; Dogan, Nergiz; Keller, Cheryl A.; Giardine, Belinda; Hardison, Ross C.] Penn State Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Huck Inst Life Sci, Ctr Comparat Genom & Bioinformat, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Wu, Weisheng] Univ Michigan, BRCF Bioinformat Core, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USA; [Sundaram, Vasavi; Xing, Xiaoyun; Wang, Ting] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Genome Sci & Syst Biol, Dept Genet, St Louis, MO 63108 USA; [Lin, Shin] Stanford Univ, Div Cardiovasc Med, Stanford, CA 94304 USA; [Lin, Yiing] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Surg, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Visel, Axel; Pennacchio, Len A.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Genom Div, Berkeley, CA 94701 USA; [Visel, Axel; Pennacchio, Len A.] Dept Energy Joint Genome Inst, Walnut Creek, CA 94598 USA; [Visel, Axel] Univ Calif, Sch Nat Sci, Merced, CA 95343 USA","Snyder, MP (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",rch8@psu.edu; mpsnyder@stanford.edu,"; Ma, Zhihai/E-7130-2015; cheng, yong/I-4270-2012; Pervouchine, Dmitri/H-5252-2015; Kumar, Swathi/I-7941-2015; Tanzer, Andrea/L-3147-2015; Li, Jingjing/B-5136-2016; Boyle, Alan/I-1848-2014; Visel, Axel/A-9398-2009","Lagarde, Julien/0000-0002-0290-7445; Herrero, Javier/0000-0001-7313-717X; Edsall, Lee Elizabeth/0000-0002-0326-2829; Zhou, Xiao-Qiao/0000-0002-0724-5153; Bussotti, Giovanni/0000-0002-4078-7413; Pervouchine, Dmitri/0000-0003-0543-9760; Kumar, Swathi/0000-0002-2770-5145; Tanzer, Andrea/0000-0003-2873-4236; Li, Jingjing/0000-0001-6025-9522; Boyle, Alan/0000-0002-2081-1105; Visel, Axel/0000-0002-4130-7784; Samstein, Robert/0000-0001-6860-2401","National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) [R01HG003988, U54HG006997]; American Recovery and Reinvestment Act; Department of Energy, University of California [DE-AC02-05CH11231];  [3RC2HG005602];  [5U54HG006996];  [1U54HG00699];  [R01DK065806];  [RC2HG005573]","This work is funded by grants 3RC2HG005602, 5U54HG006996 and 1U54HG00699 (M.

The physical mechanism underlying the contribution from the magnetic field is the torque exerted on the rotating black hole by the field amplified by the accreting material. If the squared magnetic field is proportional to the accretion rate, then there will be a correlation between jet power and accretion luminosity. There is evidence for such a correlation(2-8), but inadequate knowledge of the accretion luminosity of the limited and inhomogeneous samples used prevented a firm conclusion. Here we report an analysis of archival observations of a sample of blazars (quasars whose jets point towards Earth) that overcomes previous limitations. We find a clear correlation between jet power, as measured through the gamma-ray luminosity, and accretion luminosity, as measured by the broad emission lines, with the jet power dominating the disk luminosity, in agreement with numerical simulations(9). This implies that the magnetic field threading the black hole horizon reaches the maximum value sustainable by the accreting matter(10).","[Ghisellini, G.; Tavecchio, F.; Maraschi, L.; Celotti, A.; Sbarrato, T.] Ist Nazl Astrofis, Osservatorio Astron Brera, I-23807 Merate, Italy; [Maraschi, L.] Ist Nazl Astrofis, Osservatorio Astron Brera, I-20121 Milan, Italy; [Celotti, A.] Scuola Int Super Studi Avanzati, I-34135 Trieste, Italy; [Celotti, A.] Ist Nazl Fis Nucl, Sez Trieste, I-34127 Trieste, Italy; [Sbarrato, T.] Univ Insubria, Dipartimento Fis & Matemat, I-22100 Como, Italy; [Sbarrato, T.] European So Observ, D-8578 Garching, Germany","Ghisellini, G (reprint author), Ist Nazl Astrofis, Osservatorio Astron Brera, Via E Bianchi 46, I-23807 Merate, Italy.",gabriele.ghisellini@brera.inaf.it,,"Ghisellini, Gabriele/0000-0002-0037-1974; Tavecchio, Fabrizio/0000-0003-0256-0995; Sbarrato, Tullia/0000-0002-3069-9399",PRIN-INAF grant,F.T. and L.

An objective of materials research is to achieve enhanced control over the physical properties of materials such as ferromagnets(1), ferroelectrics(2) and superconductors(3). In this context, complex oxides and inorganic perovskites are attractive because slight adjustments of their atomic structures can produce large physical responses and result in multiple functionalities(4,5). In addition, these materials often contain ferroelastic domains(6). The intrinsic symmetry breaking that takes place at the domain walls can induce properties absent from the domains themselves(7), such as magnetic or ferroelectric order and other functionalities, as well as coupling between them. Moreover, large domain wall densities create intense strain gradients, which can also affect the material's properties(8,9). Here we show that, owing to large local stresses, domain walls can promote the formation of unusual phases. In this sense, the domain walls can function as nanoscale chemical reactors. We synthesize a two-dimensional ferromagnetic phase at the domain walls of the orthorhombic perovskite terbium manganite (TbMnO3), which was grown in thin layer sunder epitaxial strain on strontium titanate (SrTiO3) substrates. This phase is yet to be created by standard chemical routes. The density of the two-dimensional sheets can be tuned by changing the film thickness or the substrate lattice parameter (that is, the epitaxial strain), and the distance between sheets can be made as small as 5 nanometres in ultrathin films(10,) such that the new phase at domain walls represents up to 25 per cent of the film volume. The general concept of using domain walls of epitaxial oxides to promote the formation of unusual phases may be applicable to other materials systems, thus giving access to new classes of nanoscale materials for applications in nanoelectronics and spintronics.","[Farokhipoor, S.; Daumont, C.

Over the past 25 years, device performance has improved greatly as a wide variety of molecular structures have been studied(1). However, one major limitation has not been overcome; transport properties in polymer films are still limited by pervasive conformational and energetic disorder(2-5). This not only limits the rational design of materials with higher performance, but also prevents the study of physical phenomena associated with an extended pi-electron delocalization along the polymer backbone. Here we report a comparative transport study of several high-mobility conjugated polymers by field-effect-modulated Seebeck, transistor and sub-bandgap optical absorption measurements. We show that in several of these polymers, most notably in a recently reported, indacenodithiophene-based donor-acceptor copolymer with a near-amorphous microstructure(6), the charge transport properties approach intrinsic disorder-free limits at which all molecular sites are thermally accessible. Molecular dynamics simulations identify the origin of this long sought-after regime as a planar, torsion-free backbone conformation that is surprisingly resilient to side-chain disorder. Our results provide molecular-design guidelines for 'disorder-free' conjugated polymers.","[Venkateshvaran, Deepak; Nikolka, Mark; Sadhanala, Aditya; Zelazny, Mateusz; Kronemeijer, Auke Jisk; Pecunia, Vincenzo; Nasrallah, Iyad; Romanov, Igor; Broch, Katharina; Sirringhaus, Henning] Univ Cambridge, Cavendish Lab, Optoelect Grp, Cambridge CB3 0HE, England; [Lemaur, Vincent; Olivier, Yoann; Cornil, Jerome; Beljonne, David] Univ Mons, Lab Chem Novel Mat, B-7000 Mons, Belgium; [Kepa, Michal] Univ Edinburgh, Ctr Sci Extreme Condit, Edinburgh EH9 3JZ, Midlothian, Scotland; [Hurhangee, Michael; McCulloch, Iain] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Chem, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Hurhangee, Michael; McCulloch, Iain] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Ctr Plast Elect, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Emin, David] Univ New Mexico, Dept Phys & Astron, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA","Sirringhaus, H (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Cavendish Lab, Optoelect Grp, JJ Thomson Ave, Cambridge CB3 0HE, England.",hs220@cam.ac.uk,"Pecunia, Vincenzo/D-2588-2016; Olivier, Yoann/P-9176-2017","Olivier, Yoann/0000-0003-2193-1536; McCulloch, Iain/0000-0002-6340-7217; Broch, Katharina/0000-0002-9354-292X; Sirringhaus, Henning/0000-0001-9827-6061; Sadhanala, Aditya/0000-0003-2832-4894; Pecunia, Vincenzo/0000-0003-3244-1620",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/G060738/1]; Technology Strategy Board (PORSCHED project); Cambridge Commonwealth Trust through Cambridge International Scholarship; German Research Foundation; NanoDTC in Cambridge; European Commission/Region Wallonne (FEDER - Smartfilm RF project); Interuniversity Attraction Pole programme of the Belgian Federal Science Policy Office [PAI 7/05]; Programme d'Excellence de la Region Wallonne (OPTI2MAT project); FNRS-FRFC,"We gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council through a programme grant (EP/G060738/1) and the Technology Strategy Board (PORSCHED project).

This coordination, which can lead to catalyst poisoning or C-H functionalization at an undesired position, limits the application of C-H activation reactions in heterocycle-based drug discovery(1-5), in which regard they have attracted much interest from pharmaceutical companies(3-5). Here we report a robust and synthetically useful method that overcomes the complications associated with performing C-H functionalization reactions on heterocycles. Our approach employs a simple N-methoxy amide group, which serves as both a directing group and an anionic ligand that promotes the in situ generation of the reactive PdX2 (X = ArCONOMe) species from a Pd(0) source using air as the sole oxidant. In this way, the PdX2 species is localized near the target C-H bond, avoiding interference from any nitrogen or sulphur atoms present in the heterocyclic substrates. This reaction overrides the conventional positional selectivity patterns observed with substrates containing strongly coordinating heteroatoms, including nitrogen, sulphur and phosphorus. Thus, this operationally simple aerobic reaction demonstrates that it is possible to bypass a fundamental limitation that has long plagued applications of directed C-H activation in medicinal chemistry.","[Liu, Yue-Jin; Xu, Hui; Kong, Wei-Jun; Shang, Ming; Dai, Hui-Xiong; Yu, Jin-Quan] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Organ Chem, State Key Lab Organometall Chem, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China; [Yu, Jin-Quan] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Chem, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Dai, HX (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Organ Chem, State Key Lab Organometall Chem, 345 Lingling Rd, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China.",hxdai@sioc.ac.cn; yu200@scripps.edu,,,Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry; Chinese Academy of Sciences; CAS/SAFEA International Partnership Program for Creative Research Teams; National Natural Science Foundation of China [NSFC-21121062]; Recruitment Program of Global Experts; Scripps Research Institute; NIH (NIGMS) [1R01 GM102265],"We thank the following for financial support: the Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the CAS/SAFEA International Partnership Program for Creative Research Teams, the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant NSFC-21121062), the Recruitment Program of Global Experts, the Scripps Research Institute and the NIH (NIGMS,1R01 GM102265).",,30,114,115,19,183,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,20-Nov,2014,515,7527,,,,,389,393,,10.1038/nature13885,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,AU7HE,WOS:000345770600040,25383516,No,Y,N,11/20/17

The CO2 seasonal amplitude has increased over the past five decades, suggesting an increase in Northern Hemisphere biospheric activity(2,5,6). It has been proposed that vegetation growth may have been stimulated by higher concentrations of CO2 as well as by warming in recent decades, but such mechanisms have been unable to explain the full range and magnitude of the observed increase in CO2 seasonal amplitude(2,6-13). Here we suggest that the intensification of agriculture (the Green Revolution, in which much greater crop yield per unit area was achieved by hybridization, irrigation and fertilization) during the past five decades is a driver of changes in the seasonal characteristics of the global carbon cycle. Our analysis of CO2 data and atmospheric inversions shows a robust 15 per cent long-term increase in CO2 seasonal amplitude from 1961 to 2010, punctuated by large decadal and interannual variations. Using a terrestrial carbon cycle model that takes into account high-yield cultivars, fertilizer use and irrigation, we find that the long-term increase in CO2 seasonal amplitude arises from two major regions: the midlatitude cropland between 25 degrees N and 60 degrees N and the high-latitude natural vegetation between 50 degrees N and 70 degrees N. The long-term trend of seasonal amplitude increase is 0.311 +/- 0.027 per cent per year, of which sensitivity experiments attribute 45,29 and 26 per cent to land-use change, climate variability and change, and increased productivity due to CO2 fertilization, respectively. Vegetation growth was earlier by one to two weeks, as measured by the mid-point of vegetation carbon uptake, and took up 0.5 petagrams more carbon in July, the height of the growing season, during 2001-2010 than in 1961-1970, suggesting that human land use and management contribute to seasonal changes in the CO2 exchange between the biosphere and the atmosphere.","[Zeng, Ning; Zhao, Fang; Kalnay, Eugenia; Salawitch, Ross J.] Univ Maryland, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Zeng, Ning; Zhao, Fang; Kalnay, Eugenia; Salawitch, Ross J.] Univ Maryland, Earth Syst Sci Interdisciplinary Ctr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Collatz, George J.] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [West, Tristram O.] Pacific NW Natl Lab, Joint Global Change Res Inst, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Guanter, Luis] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Space Sci, D-12165 Berlin, Germany","Zeng, N (reprint author), Univ Maryland, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",zeng@atmos.umd.edu,"Salawitch, Ross/B-4605-2009; collatz, george/D-5381-2012; Zeng, Ning/A-3130-2008; Guanter, Luis/I-1588-2015","Salawitch, Ross/0000-0001-8597-5832; Zeng, Ning/0000-0002-7489-7629; Guanter, Luis/0000-0002-8389-5764; Kalnay, Eugenia/0000-0002-9984-9906","NOM [NA100AR4310248, NAO9NE54400006]; NSF [AGS-1129088]; NASA [NNH12AU351]","We thank all data providers, especially the NOAA CO<INF>2</INF> and Carbon Tracker team, and the Jena inversion team.

This increase has been linked to changes in temperate, boreal and arctic ecosystem properties and processes such as enhanced photosynthesis, increased heterotrophic respiration, and expansion of woody vegetation(4-6). However, the precise causal mechanisms behind the observed changes in atmospheric CO2 seasonality remain unclear(2-4). Here we use production statistics and a carbon accounting model to show that increases in agricultural productivity, which have been largely overlooked in previous investigations, explain as much as a quarter of the observed changes in atmospheric CO2 seasonality. Specifically, Northern Hemisphere extratropical maize, wheat, rice, and soybean production grew by 240 per cent between 1961 and 2008, thereby increasing the amount of net carbon uptake by croplands during the Northern Hemisphere growing season by 0.33 petagrams. Maize alone accounts for two-thirds of this change, owing mostly to agricultural intensification within concentrated production zones in the midwestern United States and northern China. Maize, wheat, rice, and soybeans account for about 68 per cent of extratropical dry biomass production, so it is likely that the total impact of increased agricultural production exceeds the amount quantified here.","[Gray, Josh M.; Friedl, Mark A.] Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Frolking, Steve] Univ New Hampshire, Earth Syst Res Ctr, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Kort, Eric A.] Univ Michigan, Dept Atmospher Ocean & Space Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Ray, Deepak K.] Univ Minnesota, Inst Environm, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Kucharik, Christopher J.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agron, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Kucharik, Christopher J.] Univ Wisconsin, Nelson Inst Ctr Sustainabil & Global Environm, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Ramankutty, Navin] McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ H3A 0B9, Canada","Gray, JM (reprint author), Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",joshgray@bu.edu,"Kort, Eric/F-9942-2012","Kort, Eric/0000-0003-4940-7541; Kucharik, Christopher/0000-0002-0400-758X; Ramankutty, Navin/0000-0002-3737-5717","CFCAS; NSERC; BIOCAP; Environment Canada; NRCan; CarboEuropelP; FAO-GTOS-TCO; iLEAPS; Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry; National Science Foundation; University of Tuscia; Universite Laval; US Department of Energy; NASA [NNX11AE75G]; NSF [EF-1064614, EAR-1038818]; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation; Institute on Environment at the University of Minnesota","This work used eddy covariance data acquired by the FLUXNET community and in particular by the following networks: AmeriFlux (US Department of Energy, Biological and Environmental Research, Terrestrial Carbon Program (DE-FG02-04ER63917 and DE-FG02-04ER63911)), AfriFlux, AsiaFlux, CarboAfrica, CarboEuropelP, Carboltaly, CarboMont, ChinaFlux, Fluxnet-Canada (supported by CFCAS, NSERC, BIOCAP, Environment Canada, and NRCan), GreenGrass, KoFlux, LBA, NECC, OzFlux, TCOS-Siberia, USCCC.

In mammals, replication timing is cell-type-specific with at least half the genome switching replication timing during development, primarily in units of 400-800 kilobases (replication domains'), whose positions are preserved in different cell types, conserved between species, and appear to confine long-range effects of chromosome rearrangements(2-7). Early and late replication correlate, respectively, with open and closed three-dimensional chromatin compartments identified by high-resolution chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C), and, to a lesser extent, late replication correlates with lamina-associated domains (LADs)(4,5,8,9). Recent Hi-C mapping has unveiled substructure within chromatin compartments called topologically associating domains (TADs) that are largely conserved in their positions between cell types and are similar in size to replication domains(8,10). However, TADs can be further sub-stratified into smaller domains, challenging the significance of structures at any particular scale(11,12). Moreover, attempts to reconcile TADs and LADs to replication-timing data have not revealed a common, underlying domain structure(8,9,13). Here we localize boundaries of replication domains to the early-replicating border of replication-timing transitions and map their positions in 18 human and 13 mouse cell types. We demonstrate that, collectively, replication domain boundaries share a near one-to-one correlation with TAD boundaries, whereas within a cell type, adjacent TADs that replicate at similar times obscure replication domain boundaries, largely accounting for the previously reported lack of alignment. Moreover, cell-type-specific replication timing of TADs partitions the genome into two large-scale sub-nuclear compartments revealing that replication-timing transitions are indistinguishable from late-replicating regions in chromatin composition and lamina association and accounting for the reduced correlation of replication timing to LADs and heterochromatin. Our results reconcile cell-type-specific sub-nuclear compartmentalization and replication timing with developmentally stable structural domains and offer a unified model for large-scale chromosome structure and function.","[Pope, Benjamin D.; Dileep, Vishnu; Vera, Daniel L.; Dennis, Jonathan H.; Gilbert, David M.] Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Ryba, Tyrone] New Coll Florida, Div Nat Sci, Sarasota, FL 34243 USA; [Yue, Feng] Penn State Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Hershey, PA 17033 USA; [Yue, Feng; Wang, Yanli; Snyder, Michael P.] Penn State Univ, Huck Inst Life Sci, Bioinformat & Genom Program, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Wu, Weisheng; Hardison, Ross C.] Penn State Univ, Huck Inst Life Sci, Ctr Comparat Genom & Bioinformat, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Denas, Olgert; Taylor, James] Emory Univ, O WayneRollins Res Ctr, Dept Biol, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Denas, Olgert; Taylor, James] Emory Univ, O WayneRollins Res Ctr, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Hansen, R.

This process is referred to in biogeography as vicariance(1). In the most species-rich region of the world, the Neotropics, the sundering of populations associated with the Andean uplift is ascribed this principal role in speciation(2-5). An alternative model posits that rather than being directly linked to landscape change, allopatric speciation is initiated to a greater extent by dispersal events, with the principal drivers of speciation being organism-specific abilities to persist and disperse in the landscape(6,7). Landscape change is not a necessity for speciation in this model(8). Here we show that spatial and temporal patterns of genetic differentiation in Neotropical birds are highly discordant across lineages and are not reconcilable with a model linking speciation solely to landscape change. Instead, the strongest predictors of speciation are the amount of time a lineage has persisted in the landscape and the ability of birds to move through the landscape matrix. These results, augmented by the observation that most species-level diversity originated after episodes of major Andean uplift in the Neogene period, suggest that dispersal and differentiation on a matrix previously shaped by large-scale landscape events was a major driver of avian speciation in lowland Neotropical rainforests.","[Smith, Brian Tilston; McCormack, John E.; Cuervo, Andres M.; Burney, Curtis W.; Harvey, Michael G.; Derryberry, Elizabeth P.; Prejean, Jesse; Fields, Samantha; Brumfield, Robb T.] Louisiana State Univ, Museum Nat Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Smith, Brian Tilston] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Dept Ornithol, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Cuervo, Andres M.; Burney, Curtis W.; Harvey, Michael G.; Prejean, Jesse; Fields, Samantha; Brumfield, Robb T.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Hickerson, Michael.

However, little is known about how migratory performance develops through life for any organism. To date, age variation has been almost systematically simplified into a dichotomous comparison between recently born juveniles at their first migration versus adults of unknown age(5-7). These comparisons have regularly highlighted better migratory performance by adults compared with juveniles', but it is unknown whether such variation is gradual or abrupt and whether it is driven by improvements within the individual, by selective mortality of poor performers, or both. Here we exploit the opportunity offered by long-term monitoring of individuals through Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite tracking to combine within-individual and cross-sectional data on 364 migration episodes from 92 individuals of a raptorial bird, aged 1-27 years old. We show that the development of migratory behaviour follows a consistent trajectory, more gradual and prolonged than previously appreciated, and that this is promoted by both individual improvements and selective mortality, mainly operating in early life and during the pre-breeding migration. Individuals of different age used different travelling tactics and varied in their ability to exploit tailwinds or to cope with wind drift. All individuals seemed aligned along a race with their contemporary peers, whose outcome was largely determined by the ability to depart early, affecting their subsequent recruitment, reproduction and survival. Understanding how climate change and human action can affect the migration of younger animals maybe the key to managing and forecasting the declines of many threatened migrants.","[Sergio, Fabrizio; Tanferna, Alessandro; De Stephanis, Renaud; Lopez Jimenez, Lidia; Blas, Julio; Hiraldo, Fernando] CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Dept Conservat Biol, Seville 41092, Spain; [Tavecchia, Giacomo] CSIC UIB, Inst Mediterranean Studies IMEDEA, Populat Ecol Grp, Esporles 07190, Spain; [Preatoni, Damiano] Insubria Univ, Dept Theoret & Appl Sci, I-21100 Varese, Italy","Sergio, F (reprint author), CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Dept Conservat Biol, Ave Amer Vespucio, Seville 41092, Spain.",fsergio@ebd.csic.es,"; Blas, Julio/A-2487-2012; Sergio, Fabrizio/B-3952-2015; Preatoni, Damiano/A-8621-2010; CSIC, EBD Donana/C-4157-2011; Tanferna, Alessandro/L-6648-2015","Tavecchia, Giacomo/0000-0001-5435-2691; Sergio, Fabrizio/0000-0002-8024-1773; Preatoni, Damiano/0000-0001-8760-1316; CSIC, EBD Donana/0000-0003-4318-6602; Tanferna, Alessandro/0000-0003-0799-301X","Natural Research Ltd; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation/Economy and Competitiveness [CGL2008-01781, CGL2011-28103, CGL2012-32544]; FEDER; Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Food and the Environment (Autonomous Organism of National Parks) [511/2012]; Consejeria de Medio Ambiente de la Junta de Andalucia [JA-58]; Junta de Andalucia [RNM 1790, RNM 3822, RNM 7307]; Juan de la Cierva Programme; Severo Ochoa Programme for Centres of Excellence of the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [SEV-2012-0262]; Ramon y Cajal contract from CSIC","We thank F.

Although this hypothesis has gained indirect support from human post-mortem brain analyses' and genetic studies(5-10), little is known about the pathophysiology of synapses in patient neurons and how susceptibility genes for mental disorders could lead to synaptic deficits in humans. Genetics of most psychiatric disorders are extremely complex due to multiple susceptibility variants with low penetrance and variable phenotypes(11). Rare, multiply affected, large families in which a single genetic locus is probably responsible for conferring susceptibility have proven invaluable for the study of complex disorders. Here we generated induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from four members of a family in which a frameshift mutation of disrupted in schizophrenia! (DISCI) co-segregated with major psychiatric disorders' and we further produced different isogenic iPS cell lines via gene editing. We showed that mutant DISCI causes synaptic vesicle release deficits in iPS-cell-derived forebrain neurons. Mutant DISCI depletes wild-type DISCI protein and, furthermore, dysregulates expression of many genes related to synapses and psychiatric disorders in human forebrain neurons. Our study reveals that a psychiatric disorder relevant mutation causes synapse deficits and transcriptional dysregulation in human neurons and our findings provide new insight into the molecular and synaptic etiopathology of psychiatric disorders.","[Wen, Zhexing; Ha Nam Nguyen; Wang, Xinyuan; Su, Yijing; Kim, Nam-Shik; Yoon, Ki-Jun; Shin, Jaehoon; Zhang, Ce; Makri, Georgia; Nauen, David; Yu, Huimei; Chiang, Cheng-Hsuan; Zou, Jizhong; Christian, Kimberly M.; Cheng, Linzhao; Song, Hongjun; Ming, Guo-li] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Inst Cell Engn, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Wen, Zhexing; Su, Yijing; Kim, Nam-Shik; Yoon, Ki-Jun; Zhang, Ce; Makri, Georgia; Yu, Huimei; Chiang, Cheng-Hsuan; Christian, Kimberly M.; Song, Hongjun; Ming, Guo-li] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Ha Nam Nguyen; Shin, Jaehoon; Ross, Christopher A.; Margolis, Russell L.; Song, Hongjun; Ming, Guo-li] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Grad Program Cellular & Mol Med, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Guo, Ziyuan; Chen, Gong] Penn State Univ, Huck Inst Life Sci, Dept Biol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Lalli, Matthew A.; Guzman, Elmer; Kosik, Kenneth S.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Biomol Sci & Engn Program, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, Neurosci Res Inst, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Wang, Xinyuan] Fudan Univ, Sch Basic Med Sci, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China; [Nauen, David] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Chiang, Cheng-Hsuan; Ross, Christopher A.; Margolis, Russell L.; Song, Hongjun; Ming, Guo-li] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Solomon Snyder Dept Neurosci, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Yoritomo, Nadine; Ross, Christopher A.; Margolis, Russell L.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Kaibuchi, Kozo] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Med, Showa Ku, Dept Cell Pharmacol, Nagoya, Aichi 4668550, Japan; [Zou, Jizhong; Cheng, Linzhao] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Ming, GL (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Inst Cell Engn, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",gming1@jhmi.edu,"Kaibuchi, Kozo/M-4887-2014","Kaibuchi, Kozo/0000-0003-0714-1992; Lalli, Matthew/0000-0003-0419-1206; nauen, david/0000-0002-2652-9944","NIH [MH087874, N5047344, NS048271, AG045656, MH102978]; IMHRO; SFARI; NARSAD; MSCRF; Dr. Miriam and Sheldon G.

The mammalian circadian clock consists of a central clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus that has tightly coupled neurons and synchronizes other clocks in peripheral tissues(1,2). Plants also have a circadian clock, but plant circadian clock function has long been assumed to be uncoupled(3). Only a few studies have been able to show weak, local coupling among cells'. Here, by implementing two novel techniques, we have performed a comprehensive tissue-specific analysis of leaf tissues, and show that the vasculature and mesophyll clocks asymmetrically regulate each other in Arabidopsis. The circadian clock in the vasculature has characteristics distinct from other tissues, cycles robustly without environmental cues, and affects circadian clock regulation in other tissues. Furthermore, we found that vasculature-enriched genes that are rhythmically expressed are preferentially expressed in the evening, whereas rhythmic mesophyll-enriched genes tend to be expressed in the morning. Our results set the stage for a deeper understanding of how the vasculature circadian clock in plants regulates key physiological responses such as flowering time.","[Endo, Motomu; Shimizu, Hanako; Araki, Takashi] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Biostudies, Div Integrated Life Sci, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Endo, Motomu] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, PRESTO, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; [Nohales, Maria A.; Kay, Steve A.] Univ So Calif Mol & Computat Biol, Dept Biol, Dana & David Dornsife Coll Letters Arts & Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA","Endo, M (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Biostudies, Div Integrated Life Sci, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.",moendo@lif.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Araki, Takashi/G-1760-2013","Araki, Takashi/0000-0002-3616-1493","HFSP long-term Fellowship [LT00017/2008-L]; JST PRESTO [11103346]; JSPS KAKENHI [22770036, 25650097]; Sumitomo Foundation; Nakatani Foundation; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R01 GM056006, GM067837];  [19060012];  [19060016]","We thank H.

The acute, voluminous diarrhoea caused by Vibrio cholerae represents a dramatic example of enteropathogen invasion and gut microbial community disruption. Here we conduct a detailed time-series metagenomic study of faecal microbiota collected during the acute diarrhoeal and recovery phases of cholera in a cohort of Bangladeshi adults living in an area with a high burden of disease(2). We find that recovery is characterized by a pattern of accumulation of bacterial taxa that shows similarities to the pattern of assembly/maturation of the gut microbiota in healthy Bangladeshi children(3). To define the underlying mechanisms, we introduce into gnotobiotic mice an artificial community composed of human gut bacterial species that directly correlate with recovery from cholera in adults and are indicative of normal microbiota maturation in healthy Bangladeshi children(3). One of the species, Ruminococcus obe urn, exhibits consistent increases in its relative abundance upon V. choleraeinfection of the mice. Follow-up analyses, including mono-and co-colonization studies, establish that R. obeum restricts V. cholerae colonization, that R. obewn luxS (autoinducer-2 (AI-2) synthase) expression and AI-2 production increase significantly with V. cholerae invasion, and that R. obeum AI-2 causes quorum-sensing-mediated repression of several V. cholerae colonization factors. Co-colonization with V. choleraemutants discloses that R. obeum AI-2 reduces Vibrio colonization/pathogenicity through a novel pathway that does not depend on the V. cholerae AI-2 sensor, LuxP. The approach described can be used to mine the gut microbiota of Bangladeshi or other populations for members that use autoinducers and/or other mechanisms to limit colonization with V. cholerae, or conceivably other enteropathogens.","[Hsiao, Ansel; Subramanian, Sathish; Griffin, Nicholas W.; Drewry, Lisa L.; Gordon, Jeffrey I.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Genome Sci & Syst Biol, St Louis, MO 63108 USA; [Ahmed, A.

The stages of erythrocyte invasion, including initial contact, apical reorientation, junction formation, and active invagination, are directed by coordinated release of specialized apical organelles and their parasite protein contents'. Among these proteins, and central to invasion by all species, are two parasite protein families, the reticulocyte-binding protein homologue (RH) and erythrocyte-binding like proteins, which mediate host-parasite interactions(2). RH5 from Plasmodium falciparum (PfRH5) is the only member of either family demonstrated to be necessary for erythrocyte invasion in all tested strains, through its interaction with the erythrocyte surface protein basigin (also known as CD 147 and EMMPRIN)(3,4). Antibodies targeting PfRH5 or basigin efficiently block parasite invasion in vitro(4-9), making PfRH5 an excellent vaccine candidate. Here we present crystal structures of PfRH5 in complex with basigin and two distinct inhibitory antibodies. PfRH5 adopts a novel fold in which two three-helical bundles come together in a kite-like architecture, presenting binding sites for basigin and inhibitory antibodies at one tip. This provides the first structural insight into erythrocyte binding by the Plasmodium RH protein family and identifies novel inhibitory epitopes to guide design of a new generation of vaccines against the blood-stage parasite.","[Wright, Katherine E.; Bartlett, Jonathan; Higgins, Matthew K.] Univ Oxford, Dept Biochem, Oxford OX1 3QU, England; [Hjerrild, Kathryn A.; Douglas, Alexander D.; Jin, Jing; Brown, Rebecca E.; Illingworth, Joseph J.; Ashfield, Rebecca; Draper, Simon J.] Univ Oxford, Jenner Inst, Oxford OX3 7DQ, England; [Clemmensen, Stine B.; de Jongh, Willem A.] ExpreS2 Biotechnol, DK-2970 Horsholm, Denmark","Higgins, MK (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Dept Biochem, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QU, England.",simon.draper@ndm.ox.ac.uk; matthew.higgins@bioch.ox.ac.uk,"Draper, Simon/F-1758-2011; Douglas, Alexander/E-7040-2012","Draper, Simon/0000-0002-9415-1357; Douglas, Alexander/0000-0002-5410-7562; Higgins, Matthew/0000-0002-2870-1955",UK Medical Research Council (MRC) [G1000527]; European Vaccine Initiative(EVI)(InnoMalVac); UK MRC [MR/K025554/1]; European Community [242095 EVIMalaR]; Wellcome Trust [089455/2/09/z],"M.K.H. is a Wellcome Trust Investigator (101020/Z/13/Z).

While reperfusion of ischaemic tissue is essential for survival, it also initiates oxidative damage, cell death and aberrant immune responses through the generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS)(1-5). Although mitochondrial ROS production in ischaemia reperfusion is established, it has generally been considered a nonspecific response to reperfusion(1,3). Here we develop a comparative in vivo metabolomic analysis, and unexpectedly identify widely conserved metabolic pathways responsible for mitochondrial ROS production during ischaemia reperfusion. We show that selective accumulation of the citric acid cycle intermediate succinate is a universal metabolic signature of ischaemia in a range of tissues and is responsible for mitochondrial ROS production during reperfusion. Ischaemic succinate accumulation arises from reversal of succinate dehydrogenase, which in turn is driven by fumarate overflow from purine nucleotide breakdown and partial reversal of the malate/aspartate shuttle. After reperfusion, the accumulated succinate is rapidly re-oxidized by succinate dehydrogenase, driving extensive ROS generation by reverse electron transport at mitochondrial complex I. Decreasing ischaemic succinate accumulation by pharmacological inhibition is sufficient to ameliorate in vivo ischaemia-reperfusion injury in murine models of heart attack and stroke. Thus, we have identified a conserved metabolic response of tissues to ischaemia and reperfusion that unifies many hitherto unconnected aspects of ischaemia-reperfusion injury. Furthermore, these findings reveal a new pathway for metabolic control of ROS production in vivo, while demonstrating that inhibition of ischaemic succinate accumulation and its oxidation after subsequent reperfusion is a potential therapeutic target to decrease ischaemia-reperfusion injury in a range of pathologies.","[Chouchani, Edward T.; Robb, Ellen L.; Logan, Angela; Smith, Anthony C.; Eyassu, Filmon; Dare, Anna J.; James, Andrew M.; Rogatti, Sebastian; Robinson, Alan J.; Murphy, Michael P.] MRC Mitochondrial Biol Unit, Cambridge CB2 0XY, England; [Chouchani, Edward T.; Pell, Victoria R.; Hu, Chou-Hui; Krieg, Thomas] Univ Cambridge, Addenbrookes Hosp, Dept Med, Cambridge CB2 0QQ, England; [Gaude, Edoardo; Costa, Ana S.

Generally, homologous recombination involves the exchange of genetic information between two identical or nearly identical DNA molecules(1); however, homologous recombination can also occur between RNA molecules, as shown for RNA viruses(2). Previous research showed that synthetic RNA oligonudeotides can act as templates for DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair in yeast and human cells(3,4), and artificial long RNA templates injected in ciliate cells can guide genomic rearrangements(5). Here we report that endogenous transcript RNA mediates homologous recombination with chromosomal DNA in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We developed a system to detect the events of homologous recombination initiated by transcript RNA following the repair of a chromosomal DSB occurring either in a homologous but remote locus, or in the same transcript-generating locus in reverse-transcription-defective yeast strains. We found that RNA-DNA recombination is blocked by ribonudeases H1 and H2. In the presence of H-type ribonudeases, DSB repair proceeds through a complementary DNA intermediate, whereas in their absence, it proceeds directly through RNA. The proximity of the transcript to its chromosomal DNA partner in the same locus facilitates Rad52-driven homologous recombination during DSB repair. We demonstrate that yeast and human Rad52 proteins efficiently catalyse annealing of RNA to a DSB-like DNA end in vitro. Our results reveal a novel mechanism of homologous recombination and DNA repair in which transcript RNA is used as a template for DSB repair. Thus, considering the abundance of RNA transcripts in cells, RNA may have a marked impact on genomic stability and plasticity.","[Keskin, Havva; Shen, Ying; Yang, Taehwan; Ashley, Katie; Storici, Francesca] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Huang, Fei; Patel, Mikir; Mazin, Alexander V.] Drexel Univ, Coll Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19102 USA","Storici, F (reprint author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",storici@gatech.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [MCB-1021763]; Georgia Research Alliance [R9028]; National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health [CA100839, P30CA056036]; Ministry of Science of Turkey","We thank D.

J,"Sczepanski, JT; Joyce, GF",,,,"Sczepanski, Jonathan T.; Joyce, Gerald F.",,,A cross-chiral RNA polymerase ribozyme,NATURE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,TEMPLATE; LIGATION; OLIGONUCLEOTIDES; POLYMERIZATION; EXTENSION; SELECTION; MODEL; ACID,"Thirty years ago it was shown that the non-enzymatic, template-directed polymerization of activated mononudeotides proceeds readily in a homochiral system, but is severely inhibited by the presence of the opposing enantiomerl. This finding poses a severe challenge for the spontaneous emergence of RNA-based life, and has led to the suggestion that either RNA was preceded by some other genetic polymer that is not subject to chiral inhibition(2) or chiral symmetry was broken through chemical processes before the origin of RNA-based life(3,4). Once an RNA enzyme arose that could catalyse the polymerization of RNA, it would have been possible to distinguish among the two enantiomers, enabling RNA replication and RNA-based evolution to occur. It is commonly thought that the earliest RNA polymerase and its substrates would have been of the same handedness, but this is not necessarily the case. Replicating D- and L-RNA molecules may have emerged together, based on the ability of structured RNAs of one handedness to catalyse the templated polymerization of activated mononudeotides of the opposite handedness. Here we develop such a cross-chiral RNA polymerase, using in vitro evolution starting from a population of random-sequence RNAs. The El-RNA enzyme, consisting of 83 nucleotides, catalyses the joining of L-mono- or oligonudeotide substrates on a complementary L-RNA template, and similar behaviour occurs for the L-enzyme with El-substrates and a El-template. Chiral inhibition is avoided because the 10(6)-fold rate acceleration of the enzyme only pertains to cross-chiral substrates. The enzyme's activity is sufficient to generate full-length copies of its enantiomer through the templated joining of 11 component oligonudeotides.","[Sczepanski, Jonathan T.; Joyce, Gerald F.] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Chem, Skaggs Inst Chem Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Joyce, GF (reprint author), Scripps Res Inst, Dept Chem, Skaggs Inst Chem Biol, 10550 North Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",gjoyce@scripps.edu,"Sczepanski, Jonathan/N-8719-2015","Sczepanski, Jonathan/0000-0002-9275-2597",NASA [NNX10AQ91G]; Simons Foundation [287624]; National Institutes of Health [F32 GM101741],This work was supported by grant NNX10AQ91G from NASA and by grant 287624 from the Simons Foundation.

Chemicals that block Ral function would be valuable as research tools and for cancer therapeutics. Here we used protein structure analysis and virtual screening to identify drug-like molecules that bind to a site on the GDP-bound form of Ral. The compounds RBC6, RBC8 and RBC10 inhibited the binding of Ral to its effector RALBP1, as well as inhibiting Ral-mediated cell spreading of murine embryonic fibroblasts and anchorage-independent growth of human cancer cell lines. The binding of the RBC8 derivative BQU57 to RalB was confirmed by isothermal titration calorimetry, surface plasmon resonance and H-1-N-15 transverse relaxation-optimized spectroscopy (TROSY) NMR spectroscopy. RBC8 and BQU57 show selectivity for Ral relative to the GTPases Ras and RhoA and inhibit tumour xenograft growth to a similar extent to the depletion of Ral using RNA interference. Our results show the utility of structure-based discovery for the development of therapeutics for Ral-dependent cancers.","[Yan, Chao; Guin, Sunny; Owens, Charles; Theodorescu, Dan] Univ Colorado, Dept Surg, Aurora, CO 80045 USA; [Liu, Degang; Li, Liwei; Khanna, May; Knabe, William E.; Meroueh, Samy O.] Indiana Univ Sch Med, Dept Biochem, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Wempe, Michael F.; Ross, David] Univ Colorado, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Aurora, CO 80045 USA; [Meier, Jeremy; Hoffman, Brenton; Schwartz, Martin A.] Univ Virginia, Cardiovasc Res Ctr, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Wysoczynski, Christina L.; Jones, David N.

SWEETs play crucial roles in cellular sugar efflux processes: that is, in phloem loading(4), pollen nutrition(5) and nectar secretion(6). Their bacterial homologues, which are called SemiSWEETs, are among the smallest known transporters(1,3). Here we show that SemiSWEET molecules, which consist of a triple-helix bundle, form symmetrical, parallel dimers, thereby generating the translocation pathway. Two SemiSWEET isoforms were crystallized, one in an apparently open state and one in an occluded state, indicating that SemiSWEETs and SWEETs are transporters that undergo rocking-type movements during the transport cycle. The topology of the triple-helix bundle is similar yet distinct to that of the basic building block of animal and plant major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporters (for example, GLUTs and SUTs). This finding indicates two possibilities: that SWEETs and MFS transporters evolved from an ancestral triple-helix bundle or that the triple-helix bundle represents convergent evolution. In SemiSWEETs and SWEETs, two triple-helix bundles are arranged in a parallel configuration to produce the 6-and 6+1-transmembranehelix pores, respectively. In the 12-transmembrane-helix MFS transporters, four triple-helix bundles are arranged into an alternating antiparallel configuration, resulting in a much larger 2 X 2 triplehelix bundle forming the pore. Given the similarity of SemiSWEETs and SWEETs to PQ-loop amino acid transporters and to mitochondrial pyruvate carriers (MPCs), the structures characterized here may also be relevant to other transporters in the MtN3 clan(7-9). The insight gained from the structures of these transporters and from the analysis of mutations of conserved residues will improve the understanding of the transport mechanism, as well as allow comparative studies of the different superfamilies involved in sugar transport and the evolution of transporters in general.","[Xu, Yan; Tao, Yuyong; Fan, Chao; Feng, Liang] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Physiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Cheung, Lily S.; Chen, Li-Qing; Frommer, Wolf B.] Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Plant Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Xu, Sophia; Frommer, Wolf B.] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Perry, Kay] Cornell Univ, Argonne Natl Lab, NE CAT, Argonne, IL 60439 USA; [Perry, Kay] Cornell Univ, Argonne Natl Lab, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Argonne, IL 60439 USA","Feng, L (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Physiol, 279 Campus Dr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",liangf@stanford.edu,"Frommer, Wolf/K-5042-2017","Frommer, Wolf/0000-0001-6465-0115; Cheung, Lily/0000-0001-8089-7783","Stanford University; Harold and Leila Y.

Using exome sequencing, here we show that analysis of rare coding variation in 3,871 autism cases and 9,937 ancestry-matched or parental controls implicates 22 autosomal genes at a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05, plus a set of 107 autosomal genes strongly enriched for those likely to affect risk (FDR < 0.30). These 107 genes, which show unusual evolutionary constraint against mutations, incur de novo loss-of-function mutations in over 5% of autistic subjects. Many of the genes implicated encode proteins for synaptic formation, transcriptional regulation and chromatin-remodelling pathways. These include voltage-gated ion channels regulating the propagation of action potentials, pacemaking and excitability-transcription coupling, as well as histone-modifying enzymes and chromatin remodellers-most prominently those that mediate post-translational lysine methylation/demethylation modifications of histones.","[De Rubeis, Silvia; Goldberg, Arthur P.; Poultney, Christopher S.; Kou, Yan; Fu, Shih-Chen; Brownfeld, Jessica M.; Cai, Jinlu; Kolevzon, Alexander; Reichenberg, Abraham; Buxbaum, Joseph D.] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Seaver Autism Ctr Res & Treatment, New York, NY 10029 USA; [De Rubeis, Silvia; Goldberg, Arthur P.; Poultney, Christopher S.; Kou, Yan; Fromer, Menachem; Fu, Shih-Chen; Brownfeld, Jessica M.; Cai, Jinlu; Kolevzon, Alexander; Purcell, Shaun; Reichenberg, Abraham; Skiar, Pamela; Buxbaum, Joseph D.] Mt Sinai Med Ctr, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10029 USA; [He, Xin; Cicek, A.

Here we apply it to more than 2,500 simplex families, each having a child with an autistic spectrum disorder. By comparing affected to unaffected siblings, we show that 13% of de novo missense mutations and 43% of de novo likely gene-disrupting (LGD) mutations contribute to 12% and 9% of diagnoses, respectively. Including copy number variants, coding de novo mutations contribute to about 30% of all simplex and 45% of female diagnoses. Almost all LGD mutations occur opposite wild-type alleles. LGD targets in affected females significantly overlap the targets in males of lower intelligence quotient (IQ), but neither overlaps significantly with targets in males of higher IQ. We estimate that LGD mutation in about 400 genes can contribute to the joint class of affected females and males of lower IQ, with an overlapping and similar number of genes vulnerable to contributory missense mutation. LGD targets in the joint class overlap with published targets for intellectual disability and schizophrenia, and are enriched for chromatin modifiers, FMRP-associated genes and embryonically expressed genes. Most of the significance for the latter comes from affected females.","[Iossifov, Ivan; Ronemus, Michael; Levy, Dan; Yamrom, Boris; Lee, Yoon-ha; Grabowska, Ewa; Dalkic, Ertugrul; Wang, Zihua; Marks, Steven; Andrews, Peter; Leotta, Anthony; Kendall, Jude; Hakker, Inessa; Rosenbaum, Julie; Ma, Beicong; Rodgers, Linda; Troge, Jennifer; Narzisi, Giuseppe; Yoon, Seungtai; Schatz, Michael C.; McCombie, W.

A 'domestic' form of the mosquito Aedes aegypti has evolved to specialize in biting humans and is the main worldwide vector of dengue, yellow fever, and chikungunya viruses. The domestic form coexists with an ancestral, 'forest' form that prefers to bite non-human animals and is found along the coast of Kenya. We collected the two forms, established laboratory colonies, and document striking divergence in preference for human versus non-human animal odour. We further show that the evolution of preference for human odour in domestic mosquitoes is tightly linked to increases in the expression and ligand-sensitivity of the odorant receptor AaegOr4, which we found recognizes a compound present at high levels inhuman odour. Our results provide a rare example of a gene contributing to behavioural evolution and provide insight into how disease-vectoring mosquitoes came to specialize on humans.","[McBride, Carolyn S.; Baier, Felix; Spitzer, Sarabeth A.; Vosshall, Leslie B.] Rockefeller Univ, Lab Neurogenet & Behav, New York, NY 10065 USA; [McBride, Carolyn S.; Vosshall, Leslie B.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Omondi, Aman B.; Ignell, Rickard] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Plant Protect Biol, Unit Chem Ecol, S-23053 Alnarp, Sweden; [Lutomiah, Joel; Sang, Rosemary] Kenya Govt Med Res Ctr, Ctr Virus Res, Nairobi, Kenya","Vosshall, LB (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Lab Neurogenet & Behav, New York, NY 10065 USA.",Leslie.Vosshall@rockefeller.edu,,"Baier, Felix/0000-0003-4056-1729",Foundation for the National Institutes of Health through the Grand Challenges in Global Health Initiative; National Institutes of Health grants: K99 award from NIDCD [DC012069]; NIAID Vectorbase DBP [HHSN272200900039C]; CTSA award from NCATS [5UL1TR000043]; Swedish Research Council and SLU: Insect Chemical Ecology and Evolution (IC-E3),"We thank M.

However, the fate of the large endocytic vesicles is not known. Here we demonstrate that these vesicles transition to a synaptic endosome about one second after stimulation. The endosome is resolved into coated vesicles after 3 s, which in turn become small-diameter synaptic vesicles 5-6 s after stimulation. We disrupted clathrin function using RNA interference (RNAi) and found that clathrin is not required for ultrafast endocytosis but is required to generate synaptic vesicles from the endosome. Ultrafast endocytosis fails when actin polymerization is disrupted, or when neurons are stimulated at room temperature instead of physiological temperature. In the absence of ultrafast endocytosis, synaptic vesicles are retrieved directly from the plasma membrane by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. These results may explain discrepancies among published experiments concerning the role of clathrin in synaptic vesicle endocytosis.","[Watanabe, Shigeki; Davis, M.

Complex structures observed in the ejecta at late stages(3-5) could result from interactions with the companion during the common-envelope phase(6,7). Alternatively, the explosion could be intrinsically bipolar, resulting from a localized ignition on the surface of the white dwarf(8) or as a consequence of rotational distortion(9,10). Studying the structure of novae during the earliest phases is challenging because of the high spatial resolution needed to measure their small sizes(11). Here we report near-infrared interferometric measurements of the angular size of Nova Delphini 2013, starting one day after the explosion and continuing with extensive time coverage during the first 43 days. Changes in the apparent expansion rate can be explained by an explosion model consisting of an optically thick core surrounded by a diffuse envelope. The optical depth of the ejected material changes as it expands. We detect an ellipticity in the light distribution, suggesting a prolate or bipolar structure that develops as early as the second day. Combining the angular expansion rate with radial velocity measurements, we derive a geometric distance to the nova of 4.54 +/- 60.59 kiloparsecs from the Sun.","[Schaefer, G.

It describes a mechanism through which a quantum Hall effect can appear as an intrinsic property of a band structure, rather than being caused by an external magnetic field(2). Although physical implementation has been considered unlikely, the Haldane model has provided the conceptual basis for theoretical and experimental research exploring topological insulators and superconductors(2-6). Here we report the experimental realization of the Haldane model and the characterization of its topological band structure, using ultracold fermionic atoms in a periodically modulated optical honeycomb lattice. The Haldane model is based on breaking both time-reversal symmetry and inversion symmetry. To break time-reversal symmetry, we introduce complex next-nearest-neighbour tunnelling terms, which we induce through circular modulation of the lattice position(7). To break inversion symmetry, we create an energy offset between neighbouring sites(8). Breaking either of these symmetries opens a gap in the band structure, which we probe using momentum-resolved interband transitions. We explore the resulting Berry curvatures, which characterize the topology of the lowest band, by applying a constant force to the atoms and find orthogonal drifts analogous to a Hall current. The competition between the two broken symmetries gives rise to a transition between topologically distinct regimes. By identifying the vanishing gap at a single Dirac point, we map out this transition line experimentally and quantitatively compare it to calculations using Floquet theory without free parameters. We verify that our approach, which allows us to tune the topological properties dynamically, is suitable even for interacting fermionic systems. Furthermore, we propose a direct extension to realize spin-dependent topological Hamiltonians.","[Jotzu, Gregor; Messer, Michael; Desbuquois, Remi; Lebrat, Martin; Uehlinger, Thomas; Greif, Daniel; Esslinger, Tilman] ETH, Inst Quantum Elect, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland","Esslinger, T (reprint author), ETH, Inst Quantum Elect, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",esslinger@phys.ethz.ch,"Esslinger, Tilman/M-9022-2016; Desbuquois, Remi/A-2256-2017; Greif, Daniel/M-4480-2017","Esslinger, Tilman/0000-0002-8333-107X; Desbuquois, Remi/0000-0003-3726-0538; Greif, Daniel/0000-0002-0721-7726; Jotzu, Gregor/0000-0003-4421-5874",SNF; NCCR-QSIT; SQMS (ERC advanced grant),"We thank H.

Notably, the discovery of topological phases in condensed-matter systems has changed the modern conception of phases of matter(1-5). The global nature of topological ordering, however, makes direct experimental probing an outstanding challenge. Present experimental tools are mainly indirect and, as a result, are inadequate for studying the topology of physical systems at a fundamental level. Here we employ the exquisite control afforded by state-of-the-art superconducting quantum circuits to investigate topological properties of various quantum systems. The essence of our approach is to infer geometric curvature by measuring the deflection of quantum trajectories in the curved space of the Hamiltonian(6). Topological properties are then revealed by integrating the curvature over closed surfaces, a quantum analogue of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. We benchmark our technique by investigating basic topological concepts of the historically important Haldane model(7) after mapping the momentum space of this condensed-matter model to the parameter space of a single-qubit Hamiltonian. In addition to constructing the topological phase diagram, we are able to visualize the microscopic spin texture of the associated states and their evolution across a topological phase transition. Going beyond non-interacting systems, we demonstrate the power of our method by studying topology in an interacting quantum system. This required anew qubit architecture(8,9) that allows for simultaneous control over every term in a two-qubit Hamiltonian. By exploring the parameter space of this Hamiltonian, we discover the emergence of an interaction-induced topological phase. Our work establishes a powerful, generalizable experimental platform to study topological phenomena in quantum systems.","[Roushan, P.; Neill, C.; Chen, Yu; Quintana, C.; Leung, N.; Fang, M.; Barends, R.; Campbell, B.; Chen, Z.; Chiaro, B.; Dunsworth, A.; Jeffrey, E.; Kelly, J.; Megrant, A.; Mutus, J.; O'Malley, P.

The gap opening temperature usually sets the superconducting transition temperature T-c, as the gap signals the formation of Cooper pairs, the bound electron states responsible for superconductivity. To understand why Cooper pairs form at such high temperatures, we examine the role of the SrTiO3 substrate. Here we report high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy results that reveal an unexpected characteristic of the single-unit-cell FeSe/SrTiO3 system: shake-off bands suggesting the presence of bosonic modes, most probably oxygen optical phonons in SrTiO3 (refs 5-7), which couple to the FeSe electrons with only a small momentum transfer. Such interfacial coupling assists superconductivity in most channels, including those mediated by spin fluctuations(8-14). Our calculations suggest that this coupling is responsible for raising the superconducting gap opening temperature in single-unit-cell FeSe/SrTiO3.","[Lee, J. J.; Schmitt, F. T.; Moore, R.

As the most recalcitrant of the three components of lignocellulosic biomass (cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin)(3), lignin has been treated as a waste product in the pulp and paper industry, where it is burned to supply energy and recover pulping chemicals in the operation of paper mills(4). Extraction of higher value from lignin is increasingly recognized as being crucial to the economic viability of integrated biorefineries(5,6). Depolymerization is an important starting point for many lignin valorization strategies, because it could generate valuable aromatic chemicals and/or provide a source of low-molecular-mass feedstocks suitable for downstream processing(7). Commercial precedents show that certain types of lignin(lignosulphonates) may be converted into vanillin and other marketable products(8,9), but new technologies are needed to enhance the lignin value chain. The complex, irregular structure of lignin complicates chemical conversion efforts, and known depolymerization methods typically afford ill-defined products in low yields (that is, less than 10-20wt%)(2,10,11). Here we describe a method for the depolymerization of oxidized lignin under mild conditions in aqueous formic acid that results in more than 60wt% yield of low-molecular-mass aromatics. We present the discovery of this facile C-O cleavage method, its application to aspen lignin depolymerization, and mechanistic insights into the reaction.

Delamination and convective downwelling are two widely recognized processes invoked to explain the removal of lithospheric mantle under or adjacent to orogenic belts(2-5). Here we relate oceanic plate subduction to removal of adjacent continental lithosphere in certain plate tectonic settings. We have developed teleseismic body wave images from dense broadband seismic experiments that show higher than expected volumes of anomalously fast mantle associated with the subducted Atlantic slab under northeastern South America and the Alboran slab beneath the Gibraltar arc region(6,7); the anomalies are under, and are aligned with, the continental margins at depths greater than 200 kilometres. Rayleigh wave analysis(8,9) finds that the lithospheric mantle under the continental margins is significantly thinner than expected, and that thin lithosphere extends from the orogens adjacent to the subduction zones inland to the edges of nearby cratonic cores. Taking these data together, here we describe a process that can lead to the loss of continental lithosphere adjacent to a subduction zone. Subducting oceanic plates can viscously entrain and remove the bottom of the continental thermal boundary layer lithosphere from adjacent continental margins. This drives surface tectonics and pre-conditions the margins for further deformation by creating topography along the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary. This can lead to development of secondary downwellings under the continental interior, probably under both South America and the Gibraltar arc(8,10), and to delamination of the entire lithospheric mantle, as around the Gibraltar arc(11). This process reconciles numerous, sometimes mutually exclusive, geodynamic models proposed to explain the complex oceanic-continental tectonics of these subduction zones(12-17).","[Levander, A.; Niu, F.; Palomeras, I.; Thurner, S.

Because the holotype consists mostly of giant forelimbs (2.4 min length) with scapulocoracoids(2), for almost 50 years Deinocheirus has remained one of the most mysterious dinosaurs. The mosaic of ornithomimosaur and nonornithomimosaur characters in the holotype has made it difficult to resolve the phylogenetic status of Deinocheirus(3,4). Here we describe two new specimens of Deinocheirus that were discovered in the Nemegt Formation of Altan Uul IV in 2006 and Bugiin Tsav in 2009. The Bugiin Tsav specimen (MPC-D100/127) includes a left forelimb clearly identifiable as Deinocheirus and is 6% longer than the holotype. The Altan Uul IV specimen(MPC-D100/128) is approximately 74% the size of MPC-D 100/127. Cladistic analysis indicates that Deinocheirus is the largest member of the Ornithomimosauria; however, it has many unique skeletal features unknown in other ornithomimosaurs, indicating that Deinocheirus was a heavily built, non-cursorial animal with an elongate snout, a deep jaw, tall neural spines, a pygostyle, a U-shaped furcula, an expanded pelvis for strong muscle attachments, a relatively short hind limb and broad-tipped pedal unguals. Ecomorphological features in the skull, more than a thousand gastroliths, and stomach contents (fish remains) suggest that Deinocheirus was a megaomnivore that lived in mesic environments.","[Lee, Yuong-Nam; Lee, Hang-Jae] Korea Inst Geosci & Mineral Resources, Geol Museum, Taejon 305350, South Korea; [Barsbold, Rinchen; Chinzorig, Tsogtbaatar] Mongolian Acad Sci, Paleontol Ctr, Ulaanbaatar 210351, Mongol Peo Rep; [Currie, Philip J.] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada; [Kobayashi, Yoshitsugu] Hokkaido Univ, Hokkaido Univ Museum, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan; [Godefroit, Pascal] Royal Belgian Inst Nat Sci, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [Escuillie, Francois] Eldonia, F-3800 Gannat, France","Lee, YN (reprint author), Korea Inst Geosci & Mineral Resources, Geol Museum, Taejon 305350, South Korea.",ylee@kigam.re.kr,"Currie, Philip/A-2628-2014","Currie, Philip/0000-0001-6857-3161","Hwaseong City, Gyeonggi Province, South Korea; Korea Institute of Geosciences and Mineral Resources, Korea; Paleontological Center of Mongolian Academy of Sciences, Mongolia","Information gained from Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska and Wojtec Skarzynski (who respectively found and excavated the holotype) allowed us to refind the original quarry at Altan Uul III.

This pivotal concept of population genetics has implications for species health, domestication, management and conservation. Levels of genetic diversity seem to vary greatly in natural populations and species, but the determinants of this variation, and particularly the relative influences of species biology and ecology versus population history, are still largely mysterious(1,2). Here we show that the diversity of a species is predictable, and is determined in the first place by its ecological strategy. We investigated the genome-wide diversity of 76 non-model animal species by sequencing the transcriptome of two to ten individuals in each species. The distribution of genetic diversity between species revealed no detectable influence of geographic range or invasive status but was accurately predicted by key species traits related to parental investment: long-lived or low-fecundity species with brooding ability were genetically less diverse than short-lived or highly fecund ones. Our analysis demonstrates the influence of long-term life-history strategies on species response to short-term environmental perturbations, a result with immediate implications for conservation policies.","[Romiguier, J.; Gayral, P.; Ballenghien, M.; Bernard, A.; Cahais, V.; Dernat, R.; Faivre, N.; Loire, E.; Lourenco, J.

This expansion has been attributed to the increased proliferative potential(1,2) of radial glia (RG; neural stem cells) and their subventricular dispersion from the periventricular niche(3-5) during neocortical development. Such adaptations may have evolved through gene expression changes in RG. However, whether or how RG gene expression varies between humans and other species is unknown. Here we show that the transcriptional profiles of human and mouse neocortical RG are broadly conserved during neurogenesis, yet diverge for specific signalling pathways. By analysing differential gene co-expression relationships between the species, we demonstrate that the growth factor PDGFD is specifically expressed by RG inhuman, but not mouse, corticogenesis. We also show that the expression domain of PDGFR beta, the cognate receptor(6,7) for PDGFD, is evolutionarily divergent, with high expression in the germinal region of dorsal human neocortex but not in the mouse. Pharmacological inhibition of PDGFD-PDGFR beta signalling in slice culture prevents normal cell cycle progression of neocortical RG in human, but not mouse. Conversely, injection of recombinant PDGFD or ectopic expression of constitutively active PDGFR beta in developing mouse neocortex increases the proportion of RG and their subventricular dispersion. These findings highlight the requirement of PDGFD-PDGFR beta signalling for human neocortical development and suggest that local production of growth factors by RG supports the expanded germinal region and progenitor heterogeneity of species with large brains.","[Lui, Jan H.; Nowakowski, Tomasz J.; Pollen, Alex A.; Javaherian, Ashkan; Kriegstein, Arnold R.; Oldham, Michael C.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Neurol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Lui, Jan H.; Nowakowski, Tomasz J.; Pollen, Alex A.; Javaherian, Ashkan; Kriegstein, Arnold R.; Oldham, Michael C.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Eli & Edythe Broad Ctr Regenerat Med & Stem Cell, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Oldham, MC (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Neurol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",kriegsteina@stemcell.ucsf.edu; oldhamm@stemcell.ucsf.edu,"Nowakowski, Tomasz/P-7731-2014","Nowakowski, Tomasz/0000-0003-2345-4964","NIH, NINDS; Bernard Osher Foundation, a California Institute for Regenerative Medicine Predoctoral Fellowship [TG2-01153]; Damon Runyon Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowship [DRG-2013]; University of California San Francisco Program for Breakthrough Biomedical Research - Sandler Foundation","We thank the staff at San Francisco General Hospital Women's Options Center for their consideration in allowing access to donated human prenatal tissue.

The neural circuits that convey olfactory information from the sense organ to the cortical and subcortical olfactory centres have been anatomically defined(1-3), but the specific pathways responsible for innate responses to volatile odours have not been identified. Here we devise genetic strategies that demonstrate that a stereotyped neural circuit that transmits information from the olfactory bulb to cortical amygdala is necessary for innate aversive and appetitive behaviours. Moreover, we use the promoter of the activity-dependent gene arcto express the photosensitive ion channel, channelrhodopsin, in neurons of the cortical amygdala activated by odours that elicit innate behaviours. Optical activation of these neurons leads to appropriate behaviours that recapitulate the responses to innate odours. These data indicate that the cortical amygdala plays a critical role in generating innate odour-driven behaviours but do not preclude its participation in learned olfactory behaviours.","[Root, Cory M.; Axel, Richard] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Neurosci, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Root, Cory M.; Axel, Richard] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Denny, Christine A.] New York State Psychiat Inst & Hosp, Dept Biol Sci, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Denny, Christine A.; Hen, Rene] New York State Psychiat Inst & Hosp, Dept Neurosci & Psychiat, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Denny, Christine A.; Hen, Rene] New York State Psychiat Inst & Hosp, Div Integrat Neurosci, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Hen, Rene] Columbia Univ, New York State Psychiat Inst, Dept Pharmacol, New York, NY 10032 USA","Axel, R (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Neurosci, New York, NY 10032 USA.",ra27@columbia.edu,"Denny, Christine Ann/I-5235-2015","Denny, Christine Ann/0000-0002-6926-2020",Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Mathers Foundation,"We thank L.

The amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease posits that the excessive accumulation of amyloid-beta peptide leads to neurofibrillary tangles composed of aggregated hyperphosphorylated tau(2,3). However, to date, no single disease model has serially linked these two pathological events using human neuronal cells. Mouse models with familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mutations exhibit amyloid-beta-induced synaptic and memory deficits but they do not fully recapitulate other key pathological events of Alzheimer's disease, including distinct neurofibrillary tangle pathology(4,5). Human neurons derived from Alzheimer's disease patients have shown elevated levels of toxic amyloid-beta species and phosphorylated tau but did not demonstrate amyloid-beta plaquesor neurofibrillary tangles(6-11). Here we report that FAD mutations in beta-amyloid precursor protein and presenilin 1 are able to induce robust extracellular deposition of amyloid-beta, including amyloid-beta plaques, in a human neural stem-cell-derived three-dimensional (3D) culture system. More importantly, the 3D-differentiated neuronal cells expressing FAD mutations exhibited high levels of detergent-resistant, silver-positive aggregates of phosphorylated tau in the soma and neurites, as well as filamentous tau, as detected by immunoelectron microscopy. Inhibition of amyloidb beta generation with beta- or gamma-secretase inhibitors not only decreased amyloid-beta pathology, but also attenuated tauopathy. We also found that glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) regulated amyloid-beta-mediated tau phosphorylation. We have successfully recapitulated amyloid-beta and tau pathology in a single 3D human neural cell culture system. Our unique strategy for recapitulating Alzheimer's disease pathology in a 3D neural cell culture model should also serve to facilitate the development of more precise human neural cell models of other neurodegenerative disorders.","[Choi, Se Hoon; Kim, Young Hye; Hebisch, Matthias; Sliwinski, Christopher; D'Avanzo, Carla; Chen, Hechao; Hooli, Basavaraj; Asselin, Caroline; Klee, Justin B.; Zhang, Can; Kovacs, Dora M.; Tanzi, Rudolph E.; Kim, Doo Yeon] Harvard Univ, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, MassGeneral Inst Neurodegenerat Dis, Genet & Aging Res Unit,Med Sch, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Kim, Young Hye] Korea Basic Sci Inst, Div Mass Spectrometry Res, Cheongju 363883, Chungbuk, South Korea; [Hebisch, Matthias; Peitz, Michael] Univ Bonn, Life & Brain Ctr, Inst Reconstruct Neurobiol, D-53127 Bonn, Germany; [Hebisch, Matthias; Peitz, Michael] Hertie Fdn, D-53127 Bonn, Germany; [Lee, Seungkyu; Wainger, Brian J.; Woolf, Clifford J.] Boston Childrens Hosp, FM Kirby Neurobiol Ctr, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Lee, Seungkyu; Wainger, Brian J.; Woolf, Clifford J.] Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Muffat, Julien] Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Wagner, Steven L.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Neurosci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Kim, DY (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, MassGeneral Inst Neurodegenerat Dis, Genet & Aging Res Unit,Med Sch, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA.",tanzi@helix.mgh.harvard.edu; dkim@helix.mgh.harvard.edu,"Wainger, Brian/L-7553-2017","Muffat, Julien/0000-0003-1889-7023","Cure Alzheimer's fund; national Institute of Health grants [5P01AG15379, 5R37MH060009]; NIH/NINDS [P30NS04776]; IBDG Grant [DK43351]; BADERC Award [DK57521]","This work was supported by the grants from the Cure Alzheimer's fund (D.Y.K., S.H.C. and R.E.T.) and national Institute of Health grants 5P01AG15379 (R.E.T.) and 5R37MH060009 (R.E.T.).

Studies of sensory neurons have suggested Piezo proteins as subunits of Ca2+-permeable non-selective cationic channels for detection of noxious mechanical impact(6-8). Here we show Piezol (Fam38a) channels as sensors of frictional force (shear stress) and determinants of vascular structure in both development and adult physiology. Global or endothelial-specific disruption of mouse Piezol profoundly disturbed the developing vasculature and was embryonic lethal within days of the heart beating. Haploinsufficiency was not lethal but endothelial abnormality was detected in mature vessels. The importance of Piezol channels as sensors of blood flow was shown by Piezol dependence of shear-stress-evoked ionic current and calcium influx in endothelial cells and the ability of exogenous Piezol to confer sensitivity to shear stress on otherwise resistant cells. Down-stream of this calcium influx there was protease activation and spatial reorganization of endothelial cells to the polarity of the applied force. The data suggest that Piezol channels function as pivotal integrators in vascular biology.,"[Li, Jing; Hou, Bing; Tumova, Sarka; Bruns, Alexander; Ludlow, Melanie J.; Sedo, Alicia; Hyman, Adam J.; McKeown, Lynn; Young, Richard S.; Yuldasheva, Nadira Y.; Majeed, Yasser; Wilson, Lesley A.; Rode, Baptiste; Bailey, Marc A.; Fu, Zhaojun; Carter, Deborah A.

Mammalian mitoribosomes, which comprise 39S and 28S subunits(2), have diverged markedly from the bacterial ribosomes from which they are derived, rendering them unique compared to bacterial, eukaryotic cytosolic and fungal mitochondrial ribosomes(3-5). We have previously determined at 4.9 angstrom resolution the architecture of the porcine (Sus scrofa) 39S subunit(6), which is highly homologous to the human mitoribosomal large subunit. Here we present the complete atomic structure of the porcine 39S large mitoribosomal subunit determined in the context of a stalled translating mitoribosome at 3.4 angstrom resolution by cryo-electron microscopy and chemical crosslinking/mass spectrometry. The structure reveals the locations and the detailed folds of 50 mitoribosomal proteins, shows the highly conserved mitoribosomal peptidyl transferase active site in complex with its substrate transfer RNAs, and defines the path of the nascent chain in mammalian mitoribosomes along their idiosyncratic exit tunnel. Furthermore, we present evidence that a mitochondrial tRNA has become an integral component of the central protuberance of the 39S subunit where it architecturally substitutes for the absence of the 5S ribosomal RNA, a ubiquitous component of all cytoplasmic ribosomes.","[Greber, Basil J.; Boehringer, Daniel; Leibundgut, Marc; Bieri, Philipp; Schmitz, Nikolaus; Ban, Nenad] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Mol Biol & Biophys, Dept Biol, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Leitner, Alexander; Aebersold, Ruedi] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Mol Syst Biol, Dept Biol, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Aebersold, Ruedi] Univ Zurich, Fac Sci, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland","Ban, N (reprint author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Mol Biol & Biophys, Dept Biol, Otto Stern Weg 5, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",ban@mol.biol.ethz.ch,,"Greber, Basil/0000-0001-9379-7159","Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF); National Center of Excellence in Research (NCCR) Structural Biology program of the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF); European Research Council (ERC) under the European Community [250071]; Commission of the European Communities through the PROSPECTS consortium (EU FP7 projects) [201648, 233226]; European Research Council [ERC-2008-AdG 233226]","Cryo-EM data were collected at the electron microscopy facility of ETH Zurich (ScopeM).

In the fruit-fly Drosophila melanogaster, the dosage-compensation complex promotes two fold hypertranscription of the singlemale X-chromosome and is silenced in females by inhibition of the translation of msl2, which codes for the limiting component of the dosage-compensation complex(1,2). The female-specific protein Sex-lethal (Sxl) recruits Upstream of-N-ras(Unr) to the 39 untranslated region of msl2 messenger RNA, preventing the engagement of the small ribosomal subunit(3). Here we report the 2.8 angstrom crystal structure, NMR and small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering data of the ternary Sxl-Unr-msl2 ribonucleoprotein complex featuring unprecedented intertwined interactions of two Sxl RNA recognition motifs, a Unr cold-shock domain and RNA. Cooperative complex formation is associated with a 1,000-fold increase of RNA binding affinity for the Unr cold-shock domain and involves novel ternary interactions, as well as non-canonical RNA contacts by the alpha 1 helix of Sxl RNA recognition motif 1. Our results suggest that repression of dosage compensation, necessary for female viability, is triggered by specific, cooperative molecular interactions that lock a ribonucleoprotein switch to regulate translation. The structure serves as a paradigm for how a combination of general and widespread RNA binding domains expands the code for specific single-stranded RNA recognition in the regulation of gene expression.","[Hennig, Janosch; Popowicz, Grzegorz M.; Wang, Iren; Sonntag, Miriam; Geerlof, Arie; Sattler, Michael] Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Inst Struct Biol, DE-85764 Munich, Germany; [Hennig, Janosch; Popowicz, Grzegorz M.; Wang, Iren; Sonntag, Miriam; Sattler, Michael] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Chem, Ctr Integrated Prot Sci Munich Biomol NMR Spect, DE-85747 Garching, Germany; [Militti, Cristina; Gebauer, Fatima] Ctr Genom Regulat, Gene Regulat Stem Cells & Canc Programme, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Militti, Cristina; Gebauer, Fatima] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Gabel, Frank] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Inst Biol Struct, F-38044 Grenoble, France; [Gabel, Frank] CNRS, Inst Biol Struct, F-38044 Grenoble, France; [Gabel, Frank] Commissariat Energie Atom & Energies Alternat, Inst Biol Struct, F-38044 Grenoble, France; [Gabel, Frank] Inst Max Von Laue Paul Langevin, F-38042 Grenoble, France","Sattler, M (reprint author), Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Inst Struct Biol, Ingolstadter Landstr 1, DE-85764 Munich, Germany.",fatima.gebauer@crg.eu; sattler@helmholtz-muenchen.de,"Gebauer, Fatima/E-7725-2015; Popowicz, Grzegorz/G-4769-2017; Sattler, Michael/A-2407-2012","Gebauer, Fatima/0000-0001-7563-0013; Popowicz, Grzegorz/0000-0003-2818-7498; Sattler, Michael/0000-0002-1594-0527","Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsradet); European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) [ALTF276-2010]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [BFU2009-08243, Consolider CSD2009-00080]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB1035, GRK1721]","We thank H.-S.

Here we report a paradoxical effect of CCL2 in four syngeneic mouse models of metastatic breast cancer. Surprisingly, interruption of CCL2 inhibition leads to an overshoot of metastases and accelerates death. This is the result of monocyte release from the bone marrow and enhancement of cancer cell mobilization from the primary tumour, as well as blood vessel formation and increased proliferation of metastatic cells in the lungs in an interleukin (IL)-6- and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A-dependent manner. Notably, inhibition of CCL2 and IL-6 markedly reduced metastases and increased survival of the animals. CCL2 has been implicated in various neoplasias and adopted as a therapeutic target(1-3). However, our results call for caution when considering anti-CCL2 agents as monotherapy in metastatic disease and highlight the tumour microenvironment as a critical determinant of successful anti-metastatic therapy.","[Bonapace, Laura; Coissieux, Marie-May; Wyckoff, Jeffrey; Bentires-Alj, Mohamed] Friedrich Miescher Inst Biomed Res FMI, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland; [Bonapace, Laura; Junt, Tobias] Novartis Inst Biomed Res, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland; [Mertz, Kirsten D.; Varga, Zsuzsanna] Univ Zurich Hosp, Dept Pathol, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; [Mertz, Kirsten D.] Cantonal Hosp Baselland, Inst Pathol Liestal, CH-4410 Liestal, Switzerland","Bonapace, L (reprint author), Friedrich Miescher Inst Biomed Res FMI, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland.",bentires@fmi.ch,"Mohamed, Bentires-Alj/F-4484-2015","Mohamed, Bentires-Alj/0000-0001-6344-1127",Novartis Research Foundation; European Research Council [243211-PTPsBDC]; Swiss Cancer League; Swiss National Foundation; Krebsliga Beider Basel; FP7 Marie Curie Fellowship,"We thank R.

One idea posits cheats as a primitive germ line in a life cycle that facilitates collective reproduction. Here we describe an experiment in which simple cooperating lineages of bacteria were propagated under a selective regime that rewarded collective-level persistence. Collectives reproduced via life cycles that either embraced, or purged, cheating types. When embraced, the life cycle alternated between phenotypic states. Selection fostered inception of a developmental switch that underpinned the emergence of collectives whose fitness, during the course of evolution, became decoupled from the fitness of constituent cells. Such development and decoupling did not occur when groups reproduced via a cheat-purging regime.

It couples electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone with proton translocation across the energy-transducing inner membrane, providing electrons for respiration and driving ATP synthesis. Mammalian complex I contains 44 different nuclear-and mitochondrial-encoded subunits, with a combined mass of 1MDa. The 14 conserved 'core' subunits have been structurally defined in the minimal, bacterial complex, but the structures and arrangement of the 30 'supernumerary' subunits are unknown. Here we describe a 5 angstrom resolution structure of complex I from Bos taurus heart mitochondria, a close relative of the human enzyme, determined by single-particle electron cryo-microscopy. Wepresent the structures of themammalian core subunits that contain eight iron-sulphur clusters and 60 transmembrane helices, identify 18 supernumerary transmembrane helices, and assign and model 14 supernumerary subunits. Thus, we considerably advance knowledge of the structure of mammalian complex I and the architecture of its supernumerary ensemble around the core domains.

In the cores of many clusters, radiative energy losses from the ICM occur on timescalesmuch shorter than the age of the system(1-3). Unchecked, this cooling would lead to massive accumulations of cold gas and vigorous star formation(4), in contradiction to observations(5). Various sources of energy capable of compensating for these cooling losses have been proposed, themost promising being heating by the super-massive black holes in the central galaxies, through inflation of bubbles of relativistic plasma(6-9). Regardless of the original source of energy, the question of how this energy is transferred to the ICM remains open. Here we present a plausible solution to this question based on deep X-ray data and a new data analysis method that enable us to evaluate directly the ICM heating rate from the dissipation of turbulence. We find that turbulent heating is sufficient to offset radiative cooling and indeed appears to balance it locally at each radius-it may therefore be the key element in resolving the gas cooling problem in cluster cores and, more universally, in the atmospheres of X-ray emitting, gas-rich systems on scales from galaxy clusters to groups and elliptical galaxies.","[Zhuravleva, I.; Allen, S.

In addition, some white dwarfs with strong fields vary in brightness as they rotate(7-10), which has been variously attributed to surface brightness inhomogeneities similar to sunspots(8-12), chemical inhomogeneities(13,14) and other magneto-optical effects(15-17). Here we describe optical observations of the brightness and magnetic field of the cool white dwarf WD 1953-011 taken over about eight years, and the results of an analysis of its surface temperature and magnetic field distribution. We find that the magnetic field suppresses atmospheric convection, leading to dark spots in the most magnetized areas. We also find that strong fields are sufficient to suppress convection over the entire surface in cool magnetic white dwarfs, which inhibits their cooling evolution relative to weakly magnetic and non-magnetic white dwarfs, making them appear younger than they truly are. This explains the long-standing mystery of why magnetic fields are more common amongst cool white dwarfs, and implies that the currently accepted ages of strongly magnetic white dwarfs are systematically too young.","[Valyavin, G.; Burlakova, T.; Burenkov, A.] Russian Acad Sci, Special Astrophys Observ, Nizhnii Arkhyz 369167, Zelenchukskiy R, Russia; [Shulyak, D.] Univ Gottingen, Inst Astrophys, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Wade, G.

The plasma wakefield accelerator is one concept(1-3) being developed for this purpose. In plasma wakefield acceleration, a charge-density wake with high accelerating fields is driven by the passage of an ultra-relativistic bunch of charged particles (the drive bunch) through a plasma(4-6). If a second bunch of relativistic electrons (the trailing bunch) with sufficient charge follows in the wake of the drive bunch at an appropriate distance, it can be efficiently accelerated to high energy. Previous experiments using just a single 42-gigaelectronvolt drive bunch have accelerated electrons with a continuous energy spectrum and a maximum energy of upto 85 gigaelectronvolts from the tail of the same bunch in less than a metre of plasma(7). However, the total charge of these accelerated electrons was insufficient to extract a substantial amount of energy from the wake. Here we report high-efficiency acceleration of a discrete trailing bunch of electrons that contains sufficient charge to extract a substantial amount of energy from the high-gradient, non-linear plasma wakefield accelerator. Specifically, we show the acceleration of about 74 picocoulombs of charge contained in the core of the trailing bunch in an accelerating gradient of about 4.4 gigavolts per metre. These core particles gain about 1.6 gigaelectronvolts of energy per particle, with a final energy spread as low as 0.7 per cent (2.0 per cent on average), and an energy-transfer efficiency from the wake to the bunch that can exceed 30 per cent (17.7 per cent on average). This acceleration of a distinct bunch of electrons containing a substantial charge and having a small energy spread with both a high accelerating gradient and a high energy-transfer efficiency represents a milestone in the development of plasma wakefield acceleration into a compact and affordable accelerator technology.","[Litos, M.; Adli, E.; Clarke, C.

Solution-processed light-emitting diodes (LEDs) using conjugated polymers or quantum dots as emitters have attracted great interest over the past two decades(1,2). However, the overall performance of solution-processed LEDs(2-5)-including their efficiency, efficiency roll-off at high current densities, turn-on voltage and lifetime under operational conditions-remains inferior to that of the best vacuum deposited organic LEDs(6-8). Here we report a solution-processed, multilayer quantum-dot-based LED with excellent performance and reproducibility. It exhibits colour-saturated deep-redemission, subband gap turn-on at 1.7 volts, high external quantum efficiencies of up to 20.5 per cent, low efficiency roll-off (up to 15.1 per cent of the external quantum efficiency at 100 mA cm(-2)), anda long operational lifetime of more than 100,000 hours at 100 cd m(-2), making this device the best-performing solution-processed red LED so far, comparable to state-of-the-art vacuum-deposited organic LEDs(2-8). This optoelectronic performance is achieved by inserting an insulating layer between the quantum dot layer and the oxide electron-transport layer to optimize charge balance in the device and preserve the superior emissive properties of the quantum dots. We anticipate that our results will be a starting point for further research, leading to high-performance, all-solution-processed quantum-dot-based LEDs ideal for next-generation display and solid-state lighting technologies.","[Dai, Xingliang; Jin, Yizheng; Liang, Xiaoyong] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Ctr Chem High Performance & Novel Mat, State Key Lab Silicon Mat,Cyrus Tang Ctr Sensor M, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Zhenxing; Niu, Yuan; Cao, Hujia; Peng, Xiaogang] Zhejiang Univ, Dept Chem, Ctr Chem High Performance & Novel Mat, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Chen, Liwei] Chinese Acad Sci, I Lab, Suzhou Inst Nanotech & Nanobion, Suzhou 215123, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jianpu] Nanjing Tech Univ NanjingTech, Key Lab Flexible Elect KLOFE, Nanjing 211816, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jianpu] Nanjing Tech Univ NanjingTech, Natl Jiangsu Synergist Innovat Ctr Adv Mat SICAM, Inst Adv Mat IAM, Nanjing 211816, Peoples R China","Jin, YZ (reprint author), Zhejiang Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Ctr Chem High Performance & Novel Mat, State Key Lab Silicon Mat,Cyrus Tang Ctr Sensor M, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",yizhengjin@zju.edu.cn; xpeng@zju.edu.cn,"peng, xiaogang/R-6184-2016","peng, xiaogang/0000-0002-5606-8472","National High Technology Research and Development Program of China [2011AA050520]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [21233005, 51172203]; Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar of Zhejiang Province [R4110189]; Public Welfare Project of Zhejiang Province [2013C31057]; Jiangsu Natural Science Foundation [BK20130006, BK20131413]; National Basic Research Program of China [2015CB932200]; Jiangsu Specially-Appointed Professor programme","This work is financially supported by the National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (2011AA050520), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (21233005 and 51172203), the Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar of Zhejiang Province (R4110189), the Public Welfare Project of Zhejiang Province (2013C31057), the Jiangsu Natural Science Foundation (BK20130006 and BK20131413), the National Basic Research Program of China (2015CB932200) and the Jiangsu Specially-Appointed Professor programme.

And visible light has been recognized as an environmentally friendly and sustainable form of energy for triggering chemical transformations and catalytic chemical processes(2-5). For these reasons, visible-light-driven catalytic asymmetric chemistry is a subject of enormous current interest(2-5). Photoredox catalysis provides the opportunity to generate highly reactive radical ion intermediates with often unusual or unconventional reactivities under surprisingly mild reaction conditions(6). In such systems, photoactivated sensitizers initiate a single electron transfer from(or to) a closed-shell organic molecule to produce radical cations or radical anions whose reactivities are then exploited for interesting or unusual chemical transformations. However, the high reactivity of photoexcited substrates, intermediate radical ions or radicals, and the low activation barriers for follow-up reactions provide significant hurdles for the development of efficient catalytic photochemical processes that work under stereochemical control and provide chiral molecules in an asymmetric fashion(7). Here we report a highly efficient asymmetric catalyst that uses visible light for the necessary molecular activation, thereby combining asymmetric catalysis and photocatalysis. We show that a chiral iridium complex can serve as a sensitizer for photoredox catalysis and at the same time provide very effective asymmetric induction for the enantioselective alkylation of 2-acyl imidazoles. This new asymmetric photoredox catalyst, in which the metal centre simultaneously serves as the exclusive source of chirality, the catalytically active Lewis acid centre, and the photoredox centre, offers new opportunities for the 'green' synthesis of non-racemic chiral molecules.","[Huo, Haohua; Shen, Xiaodong; Wang, Chuanyong; Zhang, Lilu; Roese, Philipp; Harms, Klaus; Marsch, Michael; Hilt, Gerhard; Meggers, Eric] Univ Marburg, Fachbereich Chem, D-35043 Marburg, Germany; [Chen, Liang-An; Meggers, Eric] Xiamen Univ, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China","Meggers, E (reprint author), Univ Marburg, Fachbereich Chem, Hans Meerwein Str, D-35043 Marburg, Germany.",meggers@chemie.uni-marburg.de,"Meggers, Eric/B-8541-2014","Meggers, Eric/0000-0002-8851-7623",German Research Foundation [ME 1805/4-1]; China Scholarship Council,We acknowledge funding from the German Research Foundation (ME 1805/4-1).

The chemical inertness of chlorofluorocarbons allows their transport and mixing throughout the troposphere on a global scale(1), before they reach the stratosphere where they release chlorine atoms that cause ozone depletion(2). The large ozone loss over Antarctica(3) was the key observation that stimulated the definition and signing in 1987 of the Montreal Protocol, an international treaty establishing a schedule to reduce the production of the major chlorine-and bromine-containing halocarbons. Owing to its implementation, the near-surface total chlorine concentration showed a maximum in 1993, followed by a decrease of half a per cent to one per cent per year(4), in line with expectations. Remote-sensing data have revealed a peak in stratospheric chlorine after 1996(5), then a decrease of close to one per cent per year(6,7), in agreement with the surface observations of the chlorine source gases and model calculations(7). Here we present ground-based and satellite data that show a recent and significant increase, at the 2 sigma level, in hydrogen chloride (HCl), the main stratospheric chlorine reservoir, starting around 2007 in the lower stratosphere of the Northern Hemisphere, in contrast with the ongoing monotonic decrease of near-surface source gases. Using model simulations, we attribute this trend anomaly to a slow down in the Northern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation, occurring over several consecutive years, transporting more aged air to the lower stratosphere, and characterized by a larger relative conversion of source gases to HCl. This short-term dynamical variability will also affect other stratospheric tracers and needs to be accounted for when studying the evolution of the stratospheric ozone layer.","[Mahieu, E.; Franco, B.; Servais, C.] Univ Liege, Inst Astrophys & Geophys, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; [Chipperfield, M.

Here we show that selection for niche differentiation between species can drive this increasing biodiversity effect. Growing 12 grassland species in test monocultures and mixtures, we found character displacement between species and increased biodiversity effects when plants had been selected over 8 years in species mixtures rather than in monocultures. When grown in mixtures, relative differences in height and specific leaf area between plant species selected in mixtures (mixture types) were greater than between species selected inmonocultures (monoculture types). Furthermore, net biodiversity and complementarity effects(1,2) were greater in mixtures of mixture types than inmixtures of monoculture types. Our study demonstrates a novel mechanism for the increase in biodiversity effects: selection for increased niche differentiation through character displacement. Selection in diverse mixtures may therefore increase species coexistence and ecosystem functioning in natural communities and may also allow increased mixture yields in agriculture or forestry. However, loss of biodiversity and prolonged selection of crops in monoculture may compromise this potential for selection in the longer term.","[Zuppinger-Dingley, Debra; Schmid, Bernhard; Yadav, Varuna; Flynn, Dan F.

The key signalling factors are Wnt family proteins for the anterior-posterior axis, Bmp family proteins for the dorsal-ventral axis and Nodal for the left-right axis(1). Cnidarians, the sister group to bilaterians, are characterized by one oral-aboral body axis, which exhibits a distinct biradiality of unknown molecular nature. Here we analysed the biradial growth pattern in the radially symmetrical cni-darian polyp Hydra, and we report evidence of Nodal ina pre-bilaterian clade. We identified aNodal-related gene (Ndr) inHydra magnipa-pillata, and this gene is essential for setting up an axial asymmetry along the main body axis. This asymmetry defines a lateral signalling centre, inducing a new body axis of a budding polyp orthogonal to the mother polyp's axis. Ndr is expressed exclusively in the lateral bud anlage and induces Pitx, which encodes an evolutionarily conserved transcription factor that functions downstream of Nodal. Reminiscent of its function in vertebrates(2,3), Nodal acts downstream of beta-Catenin signalling. Our data support an evolutionary scenario in which a 'core-signalling cassette' consisting of b-Catenin, Nodal and Pitx pre-dated the cnidarian-bilaterian split. We presume that this cassette was co-opted for various modes of axial patterning: for example, for lateral branching in cnidarians and left-right patterning in bilaterians.","[Watanabe, Hiroshi; Kuhn, Anne; Hoeger, Stefanie K.; Kocagoez, Yigit; Laumann-Lipp, Nico; Oezbek, Suat; Holstein, Thomas W.] Heidelberg Univ, Dept Mol Evolut & Genom, Ctr Organismal Studies COS, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Schmidt, Heiko A.] Univ Vienna, Med Univ Vienna, Ctr Integrat Bioinformat Vienna CIBIV, Max F Perutz Labs MFPL, A-1030 Vienna, Austria","Holstein, TW (reprint author), Heidelberg Univ, Dept Mol Evolut & Genom, Ctr Organismal Studies COS, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.",hiroshi.watanabe@cos.uni-heidelberg.de; thomas.holstein@cos.uni-heidelberg.de,"Ozbek, Suat/D-3701-2014",,"TOYOBO Biotechnology Foundation; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation; Heidelberg Excellence Cluster Cellular Networks; German science foundation (DFG) [FOR 1036/TP1, SFB 873/A1, FOR 1036/TP2]","We thank R.

Hebbian forms of LTPdependon strong postsynaptic depolarization, which in many models is generated by action potentials that propagate back from the soma into dendrites(2,3). However, local dendritic depolarization has been shown to mediate these forms of LTP as well(1,4,5). As pyramidal cells in supragranular layers of the somatosensory cortex spike infrequently(6-8), it is unclear which of the two mechanisms prevails for those cellsin vivo. Using whole-cell recordings in the mouse somatosensory cortexin vivo, we demonstrate that rhythmic sensory whisker stimulation efficiently induces synaptic LTP in layer 2/3 (L2/3) pyramidal cells in the absence of somatic spikes. The induction of LTP depended on the occurrence of NMDAR(N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor)-mediated long-lasting depolarizations, which bear similarities to dendritic plateau potentials(9-13). In addition, we show that whisker stimuli recruit synaptic networks that originate from the posteromedial complex of the thalamus (POm). Photostimulation of channelrhodopsin-2 expressing POm neurons generated NMDAR mediated plateau potentials, whereas the inhibition of POm activity during rhythmic whisker stimulation suppressed the generation of those potentials and prevented whisker-evoked LTP. Taken together, our data provide evidence for sensory-driven synaptic LTP in vivo, in the absence of somatic spiking. Instead, LTP is mediated by plateau potentials that are generated through the cooperative activity of lemniscal and paralemniscal synaptic circuitry(14-16).","[Gambino, Frederic; Pages, Stephane; Kehayas, Vassilis; Baptista, Daniela; Tatti, Roberta; Carleton, Alan; Holtmaat, Anthony] Univ Geneva, Dept Basic Neurosci, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Gambino, Frederic; Pages, Stephane; Kehayas, Vassilis; Baptista, Daniela; Tatti, Roberta; Carleton, Alan; Holtmaat, Anthony] Univ Geneva, CMU, Ctr Neurosci, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Kehayas, Vassilis; Tatti, Roberta] Leman Neurosci Doctoral Sch, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland","Holtmaat, A (reprint author), Univ Geneva, Dept Basic Neurosci, 1 Rue Michel Servet, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland.",anthony.holtmaat@unige.ch,"Carleton, Alan/C-9721-2010","Carleton, Alan/0000-0001-5633-9159; Kehayas, Vassilis/0000-0002-8759-2808","Swiss National Science Foundation [31003A_120685, 31003A_135631, CRSI33_127289, 31003A_153410]; National Centre of Competence in Research (NCCR) SYNAPSY - Swiss National Science Foundation [51AU40_125759]; International Foundation for Research on Paraplegia; Hans Wilsdorf Foundation; SyMBaD (EU FP7-PEOPLE-ITN Marie Curie) [238608]","We thank E.

The self-organizing nature of morphogenesis has been recently demonstrated by studies showing that stem cells in three-dimensional culture can generate complex organoids, such as mini-guts(2), optic-cups(3) and even mini-brains(4). To achieve this, cell collectives must regulate the activity of secreted signalling molecules that control cell differentiation, presumably through the self-assembly of microenvironments or niches. However, mechanisms that allow changes in tissue architecture to feedback directly on the activity of extracellular signals have not been described. Here we investigate how the process of tissue assembly controls signalling activity during organogenesis in vivo, using the migrating zebrafish lateral line primordium(5). We show that fibroblast growth factor (FGF) activity within the tissue controls the frequency at which it deposits rosette-like mechanosensory organs. Live imaging reveals that FGF becomes specifically concentrated in microluminal structures that assemble at the centre of these organs and spatially constrain its signalling activity. Genetic inhibition of microlumen assembly and laser micropuncture experiments demonstrate that microlumina increase signalling responses in participating cells, thus allowing FGF to coordinate the migratory behaviour of cell groups at the tissue rear. As the formation of a central lumen is a self-organizing property of many cell types, such as epithelia(6) and embryonic stem cells(7), luminal signalling provides a potentially general mechanism to locally restrict, coordinate and enhance cell communication within tissues.","[Durdu, Sevi; Iskar, Murat; Revenu, Celine; Schieber, Nicole; Kunze, Andreas; Bork, Peer; Schwab, Yannick; Gilmour, Darren] European Mol Biol Lab Heidelberg, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany","Gilmour, D (reprint author), European Mol Biol Lab Heidelberg, Meyerhofstr 1, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany.",gilmour@embl.de,,"Iskar, Murat/0000-0001-6448-8779; Schwab, Yannick/0000-0001-8027-1836; Durdu, Sevi/0000-0001-9746-6779; Bork, Peer/0000-0002-2627-833X",European Molecular Biology Organization; EMBL Interdisciplinary Postdocs (EIPOD); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB 488],"We are grateful to J.

Simultaneously, plants display tropisms, rapid adjustments of their direction of growth to adapt to environmental conditions. It is unclear how stable zonation is maintained during transient adjustments in growth direction. In Arabi-dopsis roots, many aspects of zonation are controlled by the phytohormone auxin and auxin-induced PLETHORA(PLT) transcription factors, both of which display a graded distribution with a maximum near the root tip(2-12). In addition, auxin is also pivotal for tropic responses(13,14). Here, using an iterative experimental and computational approach, we show how an interplay between auxin and PLTs controls zonation and gravitropism. We find that the PLT gradient is not a direct, proportionate readout of the auxin gradient. Rather, prolonged high auxin levels generate a narrow PLT transcription domain from which a gradient of PLT protein is subsequently generated through slow growth dilution and cell-to-cell movement. The resulting PLT levels define the location of developmental zones. In addition to slowly promoting PLT transcription, auxin also rapidly influences division, expansion and differentiation rates. We demonstrate how this specific regulatory design in which auxin cooperates with PLTs through different mechanisms and on different time scales enables both the fast tropic environmental responses and stable zonation dynamics necessary for coordinated cell differentiation.","[Maehoenen, Ari Pekka; Siligato, Riccardo; Smetana, Ondrej] Univ Helsinki, Inst Biotechnol, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Maehoenen, Ari Pekka; Diaz-Trivino, Sara; Wachsman, Guy; Prasad, Kalika; Heidstra, Renze; Scheres, Ben] Univ Utrecht, Dept Biol, NL-3584 CH Utrecht, Netherlands; [Maehoenen, Ari Pekka; Siligato, Riccardo; Smetana, Ondrej; Salojaervi, Jarkko] Univ Helsinki, Dept Biosci, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [ten Tusscher, Kirsten] Univ Utrecht, NL-3584 CH Utrecht, Netherlands; [Diaz-Trivino, Sara; Heidstra, Renze; Scheres, Ben] Wageningen Univ Res, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands","Mahonen, AP (reprint author), Univ Helsinki, Inst Biotechnol, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",AriPekka.Mahonen@helsinki.fi; ben.scheres@wur.nl,"Mahonen, Ari Pekka/B-9764-2015; ten Tusscher, Kirsten/B-9427-2011; Salojarvi, Jarkko/E-9103-2016","Mahonen, Ari Pekka/0000-0001-6051-866X; Salojarvi, Jarkko/0000-0002-4096-6278; Scheres, Ben/0000-0001-5400-9578",Human Frontier Science Program fellowship; European Research Council Advanced Investigator Fellowship SysArc; SPINOZA award; ALW-NWO European Research Area Network Plant Genomics (ERAPG) grant [855.50.017]; Academy of Finland; Biocentrum Helsinki; University of Helsinki; Integrative Life Science Doctoral Program; Marie Curie Intra-European Fellowship [IEF-2008-237643]; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)-Horizon grant; NWO-ALW grant; EMBO Long-term fellowship,"We thank M.

Whether tumour-infiltrating immune cells can oppose senescence is unknown. Here we show that at the onset of senescence, PTEN null prostate tumours inmice(2,7) are massively infiltrated by a population of CD11b(+)Gr-1(+) myeloid cells that protect a fraction of proliferating tumour cells from senescence, thus sustaining tumour growth. Mechanistically, we found that Gr-1(+) cells antagonize senescence in a paracrine manner by interfering with the senescence-associated secretory phenotype of the tumour through the secretion of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA). Strikingly, Pten-loss-induced cellular senescence was enhanced in vivo when Il1ra knockout myeloid cells were adoptively transferred to PTEN null mice. Therapeutically, docetaxel-induced senescence and efficacy were higher in PTEN null tumours when the percentage of tumour-infiltrating CD11b(+)Gr-1(+)myeloid cells was reduced using an antagonist of CXC chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2)(8). Taken together, our findings identify a novel non-cell-autonomous network, established by innate immunity, that controls senescence evasion and chemoresistance. Targeting this network provides novel opportunities for cancer therapy.","[Di Mitri, Diletta; Toso, Alberto; Chen, Jing Jing; Sarti, Manuela; Pinton, Sandra; Garcia-Escudero, Ramon; Guccini, Ilaria; Catapano, Carlo; Alimonti, Andrea] Oncol Inst Southern Switzerland, Inst Oncol Res IOR, CH-6500 Bellinzona, Switzerland; [Chen, Jing Jing; Alimonti, Andrea] Univ Lausanne UNIL, Fac Biol & Med, CH-1011 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Jost, Tanja Rezzonico; D'Antuono, Rocco; Montani, Erica; Grassi, Fabio] Inst Res Biomed IRB, CH-6500 Bellinzona, Switzerland; [Garcia-Escudero, Ramon] CIEMAT, Mol Oncol Unit, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Da Silva-Alvarez, Sabela; Collado, Manuel] Clin Univ Hosp CHUS, StemCHUS Hlth Res Inst Santiago de Compostela IDI, Lab Stem Cells Canc & Aging, E-15706 Santiago De Compostela, Spain; [Eisenberger, Mario] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Oncol, Sidney Kimmel Comprehens Canc Ctr, Baltimore, MD 21231 USA; [Zhang, Zhe] Johns Hopkins Univ, Div Biostat, Sidney Kimmel Comprehens Canc Ctr, Baltimore, MD 21231 USA; [Grassi, Fabio] Univ Milan, Dept Med Biotechnol & Translat Med, I-20100 Milan, Italy","Alimonti, A (reprint author), Oncol Inst Southern Switzerland, Inst Oncol Res IOR, CH-6500 Bellinzona, Switzerland.",andrea.alimonti@ior.iosi.ch,"Collado, Manuel/K-8140-2014; Garcia-Escudero, Ramon/A-2735-2012","Collado, Manuel/0000-0002-0330-0880; Garcia-Escudero, Ramon/0000-0001-5640-6542; Da Silva Alvarez, Sabela/0000-0003-2702-8524; GRASSI, FABIO/0000-0003-3348-1712","Department of Defense Prostate Cancer Research Program [W81XWH-10-2-0056, W81XWH-10-2-0046]; Swiss national science foundation (SNF) grant Ambizione [PZ00P3_136612/1]; European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) translational research award; Swiss Bridge Award; PEOPLE-IRG [22484]; European Research Council [ERCsg 261342]; ABREOC; Train COFUND Marie Curie; Fondazione IBSA","We thank L.

Here we report a broad and extremely potent HIV-specific monoclonal antibody, termed 35O22, which binds a novel HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) epitope. 35O22 neutralized 62% of 181 pseudoviruses with a half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50)<50 mu gml(-1). The median IC50 of neutralized viruses was 0.033 mu gml(-1), among themost potent thus far described. 35O22 did not bind monomeric forms of Env tested, but did bind the trimeric BG505 SOSIP. 664. Mutagenesis and a reconstruction by negative-stain electron microscopy of the Fab in complex with trimer revealed that it bound to a conserved epitope, which stretched across gp120 and gp41. The specificity of 35O22 represents a novel site of vulnerability on HIV Env, which serum analysis indicates to be commonly elicited by natural infection. Binding to this new site of vulnerability may thus be an important complement to current monoclonal-antibody-based approaches to immunotherapies, prophylaxis and vaccine design.","[Huang, Jinghe; Kang, Byong H.; Imamichi, Hiromi; Laub, Leo; Migueles, Stephen A.; Connors, Mark] NIAID, Immunoregulat Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Pancera, Marie; Georgiev, Ivelin S.; Chuang, Gwo-Yu; Druz, Aliaksandr; Doria-Rose, Nicole A.; Bailer, Robert T.; Mascola, John R.; Kwong, Peter D.] NIAID, Vaccine Res Ctr, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Lee, Jeong Hyun; Wyatt, Richard T.; Ward, Andrew B.] Scripps Res Inst, Scripps Ctr HIV AIDS Vaccine Immunol & Immunogen, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Lee, Jeong Hyun; Feng, Yu; Wyatt, Richard T.; Ward, Andrew B.] Scripps Res Inst, Int AIDS Vaccine Initiat IAVI Neutralizing Antibo, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Tong, Tommy; Binley, James M.] San Diego Biomed Res Inst, San Diego, CA 92121 USA; [Sliepen, Kwinten; van Gils, Marit J.; de la Pena, Alba Torrents; Derking, Ronald; Sanders, Rogier W.] Univ Amsterdam, Acad Med Ctr, Dept Med Microbiol, NL-1100 DD Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Klasse, Per-Johan; Pugach, Pavel; Sanders, Rogier W.] Cornell Univ, Weill Med Coll, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Alam, Munir; Haynes, Barton F.] Duke Univ, Duke Human Vaccine Inst, Durham, NC 27710 USA","Connors, M (reprint author), NIAID, Immunoregulat Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",mconnors@nih.gov,"Ward, Andrew/F-9203-2014; Huang, Jinghe/O-1986-2015; Koyuncu, ayfer/M-3872-2015","Ward, Andrew/0000-0001-7153-3769; van Gils, Marit J./0000-0003-3422-8161","Intramural Research Programs of NIAID, National Institutes of Health; NIH HIVRAD grant [P01 AI082362]; Aids Fonds Netherlands [2011032, 2012041]; Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO); European Research Council [ERC-StG-2011-280829-SHEV]; International AIDS Vaccine Initiative; NIH [AI93278, AI84714]; US Department of Energy, Basic Energy Sciences, Office of Science [W-31-109-Eng-38]","We thank J.

Pseudouridine, the most abundant modified nucleoside in non-codingRNAs(1), enhances the function of transfer RNA and ribosomal RNA by stabilizing the RNA structure(2-8). Messenger RNAs were not known to contain pseudouridine, but artificial pseudouridylation dramatically affects mRNA function-it changes the genetic code by facilitating non-canonical base pairing in the ribosome decoding centre(9,10). However, without evidence of naturally occurring mRNA pseudouridylation, its physiological relevance was unclear. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of pseudouridylation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and human RNAs using Pseudo-seq, a genome-wide, single-nucleotide-resolution method for pseudouridine identification. Pseudo-seq accurately identifies known modification sites aswell as many novel sites in non-coding RNAs, and reveals hundreds of pseudouridylated sites in mRNAs. Genetic analysis allowed us to assign most of the new modification sites to one of seven conserved pseudouridine synthases, Pus1-4, 6, 7 and 9. Notably, the majority of pseudouridines in mRNA are regulated in response to environmental signals, such as nutrient deprivation in yeast and serum starvation in human cells. These results suggest a mechanism for the rapid and regulated rewiring of the genetic code through inducible mRNA modifications. Our findings reveal unanticipated roles for pseudouridylation and provide a resource for identifying the targets of pseudouridine synthases implicated in human disease(11-13).","[Carlile, Thomas M.; Rojas-Duran, Maria F.; Zinshteyn, Boris; Shin, Hakyung; Bartoli, Kristen M.; Gilbert, Wendy V.] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Gilbert, WV (reprint author), MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",wgilbert@mit.edu,,"Carlile, Thomas/0000-0002-7699-9354; /0000-0003-2807-9657; Zinshteyn, Boris/0000-0003-0103-3501","American Cancer Society - Robbie Sue Mudd Kidney Cancer Research Scholar Grant [RSG-13-396-01-RMC]; National Institutes of Health [GM094303, GM081399]; American Cancer Society New England Division (Ellison Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowship); American Cancer Society [PF-13-319-01 - RMC]; NIH Pre-Doctoral Training Grant [T32GM007287]","We thank I.

In the I-E subtype CRISPR/Cas system, eleven subunits from five Cas proteins (CasA(1)B(2)C(6)D(1)E(1)) assemble along a CRISPR RNA (crRNA) to form the Cascade complex(10-13). Here we report on the 3.05 angstrom crystal structure of the 405-kilodalton Escherichia coli Cascade complex that provides molecular details beyond those available from earlier lower-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structures. The bound 61-nucleotide crRNA spans the entire 11-protein subunit-containing complex, where it interacts with all six CasC subunits (named CasC1-6), with its 5 ' and 3 ' terminal repeats anchored by CasD and CasE, respectively. The crRNA spacer region is positioned along a continuous groove on the concave surface generated by the aligned CasC1-6 subunits. The five long beta-hairpins that project from individual CasC2-6 subunits extend across the crRNA, with each beta-hairpin inserting into the gap between the last stacked base and its adjacent splayed counterpart, and positioned within the groove of the preceding CasC subunit. Therefore, instead of continuously stacking, the crRNA spacer region is divided into five equal fragments, with each fragment containing five stacked bases flanked by one flipped-out base. Each of those crRNA spacer fragments interacts with CasC in a similar fashion. Furthermore, our structure explains why the seed sequence, with its outward directed bases, has a critical role in target DNA recognition. Inconclusion, our structure of the Cascade complex provides novel molecular details of protein-protein and protein-RNA alignments and interactions required for generation of a complex mediating RNA-guided immune surveillance.","[Zhao, Hongtu; Sheng, Gang; Wang, Jiuyu; Wang, Min; Gong, Weimin; Wang, Yanli] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Biophys, Lab RNA Biol, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Hongtu] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Bunkoczi, Gabor] Addenbrookes Hosp, Cambridge Inst Med Res, Cambridge CB2 0XY, England; [Wei, Zhiyi] South Univ Sci & Technol China, Dept Biol, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China","Wang, YL (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Biophys, Lab RNA Biol, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",wei.zy@sustc.edu.cn; ylwang@ibp.ac.cn,"Wei, Zhiyi/C-4315-2014","Wei, Zhiyi/0000-0002-4446-6502","Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology [2014CB910102, 2011CBA01105]; Natural Science Foundation of China [31222014, 31170705]; Strategic Priority Research program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB08010203]; South University of Science and Technology of China; Shenzhen Government","We thank the staff at beamline BL-17U at Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF), and beamlines BL-1A, BL-5A and BL-17A at Photon Factory.

These fossils reveal many craniodental and post-cranial features of euharamiyidans and clarify several ambiguous structures that are currently the topic of debate. Our phylogenetic analyses recognize Euharamiyida as the sister group of Multituberculata, and place Allotheria within the Mammalia. The phylogeny suggests that allotherian mammals evolved from a Late Triassic (approximately 208 million years ago) Haramiyavia-like ancestor and diversified into euharamiyidans and multituberculates with a cosmopolitan distribution, implying homologous acquisition of many craniodental and postcranial features in the two groups.

Here, using genetic fate map techniques, we demonstrate that cardiac fibroblasts rapidly adopt an endothelial-cell-like phenotype after acute ischaemic cardiac injury. Fibroblast-derived endothelial cells exhibit anatomical and functional characteristics of native endothelial cells. We show that the transcription factor p53 regulates such a switch in cardiac fibroblast fate. Loss of p53 in cardiac fibroblasts severely decreases the formation of fibroblast-derived endothelial cells, reduces post-infarct vascular density and worsens cardiac function. Conversely, stimulation of the p53 pathway in cardiac fibroblasts augments mesenchymal-to-endothelial transition, enhances vascularity and improves cardiac function. These observations demonstrate that mesenchymal-to-endothelial transition contributes to neovascularization of the injured heart and represents a potential therapeutic target for enhancing cardiac repair.","[Ubil, Eric] Univ N Carolina, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol & Physiol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Duan, Jinzhu; Pillai, Indulekha C.

This group includes the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), which ubiquitylates nucleosomal histone H2A Lys 119 using its E3 ubiquitin ligase subunits, Ring1B and Bmi1, together with an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, UbcH5c. However, the molecular mechanism of nucleosome substrate recognition by PRC1 or other chromatin enzymes is unclear. Here we present the crystal structure of the human Ring1B-Bmi1-UbcH5c E3-E2 complex (the PRC1 ubiquitylation module) bound to its nucleosome core particle substrate. The structure shows how a chromatin enzyme achieves substrate specificity by interacting with several nucleosome surfaces spatially distinct from the site of catalysis. Our structure further reveals an unexpected role for the ubiquitin E2 enzyme in substrate recognition, and provides insight into how the related histone H2A E3 ligase, BRCA1, interacts with and ubiquitylates the nucleosome.","[McGinty, Robert K.; Henrici, Ryan C.; Tan, Song] Penn State Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Ctr Eukaryot Gene Regulat, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Henrici, Ryan C.] Penn State Univ, Schreyer Honors Coll, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Tan, S (reprint author), Penn State Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Ctr Eukaryot Gene Regulat, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",sxt30@psu.edu,,,"NIGMS [GM060489-09S1, GM088236, GM111651]; Damon Runyon Post-doctoral fellowship [DRG 2107-12]","We would like to thank the staff of APS NE-CAT beamlines 24ID-E and 24ID-C for their assistance during synchrotron data collection; H.

Field strengths have been inferred on T Tauri stars(3) and possibly in the innermost part of their accretion disks(4), but the strength and morphology of the field in the bulk of a disk have not beenobserved. Spatially unresolved measurements of polarized emission (arising from elongated dust grains aligned perpendicularly to the field(5)) imply average fields aligned with the disks(6,7). Theoretically, the fields are expected to be largely toroidal, poloidal or a mixture of the two(1,2,8-10), whichimply different mechanisms for transporting angular momentum in the disks of actively accreting young stars such as HL Tau (ref. 11). Here we report resolved measurements of the polarized 1.25-millimetre continuum emission from the disk of HL Tau. The magnetic field on a scale of 80 astronomical units is coincident with the major axis (about 210 astronomical units long(12)) of the disk. From this we conclude that the magnetic field inside the disk at this scale cannot be dominated by a vertical component, though a purely toroidal field also does not fit the data well. The unexpected morphology suggests that the role of the magnetic field in the accretion of a T Tauri star is more complex than our current theoretical understanding.","[Stephens, Ian W.] Boston Univ, Inst Astrophys Res, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Stephens, Ian W.; Looney, Leslie W.; Fernandez-Lopez, Manuel; Crutcher, Richard M.] Univ Illinois, Dept Astron, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Kwon, Woojin] Univ Groningen, SRON Netherlands Inst Space Res, NL-9747 AD Groningen, Netherlands; [Fernandez-Lopez, Manuel] CCT La Plata CONICET, Inst Argentino Radioastron, RA-1894 Villa Elisa, Argentina; [Hughes, A.

In a close binary star (with a separation of less than a hundred astronomical units), theory predicts the presence of circumstellar disks around each star, and an outer circum-binary disk surrounding a gravitationally cleared inner cavity around the stars(4,5). Given that the inner disks are depleted by accretion onto the stars on timescales of a few thousand years, any replenishing material must be transferred from the outer reservoir to fuel planet formation (which occurs on timescales of about one million years). Gas flowing through disk cavities has been detected in single star systems(6). A circumbinary disk was discovered around the young low-mass binary system GG Tau A(ref. 7), which has recently been shown to be a hierarchical triple system(8). It has one large inner disk(9) around the single star, GG Tau Aa, and shows small amounts of shocked hydrogen gas residing within the central cavity(10), but other than a single weak detection(11), the distribution of cold gas in this cavity or in any other binary or multiple star system has not hitherto been determined. Here we report imaging of gas fragments emitting radiation characteristic of carbon monoxide within the GG Tau A cavity. From the kinematics we conclude that the flow appears capable of sustaining the inner disk (around GG Tau Aa) beyond the accretion lifetime, leaving time for planet formation to occur there. These results show the complexity of planet formation around multiple stars and confirm the general picture predicted by numerical simulations.","[Dutrey, Anne; Di Folco, Emmanuel; Guilloteau, Stephane; Chapillon, Edwige; Hure, Jean-Marc; Pierens, Arnaud] Univ Bordeaux, LAB, UMR 5804, F-33270 Floirac, France; [Dutrey, Anne; Di Folco, Emmanuel; Guilloteau, Stephane; Hure, Jean-Marc; Pierens, Arnaud] CNRS, UMR 5804, LAB, F-33270 Floirac, France; [Boehler, Yann] Univ Mexico, CRyA, Morelia 58089, Michoacan, Mexico; [Bary, Jeff] Colgate Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Hamilton, NY 13346 USA; [Beck, Tracy] Space Telescope Sci Inst, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Beust, Herve] IPAG, UMR 5274, F-38041 Grenoble 9, France; [Chapillon, Edwige; Gueth, Frederic; Pietu, Vincent] IRAM, F-38046 St Martin Dheres, France; [Simon, Michal] SUNY Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Tang, Ya-Wen] Acad Sinica, Inst Astron & Astrophys, Taipei 106, Taiwan","Dutrey, A (reprint author), Univ Bordeaux, LAB, UMR 5804, F-33270 Floirac, France.",Anne.Dutrey@obs.u-bordeaux1.fr,,,INSU/CNRS (France); MPG (Germany); IGN (Spain); French programme PNP; French programme PCMI; French programme PNPS; French programme ASA,"ALMA is a partnership of ESO (representing its member states), NSF (USA) and NINS (Japan), together with NRC (Canada) and NSC and ASIAA (Taiwan), in cooperation with the Republic of Chile.

C.",,,Quantum tomography of an electron,NATURE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,STATES; LIGHT; QUBIT,"The complete knowledge of a quantum state allows the prediction of the probability of all possible measurement outcomes, a crucial step in quantum mechanics. It can be provided by tomographic methods(1) which have been applied to atomic(2,3), molecular(4), spin(5,6) and photonic states. For optical(7-9) or microwave(10-13) photons, standard tomography is obtained by mixing the unknown state with a large-amplitude coherent photon field. However, for fermions such as electrons in condensed matter, this approach is not applicable because fermionic fields are limited to small amplitudes (at most one particle per state), and so far no determination of an electron wavefunction has been made. Recent proposals involving quantum conductors suggest that the wavefunction can be obtained by measuring the time-dependent current of electronic wave interferometers(14) or the current noise of electronic Hanbury-Brown/Twiss interferometers(15-17). Here we show that such measurements are possible despite the extreme noise sensitivity required, and present the reconstructed wavefunction quasi-probability, or Wigner distribution function(17), of single electrons injected into a ballistic conductor. Many identical electrons are prepared in well-controlled quantum states called levitons(18) by repeatedly applying Lorentzian voltage pulses to a contact on the conductor(19-21). After passing through an electron beam splitter, the levitons are mixed with a weak-amplitude fermionic field formed by a coherent superposition of electron-hole pairs generated by a small alternating current with a frequency that is a multiple of the voltage pulse frequency(16). Antibunching of the electrons and holes with the levitons at the beam splitter changes the leviton partition statistics, and the noise variations provide the energy density matrix elements of the levitons. This demonstration of quantum tomography makes the developing field of electron quantum optics with ballistic conductors a new test-bed for quantum information with fermions(20,22-24). These results may find direct application in probing the entanglement of electron flying quantum bits(25), electron decoherence(17) and electron interactions. They could also be applied to cold fermionic (or spin-1/2) atoms(26).","[Jullien, T.; Roulleau, P.; Roche, B.; Glattli, D.

It has been demonstrated that atomic-scale structural defects of graphene can host unpaired spins(2,3), but it remains unclear under what conditions long-range magnetic order can emerge from such defect-bound magnetic moments. Here we propose that, in contrast to random defect distributions, atomic-scale engineering of graphene edges with specific crystallographic orientation-comprising edge atoms from only one sub-lattice of the bipartite graphene lattice-can give rise to a robust magnetic order. We use a nanofabrication technique(4) based on scanning tunnelling microscopy to define graphene nanoribbons with nanometre precision and well-defined crystallographic edge orientations. Although so-called 'armchair' ribbons display quantum confinement gaps, ribbons with the 'zigzag' edge structure that are narrower than 7 nanometres exhibit an electronic bandgap of about 0.2-0.3 electronvolts, which can be identified as a signature of interaction-induced spin ordering along their edges. Moreover, upon increasing the ribbon width, a semiconductor-to-metal transition is revealed, indicating the switching of the magnetic coupling between opposite ribbon edges from the antiferromagnetic to the ferromagnetic configuration. We found that the magnetic order on graphene edges of controlled zigzag orientation can be stable even at room temperature, raising hopes of graphene-based spintronic devices operating under ambient conditions.","[Magda, Gabor Zsolt; Vancso, Peter; Osvath, Zoltan; Nemes-Incze, Peter; Biro, Laszlo P.; Tapaszto, Levente] 2D Nanoelect Lendulet Res Grp, Inst Tech Phys & Mat Sci, Nanotechnol Dept, Res Ctr Nat Sci, H-1121 Budapest, Hungary; [Jin, Xiaozhan; Hwang, Chanyong] Korea Res Inst Stand & Sci, Ctr Nanometrol, Taejon 305340, South Korea; [Hagymasi, Imre] Strongly Correlated Syst Lendulet Res Grp, Inst Solid State Phys & Opt, Wigner Res Ctr Phys, H-1121 Budapest, Hungary; [Hagymasi, Imre] Univ Szeged, Dept Theoret Phys, H-6720 Szeged, Hungary","Tapaszto, L (reprint author), 2D Nanoelect Lendulet Res Grp, Inst Tech Phys & Mat Sci, Nanotechnol Dept, Res Ctr Nat Sci, H-1121 Budapest, Hungary.",tapaszto@mfa.kfki.hu,"Nemes - Incze, Peter/C-2298-2008; Tapaszto, Levente/B-4710-2011; Biro, Laszlo/A-3057-2010; Osvath, Zoltan/E-7322-2011; Vancso, Peter/I-6893-2015","Nemes - Incze, Peter/0000-0002-1222-3020; Tapaszto, Levente/0000-0002-9377-8465; Osvath, Zoltan/0000-0003-0440-5446; Vancso, Peter/0000-0003-4333-9787","OTKA [K108753, K101599, K100908]; Bolyai Fellowship; Nano.Material Technology Development Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning [2012M3A7B4049888]; European Union; State of Hungary; European Social Fund [TAMOP-4.2.4.A/2-11/1-2012-0001]; National Excellence Program","The experimental work was conducted within the framework of the Korea Hungary Joint Laboratory for Nanosciences through the Korean Research Council of Fundamental Science and Technology and the ""Lendulet"" programme of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.

Bottom-up(2) and top-down(3) methods can produce nanopores of a size comparable to that of endogenous protein channels, but replicating their affinity and transport properties remains challenging. In principle, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) should be an ideal membrane channel platform: they exhibit excellent transport properties(4-8) and their narrow hydrophobic inner pores mimic structural motifs typical of biological channels(1). Moreover, simulations predict that CNTs with a length comparable to the thickness of a lipid bilayer membrane can self-insert into the membrane(9,10). Functionalized CNTs have indeed been found to penetrate lipid membranes and cell walls(11,12), and short tubes have been forced into membranes to create sensors(13), yet membrane transport applications of short CNTs remain underexplored. Here we show that short CNTs spontaneously insert into lipid bilayers and live cell membranes to form channels that exhibit a unitary conductance of 70-100 picosiemens under physiological conditions. Despite their structural simplicity, these 'CNT porins' transport water, protons, small ions and DNA, stochastically switch between metastable conductance substates, and display characteristic macromolecule-induced ionic current blockades. We also show that local channel and membrane charges can control the conductance and ion selectivity of the CNT porins, thereby establishing these nanopores as a promising biomimetic platform for developing cell interfaces, studying transport in biological channels, and creating stochastic sensors.","[Geng, Jia; Kim, Kyunghoon; Tunuguntla, Ramya; Cho, Kang Rae; Munoz, Dayannara; Noy, Aleksandr] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Phys & Life Sci Directorate, Biol & Biotechnol Div, Livermore, CA 94550 USA; [Geng, Jia; Zhang, Jianfei; Noy, Aleksandr] Univ Calif, Sch Nat Sci, Merced, CA 95340 USA; [Geng, Jia; Kim, Kyunghoon; Tunuguntla, Ramya; Noy, Aleksandr] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kim, Kyunghoon; Grigoropoulos, Costas P.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mech Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Escalada, Artur; Shnyrova, Anna V.; Frolov, Vadim A.] Univ Basque Country, CSIC, Biophys Unit, Leioa 48940, Spain; [Escalada, Artur; Shnyrova, Anna V.; Frolov, Vadim A.] Univ Basque Country, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Leioa 48940, Spain; [Comolli, Luis R.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Life Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Allen, Frances I.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Allen, Frances I.; Ajo-Franklin, Caroline M.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Allen, Frances I.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Natl Ctr Electron Microscopy, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Wang, Y.

The combination of processes responsible for a rise in atmospheric CO2 at the last glacial termination(1,3) (23,000 to 9,000 years ago), however, remains uncertain(1-3). Establishing the timing and rate of CO2 changes in the past provides critical insight into the mechanisms that influence the carbon cycle and helps put present and future anthropogenic emissions in context. Here we present CO2 and methane (CH4) records of the last deglaciation from a new high-accumulation West Antarctic ice core with unprecedented temporal resolution and precise chronology. We show that although low-frequency CO2 variations parallel changes in Antarctic temperature, abrupt CO2 changes occur that have a clear relationship with abrupt climate changes in the Northern Hemisphere. A significant proportion of the direct radiative forcing associated with the rise in atmospheric CO2 occurred in three sudden steps, each of 10 to 15 parts per million. Every step took place in less than two centuries and was followed by no notable change in atmospheric CO2 for about 1,000 to 1,500 years. Slow, millennial-scale ventilation of Southern Ocean CO2-rich, deep-ocean water masses is thought to have been fundamental to the rise in atmospheric CO2 associated with the glacial termination(4), given the strong covariance of CO2 levels and Antarctic temperatures(5). Our data establish a contribution from an abrupt, centennial-scale mode of CO2 variability that is not directly related to Antarctic temperature. We suggest that processes operating on centennial timescales, probably involving the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, seem to be influencing global carbon-cycle dynamics and are at present not widely considered in Earth system models.","[Marcott, Shaun A.; Bauska, Thomas K.; Buizert, Christo; Rosen, Julia L.; Kalk, Michael L.; Brook, Edward J.] Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Marcott, Shaun A.] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Geosci, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Steig, Eric J.; Fudge, T.

In the genome of the demosponge Amphimedon queens-landica, no Hox or ParaHox genes are present, but NK genes are linked in a tight cluster similar to the NK clusters of bilaterians(5). It has been proposed that Hox and ParaHox genes originated from NK cluster genes after divergence of sponges from the lineage leading to cnidarians and bilaterians(5,7). On the other hand, synteny analysis lends support to the notion that the absence of Hox and ParaHox genes in Amphimedon is a result of secondary loss (the ghost locus hypothesis)(8). Here we analysed complete suites of ANTP-class homeoboxes in two calcareous sponges, Sycon ciliatum and Leucosolenia complicata. Our phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that these calcisponges possess orthologues of bilaterian NK genes (Hex, Hmx and Msx), a varying number of additional NK genes and one ParaHox gene, Cdx. Despite the generation of scaffolds spanning multiple genes, we find no evidence of clustering of Sycon NK genes. All Sycon ANTP-class genes are developmentally expressed, with patterns suggesting their involvement in cell type specification in embryos and adults, metamorphosis and body plan patterning. These results demonstrate that ParaHox genes predate the origin of sponges, thus confirming the ghost locus hypothesis(8), and highlight the need to analyse the genomes of multiple sponge lineages to obtain a complete picture of the ancestral composition of the first animal genome.","[Fortunato, Sofia A.

In plants, despite several molecular studies of post-fertilization transcriptional activation, the timing of zygotic genome activation remains a matter of debate. For example, two recent reports that used different hybrid ecotype combinations for RNA sequence profiling of early Arabidopsis embryo transcriptomes came to divergent conclusions. One identified paternal contributions that varied by gene, but with overall maternal dominance(2), while the other found that the maternal and paternal genomes are transcriptionally equivalent(3). Here we assess paternal gene activation functionally in an isogenic background, by performing a large-scale genetic analysis of 49 EMBRYO DEFECTIVE genes and testing the ability of wild-type paternal alleles to complement phenotypes conditioned by mutant maternal alleles. Our results demonstrate that wild-type paternal alleles for nine of these genes are completely functional 2 days after pollination, with the remaining 40 genes showing partial activity beginning at 2, 3 or 5 days after pollination. Using our functional assay, we also demonstrate that different hybrid combinations exhibit significant variation in paternal allele activation, reconciling the apparently contradictory results of previous transcriptional studies(2,3). The variation in timing of gene function that we observe confirms that paternal genome activation does not occur in one early discrete step, provides large-scale functional evidence that maternal and paternal genomes make non-equivalent contributions to early plant embryogenesis, and uncovers an unexpectedly profound effect of hybrid genetic backgrounds on paternal gene activity.","[Del Toro-De Leon, Gerardo; Garcia-Aguilar, Marcelina; Stewart Gillmor, C.] Inst Politecn Nacl CINVESTAV IPN, Ctr Invest & Estudios Avanzados, Unidad Genom Avanzada, Lab Nacl Genom Biodiversidad Langebio, Irapuato 36821, Guanajuato, Mexico","Gillmor, CS (reprint author), Inst Politecn Nacl CINVESTAV IPN, Ctr Invest & Estudios Avanzados, Unidad Genom Avanzada, Lab Nacl Genom Biodiversidad Langebio, Irapuato 36821, Guanajuato, Mexico.",sgillmor@langebio.cinvestav.mx,"Gillmor, Stewart/H-9102-2016",,"CONACyT [300802, 152333]; CINVESTAV","This study was facilitated by the efforts of D.

KRAS mutations are known to be a driver event of PDAC(1), but targeting mutant KRAS has proved challenging(2). Targeting oncogene-driven signalling pathways is a clinically validated approach for several devastating diseases(3,4). Still, despite marked tumour shrinkage, the frequency of relapse indicates that a fraction of tumour cells survives shut down of oncogenic signalling(5,6). Here we explore the role of mutant KRAS in PDAC maintenance using a recently developed inducible mouse model of mutated Kras(1) (Kras(G12D), herein KRas) in a p53(LoxP/WT) background. We demonstrate that a subpopulation of dormant tumour cells surviving oncogene ablation (surviving cells) and responsible for tumour relapse has features of cancer stem cells and relies on oxidative phosphorylation for survival. Transcriptomic and metabolic analyses of surviving cells reveal prominent expression of genes governing mitochondrial function, autophagy and lysosome activity, as well as a strong reliance on mitochondrial respiration and a decreased dependence on glycolysis for cellular energetics. Accordingly, surviving cells show high sensitivity to oxidative phosphorylation inhibitors, which can inhibit tumour recurrence. Our integrated analyses illuminate a therapeutic strategy of combined targeting of the KRAS pathway and mitochondrial respiration to manage pancreatic cancer.","[Viale, Andrea; Pettazzoni, Piergiorgio; Ying, Haoqiang; Sanchez, Nora; Marchesini, Matteo; Carugo, Alessandro; Green, Tessa; Muller, Florian; Colla, Simona; Nezi, Luigi; Genovese, Giannicola; Deem, Angela K.; Kapoor, Avnish; Yao, Wantong; Wang, Y.

Prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas immune systems defend against phage infection byusing Cas nucleases and small RNA guides that specify one or more target sites for cleavage of the viral genome(2,3). Temperate phages include viruses that can integrate into the bacterial chromosome, and they can carry genes that provide a fitness advantage to the lysogenic host(4,5). However, CRISPR-Cas targeting that relies strictly on DNA sequence recognition provides indiscriminate immunity both to lytic and lysogenic infection by temperate phages(6)-compromising the genetic stability of these potentially beneficial elements altogether. Here we show that the Staphylococcus epidermidis CRISPR-Cas system can prevent lytic infection but tolerate lysogenization by temperate phages. Conditional tolerance is achieved through transcription-dependent DNA targeting, and ensures that targeting is resumed upon induction of the prophage lytic cycle. Our results provide evidence for the functional divergence of CRISPR-Cas systems and highlight the importance of targeting mechanism diversity. In addition, they extend the concept of 'tolerance to non-self' to the prokaryotic branch of adaptive immunity.","[Goldberg, Gregory W.; Jiang, Wenyan; Bikard, David; Marraffini, Luciano A.] Rockefeller Univ, Bacteriol Lab, New York, NY 10065 USA","Marraffini, LA (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Bacteriol Lab, New York, NY 10065 USA.",marraffini@rockefeller.edu,"Bikard, David/L-2971-2015","Bikard, David/0000-0002-5729-1211",Searle Scholars Program; Rita Allen Scholars Program; Irma T.

Temporary anorexia associated with an infection is often beneficial(2,3), reallocating energy from food foraging towards resistance to infection(4) or depriving pathogens of nutrients(5). However, it imposes a stress on intestinal commensals, as they also experience reduced substrate availability; this affects host fitness owing to the loss of caloric intake and colonization resistance (protection from additional infections)(6). We hypothesized that the host might utilize internal resources to support the gut microbiota during the acute phase of the disease. Here we show that systemic exposure to Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands causes rapid alpha(1,2)-fucosylation of small intestine epithelial cells (IECs) in mice, which requires the sensing of TLR agonists, as well as the production of interleukin(IL)-23 by dendritic cells, activation of innate lymphoid cells and expression of fucosyltransferase 2 (Fut2) by IL-22-stimulated IECs. Fucosylated proteins are shed into the lumen and fucose is liberated and metabolized by the gut microbiota, as shown by reporter bacteria and community-wide analysis of microbial gene expression. Fucose affects the expression of microbial metabolic pathways and reduces the expression of bacterial virulence genes. It also improves host tolerance of the mild pathogen Citrobacter rodentium. Thus, rapid IEC fucosylation appears to be a protective mechanism that utilizes the host's resources to maintain host-microbial interactions during pathogen-induced stress.","[Pickard, Joseph M.; Chervonsky, Alexander V.] Univ Chicago, Dept Pathol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Pickard, Joseph M.; Chervonsky, Alexander V.] Univ Chicago, Comm Immunol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Maurice, Corinne F.; Turnbaugh, Peter J.] Harvard Univ, FAS Ctr Syst Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kinnebrew, Melissa A.; Abt, Michael C.; Pamer, Eric G.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Schenten, Dominik] Univ Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Golovkina, Tatyana V.] Univ Chicago, Dept Microbiol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Bogatyrev, Said R.; Ismagilov, Rustem F.] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Chervonsky, AV (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Dept Pathol, 5841 S Maryland Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",achervon@bsd.uchicago.edu,,"Chervonsky, Alexander/0000-0001-7547-871X; Turnbaugh, Peter/0000-0002-0888-2875","National Institutes of Health [P50 GM068763, AI96706, AI42135, T32 AI065382]; Harvard Bauer Fellows Program; National Science Foundation [EFRI-1137089]; Digestive Disease Research Core Center [DK42086]; Kenneth Rainin Foundation","We thank C.
