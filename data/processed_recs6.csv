This geological activity could be powered or controlled by variations in the tidal stresses experienced by Enceladus as it moves around its slightly eccentric orbit. The specific mechanisms by which these varying stresses are converted into heat, however, are still being debated(11-16). Furthermore, it has proved difficult to find a clear correlation between the predicted tidal forces and measured temporal variations in the plume's gas content(17-19) or the particle flux from individual sources(20,21). Here we report that the plume's horizontally integrated brightness is several times greater when Enceladus is near the point in its eccentric orbit where it is furthest from Saturn (apocentre) than it is when near the point of closest approach to the planet (pericentre). More material therefore seems to be escaping from beneath Enceladus' surface at times when geophysical models predict its fissures should be under tension(12,15,16) and therefore may be wider open.","[Hedman, M.

The experimental manifestation of this basic principle of quantum mechanics, its link to the quantum nature of light and the extension of quantum measurement to the macroscopic realm have all received extensive attention over the past half-century(1,2). The use of squeezed light, with quantum fluctuations below that of the vacuum field, was proposed nearly three decades ago(3) as a means of reducing the optical read-out noise in precision force measurements. Conversely, it has also been proposed that a continuous measurement of a mirror's position with light may itself give rise to squeezed light(4,5). Such squeezed-light generation has recently been demonstrated in a system of ultracold gas-phase atoms(6) whose centre-of-mass motion is analogous to the motion of a mirror. Here we describe the continuous position measurement of a solid-state, optomechanical system fabricated from a silicon microchip and comprising a micromechanical resonator coupled to a nanophotonic cavity. Laser light sent into the cavity is used to measure the fluctuations in the position of the mechanical resonator at a measurement rate comparable to its resonance frequency and greater than its thermal decoherence rate. Despite the mechanical resonator's highly excited thermal state (10(4) phonons), we observe, through homodyne detection, squeezing of the reflected light's fluctuation spectrum at a level 4.5 +/- 0.2 per cent below that of vacuum noise over a bandwidth of a few megahertz around the mechanical resonance frequency of 28 megahertz. With further device improvements, on-chip squeezing at significant levels should be possible, making such integrated microscale devices well suited for precision metrology applications.","[Safavi-Naeini, Amir H.; Groeblacher, Simon; Hill, Jeff T.; Chan, Jasper; Painter, Oskar] CALTECH, Kavli Nanosci Inst, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Safavi-Naeini, Amir H.; Groeblacher, Simon; Hill, Jeff T.; Chan, Jasper; Painter, Oskar] CALTECH, Thomas J Watson Sr Lab Appl Phys, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Safavi-Naeini, Amir H.; Groeblacher, Simon; Hill, Jeff T.; Painter, Oskar] CALTECH, Inst Quantum Informat & Matter, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Aspelmeyer, Markus] Univ Vienna, Fac Phys, Vienna Ctr Quantum Sci & Technol, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Painter, Oskar] Max Planck Inst Sci Light, D-91058 Erlangen, Germany","Painter, O (reprint author), CALTECH, Kavli Nanosci Inst, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",opainter@caltech.edu,"Hill, Jeffrey/A-5027-2013; Groeblacher, Simon/O-2455-2014; Aspelmeyer, Markus/C-4098-2017","Hill, Jeffrey/0000-0001-6330-2354; Aspelmeyer, Markus/0000-0003-4499-7335; Painter, Oskar/0000-0002-1581-9209","DARPA/MTO ORCHID from the AFOSR; Institute for Quantum Information and Matter, an NSF Physics Frontiers Center; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation; Vienna Science and Technology Fund WWTF; European Commission through IP SIQS; European Commission through iQUOEMS; European Research Council; NSERC; European Commission through a Marie Curie Fellowship","We would like to thank K.

Milankovitch theory proposes that summer insolation at high northern latitudes drives the glacial cycles(3), and statistical tests have demonstrated that the glacial cycles are indeed linked to eccentricity, obliquity and precession cycles(4,5). Yet insolation alone cannot explain the strong 100,000-year cycle, suggesting that internal climatic feedbacks may also be at work(4-7). Earlier conceptual models, for example, showed that glacial terminations are associated with the build-up of Northern Hemisphere 'excess ice'(5,8-10), but the physical mechanisms underpinning the 100,000-year cycle remain unclear. Here we show, using comprehensive climate and ice-sheet models, that insolation and internal feedbacks between the climate, the ice sheets and the lithosphere-asthenosphere system explain the 100,000-year periodicity. The responses of equilibrium states of ice sheets to summer insolation show hysteresis(11-13), with the shape and position of the hysteresis loop playing a key part in determining the periodicities of glacial cycles. The hysteresis loop of the North American ice sheet is such that after inception of the ice sheet, its mass balance remains mostly positive through several precession cycles, whose amplitudes decrease towards an eccentricity minimum. The larger the ice sheet grows and extends towards lower latitudes, the smaller is the insolation required to make the mass balance negative. Therefore, once a large ice sheet is established, a moderate increase in insolation is sufficient to trigger a negative mass balance, leading to an almost complete retreat of the ice sheet within several thousand years. This fast retreat is governed mainly by rapid ablation due to the lowered surface elevation resulting from delayed isostatic rebound(14-16), which is the lithosphere-asthenosphere response. Carbon dioxide is involved, but is not determinative, in the evolution of the 100,000-year glacial cycles.","[Abe-Ouchi, Ayako; Okuno, Jun'ichi; Blatter, Heinz] Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778568, Japan; [Abe-Ouchi, Ayako; Saito, Fuyuki; Okuno, Jun'ichi; Takahashi, Kunio] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Res Inst Global Change, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan; [Abe-Ouchi, Ayako; Kawamura, Kenji; Okuno, Jun'ichi] Natl Inst Polar Res, Tachikawa, Tokyo 1908518, Japan; [Kawamura, Kenji] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Inst Biogeosci, Yokosuka, Kanagawa 2370061, Japan; [Raymo, Maureen E.] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Blatter, Heinz] ETH, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland","Abe-Ouchi, A (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778568, Japan.",abeouchi@aori.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Abe-Ouchi, Ayako/M-6359-2013","Abe-Ouchi, Ayako/0000-0003-1745-5952; Kawamura, Kenji/0000-0003-1163-700X; SAITO, Fuyuki/0000-0001-5935-9614","JSPS KAKENHI [25241005, 22101005, 21671001]; MEXT, Japan; Ministry of the Environment, Japan [S-10]","Discussions with numerous people including M.

In such environments, microbial metabolism is limited by the diffusive supply of electron acceptors. One strategy to optimize energy yields in a resource-limited habitat is symbiotic metabolite exchange among microbial associations(1,2). Thermodynamic and geochemical considerations indicate that microbial cometabolisms are likely to play a critical part in sedimentary organic carbon cycling(3-5). Yet only one association, between methanotrophic archaea and sulphate-reducing bacteria, has been demonstrated in marine sedimentsin situ(6,7), and little is known of the role of microbial symbiotic interactions in other sedimentary biogeochemical cycles(8). Here we report in situ molecular and incubation-based evidence for a novel symbiotic consortium between two chemolithotrophic bacteria-anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing (anammox) bacteria and the nitrate-sequestering sulphur-oxidizing Thioploca species-in anoxic sediments of the Soledad basin at the Mexican Pacific margin. A mass balance of benthic solute fluxes and the corresponding nitrogen isotope composition of nitrate and ammonium fluxes indicate that anammox bacteria rely on Thioploca species for the supply of metabolic substrates and account for about 57 +/- 21 per cent of the total benthic N-2 production. We show that Thioploca-anammox symbiosis intensifies benthic fixed nitrogen losses in anoxic sediments, bypassing diffusion-imposed limitations by efficiently coupling the carbon, nitrogen and sulphur cycles.","[Prokopenko, M.

It has a novel dentition, a mandible resembling advanced multituberculates and postcranial features adapted for arboreal life. Our phylogenetic analysis places Haramiyida within crown Mammalia, suggesting the origin of crown Mammalia in the Late Triassic period and diversification in the Jurassic, which contrasts other estimated divergence times of crown Mammalia(6-8). The new haramiyid reveals additional mammalian features of the group, helps to identify other haramiyids represented by isolated teeth, and shows again that, regardless of various phylogenetic scenarios, a complex pattern of evolution involving many convergences and/or reversals existed in Mesozoic mammals.

Examples include feathers, which originated before they were used in flight(2), and lens crystallins, which are light-refracting proteins that originated as enzymes(6). The question of how often adaptive traits have non-adaptive origins has profound implications for evolutionary biology, but is difficult to address systematically. Here we consider this issue in metabolism, one of the most ancient biological systems that is central to all life. We analyse a metabolic trait of great adaptive importance: the ability of a metabolic reaction network to synthesize all biomass from a single source of carbon and energy. We use novel computational methods to sample randomly many metabolic networks that can sustain life on any given carbon source but contain an otherwise random set of known biochemical reactions. We show that when we require such networks to be viable on one particular carbon source, they are typically also viable on multiple other carbon sources that were not targets of selection. For example, viability on glucose may entail viability on up to 44 other sole carbon sources. Any one adaptation in these metabolic systems typically entails multiple potential exaptations. Metabolic systems thus contain a latent potential for evolutionary innovations with non-adaptive origins. Our observations suggest that many more metabolic traits may have non-adaptive origins than is appreciated at present. They also challenge our ability to distinguish adaptive from non-adaptive traits.","[Barve, Aditya; Wagner, Andreas] Univ Zurich, Inst Evolutionary Biol & Environm Sci, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Barve, Aditya; Wagner, Andreas] Swiss Inst Bioinformat, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Wagner, Andreas] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA","Wagner, A (reprint author), Univ Zurich, Inst Evolutionary Biol & Environm Sci, Bldg Y27,Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",andreas.wagner@ieu.uzh.ch,,,Swiss National Science Foundation [315230-129708],"We thank K.

This was the first successful attempt to immortalize human-derived cells in vitro(1). The robust growth and unrestricted distribution of HeLa cells resulted in its broad adoption-both intentionally and through widespread cross-contamination(2)-and for the past 60 years it has served a role analogous to that of a model organism(3). The cumulative impact of the HeLa cell line on research is demonstrated by its occurrence in more than 74,000 PubMed abstracts (approximately 0.3%). The genomic architecture of HeLa remains largely unexplored beyond its karyotype(4), partly because like many cancers, its extensive aneuploidy renders such analyses challenging. We carried out haplotype-resolved whole-genome sequencing(5) of the HeLa CCL-2 strain, examined point-and indel-mutation variations, mapped copy-number variations and loss of heterozygosity regions, and phased variants across full chromosome arms. We also investigated variation and copy-number profiles for HeLa S3 and eight additional strains. We find that HeLa is relatively stable in terms of point variation, with few new mutations accumulating after early passaging. Haplotype resolution facilitated reconstruction of an amplified, highly rearranged region of chromosome 8q24.21 at which integration of the human papilloma virus type 18 (HPV-18) genome occurred and that is likely to be the event that initiated tumorigenesis. We combined these maps with RNA-seq(6) and ENCODE Project(7) data sets to phase the HeLa epigenome. This revealed strong, haplotype-specific activation of the proto-oncogene MYC by the integrated HPV-18 genome approximately 500 kilobases upstream, and enabled global analyses of the relationship between gene dosage and expression. These data provide an extensively phased, high-quality reference genome for past and future experiments relying on HeLa, and demonstrate the value of haplotype resolution for characterizing cancer genomes and epigenomes.","[Adey, Andrew; Burton, Joshua N.; Kitzman, Jacob O.; Hiatt, Joseph B.; Lewis, Alexandra P.; Martin, Beth K.; Qiu, Ruolan; Lee, Choli; Shendure, Jay] Univ Washington, Dept Genome Sci, Seattle, WA 98115 USA","Shendure, J (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Genome Sci, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.",acadey@uw.edu; shendure@uw.edu,,"Burton, Joshua/0000-0003-2817-7353; Shendure, Jay/0000-0002-1516-1865",National Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) [HG006283]; National Cancer Institute [CA160080]; National Science Foundation [DGE-0718124]; NHGRI [T32HG000035]; National Institute of Aging [AG039173],"The genome sequence described in this paper was derived from a HeLa cell line.

In the fly optic lobe, two parallel processing streams have been anatomically described, leading from two first-order interneurons, L1 and L2, via T4 and T5 cells onto large, wide-field motion-sensitive interneurons of the lobula plate(1). Therefore, T4 and T5 cells are thought to have a pivotal role in motion processing; however, owing to their small size, it is difficult to obtain electrical recordings of T4 and T5 cells, leaving their visual response properties largely unknown. We circumvent this problem by means of optical recording from these cells in Drosophila, using the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP5 (ref. 2). Here we find that specific subpopulations of T4 and T5 cells are directionally tuned to one of the four cardinal directions; that is, front-to-back, back-to-front, upwards and downwards. Depending on their preferred direction, T4 and T5 cells terminate in specific sublayers of the lobula plate. T4 and T5 functionally segregate with respect to contrast polarity: whereas T4 cells selectively respond to moving brightness increments (ON edges), T5 cells only respond to moving brightness decrements (OFF edges). When the output from T4 or T5 cells is blocked, the responses of postsynaptic lobula plate neurons to moving ON (T4 block) or OFF edges (T5 block) are selectively compromised. The same effects are seen in turning responses of tethered walking flies. Thus, starting with L1 and L2, the visual input is split into separate ON and OFF pathways, and motion along all four cardinal directions is computed separately within each pathway. The output of these eight different motion detectors is then sorted such that ON (T4) and OFF (T5) motion detectors with the same directional tuning converge in the same layer of the lobula plate, jointly providing the input to downstream circuits and motion-driven behaviours.","[Maisak, Matthew S.; Haag, Juergen; Ammer, Georg; Serbe, Etienne; Meier, Matthias; Leonhardt, Aljoscha; Schilling, Tabea; Bahl, Armin; Reiff, Dierk F.; Hopp, Elisabeth; Borst, Alexander] Max Planck Inst Neurobiol, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany; [Rubin, Gerald M.; Nern, Aljoscha] Janelia Farm Res Campus, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA; [Dickson, Barry J.] Inst Mol Pathol, A-1030 Vienna, Austria","Borst, A (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Neurobiol, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany.",borst@neuro.mpg.de,"Marion-Poll, Frederic/D-8882-2011","Marion-Poll, Frederic/0000-0001-6824-0180; Rubin, Gerald/0000-0001-8762-8703",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB 870],"We thank L.

It is unclear how to develop these sensory epithelia from pluripotent stem cells, a process that will be critical for modelling inner ear disorders or developing cell-based therapies for profound hearing loss and balance disorders(1,2). So far, attempts to derive inner ear mechanosensitive hair cells and sensory neurons have resulted in inefficient or incomplete phenotypic conversion of stem cells into inner-ear-like cells(3-7). A key insight lacking from these previous studies is the importance of the nonneural and preplacodal ectoderm, two critical precursors during inner ear development(8-11). Here we report the stepwise differentiation of inner ear sensory epithelia from mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in three-dimensional culture(12,13). We show that by recapitulating in vivo development with precise temporal control of signalling pathways, ESC aggregates transform sequentially into non-neural, preplacodal and otic-placode-like epithelia. Notably, in a self-organized process that mimics normal development, vesicles containing prosensory cells emerge from the presumptive otic placodes and give rise to hair cells bearing stereocilia bundles and a kinocilium. Moreover, these stem-cell-derived hair cells exhibit functional properties of native mechanosensitive hair cells and form specialized synapses with sensory neurons that have also arisen from ESCs in the culture. Finally, we demonstrate how these vesicles are structurally and biochemically comparable to developing vestibular end organs. Our data thus establish a new in vitro model of inner ear differentiation that can be used to gain deeper insight into inner ear development and disorder.","[Koehler, Karl R.; Hashino, Eri] Indiana Univ Sch Med, Med Neurosci Grad Program, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Koehler, Karl R.; Mikosz, Andrew M.; Molosh, Andrei I.; Patel, Dharmeshkumar; Hashino, Eri] Indiana Univ Sch Med, Stark Neurosci Res Inst, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Koehler, Karl R.; Mikosz, Andrew M.; Patel, Dharmeshkumar; Hashino, Eri] Indiana Univ Sch Med, Dept Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Molosh, Andrei I.] Indiana Univ Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA","Hashino, E (reprint author), Indiana Univ Sch Med, Med Neurosci Grad Program, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA.",krkoehle@iupui.edu; ehashino@iupui.edu,,"Koehler, Karl/0000-0002-0685-538X","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [RC1DC010706, R21DC012617, R01GM086544]; Paul and Carole Stark Neurosciences Fellowship; Indiana Clinical and Translational Science Institute Predoctoral Fellowship [NIH TL1RR025759]; NIH [R01MH52619]","The authors would like to thank G.

Global DNA demethylation occurs in the early embryo and the germ line(2,3), and may be mediated by Tet (ten eleven translocation) enzymes(4-6), which convert 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC)(7). Tet enzymes have been studied extensively in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells(8-12), which are generally cultured in the absence of vitamin C, a potential cofactor for Fe(II) 2-oxoglutarate dioxygenase enzymes such as Tet enzymes. Here we report that addition of vitamin C to mouse ES cells promotes Tet activity, leading to a rapid and global increase in 5hmC. This is followed by DNA demethylation of many gene promoters and upregulation of demethylated germline genes. Tet1 binding is enriched near the transcription start site of genes affected by vitamin C treatment. Importantly, vitamin C, but not other antioxidants, enhances the activity of recombinant Tet1 in a biochemical assay, and the vitamin-C-induced changes in 5hmC and 5mC are entirely suppressed in Tet1 and Tet2 double knockout ES cells. Vitamin C has a stronger effect on regions that gain methylation in cultured ES cells compared to blastocysts, and in vivo are methylated only after implantation. In contrast, imprinted regions and intracisternal A particle retroelements, which are resistant to demethylation in the early embryo(2,13), are resistant to vitamin-C-induced DNA demethylation. Collectively, the results of this study establish vitamin C as a direct regulator of Tet activity and DNA methylation fidelity in ES cells.","[Blaschke, Kathryn; Ebata, Kevin T.; Laird, Diana J.; Ramalho-Santos, Miguel] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Eli & Edythe Broad Ctr Regenerat Med & Stem Cell, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Blaschke, Kathryn; Ebata, Kevin T.; Laird, Diana J.; Ramalho-Santos, Miguel] Univ Calif San Francisco, Ctr Reprod Sci, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Karimi, Mohammad M.; Goyal, Preeti; Lorincz, Matthew C.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Med Genet, Inst Life Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada; [Karimi, Mohammad M.; Tam, Angela; Hirst, Martin] British Columbia Canc Agcy, Canadas Michael Smith Genome Sci Ctr, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada; [Zepeda-Martinez, Jorge A.; Mahapatra, Sahasransu; Rao, Anjana] La Jolla Inst Allergy & Immunol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Zepeda-Martinez, Jorge A.; Mahapatra, Sahasransu; Rao, Anjana] Sanford Consortium Regenerat Med, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Hirst, Martin] Univ British Columbia, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Inst Life Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada","Lorincz, MC (reprint author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Med Genet, Inst Life Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada.",mlorincz@mail.ubc.ca; mrsantos@diabetes.ucsf.edu,"Tang, Macy/B-9798-2014; Hirst, Martin/B-7684-2016","Karimi, Mohammad Mahdi/0000-0001-5017-1252","NSF; California Institute of Regenerative Medicine postdoctoral training grant [TG2-01153]; Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research; CIHR [92093]; NIH [HD065812, CA151535, DP2OD004698, OD012204]; California Institute of Regenerative Medicine","The authors wish to acknowledge the epigenomics and sequencing groups at the Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre, Canada, for performing 5mC DIP and 5hmC DIP Illumina sequencing, as well as for technical support.

CD26 (also known as dipeptidyl peptidase 4, DPP4) was recently identified as the cellular receptor for MERS-CoV4. The engagement of the MERS-CoV spike protein with CD26 mediates viral attachment to host cells and virus-cell fusion, thereby initiating infection. Here we delineate the molecular basis of this specific interaction by presenting the first crystal structures of both the free receptor binding domain (RBD) of the MERS-CoV spike protein and its complex with CD26. Furthermore, binding between the RBD and CD26 is measured using real-time surface plasmon resonance with a dissociation constant of 16.7 nM. The viral RBD is composed of a core subdomain homologous to that of the SARS-CoV spike protein, and a unique strand-dominated external receptor binding motif that recognizes blades IV and V of the CD26 beta-propeller. The atomic details at the interface between the two binding entities reveal a surprising protein-protein contact mediated mainly by hydrophilic residues. Sequence alignment indicates, among beta-coronaviruses, a possible structural conservation for the region homologous to the MERS-CoV RBD core, but a high variation in the external receptor binding motif region for virus-specific pathogenesis such as receptor recognition.","[Lu, Guangwen; Wang, Qihui; Qi, Jianxun; Li, Yan; Zhang, Yanfang; Zhang, Wei; Yuan, Yuan; Yan, Jinghua; Gao, George F.] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Microbiol, CAS Key Lab Pathogen Microbiol & Immunol, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Hu, Yawei; Zhang, Buchang] Anhui Univ, Sch Life Sci, Hefei 230039, Peoples R China; [Gao, Feng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Biophys, Lab Noncoding RNA, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Gao, Feng; Bao, Jinku] Sichuan Univ, Sch Life Sci, Chengdu 610064, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yanfang; Gao, George F.] Tianjin Inst Ind Biotechnol, Lab Prot Engn & Vaccines, Tianjin 300308, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Yuan; Gao, George F.] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Life Sci, Hefei 230026, Peoples R China; [Shi, Yi; Gao, George F.] Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing Inst Life Sci, RNIH, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Gao, George F.] Chinese Ctr Dis Control & Prevent China CDC, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China","Gao, GF (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Microbiol, CAS Key Lab Pathogen Microbiol & Immunol, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",gaof@im.ac.cn,,,Ministry of Science and Technology of China (MOST) [2011CB504703]; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [81290342]; NSFC Innovative Research Group [81021003],"This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (MOST) 973 Project (Grant no. 2011CB504703) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC, Grant no. 81290342).

Here we use a rational approach to isolate CD4(+)FOXP3(+) regulatory T (T-reg)-cell-inducing bacterial strains from the human indigenous microbiota. Starting with a healthy human faecal sample, a sequence of selection steps was applied to obtain mice colonized with human microbiota enriched in T-reg-cell-inducing species. From these mice, we isolated and selected 17 strains of bacteria on the basis of their high potency in enhancing T-reg cell abundance and inducing important anti-inflammatory molecules-including interleukin-10 (IL-10) and inducible T-cell co-stimulator (ICOS)-in T-reg cells upon inoculation into germ-free mice. Genome sequencing revealed that the 17 strains fall within clusters IV, XIVa and XVIII of Clostridia, which lack prominent toxins and virulence factors. The 17 strains act as a community to provide bacterial antigens and a TGF-beta-rich environment to help expansion and differentiation of T-reg cells. Oral administration of the combination of 17 strains to adult mice attenuated disease in models of colitis and allergic diarrhoea. Use of the isolated strains may allow for tailored therapeutic manipulation of human immune disorders.","[Atarashi, Koji; Tanoue, Takeshi; Nagano, Yuji; Fukuda, Shinji; Narushima, Seiko; Hase, Koji; Ohno, Hiroshi; Honda, Kenya] RIKEN Ctr Integrat Med Sci IMS RCAI, Tsurumi Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Atarashi, Koji; Tanoue, Takeshi; Nagano, Yuji; Taniguchi, Tadatsugu; Honda, Kenya] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Med, Dept Immunol, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Atarashi, Koji; Hase, Koji] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, PRESTO, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; [Oshima, Kenshiro; Morita, Hidetoshi; Honda, Kenya] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, CREST, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; [Oshima, Kenshiro; Suda, Wataru; Kim, Sangwan; Hattori, Masahira] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778561, Japan; [Nishikawa, Hiroyoshi; Saito, Takuro; Sakaguchi, Shimon] Osaka Univ, Immunol Frontier Res Ctr, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Fukuda, Shinji] Keio Univ, Inst Adv Biosci, Tsuruoka, Yamagata 9970052, Japan; [Fritz, Joelle V.; Wilmes, Paul] Univ Luxembourg, Luxembourg Ctr Syst Biomed, L-4362 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg; [Ueha, Satoshi; Matsushima, Kouji] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Med, Dept Mol Prevent Med, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Olle, Bernat] PureTech Ventures, Boston, MA 02116 USA; [Morita, Hidetoshi] Azabu Univ, Sch Vet Med, Sagamihara, Kanagawa 2525201, Japan","Hattori, M (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, 5-1-5 Kashiwanoha, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778561, Japan.",hattori@k.u-tokyo.ac.jp; kenya@rcai.riken.jp,"Sakaguchi, Shimon/C-9535-2009; Ohno, Hiroshi/L-7899-2014; Hattori, Masahira/C-6958-2016; Honda, Kenya/N-5297-2015; Atarashi, Koji/I-5363-2014; Wilmes, Paul/B-1707-2017","Ohno, Hiroshi/0000-0001-8776-9661; Hattori, Masahira/0000-0001-9467-0344; Wilmes, Paul/0000-0002-6478-2924","JSPS NEXT program; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan [221S0002]; global COE project of 'Genome Information Big Bang'; Waksman Foundation of Japan Inc.","This work was supported by JSPS NEXT program, Grant in Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas 'Genome Science' from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan (No.221S0002), the global COE project of 'Genome Information Big Bang' and the Waksman Foundation of Japan Inc.

The process is regulated to facilitate efficient nutrient use and metabolic homeostasis. Feedback inhibition of the first committed step of a pathway by its final product is a classical means of controlling biosynthesis(1-4). In a canonical example, the first committed enzyme in the pyrimidine pathway in Escherichia coli is allosterically inhibited by cytidine triphosphate(1,4,5). The physiological consequences of disrupting this regulation, however, have not been previously explored. Here we identify an alternative regulatory strategy that enables precise control of pyrimidine pathway end-product levels, even in the presence of dysregulated biosynthetic flux. The mechanism involves cooperative feedback regulation of the near-terminal pathway enzyme uridine monophosphate kinase(6). Such feedback leads to build-up of the pathway intermediate uridine monophosphate, which is in turn degraded by a conserved phosphatase, here termed UmpH, with previously unknown physiological function(7,8). Such directed overflow metabolism allows homeostasis of uridine triphosphate and cytidine triphosphate levels at the expense of uracil excretion and slower growth during energy limitation.

We have established a method for inducing functional genetic mosaics in the mouse. Using this system, here we show that induction of a mosaic imbalance of Myc expression in the epiblast provokes the expansion of cells with higher Myc levels through the apoptotic elimination of cells with lower levels, without disrupting development. In contrast, homogeneous shifts in Myc levels did not affect epiblast cell viability, indicating that the observed competition results from comparison of relative Myc levels between epiblast cells. During normal development we found that Myc levels are intrinsically heterogeneous among epiblast cells, and that endogenous cell competition refines the epiblast cell population through the elimination of cells with low relative Myc levels. These results show that natural cell competition in the early mammalian embryo contributes to the selection of the epiblast cell pool.","[Claveria, Cristina; Giovinazzo, Giovanna; Sierra, Rocio; Torres, Miguel] CNIC, Dept Desarrollo & Reparac Cardiovasc, E-28029 Madrid, Spain","Torres, M (reprint author), CNIC, Dept Desarrollo & Reparac Cardiovasc, E-28029 Madrid, Spain.",mtorres@cnic.es,"Torres, Miguel/A-7388-2013; Giovinazzo, Giovanna/I-1283-2015","Torres, Miguel/0000-0003-0906-4767; Giovinazzo, Giovanna/0000-0002-5391-0441","Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (MINECO); Pro-CNIC Foundation; MINECO/ISCIII TerCel [RD06/0010/0008]; Human Frontiers Science Program [RGP0008/2004]; Madrid Regional Government [S-SAL-0190-2006, P2010/BMD-2315]","We thank S.

Age differences between these clusters can indicate the sequence in which the components of the Galaxy formed, and in particular which clusters were formed outside the Galaxy and were later engulfed along with their original host galaxies, and which were formed within it. Here we report an absolute age of 9.9 +/- 0.7 billion years (at 95 per cent confidence) for the metal-rich globular cluster 47 Tucanae, determined by modelling the properties of the cluster's white-dwarf cooling sequence. This is about two billion years younger than has been inferred for the metal-poor cluster NGC 6397 from the same models, and provides quantitative evidence that metal-rich clusters like 47 Tucanae formed later than metal-poor halo clusters like NGC 6397.","[Hansen, B.

In particular, a thermometer capable of subdegree temperature resolution over a large range of temperatures as well as integration within a living system could provide a powerful new tool in many areas of biological, physical and chemical research. Possibilities range from the temperature-induced control of gene expression(2-5) and tumour metabolism(6) to the cell-selective treatment of disease(7,8) and the study of heat dissipation in integrated circuits(1). By combining local light-induced heat sources with sensitive nanoscale thermometry, it may also be possible to engineer biological processes at the subcellular level(2-5). Here we demonstrate a new approach to nanoscale thermometry that uses coherent manipulation of the electronic spin associated with nitrogen-vacancy colour centres in diamond. Our technique makes it possible to detect temperature variations as small as 1.8 mK (a sensitivity of 9 mK Hz(-1/2)) in an ultrapure bulk diamond sample. Using nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond nanocrystals (nanodiamonds), we directly measure the local thermal environment on length scales as short as 200 nanometres. Finally, by introducing both nanodiamonds and gold nanoparticles into a single human embryonic fibroblast, we demonstrate temperature-gradient control and mapping at the subcellular level, enabling unique potential applications in life sciences.","[Kucsko, G.; Maurer, P.

Flexible electronics, neuroprosthetic and cardiostimulating implants, soft robotics and other curvilinear systems require materials with high conductivity over a tensile strain of 100 per cent (refs 1-3). Furthermore, implantable devices or stretchable displays(4) need materials with conductivities a thousand times higher while retaining a strain of 100 per cent. However, the molecular mechanisms that operate during material deformation and stiffening make stretchability and conductivity fundamentally difficult properties to combine. The macroscale stretching of solids elongates chemical bonds, leading to the reduced overlap and delocalization of electronic orbitals(5). This conductivity-stretchability dilemma can be exemplified by liquid metals, in which conduction pathways are retained on large deformation but weak interatomic bonds lead to compromised strength. The best-known stretchable conductors use polymer matrices containing percolated networks of high-aspect-ratio nanometre-scale tubes or nanowires to address this dilemma to some extent(6-11). Further improvements have been achieved by using fillers (the conductive component) with increased aspect ratio, of all-metallic composition(12), or with specific alignment (the way the fillers are arranged in the matrix)(13,14). However, the synthesis and separation of high-aspect-ratio fillers is challenging, stiffness increases with the volume content of metallic filler, and anisotropy increases with alignment(15). Pre-strained substrates(16,17), buckled microwires(18) and three-dimensional microfluidic polymer networks(19) have also been explored. Here we demonstrate stretchable conductors of polyurethane containing spherical nanoparticles deposited by either layer-by-layer assembly or vacuum-assisted flocculation. High conductivity and stretchability were observed in both composites despite the minimal aspect ratio of the nanoparticles. These materials also demonstrate the electronic tunability of mechanical properties, which arise from the dynamic self-organization of the nanoparticles under stress. A modified percolation theory incorporating the self-assembly behaviour of nanoparticles gave an excellent match with the experimental data.","[Kim, Yoonseob; Zhu, Jian; Yeom, Bongjun; Di Prima, Matthew; Kotov, Nicholas A.] Univ Michigan, Dept Chem Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Su, Xianli; Uher, Ctirad] Univ Michigan, Dept Phys, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Kim, Jin-Gyu; Yoo, Seung Jo] Korea Basic Sci Inst KBSI, Div Electron Microscop Res, Taejon 305806, South Korea","Kotov, NA (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Dept Chem Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",kotov@umich.edu,"Su, Xianli/A-9685-2012; Zhu, Jian/D-4122-2012; Zhu, Jian/H-6443-2015","Zhu, Jian/0000-0002-7004-0257; Di Prima, Matthew/0000-0003-1623-1324; Yeom, Bongjun/0000-0001-8914-0947; Kotov, Nicholas/0000-0002-6864-5804","STX foundation, Seoul, Korea; Center for Solar and Thermal Energy Conversion, an Energy Frontier Research Center (EFRC); US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-SC0000957]; Center for Photonic and Multiscale Nanomaterials (C-PHOM) as a part of the National Science Foundation Materials Research Science and Engineering Center [DMR 1120923]; AFOSR [FA9550-08-1-0382]; Game Changer programme; NSF [DMR-0320740, DMR-9871177]","We thank the STX foundation, Seoul, Korea, for partial funding of this research by providing a stipend to Y.K.

Yet many models demonstrate large, systematic biases in simulated SST in the equatorial 'cold tongues' (expansive regions of net heat uptake from the atmosphere) of the Atlantic(2) and Pacific(3) oceans, particularly with regard to a central but little-understood feature of tropical oceans: a strong seasonal cycle. The biases may be related to the inability of models to constrain turbulent mixing realistically(4), given that turbulent mixing, combined with seasonal variations in atmospheric heating, determines SST. In temperate oceans, the seasonal SST cycle is clearly related to varying solar heating(5); in the tropics, however, SSTs vary seasonally in the absence of similar variations in solar inputs(6). Turbulent mixing has long been a likely explanation, but firm, long-term observational evidence has been absent. Here we show the existence of a distinctive seasonal cycle of subsurface cooling via mixing in the equatorial Pacific cold tongue, using multi-year measurements of turbulence in the ocean. In boreal spring, SST rises by 2 kelvin when heating of the upper ocean by the atmosphere exceeds cooling by mixing from below. In boreal summer, SST decreases because cooling from below exceeds heating from above. When the effects of lateral advection are considered, the magnitude of summer cooling via mixing (4 kelvin per month) is equivalent to that required to counter the heating terms. These results provide quantitative assessment of how mixing varies on timescales longer than a few weeks, clearly showing its controlling influence on seasonal cooling of SST in a critical oceanic regime.","[Moum, James N.; Perlin, Alexander; Nash, Jonathan D.] Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [McPhaden, Michael J.] NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, Seattle, WA 98115 USA","Moum, JN (reprint author), Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",moum@coas.oregonstate.edu,"Moum, James/A-1880-2012; McPhaden, Michael/D-9799-2016",,"National Science Foundation [0424133, 0728375, 1256620]","This work was funded by the National Science Foundation (grants 0424133, 0728375 and 1256620).

Geophysical techniques are also not very effective in the lower and middle crust, where seismic events are rare and resolution is generally poor(4,5). It has thus been unclear how fast mantle-derived magmas transit the crust and recharge crustal magma chambers. Here we use diffusion modelling of nickel zonation profiles in primitive olivines from diverse primary melts(6-10) to show how mantle recharge may occur on timescales as short as eruptions themselves. In Irazu volcano in Costa Rica, magmas apparently ascend from their source region in the mantle through crust about 35 kilometres thick in just months to years, recharging hybrid basaltic andesites over the course of the eruption. These results show that large stratovolcanoes with shallow magma chambers(11,12) may still preserve the deep record of their mantle origin in olivine crystals. This approach-documenting magma ascent timescales from the mantle beneath a convergent margin stratovolcano-can be applied to other eruptions that record magma mixing with recharge melts. Signs of volcanic unrest are typically monitored at the surface or upper crust; new efforts should look deeper, tracking magma movement from the base of the crust to the surface in the months to years before eruptions.","[Ruprecht, Philipp; Plank, Terry] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA","Ruprecht, P (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, 61 Route 9W, Palisades, NY 10964 USA.",ruprecht@ldeo.columbia.edu,"Ruprecht, Philipp/I-3135-2013; Plank, Terry/D-9542-2012","Ruprecht, Philipp/0000-0003-0429-3499; ",Alexander-von-Humboldt foundation; NSF [EAR0948533],We thank G.

About a century ago, Thomas Hunt Morgan attempted to explain the extraordinary regenerative ability of planarians by positing two opposing morphogenetic gradients of formative ""head stuff"" and ""tail stuff"" along the anterior-posterior axis(3,4). However, Morgan's hypothesis remains open to debate. Here we show that extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) and Wnt/beta-catenin signalling pathways establish a solid framework for planarian regeneration. Our data suggest that ERK signalling forms a spatial gradient in the anterior region during regeneration. The fibroblast growth factor receptor-like gene nou-darake(5) (which serves as an output of ERK signalling in the differentiating head) and posteriorly biased beta-catenin activity(6-8) negatively regulate ERK signalling along the anterior-posterior axis in distinct manners, and thereby posteriorize regenerating tissues outside the head region to reconstruct a complete head-to-tail axis. On the basis of this knowledge about D. japonica, we proposed that beta-catenin signalling is responsible for the lack of head-regenerative ability of tail fragments in the planarian Phagocata kawakatsui, and our confirmation thereof supports the notion that posterior beta-catenin signalling negatively modulates the ERK signalling involved in anteriorization across planarian species. These findings suggest that ERK signalling has a pivotal role in triggering globally dynamic differentiation of stem cells in a head-to-tail sequence through a default program that promotes head tissue specification in the absence of posteriorizing signals. Thus, we have confirmed the broad outline of Morgan's hypothesis, and refined it on the basis of our proposed default property of planarian stem cells.","[Umesono, Yoshihiko] RIKEN Ctr Dev Biol, Chuo Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan; [Umesono, Yoshihiko; Tasaki, Junichi; Nishimura, Yui; Hrouda, Martina; Kawaguchi, Eri; Yazawa, Shigenobu; Nishimura, Osamu; Hosoda, Kazutaka; Inoue, Takeshi; Agata, Kiyokazu] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biophys, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan","Umesono, Y (reprint author), Univ Tokushima, Inst Technol & Sci, Dept Life Syst, 2-1 Minami Jyosanjima Cho, Tokushima 7708506, Japan.",umesono.yoshihiko@tokushima-u.ac.jp,"Yazawa, Shigenobu/E-6395-2014","Yazawa, Shigenobu/0000-0003-4539-3875; Inoue, Takeshi/0000-0003-3289-4478; Agata, Kiyokazu/0000-0002-5195-2576",Naito Foundation; Sasakawa Scientific Research Grant; JSPS; Kyoto University;  [22124004];  [22124001];  [17GS0318],"We thank C.

On the basis of their exceptional regenerative abilities, planarians have become important models for understanding the molecular basis of regeneration(2). However, planarian species with limited regenerative abilities are also found(3,4). Despite the importance of understanding the differences between closely related, regenerating and non-regenerating organisms, few studies have focused on the evolutionary loss of regeneration(5), and the molecular mechanisms leading to such regenerative loss remain obscure. Here we examine Procotyla fluviatilis, a planarian with restricted ability to replace missing tissues(6), using next-generation sequencing to define the gene expression programs active in regeneration-permissive and regeneration-deficient tissues. We found that Wnt signalling is aberrantly activated in regeneration-deficient tissues. Notably, downregulation of canonical Wnt signalling in regeneration-deficient regions restores regenerative abilities: blastemas form and new heads regenerate in tissues that normally never regenerate. This work reveals that manipulating a single signalling pathway can reverse the evolutionary loss of regenerative potential.","[Sikes, James M.; Newmark, Phillip A.] Univ Illinois, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Sikes, James M.; Newmark, Phillip A.] Univ Illinois, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Sikes, JM (reprint author), Univ San Francisco, Dept Biol, San Francisco, CA 94117 USA.",jsikes@usfca.edu,,"Newmark, Phillip/0000-0003-0793-022X",National Institute of General Medicine Sciences [F32GM097921],"We thank Newmark laboratory members for comments, A.

Why in the face of 'survival of the fittest' some animals regenerate but others do not remains a fascinating question(3). Planarian flatworms are well known and studied for their ability to regenerate from minute tissue pieces, yet species with limited regeneration abilities have been described even amongst planarians(4). Here we report the characterization of the regeneration defect in the planarian Dendrocoelum lacteum and its successful rescue. Tissue fragments cut from the posterior half of the body of this species are unable to regenerate a head and ultimately die(5). We find that this defect originates during the early stages of head specification, which require inhibition of canonical Wnt signalling in other planarian species(6-8). Notably, RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of Dlac-beta-catenin-1, the Wnt signal transducer, restored the regeneration of fully functional heads on tail pieces, rescuing D. lacteum's regeneration defect. Our results demonstrate the utility of comparative studies towards the reactivation of regenerative abilities in regeneration-deficient animals. Furthermore, the availability of D. lacteum as a regeneration-impaired planarian model species provides a first step towards elucidating the evolutionary mechanisms that ultimately determine why some animals regenerate and others do not.","[Liu, S. -Y.; Vila-Farre, M.; Brandl, H.; Lakshmanaperumal, N.; Henry, I.; Rink, J.

The executive elements of locomotor control are networks of spinal neurons that determine gait pattern through the sequential activation of motor-neuron pools on either side of the body axis(1-4). However, little is known about the constraints that link left-right coordination to locomotor speed. Recent advances have indicated that both excitatory and inhibitory commissural neurons may be involved in left-right coordination(5-7). But the neural underpinnings of this, and a possible causal link between these different groups of commissural neurons and left-right alternation, are lacking. Here we show, using intersectional mouse genetics, that ablation of a group of transcriptionally defined commissural neurons-the V0 population-leads to a quadrupedal hopping at all frequencies of locomotion. The selective ablation of inhibitory V0 neurons leads to a lack of left-right pattern at low frequencies, mixed coordination at medium frequencies, and alternation at high locomotor frequencies. When ablation is targeted to excitatory V0 neurons, left-right alternation is present at low frequencies, and hopping is restricted to medium and high locomotor frequencies. Therefore, the intrinsic logic of the central control of locomotion incorporates a modular organization, with two subgroups of V0 neurons required for the existence of left-right alternating modes at different speeds of locomotion. The two molecularly distinct sets of commissural neurons may constrain species-related naturally occurring frequency-dependent coordination and be involved in the evolution of different gaits.","[Talpalar, Adolfo E.; Bouvier, Julien; Borgius, Lotta; Kiehn, Ole] Karolinska Inst, Dept Neurosci, Mammalian Locomotor Lab, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Fortin, Gilles] CNRS, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Pierani, Alessandra] Univ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Inst Jacques Monod, CNRS,UMR 7592, F-75205 Paris, France","Kiehn, O (reprint author), Karolinska Inst, Dept Neurosci, Mammalian Locomotor Lab, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden.",ole.kiehn@ki.se,"Bouvier, Julien/C-1018-2017; Pierani, Alessandra/O-6136-2017","Bouvier, Julien/0000-0002-1307-4426; Pierani, Alessandra/0000-0002-4872-4791; Talpalar, Adolfo/0000-0001-9056-6021; Fortin, Gilles/0000-0002-2123-8603",Soderberg Foundation; Swedish Research Council; European Research Council,"This work was supported by the Soderberg Foundation, Swedish Research Council and European Research Council.

In germinal-centre B cells, AID is highly expressed, and has an inherent mutator activity that helps generate antibody diversity(2). However, AID may also regulate gene expression epigenetically by directly deaminating 5-methylcytosine in concert with base-excision repair to exchange cytosine(3). This pathway promotes gene demethylation, thereby removing epigenetic memory. For example, AID promotes active demethylation of the genome in primordial germ cells(4). However, different studies have suggested either a requirement(5) or a lack of function(6) for AID in promoting pluripotency in somatic nuclei after fusion with embryonic stem cells. Here we tested directly whether AID regulates epigenetic memory by comparing the relative ability of cells lacking AID to reprogram from a differentiated murine cell type to an induced pluripotent stem cell. We show that Aid-null cells are transiently hyper-responsive to the reprogramming process. Although they initiate expression of pluripotency genes, they fail to stabilize in the pluripotent state. The genome of Aid-null cells remains hypermethylated in reprogramming cells, and hypermethylated genes associated with pluripotency fail to be stably upregulated, including many MYC target genes. Recent studies identified a late step of reprogramming associated with methylation status(7), and implicated a secondary set of pluripotency network components(8). AID regulates this late step, removing epigenetic memory to stabilize the pluripotent state.","[Kumar, Ritu; Liu, Ting-Chun; Franck, Philipp; Evans, Todd] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Surg, New York, NY 10065 USA; [DiMenna, Lauren; Chaudhuri, Jayanta] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Sloan Kettering Inst, Immunol Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Schrode, Nadine; Munoz-Descalzo, Silvia; Hadjantonakis, Anna-Katerina] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Sloan Kettering Inst, Dev Biol Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Zarrin, Ali A.] Genentech Inc, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Elemento, Olivier] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Inst Computat Biomed, New York, NY 10065 USA","Evans, T (reprint author), Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Surg, New York, NY 10065 USA.",tre2003@med.cornell.edu,"Munoz-Descalzo, Silvia/M-8094-2013; Munoz-Descalzo, Silvia/A-3433-2011","Munoz-Descalzo, Silvia/0000-0003-0939-7721; Munoz-Descalzo, Silvia/0000-0003-0939-7721; Hadjantonakis, Anna-Katerina/0000-0002-7580-5124","National Institutes of Health [HL056182, AI072194]; National Science Foundation CAREER [1054964]","We thank G.

AML1-ETO, a fusion protein generated by the t(8;21) translocation in acute myeloid leukaemia, is a transcription factor implicated in both gene repression and activation(2). AML1-ETO oligomerization, mediated by the NHR2 domain, is critical for leukaemogenesis(3-6), making it important to identify co-regulatory factors that 'read' the NHR2 oligomerization and contribute to leukaemogenesis(4). Here we show that, in human leukaemic cells, AML1-ETO resides in and functions through a stable AML1-ETO-containing transcription factor complex (AETFC) that contains several haematopoietic transcription (co)factors. These AETFC components stabilize the complex through multivalent interactions, provide multiple DNA-binding domains for diverse target genes, co-localize genome wide, cooperatively regulate gene expression, and contribute to leukaemogenesis. Within the AETFC complex, AML1-ETO oligomerization is required for a specific interaction between the oligomerized NHR2 domain and a novel NHR2-binding (N2B) motif in E proteins. Crystallographic analysis of the NHR2-N2B complex reveals a unique interaction pattern in which an N2B peptide makes direct contact with side chains of two NHR2 domains as a dimer, providing a novel model of how dimeric/oligomeric transcription factors create a new protein-binding interface through dimerization/oligomerization. Intriguingly, disruption of this interaction by point mutations abrogates AML1-ETO-induced haematopoietic stem/progenitor cell self-renewal and leukaemogenesis. These results reveal new mechanisms of action of AML1-ETO, and provide a potential therapeutic target in t(8;21)-positive acute myeloid leukaemia.","[Sun, Xiao-Jian; Chen, Wei-Yi; Tang, Zhanyun; Nakadai, Tomoyoshi; Roeder, Robert G.] Rockefeller Univ, Lab Biochem & Mol Biol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Wang, Zhanxin; Patel, Dinshaw J.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Sloan Kettering Inst, Struct Biol Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Wang, Lan; Nimer, Stephen D.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Sloan Kettering Inst, Mol Pharmacol & Chem Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Wang, Lan; Nimer, Stephen D.] Univ Miami, Miller Sch Med, Sylvester Comprehens Canc Ctr, Miami, FL 33136 USA; [Jiang, Yanwen; Melnick, Ari] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Med, Div Hematol & Med Oncol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Kost, Nils; Fischle, Wolfgang] Max Planck Inst Biophys Chem, Lab Chromatin Biochem, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Soong, T.

Molecular chaperones are known to improve folding yields by suppressing aggregation between polypeptides before this conformational search starts(1,2), as well as by rescuing misfolds after it ends(1,3). Although chaperones have long been speculated to also affect the conformational search itself-by reshaping the underlying folding landscape along the folding trajectory(4,5)-direct experimental evidence has been scarce so far. In Escherichia coli, the general chaperone trigger factor(6-8) (TF) could play such a role. TF has been shown to interact with nascent chains at the ribosome(9,10), with polypeptides released from the ribosome into the cytosol(11), and with fully folded proteins before their assembly into larger complexes(12). To investigate the effect of TF from E. coli on the conformational search of polypeptides to their native state, we investigated individual maltose binding protein (MBP) molecules using optical tweezers. Here we show that TF binds folded structures smaller than one domain, which are then stable for seconds and ultimately convert to the native state. Moreover, TF stimulates native folding in constructs of repeated MBP domains. The results indicate that TF promotes correct folding by protecting partially folded states from distant interactions that produce stable misfolded states.

However, despite efforts to develop efflux inhibitors(3), clinically useful inhibitors are not available at present(4,5). Pyridopyrimidine derivatives are AcrB- and MexB-specific inhibitors that do not inhibit MexY(6,7); MexB and MexY are principal multidrug exporters in Pseudomonas aeruginosa(8-10). We have previously determined the crystal structure of AcrB in the absence and presence of antibiotics(11-13). Drugs were shown to be exported by a functionally rotating mechanism(12) through tandem proximal and distal multisite drug-binding pockets(13). Here we describe the first inhibitor-bound structures of AcrB and MexB, in which these proteins are bound by a pyridopyrimidine derivative. The pyridopyrimidine derivative binds tightly to a narrow pit composed of a phenylalanine cluster located in the distal pocket and sterically hinders the functional rotation. This pit is a hydrophobic trap that branches off from the substrate-translocation channel. Phe 178 is located at the edge of this trap in AcrB and MexB and contributes to the tight binding of the inhibitor molecule through a pi-pi interaction with the pyridopyrimidine ring. The voluminous side chain of Trp 177 located at the corresponding position in MexY prevents inhibitor binding. The structure of the hydrophobic trap described in this study will contribute to the development of universal inhibitors of MexB and MexY in P. aeruginosa.","[Nakashima, Ryosuke; Sakurai, Keisuke; Yamaguchi, Akihito] Osaka Univ, Inst Sci & Ind Res, Dept Cell Membrane Biol, Ibaraki, Osaka 5670047, Japan; [Yamasaki, Seiji; Hayashi, Katsuhiko; Yamaguchi, Akihito] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Nagata, Chikahiro; Hoshino, Kazuki; Onodera, Yoshikuni] Daiichi Sankyo Co Ltd, Edogawa Ku, Tokyo 1348630, Japan; [Nishino, Kunihiko] Osaka Univ, Inst Sci & Ind Res, Lab Microbiol & Infect Dis, Ibaraki, Osaka 5670047, Japan","Yamaguchi, A (reprint author), Osaka Univ, Inst Sci & Ind Res, Dept Cell Membrane Biol, Ibaraki, Osaka 5670047, Japan.",akihito@sanken.osaka-u.ac.jp,,"Hayashi, Katsuhiko/0000-0001-7359-5939","Academia Sinica; National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (Taiwan); CREST from the Japan Science and Technology Agency; Program for the Promotion of Fundamental Studies in Health Sciences of the National Institute of Biomedical Innovation; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan","We thank T.

Here we determined the crystal structure at 3.1 angstrom resolution of the 30S ribosomal subunit in complex with the anticodon stem loop of tRNA(Ser) bound to the Psi AG stop codon in the A site. The Psi A base pair at the first position is accompanied by the formation of purine-purine base pairs at the second and third positions of the codon, which show an unusual Watson-Crick/Hoogsteen geometry.

Their highly nonlinear and localized nature makes them very sensitive probes of the medium in which they propagate. Here we create long-lived solitons in a strongly interacting superfluid of fermionic atoms and directly observe their motion. As the interactions are tuned from the regime of Bose-Einstein condensation of tightly bound molecules towards the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer limit of long-range Cooper pairs, the solitons' effective mass increases markedly, to more than 200 times their bare mass, signalling strong quantum fluctuations. This mass enhancement is more than 50 times larger than the theoretically predicted value.

However, microbial genomes that are currently available are of limited phylogenetic breadth, owing to our historical inability to cultivate most microorganisms in the laboratory. We apply single-cell genomics to target and sequence 201 uncultivated archaeal and bacterial cells from nine diverse habitats belonging to 29 major mostly uncharted branches of the tree of life, so-called 'microbial dark matter'. With this additional genomic information, we are able to resolve many intra-and inter-phylum-level relationships and to propose two new superphyla. We uncover unexpected metabolic features that extend our understanding of biology and challenge established boundaries between the three domains of life. These include a novel amino acid use for the opal stop codon, an archaeal-type purine synthesis in Bacteria and complete sigma factors in Archaea similar to those in Bacteria. The single-cell genomes also served to phylogenetically anchor up to 20% of metagenomic reads in some habitats, facilitating organism-level interpretation of ecosystem function. This study greatly expands the genomic representation of the tree of life and provides a systematic step towards a better understanding of biological evolution on our planet.","[Rinke, Christian; Schwientek, Patrick; Sczyrba, Alexander; Ivanova, Natalia N.; Anderson, Iain J.; Cheng, Jan-Fang; Malfatti, Stephanie; Kyrpides, Nikos C.; Rubin, Edward M.; Woyke, Tanja] DOE Joint Genome Inst, Walnut Creek, CA 94598 USA; [Sczyrba, Alexander] Univ Bielefeld, Ctr Biotechnol, D-33602 Bielefeld, Germany; [Darling, Aaron; Eisen, Jonathan A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Evolut & Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Darling, Aaron] Univ Technol Sydney, Inst I3, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia; [Swan, Brandon K.; Stepanauskas, Ramunas] Bigelow Lab Ocean Sci, East Boothbay, ME 04544 USA; [Gies, Esther A.; Hallam, Steven J.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada; [Gies, Esther A.; Hallam, Steven J.] Univ British Columbia, Grad Program Bioinformat, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada; [Dodsworth, Jeremy A.; Hedlund, Brian P.] Univ Nevada, Sch Life Sci, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA; [Tsiamis, George] Univ Patras, Dept Environm & Nat Resources Management, Agrinion 30100, TK, Greece; [Sievert, Stefan M.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Biol, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Liu, Wen-Tso] Univ Illinois, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Urbana, IL 61802 USA; [Hugenholtz, Philip] Univ Queensland, Sch Chem & Mol Biosci, Australian Ctr Ecogenom, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Hugenholtz, Philip] Univ Queensland, Inst Mol Biosci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia","Hugenholtz, P (reprint author), Univ Queensland, Sch Chem & Mol Biosci, Australian Ctr Ecogenom, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.",p.hugenholtz@uq.edu.au; twoyke@lbl.gov,"Hugenholtz, Philip/G-9608-2011; Liu, Wen-Tso/C-8788-2011; Kyrpides, Nikos/A-6305-2014; Darling, Aaron/G-8119-2017","Hugenholtz, Philip/0000-0001-5386-7925; Liu, Wen-Tso/0000-0002-8700-9803; Kyrpides, Nikos/0000-0002-6131-0462; Rinke, Christian/0000-0003-4632-1187; Sievert, Stefan/0000-0002-9541-2707; Eisen, Jonathan A./0000-0002-0159-2197; Darling, Aaron/0000-0003-2397-7925; Ivanova, Natalia/0000-0002-5802-9485; Swan, Brandon/0000-0003-0465-1444; Stepanauskas, Ramunas/0000-0003-4458-3108; Sczyrba, Alexander/0000-0002-4405-3847","Office of Science of the US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; BMBF [031A190]; NASA [EXO-NNX11AR78G]; NSF [OISE 096842, OCE-0452333, OCE-1136727, DEB-841933, EF-826924, OCE-1232982, OCE-821374, OCE-1136488]; WHOI's Andrew W.

The stalk positions the extracellular domain (similar to 12 kilodaltons) relative to the membrane to form the glucagon-binding site that captures the peptide and facilitates the insertion of glucagon's amino terminus into the seven transmembrane domain.","[Siu, Fai Yiu; Han, Gye Won; Wacker, Daniel; Joseph, Jeremiah S.; Liu, Wei; Cherezov, Vadim; Katritch, Vsevolod; Stevens, Raymond C.] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Integrat Struct & Computat Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [He, Min; Yang, Dehua; Zhang, Zhiyun; Zhou, Caihong; Wang, Ming-Wei] Natl Ctr Drug Screening, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China; [He, Min; Yang, Dehua; Zhang, Zhiyun; Zhou, Caihong; Wang, Ming-Wei] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Mat Med, CAS Key Lab Receptor Res, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China; [de Graaf, Chris] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Mol Med & Syst AIMMS, Fac Sci, Div Med Chem, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Xu, Qingping] SLAC Natl Accelerator Lab, Joint Ctr Struct Genom, Stanford Synchrotron Radiat Lightsource, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Lau, Jesper] Novo Nordisk, Prot & Peptide Chem, DK-2760 Malov, Denmark","Wang, MW (reprint author), Natl Ctr Drug Screening, 189 Guo Shou Jing Rd, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China.",wangmw@mail.shcnc.ac.cn; stevens@scripps.edu,"Cherezov, Vadim/L-9812-2013; Katritch, Vsevolod/Q-8357-2016; Yang, Dehua/S-6156-2017","Cherezov, Vadim/0000-0002-5265-3914; Stevens, Raymond/0000-0002-4522-8725; Katritch, Vsevolod/0000-0003-3883-4505; de Graaf, Chris/0000-0002-1226-2150","NIH Road map [P50GM073197, U54 GM094618, U54 GM094586]; Ministry of Health [2012ZX09304-011, 2013ZX09507002]; Shanghai Science and Technology Development Fund [11DZ2292200]; Novo Nordisk-Chinese Academy of Sciences Research Fund [NNCAS-2011-7]; Thousand Talents Program in China; NIH [F32 DK088392]; Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) through a VENI [700.59.408]; COST Action [CM1207]; National Cancer Institute [Y1-CO-1020]; National Institute of General Medical Sciences [Y1-GM-1104]","This work was supported by NIH Road map grant P50GM073197 for technology development (V.

Although ionized galactic winds are readily observable, most of the expelled mass (that is, the total mass flowing out from the nuclear region) is likely to be in atomic(7,8) and molecular phases(9-11) that are cooler than the ionized phases. Expanding molecular shells observed in starburst systems such as NGC 253 (ref. 12) and M 82 (refs 13, 14) may facilitate the entrainment of molecular gas in the wind. Although shell properties are well constrained(12), determining the amount of outflowing gas emerging from such shells and the connection between this gas and the ionized wind requires spatial resolution better than 100 parsecs coupled with sensitivity to a wide range of spatial scales, a combination hitherto not available. Here we report observations of NGC 253, a nearby(15) starburst galaxy (distance similar to 3.4 megaparsecs) known to possess a wind(16-20), that trace the cool molecular wind at 50-parsec resolution. At this resolution, the extraplanar molecular gas closely tracks the Ha filaments, and it appears to be connected to expanding molecular shells located in the starburst region. These observations allow us to determine that the molecular outflow rate is greater than 3 solar masses per year and probably about 9 solar masses per year. This implies a ratio of mass-outflow rate to star-formation rate of at least 1, and probably similar to 3, indicating that the starburst-driven wind limits the star-formation activity and the final stellar content.","[Bolatto, Alberto D.; Warren, Steven R.; Veilleux, Sylvain; Fisher, David B.] Univ Maryland, Dept Astron, Lab Millimeter Wave Astron, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Bolatto, Alberto D.; Warren, Steven R.; Veilleux, Sylvain; Fisher, David B.] Univ Maryland, Joint Space Inst, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Leroy, Adam K.] Natl Radio Astron Observ, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Walter, Fabian; Hodge, Jacqueline] Max Planck Inst Astron, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Ostriker, Eve C.] Princeton Univ, Dept Astrophys Sci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Ott, Juergen] Natl Radio Astron Observ, Socorro, NM 87801 USA; [Zwaan, Martin] European So Observ, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Weiss, Axel] Max Planck Inst Radioastron, D-53121 Bonn, Germany; [Rosolowsky, Erik] Univ British Columbia, Dept Phys & Astron, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada","Bolatto, AD (reprint author), Univ Maryland, Dept Astron, Lab Millimeter Wave Astron, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",bolatto@astro.umd.edu,,,"CAREER [NSF-AST0955836, NSF-AST1139998]; Research Corporation for Science Advancement Cottrell Scholar award; NSF [AST-0908185];  [NSF-AST100958]","A.D.B. acknowledges partial support from a CAREER grant NSF-AST0955836, NSF-AST1139998 and from a Research Corporation for Science Advancement Cottrell Scholar award.

However, the interpreted ages of the ejected igneous crust of Mars differ by up to four billion years(1-6), a conundrum(7) due in part to the difficulty of using geochemistry alone to distinguish between the ages of formation and the ages of the impact events that launched debris towards Earth. Here we solve the conundrum by combining in situ electron-beam nanostructural analyses and U-Pb (uranium-lead) isotopic measurements of the resistant micromineral baddeleyite (ZrO2) and host igneous minerals in the highly shock-metamorphosed shergottite Northwest Africa 5298 (ref. 8), which is a basaltic Martian meteorite. We establish that the micro-baddeleyite grains pre-date the launch event because they are shocked, cogenetic with host igneous minerals, and preserve primary igneous growth zoning. The grains least affected by shock disturbance, and which are rich in radiogenic Pb, date the basalt crystallization near the Martian surface to 187 +/- 33 million years before present. Primitive, non-radiogenic Pb isotope compositions of the host minerals, common to most shergottites(1-4), do not help us to date the meteorite, instead indicating a magma source region that was fractionated more than four billion years ago(9-12) to form a persistent reservoir so far unique to Mars(1,9). Local impact melting during ejection from Mars less than 22 +/- 2 million years ago caused the growth of unshocked, launch-generated zircon and the partial disturbance of baddeleyite dates. We can thus confirm the presence of ancient, non-convecting mantle beneath young volcanic Mars, place an upper bound on the interplanetary travel time of the ejected Martian crust, and validate a new approach to the geochronology of the inner Solar System.","[Moser, D.

Nevertheless, they remain rigid, which precludes their intimate integration into everyday life. Flexible, textile and stretchable electronics are emerging research areas and may yield mainstream technologies(1-3). Rollable and unbreakable backplanes with amorphous silicon field-effect transistors on steel substrates only 3 mu m thick have been demonstrated(4). On polymer substrates, bending radii of 0.1 mm have been achieved inflexible electronic devices(5-7). Concurrently, the need for compliant electronics that can not only be flexed but also conform to three-dimensional shapes has emerged(3). Approaches include the transfer of ultrathin polyimide layers encapsulating silicon CMOS circuits onto pre-stretched elastomers(8), the use of conductive elastomers integrated with organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) on polyimide islands(9), and fabrication of OFETs and gold interconnects on elastic substrates(10) to realize pressure, temperature and optical sensors(11-14). Here we present a platform that makes electronics both virtually unbreakable(4) and imperceptible. Fabricated directly on ultrathin (1 mu m) polymer foils, our electronic circuits are light (3 g m(-2)) and ultraflexible and conform to their ambient, dynamic environment. Organic transistors with an ultra-dense oxide gate dielectric a few nanometres thick formed at room temperature enable sophisticated large-area electronic foils with unprecedented mechanical and environmental stability: they withstand repeated bending to radii of 5 mu m and less, can be crumpled like paper, accommodate stretching up to 230% on prestrained elastomers, and can be operated at high temperatures and in aqueous environments. Because manufacturing costs of organic electronics are potentially low, imperceptible electronic foils may be as common in the future as plastic wrap is today. Applications include matrix-addressed tactile sensor foils for health care and monitoring, thin-film heaters, temperature and infrared sensors, displays(15), and organic solar cells(16).","[Kaltenbrunner, Martin; Sekitani, Tsuyoshi; Reeder, Jonathan; Yokota, Tomoyuki; Kuribara, Kazunori; Tokuhara, Takeyoshi; Someya, Takao] Univ Tokyo, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138656, Japan; [Kaltenbrunner, Martin; Sekitani, Tsuyoshi; Someya, Takao] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy JST, Exploratory Res Adv Technol ERATO, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130032, Japan; [Kaltenbrunner, Martin; Drack, Michael; Schwoediauer, Reinhard; Graz, Ingrid; Bauer-Gogonea, Simona; Bauer, Siegfried] Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, A-4040 Linz, Austria","Someya, T (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1138656, Japan.",martin@ntech.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp; someya@ee.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Bauer, Siegfried/A-2354-2009; Graz, Ingrid/A-7994-2011; Kaltenbrunner, Martin/G-8743-2012; Someya, Takao/H-3052-2015","Bauer, Siegfried/0000-0002-7770-9435; Graz, Ingrid/0000-0001-7205-4161; Kaltenbrunner, Martin/0000-0002-7247-9183; Someya, Takao/0000-0003-3051-1138; Reeder, Jonathan/0000-0002-7624-7355",JST Someya Bio-Harmonized ERATO; ERC; Wilhelm Macke Foundation; mobility programme of the Johannes Kepler University Linz (KIP),We thank I.

Although the conjecture for short timescales is well accepted, understanding Atlantic multidecadal variability (AMV) of SST2,3 remains a challenge as a result of limited ocean observations. AMV is nonetheless of major socio-economic importance because it is linked to important climate phenomena such as Atlantic hurricane activity and Sahel rainfall, and it hinders the detection of anthropogenic signals in the North Atlantic sector(4-6). Direct evidence of the oceanic influence of AMV can only be provided by surface heat fluxes, the language of ocean-atmosphere communication. Here we provide observational evidence that in the mid-latitude North Atlantic and on timescales longer than 10 years, surface turbulent heat fluxes are indeed driven by the ocean and may force the atmosphere, whereas on shorter timescales the converse is true, thereby confirming the Bjerknes conjecture. This result, although strongest in boreal winter, is found in all seasons. Our findings suggest that the predictability of mid-latitude North Atlantic air-sea interaction could extend beyond the ocean to the climate of surrounding continents.","[Gulev, Sergey K.] PP Shirshov Inst Oceanol, Moscow 117997, Russia; [Gulev, Sergey K.; Latif, Mojib; Park, Wonsun] GEOMAR Helmholtz Zentrum Ozeanforsch Kiel, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Gulev, Sergey K.; Koltermann, Klaus Peter] Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Fac Geog, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Latif, Mojib] Univ Kiel, Cluster Excellence Future Ocean, D-24118 Kiel, Germany; [Keenlyside, Noel] Univ Bergen, Inst Geophys, N-5007 Bergen, Norway; [Keenlyside, Noel] Univ Bergen, Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, N-5007 Bergen, Norway","Gulev, SK (reprint author), PP Shirshov Inst Oceanol, 36 Nakhimovsky Prospect, Moscow 117997, Russia.",gul@sail.msk.ru,"; Keenlyside, Noel/E-8303-2013; Park, Wonsun/J-8097-2012; Koltermann, Klaus Peter/D-4817-2014; Gulev, Sergey/A-4994-2014; Latif, Mojib/C-2428-2016","Koltermann, Klaus Peter/0000-0002-6038-7599; Keenlyside, Noel/0000-0002-8708-6868; Park, Wonsun/0000-0002-6345-8428; Latif, Mojib/0000-0003-1079-5604",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [KE 1471/2-1]; Russian Ministry of Education and Science through the Special Grant for establishing excellence at Russian Universities [11.G34.31.0007]; Russian Ministry of Education and Science; RACE project of the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research;  [2011-16-420-1-001];  [11.519.11.6034],"This study was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft under grant KE 1471/2-1 and by the Russian Ministry of Education and Science through the Special Grant for establishing excellence at Russian Universities, no. 11.G34.31.0007.

There is a growing concern that this might cause critical abundance thresholds of species to be crossed(1,3-5), with extinction cascades and state shifts in ecosystems as a consequence(4,6,7). When increased mortality rate and decreased abundance of a given species lead to extinction of other species, this species can be characterized as functionally extinct even though it still exists. Although such functional extinctions have been observed in some ecosystems(3,4,8), their frequency is largely unknown. Here we use a new modelling approach to explore the frequency and pattern of functional extinctions in ecological networks. Specifically, we analytically derive critical abundance thresholds of species by increasing their mortality rates until an extinction occurs in the network. Applying this approach on natural and theoretical food webs, we show that the species most likely to go extinct first is not the one whose mortality rate is increased but instead another species. Indeed, up to 80% of all first extinctions are of another species, suggesting that a species' ecological functionality is often lost before its own existence is threatened. Furthermore, we find that large-bodied species at the top of the food chains can only be exposed to small increases in mortality rate and small decreases in abundance before going functionally extinct compared to small-bodied species lower in the food chains. These results illustrate the potential importance of functional extinctions in ecological networks and lend strong support to arguments advocating a more community-oriented approach in conservation biology, with target levels for populations based on ecological functionality rather than on mere persistence(8-11).","[Saterberg, Torbjorn; Sellman, Stefan; Ebenman, Bo] Linkoping Univ, Dept Phys Chem & Biol, Div Theoret Biol, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden","Ebenman, B (reprint author), Linkoping Univ, Dept Phys Chem & Biol, Div Theoret Biol, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden.",boebe@ifm.liu.se,,,Linkoping University,"We thank N.

Here we sequence to high coverage a total of 79 wild-and captive-born individuals representing all six great ape species and seven subspecies and report 88.8 million single nucleotide polymorphisms. Our analysis provides support for genetically distinct populations within each species, signals of gene flow, and the split of common chimpanzees into two distinct groups: Nigeria-Cameroon/western and central/eastern populations. We find extensive inbreeding in almost all wild populations, with eastern gorillas being the most extreme. Inferred effective population sizes have varied radically over time in different lineages and this appears to have a profound effect on the genetic diversity at, or close to, genes in almost all species. We discover and assign 1,982 loss-of-function variants throughout the human and great ape lineages, determining that the rate of gene loss has not been different in the human branch compared to other internal branches in the great ape phylogeny. This comprehensive catalogue of great ape genome diversity provides a framework for understanding evolution and a resource for more effective management of wild and captive great ape populations.","[Prado-Martinez, Javier;

However, the mechanisms by which attention modulates neuronal communication to guide behaviour are poorly understood. To elucidate the synaptic mechanisms of attention, we developed a sensitive assay of attentional modulation of neuronal communication. In alert monkeys performing a visual spatial attention task, we probed thalamocortical communication by electrically stimulating neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus while simultaneously recording shock-evoked responses from monosynaptically connected neurons in primary visual cortex. We found that attention enhances neuronal communication by increasing the efficacy of presynaptic input in driving postsynaptic responses, by increasing synchronous responses among ensembles of postsynaptic neurons receiving independent input, and by decreasing redundant signals between postsynaptic neurons receiving common input. The results demonstrate that attention finely tunes neuronal communication at the synaptic level by selectively altering synaptic weights, enabling enhanced detection of salient events in the noisy sensory environment.","[Briggs, Farran; Usrey, W.

Despite many reports describing functional cell differentiation(2-4), no studies have succeeded in generating a three-dimensional vascularized organ such as liver. Here we show the generation of vascularized and functional human liver from human iPSCs by transplantation of liver buds created in vitro (iPSC-LBs). Specified hepatic cells (immature endodermal cells destined to track the hepatic cell fate) self-organized into three-dimensional iPSC-LBs by recapitulating organogenetic interactions between endothelial and mesenchymal cells(5). Immunostaining and gene-expression analyses revealed a resemblance between in vitro grown iPSC-LBs and in vivo liver buds. Human vasculatures in iPSC-LB transplants became functional by connecting to the host vessels within 48 hours. The formation of functional vasculatures stimulated the maturation of iPSC-LBs into tissue resembling the adult liver. Highly metabolic iPSC-derived tissue performed liver-specific functions such as protein production and human-specific drug metabolism without recipient liver replacement(6). Furthermore, mesenteric transplantation of iPSC-LBs rescued the drug-induced lethal liver failure model. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the generation of a functional human organ from pluripotent stem cells. Although efforts must ensue to translate these techniques to treatments for patients, this proof-of-concept demonstration of organ-bud transplantation provides a promising new approach to study regenerative medicine.","[Takebe, Takanori; Sekine, Keisuke; Enomura, Masahiro; Koike, Hiroyuki; Kimura, Masaki; Ogaeri, Takunori; Zhang, Ran-Ran; Ueno, Yasuharu; Zheng, Yun-Wen; Koike, Naoto; Taniguchi, Hideki] Yokohama City Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Regenerat Med, Kanazawa Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360004, Japan; [Takebe, Takanori; Taniguchi, Hideki] Yokohama City Univ, Adv Med Res Ctr, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360004, Japan; [Koike, Naoto] Seirei Sakura Citizen Hosp, Dept Surg, Sakura, Chiba 2858765, Japan; [Aoyama, Shinsuke; Adachi, Yasuhisa] Sekisui Med Co Ltd, ADME & Tox Res Inst, Tokai, Ibaraki 3191182, Japan","Takebe, T (reprint author), Yokohama City Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Regenerat Med, Kanazawa Ku, 3-9 Fukuura, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360004, Japan.",ttakebe@yokohama-cu.ac.jp; rtanigu@yokohama-cu.ac.jp,,,"Strategic Promotion of Innovative Research and Development (S-innovation) of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) [62890004]; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan [24106510, 24689052, 22390260, 21249071, 25253079]; Takeda Science Foundation; Japan IDDM network; Yokohama Foundation for Advanced Medical Science","We thank F.

The activation of mTOR, which is the catalytic subunit of the mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes, delivers an obligatory signal for the proper activation and differentiation of effector CD4(+) T cells(2,3), whereas in the regulatory T-cell (T-reg) compartment, the Akt-mTOR axis is widely acknowledged as a crucial negative regulator of T-reg-cell de novo differentiation(4-8) and population expansion(9). However, whether mTOR signalling affects the homeostasis and function of T-reg cells remains largely unexplored. Here we show that mTORC1 signalling is a pivotal positive determinant of T-reg-cell function in mice. T-reg cells have elevated steady-state mTORC1 activity compared to naive T cells. Signals through the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) provide major inputs for mTORC1 activation, which in turn programs the suppressive function of T-reg cells. Disruption of mTORC1 through T-reg-specific deletion of the essential component raptor leads to a profound loss of T-reg-cell suppressive activity in vivo and the development of a fatal early onset inflammatory disorder. Mechanistically, raptor/mTORC1 signalling in T-reg cells promotes cholesterol and lipid metabolism, with the mevalonate pathway particularly important for coordinating T-reg-cell proliferation and upregulation of the suppressive molecules CTLA4 and ICOS to establish T-reg-cell functional competency. By contrast, mTORC1 does not directly affect the expression of Foxp3 or anti-and pro-inflammatory cytokines in T-reg cells, suggesting a non-conventional mechanism for T-reg-cell functional regulation. Finally, we provide evidence that mTORC1 maintains T-reg-cell function partly through inhibiting the mTORC2 pathway. Our results demonstrate that mTORC1 acts as a fundamental 'rheostat' in T-reg cells to link immunological signals from TCR and IL-2 to lipogenic pathways and functional fitness, and highlight a central role of metabolic programming of T-reg-cell suppressive activity in immune homeostasis and tolerance.","[Zeng, Hu; Yang, Kai; Cloer, Caryn; Chi, Hongbo] St Jude Childrens Res Hosp, Dept Immunol, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Neale, Geoffrey] St Jude Childrens Res Hosp, Hartwell Ctr Bioinformat & Biotechnol, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Vogel, Peter] St Jude Childrens Res Hosp, Dept Pathol, Memphis, TN 38105 USA","Chi, HB (reprint author), St Jude Childrens Res Hosp, Dept Immunol, 332 N Lauderdale St, Memphis, TN 38105 USA.",hongbo.chi@stjude.org,,"Zeng, Hu/0000-0002-9909-7732","US National Institutes of Health [K01 AR053573, R21 AI094089, R01 AI101407, R01 NS064599]; Lupus Research Institute; American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities","We thank A.

Germline activating mutations in PTPN11 cause Noonan syndrome, whereas somatic PTPN11 mutations cause childhood myeloproliferative disease and contribute to some solid tumours. Recently, heterozygous inactivating mutations in PTPN11 were found in metachondromatosis, a rare inherited disorder featuring multiple exostoses, enchondromas, joint destruction and bony deformities(3,4). The detailed pathogenesis of this disorder has remained unclear. Here we use a conditional knockout (floxed) Ptpn11 allele (Ptpn11(fl)) and Cre recombinase transgenic mice to delete Ptpn11 specifically in monocytes, macrophages and osteoclasts (lysozyme M-Cre; LysMCre) or in cathepsin K (Ctsk)-expressing cells, previously thought to be osteoclasts. LysMCre; Ptpn11(fl/fl) mice had mild osteopetrosis. Notably, however, CtskCre; Ptpn11(fl/fl) mice developed features very similar to metachondromatosis. Lineage tracing revealed a novel population of CtskCre-expressing cells in the perichondrial groove of Ranvier that display markers and functional properties consistent with mesenchymal progenitors. Chondroid neoplasms arise from these cells and show decreased extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway activation, increased Indian hedgehog (Ihh) and parathyroid hormone-related protein (Pthrp, also known as Pthlh) expression and excessive proliferation. Shp2-deficient chondroprogenitors had decreased fibroblast growth factor-evoked ERK activation and enhanced Ihh and Pthrp expression, whereas fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) or mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor treatment of chondroid cells increased Ihh and Pthrp expression. Importantly, smoothened inhibitor treatment ameliorated metachondromatosis features in CtskCre; Ptpn11(fl/fl) mice. Thus, in contrast to its pro-oncogenic role in haematopoietic and epithelial cells, Ptpn11 is a tumour suppressor in cartilage, acting through a FGFR/MEK/ERK-dependent pathway in a novel progenitor cell population to prevent excessive Ihh production.","[Yang, Wentian; Wang, Jianguo; Moore, Douglas C.; Liang, Haipei; Terek, Richard; Chen, Qian; Ehrlich, Michael G.] Brown Univ, Alpert Med Sch, Dept Orthopaed, Providence, RI 02903 USA; [Yang, Wentian; Wang, Jianguo; Moore, Douglas C.; Liang, Haipei; Terek, Richard; Chen, Qian; Ehrlich, Michael G.] Rhode Isl Hosp, Providence, RI 02903 USA; [Dooner, Mark; Quesenberry, Peter J.] Rhode Isl Hosp, Dept Med, Providence, RI 02903 USA; [Dooner, Mark; Quesenberry, Peter J.] Rhode Isl Hosp, COBRE Ctr Stem Cell Biol, Providence, RI 02903 USA; [Dooner, Mark; Quesenberry, Peter J.] Brown Univ, Alpert Med Sch, Providence, RI 02903 USA; [Wu, Qian] Univ Connecticut, Ctr Hlth, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Farmington, CT 06030 USA; [Neel, Benjamin G.] Univ Toronto, Univ Hlth Network, Princess Margaret Canc Ctr, Toronto, ON M5G 1L7, Canada; [Neel, Benjamin G.] Univ Toronto, Dept Med Biophys, Toronto, ON M5G 1L7, Canada","Yang, WT (reprint author), Brown Univ, Alpert Med Sch, Dept Orthopaed, Providence, RI 02903 USA.",wyang@lifespan.org,,"terek, richard/0000-0002-6322-6790","National Institute for General Medicine Sciences (NIGMS) [8P20GM103468]; NIH [R21AR57156, R37CA49152]; Rhode Island Hospital Orthopaedic Foundation; Pediatric Orthopaedic Society of North America; Orthopaedic Research and Education Foundation; Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term Care; Princess Margaret Cancer Foundation","We thank S.

Infection seems to have involved contact with infected poultry(2,3). We have examined the receptor-binding properties of this H7N9 virus and compared them with those of an avian H7N3 virus. We find that the human H7 virus has significantly higher affinity for alpha-2, 6-linked sialic acid analogues ('human receptor') than avian H7 while retaining the strong binding to alpha-2,3-linked sialic acid analogues ('avian receptor') characteristic of avian viruses. The human H7 virus does not, therefore, have the preference for human versus avian receptors characteristic of pandemic viruses. X-ray crystallography of the receptor-binding protein, haemagglutinin (HA), in complex with receptor analogues indicates that both human and avian receptors adopt different conformations when bound to human H7 HA than they do when bound to avian H7 HA. Human receptor bound to human H7 HA exits the binding site in a different direction to that seen in complexes formed by HAs from pandemic viruses(4,5) and from an aerosol-transmissible H5 mutant(6). The human-receptor-binding properties of human H7 probably arise from the introduction of two bulky hydrophobic residues by the substitutions Gln226Leu and Gly186Val. The former is shared with the 1957 H2 and 1968 H3 pandemic viruses and with the aerosol-transmissible H5 mutant. We conclude that the human H7 virus has acquired some of the receptor-binding characteristics that are typical of pandemic viruses, but its retained preference for avian receptor may restrict its further evolution towards a virus that could transmit efficiently between humans, perhaps by binding to avian-receptor-rich mucins in the human respiratory tract(7) rather than to cellular receptors.","[Xiong, Xiaoli; Martin, Stephen R.; Haire, Lesley F.; Collins, Patrick J.; Walker, Philip A.; Skehel, John J.; Gamblin, Steven J.] Ridgeway, Natl Inst Med Res, MRC, London NW7 1AA, England; [Wharton, Stephen A.; Daniels, Rodney S.; Bennett, Michael S.; McCauley, John W.] Ridgeway, Natl Inst Med Res, MRC, WHO Collaborating Ctr Reference & Res Influenza, London NW7 1AA, England","Gamblin, SJ (reprint author), Ridgeway, Natl Inst Med Res, MRC, Mill Hill, London NW7 1AA, England.",skeheljj@nimr.mrc.ac.uk; sgambli@nimr.mrc.ac.uk,,"Gamblin, Steven/0000-0001-5331-639X","Medical Research Council [U117584222, U117570592, U117585868, U117512723]","We acknowledge Y.

Although the first epidemic has subsided, the presence of a natural reservoir and the disease severity highlight the need to evaluate its risk on human public health and to understand the possible pathogenesis mechanism. Here we show that the emerging H7N9 avian influenza virus poses a potentially high risk to humans. We discover that the H7N9 virus can bind to both avian-type (alpha 2,3-linked sialic acid) and human-type (alpha 2,6-linked sialic acid) receptors. It can invade epithelial cells in the human lower respiratory tract and type II pneumonocytes in alveoli, and replicated efficiently in ex vivo lung and trachea explant culture and several mammalian cell lines. In acute serum samples of H7N9-infected patients, increased levels of the chemokines and cytokines IP-10, MIG, MIP-1 beta, MCP-1, IL-6, IL-8 and IFN-alpha were detected.

In layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons of the mouse visual cortex, GCaMP6 reliably detected single action potentials in neuronal somata and orientation-tuned synaptic calcium transients in individual dendritic spines. The orientation tuning of structurally persistent spines was largely stable over timescales of weeks. Orientation tuning averaged across spine populations predicted the tuning of their parent cell. Although the somata of GABAergic neurons showed little orientation tuning, their dendrites included highly tuned dendritic segments (5-40-mm long).

However, the identity of muscle-specific proteins that directly govern this fusion process in mammals has remained elusive. Here we identify a muscle-specific membrane protein, named myomaker, that controls myoblast fusion. Myomaker is expressed on the cell surface of myoblasts during fusion and is downregulated thereafter. Overexpression of myomaker in myoblasts markedly enhances fusion, and genetic disruption of myomaker in mice causes perinatal death due to an absence of multi-nucleated muscle fibres. Remarkably, forced expression of myomaker in fibroblasts promotes fusion with myoblasts, demonstrating the direct participation of this protein in the fusion process. Pharmacological perturbation of the actin cytoskeleton abolishes the activity of myomaker, consistent with previous studies implicating actin dynamics in myoblast fusion. These findings reveal a long-sought myogenic fusion protein that controls mammalian myoblast fusion and provide new insights into the molecular underpinnings of muscle formation.","[Millay, Douglas P.; O'Rourke, Jason R.; Sutherland, Lillian B.; Bezprozvannaya, Svetlana; Bassel-Duby, Rhonda; Olson, Eric N.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Mol Biol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Shelton, John M.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Internal Med, Dallas, TX 75390 USA","Olson, EN (reprint author), Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Mol Biol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA.",eric.olson@utsouthwestern.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health National Research Service Award Fellowship [F32AR05948403]; National Institutes of Health [HL-077439, HL-111665, HL093039, U01-HL-100401]; Robert A.

Although many regulators of pathogenic angiogenesis have been identified, our understanding of this process is incomplete. Here we explore the transcriptome of retinal microvessels isolated from mouse models of retinal disease that exhibit vascular pathology, and uncover an upregulated gene, leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein 1 (Lrg1), of previously unknown function. We show that in the presence of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), LRG1 is mitogenic to endothelial cells and promotes angiogenesis. Mice lacking Lrg1 develop a mild retinal vascular phenotype but exhibit a significant reduction in pathological ocular angiogenesis. LRG1 binds directly to the TGF-beta accessory receptor endoglin, which, in the presence of TGF-beta 1, results in promotion of the pro-angiogenic Smad1/5/8 signalling pathway. LRG1 antibody blockade inhibits this switch and attenuates angiogenesis. These studies reveal a new regulator of angiogenesis that mediates its effect by modulating TGF-beta signalling.","[Wang, Xiaomeng; Abraham, Sabu; McKenzie, Jenny A.

It is the basis for a variety of circuits and devices, with applications ranging from medicine(2) to quantum information(3). Experiments using Josephson circuits that behave like artificial atoms(4) are now revolutionizing the way we probe and exploit the laws of quantum physics(5,6). Microscopically, the supercurrent is carried by Andreev pair states, which are localized at the weak link. These states come in doublets and have energies inside the superconducting gap(7-10). Existing Josephson circuits are based on properties of just the ground state of each doublet, and so far the excited states have not been directly detected. Here we establish their existence through spectroscopic measurements of superconducting atomic contacts. The spectra, which depend on the atomic configuration and on the phase difference between the superconductors, are in complete agreement with theory. Andreev doublets could be exploited to encode information in novel types of superconducting qubits(11-13).","[Bretheau, L.; Girit, C.

So far, the perovskite pigment has been deposited in a single step onto mesoporous metal oxide films using a mixture of PbX2 and CH3NH3X in a common solvent. However, the uncontrolled precipitation of the perovskite produces large morphological variations, resulting in a wide spread of photovoltaic performance in the resulting devices, which hampers the prospects for practical applications. Here we describe a sequential deposition method for the formation of the perovskite pigment within the porous metal oxide film. PbI2 is first introduced from solution into a nanoporous titanium dioxide film and subsequently transformed into the perovskite by exposing it to a solution of CH3NH3I. We find that the conversion occurs within the nanoporous host as soon as the two components come into contact, permitting much better control over the perovskite morphology than is possible with the previously employed route. Using this technique for the fabrication of solid-state mesoscopic solar cells greatly increases the reproducibility of their performance and allows us to achieve a power conversion efficiency of approximately 15 per cent (measured under standard AM1.5G test conditions on solar zenith angle, solar light intensity and cell temperature). This two-step method should provide new opportunities for the fabrication of solution-processed photovoltaic cells with unprecedented power conversion efficiencies and high stability equal to or even greater than those of today's best thin-film photovoltaic devices.","[Burschka, Julian; Pellet, Norman; Moon, Soo-Jin; Humphry-Baker, Robin; Gao, Peng; Nazeeruddin, Mohammad K.; Graetzel, Michael] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Chem & Chem Engn, Lab Photon & Interfaces, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Pellet, Norman] Max Planck Inst Solid State Res, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany","Gratzel, M (reprint author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Chem & Chem Engn, Lab Photon & Interfaces, Stn 6, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",michael.graetzel@epfl.ch,"Nazeeruddin, Mohammad/B-1323-2008; Gao, Peng/F-3114-2012","Gao, Peng/0000-0002-4963-2282","Aisin Cosmos R&D Co., Ltd, Japan; European Community [ENERGY.2012.10.2.1]; NANOMATCELL [308997]; Global Research Laboratory Program, Korea; Center for Advanced Molecular Photovoltaics of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology [KUS-C1-015-21]; Solvay S.A.; Ministry of Education, Science and Technology through the National Research Foundation of Korea [R31-2008-000-10035-0]; Max Planck Society; King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah; Nanyang Technolocal University, Singapore; European Research Council [ARG 247404]","We thank M.

They are involved in a number of biological processes, including phenylalanine metabolism, the production of neuro-transmitters, the hypoxic response and the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites(1-3). The reactive intermediate in the catalytic cycles of these enzymes is a high-spin S = 2 Fe(IV)=O species, which has been trapped for a number of NHFe enzymes(4-8), including the halogenase SyrB2 (syringomycin biosynthesis enzyme 2). Computational studies aimed at understanding the reactivity of this Fe(IV)=O intermediate(9-13) are limited in applicability owing to the paucity of experimental knowledge about its geometric and electronic structure. Synchrotron-based nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopy (NRVS) is a sensitive and effective method that defines the dependence of the vibrational modes involving Fe on the nature of the Fe(IV)=O active site(14-16). Here we present NRVS structural characterization of the reactive Fe(IV)=O intermediate of a NHFe enzyme, namely the halogenase SyrB2 from the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae. This intermediate reacts via an initial hydrogen-atom abstraction step, performing subsequent halogenation of the native substrate or hydroxylation of non-native substrates(17). Acorrelation of the experimental NRVS data to electronic structure calculations indicates that the substrate directs the orientation of the Fe(IV)=O intermediate, presenting specific frontier molecular orbitals that can activate either selective halogenation or hydroxylation.","[Wong, Shaun D.; Srnec, Martin; Liu, Lei V.; Kwak, Yeonju; Park, Kiyoung; Bell, Caleb B., III; Solomon, Edward I.] Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Matthews, Megan L.; Krebs, Carsten; Bollinger, J.

The ratio of water loss to carbon gain, or water-use efficiency, is a key characteristic of ecosystem function that is central to the global cycles of water, energy and carbon(2). Here we analyse direct, long-term measurements of whole-ecosystem carbon and water exchange(3). We find a substantial increase in water-use efficiency in temperate and boreal forests of the Northern Hemisphere over the past two decades. We systematically assess various competing hypotheses to explain this trend, and find that the observed increase is most consistent with a strong CO2 fertilization effect. The results suggest a partial closure of stomata(1)-small pores on the leaf surface that regulate gas exchange-to maintain a near-constant concentration of CO2 inside the leaf even under continually increasing atmospheric CO2 levels. The observed increase in forest water-use efficiency is larger than that predicted by existing theory and 13 terrestrial biosphere models. The increase is associated with trends of increasing ecosystem-level photosynthesis and net carbon uptake, and decreasing evapotranspiration. Our findings suggest a shift in the carbon-and water-based economics of terrestrial vegetation, which may require a reassessment of the role of stomatal control in regulating interactions between forests and climate change, and a re-evaluation of coupled vegetation-climate models.","[Keenan, Trevor F.; Richardson, Andrew D.] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Hollinger, David Y.] US Forest Serv, No Res Stn, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Bohrer, Gil] Ohio State Univ, Dept Civil Environm & Geodet Engn, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Dragoni, Danilo] Indiana Univ, Dept Geog, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Munger, J.

The amount of volatiles contained in the late veneer is a key constraint on the budget and the origin of the volatiles in Earth. At high pressures and temperatures, the moderately volatile chalcogen elements sulphur (S), selenium (Se) and tellurium (Te) are moderately to highly siderophile; thus, if depleted by core formation their mantle abundances should reflect the volatile composition of the late veneer(3,4). Here we report ratios and abundances of S, Se and Te in the mantle determined from new isotope dilution data for post-Archaean mantle peridotites. The mean S/Se and Se/Te ratios of mantle lherzolites overlap with CI (Ivuna-type) carbonaceous chondrite values(5,6). The Se/Te ratios of ordinary and enstatite chondrites are significantly different. The chalcogen/HSE ratio of the BSE is similar to that of CM (Mighei-type) carbonaceous chondrites, consistent with the view that the HSE signature of the BSE reflects a predominance of slightly volatile-depleted, carbonaceous-chondrite-like material, possibly with a minor proportion of non-chondritic material(7). Depending on the estimates for the abundances of water and carbon in the BSE8, the late veneer may have supplied 20 to 100 per cent of the budget of hydrogen and carbon in the BSE.","[Wang, Zaicong; Becker, Harry] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Geol Wissensch, D-12249 Berlin, Germany","Wang, ZC (reprint author), Free Univ Berlin, Inst Geol Wissensch, Malteserstr 74-100, D-12249 Berlin, Germany.",zaicongwang@gmail.com; hbecker@zedat.fu-berlin.de,"Wang, Zaicong/D-3434-2014","Wang, Zaicong/0000-0002-3584-1673",Freie Universitat Berlin; China Scholarship Council fellowship,"Some peridotite and meteorite samples were provided by S.

Here we show that an autosome of Drosophila, the dot chromosome, was ancestrally a differentiated X chromosome. We analyse the whole genome of true fruitflies (Tephritidae), flesh flies (Sarcophagidae) and soldier flies (Stratiomyidae) to show that genes located on the dot chromosome of Drosophila are X-linked in outgroup species, whereas Drosophila X-linked genes are autosomal. We date this chromosomal transition to early drosophilid evolution by sequencing the genome of other Drosophilidae. Our results reveal several puzzling aspects of Drosophila dot chromosome biology to be possible remnants of its former life as a sex chromosome, such as its minor feminizing role in sex determination(5) or its targeting by a chromosome-specific regulatory mechanism(6). We also show that patterns of biased gene expression of the dot chromosome during early embryogenesis, oogenesis and spermatogenesis resemble that of the current X chromosome. Thus, although sex chromosomes are not necessarily evolutionary end points and can revert back to an autosomal inheritance, the highly specialized genome architecture of this former X chromosome suggests that severe fitness costs must be overcome for such a turnover to occur.","[Vicoso, Beatriz; Bachtrog, Doris] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Ctr Theoret Evolutionary Genom, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Bachtrog, D (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Ctr Theoret Evolutionary Genom, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",dbachtrog@berkeley.edu,,"Vicoso, Beatriz/0000-0002-4579-8306","National Institutes of Health [R01GM076007, R01GM093182]; Packard Fellowship","We thank S.

Here we show task-dependent activation of distinct, largely non-overlapping long-range projection neurons in the whisker region of primary somatosensory cortex (S1) in awake, behaving mice. Using two-photon calcium imaging, we monitored neuronal activity in anatomically identified S1 neurons projecting to secondary somatosensory (S2) or primary motor (M1) cortex in mice using their whiskers to perform a texture-discrimination task or a task that required them to detect the presence of an object at a certain location. Whisking-related cells were found among S2-projecting (S2P) but not M1-projecting (M1P) neurons. A higher fraction of S2P than M1P neurons showed touch-related responses during texture discrimination, whereas a higher fraction of M1P than S2P neurons showed touch-related responses during the detection task. In both tasks, S2P and M1P neurons could discriminate similarly between trials producing different behavioural decisions. However, in trials producing the same decision, S2P neurons performed better at discriminating texture, whereas M1P neurons were better at discriminating location. Sensory stimulus features alone were not sufficient to elicit these differences, suggesting that selective transmission of S1 information to S2 and M1 is driven by behaviour.","[Chen, Jerry L.; Carta, Stefano; Soldado-Magraner, Joana; Helmchen, Fritjof] Univ Zurich, Brain Res Inst, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Carta, Stefano; Helmchen, Fritjof] Univ Zurich, ETH Zurich, Neurosci Ctr Zurich, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Soldado-Magraner, Joana] Univ Zurich, ETH Zurich, Inst Neuroinformat, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Schneider, Bernard L.] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Brain Mind Inst, EPFL SV BMI LEN, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","Helmchen, F (reprint author), Univ Zurich, Brain Res Inst, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",helmchen@hifo.uzh.ch,"Schneider, Bernard/H-6168-2011","Schneider, Bernard/0000-0001-5485-8748; Chen, Jerry/0000-0002-7409-7859","Swiss National Science Foundation [310030-127091]; EU [223524, 243914]; Swiss SystemsX.ch initiative; National Center of Competence in Research 'Neural Plasticity and Repair'; Forschungskredit of the University of Zurich [541541808]; US National Science Foundation [1158914]","We thank S.

RTT is caused by mutations in methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2), a nuclear protein that, in neurons, regulates transcription, is expressed at high levels similar to that of histones, and binds to methylated cytosines broadly across the genome(1-5). By phosphotryptic mapping, we identify three sites (S86, S274 and T308) of activity-dependent MeCP2 phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of these sites is differentially induced by neuronal activity, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, or agents that elevate the intracellular level of 3',5'-cyclic AMP (cAMP), indicating that MeCP2 may function as an epigenetic regulator of gene expression that integrates diverse signals from the environment. Here we show that the phosphorylation of T308 blocks the interaction of the repressor domain of MeCP2 with the nuclear receptor co-repressor (NCoR) complex and suppresses the ability of MeCP2 to repress transcription. In knock-in mice bearing the common human RTT missense mutation R306C, neuronal activity fails to induce MeCP2 T308 phosphorylation, suggesting that the loss of T308 phosphorylation might contribute to RTT. Consistent with this possibility, the mutation of MeCP2 T308A in mice leads to a decrease in the induction of a subset of activity-regulated genes and to RTT-like symptoms. These findings indicate that the activity-dependent phosphorylation of MeCP2 at T308 regulates the interaction of MeCP2 with the NCoR complex, and that RTT in humans may be due, in part, to the loss of activity-dependent MeCP2 T308 phosphorylation and a disruption of the phosphorylation-regulated interaction of MeCP2 with the NCoR complex.","[Ebert, Daniel H.; Gabel, Harrison W.; Robinson, Nathaniel D.; Kastan, Nathaniel R.; Hu, Linda S.; Cohen, Sonia; Navarro, Adrija J.; Greenberg, Michael E.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Ebert, Daniel H.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Lyst, Matthew J.; Ekiert, Robert; Bird, Adrian P.] Univ Edinburgh, Wellcome Trust Ctr Cell Biol, Edinburgh EH9 3JR, Midlothian, Scotland","Greenberg, ME (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",michael_greenberg@hms.harvard.edu,,"Ekiert, Robert/0000-0002-8879-0646; Lyst, Matthew/0000-0001-9018-4138","NIH [RO1NS048276, K08MH90306, P30-HD 18655]; Rett Syndrome Research Trust; Dupont-Warren Fellowship in the Department of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School; Nancy Lurie Marks Fellowship in Autism at Harvard Medical School; Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation [DRG-2048-10]","This work was supported by NIH grant RO1NS048276 and the Rett Syndrome Research Trust to M.

This is the longest reported lifespan for a rodent species and is especially striking considering the small body mass of the naked mole rat. In comparison, a similarly sized house mouse has a maximum lifespan of 4 years(4,5). In addition to their longevity, naked mole rats show an unusual resistance to cancer. Multi-year observations of large naked mole-rat colonies did not detect a single incidence of cancer(2,6). Here we identify a mechanism responsible for the naked mole rat's cancer resistance. We found that naked mole-rat fibroblasts secrete extremely high-molecular-mass hyaluronan (HA), which is over five times larger than human or mouse HA. This high-molecular-mass HA accumulates abundantly in naked mole-rat tissues owing to the decreased activity of HA-degrading enzymes and a unique sequence of hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2). Furthermore, the naked mole-rat cells are more sensitive to HA signalling, as they have a higher affinity to HA compared with mouse or human cells. Perturbation of the signalling pathways sufficient for malignant transformation of mouse fibroblasts fails to transform naked mole-rat cells. However, once high molecular-mass HA is removed by either knocking down HAS2 or overexpressing the HA-degrading enzyme, HYAL2, naked mole-rat cells become susceptible to malignant transformation and readily form tumours in mice. We speculate that naked mole rats have evolved a higher concentration of HA in the skin to provide skin elasticity needed for life in underground tunnels. This trait may have then been co-opted to provide cancer resistance and longevity to this species.","[Tian, Xiao; Azpurua, Jorge; Hine, Christopher; Vaidya, Amita; Myakishev-Rempel, Max; Ablaeva, Julia; Mao, Zhiyong; Gorbunova, Vera; Seluanov, Andrei] Univ Rochester, Dept Biol, Rochester, NY 14627 USA; [Mao, Zhiyong] Tongji Univ, Sch Life Sci & Technol, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; [Nevo, Eviatar] Univ Haifa, Inst Evolut, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel","Gorbunova, V (reprint author), Univ Rochester, Dept Biol, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.",vera.gorbunova@rochester.edu; andrei.seluanov@rochester.edu,"Tian, Xiao/E-3998-2017","Tian, Xiao/0000-0001-5300-3596; Myakishev-, Max/0000-0002-7893-2049",US National Institutes of Health; Ellison Medical Foundation,This work was supported by the grants from the US National Institutes of Health and Ellison Medical Foundation to V.

We identify specific carbohydrate moieties on specific surface glycoproteins that serve as receptors for typhoid toxin, which explains its broad cell target specificity. We present the atomic structure of typhoid toxin, which shows an unprecedented A(2)B(5) organization with two covalently linked A subunits non-covalently associated to a pentameric B subunit. The structure provides insight into the toxin's receptor-binding specificity and delivery mechanisms and reveals how the activities of two powerful toxins have been co-opted into a single, unique toxin that can induce many of the symptoms characteristic of typhoid fever.

The commonly accepted molecular mechanism for riboswitch function proposes a ligand-dependent conformational switch between two mutually exclusive states(4). According to this mechanism, ligand binding to an aptamer domain induces an allosteric conformational switch of an expression platform, leading to activation or repression of ligand-related gene expression(5). However, many riboswitch properties cannot be explained by a pure two-state mechanism. Here we show that the regulation mechanism of the adenine-sensing riboswitch, encoded by the add gene on chromosome II of the human Gram-negative pathogenic bacterium Vibrio vulnificus(6), is notably different from a two-state switch mechanism in that it involves three distinct stable conformations. We characterized the temperature and Mg2+ dependence of the population ratios of the three conformations and the kinetics of their interconversion at nucleotide resolution. The observed temperature dependence of a pre-equilibrium involving two structurally distinct ligand-free conformations of the add riboswitch conferred efficient regulation over a physiologically relevant temperature range. Such robust switching is a key requirement for gene regulation in bacteria that have to adapt to environments with varying temperatures. The translational adenine-sensing riboswitch represents the first example, to our knowledge, of a temperature-compensated regulatory RNA element.","[Reining, Anke; Nozinovic, Senada; Schlepckow, Kai; Buhr, Florian; Fuertig, Boris; Schwalbe, Harald] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Organ Chem & Chem Biol, Ctr Biomol Magnet Resonance, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany","Schwalbe, H (reprint author), Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Organ Chem & Chem Biol, Ctr Biomol Magnet Resonance, Max von Laue Str 7, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany.",fuertig@nmr.uni-frankfurt.de; schwalbe@nmr.uni-frankfurt.de,"Schwalbe, Harald/F-9023-2010; Fachbereich14, Dekanat/C-8553-2015","Schwalbe, Harald/0000-0001-5693-7909; Furtig, Boris/0000-0001-6443-7656",German funding agency (DFG) in Collaborative Research Center 902,"We thank E.

In particular, although RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) initiates divergently from most active gene promoters, productive elongation occurs primarily in the sense-coding direction(2-4). Here we show in mouse embryonic stem cells that asymmetric sequence determinants flanking gene transcription start sites control promoter directionality by regulating promoter-proximal cleavage and polyadenylation. We find that upstream antisense RNAs are cleaved and polyadenylated at poly(A) sites (PASs) shortly after initiation. De novo motif analysis shows PAS signals and U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) recognition sites to be the most depleted and enriched sequences, respectively, in the sense direction relative to the upstream antisense direction. These U1 snRNP sites and PAS sites are progressively gained and lost, respectively, at the 5' end of coding genes during vertebrate evolution. Functional disruption of U1 snRNP activity results in a dramatic increase in promoter-proximal cleavage events in the sense direction with slight increases in the antisense direction. These data suggest that a U1-PAS axis characterized by low U1 snRNP recognition and a high density of PASs in the upstream antisense region reinforces promoter directionality by promoting early termination in upstream antisense regions, whereas proximal sense PAS signals are suppressed by U1 snRNP. We propose that the U1-PAS axis limits pervasive transcription throughout the genome.","[Almada, Albert E.; Wu, Xuebing; Sharp, Phillip A.] MIT, David H Koch Inst Integrat Canc Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Almada, Albert E.; Kriz, Andrea J.; Burge, Christopher B.; Sharp, Phillip A.] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Wu, Xuebing; Burge, Christopher B.] MIT, Computat & Syst Biol Grad Program, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Sharp, PA (reprint author), MIT, David H Koch Inst Integrat Canc Res, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",sharppa@mit.edu,,,"United States Public Health Service grants from the National Institutes of Health [RO1-GM34277, R01-CA133404]; National Cancer Institute [P30-CA14051]; Public Health Service research grant from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences [M-085319]","The authors acknowledge the service to the MIT community of the late Sean Collier.

To optimize energy usage, bacteria have developed an integrated control system to preferentially uptake carbohydrates that support rapid growth. The availability of a preferred carbon source, such as glucose, represses the synthesis and activities of proteins necessary for the transport and metabolism of secondary carbon sources. This regulatory phenomenon is defined as carbon catabolite repression(1). In enteric bacteria, the key player of carbon catabolite repression is a component of the glucose-specific phosphotransferase system, enzyme IIA (EIIA(Glc))(1,2). It is known that unphosphorylated EIIA(Glc) binds to and inhibits a variety of transporters when glucose is available(1,2). However, understanding the underlying molecular mechanism has been hindered by the complete absence of structures for any EIIA(Glc)-transporter complexes. Here we present the 3.9 angstrom crystal structure of Escherichia coli EIIA(Glc) in complex with the maltose transporter, an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter. The structure shows that two EIIA(Glc) molecules bind to the cytoplasmic ATPase subunits, stabilizing the transporter in an inward-facing conformation and preventing the structural rearrangements necessary for ATP hydrolysis. We also show that the half-maximal inhibitory concentrations of the full-length EIIA(Glc) and an amino-terminal truncation mutant differ by 60-fold, consistent with the hypothesis that the amino-terminal region, disordered in the crystal structure, functions as a membrane anchor to increase the effective EIIA(Glc) concentration at the membrane(3,4). Together these data suggest a model of how the central regulatory protein EIIAGlc allosterically inhibits maltose uptake in E. coli.","[Chen, Shanshuang; Chen, Jue] Purdue Univ, Dept Biol Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Oldham, Michael L.; Chen, Jue] Howard Hughes Med Inst, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Davidson, Amy L.] Purdue Univ, Dept Chem, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Chen, J (reprint author), Purdue Univ, Dept Biol Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",chenjue@purdue.edu,,,National Institutes of Health [GM070515],"We thank the staff at the Advance Photon Source GM/CA-CAT, NE-CAT and SBC for assistance with data collection.

Activated receptor tyrosine kinases, for example, engage scaffolds such as Shc1 that contain phosphotyrosine (pTyr)-binding (PTB) domains. Using quantitative mass spectrometry, here we show that mammalian Shc1 responds to epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation through multiple waves of distinct phosphorylation events and protein interactions. After stimulation, Shc1 rapidly binds a group of proteins that activate pro-mitogenic or survival pathways dependent on recruitment of the Grb2 adaptor to Shc1 pTyr sites. Akt-mediated feedback phosphorylation of Shc1 Ser 29 then recruits the Ptpn12 tyrosine phosphatase. This is followed by a sub-network of proteins involved in cytoskeletal reorganization, trafficking and signal termination that binds Shc1 with delayed kinetics, largely through the SgK269 pseudokinase/adaptor protein. Ptpn12 acts as a switch to convert Shc1 from pTyr/Grb2-based signalling to SgK269-mediated pathways that regulate cell invasion and morphogenesis. The Shc1 scaffold therefore directs the temporal flow of signalling information after EGF stimulation.","[Zheng, Yong; Zhang, Cunjie; Soliman, Mohamed A.; St-Denis, Nicole; Pasculescu, Adrian; Taylor, Lorne; Colwill, Karen; Dai, Anna Yue; Bagshaw, Rick; Dennis, James W.; Gingras, Anne-Claude; Pawson, Tony] Mt Sinai Hosp, Samuel Lunenfeld Res Inst, Toronto, ON M5G 1X5, Canada; [Croucher, David R.] Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Dublin, Syst Biol Ireland, Dublin 4, Ireland; [Soliman, Mohamed A.; Dennis, James W.; Gingras, Anne-Claude; Pawson, Tony] Univ Toronto, Dept Mol Genet, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [Soliman, Mohamed A.] Cairo Univ, Fac Pharm, Dept Biochem, Cairo, Egypt; [Tate, Stephen A.] AB SCIEX, Concord, ON L4K 4V8, Canada; [Hardy, W.

Here we report a systematic analysis of the RNA motifs recognized by RNA-binding proteins, encompassing 205 distinct genes from 24 diverse eukaryotes. The sequence specificities of RNA-binding proteins display deep evolutionary conservation, and the recognition preferences for a large fraction of metazoan RNA-binding proteins can thus be inferred from their RNA-binding domain sequence. The motifs that we identify in vitro correlate well with in vivo RNA-binding data. Moreover, we can associate them with distinct functional roles in diverse types of post-transcriptional regulation, enabling new insights into the functions of RNA-binding proteins both in normal physiology and in human disease. These data provide an unprecedented overview of RNA-binding proteins and their targets, and constitute an invaluable resource for determining post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms in eukaryotes.","[Ray, Debashish; Weirauch, Matthew T.; Najafabadi, Hamed S.; Albu, Mihai; Zheng, Hong; Yang, Ally; Na, Hong; Irimia, Manuel; Fraser, Andrew G.; Blencowe, Benjamin J.; Morris, Quaid D.; Hughes, Timothy R.] Univ Toronto, Donnelly Ctr, Toronto, ON M5S 3E1, Canada; [Kazan, Hilal; Morris, Quaid D.] Univ Toronto, Dept Comp Sci, Toronto, ON M5S 2E4, Canada; [Cook, Kate B.; Li, Xiao; Gueroussov, Serge; Lipshitz, Howard D.; Fraser, Andrew G.; Blencowe, Benjamin J.; Morris, Quaid D.; Hughes, Timothy R.] Univ Toronto, Dept Mol Genet, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [Najafabadi, Hamed S.; Frey, Brendan J.; Morris, Quaid D.] Univ Toronto, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Toronto, ON M5S 3G4, Canada; [Matzat, Leah H.; Dale, Ryan K.; Lei, Elissa P.] NIDDK, Lab Cellular & Dev Biol, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Smith, Sarah A.; Yarosh, Christopher A.; Nabet, Behnam; Carstens, Russ P.; Lynch, Kristen W.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Dept Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Kelly, Seth M.; Corbett, Anita H.] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Mecenas, Desirea; Piano, Fabio] NYU, Dept Biol, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Mecenas, Desirea; Piano, Fabio] NYU, Ctr Genom & Syst Biol, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Li, Weimin; Laishram, Rakesh S.; Anderson, Richard A.] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Med & Publ Hlth, Mol & Cellular Pharmacol Program, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Qiao, Mei; Penalva, Luiz O.

Adaptations to hypoxia are thought to have a prominent role in M. tuberculosis pathogenesis. Using ChIP-Seq combined with expression data from the induction of the same factors, we have reconstructed a draft regulatory network based on 50 transcription factors. This network model revealed a direct interconnection between the hypoxic response, lipid catabolism, lipid anabolism and the production of cell wall lipids. As a validation of this model, in response to oxygen availability we observe substantial alterations in lipid content and changes in gene expression and metabolites in corresponding metabolic pathways. The regulatory network reveals transcription factors underlying these changes, allows us to computationally predict expression changes, and indicates that Rv0081 is a regulatory hub.","[Galagan, James E.; Peterson, Matthew; Mahwinney, Chris; Krueger, Andrew; Jaini, Suma; Honda, Brent; Yu, Wen-Han; Garay, Christopher; Iazzetti, Paul; Camacho, Diogo; Dreyfuss, Jonathan] Boston Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Galagan, James E.; Park, Sang Tae; Raman, Sahadevan] Boston Univ, Dept Microbiol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Galagan, James E.; Lyubetskaya, Anna; Azizi, Elham; Gomes, Antonio; Glotova, Irina] Boston Univ, Bioinformat Program, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Galagan, James E.; Abeel, Thomas; Zucker, Jeremy; Weiner, Brian; Sisk, Peter; Stolte, Christian] Eli & Edythe L Broad Inst Harvard & MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Minch, Kyle; Rustad, Tige; Brabant, William; Hickey, Mark J.; Winkler, Jessica K.; Sherman, David R.] Seattle Biomed Res Inst, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Sweet, Linsday; Moody, D.

However, these analyses have largely ignored the fact that some debris disks are found to contain small quantities of gas(4-9), a component that all such disks should contain at some level(10,11). Several debris disks have been measured with a dust-to-gas ratio of about unity(4-9), at which the effect of hydrodynamics on the structure of the disk cannot be ignored(12,13). Here we report linear and nonlinear modelling that shows that dust-gas interactions can produce some of the key patterns attributed to planets. We find a robust clumping instability that organizes the dust into narrow, eccentric rings, similar to the Fomalhaut debris disk(14).

Many light confinement methods exist, but they all achieve confinement with materials or systems that forbid outgoing waves. These systems can be implemented by metallic mirrors, by photonic band-gap materials(1), by highly disordered media (Anderson localization(2)) and, for a subset of outgoing waves, by translational symmetry (total internal reflection1) or by rotational or reflection symmetry(3,4). Exceptions to these examples exist only in theoretical proposals(5-8). Here we predict and show experimentally that light can be perfectly confined in a patterned dielectric slab, even though outgoing waves are allowed in the surrounding medium. Technically, this is an observation of an 'embedded eigenvalue' 9-namely, a bound state in a continuum of radiation modes-that is not due to symmetry incompatibility(5-8,10-16). Such a bound state can exist stably in a general class of geometries in which all of its radiation amplitudes vanish simultaneously as a result of destructive interference. This method to trap electromagnetic waves is also applicable to electronic(12) and mechanical waves(14,15).","[Hsu, Chia Wei; Zhen, Bo; Lee, Jeongwon; Chua, Song-Liang; Johnson, Steven G.; Joannopoulos, John D.; Soljacic, Marin] MIT, Elect Res Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Hsu, Chia Wei] Harvard Univ, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Johnson, Steven G.] MIT, Dept Math, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Hsu, CW (reprint author), MIT, Elect Res Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",cwhsu@mit.edu,"Hsu, Chia Wei (Wade)/G-5486-2011","Hsu, Chia Wei (Wade)/0000-0002-9609-7155; Johnson, Steven/0000-0001-7327-4967","Army Research Office through the Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies [W911NF-07-D0004]; S3TEC, an Energy Frontier Research Center; US Department of Energy [DE-SC0001299]; Materials Research Science and Engineering Centers of the National Science Foundation [DMR-0819762]","We thank L.

Several approaches to oxidizing aliphatic C-H bonds have been described, drastically simplifying the synthesis of complex molecules(1-6). However, the selective oxidation of aromatic C-H bonds under mild conditions, especially in the context of substituted arenes with diverse functional groups, remains a challenge. The direct hydroxylation of arenes was initially achieved through the use of strong Bronsted or Lewis acids to mediate electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions with super-stoichiometric equivalents of oxidants, significantly limiting the scope of the reaction(7). Because the products of these reactions are more reactive than the starting materials, over-oxidation is frequently a competitive process. Transition-metal-catalysed C-H oxidation of arenes with or without directing groups has been developed, improving on the acid-mediated process; however, precious metals are required(8-13). Here we demonstrate that phthaloyl peroxide functions as a selective oxidant for the transformation of arenes to phenols under mild conditions. Although the reaction proceeds through a radical mechanism, aromatic C-H bonds are selectively oxidized in preference to activated Csp3-H bonds. Notably, a wide array of functional groups are compatible with this reaction, and this method is therefore well suited for late-stage transformations of advanced synthetic intermediates. Quantum mechanical calculations indicate that this transformation proceeds through a novel addition-abstraction mechanism, a kind of 'reverse-rebound' mechanism as distinct from the common oxygen-rebound mechanism observed for metal-oxo oxidants. These calculations also identify the origins of the experimentally observed aryl selectivity.","[Yuan, Changxia; Hernandez, Taylor; Berriochoa, Adrian; Siegel, Dionicio] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Chem & Biochem, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Liang, Yong; Houk, Kendall N.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Chem & Biochem, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Siegel, D (reprint author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Chem & Biochem, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",dsiegel@cm.utexas.edu,"Yuan, Changxia/K-9293-2013; Liang, Yong/J-4541-2017","Liang, Yong/0000-0001-5026-6710","University of Texas at Austin; Welch Foundation [F-1694]; US National Science Foundation [CHE-1059084, OCI-1053575]","Financial support from the University of Texas at Austin, the Welch Foundation (F-1694 to D.

The target that is currently recognized by most world governments(1) places a limit of two degrees Celsius on the global mean warming since preindustrial times. This would require large sustained reductions in carbon dioxide emissions during the twenty-first century and beyond(2-4). Such a global temperature target, however, is not sufficient to control many other quantities, such as transient sea level rise(5), ocean acidification(6,7) and net primary production on land(8,9). Here, using an Earth system model of intermediate complexity (EMIC) in an observation-informed Bayesian approach, we show that allowable carbon emissions are substantially reduced when multiple climate targets are set. We take into account uncertainties in physical and carbon cycle model parameters, radiative efficiencies(10), climate sensitivity(11) and carbon cycle feedbacks(12,13) along with a large set of observational constraints. Within this framework, we explore a broad range of economically feasible greenhouse gas scenarios from the integrated assessment community(14-17) to determine the likelihood of meeting a combination of specific global and regional targets under various assumptions. For any given likelihood of meeting a set of such targets, the allowable cumulative emissions are greatly reduced from those inferred from the temperature target alone. Therefore, temperature targets alone are unable to comprehensively limit the risks from anthropogenic emissions.","[Steinacher, Marco; Joos, Fortunat; Stocker, Thomas F.] Univ Bern, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Steinacher, Marco; Joos, Fortunat; Stocker, Thomas F.] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland","Steinacher, M (reprint author), Univ Bern, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",steinacher@climate.unibe.ch,"Steinacher, Marco/J-1527-2012; Stocker, Thomas/B-1273-2013","Steinacher, Marco/0000-0002-4795-1749; Joos, Fortunat/0000-0002-9483-6030","Swiss National Science Foundation; European Commission [EPOCA 211384, 264879]","We thank T.

On short timescales (annual or shorter) the non-tidal component is dominated by the atmosphere, with small contributions from the ocean and hydrological system. On decadal timescales, the dominant contribution is from angular momentum exchange between the solid mantle and fluid outer core. Intradecadal periods have been less clear and have been characterized by signals with a wide range of periods and varying amplitudes, including a peak at about 6 years (refs 2-4). Here, by working in the time domain rather than the frequency domain, we show a clear partition of the non-atmospheric component into only three components: a decadally varying trend, a 5.9-year period oscillation, and jumps at times contemporaneous with geomagnetic jerks. The nature of the jumps in length of day leads to a fundamental change in what class of phenomena may give rise to the jerks, and provides a strong constraint on electrical conductivity of the lower mantle, which can in turn constrain its structure and composition.","[Holme, R.] Univ Liverpool, Sch Environm Sci, Liverpool L69 3GP, Merseyside, England; [de Viron, O.] Univ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cit, Inst Phys Globe, UMR7154, F-75013 Paris, France","Holme, R (reprint author), Univ Liverpool, Sch Environm Sci, Liverpool L69 3GP, Merseyside, England.",holme@liv.ac.uk,"de Viron, Olivier/N-6647-2014","de Viron, Olivier/0000-0003-3112-9686","Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) through the TOSCA (Terre, Ocean, Surfaces Continentales, Atmosphere) programme; French Institut Universitaire de France; National Oceanographic Partnership Program","O.d.V. was supported by Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) through the TOSCA (Terre, Ocean, Surfaces Continentales, Atmosphere) programme, and by the French Institut Universitaire de France.

Anaerobic metabolismof amino acids, carbohydrates and lipids seem to be the dominant metabolic processes, and profiles of dissimilatory sulfite reductase (dsr) transcripts are consistent with pore-water sulphate concentration profiles(1). Moreover, transcripts involved in cell division increase as a function of microbial cell concentration, indicating that increases in sub-seafloor microbial abundance are a function of cell division across all three domains of life.

These marine phytoplankton can account for 20 per cent of total carbon fixation in some systems(2). They form blooms that can occupy hundreds of thousands of square kilometres and are distinguished by their elegantly sculpted calcium carbonate exoskeletons (coccoliths), rendering them visible from space(3). Although coccolithophores export carbon in the form of organic matter and calcite to the sea floor, they also release CO2 in the calcification process. Hence, they have a complex influence on the carbon cycle, driving either CO2 production or uptake, sequestration and export to the deep ocean(4). Here we report the first haptophyte reference genome, from the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi strain CCMP1516, and sequences from 13 additional isolates. Our analyses reveal a pan genome (core genes plus genes distributed variably between strains) probably supported by an atypical complement of repetitive sequence in the genome. Comparisons across strains demonstrate that E. huxleyi, which has long been considered a single species, harbours extensive genome variability reflected in different metabolic repertoires.

These studies involve the sequencing of matched tumour-normal samples followed by mathematical analysis to identify those genes in which mutations occur more frequently than expected by random chance. Here we describe a fundamental problem with cancer genome studies: as the sample size increases, the list of putatively significant genes produced by current analytical methods burgeons into the hundreds. The list includes many implausible genes (such as those encoding olfactory receptors and the muscle protein titin), suggesting extensive false-positive findings that overshadow true driver events. We show that this problem stems largely from mutational heterogeneity and provide a novel analytical methodology, MutSigCV, for resolving the problem. We apply MutSigCV to exome sequences from 3,083 tumour-normal pairs and discover extraordinary variation in mutation frequency and spectrum within cancer types, which sheds light on mutational processes and disease aetiology, and in mutation frequency across the genome, which is strongly correlated with DNA replication timing and also with transcriptional activity. By incorporating mutational heterogeneity into the analyses, MutSigCV is able to eliminate most of the apparent artefactual findings and enable the identification of genes truly associated with cancer.","[Lawrence, Michael S.; Stojanov, Petar; Polak, Paz; Kryukov, Gregory V.; Cibulskis, Kristian; Sivachenko, Andrey; Carter, Scott L.; Stewart, Chip; Mermel, Craig H.; Kiezun, Adam; Hammerman, Peter S.; McKenna, Aaron; Drier, Yotam; Zou, Lihua; Ramos, Alex H.; Pugh, Trevor J.; Stransky, Nicolas; Helman, Elena; Kim, Jaegil; Sougnez, Carrie; Ambrogio, Lauren; Nickerson, Elizabeth; Shefler, Erica; Cortes, Maria L.; Auclair, Daniel; Saksena, Gordon; Voet, Douglas; Noble, Michael; DiCara, Daniel; Lin, Pei; Lichtenstein, Lee; Heiman, David I.; Fennell, Timothy; Imielinski, Marcin; Hernandez, Bryan; Hodis, Eran; Baca, Sylvan; Dulak, Austin M.; Lohr, Jens; Landau, Dan-Avi; Koren, Amnon; McCarroll, Steven A.; Onofrio, Robert; Parkin, Melissa; Winckler, Wendy; Ardlie, Kristin; Gabriel, Stacey B.; Stegmaier, Kimberly; Bass, Adam J.; Garraway, Levi A.; Meyerson, Matthew; Golub, Todd R.; Sunyaev, Shamil; Lander, Eric S.; Getz, Gad] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02141 USA; [Stojanov, Petar; Hammerman, Peter S.; Pugh, Trevor J.; Hodis, Eran; Baca, Sylvan; Dulak, Austin M.; Lohr, Jens; Landau, Dan-Avi; Wu, Catherine J.; Lee, Ryan S.; Crompton, Brian; Roberts, Charles W.

Perturbations to the gut ecosystem, such as through antibiotic treatment or diet, are at present interpreted at the level of bacterial phylogeny(5-7). Less is known about the contributions of the abundant population of phages to this ecological network. Here we explore the phageome as a potential genetic reservoir for bacterial adaptation by sequencing murine faecal phage populations following antibiotic perturbation. We show that antibiotic treatment leads to the enrichment of phage-encoded genes that confer resistance via disparate mechanisms to the administered drug, as well as genes that confer resistance to antibiotics unrelated to the administered drug, and we demonstrate experimentally that phages from treated mice provide aerobically cultured naive microbiota with increased resistance. Systems-wide analyses uncovered post-treatment phage-encoded processes related to host colonization and growth adaptation, indicating that the phageome becomes broadly enriched for functionally beneficial genes under stress-related conditions. We also show that antibiotic treatment expands the interactions between phage and bacterial species, leading to a more highly connected phage-bacterial network for gene exchange. Our work implicates the phageome in the emergence of multidrug resistance, and indicates that the adaptive capacity of the phageome may represent a community-based mechanism for protecting the gut microflora, preserving its functional robustness during antibiotic stress.","[Modi, Sheetal R.; Lee, Henry H.; Spina, Catherine S.; Collins, James J.] Boston Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Modi, Sheetal R.; Lee, Henry H.; Spina, Catherine S.; Collins, James J.] Boston Univ, Ctr BioDynam, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Spina, Catherine S.; Collins, James J.] Boston Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02118 USA; [Spina, Catherine S.; Collins, James J.] Harvard Univ, Wyss Inst Biol Inspired Engn, Boston, MA 02118 USA","Collins, JJ (reprint author), Boston Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",jcollins@bu.edu,,,Howard Hughes Medical Institute; National Institutes of Health Director's Pioneer Award Program,We thank K.

Each parasite has 60 antigenically distinct var genes that each code for a different PfEMP1 protein. During infection the clonal parasite population expresses only one gene at a time before switching to the expression of a new variant antigen as an immune-evasion mechanism to avoid the host antibody response(2,3). The mechanism by which 59 of the 60 var genes are silenced remains largely unknown(4-7). Here we show that knocking out the P. falciparum variant-silencing SET gene (here termed PfSETvs), which encodes an orthologue of Drosophila melanogaster ASH1 and controls histone H3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) on var genes, results in the transcription of virtually all var genes in the single parasite nuclei and their expression as proteins on the surface of individual infected red blood cells. PfSETvs-dependent H3K36me3 is present along the entire gene body, including the transcription start site, to silence var genes. With low occupancy of PfSETvs at both the transcription start site of var genes and the intronic promoter, expression of var genes coincides with transcription of their corresponding antisense long noncoding RNA. These results uncover a previously unknown role of PfSETvs-dependent H3K36me3 in silencing var genes in P. falciparum that might provide a general mechanism by which orthologues of PfSETvs repress gene expression in other eukaryotes. PfSETvs knockout parasites expressing all PfEMP1 proteins may also be applied to the development of a malaria vaccine.","[Jiang, Lubin; Jing, Qingqing] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Pasteur Shanghai, Unit Human Parasite Mol & Cell Biol, Key Lab Mol Virol & Immunol, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Lubin; Jing, Qingqing] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Biol Sci, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China; [Mu, Jianbing; Srinivasan, Prakash; Rayavara, Kempaiah; Bansal, Abhisheka; Ribeiro, Jose M.

It is unknown why this capacity is limited to the area associated with the nail(2-4). Here we show that nail stem cells (NSCs) reside in the proximal nail matrix and that the mechanisms governing NSC differentiation are coupled directly with their ability to orchestrate digit regeneration. Early nail progenitors undergo Wnt-dependent differentiation into the nail. After amputation, this Wnt activation is required for nail regeneration and also for attracting nerves that promote mesenchymal blastema growth, leading to the regeneration of the digit. Amputations proximal to the Wnt-active nail progenitors result in failure to regenerate the nail or digit. Nevertheless, beta-catenin stabilization in the NSC region induced their regeneration. These results establish a link between NSC differentiation and digit regeneration, and suggest that NSCs may have the potential to contribute to the development of novel treatments for amputees.","[Takeo, Makoto; Chou, Wei Chin; Sun, Qi; Lee, Wendy; Rabbani, Piul; Loomis, Cynthia; Ito, Mayumi] NYU, Sch Med, Ronald O Perelman Dept Dermatol, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Takeo, Makoto; Chou, Wei Chin; Sun, Qi; Lee, Wendy; Rabbani, Piul; Loomis, Cynthia; Ito, Mayumi] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Taketo, M.

Among the seven eukaryotic phosphoinositides the best studied species is phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P-2), which is concentrated at the plasma membrane where, among other functions, it is required for the nucleation of endocytic clathrin-coated pits(3-6). No phosphatidylinositol other than PI(4,5)P-2 has been implicated in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, whereas the subsequent endosomal stages of the endocytic pathway are dominated by phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphates(PI(3)P)(7). How phosphatidylinositol conversion from PI(4,5)P-2-positive endocytic intermediates to PI(3)P-containing endosomes is achieved is unclear. Here we show that formation of phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P-2) by class II phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase C2 alpha (PI(3) K C2 alpha) spatiotemporally controls clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Depletion of PI(3,4)P-2 or PI(3)K C2 alpha impairs the maturation of late-stage clathrin-coated pits before fission. Timed formation of PI(3,4)P-2 by PI(3)K C2 alpha is required for selective enrichment of the BAR domain protein SNX9 at late-stage endocytic intermediates. These findings provide a mechanistic framework for the role of PI(3,4)P-2 in endocytosis and unravel a novel discrete function of PI(3,4)P-2 in a central cell physiological process.","[Posor, York; Eichhorn-Gruenig, Marielle; Puchkov, Dmytro; Lampe, Andre; Krauss, Michael; Schmoranzer, Jan; Haucke, Volker] Leibniz Inst Mol Pharmakol FMP, D-13125 Berlin, Germany; [Posor, York; Eichhorn-Gruenig, Marielle; Puchkov, Dmytro; Lampe, Andre; Krauss, Michael; Schmoranzer, Jan; Haucke, Volker] Free Univ Berlin, D-13125 Berlin, Germany; [Schoeneberg, Johannes; Ullrich, Alexander; Noe, Frank] Free Univ Berlin, DFG Res Ctr MATHEON, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Mueller, Rainer; Zarbakhsh, Sirus; Schultz, Carsten] European Mol Biol Lab, Cell Biol & Biophys Unit, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Gulluni, Federico; Hirsch, Emilio] Univ Turin, Ctr Mol Biotechnol, Dept Genet, I-10126 Turin, Italy; [Gulluni, Federico; Hirsch, Emilio] Univ Turin, Ctr Mol Biotechnol, Dept Biol, I-10126 Turin, Italy; [Gulluni, Federico; Hirsch, Emilio] Univ Turin, Ctr Mol Biotechnol, Dept Biochem, I-10126 Turin, Italy; [Haucke, Volker] Charite, NeuroCure Cluster Excellence, D-10117 Berlin, Germany","Haucke, V (reprint author), Leibniz Inst Mol Pharmakol FMP, Robert Roessle Str 10, D-13125 Berlin, Germany.",haucke@fmp-berlin.de,,"Puchkov, Dmytro/0000-0001-8341-4847; Haucke, Volker/0000-0003-3119-6993; Schultz, Carsten/0000-0002-5824-2171; Hirsch, Emilio/0000-0002-9073-6024","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB 740/C8, SFB 740/D7, SFB 958/A04, SFB 958/A07, SFB 958/Z02]","We thank E.

STIM1 senses depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores in response to physiological stimuli, and relocalizes within the endoplasmic reticulum to plasma-membrane-apposed junctions, where it recruits and gates open plasma membrane ORAI1 Ca2+ channels. Here we use a genome-wide RNA interference screen in HeLa cells to identify filamentous septin proteins as crucial regulators of store-operated Ca2+ entry. Septin filaments and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (also known as PtdIns(4,5)P-2) rearrange locally at endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane junctions before and during formation of STIM1-ORAI1 clusters, facilitating STIM1 targeting to these junctions and promoting the stable recruitment of ORAI1. Septin rearrangement at junctions is required for PtdIns(4,5) P2 reorganization and efficient STIM1-ORAI1 communication. Septins are known to demarcate specialized membrane regions such as dendritic spines, the yeast bud and the primary cilium, and to serve as membrane diffusion barriers and/or signalling hubs in cellular processes such as vesicle trafficking, cell polarity and cytokinesis2-4. Our data show that septins also organize the highly localized plasma membrane domains that are important in STIM1-ORAI1 signalling, and indicate that septins may organize membrane microdomains relevant to other signalling processes.","[Sharma, Sonia; Quintana, Ariel; Rao, Anjana; Hogan, Patrick G.] La Jolla Inst Allergy & Immunol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Sharma, Sonia; Quintana, Ariel; Findlay, Gregory M.; Baust, Beate; Rao, Anjana; Hogan, Patrick G.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Childrens Hosp Boston, Program Cellular & Mol Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Mettlen, Marcel] Scripps Res Inst, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Jain, Mohit] Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Jain, Mohit] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Cardiovasc Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Nilsson, Roland] Karolinska Inst, S-17176 Stockholm, Sweden","Rao, A (reprint author), La Jolla Inst Allergy & Immunol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",arao@liai.org; phogan@liai.org,,"Nilsson, Roland/0000-0002-6020-7498","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [AI040127, AI084167]; NIH [AI092763, K08 HL107451, R01GM73165]; Canadian Institutes for Health Research; Leukemia & Lymphoma Society; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [QU298/1-1]; Knut & Alice Wallenberg Foundation","We thank C.

We surveyed more than 400 tumours using different genomic platforms and identified 19 significantly mutated genes. The PI(3) K/AKT pathway was recurrently mutated, suggesting this pathway as a potential therapeutic target. Widespread DNA hypomethylation was associated with mutation of the H3K36 methyltransferase SETD2, and integrative analysis suggested that mutations involving the SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex (PBRM1, ARID1A, SMARCA4) could have far-reaching effects on other pathways. Aggressive cancers demonstrated evidence of a metabolic shift, involving downregulation of genes involved in the TCA cycle, decreased AMPK and PTEN protein levels, upregulation of the pentose phosphate pathway and the glutamine transporter genes, increased acetyl-CoA carboxylase protein, and altered promoter methylation of miR-21 (also known as MIR21) and GRB10. Remodelling cellular metabolism thus constitutes a recurrent pattern in ccRCC that correlates with tumour stage and severity and offers new views on the opportunities for disease treatment.","[Creighton, Chad J.; Morgan, Margaret; Gunaratne, Preethi H.; Wheeler, David A.; Gibbs, Richard A.; Muzny, Donna; Davis, Caleb; Xi, Liu; Chang, Kyle; Kakkar, Nipun; Trevino, Lisa R.; Benton, Susan; Reid, Jeffrey G.; Morton, Donna; Doddapaneni, Harsha; Han, Yi; Lewis, Lora; Dinh, Huyen; Kovar, Christie; Zhu, Yiming; Santibanez, Jireh; Wang, Min; Hale, Walker; Kalra, Divya] Baylor Coll Med, Human Genome Sequencing Ctr, Houston, TX 77030 USA; Baylor Coll Med, Dan L Duncan Canc Ctr, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Xiao, Weimin] Univ Houston, Dept Biol & Biochem, Houston, TX 77204 USA; [Robertson, A.

To accomplish its function in DNA repair, 53BP1 accumulates at DSB sites downstream of the RNF168 ubiquitin ligase. How ubiquitin recruits 53BP1 to break sites remains unknown as its relocalization involves recognition of histone H4 Lys 20 (H4K20) methylation by its Tudor domain. Here we elucidate how vertebrate 53BP1 is recruited to the chromatin that flanks DSB sites. We show that 53BP1 recognizes mononucleosomes containing dimethylated H4K20 (H4K20me2) and H2A ubiquitinated on Lys 15 (H2AK15ub), the latter being a product of RNF168 action on chromatin. 53BP1 binds to nucleosomes minimally as a dimer using its previously characterized methyl-lysine-binding Tudor domain and a carboxy-terminal extension, termed the ubiquitination-dependent recruitment (UDR) motif, which interacts with the epitope formed by H2AK15ub and its surrounding residues on the H2A tail. 53BP1 is therefore a bivalent histone modification reader that recognizes a histone 'code' produced by DSB signalling.","[Fradet-Turcotte, Amelie; Canny, Marella D.; Escribano-Diaz, Cristina; Orthwein, Alexandre; Leung, Charles C.

Over 95 per cent of such clusters have stellar densities too low (less than a hundred stars per cubic parsec) to withstand internal and external dynamical stresses and fall apart within a few hundred million years(1). Older open clusters have survived by virtue of being richer and denser in stars (1,000 to 10,000 per cubic parsec) when they formed. Such clusters represent a stellar environment very different from the birthplace of the Sun and other planet-hosting field stars. So far more than 800 planets have been found around Sun-like stars in the field(2). The field planets are usually the size of Neptune or smaller(3-5). In contrast, only four planets have been found orbiting stars in open clusters(6-8), all with masses similar to or greater than that of Jupiter. Here we report observations of the transits of two Sun-like stars by planets smaller than Neptune in the billion-year-old open cluster NGC6811. This demonstrates that small planets can form and survive in a dense cluster environment, and implies that the frequency and properties of planets in open clusters are consistent with those of planets around field stars in the Galaxy.","[Meibom, Soren; Torres, Guillermo; Fressin, Francois; Latham, David W.] Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Rowe, Jason F.; Bryson, Steven T.; Henze, Christopher E.; Howell, Steve B.] NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; [Ciardi, David R.] CALTECH, NASA, Exoplanet Sci Inst, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Rogers, Leslie A.] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Janes, Kenneth] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Barnes, Sydney A.] Leibniz Inst Astrophys, D-14467 Potsdam, Germany; [Barnes, Sydney A.] Space Sci Inst, Boulder, CO 80301 USA; [Marcy, Geoffrey W.; Isaacson, Howard] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Fischer, Debra A.] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Horch, Elliott P.] So Connecticut State Univ, New Haven, CT 06515 USA; [Jenkins, Jon M.] NASA, SETI Inst, Ames Res Ctr, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; [Schuler, Simon C.] Natl Opt Astron Observ, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA; [Crepp, Justin] Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA","Meibom, S (reprint author), Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, 60 Garden St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",smeibom@cfa.harvard.edu,,"Ciardi, David/0000-0002-5741-3047; Schuler, Simon/0000-0001-7203-8014; Fischer, Debra/0000-0003-2221-0861","NASA's Science Mission Directorate; NASA [NNX09AH18A, HF-51313.01-A, NAS 5-26555]; Kepler mission via NASA Cooperative Agreement [NCC2-1390]; NASA's Kepler Participating Scientist Program [NNX12AC75G]; Space Telescope Science Institute","Kepler was competitively selected as the tenth Discovery mission.

These terrains have a lower density of craters less than 100 km in diameter than does the Moon(1,3,5), an observation attributed to preferential resurfacing on Mercury. Here we report global crater statistics of Mercury's most heavily cratered terrains on the entire surface. Applying a recent model for early lunar crater chronology(6) and an updated dynamical extrapolation to Mercury(7), we find that the oldest surfaces were emplaced just after the start of the Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB) about 4.0-4.1 Gyr ago. Mercury's global record of large impact basins(8), which has hitherto not been dated, yields a similar surface age. This agreement implies that resurfacing was global and was due to volcanism, as previously suggested(1,5). This activity ended during the tail of the LHB, within about 300-400 million years after the emplacement of the oldest terrains on Mercury. These findings suggest that persistent volcanism could have been aided by the surge of basin-scale impacts during this bombardment.","[Marchi, Simone] NASA, Lunar Sci Inst, SW Res Inst, Boulder, CO 80302 USA; [Chapman, Clark R.; Bottke, W.

Entanglement between photons can produce correlations that result in a reduction of these fluctuations below the ordinary vacuum level, allowing measurements that surpass the standard quantum limit in sensitivity(1-5). The effects of such 'squeezed states' of light on matter were first considered in a prediction(6) of the radiative decay rates of atoms in squeezed vacuum. Despite efforts to demonstrate such effects in experiments with natural atoms(7-9), a direct quantitative observation of this prediction has remained elusive. Here we report a twofold reduction of the transverse radiative decay rate of a superconducting artificial atom coupled to continuum squeezed vacuum. The artificial atom is effectively a two-level system formed by the strong interaction between a superconducting circuit and a microwave-frequency cavity. A Josephson parametric amplifier is used to generate quadrature-squeezed electromagnetic vacuum. The observed twofold reduction in the decay rate of the atom allows the transverse coherence time, T-2, to exceed the ordinary vacuum decay limit, 2T(1). We demonstrate that the measured radiative decay dynamics can be used to reconstruct the Wigner distribution of the itinerant squeezed state. Our results confirm a canonical prediction(6) of quantum optics and should enable new studies of the quantum light-matter interaction.","[Murch, K. W.; Weber, S.

In [FeFe]-hydrogenases, catalysis takes place at a unique di-iron centre (the [2Fe] subsite), which contains a bridging dithiolate ligand, three CO ligands and two CN- ligands(6,7). Through a complex multienzymatic biosynthetic process, this [2Fe] subsite is first assembled on a maturation enzyme, HydF, and then delivered to the apo-hydrogenase for activation(8). Synthetic chemistry has been used to prepare remarkably similar mimics of that subsite(1), but it has failed to reproduce the natural enzymatic activities thus far. Here we show that three synthetic mimics (containing different bridging dithiolate ligands) can be loaded onto bacterial Thermotoga maritima HydF and then transferred to apo-HydA1, one of the hydrogenases of Chlamy-domonas reinhardtii algae. Full activation of HydA1 was achieved only when using the HydF hybrid protein containing the mimic with an azadithiolate bridge, confirming the presence of this ligand in the active site of native [FeFe]-hydrogenases(9,10). This is an example of controlled metalloenzyme activation using the combination of a specific protein scaffold and active-site synthetic analogues. This simple methodology provides both new mechanistic and structural insight into hydrogenase maturation and a unique tool for producing recombinant wild-type and variant [FeFe]-hydrogenases, with no requirement for the complete maturation machinery.","[Berggren, G.; Simmons, T.

However, it is unclear whether the cause of voluminous melt production at volcanic rifts is primarily increased mantle temperature or plate thinning(1,2,8-12). Also disputed is the extent to which plate stretching or thinning is uniform or varies with depth with the entire continental lithospheric mantle potentially being removed before plate rupture(13-16). Here we show that the extensive magmatism during rifting along the southern Red Sea rift in Afar, a unique region of sub-aerial transition from continental to oceanic rifting, is driven by deep melting of hotter-than-normal asthenosphere. Petrogenetic modelling shows that melts are predominantly generated at depths greater than 80 kilometres, implying the existence of a thick upper thermo-mechanical boundary layer in a rift system approaching the point of plate rupture. Numerical modelling of rift development shows that when breakup occurs at the slow extension rates observed in Afar, the survival of a thick plate is an inevitable consequence of conductive cooling of the lithosphere, even when the underlying asthenosphere is hot. Sustained magmatic activity during rifting in Afar thus requires persistently high mantle temperatures, which would allow melting at high pressure beneath the thick plate. If extensive plate thinning does occur during breakup it must do so abruptly at a late stage, immediately before the formation of the new ocean basin(16).","[Ferguson, D.

Here we present a 1.12-times coverage draft genome from a horse bone recovered from permafrost dated to approximately 560-780 thousand years before present (kyr BP)(2,3). Our data represent the oldest full genome sequence determined so far by almost an order of magnitude. For comparison, we sequenced the genome of a Late Pleistocene horse (43 kyr BP), and modern genomes of five domestic horse breeds (Equus ferus caballus), a Przewalski's horse (E. f. prze-walskii) and a donkey (E. asinus). Our analyses suggest that the Equus lineage giving rise to all contemporary horses, zebras and donkeys originated 4.0-4.5 million years before present (Myr BP), twice the conventionally accepted time to the most recent common ancestor of the genus Equus(4,5). We also find that horse population size fluctuated multiple times over the past 2 Myr, particularly during periods of severe climatic changes. We estimate that the Przewalski's and domestic horse populations diverged 38-72 kyr BP, and find no evidence of recent admixture between the domestic horse breeds and the Przewalski's horse investigated. This supports the contention that Przewalski's horses represent the last surviving wild horse population(6). We find similar levels of genetic variation among Przewalski's and domestic populations, indicating that the former are genetically viable and worthy of conservation efforts. We also find evidence for continuous selection on the immune system and olfaction throughout horse evolution. Finally, we identify 29 genomic regions among horse breeds that deviate from neutrality and show low levels of genetic variation compared to the Przewalski's horse. Such regions could correspond to loci selected early during domestication.","[Orlando, Ludovic; Ginolhac, Aurelien; Schubert, Mikkel; Cappellini, Enrico; Vilstrup, Julia T.; Raghavan, Maanasa; Korneliussen, Thorfinn; Malaspinas, Anna-Sapfo; Stenderup, Jesper; Velazquez, Amhed M.

Although variation and genetic loci responsible for RNA expression levels have been analysed extensively in human populations(1-5), our knowledge is limited regarding the differences in human protein abundance and the genetic basis for this difference. Variation in messenger RNA expression is not a perfect surrogate for protein expression because the latter is influenced by an array of post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, and, empirically, the correlation between protein and mRNA levels is generally modest(6,7). Here we used isobaric tag-based quantitative mass spectrometry to determine relative protein levels of 5,953 genes in lymphoblastoid cell lines from 95 diverse individuals genotyped in the HapMap Project(8,9). We found that protein levels are heritable molecular phenotypes that exhibit considerable variation between individuals, populations and sexes. Levels of specific sets of proteins involved in the same biological process covary among individuals, indicating that these processes are tightly regulated at the protein level. We identified cis-pQTLs (protein quantitative trait loci), including variants not detected by previous transcriptome studies. This study demonstrates the feasibility of high-throughput human proteome quantification that, when integrated with DNA variation and transcriptome information, adds a new dimension to the characterization of gene expression regulation.","[Wu, Linfeng; Candille, Sophie I.; Choi, Yoonha; Xie, Dan; Jiang, Lihua; Li-Pook-Than, Jennifer; Tang, Hua; Snyder, Michael] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Snyder, M (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",huatang@stanford.edu; mpsnyder@stanford.edu,,"Tang, Hua/0000-0002-0177-8864",NIH,We thank S.

These patterns have been the subject of neuroethological studies(1,2), such as electrophysiological characterization of neurons governing prey capture in toads(1,3). However, technical limitations have prevented detailed study of the functional role of these neurons, a common problem for vertebrate organisms. Complexities involved in studies of whole-animal behaviour can be resolved in Drosophila, in which remote activation of brain cells by genetic means(4) enables us to examine the nervous system in freely moving animals to identify neurons that govern a specific behaviour, and then to repeatedly target and manipulate these neurons to characterize their function. Here we show neurons that generate the feeding motor program in Drosophila. We carried out an unbiased screen using remote neuronal activation and identified a critical pair of brain cells that induces the entire feeding sequence when activated. These 'feeding neurons' (here abbreviated to Fdg neurons for brevity) are also essential for normal feeding as their suppression or ablation eliminates sugar-induced feeding behaviour. Activation of a single Fdg neuron induces asymmetric feeding behaviour and ablation of a single Fdg neuron distorts the sugar-induced feeding behaviour to become asymmetric, indicating the direct role of these neurons in shaping motor-program execution. Furthermore, recording neuronal activity and calcium imaging simultaneously during feeding behaviour(5) reveals that the Fdg neurons respond to food presentation, but only in starved flies. Our results demonstrate that Fdg neurons operate firmly within the sensorimotor watershed, downstream of sensory and metabolic cues and at the top of the feeding motor hierarchy, to execute the decision to feed.","[Flood, Thomas F.; Iguchi, Shinya; Gorczyca, Michael; Yoshihara, Motojiro] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [White, Benjamin] NIMH, Mol Biol Lab, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Ito, Kei] Univ Tokyo, Inst Mol & Cellular Biosci, Tokyo 1130032, Japan","Yoshihara, M (reprint author), Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Worcester, MA 01605 USA.",Motojiro.Yoshihara@umassmed.edu,,,National Institute of Mental Health [MH85958]; Worcester Foundation; National Institute of Mental Health Intramural Research Program; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science/National Science Foundation; Japan Science and Technology Agency CREST grant,"We thank S.

The low efficiency and heterogeneity of most methods have hindered understanding of the precise molecular mechanisms promoting, and roadblocks preventing, efficient reprogramming. Although several intermediate populations have been described(1-7), it has proved difficult to characterize the rare, asynchronous transition from these intermediate stages to iPS cells. The rapid expansion of minor reprogrammed cells in the heterogeneous population can also obscure investigation of relevant transition processes. Understanding the biological mechanisms essential for successful iPS cell generation requires both accurate capture of cells undergoing the reprogramming process and identification of the associated global gene expression changes. Here we demonstrate that in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, reprogramming follows an orderly sequence of stage transitions, marked by changes in the cell-surface markers CD44 and ICAM1, and a Nanog-enhanced green fluorescent protein (Nanog-eGFP) reporter. RNA-sequencing analysis of these populations demonstrates two waves of pluripotency gene upregulation, and unexpectedly, transient upregulation of several epidermis-related genes, demonstrating that reprogramming is not simply the reversal of the normal developmental processes. This novel high-resolution analysis enables the construction of a detailed reprogramming route map, and the improved understanding of the reprogramming process will lead to new reprogramming strategies.","[O'Malley, James; Iwabuchi, Kumiko A.; Chantzoura, Eleni; Ruetz, Tyson; Tomlinson, Simon R.; Kaji, Keisuke] Univ Edinburgh, MRC Ctr Regenerat Med, Edinburgh BioQuarter, Edinburgh EH16 4UU, Midlothian, Scotland; [Skylaki, Stavroula] Helmholtz Ctr Munich, Stem Cell Dynam Res Unit, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany; [Johnsson, Anna; Linnarsson, Sten] Karolinska Inst, Dept Med Biochem & Biophys, Lab Mol Neurobiol, SE-17177 Stockholm, Sweden","Kaji, K (reprint author), Univ Edinburgh, MRC Ctr Regenerat Med, Edinburgh BioQuarter, 5 Little France Dr, Edinburgh EH16 4UU, Midlothian, Scotland.",keisuke.kaji@ed.ac.uk,,,ERC grant ROADTOIPS [261075]; ERC grant BRAINCELL [261063]; Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology Clinic; MRC PhD Studentship; Darwin Trust of Edinburgh Scholarship,"We thank A.

Glucocorticoids stimulate red blood cell formation by promoting self-renewal of early burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) progenitors(1-4). Here we show that the RNA-binding protein ZFP36L2 is a transcriptional target of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in BFU-Es and is required for BFU-E self-renewal. ZFP36L2 is normally downregulated during erythroid differentiation from the BFU-E stage, but its expression is maintained by all tested GR agonists that stimulate BFU-E self-renewal, and the GR binds to several potential enhancer regions of ZFP36L2. Knockdown of ZFP36L2 in cultured BFU-E cells did not affect the rate of cell division but disrupted glucocorticoid-induced BFU-E self-renewal, and knockdown of ZFP36L2 in transplanted erythroid progenitors prevented expansion of erythroid lineage progenitors normally seen following induction of anaemia by phenylhydrazine treatment. ZFP36L2 preferentially binds to messenger RNAs that are induced or maintained at high expression levels during terminal erythroid differentiation and negatively regulates their expression levels. ZFP36L2 therefore functions as part of a molecular switch promoting BFU-E self-renewal and a subsequent increase in the total numbers of colony-forming unit-erythroid (CFU-E) progenitors and erythroid cells that are generated.","[Zhang, Lingbo; Prak, Lina; Rayon-Estrada, Violeta; Thiru, Prathapan; Flygare, Johan; Lodish, Harvey F.] MIT, Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Zhang, Lingbo; Prak, Lina; Rayon-Estrada, Violeta; Thiru, Prathapan; Flygare, Johan; Lodish, Harvey F.] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Zhang, Lingbo; Lim, Bing; Lodish, Harvey F.] Singapore Massachusetts Inst Technol Alliance, Singapore 117576, Singapore; [Zhang, Lingbo; Lim, Bing] ASTAR, Genome Inst Singapore, Singapore 138627, Singapore; [Lim, Bing] Harvard Univ, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Lodish, HF (reprint author), MIT, Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",lodish@wi.mit.edu,"Flygare, Johan/C-6584-2014","Flygare, Johan/0000-0002-1962-5276",NIH [P01 HL 32262]; Singapore-Massachusetts Institute of Technology Alliance,"This work is supported by NIH grant P01 HL 32262 to H.

As the worldwide obesity epidemic has shown no signs of abating(2), better understanding of the mechanisms underlying obesity-associated cancer is urgently needed. Although several events were proposed to be involved in obesity-associated cancer1,3, the exact molecular mechanisms that integrate these events have remained largely unclear. Here we show that senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP)(4,5) has crucial roles in promoting obesity-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in mice. Dietary or genetic obesity induces alterations of gut microbiota, thereby increasing the levels of deoxycholic acid (DCA), a gut bacterial metabolite known to cause DNA damage(6). The enterohepatic circulation of DCA provokes SASP phenotype in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs)(7), which in turn secretes various inflammatory and tumour-promoting factors in the liver, thus facilitating HCC development in mice after exposure to chemical carcinogen. Notably, blocking DCA production or reducing gut bacteria efficiently prevents HCC development in obese mice. Similar results were also observed in mice lacking an SASP inducer(8) or depleted of senescent HSCs, indicating that the DCA-SASP axis in HSCs has key roles in obesity-associated HCC development. Moreover, signs of SASP were also observed in the HSCs in the area of HCC arising in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis(3), indicating that a similar pathway may contribute to at least certain aspects of obesity-associated HCC development in humans as well.

Each year, influenza vaccines must be rapidly produced to match circulating viruses, a process constrained by dated technology and vulnerable to unexpected strains emerging from humans and animal reservoirs. Here we use knowledge of protein structure to design self-assembling nanoparticles that elicit broader and more potent immunity than traditional influenza vaccines. The viral haemagglutinin was genetically fused to ferritin, a protein that naturally forms nanoparticles composed of 24 identical polypeptides(3). Haemagglutinin was inserted at the interface of adjacent subunits so that it spontaneously assembled and generated eight trimeric viral spikes on its surface. Immunization with this influenza nanoparticle vaccine elicited haemagglutination inhibition antibody titres more than tenfold higher than those from the licensed inactivated vaccine. Furthermore, it elicited neutralizing antibodies to two highly conserved vulnerable haemagglutinin structures that are targets of universal vaccines: the stem(4,5) and the receptor binding site on the head(6,7). Antibodies elicited by a 1999 haemagglutinin-nanoparticle vaccine neutralized H1N1 viruses from 1934 to 2007 and protected ferrets from an unmatched 2007 H1N1 virus challenge. This structure-based, self-assembling synthetic nanoparticle vaccine improves the potency and breadth of influenza virus immunity, and it provides a foundation for building broader vaccine protection against emerging influenza viruses and other pathogens.","[Kanekiyo, Masaru; Wei, Chih-Jen; Yassine, Hadi M.; McTamney, Patrick M.; Boyington, Jeffrey C.; Whittle, James R.

Bulk removal of Ca2+ after such signalling events is accomplished by members of the Ca2+: cation (CaCA) superfamily(1-5). The CaCA superfamily includes the Na+/Ca2+ (NCX) and Ca2+/H+ (CAX) antiporters, and in mammals the NCX and related proteins constitute families SLC8 and SLC24, and are responsible for the re-establishment of Ca2+ resting potential in muscle cells, neuronal signalling and Ca2+ reabsorption in the kidney(1,6). The CAX family members maintain cytosolic Ca2+ homeostasis in plants and fungi during steep rises in intracellular Ca2+ due to environmental changes, or following signal transduction caused by events such as hyperosmotic shock, hormone response and response to mating pheromones(7-13). The cytosol-facing conformations within the CaCA superfamily are unknown, and the transport mechanism remains speculative. Here we determine a crystal structure of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae vacuolar Ca2+/H+ exchanger (Vcx1) at 2.3 angstrom resolution in a cytosol-facing, substrate-bound conformation. Vcx1 is the first structure, to our knowledge, within the CAX family, and it describes the key cytosol-facing conformation of the CaCA superfamily, providing the structural basis for a novel alternating access mechanism by which the CaCA superfamily performs high-throughput Ca2+ transport across membranes.","[Waight, Andrew B.; Pedersen, Bjorn Panyella; Chau, Bryant H.; Roe-Zurz, Zygy; Risenmay, Aaron J.; Stroud, Robert M.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem & Biophys, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Schlessinger, Avner; Bonomi, Massimiliano; Sali, Andrej] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Bioengn & Therapeut Sci, Dept Pharmaceut Chem, Calif Inst Quantitat Biosci, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA","Stroud, RM (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem & Biophys, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA.",stroud@msg.ucsf.edu,"Pedersen, Bjorn/H-4128-2017","Pedersen, Bjorn/0000-0001-7860-7230","Carlsberg Foundation; Danish Cancer Society; NIH [U54 GM094625, U01 GM61390, GM24485, GM073210]","We thank J.

Key to the broad functions of FACT is its recognition of histones H2A-H2B (ref. 2). However, the structural basis for how histones H2A-H2B are recognized and how this integrates with the other functions of FACT, including the recognition of histones H3-H4 and other nuclear factors, is unknown. Here we reveal the crystal structure of the evolutionarily conserved FACT chaperone domain Spt16M from Chaetomium thermophilum, in complex with the H2A-H2B heterodimer. A novel 'U-turn' motif scaffolded onto a Rtt106-like module(7-10) embraces the alpha 1 helix of H2B. Biochemical and in vivo assays validate the structure and dissect the contribution of histone tails and H3-H4 towards Spt16M binding. Furthermore, we report the structure of the FACT heterodimerization domain that connects FACT to replicative polymerases. Our results show that Spt16M makes several interactions with histones, which we suggest allow the module to invade the nucleosome gradually and block the strongest interaction of H2B with DNA. FACT would thus enhance 'nucleosome breathing' by re-organizing the first 30 base pairs of nucleosomal histone-DNA contacts. Our snapshot of the engagement of the chaperone with H2A-H2B and the structures of all globular FACT domains enable the high-resolution analysis of the vital chaperoning functions of FACT, shedding light on how the complex promotes the activity of enzymes that require nucleosome reorganization.","[Hondele, Maria; Hassler, Markus; Bowman, Andrew; Kotthoff, Christiane; Ladurner, Andreas G.] Univ Munich, Butenandt Inst, Dept Physiol Chem, D-81377 Munich, Germany; [Hondele, Maria; Hassler, Markus; Bowman, Andrew; Kotthoff, Christiane; Ladurner, Andreas G.] Univ Munich, Fac Med, LMU Biomed Ctr, D-81377 Munich, Germany; [Hondele, Maria; Stuwe, Tobias; Hassler, Markus; Zhang, Elisa T.; Nijmeijer, Bianca; Rybin, Vladimir; Ladurner, Andreas G.] European Mol Biol Lab, Genome Biol Unit, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Hondele, Maria; Stuwe, Tobias; Hassler, Markus; Zhang, Elisa T.; Nijmeijer, Bianca; Rybin, Vladimir; Ladurner, Andreas G.] European Mol Biol Lab, Struct & Computat Biol Unit, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Halbach, Felix] Max Planck Inst Biochem, Dept Struct Cell Biol, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany; [Amlacher, Stefan; Hurt, Ed] Heidelberg Univ, Biochem Ctr, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Ladurner, Andreas G.] Munich Cluster Syst Neurol SyNergy, D-81377 Munich, Germany; [Ladurner, Andreas G.] Ctr Integrated Prot Sci Munich CIPSM, D-81377 Munich, Germany","Ladurner, AG (reprint author), Univ Munich, Butenandt Inst, Dept Physiol Chem, Butenandtstr 5, D-81377 Munich, Germany.",andreas.ladurner@med.lmu.de,,"Nijmeijer-Winter, Bianca/0000-0002-9429-8439; Hassler, Markus/0000-0001-9827-3477; Hondele, Maria/0000-0002-2733-2561",EMBL; LMU Munich; EC FP6 Marie Curie RTN Chromatin Plasticity; Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds,"We thank J.

Moreover, parental type II neuroblasts also sequentially express transcription factors and generate different neuronal/glial progeny over time, providing a second temporal identity axis.

Five transcription factors-Homothorax, Eyeless, Sloppy paired, Dichaete and Tailless-are sequentially expressed in a temporal cascade in each of the medulla neuroblasts as they age. Loss of Eyeless, Sloppy paired or Dichaete blocks further progression of the temporal sequence. We provide evidence that this temporal sequence in neuroblasts, together with Notch-dependent binary fate choice, controls the diversification of the neuronal progeny.

Some low-mass white dwarfs cool rapidly, whereas others stay bright for millions of years because of stable fusion in thick surface hydrogen layers(5). This dichotomy is not well understood, so the potential use of low-mass white dwarfs as independent clocks with which to test the spin-down ages of pulsars(6,7) or as probes of the extreme environments in which low-mass white dwarfs form(8-10) cannot fully be exploited. Here we report precise mass and radius measurements for the precursor to a low-mass white dwarf. We find that only models in which this disrupted red-giant star has a thick hydrogen envelope can match the strong constraints provided by our data. Very cool low-mass white dwarfs must therefore have lost their thick hydrogen envelopes by irradiation from pulsar companions(11,12) or by episodes of unstable hydrogen fusion (shell flashes). We also find that this low-mass white-dwarf precursor is a type of pulsating star not hitherto seen.

In previous studies, hyperfine ground states of single atoms or atomic ensembles have been entangled with spontaneously emitted light(3-6). The probabilistic character of the spontaneous emission process leads to long entanglement generation times, limiting realized network implementations to just two nodes(7-10). The success probability for atom-photon entanglement protocols can be increased by confining a single atom in a high-finesse optical cavity(11,12). Alternatively, quantum networks with superior scaling properties could be achieved using entanglement between light fields and atoms in quantum superpositions of the ground and highly excited (Rydberg) electronic states(2,13,14). Here we report the generation of such entanglement.

For example, silicon devices have enormous potential for photonic integrated circuits on chips compatible with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor devices, with various key elements having been demonstrated in the past decade(1-6). In particular, a focus on the exploitation of the Raman effect has added active optical functionality to pure silicon(7-10), culminating in the realization of a continuous-wave all-silicon laser(11). This achievement is an important step towards silicon photonics, but the desired miniaturization to micrometre dimensions and the reduction of the threshold for laser action to microwatt powers have yet to be achieved: such lasers remain limited to centimetre-sized cavities with thresholds higher than 20 milliwatts(12), even with the assistance of reverse-biased p-i-n diodes. Here we demonstrate a continuous-wave Raman silicon laser using a photonic-crystal, high-quality-factor nanocavity without any p-i-n diodes, yielding a device with a cavity size of less than 10 micrometres and an unprecedentedly low lasing threshold of 1 microwatt. Our nanocavity design exploits the principle that the strength of light-matter interactions is proportional to the ratio of quality factor to the cavity volume and allows drastic enhancement of the Raman gain beyond that predicted theoretically(13,14). Such a device may make it possible to construct practical silicon lasers and amplifiers for large-scale integration in photonic circuits.","[Takahashi, Yasushi; Chihara, Masahiro; Terawaki, Ryo] Osaka Prefecture Univ, Res Org 21st Century, Nanosci & Nanotechnol Res Ctr, Sakai, Osaka 5998570, Japan; [Takahashi, Yasushi] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, PRESTO, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; [Inui, Yoshitaka; Asano, Takashi; Noda, Susumu] Kyoto Univ, Dept Elect Sci & Engn, Kyoto 6158510, Japan; [Noda, Susumu] Kyoto Univ, Photon & Elect Sci & Engn Ctr, Kyoto 6158510, Japan","Takahashi, Y (reprint author), Osaka Prefecture Univ, Res Org 21st Century, Nanosci & Nanotechnol Res Ctr, Sakai, Osaka 5998570, Japan.",y-takahashi@21c.osakafu-u.ac.jp; snoda@kuee.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,,"NanoSquare programme; Funds for the Development of Human Resources in Science and Technology; JST, PRESTO; MEXT KAKENHI [23104721, 21104512]; JSPS KAKENHI [23686015, 20226002]; Asahi Grass Foundation; Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) through its 'Future Pioneering Projects'; CPHoST programme","We especially thank H.

River bedrock erosion and sediment transport are widely recognized to be the principal controls on the lifespan of mountain ranges. But the factors controlling the rate of erosion(4-8) and the reasons why they seem to vary significantly as a function of tectonic activity remain controversial. Here we use computational simulations to show that the key to understanding variations in the rate of erosion between tectonically active and inactive mountain ranges may relate to a bidirectional coupling between bedrock river incision and landslides. Whereas fluvial incision steepens surrounding hillslopes and increases landslide frequency(9), landsliding affects fluvial erosion rates in two fundamentally distinct ways. On the one hand, large landslides overwhelm the river transport capacity and cause upstream build up of sediment that protects the river bed from further erosion(9-11). On the other hand, in delivering abrasive agents to the streams(4-6), landslides help accelerate fluvial erosion. Our models illustrate how this coupling has fundamentally different implications for rates of fluvial incision in active and inactive mountain ranges. The coupling there-fore provides a plausible physical explanation for the preservation of significant mountain-range relief in old orogenic belts, up to several hundred million years after tectonic activity has effectively ceased.","[Egholm, David L.; Knudsen, Mads F.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Geosci, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Sandiford, Mike] Univ Melbourne, Sch Earth Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia","Egholm, DL (reprint author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Geosci, Hoegh Guldbergs Gade 2, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",david@geo.au.dk,"Egholm, David/G-8227-2011; Faurschou Knudsen, Mads /H-4842-2012; Sandiford, Mike/B-5020-2016","Sandiford, Mike/0000-0002-9757-745X; Egholm, David Lundbek/0000-0003-4045-240X; Faurschou Knudsen, Mads/0000-0001-5039-1773",Danish Council for Independent Research under the Sapere Aude programme; Carlsberg Foundation; Villum Foundation; ARC [DP110104098]; AISRF,D.

Such close links between surface geology and deep mantle dynamics presumably operated throughout Earth's history, but are difficult to investigate for past times because the history of mantle flow is poorly known(7). Here we show that the time dependence of global-scale mantle flow can be deduced from the net behaviour of surface plate motions. In particular, we tracked the geographic locations of net convergence and divergence for harmonic degrees 1 and 2 by computing the dipole and quadrupole moments of plate motions from tectonic reconstructions(8,9) extended back to the early Mesozoic era. For present-day plate motions, we find dipole convergence in eastern Asia and quadrupole divergence in both central Africa and the central Pacific. These orientations are nearly identical to the dipole and quadrupole orientations of underlying mantle flow, which indicates that these 'net characteristics' of plate motions reveal deeper flow patterns. The positions of quadrupole divergence have not moved significantly during the past 250 million years, which suggests long-term stability of mantle upwelling beneath Africa and the Pacific Ocean. These upwelling locations are positioned above two compositionally and seismologically distinct(10) regions of the lowermost mantle, which may organize global mantle flow(11) as they remain stationary over geologic time(12).","[Conrad, Clinton P.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, SOEST, Dept Geol & Geophys, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Steinberger, Bernhard] GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, Helmholtz Ctr Potsdam, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Steinberger, Bernhard; Torsvik, Trond H.] Univ Oslo, CEED, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Torsvik, Trond H.] Geol Survey Norway, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Torsvik, Trond H.] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Geosci, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa","Conrad, CP (reprint author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, SOEST, Dept Geol & Geophys, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",clintc@hawaii.edu,,,NSF [EAR-1151241]; ERC [267631],"We are grateful for NSF CAREER grant EAR-1151241 (to C.

Darwin noted that the unique throwing abilities of humans, which were made possible when bipedalism emancipated the arms, enabled foragers to hunt effectively using projectiles(3). However, there has been little consideration of the evolution of throwing in the years since Darwin made his observations, in part because of a lack of evidence of when, how and why hominins evolved the ability to generate high-speed throws(4-8). Here we use experimental studies of humans throwing projectiles to show that our throwing capabilities largely result from several derived anatomical features that enable elastic energy storage and release at the shoulder. These features first appear together approximately 2 million years ago in the species Homo erectus. Taking into consideration archaeological evidence suggesting that hunting activity intensified around this time(9), we conclude that selection for throwing as a means to hunt probably had an important role in the evolution of the genus Homo.","[Roach, Neil T.; Lieberman, Daniel E.] Harvard Univ, Dept Human Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Roach, Neil T.] George Washington Univ, Dept Anthropol, Ctr Adv Study Hominid Paleobiol, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Venkadesan, Madhusudhan] Tata Inst Fundamental Res, Natl Ctr Biol Sci, Bangalore 560065, Karnataka, India; [Rainbow, Michael J.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, Spaulding Natl Running Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Roach, NT (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Human Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",ntroach@email.gwu.edu,"Venkadesan, Madhusudhan/B-4697-2008","Venkadesan, Madhusudhan/0000-0001-5754-7478",National Science Foundation [BCS-0961943]; American School for Prehistoric Research; Wellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance [500158/Z/09/Z],"We would like to thank the Wyss Institute, L.

Anopheles gambiae and Aedes aegypti have evolved a strong preference for humans, making them dangerously efficient vectors of malaria and Dengue haemorrhagic fever(1). Specific host odours probably drive this strong preference because other attractive cues, including body heat and exhaled carbon dioxide (CO2), are common to all warm-blooded hosts(2,3). Insects sense odours via several chemosensory receptor families, including the odorant receptors (ORs), membrane proteins that form heteromeric odour-gated ion channels(4,5) comprising a variable ligand-selective subunit and an obligate co-receptor called Orco (ref. 6). Here we use zinc-finger nucleases to generate targeted mutations in the orco gene of A. aegypti to examine the contribution of Orco and the odorant receptor pathway to mosquito host selection and sensitivity to the insect repellent DEET (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide). orco mutant olfactory sensory neurons have greatly reduced spontaneous activity and lack odour-evoked responses. Behaviourally, orco mutant mosquitoes have severely reduced attraction to honey, an odour cue related to floral nectar, and do not respond to human scent in the absence of CO2. However, in the presence of CO2, female orco mutant mosquitoes retain strong attraction to both human and animal hosts, but no longer strongly prefer humans. orco mutant females are attracted to human hosts even in the presence of DEET, but are repelled upon contact, indicating that olfactory- and contact-mediated effects of DEET are mechanistically distinct. We conclude that the odorant receptor pathway is crucial for an anthropophilic vector mosquito to discriminate human from non-human hosts and to be effectively repelled by volatile DEET.","[DeGennaro, Matthew; McBride, Carolyn S.; Seeholzer, Laura; Nakagawa, Takao; Dennis, Emily J.; Goldman, Chloe; Vosshall, Leslie B.] Rockefeller Univ, Lab Neurogenet & Behav, New York, NY 10065 USA; [DeGennaro, Matthew; Vosshall, Leslie B.] Rockefeller Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Jasinskiene, Nijole; James, Anthony A.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Mol Biol & Biochem, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [James, Anthony A.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Microbiol & Mol Genet & Mol Biol & Biochem, Irvine, CA 92697 USA","Vosshall, LB (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Lab Neurogenet & Behav, New York, NY 10065 USA.",Leslie.Vosshall@rockefeller.edu,,"Vosshall, Leslie/0000-0002-6060-8099; DeGennaro, Matthew/0000-0003-3837-4430","Foundation for the National Institutes of Health through the Grand Challenges in Global Health Initiative; National Institutes of Health [DC012069, AI29746]",We thank K.

CCM lesions are formed by enlarged and irregular blood vessels that often result in cerebral haemorrhages. CCM is caused by loss-of-function mutations in one of three genes, namely CCM1 (also known as KRIT1), CCM2 (OSM) and CCM3 (PDCD10), and occurs in both sporadic and familial forms(1). Recent studies(2-7) have investigated the cause of vascular dysplasia and fragility in CCM, but the in vivo functions of this ternary complex remain unclear(8). Postnatal deletion of any of the three Ccm genes in mouse endothelium results in a severe phenotype, characterized by multiple brain vascular malformations that are markedly similar to human CCM lesions(9). Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) has been described in different pathologies, and it is defined as the acquisition of mesenchymal- and stem-cell-like characteristics by the endothelium(10-12). Here we show that endothelial-specific disruption of the Ccm1 gene in mice induces EndMT, which contributes to the development of vascular malformations. EndMT in CCM1-ablated endothelial cells is mediated by the upregulation of endogenous BMP6 that, in turn, activates the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling pathway. Inhibitors of the TGF-beta and BMP pathway prevent EndMT both in vitro and in vivo and reduce the number and size of vascular lesions in CCM1-deficient mice. Thus, increased TGF-beta and BMP signalling, and the consequent EndMT of CCM1-null endothelial cells, are crucial events in the onset and progression of CCM disease. These studies offer novel therapeutic opportunities for this severe, and so far incurable, pathology.","[Maddaluno, Luigi; Rudini, Noemi; Cuttano, Roberto; Bravi, Luca; Giampietro, Costanza; Corada, Monica; Ferrarini, Luca; Orsenigo, Fabrizio; Papa, Eleanna; Lampugnani, Maria Grazia; Dejana, Elisabetta] IFOM Fdn, FIRC Inst Mol Oncol, I-20139 Milan, Italy; [Boulday, Gwenola; Tournier-Lasserve, Elisabeth] INSERM, UMR S740, F-75010 Paris, France; [Boulday, Gwenola; Tournier-Lasserve, Elisabeth] Univ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Genet Malad Vasc UMR S740, F-75010 Paris, France; [Tournier-Lasserve, Elisabeth] Grp Hosp St Louis Lariboisiere Fernand Widal, AP HP, F-75010 Paris, France; [Chapon, Francoise] CHU Caen, Dept Pathol, F-14032 Caen, France; [Richichi, Cristina] IEO European Inst Oncol, I-20139 Milan, Italy; [Retta, Saverio Francesco] Univ Turin, CCM Italia Dept Clin & Biol Sci, I-10043 Turin, Italy; [Lampugnani, Maria Grazia] Mario Negri Inst Pharmacol Res, I-20156 Milan, Italy; [Dejana, Elisabetta] Univ Milan, Dept Biosci, I-20133 Milan, Italy","Dejana, E (reprint author), IFOM Fdn, FIRC Inst Mol Oncol, I-20139 Milan, Italy.",luigi.maddaluno@ifom.eu; elisabetta.dejana@ifom.eu,"Dejana, Elisabetta/A-6274-2016; Giampietro, Costanza/D-4643-2016; Cuttano, Roberto/B-5884-2017; Tournier-Lasserve, Elisabeth/N-7134-2017","Giampietro, Costanza/0000-0001-5229-3835; Cuttano, Roberto/0000-0003-4150-2114; Tournier-Lasserve, Elisabeth/0000-0002-3039-1677; Lampugnani, Maria Grazia/0000-0002-4802-7064; Boulday, Gwenola/0000-0002-5591-1659; Retta, Saverio Francesco/0000-0001-9761-2959","Fondation Leducq Transatlantic Network of Excellence; Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro (AIRC); 'Special Program Molecular Clinical Oncology 5x1000' to AIRC-Gruppo Italiano Malattie Mieloproliferative (AGIMM); European Community: European Research Council (ERC) [268870, ERC-2010-SdG]; EU [202213, 223098, ENDOSTEM-HEALTH-2009-241440, JUSTBRAIN-HEALTH-2009-241861]; CARIPLO Foundation","This work was supported by grants from: Fondation Leducq Transatlantic Network of Excellence, Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro (AIRC) and a 'Special Program Molecular Clinical Oncology 5x1000' to AIRC-Gruppo Italiano Malattie Mieloproliferative (AGIMM); the European Community: European Research Council (ERC grant 268870 call identifier ERC-2010-SdG) (EU Networks: EUSTROKE-contract-202213, OPTISTEM-contract-223098, ENDOSTEM-HEALTH-2009-241440, ENDOSTEM-HEALTH-2009-241440, JUSTBRAIN-HEALTH-2009-241861, ITN-VESSEL), and the CARIPLO Foundation.

Hence there is great interest to identify potential cellular sources and strategies to generate new ventricular myocardium(3). Past studies have shown that fish and amphibians and early postnatal mammalian ventricular cardiomyocytes can proliferate to help regenerate injured ventricles(4-6); however, recent studies have suggested that additional endogenous cellular sources may contribute to this overall ventricular regeneration(3). Here we have developed, in the zebrafish (Danio rerio), a combination of fluorescent reporter transgenes, genetic fate-mapping strategies and a ventricle-specific genetic ablation system to discover that differentiated atrial cardiomyocytes can transdifferentiate into ventricular cardiomyocytes to contribute to zebrafish cardiac ventricular regeneration. Using in vivo time-lapse and confocal imaging, we monitored the dynamic cellular events during atrial-to-ventricular cardiomyocyte transdifferentiation to define intermediate cardiac reprogramming stages. We observed that Notch signalling becomes activated in the atrial endocardium following ventricular ablation, and discovered that inhibiting Notch signalling blocked the atrial-to-ventricular transdifferentiation and cardiac regeneration. Overall, these studies not only provide evidence for the plasticity of cardiac lineages during myocardial injury, but more importantly reveal an abundant new potential cardiac resident cellular source for cardiac ventricular regeneration.","[Zhang, Ruilin; Han, Peidong; Yang, Hongbo; Ouyang, Kunfu; Lee, Derek; Chen, Ju; Chi, Neil C.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Med, Div Cardiol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Lin, Yi-Fan; Yelon, Deborah] Univ Calif San Diego, Div Biol Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Ocorr, Karen] Sanford Burnham Inst Med Res, Dev & Aging Program, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Kang, Guson; Stainier, Didier Y.

Sequestration is mediated by specific interactions between members of the P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) family and receptors on the endothelial lining(2). Severe childhood malaria is associated with expression of specific PfEMP1 subtypes containing domain cassettes (DCs) 8 and 13 (ref. 3), but the endothelial receptor for parasites expressing these proteins was unknown(4,5). Here we identify endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), which mediates the cytoprotective effects of activated protein C-6, as the endothelial receptor for DC8 and DC13 PfEMP1. We show that EPCR binding is mediated through the amino-terminal cysteine-rich interdomain region (CIDRa1) of DC8 and group A PfEMP1 subfamilies, and that CIDRa1 interferes with protein C binding to EPCR. This PfEMP1 adhesive property links P. falciparum cytoadhesion to a host receptor involved in anticoagulation and endothelial cytoprotective pathways, and has implications for understanding malaria pathology and the development of new malaria interventions.","[Turner, Louise; Lavstsen, Thomas; Berger, Sanne S.; Wang, Christian W.; Petersen, Jens E.

Transcription factors are critical in the generation of cellular diversity, and negative regulators antagonistic to alternate fates often act in conjunction with positive regulators to stabilize lineage commitment(1). Genetic polymorphisms within a single locus encoding the transcription factor BACH2 are associated with numerous autoimmune and allergic diseases including asthma(2), Crohn's disease(3,4), coeliac disease(5), vitiligo(6), multiple sclerosis(7) and type 1 diabetes(8). Although these associations point to a shared mechanism underlying susceptibility to diverse immune-mediated diseases, a function for BACH2 in the maintenance of immune homeostasis has not been established. Here, by studying mice in which the Bach2 gene is disrupted, we define BACH2 as a broad regulator of immune activation that stabilizes immunoregulatory capacity while repressing the differentiation programs of multiple effector lineages in CD4(+) T cells. BACH2 was required for efficient formation of regulatory (T-reg) cells and consequently for suppression of lethal inflammation in a manner that was T-reg-cell-dependent. Assessment of the genome-wide function of BACH2, however, revealed that it represses genes associated with effector cell differentiation. Consequently, its absence during T-reg polarization resulted in inappropriate diversion to effector lineages. In addition, BACH2 constrained full effector differentiation within T(H)1, T(H)2 and T(H)17 cell lineages. These findings identify BACH2 as a key regulator of CD4(+) T-cell differentiation that prevents inflammatory disease by controlling the balance between tolerance and immunity.","[Roychoudhuri, Rahul; Clever, David; Klebanoff, Christopher A.; Yu, Zhiya; Rao, Mahadev; Muranski, Pawel; Crompton, Joseph G.; Gattinoni, Luca; Restifo, Nicholas P.] NCI, Ctr Canc Res, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Hirahara, Kiyoshi; Bonelli, Michael; Sciume, Giuseppe; Vahedi, Golnaz; Takahashi, Hayato; Kanno, Yuka; O'Shea, John J.] NIAMSD, Mol Immunol & Inflammat Branch, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Mousavi, Kambiz; Zare, Hossein; Sartorelli, Vittorio] NIAMS, Lab Muscle Stem Cells & Gene Regulat, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Dema, Barbara; Rivera, Juan] NIAMS, Lab Mol Immunogenet, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Liu, Hui; Bedognetti, Davide; Wang, Ena; Marincola, Francesco M.] NIH, Dept Transfus Med, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Punkosdy, George] NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Hoffmann, Victoria] NIH, Div Vet Resources, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Marincola, Francesco M.] Sidra Med & Res Ctr, Doha, Qatar; [Nakamura, Atsushi; Muto, Akihiko; Igarashi, Kazuhiko] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Biochem, Sendai, Miyagi 9808575, Japan; [Muto, Akihiko; Igarashi, Kazuhiko] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, CREST, Sendai, Miyagi 9808575, Japan; [Restifo, Nicholas P.] NIH, Ctr Regenerat Med, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Roychoudhuri, R (reprint author), NCI, Ctr Canc Res, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",roychoudhuri@mail.nih.gov; osheajo@mail.nih.gov; restifo@nih.gov,"Gattinoni, Luca/A-2281-2008; Roychoudhuri, Rahul/A-7442-2010; Kanno, Yuka/B-5802-2013; Sciume, Giuseppe/K-8985-2016; Hirahara, Kiyoshi/E-2460-2017","Gattinoni, Luca/0000-0003-2239-3282; Roychoudhuri, Rahul/0000-0002-5392-1853; Sciume, Giuseppe/0000-0003-0131-512X; Hirahara, Kiyoshi/0000-0002-9128-9449; Kanno, Yuka/0000-0001-5668-9319; Restifo, Nicholas P./0000-0003-4229-4580; Bedognetti, Davide/0000-0002-5857-773X; Igarashi, Kazuhiko/0000-0002-2470-2475",Intramural Research Programs of the National Cancer Institute (NIH); National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases; NIH Center for Regenerative Medicine; JSPS Research Fellowship for Japanese Biomedical and Behavioural Researchers at NIH,"This research was supported by the Intramural Research Programs of the National Cancer Institute (NIH) and the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, the NIH Center for Regenerative Medicine and the JSPS Research Fellowship for Japanese Biomedical and Behavioural Researchers at NIH.

Rev-Erbs function as transcriptional repressors by recruiting nuclear receptor co-repressor (NCoR)-HDAC3 complexes to Rev-Erb response elements in enhancers and promoters of target genes(6-8), but the molecular basis for cell-specific programs of repressionis not known. Here we present evidence that in mouse macrophages Rev-Erbs regulate target gene expression by inhibiting the functions of distal enhancers that are selected by macrophage-lineage-determining factors, thereby establishing a macrophage-specific program of repression. Remarkably, the repressive functions of Rev-Erbs are associated with their ability to inhibit the transcription of enhancer-derived RNAs (eRNAs). Furthermore, targeted degradation of eRNAs at two enhancers subject to negative regulation by Rev-Erbs resulted in reduced expression of nearby messenger RNAs, suggesting a direct role of these eRNAs in enhancer function. By precisely defining eRNA start sites using a modified form of global run-on sequencing that quantifies nascent 5' ends, we show that transfer of full enhancer activity to a target promoter requires both the sequences mediating transcription-factor binding and the specific sequences encoding the eRNA transcript. These studies provide evidence for a direct role of eRNAs in contributing to enhancer functions and suggest that Rev-Erbs act to suppress gene expression at a distance by repressing eRNA transcription.","[Lam, Michael T.

In addition to widespread transcription of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in mammalian cells(4-6), bidirectional ncRNAs are transcribed on enhancers, and are thus referred to as enhancer RNAs (eRNAs)(7-9). However, it has remained unclear whether these eRNAs are functional or merely a reflection of enhancer activation. Here we report that in human breast cancer cells 17 beta-oestradiol (E2)-bound oestrogen receptor alpha (ER-alpha) causes a global increase in eRNA transcription on enhancers adjacent to E2-upregulated coding genes. These induced eRNAs, as functional transcripts, seem to exert important roles for the observed ligand-dependent induction of target coding genes, increasing the strength of specific enhancer-promoter looping initiated by ER-alpha binding. Cohesin, present on many ER-alpha-regulated enhancers even before ligand treatment, apparently contributes to E2-dependent gene activation, at least in part by stabilizing E2/ER-alpha/eRNA-induced enhancer-promoter looping. Our data indicate that eRNAs are likely to have important functions in many regulated programs of gene transcription.","[Li, Wenbo; Notani, Dimple; Ma, Qi; Tanasa, Bogdan; Nunez, Esperanza; Chen, Aaron Yun; Merkurjev, Daria; Zhang, Jie; Ohgi, Kenneth; Song, Xiaoyuan; Oh, Soohwan; Kim, Hong-Sook; Rosenfeld, Michael G.] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Dept Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Ma, Qi; Merkurjev, Daria] Univ Calif San Diego, Grad Program Bioinformat, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Tanasa, Bogdan] Scripps Res Inst, Kellogg Sch Sci & Technol, Grad Program, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Oh, Soohwan] Univ Calif San Diego, Grad Program Biol Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Glass, Christopher K.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Rosenfeld, MG (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Dept Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",mrosenfeld@ucsd.edu,"Song, Xiaoyuan/P-1094-2014; Ma, Qi/C-9716-2015","Song, Xiaoyuan/0000-0002-9011-5033; Glass, Christopher/0000-0003-4344-3592","UCSD Cancer Center [P30 CA23100]; Department of Defense (DoD) [BC110381, BC103858]; DoD;  [DK 039949];  [DK018477];  [NS034934];  [HL065445];  [CA173903]","We thank K.

We wanted to examine the structural solution that the viroporin adopts in order to achieve selective cation conduction, because p7 has no homology with any of the known prokaryotic or eukaryotic channel proteins. The activity of p7 can be inhibited by amantadine and rimantadine(2,5), which are potent blockers of the influenza M2 channel(6) and licensed drugs against influenza infections(7). The adamantane derivatives have been used in HCV clinical trials(8), but large variation in drug efficacy among the various HCV genotypes has been difficult to explain without detailed molecular structures. Here we determine the structures of this HCV viroporin as well as its drug-binding site using the latest nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technologies. The structure exhibits an unusual mode of hexameric assembly, where the individual p7 monomers, i, not only interact with their immediate neighbours, but also reach farther to associate with the i+2 and i+3 monomers, forming a sophisticated, funnel-like architecture. The structure also points to a mechanism of cation selection: an asparagine/histidine ring that constricts the narrow end of the funnel serves as a broad cation selectivity filter, whereas an arginine/lysine ring that defines the wide end of the funnel may selectively allow cation diffusion into the channel. Our functional investigation using whole-cell channel recording shows that these residues are critical for channel activity. NMR measurements of the channel-drug complex revealed six equivalent hydrophobic pockets between the peripheral and pore-forming helices to which amantadine or rimantadine binds, and compound binding specifically to this position may allosterically inhibit cation conduction by preventing the channel from opening. Our data provide a molecular explanation for p7-mediated cation conductance and its inhibition by adamantane derivatives.","[OuYang, Bo; Berardi, Marcelo J.; Dev, Jyoti; Chou, James J.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem & Mol Pharmacol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [OuYang, Bo; Chou, James J.] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Biochem & Cell Biol, State Key Lab Mol Biol, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China; [OuYang, Bo; Chou, James J.] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Biochem & Cell Biol, Natl Ctr Prot Sci, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China; [Xie, Shiqi; Zhao, Xinhao; Yu, Wenjing; Sun, Bing] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Biol Sci, Inst Pasteur Shanghai, Mol Virus Unit,Key Lab Mol Virol & Immunol, Shanghai 200025, Peoples R China; [Sun, Bing] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Biochem & Cell Biol, State Key Lab Cell Biol, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China","Chou, JJ (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem & Mol Pharmacol, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",bsun@sibs.ac.cn; chou@cmcd.hms.harvard.edu,"Chou, James/N-9840-2013; Dev, Jyoti/I-4109-2016","Dev, Jyoti/0000-0002-9217-7406; Xie, Shiqi/0000-0002-0516-3621",National Key Project of 973 [2013CB530504]; National Science and Technology Major Project [2012ZX10002-007-003]; NIH [GM094608],"We thank R.

The modulators currently used for holographic video displays are challenging to use for several reasons: they have relatively low bandwidth, high cost, low diffraction angle, poor scalability, and the presence of quantization noise, unwanted diffractive orders and zero-order light. Here we present modulators for holographic video displays based on anisotropic leaky-mode couplers, which have the potential to address all of these challenges. These modulators can be fabricated simply, monolithically and at low cost. Additionally, these modulators are capable of new functionalities, such as wavelength division multiplexing for colour display. We demonstrate three enabling properties of particular interest-polarization rotation, enlarged angular diffraction, and frequency domain colour filtering-and suggest that this technology can be used as a platform for low-cost, high-performance holographic video displays.","[Smalley, D.

Here we show that two distinct mutations in the (uro) chordate-specific gumby (also called Fam105b) gene cause an embryonic angiogenic phenotype in gumby mice. Gumby interacts with disheveled 2 (DVL2), is expressed in canonical Wnt-responsive endothelial cells and encodes an ovarian tumour domain class of deubiquitinase that specifically cleaves linear ubiquitin linkages. A crystal structure of gumby in complex with linear diubiquitin reveals how the identified mutations adversely affect substrate binding and catalytic function in line with the severity of their angiogenic phenotypes. Gumby interacts with HOIP (also called RNF31), a key component of the linear ubiquitin assemblycomplex, and decreases linear ubiquitination and activation of NF-kappa B-dependent transcription.

We have developed a strategy to identify therapeutic entry points for such neurodegenerative disorders by screening for genetic networks that influence the levels of disease-driving proteins. We applied this approach, which integrates parallel cell-based and Drosophila genetic screens, to spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), a disease caused by expansion of a polyglutamine tract in ataxin 1 (ATXN1). Our approach revealed that downregulation of several components of the RAS-MAPK-MSK1 pathway decreases ATXN1 levels and suppresses neurodegeneration in Drosophila and mice. Importantly, pharmacological inhibitors of components of this pathway also decrease ATXN1 levels, suggesting that these components represent new therapeutic targets in mitigating SCA1. Collectively, these data reveal new therapeutic entry points for SCA1 and provide a proof-of-principle for tackling other classes of intractable neurodegenerative diseases.","[Park, Jeehye; Al-Ramahi, Ismael; Tan, Qiumin; Diaz-Garcia, Javier R.; Gallego-Flores, Tatiana; Kang, Hyojin; Lee, Yoontae; Jafar-Nejad, Paymaan; Sayegh, Layal S.; Richman, Ronald; Liu, Xiuyun; Gao, Yan; Shaw, Chad A.; Westbrook, Thomas F.; Botas, Juan; Zoghbi, Huda Y.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Human Genet, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Park, Jeehye; Al-Ramahi, Ismael; Tan, Qiumin; Diaz-Garcia, Javier R.; Gallego-Flores, Tatiana; Lu, Hsiang-Chih; Kang, Hyojin; Lee, Yoontae; Jafar-Nejad, Paymaan; Sayegh, Layal S.; Richman, Ronald; Liu, Xiuyun; Gao, Yan; Botas, Juan; Zoghbi, Huda Y.] Texas Childrens Hosp, Jan & Dan Duncan Neurol Res Inst, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Park, Jeehye; Tan, Qiumin; Lee, Yoontae; Richman, Ronald; Liu, Xiuyun; Zoghbi, Huda Y.] Baylor Coll Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Mollema, Nissa; Lagalwar, Sarita; Duvick, Lisa; Orr, Harry T.] Univ Minnesota, Inst Translat Neurosci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Mollema, Nissa; Lagalwar, Sarita; Duvick, Lisa; Orr, Harry T.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Lab Med & Pathol, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Lu, Hsiang-Chih; Westbrook, Thomas F.; Zoghbi, Huda Y.] Baylor Coll Med, Program Dev Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Arthur, J.

Here we report the crystal structure of cGAS alone and in complex with DNA, ATP and GTP along with functional studies. Our results explain the broad DNA sensing specificity of cGAS, show how cGAS catalyses dinucleotide formation and indicate activation by a DNA-induced structural switch. cGAS possesses a remarkable structural similarity to the antiviral cytosolic double-stranded RNA sensor 2'-5'oligoadenylate synthase (OAS1), but contains a unique zinc thumb that recognizes B-form double-stranded DNA.

Their progenitors are probably the submillimetre bright galaxies(2) at redshifts z greater than 2. Although the mean molecular gas mass(3) (5 x 10(10) solar masses) of the submillimetre bright galaxies can explain the formation of typical elliptical galaxies, it is inadequate to form elliptical galaxies(4) that already have stellar masses above 2 x 10(11) solar masses at z approximate to 2. Here we report multi-wavelength high-resolution observations of a rare merger of two massive submillimetre bright galaxies at z approximate to 2.3. The system is seen to be forming stars at a rate of 2,000 solar masses per year. The star-formation efficiency is an order of magnitude greater than that of normal galaxies, so the gas reservoir will be exhausted and star formation will be quenched in only around 200 million years. At a projected separation of 19 kiloparsecs, the two massive starbursts are about to merge and form a passive elliptical galaxy with a stellar mass of about 4 x 10(11) solar masses. We conclude that gas-rich major galaxy mergers with intense star formation can form the most massive elliptical galaxies by z approximate to 1.5.","[Fu, Hai; Cooray, Asantha; Boylan-Kolchin, M.; Calanog, J.

They are chemically and texturally similar to terrestrial basalts and cumulates, except that they have higher concentrations of iron and volatile elements such as phosphorus and chlorine and lower concentrations of nickel and other chalcophile (sulphur-loving) elements(3). Most Martian meteorites have relatively young crystallization ages (1.4 billion years to 180 million years ago(4)) and are considered to be derived from young, lightly cratered volcanic regions, such as the Tharsis plateau(4,5). Surface rocks from the Gusev crater analysed by the Spirit rover are much older (about 3.7 billion years old(6)) and exhibit marked compositional differences from the meteorites(7). Although also basaltic in composition, the surface rocks are richer in nickel and sulphur and have lower manganese/iron ratios than the meteorites. This has led to doubts that Mars can be described adequately using the 'SNC model'. Here we show, however, that the differences between the compositions of meteorites and surface rocks can be explained by differences in the oxygen fugacity duringmelting of the same sulphur-rich mantle. This ties the sources of Martian meteorites to those of the surface rocks through an early (>3.7 billion years ago) oxidation of the uppermost mantle that had less influence on the deeper regions, which produce the more recent volcanic rocks.","[Tuff, J.; Wade, J.; Wood, B.

Exceedingly neutron-rich nuclei become sensitive to new aspects of nuclear forces(2). Calcium, with its doubly magic isotopes Ca-40 and Ca-48, is an ideal test for nuclear shell evolution, from the valley of stability to the limits of existence. With a closed proton shell, the calcium isotopes mark the frontier for calculations with three-nucleon forces from chiral effective field theory(3-6). Whereas predictions for the masses of Ca-51 and Ca-52 have been validated by direct measurements(4), it is an open question as to how nuclear masses evolve for heavier calcium isotopes. Here we report the mass determination of the exotic calcium isotopes Ca-53 and Ca-54, using the multi-reflection time-of-flight mass spectrometer(7) of ISOLTRAP at CERN. The measured masses unambiguously establish a prominent shell closure at neutron number N = 32, in excellent agreement with our theoretical calculations. These results increase our understanding of neutron-rich matter and pin down the subtle components of nuclear forces that are at the forefront of theoretical developments constrained by quantum chromodynamics(8).","[Wienholtz, F.; George, S.; Rosenbusch, M.; Schweikhard, L.; Wolf, R.

Although in practice this process tends to be heterogeneous, it can occur homogeneously inside bulk ice(1). The thermally induced homogeneous melting of solids is fairly well understood, and involves the formation and growth of melting nuclei(1-5). But in the case of water, resilient hydrogen bonds render ice melting more complex. We know that the first defects appearing during homogeneous ice melting are pairs of five-and seven-membered rings, which appear and disappear repeatedly and randomly in space and time in the crystalline ice structure(6-8). However, the accumulation of these defects to form an aggregate is nearly additive in energy, and results in a steep free energy increase that suppresses further growth. Here we report molecular dynamics simulations of homogeneous ice melting that identify as a crucial first step not the formation but rather the spatial separation of a defect pair. We find that once it is separated, the defect pair-either an interstitial (I) and a vacancy (V) defect pair (a Frenkel pair), or an L and a D defect pair (a Bjerrum pair)(9) - is entropically stabilized, or 'entangled'. In this state, defects with threefold hydrogen-bond coordination persist and grow, and thereby prepare the system for subsequent rapid melting.","[Mochizuki, Kenji] Grad Univ Adv Studies SOKENDAI, Sch Phys Sci, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan; [Matsumoto, Masakazu] Okayama Univ, Grad Sch Nat Sci & Technol, Okayama 7008530, Japan; [Ohmine, Iwao] Natl Inst Nat Sci, Inst Mol Sci, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan","Mochizuki, K (reprint author), Grad Univ Adv Studies SOKENDAI, Sch Phys Sci, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan.",kmochi@ims.ac.jp,"MATSUMOTO, Masakazu/B-1495-2011","Matsumoto, Masakazu/0000-0002-6799-6813",,,,26,19,19,4,86,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,20-Jun,2013,498,7454,,,,,350,354,,10.1038/nature12190,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,166XI,WOS:000320592900037,23783630.0,No,,,11/20/17,iwao,ohmine,na,na,na,na,na

The freezing of cloud droplets can be catalysed by the presence of aerosol particles known as ice nuclei(2). One of the most important ice nuclei is thought to be mineral dust aerosol from arid regions(2,3). It is generally assumed that clay minerals, which contribute approximately two-thirds of the dust mass, dominate ice nucleation by mineral dust, and many experimental studies have therefore focused on these materials(1,2,4-6). Here we use an established droplet-freezing technique(4,7) to show that feldspar minerals dominate ice nucleation by mineral dusts under mixed-phase cloud conditions, despite feldspar being a minor component of dust emitted from arid regions. We also find that clay minerals are relatively unimportant ice nuclei. Our results from a global aerosol model study suggest that feldspar ice nuclei are globally distributed and that feldspar particles may account for a large proportion of the ice nuclei in Earth's atmosphere that contribute to freezing at temperatures below about -15 degrees C.","[Atkinson, James D.; Murray, Benjamin J.; Woodhouse, Matthew T.; Whale, Thomas F.; Baustian, Kelly J.; Carslaw, Kenneth S.; Dobbie, Steven; O'Sullivan, Daniel; Malkin, Tamsin L.] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Inst Climate & Atmospher Sci, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England","Murray, BJ (reprint author), Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Inst Climate & Atmospher Sci, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",b.j.murray@leeds.ac.uk,"Atkinson, James/D-1668-2011; Woodhouse, Matthew/E-4808-2013; Murray, Benjamin/C-1219-2010; Carslaw, Ken/C-8514-2009; Malkin, Tamsin /C-9514-2011; O'Sullivan, Daniel/G-3884-2012","Woodhouse, Matthew/0000-0002-9892-4492; Murray, Benjamin/0000-0002-8198-8131; Carslaw, Ken/0000-0002-6800-154X; Malkin, Tamsin /0000-0001-7314-0870; O'Sullivan, Daniel/0000-0002-6884-8046","European Research Council [240449 ICE]; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/I013466/1, NE/I020059/1, NE/I019057/1]; Royal Society","We thank J.

To link identified neuron types with network and behavioural functions, we recorded from the two largest genetically defined inhibitory interneuron classes, the perisomatically targeting parvalbumin (PV) and the dendritically targeting somatostatin (SOM) neurons(5-8) in anterior cingulate cortex of mice performing a reward foraging task. Here we show that PV and a subtype of SOM neurons form functionally homogeneous populations showing a double dissociation between both their inhibitory effects and behavioural correlates. Out of several events pertaining to behaviour, a subtype of SOM neurons selectively responded at reward approach, whereas PV neurons responded at reward leaving and encoded preceding stay duration. These behavioural correlates of PV and SOM neurons defined a behavioural epoch and a decision variable important for foraging (whether to stay or to leave), a crucial function attributed to the anterior cingulate cortex(9-11). Furthermore, PV neurons could fire in millisecond synchrony, exerting fast and powerful inhibition on principal cell firing, whereas the inhibitory effect of SOM neurons on firing output was weak and more variable, consistent with the idea that they respectively control the outputs of, and inputs to, principal neurons(12-16). These results suggest a connection between the circuit-level function of different interneuron types in regulating the flow of information and the behavioural functions served by the cortical circuits. Moreover, these observations bolster the hope that functional response diversity during behaviour can in part be explained by cell-type diversity.","[Kvitsiani, D.; Ranade, S.; Hangya, B.; Taniguchi, H.; Huang, J.

However, microbial diversity is not limited to bacteria; microorganisms such as fungi also have major roles in microbial community stability, human health and disease(5). Genomic methodologies to identify fungal species and communities have been limited compared with those that are available for bacteria(6). Fungal evolution can be reconstructed with phylogenetic markers, including ribosomal RNA gene regions and other highly conserved genes(7). Here we sequenced and analysed fungal communities of 14 skin sites in 10 healthy adults. Eleven core-body and arm sites were dominated by fungi of the genus Malassezia, with only species-level classifications revealing fungal-community composition differences between sites. By contrast, three foot sites-plantar heel, toenail and toe web-showed high fungal diversity.

Once outside the vessel, individual neutrophils often show extremely coordinated chemotaxis and cluster formation reminiscent of the swarming behaviour of insects(3-11). The molecular players that direct this response at the single-cell and population levels within the complexity of an inflamed tissue are unknown. Using two-photon intravital microscopy in mouse models of sterile injury and infection, we show a critical role for intercellular signal relay among neutrophils mediated by the lipid leukotriene B4, which acutely amplifies local cell death signals to enhance the radius of highly directed interstitial neutrophil recruitment. Integrin receptors are dispensable for long-distance migration(12), but have a previously unappreciated role in maintaining dense cellular clusters when congregating neutrophils rearrange the collagenous fibre network of the dermis to form a collagen-free zone at the wound centre. In this newly formed environment, integrins, in concert with neutrophil-derived leukotriene B4 and other chemoattractants, promote local neutrophil interaction while forming a tight wound seal. This wound seal has borders that cease to grow in kinetic concert with late recruitment of monocytes and macrophages at the edge of the displaced collagen fibres. Together, these data provide an initial molecular map of the factors that contribute to neutrophil swarming in the extravascular space of a damaged tissue. They reveal how local events are propagated over large-range distances, and how auto-signalling produces coordinated, self-organized neutrophil-swarming behaviour that isolates the wound or infectious site from surrounding viable tissue.","[Laemmermann, Tim; Angermann, Bastian R.; Kastenmueller, Wolfgang; Germain, Ronald N.] NIAID, Lab Syst Biol, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Afonso, Philippe V.; Parent, Carole A.] NCI, Lab Cellular & Mol Biol, Ctr Canc Res, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Wang, Ji Ming] NCI, Lab Mol Immunoregulat, Canc & Inflammat Program, Ctr Canc Res,NIH, Frederick, MD 21702 USA; [Kastenmueller, Wolfgang] Univ Bonn, Inst Mol Med, D-53105 Bonn, Germany; [Kastenmueller, Wolfgang] Univ Bonn, Inst Expt Immunol, D-53105 Bonn, Germany","Lammermann, T (reprint author), NIAID, Lab Syst Biol, NIH, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",laemmermannt@niaid.nih.gov; rgermain@niaid.nih.gov,"Afonso, Philippe/D-2234-2014","Afonso, Philippe/0000-0002-4828-3797","Human Frontiers Science Program Long-Term Fellowship; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG); National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health; National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health","We thank L.

In humans and in macaque models, most of these cells contain viral DNA and are rapidly eliminated at the peak of viraemia(2-4), yet the mechanism by which HIV-1 induces helper T-cell death has not been defined. Here we show that virus-induced cell killing is triggered by viral integration. Infection by wild-type HIV-1, but not an integrase-deficient mutant, induced the death of activated primary CD4 lymphocytes. Similarly, raltegravir, a pharmacologic integrase inhibitor, abolished HIV-1-induced cell killing both in cell culture and in CD4(+) T cells from acutely infected subjects. The mechanism of killing during viral integration involved the activation of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), a central integrator of the DNA damage response, which caused phosphorylation of p53 and histone H2AX. Pharmacological inhibition of DNA-PK abolished cell death during HIV-1 infection in vitro, suggesting that processes which reduce DNA-PK activation in CD4 cells could facilitate the formation of latently infected cells that give rise to reservoirs in vivo. We propose that activation of DNA-PK during viral integration has a central role in CD4(+) T-cell depletion, raising the possibility that integrase inhibitors and interventions directed towards DNA-PK may improve T-cell survival and immune function in infected individuals.","[Cooper, Arik; Garcia, Mayra; Nabel, Gary J.] NIAID, Virol Lab, Vaccine Res Ctr, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Petrovas, Constantinos; Yamamoto, Takuya; Koup, Richard A.] NIAID, Immunol Lab, Vaccine Res Ctr, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Nabel, GJ (reprint author), NIAID, Virol Lab, Vaccine Res Ctr, NIH, Bldg 40,Room 4502,MSC 3005,40 Convent Dr, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",Gary.Nabel@sanofi.com,"Yamamoto, Takuya/L-2642-2013","Yamamoto, Takuya/0000-0003-3753-1211","Intramural Research Program of the Vaccine Research Center, NIAID, National Institutes of Health","We thank D.

Moreover, erroneous detection of endogenous DNA by the same sensing mechanisms has an important pathophysiological role in certain sterile inflammatory conditions(2,3). The endoplasmic-reticulum-resident protein STING is critically required for the initiation of type I interferon signalling upon detection of cytosolic DNA of both exogenous and endogenous origin(4-8). Next to its pivotal role in DNA sensing, STING also serves as a direct receptor for the detection of cyclic dinucleotides, which function as second messenger molecules in bacteria(9-13). DNA recognition, however, is triggered in an indirect fashion that depends on a recently characterized cytoplasmic nucleotidyl transferase, termed cGAMP synthase (cGAS), which upon interaction with DNA synthesizes a dinucleotide molecule that in turn binds to and activates STING(14,15). We here show in vivo and in vitro that the cGAS-catalysed reaction product is distinct from previously characterized cyclic dinucleotides. Using a combinatorial approach based on mass spectrometry, enzymatic digestion, NMR analysis and chemical synthesis we demonstrate that cGAS produces a cyclic GMP-AMP dinucleotide, which comprises a 2'-5' and a 3'-5' phosphodiester linkage. Gp(2'-5') Ap(3'-5')>. We found that the presence of this 2'-5' linkage was required to exert potent activation of human STING. Moreover, we show that cGAS first catalyses the synthesis of a linear 2'-5'-linked dinucleotide, which is then subject to cGAS-dependent cyclization in a second step through a 3'-5' phosphodiester linkage. This 13-membered ring structure defines a novel class of second messenger molecules, extending the family of 2'-5'-linked antiviral biomolecules.","[Ablasser, Andrea; Goldeck, Marion; Cavlar, Taner; Ludwig, Janos; Hornung, Veit] Univ Bonn, Univ Hosp, Inst Clin Chem & Clin Pharmacol, D-53127 Bonn, Germany; [Deimling, Tobias; Witte, Gregor; Hopfner, Karl-Peter] Univ Munich, Dept Biochem, D-81377 Munich, Germany; [Deimling, Tobias; Witte, Gregor; Hopfner, Karl-Peter] Univ Munich, Gene Ctr, D-81377 Munich, Germany; [Roehl, Ingo] Axolabs GmbH, D-95326 Kulmbach, Germany; [Hopfner, Karl-Peter] Ctr Integrated Prot Sci, D-81377 Munich, Germany","Ablasser, A (reprint author), Univ Bonn, Univ Hosp, Inst Clin Chem & Clin Pharmacol, D-53127 Bonn, Germany.",andrea.ablasser@uni-bonn.de; veit.hornung@uni-bonn.de,"; Hopfner, Karl-Peter/B-6864-2014; Ludwig, Janos/I-3544-2013","Witte, Gregor/0000-0003-0313-0962; Hornung, Veit/0000-0002-4150-194X; Hopfner, Karl-Peter/0000-0002-4528-8357; ","National Institutes of Health [U19AI083025]; European Research Council [322869, ERC 243046]; Center for Integrated Protein Science Munich (CIPSM); German Research Foundation [SFB670]","We thank M.

In Arabidopsis, DNA methylation is established by DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE 2 (DRM2) and targeted by 24-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) through a pathway termed RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM)(1). This pathway requires two plant-specific RNA polymerases: Pol-IV, which functions to initiate siRNA biogenesis, and Pol-V, which functions to generate scaffold transcripts that recruit downstream RdDM factors(1,2). To understand the mechanisms controlling Pol-IV targeting we investigated the function of SAWADEE HOMEODOMAIN HOMOLOG 1 (SHH1)(3,4), a Pol-IV-interacting protein(3). Here we show that SHH1 acts upstream in the RdDM pathway to enable siRNA production from a large subset of the most active RdDM targets, and that SHH1 is required for Pol-IV occupancy at these same loci. We also show that the SHH1 SAWADEE domain is a novel chromatin-binding module that adopts a unique tandem Tudor-like fold and functions as a dual lysine reader, probing for both unmethylated K4 and methylated K9 modifications on the histone 3 (H3) tail. Finally, we show that key residues within both lysine-binding pockets of SHH1 are required in vivo to maintain siRNA and DNA methylation levels as well as Pol-IV occupancy at RdDM targets, demonstrating a central role for methylated H3K9 binding in SHH1 function and providing the first insights into the mechanism of Pol-IV targeting. Given the parallels between methylation systems in plants and mammals(1,5), a further understanding of this early targeting step may aid our ability to control the expression of endogenous and newly introduced genes, which has broad implications for agriculture and gene therapy.","[Law, Julie A.; Hale, Christopher J.; Feng, Suhua; Jacobsen, Steven E.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Mol Cell & Dev Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Du, Jiamu; Patel, Dinshaw J.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Struct Biol Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Feng, Suhua; Jacobsen, Steven E.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Eli & Edythe Broad Ctr Regenerat Med & Stem Cell, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Feng, Suhua; Jacobsen, Steven E.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Krajewski, Krzysztof; Strahl, Brian D.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Palanca, Ana Marie S.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Jacobsen, SE (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Mol Cell & Dev Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",pateld@mskcc.org; jacobsen@ucla.edu,"Du, Jiamu/G-3308-2010; Du, Jiamu/I-1334-2013; Law, Julie/A-9566-2011","Du, Jiamu/0000-0002-1337-0786; Strahl, Brian D/0000-0002-4947-6259","Abby Rockefeller Mauze Trust; Maloris Foundation; STARR Foundation; NIH [GM60398, GM85394]; Damon Runyon postdoctoral fellowship","We are grateful to the staff of beamlines 24ID-C/E at the Argonne National Laboratory and X29A at the Brookhaven National Laboratory for support in diffraction data collection, to M.

Recent theoretical(1) and empirical(2) observations indicate that allostery is also manifest in intrinsically disordered proteins, which account for a substantial proportion of the proteome(3,4). Many intrinsically disordered proteins are promiscuous binders that interact with multiple partners and frequently function as molecular hubs in protein interaction networks. The adenovirus early region 1A (E1A) oncoprotein is a prime example of a molecular hub intrinsically disordered protein(5). E1A can induce marked epigenetic reprogramming of the cell within hours after infection, through interactions with a diverse set of partners that include key host regulators such as the general transcriptional coactivator CREB binding protein (CBP), its paralogue p300, and the retinoblastoma protein (pRb; also called RB1)(6,7). Little is known about the allosteric effects at play in E1A-CBP-pRb interactions, or more generally in hub intrinsically disordered protein interaction networks. Here we used single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to study coupled binding and folding processes in the ternary E1A system. The low concentrations used in these high-sensitivity experiments proved to be essential for these studies, which are challenging owing to a combination of E1A aggregation propensity and high-affinity binding interactions. Our data revealed that E1A-CBP-pRb interactions have either positive or negative cooperativity, depending on the available E1A interaction sites. This striking cooperativity switch enables fine-tuning of the thermodynamic accessibility of the ternary versus binary E1A complexes, and may permit a context-specific tuning of associated downstream signalling outputs. Such a modulation of allosteric interactions is probably a common mechanism in molecular hub intrinsically disordered protein function.","[Ferreon, Allan Chris M.; Ferreon, Josephine C.; Wright, Peter E.; Deniz, Ashok A.] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Integrat Struct & Computat Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Wright, Peter E.] Scripps Res Inst, Skaggs Inst Chem Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Deniz, AA (reprint author), Scripps Res Inst, Dept Integrat Struct & Computat Biol, 10550 North Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",wright@scripps.edu; deniz@scripps.edu,,"Wright, Peter/0000-0002-1368-0223; Ferreon, Josephine/0000-0002-3175-5700; Allan Chris, Ferreon/0000-0002-8538-1732","National Institutes of Health [GM066833, CA96865]; Skaggs Institute for Chemical Biology","We thank E.

Short-range atomic and long-range electrostatic interactions stabilize four beta gamma G-protein subunits at the interfaces between four K+ channel subunits, inducing a pre-open state of the channel. The pre-open state exhibits a conformation that is intermediate between the closed conformation and the open conformation of the constitutively active mutant. The resultant structural picture is compatible with 'membrane delimited' activation of GIRK channels by G proteins and the characteristic burst kinetics of channel gating.

Although Milky Way globular clusters are now known to harbour (at least) two generations of stars(1,2), they still provide relatively homogeneous samples of stars that are used to constrain stellar evolution theory(3-5). It is predicted by stellar models that the majority of cluster stars with masses around the current turn-off mass (that is, the mass of the stars that are currently leaving the main sequence phase) will evolve through the AGB phase(6,7). Here we report that all of the second-generation stars in the globular cluster NGC 6752-70 per cent of the cluster population-fail to reach the AGB phase. Through spectroscopic abundance measurements, we found that every AGB star in our sample has a low sodium abundance, indicating that they are exclusively first-generation stars. This implies that many clusters cannot reliably be used for star counts to test stellar evolution timescales if the AGB population is included.

B.",,,The spin Hall effect in a quantum gas,NATURE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,NEUTRAL ATOMS,"Electronic properties such as current flow are generally independent of the electron's spin angular momentum, an internal degree of freedom possessed by quantum particles. The spin Hall effect, first proposed 40 years ago(1), is an unusual class of phenomena in which flowing particles experience orthogonally directed, spin-dependent forces-analogous to the conventional Lorentz force that gives the Hall effect, but opposite in sign for two spin states. Spin Hall effects have been observed for electrons flowing in spin-orbit-coupled materials such as GaAs and InGaAs (refs 2, 3) and for laser light traversing dielectric junctions(4). Here we observe the spin Hall effect in a quantum-degenerate Bose gas, and use the resulting spin-dependent Lorentz forces to realize a cold-atom spin transistor. By engineering a spatially inhomogeneous spin-orbit coupling field for our quantum gas, we explicitly introduce and measure the requisite spin-dependent Lorentz forces, finding them to be in excellent agreement with our calculations. This 'atomtronic' transistor behaves as a type of velocity-insensitive adiabatic spin selector, with potential application in devices such as magnetic(5) or inertial(6) sensors. In addition, such techniques for creating and measuring the spin Hall effect are clear prerequisites for engineering topological insulators(7,8) and detecting their associated quantized spin Hall effects in quantum gases. As implemented, our system realizes a laser-actuated analogue to the archetypal semiconductor spintronic device, the Datta-Das spin transistor(9,10).","[Beeler, M. C.; Williams, R.

By extending these concepts to the temporal domain(14), investigators have recently described a cloak which hides events in time by creating a temporal gap in a probe beam that is subsequently closed up; any interaction which takes place during this hole in time is not detected(15). However, these results are limited to isolated events that fill a tiny portion of the temporal period, giving a fractional cloaking window of only about 10(-4) per cent at a repetition rate of 41 kilohertz (ref. 15)-which is much too low for applications such as optical communications. Here we demonstrate another technique for temporal cloaking, which operates at telecommunication data rates and, by exploiting temporal self-imaging through the Talbot effect, hides optical data from a receiver. We succeed in cloaking 46 per cent of the entire time axis and conceal pseudorandom digital data at a rate of 12.7 gigabits per second. This potential to cloak real-world messages introduces temporal cloaking into the sphere of practical application, with immediate ramifications in secure communications.","[Lukens, Joseph M.; Leaird, Daniel E.; Weiner, Andrew M.] Purdue Univ, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Weiner, AM (reprint author), Purdue Univ, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",amw@purdue.edu,,"Lukens, Joseph/0000-0001-9650-4462",National Science Foundation [ECCS-1102110]; Naval Postgraduate School under the National Security Science and Engineering Faculty Fellowship programme [N00244-09-1-0068]; Department of Defense through a National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship,"We thank V.

They are also ideal platforms for testing quantum transport theories that are required to describe charge and energy transfer in novel functional nano-metre-scale devices. Recent work has successfully probed electric and thermoelectric phenomena(2-8) in atomic-scale junctions. However, heat dissipation and transport in atomic-scale devices remain poorly characterized owing to experimental challenges. Here we use custom-fabricated scanning probes with integrated nanoscale thermocouples to investigate heat dissipation in the electrodes of single-molecule ('molecular') junctions. We find that if the junctions have transmission characteristics that are strongly energy dependent, this heat dissipation is asymmetric-that is, unequal between the electrodes-and also dependent on both the bias polarity and the identity of the majority charge carriers (electrons versus holes). In contrast, junctions consisting of only a few gold atoms ('atomic junctions') whose transmission characteristics show weak energy dependence do not exhibit appreciable asymmetry. Our results unambiguously relate the electronic transmission characteristics of atomic-scale junctions to their heat dissipation properties, establishing a framework for understanding heat dissipation in a range of mesoscopic systems where transport is elastic-that is, without exchange of energy in the contact region. We anticipate that the techniques established here will enable the study of Peltier effects at the atomic scale, a field that has been barely explored experimentally despite interesting theoretical predictions(9-11). Furthermore, the experimental advances described here are also expected to enable the study of heat transport in atomic and molecular junctions-an important and challenging scientific and technological goal that has remained elusive(12,13).","[Lee, Woochul; Kim, Kyeongtae; Jeong, Wonho; Reddy, Pramod] Univ Michigan, Dept Mech Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Angela Zotti, Linda; Carlos Cuevas, Juan] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Fis Teor Mat Condensada, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Angela Zotti, Linda; Carlos Cuevas, Juan] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Condensed Matter Phys Ctr IFIMAC, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Pauly, Fabian] Univ Konstanz, Dept Phys, D-78457 Constance, Germany; [Reddy, Pramod] Univ Michigan, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Reddy, P (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Dept Mech Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",juancarlos.cuevas@uam.es; pramodr@umich.edu,"Pauly, Fabian/I-8965-2012; Cuevas, Juan Carlos/B-7813-2012; Lee, Woochul/B-8753-2013; Zotti, Linda Angela/E-3242-2014","Pauly, Fabian/0000-0001-8017-2379; Cuevas, Juan Carlos/0000-0001-7421-0682; Lee, Woochul/0000-0002-0911-961X; Zotti, Linda Angela/0000-0002-5292-6759","US Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Division of Materials Sciences and Engineering [DE-SC0004871]; National Science Foundation [CBET 0844902]; Center for Solar and Thermal Energy conversion, an Energy Frontier Research Center; US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences [DE-SC0000957]; Spanish MICINN [FIS2010-21883]; Carl Zeiss Stiftung; DFG [SFB 767]; Baden-Wurttemberg Stiftung","P.R. acknowledges support from the US Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Division of Materials Sciences and Engineering under award no.

In particular, experimental deformation results(1-4) suggest that even only a few tens of parts per million of water by weight enhances the creep rates in olivine by orders of magnitude. However, those deformation studies have limitations, such as considering only a limited range of water concentrations and very high stresses, which might affect the results. Rock deformation can also be understood as an effect of silicon self-diffusion, because the creep rates of minerals at temperatures as high as those in the Earth's interior are limited by self-diffusion of the slowest species(5,6). Here we experimentally determine the silicon self-diffusion coefficient D-Si in forsterite at 8 GPa and 1,600 K to 1,800 K as a function of water content C-H2O from less than 1 to about 800 parts per million of water by weight, yielding the relationship, D-Si approximate to (C-H2O)(1/3). This exponent is strikingly lower than that obtained by deformation experiments (1.2; ref. 7). The high nominal creep rates in the deformation studies under wet conditions may be caused by excess grain boundary water. We conclude that the effect of water on upper-mantle rheology is very small. Hence, the smooth motion of the Earth's tectonic plates cannot be caused by mineral hydration in the asthenosphere. Also, water cannot cause the viscosity minimum zone in the upper mantle. And finally, the dominant mechanism responsible for hotspot immobility cannot be water content differences between their source and surrounding regions.","[Fei, Hongzhan; Katsura, Tomoo] Univ Bayreuth, Bayer Geoinst, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany; [Wiedenbeck, Michael] Helmholtz Ctr Potsdam, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Yamazaki, Daisuke] Okayama Univ, Inst Study Earths Interior, Tottori 6820193, Japan","Fei, HZ (reprint author), Univ Bayreuth, Bayer Geoinst, POB 101251, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany.",hongzhan.fei@uni-bayreuth.de,"Fei, Hongzhan/C-9661-2014; Fei, Hongzhan/E-7560-2017; Katsura, Tomoo/A-7483-2010","Fei, Hongzhan/0000-0003-3143-7363; Katsura, Tomoo/0000-0001-7857-5101",ENB (Elite Network Bavaria) programmes,"We thank S.

Weaning is critical to developmental and reproductive rates; early weaning can have detrimental health effects but enables shorter inter-birth intervals, which influences population growth(3). Uncovering early-life dietary history in fossils is hampered by the absence of prospectively validated biomarkers that are not modified during fossilization(4). Here we show that large dietary shifts in early life manifest as compositional variations in dental tissues. Teeth from human children and captive macaques, with prospectively recorded diet histories, demonstrate that barium (Ba) distributions accurately reflect dietary transitions from the introduction of mother's milk through the weaning process. We also document dietary transitions in a Middle Palaeolithic juvenile Neanderthal, which shows a pattern of exclusive breastfeeding for seven months, followed by seven months of supplementation. After this point, Ba levels in enamel returned to baseline prenatal levels, indicating an abrupt cessation of breastfeeding at 1.2 years of age. Integration of Ba spatial distributions and histological mapping of tooth formation enables novel studies of the evolution of human life history, dietary ontogeny in wild primates, and human health investigations through accurate reconstructions of breastfeeding history.","[Austin, Christine; Arora, Manish] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Prevent Med, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Austin, Christine; Arora, Manish] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Austin, Christine; Arora, Manish] Westmead Hosp, Westmead Millennium Inst, Inst Dent Res, Sydney, NSW 2145, Australia; [Austin, Christine; Arora, Manish] Univ Sydney, Fac Dent, Sydney, NSW 2145, Australia; [Smith, Tanya M.; Hinde, Katie] Harvard Univ, Dept Human Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Bradman, Asa; Eskenazi, Brenda] Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Publ Hlth, Ctr Environm Res & Childrens Hlth, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Hinde, Katie] Calif Natl Primate Res Ctr, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Joannes-Boyau, Renaud] So Cross Univ, Lismore, NSW 2480, Australia; [Bishop, David; Hare, Dominic J.; Doble, Philip] Univ Technol Sydney, Elemental Bioimaging Facil, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Hare, Dominic J.] Univ Melbourne, Florey Inst Neurosci & Mental Hlth, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia","Arora, M (reprint author), Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Prevent Med, New York, NY 10029 USA.",marora@hsph.harvard.edu,"; Hare, Dominic/H-2481-2011; Joannes-Boyau, Renaud/D-6058-2012; Smith, Tanya/T-2683-2017","Hinde, Katie/0000-0002-0528-866X; Doble, Philip/0000-0002-8472-1301; Bishop, David/0000-0002-6533-4410; Hare, Dominic/0000-0002-5922-7643; Joannes-Boyau, Renaud/0000-0002-0452-486X; ","US Environmental Protection Agency [RD 83171001, RD 82670901]; US National Institutes of Environmental Health Sciences [PO1 ES009605]; NSF [BCS-0921978]; Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology; Australian Research Council [DP120101752, LP100200254]; SCU postdoctoral Fellowship grant; National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences [4R00ES019597-03]; NHMRC [APP1028372]; Agilent Technologies; Kennelec Scientific","L.

Many cases occur sporadically and impair reproductive fitness, suggesting a role for de novo mutations. Here we compare the incidence of de novo mutations in 362 severe CHD cases and 264 controls by analysing exome sequencing of parent-offspring trios. CHD cases show a significant excess of protein-altering de novo mutations in genes expressed in the developing heart, with an odds ratio of 7.5 for damaging (premature termination, frameshift, splice site) mutations. Similar odds ratios are seen across the main classes of severe CHD. We find a marked excess of de novo mutations in genes involved in the production, removal or reading of histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation, or ubiquitination of H2BK120, which is required for H3K4 methylation(2-4). There are also two de novo mutations in SMAD2, which regulates H3K27 methylation in the embryonic left-right organizer(5). The combination of both activating (H3K4 methylation) and inactivating (H3K27 methylation) chromatin marks characterizes 'poised' promoters and enhancers, which regulate expression of key developmental genes(6). These findings implicate de novo point mutations in several hundreds of genes that collectively contribute to approximately 10% of severe CHD.","[Zaidi, Samir; Choi, Murim; Overton, John D.; Fakhro, Khalid A.; Lopez, Alexander; Mane, Shrikant M.; Sanders, Stephan J.; State, Mathew W.; Tikhonova, Irina R.; Zhao, Hongyu; Brueckner, Martina; Lifton, Richard P.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, New Haven, CT 06504 USA; [Zaidi, Samir; Choi, Murim; Fakhro, Khalid A.; Lifton, Richard P.] Yale Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Wakimoto, Hiroko; Jiang, Jianming; Brown, Kerry K.; DePalma, Steve; Parfenov, Michael; Seidman, Jonathan G.; Seidman, Christine E.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Ma, Lijiang; Lee, Teresa; Warburton, Dorothy; Williams, Ismee A.; Chung, Wendy K.] Columbia Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Pediat, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Jiang, Jianming; Seidman, Christine E.] Harvard Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Overton, John D.; Lopez, Alexander; Mane, Shrikant M.; Tikhonova, Irina R.; Lifton, Richard P.] Yale Ctr Mendelian Genom, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Overton, John D.; Bjornson, Robert D.; Carriero, Nicholas J.; Lopez, Alexander; Mane, Shrikant M.; Tikhonova, Irina R.; Lifton, Richard P.] Yale Univ, Yale Ctr Genome Anal, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Romano-Adesman, Angela] Steven & Alexandra Cohen Childrens Med Ctr New Yo, New Hyde Pk, NY 11040 USA; [Bjornson, Robert D.; Carriero, Nicholas J.] Yale Univ, Dept Comp Sci, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Breitbart, Roger E.; Newburger, Jane W.; Roberts, Amy E.] Childrens Hosp, Dept Cardiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Cheung, Yee Him] Columbia Univ, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Deanfield, John; Kaski, Juan] Great Ormond St Hosp Sick Children, Univ Coll London, Dept Cardiol, London WC1N 3JH, England; [Glessner, Joseph; Hakonarson, Hakon] Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Ctr Appl Genom, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Hakonarson, Hakon; White, Peter S.; Goldmuntz, Elizabeth] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Italia, Michael J.; Leipzig, Jeremy; Wang, Wei; White, Peter S.] Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Ctr Biomed Informat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Kaltman, Jonathan R.] NHLBI, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Kim, Richard] Univ So Calif, Keck Sch Med, Sect Cardiothorac Surg, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Kline, Jennie K.] Columbia Univ, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Mitchell, Laura E.] Univ Texas Sch Publ Hlth, Div Epidemiol Human Genet & Environm Sci, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Pe'er, Itsik] Columbia Univ, Dept Comp Sci, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Porter, George] Univ Rochester, Sch Med & Dent, Med Ctr, Dept Pediat, Rochester, NY 14611 USA; [Sachidanandam, Ravi; Subramanian, Sailakshmi; Gelb, Bruce D.] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Sanders, Stephan J.; State, Mathew W.] Yale Univ, Dept Psychiat, Ctr Child Study, Program Neurogenet, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Seiden, Howard S.; Gelb, Bruce D.] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Pediat, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Wang, Wei] New Jersey Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Newark, NJ 07102 USA; [Warburton, Dorothy] Columbia Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Zhao, Hongyu] Yale Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Brueckner, Martina] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Chung, Wendy K.] Columbia Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Med, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Gelb, Bruce D.] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Mindich Child Hlth & Dev Inst, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Goldmuntz, Elizabeth] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Div Cardiol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Seidman, Christine E.] Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Cardiovasc, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Lifton, Richard P.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, New Haven, CT 06510 USA","Brueckner, M (reprint author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, 333 Cedar St, New Haven, CT 06504 USA.",martina.brueckner@yale.edu; wkc15@cumc.columbia.edu; bruce.gelb@mssm.edu; goldmuntz@email.chop.edu; csediman@genetics.med.harvard.edu; richard.lifton@yale.edu,"Porter, George/E-7315-2013; jiang, jianming/B-3421-2012","Porter, George/0000-0003-0726-9988; jiang, jianming/0000-0003-3251-2716; Subramanian, Sai Lakshmi/0000-0003-1384-0722; Sanders, Stephan/0000-0001-9112-5148; Leipzig, Jeremy/0000-0001-7224-9620; sachidanandam, ravi/0000-0001-9844-4459; Kaski, Juan Pablo/0000-0002-0014-9927","National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium [U01-HL098188, U01-HL098147, U01-HL098153, U01-HL098163, U01-HL098123, U01-HL098162]; Simons Foundation for Autism Research; NIH Centers for Mendelian Genomics [5U54HG006504]","The authors are grateful to the patients and families who participated in this research.

Mice homozygous for the Tyr208Asn amino acid substitution in the carboxy terminus of SHP-1 (referred to as Ptpn6(spin) mice) spontaneously develop a severe inflammatory syndrome that resembles neutrophilic dermatosis in humans and is characterized by persistent footpad swelling and suppurative inflammation(2,3). Here we report that receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1)-regulated interleukin (IL)-1 alpha production by haematopoietic cells critically mediates chronic inflammatory disease in Ptpn6(spin) mice, whereas inflammasome signalling and IL-1 beta-mediated events are dispensable. IL-1 alpha was also crucial for exacerbated inflammatory responses and unremitting tissue damage upon footpad microabrasion of Ptpn6(spin) mice. Notably, pharmacological and genetic blockade of the kinase RIP1 protected against wound-induced inflammation and tissue damage in Ptpn6(spin) mice, whereas RIP3 deletion failed to do so. Moreover, RIP1-mediated inflammatory cytokine production was attenuated by NF-kappa B and ERK inhibition. Together, our results indicate that wound-induced tissue damage and chronic inflammation in Ptpn6(spin) mice are critically dependent on RIP1-mediated IL-1 alpha production, whereas inflammasome signalling and RIP3-mediated necroptosis are dispensable. Thus, we have unravelled a novel inflammatory circuit in which RIP1-mediated IL-1 alpha secretion in response to deregulated SHP-1 activity triggers an inflammatory destructive disease that proceeds independently of inflammasomes and programmed necrosis.","[Lukens, John R.; Johnson, Gordon R.; Kanneganti, Thirumala-Devi] St Jude Childrens Res Hosp, Dept Immunol, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Vogel, Peter] St Jude Childrens Res Hosp, Anim Resources Ctr, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Vogel, Peter] St Jude Childrens Res Hosp, Vet Pathol Core, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Kelliher, Michelle A.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Canc Biol, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Iwakura, Yoichiro] Univ Tokyo, Inst Med Sci, Ctr Med Expt, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; [Lamkanfi, Mohamed] Univ Ghent VIB, Dept Med Prot Res, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Lamkanfi, Mohamed] Univ Ghent, Dept Biochem, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium","Kanneganti, TD (reprint author), St Jude Childrens Res Hosp, Dept Immunol, 332 N Lauderdale St, Memphis, TN 38105 USA.",Thirumala-Devi.Kanneganti@StJude.org,"Iwakura, Yoichiro/E-5457-2011","Iwakura, Yoichiro/0000-0002-9934-5775; Kanneganti, Thirumala-Devi/0000-0002-6395-6443","European Union [256432]; ERC [281600]; Fund for Scientific Research-Flanders [G030212N, 1.2.201.10.N.00, 1.5.122.11.N.00]; National Institutes of Health [AR056296, CA163507, AI101935]; American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities (ALSAC)","We thank B.

Serial blood passage of Plasmodium through rodents(1-3), primates(4) or humans(5) increases parasite virulence, suggesting that vector transmission regulates Plasmodium virulence within the mammalian host. In agreement, disease severity can be modified by vector transmission(6-8), which is assumed to 'reset' Plasmodium to its original character(3). However, direct evidence that vector transmission regulates Plasmodium virulence is lacking. Here we use mosquito transmission of serially blood passaged (SBP) Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi(9) to interrogate regulation of parasite virulence. Analysis of SBP P.c. chabaudi before and after mosquito transmission demonstrates that vector transmission intrinsically modifies the asexual blood-stage parasite, which in turn modifies the elicited mammalian immune response, which in turn attenuates parasite growth and associated pathology. Attenuated parasite virulence associates with modified expression of the pir multi-gene family. Vector transmission of Plasmodium therefore regulates gene expression of probable variant antigens in the erythrocytic cycle, modifies the elicited mammalian immune response, and thus regulates parasite virulence. These results place the mosquito at the centre of our efforts to dissect mechanisms of protective immunity to malaria for the development of an effective vaccine.","[Spence, Philip J.; Jarra, William; Levy, Prisca; Brugat, Thibaut; Langhorne, Jean] Natl Inst Med Res, MRC, Div Parasitol, London NW7 1AA, England; [Reid, Adam J.; Chappell, Lia; Sanders, Mandy; Berriman, Matthew] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Cambridge CB10 1SA, England","Langhorne, J (reprint author), Natl Inst Med Res, MRC, Div Parasitol, Mill Hill, London NW7 1AA, England.",jlangho@nimr.mrc.ac.uk,"Berriman, Matthew/A-7618-2011","Berriman, Matthew/0000-0002-9581-0377; Langhorne, Jean/0000-0002-2257-9733; Chappell, Lia/0000-0002-2317-3524; Reid, Adam/0000-0002-5926-7768","Medical Research Council [U117584248]; Wellcome Trust [089553, 098051]; Leverhulme Trust","This work was supported by the Medical Research Council (U117584248) and the Wellcome Trust (089553 and 098051).

To discover rare variants and test them for association with a phenotype, most studies re-sequence a small initial sample size and then genotype the discovered variants in a larger sample set(3-5). This approach fails to analyse a large fraction of the rare variants present in the entire sample set. Here we perform simultaneous amplicon-sequencing-based variant discovery and genotyping for coding exons of 25 GWAS risk genes in 41,911 UK residents of white European origin, comprising 24,892 subjects with six autoimmune disease phenotypes and 17,019 controls, and show that rare coding-region variants at known loci have a negligible role in common autoimmune disease susceptibility. These results do not support the rare-variant synthetic genome-wide-association hypothesis(6) (in which unobserved rare causal variants lead to association detected at common tag variants). Many known autoimmune disease risk loci contain multiple, independently associated, common and low-frequency variants, and so genes at these loci are a priori stronger candidates for harbouring rare coding-region variants than other genes. Our data indicate that the missing heritability for common autoimmune diseases may not be attributable to the rare coding-region variant portion of the allelic spectrum, but perhaps, as others have proposed, may be a result of many common-variant loci of weak effect(7-10).","[Hunt, Karen A.; Mistry, Vanisha; Bockett, Nicholas A.; van Heel, David A.] Queen Mary Univ London, Barts & London Sch Med & Dent, Blizard Inst, London E1 2AT, England; [Ahmad, Tariq] Peninsula Coll Med & Dent, Exeter EX2 5DW, Devon, England; [Ban, Maria; Compston, Alastair; Sawcer, Steven] Univ Cambridge, Addenbrookes Hosp, Dept Clin Neurosci, Cambridge CB2 0QQ, England; [Barker, Jonathan N.; Capon, Francesca; Mathew, Christopher G.; Mirza, Muddassar; Papouli, Efterpi; Simpson, Michael A.] Kings Coll London, Sch Med, Div Genet & Mol Med, Guys Hosp, London SE1 9RT, England; [Barrett, Jeffrey C.; Blackburn, Hannah] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Cambridge CB10 1SA, England; [Brand, Oliver; Gough, Stephen C.

Existing studies of cellular heterogeneity, however, have typically measured only a few pre-selected RNAs1,2 or proteins(5,6) simultaneously, because genomic profiling methods(3) could not be applied to single cells until very recently(7-10). Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate heterogeneity in the response of mouse bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) to lipopolysaccharide. We find extensive, and previously unobserved, bimodal variation in messenger RNA abundance and splicing patterns, which we validate by RNA-fluorescence in situ hybridization for select transcripts. In particular, hundreds of key immune genes are bimodally expressed across cells, surprisingly even for genes that are very highly expressed at the population average. Moreover, splicing patterns demonstrate previously unobserved levels of heterogeneity between cells. Some of the observed bimodality can be attributed to closely related, yet distinct, known maturity states of BMDCs; other portions reflect differences in the usage of key regulatory circuits. For example, we identify a module of 137 highly variable, yet co-regulated, antiviral response genes. Using cells from knockout mice, we show that variability in this module may be propagated through an interferon feedback circuit, involving the transcriptional regulators Stat2 and Irf7. Our study demonstrates the power and promise of single-cell genomics in uncovering functional diversity between cells and in deciphering cell states and circuits.","[Shalek, Alex K.; Gertner, Rona S.; Gaublomme, Jellert T.; Park, Hongkun] Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Shalek, Alex K.; Gertner, Rona S.; Gaublomme, Jellert T.; Park, Hongkun] Harvard Univ, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Satija, Rahul; Adiconis, Xian; Raychowdhury, Raktima; Schwartz, Schraga; Yosef, Nir; Malboeuf, Christine; Lu, Diana; Trombetta, John J.; Gennert, Dave; Gnirke, Andreas; Goren, Alon; Hacohen, Nir; Levin, Joshua Z.; Park, Hongkun; Regev, Aviv] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge Ctr 7, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Goren, Alon] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Pathol, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Goren, Alon] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Syst Biol, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Goren, Alon] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Canc Res, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Hacohen, Nir] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Immunol & Inflammatory Dis, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Hacohen, Nir] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Med, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Regev, Aviv] MIT, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02140 USA","Park, H (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, 12 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",Hongkun_Park@harvard.edu; aregev@broad.mit.edu,,"Schwartz, Schraga/0000-0002-3671-9709; Goren, Alon/0000-0001-5669-9357; Shalek, Alex K./0000-0001-5670-8778","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [1F32HD075541-01, U54 AI057159, DP2 OD002230, 5DP1OD003893-03, DP1OD003958-01]; Charles H.

Alternative splicing represents a widely acting mode of gene regulation(4-8), yet its role in regulating ES-cell pluripotency and differentiation is poorly understood. Here we identify the muscleblind-like RNA binding proteins, MBNL1 and MBNL2, as conserved and direct negative regulators of a large program of cassette exon alternative splicing events that are differentially regulated between ES cells and other cell types. Knockdown of MBNL proteins in differentiated cells causes switching to an ES-cell-like alternative splicing pattern for approximately half of these events, whereas overexpression of MBNL proteins in ES cells promotes differentiated-cell-like alternative splicing patterns. Among the MBNL-regulated events is an ES-cell-specific alternative splicing switch in the forkhead family transcription factor FOXP1 that controls pluripotency(9). Consistent with a central and negative regulatory role for MBNL proteins in pluripotency, their knockdown significantly enhances the expression of key pluripotency genes and the formation of induced pluripotent stem cells during somatic cell reprogramming.","[Han, Hong; Irimia, Manuel; Gabut, Mathieu; Nachman, Emil N.; O'Hanlon, Dave; Slobodeniuc, Valentina; Barbosa-Morais, Nuno L.; Moffat, Jason; Frey, Brendan J.; Blencowe, Benjamin J.] Univ Toronto, Banting & Best Dept Med Res, Toronto, ON M5S 3E1, Canada; [Han, Hong; Irimia, Manuel; Gabut, Mathieu; Nachman, Emil N.; O'Hanlon, Dave; Slobodeniuc, Valentina; Barbosa-Morais, Nuno L.; Moffat, Jason; Frey, Brendan J.; Blencowe, Benjamin J.] Univ Toronto, Donnelly Ctr, Toronto, ON M5S 3E1, Canada; [Han, Hong; Golipour, Azadeh; Nachman, Emil N.; Moffat, Jason; Ellis, James; Wrana, Jeffrey L.; Blencowe, Benjamin J.] Univ Toronto, Dept Mol Genet, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [Ross, P.

Alterations in chromatin structure are implicated in the initiation and propagation of the DNA damage response(2). Here we further investigate the role of chromatin structure in the DNA damage response by monitoring ionizing-radiation-induced signalling and response events with a high-content multiplex RNA-mediated interference screen of chromatin-modifying and -interacting genes. We discover that an isoform of Brd4, a bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family member, functions as an endogenous inhibitor of DNA damage response signalling by recruiting the condensin II chromatin remodelling complex to acetylated histones through bromodomain interactions. Loss of this isoform results in relaxed chromatin structure, rapid cell-cycle checkpoint recovery and enhanced survival after irradiation, whereas functional gain of this isoform compacted chromatin, attenuated DNA damage response signalling and enhanced radiation-induced lethality. These data implicate Brd4, previously known for its role in transcriptional control, as an insulator of chromatin that can modulate the signalling response to DNA damage.","[Floyd, Scott R.; Pacold, Michael E.; Huang, Qiuying; Clarke, Scott M.; Lam, Fred C.; Cannell, Ian G.; Bryson, Bryan D.; Rameseder, Jonathan; Lee, Michael J.; Blake, Emily J.; Fydrych, Anna; Ho, Richard; Greenberger, Benjamin A.; Chen, Grace C.; Maffa, Amanda; Del Rosario, Amanda M.; White, Forest M.; Yaffe, Michael B.] MIT, Koch Inst Integrat Canc Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Floyd, Scott R.] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Dept Radiat Oncol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Pacold, Michael E.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Radiat Oncol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Pacold, Michael E.; Sabatini, David M.] Whitehead Inst, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Root, David E.; Carpenter, Anne E.; Hahn, William C.; Sabatini, David M.; Bradner, James E.; Yaffe, Michael B.] Broad Inst Harvard & MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Hahn, William C.; Chen, Clark C.; Bradner, James E.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Chen, Clark C.; Yaffe, Michael B.] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Dept Surg, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [White, Forest M.; Yaffe, Michael B.] MIT, Dept Biol Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Yaffe, Michael B.] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Yaffe, MB (reprint author), MIT, Koch Inst Integrat Canc Res, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",myaffe@mit.edu,,"Lee, Michael/0000-0003-3378-6196; White, Forest/0000-0002-1545-1651; /0000-0002-1446-7256","Koch Institute; Center for Environmental Health Sciences National Institutes of Health [P30-CA14051, ES-002109]; SPARC; Holman Pathway Research Resident Seed Grant; American Society for Radiation Oncology Junior Faculty Career Research Training Award; Burroughs Wellcome Career Award for Medical Scientists;  [R01-ES15339];  [1-U54-CA112967-04];  [R21-NS063917]","We thank H.

Sister chromatids may be distinguished and segregated nonrandomly in asymmetrically dividing stem cells(2), although the underlying mechanism and the purpose it may serve remain elusive. Here we develop the CO-FISH(chromosome orientation fluorescence in situ hybridization) technique(3) with single-chromosome resolution and show that sister chromatids of X and Y chromosomes, but not autosomes, are segregated nonrandomly during asymmetric divisions of Drosophila male germline stem cells. This provides the first direct evidence, to our knowledge, that two sister chromatids containing identical genetic information can be distinguished and segregated nonrandomly during asymmetric stem-cell divisions. We further show that the centrosome, SUN-KASH nuclear envelope proteins and Dnmt2 (also known as Mt2) are required for nonrandom sister chromatid segregation. Our data indicate that the information on X and Y chromosomes that enables nonrandom segregation is primed during gametogenesis in the parents. Moreover, we show that sister chromatid segregation is randomized in germline stem cell overproliferation and dedifferentiated germline stem cells. We propose that nonrandom sister chromatid segregation may serve to transmit distinct information carried on two sister chromatids to the daughters of asymmetrically dividing stem cells.","[Yadlapalli, Swathi; Yamashita, Yukiko M.] Univ Michigan, Inst Life Sci, Ctr Stem Cell Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Yadlapalli, Swathi; Yamashita, Yukiko M.] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Yamashita, Yukiko M.] Univ Michigan, Cellular & Mol Biol Program, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Yadlapalli, S (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Inst Life Sci, Ctr Stem Cell Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",swathi@umich.edu; yukikomy@umich.edu,,"Yamashita, Yukiko/0000-0001-5541-0216",University of Michigan (Life Sciences Institute and Office of the Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs); AHA [12PRE9630000]; NIH [1F31HD071727-01]; MacArthur Foundation,"We thank F.

Coupled with detailed morphological examination using propagation phase contrast X-ray synchrotron microtomography, our phylogenetic analysis based on total available evidence indicates that this fossil is the most basal known member of the tarsiiform clade. In addition to providing further support for an early dichotomy between the strepsirrhine and haplorhine clades, this new primate further constrains the age of divergence between tarsiiforms and anthropoids.

During movements of the head this alignment is maintained by numerous reflexes. Although rodents share with other mammals the key components of eye movement control, the coordination of eye movements in freely moving rodents is unknown. Here we show that movements of the two eyes in freely moving rats differ fundamentally from the precisely controlled eye movements used by other mammals to maintain continuous binocular fusion. The observed eye movements serve to keep the visual fields of the two eyes continuously overlapping above the animal during free movement, but not continuously aligned. Overhead visual stimuli presented to rats freely exploring an open arena evoke an immediate shelter-seeking behaviour, but are ineffective when presented beside the arena. We suggest that continuously overlapping visual fields overhead would be of evolutionary benefit for predator detection by minimizing blind spots.","[Wallace, Damian J.; Greenberg, David S.; Sawinski, Juergen; Rulla, Stefanie; Notaro, Giuseppe; Kerr, Jason N.

However, the regulatory mechanisms that couple chromatin sensing to DNA-damage signalling in mammalian cells are not well understood. Here we show that tyrosine phosphorylation of the protein acetyltransferase KAT5 (also known as TIP60) increases after DNA damage in a manner that promotes KAT5 binding to the histone mark H3K9me3. This triggers KAT5-mediated acetylation of the ATM kinase, promoting DNA-damage-checkpoint activation and cell survival. We also establish that chromatin alterations can themselves enhance KAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation and ATM-dependent signalling, and identify the proto-oncogene c-Abl as a mediator of this modification. These findings define KAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation as a key event in the sensing of genomic and chromatin perturbations, and highlight a key role for c-Abl in such processes.","[Kaidi, Abderrahmane; Jackson, Stephen P.] Univ Cambridge, Gurdon Inst, Cambridge CB2 1QN, England; [Kaidi, Abderrahmane; Jackson, Stephen P.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Biochem, Cambridge CB2 1QN, England; [Jackson, Stephen P.] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Cambridge CB10 1SA, England","Jackson, SP (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Gurdon Inst, Tennis Court Rd, Cambridge CB2 1QN, England.",s.jackson@gurdon.cam.ac.uk,"Dry, Kate/I-2328-2014","Kaidi, Abderrahmane/0000-0001-9411-8912; Jackson, Stephen Philip/0000-0001-9317-7937","Cancer Research UK program [C6/A11224]; European Research Council; European Community [HEALTH-F2-2010-259893 (DDR)]; CRUK [C6946/A14492]; Wellcome Trust [WT092096]; University of Cambridge, UK; Herchel Smith Fellowship from the University of Cambridge","We thank all members of the Jackson laboratory for help and support, and A.

Such a critical point requires a line of classical phase transitions terminating at zero temperature near optimal doping inside the superconducting 'dome'. The underdoped region of the temperature-doping phase diagram from which superconductivity emerges is referred to as the 'pseudogap'(7-13) because evidence exists for partial gapping of the conduction electrons, but so far there is no compelling thermodynamic evidence as to whether the pseudogap is a distinct phase or a continuous evolution of physical properties on cooling. Here we report that the pseudogap in YBa2Cu3O6+delta is a distinct phase, bounded by a line of phase transitions. The doping dependence of this line is such that it terminates at zero temperature inside the superconducting dome. From this we conclude that quantum criticality drives the strange metallic behaviour and therefore superconductivity in the copper oxide superconductors.","[Shekhter, Arkady; Ramshaw, B.

It occurs below a critical temperature(1,2) and leads to peculiar behaviour such as frictionless flow, the formation of quantized vortices and quenching of the moment of inertia. Ultracold atomic gases offer control of interactions and external confinement, providing unique opportunities to explore superfluid phenomena. Many such (finite-temperature) phenomena can be explained in terms of a two-fluid mixture(3,4) comprising a normal component, which behaves like an ordinary fluid, and a superfluid component with zero viscosity and zero entropy. The two-component nature of a superfluid is manifest in 'second sound', an entropy wave in which the superfluid and the non-superfluid components oscillate with opposite phases (as opposed to ordinary 'first sound', where they oscillate in phase). Here we report the observation of second sound in an ultracold Fermi gas with resonant interactions. The speed of second sound depends explicitly on the value of the superfluid fraction(5), a quantity that is sensitive to the spectrum of elementary excitations(6). Our measurements allow us to extract the temperature dependence of the superfluid fraction, a previously inaccessible quantity that will provide a benchmark for theories of strongly interacting quantum gases.","[Sidorenkov, Leonid A.; Tey, Meng Khoon; Grimm, Rudolf] Austrian Acad Sci, Inst Quantenopt & Quanteninformat, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Sidorenkov, Leonid A.; Tey, Meng Khoon; Grimm, Rudolf] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Expt Phys, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Sidorenkov, Leonid A.; Tey, Meng Khoon; Grimm, Rudolf] Univ Innsbruck, Zentrum Quantenphys, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Hou, Yan-Hua; Pitaevskii, Lev; Stringari, Sandro] Univ Trent, Dipartimento Fis, I-38123 Povo, Italy; [Hou, Yan-Hua; Pitaevskii, Lev; Stringari, Sandro] INO CNR BEC Ctr, I-38123 Povo, Italy; [Pitaevskii, Lev] Russian Acad Sci, Kapitza Inst Phys Problems, Moscow 119334, Russia","Tey, MK (reprint author), Austrian Acad Sci, Inst Quantenopt & Quanteninformat, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",mengkhoon.tey@ultracold.at,"Grimm, Rudolf/D-2864-2009; Tey, Meng Khoon/D-4651-2016","Grimm, Rudolf/0000-0003-1085-5558; ",Austrian Science Fund (FWF) within SFB FoQuS [F4004-N16]; European Research Council; Provincia Autonoma di Trento,"We thank E.

Molecular vibrations provide a valuable 'finger-print' for such identification. Vibrational spectroscopy based on tip-enhanced Raman scattering allows us to access the spectral signals of molecular species very efficiently via the strong localized plasmonic fields produced at the tip apex(1-11). However, the best spatial resolution of the tip-enhanced Raman scattering imaging is still limited to 3-15 nanometres(5,12-16), which is not adequate for resolving a single molecule chemically. Here we demonstrate Raman spectral imaging with spatial resolution below one nanometre, resolving the inner structure and surface configuration of a single molecule. This is achieved by spectrally matching the resonance of the nanocavity plasmon to the molecular vibronic transitions, particularly the downward transition responsible for the emission of Raman photons. This matching is made possible by the extremely precise tuning capability provided by scanning tunnelling microscopy. Experimental evidence suggests that the highly confined and broadband nature of the nanocavity plasmon field in the tunnelling gap is essential for ultrahigh-resolution imaging through the generation of an efficient double-resonance enhancement for both Raman excitation and Raman emission. Our technique not only allows for chemical imaging at the single-molecule level, but also offers a new way to study the optical processes and photochemistry of a single molecule.","[Zhang, R.; Zhang, Y.; Dong, Z.

The isotopic signatures of noble gases in the silicate Earth (mantle, crust) and in the atmosphere afford exceptional insight into the evolution through time of these geochemical reservoirs(9). However, no data for the compositions of these reservoirs exists for the distant past, and temporal exchange rates between Earth's interior and its surface are severely under-constrained owing to a lack of samples preserving the original signature of the atmosphere at the time of their formation. Here, we report the analysis of argon in Archaean (3.5-billion-year-old) hydrothermal quartz. Noble gases are hosted in primary fluid inclusions containing a mixture of Archaean freshwater and hydrothermal fluid. Our analysis reveals Archaean atmospheric argon with a Ar-40/Ar-36 value of 143 +/- 24, lower than the present-day value of 298.6 (for which Ar-40 has been produced by the radioactive decay of the potassium isotope K-40, with a half-life of 1.25 billion years; Ar-36 is primordial in origin). This ratio is consistent with an early development of the felsic crust, which might have had an important role in climate variability during the first half of Earth's history.","[Pujol, Magali; Marty, Bernard] Univ Lorraine, CRPG CNRS, F-54501 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France; [Burgess, Ray; Turner, Grenville] Univ Manchester, Sch Earth Atmospher & Environm Sci, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Philippot, Pascal] Univ Paris Diderot, CNRS, Inst Phys Globe Paris, Sorbonne Paris Cite, F-75238 Paris 5, France","Marty, B (reprint author), Univ Lorraine, CRPG CNRS, 15 Rue Notre Dame Pauvres, F-54501 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France.",bmarty@crpg.cnrs-nancy.fr,"Burgess, Ray/A-5767-2009","Burgess, Ray/0000-0001-7674-8718",CNRS; Region Lorraine; ANR (Agence Nationale pour la Recherche); European Research Council under the European Community [267255]; Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris (IPGP); Geological Survey of Western Australia (GSWA),"We thank D.

Long-term studies have shown that the traits of individual mammals and birds are associated with their reproductive success(2-6), but little is known about the evolutionary ecology of collective behaviour in natural populations. An ant colony operates without central control, regulating its activity through a network of local interactions(7). This work shows that variation among harvester ant (Pogonomyrmex barbatus) colonies in collective response to changing conditions(8) is related to variation in colony lifetime reproductive success in the production of offspring colonies. Desiccation costs are high for harvester ants foraging in the desert(9,10). More successful colonies tend to forage less when conditions are dry, and show relatively stable foraging activity when conditions are more humid. Restraint from foraging does not compromise a colony's long-term survival; colonies that fail to forage at all on many days survive as long, over the colony's 20-30-year lifespan, as those that forage more regularly. Sensitivity to conditions in which to reduce foraging activity may be transmissible from parent to offspring colony. These results indicate that natural selection is shaping the collective behaviour that regulates foraging activity, and that the selection pressure, related to climate, may grow stronger if the current drought in their habitat persists.","Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Gordon, DM (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",dmgordon@stanford.edu,,,Stanford Office of the Dean of Research; Stanford Emergence of Cooperation Project; National Science Foundation [IOS-0718631],"Thanks to the many people who helped with field work: in 1986 and 1987, K.

Despite its tiny size, the U. gibba genome accommodates a typical number of genes for a plant, with the main difference from other plant genomes arising from a drastic reduction in non-genic DNA. Unexpectedly, we identified at least three rounds of WGD in U. gibba since common ancestry with tomato (Solanum) and grape (Vitis).

Statistical models that combine known risk factors for T2D can partly identify individuals at high risk of developing the disease. However, these studies have so far indicated that human genetics contributes little to the models, whereas socio-demographic and environmental factors have greater influence(1). Recent evidence suggests the importance of the gut microbiota as an environmental factor, and an altered gut microbiota has been linked to metabolic diseases including obesity(2,3), diabetes(4) and cardiovascular disease(5). Here we use shotgun sequencing to characterize the faecal metagenome of 145 European women with normal, impaired or diabetic glucose control. We observe compositional and functional alterations in the metagenomes of women with T2D, and develop a mathematical model based on metagenomic profiles that identified T2D with high accuracy. We applied this model to women with impaired glucose tolerance, and show that it can identify women who have a diabetes-like metabolism. Furthermore, glucose control and medication were unlikely to have major confounding effects. We also applied our model to a recently described Chinese cohort(4) and show that the discriminant metagenomicmarkers for T2D differ between the European and Chinese cohorts. Therefore, metagenomic predictive tools for T2D should be specific for the age and geographical location of the populations studied.","[Karlsson, Fredrik H.; Nookaew, Intawat; Nielsen, Jens] Chalmers, Dept Chem & Biol Engn, SE-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Tremaroli, Valentina; Bergstrom, Goran; Behre, Carl Johan; Fagerberg, Bjorn; Backhed, Fredrik] Univ Gothenburg, Inst Med, Dept Mol & Clin Med, Wallenberg Lab, SE-41345 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Tremaroli, Valentina; Bergstrom, Goran; Behre, Carl Johan; Fagerberg, Bjorn; Backhed, Fredrik] Univ Gothenburg, Inst Med, Dept Mol & Clin Med, Sahlgrenska Ctr Cardiovasc & Metab Res, SE-41345 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Backhed, Fredrik] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Hlth Sci, Novo Nordisk Fdn Ctr Basic Metab Res, Sect Metab Receptol & Enteroendocrinol, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark","Nielsen, J (reprint author), Chalmers, Dept Chem & Biol Engn, SE-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden.",nielsenj@chalmers.se; fredrik.backhed@wlab.gu.se,,"Bergstrom, Goran/0000-0003-4289-5722; Karlsson, Fredrik/0000-0003-4377-6514; Nielsen, Jens/0000-0002-9955-6003; Backhed, Fredrik/0000-0002-4871-8818","Swedish Research Council; NovoNordisk foundation; Torsten Soderberg's foundation; Ragnar Soderberg's foundation; Swedish Diabetes foundation; Swedish Heart Lung Foundation; IngaBritt och Arne Lundbergs foundation; Chalmers foundation; Bioinformatics Infrastructure for Life Sciences (BILS); Knut and Alice Wallenberg foundation; Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research; AstraZeneca R&D Molndal, Sweden; Region Vastra Gotaland; Sahlgrenska University Hospital","We would like to acknowledge R.

However, little is known about the ontogenetic origin of this capacity. Here we track the development of vocal combinatorial capacity in three species of vocal learners, combining an experimental approach in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) with an analysis of natural development of vocal transitions in Bengalese finches (Lonchura striata domestica) and pre-lingual human infants. We find a common, stepwise pattern of acquiring vocal transitions across species. In our first study, juvenile zebra finches were trained to perform one song and then the training target was altered, prompting the birds to swap syllable order, or insert a new syllable into a string. All birds solved these permutation tasks in a series of steps, gradually approximating the target sequence by acquiring new pairwise syllable transitions, sometimes too slowly to accomplish the task fully. Similarly, in the more complex songs of Bengalese finches, branching points and bidirectional transitions in song syntax were acquired in a stepwise fashion, starting from a more restrictive set of vocal transitions. The babbling of pre-lingual human infants showed a similar pattern: instead of a single developmental shift from reduplicated to variegated babbling (that is, from repetitive to diverse sequences), we observed multiple shifts, where each new syllable type slowly acquired a diversity of pairwise transitions, asynchronously over development. Collectively, these results point to a common generative process that is conserved across species, suggesting that the long-noted gap between perceptual versus motor combinatorial capabilities in human infants(1) may arise partly from the challenges in constructing new pairwise vocal transitions.","[Lipkind, Dina; Feher, Olga; Tchernichovski, Ofer] CUNY Hunter Coll, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Lipkind, Dina; Feher, Olga; Ravbar, Primoz; Tchernichovski, Ofer] CUNY City Coll, Dept Biol, New York, NY 10031 USA; [Marcus, Gary F.; Bemis, Douglas K.] NYU, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Sasahara, Kazutoshi; Takahasi, Miki; Suzuki, Kenta; Okanoya, Kazuo] RIKEN Brain Sci Inst, Lab Biolinguist, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Jacoby, Nori] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Interdisciplinary Ctr Neural Computat, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel; [Jacoby, Nori] Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Mus, IL-5290002 Ramat Gan, Israel; [Suzuki, Kenta; Okanoya, Kazuo] JST ERATO Okanoya Emot Informat Project, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Feher, Olga; Ravbar, Primoz; Tchernichovski, Ofer] CUNY, Grad Ctr, New York, NY 10016 USA","Lipkind, D (reprint author), CUNY Hunter Coll, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10065 USA.",dina.lipkind@gmail.com,,"Tchernichovski, Ofer/0000-0001-6788-614X","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan; US Public Health Service grant","We thank J.

A large body of evidence indicates that oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) acts as such a break, withdrawing cells from the proliferative pool almost irreversibly, thus crafting a vital pathophysiological mechanism that protects against cancer(1-5). Despite the widespread contribution of OIS to the cessation of tumorigenic expansion in animal models and humans, we have only just begun to define the underlying mechanism and identify key players(6). Although deregulation of metabolism is intimately linked to the proliferative capacity of cells(7-10), and senescent cells are thought to remain metabolically active(11), little has been investigated in detail about the role of cellular metabolism in OIS. Here we show, by metabolic profiling and functional perturbations, that the mitochondrial gatekeeper pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is a crucial mediator of senescence induced by BRAF(V600E), an oncogene commonly mutated in melanoma and other cancers. BRAF(V600E)-induced senescence was accompanied by simultaneous suppression of the PDH-inhibitory enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) and induction of the PDH-activating enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase 2 (PDP2). The resulting combined activation of PDH enhanced the use of pyruvate in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, causing increased respiration and redox stress. Abrogation of OIS, a rate-limiting step towards oncogenic transformation, coincided with reversion of these processes. Further supporting a crucial role of PDH in OIS, enforced normalization of either PDK1 or PDP2 expression levels inhibited PDH and abrogated OIS, thereby licensing BRAF(V600E)-driven melanoma development. Finally, depletion of PDK1 eradicated melanoma subpopulations resistant to targeted BRAF inhibition, and caused regression of established melanomas. These results reveal a mechanistic relationship between OIS and a key metabolic signalling axis, which may be exploited therapeutically.","[Kaplon, Joanna; Meissl, Katrin; Peeper, Daniel S.] Netherlands Canc Inst, Div Mol Oncol, NL-1066 CX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Zheng, Liang; Chaneton, Barbara; Mackay, Gillian; Gottlieb, Eyal] Canc Res UK, Beatson Inst Canc Res, Glasgow G61 1BD, Lanark, Scotland; [Selivanov, Vitaly A.; Cascante, Marta] Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; [Selivanov, Vitaly A.; Cascante, Marta] Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, IBUB, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; [Selivanov, Vitaly A.; Cascante, Marta] Inst Invest Biomed August Pi & Sunyer IDIBAPS, Barcelona 08036, Spain; [van der Burg, Sjoerd H.; Verdegaal, Elizabeth M.

Alterations in ILC responses are associated with multiple chronic human diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, implicating a role for ILCs in disease pathogenesis(3,8,11-13). Owing to an inability to target ILCs selectively, experimental studies assessing ILC function have predominantly used mice lacking adaptive immune cells(1-10). However, in lymphocyte-sufficient hosts ILCs are vastly outnumbered by CD4(+) T cells, which express similar profiles of effector cytokines. Therefore, the function of ILCs in the presence of adaptive immunity and their potential to influence adaptive immune cell responses remain unknown. To test this, we used genetic or antibody-mediated depletion strategies to target murine ILCs in the presence of an adaptive immune system. We show that loss of retinoic-acid-receptor-related orphan receptor-gamma t-positive (ROR gamma t(+)) ILCs was associated with dysregulated adaptive immune cell responses against commensal bacteria and low-grade systemic inflammation. Remarkably, ILC-mediated regulation of adaptive immune cells occurred independently of interleukin (IL)-17A, IL-22 or IL-23. Genome-wide transcriptional profiling and functional analyses revealed that ROR gamma t(+) ILCs express major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) and can process and present antigen. However, rather than inducing T-cell proliferation, ILCs acted to limit commensal bacteria-specific CD4(+) T-cell responses. Consistent with this, selective deletion of MHCII in murine ROR gamma t(+) ILCs resulted in dysregulated commensal bacteria-dependent CD4(+) T-cell responses that promoted spontaneous intestinal inflammation. These data identify that ILCs maintain intestinal homeostasis through MHCII-dependent interactions with CD4(+) T cells that limit pathological adaptive immune cell responses to commensal bacteria.","[Hepworth, Matthew R.; Fung, Thomas C.; Sonnenberg, Gregory F.] Univ Penn, Dept Med, Perelman Sch Med, Div Gastroenterol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Hepworth, Matthew R.; Monticelli, Laurel A.; Fung, Thomas C.; Crawford, Alison; Angelosanto, Jill M.; Wherry, E.

To prevent cholesterol overload, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters mediate cholesterol efflux from the cells to apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) and the apoA-I-containing high-density lipoprotein (HDL)(1-3). Maintaining efficient cholesterol efflux is essential for normal cellular function(4-6). However, the role of cholesterol efflux in angiogenesis and the identity of its local regulators are poorly understood. Here we show that apoA-I binding protein (AIBP) accelerates cholesterol efflux from endothelial cells to HDL and thereby regulates angiogenesis. AIBP- and HDL-mediated cholesterol depletion reduces lipid rafts, interferes with VEGFR2 (also known as KDR) dimerization and signalling and inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor-induced angiogenesis in vitro and mouse aortic neovascularization ex vivo. Notably, Aibp, a zebrafish homologue of human AIBP, regulates the membrane lipid order in embryonic zebrafish vasculature and functions as a non-cell-autonomous regulator of angiogenesis. aibp knockdown results in dysregulated sprouting/branching angiogenesis, whereas forced Aibp expression inhibits angiogenesis. Dysregulated angiogenesis is phenocopied in Abca1 (also known as Abca1a) Abcg1-deficient embryos, and cholesterol levels are increased in Aibp-deficient and Abca1Abcg1-deficient embryos. Our findings demonstrate that secreted AIBP positively regulates cholesterol efflux from endothelial cells and that effective cholesterol efflux is critical for proper angiogenesis.","[Fang, Longhou; Choi, Soo-Ho; Baek, Ji Sun; Liu, Chao; Almazan, Felicidad; Wiesner, Philipp; Taleb, Adam; Deer, Elena; Pattison, Jennifer; Li, Andrew C.; Miller, Yury I.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Ulrich, Florian; Torres-Vazquez, Jesus] NYU, Langone Med Ctr, Skirball Inst Biomol Med, Helen L & Martin S Kimmel Ctr Biol & Med, New York, NY 10016 USA","Miller, YI (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Med, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",yumiller@ucsd.edu,"Fang, Longhou/G-6582-2013","Fang, Longhou/0000-0003-1653-5221","NIH [HL093767, HL055798, HL114734]; UC Tobacco-Related Disease Program [18FT-0137]; UCSD [P30NS047101]","We thank D.

The structure of CmoA, a member of the SAM-dependent methyltransferase superfamily, revealed a ligand consistent with Cx-SAM in the catalytic site.

A second member of the SAM-dependent methyltransferase superfamily, CmoB, recognizes Cx-SAM and acts as a carboxymethyltransferase to convert 5-hydroxyuridine into 5-oxyacetyl uridine at the wobble position of multiple tRNAs in Gram-negative bacteria(1), resulting in expanded codon-recognition properties(2,3). CmoA and CmoB represent the first documented synthase and transferase for Cx-SAM. These findings reveal new functional diversity in the SAM-dependent methyltransferase superfamily and expand the metabolic and biological contributions of SAM-based biochemistry. These discoveries highlight the value of structural genomics approaches in identifying ligands within the context of their physiologically relevant macromolecular binding partners, and in revealing their functions.","[Kim, Jungwook; Bonanno, Jeffrey B.; Tang, Xiangying; Al-Obaidi, Nawar F.; Patskovsky, Yury; Almo, Steven C.] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Biochem, Bronx, NY 10461 USA; [Xiao, Hui] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Pathol, Bronx, NY 10461 USA; [Kalyanaraman, Chakrapani; Jacobson, Matthew P.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pharmaceut Chem, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Brown, Shoshana; Babbitt, Patricia C.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Bioengn & Therapeut Sci, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Lee, Young-Sam] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Biol, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Almo, Steven C.] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Bronx, NY 10461 USA","Kim, J (reprint author), Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Biochem, Bronx, NY 10461 USA.",jungwook.kim@einstein.yu.edu; steve.almo@einstein.yu.edu,,"Jacobson, Matthew/0000-0001-6262-655X","US National Institutes of Health [GM094662, GM093342]; Albert Einstein Cancer Center; National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) [P30-EB-009998]; US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-AC02-98CH10886]","We thank J.

Here we present the draft assembly of the 20-gigabase genome of Norway spruce (Picea abies), the first available for any gymnosperm. The number of well-supported genes (28,354) is similar to the >100 times smaller genome of Arabidopsis thaliana, and there is no evidence of a recent whole-genome duplication in the gymnosperm lineage. Instead, the large genome size seems to result from the slow and steady accumulation of a diverse set of long-terminal repeat transposable elements, possibly owing to the lack of an efficient elimination mechanism. Comparative sequencing of Pinus sylvestris, Abies sibirica, Juniperus communis, Taxus baccata and Gnetum gnemon reveals that the transposable element diversity is shared among extant conifers. Expression of 24-nucleotide small RNAs, previously implicated in transposable element silencing, is tissue-specific and much lower than in other plants. We further identify numerous long (>10,000 base pairs) introns, gene-like fragments, uncharacterized long non-coding RNAs and short RNAs. This opens up new genomic avenues for conifer forestry and breeding.","[Nystedt, Bjorn; Sherwood, Ellen] Stockholm Univ, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Sci Life Lab, S-17121 Solna, Sweden; [Street, Nathaniel R.;

Such mixed selectivity is highly heterogeneous, seemingly disordered and therefore difficult to interpret. We analysed the neural activity recorded in monkeys during an object sequence memory task to identify a role of mixed selectivity in subserving the cognitive functions ascribed to the PFC. We show that mixed selectivity neurons encode distributed information about all task-relevant aspects. Each aspect can be decoded from the population of neurons even when single-cell selectivity to that aspect is eliminated. Moreover, mixed selectivity offers a significant computational advantage over specialized responses in terms of the repertoire of input-output functions implementable by readout neurons. This advantage originates from the highly diverse nonlinear selectivity to mixtures of task-relevant variables, a signature of high-dimensional neural representations. Crucially, this dimensionality is predictive of animal behaviour as it collapses in error trials. Our findings recommend a shift of focus for future studies from neurons that have easily interpretable response tuning to the widely observed, but rarely analysed, mixed selectivity neurons.","[Rigotti, Mattia; Barak, Omri; Fusi, Stefano] Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, Ctr Theoret Neurosci, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Rigotti, Mattia; Wang, Xiao-Jing; Daw, Nathaniel D.] NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Rigotti, Mattia; Daw, Nathaniel D.] NYU, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Warden, Melissa R.; Miller, Earl K.] MIT, Picower Inst Learning & Memory, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Warden, Melissa R.; Miller, Earl K.] MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Warden, Melissa R.] Stanford Univ, Dept Bioengn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Wang, Xiao-Jing] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Kavli Inst Neurosci, New Haven, CT 06525 USA","Fusi, S (reprint author), Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, Ctr Theoret Neurosci, 630 W 168th St, New York, NY 10032 USA.",sf2237@columbia.edu,"; Fusi, Stefano/E-9109-2011; Wang, Xiao-Jing/D-2722-2009; Warden, Melissa/M-9300-2016","Barak, Omri/0000-0002-7894-6344; Fusi, Stefano/0000-0002-3035-6652; Warden, Melissa/0000-0003-2240-3997; Rigotti, Mattia/0000-0001-6466-2810",Gatsby Foundation; Swartz Foundation; Kavli Foundation; Swiss National Science Foundation [PBSKP3-133357]; Janggen-Poehn Foundation; McKnight Foundation; McDonnell Foundation; NIMH [5-R37-MH087027-04]; Picower Foundation; Brain & Behavior Research Foundation; NARSAD,"We are grateful to L.F.

Like conventional neutron stars in the form of radio pulsars, magnetars exhibit 'glitches' during which angular momentum is believed to be transferred between the solid outer crust and the superfluid component of the inner crust(2-4). The several hundred observed glitches in radio pulsars(5,6) and magnetars(7) have involved a sudden spin-up (increase in the angular velocity) of the star, presumably because the interior superfluid was rotating faster than the crust. Here we report X-ray timing observations of the magnetar 1E 2259+586 (ref. 8), which exhibited a clear 'anti-glitch'-a sudden spin-down. We show that this event, like some previous magnetar spin-up glitches(9), was accompanied by multiple X-ray radiative changes and a significant spin-down rate change. Such behaviour is not predicted by models of neutron star spin-down and, if of internal origin, is suggestive of differential rotation in the magnetar, supporting the need for a rethinking of glitch theory for all neutron stars(10,11).","[Archibald, R.

In previous studies (see, for example, refs 1-8), it proved difficult to realize superlattices with short periodicities and weak disorder, and most of their observed features could be explained in terms of cyclotron orbits commensurate with the superlattice(1-4). Evidence for the formation of superlattice mini-bands (forming a fractal spectrum known as Hofstadter's butterfly(9)) has been limited to the observation of new low-field oscillations(5) and an internal structure within Landau levels(6-8). Here we report transport properties of graphene placed on a boron nitride substrate and accurately aligned along its crystallographic directions. The substrate's moire potential(10-12) acts as a superlattice and leads to profound changes in the graphene's electronic spectrum. Second-generation Dirac points(13-22) appear as pronounced peaks in resistivity, accompanied by reversal of the Hall effect. The latter indicates that the effective sign of the charge carriers changes within graphene's conduction and valence bands. Strong magnetic fields lead to Zak-type cloning(23) of the third generation of Dirac points, which are observed as numerous neutrality points in fields where a unit fraction of the flux quantum pierces the superlattice unit cell. Graphene superlattices such as this one provide a way of studying the rich physics expected in incommensurable quantum systems(7-9,22-24) and illustrate the possibility of controllably modifying the electronic spectra of two-dimensional atomic crystals by varying their crystallographic alignment within van der Waals heterostuctures(25).","[Ponomarenko, L.

In two dimensions, electrons moving through a magnetic field also develop a quantized energy spectrum, consisting of highly degenerate Landau energy levels. When subject to both a magnetic field and a periodic electrostatic potential, two-dimensional systems of electrons exhibit a self-similar recursive energy spectrum(1). Known as Hofstadter's butterfly, this complex spectrum results from an interplay between the characteristic lengths associated with the two quantizing fields(1-10), and is one of the first quantum fractals discovered in physics. In the decades since its prediction, experimental attempts to study this effect have been limited by difficulties in reconciling the two length scales. Typical atomic lattices (with periodicities of less than one nanometre) require unfeasibly large magnetic fields to reach the commensurability condition, and in artificially engineered structures (with periodicities greater than about 100 nanometres) the corresponding fields are too small to overcome disorder completely(11-17). Here we demonstrate that moire superlattices arising in bilayer graphene coupled to hexagonal boron nitride provide a periodic modulation with ideal length scales of the order of ten nanometres, enabling unprecedented experimental access to the fractal spectrum. We confirm that quantum Hall features associated with the fractal gaps are described by two integer topological quantum numbers, and report evidence of their recursive structure. Observation of a Hofstadter spectrum in bilayer graphene means that it is possible to investigate emergent behaviour within a fractal energy landscape in a system with tunable internal degrees of freedom.","[Dean, C.

Deciphering the deep Arctic Ocean's palaeo-oceanographic history is a crucial part of understanding its role in climatic change. Here we show that sedimentary ratios of the radionuclides thorium-230 (Th-230) and protactinium-231 (Pa-231), which are produced in sea water and removed by particle scavenging on timescales of decades to centuries, respectively(4), record consistent evidence for the export of 231Pa from the deep Arctic and may indicate continuous deep-water exchange between the Arctic and Atlantic oceans throughout the past 35,000 years. Seven well-dated box-core records provide a comprehensive overview of Pa-231 and Th-230 burial in Arctic sediments during glacial, deglacial and interglacial conditions. Sedimentary Pa-231/Th-230 ratios decrease nearly linearly with increasing water depth above the core sites, indicating efficient particle scavenging in the upper water column and greater influence of removal by lateral transport at depth. Although the measured Th-230 burial is in balance with its production in Arctic sea water, integrated depth profiles for all time intervals reveal a deficit in Pa-231 burial that can be balanced only by lateral export in the water column. Because no enhanced sink for Pa-231 has yet been found in the Arctic, our records suggest that deep-water exchange through the Fram strait may export Pa-231. Such export may have continued for the past 35,000 years, suggesting a century-scale replacement time for deep waters in the Arctic Ocean since the most recent glaciation and a persistent contribution of Arctic waters to the global ocean circulation.","[Hoffmann, Sharon S.; McManus, Jerry F.] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Curry, William B.; Brown-Leger, L.

In the Solar System, Venus has a similar size and bulk composition to those of Earth, but it lacks water(1-3). Because a richer variety of exoplanets is expected to be discovered, prediction of their atmospheres and surface environments requires a general framework for planetary evolution. Here we show that terrestrial planets can be divided into two distinct types on the basis of their evolutionary history during solidification from the initially hot molten state expected from the standard formation model(4,5). Even if, apart from their orbits, they were identical just after formation, the solidified planets can have different characteristics. A type I planet, which is formed beyond a certain critical distance from the host star, solidifies within several million years. If the planet acquires water during formation, most of this water is retained and forms the earliest oceans. In contrast, on a type II planet, which is formed inside the critical distance, a magma ocean can be sustained for longer, even with a larger initial amount of water. Its duration could be as long as 100 million years if the planet is formed together with a mass of water comparable to the total inventory of the modern Earth. Hydrodynamic escape desiccates type II planets during the slow solidification process. Although Earth is categorized as type I, it is not clear which type Venus is because its orbital distance is close to the critical distance. However, because the dryness of the surface and mantle predicted for type II planets is consistent with the characteristics of Venus, it may be representative of type II planets. Also, future observations may have a chance to detect not only terrestrial exoplanets covered with water ocean but also those covered with magma ocean around a young star.","[Hamano, Keiko; Abe, Yutaka; Genda, Hidenori] Univ Tokyo, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Genda, Hidenori] Tokyo Inst Technol, Earth Life Sci Inst, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1528551, Japan","Hamano, K (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",keiko@eps.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Genda, Hidenori/A-7858-2014; Abe, Yutaka/I-1933-2012",,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology [23103003]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [23340168, 22740291]","We thank J.F.

The absence of crown catarrhine fossils older than similar to 20 million years (Myr) has stood in stark contrast to molecular divergence estimates of similar to 25-30 Myr for the split between Cercopithecoidea (Old World monkeys) and Hominoidea (apes), implying long ghost lineages for both clades(2-4). Here we describe the oldest known fossil 'ape', represented by a partial mandible preserving dental features that place it with 'nyanzapithecine' stem hominoids. Additionally, we report the oldest stem member of the Old World monkey clade, represented by a lower third molar. Both specimens were recovered from a precisely dated 25.2-Myr-old stratum in the Rukwa Rift, a segment of the western branch of the East African Rift in Tanzania. These finds extend the fossil record of apes and Old World monkey swell into the Oligocene epoch of Africa, suggesting a possible link between diversification of crown catarrhines and changes in the African landscape brought about by previously unrecognized tectonic activity(5) in the East African rift system.","[Stevens, Nancy J.; O'Connor, Patrick M.; Krause, Cornelia] Ohio Univ, Dept Biomed Sci, Heritage Coll Osteopath Med, Athens, OH 45701 USA; [Stevens, Nancy J.; O'Connor, Patrick M.; Krause, Cornelia] Ohio Univ, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Studies, Athens, OH 45701 USA; [Seiffert, Erik R.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Anat Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Roberts, Eric M.] James Cook Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Schmitz, Mark D.] Boise State Univ, Sch Geosci, Boise, ID 83725 USA; [Gorscak, Eric] Ohio Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Athens, OH 45701 USA; [Ngasala, Sifa] Michigan State Univ, Dept Geol Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Hieronymus, Tobin L.] Northeast Ohio Med Univ, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, Rootstown, OH 44272 USA; [Temu, Joseph] Tanzania Antiqu Unit, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania","Stevens, NJ (reprint author), Ohio Univ, Dept Biomed Sci, Heritage Coll Osteopath Med, Athens, OH 45701 USA.",stevensn@ohio.edu,"Stevens, Nancy/E-6928-2013; Roberts, Eric/J-1836-2014; OConnor, Patrick/I-9383-2012; Schmitz, Mark/A-2540-2012","Roberts, Eric/0000-0002-8583-7437; OConnor, Patrick/0000-0002-6762-3806; Hieronymus, Tobin/0000-0002-0483-5350","Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology; US National Science Foundation [EAR-0617561, EAR/IF-0933619, BCS-1127164]; National Geographic Society (CRE); Louis B.

Low temperatures suppress the activity of soil biota, retarding decomposition and nitrogen release, which limits plant and microbial growth(3). Warming initially accelerates decomposition(4-6), increasing nitrogen availability, productivity and woody-plant dominance(3,7). However, these responses may be transitory, because coupled abiotic-biotic feedback loops that alter soil-temperature dynamics and change the structure and activity of soil communities, can develop(8,9). Here we report the results of a two-decade summer warming experiment in an Alaskan tundra ecosystem. Warming increased plant biomass and woody dominance, indirectly increased winter soil temperature, homogenized the soil trophic structure across horizons and suppressed surface-soil-decomposer activity, but did not change total soil carbon or nitrogen stocks, thereby increasing net ecosystem carbon storage. Notably, the strongest effects were in the mineral horizon, where warming increased decomposer activity and carbon stock: a 'biotic awakening' at depth.","[Sistla, Seeta A.; Schimel, Joshua P.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93108 USA; [Moore, John C.; Simpson, Rodney T.] Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Moore, John C.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Sustainabil, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Gough, Laura] Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Biol, Arlington, TX 76019 USA; [Shaver, Gaius R.] Marine Biol Lab, Ctr Ecosyst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA","Sistla, SA (reprint author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93108 USA.",sistla@lifesci.ucsb.edu,"Moore, John/E-9802-2011",,"DOE; Leal Anne Kerry Mertes scholarship; Explorer's Club grant; NSF [OPP-1023524, OPP-0425606, OPP-0909441, OPP-0425827, OPP-0909507]; Arctic LTER program NSF-DEB [1026843]","This research was supported by a DOE Global Change Education Program Graduate Fellowship, a Leal Anne Kerry Mertes scholarship, and Explorer's Club grant to S.A.S., NSF OPP-1023524 to J.P.S., NSF OPP-0425606 and NSF OPP-0909441 to J.C.M., NSF OPP-0425827 and NSF OPP-0909507 to L.G., and the Arctic LTER program NSF-DEB 1026843 to G.R.S.

Digital logic has been used to build small-scale circuits, but other frameworks may be needed for efficient computation in the resource-limited environments of cells(2,3). Here we demonstrate that synthetic analog gene circuits can be engineered to execute sophisticated computational functions in living cells using just three transcription factors. Such synthetic analog gene circuits exploit feedback to implement logarithmically linear sensing, addition, ratiometric and power-law computations. The circuits exhibit Weber's law behaviour as in natural biological systems(4), operate over a wide dynamic range of up to four orders of magnitude and can be designed to have tunable transfer functions. Our circuits can be composed to implement higher-order functions that are well described by both intricate biochemical models and simple mathematical functions. By exploiting analog building-block functions that are already naturally present in cells(3,5), this approach efficiently implements arithmetic operations and complex functions in the logarithmic domain. Such circuits may lead to new applications for synthetic biology and biotechnology that require complex computations with limited parts, need wide-dynamic-range biosensing or would benefit from the fine control of gene expression.","[Daniel, Ramiz; Sarpeshkar, Rahul] MIT, Elect Res Lab, Analog Circuits & Biol Syst Grp, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Daniel, Ramiz; Rubens, Jacob R.; Lu, Timothy K.] MIT, Elect Res Lab, Synthet Biol Grp, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Daniel, Ramiz; Rubens, Jacob R.; Sarpeshkar, Rahul; Lu, Timothy K.] MIT, Synthet Biol Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Rubens, Jacob R.; Sarpeshkar, Rahul; Lu, Timothy K.] MIT, MIT Microbiol Program, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Sarpeshkar, Rahul; Lu, Timothy K.] MIT, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Sarpeshkar, Rahul; Lu, Timothy K.] MIT, MIT Computat & Syst Biol Program, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Sarpeshkar, Rahul] MIT, MIT Biophys Program, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Lu, Timothy K.] MIT, Dept Biol Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Sarpeshkar, R (reprint author), MIT, Elect Res Lab, Analog Circuits & Biol Syst Grp, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",rahuls@mit.edu; timlu@mit.edu,,", /0000-0003-1304-0151; Lu, Timothy/0000-0002-3918-8923",campus collaboration initiative from Lincoln Labs; US National Science Foundation [1124247]; Office of Naval Research [N000141110725],"We would like to thank J.

BAF chromatin-remodelling complexes are polymorphic assemblies that use energy provided by ATP hydrolysis to regulate transcription through the control of chromatin structure(3) and the placement of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) across the genome(4,5). Several proteins dedicated to this multisubunit complex, including BRG1 (also known as SMARCA4) and BAF250a (also known as ARID1A), are mutated at frequencies similar to those of recognized tumour suppressors. In particular, the core ATPase BRG1 is mutated in 5-10% of childhood medulloblastomas(6-9) and more than 15% of Burkitt's lymphomas(10,11). Here we show a previously unknown function of BAF complexes in decatenating newly replicated sister chromatids, a requirement for proper chromosome segregation during mitosis. We find that deletion of Brg1 in mouse cells, as well as the expression of BRG1 point mutants identified in human tumours, leads to anaphase bridge formation (in which sister chromatids are linked by catenated strands of DNA) and a G2/M-phase block characteristic of the decatenation checkpoint. Endogenous BAF complexes interact directly with endogenous topoisomerase II alpha (TOP2A) through BAF250a and are required for the binding of TOP2A to approximately 12,000 sites across the genome. Our results demonstrate that TOP2A chromatin binding is dependent on the ATPase activity of BRG1, which is compromised in oncogenic BRG1 mutants. These studies indicate that the ability of TOP2A to prevent DNA entanglement at mitosis requires BAF complexes and suggest that this activity contributes to the role of BAF subunits as tumour suppressors.","[Dykhuizen, Emily C.; Hargreaves, Diana C.; Miller, Erik L.; Crabtree, Gerald R.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Dykhuizen, Emily C.; Hargreaves, Diana C.; Crabtree, Gerald R.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Miller, Erik L.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Cui, Kairong; Zhao, Keji] NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Korshunov, Andrey] German Canc Res Ctr, CCU Neuropathol, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Kool, Marcel; Pfister, Stefan] German Canc Res Ctr, Div Pediat Neurooncol, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Pfister, Stefan] Univ Heidelberg Hosp, Dept Pediat Oncol, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Cho, Yoon-Jae] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurol & Neurosurg, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Crabtree, GR (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",crabtree@stanford.edu,"Kool, Marcel/H-2541-2013; Pfister, Stefan/F-6860-2013","Pfister, Stefan/0000-0002-5447-5322",NIH; American Cancer Society; Helen Hay Whitney Foundation; NHLBI,"We would like to acknowledge the DNA Sequencing Core facility of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) for sequencing the ChIP-seq libraries.

For more than a century, the vertebrate limb bud has served as a model for studying cell signalling during embryonic development(2). Here we optimize single-cell real-time imaging to delineate the cellular mechanisms for how signalling proteins, such as sonic hedgehog (SHH), that possess membrane-bound covalent lipid modifications traverse long distances within the vertebrate limb bud in vivo. By directly imaging SHH ligand production under native regulatory control in chick (Gallus gallus) embryos, our findings show that SHH is unexpectedly produced in the form of a particle that remains associated with the cell via long cytoplasmic extensions that span several cell diameters. We show that these cellular extensions are a specialized class of actin-based filopodia with novel cytoskeletal features that have not been previously described. Notably, particles containing SHH travel along these extensions with a net anterograde movement within the field of SHH cell signalling. We further show that in SHH-responding cells, specific subsets of SHH co-receptors, including cell adhesion molecule downregulated by oncogenes (CDO) and brother of CDO (BOC), actively distribute and co-localize in specific micro-domains within filopodial extensions, far from the cell body. Stabilized interactions are formed between filopodia containing SHH ligand and those containing co-receptors over a long range. These results suggest that contact-mediated release propagated by specialized filopodia contributes to the delivery of SHH at a distance. Together, these studies identify an important mode of communication between cells that considerably extends our understanding of ligand movement and reception during vertebrate tissue patterning.","[Sanders, Timothy A.; Llagostera, Esther; Barna, Maria] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem & Biophys, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Sanders, Timothy A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Div Neonatol, Dept Pediat, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Llagostera, Esther; Barna, Maria] Stanford Univ, Dept Dev Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Llagostera, Esther; Barna, Maria] Stanford Univ, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Barna, M (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem & Biophys, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA.",mbarna@stanford.edu,,,"Spanish Ministry of Education and Science; Program for Breakthrough Biomedical Research, UCSF; March of Dimes Basil O'Connor Scholar Research Award; National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Disease, part of NIH [NIH R21AR062262]","We thank D.

Oncogenic Ras proteins have been shown to stimulate macropinocytosis but the functional contribution of this uptake mechanism to the transformed phenotype remains unknown(1-3). Here we show that Ras-transformed cells use macropinocytosis to transport extracellular protein into the cell. The internalized protein undergoes proteolytic degradation, yielding amino acids including glutamine that can enter central carbon metabolism. Accordingly, the dependence of Ras-transformed cells on free extracellular glutamine for growth can be suppressed by the macropinocytic uptake of protein. Consistent with macropinocytosis representing an important route of nutrient uptake in tumours, its pharmacological inhibition compromises the growth of Ras-transformed pancreatic tumour xenografts. These results identify macropinocytosis as a mechanism by which cancer cells support their unique metabolic needs and point to the possible exploitation of this process in the design of anticancer therapies.","[Commisso, Cosimo; Soydaner-Azeloglu, Rengin G.; Grabocka, Elda; Bar-Sagi, Dafna] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Pharmacol, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Davidson, Shawn M.; Vander Heiden, Matthew G.] MIT, Koch Inst Integrat Canc Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Davidson, Shawn M.; Vander Heiden, Matthew G.] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Parker, Seth J.; Metallo, Christian M.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Bioengn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Kamphorst, Jurre J.; Hackett, Sean; Nofal, Michel; Rabinowitz, Joshua D.] Princeton Univ, Carl Icahn Lab, Lewis Sigler Inst Integrat Genom, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Drebin, Jeffrey A.] Hosp Univ Penn, Dept Surg, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Thompson, Craig B.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Canc Biol & Genet Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Vander Heiden, Matthew G.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Bar-Sagi, D (reprint author), NYU, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Pharmacol, New York, NY 10016 USA.",dafna.bar-sagi@nyumc.org,,"Kamphorst, Jurre/0000-0002-2042-5474","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R01CA055360, 5 P30CA016087-32]; Canadian Institutes of Health Research; AACR provided by the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network; Burroughs Wellcome Fund; Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation; Smith Family; Stern family; Broad Institute; National Cancer Institute [P01-CA117969, P30-CA14051-39]; Hope Funds for Cancer Research Fellowship [HFCR-11-03-01]; Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C) Pancreatic Cancer Dream Team Award; NICHD","We are grateful to members of the Bar-Sagi laboratory for their comments and discussions, and N.

Correct localization and signalling by farnesylated KRAS is regulated by the prenyl-binding protein PDE delta, which sustains the spatial organization of KRAS by facilitating its diffusion in the cytoplasm(9-11). Here we report that interfering with binding of mammalian PDEd to KRAS by means of small molecules provides a novel opportunity to suppress oncogenic RAS signalling by altering its localization to endomembranes. Biochemical screening and subsequent structure-based hit optimization yielded inhibitors of the KRAS-PDE delta interaction that selectively bind to the prenyl-binding pocket of PDE delta with nanomolar affinity, inhibit oncogenic RAS signalling and suppress in vitro and in vivo proliferation of human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells that are dependent on oncogenic KRAS.

The mature human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) capsid is best described by a 'fullerene cone' model(2,3), in which hexamers of the capsid protein are linked to form a hexagonal surface lattice that is closed by incorporating 12 capsid-protein pentamers. HIV-1 capsid protein contains an amino-terminal domain (NTD) comprising seven alpha-helices and a beta-hairpin(4,5), a carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) comprising four alpha-helices(6,7), and a flexible linker with a 3(10)-helix connecting the two structural domains(8). Structures of the capsid-protein assembly units have been determined by X-ray crystallography(9,10); however, structural information regarding the assembled capsid and the contacts between the assembly units is incomplete. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of a tubular HIV-1 capsid-protein assembly at 8 angstrom resolution and the three-dimensional structure of a native HIV-1 core by cryo-electron tomography. The structure of the tubular assembly shows, at the three-fold interface(11), a three-helix bundle with critical hydrophobic interactions. Mutagenesis studies confirm that hydrophobic residues in the centre of the three-helix bundle are crucial for capsid assembly and stability, and for viral infectivity. The cryo-electron-microscopy structures enable modelling by large-scale molecular dynamics simulation, resulting in all-atom models for the hexamer-of-hexamer and pentamer-of-hexamer elements as well as for the entire capsid. Incorporation of pentamers results in closer trimer contacts and induces acute surface curvature. The complete atomic HIV-1 capsid model provides a platform for further studies of capsid function and for targeted pharmacological intervention.","[Zhao, Gongpu; Meng, Xin; Ning, Jiying; Ahn, Jinwoo; Gronenborn, Angela M.; Zhang, Peijun] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Biol Struct, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Zhao, Gongpu; Yufenyuy, Ernest L.; Meng, Xin; Ning, Jiying; Ahn, Jinwoo; Gronenborn, Angela M.; Aiken, Christopher; Zhang, Peijun] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Pittsburgh Ctr HIV Prot Interact, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Perilla, Juan R.; Schulten, Klaus] Univ Illinois, Dept Phys, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Perilla, Juan R.; Schulten, Klaus] Univ Illinois, Beckman Inst, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Yufenyuy, Ernest L.; Aiken, Christopher] Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol Microbiol & Immunol, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [Chen, Bo] Univ Cent Florida, Dept Phys, Orlando, FL 32816 USA; [Zhang, Peijun] Univ Pittsburgh, Swanson Sch Engn, Dept Mech Engn & Mat Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA","Zhang, PJ (reprint author), Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Biol Struct, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",kschulte@ks.uiuc.edu; chris.aiken@vanderbilt.edu; pez7@pitt.edu,"Chen, Bo/F-3573-2015; NING, JIYING/L-3899-2016; zhao, gongpu/B-8151-2012","Gronenborn, Angela M/0000-0001-9072-3525; Perilla, Juan/0000-0003-1171-6816","National Institutes of Health [GM082251, GM085043, GM104601]; National Science Foundation [PHY0822613, MCB0744057, OCI 07-25070]","We thank P.

Numerous microorganisms evolved to assimilate nitrate and use it as a major source of mineral nitrogen uptake(1). Nitrate, which is central in nitrogen metabolism, is first reduced to nitrite (NO2-) through a two-electron reduction reaction(2,3). The accumulation of cellular nitrite can be harmful because nitrite can be reduced to the cytotoxic nitric oxide. Instead, nitrite is rapidly removed from the cell by channels and transporters, or reduced to ammonium or dinitrogen through the action of assimilatory enzymes(3). Despite decades of effort no structure is currently available for any nitrate transport protein and the mechanism by which nitrate is transported remains largely unknown. Here we report the structure of a bacterial nitrate/nitrite transport protein, NarK, from Escherichia coli, with and without substrate. The structures reveal a positively charged substrate-translocation pathway lacking protonatable residues, suggesting that NarK functions as a nitrate/nitrite exchanger and that protons are unlikely to be co-transported. Conserved arginine residues comprise the substrate-binding pocket, which is formed by association of helices from the two halves of NarK. Key residues that are important for substrate recognition and transport are identified and related to extensive mutagenesis and functional studies. We propose that NarK exchanges nitrate for nitrite by a rocker switch mechanism facilitated by inter-domain hydrogen bond networks.","[Zheng, Hongjin; Wisedchaisri, Goragot; Gonen, Tamir] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA","Gonen, T (reprint author), Howard Hughes Med Inst, Janelia Farm Res Campus,19700 Helix Dr, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA.",gonent@janelia.hhmi.org,,,"Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute","We thank E.

Specific antibiotics targeting mitochondrial translation and ethidium bromide (which impairs mitochondrial DNA transcription) pharmacologically mimic mrp knockdown and extend worm lifespan by inducing mitonuclear protein imbalance, a stoichiometric imbalance between nuclear and mitochondrially encoded proteins.

An example is the eleven-year solar cycle, which shows spatial coherence over the entire solar surface(3-5). The difficulty in understanding the emergence of this large-scale organization is that whereas at low conductivity (measured by the magnetic Reynolds number, Rm) dynamo fields are well organized, at high Rm their structure is dominated by rapidly varying small-scale fluctuations. This arises because the smallest scales have the highest rate of strain, and can amplify magnetic field most efficiently. Therefore most of the effort to find flows whose large-scale dynamo properties persist at high Rm has been frustrated. Here we report high-resolution simulations of a dynamo that can generate organized fields at high Rm; indeed, the generation mechanism, which involves the interaction between helical flows and shear, only becomes effective at large Rm. The shear does not enhance generation at large scales, as is commonly thought; instead it reduces generation at small scales. The solution consists of propagating dynamo waves, whose existence was postulated more than 60 years ago(6) and which have since been used to model the solar cycle(7).","[Tobias, S.

Frozen-in field lines, however, preclude the rapid changes in magnetic topology observed at high conductivities, as in solar flares(2,3). Microphysical plasma processes are a proposed explanation of the observed high rates(4-6), but it is an open question whether such processes can rapidly reconnect astrophysical flux structures much greater in extent than several thousand ion gyroradii. An alternative explanation(7,8) is that turbulent Richardson advection(9) brings field lines implosively together from distances far apart to separations of the order of gyroradii. Here we report an analysis of a simulation of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence at high conductivity that exhibits Richardson dispersion. This effect of advection in rough velocity fields, which appear non-differentiable in space, leads to line motions that are completely indeterministic or 'spontaneously stochastic', as predicted in analytical studies(10-13). The turbulent breakdown of standard flux freezing at scales greater than the ion gyroradius can explain fast reconnection of very large-scale flux structures, both observed (solar flares and coronal mass ejections) and predicted (the inner heliosheath, accretion disks, gamma-ray bursts and so on). For laminar plasma flows with smooth velocity fields or for low turbulence intensity, stochastic flux freezing reduces to the usual frozen-in condition.

He proposed that a flat slab of left-handed material possessing an isotropic refractive index of 21 could act like an imaging lens in free space. Left-handed materials do not occur naturally, and it has only recently become possible to achieve a left-handed response using metamaterials, that is, electromagnetic structures engineered on subwavelength scales to elicit tailored polarization responses. So far, left-handed responses have typically been implemented using resonant metamaterials composed of periodic arrays of unit cells containing inductive-capacitive resonators and conductive wires. Negative refractive indices that are isotropic in two(2) or three(3) dimensions at microwave frequencies have been achieved in resonant metamaterials with centimetre-scale features. Scaling the left-handed response to higher frequencies, such as infrared or visible, has been done by shrinking critical dimensions to submicrometre scales by means of top-down nanofabrication(4). This miniaturization has, however, so far been achieved at the cost of reduced unit-cell symmetry, yielding a refractive index that is negative along only one axis. Moreover, lithographic scaling limits have so far precluded the fabrication of resonant metamaterials with left-handed responses at frequencies beyond the visible(5). Here we report the experimental implementation of a bulk metamaterial with a left-handed response to ultraviolet light. The structure, based on stacked plasmonic waveguides(6), yields an omnidirectional left-handed response for transverse magnetic polarization characterized by a negative refractive index. By engineering the structure to have a refractive index close to -1 over a broad angular range, we achieve Veselago flat lensing, in free space, of arbitrarily shaped, two-dimensional objects beyond the near field. We further demonstrate active, all-optical modulation of the image transferred by the flat lens.","[Xu, Ting; Agrawal, Amit; Abashin, Maxim; Lezec, Henri J.] NIST, Ctr Nanoscale Sci & Technol, Gaithersburg, MD 20899 USA; [Xu, Ting; Abashin, Maxim] Univ Maryland, Maryland Nano Ctr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Agrawal, Amit] Syracuse Univ, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Chau, Kenneth J.] Univ British Columbia, Sch Engn, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada","Lezec, HJ (reprint author), NIST, Ctr Nanoscale Sci & Technol, Gaithersburg, MD 20899 USA.",hlezec@nist.gov,"Xu, Ting/D-3921-2013; Agrawal, Amit/C-3728-2009","Xu, Ting/0000-0002-2008-7049; Agrawal, Amit/0000-0001-8230-4603",University of Maryland [70NANB10H193],"We thank A.

The spectroscopic methods of choice are usually circular dichroism and vibrational circular dichroism, methods that are forbidden in the electric dipole approximation(2). The resultant weak effects produce weak signals, and thus require high sample densities. In contrast, nonlinear techniques probing electric-dipole-allowed effects have been used for sensitive chiral analyses of liquid samples(3-7). Here we extend this class of approaches by carrying out nonlinear resonant phase-sensitive microwave spectroscopy of gas phase samples in the presence of an adiabatically switched non-resonant orthogonal electric field; we use this technique to map the enantiomer-dependent sign of an electric dipole Rabi frequency onto the phase of emitted microwave radiation. We outline theoretically how this results in a sensitive and species-selective method for determining the chirality of cold gas-phase molecules, and implement it experimentally to distinguish between the S and R enantiomers of 1,2-propanediol and their racemic mixture. This technique produces a large and definitive signature of chirality, and has the potential to determine the chirality of multiple species in a mixture.","[Patterson, David; Doyle, John M.] Harvard Univ, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Schnell, Melanie] Ctr Free Elect Laser Sci, D-22607 Hamburg, Germany; [Schnell, Melanie] Max Planck Inst Kernphys, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany","Patterson, D (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",dave@cua.harvard.edu,"Schnell, Melanie/D-5329-2014",,,,,25,103,103,13,157,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-May,2013,497,7450,,,,,475,+,,10.1038/nature12150,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,148OG,WOS:000319254000044,23698447.0,No,,,11/20/17,john m.,doyle,na,na,na,na,na

In the lowermost stratosphere, the vertical structure of this quasibiennial oscillation (QBO) is linked to the mean upwelling(2-4), which itself is a key factor in determining stratospheric composition. Evidence for changes in the QBO have until now been equivocal, raising questions as to the extent of stratospheric circulation changes in a global warming context. Here we report an analysis of near-equatorial radiosonde observations for 1953-2012, and reveal a long-term trend of weakening amplitude in the zonal wind QBO in the tropical lower stratosphere. The trend is particularly notable at the 70-hectopascal pressure level (an altitude of about 19 kilometres), where the QBO amplitudes dropped by roughly one-third over the period. This trend is also apparent in the global warming simulations of the four models in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) that realistically simulate the QBO. The weakening is most reasonably explained as resulting from a trend of increased mean tropical upwelling in the lower stratosphere. Almost all comprehensive climate models have projected an intensifying tropical upwelling in global warming scenarios(5-7), but attempts to estimate changes in the upwelling by using observational data have yielded ambiguous, inconclusive or contradictory results(8-10). Our discovery of a weakening trend in the lower-stratosphere QBO amplitude provides strong support for the existence of a long-term trend of enhanced upwelling near the tropical tropopause.","[Kawatani, Yoshio] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Res Inst Global Change, Kanazawa Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan; [Hamilton, Kevin] Univ Hawaii Manoa, SOEST, Int Pacific Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA","Kawatani, Y (reprint author), Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Res Inst Global Change, Kanazawa Ku, 3173-25 Showamachi, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan.",yoskawatani@jamstec.go.jp,,,"Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology through International Pacific Research Center; Ministry of the Environment, Japan [A-1201]; JSPS KAKENHI [23740363, 24340113]; NASA [NNX07AG53G]; NOAA [NA11NMF4320128]; International Pacific Research Center; Data Integration and Analysis System (DIAS) Fund for National Key Technology from MEXT","This work was supported by the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology through its support of the International Pacific Research Center, by the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (A-1201) of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan and by JSPS KAKENHI grant nos 23740363 and 24340113.

In the main olfactory system of mammals, odours are detected by sensory neurons that express a large repertoire of canonical odorant receptors and a much smaller repertoire of trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs)(1-4). Odours are encoded in a combinatorial fashion across glomeruli in the main olfactory bulb, with each glomerulus corresponding to a specific receptor(5-7). The degree to which individual receptor genes contribute to odour perception is unclear. Here we show that genetic deletion of the olfactory Taar gene family, or even a single Taar gene (Taar4), eliminates the aversion that mice display to low concentrations of volatile amines and to the odour of predator urine. Our findings identify a role for the TAARs in olfaction, namely, in the high-sensitivity detection of innately aversive odours.

Previous studies have demonstrated that Sema3a(-/-) mice have multiple developmental defects due to abnormal neuronal innervations(6,7). Here we show in mice that Sema3A is abundantly expressed in bone, and cell-based assays showed that Sema3A affected osteoblast differentiation in a cell-autonomous fashion. Accordingly, Sema3a(-/-) mice had a low bone mass due to decreased bone formation. However, osteoblast-specific Sema3A-deficient mice (Sema3a(coli)(-/-) and Sema3a(osx)(-/-) mice) had normal bone mass, even though the expression of Sema3A in bone was substantially decreased. In contrast, mice lacking Sema3A in neurons (Sema3a(synapsin)(-/-) and Sema3a(nestin)(-/-) mice) had low bone mass, similar to Sema3a(-/-) mice, indicating that neuron-derived Sema3A is responsible for the observed bone abnormalities independent of the local effect of Sema3A in bone. Indeed, the number of sensory innervations of trabecular bone was significantly decreased in Sema3a(synapsin)(-/-) mice, whereas sympathetic innervations of trabecular bone were unchanged. Moreover, ablating sensory nerves decreased bone mass in wild-type mice, whereas it did not reduce the low bone mass in Sema3a(nestin)(-/-) mice further, supporting the essential role of the sensory nervous system in normal bone homeostasis. Finally, neuronal abnormalities in Sema3a(-/-) mice, such as olfactory development, were identified in Sema3a(synasin)(-/-) mice, demonstrating that neuron-derived Sema3A contributes to the abnormal neural development seen in Sema3a(-/-) mice, and indicating that Sema3A produced in neurons regulates neural development in an autocrine manner. This study demonstrates that Sema3A regulates bone remodelling indirectly by modulating sensory nerve development, but not directly by acting on osteoblasts.","[Fukuda, Toru; Takeda, Shu; Ochi, Hiroki; Sunamura, Satoko] Keio Univ, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, Shinjyuku Ku, Tokyo 1608582, Japan; [Xu, Ren; Kimura, Ayako; Ma, Chengshan; Xu, Cheng; Fujita, Koji; Shinomiya, Kenichi; Hirai, Takashi; Asou, Yoshinori; Enomoto, Mitsuhiro; Okawa, Atsushi] Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Dept Orthoped Surg, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138549, Japan; [Xu, Ren; Ma, Chengshan; Xu, Cheng; Fujita, Koji; Okawa, Atsushi] Int Res Ctr Mol Sci Tooth & Bone Dis, Global Ctr Excellence GCOE Program, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138549, Japan; [Sato, Tsuyoshi] Saitama Med Univ, Dept Oral & Maxillofacial Surg, Moroyama, Saitama 3500495, Japan; [Shibata, Shinsuke; Okano, Hideyuki] Keio Univ, Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Shinjyuku Ku, Tokyo 1608582, Japan; [Yoshida, Yutaka; Gu, Zirong] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Dev Biol, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Kimura, Ayako] Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Hard Tissue Genome Res Ctr, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138549, Japan; [Bando, Waka; Itoh, Hiroshi] Keio Univ, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, Sect Nephrol Endocrinol & Metab,Shinjyuku Ku, Tokyo 1608582, Japan","Takeda, S (reprint author), Keio Univ, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, Shinjyuku Ku, Shinanomachi 35, Tokyo 1608582, Japan.",shu-tky@umin.ac.jp,"Shibata, Shinsuke/L-2854-2013; Hidokano, Hideyuki/J-5973-2013",,Funding Program for Next Generation World-Leading Researchers (NEXT Program); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke [NS065048],"We thank M.

Previous studies have shown that CD8(+) T cells persist in genital skin and mucosa at the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ)-the portal of neuronal release of reactivating virus-for prolonged time periods after herpes lesions are cleared(1,2). The phenotype and function of this persistent CD8(+) T-cell population remain unknown. Here, using cell-type-specific laser capture microdissection, transcriptional profiling and T-cell antigen receptor beta-chain (TCR beta) genotyping on sequential genital skin biopsies, we show that CD8 alpha alpha(+) T cells are the dominant resident population of DEJ CD8(+) T cells that persist at the site of previous HSV-2 reactivation. CD8 alpha alpha(+) T cells located at the DEJ lack chemokine-receptor expression required for lymphocyte egress and recirculation, express gene signatures of T-cell activation and antiviral activity, and produce cytolytic granules during clinical and virological quiescent time periods. Sequencing of the TCR beta-chain repertoire reveals that the DEJ CD8 alpha alpha(+) T cells are oligoclonal with diverse usage of TCR variable-beta genes, which differ from those commonly described for mucosa-associated invariant T cells and natural killer T cells. Dominant clonotypes are shown to overlap among multiple recurrences over a period of two-and-a-half years. Episodes of rapid asymptomatic HSV-2 containment were also associated with a high CD8 effector-to-target ratio and focal enrichment of CD8 alpha alpha(+) T cells. These studies indicate that DEJ CD8 alpha alpha(+) T cells are tissue-resident cells that seem to have a fundamental role in immune surveillance and in initial containment of HSV-2 reactivation in human peripheral tissue. Elicitation of CD8 alpha alpha(+) T cells may be a critical component for developing effective vaccines against skin and mucosal infections.","[Zhu, Jia; Kask, Angela S.; Klock, Alexis; Jin, Lei; Diem, Kurt; Koelle, David M.; Wald, Anna; Corey, Lawrence] Univ Washington, Dept Lab Med, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Zhu, Jia; Peng, Tao; Phasouk, Khamsone; Koelle, David M.; Wald, Anna; Corey, Lawrence] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Vaccine & Infect Dis Div, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Peng, Tao; Johnston, Christine; Koelle, David M.; Wald, Anna; Corey, Lawrence] Univ Washington, Dept Med, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Koelle, David M.; Corey, Lawrence] Univ Washington, Dept Pathobiol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Koelle, David M.] Benaroya Res Inst, Seattle, WA 98104 USA; [Wald, Anna] Univ Washington, Dept Epidemiol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Robins, Harlan] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Program Computat Biol, Seattle, WA 98109 USA","Zhu, J (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Lab Med, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",jiazhu@u.washington.edu; lcorey@fhcrc.org,"Wald, Anna/B-6272-2012; Koelle, David/Q-6529-2016","Wald, Anna/0000-0003-3486-6438; Koelle, David/0000-0003-1255-9023","National Institutes of Health [R37AI042528, R01AI04252815, P01AI030731, R56AI093746]; James B.

Previous studies reported that acute lung injury caused by chemical or microbial insults is secondary to the generation of host-derived, oxidized phospholipid that potently stimulates Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-dependent inflammation(1). Subsequently, we reported that Tlr4(-/-) mice are highly refractory to influenza-induced lethality(2), and proposed that therapeutic antagonism of TLR4 signalling would protect against influenza-induced acute lung injury. Here we report that therapeutic administration of Eritoran (also known as E5564)-a potent, well-tolerated, synthetic TLR4 antagonist(3,4)-blocks influenza-induced lethality in mice, as well as lung pathology, clinical symptoms, cytokine and oxidized phospholipid expression, and decreases viral titres. CD14 and TLR2 are also required for Eritoran-mediated protection, and CD14 directly binds Eritoran and inhibits ligand binding to MD2. Thus, Eritoran blockade of TLR signalling represents a novel therapeutic approach for inflammation associated with influenza, and possibly other infections.","[Shirey, Kari Ann; Lai, Wendy; Mistry, Pragnesh; Vogel, Stefanie N.] Univ Maryland, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Scott, Alison J.; Ernst, Robert K.] Univ Maryland, Dept Microbial Pathogenesis, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Lipsky, Michael] Univ Maryland, Dept Pathol, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Pletneva, Lioubov M.; Blanco, Jorge C.

Germline stem and somatic blast cells in newly hatched Caenorhabditis elegans larvae can suspend postembryonic development, which consists of diverse cellular events such as migration, proliferation and differentiation, until the nutritional state becomes favourable (termed L1 diapause(4-6)). Although previous studies showed that the insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signalling (IIS) pathway regulates this developmental quiescence(5-8), the detailed mechanism by which the IIS pathway enables these multipotent cells to respond to nutrient availability is unknown. Here we show in C. elegans that the microRNA (miRNA) miR-235, a sole orthologue of mammalian miR-92 from the oncogenicmiR-17-92 cluster(9,10), acts in the hypodermis and glial cells to arrest postembryonic developmental events in both neuroblasts and mesoblasts. Expression of mir-235 persists during L1 diapause, and decreases upon feeding in a manner dependent on the IIS pathway. Upregulation of one of the miR-235 targets, nhr-91, which encodes an orthologue of mammalian germ cell nuclear factor, is responsible for defects caused by loss of the miRNA. Our findings establish a novel role of a miR-92 orthologue in coupling blast-cell behaviours to the nutritional state.","[Kasuga, Hidefumi; Fukuyama, Masamitsu; Kitazawa, Aya; Kontani, Kenji; Katada, Toshiaki] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Physiol Chem Lab, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan","Fukuyama, M (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Physiol Chem Lab, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",mfukuyam@mol.f.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,,"National Institutes of Health National Center for Research Resources; MITANI Lab through the National Bio-Resource Project of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI [23229001, 23370083]; MEXT KAKENHI [24657081, 23116703]","We thank A.

Most LMNA mutations affect skeletal and cardiac muscle by mechanisms that remain incompletely understood. Loss of structural function and altered interaction of mutant lamins with (tissue-specific) transcription factors have been proposed to explain the tissue-specific phenotypes(1). Here we report in mice that lamin-A/C-deficient (Lmna(-/-)) and Lmna(N195K/N195K) mutant cells have impaired nuclear translocation and downstream signalling of the mechanosensitive transcription factor megakaryoblastic leukaemia 1 (MKL1), a myocardin family member that is pivotal in cardiac development and function(2). Altered nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of MKL1 was caused by altered actin dynamics in Lmna(-/-) and Lmna(N195K/N195K) mutant cells. Ectopic expression of the nuclear envelope protein emerin, which is mislocalized in Lmna mutant cells and also linked to EDMD and DCM, restored MKL1 nuclear translocation and rescued actin dynamics in mutant cells. These findings present a novel mechanism that could provide insight into the disease aetiology for the cardiac phenotype in many laminopathies, whereby lamin A/C and emerin regulate gene expression through modulation of nuclear and cytoskeletal actin polymerization.","[Ho, Chin Yee; Lammerding, Jan] Cornell Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Weill Inst Cell & Mol Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Ho, Chin Yee; Jaalouk, Diana E.; Lammerding, Jan] Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Sch Med, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Vartiainen, Maria K.] Univ Helsinki, Inst Biotechnol, Helsinki 00014, Finland","Lammerding, J (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Weill Inst Cell & Mol Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",jan.lammerding@cornell.edu,"Vartiainen, Maria/F-4767-2013; Lammerding, Jan/A-9498-2016","Vartiainen, Maria/0000-0002-2017-0475; Lammerding, Jan/0000-0003-4335-8611","National Institutes of Health [R01 NS059348, R01 HL082792]; Department of Defense Breast Cancer Idea Award [BC102152]; Progeria Research Foundation [PRF 2011-035]; American Heart Association [09POST2320042]; Academy of Finland; Sigrid Juselius Foundation",We thank C.

Rpt ring assembly is mediated by four chaperones, each binding a distinct Rpt subunit(5-10).

This complex is subject to active dissociation by the chaperones Hsm3, Nas6 and Rpn14. Chaperone-mediated dissociation was abrogated by a non-hydrolysable ATP analogue, indicating that chaperone action is coupled to nucleotide hydrolysis by the Rpt ring. Unexpectedly, synthetic Rpt tail peptides bound alpha-pockets with poor specificity, except for Rpt6, which uniquely bound the alpha 2/alpha 3-pocket. Although the Rpt6 tail is not visualized within an alpha-pocket in mature proteasomes(2-4), it inserts into the alpha 2/alpha 3-pocket in the base-CP complex and is important for complex formation.

Genome-wide association studies of BMD have hitherto focused on BMD as a quantitative trait, yielding common variants of small effects that contribute to the population diversity in BMD1-7. Here we use BMD as a dichotomous trait, searching for variants that may have a direct effect on the risk of pathologically low BMD rather than on the regulation of BMD in the healthy population. Through whole-genome sequencing of Icelandic individuals, we found a rare nonsense mutation within the leucinerich-repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 4 (LGR4) gene (c.376C>T) that is strongly associated with low BMD, and with osteoporotic fractures. This mutation leads to termination of LGR4 at position 126 and fully disrupts its function. The c.376C>T mutation is also associated with electrolyte imbalance, late onset of menarche and reduced testosterone levels, as well as an increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and biliary tract cancer. Interestingly, the phenotype of carriers of the c.376C>T mutation overlaps that of Lgr4 mutant mice.","[Styrkarsdottir, Unnur; Thorleifsson, Gudmar; Sulem, Patrick; Gudbjartsson, Daniel F.; Sigurdsson, Asgeir; Jonasdottir, Aslaug; Jonasdottir, Adalbjorg; Oddsson, Asmundur; Helgason, Agnar; Magnusson, Olafur T.; BragiWalters, G.; Frigge, Michael L.; Helgadottir, Hafdis T.; Johannsdottir, Hrefna; Rafnar, Thorunn; Kong, Augustine; Masson, Gisli; Thorsteinsdottir, Unnur; Stefansson, Kari] deCODE Genet Amgen, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Oddsson, Asmundur] Karolinska Inst, Dept Med Biochem & Biophys, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Bergsteinsdottir, Kristin; Ogmundsdottir, Margret H.; Steingrimsson, Erikur] Univ Iceland, Biomed Ctr, Fac Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Center, Jacqueline R.; Nguyen, Tuan V.; Eisman, John A.] Garvan Inst Med Res, Sydney, NSW 2010, Australia; [Center, Jacqueline R.; Eisman, John A.] St Vincents Hosp, Sydney, NSW 2010, Australia; [Center, Jacqueline R.; Nguyen, Tuan V.; Eisman, John A.] Univ New S Wales, Sydney, NSW 2010, Australia; [Eisman, John A.] UNDA, Sydney, NSW 2010, Australia; [Christiansen, Claus] CCBR, DK-2750 Ballerup, Denmark; [Jonasson, Jon G.] Natl Univ Hosp Iceland, Landspitali, Dept Pathol, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Jonasson, Jon G.; Tryggvadottir, Laufey; Jonsson, Thorvaldur; Sigurdsson, Gunnar; Thorsteinsdottir, Unnur; Stefansson, Kari] Univ Iceland, Fac Med, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Jonasson, Jon G.; Tryggvadottir, Laufey] Iceland Canc Registry, IS-105 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Eyjolfsson, Gudmundur I.] Iceland Med Ctr Laeknasetrid, Lab Mjodd RAM, IS-109 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Theodors, Asgeir] Natl Univ Hosp Iceland, Landspitali, Dept Gastroenterol, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Jonsson, Thorvaldur] Natl Univ Hosp Iceland, Landspitali, Dept Surg, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Ingvarsson, Thorvaldur] Akureyri Hosp, Dept Orthoped Surg, IS-600 Akureyri, Iceland; [Ingvarsson, Thorvaldur] Univ Akureyri, Inst Hlth Sci, IS-600 Akureyri, Iceland; [Olafsson, Isleifur] Natl Univ Hosp Iceland, Landspitali, Dept Clin Biochem, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Sigurdsson, Gunnar] Natl Univ Hosp Iceland, Landspitali, Dept Endocrinol & Metab, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland","Thorsteinsdottir, U (reprint author), deCODE Genet Amgen, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland.",unnurth@decode.is; kstefans@decode.is,"Eisman, John/C-2886-2014; Helgason, Agnar/K-1522-2015; Walters, G.

Phylogenomic analysis of 1,070 orthologues from 23 yeast genomes identified 1,070 distinct gene trees, which were all incongruent with the phylogeny inferred from concatenation. Incongruence severity increased for shorter internodes located deeper in the phylogeny. Notably, whereas most practices had little or negative impact on the yeast phylogeny, the use of genes or internodes with high average internode support significantly improved the robustness of inference. We obtained similar results in analyses of vertebrate and metazoan phylogenomic data sets. These results question the exclusive reliance on concatenation and associated practices, and argue that selecting genes with strong phylogenetic signals and demonstrating the absence of significant incongruence are essential for accurately reconstructing ancient divergences.","[Salichos, Leonidas; Rokas, Antonis] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Nashville, TN 37235 USA","Rokas, A (reprint author), Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.",antonis.rokas@vanderbilt.edu,"Rokas, Antonis/A-9775-2008","Rokas, Antonis/0000-0002-7248-6551",National Science Foundation [DEB-0844968],We thank K.

The depth of these winds is a crucial unknown in constraining their overall dynamics, energetics and internal structures. There are two approaches to explaining the existence of these strong winds. The first suggests that the jets are driven by shallow atmospheric processes near the surface(1-3), whereas the second suggests that the atmospheric dynamics extend deeply into the planetary interiors(4,5). Here we report that on Uranus and Neptune the depth of the atmospheric dynamics can be revealed by the planets' respective gravity fields. We show that the measured fourth-order gravity harmonic, J(4), constrains the dynamics to the outermost 0.15 per cent of the total mass of Uranus and the outermost 0.2 per cent of the total mass of Neptune. This provides a stronger limit to the depth of the dynamical atmosphere than previously suggested(6), and shows that the dynamics are confined to a thin weather layer no more than about 1,000 kilometres deep on both planets.","[Kaspi, Yohai; Aharonson, Oded] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Environm Sci, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Kaspi, Yohai; Aharonson, Oded] Weizmann Inst Sci, Ctr Planetary Sci, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Showman, Adam P.; Hubbard, William B.] Univ Arizona, Lunar & Planetary Lab, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Aharonson, Oded] CALTECH, Dept Geol & Planetary Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Helled, Ravit] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Geophys & Planetary Sci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel","Kaspi, Y (reprint author), Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Environm Sci, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel.",yohai.kaspi@weizmann.ac.il,,"Helled, Ravit/0000-0001-5555-2652",Helen Kimmel Center for Planetary Science at the Weizmann Institute of Science; NASA,Y.K. and O.A. thank the Helen Kimmel Center for Planetary Science at the Weizmann Institute of Science for support.

In comparison, exciton-polaritons in strongly coupled quantum well microcavities(5) can undergo stimulated scattering that promises more energy-efficient generation of coherent light by 'polariton lasers'(3,6). Polariton laser operation has been demonstrated in optically pumped semiconductor microcavities at temperatures up to room temperature(7-12), and such lasers can outperform their weak-coupling counterparts in that they have a lower threshold density(12,13). Even though polariton diodes have been realized(14-16), electrically pumped polariton laser operation, which is essential for practical applications, has not been achieved until now. Here we present an electrically pumped polariton laser based on a microcavity containing multiple quantum wells. To prove polariton laser emission unambiguously, we apply a magnetic field and probe the hybrid light-matter nature of the polaritons. Our results represent an important step towards the practical implementation of polaritonic light sources and electrically injected condensates, and can be extended to room-temperature operation using wide-bandgap materials.","[Schneider, Christian; Rahimi-Iman, Arash; Fischer, Julian; Amthor, Matthias; Lermer, Matthias; Wolf, Adriana; Worschech, Lukas; Kamp, Martin; Reitzenstein, Stephan; Forchel, Alfred; Hoefling, Sven] Univ Wurzburg, Tech Phys & Wilhelm Conrad Rontgen Res Ctr Comple, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany; [Kim, Na Young; Yamamoto, Yoshihisa] Stanford Univ, EL Ginzton Lab, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kim, Na Young] Univ Tokyo, Inst Ind Sci, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1538505, Japan; [Savenko, Ivan G.; Shelykh, Ivan A.] Univ Iceland, Inst Sci, IS-107 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Savenko, Ivan G.; Shelykh, Ivan A.] Nanyang Technol Univ, Div Phys & Appl Phys, Singapore 637371, Singapore; [Kulakovskii, Vladimir D.] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Solid State Phys, Chernogolovka 142432, Russia; [Reitzenstein, Stephan] Tech Univ Berlin, Inst Festkorperphys, D-10623 Berlin, Germany; [Yamamoto, Yoshihisa] Natl Inst Informat, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1018430, Japan","Hofling, S (reprint author), Univ Wurzburg, Tech Phys & Wilhelm Conrad Rontgen Res Ctr Comple, Hubland, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany.",christian.schneider@physik.uni-wuerzburg.de; sven.hoefling@physik.uni-wuerzburg.de,"; Reitzenstein, Stephan/A-9184-2014; Kamp, Martin/G-9704-2011; Hofling, Sven/C-3140-2013; Yamamoto, Yoshihisa/A-2811-2012","Savenko, Ivan/0000-0002-5515-1127; Kamp, Martin/0000-0002-7219-2297; Hofling, Sven/0000-0003-0034-4682; Forchel, Alfred/0000-0002-9377-9935","State of Bavaria; National Science Foundation; JSPS through its FIRST programme; Eimskip foundation; 'Center of excellence in polaritonics', IRSES SPINMET project; 'Center of excellence in polaritonics', POLAPHEN project; German National Academic Foundation","This work was supported by the State of Bavaria, the National Science Foundation and by JSPS through its FIRST programme.

MOE is also considered a promising route for mitigation of CO2 emissions in steelmaking(3-5), production of metals free of carbon(6), and generation of oxygen for extra-terrestrial exploration(7,8). Until now, MOE has been demonstrated using anode materials that are consumable (graphite for use with ferro-alloys and titanium(6,9)) or unaffordable for terrestrial applications (iridium for use with iron(10,11)). To enable metal production without process carbon, MOE requires an anode material that resists depletion while sustaining oxygen evolution. The challenges for iron production are threefold. First, the process temperature is in excess of 1,538 degrees Celsius (ref. 10). Second, under anodic polarization most metals inevitably corrode in such conditions(11-13). Third, iron oxide undergoes spontaneous reduction on contact with most refractory metals(14) and even carbon. Here we show that anodes comprising chromium-based alloys exhibit limited consumption during iron extraction and oxygen evolution by MOE. The anode stability is due to the formation of an electronically conductive solid solution of chromium(III) and aluminium oxides in the corundum structure. These findings make practicable larger-scale evaluation of MOE for the production of steel, and potentially provide a key material component enabling mitigation of greenhouse-gas emissions while producing metal of superior metallurgical quality.","[Allanore, Antoine; Yin, Lan; Sadoway, Donald R.] MIT, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Allanore, A (reprint author), MIT, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",allanore@mit.edu,"Yin, Lan/G-7513-2014","Allanore, Antoine/0000-0002-2594-0264",American Iron and Steel Institute,The financial support of the American Iron and Steel Institute is acknowledged; we thank H.

Aqueous fluids that have had a similar residence time at mineral interfaces and in fractures (fracture fluids) have not been previously identified. Expulsion of fracture fluids from basement systems with low connectivity occurs through deformation and fracturing of the brittle crust(4). The fractal nature of this process must, at some scale, preserve pockets of interconnected fluid from the earliest crustal history. In one such system, 2.8 kilometres below the surface in a South African gold mine, extant chemoautotrophic microbes have been identified in fluids isolated from the photosphere on timescales of tens of millions of years(5). Deep fracture fluids with similar chemistry have been found in a mine in the Timmins, Ontario, area of the Canadian Precambrian Shield. Here we show that excesses of Xe-124, Xe-126 and Xe-128 in the Timmins mine fluids can be linked to xenon isotope changes in the ancient atmosphere(2) and used to calculate a minimum mean residence time for this fluid of about 1.5 billion years. Further evidence of an ancient fluid system is found in Xe-129 excesses that, owing to the absence of any identifiable mantle input, are probably sourced in sediments and extracted by fluid migration processes operating during or shortly after mineralization at around 2.64 billion years ago. We also provide closed-system radiogenic noble-gas (He-4, Ne-21, Ar-40, Xe-136) residence times. Together, the different noble gases show that ancient pockets of water can survive the crustal fracturing process and remain in the crust for billions of years.","[Holland, G.; Ballentine, C.

There has been a long-lasting debate about the processes that limit adaptation(1-6) and, consequently, about how well adapted phenotypes are. Here we examine how development may affect adaptation, by decomposing the genotype-fitness map-the association between each genotype and its fitness-into two: one mapping genotype to phenotype by means of a computational model of organ development(7), and one mapping phenotype to fitness. In the map of phenotype and fitness, the fitness of each individual is based on the similarity between realized morphology and optimal morphology. We use three different simulations to map phenotype to fitness, and these differ in the way in which similarity is calculated: similarity is calculated for each trait (in terms of each cell position individually), for a large or a small number of phenotypic landmarks (the 'many-traits' and 'few-traits' phenotype-fitness maps), and by measuring the overall surface roughness of morphology (the 'roughness' phenotype-fitness map). Evolution is simulated by applying the genotype-phenotype map and one phenotype-fitness map to each individual in the population, as well as random mutation and drift. We show that the complexity of the genotype-phenotype map prevents substantial adaptation in some of the phenotype-fitness maps: sustained adaptation is only possible using 'roughness' or 'few-traits' phenotype-fitness maps. The results contribute developmental understanding to the long-standing question of which aspects of phenotype can be effectively optimized by natural selection.","[Salazar-Ciudad, Isaac] Univ Helsinki, Inst Biotechnol, Dev Biol Program, Evolutionary Phen Grp, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Salazar-Ciudad, Isaac; Marin-Riera, Miquel] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Genet & Microbiol, Genom Bioinformat & Evolut Grp, Cerdanyola Del Valles 08193, Spain","Salazar-Ciudad, I (reprint author), Univ Helsinki, Inst Biotechnol, Dev Biol Program, Evolutionary Phen Grp, POB 56, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",isaac.salazar@uab.cat,,"Salazar, Isaac/0000-0003-1607-0962",Finnish Academy [WBS 1250271]; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [BFU2010-17044],"We thank J.

Consequently, fisheries should be affected by 'tropicalization' of catch(1-4) (increasing dominance of warm-water species). However, a signature of such climate-change effects on global fisheries catch has so far not been detected. Here we report such an index, the mean temperature of the catch (MTC), that is calculated from the average inferred temperature preference of exploited species weighted by their annual catch. Our results show that, after accounting for the effects of fishing and large-scale oceanographic variability, global MTC increased at a rate of 0.19 degrees Celsius per decade between 1970 and 2006, and non-tropical MTC increased at a rate of 0.23 degrees Celsius per decade. In tropical areas, MTC increased initially because of the reduction in the proportion of subtropical species catches, but subsequently stabilized as scope for further tropicalization of communities became limited. Changes in MTC in 52 large marine ecosystems, covering the majority of the world's coastal and shelf areas, are significantly and positively related to regional changes in sea surface temperature(5). This study shows that ocean warming has already affected global fisheries in the past four decades, highlighting the immediate need to develop adaptation plans to minimize the effect of such warming on the economy and food security of coastal communities, particularly in tropical regions(6,7).","[Cheung, William W.

Continuous production of neuroblasts is controlled by the SVZ microenvironmental niche(3,4). It is generally thought that enhancing the neurogenic activities of endogenous NSCs may provide needed therapeutic options for disease states and after brain injury. However, SVZ NSCs can also differentiate into astrocytes. It remains unclear whether there are conditions that favour astrogenesis over neurogenesis in the SVZ niche, and whether astrocytes produced there have different properties compared with astrocytes produced elsewhere in the brain(5). Here we show in mice that SVZ-generated astrocytes express high levels of thrombospondin 4 (Thbs4)(6,7), a secreted homopentameric glycoprotein, in contrast to cortical astrocytes, which express low levels of Thbs4. We found that localized photothrombotic/ischaemic cortical injury initiates a marked increase in Thbs4(hi) astrocyte production from the postnatal SVZ niche. Tamoxifen-inducible nestin-creER(tm)4 lineage tracing demonstrated that it is these SVZ-generated Thbs4(hi) astrocytes, and not Dcx(+) neuroblasts, that home-in on the injured cortex. This robust post-injury astrogenic response required SVZ Notch activation modulated by Thbs4 via direct Notch1 receptor binding and endocytosis to activate downstream signals, including increased Nfia transcription factor expression important for glia production(8). Consequently, Thbs4 homozygous knockout mice (Thbs4(KO/KO)) showed severe defects in cortical-injury-induced SVZ astrogenesis, instead producing cells expressing Dcx migrating from SVZ to the injury sites. These alterations in cellular responses resulted in abnormal glial scar formation after injury, and significantly increased microvascular haemorrhage into the brain parenchyma of Thbs4(KO/KO) mice. Taken together, these findings have important implications for post-injury applications of endogenous and transplanted NSCs in the therapeutic setting, as well as disease states where Thbs family members have important roles(9,10).","[Benner, Eric J.; Jo, Rebecca; Kuo, Chay T.] Duke Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, George & Jean Brumley Neonatal Perinatal Res Inst, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Luciano, Dominic; Jo, Rebecca; Abdi, Khadar; Paez-Gonzalez, Patricia; Eroglu, Cagla; Kuo, Chay T.] Duke Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Luciano, Dominic; Eroglu, Cagla; Kuo, Chay T.] Duke Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Sheng, Huaxin; Warner, David S.] Duke Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anesthesiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Liu, Chunlei] Duke Univ, Sch Med, Dept Radiol, Brain Imaging & Anal Ctr, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Liu, Chunlei] Duke Univ, Sch Med, Dept Radiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Eroglu, Cagla; Kuo, Chay T.] Duke Univ, Sch Med, Duke Inst Brain Sci, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Kuo, Chay T.] Duke Univ, Sch Med, Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Ctr, Durham, NC 27710 USA","Kuo, CT (reprint author), Duke Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, George & Jean Brumley Neonatal Perinatal Res Inst, Durham, NC 27710 USA.",chay.kuo@duke.edu,"Eroglu, Cagla/P-5315-2014","Eroglu, Cagla/0000-0002-7204-0218; Liu, Chunlei/0000-0001-8816-4832","National Biomedical Technology Resource Center [P41 RR005959, P41 EB015897]; George and Jean Brumley Endowment; Sontag Foundation; David and Lucile Packard Foundation; March of Dimes; NIH [1 DP2 OD004453-01]","We thank D.

Important morphogenetic movements occur throughout embryogenesis, but in particular during gastrulation when a series of dramatic, coordinated cell movements drives the reorganization of a simple ball or sheet of cells into a complex multi-layered organism(1). In Xenopus laevis, the South African clawed frog and also in zebrafish, cell and tissue movements have been studied in explants(2,3), in fixed embryos(4), in vivo using fluorescence microscopy(5,6) or microscopic magnetic resonance imaging(7). None of these methods allows cell behaviours to be observed with micrometre-scale resolution throughout the optically opaque, living embryo over developmental time. Here we use non-invasive in vivo, time-lapse X-ray microtomography, based on single-distance phase contrast and combined with motion analysis, to examine the course of embryonic development. We demonstrate that this powerful four-dimensional imaging technique provides high-resolution views of gastrulation processes in wildtype X. laevis embryos, including vegetal endoderm rotation, archenteron formation, changes in the volumes of cavities within the porous interstitial tissue between archenteron and blastocoel, migration/confrontation of mesendoderm and closure of the blastopore. Differential flow analysis separates collective from relative cell motion to assign propulsion mechanisms. Moreover, digitally determined volume balances confirm that early archenteron inflation occurs through the uptake of external water. A transient ectodermal ridge, formed in association with the confrontation of ventral and head mesendoderm on the blastocoel roof, is identified. When combined with perturbation experiments to investigate molecular and biomechanical underpinnings of morphogenesis, our technique should help to advance our understanding of the fundamentals of development.","[Moosmann, Julian; Ershov, Alexey; Baumbach, Tilo; Hofmann, Ralf] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Photon Sci & Synchrotron Radiat, D-76344 Eggenstein Leopoldshafen, Germany; [Ershov, Alexey] Natl Res Tomsk Polytech Univ, Inst Phys & Technol, Dept Gen Phys, Tomsk 634050, Russia; [Altapova, Venera; Baumbach, Tilo] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Lab Applicat Synchrotron Radiat, D-76128 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Prasad, Maneeshi S.; LaBonne, Carole] Northwestern Univ, Dept Mol Biosci, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Xiao, Xianghui] Argonne Natl Lab, Adv Photon Source, Argonne, IL 60439 USA; [Kashef, Jubin] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Zool 2, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany","Hofmann, R (reprint author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Photon Sci & Synchrotron Radiat, Hermann von Helmholtz Pl 1, D-76344 Eggenstein Leopoldshafen, Germany.",jubin.kashef@kit.edu; ralf.hofmann2@kit.edu,"Moosmann, Julian/D-7075-2013","Moosmann, Julian/0000-0002-6761-7182; Ershov, Alexey/0000-0002-5774-5068","US DOE [DE-AC02-06CH11357]; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology within the framework of the German Excellence Initiative; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [05K12CK2, 05K12VH1]","We would like to acknowledge discussions with J.

Here we report the miRNA expression profiles of 1,302 breast tumours with matching detailed clinical annotation, long-term follow-up and genomic and messenger RNA expression data(7). This provides a comprehensive overview of the quantity, distribution and variation of the miRNA population and provides information on the extent to which genomic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional events contribute to miRNA expression architecture, suggesting an important role for post-transcriptional regulation. The key clinical parameters and cellular pathways related to the miRNA landscape are characterized, revealing context-dependent interactions, for example with regards to cell adhesion and Wnt signalling. Notably, only prognostic miRNA signatures derived from breast tumours devoid of somatic copy-number aberrations (CNA-devoid) are consistently prognostic across several other subtypes and can be validated in external cohorts. We then use a data-driven approach(8) to seek the effects of miRNAs associated with differential co-expression of mRNAs, and find that miRNAs act as modulators of mRNA-mRNA interactions rather than as on-off molecular switches. We demonstrate such an important modulatory role for miRNAs in the biology of CNA-devoid breast cancers, a common subtype in which the immune response is prominent. These findings represent a new framework for studying the biology of miRNAs in human breast cancer.","[Dvinge, Heidi; Git, Anna; Graef, Stefan; Chin, Suet-Feung; Caldas, Carlos] Canc Res UK Cambridge Inst, Cambridge CB2 0RE, England; [Dvinge, Heidi; Git, Anna; Graef, Stefan; Chin, Suet-Feung; Caldas, Carlos] Univ Cambridge, Li Ka Shing Ctr, Dept Oncol, Cambridge CB2 0RE, England; [Salmon-Divon, Mali] European Bioinformat Inst, European Mol Biol Lab, Cambridge CB10 1SD, England; [Salmon-Divon, Mali] Ariel Univ, Ctr Samaria, Dept Mol Biol, IL-40700 Ariel, Israel; [Curtis, Christina; Sottoriva, Andrea] Univ So Calif, Dept Prevent Med, Los Angeles, CA 90033 USA; [Zhao, Yongjun; Hirst, Martin] BC Canc Agcy, Genome Sci Ctr, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada; [Zhao, Yongjun; Hirst, Martin; Turashvili, Gulisa; Aparicio, Sam] Univ British Columbia, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Vancouver, BC V6T 2B5, Canada; [Armisen, Javier; Miska, Eric A.] Univ Cambridge, Wellcome Trust Canc Res UK Gurdon Inst, Cambridge CB2 1QN, England; [Armisen, Javier; Miska, Eric A.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Biochem, Cambridge CB2 1QN, England; [Provenzano, Elena; Caldas, Carlos] Cambridge Univ Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Addenbrookes Hosp, Cambridge Breast Unit, Cambridge CB2 2QQ, England; [Provenzano, Elena; Caldas, Carlos] NIHR Cambridge Biomed Res Ctr, Cambridge CB2 2QQ, England; [Turashvili, Gulisa; Aparicio, Sam] British Columbia Canc Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada; [Green, Andrew; Ellis, Ian] Univ Nottingham, Sch Mol Med Sci, Dept Histopathol, Nottingham NG5 1PB, England; [Caldas, Carlos] Cambridge Expt Canc Med Ctr, Cambridge CB2 0RE, England","Git, A (reprint author), Canc Res UK Cambridge Inst, Robinson Way, Cambridge CB2 0RE, England.",anna.git@cruk.cam.ac.uk; saparicio@bccrc.ca; carlos.caldas@cruk.cam.ac.uk,"Tang, Macy/B-9798-2014; Hirst, Martin/B-7684-2016","Miska, Eric/0000-0002-4450-576X; chin, suet-feung/0000-0001-5697-1082; Curtis, Christina/0000-0003-0166-3802; Dvinge, Heidi/0000-0003-1741-0738",Cancer Research UK; British Columbia Cancer Foundation; University of Cambridge; Hutchinson Whampoa; NIHR Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre; Cambridge Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre,"The study was funded by Cancer Research UK and the British Columbia Cancer Foundation.

Deregulation of miRNAs has been linked to diverse pathological processes, including cancer(2,3). Recent studies have also implicated miRNAs in the regulation of cellular response to a spectrum of stresses(4), such as hypoxia, which is frequently encountered in the poorly angiogenic core of a solid tumour(5). However, the upstream regulators of miRNA biogenesis machineries remain obscure, raising the question of how tumour cells efficiently coordinate and impose specificity on miRNA expression and function in response to stresses. Here we show that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is the product of a well-characterized oncogene in human cancers, suppresses the maturation of specific tumour-suppressor-like miRNAs in response to hypoxic stress through phosphorylation of argonaute 2 (AGO2) at Tyr 393. The association between EGFR and AGO2 is enhanced by hypoxia, leading to elevated AGO2-Y393 phosphorylation, which in turn reduces the binding of Dicer to AGO2 and inhibits miRNA processing from precursor miRNAs to mature miRNAs. We also identify a long-loop structure in precursor miRNAs as a critical regulatory element in phospho-Y393-AGO2-mediated miRNA maturation. Furthermore, AGO2-Y393 phosphorylation mediates EGFR-enhanced cell survival and invasiveness under hypoxia, and correlates with poorer overall survival in breast cancer patients. Our study reveals a previously unrecognized function of EGFR in miRNA maturation and demonstrates how EGFR is likely to function as a regulator of AGO2 through novel post-translational modification. These findings suggest that modulation of miRNA biogenesis is important for stress response in tumour cells and has potential clinical implications.","[Shen, Jia; Xia, Weiya; Khotskaya, Yekaterina B.; Huo, Longfei; Lim, Seung-Oe; Du, Yi; Wang, Yan; Hsu, Jennifer L.; Lam, Yung Carmen; Hung, Mien-Chie] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Mol & Cellular Oncol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Shen, Jia; Du, Yi; Hung, Mien-Chie] Univ Texas Grad Sch Biomed Sci Houston, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Nakanishi, Kotaro; Patel, Dinshaw J.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Struct Biol Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Chang, Wei-Chao; Hsu, Jennifer L.; Hung, Mien-Chie] China Med Univ, Ctr Mol Med, Taichung 402, Taiwan; [Chang, Wei-Chao; Hsu, Jennifer L.; Hung, Mien-Chie] China Med Univ, Grad Inst Canc Biol, Taichung 402, Taiwan; [Chang, Wei-Chao; Chen, Chung-Hsuan] Acad Sinica, Genom Res Ctr, Taipei 105, Taiwan; [Hsu, Jennifer L.; Hung, Mien-Chie] Asia Univ, Taichung 413, Taiwan; [Wu, Yun] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Pathol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [James, Brian P.; Liu, Xiuping; Liu, Chang-Gong] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Expt Therapeut, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Hung, MC (reprint author), Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Mol & Cellular Oncol, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",mhung@mdanderson.org,"Chen, Chung-Hsuan/F-7940-2012",,"US National Institutes of Health [CA109311, CA099031, CA16672]; US National Breast Cancer Foundation; Center for Biological Pathway at the UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, S.

Biofilm-forming bacteria such as the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa are phenotypically distinct from their free-swimming, planktonic counterparts(7-10). Much work has focused on factors affecting surface adhesion, and it is known that P. aeruginosa secretes the Psl exopolysaccharide, which promotes surface attachment by acting as 'molecular glue'(11-15). However, how individual surface-attached bacteria self-organize into microcolonies, the first step in communal biofilm organization, is not well understood. Here we identify a new role for Psl in early biofilm development using a massively parallel cell-tracking algorithm to extract the motility history of every cell on a newly colonized surface(16). By combining this technique with fluorescent Psl staining and computer simulations, we show that P. aeruginosa deposits a trail of Psl as it moves on a surface, which influences the surface motility of subsequent cells that encounter these trails and thus generates positive feedback. Both experiments and simulations indicate that the web of secreted Psl controls the distribution of surface visit frequencies, which can be approximated by a power law. This Pareto-type(17) behaviour indicates that the bacterial community self-organizes in a manner analogous to a capitalist economic system(18), a 'rich-get-richer' mechanism of Psl accumulation that results in a small number of 'elite' cells becoming extremely enriched in communally produced Psl. Using engineered strains with inducible Psl production, we show that local Psl concentrations determine post-division cell fates and that high local Psl concentrations ultimately allow elite cells to serve as the founding population for initial microcolony development.","[Zhao, Kun; Gibiansky, Maxsim L.; Wong, Gerard C.

Highly pathogenic avian H5N1 viruses that are a threat to public health have been observed to acquire affinity for human receptors, and transmissible-mutant-selection experiments have identified a virus that is transmissible in ferrets(1-3), the generally accepted experimental model for influenza in humans. Here, our quantitative biophysical measurements of the receptor-binding properties of haemagglutinin (HA) from the transmissible mutant indicate a small increase in affinity for human receptor and a marked decrease in affinity for avian receptor. From analysis of virus and HA binding data we have derived an algorithm that predicts virus avidity from the affinity of individual HA-receptor interactions. It reveals that the transmissible-mutant virus has a 200-fold preference for binding human over avian receptors. The crystal structure of the transmissible-mutant HA in complex with receptor analogues shows that it has acquired the ability to bind human receptor in the same folded-back conformation as seen for HA from the 1918, 1957 (ref. 4), 1968 (ref. 5) and 2009 (ref. 6) pandemic viruses. This binding mode is substantially different from that by which non-transmissible wild-type H5 virus HA binds human receptor. The structure of the complex also explains how the change in preference from avian to human receptors arises from the Gln226Leu substitution, which facilitates binding to human receptor but restricts binding to avian receptor. Both features probably contribute to the acquisition of transmissibility by this mutant virus.","[Xiong, Xiaoli; Coombs, Peter J.; Martin, Stephen R.; Xiao, Haixia; McCauley, John W.; Walker, Philip A.; Collins, Patrick J.; Skehel, John J.; Gamblin, Steven J.] Natl Inst Med Res, MRC, London NW7 1AA, England; [Liu, Junfeng] China Agr Univ, Minist Agr, Key Lab Plant Pathol, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Locher, Kathrin] Novartis Inst BioMed Res, CH-4057 Basel, Switzerland; [Kawaoka, Yoshihiro] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Pathobiol Sci, Madison, WI 53711 USA","Gamblin, SJ (reprint author), Natl Inst Med Res, MRC, Mill Hill, London NW7 1AA, England.",skeheljj@nimr.mrc.ac.uk; sgambli@nimr.mrc.ac.uk,,"Gamblin, Steven/0000-0001-5331-639X","BBSRC [BB/E010806]; Medical Research Council [U117584222, U117512723, U117570592]","We are grateful to staff at the Diamond Light Source Synchrotron for assistance and beamline access under proposal 7707, E.

This contrasts with the more prevalent rugby-ball shape of nuclei with reflection-symmetric, quadrupole deformations. The elusive octupole deformed nuclei are of importance for nuclear structure theory, and also in searches for physics beyond the standard model; any measurable electric-dipole moment (a signature of the latter) is expected to be amplified in such nuclei. Here we determine electric octupole transition strengths (a direct measure of octupole correlations) for short-lived isotopes of radon and radium. Coulomb excitation experiments were performed using accelerated beams of heavy, radioactive ions. Our data on Rn-220 and Ra-224 show clear evidence for stronger octupole deformation in the latter. The results enable discrimination between differing theoretical approaches to octupole correlations, and help to constrain suitable candidates for experimental studies of atomic electric-dipole moments that might reveal extensions to the standard model.","[Gaffney, L.

Yet the neural mechanisms that generate and coordinate these and other orofacial motor patterns remain largely uncharacterized. Here we use anatomical, behavioural, electrophysiological and pharmacological tools to show that whisking and sniffing are coordinated by respiratory centres in the ventral medulla. We delineate a distinct region in the ventral medulla that provides rhythmic input to the facial motor neurons that drive protraction of the vibrissae. Neuronal output from this region is reset at each inspiration by direct input from the pre-Botzinger complex, such that high-frequency sniffing has a one-to-one relationship with whisking, whereas basal respiration is accompanied by intervening whisks that occur between breaths. We conjecture that the respiratory nuclei, which project to other premotor regions for oral and facial control, function as a master clock for behaviours that coordinate with breathing.","[Moore, Jeffrey D.; Kleinfeld, David] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Phys, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Deschenes, Martin; Demers, Maxime] Ctr Rech Univ Laval Robert Giffard, Dept Psychiat & Neurosci, Quebec City, PQ G1J 2G3, Canada; [Furuta, Takahiro] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Morphol Brain Sci, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Huber, Daniel; Smear, Matthew C.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA; [Kleinfeld, David] Univ Calif San Diego, Neurobiol Sect, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Deschenes, M (reprint author), Ctr Rech Univ Laval Robert Giffard, Dept Psychiat & Neurosci, 2601 Canardiere, Quebec City, PQ G1J 2G3, Canada.",martin.deschenes@crulrg.ulaval.ca; dk@physics.ucsd.edu,"Huber, Daniel/C-2932-2013",,"Canadian Institutes of Health Research [MT-5877]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (KAKENHI) [23135519, 24500409]; National Institutes of Health [NS058668, NS066664, NS047101]; US-Israeli Binational Science Foundation [2003222]","We thank A.

Here we show that the hypothalamus is important for the development of whole-body ageing in mice, and that the underlying basis involves hypothalamic immunity mediated by I kappa B kinase-beta (IKK-beta), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) and related microglianeuron immune crosstalk. Several interventional models were developed showing that ageing retardation and lifespan extension are achieved in mice by preventing ageing-related hypothalamic or brain IKK-beta and NF-kappa B activation. Mechanistic studies further revealed that IKK-beta and NF-kappa B inhibit gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) to mediate ageing-related hypothalamic GnRH decline, and GnRH treatment amends ageing-impaired neurogenesis and decelerates ageing. In conclusion, the hypothalamus has a programmatic role in ageing development via immune-neuroendocrine integration, and immune inhibition or GnRH restoration in the hypothalamus/brain represent two potential strategies for optimizing lifespan and combating ageing-related health problems.","[Zhang, Guo; Li, Juxue; Purkayastha, Sudarshana; Tang, Yizhe; Zhang, Hai; Yin, Ye; Li, Bo; Liu, Gang; Cai, Dongsheng] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Mol Pharmacol, Bronx, NY 10461 USA; [Zhang, Guo; Li, Juxue; Purkayastha, Sudarshana; Tang, Yizhe; Zhang, Hai; Yin, Ye; Li, Bo; Liu, Gang; Cai, Dongsheng] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Diabet Res Ctr, Bronx, NY 10461 USA; [Zhang, Guo; Li, Juxue; Purkayastha, Sudarshana; Tang, Yizhe; Zhang, Hai; Yin, Ye; Li, Bo; Liu, Gang; Cai, Dongsheng] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Inst Aging, Bronx, NY 10461 USA","Cai, DS (reprint author), Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Mol Pharmacol, Bronx, NY 10461 USA.",dongsheng.cai@einstein.yu.edu,"Tang, Yizhe/A-8682-2014; Zhang, Guo/Q-8513-2016","Zhang, Guo/0000-0002-3880-6996","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R01 AG031774, R01 DK078750]; American Diabetes Association [1-12-BS-20]; Irma T.

Here we report co-crystal structures of a complex of truncated mTOR and mammalian lethal with SEC13 protein 8 (mLST8) with an ATP transition state mimic and with ATP-site inhibitors. The structures reveal an intrinsically active kinase conformation, with catalytic residues and a catalytic mechanism remarkably similar to canonical protein kinases. The active site is highly recessed owing to the FKBP12-rapamycin-binding (FRB) domain and an inhibitory helix protruding from the catalytic cleft. mTOR-activating mutations map to the structural framework that holds these elements in place, indicating that the kinase is controlled by restricted access. In vitro biochemistry shows that the FRB domain acts as a gatekeeper, with its rapamycin-binding site interacting with substrates to grant them access to the restricted active site. Rapamycin-FKBP12 inhibits the kinase by directly blocking substrate recruitment and by further restricting active-site access.

This feature has been interpreted to be the neutral component of a condensing intergalactic filament(4), which would be able to fuel star formation in M31 and M33, but simulations suggest that such a feature could also result from an interaction between both galaxies within the past few billion years (ref. 5). Here we report radio observations showing that about 50 per cent of this gas is composed of clouds, with the rest distributed in an extended, diffuse component. The clouds have velocities comparable to those of M31 and M33, and have properties suggesting that they are unrelated to other Local Group objects.

All such experimental violations require additional assumptions depending on their specific construction, making them vulnerable to so-called loopholes. Here we use entangled photons to violate a Bell inequality while closing the fair-sampling loophole, that is, without assuming that the sample of measured photons accurately represents the entire ensemble(3). To do this, we use the Eberhard form of Bell's inequality, which is not vulnerable to the fair-sampling assumption and which allows a lower collection efficiency than other forms(4). Technical improvements of the photon source(5,6) and high-efficiency transition-edge sensors(7) were crucial for achieving a sufficiently high collection efficiency.

A different class of ordering phenomena of great interest concerns spin configurations that are topologically protected, that is, their topology can be destroyed only by forcing the average magnetization locally to zero(1). Examples of such configurations are hedgehogs (points at which all spins are either pointing inwards or outwards) and vortices. A central question concerns the nature of the metallic state in the presence of such topologically distinct spin textures. Here we report a high-pressure study of the metallic state at the border of the skyrmion lattice in MnSi, which represents a new form of magnetic order composed of topologically non-trivial vortices(2). When long-range magnetic order is suppressed under pressure, the key characteristic of the skyrmion lattice-that is, the topological Hall signal due to the emergent magnetic flux associated with the topological winding-is unaffected in sign or magnitude and becomes an important characteristic of the metallic state. The regime of the topological Hall signal in temperature, pressure and magnetic field coincides thereby with the exceptionally extended regime of a pronounced non-Fermi-liquid resistivity(3,30). The observation of this topological Hall signal in the regime of the NFL resistivity suggests empirically that spin correlations with non-trivial topological character may drive a breakdown of Fermi liquid theory in pure metals.","[Ritz, R.; Halder, M.; Wagner, M.; Franz, C.; Bauer, A.; Pfleiderer, C.] Tech Univ Munich, Phys Dept E21, D-85748 Garching, Germany","Ritz, R (reprint author), Tech Univ Munich, Phys Dept E21, D-85748 Garching, Germany.",robert.ritz@frm2.tum.de; christian.pfleiderer@frm2.tum.de,"Pfleiderer, Christian/P-3575-2014","Bauer, Andreas/0000-0002-1070-9748; Halder, Marco/0000-0002-9807-5400","TUM Graduate School; DFG [TRR80, FOR960]; ERC-AdG [291079 TOPFIT]","We wish to thank P.

The latter is controlled by the acceleration of ice flow and subsequent thinning of fast-flowing marine-terminating outlet glaciers(3). Quantifying the future dynamic contribution of such glaciers to sea-level rise (SLR) remains a major challenge because outlet glacier dynamics are poorly understood(4). Here we present a glacier flow model that includes a fully dynamic treatment of marine termini. We use this model to simulate behaviour of four major marine-terminating outlet glaciers, which collectively drain about 22 per cent of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Using atmospheric and oceanic forcing from a mid-range future warming scenario that predicts warming by 2.8 degrees Celsius by 2100, we project a contribution of 19 to 30 millimetres to SLR from these glaciers by 2200. This contribution is largely (80 per cent) dynamic in origin and is caused by several episodic retreats past overdeepenings in outlet glacier troughs. After initial increases, however, dynamic losses from these four outlets remain relatively constant and contribute to SLR individually at rates of about 0.01 to 0.06 millimetres per year.

Haematopoietic cytokines are known to increase output of specific mature cells by affecting survival, expansion and differentiation of lineage-committed progenitors(1,2), but it has been debated whether long-term haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are susceptible to direct lineage-specifying effects of cytokines. Although genetic changes in transcription factor balance can sensitize HSCs to cytokine instruction(3), the initiation of HSC commitment is generally thought to be triggered by stochastic fluctuation in cell-intrinsic regulators such as lineage-specific transcription factors(4-7), leaving cytokines to ensure survival and proliferation of the progeny cells(8,9). Here we show that macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF, also called CSF1), a myeloid cytokine released during infection and inflammation, can directly induce the myeloid master regulator PU.1 and instruct myeloid cell-fate change in mouse HSCs, independently of selective survival or proliferation. Video imaging and single-cell gene expression analysis revealed that stimulation of highly purified HSCs with M-CSF in culture resulted in activation of the PU.1 promoter and an increased number of PU.1(+) cells with myeloid gene signature and differentiation potential. In vivo, high systemic levels of M-CSF directly stimulated M-CSF-receptor-dependent activation of endogenous PU.1 protein in single HSCs and induced a PU.1-dependent myeloid differentiation preference. Our data demonstrate that lineage-specific cytokines can act directly on HSCs in vitro and in vivo to instruct a change of cell identity. This fundamentally changes the current view of how HSCs respond to environmental challenge and implicates stress-induced cytokines as direct instructors of HSC fate.","[Mossadegh-Keller, Noushine; Sarrazin, Sandrine; Kandalla, Prashanth K.; Sieweke, Michael H.] Aix Marseille Univ, Ctr Immunol Marseille Luminy, UM2, F-13288 Marseille 09, France; [Mossadegh-Keller, Noushine; Sarrazin, Sandrine; Kandalla, Prashanth K.; Sieweke, Michael H.] INSERM, U1104, F-13288 Marseille 09, France; [Mossadegh-Keller, Noushine; Sarrazin, Sandrine; Kandalla, Prashanth K.; Sieweke, Michael H.] CNRS, UMR7280, F-13288 Marseille 09, France; [Espinosa, Leon] CNRS, Chim Bacterienne Lab, UMR 7283, F-13009 Marseille, France; [Stanley, E.

However, this regenerative capacity is lost by postnatal day 7 and the mechanisms of cardiomyocyte cell cycle arrest remain unclear. The homeodomain transcription factor Meis1 is required for normal cardiac development but its role in cardiomyocytes is unknown(3,4). Here we identify Meis1 as a critical regulator of the cardiomyocyte cell cycle. Meis1 deletion in mouse cardiomyocytes was sufficient for extension of the postnatal proliferative window of cardiomyocytes, and for re-activation of cardiomyocyte mitosis in the adult heart with no deleterious effect on cardiac function. In contrast, overexpression of Meis1 in cardiomyocytes decreased neonatal myocyte proliferation and inhibited neonatal heart regeneration. Finally, we show that Meis1 is required for transcriptional activation of the synergistic CDK inhibitors p15, p16 and p21. These results identify Meis1 as a critical transcriptional regulator of cardiomyocyte proliferation and a potential therapeutic target for heart regeneration.","[Mahmoud, Ahmed I.; Kocabas, Fatih; Muralidhar, Shalini A.; Kimura, Wataru; Thet, Suwannee; Sadek, Hesham A.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Internal Med, Div Cardiol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Koura, Ahmed S.] Ain Shams Univ, Sch Med, Cairo 1156, Egypt; [Porrello, Enzo R.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biomed Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia","Sadek, HA (reprint author), Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Internal Med, Div Cardiol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA.",hesham.sadek@utsouthwestern.edu,"Kocabas, Fatih/B-2975-2012","Kocabas, Fatih/0000-0001-8096-6056; Kocabas, Fatih/0000-0002-2854-9180","American Heart Association; Gilead Research Scholars Program in Cardiovascular Disease; Foundation for Heart Failure Research, NY; National Institutes of Health [1R01HL115275-01]","We thank J.

These systems use an array of small CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) consisting of repetitive sequences flanking unique spacers to recognize their targets, and conserved Cas proteins to mediate target degradation(5-8). Recent studies have suggested that these systems may have broader functions in bacterial physiology, and it is unknown if they regulate expression of endogenous genes(9,10). Here we demonstrate that the Cas protein Cas9 of Francisella novicida uses a unique, small, CRISPR/Cas-associated RNA (scaRNA) to repress an endogenous transcript encoding a bacterial lipoprotein. As bacterial lipoproteins trigger a proinflammatory innate immune response aimed at combating pathogens(11,12), CRISPR/Cas-mediated repression of bacterial lipoprotein expression is critical for F. novicida to dampen this host response and promote virulence. Because Cas9 proteins are highly enriched in pathogenic and commensal bacteria, our work indicates that CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene regulation may broadly contribute to the regulation of endogenous bacterial genes, particularly during the interaction of such bacteria with eukaryotic hosts.","[Sampson, Timothy R.; Llewellyn, Anna C.] Emory Univ, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Microbiol & Mol Genet Program, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA; [Sampson, Timothy R.; Llewellyn, Anna C.; Weiss, David S.] Emory Univ, Emory Vaccine Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA; [Sampson, Timothy R.; Llewellyn, Anna C.; Weiss, David S.] Emory Univ, Yerkes Natl Primate Res Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA; [Saroj, Sunil D.; Tzeng, Yih-Ling; Weiss, David S.] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Infect Dis, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA","Weiss, DS (reprint author), Emory Univ, Emory Vaccine Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA.",david.weiss@emory.edu,"Sampson, Tim/B-9061-2013","Sampson, Timothy/0000-0002-2486-8766",National Institutes of Health (NIH) from the Southeastern Regional Center of Excellence for Emerging Infections and Biodefense [U54-AI057157]; NSF Graduate Research Fellowship; ARCS Foundation;  [R56-AI87673];  [R56-AI061031],"We would like to thank R.

Previous studies suggested that the T-cell receptor repertoires of thymic T-reg cells and induced T-reg cells are biased towards self and non-self antigens, respectively(3-6), but their relative contribution in controlling immunopathology, such as colitis and other untoward inflammatory responses triggered by different types of antigens, remains unresolved(7). The intestine, and especially the colon, is a particularly suitable organ to study this question, given the variety of self-, microbiota- and food-derived antigens to which T-reg cells and other T-cell populations are exposed. Intestinal environments can enhance conversion to a regulatory lineage(8,9) and favour tolerogenic presentation of antigens to naive CD4(+) T cells(10,11), suggesting that intestinal homeostasis depends on microbiota-specific induced T-reg cells(12-15). Here, to identify the origin and antigen-specificity of intestinal T-reg cells, we performed single-cell and high-throughput sequencing of the T-cell receptor repertoires of CD4(+) Foxp3(+) and CD4(+) Foxp3(-) T cells, and analysed their reactivity against specific commensal species. We show that thymus-derived T-reg cells constitute most T-reg cells in all lymphoid and intestinal organs, including the colon, where their repertoire is heavily influenced by the composition of the microbiota. Our results suggest that thymic T-reg cells, and not induced T-reg cells, dominantly mediate tolerance to antigens produced by intestinal commensals.","[Cebula, Anna; Pabla, Simarjot Singh; McIndoe, Richard A.; Kraj, Piotr; Ignatowicz, Leszek] Georgia Regents Univ, Ctr Biotechnol & Genom Med, Augusta, GA 30912 USA; [Seweryn, Michal; Rempala, Grzegorz A.] Ohio State Univ, Coll Publ Hlth, Math Biosci Inst, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Seweryn, Michal] Univ Lodz, Fac Math & Comp Sci, PL-90238 Lodz, Poland; [Denning, Timothy L.] Emory Univ, Dept Pediat, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA; [Bry, Lynn] Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Kisielow, Pawel] Ludwik Hirszfeld Inst Immunol & Expt Therapy, Dept Tumor Immunol, PL-53114 Wroclaw, Poland","Ignatowicz, L (reprint author), Georgia Regents Univ, Ctr Biotechnol & Genom Med, Augusta, GA 30912 USA.",lignatowicz@gru.edu,,"Denning, Tim/0000-0002-1072-7444","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [AI 5R01AI079277, DMS1106485, R01CA152158]; Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts;  [P30-DK034854]","This work was supported by basic research grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH; AI 5R01AI079277 to L.

Although conserved transcription factors and signalling proteins involved in myogenesis have been identified, upstream regulators are less well understood. Here we report an unexpected discovery that the membrane protein BAI1, previously linked to recognition of apoptotic cells by phagocytes(3), promotes myoblast fusion. Endogenous BAI1 expression increased during myoblast fusion, and BAI1 overexpression enhanced myoblast fusion by means of signalling through ELMO/Dock180/Rac1 proteins(4). During myoblast fusion, a fraction of myoblasts within the population underwent apoptosis and exposed phosphatidylserine, an established ligand for BAI1 (ref. 3). Blocking apoptosis potently impaired myoblast fusion, and adding back apoptotic myoblasts restored fusion. Furthermore, primary human myoblasts could be induced to form myotubes by adding apoptotic myoblasts, even under normal growth conditions. Mechanistically, apoptotic cells did not directly fuse with the healthy myoblasts, rather the apoptotic cells induced a contact-dependent signalling with neighbours to promote fusion among the healthy myoblasts. In vivo, myofibres from Bai1(-/-) mice are smaller than those from wild-type littermates. Muscle regeneration after injury was also impaired in Bai1(-/-) mice, highlighting a role for BAI1 in mammalian myogenesis. Collectively, these data identify apoptotic cells as a new type of cue that induces signalling via the phosphatidylserine receptor BAI1 to promote fusion of healthy myoblasts, with important implications for muscle development and repair.","[Hochreiter-Hufford, Amelia E.; Lee, Chang Sup; Kinchen, Jason M.; Arandjelovic, Sanja; Ravichandran, Kodi S.] Univ Virginia, Dept Microbiol Immunol & Canc Biol, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Hochreiter-Hufford, Amelia E.; Lee, Chang Sup; Kinchen, Jason M.; Arandjelovic, Sanja; Ravichandran, Kodi S.] Univ Virginia, Beirne B Carter Immunol Ctr, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Hochreiter-Hufford, Amelia E.; Lee, Chang Sup; Kinchen, Jason M.; Sokolowski, Jennifer D.; Arandjelovic, Sanja; Mandell, James W.; Ravichandran, Kodi S.] Univ Virginia, Ctr Cell Clearance, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Sokolowski, Jennifer D.; Mandell, James W.] Univ Virginia, Dept Pathol, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Call, Jarrod A.; Klibanov, Alexander L.; Yan, Zhen] Univ Virginia, Robert M Berne Cardiovasc Res Ctr, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Call, Jarrod A.; Klibanov, Alexander L.; Yan, Zhen] Univ Virginia, Dept Med, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA","Ravichandran, KS (reprint author), Univ Virginia, Dept Microbiol Immunol & Canc Biol, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA.",Ravi@virginia.edu,,"Call, Jarrod/0000-0002-1094-4940",National Institute of General Medical Sciences/National Institutes of Health; Center for Cell Clearance at the University of Virginia,"We thank members of the Ravichandran laboratory for their valuable suggestions at many stages of this work.

Energy-coupling factor (ECF) transporters belong to a new class of ATP-binding cassette importers. Each ECF transporter comprises an energy-coupling module consisting of a transmembrane T protein (EcfT), two nucleotide-binding proteins (EcfA and EcfA'), and another transmembrane substrate-specific binding S protein(12-14) (EcfS). Despite the similarities with ABC transporters, ECF transporters have different organizational and functional properties. The lack of solute-binding proteins in ECF transporters differentiates them clearly from the canonical ABC importers(15). Previously reported structures of the EcfS proteins RibU and ThiT clearly demonstrated the binding site of substrate riboflavin and thiamine, respectively(16,17). However, the organization of the four different components and the transport mechanism of ECF transporters remain unknown. Here we present the structure of an intact folate ECF transporter from Lactobacillus brevis at a resolution of 3 angstrom. This structure was captured in an inward-facing, nucleotide-free conformation with no bound substrate. The folate-binding protein FolT is nearly parallel to the membrane and is bound almost entirely by EcfT, which adopts an L shape and connects to EcfA and EcfA' through two coupling helices. Two conserved XRX motifs from the coupling helices of EcfT have a vital role in energy coupling by docking into EcfA-EcfA'. We propose a transport model that involves a substantial conformational change of FolT.","[Xu, Ke; Zhang, Minhua; Zhao, Qin; Guo, Hui; Wang, Chengyuan; He, Fangyuan; Zhang, Peng] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Biol Sci, Inst Plant Physiol & Ecol, Natl Key Lab Plant Mol Genet, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China; [Yu, Fang; Ding, Jianping] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Biol Sci, Inst Biochem & Cell Biol, State Key Lab Mol Biol, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Peng] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Biol Sci, Inst Plant Physiol & Ecol, CAS Key Lab Synthet Biol, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China","Zhang, P (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Biol Sci, Inst Plant Physiol & Ecol, Natl Key Lab Plant Mol Genet, 300 Fenglin Rd, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China.",pengzhang01@sibs.ac.cn,,"_, __/0000-0001-7029-7346","Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2013CB127000]; Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences [2012OHTP, 2009CSP001, 2011KIP101, KSCX2-EW-J-12]; Shanghai 'Pujiang Talent' programme [11PJ1411300]","We thank X.

Each ECF transporter comprises a pair of cytosolic ATPases (the A and A' components, or EcfA and EcfA'), a membrane-embedded substrate-binding protein (the S component, or EcfS) and a transmembrane energy-coupling component (the T component, or EcfT) that links the EcfA-EcfA' subcomplex to EcfS. The structure and transport mechanism of the quaternary ECF transporter remain largely unknown. Here we report the crystal structure of a nucleotide-free ECF transporter from Lactobacillus brevis at a resolution of 3.5 angstrom. The T component has a horseshoe-shaped open architecture, with five alpha-helices as transmembrane segments and two cytoplasmic alpha-helices as coupling modules connecting to the A and A' components. Strikingly, the S component, thought to be specific for hydroxymethyl pyrimidine, lies horizontally along the lipid membrane and is bound exclusively by the five transmembrane segments and the two cytoplasmic helices of the T component. These structural features suggest a plausible working model for the transport cycle of the ECF transporters.","[Wang, Tingliang; Fu, Guobin; Pan, Xiaojing; Wu, Jianping; Gong, Xinqi; Shi, Yigong] Tsinghua Univ, Minist Educ Key Lab Prot Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Wang, Tingliang; Fu, Guobin; Pan, Xiaojing; Wu, Jianping; Gong, Xinqi; Shi, Yigong] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Life Sci, Struct Biol Ctr, Tsinghua Peking Joint Ctr Life Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Wang, Tingliang; Fu, Guobin; Pan, Xiaojing; Wu, Jianping; Gong, Xinqi; Shi, Yigong] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Med, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jiawei] Tsinghua Univ, State Key Lab Biomembrane & Membrane Biotechnol, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China","Shi, YG (reprint author), Tsinghua Univ, Minist Educ Key Lab Prot Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",shi-lab@tsinghua.edu.cn,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology (973 Programs) [2009CB918801, 2013CB910602]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31021002, 31130002]",We thank S.

Most endometrioid tumours had few copy number alterations or TP53 mutations, but frequent mutations in PTEN, CTNNB1, PIK3CA, ARID1A and KRAS and novel mutations in the SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex gene ARID5B. A subset of endometrioid tumours that we identified had a markedly increased transversion mutation frequency and newly identified hotspot mutations in POLE. Our results classified endometrial cancers into four categories: POLE ultramutated, microsatellite instability hypermutated, copy-number low, and copy-number high. Uterine serous carcinomas share genomic features with ovarian serous and basal-like breast carcinomas. We demonstrated that the genomic features of endometrial carcinomas permit a reclassification that may affect post-surgical adjuvant treatment for women with aggressive tumours.","[Getz, Gad; Gabriel, Stacey B.; Cibulskis, Kristian; Lander, Eric; Sivachenko, Andrey; Sougnez, Carrie; Lawrence, Mike; Pashtan, Itai; Saksena, Gordon; Onofrio, Robert C.; Schumacher, Steven E.; Tabak, Barbara; Carter, Scott L.; Hernandez, Bryan; Gentry, Jeff; Salvesen, Helga B.; Ardlie, Kristin; Winckler, Wendy; Beroukhim, Rameen; Meyerson, Matthew; Chin, Lynda; Cho, Juok; DiCara, Daniel; Frazer, Scott; Heiman, David; Jing, Rui; Lin, Pei; Mallard, Will; Stojanov, Petar; Voet, Doug; Zhang, Hailei; Zou, Lihua; Noble, Michael; Cherniack, Andrew D.] MIT, Eli & Edythe L Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Kandoth, Cyriac; Dooling, David; Fulton, Robert; Fulton, Lucinda; Kalicki-Veizer, Joelle; McLellan, Michael D.; O'Laughlin, Michelle; Schmidt, Heather; Wilson, Richard K.; Ye, Kai; Ding, Li; Mardis, Elaine R.] Washington Univ, Genome Inst, St Louis, MO 63108 USA; [Mardis, Elaine R.; Ally, Adrian; Balasundaram, Miruna; Birol, Inanc; Butterfield, Yaron S.

Hippocampal place cells have been proposed to have a role in navigational planning, but direct evidence has been lacking. Here we show that before goal-directed navigation in an open arena, the rat hippocampus generates brief sequences encoding spatial trajectories strongly biased to progress from the subject's current location to a known goal location. These sequences predict immediate future behaviour, even in cases in which the specific combination of start and goal locations is novel. These results indicate that hippocampal sequence events characterized previously in linearly constrained environments as 'replay' are also capable of supporting a goal-directed, trajectory-finding mechanism, which identifies important places and relevant behavioural paths, at specific times when memory retrieval is required, and in a manner that could be used to control subsequent navigational behaviour.","[Pfeiffer, Brad E.; Foster, David J.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Solomon H Snyder Dept Neurosci, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Foster, DJ (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Solomon H Snyder Dept Neurosci, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",david.foster@jhu.edu,,,Alfred P.

The outcomes of independent measurements on entangled objects show correlations that cannot be explained by classical physics. As well as being of fundamental interest, entanglement is a unique resource for quantum information processing and communication. Entangled quantum bits (qubits) can be used to share private information or implement quantum logical gates(1,2). Such capabilities are particularly useful when the entangled qubits are spatially separated(3-5), providing the opportunity to create highly connected quantum networks(6) or extend quantum cryptography to long distances(7,8). Here we report entanglement of two electron spin qubits in diamond with a spatial separation of three metres. We establish this entanglement using a robust protocol based on creation of spin-photon entanglement at each location and a subsequent joint measurement of the photons. Detection of the photons heralds the projection of the spin qubits onto an entangled state. We verify the resulting non-local quantum correlations by performing single-shot readout(9) on the qubits in different bases. The long-distance entanglement reported here can be combined with recently achieved initialization, readout and entanglement operations(9-13) on local long-lived nuclear spin registers, paving the way for deterministic long-distance teleportation, quantum repeaters and extended quantum networks.","[Bernien, H.; Hensen, B.; Pfaff, W.; Koolstra, G.; Blok, M.

A spin readout fidelity of about 90 per cent has been demonstrated with both electrical read-out(1) and optical read-out(10,11); however, the thermal limitations of the former and the poor photon collection efficiency of the latter make it difficult to achieve the higher fidelities required for quantum information applications. Here we demonstrate a hybrid approach in which optical excitation is used to change the charge state (conditional on its spin state) of an erbium defect centre in a silicon-based single-electron transistor, and this change is then detected electrically. The high spectral resolution of the optical frequency-addressing step overcomes the thermal broadening limitation of the previous electrical read-out scheme, and the charge-sensing step avoids the difficulties of efficient photon collection. This approach could lead to new architectures for quantum information processing devices and could drastically increase the range of defect centres that can be exploited. Furthermore, the efficient electrical detection of the optical excitation of single sites in silicon represents a significant step towards developing interconnects between optical-based quantum computing and silicon technologies.","[Yin, Chunming; de Boo, Gabriele G.; Rogge, Sven] Univ New S Wales, Sch Phys, Ctr Excellence Quantum Computat & Commun Technol, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Rancic, Milos; Sellars, Matthew J.] Australian Natl Univ, RSPE, Ctr Excellence Quantum Computat & Commun Technol, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Stavrias, Nikolas; McCallum, Jeffrey C.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Phys, Ctr Excellence Quantum Computat & Commun Technol, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia","Rogge, S (reprint author), Univ New S Wales, Sch Phys, Ctr Excellence Quantum Computat & Commun Technol, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",s.rogge@unsw.edu.au,"Yin, Chunming/F-5763-2011; Sellars, Matthew/J-3130-2014; Rogge, Sven/G-3709-2010","Yin, Chunming/0000-0003-0117-8225; Sellars, Matthew/0000-0002-0502-0444; Rancic, Milos/0000-0002-8672-6771","ARC Centre of Excellence for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology [CE110001027]; Future Fellowships [FT100100589, FT110100919]","We thank R.

A challenge in building digital cameras with the hemispherical, compound apposition layouts of arthropod eyes is that essential design requirements cannot be met with existing planar sensor technologies or conventional optics. Here we present materials, mechanics and integration schemes that afford scalable pathways to working, arthropod-inspired cameras with nearly full hemispherical shapes (about 160 degrees). Their surfaces are densely populated by imaging elements (artificial ommatidia), which are comparable in number (180) to those of the eyes of fire ants (Solenopsis fugax) and bark beetles(4,5) (Hylastes nigrinus). The devices combine elastomeric compound optical elements with deformable arrays of thin silicon photodetectors into integrated sheets that can be elastically transformed from the planar geometries in which they are fabricated to hemispherical shapes for integration into apposition cameras. Our imaging results and quantitative ray-tracing-based simulations illustrate key features of operation. These general strategies seem to be applicable to other compound eye devices, such as those inspired by moths and lacewings(6,7) (refracting superposition eyes), lobster and shrimp(8) (reflecting superposition eyes), and houseflies(9) (neural superposition eyes).","[Song, Young Min; Xie, Yizhu; Malyarchuk, Viktor; Kim, Rak-Hwan; Rogers, John A.] Univ Illinois, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Beckman Inst Adv Sci & Technol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Song, Young Min; Xie, Yizhu; Malyarchuk, Viktor; Kim, Rak-Hwan; Rogers, John A.] Univ Illinois, Frederick Seitz Mat Res Lab, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Xiao, Jianliang] Univ Colorado, Dept Mech Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Jung, Inhwa] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Yongin 446701, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Choi, Ki-Joong; Rogers, John A.] Univ Illinois, Dept Chem, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Liu, Zhuangjian] ASTAR, Inst High Performance Comp, Singapore 138632, Singapore; [Park, Hyunsung; Crozier, Kenneth B.] Harvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Lu, Chaofeng] Zhejiang Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Lu, Chaofeng] Zhejiang Univ, Soft Matter Res Ctr, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Lu, Chaofeng; Li, Rui; Huang, Yonggang] Northwestern Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Dept Mech Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Li, Rui] Dalian Univ Technol, Dept Engn Mech, State Key Lab Struct Anal Ind Equipment, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China","Rogers, JA (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Beckman Inst Adv Sci & Technol, 1304 W Green St, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",jrogers@illinois.edu,"Xiao, Jianliang/B-4535-2008; Song, Young Min/B-2215-2010; Li, Rui/C-2155-2009; Kim, Rak-Hwan/A-6155-2012; Rogers, John /L-2798-2016; Huang, Yonggang/B-6998-2009","Song, Young Min/0000-0002-4473-6883; CROZIER, KENNETH/0000-0003-0947-001X; ",Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Nanoelectromechanical /Microelectromechanical Science & Technology (N/MEMS S&T) Fundamentals programme by the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Pacific (SPAWAR) [N66001-10-1-4008]; National Science Foundation through an Emerging Frontiers in Research and Innovation (EFRI) programme,"The work on integration schemes and mechanical designs was supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Nanoelectromechanical /Microelectromechanical Science & Technology (N/MEMS S&T) Fundamentals programme under grant number N66001-10-1-4008 issued by the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Pacific (SPAWAR).

Non-mass-dependent (NMD) sulphur isotope anomalies in the rock record(1) are the central tool used to reconstruct the redox history of the early atmosphere. The generation and initial delivery of these anomalies to marine sediments requires low partial pressures of atmospheric O-2 (p(O2); refs 2, 3), and the disappearance of NMD anomalies from the rock record 2.32 billion years ago(1,4) is thought to have signalled a departure from persistently low atmospheric oxygen levels (less than about 10(-5) times the present atmospheric level) during approximately the first two billion years of Earth's history. Here we present a model study designed to describe the long-term surface recycling of crustal NMD anomalies, and show that the record of this geochemical signal is likely to display a 'crustalmemory effect' following increases in atmospheric p(O2) above this threshold. Once NMD anomalies have been buried in the upper crust they are extremely resistant to removal, and can be erased only through successive cycles of weathering, dilution and burial on an oxygenated Earth surface. This recycling results in the residual incorporation ofNMDanomalies into the sedimentary record long after synchronous atmospheric generation of the isotopic signal has ceased, with dynamic and measurable signals probably surviving for as long as 10-100 million years subsequent to an increase in atmospheric p(O2) to more than 10(-5) times the present atmospheric level. Our results can reconcile geochemical evidence for oxygen production and transient accumulation with the maintenance of NMD anomalies on the early Earth(5-8), and suggest that future work should investigate the notion that temporally continuous generation of new NMD sulphur isotope anomalies in the atmosphere was likely to have ceased long before their ultimate disappearance from the rock record.","[Reinhard, Christopher T.; Planavsky, Noah J.] CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, Pasadena, CA 91126 USA; [Reinhard, Christopher T.; Planavsky, Noah J.; Lyons, Timothy W.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Earth Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA","Reinhard, CT (reprint author), CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, Pasadena, CA 91126 USA.",reinhard@caltech.edu,,,NSF-EAR; NASA Exobiology Program; O.

When and how these defining functional traits evolved remains controversial(1-8). However, the advent of computer modelling approaches and the discoveries of exceptionally preserved key specimens now make it possible to use quantitative data on whole-body morphology to address the biomechanics underlying this issue. Here we use digital body reconstructions to quantify evolutionary trends in locomotor biomechanics (whole-body proportions and centre-of-mass position) across the clade Archosauria. We use three-dimensional digital reconstruction to estimate body shape from skeletal dimensions for 17 archosaurs along the ancestral bird line, including the exceptionally preserved, feathered taxa Microraptor, Archaeopteryx, Pengornis and Yixia-nornis, which represent key stages in the evolution of the avian body plan. Rather than a discrete transition from more-upright postures in the basal-most birds (Avialae) and their immediate outgroup deinonychosauria(5,6), our results support hypotheses of a gradual, stepwise acquisition of more-crouched limb postures across much of theropod evolution(1-4), although we find evidence of an accelerated change within the clade Maniraptora (birds and their closest relatives, such as deinonychosaurs). In addition, whereas reduction of the tail is widely accepted to be the primary morphological factor correlated with centre-of-mass position and, hence, evolution of hindlimb posture(1-8), we instead find that enlargement of the pectoral limb and several associated trends have a much stronger influence. Intriguingly, our support for the onset of accelerated morpho-functional trends within Maniraptora is closely correlated with the evolution of flight. Because we find that the evolution of enlarged forelimbs is strongly linked, via whole-body centre of mass, to hindlimb function during terrestrial locomotion, we suggest that the evolution of avian flight is linked to anatomical novelties in the pelvic limb as well as the pectoral.","[Allen, Vivian] Univ Jena, Inst Spezielle Zool & Evolut Biol, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Allen, Vivian; Hutchinson, John R.] Univ London Royal Vet Coll, Struct & Mot Lab, Hatfield AL9 7TA, Herts, England; [Bates, Karl T.] Univ Liverpool, Inst Ageing & Chron Dis, Dept Musculoskeletal Biol 2, Liverpool L69 3GA, Merseyside, England; [Li, Zhiheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Paleontol & Paleoanthropol, Key Lab Evolutionary Systemat Vertebrates, Beijing 100034, Peoples R China; [Li, Zhiheng] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Geol Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Hutchinson, JR (reprint author), Univ London Royal Vet Coll, Struct & Mot Lab, Hatfield AL9 7TA, Herts, England.",jrhutch@rvc.ac.uk,,"Hutchinson, John/0000-0002-6767-7038",NERC [NE/G005877/1]; Royal Society International Joint Project; Sam and Doris Welles Fund (University of California),"We thank the following people and institutions for access to fossil specimens: S.

Repeat biopsies to study genomic evolution as a result of therapy are difficult, invasive and may be confounded by intra-tumour heterogeneity(3,4). Recent studies have shown that genomic alterations in solid cancers can be characterized by massively parallel sequencing of circulating cell-free tumour DNA released from cancer cells into plasma, representing a noninvasive liquid biopsy(5-7). Here we report sequencing of cancer exomes in serial plasma samples to track genomic evolution of metastatic cancers in response to therapy. Six patients with advanced breast, ovarian and lung cancers were followed over 1-2 years. For each case, exome sequencing was performed on 2-5 plasma samples (19 in total) spanning multiple courses of treatment, at selected time points when the allele fraction of tumour mutations in plasma was high, allowing improved sensitivity. For two cases, synchronous biopsies were also analysed, confirming genome-wide representation of the tumour genome in plasma. Quantification of allele fractions in plasma identified increased representation of mutant alleles in association with emergence of therapy resistance. These included an activating mutation in PIK3CA (phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha) following treatment with paclitaxel(8); a truncating mutation in RB1 (retinoblastoma 1) following treatment with cisplatin(9); a truncating mutation in MED1 (mediator complex subunit 1) following treatment with tamoxifen and trastuzumab(10,11), and following subsequent treatment with lapatinib(12,13), a splicing mutation in GAS6 (growth arrest-specific 6) in the same patient; and a resistance-conferring mutation in EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor; T790M) following treatment with gefitinib(14). These results establish proof of principle that exome-wide analysis of circulating tumour DNA could complement current invasive biopsy approaches to identify mutations associated with acquired drug resistance in advanced cancers. Serial analysis of cancer genomes in plasma constitutes a new paradigm for the study of clonal evolution in human cancers.","[Murtaza, Muhammed; Dawson, Sarah-Jane; Tsui, Dana W.

Kenyon cells, the intrinsic neurons of the mushroom body, integrate input from olfactory glomeruli to encode odours as sparse distributed patterns of neural activity(2,3). We have developed anatomic tracing techniques to identify the glomerular origin of the inputs that converge onto 200 individual Kenyon cells. Here we show that each Kenyon cell integrates input from a different and apparently random combination of glomeruli. The glomerular inputs to individual Kenyon cells show no discernible organization with respect to their odour tuning, anatomic features or developmental origins. Moreover, different classes of Kenyon cells do not seem to preferentially integrate inputs from specific combinations of glomeruli. This organization of glomerular connections to the mushroom body could allow the fly to contextualize novel sensory experiences, a feature consistent with the role of this brain centre in mediating learned olfactory associations and behaviours.","[Caron, Sophie J.

Biorientation is ensured by Aurora B kinase (Ipl1), a member of the four-subunit chromosomal passenger complex (CPC)(1,2). Localization of the CPC to the inner centromere is central to the current model for how tension ensures chromosome biorientation: kinetochore-spindle attachments that are not under tension remain close to the inner centromere and are destabilized by Aurora B phosphorylation, whereas kinetochores under tension are pulled away from the influence of Aurora B, stabilizing their microtubule attachments(3-5). Here we show that an engineered truncation of the Sli15 (known as INCENP in humans) subunit of budding yeast CPC that eliminates association with the inner centromere nevertheless supports proper chromosome segregation during both mitosis and meiosis. Truncated Sli15 suppresses the deletion phenotypes of the innercentromere-targeting proteins survivin (Bir1), borealin (Nbl1), Bub1 and Sgo1 (ref. 6). Unlike wild-type Sli15, truncated Sli15 localizes to pre-anaphase spindle microtubules. Premature targeting of full-length Sli15 to microtubules by preventing Cdk1 (also known as Cdc28) phosphorylation also suppresses the inviability of Bir1 deletion. These results suggest that activation of Aurora B kinase by clustering either on chromatin or on microtubules is sufficient for chromosome biorientation.","[Campbell, Christopher S.; Desai, Arshad] Univ Calif San Diego, Ludwig Inst Canc Res, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Campbell, Christopher S.; Desai, Arshad] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Cellular & Mol Med, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Desai, A (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Ludwig Inst Canc Res, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",abdesai@ucsd.edu,,"Campbell, Christopher/0000-0002-3927-344X",National Institutes of Health (NIH) [GM074215]; Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation Fellowship [DRG 2007-09]; Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research,"The authors would like to thank the Desai and Oegema laboratories for discussions; S.

Here we show that IDAX (also known as CXXC4), a reported inhibitor of Wnt signalling(7) that has been implicated in malignant renal cell carcinoma(8) and colonic villous adenoma(9), regulates TET2 protein expression. IDAX was originally encoded within an ancestral TET2 gene that underwent a chromosomal gene inversion during evolution, thus separating the TET2 CXXC domain from the catalytic domain. The IDAX CXXC domain binds DNA sequences containing unmethylated CpG dinucleotides, localizes to promoters and CpG islands in genomic DNA and interacts directly with the catalytic domain of TET2. Unexpectedly, IDAX expression results in caspase activation and TET2 protein downregulation, in a manner that depends on DNA binding through the IDAX CXXC domain, suggesting that IDAX recruits TET2 to DNA before degradation. IDAX depletion prevents TET2 downregulation in differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells, and short hairpin RNA against IDAX increases TET2 protein expression in the human monocytic cell line U937. Notably, we find that the expression and activity of TET3 is also regulated through its CXXC domain. Taken together, these results establish the separate and linked CXXC domains of TET2 and TET3, respectively, as previously unknown regulators of caspase activation and TET enzymatic activity.","[Ko, Myunggon; An, Jungeun; Bandukwala, Hozefa S.; Chavez, Lukas; Aijo, Tarmo; Pastor, William A.; Segal, Matthew F.; Hogan, Patrick G.; Rao, Anjana] La Jolla Inst Allergy & Immunol, Div Signaling & Gene Express, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Aijo, Tarmo; Lahdesmaki, Harri] Aalto Univ, Sch Sci, Dept Informat & Comp Sci, FI-00076 Aalto, Finland; [Li, Huiming; Koh, Kian Peng; Rao, Anjana] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Li, Huiming; Koh, Kian Peng; Rao, Anjana] Childrens Hosp, Program Cellular & Mol Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Aravind, L.] NIH, Natl Ctr Biotechnol Informat, Natl Lib Med, Bethesda, MD 20894 USA; [Rao, Anjana] Sanford Consortium Regenerat Med, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Rao, A (reprint author), La Jolla Inst Allergy & Immunol, Div Signaling & Gene Express, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",arao@liai.org,,"Koh, Kian Peng/0000-0003-2523-5175; Aravind, L/0000-0003-0771-253X; Chavez, Lukas/0000-0002-8718-8848","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [HD065812, CA151535]; California Institute of Regenerative Medicine and Translational Research [RM-01729]; Leukemia and Lymphoma Society [TRP 6187-12]; NIH [AI40127]; Leukemia and Lymphoma Society; Lady Tata Memorial Trust; GlaxoSmithKline-Immune Disease Institute Alliance; National Science Foundation","We thank G.

Variation in transcripts can affect messenger RNA stability, localization and translation(1), or produce truncated proteins that differ in localization(2) or function(3). Given the existence of overlapping, variable transcript isoforms, determining the functional impact of the transcriptome requires identification of full-length transcripts, rather than just the genomic regions that are transcribed(4,5). Here, by jointly determining both transcript ends for millions of RNA molecules, we reveal an extensive layer of isoform diversity previously hidden among overlapping RNA molecules. Variation in transcript boundaries seems to be the rule rather than the exception, even within a single population of yeast cells. Over 26 major transcript isoforms per protein-coding gene were expressed in yeast. Hundreds of short coding RNAs and truncated versions of proteins are concomitantly encoded by alternative transcript isoforms, increasing protein diversity. In addition, approximately 70% of genes express alternative isoforms that vary in post-transcriptional regulatory elements, and tandem genes frequently produce overlapping or even bicistronic transcripts. This extensive transcript diversity is generated by a relatively simple eukaryotic genome with limited splicing, and within a genetically homogeneous population of cells. Our findings have implications for genome compaction, evolution and phenotypic diversity between single cells. These data also indicate that isoform diversity as well as RNA abundance should be considered when assessing the functional repertoire of genomes.","[Pelechano, Vicent; Wei, Wu; Steinmetz, Lars M.] European Mol Biol Lab EMBL, Genome Biol Unit, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Wei, Wu; Steinmetz, Lars M.] Stanford Univ, Stanford Genome Technol Ctr, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA","Steinmetz, LM (reprint author), European Mol Biol Lab EMBL, Genome Biol Unit, Meyerhofstr 1, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany.",larsms@embl.de,"Pelechano, Vicent/A-8431-2011","Pelechano, Vicent/0000-0002-9415-788X; Steinmetz, Lars/0000-0002-3962-2865",National Institutes of Health; EMBO fellowship,"We thank R.

These bacteria apparently catalyse the formation of methane through the cleavage of the highly unreactive carbon-phosphorus bond inmethylphosphonate(MPn), but the biological or terrestrial source of this compound is unclear(2). However, the ocean-dwelling bacterium Nitrosopumilus maritimus catalyses the biosynthesis of MPn from 2-hydroxyethyl phosphonate(3) and the bacterial C-P lyase complex is known to convert MPn to methane(4-7). In addition to MPn, the bacterial C-P lyase complex catalyses C-P bond cleavage of many alkyl phosphonates when the environmental concentration of phosphate is low(4-7). PhnJ from the C-P lyase complex catalyses an unprecedented C-P bond cleavage reaction of ribose-1-phosphonate-5-phosphate to methane and ribose-1,2-cyclic-phosphate-5-phosphate. This reaction requires a redox-active [4Fe-4S]-cluster and S-adenosyl-L-methionine, which is reductively cleaved to L-methionine and 5'-deoxyadenosine(8). Here we show that PhnJ is a novel radical S-adenosyl-L-methionine enzyme that catalyses C-P bond cleavage through the initial formation of a 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical and two protein-based radicals localized at Gly 32 and Cys 272. During this transformation, the pro-R hydrogen from Gly 32 is transferred to the 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical to form 5'-deoxyadenosine and the pro-S hydrogen is transferred to the radical intermediate that ultimately generates methane. A comprehensive reaction mechanism is proposed for cleavage of the C-P bond by the C-P lyase complex that uses a covalent thiophosphate intermediate for methane and phosphate formation.","[Kamat, Siddhesh S.; Williams, Howard J.; Chakrabarti, Mrinmoy; Raushel, Frank M.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Chem, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Dangott, Lawrence J.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Prot Chem Lab, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Raushel, FM (reprint author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Chem, POB 30012, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",raushel@tamu.edu,"Raushel, Frank/B-7125-2015","Raushel, Frank/0000-0002-5918-3089",Robert A.

G proteins mediate activation of second-messenger-generating enzymes and other effectors, GRKs phosphorylate activated receptors(2), and arrestins subsequently bind phosphorylated receptors and cause receptor desensitization(3). Arrestins activated by interaction with phosphorylated receptors can also mediate G-protein-independent signalling by serving as adaptors to link receptors to numerous signalling pathways(4). Despite their central role in regulation and signalling of GPCRs, a structural understanding of beta-arrestin activation and interaction with GPCRs is still lacking. Here we report the crystal structure of beta-arrestin-1 (also called arrestin-2) in complex with a fully phosphorylated 29-amino-acid carboxy-terminal peptide derived from the human V2 vasopressin receptor (V2Rpp). This peptide has previously been shown to functionally and conformationally activate beta-arrestin-1 (ref. 5). To capture this active conformation, we used a conformationally selective synthetic antibody fragment (Fab30) that recognizes the phosphopeptide-activated state of beta-arrestin-1. The structure of the beta-arrestin-1-V2Rpp-Fab30 complex shows marked conformational differences in beta-arrestin-1 compared to its inactive conformation. These include rotation of the amino- and carboxy-terminal domains relative to each other, and a major reorientation of the 'lariat loop' implicated in maintaining the inactive state of beta-arrestin-1. These results reveal, at high resolution, a receptor-interacting interface on beta-arrestin, and they indicate a potentially general molecular mechanism for activation of these multifunctional signalling and regulatory proteins.","[Shukla, Arun K.; Xiao, Kunhong; Reis, Rosana I.; Tseng, Wei-Chou; Staus, Dean P.; Huang, Li-Yin; Tripathi-Shukla, Prachi; Lefkowitz, Robert J.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Med, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Manglik, Aashish; Kruse, Andrew C.; Hilger, Daniel; Weis, William I.; Kobilka, Brian K.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Uysal, Serdar; Paduch, Marcin; Koide, Akiko; Koide, Shohei; Kossiakoff, Anthony A.] Univ Chicago, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Weis, William I.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Struct, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lefkowitz, Robert J.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Lefkowitz, Robert J.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Biochem, Durham, NC 27706 USA","Kobilka, BK (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",kobilka@stanford.edu; lefko001@receptor-biol.duke.edu,"Weis, William/G-1437-2011","Weis, William/0000-0002-5583-6150; shukla, arun/0000-0003-2910-8288; Koide, Shohei/0000-0001-5473-4358","Stanford Medical Scientist Training Program; American Heart Association; National Science Foundation; National Institutes of Health [NS028471, HL16037, HL70631, GM072688, GM087519, HL 075443]; Mathers Foundation; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior-CAPES","We thank D.

Arrestins have a bi-lobed structure that is stabilized by a long carboxy-terminal tail (C-tail), and displacement of the C-tail by receptor-attached phosphates activates arrestins for binding active GPCRs(4). Structures of the inactive state of arrestin are available(5,6), but it is not known how C-tail displacement activates arrestin for receptor coupling. Here we present a 3.0 angstrom crystal structure of the bovine arrestin-1 splice variant p44, in which the activation step is mimicked by C-tail truncation. The structure of this pre-activated arrestin is profoundly different from the basal state and gives insight into the activation mechanism. p44 displays breakage of the central polar core and other interlobe hydrogen-bond networks, leading to a 216 rotation of the two lobes as compared to basal arrestin-1. Rearrangements in key receptor-binding loops in the central crest region include the finger loop(7-9), loop 139 (refs 8, 10, 11) and the sequence Asp 296-Asn 305 (or gate loop), here identified as controlling the polar core. We verified the role of these conformational alterations in arrestin activation and receptor binding by site-directed fluorescence spectroscopy. The data indicate a mechanism for arrestin activation in which C-tail displacement releases critical central-crest loops from restricted to extended receptor-interacting conformations. In parallel, increased flexibility between the two lobes facilitates a proper fitting of arrestin to the active receptor surface. Our results provide a snapshot of an arrestin ready to bind the active receptor, and give an insight into the role of naturally occurring truncated arrestins in the visual system.","[Kim, Yong Ju; Hofmann, Klaus Peter; Choe, Hui-Woog; Sommer, Martha E.] Charite, Inst Med Phys & Biophys CC2, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Hofmann, Klaus Peter] Humboldt Univ, Zentrum Biophys & Bioinformat, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Ernst, Oliver P.] Univ Toronto, Dept Biochem, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [Ernst, Oliver P.] Univ Toronto, Dept Mol Genet, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [Scheerer, Patrick] Charite, AG Prot Xray Crystallog, Inst Med Phys & Biophys CC2, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Choe, Hui-Woog] Chonbuk Natl Univ, Coll Nat Sci, Dept Chem, Chonju 561756, South Korea","Sommer, ME (reprint author), Charite, Inst Med Phys & Biophys CC2, Charitepl 1, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",patrick.scheerer@charite.de; hwchoe@chonbuk.ac.kr; martha.sommer@charite.de,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB449, SFB740, SFB1078-B6, SO1037/1-2]; DFG Cluster of Excellence 'Unifying Concepts in Catalysis' [D3/E3-1]; European Research Council [ERC-2009/249910-TUDOR]; Canada Excellence Research Chair program; Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea; Ministry of Education, Science and Technology [2012R1A1A2044752]","We thank J.

It is therefore of fundamental and practical interest to devise tests that reveal whether the system is behaving as instructed. In 1969, Clauser, Horne, Shimony and Holt proposed an experimental test that can be passed by a quantum-mechanical system but not by a system restricted to classical physics. Here we extend this test to enable the characterization of a large quantum system. We describe a scheme that can be used to determine the initial state and to classically command the system to evolve according to desired dynamics. The bipartite system is treated as two black boxes, with no assumptions about their inner workings except that they obey quantum physics. The scheme works even if the system is explicitly designed to undermine it; any misbehaviour is detected. Among its applications, our scheme makes it possible to test whether a claimed quantum computer is truly quantum. It also advances towards a goal of quantum cryptography: namely, the use of 'untrusted' devices to establish a shared random key, with security based on the validity of quantum physics.","[Reichardt, Ben W.] Univ So Calif, Dept Elect Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Unger, Falk] Knight Capital Grp Inc, Santa Clara, CA 95054 USA; [Vazirani, Umesh] Univ Calif Berkeley, Div Comp Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Reichardt, BW (reprint author), Univ So Calif, Dept Elect Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",ben.reichardt@usc.edu,,,NSERC; ARO-DTO; Mitacs; US NSF [CCF-0905626]; Templeton grant [21674],"We thank E.

Recent studies that reconstructed regulatory networks in mammalian cells have focused on short-term responses and relied on perturbation-based approaches that cannot be readily applied to primary T cells. Here we combine transcriptional profiling at high temporal resolution, novel computational algorithms, and innovative nanowire-based perturbation tools to systematically derive and experimentally validate a model of the dynamic regulatory network that controls the differentiation of mouse T(H)17 cells, a proinflammatory T-cell subset that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple autoimmune diseases. The T(H)17 transcriptional network consists of two self-reinforcing, but mutually antagonistic, modules, with 12 novel regulators, the coupled action of which may be essential for maintaining the balance between T(H)17 and other CD41 T-cell subsets. Our study identifies and validates 39 regulatory factors, embeds them within a comprehensive temporal network and reveals its organizational principles; it also highlights novel drug targets for controlling T(H)17 cell differentiation.","[Yosef, Nir; Gennert, David; Satija, Rahul; Lu, Diana Y.; Trombetta, John J.; Park, Hongkun; Kuchroo, Vijay K.; Regev, Aviv] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Yosef, Nir; Jin, Hulin; Lee, Youjin; Awasthi, Amit; Wu, Chuan; Karwacz, Katarzyna; Xiao, Sheng; Kuchroo, Vijay K.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Ctr Neurol Dis, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Shalek, Alex K.; Gaublomme, Jellert T.; Jorgolli, Marsela; Park, Hongkun] Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Shalek, Alex K.; Gaublomme, Jellert T.; Jorgolli, Marsela; Park, Hongkun] Harvard Univ, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Shakya, Arvind; Tantin, Dean] Univ Utah, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Salt Lake City, UT 84132 USA; [Pillai, Meenu R.; Bix, Mark] St Jude Childrens Res Hosp, Dept Immunol, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Ratcliffe, Peter J.; Coleman, Mathew L.] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX3 7BN, England; [Regev, Aviv] MIT, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02140 USA","Park, H (reprint author), Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, 7 Cambridge Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",Hongkun_Park@harvard.edu; vkuchroo@rics.bwh.harvard.edu; aregev@broad.mit.edu,"Coleman, Mathew/C-1676-2014","Coleman, Mathew/0000-0001-6020-9023; Bix, Mark/0000-0003-4617-0497; Ratcliffe, Peter/0000-0002-2853-806X; Wu, Chuan/0000-0003-2288-353X; Shalek, Alex K./0000-0001-5670-8778","NHGRI [1P50HG006193-01]; NIH Pioneer Awards [5DP1OD003893-03, DP1OD003958-01]; NIH [NS 30843, NS045937, AI073748, AI45757]; National MS Society [RG2571]; HHMI; Klarman Cell Observatory","We thank L.

However, cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies arise in approximately 20% of HIV-1-infected individuals, and details of their generation could provide a blueprint for effective vaccination. Here we report the isolation, evolution and structure of a broadly neutralizing antibody from an African donor followed from the time of infection. The mature antibody, CH103, neutralized approximately 55% of HIV-1 isolates, and its co-crystal structure with the HIV-1 envelope protein gp120 revealed a new loop-based mechanism of CD4-binding-site recognition. Virus and antibody gene sequencing revealed concomitant virus evolution and antibody maturation. Notably, the unmutated common ancestor of the CH103 lineage avidly bound the transmitted/founder HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein, and evolution of antibody neutralization breadth was preceded by extensive viral diversification in and near the CH103 epitope. These data determine the viral and antibody evolution leading to induction of a lineage of HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies, and provide insights into strategies to elicit similar antibodies by vaccination.","[Liao, Hua-Xin; Gao, Feng; Alam, S.

However, methods for evaluating mass and validating SAS-based models and resolution have been inadequate. Here we define the volume of correlation, V-c, a SAS invariant derived from the scattered intensities that is specific to the structural state of the particle, but independent of concentration and the requirements of a compact, folded particle. We show that V-c defines a ratio, Q(R), that determines the molecular mass of proteins or RNA ranging from 10 to 1,000 kilodaltons. Furthermore, we propose a statistically robust method for assessing model-data agreements (chi(2)(free)) akin to cross-validation. Our approach prevents over-fitting of the SAS data and can be used with a newly defined metric, R-SAS, for quantitative evaluation of resolution. Together, these metrics (V-c, Q(R), chi(2)(free) and R-SAS) provide analytical tools for unbiased and accurate macromolecular structural characterizations in solution.","[Rambo, Robert P.; Tainer, John A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Adv Light Source, Div Life Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Tainer, John A.] Scripps Res Inst, Skaggs Inst Chem Biol, Dept Integrat Struct & Computat Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Rambo, RP (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Adv Light Source, Div Life Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",rprambo@lbl.gov; jat@scripps.edu,,,"Office of Science, US Department of Energy on Novel Technology for Structural Biology; United States Department of Energy program Integrated Diffraction Analysis Technologies [DEAC02-05CH11231]; National Institutes of Health [R01GM105404]","We thank G.

The geometric phase is determined only by the shape of this path(1-3) and is, in its simplest form, a real number. However, if the system has degenerate energy levels, then matrix-valued geometric state transformations, known as non-Abelian holonomies-the effect of which depends on the order of two consecutive paths-can be obtained(4). They are important, for example, for the creation of synthetic gauge fields in cold atomic gases(5) or the description of non-Abelian anyon statistics(6,7). Moreover, there are proposals(8,9) to exploit non-Abelian holonomic gates for the purposes of noise-resilient quantum computation. In contrast to Abelian geometric operations(10), non-Abelian ones have been observed only in nuclear quadrupole resonance experiments with a large number of spins, and without full characterization of the geometric process and its non-commutative nature(11,12). Here we realize non-Abelian non-adiabatic holonomic quantum operations(13,14) on a single, superconducting, artificial three-level atom(15) by applying a well-controlled, two-tone microwave drive. Using quantum process tomography, we determine fidelities of the resulting non-commuting gates that exceed 95 per cent. We show that two different quantum gates, originating from two distinct paths in Hilbert space, yield non-equivalent transformations when applied in different orders. This provides evidence for the non-Abelian character of the implemented holonomic quantum operations. In combination with a non-trivial two-quantum-bit gate, our method suggests a way to universal holonomic quantum computing.","[Abdumalikov, A. A., Jr.; Fink, J.

However, existing techniques either have poor spatial resolution compared to optical microscopy and are hence not generally applicable to imaging of sub-cellular structure (for example, magnetic resonance imaging(1)), or entail operating conditions that preclude application to living biological samples while providing submicrometre resolution (for example, scanning superconducting quantum interference device microscopy(2), electron holography(3) and magnetic resonance force microscopy(4)). Here we demonstrate magnetic imaging of living cells (magnetotactic bacteria) under ambient laboratory conditions and with sub-cellular spatial resolution (400 nanometres), using an optically detected magnetic field imaging array consisting of a nanometre-scale layer of nitrogen-vacancy colour centres implanted at the surface of a diamond chip. With the bacteria placed on the diamond surface, we optically probe the nitrogen-vacancy quantum spin states and rapidly reconstruct images of the vector components of the magnetic field created by chains of magnetic nanoparticles (magnetosomes) produced in the bacteria. We also spatially correlate these magnetic field maps with optical images acquired in the same apparatus. Wide-field microscopy allows parallel optical and magnetic imaging of multiple cells in a population with submicrometre resolution and a field of view in excess of 100 micrometres. Scanning electron microscope images of the bacteria confirm that the correlated optical and magnetic images can be used to locate and characterize the magnetosomes in each bacterium. Our results provide a new capability for imaging bio-magnetic structures in living cells under ambient conditions with high spatial resolution, and will enable the mapping of a wide range of magnetic signals within cells and cellular networks(5,6).","[Le Sage, D.; Glenn, D.

However, the residence time of these subducted materials in the mantle is uncertain and model-dependent(3), and compelling evidence for their return to the surface in regions of mantle upwelling beneath hotspots is lacking. Here we report anomalous sulphur isotope signatures indicating mass-independent fractionation (MIF) in olivine-hosted sulphides from 20-million-year-old ocean island basalts from Mangaia, Cook Islands (Polynesia), which have been suggested to sample recycled oceanic crust(3,4). Terrestrial MIF sulphur isotope signatures (in which the amount of fractionation does not scale in proportion with the difference in the masses of the isotopes) were generated exclusively through atmospheric photochemical reactions until about 2.45 billion years ago(5-7). Therefore, the discovery of MIF sulphur in these young plume lavas suggests that sulphur-probably derived from hydrothermally altered oceanic crust-was subducted into the mantle before 2.45 billion years ago and recycled into the mantle source of Mangaia lavas. These new data provide evidence for ancient materials, with negative Delta S-33 values, in the mantle source for Mangaia lavas. Our data also complement evidence for recycling of the sulphur content of ancient sedimentary materials to the subcontinental lithospheric mantle that has been identified in diamond-hosted sulphide inclusions(8,9). This Archaean age for recycled oceanic crust also provides key constraints on the length of time that subducted crustal material can survive in the mantle, and on the timescales of mantle convection from subduction to upwelling beneath hotspots.","[Cabral, Rita A.; Jackson, Matthew G.] Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Rose-Koga, Estelle F.; Koga, Kenneth T.] Univ Clermont Ferrand, CNRS, UMR6524, Lab Magmas & Volcans,IRD R163, F-63038 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Whitehouse, Martin J.] Swedish Museum Nat Hist, SE-10405 Stockholm, Sweden; [Whitehouse, Martin J.] Stockholm Univ, Dept Geol Sci, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Antonelli, Michael A.; Farquhar, James] Univ Maryland, Dept Geol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Antonelli, Michael A.; Farquhar, James] Univ Maryland, ESSIC, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Day, James M.

A central problem is that the biological activity of these genes is often unclear. Detailed investigations in model vertebrate organisms, typically mice, have been essential for understanding the activities of many orthologues of these disease-associated genes. Although gene-targeting approaches(1-3) and phenotype analysis have led to a detailed understanding of nearly 6,000 protein-coding genes(3,4), this number falls considerably short of the more than 22,000 mouse protein-coding genes(5). Similarly, in zebrafish genetics, one-by-one gene studies using positional cloning(6), insertional mutagenesis(7-9), antisense morpholino oligonucleotides(10), targeted re-sequencing(11-13), and zinc finger and TAL endonucleases(14-17) have made substantial contributions to our understanding of the biological activity of vertebrate genes, but again the number of genes studied falls well short of the more than 26,000 zebrafish protein-coding genes(18). Importantly, for both mice and zebrafish, none of these strategies are particularly suited to the rapid generation of knockouts in thousands of genes and the assessment of their biological activity. Here we describe an active project that aims to identify and phenotype the disruptive mutations in every zebrafish protein-coding gene, using a well-annotated zebrafish reference genome sequence(18,19), high-throughput sequencing and efficient chemical mutagenesis. So far we have identified potentially disruptive mutations in more than 38% of all known zebrafish protein-coding genes. We have developed a multi-allelic phenotyping scheme to efficiently assess the effects of each allele during embryogenesis and have analysed the phenotypic consequences of over 1,000 alleles. All mutant alleles and data are available to the community and our phenotyping scheme is adaptable to phenotypic analysis beyond embryogenesis.","[Kettleborough, Ross N.

The virtually transparent embryos of this species, and the ability to accelerate genetic studies by gene knockdown or overexpression, have led to the widespread use of zebrafish in the detailed investigation of vertebrate gene function and increasingly, the study of human genetic disease(3-5). However, for effective modelling of human genetic disease it is important to understand the extent to which zebrafish genes and gene structures are related to orthologous human genes. To examine this, we generated a high-quality sequence assembly of the zebrafish genome, made up of an overlapping set of completely sequenced large-insert clones that were ordered and oriented using a high-resolution high-density meiotic map. Detailed automatic and manual annotation provides evidence of more than 26,000 protein-coding genes(6), the largest gene set of any vertebrate so far sequenced. Comparison to the human reference genome shows that approximately 70% of human genes have at least one obvious zebrafish orthologue. In addition, the high quality of this genome assembly provides a clearer understanding of key genomic features such as a unique repeat content, a scarcity of pseudogenes, an enrichment of zebrafish-specific genes on chromosome 4 and chromosomal regions that influence sex determination.","[Howe, Kerstin; Clark, Matthew D.; Torroja, Carlos F.; Torrance, James; Collins, John E.; Humphray, Sean; McLaren, Karen; Matthews, Lucy; McLaren, Stuart; Sealy, Ian; Churcher, Carol; Scott, Carol; Barrett, Jeffrey C.; White, Simon; Chow, William; Kilian, Britt; Gu, Yong; Yen, Jennifer; Vogel, Jan-Hinnerk; Eyre, Tina; Redmond, Seth; Banerjee, Ruby; Chi, Jianxiang; Fu, Beiyuan; Langley, Elizabeth; Maguire, Sean F.; Laird, Gavin K.; Lloyd, David; Kenyon, Emma; Donaldson, Sarah; Sehra, Harminder; Almeida-King, Jeff; Loveland, Jane; Trevanion, Stephen; Jones, Matt; Quail, Mike; Willey, Dave; Hunt, Adrienne; Burton, John; Sims, Sarah; McLay, Kirsten; Plumb, Bob; Davis, Joy; Clee, Chris; Oliver, Karen; Clark, Richard; Riddle, Clare; Eliott, David; Threadgold, Glen; Harden, Glenn; Ware, Darren; Mortimer, Beverly; Kerry, Giselle; Heath, Paul; Phillimore, Benjamin; Tracey, Alan; Corby, Nicole; Dunn, Matthew; Johnson, Christopher; Wood, Jonathan; Clark, Susan; Pelan, Sarah; Griffiths, Guy; Smith, Michelle; Glithero, Rebecca; Howden, Philip; Barker, Nicholas; Stevens, Christopher; Harley, Joanna; Holt, Karen; Panagiotidis, Georgios; Lovell, Jamieson; Beasley, Helen; Henderson, Carl; Gordon, Daria; Auger, Katherine; Wright, Deborah; Collins, Joanna; Raisen, Claire; Dyer, Lauren; Leung, Kenric; Robertson, Lauren; Ambridge, Kirsty; Leongamornlert, Daniel; McGuire, Sarah; Gilderthorp, Ruth; Griffiths, Coline; Manthravadi, Deepa; Nichol, Sarah; Barker, Gary; Whitehead, Siobhan; Kay, Michael; Brown, Jacqueline; Murnane, Clare; Gray, Emma; Humphries, Matthew; Sycamore, Neil; Barker, Darren; Saunders, David; Wallis, Justene; Babbage, Anne; Hammond, Sian; Mashreghi-Mohammadi, Maryam; Barr, Lucy; Martin, Sancha; Wray, Paul; Ellington, Andrew; Matthews, Nicholas; Ellwood, Matthew; Woodmansey, Rebecca; Clark, Graham; Cooper, James; Tromans, Anthony; Grafham, Darren; Skuce, Carl; Pandian, Richard; Andrews, Robert; Harrison, Elliot; Kimberley, Andrew; Garnett, Jane; Fosker, Nigel; Hall, Rebekah; Garner, Patrick; Kelly, Daniel; Bird, Christine; Palmer, Sophie; Berger, Andrea; Dooley, Christopher M.; Widaa, Sara; Langford, Cordelia; Yang, Fengtang; Carter, Nigel P.; Harrow, Jennifer; Ning, Zemin; Searle, Steve M.

For some patients, dengue is a life-threatening illness(2). There are currently no licensed vaccines or specific therapeutics, and substantial vector control efforts have not stopped its rapid emergence and global spread(3). The contemporary worldwide distribution of the risk of dengue virus infection(4) and its public health burden are poorly known(2,5). Here we undertake an exhaustive assembly of known records of dengue occurrence worldwide, and use a formal modelling framework to map the global distribution of dengue risk. We then pair the resulting risk map with detailed longitudinal information from dengue cohort studies and population surfaces to infer the public health burden of dengue in 2010. We predict dengue to be ubiquitous throughout the tropics, with local spatial variations in risk influenced strongly by rainfall, temperature and the degree of urbanization. Using cartographic approaches, we estimate there to be 390 million (95% credible interval 284-528) dengue infections per year, of which 96 million (67-136) manifest apparently (any level of disease severity). This infection total is more than three times the dengue burden estimate of the World Health Organization(2). Stratification of our estimates by country allows comparison with national dengue reporting, after taking into account the probability of an apparent infection being formally reported. The most notable differences are discussed. These new risk maps and infection estimates provide novel insights into the global, regional and national public health burden imposed by dengue.

The conservation of the cellular membrane, combined with its accessibility to secreted proteins, has made it a common target of factors mediating antagonistic interactions between diverse organisms. Here we report the discovery of a diverse superfamily of bacterial phospholipase enzymes. Within this superfamily, we defined enzymes with phospholipase A(1) and A(2) activity, which are common in host-cell-targeting bacterial toxins and the venoms of certain insects and reptiles(1,2). However, we find that the fundamental role of the superfamily is to mediate antagonistic bacterial interactions as effectors of the type VI secretion system (T6SS) translocation apparatus; accordingly, we name these proteins type VI lipase effectors. Our analyses indicate that PldA of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a eukaryotic-like phospholipase D-3, is a member of the type VI lipase effector superfamily and the founding substrate of the haemolysin co-regulated protein secretion island II T6SS (H2-T6SS). Although previous studies have specifically implicated PldA and the H2-T6SS in pathogenesis(3-5), we uncovered a specific role for the effector and its secretory machinery in intra-and interspecies bacterial interactions. Furthermore, we find that this effector achieves its antibacterial activity by degrading phosphatidylethanolamine, the major component of bacterial membranes. The surprising finding that virulence-associated phospholipases can serve as specific antibacterial effectors suggests that interbacterial interactions are a relevant factor driving the continuing evolution of pathogenesis.","[Russell, Alistair B.; LeRoux, Michele; Agnello, Danielle M.; Mougous, Joseph D.] Univ Washington, Dept Microbiol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [LeRoux, Michele; Mougous, Joseph D.] Univ Washington, Mol & Cellular Biol Program, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Hathazi, Krisztina; Ishikawa, Takahiko; Wai, Sun Nyunt] Umea Univ, Dept Mol Biol, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Hathazi, Krisztina; Ishikawa, Takahiko; Wai, Sun Nyunt] Umea Univ, Lab Mol Infect Med Sweden MIMS, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Wiggins, Paul A.] Univ Washington, Dept Phys, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Wiggins, Paul A.] Univ Washington, Dept Bioengn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Mougous, JD (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Microbiol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",mougous@u.washington.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health (NIH) [AI080609, AI057141, AI105268, GM07270]; Cystic Fibrosis Foundation [CFR565-CR07]; National Science Foundation [PHY-084845, MCB-1151043, DGE-0718124]; Swedish Research Council [2010-3073, 2007-8673 UCMR Linnaeus, 2006-7431 MIMS]; Faculty of Medicine, Umea University; University of Washington Royalty Research Fund; Sloan Foundation; Burroughs Wellcome Fund","We thank H.

IL-23 has a critical role in stabilizing and reinforcing the T(H)17 phenotype by increasing expression of IL-23 receptor (IL-23R) and endowing T(H)17 cells with pathogenic effector functions(2,3). However, the precise molecular mechanism by which IL-23 sustains the T(H)17 response and induces pathogenic effector functions has not been elucidated. Here we used transcriptional profiling of developing T(H)17 cells to construct a model of their signalling network and nominate major nodes that regulate T(H)17 development. We identified serum glucocorticoid kinase 1 (SGK1), a serine/threonine kinase(4), as an essential node downstream of IL-23 signalling. SGK1 is critical for regulating IL-23R expression and stabilizing the T(H)17 cell phenotype by deactivation of mouse Foxo1, a direct repressor of IL-23R expression. SGK1 has been shown to govern Na+ transport and salt (NaCl) homeostasis in other cells(5-8). We show here that a modest increase in salt concentration induces SGK1 expression, promotes IL-23R expression and enhances T(H)17 cell differentiation in vitro and in vivo, accelerating the development of autoimmunity. Loss of SGK1 abrogated Na+-mediated T(H)17 differentiation in an IL-23-dependent manner. These data demonstrate that SGK1 has a critical role in the induction of pathogenic T(H)17 cells and provide a molecular insight into a mechanism by which an environmental factor such as a high salt diet triggers T(H)17 development and promotes tissue inflammation.","[Wu, Chuan; Yosef, Nir; Thalhamer, Theresa; Zhu, Chen; Xiao, Sheng; Kishi, Yasuhiro; Kuchroo, Vijay K.] Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Sch Med, Ctr Neurol Dis, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Yosef, Nir; Regev, Aviv; Kuchroo, Vijay K.] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Regev, Aviv] MIT, Dept Biol, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02140 USA","Regev, A (reprint author), Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, 7 Cambridge Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",aregev@broad.mit.edu; vkuchroo@rics.bwh.harvard.edu,,"Wu, Chuan/0000-0003-2288-353X","US National Institutes of Health [NS030843, NS045937, AI073748, AI045757, 1P01HG005062-01, 1P50HG006193-01, DP1-OD003958-01, K01DK090105]; National MS Society [RG2571]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Klarman Cell Observatory; Guthy Jackson Foundation; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [J 3091-B12]","We thank D.

Although the underlying genetic basis of this class of diseases has recently been elucidated, implicating predominantly immune-response genes(1), changes in environmental factors must ultimately be driving this increase. The newly identified population of interleukin (IL)-17-producing CD4(+) helper T cells (T(H)17 cells) has a pivotal role in autoimmune diseases(2). Pathogenic IL-23-dependent T(H)17 cells have been shown to be critical for the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for multiple sclerosis, and genetic risk factors associated with multiple sclerosis are related to the IL-23-T(H)17 pathway(1,2). However, little is known about the environmental factors that directly influence T(H)17 cells. Here we show that increased salt (sodium chloride, NaCl) concentrations found locally under physiological conditions in vivo markedly boost the induction of murine and human T(H)17 cells. High-salt conditions activate the p38/MAPK pathway involving nuclear factor of activated T cells 5 (NFAT5; also called TONEBP) and serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) during cytokine-induced T(H)17 polarization. Gene silencing or chemical inhibition of p38/MAPK, NFAT5 or SGK1 abrogates the high-salt-induced T(H)17 cell development. The T(H)17 cells generated under high-salt conditions display a highly pathogenic and stable phenotype characterized by the upregulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines GM-CSF, TNF-alpha and IL-2. Moreover, mice fed with a high-salt diet develop a more severe form of EAE, in line with augmented central nervous system infiltrating and peripherally induced antigen-specific T(H)17 cells. Thus, increased dietary salt intake might represent an environmental risk factor for the development of autoimmune diseases through the induction of pathogenic T(H)17 cells.","[Kleinewietfeld, Markus; Hafler, David A.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Kleinewietfeld, Markus; Hafler, David A.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Immunobiol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Kleinewietfeld, Markus; Yosef, Nir; Hafler, David A.] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Manzel, Arndt; Linker, Ralf A.] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Dept Neurol, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany; [Manzel, Arndt] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Int Grad Sch Neurosci, D-44801 Bochum, Germany; [Titze, Jens] Vanderbilt Univ, Div Clin Pharmacol, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [Titze, Jens] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Interdisciplinary Ctr Clin Res, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany; [Titze, Jens] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Dept Hypertens & Nephrol, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany; [Kvakan, Heda; Muller, Dominik N.] Expt & Clin Res Ctr, D-13125 Berlin, Germany; [Kvakan, Heda] Helios Klinikum Berlin Buch, D-13125 Berlin, Germany; [Muller, Dominik N.] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Nikolaus Fiebiger Ctr Mol Med, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany","Kleinewietfeld, M (reprint author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, 15 York St, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",markus.kleinewietfeld@yale.edu; david.hafler@yale.edu,,,"National MS Society Collaborative Research Center [CA1061-A-18]; National Institutes of Health [P01 AI045757, U19 AI046130, U19 AI070352, P01 AI039671]; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke [NS2427]; Penates Foundation; Nancy Taylor Foundation for Chronic Diseases, Inc.; ELAN programme, University of Erlangen; German Research Foundation (DFG); German Center for Cardiovascular Research (DZHK); Interdisciplinary Center for Clinical Research at University of Erlangen; German Research Foundation","The authors would like to thank S.

Follicular T-helper cells promote proliferation and differentiation of antigen-specific B cells inside the follicle(2,3). A genetic deficiency in the inducible co-stimulator (ICOS), a classic CD28 family co-stimulatory molecule highly expressed by follicular T-helper cells, causes profound germinal centre defects(4,5), leading to the view that ICOS specifically co-stimulates the follicular T-helper cell differentiation program(2,6,7). Here we show that ICOS directly controls follicular recruitment of activated T-helper cells in mice. This effect is independent from ICOS ligand (ICOSL)-mediated co-stimulation provided by antigen-presenting dendritic cells or cognate B cells, and does not rely on Bcl6-mediated programming as an intermediate step. Instead, it requires ICOSL expression by follicular bystander B cells, which do not present cognate antigen to T-helper cells but collectively form an ICOS-engaging field. Dynamic imaging reveals ICOS engagement drives coordinated pseudopod formation and promotes persistent T-cell migration at the border between the T-cell zone and the B-cell follicle in vivo. When follicular bystander B cells cannot express ICOSL, otherwise competent T-helper cells fail to develop into follicular T-helper cells normally, and fail to promote optimal germinal centre responses. These results demonstrate a co-stimulation-independent function of ICOS, uncover a key role for bystander B cells in promoting the development of follicular T-helper cells, and reveal unsuspected sophistication in dynamic T-cell positioning in vivo.","[Xu, Heping; Li, Xuanying; Liu, Dan; Zhang, Xu; Chen, Xin; Hou, Shiyue; Peng, Lixia; Qi, Hai] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Med, Lab Dynam Immunobiol, Tsinghua Peking Ctr Life Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Li, Jianfu] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biomed Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Xu, Chenguang; Liu, Wanli] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Life Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Lianfeng] Chinese Acad Med Sci, Inst Lab Anim Sci, Minist Hlth, Key Lab Human Dis Comparat Med, Beijing 100021, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Lianfeng] Peking Union Med Coll, Comparat Med Ctr, Beijing 100021, Peoples R China","Qi, H (reprint author), Tsinghua Univ, Sch Med, Lab Dynam Immunobiol, Tsinghua Peking Ctr Life Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",qihai@biomed.tsinghua.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [81072464, 81161120405]; Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University [20091042000]; Tsinghua-Yu-Yuan Medical Sciences Fund [20240000585]; Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program [2010Z02150]; Institut Merieux; Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Sciences","H.

The World Health Organization has recommended artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria caused by the parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Artemisinin is a sesquiterpene endoperoxide with potent antimalarial properties, produced by the plant Artemisia annua. However, the supply of plant-derived artemisinin is unstable, resulting in shortages and price fluctuations, complicating production planning by ACT manufacturers(2). A stable source of affordable artemisinin is required. Here we use synthetic biology to develop strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast) for high-yielding biological production of artemisinic acid, a precursor of artemisinin. Previous attempts to produce commercially relevant concentrations of artemisinic acid were unsuccessful, allowing production of only 1.6 grams per litre of artemisinic acid(3). Here we demonstrate the complete biosynthetic pathway, including the discovery of a plant dehydrogenase and a second cytochrome that provide an efficient biosynthetic route to artemisinic acid, with fermentation titres of 25 grams per litre of artemisinic acid. Furthermore, we have developed a practical, efficient and scalable chemical process for the conversion of artemisinic acid to artemisinin using a chemical source of singlet oxygen, thus avoiding the need for specialized photochemical equipment. The strains and processes described here form the basis of a viable industrial process for the production of semi-synthetic artemisinin to stabilize the supply of artemisinin for derivatization into active pharmaceutical ingredients (for example, artesunate) for incorporation into ACTs. Because all intellectual property rights have been provided free of charge, this technology has the potential to increase provision of first-line antimalarial treatments to the developing world at a reduced average annual price.","[Paddon, C.

Proton-coupled transporters of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) are essential for phosphate uptake in plants and fungi, and also have a function in sensing external phosphate levels as transceptors(1-5). Here we report the 2.9 angstrom structure of a fungal (Piriformospora indica) high-affinity phosphate transporter, PiPT, in an inward-facing occluded state, with bound phosphate visible in the membrane-buried binding site. The structure indicates both proton and phosphate exit pathways and suggests a modified asymmetrical 'rocker-switch' mechanism of phosphate transport. PiPT is related to several human transporter families, most notably the organic cation and anion transporters of the solute carrier family (SLC22), which are implicated in cancer-drug resistance(6,7). We modelled representative cation and anion SLC22 transporters based on the PiPT structure to surmise the structural basis for substrate binding and charge selectivity in this important family. The PiPT structure demonstrates and expands on principles of substrate transport by the MFS transporters and illuminates principles of phosphate uptake in particular.","[Pedersen, Bjorn P.; Kumar, Hemant; Waight, Andrew B.; Risenmay, Aaron J.; Roe-Zurz, Zygy; Chau, Bryant H.; Harries, William; Stroud, Robert M.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem & Biophys, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Kumar, Hemant; Johri, Atul K.] Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Sch Life Sci, New Delhi 110067, India; [Schlessinger, Avner; Bonomi, Massimiliano; Sali, Andrej] Univ Calif San Francisco, Calif Inst Quantitat Biosci, Dept Pharmaceut Chem, Dept Bioengn & Therapeut Sci, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA","Stroud, RM (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem & Biophys, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA.",stroud@msg.ucsf.edu,"Pedersen, Bjorn/H-4128-2017","Pedersen, Bjorn/0000-0001-7860-7230","Carlsberg Foundation; Danish Cancer Society; Woods Whelan foundation; Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Government of India; Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi; NIH [F32 GM088991, U01 GM61390, U54 GM094625, GM24485, GM073210]","We thank K.

The modern coelacanth looks remarkably similar to many of its ancient relatives, and its evolutionary proximity to our own fish ancestors provides a glimpse of the fish that first walked on land. Here we report the genome sequence of the African coelacanth, Latimeria chalumnae. Through a phylogenomic analysis, we conclude that the lungfish, and not the coelacanth, is the closest living relative of tetrapods. Coelacanth protein-coding genes are significantly more slowly evolving than those of tetrapods, unlike other genomic features. Analyses of changes in genes and regulatory elements during the vertebrate adaptation to land highlight genes involved in immunity, nitrogen excretion and the development of fins, tail, ear, eye, brain and olfaction. Functional assays of enhancers involved in the fin-to-limb transition and in the emergence of extra-embryonic tissues show the importance of the coelacanth genome as a blueprint for understanding tetrapod evolution.","[Amemiya, Chris T.; Robinson, Mark; Saha, Nil Ratan] Benaroya Res Inst, Mol Genet Program, Seattle, WA 98101 USA; [Amemiya, Chris T.] Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98105 USA; [Alfoeldi, Jessica; MacCallum, Iain; Berlin, Aaron M.; Fan, Lin; Gnerre, Sante; Gnirke, Andreas; Johnson, Jeremy; Lara, Marcia; Levin, Joshua Z.; Mauceli, Evan; Przybylski, Dariusz; Ribeiro, Filipe J.; Sharpe, Ted; Tabbaa, Diana; Turner-Maier, Jason; Williams, Louise; Jaffe, David B.; Di Palma, Federica; Lander, Eric S.; Lindblad-Toh, Kerstin] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Lee, Alison P.; Ravi, Vydianathan; Venkatesh, Byrappa] ASTAR, Inst Mol & Cell Biol, Comparat Genom Lab, Singapore 138673, Singapore; [Fan, Shaohua; Manousaki, Tereza; Feiner, Nathalie; Kuraku, Shigehiro; Simakov, Oleg; Meyer, Axel] Univ Konstanz, Dept Biol, D-78464 Constance, Germany; [Philippe, Herve; Brinkmann, Henner] Univ Montreal, Ctr Robert Cedergren, Dept Biochim, Montreal, PQ H3T 1J4, Canada; [Braasch, Ingo; Postlethwait, John H.] Univ Oregon, Inst Neurosci, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Manousaki, Tereza; Meyer, Axel] Univ Konstanz, Konstanz Res Sch Chem Biol, D-78464 Constance, Germany; [Schneider, Igor] Fed Univ Para, Inst Ciencias Biol, BR-66075110 Belem, Para, Brazil; [Rohner, Nicolas; Tabin, Clifford J.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Organ, Chris] Univ Utah, Dept Anthropol, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Chalopin, Domitille; Volff, Jean-Nicolas] Ecole Normale Super Lyon, Inst Genom Fonct Lyon, F-69007 Lyon, France; [Smith, Jeramiah J.] Univ Kentucky, Dept Biol, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; [Dorrington, Rosemary A.; Blatch, Gregory L.; Edkins, Adrienne L.] Rhodes Univ, Dept Biochem Microbiol & Biotechnol, Biomed Biotechnol Res Unit BioBRU, ZA-6139 Grahamstown, South Africa; [Gerdol, Marco; De Moro, Gianluca; Pallavicini, Alberto] Univ Trieste, Dept Life Sci, I-34128 Trieste, Italy; [Aken, Bronwen; Searle, Stephen M.

The crystal structure of TrkH from Vibrio parahaemolyticus showed that TrkH resembles a K+ channel and may have a gating mechanism substantially different from K+ channels. TrkH assembles with TrkA, a cytosolic protein comprising two RCK (regulate the conductance of K+) domains, which are found in certain K+ channels and control their gating. However, fundamental questions on whether TrkH is an ion channel and how it is regulated by TrkA remain unresolved. Here we show single-channel activity of TrkH that is upregulated by ATP via TrkA. We report two structures of the tetrameric TrkA ring, one in complex with TrkH and one in isolation, in which the ring assumes two markedly different conformations.

These ion transporters are functionally diverse: they can function as Na+ or K+ channels and possibly as cation/K+ symporters. They are closely related to potassium channels both at the level of the membrane protein and at the level of the cytosolic regulatory domains. Here we describe the crystal structure of a Ktr K+ transporter, the KtrAB complex from Bacillus subtilis. The structure shows the dimeric membrane protein KtrB assembled with a cytosolic octameric KtrA ring bound to ATP, an activating ligand. A comparison between the structure of KtrAB-ATP and the structures of the isolated full-length KtrA protein with ATP or ADP reveals a ligand-dependent conformational change in the octameric ring, raising new ideas about the mechanism of activation in these transporters.","[Vieira-Pires, Ricardo S.; Szollosi, Andras; Morais-Cabral, Joao H.] Univ Porto, IBMC, P-4150180 Oporto, Portugal","Morais-Cabral, JH (reprint author), Univ Porto, IBMC, Rua Campo Alegre 823, P-4150180 Oporto, Portugal.",jcabral@ibmc.up.pt,"Morais-Cabral, Joao/J-4914-2013; Szollosi, Andras/J-5097-2013; Vieira-Pires, Ricardo/J-5232-2013","Morais-Cabral, Joao/0000-0002-4461-9716; Vieira-Pires, Ricardo/0000-0003-1830-3715; Szollosi, Andras/0000-0002-5570-4609","FEBS; EMBO; FEDER funds through the Operational Competitiveness Program-COMPETE; FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [FCOMP-01-0124-FEDER-022718 (PEst-C/SAU/LA0002/2011), FCOMP-01-0124-FEDER-009028 (PTDC/BIA-PRO/099861/2008) FCOMP-01-0124-FEDER-010781 (PTDC/QUI-BIQ/105342/2008)]","We are grateful for access to ID14-1/ID14-4/ID-29 at ESRF (through the Portuguese BAG), PXII at SLS, XRD1 at ELETTRA and PROXIMA1 at SOLEIL and thank the respective support staff.

However, it remains unknown how soon after the Big Bang massive starburst progenitors exist. The measured redshift (z) distribution of dusty, massive starbursts has long been suspected to be biased low in z owing to selection effects(1), as confirmed by recent findings of systems with redshifts as high as similar to 5 (refs 2-4). Here we report the identification of a massive starburst galaxy at z = 6.34 through a submillimetre colour-selection technique. We unambiguously determined the redshift from a suite of molecular and atomic fine-structure cooling lines. These measurements reveal a hundred billion solar masses of highly excited, chemically evolved interstellar medium in this galaxy, which constitutes at least 40 per cent of the baryonic mass. A 'maximum starburst' converts the gas into stars at a rate more than 2,000 times that of the Milky Way, a rate among the highest observed at any epoch. Despite the overall downturn in cosmic star formation towards the highest redshifts(5), it seems that environments mature enough to form the most massive, intense starbursts existed at least as early as 880 million years after the Big Bang.","[Riechers, Dominik A.; Bradford, C.

Fundamentally, it is possible because of the extreme isolation of nuclear spins from their environment. This isolation also makes single nuclear spins desirable for quantum-information processing, as shown by pioneering studies on nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond(1-4). The nuclear spin of a P-31 donor in silicon is very promising as a quantum bit(5): bulk measurements indicate that it has excellent coherence times(6,7) and silicon is the dominant material in the microelectronics industry. Here we demonstrate electrical detection and coherent manipulation of a single P-31 nuclear spin qubit with sufficiently high fidelities for fault-tolerant quantum computing(8). By integrating single-shot readout of the electron spin(9) with on-chip electron spin resonance(10), we demonstrate quantum non-demolition(11) and electrical single-shot readout of the nuclear spin with a readout fidelity higher than 99.8 per cent-the highest so far reported for any solid-state qubit. The single nuclear spin is then operated as a qubit by applying coherent radio-frequency pulses. For an ionized P-31 donor, we find a nuclear spin coherence time of 60 milliseconds and a one-qubit gate control fidelity exceeding 98 per cent. These results demonstrate that the dominant technology of modern electronics can be adapted to host a complete electrical measurement and control platform for nuclear-spin-based quantum-information processing.","[Pla, Jarryd J.; Tan, Kuan Y.; Dehollain, Juan P.; Lim, Wee H.; Zwanenburg, Floris A.; Dzurak, Andrew S.; Morello, Andrea] Univ New S Wales, Sch Elect Engn & Telecommun, Ctr Quantum Computat & Commun Technol, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Morton, John J.

Understanding the fundamental science of strain-stiffening and incorporating this concept into the design of metals and ceramics for advanced applications is an attractive prospect. Using cementite (Fe3C) and aluminium borocarbide (Al3BC3) as prototypes, here we show via quantum-mechanical calculations that strain-stiffening also occurs, surprisingly, in simple inorganic crystalline solids and confers exceptionally high strengths to these two solids, which have anomalously low resistance to deformation near equilibrium. For Fe3C and Al3BC3, their ideal shear strength to shear modulus ratios attain remarkably high values of 1.14 and 1.34 along the (010)[ 001] and (0001) [01 (1) over bar0] slip systems, respectively. These values are more than seven times larger than the original Frenkel value of 1/2 pi (refs 4, 5) and are the highest yet reported for crystalline solids. The extraordinary stiffening of Fe3C arises from the strain-induced reversible 'cross-linking' between weakly coupled edge- and corner-sharing Fe6C slabs. This new bond formation creates a strong, three-dimensional covalent bond network that resists large shear deformation. Unlike Fe3C, no new bond forms in Al3BC3 but stiffening still occurs because strong repulsion between Al and B in a compressed Al-B bond unsettles the existing covalent bond network. These discoveries challenge the conventional wisdom that large shear modulus is a reliable predictor of hardness and strength of materials(4-7), and provide new lessons for materials selection and design.","[Jiang, Chao] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Struct Property Relat Grp MST 8, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA; [Srinivasan, Srivilliputhur G.] Univ N Texas, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Denton, TX 76203 USA","Jiang, C (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, 1509 Univ Ave, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",chaopsu@gmail.com; srinivasan.srivilliputhur@unt.edu,"Jiang, Chao/D-1957-2017","Jiang, Chao/0000-0003-0610-6327",Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL); National Science Foundation [0846444],"C.J. acknowledges the support of a Director's Fellowship at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), where a systematic study of cementite was conceived and initiated.

However, it is challenging to apply these methods to organic materials, which have weak scattering centres, thermal lability, and poor heat conduction. These characteristics mean that the source needs to be extremely bright to enable us to obtain high-quality diffraction data before cumulative heating effects from the laser excitation either degrade the sample or mask the structural dynamics(20). Here we show that a recently developed, ultrabright femtosecond electron source(7-9) makes it possible to monitor the molecular motions in the organic salt (EDO-TTF)(2)PF6 as it undergoes its photo-induced insulator-to-metal phase transition(21-24). After the ultrafast laser excitation, we record time-delayed diffraction patterns that allow us to identify hundreds of Bragg reflections with which to map the structural evolution of the system. The data and supporting model calculations indicate the formation of a transient intermediate structure in the early stage of charge delocalization (less than five picoseconds), and reveal that the molecular motions driving its formation are distinct from those that, assisted by thermal relaxation, convert the system into a metallic state on the hundred-picosecond timescale. These findings establish the potential of ultrabright femtosecond electron sources(7-14) for probing the primary processes governing structural dynamics with atomic resolution in labile systems relevant to chemistry and biology.","[Gao, Meng; Lu, Cheng; Jean-Ruel, Hubert; Liu, Lai Chung; Cooney, Ryan R.; Moriena, Gustavo; Sciaini, German; Miller, R.

Global-scale estimates of transpiration from climate models are poorly constrained owing to large uncertainties in stomatal conductance and the lack of catchment-scale measurements required for model calibration, resulting in a range of predictions spanning 20 to 65 per cent of total terrestrial evapotranspiration (14,000 to 41,000 km(3) per year) (refs 1-5). Here we use the distinct isotope effects of transpiration and evaporation to show that transpiration is by far the largest water flux from Earth's continents, representing 80 to 90 per cent of terrestrial evapotranspiration. On the basis of our analysis of a global data set of large lakes and rivers, we conclude that transpiration recycles 62,000 +/- 8,000 km(3) of water per year to the atmosphere, using half of all solar energy absorbed by land surfaces in the process. We also calculate CO2 uptake by terrestrial vegetation by connecting transpiration losses to carbon assimilation using water-use efficiency ratios of plants, and show the global gross primary productivity to be 129 +/- 32 gigatonnes of carbon per year, which agrees, within the uncertainty, with previous estimates(6). The dominance of transpiration water fluxes in continental evapotranspiration suggests that, from the point of view of water resource forecasting, climate model development should prioritize improvements in simulations of biological fluxes rather than physical (evaporation) fluxes.","[Jasechko, Scott; Sharp, Zachary D.; Fawcett, Peter J.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Gibson, John J.; Birks, S.

Ceramic container technologies were one of a range of late glacial adaptations that were pivotal to structuring subsequent cultural trajectories in different regions of the world, but the reasons for their emergence and widespread uptake are poorly understood. The first ceramic containers must have provided prehistoric hunter-gatherers with attractive new strategies for processing and consuming foodstuffs, but virtually nothing is known of how early pots were used. Here we report the chemical analysis of food residues associated with Late Pleistocene pottery, focusing on one of the best-studied prehistoric ceramic sequences in the world, the Japanese Jomon. We demonstrate that lipids can be recovered reliably from charred surface deposits adhering to pottery dating from about 15,000 to 11,800 cal BP (the Incipient Jomon period), the oldest pottery so far investigated, and that in most cases these organic compounds are unequivocally derived from processing freshwater and marine organisms. Stable isotope data support the lipid evidence and suggest that most of the 101 charred deposits analysed, from across the major islands of Japan, were derived from high-trophic-level aquatic food. Productive aquatic ecotones were heavily exploited by late glacial foragers(3), perhaps providing an initial impetus for investment in ceramic container technology, and paving the way for further intensification of pottery use by hunter-gatherers in the early Holocene epoch. Now that we have shown that it is possible to analyse organic residues from some of the world's earliest ceramic vessels, the subsequent development of this critical technology can be clarified through further widespread testing of hunter-gatherer pottery from later periods.","[Craig, O.

Recent studies of populations in the field and in the laboratory have used time-series data to confirm some of the theoretically predicted early warning indicators, such as an increase in recovery time or in the size and timescale of fluctuations(3-6). However, the predictive power of temporal warning signals is limited by the demand for long-term observations. Large-scale spatial data are more accessible, but the performance of warning signals in spatially extended systems(7-10) needs to be examined empirically(3,11-13). Here we use spatially extended yeast populations, an experimental system with a fold bifurcation (tipping point)(6), to evaluate early warning signals based on spatio-temporal fluctuations and to identify a novel spatial warning indicator. We found that two leading indicators based on fluctuations increased before collapse of connected populations; however, the magnitudes of the increases were smaller than those observed in isolated populations, possibly because local variation is reduced by dispersal. Furthermore, we propose a generic indicator based on deterministic spatial patterns, which we call 'recovery length'. As the spatial counterpart of recovery time(14), recovery length is the distance necessary for connected populations to recover from spatial perturbations. In our experiments, recovery length increased substantially before population collapse, suggesting that the spatial scale of recovery can provide a superior warning signal before tipping points in spatially extended systems.","[Dai, Lei; Korolev, Kirill S.; Gore, Jeff] MIT, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Dai, L (reprint author), MIT, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",dailei@mit.edu; gore@mit.edu,,,"Whitaker Health Sciences Fund Fellowship; Pappalardo Fellowship; NIH [NIH R00 GM085279-02, NIH DP2]; NSF CAREER Award; Sloan Research Fellowship; Pew Scholars Program; Allen Investigator Program","We would like to thank D.

Human studies have suggested that deficits in prefrontal cortical function and consequential loss of inhibitory control(2-4) could be crucial in promoting compulsive drug use. However, it remains unknown whether chronic drug use compromises cortical activity and, equally important, whether this deficit promotes compulsive cocaine seeking. Here we use a rat model of compulsive drug seeking(5-8) in which cocaine seeking persists in a subgroup of rats despite delivery of noxious foot shocks. We show that prolonged cocaine self-administration decreases ex vivo intrinsic excitability of deep-layer pyramidal neurons in the prelimbic cortex, which was significantly more pronounced in compulsive drug-seeking animals. Furthermore, compensating for hypoactive prelimbic cortex neurons with in vivo optogenetic prelimbic cortex stimulation significantly prevented compulsive cocaine seeking, whereas optogenetic prelimbic cortex inhibition significantly increased compulsive cocaine seeking. Our results show a marked reduction in prelimbic cortex excitability in compulsive cocaine-seeking rats, and that in vivo optogenetic prelimbic cortex stimulation decreased compulsive drug-seeking behaviours. Thus, targeted stimulation of the prefrontal cortex could serve as a promising therapy for treating compulsive drug use.","[Chen, Billy T.; Yau, Hau-Jie; Hatch, Christina; Kusumoto-Yoshida, Ikue; Bonci, Antonello] NIDA, Intramural Res Program, Baltimore, MD 21224 USA; [Cho, Saemi L.; Hopf, F.

Retinoic acid (RA) is an important morphogen involved in patterning the anterior-posterior axis of structures, including the hindbrain(1-6) and paraxial mesoderm(7,8). RA diffuses over long distances, and its activity is spatially restricted by synthesizing and degrading enzymes(9). However, gradients of endogenous morphogens in live embryos have not been directly observed; indeed, their existence, distribution and requirement for correct patterning remain controversial(10). Here we report a family of genetically encoded indicators for RA that we have termed GEPRAs (genetically encoded probes for RA). Using the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer we engineered the ligand-binding domains of RA receptors to incorporate cyan-emitting and yellow-emitting fluorescent proteins as fluorescence resonance energy transfer donor and acceptor, respectively, for the reliable detection of ambient free RA. We created three GEPRAs with different affinities for RA, enabling the quantitative measurement of physiological RA concentrations. Live imaging of zebrafish embryos at the gastrula and somitogenesis stages revealed a linear concentration gradient of endogenous RA in a two-tailed source-sink arrangement across the embryo. Modelling of the observed linear RA gradient suggests that the rate of RA diffusion exceeds the spatiotemporal dynamics of embryogenesis, resulting in stability to perturbation. Furthermore, we used GEPRAs in combination with genetic and pharmacological perturbations to resolve competing hypotheses on the structure of the RA gradient during hindbrain formation and somitogenesis. Live imaging of endogenous concentration gradients across embryonic development will allow the precise assignment of molecular mechanisms to developmental dynamics and will accelerate the application of approaches based on morphogen gradients to tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.","[Shimozono, Satoshi; Iimura, Tadahiro; Miyawaki, Atsushi] RIKEN, Brain Sci Inst, Lab Cell Funct Dynam, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Kitaguchi, Tetsuya; Miyawaki, Atsushi] JST, ERATO, Life Funct & Dynam, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Higashijima, Shin-ichi] Natl Inst Nat Sci, Okazaki Inst Integrat Biosci, Natl Inst Physiol Sci, Okazaki, Aichi 4448787, Japan","Miyawaki, A (reprint author), RIKEN, Brain Sci Inst, Lab Cell Funct Dynam, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan.",matsushi@brain.riken.jp,"Miyawaki, Atsushi/K-3569-2014; Kitaguchi, Tetsuya/F-5260-2017","Miyawaki, Atsushi/0000-0002-2329-3235; Higashijima, Shin-ichi/0000-0001-6350-4992; Iimura, Tadahiro/0000-0002-1431-0689","Japan Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology; Human Frontier Science Program","The authors thank Y.

Among those lacking an envelope, the Picornaviridae are a large and diverse family of positive-strand RNA viruses that includes hepatitis A virus (HAV), an ancient human pathogen that remains a common cause of enterically transmitted hepatitis(2-4). HAV infects in a stealth-like manner and replicates efficiently in the liver(5). Virus-specific antibodies appear only after 3-4 weeks of infection, and typically herald its resolution(3,4). Although unexplained mechanistically, both anti-HAV antibody and inactivated whole-virus vaccines prevent disease when administered as late as 2 weeks after exposure(6), when virus replication is well established in the liver(5). Here we show that HAV released from cells is cloaked in host-derived membranes, thereby protecting the virion from antibody-mediated neutralization. These enveloped viruses ('eHAV') resemble exosomes(7), small vesicles that are increasingly recognized to be important in intercellular communications. They are fully infectious, sensitive to extraction with chloroform, and circulate in the blood of infected humans. Their biogenesis is dependent on host proteins associated with endosomal-sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT)(8), namely VPS4B and ALIX. Whereas the hijacking of membranes by HAV facilitates escape from neutralizing antibodies and probably promotes virus spread within the liver, anti-capsid antibodies restrict replication after infection with eHAV, suggesting a possible explanation for prophylaxis after exposure. Membrane hijacking by HAV blurs the classic distinction between 'enveloped' and 'non-enveloped' viruses and has broad implications for mechanisms of viral egress from infected cells as well as host immune responses.","[Feng, Zongdi; Hensley, Lucinda; McKnight, Kevin L.; Hu, Fengyu; Ping, LiFang; Lemon, Stanley M.] Univ N Carolina, Lineberger Comprehens Canc Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Madden, Victoria] Univ N Carolina, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Jeong, Sook-Hyang] Seoul Natl Univ, Bundang Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Songnam 463707, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Walker, Christopher] Nationwide Childrens Hosp, Res Inst, Ctr Vaccines & Immun, Columbus, OH 43205 USA; [Walker, Christopher] Ohio State Univ, Dept Pediat, Coll Med, Columbus, OH 43205 USA; [Lanford, Robert E.] Texas Biomed Res Inst, Dept Virol & Immunol, San Antonio, TX 78227 USA; [Lemon, Stanley M.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Med, Div Infect Dis, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Lemon, Stanley M.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA","Lemon, SM (reprint author), Univ N Carolina, Lineberger Comprehens Canc Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",smlemon@med.unc.edu,,"Feng, Zongdi/0000-0001-7913-1027",National Institutes of Health [R01-AI103083]; University Cancer Research Fund,We thank M.

Whereas PARKIN is recruited to the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) upon depolarization via PINK1 action and can ubiquitylate porin, mitofusin and Miro proteins on the MOM1,4-11, the full repertoire of PARKIN substrates-the PARKIN-dependent ubiquitylome-remains poorly defined. Here we use quantitative diGly capture proteomics (diGly)(12,13) to elucidate the ubiquitylation site specificity and topology of PARKIN-dependent target modification in response to mitochondrial depolarization. Hundreds of dynamically regulated ubiquitylation sites in dozens of proteins were identified, with strong enrichment for MOM proteins, indicating that PARKIN dramatically alters the ubiquitylation status of the mitochondrial proteome. Using complementary interaction proteomics, we found depolarization-dependent PARKIN association with numerous MOM targets, autophagy receptors, and the proteasome. Mutation of the PARKIN active site residue C431, which has been found mutated in Parkinson's disease patients, largely disrupts these associations. Structural and topological analysis revealed extensive conservation of PARKIN-dependent ubiquitylation sites on cytoplasmic domains in vertebrate and Drosophila melanogaster MOM proteins. These studies provide a resource for understanding how the PINK1-PARKIN pathway re-sculpts the proteome to support mitochondrial homeostasis.","[Sarraf, Shireen A.; Raman, Malavika; Guarani-Pereira, Virginia; Sowa, Mathew E.; Huttlin, Edward L.; Gygi, Steven P.; Harper, J.

Central to heterochromatin spread is heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), which recognizes H3K9-methylated chromatin, oligomerizes and forms a versatile platform that participates in diverse nuclear functions, ranging from gene silencing to chromosome segregation(1-6). How HP1 proteins assemble on methylated nucleosomal templates and how the HP1-nucleosome complex achieves functional versatility remain poorly understood. Here we show that binding of the key S. pombe HP1 protein, Swi6, to methylated nucleosomes drives a switch from an auto-inhibited state to a spreading-competent state. In the auto-inhibited state, a histonemimic sequence in one Swi6 monomer blocks methyl-mark recognition by the chromodomain of another monomer. Auto-inhibition is relieved by recognition of two template features, the H3K9 methyl mark and nucleosomal DNA. Cryo-electron-microscopy-based reconstruction of the Swi6-nucleosome complex provides the overall architecture of the spreading-competent state in which two unbound chromodomain sticky ends appear exposed.

KMO is a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent monooxygenase and is located in the outer mitochondrial membrane where it converts L-kynurenine to 3-hydroxykynurenine. Perturbations in the levels of kynurenine pathway metabolites have been linked to the pathogenesis of a spectrum of brain disorders(6), as well as cancer(7,8) and several peripheral inflammatory conditions(9). Despite the importance of KMO as a target for neurodegenerative disease, the molecular basis of KMO inhibition by available lead compounds has remained unknown. Here we report the first crystal structure of Saccharomyces cerevisiae KMO, in the free form and in complex with the tight-binding inhibitor UPF 648. UPF 648 binds close to the FAD cofactor and perturbs the local active-site structure, preventing productive binding of the substrate L-kynurenine. Functional assays and targeted mutagenesis reveal that the active-site architecture and UPF 648 binding are essentially identical in human KMO, validating the yeast KMO-UPF 648 structure as a template for structure-based drug design. This will inform the search for new KMO inhibitors that are able to cross the blood-brain barrier in targeted therapies against neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.","[Amaral, Marta; Levy, Colin; Heyes, Derren J.; Leys, David; Scrutton, Nigel S.] Univ Manchester, Manchester Inst Biotechnol, Manchester M1 7DN, Lancs, England; [Amaral, Marta; Giorgini, Flaviano] Univ Leicester, Dept Genet, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; [Amaral, Marta; Outeiro, Tiago F.] Inst Mol Med, Cell & Mol Neurosci Unit, P-1659028 Lisbon, Portugal; [Amaral, Marta; Outeiro, Tiago F.] Univ Lisbon, Fac Med, Inst Fisiol, P-1649028 Lisbon, Portugal; [Lafite, Pierre] Univ Orleans, Inst Chim Organ & Analyt, CNRS, UMR7311, F-45067 Orleans 2, France; [Outeiro, Tiago F.] Univ Med Ctr Gottingen, Ctr Nanoscale Microscopy & Mol Physiol Brain, Dept Neurodegenerat & Restorat Res, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany","Scrutton, NS (reprint author), Univ Manchester, Manchester Inst Biotechnol, 131 Princess St, Manchester M1 7DN, Lancs, England.",nigel.scrutton@manchester.ac.uk,"Lafite, Pierre/F-6806-2011; Outeiro, Tiago/C-1067-2008","Lafite, Pierre/0000-0003-1637-4966; Outeiro, Tiago/0000-0003-1679-1727; Heyes, Derren/0000-0002-7453-1571",Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/D01963X/1],,,40,47,49,3,86,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,18-Apr,2013,496,7445,,,,,382,+,,10.1038/nature12039,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,126FV,WOS:000317599200042,23575632.0,No,,,11/20/17,nigel s.,scrutton,na,na,na,na,na

Combining chemical manipulations and chemical genetics at the photoautotrophic transition checkpoint, we reveal that shoot photosynthesis-derived glucose drives target-of-rapamycin (TOR) signalling relays through glycolysis and mitochondrial bioenergetics to control root meristem activation, which is decoupled from direct glucose sensing, growth-hormone signalling and stem-cell maintenance. Surprisingly, glucose-TOR signalling dictates transcriptional reprogramming of remarkable gene sets involved in central and secondary metabolism, cell cycle, transcription, signalling, transport and protein folding. Systems, cellular and genetic analyses uncover TOR phosphorylation of E2Fa transcription factor for an unconventional activation of S-phase genes, and glucose-signalling defects in e2fa root meristems. Our findings establish pivotal roles of glucose-TOR signalling in unprecedented transcriptional networks wiring central metabolism and biosynthesis for energy and biomass production, and integrating localized stem/progenitor-cell proliferation through inter-organ nutrient coordination to control developmental transition and growth.","[Xiong, Yan; McCormack, Matthew; Li, Lei; Hall, Qi; Sheen, Jen] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Mol Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Xiong, Yan; McCormack, Matthew; Li, Lei; Hall, Qi; Sheen, Jen] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Computat & Integrat Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Xiong, Yan; McCormack, Matthew; Li, Lei; Hall, Qi; Sheen, Jen] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Xiang, Chengbin] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Life Sci, Hefei 230023, Peoples R China","Xiong, Y (reprint author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Mol Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",xiong@molbio.mgh.harvard.edu; sheen@molbio.mgh.harvard.edu,"Li, Lei/F-9826-2015",,MGH Tosteson Postdoctoral Fellowship; Chinese Academy of Sciences [KSCX3-YW-N-007]; NSF; NIH; WJC Special Project RDA-Korea [PJ009106],"We thank N.

At low latitudes the solar radiation should result in a weak planet-wide glow in the infrared, corresponding to the planet's uniform illumination by the Sun(2). The observed electron density of the low-latitude ionosphere, however, is lower and its temperature higher than predicted by models(3-5). A planet-to-ring magnetic connection has been previously suggested, in which an influx of water from the rings could explain the lower-than-expected electron densities in Saturn's atmosphere(6-8). Here we report the detection of a pattern of features, extending across a broad latitude band from 25 to 60 degrees, that is superposed on the lower-latitude background glow, with peaks in emission that map along the planet's magnetic field lines to gaps in Saturn's rings. This pattern implies the transfer of charged species derived from water from the ring-plane to the ionosphere, an influx on a global scale, flooding between 30 to 43 per cent of the surface of Saturn's upper atmosphere. This ring 'rain' is important in modulating ionospheric emissions and suppressing electron densities.","[O'Donoghue, J.; Stallard, T. S.; Melin, H.; Cowley, S. W. H.; Blake, J. S.

In two dimensions, electrons on the surface of a topological insulator are not scattered despite defects and disorder, providing robustness akin to that of superconductors. Topological insulators are predicted to have wide-ranging applications in fault-tolerant quantum computing and spintronics. Substantial effort has been directed towards realizing topological insulators for electromagnetic waves(4-13). One-dimensional systems with topological edge states have been demonstrated, but these states are zero-dimensional and therefore exhibit no transport properties(11,12,14). Topological protection of microwaves has been observed using a mechanism similar to the quantum Hall effect(15), by placing a gyromagnetic photonic crystal in an external magnetic field(5). But because magnetic effects are very weak at optical frequencies, realizing photonic topological insulators with scatter-free edge states requires a fundamentally different mechanism-one that is free of magnetic fields. A number of proposals for photonic topological transport have been put forward recently(6-10). One suggested temporal modulation of a photonic crystal, thus breaking time-reversal symmetry and inducing one-way edge states(10). This is in the spirit of the proposed Floquet topological insulators(16-19), in which temporal variations in solid-state systems induce topological edge states. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate a photonic topological insulator free of external fields and with scatter-free edge transport-a photonic lattice exhibiting topologically protected transport of visible light on the lattice edges. Our system is composed of an array of evanescently coupled helical waveguides(20) arranged in a graphene-like honeycomblattice(21-26). Paraxial diffraction of light is described by a Schrodinger equation where the propagation coordinate (z) acts as 'time'(27). Thus the helicity of the waveguides breaks z-reversal symmetry as proposed for Floquet topological insulators. This structure results in one-way edge states that are topologically protected from scattering.","[Rechtsman, Mikael C.; Plotnik, Yonatan; Lumer, Yaakov; Podolsky, Daniel; Segev, Mordechai] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Dept Phys, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel; [Rechtsman, Mikael C.; Plotnik, Yonatan; Lumer, Yaakov; Podolsky, Daniel; Segev, Mordechai] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Inst Solid State, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel; [Zeuner, Julia M.; Dreisow, Felix; Nolte, Stefan; Szameit, Alexander] Univ Jena, Abbe Ctr Photon, Inst Appl Phys, D-07743 Jena, Germany","Rechtsman, MC (reprint author), Technion Israel Inst Technol, Dept Phys, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel.",mcrworld@gmail.com; yonatanplotnik@gmail.com,"Rechtsman, Mikael/L-8926-2013; Nolte, Stefan/R-6574-2016","Szameit, Alexander/0000-0003-0071-6941","Azrieli Foundation; Israel Science Foundation; USA-Israel Binational Science Foundation; European Research Council; German Ministry of Education and Research (Center for Innovation Competence program) [03Z1HN31]; Thuringian Ministry for Education, Science and Culture (Research group Spacetime) [11027-514]","M.C.R. is grateful to the Azrieli Foundation for the Azrieli fellowship while at the Technion.

Previous reconstructions of past temperature variability have demonstrated that recent warmth is anomalous relative to preceding centuries(2,8,9) or millennia(10), but extreme events can be more thoroughly evaluated using a spatially resolved approach that provides an ensemble of possible temperature histories(11,12). Here, using a hierarchical Bayesian analysis(13,14) of instrumental, tree-ring, ice-core and lake-sediment records, we show that the magnitude and frequency of recent warm temperature extremes at high northern latitudes are unprecedented in the past 600 years. The summers of 2005, 2007, 2010 and 2011 were warmer than those of all prior years back to 1400 (probability P > 0.95), in terms of the spatial average. The summer of 2010 was the warmest in the previous 600 years in western Russia (P > 0.99) and probably the warmest in western Greenland and the Canadian Arctic as well (P > 0.90). These and other recent extremes greatly exceed those expected from a stationary climate, but can be understood as resulting from constant space-time variability about an increased mean temperature.","[Tingley, Martin P.; Huybers, Peter] Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Tingley, MP (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, 20 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",tingley@fas.harvard.edu,,,FAS Science Division Research Computing Group at Harvard University; NSF [ATM-0902374],"Data analysis was performed on the Odyssey cluster supported by the FAS Science Division Research Computing Group at Harvard University.

Although it has long been expected that river incision rates should depend strongly on precipitation rates, quantifying the effects of precipitation rates on bedrock river incision rates has proved difficult, partly because river incision rates are difficult to measure and partly because non-climatic factors can obscure climatic effects at sites where river incision rates have been measured(8,9). Here we present measurements of river incision rates across one of Earth's steepest rainfall gradients, which show that precipitation rates do indeed influence long-term bedrock river incision rates. We apply a widely used empirical law for bedrock river incision(3,9-11) to a series of rivers on the Hawaiian island of Kaua'i, where mean annual precipitation ranges from 0.5 metres to 9.5 metres (ref. 12)-over 70 per cent of the global range(13)-and river incision rates averaged over millions of years can be inferred from the depth of river canyons and the age of the volcanic bedrock. Both a time-averaged analysis and numerical modelling of transient river incision reveal that the long-term efficiency of bedrock river incision across Kaua'i is positively correlated with upstream-averaged mean annual precipitation rates. We provide theoretical context for this result by demonstrating that our measurements are consistent with a linear dependence of river incision rates on stream power, the rate of energy expenditure by the flow on the riverbed. These observations provide rare empirical evidence for the long-proposed coupling between climate and river incision, suggesting that previously proposed feed-backs among topography, climate and tectonics may occur.","[Ferrier, Ken L.; Huppert, Kimberly L.; Perron, J.

Notable exceptions are the oldest known embryos from the Early Jurassic South African sauropodomorph Massospondylus(3,4) and Late Jurassic embryos of a theropod from Portugal(5). The fact that dinosaur embryos are rare and typically enclosed in eggshells limits their availability for tissue and cellular level investigations of development. Consequently, little is known about growth patterns in dinosaur embryos, even though post-hatching ontogeny has been studied in several taxa(6). Here we report the discovery of an embryonic dinosaur bone bed from the Lower Jurassic of China, the oldest such occurrence in the fossil record. The embryos are similar in geological age to those of Massospondylus and are also assignable to a sauropodomorph dinosaur, probably Lufengosaurus(7). The preservation of numerous disarticulated skeletal elements and eggshells in this monotaxic bone bed, representing different stages of incubation and therefore derived from different nests, provides opportunities for new investigations of dinosaur embryology in a clade noted for gigantism. For example, comparisons among embryonic femora of different sizes and developmental stages reveal a consistently rapid rate of growth throughout development, possibly indicating that short incubation times were characteristic of sauropodomorphs. In addition, asymmetric radial growth of the femoral shaft and rapid expansion of the fourth trochanter suggest that embryonic muscle activation played an important role in the pre-hatching ontogeny of these dinosaurs. This discovery also provides the oldest evidence of in situ preservation of complex organic remains in a terrestrial vertebrate.","[Reisz, Robert R.; LeBlanc, Aaron R.

Single-cell genomic sequencing of one cell of MCG and three cells of MBG-D indicated that they form new branches basal to the archaeal phyla Thaumarchaeota(3) and Aigarchaeota(4), for MCG, and the order Thermoplasmatales, for MBG-D. All four cells encoded extracellular protein-degrading enzymes such as gingipain and clostripain that are known to be effective in environments chemically similar to marine sediments. Furthermore, we found these two types of peptidase to be abundant and active in marine sediments, indicating that uncultured archaea may have a previously undiscovered role in protein remineralization in anoxic marine sediments.","[Lloyd, Karen G.; Schreiber, Lars; Petersen, Dorthe G.; Kjeldsen, Kasper U.; Lever, Mark A.; Schramm, Andreas; Jorgensen, Bo Barker] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Ctr Geomicrobiol, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark; [Lloyd, Karen G.; Steen, Andrew D.] Univ Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Stepanauskas, Ramunas] Bigelow Lab Ocean Sci, East Boothbay, ME 04544 USA; [Richter, Michael] Ribocon GmbH, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Kleindienst, Sara; Lenk, Sabine] Max Planck Inst Marine Microbiol, D-28359 Bremen, Germany","Lloyd, KG (reprint author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Ctr Geomicrobiol, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark.",klloyd@utk.edu,"; Petersen, Dorthe/B-6063-2009; Lever, Mark/C-2134-2011; Schramm, Andreas/J-2655-2013; Schreiber, Lars/J-5937-2013; Jorgensen, Bo/C-2214-2013; Kjeldsen, Kasper/A-4151-2011; Kleindienst, Sara/O-9908-2016","Stepanauskas, Ramunas/0000-0003-4458-3108; Lever, Mark/0000-0002-2046-8028; Schramm, Andreas/0000-0002-7614-9616; Schreiber, Lars/0000-0003-3411-0083; Jorgensen, Bo/0000-0001-9398-8027; Kjeldsen, Kasper/0000-0002-7805-5605; Kleindienst, Sara/0000-0001-8304-9149; Lloyd, Karen/0000-0003-0914-6375; Steen, Andrew/0000-0003-4297-4332","Danish National Research Foundation; German Max Planck Society; NSF Center for Dark Energy Biosphere Investigations [NSF-157595]; Danish Council for Independent Research-Natural Sciences; Villum Kann Rasmussen Foundation; EU Marie Curie fellowship; German Research Foundation; USA National Science Foundation [EF-826924, OCE-821374, OCE-1019242]","The authors thank the captain and crew of the R/V Tyra for sampling; T.

Here we investigate if and how defined neural projections arising from a single coordinating brain region in mice could mediate diverse features of anxiety. Integrating behavioural assays, in vivo and in vitro electrophysiology, respiratory physiology and optogenetics, we identify a surprising new role for the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) in the coordinated modulation of diverse anxiety features. First, two BNST subregions were unexpectedly found to exert opposite effects on the anxious state: oval BNST activity promoted several independent anxious state features, whereas anterodorsal BNST-associated activity exerted anxiolytic influence for the same features. Notably, we found that three distinct anterodorsal BNST efferent projections-to the lateral hypothalamus, parabrachial nucleus and ventral tegmental area-each implemented an independent feature of anxiolysis: reduced risk-avoidance, reduced respiratory rate, and increased positive valence, respectively. Furthermore, selective inhibition of corresponding circuit elements in freely moving mice showed opposing behavioural effects compared with excitation, and in vivo recordings during free behaviour showed native spiking patterns in anterodorsal BNST neurons that differentiated safe and anxiogenic environments. These results demonstrate that distinct BNST subregions exert opposite effects in modulating anxiety, establish separable anxiolytic roles for different anterodorsal BNST projections, and illustrate circuit mechanisms underlying selection of features for the assembly of the anxious state.","[Kim, Sung-Yon; Adhikari, Avishek; Lee, Soo Yeun; Marshel, James H.; Kim, Christina K.; Mallory, Caitlin S.; Lo, Maisie; Pak, Sally; Mattis, Joanna; Warden, Melissa R.; Tye, Kay M.; Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Dept Bioengn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kim, Sung-Yon; Kim, Christina K.; Mallory, Caitlin S.; Mattis, Joanna; Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Neurosci Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lee, Soo Yeun; Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, CNC Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lim, Byung Kook; Malenka, Robert C.; Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Neve, Rachael; Tye, Kay M.] MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Deisseroth, K (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Bioengn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",deissero@stanford.edu,"Tye, Kay/J-6158-2013; Adhikari, Avishek/A-3339-2012; Adhikari, Avishek/N-1284-2015; Warden, Melissa/M-9300-2016","Tye, Kay/0000-0002-2435-0182; Adhikari, Avishek/0000-0002-9187-9211; Adhikari, Avishek/0000-0002-9187-9211; Warden, Melissa/0000-0003-2240-3997; Marshel, James/0000-0003-3517-8493; Kim, Sung-Yon/0000-0003-0791-7308; Kim, Christina/0000-0002-1466-7098",Samsung Scholarship; US National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH); Berry Fellowship; NARSAD; Wiegers Family Fund; NIMH; US National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA); DARPA REPAIR Program; Keck Foundation; McKnight Foundation; Gatsby Charitable Foundation; Snyder Foundation; Woo Foundation; Tarlton Foundation; Albert Yu and Mary Bechman Foundation,"We thank M.

The extended amygdala, including the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), modulates fear and anxiety(3,4), but also projects to the ventral tegmental area (VTA)(5,6), a region implicated in reward and aversion(7-13), thus providing a candidate neural substrate for integrating diverse emotional states. However, the precise functional connectivity between distinct BNST projection neurons and their postsynaptic targets in the VTA, as well as the role of this circuit in controlling motivational states, have not been described. Here we record and manipulate the activity of genetically and neurochemically identified VTA-projecting BNST neurons in freely behaving mice. Collectively, aversive stimuli exposure produced heterogeneous firing patterns in VTA-projecting BNST neurons. By contrast, in vivo optically identified glutamatergic projection neurons displayed a net enhancement of activity to aversive stimuli, whereas the firing rate of identified GABAergic (gamma-aminobutyric acid-containing) projection neurons was suppressed. Channelrhodopsin-2-assisted circuit mapping revealed that both BNST glutamatergic and GABAergic projections preferentially innervate postsynaptic non-dopaminergic VTA neurons, thus providing a mechanistic framework for in vivo circuit perturbations. In vivo photostimulation of BNST glutamatergic projections resulted in aversive and anxiogenic behavioural phenotypes. Conversely, activation of BNST GABAergic projections produced rewarding and anxiolytic phenotypes, which were also recapitulated by direct inhibition of VTA GABAergic neurons. These data demonstrate that functionally opposing BNST to VTA circuits regulate rewarding and aversive motivational states, and may serve as a crucial circuit node for bidirectionally normalizing maladaptive behaviours.","[Jennings, Joshua H.; Sparta, Dennis R.; Stamatakis, Alice M.; Ung, Randall L.; Stuber, Garret D.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Psychiat, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Jennings, Joshua H.; Stamatakis, Alice M.; Kash, Thomas L.; Stuber, Garret D.] Univ N Carolina, Neurobiol Curriculum, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Sparta, Dennis R.; Pleil, Kristen E.; Kash, Thomas L.; Stuber, Garret D.] Univ N Carolina, Bowles Ctr Alcohol Studies, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Pleil, Kristen E.; Kash, Thomas L.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Pharmacol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Kash, Thomas L.; Stuber, Garret D.] Univ N Carolina, Ctr Neurosci, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Stuber, Garret D.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Cell Biol & Physiol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA","Stuber, GD (reprint author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Psychiat, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",gstuber@med.unc.edu,"Kash, Thomas/G-9625-2013; Stuber, Garret/E-1160-2011","Stuber, Garret/0000-0003-1730-4855","Whitehall Foundation; Foundation of Hope; National Institutes of Health [DA029325, DA032750, AA018610, AA007573, NS007431, DA034472, AA021043]; UNC NIAAA alcohol research center [AA011605]","We thank M.

In one model, lymphoid and myeloid production branch after the lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitor (LMPP)(1), with both branches subsequently producing dendritic cells(2). However, this model is based mainly on in vitro clonal assays and population-based tracking in vivo, which could miss in vivo single-cell complexity(3-7). Here we avoid these issues by using a new quantitative version of 'cellular barcoding'(8-10) to trace the in vivo fate of hundreds of LMPPs and HSCs at the single-cell level. These data demonstrate that LMPPs are highly heterogeneous in the cell types that they produce, separating into combinations of lymphoid-, myeloid-and dendritic-cell-biased producers. Conversely, although we observe a known lineage bias of some HSCs11-14, most cellular output is derived from a small number of HSCs that each generates all cell types. Crucially, in vivo analysis of the output of sibling cells derived from single LMPPs shows that they often share a similar fate, suggesting that the fate of these progenitors was imprinted. Furthermore, as this imprinting is also observed for dendritic-cell-biased LMPPs, dendritic cells may be considered a distinct lineage on the basis of separate ancestry. These data suggest a 'graded commitment' model of haematopoiesis, in which heritable and diverse lineage imprinting occurs earlier than previously thought.","[Naik, Shalin H.; Perie, Leila; Swart, Erwin; Gerlach, Carmen; van Rooij, Nienke; Schumacher, Ton N.] Netherlands Canc Inst, Div Immunol, NL-1066 CX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Perie, Leila; de Boer, Rob J.] Univ Utrecht, NL-3584 CH Utrecht, Netherlands","Naik, SH (reprint author), Walter & Eliza Hall Inst Med Res, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia.",naik.s@wehi.edu.au; t.schumacher@nki.nl,"De Boer, Rob/B-6050-2011","De Boer, Rob/0000-0002-2130-691X; Naik, Shalin/0000-0003-0299-3301",ERC grant LIFE-HIS-T and HFSP [RGP0060/2012]; National Health and Medical Research Council Australia; Marie Curie Incoming International FP6 Fellowship; Leukemia and Lymphoma Society; Marie Curie Intra European FP7 Fellowship; Bettencourt Schueller Fondation,"We thank G.

However, these are produced by all microbes, regardless of their pathogenic potential. To distinguish virulent microbes from those with lower disease-causing potential the innate immune system detects conserved pathogen-induced processes(2), such as the presence of microbial products in the host cytosol, by mechanisms that are not fully resolved. Here we show that NOD1 senses cytosolic microbial products by monitoring the activation state of small Rho GTPases. Activation of RAC1 and CDC42 by bacterial delivery or ectopic expression of SopE, a virulence factor of the enteric pathogen Salmonella, triggered the NOD1 signalling pathway, with consequent RIP2 (also known as RIPK2)-mediated induction of NF-kappa B-dependent inflammatory responses. Similarly, activation of the NOD1 signalling pathway by peptidoglycan required RAC1 activity. Furthermore, constitutively active forms of RAC1, CDC42 and RHOA activated the NOD1 signalling pathway. Our data identify the activation of small Rho GTPases as a pathogen-induced process sensed through the NOD1 signalling pathway.","[Keestra, A.

Here we show that inhibition of glycolysis with 2-deoxyglucose suppresses lipopolysaccharide-induced interleukin-1 beta but not tumour-necrosis factor-a in mouse macrophages. A comprehensive metabolic map of lipopolysaccharide-activated macrophages shows upregulation of glycolytic and down-regulation of mitochondrial genes, which correlates directly with the expression profiles of altered metabolites. Lipopolysaccharide strongly increases the levels of the tricarboxylic-acid cycle intermediate succinate. Glutamine-dependent anerplerosis is the principal source of succinate, although the 'GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) shunt' pathway also has a role. Lipopolysaccharide-induced succinate stabilizes hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha, an effect that is inhibited by 2-deoxyglucose, with interleukin-1 beta as an important target. Lipopolysaccharide also increases succinylation of several proteins. We therefore identify succinate as a metabolite in innate immune signalling, which enhances interleukin-1 beta production during inflammation.","[Tannahill, G. M.; Curtis, A.

During pilus biogenesis, subunits are recruited to an outer membrane assembly platform, the FimD usher, which catalyses their polymerization and mediates pilus secretion(2). The recent determination of the crystal structure of an initiation complex provided insight into the initiation step of pilus biogenesis resulting in pore activation, but very little is known about the elongation steps that follow(3). Here, to address this question, we determine the structure of an elongation complex in which the tip complex assembly composed of FimC, FimF, FimG and FimH passes through FimD. This structure demonstrates the conformational changes required to prevent backsliding of the nascent pilus through the FimD pore and also reveals unexpected properties of the usher pore. We show that the circular binding interface between the pore lumen and the folded substrate participates in transport by defining a low-energy pathway along which the nascent pilus polymer is guided during secretion.","[Geibel, Sebastian; Waksman, Gabriel] UCL, Inst Struct & Mol Biol, London WC1E 7HX, England; [Geibel, Sebastian; Waksman, Gabriel] Univ London Birkbeck Coll, London WC1E 7HX, England; [Procko, Erik; Baker, David] Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Procko, Erik; Baker, David] Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Hultgren, Scott J.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Womens Infect Dis Res, St Louis, MO 63011 USA; [Hultgren, Scott J.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol Microbiol, St Louis, MO 63011 USA","Waksman, G (reprint author), UCL, Inst Struct & Mol Biol, Malet St, London WC1E 7HX, England.",dabaker@u.washington.edu; g.waksman@ucl.ac.uk,"Geibel, Sebastian/B-5607-2015; Baker, David/K-8941-2012","Geibel, Sebastian/0000-0003-0068-680X; Baker, David/0000-0001-7896-6217; Procko, Erik/0000-0002-0028-490X",Medical Research Council [85602]; National Institute of General Medical Studies at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) [P41 GM103533]; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease at the NIH [AI029549],"This work was funded by Medical Research Council grant 85602 to G.

MATE transporters confer multidrug resistance to bacterial pathogens(3-6) and cancer cells(7), thus causing critical reductions in the therapeutic efficacies of antibiotics and anti-cancer drugs, respectively. Therefore, the development of MATE inhibitors has long been awaited in the field of clinical medicine(8,9). Here we present the crystal structures of the H+-driven MATE transporter from Pyrococcus furiosus in two distinct apo-form conformations, and in complexes with a derivative of the antibacterial drug norfloxacin and three in vitro selected thioether-macrocyclic peptides, at 2.1-3.0 angstrom resolutions. The structures, combined with functional analyses, show that the protonation of Asp 41 on the amino (N)-terminal lobe induces the bending of TM1, which in turn collapses the N-lobe cavity, thereby extruding the substrate drug to the extracellular space. Moreover, the macrocyclic peptides bind the central cleft in distinct manners, which correlate with their inhibitory activities. The strongest inhibitory peptide that occupies the N-lobe cavity may pave the way towards the development of efficient inhibitors against MATE transporters.","[Tanaka, Yoshiki; Kato, Hideaki E.; Hattori, Motoyuki; Kumazaki, Kaoru; Tsukazaki, Tomoya; Ishitani, Ryuichiro; Nureki, Osamu] RIKEN Adv Sci Inst, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Tanaka, Yoshiki; Kato, Hideaki E.; Hattori, Motoyuki; Kumazaki, Kaoru; Tsukazaki, Tomoya; Ishitani, Ryuichiro; Nureki, Osamu] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biophys & Biochem, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130032, Japan; [Hipolito, Christopher J.; Higuchi, Takashi; Katoh, Takayuki; Suga, Hiroaki] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Chem, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Maturana, Andres D.] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Bioagr Sci, Dept Bioengn Sci, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Ito, Koichi] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Dept Med Genome Sci, Chiba 2778562, Japan; [Kuroda, Teruo] Okayama Univ, Grad Sch Med Dent & Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Genome Appl Microbiol, Okayama 7008530, Japan; [Hattori, Motoyuki; Tsukazaki, Tomoya] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, Precursory Res Embryon Sci & Technol PRESTO, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan","Nureki, O (reprint author), RIKEN Adv Sci Inst, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan.",hsuga@chem.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp; nureki@biochem.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Hattori, Motoyuki/B-6069-2014; KURODA, Teruo/B-2028-2011","Tanaka, Yoshiki/0000-0001-6960-5276; Kato, Hideaki/0000-0002-1941-5535","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS); Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology Program 'The Creation of Basic Medical Technologies to Clarify and Control the Mechanisms Underlying Chronic Inflammation' of Japan Science and Technology Agency; MEXT [24227004, 22687007, P11344]; JSPS [21000005]","We are grateful to the beam-line staff at BL32XU of SPring-8 for assistance in data collection (proposals 2011B1062, 2012A1087 and 2012B1161), and the RIKEN BioResource Center (Ibaraki, Japan) for providing the P. furiosus genomic DNA.

The gradual cooling that followed led to the establishment of modern temperature patterns, possibly in response to a decrease in atmospheric CO2 concentration, of the order of 100 parts per million, towards preindustrial values. Here we synthesize the available geochemical proxy records of sea surface temperature and show that, compared with that of today, the early Pliocene climate had substantially lower meridional and zonal temperature gradients but similar maximum ocean temperatures. Using an Earth system model, we show that none of the mechanisms currently proposed to explain Pliocene warmth can simultaneously reproduce all three crucial features. We suggest that a combination of several dynamical feedbacks underestimated in the models at present, such as those related to ocean mixing and cloud albedo, may have been responsible for these climate conditions.","[Fedorov, A.

The widely accepted explanation posits that the oceanic Farallon plate acted as a conveyor belt, sweeping terranes into the continental margin while subducting under it. Here we show that this hypothesis, which fails to explain many terrane complexities, is also inconsistent with new tomographic images of lower-mantle slabs, and with their locations relative to plate reconstructions. We offer a reinterpretation of North American palaeogeography and test it quantitatively: collision events are clearly recorded by slab geometry, and can be time calibrated and reconciled with plate reconstructions and surface geology. The seas west of Cretaceous North America must have resembled today's western Pacific, strung with island arcs. All proto-Pacific plates initially subducted into almost stationary, intra-oceanic trenches, and accumulated below as massive vertical slab walls. Above the slabs, long-lived volcanic archipelagos and subduction complexes grew. Crustal accretion occurred when North America overrode the archipelagos, causing major episodes of Cordilleran mountain building.","[Sigloch, Karin] Univ Munich, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Mihalynuk, Mitchell G.] British Columbia Geol Survey, Victoria, BC V8W 9N3, Canada","Sigloch, K (reprint author), Univ Munich, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Theresienstr 41, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",sigloch@geophysik.uni-muenchen.de; Mitch.Mihalynuk@gov.bc.ca,,,,,,52,76,76,10,92,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-Apr,2013,496,7443,,,,,50,+,,10.1038/nature12019,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,117ZZ,WOS:000316993400023,23552944.0,No,,,11/20/17,mitchell g.,mihalynuk,na,na,na,na,na

Here we present an analysis of tapeworm genome sequences using the human-infective species Echinococcus multilocularis, E. granulosus, Taenia solium and the laboratory model Hymenolepis microstoma as examples. The 115- to 141-megabase genomes offer insights into the evolution of parasitism. Synteny is maintained with distantly related blood flukes but we find extreme losses of genes and pathways that are ubiquitous in other animals, including 34 homeobox families and several determinants of stem cell fate.

To drive clock oscillations, mammalian CRYs associate with the Period proteins (PERs) and together inhibit the transcription of their own genes. The SCFFBXL3 ubiquitin ligase complex controls this negative feedback loop by promoting CRY ubiquitination and degradation. However, the molecular mechanisms of their interactions and the functional role of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) binding in CRYs remain poorly understood. Here we report crystal structures of mammalian CRY2 in its apo, FAD-bound and FBXL3-SKP1-complexed forms. Distinct from other cryptochromes of known structures, mammalian CRY2 binds FAD dynamically with an open cofactor pocket. Notably, the F-box protein FBXL3 captures CRY2 by simultaneously occupying its FAD-binding pocket with a conserved carboxy-terminal tail and burying its PER-binding interface. This novel F-box-protein-substrate bipartite interaction is susceptible to disruption by both FAD and PERs, suggesting a new avenue for pharmacological targeting of the complex and a multifaceted regulatory mechanism of CRY ubiquitination.","[Xing, Weiman; Hinds, Thomas R.; Saifee, Nabiha H.; Zheng, Ning] Univ Washington, Dept Pharmacol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Xing, Weiman; Zheng, Ning] Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Busino, Luca; Pagano, Michele] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, NYU Canc Inst, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Marionni, Samuel T.; Bush, Matthew F.] Univ Washington, Dept Chem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Pagano, Michele] NYU, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10016 USA","Zheng, N (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Pharmacol, Box 357280, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",nzheng@u.washington.edu,,"pagano, michele/0000-0003-3210-2442; Huq Saifee, Nabiha/0000-0003-1646-9201; Bush, Matthew/0000-0003-3526-4973","Howard Hughes Medical Institute; National Institutes of Health [R01-CA107134, 5T32-HL007151, R01-GM057587, R37-CA-076584, R21-CA161108]; University of Washington","We thank the beamline staff of the Advanced Light Source at the University of California at Berkeley for help with data collection, and members of the Zheng laboratory for discussion.

This challenge is met by all-optical magnetic switching based on coherent spin manipulation(1). By analogy to femtosecond chemistry and photosynthetic dynamics(2)-in which photoproducts of chemical and biochemical reactions can be influenced by creating suitable superpositions of molecular states-femtosecond-laser-excited coherence between electronic states can switch magnetic order by 'suddenly' breaking the delicate balance between competing phases of correlated materials: for example, manganites exhibiting colossal magneto-resistance suitable for applications(3,4). Here we show femtosecond (10(-15) seconds) photo-induced switching from anti-ferromagnetic to ferromagnetic ordering in Pr0.7Ca0.3MnO3, by observing the establishment (within about 120 femtoseconds) of a huge temperature-dependent magnetization with photo-excitation threshold behaviour absent in the optical reflectivity. The development of ferromagnetic correlations during the femtosecond laser pulse reveals an initial quantum coherent regime of magnetism, distinguished from the picosecond (10(-12) seconds) lattice-heating regime characterized by phase separation without threshold behaviour(5,6). Our simulations reproduce the nonlinear femtosecond spin generation and underpin fast quantum spin-flip fluctuations correlated with coherent superpositions of electronic states to initiate local ferromagnetic correlations. These results merge two fields, femtosecond magnetism in metals and band insulators(1,7-9), and non-equilibrium phase transitions of strongly correlated electrons(10-17), in which local interactions exceeding the kinetic energy produce a complex balance of competing orders.","[Li, Tianqi; Patz, Aaron; Wang, Jigang] Iowa State Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Li, Tianqi; Patz, Aaron; Yan, Jiaqiang; Lograsso, Thomas A.; Wang, Jigang] US DOE, Ames Lab, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Mouchliadis, Leonidas; Perakis, Ilias E.] Univ Crete, Dept Phys, Iraklion 71003, Crete, Greece; [Mouchliadis, Leonidas; Perakis, Ilias E.] Fdn Res & Technol Hellas, Inst Elect Struct & Laser, Iraklion 71110, Crete, Greece","Wang, JG (reprint author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",ilias@physics.uoc.gr; jgwang@iastate.edu,"Li, Tianqi/C-5142-2014; Perakis, Ilias/G-9186-2011","Li, Tianqi/0000-0002-5238-8540; ","National Science Foundation [DMR-1055352]; US Department of Energy-Basic Energy Sciences [DE-AC02-7CH11358]; Project BIOSOLENUTI [FP7-REGPOT-2008-1, 229927]; EU Social Fund; National resources through the THALES program NANOPHOS","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation (contract no.

Several experimental methods can be used to visualize dislocations. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has long been used to image dislocations in materials(5-9), and high-resolution electron microscopy can reveal dislocation core structures in high detail(10), particularly in annular dark-field mode(11). A TEM image, however, represents a two-dimensional projection of a three-dimensional (3D) object (although stereo TEM provides limited information about 3D dislocations(4)). X-ray topography can image dislocations in three dimensions, but with reduced resolution(12). Using weak-beam dark-field TEM13 and scanning TEM14, electron tomography has been used to image 3D dislocations at a resolution of about five nanometres (refs 15, 16). Atom probe tomography can offer higher-resolution 3D characterization of dislocations, but requires needle-shaped samples and can detect only about 60 per cent of the atoms in a sample(17). Here we report 3D imaging of dislocations in materials at atomic resolution by electron tomography. By applying 3D Fourier filtering together with equal-slope tomographic reconstruction, we observe nearly all the atoms in a multiply twinned platinum nanoparticle. We observed atomic steps at 3D twin boundaries and imaged the 3D core structure of edge and screw dislocations at atomic resolution. These dislocations and the atomic steps at the twin boundaries, which appear to be stress-relief mechanisms, are not visible in conventional two-dimensional projections. The ability to image 3D disordered structures such as dislocations at atomic resolution is expected to find applications in materials science, nanoscience, solid-state physics and chemistry.","[Chen, Chien-Chun; Zhu, Chun; White, Edward R.; Scott, M.

In particular, achieving precise control of the behaviour of group III and group V dopants has been a crucial step in the development of silicon (Si) nanowire-based devices(5-7). Recently(8-11) it has been demonstrated that the use of aluminium (Al) as a growth catalyst, instead of the usual gold, also yields an effective p-type doping, thereby enabling a novel and efficient route to functionalizing Si nanowires. Besides the technological implications, this self-doping implies the detachment of Al from the catalyst and its injection into the growing nanowire, involving atomic-scale processes that are crucial for the fundamental understanding of the catalytic assembly of nanowires. Here we present an atomic-level, quantitative study of this phenomenon of catalyst dissolution by three-dimensional atom-by-atom mapping of individual Al-catalysed Si nanowires using highly focused ultraviolet-laser-assisted atom-probe tomography. Although the observed incorporation of the catalyst atoms into nanowires exceeds by orders of magnitude the equilibrium solid solubility(12) and solid-solution concentrations in known non-equilibrium processes(13,14), the Al impurities are found to be homogeneously distributed in the nanowire and do not form precipitates or clusters. As well as the anticipated effect on the electrical properties, this kinetics-driven colossal injection also has direct implications for nanowire morphology. We discuss the observed strong deviation from equilibrium using a model of solute trapping at step edges, and identify the key growth parameters behind this phenomenon on the basis of a kinetic model of step-flow growth of nanowires. The control of this phenomenon provides opportunities to create a new class of nanoscale devices by precisely tailoring the shape and composition of metal-catalysed nanowires.","[Moutanabbir, Oussama] Ecole Polytech, Dept Engn Phys, Montreal, PQ H3C 3A7, Canada; [Isheim, Dieter; Seidman, David N.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Isheim, Dieter; Seidman, David N.] Northwestern Univ, NUCAPT, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Blumtritt, Horst; Senz, Stephan; Pippel, Eckhard] Max Planck Inst Microstruct Phys, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany","Moutanabbir, O (reprint author), Ecole Polytech, Dept Engn Phys, CP 6079,Succursale Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3A7, Canada.",oussama.moutanabbir@polymtl.ca,"Moutanabbir, Oussama/A-4001-2009; Seidman, David/B-6697-2009",,NSERC; Canada Research Chair; Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal (PIED); US-Israel Binational Science Foundation; Max Planck Institute of Microstructure Physics,"O.M. acknowledges support from NSERC, the Canada Research Chair, and Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal (PIED).

In July 2012, an historically rare period of extended surface melting was observed across almost the entire Greenland ice sheet(1,2), raising questions about the frequency and spatial extent of such events. Here we show that low-level clouds consisting of liquid water droplets ('liquid clouds'), via their radiative effects, played a key part in this melt event by increasing near-surface temperatures. We used a suite of surface-based observations(3), remote sensing data, and a surface energy-balance model. At the critical surface melt time, the clouds were optically thick enough and low enough to enhance the down-welling infrared flux at the surface. At the same time they were optically thin enough to allow sufficient solar radiation to penetrate through them and raise surface temperatures above the melting point. Outside this narrow range in cloud optical thickness, the radiative contribution to the surface energy budget would have been diminished, and the spatial extent of this melting event would have been smaller. We further show that these thin, low-level liquid clouds occur frequently, both over Greenland and across the Arctic, being present around 30-50 per cent of the time(3-6). Our results may help to explain the difficulties that global climate models have in simulating the Arctic surface energy budget(7-9), particularly as models tend to under-predict the formation of optically thin liquid clouds at supercooled temperatures(6)-a process potentially necessary to account fully for temperature feedbacks in a warming Arctic climate.","[Bennartz, R.] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Shupe, M.

However, the complex polyploid nature of its genome makes genetic and functional analyses extremely challenging. The A genome, as a basic genome of bread wheat and other polyploid wheats, for example, T. turgidum (AABB), T. timopheevii (AAGG) and T. zhukovskyi (AAGGA(m)A(m)), is central to wheat evolution, domestication and genetic improvement(1). The progenitor species of the A genome is the diploid wild einkorn wheat T. urartu(2), which resembles cultivated wheat more extensively than do Aegilops speltoides (the ancestor of the B genome(3)) and Ae. tauschii (the donor of the D genome(4)), especially in the morphology and development of spike and seed. Here we present the generation, assembly and analysis of a whole-genome shotgun draft sequence of the T. urartu genome. We identified protein-coding gene models, performed genome structure analyses and assessed its utility for analysing agronomically important genes and for developing molecular markers. Our T. urartu genome assembly provides a diploid reference for analysis of polyploid wheat genomes and is a valuable resource for the genetic improvement of wheat.","[Ling, Hong-Qing; Liu, Dongcheng; Wang, Junyi; Sun, Hua; Fan, Huajie; Dong, Lingli; Wu, Huilan; Li, Yiwen; Cui, Yan; Zheng, Shusong; Wang, Biao; Yu, Kang; Yang, Wenlong; Lou, Xueyuan; Zhang, Xiaofei; Luo, Guangbin; Zhang, Bairu; Tang, Dingzhong; Shen, Qianhua; Xue, Pengya; Zou, Shenhao; Liu, Xin; Wang, Famin; Yang, Yanping; An, Xueli; Dong, Zhenying; Zhang, Kunpu; Zhang, Xiangqi; Tong, Yiping; Li, Zhensheng; Wang, Daowen; Zhang, Aimin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Genet & Dev Biol, State Key Lab Plant Cell & Chromosome Engn, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Shancen; Wang, Junyi; Zhang, Chi; Li, Dong; Tao, Yong; Gao, Chuan; Guo, Xiaosen; Liang, Qinsi; Chen, Jie; Feng, Mingji; Jian, Jianbo; Jiang, Ying; Liu, Junjie; Wang, Zhaobao; Sha, Yuhui; Wang, Jian; Yang, Huanming; Wang, Jun] BGI Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518038, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Shancen] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, State Key Lab Agrobiotechnol, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Shancen] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Sch Life Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wu, Huajun; Wang, Xiujie] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Genet & Dev Biol, State Key Lab Plant Genom, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Luo, Ming-Cheng; Dvorak, Jan] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Wang, Jun] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Wang, Jun] King Abdulaziz Univ, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia","Wang, J (reprint author), BGI Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518038, Peoples R China.",hqling@genetics.ac.cn; zsli@genetics.ac.cn; dwwang@genetics.ac.cn; amzhang@genetics.ac.cn; wangj@genomics.cn,"Wang, Jun/C-8434-2016; Shen, Qian-Hua/D-2734-2013; Wang, Jun/B-9503-2016","Wang, Jun/0000-0002-8540-8931; Shen, Qian-Hua/0000-0002-9446-3086; zhang, xiaofei/0000-0003-4516-9179; Wang, Jun/0000-0002-2113-5874; wang, dao wen/0000-0002-6230-8735","Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2010DFB33540, 2011CB100304, 2011AA100104, 2009CB118300]","We thank L.

Wheat has since become a primary staple crop worldwide as a result of its enhanced adaptability to a wide range of climates and improved grain quality for the production of baker's flour(2). Here we describe sequencing the Ae. tauschii genome and obtaining a roughly 90-fold depth of short reads from libraries with various insert sizes, to gain a better understanding of this genetically complex plant. The assembled scaffolds represented 83.4% of the genome, of which 65.9% comprised transposable elements. We generated comprehensive RNA-Seq data and used it to identify 43,150 protein-coding genes, of which 30,697 (71.1%) were uniquely anchored to chromosomes with an integrated high-density genetic map. Whole-genome analysis revealed gene family expansion in Ae. tauschii of agronomically relevant gene families that were associated with disease resistance, abiotic stress tolerance and grain quality. This draft genome sequence provides insight into the environmental adaptation of bread wheat and can aid in defining the large and complicated genomes of wheat species.","[Jia, Jizeng; Kong, Xiuying; Zhao, Guangyao; Zhang, Xueyong; Jing, Ruilian; Ma, Youzhi; Gao, Lifeng; Xia, Xianchun; Zhang, Rongzhi; Liu, Xu; He, Zhonghu; Mao, Long] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Crop Sci, Natl Key Facil Crop Gene Resources & Genet Improv, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Shancen; Li, Yingrui; He, Weiming; Tao, Yong; Zhang, Chi; Gao, Chuan; Li, Dong; Pan, Shengkai; Zheng, Fengya; Li, Jianwen; Liang, Qinsi; Chen, Jie; Gou, Caiyun; He, Genyun; Luo, Yadan; Xia, Qiuju; Lu, Peng; Wang, Junyi; Zou, Hongfeng; Xu, Junyang; Gao, Jinlong; Quan, Zhiwu; Wang, Jian; Yang, Huanming; Wang, Jun] BGI Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Shancen; Zheng, Fengya] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, State Key Lab Agrobiotechnol, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Shancen; Zheng, Fengya] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Sch Life Sci, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Appels, Rudi] Murdoch Univ, Ctr Comparat Genom, Perth, WA 6150, Australia; [Pfeifer, Matthias; Spannagl, Manuel; Mayer, Klaus F.

However, the developmental mechanisms underlying the formation of functionally organized connectivity in cortical microcircuits remain unknown. Here we directly relate patterns of excitatory synaptic connectivity to visual response properties of neighbouring layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in mouse visual cortex at different postnatal ages, using two-photon calcium imaging in vivo and multiple whole-cell recordings in vitro. Although neural responses were already highly selective for visual stimuli at eye opening, neurons responding to similar visual features were not yet preferentially connected, indicating that the emergence of feature selectivity does not depend on the precise arrangement of local synaptic connections. After eye opening, local connectivity reorganized extensively: more connections formed selectively between neurons with similar visual responses and connections were eliminated between visually unresponsive neurons, but the overall connectivity rate did not change. We propose a sequential model of cortical microcircuit development based on activity-dependent mechanisms of plasticity whereby neurons first acquire feature preference by selecting feedforward inputs before the onset of sensory experience-a process that may be facilitated by early electrical coupling between neuronal subsets(7-9)-and then patterned input drives the formation of functional subnetworks through a redistribution of recurrent synaptic connections.","[Ko, Ho; Cossell, Lee; Baragli, Chiara; Antolik, Jan; Hofer, Sonja B.; Mrsic-Flogel, Thomas D.] UCL, Dept Neurosci Physiol & Pharmacol, London WC1E 6DE, England; [Clopath, Claudia] Columbia Univ, Ctr Theoret Neurosci, New York, NY 10032 USA","Hofer, SB (reprint author), UCL, Dept Neurosci Physiol & Pharmacol, 21 Univ St, London WC1E 6DE, England.",s.hofer@ucl.ac.uk; t.mrsic-flogel@ucl.ac.uk,"Ko, Ho/I-7513-2016","Ko, Ho/0000-0002-0254-3274",Wellcome Trust; Medical Research Council; European Research Council; 7th Framework of European Commission 'EuroV1sion' grant; Swiss National Science Foundation [PA00P3_139703],"We thank C.

Among these dependencies is an increased use of the amino acid glutamine to fuel anabolic processes(2). Indeed, the spectrum of glutamine-dependent tumours and the mechanisms whereby glutamine supports cancer metabolism remain areas of active investigation. Here we report the identification of a non-canonical pathway of glutamine use in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells that is required for tumour growth. Whereas most cells use glutamate dehydrogenase (GLUD1) to convert glutamine-derived glutamate into alpha-ketoglutarate in the mitochondria to fuel the tricarboxylic acid cycle, PDAC relies on a distinct pathway in which glutamine-derived aspartate is transported into the cytoplasm where it can be converted into oxaloacetate by aspartate transaminase (GOT1). Subsequently, this oxaloacetate is converted into malate and then pyruvate, ostensibly increasing the NADPH/NADP(+) ratio which can potentially maintain the cellular redox state. Importantly, PDAC cells are strongly dependent on this series of reactions, as glutamine deprivation or genetic inhibition of any enzyme in this pathway leads to an increase in reactive oxygen species and a reduction in reduced glutathione. Moreover, knockdown of any component enzyme in this series of reactions also results in a pronounced suppression of PDAC growth in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we establish that the reprogramming of glutamine metabolism is mediated by oncogenic KRAS, the signature genetic alteration in PDAC, through the transcriptional upregulation and repression of key metabolic enzymes in this pathway. The essentiality of this pathway in PDAC and the fact that it is dispensable in normal cells may provide novel therapeutic approaches to treat these refractory tumours.","[Son, Jaekyoung; Wang, Xiaoxu; Kimmelman, Alec C.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Radiat Oncol, Div Genom Stabil & DNA Repair, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Lyssiotis, Costas A.; Mullarky, Edouard; Ng Shyh-Chang; Cantley, Lewis C.] Harvard Univ, Dept Syst Biol, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Lyssiotis, Costas A.; Mullarky, Edouard; Cantley, Lewis C.] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Div Signal Transduct, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Ying, Haoqiang; Hua, Sujun; DePinho, Ronald A.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Genom Med, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Ligorio, Matteo; Ferrone, Cristina R.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Surg, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Perera, Rushika M.; Bardeesy, Nabeel] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Canc, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Ng Shyh-Chang] Childrens Hosp, Div Pediat Hematol Oncol, Stem Cell Transplantat Program, Stem Cell Program, Boston, MA 02130 USA; [Ng Shyh-Chang] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Boston, MA 02130 USA; [Kang, Ya'an; Fleming, Jason B.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Surg Oncol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Asara, John M.] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Haigis, Marcia C.] Harvard Univ, Dept Cell Biol, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Cantley, LC (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Syst Biol, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",lec2014@med.cornell.edu; Alec_Kimmelman@DFCI.harvard.edu,"Cantley, Lewis/D-1800-2014","Cantley, Lewis/0000-0002-1298-7653; Shyh-Chang, Ng/0000-0003-3138-9525","Dana Farber Cancer Institute; National Cancer Institute [R01 CA157490]; Kimmel Scholar Award; AACR-PanCAN Career Development Award; NIH [T32 CA009382-26, P01 CA117969, 5P01CA120964-05]; Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center Support Grant [5P30CA006516-46]","We would like to thank D.

The ability of the myristoyl group to facilitate dynamic protein-protein and protein-membrane interactions (known as the myristoyl switch) makes it an essential feature of many signal transduction systems(3). Thus pathogenic strategies that facilitate protein demyristoylation would markedly alter the signalling landscape of infected host cells. Here we describe an irreversible mechanism of protein demyristoylation catalysed by invasion plasmid antigen J (IpaJ), a previously uncharacterized Shigella flexneri type III effector protein with cysteine protease activity. A yeast genetic screen for IpaJ substrates identified ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF)1p and ARF2p, small molecular mass GTPases that regulate cargo transport through the Golgi apparatus(4). Mass spectrometry showed that IpaJ cleaved the peptide bond between N-myristoylated glycine-2 and asparagine-3 of human ARF1, thereby providing a new mechanism for host secretory inhibition by a bacterial pathogen(5,6). We further demonstrate that IpaJ cleaves an array of N-myristoylated proteins involved in cellular growth, signal transduction, autophagasome maturation and organelle function. Taken together, these findings show a previously unrecognized pathogenic mechanism for the site-specific elimination of N-myristoyl protein modification.","[Burnaevskiy, Nikolay; Weigele, Bethany A.; Selyunin, Andrey S.; Alto, Neal M.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Microbiol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Fox, Thomas G.] Indiana Univ Sch Med, Sect Pediat Infect Dis, Dept Pediat, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Plymire, Daniel A.; Patrie, Steven M.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Pathol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Ertelt, James M.; Way, Sing Sing] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Infect Dis, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA","Alto, NM (reprint author), Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Microbiol, 5323 Harry Hines Blvd, Dallas, TX 75390 USA.",neal.alto@utsouthwestern.edu,,"Way, Sing Sing/0000-0001-8948-1952","Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas [RP120613]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; National Institutes of Health (NIAID) [5T32AI007520, RO1AI083359]; Burroughs Wellcome Fund; National Institutes of Health (NIGMS) [R01GM100486]; Welch Foundation [I-1704]","We thank our colleagues at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, specifically K.

However, four of the seven mammalian sirtuins have very weak deacetylase activity in vitro. Here we show that human SIRT6 efficiently removes long-chain fatty acyl groups, such as myristoyl, from lysine residues. The crystal structure of SIRT6 reveals a large hydrophobic pocket that can accommodate long-chain fatty acyl groups. We demonstrate further that SIRT6 promotes the secretion of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) by removing the fatty acyl modification on K19 and K20 of TNF-alpha. Protein lysine fatty acylation has been known to occur in mammalian cells, but the function and regulatory mechanisms of this modification were unknown. Our data indicate that protein lysine fatty acylation is a novel mechanism that regulates protein secretion. The discovery of SIRT6 as an enzyme that controls protein lysine fatty acylation provides new opportunities to investigate the physiological function of a protein post-translational modification that has been little studied until now.","[Jiang, Hong; Khan, Saba; He, Bin; Du, Jintang; Kim, Ray; Ge, Eva; Lin, Hening] Cornell Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Wang, Yi; Hao, Quan] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Physiol, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Charron, Guillaume; Hang, Howard C.] Rockefeller Univ, Lab Chem Biol & Microbial Pathogenesis, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Sebastian, Carlos; Mostoslavsky, Raul] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Canc, Boston, MA 02114 USA","Lin, HN (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",qhao@hku.hk; hl379@cornell.edu,"Hao, Quan/C-4304-2009",,"NIH [R01GM086703, R01GM093072, R01GM087544];  [GRF766510]","This work was supported in part by NIH R01GM086703 (H.

Enzymes of this class typically catalyse oxygenation reactions that proceed via the formation of substrate radical intermediates. By contrast, HppE catalyses an unusual dehydrogenation reaction while converting the secondary alcohol of (S)-2-HPP to the epoxide ring of fosfomycin(1,5). Here we show that HppE also catalyses a biologically unprecedented 1,2-phosphono migration with the alternative substrate (R)-1-HPP. This transformation probably involves an intermediary carbocation, based on observations with additional substrate analogues, such as (1R)-1-hydroxyl-2-aminopropylphosphonate, and model reactions for both radical- and carbocation-mediated migration. The ability of HppE to catalyse distinct reactions depending on the regio- and stereochemical properties of the substrate is given a structural basis using X-ray crystallography. These results provide compelling evidence for the formation of a substrate-derived cation intermediate in the catalytic cycle of a mononuclear non-haem-iron-dependent enzyme. The underlying chemistry of this unusual phosphono migration may represent a new paradigm for the in vivo construction of phosphonate-containing natural products that can be exploited for the preparation of new phosphonate derivatives.","[Chang, Wei-chen; Liu, Pinghua; Mansoorabadi, Steven O.; Moon, Sung-Ju; Zhao, Zongbao K.; Liu, Hung-wen] Univ Texas Austin, Coll Pharm, Div Med Chem, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Chang, Wei-chen; Liu, Pinghua; Mansoorabadi, Steven O.; Moon, Sung-Ju; Zhao, Zongbao K.; Liu, Hung-wen] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Chem & Biochem, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Dey, Mishtu; Drennan, Catherine L.] MIT, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Dey, Mishtu; Drennan, Catherine L.] MIT, Dept Chem, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Dey, Mishtu; Drennan, Catherine L.] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Liu, HW (reprint author), Univ Texas Austin, Coll Pharm, Div Med Chem, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",h.w.liu@mail.utexas.edu,"Zhao, Zongbao/F-5518-2011; Mansoorabadi, Steven/I-3688-2017","Zhao, Zongbao/0000-0003-0654-1193; Mansoorabadi, Steven/0000-0002-6369-3815","National Institutes of Health [GM040541]; Welch Foundation [F-1511]; Advanced Light Source, a Department of Energy (DOE) national user facility [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; DOE; National Institutes of Health/National Institute of General Medical Sciences","We thank W.

However, coupled replication presents a largely unrecognized topological problem. Because DNA polymerase must travel a helical path during synthesis, the physical connection between leading- and lagging-strand polymerases causes the daughter strands to entwine, or produces extensive build-up of negative supercoils in the newly synthesized DNA(2-4). How DNA polymerases maintain their connection during coupled replication despite these topological challenges is unknown. Here we examine the dynamics of the Escherichia coli replisome, using ensemble and single-molecule methods, and show that the replisome may solve the topological problem independent of topoisomerases. We find that the lagging-strand polymerase frequently releases from an Okazaki fragment before completion, leaving single-strand gaps behind. Dissociation of the polymerase does not result in loss from the replisome because of its contact with the leading-strand polymerase. This behaviour, referred to as 'signal release', had been thought to require a protein, possibly primase, to pry polymerase from incompletely extended DNA fragments(5-7). However, we observe that signal release is independent of primase and does not seem to require a protein trigger at all. Instead, the lagging-strand polymerase is simply less processive in the context of a replisome. Interestingly, when the lagging-strand polymerase is supplied with primed DNA in trans, uncoupling it from the fork, high processivity is restored. Hence, we propose that coupled polymerases introduce topological changes, possibly by accumulation of superhelical tension in the newly synthesized DNA, that cause lower processivity and transient lagging-strand polymerase dissociation from DNA.","[Kurth, Isabel; Georgescu, Roxana E.; O'Donnell, Mike E.] Rockefeller Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10065 USA","O'Donnell, ME (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, 1230 York Ave, New York, NY 10065 USA.",odonnel@rockefeller.edu,,"O'Donnell, Michael/0000-0001-9002-4214",National Institutes of Health [GM 38839],"We thank L.

Key to these roles is the formation of transient inter-protein electron transfer complexes. The structural basis for the control of specificity between partner proteins is lacking because these weak transient complexes have remained largely intractable for crystallographic studies(2,3). Inter-protein electron transfer processes are central to all of the key steps of denitrification, an alternative form of respiration in which bacteria reduce nitrate or nitrite to N-2 through the gaseous intermediates nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) when oxygen concentrations are limiting. The one-electron reduction of nitrite to NO, a precursor to N2O, is performed by either a haem-or copper-containing nitrite reductase (CuNiR) where they receive an electron from redox partner proteins a cupredoxin or a c-type cytochrome(4,5). Here we report the structures of the newly characterized three-domain haem-c-Cu nitrite reductase from Ralstonia pickettii (RpNiR) at 1.01 angstrom resolution and its M92A and P93A mutants. Very high resolution provides the first view of the atomic detail of the interface between the core trimeric cupredoxin structure of CuNiR and the tethered cytochrome c domain that allows the enzyme to function as an effective self-electron transfer system where the donor and acceptor proteins are fused together by genomic acquisition for functional advantage. Comparison of RpNiR with the binary complex of a CuNiR with a donor protein, AxNiR-cytc551 (ref. 6), and mutagenesis studies provide direct evidence for the importance of a hydrogen-bonded water at the interface in electron transfer. The structure also provides an explanation for the preferential binding of nitrite to the reduced copper ion at the active site in RpNiR, in contrast to other CuNiRs where reductive inactivation occurs, preventing substrate binding.","[Antonyuk, Svetlana V.; Han, Cong; Eady, Robert R.; Hasnain, S.

Crystallographic analysis clearly determines the absorbed guest structures along with the host frameworks. Because the SCD analysis is carried out on only one tiny crystal of the complex, the required sample mass is of the nanogram-microgram order. We demonstrate that as little as about 80 nanograms of a sample is enough for the SCD analysis. In combination with high-performance liquid chromatography, our protocol allows the direct characterization of multiple fractions, establishing a prototypical means of liquid chromatography SCD analysis.

PrLDs in RNA-binding proteins are essential for the assembly of ribonucleoprotein granules. However, the interplay between human PrLD function and disease is not understood. Here we define pathogenic mutations in PrLDs of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) A2B1 and A1 in families with inherited degeneration affecting muscle, brain, motor neuron and bone, and in one case of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Wild-type hnRNPA2 (the most abundant isoform of hnRNPA2B1) and hnRNPA1 show an intrinsic tendency to assemble into self-seeding fibrils, which is exacerbated by the disease mutations. Indeed, the pathogenic mutations strengthen a 'steric zipper' motif in the PrLD, which accelerates the formation of self-seeding fibrils that cross-seed polymerization of wild-type hnRNP. Notably, the disease mutations promote excess incorporation of hnRNPA2 and hnRNPA1 into stress granules and drive the formation of cytoplasmic inclusions in animal models that recapitulate the human pathology. Thus, dysregulated polymerization caused by a potent mutant steric zipper motif in a PrLD can initiate degenerative disease. Related proteins with PrLDs should therefore be considered candidates for initiating and perhaps propagating proteinopathies of muscle, brain, motor neuron and bone.","[Kim, Hong Joo; Kim, Nam Chul; Moore, Jennifer; Freibaum, Brian; Li, Songqing; Molliex, Amandine; Kanagaraj, Anderson P.; Taylor, J.

However, determining its in vivo function has been elusive. Here we generated kinase-dead Clp1 (Clp1(K/K)) mice that show a progressive loss of spinal motor neurons associated with axonal degeneration in the peripheral nerves and denervation of neuromuscular junctions, resulting in impaired motor function, muscle weakness, paralysis and fatal respiratory failure. Transgenic rescue experiments show that CLP1 functions in motor neurons. Mechanistically, loss of CLP1 activity results in accumulation of a novel set of small RNA fragments, derived from aberrant processing of tyrosine pre-transfer RNA. These tRNA fragments sensitize cells to oxidative-stress-induced p53 (also known as TRP53) activation and p53-dependent cell death. Genetic inactivation of p53 rescues Clp1(K/K) mice from the motor neuron loss, muscle denervation and respiratory failure.

This raises the question of whether stars can form in dense gas without molecules, cooling to the required near-zero temperatures by atomic transitions and dust radiation rather than by molecular line emission(1); and it highlights uncertainties about star formation in the early Universe, when the metallicity was generally low. Here we report the detection of CO in two regions of a local dwarf irregular galaxy, WLM, where the metallicity is 13 per cent of the solar value(2,3). We use new submillimetre observations and archival far-infrared observations to estimate the cloud masses, which are both slightly greater than 100,000 solar masses. The clouds have produced stars at a rate per molecule equal to 10 per cent of that in the local Orion nebula cloud. The CO fraction of the molecular gas is also low, about 3 per cent of the Milky Way value. These results suggest that in small galaxies both star-forming cores and CO molecules become increasingly rare in molecular hydrogen clouds as the metallicity decreases.","[Elmegreen, Bruce G.] TJ Watson Res Ctr, IBM Res Div, Yorktown Hts, NY 10598 USA; [Rubio, Monica; Verdugo, Celia] Univ Chile, Dept Astron, Santiago, Chile; [Hunter, Deidre A.] Lowell Observ, Flagstaff, AZ 86001 USA; [Brinks, Elias] Univ Hertfordshire, Ctr Astrophys Res, Hatfield AL10 9AB, Herts, England; [Schruba, Andreas] CALTECH, Cahill Ctr Astron & Astrophys, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Elmegreen, BG (reprint author), TJ Watson Res Ctr, IBM Res Div, 1101 Kitchawan Rd, Yorktown Hts, NY 10598 USA.",bge@us.ibm.com,"Rubio, Monica/J-3384-2016","Brinks, Elias/0000-0002-7758-9699","US National Science Foundation [AST-0707563, AST-0707426]; CONICYT (FONDECYT) [1080335]; Chilean Center for Astrophysics FONDAP [15010003]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [1177]","This work was funded in part by the US National Science Foundation through grants AST-0707563 and AST-0707426 to D.

The study of this structure could yield critical insights into quantum chemistry(1-3), new methods for manipulating quantum information(4,5), and improved tests of discrete symmetry violation(6,7) and fundamental constant variation(8-10). Harnessing this potential typically requires the preparation of cold molecules in their quantum rovibrational ground state. However, the molecular internal structure severely complicates efforts to produce such samples. Removal of energy stored in long-lived vibrational levels is particularly problematic because optical transitions between vibrational levels are not governed by strict selection rules, which makes laser cooling difficult. Additionally, traditional collisional, or sympathetic, cooling methods are inefficient at quenching molecular vibrational motion(11). Here we experimentally demonstrate that the vibrational motion of trapped BaCl+ molecules is quenched by collisions with ultracold calcium atoms at a rate comparable to the classical scattering, or Langevin, rate. This is over four orders of magnitude more efficient than traditional sympathetic cooling schemes(11). The high cooling rate, a consequence of a strong interaction potential (due to the high polarizability of calcium), along with the low collision energies involved(12), leads to molecular samples with a vibrational ground-state occupancy of at least 90 per cent. Our demonstration uses a novel thermometry technique that relies on relative photodissociation yields. Although the decrease in vibrational temperature is modest, with straightforward improvements it should be possible to produce molecular samples with a vibrational ground-state occupancy greater than 99 per cent in less than 100 milliseconds. Because sympathetic cooling of molecular rotational motion is much more efficient than vibrational cooling in traditional systems, we expect that the method also allows efficient cooling of the rotational motion of the molecules. Moreover, the technique should work for many different combinations of ultracold atoms and molecules.","[Rellergert, Wade G.; Sullivan, Scott T.; Schowalter, Steven J.; Chen, Kuang; Hudson, Eric R.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Phys & Astron, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Kotochigova, Svetlana] Temple Univ, Dept Phys, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA","Rellergert, WG (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Phys & Astron, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",wgr6@ucla.edu,,,"ARO [W911NF-10-1-0505]; US NSF [PHY-1005453, PHY-1205311]; AFOSR [FA 9550-11-1-0243]","This work was supported by ARO grant no.

Early in the most recent deglaciation, a reduction in North Atlantic overturning circulation seems to have driven CO2 release from the Southern Ocean(2-5), but the mechanism connecting the North Atlantic and the Southern Ocean remains unclear. Biogenic opal export in the low-latitude ocean relies on silicate from the underlying thermocline, the concentration of which is affected by the circulation of the ocean interior. Here we report a record of biogenic opal export from a coastal upwelling system off the coast of northwest Africa that shows pronounced opal maxima during each glacial termination over the past 550,000 years. These opal peaks are consistent with a strong deglacial reduction in the formation of silicate-poor glacial North Atlantic intermediate water(2) (GNAIW). The loss of GNAIW allowed mixing with underlying silicate-rich deep water to increase the silicate supply to the surface ocean. An increase in westerly-wind-driven upwelling in the Southern Ocean in response to the North Atlantic change has been proposed to drive the deglacial rise in atmospheric CO2 (refs 3, 4). However, such a circulation change would have accelerated the formation of Antarctic intermediate water and sub-Antarctic mode water, which today have as little silicate as North Atlantic Deep Water and would have thus maintained low silicate concentrations in the Atlantic thermocline. The deglacial opal maxima reported here suggest an alternative mechanism for the deglacial CO2 release(5,6). Just as the reduction in GNAIW led to upward silicate transport, it should also have allowed the downward mixing of warm, low-density surface water to reach into the deep ocean. The resulting decrease in the density of the deep Atlantic relative to the Southern Ocean surface promoted Antarctic overturning, which released CO2 to the atmosphere.","[Meckler, A.

Passive-flow models predict symmetric upwelling due to viscous drag from the diverging tectonic plates, but have been challenged by geophysical observations of asymmetric upwelling(3-5) that suggest anomalous mantle pressure and temperature gradients(2,6,7), and by observations of concentrated upwelling centres(8) consistent with active models where buoyancy forces give rise to focused convective flow(2). Here we use sea-floor magnetotelluric soundings at the fast-spreading northern East Pacific Rise to image mantle electrical structure to a depth of about 160 kilometres. Our data reveal a symmetric, high-conductivity region at depths of 20-90 kilometres that is consistent with partial melting of passively upwelling mantle(9-11). The triangular region of conductive partial melt matches passive-flow predictions, suggesting that melt focusing to the ridge occurs in the porous melting region rather than along the shallower base of the thermal lithosphere. A deeper conductor observed east of the ridge at a depth of more than 100 kilometres is explained by asymmetric upwelling due to viscous coupling across two nearby transform faults. Significant electrical anisotropy occurs only in the shallowest mantle east of the ridge axis, where high vertical conductivity at depths of 10-20 kilometres indicates localized porous conduits. This suggests that a coincident seismic-velocity anomaly(12) is evidence of shallow magma transport channels(13,14) rather than deeper off-axis upwelling. We interpret the mantle electrical structure as evidence that plate-driven passive upwelling dominates this ridge segment, with dynamic forces being negligible.","[Key, Kerry; Constable, Steven] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Inst Geophys & Planetary Phys, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Liu, Lijun] Univ Illinois, Dept Geol, Coll Liberal Arts & Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Pommier, Anne] Arizona State Univ, Sch Earth & Space Explorat, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA","Key, K (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Inst Geophys & Planetary Phys, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",kkey@ucsd.edu,"Constable, Steven/B-8959-2008; Key, Kerry/B-1092-2008",,US NSF [OCE-0241597]; Seafloor Electromagnetic Methods Consortium at Scripps Institution of Oceanography,"We thank the captain and crew of R/V Roger Revelle, members of the scientific party (J.

Together with echinoderms, they comprise the clade Ambulacraria(1). Despite their restricted diversity, hemichordates provide important insights into early deuterostome evolution, notably because of their pharyngeal gill slits(2). Hemichordate phylogeny has long remained problematic(3,4), not least because the nature of any transitional form that might serve to link the anatomically disparate enteropneusts and pterobranchs is conjectural. Hence, inter-relationships have also remained controversial. For example, pterobranchs have sometimes been compared to ancestral echinoderms(1). Molecular data identify enteropneusts as paraphyletic, and harrimaniids(5-8) as the sister group of pterobranchs. Recent molecular phylogenies suggest that enteropneusts are probably basal within hemichordates, contrary to previous views(9), but otherwise provide little guidance as to the nature of the primitive hemichordate(7,8). In addition, the hemichordate fossil record is almost entirely restricted to peridermal skeletons of pterobranchs, notably graptolites(10,11). Owing to their low preservational potentials, fossil enteropneusts are exceedingly rare(12-15), and throw no light on either hemichordate phylogeny or the proposed harrimaniid-pterobranch transition. Here we describe an enteropneust, Spartobranchus tenuis (Walcott, 1911), from the Middle Cambrian-period (Series 3, Stage 5) Burgess Shale. It is remarkably similar to the extant harrimaniids, but differs from all known enteropneusts in that it is associated with a fibrous tube that is sometimes branched. Wesuggest that this is the precursor of the pterobranch periderm, and supports the hypothesis that pterobranchs are miniaturized and derived from an enteropneust-like worm(5,6). It also shows that the periderm was acquired before size reduction and acquisition of feeding tentacles, and that coloniality emerged through aggregation of individuals, perhaps similar to the Cambrian rhabdopleurid Fasciculitubus(11). The presence of both suggests that hemichordates originated at the onset of the Cambrian explosion.","[Caron, Jean-Bernard] Royal Ontario Museum, Dept Nat Hist Palaeobiol, Toronto, ON M5S 2C6, Canada; [Morris, Simon Conway] Univ Cambridge, Dept Earth Sci, Cambridge CB2 3EQ, England; [Cameron, Christopher B.] Univ Montreal, Dept Sci Biol, Montreal, PQ H2V 2S9, Canada","Caron, JB (reprint author), Royal Ontario Museum, Dept Nat Hist Palaeobiol, Toronto, ON M5S 2C6, Canada.",jcaron@rom.on.ca,,"Caron, Jean-Bernard/0000-0002-1670-5502","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council; St John's College, University of Cambridge, UK; Royal Ontario Museum Burgess Shale project [41]","We thank C.

Data indicate that many 'avian' traits were already present in Paraves-the clade that includes birds and their close relatives-and that the early evolution of the modern avian form of reproduction was already well on its way(2,3). Like living neornithine birds, non-avian maniraptorans had daily oviposition and asymmetrical eggs with complex shell microstructure, and were known to protect their clutches(4-6). However, like crocodilians, non-avian maniraptorans had two active oviducts (one present in living birds), relatively smaller eggs, and may not have turned their eggs in the way that living birds do(1,6). Here we report on the first discovery of fossilized mature or nearly mature ovarian follicles, revealing a previously undocumented stage in dinosaur reproduction: reproductively active females near ovulation. Preserved in a specimen of the long bony-tailed Jeholornis and two enantiornithine birds from the Early Cretaceous period lacustrine Jehol Biota in northeastern China, these discoveries indicate that basal birds only had one functional ovary, but retained primitive morphologies as a result of their lower metabolic rate relative to living birds. They also indicate that basal birds reached sexual maturity before skeletal maturity, as in crocodiles and paravian dinosaurs. Differences in follicular morphology between Jeholornis and the enantiornithines are interpreted as forming an evolutionary gradient from the reproductive condition in paravian dinosaurs towards neornithine birds. Furthermore, differences between the two enantiornithines indicate that this lineage might also have evolved advanced reproductive traits in parallel to the neornithine lineage.","[Zheng, Xiaoting; Wang, Xiaoli; Wang, Yan] Linyi Univ, Inst Geol & Paleontol, Linyi 276000, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Xiaoting] Tianyu Nat Hist Museum Shandong, Pingyi 273300, Shandong, Peoples R China; [O'Connor, Jingmai; Wang, Min; Zhou, Zhonghe] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Vertebrate Evolut & Human Origin, Inst Vertebrate Paleontol & Paleoanthropol, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [Huchzermeyer, Fritz] Univ Pretoria, Fac Vet Sci, Dept Paraclin Sci, ZA-0110 Onderstepoort, South Africa","O'Connor, J (reprint author), Linyi Univ, Inst Geol & Paleontol, Linyi 276000, Shandong, Peoples R China.",jingmai.oconnor@gmail.com; zhouzhonghe@ivpp.ac.cn,,"Wang, Min/0000-0001-8506-1213",National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) [2012CB821906]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41172020]; Chinese Academy of Sciences,"The specimens reported here are deposited in the Tianyu Natural History Museum, Shandong, China.

Most genes in bacteria are encoded on the leading strand of replication(1-4). This presumably avoids the potentially detrimental head-on collisions that occur between the replication and transcription machineries when genes are encoded on the lagging strand(1-4). Here we identify the ubiquitous (core) genes in Bacillus subtilis and determine that 17% of them are on the lagging strand. We find a higher rate of point mutations in the core genes on the lagging strand compared with those on the leading strand, with this difference being primarily in the amino-acid-changing (nonsynonymous) mutations. We determine that, overall, the genes under strong negative selection against amino-acid-changing mutations tend to be on the leading strand, co-oriented with replication. In contrast, on the basis of the rate of convergent mutations, genes under positive selection for amino-acid-changing mutations are more commonly found on the lagging strand, indicating faster adaptive evolution in many genes in the head-on orientation. Increased gene length and gene expression amounts are positively correlated with the rate of accumulation of nonsynonymous mutations in the head-on genes, suggesting that the conflict between replication and transcription could be a driving force behind these mutations. Indeed, using reversion assays, we show that the difference in the rate of mutagenesis of genes in the two orientations is transcription dependent. Altogether, our findings indicate that head-on replication-transcription conflicts are more mutagenic than co-directional conflicts and that these encounters can significantly increase adaptive structural variation in the coded proteins. We propose that bacteria, and potentially other organisms, promote faster evolution of specific genes through orientation-dependent encounters between DNA replication and transcription.","[Paul, Sandip; Million-Weaver, Samuel; Chattopadhyay, Sujay; Sokurenko, Evgeni; Merrikh, Houra] Univ Washington, Dept Microbiol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Sokurenko, E (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Microbiol, Hlth Sci Bldg J Wing, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",evs@u.washington.edu; merrikh@uw.edu,,"Million-Weaver, Samuel/0000-0001-9057-6326","Department of Microbiology at the University of Washington; University of Washington Biophysics Training Grant; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [RC4 AI092828, R01 GM084318]","We acknowledge the work of others that has contributed to our understanding of the topic, which we were unable to cite here.

ES-cell identity is maintained by a core of factors including Oct4 (also known as Pou5f1), Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc (OSKM) and Nanog(2-4), and forced expression of the OSKM factors can reprogram somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) resembling ES cells(5,6). These gene-specific factors for RNA-polymerase-II-mediated transcription recruit transcriptional cofactors and chromatin regulators that control access to and activity of the basal transcription machinery on gene promoters(7,8). How the basal transcription machinery is involved in setting and maintaining the pluripotent state is unclear. Here we show that knockdown of the transcription factor IID (TFIID) complex affects the pluripotent circuitry in mouse ES cells and inhibits reprogramming of fibroblasts. TFIID subunits and the OSKM factors forma feed-forward loop to induce and maintain a stable transcription state. Notably, transient expression of TFIID subunits greatly enhanced reprogramming. These results show that TFIID is critical for transcription-factor-mediated reprogramming. We anticipate that, by creating plasticity in gene expression programs, transcription complexes such as TFIID assist reprogramming into different cellular states.","[Pijnappel, W. W. M.

On invasion of insect larvae, P. luminescens is released from the nematodes and kills the insect through the action of a variety of virulence factors including large tripartite ABC-type toxin complexes(2) (Tcs). Tcs are typically composed of TcA, TcB and TcC proteins and are biologically active only when complete(3-5). Functioning as ADP-ribosyltransferases, TcC proteins were identified as the actual functional components that induce actin-clustering, defects in phagocytosis and cell death(5-7). However, little is known about the translocation of TcC into the cell by the TcA and TcB components. Here we show that TcA in P. luminescens (TcdA1) forms a transmembrane pore and report its structure in the prepore and pore state determined by cryoelectron microscopy. We find that the TcdA1 prepore assembles as a pentamer forming an alpha-helical, vuvuzela-shaped channel less than 1.5 nanometres in diameter surrounded by a large outer shell. Membrane insertion is triggered not only at low pH as expected, but also at high pH, explaining Tc action directly through the midgut of insects(8). Comparisons with structures of the TcdA1 pore inserted into a membrane and in complex with TcdB2 and TccC3 reveal large conformational changes during membrane insertion, suggesting a novel syringe-like mechanism of protein translocation. Our results demonstrate how ABC-type toxin complexes bridge a membrane to insert their lethal components into the cytoplasm of the host cell. We believe that the proposed mechanism is characteristic of the whole ABC-type toxin family. This explanation of toxin translocation is a step towards understanding the host-pathogen interaction and the complex life cycle of P. luminescens and other pathogens, including human pathogenic bacteria, and serves as a strong foundation for the development of biopesticides.","[Gatsogiannis, Christos; Meusch, Dominic; Hofnagel, Oliver; Raunser, Stefan] Max Planck Inst Mol Physiol, Dept Phys Biochem, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany; [Lang, Alexander E.; Pfaumann, Vanda; Aktories, Klaus] Univ Freiburg, Inst Expt & Klin Pharmakol & Toxik, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Benz, Roland] Jacobs Univ Bremen, Sch Engn & Sci, D-28759 Bremen, Germany","Raunser, S (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Mol Physiol, Dept Phys Biochem, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany.",stefan.raunser@mpi-dortmund.mpg.de,"Gatsogiannis, Christos/G-4433-2011","Raunser, Stefan/0000-0001-9373-3016; Benz, Roland/0000-0002-9510-9265","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [RA 1781/1-1, AK 6/22-1]; Max Planck Society",We are grateful to R.

Whereas M1 macrophages are proinflammatory and have a central role in host defence against bacterial and viral infections(4,5), M2 macrophages are associated with responses to anti-inflammatory reactions, helminth infection, tissue remodelling, fibrosis and tumour progression(6). Trib1 is an adaptor protein involved in protein degradation by interacting with COP1 ubiquitin ligase(7). Genome-wide association studies in humans have implicated TRIB1 in lipid metabolism(8-10). Here we show that Trib1 is critical for the differentiation of F4/80(+)MR(+) tissue-resident macrophages-that share characteristics with M2 macrophages (which we term M2-like macrophages)-and eosinophils but not for the differentiation of M1 myeloid cells. Trib1 deficiency results in a severe reduction of M2-like macrophages in various organs, including bone marrow, spleen, lung and adipose tissues. Aberrant expression of C/EBP alpha in Trib1-deficient bone marrow cells is responsible for the defects in macrophage differentiation. Unexpectedly, mice lacking Trib1 in haematopoietic cells show diminished adipose tissue mass accompanied by evidence of increased lipolysis, even when fed a normal diet. Supplementation of M2-like macrophages rescues the pathophysiology, indicating that a lack of these macrophages is the cause of lipolysis. In response to a high-fat diet, mice lacking Trib1 in haematopoietic cells develop hypertriglyceridaemia and insulin resistance, together with increased proinflammatory cytokine gene induction. Collectively, these results demonstrate that Trib1 is critical for adipose tissue maintenance and suppression of metabolic disorders by controlling the differentiation of tissue-resident M2-like macrophages.","[Satoh, Takashi; Takemura, Naoki; Nakagawa, Katsuhiro; Takeuchi, Osamu; Akira, Shizuo] Osaka Univ, Lab Host Def, WPI Immunol Frontier Res Ctr WPI IFReC, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Satoh, Takashi; Takemura, Naoki; Nakagawa, Katsuhiro; Takeuchi, Osamu; Akira, Shizuo] Osaka Univ, Dept Host Def, Microbial Dis Res Inst, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Kidoya, Hiroyasu; Naito, Hisamichi; Takakura, Nobuyuki] Osaka Univ, Dept Signal Transduct, Microbial Dis Res Inst, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Yamamoto, Masahiro] Osaka Univ, Lab Immunoparasitol, WPI Immunol Frontier Res Ctr WPI IFReC, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Yamamoto, Masahiro] Osaka Univ, Dept Immunoparasitol, Microbial Dis Res Inst, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Yoshioka, Yoshichika] Osaka Univ, Lab Biofunct Imaging, WPI Immunol Frontier Res Ctr WPI IFReC, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Morii, Eiichi] Osaka Univ, Dept Pathol, Grad Sch Med, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Takeuchi, Osamu] Kyoto Univ, Lab Infect & Prevent, Inst Virus Res, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068507, Japan","Akira, S (reprint author), Osaka Univ, Lab Host Def, WPI Immunol Frontier Res Ctr WPI IFReC, 3-1 Yamada Oka, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan.",sakira@biken.osaka-u.ac.jp,"Akira, Shizuo/C-3134-2009",,"Special Coordination Funds of the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology; Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science through the Funding Program for World-Leading Innovative R&D on Science and Technology (FIRST Program)","We thank I.

By localized upregulation of clathrin-dependent endocytosis(7) at cortical microtubule- and clathrin-rich domains orthogonal to the axis of polarity, PINOID accelerates the removal of auxin transporter PIN proteins(8-10) from those sites. This mechanism links directional microtubule organization to the polar localization of auxin transporter PIN proteins, and clarifies how microtubule-enriched cell sides are kept distinct from polar delivery domains.

Evidence supporting this traditional view is based on analytical methods that provide limited or no subcellular resolution(1). It has been subsequently proposed that signalling by internalized GPCRs is restricted to G-protein-independent mechanisms such as scaffolding by arrestins(2,3), or GPCR activation elicits a discrete formof persistent G protein signalling(4-9), or that internalized GPCRs can indeed contribute to the acute G-protein-mediated response(10). Evidence supporting these various latter hypotheses is indirect or subject to alternative interpretation, and it remains unknown if endosome-localized GPCRs are even present in an active form. Here we describe the application of conformation-specific single-domain antibodies (nanobodies) to directly probe activation of the beta(2)-adrenoceptor, a prototypical GPCR(11), and its cognate G protein, G(s) (ref. 12), in living mammalian cells. We show that the adrenergic agonist isoprenaline promotes receptor and G protein activation in the plasma membrane as expected, but also in the early endosome membrane, and that internalized receptors contribute to the overall cellular cyclic AMP response within several minutes after agonist application. These findings provide direct support for the hypothesis that canonical GPCR signalling occurs from endosomes as well as the plasma membrane, and suggest a versatile strategy for probing dynamic conformational change in vivo.","[Irannejad, Roshanak; Tomshine, Jin C.; Tomshine, Jon R.; von Zastrow, Mark] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Psychiat, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Chevalier, Michael; El-Samad, Hana; Huang, Bo] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem & Biophys, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Mahoney, Jacob P.; Sunahara, Roger K.] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Steyaert, Jan] Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Mol & Cellular Interact, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Steyaert, Jan] VIB, Struct Biol Res Ctr, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Rasmussen, Soren G.

Production of fluent speech requires the precise, coordinated movement of multiple articulators (for example, the lips, jaw, tongue and larynx) over rapid time scales. Here we used high-resolution, multi-electrode cortical recordings during the production of consonant-vowel syllables to determine the organization of speech sensorimotor cortex in humans. We found speech-articulator representations that are arranged somatotopically on ventral pre- and post-central gyri, and that partially overlap at individual electrodes. These representations were coordinated temporally as sequences during syllable production. Spatial patterns of cortical activity showed an emergent, population-level representation, which was organized by phonetic features. Over tens of milliseconds, the spatial patterns transitioned between distinct representations for different consonants and vowels. These results reveal the dynamic organization of speech sensorimotor cortex during the generation of multi-articulator movements that underlies our ability to speak.","[Bouchard, Kristofer E.; Mesgarani, Nima; Chang, Edward F.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Neurol Surg, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Bouchard, Kristofer E.; Mesgarani, Nima; Chang, Edward F.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Physiol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Bouchard, Kristofer E.; Mesgarani, Nima; Chang, Edward F.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Ctr Integrat Neurosci, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Johnson, Keith] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Linguist, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Chang, Edward F.] Univ Calif San Francisco, UCSF Epilepsy Ctr, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Chang, EF (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Neurol Surg, 505 Parnassus Ave, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",ChangEd@neurosurg.ucsf.edu,,,"US National Institutes of Health [R00-NS065120, DP2-OD00862, R01-DC012379]; Ester A. and Joseph Klingenstein Foundation","We thank A.

To explore circRNAs systematically, we sequenced and computationally analysed human, mouse and nematode RNA. We detected thousands of well-expressed, stable circRNAs, often showing tissue/developmental-stage-specific expression. Sequence analysis indicated important regulatory functions for circRNAs. We found that a human circRNA, antisense to the cerebellar degeneration-related protein 1 transcript (CDR1as), is densely bound by microRNA (miRNA) effector complexes and harbours 63 conserved binding sites for the ancient miRNA miR-7. Further analyses indicated that CDR1as functions to bind miR-7 in neuronal tissues. Human CDR1as expression in zebrafish impaired midbrain development, similar to knocking down miR-7, suggesting that CDR1as is a miRNA antagonist with a miRNA-binding capacity ten times higher than any other known transcript. Together, our data provide evidence that circRNAs form a large class of post-transcriptional regulators. Numerous circRNAs form by head-to-tail splicing of exons, suggesting previously unrecognized regulatory potential of coding sequences.","[Memczak, Sebastian; Jens, Marvin; Elefsinioti, Antigoni; Torti, Francesca; Krueger, Janna; Rybak, Agnieszka; Maier, Luisa; Mackowiak, Sebastian D.; Gregersen, Lea H.; Munschauer, Mathias; Loewer, Alexander; Ziebold, Ulrike; Landthaler, Markus; Kocks, Christine; le Noble, Ferdinand; Rajewsky, Nikolaus] Max Delbruck Ctr Mol Med, D-13125 Berlin, Germany","Rajewsky, N (reprint author), Max Delbruck Ctr Mol Med, Robert Rossle Str 10, D-13125 Berlin, Germany.",rajewsky@mdc-berlin.de,"Landthaler, Markus/A-1427-2010; Ziebold, Ulrike/N-4487-2013; le Noble, Ferdinand/L-7867-2017; Mackowiak, Sebastian/S-3266-2017","Landthaler, Markus/0000-0002-1075-8734; Jens, Marvin/0000-0002-6660-8743; Loewer, Alexander/0000-0002-8819-3040; Memczak, Sebastian/0000-0001-9518-7135","Max-Delbruck-Center (MDC); MDC-NYU; BMBF [1210182]; DFG [KFO218]; Helmholtz Association for the 'MDC Systems Biology Network', MSBN; BMBF support for the DZHK; Center for Stroke Research Berlin; BMBF for the Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology [0315362C]","We thank M.

The origin recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6 and Cdt1 load Mcm2-7 into a double hexamer bound around duplex DNA in an ATP-dependent reaction, but the molecular mechanism of this origin 'licensing' is still poorly understood. Here we show that both Mcm2-7 hexamers in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are recruited to origins by an essential, conserved carboxy-terminal domain of Mcm3 that interacts with and stimulates the ATPase activity of ORC-Cdc6. ATP hydrolysis can promote Mcm2-7 loading, but can also promote Mcm2-7 release if components are missing or if ORC has been inactivated by cyclin-dependent kinase phosphorylation. Our work provides new insights into how origins are licensed and reveals a novel ATPase-dependent mechanism contributing to precise once per cell cycle replication.","[Frigola, Jordi; Remus, Dirk; Mehanna, Amina; Diffley, John F.

It has, however, been difficult to measure the complete redshift distribution of these objects, especially at the highest redshifts (z>4). Here we report a redshift survey at a wavelength of three millimetres, targeting carbon monoxide line emission from the star-forming molecular gas in the direction of extraordinarily bright millimetre-wave-selected sources. High-resolution imaging demonstrates that these sources are strongly gravitationally lensed by foreground galaxies. We detect spectral lines in 23 out of 26 sources and multiple lines in 12 of those 23 sources, from which we obtain robust, unambiguous redshifts. At least 10 of the sources are found to lie at z > 4, indicating that the fraction of dusty starburst galaxies at high redshifts is greater than previously thought. Models of lens geometries in the sample indicate that the background objects are ultra-luminous infrared galaxies, powered by extreme bursts of star formation.","[Vieira, J. D.; Bock, J.

They provide a 3D stereoscopic experience to many viewers at the same time with full motion parallax and do not require special glasses or eye tracking. None of the leading multiview 3D solutions is particularly well suited to mobile devices (watches, mobile phones or tablets), which require the combination of a thin, portable form factor, a high spatial resolution and a wide full-parallax view zone (for short viewing distance from potentially steep angles). Here we introduce a multi-directional diffractive backlight technology that permits the rendering of high-resolution, full-parallax 3D images in a very wide view zone (up to 180 degrees in principle) at an observation distance of up to a metre. The key to our design is a guided-wave illumination technique based on light-emitting diodes that produces wide-angle multiview images in colour from a thin planar transparent light-guide. Pixels associated with different views or colours are spatially multiplexed and can be independently addressed and modulated at video rate using an external shutter plane.

Yet little is known about the capacity of the biosphere to buffer increased nitrogen influx. Past changes in global ecosystems following deglaciation at the end of the Pleistocene epoch provide an opportunity to understand better how nitrogen cycling in the terrestrial biosphere responded to changes in carbon cycling. We analysed published records of stable nitrogen isotopic values (delta N-15) in sediments from 86 lakes on six continents. Here we show that the value of sedimentary delta N-15 declined from 15,000 years before present to 7,056 +/- 597 years before present, a period of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and terrestrial carbon accumulation(2). Comparison of the nitrogen isotope record with concomitant carbon accumulation on land and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere suggests millennia of declining nitrogen availability in terrestrial ecosystems during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition around 11,000 years before present. In contrast, we do not observe a consistent change in global sedimentary delta N-15 values during the past 500 years, despite the potential effects of changing temperature and nitrogen influx from anthropogenic sources. We propose that the lack of a single response may indicate that modern increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide and net carbon sequestration in the biosphere have the potential to offset recent increased supplies of reactive nitrogen in some ecosystems.","[McLauchlan, Kendra K.; Williams, Joseph J.] Kansas State Univ, Dept Geog, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Craine, Joseph M.] Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Jeffers, Elizabeth S.] Univ Oxford, Biodivers Inst, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England","McLauchlan, KK (reprint author), Kansas State Univ, Dept Geog, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",mclauch@ksu.edu,,"Jeffers, Elizabeth/0000-0001-9679-5909; Williams, Joseph/0000-0003-4521-4902; Craine, Joseph/0000-0001-6561-3244","National Science Foundation [BCS-0955225, EPS-0903806]; James Martin Fellowship at the University of Oxford","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation (BCS-0955225 and EPS-0903806) and a James Martin Fellowship at the University of Oxford.

Although a viscosity decrease beneath this boundary is essential for plate tectonics, a consensus on its origin remains elusive. Seismic studies identify a prominent velocity discontinuity at depths thought to coincide with the LAB but disagree on its cause(1-5), generally invoking either partial melting(6) or a mantle dehydration boundary(7) as explanations. Here we use sea-floor magnetotelluric data to image the electrical conductivity of the LAB beneath the edge of the Cocos plate at the Middle America trench offshore of Nicaragua. Underneath the resistive oceanic lithosphere, the magnetotelluric data reveal a high-conductivity layer confined to depths of 45 to 70 kilometres. Because partial melts are stable at these depths in a warm damp mantle(8), we interpret the conductor to be a partially molten layer capped by an impermeable frozen lid that is the base of the lithosphere. A conductivity anisotropy parallel to plate motion indicates that this melt has been sheared into flow-aligned tube-like structures(9). We infer that the LAB beneath young plates consists of a thin, partially molten, channel of low viscosity that acts to decouple the overlying brittle lithosphere from the deeper convecting mantle. Because this boundary layer has the potential to behave as a lubricant to plate motion, its proximity to the trench may have implications for subduction dynamics.","[Naif, S.; Key, K.; Constable, S.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Inst Geophys & Planetary Phys, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Evans, R.

Here we conduct whole-genome resequencimg of dogs and wolves to identify 3.8 million genetic variants used to identify 36 genomic regions that probably represent targets for selection during dog domestication. Nineteen of these regions contain genes important in brain function, eight of which belong to nervous system development pathways and potentially underlie behavioural changes central to dog domestication(6). Ten genes with key roles in starch digestion and fat metabolism also show signals of selection. We identify candidate mutations in key genes and provide functional support for an increased starch digestion in dogs relative to wolves.

Long-term repopulating HSCs reside in several, perhaps overlapping, niches that produce regulatory molecules and signals necessary for homeostasis and for increased output after stress or injury(1-5). Despite considerable advances in the specific cellular or molecular mechanisms governing HSC-niche interactions, little is known about the regulatory function in the intact mammalian haematopoietic niche. Recently, we and others described a positive regulatory role for prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)) on HSC function ex vivo(6,7). Here we show that inhibition of endogenous PGE(2) by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) treatment in mice results in modest HSC egress from the bone marrow. Surprisingly, this was independent of the SDF-1-CXCR4 axis implicated in stem-cell migration. Stem and progenitor cells were found to have differing mechanisms of egress, with HSC transit to the periphery dependent on niche attenuation and reduction in the retentive molecule osteopontin. Haematopoietic grafts mobilized with NSAIDs had superior repopulating ability and long-term engraftment. Treatment of non-human primates and healthy human volunteers confirmed NSAID-mediated egress in other species. PGE(2) receptor knockout mice demonstrated that progenitor expansion and stem/progenitor egress resulted from reduced E-prostanoid 4 (EP4) receptor signalling. These results not only uncover unique regulatory roles for EP4 signalling in HSC retention in the niche, but also define a rapidly translatable strategy to enhance transplantation therapeutically.","[Hoggatt, Jonathan; Mohammad, Khalid S.; Singh, Pratibha; Hoggatt, Amber F.; Speth, Jennifer M.; Hu, Peirong; Stilger, Kayla N.; Czader, Magdalena; Serezani, Carlos H.; Guise, Theresa A.; Srour, Edward F.; Pelus, Louis M.] Indiana Univ Sch Med, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Hoggatt, Jonathan; Ferraro, Francesca; Silberstein, Lev; Wong, Frankie K.; Scadden, David T.] Harvard Univ, Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Harvard Med Sch, Ctr Regenerat Med,Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Hoggatt, Amber F.] Univ Illinois, Biol Resources Lab, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; [Chitteti, Brahmananda R.; Poteat, Bradley A.; Farag, Sherif S.; Srour, Edward F.] Indiana Univ Sch Med, Div Hematol & Oncol, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Milne, Ginger L.] Vanderbilt Univ, Div Clin Pharmacol, Eicosanoid Core Lab, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [Breyer, Richard M.] Vanderbilt Univ, Div Nephrol & Hypertens, Nashville, TN 37232 USA","Pelus, LM (reprint author), Indiana Univ Sch Med, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA.",lpelus@iupui.edu,"Milne, Ginger/D-7648-2014","Milne, Ginger/0000-0003-3890-151X; serezani, carlos/0000-0002-5363-415X","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [HL096305, CA143057, CA069158, HL100402, DK37097]; NIH [DK07519, HL07910, HL087735]; Center of Excellence in Hematology [P01 DK090948]","These studies were supported by National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants HL096305 (L.M.P.), CA143057, CA069158 (T.A.G., K.S.M.), HL100402 (D.T.S.) and DK37097 (R.M.B.).

Whereas the genomic occupancy of NANOG has been extensively investigated, comparatively little is known about NANOG-associated proteins(5) and their contribution to the NANOG-mediated reprogramming process. Using enhanced purification techniques and a stringent computational algorithm, we identify 27 high-confidence protein interaction partners of NANOG in mouse embryonic stem cells. These consist of 19 previously unknown partners of NANOG that have not been reported before, including the ten-eleven translocation (TET) family methylcytosine hydroxylase TET1. We confirm physical association of NANOG with TET1, and demonstrate that TET1, in synergy with NANO G, enhances the efficiency of reprogramming. We also find physical associatinn and reprogramming synergy of TET2 with NANOG, and demonstrate that knockdown of TET2 abolishes the reprogramming synergy of NANOG with a catalytically deficient mutant of TET1. These results indicate that the physical interaction between NANOG and TET1/TET2 proteins facilitates reprogramming in a manner that is dependent on the catalytic activity of TET1/TET2. TET1 and NANOG co-occupy genomic loci of genes associated with both maintenance of pluripotency and lineage commitment in embryonic stem cells, and TET1 binding is reduced upon NANOG depletion. Co-expression of NANOG and TET1 increases 5-hydroxymethylcytosine levels at the top-ranked common target loci Esrrb and Oct4 (also called Pou5f1), resulting in priming of their expression before reprogramming to naive pluripotency. We propose that TET1 is recruited by NANOG to enhance the expression of a subset of key reprogramming target genes. These results provide an insight into the reprogramming mechanism of NANOG and uncover a new role for 5-methykytosine hydroxylases in the establishment of naive pluripotency.","[Costa, Yael; Theunissen, Thorold W.; Lawrence, Moyra; Dietmann, Sabine; Silva, Jose C.

Similarly, each individual is comprised of a variety of bones of differing lengths. The largest contribution to the lengthening of a skeletal element, and to the differential elongation of elements, comes from a dramatic increase in the volume of hypertrophic chondrocytes in the growth plate as they undergo terminal differentiation(1-7). However, the mechanisms of chondrocyte volume enlargement have remained a mystery(8-11). Here we use quantitative phase microscopy(12) to show that mammalian chondrocytes undergo three distinct phases of volume increase, including a phase of massive cell swelling in which the cellular dry mass is significantly diluted. In light of the tight fluid regulatory mechanisms known to control volume in many cell types(13), this is a remarkable mechanism for increasing cell size and. regulating growth rate. It is, however, the duration of the final phase of volume enlargement by proportional dry mass increase at low density that varies most between rapidly and slowly elongating growth plates. Moreover, we find that this third phase is locally regulated through a mechanism dependent on insulin-like growth factor. This study provides a framework for understanding how skeletal size is regulated and for exploring how cells sense, modify and establish a volume set point.","[Cooper, Kimberly L.; Tabin, Clifford J.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Oh, Seungeun; Kirschner, Marc W.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Sung, Yongjin; Dasari, Ramachandra R.] MIT, George R Harrison Spect Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Cooper, KL (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",kcooper@genetics.med.harvard.edu,,"Sung, Yongjin/0000-0001-6371-8771","NIH [P01DK056246, R01GM026875, P41RR02594]; National Science Foundation (NSF) [DBI0754339]; Hamamatsu Corporation","We would like to thank T.

Here we use mouse models to provide evidence for a systemically active regulatory mechanism that controls whole-body BAT activity for thermoregulation and energy homeostasis. Genetic ablation of the type 1A BMP receptor (Bmpr1a) in brown adipogenic progenitor cells leads to a severe paucity of cBAT. This in turn increases sympathetic input to WAT, thereby promoting the formation of rBAT within white fat depots. This previously unknown compensatory mechanism, aimed at restoring total brown-fat-mediated thermogenic capacity in the body, is sufficient to maintain normal temperature homeostasis and resistance to diet-induced obesity. These data suggest an important physiological cross-talk between constitutive and recruitable brown fat cells. This sophisticated regulatory mechanism of body temperature may participate in the control of energy balance and metabolic disease.","[Schulz, Tim J.; Huang, Tian Lian; Xue, Ruidan; McDougall, Lindsay E.; Townsend, Kristy L.; Cypess, Aaron M.; Tseng, Yu-Hua] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Joslin Diabet Ctr, Sect Integrat Physiol & Metab, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Huang, Ping; Gussoni, Emanuela] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston Childrens Hosp, Program Genom, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Huang, Ping; Gussoni, Emanuela] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston Childrens Hosp, Div Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Xue, Ruidan] Fudan Univ, Shanghai Med Coll, Huashan Hosp, Div Endocrinol & Metab, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China; [Mishina, Yuji] Univ Michigan, Sch Dent, Dept Biol & Mat Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Tseng, Yu-Hua] Harvard Univ, Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Tseng, YH (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Joslin Diabet Ctr, Sect Integrat Physiol & Metab, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",yu-hua.tseng@joslin.harvard.edu,"Schulz, Tim/F-4842-2013","Schulz, Tim/0000-0002-8413-3972; Gussoni, Emanuela/0000-0002-9915-3677","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R01 DK077097]; Joslin Diabetes Center's Diabetes Research Center (DRC from the NIDDK) [P30 DK036836]; Eli Lilly Research Foundation; Harvard Stem Cell Institute; Mary K.

Recently, miRNA activity has been shown to be affected by the presence of miRNA sponge transcripts, the so-called competing endogenous RNA in humans and target mimicry in plants(2-7). We previously identified a highly expressed circular RNA (circRNA) in human and mouse brain(8). Here we show that this circRNA acts as a miR-7 sponge; we term this circular transcript ciRS-7 (circular RNA sponge for miR-7). ciRS-7 contains more than 70 selectively conserved miRNA target sites, and it is highly and widely associated with Argonaute (AGO) proteins in a miR-7-dependent manner. Although the circRNA is completely resistant to miRNA-mediated target destabilization, it strongly suppresses miR-7 activity, resulting in increased levels of miR-7 targets. In the mouse brain, we observe overlapping co-expression of ciRS-7 and miR-7, particularly in neocortical and hippocampal neurons, suggesting a high degree of endogenous interaction. We further show that the testis-specific circRNA, sex-determining region Y (Sry)(9), serves as a miR-138 sponge, suggesting that miRNA sponge effects achieved by circRNA formation are a general phenomenon. This study serves as the first, to our knowledge, functional analysis of a naturally expressed circRNA.","[Hansen, Thomas B.; Jensen, Trine I.; Bramsen, Jesper B.; Damgaard, Christian K.; Kjems, Jorgen] Aarhus Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Clausen, Bettina H.; Finsen, Bente] Univ Southern Denmark, Inst Mol Med, DK-5000 Odense C, Denmark; [Bramsen, Jesper B.; Kjems, Jorgen] Aarhus Univ, Interdisciplinary Nanosci Ctr iNANO, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark","Kjems, J (reprint author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, CF Mollers Alle 3, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",tbh@mb.au.dk; jk@mb.au.dk,,"Hansen, Thomas/0000-0002-7573-9657; Clausen, Bettina Hjelm/0000-0003-3302-2022; Finsen, Bente /0000-0002-8323-9329",SIROCCO EU consortium; Lundbeck Foundation; Danish Council for Independent Research - Natural Sciences,"We thank C.

Autophagy is initiated by isolation membranes, which form and elongate as they engulf portions of the cytoplasm and organelles. Eventually isolation membranes dose to form double membrane-bound autophagosomes and fuse with lysosomes to degrade their contents. The physiological role of autophagy has been determined since its discovery, but the origin of autophagosomal membranes has remained unclear. At present, there is much controversy about the organelle from which the membranes originate-the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria and plasma membrane(1,2). Here we show that autophagosomes form at the ER-mitochondria contact site in mammalian cells. Imaging data reveal that the pre-autophagosome/autophagosome marker ATG14 (also known as ATG14L) relocalizes to the ER-mitochondria contact site after starvation, and the autophagosome-formation marker ATG5 also localizes at the site until formation is complete. Subcellular fractionation showed that ATG14 co-fractionates in the mitochondria-associated ER membrane(3-5) fraction under starvation conditions. Disruption of the ER-mitochondria contact site prevents the formation of ATG14 puncta. The ER-resident SNARE protein syntaxin 17 (STX17) binds ATG14 and recruits it to the ER-mitochondria contact site. These results provide new insight into organelle biogenesis by demonstrating that the ER-mitochondria contact site is important in autophagosome formation.","[Hamasaki, Maho; Nezu, Akiko; Fujita, Naonobu; Noda, Takeshi; Yoshimori, Tamotsu] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Genet, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Hamasaki, Maho; Nezu, Akiko; Fujita, Naonobu; Noda, Takeshi; Yoshimori, Tamotsu] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Frontier Biosci, Lab Intracellular Membrane Dynam, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Furuta, Nobumichi; Amano, Atsuo] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Dent, Ctr Oral Frontier Sci, Dept Oral Frontier Biol, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Matsuda, Atsushi; Haraguchi, Tokuko; Hiraoka, Yasushi] Natl Inst Informat & Commun Technol, Nishi Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6512492, Japan; [Matsuda, Atsushi; Haraguchi, Tokuko; Hiraoka, Yasushi] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Frontier Biosci, Nucl Dynam Grp, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Yamamoto, Akitsugu] Nagahama Inst Biosci & Technol, Fac Biosci, Dept Cell Biol, Nagahama, Shiga 5260829, Japan; [Oomori, Hiroko] Osaka Univ, Res Inst Microbial Dis, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Amano, Atsuo] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Dent, Dept Prevent Dent, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan","Yoshimori, T (reprint author), Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Genet, 2-2 Yaniadaoka, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan.",amanoa@dent.osaka-u.ac.jp; tamyoshi@fbs.osaka-u.ac.jp,"Noda, Takeshi/B-7240-2008; Hiraoka, Yasushi/B-5111-2009; Yoshimori, Tamotsu/K-9626-2014","Noda, Takeshi/0000-0003-3581-7961; Hiraoka, Yasushi/0000-0001-9407-8228; Yoshimori, Tamotsu/0000-0001-9787-3788","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan","We thank all members of the Amano and Yoshimori laboratories for discussions.

HNF-4 alpha is the most abundant DNA-binding protein in the liver, where some 40% of the actively transcribed genes have a HNF-4 alpha response element(1,3,4). These regulated genes are largely involved in the hepatic gluconeogenic program and lipid metabolism(3,5,6). In the pancreas HNF-4 alpha is also a master regulator, controlling an estimated 11% of islet genes(7). HNF-4 alpha protein mutations are linked to maturity-onset diabetes of the young, type 1 (MODY1) and hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia(8-11). Previous structural analyses of NRs, although productive in elucidating the structure of individual domains, have lagged behind in revealing the connectivity patterns of NR domains. Here we describe the 2.9 angstrom crystal structure of the multidomain human HNF-4 alpha homodimer bound to its DNA response element and coactivatorderived peptides. A convergence zone connects multiple receptor domains in an asymmetric fashion, joining distinct elements from each monomer. An arginine target of PRMT1 methylation protrudes directly into this convergence zone and sustains its integrity. A serine target of protein kinase C is also responsible for maintaining domain-domain interactions. These post-translational modifications lead to changes in DNA binding by communicating through the tightly connected surfaces of the quaternary fold. We find that some MODY1 mutations, positioned on the ligand-binding domain and hinge regions of the receptor, compromise DNA binding at a distance by communicating through the interjunctional surfaces of the complex. The overall domain representation of the HNF-4 alpha homodimer is different from that of the PPAR-gamma-RXR-alpha heterodimer, even when both NR complexes are assembled on the same DNA element. Our findings suggest that unique quaternary folds and interdomain connections in NRs could be exploited by small-molecule allosteric modulators that affect distal functions in these polypeptides.","[Chandra, Vikas; Huang, Pengxiang; Potluri, Nalini; Wu, Dalei; Rastinejad, Fraydoon] Sanford Burnham Med Res Inst, Metab Signaling & Dis Program, Orlando, FL 32827 USA; [Kim, Youngchang] Argonne Natl Lab, Struct Biol Ctr, Biosci Div, Argonne, IL 60439 USA","Rastinejad, F (reprint author), Sanford Burnham Med Res Inst, Metab Signaling & Dis Program, Orlando, FL 32827 USA.",frastinejad@sanfordburnham.org,,,"National Institutes of Health [R01 DK094147, R01 DK097475]",This work was supported by National Institutes of Health grants R01 DK094147 and R01 DK097475.,,28,63,67,0,37,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,21-Mar,2013,495,7441,,,,,394,398,,10.1038/nature11966,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,113EY,WOS:000316650500048,23485969.0,No,,,11/20/17,fraydoon,rastinejad,na,na,na,na,na

MRF thus provides an alternative way to quantitatively detect and analyse complex changes that can represent physical alterations of a substance or early indicators of disease. MRF can also be used to identify the presence of a specific target material or tissue, which will increase the sensitivity, specificity and speed of a magnetic resonance study, and potentially lead to new diagnostic testing methodologies. When-paired with an appropriate pattern-recognition algorithm, MRF inherently suppresses measurement errors and can thus improve measurement accuracy.","[Ma, Dan; Gulani, Vikas; Seiberlich, Nicole; Duerk, Jeffrey L.; Griswold, Mark A.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Gulani, Vikas; Sunshine, Jeffrey L.; Duerk, Jeffrey L.; Griswold, Mark A.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Radiol, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Gulani, Vikas; Sunshine, Jeffrey L.; Duerk, Jeffrey L.; Griswold, Mark A.] Univ Hosp Cleveland, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Liu, Kecheng] Siemens Healthcare USA, Malvern, PA 19355 USA","Griswold, MA (reprint author), Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, 10900 Euclid Ave, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",mark.griswold@case.edu,,,NIH [R01HL094557]; Siemens Healthcare,"Support for this study was provided by NIH R01HL094557 and Siemens Healthcare.

However, the rate of linkage disequilibrium decay amongst differentially methylated regions targeted by RNA-directed DNA methylation is similar to the rate for single nucleotide polymorphisms. Association analyses of these RNA-directed DNA methylation regions with genetic variants identified thousands of methylation quantitative trait loci, which revealed the population estimate of genetically dependent methylation variation.

Grid cells had large and reproducible ramps of membrane potential depolarization that were the characteristic signature tightly correlated with firing fields. Grid cells also demonstrated intracellular theta oscillations that influenced their spike timing. However, the properties of theta amplitude modulations were not consistent with the view that they determine firing field locations.

A direct photon-photon interaction occurs in so-called Kerr media, which typically induce only weak nonlinearity at the cost of significant loss. So far, it has not been possible to reach the single-photon Kerr regime, in which the interaction strength between individual photons exceeds the loss rate. Here, using a three-dimensional circuit quantum electrodynamic architecture(4), we engineer an artificial Kerr medium that enters this regime and allows the observation, of new quantum effects. We realize a gedanken experiment(5) in which the collapse and revival of a coherent state can be observed. This time evolution is a consequence of the quantization of the light field in the cavity and the nonlinear interaction between individual photons. During the evolution, non-classical superpositions of coherent states (that is, multi-component 'Schrodinger cat' states) are formed. We visualize this evolution by measuring the Husimi Q function and confirm the non-classical properties of these transient states by cavity state tomography. The ability to create and manipulate superpositions of coherent states in such a high-quality-factor photon mode opens perspectives for combining the physics of continuous variables(6) with superconducting circuits. The single-photon Kerr effect could be used in quantum non-demolition measurement of photons(7), single-photon generation(8), autonomous quantum feedback schemes(9) and quantum logic operations(10).","[Kirchmair, Gerhard; Vlastakis, Brian; Nigg, Simon E.; Paik, Hanhee; Mirrahimi, Mazyar; Frupzio, Luigi; Girvin, S.

This result supports the idea that mechanical oscillators may perform useful functions in the processing of quantum information with superconducting circuits(4-7), either by serving as a quantum memory for the ephemeral state of a microwave field or by providing a quantum interface between otherwise incompatible systems(8-14). As yet, the transfer of an itinerant state or a propagating mode of a microwave field to and from a storage medium has not been demonstrated, owing to the inability to turn on and off the interaction between the microwave field and the medium sufficiently quickly. Here we demonstrate that the state of an itinerant microwave field can be coherently transferred into, stored in and retrieved from a mechanical oscillator with amplitudes at the single-quantum level. Crucially, the time to capture and to retrieve the microwave state is shorter than the quantum state lifetime of the mechanical oscillator. In this quantum regime, the mechanical oscillator can both store quantum information and enable its transfer between otherwise incompatible systems.","[Palomaki, T. A.; Harlow, J. W.; Lehnert, K.

Mesoporosity provides the desired highly accessible surfaces but many applications also demand long-range electronic connectivity and structural coherence(6). A mesoporous single-crystal (MSC) semiconductor can meet both criteria. Here we demonstrate a general synthetic method of growing semiconductor MSCs of anatase TiO2 based on seeded nucleation and growth inside a mesoporous template immersed in a dilute reaction solution. We show that both isolated MSCs and ensembles incorporated into films have substantially higher conductivities and electron mobilities than does nanocrystalline TiO2. Conventional nanocrystals, unlike MSCs, require in-film thermal sintering to reinforce electronic contact between particles, thus increasing fabrication cost, limiting the use of flexible substrates and precluding, for instance, multijunction solar cell processing. Using MSC films processed entirely below 150 degrees C, we have fabricated all-solid-state, low-temperature sensitized solar cells that have 7.3 per cent efficiency, the highest efficiency yet reported. These high-surface-area anatase single crystals will find application in many different technologies, and this generic synthetic strategy extends the possibility of mesoporous single-crystal growth to a range of functional ceramics and semiconductors.","[Crossland, Edward J.

However, how ATP is released to fulfil this function is not fully understood. Here we show that calcium homeostasis modulator 1 (CALHM1), a voltage-gated ion channel(2,3), is indispensable for taste-stimuli-evoked ATP release from sweet-, bitter- and umami-sensing taste bud cells. Calhm1 knockout mice have severely impaired perceptions of sweet, bitter and umami compounds, whereas their recognition of sour and salty tastes remains mostly normal. Calhm1 deficiency affects taste perception without interfering with taste cell development or integrity. CALHM1 is expressed specifically in sweet/bitter/umami-sensing type II taste bud cells. Its heterologous expression induces a novel ATP permeability that releases ATP from cells in response to manipulations that activate the CALHM1 ion channel. Knockout of Calhm1 strongly reduces voltage-gated currents in type II cells and taste-evoked ATP release from taste buds without affecting the excitability of taste cells by taste stimuli. Thus, CALHM1 is a voltage-gated ATP-release channel required for sweet, bitter and umami taste perception.","[Taruno, Akiyuki; Ma, Zhongming; Li, Ang; Civan, Mortimer M.; Foskett, J.

Endosteal osteoblasts(1,2) and perivascular stromal cells including endothelial cells(3), CXCL12-abundant reticular cells(4,5), leptin-receptor-positive stromal cells(6), and nestin-green fluorescent protein (GFP) -positive mesenchymal progenitors(7) have all been implicated in HSC maintenance. However, it is unclear whether specific haematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) subsets reside in distinct niches defined by the surrounding stromal cells and the regulatory molecules they produce. CXCL12 (chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12) regulates both HSCs and lymphoid progenitors and is expressed by all of these stromal cell populations(7-11). Here we selectively deleted Cxcl12 from candidate niche stromal cell populations and characterized the effect on HPCs. Deletion of Cxcl12 from mineralizing osteoblasts has no effect on HSCs or lymphoid progenitors. Deletion of Cxcl12 from osterix-expressing stromal cells, which include CXCL12-abundant reticular cells and osteoblasts, results in constitutive HPC mobilization and a loss of B-lymphoid progenitors, but HSC function is normal. Cxcl12 deletion from endothelial cells results in a modest loss of long-term repopulating activity. Strikingly, deletion of Cxcl12 from nestin-negative mesenchymal progenitors using Prx1-cre (Pod also known as Prrx1) is associated with a marked loss of HSCs, long-term repopulating activity, HSC quiescence and common lymphoid progenitors. These data suggest that osterix-expressing stromal cells comprise a distinct niche that supports B-lymphoid progenitors and retains HPCs in the bone marrow, and that expression of CXCL12 from stromal cells in the perivascular region, including endothelial cells and mesenchymal progenitors, supports HSCs.","[Greenbaum, Adam; Day, Ryan B.; Christopher, Matthew J.; Borgerding, Joshua N.; Link, Daniel C.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Hsu, Yen-Michael S.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Immunol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Schuettpelz, Laura G.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Nagasawa, Takashi] Kyoto Univ, Inst Frontier Med Sci, Dept Immunobiol & Hematol, Kyoto 6068507, Japan; [Nagasawa, Takashi] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, Core Res Evolutionary Sci & Technol, Tokyo 1020075, Japan","Link, DC (reprint author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.",dlink@dom.wustl.edu,"Greenbaum, Adam/S-4034-2016",,"NIH [RO1 HL60772, F30 HL097423]","We thank J.

Here we assess the physiological sources of the chemokine CXCL12 for HSC and restricted progenitor maintenance. Cxcl12(DsRed) knock-in mice (DsRed-Express2 recombined into the Cxcl12 locus) showed that Cxcl12 was primarily expressed by perivascular stromal cells and, at lower levels, by endothelial cells, osteoblasts and some haematopoietic cells. Conditional deletion of Cxcl12 from haematopoietic cells or nestin-cre-expressing cells had little or no effect on HSCs or restricted progenitors. Deletion of Cxcl12 from endothelial cells depleted HSCs but not myeloerythroid or lymphoid progenitors. Deletion of Cxcl12 from perivascular stromal cells depleted HSCs and certain restricted progenitors and mobilized these cells into circulation. Deletion of Cxcl12 from osteoblasts depleted certain early lymphoid progenitors but not HSCs or myeloerythroid progenitors, and did not mobilize these cells into circulation.

In mouse female PGCs, expression of stimulated by retinoic acid gene 8 (Stra8) and meiosis are induced in response to retinoic acid provided from the mesonephroi(2-5). Given the widespread role of retinoic add signalling during development(6,7), the molecular mechanisms that enable PGCs to express Stra8 and enter meiosis in a timely manner are unknown(2,8). Here we identify gene-dosage-dependent roles in PGC development for Ring1 and Rnf2, two central components of the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1)(9,10). Both paralogues are essential for PGC development between days 10.5 and 11.5 of gestation. Rnf2 is subsequently required in female PGCs to maintain high levels of Oct4 (also known as Pou5f1) and Nanog expression(11), and to prevent premature induction of meiotic gene expression and entry into meiotic prophase. Chemical inhibition of retinoic acid signalling partially suppresses precocious Oct4 downregulation and Stra8 activation in Rnf2-deficient female PGCs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses show that Stra8 is a direct target of PRC1 and PRC2 in PGCs. These data demonstrate the importance of PRC1 gene dosage in PGC development and in coordinating the timing of sex differentiation of female PGCs by antagonizing extrinsic retinoic add signalling.","[Yokobayashi, Shihori; Liang, Ching-Yeu; Kohler, Hubertus; Nestorov, Peter; Liu, Zichuan; Roloff, Tim C.; Peters, Antoine H.

Some epithelial cancers are known to occur in transitional zones between two types of epithelium, whereas others have been shown to originate in epithelial tissue stem cells'. The stem cell niche of the ovarian surface epithelium (OSE), which is ruptured and regenerates during ovulation, has not yet been defined unequivocally. Here we identify the hilum region of the mouse ovary, the transitional (or junction) area between the OSE, mesothelium and tubal (oviductal) epithelium, as a previously unrecognized stem cell niche of the OSE. We find that cells of the hilum OSE are cycling slowly and express stem and/or progenitor cell markers ALDH1, LGR5, LEF1, CD 133 and CK6B. These cells display long-term stem cell properties ex vivo and in vivo, as shown by our serial sphere generation and long-term lineage-tracing assays. Importantly, the hilum cells show increased transformation potential after inactivation of tumour suppressor genes Trp53 and Rb1, whose pathways are altered frequently in the most aggressive and common type of human EOC, high-grade serous adenocarcinomea(7,8). Our study supports experimentally the idea that susceptibility of transitional zones to malignant transformation may be explained by the presence of stem cell niches in those areas. Identification of a stem cell niche for the OSE may have important implications for understanding EOC pathogenesis.","[Flesken-Nikitin, Andrea; Hwang, Chang-Il; Cheng, Chieh-Yang; Nikitin, Alexander Yu] Cornell Univ, Dept Biomed Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Flesken-Nikitin, Andrea; Hwang, Chang-Il; Cheng, Chieh-Yang; Nikitin, Alexander Yu] Cornell Univ, Cornell Stem Cell Program, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Michurina, Tatyana V.; Enikolopov, Grigori] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; [Michurina, Tatyana V.; Enikolopov, Grigori] Moscow Inst Phys & Technol, NBIC, Moscow 123182, Russia","Nikitin, AY (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Dept Biomed Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",an58@cornell.edu,,"Hwang, Chang-il/0000-0002-5710-7672; Enikolopov, Grigori/0000-0001-8178-8917","NYSTEM; US National Institutes of Health (NIH); National Cancer Institute (NCI) [CA096823, CA112354]; NYSTEM [CO23050, N1 1G-160]; Marsha Rivkin Center for Ovarian Cancer Research; NIH National Institute of Mental Health [MH092928]; NIH National Institute on Aging [AG040209]; Russian Ministry of Education and Science;  [NIH NICHD T32HD052471]","We would like to thank T. lumbar for critical reading of this manuscript, J.

Here we describe the identification of a central regulator underlying a major-effect quantitative trait locus for plant maturity and initiation of tuber development. We show that this gene belongs to the family of DOF (DNA-binding with one finger) transcription factors' and regulates tuberization and plant life cycle length, by acting as a mediator between the circadian clock and the StSP6A mobile tuberization signal(2). We also show that natural allelic variants evade post-translational light regulation, allowing cultivation outside the geographical centre of origin of potato. Potato is a member of the Solanaceae family and is one of the world's most important food crops. This annual plant originates from the Andean regions of South America(3). Potato develops tubers from underground stems called stolons. Its equatorial origin makes potato essentially short-day dependent for tuberization and potato will not make tubers in the long-day conditions of spring and summer in the northern latitudes. When introduced in temperate zones, wild material will form tubers in the course of the autumnal shortening of day-length. Thus, one of the first selected traits in potato leading to a European potato type(4) is likely to have been long-day acclimation for tuberization. Potato breeders can exploit the naturally occurring variation in tuberization onset and life cycle length, allowing varietal breeding for different latitudes, harvest times and markets.","[Kloosterman, Bjorn; Carretero Gomez, Maria del Mar; Oortwijn, Marian; de Boer, Jan M.; Kowitwanich, Krissana; van Eck, Herman J.; Visser, Richard G.

However, SARS coronavirus caused severe lower respiratory disease with nearly 10% mortality and evidence of systemic spread(2). Recently, another coronavirus (human coronavirus-Erasmus Medical Center (hCoV-EMC)) was identified in patients with severe and sometimes lethal lower respiratory tract infection(3,4). Viral genome analysis revealed close relatedness to coronaviruses found in bats'. Here we identify dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4; also known as CD26) as a functional receptor for hCoV-EMC. DPP4 specifically co-purified with the receptor-binding Si domain of the hCoV-EMC spike protein from lysates of susceptible Huh-7 cells. Antibodies directed against DPP4 inhibited hCoV-EMC infection of primary human bronchial epithelial cells and Huh-7 cells. Expression of human and bat (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) DPP4 in non-susceptible COS-7 cells enabled infection by hCoV-EMC. The use of the evolutionarily conserved DPP4 protein from different species as a functional receptor provides clues about the host range potential of hCoV-EMC. In addition, it will contribute critically to our understanding of the pathogenesis and epidemiology of this emerging human coronavirus, and may facilitate the development of intervention strategies.","[Raj, V.

Centrosome duplication is controlled in part by CP110, a centriolar protein that positively regulates centriole duplication while restricting centriole elongation and ciliogenesis. Maintenance of normal CP110 levels is essential, as excessive CP110 drives centrosome over-duplication and suppresses ciliogenesis, whereas its depletion inhibits centriole amplification and leads to highly elongated centrioles and aberrant assembly of cilia in growing cells(1,2). CP110 levels are tightly controlled, partly through ubiquitination by the ubiquitin ligase complex SCFcyclin (F) during G2 and M phases of the cell cycle(3). Here, using human cells, we report a new mechanism for the regulation of centrosome duplication that requires USP33, a deubiquitinating enzyme that is able to regulate CP110 levels. USP33 interacts with CP110 and localizes to centrioles primarily in S and G2/M phases, the periods during which centrioles duplicate and elongate. USP33 potently and specifically deubiquitinates CP110, but not other cyclin-F substrates. USP33 activity antagonizes SCFcyclin F-mediated ubiquitination and promotes the generation of supernumerary centriolar foci, whereas ablation of USP33 destabilizes CP110 and thereby inhibits centrosome amplification and mitotic defects. To our knowledge, we have identified the first centriolar deubiquitinatimg enzyme whose expression regulates centrosome homeostasis by countering cyclin-F-mediated destruction of a key substrate. Our results point towards potential therapeutic strategies for inhibiting tumorigenesis associated with centrosome amplification.","[Li, Ji; D'Angiolella, Vincenzo; Kim, Sehyun; Kobayashi, Tetsuo; Fu, Wenxiang; Pagano, Michele; Dynlacht, Brian David] NYU, Sch Med, Smilow Res Ctr, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Li, Ji; D'Angiolella, Vincenzo; Kim, Sehyun; Kobayashi, Tetsuo; Fu, Wenxiang; Pagano, Michele; Dynlacht, Brian David] NYU, Sch Med, Smilow Res Ctr, Inst Canc, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Seeley, E.

The best studied is Ca2+-ATPase from muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (SERCA1a), a Ca2+ pump that relaxes muscle cells after contraction, and crystal structures have been determined for most of the reaction intermediates(1,2). An important outstanding structure is that of the El intermediate, which has empty high-affinity Ca2+-binding sites ready to accept new cytosolic Ca2+. In the absence of Ca2+ and at pH 7 or higher, the ATpase is predominantly in El, not in E2 (low affinity for ce(2+), and if millimolar Mg2+ is present, one Mg2+ is expected to occupy one of the Ca2+-binding sites with a millimolar dissociation constant(4,5). This Mg2+ accelerates the reaction cycle(4), not permitting phosphorylation without Ca2+ binding. Here we describe the crystal structure of native SERCA1a (from rabbit) in this El-Mg2+ state at 3.0 A resolution in addition to crystal structures of SERCA1a in E2 free from exogenous inhibitors, and address the structural basis of the activation signal for phosphoryl transfer. Unexpectedly, sarcolipin(6), a small regulatory membrane protein of Ca2+-ATPase, is bound, stabilizing the El Mg2+ state. Sarcolipin is a close homologue of phospholamban, which is a critical mediator of P-adrenergic signal in Ca2+ regulation in heart (for reviews, see, for example, refs 8-10), and seems to play an important role in muscle-based thermogenesis(11). We also determined the crystal structure of recombinant SERCA1a devoid of sarcolipin, and describe the structural basis of inhibition by sarcolipim/phospholamban. Thus, the crystal structures reported here fill a gap in the structural elucidation of the reaction cycle and provide a solid basis for understanding the physiological regulation of the calcium pump.","[Toyoshima, Chikashi; Iwasawa, Shiho; Ogawa, Haruo; Hirata, Ayami; Tsueda, Junko] Univ Tokyo, Inst Mol & Cellular Biosci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130032, Japan; [Inesi, Giuseppe] Calif Pacific Med Ctr, Res Inst, San Francisco, CA 94107 USA","Toyoshima, C (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Inst Mol & Cellular Biosci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130032, Japan.",ct@iam.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan [2009B0025]","We thank H.

Re-sequestration requires active transport and is catalysed by the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA), which has a key role in defining the contractile properties of skeletal and heart muscle tissue. The activity of SERCA is regulated by two small, homologous membrane proteins called phospholamban (PLB, also known as PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN)(1,2). Detailed structural information explaining this regulatory mechanism has been lacking, and the structural features defining the pathway through which cytoplasmic Ca2+ enters the intramembranous binding sites of SERCA have remained unknown. Here we report the crystal structure of rabbit SERCA1a (also known as ATP2A1) in complex with SLN at 3.1 angstrom resolution. The regulatory SLN traps the Ca2+-ATPase in a previously undescribed E1 state, with exposure of the Ca2+ sites through an open cytoplasmic pathway stabilized by Mg2+. The structure suggests a mechanism for selective Ca2+ loading and activation of SERCA, and provides new insight into how SLN and PLB inhibition arises from stabilization of this E1 intermediate state without bound Ca2+. These findings may prove useful in studying how autoinhibitory domains of other ion pumps modulate transport across biological membranes.","[Winther, Anne-Marie L.; Hansen, John B.; Buch-Pedersen, Morten J.] Pcovery, DK-1871 Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Winther, Anne-Marie L.; Bublitz, Maike; Karlsen, Jesper L.; Moller, Jesper V.; Nissen, Poul] Danish Natl Res Fdn, Ctr Membrane Pumps Cells & Dis PUMPkin, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Winther, Anne-Marie L.; Bublitz, Maike; Karlsen, Jesper L.; Nissen, Poul] Aarhus Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark; [Moller, Jesper V.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biomed, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark","Nissen, P (reprint author), Danish Natl Res Fdn, Ctr Membrane Pumps Cells & Dis PUMPkin, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",pn@mb.au.dk; mbp@pcovery.com,,"Nissen, Poul/0000-0003-0948-6628; Lund Winther, Anne-Marie/0000-0002-5776-0989",Danish Council for Independent Research (Technology and Production Sciences); Danish National Advanced Technology Foundation; ERC; Danish Research Council for Strategic Research,"We thank the staff at beamlines 911-3 at MaxLab and X06SA at the Swiss Light Source.

We fit a mathematical dynamical systems model including subsyringeal pressure, syringeal biomechanics and upper-vocal-tract filtering to the songs of zebra finches. This reduces the dimensionality of singing dynamics, described as trajectories (motor 'gestures') in a space of syringeal pressure and tension. Here we assess model performance by characterizing the auditory response 'replay' of song premotor HVC neurons to the presentation of song variants in sleeping birds, and by examining HVC activity in singing birds. HVC projection neurons were excited and interneurons were suppressed within a few milliseconds of the extreme time points of the gesture trajectories. Thus, the HVC precisely encodes vocal motor output through activity at the times of extreme points of movement trajectories. We propose that the sequential activity of HVC neurons is used as a 'forward' model, representing the sequence of gestures in song to make predictions on expected behaviour and evaluate feedback.","[Amador, Ana; Margoliash, Daniel] Univ Chicago, Dept Organismal Biol & Anat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Sanz Perl, Yonatan; Mindlin, Gabriel B.] Univ Buenos Aires, FCEN, Dept Phys, RA-1428 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Margoliash, D (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Dept Organismal Biol & Anat, 1027 East 57th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",dan@bigbird.uchicago.edu,,,Human Frontiers Science Program cross-disciplinary fellowship; ANCyT; CONICET; UBA; NIDCD; NSF/CRCNS;  [NIDCD006876],"We are grateful to R.

These stem cells have been variously described as rapidly cycling or. quiescent. A functional arrangement of stem cells that reconciles both of these behaviours has so far been difficult to obtain. Alternative explanations for quiescent cells have been that they act as a parallel or reserve population that replace rapidly cycling stem cells periodically or after injury; their exact nature remains unknown. Here we show mouse intestinal quiescent cells to be precursors that are committed to mature into differentiated secretory cells of the Paneth and enteroendocrine lineage. However, crucially we find that after intestinal injury they are capable of extensive proliferation and can give rise to clones comprising the main epithelial cell types. Thus, quiescent cells can be recalled to the-stem-cell state. These findings establish quiescent cells as an effective clonogenic reserve and provide a motivation for investigating their role in pathologies such as colorectal cancers and intestinal inflammation.","[Winton, Douglas J.] Canc Res UK Cambridge Res Inst, Li Ka Shing Ctr, Cambridge CB2 0RE, England; [Buczacki, Simon J.

Here we crystallized an approximately 440-kilodalton complex of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Exo-10 bound to a carboxy-terminal region of Rrp6 and to an RNA duplex with a 3'-overhang of 31 ribonucleotides. The 2.8 angstrom resolution structure shows how RNA is funnelled into the Exo-9 channel in a single-stranded conformation by an unwinding pore. Rrp44 adopts a closed conformation and captures the RNA 3'-end that exits from the side of Exo-9. Exo-9 subunits bind RNA with-sequence-unspecific interactions reminiscent of archaeal exosomes.

At present, its uncertainty is dominated by the uncertainty in the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), which, being our second-closest galaxy, serves as the best anchor point for the cosmic distance scale(2,3). Observations of eclipsing binaries offer a unique opportunity to measure stellar parameters and distances precisely and accurately(4,5). The eclipsing-binary method was previously applied to the LMC6,7, but the accuracy of the distance results was lessened by the need to model the bright, early-type systems used in those studies. Here we report determinations of the distances to eight long-period, late-type eclipsing systems in the LMC, composed of cool, giant stars. For these systems, we can accurately measure both the linear and the angular sizes of their components and avoid the most important problems related to the hot, early-type systems. The LMC distance that we derive from these systems (49.97 +/- 0.19 (statistical) +/- 1:11 (systematic) kiloparsecs) is accurate to 2.2 per cent and provides a firm base for a 3-per-cent determination of the Hubble constant, with prospects for improvement to 2 per cent in the future.","[Pietrzynski, G.; Graczyk, D.; Gieren, W.; Pilecki, B.; Villanova, S.; Gallenne, A.] Univ Concepcion, Dept Astron, Concepcion, Chile; [Pietrzynski, G.; Pilecki, B.; Udalski, A.; Soszynski, I.; Kozlowski, S.; Konorski, P.; Suchomska, K.; Kubiak, M.; Szymanski, M.

The challenge of developing effective separation and purification technologies that have much smaller energy footprints is greater for carbon dioxide (CO2) than for other gases; in addition to its involvement in climate change, CO2, is an impurity in natural gas, biogas (natural gas produced from biomass), syngas (CO/H-2, the main source of hydrogen in refineries) and many other gas streams. In the context of porous crystalline materials that can exploit both equilibrium and kinetic selectivity, size selectivity and targeted molecular recognition are attractive characteristics for CO2 separation and capture, as exemplified by zeolites 5A and 13X (ref. 2), as well as metal-organic materials (MOMs)(3-9). Here we report that a crystal engineering(7) or reticular chemistry(5,9) strategy that controls pore functionality and size in a series of MOMs with coordinately saturated metal centres and periodically arrayed hexafluorosilicate (SiF62-) anions enables a 'sweet spot' of kinetics and thermodynamics that offers high volumetric uptake at low CO2 partial pressure (less than 0.15 bar). Most importantly, such MOMs offer an unprecedented CO2 sorption selectivity over N-2, H-2 and CH4, even in the presence of moisture. These MOMs are therefore relevant to CO2 separation in the context of post-combustion (flue gas, CO2/N-2), pre-combustion (shifted synthesis gas stream, CO2/H-2) and natural gas upgrading (natural gas clean-up, CO2/CH4).","[Nugent, Patrick; Burd, Stephen D.; Forrest, Katherine; Pham, Tony; Ma, Shengqian; Space, Brian; Wojtas, Lukasz; Eddaoudi, Mohamed; Zaworotko, Michael J.] Univ S Florida, Dept Chem, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; [Belmabkhout, Youssef; Cairns, Amy J.; Luebke, Ryan; Eddaoudi, Mohamed] 4700 King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol KAUST, Div Phys Sci & Engn, Adv Membranes & Porous Mat Ctr, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia","Eddaoudi, M (reprint author), Univ S Florida, Dept Chem, 4202 East Fowler Ave, Tampa, FL 33620 USA.",mohamed.eddaoudi@kaust.edu.sa; xtal@usf.edu,"zaworotko, michael/A-7448-2009; Eddaoudi, Mohamed/D-2298-2009; Luebke, Ryan/F-4333-2011; Pham, Tony/A-3787-2014; Ma, Shengqian/B-4022-2012; Nugent, Patrick/I-8308-2015","zaworotko, michael/0000-0002-1360-540X; Eddaoudi, Mohamed/0000-0003-1916-9837; Luebke, Ryan/0000-0002-1285-3321; Ma, Shengqian/0000-0002-1897-7069; Nugent, Patrick/0000-0002-1585-2762","KAUST [FIC/2010/06]; XSEDE [TG-DMR090028]; National Science Foundation/Department of Energy [NSF/CHE-0822838]; US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-AC02-06CH11357]","This publication is based on work supported by KAUST award number FIC/2010/06 (ME. and M.J.Z.) and KAUST start up funds (RE.).

With the help of low-temperature proton-exchange membrane fuel cells, Molecular hydrogen can be converted efficiently to produce electricity(1-5). The implementation of sustainable hydrogen production and subsequent hydrogen conversion to energy is called ""hydrogen economy""(2). Unfortunately, its physical properties make the transport and handling of hydrogen gas difficult. To overcome this, methanol can be used as a material for the storage of hydrogen, because it is a liquid at room temperature and contains 12.6 per cent hydrogen. However, the state-of-the-art method for the production of hydrogen from methanol (methanol reforming) is conducted at high temperatures (over 200 degrees Celsius) and high pressures (25-50 bar), which limits its potential applications(6-8). Here we describe an efficient low-temperature aqueous-phase methanol dehydrogenation process, which is facilitated by ruthenium complexes. Hydrogen generation by this method proceeds at 65-95 degrees Celsius and ambient pressure with excellent catalyst turnover frequencies (4,700 per hour) and turnover numbers (exceeding 350,000). This would make the delivery of hydrogen on mobile devices-and hence the use of methanol as a practical hydrogen carrier-feasible.","[Nielsen, Martin; Alberico, Elisabetta; Baumann, Wolfgang; Drexler, Hans-Joachim; Junge, Henrik; Beller, Matthias] Univ Rostock, Leibniz Inst Katalyse Eingetragener Verein, D-18059 Rostock, Germany; [Alberico, Elisabetta] CNR, Ist Chim Biomol, I-07040 Sassari, Italy; [Gladiali, Serafino] Univ Sassari, Dipartimento Chim & Farm, I-07100 Sassari, Italy","Beller, M (reprint author), Univ Rostock, Leibniz Inst Katalyse Eingetragener Verein, Albert Einstein Str 29A, D-18059 Rostock, Germany.",matthias.beller@catalysis.de,"Nielsen, Martin/H-7522-2013","Nielsen, Martin/0000-0002-3170-1198",Alexander von Humboldt Foundation; BMBF; Ministry of Science and Education of Mecklenburg-Western Pommerania,M.N. thanks the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation for financial support.

In a possible Snowball Earth climate, ocean circulation and mixing processes would have set the melting and freezing rates that determine ice thickness(5,6), would have influenced the survival of photosynthetic life(4,5,7-9), and may provide important constraints for the interpretation of geochemical and sedimentological observations(4,10). Here we show that in a Snowball Earth, the ocean would have been well mixed and. characterized by a dynamic circulation(11), with vigorous equatorial meridional overturning circulation, zonal equatorial jets, a well developed eddy field, strong coastal upwelling and convective mixing. This is in contrast to the sluggish ocean often expected in a Snowball Earth scenario(3) owing to the insulation of the ocean from atmospheric forcing by the thick ice cover. As a result of vigorous convective mixing, the ocean temperature, salinity and density were either uniform in the vertical direction or weakly stratified in a few locations. Our results are based on a model that couples ice flow and ocean circulation, and is driven by a weak geothermal heat flux under a global ice cover about a kilometre thick. Compared with the modern ocean, the Snowball Earth ocean had far larger vertical mixing rates, and comparable horizontal mixing by ocean eddies. The strong circulation and coastal upwellimg resulted in melting rates near continents as much as ten times larger than previously estimated(6,7). Although we cannot resolve the debate over the existence of global ice cover(10,12,13), we discuss the implications for the nutrient supply of photosynthetic activity and for banded iron formations.

They have been widely considered to be ectoparasites of pterosaurs or feathered dinosaurs, based on the putative presence of piercing and sucking mouthparts and hind tibio-basitarsal pincers purportedly used to fix onto the host's hairs or feathers(1-6). Both the supposed host and parasite occur in the Daohugou beds from the Middle Jurassic epoch of China (approximately 165 million years ago)(7,8). Here we analyse the morphology of strashilids from the Daohugou beds, and reach markedly different conclusions; namely that strashilids are highly specialized flies (Diptera) bearing large membranous wings, with substantial sexual dimorphism of the hind legs and abdominal extensions. The idea that they belong to an extinct order(2) is unsupported, and the lineage can be placed within the true flies. In terms of major morphological and inferred behavioural features, strashilids resemble the recent (extant) and relict members of the aquatic fly family Nymphomyiidae. Their ontogeny are distinguished by the persistence in adult males of larval abdominal respiratory gills, representing a unique case of paedomorphism among endopterygote insects. Adult strashilids were probably aquatic or amphibious, shedding their wings after emergence and mating in the water.","[Huang, Diying; Cai, Chenyang; Li, Qibin] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Nel, Andre] Museum Natl Hist Nat, CNRS UMR 7205, CP 50, F-75005 Paris, France; [Engel, Michael S.] Univ Kansas, Nat Hist Museum, Div Entomol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Engel, Michael S.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA","Huang, DY (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",dyhuang@nigpas.ac.cn,"Engel, Michael/C-5461-2012","Engel, Michael/0000-0003-3067-077X","National Basic Research Program of China [2012CB821903]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [91114201, J1210006]; Outstanding Youth Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK2012049]; Chinese Academy of Sciences [KZCX2-YW-QN104]; US National Science Foundation [DEB-0542909]","We are grateful to C.

In mammals, the stem cell niche within hair follicles is home to epithelial hair follicle stem cells and melanocyte stem cells, which sustain cyclical bouts of hair regeneration and pigmentation(1-4). To generate pigmented hairs, synchrony is achieved such that upon initiation of a new hair cycle, stem cells of each type activate lineage commitment(2,5). Dissecting the inter-stem-cell crosstalk governing this intricate coordination has been difficult, because mutations affecting one lineage often affect the other. Here we identify transcription factor NFIB as. an unanticipated coordinator of stem cell behaviour. Hair follicle stem-cell-specific conditional targeting of Nfib in mice uncouples stem cell synchrony. Remarkably, this happens not by perturbing hair cycle and follicle architecture, but rather by promoting melanocyte stem cell proliferation and differentiation. The early production of melanin is restricted to melanocyte stem cells at the niche base. Melanocyte stem cells more distant from the dermal papilla are unscathed, thereby preventing hair greying typical of melanocyte stem cell differentiation mutants. Furthermore, we pinpoint KIT-ligand as a dermal papilla signal promoting melanocyte stem cell differentiation. Additionally, through chromatin-immunoprecipitation with high-throughput-sequencing and transcriptional profiling, we identify endothelin 2 (Edn2) as an NFIB target aberrantly activated in NFIB-deficient hair follicle stem cells. Ectopically induced Edn2 recapitulates NFIB-deficient phenotypes in wildtype mice. Conversely, endothelin receptor antagonists and/or KIT blocking antibodies prevent precocious melanocyte stem cell differentiation in the NFIB-deficient niche. Our findings reveal how melanocyte and hair follicle stem cell behaviours maintain reliance upon cooperative factors within the niche, and how this can be uncoupled in injury, stress and disease states.","[Chang, Chiung-Ying; Pasolli, H.

Here we report a new post-transcriptional switch that dictates the spatiotemporal and mutually exclusive expression of two alternative gene products from a single transcript. Expression of primate-specific exonic microRNA-198 (miR-198)(2), located in the 3'-untranslated region of follistatin-like 1 (FSTL1)(3) messenger RNA, switches to expression of the linked open reading frame of FSTL1 upon wounding in a human ex vivo organ culture system. We show that binding of a KH-type splicing regulatory protein (KSRP, also known as KHSRP) to the primary transcript determines the fate of the transcript and is essential for the processing of miR-198: transforming growth factor-beta signalling switches off miR-198 expression by downregulating KSRP, and promotes FSTL1 protein expression. We also show that FSTL1 expression promotes keratinocyte migration, whereas miR-198 expression has the opposite effect by targeting and inhibiting DIAPH1, PLAU and LAMC2. A clear inverse correlation between the expression pattern of FSTL1 (pro-migratory) and miR-198 (anti-migratory) highlights the importance of this regulatory switch in controlling context-specific gene expression to orchestrate wound re-epithelialization. The deleterious effect of failure of this switch is apparent in non-healing chronic diabetic ulcers, in which expression of miR-198 persists, FSTL1 is absent, and keratinocyte migration, re-epithelialization and wound healing all fail to occur.","[Sundaram, Gopinath M.; Common, John E.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as crucial regulators of cardiovascular function and some miRNAs have key roles in ageing(3,4). We propose that altered expression of miRNAs in the heart during ageing contributes to the age-dependent decline in cardiac function. Here we show that miR-34a is induced in the ageing heart and that in vivo silencing or genetic deletion of miR-34a reduces age-associated cardiomyocyte cell death. Moreover, miR-34a inhibition reduces cell death and fibrosis following acute myocardial infarction and improves recovery of myocardial function. Mechanistically, we identified PNUTS (also known as PPP1R10) as a novel direct miR-34a target, which reduces telomere shortening, DNA damage responses and cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and improves functional recovery after acute myocardial infarction. Together, these results identify age-induced expression of miR-34a and inhibition of its target PNUTS as a key mechanism that regulates cardiac contractile function during ageing and after acute myocardial infarction, by inducing DNA damage responses and telomere attrition.","[Boon, Reinier A.; Iekushi, Kazuma; Seeger, Timon; Fischer, Ariane; Heydt, Susanne; Kaluza, David; Treguer, Karine; Carmona, Guillaume; Bonauer, Angelika; Potente, Michael; Dimmeler, Stefanie] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Ctr Mol Med, Inst Cardiovasc Regenerat, D-60590 Frankfurt, Germany; [Lechner, Stefanie; Hermeking, Heiko] Univ Munich, Inst Pathol, D-80337 Munich, Germany; [Seeger, Timon; Girmatsion, Zenawit; Biliczki, Peter; Ehrlich, Joachim R.; Potente, Michael; Zeiher, Andreas M.] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Cardiol, D-60590 Frankfurt, Germany; [Horrevoets, Anton J.

Codon usage is also implicated in the control of transcription, splicing and RNA structure(4-6). Many genes exhibit little codon-usage bias, which is thought to reflect a lack of selection for messenger RNA translation. Alternatively, however, non-optimal codon usage may be of biological importance. The rhythmic expression and the proper function of the Neurospora FREQUENCY (FRQ) protein are essential for circadian clock function. Here we show that, unlike most genes in Neurospora, frq exhibits non-optimal codon usage across its entire open reading frame. Optimization of frq codon usage abolishes both overt and molecular circadian rhythms. Codon optimization not only increases FRQ levels but, unexpectedly, also results in conformational changes in FRQ protein, altered FRQ phosphorylation profile and stability, and impaired functions in the circadian feedback loops. These results indicate that non-optimal codon usage of frq is essential for its circadian clock function.

In the model cyanobacterial circadian clock system, the core oscillator proteins are encoded by the gene cluster kaiABC(1). Genes with high expression and functional importance, such as the kai genes, are usually encoded by optimal codons, yet the codon-usage bias of the kaiBC genes is not optimized for translational efficiency. We discovered a relationship between codon usage and a general property of circadian rhythms called conditionality; namely, that endogenous rhythmicity is robustly expressed under some environmental conditions but not others(2). Despite the generality of circadian conditionality, however, its molecular basis is unknown for any system. Here we show that in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongate, non-optimal codon usage was selected as a post-transcriptional. mechanism to switch between circadian and non-circadian regulation of gene expression as an adaptive response to environmental conditions. When the kaiBC sequence was experimentally optimized to enhance expression of the KaiB and KaiC proteins, intrinsic rhythmicity was enhanced at cool temperatures that are experienced by this organism in. its natural habitat. However, fitness at those temperatures was highest in cells hi which the endogenous rhythms were suppressed at cool temperatures as compared with cells exhibiting high-amplitude rhythmicity. These results indicate natural selection against circadian systems in cyanobacteria that are intrinsically robust at cool temperatures. Modulation of circadian amplitude is therefore crucial to its adaptive significance(3). Moreover, these results show the direct effects of codon usage on a complex phenotype and organismal fitness. Our work also challenges the long-standing view of directional selection towards optimal codons(4-7), and provides a key example of natural selection against optimal codons to achieve adaptive responses to environmental changes.","[Xu, Yao; Ma, Peijun; Rokas, Antonis; Johnson, Carl Hirschie] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Shah, Premal] Univ Penn, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Liu, Yi] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Physiol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA","Johnson, CH (reprint author), Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.",carl.h.johnson@vanderbilt.edu,"Johnson, Carl/I-4655-2014; Rokas, Antonis/A-9775-2008","Rokas, Antonis/0000-0002-7248-6551","National Institute of General Medical Science [R01 GM067152, R01 GM088595, GM068496, GM062591]; Welch Foundation [I-1560]; National Science Foundation [DEB-0844968]; Searle Scholars Program; Burroughs Wellcome Fund Career Award; David & Lucille Packard Foundation","We are grateful for the suggestions of M.

CPEB1 shuttles to the nudeus(5,6), where it co-localizes with splicing factors and mediates shortening of hundreds of mRNA 3' UTRs, thereby modulating their translation efficiency in the cytoplasm. CPEB1-mediated 3'-UTR shortening correlates with cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. CPEB1 binding to pre-mRNAs not only directs the use of alternative polyadenylation sites, but also changes alternative splicing by preventing U2AF65 recruitment. Our results reveal a novel function of CPEB1 in mediating alternative 3'-UTR processing, which is coordinated with regulation of mRNA translation, through its dual nuclear and cytoplasmic functions.","[Bava, Felice-Alessio; Mendez, Raul] Inst Res Biomed IRB Barcelona, Barcelona 08028, Spain; [Eliscovich, Carolina; Ferreira, Pedro G.; Minana, Belen; Ben-Dov, Claudia; Guigo, Roderic; Valcarcel, Juan] UPF, Ctr Genom Regulat CRG, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Valcarcel, Juan; Mendez, Raul] Passeig Lluis Co 23, ICREA, Barcelona 08010, Spain","Mendez, R (reprint author), Inst Res Biomed IRB Barcelona, Baldiri Reixac 10, Barcelona 08028, Spain.",raul.mendez@irbbarcelona.org,"Valcarcel, Juan/O-9814-2014; Guigo, Roderic/D-1303-2010; minana, belen/K-5530-2015; Ferreira, Pedro/J-6379-2013","Valcarcel, Juan/0000-0001-5398-3571; Guigo, Roderic/0000-0002-5738-4477; minana, belen/0000-0001-7676-5788; Ferreira, Pedro/0000-0003-3838-8664; Mendez, Raul/0000-0002-1952-6905","Consolider; MICINN; Generalitat de Catalunya; RNAREG; AICR; EURASNET; Fundacion Marcelino Botin; National Institutes of Health; Instituto de Salud Carlos III; ""la Caixa"" predoctoral fellowship; FCT-Portugal; Spanish MICINN; ICREA","We thank A.

It is also implicated in many common human neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we report the first crystal structure of the entire, intact complex I (from Thermus thermophilus) at 3.3 angstrom resolution. The structure of the 536-kDa complex comprises 16 different subunits, with a total of 64 transmembrane helices and 9 iron-sulphur clusters. The core fold of subunit Nqo8 (ND1 in humans) is, unexpectedly, similar to a half-channel of the antiporter-like subunits. Small subunits nearby form a linked second half-channel, which completes the fourth proton-translocation pathway (present in addition to the channels in three antiporter-like subunits). The quinone-binding site is unusually long, narrow and enclosed. The quinone headgroup binds at the deep end of this chamber, near iron-sulphur cluster N2. Notably, the chamber is linked to the fourth channel by a 'funnel' of charged residues. The link continues over the entire membrane domain as a flexible central axis of charged and polar residues, and probably has a leading role in the propagation of conformational changes, aided by coupling elements. The structure suggests that a unique, out-of-the-membrane quinone-reaction chamber enables the redox energy to drive concerted long-range conformational changes in the four antiporter-like domains, resulting in translocation of four protons per cycle.","[Baradaran, Rozbeh; Berrisford, John M.; Minhas, Gurdeep S.; Sazanov, Leonid A.] Wellcome Trust Res Labs, MRC, Mitochondrial Biol Unit, Cambridge CB2 0XY, England","Sazanov, LA (reprint author), Wellcome Trust Res Labs, MRC, Mitochondrial Biol Unit, MRC Bldg,Hills Rd, Cambridge CB2 0XY, England.",sazanov@mrc-mbu.cam.ac.uk,,"Berrisford, John/0000-0003-4442-5871",Medical Research Council,"This work was funded by the Medical Research Council.

In this model, line broadening and distortion result from rapid rotation and relativistic effects near the black hole, the line shape being sensitive to its spin. Alternative models in which the distortions result from absorption by intervening structures provide an equally good description of the data(8,9), and there has been no general agreement on which is correct. Recent claims(10) that the black hole(11,12) (2 X 10(6) solar masses) at the centre of the galaxy NGC 1365 is rotating at close to its maximum possible speed rest on the assumption of relativistic reflection. Here we report X-ray observations of NGC 1365 that reveal the relativistic disk features through broadened Fe-line emission and an associated Compton scattering excess of 10-30 kiloelectronvolts. Using temporal and spectral analyses, we disentangle continuum changes due to time-variable absorption from reflection, which we find arises from a region within 2.5 gravitational radii of the rapidly spinning black hole. Absorption-dominated models that do not include relativistic disk reflection can be ruled out both statistically and on physical grounds.","[Risaliti, G.] INAF Osservatoria Astrofis Arcetri, I-50125 Florence, Italy; [Risaliti, G.] Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Harrison, F.

Nevertheless, advancing our fundamental understanding of fluid transport on the smallest scales requires mass and ion dynamics to be ultimately characterized across an individual channel to avoid averaging over many pores. A major challenge for nanofluidics thus lies in building distinct and well-controlled nanochannels, amenable to the systematic exploration of their properties. Here we describe the fabrication and use of a hierarchical nanofluidic device made of a boron nitride nanotube that pierces an ultrathin membrane and connects two fluid reservoirs. Such a transmembrane geometry allows the detailed study of fluidic transport through a single nanotube under diverse forces, including electric fields, pressure drops and chemical gradients. Using this device, we discover very large, osmotically induced electric currents generated by salinity gradients, exceeding by two orders of magnitude their pressure-driven counterpart. We show that this result originates in the anomalously high surface charge carried by the nanotube's internal surface in water at large pH, which we independently quantify in conductance measurements. The nano-assembly route using nanostructures as building blocks opens the way to studying fluid, ionic and molecule transport on the nanoscale, and may lead to biomimetic functionalities. Our results furthermore suggest that boron nitride nanotubes could be used as membranes for osmotic power harvesting under salinity gradients.","[Siria, Alessandro; Poncharal, Philippe; Biance, Anne -Laure; Fulcrand, Remy; Purcell, Stephen T.; Bocquet, Lyderic] Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, Inst Lumiere Mat, UMR5306, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France; [Blase, Xavier] CNRS, Inst Neel, UPR 2940, F-38042 Grenoble, France; [Blase, Xavier] Univ Grenoble 1, F-38042 Grenoble, France","Bocquet, L (reprint author), Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, Inst Lumiere Mat, UMR5306, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France.",lyderic.bocquet@univ-lyon1.fr,"bocquet, lyderic/A-2241-2012; siria, alessandro/C-7030-2014; Fulcrand, Remy/D-5372-2015; Biance, Anne-Laure/J-8884-2017","bocquet, lyderic/0000-0003-3577-5335; ",ERC-AG project Micromegas; French ANR under the programme P3N,"L.B. acknowledges support from ERC-AG project Micromegas and the French ANR under the programme P3N.

These emissions result in the deposition of atmospheric nitrogen (N) in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, with implications for human and ecosystem health, greenhouse gas balances and biological diversity(1,3-5). However, information on the magnitude and environmental impact of N deposition in China is limited. Here we use nationwide data sets on bulk N deposition, plant foliar N and crop N uptake (from long-term unfertilized soils) to evaluate N deposition dynamics and their effect on ecosystems across China between 1980 and 2010. We find that the average annual bulk deposition of N increased by approximately 8 kilograms of nitrogen per hectare (P < 0.001) between the 1980s (13.2 kilograms of nitrogen per hectare) and the 2000s (21.1 kilograms of nitrogen Per hectare). Nitrogen deposition rates in the industrialized and agriculturally intensified regions of China are as high as the peak levels of deposition in northwestern Europe in the 1980s(6), before the introduction of mitigation measures(7,8). Nitrogen from ammonium (NH4+) is the dominant form of N in bulk deposition, but the rate of increase is largest for deposition of N from nitrate (NO3-), in agreement with decreased ratios of NH3 to NOx emissions since 1980. We also find that the impact of N deposition on Chinese ecosystems includes significantly increased plant foliar N concentrations in natural and semi-natural (that is, non-agricultural) ecosystems and increased crop N uptake from long-term-unfertilized crop-lands. China and other economies are facing a continuing challenge to reduce emissions of reactive nitrogen, N deposition and their negative effects on human health and the environment.","[Liu, Xuejun; Zhang, Ying; Han, Wenxuan; Tang, Aohan; Shen, Jianlin; Cui, Zhenling; Christie, Peter; Zhang, Fusuo] China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Vitousek, Peter] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Erisman, Jan Willem] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Erisman, Jan Willem] Louis Bolk Inst, NL-3972 LA Driebergen, Netherlands; [Goulding, Keith] Rothamsted Res, Sustainable Soils & Grassland Syst Dept, Harpenden AL5 2JQ, Herts, England; [Christie, Peter] Agri Food & Biosci Inst, Agri Environm Branch, Belfast BT9 5PX, Antrim, North Ireland; [Fangmeier, Andreas] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Landscape & Plant Ecol, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany","Zhang, FS (reprint author), China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",zhangfs@cau.edu.cn,"Shen, Jianlin/G-1820-2014; Goulding, Keith/B-2635-2012; Han, Wenxuan/B-8791-2016; Christie, Peter/B-7919-2008","Shen, Jianlin/0000-0002-5853-094X; Goulding, Keith/0000-0002-6465-1465; Han, Wenxuan/0000-0001-8678-7147; Christie, Peter/0000-0002-1939-7277; Fangmeier, Andreas/0000-0003-3794-9466","Chinese National Basic Research Program [2009CB118606]; NSFC [31121062, 41071151, 40973054];  [GK 1070]","We thank X.

If a population experiencing increasingly stressful conditions lacks appropriate phenotypic plasticity or access to more suitable habitats, then genetic change may be the only way to avoid extinction(1). Evolutionary rescue from extinction occurs when natural selection enriches a population for more stress-tolerant genetic variants(1,3). Some experimental studies have shown that lower rates of environmental change lead to more adapted populations or fewer extinctions(4-9). However, there has been little focus on the genetic changes that underlie evolutionary rescue. Here we demonstrate that some evolutionary trajectories are contingent on a lower rate of environmental change. We allowed hundreds of populations of Escherichia coli to evolve under variable rates of increase in concentration of the antibiotic rifampicin. We then genetically engineered all combinations of mutations from isolates evolved under lower rates of environmental change. By assessing fitness of these engineered strains across a range of drug concentrations, we show that certain genotypes are evolutionarily inaccessible under rapid environmental change. Rapidly deteriorating environments not only limit mutational opportunities by lowering population size, but they can also eliminate sets of mutations as evolutionary options. As anthropogenic activities are leading to environmental change at unprecedented rapidity(1), it is critical to understand how the rate of environmental change affects both demographic and genetic underpinnings of evolutionary rescue.","[Lindsey, Haley A.; Gallie, Jenna; Taylor, Susan; Kerr, Benjamin] Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Lindsey, Haley A.; Gallie, Jenna; Taylor, Susan; Kerr, Benjamin] Univ Washington, BEACON Ctr Study Evolut Act, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Gallie, Jenna] Eawag, Dept Environm Microbiol, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Gallie, Jenna] ETH, Dept Environm Syst Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland","Kerr, B (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",kerrb@uw.edu,,,National Science Foundation [DBI-0939454]; NSF CAREER [DEB0952825]; UW Royalty Research Fund [A74107],"We thank T.

The early Cambrian-period fuxianhuiids are regarded as basal representatives of stem-group Euarthropode(3-7), and their anterior morphology therefore offers key insights for reconstructing the ancestral condition of the euarthropod head(1-3,8-11) However, the paired post-antennal structures in Fuxianhuia protensa remain controversial(3,8,10); they have been interpreted as both 'great appendages'(1,2) and as gut diverticulae(4,12,13). Here we describe Chengjiangocaris kunmingensis sp. nov. and Fuxianhuia xiaoshibaensis sp. nov. from a new early Cambrian (Stage 3) fossil Lagerstatte in Yunnan, China. Numerous specimens of both species show a unique 'taphonomic dissection' of the anterodorsal head shield, revealing the cephalic organization in detail. We demonstrate the presence of a pair of specialized post-antennal appendages (SPAs) in the fuxianhuiid head, which attach at either side of the posteriorly directed mouth, behind the hypostome. Preserved functional articulations indicate a well-defined but restricted range of limb movement, suggestive of a simple type of sweep feeding. The organization of the SPAs in fuxianhuiids is incompatible with the (deutocerebral) anterior raptorial appendages of megacheirans(2,9,14,15), and argue against the presence of protocerebral limbs in the fuxianhuiids(1,2,9). The positions of the fuxianhuiid antennae and SPAs indicate that they are segmentally homologous to the deutocerebral and tritocerebral appendages of crown-group Euarthropoda respectively(2,11,16,17). These findings indicate that antenniform deutocerebral appendages with many podomeres are a plesiomorphic feature of the ancestral euarthropod head.","[Yang, Jie; Zhang, Xi-guang] Yunnan Univ, Key Lab Palaeobiol, Kunming 650091, Peoples R China; [Ortega-Hernandez, Javier; Butterfield, Nicholas J.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Earth Sci, Cambridge CB2 3EQ, England","Zhang, XG (reprint author), Yunnan Univ, Key Lab Palaeobiol, Kunming 650091, Peoples R China.",xgzhang@ynu.edu.cn,,"Butterfield, Nicholas/0000-0002-3046-7520","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41272027]; Ministry of Education of China [20115301110005]; CONACYT (Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia, Mexico); University of Cambridge Trusts; Darwin College, University of Cambridge","This study is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41272027), and the PhD Fund of the Ministry of Education of China (20115301110005).

Among these qualities, bitter and sour stimuli are innately aversive, whereas sweet and umami are appetitive and generally attractive to animals. By contrast, salty taste is unique in that increasing salt concentration fundamentally transforms an innately appetitive stimulus into a powerfully aversive one(3-7). This appetitive-aversive balance helps to maintain appropriate salt consumption(3,4,6,8), and represents an important part of fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. We have shown previously that the appetitive responses to NaCl are mediated by taste receptor cells expressing the epithelial sodium channel, ENaCs8, but the cellular substrate for salt aversion was unknown. Here we examine the cellular and molecular basis for the rejection of high concentrations of salts. We show that high salt recruits the two primary aversive taste pathways by activating the sour- and bitter-taste-sensing cells. We also demonstrate that genetic silencing of these pathways abolishes behavioural aversion to concentrated salt, without impairing salt attraction. Notably, mice devoid of salt-aversion pathways show unimpeded, continuous attraction even to very high concentrations of NaCl. We propose that the 'co-opting' of sour and bitter neural pathways evolved as a means to ensure that high levels of salt reliably trigger robust behavioural rejection, thus preventing its potentially detrimental effects on health.","[Oka, Yuki; Butnaru, Matthew; Zuker, Charles S.] Columbia Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Oka, Yuki; Butnaru, Matthew; Zuker, Charles S.] Columbia Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Oka, Yuki; Butnaru, Matthew; Zuker, Charles S.] Columbia Univ, Dept Neurosci, Columbia Coll Phys & Surg, New York, NY 10032 USA; [von Buchholtz, Lars; Ryba, Nicholas J.

The aetiological agents of this disease are trematode flatworms (Schistosoma) that live and lay eggs within the vasculature of the host. These eggs lodge in host tissues, causing inflammatory responses that are the primary cause of morbidity. Because these parasites can live and reproduce within human hosts for decades', elucidating the mechanisms that promote their longevity is of fundamental importance. Although adult pluripotent stem cells, called neoblasts, drive long-term homeostatic tissue maintenance in long-lived free-living flatworms(3,4) (for example, planarians), and neoblast-like cells have been described in some parasitic tapeworms', little is known about whether similar cell types exist in any trematode species. Here we describe a population of neoblast-like cells in the trematode Schistosoma mansoni. These cells resemble planarian neoblasts morphologically and share their ability to proliferate and differentiate into derivatives of multiple germ layers. Capitalizing on available genomic resources(6,7) and RNA-seq-based gene expression profiling, we find that these schistosome neoblast-like cells express a fibroblast growth factor receptor orthologue. Using RNA interference we demonstrate that this gene is required for the maintenance of these neoblast-like cells. Our observations indicate that adaptation of developmental strategies shared by free-living ancestors to modern-day schistosomes probably contributed to the success of these animals as long-lived obligate parasites. We expect that future studies deciphering the function of these neoblast-like cells will have important implications for understanding the biology of these devastating parasites.","[Collins, James J., III; Wang, Bo; Lambrus, Bramwell G.; Tharp, Marla E.; Iyer, Harini; Newmark, Phillip A.] Univ Illinois, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Collins, James J., III; Wang, Bo; Lambrus, Bramwell G.; Tharp, Marla E.; Iyer, Harini; Newmark, Phillip A.] Univ Illinois, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Collins, James J., III; Newmark, Phillip A.] Univ Illinois, Neurosci Program, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Wang, Bo] Univ Illinois, Inst Genom Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Newmark, PA (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",pnewmark@life.illinois.edu,,"Newmark, Phillip/0000-0003-0793-022X","NIAID [HHSN272201000005I]; NIH [F32 HD062124, R21 AI099642]","We thank R.

Although inhibitors of membrane protein smoothened (SMO) effectively suppress HH signalling, early tumour resistance illustrates the need for additional downstream targets for therapy(1-6). Here we identify atypical protein kinase C (aPKC-iota/lambda) as a novel GLI regulator in mammals. aPKC-iota/lambda and its polarity signalling partners' co-localize at the centrosome and form a complex with missing-in-metastasis (MIM), a scaffolding protein that potentiates HH signalling(8,9). Genetic or pharmacological loss of aPKC-iota/lambda function blocks HH signalling and proliferation of BCC cells. Prkci is a HH target gene that forms a positive feedback loop with GLI and exists at increased levels in BCCs. Genome-wide transcriptional profiling shows that aPKC-iota/lambda? and SMO control the expression of similar genes in tumour cells. aPKC-iota/lambda functions downstream of SMO to phosphorylate and activate GLI1, resulting in maximal DNA binding and transcriptional activation. Activated aPKC-iota/lambda. is upregulated in SMO-inhibitor-resistant tumours and targeting aPKC-iota/lambda suppresses signalling and growth of resistant BCC cell lines. These results demonstrate that aPKC-iota/lambda is critical for HH-dependent processes and implicates aPKC-iota/lambda as a new, tumour-selective therapeutic target for the treatment of SMO-inhibitor-resistant cancers.

The constant threat of phage predation has led to the evolution of a broad range of bacterial immunity mechanisms that in turn result in the evolution of diverse phage immune evasion strategies, leading to a dynamic co-evolutionary arms race(2,3). Although bacterial innate immune mechanisms against phage abound, the only documented bacterial adaptive immune system is the CRISPR/Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated proteins) system, which provides sequence-specific protection from invading nudeic acids, including phage(4-11). Here we show a remarkable turn of events, in which a phage-encoded CRISPR/Cas system is used to counteract a phage inhibitory chromosomal island of the bacterial host. A successful lytic infection by the phage is dependent on sequence identity between CRISPR spacers and the target chromosomal island. In the absence of such targeting, the phage-encoded CRISPR/Cas system can acquire new spacers to evolve rapidly and ensure effective targeting of the chromosomal island to restore phage replication.","[Seed, Kimberley D.; Lazinski, David W.; Camilli, Andrew] Tufts Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02111 USA; [Seed, Kimberley D.; Lazinski, David W.; Camilli, Andrew] Tufts Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Microbiol, Boston, MA 02111 USA; [Calderwood, Stephen B.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Div Infect Dis, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Calderwood, Stephen B.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA","Camilli, A (reprint author), Tufts Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02111 USA.",andrew.camilli@tufts.edu,,,"US National Institutes of Health [AI055058, AI045746, AI058935]","The authors thank the Tufts University Core Facility for sequencing and computational support.

CIN is observed in most solid tumours and is associated with both poor prognosis and drug resistance(3,4). Understanding a mechanistic basis for CIN is therefore paramount. Here we find evidence for impaired replication fork progression and increased DNA replication stress in CIN+ colorectal cancer (CRC) cells relative to CIN- CRC cells, with structural chromosome abnormalities precipitating chromosome missegregation in mitosis. We identify three new CIN-suppressor genes (PIGN (also known as MCD4), MEX3C (RKHD2) and ZNF516 (KIAA0222)) encoded on chromosome 18q that are subject to frequent copy number loss in CIN+ CRC. Chromosome 18q loss was temporally associated with aneuploidy onset at the adenoma-carcinoma transition. CIN-suppressor gene silencing leads to DNA replication stress, structural chromosome abnormalities and chromosome missegregation. Supplementing cells with nucleosides, to alleviate replication-associated damage(5), reduces the frequency of chromosome segregation errors after CIN-suppressor gene silencing, and attenuates segregation errors and DNA damage in CIN+ cells. These data implicate a central role for replication stress in the generation of structural and numerical CIN, which may inform new therapeutic approaches to limit intratumour heterogeneity.","[Burrell, Rebecca A.; McClelland, Sarah E.; Endesfelder, David; Shaikh, Nadeem; Kanu, Nnennaya; Dewhurst, Sally M.; Gronroos, Eva; Chew, Su Kit; Rowan, Andrew J.; Howell, Michael; Behrens, Axel; Swanton, Charles] Canc Res UK London Res Inst, London WC2A 3LY, England; [Endesfelder, David; Schenk, Arne; Kschischo, Maik] Univ Appl Sci Koblenz, Dept Math & Technol, D-53424 Remagen, Germany; [Groth, Petra; Weller, Marie-Christine; Helleday, Thomas] Karolinska lnstitutet, Sci Life Lab, Div Translat Med & Chem Biol, Dept Med Biochem & Biophys, S-17121 Stockholm, Sweden; [Domingo, Enric; Tomlinson, Ian R.] Wellcome Trust Ctr Human Genet, Mol & Populat Genet & NIHR Biomed Res Ctr, Oxford OX3 7BN, England; [Chew, Su Kit; Swanton, Charles] UCL Canc Inst, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Sheffer, Michal] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Phys Complex Syst, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Bartek, Jiri] Danish Canc Soc, Res Ctr, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Bartek, Jiri] Palacky Univ Olomouc, Inst Mol & Translat Med, CZ-77515 Olomouc, Czech Republic","Swanton, C (reprint author), Canc Res UK London Res Inst, 44 Lincolns Inn Fields, London WC2A 3LY, England.",charles.swanton@cancer.org.uk,"Gronroos, Eva/E-9351-2013; Helleday, Thomas/D-5224-2013; Bartek, Jiri/G-5870-2014; Gronroos, Eva/P-6951-2015","Helleday, Thomas/0000-0002-7384-092X",Cancer Research UK; Medical Research Council; EU; Prostate Cancer Foundation; Breast Cancer Research Foundation; Oxford Biomedical Research Centre; Danish Cancer Society; Lundbeck Foundation; European Commission; Swedish Cancer Society; Swedish Research Council; Torsten and Ragnar Soderberg Foundation,"We thank A.

Although the functional role for long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) has been best defined in epigenetic phenomena such as X-chromosome inactivation and imprinting, different classes of lncRNAs may have varied biological functions(8-13). We and others have identified a class of lncRNAs, termed ncRNA-activating (ncRNA-a), that function to activate their neighbouring genes using a cis-mediated mechanism(5,14-16). To define the precise mode by which such enhancer-like RNAs function, we depleted factors with known roles in transcriptional activation and assessed their role in RNA-dependent activation. Here we report that depletion of the components of the co-activator complex, Mediator, specifically and potently diminished the ncRNA-induced activation of transcription in a heterologous reporter assay using human HEK293 cells. In vivo, Mediator is recruited to ncRNA-a target genes and regulates their expression. We show that ncRNA-a interact with Mediator to regulate its chromatin localization and kinase activity towards histone H3 serine 10. The Mediator complex harbouring disease-causing MED12 mutations(17,18) displays diminished ability to associate with activating ncRNAs. Chromosome conformation capture confirmed the presence of DNA looping between the ncRNA-a loci and its targets. Importantly, depletion of Mediator subunits or ncRNA-a reduced the chromatin looping between the two loci. Our results identify the human Mediator complex as the transducer of activating ncRNAs and highlight the importance of Mediator and activating ncRNA association in human disease.","[Lai, Fan; Cesaroni, Matteo; Shiekhattar, Ramin] Wistar Inst Anat & Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Orom, Ulf A.] Max Planck Inst Mol Genet, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Beringer, Malte] Ctr Regulacio Genom, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Beringer, Malte] UPF, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Taatjes, Dylan J.] Univ Colorado, Dept Chem & Biochem, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Blobel, Gerd A.] Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Div Hematol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Shiekhattar, R (reprint author), Wistar Inst Anat & Biol, 3601 Spruce St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",shiekhattar@wistar.org,"Beringer, Malte/N-3766-2015","Beringer, Malte/0000-0003-1958-9786; Orom, Ulf/0000-0002-0643-0592",NIH [P30 CA 010815]; NCI [R01 CA127364];  [5R37DK058044],We thank Shiekhattar laboratory members for support and discussions.

Within this complex, TRF2 (also known as TERF2) has a crucial role in end protection through the suppression of ATM activation and the formation of end-to-end chromosome fusions(1,2). Here we address the molecular properties of TRF2 that are both necessary and sufficient to protect chromosome ends in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Our data support a two-step mechanism for TRF2-mediated end protection. First, the dimerization domain of TRF2 is required to inhibit ATM activation, the key initial step involved in the activation of a DNA-damage response (DDR). Next, TRF2 independently suppresses the propagation of DNA-damage signalling downstream of ATM activation. This novel modulation of the DDR at telomeres occurs at the level of the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF168 (ref. 3). Inhibition of RNF168 at telomeres involves the deubiquitinating enzyme BRCC3 and the ubiquitin ligase UBR5, and is sufficient to suppress chromosome end-to-end fusions. This two-step mechanism for TRF2-mediated end protection helps to explain the apparent paradox of frequent localization of DDR proteins at functional telomeres without concurrent induction of detrimental DNA-repair activities.","[Okamoto, Keiji; Bartocci, Cristina; Ouzounov, Iliana; Denchi, Eros Lazzerini] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol & Expt Med, Lab Chromosome Biol & Genom Stabil, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Diedrich, Jolene K.; Yates, John R., III] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Chem Physiol & Cell Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Denchi, EL (reprint author), Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol & Expt Med, Lab Chromosome Biol & Genom Stabil, 10666 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",edenchi@scripps.edu,"lazzerini denchi, eros/F-7913-2010","lazzerini denchi, eros/0000-0001-5378-4644",Pew Scholars Award; Novartis Advanced Discovery Institute; National Institutes of Health [AG038677]; National Center for Research Resources [5P41RR011823-17]; National Institute of General Medical Sciences [8 P41 GM103533-17],"We thank T. de Lange, M.

How HSCs accommodate the diverse cellular stresses associated with their life-long activity remains elusive. Here we identify autophagy as an essential mechanism protecting HSCs from metabolic stress. We show that mouse HSCs, in contrast to their short-lived myeloid progeny, robustly induce autophagy after ex vivo cytokine withdrawal and in vivo calorie restriction. We demonstrate that FOXO3A is critical to maintain a gene expression program that poises HSCs for rapid induction of autophagy upon starvation. Notably, we find that old HSCs retain an intact FOXO3A-driven pro-autophagy gene program, and that ongoing autophagy is needed to mitigate an energy crisis and allow their survival. Our results demonstrate that autophagy is essential for the life-long maintenance of the HSC compartment and for supporting an old, failing blood system.","[Warr, Matthew R.; Binnewies, Mikhail; Flach, Johanna; Reynaud, Damien; Garg, Trit; Passegue, Emmanuelle] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Med, Div Hematol Oncol, Eli & Edythe Broad Ctr Regenerat Med & Stem Cell, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Malhotra, Ritu; Debnath, Jayanta] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pathol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Passegue, E (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Med, Div Hematol Oncol, Eli & Edythe Broad Ctr Regenerat Med & Stem Cell, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",PassegueE@stemcell.ucsf.edu,,"Debnath, Jayanta/0000-0002-8745-4069","Culpepper Scholar Award; NIH [CA126792, HL092471]; CIRM New Faculty Award","We thank A.

The number of reliably measured black-hole masses is small, and the number of methods for measuring them is limited(4), holding back attempts to understand this co-evolution. Directly measuring black-hole masses is currently possible with stellar kinematics (in early-type galaxies), ionized-gas kinematics (in some spiral and early-type galaxies(5-7)) and in rare objects that have central maser emission(8). Here we report that by modelling the effect of a black hole on the kinematics of molecular gas it is possible to fit interferometric observations of CO emission and thereby accurately estimate black-hole masses. We study the dynamics of the gas in the early-type galaxy NGC 4526, and obtain a best fit that requires the presence of a central dark object of 4.5(-3.1)(+4.2) x 10(8) solar masses, (3 sigma confidence limit). With the next-generation millimetre-wavelength interferometers these observations could be reproduced in galaxies out to 75 megaparsecs in less than 5 hours of observing time.

Its counter-intuitive properties are revealed as it propagates in time or space; the quantum probability wave packet preserves its shape despite dispersion or diffraction and propagates along a parabolic caustic trajectory, even though no force is applied. This does not contradict Newton's laws of motion, because the wave packet centroid propagates along a straight line. Nearly 30 years later, this wave packet, known as an accelerating Airy beam, was realized(4) in the optical domain; later it was generalized to an orthogonal and complete family of beams(5) that propagate along parabolic trajectories, as well as to beams that propagate along arbitrary convex trajectories(6). Here we report the experimental generation and observation of the Airy beams of free electrons. These electron Airy beams were generated by diffraction of electrons through a nanoscale hologram(7-9), which imprinted on the electrons' wavefunction a cubic phase modulation in the transverse plane. The highest-intensity lobes of the generated beams indeed followed parabolic trajectories. We directly observed a non-spreading electron wavefunction that self-heals(10), restoring its original shape after passing an obstacle.

At present, reported confining sites consist only of zero-dimensional cavities or weakly linked channels(4).

Two-dimensional transport characteristics are demonstrated by a high electron mobility (520 cm(2) V-1 s(-1)) and long mean scattering time (0.6 picoseconds) with a mean free path of 0.12 micrometres. The quadratic temperature dependence of the resistivity up to 120 Kelvin indicates the presence of an electron-electron interaction. A striking anisotropic magnetoresistance behaviour with respect to the direction of magnetic field (negative for the field perpendicular to the conducting plane and positive for the field parallel to it) is observed, confirming diffusive two-dimensional transport in dense electron layers. Additionally, band calculations support confinement of anionic electrons within the interlayer space, and photoemission measurements confirm anisotropic low work functions of 3.5 and 2.6 electronvolts, revealing the loosely bound nature of the anionic electrons.

Coupled climate-carbon-cycle models generally agree that carbon storage on land will increase as a result of the simultaneous enhancement of plant photosynthesis and water use efficiency under higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations, but will decrease owing to higher soil and plant respiration rates associated with warming temperatures(3). At present, the balance between these effects varies markedly among coupled climate-carbon-cycle models, leading to a range of 330 gigatonnes in the projected change in the amount of carbon stored on tropical land by 2100. Explanations for this large uncertainty include differences in the predicted change in rainfall in Amazonia(4,5) and variations in the responses of alternative vegetation models to warming(6). Here we identify an emergent linear relationship, across an ensemble of models(7), between the sensitivity of tropical land carbon storage to warming and the sensitivity of the annual growth rate of atmospheric CO2 to tropical temperature anomalies(8). Combined with contemporary observations of atmospheric CO2 concentration and tropical temperature, this relationship provides a tight constraint on the sensitivity of tropical land carbon to climate change. We estimate that over tropical land from latitude 30 degrees north to 30 degrees south, warming alone will release 53 +/- 17 gigatonnes of carbon per kelvin. Compared with the unconstrained ensemble of climate-carbon-cycle projections, this indicates a much lower risk of Amazon forest die-back under CO2-induced climate change if CO2 fertilization effects are as large as suggested by current models(9).

Accordingly, speciation is often accompanied by pheromone diversification enabling proper mate finding and recognition(2). Current theory implies that chemical signals are under stabilizing selection by the receivers who thereby maintain the integrity of the signals(3). How the tremendous diversity of sex pheromones seen today evolved is poorly understood(4,5). Here we unravel the genetics of a newly evolved pheromone phenotype in wasps and present results from behavioural experiments indicating how the evolution of a new pheromone component occurred in an established sender-receiver system. We show that male Nasonia vitripennis evolved an additional pheromone compound differing only in its stereochemistry from a pre-existing one. Comparative behavioural studies show that conspecific females responded neutrally to the new pheromone phenotype when it evolved. Genetic mapping and gene knockdown show that a cluster of three closely linked genes accounts for the ability to produce this new pheromone phenotype. Our data suggest that new pheromone compounds can persist in a sender's population, without being selected against by the receiver and without the receiver having a pre-existing preference for the new pheromone phenotype, by initially remaining unperceived. Out results thus contribute valuable new insights into the evolutionary mechanisms underlying the diversification of sex pheromones: Furthermore, they indicate that the genetic basis of new pheromone compounds can be simple, allowing them to persist long enough in a population for receivers to evolve chemosensory adaptations for their exploitation.","[Niehuis, Oliver] Zool Res Museum Alexander Koenig, Ctr Mol Biodivers Res, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Niehuis, Oliver; Buellesbach, Jan; Gibson, Joshua D.; Mutti, Navdeep S.; Judson, Andrea K.; Gadau, Juergen] Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Buellesbach, Jan; Hanner, Christian; Schmitt, Thomas] Univ Freiburg, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Buellesbach, Jan; Schmitt, Thomas] Univ Freiburg, Spemann Grad Sch Biol & Med, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Pothmann, Daniela; Ruther, Joachim] Univ Regensburg, Dept Zool, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany; [Mutti, Navdeep S.] DuPont Pioneer Agr Biotechnol, DuPont Expt Stn, Wilmington, DE 19880 USA; [Schmitt, Thomas] Tech Univ Darmstadt, Ecol Network Grp, D-64287 Darmstadt, Germany","Niehuis, O (reprint author), Zool Res Museum Alexander Koenig, Ctr Mol Biodivers Res, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",o.niehuis.zfmk@uni-bonn.de,"Schmitt, Thomas/H-3033-2013",,Alexander von Humboldt foundation; Excellence Initiative of the German Research Foundation (Spemann Graduate School) [GSC-4]; German Research Foundation (DFG) [RU 717/10-1],"We thank J.

Large-scale, warm droughts have recently occurred in North America, Africa, Europe, Amazonia and Australia, resulting in major effects on terrestrial ecosystems, carbon balance and food security(2,3). Here we compare the functional response of above-ground net primary production to contrasting hydroclimatic periods in the late twentieth century (1975-1998), and drier, warmer conditions in the early twenty-first century (2000-2009) in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. We find a common ecosystem water-use efficiency (WUEe: above-ground net primary production/evapotranspiration) across biomes ranging from grassland to forest that indicates an intrinsic system sensitivity to water availability across rainfall regimes, regardless of hydroclimatic conditions. We found higher WUEe in drier years that increased significantly with drought to a maximum WUEe across all biomes; and a minimum native state in wetter years that was common across hydroclimatic periods. This indicates biome-scale resilience to the interannual variability associated with the early twenty-first century drought-that is, the capacity to tolerate low, annual precipitation and to respond to subsequent periods of favourable water balance. These findings provide a conceptual model of ecosystem properties at the decadal scale applicable to the widespread altered hydroclimatic conditions that are predicted for later this century. Understanding the hydroclimatic threshold that will break down ecosystem resilience and alter maximum WUEe may allow us to predict land-surface consequences as large regions become more arid, starting with water-limited, low-productivity grasslands.","[Campos, Guillermo E.

Such behaviours are vulnerable to the rise of mutants that benefit from the collective action without contributing to it; how these behaviours can be evolutionarily stable is not well understood(1). We address this question using the intestinal pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (hereafter termed S. typhimurium), which manipulates its host to induce inflammation, and thereby outcompetes the commensal microbiota(2,3). Notably, the virulence factors needed for host manipulation are expressed in a bistable fashion, leading to a slow-growing subpopulation that expresses virulence genes, and a fast-growing subpopulation that is phenotypically avirulent(4,5). Here we show that the expression of the genetically identical but phenotypically avirulent subpopulation is essential for the evolutionary stability of virulence in this pathogen. Using a combination of mathematical modelling, experimental evolution and competition experiments we found that within-host evolution leads to the emergence of mutants that are genetically avirulent and fast-growing. These mutants are defectors that exploit inflammation without contributing to it. In infection experiments initiated with wild-type S. typhimurium, defectors increase only slowly in frequency. In a genetically modified S. typhimurium strain in which the phenotypically avirulent subpopulation is reduced in size, defectors rise more rapidly, inflammation ceases prematurely, and S. typhimurium is quickly cleared from the gut. Our results establish that host manipulation by S. typhimurium is a cooperative trait that is vulnerable to the rise of avirulent defectors; the expression of a phenotypically avirulent subpopulation that grows as fast as defectors slows down this process, and thereby promotes the evolutionary stability of virulence. This points to a key role of bistable virulence gene expression in stabilizing cooperative virulence and may lead the way to new approaches, for controlling pathogens.","[Diard, Mederic; Maier, Lisa; Remus-Emsermann, Mitja N.

Alternatively, the evolution of high surface-to-volume ratios coupled with minimal genomes containing high-affinity transporters enables unusually efficient metabolism for oxidizing dissolved organic matter in the world's oceans that could support vast population sizes despite phage susceptibility. These ideas are important for understanding plankton ecology because they emphasize the potentially important role of top-down mechanisms in predation, thus determining the size of SAR11 populations and their concomitant role in biogeochemical cycling. Here we report the isolation of diverse SAR11 viruses belonging to two virus families in culture, for which we propose the name 'pelagiphage', after their host. Notably; the pelagiphage genomes were highly represented in marine viral metagenomes, demonstrating their importance in nature. One of the new phages, HTVC010P, represents a new podovirus subfamily more abundant than any seen previously, in all data sets tested, and may represent one of the most abundant virus subfamilies in the biosphere. This discovery disproves the theory that SAR11 cells are immune to viral predation and is consistent with the interpretation that the success of this highly abundant microbial clade is the result of successfully evolved adaptation to resource competition.","[Zhao, Yanlin; Temperton, Ben; Thrash, J.

However, efficient inhibition of exponential cancer growth by T cells and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) requires additional undefined mechanisms that arrest cancer cell proliferation(1-5,12,13). Here we show that the combined action of the T-helper-1-cell cytokines IFN-gamma and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) directly induces permanent growth arrest in cancers. To safely separate senescence induced by tumour immunity from oncogene-induced senescence(9-11,14-17), we used a mouse model in which the Simian virus 40 large T antigen (Tag) expressed under the control of the rat insulin promoter creates tumours by attenuating p53- and Rb-mediated cell cycle control(18,19). When combined, IFN-gamma and TNF drive Tag-expressing cancers into senescence by inducing permanent growth arrest in G1/G0, activation of p16INK4a (also known as CDKN2A), and downstream Rb hypophosphorylation at serine 795. This cytokine-induced senescence strictly requires STAT1 and TNFR1 (also known as TNFRSF1A) signalling in addition to p16INK4a. In vivo, Tag-specific T-helper 1 cells permanently arrest Tag-expressing cancers by inducing IFN-gamma- and TNFR1-dependent senescence. Conversely, Tnfr1(-/-) Tag-expressing cancers resist cytokine-induced senescence and grow aggressively, even in TNFR1-expressing hosts. Finally, as IFN-gamma and TNF induce senescence in numerous murine and human cancers, this may be a general mechanism for arresting cancer progression.","[Braumueller, Heidi; Wieder, Thomas; Brenner, Ellen; Assmann, Sonja; Hahn, Matthias; Kneilling, Manfred; Griessinger, Christoph; Braungart, Kilian; Mehra, Tarun; Fehrenbacher, Birgit; Berdel, Julia; Niessner, Heike; Meier, Friedegund; Bauer, Juergen; Schaller, Martin; Roecken, Martin] Univ Tubingen, Dept Dermatol, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Alkhaled, Mohammed; Schilbach, Karin; Handgretinger, Rupert] Univ Tubingen, Dept Gen Pediat, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Essmann, Frank] Univ Tubingen, Interfac Inst Biochem, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Griessinger, Christoph] Univ Tubingen, Dept Preclin Imaging & Radiopharm, Werner Siemens Fdn, Lab Preclin Imaging & Imaging Technol, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Ranta, Felicia; Ullrich, Susanne; Haering, Hans-Ulrich] Univ Tubingen, Dept Internal Med 6, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Mocikat, Ralph] Deutsch Forschungszentrum Gesundheit & Umwelt, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Inst Mol Immunol, D-81377 Munich, Germany; [van den Broek, Maries] Univ Zurich Hosp, Clin Oncol, CH-8091 Zurich, Switzerland; [Handgretinger, Rupert; Fend, Falko; Schulze-Osthoff, Klaus; Roecken, Martin] German Canc Consortium DKTK, Comprehens Canc Ctr Tubingen, D-72070 Tubingen, Germany; [Quintanilla-Martinez, Leticia; Fend, Falko] Univ Tubingen, Dept Pathol, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Pesic, Marina; Zender, Lars] Univ Tubingen, Dept Internal Med 1, Div Mol Oncol Solid Tumors, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany","Rocken, M (reprint author), Univ Tubingen, Dept Dermatol, Liebermeister Str 25, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany.",mrocken@med.uni-tuebingen.de,"Schulze-Osthoff, Klaus/N-9025-2013; Alkhaled, Mohammed/D-3026-2016; Bauer, Jurgen/B-4656-2008","Schulze-Osthoff, Klaus/0000-0003-1443-2720; Bauer, Jurgen/0000-0001-8789-1536","Sander Stiftung [2005.043.2, 2005.043.3]; Deutsche Krebshilfe [109037]; IZKF-Promotionskolleg 'Molekulare Medizin' [1886-0-0, PK 2011-3, PK 2012-1]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB 685, SFB 773, Wi 1279/3-1]; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)","The authors thank A.

Tumours that express high levels of APOBEC3B have twice as many mutations as those that express low levels and are more likely to have mutations in TP53. Endogenous APOBEC3B protein is predominantly nuclear and the only detectable source of DNA C-to-U editing activity in breast cancer cell-line extracts. Knockdown experiments show that endogenous APOBEC3B correlates with increased levels of genomic uracil, increased mutation frequencies, and C-to-T transitions. Furthermore, induced APOBEC3B overexpression causes cell cycle deviations, cell death, DNA fragmentation, gamma-H2AX accumulation and C-to-T mutations. Our data suggest a model in which APOBEC3B-catalysed deamination provides a chronic source of DNA damage in breast cancers that could select TP53 inactivation and explain how some tumours evolve rapidly and manifest heterogeneity.","[Burns, Michael B.; Lackey, Lela; Carpenter, Michael A.; Rathore, Anurag; Land, Allison M.; Refsland, Eric W.; McDougle, Rebecca M.; Brown, William L.; Law, Emily K.; Harris, Reuben S.] Univ Minnesota, Biochem Mol Biol & Biophys Dept, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Burns, Michael B.; Lackey, Lela; Carpenter, Michael A.; Rathore, Anurag; Land, Allison M.; Leonard, Brandon; Refsland, Eric W.; Kotandeniya, Delshanee; Tretyakova, Natalia; Nikas, Jason B.; Yee, Douglas; McDougle, Rebecca M.; Brown, William L.; Law, Emily K.; Harris, Reuben S.] Univ Minnesota, Masonic Canc Ctr, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Burns, Michael B.; Lackey, Lela; Carpenter, Michael A.; Rathore, Anurag; Land, Allison M.; Leonard, Brandon; Refsland, Eric W.; McDougle, Rebecca M.; Brown, William L.; Law, Emily K.; Harris, Reuben S.] Univ Minnesota, Inst Mol Virol, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Burns, Michael B.; Lackey, Lela; Carpenter, Michael A.; Rathore, Anurag; Land, Allison M.; Leonard, Brandon; Refsland, Eric W.; McDougle, Rebecca M.; Brown, William L.; Law, Emily K.; Harris, Reuben S.] Univ Minnesota, Ctr Genome Engn, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Leonard, Brandon; Harris, Reuben S.] Univ Minnesota, Microbiol Canc Biol & Immunol Grad Program, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Kotandeniya, Delshanee; Tretyakova, Natalia] Univ Minnesota, Dept Med Chem, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Temiz, Nuri I.

Activation of the non-canonical NF-kappa B pathway involves degradation of an inhibitory protein, TNF receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3), but how this signalling event is controlled is still unknown(1,2). Here we have identified the deubiquitinase OTUD7B as a pivotal regulator of the non-canonical NF-kappa B pathway. OTUD7B deficiency in mice has no appreciable effect on canonical NF-kappa B activation but causes hyperactivation of non-canonical NF-kappa B. In response to non-canonical NF-kappa B stimuli, OTUD7B binds and deubiquitinates TRAF3, thereby inhibiting TRAF3 proteolysis and preventing aberrant non-canonical NF-kappa B activation. Consequently, the OTUD7B deficiency results in B-cell hyper-responsiveness to antigens, lymphoid follicular hyperplasia in the intestinal mucosa, and elevated host-defence ability against an intestinal bacterial pathogen, Citrobacter rodentium. These findings establish OTUD7B as a crucial regulator of signal-induced non-canonical NF-kappa B activation and indicate a mechanism of immune regulation that involves OTUD7B-mediated deubiquitination and stabilization of TRAF3.","[Hu, Hongbo; Brittain, George C.; Chang, Jae-Hoon; Puebla-Osorio, Nahum; Jin, Jin; Zal, Anna; Xiao, Yichuan; Cheng, Xuhong; Chang, Mikyoung; Zal, Tomasz; Zhu, Chengming; Sun, Shao-Cong] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Immunol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Fu, Yang-Xin] Univ Chicago, Dept Pathol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Zal, Tomasz; Zhu, Chengming; Sun, Shao-Cong] Univ Texas Houston, Grad Sch Biomed Sci, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Sun, SC (reprint author), Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Immunol, 7455 Fannin St,Box 902, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",ssun@mdanderson.org,"Hu, Hongbo/J-8059-2016","Hu, Hongbo/0000-0002-8177-7641; fu, yang-xin/0000-0001-8441-6617","National Institutes of Health [AI057555, AI064639, GM84459, CA137059, T32CA009598]; Sister Institution Network Fund of MD Anderson Cancer Center","We thank Z.

Although skeletal muscle accounts for 70-90% of insulin-stimulated glucose disposal(2,3), the mechanism underlying muscle insulin resistance is poorly understood. Here we show in mice that muscle-specific mitsugumin 53 (MG53; also called TRIM72) mediates the degradation of the insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1); and when upregulated, causes metabolic syndrome featuring insulin resistance, obesity, hypertension and dyslipidaemia. MG53 expression is markedly elevated in models of insulin resistance, and MG53 overexpression suffices to trigger muscle insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome sequentially. Conversely, ablation of MG53 prevents diet-induced metabolic syndrome by preserving the insulin receptor, IRS1 and insulin signalling integrity. Mechanistically, MG53 acts as an E3 ligase targeting the insulin receptor and IRS1 for ubiquitin-dependent degradation, comprising a central mechanism controlling insulin signal strength in skeletal muscle. These findings define MG53 as a novel therapeutic target for treating metabolic disorders and associated cardiovascular complications.","[Song, Ruisheng; Peng, Wei; Zhang, Yan; Lv, Fengxiang; Wu, Hong-Kun; Guo, Jiaojiao; Jin, Li; Zhang, Mao; Jiang, Peng; Liu, Fenghua; Meng, Shaoshuai; Zhang, Xiuqin; Jiang, Ping; Cao, Chun-Mei; Xiao, Rui-Ping] Peking Univ, Inst Mol Med, State Key Lab Biomembrane & Membrane Biotechnol, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Song, Ruisheng] Peking Univ, Hlth Sci Ctr, Inst Cardiovasc Sci, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Cao, Yongxing; Pi, Yanbin; Zhang, Xin] Peking Univ, Hosp 3, Inst Sports Med, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Rui-Ping] Peking Univ, Ctr Life Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China","Xiao, RP (reprint author), Peking Univ, Inst Mol Med, State Key Lab Biomembrane & Membrane Biotechnol, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",caochunmei@pku.edu.cn; xiaor@pku.edu.cn,,/0000-0002-6856-4721,"National Basic Research Program of China [2012CB518000, 2013CB531200, 2012CB944501]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [81070674, 81070116, 3/22/002, 81130073]","We thank H.

These bacteria oxidize methane to methanol by soluble and particulate methane monooxygenases (MMOs)(1-4). Soluble MMO contains three protein components, a 251-kilodalton hydroxylase (MMOH), a 38.6-kilodalton reductase (MMOR), and a 15.9-kilodalton regulatory protein (MMOB), required to couple electron consumption with substrate hydroxylation at the catalytic diiron centre of MMOH2. Until now, the role of MMOB has remained ambiguous owing to a lack of atomic-level information about the MMOH-MMOB (hereafter termed H-B) complex. Here we remedy this deficiency by providing a crystal structure of H-B, which reveals the manner by which MMOB controls the conformation of residues in MMOH crucial for substrate access to the active site. MMOB docks at the alpha(2)beta(2) interface of alpha(2)beta(2)gamma(2) MMOH, and triggers simultaneous conformational changes in the alpha-subunit that modulate oxygen and methane access as well as proton delivery to the diiron centre. Without such careful control by MMOB of these substrate routes to the diiron active site, the enzyme operates as an NADH oxidase rather than a monooxygenases(5). Biological catalysis involving small substrates is often accomplished in nature by large proteins and protein complexes. The structure presented in this work provides an elegant example of this principle.","[Lee, Seung Jae; McCormick, Michael S.; Lippard, Stephen J.] MIT, Dept Chem, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Cho, Uhn-Soo] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem & Mol Pharmacol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Lippard, SJ (reprint author), MIT, Dept Chem, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",lippard@mit.edu; uhnsoo@med.umich.edu,,"cho, uhn-soo/0000-0002-6992-2455",National Institute of General Medical Sciences [GM 32114],"This work was supported by grant GM 32114 from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences to S.

The few available structures of the eukaryotic ribosome(1-6) reveal that it is more complex than its prokaryotic counterpart(7,8), owing mainly to the presence of eukaryote-specific ribosomal proteins and additional ribosomal RNA insertions, called expansion segments(9). The structures also differ among species, partly in the size and arrangement of these expansion segments. Such differences are extreme in kinetoplastids, unicellular eukaryotic parasites often infectious to humans. Here we present a high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of the ribosome of Trypanosoma brucei, the parasite that is transmitted by the tsetse fly and that causes African sleeping sickness. The atomic model reveals the unique features of this ribosome, characterized mainly by the presence of unusually large expansion segments and ribosomal-protein extensions leading to the formation of four additional inter-subunit bridges. We also find additional rRNA insertions, including one large rRNA domain that is not found in other eukaryotes. Furthermore, the structure reveals the five cleavage sites of the kinetoplastid large ribosomal subunit (LSU) rRNA chain, which is known to be cleaved uniquely into six pieces(10-12), and suggests that the cleavage is important for the maintenance of the T. brucei ribosome in the observed structure. We discuss several possible implications of the large rRNA expansion segments for the translation-regulation process. The structure could serve as a basis for future experiments aimed at understanding the functional importance of these kinetoplastid-specific ribosomal features in protein-translation regulation, an essential step towards finding effective and safe kinetoplastid-specific drugs.","[Hashem, Yaser; Georges, Amedee des; Grassucci, Robert A.; Frank, Joachim] Columbia Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, Howard Hughes Med Inst HHMI, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Fu, Jie; Liao, Hstau Y.; Frank, Joachim] Columbia Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Buss, Sarah N.; Madison-Antenucci, Susan] New York State Dept Hlth, Div Infect Dis, Wadsworth Ctr, Albany, NY 12201 USA; [Jossinet, Fabrice; Westhof, Eric] Univ Strasbourg, Inst Biol Mol & Cellulaire CNRS, Architecture & Reactivite ARN, F-67084 Strasbourg, France; [Jobe, Amy; Frank, Joachim] Columbia Univ, Dept Biol Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Zhang, Qin; Bajaj, Chandrajit] Univ Texas Austin, Inst Computat Engn & Sci, Dept Comp Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Frank, J (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, Howard Hughes Med Inst HHMI, 630 W 168th St, New York, NY 10032 USA.",jf2192@columbia.edu,"des Georges, Amedee/C-3588-2014","des Georges, Amedee/0000-0002-9704-3781; Madison-Antenucci, Susan/0000-0003-1748-9327","Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI); National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R01 GM29169]; L'Agence Nationale de la recherche (ANR) project AMIS ARN [ANR-09-BLAN-0160]; NIH [R01-EB004873, R01-GM074258]; Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Emerging Infectious Diseases (EID) fellowship program","This work is dedicated to the memory of Mariano Levin, who collaborated with J.F. and S.M.A. on the ribosomes from T. cruzi and T. brucei.

The little-studied Marion Rise is as large as the Icelandic Rise, considering both length and depth, but has an axial rift (rather than a high) nearly its entire length. Uniquely along the Southwest Indian Ridge systematic sampling allows direct examination of crustal architecture over its full length. Here we show that, unlike the Icelandic Rise, peridotites are extensively exposed high on the rise, revealing that the crust is generally thin, and often missing, over a rifted rise. Therefore the Marion Rise must be largely an isostatic response to ancient melting events that created low-density depleted mantle beneath the Southwest Indian Ridge rather than thickened crust or a large thermal anomaly. The origin of this depleted mantle is probably the mantle emplaced into the African asthenosphere during the Karoo and Madagascar flood basalt events.","[Zhou, Huaiyang] Tongji Univ, State Key Lab Marine Geol, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; [Dick, Henry J.

Accordingly, agents that induce autophagy may have broad therapeutic applications. One approach to developing such agents is to exploit autophagy manipulation strategies used by microbial virulence factors. Here we show that a peptide, Tat-beclin 1-derived from a region of the autophagy protein, beclin 1, which binds human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 Nef-is a potent inducer of autophagy, and interacts with a newly identified negative regulator of autophagy, GAPR-1 (also called GLIPR2). Tat-beclin 1 decreases the accumulation of polyglutamine expansion protein aggregates and the replication of several pathogens (including HIV-1) in vitro, and reduces mortality in mice infected with chikungunya or West Nile virus. Thus, through the characterization of a domain of beclin 1 that interacts with HIV-1 Nef, we have developed an autophagy-inducing peptide that has potential efficacy in the treatment of human diseases.","[Shoji-Kawata, Sanae; Sumpter, Rhea, Jr.; Leveno, Matthew; Zou, Zhongju; Sun, Qihua; Pallauf, Kathrin; Levine, Beth] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Internal Med, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Shoji-Kawata, Sanae; Sumpter, Rhea, Jr.; Leveno, Matthew; Zou, Zhongju; Sun, Qihua; Levine, Beth] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Ctr Autophagy Res, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Campbell, Grant R.; Spector, Stephen A.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Pediat, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Campbell, Grant R.; Spector, Stephen A.] Rady Childrens Hosp, San Diego, CA 92123 USA; [Zou, Zhongju; Kinch, Lisa; Grishin, Nick V.; Levine, Beth] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Kinch, Lisa; Huerta, Carlos; Grishin, Nick V.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Biochem, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Wilkins, Angela D.; Lichtarge, Olivier] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Human Genet, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [MacDuff, Donna; Virgin, Herbert W.; Lenschow, Deborah J.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Immunol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Helms, J.

The southern hemisphere is dominated by a giant impact scar(5), but previous impact models(6-8) have failed to reproduce the observed topography. The recent discovery that Vesta's southern hemisphere is dominated by two overlapping basins' provides an opportunity to model Vesta's topography more accurately. Here we report three-dimensional simulations of Vesta's global evolution under two overlapping planet-scale collisions. We closely reproduce its observed shape, and provide maps of impact excavation and ejecta deposition. Spiral patterns observed in the younger basin Rheasilvia(9), about one billion years old(10), are attributed to Coriolis forces during crater collapse. Surface materials exposed in the north come from a depth of about 20 kilometres, according to our models, whereas materials exposed inside the southern double-excavation come from depths of about 60-100 kilometres. If Vesta began as a layered, completely differentiated protoplanet, then our model predicts large areas of pure diogenites and olivine-rich rocks. These are not seen(11-13), possibly implying that the outer 100 kilometres or so of Vesta is composed mainly of a basaltic crust (eucrites) with ultramafic intrusions (diogenites).","[Jutzi, M.; Benz, W.] Univ Bern, Inst Phys, Ctr Space & Habitabil, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Asphaug, E.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Earth & Space Explorat, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Gillet, P.] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Inst Condensed Matter Phys, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Barrat, J. -A.] Univ Bretagne Occidentale, Inst Univ Europeen Mer, CNRS, UMR 6538, F-29280 Plouzane, France","Jutzi, M (reprint author), Univ Bern, Inst Phys, Ctr Space & Habitabil, Sidlerstr 5, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",martin.jutzi@space.unibe.ch,,,Ambizione programme of the Swiss National Science Foundation; NASA's Planetary Geology and Geophysics Program; Programme National de Planetologie de l'JNSU; Swiss National Science Foundation,M.J. acknowledges support from the Ambizione programme of the Swiss National Science Foundation.

Well-known examples include cavity quantum electrodynamics(1), trapped ions(2), and electrons and phonons in the solid state. In those systems, strong coupling makes the constituents lose their individual character and form dressed states, which represent a collective form of dynamics. As well as having fundamental importance, hybrid systems also have practical applications, notably in the emerging field of quantum information control. A promising approach is to combine long-lived atomic states(2,3) with the accessible electrical degrees of freedom in superconducting cavities and quantum bits(4,5) (qubits). Here we integrate circuit cavity quantum electrodynamics(6,7) with phonons. Apart from coupling to a microwave cavity, our superconducting transmon qubit(8), consisting of tunnel junctions and a capacitor, interacts with a phonon mode in a micromechanical resonator, and thus acts like an atom coupled to two different cavities. We measure the phonon Stark shift, as well as the splitting of the qubit spectral line into motional sidebands, which feature transitions between the dressed electromechanical states. In the time domain, we observe coherent conversion of qubit excitation to phonons as sideband Rabi oscillations. This is a model system with potential for a quantum interface, which may allow for storage of quantum information in long-lived phonon states, coupling to optical photons or for investigations of strongly coupled quantum systems near the classical limit.","[Pirkkalainen, J. -M.; Cho, S.

The ideal catalyst should not contain precious elements' and should bring reactions to completion in a few hours through operationally simple procedures. Here we introduce a set of small organic molecules that can catalyse reactions of unsaturated organoboron reagents with imines and carbonyls; the products of the reactions are enantiomerically pure amines and alcohols, which might serve as intermediates in the preparation of biologically active molecules. A distinguishing feature of this catalyst class is the presence of a 'key' proton embedded within their structure. Catalysts are derived from the abundant amino add valine and are prepared in large quantities in four steps with inexpensive reagents. Reactions are scalable, do not demand stringent conditions, and can be performed with as little as 0.25 mole per cent catalyst in less than six hours at room temperature to generate products in more than 85 per cent yield and >= 97:3 enantiomeric ratio. The efficiency, selectivity and operational simplicity of the transformations and the range of boron-based reagents are expected to render this advance important for future progress in syntheses of amines and alcohols, which are useful in chemistry, biology and medicine.","[Silverio, Daniel L.; Torker, Sebastian; Pilyugina, Tatiana; Vieira, Erika M.; Snapper, Marc L.; Haeffner, Fredrik; Hoveyda, Amir H.] Boston Coll, Dept Chem, Merkert Chem Ctr, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA","Hoveyda, AH (reprint author), Boston Coll, Dept Chem, Merkert Chem Ctr, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA.",amir.hoveyda@bc.edu,"Silverio, Daniel/C-4953-2016","Silverio, Daniel/0000-0003-3240-2816","US National Institutes of Health, Institute of General Medical Sciences [GM-57212]","This research was supported by the US National Institutes of Health, Institute of General Medical Sciences (grant GM-57212).

The interglacials after 430,000 years ago were characterized by warmer climates(1,2) and higher atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide(3) than the interglacials before, but the cause of this climatic transition (the so-called mid-Brunhes event (MBE)) is unknown. Here I show, on the basis of model simulations, that in response to insolation changes only, feedbacks between sea ice, temperature, evaporation and salinity caused vigorous pre-MBE Antarctic bottom water formation and Southern Ocean ventilation. My results also show that strong westerlies increased the pre-MBE overturning in the Southern Ocean via an increased latitudinal insolation gradient created by changes in eccentricity during austral winter and by changes in obliquity during austral summer. The stronger bottom water formation led to a cooler deep ocean during the older interglacials. These insolation-induced differences in the deep-sea temperature and in the Southern Ocean ventilation between the more recent interglacials and the older ones were not expected, because there is no straightforward systematic difference in the astronomical parameters between the Interglacials before and after 430,000 years ago(4). Rather than being a real 'event', the apparent MBE seems to have resulted from a series of individual interglacial responses including notable exceptions to the general pattern to various combinations of insolation conditions. Consequently, assuming no anthropogenic interference, future interglacials may have pre- or post-MBE characteristics without there being a systematic change in forcings. These findings are a first step towards understanding the magnitude change of the interglacial carbon dioxide concentration around 430,000 years ago.","Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Georges Lemaitre Ctr Earth & Climate Res, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium","Yin, QZ (reprint author), Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Georges Lemaitre Ctr Earth & Climate Res, Chemin Cyclotron 2, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium.",qiuzhen.yin@uclouvain.be,,,"European Research Council [227348]; Belgian National Fund for Scientific Research (FRS-FNRS); S.

Rhachitomous vertebrae(2)-in which there is a dorsally placed neural arch and spine, an anteroventially placed intercentrum and paired, posterodorsally placed pleurocentra have long been considered the ancestral morphology for tetrapods(1,3-6). Nonetheless, very little is known about vertebral anatomy in the earliest stem tetrapods, because most specimens remain trapped in surrounding matrix, obscuring Important anatomical features(7-9). Here we describe the three-dimensional vertebral architecture of the Late Devonian stem tetrapod Ichthyostega using propagation phase-contrast X-ray synchrotron. microtomography. Our scans reveal a diverse array of new morphological, and associated developmental and functional, characteristics, including a possible posterior-to-anterior vertebral ossification sequence and the first evolutionary appearance of ossified sternal elements. One of the most intriguing features relates to the positional relationships between the vertebral elements, with the pleurocentra being unexpectedly sutured or fused to the intercentra that directly succeed them, indicating a 'reverse' rhachitomous design(10). Comparison of Ichthyostega with two other stem tetrapods, Acanthostegi and Pederpess, shows that reverse rhachitomous vertebrae may be the ancestral condition for limbed vertebrates. This study fundamentally revises our current understanding' of vertebral column evolution in the earliest tetrapods and raises questions about the presumed vertebral architecture of tetrapodomorph fish(12,13) and later, more crownward, tetrapods.","[Pierce, Stephanie E.; Clack, Jennifer A.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Univ Museum Zool, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England; [Pierce, Stephanie E.; Hutchinson, John R.; Molnar, Julia L.] Univ London Royal Vet Coll, Dept Comparat Biomed Sci, Hatfield AL9 7TA, Herts, England; [Pierce, Stephanie E.; Hutchinson, John R.; Molnar, Julia L.] Univ London Royal Vet Coll, Struct & Mot Lab, Hatfield AL9 7TA, Herts, England; [Ahlberg, Per E.; Sanchez, Sophie] Uppsala Univ, Subdept Evolut & Dev, Dept Organismal Biol, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden; [Sanchez, Sophie; Tafforeau, Paul] European Synchrotron Radiat Facil, F-38043 Grenoble, France","Pierce, SE (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Univ Museum Zool, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England.",spierce@rvc.ac.uk,"Ahlberg, Per/E-8086-2013","Hutchinson, John/0000-0002-6767-7038","NERC [NE/G005877/1, NE/G00711X/1]; ERC [233111]","We thank the European Synchrotron Radiation facility (ESRF) in Grenoble, France, for access to beamline ID19; S.

Over the past decade, a growing number of studies have reported negative correlations between host biodiversity and disease risk(4-8), prompting suggestions that biodiversity conservation could promote human and wildlife health(9,10). Yet the generality of the diversity-disease linkage remains conjectural(11-13), in part because empirical evidence of a relationship between host competence (the ability to maintain and transmit infections) and the order in which communities assemble has proven elusive. Here we integrate high-resolution field data with multi-scale experiments to show that host diversity inhibits transmission of the virulent pathogen Ribeiroia ondatrae and reduces amphibian disease as a result of consistent linkages among species richness, host composition and community competence. Surveys of 345 wetlands indicated that community composition changed nonrandomly with species richness, such that highly competent hosts dominated in species-poor assemblages whereas more resistant species became progressively more common in diverse assemblages. As a result, amphibian species richness strongly moderated pathogen transmission and disease pathology among 24,215 examined hosts, with a 78.4% decline in realized transmission in richer assemblages. Laboratory and mesocosm manipulations revealed an approximately 50% decrease in pathogen transmission and host pathology across a realistic diversity gradient while controlling for host density, helping to establish mechanisms underlying the diversity-disease relationship and their consequences for host fitness. By revealing a consistent link between species richness and community competence, these findings highlight the influence of biodiversity on infection risk and emphasize the benefit of a community-based approach to understanding infectious diseases.","[Johnson, Pieter T.

Multiple explanations for this 'missing heritability' have been proposed(1). Here we use a large cross between two yeast strains to accurately estimate different sources of heritable variation for 46 quantitative traits, and to detect underlying loci with high statistical power. We find that the detected loci explain nearly the entire additive contribution to heritable variation for the traits studied.

The prevailing model of basal ganglia function proposes that two orthogonal projection circuits originating from distinct populations of spiny projection neurons (SPNs) in the striatum(5,6)-the so-called direct and indirect pathways have opposing effects on movement: activity of direct-pathway SPNs is thought to facilitate movement, whereas activity of indirect-pathway SPNs is presumed to inhibit movement(1,2). This model has been difficult to test owing to the lack of methods to selectively measure the activity of direct- and indirect-pathway SPNs in freely moving animals: Here we develop a novel in vivo method to specifically measure direct- and indirect-pathway SPN activity, using Cre-dependent viral expression of the genetically encoded calcium indicator (GECI) GCaMP3 in the dorsal striatum of D1-Cre (direct-pathway-specific(6,7)) and A2A-Cre (indirect-pathway-specific(8,9)) mice. Using fibre optics and time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) in mice performing an operant task, we observed transient-increases in neural activity in both direct- and indirect-pathway SPNs when animals initiated actions, but not when they were inactive. Concurrent activation of SPNs from both pathways in one hemisphere preceded the initiation of contraversive movements and predicted the occurrence of specific movements within 500 ms. These observations challenge the classical view of basal ganglia function and may have implications for understanding the origin of motor symptoms in basal ganglia disorders.","[Cui, Guohong; Jin, Xin; Pham, Michael D.; Lovinger, David M.; Costa, Rui M.] NIAAA, Sect Vivo Neural Funct, Lab Integrat Neurosci, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Jun, Sang Beom] Ewha Womans Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Seoul 120750, South Korea; [Jin, Xin] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Mol Neurobiol Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Vogel, Steven S.] NIAAA, Sect Cellular Biophoton, Lab Mol Physiol, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Lovinger, David M.] NIAAA, Sect Synapt Pharmacol, Lab Integrat Neurosci, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Costa, Rui M.] Inst Gulbenkian Ciencias, Champalimaud Neurosci Programme, P-1400038 Lisbon, Portugal; [Costa, Rui M.] Champalimaud Ctr Unknown, P-1400038 Lisbon, Portugal","Vogel, SS (reprint author), NIAAA, Sect Cellular Biophoton, Lab Mol Physiol, NIH, 5625 Fishers Lane, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",stevevog@mail.nih.gov; lovindav@mail.nih.gov; ruicosta@fchampalimaud.org,,"Vogel, Steven/0000-0002-3005-2667; Costa, Rui/0000-0003-0495-8374","Division of Intramural Clinical and Biological Research of the NIAAA; European Research Council [STG 243393]; International Early Career Scientist grant from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute; National Research Foundation of Korea [2011-0029485, 2012-0004003]; SmartIT Convergence System Research Center from the Korean government (MEST) [SIRC-2011-0031866]; Ellison Medical Foundation [AG-NS-0944-12]","We thank C.

In the eye, there is simultaneous regression of embryonic hyaloid vasculature(1) (important to clear the optical path) and formation of the retinal vasculature (important for the high metabolic demands of retinal neurons). These events occur postnatally in the mouse. Here we have identified a light-response pathway that regulates both processes. We show that when mice are mutated in the gene (Opn4) for the atypical opsin melanopsin(3-5), or are dark-reared from late gestation, the hyaloid vessels are persistent at 8 days post-partum and the retinal vasculature overgrows. We provide evidence that these vascular anomalies are explained by a light-response pathway that suppresses retinal neuron number, limits hypoxia and, as a consequence, holds local expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFA) in check. We also show that the light response for this pathway occurs in late gestation at about embryonic day 16 and requires the photopigment in the fetus and not the mother. Measurements show that visceral cavity photon flux is probably sufficient to activate melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells in the mouse fetus. These data thus show that light the stimulus for function of the mature eye is also critical in preparing the eye for vision by regulating retinal neuron number and initiating a series of events that ultimately pattern the ocular blood vessels.","[Rao, Sujata; Fan, Jieqing; Yang, Michael B.; Lang, Richard A.] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Pediat Ophthalmol, Abrahamson Pediat Eye Inst, Visual Syst Grp, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Chun, Christina; Copenhagen, David R.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Ophthalmol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Chun, Christina; Copenhagen, David R.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Physiol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Kofron, J.

A three-dimensional culture system allows long-term clonal expansion of single Lgr5(+) stem cells into transplantable organoids (budding cysts) that retain many characteristics of the original epithelial architecture(2,4,5). A crucial component of the culture medium is the Wnt agonist RSPO1(6), the recently discovered ligand of LGR5(7,8). Here we show that Lgr5-lacZ is not expressed in healthy adult liver, however, small Lgr5-LacZ(+) cells appear near bile ducts upon damage, coinciding with robust activation of Wnt signalling. As shown by mouse lineage tracing using a new Lgr5-IRES-creERT2 knock-in allele, damage-induced Lgr5(+) cells generate hepatocytes and bile ducts in vivo. Single Lgr5(+) cells from damaged mouse liver can be clonally expanded as organoids in Rspo1-based culture medium over several months. Such clonal organoids can be induced to differentiate in vitro and to generate functional hepatocytes upon transplantation into Fah(-/-) mice. These findings indicate that previous observations concerning Lgr5(+) stem cells in actively self-renewing tissues can also be extended to damage-induced stem cells in a tissue with a low rate of spontaneous proliferation.","[Huch, Meritxell; Boj, Sylvia F.; van Es, Johan H.; Li, Vivian S.

Moreover, the marked tumour regression and improved survival of late-stage BRAF-mutated melanoma patients in response to treatment with vemurafenib demonstrates the essential role of oncogenic BRAF in melanoma maintenance(3,4). However, as most patients relapse with lethal drug-resistant disease, understanding and preventing mechanism(s) of resistance is critical to providing improved therapy(5). Here we investigate the cause and consequences of vemurafenib resistance using two independently derived primary human melanoma xenograft models in which drug resistance is selected by continuous vemurafenib administration. In one of these models, resistant tumours show continued dependency on BRAF(V600E)-> MEK -> ERK signalling owing to elevated BRAF(V600E) expression. Most importantly, we demonstrate that vemurafenib-resistant melanomas become drug dependent for their continued proliferation, such that cessation of drug administration leads to regression of established drug-resistant tumours. We further demonstrate that a discontinuous dosing strategy, which exploits the fitness disadvantage displayed by drug-resistant cells in the absence of the drug, forestalls the onset of lethal drug-resistant disease. These data highlight the concept that drug-resistant cells may also display drug dependency, such that altered dosing may prevent the emergence of lethal drug resistance. Such observations may contribute to sustaining the durability of the vemurafenib response with the ultimate goal of curative therapy for the subset of melanoma patients with BRAF mutations.","[Das Thakur, Meghna; Salangsang, Fernando; Pryer, Nancy K.; Stuart, Darrin D.] Novartis Inst Biomed Res, Emeryville, CA 94608 USA; [Landman, Allison S.; McMahon, Martin] Univ Calif San Francisco, Helen Diller Family Comprehens Canc Ctr, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Landman, Allison S.; McMahon, Martin] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Cellular & Mol Pharmacol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Sellers, William R.] Novartis Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Levesque, Mitchell P.; Dummer, Reinhard] Univ Zurich Hosp, Dept Dermatol, CH-8091 Zurich, Switzerland","Stuart, DD (reprint author), Novartis Inst Biomed Res, Emeryville, CA 94608 USA.",mcmahon@cc.ucsf.edu; darrin.stuart@novartis.com,,,NIBR Presidential Postdoctoral Fellowship; Melanoma Research Alliance; National Cancer Institute [R01-CA176839]; National Research Service Award T32 training grant [HL007185],"We thank the members of the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Reseach (NIBR) Pharmacology department for technical support, comments and discussions during the course of this work.

The inability of insulin to suppress hepatic glucose output is a major aetiological factor in the hyperglycaemia of type-2 diabetes mellitus and other diseases of insulin resistance(1,2). For fifty years, one of the few classes of therapeutics effective in reducing glucose production has been the biguanides, which include phenformim and metformin, the latter the most frequently prescribed drug for type-2 diabetes(3). Nonetheless, the mechanism of action of biguanides remains imperfectly understood. The suggestion a decade ago that metformin reduces glucose synthesis through activation of the enzyme AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has recently been challenged by genetic loss-of-function experiments(4). Here we provide a novel mechanism by which metformin antagonizes the action of glucagon, thus reducing fasting glucose levels. In mouse hepatocytes, metformin leads to the accumulation of AMP and related nucleotides, which inhibit adenylate cyclase, reduce levels of cyclic AMP and protein kinase A (PICA) activity, abrogate phosphorylation of critical protein targets of PICA, and block glucagon-dependent glucose output from hepatocytes. These data support a mechanism of action for metformin involving antagonism of glucagon, and suggest an approach for the development of antidiabetic drugs.","[Miller, Russell A.; Chu, Qingwei; Birnbaum, Morris J.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Inst Diabet Obes & Metab, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Xie, Jianxin] Cell Signaling Technol Inc, Danvers, MA 01923 USA; [Foretz, Marc; Viollet, Benoit] Inst Cochin Genet Mol, INSERM, U1016, F-75014 Paris, France; [Foretz, Marc; Viollet, Benoit] CNRS, UMR8104, F-75014 Paris, France; [Foretz, Marc; Viollet, Benoit] Univ Paris 05, F-75006 Paris, France","Birnbaum, MJ (reprint author), Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Inst Diabet Obes & Metab, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",birnbaum@mail.med.upenn.edu,"FORETZ, Marc/O-7334-2017; Viollet, Benoit/O-6927-2017","FORETZ, Marc/0000-0001-7017-9032; Viollet, Benoit/0000-0002-0121-0224; Birnbaum, Morris/0000-0001-9972-8680","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [RO1 DK56886, PO1 DK49210, F32 DK079572]; Association pour l'Etude des Diabetes et des Maladies Metaboliques (ALFEDIAM); Programme National de Recherche sur le Diabete (PNRD); Institut Benjamin Delessert","This work was supported by National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants RO1 DK56886 and PO1 DK49210 (M.J.B.) and F32 DK079572 (R.A.M.), the Association pour l'Etude des Diabetes et des Maladies Metaboliques (ALFEDIAM) (to M.F.), the Programme National de Recherche sur le Diabete (PNRD) (to M.F. and B.V.) and the Institut Benjamin Delessert (to M.F.).

The transcriptional programs and regulatory factors required for immune cells to switch from homeostatic (often tissue-protective) function(1) to potent antimicrobial immunity are poorly defined. Mucosal retinoic-acidreceptor-related orphan receptor-gamma t-positive (ROR gamma t(+)) innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are emerging as an important innate lymphocyte population required for immunity to intestinal infections(2). Various subsets of ROR gamma t(+) ILCs have been described(3-8) but the transcriptional programs controlling their specification and fate remain largely unknown. Here we provide evidence that the transcription factor T-bet determines the fate of a distinct lineage of CCR6(-)ROR gamma t(+) ILCs. Postnatally emerging CCR6(-)ROR gamma t(+) ILCs upregulated T-bet and this was controlled by cues from the commensal microbiota and interleukin-23 (IL-23). In contrast, CCR6(+)ROR gamma t(+) ILCs, which arise earlier during ontogeny, did not express T-bet. T-bet instructed the expression of T-bet target genes such as interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and of the natural cytotoxicity receptor NKp46. Mice genetically lacking T-bet showed normal development of CCR6(-)ROR gamma t(+) ILCs, but they could not differentiate into NKp46-expressing ROR gamma t(+) ILCs (that is, IL-22-producing natural killer (NK-22) cells)(3,9) and failed to produce IFN-gamma. The production of IFN-gamma by T-bet-expressing CCR6(-)ROR gamma t(+) ILCs was essential for the release of mucus-forming glycoproteins required to protect the epithelial barrier during Salmonella enterica infection(10,11). Salmonella infection also causes severe enterocolitis that is at least partly driven by IFN-gamma(12). Mice deficient for T-bet or depleted of ILCs developed only mild enterocolitis. Thus, graded expression of T-bet in CCR6(-)ROR gamma t(+) MCs facilitates the differentiation of IFN-gamma-producing CCR6(-)ROR gamma t(+) ILCs required to protect the epithelial barrier against Salmonella infections.

Examples of such maps include libraries of the spectroscopic properties of molecules, or databases of drug structures in analytical or forensic chemistry. Such maps, and methods to navigate them, constitute reliable assays to probe any sample for the presence and amount of molecules contained in the map. So far, attempts to generate such maps for any proteome have failed to reach complete proteome coverage(1-3). Here we use a strategy based on high-throughput peptide synthesis and mass spectrometry to generate an almost complete reference map (97% of the genome-predicted proteins) of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteome. We generated two versions of this mass-spectrometric map, one supporting discovery-driven (shotgun)(3,4) and the other supporting hypothesis-driven (targeted)(5,6) proteomic measurements. Together, the two versions of the map constitute a complete set of proteomic assays to support most studies performed with contemporary proteomic technologies. To show the utility of the maps, we applied them to a protein quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis(7), which requires precise measurement of the same set of peptides over a large number of samples. Protein measurements over 78 S. cerevisiae strains revealed a complex relationship between independent genetic loci, influencing the levels of related proteins. Our results suggest that selective pressure favours the acquisition of sets of polymorphisms that adapt protein levels but also maintain the stoichiometry of functionally related pathway members.","[Picotti, Paola; Roest, Hannes; Rinner, Oliver; Reiter, Lukas; Shen, Qin; Frei, Andreas; Wollscheid, Bernd; Aebersold, Ruedi] ETH, Inst Mol Syst Biol, Dept Biol, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Picotti, Paola] ETH, Inst Biochem, Dept Biol, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Clement-Ziza, Mathieu; Michaelson, Jacob J.; Beyer, Andreas] Tech Univ Dresden, Ctr Biotechnol, D-01069 Dresden, Germany; [Lam, Henry] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Lam, Henry] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Div Biomed Engn, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Campbell, David S.; Deutsch, Eric W.; Sun, Zhi; Kusebauch, Ulrike; Moritz, Robert L.] Inst Syst Biol, Seattle, WA 98103 USA; [Schmidt, Alexander] Univ Basel, Prote Core Facil Biozentrum, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; [Rinner, Oliver; Reiter, Lukas] Biognosys AG, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Shen, Qin] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Biol Sci, Inst Nutr Sci, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China; [Alberti, Simon] Max Planck Inst Mol Cell Biol & Genet, D-01307 Dresden, Germany; [Aebersold, Ruedi] Competence Ctr Syst Physiol & Metab Dis, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Aebersold, Ruedi] Univ Zurich, Fac Sci, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland","Aebersold, R (reprint author), ETH, Inst Mol Syst Biol, Dept Biol, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",paola.picotti@bc.biol.ethz.ch; andreas.beyer@biotec.tu-dresden.de; aebersold@imsb.biol.ethz.ch,"Rost, Hannes/E-9564-2013; Beyer, Andreas/A-3352-2009; Clement-Ziza, Mathieu/J-4146-2012; Wollscheid, Bernd/E-8909-2010; Alberti, Simon/B-2822-2017; Lam, Henry/D-8629-2011","Rost, Hannes/0000-0003-0990-7488; Beyer, Andreas/0000-0002-3891-2123; Clement-Ziza, Mathieu/0000-0003-2763-249X; Wollscheid, Bernd/0000-0002-3923-1610; Alberti, Simon/0000-0003-4017-6505; Lam, Henry/0000-0001-7928-0364; Deutsch, Eric/0000-0001-8732-0928","ETH Zurich; Swiss National Science Foundation [3100A0-107679]; National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health [N01-HV-28179]; National Science Foundation MRI [0923536]; Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine; University of Luxembourg; SystemsX.ch; Swiss initiative for systems biology; Foerderungsprofessur grant from the Swiss National Science Foundation [PP00P3_133670]; European Union Seventh Framework Program Reintegration grant [FP7-PEOPLE-2010-RG-277147]; Promedica Stiftung [2-70669-11]; University Grant Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, China [HKUST DAG08/09.EG02]; Klaus Tschira Foundation; European Union FP7 HEALTH grant [HEALTH-F4-2008-223539]; European Research Council [ERC-2008-AdG 233226]; SystemsX.ch, the Swiss Initiative for Systems Biolod","This project has been funded in part by ETH Zurich, the Swiss National Science Foundation (3100A0-107679), the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health (N01-HV-28179), the National Science Foundation MRI (grant 0923536); the Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine and the University of Luxembourg, and by SystemsX.ch, the Swiss initiative for systems biology.

Here we demonstrate that C. albicans has a viable haploid state that can be derived from diploid cells under in vitro and in vivo conditions, and that seems to arise through a concerted chromosome loss mechanism. Haploids undergo morphogenetic changes like those of diploids, including the yeast-hyphal transition, chlamydospore formation and a white-opaque switch that facilitates mating. Haploid opaque cells of opposite mating type mate efficiently to regenerate the diploid form, restoring heterozygosity and fitness. Homozygous diploids arise spontaneously by auto-diploidization, and both haploids and auto-diploids show a similar reduction in fitness, in vitro and in vivo, relative to heterozygous diploids, indicating that homozygous cell types are transient in mixed populations. Finally, we constructed stable haploid strains with multiple auxotrophies that will facilitate molecular and genetic analyses of this important pathogen.","[Hickman, Meleah A.; Abbey, Darren; Harrison, Benjamin D.; Berman, Judith] Univ Minnesota, Dept Genet Cell Biol & Dev, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Zeng, Guisheng; Wang, Yan-Ming; Wang, Yue] Agcy Sci Technol & Res, Inst Mol & Cell Biol, Singapore 138673, Singapore; [Forche, Anja] Bowdoin Coll, Brunswick, ME 04011 USA; [Hirakawa, Matthew P.; Bennett, Richard J.] Brown Univ, Dept Mol Microbiol & Immunol, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Su, Ching-hua] Taipei Med Univ, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Taipei, Taiwan; [Berman, Judith] Tel Aviv Univ, George Wise Fac Life Sci, Dept Mol Microbiol & Biotechnol, IL-69978 Ramat Aviv, Israel","Berman, J (reprint author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Genet Cell Biol & Dev, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",jberman@umn.edu,"Wang, Yue/H-2107-2011; Zeng, Guisheng/D-8052-2013; ASTAR, IMCB/E-2320-2012","Wang, Yue/0000-0002-1211-2822; Bennett, Richard/0000-0001-7563-484X; Berman, Judith/0000-0002-8577-0084","NRSA [F32GM096536-02]; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R15-AI090633-01A1, R01 AI0624273, AI081560, AI081704, AI0624273]; training grant for Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need [P200A100100]; National Institute of Dental & Craniofacial Research [T32DE007288]; Burroughs Wellcome Fund; Agency for Science, Technology, & Research, Singapore","We would like to thank M.

However, it was recently discovered that IFITs can directly recognize viral RNA bearing a 5'-triphosphate group (PPP-RNA), which is a molecular signature that distinguishes it from host RNA. Here we report crystal structures of human IFIT5, its complex with PPP-RNAs, and an amino-terminal fragment of IFIT1. The structures reveal a new helical domain that houses a positively charged cavity designed to specifically engage only single-stranded PPP-RNA, thus, distinguishing it from the canonical cytosolic sensor of double-stranded viral PPP-RNA, retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I, also known as DDX58). Mutational analysis, proteolysis and gel-shift assays reveal that PPP-RNA is bound in a non-sequence-specific manner and requires a 5'-overhang of approximately three nucleotides. Abrogation of PPP-RNA binding in Inn and IFIT5 was found to cause a defect in the antiviral response by human embryonic kidney cells. These results demonstrate the mechanism by which IFIT proteins selectively recognize viral RNA, and lend insight into their downstream effector function.","[Abbas, Yazan M.; Nagar, Bhushan] McGill Univ, Dept Biochem, Montreal, PQ H3G 0B1, Canada; [Abbas, Yazan M.; Nagar, Bhushan] McGill Univ, Grp Rech Axe Struct Prot, Montreal, PQ H3G 0B1, Canada; [Pichmair, Andreas; Gorna, Maria W.; Superti-Furga, Giulio] Austrian Acad Sci, CeMM Res Ctr Mol Med, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Pichmair, Andreas] Max Planck Inst Biochem, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany","Nagar, B (reprint author), McGill Univ, Dept Biochem, Montreal, PQ H3G 0B1, Canada.",gsuperti@cemm.oeaw.ac.at; bhushan.nagar@mcgill.ca,"Gorna, Maria/F-4269-2014; Superti-Furga, Giulio/F-4755-2015","Gorna, Maria/0000-0002-1769-4542; Superti-Furga, Giulio/0000-0002-0570-1768","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; National Research Council Canada; Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) [MOP-82929]; Province of Saskatchewan, Western Economic Diversification Canada; University of Saskatchewan; Canada Research Chair; Career Development Award from the Human Frontiers Science Program [CDA 0018/2006-C/1]; Austrian Academy of Sciences; i-FIVE ERC grant; EMBO [ATLF 463-2008]; CIHR Strategic Training Initiative in Chemical Biology","We thank S.

Establishing a causal connection between these mass-loss episodes and the final explosion would provide a novel way to study pre-supernova massive-star evolution. Here we report. observations of a mass-loss event detected 40 days before the explosion of the type IIn supernova SN 2010mc (also known as PTF 10tel). Our photometric and spectroscopic data suggest that this event is a result of an energetic outburst, radiating at least 6 x 10(47) erg of energy and releasing about 10(-2) solar masses of material at typical velocities of 2,000 km s(-1). The temporal proximity of the mass-loss outburst and the supernova explosion implies a causal connection between them. Moreover, we find that the outburst luminosity and velocity are consistent with the predictions of the wave-driven pulsation model(6), and disfavour alternative suggestions(7).","[Ofek, E.

As reflected in its name, coherent diffractive imaging relies on high coherence when reconstructing highly resolved images from diffraction intensities alone without the need for image-forming lenses(1-3). Fully coherent light can be described adequately by a single pure state. Yet partial coherence and imperfect detection often need to be accounted for, requiring statistical optics or the superposition of states(4,5). Furthermore, the dynamics of samples are increasingly the very objectives of experiments(6). Here we provide a general analytic approach to the characterization of diffractive imaging systems that can be described as low-rank mixed states. We use experimental data and simulations to show how the reconstruction technique compensates for and characterizes various sources of decoherence quantitatively. Based on ptychography(7,8), the procedure is closely related to quantum state tomography and is equally applicable to high-resolution microscopy, wave sensing and fluctuation measurements. As a result, some of the most stringent experimental conditions in ptychography can be relaxed, and susceptibility to imaging artefacts is reduced. Furthermore, the method yields high-resolution images of mixed states within the sample, which may include quantum mixtures or fast stationary stochastic processes such as vibrations, switching or steady flows.","[Thibault, Pierre] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Phys, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Menzel, Andreas] Paul Scherrer Inst, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland","Thibault, P (reprint author), Tech Univ Munich, Dept Phys, D-85748 Garching, Germany.",pierre.thibault@tum.de,"Thibault, Pierre/B-2656-2010; Menzel, Andreas/C-4388-2012","Menzel, Andreas/0000-0002-0489-609X",European Research Council [279753],"We thank M.

They offer zero quiescent power and yet combine novel functions such as programmable logic operation and non-volatile built-in memory(1-5). However, practical efforts to adapt a magnetic device to logic suffer from a low signal-to-noise ratio and other performance attributes that are not adequate for logic gates. Rather than exploiting magnetoresistive effects that result from spin-dependent transport of carriers, we have approached the development of a magnetic logic device in a different way: we use the phenomenon of large magnetoresistance found in non-magnetic semiconductors in high electric fields(6,7). Here we report a device showing a strong diode characteristic that is highly sensitive to both the sign and the magnitude of an external magnetic field, offering a reversible change between two different characteristic states by the application of a magnetic field. This feature results from magnetic control of carrier generation(8) and recombination in an InSb p-n bilayer channel(9). Simple circuits combining such elementary devices are fabricated and tested, and Boolean logic functions including AND, OR, NAND and NOR are performed. They are programmed dynamically by external electric or magnetic signals, demonstrating magnetic-field-controlled semiconductor reconfigurable logic at room temperature. This magnetic technology permits a new kind of spintronic device, characterized as a current switch rather than a voltage switch, and provides a simple and compact platform for non-volatile reconfigurable logic devices.","[Joo, Sungjung; Kim, Taeyueb; Chang, Joonyeon; Han, Suk Hee; Shin, Kyung-Ho] KIST, Spin Convergence Res Ctr, Seoul 130650, South Korea; [Joo, Sungjung; Kim, Taeyueb; Hong, Jinki; Rhie, Kungwon] Korea Univ, Dept Display & Semicond Phys, Sejong 339700, South Korea; [Shin, Sang Hoon; Lim, Ju Young; Song, Jin Dong] KIST, Nano Photon Res Ctr, Seoul 130650, South Korea; [Lee, Hyun-Woo] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Phys, Pohang 790784, South Korea; [Johnson, Mark] USN, Res Lab, Washington, DC 20375 USA","Hong, J (reprint author), Korea Univ, Dept Display & Semicond Phys, Sejong 339700, South Korea.",jkhongjkhong@korea.ac.kr; jdsong@kist.re.kr,"Lee, Hyun-Woo/B-8995-2008","Lee, Hyun-Woo/0000-0002-1648-8093","KIST; NRF; MEST [2010-0000506, 2011-0012386, 2012-0005631, 2012K001280]; industrial strategic technology development programme; MKE [KI002182]; GRL; Office of Naval Research","This work was supported by the KIST vision 21 programme, NRF grants funded by MEST (2010-0000506,2011-0012386 and 2012-0005631), the industrial strategic technology development programme funded by MKE (KI002182), the Dream project, MEST (2012K001280), GRL and the Office of Naval Research.",,21,48,48,9,155,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Feb,2013,494,7435,,,,,72,76,,10.1038/nature11817,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,087DJ,WOS:000314741200036,23364687.0,No,,,11/20/17,mark,johnson,male,1,6176,di91z5wAAAAJ,89898

This challenge has focused some interest on DNA as an attractive target for information storage(1) because of its capacity for high-density information encoding, longevity under easily achieved conditions(2-4) and proven track record as an information bearer. Previous DNA-based information storage approaches have encoded only trivial amounts of information(5-7) or were not amenable to scaling-up(8), and used no robust error-correction and lacked examination of their cost-efficiency for large-scale information archival(9). Here we describe a scalable method that can reliably store more information than has been handled before. We encoded computer files totalling 739 kilobytes of hard-disk storage and with an estimated Shannon information(10) of 5.2 x 10(6) bits into a DNA code, synthesized this DNA, sequenced it and reconstructed the original files with 100% accuracy. Theoretical analysis indicates that our DNA-based storage scheme could be scaled far beyond current global information volumes and offers a realistic technology for large-scale, long-term and infrequently accessed digital archiving. In fact, current trends in technological advances are reducing DNA synthesis costs at a pace that should make our scheme cost-effective for sub-50-year archiving within a decade.","[Goldman, Nick; Bertone, Paul; Dessimoz, Christophe; Sipos, Botond; Birney, Ewan] European Bioinformat Inst, Hinxton CB10 1SD, England; [Chen, Siyuan; LeProust, Emily M.] Genom LSSU, Agilent Technol, Santa Clara, CA 95051 USA","Goldman, N (reprint author), European Bioinformat Inst, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Hinxton CB10 1SD, England.",goldman@ebi.ac.uk,"Chen, Siyuan/C-6163-2012; Bertone, Paul/A-6600-2013","Bertone, Paul/0000-0001-5059-4829; Sipos, Botond/0000-0002-9046-3302; Goldman, Nick/0000-0001-8486-2211; Birney, Ewan/0000-0001-8314-8497; Dessimoz, Christophe/0000-0002-2170-853X",Swiss National Science Foundation [136461]; EMBL,"At the University of Cambridge: D.

Statistical analyses of long climate records supported this theory, but they also posed a substantial challenge by showing that changes in Southern Hemisphere climate were in phase with or led those in the north(2). Although an orbitally forced Northern Hemisphere signal may have been transmitted to the Southern Hemisphere(3), insolation forcing can also directly influence local Southern Hemisphere climate, potentially intensified by sea-ice feedback(4-6), suggesting that the hemispheres may have responded independently to different aspects of orbital forcing. Signal processing of climate records cannot distinguish between these conditions, however, because the proposed insolation forcings share essentially identical variability(7). Here we use transient simulations with a coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model to identify the impacts of forcing from changes in orbits, atmospheric CO2 concentration, ice sheets and the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) on hemispheric temperatures during the first half of the last deglaciation (22-14.3 kyr BP). Although based on a single model, our transient simulation with only orbital changes supports the Milankovitch theory in showing that the last deglaciation was initiated by rising insolation during spring and summer in the mid-latitude to high-latitude Northern Hemisphere and by terrestrial snow-albedo feedback. The simulation with all forcings best reproduces the;timing and magnitude of surface temperature evolution in the Southern Hemisphere in deglacial proxy records(8,9). AMOC changes associated with an orbitally induced retreat of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets(10) is the most plausible explanation for the early Southern Hemisphere deglacial warming and its lead over Northern Hemisphere temperature; the ensuing rise in atmospheric CO2 concentration provided the critical feedback on global deglaciation(9,11).","[He, Feng; Carlson, Anders E.; Liu, Zhengyu; Kutzbach, John E.] Univ Wisconsin, Nelson Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Climat Res, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Shakun, Jeremy D.] Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Clark, Peter U.; Carlson, Anders E.] Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Carlson, Anders E.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Geosci, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Liu, Zhengyu] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Otto-Bliesner, Bette L.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Climate & Global Dynam Div, Boulder, CO 80307 USA","He, F (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Nelson Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Climat Res, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",fenghe@wisc.edu,,,"Office of Science of the Department of Energy [DE-AC05-00OR22725]; US National Science Foundation [AGS-0902802, AGS-1203430]; Climate, People, and the Environment Program; National Science Foundation [06023950-ATM]","We thank O.

Theory predicts that this combination of environmental change and diversity loss increases the risk of abrupt and potentially irreversible ecosystem collapse(1-3,5-7), but long-term empirical evidence from natural systems is lacking. Here we demonstrate this relationship in a degraded but species-rich pyrogenic grassland in which the combined effects of fire suppression, invasion and trophic collapse have created a species-poor grassland that is highly productive, resilient to yearly climatic fluctuations, and resistant to invasion, but vulnerable to rapid collapse after the re-introduction of fire. We initially show how human disturbance has created a negative relationship between diversity and function, contrary to theoretical predictions(3,4). Fire prevention since the mid-nineteenth century is associated with the loss of plant species but it has stabilized high-yield annual production and invasion resistance, comparable to a managed high-yield low-diversity agricultural system. In managing for fire suppression, however, a hidden vulnerability to sudden environmental change emerges that is explained by the elimination of the buffering effects of high species diversity. With the re-introduction of fire, grasslands only persist in areas with remnant concentrations of native species, in which a range of rare and mostly functionally redundant plants proliferate after burning and prevent extensive invasion including a rapid conversion towards woodland. This research shows how biodiversity can be crucial for ecosystem stability despite appearing functionally insignificant beforehand, a relationship probably applicable to many ecosystems given the globally prevalent combination of intensive long-term land management and species loss.","[MacDougall, A.

However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the regulation of innate immunity in the central nervous system remain elusive. Here we show that the astrocytic dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) modulates innate immunity through alpha B-crystallin (CRYAB), which is known to suppress neuroinflammation(1,2). We demonstrate that knockout mice lacking Drd2 showed remarkable inflammatory response in multiple central nervous system regions and increased the vulnerability of nigral dopaminergic neurons to neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced neurotoxicity(3). Astrocytes null for Drd2 became hyper-responsive to immune stimuli with a marked reduction in the level of CRYAB. Preferential ablation of Drd2 in astrocytes robustly activated astrocytes in the substantia nigra. Gain- or loss-of-function studies showed that CRYAB is critical for DRD2-mediated modulation of innate immune response in astrocytes. Furthermore, treatment of wildtype mice with the selective DRD2 agonist quinpirole increased resistance of the nigral dopaminergic neurons to MPTP through partial suppression of inflammation. Our study indicates that astrocytic DRD2 activation normally suppresses neuroinflammation in the central nervous system through a CRYAB-dependent mechanism, and provides a new strategy for targeting the astrocyte-mediated innate immune response in the central nervous system during ageing and disease.","[Shao, Wei; Zhang, Shu-zhen; Tang, Mi; Zhang, Xin-hua; Zhou, Zheng; Yin, Yan-qing; Zhou, Qin-bo; Huang, Yuan-yuan; Liu, Ying-jun; Zhou, Jia-wei] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Biol Sci, Inst Neurosci, State Key Lab Neurosci, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China; [Tang, Mi; Hu, Gang] Nanjing Med Univ, Dept Pharmacol, Jiangsu Key Lab Neurodegenerat, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wawrousek, Eric] NEI, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Chen, Teng; Li, Sheng-bin] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Med, Dept Forens Sci, Xian 710061, Shanxi, Peoples R China; [Xu, Ming] Univ Chicago, Dept Anesthesia & Crit Care, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Zhou, Jiang-ning] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Life Sci, CAS Key Lab Brain Funct & Dis, Hefei 230027, Anhui, Peoples R China","Zhou, JW (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Biol Sci, Inst Neurosci, State Key Lab Neurosci, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China.",jwzhou@ion.ac.cn,"Wawrousek, Eric/A-4547-2008","Zhou, Qinbo/0000-0002-7967-2138; Liu, Yingjun/0000-0003-1543-1965","Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Basic Research Program of China [2011CBA00408, 2011CB504102]; Natural Science Foundation of China [31021063, 31123002]; Shanghai Metropolitan Fund for Research and Development","We thank B.

Human TMC1 and TMC2 genes are linked to human deafness and required for hair-cell mechanotransduction; however, the molecular functions of these and other TMC proteins have not been determined(3-6). Here we show that the Caenorhabditis elegans tmc-1 gene encodes a sodium sensor that functions specifically in salt taste chemosensation. tmc-1 is expressed in the ASH polymodal avoidance neurons, where it is required for salt-evoked neuronal activity and behavioural avoidance of high concentrations of NaCl. However, tmc-1 has no effect on responses to other stimuli sensed by the ASH neurons including high osmolarity and chemical repellents, indicating a specific role in salt sensation. When expressed in mammalian cell culture, C. elegans TMC-1 generates a predominantly cationic conductance activated by high extracellular sodium but not by other cations or uncharged small molecules. Thus, TMC-1 is both necessary for salt sensation in vivo and sufficient to generate a sodium-sensitive channel in vitro, identifying it as a probable ionotropic sensory receptor.","[Chatzigeorgiou, Marios; Schafer, William R.] MRC Lab Mol Biol, Div Cell Biol, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England; [Bang, Sangsu; Hwang, Sun Wook] Korea Univ, Coll Med, Dept Biomed Sci, Seoul 136705, South Korea","Hwang, SW (reprint author), Korea Univ, Coll Med, Dept Biomed Sci, Seoul 136705, South Korea.",sunhwang@korea.ac.kr; wschafer@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk,,"Schafer, William/0000-0002-6676-8034; bang, sangsu/0000-0002-9092-0075; Hwang, Sun Wook/0000-0001-8460-7480",Medical Research Council; National Research Foundation of Korea [2012000540]; Ministry of Health Welfare [A111373],"We thank the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center and M. de Bono for strains, and A.

However, partial reprogramming and genetic instabilities in iPSCs(3-6) could elicit immune responses in transplant recipients even when iPSC-derived differentiated cells are transplanted. iPSCs are first differentiated into specific types of cells in vitro for subsequent transplantation. Although model transplantation experiments have been conducted using various iPSC-derived differentiated tissues(7-10) and immune rejections have not been observed, careful investigation of the immunogenicity of iPSC-derived tissue is becoming increasingly critical, especially as this has not been the focus of most studies done so far. A recent study reported immunogenicity of iPSC- but not ES-cell-derived teratomas(11) and implicated several causative genes. Nevertheless, some controversy has arisen regarding these findings(12). Here we examine the immunogenicity of differentiated skin and bone marrow tissues derived from mouse iPSCs. To ensure optimal comparison of iPSCs and ES cells, we established ten integration-free iPSC and seven ES-cell lines using an inbred mouse strain, C57BL/6. We observed no differences in the rate of success of transplantation when skin and bone marrow cells derived from iPSCs were compared with ES-cell-derived tissues. Moreover, we observed limited or no immune responses, including T-cell infiltration, for tissues derived from either iPSCs or ES cells, and no increase in the expression of the immunogenicity-causing Zg16 and Hormad1 genes in regressing skin and teratoma tissues. Our findings suggest limited immunogenicity of transplanted cells differentiated from iPSCs and ES cells.","[Araki, Ryoko; Uda, Masahiro; Hoki, Yuko; Sunayama, Misato; Nakamura, Miki; Ando, Shunsuke; Sugiura, Mayumi; Ideno, Hisashi; Nifuji, Akira; Abe, Masumi] Natl Inst Radiol Sci, Transcriptome Res Grp, Chiba 2638555, Japan; [Araki, Ryoko] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy JST, PRESTO, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; [Ideno, Hisashi; Shimada, Akemi; Nifuji, Akira] Tsurumi Univ, Sch Dent Med, Dept Pharmacol, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2308501, Japan","Abe, M (reprint author), Natl Inst Radiol Sci, Transcriptome Res Grp, Chiba 2638555, Japan.",abemasum@nirs.go.jp,,,"Precursory Research for Embryonic Science and Technology (PRESTO), Japan Science and Technology Agency","We thank S.

However, using iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) to model an adult-onset heart disease remains challenging owing to the uncertainty regarding the ability of relatively immature iPSC-CMs to fully recapitulate adult disease phenotypes. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (ARVD/C) is an inherited heart disease characterized by pathological fatty infiltration and cardiomyocyte loss predominantly in the right ventricles(8), which is associated with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Over 50% of affected individuals have desmosome gene mutations, most commonly in PKP2, encoding plakophilin-2 (ref. 9). The median age at presentation of ARVD/C is 26 years(8). We used previously published methods(1,10) to generate iPSC lines from fibroblasts of two patients with ARVD/C and PKP2 mutations(11,12). Mutant PKP2 iPSC-CMs demonstrate abnormal plakoglobin nuclear translocation and decreased beta-catenin activity(13) in cardiogenic conditions; yet, these abnormal features are insufficient to reproduce the pathological phenotypes of ARVD/C in standard cardiogenic conditions. Here we show that induction of adult-like metabolic energetics from an embryonic/glycolytic state and abnormal peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) activation underlie the pathogenesis of ARVD/C. By co-activating normal PPAR-alpha-dependent metabolism and abnormal PPAR-gamma pathway in beating embryoid bodies (EBs) with defined media, we established an efficient ARVD/C in vitro model within 2 months. This model manifests exaggerated lipogenesis and apoptosis in mutant PKP2 iPSC-CMs. iPSC-CMs with a homozygous PKP2 mutation also had calcium-handling deficits. Our study is the first to demonstrate that induction of adult-like metabolism has a critical role in establishing an adult-onset disease model using patient-specific iPSCs. Using this model, we revealed crucial pathogenic insights that metabolic derangement in adult-like metabolic milieu underlies ARVD/C pathologies, enabling us to propose novel disease-modifying therapeutic strategies.","[Kim, Changsung; Wong, Johnson; Wen, Jianyan; Wang, Shirong; Wang, Cheng; Chen, Huei-Sheng Vincent] Sanford Burnham Med Res Inst, Del E Webb Neurosci Aging & Stem Cell Res Ctr, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Wen, Jianyan] China Japan Friendship Hosp, Dept Cardiovasc Surg, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Spiering, Sean; Kan, Natalia G.; Forcales, Sonia; Puri, Pier Lorenzo] Sanford Burnham Med Res Inst, Muscle Regenerat & Dev Program, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Puri, Pier Lorenzo] IRCCS Fdn Santa Lucia, Dulbecco Telethon Inst, I-00179 Rome, Italy; [Leone, Teresa C.; Kelly, Daniel P.] Sanford Burnham Med Res Inst, Diabet & Obes Res Ctr, Orlando, FL 32827 USA; [Marine, Joseph E.; Calkins, Hugh; Judge, Daniel P.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med Cardiol, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA; [Chen, Huei-Sheng Vincent] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Med Cardiol, San Diego, CA 92103 USA","Chen, HSV (reprint author), Sanford Burnham Med Res Inst, Del E Webb Neurosci Aging & Stem Cell Res Ctr, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",hsv_chen@burnham.org,,"Forcales, Sonia/0000-0002-7111-4959","Scripps Research Institute; NIH [RO1 HL058493, RO1 HL101189, RO1 AR056712, RO1 AR052779, RO1 HL105194]; California Institute of Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) [RS1-00171-1, RB2-01512, RB4-06276]; Fondazione Telethon","We thank the patients for their participation, microarray core facilities at SBMRI and Scripps Research Institute for their support T.

MicroRNA (miRNA)-dependent post-transcriptional gene silencing has been recognized recently to control gene expression in disease development and progression, including that of insulin-resistant type 2 diabetes. The deregulation of miRNAs miR-143 (ref. 4), miR-181 (ref. 5), and miR-103 and miR-107 (ref. 6) alters hepatic insulin sensitivity. Here we report that the expression of miR-802 is increased in the liver of two obese mouse models and obese human subjects. Inducible transgenic overexpression of miR-802 in mice causes impaired glucose tolerance and attenuates insulin sensitivity, whereas reduction of miR-802 expression improves glucose tolerance and insulin action. We identify Hnf1b (also known as Tcf2) as a target of miR-802-dependent silencing, and show that short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated reduction of Hnf1b in liver causes glucose intolerance, impairs insulin signalling and promotes hepatic gluconeogenesis. In turn, hepatic overexpression of Hnf1b improves insulin sensitivity in Lepr(db/db) mice. Thus, this study defines a critical role for deregulated expression of miR-802 in the development of obesity-associated impairment of glucose metabolism through targeting of Hnf1b, and assigns Hnf1b an unexpected role in the control of hepatic insulin sensitivity.","[Kornfeld, Jan-Wilhelm; Baitzel, Catherina; Koenner, A.

Breakdown of this regulation and the resulting inappropriate immune response to commensals are thought to lead to the development of inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis(7). We proposed that the intestinal immune system is instructed by the microbiota to limit responses to luminal antigens. Here we demonstrate in mice that, at steady state, the microbiota inhibits the transport of both commensal and pathogenic bacteria from the lumen to a key immune inductive site, the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs). However, in the absence of Myd88 or under conditions of antibiotic-induced dysbiosis, non-invasive bacteria were trafficked to the MLNs in a CCR7-dependent manner, and induced both T-cell responses and IgA production. Trafficking was carried out by CX(3)CR1(hi) mononuclear phagocytes, an intestinal-cell population previously reported to be non-migratory(8). These findings define a central role for commensals in regulating the migration to the MLNs of CX(3)CR1(hi) mononuclear phagocytes endowed with the ability to capture luminal bacteria, thereby compartmentalizing the intestinal immune response to avoid inflammation.","[Diehl, Gretchen E.; Longman, Randy S.; Zhang, Jing-Xin; Breart, Beatrice; Galan, Carolina; Cuesta, Adolfo; Schwab, Susan R.; Littman, Dan R.] NYU, Sch Med, Kimmel Ctr Biol & Med, Mol Pathogenesis Program,Skirball Inst, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Longman, Randy S.] Columbia Univ, Dept Med, Div Digest & Liver Dis, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Cuesta, Adolfo; Littman, Dan R.] NYU, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10016 USA","Diehl, GE (reprint author), NYU, Sch Med, Kimmel Ctr Biol & Med, Mol Pathogenesis Program,Skirball Inst, New York, NY 10016 USA.",Gretchen.Diehl@med.nyu.edu,"Breart, Beatrice/M-7123-2014","Schwab, Susan/0000-0002-0834-0822","National Cancer Institute [5P30CA016087-32]; American Cancer Society; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [T32 CA009161, T32 DK083256-02, R01AI085166]; Human Frontier Science Program Long-Term Fellowship; Howard Hughes Medical Institute","We thank H.

Halofuginone (HF), the halogenated derivative of febrifugine, has been tested in clinical trials for potential therapeutic applications in cancer and fibrotic disease(3-6). Recently, HF was reported to inhibit T(H)17 cell differentiation by activating the amino acid response pathway(7), through inhibiting human prolyl-transfer RNA synthetase (ProRS) to cause intracellular accumulation of uncharged tRNA(8,9). Curiously, inhibition requires the presence of unhydrolysed ATP. Here we report an unusual 2.0 angstrom structure showing that ATP directly locks onto and orients two parts of HF onto human ProRS, so that one part of HF mimics bound proline and the other mimics the 3' end of bound tRNA. Thus, HF is a new type of ATP-dependent inhibitor that simultaneously occupies two different substrate binding sites on ProRS. Moreover, our structure indicates a possible similar mechanism of action for febrifugine in malaria treatment. Finally, the elucidation here of a two-site modular targeting activity of HF raises the possibility that substrate-directed capture of similar inhibitors might be a general mechanism that could be applied to other synthetases.","[Zhou, Huihao; Sun, Litao; Yang, Xiang-Lei; Schimmel, Paul] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol Biol, Skaggs Inst Chem Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Schimmel, P (reprint author), Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol Biol, Skaggs Inst Chem Biol, 10550 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",schimmel@scripps.edu,"ZHOU, HUIHAO/L-6133-2016",,"National Institutes of Health [GM15539, GM23562, GM88278]; National Foundation for Cancer Research","We thank K.

Mitotic entry is known to interfere with tissue morphogenetic events that require cell-shape changes controlled by the interphase cytoskeleton, such as apical constriction(3-5). However, here we show that mitosis plays an active role in the epithelial invagination of the Drosophila melanogaster tracheal placode. Invagination begins with a slow phase under the control of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling; in this process, the central apically constricted cells, which are surrounded by intercalating cells(6,7), form a shallow pit. This slow phase is followed by a fast phase, in which the pit is rapidly depressed, accompanied by mitotic entry, which leads to the internalization of all the cells in the placode. We found that mitotic cell rounding, but not cell division, of the central cells in the placode is required to accelerate invagination, in conjunction with EGFR-induced myosin II contractility in the surrounding cells. We propose that mitotic cell rounding causes the epithelium to buckle under pressure and acts as a switch for morphogenetic transition at the appropriate time.","[Kondo, Takefumi; Hayashi, Shigeo] RIKEN Ctr Dev Biol, Lab Morphogenet Signaling, Chuo Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan; [Hayashi, Shigeo] Kobe Univ, Dept Biol, Grad Sch Sci, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan","Hayashi, S (reprint author), RIKEN Ctr Dev Biol, Lab Morphogenet Signaling, Chuo Ku, 2-2-3 Minatojima Minamimachi, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan.",shayashi@cdb.riken.jp,"Hayashi, Shigeo/N-5128-2015","Hayashi, Shigeo/0000-0001-7785-1290","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan [22111007, 23770624]; RIKEN Special Postdoctoral Researcher Program","We thank the Kyoto and Bloomington Drosophila Stock Centers, the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, E.

Magnetism is a consequence of broken time-reversal symmetry, whereas superfluidity results from broken gauge invariance. The broken symmetry that develops below 17.5 kelvin in the heavy-fermion compound URu2Si2 has long eluded such identification. Here we show that the recent observation of Ising quasiparticles in URu2Si2 results from a spinor order parameter that breaks double time-reversal symmetry, mixing states of integer and half-integer spin. Such 'hastatic' order hybridizes uranium-atom conduction electrons with Ising 5f(2) states to produce Ising quasiparticles; it accounts for the large entropy of condensation and the magnetic anomaly observed in torque magnetometry. Hastatic order predicts a tiny transverse moment in the conduction-electron 'sea', a colossal Ising anisotropy in the nonlinear susceptibility anomaly and a resonant, energy-dependent nematicity in the tunnelling density of states.","[Chandra, Premala; Coleman, Piers] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Ctr Mat Theory, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; [Coleman, Piers] Univ London, Dept Phys, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England; [Flint, Rebecca] MIT, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Coleman, P (reprint author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Ctr Mat Theory, 136 Frelinghuysen Rd, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.",coleman@physics.rutgers.edu,"Flint, Rebecca/J-3628-2014",,"Simons Foundation; US National Science Foundation [DMR 0907179, 1066293]; US National Science Foundation I2CAM International Materials Institute [DMR-0844115]","An early version of this work was begun in collaboration with P.

Here we explore the use of nuclear genome transfer between unfertilized oocytes of two donors to prevent the transmission of mitochondrial mutations. Nuclear genome transfer did not reduce developmental efficiency to the blastocyst stage, and genome integrity was maintained provided that spontaneous oocyte activation was avoided through the transfer of incompletely assembled spindle-chromosome complexes. Mitochondrial DNA transferred with the nuclear genome was initially detected at levels below 1%, decreasing in blastocysts and stem-cell lines to undetectable levels, and remained undetectable after passaging for more than one year, clonal expansion, differentiation into neurons, cardiomyocytes or beta-cells, and after cellular reprogramming. Stem cells and differentiated cells had mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme activities and oxygen consumption rates indistinguishable from controls.

(One astronomical unit is the EarthSun distance.) The main constituent of the disk, gaseous molecular hydrogen, does not efficiently emit radiation from the disk mass reservoir(5), and so the most common measure of the disk mass is dust thermal emission and lines of gaseous carbon monoxide(6). Carbon monoxide emission generally indicates properties of the disk surface, and the conversion from dust emission to gas mass requires knowledge of the grain properties and the gas-to-dust mass ratio, which probably differ from their interstellar values(7,8). As a result, mass estimates vary by orders of magnitude, as exemplified by the relatively old (3-10 million years) star TW Hydrae(9,10), for which the range is 0.0005-0.06 solar masses(11-14). Here we report the detection of the fundamental rotational transition of hydrogen deuteride from the direction of TW Hydrae. Hydrogen deuteride is a good tracer of disk gas because it follows the distribution of molecular hydrogen and its emission is sensitive to the total mass. The detection of hydrogen deuteride, combined with existing observations and detailed models, implies a disk mass of more than 0.05 solar masses, which is enough to form a planetary system like our own.","[Bergin, Edwin A.; Cleeves, L.

This could allow a many-fold increase in performance. A suggested solution is the shift register(1,2)-a digital building block that passes data from cell to cell along a chain. In conventional digital microelectronics, two-dimensional shift registers are routinely constructed from a number of connected transistors. However, for three-dimensional devices the added process complexity and space needed for such transistors would largely cancel out the benefits of moving into the third dimension. 'Physical' shift registers, in which an intrinsic physical phenomenon is used to move data near-atomic distances, without requiring conventional transistors, are therefore much preferred. Here we demonstrate a way of implementing a spintronic unidirectional vertical shift register between perpendicularly magnetized ferromagnets of subnanometre thickness, similar to the layers used in non-volatile magnetic random-access memory(3). By carefully controlling the thickness of each magnetic layer and the exchange coupling between the layers, we form a ratchet that allows information in the form of a sharp magnetic kink soliton to be unidirectionally pumped (or 'shifted') from one magnetic layer to another. This simple and efficient shift-register concept suggests a route to the creation of three-dimensional microchips for memory and logic applications.","[Lavrijsen, Reinoud; Lee, Ji-Hyun; Fernandez-Pacheco, Amalio; Petit, Dorothee C.

The intra- and extracellular mechanics of such systems are governed by a series of proteins, such as microtubules, actin, intermediate filaments and collagen(3,4). As a general design motif, these proteins self-assemble into helical structures and superstructures that differ in diameter and persistence length to cover the full mechanical spectrum(1). Gels of cytoskeletal proteins display particular mechanical responses (stress stiffening) that until now have been absent in synthetic polymeric and low-molar-mass gels. Here we present synthetic gels that mimic in nearly all aspects gels prepared from intermediate filaments. They are prepared from polyisocyanopeptides(5-7) grafted with oligo(ethylene glycol) side chains. These responsive polymers possess a stiff and helical architecture, and show a tunable thermal transition where the chains bundle together to generate transparent gels at extremely low concentrations. Using characterization techniques operating at different length scales (for example, macroscopic rheology, atomic force microscopy and molecular force spectroscopy) combined with an appropriate theoretical network model(8-10), we establish the hierarchical relationship between the bulk mechanical properties and the single-molecule parameters. Our results show that to develop artificial cytoskeletal or extracellular matrix mimics, the essential design parameters are not only the molecular stiffness, but also the extent of bundling. In contrast to the peptidic materials, our polyisocyanide polymers are readily modified, giving a starting point for functional biomimetic hydrogels with potentially a wide variety of applications(11-14), in particular in the biomedical field.","[Kouwer, Paul H.

The absolute magnitude and regional details of such changes, however, remain intensely debated(2,3). As is well known from El Nino studies, sea-surface-temperature gradients across the tropical Pacific Ocean can strongly influence global rainfall(4,5). Palaeoproxy evidence indicates that the difference between the warm west Pacific and the colder east Pacific increased in past periods when the Earth warmed as a result of increased solar radiation(6-9). In contrast, in most model projections of future greenhouse warming this gradient weakens(2,10,11). It has not been clear how to reconcile these two findings. Here we show in climate model simulations that the tropical Pacific sea-surface-temperature gradient increases when the warming is due to increased solar radiation and decreases when it is due to increased greenhouse-gas forcing. For the same global surface temperature increase the latter pattern produces less rainfall, notably over tropical land, which explains why in the model the late twentieth century is warmer than in the Medieval Warm Period (around AD 1000-1250) but precipitation is less. This difference is consistent with the global tropospheric energy budget(12), which requires a balance between the latent heat released in precipitation and radiative cooling. The tropospheric cooling is less for increased greenhouse gases, which add radiative absorbers to the troposphere, than for increased solar heating, which is concentrated at the Earth's surface. Thus warming due to increased greenhouse gases produces a climate signature different from that of warming due to solar radiation changes.","[Liu, Jian] Nanjing Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Virtual Geog Environm, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jian] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, State Key Lab Lake Sci & Environm, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bin; Yim, So-Young; Lee, June-Yi] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Int Pacific Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96825 USA; [Wang, Bin; Yim, So-Young; Lee, June-Yi] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Meteorol, Honolulu, HI 96825 USA; [Cane, Mark A.] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA","Cane, MA (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA.",jliu@njnu.edu.cn; mcane@ldeo.columbia.edu,"Lee, June-Yi/D-5752-2012","Lee, June-Yi/0000-0002-3986-9753","National Basic Research Program [2010CB950102, XDA05080800]; Natural Science Foundation of China [40871007]; Korean Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MEST) [2011-0021927]; Department of Energy and NOAA [DE-SC0005108, NA08OAR4320912]; International Pacific Research Center; JAMSTEC; NOAA; NASA","This work was supported by the National Basic Research Program (award numbers 2010CB950102 and XDA05080800 to J.L.) and Natural Science Foundation of China (award number 40871007 to J.L. and B.

Approximately 65 per cent of this carbon store is in Indonesia, where extensive anthropogenic degradation in the form of deforestation, drainage and fire are converting it into a globally significant source of atmospheric carbon dioxide(1-3). Here we quantify the annual export of fluvial organic carbon from both intact peat swamp forest and peat swamp forest subject to past anthropogenic disturbance. We find that the total fluvial organic carbon flux from disturbed peat swamp forest is about 50 per cent larger than that from intact peat swamp forest. By carbon-14 dating of dissolved organic carbon (which makes up over 91 per cent of total organic carbon), we find that leaching of dissolved organic carbon from intact peat swamp forest is derived mainly from recent primary production (plant growth). In contrast, dissolved organic carbon from disturbed peat swamp forest consists mostly of much older (centuries to millennia) carbon from deep within the peat column. When we include the fluvial carbon loss term, which is often ignored, in the peatland carbon budget, we find that it increases the estimate of total carbon lost from the disturbed peatlands in our study by 22 per cent. We further estimate that since 1990 peatland disturbance has resulted in a 32 per cent increase in fluvial organic carbon flux from southeast Asia-an increase that is more than half of the entire annual fluvial organic carbon flux from all European peatlands. Our findings emphasize the need to quantify fluvial carbon losses in order to improve estimates of the impact of deforestation and drainage on tropical peatland carbon balances.","[Moore, Sam; Gauci, Vincent] Open Univ, Dept Environm Earth & Ecosyst, CEPSAR, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England; [Evans, Chris D.] Environm Ctr Wales, Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales; [Page, Susan E.] Univ Leicester, Dept Geog, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; [Garnett, Mark H.] Nat Environm Res Council Radiocarbon Facil, E Kilbride G75 0QF, Lanark, Scotland; [Jones, Tim G.; Freeman, Chris] Bangor Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales; [Hooijer, Aljosja] Deltares, NL-2600 MH Delft, Netherlands; [Wiltshire, Andrew J.] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England; [Limin, Suwido H.] Univ Palangka Raya, CIMTROP, Palangka Raya 73112, Central Kaliman, Indonesia","Gauci, V (reprint author), Open Univ, Dept Environm Earth & Ecosyst, CEPSAR, Walton Hall, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England.",v.gauci@open.ac.uk,"Evans, Christopher/F-2087-2010; Garnett, Mark/C-2377-2009; Wiltshire, Andy/C-2848-2008","Evans, Christopher/0000-0002-7052-354X; Garnett, Mark/0000-0001-6486-2126; ","NERC [NE/F008813/1]; Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); Open University (CEPSAR) via the NERC Radiocarbon Facility (Environment) [1323.1008, 15.91]; DECC/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Programme [GA01101]; Royal Society; British Council","S.M. was supported by a NERC PhD studentship (NE/F008813/1).

In the fire ant Solenopsis invicta, the existence of two divergent forms of social organization is under the control of a single Mendelian genomic element marked by two variants of an odorant-binding protein gene(4-8). Here we characterize the genomic region responsible for this important social polymorphism, and show that it is part of a pair of heteromorphic chromosomes that have many of the key properties of sex chromosomes. The two variants, hereafter referred to as the social B and social b (SB and Sb) chromosomes, are characterized by a large region of approximately 13 megabases (55% of the chromosome) in which recombination is completely suppressed between SB and Sb. Recombination seems to occur normally between the SB chromosomes but not between Sb chromosomes because Sb/Sb individuals are non-viable. Genomic comparisons revealed limited differentiation between SB and Sb, and the vast majority of the 616 genes identified in the non-recombining region are present in the two variants. The lack of recombination over more than half of the two heteromorphic social chromosomes can be explained by at least one large inversion of around 9 megabases, and this absence of recombination has led to the accumulation of deleterious mutations, including repetitive elements in the non-recombining region of Sb compared with the homologous region of SB. Importantly, most of the genes with demonstrated expression differences between individuals of the two social forms reside in the non-recombining region. These findings highlight how genomic rearrangements can maintain divergent adaptive social phenotypes involving many genes acting together by locally limiting recombination.","[Wang, John; Wurm, Yannick; Nipitwattanaphon, Mingkwan; Riba-Grognuz, Oksana; Keller, Laurent] Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Wang, John; Huang, Yu-Ching] Acad Sinica, Biodivers Res Ctr, Taipei 115, Taiwan; [Wurm, Yannick] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, London E1 4NS, England; [Wurm, Yannick; Riba-Grognuz, Oksana] Swiss Inst Bioinformat, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Shoemaker, DeWayne] USDA ARS, Ctr Med Agr & Vet Entomol, Gainesville, FL 32608 USA","Wang, J (reprint author), Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",johnwang@gate.sinica.edu.tw; y.wurm@qmul.ac.uk; laurent.keller@unil.ch,"Wurm, Yannick/A-9525-2009","Wurm, Yannick/0000-0002-3140-2809; keller, laurent/0000-0002-5046-9953; Riba-Grognuz, Oksana/0000-0002-2961-2655","Biodiversity Research Center (Academia Sinica, Taiwan), Taiwan NSC [100-2311-B-001-015-MY3]; NERC; BBSRC [BB/K004204/1]; USDA; Swiss NSF; ERC","We thank C.

Despite numerous physiological studies (reviewed in ref. 2), molecularly defined sensory neurons that detect pleasant stroking of hairy skin(3,4) in vivo have not been reported. Previously, we identified a rare population of unmyelinated sensory neurons in mice that express the G-protein-coupled receptor MRGPRB4 (refs 5, 6). These neurons exclusively innervate hairy skin with large terminal arborizations(7) that resemble the receptive fields of C-tactile (CT) afferents in humans(8). Unlike other molecularly defined mechanosensory C-fibre subtypes(9,10), MRGPRB(+) neurons could not be detectably activated by sensory stimulation of the skin ex vivo. Therefore, we developed a preparation for calcium imaging in the spinal projections of these neurons during stimulation of the periphery in intact mice. Here we show that MRGPRB41 neurons are activated by massage-like stroking of hairy skin, but not by noxious punctate mechanical stimulation. By contrast, a different population of C fibres expressing MRGPRD(11) was activated by pinching but not by stroking, consistent with previous physiological and behavioural data(10,12). Pharmacogenetic activation of Mrgprb4-expressing neurons in freely behaving mice promoted conditioned place preference(13), indicating that such activation is positively reinforcing and/or anxiolytic. These data open the way to understanding the function of MRGPRB4 neurons during natural behaviours, and provide a general approach to the functional chargenetically identified subsets of somatosensory neurons in vivo.","[Vrontou, Sophia; Wong, Allan M.; Anderson, David J.] CALTECH, Div Biol 156 29, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Wong, Allan M.; Anderson, David J.] CALTECH, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Rau, Kristofer K.] Univ Louisville, Dept Anat Sci & Neurobiol, Louisville, KY 40202 USA; [Koerber, H.

Deposition of amyloid-beta peptide drives cerebral neuroinflammation by activating microglia(1,2). Indeed, amyloid-beta activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in microglia is fundamental for interleukin-1 beta maturation and subsequent inflammatory events(3). However, it remains unknown whether NLRP3 activation contributes to Alzheimer's disease in vivo. Here we demonstrate strongly enhanced active caspase-1 expression in human mild cognitive impairment and brains with Alzheimer's disease, suggesting a role for the inflammasome in this neurodegenerative disease. Nlrp3(-/-) or Casp1(-/-) mice carrying mutations associated with familial Alzheimer's disease were largely protected from loss of spatial memory and other sequelae associated with Alzheimer's disease, and demonstrated reduced brain caspase-1 and interleukin-1 beta activation as well as enhanced amyloid-beta clearance. Furthermore, NLRP3 inflammasome deficiency skewed microglial cells to an M2 phenotype and resulted in the decreased deposition of amyloid-beta in the APP/PS1 model of Alzheimer's disease. These results show an important role for the NLRP3/caspase-1 axis in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, and suggest that NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition represents a new therapeutic intervention for the disease.","[Heneka, Michael T.; Kummer, Markus P.; Schwartz, Stephanie; Vieira-Saecker, Ana; Griep, Angelika; Axt, Daisy] Univ Bonn, Dept Neurol, Clin Neurosci Unit, D-53127 Bonn, Germany; [Heneka, Michael T.; Latz, Eicke] DZNE, D-53175 Bonn, Germany; [Stutz, Andrea; Latz, Eicke] Univ Bonn, Inst Innate Immun, D-53127 Bonn, Germany; [Delekate, Andrea; Remus, Anita; Korte, Martin] Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Inst Zool, Div Cellular Neurobiol, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany; [Tzeng, Te-Chen; Latz, Eicke; Golenbock, Douglas T.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Med, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Tzeng, Te-Chen; Latz, Eicke; Golenbock, Douglas T.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Div Infect Dis & Immunol, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Gelpi, Ellen] Univ Barcelona, Hosp Clin, IDIBAPS, Neurol Tissue Bank, E-08036 Barcelona, Spain; [Halle, Annett] Ctr Adv European Studies & Res CAESAR, D-53175 Bonn, Germany; [Korte, Martin] AG NIND, HZI, Helmholtz Ctr Infect Res, D-38124 Braunschweig, Germany","Latz, E (reprint author), DZNE, D-53175 Bonn, Germany.",michael.Heneka@ukb.uni-bonn.de; eicke.latz@uni-bonn.de; douglas.golenbock@umassmed.edu,"Latz, Eicke/H-3951-2014","Latz, Eicke/0000-0003-1488-5666; Kummer, Markus/0000-0002-0993-2918",Dana Foundation; National Institutes of Health; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft,"This work was funded by the Dana Foundation (E.

Cell-based studies showed that mTORC1 senses amino acids through the RagA-D family of GTPases(2,3) (also known as RRAGA, B, C and D), but their importance in mammalian physiology is unknown. Here we generate knock-in mice that express a constitutively active form of RagA (RagA(GTP)) from its endogenous promoter. RagA(GTP/GTP) mice develop normally, but fail to survive postnatal day 1. When delivered by Caesarean section, fasted RagA(GTP/GTP) neonates die almost twice as rapidly as wild-type littermates. Within an hour of birth, wild-type neonates strongly inhibit mTORC1, which coincides with profound hypoglycaemia and a decrease in plasma amino-acid concentrations. In contrast, mTORC1 inhibition does not occur in RagA(GTP/GTP) neonates, despite identical reductions in blood nutrient amounts. With prolonged fasting, wild-type neonates recover their plasma glucose concentrations, but RagA(GTP/GTP) mice remain hypoglycaemic until death, despite using glycogen at a faster rate. The glucose homeostasis defect correlates with the inability of fasted RagA(GTP/GTP) neonates to trigger autophagy and produce amino acids for de novo glucose production. Because profound hypoglycaemia does not inhibit mTORC1 inRagA(GTP/GTP) neonates, we considered the possibility that the Rag pathway signals glucose as well as amino-acid sufficiency to mTORC1. Indeed, mTORC1 is resistant to glucose deprivation in RagA(GTP/GTP) fibroblasts, and glucose, like amino acids, controls its recruitment to the lysosomal surface, the site of mTORC1 activation. Thus, the Rag GTPases signal glucose and amino-acid concentrations to mTORC1, and have an unexpectedly key role in neonates in autophagy induction and thus nutrient homeostasis and viability.","[Efeyan, Alejo; Zoncu, Roberto; Chang, Steven; Wolfson, Rachel L.; Kirak, Oktay; Sabatini, David M.] Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Efeyan, Alejo; Zoncu, Roberto; Chang, Steven; Wolfson, Rachel L.; Sabatini, David M.] Broad Inst Harvard & Massachusetts Inst Technol, Seven Cambridge Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Efeyan, Alejo; Zoncu, Roberto; Chang, Steven; Wolfson, Rachel L.; Sabatini, David M.] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Efeyan, Alejo; Zoncu, Roberto; Chang, Steven; Wolfson, Rachel L.; Sabatini, David M.] MIT, David H Koch Inst Integrat Canc Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Efeyan, Alejo; Zoncu, Roberto; Chang, Steven; Wolfson, Rachel L.; Sabatini, David M.] MIT, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Gumper, Iwona; Snitkin, Harriet; Sabatini, David D.] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, New York, NY 10016 USA","Sabatini, DM (reprint author), Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, 9 Cambridge Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",sabatini@wi.mit.edu,"Kirak, Oktay/H-6347-2013","Kirak, Oktay/0000-0002-6524-4685; /0000-0002-1446-7256","National Institutes of Health [R01 CA129105, R01 CA103866, R37 AI047389]; American Federation for Aging; Starr Foundation; Koch Institute Frontier Research Program; Ellison Medical Foundation; Human Frontiers Science Program; Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research; LAM Foundation","We thank members of the Sabatini laboratory for suggestions, and A.

Even though it has an important role in responses against bloodborne antigens, lymphocyte migration in the marginal zone has not been intravitally visualized due to challenges associated with achieving adequate imaging depth in this abdominal organ. Here we develop a two-photon microscopy procedure to study marginal zone and follicular B-cell movement in the live mouse spleen. We show that marginal zone B cells are highly motile and exhibit long membrane extensions. Marginal zone B cells shuttle between the marginal zone and follicles with at least one-fifth of the cells exchanging between compartments per hour, a behaviour that explains their ability to deliver antigens rapidly from the open blood circulation to the secluded follicles. Follicular B cells also transit from follicles to the marginal zone, but unlike marginal zone B cells, they fail to undergo integrin-mediated adhesion, become caught in fluid flow and are carried into the red pulp. Follicular B-cell egress via the marginal zone is sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-1 (S1PR1)-dependent. This study shows that marginal zone B cells migrate continually between marginal zone and follicles and establishes the marginal zone as a site of S1PR1-dependent B-cell exit from follicles.

The pre-eminent tumour suppressor p53 has an important role in the induction and maintenance of senescence, but how it carries out this function remains poorly understood(1-3). In addition, although increasing evidence supports the idea that metabolic changes underlie many cell-fate decisions and p53-mediated tumour suppression, few connections between metabolic enzymes and senescence have been established. Here we describe a new mechanism by which p53 links these functions. We show that p53 represses the expression of the tricarboxylic-acid-cycle-associated malic enzymes ME1 and ME2 in human and mouse cells. Both malic enzymes are important for NADPH production, lipogenesis and glutamine metabolism, but ME2 has a more profound effect. Through the inhibition of malic enzymes, p53 regulates cell metabolism and proliferation. Downregulation of ME1 and ME2 reciprocally activates p53 through distinct MDM2- and AMP-activated protein kinase-mediated mechanisms in a feed-forward manner, bolstering this pathway and enhancing p53 activation. Downregulation of ME1 and ME2 also modulates the outcome of p53 activation, leading to strong induction of senescence, but not apoptosis, whereas enforced expression of either malic enzyme suppresses senescence. Our findings define physiological functions of malic enzymes, demonstrate a positive-feedback mechanism that sustains p53 activation, and reveal a connection between metabolism and senescence mediated by p53.","[Jiang, Peng; Du, Wenjing; Mancuso, Anthony; Wellen, Kathryn E.; Yang, Xiaolu] Univ Penn, Sch Med, Dept Canc Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Jiang, Peng; Du, Wenjing; Mancuso, Anthony; Wellen, Kathryn E.; Yang, Xiaolu] Univ Penn, Sch Med, Abramson Family Canc Res Inst, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Yang, XL (reprint author), Univ Penn, Sch Med, Dept Canc Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",xyang@mail.med.upenn.edu,"Jiang, Peng/A-1946-2013",,National Institutes of Health [CA088868]; US Department of Defense [W81XWH-10-1-0468],"We thank M.

Well-validated small RNA pathway cofactors such as these show distinctive patterns of conservation or divergence in particular animal, plant, fungal and protist species. We compared 86 divergent eukaryotic genome sequences to discern sets of proteins that show similar phylogenetic profiles with known small RNA cofactors. A large set of additional candidate small RNA cofactors have emerged from functional genomic screens for defects in miRNA-or short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated repression in Caenorhabditis elegans and Dro-sophila melanogaster(1,2), and from proteomic analyses of proteins co-purifying with validated small RNA pathway proteins(3,4). The phylogenetic profiles of many of these candidate small RNA pathway proteins are similar to those of known small RNA cofactor proteins. We used a Bayesian approach to integrate the phylogenetic profile analysis with predictions from diverse transcriptional coregulation and proteome interaction data sets to assign a probability for each protein for a role in a small RNA pathway. Testing high-confidence candidates from this analysis for defects in RNAi silencing, we found that about one-half of the predicted small RNA cofactors are required for RNAi silencing. Many of the newly identified small RNA pathway proteins are orthologues of proteins implicated in RNA splicing. In support of a deep connection between the mechanism of RNA splicing and small-RNA-mediated gene silencing, the presence of the Argonaute proteins and other small RNA components in the many species analysed strongly correlates with the number of introns in those species.","[Tabach, Yuval; Hayes, Gabriel D.; Newman, Martin A.; Gabel, Harrison; Kamath, Ravi; Yacoby, Keren; Chapman, Brad; Garcia, Susana M.; Borowsky, Mark; Ruvkun, Gary] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Mol Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Tabach, Yuval; Hayes, Gabriel D.; Newman, Martin A.; Gabel, Harrison; Kamath, Ravi; Garcia, Susana M.; Borowsky, Mark; Ruvkun, Gary] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Billi, Allison C.; Kim, John K.] Univ Michigan, Inst Life Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Billi, Allison C.; Kim, John K.] Univ Michigan, Dept Human Genet, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Zuk, Or] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA","Ruvkun, G (reprint author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Mol Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",ruvkun@molbio.mgh.harvard.edu,,"Chapman, Brad/0000-0002-3026-1856","NIH [GM088565, GM44619, GM098647]; Pew Charitable Trusts","We thank T.

The first general transcription factor to bind gene promoters is transcription factor IID (TFIID). TFIID triggers pre-initiation complex formation, functions as a coactivator by interacting with transcriptional activators and reads epigenetic marks(1-3). TFIID is a megadalton-sized multiprotein complex composed of TATA-box-binding protein (TBP) and 13 TBP-associated factors (TAFs)(3). Despite its crucial role, the detailed architecture and assembly mechanism of TFIID remain elusive. Histone fold domains are prevalent in TAFs, and histone-like tetramer and octamer structures have been proposed in TFIID4-6. A functional core-TFIID subcomplex was revealed in Drosophila nuclei, consisting of a subset of TAFs (TAF4, TAF5, TAF6, TAF9 and TAF12)(7). These core subunits are thought to be present in two copies in holo-TFIID, in contrast to TBP and other TAFs that are present in a single copy(8), conveying a transition from symmetry to asymmetry in the TFIID assembly pathway. Here we present the structure of human core-TFIID determined by cryoelectron microscopy at 11.6 angstrom resolution. Our structure reveals a two-fold symmetric, interlaced architecture, with pronounced protrusions, that accommodates all conserved structural features of the TAFs including the histone folds. We further demonstrate that binding of one TAF8-TAF10 complex breaks the original symmetry of core-TFIID. We propose that the resulting asymmetric structure serves as a functional scaffold to nucleate holo-TFIID assembly, by accreting one copy each of the remaining TAFs and TBP.","[Bieniossek, Christoph; Schaffitzel, Christiane; Garzoni, Frederic; Chaillet, Maxime; Berger, Imre] UJF CNRS EMBL, Unite Mixte Int UMI 3265, European Mol Biol Lab EMBL Grenoble Outstn, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France; [Bieniossek, Christoph; Schaffitzel, Christiane; Garzoni, Frederic; Chaillet, Maxime; Berger, Imre] UJF CNRS EMBL, Unite Mixte Int UMI 3265, Unit Virus Host Cell Interact UVHCI, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France; [Papai, Gabor; Schultz, Patrick] IGBMC, Dept Integrated Struct Biol, F-67404 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France; [Papai, Gabor; Scheer, Elisabeth; Tora, Laszlo; Schultz, Patrick] INSERM, U964, F-67400 Paris, France; [Papai, Gabor; Scheer, Elisabeth; Tora, Laszlo; Schultz, Patrick] CNRS Illkirch, UMR7104, F-67000 Strasbourg, France; [Papai, Gabor; Scheer, Elisabeth; Tora, Laszlo; Schultz, Patrick] Univ Strasbourg, F-67000 Strasbourg, France; [Scheer, Elisabeth; Tora, Laszlo] IGBMC, Dept Funct Genom & Canc, F-67404 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France; [Papadopoulos, Petros] Erasmus MC, Dept Cell Biol, NL-3015 GE Rotterdam, Netherlands","Schultz, P (reprint author), IGBMC, Dept Integrated Struct Biol, 1 Rue Laurent Fries,BP10142, F-67404 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France.",patrick.schultz@igbmc.fr; iberger@embl.fr,"Papadopoulos, Petros/B-1913-2015","Papadopoulos, Petros/0000-0002-8342-329X; Chaillet, Maxime/0000-0001-6812-4147; Papai, Gabor/0000-0002-2779-8679; Berger-Schaffitzel, Christiane Helene/0000-0002-1516-9760; Tora, Laszlo/0000-0001-7398-2250",European Research Council (ERC); Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR); EC Marie Curie Action; EC; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM); Centre National pour la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Association pour la Recherche sur le Cancer (ARC); Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale (FRM); ANR; ChromAct; TFIID-Complexes,"We thank all members of the Berger, Schultz and Tora laboratories for advice and discussions.

The hydrophilic V-1 portion is known as a rotary motor, in which a central axis DF complex rotates inside a hexagonally arranged catalytic A(3)B(3) complex using ATP hydrolysis energy, but the molecular mechanism is not well defined owing to a lack of high-resolution structural information. We previously reported on the in vitro expression, purification and reconstitution of Enterococcus hirae V-1-ATPase from the A(3)B(3) and DF complexes(2,3). Here we report the asymmetric structures of the nucleotide-free (2.8 angstrom) and nucleotide-bound (3.4 angstrom) A(3)B(3) complex that demonstrate conformational changes induced by nucleotide binding, suggesting a binding order in the right-handed rotational orientation in a cooperative manner. The crystal structures of the nucleotide-free (2.2 angstrom) and nucleotide-bound (2.7 angstrom) V-1-ATPase are also reported. The more tightly packed nucleotide-binding site seems to be induced by DF binding, and ATP hydrolysis seems to be stimulated by the approach of a conserved arginine residue.

The response of the Greenland ice sheet to the warmer-than-present climate of the Eemian has thus remained unclear. Here we present the new North Greenland Eemian Ice Drilling ('NEEM') ice core and show only a modest ice-sheet response to the strong warming in the early Eemian. We reconstructed the Eemian record from folded ice using globally homogeneous parameters known from dated Greenland and Antarctic ice-core records. On the basis of water stable isotopes, NEEM surface temperatures after the onset of the Eemian (126,000 years ago) peaked at 8 +/- 4 degrees Celsius above the mean of the past millennium, followed by a gradual cooling that was probably driven by the decreasing summer insolation. Between 128,000 and 122,000 years ago, the thickness of the northwest Greenland ice sheet decreased by 400 +/- 250 metres, reaching surface elevations 122,000 years ago of 130 +/- 300 metres lower than the present. Extensive surface melt occurred at the NEEM site during the Eemian, a phenomenon witnessed when melt layers formed again at NEEM during the exceptional heat of July 2012. With additional warming, surface melt might become more common in the future.","[Dahl-Jensen, D.; Balslev-Clausen, D.; Blunier, T.; Buchardt, S. L.; Buizert, C.; Clausen, H.

A widely accepted model posits that LTP requires the cytoplasmic carboxyl tail (C-tail) of the AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) receptor subunit GluA1. To find the minimum necessary requirement of the GluA1 C-tail for LTP in mouse CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons, we used a single-cell molecular replacement strategy to replace all endogenous AMPA receptors with transfected subunits. In contrast to the prevailing model, we found no requirement of the GluA1 C-tail for LTP. In fact, replacement with the GluA2 subunit showed normal LTP, as did an artificially expressed kainate receptor not normally found at these synapses. The only conditions under which LTP was impaired were those with markedly decreased AMPA receptor surface expression, indicating a requirement for a reserve pool of receptors. These results demonstrate the synapse's remarkable flexibility to potentiate with a variety of glutamate receptor subtypes, requiring a fundamental change in our thinking with regard to the core molecular events underlying synaptic plasticity.","[Granger, Adam J.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Grad Program Neurosci, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Shi, Yun; Lu, Wei; Cerpas, Manuel; Nicoll, Roger A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Cellular & Mol Pharmacol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Nicoll, RA (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Cellular & Mol Pharmacol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",nicoll@cmp.uscf.edu,"Shi, Yun/B-5623-2009",,National Science Foundation; National Institute of Health,"We thank A.

Wave heating may be the prevalent mechanism in quiet solar periods and may contribute to heating the corona to 1,500,000K (refs 1-3). The active corona needs additional heating to reach 2,000,000-4,000,000 K; this heat has been theoretically proposed(6-12) to come from the reconnection and unravelling of magnetic 'braids'. Evidence favouring that process has been inferred(13,14), but has not been generally accepted because observations are sparse and, in general, the braided magnetic strands that are thought(1-3,15-17) to have an angular width of about 0.2 arc seconds have not been resolved(10,18-20). Fine-scale braiding has been seen(21,22) in the chromosphere but not, until now, in the corona. Here we report observations, at a resolution of 0.2 arc seconds, of magnetic braids in a coronal active region that are reconnecting, relaxing and dissipating sufficient energy to heat the structures to about 4,000,000K. Although our 5-minute observations cannot unambiguously identify the field reconnection and subsequent relaxation as the dominant heating mechanism throughout active regions, the energy available from the observed field relaxation in our example is ample for the observed heating.","[Golub, L.; Korreck, K.

In gaseous matter, an extremely low temperature can be obtained in diluted atomic gases by Doppler cooling(2), and laser cooling of ultradense gas has been demonstrated by collisional redistribution of radiation(3). In solid-state materials, laser cooling is achieved by the annihilation of phonons, which are quanta of lattice vibrations, during anti-Stokes luminescence. Since the first experimental demonstration in glasses doped with rare-earth metals(4), considerable progress has been made, particularly in ytterbium-doped glasses or crystals: recently a record was set of cooling to about 110 kelvin from the ambient temperature, surpassing the thermoelectric Peltier cooler(5,6). It would be interesting to realize laser cooling in semiconductors, in which excitonic resonances dominate(7-9), rather than in systems doped with rare-earth metals, where atomic resonances dominate. However, so far no net cooling in semiconductors has been achieved despite much experimental(10-12) and theoretical(7-9,13,14) work, mainly on group-III-V gallium arsenide quantum wells. Here we report a net cooling by about 40 kelvin in a semiconductor using group-II-VI cadmium sulphide nanoribbons, or nanobelts, starting from 290 kelvin. We use a pump laser with a wavelength of 514 nanometres, and obtain an estimated cooling efficiency of about 1.3 per cent and an estimated cooling power of 180 microwatts. At 100 kelvin, 532-nm pumping leads to a net cooling of about 15 kelvin with a cooling efficiency of about 2.0 per cent. We attribute the net laser cooling in cadmium sulphide nanobelts to strong coupling between excitons and longitudinal optical phonons (LOPs), which allows the resonant annihilation of multiple LOPs in luminescence up-conversion processes, high external quantum efficiency and negligible background absorption. Our findings suggest that, alternatively, group-II-VI semiconductors with strong exciton-LOP coupling could be harnessed to achieve laser cooling and open the way to optical refrigeration based on semiconductors.","[Zhang, Jun; Li, Dehui; Chen, Renjie; Xiong, Qihua] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Phys & Math Sci, Div Phys & Appl Phys, Singapore 637371, Singapore; [Xiong, Qihua] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Div Microelect, Singapore 639798, Singapore","Xiong, QH (reprint author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Phys & Math Sci, Div Phys & Appl Phys, Singapore 637371, Singapore.",qihua@ntu.edu.sg,"Xiong, Qihua/A-4979-2011; Li, Dehui/A-5061-2013; Chen, Renjie/B-5639-2017; Zhang, Jun/K-7978-2012","Xiong, Qihua/0000-0002-2555-4363; Chen, Renjie/0000-0002-3145-6882; Li, Dehui/0000-0002-5945-220X; Zhang, Jun/0000-0002-9831-6796",Singapore National Research Foundation [NRF-RF2009-06]; Singapore Ministry of Education [MOE2011-T2-2-051]; Nanyang Technological University [M58113004],We thank M.

Such ideas have been researched extensively, using single-molecule magnets(4,5) and molecules with a metal ion(6) or nitrogen vacancy(7) as localized spin-carrying centres for storage and for realizing logic operations(8). However, the electronic coupling between the spin centres of these molecules is rather weak, which makes construction of quantum memory registers a challenging task(9). In this regard, delocalized carbon-based radical species with unpaired spin, such as phenalenyl(10), have shown promise. These phenalenyl moieties, which can be regarded as graphene fragments, are formed by the fusion of three benzene rings and belong to the class of open-shell systems. The spin structure of these molecules responds to external stimuli(11,12) (such as light, and electric and magnetic fields), which provides novel schemes for performing spin memory and logic operations. Here we construct a molecular device using such molecules as templates to engineer interfacial spin transfer resulting from hybridization and magnetic exchange interaction with the surface of a ferromagnet; the device shows an unexpected interfacial magnetoresistance of more than 20 per cent near room temperature. Moreover, we successfully demonstrate the formation of a nanoscale magnetic molecule with a well-defined magnetic hysteresis on ferromagnetic surfaces. Owing to strong magnetic coupling with the ferromagnet, such independent switching of an adsorbed magnetic molecule has been unsuccessful with single-molecule magnets(13). Our findings suggest the use of chemically amenable phenalenyl-based molecules as a viable and scalable platform for building molecular-scale quantum spin memory and processors for technological development.","[Raman, Karthik V.; Kamerbeek, Alexander M.; Moodera, Jagadeesh S.] MIT, Francis Bitter Natl Magnet Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Raman, Karthik V.] MIT, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Mukherjee, Arup; Sen, Tamal K.; Mandal, Swadhin K.] Indian Inst Sci Educ & Res IISER Kolkata, Dept Chem Sci, Mohanpur 741252, India; [Atodiresei, Nicolae; Caciuc, Vasile; Bluegel, Stefan] Forschungszentrum Julich, Peter Grunberg Inst, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Atodiresei, Nicolae; Caciuc, Vasile; Bluegel, Stefan] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Adv Simulat, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Atodiresei, Nicolae; Caciuc, Vasile; Bluegel, Stefan] JARA, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Lazic, Predrag] Rudjer Boskovic Inst, Div Theoret Phys, HR-10002 Zagreb, Croatia; [Michel, Reent; Stalke, Dietmar] Univ Gottingen, Inst Anorgan Chem, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Muenzenberg, Markus] Univ Gottingen, Inst Phys 1, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Moodera, Jagadeesh S.] MIT, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Raman, KV (reprint author), IBM India Res Lab, Bangalore 560045, Karnataka, India.",vkarthik@mit.edu; n.atodiresei@fz-juelich.de; swadhin.mandal@iiserkol.ac.in; moodera@mit.edu,"Lazic, Predrag/K-1908-2012; Munzenberg, Markus/B-1251-2010; Caciuc, Vasile/H-8649-2013; Blugel, Stefan/J-8323-2013; Mukherjee, Dr. Arup/L-8660-2013","Munzenberg, Markus/0000-0002-1332-5678; Caciuc, Vasile/0000-0002-4814-2417; Blugel, Stefan/0000-0001-9987-4733; Mukherjee, Dr. Arup/0000-0002-2498-8821; Atodiresei, Nicolae/0000-0002-8203-1227","Office of Naval Research (ONR) [N00014-09-1-0177]; National Science Foundation [DMR 0504158, ULFR 09-0532-01]; University of Groningen; IISER-Kolkata; CSIR, India [01(2369)/10/EMR-II]; German Science foundation [SFB 602, SPP 1538]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [1178]; Danish National Research Foundation (DNRF); Land Niedersachsen","We thank J.

An alternative is to grow lignocellulosic (cellulosic) crops on 'marginal' lands(9). Cellulosic feedstocks can have positive environmental outcomes(10,11) and could make up a substantial proportion of future energy portfolios(12,13). However, the availability of marginal lands for cellulosic feedstock production, and the resulting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, remains uncertain. Here we evaluate the potential for marginal lands in ten Midwestern US states to produce sizeable amounts of biomass and concurrently mitigate GHG emissions. In a comparative assessment of six alternative cropping systems over 20 years, we found that successional herbaceous vegetation, once well established, has a direct GHG emissions mitigation capacity that rivals that of purpose-grown crops (-851 +/- 46 grams of CO2 equivalent emissions per square metre per year (gCO(2)e m(-2) yr(-1))). If fertilized, these communities have the capacity to produce about 63 +/- 5 gigajoules of ethanol energy per hectare per year. By contrast, an adjacent, no-till corn-soybean-wheat rotation produces on average 41 +/- 1 gigajoules of biofuel energy per hectare per year and has a net direct mitigation capacity of -397 +/- 32 gCO(2)e m(-2) yr(-1); a continuous corn rotation would probably produce about 62 +/- 7 gigajoules of biofuel energy per hectare per year, with 13% less mitigation. We also perform quantitative modelling of successional vegetation on marginal lands in the region at a resolution of 0.4 hectares, constrained by the requirement that each modelled location be within 80 kilometres of a potential biorefinery. Our results suggest that such vegetation could produce about 21 gigalitres of ethanol per year from around 11 million hectares, or approximately 25 per cent of the 2022 target for cellulosic biofuel mandated by the US Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, with no initial carbon debt nor the indirect land-use costs associated with food-based biofuels. Other regional-scale aspects of biofuel sustainability(2), such as water quality(11,14) and biodiversity(15), await future study.","[Gelfand, Ilya; Sahajpal, Ritvik; Zhang, Xuesong; Izaurralde, R.

These types of behaviour are often assumed to be separated in space and to occur on two different types of fault segment: one with stable, rate-strengthening friction and the other with rate-weakening friction that leads to stick-slip(2-5). The 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake with moment magnitude M-w = 9.0 challenged such assumptions by accumulating its largest seismic slip in the area that had been assumed to be creeping(6-10). Here we propose a model in which stable, rate-strengthening behaviour at low slip rates(11,12) is combined with coseismic weakening due to rapid shear heating of pore fluids(13-16), allowing unstable slip to occur in segments that can creep between events. The model parameters are based on laboratory measurements on samples from the fault of the M-w 7.6 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake(17). The long-term slip behaviour of the model, which we examine using a unique numerical approach that includes all wave effects(16,18), reproduces and explains a number of both long-term and coseismic observations-some of them seemingly contradictory-about the faults at which the Tohoku-Oki and Chi-Chi earthquakes occurred, including there being more high-frequency radiation from areas of lower slip(8,19-21), the largest seismic slip in the Tohoku-Oki earthquake having occurred in a potentially creeping segment(6,7), the overall pattern of previous events in the area(8) and the complexity of the Tohoku-Oki rupture(9). The implication that earthquake rupture may break through large portions of creeping segments, which are at present considered to be barriers, requires a re-evaluation of seismic hazard in many areas.","[Noda, Hiroyuki] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Inst Res Earth Evolut, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan; [Lapusta, Nadia] CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Lapusta, Nadia] CALTECH, Div Engn & Appl Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Noda, H (reprint author), Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Inst Res Earth Evolut, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan.",hnoda@jamstec.go.jp,"Noda, Hiroyuki/B-1573-2014",,US National Science Foundation (NSF) [EAR 0548277]; Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC); Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation; NSF [EAR-0106924]; USGS [02HQAG0008],"This study was supported by the US National Science Foundation (NSF) (grant EAR 0548277), the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation.

The processing of milk, particularly the production of cheese, would have been a critical development because it not only allowed the preservation of milk products in a non-perishable and transportable form, but also it made milk a more digestible commodity for early prehistoric farmers(6-10). The finding of abundant milk residues in pottery vessels from seventh millennium sites from north-western Anatolia provided the earliest evidence of milk processing, although the exact practice could not be explicitly defined(1). Notably, the discovery of potsherds pierced with small holes appear at early Neolithic sites in temperate Europe in the sixth millennium BC and have been interpreted typologically as 'cheese-strainers'(10), although a direct association with milk processing has not yet been demonstrated. Organic residues preserved in pottery vessels have provided direct evidence for early milk use in the Neolithic period in the Near East and south-eastern Europe, north Africa, Denmark and the British Isles, based on the delta C-13 and Delta C-13 values of the major fatty acids in milk(1-4). Here we apply the same approach to investigate the function of sieves/strainer vessels, providing direct chemical evidence for their use in milk processing. The presence of abundant milk fat in these specialized vessels, comparable in form to modern cheese strainers(11), provides compelling evidence for the vessels having being used to separate fat-rich milk curds from the lactose-containing whey. This new evidence emphasizes the importance of pottery vessels in processing dairy products, particularly in the manufacture of reduced-lactose milk products among lactose-intolerant prehistoric farming communities(6,7).","[Salque, Melanie; Evershed, Richard P.] Univ Bristol, Sch Chem, Organ Geochem Unit, Bristol BS8 1TS, Avon, England; [Bogucki, Peter I.] Princeton Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Pyzel, Joanna] Univ Gdansk, Inst Archaeol, PL-80851 Gdansk, Poland; [Sobkowiak-Tabaka, Iwona] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Archaeol & Ethnol, Ctr Prehist & Medieval Res, PL-61612 Poznan, Poland; [Grygiel, Ryszard] Museum Archaeol & Ethnog Lodz, PL-91415 Lodz, Poland; [Szmyt, Marzena] Poznan Archaeol Museum, PL-61781 Poznan, Poland","Evershed, RP (reprint author), Univ Bristol, Sch Chem, Organ Geochem Unit, Cantocks Close, Bristol BS8 1TS, Avon, England.",r.p.evershed@bristol.ac.uk,,"Roffet-Salque, Melanie/0000-0001-9508-788X",7th EU framework Marie Curie Initial Training Networks [FP7-ITN-215362-2],We thank the 7th EU framework Marie Curie Initial Training Networks (FP7-ITN-215362-2) for a Ph.D. studentship to M.

We find that the genome organization, gene structure and functional content of these species are more similar to those of some invertebrate deuterostome genomes (for example, amphioxus and sea urchin) than those of other protostomes that have been sequenced to date (flies, nematodes and flatworms). The conservation of these genomic features enables us to expand the inventory of genes present in the last common bilaterian ancestor, establish the tripartite diversification of bilaterians using multiple genomic characteristics and identify ancient conserved long-and short-range genetic linkages across metazoans. Superimposed on this broadly conserved pan-bilaterian background we find examples of lineage-specific genome evolution, including varying rates of rearrangement, intron gain and loss, expansions and contractions of gene families, and the evolution of clade-specific genes that produce the unique content of each genome.","[Simakov, Oleg; Marletaz, Ferdinand; Larsson, Tomas; Arendt, Detlev] European Mol Biol Lab, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Simakov, Oleg; Cho, Sung-Jin; Edsinger-Gonzales, Eric; Kuo, Dian-Han; Weisblat, David A.; Rokhsar, Daniel S.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Havlak, Paul; Lv, Jie; Putnam, Nicholas H.] Rice Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Houston, TX 77251 USA; [Hellsten, Uffe; Grimwood, Jane; Chapman, Jarrod A.; Shapiro, Harris; Aerts, Andrea; Otillar, Robert P.; Terry, Astrid Y.; Boore, Jeffrey L.; Grigoriev, Igor V.; Rokhsar, Daniel S.] US DOE, Joint Genome Inst, Walnut Creek, CA 94598 USA; [Savage, Robert] Williams Coll, Dept Biol, Thompson Biol Lab, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA; [Osoegawa, Kazutoyo; de Jong, Pieter] Childrens Hosp Oakland, Res Inst, Oakland, CA 94609 USA; [Grimwood, Jane] Hudson Alpha Inst Biotechnol, Huntsville, AL 35806 USA; [Lindberg, David R.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Seaver, Elaine C.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Kewalo Marine Lab, Honolulu, HI 96813 USA; [Putnam, Nicholas H.] Rice Univ, Dept Biochem & Cell Biol, Houston, TX 77251 USA; [Rokhsar, Daniel S.] Okinawa Inst Sci & Technol, Onna Son, Okinawa 9040495, Japan","Putnam, NH (reprint author), Rice Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, POB 1892, Houston, TX 77251 USA.",nputnam@gmail.com; dsrokhsar@gmail.com,"; Putnam, Nicholas/B-9968-2008; Simakov, Oleg/G-4572-2015; Lindberg, David/D-8138-2011","Kuo, Dian-Han/0000-0002-6461-2562; Terry, Astrid/0000-0002-5234-1224; Rokhsar, Daniel/0000-0002-8704-2224; Marletaz, Ferdinand/0000-0001-8124-4266; Grigoriev, Igor/0000-0002-3136-8903; Putnam, Nicholas/0000-0002-1315-782X; Simakov, Oleg/0000-0002-3585-4511; Edsinger, Eric/0000-0002-1012-1506; Lv, Jie/0000-0001-5071-8959","Office of Science of the US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation; National Science Foundation (NSF) [EF-0850294, I0S-0922792]; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [RO1 GM 074619]; Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds; US National Human Genome Research Institute",Work conducted by the US Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute is supported by the Office of Science of the US Department of Energy under contract no.

VTA dopamine neurons show two in vivo patterns of firing: low frequency tonic firing and high frequency phasic firing(6-8). Phasic firing of the neurons, which is well known to encode reward signals(6,7,9), is upregulated by repeated social-defeat stress, a highly validated mouse model of depression(5,8,10-13). Surprisingly, this pathophysiological effect is seen in susceptible mice only, with no apparent change in firing rate in resilient individuals(5,8). However, direct evidence-in real time-linking dopamine neuron phasic firing in promoting the susceptible (depression-like) phenotype is lacking. Here we took advantage of the temporal precision and cell-type and projection-pathway specificity of optogenetics to show that enhanced phasic firing of these neurons mediates susceptibility to social-defeat stress in freely behaving mice. We show that optogenetic induction of phasic, but not tonic, firing in VTA dopamine neurons of mice undergoing a subthreshold social-defeat paradigm rapidly induced a susceptible phenotype as measured by social avoidance and decreased sucrose preference. Optogenetic phasic stimulation of these neurons also quickly induced a susceptible phenotype in previously resilient mice that had been subjected to repeated social-defeat stress. Furthermore, we show differences in projection-pathway specificity in promoting stress susceptibility: phasic activation of VTA neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens (NAc), but not to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), induced susceptibility to social-defeat stress. Conversely, optogenetic inhibition of the VTA-NAc projection induced resilience, whereas inhibition of the VTA-mPFC projection promoted susceptibility. Overall, these studies reveal novel firing-pattern-and neural-circuit-specific mechanisms of depression.","[Chaudhury, Dipesh; Walsh, Jessica J.; Friedman, Allyson K.; Juarez, Barbara; Ku, Stacy M.; Nestler, Eric J.; Han, Ming-Hu] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Friedman Brain Inst, Dept Pharmacol & Syst Therapeut, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Walsh, Jessica J.; Juarez, Barbara; Ku, Stacy M.; Koo, Ja Wook; Ferguson, Deveroux; Christoffel, Daniel J.; Mazei-Robison, Michelle S.; Mouzon, Ezekiell; Lobo, Mary Kay; Russo, Scott J.; Nestler, Eric J.; Han, Ming-Hu] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Friedman Brain Inst, Fishberg Dept Neurosci, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Tsai, Hsing-Chen; Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Dept Bioengn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Tsai, Hsing-Chen; Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Pomeranz, Lisa; Nectow, Alexander R.; Ekstrand, Mats; Domingos, Ana; Friedman, Jeffrey M.] Rockefeller Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Mol Genet Lab, New York, NY 10056 USA; [Neve, Rachael L.] MIT, McGovern Inst Brain Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Han, MH (reprint author), Mt Sinai Sch Med, Friedman Brain Inst, Dept Pharmacol & Syst Therapeut, New York, NY 10029 USA.",ming-hu.han@mssm.edu,"Han, Ming-Hu/G-8836-2012; Lobo, Mary Kay/K-7734-2015; Mazei-Robison, Michelle/I-4304-2017","Lobo, Mary Kay/0000-0002-9419-2079; Mazei-Robison, Michelle/0000-0002-2372-1420; /0000-0002-7938-4814; Pomeranz, Lisa/0000-0002-8117-7355; Ferguson, Deveroux/0000-0001-9302-5992; Christoffel, Dan/0000-0002-6303-5134; Friedman, Allyson/0000-0002-8190-3011; russo, scott/0000-0002-6470-1805; Ekstrand, Mats/0000-0003-0019-9462","National Institute of Mental Health [R01 MH092306]; Johnson & Johnson IMHRO Rising Star Translational Research Award; National Research Service Awards [F31 MH095425, F32 MH096464]; Mount Sinai PREP [R25 GM064118]","This work was supported by the National Institute of Mental Health (R01 MH092306 to D.

Here we investigated directly the causal contributions of defined dopamine neurons to multidimensional depression-like phenotypes induced by chronic mild stress, by integrating behavioural, pharmacological, optogenetic and electrophysiological methods in freely moving rodents. We found that bidirectional control (inhibition or excitation) of specified midbrain dopamine neurons immediately and bidirectionally modulates (induces or relieves) multiple independent depression symptoms caused by chronic stress. By probing the circuit implementation of these effects, we observed that optogenetic recruitment of these dopamine neurons potently alters the neural encoding of depression-related behaviours in the downstream nucleus accumbens of freely moving rodents, suggesting that processes affecting depression symptoms may involve alterations in the neural encoding of action in limbic circuitry.","[Tye, Kay M.] MIT, Picower Inst Learning & Memory Brain & Cognit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Tye, Kay M.; Mirzabekov, Julie J.; Warden, Melissa R.; Ferenczi, Emily A.; Tsai, Hsing-Chen; Finkelstein, Joel; Kim, Sung-Yon; Adhikari, Avishek; Thompson, Kimberly R.; Andalman, Aaron S.; Gunaydin, Lisa A.; Witten, Ilana B.; Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Dept Bioengn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Ferenczi, Emily A.; Tsai, Hsing-Chen; Kim, Sung-Yon; Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Neurosci Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, CNC Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Tye, KM (reprint author), MIT, Picower Inst Learning & Memory Brain & Cognit Sci, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",kaytye@mit.edu; deissero@stanford.edu,"Tye, Kay/J-6158-2013; Adhikari, Avishek/A-3339-2012; Adhikari, Avishek/N-1284-2015; Warden, Melissa/M-9300-2016","Tye, Kay/0000-0002-2435-0182; Adhikari, Avishek/0000-0002-9187-9211; Adhikari, Avishek/0000-0002-9187-9211; Warden, Melissa/0000-0003-2240-3997; Kim, Sung-Yon/0000-0003-0791-7308",Helen Hay Whitney Foundation; NRSA [F32 MH880102]; JPB Foundation; NARSAD; Wiegers Family Fund; NIMH; NIDA; DARPA REPAIR Program; Keck Foundation; McKnight Foundation; Gatsby Charitable Foundation; Snyder Foundation; Woo Foundation; Albert Yu and Mary Bechman Foundation,"We thank T.

The tumour suppressor protein p53 (also known as TP53) influences a range of cellular metabolic processes, including glycolysis(1,2), oxidative phosphorylation(3), glutaminolysis(4,5) and anti-oxidant response(6). In contrast to its role in promoting apoptosis during DNA-damaging stress, p53 can promote cell survival during metabolic stress(7), a function that may contribute not only to tumour suppression but also to non-cancer-associated functions of p53(8). Here we show that human cancer cells rapidly use exogenous serine and that serine deprivation triggered activation of the serine synthesis pathway and rapidly suppressed aerobic glycolysis, resulting in an increased flux to the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Transient p53-p21 (also known as CDKN1A) activation and cell-cycle arrest promoted cell survival by efficiently channelling depleted serine stores to glutathione synthesis, thus preserving cellular anti-oxidant capacity. Cells lacking p53 failed to complete the response to serine depletion, resulting in oxidative stress, reduced viability and severely impaired proliferation. The role of p53 in supporting cancer cell proliferation under serine starvation was translated to an in vivo model, indicating that serine depletion has a potential role in the treatment of p53-deficient tumours.","[Maddocks, Oliver D.

Airway epithelial cells also undergo apoptosis after encountering environmental allergens(3); yet, relatively little is known about how these are cleared, and their effect on airway inflammation. Here we show that airway epithelial cells efficiently engulf apoptotic epithelial cells and secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines, dependent upon intracellular signalling by the small GTPase Rac1. Inducible deletion of Rac1 expression specifically in airway epithelial cells in a mouse model resulted in defective engulfment by epithelial cells and aberrant anti-inflammatory cytokine production. Intranasal priming and challenge of these mice with house dust mite extract or ovalbumin as allergens led to exacerbated inflammation, augmented Th2 cytokines and airway hyper-responsiveness, with decreased interleukin (IL)-10 in bronchial lavages. Rac1-deficient epithelial cells produced much higher IL-33 upon allergen or apoptotic cell encounter, with increased numbers of nuocyte-like cells(1,4,5). Administration of exogenous IL-10 'rescued' the airway inflammation phenotype in Rac1-deficient mice, with decreased IL-33. Collectively, these genetic and functional studies suggest a new role for Rac1-dependent engulfment by airway epithelial cells and in establishing the anti-inflammatory environment, and that defects in cell clearance in the airways could contribute to inflammatory responses towards common allergens.","[Juncadella, Ignacio J.; Hochreiter-Hufford, Amelia; Borish, Larry; Ravichandran, Kodi S.] Univ Virginia, Beirne Carter Ctr Immunol Res, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Juncadella, Ignacio J.; Hochreiter-Hufford, Amelia; Ravichandran, Kodi S.] Univ Virginia, Dept Microbiol, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Juncadella, Ignacio J.; Hochreiter-Hufford, Amelia; Ravichandran, Kodi S.] Univ Virginia, Ctr Cell Clearance, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Kadl, Alexandra; Shim, Yun M.; Borish, Larry] Univ Virginia, Dept Med, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Sharma, Ashish K.] Univ Virginia, Dept Surg, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Borish, Larry] Univ Virginia, Ctr Asthma & Allerg Dis, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA","Ravichandran, KS (reprint author), Univ Virginia, Beirne Carter Ctr Immunol Res, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA.",Ravi@virginia.edu,,,Immunology Training Grant; NHLBI; American Asthma Foundation; National Institutes of Health,"We thank the members of the Ravichandran laboratory for their suggestions, especially J.

Although rubella virus belongs to the same family as the mosquito-borne alphaviruses, in many respects it is more similar to other aerosol-transmitted human viruses such as the agents of measles and mumps. Although the use of the triple MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) live vaccine has limited its incidence in western countries, congenital rubella syndrome remains an important health problem in the developing world. Here we report the 1.8 angstrom resolution crystal structure of envelope glycoprotein E1, the main antigen and sole target of neutralizing antibodies against rubella virus. E1 is the main player during entry into target cells owing to its receptor-binding and membrane-fusion functions. The structure reveals the epitope and the neutralization mechanism of an important category of protecting antibodies against rubella infection. It also shows that rubella virus E1 is a class II fusion protein, which had hitherto only been structurally characterized for the arthropod-borne alphaviruses and flaviviruses. In addition, rubella virus E1 has an extensive membrane-fusion surface that includes a metal site, reminiscent of the T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin family of cellular proteins that bind phosphatidylserine lipids at the plasma membrane of cells undergoing apoptosis. Such features have not been seen in any fusion protein crystallized so far. Structural comparisons show that the class II fusion proteins from alphaviruses and flaviviruses, despite belonging to different virus families, are closer to each other than they are to rubella virus E1. This suggests that the constraints on arboviruses imposed by alternating cycles between vertebrates and arthropods resulted in more conservative evolution. By contrast, in the absence of this constraint, the strictly human rubella virus seems to have drifted considerably into a unique niche as sole member of the Rubivirus genus.","[DuBois, Rebecca M.; Vaney, Marie-Christine; Tortorici, M.

However, the full extent of RNAi functions and its endogenous targets have not been explored. Here we show that, in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, RNAi and heterochromatin factors cooperate to silence diverse loci, including sexual differentiation genes, genes encoding transmembrane proteins, and retrotransposons that are also targeted by the exosome RNA degradation machinery. In the absence of the exosome, transcripts are processed preferentially by the RNAi machinery, revealing siRNA clusters and a corresponding increase in heterochromatin modifications across large domains containing genes and retrotransposons. We show that the generation of siRNAs and heterochromatin assembly by RNAi is triggered by a mechanism involving the canonical poly(A) polymerase Pla1 and an associated RNA surveillance factor Red1, which also activate the exosome. Notably, siRNA production and heterochromatin modifications at these target loci are regulated by environmental growth conditions, and by developmental signals that induce gene expression during sexual differentiation. Our analyses uncover an interaction between RNAi and the exosome that is conserved in Drosophila, and show that differentiation signals modulate RNAi silencing to regulate developmental genes.","[Yamanaka, Soichiro; Mehta, Sameet; Reyes-Turcu, Francisca E.; Rong, Yikang; Grewal, Shiv I.

However, the molecular mechanism by which TET family enzymes regulate gene transcription remains elusive(5,6). Using protein affinity purification, here we search for functional partners of TET proteins, and find that TET2 and TET3 associate with O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase (OGT), an enzyme that by itself catalyses the addition of O-GlcNAc onto serine and threonine residues (O-GlcNAcylation) in vivo(7,8). TET2 directly interacts with OGT, which is important for the chromatin association of OGT in vivo. Although this specific interaction does not regulate the enzymatic activity of TET2, it facilitates OGT-dependent histone O-GlcNAcylation. Moreover, OGT associates with TET2 at transcription start sites. Downregulation of TET2 reduces the amount of histone 2B Ser 112 GlcNAc marks in vivo, which are associated with gene transcription regulation. Taken together, these results reveal a TET2-dependent O-GlcNAcylation of chromatin. The double epigenetic modifications on both DNA and histones by TET2 and OGT coordinate together for the regulation of gene transcription.","[Chen, Qiang; Chen, Yibin; Bian, Chunjing; Yu, Xiaochun] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, Div Mol Med & Genet, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Fujiki, Ryoji] Univ Tokyo, Inst Mol & Cellular Biosci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130032, Japan; [Fujiki, Ryoji] JST, PRESTO, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan","Yu, XC (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, Div Mol Med & Genet, 1150 W Med Ctr Dr,5560A MSRBII, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",xiayu@med.umich.edu,"Chen, Yibin/L-3533-2014; Chen, Yibin/A-3019-2015; chen, qiang/G-5031-2016","Chen, Yibin/0000-0003-1060-9373; ","National Institutes of Health [CA132755, CA130899]; University of Michigan Cancer Center; GI Peptide Research Center; Department of Defense","We thank H.

The dominant computational method for describing such systems has been density functional theory. Quantum-chemical methods-based on an explicit ansatz for the many-electron wavefunctions and, hence, potentially more accurate-have not been fully explored in the solid state owing to their computational complexity, which ranges from strongly exponential to high-order polynomial in system size. Here we report the application of an exact technique, full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo to a variety of real solids, providing reference many-electron energies that are used to rigorously benchmark the standard hierarchy of quantum-chemical techniques, up to the 'gold standard' coupled-cluster ansatz, including single, double and perturbative triple particle-hole excitation operators.

The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is strongly implicated in ASDs by means of upstream signalling; however, downstream regulatory mechanisms are ill-defined. Here we show that knockout of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 2 (4E-BP2)-an eIF4E repressor downstream of mTOR-or eIF4E overexpression leads to increased translation of neuroligins, which are postsynaptic proteins that are causally linked to ASDs. Mice that have the gene encoding 4E-BP2 (Eif4ebp2) knocked out exhibit an increased ratio of excitatory to inhibitory synaptic inputs and autistic-like behaviours (that is, social interaction deficits, altered communication and repetitive/stereotyped behaviours). Pharmacological inhibition of eIF4E activity or normalization of neuroligin 1, but not neuroligin 2, protein levels restores the normal excitation/inhibition ratio and rectifies the social behaviour deficits. Thus, translational control by eIF4E regulates the synthesis of neuroligins, maintaining the excitation-to-inhibition balance, and its dysregulation engenders ASD-like phenotypes.","[Gkogkas, Christos G.; Khoutorsky, Arkady; Rampakakis, Emmanouil; Nevarko, Tatiana; Sonenberg, Nahum] McGill Univ, Dept Biochem, Montreal, PQ H3A 1A3, Canada; [Gkogkas, Christos G.; Khoutorsky, Arkady; Rampakakis, Emmanouil; Nevarko, Tatiana; Sonenberg, Nahum] McGill Univ, Goodman Canc Res Ctr, Montreal, PQ H3A 1A3, Canada; [Ran, Israeli; Weatherill, Daniel B.; Vasuta, Cristina; Lacaille, Jean-Claude] Univ Montreal, GRSNC, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Ran, Israeli; Weatherill, Daniel B.; Vasuta, Cristina; Lacaille, Jean-Claude] Univ Montreal, Dept Physiol, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Rampakakis, Emmanouil] JSS Med Res Inc, Montreal, PQ H4S 1N8, Canada; [Yee, Stephanie; Lasko, Paul] McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H3G 0B1, Canada; [Truitt, Morgan; Ruggero, Davide] Univ Calif San Francisco, Sch Med, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Truitt, Morgan; Ruggero, Davide] Univ Calif San Francisco, Helen Diller Family Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dept Urol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Dallaire, Paul; Major, Francois] Univ Montreal, Dept Comp Sci, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Dallaire, Paul; Major, Francois] Univ Montreal, Inst Res Immunol & Canc, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Nader, Karim] McGill Univ, Dept Psychol, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada","Sonenberg, N (reprint author), McGill Univ, Dept Biochem, Montreal, PQ H3A 1A3, Canada.",jean-claude.lacaille@umontreal.ca; nahum.sonenberg@mcgill.ca,"Ran, Israeli/B-2432-2009; Lasko, Paul/C-6761-2014","Ran, Israeli/0000-0003-4824-6416; Lasko, Paul/0000-0002-4037-3501; Gkogkas, Christos/0000-0001-6281-3419","Canadian Institutes of Health Research [MOP-114994, MOP-10848, MOP-93679, MOP-44050]; Autism Speaks [7109]; Fonds de la Recherche en Sante du Quebec (FRSQ; Groupe de Recherche sur le Systeme Nerveux Central); National Institutes of Health [NIH RO1 CA154916, NIH RO1 CA140456]; Canada Research Chair in Cellular and Molecular Neurophysiology; Savoy Foundation","This work was supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (N.S., MOP-114994; J.-C.L., MOP-10848; P.D. and F.M., MOP-93679; and P.L. and N.S., MOP-44050), Autism Speaks (Grant 7109 to N.S.), and the Fonds de la Recherche en Sante du Quebec (J.-C.L.

The phenomenon is known as pulsed accretion and can affect the orbital evolution and mass distribution of young binaries(2,4), as well as the potential for planet formation(5,6). Accretion variability is a common feature of young stars, with a large range of amplitudes and timescales as measured from multi-epoch observations at optical(7,8) and infrared(9-13) wavelengths. Periodic variations consistent with pulsed accretion have been seen in only a few young binaries via optical accretion tracers(14-16), albeit intermittently with accretion luminosity variations ranging from zero to 50 per cent from orbit to orbit. Here we report that the infrared luminosity of a young protostar (of age about 10(5) years) increases by a factor of ten in roughly one week every 25.34 days. We attribute this to pulsed accretion associated with an unseen binary companion. The strength and regularity of this accretion signal is surprising; it may be related to the very young age of the system, which is a factor of ten younger than the other pulsed accretors previously studied.","[Muzerolle, James] Space Telescope Sci Inst, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Furlan, Elise] Natl Opt Astron Observ, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA; [Flaherty, Kevin] Univ Arizona, Steward Observ, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Balog, Zoltan] Max Planck Inst Astron, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Gutermuth, Robert] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Astron, Amherst, MA 01003 USA","Muzerolle, J (reprint author), Space Telescope Sci Inst, 3700 San Martin Dr, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",muzerol@stsci.edu,,"Furlan, Elise/0000-0001-9800-6248",NASA,"This work was supported in part by NASA through Spitzer and HST GO contracts.

Unlike their tighter counterparts, the stellar orbits of wide binaries continually change under the influence of the Milky Way's tidal field and impulses from other passing stars. Here we report numerical simulations demonstrating that the variable nature of wide binary star orbits dramatically reshapes the planetary systems they host, typically billions of years after formation. Contrary to previous understanding(2), wide binary companions may often strongly perturb planetary systems, triggering planetary ejections and increasing the orbital eccentricities of surviving planets. Although hitherto not recognized, orbits of giant exoplanets within wide binaries are statistically more eccentric than those around isolated stars. Both eccentricity distributions are well reproduced when we assume that isolated stars and wide binaries host similar planetary systems whose outermost giant planets are scattered beyond about 10 AU from their parent stars by early internal instabilities. Consequently, our results suggest that although wide binaries eventually remove the most distant planets from many planetary systems, most isolated giant exoplanet systems harbour additional distant, still undetected planets.","[Kaib, Nathan A.; Duncan, Martin] Queens Univ, Dept Phys, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada; [Kaib, Nathan A.] Univ Toronto, Canadian Inst Theoret Astrophys, Toronto, ON M5S 3H8, Canada; [Raymond, Sean N.] Univ Bordeaux, Observ Aquitain Sci Univers, F-33271 Floirac, France; [Raymond, Sean N.] CNRS, UMR 5804, Lab Astrophys Bordeaux, F-33271 Floirac, France","Kaib, NA (reprint author), Northwestern Univ, Ctr Interdisciplinary Explorat & Res Astrophys, 2131 Tech Dr, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",nkaib@astro.queensu.ca,,,CITA National Fellowship; Canada's NSERC,We thank J.

Nanostructuring of cBN is an effective way to improve its hardness by virtue of the Hall-Petch effect-the tendency for hardness to increase with decreasing grain size(1,2). Polycrystalline cBN materials are often synthesized by using the martensitic transformation of a graphite-like BN precursor, in which high pressures and temperatures lead to puckering of the BN layers(3). Such approaches have led to synthetic polycrystalline cBN having grain sizes as small as similar to 14 nm (refs 1, 2, 4, 5). Here we report the formation of cBN with a nanostructure dominated by fine twin domains of average thickness similar to 3.8 nm. This nanotwinned cBN was synthesized from specially prepared BN precursor nanoparticles possessing onion-like nested structures with intrinsically puckered BN layers and numerous stacking faults. The resulting nanotwinned cBN bulk samples are optically transparent with a striking combination of physical properties: an extremely high Vickers hardness (exceeding 100 GPa, the optimal hardness of synthetic diamond), a high oxidization temperature (similar to 1,294 degrees C) and a large fracture toughness (>12 MPa m(1/2), well beyond the toughness of commercial cemented tungsten carbide, similar to 10 MPa m(1/2)). We show that hardening of cBN is continuous with decreasing twin thickness down to the smallest sizes investigated, contrasting with the expected reverse Hall-Petch effect below a critical grain size or the twin thickness of similar to 10-15 nm found in metals and alloys.","[Tian, Yongjun; Xu, Bo; Yu, Dongli; Hu, Wentao; Gao, Yufei; Luo, Kun; Zhao, Zhisheng; Wang, Li-Min; Wen, Bin; He, Julong; Liu, Zhongyuan] Yanshan Univ, State Key Lab Metastable Mat Sci & Technol, Qinhuangdao 066004, Peoples R China; [Ma, Yanming] Jilin Univ, State Key Lab Superhard Mat, Changchun 130012, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yanbin] Univ Chicago, Ctr Adv Radiat Sources, Chicago, IL 60439 USA; [Jiang, Yingbing] Univ New Mexico, TEM Lab, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Tang, Chengchun] Hebei Univ Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Tianjin 300130, Peoples R China","Tian, YJ (reprint author), Yanshan Univ, State Key Lab Metastable Mat Sci & Technol, Qinhuangdao 066004, Peoples R China.",fhcl@ysu.edu.cn,"Xu, Bo/C-6925-2008; Tian, Yongjun/A-1693-2010; Ma, Yanming/A-7297-2008; Zhao, Zhisheng/G-8199-2015; Ma, Yanming/A-4982-2009","Xu, Bo/0000-0002-9804-1614; Ma, Yanming/0000-0003-3711-0011; Zhao, Zhisheng/0000-0001-8492-0151; Wang, Yanbin/0000-0001-5716-3183; Liu, Zhongyuan/0000-0002-5600-8998; Luo, Kun/0000-0002-5826-1612","Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2011CB808205, 2010CB731605]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51121061, 51172197, 11025418, 91022029]; US National Science Foundation [EAR-0968456]","We thank J.

Prior work based on analysing the instrumental record implicates both Indian(2) and Pacific(1) ocean sea surface temperatures (SSTs) as possible drivers of East African multidecadal climate variability, but the short length of the instrumental record precludes a full elucidation of the underlying physical mechanisms. Here we show that on timescales beyond the decadal, the Indian Ocean drives East African rainfall variability by altering the local Walker circulation, whereas the influence of the Pacific Ocean is minimal. Our results, based on proxy indicators of relative moisture balance for the past millennium paired with long control simulations from coupled climate models, reveal that moist conditions in coastal East Africa are associated with cool SSTs (and related descending circulation) in the eastern Indian Ocean and ascending circulation over East Africa. The most prominent event identified in the proxy record-a coastal pluvial from 1680 to 1765-occurred when Indo-Pacific warm pool SSTs reached their minimum values of the past millennium. Taken together, the proxy and model evidence suggests that Indian Ocean SSTs are the primary influence on East African rainfall over multidecadal and perhaps longer timescales.","[Tierney, Jessica E.; Anchukaitis, Kevin J.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Tierney, Jessica E.; Smerdon, Jason E.; Anchukaitis, Kevin J.; Seager, Richard] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA","Tierney, JE (reprint author), Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.",tierney@whoi.edu,"Smerdon, Jason/F-9952-2011",,"US NOAA; NSF [OCE-1203892]; NOAA [NA10OAR431037]; Office of Science, US Department of Energy; US NSF","J.E.T. acknowledges the US NOAA Climate and Global Change Postdoctoral Fellowship and NSF OCE-1203892 for support.

Alternatively, it may have taken part in whole-mantle convection and crust production over the age of the Earth(7-9); if so, it is now either a primitive refugium at the core-mantle boundary(8) or is distributed throughout the lower mantle(7,9). Here we constrain the problem using lavas from Baffin Island, West Greenland, the Ontong Java Plateau, Isla Gorgona and Fernandina (Galapagos). Olivine phenocryst compositions show that these lavas originated from a peridotite source that was about 20 per cent higher in nickel content than in the modern mid-ocean-ridge basalt source. Where data are available, these lavas also have high He-3/He-4. We propose that a less-degassed nickel-rich source formed by core-mantle interaction during the crystallization of a melt-rich layer or basal magma ocean(5,6), and that this source continues to be sampled by mantle plumes.

Although environmental perturbations of many different kinds are known to have affected long-term biological evolution, particularly during major mass extinction events(1,2), the relative importance of physical environmental factors versus biological interactions in governing rates of extinction and origination through geological time remains unknown(2). Here we use macrostratigraphic data from the Atlantic Ocean basin to show that changes in global species diversity and rates of extinction among planktonic foraminifera have been linked to tectonically and climatically forced changes in ocean circulation and chemistry from the Jurassic period to the present. Transient environmental perturbations, such as those that occurred after the asteroid impact at the end of the Cretaceous period(1) approximately 66 million years ago, and the Eocene/Oligocene greenhouse-icehouse transition(3,4) approximately 34 million years ago, are superimposed on this general long-term relationship. Rates of species origination, by contrast, are not correlated with corresponding macrostratigraphic quantities, indicating that physiochemical changes in the ocean-atmosphere system affect evolution principally by driving the synchronous extinction of lineages that originated owing to more protracted and complex interactions between biological and environmental factors.","[Peters, Shanan E.; Kelly, Daniel C.; Fraass, Andrew J.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Geosci, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Peters, SE (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Geosci, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",peters@geology.wisc.edu,"Peters, Shanan/A-5620-2013","Peters, Shanan/0000-0002-3346-4317",National Science Foundation Division of Earth Sciences (NSF EAR) [EAR 0819931]; NSF [EAR 0628719],"We thank M.

It is unclear how the environment influences natural variation in heritable behaviour(2), and whether complex behavioural differences evolve through few genetic changes, each affecting many aspects of behaviour, or through the accumulation of several genetic changes that, when combined, give rise to behavioural complexity(3). Here we show that in nature, oldfield mice (Pero-myscus polionotus) build complex burrows with long entrance and escape tunnels, and that burrow length is consistent across populations, although burrow depth varies with soil composition. This burrow architecture is in contrast with the small, simple burrows of its sister species, deer mice (P. maniculatus). When investigated under laboratory conditions, both species recapitulate their natural burrowing behaviour. Genetic crosses between the two species reveal that the derived burrows of oldfield mice are dominant and evolved through the addition of multiple genetic changes. In burrows built by first-generation backcross mice, entrancetunnel length and the presence of an escape tunnel can be uncoupled, suggesting that these traits are modular. Quantitative trait locus analysis also indicates that tunnel length segregates as a complex trait, affected by at least three independent genetic regions, whereas the presence of an escape tunnel is associated with only a single locus. Together, these results suggest that complex behaviours-in this case, a classic 'extended phenotype'(4)-can evolve through multiple genetic changes each affecting distinct behaviour modules.","[Weber, Jesse N.; Peterson, Brant K.; Hoekstra, Hopi E.] Museum Comparat Zool, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Peterson, Brant K.; Hoekstra, Hopi E.] Ctr Brain Sci, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Hoekstra, HE (reprint author), Museum Comparat Zool, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, 26 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",hoekstra@oeb.harvard.edu,"Hoekstra, Hopi/I-6690-2012","Hoekstra, Hopi/0000-0003-1431-1769",Chapman Funds for Vertebrate Locomotion; National Science Foundation [IOS-0910164]; Arnold and Mabel Beckman Young Investigator Award,"We thank D.

However, there are considerable challenges with respect to study design, data analysis and replication(1). Using pooled next-generation sequencing of 507 genes implicated in the repair of DNA in 1,150 samples, an analytical strategy focused on protein-truncating variants (PTVs) and a large-scale sequencing case-control replication experiment in 13,642 individuals, here we show that rare PTVs in the p53-inducible protein phosphatase PPM1D are associated with predisposition to breast cancer and ovarian cancer. PPM1D PTV mutations were present in 25 out of 7,781 cases versus 1 out of 5,861 controls (P = 1.12 x 10(-5)), including 18 mutations in 6,912 individuals with breast cancer (P = 2.42 x 10(-4)) and 12 mutations in 1,121 individuals with ovarian cancer (P = 3.10 x 10(-9)). Notably, all of the identified PPM1D PTVs were mosaic in lymphocyte DNA and clustered within a 370-base-pair region in the final exon of the gene, carboxy-terminal to the phosphatase catalytic domain. Functional studies demonstrate that the mutations result in enhanced suppression of p53 in response to ionizing radiation exposure, suggesting that the mutant alleles encode hyperactive PPM1D isoforms. Thus, although the mutations cause premature protein truncation, they do not result in the simple loss-of-function effect typically associated with this class of variant, but instead probably have a gain-of-function effect. Our results have implications for the detection and management of breast and ovarian cancer risk. More generally, these data provide new insights into the role of rare and of mosaic genetic variants in common conditions, and the use of sequencing in their identification.","[Ruark, Elise; Snape, Katie; Loveday, Chey; Renwick, Anthony; Seal, Sheila; Ramsay, Emma; Duarte, Silvana Del Vecchio; Warren-Perry, Margaret; Zachariou, Anna; Hanks, Sandra; Murray, Anne; Pour, Naser Ansari; Douglas, Jenny; Houlston, Richard; Turnbull, Clare; Rahman, Nazneen] Inst Canc Res, Div Genet & Epidemiol, Sutton SM2 5NG, Surrey, England; [Humburg, Peter; Rivas, Manuel A.; Gregory, Lorna; Rimmer, Andrew] Univ Oxford, Wellcome Trust Ctr Human Genet, Oxford OX3 7BN, England; [Bajrami, Ilirjana; Brough, Rachel; Rodrigues, Daniel Nava; Campion-Flora, Adriana; Reis-Filho, Jorge S.; Ashworth, Alan; Lord, Christopher J.] Inst Canc Res, Breakthrough Breast Canc Res Ctr, London SW3 6JB, England; [Brough, Rachel] Inst Canc Res, Canc Res UK Gene Funct Lab, London SW3 6JB, England; [Rivas, Manuel A.] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Clin Med, Oxford OX3 7LD, England; [Walker, Neil M.; Todd, John A.] Univ Cambridge, Addenbrookes Hosp, Cambridge Inst Med Res, Juvenile Diabet Res Fdn,Wellcome Trust Diabet & I, Cambridge CB2 0XY, England; [Yang, Tsun-Po] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Cambridge CB10 1SA, England; [Adlard, Julian W.] Chapel Allerton Hosp, Yorkshire Reg Genet Serv, Leeds LS7 4SA, W Yorkshire, England; [Barwell, Julian] Univ Hosp Leicester NHS Trust, Leicestershire Genet Ctr, Leicester LE1 5WW, Leics, England; [Berg, Jonathan] Univ Dundee, Div Med Sci, Dundee DD1 9SY, Scotland; [Brady, Angela F.] Kennedy Galton Ctr, NW Thames Reg Genet Serv, London HA1 3UJ, England; [Brewer, Carole] Royal Devon & Exeter Hosp, Peninsula Reg Genet Serv, Exeter EX1 2ED, Devon, England; [Brice, Glen] St George Hosp, SW Thames Reg Genet Serv, London SW17 0RE, England; [Chapman, Cyril] Birmingham Womens Hosp, W Midlands Reg Genet Serv, Birmingham B15 2TG, W Midlands, England; [Cook, Jackie] Sheffield Childrens NHS Fdn Trust, Sheffield Reg Genet Serv, Sheffield S10 2TH, S Yorkshire, England; [Davidson, Rosemarie] So Gen Hosp, Lab Med, W Scotland Reg Genet Serv, Glasgow G51 4TF, Lanark, Scotland; [Donaldson, Alan] Univ Hosp Bristol NHS Fdn Trust, SW Reg Genet Serv, Bristol BS2 8EG, Avon, England; [Douglas, Fiona; Henderson, Alex] Newcastle Upon Tyne Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, No Genet Serv, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 3BZ, Tyne & Wear, England; [Eccles, Diana] Univ Southampton, Southampton Univ Hosp NHS Trust, Fac Med, Southampton SO16 5YA, Hants, England; [Evans, D.

One of the hypotheses for a common molecular mechanism underlying ASDs is altered translational control resulting in exaggerated protein synthesis(3). Genetic variants in chromosome 4q, which contains theEIF4E locus, have been described in patients with autism(4,5). Importantly, a rare single nucleotide polymorphism has been identified in autism that is associated with increased promoter activity in the EIF4E gene(6). Here we show that genetically increasing the levels of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) in mice(7) results in exaggerated cap-dependent translation and aberrant behaviours reminiscent of autism, including repetitive and perseverative behaviours and social interaction deficits. Moreover, these autistic-like behaviours are accompanied by synaptic pathophysiology in the medial prefrontal cortex, striatumand hippocampus. The autistic-like behaviours displayed by the eIF4E-transgenic mice are corrected by intracerebroventricular infusions of the cap-dependent translation inhibitor 4EGI-1. Our findings demonstrate a causal relationship between exaggerated cap-dependent translation, synaptic dysfunction and aberrant behaviours associated with autism.","[Santini, Emanuela; Huynh, Thu N.; MacAskill, Andrew F.; Carter, Adam G.; Kaphzan, Hanoch; Klann, Eric] NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Pierre, Philippe] Aix Marseille Univ, Ctr Immunol Marseille Luminy, F-13288 Marseille, France; [Pierre, Philippe] INSERM, U1104, F-13288 Marseille, France; [Pierre, Philippe] CNRS, URM 7280, F-13288 Marseille, France; [Ruggero, Davide] Univ Calif San Francisco, Helen Diller Family Comprehens Canc Ctr, Sch Med, Dept Urol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Klann, E (reprint author), NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA.",eklann@cns.nyu.edu,"Huynh, Thu/I-5864-2014","Huynh, Thu/0000-0002-7625-5101; MacAskill, Andrew/0000-0002-0196-3779; pierre, philippe/0000-0003-0863-8255","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [NS034007, NS047384, NS078718]; Department of Defense CDMRP [W81XWH-11-1-0389]; NIH [CA154916]; Wellcome Trust","We would like to thank J.

Most studies that support a role for PKM-zeta in memory maintenance have used pharmacological PKM-zeta inhibitors such as the myristoylated zeta inhibitory peptide (ZIP) or chelerythrine. Here we use a genetic approach and target exon 9 of the Prkcz gene to generate mice that lack both protein kinase C-zeta (PKC-zeta) and PKM-zeta (Prkcz(-/-) mice). Prkcz(-/-) mice showed normal behaviour in a cage environment and in baseline tests of motor function and sensory perception, but displayed reduced anxiety-like behaviour. Notably, Prkcz(-/-) mice did not show deficits in learning or memory in tests of cued fear conditioning, novel object recognition, object location recognition, conditioned place preference for cocaine, or motor learning, when compared with wild-type littermates. ZIP injection into the nucleus accumbens reduced expression of cocaine-conditioned place preference in Prkcz(-/-) mice. In vitro, ZIP and scrambled ZIP inhibited PKM-zeta, PKC-iota and PKC-zeta with similar inhibition constant (K-i) values. Chelerythrine was a weak inhibitor of PKM-zeta (K-i = 76 mu M). Our findings show that absence of PKM-zeta does not impair learning and memory in mice, and that ZIP can erase reward memory even when PKM-zeta is not present.","[Lee, Anna M.; Kanter, Benjamin R.; Wang, Dan; Lim, Jana P.; Zou, Mimi E.; Qiu, Chichen; McMahon, Thomas; Dadgar, Jahan; Fischbach-Weiss, Sarah C.; Messing, Robert O.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Neurol, Ernest Gallo Clin & Res Ctr, Emeryville, CA 94608 USA","Messing, RO (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Neurol, Ernest Gallo Clin & Res Ctr, 5858 Horton St,Suite 200, Emeryville, CA 94608 USA.",romes@gallo.ucsf.edu,"Messing, Robert/D-3642-2015","Messing, Robert/0000-0002-5345-4431; Lee, Anna/0000-0003-4551-0082; Kanter, Benjamin/0000-0003-4114-090X",National Institutes of Health [AA017072]; Canadian Institute of Health Research; State of California for medical research on alcohol and drug abuse,"We thank V.

Although LTP can persist for long periods of time(1), the mechanisms underlying LTP maintenance, in the midst of ongoing protein turnover and synaptic activity, remain elusive. Sustained activation of the brain-specific protein kinase C (PKC) isoform protein kinase M-zeta (PKM-zeta) has been reported to be necessary for both LTP maintenance and long-term memory(2). Inhibiting PKM-zeta activity using a synthetic zeta inhibitory peptide (ZIP) based on the PKC-zeta pseudosubstrate sequence reverses established LTP in vitro and in vivo(3,4). More notably, infusion of ZIP eliminates memories for a growing list of experience-dependent behaviours, including active place avoidance(4), conditioned taste aversion(5), fear conditioning and spatial learning(6). However, most of the evidence supporting a role for PKM-zeta in LTP and memory relies heavily on pharmacological inhibition of PKM-zeta by ZIP. To further investigate the involvement of PKM-zeta in the maintenance of LTP and memory, we generated transgenic mice lacking PKC-zeta and PKM-zeta. We find that both conventional and conditional PKC zeta/PKM-zeta knockout mice show normal synaptic transmission and LTP at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses, and have no deficits in several hippocampal-dependent learning and memory tasks. Notably, ZIP still reverses LTP in PKC-zeta/PKM-zeta knockout mice, indicating that the effects of ZIP are independent of PKM-zeta.","[Volk, Lenora J.; Bachman, Julia L.; Johnson, Richard; Yu, Yilin; Huganir, Richard L.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Neurosci, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Huganir, RL (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Neurosci, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",rhuganir@jhmi.edu,,,"National Institute of Health [NS36715, T32MH15330]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute","We thank G.

Having bilateral rather than unilateral projections may represent a useful redundancy. However, bilateral ORN projections to the brain should also compromise the ability to lateralize odours. Nevertheless, walking or flying Drosophila reportedly turn towards the antenna that is more strongly stimulated by odour(3-5). Here we show that each ORN spike releases approximately 40% more neurotransmitter from the axon branch ipsilateral to the soma than from the contralateral branch. As a result, when an odour activates the antennae asymmetrically, ipsilateral central neurons begin to spike a few milliseconds before contralateral neurons, and at a 30 to 50% higher rate than contralateral neurons. We show that a walking fly can detect a 5% asymmetry in total ORN input to its left and right antennal lobes, and can turn towards the odour in less time than it requires the fly to complete a stride. These results demonstrate that neurotransmitter release properties can be tuned independently at output synapses formed by a single axon onto two target cells with identical functions and morphologies.

Similar to RNA interference in eukaryotes(2), these CRISPR/Cas systems use small RNAs for sequence-specific detection and neutralization of invading genomes(3). Here we describe the first examples of genes that mediate the inhibition of a CRISPR/Cas system. Five distinct 'anti-CRISPR' genes were found in the genomes of bacteriophages infecting Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Mutation of the anti-CRISPR gene of a phage rendered it unable to infect bacteria with a functional CRISPR/Cas system, and the addition of the same gene to the genome of a CRISPR/Cas-targeted phage allowed it to evade the CRISPR/Cas system. Phage-encoded anti-CRISPR genes may represent a widespread mechanism for phages to overcome the highly prevalent CRISPR/Cas systems. The existence of anti-CRISPR genes presents new avenues for the elucidation of CRISPR/Cas functional mechanisms and provides new insight into the co-evolution of phages and bacteria.","[Bondy-Denomy, Joe; Davidson, Alan R.] Univ Toronto, Dept Mol Genet, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [Pawluk, April; Davidson, Alan R.] Univ Toronto, Dept Biochem, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [Maxwell, Karen L.] Univ Toronto, Donnelly Ctr Cellular & Biomol Res, Toronto, ON M5S 3E1, Canada","Davidson, AR (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Dept Mol Genet, 100 Coll St, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada.",alan.davidson@utoronto.ca,,"Pawluk, April/0000-0002-6136-2086","Canadian Institutes for Health Research [MOP- 6279, XNE86943]; CIHR Canada Graduate Scholarship Doctoral Award","We thank D.

Some studies suggest a high rate of stem cell activity with differentiation of progenitors to cardiomyocytes(1). Other studies suggest that new cardiomyocytes are born at a very low rate(2-4), and that they may be derived from the division of pre-existing cardiomyocytes. Here we show, by combining two different pulse-chase approaches-genetic fate-mapping with stable isotope labelling, and multi-isotope imaging mass spectrometry-that the genesis of cardiomyocytes occurs at a low rate by the division of pre-existing cardiomyocytes during normal ageing, a process that increases adjacent to areas of myocardial injury. We found that cell cycle activity during normal ageing and after injury led to polyploidy and multinucleation, but also to new diploid, mononucleate cardiomyocytes. These data reveal pre-existing cardiomyocytes as the dominant source of cardiomyocyte replacement in normal mammalian myocardial homeostasis as well as after myocardial injury.","[Senyo, Samuel E.; Steinhauser, Matthew L.; Pizzimenti, Christie L.; Yang, Vicky K.; Cai, Lei; Lee, Richard T.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Div Cardiovasc, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Senyo, Samuel E.; Steinhauser, Matthew L.; Pizzimenti, Christie L.; Yang, Vicky K.; Cai, Lei; Wang, Mei; Lechene, Claude P.; Lee, Richard T.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Wu, Ting-Di; Guerquin-Kern, Jean-Luc] INSERM, U759, F-91405 Orsay, France; [Wu, Ting-Di; Guerquin-Kern, Jean-Luc] Inst Curie, Lab Microscopie Ion, F-91405 Orsay, France; [Wang, Mei; Lechene, Claude P.] Natl Resource Imaging Mass Spectrometry, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Wang, Mei; Lechene, Claude P.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Div Genet, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Lee, Richard T.] Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Lee, RT (reprint author), Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Div Cardiovasc, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",rlee@partners.org,,,"National Institutes of Health (NIH) [F32 HL108570, K08 DK090147, EB001974, AG034641, AG032977, AG040019]; American Heart Association (AHA FTF); Future Leaders in Cardiovascular Medicine; Watkins Cardiovascular Leadership Award; Ellison Medical Foundation [AG-SS-2215-08]; Harvard Stem Cell Institute","We thank J.

Low-resolution structures of the Pol II-TFIIB complex(1,2) indicated how TFIIB functions in DNA recruitment, but they lacked nucleic acids and half of the B-reader, leaving other TFIIB functions(3,4) enigmatic. Here we report crystal structures of the Pol II-TFIIB complex from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae at 3.4 angstrom resolution and of an initially transcribing complex that additionally contains the DNA template and a 6-nucleotide RNA product. The structures reveal the entire B-reader and protein-nucleic acid interactions, and together with functional data lead to a more complete understanding of transcription initiation. TFIIB partially closes the polymerase cleft to position DNA and assist in its opening. The B-reader does not reach the active site but binds the DNA template strand upstream to assist in the recognition of the initiator sequence and in positioning the transcription start site. TFIIB rearranges active-site residues, induces binding of the catalytic metal ion B, and stimulates initial RNA synthesis allosterically. TFIIB then prevents the emerging DNA-RNA hybrid duplex from tilting, which would impair RNA synthesis. When the RNA grows beyond 6 nucleotides, it is separated from DNA and is directed to its exit tunnel by the B-reader loop. Once the RNA grows to 12-13 nucleotides, it clashes with TFIIB, triggering TFIIB displacement and elongation complex formation. Similar mechanisms may underlie all cellular transcription because all eukaryotic and archaeal RNA polymerases use TFIIB-like factors(5), and the bacterial initiation factor sigma has TFIIB-like topology(1,2) and contains the loop region 3.2 that resembles the B-reader loop in location, charge and function(6-8). TFIIB and its counterparts may thus account for the two fundamental properties that distinguish RNA from DNA polymerases: primer-independent chain initiation and product separation from the template.","[Sainsbury, Sarah; Niesser, Juergen; Cramer, Patrick] Univ Munich, Gene Ctr, D-81377 Munich, Germany; [Sainsbury, Sarah; Niesser, Juergen; Cramer, Patrick] Univ Munich, Dept Biochem, Ctr Integrated Prot Sci CIPSM, D-81377 Munich, Germany","Cramer, P (reprint author), Univ Munich, Gene Ctr, Feodor Lynen Str 25, D-81377 Munich, Germany.",cramer@lmb.uni-muenchen.de,,,"Alexander-von-Humboldt Foundation; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB646, TR5, GraKo1721, SFB960]; CIPSM; NIM; European Research Council; LMUinnovativ project Bioimaging Network; Jung-Stiftung; Vallee Foundation","We thank C.

Although the monophyly of cyclostomes has been supported by recent molecular analyses, the phenotypic traits of hagfishes, especially the lack of some vertebrate-defining features and the reported endodermal origin of the adenohypophysis, have been interpreted as hagfishes exhibiting a more ancestral state than those of all other vertebrates. Furthermore, the adult anatomy of hagfishes cannot be compared easily with that of lampreys. Here we describe the craniofacial development of a series of staged hagfish embryos, which shows that their adenohypophysis arises ectodermally, consistent with the molecular phylogenetic data. This finding also allowed us to identify a pan-cyclostome pattern, one not shared by jawed vertebrates. Comparative analyses indicated that many of the hagfish-specific traits can be explained by changes secondarily introduced into the hagfish lineage. We also propose a possibility that the pan-cyclostome pattern may reflect the ancestral programme for the craniofacial development of all living vertebrates.","[Oisi, Yasuhiro] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biol, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan; [Oisi, Yasuhiro; Fujimoto, Satoko; Kuratani, Shigeru] RIKEN Ctr Dev Biol, Lab Evolutionary Morphol, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan; [Ota, Kinya G.] Acad Sinica, Inst Cellular & Organism Biol, Marine Res Stn, Yilan 26242, Taiwan; [Kuraku, Shigehiro] RIKEN Ctr Dev Biol, Genome Resource & Anal Unit, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan","Kuratani, S (reprint author), RIKEN Ctr Dev Biol, Lab Evolutionary Morphol, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan.",saizo@cdb.riken.jp,"Kuratani, Shigeru/J-4146-2014; Kuraku, Shigehiro/B-2801-2009","Kuratani, Shigeru/0000-0001-9717-7221; ",,,,50,45,51,3,112,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,10-Jan,2013,493,7431,,,,,175,180,,10.1038/nature11794,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,066YY,WOS:000313259600030,23254938.0,No,,,11/20/17,shigeru,kuratani,male,1,3,_UKuUx8AAAAJ,9413

It represents an essential component of plant cell walls but is also found in algae and bacteria. In bacteria, cellulose production frequently correlates with the formation of biofilms, a sessile, multicellular growth form. Cellulose synthesis and transport across the inner bacterial membrane is mediated by a complex of the membrane-integrated catalytic BcsA subunit and the membrane-anchored, periplasmic BcsB protein. Here we present the crystal structure of a complex of BcsA and BcsB from Rhodobacter sphaeroides containing a translocating polysaccharide. The structure of the BcsA-BcsB translocation intermediate reveals the architecture of the cellulose synthase, demonstrates how BcsA forms a cellulose-conducting channel, and suggests a model for the coupling of cellulose synthesis and translocation in which the nascent polysaccharide is extended by one glucose molecule at a time.","[Morgan, Jacob L.

The X-ray and radio emission are coupled in such Galactic sources; the radio emission originates in a relativistic jet thought to be launched from the innermost regions near the black hole(4,5), with the most powerful emission occurring when the rate of infalling matter approaches a theoretical maximum (the Eddington limit). Only four such maximal sources are known in the Milky Way(6), and the absorption of soft X-rays in the interstellar medium hinders the determination of the causal sequence of events that leads to the ejection of the jet. Here we report radio and X-ray observations of a bright new X-ray source in the nearby galaxy M 31, whose peak luminosity exceeded 10(39) erg s(-1). The radio luminosity is extremely high and shows variability on a timescale of tens of minutes, arguing that the source is highly compact and powered by accretion close to the Eddington limit onto a black hole of stellar mass. Continued radio and X-ray monitoring of such sources should reveal the causal relationship between the accretion flow and the powerful jet emission.","[Middleton, Matthew J.; Roberts, Timothy P.; Harris, Jonathan; Daniel, Michael; Miah, Junayd; Done, Chris] Univ Durham, Dept Phys, Durham DH1 3LE, England; [Middleton, Matthew J.; Markoff, Sera] Astron Inst Anton Pannekoek, NL-1098 XH Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Miller-Jones, James C.

The high stellar accretion rate(10) would deplete the inner disk(11) in less than one year, and to sustain the observed accretion matter must therefore flow from the outer disk and cross the gap. In dynamical models, the putative protoplanets channel outer-disk material into gap-crossing bridges that feed stellar accretion through the inner disk(12). Here we report observations of diffuse CO gas inside the gap, with denser HCO+ gas along gap-crossing filaments. The estimated flow rate of the gas is in the range of 7 x 10(-9) to 2 x 10(-7) solar masses per year, which is sufficient to maintain accretion onto the star at the present rate.","[Casassus, Simon; van der Plas, Gerrit; Sebastian Perez, M.; Menard, Francois; Salinas, Vachail] Univ Chile, Dept Astron, Santiago, Chile; [Dent, William R.

The ability to generate arbitrary radiation patterns with large-scale phased arrays has long been pursued. Although it is extremely expensive and cumbersome to deploy large-scale radiofrequency phased arrays(2), optical phased arrays have a unique advantage in that the much shorter optical wavelength holds promise for large-scale integration(3). However, the short optical wavelength also imposes stringent requirements on fabrication. As a consequence, although optical phased arrays have been studied with various platforms(4-8) and recently with chip-scale nanophotonics(9-12), all of the demonstrations so far are restricted to one-dimensional or small-scale two-dimensional arrays. Here we report the demonstration of a large-scale two-dimensional nanophotonic phased array (NPA), in which 64 x 64 (4,096) optical nanoantennas are densely integrated on a silicon chip within a footprint of 576 mu m x 576 mu m with all of the nanoantennas precisely balanced in power and aligned in phase to generate a designed, sophisticated radiation pattern in the far field. We also show that active phase tunability can be realized in the proposed NPA by demonstrating dynamic beam steering and shaping with an 8 x 8 array. This work demonstrates that a robust design, together with state-of-the-art complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology, allows large-scale NPAs to be implemented on compact and inexpensive nanophotonic chips. In turn, this enables arbitrary radiation pattern generation using NPAs and therefore extends the functionalities of phased arrays beyond conventional beam focusing and steering, opening up possibilities for large-scale deployment in applications such as communication, laser detection and ranging, three-dimensional holography and biomedical sciences, to name just a few.","[Sun, Jie; Timurdogan, Erman; Yaacobi, Ami; Hosseini, Ehsan Shah; Watts, Michael R.] MIT, Elect Res Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Watts, MR (reprint author), MIT, Elect Res Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",mwatts@mit.edu,"shah hosseini, ehsan/C-1584-2013; Timurdogan, Erman/H-8262-2013; Sun, Jie/B-9394-2013","shah hosseini, ehsan/0000-0003-2486-202X; Timurdogan, Erman/0000-0001-5893-5245; ",Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) of the United States [HR0011-12-2-0007]; DARPA POEM [HR0011-11-C-0100],"We thank K.

Being abundant in nature, colloids also find increasingly important applications in science and technology, ranging from direct probing of kinetics in crystals and glasses(2) to fabrication of third-generation quantum-dot solar cells(3). Because naturally occurring colloids have a shape that is typically determined by minimization of interfacial tension (for example, during phase separation) or faceted crystal growth(1), their surfaces tend to have minimum-area spherical or topologically equivalent shapes such as prisms and irregular grains (all continuously deformable-homeomorphic-to spheres). Although toroidal DNA condensates and vesicles with different numbers of handles can exist(4-7) and soft matter defects can be shaped as rings(8) and knots(9), the role of particle topology in colloidal systems remains unexplored. Here we fabricate and study colloidal particles with different numbers of handles and genus g ranging from 1 to 5. When introduced into a nematic liquid crystal-a fluid made of rod-like molecules that spontaneously align along the so-called 'director'(10)-these particles induce three-dimensional director fields and topological defects dictated by colloidal topology. Whereas electric fields, photothermal melting and laser tweezing cause transformations between configurations of particle-induced structures, three-dimensional nonlinear optical imaging reveals that topological charge is conserved and that the total charge of particle-induced defects always obeys predictions of the Gauss-Bonnet and Poincare-Hopf index theorems(11-13). This allows us to establish and experimentally test the procedure for assignment and summation of topological charges in three-dimensional director fields. Our findings lay the groundwork for new applications of colloids and liquid crystals that range from topological memory devices(14), through new types of self-assembly(15-23), to the experimental study of low-dimensional topology(6,7,11-13).","[Senyuk, Bohdan; Liu, Qingkun; Smalyukh, Ivan I.] Univ Colorado, Dept Phys, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Senyuk, Bohdan; Smalyukh, Ivan I.] Univ Colorado, Mat Sci & Engn Program, Dept Elect Comp & Energy Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Senyuk, Bohdan; Smalyukh, Ivan I.] Univ Colorado, Crystal Mat Res Ctr, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Liu, Qingkun; He, Sailing] Zhejiang Univ, Ctr Opt & Elect Res, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Kamien, Randall D.; Lubensky, Tom C.] Univ Penn, Dept Phys & Astron, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Kusner, Robert B.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Math & Stat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Smalyukh, Ivan I.] Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Renewable & Sustainable Energy Inst, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Smalyukh, Ivan I.] Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","Smalyukh, II (reprint author), Univ Colorado, Dept Phys, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",ivan.smalyukh@colorado.edu,"He, Sailing/C-2438-2009; Smalyukh, Ivan/C-2955-2011; Senyuk, Bohdan/M-3185-2014; Zhejiang University, Dep.

In particular, the height of these regions is influenced by climatic gradients controlling the altitude where glacial and periglacial processes are the most active, and as a result, surface area is focused just below the snowline altitude(1-9). Yet the effect of this distinct glacial hypsometric signature on glacial extent and therefore on continued glacial erosion has not previously been examined. Here we show how this topographic configuration influences the climatic sensitivity of Alpine glaciers, and how the development of a glacial hypsometric distribution influences the intensity of glaciations on timescales of more than a few glacial cycles. We find that the relationship between variations in climate and the resulting variation in areal extent of glaciation changes drastically with the degree of glacial modification in the landscape. First, in landscapes with novel glaciations, a nearly linear relationship between climate and glacial area exists. Second, in previously glaciated landscapes with extensive area at a similar elevation, highly nonlinear and rapid glacial expansions occur with minimal climate forcing, once the snowline reaches the hypsometric maximum. Our results also show that erosion associated with glaciations before the mid-Pleistocene transition at around 950,000 years ago probably preconditioned the landscape-producing glacial landforms and hypsometric maxima-such that ongoing cooling led to a significant change in glacial extent and erosion, resulting in more extensive glaciations and valley deepening in the late Pleistocene epoch. We thus provide a mechanism that explains previous observations from exposure dating(10) and low-temperature thermochronology(11) in the European Alps, and suggest that there is a strong topographic control on the most recent Quaternary period glaciations.","[Pedersen, Vivi Kathrine] Univ Bergen, Dept Earth Sci, N-5007 Bergen, Norway; [Egholm, David Lundbek] Aarhus Univ, Dept Geosci, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark","Pedersen, VK (reprint author), Univ Bergen, Dept Earth Sci, Allegaten 41, N-5007 Bergen, Norway.",vivi.pedersen@geo.uib.no,"Egholm, David/G-8227-2011; Pedersen, Vivi/H-7865-2016","Pedersen, Vivi/0000-0002-5004-8438; Egholm, David Lundbek/0000-0003-4045-240X",Danish Council for Independent Research; Inge Lehmanns Fund; Danish Council for Independent Research under the Sapere Aude Programme,V.K.P. thanks the Danish Council for Independent Research and Inge Lehmanns Fund for funding this research.

Although carbonatitic melt could be stable 250 km or less beneath mid-oceanic ridges(1,2), owing to the small fraction (similar to 0.03 wt%) its effects on the mantle properties are unclear. Geophysical measurements, however, suggest that melts of greater volume may be present at similar to 200km (refs 3-5) but large melt fractions are thought to be restricted to shallower depths. Here we present experiments on carbonated peridotites over 2-5 GPa that constrain the location and the slope of the onset of silicate melting in the mantle. We find that the pressure-temperature slope of carbonated silicate melting is steeper than the solidus of volatile-free peridotite and that silicate melting of dry peridotite + CO2 beneath ridges commences at similar to 180 km. Accounting for the effect of 50-200 p.p.m. H2O on freezing point depression, the onset of silicate melting for a sub-ridge mantle with similar to 100 p.p.m. CO2 becomes as deep as similar to 220-300 km. We suggest that, on a global scale, carbonated silicate melt generation at a redox front similar to 250-200 km deep(6), with destabilization of metal and majorite in the upwelling mantle, explains the oceanic low-velocity zone and the electrical conductivity structure of the mantle. In locally oxidized domains, deeper carbonated silicate melt may contribute to the seismic X-discontinuity. Furthermore, our results, along with the electrical conductivity of molten carbonated peridotite(7) and that of the oceanic upper mantle(5), suggest that mantle at depth is CO2-rich but H2O-poor. Finally, carbonated silicate melts restrict the stability of carbonatite in the Earth's deep upper mantle, and the inventory of carbon, H2O and other highly incompatible elements at ridges becomes controlled by the flux of the former.","[Dasgupta, Rajdeep; Mallik, Ananya; Tsuno, Kyusei] Rice Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Withers, Anthony C.; Hirschmann, Marc M.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Earth Sci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Hirth, Greg] Brown Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Providence, RI 02912 USA","Dasgupta, R (reprint author), Rice Univ, Dept Earth Sci, 6100 Main St,MS 126, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",Rajdeep.Dasgupta@rice.edu,"Dasgupta, Rajdeep/C-7252-2009; Withers, Anthony/J-4302-2012; Mallik, Ananya/I-5252-2013; Hirschmann, marc/B-9455-2016","Dasgupta, Rajdeep/0000-0001-5392-415X; Withers, Anthony/0000-0003-4835-4281; Mallik, Ananya/0000-0001-7458-094X; Hirschmann, marc/0000-0003-1213-6645",National Science Foundation; Packard fellowship,We thank C.

Large-scale surveys of human genetic variation have reported signatures of recent explosive population growth(4-6), notable for an excess of rare genetic variants, suggesting that many mutations arose recently. To more quantitatively assess the distribution of mutation ages, we resequenced 15,336 genes in 6,515 individuals of European American and African American ancestry and inferred the age of 1,146,401 autosomal single nucleotide variants (SNVs). We estimate that approximately 73% of all protein-coding SNVs and approximately 86% of SNVs predicted to be deleterious arose in the past 5,000-10,000 years. The average age of deleterious SNVs varied significantly across molecular pathways, and disease genes contained a significantly higher proportion of recently arisen deleterious SNVs than other genes. Furthermore, European Americans had an excess of deleterious variants in essential and Mendelian disease genes compared to African Americans, consistent with weaker purifying selection due to the Out-of-Africa dispersal. Our results better delimit the historical details of human protein-coding variation, show the profound effect of recent human history on the burden of deleterious SNVs segregating in contemporary populations, and provide important practical information that can be used to prioritize variants in disease-gene discovery.","[Fu, Wenqing; O'Connor, Timothy D.; Shendure, Jay; Nickerson, Deborah A.; Bamshad, Michael J.; Akey, Joshua M.] Univ Washington, Dept Genome Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Jun, Goo; Kang, Hyun Min; Abecasis, Goncalo] Univ Michigan, Dept Biostat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Leal, Suzanne M.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Human Genet, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Gabriel, Stacey; Altshuler, David] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Bamshad, Michael J.] Univ Washington, Dept Pediat, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Fu, WQ (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Genome Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",wqfu@u.washington.edu; akeyj@u.washington.edu,"; Abecasis, Goncalo/B-7840-2010; Liu, Xiaoming/C-2743-2008; Altshuler, David/A-4476-2009; de Bakker, Paul/B-8730-2009; Singleton, Andrew/C-3010-2009; Jun, Goo/M-5235-2016; Jun, Goo/F-1941-2017","Seshadri, Sudha/0000-0001-6135-2622; Liu, Xiaoming/0000-0001-8285-5528; Altshuler, David/0000-0002-7250-4107; de Bakker, Paul/0000-0001-7735-7858; Shendure, Jay/0000-0002-1516-1865; Quinlan, Aaron/0000-0003-1756-0859; Jun, Goo/0000-0003-0891-0204; Jun, Goo/0000-0003-0891-0204; Abecasis, Goncalo/0000-0003-1509-1825; Turner, Emily/0000-0001-9040-9229","National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI); NHLBI [RC2 HL-103010, RC2 HL-102923, RC2 HL-102924, RC2 HL-102925, RC2 HL-102926]","We acknowledge the support of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI), the contributions of the research institutions that participated in this study, the study investigators, field staff and study participants who created this resource for biomedical research, and the Population Genetics Project Team of the NHLBI.

In Drosophila larvae, two types of sensory neurons, class III and class IV dendritic arborization neurons, tile the body wall. The mechanotransduction channel PIEZO in class IV neurons is essential for sensing noxious mechanical stimuli but is not involved in gentle touch(2). On the basis of electrophysiological-recording, calcium-imaging and behavioural studies, here we report that class III dendritic arborization neurons are touch sensitive and contribute to gentle-touch sensation. We further identify NOMPC (No mechanoreceptor potential C), a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of ion channels, as a mechanotransduction channel for gentle touch. NOMPC is highly expressed in class III neurons and is required for their mechanotransduction. Moreover, ectopic NOMPC expression confers touch sensitivity to the normally touch-insensitive class IV neurons. In addition to the critical role of NOMPC in eliciting gentle-touch-mediated behavioural responses, expression of this protein in the Drosophila S2 cell line also gives rise to mechanosensitive channels in which ion selectivity can be altered by NOMPC mutation, indicating that NOMPC is a pore-forming subunit of a mechanotransduction channel. Our study establishes NOMPC as a bona fide mechanotransduction channel that satisfies all four criteria proposed for a channel to qualify as a transducer of mechanical stimuli(3) and mediates gentle-touch sensation. Our study also suggests that different mechanosensitive channels may be used to sense gentle touch versus noxious mechanical stimuli.","[Yan, Zhiqiang; Zhang, Wei; He, Ye; Gorczyca, David; Xiang, Yang; Cheng, Li E.; Meltzer, Shan; Jan, Lily Yeh; Jan, Yuh Nung] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Physiol, Howard Hughes Med Inst, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Yan, Zhiqiang; Zhang, Wei; He, Ye; Gorczyca, David; Xiang, Yang; Cheng, Li E.; Meltzer, Shan; Jan, Lily Yeh; Jan, Yuh Nung] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem, Howard Hughes Med Inst, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Yan, Zhiqiang; Zhang, Wei; He, Ye; Gorczyca, David; Xiang, Yang; Cheng, Li E.; Meltzer, Shan; Jan, Lily Yeh; Jan, Yuh Nung] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biophys, Howard Hughes Med Inst, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA","Jan, YN (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Physiol, Howard Hughes Med Inst, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA.",yuhnung.jan@ucsf.edu,"zhang, wei/H-7371-2014","zhang, wei/0000-0002-1648-3364; Yan, Zhiqiang/0000-0003-4714-2076; Jan, Yuh Nung/0000-0003-1367-6299; Jan, Lily/0000-0003-3938-8498","Long-Term Fellowship from the Human Frontier Science Program; National Institutes of Health [R37NS040929, 5R01MH084234]","We thank C.

How metabolic programs are coupled with NSPC activity remains unknown. Here we show that fatty acid synthase (Fasn), the key enzyme of de novo lipogenesis(2), is highly active in adult NSPCs and that conditional deletion of Fasn in mouse NSPCs impairs adult neurogenesis. The rate of de novo lipid synthesis and subsequent proliferation of NSPCs is regulated by Spot14, a gene previously implicated in lipid metabolism(3-5), that we found to be selectively expressed in low proliferating adult NSPCs. Spot14 reduces the availability of malonyl-CoA(6), which is an essential substrate for Fasn to fuel lipogenesis. Thus, we identify here a functional coupling between the regulation of lipid metabolism and adult NSPC proliferation.","[Knobloch, Marlen; Braun, Simon M. G.; Machado, Raquel A.

Here we show that a 3.7-kilobase lncRNA, terminal differentiation-induced ncRNA (TINCR), controls human epidermal differentiation by a post-transcriptional mechanism. TINCR is required for high messenger RNA abundance of key differentiation genes, many of which are mutated in human skin diseases, including FLG, LOR, ALOXE3, ALOX12B, ABCA12, CASP14 and ELOVL3. TINCR-deficient epidermis lacked terminal differentiation ultrastructure, including keratohyalin granules and intact lamellar bodies. Genome-scale RNA interactome analysis revealed that TINCR interacts with a range of differentiation mRNAs. TINCR-mRNA interaction occurs through a 25-nucleotide 'TINCR box' motif that is strongly enriched in interacting mRNAs and required for TINCR binding. A high-throughput screen to analyse TINCR binding capacity to approximately 9,400 human recombinant proteins revealed direct binding of TINCR RNA to the staufen1 (STAU1) protein. STAU1-deficient tissue recapitulated the impaired differentiation seen with TINCR depletion. Loss of UPF1 and UPF2, both of which are required for STAU1-mediated RNA decay, however, did not have differentiation effects. Instead, the TINCR-STAU1 complex seems to mediate stabilization of differentiation mRNAs, such as KRT80. These data identify TINCR as a key lncRNA required for somatic tissue differentiation, which occurs through lncRNA binding to differentiation mRNAs to ensure their expression.","[Kretz, Markus; Siprashvili, Zurab; Chu, Ci; Webster, Dan E.; Zehnder, Ashley; Qu, Kun; Lee, Carolyn S.; Flockhart, Ross J.; Groff, Abigail F.; Chow, Jennifer; Johnston, Danielle; Kim, Grace E.; Spitale, Robert C.; Flynn, Ryan A.; Zheng, Grace X.

However, the precise mechanism underlying how indolent tumours with PTEN alterations acquire metastatic potential remains poorly understood. Recent studies suggest that upregulation of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta signalling triggered by PTEN loss will form a growth barrier as a defence mechanism to constrain prostate cancer progression(5), underscoring that TGF-beta signalling might represent a pre-invasive checkpoint to prevent PTEN-mediated prostate tumorigenesis. Here we show that COUP transcription factor II (COUP-TFII, also known as NR2F2)(6-9), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, serves as a key regulator to inhibit SMAD4-dependent transcription, and consequently overrides the TGF-beta-dependent checkpoint for PTEN-null indolent tumours. Overexpression of COUP-TFII in the mouse prostate epithelium cooperates with PTEN deletion to augment malignant progression and produce an aggressive metastasis-prone tumour. The functional counteraction between COUP-TFII and SMAD4 is reinforced by genetically engineered mouse models in which conditional loss of SMAD4 diminishes the inhibitory effects elicited by COUP-TFII ablation. The biological significance of COUP-TFII in prostate carcinogenesis is substantiated by patient sample analysis, in which COUP-TFII expression or activity is tightly correlated with tumour recurrence and disease progression, whereas it is inversely associated with TGF-beta signalling. These findings reveal that the destruction of the TGF-beta-dependent barrier by COUP-TFII is crucial for the progression of PTEN-mutant prostate cancer into a life-threatening disease, and supports COUP-TFII as a potential drug target for the intervention of metastatic human prostate cancer.","[Qin, Jun; Wu, San-Pin; Dai, Fangyan; Xie, Xin; Cheng, Chiang-Min; Feng, Xin-Hua; Tsai, Shaw-Jenq; Tsai, Ming-Jer; Tsai, Sophia Y.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Creighton, Chad J.] Baylor Coll Med, Dan L Duncan Canc Ctr, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Dai, Fangyan; Lin, Xia; Feng, Xin-Hua] Baylor Coll Med, Michael E DeBakey Dept Surg, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Frolov, Anna; Ayala, Gustavo; Ittmann, Michael M.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Pathol & Immunol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Tsai, Shaw-Jenq] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Physiol, Coll Med, Tainan 701, Taiwan; [Tsai, Ming-Jer; Tsai, Sophia Y.] Baylor Coll Med, Program Dev Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Tsai, MJ (reprint author), Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",mtsai@bcm.edu; stsai@bcm.edu,"Dai, Fangyan /J-8927-2016",,"DERC Center [P30 DK079638]; National Institutes of Health [DK62434, DK59820, DK45641, HL76448]; Dan L.

Insulin resistance contributes to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus and the onset of Alzheimer's disease(3); aberrant signalling occurs in diverse cancers, exacerbated by crosstalk with the homologous type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R)(4). Despite more than three decades of investigation, the three-dimensional structure of the insulin-insulin receptor complex has proved elusive, confounded by the complexity of producing the receptor protein. Here we present the first view, to our knowledge, of the interaction of insulin with its primary binding site on the insulin receptor, on the basis of four crystal structures of insulin bound to truncated insulin receptor constructs. The direct interaction of insulin with the first leucine-rich-repeat domain (L1) of insulin receptor is seen to be sparse, the hormone instead engaging the insulin receptor carboxy-terminal alpha-chain (alpha CT) segment, which is itself remodelled on the face of L1 upon insulin binding. Contact between insulin and L1 is restricted to insulin B-chain residues. The aCT segment displaces the B-chain C-terminal beta-strand away from the hormone core, revealing the mechanism of a long-proposed conformational switch in insulin upon receptor engagement. This mode of hormone-receptor recognition is novel within the broader family of receptor tyrosine kinases(5). We support these findings by photo-crosslinking data that place the suggested interactions into the context of the holoreceptor and by isothermal titration calorimetry data that dissect the hormone-insulin receptor interface. Together, our findings provide an explanation for a wealth of biochemical data from the insulin receptor and IGF1R systems relevant to the design of therapeutic insulin analogues.","[Menting, John G.; Margetts, Mai B.; Kong, Geoffrey K. -W.; Smith, Brian J.; Ward, Colin W.; Lawrence, Michael C.] Walter & Eliza Hall Inst Med Res, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia; [Whittaker, Jonathan; Whittaker, Linda J.; Weiss, Michael A.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Smith, Brian J.] La Trobe Univ, La Trobe Inst Mol Sci, Dept Chem, Melbourne, Vic 3086, Australia; [Watson, Christopher J.; Dodson, Guy G.; Brzozowski, Andrzej M.] Univ York, Dept Chem, York Struct Biol Lab, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Zakova, Lenka; Kletvikova, Emilia; Jiracek, Jiri] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Inst Organ Chem & Biochem, Vvi, CR-16610 Prague, Czech Republic; [Chan, Shu Jin; Steiner, Donald F.] Univ Chicago, Dept Med, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Lawrence, Michael C.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Med Biol, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia","Lawrence, MC (reprint author), Walter & Eliza Hall Inst Med Res, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia.",michael.weiss@case.edu; lawrence@wehi.edu.au,"Jiracek, Jiri/A-7124-2008; Smith, Brian/F-8282-2011; Lawrence, Michael/A-5357-2009; Zakova, Lenka/A-7119-2008","Jiracek, Jiri/0000-0003-3848-2773; Smith, Brian/0000-0003-0498-1910; ","Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) [516729, 575539, 1005896]; Hazel and Pip Appel Fund; NHMRC [361646]; Victorian State Government; NIH [DK40949, DK13914, DK20595]; American Diabetes Association [1-11INI-31]; Grant Agency of the Czech Republic [P207/11/P430]; Research Project of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic [RVO: 61388963]; BBSRC; UoY Research Priming Fund","This Letter is dedicated to our co-author, the late Guy Dodson, in recognition of his lifetime contribution to the study of the structure of insulin.

GCRs and CNVs underlie human genomic disorders(1) and are a feature of cancer(2). During cancer development, environmental factors and oncogene-driven proliferation promote replication stress. Resulting GCRs and CNVs are proposed to contribute to cancer development and therapy resistance(3). When stress arrests replication, the replisome remains associated with the fork DNA(stalled fork) and is protected by the inter-S-phase checkpoint. Stalled forks efficiently resume when the stress is relieved. However, if the polymerases dissociate from the fork (fork collapse) or the fork structure breaks (broken fork), replication restart can proceed either by homologous recombination or microhomology-primed re-initiation(4,5). Here we ascertain the consequences of replication with a fork restarted by homologous recombination in fission yeast. We identify a new mechanism of chromosomal rearrangement through the observation that recombination-restarted forks have a considerably high propensity to execute a U-turn at small inverted repeats (up to 1 in 40 replication events). We propose that the error-prone nature of restarted forks contributes to the generation of GCRs and gene amplification in cancer, and to non-recurrent CNVs in genomic disorders.","[Mizuno, Ken'Ichi; Miyabe, Izumi; Schalbetter, Stephanie A.; Carr, Antony M.; Murray, Johanne M.] Univ Sussex, Genome Damage & Stabil Ctr, Brighton BN1 9RQ, E Sussex, England","Carr, AM (reprint author), Univ Sussex, Genome Damage & Stabil Ctr, Brighton BN1 9RQ, E Sussex, England.",a.m.carr@sussex.ac.uk,"Mizuno, Ken'Ichi/P-7350-2015","Mizuno, Ken'Ichi/0000-0001-8115-7808; Carr, Antony Michael/0000-0002-2028-2389",Cancer Research UK (CRUK) [C9601/A9484]; Medical Research Council (MRC) [G0600233],"We thank E.

An early event during homology-dependent repair is resection of the break to generate progressively longer 3' single-strand tails that are used to identify suitable templates for repair(1). Sister chromatids provide near-perfect sequence homology and are therefore the preferred templates during homologous recombination(2,3). To provide a bias for the use of sisters as donors, cohesin-the complex that tethers sister chromatids together(4)-is recruited to the break(5,6) to enforce physical proximity. Here we show that DNA breaks promote dissociation of cohesin loaded during the previous S phase in budding yeast, and that damage-induced dissociation of cohesin requires separase, the protease that dissolves cohesion in anaphase(7). Moreover, a separase-resistant allele of the gene coding for the alpha-kleisin subunit of cohesin, Mcd1 (also known as Scc1), reduces double-strand break resection and compromises the efficiency of repair even when loaded during DNA damage. We conclude that post-replicative DNA repair involves cohesin dissociation by separase to promote accessibility to repair factors during the coordinated cellular response to restore DNA integrity.","[McAleenan, Alexandra; Clemente-Blanco, Andres; Cordon-Preciado, Violeta; Sen, Nicholas; Esteras, Miguel; Jarmuz, Adam; Aragon, Luis] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, MRC Clin Sci Ctr, Cell Cycle Grp, London W12 0NN, England","Aragon, L (reprint author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, MRC Clin Sci Ctr, Cell Cycle Grp, Du Cane Rd, London W12 0NN, England.",luis.aragon@csc.mrc.ac.uk,"Clemente Blanco, Andres/D-4255-2014","Clemente Blanco, Andres/0000-0002-3674-0671",Intramural Research Program of the Medical Research Council UK,"We would like to thank D.

Its proton-gated inner-membrane urea channel, HpUreI, is essential for survival in the acidic environment of the stomach(3). The channel is closed at neutral pH and opens at acidic pH to allow the rapid access of urea to cytoplasmic urease(4). Urease produces NH3 and CO2, neutralizing entering protons and thus buffering the periplasm to a pH of roughly 6.1 even in gastric juice at a pH below 2.0. Here we report the structure of HpUreI, revealing six protomers assembled in a hexameric ring surrounding a central bilayer plug of ordered lipids. Each protomer encloses a channel formed by a twisted bundle of six transmembrane helices. The bundle defines a previously unobserved fold comprising a two-helix hairpin motif repeated three times around the central axis of the channel, without the inverted repeat of mammalian-type urea transporters. Both the channel and the protomer interface contain residues conserved in the AmiS/UreI superfamily, suggesting the preservation of channel architecture and oligomeric state in this superfamily. Predominantly aromatic or aliphatic side chains line the entire channel and define two consecutive constriction sites in the middle of the channel. Mutation of Trp 153 in the cytoplasmic constriction site to Ala or Phe decreases the selectivity for urea in comparison with thiourea, suggesting that solute interaction with Trp 153 contributes specificity. The previously unobserved hexameric channel structure described here provides a new model for the permeation of urea and other small amide solutes in prokaryotes and archaea.","[Strugatsky, David; Munson, Keith; Sachs, George] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Los Angeles, CA 90073 USA; [Strugatsky, David; Munson, Keith; Sachs, George] Greater W Angeles Hlth Care Syst, Los Angeles, CA 90073 USA; [McNulty, Reginald; Chen, Chiung-Kuang; Luecke, Hartmut] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Mol Biol & Biochem, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Soltis, S.

One such problem is that, above the transition temperature and near optimal doping, high-transition-temperature copper-oxide superconductors exhibit 'strange metal' behaviour that is inconsistent with being a traditional Landau Fermi liquid. Indeed, a microscopic theory of a strange-metal quantum phase could shed new light on the interesting low-temperature behaviour in the pseudogap regime and on the d-wave superconductor itself. Here we present a theory for a specific example of a strange metal-the 'd-wave metal'. Using variational wavefunctions, gauge theoretic arguments, and ultimately large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations, we show that this remarkable quantum phase is the ground state of a reasonable microscopic Hamiltonian-the usual t-J model with electron kinetic energy t and two-spin exchange J supplemented with a frustrated electron 'ring-exchange' term, which we here examine extensively on the square lattice two-leg ladder. These findings constitute an explicit theoretical example of a genuine non-Fermi-liquid metal existing as the ground state of a realistic model.","[Mishmash, Ryan V.; Garrison, James R.; Fisher, Matthew P.

We therefore developed a framework for metagenomic variation analysis and applied it to 252 faecal metagenomes of 207 individuals from Europe and North America. Using 7.4 billion reads aligned to 101 reference species, we detected 10.3 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 107,991 short insertions/deletions, and 1,051 structural variants. The average ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous polymorphism rates of 0.11 was more variable between gut microbial species than across human hosts. Subjects sampled at varying time intervals exhibited individuality and temporal stability of SNP variation patterns, despite considerable composition changes of their gut microbiota. This indicates that individual-specific strains are not easily replaced and that an individual might have a unique metagenomic genotype, which may be exploitable for personalized diet or drug intake.","[Schloissnig, Siegfried; Arumugam, Manimozhiyan; Sunagawa, Shinichi; Tap, Julien; Zhu, Ana; Waller, Alison; Mende, Daniel R.; Kultima, Jens Roat; Bork, Peer] European Mol Biol Lab, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Mitreva, Makedonka; Martin, John; Kota, Karthik; Weinstock, George M.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Genome Inst, St Louis, MO 63108 USA; [Sunyaev, Shamil R.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Genet, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Sunyaev, Shamil R.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Bork, Peer] Max Delbruck Ctr Mol Med, D-13092 Berlin, Germany","Bork, P (reprint author), European Mol Biol Lab, Meyerhofstr 1, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany.",gweinsto@genome.wustl.edu; bork@embl.de,"Weinstock, George/C-6314-2013; Bork, Peer/F-1813-2013; Arumugam, Manimozhiyan/E-1211-2011; Tap, Julien/E-5760-2010; Powell, Sean/B-2374-2009; Sunagawa, Shinichi/D-9715-2011","Weinstock, George/0000-0002-2997-4592; Bork, Peer/0000-0002-2627-833X; Arumugam, Manimozhiyan/0000-0002-0886-9101; Tap, Julien/0000-0001-8998-5413; Powell, Sean/0000-0002-0994-5911; Sunagawa, Shinichi/0000-0003-3065-0314; Mende, Daniel R./0000-0001-6831-4557; Schloissnig, Siegfried/0000-0003-4574-8330","EMBL; European Community [HEALTH-F4-2007-201052]; IHMS [HEALTH-F4-2010-261376]; National Institutes of Health [U54HG003079, U54HG004968]","The authors are grateful to J.

S. aureus encodes pore-forming bi-component leukotoxins that are toxic towards neutrophils, but also specifically target other immune cells. Despite decades since the first description of staphylococcal leukocidal activity, the host factors responsible for the selectivity of leukotoxins towards different immune cells remain unknown. Here we identify the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-receptor CCR5 as a cellular determinant required for cytotoxic targeting of subsets of myeloid cells and T lymphocytes by the S. aureus leukotoxin ED (LukED). We further demonstrate that LukED-dependent cell killing is blocked by CCR5 receptor antagonists, including the HIV drug maraviroc. Remarkably, CCR5-deficient mice are largely resistant to lethal S. aureus infection, highlighting the importance of CCR5 targeting in S. aureus pathogenesis. Thus, depletion of CCR5(+) leukocytes by LukED suggests a new immune evasion mechanism of S. aureus that can be therapeutically targeted.","[Alonzo, Francis, III; Kozhaya, Lina; Rawlings, Stephen A.; Reyes-Robles, Tamara; DuMont, Ashley L.; Landau, Nathaniel R.; Unutmaz, Derya; Torres, Victor J.] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Unutmaz, Derya] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Unutmaz, Derya] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Med, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Myszka, David G.] Biosensor Tools LLC, Salt Lake City, UT 84103 USA","Torres, VJ (reprint author), NYU, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol, New York, NY 10016 USA.",derya.unutmaz@nyumc.org; victor.torres@nyumc.org,,"Torres, Victor/0000-0002-7126-0489","New York University School of Medicine Development Funds; American Heart Association Scientist Development Grant [09SDG2060036]; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R56-AI091856-01A1]; NIH [T32-AI007180, R42-MH084372-02A1, R21-AI087973, R01-AI065303]","We thank members of the Torres laboratory, D.
