0,19,130.0,"Ubiquitin-like proteins (UBLs) can change protein function, localization or turnover by covalent attachment to lysine residues(1). Although UBLs achieve this conjugation through an intricate enzymatic cascade, their bacterial counterparts MoaD and ThiS function as sulphur carrier proteins(2,3). Here we show that Urm1p, the most ancient UBL3, acts as a sulphur carrier in the process of eukaryotic transfer RNA ( tRNA) modification, providing a possible evolutionary link between UBL and sulphur transfer. Moreover, we identify Uba4p, Ncs2p, Ncs6p and Yor251cp as components of this conserved pathway. Using in vitro assays, we show that Ncs6p binds to tRNA, whereas Uba4p first adenylates and then directly transfers sulphur onto Urm1p. Finally, functional analysis reveals that the thiolation function of Urm1p is critical to regulate cellular responses to nutrient starvation and oxidative stress conditions, most likely by increasing translation fidelity.","Leidel, Sebastian; Pedrioli, Patrick G.

1,130,144.0,"Follicular lymphoma (FL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) are the two most common non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs). Here we sequenced tumour and matched normal DNA from 13 DLBCL cases and one FL case to identify genes with mutations in B-cell NHL. We analysed RNA-seq data from these and another 113 NHLs to identify genes with candidate mutations, and then re-sequenced tumour and matched normal DNA from these cases to confirm 109 genes with multiple somatic mutations. Genes with roles in histone modification were frequent targets of somatic mutation. For example, 32% of DLBCL and 89% of FL cases had somatic mutations in MLL2, which encodes a histone methyltransferase, and 11.4% and 13.4% of DLBCL and FL cases, respectively, had mutations in MEF2B, a calcium-regulated gene that cooperates with CREBBP and EP300 in acetylating histones. Our analysis suggests a previously unappreciated disruption of chromatin biology in lymphomagenesis.","Morin, Ryan D.; Mendez-Lago, Maria; Mungall, Andrew J.; Goya, Rodrigo; Mungall, Karen L.; Corbett, Richard D.; Johnson, Nathalie A.; Severson, Tesa M.; Chiu, Readman; Field, Matthew; Jackman, Shaun; Krzywinski, Martin; Scott, David W.; Trinh, Diane L.; Tamura-Wells, Jessica; Li, Sa; Firme, Marlo R.; Rogic, Sanja; Griffith, Malachi; Chan, Susanna; Yakovenko, Oleksandr; Meyer, Irmtraud M.; Zhao, Eric Y.; Smailus, Duane; Moksa, Michelle; Chittaranjan, Suganthi; Rimsza, Lisa; Brooks-Wilson, Angela; Spinelli, John J.; Ben-Neriah, Susana; Meissner, Barbara; Woolcock, Bruce; Boyle, Merrill; McDonald, Helen; Tam, Angela; Zhao, Yongjun; Delaney, Allen; Zeng, Thomas; Tse, Kane; Butterfield, Yaron; Birol, Inanc; Holt, Rob; Schein, Jacqueline; Horsman, Douglas E.; Moore, Richard; Jones, Steven J.

2,104,437.0,"Tropical peatlands contain one of the largest pools of terrestrial organic carbon, amounting to about 89,000 teragrams(1) (1 Tg is a billion kilograms). Approximately 65 per cent of this carbon store is in Indonesia, where extensive anthropogenic degradation in the form of deforestation, drainage and fire are converting it into a globally significant source of atmospheric carbon dioxide(1-3). Here we quantify the annual export of fluvial organic carbon from both intact peat swamp forest and peat swamp forest subject to past anthropogenic disturbance. We find that the total fluvial organic carbon flux from disturbed peat swamp forest is about 50 per cent larger than that from intact peat swamp forest. By carbon-14 dating of dissolved organic carbon (which makes up over 91 per cent of total organic carbon), we find that leaching of dissolved organic carbon from intact peat swamp forest is derived mainly from recent primary production (plant growth). In contrast, dissolved organic carbon from disturbed peat swamp forest consists mostly of much older (centuries to millennia) carbon from deep within the peat column. When we include the fluvial carbon loss term, which is often ignored, in the peatland carbon budget, we find that it increases the estimate of total carbon lost from the disturbed peatlands in our study by 22 per cent. We further estimate that since 1990 peatland disturbance has resulted in a 32 per cent increase in fluvial organic carbon flux from southeast Asia-an increase that is more than half of the entire annual fluvial organic carbon flux from all European peatlands. Our findings emphasize the need to quantify fluvial carbon losses in order to improve estimates of the impact of deforestation and drainage on tropical peatland carbon balances.","Moore, Sam; Evans, Chris D.; Page, Susan E.; Garnett, Mark H.; Jones, Tim G.; Freeman, Chris; Hooijer, Aljosja; Wiltshire, Andrew J.; Limin, Suwido H.; Gauci, Vincent","Moore, S; Evans, CD; Page, SE; Garnett, MH; Jones, TG; Freeman, C; Hooijer, A; Wiltshire, AJ; Limin, SH; Gauci, V",660.0,"[Moore, Sam; Gauci, Vincent] Open Univ, Dept Environm Earth & Ecosyst, CEPSAR, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England; [Evans, Chris D.] Environm Ctr Wales, Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales; [Page, Susan E.] Univ Leicester, Dept Geog, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; [Garnett, Mark H.] Nat Environm Res Council Radiocarbon Facil, E Kilbride G75 0QF, Lanark, Scotland; [Jones, Tim G.; Freeman, Chris] Bangor Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales; [Hooijer, Aljosja] Deltares, NL-2600 MH Delft, Netherlands; [Wiltshire, Andrew J.] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England; [Limin, Suwido H.] Univ Palangka Raya, CIMTROP, Palangka Raya 73112, Central Kaliman, Indonesia",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11818,Article,1476-4687,v.gauci@open.ac.uk,+,"NERC [NE/F008813/1]; Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); Open University (CEPSAR) via the NERC Radiocarbon Facility (Environment) [1323.1008, 15.91]; DECC/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Programme [GA01101]; Royal Society; British Council","S.M. was supported by a NERC PhD studentship (NE/F008813/1).

3,111,290.0,"Adult neurogenesis arises from neural stem cells within specialized niches(1-3). Neuronal activity and experience, presumably acting on this local niche, regulate multiple stages of adult neurogenesis, from neural progenitor proliferation to new neuron maturation, synaptic integration and survival(1,3). It is unknown whether local neuronal circuitry has a direct impact on adult neural stem cells. Here we show that, in the adult mouse hippocampus, nestin-expressing radial glia-like quiescent neural stem cells(4-9) (RGLs) respond tonically to the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) by means of gamma(2)-subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors. Clonal analysis(9) of individual RGLs revealed a rapid exit from quiescence and enhanced symmetrical self-renewal after conditional deletion of gamma(2). RGLs are in close proximity to terminals expressing 67-kDa glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD67) of parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons and respond tonically to GABA released from these neurons. Functionally, optogenetic control of the activity of dentate PV+ interneurons, but not that of somatostatin-expressing or vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons, can dictate the RGL choice between quiescence and activation. Furthermore, PV+ interneuron activation restores RGL quiescence after social isolation, an experience that induces RGL activation and symmetrical division(8). Our study identifies a niche cell-signal-receptor trio and a local circuitry mechanism that control the activation and self-renewal mode of quiescent adult neural stem cells in response to neuronal activity and experience.","Song, Juan; Zhong, Chun; Bonaguidi, Michael A.; Sun, Gerald J.; Hsu, Derek; Gu, Yan; Meletis, Konstantinos; Huang, Z.

4,103,416.0,"Progress in imaging and metrology depends on exquisite control over and comprehensive characterization of wave fields. As reflected in its name, coherent diffractive imaging relies on high coherence when reconstructing highly resolved images from diffraction intensities alone without the need for image-forming lenses(1-3). Fully coherent light can be described adequately by a single pure state. Yet partial coherence and imperfect detection often need to be accounted for, requiring statistical optics or the superposition of states(4,5). Furthermore, the dynamics of samples are increasingly the very objectives of experiments(6). Here we provide a general analytic approach to the characterization of diffractive imaging systems that can be described as low-rank mixed states. We use experimental data and simulations to show how the reconstruction technique compensates for and characterizes various sources of decoherence quantitatively. Based on ptychography(7,8), the procedure is closely related to quantum state tomography and is equally applicable to high-resolution microscopy, wave sensing and fluctuation measurements. As a result, some of the most stringent experimental conditions in ptychography can be relaxed, and susceptibility to imaging artefacts is reduced. Furthermore, the method yields high-resolution images of mixed states within the sample, which may include quantum mixtures or fast stationary stochastic processes such as vibrations, switching or steady flows.","Thibault, Pierre; Menzel, Andreas","Thibault, P; Menzel, A",68.0,"[Thibault, Pierre] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Phys, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Menzel, Andreas] Paul Scherrer Inst, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11806,Article,,pierre.thibault@tum.de,71,European Research Council [279753],"We thank M.

5,118,487.0,"Pathogenic bacteria using a type III secretion system (T3SS)(1,2) to manipulate host cells cause many different infections including Shigella dysentery, typhoid fever, enterohaemorrhagic colitis and bubonic plague. An essential part of the T3SS is a hollow needle-like protein filament through which effector proteins are injected into eukaryotic host cells(3-6). Currently, the three-dimensional structure of the needle is unknown because it is not amenable to X-ray crystallography and solution NMR, as a result of its inherent non-crystallinity and insolubility. Cryo-electron microscopy combined with crystal or solution NMR subunit structures has recently provided a powerful hybrid approach for studying supramolecular assemblies(7-12), resulting in low-resolution and medium-resolution models(13-17). However, such approaches cannot deliver atomic details, especially of the crucial subunit-subunit interfaces, because of the limited cryo-electron microscopic resolution obtained in these studies. Here we report an alternative approach combining recombinant wild-type needle production, solid-state NMR, electron microscopy and Rosetta modelling to reveal the supramolecular interfaces and ultimately the complete atomic structure of the Salmonella typhimurium T3SS needle. We show that the 80-residue subunits form a right-handed helical assembly with roughly 11 subunits per two turns, similar to that of the flagellar filament of S. typhimurium. In contrast to established models of the needle in which the amino terminus of the protein subunit was assumed to be alpha-helical and positioned inside the needle, our model reveals an extended amino-terminal domain that is positioned on the surface of the needle, while the highly conserved carboxy terminus points towards the lumen.","Loquet, Antoine; Sgourakis, Nikolaos G.; Gupta, Rashmi; Giller, Karin; Riedel, Dietmar; Goosmann, Christian; Griesinger, Christian; Kolbe, Michael; Baker, David; Becker, Stefan; Lange, Adam","Loquet, A; Sgourakis, NG; Gupta, R; Giller, K; Riedel, D; Goosmann, C; Griesinger, C; Kolbe, M; Baker, D; Becker, S; Lange, A",276.0,"[Loquet, Antoine; Giller, Karin; Griesinger, Christian; Becker, Stefan; Lange, Adam] Max Planck Inst Biophys Chem, Dept NMR Based Struct Biol, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Sgourakis, Nikolaos G.; Baker, David] Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Gupta, Rashmi; Kolbe, Michael] Max Planck Inst Infect Biol, Dept Cellular Microbiol, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Riedel, Dietmar] Max Planck Inst Biophys Chem, Lab Electron Microscopy, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Griesinger, Christian] Max Planck Inst Infect Biol, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11079,Article,1476-4687,kolbe@mpiib-berlin.mpg.de; sabe@nmr.mpibpc.mpg.de; adla@nmr.mpibpc.mpg.de,+,Max Planck Society; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Fondation Bettencourt Schueller; National Institutes of Health [1 R01 GM092802-01]; EMBO; European Union [261863],"We thank T.

6,28,366.0,"Dome growth and explosive degassing are fundamental processes in the cycle of continental arc volcanism(1,2). Because both processes generate seismic energy, geophysical field studies of volcanic processes are often grounded in the interpretation of volcanic earthquakes(3). Although previous seismic studies have provided important constraints on volcano dynamics(4-6), such inversion results do not uniquely constrain magma source dimension and material properties. Here we report combined optical geodetic and seismic observations that robustly constrain the sources of long-period volcanic earthquakes coincident with frequent explosive eruptions at the volcano Santiaguito, in Guatemala. The acceleration of dome deformation, extracted from high- resolution optical image processing, is shown to be associated with recorded long-period seismic sources and the frequency content of seismic signals measured across a broadband network. These earthquake sources are observed as abrupt subvertical surface displacements of the dome, in which 20 - 50- cm uplift originates at the central vent and propagates at similar to 50 m s(-1) towards the 200- m- diameter periphery. Episodic shifts of the 20 - 80- m thick dome induce peak forces greater than 10(9) N and reflect surface manifestations of the volcanic long- period earthquakes, a broad class of volcano seismic activity that is poorly understood and observed at many volcanic centres worldwide(7). On the basis of these observations, the abrupt mass shift of solidified domes, conduit magma or magma pads may play a part in generating long- period earthquakes at silicic volcanic systems.","Johnson, Jeffrey B.; Lees, Jonathan M.; Gerst, Alexander; Sahagian, Dork; Varley, Nick","Johnson, JB; Lees, JM; Gerst, A; Sahagian, D; Varley, N",377.0,"[Johnson, Jeffrey B.] New Mexico Inst Min & Technol, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Socorro, NM 87801 USA; [Lees, Jonathan M.] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Gerst, Alexander] Univ Hamburg, Inst Geophys, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Sahagian, Dork] Lehigh Univ, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA; [Varley, Nick] Univ Colima, Fac Ciencias, Colima 28045, Mexico",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07429,Article,,jeff.johnson@ees.nmt.edu,381,"US National Science Foundation EAR [0440225, 0440054]","We thank the many personnel involved with instrumentation preparation and field work, including R.

7,77,151.0,"Despite the large evolutionary distances between metazoan species, they can show remarkable commonalities in their biology, and this has helped to establish fly and worm as model organisms for human biology(1,2). Although studies of individual elements and factors have explored similarities in gene regulation, a large-scale comparative analysis of basic principles of transcriptional regulatory features is lacking. Here we map the genome-wide binding locations of 165 human, 93 worm and 52 fly transcription regulatory factors, generating a total of 1,019 data sets from diverse cell types, developmental stages, or conditions in the three species, of which 498 (48.9%) are presented here for the first time. We find that structural properties of regulatory networks are remarkably conserved and that orthologous regulatory factor families recognize similar binding motifs in vivo and show some similar co-associations. Our results suggest that gene-regulatory properties previously observed for individual factors are general principles of metazoan regulation that are remarkably well-preserved despite extensive functional divergence of individual network connections. The comparative maps of regulatory circuitry provided here will drive an improved understanding of the regulatory underpinnings of model organism biology and how these relate to human biology, development and disease.","Boyle, Alan P.; Araya, Carlos L.; Brdlik, Cathleen; Cayting, Philip; Cheng, Chao; Cheng, Yong; Gardner, Kathryn; Hillier, LaDeana W.; Janette, Judith; Jiang, Lixia; Kasper, Dionna; Kawli, Trupti; Kheradpour, Pouya; Kundaje, Anshul; Li, Jingyi Jessica; Ma, Lijia; Niu, Wei; Rehm, E.

8,105,2.0,"The nucleus of the Milky Way is known to harbour regions of intense star formation activity as well as a supermassive black hole(1). Recent observations have revealed regions of gamma-ray emission reaching far above and below the Galactic Centre (relative to the Galactic plane), the so-called 'Fermi bubbles'(2). It is uncertain whether these were generated by nuclear star formation or by quasar-like outbursts of the central black hole(3-6) and no information on the structures' magnetic field has been reported. Here we report observations of two giant, linearly polarized radio lobes, containing three ridgelike substructures, emanating from the Galactic Centre. The lobes each extend about 60 degrees in the Galactic bulge, closely corresponding to the Fermi bubbles, and are permeated by strong magnetic fields of up to 15 microgauss. We conclude that the radio lobes originate in a biconical, star-formation-driven (rather than black-hole-driven) outflow from the Galaxy's central 200 parsecs that transports a huge amount of magnetic energy, about 10(55) ergs, into the Galactic halo. The ridges wind around this outflow and, we suggest, constitute a 'phonographic' record of nuclear star formation activity over at least ten million years.","Carretti, Ettore; Crocker, Roland M.; Staveley-Smith, Lister; Haverkorn, Marijke; Purcell, Cormac; Gaensler, B.

9,34,73.0,"Computer simulations have been playing an important role in the development of our understanding of the geodynamo(1-3), but direct numerical simulation of the geodynamo with a realistic parameter regime is still beyond the power of today's supercomputers. Difficulties in simulating the geodynamo arise from the extreme conditions of the core, which are characterized by very large or very small values of the non- dimensional parameters of the system. Among them, the Ekman number, E, has been adopted as a barometer of the distance of simulations from real core conditions, in which E is of the order of 10(-15). Following the initial computer simulations of the geodynamo(4,5), the Ekman number achieved has been steadily decreasing, with recent geodynamo simulations(6-8) performed with E of the order of 10(-6). Here we present a geodynamo simulation with an Ekman number of the order of 10(-7)-the highest-resolution simulation yet achieved, making use of 4,096 processors of the Earth Simulator. We have found that both the convection flow and magnetic field structures are qualitatively different from those found in larger- Ekman- number dynamos. The convection takes the form of sheet plumes or radial sheet jets(9), rather than the columnar cell structures(10) that are usually found. We have found that this sheet plume convection is an effective dynamo and the generated current is organized as a set of coils in the shape of helical springs or at times as a torus.","Kageyama, Akira; Miyagoshi, Takehiro; Sato, Tetsuya","Kageyama, A; Miyagoshi, T; Sato, T",1106.0,"[Kageyama, Akira; Miyagoshi, Takehiro; Sato, Tetsuya] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Earth Simulator Ctr, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07227,Article,,kage@jamstec.go.jp,1109,KAKENHI [17540404]; The Mitsubishi Foundation,"We thank P.

10,109,258.0,"Epigenetic information is frequently erased near the start of each new generation(1). In some cases, however, epigenetic information can be transmitted from parent to progeny (multigenerational epigenetic inheritance)(2). A particularly notable example of this type of epigenetic inheritance is double-stranded RNA-mediated gene silencing in Caenorhabditis elegans. This RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) can be inherited for more than five generations(3-8). To understand this process, here we conduct a genetic screen for nematodes defective in transmitting RNAi silencing signals to future generations. This screen identified the heritable RNAi defective 1 (hrde-1) gene. hrde-1 encodes an Argonaute protein that associates with small interfering RNAs in the germ cells of progeny of animals exposed to double-stranded RNA. In the nuclei of these germ cells, HRDE-1 engages the nuclear RNAi defective pathway to direct the trimethylation of histone H3 at Lys 9 (H3K9me3) at RNAi-targeted genomic loci and promote RNAi inheritance. Under normal growth conditions, HRDE-1 associates with endogenously expressed short interfering RNAs, which direct nuclear gene silencing in germ cells. In hrde-1- or nuclear RNAi-deficient animals, germline silencing is lost over generational time. Concurrently, these animals exhibit steadily worsening defects in gamete formation and function that ultimately lead to sterility. These results establish that the Argonaute protein HRDE-1 directs gene-silencing events in germ-cell nuclei that drive multigenerational RNAi inheritance and promote immortality of the germ-cell lineage. We propose that C. elegans use the RNAi inheritance machinery to transmit epigenetic information, accrued by past generations, into future generations to regulate important biological processes.","Buckley, Bethany A.; Burkhart, Kirk B.; Gu, Sam Guoping; Spracklin, George; Kershner, Aaron; Fritz, Heidi; Kimble, Judith; Fire, Andrew; Kennedy, Scott","Buckley, BA; Burkhart, KB; Gu, SG; Spracklin, G; Kershner, A; Fritz, H; Kimble, J; Fire, A; Kennedy, S",447.0,"[Buckley, Bethany A.; Burkhart, Kirk B.; Spracklin, George; Fritz, Heidi; Kimble, Judith; Kennedy, Scott] Univ Wisconsin, Lab Genet, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Gu, Sam Guoping; Fire, Andrew] Stanford Univ, Dept Pathol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Gu, Sam Guoping; Fire, Andrew] Stanford Univ, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kershner, Aaron; Fritz, Heidi] Univ Wisconsin, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Kershner, Aaron; Kimble, Judith] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biochem, Madison, WI 53706 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11352,Article,,sgkennedy@wisc.edu,451,"Pew scholar's program; Shaw scholar's program; National Institutes of Health [GM88289, GM37706, GM069454]","We thank P.

11,67,405.0,"Retroviral integration is catalysed by a tetramer of integrase (IN) assembled on viral DNA ends in a stable complex, known as the intasome(1,2). How the intasome interfaces with chromosomal DNA, which exists in the form of nucleosomal arrays, is currently unknown. Here we show that the prototype foamy virus (PFV) intasome is proficient at stable capture of nucleosomes as targets for integration. Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy reveals a multivalent intasome-nucleosome interface involving both gyres of nucleosomal DNA and one H2A-H2B heterodimer. While the histone octamer remains intact, the DNA is lifted from the surface of the H2A-H2B heterodimer to allow integration at strongly preferred superhelix location +/- 3.5 positions. Amino acid substitutions disrupting these contacts impinge on the ability of the intasome to engage nucleosomes in vitro and redistribute viral integration sites on the genomic scale. Our findings elucidate the molecular basis for nucleosome capture by the viral DNA recombination machinery and the underlying nucleosome plasticity that allows integration.","Maskell, Daniel P.; Renault, Ludovic; Serrao, Erik; Lesbats, Paul; Matadeen, Rishi; Hare, Stephen; Lindemann, Dirk; Engelman, Alan N.; Costa, Alessandro; Cherepanov, Peter","Maskell, DP; Renault, L; Serrao, E; Lesbats, P; Matadeen, R; Hare, S; Lindemann, D; Engelman, AN; Costa, A; Cherepanov, P",366.0,"[Maskell, Daniel P.; Lesbats, Paul; Cherepanov, Peter] Francis Crick Inst, Chromatin Struct & Mobile DNA, S Mimms EN6 3LD, Herts, England; [Renault, Ludovic; Costa, Alessandro] Francis Crick Inst, Clare Hall Labs, Architecture & Dynam Macromol Machines, S Mimms EN6 3LD, Herts, England; [Renault, Ludovic] Natl Inst Biol Stand & Control Microscopy & Imagi, S Mimms EN6 3QG, Herts, England; [Serrao, Erik; Engelman, Alan N.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Immunol & AIDS, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Matadeen, Rishi] Gorlaeus Lab, NeCEN, NL-2333 Leiden, Netherlands; [Hare, Stephen; Cherepanov, Peter] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Div Med, London W2 1PG, England; [Lindemann, Dirk] Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Virol, D-01307 Dresden, Germany",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14495,Article,1476-4687,alessandro.costa@crick.ac.uk; peter.cherepanov@crick.ac.uk,+,European Union [305137]; US National Institute of General Medical Sciences [GM082251-06]; US National Institutes of Health [AI070042-08]; Netherlands Centre for Electron Nanoscopy (NeCEN); Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek [175.010.2009.001]; European Union's Regional Development Fund through 'Kansen voor West' [21Z.014],"This work was supported by the European Union FP7 HIVINNOV consortium grant 305137 (to P.C.), the US National Institute of General Medical Sciences P50 grant GM082251-06 (to P.C.) and the US National Institutes of Health R01 grant AI070042-08 (to A.N.E.).

12,52,488.0,"The supply of some essential metals to pelagic ecosystems is less than the demand, so many phytoplankton have slow rates of photosynthetic production and restricted growth(1). The types and amounts of metals required by phytoplankton depends on their evolutionary history(2) and on their adaptations to metal availability(3,4), which varies widely among ocean habitats. Diatoms, for example, need considerably less iron ( Fe) to grow than chlorophyll-b-containing taxa(2), and the oceanic species demand roughly one-tenth the amount of coastal strains(5-7). Like Fe, copper (Cu) is scarce in the open sea, but notably higher concentrations of it are required for the growth of oceanic than of coastal isolates(8). Here we report that the greater Cu requirement in an oceanic diatom, Thalassiosira oceanica, is entirely due to a single Cu-containing protein, plastocyanin, which - until now - was only known to exist in organisms with chlorophyll b and cyanobacteria. Algae containing chlorophyll c, including the closely related coastal species T. weissflogii, are thought to lack plastocyanin and contain a functionally equivalent Fe-containing homologue, cytochrome c(6) (ref. 9). Copper deficiency in T. oceanica inhibits electron transport regardless of Fe status, implying a constitutive role for plastocyanin in the light reactions of photosynthesis in this species. The results suggest that selection pressure imposed by Fe limitation has resulted in the use of a Cu protein for photosynthesis in an oceanic diatom. This biochemical switch reduces the need for Fe and increases the requirement for Cu, which is relatively more abundant in the open sea.","Peers, G; Price, NM","Peers, G; Price, NM",341.0,"McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature04630,Article,,graham.peers@mail.mcgill.ca,344,,,043IB,,,CENTRIC DIATOMS; TRACE-METALS; MARINE-PHYTOPLANKTON; GENUS THALASSIOSIRA; IRON REQUIREMENT; COASTAL; CADMIUM; GROWTH; ZINC; LIMITATION,7091.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",18-May,4.0,LONDON,16572122.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,,"Peers, G (reprint author), McGill Univ, Dept Biol, 1205 Doctor Penfield Ave, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,144.0,Copper-containing plastocyanin used for electron transport by an oceanic diatom,6.0,58.0,WOS:000237593200046,488.0,441,Multidisciplinary Sciences,151,nm,price,317.0,3,male,1.0,4YcVh7UAAAAJ,1,"[0, 1474]",31122048,1,39418,1,List of AMD FX microprocessors,List of AMD FX microprocessors,0,0
13,37,238.0,"The mass and chemical composition of a star are the primary determinants of its basic physical properties - radius, temperature and luminosity - and how those properties evolve with time(1). Accordingly, two stars born at the same time, from the same natal material and with the same mass, are 'identical twins,' and as such might be expected to possess identical physical attributes. We have discovered in the Orion nebula a pair of stellar twins in a newborn binary star system(2). Each star in the binary has a mass of 0.41 +/- 0.01 solar masses, identical to within 2 per cent. Here we report that these twin stars have surface temperatures differing by similar to 300 K (similar to 10 per cent) and luminosities differing by similar to 50 per cent, both at high confidence level. Preliminary results indicate that the stars' radii also differ, by 5 - 10 per cent. These surprising dissimilarities suggest that one of the twins may have been delayed by several hundred thousand years in its formation relative to its sibling. Such a delay could only have been detected in a very young, definitively equal-mass binary system(3). Our findings reveal cosmic limits on the age synchronization of young binary stars, often used as tests for the age calibrations of star-formation models(4).","Stassun, Keivan G.; Mathieu, Robert D.; Cargile, Phillip A.; Aarnio, Alicia N.; Stempels, Eric; Geller, Aaron","Stassun, KG; Mathieu, RD; Cargile, PA; Aarnio, AN; Stempels, E; Geller, A",1079.0,"[Stassun, Keivan G.; Cargile, Phillip A.; Aarnio, Alicia N.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Mathieu, Robert D.; Geller, Aaron] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Astron, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Stempels, Eric] Univ St Andrews, Sch Phys & Astron, St Andrews KY16 9SS, Fife, Scotland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07069,Article,,keivan.stassun@vanderbilt.edu,1082,,,314WM,,,ORION NEBULA CLUSTER; SEQUENCE ECLIPSING BINARY; LOW-MASS; ABSOLUTE CALIBRATION; FORMING REGION; BROWN DWARFS; SYSTEM; 2MASS; TEMPERATURES; PHOTOMETRY,7198.0,NATURE,Nature,English,29.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",19-Jun,4.0,LONDON,18563159.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,,"Stassun, KG (reprint author), Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,39.0,Surprising dissimilarities in a newly formed pair of 'identical twin' stars,0.0,3.0,WOS:000256839900051,238.0,453,Multidisciplinary Sciences,40,aaron,geller,1008.0,2280,male,1.0,PyNOB1EAAAAJ,1,"[0, 1474]",34068800,1,5923637,1,Laura Geller,Laura Geller,1,1
14,6,81.0,"Transcription of eukaryotic messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding genes by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is triggered by the binding of transactivating proteins to enhancer DNA, which stimulates the recruitment of general transcription factors (TFIIA, B, D, E, F, H) and Pol II on the cis-linked promoter, leading to pre-initiation complex formation and transcription(1). In TFIID-dependent activation pathways, this general transcription factor containing TATA-box-binding protein is first recruited on the promoter through interaction with activators(1-3) and cooperates with TFIIA to form a committed pre-initiation complex(4). However, neither the mechanisms by which activation signals are communicated between these factors nor the structural organization of the activated pre-initiation complex are known. Here we used cryo-electron microscopy to determine the architecture of nucleoprotein complexes composed of TFIID, TFIIA, the transcriptional activator Rap1 and yeast enhancer-promoter DNA. These structures revealed the mode of binding of Rap1 and TFIIA to TFIID, as well as a reorganization of TFIIA induced by its interaction with Rap1. We propose that this change in position increases the exposure of TATA-box-binding protein within TFIID, consequently enhancing its ability to interact with the promoter. A large Rap1-dependent DNA loop forms between the activator-binding site and the proximal promoter region. This loop is topologically locked by a TFIIA-Rap1 protein bridge that folds over the DNA. These results highlight the role of TFIIA in transcriptional activation, define a molecular mechanism for enhancer-promoter communication and provide structural insights into the pathways of intramolecular communication that convey transcription activation signals through the TFIID complex.","Papai, Gabor; Tripathi, Manish K.; Ruhlmann, Christine; Layer, Justin H.; Weil, P.

This malignancy represents a heterogeneous group of tumours with characteristic molecular features, prognosis and responses to available therapy(2-4). Recurrent somatic alterations in breast cancer have been described, including mutations and copy number alterations, notably ERBB2 amplifications, the first successful therapy target defined by a genomic aberration(5). Previous DNA sequencing studies of breast cancer genomes have revealed additional candidate mutations and gene rearrangements(6-10). Here we report the whole-exome sequences of DNA from 103 human breast cancers of diverse subtypes from patients in Mexico and Vietnam compared to matched-normal DNA, together with whole-genome sequences of 22 breast cancer/normal pairs. Beyond confirming recurrent somatic mutations in PIK3CA(11), TP53(6), AKT1(12), GATA3(13) and MAP3K1(10), we discovered recurrent mutations in the CBFB transcription factor gene and deletions of its partner RUNX1. Furthermore, we have identified a recurrent MAGI3-AKT3 fusion enriched in triple-negative breast cancer lacking oestrogen and progesterone receptors and ERBB2 expression. The MAGI3-AKT3 fusion leads to constitutive activation of AKT kinase, which is abolished by treatment with an ATP-competitive AKT small-molecule inhibitor.","Banerji, Shantanu; Cibulskis, Kristian; Rangel-Escareno, Claudia; Brown, Kristin K.; Carter, Scott L.; Frederick, Abbie M.; Lawrence, Michael S.; Sivachenko, Andrey Y.; Sougnez, Carrie; Zou, Lihua; Cortes, Maria L.; Fernandez-Lopez, Juan C.; Peng, Shouyong; Ardlie, Kristin G.; Auclair, Daniel; Bautista-Pina, Veronica; Duke, Fujiko; Francis, Joshua; Jung, Joonil; Maffuz-Aziz, Antonio; Onofrio, Robert C.; Parkin, Melissa; Pho, Nam H.; Quintanar-Jurado, Valeria; Ramos, Alex H.; Rebollar-Vega, Rosa; Rodriguez-Cuevas, Sergio; Romero-Cordoba, Sandra L.; Schumacher, Steven E.; Stransky, Nicolas; Thompson, Kristin M.; Uribe-Figueroa, Laura; Baselga, Jose; Beroukhim, Rameen; Polyak, Kornelia; Sgroi, Dennis C.; Richardson, Andrea L.; Jimenez-Sanchez, Gerardo; Lander, Eric S.; Gabriel, Stacey B.; Garraway, Levi A.; Golub, Todd R.; Melendez-Zajgla, Jorge; Toker, Alex; Getz, Gad; Hidalgo-Miranda, Alfredo; Meyerson, Matthew","Banerji, S; Cibulskis, K; Rangel-Escareno, C; Brown, KK; Carter, SL; Frederick, AM; Lawrence, MS; Sivachenko, AY; Sougnez, C; Zou, LH; Cortes, ML; Fernandez-Lopez, JC; Peng, SY; Ardlie, KG; Auclair, D; Bautista-Pina, V; Duke, F; Francis, J; Jung, J; Maffuz-Aziz, A; Onofrio, RC; Parkin, M; Pho, NH; Quintanar-Jurado, V; Ramos, AH; Rebollar-Vega, R; Rodriguez-Cuevas, S; Romero-Cordoba, SL; Schumacher, SE; Stransky, N; Thompson, KM; Uribe-Figueroa, L; Baselga, J; Beroukhim, R; Polyak, K; Sgroi, DC; Richardson, AL; Jimenez-Sanchez, G; Lander, ES; Gabriel, SB; Garraway, LA; Golub, TR; Melendez-Zajgla, J; Toker, A; Getz, G; Hidalgo-Miranda, A; Meyerson, M",405.0,"[Banerji, Shantanu; Cibulskis, Kristian; Carter, Scott L.; Frederick, Abbie M.; Lawrence, Michael S.; Sivachenko, Andrey Y.; Sougnez, Carrie; Zou, Lihua; Cortes, Maria L.; Ardlie, Kristin G.; Auclair, Daniel; Duke, Fujiko; Francis, Joshua; Jung, Joonil; Onofrio, Robert C.; Parkin, Melissa; Pho, Nam H.; Ramos, Alex H.; Schumacher, Steven E.; Stransky, Nicolas; Thompson, Kristin M.; Beroukhim, Rameen; Lander, Eric S.; Gabriel, Stacey B.; Garraway, Levi A.; Golub, Todd R.; Getz, Gad; Meyerson, Matthew] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Banerji, Shantanu; Peng, Shouyong; Schumacher, Steven E.; Beroukhim, Rameen; Polyak, Kornelia; Richardson, Andrea L.; Garraway, Levi A.; Meyerson, Matthew] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Banerji, Shantanu; Baselga, Jose; Beroukhim, Rameen; Polyak, Kornelia; Sgroi, Dennis C.; Richardson, Andrea L.; Lander, Eric S.; Garraway, Levi A.; Golub, Todd R.; Toker, Alex; Meyerson, Matthew] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Rangel-Escareno, Claudia; Fernandez-Lopez, Juan C.; Quintanar-Jurado, Valeria; Rebollar-Vega, Rosa; Romero-Cordoba, Sandra L.; Uribe-Figueroa, Laura; Jimenez-Sanchez, Gerardo; Melendez-Zajgla, Jorge; Hidalgo-Miranda, Alfredo] Inst Nacl Med Genom, Mexico City 01900, DF, Mexico; [Brown, Kristin K.; Toker, Alex] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Bautista-Pina, Veronica; Maffuz-Aziz, Antonio; Rodriguez-Cuevas, Sergio] FUCAM, Inst Enfermedades Mama, Mexico City 04980, DF, Mexico; [Baselga, Jose] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Div Hematol & Oncol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Beroukhim, Rameen; Meyerson, Matthew] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Biol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Polyak, Kornelia] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Sgroi, Dennis C.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Richardson, Andrea L.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Lander, Eric S.] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Golub, Todd R.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Pediat Oncol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Golub, Todd R.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chevy Chase, MD 20815 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11154,Article,1476-4687,atoker@bidmc.harvard.edu; gadgetz@broadinstitute.org; ahidalgo@inmegen.gob.mx; matthew_meyerson@dfci.harvard.edu,409,Carlos Slim Health Institute in Mexico; CancerCare Manitoba; University of Manitoba; John Gavin Post-doctoral Fellowship; Genesis Oncology Trust of New Zealand; Mexican Council of Science and Technology (CONACyT); NIH [CA122099]; Dana-Farber/Harvard SPORE in breast cancer under NCI grant [CA089393],"We would like to thank all patients who contributed samples to this study.

16,0,40.0,"Daily oscillations of gene expression underlie circadian behaviours in multicellular organisms(1). While attention has been focused on transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms(1-3), other post-transcriptional modes have been less clearly delineated. Here we report mutants of a novel Drosophila gene twenty-four (tyf) that show weak behavioural rhythms. Weak rhythms are accompanied by marked reductions in the levels of the clock protein Period (PER) as well as more modest effects on Timeless (TIM). Nonetheless, PER induction in pacemaker neurons can rescue tyf mutant rhythms. TYF associates with a 5'-cap-binding complex, poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), as well as per and tim transcripts. Furthermore, TYF activates reporter expression when tethered to reporter messenger RNA even in vitro. Taken together, these data indicate that TYF potently activates PER translation in pacemaker neurons to sustain robust rhythms, revealing a new and important role for translational control in the Drosophila circadian clock.","Lim, Chunghun; Lee, Jongbin; Choi, Changtaek; Kilman, Valerie L.; Kim, Juwon; Park, Sung Mi; Jang, Sung Key; Allada, Ravi; Choe, Joonho","Lim, C; Lee, J; Choi, C; Kilman, VL; Kim, J; Park, SM; Jang, SK; Allada, R; Choe, J",399.0,"[Lim, Chunghun; Kilman, Valerie L.; Allada, Ravi] Northwestern Univ, Dept Neurobiol & Physiol, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Lee, Jongbin; Choi, Changtaek; Kim, Juwon; Choe, Joonho] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Biol Sci, Taejon 305701, South Korea; [Park, Sung Mi; Jang, Sung Key] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Life Sci, Pohang 790784, South Korea",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09728,Article,,r-allada@northwestern.edu; jchoe@kaist.ac.kr,U152,"Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, the Republic of Korea; National Institutes of Health [R01NS059042, R01NS052903, R01MH067870]","We thank I.

17,123,191.0,"The ability to learn new skills and perfect them with practice applies not only to physical skills but also to abstract skills(1), like motor planning or neuroprosthetic actions. Although plasticity in corticostriatal circuits has been implicated in learning physical skills(2-4), it remains unclear if similar circuits or processes are required for abstract skill learning. Here we use a novel behavioural task in rodents to investigate the role of corticostriatal plasticity in abstract skill learning. Rodents learned to control the pitch of an auditory cursor to reach one of two targets by modulating activity in primary motor cortex irrespective of physical movement. Degradation of the relation between action and outcome, as well as sensory-specific devaluation and omission tests, demonstrate that these learned neuroprosthetic actions are intentional and goal-directed, rather than habitual. Striatal neurons change their activity with learning, with more neurons modulating their activity in relation to target-reaching as learning progresses. Concomitantly, strong relations between the activity of neurons in motor cortex and the striatum emerge. Specific deletion of striatal NMDA receptors impairs the development of this corticostriatal plasticity, and disrupts the ability to learn neuroprosthetic skills. These results suggest that corticostriatal plasticity is necessary for abstract skill learning, and that neuroprosthetic movements capitalize on the neural circuitry involved in natural motor learning.","Koralek, Aaron C.; Jin, Xin; Ii, John D.

18,42,382.0,"Bacteriophage lambda has for many years been a model system for understanding mechanisms of gene regulation(1). A 'genetic switch' enables the phage to transition from lysogenic growth to lytic development when triggered by specific environmental conditions. The key component of the switch is the cI repressor, which binds to two sets of three operator sites on the lambda chromosome that are separated by about 2,400 base pairs (bp)(2,3). A hallmark of the lambda system is the pairwise cooperativity of repressor binding(4). In the absence of detailed structural information, it has been difficult to understand fully how repressor molecules establish the cooperativity complex. Here we present the X- ray crystal structure of the intact lambda cI repressor dimer bound to a DNA operator site. The structure of the repressor, determined by multiple isomorphous replacement methods, reveals an unusual overall architecture that allows it to adopt a conformation that appears to facilitate pairwise cooperative binding to adjacent operator sites.","Stayrook, Steven; Jaru-Ampornpan, Peera; Ni, Jenny; Hochschild, Ann; Lewis, Mitchell","Stayrook, S; Jaru-Ampornpan, P; Ni, J; Hochschild, A; Lewis, M",1022.0,"[Stayrook, Steven; Jaru-Ampornpan, Peera; Ni, Jenny; Lewis, Mitchell] Univ Penn, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Philadelphia, PA 19102 USA; [Hochschild, Ann] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Mol Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06831,Article,,lewis@mail.med.upenn.edu,U12,NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM044025],,291PF,,,BACTERIOPHAGE-LAMBDA; LEXA; CLEAVAGE; DOMAIN; CRYSTALLOGRAPHY; RECOGNITION; PROTEIN; DIMERS,7190.0,NATURE,Nature,English,23.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",24-Apr,5.0,LONDON,18432246.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,,"Lewis, M (reprint author), Univ Penn, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Biophys, 37th & Hamilton Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19102 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,49.0,Crystal structure of the lambda repressor and a model for pairwise cooperative operator binding,1.0,10.0,WOS:000255208600045,382.0,452,Multidisciplinary Sciences,49,mitchell,lewis,534.0,345,male,0.99,Gy-X2vgAAAAJ,1,"[0, 1474]",13937844,1,46310693,1,Mitchell Lewis,Mitchell Lewis,1,1

An estimated two billion people suffer these deficiencies(1), causing a loss of 63 million life-years annually(2,3). Most of these people depend on C-3 grains and legumes as their primary dietary source of zinc and iron. Here we report that C-3 grains and legumes have lower concentrations of zinc and iron when grown under field conditions at the elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration predicted for the middle of this century. C-3 crops other than legumes also have lower concentrations of protein, whereas C-4 crops seem to be less affected. Differences between cultivars of a single crop suggest that breeding for decreased sensitivity to atmospheric CO2 concentration could partly address these new challenges to global health.","Myers, Samuel S.; Zanobetti, Antonella; Kloog, Itai; Huybers, Peter; Leakey, Andrew D.

20,115,388.0,"Circulating tumour cells (CTCs) shed into blood from primary cancers include putative precursors that initiate distal metastases(1). Although these cells are extraordinarily rare, they may identify cellular pathways contributing to the blood-borne dissemination of cancer. Here, we adapted a microfluidic device(2) for efficient capture of CTCs from an endogenous mouse pancreatic cancer model(3) and subjected CTCs to single-molecule RNA sequencing(4), identifying Wnt2 as a candidate gene enriched in CTCs. Expression of WNT2 in pancreatic cancer cells suppresses anoikis, enhances anchorage-independent sphere formation, and increases metastatic propensity in vivo. This effect is correlated with fibronectin upregulation and suppressed by inhibition of MAP3K7 (also known as TAK1) kinase. In humans, formation of non-adherent tumour spheres by pancreatic cancer cells is associated with upregulation of multiple WNT genes, and pancreatic CTCs revealed enrichment for WNT signalling in 5 out of 11 cases. Thus, molecular analysis of CTCs may identify candidate therapeutic targets to prevent the distal spread of cancer.","Yu, Min; Ting, David T.; Stott, Shannon L.; Wittner, Ben S.; Ozsolak, Fatih; Paul, Suchismita; Ciciliano, Jordan C.; Smas, Malgorzata E.; Winokur, Daniel; Gilman, Anna J.; Ulman, Matthew J.; Xega, Kristina; Contino, Gianmarco; Alagesan, Brinda; Brannigan, Brian W.; Milos, Patrice M.; Ryan, David P.; Sequist, Lecia V.; Bardeesy, Nabeel; Ramaswamy, Sridhar; Toner, Mehmet; Maheswaran, Shyamala; Haber, Daniel A.","Yu, M; Ting, DT; Stott, SL; Wittner, BS; Ozsolak, F; Paul, S; Ciciliano, JC; Smas, ME; Winokur, D; Gilman, AJ; Ulman, MJ; Xega, K; Contino, G; Alagesan, B; Brannigan, BW; Milos, PM; Ryan, DP; Sequist, LV; Bardeesy, N; Ramaswamy, S; Toner, M; Maheswaran, S; Haber, DA",510.0,"[Yu, Min; Ting, David T.; Stott, Shannon L.; Wittner, Ben S.; Paul, Suchismita; Ciciliano, Jordan C.; Smas, Malgorzata E.; Winokur, Daniel; Gilman, Anna J.; Ulman, Matthew J.; Xega, Kristina; Contino, Gianmarco; Alagesan, Brinda; Brannigan, Brian W.; Ryan, David P.; Sequist, Lecia V.; Bardeesy, Nabeel; Ramaswamy, Sridhar; Toner, Mehmet; Maheswaran, Shyamala; Haber, Daniel A.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Canc, Ctr Engn Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Yu, Min; Ting, David T.; Stott, Shannon L.; Wittner, Ben S.; Paul, Suchismita; Ciciliano, Jordan C.; Smas, Malgorzata E.; Winokur, Daniel; Gilman, Anna J.; Ulman, Matthew J.; Xega, Kristina; Contino, Gianmarco; Alagesan, Brinda; Brannigan, Brian W.; Ryan, David P.; Sequist, Lecia V.; Bardeesy, Nabeel; Ramaswamy, Sridhar; Toner, Mehmet; Maheswaran, Shyamala; Haber, Daniel A.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Yu, Min; Ting, David T.; Stott, Shannon L.; Wittner, Ben S.; Paul, Suchismita; Ciciliano, Jordan C.; Smas, Malgorzata E.; Winokur, Daniel; Gilman, Anna J.; Ulman, Matthew J.; Xega, Kristina; Contino, Gianmarco; Alagesan, Brinda; Brannigan, Brian W.; Ryan, David P.; Sequist, Lecia V.; Bardeesy, Nabeel; Ramaswamy, Sridhar; Toner, Mehmet; Maheswaran, Shyamala; Haber, Daniel A.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Surg, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Yu, Min; Haber, Daniel A.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chevy Chase, MD 20815 USA; [Ozsolak, Fatih; Milos, Patrice M.] Helicos BioSci Corp, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11217,Article,,maheswaran@helix.mgh.harvard.edu; haber@helix.mgh.harvard.edu,U130,Stand Up To Cancer; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NIBIB [5R01EB008047]; NIH [CA129933]; Pancreatic Cancer Action Network - AACR Fellowship; Warshaw Institute for Pancreatic Cancer Research; K12 Paul Calabresi Award for Clinical Oncology Clinical Research Career Development Program NIH [5K12CA87723-09],"We thank C.

21,48,452.0,"Major ice sheets were permanently established on Antarctica approximately 34 million years ago(1-3), close to the Eocene/Oligocene boundary, at the same time as a permanent deepening of the calcite compensation depth in the world's oceans(4). Until recently, it was thought that Northern Hemisphere glaciation began much later, between 11 and 5 million years ago(1-3,5). This view has been challenged, however, by records of ice rafting at high northern latitudes during the Eocene epoch(6,7) and by estimates of global ice volume that exceed the storage capacity of Antarctica(8) at the same time as a temporary deepening of the calcite compensation depth 41.6 million years ago(9). Here we test the hypothesis that large ice sheets were present in both hemispheres 41.6 million years ago using marine sediment records of oxygen and carbon isotope values and of calcium carbonate content from the equatorial Atlantic Ocean. These records allow, at most, an ice budget that can easily be accommodated on Antarctica, indicating that large ice sheets were not present in the Northern Hemisphere. The records also reveal a brief interval shortly before the temporary deepening of the calcite compensation depth during which the calcite compensation depth shoaled, ocean temperatures increased and carbon isotope values decreased in the equatorial Atlantic. The nature of these changes around 41.6 million years ago implies common links, in terms of carbon cycling, with events at the Eocene/Oligocene boundary(4) and with the 'hyperthermals' of the Early Eocene climate optimum(3,10,11). Our findings help to resolve the apparent discrepancy between the geological records of Northern Hemisphere glaciation(6-8) and model results(12,13) that indicate that the threshold for continental glaciation was crossed earlier in the Southern Hemisphere than in the Northern Hemisphere.","Edgar, Kirsty M.; Wilson, Paul A.; Sexton, Philip F.; Suganuma, Yusuke","Edgar, KM; Wilson, PA; Sexton, PF; Suganuma, Y",908.0,"Natl Oceanog Ctr, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England; Univ Tokyo, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06053,Article,,paw1@noc.soton.ac.uk,911,,,202OM,,,ATMOSPHERIC CARBON-DIOXIDE; ICE-SHEET EXPANSION; ANTARCTIC GLACIATION; OLIGOCENE; OCEAN; PALEOCENE; GREENLAND; MAXIMUM; RECORDS,7156.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,"suganuma, yusuke/0000-0003-3516-1317; Edgar, Kirsty/0000-0001-7587-9951","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",23-Aug,4.0,LONDON,17713530.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007.0,"Sexton, Philip/B-2493-2010","Wilson, PA (reprint author), Natl Oceanog Ctr, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci, European Way, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,51.0,No extreme bipolar glaciation during the main Eocene calcite compensation shift,0.0,18.0,WOS:000248912900042,452.0,448,Multidisciplinary Sciences,52,yusuke,suganuma,563.0,28,male,1.0,Jaf7rrYAAAAJ,1,"[0, 1474]",53708210,1,14608977,1,2014 in Antarctica,2014 in Antarctica,0,0
22,88,1.0,"Genomic studies have shown that Neanderthals interbred with modern humans, and that non-Africans today are the products of this mixture(1,2). The antiquity of Neanderthal gene flow into modern humans means that genomic regions that derive from Neanderthals in any one human today are usually less than a hundred kilobases in size. However, Neanderthal haplotypes are also distinctive enough that several studies have been able to detect Neanderthal ancestry at specific loci(1,3-8). We systematically infer Neanderthal haplotypes in the genomes of 1,004 present-day humans(9). Regions that harbour a high frequency of Neanderthal alleles are enriched for genes affecting keratin filaments, suggesting that Neanderthal alleles may have helped modern humans to adapt to non-African environments. We identify multiple Neanderthal-derived alleles that confer risk for disease, suggesting that Neanderthal alleles continue to shape human biology. An unexpected finding is that regions with reduced Neanderthal ancestry are enriched in genes, implying selection to remove genetic material derived from Neanderthals. Genes that are more highly expressed in testes than in any other tissue are especially reduced in Neanderthal ancestry, and there is an approximately fivefold reduction of Neanderthal ancestry on the X chromosome, which is known from studies of diverse species to be especially dense in male hybrid sterility genes(10-12). These results suggest that part of the explanation for genomic regions of reduced Neanderthal ancestry is Neanderthal alleles that caused decreased fertility in males when moved to a modern human genetic background.","Sankararaman, Sriram; Mallick, Swapan; Dannemann, Michael; Pruefer, Kay; Kelso, Janet; Paeaebo, Svante; Patterson, Nick; Reich, David","Sankararaman, S; Mallick, S; Dannemann, M; Prufer, K; Kelso, J; Paabo, S; Patterson, N; Reich, D",354.0,"[Sankararaman, Sriram; Mallick, Swapan; Patterson, Nick; Reich, David] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Sankararaman, Sriram; Mallick, Swapan; Patterson, Nick; Reich, David] Broad Inst Harvard & MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Dannemann, Michael; Pruefer, Kay; Kelso, Janet; Paeaebo, Svante] Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Anthropol, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Reich, David] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12961,Article,1476-4687,sankararaman@genetics.med.harvard.edu; reich@genetics.med.harvard.edu,+,Presidential Innovation Fund of the Max Planck Society; NSF HOMINID [1032255]; NIH [GM100233]; Initiative for the Science of the Human Past at Harvard University,"We thank A.

23,2,260.0,"To establish productive infection, a retrovirus must insert a DNA replica of its genome into host cell chromosomal DNA(1,2). This process is operated by the intasome, a nucleoprotein complex composed of an integrase tetramer (IN) assembled on the viral DNA ends(3,4). The intasome engages chromosomal DNA within a target capture complex to carry out strand transfer, irreversibly joining the viral and cellular DNA molecules. Although several intasome/transpososome structures from the DDE(D) recombinase superfamily have been reported(4-6), the mechanics of target DNA capture and strand transfer by these enzymes remained unclear. Here we report crystal structures of the intasome from prototype foamy virus in complex with target DNA, elucidating the pre-integration target DNA capture and post-catalytic strand transfer intermediates of the retroviral integration process. The cleft between IN dimers within the intasome accommodates chromosomal DNA in a severely bent conformation, allowing widely spaced IN active sites to access the scissile phosphodiester bonds. Our results resolve the structural basis for retroviral DNA integration and provide a framework for the design of INs with altered target sequences.","Maertens, Goedele N.; Hare, Stephen; Cherepanov, Peter","Maertens, GN; Hare, S; Cherepanov, P",326.0,"[Maertens, Goedele N.; Hare, Stephen; Cherepanov, Peter] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Div Infect Dis, London W2 1PG, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09517,Article,1476-4687,p.cherepanov@imperial.ac.uk,U217,UK Medical Research Council,"We thank A.

24,69,473.0,"We generated genome-wide data from 69 Europeans who lived between 8,000-3,000 years ago by enriching ancient DNA libraries for a target set of almost 400,000 polymorphisms. Enrichment of these positions decreases the sequencing required for genome-wide ancient DNA analysis by a median of around 250-fold, allowing us to study an order of magnitude more individuals than previous studies(1-8) and to obtain new insights about the past. We show that the populations of Western and Far Eastern Europe followed opposite trajectories between 8,000-5,000 years ago. At the beginning of the Neolithic period in Europe, similar to 8,000-7,000 years ago, closely related groups of early farmers appeared in Germany, Hungary and Spain, different from indigenous hunter-gatherers, whereas Russia was inhabited by a distinctive population of hunter-gatherers with high affinity to a similar to 24,000-year-old Siberian(6). By similar to 6,000-5,000 years ago, farmers throughout much of Europe had more hunter-gatherer ancestry than their predecessors, but in Russia, the Yamnaya steppe herders of this time were descended not only from the preceding eastern European hunter-gatherers, but also from a population of Near Eastern ancestry. Western and Eastern Europe came into contact similar to 4,500 years ago, as the Late Neolithic Corded Ware people from Germany traced similar to 75% of their ancestry to the Yamnaya, documenting a massive migration into the heartland of Europe from its eastern periphery. This steppe ancestry persisted in all sampled central Europeans until at least similar to 3,000 years ago, and is ubiquitous in present-day Europeans. These results provide support for a steppe origin(9) of at least some of the Indo-European languages of Europe.","Haak, Wolfgang; Lazaridis, Iosif; Patterson, Nick; Rohland, Nadin; Mallick, Swapan; Llamas, Bastien; Brandt, Guido; Nordenfelt, Susanne; Harney, Eadaoin; Stewardson, Kristin; Fu, Qiaomei; Mittnik, Alissa; Banffy, Eszter; Economou, Christos; Francken, Michael; Friederich, Susanne; Pena, Rafael Garrido; Hallgren, Fredrik; Khartanovich, Valery; Khokhlov, Aleksandr; Kunst, Michael; Kuznetsov, Pavel; Meller, Harald; Mochalov, Oleg; Moiseyev, Vayacheslav; Nicklisch, Nicole; Pichler, Sandra L.; Risch, Roberto; Rojo Guerra, Manuel A.; Roth, Christina; Szecsenyi-Nagy, Anna; Wahl, Joachim; Meyer, Matthias; Krause, Johannes; Brown, Dorcas; Anthony, David; Cooper, Alan; Alt, Kurt Werner; Reich, David","Haak, W; Lazaridis, I; Patterson, N; Rohland, N; Mallick, S; Llamas, B; Brandt, G; Nordenfelt, S; Harney, E; Stewardson, K; Fu, QM; Mittnik, A; Banffy, E; Economou, C; Francken, M; Friederich, S; Pena, RG; Hallgren, F; Khartanovich, V; Khokhlov, A; Kunst, M; Kuznetsov, P; Meller, H; Mochalov, O; Moiseyev, V; Nicklisch, N; Pichler, SL; Risch, R; Guerra, MAR; Roth, C; Szecsenyi-Nagy, A; Wahl, J; Meyer, M; Krause, J; Brown, D; Anthony, D; Cooper, A; Alt, KW; Reich, D",207.0,"[Haak, Wolfgang; Llamas, Bastien; Cooper, Alan] Univ Adelaide, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Australian Ctr Ancient DNA, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Haak, Wolfgang; Llamas, Bastien; Cooper, Alan] Univ Adelaide, Inst Environm, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Lazaridis, Iosif; Rohland, Nadin; Mallick, Swapan; Nordenfelt, Susanne; Harney, Eadaoin; Stewardson, Kristin; Fu, Qiaomei; Reich, David] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Lazaridis, Iosif; Patterson, Nick; Rohland, Nadin; Mallick, Swapan; Nordenfelt, Susanne; Harney, Eadaoin; Stewardson, Kristin; Fu, Qiaomei; Reich, David] Broad Inst Harvard & MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Mallick, Swapan; Harney, Eadaoin; Stewardson, Kristin; Reich, David] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Brandt, Guido; Nicklisch, Nicole; Roth, Christina; Szecsenyi-Nagy, Anna; Alt, Kurt Werner] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Anthropol, D-55128 Mainz, Germany; [Fu, Qiaomei; Meyer, Matthias] Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Anthropol, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Fu, Qiaomei] Chinese Acad Sci, IVPP, Key Lab Vertebrate Evolut & Human Origins, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Mittnik, Alissa; Krause, Johannes] Univ Tubingen, Inst Archaeol Sci, D-72070 Tubingen, Germany; [Banffy, Eszter; Szecsenyi-Nagy, Anna] Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Archaeol, Res Ctr Humanities, H-1014 Budapest, Hungary; [Banffy, Eszter] RGK, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany; [Economou, Christos] Stockholm Univ, Archaeol Res Lab, S-11418 Stockholm, Sweden; [Francken, Michael; Krause, Johannes] Univ Tubingen, Senckenberg Ctr Human Evolut & Paleoenvironm, Dept Paleoanthropol, D-72070 Tubingen, Germany; [Francken, Michael; Krause, Johannes] Univ Tubingen, Senckenberg Ctr Human Evolut & Paleoenvironm, Dept Archaeogenet, D-72070 Tubingen, Germany; [Friederich, Susanne; Meller, Harald; Nicklisch, Nicole; Alt, Kurt Werner] Saxony Anhalt & State Museum Prehist, State Off Heritage Management & Archaeol, D-06114 Halle, Germany; [Pena, Rafael Garrido] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Fac Filosofia & Letras, Dept Prehist & Arqueol, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Hallgren, Fredrik] Cultural Heritage Fdn, S-72212 Vasteras, Sweden; [Khartanovich, Valery; Moiseyev, Vayacheslav] Peter Great Museum Anthropol & Ethnog Kunstkamera, St Petersburg 199034, Russia; [Khokhlov, Aleksandr; Kuznetsov, Pavel; Mochalov, Oleg] Volga State Acad Social Sci & Humanities, Samara 443099, Russia; [Kunst, Michael] Deutsch Archaeol Inst, Abt Madrid, E-28002 Madrid, Spain; [Nicklisch, Nicole; Alt, Kurt Werner] Danube Private Univ, A-3500 Krems, Austria; [Pichler, Sandra L.; Alt, Kurt Werner] Univ Basel, Inst Prehist & Archaeol Sci, CH-4003 Basel, Switzerland; [Risch, Roberto] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Prehist, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Rojo Guerra, Manuel A.] Univ Valladolid, Dept Prehist & Arqueol, E-47002 Valladolid, Spain; [Wahl, Joachim] State Off Cultural Heritage Management Baden Wurt, D-78467 Constance, Germany; [Krause, Johannes] Max Planck Inst Sci Human Hist, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Brown, Dorcas; Anthony, David] Hartwick Coll, Dept Anthropol, Oneonta, NY 13820 USA",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14317,Article,1476-4687,reich@genetics.med.harvard.edu,+,"Australian Research Council [DP130102158]; German Research Foundation [Al 287/7-1, 7-3, Al 287/10-1, Al 287/14-1, Me 3245/1-1, 1-3]; US National Science Foundation HOMINID grant [BCS-1032255]; US National Institutes of Health [GM100233]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute","We thank P.

25,21,187.0,"Despite decades of research, the identity of the cells generating the first haematopoietic cells in mammalian embryos is unknown(1). Indeed, whether blood cells arise from mesodermal cells, mesenchymal progenitors, bipotent endothelial - haematopoietic precursors or haemogenic endothelial cells remains controversial(2-9). Proximity of endothelial and blood cells at sites of embryonic haematopoiesis, as well as their similar gene expression, led to the hypothesis of the endothelium generating blood. However, owing to lacking technology(10) it has been impossible to observe blood cell emergence continuously at the single- cell level, and the postulated existence of haemogenic endothelial cells remains disputed(1). Here, using new imaging and cell- tracking methods, we show that embryonic endothelial cells can be haemogenic. By continuous long- term single- cell observation of mouse mesodermal cells generating endothelial cell and blood colonies, it was possible to detect haemogenic endothelial cells giving rise to blood cells. Living endothelial and haematopoietic cells were identified by simultaneous detection of morphology and multiple molecular and functional markers. Detachment of nascent blood cells from endothelium is not directly linked to asymmetric cell division, and haemogenic endothelial cells are specified from cells already expressing endothelial markers. These results improve our understanding of the developmental origin of mammalian blood and the potential generation of haematopoietic stem cells from embryonic stem cells.","Eilken, Hanna M.; Nishikawa, Shin-Ichi; Schroeder, Timm","Eilken, HM; Nishikawa, SI; Schroeder, T",896.0,"[Eilken, Hanna M.; Schroeder, Timm] Helmholtz Ctr Munich, German Res Ctr Environm Hlth GmbH, Inst Stem Cell Res, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany; [Nishikawa, Shin-Ichi] RIKEN, Ctr Dev Biol, Lab Stem Cell Biol, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07760,Article,,timm.schroeder@helmholtz-muenchen.de,900,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Leading Project for the Realization of Regenerative Medicine,"We are grateful to S.

26,84,338.0,"The evolution of serially arranged, jointed endoskeletal supports internal to the gills-the visceral branchial arches-represents one of the key events in early jawed vertebrate (gnathostome) history, because it provided the morphological basis for the subsequent evolution of jaws. However, until now little was known about visceral arches in early gnathostomes, and theories about gill arch evolution were driven by information gleaned mostly from both modern cartilaginous (chondrichthyan) and bony (osteichthyan) fishes. New fossil discoveries can profoundly affect our understanding of evolutionary history, by revealing hitherto unseen combinations of primitive and derived characters. Here we describe a 325 million year (Myr)-old Palaeozoic shark-like fossil that represents, to our knowledge, the earliest identified chondrichthyan in which the complete gill skeleton is three-dimensionally preserved in its natural position. Its visceral arch arrangement is remarkably osteichthyan-like, suggesting that this may represent the common ancestral condition for crown gnathostomes. Our findings thus reinterpret the polarity of some arch features of the crown jawed vertebrates and invert the classic hypothesis, in which modern sharks retain the ancestral condition. This study underscores the importance of early chondrichthyans in resolving the evolutionary history of jawed vertebrates.","Pradel, Alan; Maisey, John G.; Tafforeau, Paul; Mapes, Royal H.; Mallatt, Jon","Pradel, A; Maisey, JG; Tafforeau, P; Mapes, RH; Mallatt, J",608.0,"[Pradel, Alan; Maisey, John G.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Dept Vertebrate Paleontol, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Tafforeau, Paul] European Synchrotron Radiat Facil, F-38043 Grenoble, France; [Mapes, Royal H.] Ohio Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Athens, OH 45701 USA; [Mallatt, Jon] Washington State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13195,Article,1476-4687,apradel@amnh.org; maisey@amnh.org,+,H.

27,78,157.0,"During glacial periods of the Late Pleistocene, an abundance of proxy data demonstrates the existence of large and repeated millennial-scale warming episodes, known as Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events(1). This ubiquitous feature of rapid glacial climate change can be extended back as far as 800,000 years before present (BP) in the ice core record(2), and has drawn broad attention within the science and policy-making communities alike(3). Many studies have been dedicated to investigating the underlying causes of these changes, but no coherent mechanism has yet been identified(3-15). Here we show, by using a comprehensive fully coupled model(16), that gradual changes in the height of the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets (NHISs) canalter the coupled atmosphere ocean system and cause rapid glacial climate shifts closely resembling DO events. The simulated global climate responses-including abrupt warming in the North Atlantic, a northward shift of the tropical rain-belts, and Southern Hemisphere cooling related to the bipolar seesa ware generally consistent with empirical evidence(1,3,17). As a result of the coexistence of two glacial ocean circulation states at intermediate heights of the ice sheets, minor changes in the height of the NHISs and the amount of atmospheric CO2 can trigger the rapid climate transitions via a local positive atmosphere-ocean-sea-ice feedback in the North Atlantic. Our results, although based on a single model, thus provide a coherent concept for understanding the recorded millennial scale variability and abrupt climate changes in the coupled atmosphere ocean system, as well as their linkages to the volume of the intermediate ice sheets during glacials.","Zhang, Xu; Lohmann, Gerrit; Knorr, Gregor; Purcell, Conor","Zhang, X; Lohmann, G; Knorr, G; Purcell, C",290.0,"[Zhang, Xu; Lohmann, Gerrit; Knorr, Gregor; Purcell, Conor] Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Alfred Wegener Inst, D-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany; [Lohmann, Gerrit] Univ Bremen, MARUM Ctr Marine Environm Sci, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Knorr, Gregor; Purcell, Conor] Cardiff Univ, Sch Earth & Ocean Sci, Cardiff CF10 3AT, S Glam, Wales",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13592,Article,1476-4687,xu.zhang@awi.de,+,"Polar Regions and Coasts in the Changing Earth System (PACES) programme of the AWI; 'Helmholtz Climate Initiative REKLIM' (Regional Climate Change), a joint research project of the Helmholtz Association of German research centres (HGF)","We thank the colleagues in the Paleoclimate Dynamics group at the Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI) in Bremerhaven for useful discussions, and I.

28,63,324.0,"mu-Opioid receptors (mu ORs) are G-protein-coupled receptors that are activated by a structurally diverse spectrum of natural and synthetic agonists including endogenous endorphin peptides, morphine and methadone. The recent structures of the mu OR in inactive(1) and agonist-induced active states (Huang et al., ref. 2) provide snapshots of the receptor at the beginning and end of a signalling event, but little is known about the dynamic sequence of events that span these two states. Here we use solution-state NMR to examine the process of mu OR activation using a purified receptor (mouse sequence) preparation in an amphiphile membrane-like environment. We obtain spectra of the mu OR in the absence of ligand, and in the presence of the high-affinity agonist BU72 alone, or with BU72 and a G protein mimetic nanobody. Our results show that conformational changes in transmembrane segments 5 and 6 (TM5 and TM6), which are required for the full engagement of a G protein, are almost completely dependent on the presence of both the agonist and the G protein mimetic nanobody, revealing a weak allosteric coupling between the agonist-binding pocket and the G-protein-coupling interface (TM5 and TM6), similar to that observed for the beta 2-adrenergic receptor(3). Unexpectedly, in the presence of agonist alone, we find larger spectral changes involving intracellular loop 1 and helix 8 compared to changes in TM5 and TM6. These results suggest that one or both of these domains may play a role in the initial interaction with the G protein, and that TM5 and TM6 are only engaged later in the process of complex formation. The initial interactions between the G protein and intracellular loop 1 and/or helix 8 may be involved in G-protein coupling specificity, as has been suggested for other family A G-protein-coupled receptors.","Sounier, Remy; Mas, Camille; Steyaert, Jan; Laeremans, Toon; Manglik, Aashish; Huang, Weijiao; Kobilka, Brian K.; Demene, Helene; Granier, Sebastien","Sounier, R; Mas, C; Steyaert, J; Laeremans, T; Manglik, A; Huang, WJ; Kobilka, BK; Demene, H; Granier, S",375.0,"[Sounier, Remy; Mas, Camille; Granier, Sebastien] Univ Montpellier, Inst Genom Fonct, CNRS, INSERM,U1191,UMR 5203, F-34000 Montpellier, France; [Steyaert, Jan; Laeremans, Toon] Vrije Univ Brussel, Struct Biol Brussels, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Steyaert, Jan; Laeremans, Toon] VIB, Struct Biol Res Ctr, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Manglik, Aashish; Huang, Weijiao; Kobilka, Brian K.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Physiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Demene, Helene] Univ Montpellier, Ctr Biochim Struct, CNRS, INSERM 1054,UMR 5048, F-34090 Montpellier, France",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14680,Article,1476-4687,helene@cbs.cnrs.fr; sebastien.granier@igf.cnrs.fr,+,INSERM; CNRS; National Institutes of Health [NIDA-DA036246],We acknowledge support from INSERM (S.G.) and CNRS (H.D.) and from the National Institutes of Health Grant (NIDA-DA036246 to B.K.K. and S.G.).

29,66,350.0,"Soils of the northern high latitudes store carbon over millennial timescales (thousands of years) and contain approximately double the carbon stock of the atmosphere(1-3). Warming and associated permafrost thaw can expose soil organic carbon and result in mineralization and carbon dioxide (CO2) release(4-6). However, some of this soil organic carbon may be eroded and transferred to rivers(7-9). If it escapes degradation during river transport and is buried in marine sediments, then it can contribute to a longer-term (more than ten thousand years), geological CO2 sink(8-10). Despite this recognition, the erosional flux and fate of particulate organic carbon (POC) in large rivers at high latitudes remains poorly constrained. Here, we quantify the source of POC in the Mackenzie River, the main sediment supplier to the Arctic Ocean(11,12), and assess its flux and fate. We combine measurements of radiocarbon, stable carbon isotopes and element ratios to correct for rock-derived POC10,13,14. Our samples reveal that the eroded biospheric POC has resided in the basin for millennia, with a mean radiocarbon age of 5,800 +/- 800 years, much older than the POC in large tropical rivers(13,14). From the measured biospheric POC content and variability in annual sediment yield(15), we calculate a biospheric POC flux of 2.2(-0.9)(+1.3) teragrams of carbon per year from the Mackenzie River, which is three times the CO2 drawdown by silicate weathering in this basin(16). Offshore, we find evidence for efficient terrestrial organic carbon burial over the Holocene period, suggesting that erosion of organic carbon-rich, high-latitude soils may result in an important geological CO2 sink.","Hilton, Robert G.; Galy, Valier; Gaillardet, Jerome; Dellinger, Mathieu; Bryant, Charlotte; O'Regan, Matt; Groecke, Darren R.; Coxall, Helen; Bouchez, Julien; Calmels, Damien","Hilton, RG; Galy, V; Gaillardet, J; Dellinger, M; Bryant, C; O'Regan, M; Grocke, DR; Coxall, H; Bouchez, J; Calmels, D",84.0,"[Hilton, Robert G.] Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Durham DH1 3LE, England; [Galy, Valier] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Marine Chem & Geochem, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Gaillardet, Jerome; Dellinger, Mathieu; Bouchez, Julien] Univ Paris Diderot, Inst Phys Globe Paris, Sorbonne Paris Cite, UMR CNRS 7154, F-75005 Paris, France; [Bryant, Charlotte] NERC Radiocarbon Facil, E Kilbride G75 OQF, Lanark, Scotland; [O'Regan, Matt; Coxall, Helen] Stockholm Univ, Dept Geol Sci, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Groecke, Darren R.] Univ Durham, Dept Earth Sci, Durham DH1 3LE, England; [Calmels, Damien] Univ Paris 11, Lab GEOPS, UMR CNRS 8148, F-91405 Orsay, France",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14653,Article,1476-4687,r.g.hilton@durham.ac.uk,U162,"Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), UK [1611.0312]; CNRS (OXYMORE); CNRS (CANNIBALT); Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Arctic Research Initiative; Early Career Research Grant by the British Society for Geomorphology; US National Science Foundation [OCE-0928582]; Royal Society University Fellowship","Radiocarbon measurements were funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), UK (Allocation 1611.0312) to R.G.H and C.B.

30,23,209.0,"Near- infrared observations of more than a dozen 'hot-Jupiter' extrasolar planets have now been reported(1-5). These planets display a wide diversity of properties, yet all are believed to have had their spin periods tidally spin- synchronized with their orbital periods, resulting in permanent star- facing hemispheres and surface flow patterns that are most likely in equilibrium. Planets in significantly eccentric orbits can enable direct measurements of global heating that are largely independent of the details of the hydrodynamic flow(6). Here we report 8-mu m photometric observations of the planet HD 80606b during a 30- hour interval bracketing the periastron passage of its extremely eccentric 111.4- day orbit. As the planet received its strongest irradiation ( 828 times larger than the flux received at apastron) its maximum 8- mm brightness temperature increased from 800 K to 1,500K over a six- hour period. We also detected a secondary eclipse for the planet, which implies an orbital inclination of i approximate to 90 degrees, fixes the planetary mass at four times the mass of Jupiter, and constrains the planet's tidal luminosity. Our measurement of the global heating rate indicates that the radiative time constant at the planet's 8- mu m photosphere is similar to 4.5 h, in comparison with 3 - 5 days in Earth's stratosphere(7).","Laughlin, Gregory; Deming, Drake; Langton, Jonathan; Kasen, Daniel; Vogt, Steve; Butler, Robert Paul; Rivera, Eugenio; Meschiari, Stefano","Laughlin, G; Deming, D; Langton, J; Kasen, D; Vogt, S; Butler, RP; Rivera, E; Meschiari, S",562.0,"[Laughlin, Gregory; Langton, Jonathan; Kasen, Daniel; Vogt, Steve; Rivera, Eugenio; Meschiari, Stefano] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Univ Calif Observ, Lick Observ, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Deming, Drake] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Planetary Syst Branch, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Butler, Robert Paul] Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Terr Magnetism, Washington, DC 20015 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07649,Article,1476-4687,laughlin@ucolick.org,564,NASA,"We thank P.

31,125,469.0,"High He-3/He-4 ratios in some basalts have generally been interpreted as originating in an incompletely degassed lower-mantle source(1-9). This helium source may have been isolated at the core-mantle boundary region since Earth's accretion(4-6). Alternatively, it may have taken part in whole-mantle convection and crust production over the age of the Earth(7-9); if so, it is now either a primitive refugium at the core-mantle boundary(8) or is distributed throughout the lower mantle(7,9). Here we constrain the problem using lavas from Baffin Island, West Greenland, the Ontong Java Plateau, Isla Gorgona and Fernandina (Galapagos). Olivine phenocryst compositions show that these lavas originated from a peridotite source that was about 20 per cent higher in nickel content than in the modern mid-ocean-ridge basalt source. Where data are available, these lavas also have high He-3/He-4. We propose that a less-degassed nickel-rich source formed by core-mantle interaction during the crystallization of a melt-rich layer or basal magma ocean(5,6), and that this source continues to be sampled by mantle plumes. The spatial distribution of this source may be constrained by nickel partitioning experiments at the pressures of the core-mantle boundary.","Herzberg, Claude; Asimow, Paul D.; Ionov, Dmitri A.; Vidito, Chris; Jackson, Matthew G.; Geist, Dennis","Herzberg, C; Asimow, PD; Ionov, DA; Vidito, C; Jackson, MG; Geist, D",393.0,"[Herzberg, Claude; Vidito, Chris] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; [Asimow, Paul D.] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Ionov, Dmitri A.] Univ St Etienne, Dept Geol, F-42023 St Etienne 2, France; [Ionov, Dmitri A.] CNRS, UMR 6524, Lab Magmas & Volcans, F-42023 St Etienne, France; [Jackson, Matthew G.] Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Geist, Dennis] Univ Idaho, Dept Geol Sci, Moscow, ID 83844 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11771,Article,1476-4687,herzberg@rci.rutgers.edu,U134,"French INSU-CNRS; NSF [EAR-1119522, EAR1145271]","C.H. thanks L.

32,133,222.0,"Pregnancy is an intricately orchestrated process where immune effector cells with fetal specificity are selectively silenced. This requires the sustained expansion of immune-suppressive maternal FOXP3(+) regulatory T cells (T-reg cells), because even transient partial ablation triggers fetal-specific effector T-cell activation and pregnancy loss(1,2). In turn, many idiopathic pregnancy complications proposed to originate from disrupted fetal tolerance are associated with blunted maternal T-reg expansion(3-5). Importantly, however, the antigen specificity and cellular origin of maternal Treg cells that accumulate during gestation remain incompletely defined. Here we show that pregnancy selectively stimulates the accumulation of maternal FOXP3(+) CD4 cells with fetal specificity using tetramer-based enrichment that allows the identification of rare endogenous T cells(6). Interestingly, after delivery, fetal-specific T-reg cells persist at elevated levels, maintain tolerance to pre-existing fetal antigen, and rapidly re-accumulate during subsequent pregnancy. The accelerated expansion of T-reg cells during secondary pregnancy was driven almost exclusively by proliferation of fetal-specific FOXP3(+) cells retained from prior pregnancy, whereas induced FOXP3 expression and proliferation of pre-existing FOXP3(+) cells each contribute to T-reg expansion during primary pregnancy. Furthermore, fetal resorption in secondary compared with primary pregnancy becomes more resilient to partial maternal FOXP3(+) cell ablation. Thus, pregnancy imprints FOXP3(+) CD4 cells that sustain protective regulatory memory to fetal antigen. We anticipate that these findings will spark further investigation on maternal regulatory T-cell specificity that unlocks new strategies for improving pregnancy outcomes and novel approaches for therapeutically exploiting T-reg cell memory.","Rowe, Jared H.; Ertelt, James M.; Xin, Lijun; Way, Sing Sing","Rowe, JH; Ertelt, JM; Xin, LJ; Way, SS",102.0,"[Rowe, Jared H.; Ertelt, James M.; Xin, Lijun; Way, Sing Sing] Univ Minnesota, Sch Med, Ctr Infect Dis & Microbiol Translat Res, Ctr Immunol,Dept Pediat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Rowe, Jared H.; Ertelt, James M.; Xin, Lijun; Way, Sing Sing] Univ Minnesota, Sch Med, Ctr Infect Dis & Microbiol Translat Res, Ctr Immunol,Dept Microbiol, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11462,Article,,singsing.way@cchmc.org,U119,"NIH-NIAID [R01AI087830, R01AI100934]; NIH-NIDDK [F30DK084674]; Burroughs Wellcome Fund","We thank M.

33,3,194.0,"The chemotaxis signalling network in Escherichia coli that controls the locomotion of bacteria is a classic model system for signal transduction(1,2). This pathway modulates the behaviour of flagellar motors to propel bacteria towards sources of chemical attractants. Although this system relaxes to a steady state in response to environmental changes, the signalling events within the chemotaxis network are noisy and cause large temporal variations of the motor behaviour even in the absence of stimulus(3). That the same signalling network governs both behavioural variability and cellular response raises the question of whether these two traits are independent. Here, we experimentally establish a fluctuation-response relationship in the chemotaxis system of living bacteria. Using this relationship, we demonstrate the possibility of inferring the cellular response from the behavioural variability measured before stimulus. In monitoring the pre- and post-stimulus switching behaviour of individual bacterial motors, we found that variability scales linearly with the response time for different functioning states of the cell. This study highlights that the fundamental relationship between fluctuation and response is not constrained to physical systems at thermodynamic equilibrium(4) but is extensible to living cells(5). Such a relationship not only implies that behavioural variability and cellular response can be coupled traits, but it also provides a general framework within which we can examine how the selection of a network design shapes this interdependence.","Park, Heungwon; Pontius, William; Guet, Calin C.; Marko, John F.; Emonet, Thierry; Cluzel, Philippe","Park, H; Pontius, W; Guet, CC; Marko, JF; Emonet, T; Cluzel, P",819.0,"[Guet, Calin C.; Cluzel, Philippe] Harvard Univ, FAS Ctr Syst Biol, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Guet, Calin C.; Cluzel, Philippe] Harvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Park, Heungwon] Univ Chicago, James Franck Inst, Inst Biophys Dynam, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Park, Heungwon] Univ Chicago, Dept Phys, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Pontius, William; Emonet, Thierry] Yale Univ, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Pontius, William; Emonet, Thierry] Yale Univ, Dept Phys, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Marko, John F.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Mol Biosci, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Marko, John F.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09551,Article,,cluzel@mcb.harvard.edu,U114,"NSF DMR [0213745]; NIH [R01AI059195-03, 1U54CA143869-01]; NSF [CCF0829836, PHY-0852130, DMR-0715099]; Alfred P.

34,64,27.0,"Radiative transfer of energy at the nanometre length scale is of great importance to a variety of technologies including heat-assisted magnetic recording(1), near-field thermophotovoltaics(2) and lithography(3). Although experimental advances have enabled elucidation of near-field radiative heat transfer in gaps as small as 20-30 nanometres (refs 4-6), quantitative analysis in the extreme near field (less than 10 nanometres) has been greatly limited by experimental challenges. Moreover, the results of pioneering measurements(7,8) differed from theoretical predictions by orders of magnitude. Here we use custom-fabricated scanning probes with embedded thermocouples(9,10), in conjunction with new microdevices capable of periodic temperature modulation, to measure radiative heat transfer down to gaps as small as two nanometres. For our experiments we deposited suitably chosen metal or dielectric layers on the scanning probes and microdevices, enabling direct study of extreme near-field radiation between silica-silica, silicon nitride-silicon nitride and gold-gold surfaces to reveal marked, gap-size-dependent enhancements of radiative heat transfer. Furthermore, our state-of-the-art calculations of radiative heat transfer, performed within the theoretical framework of fluctuational electrodynamics, are in excellent agreement with our experimental results, providing unambiguous evidence that confirms the validity of this theory(11-13) for modelling radiative heat transfer in gaps as small as a few nanometres.

35,99,475.0,"The impact of nutritional status during fetal life on the overall health of adults has been recognized(1); however, dietary effects on the developing immune system are largely unknown. Development of secondary lymphoid organs occurs during embryogenesis and is considered to be developmentally programmed(2,3). Secondary lymphoid organ formation depends on a subset of type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) named lymphoid tissue inducer(LTi) cells(2-5). Here we show that mouse fetal ILC3s are controlled by cell-autonomous retinoic acid (RA) signalling in utero, which pre-sets the immune fitness in adulthood. We found that embryonic lymphoid organs contain ILC progenitors that differentiate locally into mature LTi cells. Local LTi cell differentiation was controlled by maternal retinoid intake and fetal RA signalling acting in a haematopoietic cell-autonomous manner. RA controlled LTi cell maturation upstream of the transcription factor ROR gamma t. Accordingly, enforced expression of Rorgt restored maturation of LTi cells with impaired RA signalling, whereas RA receptors directly regulated the Rorgt locus. Finally, we established that maternal levels of dietary retinoids control the size of secondary lymphoid organs and the efficiency of immune responses in the adult offspring. Our results reveal a molecular link between maternal nutrients and the formation of immune structures required for resistance to infection in the offspring.","van de Pavert, Serge A.; Ferreira, Manuela; Domingues, Rita G.; Ribeiro, Helder; Molenaar, Rosalie; Moreira-Santos, Lara; Almeida, Francisca F.; Ibiza, Sales; Barbosa, Ines; Goverse, Gera; Labao-Almeida, Carlos; Godinho-Silva, Cristina; Konijn, Tanja; Schooneman, Dennis; O'Toole, Tom; Mizee, Mark R.; Habani, Yasmin; Haak, Esther; Santori, Fabio R.; Littman, Dan R.; Schulte-Merker, Stefan; Dzierzak, Elaine; Simas, J.

36,50,156.0,"The world's greatest terrestrial stores of biodiversity and carbon are found in the forests of northern South America, where large-scale biogeographic patterns and processes have recently begun to be described(1-4). Seven of the nine countries with territory in the Amazon basin and the Guiana shield have carried out large-scale forest inventories, but such massive data sets have been little exploited by tropical plant ecologists(5-8). Although forest inventories often lack the species-level identifications favoured by tropical plant ecologists, their consistency of measurement and vast spatial coverage make them ideally suited for numerical analyses at large scales, and a valuable resource to describe the still poorly understood spatial variation of biomass, diversity, community composition and forest functioning across the South American tropics(9). Here we show, by using the seven forest inventories complemented with trait and inventory data collected elsewhere, two dominant gradients in tree composition and function across the Amazon, one paralleling a major gradient in soil fertility and the other paralleling a gradient in dry season length. The data set also indicates that the dominance of Fabaceae in the Guiana shield is not necessarily the result of root adaptations to poor soils ( nodulation or ectomycorrhizal associations) but perhaps also the result of their remarkably high seed mass there as a potential adaptation to low rates of disturbance.","ter Steege, Hans; Pitman, Nigel C.

37,9,42.0,"The modern giant sperm whale Physeter macrocephalus, one of the largest known predators, preys upon cephalopods at great depths(1,2). Lacking a functional upper dentition, it relies on suction for catching its prey(3); in contrast, several smaller Miocene sperm whales (Physeteroidea) have been interpreted as raptorial (versus suction) feeders(4,5), analogous to the modern killer whale Orcinus orca. Whereas very large physeteroid teeth have been discovered in various Miocene localities, associated diagnostic cranial remains have not been found so far(6-8). Here we report the discovery of a new giant sperm whale from the Middle Miocene of Peru (approximately 12-13 million years ago), Leviathan melvillei, described on the basis of a skull with teeth and mandible. With a 3-m-long head, very large upper and lower teeth (maximum diameter and length of 12 cm and greater than 36 cm, respectively), robust jaws and a temporal fossa considerably larger than in Physeter, this stem physeteroid represents one of the largest raptorial predators and, to our knowledge, the biggest tetrapod bite ever found. The appearance of gigantic raptorial sperm whales in the fossil record coincides with a phase of diversification and size-range increase of the baleen-bearing mysticetes in the Miocene. We propose that Leviathan fed mostly on high-energy content medium-size baleen whales. As a top predator, together with the contemporaneous giant shark Carcharocles megalodon, it probably had a profound impact on the structuring of Miocene marine communities. The development of a vast supracranial basin in Leviathan, extending on the rostrum as in Physeter, might indicate the presence of an enlarged spermaceti organ in the former that is not associated with deep diving or obligatory suction feeding.","Lambert, Olivier; Bianucci, Giovanni; Post, Klaas; de Muizon, Christian; Salas-Gismondi, Rodolfo; Urbina, Mario; Reumer, Jelle","Lambert, O; Bianucci, G; Post, K; de Muizon, C; Salas-Gismondi, R; Urbina, M; Reumer, J",105.0,"[Lambert, Olivier] Inst Royal Sci Nat Belgique, Dept Paleontol, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [Bianucci, Giovanni] Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Sci Terra, I-56126 Pisa, Italy; [Post, Klaas; Reumer, Jelle] Nat Hist Museum Rotterdam, NL-3001 KL Rotterdam, Netherlands; [de Muizon, Christian] Museum Natl Hist Nat, Dept Hist Terre, F-75005 Paris, France; [Salas-Gismondi, Rodolfo; Urbina, Mario] Univ Nacl Mayor San Marcos, Museo Hist Nat, Lima 14, Peru; [Reumer, Jelle] Univ Utrecht, Dept Geosci, NL-3508 TA Utrecht, Netherlands",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09067,Article,,olambert@mnhn.fr; bianucci@dst.unipi.it,108,Board of the Natuurhistorisch Museum Rotterdam Foundation; Belgian Federal Science Policy Office,"We thank W.

38,23,36.0,"Very massive stars shed much of their mass in violent precursor eruptions(1) as luminous blue variables(2) ( LBVs) before reaching their most likely end as supernovae, but the cause of LBV eruptions is unknown. The nineteenth- century eruption of eta Carinae, the prototype of these events(3), ejected about 12 solar masses at speeds of 650 km s(-1), with a kinetic energy of almost 10(50) erg ( ref. 4). Some faster material with speeds up to 1,000 2,000 km s(-1) had previously been reported(5-8) but its full distribution was unknown. Here I report observations of much faster material with speeds up to 3,500-6,000 km s(-1), reaching farther from the star than the fastest material in previous reports(5). This fast material roughly doubles the kinetic energy of the nineteenth-century event and suggests that it released a blast wave now propagating ahead of the massive ejecta. As a result, eta Carinae's outer shell now mimics a low- energy supernova remnant. The eruption has usually been discussed in terms of an extreme wind driven by the star's luminosity(2,3,9,10), but the fast material reported here indicates that it may have been powered by a deep- seated explosion rivalling a supernova, perhaps triggered by the pulsational pair instability(11). This may alter interpretations of similar events seen in other galaxies.","Smith, Nathan","Smith, N",201.0,"[Smith, Nathan] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Astron, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07269,Article,,nathans@astro.berkeley.edu,203,,,346SZ,,,HOMUNCULUS-NEBULA; POPULATION-III; HIGH-VELOCITY; MASSIVE STAR; OUTER SHELL; SPECTROSCOPY; DISCOVERY; EMISSION; ANALOG; SHAPE,7210.0,NATURE,Nature,English,29.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",11-Sep,3.0,LONDON,18784719.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,,"Smith, N (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Astron, 601 Campbell Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,51.0,A blast wave from the 1843 eruption of eta Carinae,0.0,2.0,WOS:000259090800041,36.0,455,Multidisciplinary Sciences,51,nathan,smith,1657.0,1632,male,1.0,a8aBqP8AAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
39,82,70.0,"To repair double-strand DNA breaks by homologous recombination, the 5'-terminated DNA strand must first be resected, which generates 3' single-stranded DNA overhangs. Genetic evidence suggests that this process is initiated by the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 (MRX) complex(1-3). However, its involvement was puzzling, as the complex possesses exonuclease activity with the opposite (3' to 5') polarity from that required for homologous recombination(4,5). Consequently, a bidirectional model has been proposed(6-8) whereby dsDNA is first incised endonucleolytically and MRX then proceeds back to the dsDNA end using its 3' to 5' exonuclease. The endonuclease creates entry sites for Sgs1-Dna2 and/or Exo1, which then carry out long-range resection in the 5' to 3' direction. However, the identity of the endonuclease remained unclear. Using purified Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins, we show that Sae2 promotes dsDNA-specific endonuclease activity by the Mre11 subunit within the MRX complex. The endonuclease preferentially cleaves the 5'-terminated dsDNA strand, which explains the polarity paradox. The dsDNA end clipping is strongly stimulated by protein blocks at the DNA end, and requires the ATPase activity ofRad50 and physical interactions between MRX and Sae2. Our results suggest that MRX initiates dsDNA break processing by dsDNA endonuclease rather than exonuclease activity, and that Sae2 is the key regulator of this process. These findings demonstrate a probable mechanism for the initiation of dsDNA break processing in both vegetative and meiotic cells.","Cannavo, Elda; Cejka, Petr","Cannavo, E; Cejka, P",122.0,"[Cannavo, Elda; Cejka, Petr] Univ Zurich, Inst Mol Canc Res, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13771,Article,1476-4687,cejka@imcr.uzh.ch,+,Swiss National Science Foundation [PP00P3 133636],"We thank L.

40,68,183.0,"The factors shaping cometary nuclei are still largely unknown, but could be the result of concurrent effects of evolutionary(1,2) and primordial processes(3,4). The peculiar bilobed shape of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko may be the result of the fusion of two objects that were once separate or the result of a localized excavation by outgassing at the interface between the two lobes(5). Here we report that the comet's major lobe is enveloped by a nearly continuous set of strata, up to 650 metres thick, which are independent of an analogous stratified envelope on the minor lobe. Gravity vectors computed for the two lobes separately are closer to perpendicular to the strata than those calculated for the entire nucleus and adjacent to the neck separating the two lobes. Therefore comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is an accreted body of two distinct objects with 'onion-like' stratification, which formed before they merged. We conclude that gentle, low-velocity collisions occurred between two fully formed kilometre-sized cometesimals in the early stages of the Solar System. The notable structural similarities between the two lobes of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko indicate that the early-forming cometesimals experienced similar primordial stratified accretion, even though they formed independently.","Massironi, Matteo; Simioni, Emanuele; Marzari, Francesco; Cremonese, Gabriele; Giacomini, Lorenza; Pajola, Maurizio; Jorda, Laurent; Naletto, Giampiero; Lowry, Stephen; El-Maarry, Mohamed Ramy; Preusker, Frank; Scholten, Frank; Sierks, Holger; Barbieri, Cesare; Lamy, Philippe; Rodrigo, Rafael; Koschny, Detlef; Rickman, Hans; Keller, Horst Uwe; A'Hearn, Michael F.; Agarwal, Jessica; Auger, Anne-Therese; Barucci, M.

41,128,111.0,"The existence of gaseous giant planets whose orbits lie close to their host stars ('hot Jupiters') can largely be accounted for by planetary migration associated with viscous evolution of proto-planetary nebulae(1). Recently, observations of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect(2) during planetary transits have revealed that a considerable fraction of hot Jupiters are on orbits that are misaligned with respect to the spin axes of their host stars(3). This observation has cast doubt on the importance of disk-driven migration as a mechanism for producing hot Jupiters. Here I show that misaligned orbits can be a natural consequence of disk migration in binary systems whose orbital plane is uncorrelated with the spin axes of the individual stars(4-6). The gravitational torques arising from the dynamical evolution of idealized proto-planetary disks under perturbations from massive distant bodies act to misalign the orbital planes of the disks relative to the spin poles of their host stars. As a result, I suggest that in the absence of strong coupling between the angular momentum of the disk and that of the host star, or of sufficient dissipation that acts to realign the stellar spin axis and the planetary orbits, the fraction of planetary systems (including systems of 'hot Neptunes' and 'super-Earths') whose angular momentum vectors are misaligned with respect to their host stars will be commensurate with the rate of primordial stellar multiplicity.","Batygin, Konstantin","Batygin, K",418.0,"[Batygin, Konstantin] CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Batygin, Konstantin] Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Inst Theory & Computat, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11560,Article,,kbatygin@gps.caltech.edu,420,,,036MY,,,MULTIPLE-STAR-FORMATION; HOT JUPITERS; TAURUS-AURIGA; DYNAMICS; SYSTEMS; BINARY; ENVIRONMENT; SCATTERING; MIGRATION; EVOLUTION,7424.0,NATURE,Nature,English,29.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",15-Nov,3.0,LONDON,23151584.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2012.0,,"Batygin, K (reprint author), CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,102.0,A primordial origin for misalignments between stellar spin axes and planetary orbits,0.0,7.0,WOS:000311031600040,111.0,491,Multidisciplinary Sciences,102,konstantin,batygin,2083.0,66,male,1.0,04fDAYsAAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",49177410,1,49177410,1,Konstantin Batygin,Konstantin Batygin,1,1
42,14,217.0,"Photosynthetic light reactions establish electron flow in the chloroplast's thylakoid membranes, leading to the production of the ATP and NADPH that participate in carbon fixation. Two modes of electron flow exist-linear electron flow (LEF) from water to NADP 1 via photosystem (PS) II and PSI in series(1) and cyclic electron flow (CEF) around PSI (ref. 2). Although CEF is essential for satisfying the varying demand for ATP, the exact molecule(s) and operational site are as yet unclear. In the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the electron flow shifts from LEF to CEF on preferential excitation of PSII (ref. 3), which is brought about by an energy balancing mechanism between PSII and PSI (state transitions(4)). Here, we isolated a protein super-complex composed of PSI with its own light-harvesting complex (LHCI), the PSII light-harvesting complex (LHCII), the cytochrome b(6)f complex (Cyt bf), ferredoxin (Fd)-NADPH oxidoreductase (FNR), and the integral membrane protein PGRL1 (ref. 5) from C. reinhardtii cells under PSII-favouring conditions. Spectroscopic analyses indicated that on illumination, reducing equivalents from downstream of PSI were transferred to Cyt bf, whereas oxidised PSI was re-reduced by reducing equivalents from Cyt bf, indicating that this supercomplex is engaged in CEF (Supplementary Fig. 1). Thus, formation and dissociation of the PSI-LHCI-LHCII-FNR-Cyt bf-PGRL1 supercomplex not only controlled the energy balance of the two photosystems, but also switched the mode of photosynthetic electron flow.","Iwai, Masakazu; Takizawa, Kenji; Tokutsu, Ryutaro; Okamuro, Akira; Takahashi, Yuichiro; Minagawa, Jun","Iwai, M; Takizawa, K; Tokutsu, R; Okamuro, A; Takahashi, Y; Minagawa, J",1210.0,"[Iwai, Masakazu; Takizawa, Kenji; Tokutsu, Ryutaro; Minagawa, Jun] Hokkaido Univ, Inst Low Temp Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600819, Japan; [Okamuro, Akira; Takahashi, Yuichiro] Okayama Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Okayama 7008530, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08885,Article,,minagawa@lowtem.hokudai.ac.jp,U134,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology [18GS0318, 2120006309, 2157003109]; Japan Science and Technology Agency; Natural Sciences by the Mitsubishi Foundation","We thank S.

43,18,494.0,"Techniques to detect and quantify DNA and RNA molecules in biological samples have had a central role in genomics research(1-3). Over the past decade, several techniques have been developed to improve detection performance and reduce the cost of genetic analysis(4-10). In particular, significant advances in label-free methods have been reported(11-17). Yet detection of DNA molecules at concentrations below the femtomolar level requires amplified detection schemes(1,8). Here we report a unique nanomechanical response of hybridized DNA and RNA molecules that serves as an intrinsic molecular label. Nanomechanical measurements on a microarray surface have sufficient background signal rejection to allow direct detection and counting of hybridized molecules. The digital response of the sensor provides a large dynamic range that is critical for gene expression profiling. We have measured differential expressions of microRNAs in tumour samples; such measurements have been shown to help discriminate between the tissue origins of metastatic tumours(18). Two hundred picograms of total RNA is found to be sufficient for this analysis. In addition, the limit of detection in pure samples is found to be one attomolar. These results suggest that nanomechanical read-out of microarrays promises attomolar-level sensitivity and large dynamic range for the analysis of gene expression, while eliminating biochemical manipulations, amplification and labelling.","Husale, Sudhir; Persson, Henrik H.

44,36,496.0,"Cells with loss of BRCA2 function are defective in homologous recombination ( HR) and are highly sensitive to inhibitors of poly( ADP- ribose) polymerase ( PARP)(1,2), which provides the basis for a new therapeutic approach. Here we show that resistance to PARP inhibition can be acquired by deletion of a mutation in BRCA2. We derived PARP- inhibitor- resistant ( PIR) clones from the human CAPAN1 pancreatic cancer cell line, which carries the protein- truncating c.6174delT frameshift mutation. PIR clones could form DNA- damage- induced RAD51 nuclear foci and were able to limit genotoxin- induced genomic instability, both hallmarks of a competent HR pathway. New BRCA2 isoforms were expressed in the resistant lines as a result of intragenic deletion of the c.6174delT mutation and restoration of the open reading frame ( ORF). Reconstitution of BRCA2- deficient cells with these revertant BRCA2 alleles rescued PARP inhibitor sensitivity and HR deficiency. Most of the deletions in BRCA2 were associated with small tracts of homology, and possibly arose from error-prone repair caused by BRCA2 deficiency(3,4). Similar ORF-restoring mutations were present in carboplatin- resistant ovarian tumours from c.6174delT mutation carriers. These observations have implications for understanding drug resistance in BRCA mutation carriers as well as in defining functionally important domains within BRCA2.","Edwards, Stacey L.; Brough, Rachel; Lord, Christopher J.; Natrajan, Rachael; Vatcheva, Radost; Levine, Douglas A.; Boyd, Jeff; Reis-Filho, Jorge S.; Ashworth, Alan","Edwards, SL; Brough, R; Lord, CJ; Natrajan, R; Vatcheva, R; Levine, DA; Boyd, J; Reis, JS; Ashworth, A",1111.0,"[Edwards, Stacey L.; Brough, Rachel; Lord, Christopher J.; Natrajan, Rachael; Vatcheva, Radost; Reis-Filho, Jorge S.; Ashworth, Alan] Inst Canc Res, Breakthrough Breast Canc Res Ctr, London SW3 6JB, England; [Levine, Douglas A.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Surg, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Boyd, Jeff] Mem Hlth Univ Med Ctr, Anderson Canc Inst, Savannah, GA 31404 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06548,Article,,alan.ashworth@icr.ac.uk,U8,Cancer Research UK [A8363],,266RB,,,HOMOLOGY-DIRECTED REPAIR; ADP-RIBOSE POLYMERASE; GENOMIC STABILITY; IMPROVED SURVIVAL; MUTANT-CELLS; CANCER; MUTATIONS; PROTEIN; BREAKS; DEFECT,7182.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,"Lord, Christopher/0000-0002-3226-0515; ","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",28-Feb,6.0,LONDON,18264088.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,"Lord, Christopher/B-3295-2012; Edwards, Stacey/A-4980-2011","Ashworth, A (reprint author), Inst Canc Res, Breakthrough Breast Canc Res Ctr, Fulham Rd, London SW3 6JB, England.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,485.0,Resistance to therapy caused by intragenic deletion in BRCA2,2.0,42.0,WOS:000253453600043,496.0,451,Multidisciplinary Sciences,493,alan,ashworth,2416.0,2079,male,1.0,hszK3CcAAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",25979414,1,25979414,1,Alan Ashworth,Alan Ashworth,1,1
45,73,353.0,"West Africa is currently witnessing the most extensive Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak so far recorded(1-3). Until now, there have been 27,013 reported cases and 11,134 deaths. The origin of the virus is thought to have been a zoonotic transmission from a bat to a two-year-old boy in December 2013 (ref. 2). From this index case the virus was spread by human-to-human contact throughout Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. However, the origin of the particular virus in each country and time of transmission is not known and currently relies on epidemiological analysis, which may be unreliable owing to the difficulties of obtaining patient information. Here we trace the genetic evolution of EBOV in the current outbreak that has resulted in multiple lineages. Deep sequencing of 179 patient samples processed by the European Mobile Laboratory, the first diagnostics unit to be deployed to the epicentre of the outbreak in Guinea, reveals an epidemiological and evolutionary history of the epidemic from March 2014 to January 2015. Analysis of EBOV genome evolution has also benefited from a similar sequencing effort of patient samples from Sierra Leone. Our results confirm that the EBOV from Guinea moved into Sierra Leone, most likely in April or early May. The viruses of the Guinea/Sierra Leone lineage mixed around June/July 2014. Viral sequences covering August, September and October 2014 indicate that this lineage evolved independently within Guinea.

EMLab worked with WHO, MSF and the Guinean authorities to tackle the outbreak in the Gueckedou area where the samples from this study were collected. We thank those who helped make this possible and the Guinean authorities for their decision to release the diagnostic samples to EMLab for shipment to Europe to undergo further analysis, including sequencing. We acknowledge Air France, Brussels Airlines and Virgin Airlines for transporting EMLab personnel and equipment in and out of West Africa during the outbreak period; World Courier for shipping our EBOV-positive samples out of Guinea to Europe; and the logistics support units and pilots and drivers of WHO/United Nations in West Africa for transporting our people and equipment throughout the region, and especially the drivers who made the 28h round trip journey from Conakry to enable the EMLab unit to be established and resupplied in Gueckedou. We appreciate the work of the numerous European Embassies operating in West Africa who provided emergency support to our personnel at times of need. We thank M. Bull, J. Lewis, P. Payne and S. Leach from the Microbial Risk Assessment and Behavioural Science Team, Emergency Response Department, Public Health England; J. Tree from Public Health England for help with GenBank submission; and S. Price and I. Stewart for helping with the running of our software on BlueCrystal, University of Bristol. We thank the people of West Africa for their gratitude and optimism, and for their positive attitude to our presence that we encountered on the daily journey to the Ebola Treatment Centre in Gueckedou.

46,76,423.0,"Massive galaxy clusters are filled with a hot, turbulent and magnetized intra-cluster medium. Still forming under the action of gravitational instability, they grow in mass by accretion of supersonic flows. These flows partially dissipate into heat through a complex network of large-scale shocks(1), while residual transonic (near-sonic) flows create giant turbulent eddies and cascades(2,3). Turbulence heats the intra-cluster medium(4) and also amplifies magnetic energy by way of dynamo action(5-8). However, the pattern regulating the transformation of gravitational energy into kinetic, thermal, turbulent and magnetic energies remains unknown. Here we report that the energy components of the intra-cluster medium are ordered according to a permanent hierarchy, in which the ratio of thermal to turbulent to magnetic energy densities remains virtually unaltered throughout the cluster's history, despite evolution of each individual component and the drive towards equipartition of the turbulent dynamo. This result revolves around the approximately constant efficiency of turbulence generation from the gravitational energy that is freed during mass accretion, revealed by our computational model of cosmological structure formation(3,9). The permanent character of this hierarchy reflects yet another type of self-similarity in cosmology(10-13), while its structure, consistent with current data(14-18), encodes information about the efficiency of turbulent heating and dynamo action.","Miniati, Francesco; Beresnyak, Andrey","Miniati, F; Beresnyak, A",59.0,"[Miniati, Francesco] ETH, Dept Phys, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Beresnyak, Andrey] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Nordita, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Beresnyak, Andrey] Stockholm Univ, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14552,Article,1476-4687,fm@phys.ethz.ch,+,"Swiss National Supercomputing Center (CSCS) [S419, S506]",This work was supported by a grant from the Swiss National Supercomputing Center (CSCS) under project IDs S419 and S506.,CL7RN,,,LARGE-SCALE STRUCTURE; SEED MAGNETIC-FIELDS; TURBULENT MOTIONS; ROTATION MEASURES; POWER SPECTRUM; ADAPTIVE MESH; SHOCK-WAVES; REFINEMENT; GENERATION; STATISTICS,7558.0,NATURE,Nature,English,36.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2-Jul,7.0,LONDON,26135447.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2015.0,,"Miniati, F (reprint author), ETH, Dept Phys, Wolfgang Pauli Str 27, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,18.0,Self-similar energetics in large clusters of galaxies,2.0,19.0,WOS:000357169500030,423.0,523,Multidisciplinary Sciences,18,andrey,beresnyak,1503.0,147,male,0.99,RTuSgmUAAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
47,105,164.0,"The increasing demands placed on natural resources for fuel and food production require that we explore the use of efficient, sustainable feedstocks such as brown macroalgae. The full potential of brown macroalgae as feedstocks for commercial-scale fuel ethanol production, however, requires extensive re-engineering of the alginate and mannitol catabolic pathways(1-3) in the standard industrial microbe Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here we present the discovery of an alginate monomer (4-deoxy-L-erythro-5-hexoseulose uronate, or DEHU) transporter from the alginolytic eukaryote Asteromyces cruciatus(4). The genomic integration and overexpression of the gene encoding this transporter, together with the necessary bacterial alginate and deregulated native mannitol catabolism genes, conferred the ability of an S. cerevisiae strain to efficiently metabolize DEHU and mannitol. When this platform was further adapted to grow on mannitol and DEHU under anaerobic conditions, it was capable of ethanol fermentation from mannitol and DEHU, achieving titres of 4.6%(v/v) (36.2 g l(-1)) and yields up to 83% of the maximum theoretical yield from consumed sugars. These results show that all major sugars in brown macroalgae can be used as feedstocks for biofuels and value-added renewable chemicals in a manner that is comparable to traditional arable-land-based feedstocks.","Enquist-Newman, Maria; Faust, Ann Marie E.; Bravo, Daniel D.; Santos, Christine Nicole S.; Raisner, Ryan M.; Hanel, Arthur; Sarvabhowman, Preethi; Le, Chi; Regitsky, Drew D.; Cooper, Susan R.; Peereboom, Lars; Clark, Alana; Martinez, Yessica; Goldsmith, Joshua; Cho, Min Y.; Donohoue, Paul D.; Luo, Lily; Lamberson, Brigit; Tamrakar, Pramila; Kim, Edward J.; Villari, Jeffrey L.; Gill, Avinash; Tripathi, Shital A.; Karamchedu, Padma; Paredes, Carlos J.; Rajgarhia, Vineet; Kotlar, Hans Kristian; Bailey, Richard B.; Miller, Dennis J.; Ohler, Nicholas L.; Swimmer, Candace; Yoshikuni, Yasuo","Enquist-Newman, M; Faust, AME; Bravo, DD; Santos, CNS; Raisner, RM; Hanel, A; Sarvabhowman, P; Le, C; Regitsky, DD; Cooper, SR; Peereboom, L; Clark, A; Martinez, Y; Goldsmith, J; Cho, MY; Donohoue, PD; Luo, L; Lamberson, B; Tamrakar, P; Kim, EJ; Villari, JL; Gill, A; Tripathi, SA; Karamchedu, P; Paredes, CJ; Rajgarhia, V; Kotlar, HK; Bailey, RB; Miller, DJ; Ohler, NL; Swimmer, C; Yoshikuni, Y",239.0,"[Enquist-Newman, Maria; Faust, Ann Marie E.; Bravo, Daniel D.; Santos, Christine Nicole S.; Raisner, Ryan M.; Hanel, Arthur; Sarvabhowman, Preethi; Le, Chi; Regitsky, Drew D.; Cooper, Susan R.; Clark, Alana; Martinez, Yessica; Goldsmith, Joshua; Cho, Min Y.; Donohoue, Paul D.; Luo, Lily; Lamberson, Brigit; Tamrakar, Pramila; Kim, Edward J.; Villari, Jeffrey L.; Gill, Avinash; Tripathi, Shital A.; Karamchedu, Padma; Paredes, Carlos J.; Rajgarhia, Vineet; Bailey, Richard B.; Ohler, Nicholas L.; Swimmer, Candace; Yoshikuni, Yasuo] Bio Architecture Lab Inc, Berkeley, CA 94710 USA; [Peereboom, Lars; Miller, Dennis J.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Chem Engn & Mat Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Kotlar, Hans Kristian] Statoil ASA, Statoil Res Ctr, N-7005 Trondheim, Norway; [Yoshikuni, Yasuo] BALChile SA, Santiago 7550000, Chile; [Yoshikuni, Yasuo] BAL Biofuels SA, Santiago 7550000, Chile",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12771,Article,1476-4687,candacesw@yahoo.com; yoshikuni@ba-lab.com,+,DOE under an Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) award [DE-AR0000006]; CORFO INNOVA CHILE [09CTEI-6866]; Statoil ASA; agency of the US government,"We thank R.

48,107,248.0,"DNA replication initiates at defined sites called origins, which serve as binding sites for initiator proteins that recruit the replicative machinery. Origins differ in number and structure across the three domains of life(1) and their properties determine the dynamics of chromosome replication. Bacteria and some archaea replicate from single origins, whereas most archaea and all eukaryotes replicate using multiple origins. Initiation mechanisms that rely on homologous recombination operate in some viruses. Here we show that such mechanisms also operate in archaea. We use deep sequencing to study replication in Haloferax volcanii and identify four chromosomal origins of differing activity. Deletion of individual origins results in perturbed replication dynamics and reduced growth. However, a strain lacking all origins has no apparent defects and grows significantly faster than wild type. Origin-less cells initiate replication at dispersed sites rather than at discrete origins and have an absolute requirement for the recombinase RadA, unlike strains lacking individual origins. Our results demonstrate that homologous recombination alone can efficiently initiate the replication of an entire cellular genome. This raises the question of what purpose replication origins serve and why they have evolved.","Hawkins, Michelle; Malla, Sunir; Blythe, Martin J.; Nieduszynski, Conrad A.; Allers, Thorsten","Hawkins, M; Malla, S; Blythe, MJ; Nieduszynski, CA; Allers, T",544.0,"[Hawkins, Michelle; Nieduszynski, Conrad A.; Allers, Thorsten] Univ Nottingham, Queens Med Ctr, Sch Biol, Nottingham NG7 2UH, England; [Malla, Sunir; Blythe, Martin J.] Univ Nottingham, Queens Med Ctr, Deep Seq, Nottingham NG7 2UH, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12650,Article,1476-4687,conrad.nieduszynski@nottingham.ac.uk; thorsten.allers@nottingham.ac.uk,+,"Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/E023754/1, BB/G001596/1]; Royal Society","This work was supported through the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) (BB/E023754/1, BB/G001596/1).

49,119,154.0,"Human language, as well as birdsong, relies on the ability to arrange vocal elements in new sequences. However, little is known about the ontogenetic origin of this capacity. Here we track the development of vocal combinatorial capacity in three species of vocal learners, combining an experimental approach in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) with an analysis of natural development of vocal transitions in Bengalese finches (Lonchura striata domestica) and pre-lingual human infants. We find a common, stepwise pattern of acquiring vocal transitions across species. In our first study, juvenile zebra finches were trained to perform one song and then the training target was altered, prompting the birds to swap syllable order, or insert a new syllable into a string. All birds solved these permutation tasks in a series of steps, gradually approximating the target sequence by acquiring new pairwise syllable transitions, sometimes too slowly to accomplish the task fully. Similarly, in the more complex songs of Bengalese finches, branching points and bidirectional transitions in song syntax were acquired in a stepwise fashion, starting from a more restrictive set of vocal transitions. The babbling of pre-lingual human infants showed a similar pattern: instead of a single developmental shift from reduplicated to variegated babbling (that is, from repetitive to diverse sequences), we observed multiple shifts, where each new syllable type slowly acquired a diversity of pairwise transitions, asynchronously over development. Collectively, these results point to a common generative process that is conserved across species, suggesting that the long-noted gap between perceptual versus motor combinatorial capabilities in human infants(1) may arise partly from the challenges in constructing new pairwise vocal transitions.","Lipkind, Dina; Marcus, Gary F.; Bemis, Douglas K.; Sasahara, Kazutoshi; Jacoby, Nori; Takahasi, Miki; Suzuki, Kenta; Feher, Olga; Ravbar, Primoz; Okanoya, Kazuo; Tchernichovski, Ofer","Lipkind, D; Marcus, GF; Bemis, DK; Sasahara, K; Jacoby, N; Takahasi, M; Suzuki, K; Feher, O; Ravbar, P; Okanoya, K; Tchernichovski, O",104.0,"[Lipkind, Dina; Feher, Olga; Tchernichovski, Ofer] CUNY Hunter Coll, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Lipkind, Dina; Feher, Olga; Ravbar, Primoz; Tchernichovski, Ofer] CUNY City Coll, Dept Biol, New York, NY 10031 USA; [Marcus, Gary F.; Bemis, Douglas K.] NYU, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Sasahara, Kazutoshi; Takahasi, Miki; Suzuki, Kenta; Okanoya, Kazuo] RIKEN Brain Sci Inst, Lab Biolinguist, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Jacoby, Nori] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Interdisciplinary Ctr Neural Computat, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel; [Jacoby, Nori] Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Mus, IL-5290002 Ramat Gan, Israel; [Suzuki, Kenta; Okanoya, Kazuo] JST ERATO Okanoya Emot Informat Project, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Feher, Olga; Ravbar, Primoz; Tchernichovski, Ofer] CUNY, Grad Ctr, New York, NY 10016 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12173,Article,,dina.lipkind@gmail.com,+,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan; US Public Health Service grant","We thank J.

50,120,184.0,"Semaphorin 3A (Sema3A) is a diffusible axonal chemorepellent that has an important role in axon guidance(1-5). Previous studies have demonstrated that Sema3a(-/-) mice have multiple developmental defects due to abnormal neuronal innervations(6,7). Here we show in mice that Sema3A is abundantly expressed in bone, and cell-based assays showed that Sema3A affected osteoblast differentiation in a cell-autonomous fashion. Accordingly, Sema3a(-/-) mice had a low bone mass due to decreased bone formation. However, osteoblast-specific Sema3A-deficient mice (Sema3a(coli)(-/-) and Sema3a(osx)(-/-) mice) had normal bone mass, even though the expression of Sema3A in bone was substantially decreased. In contrast, mice lacking Sema3A in neurons (Sema3a(synapsin)(-/-) and Sema3a(nestin)(-/-) mice) had low bone mass, similar to Sema3a(-/-) mice, indicating that neuron-derived Sema3A is responsible for the observed bone abnormalities independent of the local effect of Sema3A in bone. Indeed, the number of sensory innervations of trabecular bone was significantly decreased in Sema3a(synapsin)(-/-) mice, whereas sympathetic innervations of trabecular bone were unchanged. Moreover, ablating sensory nerves decreased bone mass in wild-type mice, whereas it did not reduce the low bone mass in Sema3a(nestin)(-/-) mice further, supporting the essential role of the sensory nervous system in normal bone homeostasis. Finally, neuronal abnormalities in Sema3a(-/-) mice, such as olfactory development, were identified in Sema3a(synasin)(-/-) mice, demonstrating that neuron-derived Sema3A contributes to the abnormal neural development seen in Sema3a(-/-) mice, and indicating that Sema3A produced in neurons regulates neural development in an autocrine manner. This study demonstrates that Sema3A regulates bone remodelling indirectly by modulating sensory nerve development, but not directly by acting on osteoblasts.","Fukuda, Toru; Takeda, Shu; Xu, Ren; Ochi, Hiroki; Sunamura, Satoko; Sato, Tsuyoshi; Shibata, Shinsuke; Yoshida, Yutaka; Gu, Zirong; Kimura, Ayako; Ma, Chengshan; Xu, Cheng; Bando, Waka; Fujita, Koji; Shinomiya, Kenichi; Hirai, Takashi; Asou, Yoshinori; Enomoto, Mitsuhiro; Okano, Hideyuki; Okawa, Atsushi; Itoh, Hiroshi","Fukuda, T; Takeda, S; Xu, R; Ochi, H; Sunamura, S; Sato, T; Shibata, S; Yoshida, Y; Gu, ZR; Kimura, A; Ma, CS; Xu, C; Bando, W; Fujita, K; Shinomiya, K; Hirai, T; Asou, Y; Enomoto, M; Okano, H; Okawa, A; Itoh, H",490.0,"[Fukuda, Toru; Takeda, Shu; Ochi, Hiroki; Sunamura, Satoko] Keio Univ, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, Shinjyuku Ku, Tokyo 1608582, Japan; [Xu, Ren; Kimura, Ayako; Ma, Chengshan; Xu, Cheng; Fujita, Koji; Shinomiya, Kenichi; Hirai, Takashi; Asou, Yoshinori; Enomoto, Mitsuhiro; Okawa, Atsushi] Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Dept Orthoped Surg, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138549, Japan; [Xu, Ren; Ma, Chengshan; Xu, Cheng; Fujita, Koji; Okawa, Atsushi] Int Res Ctr Mol Sci Tooth & Bone Dis, Global Ctr Excellence GCOE Program, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138549, Japan; [Sato, Tsuyoshi] Saitama Med Univ, Dept Oral & Maxillofacial Surg, Moroyama, Saitama 3500495, Japan; [Shibata, Shinsuke; Okano, Hideyuki] Keio Univ, Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Shinjyuku Ku, Tokyo 1608582, Japan; [Yoshida, Yutaka; Gu, Zirong] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Dev Biol, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Kimura, Ayako] Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Hard Tissue Genome Res Ctr, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138549, Japan; [Bando, Waka; Itoh, Hiroshi] Keio Univ, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, Sect Nephrol Endocrinol & Metab,Shinjyuku Ku, Tokyo 1608582, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12115,Article,,shu-tky@umin.ac.jp,+,Funding Program for Next Generation World-Leading Researchers (NEXT Program); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke [NS065048],"We thank M.

The molecular processes of neurotransmitter binding, subsequent opening of the ion channel and ion permeation remain poorly understood. Here we present the X-ray structure of a mammalian Cys-loop receptor, the mouse serotonin 5-HT3 receptor, at 3.5 angstrom resolution. The structure of the proteolysed receptor, made up of two fragments and comprising part of the intracellular domain, was determined in complex with stabilizing nanobodies. The extracellular domain reveals the detailed anatomy of the neurotransmitter binding site capped by a nanobody. The membrane domain delimits an aqueous pore with a 4.6 angstrom constriction. In the intracellular domain, a bundle of five intracellular helices creates a closed vestibule where lateral portals are obstructed by loops. This 5-HT3 receptor structure, revealing part of the intracellular domain, expands the structural basis for understanding the operating mechanism of mammalian Cys-loop receptors.","Hassaine, Gherici; Deluz, Cedric; Grasso, Luigino; Wyss, Romain; Tol, Menno B.; Hovius, Ruud; Graff, Alexandra; Stahlberg, Henning; Tomizaki, Takashi; Desmyter, Aline; Moreau, Christophe; Li, Xiao-Dan; Poitevin, Frederic; Vogel, Horst; Nury, Hugues","Hassaine, G; Deluz, C; Grasso, L; Wyss, R; Tol, MB; Hovius, R; Graff, A; Stahlberg, H; Tomizaki, T; Desmyter, A; Moreau, C; Li, XD; Poitevin, F; Vogel, H; Nury, H",276.0,"[Hassaine, Gherici; Deluz, Cedric; Grasso, Luigino; Wyss, Romain; Tol, Menno B.; Hovius, Ruud; Vogel, Horst; Nury, Hugues] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lab Phys Chem Polymers & Membranes, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Graff, Alexandra; Stahlberg, Henning] Univ Basel, Biozentrum, Ctr Cellular Imaging & NanoAnalyt, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland; [Tomizaki, Takashi] Paul Scherrer Inst, Swiss Light Source, CH-5234 Villigen, Switzerland; [Desmyter, Aline] CNRS, UMR 7257, F-13288 Marseille, France; [Desmyter, Aline] Univ Aix Marseille, F-13288 Marseille, France; [Moreau, Christophe; Nury, Hugues] Univ Grenoble Alpes, IBS, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Moreau, Christophe; Nury, Hugues] CNRS, IBS, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Moreau, Christophe; Nury, Hugues] CEA, DSV, IBS, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Li, Xiao-Dan] Paul Scherrer Inst, Lab Biomol Res, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland; [Poitevin, Frederic] Inst Pasteur, CNRS, UMR3528, Unite Dynam Struct Macromol, F-75015 Paris, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13552,Article,1476-4687,horst.vogel@epfl.ch; hugues.nury@ibs.fr,+,Swiss National Science Foundation [31003A-133141]; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; European Community [211800]; Human Frontier Science Program; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (VenomPicoScreen project) [ANR-11-RPIB-022-04],"Research in the laboratory of H.

52,56,279.0,"The volcanoes that lie along the Earth's tectonic boundaries are fed by melt generated in the mantle. How this melt is extracted and focused to the volcanoes, however, remains an unresolved question. Here we present new theoretical results with implications for melt focusing beneath mid- ocean ridges. By modelling laboratory experiments(1,2), we test a formulation for magma dynamics and provide an explanation for localized bands of high- porosity and concentrated shear deformation observed in experiments. These bands emerge and persist at 15 degrees - 25 degrees to the plane of shear. Past theoretical work on this system predicted the emergence of melt bands(3,4) but at an angle inconsistent with experiments. Our results suggest that the observed band angle results from a balance of porosity- weakening and strain- rate- weakening deformation mechanisms. Lower band angles are predicted for greater strain-rate weakening. From these lower band angles, we estimate the orientation of melt bands beneath mid- ocean ridges and show that they may enhance magma focusing toward the ridge axis.","Katz, Richard F.; Spiegelman, Marc; Holtzman, Benjamin","Katz, RF; Spiegelman, M; Holtzman, B",676.0,"Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; Columbia Univ, Dept Appl Phys & Appl Math, New York, NY 10027 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature05039,Article,,katz@ldeo.columbia.edu,679,,,071UU,,,SPREADING CENTERS; UPWELLING MANTLE; BENEATH; EXTRACTION; FLOW; DEFORMATION; SEGREGATION; COMPACTION; BASALT; RIDGES,7103.0,NATURE,Nature,English,24.0,No,"Katz, Richard/0000-0001-8746-5430","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",10-Aug,4.0,LONDON,16900197.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,"Holtzman, Benjamin/E-8423-2010; Katz, Richard/D-3364-2009","Katz, RF (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,124.0,The dynamics of melt and shear localization in partially molten aggregates,1.0,36.0,WOS:000239630200043,279.0,442,Multidisciplinary Sciences,130,benjamin,holtzman,1539.0,1475,male,1.0,zNuJ47gAAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",4714140,1,732946,1,Harry Holtzman,Harry Holtzman,1,1

Our studies reveal the spatial arrangement of ubiquitin receptors, deubiquitinating enzymes and the protein unfolding machinery at subnanometre resolution, outlining the substrate's path to degradation. Unexpectedly, the ATPase subunits within the base unfoldase are arranged in a spiral staircase, providing insight into potential mechanisms for substrate translocation through the central pore. Large conformational rearrangements of the lid upon holoenzyme formation suggest allosteric regulation of deubiquitination.

55,34,466.0,"Our perception of the environment relies on the capacity of neural networks to adapt rapidly to changes in incoming stimuli(1-4). It is increasingly being realized that the neural code is adaptive(5), that is, sensory neurons change their responses and selectivity in a dynamic manner to match the changes in input stimuli(1,2,5). Understanding how rapid exposure, or adaptation, to a stimulus of fixed structure changes information processing by cortical networks is essential for understanding the relationship between sensory coding and behaviour(5-8). Physiological investigations of adaptation have contributed greatly to our understanding of how individual sensory neurons change their responses to influence stimulus coding(2,9-12), yet whether and how adaptation affects information coding in neural populations is unknown. Here we examine how brief adaptation ( on the timescale of visual fixation)(2,9,10) influences the structure of interneuronal correlations and the accuracy of population coding in the macaque ( Macaca mulatta) primary visual cortex ( V1). We find that brief adaptation to a stimulus of fixed structure reorganizes the distribution of correlations across the entire network by selectively reducing their mean and variability. The post- adaptation changes in neuronal correlations are associated with specific, stimulus- dependent changes in the efficiency of the population code, and are consistent with changes in perceptual performance after adaptation(2,13,14). Our results have implications beyond the predictions of current theories of sensory coding, suggesting that brief adaptation improves the accuracy of population coding to optimize neuronal performance during natural viewing.","Gutnisky, Diego A.; Dragoi, Valentin","Gutnisky, DA; Dragoi, V",220.0,"[Gutnisky, Diego A.; Dragoi, Valentin] Univ Texas Houston, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol & Anat, Houston, TX 77030 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06563,Article,,v.dragoi@uth.tmc.edu,U63,,,273JG,,,ORIENTATION DISCRIMINATION; RAPID ADAPTATION; FIRING RATE; CORTEX; TRANSMISSION; VARIABILITY; STATISTICS; SYNCHRONY; DYNAMICS; MACAQUE,7184.0,NATURE,Nature,English,32.0,No,"Gutnisky, Diego/0000-0002-8578-0039","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",13-Mar,6.0,LONDON,18337822.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,"Gutnisky, Diego/E-3846-2012","Dragoi, V (reprint author), Univ Texas Houston, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol & Anat, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,142.0,Adaptive coding of visual information in neural populations,0.0,25.0,WOS:000253925600041,466.0,452,Multidisciplinary Sciences,142,valentin,dragoi,1992.0,299,male,1.0,WIw-G10AAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
56,32,443.0,"Molecular mechanisms regulating animal seasonal breeding in response to changing photoperiod are not well understood. Rapid induction of gene expression of thyroid- hormone- activating enzyme ( type 2 deiodinase, DIO2) in the mediobasal hypothalamus ( MBH) of the Japanese quail ( Coturnix japonica) is the earliest event yet recorded in the photoperiodic signal transduction pathway. Here we show cascades of gene expression in the quail MBH associated with the initiation of photoinduced secretion of luteinizing hormone. We identified two waves of gene expression. The first was initiated about 14 h after dawn of the first long day and included increased thyrotrophin ( TSH) beta- subunit expression in the pars tuberalis; the second occurred approximately 4 h later and included increased expression of DIO2. Intracerebroventricular ( ICV) administration of TSH to short- day quail stimulated gonadal growth and expression of DIO2 which was shown to be mediated through a TSH receptor - cyclic AMP ( cAMP) signalling pathway. Increased TSH in the pars tuberalis therefore seems to trigger long- day photoinduced seasonal breeding.","Nakao, Nobuhiro; Ono, Hiroko; Yamamura, Takashi; Anraku, Tsubasa; Takagi, Tsuyoshi; Higashi, Kumiko; Yasuo, Shinobu; Katou, Yasuhiro; Kageyama, Saburo; Uno, Yumiko; Kasukawa, Takeya; Iigo, Masayuki; Sharp, Peter J.; Iwasawa, Atsushi; Suzuki, Yutaka; Sugano, Sumio; Niimi, Teruyuki; Mizutani, Makoto; Namikawa, Takao; Ebihara, Shizufumi; Ueda, Hiroki R.; Yoshimura, Takashi","Nakao, N; Ono, H; Yamamura, T; Anraku, T; Takagi, T; Higashi, K; Yasuo, S; Katou, Y; Kageyama, S; Uno, Y; Kasukawa, T; Iigo, M; Sharp, PJ; Iwasawa, A; Suzuki, Y; Sugano, S; Niimi, T; Mizutani, M; Namikawa, T; Ebihara, S; Ueda, HR; Yoshimura, T",317.0,"[Nakao, Nobuhiro; Ono, Hiroko; Yamamura, Takashi; Anraku, Tsubasa; Takagi, Tsuyoshi; Higashi, Kumiko; Yasuo, Shinobu; Katou, Yasuhiro; Kageyama, Saburo; Uno, Yumiko; Ebihara, Shizufumi; Yoshimura, Takashi] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Bioagr Sci, Chikusa Ku, Div Biomodelling, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Kasukawa, Takeya; Ueda, Hiroki R.] RIKEN, Funct Genom Subunit, Ctr Dev Biol, Chuo Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan; [Iigo, Masayuki] Utsunomiya Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Appl Biochem, Utsunomiya, Tochigi 3218505, Japan; [Sharp, Peter J.] Univ Edinburgh, Div Genet & Genom, Roslin Inst, Roslin EH25 9PS, Midlothian, Scotland; [Sharp, Peter J.] Univ Edinburgh, Div Genet & Genom, Royal Dick Sch Vet Studies, Roslin EH25 9PS, Midlothian, Scotland; [Iwasawa, Atsushi] Gifu Univ, Lab Comparat Biochem, Grad Sch Appl Biol Sci, Gifu 5011193, Japan; [Suzuki, Yutaka; Sugano, Sumio] Univ Tokyo, Dept Med Genome Sci, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; [Niimi, Teruyuki] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Bioagr Sci, Chikusa Ku, Div Biofunct Dev, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Mizutani, Makoto; Namikawa, Takao; Ebihara, Shizufumi; Yoshimura, Takashi] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Bioagr Sci, Chikusa Ku, Avian Biosci Res Ctr, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Ueda, Hiroki R.] RIKEN, Lab Syst Biol, Ctr Dev Biol, Chuo Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan; [Yoshimura, Takashi] Nagoya Univ, Chikusa Ku, Inst Adv Res, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06738,Article,,takashiy@agr.nagoya-u.ac.jp,U1,,,276BX,,,II IODOTHYRONINE DEIODINASE; COTURNIX-COTURNIX-JAPONICA; JAPANESE-QUAIL; CHICKEN THYROTROPIN; GENE-EXPRESSION; CIRCADIAN CLOCK; BETA-SUBUNIT; HORMONE; RECEPTOR; BRAIN,7185.0,NATURE,Nature,English,39.0,No,"Yoshimura, Takashi/0000-0001-7018-9652; Kasukawa, Takeya/0000-0001-5085-0802","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",20-Mar,7.0,LONDON,18354476.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,"Yoshimura, Takashi/C-8306-2012; Ueda, Hiroki/C-5037-2014; Kasukawa, Takeya/N-5070-2015","Yoshimura, T (reprint author), Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Bioagr Sci, Chikusa Ku, Div Biomodelling, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,233.0,Thyrotrophin in the pars tuberalis triggers photoperiodic response,0.0,48.0,WOS:000254117400039,443.0,452,Multidisciplinary Sciences,240,takashi,yoshimura,2197.0,16,male,1.0,70uGLR0AAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",34529736,1,18969,1,Tempest 3D,Tempest 3D,0,0
57,35,486.0,"Methylation of CpG dinucleotides is generally associated with epigenetic silencing of transcription and is maintained through cellular division(1-3). Multiple CpG sequences are rare in mammalian genomes, but frequently occur at the transcriptional start site of active genes, with most clusters of CpGs being hypomethylated(4). We reported previously that the proximal region of the trefoil factor 1 ( TFF1, also known as pS2) and oestrogen receptor alpha ( ER alpha) promoters could be partially methylated by treatment with deacetylase inhibitors(5), suggesting the possibility of dynamic changes in DNA methylation. Here we show that cyclical methylation and demethylation of CpG dinucleotides, with a periodicity of around 100 min, is characteristic for five selected promoters, including the oestrogen ( E2)- responsive pS2 gene, in human cells. When the pS2 gene is actively transcribed, DNA methylation occurs after the cyclical occupancy of ER alpha and RNA polymerase II ( polII). Moreover, we report conditions that provoke methylation cycling of the pS2 promoter in cell lines in which pS2 expression is quiescent and the proximal promoter is methylated. This coincides with a low- level re- expression of ER alpha and of pS2 transcripts.","Kangaspeska, Sara; Stride, Brenda; Metivier, Raphael; Polycarpou-Schwarz, Maria; Ibberson, David; Carmouche, Richard Paul; Benes, Vladimir; Gannon, Frank; Reid, George","Kangaspeska, S; Stride, B; Metivier, R; Polycarpou-Schwarz, M; Ibberson, D; Carmouche, RP; Benes, V; Gannon, F; Reid, G",112.0,"[Kangaspeska, Sara; Stride, Brenda; Polycarpou-Schwarz, Maria; Ibberson, David; Carmouche, Richard Paul; Benes, Vladimir; Gannon, Frank; Reid, George] European Mol Biol Lab, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Metivier, Raphael] Univ Rennes 1, SPARTE, CNRS, UMR 6026, F-35042 Rennes, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06640,Article,,george.reid@embl.de,U14,,,269SZ,,,ESTROGEN-RECEPTOR-ALPHA; CHROMATIN MODIFICATION; NUCLEAR RECEPTOR; GENE-REGULATION; TRANSCRIPTION; ORGANIZATION; MECHANISMS; DYNAMICS,7183.0,NATURE,Nature,English,23.0,No,"Benes, Vladimir/0000-0002-0352-2547","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",6-Mar,5.0,LONDON,18322535.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,"Gannon, Frank/G-1194-2015","Reid, G (reprint author), European Mol Biol Lab, Meyerhofstr 1, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,438.0,Transient cyclical methylation of promoter DNA,4.0,27.0,WOS:000253671900057,486.0,452,Multidisciplinary Sciences,455,george,reid,4060.0,2098,male,0.99,W0B1O2gAAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",239440,1,2849645,1,George Reid,George Reid,1,1
58,44,210.0,"The upper atmosphere of a planet is a transition region in which energy is transferred between the deeper atmosphere and outer space. Molecular emissions from the upper atmosphere (90-120 km altitude) of Venus can be used to investigate the energetics and to trace the circulation of this hitherto little-studied region. Previous spacecraft(1) and ground-based(2-4) observations of infrared emission from CO2, O-2 and NO have established that photochemical and dynamic activity controls the structure of the upper atmosphere of Venus. These data, however, have left unresolved the precise altitude of the emission(1) owing to a lack of data and of an adequate observing geometry(5,6). Here we report measurements of day-side CO2 non-local thermodynamic equilibrium emission at 4.3 mu m, extending from 90 to 120 km altitude, and of night-side O-2 emission extending from 95 to 100 km. The CO2 emission peak occurs at similar to 115 km and varies with solar zenith angle over a range of similar to 10 km. This confirms previous modelling(7), and permits the beginning of a systematic study of the variability of the emission. The O-2 peak emission happens at 96 km +/- 1 km, which is consistent with three-body recombination of oxygen atoms transported from the day side by a global thermospheric sub-solar to anti-solar circulation, as previously predicted(8).","Drossart, P.; Piccioni, G.; Gerard, J.

59,157,299.0,"The wavefunction is the complex distribution used to completely describe a quantum system, and is central to quantum theory. But despite its fundamental role, it is typically introduced as an abstract element of the theory with no explicit definition(1,2). Rather, physicists come to a working understanding of the wavefunction through its use to calculate measurement outcome probabilities by way of the Born rule(3). At present, the wavefunction is determined through tomographic methods(4-8), which estimate the wavefunction most consistent with a diverse collection of measurements. The indirectness of these methods compounds the problem of defining the wavefunction. Here we show that the wavefunction can be measured directly by the sequential measurement of two complementary variables of the system. The crux of our method is that the first measurement is performed in a gentle way through weak measurement(9-18), so as not to invalidate the second. The result is that the real and imaginary components of the wavefunction appear directly on our measurement apparatus. We give an experimental example by directly measuring the transverse spatial wavefunction of a single photon, a task not previously realized by any method. We show that the concept is universal, being applicable to other degrees of freedom of the photon, such as polarization or frequency, and to other quantum systems-for example, electron spins, SQUIDs (superconducting quantum interference devices) and trapped ions. Consequently, this method gives the wavefunction a straightforward and general definition in terms of a specific set of experimental operations(19). We expect it to expand the range of quantum systems that can be characterized and to initiate new avenues in fundamental quantum theory.","Lundeen, Jeff S.; Sutherland, Brandon; Patel, Aabid; Stewart, Corey; Bamber, Charles","Lundeen, JS; Sutherland, B; Patel, A; Stewart, C; Bamber, C",188.0,"[Lundeen, Jeff S.; Sutherland, Brandon; Patel, Aabid; Stewart, Corey; Bamber, Charles] CNR, Inst Natl Measurement Stand, Ottawa, ON K1A 0R6, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10120,Article,1476-4687,jeff.lundeen@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca,191,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council; Business Development Bank of Canada,This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council and the Business Development Bank of Canada.,774PE,Y,N,LINEAR OPTICS; STATES; LIGHT; REALIZATION; SPIN,7350.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,"Lundeen, Jeff/0000-0002-0978-2913","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",9-Jun,4.0,LONDON,21654800.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2011.0,"Lundeen, Jeff/E-8512-2012","Lundeen, JS (reprint author), CNR, Inst Natl Measurement Stand, 1200 Montreal Rd, Ottawa, ON K1A 0R6, Canada.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,219.0,Direct measurement of the quantum wavefunction,3.0,78.0,WOS:000291397800044,299.0,474,Multidisciplinary Sciences,220,charles,bamber,2171.0,1798,male,1.0,g7ZQe7EAAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
60,146,425.0,"Climate change is driving latitudinal and altitudinal shifts in species distribution worldwide(1,2), leading to novel species assemblages(3,4). Lags between these biotic responses and contemporary climate changes have been reported for plants and animals(5). Theoretically, the magnitude of these lags should be greatest in lowland areas, where the velocity of climate change is expected to be much greater than that in highland areas(6). We compared temperature trends to temperatures reconstructed from plant assemblages (observed in 76,634 surveys) over a 44-year period in France (1965-2008). Here we report that forest plant communities had responded to 0.54 degrees C of the effective increase of 1.07 degrees C in highland areas (500-2,600 m above sea level), while they had responded to only 0.02 degrees C of the 1.11 degrees C warming trend in lowland areas. There was a larger temperature lag (by 3.1 times) between the climate and plant community composition in lowland forests than in highland forests. The explanation of such disparity lies in the following properties of lowland, as compared to highland, forests: the higher proportion of species with greater ability for local persistence as the climate warms(7), the reduced opportunity for short-distance escapes(8,9), and the greater habitat fragmentation. Although mountains are currently considered to be among the ecosystems most threatened by climate change (owing to mountaintop extinction), the current inertia of plant communities in lowland forests should also be noted, as it could lead to lowland biotic attrition(10).","Bertrand, Romain; Lenoir, Jonathan; Piedallu, Christian; Riofrio-Dillon, Gabriela; de Ruffray, Patrice; Vidal, Claude; Pierrat, Jean-Claude; Gegout, Jean-Claude","Bertrand, R; Lenoir, J; Piedallu, C; Riofrio-Dillon, G; de Ruffray, P; Vidal, C; Pierrat, JC; Gegout, JC",517.0,"[Bertrand, Romain; Piedallu, Christian; Riofrio-Dillon, Gabriela; Pierrat, Jean-Claude; Gegout, Jean-Claude] AgroParisTech, ENGREF, UMR1092, Lab Etud Ressources Foret Bois LERFoB, F-54000 Nancy, France; [Bertrand, Romain; Piedallu, Christian; Riofrio-Dillon, Gabriela; Pierrat, Jean-Claude; Gegout, Jean-Claude] INRA, Ctr Nancy, UMR1092, Lab Etud Ressources Foret Bois LERFoB, F-54280 Champenoux, France; [Lenoir, Jonathan] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Ecoinformat & Biodivers Grp, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [de Ruffray, Patrice] Univ Strasbourg UDS, Inst Biol Mol Plantes IBMP, CNRS, F-67084 Strasbourg, France; [Vidal, Claude] Inventaire Forestier Natl, F-45290 Nogent Sur Marne, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10548,Article,,romain.bertrand@engref.agroparistech.fr,520,"French Institute of Agricultural, Forest and Environmental Engineering (ENGREF, AgroParisTech); National Forest Department (ONF); French Agency for Environment and Energy Management (ADEME); Danish Council for Independent Research - Natural Sciences [272-07-0242]; ADEME; Regional Council of Lorraine","We thank J.-D.

61,133,388.0,"Frictional processes entail the rupture(1,2) of the ensemble of discrete contacts defining a frictional interface(3,4). There are a variety of views on how best to describe the onset of dry frictional motion. These range from modelling friction with a single degree of freedom, a 'friction coefficient'(3,5), to theoretical treatments using dynamic fracture(5-8) to account for spatial and temporal dynamics along the interface. We investigated the onset of dry frictional motion by performing simultaneous high-speed measurements of the real contact area and the strain fields in the region surrounding propagating rupture tips within the dry (nominally flat) rough interfaces formed by brittle polymer blocks. Here we show that the transition from 'static' to 'dynamic' friction is quantitatively described by classical singular solutions for the motion of a rapid shear crack(5,9-13). We find that these singular solutions, originally derived to describe brittle fracture, are in excellent agreement with the experiments for slow propagation, whereas some significant discrepancies arise as the rupture velocity approaches the Rayleigh wave speed. In addition, the energy dissipated in the fracture of the contacts remains nearly constant throughout the entire range in which the rupture velocity is less than the Rayleigh wave speed, whereas the size of the dissipative zone undergoes a Lorentz-like contraction as the rupture velocity approaches the Rayleigh wave speed. This coupling between friction and fracture is critical to our fundamental understanding of frictional motion and related processes, such as earthquake dynamics.","Svetlizky, Ilya; Fineberg, Jay","Svetlizky, I; Fineberg, J",205.0,"[Svetlizky, Ilya; Fineberg, Jay] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Racah Inst Phys, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13202,Article,1476-4687,jay@mail.huji.ac.il,+,James S.

62,124,188.0,"Over the past two decades, single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have received much attention because their extraordinary properties are promising for numerous applications(1,2). Many of these properties depend sensitively on SWCNT structure, which is characterized by the chiral index (n,m) that denotes the length and orientation of the circumferential vector in the hexagonal carbon lattice. Electronic properties are particularly strongly affected, with subtle structural changes switching tubes from metallic to semiconducting with various band-gaps. Monodisperse 'single-chirality' (that is, with a single (n, m) index) SWCNTs are thus needed to fully exploit their technological potential(1,2). Controlled synthesis through catalyst engineering(3-6), end-cap engineering(7) or cloning strategies(8,9), and also tube sorting based on chromatography(10,11), density-gradient centrifugation, electrophoresis and other techniques(12), have delivered SWCNT samples with narrow distributions of tube diameter and a large fraction of a predetermined tube type. But an effective pathway to truly monodisperse SWCNTs remains elusive. The use of template molecules to unambiguously dictate the diameter and chirality of the resulting nanotube(8,13-16) holds great promise in this regard, but has hitherto had only limited practical success(7,17,18). Here we show that this bottom-up strategy can produce targeted nanotubes: we convert molecular precursors into ultrashort singly capped (6,6) 'armchair' nanotube seeds using surface-catalysed cyclodehydrogenation on a platinum (111) surface, and then elongate these during a subsequent growth phase to produce single-chirality and essentially defect-free SWCNTs with lengths up to a few hundred nanometres. We expect that our on-surface synthesis approach will provide a route to nanotube-based materials with highly optimized properties for applications such as light detectors, photovoltaics, field-effect transistors and sensors(2).","Sanchez-Valencia, Juan Ramon; Dienel, Thomas; Groening, Oliver; Shorubalko, Ivan; Mueller, Andreas; Jansen, Martin; Amsharov, Konstantin; Ruffieux, Pascal; Fasel, Roman","Sanchez-Valencia, JR; Dienel, T; Groning, O; Shorubalko, I; Mueller, A; Jansen, M; Amsharov, K; Ruffieux, P; Fasel, R",61.0,"[Sanchez-Valencia, Juan Ramon; Dienel, Thomas; Groening, Oliver; Ruffieux, Pascal; Fasel, Roman] Empa, Swiss Fed Labs Mat Sci & Technol, Nanotech Surfaces Lab, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Shorubalko, Ivan] Empa, Swiss Fed Labs Mat Sci & Technol, Lab Reliabil Sci & Technol, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Mueller, Andreas; Jansen, Martin; Amsharov, Konstantin] Max Planck Inst Solid State Res, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany; [Fasel, Roman] Univ Bern, Dept Chem & Biochem, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13607,Article,1476-4687,konstantin.amsharov@fau.de; roman.fasel@empa.ch,+,"Swiss National Science Foundation; State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation via the COST Action [MP0901]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft","This research was supported in part by the Swiss National Science Foundation and by the State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation via the COST Action MP0901 'NanoTP'.

63,96,156.0,"Neuroblastoma is a malignant paediatric tumour of the sympathetic nervous system(1). Roughly half of these tumours regress spontaneously or are cured by limited therapy. By contrast, high-risk neuroblastomas have an unfavourable clinical course despite intensive multimodal treatment, and their molecular basis has remained largely elusive(2-4). Here we have performed whole-genome sequencing of 56 neuroblastomas (high-risk, n = 39; low-risk, n = 17) and discovered recurrent genomic rearrangements affecting a chromosomal region at 5p15.33 proximal of the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (TERT). These rearrangements occurred only in high-risk neuroblastomas (12/39, 31%) in a mutually exclusive fashion with MYCN amplifications and ATRX mutations, which are known genetic events in this tumour type(1,2,5). In an extended case series (n = 217), TERT rearrangements defined a subgroup of high-risk tumours with particularly poor outcome. Despite a large structural diversity of these rearrangements, they all induced massive transcriptional upregulation of TERT. In the remaining high-risk tumours, TERT expression was also elevated in MYCN-amplified tumours, whereas alternative lengthening of telomeres was present in neuroblastomas without TERT or MYCN alterations, suggesting that telomere lengthening represents a central mechanism defining this subtype. The 5p15.33 rearrangements juxtapose the TERT coding sequence to strong enhancer elements, resulting in massive chromatin remodelling and DNA methylation of the affected region. Supporting a functional role of TERT, neuroblastoma cell lines bearing rearrangements or amplified MYCN exhibited both upregulated TERT expression and enzymatic telomerase activity. In summary, our findings show that remodelling of the genomic context abrogates transcriptional silencing of TERT in high-risk neuroblastoma and places telomerase activation in the centre of transformation in a large fraction of these tumours.","Peifer, Martin;

64,66,271.0,"Comparative analysis of multiple genomes in a phylogenetic framework dramatically improves the precision and sensitivity of evolutionary inference, producing more robust results than single-genome analyses can provide. The genomes of 12 Drosophila species, ten of which are presented here for the first time (sechellia, simulans, yakuba, erecta, ananassae, persimilis, willistoni, mojavensis, virilis and grimshawi), illustrate how rates and patterns of sequence divergence across taxa can illuminate evolutionary processes on a genomic scale. These genome sequences augment the formidable genetic tools that have made Drosophila melanogaster a pre-eminent model for animal genetics, and will further catalyse fundamental research on mechanisms of development, cell biology, genetics, disease, neurobiology, behaviour, physiology and evolution. Despite remarkable similarities among these Drosophila species, we identified many putatively non-neutral changes in protein-coding genes, non-coding RNA genes, and cis-regulatory regions. These may prove to underlie differences in the ecology and behaviour of these diverse species.","Clark, Andrew G.; Eisen, Michael B.; Smith, Douglas R.; Bergman, Casey M.; Oliver, Brian; Markow, Therese A.; Kaufman, Thomas C.; Kellis, Manolis; Gelbart, William; Iyer, Venky N.; Pollard, Daniel A.; Sackton, Timothy B.; Larracuente, Amanda M.; Singh, Nadia D.; Abad, Jose P.; Abt, Dawn N.; Adryan, Boris; Aguade, Montserrat; Akashi, Hiroshi; Anderson, Wyatt W.; Aquadro, Charles F.; Ardell, David H.; Arguello, Roman; Artieri, Carlo G.; Barbash, Daniel A.; Barker, Daniel; Barsanti, Paolo; Batterham, Phil; Batzoglou, Serafim; Begun, Dave; Bhutkar, Arjun; Blanco, Enrico; Bosak, Stephanie A.; Bradley, Robert K.; Brand, Adrianne D.; Brent, Michael R.; Brooks, Angela N.; Brown, Randall H.; Butlin, Roger K.; Caggese, Corrado; Calvi, Brian R.; de Carvalho, A.

66,232,303.0,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) remains a major medical problem. Antiviral treatment is only partially effective and a vaccine does not exist. Development of more effective therapies has been hampered by the lack of a suitable small animal model. Although xenotransplantation of immunodeficient mice with human hepatocytes has shown promise, these models are subject to important challenges. Building on the previous observation that CD81 and occludin comprise the minimal human factors required to render mouse cells permissive to HCV entry in vitro(4), we attempted murine humanization via a genetic approach. Here we show that expression of two human genes is sufficient to allow HCV infection of fully immunocompetent inbred mice. We establish a precedent for applying mouse genetics to dissect viral entry and validate the role of scavenger receptor type B class I for HCV uptake. We demonstrate that HCV can be blocked by passive immunization, as well as showing that a recombinant vaccinia virus vector induces humoral immunity and confers partial protection against heterologous challenge. This system recapitulates a portion of the HCV life cycle in an immunocompetent rodent for the first time, opening opportunities for studying viral pathogenesis and immunity and comprising an effective platform for testing HCV entry inhibitors in vivo.","Dorner, Marcus; Horwitz, Joshua A.; Robbins, Justin B.; Barry, Walter T.; Feng, Qian; Mu, Kathy; Jones, Christopher T.; Schoggins, John W.; Catanese, Maria Teresa; Burton, Dennis R.; Law, Mansun; Rice, Charles M.; Ploss, Alexander","Dorner, M; Horwitz, JA; Robbins, JB; Barry, WT; Feng, Q; Mu, K; Jones, CT; Schoggins, JW; Catanese, MT; Burton, DR; Law, M; Rice, CM; Ploss, A",208.0,"[Dorner, Marcus; Horwitz, Joshua A.; Barry, Walter T.; Feng, Qian; Mu, Kathy; Jones, Christopher T.; Schoggins, John W.; Catanese, Maria Teresa; Rice, Charles M.; Ploss, Alexander] Rockefeller Univ, Ctr Study Hepatitis C, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Robbins, Justin B.; Burton, Dennis R.; Law, Mansun] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Immunol & Microbial Sci, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Burton, Dennis R.] Scripps Res Inst, IAVI Neutralizing Antibody Ctr, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Burton, Dennis R.] Ragon Inst MGH MIT & Harvard, Boston, MA 02129 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10168,Article,,aploss@rockefeller.edu,U246,"National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases [RC1DK087193]; National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease [R01AI072613, R01AI079031, R01AI071084]; Starr Foundation; Greenberg Medical Institute; German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgesellschaft); Rockefeller University; National Institute of Health [F32DK082155, F32DK081193]","We thank J.

67,127,284.0,"The transfer of somatic cell nuclei into oocytes can give rise to pluripotent stem cells that are consistently equivalent to embryonic stem cells(1-3), holding promise for autologous cell replacement therapy(4,5). Although methods to induce pluripotent stem cells from somatic cells by transcription factors(6) are widely used in basic research, numerous differences between induced pluripotent stem cells and embryonic stem cells have been reported(7-11), potentially affecting their clinical use. Because of the therapeutic potential of diploid embryonic stem-cell lines derived from adult cells of diseased human subjects, we have systematically investigated the parameters affecting efficiency of blastocyst development and stem-cell derivation. Here we show that improvements to the oocyte activation protocol, including the use of both kinase and translation inhibitors, and cell culture in the presence of histone deacetylase inhibitors, promote development to the blastocyst stage. Developmental efficiency varied between oocyte donors, and was inversely related to the number of days of hormonal stimulation required for oocyte maturation, whereas the daily dose of gonadotropin or the total number of metaphase II oocytes retrieved did not affect developmental outcome. Because the use of concentrated Sendai virus for cell fusion induced an increase in intracellular calcium concentration, causing premature oocyte activation, we used diluted Sendai virus in calcium-free medium. Using this modified nuclear transfer protocol, we derived diploid pluripotent stem-cell lines from somatic cells of a newborn and, for the first time, an adult, a female with type 1 diabetes.","Yamada, Mitsutoshi; Johannesson, Bjarki; Sagi, Ido; Burnett, Lisa Cole; Kort, Daniel H.; Prosser, Robert W.; Paull, Daniel; Nestor, Michael W.; Freeby, Matthew; Greenberg, Ellen; Goland, Robin S.; Leibel, Rudolph L.; Solomon, Susan L.; Benvenisty, Nissim; Sauer, Mark V.; Egli, Dieter","Yamada, M; Johannesson, B; Sagi, I; Burnett, LC; Kort, DH; Prosser, RW; Paull, D; Nestor, MW; Freeby, M; Greenberg, E; Goland, RS; Leibel, RL; Solomon, SL; Benvenisty, N; Sauer, MV; Egli, D",533.0,"[Yamada, Mitsutoshi; Johannesson, Bjarki; Paull, Daniel; Nestor, Michael W.; Solomon, Susan L.; Egli, Dieter] New York Stem Cell Fdn Res Inst, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Sagi, Ido; Benvenisty, Nissim] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Silberman Inst Life Sci, Dept Genet, Stem Cell Unit, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel; [Burnett, Lisa Cole; Freeby, Matthew; Greenberg, Ellen; Goland, Robin S.; Leibel, Rudolph L.] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Pediat, Naomi Berrie Diabet Ctr, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Kort, Daniel H.; Prosser, Robert W.; Sauer, Mark V.] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Ctr Womens Reprod Care, New York, NY 10019 USA; [Kort, Daniel H.; Prosser, Robert W.; Sauer, Mark V.] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, New York, NY 10019 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13287,Article,1476-4687,d.egli@nyscf.org,+,New York Stem Cell Foundation (NYSCF); New York State Stem Cell Science (NYSTEM) IIRP [C026184]; Russell Berrie Foundation Program in Cellular Therapies of Diabetes,"This research was supported the New York Stem Cell Foundation (NYSCF) and a New York State Stem Cell Science (NYSTEM) IIRP Award no.

68,172,221.0,"ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, composed of importers and exporters, form one of the biggest protein superfamilies that transport a variety of substrates across the membrane, powered by ATP hydrolysis. Most ABC transporters are composed of two transmembrane domains and two cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding domains. Also, importers from prokaryotes usually have extra solute-binding proteins in the periplasm that are responsible for the binding of substrates(1,2). Structures of importers have been reported that suggested a two-state model for the transport mechanism(3-11). Energy-coupling factor (ECF) transporters belong to a new class of ATP-binding cassette importers. Each ECF transporter comprises an energy-coupling module consisting of a transmembrane T protein (EcfT), two nucleotide-binding proteins (EcfA and EcfA'), and another transmembrane substrate-specific binding S protein(12-14) (EcfS). Despite the similarities with ABC transporters, ECF transporters have different organizational and functional properties. The lack of solute-binding proteins in ECF transporters differentiates them clearly from the canonical ABC importers(15). Previously reported structures of the EcfS proteins RibU and ThiT clearly demonstrated the binding site of substrate riboflavin and thiamine, respectively(16,17). However, the organization of the four different components and the transport mechanism of ECF transporters remain unknown. Here we present the structure of an intact folate ECF transporter from Lactobacillus brevis at a resolution of 3 angstrom. This structure was captured in an inward-facing, nucleotide-free conformation with no bound substrate. The folate-binding protein FolT is nearly parallel to the membrane and is bound almost entirely by EcfT, which adopts an L shape and connects to EcfA and EcfA' through two coupling helices. Two conserved XRX motifs from the coupling helices of EcfT have a vital role in energy coupling by docking into EcfA-EcfA'. We propose a transport model that involves a substantial conformational change of FolT.","Xu, Ke; Zhang, Minhua; Zhao, Qin; Yu, Fang; Guo, Hui; Wang, Chengyuan; He, Fangyuan; Ding, Jianping; Zhang, Peng","Xu, K; Zhang, MH; Zhao, Q; Yu, F; Guo, H; Wang, CY; He, FY; Ding, JP; Zhang, P",268.0,"[Xu, Ke; Zhang, Minhua; Zhao, Qin; Guo, Hui; Wang, Chengyuan; He, Fangyuan; Zhang, Peng] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Biol Sci, Inst Plant Physiol & Ecol, Natl Key Lab Plant Mol Genet, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China; [Yu, Fang; Ding, Jianping] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Biol Sci, Inst Biochem & Cell Biol, State Key Lab Mol Biol, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Peng] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Biol Sci, Inst Plant Physiol & Ecol, CAS Key Lab Synthet Biol, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12046,Article,,pengzhang01@sibs.ac.cn,+,"Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2013CB127000]; Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences [2012OHTP, 2009CSP001, 2011KIP101, KSCX2-EW-J-12]; Shanghai 'Pujiang Talent' programme [11PJ1411300]","We thank X.

69,83,301.0,"Epithelial tissues maintain a robust architecture during development. This fundamental property relies on intercellular adhesion through the formation of adherens junctions containing E-cadherin molecules(1,2). Localization of E-cadherin is stabilized through a pathway involving the recruitment of actin filaments by E-cadherin(3-6). Here we identify an additional pathway that organizes actin filaments in the apical junctional region (AJR) where adherens junctions form in embryonic epithelia. This pathway is controlled by Bitesize (Btsz), a synaptotagmin-like protein(7,8) that is recruited in the AJR independently of E-cadherin and is required for epithelial stability in Drosophila embryos. On loss of btsz, E-cadherin is recruited normally to the AJR, but is not stabilized properly and actin filaments fail to form a stable continuous network. In the absence of E-cadherin, actin filaments are stable for a longer time than they are in btsz mutants. We identify two polarized cues that localize Btsz: phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate, to which Btsz binds; and Par-3. We show that Btsz binds to the Ezrin - Radixin - Moesin protein Moesin, an F-actin-binding protein that is localized apically(9) and is recruited in the AJR in a btsz-dependent manner. Expression of a dominant-negative form of Ezrin that does not bind F-actin phenocopies the loss of btsz. Thus, our data indicate that, through their interaction, Btsz and Moesin may mediate the proper organization of actin in a local domain, which in turn stabilizes E-cadherin. These results provide a mechanism for the spatial order of actin organization underlying junction stabilization in primary embryonic epithelia.","Pilot, Fanny; Philippe, Jean-Marc; Lemmers, Celine; Lecuit, Thomas","Pilot, F; Philippe, JM; Lemmers, C; Lecuit, T",580.0,"Univ Mediterrannee, CNRS, UMR 6216, Inst Biol Dev Marseille Luminy, F-13288 Marseille 09, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature04935,Article,,lecuit@ibdm.univ-mrs.fr,584,,,069NQ,,,DROSOPHILA E-CADHERIN; EPITHELIAL-CELLS; POLARITY; MORPHOGENESIS; ARMADILLO; ADHESION; REARRANGEMENT; NEUROBLASTS; MECHANISMS; OOGENESIS,7102.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",3-Aug,5.0,LONDON,16862128.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,,"Lecuit, T (reprint author), Univ Mediterrannee, CNRS, UMR 6216, Inst Biol Dev Marseille Luminy, Campus Luminy,Case 907, F-13288 Marseille 09, France.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,84.0,Spatial control of actin organization at adherens junctions by the synaptotagmin-like protein Btsz,1.0,6.0,WOS:000239455900047,301.0,442,Multidisciplinary Sciences,85,thomas,lecuit,7459.0,3753,male,1.0,K4EMassAAAAJ,3,"(4126, 9345]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
70,119,11.0,"The most important energy development of the past decade has been the wide deployment of hydraulic fracturing technologies that enable the production of previously uneconomic shale gas resources in North America(1). If these advanced gas production technologies were to be deployed globally, the energy market could see a large influx of economically competitive unconventional gas resources(2). The climate implications of such abundant natural gas have been hotly debated. Some researchers have observed that abundant natural gas substituting for coal could reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions(3-6). Others have reported that the non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions associated with shale gas production make its lifecycle emissions higher than those of coal(7,8). Assessment of the full impact of abundant gas on climate change requires an integrated approach to the global energyeconomyclimate systems, but the literature has been limited in either its geographic scope(9,10) or its coverage of greenhouse gases(2). Here we show that market-driven increases in global supplies of unconventional natural gas do not discernibly reduce the trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions or climate forcing. Our results, based on simulations from five state-of-the-art integrated assessment models(11) of energyeconomyclimate systems independently forced by an abundant gas scenario, project large additional natural gas consumption of up to +170 per cent by 2050. The impact on CO2 emissions, however, is found to be much smaller (from -2 per cent to +11 per cent), and a majority of the models reported a small increase in climate forcing (from -0.3 per cent to +7 per cent) associated with the increased use of abundant gas. Our results show that although market penetration of globally abundant gas may substantially change the future energy system, it is not necessarily an effective substitute for climate change mitigation policy(9,10).","McJeon, Haewon; Edmonds, Jae; Bauer, Nico; Clarke, Leon; Fisher, Brian; Flannery, Brian P.; Hilaire, Jerome; Krey, Volker; Marangoni, Giacomo; Mi, Raymond; Riahi, Keywan; Rogner, Holger; Tavoni, Massimo","McJeon, H; Edmonds, J; Bauer, N; Clarke, L; Fisher, B; Flannery, BP; Hilaire, J; Krey, V; Marangoni, G; Mi, R; Riahi, K; Rogner, H; Tavoni, M",482.0,"[McJeon, Haewon; Edmonds, Jae; Clarke, Leon] Pacific NW Natl Lab, JGCRI, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Bauer, Nico; Hilaire, Jerome] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Fisher, Brian; Mi, Raymond] BAEconomics, Kingston, ACT 2604, Australia; [Flannery, Brian P.] Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Krey, Volker; Riahi, Keywan; Rogner, Holger] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Marangoni, Giacomo; Tavoni, Massimo] Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, I-20156 Milan, Italy; [Marangoni, Giacomo; Tavoni, Massimo] Politecn Milan, I-20156 Milan, Italy",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13837,Article,1476-4687,haewon.mcjeon@pnnl.gov,+,"BAEconomics; Global Technology Strategy Project; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research; Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research; Italian Ministry of Environment, Land and Sea under the GEMINA project","B.F. and R.M. and their development of BAEGEM were supported by BAEconomics with assistance for special applications to the resource sector from Rio Tinto (Australia).

71,36,469.0,"The evolution of frictional strength has great fundamental and practical importance. Applications range from earthquake dynamics(1-4) to hard-drive read/write cycles(5). Frictional strength is governed by the resistance to shear of the large ensemble of discrete contacts that forms the interface that separates two sliding bodies. An interface's overall strength is determined by both the real contact area and the contacts' shear strength(6,7). Whereas the average motion of large, slowly sliding bodies is well-described by empirical friction laws(3,8-10), interface strength is a dynamic entity that is inherently related to both fast processes such as detachment/re-attachment(11-14) and the slow process of contact area rejuvenation(6,7,13,15,16). Here we show how frictional strength evolves from extremely short to long timescales, by continuous measurements of the concurrent local evolution of the real contact area and the corresponding interface motion (slip) from the first microseconds when contact detachment occurs to large (100-second) timescales. We identify four distinct and inter-related phases of evolution. First, all of the local contact area reduction occurs within a few microseconds, on the passage of a crack-like front. This is followed by the onset of rapid slip over a characteristic time, the value of which suggests a fracture-induced reduction of contact strength before any slip occurs. This rapid slip phase culminates with a sharp transition to slip at velocities an order of magnitude slower. At slip arrest, 'ageing' immediately commences as contact area increases on a characteristic timescale determined by the system's local memory of its effective contact time before slip arrest. We show how the singular logarithmic behaviour generally associated with ageing is cut off at short times(16). These results provide a comprehensive picture of how frictional strength evolves from the short times and rapid slip velocities at the onset of motion to ageing at the long times following slip arrest.","Ben-David, Oded; Rubinstein, Shmuel M.; Fineberg, Jay","Ben-David, O; Rubinstein, SM; Fineberg, J",76.0,"[Ben-David, Oded; Rubinstein, Shmuel M.; Fineberg, Jay] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Racah Inst Phys, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08676,Article,,jay@vms.huji.ac.il,79,Israel Science Foundation [57/07]; US-Israel Binational Science Foundation [2006288],"We acknowledge comments by J.

72,14,376.0,"In most eukaryotic cells, subsets of microtubules are adapted for specific functions by post-translational modifications (PTMs) of tubulin subunits. Acetylation of the epsilon-amino group of K40 on alpha-tubulin is a conserved PTM on the luminal side of microtubules(1) that was discovered in the flagella of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii(2,3). Studies on the significance of microtubule acetylation have been limited by the undefined status of the alpha-tubulin acetyltransferase. Here we show that MEC-17, a protein related to the Gcn5 histone acetyltransferases(4) and required for the function of touch receptor neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans(5,6), acts as a K40-specific acetyltransferase for alpha-tubulin. In vitro, MEC-17 exclusively acetylates K40 of alpha-tubulin. Disruption of the Tetrahymena MEC-17 gene phenocopies the K40R alpha-tubulin mutation and makes microtubules more labile. Depletion of MEC-17 in zebrafish produces phenotypes consistent with neuromuscular defects. In C. elegans, MEC-17 and its paralogue W06B11.1 are redundantly required for acetylation of MEC-12 alpha-tubulin, and contribute to the function of touch receptor neurons partly via MEC-12 acetylation and partly via another function, possibly by acetylating another protein. In summary, we identify MEC-17 as an enzyme that acetylates the K40 residue of alpha-tubulin, the only PTM known to occur on the luminal surface of microtubules.","Akella, Jyothi S.; Wloga, Dorota; Kim, Jihyun; Starostina, Natalia G.; Lyons-Abbott, Sally; Morrissette, Naomi S.; Dougan, Scott T.; Kipreos, Edward T.; Gaertig, Jacek","Akella, JS; Wloga, D; Kim, J; Starostina, NG; Lyons-Abbott, S; Morrissette, NS; Dougan, ST; Kipreos, ET; Gaertig, J",218.0,"[Akella, Jyothi S.; Wloga, Dorota; Kim, Jihyun; Starostina, Natalia G.; Dougan, Scott T.; Kipreos, Edward T.; Gaertig, Jacek] Univ Georgia, Dept Cellular Biol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Lyons-Abbott, Sally; Morrissette, Naomi S.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Mol Biol & Biochem, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09324,Article,1476-4687,jgaertig@cb.uga.edu,U111,"National Science Foundation [MBC-033965]; American Cancer Society [RSG DDC-112979]; National Institutes of Health [R01GM074212, R01AI067981, R01GM089912]","This work was supported by funds from the National Science Foundation (MBC-033965 to J.G.), American Cancer Society (RSG DDC-112979 to S.T.D.), and National Institutes of Health (R01GM074212 to E.

73,101,239.0,"Following the discovery of BRD4 as a non-oncogene addiction target in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)(1,2), bromodomain and extra terminal protein (BET) inhibitors are being explored as a promising therapeutic avenue in numerous cancers(3-5). While clinical trials have reported single-agent activity in advanced haematological malignancies(6), mechanisms determining the response to BET inhibition remain poorly understood. To identify factors involved in primary and acquired BET resistance in leukaemia, here we perform a chromatin-focused RNAi screen in a sensitive MLL-AF9; Nras(G12D)-driven AML mouse model, and investigate dynamic transcriptional profiles in sensitive and resistantmouse and human leukaemias. Our screen shows that suppression of the PRC2 complex, contrary to effects in other contexts, promotes BET inhibitor resistance in AML. PRC2 suppression does not directly affect the regulation of Brd4-dependent transcripts, but facilitates the remodelling of regulatory pathways that restore the transcription of key targets such as Myc. Similarly, while BET inhibition triggers acute MYC repression in human leukaemias regardless of their sensitivity, resistant leukaemias are uniformly characterized by their ability to rapidly restore MYC transcription. This process involves the activation and recruitment of WNT signalling components, which compensate for the loss of BRD4 and drive resistance in various cancer models. Dynamic chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing of enhancer profiles reveal that BET-resistant states are characterized by remodelled regulatory landscapes, involving the activation of a focal MYC enhancer that recruits WNT machinery in response to BET inhibition. Together, our results identify and validate WNT signalling as a driver and candidate biomarker of primary and acquired BET resistance in leukaemia, and implicate the rewiring of transcriptional programs as an important mechanism promoting resistance to BET inhibitors and, potentially, other chromatin-targeted therapies.","Rathert, Philipp; Roth, Mareike; Neumann, Tobias; Muerdter, Felix; Roe, Jae-Seok; Muhar, Matthias; Deswal, Sumit; Cerny-Reiterer, Sabine; Peter, Barbara; Jude, Julian; Hoffmann, Thomas; Boryn, Lukasz M.; Axelsson, Elin; Schweifer, Norbert; Tontsch-Grunt, Ulrike; Dow, Lukas E.; Gianni, Davide; Pearson, Mark; Valent, Peter; Stark, Alexander; Kraut, Norbert; Vakoc, Christopher R.; Zuber, Johannes","Rathert, P; Roth, M; Neumann, T; Muerdter, F; Roe, JS; Muhar, M; Deswal, S; Cerny-Reiterer, S; Peter, B; Jude, J; Hoffmann, T; Boryn, LM; Axelsson, E; Schweifer, N; Tontsch-Grunt, U; Dow, LE; Gianni, D; Pearson, M; Valent, P; Stark, A; Kraut, N; Vakoc, CR; Zuber, J",543.0,"[Rathert, Philipp; Roth, Mareike; Neumann, Tobias; Muerdter, Felix; Muhar, Matthias; Deswal, Sumit; Jude, Julian; Hoffmann, Thomas; Boryn, Lukasz M.; Axelsson, Elin; Stark, Alexander; Zuber, Johannes] Vienna Bioctr VBC, Res Inst Mol Pathol IMP, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Roe, Jae-Seok; Vakoc, Christopher R.] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; [Cerny-Reiterer, Sabine; Peter, Barbara; Valent, Peter] Med Univ Vienna, Div Hematol & Hemostaseol, Dept Internal Med 1, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Cerny-Reiterer, Sabine; Peter, Barbara; Valent, Peter] Med Univ Vienna, Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncol, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Schweifer, Norbert; Tontsch-Grunt, Ulrike; Gianni, Davide; Pearson, Mark; Kraut, Norbert] Boehringer Ingelheim Reg Ctr Vienna GmbH, A-1121 Vienna, Austria; [Dow, Lukas E.] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Med Hematol & Med Oncol, New York, NY 10065 USA",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14898,Article,1476-4687,zuber@imp.ac.at,+,"European Research Council (ERC) [336860]; SFB of the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [F4704, F4710]; European Union; ERC [242922]; Boehringer Ingelheim","We thank M.

74,75,469.0,"Dispersal has a significant impact on lifetime reproductive success(1), and is often more prevalent in one sex than the other(2). In group- living mammals, dispersal is normally male- biased and in theory this sexual bias could be a response by males to female mate preferences, competition for access to females or resources, or the result of males avoiding inbreeding(2-7). There is a lack of studies on social mammals that simultaneously assess these factors and measure the fitness consequences of male dispersal decisions. Here we show that male- biased dispersal in the spotted hyaena ( Crocuta crocuta) most probably results from an adaptive response by males to simple female mate- choice rules that have evolved to avoid inbreeding. Microsatellite profiling revealed that females preferred sires that were born into or immigrated into the female's group after the female was born. Furthermore, young females preferred short- tenured sires and older females preferred longer- tenured sires. Males responded to these female mate preferences by initiating their reproductive careers in groups containing the highest number of young females. As a consequence, 11% of males started their reproductive career in their natal group and 89% of males dispersed. Males that started reproduction in groups containing the highest number of young females had a higher long- term reproductive success than males that did not. The female mate- choice rules ensured that females effectively avoided inbreeding without the need to discriminate directly against close kin or males born in their own group, or to favour immigrant males. The extent of male dispersal as a response to such female mate preferences depends on the demographic structure of breeding groups, rather than the genetic relatedness between females and males.","Hoener, O.

75,185,196.0,"The morphological and functional development of the vertebrate nervous system is initially governed by genetic factors and subsequently refined by neuronal activity. However, fundamental features of the nervous system emerge before sensory experience is possible. Thus, activity-dependent development occurring before the onset of experience must be driven by spontaneous activity, but the origin and nature of activity in vivo remains largely untested. Here we use optical methods to show in live neonatal mice that waves of spontaneous retinal activity are present and propagate throughout the entire visual system before eye opening. This patterned activity encompassed the visual field, relied on cholinergic neurotransmission, preferentially initiated in the binocular retina and exhibited spatiotemporal correlations between the two hemispheres. Retinal waves were the primary source of activity in the midbrain and primary visual cortex, but only modulated ongoing activity in secondary visual areas. Thus, spontaneous retinal activity is transmitted through the entire visual system and carries patterned information capable of guiding the activity-dependent development of complex intra-and inter-hemispheric circuits before the onset of vision.","Ackman, James B.; Burbridge, Timothy J.; Crair, Michael C.","Ackman, JB; Burbridge, TJ; Crair, MC",219.0,"[Ackman, James B.; Burbridge, Timothy J.; Crair, Michael C.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, New Haven, CT 06510 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11529,Article,,michael.crair@yale.edu,+,"US National Institutes of Health (NIH) [P30 EY000785, R01 EY015788, T32 NS007224, T15 LM070506, T32 EY017353]; family of William Ziegler III","We thank R.

76,104,286.0,"The adult mouse mammary epithelium contains self-sustained cell lineages that form the inner luminal and outer basal cell layers, with stem and progenitor cells contributing to its proliferative and regenerative potential(1-4). A key issue in breast cancer biology is the effect of genomic lesions in specific mammary cell lineages on tumour heterogeneity and progression. The impact of transforming events on fate conversion in cancer cells of origin and thus their contribution to tumour heterogeneity remains largely elusive. Using in situ genetic lineage tracing and limiting dilution transplantation, we have unravelled the potential of PIK3CA(H1047R), one of the most frequent mutations occurring in human breast cancer(5), to induce multipotency during tumorigenesis in the mammary gland. Here we show that expression of PIK3CA(H1047R) in lineage-committed basal Lgr5-positive and luminal keratin-8-positive cells of the adult mouse mammary gland evokes cell dedifferentiation into a multipotent stem-like state, suggesting this to be a mechanism involved in the formation of heterogeneous, multi-lineage mammary tumours. Moreover, we show that the tumour cell of origin influences the frequency of malignant mammary tumours. Our results define a key effect of PIK3CA(H1047R) on mammary cell fate in the pre-neoplastic mammary gland and show that the cell of origin of PIK3CA(H1047R) tumours dictates their malignancy, thus revealing a mechanism underlying tumour heterogeneity and aggressiveness.","Koren, Shany; Reavie, Linsey; Couto, Joana Pinto; De Silva, Duvini; Stadler, Michael B.; Roloff, Tim; Britschgi, Adrian; Eichlisberger, Tobias; Kohler, Hubertus; Aina, Olulanu; Cardiff, Robert D.; Bentires-Alj, Mohamed","Koren, S; Reavie, L; Couto, JP; De Silva, D; Stadler, MB; Roloff, T; Britschgi, A; Eichlisberger, T; Kohler, H; Aina, O; Cardiff, RD; Bentires-Alj, M",114.0,"[Koren, Shany; Reavie, Linsey; Couto, Joana Pinto; De Silva, Duvini; Stadler, Michael B.; Roloff, Tim; Britschgi, Adrian; Eichlisberger, Tobias; Kohler, Hubertus; Bentires-Alj, Mohamed] Friedrich Miescher Inst Biomed Res FMI, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland; [Stadler, Michael B.] Swiss Inst Bioinformat, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland; [Aina, Olulanu; Cardiff, Robert D.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Pathol, Ctr Comparat Med, Davis, CA 95616 USA",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14669,Article,1476-4687,Bentires@fmi.ch,+,National Cancer Institute [U01 CA141582]; Novartis Research Foundation; European Research Council (ERC) [243211-PTPsBDC]; Swiss Cancer League; Swiss National Foundation; Krebsliga Beider Basel,"The authors thank R.

77,209,189.0,"One of the fascinating aspects of the history of life is the apparent increase in morphological complexity through time(1), a well known example being mammalian cheek tooth evolution(2-4). In contrast, experimental studies of development more readily show a decrease in complexity, again well exemplified by mammalian teeth, in which tooth crown features called cusps are frequently lost in mutant and transgenic mice(5-7). Here we report that mouse tooth complexity can be increased substantially by adjusting multiple signalling pathways simultaneously. We cultured teeth in vitro and adjusted ectodysplasin (EDA), activin A and sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathways, all of which are individually required for normal tooth development. We quantified tooth complexity using the number of cusps and a topographic measure of surface complexity(8). The results show that whereas activation of EDA and activin A signalling, and inhibition of SHH signalling, individually cause subtle to moderate increases in complexity, cusp number is doubled when all three pathways are adjusted in unison. Furthermore, the increase in cusp number does not result from an increase in tooth size, but from an altered primary patterning phase of development. The combination of a lack of complex mutants(5-7), the paucity of natural variants with complex phenotypes(9), and our results of greatly increased dental complexity using multiple pathways, suggests that an increase may be inherently different from a decrease in phenotypic complexity.","Harjunmaa, Enni; Kallonen, Aki; Voutilainen, Maria; Hamalainen, Keijo; Mikkola, Marja L.; Jernvall, Jukka","Harjunmaa, E; Kallonen, A; Voutilainen, M; Hamalainen, K; Mikkola, ML; Jernvall, J",324.0,"[Harjunmaa, Enni; Voutilainen, Maria; Mikkola, Marja L.; Jernvall, Jukka] Univ Helsinki, Dev Biol Program, Inst Biotechnol, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Kallonen, Aki; Hamalainen, Keijo] Univ Helsinki, Dept Phys, Div Mat Phys, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10876,Article,,jernvall@fastmail.fm,+,Academy of Finland; Sigrid Juselius Foundation; Finnish Cultural Foundation; graduate school GSBM,"We thank I.

78,153,323.0,"The El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) drives substantial variability in rainfall(1-3), severe weather(4,5), agricultural production(3,6), ecosystems(7) and disease(8) in many parts of the world. Given that further human-forced changes in the Earth's climate system seem inevitable(9,10), the possibility exists that the character of ENSO and its impacts might change over the coming century. Although this issue has been investigated many times during the past 20 years, there is very little consensus on future changes in ENSO, apart from an expectation that ENSO will continue to be a dominant source of year-to-year variability(9,11,12). Here we show that there are in fact robust projected changes in the spatial patterns of year-to-year ENSO-driven variability in both surface temperature and precipitation. These changes are evident in the two most recent generations of climate models(13,14), using four different scenarios for CO2 and other radiatively active gases(14-17). By the mid- to late twenty-first century, the projections include an intensification of both El-Nino-driven drying in the western Pacific Ocean and rainfall increases in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific. Experiments with an Atmospheric General Circulation Model reveal that robust projected changes in precipitation anomalies during El Nino years are primarily determined by a nonlinear response to surface global warming. Uncertain projected changes in the amplitude of ENSO-driven surface temperature variability have only a secondary role. Projected changes in key characteristics of ENSO are consequently much clearer than previously realized.","Power, Scott; Delage, Francois; Chung, Christine; Kociuba, Greg; Keay, Kevin","Power, S; Delage, F; Chung, C; Kociuba, G; Keay, K",541.0,"[Power, Scott; Delage, Francois; Chung, Christine; Kociuba, Greg; Keay, Kevin] Bur Meteorol, Ctr Australian Weather & Climate Res, Melbourne, Vic 3008, Australia",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12580,Article,1476-4687,s.power@bom.gov.au,+,"Australian Climate Change Science Program (ACCSP); Pacific-Australia Climate Change Science and Adaptation planning Program (PACCSAP); AusAID; Department of Industry, Innovation, Climate Change, Science, Research and Tertiary Education","We thank L.

Here we characterize the signalling events taking place during early morphogenesis of chick skeletal muscles. We show that muscle progenitors present in somites require the transient activation of NOTCH signalling to undergo terminal differentiation. The NOTCH ligand Delta1 is expressed in a mosaic pattern in neural crest cells that migrate past the somites. Gain and loss of Delta1 function in neural crest modifies NOTCH signalling in somites, which results in delayed or premature myogenesis. Our results indicate that the neural crest regulates early muscle formation by a unique mechanism that relies on the migration of Delta1-expressing neural crest cells to trigger the transient activation of NOTCH signalling in selected muscle progenitors. This dynamic signalling guarantees a balanced and progressive differentiation of the muscle progenitor pool.","Rios, Anne C.; Serralbo, Olivier; Salgado, David; Marcelle, Christophe","Rios, AC; Serralbo, O; Salgado, D; Marcelle, C",532.0,"[Rios, Anne C.; Serralbo, Olivier; Salgado, David; Marcelle, Christophe] Monash Univ, EMBL Australia, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Rios, Anne C.; Serralbo, Olivier; Salgado, David; Marcelle, Christophe] Monash Univ, ARMI, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09970,Article,,christophe.marcelle@monash.edu,U279,Agence Nationale pour le Recherche (ANR); EU,"We thank N.

80,0,12.0,"The Milankovitch theory states that global climate variability on orbital timescales from tens to hundreds of thousands of years is dominated by the summer insolation at high northern latitudes(1,2). The supporting evidence includes reconstructed air temperatures in Antarctica that are nearly in phase with boreal summer insolation and out of phase with local summer insolation(3-5). Antarctic climate is therefore thought to be driven by northern summer insolation(5). A clear mechanism that links the two hemispheres on orbital timescales is, however, missing. We propose that key Antarctic temperature records derived from ice cores are biased towards austral winter because of a seasonal cycle in snow accumulation. Using present-day estimates of this bias in the 'recorder' system, here we show that the local insolation can explain the orbital component of the temperature record without having to invoke a link to the Northern Hemisphere. Therefore, the Antarctic ice-core-derived temperature record, one of the best-dated records of the late Pleistocene temperature evolution, cannot be used to support or contradict the Milankovitch hypothesis that global climate changes are driven by Northern Hemisphere summer insolation variations.","Laepple, Thomas; Werner, Martin; Lohmann, Gerrit","Laepple, T; Werner, M; Lohmann, G",91.0,"[Laepple, Thomas; Werner, Martin; Lohmann, Gerrit] Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Bremerhaven, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09825,Article,,thomas.laepple@awi.de,94,,,729BY,,,VOSTOK ICE CORE; SOUTHERN-HEMISPHERE; CLIMATE SENSITIVITY; RECORDS; CO2; ACCUMULATION; SEASONALITY; CYCLES; OCEAN; RISE,7336.0,NATURE,Nature,English,32.0,No,"Laepple, Thomas/0000-0001-8108-7520; Werner, Martin/0000-0002-6473-0243; Lohmann, Gerrit/0000-0003-2089-733X","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",3-Mar,4.0,LONDON,21368830.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2011.0,"Laepple, Thomas/M-8783-2015; Werner, Martin/C-8067-2014","Laepple, T (reprint author), Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Bremerhaven, Germany.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,34.0,Synchronicity of Antarctic temperatures and local solar insolation on orbital timescales,1.0,22.0,WOS:000287924100040,12.0,471,Multidisciplinary Sciences,35,gerrit,lohmann,7031.0,58,male,1.0,5OTpDIoAAAAJ,3,"(4126, 9345]",4617935,1,4617935,1,Shutdown of thermohaline circulation,Shutdown of thermohaline circulation,0,0
81,30,268.0,"Previous excavations at Mata Menge and Boa Lesa in the Soa Basin of Flores, Indonesia, recovered stone artefacts in association with fossilized remains of the large-bodied Stegodon florensis florensis(1-9). Zircon fission-track ages from these sites indicated that hominins had colonized the island by 0.88 +/- 0.07 million years (Myr) ago(6). Here we describe the contents, context and age of Wolo Sege, a recently discovered archaeological site in the Soa Basin that has in situ stone artefacts and that lies stratigraphically below Mata Menge and immediately above the basement breccias of the basin. We show using Ar-40/Ar-39 dating that an ignimbrite overlying the artefact layers at Wolo Sege was erupted 1.02 +/- 0.02 Myr ago, providing a new minimum age for hominins on Flores. This predates the disappearance from the Soa Basin of 'pygmy' Stegodon sondaari and Geochelone spp. (giant tortoise), as evident at the nearby site of Tangi Talo, which has been dated to 0.90 +/- 0.07 Myr ago(10). It now seems that this extirpation or possible extinction event and the associated faunal turnover were the result of natural processes rather than the arrival of hominins(9). It also appears that the volcanic and fluvio-lacustrine deposits infilling the Soa Basin may not be old enough to register the initial arrival of hominins on the island.","Brumm, Adam; Jensen, Gitte M.; van den Bergh, Gert D.; Morwood, Michael J.; Kurniawan, Iwan; Aziz, Fachroel; Storey, Michael","Brumm, A; Jensen, GM; van den Bergh, GD; Morwood, MJ; Kurniawan, I; Aziz, F; Storey, M",748.0,"[Jensen, Gitte M.; Storey, Michael] Roskilde Univ, Dept Environm Social & Spatial Change, Quaternary Dating Lab, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; [Brumm, Adam; van den Bergh, Gert D.; Morwood, Michael J.] Univ Wollongong, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Ctr Archaeol Sci, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; [Kurniawan, Iwan; Aziz, Fachroel] Geol Survey Inst, Bandung 40122, Indonesia; [van den Bergh, Gert D.] Natl Museum Nat Hist, NL-2333 CR Leiden, Netherlands",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08844,Article,1476-4687,abrumm@uow.edu.au; storey@ruc.dk,U123,"Australian Research Council (ARC); Australian National University; McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, University of Cambridge; D.

82,203,101.0,"The development and maintenance of an epithelium requires finely balanced rates of growth and cell death. However, the mechanical and biochemical mechanisms that ensure proper feedback control of tissue growth(1-4), which when deregulated contribute to tumorigenesis, are poorly understood. Here we use the fly notum as a model system(5) to identify a novel process of crowding-induced cell delamination that balances growth to ensure the development of well-ordered cell packing. In crowded regions of the tissue, a proportion of cells undergo a serial loss of cell-cell junctions and a progressive loss of apical area, before being squeezed out by their neighbours. This path of delamination is recapitulated by a simple computational model of epithelial mechanics, in which stochastic cell loss relieves overcrowding as the system tends towards equilibrium. We show that this process of delamination is mechanistically distinct from apoptosis-mediated cell extrusion(6-8) and precedes the first signs of cell death. Overall, this analysis reveals a simple mechanism that buffers epithelia against variations in growth. Because live-cell delamination constitutes a mechanistic link between epithelial hyperplasia and cell invasion, this is likely to have important implications for our understanding of the early stages of cancer development.","Marinari, Eliana; Mehonic, Aida; Curran, Scott; Gale, Jonathan; Duke, Thomas; Baum, Buzz","Marinari, E; Mehonic, A; Curran, S; Gale, J; Duke, T; Baum, B",542.0,"[Marinari, Eliana; Curran, Scott; Baum, Buzz] UCL, MRC, Mol Cell Biol Lab, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Mehonic, Aida; Duke, Thomas] UCL, London Ctr Nanotechnol, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Mehonic, Aida; Duke, Thomas] UCL, Dept Phys & Astron, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Gale, Jonathan] UCL, UCL Ear Inst, London WC1X 8EE, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10984,Article,,b.baum@ucl.ac.uk,U177,"Cancer Research UK; University College London, Wellcome and the Royal Society","We thank J.

83,188,240.0,"The principle(1) that 'popularity is attractive' underlies preferential attachment(2), which is a common explanation for the emergence of scaling in growing networks. If new connections are made preferentially to more popular nodes, then the resulting distribution of the number of connections possessed by nodes follows power laws(3,4), as observed in many real networks(5,6). Preferential attachment has been directly validated for some real networks (including the Internet(7,8)), and can be a consequence of different underlying processes based on node fitness, ranking, optimization, random walks or duplication(9-16). Here we show that popularity is just one dimension of attractiveness; another dimension is similarity(17-24). We develop a framework in which new connections optimize certain trade-offs between popularity and similarity, instead of simply preferring popular nodes. The framework has a geometric interpretation in which popularity preference emerges from local optimization. As opposed to preferential attachment, our optimization framework accurately describes the large-scale evolution of technological (the Internet), social (trust relationships between people) and biological (Escherichia coli metabolic) networks, predicting the probability of new links with high precision. The framework that we have developed can thus be used for predicting new links in evolving networks, and provides a different perspective on preferential attachment as an emergent phenomenon.","Papadopoulos, Fragkiskos; Kitsak, Maksim; Angeles Serrano, M.; Boguna, Marian; Krioukov, Dmitri","Papadopoulos, F; Kitsak, M; Serrano, MA; Boguna, M; Krioukov, D",537.0,"[Papadopoulos, Fragkiskos] Cyprus Univ Technol, Dept Elect Engn Comp Engn & Informat, CY-3036 Limassol, Cyprus; [Kitsak, Maksim; Krioukov, Dmitri] Univ Calif San Diego, CAIDA, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Angeles Serrano, M.; Boguna, Marian] Univ Barcelona, Dept Fis Fonamental, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11459,Article,,f.papadopoulos@cut.ac.cy; dima@ucsd.edu,540,"Marie Curie International Reintegration Grant within the 7th European Community Framework Programme; MICINN [FIS2010-21781-C02-02, BFU2010-21847-C02-02]; Generalitat de Catalunya [2009SGR838]; Ramon y Cajal programme of the Spanish Ministry of Science; ICREA Academia; Generalitat de Catalunya; NSF [CNS-0964236, CNS-1039646, CNS-0722070]; DHS [N66001-08-C-2029]; DARPA [HR0011-12-1-0012]; Cisco Systems","We thank C.

84,39,113.0,"For more than 140 years, pollen tube guidance in flowering plants has been thought to be mediated by chemoattractants derived from target ovules(1). However, there has been no convincing evidence of any particular molecule being the true attractant that actually controls the navigation of pollen tubes towards ovules. Emerging data indicate that two synergid cells on the side of the egg cell emit a diffusible, species-specific signal to attract the pollen tube at the last step of pollen tube guidance(1-3). Here we report that secreted, cysteine-rich polypeptides (CRPs) in a subgroup of defensin-like proteins are attractants derived from the synergid cells. We isolated synergid cells of Torenia fournieri, a unique plant with a protruding embryo sac, to identify transcripts encoding secreted proteins as candidate molecules for the chemoattractant(s). We found two CRPs, abundantly and predominantly expressed in the synergid cell, which are secreted to the surface of the egg apparatus. Moreover, they showed activity in vitro to attract competent pollen tubes of their own species and were named as LUREs. Injection of morpholino antisense oligomers against the LUREs impaired pollen tube attraction, supporting the finding that LUREs are the attractants derived from the synergid cells of T. fournieri.","Okuda, Satohiro; Tsutsui, Hiroki; Shiina, Keiko; Sprunck, Stefanie; Takeuchi, Hidenori; Yui, Ryoko; Kasahara, Ryushiro D.; Hamamura, Yuki; Mizukami, Akane; Susaki, Daichi; Kawano, Nao; Sakakibara, Takashi; Namiki, Shoko; Itoh, Kie; Otsuka, Kurataka; Matsuzaki, Motomichi; Nozaki, Hisayoshi; Kuroiwa, Tsuneyoshi; Nakano, Akihiko; Kanaoka, Masahiro M.; Dresselhaus, Thomas; Sasaki, Narie; Higashiyama, Tetsuya","Okuda, S; Tsutsui, H; Shiina, K; Sprunck, S; Takeuchi, H; Yui, R; Kasahara, RD; Hamamura, Y; Mizukami, A; Susaki, D; Kawano, N; Sakakibara, T; Namiki, S; Itoh, K; Otsuka, K; Matsuzaki, M; Nozaki, H; Kuroiwa, T; Nakano, A; Kanaoka, MM; Dresselhaus, T; Sasaki, N; Higashiyama, T",357.0,"[Okuda, Satohiro; Tsutsui, Hiroki; Shiina, Keiko; Takeuchi, Hidenori; Yui, Ryoko; Kasahara, Ryushiro D.; Hamamura, Yuki; Mizukami, Akane; Susaki, Daichi; Kawano, Nao; Sakakibara, Takashi; Namiki, Shoko; Kanaoka, Masahiro M.; Sasaki, Narie; Higashiyama, Tetsuya] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Div Biol Sci, Chikusa Ku, Aichi 4648602, Japan; [Sprunck, Stefanie; Dresselhaus, Thomas] Univ Regensburg, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany; [Itoh, Kie] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Dept Integrated Biosci, Chiba 2778562, Japan; [Otsuka, Kurataka; Matsuzaki, Motomichi; Nozaki, Hisayoshi; Nakano, Akihiko] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biol Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Kuroiwa, Tsuneyoshi] Rikkyo St Pauls Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Res Informat Ctr Extremophile, Tokyo 1718501, Japan; [Nakano, Akihiko] RIKEN, Adv Sci Inst, Mol Membrane Biol Lab, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07882,Article,,higashi@bio.nagoya-u.ac.jp,U122,"Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (Start-up); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT), Japan [20870020]; Creative Scientific Research, MEXT, Japan [18GS0314-01]; Yamada Science Foundation, Japan; Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B), MEXT, Japan [19370017]; Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Priority Areas [18075004]; PRESTO project; Japan Science and Technology Agency, Japan","We thank T.

85,118,496.0,"Jets of highly energized plasma with relativistic velocities are associated with black holes ranging in mass from a few times that of the Sun to the billion-solar-mass black holes at the centres of galaxies(1). A popular but unconfirmed hypothesis to explain how the plasma is energized is the 'internal shock model', in which the relativistic flow is unsteady(2). Faster components in the jet catch up to and collide with slower ones, leading to internal shocks that accelerate particles and generate magnetic fields(3). This mechanism can explain the variable, high-energy emission from a diverse set of objects(4-7), with the best indirect evidence being the unseen fast relativistic flow inferred to energize slower components in X-ray binary jets(8,9). Mapping of the kinematic profiles in resolved jets has revealed precessing and helical patterns in X-ray binaries(10,11), apparent superluminal motions(12,13), and the ejection of knots (bright components) from standing shocks in the jets of active galaxies(14,15). Observations revealing the structure and evolution of an internal shock in action have, however, remained elusive, hindering measurement of the physical parameters and ultimate efficiency of the mechanism. Here we report observations of a collision between two knots in the jet of nearby radio galaxy 3C 264. Abright knot with an apparent speed of (7.0 +/- 0.8)c, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum, is in the incipient stages of a collision with a slower-moving knot of speed (1.8 +/- 0.5)c just downstream, resulting in brightening of both knots-as seen in the most recent epoch of imaging.","Meyer, Eileen T.; Georganopoulos, Markos; Sparks, William B.; Perlman, Eric; van der Marel, Roeland P.; Anderson, Jay; Sohn, Sangmo Tony; Biretta, John; Norman, Colin; Chiaberge, Marco","Meyer, ET; Georganopoulos, M; Sparks, WB; Perlman, E; van der Marel, RP; Anderson, J; Sohn, ST; Biretta, J; Norman, C; Chiaberge, M",495.0,"[Meyer, Eileen T.; Sparks, William B.; van der Marel, Roeland P.; Anderson, Jay; Biretta, John; Norman, Colin; Chiaberge, Marco] Space Telescope Sci Inst, 3700 San Martin Dr, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Meyer, Eileen T.; Georganopoulos, Markos] Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Baltimore, MD 21250 USA; [Georganopoulos, Markos] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Perlman, Eric] Florida Inst Technol, Melbourne, FL 32901 USA; [Sohn, Sangmo Tony; Norman, Colin; Chiaberge, Marco] Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Chiaberge, Marco] Ist Radio Astron, Ist Nazl Astrofis, I-40129 Bologna, Italy",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14481,Article,1476-4687,eileen.meyer@gmail.com,+,HST [GO-13327],E.T.M. acknowledges HST grant GO-13327.,DF8BN,,,GAMMA-RAY BURSTS; HUBBLE-SPACE-TELESCOPE; M87 JET; 3C 264; EMISSION; MOTION; MODEL,7553.0,NATURE,Nature,English,28.0,No,"van der Marel, Roeland/0000-0001-7827-7825; Norman, Colin/0000-0002-5222-5717","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",28-May,13.0,LONDON,26017450.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2015.0,,"Meyer, ET (reprint author), Space Telescope Sci Inst, 3700 San Martin Dr, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,6.0,A kiloparsec-scale internal shock collision in the jet of a nearby radio galaxy,2.0,5.0,WOS:000371582000002,496.0,521,Multidisciplinary Sciences,6,marco,chiaberge,4640.0,2493,male,0.99,_UA9uSEAAAAJ,3,"(4126, 9345]",48666263,1,na,0,NGC 4293,na,0,0
86,97,174.0,"It remains unclear whether biodiversity buffers ecosystems against climate extremes, which are becoming increasingly frequent worldwide(1). Early results suggested that the ecosystem productivity of diverse grassland plant communities was more resistant, changing less during drought, and more resilient, recovering more quickly after drought, than that of depauperate communities(2). However, subsequent experimental tests produced mixed results(3-13). Here we use data from 46 experiments that manipulated grassland plant diversity to test whether biodiversity provides resistance during and resilience after climate events. We show that biodiversity increased ecosystem resistance for a broad range of climate events, including wet or dry, moderate or extreme, and brief or prolonged events. Across all studies and climate events, the productivity of low-diversity communities with one or two species changed by approximately 50% during climate events, whereas that of high-diversity communities with 16-32 species was more resistant, changing by only approximately 25%. By a year after each climate event, ecosystem productivity had often fully recovered, or overshot, normal levels of productivity in both high-and low-diversity communities, leading to no detectable dependence of ecosystem resilience on biodiversity. Our results suggest that biodiversity mainly stabilizes ecosystem productivity, and productivity-dependent ecosystem services, by increasing resistance to climate events.

87,150,224.0,"The El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the Earth's most prominent source of interannual climate variability, exerting profound worldwide effects(1-7). Despite decades of research, its behaviour continues to challenge scientists. In the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean, the anomalously cool sea surface temperatures (SSTs) found during La Nina events and the warm waters of modest El Nino events both propagate westwards, as in the seasonal cycle(7). In contrast, SST anomalies propagate eastwards during extreme El Nino events, prominently in the post-1976 period(7-10), spurring unusual weather events worldwide with costly consequences(3-6,11). The cause of this propagation asymmetry is currently unknown(10). Here we trace the cause of the asymmetry to the variations in upper ocean currents in the equatorial Pacific, whereby the westward-flowing currents are enhanced during La Nina events but reversed during extreme El Nino events. Our results highlight that propagation asymmetry is favoured when the westward mean equatorial currents weaken, as is projected to be the case under global warming(12-14). By analysing past and future climate simulations of an ensemble of models with more realistic propagation, we find a doubling in the occurrences of El Nino events that feature prominent eastward propagation characteristics in a warmer world. Our analysis thus suggests that more frequent emergence of propagation asymmetry will be an indication of the Earth's warming climate.","Santoso, Agus; McGregor, Shayne; Jin, Fei-Fei; Cai, Wenju; England, Matthew H.; An, Soon-Il; McPhaden, Michael J.; Guilyardi, Eric","Santoso, A; McGregor, S; Jin, FF; Cai, WJ; England, MH; An, SI; McPhaden, MJ; Guilyardi, E",126.0,"[Santoso, Agus; McGregor, Shayne; England, Matthew H.] Univ New S Wales, Australian Res Council ARC Ctr Excellence Climate, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Santoso, Agus; McGregor, Shayne; England, Matthew H.] Univ New S Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Jin, Fei-Fei] Univ Hawaii Manoa, SOEST, Dept Meteorol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Cai, Wenju] CSIRO, Marine & Atmospher Res, Aspendale, Vic 3195, Australia; [An, Soon-Il] Yonsei Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Seoul 120749, South Korea; [McPhaden, Michael J.] NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Guilyardi, Eric] Univ Paris 06, CNRS, IPSL, Lab Oceanog & Climat Experimentat & Approches Num, F-75252 Paris 05, France; [Guilyardi, Eric] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci NCAS Climate, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12683,Article,1476-4687,a.santoso@unsw.edu.au,+,Australian Research Council; Australian Climate Change Science Programme; National Research Foundation of Korea; Korean government (MEST) [NRF-2009-C1AAA001-2009-0093042]; NOAA,"We acknowledge the World Climate Research Programme's Working Group on Coupled Modelling and all modelling groups for making the CMIP data available.

88,141,20.0,"The life cycles of many parasites involve transitions between disparate host species, requiring these parasites to go through multiple developmental stages adapted to each of these specialized niches. Transmission of malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.) from humans to the mosquito vector requires differentiation from asexual stages replicating within red blood cells into non-dividing male and female gametocytes. Although gametocytes were first described in 1880, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in commitment to gametocyte formation is extremely limited, and disrupting this critical developmental transition remains a long-standing goal(1). Here we show that expression levels of the DNA-binding protein PfAP2-G correlate strongly with levels of gametocyte formation. Using independent forward and reverse genetics approaches, we demonstrate that PfAP2-G function is essential for parasite sexual differentiation. By combining genome-wide PfAP2-G cognate motif occurrence with global transcriptional changes resulting from PfAP2-G ablation, we identify early gametocyte genes as probable targets of PfAP2-G and show that their regulation by PfAP2-G is critical for their wild-type level expression. In the asexual blood-stage parasites pfap2-g appears to be among a set of epigenetically silenced loci(2,3) prone to spontaneous activation(4). Stochastic activation presents a simple mechanism for a low baseline of gametocyte production. Overall, these findings identify PfAP2-G as a master regulator of sexual-stage development in malaria parasites and mark the first discovery of a transcriptional switch controlling a differentiation decision in protozoan parasites.","Kafsack, Bjoern F.

89,31,286.0,"The relationship between the genotype and the phenotype, or the genotype-phenotype map, is generally approached with the tools of multivariate quantitative genetics and morphometrics(1-4). Whereas studies of development(5-7) and mathematical models of development(4,8-12) may offer new insights into the genotype-phenotype map, the challenge is to make them useful at the level of microevolution. Here we report a computational model of mammalian tooth development that combines parameters of genetic and cellular interactions to produce a three-dimensional tooth from a simple tooth primordia. We systematically tinkered with each of the model parameters to generate phenotypic variation and used geometric morphometric analyses to identify, or developmentally ordinate, parameters best explaining population-level variation of real teeth. To model the full range of developmentally possible morphologies, we used a population sample of ringed seals (Phoca hispida ladogensis)(13). Seal dentitions show a high degree of variation, typically linked to the lack of exact occlusion(13-16). Our model suggests that despite the complexity of development and teeth, there may be a simple basis for dental variation. Changes in single parameters regulating signalling during cusp development may explain shape variation among individuals, whereas a parameter regulating epithelial growth may explain serial, tooth-to-tooth variation along the jaw. Our study provides a step towards integrating the genotype, development and the phenotype.","Salazar-Ciudad, Isaac; Jernvall, Jukka","Salazar-Ciudad, I; Jernvall, J",583.0,"[Salazar-Ciudad, Isaac] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Genet & Microbiol, Fac Biociencies, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Salazar-Ciudad, Isaac; Jernvall, Jukka] Univ Helsinki, Inst Biotechnol, Dev Biol Program, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Jernvall, Jukka] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08838,Article,,isaac.salazar@uab.cat; jernvall@fastmail.fm,U138,Ramon y Cajal Program [RYC-2007-00149]; Academy of Finland,"We thank I.

90,168,150.0,"Understanding the growth rate of the continental crust through timeis a fundamental issue inEarth sciences(1-8). The isotopic signatures of noble gases in the silicate Earth (mantle, crust) and in the atmosphere afford exceptional insight into the evolution through time of these geochemical reservoirs(9). However, no data for the compositions of these reservoirs exists for the distant past, and temporal exchange rates between Earth's interior and its surface are severely under-constrained owing to a lack of samples preserving the original signature of the atmosphere at the time of their formation. Here, we report the analysis of argon in Archaean (3.5-billion-year-old) hydrothermal quartz. Noble gases are hosted in primary fluid inclusions containing a mixture of Archaean freshwater and hydrothermal fluid. Our analysis reveals Archaean atmospheric argon with a Ar-40/Ar-36 value of 143 +/- 24, lower than the present-day value of 298.6 (for which Ar-40 has been produced by the radioactive decay of the potassium isotope K-40, with a half-life of 1.25 billion years; Ar-36 is primordial in origin). This ratio is consistent with an early development of the felsic crust, which might have had an important role in climate variability during the first half of Earth's history.","Pujol, Magali; Marty, Bernard; Burgess, Ray; Turner, Grenville; Philippot, Pascal","Pujol, M; Marty, B; Burgess, R; Turner, G; Philippot, P",87.0,"[Pujol, Magali; Marty, Bernard] Univ Lorraine, CRPG CNRS, F-54501 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France; [Burgess, Ray; Turner, Grenville] Univ Manchester, Sch Earth Atmospher & Environm Sci, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Philippot, Pascal] Univ Paris Diderot, CNRS, Inst Phys Globe Paris, Sorbonne Paris Cite, F-75238 Paris 5, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12152,Article,,bmarty@crpg.cnrs-nancy.fr,+,CNRS; Region Lorraine; ANR (Agence Nationale pour la Recherche); European Research Council under the European Community [267255]; Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris (IPGP); Geological Survey of Western Australia (GSWA),"We thank D.

In the conventional paradigm, simple protein structures are assumed to fold in an all-or-none process(1) that is inaccessible to experiment. Existing experimental methods therefore probe folding mechanisms indirectly. A widely used approach interprets changes in protein stability(2) and/or folding kinetics(3,4), induced by engineered mutations, in terms of the structure of the native protein. In addition to limitations in connecting energetics with structure(5), mutational methods have significant experimental uncertainties(6) and are unable to map complex networks of interactions. In contrast, analytical theory predicts small barriers to folding and the possibility of downhill folding(7,8). These theoretical predictions have been confirmed experimentally in recent years(9-11), including the observation of global downhill folding(12). However, a key remaining question is whether downhill folding can indeed lead to the high-resolution analysis of protein folding processes(13). Here we show, with the use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), that the downhill protein BBL from Escherichia coli unfolds atom by atom starting from a defined three-dimensional structure. Thermal unfolding data on 158 backbone and side-chain protons out of a total of 204 provide a detailed view of the structural events during folding. This view confirms the statistical nature of folding, and exposes the interplay between hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic forces, backbone conformation and side-chain entropy. From the data we also obtain a map of the interaction network in this protein, which reveals the source of folding cooperativity. Our approach can be extended to other proteins with marginal barriers ( less than 3RT), providing a new tool for the study of protein folding.","Sadqi, Mourad; Fushman, David; Munoz, Victor","Sadqi, M; Fushman, D; Munoz, V",317.0,"Univ Maryland, Dept Chem & Biochem, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; Univ Maryland, Ctr Biomol Struct & Org, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature04859,Article,,vmunoz@umd.edu,321,,,064WT,,,CHEMICAL-SHIFTS; SPEED LIMIT; 2-STATE; MODEL; STABILITY; DOMAIN,7100.0,NATURE,Nature,English,29.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",20-Jul,5.0,LONDON,16799571.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,,"Munoz, V (reprint author), Univ Maryland, Dept Chem & Biochem, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,177.0,Atom-by-atom analysis of global downhill protein folding,1.0,27.0,WOS:000239122100042,331.0,442,Multidisciplinary Sciences,177,victor,munoz,8882.0,2234,male,1.0,5LLRxnsAAAAJ,3,"(4126, 9345]",7356774,1,31505624,1,Víctor Muñoz,Víctor Muñoz,0,0
92,201,96.0,"The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic showed the speed with which a novel respiratory virus can spread and the ability of a generally mild infection to induce severe morbidity and mortality in a subset of the population. Recent in vitro studies show that the interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) protein family members potently restrict the replication of multiple pathogenic viruses(1-7). Both the magnitude and breadth of the IFITM proteins' in vitro effects suggest that they are critical for intrinsic resistance to such viruses, including influenza viruses. Using a knockout mouse model(8), we now test this hypothesis directly and find that IFITM3 is essential for defending the host against influenza A virus in vivo. Mice lacking Ifitm3 display fulminant viral pneumonia when challenged with a normally low-pathogenicity influenza virus, mirroring the destruction inflicted by the highly pathogenic 1918 'Spanish' influenza(9,10). Similar increased viral replication is seen in vitro, with protection rescued by the re-introduction of Ifitm3. To test the role of IFITM3 in human influenza virus infection, we assessed the IFITM3 alleles of individuals hospitalized with seasonal or pandemic influenza H1N1/09 viruses. We find that a statistically significant number of hospitalized subjects show enrichment for a minor IFITM3 allele (SNP rs12252-C) that alters a splice acceptor site, and functional assays show the minor CC genotype IFITM3 has reduced influenza virus restriction in vitro. Together these data reveal that the action of a single intrinsic immune effector, IFITM3, profoundly alters the course of influenza virus infection in mouse and humans.","Everitt, Aaron R.; Clare, Simon; Pertel, Thomas; John, Sinu P.; Wash, Rachael S.; Smith, Sarah E.; Chin, Christopher R.; Feeley, Eric M.; Sims, Jennifer S.; Adams, David J.; Wise, Helen M.; Kane, Leanne; Goulding, David; Digard, Paul; Anttila, Verneri; Baillie, J.

93,156,367.0,"Large-scale chromosome structure and spatial nuclear arrangement have been linked to control of gene expression and DNA replication and repair. Genomic techniques based on chromosome conformation capture (3C) assess contacts for millions of loci simultaneously, but do so by averaging chromosome conformations from millions of nuclei. Here we introduce single-cell Hi-C, combined with genome-wide statistical analysis and structural modelling of single-copy X chromosomes, to show that individual chromosomes maintain domain organization at the megabase scale, but show variable cell-to-cell chromosome structures at larger scales. Despite this structural stochasticity, localization of active gene domains to boundaries of chromosome territories is a hallmark of chromosomal conformation. Single-cell Hi-C data bridge current gaps between genomics and microscopy studies of chromosomes, demonstrating how modular organization underlies dynamic chromosome structure, and how this structure is probabilistically linked with genome activity patterns.","Nagano, Takashi; Lubling, Yaniv; Stevens, Tim J.; Schoenfelder, Stefan; Yaffe, Eitan; Dean, Wendy; Laue, Ernest D.; Tanay, Amos; Fraser, Peter","Nagano, T; Lubling, Y; Stevens, TJ; Schoenfelder, S; Yaffe, E; Dean, W; Laue, ED; Tanay, A; Fraser, P",59.0,"[Nagano, Takashi; Schoenfelder, Stefan; Fraser, Peter] Babraham Inst, Nucl Dynam Programme, Cambridge CB22 3AT, England; [Lubling, Yaniv; Yaffe, Eitan; Tanay, Amos] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Comp Sci & Appl Math, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Lubling, Yaniv; Yaffe, Eitan; Tanay, Amos] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Regulat Biol, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Stevens, Tim J.; Laue, Ernest D.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Biochem, Cambridge CB2 1GA, England; [Dean, Wendy] Babraham Inst, Epigenet Programme, Cambridge CB22 3AT, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12593,Article,,e.d.laue@bioc.cam.ac.uk; amos.tanay@weizmann.ac.il; peter.fraser@babraham.ac.uk,+,Medical Research Council; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council; MODHEP project; Israel Science Foundation; Wellcome Trust,"The authors thank I.

94,154,329.0,"In most eukaryotic cells microtubules undergo post-translational modifications such as acetylation of alpha-tubulin on lysine 40, a wide-spread modification restricted to a subset of microtubules that turns over slowly(1). This subset of stable microtubules accumulates in cell protrusions(2) and regulates cell polarization(3), migration and invasion(4-7). However, mechanisms restricting acetylation to these microtubules are unknown. Here we report that clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) control microtubule acetylation through a direct interaction of the alpha-tubulin acetyltransferase alpha TAT1 (refs 8, 9) with the clathrin adaptor AP2. We observe that about one-third of growing microtubule ends contact and pause at CCPs and that loss of CCPs decreases lysine 40 acetylation levels. We show that alpha TAT1 localizes to CCPs through a direct interaction with AP2 that is required for microtubule acetylation. In migrating cells, the polarized orientation of acetylated microtubules correlates with CCP accumulation at the leading edge(10), and interaction of alpha TAT1 with AP2 is required for directional migration. We conclude that microtubules contacting CCPs become acetylated by alpha TAT1. In migrating cells, this mechanism ensures the acetylation of microtubules oriented towards the leading edge, thus promoting directional cell locomotion and chemotaxis.","Montagnac, Guillaume; Meas-Yedid, Vannary; Irondelle, Marie; Castro-Castro, Antonio; Franco, Michel; Shida, Toshinobu; Nachury, Maxence V.; Benmerah, Alexandre; Olivo-Marin, Jean-Christophe; Chavrier, Philippe","Montagnac, G; Meas-Yedid, V; Irondelle, M; Castro-Castro, A; Franco, M; Shida, T; Nachury, MV; Benmerah, A; Olivo-Marin, JC; Chavrier, P",567.0,"[Montagnac, Guillaume; Irondelle, Marie; Castro-Castro, Antonio; Chavrier, Philippe] Inst Curie, Res Ctr, F-75005 Paris, France; [Montagnac, Guillaume; Irondelle, Marie; Castro-Castro, Antonio; Chavrier, Philippe] CNRS, UMR 144, F-75005 Paris, France; [Meas-Yedid, Vannary; Olivo-Marin, Jean-Christophe] Inst Pasteur, CNRS, URA 2582, Unite Anal Images Quantitat, F-75015 Paris, France; [Franco, Michel] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, CNRS, UMR 6097, Inst Pharmacol Mol & Cellulaire, F-06560 Valbonne, France; [Shida, Toshinobu; Nachury, Maxence V.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Physiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Benmerah, Alexandre] Hop Necker Enfants Malad, INSERM, U983, F-75015 Paris, France; [Benmerah, Alexandre] Univ Paris 05, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Inst Imagine, F-75015 Paris, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12571,Article,1476-4687,guillaume.montagnac@curie.fr; philippe.chavrier@curie.fr,+,Institut Curie; CNRS; Fondation ARC pour la Recherche contre le Cancer [SL220100601356]; Institut National du Cancer [2009-1-PL BIO-12-IC-1],The authors wish to thank P.

95,215,109.0,"Fumarate hydratase (FH) is an enzyme of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) that catalyses the hydration of fumarate into malate. Germline mutations of FH are responsible for hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal-cell cancer (HLRCC)(1). It has previously been demonstrated that the absence of FH leads to the accumulation of fumarate, which activates hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) at normal oxygen tensions(2-4). However, so far no mechanism that explains the ability of cells to survive without a functional TCA cycle has been provided. Here we use newly characterized genetically modified kidney mouse cells in which Fh1 has been deleted, and apply a newly developed computer model of the metabolism of these cells to predict and experimentally validate a linear metabolic pathway beginning with glutamine uptake and ending with bilirubin excretion from Fh1-deficient cells. This pathway, which involves the biosynthesis and degradation of haem, enables Fh1-deficient cells to use the accumulated TCA cycle metabolites and permits partial mitochondrial NADH production. We predicted and confirmed that targeting this pathway would render Fh1-deficient cells nonviable, while sparing wild-type Fh1-containing cells. This work goes beyond identifying a metabolic pathway that is induced in Fh1-deficient cells to demonstrate that inhibition of haem oxygenation is synthetically lethal when combined with Fh1 deficiency, providing a new potential target for treating HLRCC patients.","Frezza, Christian; Zheng, Liang; Folger, Ori; Rajagopalan, Kartik N.; MacKenzie, Elaine D.; Jerby, Livnat; Micaroni, Massimo; Chaneton, Barbara; Adam, Julie; Hedley, Ann; Kalna, Gabriela; Tomlinson, Ian P.

97,27,191.0,"The rise in Arctic near-surface air temperatures has been almost twice as large as the global average in recent decades(1-3)-a feature known as 'Arctic amplification'. Increased concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases have driven Arctic and global average warming(1,4); however, the underlying causes of Arctic amplification remain uncertain. The roles of reductions in snow and sea ice cover(5-7) and changes in atmospheric and oceanic circulation(8-10), cloud cover and water vapour(11,12) are still matters of debate. A better understanding of the processes responsible for the recent amplified warming is essential for assessing the likelihood, and impacts, of future rapid Arctic warming and sea ice loss(13,14). Here we show that the Arctic warming is strongest at the surface during most of the year and is primarily consistent with reductions in sea ice cover. Changes in cloud cover, in contrast, have not contributed strongly to recent warming. Increases in atmospheric water vapour content, partly in response to reduced sea ice cover, may have enhanced warming in the lower part of the atmosphere during summer and early autumn. We conclude that diminishing sea ice has had a leading role in recent Arctic temperature amplification. The findings reinforce suggestions that strong positive ice-temperature feedbacks have emerged in the Arctic(15), increasing the chances of further rapid warming and sea ice loss, and will probably affect polar ecosystems, ice-sheet mass balance and human activities in the Arctic(2).","Screen, James A.; Simmonds, Ian","Screen, JA; Simmonds, I",1334.0,"[Screen, James A.; Simmonds, Ian] Univ Melbourne, Sch Earth Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09051,Article,1476-4687,screenj@unimelb.edu.au,1337,Australian Research Council,We thank N.

98,11,192.0,"The observation that animal morphology tends to be conserved during the embryonic phylotypic period (a period of maximal similarity between the species within each animal phylum) led to the proposition that embryogenesis diverges more extensively early and late than in the middle, known as the hourglass model(1,2). This pattern of conservation is thought to reflect a major constraint on the evolution of animal body plans(3). Despite a wealth of morphological data confirming that there is often remarkable divergence in the early and late embryos of species from the same phylum(4-7), it is not yet known to what extent gene expression evolution, which has a central role in the elaboration of different animal forms(8,9), underpins the morphological hourglass pattern. Here we address this question using species-specific microarrays designed from six sequenced Drosophila species separated by up to 40 million years. We quantify divergence at different times during embryogenesis, and show that expression is maximally conserved during the arthropod phylotypic period. By fitting different evolutionary models to each gene, we show that at each time point more than 80% of genes fit best to models incorporating stabilizing selection, and that for genes whose evolutionarily optimal expression level is the same across all species, selective constraint is maximized during the phylotypic period. The genes that conform most to the hourglass pattern are involved in key developmental processes. These results indicate that natural selection acts to conserve patterns of gene expression during mid-embryogenesis, and provide a genome-wide insight into the molecular basis of the hourglass pattern of developmental evolution.","Kalinka, Alex T.; Varga, Karolina M.; Gerrard, Dave T.; Preibisch, Stephan; Corcoran, David L.; Jarrells, Julia; Ohler, Uwe; Bergman, Casey M.; Tomancak, Pavel","Kalinka, AT; Varga, KM; Gerrard, DT; Preibisch, S; Corcoran, DL; Jarrells, J; Ohler, U; Bergman, CM; Tomancak, P",811.0,"[Kalinka, Alex T.; Varga, Karolina M.; Preibisch, Stephan; Jarrells, Julia; Tomancak, Pavel] Max Planck Inst Mol Cell Biol & Genet, D-01307 Dresden, Germany; [Gerrard, Dave T.; Bergman, Casey M.] Univ Manchester, Fac Life Sci, Manchester M13 9PT, Lancs, England; [Corcoran, David L.; Ohler, Uwe] Duke Univ, Inst Genome Sci & Policy, Durham, NC 27708 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09634,Article,,tomancak@mpi-cbg.de,U102,Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP) [RGY0084],"We thank A.

Unexpectedly, the predicted leucine zipper and helix-loop-helix motifs do not form these structures but are part of the SDD. The ULD and SDD mediate a critical interaction with I kappa B alpha that restricts substrate specificity, and the ULD is also required for catalytic activity. The SDD mediates IKK beta dimerization, but dimerization per se is not important for maintaining IKK beta activity and instead is required for IKK beta activation.

Assembly of this helical signalling tower is hierarchical, in which MyD88 recruits IRAK4 and the MyD88-IRAK4 complex recruits the IRAK4 substrates IRAK2 or the related IRAK1. Formation of these Myddosome complexes brings the kinase domains of IRAKs into proximity for phosphorylation and activation. Composite binding sites are required for recruitment of the individual DDs in the complex, which are confirmed by mutagenesis and previously identified signalling mutations. Specificities in Myddosome formation are dictated by both molecular complementarity and correspondence of surface electrostatics. The MyD88-IRAK4-IRAK2 complex provides a template for Toll signalling in Drosophila and an elegant mechanism for versatile assembly and regulation of DD complexes in signal transduction.","Lin, Su-Chang; Lo, Yu-Chih; Wu, Hao","Lin, SC; Lo, YC; Wu, H",885.0,"[Lin, Su-Chang; Lo, Yu-Chih; Wu, Hao] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Biochem, New York, NY 10021 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09121,Article,,haowu@med.cornell.edu,U2,NIH; Cancer Research Institute; American Heart Association,"We thank K.

101,26,159.0,"Over geologic timescales, CO(2) is emitted from the Earth's interior and is removed from the atmosphere by silicate rock weathering and organic carbon burial. This balance is thought to have stabilized greenhouse conditions within a range that ensured habitable conditions(1). Changes in this balance have been attributed to changes in topographic relief, where varying rates of continental rock weathering and erosion(1,2) are superimposed on fluctuations in organic carbon burial(3). Geological strata provide an indirect yet imperfectly preserved record of this change through changing rates of sedimentation(1,2,4). Widespread observations of a recent (0-5-Myr) fourfold increase in global sedimentation rates require a global mechanism to explain them(4-6). Accelerated uplift and global cooling have been given as possible causes(2,4,6,7), but because of the links between rates of erosion and the correlated rate of weathering(8,9), an increase in the drawdown of CO(2) that is predicted to follow may be the cause of global climate change instead(2). However, globally, rates of uplift cannot increase everywhere in the way that apparent sedimentation rates do(4,10). Moreover, proxy records of past atmospheric CO(2) provide no evidence for this large reduction in recent CO(2) concentrations(11,12). Here we question whether this increase in global weathering and erosion actually occurred and whether the apparent increase in the sedimentation rate is due to observational biases in the sedimentary record(13). As evidence, we recast the ocean dissolved (10)Be/(9)Be isotope system as a weathering proxy spanning the past similar to 12 Myr (ref. 14). This proxy indicates stable weathering fluxes during the late-Cenozoic era. The sum of these observations shows neither clear evidence for increased erosion nor clear evidence for a pulse in weathered material to the ocean. We conclude that processes different from an increase in denudation caused Cenozoic global cooling, and that global cooling had no profound effect on spatially and temporally averaged weathering rates.","Willenbring, Jane K.; von Blanckenburg, Friedhelm","Willenbring, JK; von Blanckenburg, F",211.0,"[Willenbring, Jane K.; von Blanckenburg, Friedhelm] Deutsch GeoForschungsZentrum, Sect Earth Surface Geochem 3 4, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09044,Article,,jane.willenbring@sas.upenn.edu; fvb@gfz-potsdam.de,214,Alexander von Humboldt Postdoctoral Fellowship,J.K.W. gratefully acknowledges an Alexander von Humboldt Postdoctoral Fellowship.,594SS,Y,N,CLIMATE-CHANGE; ACCUMULATION RATES; BERYLLIUM; SEDIMENT; WATER; CYCLE,7295.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,"Willenbring, Jane/0000-0003-2722-9537; von Blanckenburg, Friedhelm/0000-0002-2964-717X","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",13-May,4.0,LONDON,20463736.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2010.0,"Willenbring, Jane/B-6431-2011; von Blanckenburg, Friedhelm/K-4711-2013","von Blanckenburg, F (reprint author), Deutsch GeoForschungsZentrum, Sect Earth Surface Geochem 3 4, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,145.0,Long-term stability of global erosion rates and weathering during late-Cenozoic cooling,9.0,147.0,WOS:000277558500033,159.0,465,Multidisciplinary Sciences,149,friedhelm,von blanckenburg,9446.0,6,male,1.0,TWJUQHYAAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
102,67,384.0,"It is now clear that fished populations can fluctuate more than unharvested stocks. However, it is not clear why. Here we distinguish among three major competing mechanisms for this phenomenon, by using the 50- year California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations ( CalCOFI) larval fish record. First, variable fishing pressure directly increases variability in exploited populations. Second, commercial fishing can decrease the average body size and age of a stock, causing the truncated population to track environmental fluctuations directly. Third, age- truncated or juvenescent populations have increasingly unstable population dynamics because of changing demographic parameters such as intrinsic growth rates. We find no evidence for the first hypothesis, limited evidence for the second and strong evidence for the third. Therefore, in California Current fisheries, increased temporal variability in the population does not arise from variable exploitation, nor does it reflect direct environmental tracking. More fundamentally, it arises from increased instability in dynamics. This finding has implications for resource management as an empirical example of how selective harvesting can alter the basic dynamics of exploited populations, and lead to unstable booms and busts that can precede systematic declines in stock levels.","Anderson, Christian N.

103,103,243.0,"A quantum point contact (QPC) is a narrow constriction between two wider electron reservoirs, and is the standard building block of sub-micrometre devices such as quantum dots and qubits ( the proposed basic elements of quantum computers). The conductance through a QPC changes as a function of its width in integer steps of G(0) = 2e(2)/h ( where e is the charge on an electron, and h is Planck's constant), signalling the quantization of its transverse modes(1,2). But measurements of these conductance steps also reveal an additional shoulder at a value around 0.7 G(0) (refs 1 - 4), an observation that has remained a puzzle for more than a decade. It has recently been suggested(5,6) that this phenomenon can be explained by the existence of a magnetic 'impurity' in the QPC at low electron densities. Here we present extensive numerical density-functional calculations that reveal the formation of an electronic state with a spin-1/2 magnetic moment in the channel under very general conditions.

104,47,295.0,"The Myc oncogene regulates the expression of several components of the protein synthetic machinery, including ribosomal proteins, initiation factors of translation, RNA polymerase III and ribosomal DNA(1,2). Whether and how increasing the cellular protein synthesis capacity affects the multistep process leading to cancer remains to be addressed. Here we use ribosomal protein heterozygote mice as a genetic tool to restore increased protein synthesis in E mu-Myc/+ transgenic mice to normal levels, and show that the oncogenic potential of Myc in this context is suppressed. Our findings demonstrate that the ability of Myc to increase protein synthesis directly augments cell size and is sufficient to accelerate cell cycle progression independently of known cell cycle targets transcriptionally regulated by Myc. In addition, when protein synthesis is restored to normal levels, Myc- overexpressing precancerous cells are more efficiently eliminated by programmed cell death. Our findings reveal a new mechanism that links increases in general protein synthesis rates downstream of an oncogenic signal to a specific molecular impairment in the modality of translation initiation used to regulate the expression of selective messenger RNAs. We show that an aberrant increase in cap- dependent translation downstream of Myc hyperactivation specifically impairs the translational switch to internal ribosomal entry site ( IRES)- dependent translation that is required for accurate mitotic progression. Failure of this translational switch results in reduced mitotic- specific expression of the endogenous IRES- dependent form of Cdk11 ( also known as Cdc21 and PITSLRE)(3-5), which leads to cytokinesis defects and is associated with increased centrosome numbers and genome instability in E mu-Myc/+ mice. When accurate translational control is re- established in E mu-Myc/+ mice, genome instability is suppressed. Our findings demonstrate how perturbations in translational control provide a highly specific outcome for gene expression, genome stability and cancer initiation that have important implications for understanding the molecular mechanism of cancer formation at the post- genomic level.","Barna, Maria; Pusic, Aya; Zollo, Ornella; Costa, Maria; Kondrashov, Nadya; Rego, Eduardo; Rao, Pulivarthi H.; Ruggero, Davide","Barna, M; Pusic, A; Zollo, O; Costa, M; Kondrashov, N; Rego, E; Rao, PH; Ruggero, D",971.0,"[Barna, Maria; Kondrashov, Nadya] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem & Biophys, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Pusic, Aya; Zollo, Ornella; Costa, Maria; Ruggero, Davide] Univ Calif San Francisco, Helen Diller Family Comprehens Canc Ctr, Sch Med, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Pusic, Aya; Zollo, Ornella; Costa, Maria; Ruggero, Davide] Univ Calif San Francisco, Helen Diller Family Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dept Urol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Rego, Eduardo] Univ Sao Paulo, Ctr Cell Based Therapy, Fdn Hemoctr Ribeirao Preto, BR-14048900 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Rao, Pulivarthi H.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Pediat, Houston, TX 77030 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07449,Article,1476-4687,maria.barna@ucsf.edu; Davide.Ruggero@ucsf.edu,U79,NIH; Sandler Foundation,"We thank F.

105,74,485.0,"Messenger- RNA- directed protein synthesis is accomplished by the ribosome(1-3). In eubacteria, this complex process is initiated by a specialized transfer RNA charged with formylmethionine ( tRNA(fMet))(4-6). The amino- terminal formylated methionine of all bacterial nascent polypeptides blocks the reactive amino group to prevent unfavourable side- reactions and to enhance the efficiency of translation initiation(7,8). The first enzymatic factor that processes nascent chains is peptide deformylase ( PDF)(5,9-11); it removes this formyl group as polypeptides emerge from the ribosomal tunnel(12,13) and before the newly synthesized proteins can adopt their native fold, which may bury the N terminus. Next, the N-terminal methionine is excised by methionine aminopeptidase(14). Bacterial PDFs are metalloproteases sharing a conserved N- terminal catalytic domain. All Gram- negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, possess class- 1 PDFs characterized by a carboxy- terminal alpha- helical extension(15). Studies focusing on PDF as a target for antibacterial drugs(14,16) have not revealed the mechanism of its co- translational mode of action despite indications in early work that it co- purifies with ribosomes(17). Here we provide biochemical evidence that E. coli PDF interacts directly with the ribosome via its C- terminal extension. Crystallographic analysis of the complex between the ribosome- interacting helix of PDF and the ribosome at 3.7 angstrom resolution reveals that the enzyme orients its active site towards the ribosomal tunnel exit for efficient co- translational processing of emerging nascent chains. Furthermore, we have found that the interaction of PDF with the ribosome enhances cell viability. These results provide the structural basis for understanding the coupling between protein synthesis and enzymatic processing of nascent chains, and offer insights into the interplay of PDF with the ribosome- associated chaperone trigger factor.","Bingel-Erlenmeyer, Rouven; Kohler, Rebecca; Kramer, Guenter; Sandikci, Arzu; Antolic, Snjezana; Maier, Timm; Schaffitzel, Christiane; Wiedmann, Brigitte; Bukau, Bernd; Ban, Nenad","Bingel-Erlenmeyer, R; Kohler, R; Kramer, G; Sandikci, A; Antolic, S; Maier, T; Schaffitzel, C; Wiedmann, B; Bukau, B; Ban, N",108.0,"[Bingel-Erlenmeyer, Rouven; Kohler, Rebecca; Antolic, Snjezana; Maier, Timm; Schaffitzel, Christiane; Ban, Nenad] ETH, Inst Mol Biol & Biophys, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Kramer, Guenter; Sandikci, Arzu; Bukau, Bernd] Univ Heidelberg, Zentrum Mol Biol ZMBH, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Wiedmann, Brigitte] Novartis Inst Biomed Res Inc, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06683,Article,,ban@mol.biol.ethz.ch,U13,,,269SZ,,,ESCHERICHIA-COLI; PROTEIN-SYNTHESIS; TRIGGER FACTOR; IN-VITRO; INITIATION; TRANSLATION; EXCISION; RESIDUE; DOMAIN; AGENTS,7183.0,NATURE,Nature,English,37.0,No,"Maier, Timm/0000-0002-7459-1363; Berger-Schaffitzel, Christiane Helene/0000-0002-1516-9760","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",6-Mar,6.0,LONDON,18288106.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,"Maier, Timm/A-8835-2016","Ban, N (reprint author), ETH, Inst Mol Biol & Biophys, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,57.0,A peptide deformylase-ribosome complex reveals mechanism of nascent chain processing,2.0,23.0,WOS:000253671900056,485.0,452,Multidisciplinary Sciences,57,nenad,ban,15983.0,85,male,0.98,9I_TYlsAAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",39020545,1,39020545,1,Nenad Ban,Nenad Ban,1,1
106,35,419.0,"The nature of the pseudogap phase is a central problem in the effort to understand the high-transition-temperature (high-T-c) copper oxide superconductors(1). A fundamental question is what symmetries are broken when the pseudogap phase sets in, which occurs when the temperature decreases below a value T*. There is evidence from measurements of both polarized neutron diffraction(2,3) and the polar Kerr effect(4) that time-reversal symmetry is broken, but at temperatures that differ significantly from one another. Broken rotational symmetry was detected from both resistivity measurements(5) and inelastic neutron scattering(6-8) at low doping, and from scanning tunnelling spectroscopy(9,10) at low temperature, but showed no clear relation to T*. Here we report the observation of a large in-plane anisotropy of the Nernst effect in YBa2Cu3Oy that sets in precisely at T* throughout the doping phase diagram. We show that the CuO chains of the orthorhombic lattice are not responsible for this anisotropy, which is therefore an intrinsic property of the CuO2 planes. We conclude that the pseudogap phase is an electronic state that strongly breaks four-fold rotational symmetry. This narrows the range of possible states considerably, pointing to stripe or nematic order(11,12).","Daou, R.; Chang, J.; LeBoeuf, David; Cyr-Choiniere, Olivier; Laliberte, Francis; Doiron-Leyraud, Nicolas; Ramshaw, B.

107,163,5.0,"Some evolutionary innovations may originate non-adaptively as exaptations, or pre-adaptations, which are by-products of other adaptive traits(1-5). Examples include feathers, which originated before they were used in flight(2), and lens crystallins, which are light-refracting proteins that originated as enzymes(6). The question of how often adaptive traits have non-adaptive origins has profound implications for evolutionary biology, but is difficult to address systematically. Here we consider this issue in metabolism, one of the most ancient biological systems that is central to all life. We analyse a metabolic trait of great adaptive importance: the ability of a metabolic reaction network to synthesize all biomass from a single source of carbon and energy. We use novel computational methods to sample randomly many metabolic networks that can sustain life on any given carbon source but contain an otherwise random set of known biochemical reactions. We show that when we require such networks to be viable on one particular carbon source, they are typically also viable on multiple other carbon sources that were not targets of selection. For example, viability on glucose may entail viability on up to 44 other sole carbon sources. Any one adaptation in these metabolic systems typically entails multiple potential exaptations. Metabolic systems thus contain a latent potential for evolutionary innovations with non-adaptive origins. Our observations suggest that many more metabolic traits may have non-adaptive origins than is appreciated at present. They also challenge our ability to distinguish adaptive from non-adaptive traits.","Barve, Aditya; Wagner, Andreas","Barve, A; Wagner, A",203.0,"[Barve, Aditya; Wagner, Andreas] Univ Zurich, Inst Evolutionary Biol & Environm Sci, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Barve, Aditya; Wagner, Andreas] Swiss Inst Bioinformat, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Wagner, Andreas] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12301,Article,1476-4687,andreas.wagner@ieu.uzh.ch,+,Swiss National Science Foundation [315230-129708],"We thank K.

108,162,482.0,"The cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent catabolite repression effect in Escherichia coli is among the most intensely studied regulatory processes in biology. However, the physiological function(s) of cAMP signalling and its molecular triggers remain elusive. Here we use a quantitative physiological approach to show that cAMP signalling tightly coordinates the expression of catabolic proteins with biosynthetic and ribosomal proteins, in accordance with the cellular metabolic needs during exponential growth. The expression of carbon catabolic genes increased linearly with decreasing growth rates upon limitation of carbon influx, but decreased linearly with decreasing growth rate upon limitation of nitrogen or sulphur influx. In contrast, the expression of biosynthetic genes showed the opposite linear growth-rate dependence as the catabolic genes. A coarse-grained mathematical model provides a quantitative framework for understanding and predicting gene expression responses to catabolic and anabolic limitations. A scheme of integral feedback control featuring the inhibition of cAMP signalling by metabolic precursors is proposed and validated. These results reveal a key physiological role of cAMP-dependent catabolite repression: to ensure that proteomic resources are spent on distinct metabolic sectors as needed in different nutrient environments. Our findings underscore the power of quantitative physiology in unravelling the underlying functions of complex molecular signalling networks.","You, Conghui; Okano, Hiroyuki; Hui, Sheng; Zhang, Zhongge; Kim, Minsu; Gunderson, Carl W.; Wang, Yi-Ping; Lenz, Peter; Yan, Dalai; Hwa, Terence","You, CH; Okano, H; Hui, S; Zhang, ZG; Kim, M; Gunderson, CW; Wang, YP; Lenz, P; Yan, DL; Hwa, T",301.0,"[You, Conghui; Okano, Hiroyuki; Hui, Sheng; Kim, Minsu; Hwa, Terence] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Phys, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [You, Conghui; Okano, Hiroyuki; Zhang, Zhongge; Gunderson, Carl W.; Hwa, Terence] Univ Calif San Diego, Div Biol Sci, Sect Mol Biol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Hui, Sheng; Hwa, Terence] Univ Calif San Diego, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Wang, Yi-Ping] Peking Univ, Coll Life Sci, State Key Lab Prot & Plant Gene Res, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Lenz, Peter] Univ Marburg, Dept Phys, D-35032 Marburg, Germany; [Lenz, Peter] Univ Marburg, Ctr Synthet Microbiol, D-35032 Marburg, Germany; [Yan, Dalai] Indiana Univ Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12446,Article,,hwa@ucsd.edu,306,Human Frontiers in Science Program [RGP0022]; NSF [PHY1058793]; NSF through the Center for Theoretical Biological Physics [PHY0822283],"We are grateful to R.

The recently discovered(2) transiting planet WASP-12b has a mass M = 1.4 +/- 0.1 Jupiter masses (M(J)), a mean orbital distance of only 3.1 stellar radii ( meaning it is subject to intense tidal forces), and a period of 1.1 days. Its radius 1.79 +/- 0.09 R(J) is unexpectedly large and its orbital eccentricity 0.049 +/- 0.015 is even more surprising because such close orbits are usually quickly circularized. Here we report an analysis of its properties, which reveals that the planet is losing mass to its host star at a rate of about 10(-7) M(J) per year. The planet's surface is distorted by the star's gravity and the light curve produced by its prolate shape will differ by about ten per cent from that of a spherical planet. We conclude that dissipation of the star's tidal perturbation in the planet's convective envelope provides the energy source for its large volume. We predict up to 10 mJy CO band-head (2.292 mu m) emission from a tenuous disk around the host star, made up of tidally stripped planetary gas. It may also contain a detectable resonant super-Earth, as a hypothetical perturber that continually stirs up WASP-12b's eccentricity.","Li, Shu-lin; Miller, N.; Lin, Douglas N.

111,3,76.0,"X-ray lasers offer new capabilities in understanding the structure of biological systems, complex materials and matter under extreme conditions(1-4). Very short and extremely bright, coherent X-ray pulses can be used to outrun key damage processes and obtain a single diffraction pattern from a large macromolecule, a virus or a cell before the sample explodes and turns into plasma(1). The continuous diffraction pattern of non-crystalline objects permits oversampling and direct phase retrieval(2). Here we show that high-quality diffraction data can be obtained with a single X-ray pulse from a noncrystalline biological sample, a single mimivirus particle, which was injected into the pulsed beam of a hard-X-ray free-electron laser, the Linac Coherent Light Source(5). Calculations indicate that the energy deposited into the virus by the pulse heated the particle to over 100,000 K after the pulse had left the sample. The reconstructed exit wavefront (image) yielded 32-nm full-period resolution in a single exposure and showed no measurable damage.

112,72,440.0,"Stomatal pores, formed by two surrounding guard cells in the epidermis of plant leaves, allow influx of atmospheric carbon dioxide in exchange for transpirational water loss. Stomata also restrict the entry of ozone - an important air pollutant that has an increasingly negative impact on crop yields, and thus global carbon fixation(1) and climate change(2). The aperture of stomatal pores is regulated by the transport of osmotically active ions and metabolites across guard cell membranes(3,4). Despite the vital role of guard cells in controlling plant water loss(3,4), ozone sensitivity(1,2) and CO2 supply(2,5-7), the genes encoding some of the main regulators of stomatal movements remain unknown. It has been proposed that guard cell anion channels function as important regulators of stomatal closure and are essential in mediating stomatal responses to physiological and stress stimuli(3,4,8). However, the genes encoding membrane proteins that mediate guard cell anion efflux have not yet been identified. Here we report the mapping and characterization of an ozone- sensitive Arabidopsis thaliana mutant, slac1. We show that SLAC1 ( SLOW ANION CHANNEL- ASSOCIATED 1) is preferentially expressed in guard cells and encodes a distant homologue of fungal and bacterial dicarboxylate/ malic acid transport proteins. The plasma membrane protein SLAC1 is essential for stomatal closure in response to CO2, abscisic acid, ozone, light/ dark transitions, humidity change, calcium ions, hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide. Mutations in SLAC1 impair slow ( S- type) anion channel currents that are activated by cytosolic Ca2(+) and abscisic acid, but do not affect rapid ( R- type) anion channel currents or Ca2+ channel function. A low homology of SLAC1 to bacterial and fungal organic acid transport proteins, and the permeability of S- type anion channels to malate(9) suggest a vital role for SLAC1 in the function of S- type anion channels.","Vahisalu, Triin; Kollist, Hannes; Wang, Yong-Fei; Nishimura, Noriyuki; Chan, Wai-Yin; Valerio, Gabriel; Lamminmaki, Airi; Brosche, Mikael; Moldau, Heino; Desikan, Radhika; Schroeder, Julian I.; Kangasjarvi, Jaakko","Vahisalu, T; Kollist, H; Wang, YF; Nishimura, N; Chan, WY; Valerio, G; Lamminmaki, A; Brosche, M; Moldau, H; Desikan, R; Schroeder, JI; Kangasjarvi, J",487.0,"[Vahisalu, Triin; Kollist, Hannes; Lamminmaki, Airi; Brosche, Mikael; Kangasjarvi, Jaakko] Univ Helsinki, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Vahisalu, Triin] Univ Tartu, Dept Bot, Inst Ecol & Earth Sci, EE-51005 Tartu, Estonia; [Kollist, Hannes; Moldau, Heino] Univ Tartu, Inst Technol, EE-50411 Tartu, Estonia; [Wang, Yong-Fei; Nishimura, Noriyuki; Chan, Wai-Yin; Valerio, Gabriel; Schroeder, Julian I.] Univ Calif San Diego, Div Biol Sci, Cell & Dev Biol Sect, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Desikan, Radhika] Univ W England, Ctr Res Plant Sci, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06608,Article,,jaakko.kangasjarvi@helsinki.fi,U15,"NIEHS NIH HHS [P42 ES010337, P42 ES010337-070008]; NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM060396, R01 GM060396-07]",,279FU,Y,N,ABSCISIC-ACID; PLASMA-MEMBRANE; ION CHANNELS; ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; VICIA-FABA; CLOSURE; OZONE; MUTANT; TRANSDUCTION,7186.0,NATURE,Nature,English,43.0,No,"Kangasjarvi, Jaakko/0000-0002-8959-1809; Brosche, Mikael/0000-0002-1135-2496; Kollist, Hannes/0000-0002-6895-3583; Schroeder, Julian/0000-0002-3283-5972; Lamminmaki, Airi/0000-0002-6133-8553","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",27-Mar,7.0,LONDON,18305484.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,"Nishimura, Noriyuki/E-3580-2010; Kangasjarvi, Jaakko/A-3024-2015; Brosche, Mikael/H-2260-2015; Kollist, Hannes/P-1548-2016","Kangasjarvi, J (reprint author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,331.0,SLAC1 is required for plant guard cell S-type anion channel function in stomatal signalling,4.0,109.0,WOS:000254341300035,440.0,452,Multidisciplinary Sciences,351,jaakko,kangasjarvi,12432.0,20,male,1.0,UovTahQAAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",29485561,1,na,0,Scandinavian Plant Physiology Society,na,0,0
113,205,336.0,"Although there has been considerable progress in the development of engineering principles for synthetic biology, a substantial challenge is the construction of robust circuits in a noisy cellular environment. Such an environment leads to considerable intercellular variability in circuit behaviour, which can hinder functionality at the colony level. Here we engineer the synchronization of thousands of oscillating colony 'biopixels' over centimetre-length scales through the use of synergistic intercellular coupling involving quorum sensing within a colony and gas-phase redox signalling between colonies. We use this platform to construct a liquid crystal display (LCD)-like macroscopic clock that can be used to sense arsenic via modulation of the oscillatory period. Given the repertoire of sensing capabilities of bacteria such as Escherichia coli, the ability to coordinate their behaviour over large length scales sets the stage for the construction of low cost genetic biosensors that are capable of detecting heavy metals and pathogens in the field.","Prindle, Arthur; Samayoa, Phillip; Razinkov, Ivan; Danino, Tal; Tsimring, Lev S.; Hasty, Jeff","Prindle, A; Samayoa, P; Razinkov, I; Danino, T; Tsimring, LS; Hasty, J",39.0,"[Prindle, Arthur; Razinkov, Ivan; Danino, Tal; Hasty, Jeff] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Bioengn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Samayoa, Phillip; Hasty, Jeff] Univ Calif San Diego, Bioinformat Program, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Tsimring, Lev S.; Hasty, Jeff] Univ Calif San Diego, BioCircuits Inst, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Hasty, Jeff] Univ Calif San Diego, Div Biol Sci, Mol Biol Sect, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10722,Article,,hasty@bioeng.ucsd.edu,44,National Institutes of Health and General Medicine [R01GM69811]; San Diego Center for Systems Biology [P50GM085764]; DoD NDSEG; NSF; Office of Naval Research [MURI N00014-07-0741],"This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health and General Medicine (R01GM69811), the San Diego Center for Systems Biology (P50GM085764), the DoD NDSEG (A.

114,149,264.0,"The appropriate timing of flowering is crucial for plant reproductive success. It is therefore not surprising that intricate genetic networks have evolved to perceive and integrate both endogenous and environmental signals, such as carbohydrate and hormonal status, photoperiod and temperature(1,2). In contrast to our detailed understanding of the vernalization pathway, little is known about how flowering time is controlled in response to changes in the ambient growth temperature. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the MADS-box transcription factor genes FLOWERING LOCUS M (FLM) and SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) have key roles in this process(3,4). FLM is subject to temperature-dependent alternative splicing(3). Here we report that the two main FLM protein splice variants, FLM-beta and FLM-delta, compete for interaction with the floral repressor SVP. The SVP-FLM-beta complex is predominately formed at low temperatures and prevents precocious flowering. By contrast, the competing SVP-FLM-delta complex is impaired in DNA binding and acts as a dominant-negative activator of flowering at higher temperatures. Our results show a new mechanism that controls the timing of the floral transition in response to changes in ambient temperature. A better understanding of how temperature controls the molecular mechanisms of flowering will be important to cope with current changes in global climate(5,6).","Pose, David; Verhage, Leonie; Ott, Felix; Yant, Levi; Mathieu, Johannes; Angenent, Gerco C.; Immink, Richard G.

115,167,80.0,"53BP1 (also called TP53BP1) is a chromatin-associated factor that promotes immunoglobulin class switching and DNA double-strand-break (DSB) repair by non-homologous end joining. To accomplish its function in DNA repair, 53BP1 accumulates at DSB sites downstream of the RNF168 ubiquitin ligase. How ubiquitin recruits 53BP1 to break sites remains unknown as its relocalization involves recognition of histone H4 Lys 20 (H4K20) methylation by its Tudor domain. Here we elucidate how vertebrate 53BP1 is recruited to the chromatin that flanks DSB sites. We show that 53BP1 recognizes mononucleosomes containing dimethylated H4K20 (H4K20me2) and H2A ubiquitinated on Lys 15 (H2AK15ub), the latter being a product of RNF168 action on chromatin. 53BP1 binds to nucleosomes minimally as a dimer using its previously characterized methyl-lysine-binding Tudor domain and a carboxy-terminal extension, termed the ubiquitination-dependent recruitment (UDR) motif, which interacts with the epitope formed by H2AK15ub and its surrounding residues on the H2A tail. 53BP1 is therefore a bivalent histone modification reader that recognizes a histone 'code' produced by DSB signalling.","Fradet-Turcotte, Amelie; Canny, Marella D.; Escribano-Diaz, Cristina; Orthwein, Alexandre; Leung, Charles C.

116,79,197.0,"Antagonistic interactions between hosts and parasites are a key structuring force in natural populations, driving coevolution(1,2). However, direct empirical evidence of long-term host-parasite coevolution, in particular `Red Queen' dynamics-in which antagonistic biotic interactions such as host-parasite interactions can lead to reciprocal evolutionary dynamics-is rare(3-5), and current data, although consistent with theories of antagonistic coevolution, do not reveal the temporal dynamics of the process(6). Dormant stages of both the water flea Daphnia and its microparasites are conserved in lake sediments, providing an archive of past gene pools. Here we use this fact to reconstruct rapid coevolutionary dynamics in a natural setting and show that the parasite rapidly adapts to its host over a period of only a few years. A coevolutionary model based on negative frequency-dependent selection, and designed to mimic essential aspects of our host parasite system, corroborated these experimental results. In line with the idea of continuing host-parasite coevolution, temporal variation in parasite infectivity changed little over time. In contrast, from the moment the parasite was first found in the sediments, we observed a steady increase in virulence over time, associated with higher fitness of the parasite.","Decaestecker, Ellen; Gaba, Sabrina; Raeymaekers, Joost A.

117,0,8.0,"During gene transcription, RNA polymerase (Pol) II moves forwards along DNA and synthesizes messenger RNA. However, at certain DNA sequences, Pol II moves backwards, and such backtracking can arrest transcription. Arrested Pol II is reactivated by transcription factor IIS (TFIIS), which induces RNA cleavage that is required for cell viability(1). Pol II arrest and reactivation are involved in transcription through nucleosomes(2,3) and in promoter-proximal gene regulation(4-6). Here we present X-ray structures at 3.3 angstrom resolution of an arrested Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pol II complex with DNA and RNA, and of a reactivation intermediate that additionally contains TFIIS. In the arrested complex, eight nucleotides of backtracked RNA bind a conserved 'backtrack site' in the Pol II pore and funnel, trapping the active centre trigger loop and inhibiting mRNA elongation. In the reactivation intermediate, TFIIS locks the trigger loop away from backtracked RNA, displaces RNA from the backtrack site, and complements the polymerase active site with a basic and two acidic residues that may catalyse proton transfers during RNA cleavage. The active site is demarcated from the backtrack site by a 'gating tyrosine' residue that probably delimits backtracking. These results establish the structural basis of Pol II backtracking, arrest and reactivation, and provide a framework for analysing gene regulation during transcription elongation.","Cheung, Alan C.

118,219,260.0,"The primate lentivirus auxiliary protein Vpx counteracts an unknown restriction factor that renders human dendritic and myeloid cells largely refractory to HIV-1 infection(1-6). Here we identify SAMHD1 as this restriction factor. SAMHD1 is a protein involved in Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome, a genetic encephalopathy with symptoms mimicking congenital viral infection, that has been proposed to act as a negative regulator of the interferon response(7). We show that Vpx induces proteasomal degradation of SAMHD1. Silencing of SAMHD1 in non-permissive cell lines alleviates HIV-1 restriction and is associated with a significant accumulation of viral DNA in infected cells. Concurrently, overexpression of SAMHD1 in sensitive cells inhibits HIV-1 infection. The putative phosphohydrolase activity of SAMHD1 is probably required for HIV-1 restriction. Vpx-mediated relief of restriction is abolished in SAMHD1-negative cells. Finally, silencing of SAMHD1 markedly increases the susceptibility of monocytic-derived dendritic cells to infection. Our results demonstrate that SAMHD1 is an antiretroviral protein expressed in cells of the myeloid lineage that inhibits an early step of the viral life cycle.","Laguette, Nadine; Sobhian, Bijan; Casartelli, Nicoletta; Ringeard, Mathieu; Chable-Bessia, Christine; Segeral, Emmanuel; Yatim, Ahmad; Emiliani, Stephane; Schwartz, Olivier; Benkirane, Monsef","Laguette, N; Sobhian, B; Casartelli, N; Ringeard, M; Chable-Bessia, C; Segeral, E; Yatim, A; Emiliani, S; Schwartz, O; Benkirane, M",654.0,"[Laguette, Nadine; Sobhian, Bijan; Ringeard, Mathieu; Chable-Bessia, Christine; Yatim, Ahmad; Benkirane, Monsef] CNRS, Inst Genet Humaine, Lab Virol Mol, UPR1142, F-34000 Montpellier, France; [Casartelli, Nicoletta; Schwartz, Olivier] CNRS, Inst Pasteur, Virus & Immun Unit, URA 3015, Paris, France; [Segeral, Emmanuel; Emiliani, Stephane] Univ Paris 05, CNRS, Inst Cochin, UMR 8104,INSERM,U567, Paris, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10117,Article,1476-4687,nadine.laguette@igh.cnrs.fr; monsef.benkirane@igh.cnrs.fr,U132,ERC [250333]; Sidaction; ANRS; FRM 'equipe labellisee'; CNRS/region Languedoc Roussillon; European FP7 [201412]; Institut Pasteur,"We wish to thank members of the Molecular Virology laboratory for critical reading of the manuscript, N.

119,155,337.0,"Super-luminous supernovae(1-4) that radiate more than 1044 ergs per second at their peak luminosity have recently been discovered in faint galaxies at redshifts of 0.1-4. Some evolve slowly, resembling models of 'pair-instability' supernovae(5,6). Such models involve stars with original masses 140-260 times that of the Sun that now have carbon-oxygen cores of 65-130 solar masses. In these stars, the photons that prevent gravitational collapse are converted to electron-positron pairs, causing rapid contraction and thermonuclear explosions. Many solar masses of Ni-56 are synthesized; this isotope decays to Fe-56 via Co-56, powering bright light curves(7,8). Such massive progenitors are expected to have formed from metal-poor gas in the early Universe(9). Recently, supernova 2007bi in a galaxy at redshift 0.127 (about 12 billion years after the Big Bang) with a metallicity one-third that of the Sun was observed to look like a fading pair-instability supernova(1,10). Here we report observations of two slow-to-fade super-luminous supernovae that show relatively fast rise times and blue colours, which are incompatible with pair-instability models. Their late-time light-curve and spectral similarities to supernova 2007bi call the nature of that event into question. Our early spectra closely resemble typical fast-declining super-luminous supernovae(2,11,12), which are not powered by radio-activity. Modelling our observations with 10-16 solar masses of magnetar-energized(13,14) ejecta demonstrates the possibility of a common explosion mechanism. The lack of unambiguous nearby pair-instability events suggests that their local rate of occurrence is less than 6 x 10(-6) times that of the core-collapse rate.","Nicholl, M.; Smartt, S.

120,214,490.0,"Technological advances in DNA recovery and sequencing have drastically expanded the scope of genetic analyses of ancient specimens to the extent that full genomic investigations are now feasible and are quickly becoming standard(1). This trend has important implications for infectious disease research because genomic data from ancient microbes may help to elucidate mechanisms of pathogen evolution and adaptation for emerging and re-emerging infections. Here we report a reconstructed ancient genome of Yersinia pestis at 30-fold average coverage from Black Death victims securely dated to episodes of pestilence-associated mortality in London, England, 1348-1350. Genetic architecture and phylogenetic analysis indicate that the ancient organismis ancestral to most extant strains and sits very close to the ancestral node of all Y. pestis commonly associated with human infection. Temporal estimates suggest that the Black Death of 1347-1351 was the main historical event responsible for the introduction and widespread dissemination of the ancestor to all currently circulating Y. pestis strains pathogenic to humans, and further indicates that contemporary Y. pestis epidemics have their origins in the medieval era. Comparisons against modern genomes reveal no unique derived positions in the medieval organism, indicating that the perceived increased virulence of the disease during the Black Death may not have been due to bacterial phenotype. These findings support the notion that factors other than microbial genetics, such as environment, vector dynamics and host susceptibility, should be at the forefront of epidemiological discussions regarding emerging Y. pestis infections.","Bos, Kirsten I.; Schuenemann, Verena J.; Golding, G.

121,112,60.0,"Overflow metabolism refers to the seemingly wasteful strategy in which cells use fermentation instead of the more efficient respiration to generate energy, despite the availability of oxygen. Known as the Warburg effect in the context of cancer growth, this phenomenon occurs ubiquitously for fast-growing cells, including bacteria, fungi and mammalian cells, but its origin has remained unclear despite decades of research. Here we study metabolic overflow in Escherichia coli, and show that it is a global physiological response used to cope with changing proteomic demands of energy biogenesis and biomass synthesis under different growth conditions. A simple model of proteomic resource allocation can quantitatively account for all of the observed behaviours, and accurately predict responses to new perturbations. The key hypothesis of the model, that the proteome cost of energy biogenesis by respiration exceeds that by fermentation, is quantitatively confirmed by direct measurement of protein abundances via quantitative mass spectrometry.","Basan, Markus; Hui, Sheng; Okano, Hiroyuki; Zhang, Zhongge; Shen, Yang; Williamson, James R.; Hwa, Terence","Basan, M; Hui, S; Okano, H; Zhang, ZG; Shen, Y; Williamson, JR; Hwa, T",99.0,"[Basan, Markus; Hui, Sheng; Okano, Hiroyuki; Hwa, Terence] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Phys, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Basan, Markus] ETH, Inst Mol Syst Biol, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Okano, Hiroyuki; Zhang, Zhongge; Shen, Yang; Hwa, Terence] Univ Calif San Diego, Mol Biol Sect, Div Biol Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Williamson, James R.] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Chem, Skaggs Inst Chem Biol, Dept Integrat Struct & Computat Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Hwa, Terence] ETH, Inst Theoret Studies, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15765,Article,1476-4687,hwa@ucsd.edu,+,"NIH [R01-GM109069]; Simons Foundation [330378]; M.

122,136,385.0,"Sequencing DNA from several organisms has revealed that duplication and drift of existing genes have primarily moulded the contents of a given genome. Though the effect of knocking out or overexpressing a particular gene has been studied in many organisms, no study has systematically explored the effect of adding new links in a biological network. To explore network evolvability, we constructed 598 recombinations of promoters ( including regulatory regions) with different transcription or sigma-factor genes in Escherichia coli, added over a wild- type genetic background. Here we show that similar to 95% of new networks are tolerated by the bacteria, that very few alter growth, and that expression level correlates with factor position in the wild- type network hierarchy. Most importantly, we find that certain networks consistently survive over the wild type under various selection pressures. Therefore new links in the network are rarely a barrier for evolution and can even confer a fitness advantage.","Isalan, Mark; Lemerle, Caroline; Michalodimitrakis, Konstantinos; Horn, Carsten; Beltrao, Pedro; Raineri, Emanuele; Garriga-Canut, Mireia; Serrano, Luis","Isalan, M; Lemerle, C; Michalodimitrakis, K; Horn, C; Beltrao, P; Raineri, E; Garriga-Canut, M; Serrano, L",840.0,"[Isalan, Mark; Michalodimitrakis, Konstantinos; Raineri, Emanuele; Garriga-Canut, Mireia; Serrano, Luis] UPF, CRG, EMBL, CRG Syst Biol, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Lemerle, Caroline; Horn, Carsten; Beltrao, Pedro] European Mol Biol Lab, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06847,Article,1476-4687,isalan@crg.es,U2,Wellcome Trust [066543],,288ZY,,,ESCHERICHIA-COLI K-12; TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATORY NETWORKS; OPERON ORGANIZATION; BIOFILM FORMATION; EXPRESSION; GROWTH; TOLERANCE; EVOLUTION; RPOS; TYPHIMURIUM,7189.0,NATURE,Nature,English,45.0,No,"Serrano, Luis/0000-0002-5276-1392; Beltrao, Pedro/0000-0002-2724-7703","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",17-Apr,7.0,LONDON,18421347.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,"Beltrao, Pedro/B-3342-2010; Serrano, Luis/B-3355-2013","Isalan, M (reprint author), UPF, CRG, EMBL, CRG Syst Biol, Barcelona 08003, Spain.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,186.0,Evolvability and hierarchy in rewired bacterial gene networks,1.0,32.0,WOS:000255026000041,385.0,452,Multidisciplinary Sciences,192,luis,serrano,50682.0,4053,male,1.0,D1EHFZQAAAAJ,5,"(17929, ]",36036328,1,372766,1,Ángel Luis Fernández Serrano,Ángel Luis Fernández Serrano,1,1
123,383,120.0,"In mitosis, the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) ensures genome stability by delaying chromosome segregation until all sister chromatids have achieved bipolar attachment to the mitotic spindle. The SAC is imposed by the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC), whose assembly is catalysed by unattached chromosomes and which binds and inhibits the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), the E3 ubiquitin ligase that initiates chromosome segregation. Here, using the crystal structure of Schizosaccharomyces pombe MCC(a complex of mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint proteins Mad2, Mad3 and APC/C co-activator protein Cdc20), we reveal the molecular basis of MCC-mediated APC/C inhibition and the regulation of MCC assembly. The MCC inhibits the APC/C by obstructing degron recognition sites on Cdc20 (the substrate recruitment subunit of the APC/C) and displacing Cdc20 to disrupt formation of a bipartite D-box receptor with the APC/C subunit Apc10. Mad2, in the closed conformation (C-Mad2), stabilizes the complex by optimally positioning the Mad3 KEN-box degron to bind Cdc20. Mad3 and p31(comet) (also known as MAD2L1-binding protein) compete for the same C-Mad2 interface, which explains how p31(comet) disrupts MCC assembly to antagonize the SAC. This study shows how APC/C inhibition is coupled to degron recognition by co-activators.","Chao, William C.

124,30,485.0,"Remarkable progress in optical microscopy has been made in the measurement of nanometre distances. If diffraction blurs the image of a point object into an Airy disk with a root-mean-squared (r.m.s.) size of s = 0.44 lambda/2NA (similar to 90 nm for light with a wavelength of lambda = 600 nm and an objective lens with a numerical aperture of NA = 1.49), limiting the resolution of the far-field microscope in use to d = 2.4s approximate to 200 nm, additional knowledge about the specimen can be used to great advantage. For example, if the source is known to be two spatially resolved fluorescent molecules, the distance between them is given by the separation of the centres of the two fluorescence images(1). In high-resolution microwave and optical spectroscopy, there are numerous examples where the line centre is determined with a precision of less than 10(-6) of the linewidth. In contrast, in biological applications the brightest single fluorescent emitters can be detected with a signal-to-noise ratio of similar to 100, limiting the centroid localization precision to s(loc) >= 1% (>= 1 nm) of the r.m.s. size, s, of the microscope point spread function (PSF)(2). Moreover, the error in co-localizing two or more single emitters is notably worse, remaining greater than 5-10% (5-10 nm) of the PSF size(3-8). Here we report a distance resolution of s(reg) = 0.50 nm (1 sigma) and an absolute accuracy of s(distance) = 0.77 nm (1 sigma) in a measurement of the separation between differently coloured fluorescent molecules using conventional far-field fluorescence imaging in physiological buffer conditions. The statistical uncertainty in the mean for an ensemble of identical single-molecule samples is limited only by the total number of collected photons, to s(loc) approximate to 0.3 nm, which is similar to 3 x 10(-3) times the size of the optical PSF. Our method may also be used to improve the resolution of many subwavelength, far-field imaging methods such as those based on co-localization of molecules that are stochastically switched on in space(6-8). The improved resolution will allow the structure of large, multisubunit biological complexes in biologically relevant environments to be deciphered at the single-molecule level.","Pertsinidis, Alexandros; Zhang, Yunxiang; Chu, Steven","Pertsinidis, A; Zhang, YX; Chu, S",647.0,"[Pertsinidis, Alexandros; Zhang, Yunxiang; Chu, Steven] Stanford Univ, Dept Phys, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Pertsinidis, Alexandros; Zhang, Yunxiang; Chu, Steven] Univ Calif Berkeley, Calif Inst Quantitat Biosci QB3, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Chu, Steven] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Chu, Steven] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Chu, Steven] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09163,Article,,pertsin@berkeley.edu; the.secretary@hq.doe.gov,U11,National Institutes of Health; National Science Foundation; National Aeronautics and Space Administration; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency,"A.P. wishes to thank S.

125,217,147.0,"Top-down prefrontal cortex inputs to the hippocampus have been hypothesized to be important in memory consolidation, retrieval, and the pathophysiology of major psychiatric diseases; however, no such direct projections have been identified and functionally described. Here we report the discovery of a monosynaptic prefrontal cortex (predominantly anterior cingulate) to hippocampus (CA3 to CA1 region) projection in mice, and find that optogenetic manipulation of this projection (here termed AC-CA) is capable of eliciting contextual memory retrieval. To explore the network mechanisms of this process, we developed and applied tools to observe cellular-resolution neural activity in the hippocampus while stimulating AC-CA projections during memory retrieval in mice behaving in virtual-reality environments. Using this approach, we found that learning drives the emergence of a sparse class of neurons in CA2/CA3 that are highly correlated with the local network and that lead synchronous population activity events; these neurons are then preferentially recruited by the AC-CA projection during memory retrieval. These findings reveal a sparsely implemented memory retrieval mechanism in the hippocampus that operates via direct top-down prefrontal input, with implications for the patterning and storage of salient memory representations.","Rajasethupathy, Priyamvada; Sankaran, Sethuraman; Marshel, James H.; Kim, Christina K.; Ferenczi, Emily; Lee, Soo Yeun; Berndt, Andre; Ramakrishnan, Charu; Jaffe, Anna; Lo, Maisie; Liston, Conor; Deisseroth, Karl","Rajasethupathy, P; Sankaran, S; Marshel, JH; Kim, CK; Ferenczi, E; Lee, SY; Berndt, A; Ramakrishnan, C; Jaffe, A; Lo, M; Liston, C; Deisseroth, K",653.0,"[Rajasethupathy, Priyamvada; Marshel, James H.; Kim, Christina K.; Ferenczi, Emily; Lee, Soo Yeun; Berndt, Andre; Ramakrishnan, Charu; Jaffe, Anna; Lo, Maisie; Liston, Conor; Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Dept Bioengn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Rajasethupathy, Priyamvada; Sankaran, Sethuraman; Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, CNC Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kim, Christina K.; Ferenczi, Emily; Lee, Soo Yeun; Berndt, Andre] Stanford Univ, Neurosci Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Liston, Conor; Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15389,Article,1476-4687,deissero@stanford.edu,659,"Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Neuro-FAST program; National Institute of Mental Health, National Science Foundation; National Institute on Drug Abuse, National Science Foundation; Simons Foundation; Tarlton Foundation; Wiegers Family Fund; Nancy and James Grosfeld Foundation; H.L.

126,48,229.0,"Most heritable traits, including many human diseases(1), are caused by multiple loci. Studies in both humans and model organisms, such as yeast, have failed to detect a large fraction of the loci that underlie such complex traits(2,3). A lack of statistical power to identify multiple loci with small effects is undoubtedly one of the primary reasons for this problem. We have developed a method in yeast that allows the use of much larger sample sizes than previously possible and hence permits the detection of multiple loci with small effects. The method involves generating very large numbers of progeny from a cross between two Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains and then phenotyping and genotyping pools of these offspring. We applied the method to 17 chemical resistance traits and mitochondrial function, and identified loci for each of these phenotypes. We show that the level of genetic complexity underlying these quantitative traits is highly variable, with some traits influenced by one major locus and others by at least 20 loci. Our results provide an empirical demonstration of the genetic complexity of a number of traits and show that it is possible to identify many of the underlying factors using straightforward techniques. Our method should have broad applications in yeast and can be extended to other organisms.","Ehrenreich, Ian M.; Torabi, Noorossadat; Jia, Yue; Kent, Jonathan; Martis, Stephen; Shapiro, Joshua A.; Gresham, David; Caudy, Amy A.; Kruglyak, Leonid","Ehrenreich, IM; Torabi, N; Jia, Y; Kent, J; Martis, S; Shapiro, JA; Gresham, D; Caudy, AA; Kruglyak, L",1039.0,"[Ehrenreich, Ian M.; Torabi, Noorossadat; Jia, Yue; Kent, Jonathan; Martis, Stephen; Shapiro, Joshua A.; Gresham, David; Caudy, Amy A.; Kruglyak, Leonid] Princeton Univ, Lewis Sigler Inst Integrat Genom, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Ehrenreich, Ian M.; Shapiro, Joshua A.; Kruglyak, Leonid] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Ehrenreich, Ian M.; Jia, Yue; Shapiro, Joshua A.; Kruglyak, Leonid] Princeton Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Torabi, Noorossadat] Princeton Univ, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08923,Article,1476-4687,leonid@genomics.princeton.edu,U101,"NIH [R37 MH59520, F32 HG51762, P50 GM071508]; James S.

127,278,118.0,"Although a few cancer genes are mutated in a high proportion of tumours of a given type (>20%), most are mutated at intermediate frequencies (2-20%). To explore the feasibility of creating a comprehensive catalogue of cancer genes, we analysed somatic point mutations in exome sequences from 4,742 human cancers and their matched normal-tissue samples across 21 cancer types. We found that large-scale genomic analysis can identify nearly all known cancer genes in these tumour types. Our analysis also identified 33 genes that were not previously known to be significantly mutated in cancer, including genes related to proliferation, apoptosis, genome stability, chromatin regulation, immune evasion, RNA processing and protein homeostasis. Down-sampling analysis indicates that larger sample sizes will reveal many more genes mutated at clinically important frequencies. We estimate that near-saturation may be achieved with 6005,000 samples per tumour type, depending on background mutation frequency. The results may help to guide the next stage of cancer genomics.","Lawrence, Michael S.; Stojanov, Petar; Mermel, Craig H.; Robinson, James T.; Garraway, Levi A.; Golub, Todd R.; Meyerson, Matthew; Gabriel, Stacey B.; Lander, Eric S.; Getz, Gad","Lawrence, MS; Stojanov, P; Mermel, CH; Robinson, JT; Garraway, LA; Golub, TR; Meyerson, M; Gabriel, SB; Lander, ES; Getz, G",495.0,"[Lawrence, Michael S.; Stojanov, Petar; Mermel, Craig H.; Robinson, James T.; Garraway, Levi A.; Golub, Todd R.; Meyerson, Matthew; Gabriel, Stacey B.; Lander, Eric S.; Getz, Gad] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge Ctr 7, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Stojanov, Petar; Garraway, Levi A.; Golub, Todd R.; Meyerson, Matthew] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Mermel, Craig H.; Getz, Gad] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Canc, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Mermel, Craig H.; Getz, Gad] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Garraway, Levi A.; Golub, Todd R.; Meyerson, Matthew; Lander, Eric S.; Getz, Gad] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Golub, Todd R.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chevy Chase, MD 20815 USA; [Lander, Eric S.] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12912,Article,1476-4687,lander@broadinstitute.org; gadgetz@broadinstitute.org,+,Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NCI NIH HHS [R01 CA157304]; NHGRI NIH HHS [U54 HG003067]; NIGMS NIH HHS [T32 GM007753],,293SW,Y,N,MUTATIONS; HALLMARKS; GENOME,7484.0,NATURE,Nature,English,13.0,No,"Meyerson, Matthew/0000-0002-9133-8108","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",23-Jan,9.0,LONDON,24390350.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2014.0,,"Lander, ES (reprint author), Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge Ctr 7, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,871.0,Discovery and saturation analysis of cancer genes across 21 tumour types,15.0,191.0,WOS:000329995000029,118.0,505,Multidisciplinary Sciences,885,gad,getz,92290.0,13,male,1.0,q-KRzawAAAAJ,5,"(17929, ]",35304421,1,15181775,1,Jobs (film),Jobs (film),0,0
128,162,160.0,"Recent advances in measuring gene expression at the single- cell level have highlighted the stochastic nature of messenger RNA and protein synthesis(1-3). Stochastic gene expression creates a source of variability in the abundance of cellular components, even among isogenic cells exposed to an identical environment. Recent integrated experimental and modelling studies(4-13) have shed light on the molecular sources of this variability. However, many of these studies focus on systems that have reached a steady state and therefore do not address a large class of dynamic phenomena including oscillatory gene expression. Here we develop a general protocol for analysing and predicting stochastic gene expression in systems that never reach steady states. We use this framework to analyse experimentally stochastic expression of genes driven by the Synechococcus elongatus circadian clock. We find that, although the average expression at two points in the circadian cycle separated by 12 hours is identical, the variability at these two time points can be different. We show that this is a general feature of out- of- steady- state systems. We demonstrate how intrinsic noise sources, owing to random births and deaths of mRNAs and proteins, or extrinsic noise sources, which introduce fluctuations in rate constants, affect the cell- to- cell variability. To distinguish experimentally between these sources, we measured how the correlation between expression fluctuations of two identical genes is modulated during the circadian cycle. This quantitative framework is generally applicable to any out- of steady state system and will be necessary for understanding the fidelity of dynamic cellular systems.","Chabot, Jeffrey R.; Pedraza, Juan M.; Luitel, Prashant; van Oudenaarden, Alexander","Chabot, JR; Pedraza, JM; Luitel, P; van Oudenaarden, A",1249.0,"MIT, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; MIT, George R Harrison Spect Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06395,Article,,avano@mit.edu,1252,,,243HA,,,SINGLE-CELL; PROTEIN EXPRESSION; NOISE; RHYTHMS; VARIABILITY; NETWORKS; LUCIFERASE; REPORTER; ORIGINS; LEVEL,7173.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",20-Dec,4.0,LONDON,18097413.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007.0,,"van Oudenaarden, A (reprint author), MIT, Dept Phys, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,71.0,Stochastic gene expression out-of-steady-state in the cyanobacterial circadian clock,1.0,9.0,WOS:000251786200054,160.0,450,Multidisciplinary Sciences,72,alexander,van oudenaarden,26343.0,1645,male,1.0,pxkP0GQAAAAJ,5,"(17929, ]",17509366,1,17509366,1,Alexander van Oudenaarden,Alexander van Oudenaarden,1,1
129,72,431.0,"Using next-generation sequencing technology alone, we have successfully generated and assembled a draft sequence of the giant panda genome. The assembled contigs (2.25 gigabases (Gb)) cover approximately 94% of the whole genome, and the remaining gaps (0.05 Gb) seem to contain carnivore-specific repeats and tandem repeats. Comparisons with the dog and human showed that the panda genome has a lower divergence rate. The assessment of panda genes potentially underlying some of its unique traits indicated that its bamboo diet might be more dependent on its gut microbiome than its own genetic composition. We also identified more than 2.7 million heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms in the diploid genome. Our data and analyses provide a foundation for promoting mammalian genetic research, and demonstrate the feasibility for using next-generation sequencing technologies for accurate, cost-effective and rapid de novo assembly of large eukaryotic genomes.","Li, Ruiqiang;

130,199,329.0,"Methylation of lysine and arginine residues on histone tails affects chromatin structure and gene transcription(1-3). Tri- and dimethylation of lysine 9 on histone H3 (H3K9me3/me2) is required for the binding of the repressive protein HP1 and is associated with heterochromatin formation and transcriptional repression in a variety of species(4-6). H3K9me3 has long been regarded as a 'permanent' epigenetic mark(7,8). In a search for proteins and complexes interacting with H3K9me3, we identified the protein GASC1 ( gene amplified in squamous cell carcinoma 1)(9), which belongs to the JMJD2 ( jumonji domain containing 2) subfamily of the jumonji family, and is also known as JMJD2C(10). Here we show that three members of this subfamily of proteins demethylate H3K9me3/me2 in vitro through a hydroxylation reaction requiring iron and alpha-ketoglutarate as cofactors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ectopic expression of GASC1 or other JMJD2 members markedly decreases H3K9me3/me2 levels, increases H3K9me1 levels, delocalizes HP1 and reduces heterochromatin in vivo. Previously, GASC1 was found to be amplified in several cell lines derived from oesophageal squamous carcinomas(9,11,12), and in agreement with a contribution of GASC1 to tumour development, inhibition of GASC1 expression decreases cell proliferation. Thus, in addition to identifying GASC1 as a histone trimethyl demethylase, we suggest a model for how this enzyme might be involved in cancer development, and propose it as a target for anti-cancer therapy.","Cloos, Paul A.

131,141,448.0,"Viruses, and more particularly phages ( viruses that infect bacteria), represent one of the most abundant living entities in aquatic and terrestrial environments. The biogeography of phages has only recently been investigated and so far reveals a cosmopolitan distribution of phage genetic material ( or genotypes)(1-4). Here we address this cosmopolitan distribution through the analysis of phage communities in modern microbialites, the living representatives of one of the most ancient life forms on Earth. On the basis of a comparative metagenomic analysis of viral communities associated with marine ( Highborne Cay, Bahamas) and freshwater ( Pozas Azules II and Rio Mesquites, Mexico) microbialites, we show that some phage genotypes are geographically restricted. The high percentage of unknown sequences recovered from the three metagenomes (>97%), the low percentage similarities with sequences from other environmental viral ( n = 42) and microbial ( n = 36) metagenomes, and the absence of viral genotypes shared among microbialites indicate that viruses are genetically unique in these environments. Identifiable sequences in the Highborne Cay metagenome were dominated by single- stranded DNA microphages that were not detected in any other samples examined, including sea water, fresh water, sediment, terrestrial, extreme, metazoan- associated and marine microbial mats. Finally, a marine signature was present in the phage community of the Pozas Azules II microbialites, even though this environment has not been in contact with the ocean for tens of millions of years. Taken together, these results prove that viruses in modern microbialites display biogeographical variability and suggest that they may be derived from an ancient community.","Desnues, Christelle; Rodriguez-Brito, Beltran; Rayhawk, Steve; Kelley, Scott; Tran, Tuong; Haynes, Matthew; Liu, Hong; Furlan, Mike; Wegley, Linda; Chau, Betty; Ruan, Yijun; Hall, Dana; Angly, Florent E.; Edwards, Robert A.; Li, Linlin; Thurber, Rebecca Vega; Reid, R.

132,289,310.0,"Kramers developed the theory on how chemical reaction rates are influenced by the viscosity of the medium(1,2). At the viscosity of water, the kinetics of unimolecular reactions are described by diffusion of a Brownian particle over a free-energy barrier separating reactants and products. For reactions in solution this famous theory extended Eyring's transition state theory, and is widely applied in physics, chemistry and biology, including to reactions as complex as protein folding(3,4). Because the diffusion coefficient of Kramers' theory is determined by the dynamics in the sparsely populated region of the barrier top, its properties have not been directly measured for any molecular system. Here we show that the Kramers diffusion coefficient and free-energy barrier can be characterized by measuring the temperature- and viscosity-dependence of the transition path time for protein folding. The transition path is the small fraction of an equilibrium trajectory for a single molecule when the free-energy barrier separating two states is actually crossed. Its duration, the transition path time, can now be determined from photon trajectories for single protein molecules undergoing folding/unfolding transitions(5). Our finding of a long transition path time with an unusually small solvent viscosity dependence suggests that internal friction as well as solvent friction determine the Kramers diffusion coefficient for alpha-helical proteins, as opposed to a breakdown of his theory, which occurs for many small-molecule reactions(2). It is noteworthy that the new and fundamental information concerning Kramers' theory and the dynamics of barrier crossings obtained here come from experiments on a protein rather than a much simpler chemical or physical system.","Chung, Hoi Sung; Eaton, William A.","Chung, HS; Eaton, WA",685.0,"[Chung, Hoi Sung; Eaton, William A.] NIDDK, Chem Phys Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12649,Article,1476-4687,chunghoi@niddk.nih.gov; eaton@helix.nih.gov,+,"Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health","We are particularly indebted to J.

133,184,423.0,"Quantum information science involves the storage, manipulation and communication of information encoded in quantum systems, where the phenomena of superposition and entanglement can provide enhancements over what is possible classically(1,2). Large-scale quantum information processors require stable and addressable quantum memories, usually in the form of fixed quantum bits ( qubits), and a means of transferring and entangling the quantum information between memories that may be separated by macroscopic or even geographic distances. Atomic systems are excellent quantum memories, because appropriate internal electronic states can coherently store qubits over very long timescales. Photons, on the other hand, are the natural platform for the distribution of quantum information between remote qubits, given their ability to traverse large distances with little perturbation. Recently, there has been considerable progress in coupling small samples of atomic gases through photonic channels(2,3), including the entanglement between light and atoms(4,5) and the observation of entanglement signatures between remotely located atomic ensembles(6) (-8). In contrast to atomic ensembles, single-atom quantum memories allow the implementation of conditional quantum gates through photonic channels2,9, a key requirement for quantum computing. Along these lines, individual atoms have been coupled to photons in cavities(2,10-12), and trapped atoms have been linked to emitted photons in free space(13-17). Here we demonstrate the entanglement of two fixed single-atom quantum memories separated by one metre. Two remotely located trapped atomic ions each emit a single photon, and the interference and detection of these photons signals the entanglement of the atomic qubits. We characterize the entangled pair by directly measuring qubit correlations with near-perfect detection efficiency. Although this entanglement method is probabilistic, it is still in principle useful for subsequent quantum operations and scalable quantum information applications(18-20).","Moehring, D.

134,269,479.0,"Enhancers control the correct temporal and cell-type-specific activation of gene expression in multicellular eukaryotes. Knowing their properties, regulatory activity and targets is crucial to understand the regulation of differentiation and homeostasis. Here we use the FANTOM5 panel of samples, covering the majority of human tissues and cell types, to produce an atlas of active, in vivo-transcribed enhancers. We show that enhancers share properties with CpG-poor messenger RNA promoters but produce bidirectional, exosome-sensitive, relatively short unspliced RNAs, the generation of which is strongly related to enhancer activity. The atlas is used to compare regulatory programs between different cells at unprecedented depth, to identify disease-associated regulatory single nucleotide polymorphisms, and to classify cell-type-specific and ubiquitous enhancers. We further explore the utility of enhancer redundancy, which explains gene expression strength rather than expression patterns. The online FANTOM5 enhancer atlas represents a unique resource for studies on cell-type-specific enhancers and gene regulation.","Andersson, Robin; Gebhard, Claudia; Miguel-Escalada, Irene; Hoof, Ilka; Bornholdt, Jette; Boyd, Mette; Chen, Yun; Zhao, Xiaobei; Schmidl, Christian; Suzuki, Takahiro; Ntini, Evgenia; Arner, Erik; Valen, Eivind; Li, Kang; Schwarzfischer, Lucia; Glatz, Dagmar; Raithel, Johanna; Lilje, Berit; Rapin, Nicolas; Bagger, Frederik Otzen; Jorgensen, Mette; Andersen, Peter Refsing; Bertin, Nicolas; Rackham, Owen; Burroughs, A.

135,144,0.0,"A half- century after the determination of the first three-dimensional crystal structure of a protein(1), more than 40,000 structures ranging from single polypeptides to large assemblies have been reported(2). The challenge for crystallographers, however, remains the growing of a diffracting crystal. Here we report the 4.5- angstrom resolution structure of a 22-MDa macromolecular assembly, the capsid of the infectious epsilon15 ( epsilon 15) particle, by single-particle electron cryomicroscopy. From this density map we constructed a complete backbone trace of its major capsid protein, gene product 7 ( gp7). The structure reveals a similar protein architecture to that of other tailed double- stranded DNA viruses, even in the absence of detectable sequence similarity(3,4). However, the connectivity of the secondary structure elements ( topology) in gp7 is unique. Protruding densities are observed around the two- fold axes that cannot be accounted for by gp7. A subsequent proteomic analysis of the whole virus identifies these densities as gp10, a 12- kDa protein. Its structure, location and high binding affinity to the capsid indicate that the gp10 dimer functions as a molecular staple between neighbouring capsomeres to ensure the particle's stability. Beyond epsilon 15, this method potentially offers a new approach for modelling the backbone conformations of the protein subunits in other macromolecular assemblies at near- native solution states.","Jiang, Wen; Baker, Matthew L.; Jakana, Joanita; Weigele, Peter R.; King, Jonathan; Chiu, Wah","Jiang, W; Baker, ML; Jakana, J; Weigele, PR; King, J; Chiu, W",1130.0,"[Baker, Matthew L.; Jakana, Joanita; Chiu, Wah] Baylor Coll Med, Natl Ctr Macromol Imaging, Verna & Marrs Mclean Dept Biochem, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Jiang, Wen] Purdue Univ, Markey Ctr Struct Biol, Dept Biol Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Weigele, Peter R.; King, Jonathan] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06665,Article,1476-4687,jiang12@purdue.edu; wah@bcm.edu,U12,,,266RB,,,DENSITY MAPS; PROTEIN; VIRUSES; BACTERIOPHAGES; MICROSCOPY; PARTICLES; ALGORITHM; EVOLUTION; TOPOLOGY; BINDING,7182.0,NATURE,Nature,English,35.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",28-Feb,6.0,LONDON,18305544.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,,"Chiu, W (reprint author), Baylor Coll Med, Natl Ctr Macromol Imaging, Verna & Marrs Mclean Dept Biochem, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,150.0,Backbone structure of the infectious epsilon 15 virus capsid revealed by electron cryomicroscopy,1.0,13.0,WOS:000253453600047,0.0,451,Multidisciplinary Sciences,157,wah,chiu,23821.0,19,male,0.95,QgGaAdsAAAAJ,5,"(17929, ]",53855890,1,52428289,1,Wah Chiu,Wah Chiu,1,1
136,372,470.0,"The modification of DNA by 5-methylcytosine (5mC) has essential roles in cell differentiation and development through epigenetic gene regulation(1). 5mC can be converted to another modified base, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), by the tet methylcytosine dioxygenase (Tet) family of enzymes(2,3). Notably, the balance between 5hmC and 5mC in the genome is linked with cell-differentiation processes such as pluripotency and lineage commitment(4-7). We have previously reported that the maternal factor PGC7 (also known as Dppa3, Stella) is required for the maintenance of DNA methylation in early embryogenesis, and protects 5mC from conversion to 5hmC in the maternal genome(8,9). Here we show that PGC7 protects 5mC from Tet3-mediated conversion to 5hmC by binding to maternal chromatin containing dimethylated histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2) in mice. In addition, imprinted loci that are marked with H3K9me2 in mature sperm are protected by PGC7 binding in early embryogenesis. This type of regulatory mechanism could be involved in DNA modifications in somatic cells as well as in early embryos.","Nakamura, Toshinobu; Liu, Yu-Jung; Nakashima, Hiroyuki; Umehara, Hiroki; Inoue, Kimiko; Matoba, Shogo; Tachibana, Makoto; Ogura, Atsuo; Shinkai, Yoichi; Nakano, Toru","Nakamura, T; Liu, YJ; Nakashima, H; Umehara, H; Inoue, K; Matoba, S; Tachibana, M; Ogura, A; Shinkai, Y; Nakano, T",415.0,"[Liu, Yu-Jung; Nakashima, Hiroyuki; Umehara, Hiroki] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Frontier Biosci, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Nakamura, Toshinobu; Nakano, Toru] Osaka Univ, Dept Pathol, Grad Sch Med, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Inoue, Kimiko; Matoba, Shogo; Ogura, Atsuo] RIKEN BioResouce Ctr, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050074, Japan; [Tachibana, Makoto; Shinkai, Yoichi] Kyoto Univ, Expt Res Ctr Infect Dis, Inst Virus Res, Kyoto 6068507, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11093,Article,,tnakamura@nagahama-i-bio.ac.jp; tnakano@patho.med.osaka-u.ac.jp,+,"Ministry of Education, Science, Sports, Culture and Technology of Japan","We thank M.

137,11,195.0,"Glioblastoma is a highly angiogenetic malignancy, the neoformed vessels of which are thought to arise by sprouting of pre-existing brain capillaries. The recent demonstration that a population of glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) maintains glioblastomas(1,2) indicates that the progeny of these cells may not be confined to the neural lineage(3). Normal neural stem cells are able to differentiate into functional endothelial cells(4). The connection between neural stem cells and the endothelial compartment seems to be critical in glioblastoma, where cancer stem cells closely interact with the vascular niche and promote angiogenesis through the release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and stromal-derived factor 1 (refs 5-9). Here we show that a variable number (range 20-90%, mean 60.7%) of endothelial cells in glioblastoma carry the same genomic alteration as tumour cells, indicating that a significant portion of the vascular endothelium has a neoplastic origin. The vascular endothelium contained a subset of tumorigenic cells that produced highly vascularized anaplastic tumours with areas of vasculogenic mimicry in immunocompromised mice. In vitro culture of GSCs in endothelial conditions generated progeny with phenotypic and functional features of endothelial cells. Likewise, orthotopic or subcutaneous injection of GSCs in immunocompromised mice produced tumour xenografts, the vessels of which were primarily composed of human endothelial cells. Selective targeting of endothelial cells generated by GSCs in mouse xenografts resulted in tumour reduction and degeneration, indicating the functional relevance of the GSC-derived endothelial vessels. These findings describe a new mechanism for tumour vasculogenesis and may explain the presence of cancer-derived endothelial-like cells in several malignancies.","Ricci-Vitiani, Lucia; Pallini, Roberto; Biffoni, Mauro; Todaro, Matilde; Invernici, Gloria; Cenci, Tonia; Maira, Giulio; Parati, Eugenio Agostino; Stassi, Giorgio; Larocca, Luigi Maria; De Maria, Ruggero","Ricci-Vitiani, L; Pallini, R; Biffoni, M; Todaro, M; Invernici, G; Cenci, T; Maira, G; Parati, EA; Stassi, G; Larocca, LM; De Maria, R",824.0,"[Ricci-Vitiani, Lucia; Biffoni, Mauro; De Maria, Ruggero] Ist Super Sanita, Dept Hematol Oncol & Mol Med, I-00161 Rome, Italy; [Pallini, Roberto; Maira, Giulio] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Neurosurg, I-00168 Rome, Italy; [Todaro, Matilde; Stassi, Giorgio] Univ Palermo, Dept Surg & Oncol Sci, I-90127 Palermo, Italy; [Invernici, Gloria; Parati, Eugenio Agostino] Neurol Inst Carlo Besta, Fdn IRCCS, UO Cerebrovasc Dis Cellular Neurobiol Lab, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Cenci, Tonia; Larocca, Luigi Maria] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Inst Pathol, I-00168 Rome, Italy; [Stassi, Giorgio] Carattere Sci Fdn Salvatore Maugeri, Ist Ricovero & Cura, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [De Maria, Ruggero] Mediterranean Inst Oncol, I-95029 Catania, Italy",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09557,Article,,pallini@rm.unicatt.it; demaria@iss.it,U121,Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro,We thank L.

138,273,49.0,"Variation among individuals arises in part from differences in DNA sequences, but the genetic basis for variation in most traits, including common diseases, remains only partly understood. Many DNA variants influence phenotypes by altering the expression level of one or several genes. The effects of such variants can be detected as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL)(1). Traditional eQTL mapping requires large-scale genotype and gene expression data for each individual in the study sample, which limits sample sizes to hundreds of individuals in both humans and model organisms and reduces statistical power(2-6). Consequently, many eQTL are probably missed, especially those with smaller effects(7). Furthermore, most studies use messenger RNA rather than protein abundance as the measure of gene expression. Studies that have used mass-spectrometry proteomics(8-13) reported unexpected differences between eQTL and protein QTL (pQTL) for the same genes(9,10), but these studies have been even more limited in scope. Here we introduce a powerful method for identifying genetic loci that influence protein expression in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We measure single-cell protein abundance through the use of green fluorescent protein tags in very large populations of genetically variable cells, and use pooled sequencing to compare allele frequencies across the genome in thousands of individuals with high versus low protein abundance. We applied this method to 160 genes and detected many more loci per gene than previous studies. We also observed closer correspondence between loci that influence protein abundance and loci that influence mRNA abundance of a given gene. Most loci that we detected were clustered in 'hotspots' that influence multiple proteins, and some hotspots were found to influence more than half of the proteins that we examined. The variants that underlie these hotspots have profound effects on the gene regulatory network and provide insights into genetic variation in cell physiology between yeast strains.","Albert, Frank W.; Treusch, Sebastian; Shockley, Arthur H.; Bloom, Joshua S.; Kruglyak, Leonid","Albert, FW; Treusch, S; Shockley, AH; Bloom, JS; Kruglyak, L",494.0,"[Albert, Frank W.; Bloom, Joshua S.; Kruglyak, Leonid] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Human Genet, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Albert, Frank W.; Treusch, Sebastian] Princeton Univ, Lewis Sigler Inst Integrat Genom, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Shockley, Arthur H.] Synthet Genom, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Bloom, Joshua S.; Kruglyak, Leonid] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Kruglyak, Leonid] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Biol Chem, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12904,Article,1476-4687,falbert@mednet.ucla.edu; LKruglyak@mednet.ucla.edu,+,National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R01 GM102308]; James S.

139,139,432.0,"Small organic molecules recently emerged as a third class of broadly useful asymmetric catalysts that direct reactions to yield predominantly one chiral product, complementing enzymes and metal complexes(1). For instance, the amino acid proline and its derivatives are useful for the catalytic activation of carbonyl compounds via nucleophilic enamine intermediates. Several important carbon carbon bond- forming reactions, including the Mannich reaction, have been developed using this approach(2), all of which are useful for making chiral, biologically relevant compounds. Remarkably, despite attempts(3,4), the simplest of all nucleophiles, acetaldehyde, could not be used in this way. Here we show that acetaldehyde is a powerful nucleophile in asymmetric, proline- catalysed Mannich reactions with N- tert- butoxycarbonyl ( N- Boc)- imines, yielding beta- amino aldehydes with extremely high enantioselectivities- desirable products as drug intermediates and in the synthesis of other biologically active molecules. Although acetaldehyde has been used as a nucleophile in reactions with biological catalysts such as aldolases(5) and thiamine- dependent enzymes(6), and has also been employed indirectly(7-9), its use as an inexpensive and versatile two- carbon nucleophile in asymmetric, small- molecule catalysis will find many practical applications.","Yang, Jung Woon; Chandler, Carley; Stadler, Michael; Kampen, Daniela; List, Benjamin","Yang, JW; Chandler, C; Stadler, M; Kampen, D; List, B",453.0,"[Yang, Jung Woon; Chandler, Carley; Stadler, Michael; Kampen, Daniela; List, Benjamin] Max Planck Inst Kohlenforsch, D-45470 Mulheim, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06740,Article,,list@mpi-muelheim.mpg.de,455,,,279FU,,,"BETA-AMINO ACIDS; ENANTIOSELECTIVE SYNTHESIS; ASYMMETRIC-SYNTHESIS; ALDOL REACTIONS; ALDEHYDES; UK-427,857; INHIBITOR; MARAVIROC; IMINES; POTENT",7186.0,NATURE,Nature,English,24.0,No,"Yang, Jung Woon/0000-0001-8636-0901; ","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",27-Mar,3.0,LONDON,18288105.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,"Yang, Jung Woon/A-5072-2013; List, Benjamin/A-2121-2014","List, B (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Kohlenforsch, Kaiser Wilhelm Pl 1, D-45470 Mulheim, Germany.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,195.0,Proline-catalysed Mannich reactions of acetaldehyde,7.0,94.0,WOS:000254341300027,432.0,452,Multidisciplinary Sciences,196,benjamin,list,50435.0,1475,male,1.0,7OSgjtMAAAAJ,5,"(17929, ]",619749,1,619749,1,André 3000,André 3000,0,0
140,387,195.0,"Free fatty acids provide an important energy source as nutrients, and act as signalling molecules in various cellular processes(1-4). Several G-protein-coupled receptors have been identified as free-fatty-acid receptors important in physiology as well as in several diseases(3,5-13). GPR120 (also known as O3FAR1) functions as a receptor for unsaturated long-chain free fatty acids and has a critical role in various physiological homeostasis mechanisms such as adipogenesis, regulation of appetite and food preference(5,6,14-16). Here we show that GPR120-deficient mice fed a high-fat diet develop obesity, glucose intolerance and fatty liver with decreased adipocyte differentiation and lipogenesis and enhanced hepatic lipogenesis. Insulin resistance in such mice is associated with reduced insulin signalling and enhanced inflammation in adipose tissue. In human, we show that GPR120 expression in adipose tissue is significantly higher in obese individuals than in lean controls. GPR120 exon sequencing in obese subjects reveals a deleterious non-synonymous mutation (p.R270H) that inhibits GPR120 signalling activity. Furthermore, the p.R270H variant increases the risk of obesity in European populations. Overall, this study demonstrates that the lipid sensor GPR120 has a key role in sensing dietary fat and, therefore, in the control of energy balance in both humans and rodents.","Ichimura, Atsuhiko; Hirasawa, Akira;

141,305,175.0,"Longevity is regulated by a network of closely linked metabolic systems. We used a combination of mouse population genetics and RNA interference in Caenorhabditis elegans to identify mitochondrial ribosomal protein S5 (Mrps5) and other mitochondrial ribosomal proteins as metabolic and longevity regulators. MRP knockdown triggers mitonuclear protein imbalance, reducing mitochondrial respiration and activating the mitochondrial unfolded protein response. Specific antibiotics targeting mitochondrial translation and ethidium bromide (which impairs mitochondrial DNA transcription) pharmacologically mimic mrp knockdown and extend worm lifespan by inducing mitonuclear protein imbalance, a stoichiometric imbalance between nuclear and mitochondrially encoded proteins. This mechanism was also conserved in mammalian cells. In addition, resveratrol and rapamycin, longevity compounds acting on different molecular targets, similarly induced mitonuclear protein imbalance, the mitochondrial unfolded protein response and lifespan extension in C. elegans. Collectively these data demonstrate that MRPs represent an evolutionarily conserved protein family that ties the mitochondrial ribosome and mitonuclear protein imbalance to the mitochondrial unfolded protein response, an overarching longevity pathway across many species.","Houtkooper, Riekelt H.; Mouchiroud, Laurent; Ryu, Dongryeol; Moullan, Norman; Katsyuba, Elena; Knott, Graham; Williams, Robert W.; Auwerx, Johan","Houtkooper, RH; Mouchiroud, L; Ryu, D; Moullan, N; Katsyuba, E; Knott, G; Williams, RW; Auwerx, J",451.0,"[Houtkooper, Riekelt H.; Mouchiroud, Laurent; Ryu, Dongryeol; Moullan, Norman; Katsyuba, Elena; Auwerx, Johan] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lab Integrat & Syst Physiol, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Houtkooper, Riekelt H.] Univ Amsterdam, Acad Med Ctr, Lab Genet Metab Dis, NL-1105 AZ Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Knott, Graham] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, BioEM Facil, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Williams, Robert W.] Univ Tennessee, Ctr Hlth Sci, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, Memphis, TN 38163 USA; [Williams, Robert W.] Ctr Integrat & Translat Genom, Memphis, TN 38163 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12188,Article,1476-4687,admin.auwerx@epfl.ch,+,"NWO-Rubicon; AMC; FRM fellowship; EPFL; ERC [2008-AdG-23138]; Velux Stiftung; SNSF; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [P20-DA 21131, UO1AA13499, U01AA14425]; UT Center for Integrative and Translational Genomics; NIH [R01AG043930]","We thank P.

142,1,33.0,"The cellular basis of depressive disorders is poorly understood(1). Recent studies in monkeys indicate that neurons in the lateral habenula (LHb), a nucleus that mediates communication between forebrain and midbrain structures, can increase their activity when an animal fails to receive an expected positive reward or receives a stimulus that predicts aversive conditions (that is, disappointment or anticipation of a negative outcome)(2-4). LHb neurons project to, and modulate, dopamine-rich regions, such as the ventral tegmental area (VTA)(2,5), that control reward-seeking behaviour(6) and participate in depressive disorders(7). Here we show that in two learned helplessness models of depression, excitatory synapses onto LHb neurons projecting to the VTA are potentiated. Synaptic potentiation correlates with an animal's helplessness behaviour and is due to an enhanced presynaptic release probability. Depleting transmitter release by repeated electrical stimulation of LHb afferents, using a protocol that can be effective for patients who are depressed(8,9), markedly suppresses synaptic drive onto VTA-projecting LHb neurons in brain slices and can significantly reduce learned helplessness behaviour in rats. Our results indicate that increased presynaptic action onto LHb neurons contributes to the rodent learned helplessness model of depression.","Li, Bo; Piriz, Joaquin; Mirrione, Martine; Chung, ChiHye; Proulx, Christophe D.; Schulz, Daniela; Henn, Fritz; Malinow, Roberto","Li, B; Piriz, J; Mirrione, M; Chung, CH; Proulx, CD; Schulz, D; Henn, F; Malinow, R",535.0,"[Li, Bo; Piriz, Joaquin; Chung, ChiHye; Proulx, Christophe D.; Malinow, Roberto] Univ Calif San Diego, Ctr Neural Circuits & Behav, Dept Neurosci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Li, Bo; Piriz, Joaquin; Chung, ChiHye; Proulx, Christophe D.; Malinow, Roberto] Univ Calif San Diego, Ctr Neural Circuits & Behav, Dept Biol Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Li, Bo; Mirrione, Martine; Henn, Fritz] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; [Mirrione, Martine; Schulz, Daniela; Henn, Fritz] Brookhaven Natl Lab, Upton, NY 11973 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09742,Article,,bli@cshl.edu; rmalinow@ucsd.edu,U125,"Dana Foundation; National Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes of Health [1R01MH091903-01]; Shiley-Marcos Endowment","We thank K.

143,296,446.0,"Prion infections cause lethal neurodegeneration. This process requires the cellular prion protein (PrPC; ref. 1), which contains a globular domain hinged to a long amino-proximal flexible tail(2). Here we describe rapid neurotoxicity in mice and cerebellar organotypic cultured slices exposed to ligands targeting the alpha 1 and alpha 3 helices of the PrPC globular domain. Ligands included seven distinct monoclonal antibodies(3), monovalent Fab(1) fragments and recombinant single-chain variable fragment miniantibodies. Similar to prion infections(4-6), the toxicity of globular domain ligands required neuronal PrPC, was exacerbated by PrPC overexpression, was associated with calpain activation and was antagonized by calpain inhibitors. Neurodegeneration was accompanied by a burst of reactive oxygen species, and was suppressed by antioxidants. Furthermore, genetic ablation of the superoxide-producing enzyme NOX2 (also known as CYBB) protected mice from globular domain ligand toxicity. We also found that neurotoxicity was prevented by deletions of the octapeptide repeats within the flexible tail. These deletions did not appreciably compromise globular domain antibody binding, suggesting that the flexible tail is required to transmit toxic signals that originate from the globular domain and trigger oxidative stress and calpain activation. Supporting this view, various octapeptide ligands were not only innocuous to both cerebellar organotypic cultured slices and mice, but also prevented the toxicity of globular domain ligands while not interfering with their binding. We conclude that PrPC consists of two functionally distinct modules, with the globular domain and the flexible tail exerting regulatory and executive functions, respectively. Octapeptide ligands also prolonged the life of mice expressing the toxic PrPC mutant(7), PrP(Lambda 94-134), indicating that the flexible tail mediates toxicity in two distinct PrPC-related conditions. Flexible tail-mediated toxicity may conceivably play a role in further prion pathologies, such as familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans bearing supernumerary octapeptides.","Sonati, Tiziana; Reimann, Regina R.; Falsig, Jeppe; Baral, Pravas Kumar; O'Connor, Tracy; Hornemann, Simone; Yaganoglu, Sine; Li, Bei; Herrmann, Uli S.; Wieland, Barbara; Swayampakula, Mridula; Rahman, Muhammad Hafizur; Das, Dipankar; Kav, Nat; Riek, Roland; Liberski, Pawel P.; James, Michael N.

The sophisticated functions of these molecular machines have inspired the development of methods to engineer self-assembling protein nanostructures; however, the design of multi-component protein nanomaterials with high accuracy remains an outstanding challenge. Here we report a computational method for designing protein nanomaterials in which multiple copies of two distinct subunits co-assemble into a specific architecture. We use the method to design five 24-subunit cage-like protein nanomaterials in two distinct symmetric architectures and experimentally demonstrate that their structures are in close agreement with the computational design models. The accuracy of the method and the number and variety of two-component materials that it makes accessible suggest a route to the construction of functional protein nanomaterials tailored to specific applications.","King, Neil P.; Bale, Jacob B.; Sheffler, William; McNamara, Dan E.; Gonen, Shane; Gonen, Tamir; Yeates, Todd O.; Baker, David","King, NP; Bale, JB; Sheffler, W; McNamara, DE; Gonen, S; Gonen, T; Yeates, TO; Baker, D",103.0,"[King, Neil P.; Bale, Jacob B.; Sheffler, William; Gonen, Shane; Baker, David] Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [King, Neil P.; Baker, David] Univ Washington, Inst Prot Design, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Bale, Jacob B.] Univ Washington, Grad Program Mol & Cellular Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [McNamara, Dan E.; Yeates, Todd O.] UCLA Dept Chem & Biochem, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Gonen, Shane; Gonen, Tamir] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA; [Yeates, Todd O.] UCLA DOE Inst Genom & Prote, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Yeates, Todd O.] UCLA Mol Biol Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Baker, David] Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13404,Article,1476-4687,dabaker@u.washington.edu,+,"Howard Hughes Medical Institute; JFRC; National Science Foundation [CHE-1332907]; International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, DTRA [N00024-10-D-6318/0024]; AFOSR [FA950-12-10112]; DOE [DE-SC0005155]; NIH [T32GM067555]; NSF [DGE-0718124]; BER programme of the DOE Office of Science","We thank D.

146,245,177.0,"As modern humans migrated out of Africa, they encountered many new environmental conditions, including greater temperature extremes, different pathogens and higher altitudes. These diverse environments are likely to have acted as agents of natural selection and to have led to local adaptations. One of the most celebrated examples in humans is the adaptation of Tibetans to the hypoxic environment of the high-altitude Tibetan plateau(1-3). A hypoxia pathway gene, EPAS1, was previously identified as having the most extreme signature of positive selection in Tibetans(4-10), and was shown to be associated with differences in haemoglobin concentration at high altitude. Re-sequencing the region around EPAS1 in 40 Tibetan and 40 Han individuals, we find that this gene has a highly unusual haplotype structure that can only be convincingly explained by introgression of DNA from Denisovan or Denisovan-related individuals into humans. Scanning a larger set of worldwide populations, we find that the selected haplotype is only found in Denisovans and in Tibetans, and at very low frequency among Han Chinese. Furthermore, the length of the haplotype, and the fact that it is not found in any other populations, makes it unlikely that the haplotype sharing between Tibetans and Denisovans was caused by incomplete ancestral lineage sorting rather than introgression. Our findings illustrate that admixture with other hominin species has provided genetic variation that helped humans to adapt to new environments.","Huerta-Sanchez, Emilia; Jin, Xin; Asan; Bianba, Zhuoma; Peter, Benjamin M.; Vinckenbosch, Nicolas; Liang, Yu; Yi, Xin; He, Mingze; Somel, Mehmet; Ni, Peixiang; Wang, Bo; Ou, Xiaohua; Huasang; Luosang, Jiangbai; Cuo, Zha Xi Ping; Li, Kui; Gao, Guoyi; Yin, Ye; Wang, Wei; Zhang, Xiuqing; Xu, Xun; Yang, Huanming; Li, Yingrui; Wang, Jian; Wang, Jun; Nielsen, Rasmus","Huerta-Sanchez, E; Jin, X; Asan; Bianba, Z; Peter, BM; Vinckenbosch, N; Liang, Y; Yi, X; He, MZ; Somel, M; Ni, PX; Wang, B; Ou, XH; Huasang; Luosang, JB; Cuo, ZXP; Li, K; Gao, GY; Yin, Y; Wang, W; Zhang, XQ; Xu, X; Yang, HM; Li, YR; Wang, J; Wang, J; Nielsen, R",194.0,"[Huerta-Sanchez, Emilia; Jin, Xin; Asan; Liang, Yu; Yi, Xin; He, Mingze; Somel, Mehmet; Ni, Peixiang; Wang, Bo; Ou, Xiaohua; Huasang; Luosang, Jiangbai; Yin, Ye; Wang, Wei; Zhang, Xiuqing; Xu, Xun; Yang, Huanming; Li, Yingrui; Wang, Jian; Wang, Jun; Nielsen, Rasmus] BGI Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, Peoples R China; [Huerta-Sanchez, Emilia; Peter, Benjamin M.; Vinckenbosch, Nicolas; Nielsen, Rasmus] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Huerta-Sanchez, Emilia] Univ Calif, Sch Nat Sci, Merced, CA 95343 USA; [Jin, Xin] S China Univ Technol, Sch Biosci & Bioengn, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Asan; Liang, Yu; Yi, Xin] BGI Tianjin, Binhai Genom Inst, Tianjin 300308, Peoples R China; [Asan; Liang, Yu; Yi, Xin] BGI Tianjin, Tianjin Translat Genom Ctr, Tianjin 300308, Peoples R China; [Bianba, Zhuoma] Peoples Hosp Lhasa, Lhasa 850000, Peoples R China; [He, Mingze] Iowa State Univ, Bioinformat & Computat Biol Program, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Somel, Mehmet] Middle E Tech Univ, Dept Biol Sci, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey; [Cuo, Zha Xi Ping] Second Peoples Hosp Tibet Autonomous Reg, Lhasa 850000, Peoples R China; [Li, Kui] Peoples Hosp Tibet Autonomous Reg, Lhasa 850000, Peoples R China; [Gao, Guoyi] Hosp XiShuangBanNa Dai Nationalities, Autonomous Jinghong 666100, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiuqing] BGI Shenzhen, Guangdong Enterprise Key Lab Human Dis Genom, Shenzhen 518083, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiuqing] BGI Shenzhen, Shenzhen Key Lab Trans Biotechnol, Shenzhen 518083, Peoples R China; [Yang, Huanming; Wang, Jun] King Abdulaziz Univ, Princess Al Jawhara Ctr Excellence Res Hereditary, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia; [Yang, Huanming; Wang, Jian] James D Watson Inst Genome Sci, Hangzhou 310008, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jun; Nielsen, Rasmus] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Wang, Jun] Macau Univ Sci & Technol, Taipa 999078, Macau, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jun] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Med, Hong Kong 999077, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Nielsen, Rasmus] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Stat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13408,Article,1476-4687,wangjian@genomics.cn; wangj@genomics.cn; rasmus_nielsen@berkeley.edu,+,"973 Program [2011CB809203, 2012CB518201, 2011CB809201, 2011CB809202]; State Key Development Program for Basic Research of China; China National GeneBank-Shenzhen; Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Transomics Biotechnologies [CXB201108250096A]; US NIH [R01HG003229, R01HG003229-08S2]","This research was funded by the State Key Development Program for Basic Research of China, 973 Program (2011CB809203, 2012CB518201, 2011CB809201, 2011CB809202), China National GeneBank-Shenzhen and Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Transomics Biotechnologies (no.

Microstimulation(8,9) and trans-synaptic tracing(10,11) identified two non-overlapping candidate tongue motor cortical areas. Inactivating either area impaired voluntary licking. Imaging in layer 2/3 showed neurons with diverse response types in both areas. Activity in approximately half of the imaged neurons distinguished trial types associated with different actions. Many neurons showed modulation coinciding with or preceding the action, consistent with their involvement in motor control. Neurons with different response types were spatially intermingled. Nearby neurons (within similar to 150 mm) showed pronounced coincident activity. These temporal correlations increased with learning within and across behavioural sessions, specifically for neuron pairs with similar response types. We propose that correlated activity in specific ensembles of functionally related neurons is a signature of learning-related circuit plasticity. Our findings reveal a fine-scale and dynamic organization of the frontal cortex that probably underlies flexible behaviour.","Komiyama, Takaki; Sato, Takashi R.; O'Connor, Daniel H.; Zhang, Ying-Xin; Huber, Daniel; Hooks, Bryan M.; Gabitto, Mariano; Svoboda, Karel","Komiyama, T; Sato, TR; O'Connor, DH; Zhang, YX; Huber, D; Hooks, BM; Gabitto, M; Svoboda, K",1182.0,"[Komiyama, Takaki; Sato, Takashi R.; O'Connor, Daniel H.; Zhang, Ying-Xin; Huber, Daniel; Hooks, Bryan M.; Svoboda, Karel] HHMI, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA; [Gabitto, Mariano] Univ Calif San Diego, HHMI, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Gabitto, Mariano] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Neurobiol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Gabitto, Mariano] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Neurosci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08897,Article,,komiyamat@janelia.hhmi.org,U99,Howard Hughes Medical Institute,"We thank D.

148,379,43.0,"Copy number variants (CNVs) are major contributors to genetic disorders(1). We have dissected a region of the 16p11.2 chromosome-which encompasses 29 genes-that confers susceptibility to neurocognitive defects when deleted or duplicated(2,3). Overexpression of each human transcript in zebrafish embryos identified KCTD13 as the sole message capable of inducing the microcephaly phenotype associated with the 16p11.2 duplication(2-5), whereas suppression of the same locus yielded the macrocephalic phenotype associated with the 16p11.2 deletion(5,6), capturing the mirror phenotypes of humans. Analyses of zebrafish and mouse embryos suggest that microcephaly is caused by decreased proliferation of neuronal progenitors with concomitant increase in apoptosis in the developing brain, whereas macrocephaly arises by increased proliferation and no changes in apoptosis. A role for KCTD13 dosage changes is consistent with autism in both a recently reported family with a reduced 16p11.2 deletion and a subject reported here with a complex 16p11.2 rearrangement involving de novo structural alteration of KCTD13. Our data suggest that KCTD13 is a major driver for the neurodevelopmental phenotypes associated with the 16p11.2 CNV, reinforce the idea that one or a small number of transcripts within a CNV can underpin clinical phenotypes, and offer an efficient route to identifying dosage-sensitive loci.","Golzio, Christelle; Willer, Jason; Talkowski, Michael E.; Oh, Edwin C.; Taniguchi, Yu; Jacquemont, Sebastien; Reymond, Alexandre; Sun, Mei; Sawa, Akira; Gusella, James F.; Kamiya, Atsushi; Beckmann, Jacques S.; Katsanis, Nicholas","Golzio, C; Willer, J; Talkowski, ME; Oh, EC; Taniguchi, Y; Jacquemont, S; Reymond, A; Sun, M; Sawa, A; Gusella, JF; Kamiya, A; Beckmann, JS; Katsanis, N",363.0,"[Golzio, Christelle; Willer, Jason; Oh, Edwin C.; Katsanis, Nicholas] Duke Univ, Ctr Human Dis Modeling, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Golzio, Christelle; Willer, Jason; Oh, Edwin C.; Katsanis, Nicholas] Duke Univ, Dept Cell Biol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Talkowski, Michael E.; Sun, Mei; Gusella, James F.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Human Genet Res, Mol Neurogenet Unit, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Talkowski, Michael E.; Gusella, James F.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurol & Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Taniguchi, Yu; Sawa, Akira; Kamiya, Atsushi] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA; [Jacquemont, Sebastien; Beckmann, Jacques S.] CHU Vaudois, Serv Med Genet, CH-1011 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Reymond, Alexandre] Univ Lausanne, Ctr Integrat Gen, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Beckmann, Jacques S.] Univ Lausanne, Dept Med Genet, CH-1005 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Katsanis, Nicholas] Duke Univ, Dept Pediat, Durham, NC 27710 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11091,Article,,katsanis@cellbio.duke.edu,U111,"Silvo O.

149,134,344.0,"River networks, seen as ecological corridors featuring connected and hierarchical dendritic landscapes for animals and plants, present unique challenges and opportunities for testing biogeographical theories and macroecological laws(1). Although local and basin- scale differences in riverine fish diversity have been analysed as functions of energy availability and habitat heterogeneity(2), scale- dependent environmental conditions(3) and river discharge(4,5), a model that predicts a comprehensive set of system-wide diversity patterns has been hard to find. Here we show that fish diversity patterns throughout the Mississippi - Missouri River System are well described by a neutral metacommunity model coupled with an appropriate habitat capacity distribution and dispersal kernel. River network structure acts as an effective template for characterizing spatial attributes of fish biodiversity. We show that estimates of average dispersal behaviour and habitat capacities, objectively calculated from average runoff production, yield reliable predictions of large- scale spatial biodiversity patterns in riverine systems. The success of the neutral theory in two- dimensional forest ecosystems(6-8) and here in dendritic riverine ecosystems suggests the possible application of neutral metacommunity models in a diverse suite of ecosystems. This framework offers direct linkage from large- scale forcing, such as global climate change, to biodiversity patterns.","Muneepeerakul, Rachata; Bertuzzo, Enrico; Lynch, Heather J.; Fagan, William F.; Rinaldo, Andrea; Rodriguez-Iturbe, Ignacio","Muneepeerakul, R; Bertuzzo, E; Lynch, HJ; Fagan, WF; Rinaldo, A; Rodriguez-Iturbe, I",220.0,"[Muneepeerakul, Rachata; Bertuzzo, Enrico; Rodriguez-Iturbe, Ignacio] Princeton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Bertuzzo, Enrico; Rinaldo, Andrea] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Fac ENAC, Lab Ecohydrol, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Lynch, Heather J.; Fagan, William F.] Univ Maryland, Dept Biol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Rinaldo, Andrea] Univ Padua, Dipartimento Ingn Idraul Marittima Ambientale & G, I-35131 Padua, Italy; [Rinaldo, Andrea] Univ Padua, Ctr Int Idrol Dino Tonini, I-35131 Padua, Italy",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06813,Article,1476-4687,rmuneepe@princeton.edu; irodrigu@princeton.edu,U9,,,297BP,,,RELATIVE SPECIES ABUNDANCE; RIVER NETWORKS; BIODIVERSITY; ECOLOGY; COMMUNITIES,7192.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,"Bertuzzo, Enrico/0000-0001-5872-0666","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",8-May,4.0,LONDON,18464742.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,"Lynch, Heather/E-7371-2012","Muneepeerakul, R (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, E Quad, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,165.0,Neutral metacommunity models predict fish diversity patterns in Mississippi-Missouri basin,4.0,114.0,WOS:000255592400039,344.0,453,Multidisciplinary Sciences,168,ignacio,rodriguez-iturbe,28547.0,451,male,1.0,GSyUS9wAAAAJ,5,"(17929, ]",16067675,1,1858623,1,Ignacio Rodriguez-Iturbe,Ignacio Rodriguez-Iturbe,1,1
150,81,22.0,"Brachydactyly type A1 (BDA1) was the first recorded disorder of the autosomal dominant Mendelian trait in humans, characterized by shortened or absent middle phalanges in digits. It is associated with heterozygous missense mutations in indian hedgehog (IHH)(1,2). Hedgehog proteins are important morphogens for a wide range of developmental processes(3,4). The capacity and range of signalling is thought to be regulated by its interaction with the receptor PTCH1 and antagonist HIP1. Here we show that a BDA1 mutation (E95K) in Ihh impairs the interaction of IHH with PTCH1 and HIP1. This is consistent with a recent paper showing that BDA1 mutations cluster in a calcium-binding site essential for the interaction with its receptor and cell-surface partners(5). Furthermore, we show that in a mouse model that recapitulates the E95K mutation, there is a change in the potency and range of signalling. The mice have digit abnormalities consistent with the human disorder.","Gao, Bo; Hu, Jianxin; Stricker, Sigmar; Cheung, Martin; Ma, Gang; Law, Kit Fong; Witte, Florian; Briscoe, James; Mundlos, Stefan; He, Lin; Cheah, Kathryn S.

151,284,221.0,"Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are polymodal signal detectors that respond to a wide range of physical and chemical stimuli. Elucidating how these channels integrate and convert physiological signals into channel opening is essential to understanding how they regulate cell excitability under normal and pathophysiological conditions. Here we exploit pharmacological probes (a peptide toxin and small vanilloid agonists) to determine structures of two activated states of the capsaicin receptor, TRPV1. A domain (consisting of transmembrane segments 1-4) that moves during activation of voltage-gated channels remains stationary in TRPV1, highlighting differences in gating mechanisms for these structurally related channel superfamilies. TRPV1 opening is associated with major structural rearrangements in the outer pore, including the pore helix and selectivity filter, as well as pronounced dilation of a hydrophobic constriction at the lower gate, suggesting a dual gating mechanism. Allosteric coupling between upper and lower gates may account for rich physiological modulation exhibited by TRPV1 and other TRP channels.","Cao, Erhu; Liao, Maofu; Cheng, Yifan; Julius, David","Cao, EH; Liao, MF; Cheng, YF; Julius, D",113.0,"[Cao, Erhu; Julius, David] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Physiol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Liao, Maofu; Cheng, Yifan] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Keck Adv Microscopy Lab, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12823,Article,1476-4687,ycheng@ucsf.edu; david.julius@ucsf.edu,+,"National Institutes of Health [R01GM098672, S10RR026814, R01NS065071, R01NS047723]; National Science Foundation [DBI-0960271]; University of California, San Francisco Program for Breakthrough Biomedical Research","We thank X.

Obtained from similar to 4,000-year-old permafrost-preserved hair, the genome represents a male individual from the first known culture to settle in Greenland. Sequenced to an average depth of 20X, we recover 79% of the diploid genome, an amount close to the practical limit of current sequencing technologies. We identify 353,151 high-confidence single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), of which 6.8% have not been reported previously. We estimate raw read contamination to be no higher than 0.8%. We use functional SNP assessment to assign possible phenotypic characteristics of the individual that belonged to a culture whose location has yielded only trace human remains. We compare the high-confidence SNPs to those of contemporary populations to find the populations most closely related to the individual. This provides evidence for a migration from Siberia into the New World some 5,500 years ago, independent of that giving rise to the modern Native Americans and Inuit.","Rasmussen, Morten; Li, Yingrui; Lindgreen, Stinus; Pedersen, Jakob Skou; Albrechtsen, Anders; Moltke, Ida; Metspalu, Mait; Metspalu, Ene; Kivisild, Toomas; Gupta, Ramneek; Bertalan, Marcelo; Nielsen, Kasper; Gilbert, M.
