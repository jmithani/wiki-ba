0,121,153.0,"Understanding the dynamics of correlated many-body quantum systems is a challenge for modern physics. Owing to the simplicity of theirHamiltonians, He-4 (bosons) and He-3 (fermions) have served as model systems for strongly interacting quantum fluids, with substantial efforts devoted to their understanding. An important milestone was the direct observation of the collective phonon-roton mode in liquid He-4 by neutron scattering, verifying Landau's prediction(1) and his fruitful concept of elementary excitations. In a Fermi system, collective density fluctuations (known as 'zero-sound' in He-3, and 'plasmons' in charged systems) and incoherent particle-hole excitations are observed. At small wavevectors and energies, both types of excitation are described by Landau's theory of Fermi liquids(2,3). At higher wavevectors, the collectivemode enters the particle-hole band, where it is strongly damped. The dynamics of Fermi liquids at high wavevectors was thus believed to be essentially incoherent. Here we report inelastic neutron scattering measurements of a monolayer of liquid He-3, observing a roton-like excitation. We find that the collective density mode reappears as a well defined excitation atmomentum transfers larger than twice the Fermi momentum. We thus observe unexpected collective behaviour of a Fermi many-body system in the regime beyond the scope of Landau's theory. A satisfactory interpretation of the measured spectra is obtained using a dynamic many-body theory(4).","Godfrin, Henri; Meschke, Matthias; Lauter, Hans-Jochen; Sultan, Ahmad; Boehm, Helga M.; Krotscheck, Eckhard; Panholzer, Martin","Godfrin, H; Meschke, M; Lauter, HJ; Sultan, A; Bohm, HM; Krotscheck, E; Panholzer, M",576.0,"[Godfrin, Henri; Meschke, Matthias; Sultan, Ahmad] CNRS, Inst Neel, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France; [Godfrin, Henri; Meschke, Matthias; Sultan, Ahmad] Univ Grenoble 1, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France; [Meschke, Matthias] Aalto Univ, Low Temp Lab, Aalto 00076, Finland; [Lauter, Hans-Jochen] Inst Laue Langevin, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France; [Lauter, Hans-Jochen] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Boehm, Helga M.; Krotscheck, Eckhard; Panholzer, Martin] Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Inst Theoret Phys, A-4040 Linz, Austria; [Krotscheck, Eckhard] SUNY Buffalo, Dept Phys, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10919,Article,,henri.godfrin@grenoble.cnrs.fr,579,Austrian Fonds zur Forderung der wissenschaftlichen Forschung (FWF) [P21264]; French Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-2010-INTB-403-01]; EU [228464],"We are grateful to the Austrian-French programme Amadeus for providing initial support; to the Austrian Fonds zur Forderung der wissenschaftlichen Forschung (FWF grant P21264), the French Agence Nationale de la Recherche (project ANR-2010-INTB-403-01) and the EU FRP7 low-temperature infrastructure grant Microkelvin (project number 228464) for funding this research; and to the Institut Laue-Langevin for use of the facility.",915EF,,,ELEMENTARY EXCITATIONS; EFFECTIVE-MASS; NEUTRON-SCATTERING; SPIN FLUCTUATIONS; ZERO SOUND; HE-3; FILMS; PLASMONS; GRAPHITE; DYNAMICS,7391.0,NATURE,Nature,English,31.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",29-Mar,4.0,LONDON,22460903.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2012.0,"Meschke, Matthias/G-5166-2012","Godfrin, H (reprint author), CNRS, Inst Neel, BP 166, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,17.0,Observation of a roton collective mode in a two-dimensional Fermi liquid,5.0,40.0,WOS:000302006100034,153.0,483,Multidisciplinary Sciences,17,martin,panholzer,118.0,3568,male,1.0,oDRnEUgAAAAJ,1,"[0, 1474]",143848,1,143848,1,List of suicides,List of suicides,0,0
1,106,60.0,"Branching river networks are one of the most widespread and recognizable features of Earth's landscapes and have also been discovered elsewhere in the Solar System(1,2). But the mechanisms that create these patterns and control their spatial scales are poorly understood. Theories based on probability(3-5) or optimality(3,6-8) have proven useful(9), but do not explain how river networks develop over time through erosion and sediment transport. Here we show that branching at the uppermost reaches of river networks is rooted in two coupled instabilities: first, valleys widen at the expense of their smaller neighbours, and second, side slopes of the widening valleys become susceptible to channel incision. Each instability occurs at a critical ratio of the characteristic timescales for soil transport and channel incision. Measurements from two field sites demonstrate that our theory correctly predicts the size of the smallest valleys with tributaries. We also show that the dominant control on the scale of landscape dissection in these sites is the strength of channel incision, which correlates with aridity and rock weakness, rather than the strength of soil transport. These results imply that the fine-scale structure of branching river networks is an organized signature of erosional mechanics, not a consequence of random topology.","Perron, J.

2,64,333.0,"Flat-slab subduction occurs when the descending plate becomes horizontal at some depth before resuming its descent into the mantle. It is often proposed as a mechanism for the uplifting of deep crustal rocks ('thick-skinned' deformation) far from plate boundaries, and for causing unusual patterns of volcanism, as far back as the Proterozoic eon(1). For example, the formation of the expansive Rocky Mountains and the subsequent voluminous volcanism across much of the western USA has been attributed to a broad region of flat-slab subduction beneath North America that occurred during the Laramide orogeny (80-55 million years ago)(2). Here we study the largest modern flat slab, located in Peru, to better understand the processes controlling the formation and extent of flat slabs. We present new data that indicate that the subducting Nazca Ridge is necessary for the development and continued support of the horizontal plate at a depth of about 90 kilometres. By combining constraints from Rayleigh wave phase velocities with improved earthquake locations, we find that the flat slab is shallowest along the ridge, while to the northwest of the ridge, the slab is sagging, tearing, and re-initiating normal subduction. On the basis of our observations, we propose a conceptual model for the temporal evolution of the Peruvian flat slab in which the flat slab forms because of the combined effects of trench retreat along the Peruvian plate boundary, suction, and ridge subduction. We find that while the ridge is necessary but not sufficient for the formation of the flat slab, its removal is sufficient for the flat slab to fail. This provides new constraints on our understanding of the processes controlling the beginning and end of the Laramide orogeny and other putative episodes of flat-slab subduction.","Antonijevic, Sanja Knezevic; Wagner, Lara S.; Kumar, Abhash; Beck, Susan L.; Long, Maureen D.; Zandt, George; Tavera, Hernando; Condori, Cristobal","Antonijevic, SK; Wagner, LS; Kumar, A; Beck, SL; Long, MD; Zandt, G; Tavera, H; Condori, C",212.0,"[Antonijevic, Sanja Knezevic; Kumar, Abhash] Univ N Carolina, Dept Geol Sci, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Wagner, Lara S.] Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Terr Magnetism, Washington, DC 20015 USA; [Beck, Susan L.; Zandt, George] Univ Arizona, Dept Geosci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Long, Maureen D.] Yale Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Tavera, Hernando; Condori, Cristobal] Inst Geofis Peru, Lima 15012, Peru",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14648,Article,1476-4687,sknezevi@live.unc.edu,+,"NSF [EAR-0944184, EAR-0943991, EAR-0943962, EAR-0908777, EAR-0907880]","We thank R.

3,51,370.0,"The genetic divergence time between two species varies substantially across the genome, conveying important information about the timing and process of speciation. Here we develop a framework for studying this variation and apply it to about 20 million base pairs of aligned sequence from humans, chimpanzees, gorillas and more distantly related primates. Human-chimpanzee genetic divergence varies from less than 84% to more than 147% of the average, a range of more than 4 million years. Our analysis also shows that human-chimpanzee speciation occurred less than 6.3 million years ago and probably more recently, conflicting with some interpretations of ancient fossils. Most strikingly, chromosome X shows an extremely young genetic divergence time, close to the genome minimum along nearly its entire length. These unexpected features would be explained if the human and chimpanzee lineages initially diverged, then later exchanged genes before separating permanently.","Patterson, Nick; Richter, Daniel J.; Gnerre, Sante; Lander, Eric S.; Reich, David","Patterson, N; Richter, DJ; Gnerre, S; Lander, ES; Reich, D",1103.0,"Harvard Univ, Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; MIT, Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature04789,Article,1476-4687,reich@genetics.med.harvard.edu,1108,,,057SM,,,ANCESTRAL POPULATION SIZES; DNA-SEQUENCES; DIVERGENCE TIMES; UPPER MIOCENE; DROSOPHILA-MAURITIANA; MAMMALIAN EVOLUTION; GENOME SEQUENCE; HOMINID; CHAD; PALEONTOLOGY,7097.0,NATURE,Nature,English,43.0,No,"Richter, Daniel/0000-0002-9238-5571","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",28-Jun,6.0,LONDON,16710306.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,,"Reich, D (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,319.0,Genetic evidence for complex speciation of humans and chimpanzees,4.0,100.0,WOS:000238615500040,370.0,441,Multidisciplinary Sciences,326,david,reich,14.0,12593,male,1.0,rK-2mFQAAAAJ,1,"[0, 1474]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
4,16,366.0,"A powerful way to discover key genes with causal roles in oncogenesis is to identify genomic regions that undergo frequent alteration in human cancers. Here we present high-resolution analyses of somatic copy-number alterations (SCNAs) from 3,131 cancer specimens, belonging largely to 26 histological types. We identify 158 regions of focal SCNA that are altered at significant frequency across several cancer types, of which 122 cannot be explained by the presence of a known cancer target gene located within these regions. Several gene families are enriched among these regions of focal SCNA, including the BCL2 family of apoptosis regulators and the NF-kappa B pathway. We show that cancer cells containing amplifications surrounding the MCL1 and BCL2L1 anti-apoptotic genes depend on the expression of these genes for survival. Finally, we demonstrate that a large majority of SCNAs identified in individual cancer types are present in several cancer types.","Beroukhim, Rameen; Mermel, Craig H.; Porter, Dale; Wei, Guo; Raychaudhuri, Soumya;

5,83,335.0,"PINK1 (PTEN induced putative kinase 1) and PARKIN (also known as PARK2) have been identified as the causal genes responsible for hereditary recessive early-onset Parkinsonism(1,2). PINK1 is a Ser/Thr kinase that specifically accumulates on depolarized mitochondria, whereas parkin is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that catalyses ubiquitin transfer to mitochondrial substrates(3-5). PINK1 acts as an upstream factor for parkin(6,7) and is essential both for the activation of latent E3 parkin activity(8) and for recruiting parkin onto depolarized mitochondria(8-12). Recently, mechanistic insights into mitochondrial quality control mediated by PINK1 and parkin have been revealed(3-5), and PINK1-dependent phosphorylation of parkin has been reported(13-15). However, the requirement of PINK1 for parkin activation was not bypassed by phosphomimetic parkin mutation(15), and how PINK1 accelerates the E3 activity of parkin on damaged mitochondria is still obscure. Here we report that ubiquitin is the genuine substrate of PINK1. PINK1 phosphorylated ubiquitin at Ser 65 both in vitro and in cells, and a Ser 65 phosphopeptide derived from endogenous ubiquitin was only detected in cells in the presence of PINK1 and following a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential. Unexpectedly, phosphomimetic ubiquitin bypassed PINK1-dependent activation of a phosphomimetic parkin mutant in cells. Furthermore, phosphomimetic ubiquitin accelerates discharge of the thioester conjugate formed by UBCH7 (also known as UBE2L3) and ubiquitin (UBCH7 ubiquitin) in the presence of parkin in vitro, indicating that it acts allosterically. The phosphorylation-dependent interaction between ubiquitin and parkin suggests that phosphorylated ubiquitin unlocks autoinhibition of the catalytic cysteine. Our results show that PINK1-dependent phosphorylation of both parkin and ubiquitin is sufficient for full activation of parkin E3 activity. These findings demonstrate that phosphorylated ubiquitin is a parkin activator.","Koyano, Fumika; Okatsu, Kei; Kosako, Hidetaka; Tamura, Yasushi; Go, Etsu; Kimura, Mayumi; Kimura, Yoko; Tsuchiya, Hikaru; Yoshihara, Hidehito; Hirokawa, Takatsugu; Endo, Toshiya; Fon, Edward A.; Trempe, Jean-Francois; Saeki, Yasushi; Tanaka, Keiji; Matsuda, Noriyuki","Koyano, F; Okatsu, K; Kosako, H; Tamura, Y; Go, E; Kimura, M; Kimura, Y; Tsuchiya, H; Yoshihara, H; Hirokawa, T; Endo, T; Fon, EA; Trempe, JF; Saeki, Y; Tanaka, K; Matsuda, N",162.0,"[Koyano, Fumika; Okatsu, Kei; Go, Etsu; Kimura, Mayumi; Kimura, Yoko; Tsuchiya, Hikaru; Yoshihara, Hidehito; Saeki, Yasushi; Tanaka, Keiji; Matsuda, Noriyuki] Tokyo Metropolitan Inst Med Sci, Lab Prot Metab, Setagaya Ku, Tokyo 1568506, Japan; [Koyano, Fumika; Okatsu, Kei] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778561, Japan; [Kosako, Hidetaka] Univ Tokushima, Div Cell Signaling, Fujii Mem Inst Med Sci, Tokushima 7708503, Japan; [Tamura, Yasushi] Nagoya Univ, Res Ctr Mat Sci, Nagoya, Aichi 4648602, Japan; [Kimura, Yoko] Shizuoka Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Shizuoka 4228529, Japan; [Hirokawa, Takatsugu] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Mol Profiling Res Ctr Drug Discovery, Koto Ku, Tokyo 1350064, Japan; [Endo, Toshiya] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Sci, JST CREST Dept Chem, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648602, Japan; [Endo, Toshiya] Kyoto Sangyo Univ, JST CREST Fac Life Sci, Kita Ku, Kyoto 6038555, Japan; [Fon, Edward A.] McGill Univ, McGill Parkinson Program, Dept Neurol & Neurosurg, Montreal Neurol Inst & Hosp, Montreal, PQ H3A 2B4, Canada; [Trempe, Jean-Francois] McGill Univ, Dept Pharmacol & Therapeut, Montreal, PQ H3G 1Y6, Canada; [Matsuda, Noriyuki] Tokyo Metropolitan Inst Med Sci, Prot Metab Project, Setagaya Ku, Tokyo 1568506, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13392,Article,1476-4687,tanaka-kj@igakuken.or.jp; matsuda-nr@igakuken.or.jp,+,"JSPS KAKENHI [23687018, 23-6061, 21000012, 24657072, 22227003]; MEXT KAKENHI [24111557, 25112522, 24112008]; Tomizawa Jun-ichi and Keiko Fund; JST CREST; Platform for Drug Discovery, Informatics, and Structural Life Science from MEXT; McGill University; GRASP from the FRSQ; CIHR; FRSQ; Takeda Science Foundation","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI grant numbers 23687018 (to N.M.), 23-6061 (to K.O.), 21000012 (to K.

6,15,329.0,"Although bisexual reproduction has proven to be highly successful, parthenogenetic all-female populations occur frequently in certain taxa, including the whiptail lizards of the genus Aspidoscelis. Allozyme analysis revealed a high degree of fixed heterozygosity in these parthenogenetic species(1,2), supporting the view that they originated from hybridization events between related sexual species. It has remained unclear how the meiotic program is altered to produce diploid eggs while maintaining heterozygosity. Here we show that meiosis commences with twice the number of chromosomes in parthenogenetic versus sexual species, a mechanism that provides the basis for generating gametes with unreduced chromosome content without fundamental deviation from the classic meiotic program. Our observation of synaptonemal complexes and chiasmata demonstrate that a typical meiotic program occurs and that heterozygosity is not maintained by bypassing recombination. Instead, fluorescent in situ hybridization probes that distinguish between homologues reveal that bivalents form between sister chromosomes, the genetically identical products of the first of two premeiotic replication cycles. Sister chromosome pairing provides a mechanism for the maintenance of heterozygosity, which is critical for offsetting the reduced fitness associated with the lack of genetic diversity in parthenogenetic species.","Lutes, Aracely A.; Neaves, William B.; Baumann, Diana P.; Wiegraebe, Winfried; Baumann, Peter","Lutes, AA; Neaves, WB; Baumann, DP; Wiegraebe, W; Baumann, P",283.0,"[Lutes, Aracely A.; Neaves, William B.; Baumann, Diana P.; Wiegraebe, Winfried; Baumann, Peter] Stowers Inst Med Res, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; [Lutes, Aracely A.; Baumann, Peter] Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Dept Mol & Integrat Physiol, Kansas City, KS 66160 USA; [Neaves, William B.] Univ Missouri, Sch Med, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; [Baumann, Peter] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08818,Article,,peb@stowers.org,U164,Stowers Institute for Medical Research; Pew Charitable Trusts,"We thank the staff of the Reptile Facility for their dedication to animal husbandry; C.

7,28,366.0,"Dome growth and explosive degassing are fundamental processes in the cycle of continental arc volcanism(1,2). Because both processes generate seismic energy, geophysical field studies of volcanic processes are often grounded in the interpretation of volcanic earthquakes(3). Although previous seismic studies have provided important constraints on volcano dynamics(4-6), such inversion results do not uniquely constrain magma source dimension and material properties. Here we report combined optical geodetic and seismic observations that robustly constrain the sources of long-period volcanic earthquakes coincident with frequent explosive eruptions at the volcano Santiaguito, in Guatemala. The acceleration of dome deformation, extracted from high- resolution optical image processing, is shown to be associated with recorded long-period seismic sources and the frequency content of seismic signals measured across a broadband network. These earthquake sources are observed as abrupt subvertical surface displacements of the dome, in which 20 - 50- cm uplift originates at the central vent and propagates at similar to 50 m s(-1) towards the 200- m- diameter periphery. Episodic shifts of the 20 - 80- m thick dome induce peak forces greater than 10(9) N and reflect surface manifestations of the volcanic long- period earthquakes, a broad class of volcano seismic activity that is poorly understood and observed at many volcanic centres worldwide(7). On the basis of these observations, the abrupt mass shift of solidified domes, conduit magma or magma pads may play a part in generating long- period earthquakes at silicic volcanic systems.","Johnson, Jeffrey B.; Lees, Jonathan M.; Gerst, Alexander; Sahagian, Dork; Varley, Nick","Johnson, JB; Lees, JM; Gerst, A; Sahagian, D; Varley, N",377.0,"[Johnson, Jeffrey B.] New Mexico Inst Min & Technol, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Socorro, NM 87801 USA; [Lees, Jonathan M.] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Gerst, Alexander] Univ Hamburg, Inst Geophys, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Sahagian, Dork] Lehigh Univ, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA; [Varley, Nick] Univ Colima, Fac Ciencias, Colima 28045, Mexico",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07429,Article,,jeff.johnson@ees.nmt.edu,381,"US National Science Foundation EAR [0440225, 0440054]","We thank the many personnel involved with instrumentation preparation and field work, including R.

8,62,315.0,"Nearly three-quarters of the growth in global carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels and cement production between 2010 and 2012 occurred in China(1,2). Yet estimates of Chinese emissions remain subject to large uncertainty; inventories of China's total fossil fuel carbon emissions in 2008 differ by 0.3 gigatonnes of carbon, or 15 per cent(1,3-5). The primary sources of this uncertainty are conflicting estimates of energy consumption and emission factors, the latter being uncertain because of very few actual measurements representative of the mix of Chinese fuels. Here we re-evaluate China's carbon emissions using updated and harmonized energy consumption and clinker production data and two new and comprehensive sets of measured emission factors for Chinese coal. We find that total energy consumption in China was 10 per cent higher in 2000-2012 than the value reported by China's national statistics(6), that emission factors for Chinese coal are on average 40 per cent lower than the default values recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(7), and that emissions from China's cement production are 45 per cent less than recent estimates(1,4). Altogether, our revised estimate of China's CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement production is 2.49 gigatonnes of carbon (2 standard deviations = +/-7.3 per cent) in 2013, which is 14 per cent lower than the emissions reported by other prominent inventories(1,4,8). Over the full period 2000 to 2013, our revised estimates are 2.9 gigatonnes of carbon less than previous estimates of China's cumulative carbon emissions(1,4). Our findings suggest that overestimation of China's emissions in 2000-2013 may be larger than China's estimated total forest sink in 1990-2007 (2.66 gigatonnes of carbon)(9) or China's land carbon sink in 2000-2009 (2.6 gigatonnes of carbon)(10).","Liu, Zhu;

9,19,130.0,"Ubiquitin-like proteins (UBLs) can change protein function, localization or turnover by covalent attachment to lysine residues(1). Although UBLs achieve this conjugation through an intricate enzymatic cascade, their bacterial counterparts MoaD and ThiS function as sulphur carrier proteins(2,3). Here we show that Urm1p, the most ancient UBL3, acts as a sulphur carrier in the process of eukaryotic transfer RNA ( tRNA) modification, providing a possible evolutionary link between UBL and sulphur transfer. Moreover, we identify Uba4p, Ncs2p, Ncs6p and Yor251cp as components of this conserved pathway. Using in vitro assays, we show that Ncs6p binds to tRNA, whereas Uba4p first adenylates and then directly transfers sulphur onto Urm1p. Finally, functional analysis reveals that the thiolation function of Urm1p is critical to regulate cellular responses to nutrient starvation and oxidative stress conditions, most likely by increasing translation fidelity.","Leidel, Sebastian; Pedrioli, Patrick G.

10,110,279.0,"Transcription factors bind in a combinatorial fashion to specify the on-and-off states of genes; the ensemble of these binding events forms a regulatory network, constituting the wiring diagram for a cell. To examine the principles of the human transcriptional regulatory network, we determined the genomic binding information of 119 transcription-related factors in over 450 distinct experiments. We found the combinatorial, co-association of transcription factors to be highly context specific: distinct combinations of factors bind at specific genomic locations. In particular, there are significant differences in the binding proximal and distal to genes. We organized all the transcription factor binding into a hierarchy and integrated it with other genomic information (for example, microRNA regulation), forming a dense meta-network. Factors at different levels have different properties; for instance, top-level transcription factors more strongly influence expression and middle-level ones co-regulate targets to mitigate information-flow bottlenecks. Moreover, these co-regulations give rise to many enriched network motifs (for example, noise-buffering feed-forward loops). Finally, more connected network components are under stronger selection and exhibit a greater degree of allele-specific activity (that is, differential binding to the two parental alleles). The regulatory information obtained in this study will be crucial for interpreting personal genome sequences and understanding basic principles of human biology and disease.","Gerstein, Mark B.; Kundaje, Anshul; Hariharan, Manoj; Landt, Stephen G.; Yan, Koon-Kiu; Cheng, Chao; Mu, Xinmeng Jasmine; Khurana, Ekta; Rozowsky, Joel; Alexander, Roger; Min, Renqiang; Alves, Pedro; Abyzov, Alexej; Addleman, Nick; Bhardwaj, Nitin; Boyle, Alan P.; Cayting, Philip; Charos, Alexandra; Chen, David Z.; Cheng, Yong; Clarke, Declan; Eastman, Catharine; Euskirchen, Ghia; Frietze, Seth; Fu, Yao; Gertz, Jason; Grubert, Fabian; Harmanci, Arif; Jain, Preti; Kasowski, Maya; Lacroute, Phil; Leng, Jing; Lian, Jin; Monahan, Hannah; O'Geen, Henriette; Ouyang, Zhengqing; Partridge, E.

11,37,238.0,"The mass and chemical composition of a star are the primary determinants of its basic physical properties - radius, temperature and luminosity - and how those properties evolve with time(1). Accordingly, two stars born at the same time, from the same natal material and with the same mass, are 'identical twins,' and as such might be expected to possess identical physical attributes. We have discovered in the Orion nebula a pair of stellar twins in a newborn binary star system(2). Each star in the binary has a mass of 0.41 +/- 0.01 solar masses, identical to within 2 per cent. Here we report that these twin stars have surface temperatures differing by similar to 300 K (similar to 10 per cent) and luminosities differing by similar to 50 per cent, both at high confidence level. Preliminary results indicate that the stars' radii also differ, by 5 - 10 per cent. These surprising dissimilarities suggest that one of the twins may have been delayed by several hundred thousand years in its formation relative to its sibling. Such a delay could only have been detected in a very young, definitively equal-mass binary system(3). Our findings reveal cosmic limits on the age synchronization of young binary stars, often used as tests for the age calibrations of star-formation models(4).","Stassun, Keivan G.; Mathieu, Robert D.; Cargile, Phillip A.; Aarnio, Alicia N.; Stempels, Eric; Geller, Aaron","Stassun, KG; Mathieu, RD; Cargile, PA; Aarnio, AN; Stempels, E; Geller, A",1079.0,"[Stassun, Keivan G.; Cargile, Phillip A.; Aarnio, Alicia N.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Mathieu, Robert D.; Geller, Aaron] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Astron, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Stempels, Eric] Univ St Andrews, Sch Phys & Astron, St Andrews KY16 9SS, Fife, Scotland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07069,Article,,keivan.stassun@vanderbilt.edu,1082,,,314WM,,,ORION NEBULA CLUSTER; SEQUENCE ECLIPSING BINARY; LOW-MASS; ABSOLUTE CALIBRATION; FORMING REGION; BROWN DWARFS; SYSTEM; 2MASS; TEMPERATURES; PHOTOMETRY,7198.0,NATURE,Nature,English,29.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",19-Jun,4.0,LONDON,18563159.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,,"Stassun, KG (reprint author), Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,39.0,Surprising dissimilarities in a newly formed pair of 'identical twin' stars,0.0,3.0,WOS:000256839900051,238.0,453,Multidisciplinary Sciences,40,aaron,geller,1008.0,2280,male,1.0,PyNOB1EAAAAJ,1,"[0, 1474]",34068800,1,5923637,1,Laura Geller,Laura Geller,1,1
12,112,301.0,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are highly prevalent neurodevelopmental disorders(1), but the underlying pathogenesis remains poorly understood. Recent studies have implicated the cerebellum in these disorders, with post-mortem studies in ASD patients showing cerebellar Purkinje cell (PC) loss(2,3), and isolated cerebellar injury has been associated with a higher incidence of ASDs(4). However, the extent of cerebellar contribution to the pathogenesis of ASDs remains unclear. Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disorder with high rates of comorbid ASDs(5) that result from mutation of either TSC1 or TSC2, whose protein products dimerize and negatively regulate mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling. TSC is an intriguing model to investigate the cerebellar contribution to the underlying pathogenesis of ASDs, as recent studies in TSC patients demonstrate cerebellar pathology(6) and correlate cerebellar pathology with increased ASD symptomatology(7,8). Functional imaging also shows that TSC patients with ASDs display hypermetabolism in deep cerebellar structures, compared to TSC patients without ASDs(9). However, the roles of Tsc1 and the sequelae of Tsc1 dysfunction in the cerebellum have not been investigated so far. Here we show that both heterozygous and homozygous loss of Tsc1 in mouse cerebellar PCs results in autistic-like behaviours, including abnormal social interaction, repetitive behaviour and vocalizations, in addition to decreased PC excitability. Treatment of mutant mice with the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, prevented the pathological and behavioural deficits. These findings demonstrate new roles for Tsc1 in PC function and define a molecular basis for a cerebellar contribution to cognitive disorders such as autism.","Tsai, Peter T.; Hull, Court; Chu, YunXiang; Greene-Colozzi, Emily; Sadowski, Abbey R.; Leech, Jarrett M.; Steinberg, Jason; Crawley, Jacqueline N.; Regehr, Wade G.; Sahin, Mustafa","Tsai, PT; Hull, C; Chu, YX; Greene-Colozzi, E; Sadowski, AR; Leech, JM; Steinberg, J; Crawley, JN; Regehr, WG; Sahin, M",647.0,"[Tsai, Peter T.; Greene-Colozzi, Emily; Sadowski, Abbey R.; Leech, Jarrett M.; Steinberg, Jason; Sahin, Mustafa] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston Childrens Hosp, FM Kirby Neurobiol Ctr,Dept Neurol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Hull, Court; Chu, YunXiang; Regehr, Wade G.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Crawley, Jacqueline N.] NIMH, Lab Behav Neurosci, Intramural Res Program, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11310,Article,,peter.tsai@childrens.harvard.edu; mustafa.sahin@childrens.harvard.edu,+,"Developmental Neurology Training grant [T32 NS007473]; American Academy of Neurology; Nancy Lurie Marks Family Foundation; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R01 NS58956]; John Merck Scholars Fund; Autism Speaks; Boston Children's Hospital Translational Research Program; Manton Center for Orphan Disease Research; Boston Children's Hospital Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center [P30 HD18655]; Intramural Research Program, National Institute of Mental Health; NIH [R01NS032405]; Simons Foundation [SFARI 232304]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute Medical Research Fellowship","We thank G.

13,20,144.0,"Investigating proteins 'at work' in a living environment at atomic resolution is a major goal of molecular biology, which has not been achieved even though methods for the three-dimensional (3D) structure determination of purified proteins in single crystals or in solution are widely used. Recent developments in NMR hardware and methodology have enabled the measurement of high-resolution heteronuclear multi-dimensional NMR spectra of macromolecules in living cells (in-cell NMR)(1-5). Various intracellular events such as conformational changes, dynamics and binding events have been investigated by this method. However, the low sensitivity and the short lifetime of the samples have so far prevented the acquisition of sufficient structural information to determine protein structures by in-cell NMR. Here we show the first, to our knowledge, 3D protein structure calculated exclusively on the basis of information obtained in living cells. The structure of the putative heavy-metal binding protein TTHA1718 from Thermus thermophilus HB8 overexpressed in Escherichia coli cells was solved by in-cell NMR. Rapid measurement of the 3D NMR spectra by nonlinear sampling of the indirectly acquired dimensions was used to overcome problems caused by the instability and low sensitivity of living E. coli samples. Almost all of the expected backbone NMR resonances and most of the side-chain NMR resonances were observed and assigned, enabling high quality (0.96 angstrom backbone root mean squared deviation) structures to be calculated that are very similar to the in vitro structure of TTHA1718 determined independently. The in-cell NMR approach can thus provide accurate high-resolution structures of proteins in living environments.","Sakakibara, Daisuke; Sasaki, Atsuko; Ikeya, Teppei; Hamatsu, Junpei; Hanashima, Tomomi; Mishima, Masaki; Yoshimasu, Masatoshi; Hayashi, Nobuhiro; Mikawa, Tsutomu; Waelchli, Markus; Smith, Brian O.; Shirakawa, Masahiro; Guentert, Peter; Ito, Yutaka","Sakakibara, D; Sasaki, A; Ikeya, T; Hamatsu, J; Hanashima, T; Mishima, M; Yoshimasu, M; Hayashi, N; Mikawa, T; Walchli, M; Smith, BO; Shirakawa, M; Guntert, P; Ito, Y",102.0,"[Sakakibara, Daisuke; Sasaki, Atsuko; Ikeya, Teppei; Hamatsu, Junpei; Hanashima, Tomomi; Mishima, Masaki; Guentert, Peter; Ito, Yutaka] Tokyo Metropolitan Univ, Dept Chem, Tokyo 1920397, Japan; [Sakakibara, Daisuke; Sasaki, Atsuko; Hamatsu, Junpei; Mishima, Masaki; Shirakawa, Masahiro; Ito, Yutaka] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, CREST, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; [Ikeya, Teppei; Guentert, Peter] Univ Frankfurt, Inst Biophys Chem, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany; [Ikeya, Teppei; Guentert, Peter] Univ Frankfurt, Ctr Biomol Magnet Resonance, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany; [Yoshimasu, Masatoshi] RIKEN, Cellular & Mol Biol Lab, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Hayashi, Nobuhiro] Fujita Hlth Univ, Inst Comprehens Med Sci, Div Biomed Polymer Sci, Toyoake, Aichi 4701192, Japan; [Mikawa, Tsutomu; Ito, Yutaka] RIKEN, Res Grp Biosupramol Struct Funct, Tsurumi Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Waelchli, Markus] Bruker BioSpin, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050051, Japan; [Smith, Brian O.] Univ Glasgow, Fac Biomed & Life Sci, Div Mol & Cellular Biol, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Shirakawa, Masahiro] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Mol Engn, Nishikyo Ku, Kyoto 6158510, Japan; [Guentert, Peter] Frankfurt Inst Adv Studies, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07814,Article,,ito-yutaka@tmu.ac.jp,U10,"CREST, Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST); Molecular Ensemble Program, RIKEN; Japanese Ministry of Education, Sports, Culture, Science, and Technology; Volkswagen Foundation;  [TTHA1718]","The authors thank S.

14,66,350.0,"Soils of the northern high latitudes store carbon over millennial timescales (thousands of years) and contain approximately double the carbon stock of the atmosphere(1-3). Warming and associated permafrost thaw can expose soil organic carbon and result in mineralization and carbon dioxide (CO2) release(4-6). However, some of this soil organic carbon may be eroded and transferred to rivers(7-9). If it escapes degradation during river transport and is buried in marine sediments, then it can contribute to a longer-term (more than ten thousand years), geological CO2 sink(8-10). Despite this recognition, the erosional flux and fate of particulate organic carbon (POC) in large rivers at high latitudes remains poorly constrained. Here, we quantify the source of POC in the Mackenzie River, the main sediment supplier to the Arctic Ocean(11,12), and assess its flux and fate. We combine measurements of radiocarbon, stable carbon isotopes and element ratios to correct for rock-derived POC10,13,14. Our samples reveal that the eroded biospheric POC has resided in the basin for millennia, with a mean radiocarbon age of 5,800 +/- 800 years, much older than the POC in large tropical rivers(13,14). From the measured biospheric POC content and variability in annual sediment yield(15), we calculate a biospheric POC flux of 2.2(-0.9)(+1.3) teragrams of carbon per year from the Mackenzie River, which is three times the CO2 drawdown by silicate weathering in this basin(16). Offshore, we find evidence for efficient terrestrial organic carbon burial over the Holocene period, suggesting that erosion of organic carbon-rich, high-latitude soils may result in an important geological CO2 sink.","Hilton, Robert G.; Galy, Valier; Gaillardet, Jerome; Dellinger, Mathieu; Bryant, Charlotte; O'Regan, Matt; Groecke, Darren R.; Coxall, Helen; Bouchez, Julien; Calmels, Damien","Hilton, RG; Galy, V; Gaillardet, J; Dellinger, M; Bryant, C; O'Regan, M; Grocke, DR; Coxall, H; Bouchez, J; Calmels, D",84.0,"[Hilton, Robert G.] Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Durham DH1 3LE, England; [Galy, Valier] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Marine Chem & Geochem, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Gaillardet, Jerome; Dellinger, Mathieu; Bouchez, Julien] Univ Paris Diderot, Inst Phys Globe Paris, Sorbonne Paris Cite, UMR CNRS 7154, F-75005 Paris, France; [Bryant, Charlotte] NERC Radiocarbon Facil, E Kilbride G75 OQF, Lanark, Scotland; [O'Regan, Matt; Coxall, Helen] Stockholm Univ, Dept Geol Sci, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Groecke, Darren R.] Univ Durham, Dept Earth Sci, Durham DH1 3LE, England; [Calmels, Damien] Univ Paris 11, Lab GEOPS, UMR CNRS 8148, F-91405 Orsay, France",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14653,Article,1476-4687,r.g.hilton@durham.ac.uk,U162,"Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), UK [1611.0312]; CNRS (OXYMORE); CNRS (CANNIBALT); Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Arctic Research Initiative; Early Career Research Grant by the British Society for Geomorphology; US National Science Foundation [OCE-0928582]; Royal Society University Fellowship","Radiocarbon measurements were funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), UK (Allocation 1611.0312) to R.G.H and C.B.

It is the basis for a variety of circuits and devices, with applications ranging from medicine(2) to quantum information(3). Experiments using Josephson circuits that behave like artificial atoms(4) are now revolutionizing the way we probe and exploit the laws of quantum physics(5,6). Microscopically, the supercurrent is carried by Andreev pair states, which are localized at the weak link. These states come in doublets and have energies inside the superconducting gap(7-10). Existing Josephson circuits are based on properties of just the ground state of each doublet, and so far the excited states have not been directly detected. Here we establish their existence through spectroscopic measurements of superconducting atomic contacts. The spectra, which depend on the atomic configuration and on the phase difference between the superconductors, are in complete agreement with theory. Andreev doublets could be exploited to encode information in novel types of superconducting qubits(11-13).","Bretheau, L.; Girit, C.

16,46,202.0,"Somatic alterations in cellular DNA underlie almost all human cancers(1). The prospect of targeted therapies(2) and the development of high-resolution, genome-wide approaches(3-8) are now spurring systematic efforts to characterize cancer genomes. Here we report a large-scale project to characterize copy-number alterations in primary lung adenocarcinomas. By analysis of a large collection of tumours ( n = 371) using dense single nucleotide polymorphism arrays, we identify a total of 57 significantly recurrent events. We find that 26 of 39 autosomal chromosome arms show consistent large-scale copy-number gain or loss, of which only a handful have been linked to a specific gene. We also identify 31 recurrent focal events, including 24 amplifications and 7 homozygous deletions. Only six of these focal events are currently associated with known mutations in lung carcinomas. The most common event, amplification of chromosome 14q13.3, is found in similar to 12% of samples. On the basis of genomic and functional analyses, we identify NKX2-1 ( NK2 homeobox 1, also called TITF1), which lies in the minimal 14q13.3 amplification interval and encodes a lineage-specific transcription factor, as a novel candidate proto-oncogene involved in a significant fraction of lung adenocarcinomas. More generally, our results indicate that many of the genes that are involved in lung adenocarcinoma remain to be discovered.","Weir, Barbara A.; Woo, Michele S.; Getz, Gad; Perner, Sven; Ding, Li; Beroukhim, Rameen; Lin, William M.; Province, Michael A.; Kraja, Aldi; Johnson, Laura A.; Shah, Kinjal; Sato, Mitsuo; Thomas, Roman K.; Barletta, Justine A.; Borecki, Ingrid B.; Broderick, Stephen; Chang, Andrew C.; Chiang, Derek Y.; Chirieac, Lucian R.; Cho, Jeonghee; Fujii, Yoshitaka; Gazdar, Adi F.; Giordano, Thomas; Greulich, Heidi; Hanna, Megan; Johnson, Bruce E.; Kris, Mark G.; Lash, Alex; Lin, Ling; Lindeman, Neal; Mardis, Elaine R.; McPherson, John D.; Minna, John D.; Morgan, Margaret B.; Nadel, Mark; Orringer, Mark B.; Osborne, John R.; Ozenberger, Brad; Ramos, Alex H.; Robinson, James; Roth, Jack A.; Rusch, Valerie; Sasaki, Hidefumi; Shepherd, Frances; Sougnez, Carrie; Spitz, Margaret R.; Tsao, Ming-Sound; Twomey, David; Verhaak, Roel G.

17,6,81.0,"Transcription of eukaryotic messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding genes by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is triggered by the binding of transactivating proteins to enhancer DNA, which stimulates the recruitment of general transcription factors (TFIIA, B, D, E, F, H) and Pol II on the cis-linked promoter, leading to pre-initiation complex formation and transcription(1). In TFIID-dependent activation pathways, this general transcription factor containing TATA-box-binding protein is first recruited on the promoter through interaction with activators(1-3) and cooperates with TFIIA to form a committed pre-initiation complex(4). However, neither the mechanisms by which activation signals are communicated between these factors nor the structural organization of the activated pre-initiation complex are known. Here we used cryo-electron microscopy to determine the architecture of nucleoprotein complexes composed of TFIID, TFIIA, the transcriptional activator Rap1 and yeast enhancer-promoter DNA. These structures revealed the mode of binding of Rap1 and TFIIA to TFIID, as well as a reorganization of TFIIA induced by its interaction with Rap1. We propose that this change in position increases the exposure of TATA-box-binding protein within TFIID, consequently enhancing its ability to interact with the promoter. A large Rap1-dependent DNA loop forms between the activator-binding site and the proximal promoter region. This loop is topologically locked by a TFIIA-Rap1 protein bridge that folds over the DNA. These results highlight the role of TFIIA in transcriptional activation, define a molecular mechanism for enhancer-promoter communication and provide structural insights into the pathways of intramolecular communication that convey transcription activation signals through the TFIID complex.","Papai, Gabor; Tripathi, Manish K.; Ruhlmann, Christine; Layer, Justin H.; Weil, P.

18,42,382.0,"Bacteriophage lambda has for many years been a model system for understanding mechanisms of gene regulation(1). A 'genetic switch' enables the phage to transition from lysogenic growth to lytic development when triggered by specific environmental conditions. The key component of the switch is the cI repressor, which binds to two sets of three operator sites on the lambda chromosome that are separated by about 2,400 base pairs (bp)(2,3). A hallmark of the lambda system is the pairwise cooperativity of repressor binding(4). In the absence of detailed structural information, it has been difficult to understand fully how repressor molecules establish the cooperativity complex. Here we present the X- ray crystal structure of the intact lambda cI repressor dimer bound to a DNA operator site. The structure of the repressor, determined by multiple isomorphous replacement methods, reveals an unusual overall architecture that allows it to adopt a conformation that appears to facilitate pairwise cooperative binding to adjacent operator sites.","Stayrook, Steven; Jaru-Ampornpan, Peera; Ni, Jenny; Hochschild, Ann; Lewis, Mitchell","Stayrook, S; Jaru-Ampornpan, P; Ni, J; Hochschild, A; Lewis, M",1022.0,"[Stayrook, Steven; Jaru-Ampornpan, Peera; Ni, Jenny; Lewis, Mitchell] Univ Penn, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Philadelphia, PA 19102 USA; [Hochschild, Ann] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Mol Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06831,Article,,lewis@mail.med.upenn.edu,U12,NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM044025],,291PF,,,BACTERIOPHAGE-LAMBDA; LEXA; CLEAVAGE; DOMAIN; CRYSTALLOGRAPHY; RECOGNITION; PROTEIN; DIMERS,7190.0,NATURE,Nature,English,23.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",24-Apr,5.0,LONDON,18432246.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,,"Lewis, M (reprint author), Univ Penn, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Biophys, 37th & Hamilton Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19102 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,49.0,Crystal structure of the lambda repressor and a model for pairwise cooperative operator binding,1.0,10.0,WOS:000255208600045,382.0,452,Multidisciplinary Sciences,49,mitchell,lewis,534.0,345,male,0.99,Gy-X2vgAAAAJ,1,"[0, 1474]",13937844,1,46310693,1,Mitchell Lewis,Mitchell Lewis,1,1
19,54,62.0,"The formation of relativistic jets by an accreting compact object is one of the fundamental mysteries of astrophysics. Although the theory is poorly understood, observations of relativistic jets from systems known as microquasars (compact binary stars)(1,2) have led to a well established phenomenology(3,4). Relativistic jets are not expected to be produced by sources with soft or supersoft X-ray spectra, although two such systems are known to produce relatively low-velocity bipolar outflows(5,6). Here we report the optical spectra of an ultraluminous supersoft X-ray source (ULS7,8) in the nearby galaxy M81 (M81 ULS-1; refs 9, 10). Unexpectedly, the spectra show blueshifted, broad H alpha emission lines, characteristic of baryonic jets with relativistic speeds. These time-variable emission lines have projected velocities of about 17 per cent of the speed of light, and seem to be similar to those from the prototype microquasar SS 433 (refs 11, 12). Such relativistic jets are not expected to be launched from white dwarfs(13), and an origin from a black hole or a neutron star is hard to reconcile with the persistence of M81 ULS-1's soft X-rays(10). Thus the unexpected presence of relativistic jets in a ULS challenges canonical theories of jet formation(3,4), but might be explained by a long-speculated, supercritically accreting black hole with optically thick outflows(14-20).","Liu, Ji-Feng; Bai, Yu; Wang, Song; Justham, Stephen; Lu, You-Jun; Gu, Wei-Min; Liu, Qing-Zhong; Di Stefano, Rosanne; Guo, Jin-Cheng; Cabrera-Lavers, Antonio; Alvarez, Pedro; Cao, Yi; Kulkarni, Shri","Liu, JF; Bai, Y; Wang, S; Justham, S; Lu, YJ; Gu, WM; Liu, QZ; Di Stefano, R; Guo, JC; Cabrera-Lavers, A; Alvarez, P; Cao, Y; Kulkarni, S",108.0,"[Liu, Ji-Feng; Bai, Yu; Wang, Song; Justham, Stephen; Lu, You-Jun; Guo, Jin-Cheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Natl Astron Observ, Key Lab Opt Astron, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China; [Liu, Ji-Feng; Justham, Stephen; Lu, You-Jun] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Astron & Space Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Gu, Wei-Min] Xiamen Univ, Dept Astron, Xiamen 361005, Fujian Province, Peoples R China; [Liu, Qing-Zhong] Chinese Acad Sci, Purple Mt Observ, Key Lab Dark Matter & Space Astron, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Di Stefano, Rosanne] Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Cabrera-Lavers, Antonio; Alvarez, Pedro] Inst Astrofis Canarias, E-38200 San Cristobal la Laguna, Tenerife, Spain; [Cabrera-Lavers, Antonio; Alvarez, Pedro] Univ La Laguna, Dept Astrofis, E-38205 San Cristobal la Laguna, Tenerife, Spain; [Cao, Yi; Kulkarni, Shri] CALTECH, Dept Astron, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15751,Article,1476-4687,jfliu@nao.cas.cn,+,Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB09000000]; 973 Program [2014CB845705]; National Science Foundation of China [NSFC-11333004/11425313]; W.M.

20,80,251.0,"The urban heat island(UHI), a common phenomenon in which surface temperatures are higher in urban areas than in surrounding rural areas, represents one of the most significant human-induced changes to Earth's surface climate(1,2). Even though they are localized hotspots in the landscape, UHIs have a profound impact on the lives of urban residents, who comprise more than half of the world's population(3). A barrier to UHI mitigation is the lack of quantitative attribution of the various contributions to UHI intensity(4) (expressed as the temperature difference between urban and rural areas, Delta T). A common perception is that reduction in evaporative cooling in urban land is the dominant driver of DT (ref. 5). Here we use a climate model to show that, for cities across North America, geographic variations in daytime Delta T are largely explained by variations in the efficiency with which urban and rural areas convect heat to the lower atmosphere. If urban areas are aerodynamically smoother than surrounding rural areas, urban heat dissipation is relatively less efficient and urban warming occurs (and vice versa). This convection effect depends on the local background climate, increasing daytime Delta T by 3.06 +/- 0.3 kelvin (mean and standard error) in humid climates but decreasing Delta T by 1.5 +/- 0.2 kelvin in dry climates. In the humid eastern United States, there is evidence of higher Delta T in drier years. These relationship simply that UHIs will exacerbate heat wave stress on human health in wet climates where high temperature effects are already compounded by high air humidity(6,7) and in drier years when positive temperature anomalies may be reinforced by a precipitation temperature feedback(8). Our results support albedo management as a viable means of reducing Delta T on large scales(9,10).","Zhao, Lei; Lee, Xuhui; Smith, Ronald B.; Oleson, Keith","Zhao, L; Lee, X; Smith, RB; Oleson, K",216.0,"[Zhao, Lei; Lee, Xuhui] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Yale NUIST Ctr Atmospher Environm, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Lei; Lee, Xuhui] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Smith, Ronald B.] Yale Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Oleson, Keith] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80305 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13462,Article,1476-4687,xuhui.lee@yale.edu,219,Ministry of Education of China (grant PCSIRT); Yale Climate and Energy Institute; Yale Institute of Biospheric Studies; Yale University Graduate Fellowship; NASA [NNX10AK79G]; NCARWCIASP; US National Science Foundation,"This research was supported by the Ministry of Education of China (grant PCSIRT), the Yale Climate and Energy Institute, the Yale Institute of Biospheric Studies, and a Yale University Graduate Fellowship.

21,98,229.0,"The detection of electron spins associated with single defects in solids is a critical operation for a range of quantum information and measurement applications under development(1-9). So far, it has been accomplished for only two defect centres in crystalline solids: phosphorus dopants in silicon, for which electrical read-out based on a single-electron transistor is used(1), and nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond, for which optical read-out is used(4-6). A spin readout fidelity of about 90 per cent has been demonstrated with both electrical read-out(1) and optical read-out(10,11); however, the thermal limitations of the former and the poor photon collection efficiency of the latter make it difficult to achieve the higher fidelities required for quantum information applications. Here we demonstrate a hybrid approach in which optical excitation is used to change the charge state (conditional on its spin state) of an erbium defect centre in a silicon-based single-electron transistor, and this change is then detected electrically. The high spectral resolution of the optical frequency-addressing step overcomes the thermal broadening limitation of the previous electrical read-out scheme, and the charge-sensing step avoids the difficulties of efficient photon collection. This approach could lead to new architectures for quantum information processing devices and could drastically increase the range of defect centres that can be exploited. Furthermore, the efficient electrical detection of the optical excitation of single sites in silicon represents a significant step towards developing interconnects between optical-based quantum computing and silicon technologies.","Yin, Chunming; Rancic, Milos; de Boo, Gabriele G.; Stavrias, Nikolas; McCallum, Jeffrey C.; Sellars, Matthew J.; Rogge, Sven","Yin, CM; Rancic, M; de Boo, GG; Stavrias, N; McCallum, JC; Sellars, MJ; Rogge, S",91.0,"[Yin, Chunming; de Boo, Gabriele G.; Rogge, Sven] Univ New S Wales, Sch Phys, Ctr Excellence Quantum Computat & Commun Technol, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Rancic, Milos; Sellars, Matthew J.] Australian Natl Univ, RSPE, Ctr Excellence Quantum Computat & Commun Technol, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Stavrias, Nikolas; McCallum, Jeffrey C.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Phys, Ctr Excellence Quantum Computat & Commun Technol, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12081,Article,1476-4687,s.rogge@unsw.edu.au,94,"ARC Centre of Excellence for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology [CE110001027]; Future Fellowships [FT100100589, FT110100919]","We thank R.

22,124,262.0,"The manipulation of light-matter interactions by quantum control of atomic levels has had a profound impact on optical sciences. Such manipulation has many applications, including nonlinear optics at the few-photon level(1-3), slow light(4,5), lasing without inversion(6-8) and optical quantum information processing(9,10). The critical underlying technique is electromagnetically induced transparency, in which quantum interference between transitions in multilevel atoms(11-15) renders an opaque medium transparent near an atomic resonance. With the advent of high-brilliance, accelerator-driven light sources such as storage rings or X-ray lasers, it has become attractive to extend the techniques of optical quantum control to the X-ray regime(16,17). Here we demonstrate electromagnetically induced transparency in the regime of hard X-rays, using the 14.4-kiloelectronvolt nuclear resonance of the Mossbauer isotope iron-57 (a two-level system). We exploit cooperative emission from ensembles of the nuclei, which are embedded in a low-finesse cavity and excited by synchrotron radiation. The spatial modulation of the photonic density of states in a cavity mode leads to the coexistence of superradiant and subradiant states of nuclei, respectively located at an antinode and a node of the cavity field. This scheme causes the nuclei to behave as effective three-level systems, with two degenerate levels in the excited state (one of which can be considered metastable). The radiative coupling of the nuclear ensembles by the cavity field establishes the atomic coherence necessary for the cancellation of resonant absorption. Because this technique does not require atomic systems with a metastable level, electromagnetically induced transparency and its applications can be transferred to the regime of nuclear resonances, establishing the field of nuclear quantum optics.","Roehlsberger, Ralf; Wille, Hans-Christian; Schlage, Kai; Sahoo, Balaram","Rohlsberger, R; Wille, HC; Schlage, K; Sahoo, B",199.0,"[Roehlsberger, Ralf; Wille, Hans-Christian; Schlage, Kai; Sahoo, Balaram] Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron, D-22607 Hamburg, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10741,Article,1476-4687,ralf.roehlsberger@desy.de,203,,,888HI,,,POPULATION-INVERSION; LASER OSCILLATION; ATOMIC GAS; OPTICS,7384.0,NATURE,Nature,English,29.0,No,"Sahoo, Balaram/0000-0002-2050-4746; Rohlsberger, Ralf/0000-0001-6005-5183; Wille, Hans-Christian/0000-0003-0851-3831","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",9-Feb,5.0,LONDON,22318603.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2012.0,"Sahoo, Balaram/E-4828-2011; Wille, Hans-Christian/C-3881-2013; Rohlsberger, Ralf/J-4173-2013","Rohlsberger, R (reprint author), Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron, Notkestr 85, D-22607 Hamburg, Germany.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,80.0,Electromagnetically induced transparency with resonant nuclei in a cavity,3.0,63.0,WOS:000299994100034,262.0,482,Multidisciplinary Sciences,80,balaram,sahoo,806.0,3,male,1.0,6cDBwBEAAAAJ,1,"[0, 1474]",44231522,1,4773382,1,Orthosilicate (ion),Orthosilicate (ion),0,0
23,114,346.0,"Silicon transistors are expected to have new gate architectures, channel materials and switching mechanisms in ten years' time(1-4). The trend in transistor scaling has already led to a change in gate structure from two dimensions to three, used in fin field-effect transistors, to avoid problems inherent in miniaturization such as high off-state leakage current and the short-channel effect. At present, planar and fin architectures using III-V materials, specifically InGaAs, are being explored as alternative fast channels on silicon(5-9) because of their high electron mobility and high-quality interface with gate dielectrics(10). The idea of surrounding-gate transistors(11), in which the gate is wrapped around a nanowire channel to provide the best possible electrostatic gate control, using InGaAs channels on silicon, however, has been less well investigated(12,13) because of difficulties in integrating free-standing InGaAs nanostructures on silicon. Here we report the position-controlled growth of vertical InGaAs nanowires on silicon without any buffering technique and demonstrate surrounding-gate transistors using InGaAs nanowires and InGaAs/InP/InAlAs/InGaAs core-multishell nanowires as channels. Surrounding-gate transistors using core-multishell nanowire channels with a six-sided, high-electron-mobility transistor structure greatly enhance the on-state current and transconductance while keeping good gate controllability. These devices provide a route to making vertically oriented transistors for the next generation of field-effect transistors and may be useful as building blocks for wireless networks on silicon platforms.","Tomioka, Katsuhiro; Yoshimura, Masatoshi; Fukui, Takashi","Tomioka, K; Yoshimura, M; Fukui, T",189.0,"[Tomioka, Katsuhiro; Yoshimura, Masatoshi; Fukui, Takashi] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608628, Japan; [Tomioka, Katsuhiro; Yoshimura, Masatoshi; Fukui, Takashi] Hokkaido Univ, RCIQE, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608628, Japan; [Tomioka, Katsuhiro] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy PRESTO, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11293,Article,,tomioka@rciqe.hokudai.ac.jp,+,MEXT; Japan Science and Technology Agency - PRESTO programme,"We thank J.

24,31,403.0,"Xeroderma pigmentosum is a monogenic disease characterized by hypersensitivity to ultraviolet light. The cells of xeroderma pigmentosum patients are defective in nucleotide excision repair, limiting their capacity to eliminate ultraviolet- induced DNA damage, and resulting in a strong predisposition to develop skin cancers(1). The use of rare cutting DNA endonucleases - such as homing endonucleases, also known as meganucleases - constitutes one possible strategy for repairing DNA lesions. Homing endonucleases have emerged as highly specific molecular scalpels that recognize and cleave DNA sites, promoting efficient homologous gene targeting through double- strand- break- induced homologous recombination. Here we describe two engineered heterodimeric derivatives of the homing endonuclease I- CreI, produced by a semi- rational approach. These two molecules - Amel3 - Amel4 and Ini3 - Ini4 cleave DNA from the human XPC gene ( xeroderma pigmentosum group C), in vitro and in vivo. Crystal structures of the I- CreI variants complexed with intact and cleaved XPC target DNA suggest that the mechanism of DNA recognition and cleavage by the engineered homing endonucleases is similar to that of the wild- type I- CreI. Furthermore, these derivatives induced high levels of specific gene targeting in mammalian cells while displaying no obvious genotoxicity. Thus, homing endonucleases can be designed to recognize and cleave the DNA sequences of specific genes, opening up new possibilities for genome engineering and gene therapy in xeroderma pigmentosum patients whose illness can be treated ex vivo.","Redondo, Pilar; Prieto, Jesus; Munoz, Ines G.; Alibes, Andreu; Stricher, Francois; Serrano, Luis; Cabaniols, Jean-Pierre; Daboussi, Fayza; Arnould, Sylvain; Perez, Christophe; Duchateau, Philippe; Paques, Frederic; Blanco, Francisco J.; Montoya, Guillermo","Redondo, P; Prieto, J; Munoz, IG; Alibes, A; Stricher, F; Serrano, L; Cabaniols, JP; Daboussi, F; Arnould, S; Perez, C; Duchateau, P; Paques, F; Blanco, FJ; Montoya, G",107.0,"[Redondo, Pilar; Munoz, Ines G.; Montoya, Guillermo] Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, Struct Biol & Biocomp Programme, Macromol Crystallog Grp, Madrid 28029, Spain; [Prieto, Jesus; Blanco, Francisco J.] Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, Struct Biol & Biocomp Programme, NMR Grp, Madrid 28029, Spain; [Alibes, Andreu; Stricher, Francois; Serrano, Luis] UPF, European Mol Biol Lab, CRG Syst Biol Unit, CRG, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Serrano, Luis] ICREA, F-93235 Romainville, France; [Cabaniols, Jean-Pierre; Daboussi, Fayza; Arnould, Sylvain; Perez, Christophe; Duchateau, Philippe; Paques, Frederic] CELLECTIS SA, F-93235 Romainville, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07343,Article,,fblanco@cicbiogune.es; gmontoya@cnio.es,U8,EU MEGATOOL [LSHG-CT-2006-037226]; CRG-Novartis fellowship,We would like to thank J.

25,18,77.0,"Geological mapping and geochronological studies have shown much lower eruption rates for ocean island basalts (OIBs) in comparison with those of lavas from large igneous provinces (LIPs) such as oceanic plateaux and continental flood provinces(1). However, a quantitative petrological comparison has never been made between mantle source temperature and the extent of melting for OIB and LIP sources. Here we show that the MgO and FeO contents of Galapagos related lavas and their primary magmas have decreased since the Cretaceous period. From petrological modelling(2), we infer that these changes reflect a cooling of the Galapagos mantle plume from a potential temperature of 1,560-1,620 degrees C in the Cretaceous to 1,500 degrees C at present. Iceland also exhibits secular cooling, in agreement with previous studies(3,4). Our work provides quantitative petrological evidence that, in general, mantle plumes for LIPs with Palaeocene-Permian ages were hotter and melted more extensively than plumes of more modern ocean islands. We interpret this to reflect episodic flow from lower-mantle domains that are lithologically and geochemically heterogeneous.","Herzberg, Claude; Gazel, Esteban","Herzberg, C; Gazel, E",619.0,"[Herzberg, Claude; Gazel, Esteban] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07857,Article,,herzberg@rci.rutgers.edu,U83,,,427RK,,,ATLANTIC IGNEOUS PROVINCE; FLOOD BASALTS; TECTONIC EVOLUTION; THERMAL STRUCTURE; OCEANIC PLATEAUS; MELT GENERATION; LITHOSPHERE; CONSTRAINTS; GREENLAND; VOLCANISM,7238.0,NATURE,Nature,English,35.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2-Apr,5.0,LONDON,19340079.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2009.0,"Gazel, Esteban/B-8090-2012","Herzberg, C (reprint author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, 610 Taylor Rd, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,106.0,Petrological evidence for secular cooling in mantle plumes,3.0,46.0,WOS:000264796200038,77.0,458,Multidisciplinary Sciences,106,esteban,gazel,807.0,495,male,1.0,RwEXWNoAAAAJ,1,"[0, 1474]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0

These prototypical opioids produce analgesia as well as many undesirable side effects (sedation, apnoea and dependence) by binding to and activating the G-protein-coupled mu-opioid receptor (mu-OR) in the central nervous system. Here we describe the 2.8 angstrom crystal structure of the mouse mu-OR in complex with an irreversible morphinan antagonist. Compared to the buried binding pocket observed in most G-protein-coupled receptors published so far, the morphinan ligand binds deeply within a large solvent-exposed pocket. Of particular interest, the mu-OR crystallizes as a two-fold symmetrical dimer through a four-helix bundle motif formed by transmembrane segments 5 and 6.

27,74,94.0,"Stresses acting on cold, thick and negatively buoyant oceanic lithosphere are thought to be crucial to the initiation of subduction and the operation of plate tectonics(1,2), which characterizes the present-day geodynamics of the Earth. Because the Earth's interior was hotter in the Archaean eon, the oceanic crust may have been thicker, thereby making the oceanic lithosphere more buoyant than at present(3), and whether subduction and plate tectonics occurred during this time is ambiguous, both in the geological record and in geodynamic models(4). Here we show that because the oceanic crust was thick and buoyant(5), early continents may have produced intra-lithospheric gravitational stresses large enough to drive their gravitational spreading, to initiate subduction at their margins and to trigger episodes of subduction. Our model predicts the co-occurrence of deep to progressively shallower mafic volcanics and arc magmatism within continents in a self-consistent geodynamic framework, explaining the enigmatic multimodal volcanism and tectonic record of Archaean cratons(6). Moreover, our model predicts a petrological stratification and tectonic structure of the sub-continental lithospheric mantle, two predictions that are consistent with xenolith(5) and seismic studies, respectively, and consistent with the existence of amid-lithospheric seismic discontinuity(7). The slow gravitational collapse of early continents could have kick-started transient episodes of plate tectonics until, as the Earth's interior cooled and oceanic lithosphere became heavier, plate tectonics became self-sustaining.","Rey, Patrice F.; Coltice, Nicolas; Flament, Nicolas","Rey, PF; Coltice, N; Flament, N",405.0,"[Rey, Patrice F.; Flament, Nicolas] Univ Sydney, Earthbyte Res Grp, Sch Geosci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Coltice, Nicolas] Univ Lyon 1, Ecole Normale Super Lyon, UMR CNRS 5276, Lab Geol Lyon, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France; [Coltice, Nicolas] Inst Univ France, F-75005 Paris, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13728,Article,1476-4687,patrice.rey@sydney.edu.au,+,Australian Government; Institut Universitaire de France; European Research Council (ERC) [617588]; Statoil ASA,"We thank W.

28,5,65.0,"Eukaryotic cells express a wide variety of endogenous small regulatory RNAs that regulate heterochromatin formation, developmental timing, defence against parasitic nucleic acids and genome rearrangement. Many small regulatory RNAs are thought to function in nuclei(1,2). For instance, in plants and fungi, short interfering RNA (siRNAs) associate with nascent transcripts and direct chromatin and/or DNA modifications(1,2). To understand further the biological roles of small regulatory RNAs, we conducted a genetic screen to identify factors required for RNA interference (RNAi) in Caenorhabditis elegans nuclei(3). Here we show that the gene nuclear RNAi defective-2 (nrde-2) encodes an evolutionarily conserved protein that is required for siRNA-mediated silencing in nuclei. NRDE-2 associates with the Argonaute protein NRDE-3 within nuclei and is recruited by NRDE-3/siRNA complexes to nascent transcripts that have been targeted by RNAi. We find that nuclear-localized siRNAs direct an NRDE-2-dependent silencing of pre-messenger RNAs (pre-mRNAs) 3' to sites of RNAi, an NRDE-2-dependent accumulation of RNA polymerase (RNAP) II at genomic loci targeted by RNAi, and NRDE-2-dependent decreases in RNAP II occupancy and RNAP II transcriptional activity 39 to sites of RNAi. These results define NRDE-2 as a component of the nuclear RNAi machinery and demonstrate that metazoan siRNAs can silence nuclear-localized RNAs co-transcriptionally. In addition, these results establish a novel mode of RNAP II regulation: siRNA-directed recruitment of NRDE factors that inhibit RNAP II during the elongation phase of transcription.","Guang, Shouhong; Bochner, Aaron F.; Burkhart, Kirk B.; Burton, Nick; Pavelec, Derek M.; Kennedy, Scott","Guang, SH; Bochner, AF; Burkhart, KB; Burton, N; Pavelec, DM; Kennedy, S",1097.0,"[Guang, Shouhong; Bochner, Aaron F.; Burkhart, Kirk B.; Burton, Nick; Kennedy, Scott] Univ Wisconsin, Genet Lab, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Pavelec, Derek M.; Kennedy, Scott] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Pharmacol, Madison, WI 53706 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09095,Article,,sgkennedy@wisc.edu,U165,Pew and Shaw scholars programmes; National Institutes of Health; American Heart Association,"We thank P.

29,76,149.0,"The transcriptome is the readout of the genome. Identifying common features in it across distant species can reveal fundamental principles. To this end, the ENCODE and modENCODE consortia have generated large amounts of matched RNA-sequencing data for human, worm and fly. Uniform processing and comprehensive annotation of these data allow comparison across metazoan phyla, extending beyond earlier within-phylum transcriptome comparisons and revealing ancient, conserved features(1-6). Specifically, we discover co-expression modules shared across animals, many of which are enriched in developmental genes. Moreover, we use expression patterns to align the stages in worm and fly development and find a novel pairing between worm embryo and fly pupae, in addition to the embryo-to-embryo and larvae-to-larvae pairings. Furthermore, we find that the extent of non-canonical, non-coding transcription is similar in each organism, per base pair. Finally, we find in all three organisms that the gene-expression levels, both coding and non-coding, can be quantitatively predicted from chromatin features at the promoter using a 'universal model' based on a single set of organism-independent parameters.","Gerstein, Mark B.; Rozowsky, Joel; Yan, Koon-Kiu; Wang, Daifeng; Cheng, Chao; Brown, James B.; Davis, Carrie A.; Hillier, LaDeana; Sisu, Cristina; Li, Jingyi Jessica; Pei, Baikang; Harmanci, Arif O.; Duff, Michael O.; Djebali, Sarah; Alexander, Roger P.; Alver, Burak H.; Auerbach, Raymond; Bell, Kimberly; Bickel, Peter J.; Boeck, Max E.; Boley, Nathan P.; Booth, Benjamin W.; Cherbas, Lucy; Cherbas, Peter; Di, Chao; Dobins, Alex; Drenkows, Jorg; Ewing, Brent; Fang, Gang; Fastucas, Megan; Feingold, Elise A.; Frankish, Adam; Gao, Guanjun; Good, Peter J.; Guigo, Roderic; Hammonds, Ann; Harrow, Jen; Hoskins, Roger A.; Howald, Cedric; Hu, Long; Huang, Haiyan; Hubbard, Tim J.

30,131,212.0,"The location and timing of cellular differentiation must be stringently controlled for proper organ formation. Normally, hepatocytes differentiate from hepatic progenitor cells to form the liver during development(1,2). However, previous studies have shown that the hepatic program can also be activated in non-hepatic lineage cells after exposure to particular stimuli or fusion with hepatocytes(3-9). These unexpected findings suggest that factors critical to hepatocyte differentiation exist and become activated to induce hepatocyte-specific properties in different cell types. Here, by screening the effects of twelve candidate factors, we identify three specific combinations of two transcription factors, comprising Hnf4 alpha plus Foxa1, Foxa2 or Foxa3, that can convert mouse embryonic and adult fibroblasts into cells that closely resemble hepatocytes in vitro. The induced hepatocyte-like (iHep) cells have multiple hepatocyte-specific features and reconstitute damaged hepatic tissues after transplantation. The generation of iHep cells may provide insights into the molecular nature of hepatocyte differentiation and potential therapies for liver diseases.","Sekiya, Sayaka; Suzuki, Atsushi","Sekiya, S; Suzuki, A",390.0,"[Sekiya, Sayaka; Suzuki, Atsushi] Kyushu Univ, Div Organogenesis & Regenerat, Med Inst Bioregulat, Higashi Ku, Fukuoka 8128582, Japan; [Suzuki, Atsushi] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, Precursory Res Embryon Sci & Technol PRESTO, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10263,Article,,suzukicks@bioreg.kyushu-u.ac.jp,U148,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan; Japan Science and Technology Agency","We thank A.

31,142,259.0,"The proteasome is the major ATP-dependent protease in eukaryotic cells, but limited structural information restricts a mechanistic understanding of its activities. The proteasome regulatory particle, consisting of the lid and base subcomplexes, recognizes and processes polyubiquitinated substrates. Here we used electron microscopy and a new heterologous expression system for the lid to delineate the complete subunit architecture of the regulatory particle from yeast. Our studies reveal the spatial arrangement of ubiquitin receptors, deubiquitinating enzymes and the protein unfolding machinery at subnanometre resolution, outlining the substrate's path to degradation. Unexpectedly, the ATPase subunits within the base unfoldase are arranged in a spiral staircase, providing insight into potential mechanisms for substrate translocation through the central pore. Large conformational rearrangements of the lid upon holoenzyme formation suggest allosteric regulation of deubiquitination.

32,151,68.0,"Electrons in a metal are indistinguishable particles that interact strongly with other electrons and their environment. Isolating and detecting a single flying electron after propagation, in a similar manner to quantum optics experiments with single photons(1,2), is therefore a challenging task. So far only a few experiments have been performed in a high-mobility two-dimensional electron gas in which the electron propagates almost ballistically(3-5). In these previous works, flying electrons were detected by means of the current generated by an ensemble of electrons, and electron correlations were encrypted in the current noise. Here we demonstrate the experimental realization of high-efficiency single-electron source and detector for a single electron propagating isolated from the other electrons through a one-dimensional channel. The moving potential is excited by a surface acoustic wave, which carries the single electron along the one-dimensional channel at a speed of 3 mu m ns(-1). When this quantum channel is placed between two quantum dots several micrometres apart, a single electron can be transported from one quantum dot to the other with quantum efficiencies of emission and detection of 96% and 92%, respectively. Furthermore, the transfer of the electron can be triggered on a timescale shorter than the coherence time T-2* of GaAs spin qubits(6). Our work opens new avenues with which to study the teleportation of a single electron spin and the distant interaction between spatially separated qubits in a condensed-matter system.","Hermelin, Sylvain; Takada, Shintaro; Yamamoto, Michihisa; Tarucha, Seigo; Wieck, Andreas D.; Saminadayar, Laurent; Baeuerle, Christopher; Meunier, Tristan","Hermelin, S; Takada, S; Yamamoto, M; Tarucha, S; Wieck, AD; Saminadayar, L; Bauerle, C; Meunier, T",435.0,"[Hermelin, Sylvain; Saminadayar, Laurent; Baeuerle, Christopher; Meunier, Tristan] CNRS, Inst Neel, F-38042 Grenoble, France; [Hermelin, Sylvain; Saminadayar, Laurent; Baeuerle, Christopher; Meunier, Tristan] Univ Grenoble 1, F-38042 Grenoble, France; [Takada, Shintaro; Yamamoto, Michihisa; Tarucha, Seigo] Univ Tokyo, Dept Appl Phys, Tokyo 1138656, Japan; [Yamamoto, Michihisa] ERATO JST, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3310012, Japan; [Tarucha, Seigo] ICORP Int Cooperat Res Project Quantum Spin Infor, Atsugi, Kanagawa 2430198, Japan; [Wieck, Andreas D.] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Lehrstuhl Angew Festkorperphys, D-44780 Bochum, Germany; [Saminadayar, Laurent] Inst Univ France, F-75005 Paris, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10416,Article,,bauerle@grenoble.cnrs.fr; tristan.meunier@grenoble.cnrs.fr,438,"ERATO-JST [080300000477]; Special Coordination Funds for Promoting Science and Technology (NanoQuine); Japan Science and Technology Agency Strategic International Cooperative Program; Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology; Harvard University; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SPP1285]; Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung [QuaHLRep 01BQ1035]; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (DREI) - Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [PRC 424, L08519]; Marie-Curie European Reintegration Grant [224786]; Nanoscience Foundation of Grenoble;  [20684011]","We thank Y.

33,101,26.0,"The NRT1/PTR family of proton-coupled transporters are responsible for nitrogen assimilation in eukaryotes and bacteria through the uptake of peptides. However, in most plant species members of this family have evolved to transport nitrate as well as additional secondary metabolites and hormones. In response to falling nitrate levels, NRT1.1 is phosphorylated on an intracellular threonine that switches the transporter from a low-affinity to high-affinity state. Here we present both the apo and nitrate-bound crystal structures of Arabidopsis thaliana NRT1.1, which together with in vitro binding and transport data identify a key role for His 356 in nitrate binding. Our data support a model whereby phosphorylation increases structural flexibility and in turn the rate of transport. Comparison with peptide transporters further reveal show the NRT1/PTR family has evolved to recognize diverse nitrogenous ligands, while maintaining elements of a conserved coupling mechanism within this superfamily of nutrient transporters.","Parker, Joanne L.; Newstead, Simon","Parker, JL; Newstead, S",68.0,"[Parker, Joanne L.; Newstead, Simon] Univ Oxford, Dept Biochem, Oxford OX1 3QU, England; [Newstead, Simon] Rutherford Appleton Lab, Didcot OX11 0FA, Oxon, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13116,Article,1476-4687,joanne.parker@bioch.ox.ac.uk; simon.newstead@bioch.ox.ac.uk,+,"Medical Research Council (MRC) [G0900399]; Royal Society [RG110211, IE111401]","We thank R.

34,45,312.0,"Radioactive decay of uranium and thorium produces He-4, whereas He-3 in the Earth's mantle is not produced by radioactive decay and was only incorporated during accretion-that is, it is primordial(1). He-3/He-4 ratios in many ocean-island basalts (OIBs) that erupt at hotspot volcanoes, such as Hawaii and Iceland, can be up to sixfold higher than in mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORBs). This is inferred to be the result of outgassing by melt production at mid-ocean ridges in conjunction with radiogenic ingrowth of He-4, which has led to a volatile-depleted upper mantle (MORB source) with low He-3 concentrations and low He-3/He-4 ratios(2-6). Consequently, high He-3/He-4 ratios in OIBs are conventionally viewed as evidence for an undegassed, primitive mantle source, which is sampled by hot, buoyantly upwelling deep-mantle plumes(3,6,7). However, this conventional model provides no viable explanation of why helium concentrations and elemental ratios of He/Ne and He/Ar in OIBs are an order of magnitude lower than in MORBs. This has been described as the 'helium concentration paradox'(8) and has contributed to a long-standing controversy about the structure and dynamics of the Earth's mantle. Here we show that the helium concentration paradox, as well as the full range of noble-gas concentrations observed in MORB and OIB glasses, can self-consistently be explained by disequilibrium open-system degassing of the erupting magma. We show that a higher CO2 content in OIBs than in MORBs leads to more extensive degassing of helium in OIB magmas and that noble gases in OIB lavas can be derived from a largely undegassed primitive mantle source.","Gonnermann, Helge M.; Mukhopadhyay, Sujoy","Gonnermann, HM; Mukhopadhyay, S",1037.0,"Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06240,Article,,helge@hawaii.edu,1040,,,223TK,,,RARE-GAS SYSTEMATICS; MIDOCEAN RIDGE; UPPER-MANTLE; LOIHI SEAMOUNT; EARTHS MANTLE; POPPING ROCK; NOBLE-GASES; BASALTS; GEOCHEMISTRY; CONSTRAINTS,7165.0,NATURE,Nature,English,33.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",25-Oct,4.0,LONDON,17960241.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007.0,"Gonnermann, Helge/B-1054-2012","Gonnermann, HM (reprint author), Univ Hawaii, SOEST, Dept Geol & Geophys, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,38.0,Non-equilibrium degassing and a primordial source for helium in ocean-island volcanism,1.0,19.0,WOS:000250395000049,312.0,449,Multidisciplinary Sciences,39,sujoy,mukhopadhyay,2363.0,8,male,1.0,MXCTBcwAAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
35,73,353.0,"West Africa is currently witnessing the most extensive Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak so far recorded(1-3). Until now, there have been 27,013 reported cases and 11,134 deaths. The origin of the virus is thought to have been a zoonotic transmission from a bat to a two-year-old boy in December 2013 (ref. 2). From this index case the virus was spread by human-to-human contact throughout Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. However, the origin of the particular virus in each country and time of transmission is not known and currently relies on epidemiological analysis, which may be unreliable owing to the difficulties of obtaining patient information. Here we trace the genetic evolution of EBOV in the current outbreak that has resulted in multiple lineages. Deep sequencing of 179 patient samples processed by the European Mobile Laboratory, the first diagnostics unit to be deployed to the epicentre of the outbreak in Guinea, reveals an epidemiological and evolutionary history of the epidemic from March 2014 to January 2015. Analysis of EBOV genome evolution has also benefited from a similar sequencing effort of patient samples from Sierra Leone. Our results confirm that the EBOV from Guinea moved into Sierra Leone, most likely in April or early May. The viruses of the Guinea/Sierra Leone lineage mixed around June/July 2014. Viral sequences covering August, September and October 2014 indicate that this lineage evolved independently within Guinea. These data can be used in conjunction with epidemiological information to test retrospectively the effectiveness of control measures, and provides an unprecedented window into the evolution of an ongoing viral haemorrhagic fever outbreak.","Carroll, Miles W.; Matthews, David A.; Hiscox, Julian A.; Elmore, Michael J.; Pollakis, Georgios; Rambaut, Andrew; Hewson, Roger; Garcia-Dorival, Isabel; Bore, Joseph Akoi; Koundouno, Raymond; Abdellati, Said; Afrough, Babak; Aiyepada, John; Akhilomen, Patience; Asogun, Danny; Atkinson, Barry; Badusche, Marlis; Bah, Amadou; Bate, Simon; Baumann, Jan; Becker, Dirk; Becker-Ziaja, Beate; Bocquin, Anne; Borremans, Benny; Bosworth, Andrew; Boettcher, Jan Peter; Cannas, Angela; Carletti, Fabrizio; Castilletti, Concetta; Clark, Simon; Colavita, Francesca; Diederich, Sandra; Donatus, Adomeh; Duraffour, Sophie; Ehichioya, Deborah; Ellerbrok, Heinz; Fernandez-Garcia, Maria Dolores; Fizet, Alexandra; Fleischmann, Erna; Gryseels, Sophie; Hermelink, Antje; Hinzmann, Julia; Hopf-Guevara, Ute; Ighodalo, Yemisi; Jameson, Lisa; Kelterbaum, Anne; Kis, Zoltan; Kloth, Stefan; Kohl, Claudia; Korva, Misa; Kraus, Annette; Kuisma, Eeva; Kurth, Andreas; Liedigk, Britta; Logue, Christopher H.; Luedtke, Anja; Maes, Piet; McCowen, James; Mely, Stephane; Mertens, Marc; Meschi, Silvia; Meyer, Benjamin; Michel, Janine; Molkenthin, Peter; Munoz-Fontela, Cesar; Muth, Doreen; Newman, Edmund N.

36,156,239.0,"Heat generation by electric current, which is ubiquitous in electronic devices and circuits, raises energy consumption and will become increasingly problematic in future generations of high-density electronics. The control and re-use of heat are therefore important topics for existing and emerging technologies, including spintronics. Recently it was reported that heat flow within a ferromagnet can produce a flow of spin angular momentum-a spin current-and an associated voltage(1). This spin Seebeck effect has been observed in metallic(1,2), insulating(3) and semiconductor ferromagnets(4) with temperature gradients across them. Here we describe and report the demonstration of Seebeck spin tunnelling-a distinctly different thermal spin flow, of purely interfacial nature-generated in a tunnel contact between electrodes of different temperatures when at least one of the electrodes is a ferromagnet. The Seebeck spin current is governed by the energy derivative of the tunnel spin polarization. By exploiting this in ferromagnet-oxide-silicon tunnel junctions, we observe thermal transfer of spins from the ferromagnet to the silicon without a net tunnel charge current. The induced spin accumulation scales linearly with heating power and changes sign when the temperature differential is reversed. This thermal spin current can be used by itself, or in combination with electrical spin injection, to increase device efficiency. The results highlight the engineering of heat transport in spintronic devices and facilitate the functional use of heat.","Le Breton, Jean-Christophe; Sharma, Sandeep; Saito, Hidekazu; Yuasa, Shinji; Jansen, Ron","Le Breton, JC; Sharma, S; Saito, H; Yuasa, S; Jansen, R",82.0,"[Sharma, Sandeep; Saito, Hidekazu; Yuasa, Shinji; Jansen, Ron] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Spintron Res Ctr, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058568, Japan; [Le Breton, Jean-Christophe; Sharma, Sandeep] Netherlands Fdn Fundamental Res Matter FOM, NL-3502 GA Utrecht, Netherlands; [Sharma, Sandeep] Univ Groningen, Zernike Inst Adv Mat, NL-9747 AG Groningen, Netherlands",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10224,Article,1476-4687,ron.jansen@aist.go.jp,85,Netherlands Foundation for Fundamental Research on Matter (FOM),"We are grateful to S.

37,92,291.0,"Quantum computers promise dramatic advantages over their classical counterparts, but the source of the power in quantum computing has remained elusive. Here we prove a remarkable equivalence between the onset of contextuality and the possibility of universal quantum computation via 'magic state' distillation, which is the leading model for experimentally realizing a fault-tolerant quantum computer. This is a conceptually satisfying link, because contextuality, which precludes a simple 'hidden variable' model of quantum mechanics, provides one of the fundamental characterizations of uniquely quantum phenomena. Furthermore, this connection suggests a unifying paradigm for the resources of quantum information: the non-locality of quantum theory is a particular kind of contextuality, and non-locality is already known to be a critical resource for achieving advantages with quantum communication. In addition to clarifying these fundamental issues, this work advances the resource framework for quantum computation, which has a number of practical applications, such as characterizing the efficiency and trade-offs between distinct theoretical and experimental schemes for achieving robust quantum computation, and putting bounds on the overhead cost for the classical simulation of quantum algorithms.","Howard, Mark; Wallman, Joel; Veitch, Victor; Emerson, Joseph","Howard, M; Wallman, J; Veitch, V; Emerson, J",351.0,"[Howard, Mark] Natl Univ Ireland, Dept Math Phys, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland; [Howard, Mark; Wallman, Joel; Veitch, Victor; Emerson, Joseph] Univ Waterloo, Inst Quantum Comp, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Howard, Mark; Wallman, Joel; Veitch, Victor; Emerson, Joseph] Univ Waterloo, Dept Appl Math, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Veitch, Victor] Univ Toronto, Dept Stat, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13460,Article,1476-4687,jemerson@math.uwaterloo.ca,355,Irish Research Council (IRC) as part of the Empower Fellowship programme; CIFAR; Government of Canada through NSERC,"M.H. was supported by the Irish Research Council (IRC) as part of the Empower Fellowship programme, and all authors acknowledge support from CIFAR and the Government of Canada through NSERC.",AJ0NG,Y,N,HIDDEN-VARIABLES; MECHANICS; COMPUTER,7505.0,NATURE,Nature,English,48.0,No,"Wallman, Joel/0000-0001-6943-5334; Howard, Mark/0000-0002-6910-185X","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",19-Jun,5.0,LONDON,24919152.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2014.0,,"Emerson, J (reprint author), Univ Waterloo, Inst Quantum Comp, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,88.0,Contextuality supplies the 'magic' for quantum computation,4.0,44.0,WOS:000337350200026,291.0,510,Multidisciplinary Sciences,89,joseph,emerson,4124.0,2213,male,0.99,n8S2KokAAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",46463476,1,26202,1,Joseph Emerson,Joseph Emerson,1,1

Massively parallel cDNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has been revolutionizing global transcriptomic analysis. Here, using a novel differential approach (dRNA-seq) selective for the 5' end of primary transcripts, we present a genome-wide map of H. pylori transcriptional start sites and operons. We discovered hundreds of transcriptional start sites within operons, and opposite to annotated genes, indicating that complexity of gene expression from the small H. pylori genome is increased by uncoupling of polycistrons and by genome-wide antisense transcription. We also discovered an unexpected number of similar to 60 small RNAs including the e-subdivision counterpart of the regulatory 6S RNA and associated RNA products, and potential regulators of cis- and trans-encoded target messenger RNAs. Our approach establishes a paradigm for mapping and annotating the primary transcriptomes of many living species.","Sharma, Cynthia M.; Hoffmann, Steve; Darfeuille, Fabien; Reignier, Jeremy; Findeiss, Sven; Sittka, Alexandra; Chabas, Sandrine; Reiche, Kristin; Hackermueller, Joerg; Reinhardt, Richard; Stadler, Peter F.; Vogel, Joerg","Sharma, CM; Hoffmann, S; Darfeuille, F; Reignier, J; Findeiss, S; Sittka, A; Chabas, S; Reiche, K; Hackermuller, J; Reinhardt, R; Stadler, PF; Vogel, J",250.0,"[Sharma, Cynthia M.; Sittka, Alexandra; Vogel, Joerg] Max Planck Inst Infect Biol, RNA Biol Grp, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Hoffmann, Steve; Findeiss, Sven; Stadler, Peter F.] Univ Leipzig, Dept Comp Sci, D-04107 Leipzig, Germany; [Hoffmann, Steve; Findeiss, Sven; Stadler, Peter F.] Univ Leipzig, Interdisciplinary Ctr Bioinformat, D-04107 Leipzig, Germany; [Darfeuille, Fabien; Reignier, Jeremy; Chabas, Sandrine] INSERM, U869, F-33076 Bordeaux, France; [Darfeuille, Fabien; Reignier, Jeremy; Chabas, Sandrine] Univ Bordeaux, F-33076 Bordeaux, France; [Reiche, Kristin; Hackermueller, Joerg; Stadler, Peter F.] Fraunhofer Inst Cell Therapy & Immunol, RNom Grp, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Reinhardt, Richard] Max Planck Inst Mol Genet, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Stadler, Peter F.] Max Planck Inst Math Sci, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Stadler, Peter F.] Univ Vienna, Inst Theoret Chem, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Stadler, Peter F.] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA; [Vogel, Joerg] Univ Wurzburg, Inst Mol Infect Biol, D-97080 Wurzburg, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08756,Article,,joerg.vogel@uni-wuerzburg.de,255,"NGFN, BMBF, Germany; DFG [SPP1258]; Regulatory RNAs in Prokaryotes [VO8751/2, VO8751/4, STA850/7-1]; University of Leipzig; Freistaat Sachsen; German Research Foundation IZBI [BIZ6/1-4]; Volkswagen Stiftung [I/82 720]; French Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-07-JCJC-0104-01]; French Association de la Recherche contre le Cancer (ARC); La Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer (LNCC)","We thank F.

40,119,154.0,"Human language, as well as birdsong, relies on the ability to arrange vocal elements in new sequences. However, little is known about the ontogenetic origin of this capacity. Here we track the development of vocal combinatorial capacity in three species of vocal learners, combining an experimental approach in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) with an analysis of natural development of vocal transitions in Bengalese finches (Lonchura striata domestica) and pre-lingual human infants. We find a common, stepwise pattern of acquiring vocal transitions across species. In our first study, juvenile zebra finches were trained to perform one song and then the training target was altered, prompting the birds to swap syllable order, or insert a new syllable into a string. All birds solved these permutation tasks in a series of steps, gradually approximating the target sequence by acquiring new pairwise syllable transitions, sometimes too slowly to accomplish the task fully. Similarly, in the more complex songs of Bengalese finches, branching points and bidirectional transitions in song syntax were acquired in a stepwise fashion, starting from a more restrictive set of vocal transitions. The babbling of pre-lingual human infants showed a similar pattern: instead of a single developmental shift from reduplicated to variegated babbling (that is, from repetitive to diverse sequences), we observed multiple shifts, where each new syllable type slowly acquired a diversity of pairwise transitions, asynchronously over development. Collectively, these results point to a common generative process that is conserved across species, suggesting that the long-noted gap between perceptual versus motor combinatorial capabilities in human infants(1) may arise partly from the challenges in constructing new pairwise vocal transitions.","Lipkind, Dina; Marcus, Gary F.; Bemis, Douglas K.; Sasahara, Kazutoshi; Jacoby, Nori; Takahasi, Miki; Suzuki, Kenta; Feher, Olga; Ravbar, Primoz; Okanoya, Kazuo; Tchernichovski, Ofer","Lipkind, D; Marcus, GF; Bemis, DK; Sasahara, K; Jacoby, N; Takahasi, M; Suzuki, K; Feher, O; Ravbar, P; Okanoya, K; Tchernichovski, O",104.0,"[Lipkind, Dina; Feher, Olga; Tchernichovski, Ofer] CUNY Hunter Coll, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Lipkind, Dina; Feher, Olga; Ravbar, Primoz; Tchernichovski, Ofer] CUNY City Coll, Dept Biol, New York, NY 10031 USA; [Marcus, Gary F.; Bemis, Douglas K.] NYU, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Sasahara, Kazutoshi; Takahasi, Miki; Suzuki, Kenta; Okanoya, Kazuo] RIKEN Brain Sci Inst, Lab Biolinguist, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Jacoby, Nori] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Interdisciplinary Ctr Neural Computat, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel; [Jacoby, Nori] Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Mus, IL-5290002 Ramat Gan, Israel; [Suzuki, Kenta; Okanoya, Kazuo] JST ERATO Okanoya Emot Informat Project, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Feher, Olga; Ravbar, Primoz; Tchernichovski, Ofer] CUNY, Grad Ctr, New York, NY 10016 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12173,Article,,dina.lipkind@gmail.com,+,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan; US Public Health Service grant","We thank J.

41,66,169.0,"Over a century of research into the origin of turbulence in wall-bounded shear flows has resulted in a puzzling picture in which turbulence appears in a variety of different states competing with laminar background flow(1-6). At moderate flow speeds, turbulence is confined to localized patches; it is only at higher speeds that the entire flow becomes turbulent. The origin of the different states encountered during this transition, the front dynamics of the turbulent regions and the transformation to full turbulence have yet to be explained. By combining experiments, theory and computer simulations, here we uncover a bifurcation scenario that explains the transformation to fully turbulent pipe flow and describe the front dynamics of the different states encountered in the process. Key to resolving this problem is the interpretation of the flow as a bistable system with nonlinear propagation (advection) of turbulent fronts.

42,141,204.0,"The biogeochemical cycles of iron and organic carbon are strongly interlinked. In oceanic waters, organic ligands have been shown to control the concentration of dissolved iron(1). In soils, solid iron phases shelter and preserve organic carbon(2), but the role of iron in the preservation of organic matter in sediments has not been clearly established. Here we use an iron reduction method previously applied to soils(3) to determine the amount of organic carbon associated with reactive iron phases in sediments of various mineralogies collected from a wide range of depositional environments. Our findings suggest that 21.5 +/- 8.6 per cent of the organic carbon in sediments is directly bound to reactive iron phases. We further estimate that a global mass of (19-45) x 10(15) grams of organic carbon is preserved in surface marine sediments as a result of its association with iron(4). We propose that these associations between organic carbon and iron, which are formed primarily through co-precipitation and/or direct chelation, promote the preservation of organic carbon in sediments. Because reactive iron phases are metastable over geological timescales, we suggest that they serve as an efficient 'rusty sink' for organic carbon, acting as a key factor in the long-term storage of organic carbon and thus contributing to the global cycles of carbon, oxygen and sulphur(5).","Lalonde, Karine; Mucci, Alfonso; Ouellet, Alexandre; Gelinas, Yves","Lalonde, K; Mucci, A; Ouellet, A; Gelinas, Y",198.0,"[Lalonde, Karine; Ouellet, Alexandre; Gelinas, Yves] Concordia Univ, GEOTOP, Montreal, PQ H4B 1R6, Canada; [Lalonde, Karine; Ouellet, Alexandre; Gelinas, Yves] Concordia Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem, Montreal, PQ H4B 1R6, Canada; [Mucci, Alfonso] McGill Univ, GEOTOP, Montreal, PQ H3A 2A7, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10855,Article,,ygelinas@alcor.concordia.ca,200,NSERC; CFI; FQRNT,"This work is dedicated to the memory of J.I.

43,67,182.0,"The altered activity of the fructose transporter GLUT5, an isoform of the facilitated-diffusion glucose transporter family, has been linked to disorders such as type 2 diabetes and obesity. GLUT5 is also overexpressed in certain tumour cells, and inhibitors are potential drugs for these conditions. Here we describe the crystal structures of GLUT5 from Rattus norvegicus and Bos taurus in open outward-and open inward-facing conformations, respectively. GLUT5 has a major facilitator superfamily fold like other homologous monosaccharide transporters. On the basis of a comparison of the inward-facing structures of GLUT5 and human GLUT1, a ubiquitous glucose transporter, we show that a single point mutation is enough to switch the substrate-binding preference of GLUT5 from fructose to glucose. A comparison of the substrate-free structures of GLUT5 with occluded substrate-bound structures of Escherichia coli XylE suggests that, in addition to global rocker-switch-like re-orientation of the bundles, local asymmetric rearrangements of carboxy-terminal transmembrane bundle helices TM7 and TM10 underlie a 'gated-pore' transport mechanism in such monosaccharide transporters.","Nomura, Norimichi; Verdon, Gregory; Kang, Hae Joo; Shimamura, Tatsuro; Nomura, Yayoi; Sonoda, Yo; Hussien, Saba Abdul; Qureshi, Aziz Abdul; Coincon, Mathieu; Sato, Yumi; Abe, Hitomi; Nakada-Nakura, Yoshiko; Hino, Tomoya; Arakawa, Takatoshi; Kusano-Arai, Osamu; Iwanari, Hiroko; Murata, Takeshi; Kobayashi, Takuya; Hamakubo, Takao; Kasahara, Michihiro; Iwata, So; Drew, David","Nomura, N; Verdon, G; Kang, HJ; Shimamura, T; Nomura, Y; Sonoda, Y; Hussien, SA; Qureshi, AA; Coincon, M; Sato, Y; Abe, H; Nakada-Nakura, Y; Hino, T; Arakawa, T; Kusano-Arai, O; Iwanari, H; Murata, T; Kobayashi, T; Hamakubo, T; Kasahara, M; Iwata, S; Drew, D",397.0,"[Nomura, Norimichi; Shimamura, Tatsuro; Nomura, Yayoi; Sato, Yumi; Abe, Hitomi; Nakada-Nakura, Yoshiko; Hino, Tomoya; Arakawa, Takatoshi; Murata, Takeshi; Kobayashi, Takuya; Iwata, So] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Nomura, Norimichi; Shimamura, Tatsuro; Nomura, Yayoi; Hino, Tomoya; Arakawa, Takatoshi; Murata, Takeshi; Kobayashi, Takuya; Iwata, So] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, ERATO, Iwata Human Receptor Crystallog Project, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Nomura, Norimichi; Shimamura, Tatsuro; Nomura, Yayoi; Nakada-Nakura, Yoshiko; Murata, Takeshi; Kobayashi, Takuya; Iwata, So] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, Res Accelerat Program, Membrane Prot Crystallog Project, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Verdon, Gregory; Kang, Hae Joo; Sonoda, Yo; Iwata, So; Drew, David] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Div Mol Biosci, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Verdon, Gregory; Kang, Hae Joo; Iwata, So] Diamond Light Source, Membrane Prot Lab, Chilton OX11 0DE, Oxon, England; [Verdon, Gregory; Kang, Hae Joo; Iwata, So] Rutherford Appleton Lab, Res Complex Harwell, Didcot OX11 0FA, Oxon, England; [Hussien, Saba Abdul; Qureshi, Aziz Abdul; Coincon, Mathieu; Drew, David] Stockholm Univ, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Ctr Biomembrane Res, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Kusano-Arai, Osamu; Hamakubo, Takao] Univ Tokyo, Dept Quantitat Biol & Med, Res Ctr Adv Sci & Technol, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1538904, Japan; [Murata, Takeshi; Iwata, So] RIKEN, Syst & Struct Biol Ctr, Tsurumi Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Kasahara, Michihiro] Teikyo Univ, Sch Med, Biophys Lab, Hachioji, Tokyo 1920395, Japan",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14909,Article,1476-4687,nnomura@mfour.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp; s.iwata@mfour.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp; ddrew@dbb.su.se,+,"Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation; Royal Society; BBSRC [BB/G02325/1]; ERATO Human Receptor Crystallography Project of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST); Research Acceleration Program of the JST; Targeted Proteins Research Program of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan; MEXT [22570114]; MEXT; Wellcome Trust at the Diamond Light Source Limited [062164/Z/00/Z]; Centre for Biomembrane Research (CBR) - Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research; Human Frontiers Postdoctoral fellowship; EMBO through Young Investigator Program (YIP)","We are grateful to D.

44,149,445.0,"Flying insects oscillate their wings at high frequencies of up to 1,000 Hz(1,2) and produce large mechanical forces of 80 W per kilogram of muscle(3). They utilize a pair of perpendicularly oriented indirect flight muscles that contain fibrillar, stretch-activated myofibres. In contrast, all other, more slowly contracting, insect body muscles have a tubular muscle morphology(4). Here we identify the transcription factor Spalt major (Salm) as a master regulator of fibrillar flight muscle fate in Drosophila. salm is necessary and sufficient to induce fibrillar muscle fate. salm switches the entire transcriptional program from tubular to fibrillar fate by regulating the expression and splicing of key sarcomeric components specific to each muscle type. Spalt function is conserved in insects evolutionarily separated by 280 million years. We propose that Spalt proteins switch myofibres from tubular to fibrillar fate during development, a function potentially conserved in the vertebrate heart-a stretch-activated muscle sharing features with insect flight muscle.","Schoenbauer, Cornelia; Distler, Jutta; Jaehrling, Nina; Radolf, Martin; Dodt, Hans-Ulrich; Frasch, Manfred; Schnorrer, Frank","Schonbauer, C; Distler, J; Jahrling, N; Radolf, M; Dodt, HU; Frasch, M; Schnorrer, F",406.0,"[Schoenbauer, Cornelia; Schnorrer, Frank] Max Planck Inst Biochem, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany; [Distler, Jutta; Frasch, Manfred] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Dept Biol, Dev Biol Div, D-91058 Erlangen, Germany; [Jaehrling, Nina; Dodt, Hans-Ulrich] Vienna Univ Technol, FKE, Dept Bioelect, A-1040 Vienna, Austria; [Jaehrling, Nina; Dodt, Hans-Ulrich] Med Univ Vienna, Ctr Brain Res, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Radolf, Martin] IMP, A-1030 Vienna, Austria",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10559,Article,,schnorrer@biochem.mpg.de,U160,Max-Planck-Society; Human Frontier Science Programme; Austrian Academy of Sciences; DFG,"We thank M.

46,154,179.0,"About one-third of the carbon dioxide (CO(2)) released into the atmosphere as a result of human activity has been absorbed by the oceans(1), where it partitions into the constituent ions of carbonic acid. This leads to ocean acidification, one of the major threats to marine ecosystems(2) and particularly to calcifying organisms such as corals(3,4), foraminifera(5-7) and coccolithophores(8). Coccolithophores are abundant phytoplankton that are responsible for a large part of modern oceanic carbonate production. Culture experiments investigating the physiological response of coccolithophore calcification to increased CO(2) have yielded contradictory results between and even within species(8-11). Here we quantified the calcite mass of dominant coccolithophores in the present ocean and over the past forty thousand years, and found a marked pattern of decreasing calcification with increasing partial pressure of CO(2) and concomitant decreasing concentrations of CO(3)(2-). Our analyses revealed that differentially calcified species and morphotypes are distributed in the ocean according to carbonate chemistry. A substantial impact on the marine carbon cycle might be expected upon extrapolation of this correlation to predicted ocean acidification in the future. However, our discovery of a heavily calcified Emiliania huxleyi morphotype in modern waters with low pH highlights the complexity of assemblage-level responses to environmental forcing factors.","Beaufort, L.; Probert, I.; de Garidel-Thoron, T.; Bendif, E.

48,1,0.0,"The El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) system during the Pliocene warm period (PWP; 3-5 million years ago) may have existed in a permanent El Nino state with a sharply reduced zonal sea surface temperature (SST) gradient in the equatorial Pacific Ocean(1). This suggests that during the PWP, when global mean temperatures and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations were similar to those projected for near-term climate change(2), ENSO variability-and related global climate teleconnections-could have been radically different from that today. Yet, owing to a lack of observational evidence on seasonal and interannual SST variability from crucial low-latitude sites, this fundamental climate characteristic of the PWP remains controversial(1,3-10). Here we show that permanent El Nino conditions did not exist during the PWP. Our spectral analysis of the delta(18)O SST and salinity proxy, extracted from two 35-year, monthly resolved PWP Porites corals in the Philippines, reveals variability that is similar to present ENSO variation. Although our fossil corals cannot be directly compared with modern ENSO records, two lines of evidence suggest that Philippine corals are appropriate ENSO proxies. First, delta(18)O anomalies from a nearby live Porites coral are correlated with modern records of ENSO variability. Second, negative-delta(18)O events in the fossil corals closely resemble the decreases in delta(18)O seen in the live coral during El Nino events. Prior research advocating a permanent El Nino state may have been limited by the coarse resolution of many SST proxies, whereas our coral-based analysis identifies climate variability at the temporal scale required to resolve ENSO structure firmly.","Watanabe, Tsuyoshi; Suzuki, Atsushi; Minobe, Shoshiro; Kawashima, Tatsunori; Kameo, Koji; Minoshima, Kayo; Aguilar, Yolanda M.; Wani, Ryoji; Kawahata, Hodaka; Sowa, Kohki; Nagai, Takaya; Kase, Tomoki","Watanabe, T; Suzuki, A; Minobe, S; Kawashima, T; Kameo, K; Minoshima, K; Aguilar, YM; Wani, R; Kawahata, H; Sowa, K; Nagai, T; Kase, T",209.0,"[Watanabe, Tsuyoshi; Minobe, Shoshiro; Kawashima, Tatsunori; Sowa, Kohki; Nagai, Takaya] Hokkaido Univ, Dept Nat Hist Sci, Fac Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan; [Suzuki, Atsushi; Minoshima, Kayo] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Geol Survey Japan, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058567, Japan; [Kameo, Koji] Chiba Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Fac Sci, Chiba 2638522, Japan; [Aguilar, Yolanda M.] Mines & Geosci Bur, Petrolab, Quezon City 1101, Philippines; [Wani, Ryoji] Yokohama Natl Univ, Interdisciplinary Res Ctr, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2408501, Japan; [Kawahata, Hodaka] Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, Kashiwa, Chiba 2775564, Japan; [Kase, Tomoki] Natl Museum Nat & Sci, Dept Geol & Paleontol, Tokyo 1690073, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09777,Article,,nabe@mail.sci.hokudai.ac.jp,211,,,732FK,,,SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; SOUTHERN-OSCILLATION; TROPICAL PACIFIC; CLIMATE; VARIABILITY; PRECIPITATION; PATTERNS; EPOCH,7337.0,NATURE,Nature,English,23.0,No,"Minobe, Shoshiro/0000-0002-9487-9006; KAWAHATA, HODAKA/0000-0003-4236-7356; Wani, Ryoji/0000-0002-3733-769X","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",10-Mar,3.0,LONDON,21390128.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2011.0,"Watanabe, Tsuyoshi/A-5741-2012; Minobe, Shoshiro/E-2997-2010; Nagai, Takaya/C-3428-2011; Minoshima, Kaoru/G-1435-2013; kohki, sowa/D-2955-2011; KAWAHATA, HODAKA/F-9065-2016","Watanabe, T (reprint author), Hokkaido Univ, Dept Nat Hist Sci, Fac Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,60.0,Permanent El Nino during the Pliocene warm period not supported by coral evidence,2.0,51.0,WOS:000288170200035,0.0,471,Multidisciplinary Sciences,62,tomoki,kase,1578.0,4,male,1.0,hWANX-AAAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
49,77,427.0,"The molecularly defined clade Ecdysozoa(1) comprises the panarthropods (Euarthropoda, Onychophora and Tardigrada) and the cycloneuralian worms (Nematoda, Nematomorpha, Priapulida, Loricifera and Kinorhyncha). These disparate phyla are united by their means of moulting, but otherwise share few morphological characters-none of which has a meaningful fossilization potential. As such, the early evolutionary history of the group as a whole is largely uncharted. Here we redescribe the 508-million-year-old stem-group onychophoran Hallucigenia sparsa(2-6) from the mid-Cambrian Burgess Shale. We document an elongate head with a pair of simple eyes, a terminal buccal chamber containing a radial array of sclerotized elements, and a differentiated foregut that is lined with acicular teeth. The radial elements and pharyngeal teeth resemble the sclerotized circumoral elements and pharyngeal teeth expressed in tardigrades(7-9), stem-group euarthropods(10-12) and cycloneuralian worms(13).

50,134,244.0,"The low-temperature states of bosonic fluids exhibit fundamental quantum effects at the macroscopic scale: the best-known examples are Bose-Einstein condensation and superfluidity, which have been tested experimentally in a variety of different systems. When bosons interact, disorder can destroy condensation, leading to a 'Bose glass'. This phase has been very elusive in experiments owing to the absence of any broken symmetry and to the simultaneous absence of a finite energy gap in the spectrum. Here we report the observation of a Bose glass of field-induced magnetic quasiparticles in a doped quantum magnet (bromine-doped dichloro-tetrakis-thiourea-nickel, DTN). The physics of DTN in a magnetic field is equivalent to that of a lattice gas of bosons in the grand canonical ensemble; bromine doping introduces disorder into the hopping and interaction strength of the bosons, leading to their localization into a Bose glass down to zero field, where it becomes an incompressible Mott glass. The transition from the Bose glass (corresponding to a gapless spin liquid) to the Bose-Einstein condensate (corresponding to a magnetically ordered phase) is marked by a universal exponent that governs the scaling of the critical temperature with the applied field, in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. Our study represents a quantitative experimental account of the universal features of disordered bosons in the grand canonical ensemble.","Yu, Rong; Yin, Liang; Sullivan, Neil S.; Xia, J.

51,41,117.0,"Gamma- ray line radiation at 511 keV is the signature of electron positron annihilation. Such radiation has been known for 30 years to come from the general direction of the Galactic Centre(1), but the origin of the positrons has remained a mystery. Stellar nucleosynthesis(2-4), accreting compact objects(5-8), and even the annihilation of exotic dark- matter particles(9) have all been suggested. Here we report a distinct asymmetry in the 511- keV line emission coming from the inner Galactic disk ( similar to 10-50 degrees from the Galactic Centre). This asymmetry resembles an asymmetry in the distribution of low mass X- ray binaries with strong emission at photon energies >20 keV ('hard' LMXBs), indicating that they may be the dominant origin of the positrons. Although it had long been suspected that electron - positron pair plasmas may exist in X- ray binaries, it was not evident that many of the positrons could escape to lose energy and ultimately annihilate with electrons in the interstellar medium and thus lead to the emission of a narrow 511- keV line. For these models, our result implies that up to a few times 10(41) positrons escape per second from a typical hard LMXB. Positron production at this level from hard LMXBs in the Galactic bulge would reduce ( and possibly eliminate) the need for more exotic explanations, such as those involving dark matter.","Weidenspointner, Georg; Skinner, Gerry; Jean, Pierre; Knoedlseder, Juergen; von Ballmoos, Peter; Bignami, Giovanni; Diehl, Roland; Strong, Andrew W.; Cordier, Bertrand; Schanne, Stephane; Winkler, Christoph","Weidenspointner, G; Skinner, G; Jean, P; Knodlseder, J; von Ballmoos, P; Bignami, G; Diehl, R; Strong, AW; Cordier, B; Schanne, S; Winkler, C",159.0,"[Weidenspointner, Georg; Skinner, Gerry; Jean, Pierre; Knoedlseder, Juergen; von Ballmoos, Peter; Bignami, Giovanni] UPS, CNRS, Ctr Etud Spatiale Rayonnements, Toulouse 4, France; [Weidenspointner, Georg; Diehl, Roland; Strong, Andrew W.] Max Planck Inst Extraterr Phys, D-85741 Garching, Germany; [Weidenspointner, Georg] MPI Halbleiterlab, D-81739 Munich, Germany; [Skinner, Gerry] NASA, CRESST, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Skinner, Gerry] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Skinner, Gerry] Univ Maryland, Dept Astron, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Cordier, Bertrand; Schanne, Stephane] CEA Saclay, SAp, DAPNIA, DSM, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Winkler, Christoph] ESA, ESTEC, SCI SA, NL-2201 AZ Noordwijk, Netherlands; [Bignami, Giovanni] IUSS, I-27100 Pavia, Italy",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06490,Article,,Georg.Weidenspointner@hll.mpg.de,162,,,249GA,,,ANNIHILATION RADIATION; SKY DISTRIBUTION; INNER GALAXY; BLACK-HOLE; MILKY-WAY; EMISSION; AL-26; SEARCH,7175.0,NATURE,Nature,English,29.0,No,"Bignami, Giovanni/0000-0001-9582-2450","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",10-Jan,4.0,LONDON,18185581.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,,"Weidenspointner, G (reprint author), UPS, CNRS, Ctr Etud Spatiale Rayonnements, BP 44346, Toulouse 4, France.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,127.0,An asymmetric distribution of positrons in the Galactic disk revealed by gamma-rays,0.0,4.0,WOS:000252214400035,117.0,451,Multidisciplinary Sciences,127,christoph,winkler,3976.0,192,male,1.0,HIF10V0AAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
52,148,430.0,"Active multiple sclerosis lesions show inflammatory changes suggestive of a combined attack by autoreactive T and B lymphocytes against brain white matter(1). These pathogenic immune cells derive from progenitors that are normal, innocuous components of the healthy immune repertoire but become autoaggressive upon pathological activation. The stimuli triggering this autoimmune conversion have been commonly attributed to environmental factors, in particular microbial infection(2). However, using the relapsing-remitting mouse model of spontaneously developing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis(3), here we show that the commensal gut flora-in the absence of pathogenic agents-is essential in triggering immune processes, leading to a relapsing-remitting autoimmune disease driven by myelin-specific CD4(+) T cells. We show further that recruitment and activation of autoantibody-producing B cells from the endogenous immune repertoire depends on availability of the target autoantigen, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), and commensal microbiota. Our observations identify a sequence of events triggering organ-specific autoimmune disease and these processes may offer novel therapeutic targets.","Berer, Kerstin; Mues, Marsilius; Koutrolos, Michail; Al Rasbi, Zakeya; Boziki, Marina; Johner, Caroline; Wekerle, Hartmut; Krishnamoorthy, Gurumoorthy","Berer, K; Mues, M; Koutrolos, M; Al Rasbi, Z; Boziki, M; Johner, C; Wekerle, H; Krishnamoorthy, G",538.0,"[Berer, Kerstin; Mues, Marsilius; Koutrolos, Michail; Al Rasbi, Zakeya; Boziki, Marina; Wekerle, Hartmut; Krishnamoorthy, Gurumoorthy] Max Planck Inst Neurobiol, Dept Neuroimmunol, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany; [Johner, Caroline] Max Planck Inst Immunobiol & Epigenet, D-79108 Freiburg, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10554,Article,,hwekerle@neuro.mpg.de; guru@neuro.mpg.de,U266,German Competence Network on Multiple Sclerosis (KKNMS); ARSEP (France); Max Planck Society; Emirates Foundation; Hellenic Neurological Society;  [SFB 571],"We thank I.

53,36,496.0,"Cells with loss of BRCA2 function are defective in homologous recombination ( HR) and are highly sensitive to inhibitors of poly( ADP- ribose) polymerase ( PARP)(1,2), which provides the basis for a new therapeutic approach. Here we show that resistance to PARP inhibition can be acquired by deletion of a mutation in BRCA2. We derived PARP- inhibitor- resistant ( PIR) clones from the human CAPAN1 pancreatic cancer cell line, which carries the protein- truncating c.6174delT frameshift mutation. PIR clones could form DNA- damage- induced RAD51 nuclear foci and were able to limit genotoxin- induced genomic instability, both hallmarks of a competent HR pathway. New BRCA2 isoforms were expressed in the resistant lines as a result of intragenic deletion of the c.6174delT mutation and restoration of the open reading frame ( ORF). Reconstitution of BRCA2- deficient cells with these revertant BRCA2 alleles rescued PARP inhibitor sensitivity and HR deficiency. Most of the deletions in BRCA2 were associated with small tracts of homology, and possibly arose from error-prone repair caused by BRCA2 deficiency(3,4). Similar ORF-restoring mutations were present in carboplatin- resistant ovarian tumours from c.6174delT mutation carriers. These observations have implications for understanding drug resistance in BRCA mutation carriers as well as in defining functionally important domains within BRCA2.","Edwards, Stacey L.; Brough, Rachel; Lord, Christopher J.; Natrajan, Rachael; Vatcheva, Radost; Levine, Douglas A.; Boyd, Jeff; Reis-Filho, Jorge S.; Ashworth, Alan","Edwards, SL; Brough, R; Lord, CJ; Natrajan, R; Vatcheva, R; Levine, DA; Boyd, J; Reis, JS; Ashworth, A",1111.0,"[Edwards, Stacey L.; Brough, Rachel; Lord, Christopher J.; Natrajan, Rachael; Vatcheva, Radost; Reis-Filho, Jorge S.; Ashworth, Alan] Inst Canc Res, Breakthrough Breast Canc Res Ctr, London SW3 6JB, England; [Levine, Douglas A.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Surg, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Boyd, Jeff] Mem Hlth Univ Med Ctr, Anderson Canc Inst, Savannah, GA 31404 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06548,Article,,alan.ashworth@icr.ac.uk,U8,Cancer Research UK [A8363],,266RB,,,HOMOLOGY-DIRECTED REPAIR; ADP-RIBOSE POLYMERASE; GENOMIC STABILITY; IMPROVED SURVIVAL; MUTANT-CELLS; CANCER; MUTATIONS; PROTEIN; BREAKS; DEFECT,7182.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,"Lord, Christopher/0000-0002-3226-0515; ","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",28-Feb,6.0,LONDON,18264088.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,"Lord, Christopher/B-3295-2012; Edwards, Stacey/A-4980-2011","Ashworth, A (reprint author), Inst Canc Res, Breakthrough Breast Canc Res Ctr, Fulham Rd, London SW3 6JB, England.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,485.0,Resistance to therapy caused by intragenic deletion in BRCA2,2.0,42.0,WOS:000253453600043,496.0,451,Multidisciplinary Sciences,493,alan,ashworth,2416.0,2079,male,1.0,hszK3CcAAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",25979414,1,25979414,1,Alan Ashworth,Alan Ashworth,1,1

Here we describe the complete skeleton of a new paravian from the Tiaojishan Formation of Liaoning Province, China. Including this new taxon in a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis for basal Paraves does the following: (1) it recovers it as the basal-most avialan; (2) it confirms the avialan status of Archaeopteryx; (3) it places Troodontidae as the sister-group to Avialae; (4) it supports a single origin of powered flight within Paraves; and (5) it implies that the early diversification of Paraves and Avialae took place in the Middle-Late Jurassic period.","Godefroit, Pascal; Cau, Andrea; Hu Dong-Yu; Escuillie, Franois; Wu Wenhao; Dyke, Gareth","Godefroit, P; Cau, A; Hu, DY; Escuillie, F; Wu, WH; Dyke, G",359.0,"[Godefroit, Pascal] Royal Belgian Inst Nat Sci, Operat Direct Earth & Hist Life, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [Cau, Andrea] Museo Geol Giovanni Capellini, I-40127 Bologna, Italy; [Hu Dong-Yu] Shenyang Normal Univ, Inst Paleontol, Shenyang 110034, Peoples R China; [Hu Dong-Yu] NE Normal Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Vegetat Ecol, Changchun 130024, Peoples R China; [Escuillie, Franois] Eldonia, F-3800 Gannat, France; [Wu Wenhao] Jilin Univ, Res Ctr Paleontol & Stratig, Changchun 130021, Peoples R China; [Dyke, Gareth] Univ Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12168,Article,,Pascal.Godefroit@naturalsciences.be,362,SPP Politique scientifique (Belgium) [BL/36/62]; Key Laboratory of Evolutionary Systematics of Vertebrates [CAS2011LESV011]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41172026],"We thank B.

55,26,190.0,"All adult flatfishes ( Pleuronectiformes), including the gastronomically familiar plaice, sole, turbot and halibut, have highly asymmetrical skulls, with both eyes placed on one side of the head. This arrangement, one of the most extraordinary anatomical specializations among vertebrates, arises through migration of one eye during late larval development. Although the transformation of symmetrical larvae into asymmetrical juveniles is well documented(1-7), the evolutionary origins of flatfish asymmetry are uncertain(1,2) because there are no transitional forms linking flatfishes with their symmetrical relatives(8,9). The supposed inviability of such intermediates gave pleuronectiforms a prominent role in evolutionary debates(10-16), leading to attacks on natural selection(11) and arguments for saltatory change(14,15). Here I show that Amphistium and the new genus Heteronectes, both extinct spiny- finned fishes from the Eocene epoch of Europe, are the most primitive pleuronectiforms known. The orbital region of the skull in both taxa is strongly asymmetrical, as in living flatfishes, but these genera retain many primitive characters unknown in extant forms. Most remarkably, orbital migration was incomplete in Amphistium and Heteronectes, with eyes remaining on opposite sides of the head in post- metamorphic individuals. This condition is intermediate between that in living pleuronectiforms and the arrangement found in other fishes. Amphistium and Heteronectes indicate that the evolution of the profound cranial asymmetry of extant flatfishes was gradual in nature.","Friedman, Matt","Friedman, M",209.0,"[Friedman, Matt] Univ Chicago, Comm Evolutionary Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Friedman, Matt] Field Museum Nat Hist, Dept Geol, Chicago, IL 60605 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07108,Article,,mattf@uchicago.edu,212,,,323RU,,,PLEURONECTIFORMES; ACANTHOMORPHS; PHYLOGENY; BEHAVIOR; RECORD,7201.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",10-Jul,4.0,LONDON,18615083.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,"Friedman, Matt/F-6991-2012","Friedman, M (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Comm Evolutionary Biol, 1025 E 57th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,59.0,The evolutionary origin of flatfish asymmetry,17.0,101.0,WOS:000257466900042,190.0,454,Multidisciplinary Sciences,64,matt,friedman,2883.0,4915,male,1.0,4d4zhI8AAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
56,147,426.0,"The earliest anatomically modern humans in Europe are thought to have appeared around 43,000-42,000 calendar years before present (43-42 kyr cal BP), by association with Aurignacian sites and lithic assemblages assumed to have been made by modern humans rather than by Neanderthals. However, the actual physical evidence for modern humans is extremely rare, and direct dates reach no farther back than about 41-39 kyr cal BP, leaving a gap. Here we show, using stratigraphic, chronological and archaeological data, that a fragment of human maxilla from the Kent's Cavern site, UK, dates to the earlier period. The maxilla (KC4), which was excavated in 1927, was initially diagnosed as Upper Palaeolithic modern human(1). In 1989, it was directly radiocarbon dated by accelerator mass spectrometry to 36.4-34.7 kyr cal BP2. Using a Bayesian analysis of new ultrafiltered bone collagen dates in an ordered stratigraphic sequence at the site, we show that this date is a considerable underestimate. Instead, KC4 dates to 44.2-41.5 kyr cal BP. This makes it older than any other equivalently dated modern human specimen and directly contemporary with the latest European Neanderthals, thus making its taxonomic attribution crucial. We also show that in 13 dental traits KC4 possesses modern human rather than Neanderthal characteristics; three other traits show Neanderthal affinities and a further seven are ambiguous. KC4 therefore represents the oldest known anatomically modern human fossil in northwestern Europe, fills a key gap between the earliest dated Aurignacian remains and the earliest human skeletal remains, and demonstrates the wide and rapid dispersal of early modern humans across Europe more than 40 kyr ago.","Higham, Tom; Compton, Tim; Stringer, Chris; Jacobi, Roger; Shapiro, Beth; Trinkaus, Erik; Chandler, Barry; Groening, Flora; Collins, Chris; Hillson, Simon; O'Higgins, Paul; FitzGerald, Charles; Fagan, Michael","Higham, T; Compton, T; Stringer, C; Jacobi, R; Shapiro, B; Trinkaus, E; Chandler, B; Groning, F; Collins, C; Hillson, S; O'Higgins, P; FitzGerald, C; Fagan, M",521.0,"[Higham, Tom] Univ Oxford, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Compton, Tim; Stringer, Chris; Jacobi, Roger; Collins, Chris] Nat Hist Museum, London SW7 5BD, England; [Jacobi, Roger] British Museum, Dept Prehist & Europe, Quaternary Sect, London N1 5QJ, England; [Shapiro, Beth] Penn State Univ, Dept Biol, Mueller Lab 208, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Trinkaus, Erik] Washington Univ, Dept Anthropol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Chandler, Barry] Torquay Museum, Torquay TQ1 1HG, Devon, England; [Groening, Flora; Fagan, Michael] Univ Hull, Dept Engn, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, Yorks, England; [Hillson, Simon] UCL, Inst Archaeol, London WC1H 0PY, England; [O'Higgins, Paul] Univ York, Hull York Med Sch, Ctr Anat & Human Sci, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [FitzGerald, Charles] McMaster Univ, Dept Anthropol, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L9, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10484,Article,,thomas.higham@rlaha.ox.ac.uk; c.stringer@nhm.ac.uk,524,NERC [NE/D014077/1]; Leverhulme Trust,"We thank R.

57,127,79.0,"Any thermodynamically stable or metastable phase corresponds to a local minimum of a potentially very complicated energy landscape. But however complex the crystal might be, this energy landscape is of parabolic shape near its minima. Roughly speaking, the depth of this energy well with respect to some reference level determines the thermodynamic stability of the system, and the steepness of the parabola near its minimum determines the system's elastic properties. Although changing alloying elements and their concentrations in a given material to enhance certain properties dates back to the Bronze Age(1,2), the systematic search for desirable properties in metastable atomic configurations at a fixed stoichiometry is a very recent tool in materials design(3). Here we demonstrate, using first-principles studies of four binary alloy systems, that the elastic properties of face-centred-cubic intermetallic compounds obey certain rules. We reach two conclusions based on calculations on a huge subset of the face-centred-cubic configuration space. First, the stiffness and the heat of formation are negatively correlated with a nearly constant Spearman correlation(4) for all concentrations. Second, the averaged stiffness of metastable configurations at a fixed concentration decays linearly with their distance to the ground-state line (the phase diagram of an alloy at zero Kelvin). We hope that our methods will help to simplify the quest for new materials with optimal properties from the vast configuration space available.","Maisel, Sascha B.; Hoefler, Michaela; Mueller, Stefan","Maisel, SB; Hofler, M; Muller, S",740.0,"[Maisel, Sascha B.; Hoefler, Michaela; Mueller, Stefan] Hamburg Univ Technol, Inst Adv Ceram, D-21073 Hamburg, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11609,Article,1476-4687,stefan.mueller@tuhh.de,+,DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) [Mu1648/5],Funding by the DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) grant Mu1648/5 is acknowledged.

58,64,27.0,"Radiative transfer of energy at the nanometre length scale is of great importance to a variety of technologies including heat-assisted magnetic recording(1), near-field thermophotovoltaics(2) and lithography(3). Although experimental advances have enabled elucidation of near-field radiative heat transfer in gaps as small as 20-30 nanometres (refs 4-6), quantitative analysis in the extreme near field (less than 10 nanometres) has been greatly limited by experimental challenges. Moreover, the results of pioneering measurements(7,8) differed from theoretical predictions by orders of magnitude. Here we use custom-fabricated scanning probes with embedded thermocouples(9,10), in conjunction with new microdevices capable of periodic temperature modulation, to measure radiative heat transfer down to gaps as small as two nanometres. For our experiments we deposited suitably chosen metal or dielectric layers on the scanning probes and microdevices, enabling direct study of extreme near-field radiation between silica-silica, silicon nitride-silicon nitride and gold-gold surfaces to reveal marked, gap-size-dependent enhancements of radiative heat transfer. Furthermore, our state-of-the-art calculations of radiative heat transfer, performed within the theoretical framework of fluctuational electrodynamics, are in excellent agreement with our experimental results, providing unambiguous evidence that confirms the validity of this theory(11-13) for modelling radiative heat transfer in gaps as small as a few nanometres. This work lays the foundations required for the rational design of novel technologies that leverage nanoscale radiative heat transfer.","Kim, Kyeongtae; Song, Bai; Fernandez-Hurtado, Victor; Lee, Woochul; Jeong, Wonho; Cui, Longji; Thompson, Dakotah; Feist, Johannes; Reid, M.

59,28,249.0,"Haems are metalloporphyrins that serve as prosthetic groups for various biological processes including respiration, gas sensing, xenobiotic detoxification, cell differentiation, circadian clock control, metabolic reprogramming and microRNA processing(1-4). With a few exceptions, haem is synthesized by a multistep biosynthetic pathway comprising defined intermediates that are highly conserved throughout evolution(5). Despite our extensive knowledge of haem biosynthesis and degradation, the cellular pathways and molecules that mediate intracellular haem trafficking are unknown. The experimental setback in identifying haem trafficking pathways has been the inability to dissociate the highly regulated cellular synthesis and degradation of haem from intracellular trafficking events(6). Caenorhabditis elegans and related helminths are natural haem auxotrophs that acquire environmental haem for incorporation into haemoproteins, which have vertebrate orthologues(7). Here we show, by exploiting this auxotrophy to identify HRG-1 proteins in C. elegans, that these proteins are essential for haem homeostasis and normal development in worms and vertebrates. Depletion of hrg-1, or its paralogue hrg-4, in worms results in the disruption of organismal haem sensing and an abnormal response to haem analogues. HRG-1 and HRG-4 are previously unknown transmembrane proteins, which reside in distinct intracellular compartments. Transient knockdown of hrg-1 in zebrafish leads to hydrocephalus, yolk tube malformations and, most strikingly, profound defects in erythropoiesis-phenotypes that are fully rescued by worm HRG-1. Human and worm proteins localize together, and bind and transport haem, thus establishing an evolutionarily conserved function for HRG-1. These findings reveal conserved pathways for cellular haem trafficking in animals that define the model for eukaryotic haem transport. Thus, uncovering the mechanisms of haem transport in C. elegans may provide insights into human disorders of haem metabolism and reveal new drug targets for developing anthelminthics to combat worm infestations.","Rajagopal, Abbhirami; Rao, Anita U.; Amigo, Julio; Tian, Meng; Upadhyay, Sanjeev K.; Hall, Caitlin; Uhm, Suji; Mathew, M.

Several smaller moonlets and clumps have been detected in the ring's immediate vicinity, and a population of embedded objects has been inferred. Here we report direct evidence of moonlets embedded in the ring's bright core, and show that most of the F ring's morphology results from the continual gravitational and collisional effects of small satellites, often combined with the perturbing effect of Prometheus.

There are four known triple black hole systems(5-8), with the closest black hole pair being 2.4 kiloparsecs apart (the third component in this system is at 3 kiloparsecs)(7), which is far from the gravitational sphere of influence (about 100 parsecs for a black hole with mass one billion times that of the Sun). Previous searches for compact black hole systems concluded that they were rare(9), with the tightest binary system having a separation of 7 parsecs (ref. 10). Here we report observations of a triple black hole system at redshift z = 0.39, with the closest pair separated by about 140 parsecs and significantly more distant from Earth than any other known binary of comparable orbital separation. The effect of the tight pair is to introduce a rotationally symmetric helical modulation on the structure of the large-scale radio jets, which provides a useful way to search for other tight pairs without needing extremely high resolution observations. As we found this tight pair after searching only six galaxies, we conclude that tight pairs are more common than hitherto believed, which is an important observational constraint for low-frequency gravitational wave experiments(11,12).","Deane, R.

63,51,285.0,"Malaria parasites and related Apicomplexans are the causative agents of the some of the most serious infectious diseases of humans, companion animals, livestock and wildlife. These parasites must undergo sexual reproduction to transmit from vertebrate hosts to vectors, and their sex ratios are consistently female- biased. Sex allocation theory, a cornerstone of evolutionary biology, is remarkably successful at explaining female- biased sex ratios in multicellular taxa, but has proved controversial when applied to malaria parasites. Here we show that, as predicted by theory, sex ratio is an important fitness- determining trait and Plasmodium chabaudi parasites adjust their sex allocation in response to the presence of unrelated conspecifics. This suggests that P. chabaudi parasites use kin discrimination to evaluate the genetic diversity of their infections, and they adjust their behaviour in response to environmental cues. Malaria parasites provide a novel way to test evolutionary theory, and support the generality and power of a darwinian approach.","Reece, Sarah E.; Drew, Damien R.; Gardner, Andy","Reece, SE; Drew, DR; Gardner, A",609.0,"[Reece, Sarah E.; Gardner, Andy] Univ Edinburgh, Inst Evolut Biol, Ashworth Labs, Sch Biol Sci, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland; [Reece, Sarah E.; Drew, Damien R.] Univ Edinburgh, Inst Immunol & Infect Res, Ashworth Labs, Sch Biol Sci, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland; [Drew, Damien R.] Walter & Eliza Hall Inst Med Res, Ctr Biotechnol, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06954,Article,1476-4687,sarah.reece@ed.ac.uk,U1,Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council; Wellcome Trust,,305NN,,,LOCAL MATE COMPETITION; PLASMODIUM-FALCIPARUM; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; TOXOPLASMA-GONDII; BLOOD PARASITES; PREMATURE REJECTION; FERTILITY INSURANCE; EVOLUTION; VIRULENCE; TRANSMISSION,7195.0,NATURE,Nature,English,50.0,No,"Reece, Sarah/0000-0001-6716-6732; Gardner, Andy/0000-0002-1304-3734","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",29-May,7.0,LONDON,18509435.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,"Reece, Sarah/C-9447-2009; Gardner, Andy/K-5353-2013","Reece, SE (reprint author), Univ Edinburgh, Inst Evolut Biol, Ashworth Labs, Sch Biol Sci, W Mains Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,117.0,Sex ratio adjustment and kin discrimination in malaria parasites,1.0,32.0,WOS:000256185200034,285.0,453,Multidisciplinary Sciences,121,andy,gardner,9271.0,3139,male,0.95,WQrZYMIAAAAJ,3,"(4126, 9345]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
64,196,390.0,"Fertilization of the ocean by adding iron compounds has induced diatom-dominated phytoplankton blooms accompanied by considerable carbon dioxide drawdown in the ocean surface layer. However, because the fate of bloom biomass could not be adequately resolved in these experiments, the timescales of carbon sequestration from the atmosphere are uncertain. Here we report the results of a five-week experiment carried out in the closed core of a vertically coherent, mesoscale eddy of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, during which we tracked sinking particles from the surface to the deep-sea floor. A large diatom bloom peaked in the fourth week after fertilization. This was followed by mass mortality of several diatom species that formed rapidly sinking, mucilaginous aggregates of entangled cells and chains. Taken together, multiple lines of evidence-although each with important uncertainties-lead us to conclude that at least half the bloom biomass sank far below a depth of 1,000 metres and that a substantial portion is likely to have reached the sea floor. Thus, iron-fertilized diatom blooms may sequester carbon for timescales of centuries in ocean bottom water and for longer in the sediments.","Smetacek, Victor; Klaas, Christine; Strass, Volker H.; Assmy, Philipp; Montresor, Marina; Cisewski, Boris; Savoye, Nicolas; Webb, Adrian; d'Ovidio, Francesco; Arrieta, Jesus M.; Bathmann, Ulrich; Bellerby, Richard; Berg, Gry Mine; Croot, Peter; Gonzalez, Santiago; Henjes, Joachim; Herndl, Gerhard J.; Hoffmann, Linn J.; Leach, Harry; Losch, Martin; Mills, Matthew M.; Neill, Craig; Peeken, Ilka; Roettgers, Ruediger; Sachs, Oliver; Sauter, Eberhard; Schmidt, Maike M.; Schwarz, Jill; Terbrueggen, Anja; Wolf-Gladrow, Dieter","Smetacek, V; Klaas, C; Strass, VH; Assmy, P; Montresor, M; Cisewski, B; Savoye, N; Webb, A; d'Ovidio, F; Arrieta, JM; Bathmann, U; Bellerby, R; Berg, GM; Croot, P; Gonzalez, S; Henjes, J; Herndl, GJ; Hoffmann, LJ; Leach, H; Losch, M; Mills, MM; Neill, C; Peeken, I; Rottgers, R; Sachs, O; Sauter, E; Schmidt, MM; Schwarz, J; Terbruggen, A; Wolf-Gladrow, D",313.0,"[Smetacek, Victor; Klaas, Christine; Strass, Volker H.; Assmy, Philipp; Cisewski, Boris; Bathmann, Ulrich; Henjes, Joachim; Losch, Martin; Peeken, Ilka; Sachs, Oliver; Sauter, Eberhard; Schwarz, Jill; Terbrueggen, Anja; Wolf-Gladrow, Dieter] Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, D-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany; [Smetacek, Victor] Natl Inst Oceanog, Panaji 403004, Goa, India; [Assmy, Philipp] Norwegian Polar Res Inst, Fram Ctr, N-9296 Tromso, Norway; [Montresor, Marina] Stn Zool Anton Dohrn, I-80121 Naples, Italy; [Cisewski, Boris] Johann Heinrich von Thunen Inst, Inst Sea Fisheries, D-22767 Hamburg, Germany; [Savoye, Nicolas] Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Analyt & Environm Chem, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Savoye, Nicolas] Univ Bordeaux, CNRS, EPOC, UMR 5805,Stn Marine Arcachon, F-33120 Arcachon, France; [Webb, Adrian] Univ Cape Town, Dept Oceanog, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa; [d'Ovidio, Francesco] CNRS UPMC IRD MNHN, LOCEAN IPSL, F-75252 Paris, France; [Arrieta, Jesus M.; Gonzalez, Santiago; Herndl, Gerhard J.] Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, Dept Biol Oceanog, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Netherlands; [Arrieta, Jesus M.] CSIC UIB, Inst Mediterraneo Estudios Avanzados, Dept Global Change Res, Esporles 07190, Mallorca, Spain; [Bathmann, Ulrich] Leibniz Inst Balt Sea Res Warnemunde, D-18119 Rostock, Germany; [Bellerby, Richard; Neill, Craig] Univ Bergen, Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, N-5007 Bergen, Norway; [Bellerby, Richard] Norwegian Inst Water Res, N-5006 Bergen, Norway; [Berg, Gry Mine; Mills, Matthew M.] Stanford Univ, Dept Environm Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Croot, Peter; Hoffmann, Linn J.] Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Croot, Peter] Natl Univ Ireland, Sch Nat Sci, Galway, Ireland; [Henjes, Joachim] Phytolut GmbH, D-28759 Bremen, Germany; [Herndl, Gerhard J.] Univ Vienna, Dept Marine Biol, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Leach, Harry] Univ Liverpool, Sch Environm Sci, Liverpool L69 3GP, Merseyside, England; [Neill, Craig] Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org, Wealth Oceans Flagship, Hobart, Tas 7000, Australia; [Peeken, Ilka] Univ Bremen, MARUM Ctr Marine Environm Sci, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Roettgers, Ruediger] Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Ctr Mat & Coastal Res, Inst Coastal Res, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany; [Sachs, Oliver] Eberhard & Partner AG, CH-5000 Aarau, Switzerland; [Schmidt, Maike M.] Univ Bremen, Ctr Biomol Interact Bremen, FB 2, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Schwarz, Jill] Univ Plymouth, Sch Marine Sci & Engn, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11229,Article,,victor.smetacek@awi.de; christine.klaas@awi.de,319,Cnes,"We thank C.

Alfven waves (travelling oscillations of ions and magnetic field) have been invoked as a possible mechanism to transport magneto-convective energy upwards along the Sun's magnetic field lines into the corona. Previous observations(7) of Alfvenic waves in the corona revealed amplitudes far too small (0.5 km s(-1)) to supply the energy flux (100-200 W m(-2)) required to drive the fast solar wind(8) or balance the radiative losses of the quiet corona(9). Here we report observations of the transition region (between the chromosphere and the corona) and of the corona that reveal how Alfvenic motions permeate the dynamic and finely structured outer solar atmosphere. The ubiquitous outward-propagating Alfvenic motions observed have amplitudes of the order of 20 km s(-1) and periods of the order of 100-500 s throughout the quiescent atmosphere (compatible with recent investigations(7,10)), and are energetic enough to accelerate the fast solar wind and heat the quiet corona.","McIntosh, Scott W.; De Pontieu, Bart; Carlsson, Mats; Hansteen, Viggo; Boerner, Paul; Goossens, Marcel","McIntosh, SW; De Pontieu, B; Carlsson, M; Hansteen, V; Boerner, P; Goossens, M",477.0,"[McIntosh, Scott W.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, High Altitude Observ, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [De Pontieu, Bart; Hansteen, Viggo; Boerner, Paul] Lockheed Martin Solar & Astrophys Lab, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA; [Carlsson, Mats; Hansteen, Viggo] Univ Oslo, Inst Theoret Astrophys, N-0315 Oslo, Norway; [Goossens, Marcel] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Math, Ctr Plasma Astrophys, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10235,Article,1476-4687,mscott@ucar.edu,480,NSF,SDO is the first mission of NASA's Living With a Star Program.

66,116,450.0,"Ubiquinone (also known as coenzyme Q) is a ubiquitous lipid-soluble redox cofactor that is an essential component of electron transfer chains(1). Eleven genes have been implicated in bacterial ubiquinone biosynthesis, including ubiX and ubiD, which are responsible for decarboxylation of the 3-octaprenyl-4-hydroxy-benzoate precursor(2). Despite structural and biochemical characterization of UbiX as a flavin mononucleotide (FMN)-binding protein, no decarboxylase activity has been detected(3,4). Here we report that UbiX produces a novel flavin-derived cofactor required for the decarboxylase activity of UbiD(5). UbiX acts as a flavin prenyltransferase, linking a dimethylallyl moiety to the flavin N5 and C6 atoms. This adds a fourth non-aromatic ring to the flavin isoalloxazine group. In contrast to other prenyltransferases(6,7), UbiX is metal-independent and requires dimethylallyl-monophosphate as substrate. Kinetic crystallography reveals that the prenyltransferase mechanism of UbiX resembles that of the terpene synthases(8). The active site environment is dominated by pi systems, which assist phosphate-C1' bond breakage following FMN reduction, leading to formation of the N5-C1' bond. UbiX then acts as a chaperone for adduct reorientation, via transient carbocation species, leading ultimately to formation of the dimethylallyl C3'-C6 bond. Our findings establish the mechanism for formation of a new flavin-derived cofactor, extending both flavin and terpenoid biochemical repertoires.","White, Mark D.; Payne, Karl A.

67,115,449.0,"The bacterial ubiD and ubiX or the homologous fungal fdc1 and pad1 genes have been implicated in the non-oxidative reversible decarboxylation of aromatic substrates, and play a pivotal role in bacterial ubiquinone (also known as coenzyme Q) biosynthesis(1-3) or microbial biodegradation of aromatic compounds(4-6), respectively. Despite biochemical studies on individual gene products, the composition and cofactor requirement of the enzyme responsible for in vivo decarboxylase activity remained unclear(7-9). Here we show that Fdc1 is solely responsible for the reversible decarboxylase activity, and that it requires a new type of cofactor: a prenylated flavin synthesized by the associated UbiX/Pad1(10). Atomic resolution crystal structures reveal that two distinct isomers of the oxidized cofactor can be observed, an isoalloxazine N5-iminium adduct and a N5 secondary ketimine species with markedly altered ring structure, both having azomethine ylide character. Substrate binding positions the dipolarophile enoic acid group directly above the azomethine ylide group. The structure of a covalent inhibitor-cofactor adduct suggests that 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition chemistry supports reversible decarboxylation in these enzymes. Although 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition is commonly used in organic chemistry(11,12), we propose that this presents the first example, to our knowledge, of an enzymatic 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction. Our model for Fdc1/UbiD catalysis offers new routes in alkene hydrocarbon production or aryl (de) carboxylation.","Payne, Karl A.

68,35,405.0,"Madagascar hosts one of the world's most unusual, endemic, diverse and threatened concentrations of fauna(1). To explain its unique, imbalanced biological diversity, G. G. Simpson proposed the 'sweepstakes hypothesis', according to which the ancestors of Madagascar's present-day mammal stock rafted there from Africa(2). This is an important hypothesis in biogeography and evolutionary theory for how animals colonize new frontiers(1,3-5), but its validity is questioned(5-9). Studies suggest that currents were inconsistent with rafting to Madagascar(9) and that land bridges provided the migrants' passage(5-8). Here we show that currents could have transported the animals to the island and highlight evidence inconsistent with the land-bridge hypothesis. Using palaeogeographic reconstructions and palaeo-oceanographic modelling, we find that strong surface currents flowed from northeast Mozambique and Tanzania eastward towards Madagascar during the Palaeogene period, exactly as required by the 'sweepstakes process'. Subsequently, Madagascar advanced north towards the equatorial gyre and the regional current system evolved into its modern configuration with flows westward(10) from Madagascar to Africa. This may explain why no fully non-aquatic land mammals have colonized Madagascar since the arrival of the rodents and carnivorans during the early-Miocene epoch. One implication is that rafting may be the dominant means of overseas dispersal in the Cenozoic era when palaeocurrent directions are properly considered.","Ali, Jason R.; Huber, Matthew","Ali, JR; Huber, M",653.0,"[Huber, Matthew] Purdue Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Huber, Matthew] Purdue Univ, Purdue Climate Change Res Ctr, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Ali, Jason R.] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Earth Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08706,Article,,huberm@purdue.edu,U80,US National Science Foundation (NSF) [0927946-ATM],"M.

69,78,91.0,"The terrestrial sediment record indicates that the Earth's climate varied drastically in the Precambrian era ( before 550 million years ago), ranging from surface temperatures similar to or higher than today's to global glaciation events(1). The most continuous record of sea surface temperatures of that time has been derived from variations in oxygen isotope ratios of cherts (siliceous sediments)(2), but the long-term cooling of the oceans inferred from those data(3-5) has been questioned because the oxygen isotope signature could have been reset through the exchange with hydrothermal fluids after deposition of the sediments(6). Here we show that the silicon isotopic composition of cherts more than 550 million years old shows systematic variations with age that support the earlier conclusion of long-term ocean cooling and exclude post-depositional exchange as the main source of the isotopic variations. In agreement with other lines of evidence(1,7), a model of the silicon cycle in the Precambrian era shows that the observed silicon isotope variations imply seawater temperature changes from about 70 degrees C 3,500 million years ago to about 20 degrees C 800 million years ago.","Robert, Francois; Chaussidon, Marc","Robert, F; Chaussidon, M",969.0,"Museum Natl Hist Nat, CNRS, LEME Nanoanal, UMS 2679, F-75005 Paris, France; Ctr Rech Petrog & Geochim, CRPG, CNRS, F-54501 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature05239,Article,,robert@mnhn.fr; chocho@crpg.cnrs-nancy.fr,972,,,098LZ,,,SOUTH-AFRICA; GEOCHEMISTRY; EVOLUTION; RATIOS; CHINA; MICROFOSSILS; TEMPERATURE; SOLUBILITY; DIATOMS; CYCLE,7114.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",26-Oct,4.0,LONDON,17066030.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,"Chaussidon, Marc/E-7067-2017","Robert, F (reprint author), Museum Natl Hist Nat, CNRS, LEME Nanoanal, UMS 2679, 57 Rue Cuvier, F-75005 Paris, France.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,176.0,A palaeotemperature curve for the Precambrian oceans based on silicon isotopes in cherts,3.0,50.0,WOS:000241523400049,91.0,443,Multidisciplinary Sciences,190,marc,chaussidon,8471.0,1555,male,1.0,PDpfUb4AAAAJ,3,"(4126, 9345]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
70,42,216.0,"The early vertebrate skeletal muscle is a well- organized tissue in which the primitive muscle fibres, the myocytes, are all parallel and aligned along the antero- posterior axis of the embryo. How myofibres acquire their orientation during development is unknown. Here we show that during early chick myogenesis WNT11 has an essential role in the oriented elongation of the myocytes. We find that the neural tube, known to drive WNT11 expression in the medial border of somites(1), is necessary and sufficient to orient myocyte elongation. We then show that the specific inhibition of WNT11 function in somites leads to the disorganization of myocytes. We establish that WNT11 mediates this effect through the evolutionary conserved planar cell polarity ( PCP) pathway, downstream of the WNT/beta-catenin-dependent pathway, required to initiate the myogenic program of myocytes and WNT11 expression. Finally, we demonstrate that a localized ectopic source of WNT11 can markedly change the orientation of myocytes, indicating that WNT11 acts as a directional cue in this process. All together, these data show that the sequential action of the WNT/ PCP and the WNT/beta-catenin pathways is necessary for the formation of fully functional embryonic muscle fibres. This study also provides evidence that WNTs can act as instructive cues to regulate the PCP pathway in vertebrates.","Gros, Jerome; Serralbo, Olivier; Marcelle, Christophe","Gros, J; Serralbo, O; Marcelle, C",589.0,"[Gros, Jerome; Serralbo, Olivier; Marcelle, Christophe] Univ Aix Marseille 2, CNRS, Dev Biol Inst Marseille Luminy IBDML, UMR 6216, F-13288 Marseille 09, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07564,Article,,marcelle@ibdm.univ-mrs.fr,U97,Actions Concertees Incitatives; Agence Nationale de la Recherche; Association Francaise contre les Myopathies; EU 6th Framework Programme Network of Excellence MYORES,"We thank C.

71,74,391.0,"The Plio-Pleistocene site of Dmanisi, Georgia, has yielded a rich fossil and archaeological record documenting an early presence of the genus Homo outside Africa. Although the craniomandibular morphology of early Homo is well known as a result of finds from Dmanisi and African localities, data about its postcranial morphology are still relatively scarce. Here we describe newly excavated postcranial material from Dmanisi comprising a partial skeleton of an adolescent individual, associated with skull D2700/D2735, and the remains from three adult individuals. This material shows that the postcranial anatomy of the Dmanisi hominins has a surprising mosaic of primitive and derived features. The primitive features include a small body size, a low encephalization quotient and absence of humeral torsion; the derived features include modern-human-like body proportions and lower limb morphology indicative of the capability for long-distance travel. Thus, the earliest known hominins to have lived outside of Africa in the temperate zones of Eurasia did not yet display the full set of derived skeletal features.","Lordkipanidze, David; Jashashvili, Tea; Vekua, Abesalom; de Leon, Marcia S.

72,106,307.0,"Cell division requires the precise coordination of chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. This coordination is achieved by the recruitment of an actomyosin regulator, Ect2, to overlapping microtubules at the centre of the elongating anaphase spindle(1). Ect2 then signals to the overlying cortex to promote the assembly and constriction of an actomyosin ring between segregating chromosomes(1). Here, by studying division in proliferating Drosophila and human cells, we demonstrate the existence of a second, parallel signalling pathway, which triggers the relaxation of the polar cell cortex at mid anaphase. This is independent of furrow formation, centrosomes and microtubules and, instead, depends on PP1 phosphatase and its regulatory subunit Sds22 (refs 2, 3). As separating chromosomes move towards the polar cortex at mid anaphase, kinetochore-localized PP1-Sds22 helps to break cortical symmetry by inducing the dephosphorylation and inactivation of ezrin/radixin/moesin proteins at cell poles. This promotes local softening of the cortex(2,3), facilitating anaphase elongation and orderly cell division. In summary, this identifies a conserved kinetochore-based phosphatase signal and substrate, which function together to link anaphase chromosome movements to cortical polarization, thereby coupling chromosome segregation to cell division.","Rodrigues, Nelio T.

73,9,220.0,"Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC)-the macroscopic ground-state accumulation of particles with integer spin (bosons) at low temperature and high density-has been observed in several physical systems(1-9), including cold atomic gases and solid-state quasiparticles. However, the most omnipresent Bose gas, blackbody radiation (radiation in thermal equilibrium with the cavity walls) does not show this phase transition. In such systems photons have a vanishing chemical potential, meaning that their number is not conserved when the temperature of the photon gas is varied(10); at low temperatures, photons disappear in the cavity walls instead of occupying the cavity ground state. Theoretical works have considered thermalization processes that conserve photon number (a prerequisite for BEC), involving Compton scattering with a gas of thermal electrons(11) or photon-photon scattering in a nonlinear resonator configuration(12,13). Number-conserving thermalization was experimentally observed(14) for a two-dimensional photon gas in a dye-filled optical microcavity, which acts as a 'white-wall' box. Here we report the observation of a Bose-Einstein condensate of photons in this system. The cavity mirrors provide both a confining potential and a nonvanishing effective photon mass, making the system formally equivalent to a two-dimensional gas of trapped, massive bosons. The photons thermalize to the temperature of the dye solution (room temperature) by multiple scattering with the dye molecules. Upon increasing the photon density, we observe the following BEC signatures: the photon energies have a Bose-Einstein distribution with a massively populated ground-state mode on top of a broad thermal wing; the phase transition occurs at the expected photon density and exhibits the predicted dependence on cavity geometry; and the ground-state mode emerges even for a spatially displaced pump spot. The prospects of the observed effects include studies of extremely weakly interacting low-dimensional Bose gases(9) and new coherent ultraviolet sources(15).","Klaers, Jan; Schmitt, Julian; Vewinger, Frank; Weitz, Martin","Klaers, J; Schmitt, J; Vewinger, F; Weitz, M",545.0,"[Klaers, Jan; Schmitt, Julian; Vewinger, Frank; Weitz, Martin] Univ Bonn, Inst Angew Phys, D-53115 Bonn, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09567,Article,,martin.weitz@uni-bonn.de,548,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft within the focused research unit [FOR557]; IFRAF at LKB Paris,"We thank J.

74,24,167.0,"Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are transcriptional repressors that control processes ranging from the maintenance of cell fate decisions and stem cell pluripotency in animals to the control of flowering time in plants(1-6). In Drosophila, genetic studies identified more than 15 different PcG proteins that are required to repress homeotic (HOX) and other developmental regulator genes in cells where they must stay inactive(1,7,8). Biochemical analyses established that these PcG proteins exist in distinct multiprotein complexes that bind to and modify chromatin of target genes(1-4). Among those, Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) and the related dRing-associated factors (dRAF) complex contain an E3 ligase activity for monoubiquitination of histone H2A (refs 1-4). Here we show that the uncharacterized Drosophila PcG gene calypso encodes the ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase BAP1. Biochemically purified Calypso exists in a complex with the PcG protein ASX, and this complex, named Polycomb repressive deubiquitinase (PR-DUB), is bound at PcG target genes in Drosophila. Reconstituted recombinant Drosophila and human PR-DUB complexes remove monoubiquitin from H2A but not from H2B in nucleosomes. Drosophila mutants lacking PR-DUB show a strong increase in the levels of monoubiquitinated H2A. A mutation that disrupts the catalytic activity of Calypso, or absence of the ASX subunit abolishes H2A deubiquitination in vitro and HOX gene repression in vivo. Polycomb gene silencing may thus entail adynamic balance between H2A ubiquitination by PRC1 and dRAF, and H2A deubiquitination by PR-DUB.","Scheuermann, Johanna C.; Alonso, Andres Gaytan de Ayala; Oktaba, Katarzyna; Ly-Hartig, Nga; McGinty, Robert K.; Fraterman, Sven; Wilm, Matthias; Muir, Tom W.; Mueller, Juerg","Scheuermann, JC; Alonso, AGD; Oktaba, K; Ly-Hartig, N; McGinty, RK; Fraterman, S; Wilm, M; Muir, TW; Muller, J",243.0,"[Scheuermann, Johanna C.; Alonso, Andres Gaytan de Ayala; Oktaba, Katarzyna; Ly-Hartig, Nga; Fraterman, Sven; Wilm, Matthias; Mueller, Juerg] European Mol Biol Lab, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [McGinty, Robert K.; Muir, Tom W.] Rockefeller Univ, New York, NY 10065 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08966,Article,,juerg.mueller@embl.de,U138,NIH [RC2CA148354]; EMBL; DFG,"We thank T.

75,18,490.0,"Graphene nanoribbons-narrow and straight-edged stripes of graphene, or single-layer graphite-are predicted to exhibit electronic properties that make them attractive for the fabrication of nanoscale electronic devices(1-3). In particular, although the twodimensional parent material graphene(4,5) exhibits semimetallic behaviour, quantum confinement and edge effects(2,6) should render all graphene nanoribbons with widths smaller than 10 nm semiconducting. But exploring the potential of graphene nanoribbons is hampered by their limited availability: although they have been made using chemical(7-9), sonochemical(10) and lithographic(11,12) methods as well as through the unzipping of carbon nanotubes(13-16), the reliable production of graphene nanoribbons smaller than 10 nm with chemical precision remains a significant challenge. Here we report a simple method for the production of atomically precise graphene nanoribbons of different topologies and widths, which uses surface-assisted coupling(17,18) of molecular precursors into linear polyphenylenes and their subsequent cyclodehydrogenation(19,20). The topology, width and edge periphery of the graphene nanoribbon products are defined by the structure of the precursor monomers, which can be designed to give access to a wide range of different graphene nanoribbons. We expect that our bottom-up approach to the atomically precise fabrication of graphene nanoribbons will finally enable detailed experimental investigations of the properties of this exciting class of materials. It should even provide a route to graphene nanoribbon structures with engineered chemical and electronic properties, including the theoretically predicted intraribbon quantum dots(21), superlattice structures(22) and magnetic devices based on specific graphene nanoribbon edge states(3).","Cai, Jinming; Ruffieux, Pascal; Jaafar, Rached; Bieri, Marco; Braun, Thomas; Blankenburg, Stephan; Muoth, Matthias; Seitsonen, Ari P.; Saleh, Moussa; Feng, Xinliang; Muellen, Klaus; Fasel, Roman","Cai, JM; Ruffieux, P; Jaafar, R; Bieri, M; Braun, T; Blankenburg, S; Muoth, M; Seitsonen, AP; Saleh, M; Feng, XL; Mullen, K; Fasel, R",470.0,"[Cai, Jinming; Ruffieux, Pascal; Jaafar, Rached; Bieri, Marco; Braun, Thomas; Blankenburg, Stephan; Fasel, Roman] Empa, Swiss Fed Labs Mat Sci & Technol, Nanotech Surfaces Lab, CH-3602 Thun, Switzerland; [Cai, Jinming; Ruffieux, Pascal; Jaafar, Rached; Bieri, Marco; Braun, Thomas; Blankenburg, Stephan; Fasel, Roman] Empa, Swiss Fed Labs Mat Sci & Technol, Nanotech Surfaces Lab, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Muoth, Matthias] ETH, Dept Mech & Proc Engn Micro & Nanosyst, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Seitsonen, Ari P.] Univ Zurich, Inst Phys Chem, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Seitsonen, Ari P.] CNRS, IMPMC, F-75252 Paris, France; [Seitsonen, Ari P.] Univ Paris 06, F-75252 Paris, France; [Saleh, Moussa; Feng, Xinliang; Muellen, Klaus] Max Planck Inst Polymer Res, D-55124 Mainz, Germany; [Fasel, Roman] Univ Bern, Dept Chem & Biochem, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09211,Article,,muellen@mpip-mainz.mpg.de; roman.fasel@empa.ch,473,"Swiss National Science Foundation; NCCR Nanoscale Science; Max Planck Society; German Science Foundation (Korean-German IRTG); DFG [SPP 1355, DFG MU 334/32-1]","This work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation and the NCCR Nanoscale Science.

76,139,484.0,"Modern observations of the geomagnetic field reveal fluctuations(1-3) with a dominant period of about 60 years. These fluctuations are probably a result of waves in the liquid core(4), although the precise nature of the waves is uncertain. Common suggestions include a type of magnetic wave, known as a torsional oscillation(5), but recent studies(6) favour periods that are too short to account for a 60-year fluctuation. Another possibility involves MAC waves(7), which arise from the interplay between magnetic, Archimedes and Coriolis forces. Waves with a suitable period can emerge when the top of the core is stably stratified. Here I show that MAC waves provide a good description of time-dependent zonal flow at the top of the core(8), as inferred from geomagnetic secular variation(9). The same wave motion can also account for unexplained fluctuations in the dipole field(10). Both of these independent predictions require a 140-kilometre-thick stratified layer with a buoyancy frequency comparable to the Earth's rotation rate. Such a stratified layer could have a thermal origin(11,12), implying a core heat flow of about 13 terawatts. Alternatively, the layer could result from chemical stratification(13,14). In either case, the existence of a stratified layer at the top of the core obscures the nature of flow deeper in the core, where the magnetic field is continually regenerated.","Buffett, Bruce","Buffett, B",484.0,"Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13122,Article,1476-4687,bbuffett@berkeley.edu,+,US National Science Foundation [EAR-1045277],A.

Here we show that Na(v)1.7 is not only necessary for pain sensation but is also an essential requirement for odour perception in both mice and humans. We examined human patients with loss-of-function mutations in SCN9A and show that they are unable to sense odours. To establish the essential role of Na(v)1.7 in odour perception, we generated conditional null mice in which Na(v)1.7 was removed from all olfactory sensory neurons. In the absence of Na(v)1.7, these neurons still produce odour-evoked action potentials but fail to initiate synaptic signalling from their axon terminals at the first synapse in the olfactory system. The mutant mice no longer display vital, odour-guided behaviours such as innate odour recognition and avoidance, short-term odour learning, and maternal pup retrieval. Our study creates a mouse model of congenital general anosmia and provides new strategies to explore the genetic basis of the human sense of smell.","Weiss, Jan; Pyrski, Martina; Jacobi, Eric; Bufe, Bernd; Willnecker, Vivienne; Schick, Bernhard; Zizzari, Philippe; Gossage, Samuel J.; Greer, Charles A.; Leinders-Zufall, Trese; Woods, C.

79,113,428.0,"Sex determination in animals is amazingly plastic. Vertebrates display contrasting strategies ranging from complete genetic control of sex (genotypic sex determination) to environmentally determined sex (for example, temperature-dependent sex determination)(1). Phylogenetic analyses suggest frequent evolutionary transitions between genotypic and temperature-dependent sex determination in environmentally sensitive lineages, including reptiles(2). These transitions are thought to involve a genotypic system becoming sensitive to temperature, with sex determined by gene-environment interactions(3). Most mechanistic models of transitions invoke a role for sex reversal(3-5). Sex reversal has not yet been demonstrated in nature for any amniote, although it occurs in fish(6) and rarely in amphibians(7,8). Here we make the first report of reptile sex reversal in the wild, in the Australian bearded dragon (Pogona vitticeps), and use sex-reversed animals to experimentally induce a rapid transition from genotypic to temperature-dependent sex determination. Controlled mating of normal males to sex-reversed females produces viable and fertile offspring whose phenotypic sex is determined solely by temperature (temperature-dependent sex determination). The W sex chromosome is eliminated from this lineage in the first generation. The instantaneous creation of a lineage of ZZ temperature-sensitive animals reveals a novel, climate-induced pathway for the rapid transition between genetic and temperature-dependent sex determination, and adds to concern about adaptation to rapid global climate change.","Holleley, Clare E.; O'Meally, Denis; Sarre, Stephen D.; Graves, Jennifer A.

80,211,202.0,"Strong-field physics, an extreme limit of light-matter interaction(1-3), is expanding into the realm of surfaces(4,5) and nanostructures(6-11) from its origin in atomic and molecular science(12-15). The attraction of nanostructures lies in two intimately connected features: local intensity enhancement and sub-wavelength confinement of optical fields. Local intensity enhancement facilitates access to the strong-field regime and has already sparked various applications, whereas spatial localization has the potential to generate strong-field dynamics exclusive to nanostructures. However, the observation of features unattainable in gaseous media is challenged by many-body effects and material damage, which arise under intense illumination of dense systems(16-19). Here, we non-destructively access this regime in the solid state by employing single plasmonic nanotips and few-cycle mid-infrared pulses, making use of the wavelength-dependence of the interaction, that is, the ponderomotive energy. We investigate strong-field photoelectron emission and acceleration from single nanostructures over a broad spectral range, and find kinetic energies of hundreds of electronvolts. We observe the transition to a new regime in strong-field dynamics, in which the electrons escape the nanolocalized field within a fraction of an optical half-cycle. The transition into this regime, characterized by a spatial adiabaticity parameter, would require relativistic electrons in the absence of nanostructures. These results establish new degrees of freedom for the manipulation and control of electron dynamics on femtosecond and attosecond timescales, combining optical near-fields and nanoscopic sources.","Herink, G.; Solli, D.

81,3,53.0,"Thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) is a member of the uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) superfamily of DNA repair enzymes. Owing to its ability to excise thymine when mispaired with guanine, it was proposed to act against the mutability of 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) deamination in mammalian DNA(1). However, TDG was also found to interact with transcription factors(2,3), histone acetyltransferases(4) and de novo DNA methyltransferases(5,6), and it has been associated with DNA demethylation in gene promoters following activation of transcription(7-9), altogether implicating an engagement in gene regulation rather than DNA repair. Here we use a mouse genetic approach to determine the biological function of this multifaceted DNA repair enzyme. We find that, unlike other DNA glycosylases, TDG is essential for embryonic development, and that this phenotype is associated with epigenetic aberrations affecting the expression of developmental genes. Fibroblasts derived from Tdg null embryos (mouse embryonic fibroblasts, MEFs) show impaired gene regulation, coincident with imbalanced histone modification and CpG methylation at promoters of affected genes. TDG associates with the promoters of such genes both in fibroblasts and in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), but epigenetic aberrations only appear upon cell lineage commitment. We show that TDG contributes to the maintenance of active and bivalent chromatin throughout cell differentiation, facilitating a proper assembly of chromatin-modifying complexes and initiating base excision repair to counter aberrant de novo methylation. We thus conclude that TDG-dependent DNA repair has evolved to provide epigenetic stability in lineage committed cells.","Cortazar, Daniel; Kunz, Christophe; Selfridge, Jim; Lettieri, Teresa; Saito, Yusuke; MacDougall, Eilidh; Wirz, Annika; Schuermann, David; Jacobs, Angelika L.; Siegrist, Fredy; Steinacher, Roland; Jiricny, Josef; Bird, Adrian; Schaer, Primo","Cortazar, D; Kunz, C; Selfridge, J; Lettieri, T; Saito, Y; MacDougall, E; Wirz, A; Schuermann, D; Jacobs, AL; Siegrist, F; Steinacher, R; Jiricny, J; Bird, A; Schar, P",419.0,"[Cortazar, Daniel; Kunz, Christophe; Saito, Yusuke; Wirz, Annika; Schuermann, David; Jacobs, Angelika L.; Steinacher, Roland; Schaer, Primo] Univ Basel, Inst Biochem & Genet, Dept Biomed, CH-4048 Basel, Switzerland; [Selfridge, Jim; MacDougall, Eilidh; Bird, Adrian] Univ Edinburgh, Wellcome Trust Ctr Cell Biol, Edinburgh EH9 3JR, Midlothian, Scotland; [Lettieri, Teresa; Jiricny, Josef] Univ Zurich, Inst Mol Canc Res, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Siegrist, Fredy] F Hoffmann La Roche Ltd, Global Preclin Safety, Pharmaceut Res, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09672,Article,,primo.schaer@unibas.ch,U210,"Swiss National Science Foundation [3100A0-108436, 3100A0-122574/]; Association For International Cancer Research [01-330]","We thank D.

82,95,154.0,"Ice flow along land-terminating margins of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) varies considerably in response to fluctuating inputs of surface meltwater to the bed of the ice sheet. Such inputs lubricate the ice-bed interface, transiently speeding up the flow of ice(1,2). Greater melting results in faster ice motion during summer, but slower motion over the subsequent winter, owing to the evolution of an efficient drainage system that enables water to drain from regions of the ice-sheet bed that have a high basal water pressure(2,3). However, the impact of hydrodynamic coupling on ice motion over decadal timescales remains poorly constrained. Here we show that annual ice motion across an 8,000-km(2) land-terminating region of the west GIS margin, extending to 1,100 m above sea level, was 12% slower in 2007-14 compared with 198594, despite a 50% increase in surface meltwater production. Our findings suggest that, over these three decades, hydrodynamic coupling in this section of the ablation zone resulted in a net slow-down of ice motion (not a speed-up, as previously postulated(1)). Increases in meltwater production from projected climate warming may therefore further reduce the motion of land-terminating margins of the GIS. Our findings suggest that these sectors of the ice sheet are more resilient to the dynamic impacts of enhanced meltwater production than previously thought.","Tedstone, Andrew J.; Nienow, Peter W.; Gourmelen, Noel; Dehecq, Amaury; Goldberg, Daniel; Hanna, Edward","Tedstone, AJ; Nienow, PW; Gourmelen, N; Dehecq, A; Goldberg, D; Hanna, E",692.0,"[Tedstone, Andrew J.; Nienow, Peter W.; Gourmelen, Noel; Dehecq, Amaury; Goldberg, Daniel] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH8 9XP, Midlothian, Scotland; [Dehecq, Amaury] Univ Savoie Mt Blanc, Polytech Annecy Chambery, LISTIC, F-74944 Annecy Le Vieux, France; [Hanna, Edward] Univ Sheffield, Dept Geog, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15722,Article,1476-4687,a.j.tedstone@ed.ac.uk,695,"UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/152830X/1, NE/J500021/1]; Scottish Alliance for Geoscience, Environment and Society (SAGES) Postdoctoral/Early Career Researcher Exchange (PECRE) award; University of Edinburgh GeoSciences Moss scholarship; European Space Agency Dragon 3 [10302]; Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales","A.J.T. acknowledges UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) studentships NE/152830X/1 and NE/J500021/1, a Scottish Alliance for Geoscience, Environment and Society (SAGES) Postdoctoral/Early Career Researcher Exchange (PECRE) award, and a University of Edinburgh GeoSciences Moss scholarship.

83,149,195.0,"Gut commensal microbes shape the mucosal immune system by regulating the differentiation and expansion of several types of T cell(1-5). Clostridia, a dominant class of commensal microbe, can induce colonic regulatory T (T-reg) cells, which have a central role in the suppression of inflammatory and allergic responses(3). However, the molecular mechanisms by which commensal microbes induce colonic T-reg cells have been unclear. Here we show that a large bowel microbial fermentation product, butyrate, induces the differentiation of colonic T-reg cells in mice. A comparative NMR-based metabolome analysis suggests that the luminal concentrations of short-chain fatty acids positively correlates with the number of T-reg cells in the colon. Among short-chain fatty acids, butyrate induced the differentiation of T-reg cells in vitro and in vivo, and ameliorated the development of colitis induced by adoptive transfer of CD4(+) CD45RB(hi) T cells in Rag1(-/-) mice. Treatment of naive T cells under the T-reg-cell-polarizing conditions with butyrate enhanced histone H3 acetylation in the promoter and conserved non-coding sequence regions of the Foxp3 locus, suggesting a possible mechanism for how microbial-derived butyrate regulates the differentiation of T-reg cells. Our findings provide new insight into the mechanisms by which host-microbe interactions establish immunological homeostasis in the gut.","Furusawa, Yukihiro; Obata, Yuuki; Fukuda, Shinji; Endo, Takaho A.; Nakato, Gaku; Takahashi, Daisuke; Nakanishi, Yumiko; Uetake, Chikako; Kato, Keiko; Kato, Tamotsu; Takahashi, Masumi; Fukuda, Noriko N.; Murakami, Shinnosuke; Miyauchi, Eiji; Hino, Shingo; Atarashi, Koji; Onawa, Satoshi; Fujimura, Yumiko; Lockett, Trevor; Clarke, Julie M.; Topping, David L.; Tomita, Masaru; Hori, Shohei; Ohara, Osamu; Morita, Tatsuya; Koseki, Haruhiko; Kikuchi, Jun; Honda, Kenya; Hase, Koji; Ohno, Hiroshi","Furusawa, Y; Obata, Y; Fukuda, S; Endo, TA; Nakato, G; Takahashi, D; Nakanishi, Y; Uetake, C; Kato, K; Kato, T; Takahashi, M; Fukuda, NN; Murakami, S; Miyauchi, E; Hino, S; Atarashi, K; Onawa, S; Fujimura, Y; Lockett, T; Clarke, JM; Topping, DL; Tomita, M; Hori, S; Ohara, O; Morita, T; Koseki, H; Kikuchi, J; Honda, K; Hase, K; Ohno, H",446.0,"[Furusawa, Yukihiro; Obata, Yuuki; Fukuda, Shinji; Endo, Takaho A.; Nakato, Gaku; Takahashi, Daisuke; Uetake, Chikako; Kato, Keiko; Kato, Tamotsu; Takahashi, Masumi; Miyauchi, Eiji; Atarashi, Koji; Onawa, Satoshi; Hori, Shohei; Ohara, Osamu; Koseki, Haruhiko; Honda, Kenya; Hase, Koji; Ohno, Hiroshi] RIKEN Ctr Integrat Med Sci IMS RCAI, Wako, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Furusawa, Yukihiro; Obata, Yuuki; Fujimura, Yumiko; Hase, Koji] Univ Tokyo, Inst Med Sci, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; [Obata, Yuuki; Koseki, Haruhiko; Ohno, Hiroshi] Chiba Univ, Grad Sch Med, Chiba 2608670, Japan; [Fukuda, Shinji; Nakanishi, Yumiko; Fukuda, Noriko N.; Murakami, Shinnosuke; Tomita, Masaru] Keio Univ, Inst Adv Biosci, Yamagata 9970052, Japan; [Kato, Keiko; Koseki, Haruhiko; Kikuchi, Jun] Yokohama City Univ, Grad Sch Med Life Sci, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Hino, Shingo] Shizuoka Univ, Fac Agr, Shizuoka 4228529, Japan; [Atarashi, Koji; Hase, Koji] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, PRESTO, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; [Lockett, Trevor; Clarke, Julie M.; Topping, David L.] CSIRO Food & Nutr Sci, Preventat Hlth Natl Res Flagship, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia; [Kikuchi, Jun] RIKEN Ctr Sustainable Resource Sci, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Honda, Kenya] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, CREST, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12721,Article,1476-4687,sfukuda@sfc.keio.ac.jp; hase@ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp; ohno@rcai.riken.jp,+,"Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology [24117524, 21022049, 20113003]; The Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [24890293, 252667, 24380072, 24658129, 22689017, 21390155]; The Japan Science and Technology Agency; RIKEN; RIKEN RCAI Young Chief Investigator program; Institute for Fermentation, Osaka; Mishima Kaiun Memorial Foundation; The Takeda Science Foundation; The Mitsubishi Foundation; The Uehara Memorial Foundation","We would like to thank P.

84,67,272.0,"Both genome content and deployment contribute to phenotypic differences between species(1-5). Sex is the most important difference between individuals in a species and has long been posited to be rapidly evolving. Indeed, in the Drosophila genus, traits such as sperm length, genitalia, and gonad size are the most obvious differences between species(6). Comparative analysis of sex-biased expression should deepen our understanding of the relationship between genome content and deployment during evolution. Using existing(7,8) and newly assembled genomes(9), we designed species-specific microarrays to examine sex-biased expression of orthologues and species-restricted genes in D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D. yakuba, D. ananassae, D. pseudoobscura, D. virilis and D. mojavensis. We show that averaged sex-biased expression changes accumulate monotonically over time within the genus. However, different genes contribute to expression variance within species groups compared to between groups. We observed greater turnover of species-restricted genes with male-biased expression, indicating that gene formation and extinction may play a significant part in species differences. Genes with male-biased expression also show the greatest expression and DNA sequence divergence. This higher divergence and turnover of genes with male-biased expression may be due to high transcription rates in the male germline, greater functional pleiotropy of genes expressed in females, and/or sexual competition.","Zhang, Yu; Sturgill, David; Parisi, Michael; Kumar, Sudhir; Oliver, Brian","Zhang, Y; Sturgill, D; Parisi, M; Kumar, S; Oliver, B",233.0,"NIDDKD, Cellular & Dev Biol Lab, NIH, US Dept HHS, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; Arizona State Univ, Ctr Evolutionary Funct Genom, Biodesign Inst, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06323,Article,,yuzhang@mail.nih.gov; oliver@helix.nih.gov,U2,"Intramural NIH HHS [Z01 DK015600-12]; NHGRI NIH HHS [R01 HG002516, R01 HG002516-04A1]",,228RC,,,RNA-POLYMERASE-II; EVOLUTIONARY SIGNIFICANCE; MELANOGASTER; MUTATION; GENOME; RATES; ACCUMULATION; DIVERGENCE; SELECTION; PROFILES,7167.0,NATURE,Nature,English,39.0,No,"Kumar, Sudhir/0000-0002-9918-8212","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",8-Nov,6.0,LONDON,17994089.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007.0,"Kumar, Sudhir/F-1411-2011","Zhang, Y (reprint author), NIDDKD, Cellular & Dev Biol Lab, NIH, US Dept HHS, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,168.0,Constraint and turnover in sex-biased gene expression in the genus Drosophila,2.0,38.0,WOS:000250746200044,272.0,450,Multidisciplinary Sciences,169,brian,oliver,9109.0,4600,male,1.0,gg3UPR8AAAAJ,3,"(4126, 9345]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
85,33,307.0,"Many peptides, when released as chemical messengers within the brain, have powerful influences on complex behaviours. Most strikingly, vasopressin and oxytocin, once thought of as circulating hormones whose actions were confined to peripheral organs, are now known to be released in the brain, where they have fundamentally important roles in social behaviours(1). In humans, disruptions of these peptide systems have been linked to several neurobehavioural disorders, including Prader-Willi syndrome, affective disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder, and polymorphisms of V1a vasopressin receptor have been linked to autism(2,3). Here we report that the rat olfactory bulb contains a large population of interneurons which express vasopressin, that blocking the actions of vasopressin in the olfactory bulb impairs the social recognition abilities of rats and that vasopressin agonists and antagonists can modulate the processing of information by olfactory bulb neurons. The findings indicate that social information is processed in part by a vasopressin system intrinsic to the olfactory system.","Tobin, Vicky A.; Hashimoto, Hirofumi; Wacker, Douglas W.; Takayanagi, Yuki; Langnaese, Kristina; Caquineau, Celine; Noack, Julia; Landgraf, Rainer; Onaka, Tatsushi; Leng, Gareth; Meddle, Simone L.; Engelmann, Mario; Ludwig, Mike","Tobin, VA; Hashimoto, H; Wacker, DW; Takayanagi, Y; Langnaese, K; Caquineau, C; Noack, J; Landgraf, R; Onaka, T; Leng, G; Meddle, SL; Engelmann, M; Ludwig, M",413.0,"[Tobin, Vicky A.; Hashimoto, Hirofumi; Wacker, Douglas W.; Caquineau, Celine; Leng, Gareth; Meddle, Simone L.; Ludwig, Mike] Univ Edinburgh, Ctr Integrat Physiol, Edinburgh EH8 9XD, Midlothian, Scotland; [Takayanagi, Yuki; Onaka, Tatsushi] Jichi Med Univ, Dept Physiol, Shimotsuke, Tochigi 3290498, Japan; [Langnaese, Kristina; Noack, Julia; Engelmann, Mario] Otto VonGuericke Univ Magdegurg, Inst Biochem & Cell Biol, D-39120 Magdeburg, Germany; [Noack, Julia] Otto VonGuericke Univ Magdegurg, Ctr Cellular Imaging & Innovat Dis Models, D-39120 Magdeburg, Germany; [Landgraf, Rainer] Max Planck Inst Psychiat, D-80804 Munich, Germany; [Meddle, Simone L.] Univ Edinburgh, Roslin Inst, Roslin EH25 9PS, Midlothian, Scotland; [Meddle, Simone L.] Univ Edinburgh, Royal Dick Sch Vet Studies, Roslin EH25 9PS, Midlothian, Scotland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08826,Article,,mike.ludwig@ed.ac.uk,U110,"Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council; Japan Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; German Academic Exchange Service/Academic Research Collaboration; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","We thank V.

86,43,268.0,"The ability to manipulate nanoscopic matter precisely is critical for the development of active nanosystems. Optical tweezers(1-4) are excellent tools for transporting particles ranging in size fromseveral micrometres to a few hundred nanometres. Manipulation of dielectric objects with much smaller diameters, however, requires stronger optical confinement and higher intensities than can be provided by these diffraction- limited(5) systems. Here we present an approach to optofluidic transport that overcomes these limitations, using sub-wavelength liquid- core slot waveguides(6). The technique simultaneously makes use of near- field optical forces to confine matter inside the waveguide and scattering/ adsorption forces to transport it. The ability of the slot waveguide to condense the accessible electromagnetic energy to scales as small as 60 nm allows us also to overcome the fundamental diffraction problem. We apply the approach here to the trapping and transport of 75- nm dielectric nanoparticles and lambda-DNA molecules. Because trapping occurs along a line, rather than at a point as with traditional point traps(7,8), the method provides the ability to handle extended biomolecules directly. We also carry out a detailed numerical analysis that relates the near- field optical forces to release kinetics. We believe that the architecture demonstrated here will help to bridge the gap between optical manipulation and nanofluidics.","Yang, Allen H.

87,177,13.0,"Upon environmental changes or extracellular signals, cells are subjected to marked changes in gene expression (1,2). Dealing with high levels of transcription during replication is critical to prevent collisions between the transcription and replication pathways and avoid recombination events(3-5). In response to osmostress, hundreds of stress-responsive genes are rapidly induced by the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) Hog1 (ref.6), even during S phase(7). Here we show in Saccharomyces cerevisae that a single signalling molecule, Hog1, coordinates both replication and transcription upon osmostress. Hog1 interacts with and phosphorylates Mrc1, a component of the replication complex(8-11). Phosphorylation occurs at different sites to those targeted by Mec1 upon DNA damage(8,9). Mrc1 phosphorylation by Hog1 delays early and late origin firing by preventing Cdc45 loading, as well as slowing down replication-complex progression. Regulation of Mrc1 by Hog1 is completely independent of Mec1 and Rad53. Cells carrying a non-phosphorylatable allele of MRC1 (mrc1(3A)) do not delay replication upon stress and show a marked increase in transcription-associated recombination, genomic instability and Rad52 foci. In contrast, mrc1(3A) induces Rad53 and survival in the presence of hydroxyurea or methyl methanesulphonate. Therefore, Hog1 and Mrc1 define a novel S-phase checkpoint independent of the DNA-damage checkpoint that permits eukaryotic cells to prevent conflicts between DNA replication and transcription, which would otherwise lead to genomic instability when both phenomena are temporally coincident.","Duch, Alba; Felipe-Abrio, Irene; Barroso, Sonia; Yaakov, Gilad; Garcia-Rubio, Maria; Aguilera, Andres; de Nadal, Eulalia; Posas, Francesc","Duch, A; Felipe-Abrio, I; Barroso, S; Yaakov, G; Garcia-Rubio, M; Aguilera, A; de Nadal, E; Posas, F",116.0,"[Duch, Alba; Yaakov, Gilad; de Nadal, Eulalia; Posas, Francesc] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Cell Signaling Unit, Dept Ciencies Expt & Salut, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain; [Felipe-Abrio, Irene; Barroso, Sonia; Garcia-Rubio, Maria; Aguilera, Andres] Univ Seville, Ctr Andaluz Biol Mol & Med Regenerat CABIMER, Seville 41092, Spain",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11675,Article,,francesc.posas@upf.edu,+,"Spanish Government [BIO2009-07762, BFU2012-33503, BFU2011-26722, BFU2010-16372, CSD2007-0015]; FP7 UNICELLSYS grant [201142]; Fundacion Marcelino Botin; ICREA Academia (Generalitat de Catalunya)","We thank L.

However, the factors that activate the zygotic program in vertebrates are unknown. Here we show that Nanog, Pou5f1 (also called Oct4) and SoxB1 regulate zygotic gene activation in zebrafish. We identified several hundred genes directly activated by maternal factors, constituting the first wave of zygotic transcription. Ribosome profiling revealed that nanog, sox19b and pou5f1 are the most highly translated transcription factors pre-MZT. Combined loss of these factors resulted in developmental arrest before gastrulation and a failure to activate >75% of zygotic genes, including miR-430. Our results demonstrate that maternal Nanog, Pou5f1 and SoxB1 are required to initiate the zygotic developmental program and induce clearance of the maternal program by activating miR-430 expression.","Lee, Miler T.; Bonneau, Ashley R.; Takacs, Carter M.; Bazzini, Ariel A.; DiVito, Kate R.; Fleming, Elizabeth S.; Giraldez, Antonio J.","Lee, MT; Bonneau, AR; Takacs, CM; Bazzini, AA; DiVito, KR; Fleming, ES; Giraldez, AJ",360.0,"[Lee, Miler T.; Bonneau, Ashley R.; Takacs, Carter M.; Bazzini, Ariel A.; DiVito, Kate R.; Fleming, Elizabeth S.; Giraldez, Antonio J.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Giraldez, Antonio J.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Yale Stem Cell Ctr, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12632,Article,1476-4687,antonio.giraldez@yale.edu,+,"NIH [F32HD071697-02, T32GM007499, F32HD061194-03]; Pew Fellows Program in Biomedical Sciences; Pew Scholars Program in the Biomedical Sciences; Yale Scholars Program;  [R01GM081602-06];  [R01GM103789-01];  [R01HD074078-02]","We thank Y.

89,131,350.0,"The silkworm Bombyx mori uses a WZ sex determination system that is analogous to the one found in birds and some reptiles. In this system, males have two Z sex chromosomes, whereas females have Z and W sex chromosomes. The silkworm W chromosome has a dominant role in female determination(1,2), suggesting the existence of a dominant feminizing gene in this chromosome. However, the W chromosomeis almost fully occupied by transposable element sequences(3-5), and no functional protein-coding gene has been identified so far. Female-enriched PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are the only known transcripts that are produced from the sex-determining region of the W chromosome(6), but the function(s) of these piRNAs are unknown. Here we show that a W-chromosome-derived, female-specific piRNA is the feminizing factor of B. mori. This piRNA is produced from a piRNA precursor which we named Fem. Fem sequences were arranged in tandem in the sex-determining region of the W chromosome. Inhibition of Fem-derived piRNA-mediated signalling in female embryos led to the production of the male-specific splice variants of B. mori doublesex (Bmdsx), a gene which acts at the downstream end of the sex differentiation cascade(7,8). A target gene of Fem-derived piRNA was identified on the Z chromosome of B. mori. This gene, which we named Masc, encoded a CCCH-type zinc finger protein. We show that the silencing of Masc messenger RNA by Fem piRNA is required for the production of female-specific isoforms of Bmdsx in female embryos, and that Masc protein controls both dosage compensation and masculinization in male embryos. Our study characterizes a single small RNA that is responsible for primary sex determination in the WZ sex determination system.","Kiuchi, Takashi; Koga, Hikaru; Kawamoto, Munetaka; Shoji, Keisuke; Sakai, Hiroki; Arai, Yuji; Ishihara, Genki; Kawaoka, Shinpei; Sugano, Sumio; Shimada, Toru; Suzuki, Yutaka; Suzuki, Masataka G.; Katsuma, Susumu","Kiuchi, T; Koga, H; Kawamoto, M; Shoji, K; Sakai, H; Arai, Y; Ishihara, G; Kawaoka, S; Sugano, S; Shimada, T; Suzuki, Y; Suzuki, MG; Katsuma, S",633.0,"[Kiuchi, Takashi; Koga, Hikaru; Kawamoto, Munetaka; Shoji, Keisuke; Arai, Yuji; Ishihara, Genki; Kawaoka, Shinpei; Shimada, Toru; Katsuma, Susumu] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Dept Agr & Environm Biol, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138657, Japan; [Sakai, Hiroki; Suzuki, Masataka G.] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Dept Integrated Biosci, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778562, Japan; [Sugano, Sumio; Suzuki, Yutaka] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Dept Med Genome Sci, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088639, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13315,Article,1476-4687,katsuma@ss.ab.a.u-tokyo.ac.jp,+,Program for Promotion of Basic and Applied Researches for Innovations in Bio-oriented Industry;  [22115502];  [22128004],We thank S.

90,210,197.0,"Catabolism may give rise to toxic intermediates that compromise cell vitality, such as epoxide formation in the recently elucidated and apparently universal bacterial coenzyme A (CoA)-dependent degradation of phenylacetic acid(1). This compound is central to the catabolism of a variety of aromatics, such as phenylalanine, lignin-related compounds or environmental contaminants(2,3). The key phenylacetyl-CoA monooxygenase (epoxidase) of the pathway, PaaABCE(1,4,5), is also connected to the production of various primary and secondary metabolites(6-9), as well as to the virulence of certain pathogens(1,10,11). However, the enzyme complex has so far not been investigated in detail. Here we characterize the bacterial multicomponent monooxygenase PaaABCE that, surprisingly, not only transforms phenylacetyl-CoA into its ring-1,2-epoxide, but also mediates the NADPH-dependent removal of the epoxide oxygen, regenerating phenylacetyl-CoA with formation of water. We provide evidence for a catalytic di-iron centre that is probably the key to the unprecedented deoxygenation of an organic compound by an oxygenase. Presumably, the bifunctionality is vital to avoid toxic intracellular epoxide levels if the subsequent catabolic steps are impeded. Our data suggest that detoxification is assisted by two thioesterases (PaaI and PaaY) forming non-reactive breakdown products. Hence, PaaABCE may harbour an intrinsic escape mechanism from its own toxic product and represents the archetype of a bifunctional oxygenase/deoxygenase. Analogous reactions may possibly be catalysed by other di-iron epoxidases.","Teufel, Robin; Friedrich, Thorsten; Fuchs, Georg","Teufel, R; Friedrich, T; Fuchs, G",359.0,"[Teufel, Robin; Fuchs, Georg] Univ Freiburg, Fak Biol, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Friedrich, Thorsten] Univ Freiburg, Fak Chem, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10862,Article,,georg.fuchs@biologie.uni-freiburg.de,U161,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft,"We thank Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft for support; V.

91,239,454.0,"In winter, northeastern North America and northeastern Asia are both colder than other regions at similar latitudes. This has been attributed to the effects of stationary weather systems set by elevated terrain (orography)(1), and to a lack of maritime influences from the prevailing westerly winds(2). However, the differences in extent and orography between the two continents suggest that further mechanisms are involved. Here we show that this anomalous winter cold can result in part from westward radiation of large-scale atmospheric waves-nearly stationary Rossby waves-generated by heating of the atmosphere over warm ocean waters. We demonstrate this mechanism using simulations with an idealized general circulation model(3-5), with which we show that the extent of the cold region is controlled by properties of Rossby waves, such as their group velocity and its dependence on the planetary rotation rate. Our results show that warm ocean waters contribute to the contrast in mid-latitude winter temperatures between eastern and western continental boundaries not only by warming western boundaries, but also by cooling eastern boundaries.","Kaspi, Yohai; Schneider, Tapio","Kaspi, Y; Schneider, T",621.0,"[Kaspi, Yohai; Schneider, Tapio] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09924,Article,,yohai@alum.mit.edu,+,National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate and Global Change; David and Lucile Packard Fellowship; National Science Foundation [AGS-1019211],"We thank D.

92,77,159.0,"Understanding the transmission of sensory information at individual synaptic connections requires knowledge of the properties of presynaptic terminals and their patterns of firing evoked by sensory stimuli. Such information has been difficult to obtain because of the small size and inaccessibility of nerve terminals in the central nervous system. Here we show, by making direct patch- clamp recordings in vivo from cerebellar mossy fibre boutons - the primary source of synaptic input to the cerebellar cortex(1,2) - that sensory stimulation can produce bursts of spikes in single boutons at very high instantaneous firing frequencies ( more than 700 Hz). We show that the mossy fibre - granule cell synapse exhibits high- fidelity transmission at these frequencies, indicating that the rapid burst of excitatory postsynaptic currents underlying the sensory- evoked response of granule cells(3) can be driven by such a presynaptic spike burst. We also demonstrate that a single mossy fibre can trigger action potential bursts in granule cells in vitro when driven with in vivo firing patterns. These findings suggest that the relay from mossy fibre to granule cell can act in a 'detonator' fashion, such that a single presynaptic afferent may be sufficient to transmit the sensory message. This endows the cerebellar mossy fibre system with remarkable sensitivity and high fidelity in the transmission of sensory information.","Rancz, Ede A.; Ishikawa, Taro; Duguid, Ian; Chadderton, Paul; Mahon, Severine; Haeusser, Michael","Rancz, EA; Ishikawa, T; Duguid, I; Chadderton, P; Mahon, S; Hausser, M",1245.0,"UCL, Wolfson Inst Biomed Res, London WC1E 6BT, England; UCL, Dept Physiol, London WC1E 6BT, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature05995,Article,,m.hausser@ucl.ac.uk,U12,"Wellcome Trust [, 068699]",,243HA,,,GRANULE CELL LAYER; IN-VIVO; PURKINJE-CELLS; RAT; RESPONSES; SYNAPSE; CORTEX; BRAIN; INTEGRATION; MORPHOLOGY,7173.0,NATURE,Nature,English,33.0,No,"Rancz, Ede Attila/0000-0002-7951-1385; Chadderton, Paul/0000-0002-6276-1011","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",20-Dec,5.0,LONDON,18097412.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007.0,"Mahon, Severine/E-7195-2017","Hausser, M (reprint author), UCL, Wolfson Inst Biomed Res, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,153.0,High-fidelity transmission of sensory information by single cerebellar mossy fibre boutons,1.0,11.0,WOS:000251786200053,159.0,450,Multidisciplinary Sciences,154,michael,haeusser,14605.0,11094,male,1.0,yhMNQoQAAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
93,183,31.0,"Gene transcription by RNA polymerase (Pol) II requires the coactivator complex Mediator. Mediator connects transcriptional regulators and Pol II, and is linked to human disease(1-4). Mediator from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has a molecular mass of 1.4 megadaltons and comprises 25 subunits that form the head, middle, tail and kinase modules(5-7). The head module constitutes one-half of the essential Mediator core(8), and comprises the conserved(9) subunits Med6, Med8, Med11, Med17, Med18, Med20 and Med22. Recent X-ray analysis of the S. cerevisiae head module at 4.3 angstrom resolution led to a partial architectural model with three submodules called neck, fixed jaw and moveable jaw(10). Here we determine de novo the crystal structure of the head module from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe at 3.4 angstrom resolution. Structure solution was enabled by new structures of Med6 and the fixed jaw, and previous structures of the moveable jaw(11) and part of the neck(12), and required deletion of Med20. The S. pombe head module resembles the head of a crocodile with eight distinct elements, of which at least four are mobile. The fixed jaw comprises tooth and nose domains, whereas the neck submodule contains a helical spine and one limb, with shoulder, arm and finger elements. The arm and the essential shoulder contact other parts of Mediator. The jaws and a central joint are implicated in interactions with Pol II and its carboxy-terminal domain, and the joint is required for transcription in vitro. The S. pombe head module structure leads to a revised model of the S. cerevisiae module, reveals a high conservation and flexibility, explains knownmutations, and provides the basis for unravelling a central mechanism of gene regulation.","Lariviere, Laurent; Plaschka, Clemens; Seizl, Martin; Wenzeck, Larissa; Kurth, Fabian; Cramer, Patrick","Lariviere, L; Plaschka, C; Seizl, M; Wenzeck, L; Kurth, F; Cramer, P",448.0,"[Lariviere, Laurent; Plaschka, Clemens; Seizl, Martin; Wenzeck, Larissa; Kurth, Fabian; Cramer, Patrick] Univ Munich, Gene Ctr, D-81377 Munich, Germany; [Lariviere, Laurent; Plaschka, Clemens; Seizl, Martin; Wenzeck, Larissa; Kurth, Fabian; Cramer, Patrick] Univ Munich, CIPSM, Dept Biochem, D-81377 Munich, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11670,Article,,larivier@genzentrum.lmu.de; cramer@genzentrum.lmu.de,+,"Boehringer Ingelheim fellowship; Elite Network of Bavaria; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB646, TR5, GraKo1721, SFB960]; CIPSM; NIM; European Research Council; LMU innovativ project Bioimaging Network; Vallee Foundation; Jung-Stiftung","We thank S.

94,211,437.0,"Two types of supernova are thought to produce the overwhelming majority of neutron stars in the Universe(1). The first type, iron-core-collapse supernovae, occurs when a high-mass star develops a degenerate iron core that exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit(2). The second type, electron-capture supernovae, is associated with the collapse of a lower-mass oxygen-neon-magnesium core as it loses pressure support owing to the sudden capture of electrons by neon and/or magnesium nuclei(3,4). It has hitherto been impossible to identify the two distinct families of neutron stars produced in these formation channels. Here we report that a large, well-known class of neutron-star-hosting X-ray pulsars is actually composed of two distinct subpopulations with different characteristic spin periods, orbital periods and orbital eccentricities. This class, the Be/X-ray binaries, contains neutron stars that accrete material from a more massive companion star(5). The two subpopulations are most probably associated with the two distinct types of neutron-star-forming supernova, with electron-capture supernovae preferentially producing systems with short spin periods, short orbital periods and low eccentricities. Intriguingly, the split between the two subpopulations is clearest in the distribution of the logarithm of spin period, a result that had not been predicted and which still remains to be explained.","Knigge, Christian; Coe, Malcolm J.; Podsiadlowski, Philipp","Knigge, C; Coe, MJ; Podsiadlowski, P",372.0,"[Knigge, Christian; Coe, Malcolm J.] Univ Southampton, Sch Phys & Astron, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Podsiadlowski, Philipp] Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Oxford OX1 3RH, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10529,Article,,c.knigge@soton.ac.uk,375,UK Science and Technology Facilities Council,Research support for this project was provided by the UK Science and Technology Facilities Council.

95,5,93.0,"Fluctuations in surface melting are known to affect the speed of glaciers and ice sheets(1-7), but their impact on the Greenland ice sheet in a warming climate remains uncertain(8). Although some studies suggest that greater melting produces greater ice-sheet acceleration(7,9), others have identified a long-term decrease in Greenland's flow despite increased melting(3). Here we use satellite observations of ice motion recorded in a land-terminating sector of southwest Greenland to investigate the manner in which ice flow develops during years of markedly different melting. Although peak rates of ice speed-up are positively correlated with the degree of melting, mean summer flow rates are not, because glacier slowdown occurs, on average, when a critical run-off threshold of about 1.4 centimetres a day is exceeded. In contrast to the first half of summer, when flow is similar in all years, speed-up during the latter half is 62 +/- 16 per cent less in warmer years. Consequently, in warmer years, the period of fast ice flow is three times shorter and, overall, summer ice flow is slower. This behaviour is at odds with that expected from basal lubrication alone(7,9). Instead, it mirrors that of mountain glaciers(10-12), where melt-induced acceleration of flow ceases during years of high melting once subglacial drainage becomes efficient. A model of ice-sheet flow that captures switching between cavity and channel drainage modes(13) is consistent with the run-off threshold, fast-flow periods, and later-summer speeds we have observed. Simulations of the Greenland ice-sheet flow under climate warming scenarios should account for the dynamic evolution of subglacial drainage; a simple model of basal lubrication alone misses key aspects of the ice sheet's response to climate warming.","Sundal, Aud Venke; Shepherd, Andrew; Nienow, Peter; Hanna, Edward; Palmer, Steven; Huybrechts, Philippe","Sundal, AV; Shepherd, A; Nienow, P; Hanna, E; Palmer, S; Huybrechts, P",522.0,"[Sundal, Aud Venke; Shepherd, Andrew; Palmer, Steven] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Nienow, Peter] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH8 9XP, Midlothian, Scotland; [Hanna, Edward] Univ Sheffield, Dept Geog, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Huybrechts, Philippe] Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Geog, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09740,Article,,a.shepherd@leeds.ac.uk,U83,UK NERC National Centre for Earth Observation; EU [026],"This work was supported by the UK NERC National Centre for Earth Observation, a Philip Leverhulme Prize to A.S. and by the EU FP7 Ice2Sea project (publ. no. 026).

97,110,24.0,"Magnetohydrodynamic turbulence is important in many high-energy astrophysical systems, where instabilities can amplify the local magnetic field over very short timescales(1,2). Specifically, the magnetorotational instability and dynamo action(3-6) have been suggested as a mechanism for the growth of magnetar-strength magnetic fields (of 10(15) gauss and above) and for powering the explosion(7-10) of a rotating massive star(11,12). Such stars are candidate progenitors of type Ic-bl hypernovae(13,14), which make up all supernovae that are connected to long gamma-ray bursts(15,16). The magnetorotational instability has been studied with local high-resolution shearing-box simulations in three dimensions(17-19), and with global two-dimensional simulations(20), but it is not known whether turbulence driven by this instability can result in the creation of a large-scale, ordered and dynamically relevant field. Here we report results from global, three-dimensional, general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic turbulence simulations. We show that hydromagnetic turbulence in rapidly rotating protoneutron stars produces an inverse cascade of energy. We find a large-scale, ordered toroidal field that is consistent with the formation of bipolar magnetorotationally driven outflows. Our results demonstrate that rapidly rotating massive stars are plausible progenitors for both type Ic-bl supernovae(13,21,22) and long gamma-ray bursts, and provide a viable mechanism for the formation of magnetars(23,24). Moreover, our findings suggest that rapidly rotating massive stars might lie behind potentially magnetar-powered superluminous supernovae(25,26).","Moesta, Philipp; Ott, Christian D.; Radice, David; Roberts, Luke F.; Schnetter, Erik; Haas, Roland","Mosta, P; Ott, CD; Radice, D; Roberts, LF; Schnetter, E; Haas, R",376.0,"[Moesta, Philipp; Ott, Christian D.; Radice, David; Roberts, Luke F.] CALTECH, Walter Burke Inst Theoret Phys, TAPIR, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Moesta, Philipp] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Astron, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Schnetter, Erik] Perimeter Inst Theoret Phys, Waterloo, ON N2L 2Y5, Canada; [Schnetter, Erik] Univ Guelph, Dept Phys, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Schnetter, Erik] Louisiana State Univ, Ctr Computat & Technol, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Haas, Roland] Max Planck Inst Gravitat Phys, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15755,Article,1476-4687,pmoesta@berkeley.edu,+,"National Science Foundation (NSF) [AST-1212170, PHY-1151197, OCI-0905046]; NASA [PF5-160140, PF3-140114]; National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Sherman Fairchild Foundation","We thank S.

98,103,243.0,"A quantum point contact (QPC) is a narrow constriction between two wider electron reservoirs, and is the standard building block of sub-micrometre devices such as quantum dots and qubits ( the proposed basic elements of quantum computers). The conductance through a QPC changes as a function of its width in integer steps of G(0) = 2e(2)/h ( where e is the charge on an electron, and h is Planck's constant), signalling the quantization of its transverse modes(1,2). But measurements of these conductance steps also reveal an additional shoulder at a value around 0.7 G(0) (refs 1 - 4), an observation that has remained a puzzle for more than a decade. It has recently been suggested(5,6) that this phenomenon can be explained by the existence of a magnetic 'impurity' in the QPC at low electron densities. Here we present extensive numerical density-functional calculations that reveal the formation of an electronic state with a spin-1/2 magnetic moment in the channel under very general conditions. In addition, we show that such an impurity will also form at large magnetic fields, for a specific value of the field, and sometimes even at the opening of the second transverse mode in the QPC. Beyond explaining the source of the '0.7 anomaly', these results may have far-reaching implications for spin-filling of electronic states in quantum dots and for the dephasing of quantum information stored in semiconductor qubits.","Rejec, Tomaz; Meir, Yigal","Rejec, T; Meir, Y",900.0,"Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Phys, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Ilse Katz Ctr Meso & Nano Scale Sci & Technol, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature05054,Article,1476-4687,tomaz.rejec@ijs.si,903,,,076LT,,,DIMENSIONAL ELECTRON-GAS; CONDUCTANCE; DOTS,7105.0,NATURE,Nature,English,20.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",24-Aug,4.0,LONDON,16929294.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,,"Rejec, T (reprint author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Phys, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,121.0,Magnetic impurity formation in quantum point contacts,0.0,15.0,WOS:000239960500033,243.0,442,Multidisciplinary Sciences,121,yigal,meir,13407.0,18,male,1.0,Im5qB7oAAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",42831178,1,42831178,1,Yigal Meir,Yigal Meir,1,1
99,128,221.0,"Magma fluxes regulate the planetary thermal budget, the growth of continents and the frequency and magnitude of volcanic eruptions, and play a part in the genesis and size of magmatic ore deposits(1-4). However, because a large fraction of the magma produced on the Earth does not erupt at the surface(2,5), determinations of magma fluxes are rare and this compromises our ability to establish a link between global heat transfer and large-scale geological processes. Here we show that age distributions of zircons, a mineral often present in crustal magmatic rocks(6), in combination with thermal modelling, provide an accurate means of retrieving magma fluxes. The characteristics of zircon age populations vary significantly and systematically as a function of the flux and total volume of magma accumulated in the Earth's crust. Our approach produces results that are consistent with independent determinations of magma fluxes and volumes of magmatic systems. Analysis of existing age population data sets using our method suggests that porphyry-type deposits, plutons and large eruptions each require magma input over different timescales at different characteristic average fluxes. We anticipate that more extensive and complete magma flux data sets will serve to clarify the control that the global heat flux exerts on the frequency of geological events such as volcanic eruptions, and to determine the main factors controlling the distribution of resources on our planet.","Caricchi, Luca; Simpson, Guy; Schaltegger, Urs","Caricchi, L; Simpson, G; Schaltegger, U",457.0,"[Caricchi, Luca; Simpson, Guy; Schaltegger, Urs] Univ Geneva, Sect Earth & Environm Sci, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13532,Article,1476-4687,luca.caricchi@unige.ch,+,University of Geneva; Swiss National Science Foundation,"We thank C.

100,80,224.0,"Morphogens act in developing tissues to control the spatial arrangement of cellular differentiation(1,2). The activity of a morphogen has generally been viewed as a concentration-dependent response to a diffusible signal, but the duration of morphogen signalling can also affect cellular responses(3). One such example is the morphogen sonic hedgehog (SHH). In the vertebrate central nervous system and limbs, the pattern of cellular differentiation is controlled by both the amount and the time of SHH exposure(4-7). How these two parameters are interpreted at a cellular level has been unclear. Here we provide evidence that changing the concentration or duration of SHH has an equivalent effect on intracellular signalling. Chick neural cells convert different concentrations of SHH into time-limited periods of signal transduction, such that signal duration is proportional to SHH concentration. This depends on the gradual desensitization of cells to ongoing SHH exposure, mediated by the SHH-dependent upregulation of patched 1 (PTC1), a ligand-binding inhibitor of SHH signalling(8). Thus, in addition to its role in shaping the SHH gradient(8-10), PTC1 participates cell autonomously in gradient sensing. Together, the data reveal a novel strategy for morphogen interpretation, in which the temporal adaptation of cells to a morphogen integrates the concentration and duration of a signal to control differential gene expression.","Dessaud, Eric; Yang, Lin Lin; Hill, Katy; Cox, Barny; Ulloa, Fausto; Ribeiro, Ana; Mynett, Anita; Novitch, Bennett G.; Briscoe, James","Dessaud, E; Yang, LL; Hill, K; Cox, B; Ulloa, F; Ribeiro, A; Mynett, A; Novitch, BG; Briscoe, J",717.0,"Natl Inst Med Res, London NW7 1AA, England; Univ Michigan, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06347,Article,1476-4687,james.briscoe@nimr.mrc.ac.uk,U7,Medical Research Council [MC_U117560541]; NINDS NIH HHS [R01 NS072804],,235BY,,,PROGENITOR-CELL IDENTITY; VENTRAL NEURAL-TUBE; NEURONAL FATE; FLOOR PLATE; TRANSDUCTION; SPECIFICATION; INDUCTION; GENE; PATHWAY; PATTERN,7170.0,NATURE,Nature,English,33.0,No,"Novitch, Bennett/0000-0002-2696-3708; Dessaud, Eric/0000-0001-9723-6658; Briscoe, James/0000-0002-1020-5240","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",29-Nov,5.0,LONDON,18046410.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007.0,,"Briscoe, J (reprint author), Natl Inst Med Res, Mill Hill, London NW7 1AA, England.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,256.0,Interpretation of the sonic hedgehog morphogen gradient by a temporal adaptation mechanism,0.0,16.0,WOS:000251209700053,224.0,450,Multidisciplinary Sciences,258,james,briscoe,14198.0,6359,male,0.99,VJ83sekAAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",45465524,1,28802773,1,Jim Briscoe,Jim Briscoe,1,1

102,101,201.0,"Fuel cells, as devices for direct conversion of the chemical energy of a fuel into electricity by electrochemical reactions, are among the key enabling technologies for the transition to a hydrogen-based economy(1-3). Of several different types of fuel cells under development today, polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) have been recognized as a potential future power source for zero-emission vehicles(4,5). However, to become commercially viable, PEFCs have to overcome the barrier of high catalyst cost caused by the exclusive use of platinum and platinum-based catalysts(6-8) in the fuel-cell electrodes. Here we demonstrate a new class of low-cost (non-precious metal)/(heteroatomic polymer) nanocomposite catalysts for the PEFC cathode, capable of combining high oxygen-reduction activity with good performance durability. Without any optimization, the cobalt-polypyrrole composite catalyst enables power densities of about 0.15 W cm(-2) in H-2-O-2 fuel cells and displays no signs of performance degradation for more than 100 hours. The results of this study show that heteroatomic polymers can be used not only to stabilize the non-precious metal in the acidic environment of the PEFC cathode but also to generate active sites for oxygen reduction reaction.","Bashyam, Rajesh; Zelenay, Piotr","Bashyam, R; Zelenay, P",63.0,"Los Alamos Natl Lab, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature05118,Article,,zelenay@lanl.gov,66,,,081JM,,,FE-BASED CATALYSTS; OXYGEN REDUCTION; PLATINUM MONOLAYER; O-2 REDUCTION; CARBON-BLACK; ELECTROCATALYSTS; CATHODE; POLYPYRROLE; PROTON; ENERGY,7107.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,"Thandavarayan, Maiyalagan/0000-0003-3528-3824","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",7-Sep,4.0,LONDON,16957726.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,"Thandavarayan, Maiyalagan/C-5716-2011","Zelenay, P (reprint author), Los Alamos Natl Lab, POB 1663, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,1278.0,A class of non-precious metal composite catalysts for fuel cells,82.0,891.0,WOS:000240313900039,201.0,443,Multidisciplinary Sciences,1304,piotr,zelenay,14379.0,176,male,1.0,jxaMcQoAAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
103,163,5.0,"Some evolutionary innovations may originate non-adaptively as exaptations, or pre-adaptations, which are by-products of other adaptive traits(1-5). Examples include feathers, which originated before they were used in flight(2), and lens crystallins, which are light-refracting proteins that originated as enzymes(6). The question of how often adaptive traits have non-adaptive origins has profound implications for evolutionary biology, but is difficult to address systematically. Here we consider this issue in metabolism, one of the most ancient biological systems that is central to all life. We analyse a metabolic trait of great adaptive importance: the ability of a metabolic reaction network to synthesize all biomass from a single source of carbon and energy. We use novel computational methods to sample randomly many metabolic networks that can sustain life on any given carbon source but contain an otherwise random set of known biochemical reactions. We show that when we require such networks to be viable on one particular carbon source, they are typically also viable on multiple other carbon sources that were not targets of selection. For example, viability on glucose may entail viability on up to 44 other sole carbon sources. Any one adaptation in these metabolic systems typically entails multiple potential exaptations.

104,177,333.0,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression that act by direct base pairing to target sites within untranslated regions of messenger RNAs1. Recently, miRNA activity has been shown to be affected by the presence of miRNA sponge transcripts, the so-called competing endogenous RNA in humans and target mimicry in plants(2-7). We previously identified a highly expressed circular RNA (circRNA) in human and mouse brain(8). Here we show that this circRNA acts as a miR-7 sponge; we term this circular transcript ciRS-7 (circular RNA sponge for miR-7). ciRS-7 contains more than 70 selectively conserved miRNA target sites, and it is highly and widely associated with Argonaute (AGO) proteins in a miR-7-dependent manner. Although the circRNA is completely resistant to miRNA-mediated target destabilization, it strongly suppresses miR-7 activity, resulting in increased levels of miR-7 targets. In the mouse brain, we observe overlapping co-expression of ciRS-7 and miR-7, particularly in neocortical and hippocampal neurons, suggesting a high degree of endogenous interaction. We further show that the testis-specific circRNA, sex-determining region Y (Sry)(9), serves as a miR-138 sponge, suggesting that miRNA sponge effects achieved by circRNA formation are a general phenomenon. This study serves as the first, to our knowledge, functional analysis of a naturally expressed circRNA.","Hansen, Thomas B.; Jensen, Trine I.; Clausen, Bettina H.; Bramsen, Jesper B.; Finsen, Bente; Damgaard, Christian K.; Kjems, Jorgen","Hansen, TB; Jensen, TI; Clausen, BH; Bramsen, JB; Finsen, B; Damgaard, CK; Kjems, J",384.0,"[Hansen, Thomas B.; Jensen, Trine I.; Bramsen, Jesper B.; Damgaard, Christian K.; Kjems, Jorgen] Aarhus Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Clausen, Bettina H.; Finsen, Bente] Univ Southern Denmark, Inst Mol Med, DK-5000 Odense C, Denmark; [Bramsen, Jesper B.; Kjems, Jorgen] Aarhus Univ, Interdisciplinary Nanosci Ctr iNANO, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11993,Article,1476-4687,tbh@mb.au.dk; jk@mb.au.dk,388,SIROCCO EU consortium; Lundbeck Foundation; Danish Council for Independent Research - Natural Sciences,"We thank C.

105,104,254.0,"The centrosome organizes the microtubule cytoskeleton and consists of a pair of centrioles surrounded by pericentriolar material. Cells begin the cell cycle with a single centrosome, which duplicates once before mitosis. During duplication, new centrioles grow orthogonally to existing ones and remain engaged ( tightly opposed) with those centrioles until late mitosis or early G1 phase, when they become disengaged(1). The relationship between centriole engagement/disengagement and centriole duplication potential is not understood, and the mechanisms that control these processes are not known. Here we show that centriole disengagement requires the protease separase(2) at anaphase, and that this disengagement licences centriole duplication in the next cell cycle. We describe an in vitro system using Xenopus egg extract and purified centrioles in which both centriole disengagement and centriole growth occur. Centriole disengagement at anaphase is independent of mitotic exit and Cdk2/cyclin E activity, but requires the anaphase-promoting complex and separase. In contrast to disengagement, new centriole growth occurs in interphase, is dependent on Cdk2/cyclin E, and requires previously disengaged centrioles. This suggests that re-duplication of centrioles within a cell cycle is prevented by centriole engagement itself. We propose that the 'once-only' control of centrosome duplication is achieved by temporally separating licensing in anaphase from growth of new centrioles during S phase. The involvement of separase in both centriole disengagement and sister chromatid separation would prevent premature centriole disengagement before anaphase onset, which can lead to multipolar spindles and genomic instability(3,4).","Tsou, Meng-Fu Bryan; Stearns, Tim","Tsou, MFB; Stearns, T",947.0,"Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature04985,Article,,stearns@stanford.edu,951,,,076LT,,,SISTER-CHROMATID SEPARATION; CENTRIOLE; MITOSIS; KINASE; ONCOPROTEIN; INSTABILITY; PROGRESSION; CDK2-CYCLIN; CHROMOSOME; INTERPHASE,7105.0,NATURE,Nature,English,28.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",24-Aug,5.0,LONDON,16862117.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,,"Stearns, T (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,247.0,Mechanism limiting centrosome duplication to once per cell cycle,0.0,15.0,WOS:000239960500044,254.0,442,Multidisciplinary Sciences,249,tim,stearns,13382.0,2949,male,0.99,C1c54H4AAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",52067867,1,52067867,1,Tim Stearns,Tim Stearns,1,1
106,56,76.0,"Natural selection dictates that cells constantly adapt to dynamically changing environments in a context- dependent manner. Gene- regulatory networks often mediate the cellular response to perturbation(1-3), and an understanding of cellular adaptation will require experimental approaches aimed at subjecting cells to a dynamic environment that mimics their natural habitat(4-9). Here we monitor the response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolic gene regulation to periodic changes in the external carbon source by using a microfluidic platform that allows precise, dynamic control over environmental conditions. We show that the metabolic system acts as a low- pass filter that reliably responds to a slowly changing environment, while effectively ignoring fast fluctuations. The sensitive low- frequency response was significantly faster than in predictions arising from our computational modelling, and this discrepancy was resolved by the discovery that two key galactose transcripts possess half- lives that depend on the carbon source. Finally, to explore how induction characteristics affect frequency response, we compare two S. cerevisiae strains and show that they have the same frequency response despite having markedly different induction properties. This suggests that although certain characteristics of the complex networks may differ when probed in a static environment, the system has been optimized for a robust response to a dynamically changing environment.","Bennett, Matthew R.; Pang, Wyming Lee; Ostroff, Natalie A.; Baumgartner, Bridget L.; Nayak, Sujata; Tsimring, Lev S.; Hasty, Jeff","Bennett, MR; Pang, WL; Ostroff, NA; Baumgartner, BL; Nayak, S; Tsimring, LS; Hasty, J",1119.0,"[Bennett, Matthew R.; Pang, Wyming Lee; Ostroff, Natalie A.; Baumgartner, Bridget L.; Nayak, Sujata; Hasty, Jeff] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Bioengn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Bennett, Matthew R.; Tsimring, Lev S.; Hasty, Jeff] Univ Calif San Diego, Inst Nonlinear Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07211,Article,1476-4687,hasty@ucsd.edu,1122,National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health,"We thank A.

The integrity of both forms requires the mRNA cap and poly( A) tail, as well as eIF4E, eIF4G, Pab1 and eIF3, and is dependent on the length of both the mRNA and the poly( A) tail.

108,73,479.0,"The thermal structure of the crust strongly influences deformation, metamorphism and plutonism(1-3). Models for the geothermal gradient in stable crust predict a steady increase of temperature with depth. This thermal structure, however, is incompatible with observations from high- temperature metamorphic terranes exhumed in orogens(1,4,5,6). Global compilations(7) of peak conditions in high- temperature metamorphic terranes define relatively narrow ranges of peak temperatures over a wide range in pressure, for both isothermal decompression and isobaric cooling paths. Here we develop simple one- dimensional thermal models that include the effects of melt migration. These models show that long- lived plutonism results in a quasi- steady- state geotherm with a rapid temperature increase in the upper crust and nearly isothermal conditions in the middle and lower crust. The models also predict that the upward advection of heat by melt generates granulite facies metamorphism, and widespread andalusite - sillimanite metamorphism in the upper crust. Once the quasi- steady- state thermal profile is reached, the middle and lower crust are greatly weakened due to high temperatures and anatectic conditions, thus setting the stage for gravitational collapse(8), exhumation and isothermal decompression after the onset of plutonism. Near- iso-thermal conditions in the middle and lower crust result from the thermal buffering effect of dehydration melting reactions that, in part, control the shape of the geotherm.","Depine, Gabriela V.; Andronicos, Christopher L.; Phipps-Morgan, Jason","Depine, GV; Andronicos, CL; Phipps-Morgan, J",80.0,"[Depine, Gabriela V.; Andronicos, Christopher L.; Phipps-Morgan, Jason] Cornell Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06689,Article,1476-4687,gvd2@cornell.edu,83,,,269SZ,,,THERMAL-PROCESSES; BRITISH-COLUMBIA; OROGENIC BELTS; GRANITE; FLOW; METAMORPHISM; EMPLACEMENT; MOUNTAINS; ANATEXIS; SOLIDUS,7183.0,NATURE,Nature,English,34.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",6-Mar,4.0,LONDON,18322532.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,,"Depine, GV (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Snee Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,34.0,Near-isothermal conditions in the middle and lower crust induced by melt migration,2.0,19.0,WOS:000253671900050,479.0,452,Multidisciplinary Sciences,34,jason,phipps-morgan,9583.0,4927,male,1.0,D2TRutgAAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",45641474,1,673711,1,Morgan (2016 film),Morgan (2016 film),0,0

This focus was elegantly set in motion a decade ago with the design and construction of a genetic toggle switch and an oscillator, with subsequent highlights that have included circuits capable of pattern generation, noise shaping, edge detection and event counting. Here we describe an engineered gene network with global intercellular coupling that is capable of generating synchronized oscillations in a growing population of cells. Using microfluidic devices tailored for cellular populations at differing length scales, we investigate the collective synchronization properties along with spatiotemporal waves occurring at millimetre scales. We use computational modelling to describe quantitatively the observed dependence of the period and amplitude of the bulk oscillations on the flow rate. The synchronized genetic clock sets the stage for the use of microbes in the creation of a macroscopic biosensor with an oscillatory output. Furthermore, it provides a specific model system for the generation of a mechanistic description of emergent coordinated behaviour at the colony level.","Danino, Tal; Mondragon-Palomino, Octavio; Tsimring, Lev; Hasty, Jeff","Danino, T; Mondragon-Palomino, O; Tsimring, L; Hasty, J",326.0,"[Danino, Tal; Mondragon-Palomino, Octavio; Hasty, Jeff] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Bioengn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Tsimring, Lev; Hasty, Jeff] Univ Calif San Diego, BioCircuits Inst, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Hasty, Jeff] Univ Calif, Div Biol Sci, Mol Biol Sect, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08753,Article,,hasty@bioeng.ucsd.edu,330,National Institutes of Health and General Medicine [GM69811]; DOE CSGF; CONACyT (Mexico) [184646],"We thank J.

The ten-eleven translocation (Tet) dioxygenases convert 5mC to 5hmC, 5fC and 5caC in three consecutive, Fe(II)- and alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent oxidation reactions(1-4). The Tet family of dioxygenases is widely distributed across the tree of life(5), including in the heterolobosean amoeboflagellate Naegleria gruberi. The genome of Naegleria(6) encodes homologues of mammalian DNA methyltransferase and Tet proteins(7). Here we study biochemically and structurally one of the Naegleria Tet-like proteins (NgTet1), which shares significant sequence conservation (approximately 14% identity or 39% similarity) with mammalian Tet1. Like mammalian Tet proteins, NgTet1 acts on 5mC and generates 5hmC, 5fC and 5caC. The crystal structure of NgTet1 in complex with DNA containing a 5mCpG site revealed that NgTet1 uses a base-flipping mechanism to access 5mC. The DNA is contacted from the minor groove and bent towards the major groove. The flipped 5mC is positioned in the active-site pocket with planar stacking contacts, Watson-Crick polar hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions specific for 5mC. The sequence conservation between NgTet1 and mammalian Tet1, including residues involved in structural integrity and functional significance, suggests structural conservation across phyla.","Hashimoto, Hideharu; Pais, June E.; Zhang, Xing; Saleh, Lana; Fu, Zheng-Qing; Dai, Nan; Correa, Ivan R., Jr.; Zheng, Yu; Cheng, Xiaodong","Hashimoto, H; Pais, JE; Zhang, X; Saleh, L; Fu, ZQ; Dai, N; Correa, IR; Zheng, Y; Cheng, XD",391.0,"[Hashimoto, Hideharu; Zhang, Xing; Cheng, Xiaodong] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Pais, June E.; Saleh, Lana; Dai, Nan; Correa, Ivan R., Jr.; Zheng, Yu] New England Biolabs Inc, Ipswich, MA 01938 USA; [Fu, Zheng-Qing] Univ Georgia, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Fu, Zheng-Qing] Argonne Natl Lab, Adv Photon Source, Sect 22, Argonne, IL 60439 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12905,Article,1476-4687,zhengy@neb.com; xcheng@emory.edu,+,"National Institutes of Health [GM049245, GM095209, GM105132]","We thank R.

111,100,200.0,"Generally, the motion of fluids is smooth and laminar at low speeds but becomes highly disordered and turbulent as the velocity increases. The transition from laminar to turbulent flow can involve a sequence of instabilities in which the system realizes progressively more complicated states(1), or it can occur suddenly(2,3). Once the transition has taken place, it is generally assumed that, under steady conditions, the turbulent state will persist indefinitely. The flow of a fluid down a straight pipe provides a ubiquitous example of a shear flow undergoing a sudden transition from laminar to turbulent motion(4-6). Extensive calculations(7,8) and experimental studies(9) have shown that, at relatively low flow rates, turbulence in pipes is transient, and is characterized by an exponential distribution of lifetimes. They(8,9) also suggest that for Reynolds numbers exceeding a critical value the lifetime diverges (that is, becomes infinitely large), marking a change from transient to persistent turbulence. Here we present experimental data and numerical calculations covering more than two decades of lifetimes, showing that the lifetime does not in fact diverge but rather increases exponentially with the Reynolds number.

CLAVATA signalling involves a secreted peptide, CLAVATA3 (CLV3)(2), and its perception by cell surface leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptors, including the CLV1 receptor kinase(3) and a LRR receptor-like protein, CLV2 (ref. 4). However, the signalling mechanisms downstream of these receptors are poorly understood, especially for LRR receptor-like proteins, which lack a signalling domain(5). Here we show that maize COMPACT PLANT2 (CT2) encodes the predicted alpha-subunit (G alpha) of a heterotrimeric GTP binding protein. Maize ct2 phenotypes resemble Arabidopsis thaliana clavata mutants, and genetic, biochemical and functional assays indicate that CT2/G alpha transmits a stem-cell-restrictive signal from a CLAVATA LRR receptor, suggesting a new function for G alpha signalling in plants. Heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins are membrane-associated molecular switches that are commonly activated by ligand binding to an associated seven-pass transmembrane (7TM) G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)(6). Recent studies have questioned the idea that plant heterotrimeric G proteins interact with canonical GPCRs(7), and our findings suggest that single pass transmembrane receptors act as GPCRs in plants, challenging the dogma that GPCRs are exclusively 7TM proteins.","Bommert, Peter; Il Je, Byoung; Goldshmidt, Alexander; Jackson, David","Bommert, P; Il Je, B; Goldshmidt, A; Jackson, D",555.0,"[Bommert, Peter; Il Je, Byoung; Goldshmidt, Alexander; Jackson, David] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12583,Article,1476-4687,jacksond@cshl.edu,+,DFG [Bo 3012/1-1]; BARD [FI-431-2008]; Dupont-Pioneer; National Science Foundation [DBI-0604923],"The authors thank T.

114,180,480.0,"Cyclostomes, the living jawless vertebrates including hagfishes and lampreys, represent the most basal lineage of vertebrates. Although the monophyly of cyclostomes has been supported by recent molecular analyses, the phenotypic traits of hagfishes, especially the lack of some vertebrate-defining features and the reported endodermal origin of the adenohypophysis, have been interpreted as hagfishes exhibiting a more ancestral state than those of all other vertebrates. Furthermore, the adult anatomy of hagfishes cannot be compared easily with that of lampreys. Here we describe the craniofacial development of a series of staged hagfish embryos, which shows that their adenohypophysis arises ectodermally, consistent with the molecular phylogenetic data. This finding also allowed us to identify a pan-cyclostome pattern, one not shared by jawed vertebrates. Comparative analyses indicated that many of the hagfish-specific traits can be explained by changes secondarily introduced into the hagfish lineage. We also propose a possibility that the pan-cyclostome pattern may reflect the ancestral programme for the craniofacial development of all living vertebrates.","Oisi, Yasuhiro; Ota, Kinya G.; Kuraku, Shigehiro; Fujimoto, Satoko; Kuratani, Shigeru","Oisi, Y; Ota, KG; Kuraku, S; Fujimoto, S; Kuratani, S",175.0,"[Oisi, Yasuhiro] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biol, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan; [Oisi, Yasuhiro; Fujimoto, Satoko; Kuratani, Shigeru] RIKEN Ctr Dev Biol, Lab Evolutionary Morphol, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan; [Ota, Kinya G.] Acad Sinica, Inst Cellular & Organism Biol, Marine Res Stn, Yilan 26242, Taiwan; [Kuraku, Shigehiro] RIKEN Ctr Dev Biol, Genome Resource & Anal Unit, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11794,Article,1476-4687,saizo@cdb.riken.jp,180,,,066YY,,,LETHENTERON-JAPONICUM; BDELLOSTOMA STOUTI; LAMPETRA-JAPONICA; TRIGEMINAL NERVE; NEURAL CREST; GENES; EXPRESSION; LAMPREYS; ADENOHYPOPHYSIS; ORGANIZATION,7431.0,NATURE,Nature,English,50.0,No,"Kuratani, Shigeru/0000-0001-9717-7221; ","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",10-Jan,6.0,LONDON,23254938.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2013.0,"Kuratani, Shigeru/J-4146-2014; Kuraku, Shigehiro/B-2801-2009","Kuratani, S (reprint author), RIKEN Ctr Dev Biol, Lab Evolutionary Morphol, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,45.0,Craniofacial development of hagfishes and the evolution of vertebrates,3.0,112.0,WOS:000313259600030,480.0,493,Multidisciplinary Sciences,51,shigeru,kuratani,9413.0,3,male,1.0,_UKuUx8AAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",3338527,1,3338527,1,Cyclostomata,Cyclostomata,0,0
115,47,295.0,"The Myc oncogene regulates the expression of several components of the protein synthetic machinery, including ribosomal proteins, initiation factors of translation, RNA polymerase III and ribosomal DNA(1,2). Whether and how increasing the cellular protein synthesis capacity affects the multistep process leading to cancer remains to be addressed. Here we use ribosomal protein heterozygote mice as a genetic tool to restore increased protein synthesis in E mu-Myc/+ transgenic mice to normal levels, and show that the oncogenic potential of Myc in this context is suppressed. Our findings demonstrate that the ability of Myc to increase protein synthesis directly augments cell size and is sufficient to accelerate cell cycle progression independently of known cell cycle targets transcriptionally regulated by Myc. In addition, when protein synthesis is restored to normal levels, Myc- overexpressing precancerous cells are more efficiently eliminated by programmed cell death. Our findings reveal a new mechanism that links increases in general protein synthesis rates downstream of an oncogenic signal to a specific molecular impairment in the modality of translation initiation used to regulate the expression of selective messenger RNAs. We show that an aberrant increase in cap- dependent translation downstream of Myc hyperactivation specifically impairs the translational switch to internal ribosomal entry site ( IRES)- dependent translation that is required for accurate mitotic progression. Failure of this translational switch results in reduced mitotic- specific expression of the endogenous IRES- dependent form of Cdk11 ( also known as Cdc21 and PITSLRE)(3-5), which leads to cytokinesis defects and is associated with increased centrosome numbers and genome instability in E mu-Myc/+ mice. When accurate translational control is re- established in E mu-Myc/+ mice, genome instability is suppressed. Our findings demonstrate how perturbations in translational control provide a highly specific outcome for gene expression, genome stability and cancer initiation that have important implications for understanding the molecular mechanism of cancer formation at the post- genomic level.","Barna, Maria; Pusic, Aya; Zollo, Ornella; Costa, Maria; Kondrashov, Nadya; Rego, Eduardo; Rao, Pulivarthi H.; Ruggero, Davide","Barna, M; Pusic, A; Zollo, O; Costa, M; Kondrashov, N; Rego, E; Rao, PH; Ruggero, D",971.0,"[Barna, Maria; Kondrashov, Nadya] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem & Biophys, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Pusic, Aya; Zollo, Ornella; Costa, Maria; Ruggero, Davide] Univ Calif San Francisco, Helen Diller Family Comprehens Canc Ctr, Sch Med, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Pusic, Aya; Zollo, Ornella; Costa, Maria; Ruggero, Davide] Univ Calif San Francisco, Helen Diller Family Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dept Urol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Rego, Eduardo] Univ Sao Paulo, Ctr Cell Based Therapy, Fdn Hemoctr Ribeirao Preto, BR-14048900 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Rao, Pulivarthi H.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Pediat, Houston, TX 77030 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07449,Article,1476-4687,maria.barna@ucsf.edu; Davide.Ruggero@ucsf.edu,U79,NIH; Sandler Foundation,"We thank F.

116,221,282.0,"The formation of the first massive objects in the infant Universe remains impossible to observe directly and yet it sets the stage for the subsequent evolution of galaxies(1-3). Although some black holes with masses more than 10(9) times that of the Sun have been detected in luminous quasars less than one billion years after the Big Bang(4,5), these individual extreme objects have limited utility in constraining the channels of formation of the earliest black holes; this is because the initial conditions of black hole seed properties are quickly erased during the growth process(6). Here we report a measurement of the amount of black hole growth in galaxies at redshift z = 6-8 (0.95-0.7 billion years after the Big Bang), based on optimally stacked, archival X-ray observations. Our results imply that black holes grow in tandem with their host galaxies throughout cosmic history, starting from the earliest times. We find that most copiously accreting black holes at these epochs are buried in significant amounts of gas and dust that absorb most radiation except for the highest-energy X-rays. This suggests that black holes grew significantly more during these early bursts than was previously thought, but because of the obscuration of their ultraviolet emission they did not contribute to the re-ionization of the Universe.","Treister, Ezequiel; Schawinski, Kevin; Volonteri, Marta; Natarajan, Priyamvada; Gawiser, Eric","Treister, E; Schawinski, K; Volonteri, M; Natarajan, P; Gawiser, E",356.0,"[Treister, Ezequiel] Univ Hawaii, Inst Astron, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Treister, Ezequiel] Univ Concepcion, Dept Astron, Concepcion, Chile; [Schawinski, Kevin; Natarajan, Priyamvada] Yale Ctr Astron & Astrophys, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Schawinski, Kevin; Natarajan, Priyamvada] Yale Univ, Dept Phys, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Volonteri, Marta] Univ Michigan, Dept Astron, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Natarajan, Priyamvada] Yale Univ, Dept Astron, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Natarajan, Priyamvada] Harvard Univ, Inst Theory & Computat, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Gawiser, Eric] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10103,Article,1476-4687,treister@ifa.hawaii.edu,358,,,777TD,,,ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; ULTRA DEEP FIELD; Z QUASAR SURVEY; LUMINOSITY FUNCTION; GALAXY FORMATION; REDSHIFT QUASARS; DISCOVERY; DENSITY; MODELS,7351.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,"Schawinski, Kevin/0000-0001-5464-0888; Treister, Ezequiel/0000-0001-7568-6412","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",16-Jun,3.0,LONDON,21677753.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2011.0,,"Treister, E (reprint author), Univ Hawaii, Inst Astron, 2680 Woodlawn Dr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,52.0,Black hole growth in the early Universe is self-regulated and largely hidden from view,1.0,3.0,WOS:000291647100040,282.0,474,Multidisciplinary Sciences,52,eric,gawiser,12277.0,4110,male,1.0,D5b2ctAAAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
117,116,323.0,"The E3 ubiquitin ligase PARKIN (encoded by PARK2) and the protein kinase PINK1 (encoded by PARK6) are mutated in autosomal-recessive juvenile Parkinsonism (AR-JP) and work together in the disposal of damaged mitochondria by mitophagy(1-3). PINK1 is stabilized on the outside of depolarized mitochondria and phosphorylates polyubiquitin(4-8) as well as the PARKIN ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain(9,10). These phosphorylation events lead to PARKIN recruitment to mitochondria, and activation by an unknown allosteric mechanism(4-12). Here we present the crystal structure of Pediculus humanus PARKIN in complex with Ser65-phosphorylated ubiquitin (phosphoUb), revealing the molecular basis for PARKIN recruitment and activation. The phosphoUb binding site on PARKIN comprises a conserved phosphate pocket and harbours residues mutated in patients with AR-JP. PhosphoUb binding leads to straightening of a helix in the RING1 domain, and the resulting conformational changes release the Ubl domain from the PARKIN core; this activates PARKIN. Moreover, phosphoUb-mediated Ubl release enhances Ubl phosphorylation by PINK1, leading to conformational changes within the Ubl domain and stabilization of an open, active conformation of PARKIN. We redefine the role of the Ubl domain not only as an inhibitory(13) but also as an activating element that is restrained in inactive PARKIN and released by phosphoUb.

118,135,360.0,"Groundwater use in California's San Joaquin Valley exceeds replenishment of the aquifer, leading to substantial diminution of this resource(1-4) and rapid subsidence of the valley floor(5). The volume of groundwater lost over the past century and a half also represents a substantial reduction in mass and a large-scale unburdening of the lithosphere, with significant but unexplored potential impacts on crustal deformation and seismicity. Here we use vertical global positioning system measurements to show that a broad zone of rock uplift of up to 1-3 mm per year surrounds the southern San Joaquin Valley. The observed uplift matches well with predicted flexure from a simple elastic model of current rates of water-storage loss, most of which is caused by groundwater depletion(3). The height of the adjacent central Coast Ranges and the Sierra Nevada is strongly seasonal and peaks during the dry late summer and autumn, out of phase with uplift of the valley floor during wetter months. Our results suggest that long-term and late-summer flexural uplift of the Coast Ranges reduce the effective normal stress resolved on the San Andreas Fault. This process brings the fault closer to failure, thereby providing a viable mechanism for observed seasonality in microseismicity at Parkfield(6) and potentially affecting long-term seismicity rates for fault systems adjacent to the valley. We also infer that the observed contemporary uplift of the southern Sierra Nevada previously attributed to tectonic or mantle-derived forces(7-10) is partly a consequence of human-caused groundwater depletion.","Amos, Colin B.; Audet, Pascal; Hammond, William C.; Buergmann, Roland; Johanson, Ingrid A.; Blewitt, Geoffrey","Amos, CB; Audet, P; Hammond, WC; Burgmann, R; Johanson, IA; Blewitt, G",483.0,"[Amos, Colin B.] Western Washington Univ, Dept Geol, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA; [Audet, Pascal] Univ Ottawa, Dept Earth Sci, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Hammond, William C.; Blewitt, Geoffrey] Univ Nevada, Nevada Geodet Lab, Nevada Bur Mines & Geol, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Hammond, William C.; Blewitt, Geoffrey] Univ Nevada, Nevada Seismol Lab, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Buergmann, Roland; Johanson, Ingrid A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley Seismol Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Buergmann, Roland] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13275,Article,1476-4687,colin.amos@wwu.edu,+,NSF Earth Scope award [EAR-1252210],"Funding for this work comes from NSF Earth Scope award number EAR-1252210 to G.

119,57,89.0,"In many biological examples of cooperation, individuals that cooperate cannot benefit from the resulting public good. This is especially clear in cases of self- destructive cooperation, where individuals die when helping others. If self- destructive cooperation is genetically encoded, these genes can only be maintained if they are expressed by just a fraction of their carriers, whereas the other fraction benefits from the public good. One mechanism that can mediate this differentiation into two phenotypically different sub- populations is phenotypic noise(1,2). Here we show that noisy expression of self- destructive cooperation can evolve if individuals that have a higher probability for self- destruction have, on average, access to larger public goods. This situation, which we refer to as assortment, can arise if the environment is spatially structured. These results provide a new perspective on the significance of phenotypic noise in bacterial pathogenesis: it might promote the formation of cooperative sub- populations that die while preparing the ground for a successful infection. We show experimentally that this model captures essential features of Salmonella typhimurium pathogenesis. We conclude that noisily expressed self- destructive cooperative actions can evolve under conditions of assortment, that self- destructive cooperation is a plausible biological function of phenotypic noise, and that self- destructive cooperation mediated by phenotypic noise could be important in bacterial pathogenesis.","Ackermann, Martin; Stecher, Baerbel; Freed, Nikki E.; Songhet, Pascal; Hardt, Wolf-Dietrich; Doebeli, Michael","Ackermann, M; Stecher, B; Freed, NE; Songhet, P; Hardt, WD; Doebeli, M",987.0,"[Ackermann, Martin; Freed, Nikki E.] ETH, Inst Integrat Biol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Stecher, Baerbel; Songhet, Pascal; Hardt, Wolf-Dietrich] ETH, Inst Microbiol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Doebeli, Michael] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Doebeli, Michael] Univ British Columbia, Dept Math, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07067,Article,1476-4687,martin.ackermann@env.ethz.ch; hardt@micro.biol.ethz.ch; doebeli@zoology.ubc.ca,990,Roche Research Foundation; Novartis Foundation; NSERC ( Canada); UBS foundation; ETH research foundation [TH-10 06-1]; Swiss National Science Foundation [310000-113623/1]; European Union [SavinMucoPath number 032296],"We are grateful to Markus Schlumberger, K.

120,109,17.0,"Eukaryotic transcription factors (TFs) are key determinants of gene activity, yet they bind only a fraction of their corresponding DNA sequence motifs in any given cell type(1). Chromatin has the potential to restrict accessibility of binding sites; however, in which context chromatin states are instructive for TF binding remains mainly unknown(1,2). To explore the contribution of DNA methylation to constrained TF binding, we mapped DNase-I-hypersensitive sites in murine stem cells in the presence and absence of DNA methylation. Methylation-restricted sites are enriched for TF motifs containing CpGs, especially for those of NRF1. In fact, the TF NRF1 occupies several thousand additional sites in the unmethylated genome, resulting in increased transcription. Restoring de novo methyltransferase activity initiates remethylation at these sites and outcompetes NRF1 binding. This suggests that binding of DNA-methylation-sensitive TFs relies on additional determinants to induce local hypomethylation. In support of this model, removal of neighbouring motifs in cis or of a TF in trans causes local hypermethylation and subsequent loss of NRF1 binding. This competition between DNA methylation and TFs in vivo reveals a case of cooperativity between TFs that acts indirectly via DNA methylation. Methylation removal by methylation-insensitive factors enables occupancy of methylation-sensitive factors, a principle that rationalizes hypomethylation of regulatory regions.","Domcke, Silvia; Bardet, Anais Flore; Ginno, Paul Adrian; Hartl, Dominik; Burger, Lukas; Schuebeler, Dirk","Domcke, S; Bardet, AF; Ginno, PA; Hartl, D; Burger, L; Schubeler, D",575.0,"[Domcke, Silvia; Bardet, Anais Flore; Ginno, Paul Adrian; Hartl, Dominik; Burger, Lukas; Schuebeler, Dirk] Friedrich Miescher Inst Biomed Res, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland; [Domcke, Silvia; Hartl, Dominik; Schuebeler, Dirk] Univ Basel, Fac Sci, CH-4003 Basel, Switzerland; [Burger, Lukas] Swiss Inst Bioinformat, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature16462,Article,1476-4687,dirk@fmi.ch,+,Novartis Research Foundation; European Union (NoE 'EpiGeneSys') [FP7-HEALTH-2010-257082]; European Union ('Blueprint' consortium) [FP7-282510]; European Research Council (EpiGePlas); Swiss initiative in Systems Biology (RTD Cell Plasticity); EMBO postdoctoral long-term fellowships; Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds,"We are grateful to S.

121,99,154.0,"In standard fluid dynamics(1,2), the density change associated with flow is often assumed to be negligible, implying that the fluid is incompressible. For example, this has been established for simple shear flows, where no pressure change is associated with flow: there is no volume deformation due to viscous stress and inertial effects can be neglected. Accordingly, any flow-induced instabilities ( such as cavitation) are unexpected for simple shear flows. Here we demonstrate that the incompressibility condition can be violated even for simple shear flows, by taking into account the coupling between the flow and density fluctuations, which arises owing to the density dependence of the viscosity. We show that a liquid can become mechanically unstable above a critical shear rate that is given by the inverse of the derivative of viscosity with respect to pressure. Our model predicts that, for very viscous liquids, this shear-induced instability should occur at moderate shear rates that are experimentally accessible. Our results explain the unusual shear-induced instability observed in viscous lubricants(3-5), and may illuminate other poorly understood phenomena associated with mechanical instability of liquids at low Reynolds number; for example, shear-induced cavitation and bubble growth(6), and shear-banding of very viscous liquids such as metallic glasses(7) and the Earth's mantle(8).","Furukawa, Akira; Tanaka, Hajime","Furukawa, A; Tanaka, H",434.0,"Univ Tokyo, Inst Ind Sci, Tokyo 1538505, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature05119,Article,,furu@iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp,438,,,088FY,,,POLYMER-SOLUTIONS; STRESS RHEOLOGY; HIGH-PRESSURE; LUBRICANTS; VISCOSITY; FLUCTUATIONS; STATE; TEMPERATURE; DEPENDENCE; FLUIDS,7110.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,"Tanaka, Hajime/0000-0002-4444-1890; ","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",28-Sep,5.0,LONDON,17006510.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,"Tanaka, Hajime/A-9653-2008; Furukawa, Akira/C-8629-2009","Furukawa, A (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Inst Ind Sci, 4-6-1 Komaba, Tokyo 1538505, Japan.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,26.0,Violation of the incompressibility of liquid by simple shear flow,3.0,40.0,WOS:000240798800041,154.0,443,Multidisciplinary Sciences,26,hajime,tanaka,15523.0,4,male,1.0,2gcE8bwAAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",16715156,1,2070128,1,Romeo Tanaka,Romeo Tanaka,1,1
122,32,14.0,"Nucleosomes compact and regulate access to DNA in the nucleus, and are composed of approximately 147 bases of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer(1,2). Here we report a genome-wide nucleosome positioning analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana using massively parallel sequencing of mononucleosomes. By combining this data with profiles of DNA methylation at single base resolution, we identified 10-base periodicities in the DNA methylation status of nucleosome-bound DNA and found that nucleosomal DNA was more highly methylated than flanking DNA. These results indicate that nucleosome positioning influences DNA methylation patterning throughout the genome and that DNA methyltransferases preferentially target nucleosome-bound DNA. We also observed similar trends in human nucleosomal DNA, indicating that the relationships between nucleosomes and DNA methyltransferases are conserved. Finally, as has been observed in animals, nucleosomes were highly enriched on exons, and preferentially positioned at intron-exon and exon-intron boundaries. RNA polymerase II (Pol II) was also enriched on exons relative to introns, consistent with the hypothesis that nucleosome positioning regulates Pol II processivity. DNA methylation is also enriched on exons, consistent with the targeting of DNA methylation to nucleosomes, and suggesting a role for DNA methylation in exon definition.","Chodavarapu, Ramakrishna K.; Feng, Suhua; Bernatavichute, Yana V.; Chen, Pao-Yang; Stroud, Hume; Yu, Yanchun; Hetzel, Jonathan A.; Kuo, Frank; Kim, Jin; Cokus, Shawn J.; Casero, David; Bernal, Maria; Huijser, Peter; Clark, Amander T.; Kraemer, Ute; Merchant, Sabeeha S.; Zhang, Xiaoyu; Jacobsen, Steven E.; Pellegrini, Matteo","Chodavarapu, RK; Feng, SH; Bernatavichute, YV; Chen, PY; Stroud, H; Yu, YC; Hetzel, JA; Kuo, F; Kim, J; Cokus, SJ; Casero, D; Bernal, M; Huijser, P; Clark, AT; Kramer, U; Merchant, SS; Zhang, XY; Jacobsen, SE; Pellegrini, M",388.0,"[Chodavarapu, Ramakrishna K.; Feng, Suhua; Bernatavichute, Yana V.; Chen, Pao-Yang; Stroud, Hume; Hetzel, Jonathan A.; Kuo, Frank; Kim, Jin; Cokus, Shawn J.; Casero, David; Clark, Amander T.; Jacobsen, Steven E.; Pellegrini, Matteo] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Mol Cell & Dev Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Feng, Suhua; Jacobsen, Steven E.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Bernatavichute, Yana V.; Merchant, Sabeeha S.; Jacobsen, Steven E.; Pellegrini, Matteo] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Mol Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Yu, Yanchun; Zhang, Xiaoyu] Univ Georgia, Dept Plant Biol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Bernal, Maria; Kraemer, Ute] Univ Heidelberg, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Huijser, Peter] Max Planck Inst Plant Breeding Res, Dept Mol Plant Genet, D-50829 Cologne, Germany; [Clark, Amander T.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Eli & Edythe Broad Ctr Regenerat Med & Stem Cell, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Merchant, Sabeeha S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Chem & Biochem, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09147,Article,,jacobsen@ucla.edu; matteop@mcdb.ucla.edu,392,"Department of Energy, Institute for Genomics and Proteomics; NIH [GM07104, GM60398, GM42143]; Eli & Edythe Broad Center of Regenerative Medicine & Stem Cell Research at UCLA; Alexander-von-Humboldt Fellowship; Heisenberg Fellowship; University of Georgia [JR-040]; NSF [0701745]","We thank members of our laboratories for input and guidance, and the Department of Energy, Institute for Genomics and Proteomics for support.

123,269,479.0,"Enhancers control the correct temporal and cell-type-specific activation of gene expression in multicellular eukaryotes. Knowing their properties, regulatory activity and targets is crucial to understand the regulation of differentiation and homeostasis. Here we use the FANTOM5 panel of samples, covering the majority of human tissues and cell types, to produce an atlas of active, in vivo-transcribed enhancers. We show that enhancers share properties with CpG-poor messenger RNA promoters but produce bidirectional, exosome-sensitive, relatively short unspliced RNAs, the generation of which is strongly related to enhancer activity. The atlas is used to compare regulatory programs between different cells at unprecedented depth, to identify disease-associated regulatory single nucleotide polymorphisms, and to classify cell-type-specific and ubiquitous enhancers. We further explore the utility of enhancer redundancy, which explains gene expression strength rather than expression patterns. The online FANTOM5 enhancer atlas represents a unique resource for studies on cell-type-specific enhancers and gene regulation.","Andersson, Robin; Gebhard, Claudia; Miguel-Escalada, Irene; Hoof, Ilka; Bornholdt, Jette; Boyd, Mette; Chen, Yun; Zhao, Xiaobei; Schmidl, Christian; Suzuki, Takahiro; Ntini, Evgenia; Arner, Erik; Valen, Eivind; Li, Kang; Schwarzfischer, Lucia; Glatz, Dagmar; Raithel, Johanna; Lilje, Berit; Rapin, Nicolas; Bagger, Frederik Otzen; Jorgensen, Mette; Andersen, Peter Refsing; Bertin, Nicolas; Rackham, Owen; Burroughs, A.

124,297,448.0,"We are facing a global metabolic health crisis provoked by an obesity epidemic. Here we report the human gut microbial composition in a population sample of 123 non-obese and 169 obese Danish individuals. We find two groups of individuals that differ by the number of gut microbial genes and thus gut bacterial richness. They contain known and previously unknown bacterial species at different proportions; individuals with a low bacterial richness (23% of the population) are characterized by more marked overall adiposity, insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia and a more pronounced inflammatory phenotype when compared with high bacterial richness individuals. The obese individuals among the lower bacterial richness group also gain more weight over time. Only a few bacterial species are sufficient to distinguish between individuals with high and low bacterial richness, and even between lean and obese participants. Our classifications based on variation in the gut microbiome identify subsets of individuals in the general white adult population who may be at increased risk of progressing to adiposity-associated co-morbidities.","Le Chatelier, Emmanuelle; Nielsen, Trine; Qin, Junjie; Prifti, Edi; Hildebrand, Falk; Falony, Gwen; Almeida, Mathieu; Arumugam, Manimozhiyan; Batto, Jean-Michel; Kennedy, Sean; Leonard, Pierre; Li, Junhua; Burgdorf, Kristoffer; Grarup, Niels; Jorgensen, Torben; Brandslund, Ivan; Nielsen, Henrik Bjorn; Juncker, Agnieszka S.; Bertalan, Marcelo; Levenez, Florence; Pons, Nicolas; Rasmussen, Simon; Sunagawa, Shinichi; Tap, Julien; Tims, Sebastian; Zoetendal, Erwin G.; Brunak, Soren; Clement, Karine; Dore, Joel; Kleerebezem, Michiel; Kristiansen, Karsten; Renault, Pierre; Sicheritz-Ponten, Thomas; de Vos, Willem M.; Zucker, Jean-Daniel; Raes, Jeroen; Hansen, Torben; Bork, Peer; Wang, Jun; Ehrlich, S.

125,324,441.0,"The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway regulates organismal growth in response to many environmental cues, including nutrients and growth factors(1). Cell-based studies showed that mTORC1 senses amino acids through the RagA-D family of GTPases(2,3) (also known as RRAGA, B, C and D), but their importance in mammalian physiology is unknown. Here we generate knock-in mice that express a constitutively active form of RagA (RagA(GTP)) from its endogenous promoter. RagA(GTP/GTP) mice develop normally, but fail to survive postnatal day 1. When delivered by Caesarean section, fasted RagA(GTP/GTP) neonates die almost twice as rapidly as wild-type littermates. Within an hour of birth, wild-type neonates strongly inhibit mTORC1, which coincides with profound hypoglycaemia and a decrease in plasma amino-acid concentrations. In contrast, mTORC1 inhibition does not occur in RagA(GTP/GTP) neonates, despite identical reductions in blood nutrient amounts. With prolonged fasting, wild-type neonates recover their plasma glucose concentrations, but RagA(GTP/GTP) mice remain hypoglycaemic until death, despite using glycogen at a faster rate. The glucose homeostasis defect correlates with the inability of fasted RagA(GTP/GTP) neonates to trigger autophagy and produce amino acids for de novo glucose production. Because profound hypoglycaemia does not inhibit mTORC1 inRagA(GTP/GTP) neonates, we considered the possibility that the Rag pathway signals glucose as well as amino-acid sufficiency to mTORC1. Indeed, mTORC1 is resistant to glucose deprivation in RagA(GTP/GTP) fibroblasts, and glucose, like amino acids, controls its recruitment to the lysosomal surface, the site of mTORC1 activation. Thus, the Rag GTPases signal glucose and amino-acid concentrations to mTORC1, and have an unexpectedly key role in neonates in autophagy induction and thus nutrient homeostasis and viability.","Efeyan, Alejo; Zoncu, Roberto; Chang, Steven; Gumper, Iwona; Snitkin, Harriet; Wolfson, Rachel L.; Kirak, Oktay; Sabatini, David D.; Sabatini, David M.","Efeyan, A; Zoncu, R; Chang, S; Gumper, I; Snitkin, H; Wolfson, RL; Kirak, O; Sabatini, DD; Sabatini, DM",679.0,"[Efeyan, Alejo; Zoncu, Roberto; Chang, Steven; Wolfson, Rachel L.; Kirak, Oktay; Sabatini, David M.] Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Efeyan, Alejo; Zoncu, Roberto; Chang, Steven; Wolfson, Rachel L.; Sabatini, David M.] Broad Inst Harvard & Massachusetts Inst Technol, Seven Cambridge Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Efeyan, Alejo; Zoncu, Roberto; Chang, Steven; Wolfson, Rachel L.; Sabatini, David M.] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Efeyan, Alejo; Zoncu, Roberto; Chang, Steven; Wolfson, Rachel L.; Sabatini, David M.] MIT, David H Koch Inst Integrat Canc Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Efeyan, Alejo; Zoncu, Roberto; Chang, Steven; Wolfson, Rachel L.; Sabatini, David M.] MIT, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Gumper, Iwona; Snitkin, Harriet; Sabatini, David D.] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, New York, NY 10016 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11745,Article,,sabatini@wi.mit.edu,+,"National Institutes of Health [R01 CA129105, R01 CA103866, R37 AI047389]; American Federation for Aging; Starr Foundation; Koch Institute Frontier Research Program; Ellison Medical Foundation; Human Frontiers Science Program; Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research; LAM Foundation","We thank members of the Sabatini laboratory for suggestions, and A.

126,235,32.0,"Mammalian cells possess mechanisms to detect and defend themselves from invading viruses. In the cytosol, the RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), RIG-I (retinoic acid-inducible gene I; encoded by DDX58) and MDA5 (melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5; encoded by IFIH1) sense atypical RNAs associated with virus infection(1,2). Detection triggers a signalling cascade via the adaptor MAVS that culminates in the production of type I interferons (IFN-alpha and beta; hereafter IFN), which are key antiviral cytokines. RIG-I and MDA5 are activated by distinct viral RNA structures and much evidence indicates that RIG-I responds to RNAs bearing a triphosphate (ppp) moiety in conjunction with a blunt-ended, base-paired region at the 5'-end (reviewed in refs 1-3). Here we show that RIG-I also mediates antiviral responses to RNAs bearing 5'-diphosphates (5'pp). Genomes from mammalian reoviruses with 5'pp termini, 5'pp-RNA isolated from yeast L-A virus, and base-paired 5'pp-RNAs made by in vitro transcription or chemical synthesis, all bind to RIG-I and serve as RIG-I agonists. Furthermore, a RIG-I-dependent response to 5'pp-RNA is essential for controlling reovirus infection in cultured cells and in mice. Thus, the minimal determinant for RIG-I recognition is a base-paired RNA with 5'pp. Such RNAs are found in some viruses but not in uninfected cells, indicating that recognition of 5'pp-RNA, like that of 5'ppp-RNA, acts as a powerful means of self/non-self discrimination by the innate immune system.","Goubau, Delphine; Schlee, Martin; Deddouche, Safia; Pruijssers, Andrea J.; Zillinger, Thomas; Goldeck, Marion; Schuberth, Christine; Van der Veen, Annemarthe G.; Fujimura, Tsutomu; Rehwinkel, Jan; Iskarpatyoti, Jason A.; Barchet, Winfried; Ludwig, Janos; Dermody, Terence S.; Hartmann, Gunther; Reis e Sousa, Caetano","Goubau, D; Schlee, M; Deddouche, S; Pruijssers, AJ; Zillinger, T; Goldeck, M; Schuberth, C; Van der Veen, AG; Fujimura, T; Rehwinkel, J; Iskarpatyoti, JA; Barchet, W; Ludwig, J; Dermody, TS; Hartmann, G; Sousa, CRE",372.0,"[Goubau, Delphine; Deddouche, Safia; Van der Veen, Annemarthe G.; Rehwinkel, Jan; Reis e Sousa, Caetano] Canc Res UK, London Res Inst, Immunobiol Lab, London WC2A 3LY, England; [Schlee, Martin; Zillinger, Thomas; Goldeck, Marion; Schuberth, Christine; Barchet, Winfried; Ludwig, Janos; Hartmann, Gunther] Univ Klinikum Bonn, Inst Klin Chem, D-53127 Bonn, Germany; [Schlee, Martin; Zillinger, Thomas; Goldeck, Marion; Schuberth, Christine; Barchet, Winfried; Ludwig, Janos; Hartmann, Gunther] Univ Klinikum Bonn, Klin Pharmakol, D-53127 Bonn, Germany; [Pruijssers, Andrea J.; Iskarpatyoti, Jason A.; Dermody, Terence S.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Pediat, Sch Med, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [Pruijssers, Andrea J.; Iskarpatyoti, Jason A.; Dermody, Terence S.] Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Elizabeth B Lamb Ctr Pediat Res, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [Fujimura, Tsutomu] Univ Salamanca, Inst Biol Func & Genom, Consejo Super Invest Cient, Salamanca 37007, Spain; [Dermody, Terence S.] Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol Microbiol & Immunol, Nashville, TN 37232 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13590,Article,1476-4687,delphine.goubau@cancer.org.uk; caetano@cancer.org.uk,+,"Cancer Research UK; European Research Council (ERC Advanced Researcher Grant) [AdG-2010-268670]; Public Health Service award [R37 AI038296]; Elizabeth B.

127,126,254.0,"Anderson localization of waves in disordered media was originally predicted(1) fifty years ago, in the context of transport of electrons in crystals(2). The phenomenon is much more general(3) and has been observed in a variety of systems, including light waves(4,5). However, Anderson localization has not been observed directly for matter waves. Owing to the high degree of control over most of the system parameters ( in particular the interaction strength), ultracold atoms offer opportunities for the study of disorder- induced localization(6). Here we use a non- interacting Bose - Einstein condensate to study Anderson localization. The experiment is performed with a one- dimensional quasi- periodic lattice - a system that features a crossover between extended and exponentially localized states, as in the case of purely random disorder in higher dimensions. Localization is clearly demonstrated through investigations of the transport properties and spatial and momentum distributions. We characterize the crossover, finding that the critical disorder strength scales with the tunnelling energy of the atoms in the lattice. This controllable system may be used to investigate the interplay of disorder and interaction ( ref. 7 and references therein), and to explore exotic quantum phases(8,9).","Roati, Giacomo; D'Errico, Chiara; Fallani, Leonardo; Fattori, Marco; Fort, Chiara; Zaccanti, Matteo; Modugno, Giovanni; Modugno, Michele; Inguscio, Massimo","Roati, G; D'Errico, C; Fallani, L; Fattori, M; Fort, C; Zaccanti, M; Modugno, G; Modugno, M; Inguscio, M",895.0,"[Roati, Giacomo; D'Errico, Chiara; Fallani, Leonardo; Fattori, Marco; Fort, Chiara; Zaccanti, Matteo; Modugno, Giovanni; Modugno, Michele; Inguscio, Massimo] Univ Florence, LENS, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, Italy; [Roati, Giacomo; D'Errico, Chiara; Fallani, Leonardo; Fattori, Marco; Fort, Chiara; Zaccanti, Matteo; Modugno, Giovanni; Modugno, Michele; Inguscio, Massimo] Univ Florence, Dept Fis, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, Italy; [Roati, Giacomo; D'Errico, Chiara; Fallani, Leonardo; Fattori, Marco; Fort, Chiara; Zaccanti, Matteo; Modugno, Giovanni; Inguscio, Massimo] INFM CNR, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, Italy; [Fattori, Marco] Ctr Studi Ric E Fermi, Museo Storico Fis, I-00184 Rome, Italy; [Modugno, Michele] Univ Florence, Dipartimento Matemat Applicata, I-50139 Florence, Italy; [Modugno, Michele] Univ Trent, BEC INFM Ctr, I-38050 Trento, Italy",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07071,Article,,inguscio@lens.unifi.it,U36,,,311WV,Y,N,QUANTUM DIFFUSION; LATTICES; LIGHT; ABSENCE,7197.0,NATURE,Nature,English,32.0,No,"Modugno, Michele/0000-0002-0532-1423; Modugno, Giovanni/0000-0002-4394-8593; FORT, Chiara/0000-0001-8817-3077; D'ERRICO, Chiara/0000-0003-0546-9900; Zaccanti, Matteo/0000-0001-6214-4921; Fallani, Leonardo/0000-0001-5327-3254","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",12-Jun,5.0,LONDON,18548066.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,"Modugno, Michele/A-6218-2009; Modugno, Giovanni/C-3179-2009; roati, giacomo/C-5459-2009; Zaccanti, Matteo/D-2474-2014; Fallani, Leonardo/C-5347-2008","Inguscio, M (reprint author), Univ Florence, LENS, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, Italy.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,780.0,Anderson localization of a non-interacting Bose-Einstein condensate,7.0,74.0,WOS:000256632000037,254.0,453,Multidisciplinary Sciences,789,massimo,inguscio,20982.0,492,male,1.0,o_E0QQUAAAAJ,5,"(17929, ]",4850065,1,3800688,1,Enrico Fermi Prize,Enrico Fermi Prize,0,0
128,203,471.0,"Wolbachia are intracellular bacteria found in the reproductive tissue of all major groups of arthropods(1,2). They are transmitted vertically from the female hosts to their offspring, in a pattern analogous to mitochondria inheritance. But Wolbachia phylogeny does not parallel that of the host, indicating that horizontal infectious transmission must also occur(3-5). Insect parasitoids are considered the most likely vectors, but the mechanism for horizontal transfer is largely unknown(4,6,7). Here we show that newly introduced Wolbachia cross several tissues and infect the germline of the adult Drosophila melanogaster female. Through investigation of bacterial migration patterns during the course of infection, we found that Wolbachia reach the germline through the somatic stem cell niche in the D. melanogaster germarium. In addition, our data suggest that Wolbachia are highly abundant in the somatic stem cell niche of long-term infected hosts, implying that this location may also contribute to efficient vertical transmission. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of an intracellular parasite displaying tropism for a stem cell niche.","Frydman, Horacio M.; Li, Jennifer M.; Robson, Drew N.; Wieschaus, Eric","Frydman, HM; Li, JM; Robson, DN; Wieschaus, E",509.0,"Princeton Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; Princeton Univ, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature04756,Article,1476-4687,hfrydman@princeton.edu,512,,,045YP,,,HORIZONTAL TRANSFER; TRICHOGRAMMA-WASPS; DROSOPHILA OVARIAN; HOST; INFECTIONS; BACTERIA; BEHAVIOR; INSECTS,7092.0,NATURE,Nature,English,27.0,No,"Frydman, Horacio/0000-0003-0191-7948","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",25-May,4.0,LONDON,16724067.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,,"Frydman, HM (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,107.0,Somatic stem cell niche tropism in Wolbachia,0.0,22.0,WOS:000237778900050,471.0,441,Multidisciplinary Sciences,110,eric,wieschaus,24843.0,4110,male,1.0,BfF2lIkAAAAJ,5,"(17929, ]",1568109,1,1568109,1,Eric F.

129,289,310.0,"Kramers developed the theory on how chemical reaction rates are influenced by the viscosity of the medium(1,2). At the viscosity of water, the kinetics of unimolecular reactions are described by diffusion of a Brownian particle over a free-energy barrier separating reactants and products. For reactions in solution this famous theory extended Eyring's transition state theory, and is widely applied in physics, chemistry and biology, including to reactions as complex as protein folding(3,4). Because the diffusion coefficient of Kramers' theory is determined by the dynamics in the sparsely populated region of the barrier top, its properties have not been directly measured for any molecular system. Here we show that the Kramers diffusion coefficient and free-energy barrier can be characterized by measuring the temperature- and viscosity-dependence of the transition path time for protein folding. The transition path is the small fraction of an equilibrium trajectory for a single molecule when the free-energy barrier separating two states is actually crossed. Its duration, the transition path time, can now be determined from photon trajectories for single protein molecules undergoing folding/unfolding transitions(5). Our finding of a long transition path time with an unusually small solvent viscosity dependence suggests that internal friction as well as solvent friction determine the Kramers diffusion coefficient for alpha-helical proteins, as opposed to a breakdown of his theory, which occurs for many small-molecule reactions(2). It is noteworthy that the new and fundamental information concerning Kramers' theory and the dynamics of barrier crossings obtained here come from experiments on a protein rather than a much simpler chemical or physical system.","Chung, Hoi Sung; Eaton, William A.","Chung, HS; Eaton, WA",685.0,"[Chung, Hoi Sung; Eaton, William A.] NIDDK, Chem Phys Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12649,Article,1476-4687,chunghoi@niddk.nih.gov; eaton@helix.nih.gov,+,"Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health","We are particularly indebted to J.

130,283,213.0,"CAAX proteins have essential roles in multiple signalling pathways, controlling processes such as proliferation, differentiation and carcinogenesis(1). The similar to 120 mammalian CAAX proteins function at cellular membranes and include the Ras superfamily of small GTPases, nuclear lamins, the gamma-subunit of heterotrimeric GTPases, and several protein kinases and phosphatases(2). The proper localization of CAAX proteins to cell membranes is orchestrated by a series of post-translational modifications of the carboxy-terminal CAAX motifs(3) (where C is cysteine, A is an aliphatic amino acid and X is any amino acid). These reactions involve prenylation of the cysteine residue, cleavage at the AAX tripeptide and methylation of the carboxyl-prenylated cysteine residue. The major CAAX protease activity is mediated by Rce1 (Ras and a-factor converting enzyme 1), an intramembrane protease (IMP) of the endoplasmic reticulum(4,5). Information on the architecture and proteolytic mechanism of Rce1 has been lacking. Here we report the crystal structure of a Methano-coccus maripaludis homologue of Rce1, whose endopeptidase specificity for farnesylated peptides mimics that of eukaryotic Rce1. Its structure, comprising eight transmembrane alpha-helices, and catalytic site are distinct from those of other IMPs. The catalytic residues are located similar to 10 angstrom into the membrane and are exposed to the cytoplasm and membrane through a conical cavity that accommodates the prenylated CAAX substrate. We propose that the farnesyl lipid binds to a site at the opening of two transmembrane alpha-helices, which results in the scissile bond being positioned adjacent to a glutamate-activated nucleophilic water molecule. This study suggests that Rce1 is the founding member of a novel IMP family, the glutamate IMPs.","Manolaridis, Ioannis; Kulkarni, Kiran; Dodd, Roger B.; Ogasawara, Satoshi; Zhang, Ziguo; Bineva, Ganka; O'Reilly, Nicola; Hanrahan, Sarah J.; Thompson, Andrew J.; Cronin, Nora; Iwata, So; Barford, David","Manolaridis, I; Kulkarni, K; Dodd, RB; Ogasawara, S; Zhang, ZG; Bineva, G; O'Reilly, N; Hanrahan, SJ; Thompson, AJ; Cronin, N; Iwata, S; Barford, D",301.0,"[Manolaridis, Ioannis; Kulkarni, Kiran; Dodd, Roger B.; Zhang, Ziguo; Hanrahan, Sarah J.; Thompson, Andrew J.; Cronin, Nora; Barford, David] Inst Canc Res, London SW3 6JB, England; [Ogasawara, Satoshi; Iwata, So] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Ogasawara, Satoshi; Iwata, So] JST, Res Accelerat Program, Membrane Prot Crystallog Project, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Bineva, Ganka; O'Reilly, Nicola] Canc Res UK London Res Inst, London WC2A 3LY, England; [Iwata, So] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Life Sci, London SW7 2AZ, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12754,Article,1476-4687,dbarford@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk,+,Cancer Research UK; Japan Science and Technology agency; BBSRC [BB/G023425/1],"This work was funded by a Cancer Research UK grant to D.

131,256,312.0,"The Indian Ocean dipole is a prominent mode of coupled ocean-atmosphere variability(1-4), affecting the lives of millions of people in Indian Ocean rim countries(5-15). In its positive phase, sea surface temperatures are lower than normal off the Sumatra-Java coast, but higher in the western tropical Indian Ocean. During the extreme positive-IOD (pIOD) events of 1961, 1994 and 1997, the eastern cooling strengthened and extended westward along the equatorial Indian Ocean through strong reversal of both the mean westerly winds and the associated eastward-flowing upper ocean currents(1,2). This created anomalously dry conditions from the eastern to the central Indian Ocean along the Equator and atmospheric convergence farther west, leading to catastrophic floods in eastern tropical African countries(13,14) but devastating droughts in eastern Indian Ocean rim countries(8-10,16,17). Despite these serious consequences, the response of pIOD events to greenhouse warming is unknown. Here, using an ensemble of climate models forced by a scenario of high greenhouse gas emissions (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5), we project that the frequency of extreme pIOD events will increase by almost a factor of three, from one event every 17.3 years over the twentieth century to one event every 6.3 years over the twenty-first century. We find that a mean state change-with weakening of both equatorial westerly winds and eastward oceanic currents in association with a faster warming in the western than the eastern equatorial Indian Ocean-facilitates more frequent occurrences of wind and oceanic current reversal. This leads to more frequent extreme pIOD events, suggesting an increasing frequency of extreme climate and weather events in regions affected by the pIOD.","Cai, Wenju; Santoso, Agus; Wang, Guojian; Weller, Evan; Wu, Lixin; Ashok, Karumuri; Masumoto, Yukio; Yamagata, Toshio","Cai, WJ; Santoso, A; Wang, GJ; Weller, E; Wu, LX; Ashok, K; Masumoto, Y; Yamagata, T",254.0,"[Cai, Wenju; Wang, Guojian; Weller, Evan] CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Aspendale, Vic 3195, Australia; [Cai, Wenju; Wang, Guojian; Wu, Lixin] Ocean Univ China, Qingdao Collaborat Innovat Ctr Marine Sci & Techn, Phys Oceanog Lab, Qingdao 266003, Peoples R China; [Santoso, Agus] Univ New S Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Santoso, Agus] Univ New S Wales, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Syst Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Ashok, Karumuri] Indian Inst Trop Meteorol, Ctr Climate Change Res, Pune 411008, Maharashtra, India; [Masumoto, Yukio] Univ Tokyo, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Grad Sch Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Masumoto, Yukio] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol JAMSTEC, Climate Variat Predictabil & Applicatabil Res Pro, Kanazawa Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan; [Yamagata, Toshio] JAMSTEC, Applicat Lab, Kanazawa Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13327,Article,1476-4687,wenju.cai@csiro.au,+,Australian Climate Change Science Program; Goyder Institute; CSIRO Office of Chief Executive Science Leader award; Australian Research Council,"W.C. and E.

132,430,399.0,"Laboratory evolution has generated many biomolecules with desired properties, but a single round of mutation, gene expression, screening or selection, and replication typically requires days or longer with frequent human intervention(1). Because evolutionary success is dependent on the total number of rounds performed(2), a means of performing laboratory evolution continuously and rapidly could dramatically enhance its effectiveness(3). Although researchers have accelerated individual steps in the evolutionary cycle(4-9), the only previous example of continuous directed evolution was the landmark study of Wright and Joyce(10), who continuously evolved RNA ligase ribozymes with an in vitro replication cycle that unfortunately cannot be easily adapted to other biomolecules. Here we describe a system that enables the continuous directed evolution of gene-encoded molecules that can be linked to protein production in Escherichia coli. During phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE), evolving genes are transferred from host cell to host cell through a modified bacteriophage life cycle in a manner that is dependent on the activity of interest. Dozens of rounds of evolution can occur in a single day of PACE without human intervention. Using PACE, we evolved T7 RNA polymerase (RNAP) variants that recognize a distinct promoter, initiate transcripts with ATP instead of GTP, and initiate transcripts with CTP. In one example, PACE executed 200 rounds of protein evolution over the course of 8 days. Starting from undetectable activity levels in two of these cases, enzymes with each of the three target activities emerged in less than 1 week of PACE. In all three cases, PACE-evolved polymerase activities exceeded or were comparable to that of the wild-type T7 RNAP on its wild-type promoter, representing improvements of up to several hundred-fold. By greatly accelerating laboratory evolution, PACE may provide solutions to otherwise intractable directed evolution problems and address novel questions about molecular evolution.","Esvelt, Kevin M.; Carlson, Jacob C.; Liu, David R.","Esvelt, KM; Carlson, JC; Liu, DR",499.0,"[Carlson, Jacob C.; Liu, David R.] Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Esvelt, Kevin M.] Harvard Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Liu, David R.] Harvard Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09929,Article,,drliu@fas.harvard.edu,U550,National Institutes of Health/National Institute of General Medical Sciences [R01 GM065400]; HHMI; Hertz Foundation; National Science Foundation; Harvard Chemical Biology Graduate Program,"This work was supported by National Institutes of Health/National Institute of General Medical Sciences R01 GM065400 and by HHMI.

133,119,71.0,"Quantum communication is a method that offers efficient and secure ways for the exchange of information in a network. Large- scale quantum communication(1-4) ( of the order of 100 km) has been achieved; however, serious problems occur beyond this distance scale, mainly due to inevitable photon loss in the transmission channel. Quantum communication eventually fails(5) when the probability of a dark count in the photon detectors becomes comparable to the probability that a photon is correctly detected. To overcome this problem, Briegel, Dur, Cirac and Zoller ( BDCZ) introduced the concept of quantum repeaters(6), combining entanglement swapping(7) and quantum memory to efficiently extend the achievable distances. Although entanglement swapping has been experimentally demonstrated(8), the implementation of BDCZ quantum repeaters has proved challenging owing to the difficulty of integrating a quantum memory. Here we realize entanglement swapping with storage and retrieval of light, a building block of the BDCZ quantum repeater. We follow a scheme(9,10) that incorporates the strategy of BDCZ with atomic quantum memories(11). Two atomic ensembles, each originally entangled with a single emitted photon, are projected into an entangled state by performing a joint Bell state measurement on the two single photons after they have passed through a 300- m fibre- based communication channel. The entanglement is stored in the atomic ensembles and later verified by converting the atomic excitations into photons. Our method is intrinsically phase insensitive and establishes the essential element needed to realize quantum repeaters with stationary atomic qubits as quantum memories and flying photonic qubits as quantum messengers.","Yuan, Zhen-Sheng; Chen, Yu-Ao; Zhao, Bo; Chen, Shuai; Schmiedmayer, Joerg; Pan, Jian-Wei","Yuan, ZS; Chen, YA; Zhao, B; Chen, S; Schmiedmayer, J; Pan, JW",1098.0,"[Yuan, Zhen-Sheng; Chen, Yu-Ao; Zhao, Bo; Chen, Shuai; Pan, Jian-Wei] Univ Heidelberg, Inst Phys, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Yuan, Zhen-Sheng; Chen, Yu-Ao; Pan, Jian-Wei] Univ Sci & Technol China, Hefei Natl Lab Phys Sci Microscale, Anhua 230026, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Zhen-Sheng; Chen, Yu-Ao; Pan, Jian-Wei] Univ Sci & Technol China, Dept Modern Phys, Anhua 230026, Peoples R China; [Schmiedmayer, Joerg] Vienna Univ Technol, Atominst Osterreichischen Univ, A-1020 Vienna, Austria",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07241,Article,,yuao@physi.uni-heidelberg.de; jian-wei.pan@physi.uni-heidelberg.de,1101,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation; Marie Curie Excellence Grant; ERC Grant; National Fundamental Research Program [2006CB921900]; CAS; NNSFC","We thank W.

134,248,239.0,"It has been proposed that memories are encoded by modification of synaptic strengths through cellular mechanisms such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD)(1). However, the causal link between these synaptic processes and memory has been difficult to demonstrate(2). Here we show that fear conditioning(3-8), a type of associative memory, can be inactivated and reactivated by LTD and LTP, respectively. We began by conditioning an animal to associate a foot shock with optogenetic stimulation of auditory inputs targeting the amygdala, a brain region known to be essential for fear conditioning(3-8). Subsequent optogenetic delivery of LTD conditioning to the auditory input inactivates memory of the shock. Then subsequent optogenetic delivery of LTP conditioning to the auditory input reactivates memory of the shock. Thus, we have engineered inactivation and reactivation of a memory using LTD and LTP, supporting a causal link between these synaptic processes and memory.","Nabavi, Sadegh; Fox, Rocky; Proulx, Christophe D.; Lin, John Y.; Tsien, Roger Y.; Malinow, Roberto","Nabavi, S; Fox, R; Proulx, CD; Lin, JY; Tsien, RY; Malinow, R",348.0,"[Nabavi, Sadegh; Fox, Rocky; Proulx, Christophe D.; Malinow, Roberto] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Neurosci, Ctr Neural Circuits & Behav, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Nabavi, Sadegh; Fox, Rocky; Proulx, Christophe D.; Malinow, Roberto] Univ Calif San Diego, Neurobiol Sect, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Lin, John Y.; Tsien, Roger Y.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Pharmacol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Tsien, Roger Y.] Univ Calif San Diego, Howard Hughes Med Inst, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13294,Article,1476-4687,rmalinow@ucsd.edu,+,"NIH [MH049159, NS27177]; Cure Alzheimer's Foundation","We thank J.

135,191,63.0,"Bites and stings from venomous creatures can produce pain and inflammation as part of their defensive strategy to ward off predators or competitors(1,2). Molecules accounting for lethal effects of venoms have been extensively characterized, but less is known about the mechanisms by which they produce pain. Venoms from spiders, snakes, cone snails or scorpions contain a pharmacopoeia of peptide toxins that block receptor or channel activation as a means of producing shock, paralysis or death(3-5). We examined whether these venoms also contain toxins that activate ( rather than inhibit) excitatory channels on somatosensory neurons to produce a noxious sensation in mammals. Here we show that venom from a tarantula that is native to the West Indies contains three inhibitor cysteine knot (ICK) peptides that target the capsaicin receptor (TRPV1), an excitatory channel expressed by sensory neurons of the pain pathway(6). In contrast with the predominant role of ICK toxins as channel inhibitors(5,7), these previously unknown 'vanillotoxins' function as TRPV1 agonists, providing new tools for understanding mechanisms of TRP channel gating. Some vanillotoxins also inhibit voltage-gated potassium channels, supporting potential similarities between TRP and voltage-gated channel structures. TRP channels can now be included among the targets of peptide toxins, showing that animals, like plants ( for example, chilli peppers), avert predators by activating TRP channels on sensory nerve fibres to elicit pain and inflammation.","Siemens, Jan; Zhou, Sharleen; Piskorowski, Rebecca; Nikai, Tetsuro; Lumpkin, Ellen A.; Basbaum, Allan I.; King, David; Julius, David","Siemens, J; Zhou, S; Piskorowski, R; Nikai, T; Lumpkin, EA; Basbaum, AI; King, D; Julius, D",208.0,"Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Cellular & Mol Pharmacol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Mass Spectrometry Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Physiol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Anat, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Physiol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, WM Keck Ctr Integrat Neurosci, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature05285,Article,,julius@cmp.ucsf.edu,212,"NIAMS NIH HHS [R01 AR051219, R01 AR051219-03]",,103DZ,,,DEPENDENT K+ CHANNELS; ION-CHANNEL; TRP CHANNELS; POTASSIUM CHANNELS; TARANTULA TOXINS; GATING MODIFIER; PEPTIDES; SENSITIVITY; INHIBITION; PEPPERS,7116.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,"Piskorowski, Rebecca/0000-0003-0120-2360","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",9-Nov,5.0,LONDON,17093448.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,"Piskorowski, Rebecca/G-6610-2017","Julius, D (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Cellular & Mol Pharmacol, 600 16th St, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,176.0,Spider toxins activate the capsaicin receptor to produce inflammatory pain,4.0,47.0,WOS:000241867200041,63.0,444,Multidisciplinary Sciences,185,david,julius,51937.0,12593,male,1.0,80jf-tkAAAAJ,5,"(17929, ]",31954213,1,149798,1,David Julius,David Julius,1,1
136,423,272.0,"The boundaries between prokaryotes, unicellular eukaryotes and multicellular eukaryotes are accompanied by orders-of-magnitude reductions in effective population size, with concurrent amplifications of the effects of random genetic drift and mutation(1). The resultant decline in the efficiency of selection seems to be sufficient to influence a wide range of attributes at the genomic level in a non-adaptive manner(2). A key remaining question concerns the extent to which variation in the power of random genetic drift is capable of influencing phylogenetic diversity at the subcellular and cellular levels(2-4). Should this be the case, population size would have to be considered as a potential determinant of the mechanistic pathways underlying long-term phenotypic evolution. Here we demonstrate a phylogenetically broad inverse relation between the power of drift and the structural integrity of protein subunits. This leads to the hypothesis that the accumulation of mildly deleterious mutations in populations of small size induces secondary selection for protein-protein interactions that stabilize key gene functions. By this means, the complex protein architectures and interactions essential to the genesis of phenotypic diversity may initially emerge by non-adaptive mechanisms.","Fernandez, Ariel; Lynch, Michael","Fernandez, A; Lynch, M",502.0,"[Lynch, Michael] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Fernandez, Ariel] Univ Chicago, Dept Comp Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Fernandez, Ariel] Rice Univ, Dept Bioengn, Houston, TX 77005 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09992,Article,,ariel@uchicago.edu; milynch@indiana.edu,U130,"National Institutes of Health [R01GM072614, R01GM036827]; Institute of Biophysical Dynamics; Department of Computer Science at The University of Chicago; National Science Foundation [EF-0827411]","A.F. was supported by National Institutes of Health grant R01GM072614, and by the Institute of Biophysical Dynamics and the Department of Computer Science at The University of Chicago.

137,170,221.0,"Periodic mesoporous materials formed through the cooperative self-assembly of surfactants and framework building blocks can assume a variety of structures(1-3), and their widely tuneable properties make them attractive hosts for numerous applications(4-7). Because the molecular movement in the pore system is the most important and defining characteristic of porous materials(8), it is of interest to learn about this behaviour as a function of local structure. Generally, individual fluorescent dye molecules can be used as molecular beacons with which to explore the structure of-and the dynamics within-these porous hosts(9-13), and single-molecule fluorescence techniques provide detailed insights into the dynamics of various processes, ranging from biology(14,15) to heterogeneous catalysis(16). However, optical microscopy methods cannot directly image the mesoporous structure of the host system accommodating the diffusing molecules, whereas transmission electron microscopy provides detailed images of the porous structure(17), but no dynamic information. It has therefore not been possible to 'see' how molecules diffuse in a real nanoscale pore structure. Here we present a combination of electron microscopic mapping and optical single-molecule tracking experiments to reveal how a single luminescent dye molecule travels through linear or strongly curved sections of a mesoporous channel system. In our approach we directly correlate porous structures detected by transmission electron microscopy with the diffusion dynamics of single molecules detected by optical microscopy. This opens up new ways of understanding the interactions of host and guest.","Zuerner, Andreas; Kirstein, Johanna; Doeblinger, Markus; Braeuchle, Christoph; Bein, Thomas","Zurner, A; Kirstein, J; Doblinger, M; Brauchle, C; Bein, T",705.0,"Univ Munich, Dept Chem & Biochem, D-81377 Munich, Germany; Univ Munich, Ctr NanoSci, D-81377 Munich, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06398,Article,,bein@lmu.de,+,,,235BY,,,SILICA; DYNAMICS; TRACKING; PORES; FILMS,7170.0,NATURE,Nature,English,21.0,No,"Bein, Thomas/0000-0001-7248-5906","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",29-Nov,5.0,LONDON,18046407.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007.0,"Bein, Thomas/G-7686-2014","Zurner, A (reprint author), Univ Munich, Dept Chem & Biochem, Butenandtstr 5-13 E, D-81377 Munich, Germany.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,134.0,Visualizing single-molecule diffusion in mesoporous materials,6.0,114.0,WOS:000251209700050,221.0,450,Multidisciplinary Sciences,134,thomas,bein,28289.0,3753,male,1.0,gU1pu4kAAAAJ,5,"(17929, ]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
138,237,83.0,"Microorganisms evolve via a range of mechanisms that may include or involve sexual/parasexual reproduction, mutators, aneuploidy, Hsp90 and even prions. Mechanisms that may seem detrimental can be repurposed to generate diversity. Here we show that the human fungal pathogen Mucor circinelloides develops spontaneous resistance to the antifungal drug FK506 (tacrolimus) via two distinct mechanisms. One involves Mendelian mutations that confer stable drug resistance; the other occurs via an epigenetic RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated pathway resulting in unstable drug resistance. The peptidylprolyl isomerase FKBP12 interacts with FK506 forming a complex that inhibits the protein phosphatase calcineurin(1). Calcineurin inhibition by FK506 blocks M. circinelloides transition to hyphae and enforces yeast growth(2). Mutations in the fkbA gene encoding FKBP12 or the calcineurin cnbR or cnaA genes confer FK506 resistance and restore hyphal growth. In parallel, RNAi is spontaneously triggered to silence the fkbA gene, giving rise to drug-resistant epimutants. FK506-resistant epimutants readily reverted to the drug-sensitive wild-type phenotype when grown without exposure to the drug. The establishment of these epimutants is accompanied by generation of abundant fkbA small RNAs and requires the RNAi pathway as well as other factors that constrain or reverse the epimutant state. Silencing involves the generation of a double-stranded RNA trigger intermediate using the fkbA mature mRNA as a template to produce antisense fkbA RNA. This study uncovers a novel epigenetic RNAi-based epimutation mechanism controlling phenotypic plasticity, with possible implications for antimicrobial drug resistance and RNAi-regulatory mechanisms in fungi and other eukaryotes.","Calo, Silvia; Shertz-Wall, Cecelia; Lee, Soo Chan; Bastidas, Robert J.; Nicolas, Francisco E.; Granek, Joshua A.; Mieczkowski, Piotr; Torres-Martinez, Santiago; Ruiz-Vazquez, Rosa M.; Cardenas, Maria E.; Heitman, Joseph","Calo, S; Shertz-Wall, C; Lee, SC; Bastidas, RJ; Nicolas, FE; Granek, JA; Mieczkowski, P; Torres-Martinez, S; Ruiz-Vazquez, RM; Cardenas, ME; Heitman, J",555.0,"[Calo, Silvia; Shertz-Wall, Cecelia; Lee, Soo Chan; Bastidas, Robert J.; Granek, Joshua A.; Cardenas, Maria E.; Heitman, Joseph] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Mol Genet & Microbiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Nicolas, Francisco E.] Reg Campus Int Excellence Campus Mare Nostrum, Murcia 30100, Spain; [Nicolas, Francisco E.; Torres-Martinez, Santiago; Ruiz-Vazquez, Rosa M.] Univ Murcia, Fac Biol, Dept Genet & Microbiol, Murcia 30100, Spain; [Granek, Joshua A.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Biostat & Bioinformat, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Granek, Joshua A.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Duke Ctr Genom Microbial Syst, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Mieczkowski, Piotr] Univ N Carolina, High Throughput Sequencing Facil, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13575,Article,1476-4687,heitm001@duke.edu,+,"NIH [R37 AI39115-17, R01 AI50438-10, R01 CA154499-04]; Spanish MICINN [BFU2009-07220]; MINECO [BFU2012-32246]; FEDER","We thank R.

139,7,128.0,"Ongoing efforts within synthetic and systems biology have been directed towards the building of artificial computational devices(1) using engineered biological units as basic building blocks(2,3). Such efforts, inspired in the standard design of electronic circuits(4-7), are limited by the difficulties arising from wiring the basic computational units (logic gates) through the appropriate connections, each one to be implemented by a different molecule. Here, we show that there is a logically different form of implementing complex Boolean logic computations that reduces wiring constraints thanks to a redundant distribution of the desired output among engineered cells. A practical implementation is presented using a library of engineered yeast cells, which can be combined in multiple ways. Each construct defines a logic function and combining cells and their connections allow building more complex synthetic devices. As a proof of principle, we have implemented many logic functions by using just a few engineered cells. Of note, small modifications and combination of those cells allowed for implementing more complex circuits such as a multiplexer or a 1-bit adder with carry, showing the great potential for re-utilization of small parts of the circuit. Our results support the approach of using cellular consortia as an efficient way of engineering complex tasks not easily solvable using single-cell implementations.","Regot, Sergi; Macia, Javier; Conde, Nuria; Furukawa, Kentaro; Kjellen, Jimmy; Peeters, Tom; Hohmann, Stefan; de Nadal, Eulalia; Posas, Francesc; Sole, Ricard","Regot, S; Macia, J; Conde, N; Furukawa, K; Kjellen, J; Peeters, T; Hohmann, S; de Nadal, E; Posas, F; Sole, R",207.0,"[Macia, Javier; Conde, Nuria; Sole, Ricard] UPF, ICREA Complex Syst Lab, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain; [Regot, Sergi; Conde, Nuria; Peeters, Tom; de Nadal, Eulalia; Posas, Francesc] UPF, Dept Ciencies Expt & Salut, Cell Signaling Unit, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain; [Furukawa, Kentaro; Kjellen, Jimmy; Hohmann, Stefan] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Cell & Mol Biol Microbiol, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Sole, Ricard] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA; [Sole, Ricard] UPF, CSIC, Inst Biol Evolut, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09679,Article,,francesc.posas@upf.edu; ricard.sole@upf.edu,211,"FPU (Spanish Government); James McDonnell Foundation; MICINN [BIO2009-07762, FIS2009-12365]; Consolider Ingenio 2010 programme [CSD2007-0015]; ESF [ERAS-CT-2003-980409]; CELLCOMPUT (FP6) project; FP7 UNICELLSYS [201142]; Santa Fe Institute; Fundacion Marcelino Botin (FMB); ICREA Academia (Generalitat de Catalunya); ICREA","We thank L.

140,368,440.0,"How adult tissue stem and niche cells respond to the nutritional state of an organism is not well understood. Here we find that Paneth cells, a key constituent of the mammalian intestinal stem-cell (ISC) niche, augment stem-cell function in response to calorie restriction. Calorie restriction acts by reducing mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signalling in Paneth cells, and the ISC-enhancing effects of calorie restriction can be mimicked by rapamycin. Calorie intake regulates mTORC1 in Paneth cells, but not ISCs, and forced activation of mTORC1 in Paneth cells during calorie restriction abolishes the ISC-augmenting effects of the niche. Finally, increased expression of bone stromal antigen 1 (Bst1) in Paneth cells-an ectoenzyme that produces the paracrine factor cyclic ADP ribose-mediates the effects of calorie restriction and rapamycin on ISC function. Our findings establish that mTORC1 non-cell-autonomously regulates stem-cell self-renewal, and highlight a significant role of the mammalian intestinal niche in coupling stem-cell function to organismal physiology.","Yilmaz, Oemer H.; Katajisto, Pekka; Lamming, Dudley W.; Gueltekin, Yetis; Bauer-Rowe, Khristian E.; Sengupta, Shomit; Birsoy, Kivanc; Dursun, Abdulmetin; Yilmaz, V.

141,276,86.0,"Although it is generally agreed that the Arctic flora is among the youngest and least diverse on Earth, the processes that shaped it are poorly understood. Here we present 50 thousand years (kyr) of Arctic vegetation history, derived from the first large-scale ancient DNA metabarcoding study of circumpolar plant diversity. For this interval we also explore nematode diversity as a proxy for modelling vegetation cover and soil quality, and diets of herbivorous megafaunal mammals, many of which became extinct around 10 kyr BP (before present). For much of the period investigated, Arctic vegetation consisted of dry steppe-tundra dominated by forbs (non-graminoid herbaceous vascular plants). During the Last Glacial Maximum (25-15 kyr BP), diversity declined markedly, although forbs remained dominant. Much changed after 10 kyr BP, with the appearance of moist tundra dominated by woody plants and graminoids. Our analyses indicate that both graminoids and forbs would have featured in megafaunal diets. As such, our findings question the predominance of a Late Quaternary graminoid-dominated Arctic mammoth steppe.","Willerslev, Eske; Davison, John; Moora, Mari; Zobel, Martin; Coissac, Eric; Edwards, Mary E.; Lorenzen, Eline D.; Vestergard, Mette; Gussarova, Galina; Haile, James; Craine, Joseph; Gielly, Ludovic; Boessenkool, Sanne; Epp, Laura S.; Pearman, Peter B.; Cheddadi, Rachid; Murray, David; Brathen, Kari Anne; Yoccoz, Nigel; Binney, Heather; Cruaud, Corinne; Wincker, Patrick; Goslar, Tomasz; Alsos, Inger Greve; Bellemain, Eva; Brysting, Anne Krag; Elven, Reidar; Sonstebo, Jorn Henrik; Murton, Julian; Sher, Andrei; Rasmussen, Morten; Ronn, Regin; Mourier, Tobias; Cooper, Alan; Austin, Jeremy; Moller, Per; Froese, Duane; Zazula, Grant; Pompanon, Franois; Rioux, Delphine; Niderkorn, Vincent; Tikhonov, Alexei; Savvinov, Grigoriy; Roberts, Richard G.; MacPhee, Ross D.

142,413,164.0,"Global warming is predicted to induce desiccation in many world regions through increases in evaporative demand(1-3). Rising CO2 may counter that trend by improving plant water-use efficiency(4,5). However, it is not clear how important this CO2-enhanced water use efficiency might be in offsetting warming-induced desiccation because higher CO2 also leads to higher plant biomass, and therefore greater transpirational surface(2,6,7). Furthermore, although warming is predicted to favour warm-season, C-4 grasses, rising CO2 should favour C-3, or cool-season plants(8). Here we show in a semi-arid grassland that elevated CO2 can completely reverse the desiccating effects of moderate warming. Although enrichment of air to 600 p. p. m. v. CO2 increased soil water content (SWC), 1.5/3.0 degrees C day/night warming resulted in desiccation, such that combined CO2 enrichment and warming had no effect on SWC relative to control plots. As predicted, elevated CO2 favoured C-3 grasses and enhanced stand productivity, whereas warming favoured C-4 grasses. Combined warming and CO2 enrichment stimulated above-ground growth of C-4 grasses in 2 of 3 years when soil moisture most limited plant productivity. The results indicate that in a warmer, CO2-enriched world, both SWC and productivity in semi-arid grasslands may be higher than previously expected.","Morgan, Jack A.; LeCain, Daniel R.; Pendall, Elise; Blumenthal, Dana M.; Kimball, Bruce A.; Carrillo, Yolima; Williams, David G.; Heisler-White, Jana; Dijkstra, Feike A.; West, Mark","Morgan, JA; LeCain, DR; Pendall, E; Blumenthal, DM; Kimball, BA; Carrillo, Y; Williams, DG; Heisler-White, J; Dijkstra, FA; West, M",202.0,"[Morgan, Jack A.; LeCain, Daniel R.; Blumenthal, Dana M.; Dijkstra, Feike A.; West, Mark] USDA ARS, Rangeland Resources Res Unit, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; [Morgan, Jack A.; LeCain, Daniel R.; Blumenthal, Dana M.; Dijkstra, Feike A.; West, Mark] USDA ARS, No Plains Area, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; [Pendall, Elise; Carrillo, Yolima; Williams, David G.; Heisler-White, Jana] Univ Wyoming, Dept Bot, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Pendall, Elise; Carrillo, Yolima; Williams, David G.; Heisler-White, Jana] Univ Wyoming, Program Ecol, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Kimball, Bruce A.] ARS, US Arid Land Agr Res Ctr, USDA, Maricopa, AZ 85238 USA; [Dijkstra, Feike A.] Univ Sydney, Fac Agr Food & Nat Resources, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10274,Article,,jack.morgan@ars.usda.gov,U101,"US Department of Agriculture; US Department of Agriculture-Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service [2008-35107-18655]; US Department of Energy's Office of Science (Biological and Environmental Research) through the Western Regional Center of the National Institute for Climatic Change Research at Northern Arizona University; National Science Foundation [1021559]","We thank D.

144,85,51.0,"Injury or impaired clearance of apoptotic cells leads to the pathological accumulation of necrotic corpses, which induce an inflammatory response that initiates tissue repair(1). In addition, antigens present in necrotic cells can sometimes provoke a specific immune response(2-4) and it has been argued that necrosis could explain adaptive immunity in seemingly infection-free situations, such as after allograft transplantation or in spontaneous and therapy-induced tumour rejection(5,6). In the mouse, the CD8 alpha(+) subset of dendritic cells phagocytoses dead cell remnants and cross-primes CD8(+) T cells against cell-associated antigens(7). Here we show that CD8 alpha(+) dendritic cells use CLEC9A (also known as DNGR-1), a recently-characterized C-type lectin(8-10), to recognize a preformed signal that is exposed on necrotic cells. Loss or blockade of CLEC9A does not impair the uptake of necrotic cell material by CD8 alpha(+) dendritic cells, but specifically reduces cross-presentation of dead-cell-associated antigens in vitro and decreases the immunogenicity of necrotic cells in vivo. The function of CLEC9A requires a key tyrosine residue in its intracellular tail that allows the recruitment and activation of the tyrosine kinase SYK, which is also essential for cross-presentation of dead-cell-associated antigens. Thus, CLEC9A functions as a SYK-coupled C-type lectin receptor to mediate sensing of necrosis by the principal dendritic-cell subset involved in regulating cross-priming to cell-associated antigens.","Sancho, David; Joffre, Olivier P.; Keller, Anna M.; Rogers, Neil C.; Martinez, Dolores; Hernanz-Falcon, Patricia; Rosewell, Ian; Reis e Sousa, Caetano","Sancho, D; Joffre, OP; Keller, AM; Rogers, NC; Martinez, D; Hernanz-Falcon, P; Rosewell, I; Sousa, CRE",899.0,"[Sancho, David; Joffre, Olivier P.; Keller, Anna M.; Rogers, Neil C.; Hernanz-Falcon, Patricia; Reis e Sousa, Caetano] Lincolns Inn Fields Labs, Immunobiol Lab, London WC2A 3PX, England; [Sancho, David; Joffre, Olivier P.; Keller, Anna M.; Rogers, Neil C.; Hernanz-Falcon, Patricia; Reis e Sousa, Caetano] Lincolns Inn Fields Labs, London Res Inst, Canc Res UK, FACS Lab, London WC2A 3PX, England; [Martinez, Dolores; Rosewell, Ian] Imperial Canc Res Fund, Clare Hall Labs, Canc Res UK, Trangen Serv, Potters Bar EN6 3LD, Herts, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07750,Article,,caetano@cancer.org.uk,903,Cancer Research UK; EMBO [ALTF 336-2004]; European Community [MEIF-CT-2005-009205],"This work was funded by Cancer Research UK.

The robust growth and unrestricted distribution of HeLa cells resulted in its broad adoption-both intentionally and through widespread cross-contamination(2)-and for the past 60 years it has served a role analogous to that of a model organism(3). The cumulative impact of the HeLa cell line on research is demonstrated by its occurrence in more than 74,000 PubMed abstracts (approximately 0.3%). The genomic architecture of HeLa remains largely unexplored beyond its karyotype(4), partly because like many cancers, its extensive aneuploidy renders such analyses challenging. We carried out haplotype-resolved whole-genome sequencing(5) of the HeLa CCL-2 strain, examined point-and indel-mutation variations, mapped copy-number variations and loss of heterozygosity regions, and phased variants across full chromosome arms. We also investigated variation and copy-number profiles for HeLa S3 and eight additional strains. We find that HeLa is relatively stable in terms of point variation, with few new mutations accumulating after early passaging. Haplotype resolution facilitated reconstruction of an amplified, highly rearranged region of chromosome 8q24.21 at which integration of the human papilloma virus type 18 (HPV-18) genome occurred and that is likely to be the event that initiated tumorigenesis. We combined these maps with RNA-seq(6) and ENCODE Project(7) data sets to phase the HeLa epigenome. This revealed strong, haplotype-specific activation of the proto-oncogene MYC by the integrated HPV-18 genome approximately 500 kilobases upstream, and enabled global analyses of the relationship between gene dosage and expression. These data provide an extensively phased, high-quality reference genome for past and future experiments relying on HeLa, and demonstrate the value of haplotype resolution for characterizing cancer genomes and epigenomes.","Adey, Andrew; Burton, Joshua N.; Kitzman, Jacob O.; Hiatt, Joseph B.; Lewis, Alexandra P.; Martin, Beth K.; Qiu, Ruolan; Lee, Choli; Shendure, Jay","Adey, A; Burton, JN; Kitzman, JO; Hiatt, JB; Lewis, AP; Martin, BK; Qiu, RL; Lee, C; Shendure, J",207.0,"[Adey, Andrew; Burton, Joshua N.; Kitzman, Jacob O.; Hiatt, Joseph B.; Lewis, Alexandra P.; Martin, Beth K.; Qiu, Ruolan; Lee, Choli; Shendure, Jay] Univ Washington, Dept Genome Sci, Seattle, WA 98115 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12064,Article,1476-4687,acadey@uw.edu; shendure@uw.edu,+,National Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) [HG006283]; National Cancer Institute [CA160080]; National Science Foundation [DGE-0718124]; NHGRI [T32HG000035]; National Institute of Aging [AG039173],"The genome sequence described in this paper was derived from a HeLa cell line.

146,333,16.0,"In mammals, enlargement of the heart during embryonic development is primarily dependent on the increase in cardiomyocyte numbers. Shortly after birth, however, cardiomyocytes stop proliferating and further growth of the myocardium occurs through hypertrophic enlargement of the existing myocytes. As a consequence of the minimal renewal of cardiomyocytes during adult life, repair of cardiac damage through myocardial regeneration is very limited. Here we show that the exogenous administration of selected microRNAs (miRNAs) markedly stimulates cardiomyocyte proliferation and promotes cardiac repair. We performed a high-content microscopy, high-throughput functional screening for human miRNAs that promoted neonatal cardiomyocyte proliferation using a whole-genome miRNA library. Forty miRNAs strongly increased both DNA synthesis and cytokinesis in neonatal mouse and rat cardiomyocytes. Two of these miRNAs (hsa-miR-590 and hsa-miR-199a) were further selected for testing and were shown to promote cell cycle re-entry of adult cardiomyocytes ex vivo and to promote cardiomyocyte proliferation in both neonatal and adult animals. After myocardial infarction in mice, these miRNAs stimulated marked cardiac regeneration and almost complete recovery of cardiac functional parameters. The miRNAs identified hold great promise for the treatment of cardiac pathologies consequent to cardiomyocyte loss.","Eulalio, Ana; Mano, Miguel; Dal Ferro, Matteo; Zentilin, Lorena; Sinagra, Gianfranco; Zacchigna, Serena; Giacca, Mauro","Eulalio, A; Mano, M; Dal Ferro, M; Zentilin, L; Sinagra, G; Zacchigna, S; Giacca, M",376.0,"[Eulalio, Ana; Mano, Miguel; Dal Ferro, Matteo; Zentilin, Lorena; Zacchigna, Serena; Giacca, Mauro] ICGEB, Mol Med Lab, I-34149 Trieste, Italy; [Dal Ferro, Matteo; Sinagra, Gianfranco] Univ Trieste, Dept Med Surg & Hlth Sci, Trieste, Italy; [Dal Ferro, Matteo; Sinagra, Gianfranco] Azienda Osped Univ Osped Riuniti Trieste, Ctr Translat Cardiol, I-34129 Trieste, Italy",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11739,Article,,giacca@icgeb.org,+,"FEBS Long Term Fellowship; European Research Council (ERC) [250124]; Project CTC from the Fondazione CRTrieste, Trieste, Italy","The authors are grateful to M.

147,211,87.0,"Non-invasive imaging deep into organs at microscopic scales remains an open quest in biomedical imaging. Although optical microscopy is still limited to surface imaging owing to optical wave diffusion and fast decorrelation in tissue, revolutionary approaches such as fluorescence photo-activated localization microscopy led to a striking increase in resolution by more than an order of magnitude in the last decade(1). In contrast with optics, ultrasonic waves propagate deep into organs without losing their coherence and are much less affected by in vivo decorrelation processes. However, their resolution is impeded by the fundamental limits of diffraction, which impose a long-standing trade-off between resolution and penetration. This limits clinical and preclinical ultrasound imaging to a sub-millimetre scale. Here we demonstrate in vivo that ultrasound imaging at ultrafast frame rates (more than 500 frames per second) provides an analogue to optical localization microscopy by capturing the transient signal decorrelation of contrast agents-inert gas microbubbles. Ultrafast ultrasound localization microscopy allowed both non-invasive sub-wavelength structural imaging and haemodynamic quantification of rodent cerebral microvessels (less than ten micrometres in diameter) more than ten millimetres below the tissue surface, leading to transcranial whole-brain imaging within short acquisition times (tens of seconds). After intravenous injection, single echoes from individual microbubbles were detected through ultrafast imaging. Their localization, not limited by diffraction, was accumulated over 75,000 images, yielding 1,000,000 events per coronal plane and statistically independent pixels of ten micrometres in size. Precise temporal tracking of microbubble positions allowed us to extract accurately in-plane velocities of the blood flow with a large dynamic range (from one millimetre per second to several centimetres per second). These results pave the way for deep non-invasive microscopy in animals and humans using ultrasound. We anticipate that ultrafast ultrasound localization microscopy may become an invaluable tool for the fundamental understanding and diagnostics of various disease processes that modify the microvascular blood flow, such as cancer, stroke and arteriosclerosis.","Errico, Claudia; Pierre, Juliette; Pezet, Sophie; Desailly, Yann; Lenkei, Zsolt; Couture, Olivier; Tanter, Mickael","Rrico, CE; Pierre, J; Pezet, S; Desailly, Y; Lenkei, Z; Couture, O; Tanter, M",499.0,"[Errico, Claudia; Pierre, Juliette; Desailly, Yann; Couture, Olivier; Tanter, Mickael] INSERM, Inst Langevin, F-75005 Paris, France; [Errico, Claudia; Pierre, Juliette; Desailly, Yann; Couture, Olivier; Tanter, Mickael] PSL Res Univ, ESPCI ParisTech, Inst Langevin, F-75005 Paris, France; [Errico, Claudia; Pierre, Juliette; Desailly, Yann; Couture, Olivier; Tanter, Mickael] CNRS, UMR 7587, F-75005 Paris, France; [Pezet, Sophie; Lenkei, Zsolt] CNRS, UMR 8249, F-75005 Paris, France; [Pezet, Sophie; Lenkei, Zsolt] PSL Res Univ, ESPCI ParisTech, Brain Plast Unit, F-75005 Paris, France",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature16066,Article,1476-4687,mickael.tanter@espci.fr,+,"Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR), within the project ANR MUSLI; Fondation Pierre-Gilles de Gennes; LABEX WIFI (Laboratory of Excellence) within the French Program ""Investments for the Future"" [ANR-10-LABX-24, ANR-10-IDEX-0001-02 PSL*]","This work was supported principally by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR), within the project ANR MUSLI.

148,366,392.0,"During progression of atherosclerosis, myeloid cells destabilize lipid-rich plaques in the arterial wall and cause their rupture, thus triggering myocardial infarction and stroke. Survivors of acute coronary syndromes have a high risk of recurrent events for unknown reasons. Here we show that the systemic response to ischaemic injury aggravates chronic atherosclerosis. After myocardial infarction or stroke, Apoe(-/-) mice developed larger atherosclerotic lesions with a more advanced morphology. This disease acceleration persisted over many weeks and was associated with markedly increased monocyte recruitment. Seeking the source of surplus monocytes in plaques, we found that myocardial infarction liberated haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from bone marrow niches via sympathetic nervous system signalling. The progenitors then seeded the spleen, yielding a sustained boost in monocyte production. These observations provide new mechanistic insight into atherogenesis and provide a novel therapeutic opportunity to mitigate disease progression.","Dutta, Partha; Courties, Gabriel; Wei, Ying; Leuschner, Florian; Gorbatov, Rostic; Robbins, Clinton S.; Iwamoto, Yoshiko; Thompson, Brian; Carlson, Alicia L.; Heidt, Timo; Majmudar, Maulik D.; Lasitschka, Felix; Etzrodt, Martin; Waterman, Peter; Waring, Michael T.; Chicoine, Adam T.; van der Laan, Anja M.; Niessen, Hans W.

149,331,4.0,"The control of the electric and optical properties of semiconductors with microwave fields forms the basis of modern electronics, information processing and optical communications. The extension of such control to optical frequencies calls for wideband materials such as dielectrics, which require strong electric fields to alter their physical properties(1-5). Few-cycle laser pulses permit damage-free exposure of dielectrics to electric fields of several volts per angstrom(6) and significant modifications in their electronic system(6-13). Fields of such strength and temporal confinement can turn a dielectric from an insulating state to a conducting state within the optical period(14). However, to extend electric signal control and processing to light frequencies depends on the feasibility of reversing these effects approximately as fast as they can be induced. Here we study the underlying electron processes with sub-femtosecond solid-state spectroscopy, which reveals the feasibility of manipulating the electronic structure and electric polarizability of a dielectric reversibly with the electric field of light. We irradiate a dielectric (fused silica) with a waveform-controlled near-infrared few-cycle light field of several volts per angstrom and probe changes in extreme-ultraviolet absorptivity and near-infrared reflectivity on a timescale of approximately a hundred attoseconds to a few femtoseconds. The field-induced changes follow, in a highly nonlinear fashion, the turn-on and turn-off behaviour of the driving field, in agreement with the predictions of a quantum mechanical model. The ultrafast reversibility of the effects implies that the physical properties of a dielectric can be controlled with the electric field of light, offering the potential for petahertz-bandwidth signal manipulation.","Schultze, Martin; Bothschafter, Elisabeth M.; Sommer, Annkatrin; Holzner, Simon; Schweinberger, Wolfgang; Fiess, Markus; Hofstetter, Michael; Kienberger, Reinhard; Apalkov, Vadym; Yakovlev, Vladislav S.; Stockman, Mark I.; Krausz, Ferenc","Schultze, M; Bothschafter, EM; Sommer, A; Holzner, S; Schweinberger, W; Fiess, M; Hofstetter, M; Kienberger, R; Apalkov, V; Yakovlev, VS; Stockman, MI; Krausz, F",75.0,"[Schultze, Martin; Bothschafter, Elisabeth M.; Sommer, Annkatrin; Holzner, Simon; Schweinberger, Wolfgang; Fiess, Markus; Kienberger, Reinhard; Krausz, Ferenc] Max Planck Inst Quantum Opt, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Schultze, Martin; Hofstetter, Michael; Yakovlev, Vladislav S.; Krausz, Ferenc] Univ Munich, Fak Phys, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Bothschafter, Elisabeth M.; Kienberger, Reinhard] Tech Univ Munich, Phys Dept, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Apalkov, Vadym; Stockman, Mark I.] Georgia State Univ, Dept Phys, Atlanta, GA 30340 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11720,Article,,martin.schultze@mpq.mpg.de; mstockman@gsu.edu; krausz@lmu.de,78,"Max Planck Society; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft Cluster of Excellence: Munich Centre for Advanced Photonics; Chemical Sciences, Biosciences and Geosciences Division [DEFG02-01ER15213]; Materials Sciences and Engineering Division of the Office of the Basic Energy Sciences, Office of Science, US Department of Energy [DE-FG02-11ER46789]","This work was supported by the Max Planck Society and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft Cluster of Excellence: Munich Centre for Advanced Photonics (www.munich-photonics.de).

Though the effect of knocking out or overexpressing a particular gene has been studied in many organisms, no study has systematically explored the effect of adding new links in a biological network. To explore network evolvability, we constructed 598 recombinations of promoters ( including regulatory regions) with different transcription or sigma-factor genes in Escherichia coli, added over a wild- type genetic background. Here we show that similar to 95% of new networks are tolerated by the bacteria, that very few alter growth, and that expression level correlates with factor position in the wild- type network hierarchy. Most importantly, we find that certain networks consistently survive over the wild type under various selection pressures.

Researchers in many disciplines have used large systems of coupled oscillators to model the behaviour of a diverse array of fluctuating systems in nature(1-4). In the well- studied regime of weak coupling, synchronization is favoured by increases in coupling strength and large- scale network structures ( for example 'small worlds') that produce short cuts and clustering(5-9). Here we show that, by contrast, randomizing the structure of dispersal networks in a model of predators and prey tends to favour asynchrony and prolonged transient dynamics, with resulting effects on the amplitudes of population fluctuations. Our results focus on synchronization and dynamics of clusters in models, and on time-scales, more appropriate for ecology, namely smaller systems with strong interactions outside the weak- coupling regime, rather than the better- studied cases of large, weakly coupled systems. In these smaller systems, the dynamics of transients and the effects of changes in connectivity can be well understood using a set of methods including numerical reconstructions of phase dynamics, examinations of cluster formation and the consideration of important aspects of cyclic dynamics, such as amplitude.","Holland, Matthew D.; Hastings, Alan","Holland, MD; Hastings, A",792.0,"[Holland, Matthew D.; Hastings, Alan] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07395,Article,,mdholland@ucdavis.edu,U76,Quantitative Environmental and Integrative Biology; National Science Foundation,We thank M.

152,312,286.0,"Type 1 pili, produced by uropathogenic Escherichia coli, are multi-subunit fibres crucial in recognition of and adhesion to host tissues(1). During pilus biogenesis, subunits are recruited to an outer membrane assembly platform, the FimD usher, which catalyses their polymerization and mediates pilus secretion(2). The recent determination of the crystal structure of an initiation complex provided insight into the initiation step of pilus biogenesis resulting in pore activation, but very little is known about the elongation steps that follow(3). Here, to address this question, we determine the structure of an elongation complex in which the tip complex assembly composed of FimC, FimF, FimG and FimH passes through FimD. This structure demonstrates the conformational changes required to prevent backsliding of the nascent pilus through the FimD pore and also reveals unexpected properties of the usher pore. We show that the circular binding interface between the pore lumen and the folded substrate participates in transport by defining a low-energy pathway along which the nascent pilus polymer is guided during secretion.","Geibel, Sebastian; Procko, Erik; Hultgren, Scott J.; Baker, David; Waksman, Gabriel","Geibel, S; Procko, E; Hultgren, SJ; Baker, D; Waksman, G",243.0,"[Geibel, Sebastian; Waksman, Gabriel] UCL, Inst Struct & Mol Biol, London WC1E 7HX, England; [Geibel, Sebastian; Waksman, Gabriel] Univ London Birkbeck Coll, London WC1E 7HX, England; [Procko, Erik; Baker, David] Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Procko, Erik; Baker, David] Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Hultgren, Scott J.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Womens Infect Dis Res, St Louis, MO 63011 USA; [Hultgren, Scott J.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol Microbiol, St Louis, MO 63011 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12007,Article,,dabaker@u.washington.edu; g.waksman@ucl.ac.uk,+,Medical Research Council [85602]; National Institute of General Medical Studies at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) [P41 GM103533]; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease at the NIH [AI029549],"This work was funded by Medical Research Council grant 85602 to G.
