0,133,301.0,"The causes and timing of tropical glacier fluctuations during the Holocene epoch (10,000 years ago to present) are poorly understood. Yet constraining their sensitivity to changes in climate(1) is important, as these glaciers are both sensitive indicators of climate change and serve as water reservoirs for highland regions(2). Studies have so far documented extra-tropical glacier fluctuations(3,4), but in the tropics, glacier-climate relationships are insufficiently understood. Here we present a (10)Be chronology for the past 11,000 years (11 kyr), using 57 moraines from the Bolivian Telata glacier (in the Cordillera Real mountain range). This chronology indicates that Telata glacier retreated irregularly. Arapid and strong melting from the maximum extent occurred from 10.8 +/- 0.9 to 8.5 +/- 0.4 kyr ago, followed by a slower retreat until the Little Ice Age, about 200 years ago. A dramatic increase in the rate of retreat occurred over the twentieth century. A glacier-climate model indicates that, relative to modern climate, annual mean temperature for the Telata glacier region was -3.3 +/- 0.8 degrees C cooler at 11 kyr ago and remained -2.1 +/- 0.8 degrees C cooler until the end of the Little Ice Age. We suggest that long-term warming of the eastern tropical Pacific and increased atmospheric temperature in response to enhanced austral summer insolation were the main drivers for the long-term Holocene retreat of glaciers in the southern tropics.","Jomelli, Vincent; Khodri, Myriam; Favier, Vincent; Brunstein, Daniel; Ledru, Marie-Pierre; Wagnon, Patrick; Blard, Pierre-Henri; Sicart, Jean-Emmanuel; Braucher, Regis; Grancher, Delphine; Bourles, Didier Louis; Braconnot, Pascale; Vuille, Mathias","Jomelli, V; Khodri, M; Favier, V; Brunstein, D; Ledru, MP; Wagnon, P; Blard, PH; Sicart, JE; Braucher, R; Grancher, D; Bourles, DL; Braconnot, P; Vuille, M",196.0,"[Jomelli, Vincent; Brunstein, Daniel; Grancher, Delphine] Univ Paris 01, CNRS, Lab Geog Phys, F-92195 Meudon, France; [Khodri, Myriam] IRD, IPSL, LOCEAN, F-75252 Paris 05, France; [Favier, Vincent] UJF, CNRS, LGGE, F-38402 St Martin Dheres, France; [Ledru, Marie-Pierre] UM2 CNRS IRD, ISEM, IRD UMR 226, F-34095 Montpellier, France; [Wagnon, Patrick; Sicart, Jean-Emmanuel] UJF Grenoble 1, CNRS, UMR 5183, IRD,G INP,LGGE,LTHE,UMR 5564, F-38402 Grenoble, France; [Blard, Pierre-Henri] Univ Lorraine, CNRS, UPR2300, CRPG, F-54501 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France; [Braucher, Regis; Bourles, Didier Louis] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, UMR 6635, CEREGE, F-13545 Aix En Provence, France; [Braconnot, Pascale] CEA Saclay, UVSQ, CNRS, CEA,Unite Mixte,Lab Sci Climat & Environm,IPSL, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Vuille, Mathias] SUNY Albany, Dept Atmospher & Environm Sci, Albany, NY 12222 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10150,Article,,jomelli@cnrs-bellevue.fr,199,"French INSU; French ANR [06-Vuln-010, 10-Blan-608-01]; INSU/CNRS; French Ministry of Research and Higher Education; IRD and CEA; CNRS; EU [EVK2-CT-2002-00153]; Programme National d'Etude de la Dynamique du Climate (PNEDC)","Financial support was provided by the French INSU programme 'LEVE', the French ANR Escarcel programme no. 06-Vuln-010, UR Great Ice at IRD, and the French ANR El Paso programme no. 10-Blan-608-01.

1,11,212.0,"Variation in transcriptional regulation is thought to be a major cause of phenotypic diversity(1,2). Although widespread differences in gene expression among individuals of a species have been observed(3-8), studies to examine the variability of transcription factor binding on a global scale have not been performed, and thus the extent and underlying genetic basis of transcription factor binding diversity is unknown. By mapping differences in transcription factor binding among individuals, here we present the genetic basis of such variation on a genome-wide scale. Whole-genome Ste12-binding profiles were determined using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with DNA sequencing in pheromone-treated cells of 43 segregants of a cross between two highly diverged yeast strains and their parental lines. We identified extensive Ste12-binding variation among individuals, and mapped underlying cis- and trans-acting loci responsible for such variation. We showed that most transcription factor binding variation is cis- linked, and that many variations are associated with polymorphisms residing in the binding motifs of Ste12 as well as those of several proposed Ste12 cofactors. We also identified two transfactors, AMN1 and FLO8, that modulate Ste12 binding to promoters of more than ten genes under alpha-factor treatment. Neither of these two genes was previously known to regulate Ste12, and we suggest that they may be mediators of gene activity and phenotypic diversity. Ste12 binding strongly correlates with gene expression for more than 200 genes, indicating that binding variation is functional. Many of the variable-bound genes are involved in cell wall organization and biogenesis. Overall, these studies identified genetic regulators of molecular diversity among individuals and provide new insights into mechanisms of gene regulation.","Zheng, Wei; Zhao, Hongyu; Mancera, Eugenio; Steinmetz, Lars M.; Snyder, Michael","Zheng, W; Zhao, HY; Mancera, E; Steinmetz, LM; Snyder, M",1187.0,"[Zheng, Wei; Snyder, Michael] Yale Univ, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Zhao, Hongyu] Yale Univ, Program Computat Biol & Bioinformat, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Zhao, Hongyu] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Mancera, Eugenio; Steinmetz, Lars M.] European Mol Biol Lab, Genome Biol Unit, Heidelberg, Germany; [Snyder, Michael] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08934,Article,,mpsnyder@stanford.edu,U106,National Institutes of Health (NIH) [RR19895],"We thank J.

An estimated two billion people suffer these deficiencies(1), causing a loss of 63 million life-years annually(2,3). Most of these people depend on C-3 grains and legumes as their primary dietary source of zinc and iron. Here we report that C-3 grains and legumes have lower concentrations of zinc and iron when grown under field conditions at the elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration predicted for the middle of this century. C-3 crops other than legumes also have lower concentrations of protein, whereas C-4 crops seem to be less affected. Differences between cultivars of a single crop suggest that breeding for decreased sensitivity to atmospheric CO2 concentration could partly address these new challenges to global health.","Myers, Samuel S.; Zanobetti, Antonella; Kloog, Itai; Huybers, Peter; Leakey, Andrew D.

3,124,262.0,"The manipulation of light-matter interactions by quantum control of atomic levels has had a profound impact on optical sciences. Such manipulation has many applications, including nonlinear optics at the few-photon level(1-3), slow light(4,5), lasing without inversion(6-8) and optical quantum information processing(9,10). The critical underlying technique is electromagnetically induced transparency, in which quantum interference between transitions in multilevel atoms(11-15) renders an opaque medium transparent near an atomic resonance. With the advent of high-brilliance, accelerator-driven light sources such as storage rings or X-ray lasers, it has become attractive to extend the techniques of optical quantum control to the X-ray regime(16,17). Here we demonstrate electromagnetically induced transparency in the regime of hard X-rays, using the 14.4-kiloelectronvolt nuclear resonance of the Mossbauer isotope iron-57 (a two-level system). We exploit cooperative emission from ensembles of the nuclei, which are embedded in a low-finesse cavity and excited by synchrotron radiation. The spatial modulation of the photonic density of states in a cavity mode leads to the coexistence of superradiant and subradiant states of nuclei, respectively located at an antinode and a node of the cavity field. This scheme causes the nuclei to behave as effective three-level systems, with two degenerate levels in the excited state (one of which can be considered metastable). The radiative coupling of the nuclear ensembles by the cavity field establishes the atomic coherence necessary for the cancellation of resonant absorption. Because this technique does not require atomic systems with a metastable level, electromagnetically induced transparency and its applications can be transferred to the regime of nuclear resonances, establishing the field of nuclear quantum optics.","Roehlsberger, Ralf; Wille, Hans-Christian; Schlage, Kai; Sahoo, Balaram","Rohlsberger, R; Wille, HC; Schlage, K; Sahoo, B",199.0,"[Roehlsberger, Ralf; Wille, Hans-Christian; Schlage, Kai; Sahoo, Balaram] Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron, D-22607 Hamburg, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10741,Article,1476-4687,ralf.roehlsberger@desy.de,203,,,888HI,,,POPULATION-INVERSION; LASER OSCILLATION; ATOMIC GAS; OPTICS,7384.0,NATURE,Nature,English,29.0,No,"Sahoo, Balaram/0000-0002-2050-4746; Rohlsberger, Ralf/0000-0001-6005-5183; Wille, Hans-Christian/0000-0003-0851-3831","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",9-Feb,5.0,LONDON,22318603.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2012.0,"Sahoo, Balaram/E-4828-2011; Wille, Hans-Christian/C-3881-2013; Rohlsberger, Ralf/J-4173-2013","Rohlsberger, R (reprint author), Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron, Notkestr 85, D-22607 Hamburg, Germany.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,80.0,Electromagnetically induced transparency with resonant nuclei in a cavity,3.0,63.0,WOS:000299994100034,262.0,482,Multidisciplinary Sciences,80,balaram,sahoo,806.0,3,male,1.0,6cDBwBEAAAAJ,1,"[0, 1474]",44231522,1,4773382,1,Orthosilicate (ion),Orthosilicate (ion),0,0
4,84,338.0,"The evolution of serially arranged, jointed endoskeletal supports internal to the gills-the visceral branchial arches-represents one of the key events in early jawed vertebrate (gnathostome) history, because it provided the morphological basis for the subsequent evolution of jaws. However, until now little was known about visceral arches in early gnathostomes, and theories about gill arch evolution were driven by information gleaned mostly from both modern cartilaginous (chondrichthyan) and bony (osteichthyan) fishes. New fossil discoveries can profoundly affect our understanding of evolutionary history, by revealing hitherto unseen combinations of primitive and derived characters. Here we describe a 325 million year (Myr)-old Palaeozoic shark-like fossil that represents, to our knowledge, the earliest identified chondrichthyan in which the complete gill skeleton is three-dimensionally preserved in its natural position. Its visceral arch arrangement is remarkably osteichthyan-like, suggesting that this may represent the common ancestral condition for crown gnathostomes. Our findings thus reinterpret the polarity of some arch features of the crown jawed vertebrates and invert the classic hypothesis, in which modern sharks retain the ancestral condition. This study underscores the importance of early chondrichthyans in resolving the evolutionary history of jawed vertebrates.","Pradel, Alan; Maisey, John G.; Tafforeau, Paul; Mapes, Royal H.; Mallatt, Jon","Pradel, A; Maisey, JG; Tafforeau, P; Mapes, RH; Mallatt, J",608.0,"[Pradel, Alan; Maisey, John G.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Dept Vertebrate Paleontol, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Tafforeau, Paul] European Synchrotron Radiat Facil, F-38043 Grenoble, France; [Mapes, Royal H.] Ohio Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Athens, OH 45701 USA; [Mallatt, Jon] Washington State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13195,Article,1476-4687,apradel@amnh.org; maisey@amnh.org,+,H.

5,96,165.0,"Understanding the origins of the diversity in terrestrial planets is a fundamental goal in Earth and planetary sciences. In the Solar System, Venus has a similar size and bulk composition to those of Earth, but it lacks water(1-3). Because a richer variety of exoplanets is expected to be discovered, prediction of their atmospheres and surface environments requires a general framework for planetary evolution. Here we show that terrestrial planets can be divided into two distinct types on the basis of their evolutionary history during solidification from the initially hot molten state expected from the standard formation model(4,5). Even if, apart from their orbits, they were identical just after formation, the solidified planets can have different characteristics. A type I planet, which is formed beyond a certain critical distance from the host star, solidifies within several million years. If the planet acquires water during formation, most of this water is retained and forms the earliest oceans. In contrast, on a type II planet, which is formed inside the critical distance, a magma ocean can be sustained for longer, even with a larger initial amount of water. Its duration could be as long as 100 million years if the planet is formed together with a mass of water comparable to the total inventory of the modern Earth. Hydrodynamic escape desiccates type II planets during the slow solidification process. Although Earth is categorized as type I, it is not clear which type Venus is because its orbital distance is close to the critical distance. However, because the dryness of the surface and mantle predicted for type II planets is consistent with the characteristics of Venus, it may be representative of type II planets. Also, future observations may have a chance to detect not only terrestrial exoplanets covered with water ocean but also those covered with magma ocean around a young star.","Hamano, Keiko; Abe, Yutaka; Genda, Hidenori","Hamano, K; Abe, Y; Genda, H",607.0,"[Hamano, Keiko; Abe, Yutaka; Genda, Hidenori] Univ Tokyo, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Genda, Hidenori] Tokyo Inst Technol, Earth Life Sci Inst, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1528551, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12163,Article,,keiko@eps.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp,+,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology [23103003]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [23340168, 22740291]","We thank J.F.

6,109,258.0,"Epigenetic information is frequently erased near the start of each new generation(1). In some cases, however, epigenetic information can be transmitted from parent to progeny (multigenerational epigenetic inheritance)(2). A particularly notable example of this type of epigenetic inheritance is double-stranded RNA-mediated gene silencing in Caenorhabditis elegans. This RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) can be inherited for more than five generations(3-8). To understand this process, here we conduct a genetic screen for nematodes defective in transmitting RNAi silencing signals to future generations. This screen identified the heritable RNAi defective 1 (hrde-1) gene. hrde-1 encodes an Argonaute protein that associates with small interfering RNAs in the germ cells of progeny of animals exposed to double-stranded RNA. In the nuclei of these germ cells, HRDE-1 engages the nuclear RNAi defective pathway to direct the trimethylation of histone H3 at Lys 9 (H3K9me3) at RNAi-targeted genomic loci and promote RNAi inheritance. Under normal growth conditions, HRDE-1 associates with endogenously expressed short interfering RNAs, which direct nuclear gene silencing in germ cells. In hrde-1- or nuclear RNAi-deficient animals, germline silencing is lost over generational time. Concurrently, these animals exhibit steadily worsening defects in gamete formation and function that ultimately lead to sterility. These results establish that the Argonaute protein HRDE-1 directs gene-silencing events in germ-cell nuclei that drive multigenerational RNAi inheritance and promote immortality of the germ-cell lineage. We propose that C. elegans use the RNAi inheritance machinery to transmit epigenetic information, accrued by past generations, into future generations to regulate important biological processes.","Buckley, Bethany A.; Burkhart, Kirk B.; Gu, Sam Guoping; Spracklin, George; Kershner, Aaron; Fritz, Heidi; Kimble, Judith; Fire, Andrew; Kennedy, Scott","Buckley, BA; Burkhart, KB; Gu, SG; Spracklin, G; Kershner, A; Fritz, H; Kimble, J; Fire, A; Kennedy, S",447.0,"[Buckley, Bethany A.; Burkhart, Kirk B.; Spracklin, George; Fritz, Heidi; Kimble, Judith; Kennedy, Scott] Univ Wisconsin, Lab Genet, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Gu, Sam Guoping; Fire, Andrew] Stanford Univ, Dept Pathol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Gu, Sam Guoping; Fire, Andrew] Stanford Univ, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kershner, Aaron; Fritz, Heidi] Univ Wisconsin, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Kershner, Aaron; Kimble, Judith] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biochem, Madison, WI 53706 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11352,Article,,sgkennedy@wisc.edu,451,"Pew scholar's program; Shaw scholar's program; National Institutes of Health [GM88289, GM37706, GM069454]","We thank P.

7,92,356.0,"Temporal changes in the Earth's magnetic field, known as geomagnetic secular variation, occur most prominently at low latitudes in the Atlantic hemisphere(1,2) (that is, from 290 degrees east to 90 degrees east), whereas in the Pacific hemisphere there is comparatively little activity. This is a consequence of the geographical localization of intense, westward drifting, equatorial magnetic flux patches at the core surface(3). Despite successes in explaining the morphology of the geomagnetic field(4), numerical models of the geodynamo have so far failed to account systematically for this striking pattern of geomagnetic secular variation. Here we show that it can be reproduced provided that two mechanisms relying on the inner core are jointly considered. First, gravitational coupling(5) aligns the inner core with the mantle, forcing the flow of liquid metal in the outer core into a giant, westward drifting, sheet-like gyre(6). The resulting shear concentrates azimuthal magnetic flux at low latitudes close to the core-mantle boundary, where it is expelled by core convection and subsequently transported westward. Second, differential inner-core growth(7,8), fastest below Indonesia(6,9), causes an asymmetric buoyancy release in the outer core which in turn distorts the gyre, forcing it to become eccentric, in agreement with recent core flow inversions(6,10,11). This bottom-up heterogeneous driving of core convection dominates top-down driving from mantle thermal heterogeneities, and localizes magnetic variations in a longitudinal sector centred beneath the Atlantic, where the eccentric gyre reaches the core surface. To match the observed pattern of geomagnetic secular variation, the solid material forming the inner core must now be in a state of differential growth rather than one of growth and melting induced by convective translation(7,8).","Aubert, Julien; Finlay, Christopher C.; Fournier, Alexandre","Aubert, J; Finlay, CC; Fournier, A",219.0,"[Aubert, Julien; Fournier, Alexandre] Univ Paris Diderot, Inst Phys Globe Paris, Sorbonne Paris Cite, UMR 7154,CNRS, F-75005 Paris, France; [Finlay, Christopher C.] Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Space Inst, Div Geomagnetism, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12574,Article,1476-4687,aubert@ipgp.fr,+,"French Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-2011-BS56-011]; GENCI-IDRIS [2012-042122, 2013-042122]","This work was supported by the French Agence Nationale de la Recherche (grant ANR-2011-BS56-011).

8,78,157.0,"During glacial periods of the Late Pleistocene, an abundance of proxy data demonstrates the existence of large and repeated millennial-scale warming episodes, known as Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events(1). This ubiquitous feature of rapid glacial climate change can be extended back as far as 800,000 years before present (BP) in the ice core record(2), and has drawn broad attention within the science and policy-making communities alike(3). Many studies have been dedicated to investigating the underlying causes of these changes, but no coherent mechanism has yet been identified(3-15). Here we show, by using a comprehensive fully coupled model(16), that gradual changes in the height of the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets (NHISs) canalter the coupled atmosphere ocean system and cause rapid glacial climate shifts closely resembling DO events. The simulated global climate responses-including abrupt warming in the North Atlantic, a northward shift of the tropical rain-belts, and Southern Hemisphere cooling related to the bipolar seesa ware generally consistent with empirical evidence(1,3,17). As a result of the coexistence of two glacial ocean circulation states at intermediate heights of the ice sheets, minor changes in the height of the NHISs and the amount of atmospheric CO2 can trigger the rapid climate transitions via a local positive atmosphere-ocean-sea-ice feedback in the North Atlantic. Our results, although based on a single model, thus provide a coherent concept for understanding the recorded millennial scale variability and abrupt climate changes in the coupled atmosphere ocean system, as well as their linkages to the volume of the intermediate ice sheets during glacials.","Zhang, Xu; Lohmann, Gerrit; Knorr, Gregor; Purcell, Conor","Zhang, X; Lohmann, G; Knorr, G; Purcell, C",290.0,"[Zhang, Xu; Lohmann, Gerrit; Knorr, Gregor; Purcell, Conor] Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Alfred Wegener Inst, D-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany; [Lohmann, Gerrit] Univ Bremen, MARUM Ctr Marine Environm Sci, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Knorr, Gregor; Purcell, Conor] Cardiff Univ, Sch Earth & Ocean Sci, Cardiff CF10 3AT, S Glam, Wales",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13592,Article,1476-4687,xu.zhang@awi.de,+,"Polar Regions and Coasts in the Changing Earth System (PACES) programme of the AWI; 'Helmholtz Climate Initiative REKLIM' (Regional Climate Change), a joint research project of the Helmholtz Association of German research centres (HGF)","We thank the colleagues in the Paleoclimate Dynamics group at the Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI) in Bremerhaven for useful discussions, and I.

9,38,294.0,"The extinct placoderm fishes were the dominant group of vertebrates throughout the Middle Palaeozoic era(1), yet controversy about their relationships within the gnathostomes ( jawed vertebrates) is partly due to different interpretations of their reproductive biology(2-5). Here we document the oldest record of a live- bearing vertebrate in a new ptyctodontid placoderm, Materpiscis attenboroughi gen. et sp. nov., from the Late Devonian Gogo Formation of Australia ( approximately 380 million years ago)(6). The new specimen, remarkably preserved in three dimensions, contains a single, intra- uterine embryo connected by a permineralized umbilical cord. An amorphous crystalline mass near the umbilical cord possibly represents the recrystallized yolk sac. Another ptyctodont from the Gogo Formation, Austroptyctodus gardineri(7), also shows three small embryos inside it in the same position. Ptyctodontids have already provided the oldest definite evidence for vertebrate copulation(8), and the new specimens confirm that some placoderms had a remarkably advanced reproductive biology, comparable to that of some modern sharks and rays. The new discovery points to internal fertilization and viviparity in vertebrates as originating earliest within placoderms.","Long, John A.; Trinajstic, Kate; Young, Gavin C.; Senden, Tim","Long, JA; Trinajstic, K; Young, GC; Senden, T",650.0,"[Long, John A.] Museum Victoria, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia; [Long, John A.; Young, Gavin C.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Long, John A.] Monash Univ, Sch Geosci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Trinajstic, Kate] Univ Western Australia, Sch Earth & Geog Sci, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Senden, Tim] Australian Natl Univ, Dept Appl Math, Res Sch Phys Sci & Engn, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06966,Article,,jlong@museum.vic.gov.au,U6,,,305NN,,,X-RAY TOMOGRAPHY; VIVIPARITY; FISH,7195.0,NATURE,Nature,English,17.0,No,"Senden, Tim/0000-0001-6808-7219; Long, John/0000-0001-8012-0114; Trinajstic, Kate/0000-0002-6519-6396","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",29-May,4.0,LONDON,18509443.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,"Trinajstic, Kate/B-2537-2009; Senden, Tim/A-7319-2008","Long, JA (reprint author), Museum Victoria, POB 666, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,56.0,Live birth in the Devonian period,4.0,33.0,WOS:000256185200043,294.0,453,Multidisciplinary Sciences,59,tim,senden,110.0,2949,male,0.99,S0tR7LoAAAAJ,1,"[0, 1474]",1506194,1,1506194,1,Steropodontidae,Steropodontidae,0,0
10,121,153.0,"Understanding the dynamics of correlated many-body quantum systems is a challenge for modern physics. Owing to the simplicity of theirHamiltonians, He-4 (bosons) and He-3 (fermions) have served as model systems for strongly interacting quantum fluids, with substantial efforts devoted to their understanding. An important milestone was the direct observation of the collective phonon-roton mode in liquid He-4 by neutron scattering, verifying Landau's prediction(1) and his fruitful concept of elementary excitations. In a Fermi system, collective density fluctuations (known as 'zero-sound' in He-3, and 'plasmons' in charged systems) and incoherent particle-hole excitations are observed. At small wavevectors and energies, both types of excitation are described by Landau's theory of Fermi liquids(2,3). At higher wavevectors, the collectivemode enters the particle-hole band, where it is strongly damped. The dynamics of Fermi liquids at high wavevectors was thus believed to be essentially incoherent. Here we report inelastic neutron scattering measurements of a monolayer of liquid He-3, observing a roton-like excitation. We find that the collective density mode reappears as a well defined excitation atmomentum transfers larger than twice the Fermi momentum. We thus observe unexpected collective behaviour of a Fermi many-body system in the regime beyond the scope of Landau's theory. A satisfactory interpretation of the measured spectra is obtained using a dynamic many-body theory(4).","Godfrin, Henri; Meschke, Matthias; Lauter, Hans-Jochen; Sultan, Ahmad; Boehm, Helga M.; Krotscheck, Eckhard; Panholzer, Martin","Godfrin, H; Meschke, M; Lauter, HJ; Sultan, A; Bohm, HM; Krotscheck, E; Panholzer, M",576.0,"[Godfrin, Henri; Meschke, Matthias; Sultan, Ahmad] CNRS, Inst Neel, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France; [Godfrin, Henri; Meschke, Matthias; Sultan, Ahmad] Univ Grenoble 1, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France; [Meschke, Matthias] Aalto Univ, Low Temp Lab, Aalto 00076, Finland; [Lauter, Hans-Jochen] Inst Laue Langevin, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France; [Lauter, Hans-Jochen] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Boehm, Helga M.; Krotscheck, Eckhard; Panholzer, Martin] Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Inst Theoret Phys, A-4040 Linz, Austria; [Krotscheck, Eckhard] SUNY Buffalo, Dept Phys, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10919,Article,,henri.godfrin@grenoble.cnrs.fr,579,Austrian Fonds zur Forderung der wissenschaftlichen Forschung (FWF) [P21264]; French Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-2010-INTB-403-01]; EU [228464],"We are grateful to the Austrian-French programme Amadeus for providing initial support; to the Austrian Fonds zur Forderung der wissenschaftlichen Forschung (FWF grant P21264), the French Agence Nationale de la Recherche (project ANR-2010-INTB-403-01) and the EU FRP7 low-temperature infrastructure grant Microkelvin (project number 228464) for funding this research; and to the Institut Laue-Langevin for use of the facility.",915EF,,,ELEMENTARY EXCITATIONS; EFFECTIVE-MASS; NEUTRON-SCATTERING; SPIN FLUCTUATIONS; ZERO SOUND; HE-3; FILMS; PLASMONS; GRAPHITE; DYNAMICS,7391.0,NATURE,Nature,English,31.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",29-Mar,4.0,LONDON,22460903.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2012.0,"Meschke, Matthias/G-5166-2012","Godfrin, H (reprint author), CNRS, Inst Neel, BP 166, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,17.0,Observation of a roton collective mode in a two-dimensional Fermi liquid,5.0,40.0,WOS:000302006100034,153.0,483,Multidisciplinary Sciences,17,martin,panholzer,118.0,3568,male,1.0,oDRnEUgAAAAJ,1,"[0, 1474]",143848,1,143848,1,List of suicides,List of suicides,0,0
11,94,87.0,"Gene expression differs among individuals and populations and is thought to be a major determinant of phenotypic variation. Although variation and genetic loci responsible for RNA expression levels have been analysed extensively in human populations(1-5), our knowledge is limited regarding the differences in human protein abundance and the genetic basis for this difference. Variation in messenger RNA expression is not a perfect surrogate for protein expression because the latter is influenced by an array of post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, and, empirically, the correlation between protein and mRNA levels is generally modest(6,7). Here we used isobaric tag-based quantitative mass spectrometry to determine relative protein levels of 5,953 genes in lymphoblastoid cell lines from 95 diverse individuals genotyped in the HapMap Project(8,9). We found that protein levels are heritable molecular phenotypes that exhibit considerable variation between individuals, populations and sexes. Levels of specific sets of proteins involved in the same biological process covary among individuals, indicating that these processes are tightly regulated at the protein level. We identified cis-pQTLs (protein quantitative trait loci), including variants not detected by previous transcriptome studies. This study demonstrates the feasibility of high-throughput human proteome quantification that, when integrated with DNA variation and transcriptome information, adds a new dimension to the characterization of gene expression regulation.","Wu, Linfeng; Candille, Sophie I.; Choi, Yoonha; Xie, Dan; Jiang, Lihua; Li-Pook-Than, Jennifer; Tang, Hua; Snyder, Michael","Wu, LF; Candille, SI; Choi, Y; Xie, D; Jiang, LH; Li-Pook-Than, J; Tang, H; Snyder, M",79.0,"[Wu, Linfeng; Candille, Sophie I.; Choi, Yoonha; Xie, Dan; Jiang, Lihua; Li-Pook-Than, Jennifer; Tang, Hua; Snyder, Michael] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12223,Article,,huatang@stanford.edu; mpsnyder@stanford.edu,82,NIH,We thank S.

12,4,373.0,"The development of the human cerebral cortex is an orchestrated process involving the generation of neural progenitors in the periventricular germinal zones, cell proliferation characterized by symmetric and asymmetric mitoses, followed by migration of post-mitotic neurons to their final destinations in six highly ordered, functionally specialized layers(1,2). An understanding of the molecular mechanisms guiding these intricate processes is in its infancy, substantially driven by the discovery of rare mutations that cause malformations of cortical development(3-6). Mapping of disease loci in putative Mendelian forms of malformations of cortical development has been hindered by marked locus heterogeneity, small kindred sizes and diagnostic classifications that may not reflect molecular pathogenesis. Here we demonstrate the use of whole-exome sequencing to overcome these obstacles by identifying recessive mutations in WD repeat domain 62 (WDR62) as the cause of a wide spectrum of severe cerebral cortical malformations including microcephaly, pachygyria with cortical thickening as well as hypoplasia of the corpus callosum. Some patients with mutations in WDR62 had evidence of additional abnormalities including lissencephaly, schizencephaly, polymicrogyria and, in one instance, cerebellar hypoplasia, all traits traditionally regarded as distinct entities. In mice and humans, WDR62 transcripts and protein are enriched in neural progenitors within the ventricular and subventricular zones. Expression of WDR62 in the neocortex is transient, spanning the period of embryonic neurogenesis. Unlike other known microcephaly genes, WDR62 does not apparently associate with centrosomes and is predominantly nuclear in localization. These findings unify previously disparate aspects of cerebral cortical development and highlight the use of whole-exome sequencing to identify disease loci in settings in which traditional methods have proved challenging.","Bilguvar, Kaya; Ozturk, Ali Kemal; Louvi, Angeliki; Kwan, Kenneth Y.; Choi, Murim; Tatli, Burak; Yalnizoglu, Dilek; Tuysuz, Beyhan; Caglayan, Ahmet Okay; Gokben, Sarenur; Kaymakcalan, Hande; Barak, Tanyeri; Bakircioglu, Mehmet; Yasuno, Katsuhito; Ho, Winson; Sanders, Stephan; Zhu, Ying; Yilmaz, Sanem; Dincer, Alp; Johnson, Michele H.; Bronen, Richard A.; Kocer, Naci; Per, Hueseyin; Mane, Shrikant; Pamir, Mehmet Necmettin; Yalcinkaya, Cengiz; Kumandas, Sefer; Topcu, Meral; Ozmen, Meral; Sestan, Nenad; Lifton, Richard P.; State, Matthew W.; Gunel, Murat","Bilguvar, K; Ozturk, AK; Louvi, A; Kwan, KY; Choi, M; Tatli, B; Yalnizoglu, D; Tuysuz, B; Caglayan, AO; Gokben, S; Kaymakcalan, H; Barak, T; Bakircioglu, M; Yasuno, K; Ho, W; Sanders, S; Zhu, Y; Yilmaz, S; Dincer, A; Johnson, MH; Bronen, RA; Kocer, N; Per, H; Mane, S; Pamir, MN; Yalcinkaya, C; Kumandas, S; Topcu, M; Ozmen, M; Sestan, N; Lifton, RP; State, MW; Gunel, M",207.0,"[Bilguvar, Kaya; Ozturk, Ali Kemal; Louvi, Angeliki; Choi, Murim; Barak, Tanyeri; Bakircioglu, Mehmet; Yasuno, Katsuhito; Ho, Winson; Sanders, Stephan; Mane, Shrikant; Lifton, Richard P.; State, Matthew W.; Gunel, Murat] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Ctr Human Genet & Genom, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Bilguvar, Kaya; Ozturk, Ali Kemal; Louvi, Angeliki; Choi, Murim; Barak, Tanyeri; Bakircioglu, Mehmet; Yasuno, Katsuhito; Ho, Winson; Sanders, Stephan; Mane, Shrikant; Lifton, Richard P.; State, Matthew W.; Gunel, Murat] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Program Neurogenet, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Bilguvar, Kaya; Ozturk, Ali Kemal; Louvi, Angeliki; Barak, Tanyeri; Bakircioglu, Mehmet; Yasuno, Katsuhito; Ho, Winson; Johnson, Michele H.; Bronen, Richard A.; Gunel, Murat] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosurg, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Bilguvar, Kaya; Ozturk, Ali Kemal; Louvi, Angeliki; Kwan, Kenneth Y.; Barak, Tanyeri; Bakircioglu, Mehmet; Yasuno, Katsuhito; Ho, Winson; Zhu, Ying; Sestan, Nenad; Gunel, Murat] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Kwan, Kenneth Y.; Zhu, Ying; Sestan, Nenad] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Kavli Inst Neurosci, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Tatli, Burak; Ozmen, Meral] Istanbul Univ, Istanbul Fac Med, Dept Pediat, Div Neurol, TR-34093 Istanbul, Turkey; [Yalnizoglu, Dilek; Topcu, Meral] Hacettepe Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Div Neurol, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey; [Tuysuz, Beyhan] Istanbul Univ, Cerrahpasa Fac Med, Dept Pediat, Div Genet, TR-34098 Istanbul, Turkey; [Caglayan, Ahmet Okay] Kayseri Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Med Genet, TR-38010 Kayseri, Turkey; [Gokben, Sarenur; Yilmaz, Sanem] Ege Univ, Fac Med, Dept Pediat, Div Neurol, TR-35100 Izmir, Turkey; [Kaymakcalan, Hande] Bahcesehir Univ, Fac Arts & Sci, TR-34353 Istanbul, Turkey; [Sanders, Stephan; State, Matthew W.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Sanders, Stephan; State, Matthew W.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Child Study, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Dincer, Alp] Acibadem Univ, Sch Med, Dept Radiol, TR-34742 Istanbul, Turkey; [Johnson, Michele H.; Bronen, Richard A.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Radiol, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Johnson, Michele H.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Otolaryngol, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Kocer, Naci] Istanbul Univ, Cerrahpasa Fac Med, Dept Radiol, TR-34098 Istanbul, Turkey; [Per, Hueseyin; Kumandas, Sefer] Erciyes Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Div Neurol, TR-38039 Kayseri, Turkey; [Mane, Shrikant] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Yale Ctr Genome Anal, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Pamir, Mehmet Necmettin] Acibadem Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosurg, TR-34742 Istanbul, Turkey; [Yalcinkaya, Cengiz] Istanbul Univ, Cerrahpasa Fac Med, Dept Neurol, Div Child Neurol, TR-34098 Istanbul, Turkey; [Lifton, Richard P.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New Haven, CT 06510 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09327,Article,,richard.lifton@yale.edu; matthew.state@yale.edu; murat.gunel@yale.edu,U93,"Yale Program on Neurogenetics; Yale Center for Human Genetics and Genomics; National Institutes of Health [RC2 NS070477, UL1 RR024139NIH, UO1MH081896]; National Institutes of Health Neuroscience Microarray Consortium [U24 NS051869-02S1]","We are indebted to the patients and families who have contributed to this study.

13,30,392.0,"DNA sequence information underpins genetic research, enabling discoveries of important biological or medical benefit. Sequencing projects have traditionally used long ( 400 - 800 base pair) reads, but the existence of reference sequences for the human and many other genomes makes it possible to develop new, fast approaches to re- sequencing, whereby shorter reads are compared to a reference to identify intraspecies genetic variation. Here we report an approach that generates several billion bases of accurate nucleotide sequence per experiment at low cost. Single molecules of DNA are attached to a flat surface, amplified in situ and used as templates for synthetic sequencing with fluorescent reversible terminator deoxyribonucleotides. Images of the surface are analysed to generate high- quality sequence. We demonstrate application of this approach to human genome sequencing on flow- sorted X chromosomes and then scale the approach to determine the genome sequence of a male Yoruba from Ibadan, Nigeria. We build an accurate consensus sequence from. 303 average depth of paired 35- base reads. We characterize four million single- nucleotide polymorphisms and four hundred thousand structural variants, many of which were previously unknown. Our approach is effective for accurate, rapid and economical whole- genome re- sequencing and many other biomedical applications.","Bentley, David R.; Balasubramanian, Shankar; Swerdlow, Harold P.; Smith, Geoffrey P.; Milton, John; Brown, Clive G.; Hall, Kevin P.; Evers, Dirk J.; Barnes, Colin L.; Bignell, Helen R.; Boutell, Jonathan M.; Bryant, Jason; Carter, Richard J.; Cheetham, R.

14,35,80.0,"The E2F family is conserved from Caenorhabditis elegans to mammals, with some family members having transcription activation functions and others having repressor functions(1,2). Whereas C. elegans(3) and Drosophila melanogaster(4,5) have a single E2F activator protein and repressor protein, mammals have at least three activator and five repressor proteins(1,2,6). Why such genetic complexity evolved in mammals is not known. To begin to evaluate this genetic complexity, we targeted the inactivation of the entire subset of activators, E2f1, E2f2, E2f3a and E2f3b, singly or in combination in mice. We demonstrate that E2f3a is sufficient to support mouse embryonic and postnatal development. Remarkably, expression of E2f3b or E2f1 from the E2f3a locus ( E2f3a(3bki) or E2f3a(1ki), respectively) suppressed all the postnatal phenotypes associated with the inactivation of E2f3a. We conclude that there is significant functional redundancy among activators and that the specific requirement for E2f3a during postnatal development is dictated by regulatory sequences governing its selective spatiotemporal expression and not by its intrinsic protein functions. These findings provide a molecular basis for the observed specificity among E2F activators during development.","Tsai, Shih-Yin; Opavsky, Rene; Sharma, Nidhi; Wu, Lizhao; Naidu, Shan; Nolan, Eric; Feria-Arias, Enrique; Timmers, Cynthia; Opavska, Jana; de Bruin, Alain; Chong, Jean-Leon; Trikha, Prashant; Fernandez, Soledad A.; Stromberg, Paul; Rosol, Thomas J.; Leone, Gustavo","Tsai, SY; Opavsky, R; Sharma, N; Wu, LZ; Naidu, S; Nolan, E; Feria-Arias, E; Timmers, C; Opavska, J; de Bruin, A; Chong, JL; Trikha, P; Fernandez, SA; Stromberg, P; Rosol, TJ; Leone, G",1137.0,"[Tsai, Shih-Yin; Opavsky, Rene; Sharma, Nidhi; Wu, Lizhao; Nolan, Eric; Feria-Arias, Enrique; Timmers, Cynthia; Opavska, Jana; de Bruin, Alain; Chong, Jean-Leon; Trikha, Prashant; Leone, Gustavo] Ohio State Univ, Dept Mol Genet, Coll Biol Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Tsai, Shih-Yin; Opavsky, Rene; Sharma, Nidhi; Wu, Lizhao; Naidu, Shan; Nolan, Eric; Feria-Arias, Enrique; Timmers, Cynthia; Opavska, Jana; de Bruin, Alain; Chong, Jean-Leon; Trikha, Prashant; Leone, Gustavo] Ohio State Univ, Ctr Comprehens Canc, Human Canc Genet Program, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Tsai, Shih-Yin; Opavsky, Rene; Sharma, Nidhi; Wu, Lizhao; Naidu, Shan; Nolan, Eric; Feria-Arias, Enrique; Timmers, Cynthia; Opavska, Jana; de Bruin, Alain; Chong, Jean-Leon; Trikha, Prashant; Leone, Gustavo] Ohio State Univ, Dept Mol Virol Immunol & Med Genet, Coll Med, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Naidu, Shan; Stromberg, Paul; Rosol, Thomas J.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Vet Biosci, Coll Vet Med, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Fernandez, Soledad A.] Ohio State Univ, Ctr Biostat, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07066,Article,,Gustavo.Leone@osumc.edu,U69,"NIH [R01CA85619, R01HD042619, R01CA121275, R01HD047470, P01CA097189, K01CA102328]; DoD awards [BC0300893, BC061730]; T32 fellowship [CA106196]; Pew Charitable Trusts Scholar Award; Leukemia and Lymphoma Society Scholar Award","We thank J.

15,86,406.0,"Tropical forests are global epicentres of biodiversity and important modulators of climate change(1), and are mainly constrained by rainfall patterns(1-3). The severe short-term droughts that occurred recently in Amazonia have drawn attention to the vulnerability of tropical forests to climatic disturbances(4-9). The central African rainforests, the second-largest on Earth, have experienced a long-term drying trend(10,11) whose impacts on vegetation dynamics remain mostly unknown because in situ observations are very limited. The Congolese forest, with its drier conditions and higher percentage of semi-evergreen trees(12,13), may be more tolerant to short-term rainfall reduction than are wetter tropical forests(11), but for a long-term drought there may be critical thresholds of water availability below which higher-biomass, closed-canopy forests transition to more open, lower-biomass forests(1,2,14). Here we present observational evidence for a widespread decline in forest greenness over the past decade based on analyses of satellite data (optical, thermal, microwave and gravity) from several independent sensors over the Congo basin. This decline in vegetation greenness, particularly in the northern Congolese forest, is generally consistent with decreases in rainfall, terrestrial water storage, water content in aboveground woody and leaf biomass, and the canopy backscatter anomaly caused by changes in structure and moisture in upper forest layers. It is also consistent with increases in photosynthetically active radiation and land surface temperature. These multiple lines of evidence indicate that this large-scale vegetation browning, or loss of photosynthetic capacity, may be partially attributable to the long-term drying trend. Our results suggest that a continued gradual decline of photosynthetic capacity and moisture content driven by the persistent drying trend could alter the composition and structure of the Congolese forest to favour the spread of drought-tolerant species(1,2,14).","Zhou, Liming; Tian, Yuhong; Myneni, Ranga B.; Ciais, Philippe; Saatchi, Sassan; Liu, Yi Y.; Piao, Shilong; Chen, Haishan; Vermote, Eric F.; Song, Conghe; Hwang, Taehee","Zhou, LM; Tian, YH; Myneni, RB; Ciais, P; Saatchi, S; Liu, YY; Piao, SL; Chen, HS; Vermote, EF; Song, CH; Hwang, TH",86.0,"[Zhou, Liming] SUNY Albany, Dept Atmospher & Environm Sci, Albany, NY 12222 USA; [Tian, Yuhong] NOAA, IMSG, NESDIS, Ctr Satellite Applicat & Res,STAR, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Myneni, Ranga B.] Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Ciais, Philippe] UVSQ, CEA, CNRS, LSCE, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Saatchi, Sassan] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA; [Liu, Yi Y.] Univ New S Wales, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Syst Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Liu, Yi Y.] Univ New S Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Piao, Shilong] Peking Univ, Dept Ecol, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Chen, Haishan] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Minist Educ, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Vermote, Eric F.] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Song, Conghe] Univ N Carolina, Dept Geog, Chapel Hill, NC 29599 USA; [Song, Conghe] Anhui Agr Univ, Sch Forestry & Landscape Architecture, Hefei 230036, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Hwang, Taehee] Univ N Carolina, Inst Environm, Chapel Hill, NC 29599 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13265,Article,1476-4687,lzhou@albany.edu,+,"NOAA NESDIS [NA11NES4400010]; University at Albany, State University of New York; NASA's Earth Science Division; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41230422]","This study was supported by the NOAA NESDIS project (NA11NES4400010) and by the startup funds provided by the University at Albany, State University of New York.

16,110,279.0,"Transcription factors bind in a combinatorial fashion to specify the on-and-off states of genes; the ensemble of these binding events forms a regulatory network, constituting the wiring diagram for a cell. To examine the principles of the human transcriptional regulatory network, we determined the genomic binding information of 119 transcription-related factors in over 450 distinct experiments. We found the combinatorial, co-association of transcription factors to be highly context specific: distinct combinations of factors bind at specific genomic locations. In particular, there are significant differences in the binding proximal and distal to genes. We organized all the transcription factor binding into a hierarchy and integrated it with other genomic information (for example, microRNA regulation), forming a dense meta-network. Factors at different levels have different properties; for instance, top-level transcription factors more strongly influence expression and middle-level ones co-regulate targets to mitigate information-flow bottlenecks. Moreover, these co-regulations give rise to many enriched network motifs (for example, noise-buffering feed-forward loops). Finally, more connected network components are under stronger selection and exhibit a greater degree of allele-specific activity (that is, differential binding to the two parental alleles). The regulatory information obtained in this study will be crucial for interpreting personal genome sequences and understanding basic principles of human biology and disease.","Gerstein, Mark B.; Kundaje, Anshul; Hariharan, Manoj; Landt, Stephen G.; Yan, Koon-Kiu; Cheng, Chao; Mu, Xinmeng Jasmine; Khurana, Ekta; Rozowsky, Joel; Alexander, Roger; Min, Renqiang; Alves, Pedro; Abyzov, Alexej; Addleman, Nick; Bhardwaj, Nitin; Boyle, Alan P.; Cayting, Philip; Charos, Alexandra; Chen, David Z.; Cheng, Yong; Clarke, Declan; Eastman, Catharine; Euskirchen, Ghia; Frietze, Seth; Fu, Yao; Gertz, Jason; Grubert, Fabian; Harmanci, Arif; Jain, Preti; Kasowski, Maya; Lacroute, Phil; Leng, Jing; Lian, Jin; Monahan, Hannah; O'Geen, Henriette; Ouyang, Zhengqing; Partridge, E.

17,52,488.0,"The supply of some essential metals to pelagic ecosystems is less than the demand, so many phytoplankton have slow rates of photosynthetic production and restricted growth(1). The types and amounts of metals required by phytoplankton depends on their evolutionary history(2) and on their adaptations to metal availability(3,4), which varies widely among ocean habitats. Diatoms, for example, need considerably less iron ( Fe) to grow than chlorophyll-b-containing taxa(2), and the oceanic species demand roughly one-tenth the amount of coastal strains(5-7). Like Fe, copper (Cu) is scarce in the open sea, but notably higher concentrations of it are required for the growth of oceanic than of coastal isolates(8). Here we report that the greater Cu requirement in an oceanic diatom, Thalassiosira oceanica, is entirely due to a single Cu-containing protein, plastocyanin, which - until now - was only known to exist in organisms with chlorophyll b and cyanobacteria. Algae containing chlorophyll c, including the closely related coastal species T. weissflogii, are thought to lack plastocyanin and contain a functionally equivalent Fe-containing homologue, cytochrome c(6) (ref. 9). Copper deficiency in T. oceanica inhibits electron transport regardless of Fe status, implying a constitutive role for plastocyanin in the light reactions of photosynthesis in this species. The results suggest that selection pressure imposed by Fe limitation has resulted in the use of a Cu protein for photosynthesis in an oceanic diatom. This biochemical switch reduces the need for Fe and increases the requirement for Cu, which is relatively more abundant in the open sea.","Peers, G; Price, NM","Peers, G; Price, NM",341.0,"McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature04630,Article,,graham.peers@mail.mcgill.ca,344,,,043IB,,,CENTRIC DIATOMS; TRACE-METALS; MARINE-PHYTOPLANKTON; GENUS THALASSIOSIRA; IRON REQUIREMENT; COASTAL; CADMIUM; GROWTH; ZINC; LIMITATION,7091.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",18-May,4.0,LONDON,16572122.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,,"Peers, G (reprint author), McGill Univ, Dept Biol, 1205 Doctor Penfield Ave, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,144.0,Copper-containing plastocyanin used for electron transport by an oceanic diatom,6.0,58.0,WOS:000237593200046,488.0,441,Multidisciplinary Sciences,151,nm,price,317.0,3,male,1.0,4YcVh7UAAAAJ,1,"[0, 1474]",31122048,1,39418,1,List of AMD FX microprocessors,List of AMD FX microprocessors,0,0
18,103,416.0,"Progress in imaging and metrology depends on exquisite control over and comprehensive characterization of wave fields. As reflected in its name, coherent diffractive imaging relies on high coherence when reconstructing highly resolved images from diffraction intensities alone without the need for image-forming lenses(1-3). Fully coherent light can be described adequately by a single pure state. Yet partial coherence and imperfect detection often need to be accounted for, requiring statistical optics or the superposition of states(4,5). Furthermore, the dynamics of samples are increasingly the very objectives of experiments(6). Here we provide a general analytic approach to the characterization of diffractive imaging systems that can be described as low-rank mixed states. We use experimental data and simulations to show how the reconstruction technique compensates for and characterizes various sources of decoherence quantitatively. Based on ptychography(7,8), the procedure is closely related to quantum state tomography and is equally applicable to high-resolution microscopy, wave sensing and fluctuation measurements. As a result, some of the most stringent experimental conditions in ptychography can be relaxed, and susceptibility to imaging artefacts is reduced. Furthermore, the method yields high-resolution images of mixed states within the sample, which may include quantum mixtures or fast stationary stochastic processes such as vibrations, switching or steady flows.","Thibault, Pierre; Menzel, Andreas","Thibault, P; Menzel, A",68.0,"[Thibault, Pierre] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Phys, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Menzel, Andreas] Paul Scherrer Inst, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11806,Article,,pierre.thibault@tum.de,71,European Research Council [279753],"We thank M.

19,72,76.0,"Transmission spectroscopy has so far detected atomic and molecular absorption in Jupiter-sized exoplanets, but intense efforts to measure molecular absorption in the atmospheres of smaller (Neptune-sized) planets during transits have revealed only featureless spectra(1-4). From this it was concluded that the majority of small, warm planets evolve to sustain atmospheres with high mean molecular weights (little hydrogen), opaque clouds or scattering hazes, reducing our ability to observe the composition of these atmospheres(1-5). Here we report observations of the transmission spectrum of the exoplanet HAT-P-11b (which has a radius about four times that of Earth) from the optical wavelength range to the infrared. We detected water vapour absorption at a wavelength of 1.4 micrometres. The amplitude of the water absorption (approximately 250 parts per million) indicates that the planetary atmosphere is predominantly clear down to an altitude corresponding to about 1 millibar, and sufficiently rich in hydrogen to have a large scale height (over which the atmospheric pressure varies by a factor of e). The spectrum is indicative of a planetary atmosphere in which the abundance of heavy elements is no greater than about 700 times the solar value. This is in good agreement with the core-accretion theory of planet formation, in which a gas giant planet acquires its atmosphere by accreting hydrogen-rich gas directly from the protoplanetary nebula onto a large rocky or icy core(6).","Fraine, Jonathan; Deming, Drake; Benneke, Bjorn; Knutson, Heather; Jordan, Andres; Espinoza, Nestor; Madhusudhan, Nikku; Wilkins, Ashlee; Todorov, Kamen","Fraine, J; Deming, D; Benneke, B; Knutson, H; Jordan, A; Espinoza, N; Madhusudhan, N; Wilkins, A; Todorov, K",526.0,"[Fraine, Jonathan; Deming, Drake; Wilkins, Ashlee] Univ Maryland, Dept Astron, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Fraine, Jonathan; Jordan, Andres; Espinoza, Nestor] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Astrofis, Santiago 7820436, Chile; [Fraine, Jonathan; Benneke, Bjorn; Knutson, Heather] CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Deming, Drake] NASA, Astrobiol Inst Virtual Planetary Lab, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Madhusudhan, Nikku] Univ Cambridge, Inst Astron, Cambridge CB3 0HA, England; [Todorov, Kamen] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Phys, CH-8049 Zurich, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13785,Article,1476-4687,jfraine@astro.umd.edu,+,"'Millennium Institute of Astrophysics (MAS)' of the Millennium Science Initiative, Chilean Ministry of Economy [IC120009]; FONDECYT [1130857]; BASAL CATA [PFB-06]; CONICYT-PCHA/Doctorado Nacional","J.F., A.J. and N.E. acknowledge support from project IC120009 'Millennium Institute of Astrophysics (MAS)' of the Millennium Science Initiative, Chilean Ministry of Economy; FONDECYT project 1130857; and BASAL CATA PFB-06.

20,111,290.0,"Adult neurogenesis arises from neural stem cells within specialized niches(1-3). Neuronal activity and experience, presumably acting on this local niche, regulate multiple stages of adult neurogenesis, from neural progenitor proliferation to new neuron maturation, synaptic integration and survival(1,3). It is unknown whether local neuronal circuitry has a direct impact on adult neural stem cells. Here we show that, in the adult mouse hippocampus, nestin-expressing radial glia-like quiescent neural stem cells(4-9) (RGLs) respond tonically to the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) by means of gamma(2)-subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors. Clonal analysis(9) of individual RGLs revealed a rapid exit from quiescence and enhanced symmetrical self-renewal after conditional deletion of gamma(2). RGLs are in close proximity to terminals expressing 67-kDa glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD67) of parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons and respond tonically to GABA released from these neurons. Functionally, optogenetic control of the activity of dentate PV+ interneurons, but not that of somatostatin-expressing or vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons, can dictate the RGL choice between quiescence and activation. Furthermore, PV+ interneuron activation restores RGL quiescence after social isolation, an experience that induces RGL activation and symmetrical division(8). Our study identifies a niche cell-signal-receptor trio and a local circuitry mechanism that control the activation and self-renewal mode of quiescent adult neural stem cells in response to neuronal activity and experience.","Song, Juan; Zhong, Chun; Bonaguidi, Michael A.; Sun, Gerald J.; Hsu, Derek; Gu, Yan; Meletis, Konstantinos; Huang, Z.

21,119,34.0,"Opium is one of the world's oldest drugs, and its derivatives morphine and codeine are among the most used clinical drugs to relieve severe pain. These prototypical opioids produce analgesia as well as many undesirable side effects (sedation, apnoea and dependence) by binding to and activating the G-protein-coupled mu-opioid receptor (mu-OR) in the central nervous system. Here we describe the 2.8 angstrom crystal structure of the mouse mu-OR in complex with an irreversible morphinan antagonist. Compared to the buried binding pocket observed in most G-protein-coupled receptors published so far, the morphinan ligand binds deeply within a large solvent-exposed pocket. Of particular interest, the mu-OR crystallizes as a two-fold symmetrical dimer through a four-helix bundle motif formed by transmembrane segments 5 and 6. These high-resolution insights into opioid receptor structure will enable the application of structure-based approaches to develop better drugs for the management of pain and addiction.","Manglik, Aashish; Kruse, Andrew C.; Kobilka, Tong Sun; Thian, Foon Sun; Mathiesen, Jesper M.; Sunahara, Roger K.; Pardo, Leonardo; Weis, William I.; Kobilka, Brian K.; Granier, Sebastien","Manglik, A; Kruse, AC; Kobilka, TS; Thian, FS; Mathiesen, JM; Sunahara, RK; Pardo, L; Weis, WI; Kobilka, BK; Granier, S",321.0,"[Manglik, Aashish; Kruse, Andrew C.; Kobilka, Tong Sun; Thian, Foon Sun; Mathiesen, Jesper M.; Weis, William I.; Kobilka, Brian K.; Granier, Sebastien] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Physiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Sunahara, Roger K.] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Pardo, Leonardo] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Unit Bioestat, Lab Med Computac, Barcelona 08193, Spain; [Weis, William I.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Struct, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Granier, Sebastien] CNRS, INSERM, U661, UMR 5203, F-34094 Montpellier, France; [Granier, Sebastien] Univ Montpellier 1 & 2, Inst Genom Fonctionnelle, F-34094 Montpellier, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10954,Article,,kobilka@stanford.edu; granier@stanford.edu,U170,"INSERM; Stanford Medical Scientist Training Program; National Science Foundation; Lundbeck Foundation; National Institutes of Health [NS028471, DA031418]; Mathers Foundation","We acknowledge support from INSERM (S.

22,48,452.0,"Major ice sheets were permanently established on Antarctica approximately 34 million years ago(1-3), close to the Eocene/Oligocene boundary, at the same time as a permanent deepening of the calcite compensation depth in the world's oceans(4). Until recently, it was thought that Northern Hemisphere glaciation began much later, between 11 and 5 million years ago(1-3,5). This view has been challenged, however, by records of ice rafting at high northern latitudes during the Eocene epoch(6,7) and by estimates of global ice volume that exceed the storage capacity of Antarctica(8) at the same time as a temporary deepening of the calcite compensation depth 41.6 million years ago(9). Here we test the hypothesis that large ice sheets were present in both hemispheres 41.6 million years ago using marine sediment records of oxygen and carbon isotope values and of calcium carbonate content from the equatorial Atlantic Ocean. These records allow, at most, an ice budget that can easily be accommodated on Antarctica, indicating that large ice sheets were not present in the Northern Hemisphere. The records also reveal a brief interval shortly before the temporary deepening of the calcite compensation depth during which the calcite compensation depth shoaled, ocean temperatures increased and carbon isotope values decreased in the equatorial Atlantic. The nature of these changes around 41.6 million years ago implies common links, in terms of carbon cycling, with events at the Eocene/Oligocene boundary(4) and with the 'hyperthermals' of the Early Eocene climate optimum(3,10,11). Our findings help to resolve the apparent discrepancy between the geological records of Northern Hemisphere glaciation(6-8) and model results(12,13) that indicate that the threshold for continental glaciation was crossed earlier in the Southern Hemisphere than in the Northern Hemisphere.","Edgar, Kirsty M.; Wilson, Paul A.; Sexton, Philip F.; Suganuma, Yusuke","Edgar, KM; Wilson, PA; Sexton, PF; Suganuma, Y",908.0,"Natl Oceanog Ctr, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England; Univ Tokyo, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06053,Article,,paw1@noc.soton.ac.uk,911,,,202OM,,,ATMOSPHERIC CARBON-DIOXIDE; ICE-SHEET EXPANSION; ANTARCTIC GLACIATION; OLIGOCENE; OCEAN; PALEOCENE; GREENLAND; MAXIMUM; RECORDS,7156.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,"suganuma, yusuke/0000-0003-3516-1317; Edgar, Kirsty/0000-0001-7587-9951","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",23-Aug,4.0,LONDON,17713530.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007.0,"Sexton, Philip/B-2493-2010","Wilson, PA (reprint author), Natl Oceanog Ctr, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci, European Way, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,51.0,No extreme bipolar glaciation during the main Eocene calcite compensation shift,0.0,18.0,WOS:000248912900042,452.0,448,Multidisciplinary Sciences,52,yusuke,suganuma,563.0,28,male,1.0,Jaf7rrYAAAAJ,1,"[0, 1474]",53708210,1,14608977,1,2014 in Antarctica,2014 in Antarctica,0,0
23,45,182.0,"The microtubule cytoskeleton is essential to cell morphogenesis. Growing microtubule plus ends have emerged as dynamic regulatory sites in which specialized proteins, called plus- end- binding proteins ( + TIPs), bind and regulate the proper functioning of microtubules(1-4). However, the molecular mechanism of plus- end association by + TIPs and their ability to track the growing end are not well understood. Here we report the in vitro reconstitution of a minimal plus- end tracking system consisting of the three fission yeast proteins Mal3, Tip1 and the kinesin Tea2. Using time- lapse total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we show that the EB1 homologue Mal3 has an enhanced affinity for growing microtubule end structures as opposed to the microtubule lattice. This allows it to track growing microtubule ends autonomously by an end recognition mechanism. In addition, Mal3 acts as a factor that mediates loading of the processive motor Tea2 and its cargo, the Clip170 homologue Tip1, onto the microtubule lattice. The interaction of all three proteins is required for the selective tracking of growing microtubule plus ends by both Tea2 and Tip1. Our results dissect the collective interactions of the constituents of this plus-end tracking system and show how these interactions lead to the emergence of its dynamic behaviour. We expect that such in vitro reconstitutions will also be essential for the mechanistic dissection of other plus- end tracking systems.","Bieling, Peter; Laan, Liedewij; Schek, Henry; Munteanu, E.

24,22,199.0,"The largest extant snakes live in the tropics of South America and southeast Asia(1-3) where high temperatures facilitate the evolution of large body sizes among air- breathing animals whose body temperatures are dependant on ambient environmental temperatures ( poikilothermy)(4,5). Very little is known about ancient tropical terrestrial ecosystems, limiting our understanding of the evolution of giant snakes and their relationship to climate in the past. Here we describe a boid snake from the oldest known neotropical rainforest fauna from the Cerrejon Formation ( 58 - 60 Myr ago) in northeastern Colombia. We estimate a body length of 13 and a mass of 1,135 kg, making it the largest known snake(6-9). The maximum size of poikilothermic animals at a given temperature is limited by metabolic rate(4), and a snake of this size would require a minimum mean annual temperature of 30 - 34 degrees C to survive. This estimate is consistent with hypotheses of hot Palaeocene neotropics with high concentrations of atmospheric CO(2) based on climate models(10). Comparison of palaeotemperature estimates from the equator to those from South American mid- latitudes indicates a relatively steep temperature gradient during the early Palaeogene greenhouse, similar to that of today. Depositional environments and faunal composition of the Cerrejon Formation indicate an anaconda- like ecology for the giant snake, and an earliest Cenozoic origin of neotropical vertebrate faunas.","Head, Jason J.; Bloch, Jonathan I.; Hastings, Alexander K.; Bourque, Jason R.; Cadena, Edwin A.; Herrera, Fabiany A.; Polly, P.

25,7,100.0,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) mediate post-transcriptional gene regulation through association with Argonaute proteins (AGOs)(1). Crystal structures of archaeal and bacterial homologues of AGOs have shown that the MID(middle) domain mediates the interaction with the phosphorylated 5' end of the miRNA guide strand and this interaction is thought to be independent of the identity of the 5' nucleotide in these systems(2,3). However, analysis of the known sequences of eukaryotic miRNAs and co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that there is a clear bias for U or A at the 5' position(4-7). Here we report the crystal structure of a MID domain from a eukaryotic AGO protein, human AGO2. The structure, in complex with nucleoside monophosphates (AMP, CMP, GMP, and UMP) mimicking the 5' end of miRNAs, shows that there are specific contacts made between the base of UMP or AMP and a rigid loop in the MID domain. Notably, the structure of the loop discriminates against CMP and GMP and dissociation constants calculated from NMR titration experiments confirm these results, showing that AMP (0.26 mM) and UMP (0.12 mM) bind with up to 30-fold higher affinity than either CMP (3.6 mM) or GMP (3.3 mM). This study provides structural evidence for nucleotide-specific interactions in the MID domain of eukaryotic AGO proteins and explains the observed preference for U or A at the 5' end of miRNAs.","Frank, Filipp; Sonenberg, Nahum; Nagar, Bhushan","Frank, F; Sonenberg, N; Nagar, B",818.0,"[Frank, Filipp; Sonenberg, Nahum; Nagar, Bhushan] McGill Univ, Dept Biochem, Montreal, PQ H3G 0B1, Canada; [Frank, Filipp; Sonenberg, Nahum] McGill Univ, Goodman Canc Ctr, Montreal, PQ H3G 0B1, Canada; [Frank, Filipp; Nagar, Bhushan] Grp Rech Axe Struct Prot, Montreal, PQ H3G 0B1, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09039,Article,,bhushan.nagar@mcgill.ca,822,Canada Research Chair; Human Frontiers Science Program [CDA 0018/2006-C/1]; Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) [MOP-82929]; Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds,"We thank O.

Genomic alterations in squamous cell lung cancers have not been comprehensively characterized, and no molecularly targeted agents have been specifically developed for its treatment. As part of The Cancer Genome Atlas, here we profile 178 lung squamous cell carcinomas to provide a comprehensive landscape of genomic and epigenomic alterations. We show that the tumour type is characterized by complex genomic alterations, with a mean of 360 exonic mutations, 165 genomic rearrangements, and 323 segments of copy number alteration per tumour. We find statistically recurrent mutations in 11 genes, including mutation of TP53 in nearly all specimens. Previously unreported loss-of-function mutations are seen in the HLA-A class I major histocompatibility gene. Significantly altered pathways included NFE2L2 and KEAP1 in 34%, squamous differentiation genes in 44%, phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase pathway genes in 47%, and CDKN2A and RB1 in 72% of tumours. We identified a potential therapeutic target in most tumours, offering new avenues of investigation for the treatment of squamous cell lung cancers.","Hammerman, Peter S.; Lawrence, Michael S.; Voet, Douglas; Jing, Rui; Cibulskis, Kristian; Sivachenko, Andrey; Stojanov, Petar; McKenna, Aaron; Lander, Eric S.; Gabriel, Stacey; Getz, Gad; Sougnez, Carrie; Imielinski, Marcin; Helman, Elena; Hernandez, Bryan; Pho, Nam H.; Meyerson, Matthew; Chu, Andy; Chun, Hye-Jung E.; Mungall, Andrew J.; Pleasance, Erin; Robertson, A.

27,91,284.0,"The effect of anthropogenic aerosols on cloud droplet concentrations and radiative properties is the source of one of the largest uncertainties in the radiative forcing of climate over the industrial period. This uncertainty affects our ability to estimate how sensitive the climate is to greenhouse gas emissions. Here we perform a sensitivity analysis on a global model to quantify the uncertainty in cloud radiative forcing over the industrial period caused by uncertainties in aerosol emissions and processes. Our results show that 45 per cent of the variance of aerosol forcing since about 1750 arises from uncertainties in natural emissions of volcanic sulphur dioxide, marine dimethylsulphide, biogenic volatile organic carbon, biomass burning and sea spray. Only 34 per cent of the variance is associated with anthropogenic emissions. The results point to the importance of understanding pristine pre-industrial-like environments, with natural aerosols only, and suggest that improved measurements and evaluation of simulated aerosols in polluted present-day conditions will not necessarily result in commensurate reductions in the uncertainty of forcing estimates.","Carslaw, K.

28,15,329.0,"Although bisexual reproduction has proven to be highly successful, parthenogenetic all-female populations occur frequently in certain taxa, including the whiptail lizards of the genus Aspidoscelis. Allozyme analysis revealed a high degree of fixed heterozygosity in these parthenogenetic species(1,2), supporting the view that they originated from hybridization events between related sexual species. It has remained unclear how the meiotic program is altered to produce diploid eggs while maintaining heterozygosity. Here we show that meiosis commences with twice the number of chromosomes in parthenogenetic versus sexual species, a mechanism that provides the basis for generating gametes with unreduced chromosome content without fundamental deviation from the classic meiotic program. Our observation of synaptonemal complexes and chiasmata demonstrate that a typical meiotic program occurs and that heterozygosity is not maintained by bypassing recombination. Instead, fluorescent in situ hybridization probes that distinguish between homologues reveal that bivalents form between sister chromosomes, the genetically identical products of the first of two premeiotic replication cycles. Sister chromosome pairing provides a mechanism for the maintenance of heterozygosity, which is critical for offsetting the reduced fitness associated with the lack of genetic diversity in parthenogenetic species.","Lutes, Aracely A.; Neaves, William B.; Baumann, Diana P.; Wiegraebe, Winfried; Baumann, Peter","Lutes, AA; Neaves, WB; Baumann, DP; Wiegraebe, W; Baumann, P",283.0,"[Lutes, Aracely A.; Neaves, William B.; Baumann, Diana P.; Wiegraebe, Winfried; Baumann, Peter] Stowers Inst Med Res, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; [Lutes, Aracely A.; Baumann, Peter] Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Dept Mol & Integrat Physiol, Kansas City, KS 66160 USA; [Neaves, William B.] Univ Missouri, Sch Med, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; [Baumann, Peter] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08818,Article,,peb@stowers.org,U164,Stowers Institute for Medical Research; Pew Charitable Trusts,"We thank the staff of the Reptile Facility for their dedication to animal husbandry; C.

29,130,144.0,"Follicular lymphoma (FL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) are the two most common non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs). Here we sequenced tumour and matched normal DNA from 13 DLBCL cases and one FL case to identify genes with mutations in B-cell NHL. We analysed RNA-seq data from these and another 113 NHLs to identify genes with candidate mutations, and then re-sequenced tumour and matched normal DNA from these cases to confirm 109 genes with multiple somatic mutations. Genes with roles in histone modification were frequent targets of somatic mutation. For example, 32% of DLBCL and 89% of FL cases had somatic mutations in MLL2, which encodes a histone methyltransferase, and 11.4% and 13.4% of DLBCL and FL cases, respectively, had mutations in MEF2B, a calcium-regulated gene that cooperates with CREBBP and EP300 in acetylating histones. Our analysis suggests a previously unappreciated disruption of chromatin biology in lymphomagenesis.","Morin, Ryan D.; Mendez-Lago, Maria; Mungall, Andrew J.; Goya, Rodrigo; Mungall, Karen L.; Corbett, Richard D.; Johnson, Nathalie A.; Severson, Tesa M.; Chiu, Readman; Field, Matthew; Jackman, Shaun; Krzywinski, Martin; Scott, David W.; Trinh, Diane L.; Tamura-Wells, Jessica; Li, Sa; Firme, Marlo R.; Rogic, Sanja; Griffith, Malachi; Chan, Susanna; Yakovenko, Oleksandr; Meyer, Irmtraud M.; Zhao, Eric Y.; Smailus, Duane; Moksa, Michelle; Chittaranjan, Suganthi; Rimsza, Lisa; Brooks-Wilson, Angela; Spinelli, John J.; Ben-Neriah, Susana; Meissner, Barbara; Woolcock, Bruce; Boyle, Merrill; McDonald, Helen; Tam, Angela; Zhao, Yongjun; Delaney, Allen; Zeng, Thomas; Tse, Kane; Butterfield, Yaron; Birol, Inanc; Holt, Rob; Schein, Jacqueline; Horsman, Douglas E.; Moore, Richard; Jones, Steven J.

30,18,77.0,"Geological mapping and geochronological studies have shown much lower eruption rates for ocean island basalts (OIBs) in comparison with those of lavas from large igneous provinces (LIPs) such as oceanic plateaux and continental flood provinces(1). However, a quantitative petrological comparison has never been made between mantle source temperature and the extent of melting for OIB and LIP sources. Here we show that the MgO and FeO contents of Galapagos related lavas and their primary magmas have decreased since the Cretaceous period. From petrological modelling(2), we infer that these changes reflect a cooling of the Galapagos mantle plume from a potential temperature of 1,560-1,620 degrees C in the Cretaceous to 1,500 degrees C at present. Iceland also exhibits secular cooling, in agreement with previous studies(3,4). Our work provides quantitative petrological evidence that, in general, mantle plumes for LIPs with Palaeocene-Permian ages were hotter and melted more extensively than plumes of more modern ocean islands. We interpret this to reflect episodic flow from lower-mantle domains that are lithologically and geochemically heterogeneous.","Herzberg, Claude; Gazel, Esteban","Herzberg, C; Gazel, E",619.0,"[Herzberg, Claude; Gazel, Esteban] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07857,Article,,herzberg@rci.rutgers.edu,U83,,,427RK,,,ATLANTIC IGNEOUS PROVINCE; FLOOD BASALTS; TECTONIC EVOLUTION; THERMAL STRUCTURE; OCEANIC PLATEAUS; MELT GENERATION; LITHOSPHERE; CONSTRAINTS; GREENLAND; VOLCANISM,7238.0,NATURE,Nature,English,35.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2-Apr,5.0,LONDON,19340079.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2009.0,"Gazel, Esteban/B-8090-2012","Herzberg, C (reprint author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, 610 Taylor Rd, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,106.0,Petrological evidence for secular cooling in mantle plumes,3.0,46.0,WOS:000264796200038,77.0,458,Multidisciplinary Sciences,106,esteban,gazel,807.0,495,male,1.0,RwEXWNoAAAAJ,1,"[0, 1474]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
31,119,154.0,"Human language, as well as birdsong, relies on the ability to arrange vocal elements in new sequences. However, little is known about the ontogenetic origin of this capacity. Here we track the development of vocal combinatorial capacity in three species of vocal learners, combining an experimental approach in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) with an analysis of natural development of vocal transitions in Bengalese finches (Lonchura striata domestica) and pre-lingual human infants. We find a common, stepwise pattern of acquiring vocal transitions across species. In our first study, juvenile zebra finches were trained to perform one song and then the training target was altered, prompting the birds to swap syllable order, or insert a new syllable into a string. All birds solved these permutation tasks in a series of steps, gradually approximating the target sequence by acquiring new pairwise syllable transitions, sometimes too slowly to accomplish the task fully. Similarly, in the more complex songs of Bengalese finches, branching points and bidirectional transitions in song syntax were acquired in a stepwise fashion, starting from a more restrictive set of vocal transitions. The babbling of pre-lingual human infants showed a similar pattern: instead of a single developmental shift from reduplicated to variegated babbling (that is, from repetitive to diverse sequences), we observed multiple shifts, where each new syllable type slowly acquired a diversity of pairwise transitions, asynchronously over development. Collectively, these results point to a common generative process that is conserved across species, suggesting that the long-noted gap between perceptual versus motor combinatorial capabilities in human infants(1) may arise partly from the challenges in constructing new pairwise vocal transitions.","Lipkind, Dina; Marcus, Gary F.; Bemis, Douglas K.; Sasahara, Kazutoshi; Jacoby, Nori; Takahasi, Miki; Suzuki, Kenta; Feher, Olga; Ravbar, Primoz; Okanoya, Kazuo; Tchernichovski, Ofer","Lipkind, D; Marcus, GF; Bemis, DK; Sasahara, K; Jacoby, N; Takahasi, M; Suzuki, K; Feher, O; Ravbar, P; Okanoya, K; Tchernichovski, O",104.0,"[Lipkind, Dina; Feher, Olga; Tchernichovski, Ofer] CUNY Hunter Coll, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Lipkind, Dina; Feher, Olga; Ravbar, Primoz; Tchernichovski, Ofer] CUNY City Coll, Dept Biol, New York, NY 10031 USA; [Marcus, Gary F.; Bemis, Douglas K.] NYU, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Sasahara, Kazutoshi; Takahasi, Miki; Suzuki, Kenta; Okanoya, Kazuo] RIKEN Brain Sci Inst, Lab Biolinguist, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Jacoby, Nori] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Interdisciplinary Ctr Neural Computat, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel; [Jacoby, Nori] Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Mus, IL-5290002 Ramat Gan, Israel; [Suzuki, Kenta; Okanoya, Kazuo] JST ERATO Okanoya Emot Informat Project, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Feher, Olga; Ravbar, Primoz; Tchernichovski, Ofer] CUNY, Grad Ctr, New York, NY 10016 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12173,Article,,dina.lipkind@gmail.com,+,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan; US Public Health Service grant","We thank J.

32,83,78.0,"Bedrock erosion in rivers sets the pace of landscape evolution, influences the evolution of orogens and determines the size, shape and relief of mountains(1,2). A variety of models link fluid flow and sediment transport processes to bedrock incision in canyons. The model components that represent sediment transport processes are increasingly well developed(3-5). In contrast, the model components being used to represent fluid flow are largely untested because there are no observations of the flow structure in bedrock canyons. Here we present a 524-kilometre, continuous centreline, acoustic Doppler current profiler survey of the Fraser Canyon in western Canada, which includes 42 individual bedrock canyons. Our observations of three-dimensional flow structure reveal that, as water enters the canyons, a high-velocity core follows the bed surface, causing a velocity inversion (high velocities near the bed and low velocities at the surface). The plunging water then upwells along the canyon walls, resulting in counter-rotating, along-stream coherent flow structures that diverge near the bed. The resulting flow structure promotes deep scour in the bedrock channel floor and undercutting of the canyon walls. This provides a mechanism for channel widening and ensures that the base of the walls is swept clear of the debris that is often deposited there, keeping the walls nearly vertical. These observations reveal that the flow structure in bedrock canyons is more complex than assumed in the models presently used. Fluid flow models that capture the essence of the three-dimensional flow field, using simple phenomenological rules that are computationally tractable, are required to capture the dynamic coupling between flow, bedrock erosion and solid-Earth dynamics.","Venditti, Jeremy G.; Rennie, Colin D.; Bomhof, James; Bradley, Ryan W.; Little, Malcolm; Church, Michael","Venditti, JG; Rennie, CD; Bomhof, J; Bradley, RW; Little, M; Church, M",534.0,"[Venditti, Jeremy G.; Bradley, Ryan W.; Little, Malcolm] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Geog, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Rennie, Colin D.; Bomhof, James] Univ Ottawa, Dept Civil Engn, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Church, Michael] Univ British Columbia, Dept Geog, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13779,Article,1476-4687,jeremy_venditti@sfu.ca,+,Natural Science and Engineering Research Council,"This study was supported by Natural Science and Engineering Research Council grants to M.

33,5,238.0,"Sex determination is a fundamental biological process, yet its mechanisms are remarkably diverse(1,2). In vertebrates, sex can be determined by inherited genetic factors or by the temperature experienced during embryonic development(2,3). However, the evolutionary causes of this diversity remain unknown. Here we show that live-bearing lizards at different climatic extremes of the species' distribution differ in their sex-determining mechanisms, with temperature-dependent sex determination in lowlands and genotypic sex determination in highlands. A theoretical model parameterized with field data accurately predicts this divergence in sex-determining systems and the consequence thereof for variation in cohort sex ratios among years. Furthermore, we show that divergent natural selection on sex determination across altitudes is caused by climatic effects on lizard life history and variation in the magnitude of between-year temperature fluctuations. Our results establish an adaptive explanation for intra-specific divergence in sex-determining systems driven by phenotypic plasticity and ecological selection, thereby providing a unifying framework for integrating the developmental, ecological and evolutionary basis for variation in vertebrate sex determination.","Pen, Ido; Uller, Tobias; Feldmeyer, Barbara; Harts, Anna; While, Geoffrey M.; Wapstra, Erik","Pen, I; Uller, T; Feldmeyer, B; Harts, A; While, GM; Wapstra, E",436.0,"[Pen, Ido; Feldmeyer, Barbara; Harts, Anna] Univ Groningen, Theoret Biol Grp, NL-9750 AA Haren, Netherlands; [Uller, Tobias] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Edward Grey Inst, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [While, Geoffrey M.; Wapstra, Erik] Univ Tasmania, Sch Zool, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09512,Article,,i.r.pen@rug.nl,U262,Australian Research Council [DP0877948]; Hermon Slade Foundation; Wenner-Gren Foundations,"Funding was provided by the Australian Research Council to E.W., T.U. and I.P.

34,65,103.0,"The mechanical properties of many materials are based on the macroscopic arrangement and orientation of their nanostructure. This nanostructure can be ordered over a range of length scales. In biology, the principle of hierarchical ordering is often used to maximize functionality, such as strength and robustness of the material, while minimizing weight and energy cost. Methods for nanoscale imaging provide direct visual access to the ultrastructure (nanoscale structure that is too small to be imaged using light microscopy), but the field of view is limited and does not easily allow a full correlative study of changes in the ultrastructure over a macroscopic sample. Other methods of probing ultrastructure ordering, such as small-angle scattering of X-rays or neutrons, can be applied to macroscopic samples; however, these scattering methods remain constrained to two-dimensional specimens(1-4) or to isotropically oriented ultrastructures(5-7). These constraints limit the use of these methods for studying nanostructures with more complex orientation patterns, which are abundant in nature and materials science. Here, we introduce an imaging method that combines small-angle scattering with tensor tomography to probe nanoscale structures in three-dimensional macroscopic samples in a non-destructive way. We demonstrate the method by measuring the main orientation and the degree of orientation of nanoscale mineralized collagen fibrils in a human trabecula bone sample with a spatial resolution of 25 micrometres. Symmetries within the sample, such as the cylindrical symmetry commonly observed for mineralized collagen fibrils in bone(8-10), allow for tractable sampling requirements and numerical efficiency. Small-angle scattering tensor tomography is applicable to both biological and materials science specimens, and may be useful for understanding and characterizing smart or bio-inspired materials. Moreover, because the method is non-destructive, it is appropriate for in situ measurements and allows, for example, the role of ultrastructure in the mechanical response of a biological tissue or manufactured material to be studied.","Liebi, Marianne; Georgiadis, Marios; Menzel, Andreas; Schneider, Philipp; Kohlbrecher, Joachim; Bunk, Oliver; Guizar-Sicairos, Manuel","Liebi, M; Georgiadis, M; Menzel, A; Schneider, P; Kohlbrecher, J; Bunk, O; Guizar-Sicairos, M",349.0,"[Liebi, Marianne; Menzel, Andreas; Kohlbrecher, Joachim; Bunk, Oliver; Guizar-Sicairos, Manuel] Paul Scherrer Inst, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland; [Georgiadis, Marios] ETH, Inst Biomech, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Schneider, Philipp] Univ Southampton, Bioengn Sci Res Grp, Fac Engn & Environm, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature16056,Article,1476-4687,marianne.liebi@psi.ch; manuel.guizar-sicairos@psi.ch,+,ETH Research Grant [ETH-39 11-1],"We thank M.

35,86,146.0,"Bone-resorbing osteoclasts significantly contribute to osteoporosis and bone metastases of cancer(1-3). MicroRNAs play important roles in physiology and disease(4,5), and present tremendous therapeutic potential(6). Nonetheless, how microRNAs regulate skeletal biology is underexplored. Here we identify miR-34a as a novel and critical suppressor of osteoclastogenesis, bone resorption and the bone metastatic niche. miR-34a is downregulated during osteoclast differentiation. Osteoclastic miR-34a-overexpressing transgenic mice exhibit lower bone resorption and higher bone mass. Conversely, miR-34a knockout and heterozygous mice exhibit elevated bone resorption and reduced bone mass. Consequently, ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis, as well as bone metastasis of breast and skin cancers, are diminished in osteoclastic miR-34a transgenic mice, and can be effectively attenuated by miR-34a nanoparticle treatment. Mechanistically, we identify transforming growth factor-beta-induced factor 2 (Tgif2) as an essential direct miR-34a target that is pro-osteoclastogenic. Tgif2 deletion reduces bone resorption and abolishes miR-34a regulation. Together, using mouse genetic, pharmacological and disease models, we reveal miR-34a as a key osteoclast suppressor and a potential therapeutic strategy to confer skeletal protection and ameliorate bone metastasis of cancers.","Krzeszinski, Jing Y.; Wei, Wei; HoangDinh Huynh; Jin, Zixue; Wang, Xunde; Chang, Tsung-Cheng; Xie, Xian-Jin; He, Lin; Mangala, Lingegowda S.; Lopez-Berestein, Gabriel; Sood, Anil K.; Mendell, Joshua T.; Wan, Yihong","Krzeszinski, JY; Wei, W; Huynh, H; Jin, ZX; Wang, XD; Chang, TC; Xie, XJ; He, L; Mangala, LS; Lopez-Berestein, G; Sood, AK; Mendell, JT; Wan, YH",431.0,"[Krzeszinski, Jing Y.; Wei, Wei; HoangDinh Huynh; Jin, Zixue; Wang, Xunde; Wan, Yihong] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Pharmacol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Chang, Tsung-Cheng; Mendell, Joshua T.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Mol Biol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Xie, Xian-Jin; Mendell, Joshua T.; Wan, Yihong] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Simmons Canc Ctr, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Xie, Xian-Jin] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Clin Sci, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [He, Lin] Univ Calif Berkeley, Mol & Cell Biol Dept, Div Cellular & Dev Biol, Berkeley, CA 94705 USA; [Mangala, Lingegowda S.; Sood, Anil K.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Gynecol Oncol & Reprod Med, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Mangala, Lingegowda S.; Lopez-Berestein, Gabriel; Sood, Anil K.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Ctr RNA Interference & Noncoding RNA, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Lopez-Berestein, Gabriel] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Expt Therapeut, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Sood, Anil K.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Canc Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13375,Article,1476-4687,yihong.wan@utsouthwestern.edu,U460,"CPRIT [RP130145, R1008]; DOD [BC122877]; National Institutes of Health [R01 DK089113, R01 CA120185, P01 CA134292, U54 CA151668, UH2 TR000943, R01 CA139067]; Welch Foundation [I-1751]; University of Texas Southwestern Endowed Scholar Startup Fund; Harold C.

The structure of the proteolysed receptor, made up of two fragments and comprising part of the intracellular domain, was determined in complex with stabilizing nanobodies. The extracellular domain reveals the detailed anatomy of the neurotransmitter binding site capped by a nanobody. The membrane domain delimits an aqueous pore with a 4.6 angstrom constriction. In the intracellular domain, a bundle of five intracellular helices creates a closed vestibule where lateral portals are obstructed by loops. This 5-HT3 receptor structure, revealing part of the intracellular domain, expands the structural basis for understanding the operating mechanism of mammalian Cys-loop receptors.","Hassaine, Gherici; Deluz, Cedric; Grasso, Luigino; Wyss, Romain; Tol, Menno B.; Hovius, Ruud; Graff, Alexandra; Stahlberg, Henning; Tomizaki, Takashi; Desmyter, Aline; Moreau, Christophe; Li, Xiao-Dan; Poitevin, Frederic; Vogel, Horst; Nury, Hugues","Hassaine, G; Deluz, C; Grasso, L; Wyss, R; Tol, MB; Hovius, R; Graff, A; Stahlberg, H; Tomizaki, T; Desmyter, A; Moreau, C; Li, XD; Poitevin, F; Vogel, H; Nury, H",276.0,"[Hassaine, Gherici; Deluz, Cedric; Grasso, Luigino; Wyss, Romain; Tol, Menno B.; Hovius, Ruud; Vogel, Horst; Nury, Hugues] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lab Phys Chem Polymers & Membranes, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Graff, Alexandra; Stahlberg, Henning] Univ Basel, Biozentrum, Ctr Cellular Imaging & NanoAnalyt, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland; [Tomizaki, Takashi] Paul Scherrer Inst, Swiss Light Source, CH-5234 Villigen, Switzerland; [Desmyter, Aline] CNRS, UMR 7257, F-13288 Marseille, France; [Desmyter, Aline] Univ Aix Marseille, F-13288 Marseille, France; [Moreau, Christophe; Nury, Hugues] Univ Grenoble Alpes, IBS, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Moreau, Christophe; Nury, Hugues] CNRS, IBS, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Moreau, Christophe; Nury, Hugues] CEA, DSV, IBS, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Li, Xiao-Dan] Paul Scherrer Inst, Lab Biomol Res, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland; [Poitevin, Frederic] Inst Pasteur, CNRS, UMR3528, Unite Dynam Struct Macromol, F-75015 Paris, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13552,Article,1476-4687,horst.vogel@epfl.ch; hugues.nury@ibs.fr,+,Swiss National Science Foundation [31003A-133141]; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; European Community [211800]; Human Frontier Science Program; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (VenomPicoScreen project) [ANR-11-RPIB-022-04],"Research in the laboratory of H.

37,82,70.0,"To repair double-strand DNA breaks by homologous recombination, the 5'-terminated DNA strand must first be resected, which generates 3' single-stranded DNA overhangs. Genetic evidence suggests that this process is initiated by the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 (MRX) complex(1-3). However, its involvement was puzzling, as the complex possesses exonuclease activity with the opposite (3' to 5') polarity from that required for homologous recombination(4,5). Consequently, a bidirectional model has been proposed(6-8) whereby dsDNA is first incised endonucleolytically and MRX then proceeds back to the dsDNA end using its 3' to 5' exonuclease. The endonuclease creates entry sites for Sgs1-Dna2 and/or Exo1, which then carry out long-range resection in the 5' to 3' direction. However, the identity of the endonuclease remained unclear. Using purified Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins, we show that Sae2 promotes dsDNA-specific endonuclease activity by the Mre11 subunit within the MRX complex. The endonuclease preferentially cleaves the 5'-terminated dsDNA strand, which explains the polarity paradox. The dsDNA end clipping is strongly stimulated by protein blocks at the DNA end, and requires the ATPase activity ofRad50 and physical interactions between MRX and Sae2. Our results suggest that MRX initiates dsDNA break processing by dsDNA endonuclease rather than exonuclease activity, and that Sae2 is the key regulator of this process.

38,19,12.0,"Iron, cobalt and nickel are archetypal ferromagnetic metals. In bulk, electronic conduction in these materials takes place mainly through the s and p electrons, whereas the magnetic moments are mostly in the narrow d-electron bands, where they tend to align. This general picture may change at the nanoscale because electrons at the surfaces of materials experience interactions that differ from those in the bulk. Here we show direct evidence for such changes: electronic transport in atomic-scale contacts of pure ferromagnets ( iron, cobalt and nickel), despite their strong bulk ferromagnetism, unexpectedly reveal Kondo physics, that is, the screening of local magnetic moments by the conduction electrons below a characteristic temperature(1). The Kondo effect creates a sharp resonance at the Fermi energy, affecting the electrical properties of the system; this appears as a Fano-Kondo resonance(2) in the conductance characteristics as observed in other artificial nanostructures(3-11). The study of hundreds of contacts shows material-dependent log-normal distributions of the resonance width that arise naturally from Kondo theory(12). These resonances broaden and disappear with increasing temperature, also as in standard Kondo systems(4-7). Our observations, supported by calculations, imply that coordination changes can significantly modify magnetism at the nanoscale. Therefore, in addition to standard micromagnetic physics, strong electronic correlations along with atomic-scale geometry need to be considered when investigating the magnetic properties of magnetic nanostructures.","Reyes Calvo, M.; Fernandez-Rossier, Joaquin; Jose Palacios, Juan; Jacob, David; Natelson, Douglas; Untiedt, Carlos","Calvo, MR; Fernandez-Rossier, J; Palacios, JJ; Jacob, D; Natelson, D; Untiedt, C",1150.0,"[Reyes Calvo, M.; Fernandez-Rossier, Joaquin; Jose Palacios, Juan; Untiedt, Carlos] Univ Alicante, Fac Ciencias, Dept Fis Aplicada, E-03790 Alicante, Spain; [Jacob, David] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; [Natelson, Douglas] Rice Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Houston, TX 77005 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07878,Article,1476-4687,untiedt@ua.es,U85,"European Union through MolSpinQIP and Spanish MEC [MAT2007-65487, 31099-E, CSD2007-0010]; US National Science Foundation (NSF) [DMR-0528969]; NSF [DMR-0347253]; Lucille Packard Foundation; W.

39,124,467.0,"Cubic boron nitride (cBN) is a well known superhard material that has a wide range of industrial applications. Nanostructuring of cBN is an effective way to improve its hardness by virtue of the Hall-Petch effect-the tendency for hardness to increase with decreasing grain size(1,2). Polycrystalline cBN materials are often synthesized by using the martensitic transformation of a graphite-like BN precursor, in which high pressures and temperatures lead to puckering of the BN layers(3). Such approaches have led to synthetic polycrystalline cBN having grain sizes as small as similar to 14 nm (refs 1, 2, 4, 5). Here we report the formation of cBN with a nanostructure dominated by fine twin domains of average thickness similar to 3.8 nm. This nanotwinned cBN was synthesized from specially prepared BN precursor nanoparticles possessing onion-like nested structures with intrinsically puckered BN layers and numerous stacking faults. The resulting nanotwinned cBN bulk samples are optically transparent with a striking combination of physical properties: an extremely high Vickers hardness (exceeding 100 GPa, the optimal hardness of synthetic diamond), a high oxidization temperature (similar to 1,294 degrees C) and a large fracture toughness (>12 MPa m(1/2), well beyond the toughness of commercial cemented tungsten carbide, similar to 10 MPa m(1/2)). We show that hardening of cBN is continuous with decreasing twin thickness down to the smallest sizes investigated, contrasting with the expected reverse Hall-Petch effect below a critical grain size or the twin thickness of similar to 10-15 nm found in metals and alloys.","Tian, Yongjun; Xu, Bo; Yu, Dongli; Ma, Yanming; Wang, Yanbin; Jiang, Yingbing; Hu, Wentao; Tang, Chengchun; Gao, Yufei; Luo, Kun; Zhao, Zhisheng; Wang, Li-Min; Wen, Bin; He, Julong; Liu, Zhongyuan","Tian, YJ; Xu, B; Yu, DL; Ma, YM; Wang, YB; Jiang, YB; Hu, WT; Tang, CC; Gao, YF; Luo, K; Zhao, ZS; Wang, LM; Wen, B; He, JL; Liu, ZY",385.0,"[Tian, Yongjun; Xu, Bo; Yu, Dongli; Hu, Wentao; Gao, Yufei; Luo, Kun; Zhao, Zhisheng; Wang, Li-Min; Wen, Bin; He, Julong; Liu, Zhongyuan] Yanshan Univ, State Key Lab Metastable Mat Sci & Technol, Qinhuangdao 066004, Peoples R China; [Ma, Yanming] Jilin Univ, State Key Lab Superhard Mat, Changchun 130012, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yanbin] Univ Chicago, Ctr Adv Radiat Sources, Chicago, IL 60439 USA; [Jiang, Yingbing] Univ New Mexico, TEM Lab, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Tang, Chengchun] Hebei Univ Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Tianjin 300130, Peoples R China",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11728,Article,,fhcl@ysu.edu.cn,388,"Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2011CB808205, 2010CB731605]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51121061, 51172197, 11025418, 91022029]; US National Science Foundation [EAR-0968456]","We thank J.

40,42,193.0,"Superfluidity - liquid flow without friction - is familiar in helium. The first evidence for 'supersolidity', its analogue in quantum solids, came from torsional oscillator measurements(1,2) involving He-4. At temperatures below 200 mK, the torsional oscillator frequencies increased, suggesting that some of the solid decoupled from the oscillator. This behaviour has been replicated by several groups(3-7), but solid He-4 does not respond to pressure differences(8), and persistent currents and other signatures of superflow have not been seen. Both experiments and theory(9-14) indicate that defects are involved; these should also affect the solid's mechanical behaviour. Here we report a measurement of the shear modulus of solid He-4 at low frequencies and strains. We observe large increases below 200 mK, with the same dependence on measurement amplitude, He-3 impurity concentration and annealing as the decoupling seen in the torsional oscillator experiments. We explain this unusual elastic behaviour in terms of a dislocation network that is pinned by He-3 at the lowest temperatures but becomes mobile above 100 mK. The frequency changes in the torsional oscillator experiments appear to be related to the motion of these dislocations, perhaps by disrupting a possible supersolid state.","Day, James; Beamish, John","Day, J; Beamish, J",853.0,"Univ Alberta, Dept Phys, Edmonton, AB T6G 2G7, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06383,Article,,beamish@phys.ualberta.ca,856,,,237RU,Y,N,HCP HE-4; SOUND-VELOCITY; BCC HE-3; DISLOCATIONS; IMPURITIES; CRYSTALS; HELIUM,7171.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,"Day, James/0000-0003-4324-3486","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",6-Dec,4.0,LONDON,18064007.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007.0,,"Beamish, J (reprint author), Univ Alberta, Dept Phys, Edmonton, AB T6G 2G7, Canada.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,224.0,Low-temperature shear modulus changes in solid He-4 and connection to supersolidity,1.0,23.0,WOS:000251394900050,193.0,450,Multidisciplinary Sciences,224,john,beamish,2260.0,9931,male,0.99,INKXvRsAAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",604590,1,604590,1,Beamish Museum,Beamish Museum,1,1
41,129,162.0,"Neurotensin (NTS) is a 13-amino-acid peptide that functions as both a neurotransmitter and a hormone through the activation of the neurotensin receptor NTSR1, a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). In the brain, NTS modulates the activity of dopaminergic systems, opioid-independent analgesia, and the inhibition of food intake; in the gut, NTS regulates a range of digestive processes. Here we present the structure at 2.8 angstrom resolution of Rattus norvegicus NTSR1 in an active-like state, bound to NTS8-13, the carboxy-terminal portion of NTS responsible for agonist-induced activation of the receptor. The peptide agonist binds to NTSR1 in an extended conformation nearly perpendicular to the membrane plane, with the C terminus oriented towards the receptor core. Our findings provide, to our knowledge, the first insight into the binding mode of a peptide agonist to a GPCR and may support the development of non-peptide ligands that could be useful in the treatment of neurological disorders, cancer and obesity.","White, Jim F.; Noinaj, Nicholas; Shibata, Yoko; Love, James; Kloss, Brian; Xu, Feng; Gvozdenovic-Jeremic, Jelena; Shah, Priyanka; Shiloach, Joseph; Tate, Christopher G.; Grisshammer, Reinhard","White, JF; Noinaj, N; Shibata, Y; Love, J; Kloss, B; Xu, F; Gvozdenovic-Jeremic, J; Shah, P; Shiloach, J; Tate, CG; Grisshammer, R",508.0,"[White, Jim F.; Xu, Feng; Gvozdenovic-Jeremic, Jelena; Shah, Priyanka; Grisshammer, Reinhard] Natl Inst Neurol Disorders & Stroke, Membrane Prot Struct Funct Unit, NIH, US Dept HHS, Rockville, MD 20852 USA; [Noinaj, Nicholas] NIDDKD, Mol Biol Lab, NIH, US Dept HHS, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Shibata, Yoko; Tate, Christopher G.] MRC, Mol Biol Lab, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England; [Love, James; Kloss, Brian] New York Struct Biol Ctr, New York Consortium Membrane Prot Struct, Prot Prod Facil, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Shiloach, Joseph] NIDDKD, Biotechnol Core Lab, NIH, US Dept HHS, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11558,Article,,rkgriss@helix.nih.gov,+,"National Institutes of Health (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke); National Institutes of Health (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases); Pfizer Global Research and Development; MRCT Development Gap Fund; UK Medical Research Council [MRC U105197215]; National Institutes of Health [U54GM075026]; NIH Roadmap grant [P50 GM073197]; US Department of Energy, Basic Energy Sciences, Office of Science [DE-AC02-06CH11357]","This research was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institutes of Health (J.F.W., J.G.-J., P.S. and R.G.: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke; N.N. and J.S.: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) and a joint grant from Pfizer Global Research and Development and the MRCT Development Gap Fund in addition to core funding from the UK Medical Research Council MRC U105197215 (Y.S., C.G.T.).

42,1,0.0,"The El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) system during the Pliocene warm period (PWP; 3-5 million years ago) may have existed in a permanent El Nino state with a sharply reduced zonal sea surface temperature (SST) gradient in the equatorial Pacific Ocean(1). This suggests that during the PWP, when global mean temperatures and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations were similar to those projected for near-term climate change(2), ENSO variability-and related global climate teleconnections-could have been radically different from that today. Yet, owing to a lack of observational evidence on seasonal and interannual SST variability from crucial low-latitude sites, this fundamental climate characteristic of the PWP remains controversial(1,3-10). Here we show that permanent El Nino conditions did not exist during the PWP. Our spectral analysis of the delta(18)O SST and salinity proxy, extracted from two 35-year, monthly resolved PWP Porites corals in the Philippines, reveals variability that is similar to present ENSO variation. Although our fossil corals cannot be directly compared with modern ENSO records, two lines of evidence suggest that Philippine corals are appropriate ENSO proxies. First, delta(18)O anomalies from a nearby live Porites coral are correlated with modern records of ENSO variability. Second, negative-delta(18)O events in the fossil corals closely resemble the decreases in delta(18)O seen in the live coral during El Nino events. Prior research advocating a permanent El Nino state may have been limited by the coarse resolution of many SST proxies, whereas our coral-based analysis identifies climate variability at the temporal scale required to resolve ENSO structure firmly.","Watanabe, Tsuyoshi; Suzuki, Atsushi; Minobe, Shoshiro; Kawashima, Tatsunori; Kameo, Koji; Minoshima, Kayo; Aguilar, Yolanda M.; Wani, Ryoji; Kawahata, Hodaka; Sowa, Kohki; Nagai, Takaya; Kase, Tomoki","Watanabe, T; Suzuki, A; Minobe, S; Kawashima, T; Kameo, K; Minoshima, K; Aguilar, YM; Wani, R; Kawahata, H; Sowa, K; Nagai, T; Kase, T",209.0,"[Watanabe, Tsuyoshi; Minobe, Shoshiro; Kawashima, Tatsunori; Sowa, Kohki; Nagai, Takaya] Hokkaido Univ, Dept Nat Hist Sci, Fac Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan; [Suzuki, Atsushi; Minoshima, Kayo] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Geol Survey Japan, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058567, Japan; [Kameo, Koji] Chiba Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Fac Sci, Chiba 2638522, Japan; [Aguilar, Yolanda M.] Mines & Geosci Bur, Petrolab, Quezon City 1101, Philippines; [Wani, Ryoji] Yokohama Natl Univ, Interdisciplinary Res Ctr, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2408501, Japan; [Kawahata, Hodaka] Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, Kashiwa, Chiba 2775564, Japan; [Kase, Tomoki] Natl Museum Nat & Sci, Dept Geol & Paleontol, Tokyo 1690073, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09777,Article,,nabe@mail.sci.hokudai.ac.jp,211,,,732FK,,,SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; SOUTHERN-OSCILLATION; TROPICAL PACIFIC; CLIMATE; VARIABILITY; PRECIPITATION; PATTERNS; EPOCH,7337.0,NATURE,Nature,English,23.0,No,"Minobe, Shoshiro/0000-0002-9487-9006; KAWAHATA, HODAKA/0000-0003-4236-7356; Wani, Ryoji/0000-0002-3733-769X","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",10-Mar,3.0,LONDON,21390128.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2011.0,"Watanabe, Tsuyoshi/A-5741-2012; Minobe, Shoshiro/E-2997-2010; Nagai, Takaya/C-3428-2011; Minoshima, Kaoru/G-1435-2013; kohki, sowa/D-2955-2011; KAWAHATA, HODAKA/F-9065-2016","Watanabe, T (reprint author), Hokkaido Univ, Dept Nat Hist Sci, Fac Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,60.0,Permanent El Nino during the Pliocene warm period not supported by coral evidence,2.0,51.0,WOS:000288170200035,0.0,471,Multidisciplinary Sciences,62,tomoki,kase,1578.0,4,male,1.0,hWANX-AAAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
43,49,128.0,"Neural activity increases local blood flow in the central nervous system (CNS), which is the basis of BOLD (blood oxygen level dependent) and PET (positron emission tomography) functional imaging techniques(1-3). Blood flow is assumed to be regulated by precapillary arterioles, because capillaries lack smooth muscle. However, most (65%) noradrenergic innervation of CNS blood vessels terminates near capillaries rather than arterioles(4), and in muscle and brain a dilatory signal propagates from vessels near metabolically active cells to precapillary arterioles(5,6), suggesting that blood flow control is initiated in capillaries. Pericytes, which are apposed to CNS capillaries and contain contractile proteins(7), could initiate such signalling. Here we show that pericytes can control capillary diameter in whole retina and cerebellar slices. Electrical stimulation of retinal pericytes evoked a localized capillary constriction, which propagated at similar to 2 mu m s(-1) to constrict distant pericytes. Superfused ATP in retina or noradrenaline in cerebellum resulted in constriction of capillaries by pericytes, and glutamate reversed the constriction produced by noradrenaline. Electrical stimulation or puffing GABA (gamma-amino butyric acid) receptor blockers in the inner retina also evoked pericyte constriction. In simulated ischaemia, some pericytes constricted capillaries. Pericytes are probably modulators of blood flow in response to changes in neural activity, which may contribute to functional imaging signals and to CNS vascular disease.","Peppiatt, Claire M.; Howarth, Clare; Mobbs, Peter; Attwell, David","Peppiatt, CM; Howarth, C; Mobbs, P; Attwell, D",700.0,"UCL, Dept Physiol, London WC1E 6BT, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature05193,Article,,D.Attwell@ucl.ac.uk,704,"Wellcome Trust [, 017948, 075232]",,093HX,,,RAT RETINA; CONTAINING MICROVASCULATURE; BLOOD-FLOW; IN-VIVO; BRAIN; CALCIUM; MUSCLE; CORTEX; CELLS,7112.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,"Peppiatt-Wildman, Claire/0000-0002-4406-8571","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",12-Oct,5.0,LONDON,17036005.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,,"Attwell, D (reprint author), UCL, Dept Physiol, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,437.0,Bidirectional control of CNS capillary diameter by pericytes,7.0,50.0,WOS:000241160500048,128.0,443,Multidisciplinary Sciences,455,david,attwell,2398.0,12593,male,1.0,PpRdCfQAAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",33588185,1,1804463,1,David Attwell,David Attwell,1,1
44,115,479.0,"Folate receptors (FR alpha, FR beta and FR gamma) are cysteine-rich cell-surface glycoproteins that bind folate with high affinity to mediate cellular uptake of folate. Although expressed at very low levels in most tissues, folate receptors, especially FR alpha, are expressed at high levels in numerous cancers to meet the folate demand of rapidly dividing cells under low folate conditions(1-3). The folate dependency of many tumours has been therapeutically and diagnostically exploited by administration of anti-FR alpha antibodies, high-affinity antifolates(4,5), folate-based imaging agents and folate-conjugated drugs and toxins(6-8). To understand how folate binds its receptors, we determined the crystal structure of human FR alpha in complex with folic acid at 2.8 angstrom resolution. FR alpha has a globular structure stabilized by eight disulphide bonds and contains a deep open folate-binding pocket comprised of residues that are conserved in all receptor subtypes. The folate pteroate moiety is buried inside the receptor, whereas its glutamate moiety is solvent-exposed and sticks out of the pocket entrance, allowing it to be conjugated to drugs without adversely affecting FR alpha binding. The extensive interactions between the receptor and ligand readily explain the high folate-binding affinity of folate receptors and provide a template for designing more specific drugs targeting the folate receptor system.","Chen, Chen; Ke, Jiyuan; Zhou, X.

46,141,204.0,"The biogeochemical cycles of iron and organic carbon are strongly interlinked. In oceanic waters, organic ligands have been shown to control the concentration of dissolved iron(1). In soils, solid iron phases shelter and preserve organic carbon(2), but the role of iron in the preservation of organic matter in sediments has not been clearly established. Here we use an iron reduction method previously applied to soils(3) to determine the amount of organic carbon associated with reactive iron phases in sediments of various mineralogies collected from a wide range of depositional environments. Our findings suggest that 21.5 +/- 8.6 per cent of the organic carbon in sediments is directly bound to reactive iron phases. We further estimate that a global mass of (19-45) x 10(15) grams of organic carbon is preserved in surface marine sediments as a result of its association with iron(4). We propose that these associations between organic carbon and iron, which are formed primarily through co-precipitation and/or direct chelation, promote the preservation of organic carbon in sediments. Because reactive iron phases are metastable over geological timescales, we suggest that they serve as an efficient 'rusty sink' for organic carbon, acting as a key factor in the long-term storage of organic carbon and thus contributing to the global cycles of carbon, oxygen and sulphur(5).","Lalonde, Karine; Mucci, Alfonso; Ouellet, Alexandre; Gelinas, Yves","Lalonde, K; Mucci, A; Ouellet, A; Gelinas, Y",198.0,"[Lalonde, Karine; Ouellet, Alexandre; Gelinas, Yves] Concordia Univ, GEOTOP, Montreal, PQ H4B 1R6, Canada; [Lalonde, Karine; Ouellet, Alexandre; Gelinas, Yves] Concordia Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem, Montreal, PQ H4B 1R6, Canada; [Mucci, Alfonso] McGill Univ, GEOTOP, Montreal, PQ H3A 2A7, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10855,Article,,ygelinas@alcor.concordia.ca,200,NSERC; CFI; FQRNT,"This work is dedicated to the memory of J.I.

47,39,59.0,"A piezoelectric material is one that generates a voltage in response to a mechanical strain ( and vice versa). The most useful piezoelectric materials display a transition region in their composition phase diagrams, known as a morphotropic phase boundary(1,2), where the crystal structure changes abruptly and the electromechanical properties are maximal. As a result, modern piezoelectric materials for technological applications are usually complex, engineered, solid solutions, which complicates their manufacture as well as introducing complexity in the study of the microscopic origins of their properties. Here we show that even a pure compound, in this case lead titanate, can display a morphotropic phase boundary under pressure. The results are consistent with first-principles theoretical predictions(3), but show a richer phase diagram than anticipated; moreover, the predicted electromechanical coupling at the transition is larger than any known. Our results show that the high electromechanical coupling in solid solutions with lead titanate is due to tuning of the high- pressure morphotropic phase boundary in pure lead titanate to ambient pressure. We also find that complex microstructures or compositions are not necessary to obtain strong piezoelectricity. This opens the door to the possible discovery of high- performance, pure-compound electromechanical materials, which could greatly decrease costs and expand the utility of piezoelectric materials.","Ahart, Muhtar; Somayazulu, Maddury; Cohen, R.

48,135,465.0,"In the prehistoric green Sahara of Holocene North Africa-in contrast to the Neolithic of Europe and Eurasia-a reliance on cattle, sheep and goats emerged as a stable and widespread way of life, long before the first evidence for domesticated plants or settled village farming communities(1-3). The remarkable rock art found widely across the region depicts cattle herding among early Saharan pastoral groups, and includes rare scenes of milking; however, these images can rarely be reliably dated(4). Although the faunal evidence provides further confirmation of the importance of cattle and other domesticates(5), the scarcity of cattle bones makes it impossible to ascertain herd structures via kill-off patterns, thereby precluding interpretations of whether dairying was practiced. Because pottery production begins early in northern Africa(6) the potential exists to investigate diet and subsistence practices using molecular and isotopic analyses of absorbed food residues(7). This approach has been successful in determining the chronology of dairying beginning in the 'Fertile Crescent' of the Near East and its spread across Europe(8-11). Here we report the first unequivocal chemical evidence, based on the delta C-13 and Delta C-13 values of the major alkanoic acids of milk fat, for the adoption of dairying practices by prehistoric Saharan African people in the fifth millennium BC. Interpretations are supported by a new database of modern ruminant animal fats collected from Africa. These findings confirm the importance of 'lifetime products', such as milk, in early Saharan pastoralism, and provide an evolutionary context for the emergence of lactase persistence in Africa.","Dunne, Julie; Evershed, Richard P.; Salque, Melanie; Cramp, Lucy; Bruni, Silvia; Ryan, Kathleen; Biagetti, Stefano; di Lernia, Savino","Dunne, J; Evershed, RP; Salque, M; Cramp, L; Bruni, S; Ryan, K; Biagetti, S; di Lernia, S",390.0,"[Dunne, Julie; Evershed, Richard P.; Salque, Melanie; Cramp, Lucy] Univ Bristol, Sch Chem, Organ Geochem Unit, Bristol BS8 1TS, Avon, England; [Bruni, Silvia] Univ Milan, Dipartimento Chim Inorgan Metallorgan & Analit La, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Ryan, Kathleen] Univ Penn, African Sect, Museum Archaeol & Anthropol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Biagetti, Stefano; di Lernia, Savino] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Sci Antichita, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [di Lernia, Savino] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Geog Archaeology& Environm Sci, ZA-2050 Wits, South Africa",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11186,Article,,r.p.evershed@bristol.ac.uk; Savino.Dilernia@uniroma1.it,394,"UK Natural Environment Research Council; Sapienza, University of Rome (Grandi Scavi di Ateneo); Minister of Foreign Affairs (DGSP); USA National Science Foundation; Royal Society","We thank the UK Natural Environment Research Council for a PhD studentship to J.

49,153,126.0,"DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in repetitive sequences are a potent source of genomic instability, owing to the possibility of non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR). Repetitive sequences are especially at risk during meiosis, when numerous programmed DSBs are introduced into the genome to initiate meiotic recombination(1). In the repetitive ribosomal DNA (rDNA) array of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, meiotic DSB formation is prevented in part through Sir2-dependent heterochromatin formation(2,3). Here we show that the edges of the rDNA array are exceptionally susceptible to meiotic DSBs, revealing an inherent heterogeneity in the rDNA array. We find that this localized DSB susceptibility necessitates a border-specific protection system consisting of the meiotic ATPase Pch2 and the origin recognition complex subunit Orc1. Upon disruption of these factors, DSB formation and recombination increased specifically in the outermost rDNA repeats, leading to NAHR and rDNA instability. Notably, the Sir2-dependent heterochromatin of the rDNA itself was responsible for the induction of DSBs at the rDNA borders in pch2 Delta cells. Thus, although the activity of Sir2 globally prevents meiotic DSBs in the rDNA, it creates a highly permissive environment for DSB formation at the junctions between heterochromatin and euchromatin. Heterochromatinized repetitive DNA arrays are abundant in most eukaryotic genomes. Our data define the borders of such chromatin domains as distinct high-risk regions for meiotic NAHR, the protection of which may be a universal requirement to prevent meiotic genome rearrangements that are associated with genomic diseases and birth defects.","Vader, Gerben; Blitzblau, Hannah G.; Tame, Mihoko A.; Falk, Jill E.; Curtin, Lisa; Hochwagen, Andreas","Vader, G; Blitzblau, HG; Tame, MA; Falk, JE; Curtin, L; Hochwagen, A",115.0,"[Vader, Gerben; Blitzblau, Hannah G.; Tame, Mihoko A.; Falk, Jill E.; Curtin, Lisa; Hochwagen, Andreas] Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge Ctr 9, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Curtin, Lisa] Somerville High Sch, Somerville, MA 02143 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10331,Article,,andi@nyu.edu,U141,"NIH [GM088248]; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research [NWO Rubicon-825.08.009, NWO VENI-016.111.004]; HHMI [52005879]","We thank S.

50,92,291.0,"Quantum computers promise dramatic advantages over their classical counterparts, but the source of the power in quantum computing has remained elusive. Here we prove a remarkable equivalence between the onset of contextuality and the possibility of universal quantum computation via 'magic state' distillation, which is the leading model for experimentally realizing a fault-tolerant quantum computer. This is a conceptually satisfying link, because contextuality, which precludes a simple 'hidden variable' model of quantum mechanics, provides one of the fundamental characterizations of uniquely quantum phenomena. Furthermore, this connection suggests a unifying paradigm for the resources of quantum information: the non-locality of quantum theory is a particular kind of contextuality, and non-locality is already known to be a critical resource for achieving advantages with quantum communication. In addition to clarifying these fundamental issues, this work advances the resource framework for quantum computation, which has a number of practical applications, such as characterizing the efficiency and trade-offs between distinct theoretical and experimental schemes for achieving robust quantum computation, and putting bounds on the overhead cost for the classical simulation of quantum algorithms.","Howard, Mark; Wallman, Joel; Veitch, Victor; Emerson, Joseph","Howard, M; Wallman, J; Veitch, V; Emerson, J",351.0,"[Howard, Mark] Natl Univ Ireland, Dept Math Phys, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland; [Howard, Mark; Wallman, Joel; Veitch, Victor; Emerson, Joseph] Univ Waterloo, Inst Quantum Comp, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Howard, Mark; Wallman, Joel; Veitch, Victor; Emerson, Joseph] Univ Waterloo, Dept Appl Math, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Veitch, Victor] Univ Toronto, Dept Stat, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13460,Article,1476-4687,jemerson@math.uwaterloo.ca,355,Irish Research Council (IRC) as part of the Empower Fellowship programme; CIFAR; Government of Canada through NSERC,"M.H. was supported by the Irish Research Council (IRC) as part of the Empower Fellowship programme, and all authors acknowledge support from CIFAR and the Government of Canada through NSERC.",AJ0NG,Y,N,HIDDEN-VARIABLES; MECHANICS; COMPUTER,7505.0,NATURE,Nature,English,48.0,No,"Wallman, Joel/0000-0001-6943-5334; Howard, Mark/0000-0002-6910-185X","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",19-Jun,5.0,LONDON,24919152.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2014.0,,"Emerson, J (reprint author), Univ Waterloo, Inst Quantum Comp, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,88.0,Contextuality supplies the 'magic' for quantum computation,4.0,44.0,WOS:000337350200026,291.0,510,Multidisciplinary Sciences,89,joseph,emerson,4124.0,2213,male,0.99,n8S2KokAAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",46463476,1,26202,1,Joseph Emerson,Joseph Emerson,1,1
51,33,449.0,"To understand the processes that regulate the abundance and persistence of wild populations is a fundamental goal of ecology and a prerequisite for the management of living resources. Variable abundance data, however, make the demonstration of regulation processes challenging(1-3). A previously overlooked aspect in understanding how populations are regulated(4-6) is the possibility that the pattern of variability - its strength as a function of population size - may be more than 'noise', thus revealing much about the characteristics of population regulation. Here we show that patterns in survival variability do provide evidence of regulation through density. Using a large, global compilation of marine, anadromous and freshwater fisheries data, we examine the relationship between the variability of survival and population abundance. The interannual variability in progeny survival increases at low adult abundance in an inversely density- dependent fashion. This pattern is consistent with models in which density dependence enters after the larval stage. The findings are compatible with very simple forms of density dependence: even a linear increase of juvenile mortality with adult density adequately explains the results. The model predictions explain why populations with strong regulation may experience large increases in variability at low densities(7). Furthermore, the inverse relationship between survival variability and the strength of density dependence has important consequences for fisheries management and recovery, and population persistence or extinction(8-10).","Minto, Coilin; Myers, Ransom A.; Blanchard, Wade","Minto, C; Myers, RA; Blanchard, W",344.0,"[Minto, Coilin] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS B3H 4J1, Canada; [Blanchard, Wade] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Halifax, NS B3H 3J5, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06605,Article,,mintoc@mathstat.dal.ca,U6,,,276BX,,,MARINE DEMERSAL FISH; DEPENDENCE; RECRUITMENT; MORTALITY; TIME; COD; AGE,7185.0,NATURE,Nature,English,33.0,No,"Minto, Coilin/0000-0003-0630-6775","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",20-Mar,5.0,LONDON,18354480.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,,"Minto, C (reprint author), Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS B3H 4J1, Canada.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,51.0,Survival variability and population density in fish populations,2.0,66.0,WOS:000254117400045,449.0,452,Multidisciplinary Sciences,52,wade,blanchard,1987.0,157,male,1.0,SBPYOOMAAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",38633853,1,184420,1,Mary Hazelton Blanchard Wade,Mary Hazelton Blanchard Wade,1,1
52,9,42.0,"The modern giant sperm whale Physeter macrocephalus, one of the largest known predators, preys upon cephalopods at great depths(1,2). Lacking a functional upper dentition, it relies on suction for catching its prey(3); in contrast, several smaller Miocene sperm whales (Physeteroidea) have been interpreted as raptorial (versus suction) feeders(4,5), analogous to the modern killer whale Orcinus orca. Whereas very large physeteroid teeth have been discovered in various Miocene localities, associated diagnostic cranial remains have not been found so far(6-8). Here we report the discovery of a new giant sperm whale from the Middle Miocene of Peru (approximately 12-13 million years ago), Leviathan melvillei, described on the basis of a skull with teeth and mandible. With a 3-m-long head, very large upper and lower teeth (maximum diameter and length of 12 cm and greater than 36 cm, respectively), robust jaws and a temporal fossa considerably larger than in Physeter, this stem physeteroid represents one of the largest raptorial predators and, to our knowledge, the biggest tetrapod bite ever found. The appearance of gigantic raptorial sperm whales in the fossil record coincides with a phase of diversification and size-range increase of the baleen-bearing mysticetes in the Miocene. We propose that Leviathan fed mostly on high-energy content medium-size baleen whales. As a top predator, together with the contemporaneous giant shark Carcharocles megalodon, it probably had a profound impact on the structuring of Miocene marine communities. The development of a vast supracranial basin in Leviathan, extending on the rostrum as in Physeter, might indicate the presence of an enlarged spermaceti organ in the former that is not associated with deep diving or obligatory suction feeding.","Lambert, Olivier; Bianucci, Giovanni; Post, Klaas; de Muizon, Christian; Salas-Gismondi, Rodolfo; Urbina, Mario; Reumer, Jelle","Lambert, O; Bianucci, G; Post, K; de Muizon, C; Salas-Gismondi, R; Urbina, M; Reumer, J",105.0,"[Lambert, Olivier] Inst Royal Sci Nat Belgique, Dept Paleontol, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [Bianucci, Giovanni] Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Sci Terra, I-56126 Pisa, Italy; [Post, Klaas; Reumer, Jelle] Nat Hist Museum Rotterdam, NL-3001 KL Rotterdam, Netherlands; [de Muizon, Christian] Museum Natl Hist Nat, Dept Hist Terre, F-75005 Paris, France; [Salas-Gismondi, Rodolfo; Urbina, Mario] Univ Nacl Mayor San Marcos, Museo Hist Nat, Lima 14, Peru; [Reumer, Jelle] Univ Utrecht, Dept Geosci, NL-3508 TA Utrecht, Netherlands",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09067,Article,,olambert@mnhn.fr; bianucci@dst.unipi.it,108,Board of the Natuurhistorisch Museum Rotterdam Foundation; Belgian Federal Science Policy Office,"We thank W.

53,102,110.0,"To resolve the mechanisms that switch competition to cooperation is key to understanding biological organization(1). This is particularly relevant for intrasexual competition, which often leads to males harming females(2). Recent theory proposes that kin selection may modulate female harm by relaxing competition among male relatives(3-5). Here we experimentally manipulate the relatedness of groups of male Drosophila melanogaster competing over females to demonstrate that, as expected, within-group relatedness inhibits male competition and female harm. Females exposed to groups of three brothers unrelated to the female had higher lifetime reproductive success and slower reproductive ageing compared to females exposed to groups of three males unrelated to each other. Triplets of brothers also fought less with each other, courted females less intensively and lived longer than triplets of unrelated males. However, associations among brothers may be vulnerable to invasion by minorities of unrelated males: when two brothers were matched with an unrelated male, the unrelated male sired on average twice as many offspring as either brother. These results demonstrate that relatedness can profoundly affect fitness through its modulation of intrasexual competition, as flies plastically adjust sexual behaviour in a manner consistent with kin-selection theory.","Carazo, Pau; Tan, Cedric K.

54,20,310.0,"Replication forks are impeded by DNA damage and protein - nucleic acid complexes such as transcribing RNA polymerase. For example, head- on collision of the replisome with RNA polymerase results in replication fork arrest. However, co- directional collision of the replisome with RNA polymerase has little or no effect on fork progression. Here we examine co- directional collisions between a replisome and RNA polymerase in vitro. We show that the Escherichia coli replisome uses the RNAtranscript as a primer to continue leading- strand synthesis after the collision with RNA polymerase that is displaced from the DNA. This action results in a discontinuity in the leading strand, yet the replisome remains intact and bound to DNA during the entire process. These findings underscore the notable plasticity by which the replisome operates to circumvent obstacles in its path and may explain why the leading strand is synthesized discontinuously in vivo.","Pomerantz, Richard T.; O'Donnell, Mike","Pomerantz, RT; O'Donnell, M",762.0,"[Pomerantz, Richard T.; O'Donnell, Mike] Rockefeller Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10021 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07527,Article,,odonnell@mail.rockefeller.edu,U51,National Institutes of Health; Marie-Josee and Henry Kravis Fellowship at the Rockefeller University,"We are grateful to W.

56,122,372.0,"The extinction rate of populations is predicted to rise under increasing rates of environmental change(1-3). If a population experiencing increasingly stressful conditions lacks appropriate phenotypic plasticity or access to more suitable habitats, then genetic change may be the only way to avoid extinction(1). Evolutionary rescue from extinction occurs when natural selection enriches a population for more stress-tolerant genetic variants(1,3). Some experimental studies have shown that lower rates of environmental change lead to more adapted populations or fewer extinctions(4-9). However, there has been little focus on the genetic changes that underlie evolutionary rescue. Here we demonstrate that some evolutionary trajectories are contingent on a lower rate of environmental change. We allowed hundreds of populations of Escherichia coli to evolve under variable rates of increase in concentration of the antibiotic rifampicin. We then genetically engineered all combinations of mutations from isolates evolved under lower rates of environmental change. By assessing fitness of these engineered strains across a range of drug concentrations, we show that certain genotypes are evolutionarily inaccessible under rapid environmental change. Rapidly deteriorating environments not only limit mutational opportunities by lowering population size, but they can also eliminate sets of mutations as evolutionary options. As anthropogenic activities are leading to environmental change at unprecedented rapidity(1), it is critical to understand how the rate of environmental change affects both demographic and genetic underpinnings of evolutionary rescue.","Lindsey, Haley A.; Gallie, Jenna; Taylor, Susan; Kerr, Benjamin","Lindsey, HA; Gallie, J; Taylor, S; Kerr, B",463.0,"[Lindsey, Haley A.; Gallie, Jenna; Taylor, Susan; Kerr, Benjamin] Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Lindsey, Haley A.; Gallie, Jenna; Taylor, Susan; Kerr, Benjamin] Univ Washington, BEACON Ctr Study Evolut Act, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Gallie, Jenna] Eawag, Dept Environm Microbiol, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Gallie, Jenna] ETH, Dept Environm Syst Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11879,Article,1476-4687,kerrb@uw.edu,467,National Science Foundation [DBI-0939454]; NSF CAREER [DEB0952825]; UW Royalty Research Fund [A74107],"We thank T.

57,136,494.0,"The isotopes Xe-129, produced from the radioactive decay of extinct I-129, and Xe-136, produced from extinct Pu-244 and extant U-238, have provided important constraints on early mantle outgassing and volatile loss from Earth(1,2). The low ratios of radiogenic to non-radiogenic xenon (Xe-129/Xe-130) in ocean island basalts (OIBs) compared with mid-ocean-ridge basalts (MORBs) have been used as evidence for the existence of a relatively undegassed primitive deep-mantle reservoir(1). However, the low Xe-129/Xe-130 ratios in OIBs have also been attributed to mixing between subducted atmospheric Xe and MORB Xe, which obviates the need for a less degassed deep-mantle reservoir(3,4). Here I present new noble gas (He, Ne, Ar, Xe) measurements from an Icelandic OIB that reveal differences in elemental abundances and Ne-20/Ne-22 ratios between the Iceland mantle plume and the MORB source. These observations show that the lower Xe-129/Xe-130 ratios in OIBs are due to a lower I/Xe ratio in the OIB mantle source and cannot be explained solely by mixing atmospheric Xe with MORB-type Xe. Because I-129 became extinct about 100 million years after the formation of the Solar System, OIB and MORB mantle sources must have differentiated by 4.45 billion years ago and subsequent mixing must have been limited. The Iceland plume source also has a higher proportion of Pu- to U-derived fission Xe, requiring the plume source to be less degassed than MORBs, a conclusion that is independent of noble gas concentrations and the partitioning behaviour of the noble gases with respect to their radiogenic parents. Overall, these results show that Earth's mantle accreted volatiles from at least two separate sources and that neither the Moon-forming impact nor 4.45 billion years of mantle convection has erased the signature of Earth's heterogeneous accretion and early differentiation.","Mukhopadhyay, Sujoy","Mukhopadhyay, S",101.0,"Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11141,Article,,sujoy@eps.harvard.edu,U124,NSF [EAR 0911363],"I thank D.

58,103,140.0,"Measured rates of river incision into bedrock are commonly interpreted as proxies for rates of rock uplift (see refs 1 and 2, for example) and indices of the strength of climatic forcing of erosion over time (see refs 3 and 4, for example). This approach implicitly assumes that river incision rates are in equilibrium with external forcings over a wide range of timescales. Here we directly test this assumption by examining the temporal scaling of bedrock river incision from 155 independent measurements of river incision compiled from 14 sites. Of these sites, 11 exhibit a negative power-law dependence of bedrock river incision rate on measurement interval, a relationship that is apparent over timescales of 10(4)-10(7) years and is independent of tectonic and geomorphic setting. Thus, like rates of sediment accumulation(5), rates of river incision into bedrock exhibit non-steady-state behaviour even over very long measurement intervals. Non-steady-state behaviour can be explained by episodic hiatuses in river incision triggered by alluvial deposition, if such hiatuses have a heavy-tailed length distribution(6). Regardless of its cause, the dependence of incision rate on measurement interval complicates efforts to infer tectonic or climatic forcing from changes in rates of river incision over time or from comparison of rates computed over different timescales.","Finnegan, Noah J.; Schumer, Rina; Finnegan, Seth","Finnegan, NJ; Schumer, R; Finnegan, S",391.0,"[Finnegan, Noah J.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Schumer, Rina] Desert Res Inst, Div Hydrol Sci, Reno, NV 89512 USA; [Finnegan, Seth] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12913,Article,1476-4687,nfinnega@ucsc.edu,+,National Science Foundation [EAR-1049889],"This study was supported in part by the National Science Foundation (EAR-1049889).

59,18,494.0,"Techniques to detect and quantify DNA and RNA molecules in biological samples have had a central role in genomics research(1-3). Over the past decade, several techniques have been developed to improve detection performance and reduce the cost of genetic analysis(4-10). In particular, significant advances in label-free methods have been reported(11-17). Yet detection of DNA molecules at concentrations below the femtomolar level requires amplified detection schemes(1,8). Here we report a unique nanomechanical response of hybridized DNA and RNA molecules that serves as an intrinsic molecular label. Nanomechanical measurements on a microarray surface have sufficient background signal rejection to allow direct detection and counting of hybridized molecules. The digital response of the sensor provides a large dynamic range that is critical for gene expression profiling. We have measured differential expressions of microRNAs in tumour samples; such measurements have been shown to help discriminate between the tissue origins of metastatic tumours(18). Two hundred picograms of total RNA is found to be sufficient for this analysis. In addition, the limit of detection in pure samples is found to be one attomolar. These results suggest that nanomechanical read-out of microarrays promises attomolar-level sensitivity and large dynamic range for the analysis of gene expression, while eliminating biochemical manipulations, amplification and labelling.","Husale, Sudhir; Persson, Henrik H.

60,61,425.0,"Periodic somite segmentation in vertebrate embryos is controlled by the 'segmentation clock', which consists of numerous cellular oscillators. Although the properties of a single oscillator, driven by a hairy negative-feedback loop, have been investigated, the system-level properties of the segmentation clock remain largely unknown. To explore these characteristics, we have examined the response of a normally oscillating clock in zebrafish to experimental stimuli using in vivo mosaic experiments and mathematical simulation. We demonstrate that the segmentation clock behaves as a coupled oscillator, by showing that Notch-dependent intercellular communication, the activity of which is regulated by the internal hairy oscillator, couples neighbouring cells to facilitate synchronized oscillation. Furthermore, the oscillation phase of individual oscillators fluctuates due to developmental noise such as stochastic gene expression and active cell proliferation. The intercellular coupling was found to have a crucial role in minimizing the effects of this noise to maintain coherent oscillation.","Horikawa, Kazuki; Ishimatsu, Kana; Yoshimoto, Eiichi; Kondo, Shigeru; Takeda, Hiroyuki","Horikawa, K; Ishimatsu, K; Yoshimoto, E; Kondo, S; Takeda, H",719.0,"Univ Tokyo, Dept Biol Sci, Grad Sch Sci, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; Nagoya Univ, Div Biol Sci, Grad Sch Sci, Nagoya, Aichi 4648602, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature04861,Article,,kazu@biol.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp; htakeda@biol.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp,723,,,050NL,,,SOMITE SEGMENTATION; GENE-EXPRESSION; ZEBRAFISH SOMITOGENESIS; LUNATIC-FRINGE; VERTEBRATE SEGMENTATION; INDIVIDUAL FIBROBLASTS; MECHANISM; NETWORK; CELLS; HER1,7094.0,NATURE,Nature,English,44.0,No,"Horikawa, Kazuki/0000-0002-9285-4171","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",8-Jun,5.0,LONDON,16760970.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,"TAKEDA, HIROYUKI/G-4950-2014","Horikawa, K (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Dept Biol Sci, Grad Sch Sci, Hongo 7-3-1, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,161.0,Noise-resistant and synchronized oscillation of the segmentation clock,0.0,16.0,WOS:000238095100046,425.0,441,Multidisciplinary Sciences,166,hiroyuki,takeda,2324.0,29,male,1.0,91YDSugAAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",30108719,1,39665835,1,Hiroyuki Takeda,Hiroyuki Takeda,1,1
61,137,427.0,"Heart failure is characterized by a debilitating decline in cardiac function(1), and recent clinical trial results indicate that improving the contractility of heart muscle cells by boosting intracellular calcium handling might be an effective therapy(2,3). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are dysregulated in heart failure(4,5) but whether they control contractility or constitute therapeutic targets remains speculative. Using high-throughput functional screening of the human microRNAome, here we identify miRNAs that suppress intracellular calcium handling in heart muscle by interacting with messenger RNA encoding the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium uptake pump SERCA2a (also known as ATP2A2). Of 875 miRNAs tested, miR-25 potently delayed calcium uptake kinetics in cardiomyocytes in vitro and was upregulated in heart failure, both in mice and humans. Whereas adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9)-mediated overexpression of miR-25 in vivo resulted in a significant loss of contractile function, injection of an antisense oligonucleotide (antagomiR) against miR-25 markedly halted established heart failure in a mouse model, improving cardiac function and survival relative to a control antagomiR oligonucleotide. These data reveal that increased expression of endogenous miR-25 contributes to declining cardiac function during heart failure and suggest that it might be targeted therapeutically to restore function.","Wahlquist, Christine; Jeong, Dongtak; Rojas-Munoz, Agustin; Kho, Changwon; Lee, Ahyoung; Mitsuyama, Shinichi; van Mil, Alain; Park, Woo Jin; Sluijter, Joost P.

62,233,337.0,"How dynamic signalling and extensive tissue rearrangements interact to generate complex patterns and shapes during embryogenesis is poorly understood(1-3). Here we characterize the signalling events taking place during early morphogenesis of chick skeletal muscles. We show that muscle progenitors present in somites require the transient activation of NOTCH signalling to undergo terminal differentiation. The NOTCH ligand Delta1 is expressed in a mosaic pattern in neural crest cells that migrate past the somites. Gain and loss of Delta1 function in neural crest modifies NOTCH signalling in somites, which results in delayed or premature myogenesis. Our results indicate that the neural crest regulates early muscle formation by a unique mechanism that relies on the migration of Delta1-expressing neural crest cells to trigger the transient activation of NOTCH signalling in selected muscle progenitors. This dynamic signalling guarantees a balanced and progressive differentiation of the muscle progenitor pool.","Rios, Anne C.; Serralbo, Olivier; Salgado, David; Marcelle, Christophe","Rios, AC; Serralbo, O; Salgado, D; Marcelle, C",532.0,"[Rios, Anne C.; Serralbo, Olivier; Salgado, David; Marcelle, Christophe] Monash Univ, EMBL Australia, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Rios, Anne C.; Serralbo, Olivier; Salgado, David; Marcelle, Christophe] Monash Univ, ARMI, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09970,Article,,christophe.marcelle@monash.edu,U279,Agence Nationale pour le Recherche (ANR); EU,"We thank N.

63,190,262.0,"Organisms that protect their germ-cell lineages from damage often do so at considerable cost: limited metabolic resources become partitioned away from maintenance of the soma, leaving the ageing somatic tissues to navigate survival amid an environment containing damaged and poorly functioning proteins. Historically, experimental paradigms that limit reproductive investment result in lifespan extension. We proposed that germline-deficient animals might exhibit heightened protection from proteotoxic stressors in somatic tissues. We find that the forced re-investment of resources from the germ line to the soma in Caenorhabditis elegans results in elevated somatic proteasome activity, clearance of damaged proteins and increased longevity. This activity is associated with increased expression of rpn-6, a subunit of the 19S proteasome, by the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16. Ectopic expression of rpn-6 is sufficient to confer proteotoxic stress resistance and extend lifespan, indicating that rpn-6 is a candidate to correct deficiencies in age-related protein homeostasis disorders.","Vilchez, David; Morantte, Ianessa; Liu, Zheng; Douglas, Peter M.; Merkwirth, Carsten; Rodrigues, Ana P.

64,152,276.0,"Many animals, including insects, are known to use visual landmarks to orient in their environment. In Drosophila melanogaster, behavioural genetics studies have identified a higher brain structure called the central complex as being required for the fly's innate responses to vertical visual features(1) and its short-and long-term memory for visual patterns(2-4). But whether and how neurons of the fly central complex represent visual features are unknown. Here we use two-photon calcium imaging in head-fixed walking and flying flies to probe visuomotor responses of ring neurons-a class of central complex neurons that have been implicated in landmark-driven spatial memory in walking flies(2,3) and memory for visual patterns in tethered flying flies(5). We show that dendrites of ring neurons are visually responsive and arranged retinotopically. Ring neuron receptive fields comprise both excitatory and inhibitory subfields, resembling those of simple cells in the mammalian primary visual cortex. Ring neurons show strong and, in some cases, direction-selective orientation tuning, with a notable preference for vertically oriented features similar to those that evoke innate responses in flies(1,2). Visual responses were diminished during flight, but, in contrast with the hypothesized role of the central complex in the control of locomotion(6), not modulated during walking. Taken together, these results indicate that ring neurons represent behaviourally relevant visual features in the fly's environment, enabling downstream central complex circuits to produce appropriate motor commands(6). More broadly, this study opens the door to mechanistic investigations of circuit computations underlying visually guided action selection in the Drosophila central complex.","Seelig, Johannes D.; Jayaraman, Vivek","Seelig, JD; Jayaraman, V",262.0,"[Seelig, Johannes D.; Jayaraman, Vivek] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12601,Article,1476-4687,vivek@janelia.hhmi.org,+,Howard Hughes Medical Institute,"We thank A.

65,4,96.0,"Imprinted genes, defined by their preferential expression of a single parental allele, represent a subset of the mammalian genome and often have key roles in embryonic development(1), but also postnatal functions including energy homeostasis(2) and behaviour(3,4). When the two parental alleles are unequally represented within a social group (when there is sex bias in dispersal and/or variance in reproductive success)(5,6), imprinted genes may evolve to modulate social behaviour, although so far no such instance is known. Predominantly expressed from the maternal allele during embryogenesis, Grb10 encodes an intracellular adaptor protein that can interact with several receptor tyrosine kinases and downstream signalling molecules(7). Here we demonstrate that within the brain Grb10 is expressed from the paternal allele from fetal life into adulthood and that ablation of this expression engenders increased social dominance specifically among other aspects of social behaviour, a finding supported by the observed increase in allogrooming by paternal Grb10-deficient animals. Grb10 is, therefore, the first example of an imprinted gene that regulates social behaviour. It is also currently alone in exhibiting imprinted expression from each of the parental alleles in a tissue-specific manner, as loss of the peripherally expressed maternal allele leads to significant fetal and placental overgrowth. Thus Grb10 is, so far, a unique imprinted gene, able to influence distinct physiological processes, fetal growth and adult behaviour, owing to actions of the two parental alleles in different tissues.","Garfield, Alastair S.; Cowley, Michael; Smith, Florentia M.; Moorwood, Kim; Stewart-Cox, Joanne E.; Gilroy, Kerry; Baker, Sian; Xia, Jing; Dalley, Jeffrey W.; Hurst, Laurence D.; Wilkinson, Lawrence S.; Isles, Anthony R.; Ward, Andrew","Garfield, AS; Cowley, M; Smith, FM; Moorwood, K; Stewart-Cox, JE; Gilroy, K; Baker, S; Xia, J; Dalley, JW; Hurst, LD; Wilkinson, LS; Isles, AR; Ward, A",534.0,"[Garfield, Alastair S.; Cowley, Michael; Smith, Florentia M.; Moorwood, Kim; Stewart-Cox, Joanne E.; Hurst, Laurence D.; Ward, Andrew] Univ Bath, Dept Biol & Biochem, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Garfield, Alastair S.; Cowley, Michael; Smith, Florentia M.; Moorwood, Kim; Stewart-Cox, Joanne E.; Hurst, Laurence D.; Ward, Andrew] Univ Bath, Ctr Regenerat Med, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Garfield, Alastair S.; Gilroy, Kerry; Baker, Sian; Wilkinson, Lawrence S.; Isles, Anthony R.] Cardiff Univ, Sch Med, Neurosci & Mental Hlth Res Inst, MRC,Ctr Neuropsychiat Genet & Genom,Behav Genet G, Cardiff CF14 4XN, S Glam, Wales; [Garfield, Alastair S.; Gilroy, Kerry; Baker, Sian; Wilkinson, Lawrence S.; Isles, Anthony R.] Cardiff Univ, Sch Psychol, Neurosci & Mental Hlth Res Inst, MRC,Ctr Neuropsychiat Genet & Genom,Behav Genet G, Cardiff CF14 4XN, S Glam, Wales; [Xia, Jing; Dalley, Jeffrey W.] Univ Cambridge, Behav & Clin Neurosci Inst, Cambridge CB2 3EB, England; [Xia, Jing; Dalley, Jeffrey W.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Expt Psychol, Cambridge CB2 3EB, England; [Dalley, Jeffrey W.] Univ Cambridge, Addenbrookes Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Cambridge CB2 2QQ, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09651,Article,,bssaw@bath.ac.uk,U101,Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council; Medical Research Council; Wellcome Trust,"We thank S.

66,12,371.0,"The magnitude-8.8 Maule (Chile) earthquake of 27 February 2010 ruptured a segment of the Andean subduction zone megathrust that has been suspected to be of high seismic potential(1-6). It is the largest earthquake to rupture a mature seismic gap in a subduction zone that has been monitored with a dense space-geodetic network before the event. This provides an image of the pre-seismically locked state of the plate interface of unprecedentedly high resolution, allowing for an assessment of the spatial correlation of interseismic locking with coseismic slip. Pre-seismic locking might be used to anticipate future ruptures in many seismic gaps(6-12), given the fundamental assumption that locking and slip are similar. This hypothesis, however, could not be tested without the occurrence of the first gap-filling earthquake. Here we show evidence that the 2010 Maule earthquake slip distribution correlates closely with the patchwork of interseismic locking distribution as derived by inversion of global positioning system (GPS) observations during the previous decade. The earthquake nucleated in a region of high locking gradient and released most of the stresses accumulated in the area since the last major event in 1835. Two regions of high seismic slip (asperities) appeared to be nearly fully locked before the earthquake. Between these asperities, the rupture bridged a zone that was creeping interseismically with consistently low coseismic slip. The rupture stopped in areas that were highly locked before the earthquake but where pre-stress had been significantly reduced by overlapping twentieth-century earthquakes. Our work suggests that coseismic slip heterogeneity at the scale of single asperities should indicate the seismic potential of future great earthquakes, which thus might be anticipated by geodetic observations.","Moreno, Marcos; Rosenau, Matthias; Oncken, Onno","Moreno, M; Rosenau, M; Oncken, O",198.0,"[Moreno, Marcos; Rosenau, Matthias; Oncken, Onno] GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, Helmholtz Ctr Potsdam, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09349,Article,1476-4687,oncken@gfz-potsdam.de,U84,,,647KB,Y,N,OFQUI FAULT ZONE; SOUTHERN ANDES; STRAIN ACCUMULATION; CENTRAL CHILE; DEFORMATION; MODEL; GAPS; PACIFIC; AMERICA; RUPTURE,7312.0,NATURE,Nature,English,55.0,No,"Moreno, Marcos/0000-0002-6023-7283; Rosenau, Matthias/0000-0003-1134-5381","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",9-Sep,7.0,LONDON,20829792.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2010.0,"GEOFON, GlobalSeismicNetwork/E-4273-2012; Moreno, Marcos/M-4632-2013; Rosenau, Matthias/I-2081-2016","Oncken, O (reprint author), GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, Helmholtz Ctr Potsdam, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,181.0,2010 Maule earthquake slip correlates with pre-seismic locking of Andean subduction zone,2.0,64.0,WOS:000281616300032,371.0,467,Multidisciplinary Sciences,185,onno,oncken,6625.0,7,male,1.0,lh7j4-wAAAAJ,3,"(4126, 9345]",6306834,1,na,0,Oncken,na,1,0
67,142,32.0,"Historically, the study of speech processing has emphasized a strong link between auditory perceptual input and motor production output(1-4). A kind of 'parity' is essential, as both perception-and production-based representations must form a unified interface to facilitate access to higher-order language processes such as syntax and semantics, believed to be computed in the dominant, typically left hemisphere(5,6). Although various theories have been proposed to unite perception and production(2,7), the underlying neural mechanisms are unclear. Early models of speech and language processing proposed that perceptual processing occurred in the left posterior superior temporal gyrus (Wernicke's area) and motor production processes occurred in the left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's area)(8,9). Sensory activity was proposed to link to production activity through connecting fibre tracts, forming the left lateralized speech sensory-motor system(10). Although recent evidence indicates that speech perception occurs bilaterally(11-13), prevailing models maintain that the speech sensory-motor system is left lateralized(11,14-18) and facilitates the transformation from sensory-based auditory representations to motor-based production representations(11,15,16). However, evidence for the lateralized computation of sensory-motor speech transformations is indirect and primarily comes from stroke patients that have speech repetition deficits (conduction aphasia) and studies using covert speech and haemodynamic functional imaging(16,19). Whether the speech sensory-motor system is lateralized, like higher-order language processes, or bilateral, like speech perception, is controversial. Here we use direct neural recordings in subjects performing sensory-motor tasks involving overt speech production to show that sensory-motor transformations occur bilaterally. We demonstrate that electrodes over bilateral inferior frontal, inferior parietal, superior temporal, premotor and somatosensory cortices exhibit robust sensory-motor neural responses during both perception and production in an overt word-repetition task. Using a non-word transformation task, we show that bilateral sensory-motor responses can perform transformations between speech-perception-and speech-production-based representations. These results establish a bilateral sublexical speech sensory-motor system.","Cogan, Gregory B.; Thesen, Thomas; Carlson, Chad; Doyle, Werner; Devinsky, Orrin; Pesaran, Bijan","Cogan, GB; Thesen, T; Carlson, C; Doyle, W; Devinsky, O; Pesaran, B",94.0,"[Cogan, Gregory B.; Pesaran, Bijan] NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Thesen, Thomas; Carlson, Chad; Devinsky, Orrin] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Doyle, Werner; Devinsky, Orrin] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Neurosurg, New York, NY 10016 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12935,Article,1476-4687,bijan@nyu.edu,+,NIDCD [R03-DC010475]; Burroughs Wellcome Fund; NYSTAR; McKnight Scholar Award; Sloan Research Fellowship,"We would like to thank A.

68,85,331.0,"Protein folding is an inherently complex process involving coordination of the intricate networks of weak interactions that stabilize native three-dimensional structures. In the conventional paradigm, simple protein structures are assumed to fold in an all-or-none process(1) that is inaccessible to experiment. Existing experimental methods therefore probe folding mechanisms indirectly. A widely used approach interprets changes in protein stability(2) and/or folding kinetics(3,4), induced by engineered mutations, in terms of the structure of the native protein. In addition to limitations in connecting energetics with structure(5), mutational methods have significant experimental uncertainties(6) and are unable to map complex networks of interactions. In contrast, analytical theory predicts small barriers to folding and the possibility of downhill folding(7,8). These theoretical predictions have been confirmed experimentally in recent years(9-11), including the observation of global downhill folding(12). However, a key remaining question is whether downhill folding can indeed lead to the high-resolution analysis of protein folding processes(13). Here we show, with the use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), that the downhill protein BBL from Escherichia coli unfolds atom by atom starting from a defined three-dimensional structure. Thermal unfolding data on 158 backbone and side-chain protons out of a total of 204 provide a detailed view of the structural events during folding. This view confirms the statistical nature of folding, and exposes the interplay between hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic forces, backbone conformation and side-chain entropy. From the data we also obtain a map of the interaction network in this protein, which reveals the source of folding cooperativity. Our approach can be extended to other proteins with marginal barriers ( less than 3RT), providing a new tool for the study of protein folding.","Sadqi, Mourad; Fushman, David; Munoz, Victor","Sadqi, M; Fushman, D; Munoz, V",317.0,"Univ Maryland, Dept Chem & Biochem, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; Univ Maryland, Ctr Biomol Struct & Org, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature04859,Article,,vmunoz@umd.edu,321,,,064WT,,,CHEMICAL-SHIFTS; SPEED LIMIT; 2-STATE; MODEL; STABILITY; DOMAIN,7100.0,NATURE,Nature,English,29.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",20-Jul,5.0,LONDON,16799571.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,,"Munoz, V (reprint author), Univ Maryland, Dept Chem & Biochem, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,177.0,Atom-by-atom analysis of global downhill protein folding,1.0,27.0,WOS:000239122100042,331.0,442,Multidisciplinary Sciences,177,victor,munoz,8882.0,2234,male,1.0,5LLRxnsAAAAJ,3,"(4126, 9345]",7356774,1,31505624,1,Víctor Muñoz,Víctor Muñoz,0,0
69,119,11.0,"The most important energy development of the past decade has been the wide deployment of hydraulic fracturing technologies that enable the production of previously uneconomic shale gas resources in North America(1). If these advanced gas production technologies were to be deployed globally, the energy market could see a large influx of economically competitive unconventional gas resources(2). The climate implications of such abundant natural gas have been hotly debated. Some researchers have observed that abundant natural gas substituting for coal could reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions(3-6). Others have reported that the non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions associated with shale gas production make its lifecycle emissions higher than those of coal(7,8). Assessment of the full impact of abundant gas on climate change requires an integrated approach to the global energyeconomyclimate systems, but the literature has been limited in either its geographic scope(9,10) or its coverage of greenhouse gases(2). Here we show that market-driven increases in global supplies of unconventional natural gas do not discernibly reduce the trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions or climate forcing. Our results, based on simulations from five state-of-the-art integrated assessment models(11) of energyeconomyclimate systems independently forced by an abundant gas scenario, project large additional natural gas consumption of up to +170 per cent by 2050. The impact on CO2 emissions, however, is found to be much smaller (from -2 per cent to +11 per cent), and a majority of the models reported a small increase in climate forcing (from -0.3 per cent to +7 per cent) associated with the increased use of abundant gas. Our results show that although market penetration of globally abundant gas may substantially change the future energy system, it is not necessarily an effective substitute for climate change mitigation policy(9,10).","McJeon, Haewon; Edmonds, Jae; Bauer, Nico; Clarke, Leon; Fisher, Brian; Flannery, Brian P.; Hilaire, Jerome; Krey, Volker; Marangoni, Giacomo; Mi, Raymond; Riahi, Keywan; Rogner, Holger; Tavoni, Massimo","McJeon, H; Edmonds, J; Bauer, N; Clarke, L; Fisher, B; Flannery, BP; Hilaire, J; Krey, V; Marangoni, G; Mi, R; Riahi, K; Rogner, H; Tavoni, M",482.0,"[McJeon, Haewon; Edmonds, Jae; Clarke, Leon] Pacific NW Natl Lab, JGCRI, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Bauer, Nico; Hilaire, Jerome] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Fisher, Brian; Mi, Raymond] BAEconomics, Kingston, ACT 2604, Australia; [Flannery, Brian P.] Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Krey, Volker; Riahi, Keywan; Rogner, Holger] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Marangoni, Giacomo; Tavoni, Massimo] Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, I-20156 Milan, Italy; [Marangoni, Giacomo; Tavoni, Massimo] Politecn Milan, I-20156 Milan, Italy",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13837,Article,1476-4687,haewon.mcjeon@pnnl.gov,+,"BAEconomics; Global Technology Strategy Project; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research; Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research; Italian Ministry of Environment, Land and Sea under the GEMINA project","B.F. and R.M. and their development of BAEGEM were supported by BAEconomics with assistance for special applications to the resource sector from Rio Tinto (Australia).

70,117,460.0,"Mutations or amplification of the MET proto-oncogene are involved in the pathogenesis of several tumours(1-4), which rely on the constitutive engagement of this pathway for their growth and survival(1,5). However, MET is expressed not only by cancer cells but also by tumour-associated stromal cells, although its precise role in this compartment is not well characterized(6-11). Here we show that MET is required for neutrophil chemoattraction and cytotoxicity in response to its ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Met deletion in mouse neutrophils enhances tumour growth and metastasis. This phenotype correlates with reduced neutrophil infiltration to both the primary tumour and metastatic sites. Similarly, Met is necessary for neutrophil transudation during colitis, skin rash or peritonitis. Mechanistically, Met is induced by tumour-derived tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha or other inflammatory stimuli in both mouse and human neutrophils. This induction is instrumental for neutrophil transmigration across an activated endothelium and for inducible nitric oxide synthase production upon HGF stimulation. Consequently, HGF/MET-dependent nitric oxide release by neutrophils promotes cancer cell killing, which abates tumour growth and metastasis. After systemic administration of a MET kinase inhibitor, we prove that the therapeutic benefit of MET targeting in cancer cells is partly countered by the pro-tumoural effect arising from MET blockade in neutrophils. Our work identifies an unprecedented role of MET in neutrophils, suggests a potential 'Achilles' heel' of MET-targeted therapies in cancer, and supports the rationale for evaluating anti-MET drugs in certain inflammatory diseases.","Finisguerra, Veronica; Di Conza, Giusy; Di Matteo, Mario; Serneels, Jens; Costa, Sandra; Thompson, A.

71,96,156.0,"Neuroblastoma is a malignant paediatric tumour of the sympathetic nervous system(1). Roughly half of these tumours regress spontaneously or are cured by limited therapy. By contrast, high-risk neuroblastomas have an unfavourable clinical course despite intensive multimodal treatment, and their molecular basis has remained largely elusive(2-4). Here we have performed whole-genome sequencing of 56 neuroblastomas (high-risk, n = 39; low-risk, n = 17) and discovered recurrent genomic rearrangements affecting a chromosomal region at 5p15.33 proximal of the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (TERT). These rearrangements occurred only in high-risk neuroblastomas (12/39, 31%) in a mutually exclusive fashion with MYCN amplifications and ATRX mutations, which are known genetic events in this tumour type(1,2,5). In an extended case series (n = 217), TERT rearrangements defined a subgroup of high-risk tumours with particularly poor outcome. Despite a large structural diversity of these rearrangements, they all induced massive transcriptional upregulation of TERT. In the remaining high-risk tumours, TERT expression was also elevated in MYCN-amplified tumours, whereas alternative lengthening of telomeres was present in neuroblastomas without TERT or MYCN alterations, suggesting that telomere lengthening represents a central mechanism defining this subtype. The 5p15.33 rearrangements juxtapose the TERT coding sequence to strong enhancer elements, resulting in massive chromatin remodelling and DNA methylation of the affected region. Supporting a functional role of TERT, neuroblastoma cell lines bearing rearrangements or amplified MYCN exhibited both upregulated TERT expression and enzymatic telomerase activity. In summary, our findings show that remodelling of the genomic context abrogates transcriptional silencing of TERT in high-risk neuroblastoma and places telomerase activation in the centre of transformation in a large fraction of these tumours.","Peifer, Martin;

72,103,278.0,"Metamaterials, man-made composite media structured on a scale much smaller than a wavelength, offer surprising possibilities for engineering the propagation of waves(1-6). One of the most interesting of these is the ability to achieve superlensing-that is, to focus or image beyond the diffraction limit(7). This originates from the left-handed behaviour-the property of refracting waves negatively-that is typical of negative index metamaterials(8-10). Yet reaching this goal requires the design of 'double negative' metamaterials, which act simultaneously on the permittivity and permeability in electromagnetics(11,12), or on the density and compressibility in acoustics; this generally implies the use of two different kinds of building blocks(13,14) or specific particles presenting multiple overlapping resonances(15-17). Such a requirement limits the applicability of double negative metamaterials, and has, for example, hampered any demonstration of subwavelength focusing using left-handed acoustic metamaterials(18). Here we show that these strict conditions can be largely relaxed by relying on media that consist of only one type of single resonant unit cell. Specifically, we show with a simple yet general semi-analytical model that judiciously breaking the symmetry of a single negative metamaterial is sufficient to turn it into a double negative one. We then demonstrate that this occurs solely because of multiple scattering of waves off the metamaterial resonant elements, a phenomenon often disregarded in these media owing to their subwavelength patterning. We apply our approach to acoustics and verify through numerical simulations that it allows the realization of negative index acoustic metamaterials based on Helmholtz resonators only. Finally, we demonstrate the operation of a negative index acoustic superlens, achieving subwavelength focusing and imaging with spot width and resolution 7 and 3.5 times better than the diffraction limit, respectively. Our findings have profound implications for the physics of metamaterials, highlighting the role of their subwavelength crystalline structure, and hence entering the realm of metamaterial crystals. This widens the scope of possibilities for designing composite media with novel properties in a much simpler way than has been possible so far.","Kaina, Nadege; Lemoult, Fabrice; Fink, Mathias; Lerosey, Geoffroy","Kaina, N; Lemoult, F; Fink, M; Lerosey, G",77.0,"[Kaina, Nadege; Lemoult, Fabrice; Fink, Mathias; Lerosey, Geoffroy] ESPCI ParisTech, Inst Langevin, F-75005 Paris, France; [Kaina, Nadege; Lemoult, Fabrice; Fink, Mathias; Lerosey, Geoffroy] CNRS, UMR 7587, F-75005 Paris, France",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14678,Article,1476-4687,geoffroy.lerosey@espci.fr,+,"LABEX WIFI (Laboratory of Excellence within the French Program ""Investments for the Future"") [ANR-10-LABX-24, ANR-10-IDEX-0001-02 PSL*]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-13-JS09-0001-01]; French ""Direction Generale de l'Armement""","We thank A.

The main-sequence turn-off age (similar to 8 Gyr) and the age derived from the termination of the white dwarf cooling sequence (similar to 6 Gyr) are very different. One possible explanation is that as white dwarfs cool, one of the ashes of helium burning, (22)Ne, sinks in the deep interior of these stars(3-5). At lower temperatures, white dwarfs are expected to crystallize and phase separation of the main constituents of the core of a typical white dwarf ((12)C and (16)O) is expected to occur(6,7). This sequence of events is expected to introduce long delays in the cooling times(8,9), but has not hitherto been proven.

74,48,101.0,"Graphite vaporization provides an uncontrolled yet efficient means of producing fullerene molecules. However, some fullerene derivatives or unusual fullerene species might only be accessible through rational and controlled synthesis methods. Recently, such an approach has been used(1) to produce isolable amounts of the fullerene C(60) from commercially available starting materials. But the overall process required 11 steps to generate a suitable polycyclic aromatic precursor molecule, which was then dehydrogenated in the gas phase with a yield of only about one per cent. Here we report the formation of C(60) and the triazafullerene C(57)N(3) from aromatic precursors using a highly efficient surface-catalysed cyclodehydrogenation process. We find that after deposition onto a platinum (111) surface and heating to 750 K, the precursors are transformed into the corresponding fullerene and triazafullerene molecules with about 100 per cent yield. We expect that this approach will allow the production of a range of other fullerenes and heterofullerenes(2,3), once suitable precursors are available. Also, if the process is carried out in an atmosphere containing guest species, it might even allow the encapsulation of atoms or small molecules to form endohedral fullerenes(4,5).","Otero, Gonzalo; Biddau, Giulio; Sanchez-Sanchez, Carlos; Caillard, Renaud; Lopez, Maria F.; Rogero, Celia; Palomares, F.

75,196,390.0,"Fertilization of the ocean by adding iron compounds has induced diatom-dominated phytoplankton blooms accompanied by considerable carbon dioxide drawdown in the ocean surface layer. However, because the fate of bloom biomass could not be adequately resolved in these experiments, the timescales of carbon sequestration from the atmosphere are uncertain. Here we report the results of a five-week experiment carried out in the closed core of a vertically coherent, mesoscale eddy of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, during which we tracked sinking particles from the surface to the deep-sea floor. A large diatom bloom peaked in the fourth week after fertilization. This was followed by mass mortality of several diatom species that formed rapidly sinking, mucilaginous aggregates of entangled cells and chains. Taken together, multiple lines of evidence-although each with important uncertainties-lead us to conclude that at least half the bloom biomass sank far below a depth of 1,000 metres and that a substantial portion is likely to have reached the sea floor. Thus, iron-fertilized diatom blooms may sequester carbon for timescales of centuries in ocean bottom water and for longer in the sediments.","Smetacek, Victor; Klaas, Christine; Strass, Volker H.; Assmy, Philipp; Montresor, Marina; Cisewski, Boris; Savoye, Nicolas; Webb, Adrian; d'Ovidio, Francesco; Arrieta, Jesus M.; Bathmann, Ulrich; Bellerby, Richard; Berg, Gry Mine; Croot, Peter; Gonzalez, Santiago; Henjes, Joachim; Herndl, Gerhard J.; Hoffmann, Linn J.; Leach, Harry; Losch, Martin; Mills, Matthew M.; Neill, Craig; Peeken, Ilka; Roettgers, Ruediger; Sachs, Oliver; Sauter, Eberhard; Schmidt, Maike M.; Schwarz, Jill; Terbrueggen, Anja; Wolf-Gladrow, Dieter","Smetacek, V; Klaas, C; Strass, VH; Assmy, P; Montresor, M; Cisewski, B; Savoye, N; Webb, A; d'Ovidio, F; Arrieta, JM; Bathmann, U; Bellerby, R; Berg, GM; Croot, P; Gonzalez, S; Henjes, J; Herndl, GJ; Hoffmann, LJ; Leach, H; Losch, M; Mills, MM; Neill, C; Peeken, I; Rottgers, R; Sachs, O; Sauter, E; Schmidt, MM; Schwarz, J; Terbruggen, A; Wolf-Gladrow, D",313.0,"[Smetacek, Victor; Klaas, Christine; Strass, Volker H.; Assmy, Philipp; Cisewski, Boris; Bathmann, Ulrich; Henjes, Joachim; Losch, Martin; Peeken, Ilka; Sachs, Oliver; Sauter, Eberhard; Schwarz, Jill; Terbrueggen, Anja; Wolf-Gladrow, Dieter] Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, D-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany; [Smetacek, Victor] Natl Inst Oceanog, Panaji 403004, Goa, India; [Assmy, Philipp] Norwegian Polar Res Inst, Fram Ctr, N-9296 Tromso, Norway; [Montresor, Marina] Stn Zool Anton Dohrn, I-80121 Naples, Italy; [Cisewski, Boris] Johann Heinrich von Thunen Inst, Inst Sea Fisheries, D-22767 Hamburg, Germany; [Savoye, Nicolas] Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Analyt & Environm Chem, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Savoye, Nicolas] Univ Bordeaux, CNRS, EPOC, UMR 5805,Stn Marine Arcachon, F-33120 Arcachon, France; [Webb, Adrian] Univ Cape Town, Dept Oceanog, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa; [d'Ovidio, Francesco] CNRS UPMC IRD MNHN, LOCEAN IPSL, F-75252 Paris, France; [Arrieta, Jesus M.; Gonzalez, Santiago; Herndl, Gerhard J.] Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, Dept Biol Oceanog, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Netherlands; [Arrieta, Jesus M.] CSIC UIB, Inst Mediterraneo Estudios Avanzados, Dept Global Change Res, Esporles 07190, Mallorca, Spain; [Bathmann, Ulrich] Leibniz Inst Balt Sea Res Warnemunde, D-18119 Rostock, Germany; [Bellerby, Richard; Neill, Craig] Univ Bergen, Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, N-5007 Bergen, Norway; [Bellerby, Richard] Norwegian Inst Water Res, N-5006 Bergen, Norway; [Berg, Gry Mine; Mills, Matthew M.] Stanford Univ, Dept Environm Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Croot, Peter; Hoffmann, Linn J.] Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Croot, Peter] Natl Univ Ireland, Sch Nat Sci, Galway, Ireland; [Henjes, Joachim] Phytolut GmbH, D-28759 Bremen, Germany; [Herndl, Gerhard J.] Univ Vienna, Dept Marine Biol, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Leach, Harry] Univ Liverpool, Sch Environm Sci, Liverpool L69 3GP, Merseyside, England; [Neill, Craig] Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org, Wealth Oceans Flagship, Hobart, Tas 7000, Australia; [Peeken, Ilka] Univ Bremen, MARUM Ctr Marine Environm Sci, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Roettgers, Ruediger] Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Ctr Mat & Coastal Res, Inst Coastal Res, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany; [Sachs, Oliver] Eberhard & Partner AG, CH-5000 Aarau, Switzerland; [Schmidt, Maike M.] Univ Bremen, Ctr Biomol Interact Bremen, FB 2, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Schwarz, Jill] Univ Plymouth, Sch Marine Sci & Engn, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11229,Article,,victor.smetacek@awi.de; christine.klaas@awi.de,319,Cnes,"We thank C.

77,168,150.0,"Understanding the growth rate of the continental crust through timeis a fundamental issue inEarth sciences(1-8). The isotopic signatures of noble gases in the silicate Earth (mantle, crust) and in the atmosphere afford exceptional insight into the evolution through time of these geochemical reservoirs(9). However, no data for the compositions of these reservoirs exists for the distant past, and temporal exchange rates between Earth's interior and its surface are severely under-constrained owing to a lack of samples preserving the original signature of the atmosphere at the time of their formation. Here, we report the analysis of argon in Archaean (3.5-billion-year-old) hydrothermal quartz. Noble gases are hosted in primary fluid inclusions containing a mixture of Archaean freshwater and hydrothermal fluid. Our analysis reveals Archaean atmospheric argon with a Ar-40/Ar-36 value of 143 +/- 24, lower than the present-day value of 298.6 (for which Ar-40 has been produced by the radioactive decay of the potassium isotope K-40, with a half-life of 1.25 billion years; Ar-36 is primordial in origin).

78,86,19.0,"Tandem repeat proteins, which are formed by repetition of modular units of protein sequence and structure, play important biological roles as macromolecular binding and scaffolding domains, enzymes, and building blocks for the assembly of fibrous materials(1,2). The modular nature of repeat proteins enables the rapid construction and diversification of extended binding surfaces by duplication and recombination of simple building blocks(3,4). The overall architecture of tandem repeat protein structures-which is dictated by the internal geometry and local packing of the repeat building blocks-is highly diverse, ranging from extended, super-helical folds that bind peptide, DNA, and RNA partners(5-9), to closed and compact conformations with internal cavities suitable for small molecule binding and catalysis(10). Here we report the development and validation of computational methods for de novo design of tandem repeat protein architectures driven purely by geometric criteria defining the inter-repeat geometry, without reference to the sequences and structures of existing repeat protein families. We have applied these methods to design a series of closed alpha-solenoid(11) repeat structures (alpha-toroids) in which the inter-repeat packing geometry is constrained so as to juxtapose the amino (N) and carboxy (C) termini; several of these designed structures have been validated by X-ray crystallography. Unlike previous approaches to tandem repeat protein engineering(12-20), our design procedure does not rely on template sequence or structural information taken from natural repeat proteins and hence can produce structures unlike those seen in nature. As an example, we have successfully designed and validated closed alpha-solenoid repeats with a left-handed helical architecture that-to our knowledge-is not yet present in the protein structure database(21).","Doyle, Lindsey; Hallinan, Jazmine; Bolduc, Jill; Parmeggiani, Fabio; Baker, David; Stoddard, Barry L.; Bradley, Philip","Doyle, L; Hallinan, J; Bolduc, J; Parmeggiani, F; Baker, D; Stoddard, BL; Bradley, P",585.0,"[Doyle, Lindsey; Hallinan, Jazmine; Bolduc, Jill; Stoddard, Barry L.; Bradley, Philip] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Div Basic Sci, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Parmeggiani, Fabio; Baker, David] Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Parmeggiani, Fabio; Baker, David; Bradley, Philip] Univ Washington, Inst Prot Design, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Baker, David] Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Bradley, Philip] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Div Publ Hlth Sci, Seattle, WA 98019 USA",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature16191,Article,1476-4687,pbradley@fredhutch.org,+,"National Institutes of Health [R21GM106117, R01GM49857]; Swiss National Science Foundation Postdoc Fellowship [PBZHP3-125470]; Human Frontier Science Program Long-Term Fellowship [LT000070/2009-L]","The authors thank Scientific Computing at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center for providing the computational infrastructure necessary for this project.

79,163,9.0,"DNA methylation is a heritable epigenetic modification involved in gene silencing, imprinting, and the suppression of retrotransposons(1). Global DNA demethylation occurs in the early embryo and the germ line(2,3), and may be mediated by Tet (ten eleven translocation) enzymes(4-6), which convert 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC)(7). Tet enzymes have been studied extensively in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells(8-12), which are generally cultured in the absence of vitamin C, a potential cofactor for Fe(II) 2-oxoglutarate dioxygenase enzymes such as Tet enzymes. Here we report that addition of vitamin C to mouse ES cells promotes Tet activity, leading to a rapid and global increase in 5hmC. This is followed by DNA demethylation of many gene promoters and upregulation of demethylated germline genes. Tet1 binding is enriched near the transcription start site of genes affected by vitamin C treatment. Importantly, vitamin C, but not other antioxidants, enhances the activity of recombinant Tet1 in a biochemical assay, and the vitamin-C-induced changes in 5hmC and 5mC are entirely suppressed in Tet1 and Tet2 double knockout ES cells. Vitamin C has a stronger effect on regions that gain methylation in cultured ES cells compared to blastocysts, and in vivo are methylated only after implantation. In contrast, imprinted regions and intracisternal A particle retroelements, which are resistant to demethylation in the early embryo(2,13), are resistant to vitamin-C-induced DNA demethylation. Collectively, the results of this study establish vitamin C as a direct regulator of Tet activity and DNA methylation fidelity in ES cells.","Blaschke, Kathryn; Ebata, Kevin T.; Karimi, Mohammad M.; Zepeda-Martinez, Jorge A.; Goyal, Preeti; Mahapatra, Sahasransu; Tam, Angela; Laird, Diana J.; Hirst, Martin; Rao, Anjana; Lorincz, Matthew C.; Ramalho-Santos, Miguel","Blaschke, K; Ebata, KT; Karimi, MM; Zepeda-Martinez, JA; Goyal, P; Mahapatra, S; Tam, A; Laird, DJ; Hirst, M; Rao, A; Lorincz, MC; Ramalho-Santos, M",222.0,"[Blaschke, Kathryn; Ebata, Kevin T.; Laird, Diana J.; Ramalho-Santos, Miguel] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Eli & Edythe Broad Ctr Regenerat Med & Stem Cell, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Blaschke, Kathryn; Ebata, Kevin T.; Laird, Diana J.; Ramalho-Santos, Miguel] Univ Calif San Francisco, Ctr Reprod Sci, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Karimi, Mohammad M.; Goyal, Preeti; Lorincz, Matthew C.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Med Genet, Inst Life Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada; [Karimi, Mohammad M.; Tam, Angela; Hirst, Martin] British Columbia Canc Agcy, Canadas Michael Smith Genome Sci Ctr, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada; [Zepeda-Martinez, Jorge A.; Mahapatra, Sahasransu; Rao, Anjana] La Jolla Inst Allergy & Immunol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Zepeda-Martinez, Jorge A.; Mahapatra, Sahasransu; Rao, Anjana] Sanford Consortium Regenerat Med, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Hirst, Martin] Univ British Columbia, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Inst Life Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12362,Article,,mlorincz@mail.ubc.ca; mrsantos@diabetes.ucsf.edu,+,"NSF; California Institute of Regenerative Medicine postdoctoral training grant [TG2-01153]; Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research; CIHR [92093]; NIH [HD065812, CA151535, DP2OD004698, OD012204]; California Institute of Regenerative Medicine","The authors wish to acknowledge the epigenomics and sequencing groups at the Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre, Canada, for performing 5mC DIP and 5hmC DIP Illumina sequencing, as well as for technical support.

80,10,282.0,"Reconstructing the early evolutionary history of anthropoid primates is hindered by a lack of consensus on both the timing and biogeography of anthropoid origins(1-3). Some prefer an ancient (Cretaceous) origin for anthropoids in Africa or some other Gondwanan landmass(4), whereas others advocate a more recent (early Cenozoic) origin for anthropoids in Asia(1,2,5), with subsequent dispersal of one or more early anthropoid taxa to Africa. The oldest undoubted African anthropoid primates described so far are three species of the parapithecid Biretia from the late middle Eocene Bir El Ater locality of Algeria(6) and the late Eocene BQ-2 site in the Fayum region of northern Egypt(7). Here we report the discovery of the oldest known diverse assemblage of African anthropoids from the late middle Eocene Dur At-Talah escarpment in central Libya. The primate assemblage from Dur At-Talah includes diminutive species pertaining to three higher-level anthropoid clades (Afrotarsiidae, Parapithecidae and Oligopithecidae) as well as a small species of the early strepsirhine primate Karanisia. The high taxonomic diversity of anthropoids at Dur At-Talah indicates either a much longer interval of anthropoid evolution in Africa than is currently documented in the fossil record or the nearly synchronous colonization of Africa by multiple anthropoid clades at some time during the middle Eocene epoch.","Jaeger, Jean-Jacques; Beard, K.

81,111,399.0,"One of the characteristics of the central nervous system is the lack of a classical lymphatic drainage system. Although it is now accepted that the central nervous system undergoes constant immune surveillance that takes place within the meningeal compartment(1-3), the mechanisms governing the entrance and exit of immune cells from the central nervous system remain poorly understood(4-6). In searching for T-cell gateways into and out of the meninges, we discovered functional lymphatic vessels lining the dural sinuses. These structures express all of the molecular hallmarks of lymphatic endothelial cells, are able to carry both fluid and immune cells from the cerebrospinal fluid, and are connected to the deep cervical lymph nodes. The unique location of these vessels may have impeded their discovery to date, thereby contributing to the long-held concept of the absence of lymphatic vasculature in the central nervous system. The discovery of the central nervous system lymphatic system may call for a reassessment of basic assumptions in neuroimmunology and sheds new light on the aetiology of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases associated with immune system dysfunction.","Louveau, Antoine; Smirnov, Igor; Keyes, Timothy J.; Eccles, Jacob D.; Rouhani, Sherin J.; Peske, J.

82,7,168.0,"Covalent modification of histones is fundamental in orchestrating chromatin dynamics and transcription(1-3). One example of such an epigenetic mark is the mono-ubiquitination of histones, which mainly occurs at histone H2A and H2B(4-6). Ubiquitination of histone H2A has been implicated in polycomb-mediated transcriptional silencing(7-9). However, the precise role of the ubiquitin mark during silencing is still elusive. Here we show in human cell lines that ZRF1 (zuotin-related factor 1) is specifically recruited to histone H2A when it is ubiquitinated at Lys 119 by means of a novel ubiquitin-interacting domain that is located in the evolutionarily conserved zuotin domain. At the onset of differentiation, ZRF1 specifically displaces polycomb-repressive complex 1 (PRC1) from chromatin and facilitates transcriptional activation. A genome-wide mapping of ZRF1, RING1B and H2A-ubiquitin targets revealed its involvement in the regulation of a large set of polycomb target genes, emphasizing the key role ZRF1 has in cell fate decisions. We provide here a model of the molecular mechanism of switching polycomb-repressed genes to an active state.","Richly, Holger; Rocha-Viegas, Luciana; Domingues Ribeiro, Joana; Demajo, Santiago; Gundem, Gunes; Lopez-Bigas, Nuria; Nakagawa, Tekeya; Rospert, Sabine; Ito, Takashi; Di Croce, Luciano","Richly, H; Rocha-Viegas, L; Ribeiro, JD; Demajo, S; Gundem, G; Lopez-Bigas, N; Nakagawa, T; Rospert, S; Ito, T; Di Croce, L",1124.0,"[Richly, Holger; Rocha-Viegas, Luciana; Domingues Ribeiro, Joana; Demajo, Santiago; Di Croce, Luciano] UPF, CRG, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Gundem, Gunes; Lopez-Bigas, Nuria] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Expt & Hlth Sci, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Nakagawa, Tekeya; Ito, Takashi] Nagasaki Univ, Sch Med, Nagasaki 8528523, Japan; [Rospert, Sabine] Univ Freiburg, Inst Biochem & Mol Biol ZBMZ, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Di Croce, Luciano] PRBB, CRG, ICREA, Barcelona 08003, Spain",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09574,Article,,luciano.dicroce@crg.es,U533,"Spanish ""Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia'' [BFU2007-63059]; Association for International Cancer Research [10-0177]; AGAUR; Consolider; FEBS fellowship; Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia; Juan de la Cierva Fellowship; PFIS fellowship;  [FOR967]; ICREA","We are indebted to S.

83,105,304.0,"Cell-cell intercalation is used in several developmental processes to shape the normal body plan(1). There is no clear evidence that intercalation is involved in pathologies. Here we use the proto-oncogene myc to study a process analogous to early phase of tumour expansion: myc-induced cell competition(2-7). Cell competition is a conserved mechanism(5,6,8,9) driving the elimination of slow-proliferating cells (so-called 'losers') by faster-proliferating neighbours (so-called 'winners') through apoptosis(10) and is important in preventing developmental malformations and maintain tissue fitness(11). Here we show, using long-term live imaging of myc-driven competition in the Drosophila pupal notum and in the wing imaginal disc, that the probability of elimination of loser cells correlates with the surface of contact shared with winners. As such, modifying loser-winner interface morphology can modulate the strength of competition. We further show that elimination of loser clones requires winner-loser cell mixing through cell-cell intercalation. Cell mixing is driven by differential growth and the high tension at winner-winner interfaces relative to winner-loser and loser-loser interfaces, which leads to a preferential stabilization of winner-loser contacts and reduction of clone compactness over time.

84,151,252.0,"After fertilization, maternal factors direct development and trigger zygotic genome activation (ZGA) at the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). In zebrafish, ZGA is required for gastrulation and clearance of maternal messenger RNAs, which is in part regulated by the conserved microRNA miR-430. However, the factors that activate the zygotic program in vertebrates are unknown. Here we show that Nanog, Pou5f1 (also called Oct4) and SoxB1 regulate zygotic gene activation in zebrafish. We identified several hundred genes directly activated by maternal factors, constituting the first wave of zygotic transcription. Ribosome profiling revealed that nanog, sox19b and pou5f1 are the most highly translated transcription factors pre-MZT. Combined loss of these factors resulted in developmental arrest before gastrulation and a failure to activate >75% of zygotic genes, including miR-430. Our results demonstrate that maternal Nanog, Pou5f1 and SoxB1 are required to initiate the zygotic developmental program and induce clearance of the maternal program by activating miR-430 expression.","Lee, Miler T.; Bonneau, Ashley R.; Takacs, Carter M.; Bazzini, Ariel A.; DiVito, Kate R.; Fleming, Elizabeth S.; Giraldez, Antonio J.","Lee, MT; Bonneau, AR; Takacs, CM; Bazzini, AA; DiVito, KR; Fleming, ES; Giraldez, AJ",360.0,"[Lee, Miler T.; Bonneau, Ashley R.; Takacs, Carter M.; Bazzini, Ariel A.; DiVito, Kate R.; Fleming, Elizabeth S.; Giraldez, Antonio J.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Giraldez, Antonio J.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Yale Stem Cell Ctr, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12632,Article,1476-4687,antonio.giraldez@yale.edu,+,"NIH [F32HD071697-02, T32GM007499, F32HD061194-03]; Pew Fellows Program in Biomedical Sciences; Pew Scholars Program in the Biomedical Sciences; Yale Scholars Program;  [R01GM081602-06];  [R01GM103789-01];  [R01HD074078-02]","We thank Y.

85,83,301.0,"Epithelial tissues maintain a robust architecture during development. This fundamental property relies on intercellular adhesion through the formation of adherens junctions containing E-cadherin molecules(1,2). Localization of E-cadherin is stabilized through a pathway involving the recruitment of actin filaments by E-cadherin(3-6). Here we identify an additional pathway that organizes actin filaments in the apical junctional region (AJR) where adherens junctions form in embryonic epithelia. This pathway is controlled by Bitesize (Btsz), a synaptotagmin-like protein(7,8) that is recruited in the AJR independently of E-cadherin and is required for epithelial stability in Drosophila embryos. On loss of btsz, E-cadherin is recruited normally to the AJR, but is not stabilized properly and actin filaments fail to form a stable continuous network. In the absence of E-cadherin, actin filaments are stable for a longer time than they are in btsz mutants. We identify two polarized cues that localize Btsz: phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate, to which Btsz binds; and Par-3. We show that Btsz binds to the Ezrin - Radixin - Moesin protein Moesin, an F-actin-binding protein that is localized apically(9) and is recruited in the AJR in a btsz-dependent manner. Expression of a dominant-negative form of Ezrin that does not bind F-actin phenocopies the loss of btsz. Thus, our data indicate that, through their interaction, Btsz and Moesin may mediate the proper organization of actin in a local domain, which in turn stabilizes E-cadherin. These results provide a mechanism for the spatial order of actin organization underlying junction stabilization in primary embryonic epithelia.","Pilot, Fanny; Philippe, Jean-Marc; Lemmers, Celine; Lecuit, Thomas","Pilot, F; Philippe, JM; Lemmers, C; Lecuit, T",580.0,"Univ Mediterrannee, CNRS, UMR 6216, Inst Biol Dev Marseille Luminy, F-13288 Marseille 09, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature04935,Article,,lecuit@ibdm.univ-mrs.fr,584,,,069NQ,,,DROSOPHILA E-CADHERIN; EPITHELIAL-CELLS; POLARITY; MORPHOGENESIS; ARMADILLO; ADHESION; REARRANGEMENT; NEUROBLASTS; MECHANISMS; OOGENESIS,7102.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",3-Aug,5.0,LONDON,16862128.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,,"Lecuit, T (reprint author), Univ Mediterrannee, CNRS, UMR 6216, Inst Biol Dev Marseille Luminy, Campus Luminy,Case 907, F-13288 Marseille 09, France.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,84.0,Spatial control of actin organization at adherens junctions by the synaptotagmin-like protein Btsz,1.0,6.0,WOS:000239455900047,301.0,442,Multidisciplinary Sciences,85,thomas,lecuit,7459.0,3753,male,1.0,K4EMassAAAAJ,3,"(4126, 9345]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0

Alfven waves (travelling oscillations of ions and magnetic field) have been invoked as a possible mechanism to transport magneto-convective energy upwards along the Sun's magnetic field lines into the corona. Previous observations(7) of Alfvenic waves in the corona revealed amplitudes far too small (0.5 km s(-1)) to supply the energy flux (100-200 W m(-2)) required to drive the fast solar wind(8) or balance the radiative losses of the quiet corona(9).

87,9,220.0,"Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC)-the macroscopic ground-state accumulation of particles with integer spin (bosons) at low temperature and high density-has been observed in several physical systems(1-9), including cold atomic gases and solid-state quasiparticles. However, the most omnipresent Bose gas, blackbody radiation (radiation in thermal equilibrium with the cavity walls) does not show this phase transition. In such systems photons have a vanishing chemical potential, meaning that their number is not conserved when the temperature of the photon gas is varied(10); at low temperatures, photons disappear in the cavity walls instead of occupying the cavity ground state. Theoretical works have considered thermalization processes that conserve photon number (a prerequisite for BEC), involving Compton scattering with a gas of thermal electrons(11) or photon-photon scattering in a nonlinear resonator configuration(12,13). Number-conserving thermalization was experimentally observed(14) for a two-dimensional photon gas in a dye-filled optical microcavity, which acts as a 'white-wall' box. Here we report the observation of a Bose-Einstein condensate of photons in this system. The cavity mirrors provide both a confining potential and a nonvanishing effective photon mass, making the system formally equivalent to a two-dimensional gas of trapped, massive bosons. The photons thermalize to the temperature of the dye solution (room temperature) by multiple scattering with the dye molecules. Upon increasing the photon density, we observe the following BEC signatures: the photon energies have a Bose-Einstein distribution with a massively populated ground-state mode on top of a broad thermal wing; the phase transition occurs at the expected photon density and exhibits the predicted dependence on cavity geometry; and the ground-state mode emerges even for a spatially displaced pump spot. The prospects of the observed effects include studies of extremely weakly interacting low-dimensional Bose gases(9) and new coherent ultraviolet sources(15).","Klaers, Jan; Schmitt, Julian; Vewinger, Frank; Weitz, Martin","Klaers, J; Schmitt, J; Vewinger, F; Weitz, M",545.0,"[Klaers, Jan; Schmitt, Julian; Vewinger, Frank; Weitz, Martin] Univ Bonn, Inst Angew Phys, D-53115 Bonn, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09567,Article,,martin.weitz@uni-bonn.de,548,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft within the focused research unit [FOR557]; IFRAF at LKB Paris,"We thank J.

88,35,405.0,"Madagascar hosts one of the world's most unusual, endemic, diverse and threatened concentrations of fauna(1). To explain its unique, imbalanced biological diversity, G. G. Simpson proposed the 'sweepstakes hypothesis', according to which the ancestors of Madagascar's present-day mammal stock rafted there from Africa(2). This is an important hypothesis in biogeography and evolutionary theory for how animals colonize new frontiers(1,3-5), but its validity is questioned(5-9). Studies suggest that currents were inconsistent with rafting to Madagascar(9) and that land bridges provided the migrants' passage(5-8). Here we show that currents could have transported the animals to the island and highlight evidence inconsistent with the land-bridge hypothesis. Using palaeogeographic reconstructions and palaeo-oceanographic modelling, we find that strong surface currents flowed from northeast Mozambique and Tanzania eastward towards Madagascar during the Palaeogene period, exactly as required by the 'sweepstakes process'. Subsequently, Madagascar advanced north towards the equatorial gyre and the regional current system evolved into its modern configuration with flows westward(10) from Madagascar to Africa. This may explain why no fully non-aquatic land mammals have colonized Madagascar since the arrival of the rodents and carnivorans during the early-Miocene epoch. One implication is that rafting may be the dominant means of overseas dispersal in the Cenozoic era when palaeocurrent directions are properly considered.","Ali, Jason R.; Huber, Matthew","Ali, JR; Huber, M",653.0,"[Huber, Matthew] Purdue Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Huber, Matthew] Purdue Univ, Purdue Climate Change Res Ctr, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Ali, Jason R.] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Earth Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08706,Article,,huberm@purdue.edu,U80,US National Science Foundation (NSF) [0927946-ATM],"M.

89,173,276.0,"Topological insulators are a new phase of matter(1), with the striking property that conduction of electrons occurs only on their surfaces(1-3). In two dimensions, electrons on the surface of a topological insulator are not scattered despite defects and disorder, providing robustness akin to that of superconductors. Topological insulators are predicted to have wide-ranging applications in fault-tolerant quantum computing and spintronics. Substantial effort has been directed towards realizing topological insulators for electromagnetic waves(4-13). One-dimensional systems with topological edge states have been demonstrated, but these states are zero-dimensional and therefore exhibit no transport properties(11,12,14). Topological protection of microwaves has been observed using a mechanism similar to the quantum Hall effect(15), by placing a gyromagnetic photonic crystal in an external magnetic field(5). But because magnetic effects are very weak at optical frequencies, realizing photonic topological insulators with scatter-free edge states requires a fundamentally different mechanism-one that is free of magnetic fields. A number of proposals for photonic topological transport have been put forward recently(6-10). One suggested temporal modulation of a photonic crystal, thus breaking time-reversal symmetry and inducing one-way edge states(10). This is in the spirit of the proposed Floquet topological insulators(16-19), in which temporal variations in solid-state systems induce topological edge states. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate a photonic topological insulator free of external fields and with scatter-free edge transport-a photonic lattice exhibiting topologically protected transport of visible light on the lattice edges. Our system is composed of an array of evanescently coupled helical waveguides(20) arranged in a graphene-like honeycomblattice(21-26). Paraxial diffraction of light is described by a Schrodinger equation where the propagation coordinate (z) acts as 'time'(27). Thus the helicity of the waveguides breaks z-reversal symmetry as proposed for Floquet topological insulators. This structure results in one-way edge states that are topologically protected from scattering.","Rechtsman, Mikael C.; Zeuner, Julia M.; Plotnik, Yonatan; Lumer, Yaakov; Podolsky, Daniel; Dreisow, Felix; Nolte, Stefan; Segev, Mordechai; Szameit, Alexander","Rechtsman, MC; Zeuner, JM; Plotnik, Y; Lumer, Y; Podolsky, D; Dreisow, F; Nolte, S; Segev, M; Szameit, A",196.0,"[Rechtsman, Mikael C.; Plotnik, Yonatan; Lumer, Yaakov; Podolsky, Daniel; Segev, Mordechai] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Dept Phys, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel; [Rechtsman, Mikael C.; Plotnik, Yonatan; Lumer, Yaakov; Podolsky, Daniel; Segev, Mordechai] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Inst Solid State, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel; [Zeuner, Julia M.; Dreisow, Felix; Nolte, Stefan; Szameit, Alexander] Univ Jena, Abbe Ctr Photon, Inst Appl Phys, D-07743 Jena, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12066,Article,1476-4687,mcrworld@gmail.com; yonatanplotnik@gmail.com,200,"Azrieli Foundation; Israel Science Foundation; USA-Israel Binational Science Foundation; European Research Council; German Ministry of Education and Research (Center for Innovation Competence program) [03Z1HN31]; Thuringian Ministry for Education, Science and Culture (Research group Spacetime) [11027-514]","M.C.R. is grateful to the Azrieli Foundation for the Azrieli fellowship while at the Technion.

90,14,376.0,"In most eukaryotic cells, subsets of microtubules are adapted for specific functions by post-translational modifications (PTMs) of tubulin subunits. Acetylation of the epsilon-amino group of K40 on alpha-tubulin is a conserved PTM on the luminal side of microtubules(1) that was discovered in the flagella of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii(2,3). Studies on the significance of microtubule acetylation have been limited by the undefined status of the alpha-tubulin acetyltransferase. Here we show that MEC-17, a protein related to the Gcn5 histone acetyltransferases(4) and required for the function of touch receptor neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans(5,6), acts as a K40-specific acetyltransferase for alpha-tubulin. In vitro, MEC-17 exclusively acetylates K40 of alpha-tubulin. Disruption of the Tetrahymena MEC-17 gene phenocopies the K40R alpha-tubulin mutation and makes microtubules more labile. Depletion of MEC-17 in zebrafish produces phenotypes consistent with neuromuscular defects. In C. elegans, MEC-17 and its paralogue W06B11.1 are redundantly required for acetylation of MEC-12 alpha-tubulin, and contribute to the function of touch receptor neurons partly via MEC-12 acetylation and partly via another function, possibly by acetylating another protein. In summary, we identify MEC-17 as an enzyme that acetylates the K40 residue of alpha-tubulin, the only PTM known to occur on the luminal surface of microtubules.","Akella, Jyothi S.; Wloga, Dorota; Kim, Jihyun; Starostina, Natalia G.; Lyons-Abbott, Sally; Morrissette, Naomi S.; Dougan, Scott T.; Kipreos, Edward T.; Gaertig, Jacek","Akella, JS; Wloga, D; Kim, J; Starostina, NG; Lyons-Abbott, S; Morrissette, NS; Dougan, ST; Kipreos, ET; Gaertig, J",218.0,"[Akella, Jyothi S.; Wloga, Dorota; Kim, Jihyun; Starostina, Natalia G.; Dougan, Scott T.; Kipreos, Edward T.; Gaertig, Jacek] Univ Georgia, Dept Cellular Biol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Lyons-Abbott, Sally; Morrissette, Naomi S.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Mol Biol & Biochem, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09324,Article,1476-4687,jgaertig@cb.uga.edu,U111,"National Science Foundation [MBC-033965]; American Cancer Society [RSG DDC-112979]; National Institutes of Health [R01GM074212, R01AI067981, R01GM089912]","This work was supported by funds from the National Science Foundation (MBC-033965 to J.G.), American Cancer Society (RSG DDC-112979 to S.T.D.), and National Institutes of Health (R01GM074212 to E.

91,177,13.0,"Upon environmental changes or extracellular signals, cells are subjected to marked changes in gene expression (1,2). Dealing with high levels of transcription during replication is critical to prevent collisions between the transcription and replication pathways and avoid recombination events(3-5). In response to osmostress, hundreds of stress-responsive genes are rapidly induced by the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) Hog1 (ref.6), even during S phase(7). Here we show in Saccharomyces cerevisae that a single signalling molecule, Hog1, coordinates both replication and transcription upon osmostress. Hog1 interacts with and phosphorylates Mrc1, a component of the replication complex(8-11). Phosphorylation occurs at different sites to those targeted by Mec1 upon DNA damage(8,9). Mrc1 phosphorylation by Hog1 delays early and late origin firing by preventing Cdc45 loading, as well as slowing down replication-complex progression. Regulation of Mrc1 by Hog1 is completely independent of Mec1 and Rad53. Cells carrying a non-phosphorylatable allele of MRC1 (mrc1(3A)) do not delay replication upon stress and show a marked increase in transcription-associated recombination, genomic instability and Rad52 foci. In contrast, mrc1(3A) induces Rad53 and survival in the presence of hydroxyurea or methyl methanesulphonate. Therefore, Hog1 and Mrc1 define a novel S-phase checkpoint independent of the DNA-damage checkpoint that permits eukaryotic cells to prevent conflicts between DNA replication and transcription, which would otherwise lead to genomic instability when both phenomena are temporally coincident.","Duch, Alba; Felipe-Abrio, Irene; Barroso, Sonia; Yaakov, Gilad; Garcia-Rubio, Maria; Aguilera, Andres; de Nadal, Eulalia; Posas, Francesc","Duch, A; Felipe-Abrio, I; Barroso, S; Yaakov, G; Garcia-Rubio, M; Aguilera, A; de Nadal, E; Posas, F",116.0,"[Duch, Alba; Yaakov, Gilad; de Nadal, Eulalia; Posas, Francesc] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Cell Signaling Unit, Dept Ciencies Expt & Salut, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain; [Felipe-Abrio, Irene; Barroso, Sonia; Garcia-Rubio, Maria; Aguilera, Andres] Univ Seville, Ctr Andaluz Biol Mol & Med Regenerat CABIMER, Seville 41092, Spain",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11675,Article,,francesc.posas@upf.edu,+,"Spanish Government [BIO2009-07762, BFU2012-33503, BFU2011-26722, BFU2010-16372, CSD2007-0015]; FP7 UNICELLSYS grant [201142]; Fundacion Marcelino Botin; ICREA Academia (Generalitat de Catalunya)","We thank L.

92,47,295.0,"The Myc oncogene regulates the expression of several components of the protein synthetic machinery, including ribosomal proteins, initiation factors of translation, RNA polymerase III and ribosomal DNA(1,2). Whether and how increasing the cellular protein synthesis capacity affects the multistep process leading to cancer remains to be addressed. Here we use ribosomal protein heterozygote mice as a genetic tool to restore increased protein synthesis in E mu-Myc/+ transgenic mice to normal levels, and show that the oncogenic potential of Myc in this context is suppressed. Our findings demonstrate that the ability of Myc to increase protein synthesis directly augments cell size and is sufficient to accelerate cell cycle progression independently of known cell cycle targets transcriptionally regulated by Myc. In addition, when protein synthesis is restored to normal levels, Myc- overexpressing precancerous cells are more efficiently eliminated by programmed cell death. Our findings reveal a new mechanism that links increases in general protein synthesis rates downstream of an oncogenic signal to a specific molecular impairment in the modality of translation initiation used to regulate the expression of selective messenger RNAs. We show that an aberrant increase in cap- dependent translation downstream of Myc hyperactivation specifically impairs the translational switch to internal ribosomal entry site ( IRES)- dependent translation that is required for accurate mitotic progression. Failure of this translational switch results in reduced mitotic- specific expression of the endogenous IRES- dependent form of Cdk11 ( also known as Cdc21 and PITSLRE)(3-5), which leads to cytokinesis defects and is associated with increased centrosome numbers and genome instability in E mu-Myc/+ mice. When accurate translational control is re- established in E mu-Myc/+ mice, genome instability is suppressed. Our findings demonstrate how perturbations in translational control provide a highly specific outcome for gene expression, genome stability and cancer initiation that have important implications for understanding the molecular mechanism of cancer formation at the post- genomic level.","Barna, Maria; Pusic, Aya; Zollo, Ornella; Costa, Maria; Kondrashov, Nadya; Rego, Eduardo; Rao, Pulivarthi H.; Ruggero, Davide","Barna, M; Pusic, A; Zollo, O; Costa, M; Kondrashov, N; Rego, E; Rao, PH; Ruggero, D",971.0,"[Barna, Maria; Kondrashov, Nadya] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem & Biophys, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Pusic, Aya; Zollo, Ornella; Costa, Maria; Ruggero, Davide] Univ Calif San Francisco, Helen Diller Family Comprehens Canc Ctr, Sch Med, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Pusic, Aya; Zollo, Ornella; Costa, Maria; Ruggero, Davide] Univ Calif San Francisco, Helen Diller Family Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dept Urol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Rego, Eduardo] Univ Sao Paulo, Ctr Cell Based Therapy, Fdn Hemoctr Ribeirao Preto, BR-14048900 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Rao, Pulivarthi H.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Pediat, Houston, TX 77030 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07449,Article,1476-4687,maria.barna@ucsf.edu; Davide.Ruggero@ucsf.edu,U79,NIH; Sandler Foundation,"We thank F.

93,223,342.0,"Gene expression is a multistep process that involves the transcription, translation and turnover of messenger RNAs and proteins. Although it is one of the most fundamental processes of life, the entire cascade has never been quantified on a genome-wide scale. Here we simultaneously measured absolute mRNA and protein abundance and turnover by parallel metabolic pulse labelling for more than 5,000 genes in mammalian cells. Whereas mRNA and protein levels correlated better than previously thought, corresponding half-lives showed no correlation. Using a quantitative model we have obtained the first genome-scale prediction of synthesis rates of mRNAs and proteins. We find that the cellular abundance of proteins is predominantly controlled at the level of translation. Genes with similar combinations of mRNA and protein stability shared functional properties, indicating that half-lives evolved under energetic and dynamic constraints. Quantitative information about all stages of gene expression provides a rich resource and helps to provide a greater understanding of the underlying design principles.","Schwanhaeusser, Bjoern; Busse, Dorothea; Li, Na; Dittmar, Gunnar; Schuchhardt, Johannes; Wolf, Jana; Chen, Wei; Selbach, Matthias","Schwanhausser, B; Busse, D; Li, N; Dittmar, G; Schuchhardt, J; Wolf, J; Chen, W; Selbach, M",337.0,"[Schwanhaeusser, Bjoern; Busse, Dorothea; Li, Na; Dittmar, Gunnar; Wolf, Jana; Chen, Wei; Selbach, Matthias] Max Delbruck Ctr Mol Med, D-13092 Berlin, Germany; [Schuchhardt, Johannes] MicroDiscovery GmbH, D-10405 Berlin, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10098,Article,1476-4687,jana.wolf@mdc-berlin.de; wei.chen@mdc-berlin.de; matthias.selbach@mdc-berlin.de,342,Helmholtz Association; German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF); Senate of Berlin by Berlin Institute of Medical Systems Biology (BIMSB) [315362A]; German Ministry of Education and Research [315289]; Helmholtz Alliance on Systems Biology/MSBN; China Scholarship Council CSC,"We thank N.

94,29,297.0,"Fusarium species are among the most important phytopathogenic and toxigenic fungi. To understand the molecular underpinnings of pathogenicity in the genus Fusarium, we compared the genomes of three phenotypically diverse species: Fusarium graminearum, Fusarium verticillioides and Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici. Our analysis revealed lineage-specific (LS) genomic regions in F. oxysporum that include four entire chromosomes and account for more than one-quarter of the genome. LS regions are rich in transposons and genes with distinct evolutionary profiles but related to pathogenicity, indicative of horizontal acquisition. Experimentally, we demonstrate the transfer of two LS chromosomes between strains of F. oxysporum, converting a non-pathogenic strain into a pathogen. Transfer of LS chromosomes between otherwise genetically isolated strains explains the polyphyletic origin of host specificity and the emergence of new pathogenic lineages in F. oxysporum. These findings put the evolution of fungal pathogenicity into a new perspective.","Ma, Li-Jun; van der Does, H.

95,104,254.0,"The centrosome organizes the microtubule cytoskeleton and consists of a pair of centrioles surrounded by pericentriolar material. Cells begin the cell cycle with a single centrosome, which duplicates once before mitosis. During duplication, new centrioles grow orthogonally to existing ones and remain engaged ( tightly opposed) with those centrioles until late mitosis or early G1 phase, when they become disengaged(1). The relationship between centriole engagement/disengagement and centriole duplication potential is not understood, and the mechanisms that control these processes are not known. Here we show that centriole disengagement requires the protease separase(2) at anaphase, and that this disengagement licences centriole duplication in the next cell cycle. We describe an in vitro system using Xenopus egg extract and purified centrioles in which both centriole disengagement and centriole growth occur. Centriole disengagement at anaphase is independent of mitotic exit and Cdk2/cyclin E activity, but requires the anaphase-promoting complex and separase. In contrast to disengagement, new centriole growth occurs in interphase, is dependent on Cdk2/cyclin E, and requires previously disengaged centrioles. This suggests that re-duplication of centrioles within a cell cycle is prevented by centriole engagement itself. We propose that the 'once-only' control of centrosome duplication is achieved by temporally separating licensing in anaphase from growth of new centrioles during S phase. The involvement of separase in both centriole disengagement and sister chromatid separation would prevent premature centriole disengagement before anaphase onset, which can lead to multipolar spindles and genomic instability(3,4).","Tsou, Meng-Fu Bryan; Stearns, Tim","Tsou, MFB; Stearns, T",947.0,"Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature04985,Article,,stearns@stanford.edu,951,,,076LT,,,SISTER-CHROMATID SEPARATION; CENTRIOLE; MITOSIS; KINASE; ONCOPROTEIN; INSTABILITY; PROGRESSION; CDK2-CYCLIN; CHROMOSOME; INTERPHASE,7105.0,NATURE,Nature,English,28.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",24-Aug,5.0,LONDON,16862117.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,,"Stearns, T (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,247.0,Mechanism limiting centrosome duplication to once per cell cycle,0.0,15.0,WOS:000239960500044,254.0,442,Multidisciplinary Sciences,249,tim,stearns,13382.0,2949,male,0.99,C1c54H4AAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",52067867,1,52067867,1,Tim Stearns,Tim Stearns,1,1
96,121,73.0,"Mutations that deregulate Notch1 and Ras/phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt signalling are prevalent in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL), and often coexist. Here we show that the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 is active against primary T-ALLs from wild-type and Kras(G12D) mice, and addition of the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 increases its efficacy. Mice invariably relapsed after treatment with drug-resistant clones, most of which unexpectedly had reduced levels of activated Notch1 protein, downregulated many Notch1 target genes, and exhibited cross-resistance to gamma-secretase inhibitors. Multiple resistant primary T-ALLs that emerged in vivo did not contain somatic Notch1 mutations present in the parental leukaemia. Importantly, resistant clones upregulated PI3K signalling. Consistent with these data, inhibiting Notch1 activated the PI3K pathway, providing a likely mechanism for selection against oncogenic Notch1 signalling. These studies validate PI3K as a therapeutic target in T-ALL and raise the unexpected possibility that dual inhibition of PI3K and Notch1 signalling could promote drug resistance in T-ALL.","Dail, Monique; Wong, Jason; Lawrence, Jessica; O'Connor, Daniel; Nakitandwe, Joy; Chen, Shann-Ching; Xu, Jin; Lee, Leslie B.; Akagi, Keiko; Li, Qing; Aster, Jon C.; Pear, Warren S.; Downing, James R.; Sampath, Deepak; Shannon, Kevin","Dail, M; Wong, J; Lawrence, J; O'Connor, D; Nakitandwe, J; Chen, SC; Xu, J; Lee, LB; Akagi, K; Li, Q; Aster, JC; Pear, WS; Downing, JR; Sampath, D; Shannon, K",512.0,"[Dail, Monique; Wong, Jason; Lawrence, Jessica; O'Connor, Daniel; Xu, Jin; Shannon, Kevin] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pediat, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Dail, Monique; Wong, Jason; Lawrence, Jessica; O'Connor, Daniel; Xu, Jin; Shannon, Kevin] Univ Calif San Francisco, Benniof Childrens Hosp, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Nakitandwe, Joy; Chen, Shann-Ching; Downing, James R.] St Jude Childrens Res Hosp, Dept Pathol, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Lee, Leslie B.; Sampath, Deepak] Genentech Inc, Dept Translat Oncol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Akagi, Keiko] Ohio State Univ, Dept Mol Virol Immunol & Med Genet, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Li, Qing] Univ Michigan, Dept Med, Div Haematol Oncol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Aster, Jon C.] Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Pear, Warren S.] Univ Penn, Abramson Family Canc Res Inst, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Pear, Warren S.] Univ Penn, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Perelman Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13495,Article,1476-4687,shannonk@peds.ucsf.edu,+,"William Lawrence and Blanche Hughes Foundation; Specialized Center of Research (SCOR) from the Leukaemia and Lymphoma Society of America [7019, 7703]; National Institutes of Health [R37 CA72614, R01 CA180037, K99 CA157950, K08 CA134649, P01 CA119070]; ALSAC of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital; Ohio Supercomputer Center [PAS0425]; Ohio Cancer Research Associate [GRT00024299]; American Cancer Society (ACS)","This work was supported by grants from the William Lawrence and Blanche Hughes Foundation to J.C.A. and K.

97,33,384.0,"Benzodiazepines are widely used in clinics and for recreational purposes, but will lead to addiction in vulnerable individuals. Addictive drugs increase the levels of dopamine and also trigger long-lasting synaptic adaptations in the mesolimbic reward system that ultimately may induce the pathological behaviour. The neural basis for the addictive nature of benzodiazepines, however, remains elusive. Here we show that benzodiazepines increase firing of dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area through the positive modulation of GABA(A) (gamma-aminobutyric acid type A) receptors in nearby interneurons. Such disinhibition, which relies on alpha 1-containing GABA(A) receptors expressed in these cells, triggers drug-evoked synaptic plasticity in excitatory afferents onto dopamine neurons and underlies drug reinforcement. Taken together, our data provide evidence that benzodiazepines share defining pharmacological features of addictive drugs through cell-type-specific expression of alpha 1-containing GABA(A) receptors in the ventral tegmental area. The data also indicate that subunit-selective benzodiazepines sparing alpha 1 may be devoid of addiction liability.","Tan, Kelly R.; Brown, Matthew; Labouebe, Gwenael; Yvon, Cedric; Creton, Cyril; Fritschy, Jean-Marc; Rudolph, Uwe; Luescher, Christian","Tan, KR; Brown, M; Labouebe, G; Yvon, C; Creton, C; Fritschy, JM; Rudolph, U; Luscher, C",769.0,"[Tan, Kelly R.; Brown, Matthew; Labouebe, Gwenael; Yvon, Cedric; Creton, Cyril; Luescher, Christian] Univ Geneva, Dept Basic Neurosci, Fac Med, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Fritschy, Jean-Marc] Univ Zurich, Inst Pharmacol & Toxicol, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Rudolph, Uwe] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Lab Genet Neuropharmacol, McLean Hosp, Belmont, MA 02478 USA; [Rudolph, Uwe] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Belmont, MA 02478 USA; [Luescher, Christian] Univ Hosp Geneva, Dept Clin Neurosci, Neurol Clin, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Luescher, Christian] Geneva Neurosci Ctr, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08758,Article,,christian.luscher@unige.ch,U78,National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) [DA019022]; Swiss National Science Foundation; Swiss Initiative in Systems Biology; European Commission [LSHM-CT-2005-19063],"We thank members of the Luscher laboratory as well as M.

98,10,179.0,"Computation in the nervous system often relies on the integration of signals from parallel circuits with different functional properties. Correlated noise in these inputs can, in principle, have diverse and dramatic effects on the reliability of the resulting computations(1-8). Such theoretical predictions have rarely been tested experimentally because of a scarcity of preparations that permit measurement of both the covariation of a neuron's input signals and the effect on a cell's output of manipulating such covariation. Here we introduce a method to measure covariation of the excitatory and inhibitory inputs a cell receives. This method revealed strong correlated noise in the inputs to two types of retinal ganglion cell. Eliminating correlated noise without changing other input properties substantially decreased the accuracy with which a cell's spike outputs encoded light inputs. Thus, covariation of excitatory and inhibitory inputs can be a critical determinant of the reliability of neural coding and computation.","Cafaro, Jon; Rieke, Fred","Cafaro, J; Rieke, F",964.0,"[Rieke, Fred] Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Cafaro, Jon; Rieke, Fred] Univ Washington, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09570,Article,,rieke@u.washington.edu,U363,HHMI; NIH [EY-11850],"We thank D.

99,141,15.0,"Ancient genomic sequences have started to reveal the origin and the demographic impact of farmers from the Neolithic period spreading into Europe(1-3). The adoption of farming, stock breeding and sedentary societies during the Neolithic may have resulted in adaptive changes in genes associated with immunity and diet(4). However, the limited data available from earlier hunter-gatherers preclude an understanding of the selective processes associated with this crucial transition to agriculture in recent human evolution. Here we sequence an approximately 7,000-year-old Mesolithic skeleton discovered at the La Brana-Arintero site in Leon, Spain, to retrieve a complete pre-agricultural European human genome. Analysis of this genome in the context of other ancient samples suggests the existence of a common ancient genomic signature across western and central Eurasia from the Upper Paleolithic to the Mesolithic. The La Brana individual carries ancestral alleles in several skin pigmentation genes, suggesting that the light skin of modern Europeans was not yet ubiquitous in Mesolithic times. Moreover, we provide evidence that a significant number of derived, putatively adaptive variants associated with pathogen resistance in modern Europeans were already present in this hunter-gatherer.","Olalde, Inigo; Allentoft, Morten E.; Sanchez-Quinto, Federico; Santpere, Gabriel; Chiang, Charleston W.

100,80,224.0,"Morphogens act in developing tissues to control the spatial arrangement of cellular differentiation(1,2). The activity of a morphogen has generally been viewed as a concentration-dependent response to a diffusible signal, but the duration of morphogen signalling can also affect cellular responses(3). One such example is the morphogen sonic hedgehog (SHH). In the vertebrate central nervous system and limbs, the pattern of cellular differentiation is controlled by both the amount and the time of SHH exposure(4-7). How these two parameters are interpreted at a cellular level has been unclear. Here we provide evidence that changing the concentration or duration of SHH has an equivalent effect on intracellular signalling. Chick neural cells convert different concentrations of SHH into time-limited periods of signal transduction, such that signal duration is proportional to SHH concentration. This depends on the gradual desensitization of cells to ongoing SHH exposure, mediated by the SHH-dependent upregulation of patched 1 (PTC1), a ligand-binding inhibitor of SHH signalling(8). Thus, in addition to its role in shaping the SHH gradient(8-10), PTC1 participates cell autonomously in gradient sensing. Together, the data reveal a novel strategy for morphogen interpretation, in which the temporal adaptation of cells to a morphogen integrates the concentration and duration of a signal to control differential gene expression.","Dessaud, Eric; Yang, Lin Lin; Hill, Katy; Cox, Barny; Ulloa, Fausto; Ribeiro, Ana; Mynett, Anita; Novitch, Bennett G.; Briscoe, James","Dessaud, E; Yang, LL; Hill, K; Cox, B; Ulloa, F; Ribeiro, A; Mynett, A; Novitch, BG; Briscoe, J",717.0,"Natl Inst Med Res, London NW7 1AA, England; Univ Michigan, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06347,Article,1476-4687,james.briscoe@nimr.mrc.ac.uk,U7,Medical Research Council [MC_U117560541]; NINDS NIH HHS [R01 NS072804],,235BY,,,PROGENITOR-CELL IDENTITY; VENTRAL NEURAL-TUBE; NEURONAL FATE; FLOOR PLATE; TRANSDUCTION; SPECIFICATION; INDUCTION; GENE; PATHWAY; PATTERN,7170.0,NATURE,Nature,English,33.0,No,"Novitch, Bennett/0000-0002-2696-3708; Dessaud, Eric/0000-0001-9723-6658; Briscoe, James/0000-0002-1020-5240","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",29-Nov,5.0,LONDON,18046410.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007.0,,"Briscoe, J (reprint author), Natl Inst Med Res, Mill Hill, London NW7 1AA, England.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,256.0,Interpretation of the sonic hedgehog morphogen gradient by a temporal adaptation mechanism,0.0,16.0,WOS:000251209700053,224.0,450,Multidisciplinary Sciences,258,james,briscoe,14198.0,6359,male,0.99,VJ83sekAAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",45465524,1,28802773,1,Jim Briscoe,Jim Briscoe,1,1

Here we used two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy(11-13) to monitor the activity of two Rho GTPases-RhoA and Cdc42-in single dendritic spines undergoing structural plasticity associated with long-term potentiation in CA1 pyramidal neurons in cultured slices of rat hippocampus. When long-term volume increase was induced in a single spine using two-photon glutamate uncaging(14,15), RhoA and Cdc42 were rapidly activated in the stimulated spine. These activities decayed over about five minutes, and were then followed by a phase of persistent activation lasting more than half an hour. Although active RhoA and Cdc42 were similarly mobile, their activity patterns were different. RhoA activation diffused out of the stimulated spine and spread over about 5 mm along the dendrite. In contrast, Cdc42 activation was restricted to the stimulated spine, and exhibited a steep gradient at the spine necks. Inhibition of the Rho-Rock pathway preferentially inhibited the initial spine growth, whereas the inhibition of the Cdc42-Pak pathway blocked the maintenance of sustained structural plasticity. RhoA and Cdc42 activation depended on Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase (CaMKII). Thus, RhoA and Cdc42 relay transient CaMKII activation(13) to synapse-specific, long-term signalling required for spine structural plasticity.","Murakoshi, Hideji; Wang, Hong; Yasuda, Ryohei","Murakoshi, H; Wang, H; Yasuda, R",100.0,"[Murakoshi, Hideji; Wang, Hong; Yasuda, Ryohei] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Neurobiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Yasuda, Ryohei] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Durham, NC 27710 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09823,Article,,yasuda@neuro.duke.edu,U132,Howard Hughes Medical Institute; National Institute of Mental Health; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke; National Institute of Drug Abuse; Alzheimer's Association; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science,"We thank K.

However, the downstream translationally regulated nodes of gene expression that may direct cancer development are poorly characterized. Using ribosome profiling, we uncover specialized translation of the prostate cancer genome by oncogenic mTOR signalling, revealing a remarkably specific repertoire of genes involved in cell proliferation, metabolism and invasion. We extend these findings by functionally characterizing a class of translationally controlled pro-invasion messenger RNAs that we show direct prostate cancer invasion and metastasis downstream of oncogenic mTOR signalling. Furthermore, we develop a clinically relevant ATP site inhibitor of mTOR, INK128, which reprograms this gene expression signature with therapeutic benefit for prostate cancer metastasis, for which there is presently no cure. Together, these findings extend our understanding of how the 'cancerous' translation machinery steers specific cancer cell behaviours, including metastasis, and may be therapeutically targeted.","Hsieh, Andrew C.; Liu, Yi; Edlind, Merritt P.; Ingolia, Nicholas T.; Janes, Matthew R.; Sher, Annie; Shi, Evan Y.; Stumpf, Craig R.; Christensen, Carly; Bonham, Michael J.; Wang, Shunyou; Ren, Pingda; Martin, Michael; Jessen, Katti; Feldman, Morris E.; Weissman, Jonathan S.; Shokat, Kevan M.; Rommel, Christian; Ruggero, Davide","Hsieh, AC; Liu, Y; Edlind, MP; Ingolia, NT; Janes, MR; Sher, A; Shi, EY; Stumpf, CR; Christensen, C; Bonham, MJ; Wang, SY; Ren, PD; Martin, M; Jessen, K; Feldman, ME; Weissman, JS; Shokat, KM; Rommel, C; Ruggero, D",55.0,"[Hsieh, Andrew C.; Edlind, Merritt P.; Sher, Annie; Shi, Evan Y.; Stumpf, Craig R.; Christensen, Carly; Ruggero, Davide] Univ Calif San Francisco, Helen Diller Family Comprehens Canc Ctr, Sch Med, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Hsieh, Andrew C.; Edlind, Merritt P.; Sher, Annie; Shi, Evan Y.; Stumpf, Craig R.; Christensen, Carly; Ruggero, Davide] Univ Calif San Francisco, Helen Diller Family Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dept Urol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Hsieh, Andrew C.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Internal Med, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Hsieh, Andrew C.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Div Hematol Oncol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Liu, Yi; Janes, Matthew R.; Wang, Shunyou; Ren, Pingda; Martin, Michael; Jessen, Katti; Rommel, Christian] Intellikine Inc, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Ingolia, Nicholas T.] Carnegie Inst Sci, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Bonham, Michael J.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pathol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Feldman, Morris E.; Weissman, Jonathan S.; Shokat, Kevan M.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Cellular & Mol Pharmacol, Howard Hughes Med Inst, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10912,Article,,christian@intellikine.com; davide.ruggero@ucsf.edu,U196,"American Cancer Society [119084-PF-10-233-01-TBE]; DOD; NIH [R01 CA154916, R01 CA140456]; Phi Beta Psi Sorority","We thank M.

103,77,159.0,"Understanding the transmission of sensory information at individual synaptic connections requires knowledge of the properties of presynaptic terminals and their patterns of firing evoked by sensory stimuli. Such information has been difficult to obtain because of the small size and inaccessibility of nerve terminals in the central nervous system. Here we show, by making direct patch- clamp recordings in vivo from cerebellar mossy fibre boutons - the primary source of synaptic input to the cerebellar cortex(1,2) - that sensory stimulation can produce bursts of spikes in single boutons at very high instantaneous firing frequencies ( more than 700 Hz). We show that the mossy fibre - granule cell synapse exhibits high- fidelity transmission at these frequencies, indicating that the rapid burst of excitatory postsynaptic currents underlying the sensory- evoked response of granule cells(3) can be driven by such a presynaptic spike burst. We also demonstrate that a single mossy fibre can trigger action potential bursts in granule cells in vitro when driven with in vivo firing patterns. These findings suggest that the relay from mossy fibre to granule cell can act in a 'detonator' fashion, such that a single presynaptic afferent may be sufficient to transmit the sensory message. This endows the cerebellar mossy fibre system with remarkable sensitivity and high fidelity in the transmission of sensory information.","Rancz, Ede A.; Ishikawa, Taro; Duguid, Ian; Chadderton, Paul; Mahon, Severine; Haeusser, Michael","Rancz, EA; Ishikawa, T; Duguid, I; Chadderton, P; Mahon, S; Hausser, M",1245.0,"UCL, Wolfson Inst Biomed Res, London WC1E 6BT, England; UCL, Dept Physiol, London WC1E 6BT, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature05995,Article,,m.hausser@ucl.ac.uk,U12,"Wellcome Trust [, 068699]",,243HA,,,GRANULE CELL LAYER; IN-VIVO; PURKINJE-CELLS; RAT; RESPONSES; SYNAPSE; CORTEX; BRAIN; INTEGRATION; MORPHOLOGY,7173.0,NATURE,Nature,English,33.0,No,"Rancz, Ede Attila/0000-0002-7951-1385; Chadderton, Paul/0000-0002-6276-1011","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",20-Dec,5.0,LONDON,18097412.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007.0,"Mahon, Severine/E-7195-2017","Hausser, M (reprint author), UCL, Wolfson Inst Biomed Res, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,153.0,High-fidelity transmission of sensory information by single cerebellar mossy fibre boutons,1.0,11.0,WOS:000251786200053,159.0,450,Multidisciplinary Sciences,154,michael,haeusser,14605.0,11094,male,1.0,yhMNQoQAAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
104,56,76.0,"Natural selection dictates that cells constantly adapt to dynamically changing environments in a context- dependent manner. Gene- regulatory networks often mediate the cellular response to perturbation(1-3), and an understanding of cellular adaptation will require experimental approaches aimed at subjecting cells to a dynamic environment that mimics their natural habitat(4-9). Here we monitor the response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolic gene regulation to periodic changes in the external carbon source by using a microfluidic platform that allows precise, dynamic control over environmental conditions. We show that the metabolic system acts as a low- pass filter that reliably responds to a slowly changing environment, while effectively ignoring fast fluctuations. The sensitive low- frequency response was significantly faster than in predictions arising from our computational modelling, and this discrepancy was resolved by the discovery that two key galactose transcripts possess half- lives that depend on the carbon source. Finally, to explore how induction characteristics affect frequency response, we compare two S. cerevisiae strains and show that they have the same frequency response despite having markedly different induction properties. This suggests that although certain characteristics of the complex networks may differ when probed in a static environment, the system has been optimized for a robust response to a dynamically changing environment.","Bennett, Matthew R.; Pang, Wyming Lee; Ostroff, Natalie A.; Baumgartner, Bridget L.; Nayak, Sujata; Tsimring, Lev S.; Hasty, Jeff","Bennett, MR; Pang, WL; Ostroff, NA; Baumgartner, BL; Nayak, S; Tsimring, LS; Hasty, J",1119.0,"[Bennett, Matthew R.; Pang, Wyming Lee; Ostroff, Natalie A.; Baumgartner, Bridget L.; Nayak, Sujata; Hasty, Jeff] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Bioengn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Bennett, Matthew R.; Tsimring, Lev S.; Hasty, Jeff] Univ Calif San Diego, Inst Nonlinear Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07211,Article,1476-4687,hasty@ucsd.edu,1122,National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health,"We thank A.

105,228,445.0,"Eukaryotic genomes consist to a significant extent of retrotransposons that are suppressed by host epigenetic mechanisms, preventing their uncontrolled propagation(1,2). However, it is not clear how this is achieved. Here we show that in Arabidopsis seedlings subjected to heat stress, a copia-type retrotransposon named ONSEN (Japanese 'hot spring') not only became transcriptionally active but also synthesized extrachromosomal DNA copies. Heat-induced ONSEN accumulation was stimulated in mutants impaired in the biogenesis of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs); however, there was no evidence of transposition occurring in vegetative tissues. After stress, both ONSEN transcripts and extrachromosomal DNA gradually decayed and were no longer detected after 20-30 days. Surprisingly, a high frequency of new ONSEN insertions was observed in the progeny of stressed plants deficient in siRNAs. Insertion patterns revealed that this transgenerational retrotransposition occurred during flower development and before gametogenesis. Therefore in plants with compromised siRNA biogenesis, memory of stress was maintained throughout development, priming ONSEN to transpose during differentiation of generative organs. Retrotransposition was not observed in the progeny of wild-type plants subjected to stress or in non-stressed mutant controls, pointing to a crucial role of the siRNA pathway in restricting retrotransposition triggered by environmental stress. Finally, we found that natural and experimentally induced variants in ONSEN insertions confer heat responsiveness to nearby genes, and therefore mobility bursts may generate novel, stress-responsive regulatory gene networks.","Ito, Hidetaka; Gaubert, Herve; Bucher, Etienne; Mirouze, Marie; Vaillant, Isabelle; Paszkowski, Jerzy","Ito, H; Gaubert, H; Bucher, E; Mirouze, M; Vaillant, I; Paszkowski, J",115.0,"[Ito, Hidetaka; Gaubert, Herve; Bucher, Etienne; Mirouze, Marie; Vaillant, Isabelle; Paszkowski, Jerzy] Univ Geneva, Dept Plant Biol, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09861,Article,,jerzy.paszkowski@unige.ch,U151,Swiss National Science Foundation [31003A-125005]; European Commission [FP7 226477]; RECBREED consortium [FP7 227190]; Epigenome Network of Excellence [FP6 503433],"We thank all members of the J.P. laboratory and R.

106,152,305.0,"The coupling of electrons to matter lies at the heart of our understanding of material properties such as electrical conductivity. Electron-phonon coupling can lead to the formation of a Cooper pair out of two repelling electrons, which forms the basis for Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer superconductivity(1). Here we study the interaction of a single localized electron with a Bose-Einstein condensate and show that the electron can excite phonons and eventually trigger a collective oscillation of the whole condensate. We find that the coupling is surprisingly strong compared to that of ionic impurities, owing to the more favourable mass ratio. The electron is held in place by a single charged ionic core, forming a Rydberg bound state. This Rydberg electron is described by a wavefunction extending to a size of up to eight micrometres, comparable to the dimensions of the condensate. In such a state, corresponding to a principal quantum number of n = 202, the Rydberg electron is interacting with several tens of thousands of condensed atoms contained within its orbit. We observe surprisingly long lifetimes and finite size effects caused by the electron exploring the outer regions of the condensate. We anticipate future experiments on electron orbital imaging, the investigation of phonon-mediated coupling of single electrons, and applications in quantum optics.","Balewski, Jonathan B.; Krupp, Alexander T.; Gaj, Anita; Peter, David; Buechler, Hans Peter; Loew, Robert; Hofferberth, Sebastian; Pfau, Tilman","Balewski, JB; Krupp, AT; Gaj, A; Peter, D; Buchler, HP; Low, R; Hofferberth, S; Pfau, T",664.0,"[Balewski, Jonathan B.; Krupp, Alexander T.; Gaj, Anita; Loew, Robert; Hofferberth, Sebastian; Pfau, Tilman] Univ Stuttgart, Phys Inst 5, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany; [Peter, David; Buechler, Hans Peter] Univ Stuttgart, Inst Theoret Phys 3, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12592,Article,1476-4687,t.pfau@physik.uni-stuttgart.de,667,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [SFB/TRR21, PF 381/4-2]; ERC [267100]; EU Marie Curie programme ITN-Coherence [265031]; DFG [HO 4787/1-1]","We thank K.

107,73,479.0,"The thermal structure of the crust strongly influences deformation, metamorphism and plutonism(1-3). Models for the geothermal gradient in stable crust predict a steady increase of temperature with depth. This thermal structure, however, is incompatible with observations from high- temperature metamorphic terranes exhumed in orogens(1,4,5,6). Global compilations(7) of peak conditions in high- temperature metamorphic terranes define relatively narrow ranges of peak temperatures over a wide range in pressure, for both isothermal decompression and isobaric cooling paths. Here we develop simple one- dimensional thermal models that include the effects of melt migration. These models show that long- lived plutonism results in a quasi- steady- state geotherm with a rapid temperature increase in the upper crust and nearly isothermal conditions in the middle and lower crust. The models also predict that the upward advection of heat by melt generates granulite facies metamorphism, and widespread andalusite - sillimanite metamorphism in the upper crust. Once the quasi- steady- state thermal profile is reached, the middle and lower crust are greatly weakened due to high temperatures and anatectic conditions, thus setting the stage for gravitational collapse(8), exhumation and isothermal decompression after the onset of plutonism. Near- iso-thermal conditions in the middle and lower crust result from the thermal buffering effect of dehydration melting reactions that, in part, control the shape of the geotherm.","Depine, Gabriela V.; Andronicos, Christopher L.; Phipps-Morgan, Jason","Depine, GV; Andronicos, CL; Phipps-Morgan, J",80.0,"[Depine, Gabriela V.; Andronicos, Christopher L.; Phipps-Morgan, Jason] Cornell Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06689,Article,1476-4687,gvd2@cornell.edu,83,,,269SZ,,,THERMAL-PROCESSES; BRITISH-COLUMBIA; OROGENIC BELTS; GRANITE; FLOW; METAMORPHISM; EMPLACEMENT; MOUNTAINS; ANATEXIS; SOLIDUS,7183.0,NATURE,Nature,English,34.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",6-Mar,4.0,LONDON,18322532.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,,"Depine, GV (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Snee Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,34.0,Near-isothermal conditions in the middle and lower crust induced by melt migration,2.0,19.0,WOS:000253671900050,479.0,452,Multidisciplinary Sciences,34,jason,phipps-morgan,9583.0,4927,male,1.0,D2TRutgAAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",45641474,1,673711,1,Morgan (2016 film),Morgan (2016 film),0,0
108,3,76.0,"X-ray lasers offer new capabilities in understanding the structure of biological systems, complex materials and matter under extreme conditions(1-4). Very short and extremely bright, coherent X-ray pulses can be used to outrun key damage processes and obtain a single diffraction pattern from a large macromolecule, a virus or a cell before the sample explodes and turns into plasma(1). The continuous diffraction pattern of non-crystalline objects permits oversampling and direct phase retrieval(2). Here we show that high-quality diffraction data can be obtained with a single X-ray pulse from a noncrystalline biological sample, a single mimivirus particle, which was injected into the pulsed beam of a hard-X-ray free-electron laser, the Linac Coherent Light Source(5). Calculations indicate that the energy deposited into the virus by the pulse heated the particle to over 100,000 K after the pulse had left the sample. The reconstructed exit wavefront (image) yielded 32-nm full-period resolution in a single exposure and showed no measurable damage. The reconstruction indicates inhomogeneous arrangement of dense material inside the virion. We expect that significantly higher resolutions will be achieved in such experiments with shorter and brighter photon pulses focused to a smaller area. The resolution in such experiments can be further extended for samples available in multiple identical copies.","Seibert, M. Marvin; Ekeberg, Tomas; Maia, Filipe R. N.

109,113,104.0,"When used in combination with raster scanning, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) has proven to be a valuable imaging technique of the nanoscale(1), for example of bone, teeth and brain matter(2-5). Although two-dimensional projection imaging has been used to characterize various materials successfully, its three-dimensional extension, SAXS computed tomography, poses substantial challenges, which have yet to be overcome. Previous work(6-11) using SAXS computed tomography was unable to preserve oriented SAXS signals during reconstruction. Here we present a solution to this problem and obtain a complete SAXS computed tomography, which preserves oriented scattering information. By introducing virtual tomography axes, we take advantage of the two-dimensional SAXS information recorded on an area detector and use it to reconstruct the full three-dimensional scattering distribution in reciprocal space for each voxel of the three-dimensional object in real space. The presented method could be of interest for a combined six-dimensional real and reciprocal space characterization of mesoscopic materials with hierarchically structured features with length scales ranging from a few nanometres to a few millimetres-for example, biomaterials such as bone or teeth, or functional materials such as fuel-cell or battery components.","Schaff, Florian; Bech, Martin; Zaslansky, Paul; Jud, Christoph; Liebi, Marianne; Guizar-Sicairos, Manuel; Pfeiffer, Franz","Schaff, F; Bech, M; Zaslansky, P; Jud, C; Liebi, M; Guizar-Sicairos, M; Pfeiffer, F",353.0,"[Schaff, Florian; Jud, Christoph; Pfeiffer, Franz] Tech Univ Munich, Lehrstuhl Biomed Phys, Dept Phys, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Schaff, Florian; Jud, Christoph; Pfeiffer, Franz] Tech Univ Munich, Inst Med Tech, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Bech, Martin] Lund Univ, Dept Med Radiat Phys, Clin Sci, S-22185 Lund, Sweden; [Zaslansky, Paul] Charite, Julius Wolff Inst, D-13353 Berlin, Germany; [Liebi, Marianne; Guizar-Sicairos, Manuel] Paul Scherrer Inst, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland; [Pfeiffer, Franz] Tech Univ Munich, Klinikum Rechts Isar, Inst Diagnost & Interventionelle Radiol, D-81675 Munich, Germany",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature16060,Article,1476-4687,florian.schaff@tum.de; martin.bech@med.lu.se; franz.pfeiffer@tum.de,+,DFG Cluster of Excellence Munich-Centre for Advanced Photonics (MAP); DFG Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz program; DFG (German Research Foundation) [SPP1420]; TUM Graduate School; TUM Institute for Advanced Studies (TUM-IAS),"The SAXS experiments were performed at the cSAXS beamline of the Swiss Light Source (SLS) at the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI), Villigen, Switzerland.

110,226,413.0,"TRIM5 is a RING domain-E3 ubiquitin ligase that restricts infection by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 and other retroviruses immediately following virus invasion of the target cell cytoplasm(1,2). Antiviral potency correlates with TRIM5 avidity for the retrovirion capsid lattice(3,4) and several reports indicate that TRIM5 has a role in signal transduction(5-7), but the precise mechanism of restriction is unknown(8). Here we demonstrate that TRIM5 promotes innate immune signalling and that this activity is amplified by retroviral infection and interaction with the capsid lattice. Acting with the heterodimeric, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC13-UEV1A (also known as UBE2N-UBE2V1), TRIM5 catalyses the synthesis of unattached K63-linked ubiquitin chains that activate the TAK1 (also known as MAP3K7) kinase complex and stimulate AP-1 and NF kappa B signalling. Interaction with the HIV-1 capsid lattice greatly enhances the UBC13-UEV1A-dependent E3 activity of TRIM5 and challenge with retroviruses induces the transcription of AP-1 and NF-kappa B-dependent factors with a magnitude that tracks with TRIM5 avidity for the invading capsid. Finally, TAK1 and UBC13-UEV1A contribute to capsid-specific restriction by TRIM5. Thus, the retroviral restriction factor TRIM5 has two additional activities that are linked to restriction: it constitutively promotes innate immune signalling and it acts as a pattern recognition receptor specific for the retrovirus capsid lattice.","Pertel, Thomas; Hausmann, Stephane; Morger, Damien; Zueger, Sara; Guerra, Jessica; Lascano, Josefina; Reinhard, Christian; Santoni, Federico A.; Uchil, Pradeep D.; Chatel, Laurence; Bisiaux, Aurelie; Albert, Matthew L.; Strambio-De-Castillia, Caterina; Mothes, Walther; Pizzato, Massimo; Gruetter, Markus G.; Luban, Jeremy","Pertel, T; Hausmann, S; Morger, D; Zuger, S; Guerra, J; Lascano, J; Reinhard, C; Santoni, FA; Uchil, PD; Chatel, L; Bisiaux, A; Albert, ML; Strambio-De-Castillia, C; Mothes, W; Pizzato, M; Grutter, MG; Luban, J",361.0,"[Pertel, Thomas; Hausmann, Stephane; Guerra, Jessica; Lascano, Josefina; Reinhard, Christian; Santoni, Federico A.; Strambio-De-Castillia, Caterina; Pizzato, Massimo; Luban, Jeremy] Univ Geneva, Dept Microbiol & Mol Med, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Morger, Damien; Zueger, Sara; Gruetter, Markus G.] Univ Zurich, Dept Biochem, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Uchil, Pradeep D.; Mothes, Walther] Yale Univ, Sect Microbial Pathogenesis, Sch Med, New Haven, CT 06536 USA; [Chatel, Laurence] Novimmune SA, CH-1228 Geneva, Switzerland; [Bisiaux, Aurelie; Albert, Matthew L.] Inst Pasteur, INSERM, U818, F-75724 Paris, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09976,Article,1476-4687,jeremy.luban@unige.ch,365,"NIH [RO1AI59159, R21AI087467]; Swiss National Science Foundation [3100A0-128655, 3100A0-122342]; UZH Forschungskredit [54041402]","We thank D.

111,70,402.0,"Ferroelectric thin films and superlattices are currently the subject of intensive research(1,2) because of the interest they raise for technological applications and also because their properties are of fundamental scientific importance(3-5). Ferroelectric superlattices(6) allow the tuning of the ferroelectric properties while maintaining perfect crystal structure and a coherent strain, even throughout relatively thick samples. This tuning is achieved in practice by adjusting both the strain(7-10), to enhance the polarization, and the composition, to interpolate between the properties of the combined compounds(11-15). Here we show that superlattices with very short periods possess a new form of interface coupling, based on rotational distortions, which gives rise to 'improper' ferroelectricity. These observations suggest an approach, based on interface engineering, to produce artificial materials with unique properties. By considering ferroelectric/paraelectric PbTiO3/SrTiO3 multilayers, we first show from first principles that the groundstate of the system is not purely ferroelectric but also primarily involves antiferrodistortive rotations of the oxygen atoms in a way compatible with improper ferroelectricity. We then demonstrate experimentally that, in contrast to pure PbTiO3 and SrTiO3 compounds, the multilayer system indeed behaves like a prototypical improper ferroelectric and exhibits a very large dielectric constant of epsilon(r)approximate to 600, which is also fairly temperature-independent. This behaviour, of practical interest for technological applications(16), is distinct from that of normal ferroelectrics, for which the dielectric constant is typically large but strongly evolves around the phase transition temperature and also differs from that of previously known improper ferroelectrics that exhibit a temperature-independent but small dielectric constant only.","Bousquet, Eric; Dawber, Matthew; Stucki, Nicolas; Lichtensteiger, Celine; Hermet, Patrick; Gariglio, Stefano; Triscone, Jean-Marc; Ghosez, Philippe","Bousquet, E; Dawber, M; Stucki, N; Lichtensteiger, C; Hermet, P; Gariglio, S; Triscone, JM; Ghosez, P",732.0,"[Bousquet, Eric; Hermet, Patrick; Ghosez, Philippe] Univ Liege, B-4000 Sart Tilman Par Liege, Belgium; [Dawber, Matthew; Stucki, Nicolas; Lichtensteiger, Celine; Gariglio, Stefano; Triscone, Jean-Marc] Univ Geneva, DPMC, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06817,Article,,matthew.dawber@stonybrook.edu; philippe.ghosez@ulg.ac.be,U4,,,285QY,Y,N,THIN-FILMS; POLARIZATION ENHANCEMENT; 1ST-PRINCIPLES; BATIO3; SRTIO3,7188.0,NATURE,Nature,English,35.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",10-Apr,6.0,LONDON,18401406.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,"Ghosez, Philippe/F-1954-2014","Ghosez, P (reprint author), Univ Liege, Allee 6 Aout 17 B5, B-4000 Sart Tilman Par Liege, Belgium.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,415.0,Improper ferroelectricity in perovskite oxide artificial superlattices,31.0,364.0,WOS:000254792500041,402.0,452,Multidisciplinary Sciences,417,philippe,ghosez,14131.0,605,male,0.99,bKwqdp4AAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0

Here we sequence to high coverage a total of 79 wild-and captive-born individuals representing all six great ape species and seven subspecies and report 88.8 million single nucleotide polymorphisms. Our analysis provides support for genetically distinct populations within each species, signals of gene flow, and the split of common chimpanzees into two distinct groups: Nigeria-Cameroon/western and central/eastern populations. We find extensive inbreeding in almost all wild populations, with eastern gorillas being the most extreme. Inferred effective population sizes have varied radically over time in different lineages and this appears to have a profound effect on the genetic diversity at, or close to, genes in almost all species. We discover and assign 1,982 loss-of-function variants throughout the human and great ape lineages, determining that the rate of gene loss has not been different in the human branch compared to other internal branches in the great ape phylogeny. This comprehensive catalogue of great ape genome diversity provides a framework for understanding evolution and a resource for more effective management of wild and captive great ape populations.","Prado-Martinez, Javier;

113,111,35.0,"DNA repair by homologous recombination(1) is highly suppressed in G1 cells(2,3) to ensure that mitotic recombination occurs solely between sister chromatids(4). Although many homologous recombination factors are cell-cycle regulated, the identity of the events that are both necessary and sufficient to suppress recombination in G1 cells is unknown. Here we report that the cell cycle controls the interaction of BRCA1 with PALB2-BRCA2 to constrain BRCA2 function to the S/G2 phases in human cells. We found that the BRCA1-interaction site on PALB2 is targeted by an E3 ubiquitin ligase composed of KEAP1, a PALB2-interacting protein(5), in complex with cullin-3 (CUL3)-RBX1 (ref.6). PALB2 ubiquitylation suppresses its interaction with BRCA1 and is counteracted by the deubiquitylase USP11, which is itself under cell cycle control. Restoration of the BRCA1-PALB2 interaction combined with the activation of DNA-end resection is sufficient to induce homologous recombination in G1, as measured by RAD51 recruitment, unscheduled DNA synthesis and a CRISPR-Cas9-based gene-targeting assay. We conclude that the mechanism prohibiting homologous recombination in G1 minimally consists of the suppression of DNA-end resection coupled with a multi-step block of the recruitment of BRCA2 to DNA damage sites that involves the inhibition of BRCA1-PALB2-BRCA2 complex assembly. We speculate that the ability to induce homologous recombination in G1 cells with defined factors could spur the development of gene-targeting applications in non-dividing cells.","Orthwein, Alexandre; Noordermeer, Sylvie M.; Wilson, Marcus D.; Landry, Sebastien; Enchev, Radoslav I.; Sherker, Alana; Munro, Meagan; Pinder, Jordan; Salsman, Jayme; Dellaire, Graham; Xia, Bing; Peter, Matthias; Durocher, Daniel","Orthwein, A; Noordermeer, SM; Wilson, MD; Landry, S; Enchev, RI; Sherker, A; Munro, M; Pinder, J; Salsman, J; Dellaire, G; Xia, B; Peter, M; Durocher, D",422.0,"[Orthwein, Alexandre; Noordermeer, Sylvie M.; Wilson, Marcus D.; Landry, Sebastien; Sherker, Alana; Munro, Meagan; Durocher, Daniel] Mt Sinai Hosp, Lunenfeld Tanenbaum Res Inst, Toronto, ON M5G 1X5, Canada; [Enchev, Radoslav I.; Peter, Matthias] ETH, Inst Biochem, Dept Biol, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Sherker, Alana; Durocher, Daniel] Univ Toronto, Dept Mol Genet, Toronto, ON M5S 3E1, Canada; [Pinder, Jordan; Salsman, Jayme; Dellaire, Graham] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Pathol, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada; [Pinder, Jordan; Salsman, Jayme; Dellaire, Graham] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada; [Xia, Bing] Rutgers State Univ, Rutgers Canc Inst New Jersey, Dept Radiat Oncol, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Xia, Bing] Rutgers State Univ, Robert Wood Johnson Med Sch, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature16142,Article,1476-4687,durocher@lunenfeld.ca,+,"Dutch Cancer Society (KWF); Human Frontier Science Program fellowship; Ontario Graduate Scholarship; Marie Curie postdoctoral fellowship; Beatrice Hunter Cancer Research Institute (BHCRI); Harvey Graham Cancer Research Fund as part of the Terry Fox Foundation Strategic Health Research Training Program in Cancer Research at the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); Krembil Foundation; CIHR [FDN143343, MOP84260]","We are grateful to R.

114,174,235.0,"Accurate segregation of the replicated genome requires chromosome biorientation on the spindle. Biorientation is ensured by Aurora B kinase (Ipl1), a member of the four-subunit chromosomal passenger complex (CPC)(1,2). Localization of the CPC to the inner centromere is central to the current model for how tension ensures chromosome biorientation: kinetochore-spindle attachments that are not under tension remain close to the inner centromere and are destabilized by Aurora B phosphorylation, whereas kinetochores under tension are pulled away from the influence of Aurora B, stabilizing their microtubule attachments(3-5). Here we show that an engineered truncation of the Sli15 (known as INCENP in humans) subunit of budding yeast CPC that eliminates association with the inner centromere nevertheless supports proper chromosome segregation during both mitosis and meiosis. Truncated Sli15 suppresses the deletion phenotypes of the innercentromere-targeting proteins survivin (Bir1), borealin (Nbl1), Bub1 and Sgo1 (ref. 6). Unlike wild-type Sli15, truncated Sli15 localizes to pre-anaphase spindle microtubules. Premature targeting of full-length Sli15 to microtubules by preventing Cdk1 (also known as Cdc28) phosphorylation also suppresses the inviability of Bir1 deletion. These results suggest that activation of Aurora B kinase by clustering either on chromatin or on microtubules is sufficient for chromosome biorientation.","Campbell, Christopher S.; Desai, Arshad","Campbell, CS; Desai, A",118.0,"[Campbell, Christopher S.; Desai, Arshad] Univ Calif San Diego, Ludwig Inst Canc Res, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Campbell, Christopher S.; Desai, Arshad] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Cellular & Mol Med, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12057,Article,,abdesai@ucsd.edu,+,National Institutes of Health (NIH) [GM074215]; Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation Fellowship [DRG 2007-09]; Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research,"The authors would like to thank the Desai and Oegema laboratories for discussions; S.

115,134,355.0,"Nucleus accumbens neurons serve to integrate information from cortical and limbic regions to direct behaviour. Addictive drugs are proposed to hijack this system, enabling drug-associated cues to trigger relapse to drug seeking. However, the connections affected and proof of causality remain to be established. Here we use a mouse model of delayed cue-associated cocaine seeking with ex vivo electrophysiology in optogenetically delineated circuits. We find that seeking correlates with rectifying AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) receptor transmission and a reduced AMPA/NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) ratio at medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to nucleus accumbens shell D1-receptor medium-sized spiny neurons (D1R-MSNs). In contrast, the AMPA/NMDA ratio increases at ventral hippocampus to D1R-MSNs. Optogenetic reversal of cocaine-evoked plasticity at both inputs abolishes seeking, whereas selective reversal at mPFC or ventral hippocampus synapses impairs response discrimination or reduces response vigour during seeking, respectively. Taken together, we describe how information integration in the nucleus accumbens is commandeered by cocaine at discrete synapses to allow relapse. Our approach holds promise for identifying synaptic causalities in other behavioural disorders.","Pascoli, Vincent; Terrier, Jean; Espallergues, Julie; Valjent, Emmanuel; O'Connor, Eoin Cornelius; Luescher, Christian","Pascoli, V; Terrier, J; Espallergues, J; Valjent, E; O'Connor, EC; Luscher, C",459.0,"[Pascoli, Vincent; Terrier, Jean; O'Connor, Eoin Cornelius; Luescher, Christian] Univ Geneva, Fac Med, Dept Basic Neurosci, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Espallergues, Julie; Valjent, Emmanuel] CNRS, INSERM, U661, F-34094 Montpellier, France; [Espallergues, Julie; Valjent, Emmanuel] CNRS, Inst Genom Fonct, UMR 5203, F-34094 Montpellier, France; [Espallergues, Julie; Valjent, Emmanuel] Univ Montpellier I, UMR 5203, F-34094 Montpellier, France; [Espallergues, Julie; Valjent, Emmanuel] Univ Montpellier 2, UMR 5203, F-34094 Montpellier, France; [Luescher, Christian] Univ Hosp Geneva, Dept Clin Neurosci, Clin Neurol, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13257,Article,1476-4687,christian.luscher@unige.ch,+,Swiss National Science Foundation; National Center of Competence in Research (NCCR) 'SYNAPSY - The Synaptic Bases of Mental Diseases' of the Swiss National Science Foundation; European Research Council advanced grant (MeSSI); MD-PhD grant of the Swiss Confederation; Avenir grant (Inserm); Agence Nationale de la Recherche,"We thank D.

116,23,79.0,"In termination of protein synthesis, the bacterial release factors RF1 and RF2 bind to the ribosome through specific recognition of messenger RNA stop codons and trigger hydrolysis of the bond between the nascent polypeptide and the transfer RNA at the peptidyl-tRNA site, thereby releasing the newly synthesized protein. The release factors are highly specific for a U in the first stop-codon position 1 and recognize different combinations of purines in the second and third positions, with RF1 reading UAA and UAG and RF2 reading UAA and UGA. With recently determined crystal structures of termination complexes(2-4), it has become possible to decipher the energetics of stop-codon reading by computational analysis and to clarify the origin of the high release-factor binding accuracy. Here we report molecular dynamics free-energy calculations on different cognate and non-cognate termination complexes. The simulations quantitatively explain the basic principles of decoding in all three codon positions and reveal the key elements responsible for specificity of the release factors. The overall reading mechanism involves hitherto unidentified interactions and recognition switches that cannot be described in terms of a tripeptide anticodon model. Further simulations of complexes with tRNA(Trp), the tRNA recognizing the triplet codon for Trp, explain the observation of a 'leaky' stop codon 5 and highlight the fundamentally different third position reading by RF2, which leads to a high stop-codon specificity with strong discrimination against the Trp codon. The simulations clearly illustrate the versatility of codon reading by protein, which goes far beyond tRNA mimicry.","Sund, Johan; Ander, Martin; Aqvist, Johan","Sund, J; Ander, M; Aqvist, J",947.0,"[Sund, Johan; Ander, Martin; Aqvist, Johan] Uppsala Univ, Biomed Ctr, Dept Cell & Mol Biol, SE-75124 Uppsala, Sweden",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09082,Article,,aqvist@xray.bmc.uu.se,U12,Swedish Research Council,"Support from the Swedish Research Council is gratefully acknowledged.

117,48,353.0,"One defining goal of synthetic biology is the development of engineering- based approaches that enable the construction of gene- regulatory networks according to 'design specifications' generated from computational modelling(1-6). This approach provides a systematic framework for exploring how a given regulatory network generates a particular phenotypic behaviour. Several fundamental gene circuits have been developed using this approach, including toggle switches(7) and oscillators(8-10), and these have been applied in new contexts such as triggered biofilm development(11) and cellular population control(12). Here we describe an engineered genetic oscillator in Escherichia coli that is fast, robust and persistent, with tunable oscillatory periods as fast as 13 min. The oscillator was designed using a previously modelled network architecture comprising linked positive and negative feedback loops(1,13). Using a microfluidic platform tailored for single- cell microscopy, we precisely control environmental conditions and monitor oscillations in individual cells through multiple cycles. Experiments reveal remarkable robustness and persistence of oscillations in the designed circuit; almost every cell exhibited large- amplitude fluorescence oscillations throughout observation runs. The oscillatory period can be tuned by altering inducer levels, temperature and the media source. Computational modelling demonstrates that the key design principle for constructing a robust oscillator is a time delay in the negative feedback loop, which can mechanistically arise from the cascade of cellular processes involved in forming a functional transcription factor. The positive feedback loop increases the robustness of the oscillations and allows for greater tunability.

118,61,226.0,"Recent data from several organisms indicate that the transcribed portions of genomes are larger and more complex than expected, and that many functional properties of transcripts are based not on coding sequences but on regulatory sequences in untranslated regions or non- coding RNAs(1-9). Alternative start and polyadenylation sites and regulation of intron splicing add additional dimensions to the rich transcriptional output(10,11). This transcriptional complexity has been sampled mainly using hybridization- based methods under one or few experimental conditions. Here we applied direct high- throughput sequencing of complementary DNAs ( RNA- Seq), supplemented with data from high- density tiling arrays, to globally sample transcripts of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, independently from available gene annotations. We interrogated transcriptomes under multiple conditions, including rapid proliferation, meiotic differentiation and environmental stress, as well as in RNA processing mutants to reveal the dynamic plasticity of the transcriptional landscape as a function of environmental, developmental and genetic factors. High- throughput sequencing proved to be a powerful and quantitative method to sample transcriptomes deeply at maximal resolution. In contrast to hybridization, sequencing showed little, if any, background noise and was sensitive enough to detect widespread transcription in >90% of the genome, including traces of RNAs that were not robustly transcribed or rapidly degraded. The combined sequencing and strand- specific array data provide rich condition- specific information on novel, mostly non- coding transcripts, untranslated regions and gene structures, thus improving the existing genome annotation. Sequence reads spanning exon-exon or exon - intron junctions give unique insight into a surprising variability in splicing efficiency across introns, genes and conditions. Splicing efficiency was largely coordinated with transcript levels, and increased transcription led to increased splicing in test genes. Hundreds of introns showed such regulated splicing during cellular proliferation or differentiation.","Wilhelm, Brian T.; Marguerat, Samuel; Watt, Stephen; Schubert, Falk; Wood, Valerie; Goodhead, Ian; Penkett, Christopher J.; Rogers, Jane; Bahler, Jurg","Wilhelm, BT; Marguerat, S; Watt, S; Schubert, F; Wood, V; Goodhead, I; Penkett, CJ; Rogers, J; Bahler, J",1239.0,"[Wilhelm, Brian T.; Marguerat, Samuel; Watt, Stephen; Schubert, Falk; Wood, Valerie; Goodhead, Ian; Penkett, Christopher J.; Rogers, Jane; Bahler, Jurg] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Canc Res UK Fiss Yeast Funct Genom Grp, Cambridge CB10 1HH, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07002,Article,,jurg@sanger.ac.uk,U39,"Cancer Research UK [A6517, C9546/A6517]; Wellcome Trust [, 077118]",,318FA,Y,N,GENOME-WIDE TRANSCRIPTION; FISSION YEAST; GENE-EXPRESSION; SCHIZOSACCHAROMYCES-POMBE; TILING ARRAYS; RNA; MEIOSIS; IDENTIFICATION; MICROARRAYS; TELOMERASE,7199.0,NATURE,Nature,English,31.0,No,"Goodhead, Ian/0000-0002-3110-9442; Wood, Valerie/0000-0001-6330-7526; Bahler, Jurg/0000-0003-4036-1532","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",26-Jun,7.0,LONDON,18488015.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,"; Bahler, Jurg/B-4572-2009","Bahler, J (reprint author), UCL, Dept Genet Evolut & Environm, Mortimer St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,613.0,Dynamic repertoire of a eukaryotic transcriptome surveyed at single-nucleotide resolution,3.0,101.0,WOS:000257075800043,226.0,453,Multidisciplinary Sciences,657,jurg,bahler,13941.0,1,male,1.0,UVpqD2IAAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
119,193,365.0,"Despite the broad conceptual and applied relevance of how the number of species or endemics changes with area (the species-area and endemics-area relationships (SAR and EAR)), our understanding of universality and pervasiveness of these patterns across taxa and regions has remained limited. The SAR has traditionally been approximated by a power law(1), but recent theories predict a triphasic SAR in logarithmic space, characterized by steeper increases in species richness at both small and large spatial scales(2-6). Here we uncover such universally upward accelerating SARs for amphibians, birds and mammals across the world's major landmasses. Although apparently taxon-specific and continent-specific, all curves collapse into one universal function after the area is rescaled by using the mean range sizes of taxa within continents. In addition, all EARs approximately follow a power law with a slope close to 1, indicating that for most spatial scales there is roughly proportional species extinction with area loss. These patterns can be predicted by a simulation model based on the random placement of contiguous ranges within a domain. The universality of SARs and EARs after rescaling implies that both total and endemic species richness within an area, and also their rate of change with area, can be estimated by using only the knowledge of mean geographic range size in the region and mean species richness at one spatial scale.","Storch, David; Keil, Petr; Jetz, Walter","Storch, D; Keil, P; Jetz, W",78.0,"[Storch, David] Charles Univ Prague, Ctr Theoret Study, Prague 11000 1, Czech Republic; [Storch, David] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Prague 11000 1, Czech Republic; [Storch, David] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Ecol, CR-12844 Prague 2, Czech Republic; [Keil, Petr; Jetz, Walter] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11226,Article,1476-4687,storch@cts.cuni.cz,+,"Grant Agency of the Czech Republic [P505/11/2387]; Czech Ministry of Education [MSM0021620845]; EU FP7 SCALES project [26852]; National Science Foundation [DBI 0960550, DEB 1026764]; NASA Biodiversity Program [NNX11AP72G]","We thank J.

120,214,490.0,"Technological advances in DNA recovery and sequencing have drastically expanded the scope of genetic analyses of ancient specimens to the extent that full genomic investigations are now feasible and are quickly becoming standard(1). This trend has important implications for infectious disease research because genomic data from ancient microbes may help to elucidate mechanisms of pathogen evolution and adaptation for emerging and re-emerging infections. Here we report a reconstructed ancient genome of Yersinia pestis at 30-fold average coverage from Black Death victims securely dated to episodes of pestilence-associated mortality in London, England, 1348-1350. Genetic architecture and phylogenetic analysis indicate that the ancient organismis ancestral to most extant strains and sits very close to the ancestral node of all Y. pestis commonly associated with human infection. Temporal estimates suggest that the Black Death of 1347-1351 was the main historical event responsible for the introduction and widespread dissemination of the ancestor to all currently circulating Y. pestis strains pathogenic to humans, and further indicates that contemporary Y. pestis epidemics have their origins in the medieval era. Comparisons against modern genomes reveal no unique derived positions in the medieval organism, indicating that the perceived increased virulence of the disease during the Black Death may not have been due to bacterial phenotype. These findings support the notion that factors other than microbial genetics, such as environment, vector dynamics and host susceptibility, should be at the forefront of epidemiological discussions regarding emerging Y. pestis infections.","Bos, Kirsten I.; Schuenemann, Verena J.; Golding, G.

121,13,264.0,"Bacteria and Archaea have developed several defence strategies against foreign nucleic acids such as viral genomes and plasmids. Among them, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) loci together with cas (CRISPR-associated) genes form the CRISPR/Cas immune system, which involves partially palindromic repeats separated by short stretches of DNA called spacers, acquired from extrachromosomal elements. It was recently demonstrated that these variable loci can incorporate spacers from infecting bacteriophages and then provide immunity against subsequent bacteriophage infections in a sequence-specific manner. Here we show that the Streptococcus thermophilus CRISPR1/Cas system can also naturally acquire spacers from a self-replicating plasmid containing an antibiotic-resistance gene, leading to plasmid loss. Acquired spacers that match antibiotic-resistance genes provide a novel means to naturally select bacteria that cannot uptake and disseminate such genes. We also provide in vivo evidence that the CRISPR1/Cas system specifically cleaves plasmid and bacteriophage double-stranded DNA within the proto-spacer, at specific sites. Our data show that the CRISPR/Cas immune system is remarkably adapted to cleave invading DNA rapidly and has the potential for exploitation to generate safer microbial strains.","Garneau, Josiane E.; Dupuis, Marie-Eve; Villion, Manuela; Romero, Dennis A.; Barrangou, Rodolphe; Boyaval, Patrick; Fremaux, Christophe; Horvath, Philippe; Magadan, Alfonso H.; Moineau, Sylvain","Garneau, JE; Dupuis, ME; Villion, M; Romero, DA; Barrangou, R; Boyaval, P; Fremaux, C; Horvath, P; Magadan, AH; Moineau, S",67.0,"[Garneau, Josiane E.; Dupuis, Marie-Eve; Villion, Manuela; Magadan, Alfonso H.; Moineau, Sylvain] Univ Laval, Felix dHerelle Reference Ctr Bacterial Viruses, Dept Biochim Microbiol & Bioinformat, Fac Med Dent,Grp Rech Ecol Buccale,Fac Sci & Geni, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Romero, Dennis A.; Barrangou, Rodolphe] Danisco USA Inc, Madison, WI 53716 USA; [Boyaval, Patrick; Fremaux, Christophe; Horvath, Philippe] Danisco France SAS, F-86220 Dange St Romain, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09523,Article,,Sylvain.Moineau@bcm.ulaval.ca,+,Novalait/FQRNT; Clarin/FICYT; NSERC; CIHR,"We thank T.R.

122,396,363.0,"Human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) are a promising source of cells for applications in regenerative medicine. Directed differentiation of PSCs into specialized cells such as spinal motoneurons(1) or midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons(2) has been achieved. However, the effective use of PSCs for cell therapy has lagged behind. Whereas mouse PSC-derived DA neurons have shown efficacy in models of Parkinson's disease(3,4), DA neurons from human PSCs generally show poor in vivo performance(5). There are also considerable safety concerns for PSCs related to their potential for teratoma formation or neural overgrowth(6,7). Here we present a novel floor-plate-based strategy for the derivation of human DA neurons that efficiently engraft in vivo, suggesting that past failures were due to incomplete specification rather than a specific vulnerability of the cells. Midbrain floor-plate precursors are derived from PSCs 11 days after exposure to small molecule activators of sonic hedgehog (SHH) and canonical WNT signalling. Engraftable midbrain DA neurons are obtained by day 25 and can be maintained in vitro for several months. Extensive molecular profiling, biochemical and electrophysiological data define developmental progression and confirm identity of PSC-derived midbrain DA neurons. In vivo survival and function is demonstrated in Parkinson's disease models using three host species. Long-term engraftment in 6-hydroxy-dopamine-lesioned mice and rats demonstrates robust survival of midbrain DA neurons derived from human embryonic stem (ES) cells, complete restoration of amphetamine-induced rotation behaviour and improvements in tests of forelimb use and akinesia. Finally, scalability is demonstrated by transplantation into parkinsonian monkeys. Excellent DA neuron survival, function and lack of neural overgrowth in the three animal models indicate promise for the development of cell-based therapies in Parkinson's disease.","Kriks, Sonja; Shim, Jae-Won; Piao, Jinghua; Ganat, Yosif M.; Wakeman, Dustin R.; Xie, Zhong; Carrillo-Reid, Luis; Auyeung, Gordon; Antonacci, Chris; Buch, Amanda; Yang, Lichuan; Beal, M.

123,136,385.0,"Sequencing DNA from several organisms has revealed that duplication and drift of existing genes have primarily moulded the contents of a given genome. Though the effect of knocking out or overexpressing a particular gene has been studied in many organisms, no study has systematically explored the effect of adding new links in a biological network. To explore network evolvability, we constructed 598 recombinations of promoters ( including regulatory regions) with different transcription or sigma-factor genes in Escherichia coli, added over a wild- type genetic background. Here we show that similar to 95% of new networks are tolerated by the bacteria, that very few alter growth, and that expression level correlates with factor position in the wild- type network hierarchy. Most importantly, we find that certain networks consistently survive over the wild type under various selection pressures. Therefore new links in the network are rarely a barrier for evolution and can even confer a fitness advantage.","Isalan, Mark; Lemerle, Caroline; Michalodimitrakis, Konstantinos; Horn, Carsten; Beltrao, Pedro; Raineri, Emanuele; Garriga-Canut, Mireia; Serrano, Luis","Isalan, M; Lemerle, C; Michalodimitrakis, K; Horn, C; Beltrao, P; Raineri, E; Garriga-Canut, M; Serrano, L",840.0,"[Isalan, Mark; Michalodimitrakis, Konstantinos; Raineri, Emanuele; Garriga-Canut, Mireia; Serrano, Luis] UPF, CRG, EMBL, CRG Syst Biol, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Lemerle, Caroline; Horn, Carsten; Beltrao, Pedro] European Mol Biol Lab, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06847,Article,1476-4687,isalan@crg.es,U2,Wellcome Trust [066543],,288ZY,,,ESCHERICHIA-COLI K-12; TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATORY NETWORKS; OPERON ORGANIZATION; BIOFILM FORMATION; EXPRESSION; GROWTH; TOLERANCE; EVOLUTION; RPOS; TYPHIMURIUM,7189.0,NATURE,Nature,English,45.0,No,"Serrano, Luis/0000-0002-5276-1392; Beltrao, Pedro/0000-0002-2724-7703","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",17-Apr,7.0,LONDON,18421347.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,"Beltrao, Pedro/B-3342-2010; Serrano, Luis/B-3355-2013","Isalan, M (reprint author), UPF, CRG, EMBL, CRG Syst Biol, Barcelona 08003, Spain.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,186.0,Evolvability and hierarchy in rewired bacterial gene networks,1.0,32.0,WOS:000255026000041,385.0,452,Multidisciplinary Sciences,192,luis,serrano,50682.0,4053,male,1.0,D1EHFZQAAAAJ,5,"(17929, ]",36036328,1,372766,1,Ángel Luis Fernández Serrano,Ángel Luis Fernández Serrano,1,1
124,40,156.0,"Interactions lie at the heart of correlated many-body quantum phases(1-3). Typically, the interactions between microscopic particles are described as two-body interactions. However, it has been shown that higher-order multi-body interactions could give rise to novel quantum phases with intriguing properties. So far, multi-body interactions have been observed as inelastic loss resonances in three-and four-body recombinations of atom-atom and atom-molecule collisions(4-6). Here we demonstrate the presence of effective multi-body interactions(7) in a system of ultracold bosonic atoms in a three-dimensional optical lattice, emerging through virtual transitions of particles from the lowest energy band to higher energy bands. We observe such interactions up to the six-body case in time-resolved traces of quantum phase revivals(8-11), using an atom interferometric technique that allows us to precisely measure the absolute energies of atom number states at a lattice site. In addition, we show that the spectral content of these time traces can reveal the atom number statistics at a lattice site, similar to foundational experiments in cavity quantum electrodynamics that yield the statistics of a cavity photon field(12). Our precision measurement of multi-body interaction energies provides crucial input for the comparison of optical-lattice quantum simulators with many-body quantum theory.","Will, Sebastian; Best, Thorsten; Schneider, Ulrich; Hackermueller, Lucia; Luehmann, Dirk-Soeren; Bloch, Immanuel","Will, S; Best, T; Schneider, U; Hackermuller, L; Luhmann, DS; Bloch, I",197.0,"[Will, Sebastian; Best, Thorsten; Schneider, Ulrich; Hackermueller, Lucia; Bloch, Immanuel] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Phys, D-55099 Mainz, Germany; [Will, Sebastian; Schneider, Ulrich; Bloch, Immanuel] Univ Munich, Fac Phys, D-80799 Munich, Germany; [Luehmann, Dirk-Soeren] Univ Hamburg, Inst Theoret Phys, D-20355 Hamburg, Germany; [Bloch, Immanuel] Max Planck Inst Quantum Opt, D-85748 Garching, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09036,Article,,sebastian.will@lmu.de,201,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; European Union, EuroQUAM; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency; US Air Force Office of Scientific Research, MATCOR; Gutenberg Akademie","This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, the European Union (Integrated Project SCALA), EuroQUAM (L.

125,370,457.0,"The elucidation of breast cancer subgroups and their molecular drivers requires integrated views of the genome and transcriptome from representative numbers of patients. We present an integrated analysis of copy number and gene expression in a discovery and validation set of 997 and 995 primary breast tumours, respectively, with long-term clinical follow-up. Inherited variants (copy number variants and single nucleotide polymorphisms) and acquired somatic copy number aberrations (CNAs) were associated with expression in similar to 40% of genes, with the landscape dominated by cis-and trans-acting CNAs. By delineating expression outlier genes driven in cis by CNAs, we identified putative cancer genes, including deletions in PPP2R2A, MTAP and MAP2K4. Unsupervised analysis of paired DNA-RNA profiles revealed novel subgroups with distinct clinical outcomes, which reproduced in the validation cohort. These include a high-risk, oestrogen-receptor-positive 11q13/14 cis-acting subgroup and a favourable prognosis subgroup devoid of CNAs. Trans-acting aberration hotspots were found to modulate subgroup-specific gene networks, including a TCR deletion-mediated adaptive immune response in the 'CNA-devoid' subgroup and a basal-specific chromosome 5 deletion-associated mitotic network. Our results provide a novel molecular stratification of the breast cancer population, derived from the impact of somatic CNAs on the transcriptome.","Curtis, Christina; Shah, Sohrab P.; Chin, Suet-Feung; Turashvili, Gulisa; Rueda, Oscar M.; Dunning, Mark J.; Speed, Doug; Lynch, Andy G.; Samarajiwa, Shamith; Yuan, Yinyin; Graef, Stefan; Ha, Gavin; Haffari, Gholamreza; Bashashati, Ali; Russell, Roslin; McKinney, Steven; Langerod, Anita; Green, Andrew; Provenzano, Elena; Wishart, Gordon; Pinder, Sarah; Watson, Peter; Markowetz, Florian; Murphy, Leigh; Ellis, Ian; Purushotham, Arnie; Borresen-Dale, Anne-Lise; Brenton, James D.; Tavare, Simon; Caldas, Carlos; Aparicio, Samuel","Curtis, C; Shah, SP; Chin, SF; Turashvili, G; Rueda, OM; Dunning, MJ; Speed, D; Lynch, AG; Samarajiwa, S; Yuan, YY; Graf, S; Ha, G; Haffari, G; Bashashati, A; Russell, R; McKinney, S; Langerod, A; Green, A; Provenzano, E; Wishart, G; Pinder, S; Watson, P; Markowetz, F; Murphy, L; Ellis, I; Purushotham, A; Borresen-Dale, AL; Brenton, JD; Tavare, S; Caldas, C; Aparicio, S",346.0,"[Curtis, Christina; Chin, Suet-Feung; Rueda, Oscar M.; Lynch, Andy G.; Samarajiwa, Shamith; Yuan, Yinyin; Graef, Stefan; Markowetz, Florian; Tavare, Simon; Caldas, Carlos] Univ Cambridge, Dept Oncol, Cambridge CB2 2XZ, England; [Curtis, Christina; Chin, Suet-Feung; Rueda, Oscar M.; Dunning, Mark J.; Speed, Doug; Lynch, Andy G.; Samarajiwa, Shamith; Yuan, Yinyin; Graef, Stefan; Russell, Roslin; Markowetz, Florian; Brenton, James D.; Tavare, Simon; Caldas, Carlos] Canc Res UK, Cambridge Res Inst, Li Ka Shing Ctr, Cambridge CB2 0RE, England; [Shah, Sohrab P.; Turashvili, Gulisa; Ha, Gavin; Haffari, Gholamreza; Bashashati, Ali; McKinney, Steven; Watson, Peter; Aparicio, Samuel] Univ British Columbia, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Vancouver, BC V6T 2B5, Canada; [Shah, Sohrab P.; Turashvili, Gulisa; McKinney, Steven; Watson, Peter; Aparicio, Samuel] British Columbia Canc Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada; [Speed, Doug; Tavare, Simon] Univ Cambridge, Dept Appl Math & Theoret Phys, Ctr Math Sci, Cambridge CB3 0WA, England; [Langerod, Anita; Borresen-Dale, Anne-Lise] Radiumhosp, Dept Genet, Inst Canc Res, Oslo Univ Hosp, N-0310 Oslo, Norway; [Green, Andrew; Ellis, Ian] Univ Nottingham, Dept Histopathol, Sch Mol Med Sci, Nottingham NG5 1PB, England; [Provenzano, Elena; Wishart, Gordon; Caldas, Carlos] Cambridge Univ Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Cambridge Breast Unit, Addenbrookes Hosp, Cambridge CB2 2QQ, England; [Pinder, Sarah; Purushotham, Arnie] Kings Coll London, Breakthrough Breast Canc Res Unit, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Pinder, Sarah; Borresen-Dale, Anne-Lise] NIHR Cambridge Biomed Res Ctr, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Watson, Peter; Murphy, Leigh] Univ Manitoba, Manitoba Inst Cell Biol, Winnipeg, MB R3E 0V9, Canada; [Purushotham, Arnie] Guys & St Thomas NHS Fdn Trust, NIHR Comprehens Biomed Res Ctr, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Borresen-Dale, Anne-Lise] Univ Oslo, Inst Clin Med, Fac Med, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Brenton, James D.; Caldas, Carlos] Cambridge Expt Canc Med Ctr, Cambridge CB2 0RE, England; [Tavare, Simon] Univ So Calif, Mol & Computat Biol Program, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",METABRIC Grp,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10983,Article,,carlos.caldas@cancer.org.uk; saparicio@bccrc.ca,352,Cancer Research UK; British Columbia Cancer Foundation; Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation BC/Yukon; University of Cambridge; Hutchinson Whampoa; NIHR Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre; Cambridge Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre; Centre for Translational Genomics (CTAG) Vancouver; BCCA Breast Cancer Outcomes Unit; Canada Research Chair; National Institutes of Health Centers of Excellence in Genomics Science [P50 HG02790],"The METABRIC project was funded by Cancer Research UK, the British Columbia Cancer Foundation and Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation BC/Yukon.

126,255,308.0,"Targeted genome editing by artificial nucleases has brought the goal of site-specific transgene integration and gene correction within the reach of gene therapy. However, its application to long-term repopulating haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) has remained elusive. Here we show that poor permissiveness to gene transfer and limited proficiency of the homology-directed DNA repair pathway constrain gene targeting in human HSCs. By tailoring delivery platforms and culture conditions we overcame these barriers and provide stringent evidence of targeted integration in human HSCs by long-term multilineage repopulation of transplanted mice. We demonstrate the therapeutic potential of our strategy by targeting a corrective complementary DNA into the IL2RG gene of HSCs from healthy donors and a subject with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID-X1). Gene-edited HSCs sustained normal haematopoiesis and gave rise to functional lymphoid cells that possess a selective growth advantage over those carrying disruptive IL2RG mutations. These results open up new avenues for treating SCID-X1 and other diseases.","Genovese, Pietro; Schiroli, Giulia; Escobar, Giulia; Di Tomaso, Tiziano; Firrito, Claudia; Calabria, Andrea; Moi, Davide; Mazzieri, Roberta; Bonini, Chiara; Holmes, Michael C.; Gregory, Philip D.; van der Burg, Mirjam; Gentner, Bernhard; Montini, Eugenio; Lombardo, Angelo; Naldini, Luigi","Genovese, P; Schiroli, G; Escobar, G; Di Tomaso, T; Firrito, C; Calabria, A; Moi, D; Mazzieri, R; Bonini, C; Holmes, MC; Gregory, PD; van der Burg, M; Gentner, B; Montini, E; Lombardo, A; Naldini, L",235.0,"[Genovese, Pietro; Schiroli, Giulia; Escobar, Giulia; Di Tomaso, Tiziano; Firrito, Claudia; Calabria, Andrea; Moi, Davide; Mazzieri, Roberta; Gentner, Bernhard; Montini, Eugenio; Lombardo, Angelo; Naldini, Luigi] Ist Sci San Raffaele, San Raffaele Telethon Inst Gene Therapy, TIGET, I-20132 Milan, Italy; [Schiroli, Giulia; Escobar, Giulia; Gentner, Bernhard; Lombardo, Angelo; Naldini, Luigi] Univ Vita Salute San Raffaele, I-20132 Milan, Italy; [Bonini, Chiara] Ist Sci San Raffaele, Expt Hematol Unit, I-20132 Milan, Italy; [Holmes, Michael C.; Gregory, Philip D.] Sangamo BioSci Inc, Richmond, CA 94804 USA; [van der Burg, Mirjam] Univ Med Ctr, Erasmus MC, Dept Immunol, NL-3015 Rotterdam, Netherlands",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13420,Article,1476-4687,naldini.luigi@hsr.it,+,Telethon (TIGET grant) [D2]; EU [249845]; Italian Ministry of Health,"We thank D.

127,393,312.0,"Tipping points, at which complex systems can shift abruptly from one state to another, are notoriously difficult to predict(1). Theory proposes that early warning signals may be based on the phenomenon that recovery rates from small perturbations should tend to zero when approaching a tipping point(2,3); however, evidence that this happens in living systems is lacking. Here we test such 'critical slowing down' using a microcosmin which photo-inhibition drives a cyanobacterial population to a classical tipping point when a critical light level is exceeded. We show that over a large range of conditions, recovery from small perturbations becomes slower as the system comes closer to the critical point. In addition, autocorrelation in the subtle fluctuations of the system's state rose towards the tipping point, supporting the idea that this metric can be used as an indirect indicator of slowing down(4,5). Although stochasticity prohibits prediction of the timing of critical transitions, our results suggest that indicators of slowing down may be used to rank complex systems on a broad scale from resilient to fragile.","Veraart, Annelies J.; Faassen, Elisabeth J.; Dakos, Vasilis; van Nes, Egbert H.; Lurling, Miquel; Scheffer, Marten","Veraart, AJ; Faassen, EJ; Dakos, V; van Nes, EH; Lurling, M; Scheffer, M",357.0,"[Veraart, Annelies J.; Faassen, Elisabeth J.; Dakos, Vasilis; van Nes, Egbert H.; Lurling, Miquel; Scheffer, Marten] Wageningen Univ, Dept Aquat Ecol & Water Qual Management, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Lurling, Miquel] Royal Netherlands Acad Arts & Sci, Netherlands Inst Ecol, Dept Aquat Ecol, NL-6700 AB Wageningen, Netherlands",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10723,Article,,egbert.vannes@wur.nl,U137,European Research Council; Spinoza award,"We thank M.

128,277,89.0,"Simulations of structure formation in the Universe predict that galaxies are embedded in a 'cosmic web'(1), where most baryons reside as rarefied and highly ionized gas(2). This material has been studied for decades in absorption against background sources(3), but the sparseness of these inherently one-dimensional probes preclude direct constraints on the three-dimensional morphology of the underlying web. Here we report observations of a cosmic web filament in Lyman-alpha emission, discovered during a survey for cosmic gas fluorescently illuminated by bright quasars(4,5) at redshift z approximate to 2.3. With a linear projected size of approximately 460 physical kiloparsecs, the Lyman-alpha emission surrounding the radio-quiet quasar UM287 extends well beyond the virial radius of any plausible associated dark-matter halo and therefore traces intergalactic gas. The estimated cold gas mass of the filament from the observed emission-about 10(12.0 +/- 0.5)/C-1/2 solar masses, where C is the gas clumping factor-is more than ten times larger than what is typically found in cosmological simulations(5,6), suggesting that a population of intergalactic gas clumps with subkiloparsec sizes may be missing in current numerical models.","Cantalupo, Sebastiano; Arrigoni-Battaia, Fabrizio; Prochaska, J.

129,279,153.0,"Galaxies observed at redshift z>6, when the Universe was less than a billion years old, thus far very rarely show evidence(1-3) of the cold dust that accompanies star formation in the local Universe, where the dust-to-gas mass ratio is around one per cent. A prototypical example is the galaxy Himiko (z = 6.6), which-a mere 840 million years after the Big Bang-is forming stars at a rate of 30-100 solar masses per year, yielding a mass assembly time of about 150 x 10(6) years. Himiko is thought to have a low fraction (2-3 per cent of the Sun's) of elements heavier than helium (low metallicity), and although its gas mass cannot yet be determined its dust-to-stellar mass ratio is constrained(3) to be less than 0.05 per cent. The local dwarf galaxy I Zwicky 18, which has a metallicity about 4 per cent that of the Sun's(4) and is forming stars less rapidly (assembly time about 1.6 x 10(9) years) than Himiko but still vigorously for its mass(5), is also very dust deficient and is perhaps one of the best analogues of primitive galaxies accessible to detailed study. Here we report observations of dust emission from I Zw 18, from which we determine its dust mass to be 450-1,800 solar masses, yielding a dust-to-stellar mass ratio of about 10(-6) to 10(-5) and a dust-to-gas mass ratio of 3.2-13 x 10(-6). If I Zw 18 is a reasonable analogue of Himiko, then Himiko's dust mass must be around 50,000 solar masses, a factor of 100 below the current upper limit. These numbers are quite uncertain, but if most high-z galaxies are more like Himiko than like the very-high-dust-mass galaxy SDSS J114816.64 + 525150.3 at z approximate to 6, which hosts a quasar(6), then our prospects for detecting the gas and dust inside such galaxies are much poorer than hitherto anticipated.","Fisher, David B.; Bolatto, Alberto D.; Herrera-Camus, Rodrigo; Draine, Bruce T.; Donaldson, Jessica; Walter, Fabian; Sandstrom, Karin M.; Leroy, Adam K.; Cannon, John; Gordon, Karl","Fisher, DB; Bolatto, AD; Herrera-Camus, R; Draine, BT; Donaldson, J; Walter, F; Sandstrom, KM; Leroy, AK; Cannon, J; Gordon, K",186.0,"[Fisher, David B.; Bolatto, Alberto D.; Herrera-Camus, Rodrigo; Donaldson, Jessica] Univ Maryland, Dept Astron, Lab Millimeter Wave Astron, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Fisher, David B.; Bolatto, Alberto D.; Herrera-Camus, Rodrigo; Donaldson, Jessica] Univ Maryland, Joint Space Inst, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Fisher, David B.] Swinburne Univ Technol, Ctr Astrophys & Supercomp, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia; [Draine, Bruce T.] Princeton Univ, Dept Astrophys Sci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Walter, Fabian; Sandstrom, Karin M.] Max Planck Inst Astron, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Leroy, Adam K.] Natl Radio Astron Observ, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Cannon, John] Macalester Coll, Dept Phys & Astron, St Paul, MN 55105 USA; [Gordon, Karl] Space Telescope Sci Inst, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12765,Article,1476-4687,dfisher@swin.edu.au; bolatto@astro.umd.edu,189,"University of Maryland; Laboratory for Millimeter Astronomy; NSF [AST0838178, AST1008570, AST1211683]; CAREER NSF [AST0955836, AST1139998]; Research Corporation for Science Advancement Cottrell Scholar award; Marie Curie International Incoming fellowship; BMVIT (Austria); ESA-PRODEX (Belgium); CEA/CNES (France); DLR (Germany); ASI/INAF (Italy); CICYT/MCYT (Spain)","D.B.F., A.

130,106,317.0,"A central question in ecology with great importance for management, conservation and biological control is how changing connectivity affects the persistence and dynamics of interacting species. Researchers in many disciplines have used large systems of coupled oscillators to model the behaviour of a diverse array of fluctuating systems in nature(1-4). In the well- studied regime of weak coupling, synchronization is favoured by increases in coupling strength and large- scale network structures ( for example 'small worlds') that produce short cuts and clustering(5-9). Here we show that, by contrast, randomizing the structure of dispersal networks in a model of predators and prey tends to favour asynchrony and prolonged transient dynamics, with resulting effects on the amplitudes of population fluctuations. Our results focus on synchronization and dynamics of clusters in models, and on time-scales, more appropriate for ecology, namely smaller systems with strong interactions outside the weak- coupling regime, rather than the better- studied cases of large, weakly coupled systems. In these smaller systems, the dynamics of transients and the effects of changes in connectivity can be well understood using a set of methods including numerical reconstructions of phase dynamics, examinations of cluster formation and the consideration of important aspects of cyclic dynamics, such as amplitude.","Holland, Matthew D.; Hastings, Alan","Holland, MD; Hastings, A",792.0,"[Holland, Matthew D.; Hastings, Alan] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07395,Article,,mdholland@ucdavis.edu,U76,Quantitative Environmental and Integrative Biology; National Science Foundation,We thank M.

131,422,271.0,"More than half of the world's population now lives in cities, making the creation of a healthy urban environment amajor policy priority(1). Cities have both health risks and benefits(1), but mental health is negatively affected: mood and anxiety disorders are more prevalent in city dwellers(2) and the incidence of schizophrenia is strongly increased in people born and raised in cities(3-6). Although these findings have been widely attributed to the urban social environment(2,3,7,8), the neural processes that could mediate such associations are unknown. Here we show, using functional magnetic resonance imaging in three independent experiments, that urban upbringing and city living have dissociable impacts on social evaluative stress processing in humans. Current city living was associated with increased amygdala activity, whereas urban upbringing affected the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex, a key region for regulation of amygdala activity, negative affect(9) and stress(10). These findings were regionally and behaviourally specific, as no other brain structures were affected and no urbanicity effect was seen during control experiments invoking cognitive processing without stress. Our results identify distinct neural mechanisms for an established environmental risk factor, link the urban environment for the first time to social stress processing, suggest that brain regions differ in vulnerability to this risk factor across the lifespan, and indicate that experimental interrogation of epidemiological associations is a promising strategy in social neuroscience.","Lederbogen, Florian; Kirsch, Peter; Haddad, Leila; Streit, Fabian; Tost, Heike; Schuch, Philipp; Wuest, Stefan; Pruessner, Jens C.; Rietschel, Marcella; Deuschle, Michael; Meyer-Lindenberg, Andreas","Lederbogen, F; Kirsch, P; Haddad, L; Streit, F; Tost, H; Schuch, P; Wust, S; Pruessner, JC; Rietschel, M; Deuschle, M; Meyer-Lindenberg, A",498.0,"[Lederbogen, Florian; Kirsch, Peter; Haddad, Leila; Streit, Fabian; Tost, Heike; Schuch, Philipp; Wuest, Stefan; Rietschel, Marcella; Deuschle, Michael; Meyer-Lindenberg, Andreas] Univ Heidelberg, Cent Inst Mental Hlth, Fac Med, D-68159 Mannheim, Germany; [Pruessner, Jens C.] McGill Univ, Douglas Mental Hlth Univ Inst, Verdun, PQ H4H 1R3, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10190,Article,,a.meyer-lindenberg@zi-mannheim.de,501,European Community [HEALTH-F2-2010-241909]; German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) [SFB 636-B7]; Federal Ministry of Education and Research (MooDS),"We thank D.

132,4,59.0,"The anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C) is an unusually large E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for regulating defined cell cycle transitions. Information on how its 13 constituent proteins are assembled, and how they interact with co-activators, substrates and regulatory proteins is limited. Here, we describe a recombinant expression system that allows the reconstitution of holo APC/C and its sub-complexes that, when combined with electron microscopy, mass spectrometry and docking of crystallographic and homology-derived coordinates, provides a precise definition of the organization and structure of all essential APC/C subunits, resulting in a pseudo-atomic model for 70% of the APC/C. A lattice-like appearance of the APC/C is generated by multiple repeat motifs of most APC/C subunits. Three conserved tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) subunits (Cdc16, Cdc23 and Cdc27) share related superhelical homo-dimeric architectures that assemble to generate a quasi-symmetrical structure. Our structure explains how this TPR sub-complex, together with additional scaffolding subunits (Apc1, Apc4 and Apc5), coordinate the juxtaposition of the catalytic and substrate recognition module (Apc2, Apc11 and Apc10 (also known as Doc1)), and TPR-phosphorylation sites, relative to co-activator, regulatory proteins and substrates.","Schreiber, Anne; Stengel, Florian; Zhang, Ziguo; Enchev, Radoslav I.; Kong, Eric H.; Morris, Edward P.; Robinson, Carol V.; da Fonseca, Paula C.

133,382,104.0,"DNA methylation is highly dynamic during mammalian embryogenesis. It is broadly accepted that the paternal genome is actively depleted of 5-methylcytosine at fertilization, followed by passive loss that reaches a minimum at the blastocyst stage. However, this model is based on limited data, and so far no base-resolution maps exist to support and refine it. Here we generate genome-scale DNA methylation maps in mouse gametes and from the zygote through post-implantation. We find that the oocyte already exhibits global hypomethylation, particularly at specific families of long interspersed element 1 and long terminal repeat retroelements, which are disparately methylated between gametes and have lower methylation values in the zygote than in sperm. Surprisingly, the oocyte contributes a unique set of differentially methylated regions (DMRs)-including many CpG island promoters-that are maintained in the early embryo but are lost upon specification and absent from somatic cells. In contrast, sperm-contributed DMRs are largely intergenic and become hypermethylated after the blastocyst stage. Our data provide a genome-scale, base-resolution timeline of DNA methylation in the pre-specified embryo, when this epigenetic modification is most dynamic, before returning to the canonical somatic pattern.","Smith, Zachary D.; Chan, Michelle M.; Mikkelsen, Tarjei S.; Gu, Hongcang; Gnirke, Andreas; Regev, Aviv; Meissner, Alexander","Smith, ZD; Chan, MM; Mikkelsen, TS; Gu, HC; Gnirke, A; Regev, A; Meissner, A",339.0,"[Smith, Zachary D.; Chan, Michelle M.; Mikkelsen, Tarjei S.; Gu, Hongcang; Gnirke, Andreas; Regev, Aviv; Meissner, Alexander] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Smith, Zachary D.; Mikkelsen, Tarjei S.; Meissner, Alexander] Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Smith, Zachary D.; Meissner, Alexander] Harvard Univ, Dept Stem Cell & Regenerat Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Chan, Michelle M.] MIT, Computat & Syst Biol Program, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Regev, Aviv] MIT, Dept Biol, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10960,Article,1476-4687,alexander_meissner@harvard.edu,U74,"NIH [5DP1OD003958, 5RC1AA019317, U01ES017155, P01GM099117]; HHMI; Harvard Stem Cell Institute; Massachusetts Life Science Center; Pew Charitable Trusts; Center for Excellence in Genome Science from the NHGRI [1P50HG006193-01]; Burroughs Wellcome Career Award at the Scientific Interface","We would like to thank all members of the Meissner and Regev laboratories.

134,236,44.0,"The response of the terrestrial carbon cycle to climate change is among the largest uncertainties affecting future climate change projections(1,2). The feedback between the terrestrial carbon cycle and climate is partly determined by changes in the turnover time of carbon in land ecosystems, which in turn is an ecosystem property that emerges from the interplay between climate, soil and vegetation type(3-6). Here we present a global, spatially explicit and observation-based assessment of whole-ecosystem carbon turnover times that combines new estimates of vegetation and soil organic carbon stocks and fluxes. We find that the overall mean global carbon turnover time is 23(4)(+7) years (95 per cent confidence interval). Onaverage, carbon resides in the vegetation and soil near the Equator for a shorter time than at latitudes north of 75 degrees north (mean turnover times of 15 and 255 years, respectively). We identify a clear dependence of the turnover time on temperature, as expected from our present understanding of temperature controls on ecosystem dynamics. Surprisingly, our analysis also reveals a similarly strong association between turnover time and precipitation. Moreover, we find that the ecosystem carbon turnover times simulated by state-of-the-art coupled climate/carbon-cycle models vary widely and that numerical simulations, on average, tend to underestimate the global carbon turnover time by 36 per cent. The models show stronger spatial relationships with temperature than do observation-based estimates, but generally do not reproduce the strong relationships with precipitation and predict faster carbon turnover in many semiarid regions. Our findings suggest that future climate/carbon-cycle feedbacks may depend more strongly on changes in the hydrological cycle than is expected at present and is considered in Earth system models.","Carvalhais, Nuno; Forkel, Matthias; Khomik, Myroslava; Bellarby, Jessica; Jung, Martin; Migliavacca, Mirco; Mu, Mingquan; Saatchi, Sassan; Santoro, Maurizio; Thurner, Martin; Weber, Ulrich; Ahrens, Bernhard; Beer, Christian; Cescatti, Alessandro; Randerson, James T.; Reichstein, Markus","Carvalhais, N; Forkel, M; Khomik, M; Bellarby, J; Jung, M; Migliavacca, M; Mu, MQ; Saatchi, S; Santoro, M; Thurner, M; Weber, U; Ahrens, B; Beer, C; Cescatti, A; Randerson, JT; Reichstein, M",213.0,"[Carvalhais, Nuno; Forkel, Matthias; Khomik, Myroslava; Jung, Martin; Migliavacca, Mirco; Thurner, Martin; Weber, Ulrich; Ahrens, Bernhard; Beer, Christian; Reichstein, Markus] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Carvalhais, Nuno] Univ Nova Lisboa, FCT, DCEA, P-2829516 Caparica, Portugal; [Khomik, Myroslava] McMaster Univ, Sch Geog & Earth Sci, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada; [Bellarby, Jessica] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, Aberdeen AB24 3UU, Scotland; [Bellarby, Jessica] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England; [Migliavacca, Mirco] Univ Milano Bicocca, DISAT, Remote Sensing Environm Dynam Lab, I-20126 Milan, Italy; [Mu, Mingquan; Randerson, James T.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Saatchi, Sassan] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA; [Santoro, Maurizio] Gamma Remote Sensing, CH-3073 Gumlingen, Switzerland; [Beer, Christian] Stockholm Univ, Dept Appl Environm Sci, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Beer, Christian] Stockholm Univ, Bolin Ctr Climate Res, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Cescatti, Alessandro] Commiss European Communities, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Climate Risk Management Unit, I-21027 Ispra, Italy",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13731,Article,1476-4687,nuno.carvalhais@bgc-jena.mpg.de,+,European Union (FP7) through the project GEOCARBON [283080]; ERC starting grant QUASOM [ERC-2007-StG-208516]; European Union (FP7) through the project CARBONES [242316]; European Union (FP7) through the project EMBRACE [283201],"We would like to thank C.

136,295,434.0,"Application of a specific stimulus opens the intracellular gate of a K+ channel (activation), yielding a transient period of ion conduction until the selectivity filter spontaneously undergoes a conformational change towards a non-conductive state (inactivation). Removal of the stimulus closes the gate and allows the selectivity filter to interconvert back to its conductive conformation (recovery). Given that the structural differences between the conductive and inactivated filter are very small, it is unclear why the recovery process can take up to several seconds. The bacterial K+ channel KcsA from Streptomyces lividans can be used to help elucidate questions about channel inactivation and recovery at the atomic level. Although KcsA contains only a pore domain, without voltage-sensing machinery, it has the structural elements necessary for ion conduction, activation and inactivation(1-7). Here we reveal, by means of a series of long molecular dynamics simulations, how the selectivity filter is sterically locked in the inactive conformation by buried water molecules bound behind the selectivity filter. Potential of mean force calculations show how the recovery process is affected by the buried water molecules and the rebinding of an external K+ ion. A kinetic model deduced from the simulations shows how releasing the buried water molecules can stretch the timescale of recovery to seconds. This leads to the prediction that reducing the occupancy of the buried water molecules by imposing a high osmotic stress should accelerate the rate of recovery, which was verified experimentally by measuring the recovery rate in the presence of a 2-molar sucrose concentration.","Ostmeyer, Jared; Chakrapani, Sudha; Pan, Albert C.; Perozo, Eduardo; Roux, Benoit","Ostmeyer, J; Chakrapani, S; Pan, AC; Perozo, E; Roux, B",,"[Ostmeyer, Jared; Pan, Albert C.; Perozo, Eduardo; Roux, Benoit] Univ Chicago, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Chakrapani, Sudha] Case Western Reserve Univ, Sch Med, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12395,Article,1476-4687,roux@uchicago.edu,,"National Institute of Health [R01-GM062342, R01-GM57846]; Office of Science of the Department of Energy [DE-AC05-00OR22725]; Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC) through National Institutes of Health [RC2GM093307]","This work was supported by the National Institute of Health through grant R01-GM062342 (J.O. and B.

137,9,163.0,"The multi-component mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) kinase is the central node of a mammalian pathway that coordinates cell growth with the availability of nutrients, energy and growth factors(1). Progress has been made in the identification of mTORC1 pathway components and in understanding their functions in cells, but there is relatively little known about the role of the pathway in vivo. Specifically, we have little knowledge regarding the role mTOCR1 has in liver physiology. In fasted animals, the liver performs numerous functions that maintain whole-body homeostasis, including the production of ketone bodies for peripheral tissues to use as energy sources. Here we show that mTORC1 controls ketogenesis in mice in response to fasting. We find that liver-specific loss of TSC1 (tuberous sclerosis 1), an mTORC1 inhibitor(1), leads to a fasting-resistant increase in liver size, and to a pronounced defect in ketone body production and ketogenic gene expression on fasting. The loss of raptor (regulatory associated protein of mTOR, complex 1) an essential mTORC1 component(1), has the opposite effects. In addition, we find that the inhibition of mTORC1 is required for the fasting-induced activation of PPAR alpha (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha), the master transcriptional activator of ketogenic genes(2), and that suppression of NCoR1 (nuclear receptor co-repressor 1), a co-repressor of PPAR alpha(3), reactivates ketogenesis in cells and livers with hyperactive mTORC1 signalling. Like livers with activated mTORC1, livers from aged mice have a defect in ketogenesis(4,5), which correlates with an increase in mTORC1 signalling. Moreover, we show that the suppressive effects of mTORC1 activation and ageing on PPAR alpha activity and ketone production are not additive, and that mTORC1 inhibition is sufficient to prevent the ageing-induced defect in ketogenesis. Thus, our findings reveal that mTORC1 is a key regulator of PPAR alpha function and hepatic ketogenesis and suggest a role for mTORC1 activity in promoting the ageing of the liver.","Sengupta, Shomit; Peterson, Timothy R.; Laplante, Mathieu; Oh, Stephanie; Sabatini, David M.","Sengupta, S; Peterson, TR; Laplante, M; Oh, S; Sabatini, DM",1100.0,"[Sengupta, Shomit; Peterson, Timothy R.; Laplante, Mathieu; Oh, Stephanie; Sabatini, David M.] Nine Cambridge Ctr, Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Sengupta, Shomit; Peterson, Timothy R.; Laplante, Mathieu; Oh, Stephanie; Sabatini, David M.] MIT, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Sengupta, Shomit; Peterson, Timothy R.; Laplante, Mathieu; Oh, Stephanie; Sabatini, David M.] MIT, David H Koch Inst Integrat Canc Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09584,Article,,sabatini@wi.mit.edu,U502,"American Diabetes Association; Ludwig Cancer Fund; Canadian Institutes of Health Research; NIH [CA103866, CA129105]","We thank S.

138,328,475.0,"Long-term potentiation (LTP), a well-characterized form of synaptic plasticity, has long been postulated as a cellular correlate of learning and memory. Although LTP can persist for long periods of time(1), the mechanisms underlying LTP maintenance, in the midst of ongoing protein turnover and synaptic activity, remain elusive. Sustained activation of the brain-specific protein kinase C (PKC) isoform protein kinase M-zeta (PKM-zeta) has been reported to be necessary for both LTP maintenance and long-term memory(2). Inhibiting PKM-zeta activity using a synthetic zeta inhibitory peptide (ZIP) based on the PKC-zeta pseudosubstrate sequence reverses established LTP in vitro and in vivo(3,4). More notably, infusion of ZIP eliminates memories for a growing list of experience-dependent behaviours, including active place avoidance(4), conditioned taste aversion(5), fear conditioning and spatial learning(6). However, most of the evidence supporting a role for PKM-zeta in LTP and memory relies heavily on pharmacological inhibition of PKM-zeta by ZIP. To further investigate the involvement of PKM-zeta in the maintenance of LTP and memory, we generated transgenic mice lacking PKC-zeta and PKM-zeta. We find that both conventional and conditional PKC zeta/PKM-zeta knockout mice show normal synaptic transmission and LTP at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses, and have no deficits in several hippocampal-dependent learning and memory tasks. Notably, ZIP still reverses LTP in PKC-zeta/PKM-zeta knockout mice, indicating that the effects of ZIP are independent of PKM-zeta.","Volk, Lenora J.; Bachman, Julia L.; Johnson, Richard; Yu, Yilin; Huganir, Richard L.","Volk, LJ; Bachman, JL; Johnson, R; Yu, YL; Huganir, RL",420.0,"[Volk, Lenora J.; Bachman, Julia L.; Johnson, Richard; Yu, Yilin; Huganir, Richard L.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Neurosci, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11802,Article,,rhuganir@jhmi.edu,U169,"National Institute of Health [NS36715, T32MH15330]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute","We thank G.

139,24,392.0,"If not properly processed and repaired, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) can give rise to deleterious chromosome rearrangements, which could ultimately lead to the tumour phenotype(1,2). DSB ends are resected in a 5' to 3' fashion in cells, to yield single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) for the recruitment of factors critical for DNA damage checkpoint activation and repair by homologous recombination 2. The resection process involves redundant pathways consisting of nucleases, DNA helicases and associated proteins(3). Being guided by recent genetic studies(4-6), we have reconstituted the first eukaryotic ATP-dependent DNA end-resection machinery comprising the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 (MRX) complex, the Sgs1-Top3-Rmi1 complex, Dna2 protein and the heterotrimeric ssDNA-binding protein RPA. Here we show that DNA strand separation during end resection is mediated by the Sgs1 helicase function, in a manner that is enhanced by Top3-Rmi1 and MRX. In congruence with genetic observations(6), although the Dna2 nuclease activity is critical for resection, the Mre11 nuclease activity is dispensable. By examining the top3 Y356F allele and its encoded protein, we provide evidence that the topoisomerase activity of Top3, although critical for the suppression of crossover recombination(2,7), is not needed for resection either in cells or in the reconstituted system. Our results also unveil a multifaceted role of RPA, in the sequestration of ssDNA generated by DNA unwinding, enhancement of 5' strand incision, and protection of the 3' strand. Our reconstituted system should serve as a useful model for delineating the mechanistic intricacy of the DNA break resection process in eukaryotes.","Niu, Hengyao; Chung, Woo-Hyun; Zhu, Zhu; Kwon, Youngho; Zhao, Weixing; Chi, Peter; Prakash, Rohit; Seong, Changhyun; Liu, Dongqing; Lu, Lucy; Ira, Grzegorz; Sung, Patrick","Niu, HY; Chung, WH; Zhu, Z; Kwon, Y; Zhao, WX; Chi, P; Prakash, R; Seong, CH; Liu, DQ; Lu, L; Ira, G; Sung, P",108.0,"[Chung, Woo-Hyun; Zhu, Zhu; Ira, Grzegorz] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Human Genet, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Niu, Hengyao; Kwon, Youngho; Zhao, Weixing; Chi, Peter; Prakash, Rohit; Seong, Changhyun; Liu, Dongqing; Lu, Lucy; Sung, Patrick] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol Biophys & Biochem, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09318,Article,,gira@bcm.edu; patrick.sung@yale.edu,U143,US National Institutes of Health; Susan G.

Calorie restriction acts by reducing mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signalling in Paneth cells, and the ISC-enhancing effects of calorie restriction can be mimicked by rapamycin. Calorie intake regulates mTORC1 in Paneth cells, but not ISCs, and forced activation of mTORC1 in Paneth cells during calorie restriction abolishes the ISC-augmenting effects of the niche. Finally, increased expression of bone stromal antigen 1 (Bst1) in Paneth cells-an ectoenzyme that produces the paracrine factor cyclic ADP ribose-mediates the effects of calorie restriction and rapamycin on ISC function. Our findings establish that mTORC1 non-cell-autonomously regulates stem-cell self-renewal, and highlight a significant role of the mammalian intestinal niche in coupling stem-cell function to organismal physiology.","Yilmaz, Oemer H.; Katajisto, Pekka; Lamming, Dudley W.; Gueltekin, Yetis; Bauer-Rowe, Khristian E.; Sengupta, Shomit; Birsoy, Kivanc; Dursun, Abdulmetin; Yilmaz, V.

141,196,246.0,"Social norms and the associated altruistic behaviours are decisive for the evolution of human cooperation(1-9) and the maintenance of social order(10), and they affect family life, politics(11) and economic interactions(12). However, as altruistic norm compliance and norm enforcement often emerge in the context of inter-group conflicts(13,14), they are likely to be shaped by parochialism(15) - a preference for favouring the members of one's ethnic, racial or language group. We have conducted punishment experiments(16), which allow 'impartial' observers to punish norm violators, with indigenous groups in Papua New Guinea. Here we show that these experiments confirm the prediction of parochialism. We found that punishers protect ingroup victims - who suffer from a norm violation - much more than they do outgroup victims, regardless of the norm violator's group affiliation. Norm violators also expect that punishers will be lenient if the latter belong to their social group. As a consequence, norm violations occur more often if the punisher and the norm violator belong to the same group. Our results are puzzling for evolutionary multi-level selection theories based on selective group extinction(2-5) as well as for theories of individual selection(17-19); they also indicate the need to explicitly examine the interactions between individuals stemming from different groups in evolutionary models.","Bernhard, Helen; Fischbacher, Urs; Fehr, Ernst","Bernhard, H; Fischbacher, U; Fehr, E",912.0,"Univ Zurich, Inst Empir Res Econ, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; Coll Helveticum, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature04981,Article,,fiba@iew.unizh.ch; efehr@iew.unizh.ch,915,,,076LT,,,INDIRECT RECIPROCITY; SOCIAL NORMS; EVOLUTION; PUNISHMENT; ENFORCEMENT; BEHAVIOR,7105.0,NATURE,Nature,English,33.0,No,"Fischbacher, Urs/0000-0002-5115-8815","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",24-Aug,4.0,LONDON,16929297.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,"Fischbacher, Urs/H-2693-2014","Fehr, E (reprint author), Univ Zurich, Inst Empir Res Econ, Blumlisalpstr 10, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,230.0,Parochial altruism in humans,3.0,91.0,WOS:000239960500036,246.0,442,Multidisciplinary Sciences,234,ernst,fehr,84418.0,25,male,1.0,WoSILroAAAAJ,5,"(17929, ]",4329785,1,1805135,1,Ernst Fehr,Ernst Fehr,1,1

143,28,462.0,"The superposition of quantum states drives motion on the atomic and subatomic scales, with the energy spacing of the states dictating the speed of the motion. In the case of electrons residing in the outer (valence) shells of atoms and molecules which are separated by electronvolt energies, this means that valence electron motion occurs on a subfemtosecond to few-femtosecond timescale (1 fs = 10(-15) s). In the absence of complete measurements, the motion can be characterized in terms of a complex quantity, the density matrix. Here we report an attosecond pump-probe measurement of the density matrix of valence electrons in atomic krypton ions(1). We generate the ions with a controlled few-cycle laser field(2) and then probe them through the spectrally resolved absorption of an attosecond extreme-ultraviolet pulse(3), which allows us to observe in real time the subfemtosecond motion of valence electrons over a multifemtosecond time span. We are able to completely characterize the quantum mechanical electron motion and determine its degree of coherence in the specimen of the ensemble. Although the present study uses a simple, prototypical open system, attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy should be applicable to molecules and solid-state materials to reveal the elementary electron motions that control physical, chemical and biological properties and processes.","Goulielmakis, Eleftherios; Loh, Zhi-Heng; Wirth, Adrian; Santra, Robin; Rohringer, Nina; Yakovlev, Vladislav S.; Zherebtsov, Sergey; Pfeifer, Thomas; Azzeer, Abdallah M.; Kling, Matthias F.; Leone, Stephen R.; Krausz, Ferenc","Goulielmakis, E; Loh, ZH; Wirth, A; Santra, R; Rohringer, N; Yakovlev, VS; Zherebtsov, S; Pfeifer, T; Azzeer, AM; Kling, MF; Leone, SR; Krausz, F",739.0,"[Goulielmakis, Eleftherios; Wirth, Adrian; Yakovlev, Vladislav S.; Zherebtsov, Sergey; Kling, Matthias F.; Krausz, Ferenc] Max Planck Inst Quantum Opt, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Loh, Zhi-Heng; Pfeifer, Thomas; Leone, Stephen R.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Loh, Zhi-Heng; Pfeifer, Thomas; Leone, Stephen R.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Loh, Zhi-Heng; Pfeifer, Thomas; Leone, Stephen R.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Div Chem Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Santra, Robin] Argonne Natl Lab, Argonne, IL 60439 USA; [Santra, Robin] Univ Chicago, Dept Phys, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Rohringer, Nina] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Livermore, CA 94551 USA; [Yakovlev, Vladislav S.; Krausz, Ferenc] Univ Munich, Dept Phys, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Azzeer, Abdallah M.] King Saud Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09212,Article,,elgo@mpq.mpg.de; srl@berkeley.edu; krausz@lmu.de,U7,"Max Planck Society; King Saud University; DFG Cluster of Excellence: Munich Centre for Advanced Photonics; Marie-Curie Reintegration grant [MERG-CT-2007-208643]; DFG; Air Force Office of Scientific Research [FA9550-04-1-0242]; National Science Foundation [CHE-0742662, EEC-0310717]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, DE-AC02-06CH11357]; MPG; US Department of Energy, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory [DE-AC52-07NA27344]","We thank U.

144,85,51.0,"Injury or impaired clearance of apoptotic cells leads to the pathological accumulation of necrotic corpses, which induce an inflammatory response that initiates tissue repair(1). In addition, antigens present in necrotic cells can sometimes provoke a specific immune response(2-4) and it has been argued that necrosis could explain adaptive immunity in seemingly infection-free situations, such as after allograft transplantation or in spontaneous and therapy-induced tumour rejection(5,6). In the mouse, the CD8 alpha(+) subset of dendritic cells phagocytoses dead cell remnants and cross-primes CD8(+) T cells against cell-associated antigens(7). Here we show that CD8 alpha(+) dendritic cells use CLEC9A (also known as DNGR-1), a recently-characterized C-type lectin(8-10), to recognize a preformed signal that is exposed on necrotic cells. Loss or blockade of CLEC9A does not impair the uptake of necrotic cell material by CD8 alpha(+) dendritic cells, but specifically reduces cross-presentation of dead-cell-associated antigens in vitro and decreases the immunogenicity of necrotic cells in vivo. The function of CLEC9A requires a key tyrosine residue in its intracellular tail that allows the recruitment and activation of the tyrosine kinase SYK, which is also essential for cross-presentation of dead-cell-associated antigens. Thus, CLEC9A functions as a SYK-coupled C-type lectin receptor to mediate sensing of necrosis by the principal dendritic-cell subset involved in regulating cross-priming to cell-associated antigens.","Sancho, David; Joffre, Olivier P.; Keller, Anna M.; Rogers, Neil C.; Martinez, Dolores; Hernanz-Falcon, Patricia; Rosewell, Ian; Reis e Sousa, Caetano","Sancho, D; Joffre, OP; Keller, AM; Rogers, NC; Martinez, D; Hernanz-Falcon, P; Rosewell, I; Sousa, CRE",899.0,"[Sancho, David; Joffre, Olivier P.; Keller, Anna M.; Rogers, Neil C.; Hernanz-Falcon, Patricia; Reis e Sousa, Caetano] Lincolns Inn Fields Labs, Immunobiol Lab, London WC2A 3PX, England; [Sancho, David; Joffre, Olivier P.; Keller, Anna M.; Rogers, Neil C.; Hernanz-Falcon, Patricia; Reis e Sousa, Caetano] Lincolns Inn Fields Labs, London Res Inst, Canc Res UK, FACS Lab, London WC2A 3PX, England; [Martinez, Dolores; Rosewell, Ian] Imperial Canc Res Fund, Clare Hall Labs, Canc Res UK, Trangen Serv, Potters Bar EN6 3LD, Herts, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07750,Article,,caetano@cancer.org.uk,903,Cancer Research UK; EMBO [ALTF 336-2004]; European Community [MEIF-CT-2005-009205],"This work was funded by Cancer Research UK.

145,158,141.0,"NUMB is a cell fate determinant, which, by asymmetrically partitioning at mitosis, controls cell fate choices by antagonising the activity of the plasma membrane receptor of the NOTCH family(1). NUMB is also an endocytic protein(2), and the NOTCH-NUMB counteraction has been linked to this function(3,4). There might be, however, additional functions of NUMB, as witnessed by its proposed role as a tumour suppressor in breast cancer(5). Here we describe a previously unknown function for human NUMB as a regulator of tumour protein p53 ( also known as TP53). NUMB enters in a tricomplex with p53 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase HDM2( also known as MDM2), thereby preventing ubiquitination and degradation of p53. This results in increased p53 protein levels and activity, and in regulation of p53- dependent phenotypes. In breast cancers there is frequent loss of NUMB expression(5). We show that, in primary breast tumour cells, this event causes decreased p53 levels and increased chemoresistance. In breast cancers, loss of NUMB expression causes increased activity of the receptor NOTCH5. Thus, in these cancers, a single event - loss of NUMB expression - determines activation of an oncogene ( NOTCH) and attenuation of the p53 tumour suppressor pathway. Biologically, this results in an aggressive tumour phenotype, as witnessed by findings that NUMB- defective breast tumours display poor prognosis. Our results uncover a previously unknown tumour suppressor circuitry.","Colaluca, Ivan N.; Tosoni, Daniela; Nuciforo, Paolo; Senic-Matuglia, Francesca; Galimberti, Viviana; Viale, Giuseppe; Pece, Salvatore; Di Fiore, Pier Paolo","Colaluca, IN; Tosoni, D; Nuciforo, P; Senic-Matuglia, F; Galimberti, V; Viale, G; Pece, S; Di Fiore, PP",76.0,"[Colaluca, Ivan N.; Tosoni, Daniela; Nuciforo, Paolo; Senic-Matuglia, Francesca; Pece, Salvatore; Di Fiore, Pier Paolo] FIRC Inst Mol Oncol Fdn, IFOM, I-20139 Milan, Italy; [Colaluca, Ivan N.; Tosoni, Daniela; Galimberti, Viviana; Viale, Giuseppe; Pece, Salvatore; Di Fiore, Pier Paolo] European Inst Oncol, I-20141 Milan, Italy; [Viale, Giuseppe; Pece, Salvatore; Di Fiore, Pier Paolo] Univ Milan, Dipartimento Med Chirurg & Odontoiatria, I-20122 Milan, Italy",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06412,Article,,salvatore.pece@ifom-ieo-campus.it; pierpaolo.difiore@ifom-ieo-campus.it,U11,Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro,,247KZ,,,ASYMMETRIC CELL-DIVISION; BREAST-CANCER; NEGATIVE REGULATION; ENDOCYTIC PROTEIN; ALPHA-ADAPTIN; HISTONE H2AX; STEM-CELLS; MDM2; EXPRESSION; GENE,7174.0,NATURE,Nature,English,32.0,No,"Pece, Salvatore/0000-0003-1764-3929; Di Fiore, Pier Paolo/0000-0002-2252-0950; Nuciforo, Paolo/0000-0003-1380-0990","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",3-Jan,6.0,LONDON,18172499.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,"Pece, Salvatore/B-9609-2013; Tosoni, Daniela/K-4524-2014; Di Fiore, Pier Paolo/K-2130-2012","Pece, S (reprint author), FIRC Inst Mol Oncol Fdn, IFOM, Via Adamello 16, I-20139 Milan, Italy.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,211.0,NUMB controls p53 tumour suppressor activity,0.0,22.0,WOS:000252079300037,141.0,451,Multidisciplinary Sciences,239,pier paolo,di fiore,31841.0,3,male,1.0,Gm7qnecAAAAJ,5,"(17929, ]",220884,1,168255,1,Florence Cathedral,Florence Cathedral,0,0
146,171,226.0,"With the emergence of multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria, it is imperative to develop new intervention strategies. Current antibiotics typically target pathogen rather than host-specific biochemical pathways(1). Here we have developed kinase inhibitors that prevent intracellular growth of unrelated pathogens such as Salmonella typhimurium and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. An RNA interference screen of the human kinome using automated microscopy revealed several host kinases capable of inhibiting intracellular growth of S. typhimurium. The kinases identified clustered in one network around AKT1 (also known as PKB). Inhibitors of AKT1 prevent intracellular growth of various bacteria including MDR-M. tuberculosis. AKT1 is activated by the S. typhimurium effector SopB, which promotes intracellular survival by controlling actin dynamics through PAK4, and phagosome-lysosome fusion through the AS160 (also known as TBC1D4)-RAB14 pathway. AKT1 inhibitors counteract the bacterial manipulation of host signalling processes, thus controlling intracellular growth of bacteria. By using a reciprocal chemical genetics approach, we identified kinase inhibitors with antibiotic properties and their host targets, and we determined host signalling networks that are activated by intracellular bacteria for survival.","Kuijl, Coenraad; Savage, Nigel D.

147,149,25.0,"Cohesin complexes mediate sister- chromatid cohesion in dividing cells but may also contribute to gene regulation in postmitotic cells. How cohesin regulates gene expression is not known. Here we describe cohesin- binding sites in the human genome and show that most of these are associated with the CCCTC- binding factor ( CTCF), a zinc- finger protein required for transcriptional insulation. CTCF is dispensable for cohesin loading onto DNA, but is needed to enrich cohesin at specific binding sites. Cohesin enables CTCF to insulate promoters from distant enhancers and controls transcription at the H19/IGF2 ( insulin- like growth factor 2) locus. This role of cohesin seems to be independent of its role in cohesion. We propose that cohesin functions as a transcriptional insulator, and speculate that subtle deficiencies in this function contribute to 'cohesinopathies' such as Cornelia de Lange syndrome.","Wendt, Kerstin S.; Yoshida, Keisuke; Itoh, Takehiko; Bando, Masashige; Koch, Birgit; Schirghuber, Erika; Tsutsumi, Shuichi; Nagae, Genta; Ishihara, Ko; Mishiro, Tsuyoshi; Yahata, Kazuhide; Imamoto, Fumio; Aburatani, Hiroyuki; Nakao, Mitsuyoshi; Imamoto, Naoko; Maeshima, Kazuhiro; Shirahige, Katsuhiko; Peters, Jan-Michael","Wendt, KS; Yoshida, K; Itoh, T; Bando, M; Koch, B; Schirghuber, E; Tsutsumi, S; Nagae, G; Ishihara, K; Mishiro, T; Yahata, K; Imamoto, F; Aburatani, H; Nakao, M; Imamoto, N; Maeshima, K; Shirahige, K; Peters, JM",796.0,"[Yoshida, Keisuke; Bando, Masashige; Shirahige, Katsuhiko] Tokyo Inst Technol, Grad Sch Biosci & Biotechnol, Midori Ku, Kanagawa 2268501, Japan; [Wendt, Kerstin S.; Koch, Birgit; Schirghuber, Erika; Peters, Jan-Michael] Res Inst Mol Pathol, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Itoh, Takehiko] Mitsubishi Res Inst Inc, Adv Sci & Technol Res Ctr, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1008141, Japan; [Tsutsumi, Shuichi; Aburatani, Hiroyuki] Univ Tokyo, Genome Sci Div, Adv Sci & Technol Res Ctr, Tokyo 1538904, Japan; [Yahata, Kazuhide; Imamoto, Fumio] Osaka Univ, Dept Mol Biol, Res Inst Microbial Dis, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Ishihara, Ko; Mishiro, Tsuyoshi; Nakao, Mitsuyoshi] Kumamoto Univ, Dept Regenerat Med, Inst Mol Embryol & Genet, Kumamoto 8600811, Japan; [Imamoto, Naoko; Maeshima, Kazuhiro] RIKEN, Cellular Dynam Lab, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06634,Article,,kshirahi@bio.titech.ac.jp; peters@imp.univie.ac.at,U3,Austrian Science Fund FWF [F 3407],,263BA,Y,N,SISTER-CHROMATID COHESION; DE-LANGE-SYNDROME; ENHANCER-BLOCKING ACTIVITY; HUMAN GENOME; NIPPED-B; CTCF-BINDING; SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE; DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER; ROBERTS-SYNDROME; GENE-EXPRESSION,7180.0,NATURE,Nature,English,55.0,No,"Itoh, Takehiko/0000-0002-6113-557X; Imamoto, Naoko/0000-0002-2886-3022","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",14-Feb,8.0,LONDON,18235444.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,"Itoh, Takehiko/E-8873-2014; Imamoto, Naoko/A-7458-2015","Shirahige, K (reprint author), Tokyo Inst Technol, Grad Sch Biosci & Biotechnol, Midori Ku, B2C4259, Kanagawa 2268501, Japan.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,611.0,Cohesin mediates transcriptional insulation by CCCTC-binding factor,4.0,54.0,WOS:000253191400035,25.0,451,Multidisciplinary Sciences,625,jan-michael,peters,29496.0,4,male,1.0,gXj_GRwAAAAJ,5,"(17929, ]",2175303,1,2175303,1,Russell Peters,Russell Peters,1,1
148,330,3.0,"The time it takes to switch on and off electric current determines the rate at which signals can be processed and sampled in modern information technology(1-4). Field-effect transistors(1-3,5,6) are able to control currents at frequencies of the order of or higher than 100 gigahertz, but electric interconnects may hamper progress towards reaching the terahertz (10(12) hertz) range. All-optical injection of currents through interfering photoexcitation pathways(7-10) or photoconductive switching of terahertz transients(11-16) has made it possible to control electric current on a subpicosecond time-scale in semiconductors. Insulators have been deemed unsuitable for both methods, because of the need for either ultraviolet light or strong fields, which induce slow damage or ultrafast break-down(17-20), respectively. Here we report the feasibility of electric signal manipulation in a dielectric. A few-cycle optical waveform reversibly increases-free from breakdown-the a.c. conductivity of amorphous silicon dioxide (fused silica) by more than 18 orders of magnitude within 1 femtosecond, allowing electric currents to be driven, directed and switched by the instantaneous light field.

149,353,270.0,"Cortical-feedback projections to primary sensory areas terminate most heavily in layer 1 (L1) of the neocortex(1,2), where they make synapses with tuft dendrites of pyramidal neurons. L1 input is thought to provide 'contextual' information(3), but the signals transmitted by L1 feedback remain uncharacterized. In the rodent somatosensory system, the spatially diffuse(4) feedback projection from vibrissal motor cortex (vM1) to vibrissal somatosensory cortex (vS1, also known as the barrel cortex) may allow whisker touch to be interpreted in the context of whisker position to compute object location(5,6). When mice palpate objects with their whiskers to localize object features(7,8), whisker touch excites vS1(9) and later vM1 in a somatotopic manner(10-13). Here we use axonal calcium imaging to track activity in vM1 -> vS1 afferents in L1 of the barrel cortex while mice performed whisker-dependent object localization. Spatially intermingled individual axons represent whisker movements, touch and other behavioural features. In a subpopulation of axons, activity depends on object location and persists for seconds after touch. Neurons in the barrel cortex thus have information to integrate movements and touches of multiple whiskers over time, key components of object identification and navigation by active touch.","Petreanu, Leopoldo; Gutnisky, Diego A.; Huber, Daniel; Xu, Ning-long; O'Connor, Dan H.; Tian, Lin; Looger, Loren; Svoboda, Karel","Petreanu, L; Gutnisky, DA; Huber, D; Xu, NL; O'Connor, DH; Tian, L; Looger, L; Svoboda, K",299.0,"[Petreanu, Leopoldo; Gutnisky, Diego A.; Huber, Daniel; Xu, Ning-long; O'Connor, Dan H.; Tian, Lin; Looger, Loren; Svoboda, Karel] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11321,Article,1476-4687,svobodak@janelia.hhmi.org,+,Howard Hughes Medical Institute,,003UC,,,OBJECT LOCALIZATION; ACTION-POTENTIALS; VIBRISSAL SYSTEM; NEURAL ACTIVITY; BEHAVING MICE; LAYER-I; CORTEX; RAT; NEOCORTEX; ORGANIZATION,7415.0,NATURE,Nature,English,41.0,No,"Gutnisky, Diego/0000-0002-8578-0039; Xu, Ninglong/0000-0002-1651-401X; Petreanu, Leopoldo/0000-0003-1434-4691; Tian, Lin/0000-0001-7012-6926","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",13-Sep,8.0,LONDON,22922646.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2012.0,"Gutnisky, Diego/E-3846-2012; Huber, Daniel/C-2932-2013","Svoboda, K (reprint author), Howard Hughes Med Inst, Janelia Farm Res Campus, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,118.0,Activity in motor-sensory projections reveals distributed coding in somatosensation,1.0,40.0,WOS:000308635900043,270.0,489,Multidisciplinary Sciences,118,karel,svoboda,40666.0,90,male,0.92,HTuwJ_EAAAAJ,5,"(17929, ]",22728486,1,1260483,1,Karel Svoboda,Karel Svoboda,1,1

Without knowing how many SVs there are, and how they arise, it is difficult to discover what they do. Combining experimental with automated analyses, we identified 711,920 SVs at 281,243 sites in the genomes of thirteen classical and four wild-derived inbred mouse strains. The majority of SVs are less than 1 kilobase in size and 98% are deletions or insertions. The breakpoints of 160,000 SVs were mapped to base pair resolution, allowing us to infer that insertion of retrotransposons causes more than half of SVs. Yet, despite their prevalence, SVs are less likely than other sequence variants to cause gene expression or quantitative phenotypic variation. We identified 24 SVs that disrupt coding exons, acting as rare variants of large effect on gene function. One-third of the genes so affected have immunological functions.","Yalcin, Binnaz; Wong, Kim; Agam, Avigail; Goodson, Martin; Keane, Thomas M.; Gan, Xiangchao; Nellaker, Christoffer; Goodstadt, Leo; Nicod, Jerome; Bhomra, Amarjit; Hernandez-Pliego, Polinka; Whitley, Helen; Cleak, James; Dutton, Rebekah; Janowitz, Deborah; Mott, Richard; Adams, David J.; Flint, Jonathan","Yalcin, B; Wong, K; Agam, A; Goodson, M; Keane, TM; Gan, XC; Nellaker, C; Goodstadt, L; Nicod, J; Bhomra, A; Hernandez-Pliego, P; Whitley, H; Cleak, J; Dutton, R; Janowitz, D; Mott, R; Adams, DJ; Flint, J",326.0,"[Yalcin, Binnaz; Agam, Avigail; Goodson, Martin; Gan, Xiangchao; Goodstadt, Leo; Nicod, Jerome; Bhomra, Amarjit; Hernandez-Pliego, Polinka; Whitley, Helen; Cleak, James; Dutton, Rebekah; Janowitz, Deborah; Mott, Richard; Flint, Jonathan] Wellcome Trust Ctr Human Genet, Oxford OX3 7BN, England; [Wong, Kim; Keane, Thomas M.; Adams, David J.] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Cambridge CB10 1HH, England; [Agam, Avigail; Nellaker, Christoffer] Univ Oxford, Dept Physiol Anat & Genet, MRC Funct Genom Unit, Oxford OX1 3QX, England; [Janowitz, Deborah] Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Klinikum Hansestadt Stralsund, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, D-18437 Stralsund, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10432,Article,,da1@sanger.ac.uk; jf@well.ox.ac.uk,329,"Medical Research Council, UK; Wellcome Trust; Cancer Research UK","We thank A.

151,70,406.0,"Grid cells in the entorhinal cortex of freely moving rats provide a strikingly periodic representation of self-location(1) which is indicative of very specific computational mechanisms(2-4). However, the existence of grid cells in humans and their distribution throughout the brain are unknown. Here we show that the preferred firing directions of directionally modulated grid cells in rat entorhinal cortex are aligned with the grids, and that the spatial organization of grid-cell firing is more strongly apparent at faster than slower running speeds. Because the grids are also aligned with each other(1,5), we predicted a macroscopic signal visible to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans. We then looked for this signal as participants explored a virtual reality environment, mimicking the rats' foraging task: fMRI activation and adaptation showing a speed-modulated six-fold rotational symmetry in running direction. The signal was found in a network of entorhinal/subicular, posterior and medial parietal, lateral temporal and medial prefrontal areas. The effect was strongest in right entorhinal cortex, and the coherence of the directional signal across entorhinal cortex correlated with spatial memory performance. Our study illustrates the potential power of combining single-unit electrophysiology with fMRI in systems neuroscience. Our results provide evidence for grid-cell-like representations in humans, and implicate a specific type of neural representation in a network of regions which supports spatial cognition and also autobiographical memory.","Doeller, Christian F.; Barry, Caswell; Burgess, Neil","Doeller, CF; Barry, C; Burgess, N",657.0,"[Doeller, Christian F.; Barry, Caswell; Burgess, Neil] UCL Inst Cognit Neurosci, London WC1N 3AR, England; [Doeller, Christian F.; Burgess, Neil] UCL Inst Neurol, London WC1N 3BG, England; [Barry, Caswell] UCL, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Barry, Caswell] UCL, Inst Behav Neurosci, London WC1H 0AP, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08704,Article,,c.doeller@ucl.ac.uk; n.burgess@ucl.ac.uk,U87,UK Medical Research Council; European Union,"We acknowledge K.

152,114,499.0,"In yeast, the transcription factor Crz1 is dephosphorylated and translocates into the nucleus in response to extracellular calcium. Here we show, using time- lapse microscopy, that Crz1 exhibits short bursts of nuclear localization ( typically lasting 2 min) that occur stochastically in individual cells and propagate to the expression of downstream genes. Strikingly, calcium concentration controls the frequency, but not the duration, of localization bursts. Using an analytic model, we also show that this frequency modulation of bursts ensures proportional expression of multiple target genes across a wide dynamic range of expression levels, independent of promoter characteristics. We experimentally confirm this theory with natural and synthetic Crz1 target promoters. Another stress- response transcription factor, Msn2, exhibits similar, but largely uncorrelated, localization bursts under calcium stress suggesting that frequency- modulation regulation of localization bursts may be a general control strategy used by the cell to coordinate multi- gene responses to external signals.","Cai, Long; Dalal, Chiraj K.; Elowitz, Michael B.","Cai, L; Dalal, CK; Elowitz, MB",485.0,"[Cai, Long; Dalal, Chiraj K.; Elowitz, Michael B.] CALTECH, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Div Biol, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Cai, Long; Dalal, Chiraj K.; Elowitz, Michael B.] CALTECH, Dept Appl Phys, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07292,Article,,melowitz@caltech.edu,U16,"Beckman Fellows Program at Caltech; National Institutes of Health [R01GM079771]; National Centers of Systems Biology, and the Packard Foundation [P50 GM068763]","We thank M.
