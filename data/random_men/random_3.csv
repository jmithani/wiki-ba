0,130,144.0,"Follicular lymphoma (FL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) are the two most common non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs). Here we sequenced tumour and matched normal DNA from 13 DLBCL cases and one FL case to identify genes with mutations in B-cell NHL. We analysed RNA-seq data from these and another 113 NHLs to identify genes with candidate mutations, and then re-sequenced tumour and matched normal DNA from these cases to confirm 109 genes with multiple somatic mutations. Genes with roles in histone modification were frequent targets of somatic mutation. For example, 32% of DLBCL and 89% of FL cases had somatic mutations in MLL2, which encodes a histone methyltransferase, and 11.4% and 13.4% of DLBCL and FL cases, respectively, had mutations in MEF2B, a calcium-regulated gene that cooperates with CREBBP and EP300 in acetylating histones. Our analysis suggests a previously unappreciated disruption of chromatin biology in lymphomagenesis.","Morin, Ryan D.; Mendez-Lago, Maria; Mungall, Andrew J.; Goya, Rodrigo; Mungall, Karen L.; Corbett, Richard D.; Johnson, Nathalie A.; Severson, Tesa M.; Chiu, Readman; Field, Matthew; Jackman, Shaun; Krzywinski, Martin; Scott, David W.; Trinh, Diane L.; Tamura-Wells, Jessica; Li, Sa; Firme, Marlo R.; Rogic, Sanja; Griffith, Malachi; Chan, Susanna; Yakovenko, Oleksandr; Meyer, Irmtraud M.; Zhao, Eric Y.; Smailus, Duane; Moksa, Michelle; Chittaranjan, Suganthi; Rimsza, Lisa; Brooks-Wilson, Angela; Spinelli, John J.; Ben-Neriah, Susana; Meissner, Barbara; Woolcock, Bruce; Boyle, Merrill; McDonald, Helen; Tam, Angela; Zhao, Yongjun; Delaney, Allen; Zeng, Thomas; Tse, Kane; Butterfield, Yaron; Birol, Inanc; Holt, Rob; Schein, Jacqueline; Horsman, Douglas E.; Moore, Richard; Jones, Steven J.

1,33,474.0,"The oral cavity of vertebrates is generally thought to arise as an ectodermal invagination(1,2). Consistent with this, oral teeth are proposed to arise exclusively from ectoderm, contributing to tooth enamel epithelium, and from neural crest derived mesenchyme, contributing to dentin and pulp(3-5). Yet in many vertebrate groups, teeth are not restricted only to the oral cavity(6-9), but extend posteriorly as pharyngeal teeth that could be derived either directly from the endodermal epithelium, or from the ectodermal epithelium that reached this location through the mouth or through the pharyngeal slits(6). However, when the oropharyngeal membrane, which forms a sharp ecto/ endodermal border(10), is broken, the fate of these cells is poorly known. Here, using transgenic axolotls with a combination of fate- mapping approaches, we present reliable evidence of oral teeth derived from both the ectoderm and endoderm and, moreover, demonstrate teeth with a mixed ecto/ endodermal origin. Despite the enamel epithelia having a different embryonic source, oral teeth in the axolotl display striking developmental uniformities and are otherwise identical. This suggests a dominant role for the neural crest mesenchyme over epithelia in tooth initiation and, from an evolutionary point of view, that an essential factor in teeth evolution was the odontogenic capacity of neural crest cells, regardless of possible 'outside-in'(11) or 'inside-out'(12) influx of the epithelium.","Soukup, Vladimir; Epperlein, Hans-Henning; Horacek, Ivan; Cerny, Robert","Soukup, V; Epperlein, HH; Horacek, I; Cerny, R",795.0,"[Soukup, Vladimir; Horacek, Ivan; Cerny, Robert] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Zool, CR-12844 Prague, Czech Republic; [Epperlein, Hans-Henning] Tech Univ Dresden, Dept Anat, D-01307 Dresden, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07304,Article,,cerny8@natur.cuni.cz,U6,"Ministry of Youth, Education and Sport of the Czech Republic [MSMT 0021620828]; SMWK (Dresden); COST Action B23","We wish to thank E.

2,131,212.0,"The location and timing of cellular differentiation must be stringently controlled for proper organ formation. Normally, hepatocytes differentiate from hepatic progenitor cells to form the liver during development(1,2). However, previous studies have shown that the hepatic program can also be activated in non-hepatic lineage cells after exposure to particular stimuli or fusion with hepatocytes(3-9). These unexpected findings suggest that factors critical to hepatocyte differentiation exist and become activated to induce hepatocyte-specific properties in different cell types. Here, by screening the effects of twelve candidate factors, we identify three specific combinations of two transcription factors, comprising Hnf4 alpha plus Foxa1, Foxa2 or Foxa3, that can convert mouse embryonic and adult fibroblasts into cells that closely resemble hepatocytes in vitro. The induced hepatocyte-like (iHep) cells have multiple hepatocyte-specific features and reconstitute damaged hepatic tissues after transplantation. The generation of iHep cells may provide insights into the molecular nature of hepatocyte differentiation and potential therapies for liver diseases.","Sekiya, Sayaka; Suzuki, Atsushi","Sekiya, S; Suzuki, A",390.0,"[Sekiya, Sayaka; Suzuki, Atsushi] Kyushu Univ, Div Organogenesis & Regenerat, Med Inst Bioregulat, Higashi Ku, Fukuoka 8128582, Japan; [Suzuki, Atsushi] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, Precursory Res Embryon Sci & Technol PRESTO, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10263,Article,,suzukicks@bioreg.kyushu-u.ac.jp,U148,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan; Japan Science and Technology Agency","We thank A.

3,90,65.0,"Cervical cancer is responsible for 10-15% of cancer-related deaths in women worldwide(1,2). The aetiological role of infection with high-risk human papilloma viruses (HPVs) in cervical carcinomas is well established(3). Previous studies have also implicated somatic mutations in PIK3CA, PTEN, TP53, STK11 and KRAS(4-7) as well as several copy-number alterations in the pathogenesis of cervical carcinomas(8,9). Here we report whole-exome sequencing analysis of 115 cervical carcinoma-normal paired samples, transcriptome sequencing of 79 cases and whole-genome sequencing of 14 tumour-normal pairs. Previously unknown somatic mutations in 79 primary squamous cell carcinomas include recurrent E322K substitutions in the MAPK1 gene (8%), inactivating mutations in the HLA-B gene (9%), and mutations in EP300 (16%), FBXW7 (15%), NFE2L2 (4%), TP53 (5%) and ERBB2 (6%). We also observe somatic ELF3 (13%) and CBFB (8%) mutations in 24 adenocarcinomas. Squamous cell carcinomas have higher frequencies of somatic nucleotide substitutions occurring at cytosines preceded by thymines (Tp*C sites) than adenocarcinomas. Gene expression levels at HPV integration sites were statistically significantly higher in tumours with HPV integration compared with expression of the same genes in tumours without viral integration at the same site. These data demonstrate several recurrent genomic alterations in cervical carcinomas that suggest new strategies to combat this disease.","Ojesina, Akinyemi I.; Lichtenstein, Lee; Freeman, Samuel S.; Pedamallu, Chandra Sekhar;

However, analysis of the known sequences of eukaryotic miRNAs and co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that there is a clear bias for U or A at the 5' position(4-7). Here we report the crystal structure of a MID domain from a eukaryotic AGO protein, human AGO2. The structure, in complex with nucleoside monophosphates (AMP, CMP, GMP, and UMP) mimicking the 5' end of miRNAs, shows that there are specific contacts made between the base of UMP or AMP and a rigid loop in the MID domain. Notably, the structure of the loop discriminates against CMP and GMP and dissociation constants calculated from NMR titration experiments confirm these results, showing that AMP (0.26 mM) and UMP (0.12 mM) bind with up to 30-fold higher affinity than either CMP (3.6 mM) or GMP (3.3 mM). This study provides structural evidence for nucleotide-specific interactions in the MID domain of eukaryotic AGO proteins and explains the observed preference for U or A at the 5' end of miRNAs.","Frank, Filipp; Sonenberg, Nahum; Nagar, Bhushan","Frank, F; Sonenberg, N; Nagar, B",818.0,"[Frank, Filipp; Sonenberg, Nahum; Nagar, Bhushan] McGill Univ, Dept Biochem, Montreal, PQ H3G 0B1, Canada; [Frank, Filipp; Sonenberg, Nahum] McGill Univ, Goodman Canc Ctr, Montreal, PQ H3G 0B1, Canada; [Frank, Filipp; Nagar, Bhushan] Grp Rech Axe Struct Prot, Montreal, PQ H3G 0B1, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09039,Article,,bhushan.nagar@mcgill.ca,822,Canada Research Chair; Human Frontiers Science Program [CDA 0018/2006-C/1]; Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) [MOP-82929]; Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds,"We thank O.

5,68,456.0,"Theropod dinosaurs were the dominant predators inmost Mesozoic era terrestrial ecosystems(1). Early theropod evolution is currently interpreted as the diversification of various carnivorous and cursorial taxa, whereas the acquisition of herbivorism, together with the secondary loss of cursorial adaptations, occurred much later among advanced coelurosaurian theropods(1,2). A new, bizarre herbivorous basal tetanuran from the Upper Jurassic of Chile challenges this conception. The new dinosaur was discovered at Aysen, a fossil locality in the Upper Jurassic Toqui Formation of southern Chile (General Carrera Lake)(3,4). The site yielded abundant and exquisitely preserved three-dimensional skeletons of small archosaurs. Several articulated individuals of Chilesaurus at different ontogenetic stages have been collected, as well as less abundant basal crocodyliforms, and fragmentary remains of sauropod dinosaurs (diplodocids and titanosaurians).","Novas, Fernando E.; Salgado, Leonardo; Suarez, Manuel; Agnolin, Federico L.; Ezcurra, Martin D.; Chimento, Nicolas R.; de la Cruz, Rita; Isasi, Marcelo P.; Vargas, Alexander O.; Rubilar-Rogers, David","Novas, FE; Salgado, L; Suarez, M; Agnolin, FL; Ezcurra, MD; Chimento, NR; de la Cruz, R; Isasi, MP; Vargas, AO; Rubilar-Rogers, D",331.0,"[Novas, Fernando E.; Salgado, Leonardo; Isasi, Marcelo P.] Museo Argentino Ciencias Nat Bernardino Rivadavia, CONICET, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Novas, Fernando E.; Agnolin, Federico L.; Chimento, Nicolas R.; Isasi, Marcelo P.] Museo Argentino Ciencias Nat Bernardino Rivadavia, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Salgado, Leonardo] Univ Nacl Rio Negro, Inst Invest Paleobiol & Geol, CONICET, RA-8332 Gen Roca, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Salgado, Leonardo] Univ Nacl Rio Negro, Inst Invest Paleobiol & Geol, RA-8332 Gen Roca, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Suarez, Manuel] Univ Andres Bello, Geol, Fac Ingn, Santiago, Chile; [Suarez, Manuel] Univ Maimonides, Fdn Hist Nat Felix de Azara, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Ezcurra, Martin D.] Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [de la Cruz, Rita] Serv Nacl Geol & Mineria, Santiago 8330177, Chile; [Vargas, Alexander O.; Rubilar-Rogers, David] Univ Chile, Dept Biol, Lab Ontogenia & Filogenia, Red Paleontol U Chile, Santiago 7800003, Chile; [Rubilar-Rogers, David] Museo Nacl Hist Nat Chile, Area Paleontol, Santiago, Chile",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14307,Article,1476-4687,fernovas@yahoo.com.ar,+,"Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica [PICT 2010-066]; Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico [1121140, 1030162]","We thank P.

6,116,468.0,"Breast carcinoma is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in women worldwide, with an estimated 1.38 million new cases and 458,000 deaths in 2008 alone(1). This malignancy represents a heterogeneous group of tumours with characteristic molecular features, prognosis and responses to available therapy(2-4). Recurrent somatic alterations in breast cancer have been described, including mutations and copy number alterations, notably ERBB2 amplifications, the first successful therapy target defined by a genomic aberration(5). Previous DNA sequencing studies of breast cancer genomes have revealed additional candidate mutations and gene rearrangements(6-10). Here we report the whole-exome sequences of DNA from 103 human breast cancers of diverse subtypes from patients in Mexico and Vietnam compared to matched-normal DNA, together with whole-genome sequences of 22 breast cancer/normal pairs. Beyond confirming recurrent somatic mutations in PIK3CA(11), TP53(6), AKT1(12), GATA3(13) and MAP3K1(10), we discovered recurrent mutations in the CBFB transcription factor gene and deletions of its partner RUNX1. Furthermore, we have identified a recurrent MAGI3-AKT3 fusion enriched in triple-negative breast cancer lacking oestrogen and progesterone receptors and ERBB2 expression. The MAGI3-AKT3 fusion leads to constitutive activation of AKT kinase, which is abolished by treatment with an ATP-competitive AKT small-molecule inhibitor.","Banerji, Shantanu; Cibulskis, Kristian; Rangel-Escareno, Claudia; Brown, Kristin K.; Carter, Scott L.; Frederick, Abbie M.; Lawrence, Michael S.; Sivachenko, Andrey Y.; Sougnez, Carrie; Zou, Lihua; Cortes, Maria L.; Fernandez-Lopez, Juan C.; Peng, Shouyong; Ardlie, Kristin G.; Auclair, Daniel; Bautista-Pina, Veronica; Duke, Fujiko; Francis, Joshua; Jung, Joonil; Maffuz-Aziz, Antonio; Onofrio, Robert C.; Parkin, Melissa; Pho, Nam H.; Quintanar-Jurado, Valeria; Ramos, Alex H.; Rebollar-Vega, Rosa; Rodriguez-Cuevas, Sergio; Romero-Cordoba, Sandra L.; Schumacher, Steven E.; Stransky, Nicolas; Thompson, Kristin M.; Uribe-Figueroa, Laura; Baselga, Jose; Beroukhim, Rameen; Polyak, Kornelia; Sgroi, Dennis C.; Richardson, Andrea L.; Jimenez-Sanchez, Gerardo; Lander, Eric S.; Gabriel, Stacey B.; Garraway, Levi A.; Golub, Todd R.; Melendez-Zajgla, Jorge; Toker, Alex; Getz, Gad; Hidalgo-Miranda, Alfredo; Meyerson, Matthew","Banerji, S; Cibulskis, K; Rangel-Escareno, C; Brown, KK; Carter, SL; Frederick, AM; Lawrence, MS; Sivachenko, AY; Sougnez, C; Zou, LH; Cortes, ML; Fernandez-Lopez, JC; Peng, SY; Ardlie, KG; Auclair, D; Bautista-Pina, V; Duke, F; Francis, J; Jung, J; Maffuz-Aziz, A; Onofrio, RC; Parkin, M; Pho, NH; Quintanar-Jurado, V; Ramos, AH; Rebollar-Vega, R; Rodriguez-Cuevas, S; Romero-Cordoba, SL; Schumacher, SE; Stransky, N; Thompson, KM; Uribe-Figueroa, L; Baselga, J; Beroukhim, R; Polyak, K; Sgroi, DC; Richardson, AL; Jimenez-Sanchez, G; Lander, ES; Gabriel, SB; Garraway, LA; Golub, TR; Melendez-Zajgla, J; Toker, A; Getz, G; Hidalgo-Miranda, A; Meyerson, M",405.0,"[Banerji, Shantanu; Cibulskis, Kristian; Carter, Scott L.; Frederick, Abbie M.; Lawrence, Michael S.; Sivachenko, Andrey Y.; Sougnez, Carrie; Zou, Lihua; Cortes, Maria L.; Ardlie, Kristin G.; Auclair, Daniel; Duke, Fujiko; Francis, Joshua; Jung, Joonil; Onofrio, Robert C.; Parkin, Melissa; Pho, Nam H.; Ramos, Alex H.; Schumacher, Steven E.; Stransky, Nicolas; Thompson, Kristin M.; Beroukhim, Rameen; Lander, Eric S.; Gabriel, Stacey B.; Garraway, Levi A.; Golub, Todd R.; Getz, Gad; Meyerson, Matthew] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Banerji, Shantanu; Peng, Shouyong; Schumacher, Steven E.; Beroukhim, Rameen; Polyak, Kornelia; Richardson, Andrea L.; Garraway, Levi A.; Meyerson, Matthew] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Banerji, Shantanu; Baselga, Jose; Beroukhim, Rameen; Polyak, Kornelia; Sgroi, Dennis C.; Richardson, Andrea L.; Lander, Eric S.; Garraway, Levi A.; Golub, Todd R.; Toker, Alex; Meyerson, Matthew] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Rangel-Escareno, Claudia; Fernandez-Lopez, Juan C.; Quintanar-Jurado, Valeria; Rebollar-Vega, Rosa; Romero-Cordoba, Sandra L.; Uribe-Figueroa, Laura; Jimenez-Sanchez, Gerardo; Melendez-Zajgla, Jorge; Hidalgo-Miranda, Alfredo] Inst Nacl Med Genom, Mexico City 01900, DF, Mexico; [Brown, Kristin K.; Toker, Alex] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Bautista-Pina, Veronica; Maffuz-Aziz, Antonio; Rodriguez-Cuevas, Sergio] FUCAM, Inst Enfermedades Mama, Mexico City 04980, DF, Mexico; [Baselga, Jose] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Div Hematol & Oncol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Beroukhim, Rameen; Meyerson, Matthew] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Biol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Polyak, Kornelia] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Sgroi, Dennis C.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Richardson, Andrea L.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Lander, Eric S.] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Golub, Todd R.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Pediat Oncol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Golub, Todd R.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chevy Chase, MD 20815 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11154,Article,1476-4687,atoker@bidmc.harvard.edu; gadgetz@broadinstitute.org; ahidalgo@inmegen.gob.mx; matthew_meyerson@dfci.harvard.edu,409,Carlos Slim Health Institute in Mexico; CancerCare Manitoba; University of Manitoba; John Gavin Post-doctoral Fellowship; Genesis Oncology Trust of New Zealand; Mexican Council of Science and Technology (CONACyT); NIH [CA122099]; Dana-Farber/Harvard SPORE in breast cancer under NCI grant [CA089393],"We would like to thank all patients who contributed samples to this study.

7,59,228.0,"During eukaryotic translation initiation, 43S complexes, comprising a 40S ribosomal subunit, initiator transfer RNA and initiation factors (eIF) 2, 3, 1 and 1A, attach to the 59-terminal region of messenger RNA and scan along it to the initiation codon. Scanning on structured mRNAs also requires the DExH-box protein DHX29. Mammalian eIF3 contains 13 subunits and participates in nearly all steps of translation initiation. Eight subunits having PCI (proteasome, COP9 signalosome, eIF3) or MPN (Mpr1, Pad1, amino-terminal) domains constitute the structural core of eIF3, to which five peripheral subunits are flexibly linked. Here we present a cryo-electron microscopy structure of eIF3 in the context of the DHX29-bound 43S complex, showing the PCI/MPN core at,6 angstrom resolution. It reveals the organization of the individual subunits and their interactions with components of the 43S complex. We were able to build near-complete polyalanine-level models of the eIF3 PCI/MPN core and of two peripheral subunits. The implications for understanding mRNA ribosomal attachment and scanning are discussed.","des Georges, Amedee; Dhote, Vidya; Kuhn, Lauriane; Hellen, Christopher U.

8,100,305.0,"X-ray single-crystal diffraction (SCD) analysis has the intrinsic limitation that the target molecules must be obtained as single crystals. Here we report a protocol for SCD analysis that does not require the crystallization of the sample. In our method, tiny crystals of porous complexes are soaked in a solution of the target, such that the complexes can absorb the target molecules. Crystallographic analysis clearly determines the absorbed guest structures along with the host frameworks. Because the SCD analysis is carried out on only one tiny crystal of the complex, the required sample mass is of the nanogram-microgram order. We demonstrate that as little as about 80 nanograms of a sample is enough for the SCD analysis. In combination with high-performance liquid chromatography, our protocol allows the direct characterization of multiple fractions, establishing a prototypical means of liquid chromatography SCD analysis. Furthermore, we unambiguously determined the structure of a scarce marine natural product using only 5 micrograms of the compound.","Inokuma, Yasuhide; Yoshioka, Shota; Ariyoshi, Junko; Arai, Tatsuhiko; Hitora, Yuki; Takada, Kentaro; Matsunaga, Shigeki; Rissanen, Kari; Fujita, Makoto","Inokuma, Y; Yoshioka, S; Ariyoshi, J; Arai, T; Hitora, Y; Takada, K; Matsunaga, S; Rissanen, K; Fujita, M",461.0,"[Inokuma, Yasuhide; Yoshioka, Shota; Ariyoshi, Junko; Arai, Tatsuhiko; Fujita, Makoto] Univ Tokyo, Dept Appl Chem, Grad Sch Engn, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138656, Japan; [Hitora, Yuki; Takada, Kentaro; Matsunaga, Shigeki] Univ Tokyo, Lab Aquat Nat Prod Chem, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138657, Japan; [Rissanen, Kari] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Chem, NanoSci Ctr, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11990,Article,1476-4687,mfujita@appchem.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp,+,CREST project of the Japan Science and Technology Agency;  [24000009];  [23750146],"This research was supported by Grants-in-Aid for Specially Promoted Research (24000009) and Young Scientists (B) (23750146), and by the CREST project of the Japan Science and Technology Agency.

Although lobopodians occupy a deep phylogenetic position within Panarthropoda, a shortage of derived characters obscures their evolutionary relationships with extant phyla (Onychophora, Tardigrada and Euarthropoda)(2,3,5,10-15). Here we describe a complex feature in the terminal claws of the mid-Cambrian lobopodian Hallucigenia sparsa-their construction from a stack of constituent elements-and demonstrate that equivalent elements make up the jaws and claws of extant Onychophora. A cladistic analysis, informed by developmental data on panarthropod head segmentation, indicates that the stacked sclerite components in these two taxa are homologous-resolving hallucigeniid lobopodians as stem-group onychophorans. The results indicate a sister-group relationship between Tardigrada and Euarthropoda, adding palaeontological support to the neurological(16,17) and musculoskeletal(18,19) evidence uniting these disparate clades.

It predicts that males obtain greater fitness benefits than females through multiple mating because sperm are cheaper to produce than eggs. Sexual selection should therefore lead to the evolution of male-biased secondary sexual characters. However, females of many species are also highly ornamented(5-7). The view that this is due to a correlated genetic response to selection on males(1,8) was widely accepted as an explanation for female ornamentation for over 100 years(5) and current theoretical(9,10) and empirical(11-13) evidence suggests that genetic constraints can limit sex-specific trait evolution. Alternatively, female ornamentation can be the outcome of direct selection for signalling needs(7,14). Since few studies have explored interspecific patterns of both male and female elaboration, our understanding of the evolution of animal ornamentation remains incomplete, especially over broad taxonomic scales. Here we use a new method to quantify plumage colour of all similar to 6,000 species of passerine birds to determine the main evolutionary drivers of ornamental colouration in both sexes. We found that conspecific male and female colour elaboration are strongly correlated, suggesting that evolutionary changes in one sex are constrained by changes in the other sex. Both sexes are more ornamented in larger species and in species living in tropical environments. Ornamentation in females (but not males) is increased in cooperative breeders-species in which female-female competition for reproductive opportunities and other resources related to breeding may be high(6). Finally, strong sexual selection on males has antagonistic effects, causing an increase in male colouration but a considerably more pronounced reduction in female ornamentation. Our results indicate that although there may be genetic constraints to sexually independent colour evolution, both female and male ornamentation are strongly and often differentially related to morphological, social and life-history variables.","Dale, James; Dey, Cody J.; Delhey, Kaspar; Kempenaers, Bart; Valcu, Mihai","Dale, J; Dey, CJ; Delhey, K; Kempenaers, B; Valcu, M",367.0,"[Dale, James] Massey Univ, Inst Nat & Math Sci, Auckland 0745, New Zealand; [Dey, Cody J.] McMaster Univ, Dept Biol, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada; [Delhey, Kaspar] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Delhey, Kaspar] Max Planck Inst Ornithol, D-78315 Radolfzell am Bodensee, Germany; [Kempenaers, Bart; Valcu, Mihai] Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Dept Behav Ecol & Evolutionary Genet, D-82319 Seewiesen, Germany",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15509,Article,1476-4687,j.dale@massey.ac.nz,+,Massey University; Australian and Pacific Science Foundation [APSF 10/8]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Canadian Graduate Scholarship; Australian Research Council [DE120102323]; Max Planck Society,"We thank the many ornithologists and scientists who have published their data or contributed data to public databases, allowing us to conduct this study.

11,66,350.0,"Soils of the northern high latitudes store carbon over millennial timescales (thousands of years) and contain approximately double the carbon stock of the atmosphere(1-3). Warming and associated permafrost thaw can expose soil organic carbon and result in mineralization and carbon dioxide (CO2) release(4-6). However, some of this soil organic carbon may be eroded and transferred to rivers(7-9). If it escapes degradation during river transport and is buried in marine sediments, then it can contribute to a longer-term (more than ten thousand years), geological CO2 sink(8-10). Despite this recognition, the erosional flux and fate of particulate organic carbon (POC) in large rivers at high latitudes remains poorly constrained. Here, we quantify the source of POC in the Mackenzie River, the main sediment supplier to the Arctic Ocean(11,12), and assess its flux and fate. We combine measurements of radiocarbon, stable carbon isotopes and element ratios to correct for rock-derived POC10,13,14. Our samples reveal that the eroded biospheric POC has resided in the basin for millennia, with a mean radiocarbon age of 5,800 +/- 800 years, much older than the POC in large tropical rivers(13,14). From the measured biospheric POC content and variability in annual sediment yield(15), we calculate a biospheric POC flux of 2.2(-0.9)(+1.3) teragrams of carbon per year from the Mackenzie River, which is three times the CO2 drawdown by silicate weathering in this basin(16). Offshore, we find evidence for efficient terrestrial organic carbon burial over the Holocene period, suggesting that erosion of organic carbon-rich, high-latitude soils may result in an important geological CO2 sink.","Hilton, Robert G.; Galy, Valier; Gaillardet, Jerome; Dellinger, Mathieu; Bryant, Charlotte; O'Regan, Matt; Groecke, Darren R.; Coxall, Helen; Bouchez, Julien; Calmels, Damien","Hilton, RG; Galy, V; Gaillardet, J; Dellinger, M; Bryant, C; O'Regan, M; Grocke, DR; Coxall, H; Bouchez, J; Calmels, D",84.0,"[Hilton, Robert G.] Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Durham DH1 3LE, England; [Galy, Valier] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Marine Chem & Geochem, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Gaillardet, Jerome; Dellinger, Mathieu; Bouchez, Julien] Univ Paris Diderot, Inst Phys Globe Paris, Sorbonne Paris Cite, UMR CNRS 7154, F-75005 Paris, France; [Bryant, Charlotte] NERC Radiocarbon Facil, E Kilbride G75 OQF, Lanark, Scotland; [O'Regan, Matt; Coxall, Helen] Stockholm Univ, Dept Geol Sci, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Groecke, Darren R.] Univ Durham, Dept Earth Sci, Durham DH1 3LE, England; [Calmels, Damien] Univ Paris 11, Lab GEOPS, UMR CNRS 8148, F-91405 Orsay, France",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14653,Article,1476-4687,r.g.hilton@durham.ac.uk,U162,"Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), UK [1611.0312]; CNRS (OXYMORE); CNRS (CANNIBALT); Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Arctic Research Initiative; Early Career Research Grant by the British Society for Geomorphology; US National Science Foundation [OCE-0928582]; Royal Society University Fellowship","Radiocarbon measurements were funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), UK (Allocation 1611.0312) to R.G.H and C.B.

12,42,382.0,"Bacteriophage lambda has for many years been a model system for understanding mechanisms of gene regulation(1). A 'genetic switch' enables the phage to transition from lysogenic growth to lytic development when triggered by specific environmental conditions. The key component of the switch is the cI repressor, which binds to two sets of three operator sites on the lambda chromosome that are separated by about 2,400 base pairs (bp)(2,3). A hallmark of the lambda system is the pairwise cooperativity of repressor binding(4). In the absence of detailed structural information, it has been difficult to understand fully how repressor molecules establish the cooperativity complex. Here we present the X- ray crystal structure of the intact lambda cI repressor dimer bound to a DNA operator site. The structure of the repressor, determined by multiple isomorphous replacement methods, reveals an unusual overall architecture that allows it to adopt a conformation that appears to facilitate pairwise cooperative binding to adjacent operator sites.","Stayrook, Steven; Jaru-Ampornpan, Peera; Ni, Jenny; Hochschild, Ann; Lewis, Mitchell","Stayrook, S; Jaru-Ampornpan, P; Ni, J; Hochschild, A; Lewis, M",1022.0,"[Stayrook, Steven; Jaru-Ampornpan, Peera; Ni, Jenny; Lewis, Mitchell] Univ Penn, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Philadelphia, PA 19102 USA; [Hochschild, Ann] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Mol Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06831,Article,,lewis@mail.med.upenn.edu,U12,NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM044025],,291PF,,,BACTERIOPHAGE-LAMBDA; LEXA; CLEAVAGE; DOMAIN; CRYSTALLOGRAPHY; RECOGNITION; PROTEIN; DIMERS,7190.0,NATURE,Nature,English,23.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",24-Apr,5.0,LONDON,18432246.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,,"Lewis, M (reprint author), Univ Penn, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Biophys, 37th & Hamilton Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19102 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,49.0,Crystal structure of the lambda repressor and a model for pairwise cooperative operator binding,1.0,10.0,WOS:000255208600045,382.0,452,Multidisciplinary Sciences,49,mitchell,lewis,534.0,345,male,0.99,Gy-X2vgAAAAJ,1,"[0, 1474]",13937844,1,46310693,1,Mitchell Lewis,Mitchell Lewis,1,1
13,103,416.0,"Progress in imaging and metrology depends on exquisite control over and comprehensive characterization of wave fields. As reflected in its name, coherent diffractive imaging relies on high coherence when reconstructing highly resolved images from diffraction intensities alone without the need for image-forming lenses(1-3). Fully coherent light can be described adequately by a single pure state. Yet partial coherence and imperfect detection often need to be accounted for, requiring statistical optics or the superposition of states(4,5). Furthermore, the dynamics of samples are increasingly the very objectives of experiments(6). Here we provide a general analytic approach to the characterization of diffractive imaging systems that can be described as low-rank mixed states. We use experimental data and simulations to show how the reconstruction technique compensates for and characterizes various sources of decoherence quantitatively. Based on ptychography(7,8), the procedure is closely related to quantum state tomography and is equally applicable to high-resolution microscopy, wave sensing and fluctuation measurements. As a result, some of the most stringent experimental conditions in ptychography can be relaxed, and susceptibility to imaging artefacts is reduced. Furthermore, the method yields high-resolution images of mixed states within the sample, which may include quantum mixtures or fast stationary stochastic processes such as vibrations, switching or steady flows.","Thibault, Pierre; Menzel, Andreas","Thibault, P; Menzel, A",68.0,"[Thibault, Pierre] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Phys, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Menzel, Andreas] Paul Scherrer Inst, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11806,Article,,pierre.thibault@tum.de,71,European Research Council [279753],"We thank M.

14,24,231.0,"Haemodynamic signals underlying functional brain imaging ( for example, functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI)) are assumed to reflect metabolic demand generated by local neuronal activity, with equal increases in haemodynamic signal implying equal increases in the underlying neuronal activity(1-6). Few studies have compared neuronal and haemodynamic signals in alert animals(7,8) to test for this assumed correspondence. Here we present evidence that brings this assumption into question. Using a dual-wavelength optical imaging technique(9) that independently measures cerebral blood volume and oxygenation, continuously, in alert behaving monkeys, we find two distinct components to the haemodynamic signal in the alert animals' primary visual cortex (V1). One component is reliably predictable from neuronal responses generated by visual input. The other component - of almost comparable strength - is a hither to unknown signal that entrains to task structure independently of visual input or of standard neural predictors of haemodynamics. This latter component shows predictive timing, with increases of cerebral blood volume in anticipation of trial onsets even in darkness. This trial- locked haemodynamic signal could be due to an accompanying V1 arterial pumping mechanism, closely matched in time, with peaks of arterial dilation entrained to predicted trial onsets. These findings ( tested in two animals) challenge the current understanding of the link between brain haemodynamics and local neuronal activity. They also suggest the existence of a novel preparatory mechanism in the brain that brings additional arterial blood to cortex in anticipation of expected tasks.","Sirotin, Yevgeniy B.; Das, Aniruddha","Sirotin, YB; Das, A",475.0,"[Sirotin, Yevgeniy B.; Das, Aniruddha] Columbia Univ, Dept Neurosci, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Das, Aniruddha] Columbia Univ, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Das, Aniruddha] Columbia Univ, WM Keck Ctr Brain Plastic & Cognit, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Das, Aniruddha] Columbia Univ, Mahoney Ctr Brain & Behav, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Das, Aniruddha] Columbia Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Das, Aniruddha] New York State Psychiat Inst & Hosp, Unit 87, New York, NY 10032 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07664,Article,,ad2069@columbia.edu,U6,Keck foundation; National Institutes of Health; Klingenstein Foundation; Gatsby Initiative in Brain Circuitry; Dana Foundation; National Research Service Award,"We thank: K.

15,96,165.0,"Understanding the origins of the diversity in terrestrial planets is a fundamental goal in Earth and planetary sciences. In the Solar System, Venus has a similar size and bulk composition to those of Earth, but it lacks water(1-3). Because a richer variety of exoplanets is expected to be discovered, prediction of their atmospheres and surface environments requires a general framework for planetary evolution. Here we show that terrestrial planets can be divided into two distinct types on the basis of their evolutionary history during solidification from the initially hot molten state expected from the standard formation model(4,5). Even if, apart from their orbits, they were identical just after formation, the solidified planets can have different characteristics. A type I planet, which is formed beyond a certain critical distance from the host star, solidifies within several million years. If the planet acquires water during formation, most of this water is retained and forms the earliest oceans. In contrast, on a type II planet, which is formed inside the critical distance, a magma ocean can be sustained for longer, even with a larger initial amount of water. Its duration could be as long as 100 million years if the planet is formed together with a mass of water comparable to the total inventory of the modern Earth. Hydrodynamic escape desiccates type II planets during the slow solidification process. Although Earth is categorized as type I, it is not clear which type Venus is because its orbital distance is close to the critical distance. However, because the dryness of the surface and mantle predicted for type II planets is consistent with the characteristics of Venus, it may be representative of type II planets. Also, future observations may have a chance to detect not only terrestrial exoplanets covered with water ocean but also those covered with magma ocean around a young star.","Hamano, Keiko; Abe, Yutaka; Genda, Hidenori","Hamano, K; Abe, Y; Genda, H",607.0,"[Hamano, Keiko; Abe, Yutaka; Genda, Hidenori] Univ Tokyo, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Genda, Hidenori] Tokyo Inst Technol, Earth Life Sci Inst, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1528551, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12163,Article,,keiko@eps.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp,+,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology [23103003]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [23340168, 22740291]","We thank J.F.

16,114,346.0,"Silicon transistors are expected to have new gate architectures, channel materials and switching mechanisms in ten years' time(1-4). The trend in transistor scaling has already led to a change in gate structure from two dimensions to three, used in fin field-effect transistors, to avoid problems inherent in miniaturization such as high off-state leakage current and the short-channel effect. At present, planar and fin architectures using III-V materials, specifically InGaAs, are being explored as alternative fast channels on silicon(5-9) because of their high electron mobility and high-quality interface with gate dielectrics(10). The idea of surrounding-gate transistors(11), in which the gate is wrapped around a nanowire channel to provide the best possible electrostatic gate control, using InGaAs channels on silicon, however, has been less well investigated(12,13) because of difficulties in integrating free-standing InGaAs nanostructures on silicon. Here we report the position-controlled growth of vertical InGaAs nanowires on silicon without any buffering technique and demonstrate surrounding-gate transistors using InGaAs nanowires and InGaAs/InP/InAlAs/InGaAs core-multishell nanowires as channels. Surrounding-gate transistors using core-multishell nanowire channels with a six-sided, high-electron-mobility transistor structure greatly enhance the on-state current and transconductance while keeping good gate controllability. These devices provide a route to making vertically oriented transistors for the next generation of field-effect transistors and may be useful as building blocks for wireless networks on silicon platforms.","Tomioka, Katsuhiro; Yoshimura, Masatoshi; Fukui, Takashi","Tomioka, K; Yoshimura, M; Fukui, T",189.0,"[Tomioka, Katsuhiro; Yoshimura, Masatoshi; Fukui, Takashi] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608628, Japan; [Tomioka, Katsuhiro; Yoshimura, Masatoshi; Fukui, Takashi] Hokkaido Univ, RCIQE, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608628, Japan; [Tomioka, Katsuhiro] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy PRESTO, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11293,Article,,tomioka@rciqe.hokudai.ac.jp,+,MEXT; Japan Science and Technology Agency - PRESTO programme,"We thank J.

The critical underlying technique is electromagnetically induced transparency, in which quantum interference between transitions in multilevel atoms(11-15) renders an opaque medium transparent near an atomic resonance. With the advent of high-brilliance, accelerator-driven light sources such as storage rings or X-ray lasers, it has become attractive to extend the techniques of optical quantum control to the X-ray regime(16,17). Here we demonstrate electromagnetically induced transparency in the regime of hard X-rays, using the 14.4-kiloelectronvolt nuclear resonance of the Mossbauer isotope iron-57 (a two-level system). We exploit cooperative emission from ensembles of the nuclei, which are embedded in a low-finesse cavity and excited by synchrotron radiation. The spatial modulation of the photonic density of states in a cavity mode leads to the coexistence of superradiant and subradiant states of nuclei, respectively located at an antinode and a node of the cavity field. This scheme causes the nuclei to behave as effective three-level systems, with two degenerate levels in the excited state (one of which can be considered metastable). The radiative coupling of the nuclear ensembles by the cavity field establishes the atomic coherence necessary for the cancellation of resonant absorption. Because this technique does not require atomic systems with a metastable level, electromagnetically induced transparency and its applications can be transferred to the regime of nuclear resonances, establishing the field of nuclear quantum optics.","Roehlsberger, Ralf; Wille, Hans-Christian; Schlage, Kai; Sahoo, Balaram","Rohlsberger, R; Wille, HC; Schlage, K; Sahoo, B",199.0,"[Roehlsberger, Ralf; Wille, Hans-Christian; Schlage, Kai; Sahoo, Balaram] Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron, D-22607 Hamburg, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10741,Article,1476-4687,ralf.roehlsberger@desy.de,203,,,888HI,,,POPULATION-INVERSION; LASER OSCILLATION; ATOMIC GAS; OPTICS,7384.0,NATURE,Nature,English,29.0,No,"Sahoo, Balaram/0000-0002-2050-4746; Rohlsberger, Ralf/0000-0001-6005-5183; Wille, Hans-Christian/0000-0003-0851-3831","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",9-Feb,5.0,LONDON,22318603.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2012.0,"Sahoo, Balaram/E-4828-2011; Wille, Hans-Christian/C-3881-2013; Rohlsberger, Ralf/J-4173-2013","Rohlsberger, R (reprint author), Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron, Notkestr 85, D-22607 Hamburg, Germany.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,80.0,Electromagnetically induced transparency with resonant nuclei in a cavity,3.0,63.0,WOS:000299994100034,262.0,482,Multidisciplinary Sciences,80,balaram,sahoo,806.0,3,male,1.0,6cDBwBEAAAAJ,1,"[0, 1474]",44231522,1,4773382,1,Orthosilicate (ion),Orthosilicate (ion),0,0
18,109,258.0,"Epigenetic information is frequently erased near the start of each new generation(1). In some cases, however, epigenetic information can be transmitted from parent to progeny (multigenerational epigenetic inheritance)(2). A particularly notable example of this type of epigenetic inheritance is double-stranded RNA-mediated gene silencing in Caenorhabditis elegans. This RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) can be inherited for more than five generations(3-8). To understand this process, here we conduct a genetic screen for nematodes defective in transmitting RNAi silencing signals to future generations. This screen identified the heritable RNAi defective 1 (hrde-1) gene. hrde-1 encodes an Argonaute protein that associates with small interfering RNAs in the germ cells of progeny of animals exposed to double-stranded RNA. In the nuclei of these germ cells, HRDE-1 engages the nuclear RNAi defective pathway to direct the trimethylation of histone H3 at Lys 9 (H3K9me3) at RNAi-targeted genomic loci and promote RNAi inheritance. Under normal growth conditions, HRDE-1 associates with endogenously expressed short interfering RNAs, which direct nuclear gene silencing in germ cells. In hrde-1- or nuclear RNAi-deficient animals, germline silencing is lost over generational time. Concurrently, these animals exhibit steadily worsening defects in gamete formation and function that ultimately lead to sterility. These results establish that the Argonaute protein HRDE-1 directs gene-silencing events in germ-cell nuclei that drive multigenerational RNAi inheritance and promote immortality of the germ-cell lineage. We propose that C. elegans use the RNAi inheritance machinery to transmit epigenetic information, accrued by past generations, into future generations to regulate important biological processes.","Buckley, Bethany A.; Burkhart, Kirk B.; Gu, Sam Guoping; Spracklin, George; Kershner, Aaron; Fritz, Heidi; Kimble, Judith; Fire, Andrew; Kennedy, Scott","Buckley, BA; Burkhart, KB; Gu, SG; Spracklin, G; Kershner, A; Fritz, H; Kimble, J; Fire, A; Kennedy, S",447.0,"[Buckley, Bethany A.; Burkhart, Kirk B.; Spracklin, George; Fritz, Heidi; Kimble, Judith; Kennedy, Scott] Univ Wisconsin, Lab Genet, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Gu, Sam Guoping; Fire, Andrew] Stanford Univ, Dept Pathol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Gu, Sam Guoping; Fire, Andrew] Stanford Univ, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kershner, Aaron; Fritz, Heidi] Univ Wisconsin, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Kershner, Aaron; Kimble, Judith] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biochem, Madison, WI 53706 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11352,Article,,sgkennedy@wisc.edu,451,"Pew scholar's program; Shaw scholar's program; National Institutes of Health [GM88289, GM37706, GM069454]","We thank P.

19,19,130.0,"Ubiquitin-like proteins (UBLs) can change protein function, localization or turnover by covalent attachment to lysine residues(1). Although UBLs achieve this conjugation through an intricate enzymatic cascade, their bacterial counterparts MoaD and ThiS function as sulphur carrier proteins(2,3). Here we show that Urm1p, the most ancient UBL3, acts as a sulphur carrier in the process of eukaryotic transfer RNA ( tRNA) modification, providing a possible evolutionary link between UBL and sulphur transfer. Moreover, we identify Uba4p, Ncs2p, Ncs6p and Yor251cp as components of this conserved pathway. Using in vitro assays, we show that Ncs6p binds to tRNA, whereas Uba4p first adenylates and then directly transfers sulphur onto Urm1p. Finally, functional analysis reveals that the thiolation function of Urm1p is critical to regulate cellular responses to nutrient starvation and oxidative stress conditions, most likely by increasing translation fidelity.","Leidel, Sebastian; Pedrioli, Patrick G.

20,3,366.0,"Negative feedback is common in biological processes and can increase a system's stability to internal and external perturbations. But at the molecular level, control loops always involve signalling steps with finite rates for random births and deaths of individual molecules. Here we show, by developing mathematical tools that merge control and information theory with physical chemistry, that seemingly mild constraints on these rates place severe limits on the ability to suppress molecular fluctuations. Specifically, the minimum standard deviation in abundances decreases with the quartic root of the number of signalling events, making it extremely expensive to increase accuracy. Our results are formulated in terms of experimental observables, and existing data show that cells use brute force when noise suppression is essential; for example, regulatory genes are transcribed tens of thousands of times per cell cycle. The theory challenges conventional beliefs about biochemical accuracy and presents an approach to the rigorous analysis of poorly characterized biological systems.","Lestas, Ioannis; Vinnicombe, Glenn; Paulsson, Johan","Lestas, I; Vinnicombe, G; Paulsson, J",174.0,"[Lestas, Ioannis; Vinnicombe, Glenn] Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Cambridge CB2 1PZ, England; [Paulsson, Johan] Harvard Univ, Dept Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09333,Article,,gv@eng.cam.ac.uk; johan_paulsson@hms.harvard.edu,178,"BBSRC [BB/C008073/1]; National Science Foundation [DMS-074876-0, 0720056]; National Institutes of Health [GM081563-02, GM068763-06]","This research was supported by the BBSRC under grant BB/C008073/1, by the National Science Foundation grants DMS-074876-0 and CAREER 0720056, and by grants GM081563-02 and GM068763-06 from the National Institutes of Health.",647KB,,,PLASMID REPLICATION; FEEDBACK-CONTROL; GENE-EXPRESSION; POISSON-TYPE; SINGLE-CELL; NOISE; PERFORMANCE; INFORMATION; LIMITATIONS; ROBUSTNESS,7312.0,NATURE,Nature,English,32.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",9-Sep,5.0,LONDON,20829788.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2010.0,,"Vinnicombe, G (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Cambridge CB2 1PZ, England.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,177.0,Fundamental limits on the suppression of molecular fluctuations,5.0,45.0,WOS:000281616300027,366.0,467,Multidisciplinary Sciences,179,johan,paulsson,1182.0,1060,male,1.0,InLmIDEAAAAJ,1,"[0, 1474]",32639984,1,32639984,1,Johan Paulsson,Johan Paulsson,1,1
21,86,406.0,"Tropical forests are global epicentres of biodiversity and important modulators of climate change(1), and are mainly constrained by rainfall patterns(1-3). The severe short-term droughts that occurred recently in Amazonia have drawn attention to the vulnerability of tropical forests to climatic disturbances(4-9). The central African rainforests, the second-largest on Earth, have experienced a long-term drying trend(10,11) whose impacts on vegetation dynamics remain mostly unknown because in situ observations are very limited. The Congolese forest, with its drier conditions and higher percentage of semi-evergreen trees(12,13), may be more tolerant to short-term rainfall reduction than are wetter tropical forests(11), but for a long-term drought there may be critical thresholds of water availability below which higher-biomass, closed-canopy forests transition to more open, lower-biomass forests(1,2,14). Here we present observational evidence for a widespread decline in forest greenness over the past decade based on analyses of satellite data (optical, thermal, microwave and gravity) from several independent sensors over the Congo basin. This decline in vegetation greenness, particularly in the northern Congolese forest, is generally consistent with decreases in rainfall, terrestrial water storage, water content in aboveground woody and leaf biomass, and the canopy backscatter anomaly caused by changes in structure and moisture in upper forest layers. It is also consistent with increases in photosynthetically active radiation and land surface temperature. These multiple lines of evidence indicate that this large-scale vegetation browning, or loss of photosynthetic capacity, may be partially attributable to the long-term drying trend. Our results suggest that a continued gradual decline of photosynthetic capacity and moisture content driven by the persistent drying trend could alter the composition and structure of the Congolese forest to favour the spread of drought-tolerant species(1,2,14).","Zhou, Liming; Tian, Yuhong; Myneni, Ranga B.; Ciais, Philippe; Saatchi, Sassan; Liu, Yi Y.; Piao, Shilong; Chen, Haishan; Vermote, Eric F.; Song, Conghe; Hwang, Taehee","Zhou, LM; Tian, YH; Myneni, RB; Ciais, P; Saatchi, S; Liu, YY; Piao, SL; Chen, HS; Vermote, EF; Song, CH; Hwang, TH",86.0,"[Zhou, Liming] SUNY Albany, Dept Atmospher & Environm Sci, Albany, NY 12222 USA; [Tian, Yuhong] NOAA, IMSG, NESDIS, Ctr Satellite Applicat & Res,STAR, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Myneni, Ranga B.] Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Ciais, Philippe] UVSQ, CEA, CNRS, LSCE, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Saatchi, Sassan] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA; [Liu, Yi Y.] Univ New S Wales, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Syst Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Liu, Yi Y.] Univ New S Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Piao, Shilong] Peking Univ, Dept Ecol, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Chen, Haishan] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Minist Educ, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Vermote, Eric F.] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Song, Conghe] Univ N Carolina, Dept Geog, Chapel Hill, NC 29599 USA; [Song, Conghe] Anhui Agr Univ, Sch Forestry & Landscape Architecture, Hefei 230036, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Hwang, Taehee] Univ N Carolina, Inst Environm, Chapel Hill, NC 29599 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13265,Article,1476-4687,lzhou@albany.edu,+,"NOAA NESDIS [NA11NES4400010]; University at Albany, State University of New York; NASA's Earth Science Division; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41230422]","This study was supported by the NOAA NESDIS project (NA11NES4400010) and by the startup funds provided by the University at Albany, State University of New York.

22,69,473.0,"We generated genome-wide data from 69 Europeans who lived between 8,000-3,000 years ago by enriching ancient DNA libraries for a target set of almost 400,000 polymorphisms. Enrichment of these positions decreases the sequencing required for genome-wide ancient DNA analysis by a median of around 250-fold, allowing us to study an order of magnitude more individuals than previous studies(1-8) and to obtain new insights about the past. We show that the populations of Western and Far Eastern Europe followed opposite trajectories between 8,000-5,000 years ago. At the beginning of the Neolithic period in Europe, similar to 8,000-7,000 years ago, closely related groups of early farmers appeared in Germany, Hungary and Spain, different from indigenous hunter-gatherers, whereas Russia was inhabited by a distinctive population of hunter-gatherers with high affinity to a similar to 24,000-year-old Siberian(6). By similar to 6,000-5,000 years ago, farmers throughout much of Europe had more hunter-gatherer ancestry than their predecessors, but in Russia, the Yamnaya steppe herders of this time were descended not only from the preceding eastern European hunter-gatherers, but also from a population of Near Eastern ancestry. Western and Eastern Europe came into contact similar to 4,500 years ago, as the Late Neolithic Corded Ware people from Germany traced similar to 75% of their ancestry to the Yamnaya, documenting a massive migration into the heartland of Europe from its eastern periphery. This steppe ancestry persisted in all sampled central Europeans until at least similar to 3,000 years ago, and is ubiquitous in present-day Europeans. These results provide support for a steppe origin(9) of at least some of the Indo-European languages of Europe.","Haak, Wolfgang; Lazaridis, Iosif; Patterson, Nick; Rohland, Nadin; Mallick, Swapan; Llamas, Bastien; Brandt, Guido; Nordenfelt, Susanne; Harney, Eadaoin; Stewardson, Kristin; Fu, Qiaomei; Mittnik, Alissa; Banffy, Eszter; Economou, Christos; Francken, Michael; Friederich, Susanne; Pena, Rafael Garrido; Hallgren, Fredrik; Khartanovich, Valery; Khokhlov, Aleksandr; Kunst, Michael; Kuznetsov, Pavel; Meller, Harald; Mochalov, Oleg; Moiseyev, Vayacheslav; Nicklisch, Nicole; Pichler, Sandra L.; Risch, Roberto; Rojo Guerra, Manuel A.; Roth, Christina; Szecsenyi-Nagy, Anna; Wahl, Joachim; Meyer, Matthias; Krause, Johannes; Brown, Dorcas; Anthony, David; Cooper, Alan; Alt, Kurt Werner; Reich, David","Haak, W; Lazaridis, I; Patterson, N; Rohland, N; Mallick, S; Llamas, B; Brandt, G; Nordenfelt, S; Harney, E; Stewardson, K; Fu, QM; Mittnik, A; Banffy, E; Economou, C; Francken, M; Friederich, S; Pena, RG; Hallgren, F; Khartanovich, V; Khokhlov, A; Kunst, M; Kuznetsov, P; Meller, H; Mochalov, O; Moiseyev, V; Nicklisch, N; Pichler, SL; Risch, R; Guerra, MAR; Roth, C; Szecsenyi-Nagy, A; Wahl, J; Meyer, M; Krause, J; Brown, D; Anthony, D; Cooper, A; Alt, KW; Reich, D",207.0,"[Haak, Wolfgang; Llamas, Bastien; Cooper, Alan] Univ Adelaide, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Australian Ctr Ancient DNA, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Haak, Wolfgang; Llamas, Bastien; Cooper, Alan] Univ Adelaide, Inst Environm, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Lazaridis, Iosif; Rohland, Nadin; Mallick, Swapan; Nordenfelt, Susanne; Harney, Eadaoin; Stewardson, Kristin; Fu, Qiaomei; Reich, David] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Lazaridis, Iosif; Patterson, Nick; Rohland, Nadin; Mallick, Swapan; Nordenfelt, Susanne; Harney, Eadaoin; Stewardson, Kristin; Fu, Qiaomei; Reich, David] Broad Inst Harvard & MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Mallick, Swapan; Harney, Eadaoin; Stewardson, Kristin; Reich, David] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Brandt, Guido; Nicklisch, Nicole; Roth, Christina; Szecsenyi-Nagy, Anna; Alt, Kurt Werner] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Anthropol, D-55128 Mainz, Germany; [Fu, Qiaomei; Meyer, Matthias] Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Anthropol, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Fu, Qiaomei] Chinese Acad Sci, IVPP, Key Lab Vertebrate Evolut & Human Origins, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Mittnik, Alissa; Krause, Johannes] Univ Tubingen, Inst Archaeol Sci, D-72070 Tubingen, Germany; [Banffy, Eszter; Szecsenyi-Nagy, Anna] Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Archaeol, Res Ctr Humanities, H-1014 Budapest, Hungary; [Banffy, Eszter] RGK, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany; [Economou, Christos] Stockholm Univ, Archaeol Res Lab, S-11418 Stockholm, Sweden; [Francken, Michael; Krause, Johannes] Univ Tubingen, Senckenberg Ctr Human Evolut & Paleoenvironm, Dept Paleoanthropol, D-72070 Tubingen, Germany; [Francken, Michael; Krause, Johannes] Univ Tubingen, Senckenberg Ctr Human Evolut & Paleoenvironm, Dept Archaeogenet, D-72070 Tubingen, Germany; [Friederich, Susanne; Meller, Harald; Nicklisch, Nicole; Alt, Kurt Werner] Saxony Anhalt & State Museum Prehist, State Off Heritage Management & Archaeol, D-06114 Halle, Germany; [Pena, Rafael Garrido] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Fac Filosofia & Letras, Dept Prehist & Arqueol, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Hallgren, Fredrik] Cultural Heritage Fdn, S-72212 Vasteras, Sweden; [Khartanovich, Valery; Moiseyev, Vayacheslav] Peter Great Museum Anthropol & Ethnog Kunstkamera, St Petersburg 199034, Russia; [Khokhlov, Aleksandr; Kuznetsov, Pavel; Mochalov, Oleg] Volga State Acad Social Sci & Humanities, Samara 443099, Russia; [Kunst, Michael] Deutsch Archaeol Inst, Abt Madrid, E-28002 Madrid, Spain; [Nicklisch, Nicole; Alt, Kurt Werner] Danube Private Univ, A-3500 Krems, Austria; [Pichler, Sandra L.; Alt, Kurt Werner] Univ Basel, Inst Prehist & Archaeol Sci, CH-4003 Basel, Switzerland; [Risch, Roberto] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Prehist, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Rojo Guerra, Manuel A.] Univ Valladolid, Dept Prehist & Arqueol, E-47002 Valladolid, Spain; [Wahl, Joachim] State Off Cultural Heritage Management Baden Wurt, D-78467 Constance, Germany; [Krause, Johannes] Max Planck Inst Sci Human Hist, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Brown, Dorcas; Anthony, David] Hartwick Coll, Dept Anthropol, Oneonta, NY 13820 USA",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14317,Article,1476-4687,reich@genetics.med.harvard.edu,+,"Australian Research Council [DP130102158]; German Research Foundation [Al 287/7-1, 7-3, Al 287/10-1, Al 287/14-1, Me 3245/1-1, 1-3]; US National Science Foundation HOMINID grant [BCS-1032255]; US National Institutes of Health [GM100233]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute","We thank P.

23,41,381.0,"In vertebrate oocytes, meiotic progression is driven by the sequential translational activation of maternal messenger RNAs stored in the cytoplasm. This activation is mainly induced by the cytoplasmic elongation of their poly( A) tails, which is mediated by the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element ( CPE) present in their 39 untranslated regions(1,2). In Xenopus oocytes, sequential phase-specific translation of CPE- regulated mRNAs is required to activate the maturation- promoting factor, which in turn mediates entry into the two consecutive meiotic metaphases ( MI and MII)(3-6). Here we report a genome- wide functional screening to identify previously unknown mRNAs cytoplasmically polyadenylated at meiotic phase transitions. A significant fraction of transcripts containing, in addition to CPEs, ( A+U)- rich element ( ARE) sequences ( characteristic of mRNAs regulated by deadenylation(7)) were identified. Among these is the mRNA encoding C3H-4, an ARE- binding protein that we find to accumulate in MI and the ablation of which induces meiotic arrest. Our results suggest that C3H- 4 recruits the CCR4 deadenylase complex to ARE-containing mRNAs and this, in turn, causes shortening of poly( A) tails. We also show that the opposing activities of the CPEs and the AREs define the precise activation times of the mRNAs encoding the anaphase- promoting complex inhibitors Emi1 and Emi2 during distinct phases of the meiotic cycle. Taken together, our results show that an 'early' wave of cytoplasmic polyadenylation activates a negative feedback loop by activating the synthesis of C3H- 4, which in turn would recruit the deadenylase complex to mRNAs containing both CPEs and AREs. This negative feedback loop is required to exit from metaphase into interkinesis and for meiotic progression.","Belloc, Eulalia; Mendez, Raul","Belloc, E; Mendez, R",1017.0,"[Belloc, Eulalia; Mendez, Raul] Pompeu Fabra Univ, Ctr Genom Regulat, Barcelona 08003, Spain",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06809,Article,,raul.mendez@crg.es,U11,,,291PF,,,ANAPHASE-PROMOTING COMPLEX; CYTOSTATIC FACTOR ARREST; XENOPUS OOCYTE MATURATION; ZINC-FINGER PROTEINS; CYTOPLASMIC POLYADENYLATION; MESSENGER-RNA; TRANSLATIONAL CONTROL; POSITIVE FEEDBACK; BINDING PROTEINS; II TRANSITION,7190.0,NATURE,Nature,English,34.0,No,"Mendez, Raul/0000-0002-1952-6905","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",24-Apr,6.0,LONDON,18385675.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,,"Mendez, R (reprint author), Pompeu Fabra Univ, Ctr Genom Regulat, C Dr Aiguader 88, Barcelona 08003, Spain.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,56.0,A deadenylation negative feedback mechanism governs meiotic metaphase arrest,0.0,7.0,WOS:000255208600044,381.0,452,Multidisciplinary Sciences,58,raul,mendez,1424.0,821,male,1.0,Brl2udAAAAAJ,1,"[0, 1474]",40286951,1,10715560,1,Raúl Méndez,Raúl Méndez,0,0
24,62,315.0,"Nearly three-quarters of the growth in global carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels and cement production between 2010 and 2012 occurred in China(1,2). Yet estimates of Chinese emissions remain subject to large uncertainty; inventories of China's total fossil fuel carbon emissions in 2008 differ by 0.3 gigatonnes of carbon, or 15 per cent(1,3-5). The primary sources of this uncertainty are conflicting estimates of energy consumption and emission factors, the latter being uncertain because of very few actual measurements representative of the mix of Chinese fuels. Here we re-evaluate China's carbon emissions using updated and harmonized energy consumption and clinker production data and two new and comprehensive sets of measured emission factors for Chinese coal. We find that total energy consumption in China was 10 per cent higher in 2000-2012 than the value reported by China's national statistics(6), that emission factors for Chinese coal are on average 40 per cent lower than the default values recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(7), and that emissions from China's cement production are 45 per cent less than recent estimates(1,4). Altogether, our revised estimate of China's CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement production is 2.49 gigatonnes of carbon (2 standard deviations = +/-7.3 per cent) in 2013, which is 14 per cent lower than the emissions reported by other prominent inventories(1,4,8). Over the full period 2000 to 2013, our revised estimates are 2.9 gigatonnes of carbon less than previous estimates of China's cumulative carbon emissions(1,4). Our findings suggest that overestimation of China's emissions in 2000-2013 may be larger than China's estimated total forest sink in 1990-2007 (2.66 gigatonnes of carbon)(9) or China's land carbon sink in 2000-2009 (2.6 gigatonnes of carbon)(10).","Liu, Zhu;

25,104,437.0,"Tropical peatlands contain one of the largest pools of terrestrial organic carbon, amounting to about 89,000 teragrams(1) (1 Tg is a billion kilograms). Approximately 65 per cent of this carbon store is in Indonesia, where extensive anthropogenic degradation in the form of deforestation, drainage and fire are converting it into a globally significant source of atmospheric carbon dioxide(1-3). Here we quantify the annual export of fluvial organic carbon from both intact peat swamp forest and peat swamp forest subject to past anthropogenic disturbance. We find that the total fluvial organic carbon flux from disturbed peat swamp forest is about 50 per cent larger than that from intact peat swamp forest. By carbon-14 dating of dissolved organic carbon (which makes up over 91 per cent of total organic carbon), we find that leaching of dissolved organic carbon from intact peat swamp forest is derived mainly from recent primary production (plant growth). In contrast, dissolved organic carbon from disturbed peat swamp forest consists mostly of much older (centuries to millennia) carbon from deep within the peat column. When we include the fluvial carbon loss term, which is often ignored, in the peatland carbon budget, we find that it increases the estimate of total carbon lost from the disturbed peatlands in our study by 22 per cent. We further estimate that since 1990 peatland disturbance has resulted in a 32 per cent increase in fluvial organic carbon flux from southeast Asia-an increase that is more than half of the entire annual fluvial organic carbon flux from all European peatlands. Our findings emphasize the need to quantify fluvial carbon losses in order to improve estimates of the impact of deforestation and drainage on tropical peatland carbon balances.","Moore, Sam; Evans, Chris D.; Page, Susan E.; Garnett, Mark H.; Jones, Tim G.; Freeman, Chris; Hooijer, Aljosja; Wiltshire, Andrew J.; Limin, Suwido H.; Gauci, Vincent","Moore, S; Evans, CD; Page, SE; Garnett, MH; Jones, TG; Freeman, C; Hooijer, A; Wiltshire, AJ; Limin, SH; Gauci, V",660.0,"[Moore, Sam; Gauci, Vincent] Open Univ, Dept Environm Earth & Ecosyst, CEPSAR, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England; [Evans, Chris D.] Environm Ctr Wales, Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales; [Page, Susan E.] Univ Leicester, Dept Geog, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; [Garnett, Mark H.] Nat Environm Res Council Radiocarbon Facil, E Kilbride G75 0QF, Lanark, Scotland; [Jones, Tim G.; Freeman, Chris] Bangor Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales; [Hooijer, Aljosja] Deltares, NL-2600 MH Delft, Netherlands; [Wiltshire, Andrew J.] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England; [Limin, Suwido H.] Univ Palangka Raya, CIMTROP, Palangka Raya 73112, Central Kaliman, Indonesia",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11818,Article,1476-4687,v.gauci@open.ac.uk,+,"NERC [NE/F008813/1]; Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); Open University (CEPSAR) via the NERC Radiocarbon Facility (Environment) [1323.1008, 15.91]; DECC/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Programme [GA01101]; Royal Society; British Council","S.M. was supported by a NERC PhD studentship (NE/F008813/1).

26,13,299.0,"The most distant quasars known, at redshifts z approximate to 6, generally have properties indistinguishable from those of lower-redshift quasars in the rest-frame ultraviolet/optical and X-ray bands(1-3). This puzzling result suggests that these distant quasars are evolved objects even though the Universe was only seven per cent of its current age at these redshifts. Recently one z approximate to 6 quasar was shown not to have any detectable emission from hot dust(4), but it was unclear whether that indicated different hot-dust properties at high redshift or if it is simply an outlier. Here we report the discovery of a second quasar without hot-dust emission in a sample of 21 z approximate to 6 quasars. Such apparently hot-dust-free quasars have no counterparts at low redshift. Moreover, we demonstrate that the hot-dust abundance in the 21 quasars builds up in tandem with the growth of the central black hole, whereas at low redshift it is almost independent of the black hole mass. Thus z approximate to 6 quasars are indeed at an early evolutionary stage, with rapid mass accretion and dust formation. The two hot-dust-free quasars are likely to be first-generation quasars born in dust-free environments and are too young to have formed a detectable amount of hot dust around them.","Jiang, Linhua; Fan, Xiaohui; Brandt, W.

27,30,392.0,"DNA sequence information underpins genetic research, enabling discoveries of important biological or medical benefit. Sequencing projects have traditionally used long ( 400 - 800 base pair) reads, but the existence of reference sequences for the human and many other genomes makes it possible to develop new, fast approaches to re- sequencing, whereby shorter reads are compared to a reference to identify intraspecies genetic variation. Here we report an approach that generates several billion bases of accurate nucleotide sequence per experiment at low cost. Single molecules of DNA are attached to a flat surface, amplified in situ and used as templates for synthetic sequencing with fluorescent reversible terminator deoxyribonucleotides. Images of the surface are analysed to generate high- quality sequence. We demonstrate application of this approach to human genome sequencing on flow- sorted X chromosomes and then scale the approach to determine the genome sequence of a male Yoruba from Ibadan, Nigeria. We build an accurate consensus sequence from. 303 average depth of paired 35- base reads. We characterize four million single- nucleotide polymorphisms and four hundred thousand structural variants, many of which were previously unknown.

28,121,153.0,"Understanding the dynamics of correlated many-body quantum systems is a challenge for modern physics. Owing to the simplicity of theirHamiltonians, He-4 (bosons) and He-3 (fermions) have served as model systems for strongly interacting quantum fluids, with substantial efforts devoted to their understanding. An important milestone was the direct observation of the collective phonon-roton mode in liquid He-4 by neutron scattering, verifying Landau's prediction(1) and his fruitful concept of elementary excitations. In a Fermi system, collective density fluctuations (known as 'zero-sound' in He-3, and 'plasmons' in charged systems) and incoherent particle-hole excitations are observed. At small wavevectors and energies, both types of excitation are described by Landau's theory of Fermi liquids(2,3). At higher wavevectors, the collectivemode enters the particle-hole band, where it is strongly damped. The dynamics of Fermi liquids at high wavevectors was thus believed to be essentially incoherent. Here we report inelastic neutron scattering measurements of a monolayer of liquid He-3, observing a roton-like excitation. We find that the collective density mode reappears as a well defined excitation atmomentum transfers larger than twice the Fermi momentum. We thus observe unexpected collective behaviour of a Fermi many-body system in the regime beyond the scope of Landau's theory. A satisfactory interpretation of the measured spectra is obtained using a dynamic many-body theory(4).","Godfrin, Henri; Meschke, Matthias; Lauter, Hans-Jochen; Sultan, Ahmad; Boehm, Helga M.; Krotscheck, Eckhard; Panholzer, Martin","Godfrin, H; Meschke, M; Lauter, HJ; Sultan, A; Bohm, HM; Krotscheck, E; Panholzer, M",576.0,"[Godfrin, Henri; Meschke, Matthias; Sultan, Ahmad] CNRS, Inst Neel, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France; [Godfrin, Henri; Meschke, Matthias; Sultan, Ahmad] Univ Grenoble 1, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France; [Meschke, Matthias] Aalto Univ, Low Temp Lab, Aalto 00076, Finland; [Lauter, Hans-Jochen] Inst Laue Langevin, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France; [Lauter, Hans-Jochen] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Boehm, Helga M.; Krotscheck, Eckhard; Panholzer, Martin] Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Inst Theoret Phys, A-4040 Linz, Austria; [Krotscheck, Eckhard] SUNY Buffalo, Dept Phys, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10919,Article,,henri.godfrin@grenoble.cnrs.fr,579,Austrian Fonds zur Forderung der wissenschaftlichen Forschung (FWF) [P21264]; French Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-2010-INTB-403-01]; EU [228464],"We are grateful to the Austrian-French programme Amadeus for providing initial support; to the Austrian Fonds zur Forderung der wissenschaftlichen Forschung (FWF grant P21264), the French Agence Nationale de la Recherche (project ANR-2010-INTB-403-01) and the EU FRP7 low-temperature infrastructure grant Microkelvin (project number 228464) for funding this research; and to the Institut Laue-Langevin for use of the facility.",915EF,,,ELEMENTARY EXCITATIONS; EFFECTIVE-MASS; NEUTRON-SCATTERING; SPIN FLUCTUATIONS; ZERO SOUND; HE-3; FILMS; PLASMONS; GRAPHITE; DYNAMICS,7391.0,NATURE,Nature,English,31.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",29-Mar,4.0,LONDON,22460903.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2012.0,"Meschke, Matthias/G-5166-2012","Godfrin, H (reprint author), CNRS, Inst Neel, BP 166, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,17.0,Observation of a roton collective mode in a two-dimensional Fermi liquid,5.0,40.0,WOS:000302006100034,153.0,483,Multidisciplinary Sciences,17,martin,panholzer,118.0,3568,male,1.0,oDRnEUgAAAAJ,1,"[0, 1474]",143848,1,143848,1,List of suicides,List of suicides,0,0
29,87,435.0,"The geochemistry of Martian meteorites provides a wealth of information about the solid planet and the surface and atmospheric processes that occurred on Mars. The degree to which Martian magmas may have assimilated crustal material, thus altering the geochemical signatures acquired from their mantle sources, is unclear(1). This issue features prominently in efforts to understand whether the source of light rare-earth elements in enriched shergottites lies in crustal material incorporated into melts(1,2) or in mixing between enriched and depleted mantle reservoirs(3). Sulphur isotope systematics offer insight into some aspects of crustal assimilation. The presence of igneous sulphides in Martian meteorites with sulphur isotope signatures indicative of mass-independent fractionation suggests the assimilation of sulphur both during passage of magmas through the crust of Mars and at sites of emplacement. Here we report isotopic analyses of 40 Martian meteorites that represent more than half of the distinct known Martian meteorites, including 30 shergottites (28 plus 2 pairs, where pairs are separate fragments of a single meteorite), 8 nakhlites (5 plus 3 pairs), Allan Hills 84001 and Chassigny. Our data provide strong evidence that assimilation of sulphur into Martian magmas was a common occurrence throughout much of the planet's history. The signature of mass-independent fractionation observed also indicates that the atmospheric imprint of photochemical processing preserved in Martian meteoritic sulphide and sulphate is distinct from that observed in terrestrial analogues, suggesting fundamental differences between the dominant sulphur chemistry in the atmosphere of Mars and that in the atmosphere of Earth(4).","Franz, Heather B.; Kim, Sang-Tae; Farquhar, James; Day, James M.

30,72,76.0,"Transmission spectroscopy has so far detected atomic and molecular absorption in Jupiter-sized exoplanets, but intense efforts to measure molecular absorption in the atmospheres of smaller (Neptune-sized) planets during transits have revealed only featureless spectra(1-4). From this it was concluded that the majority of small, warm planets evolve to sustain atmospheres with high mean molecular weights (little hydrogen), opaque clouds or scattering hazes, reducing our ability to observe the composition of these atmospheres(1-5). Here we report observations of the transmission spectrum of the exoplanet HAT-P-11b (which has a radius about four times that of Earth) from the optical wavelength range to the infrared. We detected water vapour absorption at a wavelength of 1.4 micrometres. The amplitude of the water absorption (approximately 250 parts per million) indicates that the planetary atmosphere is predominantly clear down to an altitude corresponding to about 1 millibar, and sufficiently rich in hydrogen to have a large scale height (over which the atmospheric pressure varies by a factor of e). The spectrum is indicative of a planetary atmosphere in which the abundance of heavy elements is no greater than about 700 times the solar value. This is in good agreement with the core-accretion theory of planet formation, in which a gas giant planet acquires its atmosphere by accreting hydrogen-rich gas directly from the protoplanetary nebula onto a large rocky or icy core(6).","Fraine, Jonathan; Deming, Drake; Benneke, Bjorn; Knutson, Heather; Jordan, Andres; Espinoza, Nestor; Madhusudhan, Nikku; Wilkins, Ashlee; Todorov, Kamen","Fraine, J; Deming, D; Benneke, B; Knutson, H; Jordan, A; Espinoza, N; Madhusudhan, N; Wilkins, A; Todorov, K",526.0,"[Fraine, Jonathan; Deming, Drake; Wilkins, Ashlee] Univ Maryland, Dept Astron, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Fraine, Jonathan; Jordan, Andres; Espinoza, Nestor] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Astrofis, Santiago 7820436, Chile; [Fraine, Jonathan; Benneke, Bjorn; Knutson, Heather] CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Deming, Drake] NASA, Astrobiol Inst Virtual Planetary Lab, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Madhusudhan, Nikku] Univ Cambridge, Inst Astron, Cambridge CB3 0HA, England; [Todorov, Kamen] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Phys, CH-8049 Zurich, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13785,Article,1476-4687,jfraine@astro.umd.edu,+,"'Millennium Institute of Astrophysics (MAS)' of the Millennium Science Initiative, Chilean Ministry of Economy [IC120009]; FONDECYT [1130857]; BASAL CATA [PFB-06]; CONICYT-PCHA/Doctorado Nacional","J.F., A.J. and N.E. acknowledge support from project IC120009 'Millennium Institute of Astrophysics (MAS)' of the Millennium Science Initiative, Chilean Ministry of Economy; FONDECYT project 1130857; and BASAL CATA PFB-06.

31,40,112.0,"Most eukaryotic genes are interrupted by non- coding introns that must be accurately removed from pre- messenger RNAs to produce translatable mRNAs(1). Splicing is guided locally by short conserved sequences, but genes typically contain many potential splice sites, and the mechanisms specifying the correct sites remain poorly understood. In most organisms, short introns recognized by the intron definition mechanism(2) cannot be efficiently predicted solely on the basis of sequence motifs(3). In multicellular eukaryotes, long introns are recognized through exon definition(2) and most genes produce multiple mRNA variants through alternative splicing(4). The nonsense- mediated mRNA decay(5,6) ( NMD) pathway may further shape the observed sets of variants by selectively degrading those containing premature termination codons, which are frequently produced in mammals(7,8). Here we show that the tiny introns of the ciliate Paramecium tetraurelia are under strong selective pressure to cause premature termination of mRNA translation in the event of intron retention, and that the same bias is observed among the short introns of plants, fungi and animals. By knocking down the two P. tetraurelia genes encoding UPF1, a protein that is crucial in NMD, we show that the intrinsic efficiency of splicing varies widely among introns and that NMD activity can significantly reduce the fraction of unspliced mRNAs. The results suggest that, independently of alternative splicing, species with large intron numbers universally rely on NMD to compensate for suboptimal splicing efficiency and accuracy.","Jaillon, Olivier; Bouhouche, Khaled; Gout, Jean-Francois; Aury, Jean-Marc; Noel, Benjamin; Saudemont, Baptiste; Nowacki, Mariusz; Serrano, Vincent; Porcel, Betina M.; Segurens, Beatrice; Le Mouel, Anne; Lepere, Gersende; Schachter, Vincent; Betermier, Mireille; Cohen, Jean; Wincker, Patrick; Sperling, Linda; Duret, Laurent; Meyer, Eric","Jaillon, O; Bouhouche, K; Gout, JF; Aury, JM; Noel, B; Saudemont, B; Nowacki, M; Serrano, V; Porcel, BM; Segurens, B; Le Mouel, A; Lepere, G; Schachter, V; Betermier, M; Cohen, J; Wincker, P; Sperling, L; Duret, L; Meyer, E",359.0,"[Bouhouche, Khaled; Saudemont, Baptiste; Nowacki, Mariusz; Serrano, Vincent; Le Mouel, Anne; Lepere, Gersende; Meyer, Eric] Ecole Normale Super, Genet Mol Lab, F-75005 Paris, France; [Jaillon, Olivier; Aury, Jean-Marc; Noel, Benjamin; Porcel, Betina M.; Segurens, Beatrice; Schachter, Vincent; Wincker, Patrick] Genoscope CEA, F-91057 Evry, France; [Jaillon, Olivier; Aury, Jean-Marc; Noel, Benjamin; Porcel, Betina M.; Schachter, Vincent; Wincker, Patrick] CNRS, UMR 8030, F-91057 Evry, France; [Jaillon, Olivier; Aury, Jean-Marc; Noel, Benjamin; Porcel, Betina M.; Schachter, Vincent; Wincker, Patrick] Univ Evry, F-91057 Evry, France; [Bouhouche, Khaled; Saudemont, Baptiste; Nowacki, Mariusz; Serrano, Vincent; Le Mouel, Anne; Lepere, Gersende; Meyer, Eric] CNRS, UMR 8541, F-75005 Paris, France; [Bouhouche, Khaled; Betermier, Mireille; Cohen, Jean; Sperling, Linda] CNRS, Ctr Genet Mol, UPR 2167, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Bouhouche, Khaled; Betermier, Mireille; Cohen, Jean; Sperling, Linda] Univ Paris 11, F-91405 Orsay, France; [Bouhouche, Khaled; Betermier, Mireille; Cohen, Jean; Sperling, Linda] Univ Paris 06, F-75005 Paris, France; [Gout, Jean-Francois; Duret, Laurent] Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, UMR 5558, Lab Biometrie & Biol Evolut, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06495,Article,,emeyer@biologie.ens.fr,U15,,,252FJ,,,MESSENGER-RNA DECAY; NONSENSE-MEDIATED DECAY; PARAMECIUM-TETRAURELIA; PROTEIN-SYNTHESIS; GENOME BROWSER; FRAME; UCSC; TRANSCRIPTION; INTERFERENCE; RECOGNITION,7176.0,NATURE,Nature,English,39.0,No,"Nowacki, Mariusz/0000-0003-4894-2905; Duret, Laurent/0000-0003-2836-3463; AURY, Jean-Marc/0000-0003-1718-3010; lepere, gersende/0000-0002-4609-7587; Sperling, Linda/0000-0002-7772-4774; Meyer, Eric/0000-0002-3161-8597","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",17-Jan,5.0,LONDON,18202663.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,"Nowacki, Mariusz/E-4485-2011; Sperling, Linda/C-9734-2014","Meyer, E (reprint author), Ecole Normale Super, Genet Mol Lab, 46 Rue Ulm, F-75005 Paris, France.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,123.0,Translational control of intron splicing in eukaryotes,0.0,20.0,WOS:000252432100055,112.0,451,Multidisciplinary Sciences,126,eric,meyer,1784.0,4110,male,1.0,2AvG0z0AAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
32,113,398.0,"Sodium/proton (Na+/H+) antiporters, located at the plasma membrane in every cell, are vital for cell homeostasis1. In humans, their dysfunction has been linked to diseases, such as hypertension, heart failure and epilepsy, and they are well-established drug targets(2). The best understood model system for Na+/H+ antiport is NhaA from Escherichia coli(1,3), for which both electron microscopy and crystal structures are available(4-6). NhaA is made up of two distinct domains: a core domain and a dimerization domain. In the NhaA crystal structure a cavity is located between the two domains, providing access to the ion-binding site from the inward-facing surface of the protein(1,4). Likemany Na+/H+ antiporters, the activity of NhaA is regulated by pH, only becoming active above pH 6.5, at which point a conformational change is thought to occur(7). The only reported NhaA crystal structure so far is of the low pH inactivated form(4). Here we describe the active-state structure of a Na+/H+ antiporter, NapA from Thermus thermophilus, at 3 angstrom resolution, solved from crystals grown at pH7.8. In the NapA structure, the core and dimerization domains are in different positions to those seen in NhaA, and a negatively charged cavity has now opened to the outside. The extracellular cavity allows access to a strictly conserved aspartate residue thought to coordinate ion binding(1,8,9) directly, a role supported hereby molecular dynamics simulations. To alternate access to this ion-binding site, however, requires a surprisingly large rotation of the core domain, some 20 degrees against the dimerization interface. We conclude that despite their fast transport rates of up to 1,500 ions per second(3), Na+/H+ antiporters operate by a two-domain rocking bundle model, revealing themes relevant to secondary-active transporters in general.","Lee, Chiara; Kang, Hae Joo; von Ballmoos, Christoph; Newstead, Simon; Uzdavinys, Povilas; Dotson, David L.; Iwata, So; Beckstein, Oliver; Cameron, Alexander D.; Drew, David","Lee, C; Kang, HJ; von Ballmoos, C; Newstead, S; Uzdavinys, P; Dotson, DL; Iwata, S; Beckstein, O; Cameron, AD; Drew, D",573.0,"[Lee, Chiara; Kang, Hae Joo; Newstead, Simon; Iwata, So; Cameron, Alexander D.; Drew, David] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Div Mol Biosci, London SW7 2AZ, England; [von Ballmoos, Christoph; Uzdavinys, Povilas; Drew, David] Stockholm Univ, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Ctr Biomembrane Res, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Dotson, David L.; Beckstein, Oliver] Arizona State Univ, Dept Phys, Ctr Biol Phys, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Iwata, So; Cameron, Alexander D.] Membrane Prot Lab, Diamond Light Source, Chilton OX11 0DE, Oxon, England; [Iwata, So; Cameron, Alexander D.] Rutherford Appleton Lab, Didcot OX11 0FA, Oxon, England; [Cameron, Alexander D.] Univ Warwick, Sch Life Sci, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12484,Article,,a.cameron@warwick.ac.uk; d.drew@imperial.ac.uk,+,Medical Research Council (MRC) [G0900990]; Swedish Research Council; BBSRC [BB/G02325/1]; Wellcome Trust at the Diamond Light Source Limited [062164/Z/00/Z]; Centre for Biomembrane Research (CBR); Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research; XSEDE [TG-MCB120151]; Human Frontiers Science Program (HFSP); Royal Society through the University Research Fellow (URF) scheme,"We are grateful to D.

33,23,36.0,"Very massive stars shed much of their mass in violent precursor eruptions(1) as luminous blue variables(2) ( LBVs) before reaching their most likely end as supernovae, but the cause of LBV eruptions is unknown. The nineteenth- century eruption of eta Carinae, the prototype of these events(3), ejected about 12 solar masses at speeds of 650 km s(-1), with a kinetic energy of almost 10(50) erg ( ref. 4). Some faster material with speeds up to 1,000 2,000 km s(-1) had previously been reported(5-8) but its full distribution was unknown. Here I report observations of much faster material with speeds up to 3,500-6,000 km s(-1), reaching farther from the star than the fastest material in previous reports(5). This fast material roughly doubles the kinetic energy of the nineteenth-century event and suggests that it released a blast wave now propagating ahead of the massive ejecta. As a result, eta Carinae's outer shell now mimics a low- energy supernova remnant. The eruption has usually been discussed in terms of an extreme wind driven by the star's luminosity(2,3,9,10), but the fast material reported here indicates that it may have been powered by a deep- seated explosion rivalling a supernova, perhaps triggered by the pulsational pair instability(11). This may alter interpretations of similar events seen in other galaxies.","Smith, Nathan","Smith, N",201.0,"[Smith, Nathan] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Astron, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07269,Article,,nathans@astro.berkeley.edu,203,,,346SZ,,,HOMUNCULUS-NEBULA; POPULATION-III; HIGH-VELOCITY; MASSIVE STAR; OUTER SHELL; SPECTROSCOPY; DISCOVERY; EMISSION; ANALOG; SHAPE,7210.0,NATURE,Nature,English,29.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",11-Sep,3.0,LONDON,18784719.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,,"Smith, N (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Astron, 601 Campbell Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,51.0,A blast wave from the 1843 eruption of eta Carinae,0.0,2.0,WOS:000259090800041,36.0,455,Multidisciplinary Sciences,51,nathan,smith,1657.0,1632,male,1.0,a8aBqP8AAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
34,102,110.0,"To resolve the mechanisms that switch competition to cooperation is key to understanding biological organization(1). This is particularly relevant for intrasexual competition, which often leads to males harming females(2). Recent theory proposes that kin selection may modulate female harm by relaxing competition among male relatives(3-5). Here we experimentally manipulate the relatedness of groups of male Drosophila melanogaster competing over females to demonstrate that, as expected, within-group relatedness inhibits male competition and female harm. Females exposed to groups of three brothers unrelated to the female had higher lifetime reproductive success and slower reproductive ageing compared to females exposed to groups of three males unrelated to each other. Triplets of brothers also fought less with each other, courted females less intensively and lived longer than triplets of unrelated males. However, associations among brothers may be vulnerable to invasion by minorities of unrelated males: when two brothers were matched with an unrelated male, the unrelated male sired on average twice as many offspring as either brother. These results demonstrate that relatedness can profoundly affect fitness through its modulation of intrasexual competition, as flies plastically adjust sexual behaviour in a manner consistent with kin-selection theory.","Carazo, Pau; Tan, Cedric K.

The basis for this characteristic timescale of origination, extinction and turnover is not well understood. Various studies have invoked climate change to explain mammalian species turnover(3,4), but other studies have either challenged or only partly confirmed the climate-turnover hypothesis(5-7). Here we use an exceptionally long (24.5-2.5 Myr ago), dense, and well-dated terrestrial record of rodent lineages from central Spain, and show the existence of turnover cycles with periods of 2.4-2.5 and 1.0 Myr. We link these cycles to low-frequency modulations of Milankovitch oscillations(8), and show that pulses of turnover occur at minima of the 2.37-Myr eccentricity cycle and nodes of the 1.2-Myr obliquity cycle. Because obliquity nodes and eccentricity minima are associated with ice sheet expansion and cooling and affect regional precipitation, we infer that long-period astronomical climate forcing is a major determinant of species turnover in small mammals and probably other groups as well.","van Dam, Jan A.; Abdul Aziz, Hayfaa; Sierra, M.

38,11,73.0,"Ecological interactions are crucial to understanding both the ecology and the evolution of organisms(1,2). Because the phenotypic traits regulating species interactions are largely a legacy of their ancestors, it is widely assumed that ecological interactions are phylogenetically conserved, with closely related species interacting with similar partners(2). However, the existing empirical evidence is inadequate to appropriately evaluate the hypothesis of phylogenetic conservatism in ecological interactions, because it is both ecologically and taxonomically biased. In fact, most studies on the evolution of ecological interactions have focused on specialized organisms, such as some parasites or insect herbivores(3-7), belonging to a limited subset of the overall tree of life. Here we study the evolution of host use in a large and diverse group of interactions comprising both specialist and generalist acellular, unicellular and multicellular organisms. We show that, as previously found for specialized interactions, generalized interactions can be evolutionarily conserved. Significant phylogenetic conservatism of interaction patterns was equally likely to occur in symbiotic and non-symbiotic interactions, as well as in mutualistic and antagonistic interactions. Host-use differentiation among species was higher in phylogenetically conserved clades, irrespective of their generalization degree and taxonomic position within the tree of life. Our findings strongly suggest a shared pattern in the organization of biological systems through evolutionary time, mediated by marked conservatism of ecological interactions among taxa.","Gomez, Jose M.; Verdu, Miguel; Perfectti, Francisco","Gomez, JM; Verdu, M; Perfectti, F",918.0,"[Gomez, Jose M.] Univ Granada, Dept Ecol, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Verdu, Miguel] Univ Valencia Generalitat Valenciana, CSIC, Ctr Invest Desertificac, E-46470 Valencia, Spain; [Perfectti, Francisco] Univ Granada, Dept Genet, E-18071 Granada, Spain",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09113,Article,,jmgreyes@ugr.es,U6,Spanish Ministry of Science; Junta de Andalucia,"We thank J.

39,4,229.0,"Many physiological events require transient increases in cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations. Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are ion channels that govern the release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic and sarcoplasmic reticulum(1). Mutations in RyRs can lead to severe genetic conditions that affect both cardiac and skeletal muscle, but locating the mutated residues in the full-length channel structure has been difficult(2,3). Here we show the 2.5 angstrom resolution crystal structure of a region spanning three domains of RyR type 1 (RyR1), encompassing amino acid residues 1-559. The domains interact with each other through a predominantly hydrophilic interface. Docking in RyR1 electron microscopy maps(4,5) unambiguously places the domains in the cytoplasmic portion of the channel, forming a 240-kDa cytoplasmic vestibule around the four-fold symmetry axis. We pinpoint the exact locations of more than 50 disease-associated mutations in full-length RyR1 and RyR2. The mutations can be classified into three groups: those that destabilize the interfaces between the three amino-terminal domains, disturb the folding of individual domains or affect one of six interfaces with other parts of the receptor. We propose a model whereby the opening of a RyR coincides with allosterically coupled motions within the N-terminal domains. This process can be affected by mutations that target various interfaces within and across subunits. The crystal structure provides a framework to understand the many disease-associated mutations in RyRs that have been studied using functional methods, and will be useful for developing new strategies to modulate RyR function in disease states.","Tung, Ching-Chieh; Lobo, Paolo A.; Kimlicka, Lynn; Van Petegem, Filip","Tung, CC; Lobo, PA; Kimlicka, L; Van Petegem, F",585.0,"[Tung, Ching-Chieh; Lobo, Paolo A.; Kimlicka, Lynn; Van Petegem, Filip] Univ British Columbia, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09471,Article,,filip.vanpetegem@gmail.com,U267,Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada,"We thank the staff at beamline 08ID-1 of the Canadian Light source, the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource, K.

40,46,332.0,"Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations were significantly lower during glacial periods than during intervening interglacial periods, but the mechanisms responsible for this difference remain uncertain. Many recent explanations call on greater carbon storage in a poorly ventilated deep ocean during glacial periods(1-5), but direct evidence regarding the ventilation and respired carbon content of the glacial deep ocean is sparse and often equivocal(6). Here we present sedimentary geochemical records from sites spanning the deep subarctic Pacific that-together with previously published results(7)-show that a poorly ventilated water mass containing a high concentration of respired carbon dioxide occupied the North Pacific abyss during the Last Glacial Maximum. Despite an inferred increase in deep Southern Ocean ventilation during the first step of the deglaciation (18,000-15,000 years ago)(4,8), we find no evidence for improved ventilation in the abyssal subarctic Pacific until a rapid transition similar to 14,600 years ago: this change was accompanied by an acceleration of export production from the surface waters above but only a small increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration(8). We speculate that these changes were mechanistically linked to a roughly coeval increase in deep water formation in the North Atlantic(9-11), which flushed respired carbon dioxide from northern abyssal waters, but also increased the supply of nutrients to the upper ocean, leading to greater carbon dioxide sequestration at mid-depths and stalling the rise of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. Our findings are qualitatively consistent with hypotheses invoking a deglacial flushing of respired carbon dioxide from an isolated, deep ocean reservoir(1-5,12), but suggest that the reservoir may have been released in stages, as vigorous deep water ventilation switched between North Atlantic and Southern Ocean source regions.","Galbraith, Eric D.; Jaccard, Samuel L.; Pedersen, Thomas F.; Sigman, Daniel M.; Haug, Gerald H.; Cook, Mea; Southon, John R.; Francois, Roger","Galbraith, ED; Jaccard, SL; Pedersen, TF; Sigman, DM; Haug, GH; Cook, M; Southon, JR; Francois, R",890.0,"Univ British Columbia, Dept Earth & Ocean Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; Univ Victoria, Sch Earth & Ocean Sci, Victoria, BC V8W 3P6, Canada; Princeton Univ, Dept Geosci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; ETH, Inst Geol, Dept Earth Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ocean Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06227,Article,,egalbrai@princeton.edu,U9,,,221LY,,,ATMOSPHERIC CO2 CONCENTRATIONS; SANTA-BARBARA BASIN; DEEP-WATER; AGE CALIBRATION; RADIOCARBON AGE; SOUTHERN-OCEAN; GLACIAL PERIOD; PRODUCTIVITY; CIRCULATION; VENTILATION,7164.0,NATURE,Nature,English,39.0,No,"Sigman, Daniel/0000-0002-7923-1973; Galbraith, Eric/0000-0003-4476-4232; Jaccard, Samuel/0000-0002-5793-0896","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",18-Oct,5.0,LONDON,17943127.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007.0,"Sigman, Daniel/A-2649-2008; Galbraith, Eric/F-9469-2014; Jaccard, Samuel/G-3447-2014","Galbraith, ED (reprint author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Earth & Ocean Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,116.0,Carbon dioxide release from the North Pacific abyss during the last deglaciation,1.0,30.0,WOS:000250230600043,332.0,449,Multidisciplinary Sciences,116,roger,francois,3429.0,1220,male,1.0,wa5soqQAAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",19978989,1,33138,1,Roger François,Roger François,0,0
41,127,79.0,"Any thermodynamically stable or metastable phase corresponds to a local minimum of a potentially very complicated energy landscape. But however complex the crystal might be, this energy landscape is of parabolic shape near its minima. Roughly speaking, the depth of this energy well with respect to some reference level determines the thermodynamic stability of the system, and the steepness of the parabola near its minimum determines the system's elastic properties. Although changing alloying elements and their concentrations in a given material to enhance certain properties dates back to the Bronze Age(1,2), the systematic search for desirable properties in metastable atomic configurations at a fixed stoichiometry is a very recent tool in materials design(3). Here we demonstrate, using first-principles studies of four binary alloy systems, that the elastic properties of face-centred-cubic intermetallic compounds obey certain rules. We reach two conclusions based on calculations on a huge subset of the face-centred-cubic configuration space. First, the stiffness and the heat of formation are negatively correlated with a nearly constant Spearman correlation(4) for all concentrations. Second, the averaged stiffness of metastable configurations at a fixed concentration decays linearly with their distance to the ground-state line (the phase diagram of an alloy at zero Kelvin). We hope that our methods will help to simplify the quest for new materials with optimal properties from the vast configuration space available.","Maisel, Sascha B.; Hoefler, Michaela; Mueller, Stefan","Maisel, SB; Hofler, M; Muller, S",740.0,"[Maisel, Sascha B.; Hoefler, Michaela; Mueller, Stefan] Hamburg Univ Technol, Inst Adv Ceram, D-21073 Hamburg, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11609,Article,1476-4687,stefan.mueller@tuhh.de,+,DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) [Mu1648/5],Funding by the DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) grant Mu1648/5 is acknowledged.

42,116,63.0,"Cell-surface receptors frequently use scaffold proteins to recruit cytoplasmic targets, but the rationale for this is uncertain. Activated receptor tyrosine kinases, for example, engage scaffolds such as Shc1 that contain phosphotyrosine (pTyr)-binding (PTB) domains. Using quantitative mass spectrometry, here we show that mammalian Shc1 responds to epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation through multiple waves of distinct phosphorylation events and protein interactions. After stimulation, Shc1 rapidly binds a group of proteins that activate pro-mitogenic or survival pathways dependent on recruitment of the Grb2 adaptor to Shc1 pTyr sites. Akt-mediated feedback phosphorylation of Shc1 Ser 29 then recruits the Ptpn12 tyrosine phosphatase. This is followed by a sub-network of proteins involved in cytoskeletal reorganization, trafficking and signal termination that binds Shc1 with delayed kinetics, largely through the SgK269 pseudokinase/adaptor protein. Ptpn12 acts as a switch to convert Shc1 from pTyr/Grb2-based signalling to SgK269-mediated pathways that regulate cell invasion and morphogenesis. The Shc1 scaffold therefore directs the temporal flow of signalling information after EGF stimulation.","Zheng, Yong; Zhang, Cunjie; Croucher, David R.; Soliman, Mohamed A.; St-Denis, Nicole; Pasculescu, Adrian; Taylor, Lorne; Tate, Stephen A.; Hardy, W.

43,95,397.0,"Sensory proteins must relay structural signals from the sensory site over large distances to regulatory output domains. Phytochromes are a major family of red-light-sensing kinases that control diverse cellular functions in plants, bacteria and fungi(1-9). Bacterial phytochromes consist of a photosensory core and a carboxy-terminal regulatory domain(10,11). Structures of photosensory cores are reported in the resting state(12-18) and conformational responses to light activation have been proposed in the vicinity of the chromophore(19-23). However, the structure of the signalling state and the mechanism of downstream signal relay through the photosensory core remain elusive. Here we report crystal and solution structures of the resting and activated states of the photosensory core of the bacteriophytochrome from Deinococcus radiodurans. The structures show an open and closed form of the dimeric protein for the activated and resting states, respectively. This nanometre-scale rearrangement is controlled by refolding of an evolutionarily conserved 'tongue', which is in contact with the chromophore. The findings reveal an unusual mechanism in which atomic-scale conformational changes around the chromophore are first amplified into ana angstrom-scale distance change in the tongue, and further grow into a nanometre-scale conformational signal. The structural mechanism is a blueprint for understanding how phytochromes connect to the cellular signalling network.","Takala, Heikki; Bjorling, Alexander; Berntsson, Oskar; Lehtivuori, Heli; Niebling, Stephan; Hoernke, Maria; Kosheleva, Irina; Henning, Robert; Menzel, Andreas; Ihalainen, Janne A.; Westenhoff, Sebastian","Takala, H; Bjorling, A; Berntsson, O; Lehtivuori, H; Niebling, S; Hoernke, M; Kosheleva, I; Henning, R; Menzel, A; Ihalainen, JA; Westenhoff, S",245.0,"[Takala, Heikki; Lehtivuori, Heli; Ihalainen, Janne A.] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Nanosci Ctr, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland; [Takala, Heikki; Bjorling, Alexander; Berntsson, Oskar; Niebling, Stephan; Hoernke, Maria; Westenhoff, Sebastian] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Chem & Mol Biol, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Kosheleva, Irina; Henning, Robert] Univ Chicago, Ctr Adv Radiat Sources, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Menzel, Andreas] Paul Scherrer Inst, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13310,Article,1476-4687,janne.ihalainen@jyu.fi; westenho@chem.gu.se,+,"European Community [312284 CALIPSO]; National Institutes of Health, National Institute of General Medical Sciences [1R24GM111072]; Foundation of Strategic Research, Sweden; Swedish Research Council [279944]; European Research Council [279944]; Finnish Academy [138063]; Finnish Cultural Foundation [0131067]","We acknowledge beamline access at BM29 and ID23-1 at the ESRF, cSAXS at the Swiss Light Source (funded by the European Community's FP7 grant agreement no. 312284 CALIPSO), and BioCARS at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory (supported by National Institutes of Health, National Institute of General Medical Sciences grant 1R24GM111072 and in part through collaboration with P.

Several smaller moonlets and clumps have been detected in the ring's immediate vicinity, and a population of embedded objects has been inferred. Here we report direct evidence of moonlets embedded in the ring's bright core, and show that most of the F ring's morphology results from the continual gravitational and collisional effects of small satellites, often combined with the perturbing effect of Prometheus.

45,133,222.0,"Pregnancy is an intricately orchestrated process where immune effector cells with fetal specificity are selectively silenced. This requires the sustained expansion of immune-suppressive maternal FOXP3(+) regulatory T cells (T-reg cells), because even transient partial ablation triggers fetal-specific effector T-cell activation and pregnancy loss(1,2). In turn, many idiopathic pregnancy complications proposed to originate from disrupted fetal tolerance are associated with blunted maternal T-reg expansion(3-5). Importantly, however, the antigen specificity and cellular origin of maternal Treg cells that accumulate during gestation remain incompletely defined. Here we show that pregnancy selectively stimulates the accumulation of maternal FOXP3(+) CD4 cells with fetal specificity using tetramer-based enrichment that allows the identification of rare endogenous T cells(6). Interestingly, after delivery, fetal-specific T-reg cells persist at elevated levels, maintain tolerance to pre-existing fetal antigen, and rapidly re-accumulate during subsequent pregnancy. The accelerated expansion of T-reg cells during secondary pregnancy was driven almost exclusively by proliferation of fetal-specific FOXP3(+) cells retained from prior pregnancy, whereas induced FOXP3 expression and proliferation of pre-existing FOXP3(+) cells each contribute to T-reg expansion during primary pregnancy. Furthermore, fetal resorption in secondary compared with primary pregnancy becomes more resilient to partial maternal FOXP3(+) cell ablation.

46,32,443.0,"Molecular mechanisms regulating animal seasonal breeding in response to changing photoperiod are not well understood. Rapid induction of gene expression of thyroid- hormone- activating enzyme ( type 2 deiodinase, DIO2) in the mediobasal hypothalamus ( MBH) of the Japanese quail ( Coturnix japonica) is the earliest event yet recorded in the photoperiodic signal transduction pathway. Here we show cascades of gene expression in the quail MBH associated with the initiation of photoinduced secretion of luteinizing hormone. We identified two waves of gene expression. The first was initiated about 14 h after dawn of the first long day and included increased thyrotrophin ( TSH) beta- subunit expression in the pars tuberalis; the second occurred approximately 4 h later and included increased expression of DIO2. Intracerebroventricular ( ICV) administration of TSH to short- day quail stimulated gonadal growth and expression of DIO2 which was shown to be mediated through a TSH receptor - cyclic AMP ( cAMP) signalling pathway. Increased TSH in the pars tuberalis therefore seems to trigger long- day photoinduced seasonal breeding.","Nakao, Nobuhiro; Ono, Hiroko; Yamamura, Takashi; Anraku, Tsubasa; Takagi, Tsuyoshi; Higashi, Kumiko; Yasuo, Shinobu; Katou, Yasuhiro; Kageyama, Saburo; Uno, Yumiko; Kasukawa, Takeya; Iigo, Masayuki; Sharp, Peter J.; Iwasawa, Atsushi; Suzuki, Yutaka; Sugano, Sumio; Niimi, Teruyuki; Mizutani, Makoto; Namikawa, Takao; Ebihara, Shizufumi; Ueda, Hiroki R.; Yoshimura, Takashi","Nakao, N; Ono, H; Yamamura, T; Anraku, T; Takagi, T; Higashi, K; Yasuo, S; Katou, Y; Kageyama, S; Uno, Y; Kasukawa, T; Iigo, M; Sharp, PJ; Iwasawa, A; Suzuki, Y; Sugano, S; Niimi, T; Mizutani, M; Namikawa, T; Ebihara, S; Ueda, HR; Yoshimura, T",317.0,"[Nakao, Nobuhiro; Ono, Hiroko; Yamamura, Takashi; Anraku, Tsubasa; Takagi, Tsuyoshi; Higashi, Kumiko; Yasuo, Shinobu; Katou, Yasuhiro; Kageyama, Saburo; Uno, Yumiko; Ebihara, Shizufumi; Yoshimura, Takashi] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Bioagr Sci, Chikusa Ku, Div Biomodelling, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Kasukawa, Takeya; Ueda, Hiroki R.] RIKEN, Funct Genom Subunit, Ctr Dev Biol, Chuo Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan; [Iigo, Masayuki] Utsunomiya Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Appl Biochem, Utsunomiya, Tochigi 3218505, Japan; [Sharp, Peter J.] Univ Edinburgh, Div Genet & Genom, Roslin Inst, Roslin EH25 9PS, Midlothian, Scotland; [Sharp, Peter J.] Univ Edinburgh, Div Genet & Genom, Royal Dick Sch Vet Studies, Roslin EH25 9PS, Midlothian, Scotland; [Iwasawa, Atsushi] Gifu Univ, Lab Comparat Biochem, Grad Sch Appl Biol Sci, Gifu 5011193, Japan; [Suzuki, Yutaka; Sugano, Sumio] Univ Tokyo, Dept Med Genome Sci, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; [Niimi, Teruyuki] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Bioagr Sci, Chikusa Ku, Div Biofunct Dev, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Mizutani, Makoto; Namikawa, Takao; Ebihara, Shizufumi; Yoshimura, Takashi] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Bioagr Sci, Chikusa Ku, Avian Biosci Res Ctr, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Ueda, Hiroki R.] RIKEN, Lab Syst Biol, Ctr Dev Biol, Chuo Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan; [Yoshimura, Takashi] Nagoya Univ, Chikusa Ku, Inst Adv Res, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06738,Article,,takashiy@agr.nagoya-u.ac.jp,U1,,,276BX,,,II IODOTHYRONINE DEIODINASE; COTURNIX-COTURNIX-JAPONICA; JAPANESE-QUAIL; CHICKEN THYROTROPIN; GENE-EXPRESSION; CIRCADIAN CLOCK; BETA-SUBUNIT; HORMONE; RECEPTOR; BRAIN,7185.0,NATURE,Nature,English,39.0,No,"Yoshimura, Takashi/0000-0001-7018-9652; Kasukawa, Takeya/0000-0001-5085-0802","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",20-Mar,7.0,LONDON,18354476.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,"Yoshimura, Takashi/C-8306-2012; Ueda, Hiroki/C-5037-2014; Kasukawa, Takeya/N-5070-2015","Yoshimura, T (reprint author), Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Bioagr Sci, Chikusa Ku, Div Biomodelling, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,233.0,Thyrotrophin in the pars tuberalis triggers photoperiodic response,0.0,48.0,WOS:000254117400039,443.0,452,Multidisciplinary Sciences,240,takashi,yoshimura,2197.0,16,male,1.0,70uGLR0AAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",34529736,1,18969,1,Tempest 3D,Tempest 3D,0,0
47,144,270.0,"G-protein-coupled receptors are the largest class of cell-surface receptors, and these membrane proteins exist in equilibrium between inactive and active states(1-13). Conformational changes induced by extracellular ligands binding to G-protein-coupled receptors result in a cellular response through the activation of G proteins. The A(2A) adenosine receptor (A(2A)AR) is responsible for regulating blood flow to the cardiac muscle and is important in the regulation of glutamate and dopamine release in the brain(14). Here we report the raising of a mouse monoclonal antibody against human A(2A)AR that prevents agonist but not antagonist binding to the extracellular ligand-binding pocket, and describe the structure of A(2A)AR in complex with the antibody Fab fragment (Fab2838). This structure reveals that Fab2838 recognizes the intracellular surface of A(2A)AR and that its complementarity-determining region, CDR-H3, penetrates into the receptor. CDR-H3 is located in a similar position to the G-protein carboxy-terminal fragment in the active opsin structure(1) and to CDR-3 of the nanobody in the active beta(2)-adrenergic receptor structure(2), but locks A(2A)AR in an inactive conformation.

48,76,423.0,"Massive galaxy clusters are filled with a hot, turbulent and magnetized intra-cluster medium. Still forming under the action of gravitational instability, they grow in mass by accretion of supersonic flows. These flows partially dissipate into heat through a complex network of large-scale shocks(1), while residual transonic (near-sonic) flows create giant turbulent eddies and cascades(2,3). Turbulence heats the intra-cluster medium(4) and also amplifies magnetic energy by way of dynamo action(5-8). However, the pattern regulating the transformation of gravitational energy into kinetic, thermal, turbulent and magnetic energies remains unknown. Here we report that the energy components of the intra-cluster medium are ordered according to a permanent hierarchy, in which the ratio of thermal to turbulent to magnetic energy densities remains virtually unaltered throughout the cluster's history, despite evolution of each individual component and the drive towards equipartition of the turbulent dynamo. This result revolves around the approximately constant efficiency of turbulence generation from the gravitational energy that is freed during mass accretion, revealed by our computational model of cosmological structure formation(3,9). The permanent character of this hierarchy reflects yet another type of self-similarity in cosmology(10-13), while its structure, consistent with current data(14-18), encodes information about the efficiency of turbulent heating and dynamo action.","Miniati, Francesco; Beresnyak, Andrey","Miniati, F; Beresnyak, A",59.0,"[Miniati, Francesco] ETH, Dept Phys, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Beresnyak, Andrey] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Nordita, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Beresnyak, Andrey] Stockholm Univ, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14552,Article,1476-4687,fm@phys.ethz.ch,+,"Swiss National Supercomputing Center (CSCS) [S419, S506]",This work was supported by a grant from the Swiss National Supercomputing Center (CSCS) under project IDs S419 and S506.,CL7RN,,,LARGE-SCALE STRUCTURE; SEED MAGNETIC-FIELDS; TURBULENT MOTIONS; ROTATION MEASURES; POWER SPECTRUM; ADAPTIVE MESH; SHOCK-WAVES; REFINEMENT; GENERATION; STATISTICS,7558.0,NATURE,Nature,English,36.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2-Jul,7.0,LONDON,26135447.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2015.0,,"Miniati, F (reprint author), ETH, Dept Phys, Wolfgang Pauli Str 27, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,18.0,Self-similar energetics in large clusters of galaxies,2.0,19.0,WOS:000357169500030,423.0,523,Multidisciplinary Sciences,18,andrey,beresnyak,1503.0,147,male,0.99,RTuSgmUAAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0

The hydrophilic V-1 portion is known as a rotary motor, in which a central axis DF complex rotates inside a hexagonally arranged catalytic A(3)B(3) complex using ATP hydrolysis energy, but the molecular mechanism is not well defined owing to a lack of high-resolution structural information. We previously reported on the in vitro expression, purification and reconstitution of Enterococcus hirae V-1-ATPase from the A(3)B(3) and DF complexes(2,3). Here we report the asymmetric structures of the nucleotide-free (2.8 angstrom) and nucleotide-bound (3.4 angstrom) A(3)B(3) complex that demonstrate conformational changes induced by nucleotide binding, suggesting a binding order in the right-handed rotational orientation in a cooperative manner. The crystal structures of the nucleotide-free (2.2 angstrom) and nucleotide-bound (2.7 angstrom) V-1-ATPase are also reported. The more tightly packed nucleotide-binding site seems to be induced by DF binding, and ATP hydrolysis seems to be stimulated by the approach of a conserved arginine residue.

50,66,169.0,"Over a century of research into the origin of turbulence in wall-bounded shear flows has resulted in a puzzling picture in which turbulence appears in a variety of different states competing with laminar background flow(1-6). At moderate flow speeds, turbulence is confined to localized patches; it is only at higher speeds that the entire flow becomes turbulent. The origin of the different states encountered during this transition, the front dynamics of the turbulent regions and the transformation to full turbulence have yet to be explained. By combining experiments, theory and computer simulations, here we uncover a bifurcation scenario that explains the transformation to fully turbulent pipe flow and describe the front dynamics of the different states encountered in the process. Key to resolving this problem is the interpretation of the flow as a bistable system with nonlinear propagation (advection) of turbulent fronts. These findings bridge the gap between our understanding of the onset of turbulence(7) and fully turbulent flows(8,9).","Barkley, Dwight; Song, Baofang; Mukund, Vasudevan; Lemoult, Gregoire; Avila, Marc; Hof, Bjoern","Barkley, D; Song, BF; Mukund, V; Lemoult, G; Avila, M; Hof, B",550.0,"[Barkley, Dwight] Univ Warwick, Inst Math, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Song, Baofang; Mukund, Vasudevan; Lemoult, Gregoire; Hof, Bjoern] IST Austria, A-3400 Klosterneuburg, Austria; [Song, Baofang] Max Planck Inst Dynam & Self Org, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Song, Baofang] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Inst Multiscale Simulat, D-91052 Erlangen, Germany; [Avila, Marc] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Inst Fluid Mech, D-91058 Erlangen, Germany",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15701,Article,1476-4687,D.Barkley@warwick.ac.uk; bhof@ist.ac.at,U191,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [FOR 1182]; European Research Council under the European Union [306589]; Chinese State Scholarship Fund [2010629145]; International Max Planck Research School for the Physics of Biological and Complex Systems; Gottingen Graduate School for Neurosciences and Molecular Biosciences; Julich Supercomputing Centre [HGU16],"We thank A.

52,120,184.0,"Semaphorin 3A (Sema3A) is a diffusible axonal chemorepellent that has an important role in axon guidance(1-5). Previous studies have demonstrated that Sema3a(-/-) mice have multiple developmental defects due to abnormal neuronal innervations(6,7). Here we show in mice that Sema3A is abundantly expressed in bone, and cell-based assays showed that Sema3A affected osteoblast differentiation in a cell-autonomous fashion. Accordingly, Sema3a(-/-) mice had a low bone mass due to decreased bone formation. However, osteoblast-specific Sema3A-deficient mice (Sema3a(coli)(-/-) and Sema3a(osx)(-/-) mice) had normal bone mass, even though the expression of Sema3A in bone was substantially decreased. In contrast, mice lacking Sema3A in neurons (Sema3a(synapsin)(-/-) and Sema3a(nestin)(-/-) mice) had low bone mass, similar to Sema3a(-/-) mice, indicating that neuron-derived Sema3A is responsible for the observed bone abnormalities independent of the local effect of Sema3A in bone. Indeed, the number of sensory innervations of trabecular bone was significantly decreased in Sema3a(synapsin)(-/-) mice, whereas sympathetic innervations of trabecular bone were unchanged. Moreover, ablating sensory nerves decreased bone mass in wild-type mice, whereas it did not reduce the low bone mass in Sema3a(nestin)(-/-) mice further, supporting the essential role of the sensory nervous system in normal bone homeostasis. Finally, neuronal abnormalities in Sema3a(-/-) mice, such as olfactory development, were identified in Sema3a(synasin)(-/-) mice, demonstrating that neuron-derived Sema3A contributes to the abnormal neural development seen in Sema3a(-/-) mice, and indicating that Sema3A produced in neurons regulates neural development in an autocrine manner. This study demonstrates that Sema3A regulates bone remodelling indirectly by modulating sensory nerve development, but not directly by acting on osteoblasts.","Fukuda, Toru; Takeda, Shu; Xu, Ren; Ochi, Hiroki; Sunamura, Satoko; Sato, Tsuyoshi; Shibata, Shinsuke; Yoshida, Yutaka; Gu, Zirong; Kimura, Ayako; Ma, Chengshan; Xu, Cheng; Bando, Waka; Fujita, Koji; Shinomiya, Kenichi; Hirai, Takashi; Asou, Yoshinori; Enomoto, Mitsuhiro; Okano, Hideyuki; Okawa, Atsushi; Itoh, Hiroshi","Fukuda, T; Takeda, S; Xu, R; Ochi, H; Sunamura, S; Sato, T; Shibata, S; Yoshida, Y; Gu, ZR; Kimura, A; Ma, CS; Xu, C; Bando, W; Fujita, K; Shinomiya, K; Hirai, T; Asou, Y; Enomoto, M; Okano, H; Okawa, A; Itoh, H",490.0,"[Fukuda, Toru; Takeda, Shu; Ochi, Hiroki; Sunamura, Satoko] Keio Univ, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, Shinjyuku Ku, Tokyo 1608582, Japan; [Xu, Ren; Kimura, Ayako; Ma, Chengshan; Xu, Cheng; Fujita, Koji; Shinomiya, Kenichi; Hirai, Takashi; Asou, Yoshinori; Enomoto, Mitsuhiro; Okawa, Atsushi] Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Dept Orthoped Surg, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138549, Japan; [Xu, Ren; Ma, Chengshan; Xu, Cheng; Fujita, Koji; Okawa, Atsushi] Int Res Ctr Mol Sci Tooth & Bone Dis, Global Ctr Excellence GCOE Program, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138549, Japan; [Sato, Tsuyoshi] Saitama Med Univ, Dept Oral & Maxillofacial Surg, Moroyama, Saitama 3500495, Japan; [Shibata, Shinsuke; Okano, Hideyuki] Keio Univ, Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Shinjyuku Ku, Tokyo 1608582, Japan; [Yoshida, Yutaka; Gu, Zirong] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Dev Biol, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Kimura, Ayako] Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Hard Tissue Genome Res Ctr, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138549, Japan; [Bando, Waka; Itoh, Hiroshi] Keio Univ, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, Sect Nephrol Endocrinol & Metab,Shinjyuku Ku, Tokyo 1608582, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12115,Article,,shu-tky@umin.ac.jp,+,Funding Program for Next Generation World-Leading Researchers (NEXT Program); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke [NS065048],"We thank M.

53,136,494.0,"The isotopes Xe-129, produced from the radioactive decay of extinct I-129, and Xe-136, produced from extinct Pu-244 and extant U-238, have provided important constraints on early mantle outgassing and volatile loss from Earth(1,2). The low ratios of radiogenic to non-radiogenic xenon (Xe-129/Xe-130) in ocean island basalts (OIBs) compared with mid-ocean-ridge basalts (MORBs) have been used as evidence for the existence of a relatively undegassed primitive deep-mantle reservoir(1). However, the low Xe-129/Xe-130 ratios in OIBs have also been attributed to mixing between subducted atmospheric Xe and MORB Xe, which obviates the need for a less degassed deep-mantle reservoir(3,4). Here I present new noble gas (He, Ne, Ar, Xe) measurements from an Icelandic OIB that reveal differences in elemental abundances and Ne-20/Ne-22 ratios between the Iceland mantle plume and the MORB source. These observations show that the lower Xe-129/Xe-130 ratios in OIBs are due to a lower I/Xe ratio in the OIB mantle source and cannot be explained solely by mixing atmospheric Xe with MORB-type Xe. Because I-129 became extinct about 100 million years after the formation of the Solar System, OIB and MORB mantle sources must have differentiated by 4.45 billion years ago and subsequent mixing must have been limited. The Iceland plume source also has a higher proportion of Pu- to U-derived fission Xe, requiring the plume source to be less degassed than MORBs, a conclusion that is independent of noble gas concentrations and the partitioning behaviour of the noble gases with respect to their radiogenic parents. Overall, these results show that Earth's mantle accreted volatiles from at least two separate sources and that neither the Moon-forming impact nor 4.45 billion years of mantle convection has erased the signature of Earth's heterogeneous accretion and early differentiation.","Mukhopadhyay, Sujoy","Mukhopadhyay, S",101.0,"Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11141,Article,,sujoy@eps.harvard.edu,U124,NSF [EAR 0911363],"I thank D.

54,122,372.0,"The extinction rate of populations is predicted to rise under increasing rates of environmental change(1-3). If a population experiencing increasingly stressful conditions lacks appropriate phenotypic plasticity or access to more suitable habitats, then genetic change may be the only way to avoid extinction(1). Evolutionary rescue from extinction occurs when natural selection enriches a population for more stress-tolerant genetic variants(1,3). Some experimental studies have shown that lower rates of environmental change lead to more adapted populations or fewer extinctions(4-9). However, there has been little focus on the genetic changes that underlie evolutionary rescue. Here we demonstrate that some evolutionary trajectories are contingent on a lower rate of environmental change. We allowed hundreds of populations of Escherichia coli to evolve under variable rates of increase in concentration of the antibiotic rifampicin. We then genetically engineered all combinations of mutations from isolates evolved under lower rates of environmental change. By assessing fitness of these engineered strains across a range of drug concentrations, we show that certain genotypes are evolutionarily inaccessible under rapid environmental change. Rapidly deteriorating environments not only limit mutational opportunities by lowering population size, but they can also eliminate sets of mutations as evolutionary options. As anthropogenic activities are leading to environmental change at unprecedented rapidity(1), it is critical to understand how the rate of environmental change affects both demographic and genetic underpinnings of evolutionary rescue.","Lindsey, Haley A.; Gallie, Jenna; Taylor, Susan; Kerr, Benjamin","Lindsey, HA; Gallie, J; Taylor, S; Kerr, B",463.0,"[Lindsey, Haley A.; Gallie, Jenna; Taylor, Susan; Kerr, Benjamin] Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Lindsey, Haley A.; Gallie, Jenna; Taylor, Susan; Kerr, Benjamin] Univ Washington, BEACON Ctr Study Evolut Act, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Gallie, Jenna] Eawag, Dept Environm Microbiol, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Gallie, Jenna] ETH, Dept Environm Syst Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11879,Article,1476-4687,kerrb@uw.edu,467,National Science Foundation [DBI-0939454]; NSF CAREER [DEB0952825]; UW Royalty Research Fund [A74107],"We thank T.

55,146,425.0,"Climate change is driving latitudinal and altitudinal shifts in species distribution worldwide(1,2), leading to novel species assemblages(3,4). Lags between these biotic responses and contemporary climate changes have been reported for plants and animals(5). Theoretically, the magnitude of these lags should be greatest in lowland areas, where the velocity of climate change is expected to be much greater than that in highland areas(6). We compared temperature trends to temperatures reconstructed from plant assemblages (observed in 76,634 surveys) over a 44-year period in France (1965-2008). Here we report that forest plant communities had responded to 0.54 degrees C of the effective increase of 1.07 degrees C in highland areas (500-2,600 m above sea level), while they had responded to only 0.02 degrees C of the 1.11 degrees C warming trend in lowland areas. There was a larger temperature lag (by 3.1 times) between the climate and plant community composition in lowland forests than in highland forests. The explanation of such disparity lies in the following properties of lowland, as compared to highland, forests: the higher proportion of species with greater ability for local persistence as the climate warms(7), the reduced opportunity for short-distance escapes(8,9), and the greater habitat fragmentation. Although mountains are currently considered to be among the ecosystems most threatened by climate change (owing to mountaintop extinction), the current inertia of plant communities in lowland forests should also be noted, as it could lead to lowland biotic attrition(10).","Bertrand, Romain; Lenoir, Jonathan; Piedallu, Christian; Riofrio-Dillon, Gabriela; de Ruffray, Patrice; Vidal, Claude; Pierrat, Jean-Claude; Gegout, Jean-Claude","Bertrand, R; Lenoir, J; Piedallu, C; Riofrio-Dillon, G; de Ruffray, P; Vidal, C; Pierrat, JC; Gegout, JC",517.0,"[Bertrand, Romain; Piedallu, Christian; Riofrio-Dillon, Gabriela; Pierrat, Jean-Claude; Gegout, Jean-Claude] AgroParisTech, ENGREF, UMR1092, Lab Etud Ressources Foret Bois LERFoB, F-54000 Nancy, France; [Bertrand, Romain; Piedallu, Christian; Riofrio-Dillon, Gabriela; Pierrat, Jean-Claude; Gegout, Jean-Claude] INRA, Ctr Nancy, UMR1092, Lab Etud Ressources Foret Bois LERFoB, F-54280 Champenoux, France; [Lenoir, Jonathan] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Ecoinformat & Biodivers Grp, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [de Ruffray, Patrice] Univ Strasbourg UDS, Inst Biol Mol Plantes IBMP, CNRS, F-67084 Strasbourg, France; [Vidal, Claude] Inventaire Forestier Natl, F-45290 Nogent Sur Marne, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10548,Article,,romain.bertrand@engref.agroparistech.fr,520,"French Institute of Agricultural, Forest and Environmental Engineering (ENGREF, AgroParisTech); National Forest Department (ONF); French Agency for Environment and Energy Management (ADEME); Danish Council for Independent Research - Natural Sciences [272-07-0242]; ADEME; Regional Council of Lorraine","We thank J.-D.

56,94,353.0,"In the ciliate Paramecium, transposable elements and their single-copy remnants are deleted during the development of somatic macronuclei from germline micronuclei, at each sexual generation. Deletions are targeted by scnRNAs, small RNAs produced from the germ line during meiosis that first scan the maternal macronuclear genome to identify missing sequences, and then allow the zygotic macronucleus to reproduce the same deletions. Here we show that this process accounts for the maternal inheritance of mating types in Paramecium tetraurelia, a long-standing problem in epigenetics. Mating type E depends on expression of the transmembrane protein mtA, and the default type O is determined during development by scnRNA-dependent excision of the mtA promoter. In the sibling species Paramecium septaurelia, mating type O is determined by coding-sequence deletions in a different gene, mtB, which is specifically required for mtA expression. These independently evolved mechanisms suggest frequent exaptation of the scnRNA pathway to regulate cellular genes and mediate transgene-rational epigenetic inheritance of essential phenotypic polymorphisms.","Singh, Deepankar Pratap; Saudemont, Baptiste; Guglielmi, Gerard; Arnaiz, Olivier; Gout, Jean-Francois; Prajer, Malgorzata; Potekhin, Alexey; Przybos, Ewa; Aubusson-Fleury, Anne; Bhullar, Simran; Bouhouche, Khaled; Lhuillier-Akakpo, Maoussi; Tanty, Veronique; Blugeon, Corinne; Alberti, Adriana; Labadie, Karine; Aury, Jean-Marc; Sperling, Linda; Duharcourt, Sandra; Meyer, Eric","Singh, DP; Saudemont, B; Guglielmi, G; Arnaiz, O; Gout, JF; Prajer, M; Potekhin, A; Przybos, E; Aubusson-Fleury, A; Bhullar, S; Bouhouche, K; Lhuillier-Akakpo, M; Tanty, V; Blugeon, C; Alberti, A; Labadie, K; Aury, JM; Sperling, L; Duharcourt, S; Meyer, E",447.0,"[Singh, Deepankar Pratap; Saudemont, Baptiste; Guglielmi, Gerard; Bhullar, Simran; Bouhouche, Khaled; Tanty, Veronique; Blugeon, Corinne; Meyer, Eric] Ecole Normale Super, Inst Biol, F-75005 Paris, France; [Singh, Deepankar Pratap; Saudemont, Baptiste; Guglielmi, Gerard; Bhullar, Simran; Bouhouche, Khaled; Tanty, Veronique; Blugeon, Corinne; Meyer, Eric] INSERM, U1024, F-75005 Paris, France; [Singh, Deepankar Pratap; Saudemont, Baptiste; Guglielmi, Gerard; Bhullar, Simran; Bouhouche, Khaled; Tanty, Veronique; Blugeon, Corinne; Meyer, Eric] CNRS, UMR 8197, F-75005 Paris, France; [Singh, Deepankar Pratap; Saudemont, Baptiste; Lhuillier-Akakpo, Maoussi] UPMC Univ, Univ Paris 04, IFD, F-75252 Paris 05, France; [Arnaiz, Olivier; Aubusson-Fleury, Anne; Sperling, Linda] CNRS, Ctr Genet Mol, UPR3404, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Arnaiz, Olivier; Aubusson-Fleury, Anne; Sperling, Linda] Univ Paris 11, Dept Biol, F-91405 Orsay, France; [Gout, Jean-Francois] Univ Lyon, UMR5558, CNRS, Lab Biometrie & Biol Evolut, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France; [Prajer, Malgorzata; Przybos, Ewa] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Systemat & Evolut Anim, PL-31016 Krakow, Poland; [Potekhin, Alexey] St Petersburg State Univ, Dept Microbiol, Fac Biol, St Petersburg 199034, Russia; [Lhuillier-Akakpo, Maoussi; Duharcourt, Sandra] Univ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, CNRS, Inst Jacques Monod,UMR 7592, F-75205 Paris, France; [Alberti, Adriana; Labadie, Karine; Aury, Jean-Marc] CEA, IG, Genoscope, F-91057 Evry, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13318,Article,1476-4687,emeyer@biologie.ens.fr,+,"'Investissements d'Avenir' program, Paris Sciences et Lettres* Research University [ANR-10-LABX-54 MEMO LIFE/ANR-11-IDEX-0001-02]; 'Equipe FRM' grant; CNRS ATIP-Avenir; National Science Foundation [MCB-1050161]; Erasmus Mundus program; Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer; Ministere de l'Enseignement Superieur et de la Recherche; Fondation de la Recherche Medicale; CNRS;  [ANR-08-BLAN-0233];  [ANR-12-BSV6-0017];  [ANR-2010-BLAN-1603];  [RFBR 13-04-01683a]","We thank S.

57,78,431.0,"The tumour microenvironment may contribute to tumorigenesis owing to mechanical forces such as fibrotic stiffness or mechanical pressure caused by the expansion of hyper-proliferative cells(1,2). Here we explore the contribution of the mechanical pressure exerted by tumour growth onto non-tumorous adjacent epithelium. In the early stage of mouse colon tumour development in the Notch(+)Apc(+/1638N) mouse model, we observed mechanistic pressure stress in the non-tumorous epithelial cells caused by hyper-proliferative adjacent crypts overexpressing active Notch, which is associated with increased Ret and beta-catenin signalling. We thus developed a method that allows the delivery of a defined mechanical pressure in vivo, by subcutaneously inserting a magnet close to the mouse colon. The implanted magnet generated a magnetic force on ultra-magnetic liposomes, stabilized in the mesenchymal cells of the connective tissue surrounding colonic crypts after intravenous injection. The magnetically induced pressure quantitatively mimicked the endogenous early tumour growth stress in the order of 1,200 Pa, without affecting tissue stiffness, as monitored by ultrasound strain imaging and shear wave elastography. The exertion of pressure mimicking that of tumour growth led to rapid Ret activation and downstream phosphorylation of beta-catenin on Tyr654, imparing its interaction with the E-cadherin in adherens junctions, and which was followed by beta-catenin nuclear translocation after 15 days. As a consequence, increased expression of beta-catenin-target genes was observed at 1 month, together with crypt enlargement accompanying the formation of early tumorous aberrant crypt foci. Mechanical activation of the tumorigenic beta-catenin pathway suggests unexplored modes of tumour propagation based on mechanical signalling pathways in healthy epithelial cells surrounding the tumour, which may contribute to tumour heterogeneity.","Fernandez-Sanchez, Maria Elena; Barbier, Sandrine; Whitehead, Joanne; Bealle, Gaelle; Michel, Aude; Latorre-Ossa, Heldmuth; Rey, Colette; Fouassier, Laura; Claperon, Audrey; Brulle, Laura; Girard, Elodie; Servant, Nicolas; Rio-Frio, Thomas; Marie, Helene; Lesieur, Sylviane; Housset, Chantal; Gennisson, Jean-Luc; Tanter, Mickael; Menager, Christine; Fre, Silvia; Robine, Sylvie; Farge, Emmanuel","Fernandez-Sanchez, ME; Barbier, S; Whitehead, J; Bealle, G; Michel, A; Latorre-Ossa, H; Rey, C; Fouassier, L; Claperon, A; Brulle, L; Girard, E; Servant, N; Rio-Frio, T; Marie, H; Lesieur, S; Housset, C; Gennisson, JL; Tanter, M; Menager, C; Fre, S; Robine, S; Farge, E",92.0,"[Fernandez-Sanchez, Maria Elena; Barbier, Sandrine; Whitehead, Joanne; Farge, Emmanuel] PSL Res Univ, Fdn Pierre Gilles Gennes, CNRS UMR Physicochim Curie Mech & Genet Embryon &, Inst Curie,Ctr Rech,INSERM, F-75005 Paris, France; [Bealle, Gaelle; Michel, Aude; Menager, Christine] Univ Paris 04, UPMC, Lab PHENIX Physicochim Electrolytes & Nanosyst In, CNRS UMR 8234, F-75005 Paris, France; [Latorre-Ossa, Heldmuth; Gennisson, Jean-Luc; Tanter, Mickael] PSL Res Univ, Waves & Images ESPCI ParisTech, Langevin Inst, CNRS UMR7587,Inserm U979, F-75005 Paris, France; [Rey, Colette; Fouassier, Laura; Claperon, Audrey; Housset, Chantal] Univ Paris 04, UPMC, F-75012 Paris, France; [Rey, Colette; Fouassier, Laura; Claperon, Audrey; Housset, Chantal] INSERM, UMR S 938, CDR St Antoine, F-75012 Paris, France; [Brulle, Laura] Inst Curie, Ctr Rech, CNRS UMR3666, INSERM Endocyt Trafficking & Therapeut Delivery U, F-75005 Paris, France; [Girard, Elodie; Servant, Nicolas] Inst Curie, MINES ParisTech, Bioinformat Platform, U900, F-75005 Paris, France; [Rio-Frio, Thomas] Inst Curie, Next Generat Sequencing Platform, F-75005 Paris, France; [Marie, Helene; Lesieur, Sylviane] Univ Paris 11, Lab Physicochim Syst Polyphases, Fac Pharm, CNRS UMR 8612,Inst Galien Paris Sud,LabEx LERMIT, F-92296 Chatenay Malabry, France; [Fre, Silvia] Inst Curie, Unite Genet & Biol Dev, Notch Signaling Stem Cells & Tumors, CNRS UMR 3215,INSERM U934,Ctr Rech, F-75005 Paris, France; [Robine, Sylvie] Inst Curie, Ctr Rech, CNRS Compartimentat & Dynam Cellulaires Morphogen, F-75005 Paris, France",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14329,Article,1476-4687,efarge@curie.fr,+,"CNRS; INSERM; ARC [5030, 29324]; ANR [09PIRI0013-01, 11 BSV5014-01]; Labex CelTisPhyBio [11-LBX-0038]; Fonds CSP; Fondation Pierre-Gille de Gennes; Fondation de France; Inca [PLBIO13-172]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (investissements d'avenir) [ANR-10-EQPX-03, ANR10-INBS-09-08]; Canceropole Ile-de-France","This research was funded by the CNRS, INSERM, ARC (grant no.s 5030 and 29324), ANR (grant no.s 09PIRI0013-01 and 11 BSV5014-01), the Labex CelTisPhyBio (grant no. 11-LBX-0038), Fonds CSP, Fondation Pierre-Gille de Gennes, Fondation de France and the Inca (grant no.

58,111,355.0,"The discovery of quasicrystals(1)-crystalline structures that show order while lacking periodicity-forced a paradigm shift in crystallography. Initially limited to intermetallic systems(1-4), the observation of quasicrystalline structures has recently expanded to include 'soft' quasicrystals in the fields of colloidal and supermolecular chemistry(5-9). Here we report an aperiodic oxide that grows as a two-dimensional quasicrystal on a periodic single-element substrate. On a Pt(111) substrate with 3-fold symmetry, the perovskite barium titanate BaTiO3 forms a high-temperature interface-driven structure with 12-fold symmetry. The building blocks of this dodecagonal structure assemble with the theoretically predicted Stampfli-Gahler tiling(10,11) having a fundamental length-scale of 0.69 nm. This example of interface-driven formation of ultrathin quasicrystals from a typical periodic perovskite oxide potentially extends the quasicrystal concept to a broader range of materials. In addition, it demonstrates that frustration at the interface between two periodic materials can drive a thin film into an aperiodic quasicrystalline phase, as proposed previously(12). Such structures might also find use as ultrathin buffer layers for the accommodation of large lattice mismatches in conventional epitaxy(13).","Foerster, Stefan; Meinel, Klaus; Hammer, Rene; Trautmann, Martin; Widdra, Wolf","Forster, S; Meinel, K; Hammer, R; Trautmann, M; Widdra, W",215.0,"[Foerster, Stefan; Meinel, Klaus; Hammer, Rene; Trautmann, Martin; Widdra, Wolf] Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Phys, D-06120 Halle, Germany; [Widdra, Wolf] Max Planck Inst Mikrostrukturphys, D-06120 Halle, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12514,Article,1476-4687,wolf.widdra@physik.uni-halle.de,+,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [Sonderforschungsbereich 762],"We thank P.

Here we use two-photon calcium imaging to record the activity of large populations of neurons at the cellular level, throughout the brain of larval zebrafish expressing a genetically encoded calcium sensor, while the paralysed animals interact fictively with a virtual environment and rapidly adapt their motor output to changes in visual feedback. We decompose the network dynamics involved in adaptive locomotion into four types of neuronal response properties, and provide anatomical maps of the corresponding sites. A subset of these signals occurred during behavioural adjustments and are candidates for the functional elements that drive motor learning.

60,89,224.0,"During development, thalamocortical (TC) input has a critical role in the spatial delineation and patterning of cortical areas(1-6), yet the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive cortical neuron differentiation are poorly understood. In the primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory cortex, layer 4 (L4) neurons receive mutually exclusive input originating from two thalamic nuclei(7,8): the ventrobasalis (VB), which conveys tactile input(9,10), and the posterior nucleus (Po), which conveys modulatory and nociceptive input(11-14). Recently, we have shown that L4 neuron identity is not fully committed postnatally(15), implying a capacity for TC input to influence differentiation during cortical circuit assembly. Here we investigate whether the cell-type-specific molecular and functional identity of L4 neurons is instructed by the origin of their TC input. Genetic ablation of the VB at birth resulted in an anatomical and functional rewiring of Po projections onto L4 neurons in S1. This induced acquisition of Po input led to a respecification of postsynaptic L4 neurons, which developed functional molecular features of Po-target neurons while repressing VB-target traits. Respecified L4 neurons were able to respond both to touch and to noxious stimuli, in sharp contrast to the normal segregation of these sensory modalities in distinct cortical circuits. These findings reveal a behaviourally relevant TC-input-type-specific control over the molecular and functional differentiation of postsynaptic L4 neurons and cognate intracortical circuits, which instructs the development of modality-specific neuronal and circuit properties during corticogenesis.","Pouchelon, Gabrielle; Gambino, Frederic; Bellone, Camilla; Telley, Ludovic; Vitali, Ilaria; Luescher, Christian; Holtmaat, Anthony; Jabaudon, Denis","Pouchelon, G; Gambino, F; Bellone, C; Telley, L; Vitali, I; Luscher, C; Holtmaat, A; Jabaudon, D",471.0,"[Pouchelon, Gabrielle; Gambino, Frederic; Bellone, Camilla; Telley, Ludovic; Vitali, Ilaria; Luescher, Christian; Holtmaat, Anthony; Jabaudon, Denis] Univ Geneva, Fac Med, Dept Basic Neurosci, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Luescher, Christian; Jabaudon, Denis] Univ Hosp Geneva, Clin Neurol, Dept Clin Neurosci, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Luescher, Christian; Jabaudon, Denis] Univ Geneva, Inst Genet & Genom Geneva IGE3, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13390,Article,1476-4687,denis.jabaudon@unige.ch,+,Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [PP00P3_123447]; Leenaards Foundation; Synapsis Foundation; NARSAD Foundation; Ambizione grant from the SNF; Gertrude von Meissner Foundation; SNF; Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI); SNF [31003A-135631]; EMBO; International Foundation for Research in Paraplegia; Hans Wilsdorf Foundation,"We thank S.

61,230,238.0,"Attosecond science is based on steering electrons with the electric field of well controlled femtosecond laser pulses(1). It has led to the generation of extreme-ultraviolet pulses(2) with a duration of less than 100 attoseconds (ref. 3; 1 as = 10(-18) s), to the measurement of intramolecular dynamics (by diffraction of an electron taken from the molecule under scrutiny(4,5)) and to ultrafast electron holography(6). All these effects have been observed with atoms or molecules in the gas phase. Electrons liberated from solids by few-cycle laser pulses are also predicted(7,8) to show a strong light-phase sensitivity, but only very small effects have been observed(14). Here we report that the spectra of electrons undergoing photoemission from a nanometre-scale tungsten tip show a dependence on the carrier-envelope phase of the laser, with a current modulation of up to 100 per cent. Depending on the carrier-envelope phase, electrons are emitted either from a single sub-500-attosecond interval of the 6-femtosecond laser pulse, or from two such intervals; the latter case leads to spectral interference. We also show that coherent elastic re-scattering of liberated electrons takes place at the metal surface. Owing to field enhancement at the tip, a simple laser oscillator reaches the peak electric field strengths required for attosecond experiments at 100-megahertz repetition rates, rendering complex amplified laser systems dispensable. Practically, this work represents a simple, extremely sensitive carrier-envelope phase sensor, which could be shrunk in volume to about one cubic centimetre. Our results indicate that the attosecond techniques developed with (and for) atoms and molecules can also be used with solids. In particular, we foresee subfemtosecond, subnanometre probing of collective electron dynamics (such as plasmon polaritons(9)) in solid-state systems ranging in scale from mesoscopic solids to clusters and to single protruding atoms.","Krueger, Michael; Schenk, Markus; Hommelhoff, Peter","Kruger, M; Schenk, M; Hommelhoff, P",78.0,"[Krueger, Michael; Schenk, Markus; Hommelhoff, Peter] Max Planck Inst Quantum Opt, Ultrafast Quantum Opt Grp, D-85748 Garching, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10196,Article,1476-4687,peter.hommelhoff@mpq.mpg.de,81,European Union,"We thank M.

63,101,239.0,"Following the discovery of BRD4 as a non-oncogene addiction target in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)(1,2), bromodomain and extra terminal protein (BET) inhibitors are being explored as a promising therapeutic avenue in numerous cancers(3-5). While clinical trials have reported single-agent activity in advanced haematological malignancies(6), mechanisms determining the response to BET inhibition remain poorly understood. To identify factors involved in primary and acquired BET resistance in leukaemia, here we perform a chromatin-focused RNAi screen in a sensitive MLL-AF9; Nras(G12D)-driven AML mouse model, and investigate dynamic transcriptional profiles in sensitive and resistantmouse and human leukaemias. Our screen shows that suppression of the PRC2 complex, contrary to effects in other contexts, promotes BET inhibitor resistance in AML. PRC2 suppression does not directly affect the regulation of Brd4-dependent transcripts, but facilitates the remodelling of regulatory pathways that restore the transcription of key targets such as Myc. Similarly, while BET inhibition triggers acute MYC repression in human leukaemias regardless of their sensitivity, resistant leukaemias are uniformly characterized by their ability to rapidly restore MYC transcription. This process involves the activation and recruitment of WNT signalling components, which compensate for the loss of BRD4 and drive resistance in various cancer models. Dynamic chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing of enhancer profiles reveal that BET-resistant states are characterized by remodelled regulatory landscapes, involving the activation of a focal MYC enhancer that recruits WNT machinery in response to BET inhibition. Together, our results identify and validate WNT signalling as a driver and candidate biomarker of primary and acquired BET resistance in leukaemia, and implicate the rewiring of transcriptional programs as an important mechanism promoting resistance to BET inhibitors and, potentially, other chromatin-targeted therapies.","Rathert, Philipp; Roth, Mareike; Neumann, Tobias; Muerdter, Felix; Roe, Jae-Seok; Muhar, Matthias; Deswal, Sumit; Cerny-Reiterer, Sabine; Peter, Barbara; Jude, Julian; Hoffmann, Thomas; Boryn, Lukasz M.; Axelsson, Elin; Schweifer, Norbert; Tontsch-Grunt, Ulrike; Dow, Lukas E.; Gianni, Davide; Pearson, Mark; Valent, Peter; Stark, Alexander; Kraut, Norbert; Vakoc, Christopher R.; Zuber, Johannes","Rathert, P; Roth, M; Neumann, T; Muerdter, F; Roe, JS; Muhar, M; Deswal, S; Cerny-Reiterer, S; Peter, B; Jude, J; Hoffmann, T; Boryn, LM; Axelsson, E; Schweifer, N; Tontsch-Grunt, U; Dow, LE; Gianni, D; Pearson, M; Valent, P; Stark, A; Kraut, N; Vakoc, CR; Zuber, J",543.0,"[Rathert, Philipp; Roth, Mareike; Neumann, Tobias; Muerdter, Felix; Muhar, Matthias; Deswal, Sumit; Jude, Julian; Hoffmann, Thomas; Boryn, Lukasz M.; Axelsson, Elin; Stark, Alexander; Zuber, Johannes] Vienna Bioctr VBC, Res Inst Mol Pathol IMP, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Roe, Jae-Seok; Vakoc, Christopher R.] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; [Cerny-Reiterer, Sabine; Peter, Barbara; Valent, Peter] Med Univ Vienna, Div Hematol & Hemostaseol, Dept Internal Med 1, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Cerny-Reiterer, Sabine; Peter, Barbara; Valent, Peter] Med Univ Vienna, Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncol, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Schweifer, Norbert; Tontsch-Grunt, Ulrike; Gianni, Davide; Pearson, Mark; Kraut, Norbert] Boehringer Ingelheim Reg Ctr Vienna GmbH, A-1121 Vienna, Austria; [Dow, Lukas E.] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Med Hematol & Med Oncol, New York, NY 10065 USA",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14898,Article,1476-4687,zuber@imp.ac.at,+,"European Research Council (ERC) [336860]; SFB of the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [F4704, F4710]; European Union; ERC [242922]; Boehringer Ingelheim","We thank M.

64,125,192.0,"Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are diseases caused by mutations in the haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) compartment. Most MPN patients have a common acquired mutation of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gene in HSCs1-4 that renders this kinase constitutively active, leading to uncontrolled cell expansion. The bone marrow microenvironment might contribute to the clinical outcomes of this common event. We previously showed that bone marrow nestin(+) mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) innervated by sympathetic nerve fibres regulate normal HSCs5,6. Here we demonstrate that abrogation of this regulatory circuit is essential for MPN pathogenesis. Sympathetic nerve fibres, supporting Schwann cells and nestin(+) MSCs are consistently reduced in the bone marrow of MPN patients and mice expressing the human JAK2(V617F) mutation in HSCs. Unexpectedly, MSC reduction is not due to differentiation but is caused by bone marrow neural damage and Schwann cell death triggered by interleukin-1 beta produced by mutant HSCs. In turn, in vivo depletion of nestin(+) cells or their production of CXCL12 expanded mutant HSC number and accelerated MPN progression. In contrast, administration of neuroprotective or sympathomimetic drugs prevented mutant HSC expansion. Treatment with beta(3)-adrenergic agonists that restored the sympathetic regulation of nestin(+) MSCs5,6 prevented the loss of these cells and blocked MPN progression by indirectly reducing the number of leukaemic stem cells. Our results demonstrate that mutant-HSC-driven niche damage critically contributes to disease manifestation in MPN and identify niche-forming MSCs and their neural regulation as promising therapeutic targets.","Arranz, Lorena; Sanchez-Aguilera, Abel; Martin-Perez, Daniel; Isern, Joan; Langa, Xavier; Tzankov, Alexandar; Lundberg, Pontus; Muntion, Sandra; Tzeng, Yi-Shiuan; Lai, Dar-Ming; Schwaller, Juerg; Skoda, Radek C.; Mendez-Ferrer, Simon","Arranz, L; Sanchez-Aguilera, A; Martin-Perez, D; Isern, J; Langa, X; Tzankov, A; Lundberg, P; Muntion, S; Tzeng, YS; Lai, DM; Schwaller, J; Skoda, RC; Mendez-Ferrer, S",78.0,"[Arranz, Lorena; Sanchez-Aguilera, Abel; Martin-Perez, Daniel; Isern, Joan; Langa, Xavier; Mendez-Ferrer, Simon] CNIC, Stem Cell Niche Pathophysiol Grp, Madrid 28029, Spain; [Tzankov, Alexandar; Lundberg, Pontus; Schwaller, Juerg; Skoda, Radek C.] Univ Basel Hosp, CH-4031 Basel, Switzerland; [Muntion, Sandra] IBSAL Hosp Univ Salamanca, Dept Haematol, Salamanca 37007, Spain; [Tzeng, Yi-Shiuan; Lai, Dar-Ming] Natl Taiwan Univ, Taipei 10002, Taiwan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13383,Article,1476-4687,smendez@cnic.es,+,"Fundacion CNIC; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (TerCel, Spanish Cell Therapy Network) [SAF-2011-30308]; ConSEPOC-Comunidad de Madrid [S2010/BMD-2542]; Ramon y Cajal Program [RYC-2009-04703/2011-09726]; Marie Curie grants [FP7-PEOPLE-2011-RG-294262/294096]; Swiss National Science Foundation [310000-120724/1, 32003BB_135712/1]; Swiss Cancer League [KLS-02398-02-2009]; European Hematology Association; Howard Hughes Medical Institute","We thank S.

65,215,310.0,"From determining the optical properties of simple molecular crystals to establishing the preferred handedness in highly complex vertebrates, molecular chirality profoundly influences the structural, mechanical and optical properties of both synthetic and biological matter on macroscopic length scales(1,2). In soft materials such as amphiphilic lipids and liquid crystals, the competition between local chiral interactions and global constraints imposed by the geometry of the self-assembled structures leads to frustration and the assembly of unique materials(3-6). An example of particular interest is smectic liquid crystals, where the two-dimensional layered geometry cannot support twist and chirality is consequently expelled to the edges in a manner analogous to the expulsion of a magnetic field from superconductors(7-10). Here we demonstrate a consequence of this geometric frustration that leads to a new design principle for the assembly of chiral molecules. Using a model system of colloidal membranes(11), we show that molecular chirality can control the interfacial tension, an important property of multi-component mixtures. This suggests an analogy between chiral twist, which is expelled to the edges of two-dimensional membranes, and amphiphilic surfactants, which are expelled to oil-water interfaces(12). As with surfactants, chiral control of interfacial tension drives the formation of many polymorphic assemblages such as twisted ribbons with linear and circular topologies, starfish membranes, and double and triple helices. Tuning molecular chirality in situ allows dynamical control of line tension, which powers polymorphic transitions between various chiral structures. These findings outline a general strategy for the assembly of reconfigurable chiral materials that can easily be moved, stretched, attached to one another and transformed between multiple conformational states, thus allowing precise assembly and nanosculpting of highly dynamical and designable materials with complex topologies.","Gibaud, Thomas; Barry, Edward; Zakhary, Mark J.; Henglin, Mir; Ward, Andrew; Yang, Yasheng; Berciu, Cristina; Oldenbourg, Rudolf; Hagan, Michael F.; Nicastro, Daniela; Meyer, Robert B.; Dogic, Zvonimir","Gibaud, T; Barry, E; Zakhary, MJ; Henglin, M; Ward, A; Yang, YS; Berciu, C; Oldenbourg, R; Hagan, MF; Nicastro, D; Meyer, RB; Dogic, Z",348.0,"[Gibaud, Thomas; Barry, Edward; Zakhary, Mark J.; Henglin, Mir; Ward, Andrew; Yang, Yasheng; Hagan, Michael F.; Meyer, Robert B.; Dogic, Zvonimir] Brandeis Univ, Martin Fisher Sch Phys, Waltham, MA 02454 USA; [Berciu, Cristina; Nicastro, Daniela] Brandeis Univ, Dept Biol, Waltham, MA 02454 USA; [Oldenbourg, Rudolf] Marine Biol Lab, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10769,Article,,zdogic@brandeis.edu,U127,"US National Science Foundation [NSF-MRSEC-0820492, NSF-DMR-0955776, NSF-MRI-0923057, NSF-CMMI-1068566]; Petroleum Research Fund [ACS-PRF 50558-DNI7]","This work was supported by the US National Science Foundation (NSF-MRSEC-0820492, NSF-DMR-0955776, NSF-MRI-0923057, NSF-CMMI-1068566) and the Petroleum Research Fund (ACS-PRF 50558-DNI7).

66,96,156.0,"Neuroblastoma is a malignant paediatric tumour of the sympathetic nervous system(1). Roughly half of these tumours regress spontaneously or are cured by limited therapy. By contrast, high-risk neuroblastomas have an unfavourable clinical course despite intensive multimodal treatment, and their molecular basis has remained largely elusive(2-4). Here we have performed whole-genome sequencing of 56 neuroblastomas (high-risk, n = 39; low-risk, n = 17) and discovered recurrent genomic rearrangements affecting a chromosomal region at 5p15.33 proximal of the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (TERT). These rearrangements occurred only in high-risk neuroblastomas (12/39, 31%) in a mutually exclusive fashion with MYCN amplifications and ATRX mutations, which are known genetic events in this tumour type(1,2,5). In an extended case series (n = 217), TERT rearrangements defined a subgroup of high-risk tumours with particularly poor outcome. Despite a large structural diversity of these rearrangements, they all induced massive transcriptional upregulation of TERT. In the remaining high-risk tumours, TERT expression was also elevated in MYCN-amplified tumours, whereas alternative lengthening of telomeres was present in neuroblastomas without TERT or MYCN alterations, suggesting that telomere lengthening represents a central mechanism defining this subtype. The 5p15.33 rearrangements juxtapose the TERT coding sequence to strong enhancer elements, resulting in massive chromatin remodelling and DNA methylation of the affected region. Supporting a functional role of TERT, neuroblastoma cell lines bearing rearrangements or amplified MYCN exhibited both upregulated TERT expression and enzymatic telomerase activity. In summary, our findings show that remodelling of the genomic context abrogates transcriptional silencing of TERT in high-risk neuroblastoma and places telomerase activation in the centre of transformation in a large fraction of these tumours.","Peifer, Martin;

67,109,388.0,"Recent studies into the global causes of severe diarrhoea in young children have identified the protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium as the second most important diarrhoeal pathogen after rotavirus(1-3). Diarrhoeal disease is estimated to be responsible for 10.5% of overall child mortality(4). Cryptosporidium is also an opportunistic pathogen in the contexts of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-caused AIDS and organ transplantation(5,6). There is no vaccine and only a single approved drug that provides no benefit for those in gravest danger: malnourished children and immunocompromised patients(7,8). Cryptosporidiosisdrug and vaccine development is limited by the poor tractability of the parasite, which includes a lack of systems for continuous culture, facile animal models, and molecular genetic tools(3,9). Here we describe an experimental framework to genetically modify this important human pathogen. We established and optimized transfection of C. parvum sporozoites in tissue culture. To isolate stable transgenics we developed a mouse model that delivers sporozoites directly into the intestine, aCryptosporidium clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 system, and in vivo selection for aminoglycoside resistance. We derived reporter parasites suitable for in vitro and in vivo drug screening, and we evaluated the basis of drug susceptibility by gene knockout. We anticipate that the ability to genetically engineer this parasite will be transformative for Cryptosporidium research. Genetic reporters will provide quantitative correlates for disease, cure and protection, and the role of parasite genes in these processes is now open to rigorous investigation.","Vinayak, Sumiti; Pawlowic, Mattie C.; Sateriale, Adam; Brooks, Carrie F.; Studstill, Caleb J.; Bar-Peled, Yael; Cipriano, Michael J.; Striepen, Boris","Vinayak, S; Pawlowic, MC; Sateriale, A; Brooks, CF; Studstill, CJ; Bar-Peled, Y; Cipriano, MJ; Striepen, B",477.0,"[Vinayak, Sumiti; Pawlowic, Mattie C.; Sateriale, Adam; Brooks, Carrie F.; Studstill, Caleb J.; Bar-Peled, Yael; Cipriano, Michael J.; Striepen, Boris] Univ Georgia, Ctr Trop & Emerging Global Dis, Paul D Coverdell Ctr, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Striepen, Boris] Univ Georgia, Dept Cellular Biol, Paul D Coverdell Ctr, Athens, GA 30602 USA",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14651,Article,1476-4687,striepen@uga.edu,U232,National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R01AI112427]; Centers for Disease Control; University of Georgia Research Foundation;  [NIH T32AI060546],"We thank L.

68,110,398.0,"Gram-negative bacteria inhabit a broad range of ecological niches. For Escherichia coli, this includes river water as well as humans and animals, where it can be both a commensal and a pathogen(1-3). Intricate regulatory mechanisms ensure that bacteria have the right complement of beta-barrel outer membrane proteins (OMPs) to enable adaptation to a particular habitat(4,5). Yet no mechanism is known for replacing OMPs in the outer membrane, an issue that is further confounded by the lack of an energy source and the high stability(6) and abundance of OMPs(5). Here we uncover the process underpinning OMP turnover in Escherichia coli and show it to be passive and binary in nature, in which old OMPs are displaced to the poles of growing cells as new OMPs take their place. Using fluorescent colicins as OMP-specific probes, in combination with ensemble and single-molecule fluorescence microscopy in vivo and in vitro, as well as molecular dynamics simulations, we established the mechanism for binary OMP partitioning. OMPs clustered to form 0.5-mu m diameter islands, where their diffusion is restricted by promiscuous interactions with other OMPs. OMP islands were distributed throughout the cell and contained the Bam complex, which catalyses the insertion of OMPs in the outer membrane(7,8). However, OMP biogenesis occurred as a gradient that was highest at mid-cell but largely absent at cell poles. The cumulative effect is to push old OMP islands towards the poles of growing cells, leading to a binary distribution when cells divide. Hence, the outer membrane of a Gram-negative bacterium is a spatially and temporally organized structure, and this organization lies at the heart of how OMPs are turned over in the membrane.","Rassam, Patrice; Copeland, Nikki A.; Birkholz, Oliver; Toth, Csaba; Chavent, Matthieu; Duncan, Anna L.; Cross, Stephen J.; Housden, Nicholas G.; Kaminska, Renata; Seger, Urban; Quinn, Diana M.; Garrod, Tamsin J.; Sansom, Mark S.

69,40,115.0,"Membrane proteins that transport hydrophobic compounds have important roles in multi-drug resistance(1-3) and can cause a number of diseases(4,5), underscoring the importance of protein-mediated transport of hydrophobic compounds. Hydrophobic compounds readily partition into regular membrane lipid bilayers(6), and their transport through an aqueous protein channel is energetically unfavourable(3). Alternative transport models involving acquisition from the lipid bilayer by lateral diffusion have been proposed for hydrophobic substrates(3,4,7-12). So far, all transport proteins for which a lateral diffusion mechanism has been proposed function as efflux pumps. Here we present the first example of a lateral diffusion mechanism for the uptake of hydrophobic substrates by the Escherichia coli outer membrane long-chain fatty acid transporter FadL. A FadL mutant in which a lateral opening in the barrel wall is constricted, but which is otherwise structurally identical to wild-type FadL, does not transport substrates. A crystal structure of FadL from Pseudomonas aeruginosa shows that the opening in the wall of the beta-barrel is conserved and delineates a long, hydrophobic tunnel that could mediate substrate passage from the extracellular environment, through the polar lipopolysaccharide layer and, by means of the lateral opening in the barrel wall, into the lipid bilayer from where the substrate can diffuse into the periplasm. Because FadL homologues are found in pathogenic and biodegrading bacteria, our results have implications for combating bacterial infections and bioremediating xenobiotics in the environment.","Hearn, Elizabeth M.; Patel, Dimki R.; Lepore, Bryan W.; Indic, Mridhu; van den Berg, Bert","Hearn, EM; Patel, DR; Lepore, BW; Indic, M; van den Berg, B",367.0,"[Hearn, Elizabeth M.; Patel, Dimki R.; Lepore, Bryan W.; Indic, Mridhu; van den Berg, Bert] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Program Mol Med, Worcester, MA 01605 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07678,Article,,bert.vandenberg@umassmed.edu,U134,National Insitutes of Health; NIH [1R01GM074824],We thank the personnel of the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) beamlines X6A and X29 for beam time and beamline support.

70,181,150.0,"The first indisputable evidence for very early differentiation of the silicate Earth came from the extinct Sm-146-Nd-142 chronometer. Nd-142 excesses measured in 3.7-billion-year (Gyr)-old rocks from Isua(1,2) (southwest Greenland) relative to modern terrestrial samples imply their derivation from a depleted mantle formed in the Hadean eon (about 4,570-4,000 Gyr ago). As dictated by mass balance, the differentiation event responsible for the formation of the Isua early-depleted reservoir must also have formed a complementary enriched component. However, considerable efforts to find early-enriched mantle components in Isua have so far been unsuccessful(3-7). Here we show that the signature of the Hadean enriched reservoir, complementary to the depleted reservoir in Isua, is recorded in 3.4-Gyr-old mafic dykes intruding into the Early Archaean rocks. Five out of seven dykes carry Nd-142 deficits compared to the terrestrial Nd standard, with three samples yielding resolvable deficits down to -10.6 parts per million. The enriched component that we report here could have been a mantle reservoir that differentiated owing to the crystallization of a magma ocean, or could represent a mafic proto-crust that separated from the mantle more than 4.47 Gyr ago. Our results testify to the existence of an enriched component in the Hadean, and may suggest that the southwest Greenland mantle preserved early-formed heterogeneities until at least 3.4 Gyr ago.","Rizo, Hanika; Boyet, Maud; Blichert-Toft, Janne; O'Neil, Jonathan; Rosing, Minik T.; Paquette, Jean-Louis","Rizo, H; Boyet, M; Blichert-Toft, J; O'Neil, J; Rosing, MT; Paquette, JL",96.0,"[Rizo, Hanika; Boyet, Maud; O'Neil, Jonathan; Paquette, Jean-Louis] Univ Clermont Ferrand, Clermont Univ, Lab Magmas & Volcans, CNRS,UMR 6524,IRDR 163, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Blichert-Toft, Janne] Ecole Normale Super Lyon, Lab Geol Lyon, F-69007 Lyon, France; [Blichert-Toft, Janne] Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, UMR 5276, F-69007 Lyon, France; [Rosing, Minik T.] Nat Hist Museum Denmark, DK-1350 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Rosing, Minik T.] Univ Copenhagen, Nord Ctr Earth Evolut, DK-1350 Copenhagen, Denmark",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11565,Article,,h.rizo@opgc.univ-bpclermont.fr,U109,European Research Council under the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme; French Programme National de Planetologie of the Institut National des Sciences de l'Univers and Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales; French Agence Nationale de la Recherche; French embassy in Denmark,"We thank C.

One of the most interesting of these is the ability to achieve superlensing-that is, to focus or image beyond the diffraction limit(7). This originates from the left-handed behaviour-the property of refracting waves negatively-that is typical of negative index metamaterials(8-10). Yet reaching this goal requires the design of 'double negative' metamaterials, which act simultaneously on the permittivity and permeability in electromagnetics(11,12), or on the density and compressibility in acoustics; this generally implies the use of two different kinds of building blocks(13,14) or specific particles presenting multiple overlapping resonances(15-17). Such a requirement limits the applicability of double negative metamaterials, and has, for example, hampered any demonstration of subwavelength focusing using left-handed acoustic metamaterials(18). Here we show that these strict conditions can be largely relaxed by relying on media that consist of only one type of single resonant unit cell. Specifically, we show with a simple yet general semi-analytical model that judiciously breaking the symmetry of a single negative metamaterial is sufficient to turn it into a double negative one. We then demonstrate that this occurs solely because of multiple scattering of waves off the metamaterial resonant elements, a phenomenon often disregarded in these media owing to their subwavelength patterning. We apply our approach to acoustics and verify through numerical simulations that it allows the realization of negative index acoustic metamaterials based on Helmholtz resonators only. Finally, we demonstrate the operation of a negative index acoustic superlens, achieving subwavelength focusing and imaging with spot width and resolution 7 and 3.5 times better than the diffraction limit, respectively. Our findings have profound implications for the physics of metamaterials, highlighting the role of their subwavelength crystalline structure, and hence entering the realm of metamaterial crystals. This widens the scope of possibilities for designing composite media with novel properties in a much simpler way than has been possible so far.","Kaina, Nadege; Lemoult, Fabrice; Fink, Mathias; Lerosey, Geoffroy","Kaina, N; Lemoult, F; Fink, M; Lerosey, G",77.0,"[Kaina, Nadege; Lemoult, Fabrice; Fink, Mathias; Lerosey, Geoffroy] ESPCI ParisTech, Inst Langevin, F-75005 Paris, France; [Kaina, Nadege; Lemoult, Fabrice; Fink, Mathias; Lerosey, Geoffroy] CNRS, UMR 7587, F-75005 Paris, France",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14678,Article,1476-4687,geoffroy.lerosey@espci.fr,+,"LABEX WIFI (Laboratory of Excellence within the French Program ""Investments for the Future"") [ANR-10-LABX-24, ANR-10-IDEX-0001-02 PSL*]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-13-JS09-0001-01]; French ""Direction Generale de l'Armement""","We thank A.

73,77,51.0,"Translation initiation is a major determinant of the overall expression level of a gene(1 - 3). The translation of functionally active protein requires the messenger RNA to be positioned on the ribosome such that the start/ initiation codon will be read first and in the correct frame. Little is known about the molecular basis for the interaction of mRNA with the ribosome at different states of translation. Recent crystal structures of the ribosomal subunits(4 - 8), the empty 70S ribosome(9) and the 70S ribosome containing functional ligands(10 - 13) have provided information about the general organization of the ribosome and its functional centres. Here we compare the X- ray structures of eight ribosome complexes modelling the translation initiation, post- initiation and elongation states. In the initiation and post- initiation complexes, the presence of the Shine - Dalgarno ( SD) duplex causes strong anchoring of the 5' end of mRNA onto the platform of the 30S subunit, with numerous interactions between mRNA and the ribosome. Conversely, the 5' end of the ' elongator' mRNA lacking SD interactions is flexible, suggesting a different exit path for mRNA during elongation. After the initiation of translation, but while an SD interaction is still present, mRNA moves in the 3' -->5' direction with simultaneous clockwise rotation and lengthening of the SD duplex, bringing it into contact with ribosomal protein S2.","Yusupova, Gulnara; Jenner, Lasse; Rees, Bernard; Moras, Dino; Yusupov, Marat","Yusupova, G; Jenner, L; Rees, B; Moras, D; Yusupov, M",391.0,"Inst Genet & Biol Mol & Cellulaire, F-67404 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature05281,Article,,marat@titus.u-strasbg.fr,394,,,105GL,,,ANGSTROM RESOLUTION; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; TRANSLATION INITIATION; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURES; BINDING SITE; SUBUNIT; SEQUENCES; CODON,7117.0,NATURE,Nature,English,25.0,No,"Yusupov, Marat/0000-0001-5544-0597; Jenner, Lasse/0000-0003-3917-8853","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",16-Nov,4.0,LONDON,17051149.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,"Yusupov, Marat/I-6126-2013; Yusupova , Gulnara/E-1877-2014","Yusupov, M (reprint author), Inst Genet & Biol Mol & Cellulaire, F-67404 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,175.0,Structural basis for messenger RNA movement on the ribosome,1.0,19.0,WOS:000242018300054,51.0,444,Multidisciplinary Sciences,181,marat,yusupov,8025.0,11,male,1.0,uGcWXC4AAAAJ,3,"(4126, 9345]",607978,1,2087394,1,List of Tatars,List of Tatars,0,0
74,87,49.0,"Skeletal growth relies on both biosynthetic and catabolic processes(1,2). While the role of the former is clearly established, how the latter contributes to growth-promoting pathways is less understood. Macroautophagy, hereafter referred to as autophagy, is a catabolic process that plays a fundamental part in tissue homeostasis(3). We investigated the role of autophagy during bone growth, which is mediated by chondrocyte rate of proliferation, hypertrophic differentiation and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition in growth plates(4). Here we show that autophagy is induced in growth-plate chondrocytes during post-natal development and regulates the secretion of type II collagen (Col2), the major component of cartilage ECM. Mice lacking the autophagy related gene 7 (Atg7) in chondrocytes experience endoplasmic reticulum storage of type II procollagen (PC2) and defective formation of the Col2 fibrillary network in the ECM. Surprisingly, post-natal induction of chondrocyte autophagy is mediated by the growth factor FGF18 through FGFR4 and JNK-dependent activation of the autophagy initiation complex VPS34-beclin-1. Autophagy is completely suppressed in growth plates from Fgf18(-/-) embryos, while Fgf18(+/-) heterozygous and Fgfr4(-/-) mice fail to induce autophagy during post-natal development and show decreased Col2 levels in the growth plate. Strikingly, the Fgf18(+/-) and Fgfr4(-/-) phenotypes can be rescued in vivo by pharmacological activation of autophagy, pointing to autophagy as a novel effector of FGF signalling in bone. These data demonstrate that autophagy is a developmentally regulated process necessary for bone growth, and identify FGF signalling as a crucial regulator of autophagy in chondrocytes.","Cinque, Laura; Forrester, Alison; Bartolomeo, Rosa; Svelto, Maria; Venditti, Rossella; Montefusco, Sandro; Polishchuk, Elena; Nusco, Edoardo; Rossi, Antonio; Medina, Diego L.; Polishchuk, Roman; De Matteis, Maria Antonietta; Settembre, Carmine","Cinque, L; Forrester, A; Bartolomeo, R; Svelto, M; Venditti, R; Montefusco, S; Polishchuk, E; Nusco, E; Rossi, A; Medina, DL; Polishchuk, R; De Matteis, MA; Settembre, C",272.0,"[Cinque, Laura; Forrester, Alison; Bartolomeo, Rosa; Svelto, Maria; Venditti, Rossella; Montefusco, Sandro; Polishchuk, Elena; Nusco, Edoardo; Medina, Diego L.; Polishchuk, Roman; De Matteis, Maria Antonietta; Settembre, Carmine] Telethon Inst Genet & Med TIGEM, I-80078 Pozzuoli, NA, Italy; [Cinque, Laura; Forrester, Alison; Bartolomeo, Rosa; Svelto, Maria; Settembre, Carmine] Dulbecco Telethon Inst, I-80078 Pozzuoli, NA, Italy; [Forrester, Alison; Svelto, Maria; Settembre, Carmine] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Med & Translat Sci, Med Genet Unit, I-80131 Naples, Italy; [Rossi, Antonio] Univ Pavia, Biochem Unit, Dept Mol Med, I-27100 Pavia, Italy",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature16063,Article,1476-4687,settembre@tigem.it,+,Italian Telethon Foundation [TCP12008]; Marie Curie European Reintegration Grant [PCIG13-GA-2013-618805]; STAR/Banco di Napoli; Italian Ministry of Research [FIRB RBFR13LH4X],"We thank A.

75,150,224.0,"The El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the Earth's most prominent source of interannual climate variability, exerting profound worldwide effects(1-7). Despite decades of research, its behaviour continues to challenge scientists. In the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean, the anomalously cool sea surface temperatures (SSTs) found during La Nina events and the warm waters of modest El Nino events both propagate westwards, as in the seasonal cycle(7). In contrast, SST anomalies propagate eastwards during extreme El Nino events, prominently in the post-1976 period(7-10), spurring unusual weather events worldwide with costly consequences(3-6,11). The cause of this propagation asymmetry is currently unknown(10). Here we trace the cause of the asymmetry to the variations in upper ocean currents in the equatorial Pacific, whereby the westward-flowing currents are enhanced during La Nina events but reversed during extreme El Nino events. Our results highlight that propagation asymmetry is favoured when the westward mean equatorial currents weaken, as is projected to be the case under global warming(12-14). By analysing past and future climate simulations of an ensemble of models with more realistic propagation, we find a doubling in the occurrences of El Nino events that feature prominent eastward propagation characteristics in a warmer world. Our analysis thus suggests that more frequent emergence of propagation asymmetry will be an indication of the Earth's warming climate.","Santoso, Agus; McGregor, Shayne; Jin, Fei-Fei; Cai, Wenju; England, Matthew H.; An, Soon-Il; McPhaden, Michael J.; Guilyardi, Eric","Santoso, A; McGregor, S; Jin, FF; Cai, WJ; England, MH; An, SI; McPhaden, MJ; Guilyardi, E",126.0,"[Santoso, Agus; McGregor, Shayne; England, Matthew H.] Univ New S Wales, Australian Res Council ARC Ctr Excellence Climate, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Santoso, Agus; McGregor, Shayne; England, Matthew H.] Univ New S Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Jin, Fei-Fei] Univ Hawaii Manoa, SOEST, Dept Meteorol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Cai, Wenju] CSIRO, Marine & Atmospher Res, Aspendale, Vic 3195, Australia; [An, Soon-Il] Yonsei Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Seoul 120749, South Korea; [McPhaden, Michael J.] NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Guilyardi, Eric] Univ Paris 06, CNRS, IPSL, Lab Oceanog & Climat Experimentat & Approches Num, F-75252 Paris 05, France; [Guilyardi, Eric] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci NCAS Climate, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12683,Article,1476-4687,a.santoso@unsw.edu.au,+,Australian Research Council; Australian Climate Change Science Programme; National Research Foundation of Korea; Korean government (MEST) [NRF-2009-C1AAA001-2009-0093042]; NOAA,"We acknowledge the World Climate Research Programme's Working Group on Coupled Modelling and all modelling groups for making the CMIP data available.

76,82,299.0,"The rich and immediate perception of a familiar face, including its identity, expression and even intent, is one of the most impressive shared faculties of human and non-human primate brains. Many visually responsive neurons in the inferotemporal cortex of macaque monkeys respond selectively to faces(1-4), sometimes to only one or a few individuals(5-7), while showing little sensitivity to scale and other details of the retinal image(8,9). Here we show that face-responsive neurons in the macaque monkey anterior inferotemporal cortex are tuned to a fundamental dimension of face perception. Using a norm-based caricaturization framework previously developed for human psychophysics(10-12), we varied the identity information present in photo-realistic human faces(13), and found that neurons of the anterior inferotemporal cortex were most often tuned around the average, identity-ambiguous face. These observations are consistent with face-selective responses in this area being shaped by a figural comparison, reflecting structural differences between an incoming face and an internal reference or norm. As such, these findings link the tuning of neurons in the inferotemporal cortex to psychological models of face identity perception.","Leopold, David A.; Bondar, Igor V.; Giese, Martin A.","Leopold, DA; Bondar, IV; Giese, MA",572.0,"Max Planck Inst Biol Cybernet, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; Univ Clin Tubingen, Hertie Inst Clin Brain Res, Dept Cognit Neurol, Lab Act Representat & Learning, D-72072 Tubingen, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature04951,Article,,leopoldd@mail.nih.gov,575,,,069NQ,,,INFERIOR TEMPORAL CORTEX; VISUAL-CORTEX; RECOGNITION; DISTINCTIVENESS; RESPONSES; MACAQUE; IDENTIFICATION; SELECTIVITY; CARICATURES; IDENTITY,7102.0,NATURE,Nature,English,26.0,No,"Leopold, David/0000-0002-1345-6360","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",3-Aug,4.0,LONDON,16862123.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,,"Leopold, DA (reprint author), NIMH, Unit Cognit Neurophysiol & Imaging, Neuropsychol Lab, NIH, 49 Convent Dr,Bldg 49,MSC 4400, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,197.0,Norm-based face encoding by single neurons in the monkey inferotemporal cortex,1.0,16.0,WOS:000239455900045,299.0,442,Multidisciplinary Sciences,197,martin a.,giese,5868.0,1,male,1.0,ebo0Qn4AAAAJ,3,"(4126, 9345]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0

However, it has long been known that the realization of coherent interactions between individual photons, akin to those associated with conventional massive particles, could enable a wide variety of novel scientific and engineering applications(2,3). Here we demonstrate a quantum nonlinear medium inside which individual photons travel as massive particles with strong mutual attraction, such that the propagation of photon pairs is dominated by a two-photon bound state(4-7). We achieve this through dispersive coupling of light to strongly interacting atoms in highly excited Rydberg states. We measure the dynamical evolution of the two-photon wave-function using time-resolved quantum state tomography, and demonstrate a conditional phase shift(8) exceeding one radian, resulting in polarization-entangled photon pairs. Particular applications of this technique include all-optical switching, deterministic photonic quantum logic and the generation of strongly correlated states of light(9).","Firstenberg, Ofer; Peyronel, Thibault; Liang, Qi-Yu; Gorshkov, Alexey V.; Lukin, Mikhail D.; Vuletic, Vladan","Firstenberg, O; Peyronel, T; Liang, QY; Gorshkov, AV; Lukin, MD; Vuletic, V",71.0,"[Firstenberg, Ofer; Lukin, Mikhail D.] Harvard Univ, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Peyronel, Thibault; Liang, Qi-Yu; Vuletic, Vladan] MIT, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Peyronel, Thibault; Liang, Qi-Yu; Vuletic, Vladan] MIT, Elect Res Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Gorshkov, Alexey V.] CALTECH, Inst Quantum Informat & Matter, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12512,Article,,lukin@fas.harvard.edu; vuletic@mit.edu,+,"NSF; CUA; DARPA; AFOSR Quantum Memories MURI Foundation; Packard Foundation; HQOC; Lee A.

However, TDG was also found to interact with transcription factors(2,3), histone acetyltransferases(4) and de novo DNA methyltransferases(5,6), and it has been associated with DNA demethylation in gene promoters following activation of transcription(7-9), altogether implicating an engagement in gene regulation rather than DNA repair. Here we use a mouse genetic approach to determine the biological function of this multifaceted DNA repair enzyme. We find that, unlike other DNA glycosylases, TDG is essential for embryonic development, and that this phenotype is associated with epigenetic aberrations affecting the expression of developmental genes. Fibroblasts derived from Tdg null embryos (mouse embryonic fibroblasts, MEFs) show impaired gene regulation, coincident with imbalanced histone modification and CpG methylation at promoters of affected genes. TDG associates with the promoters of such genes both in fibroblasts and in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), but epigenetic aberrations only appear upon cell lineage commitment. We show that TDG contributes to the maintenance of active and bivalent chromatin throughout cell differentiation, facilitating a proper assembly of chromatin-modifying complexes and initiating base excision repair to counter aberrant de novo methylation. We thus conclude that TDG-dependent DNA repair has evolved to provide epigenetic stability in lineage committed cells.","Cortazar, Daniel; Kunz, Christophe; Selfridge, Jim; Lettieri, Teresa; Saito, Yusuke; MacDougall, Eilidh; Wirz, Annika; Schuermann, David; Jacobs, Angelika L.; Siegrist, Fredy; Steinacher, Roland; Jiricny, Josef; Bird, Adrian; Schaer, Primo","Cortazar, D; Kunz, C; Selfridge, J; Lettieri, T; Saito, Y; MacDougall, E; Wirz, A; Schuermann, D; Jacobs, AL; Siegrist, F; Steinacher, R; Jiricny, J; Bird, A; Schar, P",419.0,"[Cortazar, Daniel; Kunz, Christophe; Saito, Yusuke; Wirz, Annika; Schuermann, David; Jacobs, Angelika L.; Steinacher, Roland; Schaer, Primo] Univ Basel, Inst Biochem & Genet, Dept Biomed, CH-4048 Basel, Switzerland; [Selfridge, Jim; MacDougall, Eilidh; Bird, Adrian] Univ Edinburgh, Wellcome Trust Ctr Cell Biol, Edinburgh EH9 3JR, Midlothian, Scotland; [Lettieri, Teresa; Jiricny, Josef] Univ Zurich, Inst Mol Canc Res, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Siegrist, Fredy] F Hoffmann La Roche Ltd, Global Preclin Safety, Pharmaceut Res, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09672,Article,,primo.schaer@unibas.ch,U210,"Swiss National Science Foundation [3100A0-108436, 3100A0-122574/]; Association For International Cancer Research [01-330]","We thank D.

79,75,469.0,"Dispersal has a significant impact on lifetime reproductive success(1), and is often more prevalent in one sex than the other(2). In group- living mammals, dispersal is normally male- biased and in theory this sexual bias could be a response by males to female mate preferences, competition for access to females or resources, or the result of males avoiding inbreeding(2-7). There is a lack of studies on social mammals that simultaneously assess these factors and measure the fitness consequences of male dispersal decisions. Here we show that male- biased dispersal in the spotted hyaena ( Crocuta crocuta) most probably results from an adaptive response by males to simple female mate- choice rules that have evolved to avoid inbreeding. Microsatellite profiling revealed that females preferred sires that were born into or immigrated into the female's group after the female was born. Furthermore, young females preferred short- tenured sires and older females preferred longer- tenured sires. Males responded to these female mate preferences by initiating their reproductive careers in groups containing the highest number of young females. As a consequence, 11% of males started their reproductive career in their natal group and 89% of males dispersed. Males that started reproduction in groups containing the highest number of young females had a higher long- term reproductive success than males that did not. The female mate- choice rules ensured that females effectively avoided inbreeding without the need to discriminate directly against close kin or males born in their own group, or to favour immigrant males. The extent of male dispersal as a response to such female mate preferences depends on the demographic structure of breeding groups, rather than the genetic relatedness between females and males.","Hoener, O.

80,16,395.0,"The major nutrients nitrate and phosphate have one of the strongest correlations in the sea, with a slope similar to the average nitrogen (N) to phosphorus (P) content of plankton biomass (N/P = 16:1). The processes through which this global relationship emerges despite the wide range of N/P ratios at the organism level are not known. Here we use an ocean circulation model and observed nutrient distributions to show that the N/P ratio of biological nutrient removal varies across latitude in Southern Ocean surface waters, from 12: 1 in the polar ocean to 20: 1 in the sub-Antarctic zone. These variations are governed by regional differences in the species composition of the plankton community. The covariation of dissolved nitrate and phosphate is maintained by ocean circulation, which mixes the shallow subsurface nutrients between distinct biogeographic provinces. Climate-driven shifts in these marine biomes may alter the mean N/P ratio and the associated carbon export by Southern Ocean ecosystems.","Weber, Thomas S.; Deutsch, Curtis","Weber, TS; Deutsch, C",550.0,"[Weber, Thomas S.; Deutsch, Curtis] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09403,Article,,tweber@atmos.ucla.edu,554,National Science Foundation; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation; UCLA,We thank S.

81,17,470.0,"A central hub of carbon metabolism is the tricarboxylic acid cycle 1, which serves to connect the processes of glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, respiration, amino acid synthesis and other biosynthetic pathways. The protozoan intracellular malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.), however, have long been suspected of possessing a significantly streamlined carbon metabolic network in which tricarboxylic acid metabolism plays a minor role(2). Blood-stage Plasmodium parasites rely almost entirely on glucose fermentation for energy and consume minimal amounts of oxygen(3), yet the parasite genome encodes all of the enzymes necessary for a complete tricarboxylic acid cycle(4). Here, by tracing (13)C-labelled compounds using mass spectrometry(5), we show that tricarboxylic acid metabolism in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum is largely disconnected from glycolysis and is organized along a fundamentally different architecture from the canonical textbook pathway. We find that this pathway is not cyclic, but rather is a branched structure in which the major carbon sources are the amino acids glutamate and glutamine. As a consequence of this branched architecture, several reactions must run in the reverse of the standard direction, thereby generating two-carbon units in the form of acetyl-coenzyme A. We further show that glutamine-derived acetyl-coenzyme A is used for histone acetylation, whereas glucose-derived acetyl-coenzyme A is used to acetylate amino sugars. Thus, the parasite has evolved two independent production mechanisms for acetyl-coenzyme A with different biological functions. These results significantly clarify our understanding of the Plasmodium metabolic network and highlight the ability of altered variants of central carbon metabolism to arise in response to unique environments.","Olszewski, Kellen L.; Mather, Michael W.; Morrisey, Joanne M.; Garcia, Benjamin A.; Vaidya, Akhil B.; Rabinowitz, Joshua D.; Llinas, Manuel","Olszewski, KL; Mather, MW; Morrisey, JM; Garcia, BA; Vaidya, AB; Rabinowitz, JD; Llinas, M",774.0,"[Olszewski, Kellen L.; Llinas, Manuel] Princeton Univ, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Olszewski, Kellen L.; Rabinowitz, Joshua D.; Llinas, Manuel] Princeton Univ, Lewis Sigler Inst Integrat Gen, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Mather, Michael W.; Morrisey, Joanne M.; Vaidya, Akhil B.] Drexel Univ, Coll Med, Ctr Mol Parasitol, Philadelphia, PA 19129 USA; [Garcia, Benjamin A.] Princeton Univ, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Rabinowitz, Joshua D.] Princeton Univ, Dept Chem, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09301,Article,,manuel@genomics.princeton.edu,U16,"Burroughs Wellcome Fund; NIH [1DP2OD001315-01, R01 AI078063]; Beckman Young Investigators award; NSF [CBET-0941143]; Center for Quantitative Biology [P50 GM071508]; NIAID, NIH [AI028398]","We thank G.

82,24,167.0,"Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are transcriptional repressors that control processes ranging from the maintenance of cell fate decisions and stem cell pluripotency in animals to the control of flowering time in plants(1-6). In Drosophila, genetic studies identified more than 15 different PcG proteins that are required to repress homeotic (HOX) and other developmental regulator genes in cells where they must stay inactive(1,7,8). Biochemical analyses established that these PcG proteins exist in distinct multiprotein complexes that bind to and modify chromatin of target genes(1-4). Among those, Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) and the related dRing-associated factors (dRAF) complex contain an E3 ligase activity for monoubiquitination of histone H2A (refs 1-4). Here we show that the uncharacterized Drosophila PcG gene calypso encodes the ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase BAP1. Biochemically purified Calypso exists in a complex with the PcG protein ASX, and this complex, named Polycomb repressive deubiquitinase (PR-DUB), is bound at PcG target genes in Drosophila. Reconstituted recombinant Drosophila and human PR-DUB complexes remove monoubiquitin from H2A but not from H2B in nucleosomes. Drosophila mutants lacking PR-DUB show a strong increase in the levels of monoubiquitinated H2A. A mutation that disrupts the catalytic activity of Calypso, or absence of the ASX subunit abolishes H2A deubiquitination in vitro and HOX gene repression in vivo. Polycomb gene silencing may thus entail adynamic balance between H2A ubiquitination by PRC1 and dRAF, and H2A deubiquitination by PR-DUB.","Scheuermann, Johanna C.; Alonso, Andres Gaytan de Ayala; Oktaba, Katarzyna; Ly-Hartig, Nga; McGinty, Robert K.; Fraterman, Sven; Wilm, Matthias; Muir, Tom W.; Mueller, Juerg","Scheuermann, JC; Alonso, AGD; Oktaba, K; Ly-Hartig, N; McGinty, RK; Fraterman, S; Wilm, M; Muir, TW; Muller, J",243.0,"[Scheuermann, Johanna C.; Alonso, Andres Gaytan de Ayala; Oktaba, Katarzyna; Ly-Hartig, Nga; Fraterman, Sven; Wilm, Matthias; Mueller, Juerg] European Mol Biol Lab, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [McGinty, Robert K.; Muir, Tom W.] Rockefeller Univ, New York, NY 10065 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08966,Article,,juerg.mueller@embl.de,U138,NIH [RC2CA148354]; EMBL; DFG,"We thank T.

83,131,350.0,"The silkworm Bombyx mori uses a WZ sex determination system that is analogous to the one found in birds and some reptiles. In this system, males have two Z sex chromosomes, whereas females have Z and W sex chromosomes. The silkworm W chromosome has a dominant role in female determination(1,2), suggesting the existence of a dominant feminizing gene in this chromosome. However, the W chromosomeis almost fully occupied by transposable element sequences(3-5), and no functional protein-coding gene has been identified so far. Female-enriched PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are the only known transcripts that are produced from the sex-determining region of the W chromosome(6), but the function(s) of these piRNAs are unknown. Here we show that a W-chromosome-derived, female-specific piRNA is the feminizing factor of B. mori. This piRNA is produced from a piRNA precursor which we named Fem. Fem sequences were arranged in tandem in the sex-determining region of the W chromosome. Inhibition of Fem-derived piRNA-mediated signalling in female embryos led to the production of the male-specific splice variants of B. mori doublesex (Bmdsx), a gene which acts at the downstream end of the sex differentiation cascade(7,8). A target gene of Fem-derived piRNA was identified on the Z chromosome of B. mori. This gene, which we named Masc, encoded a CCCH-type zinc finger protein. We show that the silencing of Masc messenger RNA by Fem piRNA is required for the production of female-specific isoforms of Bmdsx in female embryos, and that Masc protein controls both dosage compensation and masculinization in male embryos. Our study characterizes a single small RNA that is responsible for primary sex determination in the WZ sex determination system.","Kiuchi, Takashi; Koga, Hikaru; Kawamoto, Munetaka; Shoji, Keisuke; Sakai, Hiroki; Arai, Yuji; Ishihara, Genki; Kawaoka, Shinpei; Sugano, Sumio; Shimada, Toru; Suzuki, Yutaka; Suzuki, Masataka G.; Katsuma, Susumu","Kiuchi, T; Koga, H; Kawamoto, M; Shoji, K; Sakai, H; Arai, Y; Ishihara, G; Kawaoka, S; Sugano, S; Shimada, T; Suzuki, Y; Suzuki, MG; Katsuma, S",633.0,"[Kiuchi, Takashi; Koga, Hikaru; Kawamoto, Munetaka; Shoji, Keisuke; Arai, Yuji; Ishihara, Genki; Kawaoka, Shinpei; Shimada, Toru; Katsuma, Susumu] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Dept Agr & Environm Biol, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138657, Japan; [Sakai, Hiroki; Suzuki, Masataka G.] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Dept Integrated Biosci, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778562, Japan; [Sugano, Sumio; Suzuki, Yutaka] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Dept Med Genome Sci, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088639, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13315,Article,1476-4687,katsuma@ss.ab.a.u-tokyo.ac.jp,+,Program for Promotion of Basic and Applied Researches for Innovations in Bio-oriented Industry;  [22115502];  [22128004],We thank S.

84,57,421.0,"Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death worldwide, with over one million cases annually(1). To identify genetic factors that modify disease risk, we conducted a genome- wide association study by analysing 317,139 single- nucleotide polymorphisms in 1,989 lung cancer cases and 2,625 controls from six central European countries. We identified a locus in chromosome region 15q25 that was strongly associated with lung cancer ( P= 9 x 10(-10)). This locus was replicated in five separate lung cancer studies comprising an additional 2,513 lung cancer cases and 4,752 controls ( P = 5 x 10(-20) overall), and it was found to account for 14%( attributable risk) of lung cancer cases. Statistically similar risks were observed irrespective of smoking status or propensity to smoke tobacco. The association region contains several genes, including three that encode nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits ( CHRNA5, CHRNA3 and CHRNB4). Such subunits are expressed in neurons and other tissues, in particular alveolar epithelial cells, pulmonary neuroendocrine cells and lung cancer cell lines(2,3), and they bind to N'- nitrosonornicotine and potential lung carcinogens(4). A non- synonymous variant of CHRNA5 that induces an amino acid substitution ( D398N) at a highly conserved site in the second intracellular loop of the protein is among the markers with the strongest disease associations. Our results provide compelling evidence of a locus at 15q25 predisposing to lung cancer, and reinforce interest in nicotinic acetylcholine receptors as potential disease candidates and chemopreventative targets(5).","Hung, Rayjean J.; Mckay, James D.; Gaborieau, Valerie; Boffetta, Paolo; Hashibe, Mia; Zaridze, David; Mukeria, Anush; Szeszenia-Dabrowska, Neonilia; Lissowska, Jolanta; Rudnai, Peter; Fabianova, Eleonora; Mates, Dana; Bencko, Vladimir; Foretova, Lenka; Janout, Vladimir; Chen, Chu; Goodman, Gary; Field, John K.; Liloglou, Triantafillos; Xinarianos, George; Cassidy, Adrian; McLaughlin, John; Liu, Geoffrey; Narod, Steven; Krokan, Hans E.; Skorpen, Frank; Elvestad, Maiken Bratt; Hveem, Kristian; Vatten, Lars; Linseisen, Jakob; Clavel-Chapelon, Francoise; Vineis, Paolo; Bueno-de-Mesquita, H.

85,100,226.0,"Nuclear pore complexes are fundamental components of all eukaryotic cells that mediate nucleocytoplasmic exchange. Determining their 110-megadalton structure imposes a formidable challenge and requires in situ structural biology approaches. Of approximately 30 nucleoporins (Nups), 15 are structured and form the Y and innerring complexes. These two major scaffolding modules assemble in multiple copies into an eight-fold rotationally symmetric structure that fuses the inner and outer nuclear membranes to forma central channel of similar to 60 nm in diameter(1). The scaffold is decorated with transport-channel Nups that often contain phenylalanine-repeat sequences and mediate the interaction with cargo complexes. Although the architectural arrangement of parts of the Y complex has been elucidated, it is unclear how exactly it oligomerizes in situ. Here we combine cryo-electron tomography with mass spectrometry, biochemical analysis, perturbation experiments and structural modelling to generate, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive architectural model of the human nuclear pore complex to date. Our data suggest previously unknown protein interfaces across Y complexes and to inner-ring complex members. We show that the transport-channel Nup358 (also known as Ranbp2) has a previously unanticipated role in Y-complex oligomerization. Our findings blur the established boundaries between scaffold and transport-channel Nups. We conclude that, similar to coated vesicles, several copies of the same structural building block-although compositionally identical-engage in different local sets of interactions and conformations.","von Appen, Alexander; Kosinski, Jan; Sparks, Lenore; Ori, Alessandro; DiGuilio, Amanda L.; Vollmer, Benjamin; Mackmull, Marie-Therese; Banterle, Niccolo; Parca, Luca; Kastritis, Panagiotis; Buczak, Katarzyna; Mosalaganti, Shyamal; Hagen, Wim; Andres-Pons, Amparo; Lemke, Edward A.; Bork, Peer; Antonin, Wolfram; Glavy, Joseph S.; Bui, Khanh Huy; Beck, Martin","von Appen, A; Kosinski, J; Sparks, L; Ori, A; DiGuilio, AL; Vollmer, B; Mackmull, MT; Banterle, N; Parca, L; Kastritis, P; Buczak, K; Mosalaganti, S; Hagen, W; Andres-Pons, A; Lemke, EA; Bork, P; Antonin, W; Glavy, JS; Bui, KH; Beck, M",140.0,"[von Appen, Alexander; Kosinski, Jan; Sparks, Lenore; Ori, Alessandro; Mackmull, Marie-Therese; Banterle, Niccolo; Parca, Luca; Kastritis, Panagiotis; Buczak, Katarzyna; Mosalaganti, Shyamal; Hagen, Wim; Andres-Pons, Amparo; Lemke, Edward A.; Bork, Peer; Bui, Khanh Huy; Beck, Martin] European Mol Biol Lab, Struct & Computat Biol Unit, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [DiGuilio, Amanda L.; Glavy, Joseph S.] Stevens Inst Technol, Dept Chem Chem Biol & Biomed Engn, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA; [Vollmer, Benjamin; Antonin, Wolfram] Max Planck Gesell, Friedrich Miescher Lab, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Bui, Khanh Huy] McGill Univ, Dept Anat & Cell Biol, Montreal, PQ H3A 0C7, Canada",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15381,Article,1476-4687,huy.bui@mcgill.ca; martin.beck@embl.de,+,EMBL's mechanical workshop; Electron Microscopy and Proteomics Core Facilities; Centre for Statistical Data Analysis; Swiss National Science Foundation; European Molecular Biology Organization; Marie Curie Actions; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation; Robert Crooks Stanley Fellowship at the Stevens Institute of Technology; National Institute on Aging (NIA) [1R21AG047433-01]; EMBL Interdisciplinary Postdoc Programme under Marie Curie COFUND Actions; Ignition Grant Initiative from Stevens Institute of Technology; NIA [1R21AG047433-01]; EMBL; European Research Council [309271-NPCAtlas],"We are grateful to W.

86,180,114.0,"With remarkable precision and reproducibility, cells orchestrate the cooperative action of thousands of nanometre-sized molecular motors to carry out mechanical tasks at much larger length scales, such as cell motility, division and replication(1). Besides their biological importance, such inherently non-equilibrium processes suggest approaches for developing biomimetic active materials from microscopic components that consume energy to generate continuous motion(2-4). Being actively driven, these materials are not constrained by the laws of equilibrium statistical mechanics and can thus exhibit sought-after properties such as autonomous motility, internally generated flows and self-organized beating(5-7). Here, starting from extensile microtubule bundles, we hierarchically assemble far-from-equilibrium analogues of conventional polymer gels, liquid crystals and emulsions. At high enough concentration, the microtubules form a percolating active network characterized by internally driven chaotic flows, hydrodynamic instabilities, enhanced transport and fluid mixing. When confined to emulsion droplets, three-dimensional networks spontaneously adsorb onto the droplet surfaces to produce highly active two-dimensional nematic liquid crystals whose streaming flows are controlled by internally generated fractures and self-healing, as well as unbinding and annihilation of oppositely charged disclination defects. The resulting active emulsions exhibit unexpected properties, such as autonomous motility, which are not observed in their passive analogues. Taken together, these observations exemplify how assemblages of animate microscopic objects exhibit collective biomimetic properties that are very different from those found in materials assembled from inanimate building blocks, challenging us to develop a theoretical framework that would allow for a systematic engineering of their far-from-equilibrium material properties.","Sanchez, Tim; Chen, Daniel T.

87,67,272.0,"Both genome content and deployment contribute to phenotypic differences between species(1-5). Sex is the most important difference between individuals in a species and has long been posited to be rapidly evolving. Indeed, in the Drosophila genus, traits such as sperm length, genitalia, and gonad size are the most obvious differences between species(6). Comparative analysis of sex-biased expression should deepen our understanding of the relationship between genome content and deployment during evolution. Using existing(7,8) and newly assembled genomes(9), we designed species-specific microarrays to examine sex-biased expression of orthologues and species-restricted genes in D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D. yakuba, D. ananassae, D. pseudoobscura, D. virilis and D. mojavensis. We show that averaged sex-biased expression changes accumulate monotonically over time within the genus. However, different genes contribute to expression variance within species groups compared to between groups. We observed greater turnover of species-restricted genes with male-biased expression, indicating that gene formation and extinction may play a significant part in species differences. Genes with male-biased expression also show the greatest expression and DNA sequence divergence. This higher divergence and turnover of genes with male-biased expression may be due to high transcription rates in the male germline, greater functional pleiotropy of genes expressed in females, and/or sexual competition.","Zhang, Yu; Sturgill, David; Parisi, Michael; Kumar, Sudhir; Oliver, Brian","Zhang, Y; Sturgill, D; Parisi, M; Kumar, S; Oliver, B",233.0,"NIDDKD, Cellular & Dev Biol Lab, NIH, US Dept HHS, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; Arizona State Univ, Ctr Evolutionary Funct Genom, Biodesign Inst, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06323,Article,,yuzhang@mail.nih.gov; oliver@helix.nih.gov,U2,"Intramural NIH HHS [Z01 DK015600-12]; NHGRI NIH HHS [R01 HG002516, R01 HG002516-04A1]",,228RC,,,RNA-POLYMERASE-II; EVOLUTIONARY SIGNIFICANCE; MELANOGASTER; MUTATION; GENOME; RATES; ACCUMULATION; DIVERGENCE; SELECTION; PROFILES,7167.0,NATURE,Nature,English,39.0,No,"Kumar, Sudhir/0000-0002-9918-8212","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",8-Nov,6.0,LONDON,17994089.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007.0,"Kumar, Sudhir/F-1411-2011","Zhang, Y (reprint author), NIDDKD, Cellular & Dev Biol Lab, NIH, US Dept HHS, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,168.0,Constraint and turnover in sex-biased gene expression in the genus Drosophila,2.0,38.0,WOS:000250746200044,272.0,450,Multidisciplinary Sciences,169,brian,oliver,9109.0,4600,male,1.0,gg3UPR8AAAAJ,3,"(4126, 9345]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
88,171,181.0,"The zonal wind in the tropical stratosphere switches between prevailing easterlies and westerlies with a period of about 28 months(1). In the lowermost stratosphere, the vertical structure of this quasibiennial oscillation (QBO) is linked to the mean upwelling(2-4), which itself is a key factor in determining stratospheric composition. Evidence for changes in the QBO have until now been equivocal, raising questions as to the extent of stratospheric circulation changes in a global warming context. Here we report an analysis of near-equatorial radiosonde observations for 1953-2012, and reveal a long-term trend of weakening amplitude in the zonal wind QBO in the tropical lower stratosphere. The trend is particularly notable at the 70-hectopascal pressure level (an altitude of about 19 kilometres), where the QBO amplitudes dropped by roughly one-third over the period. This trend is also apparent in the global warming simulations of the four models in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) that realistically simulate the QBO. The weakening is most reasonably explained as resulting from a trend of increased mean tropical upwelling in the lower stratosphere. Almost all comprehensive climate models have projected an intensifying tropical upwelling in global warming scenarios(5-7), but attempts to estimate changes in the upwelling by using observational data have yielded ambiguous, inconclusive or contradictory results(8-10). Our discovery of a weakening trend in the lower-stratosphere QBO amplitude provides strong support for the existence of a long-term trend of enhanced upwelling near the tropical tropopause.","Kawatani, Yoshio; Hamilton, Kevin","Kawatani, Y; Hamilton, K",478.0,"[Kawatani, Yoshio] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Res Inst Global Change, Kanazawa Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan; [Hamilton, Kevin] Univ Hawaii Manoa, SOEST, Int Pacific Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12140,Article,,yoskawatani@jamstec.go.jp,+,"Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology through International Pacific Research Center; Ministry of the Environment, Japan [A-1201]; JSPS KAKENHI [23740363, 24340113]; NASA [NNX07AG53G]; NOAA [NA11NMF4320128]; International Pacific Research Center; Data Integration and Analysis System (DIAS) Fund for National Key Technology from MEXT","This work was supported by the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology through its support of the International Pacific Research Center, by the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (A-1201) of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan and by JSPS KAKENHI grant nos 23740363 and 24340113.

89,106,307.0,"Cell division requires the precise coordination of chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. This coordination is achieved by the recruitment of an actomyosin regulator, Ect2, to overlapping microtubules at the centre of the elongating anaphase spindle(1). Ect2 then signals to the overlying cortex to promote the assembly and constriction of an actomyosin ring between segregating chromosomes(1). Here, by studying division in proliferating Drosophila and human cells, we demonstrate the existence of a second, parallel signalling pathway, which triggers the relaxation of the polar cell cortex at mid anaphase. This is independent of furrow formation, centrosomes and microtubules and, instead, depends on PP1 phosphatase and its regulatory subunit Sds22 (refs 2, 3). As separating chromosomes move towards the polar cortex at mid anaphase, kinetochore-localized PP1-Sds22 helps to break cortical symmetry by inducing the dephosphorylation and inactivation of ezrin/radixin/moesin proteins at cell poles. This promotes local softening of the cortex(2,3), facilitating anaphase elongation and orderly cell division. In summary, this identifies a conserved kinetochore-based phosphatase signal and substrate, which function together to link anaphase chromosome movements to cortical polarization, thereby coupling chromosome segregation to cell division.","Rodrigues, Nelio T.

90,28,253.0,"Acquisition of cell identity in plants relies strongly on positional information(1), hence cell-cell communication and inductive signalling are instrumental for developmental patterning. During Arabidopsis embryogenesis, an extra-embryonic cell is specified to become the founder cell of the primary root meristem, hypophysis, in response to signals from adjacent embryonic cells(2). The auxin-dependent transcription factor MONOPTEROS (MP) drives hypophysis specification by promoting transport of the hormone auxin from the embryo to the hypophysis precursor. However, auxin accumulation is not sufficient for hypophysis specification, indicating that additional MP-dependent signals are required(3). Here we describe the microarray-based isolation of MP target genes that mediate signalling from embryo to hypophysis. Of three direct transcriptional target genes, TARGET OF MP5 (TMO5) and TMO7 encode basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors that are expressed in the hypophysis-adjacent embryo cells, and are required and partially sufficient for MP-dependent root initiation. Importantly, the small TMO7 transcription factor moves from its site of synthesis in the embryo to the hypophysis precursor, thus representing a novel MP-dependent intercellular signal in embryonic root specification.","Schlereth, Alexandra; Moller, Barbara; Liu, Weilin; Kientz, Marika; Flipse, Jacky; Rademacher, Eike H.; Schmid, Markus; Juergens, Gerd; Weijers, Dolf","Schlereth, A; Moller, B; Liu, WL; Kientz, M; Flipse, J; Rademacher, EH; Schmid, M; Jurgens, G; Weijers, D",913.0,"[Schlereth, Alexandra; Kientz, Marika; Juergens, Gerd; Weijers, Dolf] Univ Tubingen, ZMBP, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Moller, Barbara; Liu, Weilin; Flipse, Jacky; Rademacher, Eike H.; Weijers, Dolf] Wageningen Univ, Biochem Lab, NL-6703 HA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Schmid, Markus] Max Planck Inst Dev Biol, Dept Mol Biol, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08836,Article,,gerd.juergens@zmbp.uni-tuebingen.de; dolf.weijers@wur.nl,U128,Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [VIDI 864.06.012]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [SFB446]; Netherlands Proteomics Centre (NPC),"We acknowledge P. van Oorschot, A. van Haperen and S.

91,141,20.0,"The life cycles of many parasites involve transitions between disparate host species, requiring these parasites to go through multiple developmental stages adapted to each of these specialized niches. Transmission of malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.) from humans to the mosquito vector requires differentiation from asexual stages replicating within red blood cells into non-dividing male and female gametocytes. Although gametocytes were first described in 1880, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in commitment to gametocyte formation is extremely limited, and disrupting this critical developmental transition remains a long-standing goal(1). Here we show that expression levels of the DNA-binding protein PfAP2-G correlate strongly with levels of gametocyte formation. Using independent forward and reverse genetics approaches, we demonstrate that PfAP2-G function is essential for parasite sexual differentiation. By combining genome-wide PfAP2-G cognate motif occurrence with global transcriptional changes resulting from PfAP2-G ablation, we identify early gametocyte genes as probable targets of PfAP2-G and show that their regulation by PfAP2-G is critical for their wild-type level expression. In the asexual blood-stage parasites pfap2-g appears to be among a set of epigenetically silenced loci(2,3) prone to spontaneous activation(4). Stochastic activation presents a simple mechanism for a low baseline of gametocyte production. Overall, these findings identify PfAP2-G as a master regulator of sexual-stage development in malaria parasites and mark the first discovery of a transcriptional switch controlling a differentiation decision in protozoan parasites.","Kafsack, Bjoern F.

Here we identify the antimicrobial peptide LL37 (also known as CAMP) as the key factor that mediates pDC activation in psoriasis, a common autoimmune disease of the skin. LL37 converts inert self-DNA into a potent trigger of interferon production by binding the DNA to form aggregated and condensed structures that are delivered to and retained within early endocytic compartments in pDCs to trigger Toll-like receptor 9. Thus, our data uncover a fundamental role of an endogenous antimicrobial peptide in breaking innate tolerance to self-DNA and suggest that this pathway may drive autoimmunity in psoriasis.","Lande, Roberto; Gregorio, Josh; Facchinetti, Valeria; Chatterjee, Bithi; Wang, Yi-Hong; Homey, Bernhard; Cao, Wei; Wang, Yui-Hsi; Su, Bing; Nestle, Frank O.; Zal, Tomasz; Mellman, Ira; Schroeder, Jens-Michael; Liu, Yong-Jun; Gilliet, Michel","Lande, R; Gregorio, J; Facchinetti, V; Chatterjee, B; Wang, YH; Homey, B; Cao, W; Wang, YH; Su, B; Nestle, FO; Zal, T; Mellman, I; Schroder, JM; Liu, YJ; Gilliet, M",564.0,"Univ Texas, MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Immunol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; Univ Texas, MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Melanoma Med Oncol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; Genentech Inc, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; Univ Dusseldorf, Dept Dermatol, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany; Kings Coll London Sch Med, St Johns Inst Dermatol, London SE1 9RT, England; Univ Kiel, Univ Hosp Schleswig Holstein, Dept Dermatol, D-24105 Kiel, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06116,Article,,mgilliet@mdanderson.org,U6,,,216QG,Y,N,SYSTEMIC-LUPUS-ERYTHEMATOSUS; TOLL-LIKE RECEPTORS; HUMAN SKIN; INNATE IMMUNITY; VERTEBRATE DNA; BACTERIAL-DNA; PSORIASIS; ALPHA; AUTOIMMUNITY; LL-37,7162.0,NATURE,Nature,English,42.0,No,"LANDE, ROBERTO/0000-0001-8398-4567; Cao, Wei/0000-0002-8952-9159","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",4-Oct,8.0,LONDON,17873860.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007.0,"Schroeder, Jens/B-3994-2009; LANDE, ROBERTO/B-9987-2016","Gilliet, M (reprint author), Univ Texas, MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Immunol, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,840.0,Plasmacytoid dendritic cells sense self-DNA coupled with antimicrobial peptide,6.0,67.0,WOS:000249893500037,360.0,449,Multidisciplinary Sciences,879,michel,gilliet,16627.0,729,male,0.96,LO2b5k4AAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
93,167,80.0,"53BP1 (also called TP53BP1) is a chromatin-associated factor that promotes immunoglobulin class switching and DNA double-strand-break (DSB) repair by non-homologous end joining. To accomplish its function in DNA repair, 53BP1 accumulates at DSB sites downstream of the RNF168 ubiquitin ligase. How ubiquitin recruits 53BP1 to break sites remains unknown as its relocalization involves recognition of histone H4 Lys 20 (H4K20) methylation by its Tudor domain. Here we elucidate how vertebrate 53BP1 is recruited to the chromatin that flanks DSB sites. We show that 53BP1 recognizes mononucleosomes containing dimethylated H4K20 (H4K20me2) and H2A ubiquitinated on Lys 15 (H2AK15ub), the latter being a product of RNF168 action on chromatin. 53BP1 binds to nucleosomes minimally as a dimer using its previously characterized methyl-lysine-binding Tudor domain and a carboxy-terminal extension, termed the ubiquitination-dependent recruitment (UDR) motif, which interacts with the epitope formed by H2AK15ub and its surrounding residues on the H2A tail. 53BP1 is therefore a bivalent histone modification reader that recognizes a histone 'code' produced by DSB signalling.","Fradet-Turcotte, Amelie; Canny, Marella D.; Escribano-Diaz, Cristina; Orthwein, Alexandre; Leung, Charles C.

94,3,76.0,"X-ray lasers offer new capabilities in understanding the structure of biological systems, complex materials and matter under extreme conditions(1-4). Very short and extremely bright, coherent X-ray pulses can be used to outrun key damage processes and obtain a single diffraction pattern from a large macromolecule, a virus or a cell before the sample explodes and turns into plasma(1). The continuous diffraction pattern of non-crystalline objects permits oversampling and direct phase retrieval(2). Here we show that high-quality diffraction data can be obtained with a single X-ray pulse from a noncrystalline biological sample, a single mimivirus particle, which was injected into the pulsed beam of a hard-X-ray free-electron laser, the Linac Coherent Light Source(5). Calculations indicate that the energy deposited into the virus by the pulse heated the particle to over 100,000 K after the pulse had left the sample. The reconstructed exit wavefront (image) yielded 32-nm full-period resolution in a single exposure and showed no measurable damage. The reconstruction indicates inhomogeneous arrangement of dense material inside the virion. We expect that significantly higher resolutions will be achieved in such experiments with shorter and brighter photon pulses focused to a smaller area. The resolution in such experiments can be further extended for samples available in multiple identical copies.","Seibert, M. Marvin; Ekeberg, Tomas; Maia, Filipe R. N.

95,163,5.0,"Some evolutionary innovations may originate non-adaptively as exaptations, or pre-adaptations, which are by-products of other adaptive traits(1-5). Examples include feathers, which originated before they were used in flight(2), and lens crystallins, which are light-refracting proteins that originated as enzymes(6). The question of how often adaptive traits have non-adaptive origins has profound implications for evolutionary biology, but is difficult to address systematically. Here we consider this issue in metabolism, one of the most ancient biological systems that is central to all life. We analyse a metabolic trait of great adaptive importance: the ability of a metabolic reaction network to synthesize all biomass from a single source of carbon and energy. We use novel computational methods to sample randomly many metabolic networks that can sustain life on any given carbon source but contain an otherwise random set of known biochemical reactions. We show that when we require such networks to be viable on one particular carbon source, they are typically also viable on multiple other carbon sources that were not targets of selection. For example, viability on glucose may entail viability on up to 44 other sole carbon sources. Any one adaptation in these metabolic systems typically entails multiple potential exaptations. Metabolic systems thus contain a latent potential for evolutionary innovations with non-adaptive origins. Our observations suggest that many more metabolic traits may have non-adaptive origins than is appreciated at present. They also challenge our ability to distinguish adaptive from non-adaptive traits.","Barve, Aditya; Wagner, Andreas","Barve, A; Wagner, A",203.0,"[Barve, Aditya; Wagner, Andreas] Univ Zurich, Inst Evolutionary Biol & Environm Sci, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Barve, Aditya; Wagner, Andreas] Swiss Inst Bioinformat, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Wagner, Andreas] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12301,Article,1476-4687,andreas.wagner@ieu.uzh.ch,+,Swiss National Science Foundation [315230-129708],"We thank K.

Here we monitored the spatiotemporal dynamics of CaMKII activation in individual dendritic spines during LTP using two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, in combination with two-photon glutamate uncaging. Induction of LTP and associated spine enlargement in single spines triggered transient (similar to 1 min) CaMKII activation restricted to the stimulated spines. CaMKII in spines was specifically activated by NMDA receptors and L-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels, presumably by nanodomain Ca(2+) near the channels, in response to glutamate uncaging and depolarization, respectively. The high degree of compartmentalization and channel specificity of CaMKII signalling allow stimuli-specific spatiotemporal patterns of CaMKII signalling and may be important for synapse-specificity of synaptic plasticity.","Lee, Seok-Jin R.; Escobedo-Lozoya, Yasmin; Szatmari, Erzsebet M.; Yasuda, Ryohei","Lee, SJR; Escobedo-Lozoya, Y; Szatmari, EM; Yasuda, R",299.0,"[Lee, Seok-Jin R.; Escobedo-Lozoya, Yasmin; Szatmari, Erzsebet M.; Yasuda, Ryohei] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Neurobiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07842,Article,,yasuda@neuro.duke.edu,U58,Burroughs Wellcome Fund; Dana Foundation; Alfred P.

97,70,402.0,"Ferroelectric thin films and superlattices are currently the subject of intensive research(1,2) because of the interest they raise for technological applications and also because their properties are of fundamental scientific importance(3-5). Ferroelectric superlattices(6) allow the tuning of the ferroelectric properties while maintaining perfect crystal structure and a coherent strain, even throughout relatively thick samples. This tuning is achieved in practice by adjusting both the strain(7-10), to enhance the polarization, and the composition, to interpolate between the properties of the combined compounds(11-15). Here we show that superlattices with very short periods possess a new form of interface coupling, based on rotational distortions, which gives rise to 'improper' ferroelectricity. These observations suggest an approach, based on interface engineering, to produce artificial materials with unique properties. By considering ferroelectric/paraelectric PbTiO3/SrTiO3 multilayers, we first show from first principles that the groundstate of the system is not purely ferroelectric but also primarily involves antiferrodistortive rotations of the oxygen atoms in a way compatible with improper ferroelectricity. We then demonstrate experimentally that, in contrast to pure PbTiO3 and SrTiO3 compounds, the multilayer system indeed behaves like a prototypical improper ferroelectric and exhibits a very large dielectric constant of epsilon(r)approximate to 600, which is also fairly temperature-independent. This behaviour, of practical interest for technological applications(16), is distinct from that of normal ferroelectrics, for which the dielectric constant is typically large but strongly evolves around the phase transition temperature and also differs from that of previously known improper ferroelectrics that exhibit a temperature-independent but small dielectric constant only.","Bousquet, Eric; Dawber, Matthew; Stucki, Nicolas; Lichtensteiger, Celine; Hermet, Patrick; Gariglio, Stefano; Triscone, Jean-Marc; Ghosez, Philippe","Bousquet, E; Dawber, M; Stucki, N; Lichtensteiger, C; Hermet, P; Gariglio, S; Triscone, JM; Ghosez, P",732.0,"[Bousquet, Eric; Hermet, Patrick; Ghosez, Philippe] Univ Liege, B-4000 Sart Tilman Par Liege, Belgium; [Dawber, Matthew; Stucki, Nicolas; Lichtensteiger, Celine; Gariglio, Stefano; Triscone, Jean-Marc] Univ Geneva, DPMC, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06817,Article,,matthew.dawber@stonybrook.edu; philippe.ghosez@ulg.ac.be,U4,,,285QY,Y,N,THIN-FILMS; POLARIZATION ENHANCEMENT; 1ST-PRINCIPLES; BATIO3; SRTIO3,7188.0,NATURE,Nature,English,35.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",10-Apr,6.0,LONDON,18401406.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,"Ghosez, Philippe/F-1954-2014","Ghosez, P (reprint author), Univ Liege, Allee 6 Aout 17 B5, B-4000 Sart Tilman Par Liege, Belgium.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,415.0,Improper ferroelectricity in perovskite oxide artificial superlattices,31.0,364.0,WOS:000254792500041,402.0,452,Multidisciplinary Sciences,417,philippe,ghosez,14131.0,605,male,0.99,bKwqdp4AAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
98,128,221.0,"Magma fluxes regulate the planetary thermal budget, the growth of continents and the frequency and magnitude of volcanic eruptions, and play a part in the genesis and size of magmatic ore deposits(1-4). However, because a large fraction of the magma produced on the Earth does not erupt at the surface(2,5), determinations of magma fluxes are rare and this compromises our ability to establish a link between global heat transfer and large-scale geological processes. Here we show that age distributions of zircons, a mineral often present in crustal magmatic rocks(6), in combination with thermal modelling, provide an accurate means of retrieving magma fluxes. The characteristics of zircon age populations vary significantly and systematically as a function of the flux and total volume of magma accumulated in the Earth's crust. Our approach produces results that are consistent with independent determinations of magma fluxes and volumes of magmatic systems. Analysis of existing age population data sets using our method suggests that porphyry-type deposits, plutons and large eruptions each require magma input over different timescales at different characteristic average fluxes. We anticipate that more extensive and complete magma flux data sets will serve to clarify the control that the global heat flux exerts on the frequency of geological events such as volcanic eruptions, and to determine the main factors controlling the distribution of resources on our planet.","Caricchi, Luca; Simpson, Guy; Schaltegger, Urs","Caricchi, L; Simpson, G; Schaltegger, U",457.0,"[Caricchi, Luca; Simpson, Guy; Schaltegger, Urs] Univ Geneva, Sect Earth & Environm Sci, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13532,Article,1476-4687,luca.caricchi@unige.ch,+,University of Geneva; Swiss National Science Foundation,"We thank C.

99,83,268.0,"RNA polymerase (Pol) II catalyses DNA-dependent RNA synthesis during gene transcription. There is, however, evidence that Pol II also possesses RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) activity. Pol II can use a homopolymeric RNA template(1), can extend RNA by several nucleotides in the absence of DNA(2), and has been implicated in the replication of the RNA genomes of hepatitis delta virus (HDV)(3,4) and plant viroids(5). Here we show the intrinsic RdRP activity of Pol II with only pure polymerase, an RNA template-product scaffold and nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs). Crystallography reveals the template-product duplex in the site occupied by the DNA-RNA hybrid during transcription. RdRP activity resides at the active site used during transcription, but it is slower and less processive than DNA-dependent activity. RdRP activity is also obtained with part of the HDV antigenome. The complex of transcription factor IIS (TFIIS) with Pol II can cleave one HDV strand, create a reactive stem-loop in the hybrid site, and extend the new RNA 3' end. Short RNA stem-loops with a 5' extension suffice for activity, but their growth to a critical length apparently impairs processivity. The RdRP activity of Pol II provides a missing link in molecular evolution, because it suggests that Pol II evolved from an ancient replicase that duplicated RNA genomes.","Lehmann, Elisabeth; Brueckner, Florian; Cramer, Patrick","Lehmann, E; Brueckner, F; Cramer, P",445.0,"Univ Munich, Gene Ctr Munich, D-81377 Munich, Germany; Univ Munich, Ctr Integrated Prot Sci, Dept Chem & Biochem, D-81377 Munich, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06290,Article,,cramer@LMB.uni-muenchen.de,449,,,231AM,,,HEPATITIS-DELTA ANTIGEN; ELONGATION COMPLEX; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; STRUCTURAL BASIS; LID ELEMENT; DNA HYBRID; IN-VITRO; TRANSCRIPTION; TFIIS; ARCHITECTURE,7168.0,NATURE,Nature,English,24.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",15-Nov,5.0,LONDON,18004386.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007.0,,"Cramer, P (reprint author), Univ Munich, Gene Ctr Munich, Feodor Lynen Str 25, D-81377 Munich, Germany.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,76.0,Molecular basis of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase II activity,0.0,2.0,WOS:000250918600060,268.0,450,Multidisciplinary Sciences,77,patrick,cramer,14443.0,2877,male,1.0,NKjlhVQAAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",4239803,1,4239803,1,Patrick Cramer,Patrick Cramer,1,1
100,212,462.0,"In many organisms, developmentally programmed double-strand breaks (DSBs) formed by the SPO11 transesterase initiate meiotic recombination, which promotes pairing and segregation of homologous chromosomes(1). Because every chromosome must receive a minimum number of DSBs, attention has focused on factors that support DSB formation(2). However, improperly repaired DSBs can cause meiotic arrest or mutation(3,4); thus, having too many DSBs is probably as deleterious as having too few. Only a small fraction of SPO11 protein ever makes a DSB in yeast or mouse(5) and SPO11 and its accessory factors remain abundant long after most DSB formation ceases(1), implying the existence of mechanisms that restrain SPO11 activity to limit DSB numbers. Here we report that the number of meiotic DSBs in mouse is controlled by ATM, a kinase activated by DNA damage to trigger checkpoint signalling and promote DSB repair. Levels of SPO11-oligonucleotide complexes, by-products of meiotic DSB formation, are elevated at least tenfold in spermatocytes lacking ATM. Moreover, Atm mutation renders SPO11-oligonucleotide levels sensitive to genetic manipulations that modulate SPO11 protein levels. We propose that ATM restrains SPO11 via a negative feedback loop in which kinase activation by DSBs suppresses further DSB formation. Our findings explain previously puzzling phenotypes of Atm-null mice and provide a molecular basis for the gonadal dysgenesis observed in ataxia telangiectasia, the human syndrome caused by ATM deficiency.","Lange, Julian; Pan, Jing; Cole, Francesca; Thelen, Michael P.; Jasin, Maria; Keeney, Scott","Lange, J; Pan, J; Cole, F; Thelen, MP; Jasin, M; Keeney, S",237.0,"[Lange, Julian; Pan, Jing; Keeney, Scott] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Program Mol Biol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Cole, Francesca; Jasin, Maria] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dev Biol Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Thelen, Michael P.] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Phys & Life Sci Directorate, Livermore, CA 94550 USA; [Keeney, Scott] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10065 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10508,Article,,m-jasin@ski.mskcc.org; s-keeney@ski.mskcc.org,U117,"NIH [HD040916, HD053855, GM058673]; Leukemia and Lymphoma Society; Ruth L.

101,77,159.0,"Understanding the transmission of sensory information at individual synaptic connections requires knowledge of the properties of presynaptic terminals and their patterns of firing evoked by sensory stimuli. Such information has been difficult to obtain because of the small size and inaccessibility of nerve terminals in the central nervous system. Here we show, by making direct patch- clamp recordings in vivo from cerebellar mossy fibre boutons - the primary source of synaptic input to the cerebellar cortex(1,2) - that sensory stimulation can produce bursts of spikes in single boutons at very high instantaneous firing frequencies ( more than 700 Hz). We show that the mossy fibre - granule cell synapse exhibits high- fidelity transmission at these frequencies, indicating that the rapid burst of excitatory postsynaptic currents underlying the sensory- evoked response of granule cells(3) can be driven by such a presynaptic spike burst. We also demonstrate that a single mossy fibre can trigger action potential bursts in granule cells in vitro when driven with in vivo firing patterns. These findings suggest that the relay from mossy fibre to granule cell can act in a 'detonator' fashion, such that a single presynaptic afferent may be sufficient to transmit the sensory message. This endows the cerebellar mossy fibre system with remarkable sensitivity and high fidelity in the transmission of sensory information.","Rancz, Ede A.; Ishikawa, Taro; Duguid, Ian; Chadderton, Paul; Mahon, Severine; Haeusser, Michael","Rancz, EA; Ishikawa, T; Duguid, I; Chadderton, P; Mahon, S; Hausser, M",1245.0,"UCL, Wolfson Inst Biomed Res, London WC1E 6BT, England; UCL, Dept Physiol, London WC1E 6BT, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature05995,Article,,m.hausser@ucl.ac.uk,U12,"Wellcome Trust [, 068699]",,243HA,,,GRANULE CELL LAYER; IN-VIVO; PURKINJE-CELLS; RAT; RESPONSES; SYNAPSE; CORTEX; BRAIN; INTEGRATION; MORPHOLOGY,7173.0,NATURE,Nature,English,33.0,No,"Rancz, Ede Attila/0000-0002-7951-1385; Chadderton, Paul/0000-0002-6276-1011","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",20-Dec,5.0,LONDON,18097412.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007.0,"Mahon, Severine/E-7195-2017","Hausser, M (reprint author), UCL, Wolfson Inst Biomed Res, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,153.0,High-fidelity transmission of sensory information by single cerebellar mossy fibre boutons,1.0,11.0,WOS:000251786200053,159.0,450,Multidisciplinary Sciences,154,michael,haeusser,14605.0,11094,male,1.0,yhMNQoQAAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
102,87,419.0,"Genetic imprinting, found in flowering plants and placental mammals, uses DNA methylation to yield gene expression that is dependent on the parent of origin(1). DNA methyltransferase 3a (Dnmt3a) and its regulatory factor, DNA methyltransferase 3-like protein (Dnmt3L), are both required for the de novo DNA methylation of imprinted genes in mammalian germ cells. Dnmt3L interacts specifically with unmethylated lysine 4 of histone H3 through its amino-terminal PHD (plant homeodomain)-like domain(2). Here we show, with the use of crystallography, that the carboxy-terminal domain of human Dnmt3L interacts with the catalytic domain of Dnmt3a, demonstrating that Dnmt3L has dual functions of binding the unmethylated histone tail and activating DNA methyltransferase. The complexed C-terminal domains of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3L showed further dimerization through Dnmt3a-Dnmt3a interaction, forming a tetrameric complex with two active sites. Substitution of key non-catalytic residues at the Dnmt3a-Dnmt3L interface or the Dnmt3a-Dnmt3a interface eliminated enzymatic activity. Molecular modelling of a DNA Dnmt3a dimer indicated that the two active sites are separated by about one DNA helical turn. The C-terminal domain of Dnmt3a oligomerizes on DNA to form a nucleoprotein filament. A periodicity in the activity of Dnmt3a on long DNA revealed a correlation of methylated CpG sites at distances of eight to ten base pairs, indicating that oligomerization leads Dnmt3a to methylate DNA in a periodic pattern. A similar periodicity is observed for the frequency of CpG sites in the differentially methylated regions of 12 maternally imprinted mouse genes. These results suggest a basis for the recognition and methylation of differentially methylated regions in imprinted genes, involving the detection of both nucleosome modification and CpG spacing.","Jia, Da; Jurkowska, Renata Z.; Zhang, Xing; Jeltsch, Albert; Cheng, Xiaodong","Jia, D; Jurkowska, RZ; Zhang, X; Jeltsch, A; Cheng, XD",248.0,"Jacobs Univ Bremen, Sch Sci & Engn, Biochem Lab, D-28759 Bremen, Germany; Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06146,Article,1476-4687,a.jeltsch@jacobs-university.de; xcheng@emory.edu,U13,"NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM049245, R01 GM049245-14]",,209NF,,,HISTONE MODIFICATIONS; MOUSE; REGIONS; METHYLTRANSFERASES; SPERMATOGENESIS; STIMULATION; MECHANISM; IGF2R; MARKS,7159.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,"Jeltsch, Albert/0000-0001-6113-9290","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",13-Sep,6.0,LONDON,17713477.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007.0,"Jeltsch, Albert/O-7404-2014","Jeltsch, A (reprint author), Jacobs Univ Bremen, Sch Sci & Engn, Biochem Lab, D-28759 Bremen, Germany.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,422.0,Structure of Dnmt3a bound to Dnmt3L suggests a model for de novo DNA methylation,3.0,57.0,WOS:000249394500056,419.0,449,Multidisciplinary Sciences,441,xiaodong,cheng,14048.0,1,male,1.0,fg3sXKwAAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",52921414,1,14170890,1,The Great Detective (film),The Great Detective (film),0,0
103,200,93.0,"Empirical data indicate that sexual preferences are critical for maintaining species boundaries(1-4), yet theoretical work has suggested that, on their own, they can have only a minimal role in maintaining biodiversity(5-9). This is because long-term coexistence within overlapping ranges is thought to be unlikely in the absence of ecological differentiation(9). Here we challenge this widely held view by generalizing a standard model of sexual selection to include two ubiquitous features of populations with sexual selection: spatial variation in local carrying capacity, and mate-search costs in females. We show that, when these two features are combined, sexual preferences can single-handedly maintain coexistence, even when spatial variation in local carrying capacity is so slight that it might go unnoticed empirically. This theoretical study demonstrates that sexual selection alone can promote the long-term coexistence of ecologically equivalent species with overlapping ranges, and it thus provides a novel explanation for the maintenance of species diversity.","M'Gonigle, Leithen K.; Mazzucco, Rupert; Otto, Sarah P.; Dieckmann, Ulf","M'Gonigle, LK; Mazzucco, R; Otto, SP; Dieckmann, U",506.0,"[M'Gonigle, Leithen K.; Otto, Sarah P.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Mazzucco, Rupert; Dieckmann, Ulf] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Evolut & Ecol Program, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10971,Article,,mgonigle@zoology.ubc.ca,509,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (Canada); European Science Foundation; WWTF; European Commission; Austrian Science Fund; Austrian Ministry of Science and Research,"We thank J.

104,7,123.0,"Electrons moving in two dimensions under the influence of strong magnetic fields effectively lose their kinetic energy and display exotic behaviour dominated by Coulomb forces. When the ratio of electrons to magnetic flux quanta in the system (nu) is near 5/2, the electrons are predicted to condense into a correlated phase with fractionally charged quasiparticles and a ground-state degeneracy that grows exponentially as these quasiparticles are introduced(1). The only way for electrons to transform between the many ground states would be to braid the fractional excitations around each other. This property has been proposed as the basis of a fault-tolerant quantum computer(2). Here we present observations of localized quasiparticles at nu = 5/2, confined to puddles by disorder. Using a local electrometer to compare how quasiparticles at nu = 5/2 and nu = 7/3 charge these puddles, we were able to extract the ratio of local charges for these states. Averaged over several disorder configurations and samples, we found the ratio to be 4/3, suggesting that the local charges are e(7/3)* = e/3 and e(5/2)* = e/4, where e is the charge of an electron. This is in agreement with theoretical predictions for a paired state at nu = 5/2. Confirming the existence of localized e/4 quasiparticles shows that proposed interferometry experiments to test statistics and computational ability of the state at nu = 5/2 would be possible.","Venkatachalam, Vivek; Yacoby, Amir; Pfeiffer, Loren; West, Ken","Venkatachalam, V; Yacoby, A; Pfeiffer, L; West, K",185.0,"[Venkatachalam, Vivek; Yacoby, Amir] Harvard Univ, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Pfeiffer, Loren; West, Ken] Princeton Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09680,Article,,yacoby@physics.harvard.edu,188,Microsoft Corporation; National Science Foundation,"We would like to acknowledge B.

105,40,28.0,"Rydberg atoms have an electron in a state with a very high principal quantum number, and as a result can exhibit unusually long-range interactions. One example is the bonding of two such atoms by multipole forces to form Rydberg-Rydberg molecules with very large internuclear distances(1-3). Notably, bonding interactions can also arise from the low-energy scattering of a Rydberg electron with negative scattering length from a ground-state atom(4,5). In this case, the scattering-induced attractive interaction binds the ground-state atom to the Rydberg atom at a well-localized position within the Rydberg electron wavefunction and thereby yields giant molecules that can have internuclear separations of several thousand Bohr radii(6-8). Here we report the spectroscopic characterization of such exotic molecular states formed by rubidium Rydberg atoms that are in the spherically symmetric s state and have principal quantum numbers, n, between 34 and 40. We find that the spectra of the vibrational ground state and of the first excited state of the Rydberg molecule, the rubidium dimer Rb(5s)-Rb(ns), agree well with simple model predictions. The data allow us to extract the s-wave scattering length for scattering between the Rydberg electron and the ground-state atom, Rb(5s), in the low-energy regime (kinetic energy, <100meV), and to determine the lifetimes and the polarizabilities of the Rydberg molecules. Given our successful characterization of s-wave bound Rydberg states, we anticipate that p-wave bound states(9), trimer states(10) and bound states involving a Rydberg electron with large angular momentum-so-called trilobite molecules(5)-will also be realized and directly probed in the near future.","Bendkowsky, Vera; Butscher, Bjoern; Nipper, Johannes; Shaffer, James P.; Loew, Robert; Pfau, Tilman","Bendkowsky, V; Butscher, B; Nipper, J; Shaffer, JP; Low, R; Pfau, T",1005.0,"[Bendkowsky, Vera; Butscher, Bjoern; Nipper, Johannes; Shaffer, James P.; Loew, Robert; Pfau, Tilman] Univ Stuttgart, Phys Inst 5, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany; [Shaffer, James P.] Univ Oklahoma, Homer L Dodge Dept Phys & Astron, Norman, OK 73072 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07945,Article,,v.bendkowsky@physik.uni-stuttgart.de; t.pfau@physik.uni-stuttgart.de,U76,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [PF 381/4-1]; Landesstiftung Baden-Wurttemberg; Carl Zeiss foundation; Alexander von Humboldt foundation,"We would like to thank C.

106,161,471.0,"Mutualistic networks are formed when the interactions between two classes of species are mutually beneficial. They are important examples of cooperation shaped by evolution. Mutualism between animals and plants has a key role in the organization of ecological communities(1-3). Such networks in ecology have generally evolved a nested architecture(4,5) independent of species composition and latitude(6,7); specialist species, with only few mutualistic links, tend to interact with a proper subset of the many mutualistic partners of any of the generalist species(1). Despite sustained efforts(5,8-10) to explain observed network structure on the basis of community-level stability or persistence, such correlative studies have reached minimal consensus(11-13). Here we show that nested interaction networks could emerge as a consequence of an optimization principle aimed at maximizing the species abundance in mutualistic communities. Using analytical and numerical approaches, we show that because of the mutualistic interactions, an increase in abundance of a given species results in a corresponding increase in the total number of individuals in the community, and also an increase in the nestedness of the interaction matrix. Indeed, the species abundances and the nestedness of the interaction matrix are correlated by a factor that depends on the strength of the mutualistic interactions. Nestedness and the observed spontaneous emergence of generalist and specialist species occur for several dynamical implementations of the variational principle under stationary conditions. Optimized networks, although remaining stable, tend to be less resilient than their counterparts with randomly assigned interactions. In particular, we show analytically that the abundance of the rarest species is linked directly to the resilience of the community. Our work provides a unifying framework for studying the emergent structural and dynamical properties of ecological mutualistic networks(2,5,10,14).","Suweis, Samir; Simini, Filippo; Banavar, Jayanth R.; Maritan, Amos","Suweis, S; Simini, F; Banavar, JR; Maritan, A",449.0,"[Suweis, Samir; Maritan, Amos] Univ Padua, Ist Nazl Fis Nucl, Dipartimento Fis & Astron G Galilei, I-35131 Padua, Italy; [Suweis, Samir; Maritan, Amos] Univ Padua, Ist Nazl Fis Nucl, CNISM, I-35131 Padua, Italy; [Simini, Filippo] Northeastern Univ, Ctr Complex Network Res, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Simini, Filippo] Northeastern Univ, Dept Phys Biol & Comp Sci, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Simini, Filippo] Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Inst Phys, H-1111 Budapest, Hungary; [Banavar, Jayanth R.] Univ Maryland, Dept Phys, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12438,Article,,suweis@pd.infn.it; amos.maritan@pd.infn.it,452,Cariparo foundation,"A.M. and S.S. acknowledge the Cariparo foundation for financial support.

Known as the Warburg effect in the context of cancer growth, this phenomenon occurs ubiquitously for fast-growing cells, including bacteria, fungi and mammalian cells, but its origin has remained unclear despite decades of research. Here we study metabolic overflow in Escherichia coli, and show that it is a global physiological response used to cope with changing proteomic demands of energy biogenesis and biomass synthesis under different growth conditions. A simple model of proteomic resource allocation can quantitatively account for all of the observed behaviours, and accurately predict responses to new perturbations. The key hypothesis of the model, that the proteome cost of energy biogenesis by respiration exceeds that by fermentation, is quantitatively confirmed by direct measurement of protein abundances via quantitative mass spectrometry.","Basan, Markus; Hui, Sheng; Okano, Hiroyuki; Zhang, Zhongge; Shen, Yang; Williamson, James R.; Hwa, Terence","Basan, M; Hui, S; Okano, H; Zhang, ZG; Shen, Y; Williamson, JR; Hwa, T",99.0,"[Basan, Markus; Hui, Sheng; Okano, Hiroyuki; Hwa, Terence] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Phys, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Basan, Markus] ETH, Inst Mol Syst Biol, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Okano, Hiroyuki; Zhang, Zhongge; Shen, Yang; Hwa, Terence] Univ Calif San Diego, Mol Biol Sect, Div Biol Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Williamson, James R.] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Chem, Skaggs Inst Chem Biol, Dept Integrat Struct & Computat Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Hwa, Terence] ETH, Inst Theoret Studies, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15765,Article,1476-4687,hwa@ucsd.edu,+,"NIH [R01-GM109069]; Simons Foundation [330378]; M.

108,178,468.0,"The recent decades-long decline in East African rainfall(1) suggests that multidecadal variability is an important component of the climate of this vulnerable region. Prior work based on analysing the instrumental record implicates both Indian(2) and Pacific(1) ocean sea surface temperatures (SSTs) as possible drivers of East African multidecadal climate variability, but the short length of the instrumental record precludes a full elucidation of the underlying physical mechanisms. Here we show that on timescales beyond the decadal, the Indian Ocean drives East African rainfall variability by altering the local Walker circulation, whereas the influence of the Pacific Ocean is minimal. Our results, based on proxy indicators of relative moisture balance for the past millennium paired with long control simulations from coupled climate models, reveal that moist conditions in coastal East Africa are associated with cool SSTs (and related descending circulation) in the eastern Indian Ocean and ascending circulation over East Africa. The most prominent event identified in the proxy record-a coastal pluvial from 1680 to 1765-occurred when Indo-Pacific warm pool SSTs reached their minimum values of the past millennium. Taken together, the proxy and model evidence suggests that Indian Ocean SSTs are the primary influence on East African rainfall over multidecadal and perhaps longer timescales.","Tierney, Jessica E.; Smerdon, Jason E.; Anchukaitis, Kevin J.; Seager, Richard","Tierney, JE; Smerdon, JE; Anchukaitis, KJ; Seager, R",389.0,"[Tierney, Jessica E.; Anchukaitis, Kevin J.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Tierney, Jessica E.; Smerdon, Jason E.; Anchukaitis, Kevin J.; Seager, Richard] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11785,Article,,tierney@whoi.edu,392,"US NOAA; NSF [OCE-1203892]; NOAA [NA10OAR431037]; Office of Science, US Department of Energy; US NSF","J.E.T. acknowledges the US NOAA Climate and Global Change Postdoctoral Fellowship and NSF OCE-1203892 for support.

109,1,47.0,"One billion people depend on seafood as their primary source of protein and 25% of the world's total animal protein comes from fisheries(1). Yet a third of fish stocks worldwide are overexploited or depleted(1,2). Using individual case studies, many have argued that community-based co-management(3) should prevent the tragedy of the commons(4) because cooperative management by fishers, managers and scientists often results in sustainable fisheries(3,5,6). However, general and multidisciplinary evaluations of co-management regimes and the conditions for social, economic and ecological success within such regimes are lacking. Here we examine 130 co-managed fisheries in a wide range of countries with different degrees of development, ecosystems, fishing sectors and type of resources. We identified strong leadership as the most important attribute contributing to success, followed by individual or community quotas, social cohesion and protected areas. Less important conditions included enforcement mechanisms, long-term management policies and life history of the resources. Fisheries were most successful when at least eight co-management attributes were present, showing a strong positive relationship between the number of these attributes and success, owing to redundancy in management regulations. Our results demonstrate the critical importance of prominent community leaders and robust social capital(7), combined with clear incentives through catch shares and conservation benefits derived from protected areas, for successfully managing aquatic resources and securing the livelihoods of communities depending on them. Our study offers hope that co-management, the only realistic solution for the majority of the world's fisheries, can solve many of the problems facing global fisheries.","Gutierrez, Nicolas L.; Hilborn, Ray; Defeo, Omar","Gutierrez, NL; Hilborn, R; Defeo, O",386.0,"[Gutierrez, Nicolas L.; Hilborn, Ray] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Defeo, Omar] Fac Ciencias, UNDECIMAR, Montevideo 11400, Uruguay",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09689,Article,,nicolasg@uw.edu,389,National Science Foundation [0308440]; Fulbright-OAS Initiative in Ecology; Pew Charitable Trusts,"N.L.G. was partially funded by the National Science Foundation (award 0308440) and a Fulbright-OAS Initiative in Ecology fellowship.

Structural studies have identified phospholipids as potential LRH-1 ligands(3-5), but their functional relevance is unclear. Here we show that an unusual phosphatidylcholine species with two saturated 12 carbon fatty acid acyl side chains (dilauroyl phosphatidylcholine (DLPC)) is an LRH-1 agonist ligand in vitro. DLPC treatment induces bile acid biosynthetic enzymes in mouse liver, increases bile acid levels, and lowers hepatic triglycerides and serum glucose. DLPC treatment also decreases hepatic steatosis and improves glucose homeostasis in two mouse models of insulin resistance. Both the antidiabetic and lipotropic effects are lost in liver-specific Lrh-1 knockouts. These findings identify an LRH-1 dependent phosphatidylcholine signalling pathway that regulates bile acid metabolism and glucose homeostasis.","Lee, Jae Man; Lee, Yoon Kwang; Mamrosh, Jennifer L.; Busby, Scott A.; Griffin, Patrick R.; Pathak, Manish C.; Ortlund, Eric A.; Moore, David D.","Lee, JM; Lee, YK; Mamrosh, JL; Busby, SA; Griffin, PR; Pathak, MC; Ortlund, EA; Moore, DD",506.0,"[Lee, Jae Man; Moore, David D.] Baylor Coll Med, Program Dev Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Lee, Yoon Kwang; Mamrosh, Jennifer L.; Moore, David D.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Lee, Yoon Kwang] Northeastern Ohio Univ Coll Med & Pharm, Dept Integrat Med Sci, Coll Med, Rootstown, OH 44272 USA; [Lee, Yoon Kwang] Northeastern Ohio Univ Coll Med & Pharm, Coll Pharm, Rootstown, OH 44272 USA; [Busby, Scott A.; Griffin, Patrick R.] Scripps Res Inst, Scripps Res Mol Screening Ctr, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA; [Pathak, Manish C.; Ortlund, Eric A.] Emory Univ, Dept Biochem, Sch Med, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10111,Article,,moore@bcm.edu,U135,"NIH [DK-079638, DK068804, R01 CA134873]; USDA [ARS 6250-52000-055]; Alkek Foundation; Robert R.

111,219,260.0,"The primate lentivirus auxiliary protein Vpx counteracts an unknown restriction factor that renders human dendritic and myeloid cells largely refractory to HIV-1 infection(1-6). Here we identify SAMHD1 as this restriction factor. SAMHD1 is a protein involved in Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome, a genetic encephalopathy with symptoms mimicking congenital viral infection, that has been proposed to act as a negative regulator of the interferon response(7). We show that Vpx induces proteasomal degradation of SAMHD1. Silencing of SAMHD1 in non-permissive cell lines alleviates HIV-1 restriction and is associated with a significant accumulation of viral DNA in infected cells. Concurrently, overexpression of SAMHD1 in sensitive cells inhibits HIV-1 infection. The putative phosphohydrolase activity of SAMHD1 is probably required for HIV-1 restriction. Vpx-mediated relief of restriction is abolished in SAMHD1-negative cells. Finally, silencing of SAMHD1 markedly increases the susceptibility of monocytic-derived dendritic cells to infection. Our results demonstrate that SAMHD1 is an antiretroviral protein expressed in cells of the myeloid lineage that inhibits an early step of the viral life cycle.","Laguette, Nadine; Sobhian, Bijan; Casartelli, Nicoletta; Ringeard, Mathieu; Chable-Bessia, Christine; Segeral, Emmanuel; Yatim, Ahmad; Emiliani, Stephane; Schwartz, Olivier; Benkirane, Monsef","Laguette, N; Sobhian, B; Casartelli, N; Ringeard, M; Chable-Bessia, C; Segeral, E; Yatim, A; Emiliani, S; Schwartz, O; Benkirane, M",654.0,"[Laguette, Nadine; Sobhian, Bijan; Ringeard, Mathieu; Chable-Bessia, Christine; Yatim, Ahmad; Benkirane, Monsef] CNRS, Inst Genet Humaine, Lab Virol Mol, UPR1142, F-34000 Montpellier, France; [Casartelli, Nicoletta; Schwartz, Olivier] CNRS, Inst Pasteur, Virus & Immun Unit, URA 3015, Paris, France; [Segeral, Emmanuel; Emiliani, Stephane] Univ Paris 05, CNRS, Inst Cochin, UMR 8104,INSERM,U567, Paris, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10117,Article,1476-4687,nadine.laguette@igh.cnrs.fr; monsef.benkirane@igh.cnrs.fr,U132,ERC [250333]; Sidaction; ANRS; FRM 'equipe labellisee'; CNRS/region Languedoc Roussillon; European FP7 [201412]; Institut Pasteur,"We wish to thank members of the Molecular Virology laboratory for critical reading of the manuscript, N.

112,125,130.0,"In BRAF(V600)-mutant tumours, most mechanisms of resistance to drugs that target the BRAF and/or MEK kinases rely on reactivation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction pathway, on activation of the alternative, PI(3) K-AKT-mTOR, pathway (which is ERK independent) or on modulation of the caspase-dependent apoptotic cascade(1-3). All three pathways converge to regulate the formation of the eIF4F eukaryotic translation initiation complex, which binds to the 7-methylguanylate cap (m(7)G) at the 59 end of messenger RNA, thereby modulating the translation of specific mRNAs(4,5). Here we show that the persistent formation of the eIF4F complex, comprising the eIF4E cap-binding protein, the eIF4G scaffolding protein and the eIF4A RNA helicase, is associated with resistance to anti-BRAF, anti-MEK and anti-BRAF plus anti-MEK drug combinations in BRAF(V600)-mutant melanoma, colon and thyroid cancer cell lines. Resistance to treatment and maintenance of eIF4F complex formation is associated with one of three mechanisms: reactivation of MAPK signalling, persistent ERK-independent phosphorylation of the inhibitory eIF4E-binding protein 4EBP1 or increased pro-apoptotic BCL-2-modifying factor (BMF)-dependent degradation of eIF4G. The development of an in situ method to detect the eIF4E-eIF4G interactions shows that eIF4F complex formation is decreased in tumours that respond to anti-BRAF therapy and increased in resistant metastases compared to tumours before treatment. Strikingly, inhibiting the eIF4F complex, either by blocking the eIF4E-eIF4G interaction or by targeting eIF4A, synergizes with inhibiting BRAF(V600) to kill the cancer cells. eIF4F not only appears to be an indicator of both innate and acquired resistance but also is a promising therapeutic target. Combinations of drugs targeting BRAF(and/or MEK) and eIF4F may overcome most of the resistance mechanisms arising in BRAF(V600)-mutant cancers.","Boussemart, Lise; Malka-Mahieu, Helene; Girault, Isabelle; Allard, Delphine; Hemmingsson, Oskar; Tomasic, Gorana; Thomas, Marina; Basmadjian, Christine; Ribeiro, Nigel; Thuaud, Frederic; Mateus, Christina; Routier, Emilie; Kamsu-Kom, Nyam; Agoussi, Sandrine; Eggermont, Alexander M.; Desaubry, Laurent; Robert, Caroline; Vagner, Stephan","Boussemart, L; Malka-Mahieu, H; Girault, I; Allard, D; Hemmingsson, O; Tomasic, G; Thomas, M; Basmadjian, C; Ribeiro, N; Thuaud, F; Mateus, C; Routier, E; Kamsu-Kom, N; Agoussi, S; Eggermont, AM; Desaubry, L; Robert, C; Vagner, S",105.0,"[Boussemart, Lise; Malka-Mahieu, Helene; Girault, Isabelle; Allard, Delphine; Hemmingsson, Oskar; Kamsu-Kom, Nyam; Agoussi, Sandrine; Robert, Caroline; Vagner, Stephan] Inserm UMR981, F-94805 Villejuif, France; [Boussemart, Lise; Malka-Mahieu, Helene; Eggermont, Alexander M.; Robert, Caroline; Vagner, Stephan] Univ Paris 11, F-94276 Le Kremlin Bicetre, France; [Boussemart, Lise; Thomas, Marina; Mateus, Christina; Routier, Emilie; Eggermont, Alexander M.; Robert, Caroline; Vagner, Stephan] Gustave Roussy, Dermatooncol, F-94805 Villejuif, France; [Tomasic, Gorana] Gustave Roussy, Dept Pathol, F-94805 Villejuif, France; [Basmadjian, Christine; Ribeiro, Nigel; Thuaud, Frederic; Desaubry, Laurent] Strasbourg Univ, CNRS, UMR7200, F-67400 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13572,Article,1476-4687,caroline.robert@gustaveroussy.fr; stephan.vagner@inserm.fr,+,Institut National du CAncer (INCA); Association pour la Recherche sur le Cancer (ARC); Ligue contre le Cancer via an Integrated Research Action Program Melanoma (PAIR Melanome); Canceropole Ile de France and Ensemble Contre le Melanome; ARC; AAREC Filia Research for fellowships; Wenner-Gren Foundation; Swedish Society of Medicine,"The authors thank J.

113,80,224.0,"Morphogens act in developing tissues to control the spatial arrangement of cellular differentiation(1,2). The activity of a morphogen has generally been viewed as a concentration-dependent response to a diffusible signal, but the duration of morphogen signalling can also affect cellular responses(3). One such example is the morphogen sonic hedgehog (SHH). In the vertebrate central nervous system and limbs, the pattern of cellular differentiation is controlled by both the amount and the time of SHH exposure(4-7). How these two parameters are interpreted at a cellular level has been unclear. Here we provide evidence that changing the concentration or duration of SHH has an equivalent effect on intracellular signalling. Chick neural cells convert different concentrations of SHH into time-limited periods of signal transduction, such that signal duration is proportional to SHH concentration. This depends on the gradual desensitization of cells to ongoing SHH exposure, mediated by the SHH-dependent upregulation of patched 1 (PTC1), a ligand-binding inhibitor of SHH signalling(8). Thus, in addition to its role in shaping the SHH gradient(8-10), PTC1 participates cell autonomously in gradient sensing. Together, the data reveal a novel strategy for morphogen interpretation, in which the temporal adaptation of cells to a morphogen integrates the concentration and duration of a signal to control differential gene expression.","Dessaud, Eric; Yang, Lin Lin; Hill, Katy; Cox, Barny; Ulloa, Fausto; Ribeiro, Ana; Mynett, Anita; Novitch, Bennett G.; Briscoe, James","Dessaud, E; Yang, LL; Hill, K; Cox, B; Ulloa, F; Ribeiro, A; Mynett, A; Novitch, BG; Briscoe, J",717.0,"Natl Inst Med Res, London NW7 1AA, England; Univ Michigan, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06347,Article,1476-4687,james.briscoe@nimr.mrc.ac.uk,U7,Medical Research Council [MC_U117560541]; NINDS NIH HHS [R01 NS072804],,235BY,,,PROGENITOR-CELL IDENTITY; VENTRAL NEURAL-TUBE; NEURONAL FATE; FLOOR PLATE; TRANSDUCTION; SPECIFICATION; INDUCTION; GENE; PATHWAY; PATTERN,7170.0,NATURE,Nature,English,33.0,No,"Novitch, Bennett/0000-0002-2696-3708; Dessaud, Eric/0000-0001-9723-6658; Briscoe, James/0000-0002-1020-5240","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",29-Nov,5.0,LONDON,18046410.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007.0,,"Briscoe, J (reprint author), Natl Inst Med Res, Mill Hill, London NW7 1AA, England.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,256.0,Interpretation of the sonic hedgehog morphogen gradient by a temporal adaptation mechanism,0.0,16.0,WOS:000251209700053,224.0,450,Multidisciplinary Sciences,258,james,briscoe,14198.0,6359,male,0.99,VJ83sekAAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",45465524,1,28802773,1,Jim Briscoe,Jim Briscoe,1,1

115,210,397.0,"Piwi proteins and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) have conserved functions in transposon silencing(1). The murine Piwi proteins Mili and Miwi2 (also called Piwil2 and Piwil4, respectively) direct epigenetic LINE1 and intracisternal A particle transposon silencing during genome reprogramming in the embryonic male germ line(2-4). Piwi proteins are proposed to be piRNA-guided endonucleases that initiate secondary piRNA biogenesis(5-7); however, the actual contribution of their endonuclease activities to piRNA biogenesis and transposon silencing remain unknown. To investigate the role of Piwi-catalysed endonucleolytic activity, we engineered point mutations in mice that substitute the second aspartic acid to an alanine in the DDH catalytic triad of Mili and Miwi2, generating the Mili(DAH) and Miwi2(DAH) alleles, respectively. Analysis of Mili-bound piRNAs from homozygous Mili(DAH) fetal gonadocytes revealed a failure of transposon piRNA amplification, resulting in the marked reduction of piRNA bound within Miwi2 ribonuclear particles. We find that Mili-mediated piRNA amplification is selectively required for LINE1, but not intracisternal A particle, silencing. The defective piRNA pathway in Mili(DAH) mice results in spermatogenic failure and sterility. Surprisingly, homozygous Miwi2(DAH) mice are fertile, transposon silencing is established normally and no defects in secondary piRNA biogenesis are observed. In addition, the hallmarks of piRNA amplification are observed in Miwi2-deficient gonadocytes. We conclude that cycles of intra-Mili secondary piRNA biogenesis fuel piRNA amplification that is absolutely required for LINE1 silencing.","De Fazio, Serena; Bartonicek, Nenad; Di Giacomo, Monica; Abreu-Goodger, Cei; Sankar, Aditya; Funaya, Charlotta; Antony, Claude; Moreira, Pedro N.; Enright, Anton J.; O'Carroll, Donal","De Fazio, S; Bartonicek, N; Di Giacomo, M; Abreu-Goodger, C; Sankar, A; Funaya, C; Antony, C; Moreira, PN; Enright, AJ; O'Carroll, D",259.0,"[De Fazio, Serena; Di Giacomo, Monica; Sankar, Aditya; Moreira, Pedro N.; O'Carroll, Donal] European Mol Biol Lab, Mouse Biol Unit, I-00015 Monterotondo, Italy; [Bartonicek, Nenad; Abreu-Goodger, Cei; Enright, Anton J.] European Mol Biol Lab, European Bioinformat Inst, Cambridge CB10 1SD, England; [Funaya, Charlotta; Antony, Claude] European Mol Biol Lab, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10547,Article,1476-4687,ocarroll@embl.it,U148,,,857TR,,,DNA METHYLATION; FAMILY-MEMBERS; PIWI PROTEINS; GERM-CELLS; MICE; PATHWAY; GENE; MIRNA; RISC; RNAS,7376.0,NATURE,Nature,English,40.0,No,"Abreu-Goodger, Cei/0000-0001-8302-9893; Enright, Anton/0000-0002-6090-3100; Bartonicek, Nenad/0000-0003-2144-1887; Sankar, Aditya/0000-0002-1840-3356; O'Carroll, Donal/0000-0002-8626-2217","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",8-Dec,7.0,LONDON,22020280.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2011.0,"Abreu-Goodger, Cei/A-1268-2010; Enright, Anton/F-3094-2011; Bartonicek, Nenad/B-6675-2016","O'Carroll, D (reprint author), European Mol Biol Lab, Mouse Biol Unit, Via Ramarini 32, I-00015 Monterotondo, Italy.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,114.0,The endonuclease activity of Mili fuels piRNA amplification that silences LINE1 elements,1.0,19.0,WOS:000297744200055,397.0,480,Multidisciplinary Sciences,117,donal,o'carroll,15090.0,11,male,1.0,KX0vLLQAAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",6319420,1,na,0,O'Carroll,na,1,0
116,124,126.0,"The role of mantle-lithosphere interactions in shaping surface topography has long been debated(1-3). In general(3,4), it is supposed that mantle plumes and vertical mantle flows result in axisymmetric, long-wavelength topography, which strongly differs from the generally asymmetric short-wavelength topography created by intraplate tectonic forces. However, identification of mantle-induced topography is difficult(3), especially in the continents(5). It can be argued therefore that complex brittle-ductile rheology and stratification of the continental lithosphere result in short-wavelength modulation and localization of deformation induced by mantle flow(6). This deformation should also be affected by far-field stresses and, hence, interplay with the 'tectonic' topography (for example, in the 'active/passive' rifting scenario(7,8)). Testing these ideas requires fully coupled three-dimensional numerical modelling of mantle-lithosphere interactions, which so far has not been possible owing to the conceptual and technical limitations of earlier approaches. Here we present new, ultra-high-resolution, three-dimensional numerical experiments on topography over mantle plumes, incorporating a weakly pre-stressed (ultra-slow spreading), rheologically realistic lithosphere. The results show complex surface evolution, which is very different from the smooth, radially symmetric patterns usually assumed as the canonical surface signature of mantle upwellings(9). In particular, the topography exhibits strongly asymmetric, small-scale, three-dimensional features, which include narrow and wide rifts, flexural flank uplifts and fault structures. This suggests a dominant role for continental rheological structure and intra-plate stresses in controlling dynamic topography, mantle-lithosphere interactions, and continental break-up processes above mantle plumes.","Burov, Evgueni; Gerya, Taras","Burov, E; Gerya, T",85.0,"[Burov, Evgueni] Univ Paris 06, Sorbonne Univ, UMR 7193, Inst Sci Terre Paris ISTeP, F-75005 Paris, France; [Burov, Evgueni] CNRS, UMR 7193, Inst Sci Terre Paris ISTeP, F-75005 Paris, France; [Gerya, Taras] ETH, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13703,Article,1476-4687,evgenii.burov@upmc.fr,+,Advanced ERC grant RHEOLITH; INSU-CNRS; UPMC Invited Professor grant; ETH Invited Professor grant,"B.

117,75,497.0,"Ovarian carcinomas with mutations in the tumour suppressor BRCA2 are particularly sensitive to platinum compounds(1). However, such carcinomas ultimately develop cisplatin resistance. The mechanism of that resistance is largely unknown(2). Here we show that acquired resistance to cisplatin can be mediated by secondary intragenic mutations in BRCA2 that restore the wildtype BRCA2 reading frame. First, in a cisplatin- resistant BRCA2-mutated breast- cancer cell line, HCC1428, a secondary genetic change in BRCA2 rescued BRCA2 function. Second, cisplatin selection of a BRCA2- mutated pancreatic cancer cell line, Capan- 1 ( refs 3, 4), led to five different secondary mutations that restored the wild- type BRCA2 reading frame. All clones with secondary mutations were resistant both to cisplatin and to a poly( ADP- ribose) polymerase ( PARP) inhibitor ( AG14361). Finally, we evaluated recurrent cancers from patients whose primary BRCA2- mutated ovarian carcinomas were treated with cisplatin. The recurrent tumour that acquired cisplatin resistance had undergone reversion of its BRCA2 mutation. Our results suggest that secondary mutations that restore the wild- type BRCA2 reading frame may be a major clinical mediator of acquired resistance to platinum- based chemotherapy.","Sakai, Wataru; Swisher, Elizabeth M.; Karlan, Beth Y.; Agarwal, Mukesh K.; Higgins, Jake; Friedman, Cynthia; Villegas, Emily; Jacquemont, Celine; Farrugia, Daniel J.; Couch, Fergus J.; Urban, Nicole; Taniguchi, Toshiyasu","Sakai, W; Swisher, EM; Karlan, BY; Agarwal, MK; Higgins, J; Friedman, C; Villegas, E; Jacquemont, C; Farrugia, DJ; Couch, FJ; Urban, N; Taniguchi, T",1116.0,"[Sakai, Wataru; Friedman, Cynthia; Villegas, Emily; Jacquemont, Celine; Taniguchi, Toshiyasu] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Div Human Biol, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Sakai, Wataru; Villegas, Emily; Jacquemont, Celine; Urban, Nicole; Taniguchi, Toshiyasu] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Div Publ Hlth Sci, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Swisher, Elizabeth M.] Univ Washington, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Swisher, Elizabeth M.; Higgins, Jake] Univ Washington, Dept Med, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Karlan, Beth Y.] Cedars Sinai Med Ctr, Womens Canc Res Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90048 USA; [Agarwal, Mukesh K.; Farrugia, Daniel J.; Couch, Fergus J.] Mayo Clin, Dept Lab Med & Pathol, Rochester, MN 55905 USA; [Higgins, Jake] Univ Washington, Dept Genome Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06633,Article,,ttaniguc@fhcrc.org,U9,"NCI NIH HHS [K08 CA096610, K08 CA096610-01, P50 CA083636, P50 CA083636-10, R01 CA125636, R01 CA125636-02]",,266RB,Y,N,HOMOLOGY-DIRECTED REPAIR; BRCA MUTANT-CELLS; FANCONI-ANEMIA; OVARIAN-CANCER; BREAST-CANCER; IN-VIVO; PATHWAY; GENE; INHIBITORS; DEFECT,7182.0,NATURE,Nature,English,39.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",28-Feb,6.0,LONDON,18264087.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,"Sakai, Wataru/J-6917-2012; Farrugia, Daniel/E-4752-2015","Taniguchi, T (reprint author), Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Div Human Biol, Seattle, WA 98109 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,452.0,Secondary mutations as a mechanism of cisplatin resistance in BRCA2-mutated cancers,3.0,38.0,WOS:000253453600044,497.0,451,Multidisciplinary Sciences,463,toshiyasu,taniguchi,9914.0,1,male,1.0,ymqMBjwAAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",12714240,1,na,0,Wild Guns,na,0,0
118,173,213.0,"Fermi liquid theory provides a remarkably powerful framework for the description of the conduction electrons in metals and their ordering phenomena, such as superconductivity, ferromagnetism, and spin-and charge-density-wave order. A different class of ordering phenomena of great interest concerns spin configurations that are topologically protected, that is, their topology can be destroyed only by forcing the average magnetization locally to zero(1). Examples of such configurations are hedgehogs (points at which all spins are either pointing inwards or outwards) and vortices. A central question concerns the nature of the metallic state in the presence of such topologically distinct spin textures. Here we report a high-pressure study of the metallic state at the border of the skyrmion lattice in MnSi, which represents a new form of magnetic order composed of topologically non-trivial vortices(2). When long-range magnetic order is suppressed under pressure, the key characteristic of the skyrmion lattice-that is, the topological Hall signal due to the emergent magnetic flux associated with the topological winding-is unaffected in sign or magnitude and becomes an important characteristic of the metallic state. The regime of the topological Hall signal in temperature, pressure and magnetic field coincides thereby with the exceptionally extended regime of a pronounced non-Fermi-liquid resistivity(3,30). The observation of this topological Hall signal in the regime of the NFL resistivity suggests empirically that spin correlations with non-trivial topological character may drive a breakdown of Fermi liquid theory in pure metals.","Ritz, R.; Halder, M.; Wagner, M.; Franz, C.; Bauer, A.; Pfleiderer, C.","Ritz, R; Halder, M; Wagner, M; Franz, C; Bauer, A; Pfleiderer, C",231.0,"[Ritz, R.; Halder, M.; Wagner, M.; Franz, C.; Bauer, A.; Pfleiderer, C.] Tech Univ Munich, Phys Dept E21, D-85748 Garching, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12023,Article,1476-4687,robert.ritz@frm2.tum.de; christian.pfleiderer@frm2.tum.de,234,"TUM Graduate School; DFG [TRR80, FOR960]; ERC-AdG [291079 TOPFIT]","We wish to thank P.

119,101,201.0,"Fuel cells, as devices for direct conversion of the chemical energy of a fuel into electricity by electrochemical reactions, are among the key enabling technologies for the transition to a hydrogen-based economy(1-3). Of several different types of fuel cells under development today, polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) have been recognized as a potential future power source for zero-emission vehicles(4,5). However, to become commercially viable, PEFCs have to overcome the barrier of high catalyst cost caused by the exclusive use of platinum and platinum-based catalysts(6-8) in the fuel-cell electrodes. Here we demonstrate a new class of low-cost (non-precious metal)/(heteroatomic polymer) nanocomposite catalysts for the PEFC cathode, capable of combining high oxygen-reduction activity with good performance durability. Without any optimization, the cobalt-polypyrrole composite catalyst enables power densities of about 0.15 W cm(-2) in H-2-O-2 fuel cells and displays no signs of performance degradation for more than 100 hours. The results of this study show that heteroatomic polymers can be used not only to stabilize the non-precious metal in the acidic environment of the PEFC cathode but also to generate active sites for oxygen reduction reaction.","Bashyam, Rajesh; Zelenay, Piotr","Bashyam, R; Zelenay, P",63.0,"Los Alamos Natl Lab, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature05118,Article,,zelenay@lanl.gov,66,,,081JM,,,FE-BASED CATALYSTS; OXYGEN REDUCTION; PLATINUM MONOLAYER; O-2 REDUCTION; CARBON-BLACK; ELECTROCATALYSTS; CATHODE; POLYPYRROLE; PROTON; ENERGY,7107.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,"Thandavarayan, Maiyalagan/0000-0003-3528-3824","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",7-Sep,4.0,LONDON,16957726.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,"Thandavarayan, Maiyalagan/C-5716-2011","Zelenay, P (reprint author), Los Alamos Natl Lab, POB 1663, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,1278.0,A class of non-precious metal composite catalysts for fuel cells,82.0,891.0,WOS:000240313900039,201.0,443,Multidisciplinary Sciences,1304,piotr,zelenay,14379.0,176,male,1.0,jxaMcQoAAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
120,143,112.0,"The protozoan parasites Trypanosoma brucei spp. cause important human and livestock diseases in sub-Saharan Africa. In mammalian blood, two developmental forms of the parasite exist: proliferative 'slender' forms and arrested 'stumpy' forms that are responsible for transmission to tsetse flies. The slender to stumpy differentiation is a density-dependent response that resembles quorum sensing in microbial systems and is crucial for the parasite life cycle, ensuring both infection chronicity and disease transmission(1). This response is triggered by an elusive 'stumpy induction factor' (SIF) whose intracellular signalling pathway is also uncharacterized. Laboratory-adapted (monomorphic) trypanosome strains respond inefficiently to SIF but can generate forms with stumpy characteristics when exposed to cell-permeable cAMP and AMP analogues. Exploiting this, we have used a genome-wide RNA interference library screen to identify the signalling components driving stumpy formation. In separate screens, monomorphic parasites were exposed to 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP(pCPT-cAMP) or 8-pCPT-2'-O-methyl-5'-AMP to select cells that were unresponsive to these signals and hence remained proliferative. Genome-wide Ion Torrent based RNAi target sequencing identified cohorts of genes implicated in each step of the signalling pathway, from purine metabolism, through signal transducers (kinases, phosphatases) to gene expression regulators. Genes at each step were independently validated in cells naturally capable of stumpy formation, confirming their role in density sensing in vivo. The putative RNA-binding protein, RBP7, was required for normal quorum sensing and promoted cell-cycle arrest and transmission competence when overexpressed. This study reveals that quorum sensing signalling in trypanosomes shares similarities to fundamental quiescence pathways in eukaryotic cells, its components providing targets for quorum-sensing interference-based therapeutics.","Mony, Binny M.; MacGregor, Paula; Ivens, Alasdair; Rojas, Federico; Cowton, Andrew; Young, Julie; Horn, David; Matthews, Keith","Mony, BM; MacGregor, P; Ivens, A; Rojas, F; Cowton, A; Young, J; Horn, D; Matthews, K",681.0,"[Mony, Binny M.; MacGregor, Paula; Ivens, Alasdair; Rojas, Federico; Cowton, Andrew; Young, Julie; Matthews, Keith] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Biol Sci, Inst Immunol & Infect Res, Ctr Immun Infect & Evolut, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland; [Horn, David] Univ Dundee, Coll Life Sci, Dundee DD1 5EH, Scotland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12864,Article,1476-4687,keith.matthews@ed.ac.uk,+,"Wellcome Trust [088293MA, 095831MA, 100320/Z/12/Z]","This work was funded by a Wellcome Trust Programme grant (088293MA) to K.M. and by a Wellcome Trust strategic award (095831MA) to the Centre for Immunity, Infection and Evolution.

121,49,419.0,"A long-standing issue in ecology is reconciling the apparent stability of many populations with robust predictions of large-amplitude population cycles from general theory on consumer resource interactions(1). Even when consumers are decoupled from dynamic resources, large- amplitude cycles can theoretically emerge from delayed feedback processes found in many consumers(2,3). Here we show that resource- dependent mortality and a dynamic developmental delay in consumers produces a new type of small- amplitude cycle that coexists with large- amplitude fluctuations in coupled consumer - resource systems. A distinctive characteristic of the small- amplitude cycles is slow juvenile development for consumers, leading to a developmental delay that is longer than the cycle period. By contrast, the period exceeds the delay in large-amplitude cycles. These theoretical predictions may explain previous empirical results on coexisting attractors found in Daphnia algal systems(4,5). To test this, we used bioassay experiments that measure the growth rates of individuals in populations exhibiting each type of cycle. The results were consistent with predictions. Together, the new theory and experiments establish that two very general features of consumers - a resource- dependent juvenile stage duration and resource- dependent mortality - combine to produce small- amplitude resource - consumer cycles. This phenomenon may contribute to the prevalence of small- amplitude fluctuations in many other consumer - resource populations(6,7).","McCauley, Edward; Nelson, William A.; Nisbet, Roger M.","McCauley, E; Nelson, WA; Nisbet, RM",1240.0,"[McCauley, Edward] Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, Ecol & Evolut Grp, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [Nelson, William A.] Queens Univ, Dept Biol, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada; [Nisbet, Roger M.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07220,Article,,mccauley@ucalgary.ca,1243,NSERC ( Discovery Grants and Accelerator Award); Canada Foundation for Innovation; Canada Research Chairs Program; Alberta Ingenuity; US National Science Foundation [DEB- 0717259],"We acknowledge feedback from A. de Roos, J.

122,40,156.0,"Interactions lie at the heart of correlated many-body quantum phases(1-3). Typically, the interactions between microscopic particles are described as two-body interactions. However, it has been shown that higher-order multi-body interactions could give rise to novel quantum phases with intriguing properties. So far, multi-body interactions have been observed as inelastic loss resonances in three-and four-body recombinations of atom-atom and atom-molecule collisions(4-6). Here we demonstrate the presence of effective multi-body interactions(7) in a system of ultracold bosonic atoms in a three-dimensional optical lattice, emerging through virtual transitions of particles from the lowest energy band to higher energy bands. We observe such interactions up to the six-body case in time-resolved traces of quantum phase revivals(8-11), using an atom interferometric technique that allows us to precisely measure the absolute energies of atom number states at a lattice site. In addition, we show that the spectral content of these time traces can reveal the atom number statistics at a lattice site, similar to foundational experiments in cavity quantum electrodynamics that yield the statistics of a cavity photon field(12). Our precision measurement of multi-body interaction energies provides crucial input for the comparison of optical-lattice quantum simulators with many-body quantum theory.","Will, Sebastian; Best, Thorsten; Schneider, Ulrich; Hackermueller, Lucia; Luehmann, Dirk-Soeren; Bloch, Immanuel","Will, S; Best, T; Schneider, U; Hackermuller, L; Luhmann, DS; Bloch, I",197.0,"[Will, Sebastian; Best, Thorsten; Schneider, Ulrich; Hackermueller, Lucia; Bloch, Immanuel] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Phys, D-55099 Mainz, Germany; [Will, Sebastian; Schneider, Ulrich; Bloch, Immanuel] Univ Munich, Fac Phys, D-80799 Munich, Germany; [Luehmann, Dirk-Soeren] Univ Hamburg, Inst Theoret Phys, D-20355 Hamburg, Germany; [Bloch, Immanuel] Max Planck Inst Quantum Opt, D-85748 Garching, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09036,Article,,sebastian.will@lmu.de,201,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; European Union, EuroQUAM; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency; US Air Force Office of Scientific Research, MATCOR; Gutenberg Akademie","This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, the European Union (Integrated Project SCALA), EuroQUAM (L.

123,28,462.0,"The superposition of quantum states drives motion on the atomic and subatomic scales, with the energy spacing of the states dictating the speed of the motion. In the case of electrons residing in the outer (valence) shells of atoms and molecules which are separated by electronvolt energies, this means that valence electron motion occurs on a subfemtosecond to few-femtosecond timescale (1 fs = 10(-15) s). In the absence of complete measurements, the motion can be characterized in terms of a complex quantity, the density matrix. Here we report an attosecond pump-probe measurement of the density matrix of valence electrons in atomic krypton ions(1). We generate the ions with a controlled few-cycle laser field(2) and then probe them through the spectrally resolved absorption of an attosecond extreme-ultraviolet pulse(3), which allows us to observe in real time the subfemtosecond motion of valence electrons over a multifemtosecond time span. We are able to completely characterize the quantum mechanical electron motion and determine its degree of coherence in the specimen of the ensemble. Although the present study uses a simple, prototypical open system, attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy should be applicable to molecules and solid-state materials to reveal the elementary electron motions that control physical, chemical and biological properties and processes.","Goulielmakis, Eleftherios; Loh, Zhi-Heng; Wirth, Adrian; Santra, Robin; Rohringer, Nina; Yakovlev, Vladislav S.; Zherebtsov, Sergey; Pfeifer, Thomas; Azzeer, Abdallah M.; Kling, Matthias F.; Leone, Stephen R.; Krausz, Ferenc","Goulielmakis, E; Loh, ZH; Wirth, A; Santra, R; Rohringer, N; Yakovlev, VS; Zherebtsov, S; Pfeifer, T; Azzeer, AM; Kling, MF; Leone, SR; Krausz, F",739.0,"[Goulielmakis, Eleftherios; Wirth, Adrian; Yakovlev, Vladislav S.; Zherebtsov, Sergey; Kling, Matthias F.; Krausz, Ferenc] Max Planck Inst Quantum Opt, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Loh, Zhi-Heng; Pfeifer, Thomas; Leone, Stephen R.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Loh, Zhi-Heng; Pfeifer, Thomas; Leone, Stephen R.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Loh, Zhi-Heng; Pfeifer, Thomas; Leone, Stephen R.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Div Chem Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Santra, Robin] Argonne Natl Lab, Argonne, IL 60439 USA; [Santra, Robin] Univ Chicago, Dept Phys, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Rohringer, Nina] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Livermore, CA 94551 USA; [Yakovlev, Vladislav S.; Krausz, Ferenc] Univ Munich, Dept Phys, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Azzeer, Abdallah M.] King Saud Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09212,Article,,elgo@mpq.mpg.de; srl@berkeley.edu; krausz@lmu.de,U7,"Max Planck Society; King Saud University; DFG Cluster of Excellence: Munich Centre for Advanced Photonics; Marie-Curie Reintegration grant [MERG-CT-2007-208643]; DFG; Air Force Office of Scientific Research [FA9550-04-1-0242]; National Science Foundation [CHE-0742662, EEC-0310717]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, DE-AC02-06CH11357]; MPG; US Department of Energy, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory [DE-AC52-07NA27344]","We thank U.

124,238,90.0,"The ubiquitination of cell cycle regulatory proteins by the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome(APC/C) controls sister chromatid segregation, cytokinesis and the establishment of the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The APC/C is an unusually large multimeric cullin-RING ligase. Its activity is strictly dependent on regulatory coactivator subunits that promote APC/C-substrate interactions and stimulate its catalytic reaction. Because the structures of many APC/C subunits and their organization within the assembly are unknown, the molecular basis for these processes is poorly understood. Here, from a cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction of a human APC/C-coactivator-substrate complex at 7.4 angstrom resolution, we have determined the complete secondary structural architecture of the complex. With this information we identified protein folds for structurally uncharacterized subunits, and the definitive location of all 20 APC/C subunits within the 1.2 MDa assembly. Comparison with apo APC/C shows that the coactivator promotes a profound allosteric transition involving displacement of the cullin-RING catalytic subunits relative to the degron-recognition module of coactivator and APC10. This transition is accompanied by increased flexibility of the cullin-RING subunits and enhanced affinity for UBCH10-ubiquitin, changes which may contribute to coactivator-mediated stimulation of APC/C E3 ligase activity.","Chang, Leifu; Zhang, Ziguo; Yang, Jing; McLaughlin, Stephen H.; Barford, David","Chang, LF; Zhang, ZG; Yang, J; McLaughlin, SH; Barford, D",388.0,"[Chang, Leifu; Zhang, Ziguo; Yang, Jing; Barford, David] Inst Canc Res, Div Struct Biol, London SW3 6JB, England; [Chang, Leifu; Zhang, Ziguo; Yang, Jing; McLaughlin, Stephen H.; Barford, David] MRC Lab Mol Biol, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13543,Article,1476-4687,dbarford@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk,+,Cancer Research UK,We thank P. da Fonseca for her guidance preparing cryo electron microscopy grids and X.

125,177,274.0,"The energy-based refinement of low-resolution protein structure models to atomic-level accuracy is a major challenge for computational structural biology. Here we describe a new approach to refining protein structure models that focuses sampling in regions most likely to contain errors while allowing the whole structure to relax in a physically realistic all-atom force field. In applications to models produced using nuclear magnetic resonance data and to comparative models based on distant structural homologues, the method can significantly improve the accuracy of the structures in terms of both the backbone conformations and the placement of core side chains. Furthermore, the resulting models satisfy a particularly stringent test: they provide significantly better solutions to the X-ray crystallographic phase problem in molecular replacement trials. Finally, we show that all-atom refinement can produce de novo protein structure predictions that reach the high accuracy required for molecular replacement without any experimental phase information and in the absence of templates suitable for molecular replacement from the Protein Data Bank. These results suggest that the combination of high-resolution structure prediction with state-of-the-art phasing tools may be unexpectedly powerful in phasing crystallographic data for which molecular replacement is hindered by the absence of sufficiently accurate previous models.","Qian, Bin; Raman, Srivatsan; Das, Rhiju; Bradley, Philip; McCoy, Airlie J.; Read, Randy J.; Baker, David","Qian, B; Raman, S; Das, R; Bradley, P; McCoy, AJ; Read, RJ; Baker, D",259.0,"Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Inst Med Res, Dept Haematol, Cambridge CB2 0XY, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06249,Article,1476-4687,dabaker@u.washington.edu,264,"Wellcome Trust [, 050211]",,228RC,,,PROTEIN-STRUCTURE PREDICTION; STRUCTURE REFINEMENT; MOLECULAR-REPLACEMENT; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; STRUCTURE MODELS; NMR STRUCTURES; X-RAY; ALIGNMENT; IDENTIFICATION; INFORMATION,7167.0,NATURE,Nature,English,50.0,No,"Read, Randy/0000-0001-8273-0047; Baker, David/0000-0001-7896-6217; Das, Rhiju/0000-0001-7497-0972","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",8-Nov,6.0,LONDON,17934447.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007.0,"Read, Randy/L-1418-2013; Baker, David/K-8941-2012","Baker, D (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,196.0,High-resolution structure prediction and the crystallographic phase problem,4.0,34.0,WOS:000250746200052,274.0,450,Multidisciplinary Sciences,202,david,baker,66604.0,12593,male,1.0,UKqIqRsAAAAJ,5,"(17929, ]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
126,307,200.0,"Marine fishes and invertebrates respond to ocean warming through distribution shifts, generally to higher latitudes and deeper waters. Consequently, fisheries should be affected by 'tropicalization' of catch(1-4) (increasing dominance of warm-water species). However, a signature of such climate-change effects on global fisheries catch has so far not been detected. Here we report such an index, the mean temperature of the catch (MTC), that is calculated from the average inferred temperature preference of exploited species weighted by their annual catch. Our results show that, after accounting for the effects of fishing and large-scale oceanographic variability, global MTC increased at a rate of 0.19 degrees Celsius per decade between 1970 and 2006, and non-tropical MTC increased at a rate of 0.23 degrees Celsius per decade. In tropical areas, MTC increased initially because of the reduction in the proportion of subtropical species catches, but subsequently stabilized as scope for further tropicalization of communities became limited. Changes in MTC in 52 large marine ecosystems, covering the majority of the world's coastal and shelf areas, are significantly and positively related to regional changes in sea surface temperature(5). This study shows that ocean warming has already affected global fisheries in the past four decades, highlighting the immediate need to develop adaptation plans to minimize the effect of such warming on the economy and food security of coastal communities, particularly in tropical regions(6,7).","Cheung, William W.

To carry out analysis on gut microbial content in patients with type 2 diabetes, we developed a protocol for a metagenome-wide association study (MGWAS) and undertook a two-stage MGWAS based on deep shotgun sequencing of the gut microbial DNA from 345 Chinese individuals. We identified and validated approximately 60,000 type-2-diabetes-associated markers and established the concept of a metagenomic linkage group, enabling taxonomic species-level analyses. MGWAS analysis showed that patients with type 2 diabetes were characterized by a moderate degree of gut microbial dysbiosis, a decrease in the abundance of some universal butyrate-producing bacteria and an increase in various opportunistic pathogens, as well as an enrichment of other microbial functions conferring sulphate reduction and oxidative stress resistance.

128,249,245.0,"Disease tolerance is the ability of the host to reduce the effect of infection on host fitness. Analysis of disease tolerance pathways could provide new approaches for treating infections and other inflammatory diseases. Typically, an initial exposure to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces a state of refractoriness to further LPS challenge (endotoxin tolerance). We found that a first exposure of mice to LPS activated the ligand-operated transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and the hepatic enzyme tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase, which provided an activating ligand to the former, to down-regulate early inflammatory gene expression. However, on LPS rechallenge, AhR engaged in long-term regulation of systemic inflammation only in the presence of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1). AhR-complex-associated Src kinase activity promoted IDO1 phosphorylation and signalling ability. There sulting endotoxin-tolerant state was found to protect mice against immunopathology in Gram-negative and Gram-positive infections, pointing to a role for AhRin contributing to host fitness.","Bessede, Alban; Gargaro, Marco; Pallotta, Maria T.; Matino, Davide; Servillo, Giuseppe; Brunacci, Cinzia; Bicciato, Silvio; Mazza, Emilia M.

129,346,148.0,"The ability to control and tune interactions in ultracold atomic gases has paved the way for the realization of new phases of matter. So far, experiments have achieved a high degree of control over short-range interactions, but the realization of long-range interactions has become a central focus of research because it would open up a new realm of many-body physics. Rydberg atoms are highly suited to this goal because the van der Waals forces between them are many orders of magnitude larger than those between ground-state atoms(1). Consequently, mere laser excitation of ultracold gases can cause strongly correlated many-body states to emerge directly when atoms are transferred to Rydberg states. A key example is a quantum crystal composed of coherent superpositions of different, spatially ordered configurations of collective excitations(2-5). Here we use high-resolution, in situ Rydberg atom imaging to measure directly strong correlations in a laser-excited, two-dimensional atomic Mott insulator(6). The observations reveal the emergence of spatially ordered excitation patterns with random orientation, but well-defined geometry, in the high-density components of the prepared many-body state. Together with a time-resolved analysis, this supports the description of the system in terms of a correlated quantum state of collective excitations delocalized throughout the gas. Our experiment demonstrates the potential of Rydberg gases to realize exotic phases of matter, thereby laying the basis for quantum simulations of quantum magnets with long-range interactions.","Schauss, Peter; Cheneau, Marc; Endres, Manuel; Fukuhara, Takeshi; Hild, Sebastian; Omran, Ahmed; Pohl, Thomas; Gross, Christian; Kuhr, Stefan; Bloch, Immanuel","Schauss, P; Cheneau, M; Endres, M; Fukuhara, T; Hild, S; Omran, A; Pohl, T; Gross, C; Kuhr, S; Bloch, I",87.0,"[Schauss, Peter; Cheneau, Marc; Endres, Manuel; Fukuhara, Takeshi; Hild, Sebastian; Omran, Ahmed; Gross, Christian; Kuhr, Stefan; Bloch, Immanuel] Max Planck Inst Quantum Opt, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Pohl, Thomas] Max Planck Inst Phys Komplexer Syst, D-01187 Dresden, Germany; [Kuhr, Stefan] Univ Strathclyde, Dept Phys, SUPA, Glasgow G4 0NG, Lanark, Scotland; [Bloch, Immanuel] Univ Munich, Fak Phys, D-80799 Munich, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11596,Article,,peter.schauss@mpq.mpg.de,91,MPG; DFG; EU; JSPS,"We thank R.

130,162,160.0,"Recent advances in measuring gene expression at the single- cell level have highlighted the stochastic nature of messenger RNA and protein synthesis(1-3). Stochastic gene expression creates a source of variability in the abundance of cellular components, even among isogenic cells exposed to an identical environment. Recent integrated experimental and modelling studies(4-13) have shed light on the molecular sources of this variability. However, many of these studies focus on systems that have reached a steady state and therefore do not address a large class of dynamic phenomena including oscillatory gene expression. Here we develop a general protocol for analysing and predicting stochastic gene expression in systems that never reach steady states. We use this framework to analyse experimentally stochastic expression of genes driven by the Synechococcus elongatus circadian clock. We find that, although the average expression at two points in the circadian cycle separated by 12 hours is identical, the variability at these two time points can be different. We show that this is a general feature of out- of- steady- state systems. We demonstrate how intrinsic noise sources, owing to random births and deaths of mRNAs and proteins, or extrinsic noise sources, which introduce fluctuations in rate constants, affect the cell- to- cell variability. To distinguish experimentally between these sources, we measured how the correlation between expression fluctuations of two identical genes is modulated during the circadian cycle. This quantitative framework is generally applicable to any out- of steady state system and will be necessary for understanding the fidelity of dynamic cellular systems.","Chabot, Jeffrey R.; Pedraza, Juan M.; Luitel, Prashant; van Oudenaarden, Alexander","Chabot, JR; Pedraza, JM; Luitel, P; van Oudenaarden, A",1249.0,"MIT, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; MIT, George R Harrison Spect Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06395,Article,,avano@mit.edu,1252,,,243HA,,,SINGLE-CELL; PROTEIN EXPRESSION; NOISE; RHYTHMS; VARIABILITY; NETWORKS; LUCIFERASE; REPORTER; ORIGINS; LEVEL,7173.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",20-Dec,4.0,LONDON,18097413.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007.0,,"van Oudenaarden, A (reprint author), MIT, Dept Phys, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,71.0,Stochastic gene expression out-of-steady-state in the cyanobacterial circadian clock,1.0,9.0,WOS:000251786200054,160.0,450,Multidisciplinary Sciences,72,alexander,van oudenaarden,26343.0,1645,male,1.0,pxkP0GQAAAAJ,5,"(17929, ]",17509366,1,17509366,1,Alexander van Oudenaarden,Alexander van Oudenaarden,1,1

The assembled contigs (2.25 gigabases (Gb)) cover approximately 94% of the whole genome, and the remaining gaps (0.05 Gb) seem to contain carnivore-specific repeats and tandem repeats. Comparisons with the dog and human showed that the panda genome has a lower divergence rate. The assessment of panda genes potentially underlying some of its unique traits indicated that its bamboo diet might be more dependent on its gut microbiome than its own genetic composition. We also identified more than 2.7 million heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms in the diploid genome.

Ire1 excises an intron from HAC1 messenger RNA in yeasts and Xbp1 messenger RNA in metozoans encoding homologous transcription factors. This non- conventional mRNA splicing event initiates the unfolded protein response, a transcriptional program that relieves the endoplasmic reticulum stress. Here we show that oligomerization is central to Ire1 function and is an intrinsic attribute of its cytosolic domains. We obtained the 3.2- A crystal structure of the oligomer of the Ire1 cytosolic domains in complex with a kinase inhibitor that acts as a potent activator of the Ire1 RNase. The structure reveals a rod- shaped assembly that has no known precedence among kinases. This assembly positions the kinase domain for trans- autophosphorylation, orders the RNase domain, and creates an interaction surface for binding of the mRNA substrate. Activation of Ire1 through oligomerization expands the mechanistic repertoire of kinase- based signalling receptors.","Korennykh, Alexei V.; Egea, Pascal F.; Korostelev, Andrei A.; Finer-Moore, Janet; Zhang, Chao; Shokat, Kevan M.; Stroud, Robert M.; Walter, Peter","Korennykh, AV; Egea, PF; Korostelev, AA; Finer-Moore, J; Zhang, C; Shokat, KM; Stroud, RM; Walter, P",687.0,"[Korennykh, Alexei V.; Egea, Pascal F.; Finer-Moore, Janet; Stroud, Robert M.; Walter, Peter] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem & Biophys, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Zhang, Chao; Shokat, Kevan M.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Cellular & Mol Pharmacol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Korennykh, Alexei V.; Zhang, Chao; Shokat, Kevan M.; Walter, Peter] Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Korostelev, Andrei A.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Mol Cell & Dev Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07661,Article,,alexei.korennykh@ucsf.edu,U2,Jane Coffin Childs; National Parkinson Foundation; NIH [RO1 GM60641],"We thank A.

133,207,47.0,"In recent years, several associations between common chronic human disorders and altered gut microbiome composition and function have been reported(1,2). In most of these reports, treatment regimens were not controlled for and conclusions could thus be confounded by the effects of various drugs on the microbiota, which may obscure microbial causes, protective factors or diagnostically relevant signals. Our study addresses disease and drug signatures in the human gut microbiome of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Two previous quantitative gut metagenomics studies of T2D patients that were unstratified for treatment yielded divergent conclusions regarding its associated gut microbial dysbiosis(3,4). Here we show, using 784 available human gut metagenomes, how antidiabetic medication confounds these results, and analyse in detail the effects of the most widely used antidiabetic drug metformin. We provide support for microbial mediation of the therapeutic effects of metformin through short-chain fatty acid production, as well as for potential microbiota-mediated mechanisms behind known intestinal adverse effects in the form of a relative increase in abundance of Escherichia species. Controlling for metformin treatment, we report a unified signature of gut microbiome shifts in T2D with a depletion of butyrate-producing taxa(3,4). These in turn cause functional microbiome shifts, in part alleviated by metformin-induced changes. Overall, the present study emphasizes the need to disentangle gut microbiota signatures of specific human diseases from those of medication.","Forslund, Kristoffer; Hildebrand, Falk; Nielsen, Trine; Falony, Gwen; Le Chatelier, Emmanuelle; Sunagawa, Shinichi; Prifti, Edi; Vieira-Silva, Sara; Gudmundsdottir, Valborg; Pedersen, Helle Krogh; Arumugam, Manimozhiyan; Kristiansen, Karsten; Voigt, Anita Yvonne; Vestergaard, Henrik; Hercog, Rajna; Costea, Paul Igor; Kultima, Jens Roat; Li, Junhua; Jorgensen, Torben; Levenez, Florence; Dore, Joel; Nielsen, H.

134,416,219.0,"Spinal cord injuries often occur at the cervical level above the phrenic motor pools, which innervate the diaphragm. The effects of impaired breathing are a leading cause of death from spinal cord injuries, underscoring the importance of developing strategies to restore respiratory activity. Here we show that, after cervical spinal cord injury, the expression of chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans (CSPGs) associated with the perineuronal net (PNN) is upregulated around the phrenic motor neurons. Digestion of these potently inhibitory extracellular matrix molecules with chondroitinase ABC (denoted ChABC) could, by itself, promote the plasticity of tracts that were spared and restore limited activity to the paralysed diaphragm. However, when combined with a peripheral nerve autograft, ChABC treatment resulted in lengthy regeneration of serotonin-containing axons and other bulbospinal fibres and remarkable recovery of diaphragmatic function. After recovery and initial transection of the graft bridge, there was an unusual, overall increase in tonic electromyographic activity of the diaphragm, suggesting that considerable remodelling of the spinal cord circuitry occurs after regeneration. This increase was followed by complete elimination of the restored activity, proving that regeneration is crucial for the return of function. Overall, these experiments present a way to markedly restore the function of a single muscle after debilitating trauma to the central nervous system, through both promoting the plasticity of spared tracts and regenerating essential pathways.","Alilain, Warren J.; Horn, Kevin P.; Hu, Hongmei; Dick, Thomas E.; Silver, Jerry","Alilain, WJ; Horn, KP; Hu, HM; Dick, TE; Silver, J",196.0,"[Alilain, Warren J.; Horn, Kevin P.; Hu, Hongmei; Dick, Thomas E.; Silver, Jerry] Case Western Reserve Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Dick, Thomas E.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Sch Med, Div Pulm Crit Care & Sleep Med, Dept Med, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10199,Article,,wja4@case.edu; jxs10@case.edu,U95,"Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation; International Spinal Research Trust; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke [NS25713, NS060767]; National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute [HL080318]; Brumagin Memorial Fund; Ellen Becker Neuroscience Regenerative Medicine Research Fund","This project was funded by The Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation (W.J.A.), the International Spinal Research Trust (W.J.A.), the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, grants NS25713 and NS060767 (J.S.), and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, grant HL080318 (T.

Such early warning signals(10) may be due to the phenomenon of critical slowing down, which causes a system to recover slowly from small impacts, or to a flickering phenomenon, which causes a system to switch back and forth between alternative states in response to relatively large impacts. Such signals for transitions in social-ecological systems have rarely been observed(11), not the least because high-resolution time series are normally required. Here we combine empirical data from a lake-catchment system with a mathematical model and show that flickering can be detected from sparse data. We show how rising variance coupled to decreasing autocorrelation and skewness started 10-30 years before the transition to eutrophic lake conditions in both the empirical records and the model output, a finding that is consistent with flickering rather than critical slowing down(4,12). Our results suggest that if environmental regimes are sufficiently affected by large external impacts that flickering is induced, then early warning signals of transitions in modern social-ecological systems may be stronger, and hence easier to identify, than previously thought.","Wang, Rong; Dearing, John A.; Langdon, Peter G.; Zhang, Enlou; Yang, Xiangdong; Dakos, Vasilis; Scheffer, Marten","Wang, R; Dearing, JA; Langdon, PG; Zhang, EL; Yang, XD; Dakos, V; Scheffer, M",419.0,"[Wang, Rong; Dearing, John A.; Langdon, Peter G.] Univ Southampton, Palaeoecol Lab, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Wang, Rong; Zhang, Enlou; Yang, Xiangdong] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, State Key Lab Lake Sci & Environm, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Dakos, Vasilis; Scheffer, Marten] Wageningen Univ, Dept Aquat Ecol & Water Qual Management, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Dakos, Vasilis] CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Integrat Ecol Grp, E-41092 Seville, Spain",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11655,Article,,j.dearing@soton.ac.uk,422,UK Overseas Research Students Awards; Great Britain-China Educational Trust; University of Southampton; National Basic Research Program of China (973 program) [2012CB956104]; NWO-Rubicon; EU Marie Curie fellowship; Spinoza (NWO) Award; European Research Council,"A studentship to R.W. was funded through the UK Overseas Research Students Awards Scheme, the Great Britain-China Educational Trust and the University of Southampton.

136,32,14.0,"Nucleosomes compact and regulate access to DNA in the nucleus, and are composed of approximately 147 bases of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer(1,2). Here we report a genome-wide nucleosome positioning analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana using massively parallel sequencing of mononucleosomes. By combining this data with profiles of DNA methylation at single base resolution, we identified 10-base periodicities in the DNA methylation status of nucleosome-bound DNA and found that nucleosomal DNA was more highly methylated than flanking DNA. These results indicate that nucleosome positioning influences DNA methylation patterning throughout the genome and that DNA methyltransferases preferentially target nucleosome-bound DNA. We also observed similar trends in human nucleosomal DNA, indicating that the relationships between nucleosomes and DNA methyltransferases are conserved. Finally, as has been observed in animals, nucleosomes were highly enriched on exons, and preferentially positioned at intron-exon and exon-intron boundaries. RNA polymerase II (Pol II) was also enriched on exons relative to introns, consistent with the hypothesis that nucleosome positioning regulates Pol II processivity. DNA methylation is also enriched on exons, consistent with the targeting of DNA methylation to nucleosomes, and suggesting a role for DNA methylation in exon definition.","Chodavarapu, Ramakrishna K.; Feng, Suhua; Bernatavichute, Yana V.; Chen, Pao-Yang; Stroud, Hume; Yu, Yanchun; Hetzel, Jonathan A.; Kuo, Frank; Kim, Jin; Cokus, Shawn J.; Casero, David; Bernal, Maria; Huijser, Peter; Clark, Amander T.; Kraemer, Ute; Merchant, Sabeeha S.; Zhang, Xiaoyu; Jacobsen, Steven E.; Pellegrini, Matteo","Chodavarapu, RK; Feng, SH; Bernatavichute, YV; Chen, PY; Stroud, H; Yu, YC; Hetzel, JA; Kuo, F; Kim, J; Cokus, SJ; Casero, D; Bernal, M; Huijser, P; Clark, AT; Kramer, U; Merchant, SS; Zhang, XY; Jacobsen, SE; Pellegrini, M",388.0,"[Chodavarapu, Ramakrishna K.; Feng, Suhua; Bernatavichute, Yana V.; Chen, Pao-Yang; Stroud, Hume; Hetzel, Jonathan A.; Kuo, Frank; Kim, Jin; Cokus, Shawn J.; Casero, David; Clark, Amander T.; Jacobsen, Steven E.; Pellegrini, Matteo] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Mol Cell & Dev Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Feng, Suhua; Jacobsen, Steven E.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Bernatavichute, Yana V.; Merchant, Sabeeha S.; Jacobsen, Steven E.; Pellegrini, Matteo] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Mol Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Yu, Yanchun; Zhang, Xiaoyu] Univ Georgia, Dept Plant Biol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Bernal, Maria; Kraemer, Ute] Univ Heidelberg, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Huijser, Peter] Max Planck Inst Plant Breeding Res, Dept Mol Plant Genet, D-50829 Cologne, Germany; [Clark, Amander T.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Eli & Edythe Broad Ctr Regenerat Med & Stem Cell, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Merchant, Sabeeha S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Chem & Biochem, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09147,Article,,jacobsen@ucla.edu; matteop@mcdb.ucla.edu,392,"Department of Energy, Institute for Genomics and Proteomics; NIH [GM07104, GM60398, GM42143]; Eli & Edythe Broad Center of Regenerative Medicine & Stem Cell Research at UCLA; Alexander-von-Humboldt Fellowship; Heisenberg Fellowship; University of Georgia [JR-040]; NSF [0701745]","We thank members of our laboratories for input and guidance, and the Department of Energy, Institute for Genomics and Proteomics for support.

137,211,87.0,"Non-invasive imaging deep into organs at microscopic scales remains an open quest in biomedical imaging. Although optical microscopy is still limited to surface imaging owing to optical wave diffusion and fast decorrelation in tissue, revolutionary approaches such as fluorescence photo-activated localization microscopy led to a striking increase in resolution by more than an order of magnitude in the last decade(1). In contrast with optics, ultrasonic waves propagate deep into organs without losing their coherence and are much less affected by in vivo decorrelation processes. However, their resolution is impeded by the fundamental limits of diffraction, which impose a long-standing trade-off between resolution and penetration. This limits clinical and preclinical ultrasound imaging to a sub-millimetre scale. Here we demonstrate in vivo that ultrasound imaging at ultrafast frame rates (more than 500 frames per second) provides an analogue to optical localization microscopy by capturing the transient signal decorrelation of contrast agents-inert gas microbubbles. Ultrafast ultrasound localization microscopy allowed both non-invasive sub-wavelength structural imaging and haemodynamic quantification of rodent cerebral microvessels (less than ten micrometres in diameter) more than ten millimetres below the tissue surface, leading to transcranial whole-brain imaging within short acquisition times (tens of seconds). After intravenous injection, single echoes from individual microbubbles were detected through ultrafast imaging. Their localization, not limited by diffraction, was accumulated over 75,000 images, yielding 1,000,000 events per coronal plane and statistically independent pixels of ten micrometres in size. Precise temporal tracking of microbubble positions allowed us to extract accurately in-plane velocities of the blood flow with a large dynamic range (from one millimetre per second to several centimetres per second). These results pave the way for deep non-invasive microscopy in animals and humans using ultrasound. We anticipate that ultrafast ultrasound localization microscopy may become an invaluable tool for the fundamental understanding and diagnostics of various disease processes that modify the microvascular blood flow, such as cancer, stroke and arteriosclerosis.","Errico, Claudia; Pierre, Juliette; Pezet, Sophie; Desailly, Yann; Lenkei, Zsolt; Couture, Olivier; Tanter, Mickael","Rrico, CE; Pierre, J; Pezet, S; Desailly, Y; Lenkei, Z; Couture, O; Tanter, M",499.0,"[Errico, Claudia; Pierre, Juliette; Desailly, Yann; Couture, Olivier; Tanter, Mickael] INSERM, Inst Langevin, F-75005 Paris, France; [Errico, Claudia; Pierre, Juliette; Desailly, Yann; Couture, Olivier; Tanter, Mickael] PSL Res Univ, ESPCI ParisTech, Inst Langevin, F-75005 Paris, France; [Errico, Claudia; Pierre, Juliette; Desailly, Yann; Couture, Olivier; Tanter, Mickael] CNRS, UMR 7587, F-75005 Paris, France; [Pezet, Sophie; Lenkei, Zsolt] CNRS, UMR 8249, F-75005 Paris, France; [Pezet, Sophie; Lenkei, Zsolt] PSL Res Univ, ESPCI ParisTech, Brain Plast Unit, F-75005 Paris, France",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature16066,Article,1476-4687,mickael.tanter@espci.fr,+,"Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR), within the project ANR MUSLI; Fondation Pierre-Gilles de Gennes; LABEX WIFI (Laboratory of Excellence) within the French Program ""Investments for the Future"" [ANR-10-LABX-24, ANR-10-IDEX-0001-02 PSL*]","This work was supported principally by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR), within the project ANR MUSLI.

138,323,438.0,"Intraspecific variability in social organization is common, yet the underlying causes are rarely known(1-3). In the fire ant Solenopsis invicta, the existence of two divergent forms of social organization is under the control of a single Mendelian genomic element marked by two variants of an odorant-binding protein gene(4-8). Here we characterize the genomic region responsible for this important social polymorphism, and show that it is part of a pair of heteromorphic chromosomes that have many of the key properties of sex chromosomes. The two variants, hereafter referred to as the social B and social b (SB and Sb) chromosomes, are characterized by a large region of approximately 13 megabases (55% of the chromosome) in which recombination is completely suppressed between SB and Sb. Recombination seems to occur normally between the SB chromosomes but not between Sb chromosomes because Sb/Sb individuals are non-viable. Genomic comparisons revealed limited differentiation between SB and Sb, and the vast majority of the 616 genes identified in the non-recombining region are present in the two variants. The lack of recombination over more than half of the two heteromorphic social chromosomes can be explained by at least one large inversion of around 9 megabases, and this absence of recombination has led to the accumulation of deleterious mutations, including repetitive elements in the non-recombining region of Sb compared with the homologous region of SB. Importantly, most of the genes with demonstrated expression differences between individuals of the two social forms reside in the non-recombining region. These findings highlight how genomic rearrangements can maintain divergent adaptive social phenotypes involving many genes acting together by locally limiting recombination.","Wang, John; Wurm, Yannick; Nipitwattanaphon, Mingkwan; Riba-Grognuz, Oksana; Huang, Yu-Ching; Shoemaker, DeWayne; Keller, Laurent","Wang, J; Wurm, Y; Nipitwattanaphon, M; Riba-Grognuz, O; Huang, YC; Shoemaker, D; Keller, L",664.0,"[Wang, John; Wurm, Yannick; Nipitwattanaphon, Mingkwan; Riba-Grognuz, Oksana; Keller, Laurent] Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Wang, John; Huang, Yu-Ching] Acad Sinica, Biodivers Res Ctr, Taipei 115, Taiwan; [Wurm, Yannick] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, London E1 4NS, England; [Wurm, Yannick; Riba-Grognuz, Oksana] Swiss Inst Bioinformat, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Shoemaker, DeWayne] USDA ARS, Ctr Med Agr & Vet Entomol, Gainesville, FL 32608 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11832,Article,,johnwang@gate.sinica.edu.tw; y.wurm@qmul.ac.uk; laurent.keller@unil.ch,668,"Biodiversity Research Center (Academia Sinica, Taiwan), Taiwan NSC [100-2311-B-001-015-MY3]; NERC; BBSRC [BB/K004204/1]; USDA; Swiss NSF; ERC","We thank C.

140,77,477.0,"Eukaryotic DNA replication uses kinase regulatory pathways to facilitate coordination with other processes during cell division cycles and response to environmental cues. At least two cell cycle-regulated protein kinase systems, the S-phase-specific cyclin-dependent protein kinases (S-CDKs) and the Dbf4-Cdc7 kinase (DDK, Dbf4-dependent protein kinase) are essential activators for initiation of DNA replication(1-5). Although the essential mechanism of CDK activation of DNA replication in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been established(6,7), exactly how DDK acts has been unclear. Here we show that the amino terminal serine/threonine-rich domain (NSD) of Mcm4 has both inhibitory and facilitating roles in DNA replication control and that the sole essential function of DDK is to relieve an inhibitory activity residing within the NSD. By combining an mcm4 mutant lacking the inhibitory activity with mutations that bypass the requirement for CDKs for initiation of DNA replication, we show that DNA synthesis can occur in G1 phase when CDKs and DDK are limited. However, DDK is still required for efficient S phase progression. In the absence of DDK, CDK phosphorylation at the distal part of the Mcm4 NSD becomes crucial. Moreover, DDK-null cells fail to activate the intra-S-phase checkpoint in the presence of hydroxyurea-induced DNA damage and are unable to survive this challenge. Our studies establish that the eukaryote-specific NSD of Mcm4 has evolved to integrate several protein kinase regulatory signals for progression through S phase.","Sheu, Yi-Jun; Stillman, Bruce","Sheu, YJ; Stillman, B",113.0,"[Sheu, Yi-Jun; Stillman, Bruce] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08647,Article,,stillman@cshl.edu,U127,US National Institute of General Medical Sciences,"Acknowledgements We thank A.

141,184,423.0,"Quantum information science involves the storage, manipulation and communication of information encoded in quantum systems, where the phenomena of superposition and entanglement can provide enhancements over what is possible classically(1,2). Large-scale quantum information processors require stable and addressable quantum memories, usually in the form of fixed quantum bits ( qubits), and a means of transferring and entangling the quantum information between memories that may be separated by macroscopic or even geographic distances. Atomic systems are excellent quantum memories, because appropriate internal electronic states can coherently store qubits over very long timescales. Photons, on the other hand, are the natural platform for the distribution of quantum information between remote qubits, given their ability to traverse large distances with little perturbation. Recently, there has been considerable progress in coupling small samples of atomic gases through photonic channels(2,3), including the entanglement between light and atoms(4,5) and the observation of entanglement signatures between remotely located atomic ensembles(6) (-8). In contrast to atomic ensembles, single-atom quantum memories allow the implementation of conditional quantum gates through photonic channels2,9, a key requirement for quantum computing. Along these lines, individual atoms have been coupled to photons in cavities(2,10-12), and trapped atoms have been linked to emitted photons in free space(13-17). Here we demonstrate the entanglement of two fixed single-atom quantum memories separated by one metre. Two remotely located trapped atomic ions each emit a single photon, and the interference and detection of these photons signals the entanglement of the atomic qubits. We characterize the entangled pair by directly measuring qubit correlations with near-perfect detection efficiency. Although this entanglement method is probabilistic, it is still in principle useful for subsequent quantum operations and scalable quantum information applications(18-20).","Moehring, D.

144,170,221.0,"Periodic mesoporous materials formed through the cooperative self-assembly of surfactants and framework building blocks can assume a variety of structures(1-3), and their widely tuneable properties make them attractive hosts for numerous applications(4-7). Because the molecular movement in the pore system is the most important and defining characteristic of porous materials(8), it is of interest to learn about this behaviour as a function of local structure. Generally, individual fluorescent dye molecules can be used as molecular beacons with which to explore the structure of-and the dynamics within-these porous hosts(9-13), and single-molecule fluorescence techniques provide detailed insights into the dynamics of various processes, ranging from biology(14,15) to heterogeneous catalysis(16). However, optical microscopy methods cannot directly image the mesoporous structure of the host system accommodating the diffusing molecules, whereas transmission electron microscopy provides detailed images of the porous structure(17), but no dynamic information. It has therefore not been possible to 'see' how molecules diffuse in a real nanoscale pore structure. Here we present a combination of electron microscopic mapping and optical single-molecule tracking experiments to reveal how a single luminescent dye molecule travels through linear or strongly curved sections of a mesoporous channel system. In our approach we directly correlate porous structures detected by transmission electron microscopy with the diffusion dynamics of single molecules detected by optical microscopy. This opens up new ways of understanding the interactions of host and guest.","Zuerner, Andreas; Kirstein, Johanna; Doeblinger, Markus; Braeuchle, Christoph; Bein, Thomas","Zurner, A; Kirstein, J; Doblinger, M; Brauchle, C; Bein, T",705.0,"Univ Munich, Dept Chem & Biochem, D-81377 Munich, Germany; Univ Munich, Ctr NanoSci, D-81377 Munich, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06398,Article,,bein@lmu.de,+,,,235BY,,,SILICA; DYNAMICS; TRACKING; PORES; FILMS,7170.0,NATURE,Nature,English,21.0,No,"Bein, Thomas/0000-0001-7248-5906","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",29-Nov,5.0,LONDON,18046407.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007.0,"Bein, Thomas/G-7686-2014","Zurner, A (reprint author), Univ Munich, Dept Chem & Biochem, Butenandtstr 5-13 E, D-81377 Munich, Germany.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,134.0,Visualizing single-molecule diffusion in mesoporous materials,6.0,114.0,WOS:000251209700050,221.0,450,Multidisciplinary Sciences,134,thomas,bein,28289.0,3753,male,1.0,gU1pu4kAAAAJ,5,"(17929, ]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
145,102,291.0,"The onset of vision occurs when neural circuits in the visual cortex are immature, lacking both the full complement of connections(1,2) and the response selectivity that defines functional maturity(3,4). Direction- selective responses are particularly vulnerable to the effects of early visual deprivation, but it remains unclear how stimulus- driven neural activity guides the emergence of cortical direction selectivity. Here we report observations from a motion training protocol that allowed us to monitor the impact of experience on the development of direction- selective responses in visually naive ferrets. Using intrinsic signal imaging techniques, we found that training with a single axis of motion induced the rapid emergence of direction columns that were confined to cortical regions preferentially activated by the training stimulus. Using two- photon calcium imaging techniques, we found that single neurons in visually naive animals exhibited weak directional biases and lacked the strong local coherence in the spatial organization of direction preference that was evident in mature animals. Training with a moving stimulus, but not with a flashed stimulus, strengthened the direction- selective responses of individual neurons and preferentially reversed the direction biases of neurons that deviated from their neighbours. Both effects contributed to an increase in local coherence. We conclude that early experience with moving visual stimuli drives the rapid emergence of direction-selective responses in the visual cortex.","Li, Ye; Van Hooser, Stephen D.; Mazurek, Mark; White, Leonard E.; Fitzpatrick, David","Li, Y; Van Hooser, SD; Mazurek, M; White, LE; Fitzpatrick, D",952.0,"[Li, Ye; Van Hooser, Stephen D.; Mazurek, Mark; White, Leonard E.; Fitzpatrick, David] Duke Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [White, Leonard E.] Duke Univ, Sch Med, Dept Community & Family Med, Doctor Phys Therapy Div, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Fitzpatrick, David] Duke Univ, Duke Inst Brain Sci, Durham, NC 27710 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07417,Article,,fitzpat@neuro.duke.edu,956,Whitehall Foundation; US National Institutes of Health,"The authors thank P.

146,318,385.0,"Recent studies suggest that electrides-ionic crystals in which electrons serve as anions-are not exceptional materials but rather a generalized form, particularly under high pressure(1-3). The topology of the cavities confining anionic electrons determines their physical.properties(4). At present, reported confining sites consist only of zero-dimensional cavities or weakly linked channels(4). Here we report a layered-structure electride of dicalcium nitride, Ca2N, which possesses two-dimensionally confined anionic electrons whose concentration agrees well with that for the chemical formula of [Ca2N](+).e(-). Two-dimensional transport characteristics are demonstrated by a high electron mobility (520 cm(2) V-1 s(-1)) and long mean scattering time (0.6 picoseconds) with a mean free path of 0.12 micrometres. The quadratic temperature dependence of the resistivity up to 120 Kelvin indicates the presence of an electron-electron interaction. A striking anisotropic magnetoresistance behaviour with respect to the direction of magnetic field (negative for the field perpendicular to the conducting plane and positive for the field parallel to it) is observed, confirming diffusive two-dimensional transport in dense electron layers. Additionally, band calculations support confinement of anionic electrons within the interlayer space, and photoemission measurements confirm anisotropic low work functions of 3.5 and 2.6 electronvolts, revealing the loosely bound nature of the anionic electrons. We conclude that Ca2N is a two-dimensional electride in terms of [Ca2N](+).e(-).","Lee, Kimoon; Kim, Sung Wng; Toda, Yoshitake; Matsuishi, Satoru; Hosono, Hideo","Lee, K; Kim, SW; Toda, Y; Matsuishi, S; Hosono, H",336.0,"[Lee, Kimoon; Kim, Sung Wng; Toda, Yoshitake; Hosono, Hideo] Tokyo Inst Technol, Frontier Res Ctr, Midori Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2268503, Japan; [Kim, Sung Wng] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Energy Sci, Suwon 440746, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Matsuishi, Satoru; Hosono, Hideo] Tokyo Inst Technol, Mat & Struct Lab, Midori Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2268503, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11812,Article,1476-4687,hosono@msl.titech.ac.jp,340,"Funding Program for World-Leading Innovative R&D On Science and Technology (FIRST); JSPS; Element Strategy Initiative Project, MEXT, Japan","This work was supported by the Funding Program for World-Leading Innovative R&D On Science and Technology (FIRST), JSPS, and the Element Strategy Initiative Project, MEXT, Japan.",095CS,,,TEMPERATURE STABLE ELECTRIDE; ROOM-TEMPERATURE; WORK FUNCTION; ALUMINUM; SURFACE; CA2N,7437.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,"Hosono, Hideo/0000-0001-9260-6728","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",21-Feb,5.0,LONDON,23364689.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2013.0,"Kim, Sung Wng/A-4747-2013; Hosono, Hideo/J-3489-2013","Hosono, H (reprint author), Tokyo Inst Technol, Frontier Res Ctr, Midori Ku, 4259 Nagatsuta, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2268503, Japan.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,74.0,Dicalcium nitride as a two-dimensional electride with an anionic electron layer,18.0,242.0,WOS:000315312900034,385.0,494,Multidisciplinary Sciences,75,hideo,hosono,80092.0,8,male,1.0,0Uon_c8AAAAJ,5,"(17929, ]",38482827,1,38482827,1,Hideo Hosono,Hideo Hosono,1,1

148,327,464.0,"Hyperconnectivity of neuronal circuits due to increased synaptic protein synthesis is thought to cause autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is strongly implicated in ASDs by means of upstream signalling; however, downstream regulatory mechanisms are ill-defined. Here we show that knockout of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 2 (4E-BP2)-an eIF4E repressor downstream of mTOR-or eIF4E overexpression leads to increased translation of neuroligins, which are postsynaptic proteins that are causally linked to ASDs. Mice that have the gene encoding 4E-BP2 (Eif4ebp2) knocked out exhibit an increased ratio of excitatory to inhibitory synaptic inputs and autistic-like behaviours (that is, social interaction deficits, altered communication and repetitive/stereotyped behaviours). Pharmacological inhibition of eIF4E activity or normalization of neuroligin 1, but not neuroligin 2, protein levels restores the normal excitation/inhibition ratio and rectifies the social behaviour deficits. Thus, translational control by eIF4E regulates the synthesis of neuroligins, maintaining the excitation-to-inhibition balance, and its dysregulation engenders ASD-like phenotypes.","Gkogkas, Christos G.; Khoutorsky, Arkady; Ran, Israeli; Rampakakis, Emmanouil; Nevarko, Tatiana; Weatherill, Daniel B.; Vasuta, Cristina; Yee, Stephanie; Truitt, Morgan; Dallaire, Paul; Major, Francois; Lasko, Paul; Ruggero, Davide; Nader, Karim; Lacaille, Jean-Claude; Sonenberg, Nahum","Gkogkas, CG; Khoutorsky, A; Ran, I; Rampakakis, E; Nevarko, T; Weatherill, DB; Vasuta, C; Yee, S; Truitt, M; Dallaire, P; Major, F; Lasko, P; Ruggero, D; Nader, K; Lacaille, JC; Sonenberg, N",371.0,"[Gkogkas, Christos G.; Khoutorsky, Arkady; Rampakakis, Emmanouil; Nevarko, Tatiana; Sonenberg, Nahum] McGill Univ, Dept Biochem, Montreal, PQ H3A 1A3, Canada; [Gkogkas, Christos G.; Khoutorsky, Arkady; Rampakakis, Emmanouil; Nevarko, Tatiana; Sonenberg, Nahum] McGill Univ, Goodman Canc Res Ctr, Montreal, PQ H3A 1A3, Canada; [Ran, Israeli; Weatherill, Daniel B.; Vasuta, Cristina; Lacaille, Jean-Claude] Univ Montreal, GRSNC, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Ran, Israeli; Weatherill, Daniel B.; Vasuta, Cristina; Lacaille, Jean-Claude] Univ Montreal, Dept Physiol, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Rampakakis, Emmanouil] JSS Med Res Inc, Montreal, PQ H4S 1N8, Canada; [Yee, Stephanie; Lasko, Paul] McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H3G 0B1, Canada; [Truitt, Morgan; Ruggero, Davide] Univ Calif San Francisco, Sch Med, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Truitt, Morgan; Ruggero, Davide] Univ Calif San Francisco, Helen Diller Family Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dept Urol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Dallaire, Paul; Major, Francois] Univ Montreal, Dept Comp Sci, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Dallaire, Paul; Major, Francois] Univ Montreal, Inst Res Immunol & Canc, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Nader, Karim] McGill Univ, Dept Psychol, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11628,Article,,jean-claude.lacaille@umontreal.ca; nahum.sonenberg@mcgill.ca,U113,"Canadian Institutes of Health Research [MOP-114994, MOP-10848, MOP-93679, MOP-44050]; Autism Speaks [7109]; Fonds de la Recherche en Sante du Quebec (FRSQ; Groupe de Recherche sur le Systeme Nerveux Central); National Institutes of Health [NIH RO1 CA154916, NIH RO1 CA140456]; Canada Research Chair in Cellular and Molecular Neurophysiology; Savoy Foundation","This work was supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (N.S., MOP-114994; J.-C.L., MOP-10848; P.D. and F.M., MOP-93679; and P.L. and N.S., MOP-44050), Autism Speaks (Grant 7109 to N.S.), and the Fonds de la Recherche en Sante du Quebec (J.-C.L.

149,357,292.0,"In humans, up to 75% of newly generated B cells and about 30% of mature B cells show some degree of autoreactivity(1). Yet, how B cells establish and maintain tolerance in the face of autoantigen exposure during and after development is not certain. Studies of model B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) transgenic systems have highlighted the critical role of functional unresponsiveness or 'anergy'(2,3). Unlike T cells, evidence suggests that receptor editing and anergy, rather than deletion, account for much of B-cell tolerance(4,5). However, it remains unclear whether the mature diverse B-cell repertoire of mice contains anergic autoreactive B cells, and if so, whether antigen was encountered during or after their development. By taking advantage of a reporter mouse in which BCR signalling rapidly and robustly induces green fluorescent protein expression under the control of the Nur77 regulatory region, antigen-dependent and antigen-independent BCR signalling events in vivo during B-cell maturation were visualized. Here we show that B cells encounter antigen during development in the spleen, and that this antigen exposure, in turn, tunes the responsiveness of BCR signalling in B cells at least partly by downmodulating expression of surface IgM but not IgD BCRs, and by modifying basal calcium levels. By contrast, no analogous process occurs in naive mature T cells. Our data demonstrate not only that autoreactive B cells persist in the mature repertoire, but that functional unresponsiveness or anergy exists in the mature B-cell repertoire along a continuum, a fact that has long been suspected, but never yet shown. These results have important implications for understanding how tolerance in T and B cells is differently imposed, and how these processes might go awry in disease.","Zikherman, Julie; Parameswaran, Ramya; Weiss, Arthur","Zikherman, J; Parameswaran, R; Weiss, A",160.0,"[Zikherman, Julie; Parameswaran, Ramya; Weiss, Arthur] Univ Calif San Francisco, Rosalind Russell Med Res Ctr Arthrit, Dept Med, Div Rheumatol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Weiss, Arthur] Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11311,Article,,aweiss@medicine.ucsf.edu,U185,Rosalind Russell Medical Research Foundation Bechtel Award; American College of Rheumatology REF Rheumatology Investigator Award; Arthritis National Research Foundation; National Institutes of Health [K08 AR059723]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute,"We thank A.

150,386,187.0,"Acetals are molecular substructures that contain two oxygencarbon single bonds at the same carbon atom, and are used in cells to construct carbohydrates and numerous other molecules. A distinctive subgroup are spiroacetals, acetals joining two rings, which occur in a broad range of biologically active compounds, including small insect pheromones and more complex macrocycles(1,2). Despite numerous methods for the catalytic asymmetric formation of other commonly occurring stereocentres, there are few approaches that exclusively target the chiral acetal centre and none for spiroacetals(3,4). Here we report the design and synthesis of confined Bronsted acids based on a C-2-symmetric imidodiphosphoric acid motif, enabling a catalytic enantioselective spiroacetalization reaction. These rationally constructed Bronsted acids possess an extremely sterically demanding chiral microenvironment, with a single catalytically relevant and geometrically constrained bifunctional active site. Our catalyst design is expected to be of broad utility in catalytic asymmetric reactions involving small and structurally or functionally unbiased substrates.","Coric, Ilija; List, Benjamin","Coric, I; List, B",315.0,"[Coric, Ilija; List, Benjamin] Max Planck Inst Kohlenforsch, D-45470 Mulheim, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10932,Article,,list@kofo.mpg.de,319,Max Planck Sociey; European Research Council,"We thank A.

151,320,396.0,"Ribosomes, the protein factories of living cells, translate genetic information carried by messenger RNAs into proteins, and are thus involved in virtually all aspects of cellular development and maintenance. The few available structures of the eukaryotic ribosome(1-6) reveal that it is more complex than its prokaryotic counterpart(7,8), owing mainly to the presence of eukaryote-specific ribosomal proteins and additional ribosomal RNA insertions, called expansion segments(9). The structures also differ among species, partly in the size and arrangement of these expansion segments. Such differences are extreme in kinetoplastids, unicellular eukaryotic parasites often infectious to humans. Here we present a high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of the ribosome of Trypanosoma brucei, the parasite that is transmitted by the tsetse fly and that causes African sleeping sickness. The atomic model reveals the unique features of this ribosome, characterized mainly by the presence of unusually large expansion segments and ribosomal-protein extensions leading to the formation of four additional inter-subunit bridges. We also find additional rRNA insertions, including one large rRNA domain that is not found in other eukaryotes. Furthermore, the structure reveals the five cleavage sites of the kinetoplastid large ribosomal subunit (LSU) rRNA chain, which is known to be cleaved uniquely into six pieces(10-12), and suggests that the cleavage is important for the maintenance of the T. brucei ribosome in the observed structure. We discuss several possible implications of the large rRNA expansion segments for the translation-regulation process. The structure could serve as a basis for future experiments aimed at understanding the functional importance of these kinetoplastid-specific ribosomal features in protein-translation regulation, an essential step towards finding effective and safe kinetoplastid-specific drugs.","Hashem, Yaser; Georges, Amedee des; Fu, Jie; Buss, Sarah N.; Jossinet, Fabrice; Jobe, Amy; Zhang, Qin; Liao, Hstau Y.; Grassucci, Robert A.; Bajaj, Chandrajit; Westhof, Eric; Madison-Antenucci, Susan; Frank, Joachim","Hashem, Y; Georges, AD; Fu, J; Buss, SN; Jossinet, F; Jobe, A; Zhang, Q; Liao, HY; Grassucci, RA; Bajaj, C; Westhof, E; Madison-Antenucci, S; Frank, J",385.0,"[Hashem, Yaser; Georges, Amedee des; Grassucci, Robert A.; Frank, Joachim] Columbia Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, Howard Hughes Med Inst HHMI, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Fu, Jie; Liao, Hstau Y.; Frank, Joachim] Columbia Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Buss, Sarah N.; Madison-Antenucci, Susan] New York State Dept Hlth, Div Infect Dis, Wadsworth Ctr, Albany, NY 12201 USA; [Jossinet, Fabrice; Westhof, Eric] Univ Strasbourg, Inst Biol Mol & Cellulaire CNRS, Architecture & Reactivite ARN, F-67084 Strasbourg, France; [Jobe, Amy; Frank, Joachim] Columbia Univ, Dept Biol Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Zhang, Qin; Bajaj, Chandrajit] Univ Texas Austin, Inst Computat Engn & Sci, Dept Comp Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11872,Article,1476-4687,jf2192@columbia.edu,389,"Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI); National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R01 GM29169]; L'Agence Nationale de la recherche (ANR) project AMIS ARN [ANR-09-BLAN-0160]; NIH [R01-EB004873, R01-GM074258]; Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Emerging Infectious Diseases (EID) fellowship program","This work is dedicated to the memory of Mariano Levin, who collaborated with J.F. and S.M.A. on the ribosomes from T. cruzi and T. brucei.

152,183,411.0,"The concept of local-scale interactions driving large-scale pattern formation has been supported by numerical simulations, which have demonstrated that simple rules of interaction are capable of reproducing patterns observed in nature(1,2). These models of self-organization suggest that characteristic patterns should exist across a broad range of environmental conditions provided that local interactions do indeed dominate the development of community structure. Readily available observations that could be used to support these theoretical expectations, however, have lacked sufficient spatial extent or the necessary diversity of environmental conditions to confirm the model predictions. We use high-resolution satellite imagery to document the prevalence of self-organized vegetation patterns across a regional rainfall gradient in southern Africa, where percent tree cover ranges from 65% to 4%. Through the application of a cellular automata model, we find that the observed power-law distributions of tree canopy cluster sizes can arise from the interacting effects of global-scale resource constraints (that is, water availability) and local-scale facilitation. Positive local feedbacks result in power-law distributions without entailing threshold behaviour commonly associated with criticality. Our observations provide a framework for integrating a diverse suite of previous studies that have addressed either mean wet season rainfall or landscape-scale soil moisture variability as controls on the structural dynamics of arid and semi-arid ecosystems.","Scanlon, Todd M.; Caylor, Kelly K.; Levin, Simon A.; Rodriguez-Iturbe, Ignacio","Scanlon, TM; Caylor, KK; Levin, SA; Rodriguez-Iturbe, I",209.0,"Univ Virginia, Dept Environm Sci, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; Indiana Univ, Dept Geog, Bloomington, IN 47401 USA; Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; Princeton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06060,Article,,tms2v@virginia.edu,U4,,,209NF,,,LOCAL INTERACTIONS; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; DYNAMICS; DISTURBANCE; SIGNATURES; SAVANNAS; ECOLOGY; FORESTS; AFRICA; MODEL,7159.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,"Caylor, Kelly/0000-0002-6466-6448; Scanlon, Todd/0000-0001-8869-1675","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",13-Sep,5.0,LONDON,17851523.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007.0,"Caylor, Kelly/B-7734-2008; Scanlon, Todd/B-8743-2008","Scanlon, TM (reprint author), Univ Virginia, Dept Environm Sci, Clark Hall, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,194.0,Positive feedbacks promote power-law clustering of Kalahari vegetation,3.0,73.0,WOS:000249394500048,411.0,449,Multidisciplinary Sciences,198,ignacio,rodriguez-iturbe,28547.0,451,male,1.0,GSyUS9wAAAAJ,5,"(17929, ]",16067675,1,1858623,1,Ignacio Rodriguez-Iturbe,Ignacio Rodriguez-Iturbe,1,1
