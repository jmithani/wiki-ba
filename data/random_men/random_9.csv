0,45,182.0,"The microtubule cytoskeleton is essential to cell morphogenesis. Growing microtubule plus ends have emerged as dynamic regulatory sites in which specialized proteins, called plus- end- binding proteins ( + TIPs), bind and regulate the proper functioning of microtubules(1-4). However, the molecular mechanism of plus- end association by + TIPs and their ability to track the growing end are not well understood. Here we report the in vitro reconstitution of a minimal plus- end tracking system consisting of the three fission yeast proteins Mal3, Tip1 and the kinesin Tea2. Using time- lapse total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we show that the EB1 homologue Mal3 has an enhanced affinity for growing microtubule end structures as opposed to the microtubule lattice. This allows it to track growing microtubule ends autonomously by an end recognition mechanism. In addition, Mal3 acts as a factor that mediates loading of the processive motor Tea2 and its cargo, the Clip170 homologue Tip1, onto the microtubule lattice. The interaction of all three proteins is required for the selective tracking of growing microtubule plus ends by both Tea2 and Tip1. Our results dissect the collective interactions of the constituents of this plus-end tracking system and show how these interactions lead to the emergence of its dynamic behaviour. We expect that such in vitro reconstitutions will also be essential for the mechanistic dissection of other plus- end tracking systems.","Bieling, Peter; Laan, Liedewij; Schek, Henry; Munteanu, E.

1,123,191.0,"The ability to learn new skills and perfect them with practice applies not only to physical skills but also to abstract skills(1), like motor planning or neuroprosthetic actions. Although plasticity in corticostriatal circuits has been implicated in learning physical skills(2-4), it remains unclear if similar circuits or processes are required for abstract skill learning. Here we use a novel behavioural task in rodents to investigate the role of corticostriatal plasticity in abstract skill learning. Rodents learned to control the pitch of an auditory cursor to reach one of two targets by modulating activity in primary motor cortex irrespective of physical movement. Degradation of the relation between action and outcome, as well as sensory-specific devaluation and omission tests, demonstrate that these learned neuroprosthetic actions are intentional and goal-directed, rather than habitual. Striatal neurons change their activity with learning, with more neurons modulating their activity in relation to target-reaching as learning progresses. Concomitantly, strong relations between the activity of neurons in motor cortex and the striatum emerge. Specific deletion of striatal NMDA receptors impairs the development of this corticostriatal plasticity, and disrupts the ability to learn neuroprosthetic skills. These results suggest that corticostriatal plasticity is necessary for abstract skill learning, and that neuroprosthetic movements capitalize on the neural circuitry involved in natural motor learning.","Koralek, Aaron C.; Jin, Xin; Ii, John D.

2,96,165.0,"Understanding the origins of the diversity in terrestrial planets is a fundamental goal in Earth and planetary sciences. In the Solar System, Venus has a similar size and bulk composition to those of Earth, but it lacks water(1-3). Because a richer variety of exoplanets is expected to be discovered, prediction of their atmospheres and surface environments requires a general framework for planetary evolution. Here we show that terrestrial planets can be divided into two distinct types on the basis of their evolutionary history during solidification from the initially hot molten state expected from the standard formation model(4,5). Even if, apart from their orbits, they were identical just after formation, the solidified planets can have different characteristics. A type I planet, which is formed beyond a certain critical distance from the host star, solidifies within several million years. If the planet acquires water during formation, most of this water is retained and forms the earliest oceans. In contrast, on a type II planet, which is formed inside the critical distance, a magma ocean can be sustained for longer, even with a larger initial amount of water. Its duration could be as long as 100 million years if the planet is formed together with a mass of water comparable to the total inventory of the modern Earth. Hydrodynamic escape desiccates type II planets during the slow solidification process. Although Earth is categorized as type I, it is not clear which type Venus is because its orbital distance is close to the critical distance. However, because the dryness of the surface and mantle predicted for type II planets is consistent with the characteristics of Venus, it may be representative of type II planets. Also, future observations may have a chance to detect not only terrestrial exoplanets covered with water ocean but also those covered with magma ocean around a young star.","Hamano, Keiko; Abe, Yutaka; Genda, Hidenori","Hamano, K; Abe, Y; Genda, H",607.0,"[Hamano, Keiko; Abe, Yutaka; Genda, Hidenori] Univ Tokyo, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Genda, Hidenori] Tokyo Inst Technol, Earth Life Sci Inst, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1528551, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12163,Article,,keiko@eps.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp,+,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology [23103003]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [23340168, 22740291]","We thank J.F.

3,31,403.0,"Xeroderma pigmentosum is a monogenic disease characterized by hypersensitivity to ultraviolet light. The cells of xeroderma pigmentosum patients are defective in nucleotide excision repair, limiting their capacity to eliminate ultraviolet- induced DNA damage, and resulting in a strong predisposition to develop skin cancers(1). The use of rare cutting DNA endonucleases - such as homing endonucleases, also known as meganucleases - constitutes one possible strategy for repairing DNA lesions. Homing endonucleases have emerged as highly specific molecular scalpels that recognize and cleave DNA sites, promoting efficient homologous gene targeting through double- strand- break- induced homologous recombination. Here we describe two engineered heterodimeric derivatives of the homing endonuclease I- CreI, produced by a semi- rational approach. These two molecules - Amel3 - Amel4 and Ini3 - Ini4 cleave DNA from the human XPC gene ( xeroderma pigmentosum group C), in vitro and in vivo. Crystal structures of the I- CreI variants complexed with intact and cleaved XPC target DNA suggest that the mechanism of DNA recognition and cleavage by the engineered homing endonucleases is similar to that of the wild- type I- CreI. Furthermore, these derivatives induced high levels of specific gene targeting in mammalian cells while displaying no obvious genotoxicity. Thus, homing endonucleases can be designed to recognize and cleave the DNA sequences of specific genes, opening up new possibilities for genome engineering and gene therapy in xeroderma pigmentosum patients whose illness can be treated ex vivo.","Redondo, Pilar; Prieto, Jesus; Munoz, Ines G.; Alibes, Andreu; Stricher, Francois; Serrano, Luis; Cabaniols, Jean-Pierre; Daboussi, Fayza; Arnould, Sylvain; Perez, Christophe; Duchateau, Philippe; Paques, Frederic; Blanco, Francisco J.; Montoya, Guillermo","Redondo, P; Prieto, J; Munoz, IG; Alibes, A; Stricher, F; Serrano, L; Cabaniols, JP; Daboussi, F; Arnould, S; Perez, C; Duchateau, P; Paques, F; Blanco, FJ; Montoya, G",107.0,"[Redondo, Pilar; Munoz, Ines G.; Montoya, Guillermo] Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, Struct Biol & Biocomp Programme, Macromol Crystallog Grp, Madrid 28029, Spain; [Prieto, Jesus; Blanco, Francisco J.] Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, Struct Biol & Biocomp Programme, NMR Grp, Madrid 28029, Spain; [Alibes, Andreu; Stricher, Francois; Serrano, Luis] UPF, European Mol Biol Lab, CRG Syst Biol Unit, CRG, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Serrano, Luis] ICREA, F-93235 Romainville, France; [Cabaniols, Jean-Pierre; Daboussi, Fayza; Arnould, Sylvain; Perez, Christophe; Duchateau, Philippe; Paques, Frederic] CELLECTIS SA, F-93235 Romainville, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07343,Article,,fblanco@cicbiogune.es; gmontoya@cnio.es,U8,EU MEGATOOL [LSHG-CT-2006-037226]; CRG-Novartis fellowship,We would like to thank J.

4,4,373.0,"The development of the human cerebral cortex is an orchestrated process involving the generation of neural progenitors in the periventricular germinal zones, cell proliferation characterized by symmetric and asymmetric mitoses, followed by migration of post-mitotic neurons to their final destinations in six highly ordered, functionally specialized layers(1,2). An understanding of the molecular mechanisms guiding these intricate processes is in its infancy, substantially driven by the discovery of rare mutations that cause malformations of cortical development(3-6). Mapping of disease loci in putative Mendelian forms of malformations of cortical development has been hindered by marked locus heterogeneity, small kindred sizes and diagnostic classifications that may not reflect molecular pathogenesis. Here we demonstrate the use of whole-exome sequencing to overcome these obstacles by identifying recessive mutations in WD repeat domain 62 (WDR62) as the cause of a wide spectrum of severe cerebral cortical malformations including microcephaly, pachygyria with cortical thickening as well as hypoplasia of the corpus callosum. Some patients with mutations in WDR62 had evidence of additional abnormalities including lissencephaly, schizencephaly, polymicrogyria and, in one instance, cerebellar hypoplasia, all traits traditionally regarded as distinct entities. In mice and humans, WDR62 transcripts and protein are enriched in neural progenitors within the ventricular and subventricular zones. Expression of WDR62 in the neocortex is transient, spanning the period of embryonic neurogenesis. Unlike other known microcephaly genes, WDR62 does not apparently associate with centrosomes and is predominantly nuclear in localization. These findings unify previously disparate aspects of cerebral cortical development and highlight the use of whole-exome sequencing to identify disease loci in settings in which traditional methods have proved challenging.","Bilguvar, Kaya; Ozturk, Ali Kemal; Louvi, Angeliki; Kwan, Kenneth Y.; Choi, Murim; Tatli, Burak; Yalnizoglu, Dilek; Tuysuz, Beyhan; Caglayan, Ahmet Okay; Gokben, Sarenur; Kaymakcalan, Hande; Barak, Tanyeri; Bakircioglu, Mehmet; Yasuno, Katsuhito; Ho, Winson; Sanders, Stephan; Zhu, Ying; Yilmaz, Sanem; Dincer, Alp; Johnson, Michele H.; Bronen, Richard A.; Kocer, Naci; Per, Hueseyin; Mane, Shrikant; Pamir, Mehmet Necmettin; Yalcinkaya, Cengiz; Kumandas, Sefer; Topcu, Meral; Ozmen, Meral; Sestan, Nenad; Lifton, Richard P.; State, Matthew W.; Gunel, Murat","Bilguvar, K; Ozturk, AK; Louvi, A; Kwan, KY; Choi, M; Tatli, B; Yalnizoglu, D; Tuysuz, B; Caglayan, AO; Gokben, S; Kaymakcalan, H; Barak, T; Bakircioglu, M; Yasuno, K; Ho, W; Sanders, S; Zhu, Y; Yilmaz, S; Dincer, A; Johnson, MH; Bronen, RA; Kocer, N; Per, H; Mane, S; Pamir, MN; Yalcinkaya, C; Kumandas, S; Topcu, M; Ozmen, M; Sestan, N; Lifton, RP; State, MW; Gunel, M",207.0,"[Bilguvar, Kaya; Ozturk, Ali Kemal; Louvi, Angeliki; Choi, Murim; Barak, Tanyeri; Bakircioglu, Mehmet; Yasuno, Katsuhito; Ho, Winson; Sanders, Stephan; Mane, Shrikant; Lifton, Richard P.; State, Matthew W.; Gunel, Murat] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Ctr Human Genet & Genom, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Bilguvar, Kaya; Ozturk, Ali Kemal; Louvi, Angeliki; Choi, Murim; Barak, Tanyeri; Bakircioglu, Mehmet; Yasuno, Katsuhito; Ho, Winson; Sanders, Stephan; Mane, Shrikant; Lifton, Richard P.; State, Matthew W.; Gunel, Murat] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Program Neurogenet, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Bilguvar, Kaya; Ozturk, Ali Kemal; Louvi, Angeliki; Barak, Tanyeri; Bakircioglu, Mehmet; Yasuno, Katsuhito; Ho, Winson; Johnson, Michele H.; Bronen, Richard A.; Gunel, Murat] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosurg, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Bilguvar, Kaya; Ozturk, Ali Kemal; Louvi, Angeliki; Kwan, Kenneth Y.; Barak, Tanyeri; Bakircioglu, Mehmet; Yasuno, Katsuhito; Ho, Winson; Zhu, Ying; Sestan, Nenad; Gunel, Murat] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Kwan, Kenneth Y.; Zhu, Ying; Sestan, Nenad] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Kavli Inst Neurosci, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Tatli, Burak; Ozmen, Meral] Istanbul Univ, Istanbul Fac Med, Dept Pediat, Div Neurol, TR-34093 Istanbul, Turkey; [Yalnizoglu, Dilek; Topcu, Meral] Hacettepe Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Div Neurol, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey; [Tuysuz, Beyhan] Istanbul Univ, Cerrahpasa Fac Med, Dept Pediat, Div Genet, TR-34098 Istanbul, Turkey; [Caglayan, Ahmet Okay] Kayseri Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Med Genet, TR-38010 Kayseri, Turkey; [Gokben, Sarenur; Yilmaz, Sanem] Ege Univ, Fac Med, Dept Pediat, Div Neurol, TR-35100 Izmir, Turkey; [Kaymakcalan, Hande] Bahcesehir Univ, Fac Arts & Sci, TR-34353 Istanbul, Turkey; [Sanders, Stephan; State, Matthew W.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Sanders, Stephan; State, Matthew W.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Child Study, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Dincer, Alp] Acibadem Univ, Sch Med, Dept Radiol, TR-34742 Istanbul, Turkey; [Johnson, Michele H.; Bronen, Richard A.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Radiol, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Johnson, Michele H.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Otolaryngol, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Kocer, Naci] Istanbul Univ, Cerrahpasa Fac Med, Dept Radiol, TR-34098 Istanbul, Turkey; [Per, Hueseyin; Kumandas, Sefer] Erciyes Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Div Neurol, TR-38039 Kayseri, Turkey; [Mane, Shrikant] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Yale Ctr Genome Anal, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Pamir, Mehmet Necmettin] Acibadem Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosurg, TR-34742 Istanbul, Turkey; [Yalcinkaya, Cengiz] Istanbul Univ, Cerrahpasa Fac Med, Dept Neurol, Div Child Neurol, TR-34098 Istanbul, Turkey; [Lifton, Richard P.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New Haven, CT 06510 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09327,Article,,richard.lifton@yale.edu; matthew.state@yale.edu; murat.gunel@yale.edu,U93,"Yale Program on Neurogenetics; Yale Center for Human Genetics and Genomics; National Institutes of Health [RC2 NS070477, UL1 RR024139NIH, UO1MH081896]; National Institutes of Health Neuroscience Microarray Consortium [U24 NS051869-02S1]","We are indebted to the patients and families who have contributed to this study.

5,0,40.0,"Daily oscillations of gene expression underlie circadian behaviours in multicellular organisms(1). While attention has been focused on transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms(1-3), other post-transcriptional modes have been less clearly delineated. Here we report mutants of a novel Drosophila gene twenty-four (tyf) that show weak behavioural rhythms. Weak rhythms are accompanied by marked reductions in the levels of the clock protein Period (PER) as well as more modest effects on Timeless (TIM). Nonetheless, PER induction in pacemaker neurons can rescue tyf mutant rhythms. TYF associates with a 5'-cap-binding complex, poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), as well as per and tim transcripts. Furthermore, TYF activates reporter expression when tethered to reporter messenger RNA even in vitro. Taken together, these data indicate that TYF potently activates PER translation in pacemaker neurons to sustain robust rhythms, revealing a new and important role for translational control in the Drosophila circadian clock.","Lim, Chunghun; Lee, Jongbin; Choi, Changtaek; Kilman, Valerie L.; Kim, Juwon; Park, Sung Mi; Jang, Sung Key; Allada, Ravi; Choe, Joonho","Lim, C; Lee, J; Choi, C; Kilman, VL; Kim, J; Park, SM; Jang, SK; Allada, R; Choe, J",399.0,"[Lim, Chunghun; Kilman, Valerie L.; Allada, Ravi] Northwestern Univ, Dept Neurobiol & Physiol, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Lee, Jongbin; Choi, Changtaek; Kim, Juwon; Choe, Joonho] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Biol Sci, Taejon 305701, South Korea; [Park, Sung Mi; Jang, Sung Key] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Life Sci, Pohang 790784, South Korea",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09728,Article,,r-allada@northwestern.edu; jchoe@kaist.ac.kr,U152,"Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, the Republic of Korea; National Institutes of Health [R01NS059042, R01NS052903, R01MH067870]","We thank I.

6,56,107.0,"Classical sexual selection theory(1-4) provides a well-supported conceptual framework for understanding the evolution and signalling function of male ornaments. It predicts that males obtain greater fitness benefits than females through multiple mating because sperm are cheaper to produce than eggs. Sexual selection should therefore lead to the evolution of male-biased secondary sexual characters. However, females of many species are also highly ornamented(5-7). The view that this is due to a correlated genetic response to selection on males(1,8) was widely accepted as an explanation for female ornamentation for over 100 years(5) and current theoretical(9,10) and empirical(11-13) evidence suggests that genetic constraints can limit sex-specific trait evolution. Alternatively, female ornamentation can be the outcome of direct selection for signalling needs(7,14). Since few studies have explored interspecific patterns of both male and female elaboration, our understanding of the evolution of animal ornamentation remains incomplete, especially over broad taxonomic scales. Here we use a new method to quantify plumage colour of all similar to 6,000 species of passerine birds to determine the main evolutionary drivers of ornamental colouration in both sexes. We found that conspecific male and female colour elaboration are strongly correlated, suggesting that evolutionary changes in one sex are constrained by changes in the other sex. Both sexes are more ornamented in larger species and in species living in tropical environments. Ornamentation in females (but not males) is increased in cooperative breeders-species in which female-female competition for reproductive opportunities and other resources related to breeding may be high(6). Finally, strong sexual selection on males has antagonistic effects, causing an increase in male colouration but a considerably more pronounced reduction in female ornamentation. Our results indicate that although there may be genetic constraints to sexually independent colour evolution, both female and male ornamentation are strongly and often differentially related to morphological, social and life-history variables.","Dale, James; Dey, Cody J.; Delhey, Kaspar; Kempenaers, Bart; Valcu, Mihai","Dale, J; Dey, CJ; Delhey, K; Kempenaers, B; Valcu, M",367.0,"[Dale, James] Massey Univ, Inst Nat & Math Sci, Auckland 0745, New Zealand; [Dey, Cody J.] McMaster Univ, Dept Biol, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada; [Delhey, Kaspar] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Delhey, Kaspar] Max Planck Inst Ornithol, D-78315 Radolfzell am Bodensee, Germany; [Kempenaers, Bart; Valcu, Mihai] Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Dept Behav Ecol & Evolutionary Genet, D-82319 Seewiesen, Germany",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15509,Article,1476-4687,j.dale@massey.ac.nz,+,Massey University; Australian and Pacific Science Foundation [APSF 10/8]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Canadian Graduate Scholarship; Australian Research Council [DE120102323]; Max Planck Society,"We thank the many ornithologists and scientists who have published their data or contributed data to public databases, allowing us to conduct this study.

7,90,65.0,"Cervical cancer is responsible for 10-15% of cancer-related deaths in women worldwide(1,2). The aetiological role of infection with high-risk human papilloma viruses (HPVs) in cervical carcinomas is well established(3). Previous studies have also implicated somatic mutations in PIK3CA, PTEN, TP53, STK11 and KRAS(4-7) as well as several copy-number alterations in the pathogenesis of cervical carcinomas(8,9). Here we report whole-exome sequencing analysis of 115 cervical carcinoma-normal paired samples, transcriptome sequencing of 79 cases and whole-genome sequencing of 14 tumour-normal pairs. Previously unknown somatic mutations in 79 primary squamous cell carcinomas include recurrent E322K substitutions in the MAPK1 gene (8%), inactivating mutations in the HLA-B gene (9%), and mutations in EP300 (16%), FBXW7 (15%), NFE2L2 (4%), TP53 (5%) and ERBB2 (6%). We also observe somatic ELF3 (13%) and CBFB (8%) mutations in 24 adenocarcinomas. Squamous cell carcinomas have higher frequencies of somatic nucleotide substitutions occurring at cytosines preceded by thymines (Tp*C sites) than adenocarcinomas. Gene expression levels at HPV integration sites were statistically significantly higher in tumours with HPV integration compared with expression of the same genes in tumours without viral integration at the same site. These data demonstrate several recurrent genomic alterations in cervical carcinomas that suggest new strategies to combat this disease.","Ojesina, Akinyemi I.; Lichtenstein, Lee; Freeman, Samuel S.; Pedamallu, Chandra Sekhar;

8,91,284.0,"The effect of anthropogenic aerosols on cloud droplet concentrations and radiative properties is the source of one of the largest uncertainties in the radiative forcing of climate over the industrial period. This uncertainty affects our ability to estimate how sensitive the climate is to greenhouse gas emissions. Here we perform a sensitivity analysis on a global model to quantify the uncertainty in cloud radiative forcing over the industrial period caused by uncertainties in aerosol emissions and processes. Our results show that 45 per cent of the variance of aerosol forcing since about 1750 arises from uncertainties in natural emissions of volcanic sulphur dioxide, marine dimethylsulphide, biogenic volatile organic carbon, biomass burning and sea spray. Only 34 per cent of the variance is associated with anthropogenic emissions. The results point to the importance of understanding pristine pre-industrial-like environments, with natural aerosols only, and suggest that improved measurements and evaluation of simulated aerosols in polluted present-day conditions will not necessarily result in commensurate reductions in the uncertainty of forcing estimates.","Carslaw, K.

9,110,279.0,"Transcription factors bind in a combinatorial fashion to specify the on-and-off states of genes; the ensemble of these binding events forms a regulatory network, constituting the wiring diagram for a cell. To examine the principles of the human transcriptional regulatory network, we determined the genomic binding information of 119 transcription-related factors in over 450 distinct experiments. We found the combinatorial, co-association of transcription factors to be highly context specific: distinct combinations of factors bind at specific genomic locations. In particular, there are significant differences in the binding proximal and distal to genes. We organized all the transcription factor binding into a hierarchy and integrated it with other genomic information (for example, microRNA regulation), forming a dense meta-network. Factors at different levels have different properties; for instance, top-level transcription factors more strongly influence expression and middle-level ones co-regulate targets to mitigate information-flow bottlenecks. Moreover, these co-regulations give rise to many enriched network motifs (for example, noise-buffering feed-forward loops). Finally, more connected network components are under stronger selection and exhibit a greater degree of allele-specific activity (that is, differential binding to the two parental alleles). The regulatory information obtained in this study will be crucial for interpreting personal genome sequences and understanding basic principles of human biology and disease.","Gerstein, Mark B.; Kundaje, Anshul; Hariharan, Manoj; Landt, Stephen G.; Yan, Koon-Kiu; Cheng, Chao; Mu, Xinmeng Jasmine; Khurana, Ekta; Rozowsky, Joel; Alexander, Roger; Min, Renqiang; Alves, Pedro; Abyzov, Alexej; Addleman, Nick; Bhardwaj, Nitin; Boyle, Alan P.; Cayting, Philip; Charos, Alexandra; Chen, David Z.; Cheng, Yong; Clarke, Declan; Eastman, Catharine; Euskirchen, Ghia; Frietze, Seth; Fu, Yao; Gertz, Jason; Grubert, Fabian; Harmanci, Arif; Jain, Preti; Kasowski, Maya; Lacroute, Phil; Leng, Jing; Lian, Jin; Monahan, Hannah; O'Geen, Henriette; Ouyang, Zhengqing; Partridge, E.

10,37,238.0,"The mass and chemical composition of a star are the primary determinants of its basic physical properties - radius, temperature and luminosity - and how those properties evolve with time(1). Accordingly, two stars born at the same time, from the same natal material and with the same mass, are 'identical twins,' and as such might be expected to possess identical physical attributes. We have discovered in the Orion nebula a pair of stellar twins in a newborn binary star system(2). Each star in the binary has a mass of 0.41 +/- 0.01 solar masses, identical to within 2 per cent. Here we report that these twin stars have surface temperatures differing by similar to 300 K (similar to 10 per cent) and luminosities differing by similar to 50 per cent, both at high confidence level. Preliminary results indicate that the stars' radii also differ, by 5 - 10 per cent. These surprising dissimilarities suggest that one of the twins may have been delayed by several hundred thousand years in its formation relative to its sibling. Such a delay could only have been detected in a very young, definitively equal-mass binary system(3). Our findings reveal cosmic limits on the age synchronization of young binary stars, often used as tests for the age calibrations of star-formation models(4).","Stassun, Keivan G.; Mathieu, Robert D.; Cargile, Phillip A.; Aarnio, Alicia N.; Stempels, Eric; Geller, Aaron","Stassun, KG; Mathieu, RD; Cargile, PA; Aarnio, AN; Stempels, E; Geller, A",1079.0,"[Stassun, Keivan G.; Cargile, Phillip A.; Aarnio, Alicia N.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Mathieu, Robert D.; Geller, Aaron] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Astron, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Stempels, Eric] Univ St Andrews, Sch Phys & Astron, St Andrews KY16 9SS, Fife, Scotland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07069,Article,,keivan.stassun@vanderbilt.edu,1082,,,314WM,,,ORION NEBULA CLUSTER; SEQUENCE ECLIPSING BINARY; LOW-MASS; ABSOLUTE CALIBRATION; FORMING REGION; BROWN DWARFS; SYSTEM; 2MASS; TEMPERATURES; PHOTOMETRY,7198.0,NATURE,Nature,English,29.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",19-Jun,4.0,LONDON,18563159.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,,"Stassun, KG (reprint author), Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,39.0,Surprising dissimilarities in a newly formed pair of 'identical twin' stars,0.0,3.0,WOS:000256839900051,238.0,453,Multidisciplinary Sciences,40,aaron,geller,1008.0,2280,male,1.0,PyNOB1EAAAAJ,1,"[0, 1474]",34068800,1,5923637,1,Laura Geller,Laura Geller,1,1
11,60,284.0,"Genetic studies have consistently indicated a single common origin of Native American groups from Central and South America(1-4). However, some morphological studies have suggested a more complex picture, whereby the northeast Asian affinities of present-day Native Americans contrast with a distinctive morphology seen in some of the earliest American skeletons, which share traits with present-day Australasians (indigenous groups in Australia, Melanesia, and island Southeast Asia)(5-8). Here we analyse genome-wide data to show that some Amazonian Native Americans descend partly from a Native American founding population that carried ancestry more closely related to indigenous Australians, New Guineans and Andaman Islanders than to any present-day Eurasians or Native Americans. This signature is not present to the same extent, or at all, in present-day Northern and Central Americans or in a similar to 12,600-year-old Clovis-associated genome, suggesting a more diverse set of founding populations of the Americas than previously accepted.","Skoglund, Pontus; Mallick, Swapan; Bortolini, Maria Catira; Chennagiri, Niru; Huenemeier, Tabita; Petzl-Erler, Maria Luiza; Salzano, Francisco Mauro; Patterson, Nick; Reich, David","Skoglund, P; Mallick, S; Bortolini, MC; Chennagiri, N; Hunemeier, T; Petzl-Erler, ML; Salzano, FM; Patterson, N; Reich, D",104.0,"[Skoglund, Pontus; Mallick, Swapan; Chennagiri, Niru; Reich, David] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Skoglund, Pontus; Mallick, Swapan; Chennagiri, Niru; Patterson, Nick; Reich, David] Broad Inst Harvard & MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Mallick, Swapan; Reich, David] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Bortolini, Maria Catira; Salzano, Francisco Mauro] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Inst Biociencias, BR-91501970 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Huenemeier, Tabita] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Genet Biol Evolut, BR-05508090 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Petzl-Erler, Maria Luiza] Univ Fed Parana, Dept Genet, BR-81531980 Curitiba, PR, Brazil",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14895,Article,1476-4687,skoglund@genetics.med.harvard.edu; reich@genetics.med.harvard.edu,+,Conselho Nacional do Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (Brazil); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (Brazil); Wenner-Gren foundation; Swedish Research Council (VR) [2014-453]; US National Science Foundation HOMINID [BCS-1032255]; US National Institutes of Health [GM100233]; Simons Foundation [280376]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute,"We are grateful to the Native American volunteers who contributed the DNA samples used to generate the new data reported in this study and to the Fundacao Nacional do Indio (FUNAI, Brazil) for logistical support in sample collection.

12,70,27.0,"The United States is now experiencing the most rapid expansion in oil and gas production in four decades, owing in large part to implementation of new extraction technologies such as horizontal drilling combined with hydraulic fracturing. The environmental impacts of this development, from its effect on water quality(1) to the influence of increased methane leakage on climate(2), have been a matter of intense debate. Air quality impacts are associated with emissions of nitrogen oxides(3,4) (NOx = NO + NO2) and volatile organic compounds(5-7) (VOCs), whose photochemistry leads to production of ozone, a secondary pollutant with negative health effects(8). Recent observations in oil-and gas-producing basins in the western United States have identified ozone mixing ratios well in excess of present air quality standards, but only during winter(9-13). Understanding winter ozone production in these regions is scientifically challenging. It occurs during cold periods of snow cover when meteorological inversions concentrate air pollutants from oil and gas activities, but when solar irradiance and absolute humidity, which are both required to initiate conventional photochemistry essential for ozone production, are at a minimum. Here, using data from a remote location in the oil and gas basin of northeastern Utah and a box model, we provide a quantitative assessment of the photochemistry that leads to these extreme winter ozone pollution events, and identify key factors that control ozone production in this unique environment. We find that ozone production occurs at lower NOx and much larger VOC concentrations than does its summertime urban counterpart, leading to carbonyl (oxygenated VOCs with a C=O moiety) photolysis as a dominant oxidant source. Extreme VOC concentrations optimize the ozone production efficiency of NOx. There is considerable potential for global growth in oil and gas extraction from shale. This analysis could help inform strategies to monitor and mitigate air quality impacts and provide broader insight into the response of winter ozone to primary pollutants.","Edwards, Peter M.; Brown, Steven S.; Roberts, James M.; Ahmadov, Ravan; Banta, Robert M.; deGouw, Joost A.; Dube, William P.; Field, Robert A.; Flynn, James H.; Gilman, Jessica B.; Graus, Martin; Helmig, Detlev; Koss, Abigail; Langford, Andrew O.; Lefer, Barry L.; Lerner, Brian M.; Li, Rui; Li, Shao-Meng; McKeen, Stuart A.; Murphy, Shane M.; Parrish, David D.; Senff, Christoph J.; Soltis, Jeffrey; Stutz, Jochen; Sweeney, Colm; Thompson, Chelsea R.; Trainer, Michael K.; Tsai, Catalina; Veres, Patrick R.; Washenfelder, Rebecca A.; Warneke, Carsten; Wild, Robert J.; Young, Cora J.; Yuan, Bin; Zamora, Robert","Edwards, PM; Brown, SS; Roberts, JM; Ahmadov, R; Banta, RM; deGouw, JA; Dube, WP; Field, RA; Flynn, JH; Gilman, JB; Graus, M; Helmig, D; Koss, A; Langford, AO; Lefer, BL; Lerner, BM; Li, R; Li, SM; McKeen, SA; Murphy, SM; Parrish, DD; Senff, CJ; Soltis, J; Stutz, J; Sweeney, C; Thompson, CR; Trainer, MK; Tsai, C; Veres, PR; Washenfelder, RA; Warneke, C; Wild, RJ; Young, CJ; Yuan, B; Zamora, R",351.0,"[Edwards, Peter M.; Brown, Steven S.; Roberts, James M.; Ahmadov, Ravan; Banta, Robert M.; deGouw, Joost A.; Dube, William P.; Gilman, Jessica B.; Graus, Martin; Koss, Abigail; Langford, Andrew O.; Lerner, Brian M.; Li, Rui; McKeen, Stuart A.; Parrish, David D.; Senff, Christoph J.; Sweeney, Colm; Trainer, Michael K.; Veres, Patrick R.; Washenfelder, Rebecca A.; Warneke, Carsten; Wild, Robert J.; Young, Cora J.; Yuan, Bin; Zamora, Robert] NOAA, Earth Syst Res Lab, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; [Edwards, Peter M.; Ahmadov, Ravan; deGouw, Joost A.; Dube, William P.; Gilman, Jessica B.; Graus, Martin; Koss, Abigail; Lerner, Brian M.; Li, Rui; McKeen, Stuart A.; Senff, Christoph J.; Sweeney, Colm; Veres, Patrick R.; Washenfelder, Rebecca A.; Warneke, Carsten; Wild, Robert J.; Yuan, Bin] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Field, Robert A.; Murphy, Shane M.; Soltis, Jeffrey] Univ Wyoming, Dept Atmospher Sci, Larmie, WY 82070 USA; [Flynn, James H.; Lefer, Barry L.] Univ Houston, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Houston, TX 77204 USA; [Helmig, Detlev; Thompson, Chelsea R.] Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Li, Shao-Meng] Environm Canada, Air Qual Res Div, Toronto, ON M3H 5T4, Canada; [Stutz, Jochen; Tsai, Catalina] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13767,Article,1476-4687,steven.s.brown@noaa.gov,+,"Uintah Impact Mitigation Special Service District (UIMSSD); Bureau of Land Management (BLM); Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); Utah State University; Western Energy Alliance; NOAA's Atmospheric Chemistry, Climate and Carbon Cycle programme; Questar Energy Products; National Science Foundation [1212666, 1215926]","The Uintah Basin Winter Ozone Studies were a joint project led and coordinated by the Utah Department of Environmental Quality (UDEQ) and supported by the Uintah Impact Mitigation Special Service District (UIMSSD), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Utah State University.

13,135,434.0,"M1 protein, a major virulence factor of the leading invasive strain of group A Streptococcus, is sufficient to induce toxic-shock-like vascular leakage and tissue injury. These events are triggered by the formation of a complex between M1 and fibrinogen that, unlike M1 or fibrinogen alone, leads to neutrophil activation. Here we provide a structural explanation for the pathological properties of the complex formed between streptococcal M1 and human fibrinogen. A conformationally dynamic coiled-coil dimer of M1 was found to organize four fibrinogen molecules into a specific cross-like pattern. This pattern supported the construction of a supramolecular network that was required for neutrophil activation but was distinct from a fibrin clot. Disruption of this network into other supramolecular assemblies was not tolerated. These results have bearing on the pathophysiology of streptococcal toxic shock.","Macheboeuf, Pauline; Buffalo, Cosmo; Fu, Chi-yu; Zinkernagel, Annelies S.; Cole, Jason N.; Johnson, John E.; Nizet, Victor; Ghosh, Partho","Macheboeuf, P; Buffalo, C; Fu, CY; Zinkernagel, AS; Cole, JN; Johnson, JE; Nizet, V; Ghosh, P",64.0,"[Macheboeuf, Pauline; Buffalo, Cosmo; Ghosh, Partho] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Chem & Biochem, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Fu, Chi-yu; Johnson, John E.] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Zinkernagel, Annelies S.; Cole, Jason N.; Nizet, Victor] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Pediat, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Cole, Jason N.] Univ Queensland, Sch Chem & Mol Biosci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Nizet, Victor] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Pharm & Pharmaceut Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09967,Article,1476-4687,pghosh@ucsd.edu,68,"NIH [R21 AI071167, T32 GM007240, R01 AI077780, R01 GM54076]; National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia [514639]","We thank the Argonne Photon Source Laboratory GM/CA CAT staff for help with data collection, R.

14,103,416.0,"Progress in imaging and metrology depends on exquisite control over and comprehensive characterization of wave fields. As reflected in its name, coherent diffractive imaging relies on high coherence when reconstructing highly resolved images from diffraction intensities alone without the need for image-forming lenses(1-3). Fully coherent light can be described adequately by a single pure state. Yet partial coherence and imperfect detection often need to be accounted for, requiring statistical optics or the superposition of states(4,5). Furthermore, the dynamics of samples are increasingly the very objectives of experiments(6). Here we provide a general analytic approach to the characterization of diffractive imaging systems that can be described as low-rank mixed states. We use experimental data and simulations to show how the reconstruction technique compensates for and characterizes various sources of decoherence quantitatively. Based on ptychography(7,8), the procedure is closely related to quantum state tomography and is equally applicable to high-resolution microscopy, wave sensing and fluctuation measurements. As a result, some of the most stringent experimental conditions in ptychography can be relaxed, and susceptibility to imaging artefacts is reduced. Furthermore, the method yields high-resolution images of mixed states within the sample, which may include quantum mixtures or fast stationary stochastic processes such as vibrations, switching or steady flows.","Thibault, Pierre; Menzel, Andreas","Thibault, P; Menzel, A",68.0,"[Thibault, Pierre] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Phys, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Menzel, Andreas] Paul Scherrer Inst, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11806,Article,,pierre.thibault@tum.de,71,European Research Council [279753],"We thank M.

15,95,135.0,"Early-life dietary transitions reflect fundamental aspects of primate evolution and are important determinants of health in contemporary human populations(1,2). Weaning is critical to developmental and reproductive rates; early weaning can have detrimental health effects but enables shorter inter-birth intervals, which influences population growth(3). Uncovering early-life dietary history in fossils is hampered by the absence of prospectively validated biomarkers that are not modified during fossilization(4). Here we show that large dietary shifts in early life manifest as compositional variations in dental tissues. Teeth from human children and captive macaques, with prospectively recorded diet histories, demonstrate that barium (Ba) distributions accurately reflect dietary transitions from the introduction of mother's milk through the weaning process. We also document dietary transitions in a Middle Palaeolithic juvenile Neanderthal, which shows a pattern of exclusive breastfeeding for seven months, followed by seven months of supplementation. After this point, Ba levels in enamel returned to baseline prenatal levels, indicating an abrupt cessation of breastfeeding at 1.2 years of age. Integration of Ba spatial distributions and histological mapping of tooth formation enables novel studies of the evolution of human life history, dietary ontogeny in wild primates, and human health investigations through accurate reconstructions of breastfeeding history.","Austin, Christine; Smith, Tanya M.; Bradman, Asa; Hinde, Katie; Joannes-Boyau, Renaud; Bishop, David; Hare, Dominic J.; Doble, Philip; Eskenazi, Brenda; Arora, Manish","Austin, C; Smith, TM; Bradman, A; Hinde, K; Joannes-Boyau, R; Bishop, D; Hare, DJ; Doble, P; Eskenazi, B; Arora, M",216.0,"[Austin, Christine; Arora, Manish] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Prevent Med, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Austin, Christine; Arora, Manish] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Austin, Christine; Arora, Manish] Westmead Hosp, Westmead Millennium Inst, Inst Dent Res, Sydney, NSW 2145, Australia; [Austin, Christine; Arora, Manish] Univ Sydney, Fac Dent, Sydney, NSW 2145, Australia; [Smith, Tanya M.; Hinde, Katie] Harvard Univ, Dept Human Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Bradman, Asa; Eskenazi, Brenda] Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Publ Hlth, Ctr Environm Res & Childrens Hlth, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Hinde, Katie] Calif Natl Primate Res Ctr, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Joannes-Boyau, Renaud] So Cross Univ, Lismore, NSW 2480, Australia; [Bishop, David; Hare, Dominic J.; Doble, Philip] Univ Technol Sydney, Elemental Bioimaging Facil, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Hare, Dominic J.] Univ Melbourne, Florey Inst Neurosci & Mental Hlth, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12169,Article,,marora@hsph.harvard.edu,+,"US Environmental Protection Agency [RD 83171001, RD 82670901]; US National Institutes of Environmental Health Sciences [PO1 ES009605]; NSF [BCS-0921978]; Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology; Australian Research Council [DP120101752, LP100200254]; SCU postdoctoral Fellowship grant; National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences [4R00ES019597-03]; NHMRC [APP1028372]; Agilent Technologies; Kennelec Scientific","L.

16,27,292.0,"Contact inhibition of locomotion was discovered by Abercrombie more than 50 years ago and describes the behaviour of fibroblast cells confronting each other in vitro, where they retract their protrusions and change direction on contact(1,2). Its failure was suggested to contribute to malignant invasion(3-6). However, the molecular basis of contact inhibition of locomotion and whether it also occurs in vivo are still unknown. Here we show that neural crest cells, a highly migratory and multipotent embryonic cell population, whose behaviour has been likened to malignant invasion(6-8), demonstrate contact inhibition of locomotion both in vivo and in vitro, and that this accounts for their directional migration. When two migrating neural crest cells meet, they stop, collapse their protrusions and change direction. In contrast, when a neural crest cell meets another cell type, it fails to display contact inhibition of locomotion; instead, it invades the other tissue, in the same manner as metastatic cancer cells(3,5,9). We show that inhibition of non-canonical Wnt signalling abolishes both contact inhibition of locomotion and the directionality of neural crest migration. Wnt- signalling members localize at the site of cell contact, leading to activation of RhoA in this region. These results provide the first example of contact inhibition of locomotion in vivo, provide an explanation for coherent directional migration of groups of cells and establish a previously unknown role for noncanonical Wnt signalling.","Carmona-Fontaine, Carlos; Matthews, Helen K.; Kuriyama, Sei; Moreno, Mauricio; Dunn, Graham A.; Parsons, Maddy; Stern, Claudio D.; Mayor, Roberto","Carmona-Fontaine, C; Matthews, HK; Kuriyama, S; Moreno, M; Dunn, GA; Parsons, M; Stern, CD; Mayor, R",957.0,"[Carmona-Fontaine, Carlos; Matthews, Helen K.; Kuriyama, Sei; Moreno, Mauricio; Stern, Claudio D.; Mayor, Roberto] UCL, Dept Anat & Dev Biol, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Dunn, Graham A.; Parsons, Maddy] Kings Coll London, Randall Div Cell & Mol Biophys, London SE1 1UL, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07441,Article,,r.mayor@ucl.ac.uk,961,Medical Research Council; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council; MRC; Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds,"We thank M.

17,25,261.0,"Many organisms can enter a dormant state or diapause to survive harsh environmental conditions for extended durations. When Caenorhabditis elegans larvae enter dauer they arrest feeding but remain active and motile, yet become stress- resistant, extremely long- lived and non- ageing(1). Entry into dauer is associated with a reduction in insulin- like signalling, the accumulation of nutritive resources and a concomitant global change in metabolism(2-5), yet the precise molecular and physiological processes that enable long- term survival in the absence of caloric intake remain largely unknown. We show here that C. elegans larvae that lack LKB1/ AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) signalling enter dauer normally, but then rapidly consume their stored energy and prematurely expire following vital organ failure. We found that this signalling pathway acts in adipose- like tissues to downregulate triglyceride hydrolysis so that these lipid reserves are rationed to last the entire duration of the arrest. Indeed, the downregulation of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL-1) activity suppresses both the rapid depletion of stored lipids and reduced life span of AMPK mutant dauers, while AMPK directly phosphorylates ATGL-1. Finally, we show that the slow release of energy during dauer is critical for appropriate long- term osmoregulation, which fails as triglyceride resources become depleted. These mechanisms may be essential for survival through diapause, hibernation, or long- term fasting in diverse organisms and may also underlie AMPK- dependent life span extension.","Narbonne, Patrick; Roy, Richard","Narbonne, P; Roy, R",210.0,"[Narbonne, Patrick; Roy, Richard] McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07536,Article,,richard.roy@mcgill.ca,U108,Canadian Cancer Society; Canadian Institutes of Health Research,"We thank A.

18,76,149.0,"The transcriptome is the readout of the genome. Identifying common features in it across distant species can reveal fundamental principles. To this end, the ENCODE and modENCODE consortia have generated large amounts of matched RNA-sequencing data for human, worm and fly. Uniform processing and comprehensive annotation of these data allow comparison across metazoan phyla, extending beyond earlier within-phylum transcriptome comparisons and revealing ancient, conserved features(1-6). Specifically, we discover co-expression modules shared across animals, many of which are enriched in developmental genes. Moreover, we use expression patterns to align the stages in worm and fly development and find a novel pairing between worm embryo and fly pupae, in addition to the embryo-to-embryo and larvae-to-larvae pairings. Furthermore, we find that the extent of non-canonical, non-coding transcription is similar in each organism, per base pair. Finally, we find in all three organisms that the gene-expression levels, both coding and non-coding, can be quantitatively predicted from chromatin features at the promoter using a 'universal model' based on a single set of organism-independent parameters.","Gerstein, Mark B.; Rozowsky, Joel; Yan, Koon-Kiu; Wang, Daifeng; Cheng, Chao; Brown, James B.; Davis, Carrie A.; Hillier, LaDeana; Sisu, Cristina; Li, Jingyi Jessica; Pei, Baikang; Harmanci, Arif O.; Duff, Michael O.; Djebali, Sarah; Alexander, Roger P.; Alver, Burak H.; Auerbach, Raymond; Bell, Kimberly; Bickel, Peter J.; Boeck, Max E.; Boley, Nathan P.; Booth, Benjamin W.; Cherbas, Lucy; Cherbas, Peter; Di, Chao; Dobins, Alex; Drenkows, Jorg; Ewing, Brent; Fang, Gang; Fastucas, Megan; Feingold, Elise A.; Frankish, Adam; Gao, Guanjun; Good, Peter J.; Guigo, Roderic; Hammonds, Ann; Harrow, Jen; Hoskins, Roger A.; Howald, Cedric; Hu, Long; Huang, Haiyan; Hubbard, Tim J.

19,87,435.0,"The geochemistry of Martian meteorites provides a wealth of information about the solid planet and the surface and atmospheric processes that occurred on Mars. The degree to which Martian magmas may have assimilated crustal material, thus altering the geochemical signatures acquired from their mantle sources, is unclear(1). This issue features prominently in efforts to understand whether the source of light rare-earth elements in enriched shergottites lies in crustal material incorporated into melts(1,2) or in mixing between enriched and depleted mantle reservoirs(3). Sulphur isotope systematics offer insight into some aspects of crustal assimilation. The presence of igneous sulphides in Martian meteorites with sulphur isotope signatures indicative of mass-independent fractionation suggests the assimilation of sulphur both during passage of magmas through the crust of Mars and at sites of emplacement. Here we report isotopic analyses of 40 Martian meteorites that represent more than half of the distinct known Martian meteorites, including 30 shergottites (28 plus 2 pairs, where pairs are separate fragments of a single meteorite), 8 nakhlites (5 plus 3 pairs), Allan Hills 84001 and Chassigny. Our data provide strong evidence that assimilation of sulphur into Martian magmas was a common occurrence throughout much of the planet's history. The signature of mass-independent fractionation observed also indicates that the atmospheric imprint of photochemical processing preserved in Martian meteoritic sulphide and sulphate is distinct from that observed in terrestrial analogues, suggesting fundamental differences between the dominant sulphur chemistry in the atmosphere of Mars and that in the atmosphere of Earth(4).","Franz, Heather B.; Kim, Sang-Tae; Farquhar, James; Day, James M.

20,111,290.0,"Adult neurogenesis arises from neural stem cells within specialized niches(1-3). Neuronal activity and experience, presumably acting on this local niche, regulate multiple stages of adult neurogenesis, from neural progenitor proliferation to new neuron maturation, synaptic integration and survival(1,3). It is unknown whether local neuronal circuitry has a direct impact on adult neural stem cells. Here we show that, in the adult mouse hippocampus, nestin-expressing radial glia-like quiescent neural stem cells(4-9) (RGLs) respond tonically to the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) by means of gamma(2)-subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors. Clonal analysis(9) of individual RGLs revealed a rapid exit from quiescence and enhanced symmetrical self-renewal after conditional deletion of gamma(2). RGLs are in close proximity to terminals expressing 67-kDa glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD67) of parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons and respond tonically to GABA released from these neurons. Functionally, optogenetic control of the activity of dentate PV+ interneurons, but not that of somatostatin-expressing or vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons, can dictate the RGL choice between quiescence and activation. Furthermore, PV+ interneuron activation restores RGL quiescence after social isolation, an experience that induces RGL activation and symmetrical division(8). Our study identifies a niche cell-signal-receptor trio and a local circuitry mechanism that control the activation and self-renewal mode of quiescent adult neural stem cells in response to neuronal activity and experience.","Song, Juan; Zhong, Chun; Bonaguidi, Michael A.; Sun, Gerald J.; Hsu, Derek; Gu, Yan; Meletis, Konstantinos; Huang, Z.

21,109,258.0,"Epigenetic information is frequently erased near the start of each new generation(1). In some cases, however, epigenetic information can be transmitted from parent to progeny (multigenerational epigenetic inheritance)(2). A particularly notable example of this type of epigenetic inheritance is double-stranded RNA-mediated gene silencing in Caenorhabditis elegans. This RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) can be inherited for more than five generations(3-8). To understand this process, here we conduct a genetic screen for nematodes defective in transmitting RNAi silencing signals to future generations. This screen identified the heritable RNAi defective 1 (hrde-1) gene. hrde-1 encodes an Argonaute protein that associates with small interfering RNAs in the germ cells of progeny of animals exposed to double-stranded RNA. In the nuclei of these germ cells, HRDE-1 engages the nuclear RNAi defective pathway to direct the trimethylation of histone H3 at Lys 9 (H3K9me3) at RNAi-targeted genomic loci and promote RNAi inheritance. Under normal growth conditions, HRDE-1 associates with endogenously expressed short interfering RNAs, which direct nuclear gene silencing in germ cells. In hrde-1- or nuclear RNAi-deficient animals, germline silencing is lost over generational time. Concurrently, these animals exhibit steadily worsening defects in gamete formation and function that ultimately lead to sterility. These results establish that the Argonaute protein HRDE-1 directs gene-silencing events in germ-cell nuclei that drive multigenerational RNAi inheritance and promote immortality of the germ-cell lineage. We propose that C. elegans use the RNAi inheritance machinery to transmit epigenetic information, accrued by past generations, into future generations to regulate important biological processes.","Buckley, Bethany A.; Burkhart, Kirk B.; Gu, Sam Guoping; Spracklin, George; Kershner, Aaron; Fritz, Heidi; Kimble, Judith; Fire, Andrew; Kennedy, Scott","Buckley, BA; Burkhart, KB; Gu, SG; Spracklin, G; Kershner, A; Fritz, H; Kimble, J; Fire, A; Kennedy, S",447.0,"[Buckley, Bethany A.; Burkhart, Kirk B.; Spracklin, George; Fritz, Heidi; Kimble, Judith; Kennedy, Scott] Univ Wisconsin, Lab Genet, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Gu, Sam Guoping; Fire, Andrew] Stanford Univ, Dept Pathol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Gu, Sam Guoping; Fire, Andrew] Stanford Univ, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kershner, Aaron; Fritz, Heidi] Univ Wisconsin, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Kershner, Aaron; Kimble, Judith] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biochem, Madison, WI 53706 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11352,Article,,sgkennedy@wisc.edu,451,"Pew scholar's program; Shaw scholar's program; National Institutes of Health [GM88289, GM37706, GM069454]","We thank P.

22,125,345.0,"Despite tremendous efforts, development of an effective vaccine against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has proved an elusive goal. Recently, however, numerous antibodies have been identified that are capable of neutralizing most circulating HIV strains(1-5). These antibodies all exhibit an unusually high level of somatic mutation(6), presumably owing to extensive affinity maturation over the course of continuous exposure to an evolving antigen(7). Although substantial effort has focused on the design of immunogens capable of eliciting antibodies de novo that would target similar epitopes(8-10), it remains uncertain whether a conventional vaccine will be able to elicit analogues of the existing broadly neutralizing antibodies. As an alternative to immunization, vector-mediated gene transfer could be used to engineer secretion of the existing broadly neutralizing antibodies into the circulation. Here we describe a practical implementation of this approach, which we call vectored immunoprophylaxis (VIP), which in mice induces lifelong expression of these monoclonal antibodies at high concentrations from a single intramuscular injection. This is achieved using a specialized adeno-associated virus vector optimized for the production of full-length antibody from muscle tissue. We show that humanized mice receiving VIP appear to be fully protected from HIV infection, even when challenged intravenously with very high doses of replication-competent virus. Our results suggest that successful translation of this approach to humans may produce effective prophylaxis against HIV.","Balazs, Alejandro B.; Chen, Joyce; Hong, Christin M.; Rao, Dinesh S.; Yang, Lili; Baltimore, David","Balazs, AB; Chen, J; Hong, CM; Rao, DS; Yang, LL; Baltimore, D",81.0,"[Balazs, Alejandro B.; Chen, Joyce; Hong, Christin M.; Yang, Lili; Baltimore, David] CALTECH, Div Biol, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Rao, Dinesh S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10660,Article,,baltimo@caltech.edu,U88,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation through Grand Challenges in Global Health Initiative [37866]; National Institutes of Health through the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) [HHSN266200500035C]; Joint Center for Translational Medicine; amfAR [107756-47-RFVA]; National Institutes of Health [1K08CA133521],"We thank J.

23,119,34.0,"Opium is one of the world's oldest drugs, and its derivatives morphine and codeine are among the most used clinical drugs to relieve severe pain. These prototypical opioids produce analgesia as well as many undesirable side effects (sedation, apnoea and dependence) by binding to and activating the G-protein-coupled mu-opioid receptor (mu-OR) in the central nervous system. Here we describe the 2.8 angstrom crystal structure of the mouse mu-OR in complex with an irreversible morphinan antagonist. Compared to the buried binding pocket observed in most G-protein-coupled receptors published so far, the morphinan ligand binds deeply within a large solvent-exposed pocket. Of particular interest, the mu-OR crystallizes as a two-fold symmetrical dimer through a four-helix bundle motif formed by transmembrane segments 5 and 6. These high-resolution insights into opioid receptor structure will enable the application of structure-based approaches to develop better drugs for the management of pain and addiction.","Manglik, Aashish; Kruse, Andrew C.; Kobilka, Tong Sun; Thian, Foon Sun; Mathiesen, Jesper M.; Sunahara, Roger K.; Pardo, Leonardo; Weis, William I.; Kobilka, Brian K.; Granier, Sebastien","Manglik, A; Kruse, AC; Kobilka, TS; Thian, FS; Mathiesen, JM; Sunahara, RK; Pardo, L; Weis, WI; Kobilka, BK; Granier, S",321.0,"[Manglik, Aashish; Kruse, Andrew C.; Kobilka, Tong Sun; Thian, Foon Sun; Mathiesen, Jesper M.; Weis, William I.; Kobilka, Brian K.; Granier, Sebastien] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Physiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Sunahara, Roger K.] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Pardo, Leonardo] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Unit Bioestat, Lab Med Computac, Barcelona 08193, Spain; [Weis, William I.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Struct, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Granier, Sebastien] CNRS, INSERM, U661, UMR 5203, F-34094 Montpellier, France; [Granier, Sebastien] Univ Montpellier 1 & 2, Inst Genom Fonctionnelle, F-34094 Montpellier, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10954,Article,,kobilka@stanford.edu; granier@stanford.edu,U170,"INSERM; Stanford Medical Scientist Training Program; National Science Foundation; Lundbeck Foundation; National Institutes of Health [NS028471, DA031418]; Mathers Foundation","We acknowledge support from INSERM (S.

24,65,347.0,"Only three elements are ferromagnetic at room temperature: the transition metals iron, cobalt and nickel. The Stoner criterion explains why iron is ferromagnetic but manganese, for example, is not, even though both elements have an unfilled 3d shell and are adjacent in the periodic table: according to this criterion, the product of the density of states and the exchange integral must be greater than unity for spontaneous spin ordering to emerge(1,2). Here we demonstrate that it is possible to alter the electronic states of non-ferromagnetic materials, such as diamagnetic copper and paramagnetic manganese, to overcome the Stoner criterion and make them ferromagnetic at room temperature. This effect is achieved via interfaces between metallic thin films and C-60 molecular layers. The emergent ferromagnetic state exists over several layers of the metal before being quenched at large sample thicknesses by the material's bulk properties. Although the induced magnetization is easily measurable by magnetometry, low-energy muon spin spectroscopy(3) provides insight into its distribution by studying the depolarization process of low-energy muons implanted in the sample. This technique indicates localized spin-ordered states at, and close to, the metal-molecule interface. Density functional theory simulations suggest a mechanism based on magnetic hardening of the metal atoms, owing to electron transfer(4,5). This mechanism might allow for the exploitation of molecular coupling to design magnetic metamaterials using abundant, non-toxic components such as organic semiconductors. Charge transfer at molecular interfaces may thus be used to control spin polarization or magnetization, with consequences for the design of devices for electronic, power or computing applications (see, for example, refs 6 and 7).","Al Ma'Mari, Fatma; Moorsom, Timothy; Teobaldi, Gilberto; Deacon, William; Prokscha, Thomas; Luetkens, Hubertus; Lee, Steve; Sterbinsky, George E.; Arena, Dario A.; MacLaren, Donald A.; Flokstra, Machiel; Ali, Mannan; Wheeler, May C.; Burnell, Gavin; Hickey, Bryan J.; Cespedes, Oscar","Al Ma'Mari, F; Moorsom, T; Teobaldi, G; Deacon, W; Prokscha, T; Luetkens, H; Lee, S; Sterbinsky, GE; Arena, DA; MacLaren, DA; Flokstra, M; Ali, M; Wheeler, MC; Burnell, G; Hickey, BJ; Cespedes, O",69.0,"[Al Ma'Mari, Fatma; Moorsom, Timothy; Deacon, William; Ali, Mannan; Wheeler, May C.; Burnell, Gavin; Hickey, Bryan J.; Cespedes, Oscar] Univ Leeds, Sch Phys & Astron, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Teobaldi, Gilberto] Univ Liverpool, Stephenson Inst Renewable Energy, Dept Chem, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England; [Prokscha, Thomas; Luetkens, Hubertus] Paul Scherrer Inst, Lab Muon Spin Spect, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland; [Lee, Steve; Flokstra, Machiel] Univ St Andrews, Sch Phys & Astron, SUPA, St Andrews KY16 9SS, Fife, Scotland; [Sterbinsky, George E.; Arena, Dario A.] Brookhaven Natl Lab, Photon Sci Directorate, Upton, NY 11973 USA; [MacLaren, Donald A.] Univ Glasgow, Sch Phys & Astron, SUPA, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14621,Article,1476-4687,o.cespedes@leeds.ac.uk,U128,"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/K00512X/1, EP/K036408/1, EP/J01060X/1, EP/I004483/1]; US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-AC02-98CH10886]","This work was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council through grants EP/K00512X/1, EP/K036408/1, EP/J01060X/1 and EP/I004483/1.

25,86,406.0,"Tropical forests are global epicentres of biodiversity and important modulators of climate change(1), and are mainly constrained by rainfall patterns(1-3). The severe short-term droughts that occurred recently in Amazonia have drawn attention to the vulnerability of tropical forests to climatic disturbances(4-9). The central African rainforests, the second-largest on Earth, have experienced a long-term drying trend(10,11) whose impacts on vegetation dynamics remain mostly unknown because in situ observations are very limited. The Congolese forest, with its drier conditions and higher percentage of semi-evergreen trees(12,13), may be more tolerant to short-term rainfall reduction than are wetter tropical forests(11), but for a long-term drought there may be critical thresholds of water availability below which higher-biomass, closed-canopy forests transition to more open, lower-biomass forests(1,2,14). Here we present observational evidence for a widespread decline in forest greenness over the past decade based on analyses of satellite data (optical, thermal, microwave and gravity) from several independent sensors over the Congo basin. This decline in vegetation greenness, particularly in the northern Congolese forest, is generally consistent with decreases in rainfall, terrestrial water storage, water content in aboveground woody and leaf biomass, and the canopy backscatter anomaly caused by changes in structure and moisture in upper forest layers. It is also consistent with increases in photosynthetically active radiation and land surface temperature. These multiple lines of evidence indicate that this large-scale vegetation browning, or loss of photosynthetic capacity, may be partially attributable to the long-term drying trend. Our results suggest that a continued gradual decline of photosynthetic capacity and moisture content driven by the persistent drying trend could alter the composition and structure of the Congolese forest to favour the spread of drought-tolerant species(1,2,14).","Zhou, Liming; Tian, Yuhong; Myneni, Ranga B.; Ciais, Philippe; Saatchi, Sassan; Liu, Yi Y.; Piao, Shilong; Chen, Haishan; Vermote, Eric F.; Song, Conghe; Hwang, Taehee","Zhou, LM; Tian, YH; Myneni, RB; Ciais, P; Saatchi, S; Liu, YY; Piao, SL; Chen, HS; Vermote, EF; Song, CH; Hwang, TH",86.0,"[Zhou, Liming] SUNY Albany, Dept Atmospher & Environm Sci, Albany, NY 12222 USA; [Tian, Yuhong] NOAA, IMSG, NESDIS, Ctr Satellite Applicat & Res,STAR, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Myneni, Ranga B.] Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Ciais, Philippe] UVSQ, CEA, CNRS, LSCE, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Saatchi, Sassan] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA; [Liu, Yi Y.] Univ New S Wales, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Syst Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Liu, Yi Y.] Univ New S Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Piao, Shilong] Peking Univ, Dept Ecol, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Chen, Haishan] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Minist Educ, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Vermote, Eric F.] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Song, Conghe] Univ N Carolina, Dept Geog, Chapel Hill, NC 29599 USA; [Song, Conghe] Anhui Agr Univ, Sch Forestry & Landscape Architecture, Hefei 230036, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Hwang, Taehee] Univ N Carolina, Inst Environm, Chapel Hill, NC 29599 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13265,Article,1476-4687,lzhou@albany.edu,+,"NOAA NESDIS [NA11NES4400010]; University at Albany, State University of New York; NASA's Earth Science Division; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41230422]","This study was supported by the NOAA NESDIS project (NA11NES4400010) and by the startup funds provided by the University at Albany, State University of New York.

26,68,456.0,"Theropod dinosaurs were the dominant predators inmost Mesozoic era terrestrial ecosystems(1). Early theropod evolution is currently interpreted as the diversification of various carnivorous and cursorial taxa, whereas the acquisition of herbivorism, together with the secondary loss of cursorial adaptations, occurred much later among advanced coelurosaurian theropods(1,2). A new, bizarre herbivorous basal tetanuran from the Upper Jurassic of Chile challenges this conception. The new dinosaur was discovered at Aysen, a fossil locality in the Upper Jurassic Toqui Formation of southern Chile (General Carrera Lake)(3,4). The site yielded abundant and exquisitely preserved three-dimensional skeletons of small archosaurs. Several articulated individuals of Chilesaurus at different ontogenetic stages have been collected, as well as less abundant basal crocodyliforms, and fragmentary remains of sauropod dinosaurs (diplodocids and titanosaurians).","Novas, Fernando E.; Salgado, Leonardo; Suarez, Manuel; Agnolin, Federico L.; Ezcurra, Martin D.; Chimento, Nicolas R.; de la Cruz, Rita; Isasi, Marcelo P.; Vargas, Alexander O.; Rubilar-Rogers, David","Novas, FE; Salgado, L; Suarez, M; Agnolin, FL; Ezcurra, MD; Chimento, NR; de la Cruz, R; Isasi, MP; Vargas, AO; Rubilar-Rogers, D",331.0,"[Novas, Fernando E.; Salgado, Leonardo; Isasi, Marcelo P.] Museo Argentino Ciencias Nat Bernardino Rivadavia, CONICET, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Novas, Fernando E.; Agnolin, Federico L.; Chimento, Nicolas R.; Isasi, Marcelo P.] Museo Argentino Ciencias Nat Bernardino Rivadavia, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Salgado, Leonardo] Univ Nacl Rio Negro, Inst Invest Paleobiol & Geol, CONICET, RA-8332 Gen Roca, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Salgado, Leonardo] Univ Nacl Rio Negro, Inst Invest Paleobiol & Geol, RA-8332 Gen Roca, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Suarez, Manuel] Univ Andres Bello, Geol, Fac Ingn, Santiago, Chile; [Suarez, Manuel] Univ Maimonides, Fdn Hist Nat Felix de Azara, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Ezcurra, Martin D.] Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [de la Cruz, Rita] Serv Nacl Geol & Mineria, Santiago 8330177, Chile; [Vargas, Alexander O.; Rubilar-Rogers, David] Univ Chile, Dept Biol, Lab Ontogenia & Filogenia, Red Paleontol U Chile, Santiago 7800003, Chile; [Rubilar-Rogers, David] Museo Nacl Hist Nat Chile, Area Paleontol, Santiago, Chile",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14307,Article,1476-4687,fernovas@yahoo.com.ar,+,"Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica [PICT 2010-066]; Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico [1121140, 1030162]","We thank P.

27,74,94.0,"Stresses acting on cold, thick and negatively buoyant oceanic lithosphere are thought to be crucial to the initiation of subduction and the operation of plate tectonics(1,2), which characterizes the present-day geodynamics of the Earth. Because the Earth's interior was hotter in the Archaean eon, the oceanic crust may have been thicker, thereby making the oceanic lithosphere more buoyant than at present(3), and whether subduction and plate tectonics occurred during this time is ambiguous, both in the geological record and in geodynamic models(4). Here we show that because the oceanic crust was thick and buoyant(5), early continents may have produced intra-lithospheric gravitational stresses large enough to drive their gravitational spreading, to initiate subduction at their margins and to trigger episodes of subduction. Our model predicts the co-occurrence of deep to progressively shallower mafic volcanics and arc magmatism within continents in a self-consistent geodynamic framework, explaining the enigmatic multimodal volcanism and tectonic record of Archaean cratons(6). Moreover, our model predicts a petrological stratification and tectonic structure of the sub-continental lithospheric mantle, two predictions that are consistent with xenolith(5) and seismic studies, respectively, and consistent with the existence of amid-lithospheric seismic discontinuity(7). The slow gravitational collapse of early continents could have kick-started transient episodes of plate tectonics until, as the Earth's interior cooled and oceanic lithosphere became heavier, plate tectonics became self-sustaining.","Rey, Patrice F.; Coltice, Nicolas; Flament, Nicolas","Rey, PF; Coltice, N; Flament, N",405.0,"[Rey, Patrice F.; Flament, Nicolas] Univ Sydney, Earthbyte Res Grp, Sch Geosci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Coltice, Nicolas] Univ Lyon 1, Ecole Normale Super Lyon, UMR CNRS 5276, Lab Geol Lyon, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France; [Coltice, Nicolas] Inst Univ France, F-75005 Paris, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13728,Article,1476-4687,patrice.rey@sydney.edu.au,+,Australian Government; Institut Universitaire de France; European Research Council (ERC) [617588]; Statoil ASA,"We thank W.

Zonal flow formation in nuclear fusion devices is also well studied(2). A common feature of these zonal flows is that they are spontaneously generated in turbulent systems. Because the Earth's outer core is believed to be in a turbulent state, it is possible that there is zonal flow in the liquid iron of the outer core. Here we report an investigation at the current low-viscosity limit of numerical simulations of the geodynamo. We find a previously unknown convection regime of the outer core that has a dual structure comprising inner, sheet-like radial plumes and an outer, westward cylindrical zonal flow. We numerically confirm that the dual-convection structure with such a zonal flow is stable under a strong, self-generated dipole magnetic field.","Miyagoshi, Takehiro; Kageyama, Akira; Sato, Tetsuya","Miyagoshi, T; Kageyama, A; Sato, T",793.0,"[Kageyama, Akira] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan; [Miyagoshi, Takehiro] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan; [Sato, Tetsuya] Univ Hyogo, Kobe, Hyogo 6500044, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08754,Article,,kage@cs.kobe-u.ac.jp,U102,KAKENHI [17540404]; Mitsubishi Foundation,This work was supported by KAKENHI (17540404) and The Mitsubishi Foundation.,553VG,,,ROTATING SPHERICAL-SHELL; GEODYNAMO SIMULATIONS; DEEP CONVECTION; RAYLEIGH NUMBER; DRIVEN; EQUATIONS; PLANETS; DYNAMOS; FIELD; MODEL,7282.0,NATURE,Nature,English,26.0,No,"Kageyama, Akira/0000-0003-0433-668X","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",11-Feb,5.0,LONDON,20148036.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2010.0,"Kageyama, Akira/H-4537-2013","Kageyama, A (reprint author), Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,36.0,Zonal flow formation in the Earth's core,0.0,19.0,WOS:000274394300036,389.0,463,Multidisciplinary Sciences,36,tetsuya,sato,456.0,16,male,1.0,bpM4ZKkAAAAJ,1,"[0, 1474]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
29,84,338.0,"The evolution of serially arranged, jointed endoskeletal supports internal to the gills-the visceral branchial arches-represents one of the key events in early jawed vertebrate (gnathostome) history, because it provided the morphological basis for the subsequent evolution of jaws. However, until now little was known about visceral arches in early gnathostomes, and theories about gill arch evolution were driven by information gleaned mostly from both modern cartilaginous (chondrichthyan) and bony (osteichthyan) fishes. New fossil discoveries can profoundly affect our understanding of evolutionary history, by revealing hitherto unseen combinations of primitive and derived characters. Here we describe a 325 million year (Myr)-old Palaeozoic shark-like fossil that represents, to our knowledge, the earliest identified chondrichthyan in which the complete gill skeleton is three-dimensionally preserved in its natural position. Its visceral arch arrangement is remarkably osteichthyan-like, suggesting that this may represent the common ancestral condition for crown gnathostomes. Our findings thus reinterpret the polarity of some arch features of the crown jawed vertebrates and invert the classic hypothesis, in which modern sharks retain the ancestral condition. This study underscores the importance of early chondrichthyans in resolving the evolutionary history of jawed vertebrates.","Pradel, Alan; Maisey, John G.; Tafforeau, Paul; Mapes, Royal H.; Mallatt, Jon","Pradel, A; Maisey, JG; Tafforeau, P; Mapes, RH; Mallatt, J",608.0,"[Pradel, Alan; Maisey, John G.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Dept Vertebrate Paleontol, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Tafforeau, Paul] European Synchrotron Radiat Facil, F-38043 Grenoble, France; [Mapes, Royal H.] Ohio Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Athens, OH 45701 USA; [Mallatt, Jon] Washington State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13195,Article,1476-4687,apradel@amnh.org; maisey@amnh.org,+,H.

30,134,377.0,"Uniform lithospheric extension(1) predicts basic properties of nonvolcanic rifted margins but fails to explain other important characteristics(2,3). Significant discrepancies are observed at 'type I' margins (such as the Iberia-Newfoundland conjugates), where large tracts of continental mantle lithosphere are exposed at the sea floor(4), and 'type II' margins (such as some ultrawide central South Atlantic margins), where thin continental crust spans wide regions below which continental lower crust and mantle lithosphere have apparently been removed(5,6). Neither corresponds to uniform extension. Instead, either crust or mantle lithosphere has been preferentially removed. Using dynamical models, we demonstrate that these margins are opposite end members: in type I, depth-dependent extension results in crustal-necking breakup before mantle-lithosphere breakup and in type II, the converse is true. These two-layer, two-stage breakup behaviours explain the discrepancies and have implications for the styles of the associated sedimentary basins. Laterally flowing lower-mantle cratonic lithosphere may underplate some type II margins, thereby contributing to their anomalous characteristics.","Huismans, Ritske; Beaumont, Christopher","Huismans, R; Beaumont, C",74.0,"[Huismans, Ritske] Univ Bergen, Dept Earth Sci, N-5007 Bergen, Norway; [Beaumont, Christopher] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Oceanog, Halifax, NS B3H 4J1, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09988,Article,,ritske.huismans@geo.uib.no,U85,"Department of Earth Science, University of Bergen, Norway; Canada Research Chair in Geodynamics","R.H. acknowledges support of the Department of Earth Science, University of Bergen, Norway.

31,91,270.0,"In female mice, two forms of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) ensure the selective silencing of female sex chromosomes during mouse embryogenesis. Beginning at the four-cell stage, imprinted XCI (iXCI) exclusively silences the paternal X chromosome. Later, around implantation, epiblast cells of the inner cell mass that give rise to the embryo reactivate the paternal X chromosome and undergo a random form of XCI (rXCI)(1,2). Xist, a long non-coding RNA crucial for both forms of XCI, is activated by the ubiquitin ligase RLIM (also known as Rnf12)(3-5). Although RLIM is required for triggering iXCI in mice, its importance for rXCI has been controversial. Here we show that RLIM levels are downregulated in embryonic cells undergoing rXCI. Using mouse genetics we demonstrate that female cells lacking RLIM from pre-implantation stages onwards show hallmarks of XCI, including Xist clouds and H3K27me3 foci, and have full embryogenic potential. These results provide evidence that RLIM is dispensable for rXCI, indicating that in mice an RLIM-independent mechanism activates Xist in the embryo proper.","Shin, JongDae; Wallingford, Mary C.; Gallant, Judith; Marcho, Chelsea; Jiao, Baowei; Byron, Meg; Bossenz, Michael; Lawrence, Jeanne B.; Jones, Stephen N.; Mager, Jesse; Bach, Ingolf","Shin, J; Wallingford, MC; Gallant, J; Marcho, C; Jiao, BW; Byron, M; Bossenz, M; Lawrence, JB; Jones, SN; Mager, J; Bach, I",86.0,"[Shin, JongDae; Jiao, Baowei; Bach, Ingolf] UMMS, Program Gene Funct & Express, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Wallingford, Mary C.; Marcho, Chelsea; Mager, Jesse] Univ Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Gallant, Judith; Byron, Meg; Lawrence, Jeanne B.; Jones, Stephen N.] UMMS, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Bossenz, Michael] Ortenau Klinikum Lahr Ettenheim, Inst Pathol, D-77933 Lahr, Germany; [Bach, Ingolf] UMMS, Program Mol Med, Worcester, MA 01605 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13286,Article,1476-4687,Ingolf.bach@umassmed.edu,U443,"National Institutes of Health grants [CA131158, CA077735, GM053234]","We are grateful to H.

32,46,332.0,"Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations were significantly lower during glacial periods than during intervening interglacial periods, but the mechanisms responsible for this difference remain uncertain. Many recent explanations call on greater carbon storage in a poorly ventilated deep ocean during glacial periods(1-5), but direct evidence regarding the ventilation and respired carbon content of the glacial deep ocean is sparse and often equivocal(6). Here we present sedimentary geochemical records from sites spanning the deep subarctic Pacific that-together with previously published results(7)-show that a poorly ventilated water mass containing a high concentration of respired carbon dioxide occupied the North Pacific abyss during the Last Glacial Maximum. Despite an inferred increase in deep Southern Ocean ventilation during the first step of the deglaciation (18,000-15,000 years ago)(4,8), we find no evidence for improved ventilation in the abyssal subarctic Pacific until a rapid transition similar to 14,600 years ago: this change was accompanied by an acceleration of export production from the surface waters above but only a small increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration(8). We speculate that these changes were mechanistically linked to a roughly coeval increase in deep water formation in the North Atlantic(9-11), which flushed respired carbon dioxide from northern abyssal waters, but also increased the supply of nutrients to the upper ocean, leading to greater carbon dioxide sequestration at mid-depths and stalling the rise of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. Our findings are qualitatively consistent with hypotheses invoking a deglacial flushing of respired carbon dioxide from an isolated, deep ocean reservoir(1-5,12), but suggest that the reservoir may have been released in stages, as vigorous deep water ventilation switched between North Atlantic and Southern Ocean source regions.","Galbraith, Eric D.; Jaccard, Samuel L.; Pedersen, Thomas F.; Sigman, Daniel M.; Haug, Gerald H.; Cook, Mea; Southon, John R.; Francois, Roger","Galbraith, ED; Jaccard, SL; Pedersen, TF; Sigman, DM; Haug, GH; Cook, M; Southon, JR; Francois, R",890.0,"Univ British Columbia, Dept Earth & Ocean Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; Univ Victoria, Sch Earth & Ocean Sci, Victoria, BC V8W 3P6, Canada; Princeton Univ, Dept Geosci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; ETH, Inst Geol, Dept Earth Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ocean Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06227,Article,,egalbrai@princeton.edu,U9,,,221LY,,,ATMOSPHERIC CO2 CONCENTRATIONS; SANTA-BARBARA BASIN; DEEP-WATER; AGE CALIBRATION; RADIOCARBON AGE; SOUTHERN-OCEAN; GLACIAL PERIOD; PRODUCTIVITY; CIRCULATION; VENTILATION,7164.0,NATURE,Nature,English,39.0,No,"Sigman, Daniel/0000-0002-7923-1973; Galbraith, Eric/0000-0003-4476-4232; Jaccard, Samuel/0000-0002-5793-0896","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",18-Oct,5.0,LONDON,17943127.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007.0,"Sigman, Daniel/A-2649-2008; Galbraith, Eric/F-9469-2014; Jaccard, Samuel/G-3447-2014","Galbraith, ED (reprint author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Earth & Ocean Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,116.0,Carbon dioxide release from the North Pacific abyss during the last deglaciation,1.0,30.0,WOS:000250230600043,332.0,449,Multidisciplinary Sciences,116,roger,francois,3429.0,1220,male,1.0,wa5soqQAAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",19978989,1,33138,1,Roger François,Roger François,0,0
33,58,314.0,"Chronic inflammation has long been associated with increased incidence of malignancy and similarities in the regulatory mechanisms have been suggested for more than a century(1). Infiltration of innate immune cells, elevated activities of matrix metalloproteases and increased angiogenesis and vasculature density are a few examples of the similarities between chronic and tumour-associated inflammation(2). Conversely, the elimination of early malignant lesions by immune surveillance, which relies on the cytotoxic activity of tumour-infiltrating T cells or intra-epithelial lymphocytes, is thought to be rate-limiting for the risk to develop cancer(3). Here we show a molecular connection between the rise in tumour-associated inflammation and a lack of tumour immune surveillance. Expression of the heterodimeric cytokine interleukin (IL)-23, but not of its close relative IL-12, is increased in human tumours. Expression of these cytokines antagonistically regulates local inflammatory responses in the tumour microenvironment and infiltration of intra-epithelial lymphocytes. Whereas IL-12 promotes infiltration of cytotoxic T cells, IL-23 promotes inflammatory responses such as upregulation of the matrix metalloprotease MMP9, and increases angiogenesis but reduces CD8 T-cell infiltration. Genetic deletion or antibody-mediated elimination of IL-23 leads to increased infiltration of cytotoxic T cells into the transformed tissue, rendering a protective effect against chemically induced carcinogenesis. Finally, transplanted tumours are growth-restricted in hosts depleted for IL-23 or in IL-23-receptor-deficient mice. Although many strategies for immune therapy of cancer attempt to stimulate an immune response against solid tumours, infiltration of effector cells into the tumour tissue often appears to be a critical hurdle(4-7). We show that IL-23 is an important molecular link between tumour-promoting pro-inflammatory processes and the failure of the adaptive immune surveillance to infiltrate tumours.","Langowski, John L.; Zhang, Xueqing; Wu, Lingling; Mattson, Jeanine D.; Chen, Taiying; Smith, Kathy; Basham, Beth; McClanahan, Terrill; Kastelein, Robert A.; Oft, Martin","Langowski, JL; Zhang, XQ; Wu, LL; Mattson, JD; Chen, TY; Smith, K; Basham, B; McClanahan, T; Kastelein, RA; Oft, M",461.0,"Schering Plough BioPharma, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature04808,Article,,martin.oft@spcorp.com,465,,,067CI,,,AUTOIMMUNE INFLAMMATION; ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY; T-CELLS; CANCER; SKIN; DISTINCT; INTERLEUKIN-12; RESISTANCE; CYTOKINE; IL-12,7101.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",27-Jul,5.0,LONDON,16688182.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,,"Oft, M (reprint author), Schering Plough BioPharma, 901 Calif Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,575.0,IL-23 promotes tumour incidence and growth,1.0,35.0,WOS:000239278900045,314.0,442,Multidisciplinary Sciences,616,martin,oft,3856.0,3568,male,1.0,c_Xosd0AAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",33768385,1,709683,1,Exploration Flight Test 1,Exploration Flight Test 1,0,0
34,32,443.0,"Molecular mechanisms regulating animal seasonal breeding in response to changing photoperiod are not well understood. Rapid induction of gene expression of thyroid- hormone- activating enzyme ( type 2 deiodinase, DIO2) in the mediobasal hypothalamus ( MBH) of the Japanese quail ( Coturnix japonica) is the earliest event yet recorded in the photoperiodic signal transduction pathway. Here we show cascades of gene expression in the quail MBH associated with the initiation of photoinduced secretion of luteinizing hormone. We identified two waves of gene expression. The first was initiated about 14 h after dawn of the first long day and included increased thyrotrophin ( TSH) beta- subunit expression in the pars tuberalis; the second occurred approximately 4 h later and included increased expression of DIO2. Intracerebroventricular ( ICV) administration of TSH to short- day quail stimulated gonadal growth and expression of DIO2 which was shown to be mediated through a TSH receptor - cyclic AMP ( cAMP) signalling pathway. Increased TSH in the pars tuberalis therefore seems to trigger long- day photoinduced seasonal breeding.","Nakao, Nobuhiro; Ono, Hiroko; Yamamura, Takashi; Anraku, Tsubasa; Takagi, Tsuyoshi; Higashi, Kumiko; Yasuo, Shinobu; Katou, Yasuhiro; Kageyama, Saburo; Uno, Yumiko; Kasukawa, Takeya; Iigo, Masayuki; Sharp, Peter J.; Iwasawa, Atsushi; Suzuki, Yutaka; Sugano, Sumio; Niimi, Teruyuki; Mizutani, Makoto; Namikawa, Takao; Ebihara, Shizufumi; Ueda, Hiroki R.; Yoshimura, Takashi","Nakao, N; Ono, H; Yamamura, T; Anraku, T; Takagi, T; Higashi, K; Yasuo, S; Katou, Y; Kageyama, S; Uno, Y; Kasukawa, T; Iigo, M; Sharp, PJ; Iwasawa, A; Suzuki, Y; Sugano, S; Niimi, T; Mizutani, M; Namikawa, T; Ebihara, S; Ueda, HR; Yoshimura, T",317.0,"[Nakao, Nobuhiro; Ono, Hiroko; Yamamura, Takashi; Anraku, Tsubasa; Takagi, Tsuyoshi; Higashi, Kumiko; Yasuo, Shinobu; Katou, Yasuhiro; Kageyama, Saburo; Uno, Yumiko; Ebihara, Shizufumi; Yoshimura, Takashi] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Bioagr Sci, Chikusa Ku, Div Biomodelling, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Kasukawa, Takeya; Ueda, Hiroki R.] RIKEN, Funct Genom Subunit, Ctr Dev Biol, Chuo Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan; [Iigo, Masayuki] Utsunomiya Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Appl Biochem, Utsunomiya, Tochigi 3218505, Japan; [Sharp, Peter J.] Univ Edinburgh, Div Genet & Genom, Roslin Inst, Roslin EH25 9PS, Midlothian, Scotland; [Sharp, Peter J.] Univ Edinburgh, Div Genet & Genom, Royal Dick Sch Vet Studies, Roslin EH25 9PS, Midlothian, Scotland; [Iwasawa, Atsushi] Gifu Univ, Lab Comparat Biochem, Grad Sch Appl Biol Sci, Gifu 5011193, Japan; [Suzuki, Yutaka; Sugano, Sumio] Univ Tokyo, Dept Med Genome Sci, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; [Niimi, Teruyuki] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Bioagr Sci, Chikusa Ku, Div Biofunct Dev, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Mizutani, Makoto; Namikawa, Takao; Ebihara, Shizufumi; Yoshimura, Takashi] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Bioagr Sci, Chikusa Ku, Avian Biosci Res Ctr, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Ueda, Hiroki R.] RIKEN, Lab Syst Biol, Ctr Dev Biol, Chuo Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan; [Yoshimura, Takashi] Nagoya Univ, Chikusa Ku, Inst Adv Res, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06738,Article,,takashiy@agr.nagoya-u.ac.jp,U1,,,276BX,,,II IODOTHYRONINE DEIODINASE; COTURNIX-COTURNIX-JAPONICA; JAPANESE-QUAIL; CHICKEN THYROTROPIN; GENE-EXPRESSION; CIRCADIAN CLOCK; BETA-SUBUNIT; HORMONE; RECEPTOR; BRAIN,7185.0,NATURE,Nature,English,39.0,No,"Yoshimura, Takashi/0000-0001-7018-9652; Kasukawa, Takeya/0000-0001-5085-0802","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",20-Mar,7.0,LONDON,18354476.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,"Yoshimura, Takashi/C-8306-2012; Ueda, Hiroki/C-5037-2014; Kasukawa, Takeya/N-5070-2015","Yoshimura, T (reprint author), Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Bioagr Sci, Chikusa Ku, Div Biomodelling, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,233.0,Thyrotrophin in the pars tuberalis triggers photoperiodic response,0.0,48.0,WOS:000254117400039,443.0,452,Multidisciplinary Sciences,240,takashi,yoshimura,2197.0,16,male,1.0,70uGLR0AAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",34529736,1,18969,1,Tempest 3D,Tempest 3D,0,0
35,66,169.0,"Over a century of research into the origin of turbulence in wall-bounded shear flows has resulted in a puzzling picture in which turbulence appears in a variety of different states competing with laminar background flow(1-6). At moderate flow speeds, turbulence is confined to localized patches; it is only at higher speeds that the entire flow becomes turbulent. The origin of the different states encountered during this transition, the front dynamics of the turbulent regions and the transformation to full turbulence have yet to be explained. By combining experiments, theory and computer simulations, here we uncover a bifurcation scenario that explains the transformation to fully turbulent pipe flow and describe the front dynamics of the different states encountered in the process. Key to resolving this problem is the interpretation of the flow as a bistable system with nonlinear propagation (advection) of turbulent fronts. These findings bridge the gap between our understanding of the onset of turbulence(7) and fully turbulent flows(8,9).","Barkley, Dwight; Song, Baofang; Mukund, Vasudevan; Lemoult, Gregoire; Avila, Marc; Hof, Bjoern","Barkley, D; Song, BF; Mukund, V; Lemoult, G; Avila, M; Hof, B",550.0,"[Barkley, Dwight] Univ Warwick, Inst Math, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Song, Baofang; Mukund, Vasudevan; Lemoult, Gregoire; Hof, Bjoern] IST Austria, A-3400 Klosterneuburg, Austria; [Song, Baofang] Max Planck Inst Dynam & Self Org, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Song, Baofang] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Inst Multiscale Simulat, D-91052 Erlangen, Germany; [Avila, Marc] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Inst Fluid Mech, D-91058 Erlangen, Germany",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15701,Article,1476-4687,D.Barkley@warwick.ac.uk; bhof@ist.ac.at,U191,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [FOR 1182]; European Research Council under the European Union [306589]; Chinese State Scholarship Fund [2010629145]; International Max Planck Research School for the Physics of Biological and Complex Systems; Gottingen Graduate School for Neurosciences and Molecular Biosciences; Julich Supercomputing Centre [HGU16],"We thank A.

36,153,126.0,"DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in repetitive sequences are a potent source of genomic instability, owing to the possibility of non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR). Repetitive sequences are especially at risk during meiosis, when numerous programmed DSBs are introduced into the genome to initiate meiotic recombination(1). In the repetitive ribosomal DNA (rDNA) array of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, meiotic DSB formation is prevented in part through Sir2-dependent heterochromatin formation(2,3). Here we show that the edges of the rDNA array are exceptionally susceptible to meiotic DSBs, revealing an inherent heterogeneity in the rDNA array. We find that this localized DSB susceptibility necessitates a border-specific protection system consisting of the meiotic ATPase Pch2 and the origin recognition complex subunit Orc1. Upon disruption of these factors, DSB formation and recombination increased specifically in the outermost rDNA repeats, leading to NAHR and rDNA instability. Notably, the Sir2-dependent heterochromatin of the rDNA itself was responsible for the induction of DSBs at the rDNA borders in pch2 Delta cells. Thus, although the activity of Sir2 globally prevents meiotic DSBs in the rDNA, it creates a highly permissive environment for DSB formation at the junctions between heterochromatin and euchromatin. Heterochromatinized repetitive DNA arrays are abundant in most eukaryotic genomes. Our data define the borders of such chromatin domains as distinct high-risk regions for meiotic NAHR, the protection of which may be a universal requirement to prevent meiotic genome rearrangements that are associated with genomic diseases and birth defects.","Vader, Gerben; Blitzblau, Hannah G.; Tame, Mihoko A.; Falk, Jill E.; Curtin, Lisa; Hochwagen, Andreas","Vader, G; Blitzblau, HG; Tame, MA; Falk, JE; Curtin, L; Hochwagen, A",115.0,"[Vader, Gerben; Blitzblau, Hannah G.; Tame, Mihoko A.; Falk, Jill E.; Curtin, Lisa; Hochwagen, Andreas] Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge Ctr 9, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Curtin, Lisa] Somerville High Sch, Somerville, MA 02143 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10331,Article,,andi@nyu.edu,U141,"NIH [GM088248]; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research [NWO Rubicon-825.08.009, NWO VENI-016.111.004]; HHMI [52005879]","We thank S.

37,82,70.0,"To repair double-strand DNA breaks by homologous recombination, the 5'-terminated DNA strand must first be resected, which generates 3' single-stranded DNA overhangs. Genetic evidence suggests that this process is initiated by the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 (MRX) complex(1-3). However, its involvement was puzzling, as the complex possesses exonuclease activity with the opposite (3' to 5') polarity from that required for homologous recombination(4,5). Consequently, a bidirectional model has been proposed(6-8) whereby dsDNA is first incised endonucleolytically and MRX then proceeds back to the dsDNA end using its 3' to 5' exonuclease. The endonuclease creates entry sites for Sgs1-Dna2 and/or Exo1, which then carry out long-range resection in the 5' to 3' direction. However, the identity of the endonuclease remained unclear. Using purified Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins, we show that Sae2 promotes dsDNA-specific endonuclease activity by the Mre11 subunit within the MRX complex. The endonuclease preferentially cleaves the 5'-terminated dsDNA strand, which explains the polarity paradox. The dsDNA end clipping is strongly stimulated by protein blocks at the DNA end, and requires the ATPase activity ofRad50 and physical interactions between MRX and Sae2. Our results suggest that MRX initiates dsDNA break processing by dsDNA endonuclease rather than exonuclease activity, and that Sae2 is the key regulator of this process. These findings demonstrate a probable mechanism for the initiation of dsDNA break processing in both vegetative and meiotic cells.","Cannavo, Elda; Cejka, Petr","Cannavo, E; Cejka, P",122.0,"[Cannavo, Elda; Cejka, Petr] Univ Zurich, Inst Mol Canc Res, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13771,Article,1476-4687,cejka@imcr.uzh.ch,+,Swiss National Science Foundation [PP00P3 133636],"We thank L.

38,129,162.0,"Neurotensin (NTS) is a 13-amino-acid peptide that functions as both a neurotransmitter and a hormone through the activation of the neurotensin receptor NTSR1, a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). In the brain, NTS modulates the activity of dopaminergic systems, opioid-independent analgesia, and the inhibition of food intake; in the gut, NTS regulates a range of digestive processes. Here we present the structure at 2.8 angstrom resolution of Rattus norvegicus NTSR1 in an active-like state, bound to NTS8-13, the carboxy-terminal portion of NTS responsible for agonist-induced activation of the receptor. The peptide agonist binds to NTSR1 in an extended conformation nearly perpendicular to the membrane plane, with the C terminus oriented towards the receptor core. Our findings provide, to our knowledge, the first insight into the binding mode of a peptide agonist to a GPCR and may support the development of non-peptide ligands that could be useful in the treatment of neurological disorders, cancer and obesity.","White, Jim F.; Noinaj, Nicholas; Shibata, Yoko; Love, James; Kloss, Brian; Xu, Feng; Gvozdenovic-Jeremic, Jelena; Shah, Priyanka; Shiloach, Joseph; Tate, Christopher G.; Grisshammer, Reinhard","White, JF; Noinaj, N; Shibata, Y; Love, J; Kloss, B; Xu, F; Gvozdenovic-Jeremic, J; Shah, P; Shiloach, J; Tate, CG; Grisshammer, R",508.0,"[White, Jim F.; Xu, Feng; Gvozdenovic-Jeremic, Jelena; Shah, Priyanka; Grisshammer, Reinhard] Natl Inst Neurol Disorders & Stroke, Membrane Prot Struct Funct Unit, NIH, US Dept HHS, Rockville, MD 20852 USA; [Noinaj, Nicholas] NIDDKD, Mol Biol Lab, NIH, US Dept HHS, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Shibata, Yoko; Tate, Christopher G.] MRC, Mol Biol Lab, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England; [Love, James; Kloss, Brian] New York Struct Biol Ctr, New York Consortium Membrane Prot Struct, Prot Prod Facil, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Shiloach, Joseph] NIDDKD, Biotechnol Core Lab, NIH, US Dept HHS, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11558,Article,,rkgriss@helix.nih.gov,+,"National Institutes of Health (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke); National Institutes of Health (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases); Pfizer Global Research and Development; MRCT Development Gap Fund; UK Medical Research Council [MRC U105197215]; National Institutes of Health [U54GM075026]; NIH Roadmap grant [P50 GM073197]; US Department of Energy, Basic Energy Sciences, Office of Science [DE-AC02-06CH11357]","This research was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institutes of Health (J.F.W., J.G.-J., P.S. and R.G.: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke; N.N. and J.S.: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) and a joint grant from Pfizer Global Research and Development and the MRCT Development Gap Fund in addition to core funding from the UK Medical Research Council MRC U105197215 (Y.S., C.G.T.).

39,135,465.0,"In the prehistoric green Sahara of Holocene North Africa-in contrast to the Neolithic of Europe and Eurasia-a reliance on cattle, sheep and goats emerged as a stable and widespread way of life, long before the first evidence for domesticated plants or settled village farming communities(1-3). The remarkable rock art found widely across the region depicts cattle herding among early Saharan pastoral groups, and includes rare scenes of milking; however, these images can rarely be reliably dated(4). Although the faunal evidence provides further confirmation of the importance of cattle and other domesticates(5), the scarcity of cattle bones makes it impossible to ascertain herd structures via kill-off patterns, thereby precluding interpretations of whether dairying was practiced. Because pottery production begins early in northern Africa(6) the potential exists to investigate diet and subsistence practices using molecular and isotopic analyses of absorbed food residues(7). This approach has been successful in determining the chronology of dairying beginning in the 'Fertile Crescent' of the Near East and its spread across Europe(8-11). Here we report the first unequivocal chemical evidence, based on the delta C-13 and Delta C-13 values of the major alkanoic acids of milk fat, for the adoption of dairying practices by prehistoric Saharan African people in the fifth millennium BC. Interpretations are supported by a new database of modern ruminant animal fats collected from Africa. These findings confirm the importance of 'lifetime products', such as milk, in early Saharan pastoralism, and provide an evolutionary context for the emergence of lactase persistence in Africa.","Dunne, Julie; Evershed, Richard P.; Salque, Melanie; Cramp, Lucy; Bruni, Silvia; Ryan, Kathleen; Biagetti, Stefano; di Lernia, Savino","Dunne, J; Evershed, RP; Salque, M; Cramp, L; Bruni, S; Ryan, K; Biagetti, S; di Lernia, S",390.0,"[Dunne, Julie; Evershed, Richard P.; Salque, Melanie; Cramp, Lucy] Univ Bristol, Sch Chem, Organ Geochem Unit, Bristol BS8 1TS, Avon, England; [Bruni, Silvia] Univ Milan, Dipartimento Chim Inorgan Metallorgan & Analit La, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Ryan, Kathleen] Univ Penn, African Sect, Museum Archaeol & Anthropol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Biagetti, Stefano; di Lernia, Savino] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Sci Antichita, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [di Lernia, Savino] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Geog Archaeology& Environm Sci, ZA-2050 Wits, South Africa",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11186,Article,,r.p.evershed@bristol.ac.uk; Savino.Dilernia@uniroma1.it,394,"UK Natural Environment Research Council; Sapienza, University of Rome (Grandi Scavi di Ateneo); Minister of Foreign Affairs (DGSP); USA National Science Foundation; Royal Society","We thank the UK Natural Environment Research Council for a PhD studentship to J.

40,111,355.0,"The discovery of quasicrystals(1)-crystalline structures that show order while lacking periodicity-forced a paradigm shift in crystallography. Initially limited to intermetallic systems(1-4), the observation of quasicrystalline structures has recently expanded to include 'soft' quasicrystals in the fields of colloidal and supermolecular chemistry(5-9). Here we report an aperiodic oxide that grows as a two-dimensional quasicrystal on a periodic single-element substrate. On a Pt(111) substrate with 3-fold symmetry, the perovskite barium titanate BaTiO3 forms a high-temperature interface-driven structure with 12-fold symmetry. The building blocks of this dodecagonal structure assemble with the theoretically predicted Stampfli-Gahler tiling(10,11) having a fundamental length-scale of 0.69 nm. This example of interface-driven formation of ultrathin quasicrystals from a typical periodic perovskite oxide potentially extends the quasicrystal concept to a broader range of materials. In addition, it demonstrates that frustration at the interface between two periodic materials can drive a thin film into an aperiodic quasicrystalline phase, as proposed previously(12). Such structures might also find use as ultrathin buffer layers for the accommodation of large lattice mismatches in conventional epitaxy(13).","Foerster, Stefan; Meinel, Klaus; Hammer, Rene; Trautmann, Martin; Widdra, Wolf","Forster, S; Meinel, K; Hammer, R; Trautmann, M; Widdra, W",215.0,"[Foerster, Stefan; Meinel, Klaus; Hammer, Rene; Trautmann, Martin; Widdra, Wolf] Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Phys, D-06120 Halle, Germany; [Widdra, Wolf] Max Planck Inst Mikrostrukturphys, D-06120 Halle, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12514,Article,1476-4687,wolf.widdra@physik.uni-halle.de,+,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [Sonderforschungsbereich 762],"We thank P.

However, in most plant species members of this family have evolved to transport nitrate as well as additional secondary metabolites and hormones. In response to falling nitrate levels, NRT1.1 is phosphorylated on an intracellular threonine that switches the transporter from a low-affinity to high-affinity state. Here we present both the apo and nitrate-bound crystal structures of Arabidopsis thaliana NRT1.1, which together with in vitro binding and transport data identify a key role for His 356 in nitrate binding. Our data support a model whereby phosphorylation increases structural flexibility and in turn the rate of transport. Comparison with peptide transporters further reveal show the NRT1/PTR family has evolved to recognize diverse nitrogenous ligands, while maintaining elements of a conserved coupling mechanism within this superfamily of nutrient transporters.","Parker, Joanne L.; Newstead, Simon","Parker, JL; Newstead, S",68.0,"[Parker, Joanne L.; Newstead, Simon] Univ Oxford, Dept Biochem, Oxford OX1 3QU, England; [Newstead, Simon] Rutherford Appleton Lab, Didcot OX11 0FA, Oxon, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13116,Article,1476-4687,joanne.parker@bioch.ox.ac.uk; simon.newstead@bioch.ox.ac.uk,+,"Medical Research Council (MRC) [G0900399]; Royal Society [RG110211, IE111401]","We thank R.

42,67,182.0,"The altered activity of the fructose transporter GLUT5, an isoform of the facilitated-diffusion glucose transporter family, has been linked to disorders such as type 2 diabetes and obesity. GLUT5 is also overexpressed in certain tumour cells, and inhibitors are potential drugs for these conditions. Here we describe the crystal structures of GLUT5 from Rattus norvegicus and Bos taurus in open outward-and open inward-facing conformations, respectively. GLUT5 has a major facilitator superfamily fold like other homologous monosaccharide transporters. On the basis of a comparison of the inward-facing structures of GLUT5 and human GLUT1, a ubiquitous glucose transporter, we show that a single point mutation is enough to switch the substrate-binding preference of GLUT5 from fructose to glucose. A comparison of the substrate-free structures of GLUT5 with occluded substrate-bound structures of Escherichia coli XylE suggests that, in addition to global rocker-switch-like re-orientation of the bundles, local asymmetric rearrangements of carboxy-terminal transmembrane bundle helices TM7 and TM10 underlie a 'gated-pore' transport mechanism in such monosaccharide transporters.","Nomura, Norimichi; Verdon, Gregory; Kang, Hae Joo; Shimamura, Tatsuro; Nomura, Yayoi; Sonoda, Yo; Hussien, Saba Abdul; Qureshi, Aziz Abdul; Coincon, Mathieu; Sato, Yumi; Abe, Hitomi; Nakada-Nakura, Yoshiko; Hino, Tomoya; Arakawa, Takatoshi; Kusano-Arai, Osamu; Iwanari, Hiroko; Murata, Takeshi; Kobayashi, Takuya; Hamakubo, Takao; Kasahara, Michihiro; Iwata, So; Drew, David","Nomura, N; Verdon, G; Kang, HJ; Shimamura, T; Nomura, Y; Sonoda, Y; Hussien, SA; Qureshi, AA; Coincon, M; Sato, Y; Abe, H; Nakada-Nakura, Y; Hino, T; Arakawa, T; Kusano-Arai, O; Iwanari, H; Murata, T; Kobayashi, T; Hamakubo, T; Kasahara, M; Iwata, S; Drew, D",397.0,"[Nomura, Norimichi; Shimamura, Tatsuro; Nomura, Yayoi; Sato, Yumi; Abe, Hitomi; Nakada-Nakura, Yoshiko; Hino, Tomoya; Arakawa, Takatoshi; Murata, Takeshi; Kobayashi, Takuya; Iwata, So] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Nomura, Norimichi; Shimamura, Tatsuro; Nomura, Yayoi; Hino, Tomoya; Arakawa, Takatoshi; Murata, Takeshi; Kobayashi, Takuya; Iwata, So] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, ERATO, Iwata Human Receptor Crystallog Project, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Nomura, Norimichi; Shimamura, Tatsuro; Nomura, Yayoi; Nakada-Nakura, Yoshiko; Murata, Takeshi; Kobayashi, Takuya; Iwata, So] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, Res Accelerat Program, Membrane Prot Crystallog Project, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Verdon, Gregory; Kang, Hae Joo; Sonoda, Yo; Iwata, So; Drew, David] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Div Mol Biosci, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Verdon, Gregory; Kang, Hae Joo; Iwata, So] Diamond Light Source, Membrane Prot Lab, Chilton OX11 0DE, Oxon, England; [Verdon, Gregory; Kang, Hae Joo; Iwata, So] Rutherford Appleton Lab, Res Complex Harwell, Didcot OX11 0FA, Oxon, England; [Hussien, Saba Abdul; Qureshi, Aziz Abdul; Coincon, Mathieu; Drew, David] Stockholm Univ, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Ctr Biomembrane Res, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Kusano-Arai, Osamu; Hamakubo, Takao] Univ Tokyo, Dept Quantitat Biol & Med, Res Ctr Adv Sci & Technol, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1538904, Japan; [Murata, Takeshi; Iwata, So] RIKEN, Syst & Struct Biol Ctr, Tsurumi Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Kasahara, Michihiro] Teikyo Univ, Sch Med, Biophys Lab, Hachioji, Tokyo 1920395, Japan",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14909,Article,1476-4687,nnomura@mfour.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp; s.iwata@mfour.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp; ddrew@dbb.su.se,+,"Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation; Royal Society; BBSRC [BB/G02325/1]; ERATO Human Receptor Crystallography Project of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST); Research Acceleration Program of the JST; Targeted Proteins Research Program of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan; MEXT [22570114]; MEXT; Wellcome Trust at the Diamond Light Source Limited [062164/Z/00/Z]; Centre for Biomembrane Research (CBR) - Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research; Human Frontiers Postdoctoral fellowship; EMBO through Young Investigator Program (YIP)","We are grateful to D.

43,85,143.0,"Knowledge of the early evolution of fish largely depends on soft-bodied material from the Lower (Series 2) Cambrian period of South China(1,2). Owing to the rarity of some of these forms and a general lack of comparative material from other deposits, interpretations of various features remain controversial(3,4), as do their wider relationships amongst post-Cambrian early un-skeletonized jawless vertebrates. Here we redescribe Metaspriggina(5) on the basis of new material from the Burgess Shale and exceptionally preserved material collected near Marble Canyon, British Columbia(6), and three other Cambrian Burgess Shale-type deposits from Laurentia. This primitive fish displays unambiguous vertebrate features: a notochord, a pair of prominent camera-type eyes, paired nasal sacs, possible cranium and arcualia, W-shaped myomeres, and a post-anal tail. A striking feature is the branchial area with an array of bipartite bars. Apart from the anterior most bar, which appears to be slightly thicker, each is associated with externally located gills, possibly housed in pouches. Phylogenetic analysis places Metaspriggina as a basal vertebrate, apparently close to the Chengjiang taxa Haikouichthys(1-4) and Myllokunmingia(1), demonstrating also that this primitive group of fish was cosmopolitan during Lower-Middle Cambrian times (Series 2-3). However, the arrangement of the branchial region in Metaspriggina has wider implications for reconstructing the morphology of the primitive vertebrate. Each bipartite bar is identified as being respectively equivalent to an epibranchial and ceratobranchial. This configuration suggests that a bipartite arrangement is primitive and reinforces the view that the branchial basket of lampreys(7) is probably derived. Other features of Metaspriggina, including the external position of the gills and possible absence of a gill opposite the more robust anterior-most bar, are characteristic of gnathostomes(8) and so may be primitive within vertebrates.","Morris, Simon Conway; Caron, Jean-Bernard","Morris, SC; Caron, JB",419.0,"[Morris, Simon Conway] Univ Cambridge, Dept Earth Sci, Cambridge CB2 3EQ, England; [Caron, Jean-Bernard] Royal Ontario Museum, Dept Nat Hist Palaeobiol, Toronto, ON M5S 2C6, Canada; [Caron, Jean-Bernard] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13414,Article,1476-4687,sc113@cam.ac.uk; jcaron@rom.on.ca,U413,"Department of Earth Sciences and St John's College, Cambridge; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council [341944]; Royal Ontario Museum [53]","We thank T.

45,140,201.0,"In 1961, Rolf Landauer argued that the erasure of information is a dissipative process(1). A minimal quantity of heat, proportional to the thermal energy and called the Landauer bound, is necessarily produced when a classical bit of information is deleted. A direct consequence of this logically irreversible transformation is that the entropy of the environment increases by a finite amount. Despite its fundamental importance for information theory and computer science(2-5), the erasure principle has not been verified experimentally so far, the main obstacle being the difficulty of doing single-particle experiments in the low-dissipation regime. Here we experimentally show the existence of the Landauer bound in a generic model of a one-bit memory. Using a system of a single colloidal particle trapped in a modulated double-well potential, we establish that the mean dissipated heat saturates at the Landauer bound in the limit of long erasure cycles. This result demonstrates the intimate link between information theory and thermodynamics. It further highlights the ultimate physical limit of irreversible computation.","Berut, Antoine; Arakelyan, Artak; Petrosyan, Artyom; Ciliberto, Sergio; Dillenschneider, Raoul; Lutz, Eric","Berut, A; Arakelyan, A; Petrosyan, A; Ciliberto, S; Dillenschneider, R; Lutz, E",187.0,"[Berut, Antoine; Arakelyan, Artak; Petrosyan, Artyom; Ciliberto, Sergio] Ecole Normale Super Lyon, Phys Lab, CNRS, UMR5672, F-69364 Lyon, France; [Dillenschneider, Raoul] Univ Kaiserslautern, Dept Phys, D-67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany; [Dillenschneider, Raoul] Univ Kaiserslautern, Res Ctr OPTIMAS, D-67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany; [Lutz, Eric] Univ Augsburg, Dept Phys, D-86135 Augsburg, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10872,Article,,eric.lutz@fu-berlin.de,U1500,"DFG [LU1382/1-1]; Cluster of Excellence Nanosystems Initiative Munich (NIM), DAAD; Research Center of the DFG [Transregio 49]","This work was supported by the Emmy Noether Program of the DFG (contract no.

46,5,238.0,"Sex determination is a fundamental biological process, yet its mechanisms are remarkably diverse(1,2). In vertebrates, sex can be determined by inherited genetic factors or by the temperature experienced during embryonic development(2,3). However, the evolutionary causes of this diversity remain unknown. Here we show that live-bearing lizards at different climatic extremes of the species' distribution differ in their sex-determining mechanisms, with temperature-dependent sex determination in lowlands and genotypic sex determination in highlands. A theoretical model parameterized with field data accurately predicts this divergence in sex-determining systems and the consequence thereof for variation in cohort sex ratios among years. Furthermore, we show that divergent natural selection on sex determination across altitudes is caused by climatic effects on lizard life history and variation in the magnitude of between-year temperature fluctuations. Our results establish an adaptive explanation for intra-specific divergence in sex-determining systems driven by phenotypic plasticity and ecological selection, thereby providing a unifying framework for integrating the developmental, ecological and evolutionary basis for variation in vertebrate sex determination.","Pen, Ido; Uller, Tobias; Feldmeyer, Barbara; Harts, Anna; While, Geoffrey M.; Wapstra, Erik","Pen, I; Uller, T; Feldmeyer, B; Harts, A; While, GM; Wapstra, E",436.0,"[Pen, Ido; Feldmeyer, Barbara; Harts, Anna] Univ Groningen, Theoret Biol Grp, NL-9750 AA Haren, Netherlands; [Uller, Tobias] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Edward Grey Inst, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [While, Geoffrey M.; Wapstra, Erik] Univ Tasmania, Sch Zool, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09512,Article,,i.r.pen@rug.nl,U262,Australian Research Council [DP0877948]; Hermon Slade Foundation; Wenner-Gren Foundations,"Funding was provided by the Australian Research Council to E.W., T.U. and I.P.

47,41,117.0,"Gamma- ray line radiation at 511 keV is the signature of electron positron annihilation. Such radiation has been known for 30 years to come from the general direction of the Galactic Centre(1), but the origin of the positrons has remained a mystery. Stellar nucleosynthesis(2-4), accreting compact objects(5-8), and even the annihilation of exotic dark- matter particles(9) have all been suggested. Here we report a distinct asymmetry in the 511- keV line emission coming from the inner Galactic disk ( similar to 10-50 degrees from the Galactic Centre). This asymmetry resembles an asymmetry in the distribution of low mass X- ray binaries with strong emission at photon energies >20 keV ('hard' LMXBs), indicating that they may be the dominant origin of the positrons. Although it had long been suspected that electron - positron pair plasmas may exist in X- ray binaries, it was not evident that many of the positrons could escape to lose energy and ultimately annihilate with electrons in the interstellar medium and thus lead to the emission of a narrow 511- keV line. For these models, our result implies that up to a few times 10(41) positrons escape per second from a typical hard LMXB. Positron production at this level from hard LMXBs in the Galactic bulge would reduce ( and possibly eliminate) the need for more exotic explanations, such as those involving dark matter.","Weidenspointner, Georg; Skinner, Gerry; Jean, Pierre; Knoedlseder, Juergen; von Ballmoos, Peter; Bignami, Giovanni; Diehl, Roland; Strong, Andrew W.; Cordier, Bertrand; Schanne, Stephane; Winkler, Christoph","Weidenspointner, G; Skinner, G; Jean, P; Knodlseder, J; von Ballmoos, P; Bignami, G; Diehl, R; Strong, AW; Cordier, B; Schanne, S; Winkler, C",159.0,"[Weidenspointner, Georg; Skinner, Gerry; Jean, Pierre; Knoedlseder, Juergen; von Ballmoos, Peter; Bignami, Giovanni] UPS, CNRS, Ctr Etud Spatiale Rayonnements, Toulouse 4, France; [Weidenspointner, Georg; Diehl, Roland; Strong, Andrew W.] Max Planck Inst Extraterr Phys, D-85741 Garching, Germany; [Weidenspointner, Georg] MPI Halbleiterlab, D-81739 Munich, Germany; [Skinner, Gerry] NASA, CRESST, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Skinner, Gerry] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Skinner, Gerry] Univ Maryland, Dept Astron, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Cordier, Bertrand; Schanne, Stephane] CEA Saclay, SAp, DAPNIA, DSM, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Winkler, Christoph] ESA, ESTEC, SCI SA, NL-2201 AZ Noordwijk, Netherlands; [Bignami, Giovanni] IUSS, I-27100 Pavia, Italy",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06490,Article,,Georg.Weidenspointner@hll.mpg.de,162,,,249GA,,,ANNIHILATION RADIATION; SKY DISTRIBUTION; INNER GALAXY; BLACK-HOLE; MILKY-WAY; EMISSION; AL-26; SEARCH,7175.0,NATURE,Nature,English,29.0,No,"Bignami, Giovanni/0000-0001-9582-2450","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",10-Jan,4.0,LONDON,18185581.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,,"Weidenspointner, G (reprint author), UPS, CNRS, Ctr Etud Spatiale Rayonnements, BP 44346, Toulouse 4, France.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,127.0,An asymmetric distribution of positrons in the Galactic disk revealed by gamma-rays,0.0,4.0,WOS:000252214400035,117.0,451,Multidisciplinary Sciences,127,christoph,winkler,3976.0,192,male,1.0,HIF10V0AAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
48,121,266.0,"Slower recovery from perturbations near a tipping point and its indirect signatures in fluctuation patterns have been suggested to foreshadow catastrophes in a wide variety of systems(1,2). Recent studies of populations in the field and in the laboratory have used time-series data to confirm some of the theoretically predicted early warning indicators, such as an increase in recovery time or in the size and timescale of fluctuations(3-6). However, the predictive power of temporal warning signals is limited by the demand for long-term observations. Large-scale spatial data are more accessible, but the performance of warning signals in spatially extended systems(7-10) needs to be examined empirically(3,11-13). Here we use spatially extended yeast populations, an experimental system with a fold bifurcation (tipping point)(6), to evaluate early warning signals based on spatio-temporal fluctuations and to identify a novel spatial warning indicator. We found that two leading indicators based on fluctuations increased before collapse of connected populations; however, the magnitudes of the increases were smaller than those observed in isolated populations, possibly because local variation is reduced by dispersal. Furthermore, we propose a generic indicator based on deterministic spatial patterns, which we call 'recovery length'. As the spatial counterpart of recovery time(14), recovery length is the distance necessary for connected populations to recover from spatial perturbations. In our experiments, recovery length increased substantially before population collapse, suggesting that the spatial scale of recovery can provide a superior warning signal before tipping points in spatially extended systems.","Dai, Lei; Korolev, Kirill S.; Gore, Jeff","Dai, L; Korolev, KS; Gore, J",355.0,"[Dai, Lei; Korolev, Kirill S.; Gore, Jeff] MIT, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12071,Article,,dailei@mit.edu; gore@mit.edu,+,"Whitaker Health Sciences Fund Fellowship; Pappalardo Fellowship; NIH [NIH R00 GM085279-02, NIH DP2]; NSF CAREER Award; Sloan Research Fellowship; Pew Scholars Program; Allen Investigator Program","We would like to thank D.

49,158,349.0,"A minority of individuals experiencing traumatic events develop anxiety disorders. The reason for the lack of correspondence between the prevalence of exposure to psychological trauma and the development of anxiety is unknown. Extracellular proteolysis contributes to fear-associated responses by facilitating neuronal plasticity at the neuron-matrix interface(1-4). Here we show in mice that the serine protease neuropsin is critical for stress-related plasticity in the amygdala by regulating the dynamics of the EphB2-NMDA-receptor interaction, the expression of Fkbp5 and anxiety-like behaviour. Stress results in neuropsin-dependent cleavage of EphB2 in the amygdala causing dissociation of EphB2 from the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor and promoting membrane turnover of EphB2 receptors. Dynamic EphB2-NR1 interaction enhances NMDA receptor current, induces Fkbp5 gene expression and enhances behavioural signatures of anxiety. On stress, neuropsin-deficient mice do not show EphB2 cleavage and its dissociation from NR1 resulting in a static EphB2-NR1 interaction, attenuated induction of the Fkbp5 gene and low anxiety. The behavioural response to stress can be restored by intra-amygdala injection of neuropsin into neuropsin-deficient mice and disrupted by the injection of either anti-EphB2 antibodies or silencing the Fkbp5 gene in the amygdala of wild-type mice. Our findings establish a novel neuronal pathway linking stress-induced proteolysis of EphB2 in the amygdala to anxiety.","Attwood, Benjamin K.; Bourgognon, Julie-Myrtille; Patel, Satyam; Mucha, Mariusz; Schiavon, Emanuele; Skrzypiec, Anna E.; Young, Kenneth W.; Shiosaka, Sadao; Korostynski, Michal; Piechota, Marcin; Przewlocki, Ryszard; Pawlak, Robert","Attwood, BK; Bourgognon, JM; Patel, S; Mucha, M; Schiavon, E; Skrzypiec, AE; Young, KW; Shiosaka, S; Korostynski, M; Piechota, M; Przewlocki, R; Pawlak, R",372.0,"[Attwood, Benjamin K.; Bourgognon, Julie-Myrtille; Patel, Satyam; Mucha, Mariusz; Schiavon, Emanuele; Skrzypiec, Anna E.; Pawlak, Robert] Univ Leicester, Dept Cell Physiol & Pharmacol, Leicester LE1 9HN, Leics, England; [Young, Kenneth W.] MRC, Toxicol Unit, Leicester LE1 9HN, Leics, England; [Shiosaka, Sadao] Nara Inst Sci & Technol, Div Struct Cell Biol, Nara 6300192, Japan; [Korostynski, Michal; Piechota, Marcin; Przewlocki, Ryszard] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Pharmacol, Dept Mol Neuropharmacol, PL-31343 Krakow, Poland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09938,Article,,rp135@le.ac.uk,U553,"Medical Research Council [G0500231/73852]; European Commission [MEXT-CT-2006-042265, LSHM-CT-2004-005166]; Medisearch Fellowship; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan [20300128]; Japan Science and Technology Agency; Ministry of Science and Higher Education of Poland [NN405 274137]","This work was supported by a Medical Research Council Project Grant (G0500231/73852), and a Marie Curie Excellence Grant (MEXT-CT-2006-042265 from the European Commission) to R.

50,124,467.0,"Cubic boron nitride (cBN) is a well known superhard material that has a wide range of industrial applications. Nanostructuring of cBN is an effective way to improve its hardness by virtue of the Hall-Petch effect-the tendency for hardness to increase with decreasing grain size(1,2). Polycrystalline cBN materials are often synthesized by using the martensitic transformation of a graphite-like BN precursor, in which high pressures and temperatures lead to puckering of the BN layers(3). Such approaches have led to synthetic polycrystalline cBN having grain sizes as small as similar to 14 nm (refs 1, 2, 4, 5). Here we report the formation of cBN with a nanostructure dominated by fine twin domains of average thickness similar to 3.8 nm. This nanotwinned cBN was synthesized from specially prepared BN precursor nanoparticles possessing onion-like nested structures with intrinsically puckered BN layers and numerous stacking faults. The resulting nanotwinned cBN bulk samples are optically transparent with a striking combination of physical properties: an extremely high Vickers hardness (exceeding 100 GPa, the optimal hardness of synthetic diamond), a high oxidization temperature (similar to 1,294 degrees C) and a large fracture toughness (>12 MPa m(1/2), well beyond the toughness of commercial cemented tungsten carbide, similar to 10 MPa m(1/2)). We show that hardening of cBN is continuous with decreasing twin thickness down to the smallest sizes investigated, contrasting with the expected reverse Hall-Petch effect below a critical grain size or the twin thickness of similar to 10-15 nm found in metals and alloys.","Tian, Yongjun; Xu, Bo; Yu, Dongli; Ma, Yanming; Wang, Yanbin; Jiang, Yingbing; Hu, Wentao; Tang, Chengchun; Gao, Yufei; Luo, Kun; Zhao, Zhisheng; Wang, Li-Min; Wen, Bin; He, Julong; Liu, Zhongyuan","Tian, YJ; Xu, B; Yu, DL; Ma, YM; Wang, YB; Jiang, YB; Hu, WT; Tang, CC; Gao, YF; Luo, K; Zhao, ZS; Wang, LM; Wen, B; He, JL; Liu, ZY",385.0,"[Tian, Yongjun; Xu, Bo; Yu, Dongli; Hu, Wentao; Gao, Yufei; Luo, Kun; Zhao, Zhisheng; Wang, Li-Min; Wen, Bin; He, Julong; Liu, Zhongyuan] Yanshan Univ, State Key Lab Metastable Mat Sci & Technol, Qinhuangdao 066004, Peoples R China; [Ma, Yanming] Jilin Univ, State Key Lab Superhard Mat, Changchun 130012, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yanbin] Univ Chicago, Ctr Adv Radiat Sources, Chicago, IL 60439 USA; [Jiang, Yingbing] Univ New Mexico, TEM Lab, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Tang, Chengchun] Hebei Univ Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Tianjin 300130, Peoples R China",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11728,Article,,fhcl@ysu.edu.cn,388,"Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2011CB808205, 2010CB731605]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51121061, 51172197, 11025418, 91022029]; US National Science Foundation [EAR-0968456]","We thank J.

51,75,411.0,"Hydrothermal venting along mid-ocean ridges exerts an important control on the chemical composition of sea water by serving as a major source or sink for a number of trace elements in the ocean(1-3). Of these, iron has received considerable attention because of its role as an essential and often limiting nutrient for primary production in regions of the ocean that are of critical importance for the global carbon cycle(4). It has been thought that most of the dissolved iron discharged by hydrothermal vents is lost from solution close to ridge-axis sources(2,5) and is thus of limited importance for ocean biogeochemistry(6). This long-standing view is challenged by recent studies which suggest that stabilization of hydrothermal dissolved iron may facilitate its longrange oceanic transport(7-10). Such transport has been subsequently inferred from spatially limited oceanographic observations(11-13). Here we report data from the US GEOTRACES Eastern Pacific Zonal Transect (EPZT) that demonstrate lateral transport of hydrothermal dissolved iron, manganese, and aluminium from the southern East Pacific Rise (SEPR) several thousand kilometres westward across the South Pacific Ocean. Dissolved iron exhibits nearly conservative (that is, no loss from solution during transport and mixing) behaviour in this hydrothermal plume, implying a greater longevity in the deep ocean than previously assumed(6,14). Based on our observations, we estimate a global hydrothermal dissolved iron input of three to four gigamoles per year to the ocean interior, which is more than fourfold higher than previous estimates(7,11,14). Complementary simulations with a global-scale ocean biogeochemical model suggest that the observed transport of hydrothermal dissolved iron requires some means of physicochemical stabilization and indicate that hydrothermally derived iron sustains a large fraction of Southern Ocean export production.","Resing, Joseph A.; Sedwick, Peter N.; German, Christopher R.; Jenkins, William J.; Moffett, James W.; Sohst, Bettina M.; Tagliabue, Alessandro","Resing, JA; Sedwick, PN; German, CR; Jenkins, WJ; Moffett, JW; Sohst, BM; Tagliabue, A",200.0,"[Resing, Joseph A.] Univ Washington, Joint Inst Study Atmosphere & Ocean, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Resing, Joseph A.] NOAA, PMEL, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Sedwick, Peter N.; Sohst, Bettina M.] Old Dominion Univ, Dept Ocean Earth & Atmospher Sci, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA; [German, Christopher R.; Jenkins, William J.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Moffett, James W.] Univ So Calif, Dept Biol Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Tagliabue, Alessandro] Univ Liverpool, Sch Environm Sci, Dept Earth Ocean & Ecol Sci, Liverpool L69 3GP, Merseyside, England",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14577,Article,1476-4687,resing@uw.edu; a.tagliabue@liverpool.ac.uk,U140,"US National Science Foundation [OCE-1237011, OCE-1237034, OCE-1232991, OCE-1130870, OCE-1131731, OCE-1260273]; N8 consortium; EPSRC [EP/K000225/1]; Humboldt Research Award; JISAO by the PMEL-Earth Oceans Interactions programme","We thank the captain and crew of the RV Thomas G.

52,86,146.0,"Bone-resorbing osteoclasts significantly contribute to osteoporosis and bone metastases of cancer(1-3). MicroRNAs play important roles in physiology and disease(4,5), and present tremendous therapeutic potential(6). Nonetheless, how microRNAs regulate skeletal biology is underexplored. Here we identify miR-34a as a novel and critical suppressor of osteoclastogenesis, bone resorption and the bone metastatic niche. miR-34a is downregulated during osteoclast differentiation. Osteoclastic miR-34a-overexpressing transgenic mice exhibit lower bone resorption and higher bone mass. Conversely, miR-34a knockout and heterozygous mice exhibit elevated bone resorption and reduced bone mass. Consequently, ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis, as well as bone metastasis of breast and skin cancers, are diminished in osteoclastic miR-34a transgenic mice, and can be effectively attenuated by miR-34a nanoparticle treatment. Mechanistically, we identify transforming growth factor-beta-induced factor 2 (Tgif2) as an essential direct miR-34a target that is pro-osteoclastogenic. Tgif2 deletion reduces bone resorption and abolishes miR-34a regulation. Together, using mouse genetic, pharmacological and disease models, we reveal miR-34a as a key osteoclast suppressor and a potential therapeutic strategy to confer skeletal protection and ameliorate bone metastasis of cancers.","Krzeszinski, Jing Y.; Wei, Wei; HoangDinh Huynh; Jin, Zixue; Wang, Xunde; Chang, Tsung-Cheng; Xie, Xian-Jin; He, Lin; Mangala, Lingegowda S.; Lopez-Berestein, Gabriel; Sood, Anil K.; Mendell, Joshua T.; Wan, Yihong","Krzeszinski, JY; Wei, W; Huynh, H; Jin, ZX; Wang, XD; Chang, TC; Xie, XJ; He, L; Mangala, LS; Lopez-Berestein, G; Sood, AK; Mendell, JT; Wan, YH",431.0,"[Krzeszinski, Jing Y.; Wei, Wei; HoangDinh Huynh; Jin, Zixue; Wang, Xunde; Wan, Yihong] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Pharmacol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Chang, Tsung-Cheng; Mendell, Joshua T.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Mol Biol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Xie, Xian-Jin; Mendell, Joshua T.; Wan, Yihong] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Simmons Canc Ctr, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Xie, Xian-Jin] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Clin Sci, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [He, Lin] Univ Calif Berkeley, Mol & Cell Biol Dept, Div Cellular & Dev Biol, Berkeley, CA 94705 USA; [Mangala, Lingegowda S.; Sood, Anil K.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Gynecol Oncol & Reprod Med, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Mangala, Lingegowda S.; Lopez-Berestein, Gabriel; Sood, Anil K.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Ctr RNA Interference & Noncoding RNA, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Lopez-Berestein, Gabriel] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Expt Therapeut, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Sood, Anil K.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Canc Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13375,Article,1476-4687,yihong.wan@utsouthwestern.edu,U460,"CPRIT [RP130145, R1008]; DOD [BC122877]; National Institutes of Health [R01 DK089113, R01 CA120185, P01 CA134292, U54 CA151668, UH2 TR000943, R01 CA139067]; Welch Foundation [I-1751]; University of Texas Southwestern Endowed Scholar Startup Fund; Harold C.

Here we report the most complete structure obtained so far, to our knowledge, of the 380-kDa motor domain of Dictyostelium discoideum cytoplasmic dynein at 2.8 angstrom resolution; the data are reliable enough to discuss the structure and mechanism at the level of individual amino acid residues. Features that can be clearly visualized at this resolution include the coordination of ADP in each of four distinct nucleotide-binding sites in the ring-shaped AAA(+) ATPase unit, a newly identified interaction interface between the ring and mechanical linker, and junctional structures between the ring and microtubule-binding stalk, all of which should be critical for the mechanism of dynein motility. We also identify a long-range allosteric communication pathway between the primary ATPase and the microtubule-binding sites. Our work provides a framework for understanding the mechanism of dynein-based motility.","Kon, Takahide; Oyama, Takuji; Shimo-Kon, Rieko; Imamula, Kenji; Shima, Tomohiro; Sutoh, Kazuo; Kurisu, Genji","Kon, T; Oyama, T; Shimo-Kon, R; Imamula, K; Shima, T; Sutoh, K; Kurisu, G",345.0,"[Kon, Takahide; Oyama, Takuji; Shimo-Kon, Rieko; Kurisu, Genji] Osaka Univ, Inst Prot Res, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Kon, Takahide; Kurisu, Genji] Osaka Univ, Dept Macromol Sci, Sch Sci, Osaka 5600043, Japan; [Imamula, Kenji] Univ Tokyo, Dept Life Sci, Sch Arts & Sci, Tokyo 1538902, Japan; [Shima, Tomohiro] Univ Tokyo, Dept Phys, Grad Sch Sci, Bunkyou Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Sutoh, Kazuo] Waseda Univ, Res Inst Sci & Engn, Toshima Ku, Tokyo 1710033, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10955,Article,1476-4687,takahide.kon@protein.osaka-u.ac.jp,U81,"Ministry of Education, Culture Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan [17770126, 20687011, 23370073, 16083205, 17107003, 17053006, 18054008, 20051006]; Human Frontier Science Program","We thank E.

54,106,231.0,"Newborn infants are highly susceptible to infection. This defect in host defence has generally been ascribed to the immaturity of neonatal immune cells; however, the degree of hyporesponsiveness is highly variable and depends on the stimulation conditions(1-7). These discordant responses illustrate the need for a more unified explanation for why immunity is compromised in neonates. Here we show that physiologically enriched CD71(+) erythroid cells in neonatalmice and human cord blood have distinctive immunosuppressive properties. The production of innate immune protective cytokines by adult cells is diminished after transfer to neonatal mice or after co-culture with neonatal splenocytes. Neonatal CD71(+) cells express the enzyme arginase-2, and arginase activity is essential for the immunosuppressive properties of these cells because molecular inhibition of this enzyme or supplementation with L-arginine overrides immunosuppression. In addition, the ablation of CD71(+) cells in neonatal mice, or the decline in number of these cells as postnatal development progresses parallels the loss of suppression, and restored resistance to the perinatal pathogens Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli(8,9). However, CD71(+) cell-mediated susceptibility to infection is counterbalanced by CD71(+) cell-mediated protection against aberrant immune cell activation in the intestine, where colonization with commensal microorganisms occurs swiftly after parturition(10,11). Conversely, circumventing such colonization by using antimicrobials or gnotobiotic germ-free mice overrides these protective benefits. Thus, CD71(+) cells quench the excessive inflammation induced by abrupt colonization with commensal microorganisms after parturition. This finding challenges the idea that the susceptibility of neonates to infection reflects immune-cell-intrinsic defects and instead highlights processes that are developmentally more essential and inadvertently mitigate innate immune protection. We anticipate that these results will spark renewed investigation into the need for immunosuppression in neonates, as well as improved strategies for augmenting host defence in this vulnerable population.","Elahi, Shokrollah; Ertelt, James M.; Kinder, Jeremy M.; Jiang, Tony T.; Zhang, Xuzhe; Xin, Lijun; Chaturvedi, Vandana; Strong, Beverly S.; Qualls, Joseph E.; Steinbrecher, Kris A.; Kalfa, Theodosia A.; Shaaban, Aimen F.; Way, Sing Sing","Elahi, S; Ertelt, JM; Kinder, JM; Jiang, TT; Zhang, XZ; Xin, LJ; Chaturvedi, V; Strong, BS; Qualls, JE; Steinbrecher, KA; Kalfa, TA; Shaaban, AF; Way, SS",158.0,"[Elahi, Shokrollah; Ertelt, James M.; Kinder, Jeremy M.; Jiang, Tony T.; Zhang, Xuzhe; Xin, Lijun; Chaturvedi, Vandana; Qualls, Joseph E.; Way, Sing Sing] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Infect Dis, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Elahi, Shokrollah; Ertelt, James M.; Kinder, Jeremy M.; Jiang, Tony T.; Zhang, Xuzhe; Xin, Lijun; Chaturvedi, Vandana; Qualls, Joseph E.; Way, Sing Sing] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Perinatal Inst, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Strong, Beverly S.; Shaaban, Aimen F.] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Ctr Fetal Cellular & Mol Therapy, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Steinbrecher, Kris A.] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Gastroenterol, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Kalfa, Theodosia A.] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Hematol, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12675,Article,1476-4687,singsing.way@cchmc.org,+,"NIAID [R01AI087830, R01AI100934]; NHLBI [R01HL103745]; Burroughs Wellcome Fund","We thank D.

55,73,353.0,"West Africa is currently witnessing the most extensive Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak so far recorded(1-3). Until now, there have been 27,013 reported cases and 11,134 deaths. The origin of the virus is thought to have been a zoonotic transmission from a bat to a two-year-old boy in December 2013 (ref. 2). From this index case the virus was spread by human-to-human contact throughout Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. However, the origin of the particular virus in each country and time of transmission is not known and currently relies on epidemiological analysis, which may be unreliable owing to the difficulties of obtaining patient information. Here we trace the genetic evolution of EBOV in the current outbreak that has resulted in multiple lineages. Deep sequencing of 179 patient samples processed by the European Mobile Laboratory, the first diagnostics unit to be deployed to the epicentre of the outbreak in Guinea, reveals an epidemiological and evolutionary history of the epidemic from March 2014 to January 2015. Analysis of EBOV genome evolution has also benefited from a similar sequencing effort of patient samples from Sierra Leone. Our results confirm that the EBOV from Guinea moved into Sierra Leone, most likely in April or early May. The viruses of the Guinea/Sierra Leone lineage mixed around June/July 2014. Viral sequences covering August, September and October 2014 indicate that this lineage evolved independently within Guinea. These data can be used in conjunction with epidemiological information to test retrospectively the effectiveness of control measures, and provides an unprecedented window into the evolution of an ongoing viral haemorrhagic fever outbreak.","Carroll, Miles W.; Matthews, David A.; Hiscox, Julian A.; Elmore, Michael J.; Pollakis, Georgios; Rambaut, Andrew; Hewson, Roger; Garcia-Dorival, Isabel; Bore, Joseph Akoi; Koundouno, Raymond; Abdellati, Said; Afrough, Babak; Aiyepada, John; Akhilomen, Patience; Asogun, Danny; Atkinson, Barry; Badusche, Marlis; Bah, Amadou; Bate, Simon; Baumann, Jan; Becker, Dirk; Becker-Ziaja, Beate; Bocquin, Anne; Borremans, Benny; Bosworth, Andrew; Boettcher, Jan Peter; Cannas, Angela; Carletti, Fabrizio; Castilletti, Concetta; Clark, Simon; Colavita, Francesca; Diederich, Sandra; Donatus, Adomeh; Duraffour, Sophie; Ehichioya, Deborah; Ellerbrok, Heinz; Fernandez-Garcia, Maria Dolores; Fizet, Alexandra; Fleischmann, Erna; Gryseels, Sophie; Hermelink, Antje; Hinzmann, Julia; Hopf-Guevara, Ute; Ighodalo, Yemisi; Jameson, Lisa; Kelterbaum, Anne; Kis, Zoltan; Kloth, Stefan; Kohl, Claudia; Korva, Misa; Kraus, Annette; Kuisma, Eeva; Kurth, Andreas; Liedigk, Britta; Logue, Christopher H.; Luedtke, Anja; Maes, Piet; McCowen, James; Mely, Stephane; Mertens, Marc; Meschi, Silvia; Meyer, Benjamin; Michel, Janine; Molkenthin, Peter; Munoz-Fontela, Cesar; Muth, Doreen; Newman, Edmund N.

56,146,425.0,"Climate change is driving latitudinal and altitudinal shifts in species distribution worldwide(1,2), leading to novel species assemblages(3,4). Lags between these biotic responses and contemporary climate changes have been reported for plants and animals(5). Theoretically, the magnitude of these lags should be greatest in lowland areas, where the velocity of climate change is expected to be much greater than that in highland areas(6). We compared temperature trends to temperatures reconstructed from plant assemblages (observed in 76,634 surveys) over a 44-year period in France (1965-2008). Here we report that forest plant communities had responded to 0.54 degrees C of the effective increase of 1.07 degrees C in highland areas (500-2,600 m above sea level), while they had responded to only 0.02 degrees C of the 1.11 degrees C warming trend in lowland areas. There was a larger temperature lag (by 3.1 times) between the climate and plant community composition in lowland forests than in highland forests. The explanation of such disparity lies in the following properties of lowland, as compared to highland, forests: the higher proportion of species with greater ability for local persistence as the climate warms(7), the reduced opportunity for short-distance escapes(8,9), and the greater habitat fragmentation. Although mountains are currently considered to be among the ecosystems most threatened by climate change (owing to mountaintop extinction), the current inertia of plant communities in lowland forests should also be noted, as it could lead to lowland biotic attrition(10).","Bertrand, Romain; Lenoir, Jonathan; Piedallu, Christian; Riofrio-Dillon, Gabriela; de Ruffray, Patrice; Vidal, Claude; Pierrat, Jean-Claude; Gegout, Jean-Claude","Bertrand, R; Lenoir, J; Piedallu, C; Riofrio-Dillon, G; de Ruffray, P; Vidal, C; Pierrat, JC; Gegout, JC",517.0,"[Bertrand, Romain; Piedallu, Christian; Riofrio-Dillon, Gabriela; Pierrat, Jean-Claude; Gegout, Jean-Claude] AgroParisTech, ENGREF, UMR1092, Lab Etud Ressources Foret Bois LERFoB, F-54000 Nancy, France; [Bertrand, Romain; Piedallu, Christian; Riofrio-Dillon, Gabriela; Pierrat, Jean-Claude; Gegout, Jean-Claude] INRA, Ctr Nancy, UMR1092, Lab Etud Ressources Foret Bois LERFoB, F-54280 Champenoux, France; [Lenoir, Jonathan] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Ecoinformat & Biodivers Grp, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [de Ruffray, Patrice] Univ Strasbourg UDS, Inst Biol Mol Plantes IBMP, CNRS, F-67084 Strasbourg, France; [Vidal, Claude] Inventaire Forestier Natl, F-45290 Nogent Sur Marne, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10548,Article,,romain.bertrand@engref.agroparistech.fr,520,"French Institute of Agricultural, Forest and Environmental Engineering (ENGREF, AgroParisTech); National Forest Department (ONF); French Agency for Environment and Energy Management (ADEME); Danish Council for Independent Research - Natural Sciences [272-07-0242]; ADEME; Regional Council of Lorraine","We thank J.-D.

Drug resistance is widespread, no new chemical class of antimalarials has been introduced into clinical practice since 1996 and there is a recent rise of parasite strains with reduced sensitivity to the newest drugs. We screened nearly 2 million compounds in GlaxoSmithKline's chemical library for inhibitors of P. falciparum, of which 13,533 were confirmed to inhibit parasite growth by at least 80% at 2 mu M concentration. More than 8,000 also showed potent activity against the multidrug resistant strain Dd2. Most (82%) compounds originate from internal company projects and are new to the malaria community. Analyses using historic assay data suggest several novel mechanisms of antimalarial action, such as inhibition of protein kinases and host-pathogen interaction related targets.

58,151,68.0,"Electrons in a metal are indistinguishable particles that interact strongly with other electrons and their environment. Isolating and detecting a single flying electron after propagation, in a similar manner to quantum optics experiments with single photons(1,2), is therefore a challenging task. So far only a few experiments have been performed in a high-mobility two-dimensional electron gas in which the electron propagates almost ballistically(3-5). In these previous works, flying electrons were detected by means of the current generated by an ensemble of electrons, and electron correlations were encrypted in the current noise. Here we demonstrate the experimental realization of high-efficiency single-electron source and detector for a single electron propagating isolated from the other electrons through a one-dimensional channel. The moving potential is excited by a surface acoustic wave, which carries the single electron along the one-dimensional channel at a speed of 3 mu m ns(-1). When this quantum channel is placed between two quantum dots several micrometres apart, a single electron can be transported from one quantum dot to the other with quantum efficiencies of emission and detection of 96% and 92%, respectively. Furthermore, the transfer of the electron can be triggered on a timescale shorter than the coherence time T-2* of GaAs spin qubits(6). Our work opens new avenues with which to study the teleportation of a single electron spin and the distant interaction between spatially separated qubits in a condensed-matter system.","Hermelin, Sylvain; Takada, Shintaro; Yamamoto, Michihisa; Tarucha, Seigo; Wieck, Andreas D.; Saminadayar, Laurent; Baeuerle, Christopher; Meunier, Tristan","Hermelin, S; Takada, S; Yamamoto, M; Tarucha, S; Wieck, AD; Saminadayar, L; Bauerle, C; Meunier, T",435.0,"[Hermelin, Sylvain; Saminadayar, Laurent; Baeuerle, Christopher; Meunier, Tristan] CNRS, Inst Neel, F-38042 Grenoble, France; [Hermelin, Sylvain; Saminadayar, Laurent; Baeuerle, Christopher; Meunier, Tristan] Univ Grenoble 1, F-38042 Grenoble, France; [Takada, Shintaro; Yamamoto, Michihisa; Tarucha, Seigo] Univ Tokyo, Dept Appl Phys, Tokyo 1138656, Japan; [Yamamoto, Michihisa] ERATO JST, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3310012, Japan; [Tarucha, Seigo] ICORP Int Cooperat Res Project Quantum Spin Infor, Atsugi, Kanagawa 2430198, Japan; [Wieck, Andreas D.] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Lehrstuhl Angew Festkorperphys, D-44780 Bochum, Germany; [Saminadayar, Laurent] Inst Univ France, F-75005 Paris, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10416,Article,,bauerle@grenoble.cnrs.fr; tristan.meunier@grenoble.cnrs.fr,438,"ERATO-JST [080300000477]; Special Coordination Funds for Promoting Science and Technology (NanoQuine); Japan Science and Technology Agency Strategic International Cooperative Program; Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology; Harvard University; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SPP1285]; Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung [QuaHLRep 01BQ1035]; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (DREI) - Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [PRC 424, L08519]; Marie-Curie European Reintegration Grant [224786]; Nanoscience Foundation of Grenoble;  [20684011]","We thank Y.

Although the need for both iron(II) and iron(III) is clear, little is known about the biological mechanisms controlling their ratio(1). Here we present the structure of the magnetosome-associated protein MamP and find that it is built on a unique arrangement of a self-plugged PDZ domain fused to two magnetochrome domains, defining a new class of c-type cytochrome exclusively found in magnetotactic bacteria. Mutational analysis, enzyme kinetics, co-crystallization with iron(II) and an in vitro MamP-assisted magnetite production assay establish MamP as an iron oxidase that contributes to the formation of iron(III) ferrihydrite eventually required for magnetite crystal growth in vivo. These results demonstrate the molecular mechanisms of iron management taking place inside the magnetosome and highlight the role of magnetochrome in iron biomineralization.","Siponen, Marina I.; Legrand, Pierre; Widdrat, Marc; Jones, Stephanie R.; Zhang, Wei-Jia; Chang, Michelle C.

60,6,301.0,"Two forms of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) ensure the selective silencing of female sex chromosomes during mouse embryogenesis. Imprinted XCI begins with the detection of Xist RNA expression on the paternal X chromosome (Xp) at about the four-cell stage of embryonic development. In the embryonic tissues of the inner cell mass, a random form of XCI occurs in blastocysts that inactivates either Xp or the maternal X chromosome (Xm)(1,2). Both forms of XCI require the non-coding Xist RNA that coats the inactive X chromosome from which it is expressed. Xist has crucial functions in the silencing of X-linked genes, including Rnf12 (refs 3, 4) encoding the ubiquitin ligase RLIM (RING finger LIM-domain-interacting protein). Here we show, by targeting a conditional knockout of Rnf12 to oocytes where RLIM accumulates to high levels, that the maternal transmission of the mutant X chromosome (Delta m) leads to lethality in female embryos as a result of defective imprinted XCI. We provide evidence that in Delta m female embryos the initial formation of Xist clouds and Xp silencing are inhibited. In contrast, embryonic stem cells lacking RLIM are able to form Xist clouds and silence at least some X-linked genes during random XCI. These results assign crucial functions to the maternal deposit of Rnf12/RLIM for the initiation of imprinted XCI.","Shin, JongDae; Bossenz, Michael; Chung, Young; Ma, Hong; Byron, Meg; Taniguchi-Ishigaki, Naoko; Zhu, Xiaochun; Jiao, Baowei; Hall, Lisa L.; Green, Michael R.; Jones, Stephen N.; Hermans-Borgmeyer, Irm; Lawrence, Jeanne B.; Bach, Ingolf","Shin, J; Bossenz, M; Chung, Y; Ma, H; Byron, M; Taniguchi-Ishigaki, N; Zhu, XC; Jiao, BW; Hall, LL; Green, MR; Jones, SN; Hermans-Borgmeyer, I; Lawrence, JB; Bach, I",977.0,"[Shin, JongDae; Ma, Hong; Taniguchi-Ishigaki, Naoko; Zhu, Xiaochun; Jiao, Baowei; Green, Michael R.; Bach, Ingolf] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Program Gene Funct & Express, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Green, Michael R.; Bach, Ingolf] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Program Mol Med, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Zhu, Xiaochun; Green, Michael R.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Byron, Meg; Hall, Lisa L.; Jones, Stephen N.; Lawrence, Jeanne B.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Bossenz, Michael; Hermans-Borgmeyer, Irm] Univ Hamburg, Ctr Mol Neurobiol, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany; [Chung, Young] Stem Cell & Regenerat Med Int Inc, Marlborough, MA 01752 USA; [Chung, Young] CHA Univ, Sch Med, Seoul 135081, South Korea",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09457,Article,,ingolf.bach@umassmed.edu,U157,"National Institutes of Health (National Cancer Institute) [R01CA131158]; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases [5 P30 DK32520, GM053234]","We thank V.

61,132,375.0,"Electromagnetic noise is emitted everywhere humans use electronic devices. For decades, it has been hotly debated whether man-made electric and magnetic fields affect biological processes, including human health(1-5). So far, no putative effect of anthropogenic electromagnetic noise at intensities below the guidelines adopted by the World Health Organization(1,2) has withstood the test of independent replication under truly blinded experimental conditions. No effect has therefore been widely accepted as scientifically proven(1-6). Here we show that migratory birds are unable to use their magnetic compass in the presence of urban electromagnetic noise. When European robins, Erithacus rubecula, were exposed to the background electromagnetic noise present in unscreened wooden huts at the University of Oldenburg campus, they could not orient using their magnetic compass. Their magnetic orientation capabilities reappeared inelectrically grounded, aluminium-screened huts, which attenuated electromagnetic noise in the frequency range from 50 kHz to 5 MHz by approximately two orders of magnitude. When the grounding was removed or when broadband electromagnetic noise was deliberately generated inside the screened and grounded huts, the birds again lost their magnetic orientation capabilities. The disruptive effect of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields is not confined to a narrow frequency band and birds tested far from sources of electromagnetic noise required no screening to orient with their magnetic compass. These fully double-blinded tests document a reproducible effect of anthropogenic electromagnetic noise on the behaviour of an intact vertebrate.","Engels, Svenja; Schneider, Nils-Lasse; Lefeldt, Nele; Hein, Christine Maira; Zapka, Manuela; Michalik, Andreas; Elbers, Dana; Kittel, Achim; Hore, P.

62,49,158.0,"On 12 May 2008, the devastating magnitude 7.9 (Wenchuan) earthquake struck the eastern edge of the Tibetan plateau, collapsing buildings and killing thousands in major cities aligned along the western Sichuan basin in China. After such a large-magnitude earthquake, rearrangement of stresses in the crust commonly leads to subsequent damaging earthquakes(1-5). The mainshock of the 12 May earthquake ruptured with as much as 9m of slip along the boundary between the Longmen Shan and Sichuan basin, and demonstrated the complex strike-slip and thrust motion(6) that characterizes the region(7,8). The Sichuan basin and surroundings are also crossed by other active strike-slip and thrust faults. Here we present calculations of the coseismic stress changes that resulted from the 12 May event using models of those faults, and show that many indicate significant stress increases. Rapid mapping of such stress changes can help to locate fault sections with relatively higher odds of producing large aftershocks.","Parsons, Tom; Ji, Chen; Kirby, Eric","Parsons, T; Ji, C; Kirby, E",509.0,"[Parsons, Tom] US Geol Survey, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Ji, Chen] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geol Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Kirby, Eric] Penn State Univ, Dept Geosci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07177,Article,,tparsons@usgs.gov,510,,,329IC,Y,N,SEISMIC HAZARD,7203.0,NATURE,Nature,English,13.0,No,"Parsons, Tom/0000-0002-0582-4338","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",24-Jul,2.0,LONDON,18600260.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,"Parsons, Tom/A-3424-2008","Parsons, T (reprint author), US Geol Survey, MS-999,345 Middlefield Rd, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,219.0,Stress changes from the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake and increased hazard in the Sichuan basin,4.0,142.0,WOS:000257860300049,158.0,454,Multidisciplinary Sciences,285,eric,kirby,6225.0,4110,male,1.0,Yv_7CL4AAAAJ,3,"(4126, 9345]",47154491,1,9599972,1,Eric Kirby,Eric Kirby,1,1
63,44,336.0,"AB(5) toxins comprise an A subunit that corrupts essential eukaryotic cell functions, and pentameric B subunits that direct targetcell uptake after binding surface glycans. Subtilase cytotoxin (SubAB) is an AB5 toxin secreted by Shiga toxigenic Escherichia coli (STEC)(1), which causes serious gastrointestinal disease in humans(2). SubAB causes haemolytic uraemic syndrome- like pathology in mice(3) through SubA- mediated cleavage of BiP/GRP78, an essential endoplasmic reticulum chaperone(4). Here we show that SubB has a strong preference for glycans terminating in the sialic acid N- glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), a monosaccharide not synthesized in humans. Structures of SubB - Neu5Gc complexes revealed the basis for this specificity, and mutagenesis of key SubB residues abrogated in vitro glycan recognition, cell binding and cytotoxicity. SubAB specificity for Neu5Gc was confirmed using mouse tissues with a human- like deficiency of Neu5Gc and human cell lines fed with Neu5Gc. Despite lack of Neu5Gc biosynthesis in humans, assimilation of dietary Neu5Gc creates high- affinity receptors on human gut epithelia and kidney vasculature. This, and the lack of Neu5Gc- containing body fluid competitors in humans, confers susceptibility to the gastrointestinal and systemic toxicities of SubAB. Ironically, foods rich in Neu5Gc are the most common source of STEC contamination. Thus a bacterial toxin's receptor is generated by metabolic incorporation of an exogenous factor derived from food.","Byres, Emma; Paton, Adrienne W.; Paton, James C.; Lofling, Jonas C.; Smith, David F.; Wilce, Matthew C.

64,211,202.0,"Strong-field physics, an extreme limit of light-matter interaction(1-3), is expanding into the realm of surfaces(4,5) and nanostructures(6-11) from its origin in atomic and molecular science(12-15). The attraction of nanostructures lies in two intimately connected features: local intensity enhancement and sub-wavelength confinement of optical fields. Local intensity enhancement facilitates access to the strong-field regime and has already sparked various applications, whereas spatial localization has the potential to generate strong-field dynamics exclusive to nanostructures. However, the observation of features unattainable in gaseous media is challenged by many-body effects and material damage, which arise under intense illumination of dense systems(16-19). Here, we non-destructively access this regime in the solid state by employing single plasmonic nanotips and few-cycle mid-infrared pulses, making use of the wavelength-dependence of the interaction, that is, the ponderomotive energy. We investigate strong-field photoelectron emission and acceleration from single nanostructures over a broad spectral range, and find kinetic energies of hundreds of electronvolts. We observe the transition to a new regime in strong-field dynamics, in which the electrons escape the nanolocalized field within a fraction of an optical half-cycle. The transition into this regime, characterized by a spatial adiabaticity parameter, would require relativistic electrons in the absence of nanostructures. These results establish new degrees of freedom for the manipulation and control of electron dynamics on femtosecond and attosecond timescales, combining optical near-fields and nanoscopic sources.","Herink, G.; Solli, D.

We have established a method for inducing functional genetic mosaics in the mouse. Using this system, here we show that induction of a mosaic imbalance of Myc expression in the epiblast provokes the expansion of cells with higher Myc levels through the apoptotic elimination of cells with lower levels, without disrupting development. In contrast, homogeneous shifts in Myc levels did not affect epiblast cell viability, indicating that the observed competition results from comparison of relative Myc levels between epiblast cells. During normal development we found that Myc levels are intrinsically heterogeneous among epiblast cells, and that endogenous cell competition refines the epiblast cell population through the elimination of cells with low relative Myc levels. These results show that natural cell competition in the early mammalian embryo contributes to the selection of the epiblast cell pool.","Claveria, Cristina; Giovinazzo, Giovanna; Sierra, Rocio; Torres, Miguel","Claveria, C; Giovinazzo, G; Sierra, R; Torres, M",39.0,"[Claveria, Cristina; Giovinazzo, Giovanna; Sierra, Rocio; Torres, Miguel] CNIC, Dept Desarrollo & Reparac Cardiovasc, E-28029 Madrid, Spain",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12389,Article,,mtorres@cnic.es,U53,"Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (MINECO); Pro-CNIC Foundation; MINECO/ISCIII TerCel [RD06/0010/0008]; Human Frontiers Science Program [RGP0008/2004]; Madrid Regional Government [S-SAL-0190-2006, P2010/BMD-2315]","We thank S.

66,136,423.0,"The initiation of plate tectonics on Earth is a critical event in our planet's history. The time lag between the first proto-subduction (about 4 billion years ago) and global tectonics (approximately 3 billion years ago) suggests that plates and plate boundaries became widespread over a period of 1 billion years. The reason for this time lag is unknown but fundamental to understanding the origin of plate tectonics. Here we suggest that when sufficient lithospheric damage (which promotes shear localization and long-lived weak zones) combines with transient mantle flow and migrating proto-subduction, it leads to the accumulation of weak plate boundaries and eventually to fully formed tectonic plates driven by subduction alone. We simulate this process using a grain evolution and damage mechanism with a composite rheology (which is compatible with field and laboratory observations of polycrystalline rocks(1,2)), coupled to an idealized model of pressure-driven lithospheric flow in which a low-pressure zone is equivalent to the suction of convective downwellings. In the simplest case, for Earth-like conditions, a few successive rotations of the driving pressure field yield relic damaged weak zones that are inherited by the lithospheric flow to forma nearly perfect plate, with passive spreading and strike-slip margins that persist and localize further, even though flow is driven only by subduction. But for hotter surface conditions, such as those on Venus, accumulation and inheritance of damage is negligible; hence only subduction zones survive and plate tectonics does not spread, which corresponds to observations. After plates have developed, continued changes in driving forces, combined with inherited damage and weak zones, promote increased tectonic complexity, such as oblique subduction, strike-slip boundaries that are subparallel to plate motion, and spalling of minor plates.","Bercovici, David; Ricard, Yanick","Bercovici, D; Ricard, Y",513.0,"[Bercovici, David] Yale Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Ricard, Yanick] Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, ENS Lyon, Lab Geol Lyon, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13072,Article,1476-4687,david.bercovici@yale.edu,+,National Science Foundation; Agence Nationale de la Recherche,"D.

67,72,371.0,"Nuclear pore complexes reside in the nuclear envelope of eukaryotic cells and mediate the nucleocytoplasmic exchange of macromolecules(1). Traffic is regulated by mobile transport receptors that target their cargo to the central translocation channel, where phenylalanine-glycine-rich repeats serve as binding sites(2). The structural analysis of the nuclear pore is a formidable challenge given its size, its location in a membranous environment and its dynamic nature. Here we have used cryo-electron tomography(3) to study the structure of nuclear pore complexes in their functional environment, that is, in intact nuclei of Dictyostelium discoideum. A new image-processing strategy compensating for deviations of the asymmetric units (protomers) from a perfect eight-fold symmetry enabled us to refine the structure and to identify new features. Furthermore, the superposition of a large number of tomograms taken in the presence of cargo, which was rendered visible by gold nanoparticles, has yielded a map outlining the trajectories of import cargo. Finally, we have performed single-molecule Monte Carlo simulations of nuclear import to interpret the experimentally observed cargo distribution in the light of existing models for nuclear import.","Beck, Martin; Lucic, Vladan; Foerster, Friedrich; Baumeister, Wolfgang; Medalia, Ohad","Beck, M; Lucic, V; Forster, F; Baumeister, W; Medalia, O",611.0,"Max Planck Inst Biochem, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06170,Article,,baumeist@biochem.mpg.de; omedalia@bgu.ac.il,615,,,216QG,,,PROTEIN IMPORT; NUCLEOCYTOPLASMIC TRANSPORT; SYSTEMS-ANALYSIS; VISUALIZATION; NUCLEOPORINS; ARCHITECTURE; REPEATS; BINDING; BETA,7162.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,"Foerster, Friedrich/0000-0002-6044-2746; Beck, Martin/0000-0002-7397-1321","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",4-Oct,5.0,LONDON,17851530.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007.0,"Foerster, Friedrich/D-3710-2009; Beck, Martin/B-5589-2011","Baumeister, W (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Biochem, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,220.0,Snapshots of nuclear pore complexes in action captured by cryo-electron tomography,2.0,48.0,WOS:000249893500048,371.0,449,Multidisciplinary Sciences,223,ohad,medalia,4760.0,22,male,1.0,uSm5jncAAAAJ,3,"(4126, 9345]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
68,196,390.0,"Fertilization of the ocean by adding iron compounds has induced diatom-dominated phytoplankton blooms accompanied by considerable carbon dioxide drawdown in the ocean surface layer. However, because the fate of bloom biomass could not be adequately resolved in these experiments, the timescales of carbon sequestration from the atmosphere are uncertain. Here we report the results of a five-week experiment carried out in the closed core of a vertically coherent, mesoscale eddy of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, during which we tracked sinking particles from the surface to the deep-sea floor. A large diatom bloom peaked in the fourth week after fertilization. This was followed by mass mortality of several diatom species that formed rapidly sinking, mucilaginous aggregates of entangled cells and chains. Taken together, multiple lines of evidence-although each with important uncertainties-lead us to conclude that at least half the bloom biomass sank far below a depth of 1,000 metres and that a substantial portion is likely to have reached the sea floor. Thus, iron-fertilized diatom blooms may sequester carbon for timescales of centuries in ocean bottom water and for longer in the sediments.","Smetacek, Victor; Klaas, Christine; Strass, Volker H.; Assmy, Philipp; Montresor, Marina; Cisewski, Boris; Savoye, Nicolas; Webb, Adrian; d'Ovidio, Francesco; Arrieta, Jesus M.; Bathmann, Ulrich; Bellerby, Richard; Berg, Gry Mine; Croot, Peter; Gonzalez, Santiago; Henjes, Joachim; Herndl, Gerhard J.; Hoffmann, Linn J.; Leach, Harry; Losch, Martin; Mills, Matthew M.; Neill, Craig; Peeken, Ilka; Roettgers, Ruediger; Sachs, Oliver; Sauter, Eberhard; Schmidt, Maike M.; Schwarz, Jill; Terbrueggen, Anja; Wolf-Gladrow, Dieter","Smetacek, V; Klaas, C; Strass, VH; Assmy, P; Montresor, M; Cisewski, B; Savoye, N; Webb, A; d'Ovidio, F; Arrieta, JM; Bathmann, U; Bellerby, R; Berg, GM; Croot, P; Gonzalez, S; Henjes, J; Herndl, GJ; Hoffmann, LJ; Leach, H; Losch, M; Mills, MM; Neill, C; Peeken, I; Rottgers, R; Sachs, O; Sauter, E; Schmidt, MM; Schwarz, J; Terbruggen, A; Wolf-Gladrow, D",313.0,"[Smetacek, Victor; Klaas, Christine; Strass, Volker H.; Assmy, Philipp; Cisewski, Boris; Bathmann, Ulrich; Henjes, Joachim; Losch, Martin; Peeken, Ilka; Sachs, Oliver; Sauter, Eberhard; Schwarz, Jill; Terbrueggen, Anja; Wolf-Gladrow, Dieter] Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, D-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany; [Smetacek, Victor] Natl Inst Oceanog, Panaji 403004, Goa, India; [Assmy, Philipp] Norwegian Polar Res Inst, Fram Ctr, N-9296 Tromso, Norway; [Montresor, Marina] Stn Zool Anton Dohrn, I-80121 Naples, Italy; [Cisewski, Boris] Johann Heinrich von Thunen Inst, Inst Sea Fisheries, D-22767 Hamburg, Germany; [Savoye, Nicolas] Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Analyt & Environm Chem, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Savoye, Nicolas] Univ Bordeaux, CNRS, EPOC, UMR 5805,Stn Marine Arcachon, F-33120 Arcachon, France; [Webb, Adrian] Univ Cape Town, Dept Oceanog, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa; [d'Ovidio, Francesco] CNRS UPMC IRD MNHN, LOCEAN IPSL, F-75252 Paris, France; [Arrieta, Jesus M.; Gonzalez, Santiago; Herndl, Gerhard J.] Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, Dept Biol Oceanog, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Netherlands; [Arrieta, Jesus M.] CSIC UIB, Inst Mediterraneo Estudios Avanzados, Dept Global Change Res, Esporles 07190, Mallorca, Spain; [Bathmann, Ulrich] Leibniz Inst Balt Sea Res Warnemunde, D-18119 Rostock, Germany; [Bellerby, Richard; Neill, Craig] Univ Bergen, Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, N-5007 Bergen, Norway; [Bellerby, Richard] Norwegian Inst Water Res, N-5006 Bergen, Norway; [Berg, Gry Mine; Mills, Matthew M.] Stanford Univ, Dept Environm Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Croot, Peter; Hoffmann, Linn J.] Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Croot, Peter] Natl Univ Ireland, Sch Nat Sci, Galway, Ireland; [Henjes, Joachim] Phytolut GmbH, D-28759 Bremen, Germany; [Herndl, Gerhard J.] Univ Vienna, Dept Marine Biol, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Leach, Harry] Univ Liverpool, Sch Environm Sci, Liverpool L69 3GP, Merseyside, England; [Neill, Craig] Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org, Wealth Oceans Flagship, Hobart, Tas 7000, Australia; [Peeken, Ilka] Univ Bremen, MARUM Ctr Marine Environm Sci, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Roettgers, Ruediger] Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Ctr Mat & Coastal Res, Inst Coastal Res, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany; [Sachs, Oliver] Eberhard & Partner AG, CH-5000 Aarau, Switzerland; [Schmidt, Maike M.] Univ Bremen, Ctr Biomol Interact Bremen, FB 2, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Schwarz, Jill] Univ Plymouth, Sch Marine Sci & Engn, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11229,Article,,victor.smetacek@awi.de; christine.klaas@awi.de,319,Cnes,"We thank C.

69,73,374.0,"One motivation in the study of development is the discovery of mechanisms that may guide evolutionary change. Here we report how development governs relative size and number of cheek teeth, or molars, in the mouse. We constructed an inhibitory cascade model by experimentally uncovering the activator-inhibitor logic of sequential tooth development. The inhibitory cascade acts as a ratchet that determines molar size differences along the jaw, one effect being that the second molar always makes up one-third of total molar area. By using a macroevolutionary test, we demonstrate the success of the model in predicting dentition patterns found among murine rodent species with various diets, thereby providing an example of ecologically driven evolution along a developmentally favoured trajectory. In general, our work demonstrates how to construct and test developmental rules with evolutionary predictability in natural systems.","Kavanagh, Kathryn D.; Evans, Alistair R.; Jernvall, Jukka","Kavanagh, KD; Evans, AR; Jernvall, J",427.0,"SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; Univ Helsinki, Inst Biotechnol, Evolut & Dev Unit, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06153,Article,,kathryn_kavanagh@yahoo.com; jernvall@fastmail.fm,U1,,,214GQ,,,EXPRESSION PATTERNS; TOOTH DEVELOPMENT; GENETIC-BASIS; LIFE-HISTORY; MOLAR TEETH; REDUCTION; MOUSE; DIFFERENTIATION; DENTITIONS; GROWTH,7161.0,NATURE,Nature,English,50.0,No,"Evans, Alistair/0000-0002-4078-4693","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",27-Sep,7.0,LONDON,17898761.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007.0,"Evans, Alistair/D-4239-2011","Kavanagh, KD (reprint author), SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,167.0,Predicting evolutionary patterns of mammalian teeth from development,11.0,53.0,WOS:000249724800033,374.0,449,Multidisciplinary Sciences,171,jukka,jernvall,8085.0,62,male,1.0,o2NAG70AAAAJ,3,"(4126, 9345]",28649402,1,28649402,1,Jukka Jernvall,Jukka Jernvall,1,1
70,216,390.0,"Milankovitch(1) proposed that Earth resides in an interglacial state when its spin axis both tilts to a high obliquity and precesses to align the Northern Hemisphere summer with Earth's nearest approach to the Sun. This general concept has been elaborated into hypotheses that precession(2), obliquity(3,4) or combinations of both(5-8) could pace deglaciations during the late Pleistocene(9,10). Earlier tests have shown that obliquity paces the late Pleistocene glacial cycles(4,11) but have been inconclusive with regard to precession, whose shorter period of about 20,000 years makes phasing more sensitive to timing errors(4,11,12). No quantitative test has provided firm evidence for a dual effect. Here I show that both obliquity and precession pace late Pleistocene glacial cycles. Deficiencies in time control that have long stymied efforts to establish orbital effects on deglaciation are overcome using a new statistical test that focuses on maxima in orbital forcing. The results are fully consistent with Milankovitch's proposal but also admit the possibility that long Southern Hemisphere summers contribute to deglaciation.","Huybers, Peter","Huybers, P",229.0,"Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10626,Article,,phuybers@fas.harvard.edu,232,,,857TR,,,GLACIAL TERMINATIONS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; INSOLATION; PALEOCLIMATE; TEMPERATURE; SOUTHERN; CYCLES; CO2,7376.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",8-Dec,4.0,LONDON,22158246.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2011.0,,"Huybers, P (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, 20 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,42.0,Combined obliquity and precession pacing of late Pleistocene deglaciations,1.0,52.0,WOS:000297744200048,390.0,480,Multidisciplinary Sciences,45,peter,huybers,4400.0,4373,male,1.0,CO3EcrgAAAAJ,3,"(4126, 9345]",25861565,1,25861565,1,Peter Huybers,Peter Huybers,1,1
71,110,398.0,"Gram-negative bacteria inhabit a broad range of ecological niches. For Escherichia coli, this includes river water as well as humans and animals, where it can be both a commensal and a pathogen(1-3). Intricate regulatory mechanisms ensure that bacteria have the right complement of beta-barrel outer membrane proteins (OMPs) to enable adaptation to a particular habitat(4,5). Yet no mechanism is known for replacing OMPs in the outer membrane, an issue that is further confounded by the lack of an energy source and the high stability(6) and abundance of OMPs(5). Here we uncover the process underpinning OMP turnover in Escherichia coli and show it to be passive and binary in nature, in which old OMPs are displaced to the poles of growing cells as new OMPs take their place. Using fluorescent colicins as OMP-specific probes, in combination with ensemble and single-molecule fluorescence microscopy in vivo and in vitro, as well as molecular dynamics simulations, we established the mechanism for binary OMP partitioning. OMPs clustered to form 0.5-mu m diameter islands, where their diffusion is restricted by promiscuous interactions with other OMPs. OMP islands were distributed throughout the cell and contained the Bam complex, which catalyses the insertion of OMPs in the outer membrane(7,8). However, OMP biogenesis occurred as a gradient that was highest at mid-cell but largely absent at cell poles. The cumulative effect is to push old OMP islands towards the poles of growing cells, leading to a binary distribution when cells divide. Hence, the outer membrane of a Gram-negative bacterium is a spatially and temporally organized structure, and this organization lies at the heart of how OMPs are turned over in the membrane.","Rassam, Patrice; Copeland, Nikki A.; Birkholz, Oliver; Toth, Csaba; Chavent, Matthieu; Duncan, Anna L.; Cross, Stephen J.; Housden, Nicholas G.; Kaminska, Renata; Seger, Urban; Quinn, Diana M.; Garrod, Tamsin J.; Sansom, Mark S.

72,141,20.0,"The life cycles of many parasites involve transitions between disparate host species, requiring these parasites to go through multiple developmental stages adapted to each of these specialized niches. Transmission of malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.) from humans to the mosquito vector requires differentiation from asexual stages replicating within red blood cells into non-dividing male and female gametocytes. Although gametocytes were first described in 1880, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in commitment to gametocyte formation is extremely limited, and disrupting this critical developmental transition remains a long-standing goal(1). Here we show that expression levels of the DNA-binding protein PfAP2-G correlate strongly with levels of gametocyte formation. Using independent forward and reverse genetics approaches, we demonstrate that PfAP2-G function is essential for parasite sexual differentiation. By combining genome-wide PfAP2-G cognate motif occurrence with global transcriptional changes resulting from PfAP2-G ablation, we identify early gametocyte genes as probable targets of PfAP2-G and show that their regulation by PfAP2-G is critical for their wild-type level expression. In the asexual blood-stage parasites pfap2-g appears to be among a set of epigenetically silenced loci(2,3) prone to spontaneous activation(4). Stochastic activation presents a simple mechanism for a low baseline of gametocyte production. Overall, these findings identify PfAP2-G as a master regulator of sexual-stage development in malaria parasites and mark the first discovery of a transcriptional switch controlling a differentiation decision in protozoan parasites.","Kafsack, Bjoern F.

73,3,53.0,"Thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) is a member of the uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) superfamily of DNA repair enzymes. Owing to its ability to excise thymine when mispaired with guanine, it was proposed to act against the mutability of 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) deamination in mammalian DNA(1). However, TDG was also found to interact with transcription factors(2,3), histone acetyltransferases(4) and de novo DNA methyltransferases(5,6), and it has been associated with DNA demethylation in gene promoters following activation of transcription(7-9), altogether implicating an engagement in gene regulation rather than DNA repair. Here we use a mouse genetic approach to determine the biological function of this multifaceted DNA repair enzyme. We find that, unlike other DNA glycosylases, TDG is essential for embryonic development, and that this phenotype is associated with epigenetic aberrations affecting the expression of developmental genes. Fibroblasts derived from Tdg null embryos (mouse embryonic fibroblasts, MEFs) show impaired gene regulation, coincident with imbalanced histone modification and CpG methylation at promoters of affected genes. TDG associates with the promoters of such genes both in fibroblasts and in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), but epigenetic aberrations only appear upon cell lineage commitment. We show that TDG contributes to the maintenance of active and bivalent chromatin throughout cell differentiation, facilitating a proper assembly of chromatin-modifying complexes and initiating base excision repair to counter aberrant de novo methylation. We thus conclude that TDG-dependent DNA repair has evolved to provide epigenetic stability in lineage committed cells.","Cortazar, Daniel; Kunz, Christophe; Selfridge, Jim; Lettieri, Teresa; Saito, Yusuke; MacDougall, Eilidh; Wirz, Annika; Schuermann, David; Jacobs, Angelika L.; Siegrist, Fredy; Steinacher, Roland; Jiricny, Josef; Bird, Adrian; Schaer, Primo","Cortazar, D; Kunz, C; Selfridge, J; Lettieri, T; Saito, Y; MacDougall, E; Wirz, A; Schuermann, D; Jacobs, AL; Siegrist, F; Steinacher, R; Jiricny, J; Bird, A; Schar, P",419.0,"[Cortazar, Daniel; Kunz, Christophe; Saito, Yusuke; Wirz, Annika; Schuermann, David; Jacobs, Angelika L.; Steinacher, Roland; Schaer, Primo] Univ Basel, Inst Biochem & Genet, Dept Biomed, CH-4048 Basel, Switzerland; [Selfridge, Jim; MacDougall, Eilidh; Bird, Adrian] Univ Edinburgh, Wellcome Trust Ctr Cell Biol, Edinburgh EH9 3JR, Midlothian, Scotland; [Lettieri, Teresa; Jiricny, Josef] Univ Zurich, Inst Mol Canc Res, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Siegrist, Fredy] F Hoffmann La Roche Ltd, Global Preclin Safety, Pharmaceut Res, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09672,Article,,primo.schaer@unibas.ch,U210,"Swiss National Science Foundation [3100A0-108436, 3100A0-122574/]; Association For International Cancer Research [01-330]","We thank D.

74,234,374.0,"Quantum metrology(1) uses tools from quantum information science to improve measurement signal-to-noise ratios. The challenge is to increase sensitivity while reducing susceptibility to noise, tasks that are often in conflict. Lock-in measurement is a detection scheme designed to overcome this difficulty by spectrally separating signal from noise. Here we report on the implementation of a quantum analogue to the classical lock-in amplifier. All the lock-in operations-modulation, detection and mixing-are performed through the application of non-commuting quantum operators to the electronic spin state of a single, trapped Sr(+) ion. We significantly increase its sensitivity to external fields while extending phase coherence by three orders of magnitude, to more than one second. Using this technique, we measure frequency shifts with a sensitivity of 0.42 Hz Hz(-1/2) (corresponding to a magnetic field measurement sensitivity of 15 pT Hz(-1/2)), obtaining an uncertainty of less than 10 mHz (350 fT) after 3,720 seconds of averaging. These sensitivities are limited by quantum projection noise and improve on other single-spin probe technologies(2,3) by two orders of magnitude. Our reported sensitivity is sufficient for the measurement of parity non-conservation(4), as well as the detection of the magnetic field of a single electronic spin one micrometre from an ion detector with nanometre resolution. As a first application, we perform light shift spectroscopy of a narrow optical quadrupole transition. Finally, we emphasize that the quantum lock-in technique is generic and can potentially enhance the sensitivity of any quantum sensor.","Kotler, Shlomi; Akerman, Nitzan; Glickman, Yinnon; Keselman, Anna; Ozeri, Roee","Kotler, S; Akerman, N; Glickman, Y; Keselman, A; Ozeri, R",61.0,"[Kotler, Shlomi; Akerman, Nitzan; Glickman, Yinnon; Keselman, Anna; Ozeri, Roee] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Phys Complex Syst, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10010,Article,,shlomi.kotler@weizmann.ac.il,65,ISF; Crown Photonics Center; Minerva Foundation,"We thank G.

75,171,181.0,"The zonal wind in the tropical stratosphere switches between prevailing easterlies and westerlies with a period of about 28 months(1). In the lowermost stratosphere, the vertical structure of this quasibiennial oscillation (QBO) is linked to the mean upwelling(2-4), which itself is a key factor in determining stratospheric composition. Evidence for changes in the QBO have until now been equivocal, raising questions as to the extent of stratospheric circulation changes in a global warming context. Here we report an analysis of near-equatorial radiosonde observations for 1953-2012, and reveal a long-term trend of weakening amplitude in the zonal wind QBO in the tropical lower stratosphere. The trend is particularly notable at the 70-hectopascal pressure level (an altitude of about 19 kilometres), where the QBO amplitudes dropped by roughly one-third over the period. This trend is also apparent in the global warming simulations of the four models in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) that realistically simulate the QBO. The weakening is most reasonably explained as resulting from a trend of increased mean tropical upwelling in the lower stratosphere. Almost all comprehensive climate models have projected an intensifying tropical upwelling in global warming scenarios(5-7), but attempts to estimate changes in the upwelling by using observational data have yielded ambiguous, inconclusive or contradictory results(8-10). Our discovery of a weakening trend in the lower-stratosphere QBO amplitude provides strong support for the existence of a long-term trend of enhanced upwelling near the tropical tropopause.","Kawatani, Yoshio; Hamilton, Kevin","Kawatani, Y; Hamilton, K",478.0,"[Kawatani, Yoshio] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Res Inst Global Change, Kanazawa Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan; [Hamilton, Kevin] Univ Hawaii Manoa, SOEST, Int Pacific Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12140,Article,,yoskawatani@jamstec.go.jp,+,"Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology through International Pacific Research Center; Ministry of the Environment, Japan [A-1201]; JSPS KAKENHI [23740363, 24340113]; NASA [NNX07AG53G]; NOAA [NA11NMF4320128]; International Pacific Research Center; Data Integration and Analysis System (DIAS) Fund for National Key Technology from MEXT","This work was supported by the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology through its support of the International Pacific Research Center, by the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (A-1201) of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan and by JSPS KAKENHI grant nos 23740363 and 24340113.

76,57,421.0,"Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death worldwide, with over one million cases annually(1). To identify genetic factors that modify disease risk, we conducted a genome- wide association study by analysing 317,139 single- nucleotide polymorphisms in 1,989 lung cancer cases and 2,625 controls from six central European countries. We identified a locus in chromosome region 15q25 that was strongly associated with lung cancer ( P= 9 x 10(-10)). This locus was replicated in five separate lung cancer studies comprising an additional 2,513 lung cancer cases and 4,752 controls ( P = 5 x 10(-20) overall), and it was found to account for 14%( attributable risk) of lung cancer cases. Statistically similar risks were observed irrespective of smoking status or propensity to smoke tobacco. The association region contains several genes, including three that encode nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits ( CHRNA5, CHRNA3 and CHRNB4). Such subunits are expressed in neurons and other tissues, in particular alveolar epithelial cells, pulmonary neuroendocrine cells and lung cancer cell lines(2,3), and they bind to N'- nitrosonornicotine and potential lung carcinogens(4). A non- synonymous variant of CHRNA5 that induces an amino acid substitution ( D398N) at a highly conserved site in the second intracellular loop of the protein is among the markers with the strongest disease associations. Our results provide compelling evidence of a locus at 15q25 predisposing to lung cancer, and reinforce interest in nicotinic acetylcholine receptors as potential disease candidates and chemopreventative targets(5).","Hung, Rayjean J.; Mckay, James D.; Gaborieau, Valerie; Boffetta, Paolo; Hashibe, Mia; Zaridze, David; Mukeria, Anush; Szeszenia-Dabrowska, Neonilia; Lissowska, Jolanta; Rudnai, Peter; Fabianova, Eleonora; Mates, Dana; Bencko, Vladimir; Foretova, Lenka; Janout, Vladimir; Chen, Chu; Goodman, Gary; Field, John K.; Liloglou, Triantafillos; Xinarianos, George; Cassidy, Adrian; McLaughlin, John; Liu, Geoffrey; Narod, Steven; Krokan, Hans E.; Skorpen, Frank; Elvestad, Maiken Bratt; Hveem, Kristian; Vatten, Lars; Linseisen, Jakob; Clavel-Chapelon, Francoise; Vineis, Paolo; Bueno-de-Mesquita, H.

77,94,141.0,"Bipolar disorder is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder that is characterized by intermittent episodes of mania and depression; without treatment, 15% of patients commit suicide(1). Hence, it has been ranked by the World Health Organization as a top disorder of morbidity and lost productivity(2). Previous neuropathological studies have revealed a series of alterations in the brains of patients with bipolar disorder or animal models', such as reduced glial cell number in the prefrontal cortex of patients(4), upregulated activities of the protein kinase A and C pathways(5-7) and changes in neurotransmission(8-11). However, the roles and causation of these changes in bipolar disorder have been too complex to exactly determine the pathology of the disease. Furthermore, although some patients show remarkable improvement with lithium treatment for yet unknown reasons, others are refractory to lithium treatment. Therefore, developing an accurate and powerful biological model for bipolar disorder has been a challenge. The introduction of induced pluripotent stem-cell (iPSC) technology has provided a new approach. Here we have developed an iPSC model for human bipolar disorder and investigated the cellular phenotypes of hippocampal dentate gyrus-like neurons derived from iPSCs of patients with bipolar disorder. Guided by RNA sequencing expression profiling, we have detected mitochondrial abnormalities in young neurons from patients with bipolar disorder by using mitochondrial assays; in addition, using both patch-clamp recording and somatic Ca2+ imaging, we have observed hyperactive action-potential firing. This hyperexcitability phenotype of young neurons in bipolar disorder was selectively reversed by lithium treatment only in neurons derived from patients who also responded to lithium treatment. Therefore, hyperexcitability is one early endophenotype of bipolar disorder, and our model of iPSCs in this disease might be useful in developing new therapies and drugs aimed at its clinical treatment.","Mertens, Jerome; Wang, Qiu-Wen; Kim, Yongsung; Yu, Diana X.; Pham, Son; Yang, Bo; Zheng, Yi; Diffenderfer, Kenneth E.; Zhang, Jian; Soltani, Sheila; Eames, Tameji; Schafer, Simon T.; Boyer, Leah; Marchetto, Maria C.; Nurnberger, John I.; Calabrese, Joseph R.; Odegaard, Ketil J.; McCarthy, Michael J.; Zandi, Peter P.; Alba, Martin; Nievergelt, Caroline M.; Mi, Shuangli; Brennand, Kristen J.; Kelsoe, John R.; Gage, Fred H.; Yao, Jun","Mertens, J; Wang, QW; Kim, Y; Yu, DX; Pham, S; Yang, B; Zheng, Y; Diffenderfer, KE; Zhang, J; Soltani, S; Eames, T; Schafer, ST; Boyer, L; Marchetto, MC; Nurnberger, JI; Calabrese, JR; Odegaard, KJ; McCarthy, MJ; Zandi, PP; Alba, M; Nievergelt, CM; Mi, SL; Brennand, KJ; Kelsoe, JR; Gage, FH; Yao, J",95.0,"[Mertens, Jerome; Wang, Qiu-Wen; Yang, Bo; Zheng, Yi; Yao, Jun] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Life Sci, McGovern Inst Brain Res, State Key Lab Membrane Biol,Tsinghua Peking Joint, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Mertens, Jerome; Kim, Yongsung; Yu, Diana X.; Pham, Son; Soltani, Sheila; Eames, Tameji; Schafer, Simon T.; Boyer, Leah; Marchetto, Maria C.; Gage, Fred H.; Yao, Jun] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Genet Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Diffenderfer, Kenneth E.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Stem Cell Core, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Zhang, Jian; Mi, Shuangli] Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing Inst Genom, Key Lab Genom & Precis Med, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Nurnberger, John I.] Indiana Univ, Dept Psychiat, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Calabrese, Joseph R.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Psychiat, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Odegaard, Ketil J.] Univ Bergen, Dept Psychiat, N-5020 Bergen, Norway; [McCarthy, Michael J.; Kelsoe, John R.] VA San Diego Healthcare Syst, Dept Psychiat, La Jolla, CA 92151 USA; [McCarthy, Michael J.; Nievergelt, Caroline M.; Kelsoe, John R.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Psychiat, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Zandi, Peter P.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Psychiat, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Alba, Martin] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Psychiat, Halifax, NS B3H 2E2, Canada; [Brennand, Kristen J.] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Yao, Jun] Jiangsu Normal Univ, Jiangsu Collaborat Innovat Ctr Language Abil, Xuzhou 221009, Peoples R China",Pharmacogenomics Bipolar Disorder,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15526,Article,1476-4687,jkelsoe@ucsd.edu; gage@salk.edu; jyao@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn,99,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [31471020, 31161120358, 31123004]; National Basic Research Program of China [2015CB910603, 2011CB510106]; Key Laboratory of Genomic and Precision Medicine, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Engmann Foundation; JPB Foundation; Helmsley Trust; Mather's Foundation; Glenn Foundation for Aging Research; National Institute of Health [MH106056]; New York Stem Cell Foundation - Robertson Award; National Institute of Mental Health [U01 MH92758]; Department of Veterans Affairs [5I01CX000363]","We thank the patients who participated in this study.

78,129,320.0,"Efficient duplication of the genome requires the concerted action of helicase and DNA polymerases at replication forks(1) to avoid stalling of the replication machinery and consequent genomic instability(2-4). In eukaryotes, the physical coupling between helicase and DNA polymerases remains poorly understood. Here we define the molecular mechanism by which the yeast Ctf4 protein links the Cdc45-MCM-GINS(CMG) DNA helicase to DNA polymerase alpha (Pol alpha) within the replisome. We use X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy to show that Ctf4 self-associates in a constitutive disk-shaped trimer. Trimerization depends on a beta-propeller domain in the carboxy-terminal half of the protein, which is fused to a helical extension that protrudes from one face of the trimeric disk. Critically, Pol alpha and the CMG helicase share a common mechanism of interaction with Ctf4. We show that the amino-terminal tails of the catalytic subunit of Pol alpha and the Sld5 subunit of GINS contain a conserved Ctf4-binding motif that docks onto the exposed helical extension of a Ctf4 protomer within the trimer. Accordingly, we demonstrate that one Ctf4 trimer can support binding of up to three partner proteins, including the simultaneous association with both Pol a and GINS. Our findings indicate that Ctf4 can couple two molecules of Pol alpha to one CMG helicase within the replisome, providing a new model for lagging-strand synthesis in eukaryotes that resembles the emerging model for the simpler replisome of Escherichia coli(5-8). The ability of Ctf4 to act as a platform for multivalent interactions illustrates a mechanism for the concurrent recruitment of factors that act together at the fork.","Simon, Aline C.; Zhou, Jin C.; Perera, Rajika L.; van Deursen, Frederick; Evrin, Cecile; Ivanova, Marina E.; Kilkenny, Mairi L.; Renault, Ludovic; Kjaer, Svend; Matak-Vinkovic, Dijana; Labib, Karim; Costa, Alessandro; Pellegrini, Luca","Simon, AC; Zhou, JC; Perera, RL; van Deursen, F; Evrin, C; Ivanova, ME; Kilkenny, ML; Renault, L; Kjaer, S; Matak-Vinkovic, D; Labib, K; Costa, A; Pellegrini, L",293.0,"[Simon, Aline C.; Perera, Rajika L.; Ivanova, Marina E.; Kilkenny, Mairi L.; Pellegrini, Luca] Univ Cambridge, Dept Biochem, Cambridge CB2 1GA, England; [Zhou, Jin C.; Renault, Ludovic; Costa, Alessandro] Canc Res UK London Res Inst, Clare Hall Labs, London EN6 3LD, England; [van Deursen, Frederick] Univ Manchester, Canc Res UK Manchester Inst, Manchester M20 4BX, Lancs, England; [Evrin, Cecile; Labib, Karim] Univ Dundee, Coll Life Sci, MRC Prot Phosphorylat & Ubiquitylat Unit, Dundee DD1 5EH, Scotland; [Kjaer, Svend] Canc Res UK London Res Inst, London WC2A 3LY, England; [Matak-Vinkovic, Dijana] Univ Cambridge, Dept Chem, Cambridge CB2 1EW, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13234,Article,1476-4687,alessandro.costa@cancer.org.uk; lp212@cam.ac.uk,+,Gates Cambridge PhD program; CRUK; MRC; Wellcome Trust SRF award in basic biomedical science,"We would like to thank L.

79,51,285.0,"Malaria parasites and related Apicomplexans are the causative agents of the some of the most serious infectious diseases of humans, companion animals, livestock and wildlife. These parasites must undergo sexual reproduction to transmit from vertebrate hosts to vectors, and their sex ratios are consistently female- biased. Sex allocation theory, a cornerstone of evolutionary biology, is remarkably successful at explaining female- biased sex ratios in multicellular taxa, but has proved controversial when applied to malaria parasites. Here we show that, as predicted by theory, sex ratio is an important fitness- determining trait and Plasmodium chabaudi parasites adjust their sex allocation in response to the presence of unrelated conspecifics. This suggests that P. chabaudi parasites use kin discrimination to evaluate the genetic diversity of their infections, and they adjust their behaviour in response to environmental cues. Malaria parasites provide a novel way to test evolutionary theory, and support the generality and power of a darwinian approach.","Reece, Sarah E.; Drew, Damien R.; Gardner, Andy","Reece, SE; Drew, DR; Gardner, A",609.0,"[Reece, Sarah E.; Gardner, Andy] Univ Edinburgh, Inst Evolut Biol, Ashworth Labs, Sch Biol Sci, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland; [Reece, Sarah E.; Drew, Damien R.] Univ Edinburgh, Inst Immunol & Infect Res, Ashworth Labs, Sch Biol Sci, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland; [Drew, Damien R.] Walter & Eliza Hall Inst Med Res, Ctr Biotechnol, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06954,Article,1476-4687,sarah.reece@ed.ac.uk,U1,Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council; Wellcome Trust,,305NN,,,LOCAL MATE COMPETITION; PLASMODIUM-FALCIPARUM; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; TOXOPLASMA-GONDII; BLOOD PARASITES; PREMATURE REJECTION; FERTILITY INSURANCE; EVOLUTION; VIRULENCE; TRANSMISSION,7195.0,NATURE,Nature,English,50.0,No,"Reece, Sarah/0000-0001-6716-6732; Gardner, Andy/0000-0002-1304-3734","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",29-May,7.0,LONDON,18509435.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,"Reece, Sarah/C-9447-2009; Gardner, Andy/K-5353-2013","Reece, SE (reprint author), Univ Edinburgh, Inst Evolut Biol, Ashworth Labs, Sch Biol Sci, W Mains Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,117.0,Sex ratio adjustment and kin discrimination in malaria parasites,1.0,32.0,WOS:000256185200034,285.0,453,Multidisciplinary Sciences,121,andy,gardner,9271.0,3139,male,0.95,WQrZYMIAAAAJ,3,"(4126, 9345]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
80,83,301.0,"Epithelial tissues maintain a robust architecture during development. This fundamental property relies on intercellular adhesion through the formation of adherens junctions containing E-cadherin molecules(1,2). Localization of E-cadherin is stabilized through a pathway involving the recruitment of actin filaments by E-cadherin(3-6). Here we identify an additional pathway that organizes actin filaments in the apical junctional region (AJR) where adherens junctions form in embryonic epithelia. This pathway is controlled by Bitesize (Btsz), a synaptotagmin-like protein(7,8) that is recruited in the AJR independently of E-cadherin and is required for epithelial stability in Drosophila embryos. On loss of btsz, E-cadherin is recruited normally to the AJR, but is not stabilized properly and actin filaments fail to form a stable continuous network. In the absence of E-cadherin, actin filaments are stable for a longer time than they are in btsz mutants. We identify two polarized cues that localize Btsz: phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate, to which Btsz binds; and Par-3. We show that Btsz binds to the Ezrin - Radixin - Moesin protein Moesin, an F-actin-binding protein that is localized apically(9) and is recruited in the AJR in a btsz-dependent manner. Expression of a dominant-negative form of Ezrin that does not bind F-actin phenocopies the loss of btsz. Thus, our data indicate that, through their interaction, Btsz and Moesin may mediate the proper organization of actin in a local domain, which in turn stabilizes E-cadherin. These results provide a mechanism for the spatial order of actin organization underlying junction stabilization in primary embryonic epithelia.","Pilot, Fanny; Philippe, Jean-Marc; Lemmers, Celine; Lecuit, Thomas","Pilot, F; Philippe, JM; Lemmers, C; Lecuit, T",580.0,"Univ Mediterrannee, CNRS, UMR 6216, Inst Biol Dev Marseille Luminy, F-13288 Marseille 09, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature04935,Article,,lecuit@ibdm.univ-mrs.fr,584,,,069NQ,,,DROSOPHILA E-CADHERIN; EPITHELIAL-CELLS; POLARITY; MORPHOGENESIS; ARMADILLO; ADHESION; REARRANGEMENT; NEUROBLASTS; MECHANISMS; OOGENESIS,7102.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",3-Aug,5.0,LONDON,16862128.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,,"Lecuit, T (reprint author), Univ Mediterrannee, CNRS, UMR 6216, Inst Biol Dev Marseille Luminy, Campus Luminy,Case 907, F-13288 Marseille 09, France.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,84.0,Spatial control of actin organization at adherens junctions by the synaptotagmin-like protein Btsz,1.0,6.0,WOS:000239455900047,301.0,442,Multidisciplinary Sciences,85,thomas,lecuit,7459.0,3753,male,1.0,K4EMassAAAAJ,3,"(4126, 9345]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
81,56,409.0,"There exists controversy over the nature of haematopoietic progenitors of T cells. Most T cells develop in the thymus, but the lineage potential of thymus-colonizing progenitors is unknown. One approach to resolving this question is to determine the lineage potentials of the earliest thymic progenitors (ETPs). Previous work has shown that ETPs possess T and natural killer lymphoid potentials, and rare subsets of ETPs also possess B lymphoid potential(1), suggesting an origin from lymphoid-restricted progenitor cells. However, whether ETPs also possess myeloid potential is unknown. Here we show that nearly all ETPs in adult mice possess both T and myeloid potential in clonal assays. The existence of progenitors possessing T and myeloid potential within the thymus is incompatible with the current dominant model of haematopoiesis, in which T cells are proposed to arise from lymphoid-restricted progenitors(2). Our results indicate that alternative models for lineage commitment during haematopoiesis must be considered.","Bell, J. Jeremiah; Bhandoola, Avinash","Bell, JJ; Bhandoola, A",764.0,"[Bell, J.

82,126,263.0,"Galaxies are believed to evolve through merging(1), which should lead to some hosting multiple supermassive black holes(2-4). There are four known triple black hole systems(5-8), with the closest black hole pair being 2.4 kiloparsecs apart (the third component in this system is at 3 kiloparsecs)(7), which is far from the gravitational sphere of influence (about 100 parsecs for a black hole with mass one billion times that of the Sun). Previous searches for compact black hole systems concluded that they were rare(9), with the tightest binary system having a separation of 7 parsecs (ref. 10). Here we report observations of a triple black hole system at redshift z = 0.39, with the closest pair separated by about 140 parsecs and significantly more distant from Earth than any other known binary of comparable orbital separation. The effect of the tight pair is to introduce a rotationally symmetric helical modulation on the structure of the large-scale radio jets, which provides a useful way to search for other tight pairs without needing extremely high resolution observations. As we found this tight pair after searching only six galaxies, we conclude that tight pairs are more common than hitherto believed, which is an important observational constraint for low-frequency gravitational wave experiments(11,12).","Deane, R.

83,101,239.0,"Following the discovery of BRD4 as a non-oncogene addiction target in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)(1,2), bromodomain and extra terminal protein (BET) inhibitors are being explored as a promising therapeutic avenue in numerous cancers(3-5). While clinical trials have reported single-agent activity in advanced haematological malignancies(6), mechanisms determining the response to BET inhibition remain poorly understood. To identify factors involved in primary and acquired BET resistance in leukaemia, here we perform a chromatin-focused RNAi screen in a sensitive MLL-AF9; Nras(G12D)-driven AML mouse model, and investigate dynamic transcriptional profiles in sensitive and resistantmouse and human leukaemias. Our screen shows that suppression of the PRC2 complex, contrary to effects in other contexts, promotes BET inhibitor resistance in AML. PRC2 suppression does not directly affect the regulation of Brd4-dependent transcripts, but facilitates the remodelling of regulatory pathways that restore the transcription of key targets such as Myc. Similarly, while BET inhibition triggers acute MYC repression in human leukaemias regardless of their sensitivity, resistant leukaemias are uniformly characterized by their ability to rapidly restore MYC transcription. This process involves the activation and recruitment of WNT signalling components, which compensate for the loss of BRD4 and drive resistance in various cancer models. Dynamic chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing of enhancer profiles reveal that BET-resistant states are characterized by remodelled regulatory landscapes, involving the activation of a focal MYC enhancer that recruits WNT machinery in response to BET inhibition. Together, our results identify and validate WNT signalling as a driver and candidate biomarker of primary and acquired BET resistance in leukaemia, and implicate the rewiring of transcriptional programs as an important mechanism promoting resistance to BET inhibitors and, potentially, other chromatin-targeted therapies.","Rathert, Philipp; Roth, Mareike; Neumann, Tobias; Muerdter, Felix; Roe, Jae-Seok; Muhar, Matthias; Deswal, Sumit; Cerny-Reiterer, Sabine; Peter, Barbara; Jude, Julian; Hoffmann, Thomas; Boryn, Lukasz M.; Axelsson, Elin; Schweifer, Norbert; Tontsch-Grunt, Ulrike; Dow, Lukas E.; Gianni, Davide; Pearson, Mark; Valent, Peter; Stark, Alexander; Kraut, Norbert; Vakoc, Christopher R.; Zuber, Johannes","Rathert, P; Roth, M; Neumann, T; Muerdter, F; Roe, JS; Muhar, M; Deswal, S; Cerny-Reiterer, S; Peter, B; Jude, J; Hoffmann, T; Boryn, LM; Axelsson, E; Schweifer, N; Tontsch-Grunt, U; Dow, LE; Gianni, D; Pearson, M; Valent, P; Stark, A; Kraut, N; Vakoc, CR; Zuber, J",543.0,"[Rathert, Philipp; Roth, Mareike; Neumann, Tobias; Muerdter, Felix; Muhar, Matthias; Deswal, Sumit; Jude, Julian; Hoffmann, Thomas; Boryn, Lukasz M.; Axelsson, Elin; Stark, Alexander; Zuber, Johannes] Vienna Bioctr VBC, Res Inst Mol Pathol IMP, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Roe, Jae-Seok; Vakoc, Christopher R.] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; [Cerny-Reiterer, Sabine; Peter, Barbara; Valent, Peter] Med Univ Vienna, Div Hematol & Hemostaseol, Dept Internal Med 1, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Cerny-Reiterer, Sabine; Peter, Barbara; Valent, Peter] Med Univ Vienna, Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncol, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Schweifer, Norbert; Tontsch-Grunt, Ulrike; Gianni, Davide; Pearson, Mark; Kraut, Norbert] Boehringer Ingelheim Reg Ctr Vienna GmbH, A-1121 Vienna, Austria; [Dow, Lukas E.] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Med Hematol & Med Oncol, New York, NY 10065 USA",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14898,Article,1476-4687,zuber@imp.ac.at,+,"European Research Council (ERC) [336860]; SFB of the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [F4704, F4710]; European Union; ERC [242922]; Boehringer Ingelheim","We thank M.

84,185,196.0,"The morphological and functional development of the vertebrate nervous system is initially governed by genetic factors and subsequently refined by neuronal activity. However, fundamental features of the nervous system emerge before sensory experience is possible. Thus, activity-dependent development occurring before the onset of experience must be driven by spontaneous activity, but the origin and nature of activity in vivo remains largely untested. Here we use optical methods to show in live neonatal mice that waves of spontaneous retinal activity are present and propagate throughout the entire visual system before eye opening. This patterned activity encompassed the visual field, relied on cholinergic neurotransmission, preferentially initiated in the binocular retina and exhibited spatiotemporal correlations between the two hemispheres. Retinal waves were the primary source of activity in the midbrain and primary visual cortex, but only modulated ongoing activity in secondary visual areas. Thus, spontaneous retinal activity is transmitted through the entire visual system and carries patterned information capable of guiding the activity-dependent development of complex intra-and inter-hemispheric circuits before the onset of vision.","Ackman, James B.; Burbridge, Timothy J.; Crair, Michael C.","Ackman, JB; Burbridge, TJ; Crair, MC",219.0,"[Ackman, James B.; Burbridge, Timothy J.; Crair, Michael C.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, New Haven, CT 06510 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11529,Article,,michael.crair@yale.edu,+,"US National Institutes of Health (NIH) [P30 EY000785, R01 EY015788, T32 NS007224, T15 LM070506, T32 EY017353]; family of William Ziegler III","We thank R.

85,24,167.0,"Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are transcriptional repressors that control processes ranging from the maintenance of cell fate decisions and stem cell pluripotency in animals to the control of flowering time in plants(1-6). In Drosophila, genetic studies identified more than 15 different PcG proteins that are required to repress homeotic (HOX) and other developmental regulator genes in cells where they must stay inactive(1,7,8). Biochemical analyses established that these PcG proteins exist in distinct multiprotein complexes that bind to and modify chromatin of target genes(1-4). Among those, Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) and the related dRing-associated factors (dRAF) complex contain an E3 ligase activity for monoubiquitination of histone H2A (refs 1-4). Here we show that the uncharacterized Drosophila PcG gene calypso encodes the ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase BAP1. Biochemically purified Calypso exists in a complex with the PcG protein ASX, and this complex, named Polycomb repressive deubiquitinase (PR-DUB), is bound at PcG target genes in Drosophila. Reconstituted recombinant Drosophila and human PR-DUB complexes remove monoubiquitin from H2A but not from H2B in nucleosomes. Drosophila mutants lacking PR-DUB show a strong increase in the levels of monoubiquitinated H2A. A mutation that disrupts the catalytic activity of Calypso, or absence of the ASX subunit abolishes H2A deubiquitination in vitro and HOX gene repression in vivo. Polycomb gene silencing may thus entail adynamic balance between H2A ubiquitination by PRC1 and dRAF, and H2A deubiquitination by PR-DUB.","Scheuermann, Johanna C.; Alonso, Andres Gaytan de Ayala; Oktaba, Katarzyna; Ly-Hartig, Nga; McGinty, Robert K.; Fraterman, Sven; Wilm, Matthias; Muir, Tom W.; Mueller, Juerg","Scheuermann, JC; Alonso, AGD; Oktaba, K; Ly-Hartig, N; McGinty, RK; Fraterman, S; Wilm, M; Muir, TW; Muller, J",243.0,"[Scheuermann, Johanna C.; Alonso, Andres Gaytan de Ayala; Oktaba, Katarzyna; Ly-Hartig, Nga; Fraterman, Sven; Wilm, Matthias; Mueller, Juerg] European Mol Biol Lab, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [McGinty, Robert K.; Muir, Tom W.] Rockefeller Univ, New York, NY 10065 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08966,Article,,juerg.mueller@embl.de,U138,NIH [RC2CA148354]; EMBL; DFG,"We thank T.

86,74,391.0,"The Plio-Pleistocene site of Dmanisi, Georgia, has yielded a rich fossil and archaeological record documenting an early presence of the genus Homo outside Africa. Although the craniomandibular morphology of early Homo is well known as a result of finds from Dmanisi and African localities, data about its postcranial morphology are still relatively scarce. Here we describe newly excavated postcranial material from Dmanisi comprising a partial skeleton of an adolescent individual, associated with skull D2700/D2735, and the remains from three adult individuals. This material shows that the postcranial anatomy of the Dmanisi hominins has a surprising mosaic of primitive and derived features. The primitive features include a small body size, a low encephalization quotient and absence of humeral torsion; the derived features include modern-human-like body proportions and lower limb morphology indicative of the capability for long-distance travel. Thus, the earliest known hominins to have lived outside of Africa in the temperate zones of Eurasia did not yet display the full set of derived skeletal features.","Lordkipanidze, David; Jashashvili, Tea; Vekua, Abesalom; de Leon, Marcia S.

87,158,421.0,"Groundwater drawn daily from shallow alluvial sands by millions of wells over large areas of south and southeast Asia exposes an estimated population of over a hundred million people to toxic levels of arsenic(1). Holocene aquifers are the source of widespread arsenic poisoning across the region(2,3). In contrast, Pleistocene sands deposited in this region more than 12,000 years ago mostly do not host groundwater with high levels of arsenic. Pleistocene aquifers are increasingly used as a safe source of drinking water(4) and it is therefore important to understand under what conditions low levels of arsenic can be maintained. Here we reconstruct the initial phase of contamination of a Pleistocene aquifer near Hanoi, Vietnam. We demonstrate that changes in groundwater flow conditions and the redox state of the aquifer sands induced by groundwater pumping caused the lateral intrusion of arsenic contamination more than 120 metres from a Holocene aquifer into a previously uncontaminated Pleistocene aquifer. We also find that arsenic adsorbs onto the aquifer sands and that there is a 16-20-fold retardation in the extent of the contamination relative to the reconstructed lateral movement of groundwater over the same period. Our findings suggest that arsenic contamination of Pleistocene aquifers in south and southeast Asia as a consequence of increasing levels of groundwater pumping may have been delayed by the retardation of arsenic transport.","van Geen, Alexander; Bostick, Benjamin C.; Pham Thi Kim Trang; Vi Mai Lan; Nguyen-Ngoc Mai; Phu Dao Manh; Pham Hung Viet; Radloff, Kathleen; Aziz, Zahid; Mey, Jacob L.; Stahl, Mason O.; Harvey, Charles F.; Oates, Peter; Weinman, Beth; Stengel, Caroline; Frei, Felix; Kipfer, Rolf; Berg, Michael","van Geen, A; Bostick, BC; Trang, PTK; Lan, VM; Mai, NN; Manh, PD; Viet, PH; Radloff, K; Aziz, Z; Mey, JL; Stahl, MO; Harvey, CF; Oates, P; Weinman, B; Stengel, C; Frei, F; Kipfer, R; Berg, M",204.0,"[van Geen, Alexander; Bostick, Benjamin C.; Radloff, Kathleen; Aziz, Zahid; Mey, Jacob L.] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Pham Thi Kim Trang; Vi Mai Lan; Nguyen-Ngoc Mai; Phu Dao Manh; Pham Hung Viet] Vietnam Natl Univ, Hanoi Univ Sci, Res Ctr Environm Technol & Sustainable Dev CETASD, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Mey, Jacob L.] Kingsborough Community Coll, Dept Phys Sci, Brooklyn, NY 11235 USA; [Stahl, Mason O.; Harvey, Charles F.] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Oates, Peter] Anchor QEA, Montvale, NJ 07645 USA; [Weinman, Beth] Vanderbilt Univ, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Stengel, Caroline; Frei, Felix; Kipfer, Rolf; Berg, Michael] Eawag, Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Kipfer, Rolf] Zurich ETHZ, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Geochem & Petrol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12444,Article,1476-4687,avangeen@ldeo.columbia.edu,+,"NSF [EAR 09-11557]; Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation [NAFOSTED 105-09-59-09]; NIEHS [P42 ES010349, P42 ES016454]","This study was supported by NSF grant EAR 09-11557, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, grant NAFOSTED 105-09-59-09 to CETASD, and NIEHS grants P42 ES010349 and P42 ES016454.

88,194,316.0,"Cancer genome sequencing provides the first direct information on how mutation rates vary across the human genome in somatic cells(1-7). Testing diverse genetic and epigenetic features, here we show that mutation rates in cancer genomes are strikingly related to chromatin organization. Indeed, at the megabase scale, a single feature-levels of the heterochromatin-associated histone modification H3K9me3-can account for more than 40% of mutation-rate variation, and a combination of features can account for more than 55%. The strong association between mutation rates and chromatin organization is upheld in samples from different tissues and for different mutation types. This suggests that the arrangement of the genome into heterochromatin- and euchromatin-like domains is a dominant influence on regional mutation-rate variation in human somatic cells.","Schuster-Boeckler, Benjamin; Lehner, Ben","Schuster-Bockler, B; Lehner, B",504.0,"[Schuster-Boeckler, Benjamin; Lehner, Ben] CRG, EMBL CRG Syst Biol Unit, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Schuster-Boeckler, Benjamin; Lehner, Ben] UPF, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Schuster-Boeckler, Benjamin] Pear Comp LLP, London W5 1SH, England; [Lehner, Ben] Passeig Lluis Co 23, ICREA, Barcelona 08010, Spain",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11273,Article,1476-4687,ben.lehner@crg.es,+,"European Research Council (ERC); European Union [277899 4DCellFate]; ERASysBioPLUS; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion (MICINN) [BFU2008-00365, BFU2011-26206]; Agencia de Gestio d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca (AGAUR); European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO); EMBL-CRG Systems Biology Program; Juan de la Cierva postdoctoral fellowship; ICREA","This work was funded by an European Research Council (ERC) Starting Grant, European Union Framework 7 project 277899 4DCellFate, ERASysBioPLUS, Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion (MICINN) grants BFU2008-00365 and BFU2011-26206, Agencia de Gestio d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca (AGAUR), the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) Young Investigator Program, the EMBL-CRG Systems Biology Program and a Juan de la Cierva postdoctoral fellowship to B.S-B.

90,95,154.0,"Ice flow along land-terminating margins of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) varies considerably in response to fluctuating inputs of surface meltwater to the bed of the ice sheet. Such inputs lubricate the ice-bed interface, transiently speeding up the flow of ice(1,2). Greater melting results in faster ice motion during summer, but slower motion over the subsequent winter, owing to the evolution of an efficient drainage system that enables water to drain from regions of the ice-sheet bed that have a high basal water pressure(2,3). However, the impact of hydrodynamic coupling on ice motion over decadal timescales remains poorly constrained. Here we show that annual ice motion across an 8,000-km(2) land-terminating region of the west GIS margin, extending to 1,100 m above sea level, was 12% slower in 2007-14 compared with 198594, despite a 50% increase in surface meltwater production. Our findings suggest that, over these three decades, hydrodynamic coupling in this section of the ablation zone resulted in a net slow-down of ice motion (not a speed-up, as previously postulated(1)). Increases in meltwater production from projected climate warming may therefore further reduce the motion of land-terminating margins of the GIS. Our findings suggest that these sectors of the ice sheet are more resilient to the dynamic impacts of enhanced meltwater production than previously thought.","Tedstone, Andrew J.; Nienow, Peter W.; Gourmelen, Noel; Dehecq, Amaury; Goldberg, Daniel; Hanna, Edward","Tedstone, AJ; Nienow, PW; Gourmelen, N; Dehecq, A; Goldberg, D; Hanna, E",692.0,"[Tedstone, Andrew J.; Nienow, Peter W.; Gourmelen, Noel; Dehecq, Amaury; Goldberg, Daniel] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH8 9XP, Midlothian, Scotland; [Dehecq, Amaury] Univ Savoie Mt Blanc, Polytech Annecy Chambery, LISTIC, F-74944 Annecy Le Vieux, France; [Hanna, Edward] Univ Sheffield, Dept Geog, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15722,Article,1476-4687,a.j.tedstone@ed.ac.uk,695,"UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/152830X/1, NE/J500021/1]; Scottish Alliance for Geoscience, Environment and Society (SAGES) Postdoctoral/Early Career Researcher Exchange (PECRE) award; University of Edinburgh GeoSciences Moss scholarship; European Space Agency Dragon 3 [10302]; Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales","A.J.T. acknowledges UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) studentships NE/152830X/1 and NE/J500021/1, a Scottish Alliance for Geoscience, Environment and Society (SAGES) Postdoctoral/Early Career Researcher Exchange (PECRE) award, and a University of Edinburgh GeoSciences Moss scholarship.

91,226,161.0,"Modern computing technology is based on writing, storing and retrieving information encoded as magnetic bits. Although the giant magnetoresistance effect has improved the electrical read out of memory elements, magnetic writing remains the object of major research efforts(1). Despite several reports of methods to reverse the polarity of nanosized magnets by means of local electric fields(2,3) and currents(4-6), the simple reversal of a high-coercivity, single-layer ferromagnet remains a challenge. Materials with large coercivity and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy represent the mainstay of data storage media, owing to their ability to retain a stable magnetization state over long periods of time and their amenability to miniaturization(7). However, the same anisotropy properties that make a material attractive for storage also make it hard to write to(8). Here we demonstrate switching of a perpendicularly magnetized cobalt dot driven by in-plane current injection at room temperature. Our device is composed of a thin cobalt layer with strong perpendicular anisotropy and Rashba interaction induced by asymmetric platinum and AlO(x) interface layers(9,10). The effective switching field is orthogonal to the direction of the magnetization and to the Rashba field. The symmetry of the switching field is consistent with the spin accumulation induced by the Rashba interaction and the spin-dependent mobility observed in non-magnetic semiconductors(11,12), as well as with the torque induced by the spin Hall effect in the platinum layer(13,14). Our measurements indicate that the switching efficiency increases with the magnetic anisotropy of the cobalt layer and the oxidation of the aluminium layer, which is uppermost, suggesting that the Rashba interaction has a key role in the reversal mechanism. To prove the potential of in-plane current switching for spintronic applications, we construct a reprogrammable magnetic switch that can be integrated into non-volatile memory and logic architectures. This device is simple, scalable and compatible with present-day magnetic recording technology.","Mihai Miron, Ioan; Garello, Kevin; Gaudin, Gilles; Zermatten, Pierre-Jean; Costache, Marius V.; Auffret, Stephane; Bandiera, Sebastien; Rodmacq, Bernard; Schuhl, Alain; Gambardella, Pietro","Miron, IM; Garello, K; Gaudin, G; Zermatten, PJ; Costache, MV; Auffret, S; Bandiera, S; Rodmacq, B; Schuhl, A; Gambardella, P",189.0,"[Mihai Miron, Ioan; Garello, Kevin; Costache, Marius V.; Gambardella, Pietro] Catalan Inst Nanotechnol ICN CIN2, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Gaudin, Gilles; Zermatten, Pierre-Jean; Auffret, Stephane; Bandiera, Sebastien; Rodmacq, Bernard; Schuhl, Alain] INAC, CEA CNRS UJF GINP, UMR 8191, SPINTEC, F-38054 Grenoble, France; [Gambardella, Pietro] ICREA, E-08010 Barcelona, Spain; [Gambardella, Pietro] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Fis, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10309,Article,,mihai.miron.icn@uab.es; pietro.gambardella.icn@uab.es,U88,"European Research Council [StG 203239 NOMAD]; Ministerio de Ciencia y Innovacion [ERA-Net EUI2008-03884, MAT2010-15659]; Agencia de Gestio d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca [2009 SGR 695]; ICREA","We thank S.

92,146,232.0,"Brown adipose tissue (BAT) dissipates chemical energy in the form of heat as a defence against hypothermia and obesity. Current evidence indicates that brown adipocytes arise from Myf5(+) dermotomal precursors through the action of PR domain containing protein 16 (PRDM16) transcriptional complex(1,2). However, the enzymatic component of the molecular switch that determines lineage specification of brown adipocytes remains unknown. Here we show that euchromatic histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 1 (EHMT1) is an essential BAT-enriched lysine methyltransferase in the PRDM16 transcriptional complex and controls brown adipose cell fate. Loss of EHMT1 in brown adipocytes causes a severe loss of brown fat characteristics and induces muscle differentiation in vivo through demethylation of histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2 and 3) of the muscle-selective gene promoters. Conversely, EHMT1 expression positively regulates the BAT-selective thermogenic program by stabilizing the PRDM16 protein. Notably, adipose-specific deletion of EHMT1 leads to a marked reduction of BAT-mediated adaptive thermogenesis, obesity and systemic insulin resistance. These data indicate that EHMT1 is an essential enzymatic switch that controls brown adipose cell fate and energy homeostasis.","Ohno, Haruya; Shinoda, Kosaku; Ohyama, Kana; Sharp, Louis Z.; Kajimura, Shingo","Ohno, H; Shinoda, K; Ohyama, K; Sharp, LZ; Kajimura, S",163.0,"[Ohno, Haruya; Shinoda, Kosaku; Ohyama, Kana; Sharp, Louis Z.; Kajimura, Shingo] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Cell & Tissue Biol, UCSF Diabet Ctr, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12652,Article,1476-4687,skajimura@diabetes.ucsf.edu,+,"National Institutes of Health [DK087853, DK97441]; DERC center [DK63720]; University of California, San Francisco Program for Breakthrough Biomedical Research program; Pew Charitable Trust; PRESTO from the Japan Science and Technology Agency; Manpei Suzuki Diabetes Foundation; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","We are grateful to A.

93,42,52.0,"Maintenance of the blood system is dependent on dormant haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with long-term self-renewal capacity. After injury these cells are induced to proliferate to quickly reestablish homeostasis(1). The signalling molecules promoting the exit of HSCs out of the dormant stage remain largely unknown. Here we show that in response to treatment of mice with interferon-alpha (IFN alpha), HSCs efficiently exit G(0) and enter an active cell cycle. HSCs respond to IFN alpha treatment by the increased phosphorylation of STAT1 and PKB/Akt (also known as AKT1), the expression of IFN alpha target genes, and the upregulation of stem cell antigen-1 (Sca-1, also known as LY6A). HSCs lacking the IFN alpha/beta receptor (IFNAR)(2), STAT1 (ref. 3) or Sca-1 (ref. 4) are insensitive to IFN alpha stimulation, demonstrating that STAT1 and Sca-1 mediate IFN alpha-induced HSC proliferation. Although dormant HSCs are resistant to the anti-proliferative chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluoro-uracil(1,5), HSCs pre-treated (primed) with IFN alpha and thus induced to proliferate are efficiently eliminated by 5-fluoro-uracil exposure in vivo. Conversely, HSCs chronically activated by IFN alpha are functionally compromised and are rapidly out-competed by non-activatable Ifnar(-/-) cells in competitive repopulation assays. Whereas chronic activation of the IFN alpha pathway in HSCs impairs their function, acute IFN alpha treatment promotes the proliferation of dormant HSCs in vivo. These data may help to clarify the so far unexplained clinical effects of IFN alpha on leukaemic cells(6,7), and raise the possibility for new applications of type I interferons to target cancer stem cells(8).","Essers, Marieke A.

94,13,264.0,"Bacteria and Archaea have developed several defence strategies against foreign nucleic acids such as viral genomes and plasmids. Among them, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) loci together with cas (CRISPR-associated) genes form the CRISPR/Cas immune system, which involves partially palindromic repeats separated by short stretches of DNA called spacers, acquired from extrachromosomal elements. It was recently demonstrated that these variable loci can incorporate spacers from infecting bacteriophages and then provide immunity against subsequent bacteriophage infections in a sequence-specific manner. Here we show that the Streptococcus thermophilus CRISPR1/Cas system can also naturally acquire spacers from a self-replicating plasmid containing an antibiotic-resistance gene, leading to plasmid loss. Acquired spacers that match antibiotic-resistance genes provide a novel means to naturally select bacteria that cannot uptake and disseminate such genes. We also provide in vivo evidence that the CRISPR1/Cas system specifically cleaves plasmid and bacteriophage double-stranded DNA within the proto-spacer, at specific sites. Our data show that the CRISPR/Cas immune system is remarkably adapted to cleave invading DNA rapidly and has the potential for exploitation to generate safer microbial strains.","Garneau, Josiane E.; Dupuis, Marie-Eve; Villion, Manuela; Romero, Dennis A.; Barrangou, Rodolphe; Boyaval, Patrick; Fremaux, Christophe; Horvath, Philippe; Magadan, Alfonso H.; Moineau, Sylvain","Garneau, JE; Dupuis, ME; Villion, M; Romero, DA; Barrangou, R; Boyaval, P; Fremaux, C; Horvath, P; Magadan, AH; Moineau, S",67.0,"[Garneau, Josiane E.; Dupuis, Marie-Eve; Villion, Manuela; Magadan, Alfonso H.; Moineau, Sylvain] Univ Laval, Felix dHerelle Reference Ctr Bacterial Viruses, Dept Biochim Microbiol & Bioinformat, Fac Med Dent,Grp Rech Ecol Buccale,Fac Sci & Geni, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Romero, Dennis A.; Barrangou, Rodolphe] Danisco USA Inc, Madison, WI 53716 USA; [Boyaval, Patrick; Fremaux, Christophe; Horvath, Philippe] Danisco France SAS, F-86220 Dange St Romain, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09523,Article,,Sylvain.Moineau@bcm.ulaval.ca,+,Novalait/FQRNT; Clarin/FICYT; NSERC; CIHR,"We thank T.R.

Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are an abundant population of innate-like T cells in humans that are activated by an antigen(s) bound to the MHC class I-like molecule MR1. Although the identity of MR1-restricted antigen(s) is unknown, it is present in numerous bacteria and yeast. Here we show that the structure and chemistry within the antigen-binding cleft of MR1 is distinct from the MHC and CD1 families. MR1 is ideally suited to bind ligands originating from vitamin metabolites. The structure of MR1 in complex with 6-formyl pterin, a folic acid (vitamin B9) metabolite, shows the pterin ring sequestered within MR1. Furthermore, we characterize related MR1-restricted vitamin derivatives, originating from the bacterial riboflavin (vitamin B2) biosynthetic pathway, which specifically and potently activate MAIT cells. Accordingly, we show that metabolites of vitamin B represent a class of antigen that are presented by MR1 for MAIT-cell immunosurveillance. As many vitamin biosynthetic pathways are unique to bacteria and yeast, our data suggest that MAIT cells use these metabolites to detect microbial infection.","Kjer-Nielsen, Lars; Patel, Onisha; Corbett, Alexandra J.; Le Nours, Jerome; Meehan, Bronwyn; Liu, Ligong; Bhati, Mugdha; Chen, Zhenjun; Kostenko, Lyudmila; Reantragoon, Rangsima; Williamson, Nicholas A.; Purcell, Anthony W.; Dudek, Nadine L.; McConville, Malcolm J.; O'Hair, Richard A.

The simulations quantitatively explain the basic principles of decoding in all three codon positions and reveal the key elements responsible for specificity of the release factors. The overall reading mechanism involves hitherto unidentified interactions and recognition switches that cannot be described in terms of a tripeptide anticodon model. Further simulations of complexes with tRNA(Trp), the tRNA recognizing the triplet codon for Trp, explain the observation of a 'leaky' stop codon 5 and highlight the fundamentally different third position reading by RF2, which leads to a high stop-codon specificity with strong discrimination against the Trp codon. The simulations clearly illustrate the versatility of codon reading by protein, which goes far beyond tRNA mimicry.","Sund, Johan; Ander, Martin; Aqvist, Johan","Sund, J; Ander, M; Aqvist, J",947.0,"[Sund, Johan; Ander, Martin; Aqvist, Johan] Uppsala Univ, Biomed Ctr, Dept Cell & Mol Biol, SE-75124 Uppsala, Sweden",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09082,Article,,aqvist@xray.bmc.uu.se,U12,Swedish Research Council,"Support from the Swedish Research Council is gratefully acknowledged.

97,15,339.0,"X-ray tomography is an invaluable tool in biomedical imaging. It can deliver the three-dimensional internal structure of entire organisms as well as that of single cells, and even gives access to quantitative information, crucially important both for medical applications and for basic research(1-4). Most frequently such information is based on X-ray attenuation. Phase contrast is sometimes used for improved visibility but remains significantly harder to quantify(5,6). Here we describe an X-ray computed tomography technique that generates quantitative high-contrast three-dimensional electron density maps from phase contrast information without reverting to assumptions of a weak phase object or negligible absorption. This method uses a ptychographic coherent imaging approach to record tomographic data sets, exploiting both the high penetration power of hard X-rays and the high sensitivity of lensless imaging(7-9). As an example, we present images of a bone sample in which structures on the 100 nm length scale such as the osteocyte lacunae and the interconnective canalicular network are clearly resolved. The recovered electron density map provides a contrast high enough to estimate nanoscale bone density variations of less than one per cent. We expect this high-resolution tomography technique to provide invaluable information for both the life and materials sciences.","Dierolf, Martin; Menzel, Andreas; Thibault, Pierre; Schneider, Philipp; Kewish, Cameron M.; Wepf, Roger; Bunk, Oliver; Pfeiffer, Franz","Dierolf, M; Menzel, A; Thibault, P; Schneider, P; Kewish, CM; Wepf, R; Bunk, O; Pfeiffer, F",436.0,"[Dierolf, Martin; Thibault, Pierre; Pfeiffer, Franz] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Phys E17, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Menzel, Andreas; Kewish, Cameron M.; Bunk, Oliver] Paul Scherrer Inst, Swiss Light Source, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland; [Schneider, Philipp] ETH, Inst Biomech, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Wepf, Roger] EMEZ, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09419,Article,,pierre.thibault@tum.de,U82,"DFG Cluster of Excellence ""Munich-Centre for Advanced Photonics""","We acknowledge technical support by X.

98,145,136.0,"UvrD helicase is required for nucleotide excision repair, although its role in this process is not well defined. Here we show that Escherichia coli UvrD binds RNA polymerase during transcription elongation and, using its helicase/translocase activity, forces RNA polymerase to slide backward along DNA. By inducing backtracking, UvrD exposes DNA lesions shielded by blocked RNA polymerase, allowing nucleotide excision repair enzymes to gain access to sites of damage. Our results establish UvrD as a bona fide transcription elongation factor that contributes to genomic integrity by resolving conflicts between transcription and DNA repair complexes. Furthermore, we show that the elongation factor NusA cooperates with UvrD in coupling transcription to DNA repair by promoting backtracking and recruiting nucleotide excision repair enzymes to exposed lesions. Because backtracking is a shared feature of all cellular RNA polymerases, we propose that this mechanism enables RNA polymerases to function as global DNA damage scanners in bacteria and eukaryotes.","Epshtein, Vitaly; Kamarthapu, Venu; McGary, Katelyn; Svetlov, Vladimir; Ueberheide, Beatrix; Proshkin, Sergey; Mironov, Alexander; Nudler, Evgeny","Epshtein, V; Kamarthapu, V; McGary, K; Svetlov, V; Ueberheide, B; Proshkin, S; Mironov, A; Nudler, E",372.0,"[Epshtein, Vitaly; Kamarthapu, Venu; McGary, Katelyn; Svetlov, Vladimir; Ueberheide, Beatrix; Nudler, Evgeny] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Pharmacol, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Kamarthapu, Venu; Nudler, Evgeny] NYU, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Proshkin, Sergey; Mironov, Alexander] State Res Inst Genet & Select Ind Microorganisms, Moscow 117545, Russia; [Mironov, Alexander] Russian Acad Sci, Engelhardt Inst Mol Biol, Moscow 119991, Russia",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12928,Article,1476-4687,evgeny.nudler@nyumc.org,+,Russian Foundation for Basic Research; NIH; BGRF; Dynasty foundation; Howard Hughes Medical Institute,"We thank D.

99,73,479.0,"The thermal structure of the crust strongly influences deformation, metamorphism and plutonism(1-3). Models for the geothermal gradient in stable crust predict a steady increase of temperature with depth. This thermal structure, however, is incompatible with observations from high- temperature metamorphic terranes exhumed in orogens(1,4,5,6). Global compilations(7) of peak conditions in high- temperature metamorphic terranes define relatively narrow ranges of peak temperatures over a wide range in pressure, for both isothermal decompression and isobaric cooling paths. Here we develop simple one- dimensional thermal models that include the effects of melt migration. These models show that long- lived plutonism results in a quasi- steady- state geotherm with a rapid temperature increase in the upper crust and nearly isothermal conditions in the middle and lower crust. The models also predict that the upward advection of heat by melt generates granulite facies metamorphism, and widespread andalusite - sillimanite metamorphism in the upper crust. Once the quasi- steady- state thermal profile is reached, the middle and lower crust are greatly weakened due to high temperatures and anatectic conditions, thus setting the stage for gravitational collapse(8), exhumation and isothermal decompression after the onset of plutonism. Near- iso-thermal conditions in the middle and lower crust result from the thermal buffering effect of dehydration melting reactions that, in part, control the shape of the geotherm.","Depine, Gabriela V.; Andronicos, Christopher L.; Phipps-Morgan, Jason","Depine, GV; Andronicos, CL; Phipps-Morgan, J",80.0,"[Depine, Gabriela V.; Andronicos, Christopher L.; Phipps-Morgan, Jason] Cornell Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06689,Article,1476-4687,gvd2@cornell.edu,83,,,269SZ,,,THERMAL-PROCESSES; BRITISH-COLUMBIA; OROGENIC BELTS; GRANITE; FLOW; METAMORPHISM; EMPLACEMENT; MOUNTAINS; ANATEXIS; SOLIDUS,7183.0,NATURE,Nature,English,34.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",6-Mar,4.0,LONDON,18322532.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,,"Depine, GV (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Snee Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,34.0,Near-isothermal conditions in the middle and lower crust induced by melt migration,2.0,19.0,WOS:000253671900050,479.0,452,Multidisciplinary Sciences,34,jason,phipps-morgan,9583.0,4927,male,1.0,D2TRutgAAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",45641474,1,673711,1,Morgan (2016 film),Morgan (2016 film),0,0
100,14,268.0,"The meridional overturning circulation (MOC) of the Atlantic Ocean is considered to be one of the most important components of the climate system. This is because its warm surface currents, such as the Gulf Stream, redistribute huge amounts of energy from tropical to high latitudes and influence regional weather and climate patterns, whereas its lower limb ventilates the deep ocean and affects the storage of carbon in the abyss, away from the atmosphere. Despite its significance for future climate, the operation of the MOC under contrasting climates of the past remains controversial. Nutrient-based proxies(1,2) and recent model simulations(3) indicate that during the Last Glacial Maximum the convective activity in the North Atlantic Ocean was much weaker than at present. In contrast, rate-sensitive radiogenic Pa-231/Th-230 isotope ratios from the North Atlantic have been interpreted to indicate only minor changes in MOC strength(4-6). Here we show that the basin-scale abyssal circulation of the Atlantic Ocean was probably reversed during the Last Glacial Maximum and was dominated by northward water flow from the Southern Ocean. These conclusions are based on new high-resolution data from the South Atlantic Ocean that establish the basin-scale north to south gradient in Pa-231/Th-230, and thus the direction of the deep ocean circulation. Our findings are consistent with nutrient-based proxies and argue that further analysis of Pa-231/Th-230 outside the North Atlantic basin will enhance our understanding of past ocean circulation, provided that spatial gradients are carefully considered. This broader perspective suggests that the modern pattern of the Atlantic MOC-with a prominent southerly flow of deep waters originating in the North Atlantic-arose only during the Holocene epoch.","Negre, Cesar; Zahn, Rainer; Thomas, Alexander L.; Masque, Pere; Henderson, Gideon M.; Martinez-Mendez, Gema; Hall, Ian R.; Mas, Jose L.","Negre, C; Zahn, R; Thomas, AL; Masque, P; Henderson, GM; Martinez-Mendez, G; Hall, IR; Mas, JL",84.0,"[Negre, Cesar; Zahn, Rainer; Masque, Pere; Martinez-Mendez, Gema] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, ICTA, Bellaterra 08193, Spain; [Zahn, Rainer] Lluis Co 23, ICREA, Barcelona 08010, Spain; [Zahn, Rainer; Masque, Pere] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Fis, Bellaterra 08193, Spain; [Thomas, Alexander L.; Henderson, Gideon M.] Univ Oxford, Dept Earth Sci, Oxford OX1 3AN, England; [Hall, Ian R.] Cardiff Univ, Sch Earth & Ocean Sci, Cardiff CF10 3YE, S Glam, Wales; [Mas, Jose L.] Univ Seville, Escuela Univ Politecn, Dipartimento Fis Aplicada 1, E-41012 Seville, Spain",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09508,Article,1476-4687,cesar@negre.us,+,"Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion, Spain [AP-2004-4278, REN2002-01958]; Comer Abrupt Climate Change Foundation; Generalitat de Catalunya;  [CGL2007-61579/CLI]; ICREA","MD02-2594 and MD02-2588 sediment cores were provided by the International Marine Past Global Changes Study (IMAGES) and the Institute Polaire Francais Paul Emile Victor (IPEV).

Phylogenomic analysis of 1,070 orthologues from 23 yeast genomes identified 1,070 distinct gene trees, which were all incongruent with the phylogeny inferred from concatenation. Incongruence severity increased for shorter internodes located deeper in the phylogeny. Notably, whereas most practices had little or negative impact on the yeast phylogeny, the use of genes or internodes with high average internode support significantly improved the robustness of inference. We obtained similar results in analyses of vertebrate and metazoan phylogenomic data sets. These results question the exclusive reliance on concatenation and associated practices, and argue that selecting genes with strong phylogenetic signals and demonstrating the absence of significant incongruence are essential for accurately reconstructing ancient divergences.","Salichos, Leonidas; Rokas, Antonis","Salichos, L; Rokas, A",327.0,"[Salichos, Leonidas; Rokas, Antonis] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Nashville, TN 37235 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12130,Article,,antonis.rokas@vanderbilt.edu,+,National Science Foundation [DEB-0844968],We thank K.

102,160,451.0,"Artificial spin ice(1) is a class of lithographically created arrays of interacting ferromagnetic nanometre-scale islands. It was introduced to investigate many-body phenomena related to frustration and disorder in a material that could be tailored to precise specifications and imaged directly. Because of the large magnetic energy scales of these nanoscale islands, it has so far been impossible to thermally anneal artificial spin ice into desired thermodynamic ensembles; nearly all studies of artificial spin ice have either treated it as a granular material activated by alternating fields(2) or focused on the as-grown state of the arrays(3). This limitation has prevented experimental investigation of novel phases that can emerge from the nominal ground states of frustrated lattices. For example, artificial kagome spin ice, in which the islands are arranged on the edges of a hexagonal net, is predicted to support states with monopolar charge order at entropies below that of the previously observed pseudo-ice manifold(4). Here we demonstrate a method for thermalizing artificial spin ices with square and kagome lattices by heating above the Curie temperature of the constituent material. In this manner, artificial square spin ice achieves unprecedented thermal ordering of the moments. In artificial kagome spin ice, we observe incipient crystallization of the magnetic charges embedded in pseudo-ice, with crystallites of magnetic charges whose size can be controlled by tuning the lattice constant. We find excellent agreement between experimental data and Monte Carlo simulations of emergent charge-charge interactions.","Zhang, Sheng; Gilbert, Ian; Nisoli, Cristiano; Chern, Gia-Wei; Erickson, Michael J.; O'Brien, Liam; Leighton, Chris; Lammert, Paul E.; Crespi, Vincent H.; Schiffer, Peter","Zhang, S; Gilbert, I; Nisoli, C; Chern, GW; Erickson, MJ; O'Brien, L; Leighton, C; Lammert, PE; Crespi, VH; Schiffer, P",553.0,"[Zhang, Sheng; Lammert, Paul E.; Crespi, Vincent H.] Penn State Univ, Dept Phys, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Zhang, Sheng; Lammert, Paul E.; Crespi, Vincent H.] Penn State Univ, Mat Res Inst, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Gilbert, Ian; Schiffer, Peter] Univ Illinois, Dept Phys, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Gilbert, Ian; Schiffer, Peter] Univ Illinois, Frederick Seitz Mat Res Lab, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Nisoli, Cristiano; Chern, Gia-Wei] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Div Theoret, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA; [Erickson, Michael J.; O'Brien, Liam; Leighton, Chris] Univ Minnesota, Dept Chem Engn & Mat Sci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [O'Brien, Liam] Univ Cambridge, Cavendish Lab, Dept Phys, Thin Film Magnetism Grp, Cambridge CB3 0HE, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12399,Article,,pschiffe@illinois.edu,557,"US Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-SC0005313]; US Department of Energy at LANL [DE-AC52-06NA253962]; NSF MRSEC [DMR-0819885, DMR-0820404]; EU Marie Curie IOF [299376]","This project was funded by the US Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under grant no.

104,95,54.0,"It has been assumed that Himalayan earthquakes are driven by the release of compressional strain accumulating close to the Greater Himalaya. However, elastic models of the Indo - Asian collision using recently imaged subsurface interface geometries suggest that a substantial fraction of the southernmost 500 kilometres of the Tibetan plateau participates in driving great ruptures. We show here that this Tibetan reservoir of elastic strain energy is drained in proportion to Himalayan rupture length, and that the consequent growth of slip and magnitude with rupture area, when compared to data from recent earthquakes, can be used to infer a similar to 500-year renewal time for these events. The elastic models also illuminate two puzzling features of plate boundary seismicity: how great earthquakes can re-rupture regions that have already ruptured in recent smaller earthquakes and how mega-earthquakes with greater than 20 metres slip may occur at millennia-long intervals, driven by residual strain following many centuries of smaller earthquakes.","Feldl, Nicole; Bilham, Roger","Feldl, N; Bilham, R",165.0,"Univ Colorado, CIRES, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; Univ Colorado, Dept Geol Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature05199,Article,,bilham@colorado.edu,170,,,103DZ,,,GPS MEASUREMENTS; SEISMIC MOMENTS; SOUTHERN TIBET; NEPAL; INDIA; DEFORMATION; RUPTURE; TECTONICS; SLIP; CONVERGENCE,7116.0,NATURE,Nature,English,42.0,No,"Bilham, Roger/0000-0002-5547-4102","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",9-Nov,6.0,LONDON,17093444.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,,"Bilham, R (reprint author), Univ Colorado, CIRES, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,93.0,Great Himalayan earthquakes and the Tibetan plateau,1.0,30.0,WOS:000241867200032,54.0,444,Multidisciplinary Sciences,100,roger,bilham,13160.0,1220,male,1.0,ha3PY_0AAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0

Without rigorous standards we risk an acceleration of false-positive reports of causality, which would impede the translation of genomic research findings into the clinical diagnostic setting and hinder biological understanding of disease. Here we discuss the key challenges of assessing sequence variants in human disease, integrating both gene-level and variant-level support for causality. We propose guidelines for summarizing confidence in variant pathogenicity and highlight several areas that require further resource development.","MacArthur, D. G.; Manolio, T. A.; Dimmock, D.

107,78,177.0,"Bacteria with greatly elevated mutation rates ( mutators) are frequently found in natural(1-3) and laboratory(4,5) populations, and are often associated with clinical infections(6,7). Although mutators may increase adaptability to novel environmental conditions, they are also prone to the accumulation of deleterious mutations. The long-term maintenance of high bacterial mutation rates is therefore likely to be driven by rapidly changing selection pressures(8-14), in addition to the possible slow transition rate by point mutation from mutators to non- mutators(15). One of the most likely causes of rapidly changing selection pressures is antagonistic coevolution with parasites(16,17). Here we show whether coevolution with viral parasites could drive the evolution of bacterial mutation rates in laboratory populations of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens(18). After fewer than 200 bacterial generations, 25% of the populations coevolving with phages had evolved 10- to 100- fold increases in mutation rates owing to mutations in mismatch-repair genes; no populations evolving in the absence of phages showed any significant change in mutation rate. Furthermore, mutator populations had a higher probability of driving their phage populations extinct, strongly suggesting that mutators have an advantage against phages in the coevolutionary arms race. Given their ubiquity, bacteriophages may play an important role in the evolution of bacterial mutation rates.","Pal, Csaba; Macia, Maria D.; Oliver, Antonio; Schachar, Ira; Buckling, Angus","Pal, C; Macia, MD; Oliver, A; Schachar, I; Buckling, A",1079.0,"Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; Biol Res Ctr, Inst Biochem, H-6701 Szeged, Hungary; IUNICS, Hosp Son Dureta, Microbiol Serv, Palma de Mallorca 07014, Spain; IUNICS, Hosp Son Dureta, Unidad Invest, Palma de Mallorca 07014, Spain",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06350,Article,,cpal@ramet.elte.hu; angus.buckling@zoo.ox.ac.uk,1081,,,240HY,,,ESCHERICHIA-COLI; PSEUDOMONAS-AERUGINOSA; ASEXUAL POPULATIONS; ADAPTIVE EVOLUTION; LOCAL ADAPTATION; HIGH-FREQUENCY; GENES; INFECTION; PARASITES; MUTANTS,7172.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,"Oliver, Antonio/0000-0001-9327-1894","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",13-Dec,3.0,LONDON,18059461.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007.0,"Oliver, Antonio/E-4048-2012","Buckling, A (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PS, England.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,156.0,Coevolution with viruses drives the evolution of bacterial mutation rates,7.0,84.0,WOS:000251579900086,177.0,450,Multidisciplinary Sciences,158,angus,buckling,11721.0,103,male,0.96,LtWL6dAAAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",17734697,1,19348382,1,Angus Barnett,Angus Barnett,0,0
108,19,481.0,"The molecular clock maintains energy constancy by producing circadian oscillations of rate-limiting enzymes involved in tissue metabolism across the day and night(1-3). During periods of feeding, pancreatic islets secrete insulin to maintain glucose homeostasis, and although rhythmic control of insulin release is recognized to be dysregulated in humans with diabetes(4), it is not known how the circadian clock may affect this process. Here we show that pancreatic islets possess self-sustained circadian gene and protein oscillations of the transcription factors CLOCK and BMAL1. The phase of oscillation of islet genes involved in growth, glucose metabolism and insulin signalling is delayed in circadian mutant mice, and both Clock(5,6) and Bmal1(7) (also called Arntl) mutants show impaired glucose tolerance, reduced insulin secretion and defects in size and proliferation of pancreatic islets that worsen with age. Clock disruption leads to transcriptome-wide alterations in the expression of islet genes involved in growth, survival and synaptic vesicle assembly. Notably, conditional ablation of the pancreatic clock causes diabetes mellitus due to defective beta-cell function at the very latest stage of stimulus-secretion coupling. These results demonstrate a role for the beta-cell clock in coordinating insulin secretion with the sleep-wake cycle, and reveal that ablation of the pancreatic clock can trigger the onset of diabetes mellitus.","Marcheva, Biliana; Ramsey, Kathryn Moynihan; Buhr, Ethan D.; Kobayashi, Yumiko; Su, Hong; Ko, Caroline H.; Ivanova, Ganka; Omura, Chiaki; Mo, Shelley; Vitaterna, Martha H.; Lopez, James P.; Philipson, Louis H.; Bradfield, Christopher A.; Crosby, Seth D.; JeBailey, Lellean; Wang, Xiaozhong; Takahashi, Joseph S.; Bass, Joseph","Marcheva, B; Ramsey, KM; Buhr, ED; Kobayashi, Y; Su, H; Ko, CH; Ivanova, G; Omura, C; Mo, S; Vitaterna, MH; Lopez, JP; Philipson, LH; Bradfield, CA; Crosby, SD; JeBailey, L; Wang, XZ; Takahashi, JS; Bass, J",627.0,"[Marcheva, Biliana; Ramsey, Kathryn Moynihan; Kobayashi, Yumiko; Ivanova, Ganka; Omura, Chiaki; Bass, Joseph] Northwestern Univ, Dept Med, Feinberg Sch Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Marcheva, Biliana; Ramsey, Kathryn Moynihan; Buhr, Ethan D.; Kobayashi, Yumiko; Ko, Caroline H.; Ivanova, Ganka; Omura, Chiaki; Bass, Joseph] Northwestern Univ, Dept Neurobiol & Physiol, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Su, Hong; Wang, Xiaozhong] Northwestern Univ, Dept Biochem Mol Biol & Cell Biol, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Mo, Shelley] Northwestern Univ, Weinberg Coll Arts & Sci, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Vitaterna, Martha H.; Bass, Joseph] Northwestern Univ, Ctr Sleep & Circadian Biol, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Lopez, James P.; Philipson, Louis H.] Univ Chicago, Dept Med, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Bradfield, Christopher A.] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Med & Publ Hlth, McArdle Lab Canc Res, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Crosby, Seth D.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, St Louis, MO 63108 USA; [JeBailey, Lellean] GeneGo Inc, St Joseph, MI 49085 USA; [Takahashi, Joseph S.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Neurosci, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Takahashi, Joseph S.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dallas, TX 75390 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09253,Article,,j-bass@northwestern.edu,631,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases; National Institutes of Health [R37-ES-005703]; Chicago Biomedical Consortium; Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation; National Institute of Mental Health,"We thank F.

109,163,5.0,"Some evolutionary innovations may originate non-adaptively as exaptations, or pre-adaptations, which are by-products of other adaptive traits(1-5). Examples include feathers, which originated before they were used in flight(2), and lens crystallins, which are light-refracting proteins that originated as enzymes(6). The question of how often adaptive traits have non-adaptive origins has profound implications for evolutionary biology, but is difficult to address systematically. Here we consider this issue in metabolism, one of the most ancient biological systems that is central to all life. We analyse a metabolic trait of great adaptive importance: the ability of a metabolic reaction network to synthesize all biomass from a single source of carbon and energy. We use novel computational methods to sample randomly many metabolic networks that can sustain life on any given carbon source but contain an otherwise random set of known biochemical reactions. We show that when we require such networks to be viable on one particular carbon source, they are typically also viable on multiple other carbon sources that were not targets of selection. For example, viability on glucose may entail viability on up to 44 other sole carbon sources. Any one adaptation in these metabolic systems typically entails multiple potential exaptations. Metabolic systems thus contain a latent potential for evolutionary innovations with non-adaptive origins. Our observations suggest that many more metabolic traits may have non-adaptive origins than is appreciated at present. They also challenge our ability to distinguish adaptive from non-adaptive traits.","Barve, Aditya; Wagner, Andreas","Barve, A; Wagner, A",203.0,"[Barve, Aditya; Wagner, Andreas] Univ Zurich, Inst Evolutionary Biol & Environm Sci, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Barve, Aditya; Wagner, Andreas] Swiss Inst Bioinformat, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Wagner, Andreas] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12301,Article,1476-4687,andreas.wagner@ieu.uzh.ch,+,Swiss National Science Foundation [315230-129708],"We thank K.

110,125,130.0,"In BRAF(V600)-mutant tumours, most mechanisms of resistance to drugs that target the BRAF and/or MEK kinases rely on reactivation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction pathway, on activation of the alternative, PI(3) K-AKT-mTOR, pathway (which is ERK independent) or on modulation of the caspase-dependent apoptotic cascade(1-3). All three pathways converge to regulate the formation of the eIF4F eukaryotic translation initiation complex, which binds to the 7-methylguanylate cap (m(7)G) at the 59 end of messenger RNA, thereby modulating the translation of specific mRNAs(4,5). Here we show that the persistent formation of the eIF4F complex, comprising the eIF4E cap-binding protein, the eIF4G scaffolding protein and the eIF4A RNA helicase, is associated with resistance to anti-BRAF, anti-MEK and anti-BRAF plus anti-MEK drug combinations in BRAF(V600)-mutant melanoma, colon and thyroid cancer cell lines. Resistance to treatment and maintenance of eIF4F complex formation is associated with one of three mechanisms: reactivation of MAPK signalling, persistent ERK-independent phosphorylation of the inhibitory eIF4E-binding protein 4EBP1 or increased pro-apoptotic BCL-2-modifying factor (BMF)-dependent degradation of eIF4G. The development of an in situ method to detect the eIF4E-eIF4G interactions shows that eIF4F complex formation is decreased in tumours that respond to anti-BRAF therapy and increased in resistant metastases compared to tumours before treatment. Strikingly, inhibiting the eIF4F complex, either by blocking the eIF4E-eIF4G interaction or by targeting eIF4A, synergizes with inhibiting BRAF(V600) to kill the cancer cells. eIF4F not only appears to be an indicator of both innate and acquired resistance but also is a promising therapeutic target. Combinations of drugs targeting BRAF(and/or MEK) and eIF4F may overcome most of the resistance mechanisms arising in BRAF(V600)-mutant cancers.","Boussemart, Lise; Malka-Mahieu, Helene; Girault, Isabelle; Allard, Delphine; Hemmingsson, Oskar; Tomasic, Gorana; Thomas, Marina; Basmadjian, Christine; Ribeiro, Nigel; Thuaud, Frederic; Mateus, Christina; Routier, Emilie; Kamsu-Kom, Nyam; Agoussi, Sandrine; Eggermont, Alexander M.; Desaubry, Laurent; Robert, Caroline; Vagner, Stephan","Boussemart, L; Malka-Mahieu, H; Girault, I; Allard, D; Hemmingsson, O; Tomasic, G; Thomas, M; Basmadjian, C; Ribeiro, N; Thuaud, F; Mateus, C; Routier, E; Kamsu-Kom, N; Agoussi, S; Eggermont, AM; Desaubry, L; Robert, C; Vagner, S",105.0,"[Boussemart, Lise; Malka-Mahieu, Helene; Girault, Isabelle; Allard, Delphine; Hemmingsson, Oskar; Kamsu-Kom, Nyam; Agoussi, Sandrine; Robert, Caroline; Vagner, Stephan] Inserm UMR981, F-94805 Villejuif, France; [Boussemart, Lise; Malka-Mahieu, Helene; Eggermont, Alexander M.; Robert, Caroline; Vagner, Stephan] Univ Paris 11, F-94276 Le Kremlin Bicetre, France; [Boussemart, Lise; Thomas, Marina; Mateus, Christina; Routier, Emilie; Eggermont, Alexander M.; Robert, Caroline; Vagner, Stephan] Gustave Roussy, Dermatooncol, F-94805 Villejuif, France; [Tomasic, Gorana] Gustave Roussy, Dept Pathol, F-94805 Villejuif, France; [Basmadjian, Christine; Ribeiro, Nigel; Thuaud, Frederic; Desaubry, Laurent] Strasbourg Univ, CNRS, UMR7200, F-67400 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13572,Article,1476-4687,caroline.robert@gustaveroussy.fr; stephan.vagner@inserm.fr,+,Institut National du CAncer (INCA); Association pour la Recherche sur le Cancer (ARC); Ligue contre le Cancer via an Integrated Research Action Program Melanoma (PAIR Melanome); Canceropole Ile de France and Ensemble Contre le Melanome; ARC; AAREC Filia Research for fellowships; Wenner-Gren Foundation; Swedish Society of Medicine,"The authors thank J.

111,206,342.0,"Freshening in the Canada basin of the Arctic Ocean began in the 1990s(1,2) and continued(3) to at least the end of 2008. By then, the Arctic Ocean might have gained four times as much fresh water as comprised the Great Salinity Anomaly(4,5) of the 1970s, raising the spectre of slowing global ocean circulation(6). Freshening has been attributed to increased sea ice melting(1) and contributions from runoff(7), but a leading explanation has been a strengthening of the Beaufort High-a characteristic peak in sea level atmospheric pressure(2,8)-which tends to accelerate an anticyclonic (clockwise) wind pattern causing convergence of fresh surface water. Limited observations have made this explanation difficult to verify, and observations of increasing freshwater content under a weakened Beaufort High suggest that other factors(2) must be affecting freshwater content. Here we use observations to show that during a time of record reductions in ice extent from 2005 to 2008, the dominant freshwater content changes were an increase in the Canada basin balanced by a decrease in the Eurasian basin. Observations are drawn from satellite data (sea surface height and ocean-bottom pressure) and in situ data. The freshwater changes were due to a cyclonic (anticlockwise) shift in the ocean pathway of Eurasian runoff forced by strengthening of the west-to-east Northern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation characterized by an increased Arctic Oscillation(9) index. Our results confirm that runoff is an important influence on the Arctic Ocean and establish that the spatial and temporal manifestations of the runoff pathways are modulated by the Arctic Oscillation, rather than the strength of the wind-driven Beaufort Gyre circulation.","Morison, James; Kwok, Ron; Peralta-Ferriz, Cecilia; Alkire, Matt; Rigor, Ignatius; Andersen, Roger; Steele, Mike","Morison, J; Kwok, R; Peralta-Ferriz, C; Alkire, M; Rigor, I; Andersen, R; Steele, M",66.0,"[Morison, James; Peralta-Ferriz, Cecilia; Alkire, Matt; Rigor, Ignatius; Andersen, Roger; Steele, Mike] Univ Washington, Appl Phys Lab, Polar Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA 98105 USA; [Kwok, Ron] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10705,Article,1476-4687,morison@apl.washington.edu,70,"NSF [OPP 0352754]; NASA [NNX08AH62G]; Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology; NASA MEASURES;  [ARC-0634226];  [ARC-0856330]","This work was supported chiefly by NSF grants OPP 0352754, ARC-0634226, ARC-0856330 and NASA grant NNX08AH62G.

112,105,262.0,"Since the 1950s, Heisenberg and others have addressed the problem of how to explain the appearance of countable particles in continuous fields(1). Stable localized field configurations were searched for an ingredient for a general field theory of elementary particles, but the majority of nonlinear field models were unable to predict them. As an exception, Skyrme succeeded in describing nuclear particles as localized states, so-called 'skyrmions'(2). Skyrmions are a characteristic of nonlinear continuum models ranging from microscopic to cosmological scales(3-6). Skyrmionic states have been found under non-equilibrium conditions, or when stabilized by external fields or the proliferation of topological defects. Examples are Turing patterns in classical liquids(7), spin textures in quantum Hall magnets(8), or the blue phases in liquid crystals(9). However, it has generally been assumed that skyrmions cannot form spontaneous ground states, such as ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic order, in magnetic materials. Here, we show theoretically that this assumption is wrong and that skyrmion textures may form spontaneously in condensed-matter systems with chiral interactions without the assistance of external fields or the proliferation of defects. We show this within a phenomenological continuum model based on a few material-specific parameters that can be determined experimentally. Our model has a condition not considered before: we allow for softened amplitude variations of the magnetization, characteristic of, for instance, metallic magnets. Our model implies that spontaneous skyrmion lattice ground states may exist generally in a large number of materials, notably at surfaces and in thin films, as well as in bulk compounds, where a lack of space inversion symmetry leads to chiral interactions.","Roessler, U.

113,182,9.0,"The activity of the cerebral cortex is thought to depend on the precise relationship between synaptic excitation and inhibition(1-4). In the visual cortex, in particular, intracellular measurements have related response selectivity to coordinated increases in excitation and inhibition(5-9). These measurements, however, have all been made during anaesthesia, which strongly influences cortical state(10) and therefore sensory processing(7,11-15). The synaptic activity that is evoked by visual stimulation during wakefulness is unknown. Here we measured visually evoked responses-and the underlying synaptic conductances-in the visual cortex of anaesthetized and awake mice. Under anaesthesia, responses could be elicited from a large region of visual space(16) and were prolonged. During wakefulness, responses were more spatially selective and much briefer. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of synaptic conductances(5,17) showed a difference in synaptic inhibition between the two conditions. Under anaesthesia, inhibition tracked excitation in amplitude and spatial selectivity. By contrast, during wakefulness, inhibition was much stronger than excitation and had extremely broad spatial selectivity. We conclude that during wakefulness, cortical responses to visual stimulation are dominated by synaptic inhibition, restricting the spatial spread and temporal persistence of neural activity. These results provide a direct glimpse of synaptic mechanisms that control sensory responses in the awake cortex.","Haider, Bilal; Haeusser, Michael; Carandini, Matteo","Haider, B; Hausser, M; Carandini, M",97.0,"[Haider, Bilal; Carandini, Matteo] UCL, UCL Inst Ophthalmol, London EC1V 9EL, England; [Haeusser, Michael] UCL, Wolfson Inst Biomed Res, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Haeusser, Michael] UCL, Dept Neurosci Physiol & Pharmacol, London WC1E 6BT, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11665,Article,,b.haider@ucl.ac.uk,+,National Science Foundation; European Research Council; Wellcome Trust; Medical Research Council; Gatsby Charitable Foundation,"We thank T.

114,29,297.0,"Fusarium species are among the most important phytopathogenic and toxigenic fungi. To understand the molecular underpinnings of pathogenicity in the genus Fusarium, we compared the genomes of three phenotypically diverse species: Fusarium graminearum, Fusarium verticillioides and Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici. Our analysis revealed lineage-specific (LS) genomic regions in F. oxysporum that include four entire chromosomes and account for more than one-quarter of the genome. LS regions are rich in transposons and genes with distinct evolutionary profiles but related to pathogenicity, indicative of horizontal acquisition. Experimentally, we demonstrate the transfer of two LS chromosomes between strains of F. oxysporum, converting a non-pathogenic strain into a pathogen. Transfer of LS chromosomes between otherwise genetically isolated strains explains the polyphyletic origin of host specificity and the emergence of new pathogenic lineages in F. oxysporum. These findings put the evolution of fungal pathogenicity into a new perspective.","Ma, Li-Jun; van der Does, H.

115,5,93.0,"Fluctuations in surface melting are known to affect the speed of glaciers and ice sheets(1-7), but their impact on the Greenland ice sheet in a warming climate remains uncertain(8). Although some studies suggest that greater melting produces greater ice-sheet acceleration(7,9), others have identified a long-term decrease in Greenland's flow despite increased melting(3). Here we use satellite observations of ice motion recorded in a land-terminating sector of southwest Greenland to investigate the manner in which ice flow develops during years of markedly different melting. Although peak rates of ice speed-up are positively correlated with the degree of melting, mean summer flow rates are not, because glacier slowdown occurs, on average, when a critical run-off threshold of about 1.4 centimetres a day is exceeded. In contrast to the first half of summer, when flow is similar in all years, speed-up during the latter half is 62 +/- 16 per cent less in warmer years. Consequently, in warmer years, the period of fast ice flow is three times shorter and, overall, summer ice flow is slower. This behaviour is at odds with that expected from basal lubrication alone(7,9). Instead, it mirrors that of mountain glaciers(10-12), where melt-induced acceleration of flow ceases during years of high melting once subglacial drainage becomes efficient. A model of ice-sheet flow that captures switching between cavity and channel drainage modes(13) is consistent with the run-off threshold, fast-flow periods, and later-summer speeds we have observed. Simulations of the Greenland ice-sheet flow under climate warming scenarios should account for the dynamic evolution of subglacial drainage; a simple model of basal lubrication alone misses key aspects of the ice sheet's response to climate warming.","Sundal, Aud Venke; Shepherd, Andrew; Nienow, Peter; Hanna, Edward; Palmer, Steven; Huybrechts, Philippe","Sundal, AV; Shepherd, A; Nienow, P; Hanna, E; Palmer, S; Huybrechts, P",522.0,"[Sundal, Aud Venke; Shepherd, Andrew; Palmer, Steven] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Nienow, Peter] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH8 9XP, Midlothian, Scotland; [Hanna, Edward] Univ Sheffield, Dept Geog, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Huybrechts, Philippe] Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Geog, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09740,Article,,a.shepherd@leeds.ac.uk,U83,UK NERC National Centre for Earth Observation; EU [026],"This work was supported by the UK NERC National Centre for Earth Observation, a Philip Leverhulme Prize to A.S. and by the EU FP7 Ice2Sea project (publ. no. 026).

116,162,482.0,"The cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent catabolite repression effect in Escherichia coli is among the most intensely studied regulatory processes in biology. However, the physiological function(s) of cAMP signalling and its molecular triggers remain elusive. Here we use a quantitative physiological approach to show that cAMP signalling tightly coordinates the expression of catabolic proteins with biosynthetic and ribosomal proteins, in accordance with the cellular metabolic needs during exponential growth. The expression of carbon catabolic genes increased linearly with decreasing growth rates upon limitation of carbon influx, but decreased linearly with decreasing growth rate upon limitation of nitrogen or sulphur influx. In contrast, the expression of biosynthetic genes showed the opposite linear growth-rate dependence as the catabolic genes. A coarse-grained mathematical model provides a quantitative framework for understanding and predicting gene expression responses to catabolic and anabolic limitations. A scheme of integral feedback control featuring the inhibition of cAMP signalling by metabolic precursors is proposed and validated. These results reveal a key physiological role of cAMP-dependent catabolite repression: to ensure that proteomic resources are spent on distinct metabolic sectors as needed in different nutrient environments. Our findings underscore the power of quantitative physiology in unravelling the underlying functions of complex molecular signalling networks.","You, Conghui; Okano, Hiroyuki; Hui, Sheng; Zhang, Zhongge; Kim, Minsu; Gunderson, Carl W.; Wang, Yi-Ping; Lenz, Peter; Yan, Dalai; Hwa, Terence","You, CH; Okano, H; Hui, S; Zhang, ZG; Kim, M; Gunderson, CW; Wang, YP; Lenz, P; Yan, DL; Hwa, T",301.0,"[You, Conghui; Okano, Hiroyuki; Hui, Sheng; Kim, Minsu; Hwa, Terence] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Phys, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [You, Conghui; Okano, Hiroyuki; Zhang, Zhongge; Gunderson, Carl W.; Hwa, Terence] Univ Calif San Diego, Div Biol Sci, Sect Mol Biol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Hui, Sheng; Hwa, Terence] Univ Calif San Diego, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Wang, Yi-Ping] Peking Univ, Coll Life Sci, State Key Lab Prot & Plant Gene Res, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Lenz, Peter] Univ Marburg, Dept Phys, D-35032 Marburg, Germany; [Lenz, Peter] Univ Marburg, Ctr Synthet Microbiol, D-35032 Marburg, Germany; [Yan, Dalai] Indiana Univ Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12446,Article,,hwa@ucsd.edu,306,Human Frontiers in Science Program [RGP0022]; NSF [PHY1058793]; NSF through the Center for Theoretical Biological Physics [PHY0822283],"We are grateful to R.

117,46,141.0,"Understanding cell motility will require detailed knowledge not only of the localization of signalling networks regulating actin polymerization, but also of their dynamics. Unfortunately, many signalling networks are not amenable to such analysis, as they are frequently transient and dispersed. By contrast, the signalling pathways used by pathogens undergoing actin-based motility are highly localized and operate in a constitutive fashion(1-5). Taking advantage of this, we have analysed the dynamics of neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP), WASP-interacting protein (WIP), GRB2 and NCK, which are required to stimulate actin-related protein (ARP) 2/3-complex-dependent actin-based motility of vaccinia virus(6-9), using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. Here we show that all four proteins are rapidly exchanging, albeit at different rates, and that the turnover of N-WASP depends on its ability to stimulate ARP2/3-complex-mediated actin polymerization. Conversely, disruption of the interaction of N-WASP with GRB2 and/or the barbed ends of actin filaments increases its exchange rate and results in a faster rate of virus movement. We suggest that the exchange rate of N-WASP controls the rate of ARP2/3-complex-dependent actin-based motility by regulating the extent of actin polymerization by antagonizing filament capping.","Weisswange, Ina; Newsome, Timothy P.; Schleich, Sibylle; Way, Michael","Weisswange, I; Newsome, TP; Schleich, S; Way, M",87.0,"[Weisswange, Ina; Newsome, Timothy P.; Schleich, Sibylle; Way, Michael] London Res Inst, Canc Res UK, Cell Motil Lab, London WC2A 3PX, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07773,Article,,michael.way@cancer.org.uk,U6,Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP); Cancer Research UK,"We would like to thank T.

118,212,462.0,"In many organisms, developmentally programmed double-strand breaks (DSBs) formed by the SPO11 transesterase initiate meiotic recombination, which promotes pairing and segregation of homologous chromosomes(1). Because every chromosome must receive a minimum number of DSBs, attention has focused on factors that support DSB formation(2). However, improperly repaired DSBs can cause meiotic arrest or mutation(3,4); thus, having too many DSBs is probably as deleterious as having too few. Only a small fraction of SPO11 protein ever makes a DSB in yeast or mouse(5) and SPO11 and its accessory factors remain abundant long after most DSB formation ceases(1), implying the existence of mechanisms that restrain SPO11 activity to limit DSB numbers. Here we report that the number of meiotic DSBs in mouse is controlled by ATM, a kinase activated by DNA damage to trigger checkpoint signalling and promote DSB repair. Levels of SPO11-oligonucleotide complexes, by-products of meiotic DSB formation, are elevated at least tenfold in spermatocytes lacking ATM. Moreover, Atm mutation renders SPO11-oligonucleotide levels sensitive to genetic manipulations that modulate SPO11 protein levels. We propose that ATM restrains SPO11 via a negative feedback loop in which kinase activation by DSBs suppresses further DSB formation. Our findings explain previously puzzling phenotypes of Atm-null mice and provide a molecular basis for the gonadal dysgenesis observed in ataxia telangiectasia, the human syndrome caused by ATM deficiency.","Lange, Julian; Pan, Jing; Cole, Francesca; Thelen, Michael P.; Jasin, Maria; Keeney, Scott","Lange, J; Pan, J; Cole, F; Thelen, MP; Jasin, M; Keeney, S",237.0,"[Lange, Julian; Pan, Jing; Keeney, Scott] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Program Mol Biol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Cole, Francesca; Jasin, Maria] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dev Biol Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Thelen, Michael P.] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Phys & Life Sci Directorate, Livermore, CA 94550 USA; [Keeney, Scott] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10065 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10508,Article,,m-jasin@ski.mskcc.org; s-keeney@ski.mskcc.org,U117,"NIH [HD040916, HD053855, GM058673]; Leukemia and Lymphoma Society; Ruth L.

119,157,374.0,"Sexual selection, through intra-male competition or female choice, is assumed to be a source of strong and sustained directional selection in the wild(1,2). In the presence of such strong directional selection, alleles enhancing a particular trait are predicted to become fixed within a population, leading to a decrease in the underlying genetic variation(3). However, there is often considerable genetic variation underlying sexually selected traits in wild populations, and consequently, this phenomenon has become a long-discussed issue in the field of evolutionary biology(1,4,5). In wild Soay sheep, large horns confer an advantage in strong intra-sexual competition, yet males show an inherited polymorphism for horn type and have substantial genetic variation in their horn size(6). Here we show that most genetic variation in this trait is maintained by a trade-off between natural and sexual selection at a single gene, relaxin-like receptor 2 (RXFP2). We found that an allele conferring larger horns, Ho+, is associated with higher reproductive success, whereas a smaller horn allele, Ho-P, confers increased survival, resulting in a net effect of overdominance (that is, heterozygote advantage) for fitness at RXFP2. The nature of this trade-off is simple relative to commonly proposed explanations for the maintenance of sexually selected traits, such as genic capture(7,8) ('good genes') and sexually antagonistic selection(5,9). Our results demonstrate that by identifying the genetic architecture of trait variation, we can determine the principal mechanisms maintaining genetic variation in traits under strong selection and explain apparently counter-evolutionary observations.","Johnston, Susan E.; Gratten, Jacob; Berenos, Camillo; Pilkington, Jill G.; Clutton-Brock, Tim H.; Pemberton, Josephine M.; Slate, Jon","Johnston, SE; Gratten, J; Berenos, C; Pilkington, JG; Clutton-Brock, TH; Pemberton, JM; Slate, J",93.0,"[Johnston, Susan E.; Gratten, Jacob; Slate, Jon] Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Johnston, Susan E.; Berenos, Camillo; Pilkington, Jill G.; Pemberton, Josephine M.] Univ Edinburgh, Inst Evolutionary Biol, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland; [Gratten, Jacob] Univ Queensland, Queensland Brain Inst, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Clutton-Brock, Tim H.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12489,Article,,Susan.Johnston@ed.ac.uk; j.slate@shef.ac.uk,+,Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC; European Research Council (ERC); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council CASE studentship,"We thank the numerous Soay sheep project members and volunteers for collection of data and samples; M.

120,92,480.0,"Extremely intense and ultrafast X-ray pulses from free-electron lasers offer unique opportunities to study fundamental aspects of complex transient phenomena in materials. Ultrafast time-resolved methods usually require highly synchronized pulses to initiate a transition and then probe it after a precisely defined time delay. In the X-ray regime, these methods are challenging because they require complex optical systems and diagnostics. Here we propose and apply a simple holographic measurement scheme, inspired by Newton's 'dusty mirror' experiment(1), to monitor the X-ray-induced explosion of microscopic objects. The sample is placed near an X-ray mirror; after the pulse traverses the sample, triggering the reaction, it is reflected back onto the sample by the mirror to probe this reaction. The delay is encoded in the resulting diffraction pattern to an accuracy of one femtosecond, and the structural change is holographically recorded with high resolution. We apply the technique to monitor the dynamics of polystyrene spheres in intense free-electron-laser pulses, and observe an explosion occurring well after the initial pulse. Our results support the notion that X-ray flash imaging(2,3) can be used to achieve high resolution, beyond radiation damage limits for biological samples(4). With upcoming ultrafast X-ray sources we will be able to explore the three-dimensional dynamics of materials at the time-scale of atomic motion.","Chapman, Henry N.; Hau-Riege, Stefan P.; Bogan, Michael J.; Bajt, Sasa; Barty, Anton; Boutet, Sebastien; Marchesini, Stefano; Frank, Matthias; Woods, Bruce W.; Benner, W.

Here we present three 1,000-year-old mycobacterial genomes from Peruvian human skeletons, revealing that a member of the M. tuberculosis complex caused human disease before contact. The ancient strains are distinct from known human-adapted forms and are most closely related to those adapted to seals and sea lions. Two independent dating approaches suggest a most recent common ancestor for the M. tuberculosis complex less than 6,000 years ago, which supports a Holocene dispersal of the disease. Our results implicate sea mammals as having played a role in transmitting the disease to humans across the ocean.","Bos, Kirsten I.; Harkins, Kelly M.; Herbig, Alexander; Coscolla, Mireia; Weber, Nico; Comas, Inaki; Forrest, Stephen A.; Bryant, Josephine M.; Harris, Simon R.; Schuenemann, Verena J.; Campbell, Tessa J.; Majander, Kerttu; Wilbur, Alicia K.; Guichon, Ricardo A.; Steadman, Dawnie L.

122,0,26.0,"The control of quantum systems is of fundamental scientific interest and promises powerful applications and technologies. Impressive progress has been achieved in isolating quantum systems from the environment and coherently controlling their dynamics, as demonstrated by the creation and manipulation of entanglement in various physical systems. However, for open quantum systems, engineering the dynamics of many particles by a controlled coupling to an environment remains largely unexplored. Here we realize an experimental toolbox for simulating an open quantum system with up to five quantum bits (qubits). Using a quantum computing architecture with trapped ions, we combine multi-qubit gates with optical pumping to implement coherent operations and dissipative processes. We illustrate our ability to engineer the open-system dynamics through the dissipative preparation of entangled states, the simulation of coherent many-body spin interactions, and the quantum non-demolition measurement of multi-qubit observables. By adding controlled dissipation to coherent operations, this work offers novel prospects for open-system quantum simulation and computation.","Barreiro, Julio T.; Mueller, Markus; Schindler, Philipp; Nigg, Daniel; Monz, Thomas; Chwalla, Michael; Hennrich, Markus; Roos, Christian F.; Zoller, Peter; Blatt, Rainer","Barreiro, JT; Muller, M; Schindler, P; Nigg, D; Monz, T; Chwalla, M; Hennrich, M; Roos, CF; Zoller, P; Blatt, R",486.0,"[Mueller, Markus; Chwalla, Michael; Roos, Christian F.; Zoller, Peter; Blatt, Rainer] Austrian Acad Sci, Inst Quantenopt & Quanteninformat, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Barreiro, Julio T.; Schindler, Philipp; Nigg, Daniel; Monz, Thomas; Chwalla, Michael; Hennrich, Markus; Roos, Christian F.; Blatt, Rainer] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Expt Phys, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Mueller, Markus; Zoller, Peter] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Theoret Phys, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09801,Article,,Peter.Zoller@uibk.ac.at; Rainer.Blatt@uibk.ac.at,491,Austrian Science Fund; European Commission; Institut fur Quanteninformation GmbH; European Community,"We thank K.

123,345,128.0,"Unlike random heteropolymers, natural proteins fold into unique ordered structures. Understanding how these are encoded in amino-acid sequences is complicated by energetically unfavourable non-ideal features-for example kinked alpha-helices, bulged beta-strands, strained loops and buried polar groups-that arise in proteins from evolutionary selection for biological function or from neutral drift. Here we describe an approach to designing ideal protein structures stabilized by completely consistent local and non-local interactions. The approach is based on a set of rules relating secondary structure patterns to protein tertiary motifs, which make possible the design of funnel-shaped protein folding energy landscapes leading into the target folded state. Guided by these rules, we designed sequences predicted to fold into ideal protein structures consisting of alpha-helices, beta-strands and minimal loops. Designs for five different topologies were found to be monomeric and very stable and to adopt structures in solution nearly identical to the computational models. These results illuminate how the folding funnels of natural proteins arise and provide the foundation for engineering a new generation of functional proteins free from natural evolution.","Koga, Nobuyasu; Tatsumi-Koga, Rie; Liu, Gaohua; Xiao, Rong; Acton, Thomas B.; Montelione, Gaetano T.; Baker, David","Koga, N; Tatsumi-Koga, R; Liu, GH; Xiao, R; Acton, TB; Montelione, GT; Baker, D",222.0,"[Koga, Nobuyasu; Tatsumi-Koga, Rie; Baker, David] Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Koga, Nobuyasu; Tatsumi-Koga, Rie; Baker, David] Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Liu, Gaohua; Xiao, Rong; Acton, Thomas B.; Montelione, Gaetano T.] Rutgers State Univ, Ctr Adv Biotechnol & Med, Dept Mol Biol & Biochem, NE Struct Genom Consortium, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; [Liu, Gaohua; Xiao, Rong; Acton, Thomas B.; Montelione, Gaetano T.] Univ Med & Dent New Jersey, Robert Wood Johnson Med Sch, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11600,Article,1476-4687,guy@cabm.rutgers.edu; dabaker@u.washington.edu,227,HHMI; DOE; DARPA; DTRA; National Institutes of General Medical Science Protein Structure Initiative (PSI: Biology) programme [U54 GM094597]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Postdoctoral Fellowships for Research Abroad,"We thank N.

124,99,224.0,"Homomeric ring ATPases perform many vital and varied tasks in the cell, ranging from chromosome segregation to protein degradation. Here we report the direct observation of the intersubunit coordination and step size of such a ring ATPase, the double- stranded- DNA packaging motor in the bacteriophage phi 29. Using high- resolution optical tweezers, we find that packaging occurs in increments of 10 base pairs ( bp). Statistical analysis of the preceding dwell times reveals that multiple ATPs bind during each dwell, and application of high force reveals that these 10- bp increments are composed of four 2.5- bp steps. These results indicate that the hydrolysis cycles of the individual subunits are highly coordinated by means of a mechanism novel for ring ATPases. Furthermore, a step size that is a non- integer number of base pairs demands new models for motor - DNA interactions.","Moffitt, Jeffrey R.; Chemla, Yann R.; Aathavan, K.; Grimes, Shelley; Jardine, Paul J.; Anderson, Dwight L.; Bustamante, Carlos","Moffitt, JR; Chemla, YR; Aathavan, K; Grimes, S; Jardine, PJ; Anderson, DL; Bustamante, C",446.0,"[Moffitt, Jeffrey R.; Chemla, Yann R.; Bustamante, Carlos] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Moffitt, Jeffrey R.; Chemla, Yann R.; Bustamante, Carlos] Univ Calif Berkeley, Jason L Choy Lab Single Mol Biophys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Aathavan, K.; Bustamante, Carlos] Univ Calif Berkeley, Biophys Grad Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Grimes, Shelley; Jardine, Paul J.; Anderson, Dwight L.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Diagnost & Biol Sci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Anderson, Dwight L.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Microbiol, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Bustamante, Carlos] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Bustamante, Carlos] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Bustamante, Carlos] Univ Calif Berkeley, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07637,Article,1476-4687,carlos@alice.berkeley.edu,U2,"National Science Foundation's Graduate Research Fellowship; Burroughs Welcome Fund's Career Awards at the Scientific Interface; NIH [GM-071552, DE-003606, GM-059604]","We thank C.

125,8,155.0,"Impulsivity, describing action without foresight, is an important feature of several psychiatric diseases, suicidality and violent behaviour. The complex origins of impulsivity hinder identification of the genes influencing it and the diseases with which it is associated. Here we perform exon-focused sequencing of impulsive individuals in a founder population, targeting fourteen genes belonging to the serotonin and dopamine domain. A stop codon in HTR2B was identified that is common (minor allele frequency >1%) but exclusive to Finnish people. Expression of the gene in the human brain was assessed, as well as the molecular functionality of the stop codon, which was associated with psychiatric diseases marked by impulsivity in both population and family-based analyses. Knockout of Htr2b increased impulsive behaviours in mice, indicative of predictive validity. Our study shows the potential for identifying and tracing effects of rare alleles in complex behavioural phenotypes using founder populations, and indicates a role for HTR2B in impulsivity.","Bevilacqua, Laura; Doly, Stephane; Kaprio, Jaakko; Yuan, Qiaoping; Tikkanen, Roope; Paunio, Tiina; Zhou, Zhifeng; Wedenoja, Juho; Maroteaux, Luc; Diaz, Silvina; Belmer, Arnaud; Hodgkinson, Colin A.; Dell'Osso, Liliana; Suvisaari, Jaana; Coccaro, Emil; Rose, Richard J.; Peltonen, Leena; Virkkunen, Matti; Goldman, David","Bevilacqua, L; Doly, S; Kaprio, J; Yuan, QP; Tikkanen, R; Paunio, T; Zhou, ZF; Wedenoja, J; Maroteaux, L; Diaz, S; Belmer, A; Hodgkinson, CA; Dell'Osso, L; Suvisaari, J; Coccaro, E; Rose, RJ; Peltonen, L; Virkkunen, M; Goldman, D",1061.0,"[Bevilacqua, Laura; Yuan, Qiaoping; Zhou, Zhifeng; Hodgkinson, Colin A.; Goldman, David] NIAAA, Neurogenet Lab, NIH, Rockville, MD 20852 USA; [Doly, Stephane; Maroteaux, Luc; Diaz, Silvina; Belmer, Arnaud] INSERM, UMR S 839, F-75654 Paris, France; [Doly, Stephane; Maroteaux, Luc; Diaz, Silvina; Belmer, Arnaud] Univ Paris 06, Inst du Fer Moulin, F-75654 Paris, France; [Kaprio, Jaakko] Univ Helsinki, Dept Publ Hlth, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Kaprio, Jaakko] Inst Mol Med, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Kaprio, Jaakko] Natl Inst Hlth & Welf, Unit Child & Adolescent Psychiat, FI-00271 Helsinki, Finland; [Tikkanen, Roope; Virkkunen, Matti] Univ Helsinki, Inst Clin Med, Dept Psychiat, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Paunio, Tiina; Suvisaari, Jaana] Univ Helsinki, Dept Psychiat, Cent Hosp, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Wedenoja, Juho] Univ Helsinki, Dept Med Genet, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Wedenoja, Juho] Univ Helsinki, Inst Mol Med Finland, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Wedenoja, Juho] Natl Inst Hlth & Welf, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Dell'Osso, Liliana] Univ Pisa, Dept Psychiat, I-56100 Pisa, Italy; [Coccaro, Emil] Univ Chicago, Pritzker Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Rose, Richard J.] Indiana Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Virkkunen, Matti] Kellokoski Psychiat Hosp, FI-04500 Kellokoski, Finland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09629,Article,,davidgoldman@mail.nih.gov,U460,"National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, NIH; Academy of Finland Centre of Excellence in Complex Disease Genetics; National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism [AA-12502, AA-09203]; Academy of Finland [100499, 205585, 118555]; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale; Universite Pierre et Marie Curie; Fondation de France; Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale; French Ministry of Research (Agence Nationale pour la Recherche); European Union; IBRO; Region Ile de France DIM STEM","This study is dedicated to the memory of L.P. and M.

126,369,449.0,"A main limitation of therapies that selectively target kinase signalling pathways is the emergence of secondary drug resistance. Cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody that binds the extracellular domain of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), is effective in a subset of KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancers(1). After an initial response, secondary resistance invariably ensues, thereby limiting the clinical benefit of this drug(2). The molecular bases of secondary resistance to cetuximab in colorectal cancer are poorly understood(3-8). Here we show that molecular alterations (in most instances point mutations) of KRAS are causally associated with the onset of acquired resistance to anti-EGFR treatment in colorectal cancers. Expression of mutant KRAS under the control of its endogenous gene promoter was sufficient to confer cetuximab resistance, but resistant cells remained sensitive to combinatorial inhibition of EGFR and mitogen-activated protein-kinase kinase (MEK). Analysis of metastases from patients who developed resistance to cetuximab or panitumumab showed the emergence of KRAS amplification in one sample and acquisition of secondary KRAS mutations in 60% (6 out of 10) of the cases. KRAS mutant alleles were detectable in the blood of cetuximab-treated patients as early as 10 months before radiographic documentation of disease progression. In summary, the results identify KRAS mutations as frequent drivers of acquired resistance to cetuximab in colorectal cancers, indicate that the emergence of KRAS mutant clones can be detected non-invasively months before radiographic progression and suggest early initiation of a MEK inhibitor as a rational strategy for delaying or reversing drug resistance.","Misale, Sandra; Yaeger, Rona; Hobor, Sebastijan; Scala, Elisa; Janakiraman, Manickam; Liska, David; Valtorta, Emanuele; Schiavo, Roberta; Buscarino, Michela; Siravegna, Giulia; Bencardino, Katia; Cercek, Andrea; Chen, Chin-Tung; Veronese, Silvio; Zanon, Carlo; Sartore-Bianchi, Andrea; Gambacorta, Marcello; Gallicchio, Margherita; Vakiani, Efsevia; Boscaro, Valentina; Medico, Enzo; Weiser, Martin; Siena, Salvatore; Di Nicolantonio, Federica; Solit, David; Bardelli, Alberto","Misale, S; Yaeger, R; Hobor, S; Scala, E; Janakiraman, M; Liska, D; Valtorta, E; Schiavo, R; Buscarino, M; Siravegna, G; Bencardino, K; Cercek, A; Chen, CT; Veronese, S; Zanon, C; Sartore-Bianchi, A; Gambacorta, M; Gallicchio, M; Vakiani, E; Boscaro, V; Medico, E; Weiser, M; Siena, S; Di Nicolantonio, F; Solit, D; Bardelli, A",532.0,"[Yaeger, Rona; Cercek, Andrea; Solit, David] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Med, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Misale, Sandra; Hobor, Sebastijan; Scala, Elisa; Buscarino, Michela; Siravegna, Giulia; Zanon, Carlo; Di Nicolantonio, Federica; Bardelli, Alberto] Inst Canc Res & Treatment IRCC, Mol Genet Lab, I-10060 Turin, Italy; [Misale, Sandra; Scala, Elisa; Buscarino, Michela; Medico, Enzo; Bardelli, Alberto] Univ Torino, Sch Med, Dept Oncol Sci, I-10060 Turin, Italy; [Janakiraman, Manickam; Solit, David] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Human Oncol & Pathogenesis Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Liska, David; Chen, Chin-Tung; Weiser, Martin] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Surg, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Valtorta, Emanuele; Veronese, Silvio; Gambacorta, Marcello] Osped Niguarda Ca Granda, Dept Pathol, I-20162 Milan, Italy; [Schiavo, Roberta; Bencardino, Katia; Sartore-Bianchi, Andrea; Siena, Salvatore] Osped Niguarda Ca Granda, Falck Div Med Oncol, I-20162 Milan, Italy; [Gallicchio, Margherita; Boscaro, Valentina] Univ Turin, Dipartimento Sci & Tecnol Farmaco, I-10125 Turin, Italy; [Vakiani, Efsevia] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Medico, Enzo] Inst Canc Res & Treatment IRCC, Lab Funct Genom, I-10060 Turin, Italy; [Di Nicolantonio, Federica; Bardelli, Alberto] FIRC Inst Mol Oncol IFOM, I-20139 Milan, Italy",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11156,Article,,solitd@mskcc.org; alberto.bardelli@ircc.it,U131,"European Union [259015 COLTHERES]; Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro (AIRC) [9970]; Regione Piemonte; Fondazione Piemontese per la Ricerca sul Cancro (FPRC) Intramural Grant, 5xmille 2008, ONLUS; AIRC MFAG [11349]; Oncologia Ca' Granda ONLUS (OCGO); Commonwealth Foundation for Cancer Research; Experimental Therapeutics Center of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center; Society of MSKCC; National Institutes of Health; Beene Foundation; Regione Lombardia; Ministerio Salute grant 'Gene Mutation Monitoring in mCRC'","We are particularly indebted to S.

127,325,444.0,"Genetic and biochemical analyses of RNA interference (RNAi) and microRNA (miRNA) pathways have revealed proteins such as Argonaute and Dicer as essential cofactors that process and present small RNAs to their targets. Well-validated small RNA pathway cofactors such as these show distinctive patterns of conservation or divergence in particular animal, plant, fungal and protist species. We compared 86 divergent eukaryotic genome sequences to discern sets of proteins that show similar phylogenetic profiles with known small RNA cofactors. A large set of additional candidate small RNA cofactors have emerged from functional genomic screens for defects in miRNA-or short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated repression in Caenorhabditis elegans and Dro-sophila melanogaster(1,2), and from proteomic analyses of proteins co-purifying with validated small RNA pathway proteins(3,4). The phylogenetic profiles of many of these candidate small RNA pathway proteins are similar to those of known small RNA cofactor proteins. We used a Bayesian approach to integrate the phylogenetic profile analysis with predictions from diverse transcriptional coregulation and proteome interaction data sets to assign a probability for each protein for a role in a small RNA pathway. Testing high-confidence candidates from this analysis for defects in RNAi silencing, we found that about one-half of the predicted small RNA cofactors are required for RNAi silencing. Many of the newly identified small RNA pathway proteins are orthologues of proteins implicated in RNA splicing. In support of a deep connection between the mechanism of RNA splicing and small-RNA-mediated gene silencing, the presence of the Argonaute proteins and other small RNA components in the many species analysed strongly correlates with the number of introns in those species.","Tabach, Yuval; Billi, Allison C.; Hayes, Gabriel D.; Newman, Martin A.; Zuk, Or; Gabel, Harrison; Kamath, Ravi; Yacoby, Keren; Chapman, Brad; Garcia, Susana M.; Borowsky, Mark; Kim, John K.; Ruvkun, Gary","Tabach, Y; Billi, AC; Hayes, GD; Newman, MA; Zuk, O; Gabel, H; Kamath, R; Yacoby, K; Chapman, B; Garcia, SM; Borowsky, M; Kim, JK; Ruvkun, G",694.0,"[Tabach, Yuval; Hayes, Gabriel D.; Newman, Martin A.; Gabel, Harrison; Kamath, Ravi; Yacoby, Keren; Chapman, Brad; Garcia, Susana M.; Borowsky, Mark; Ruvkun, Gary] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Mol Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Tabach, Yuval; Hayes, Gabriel D.; Newman, Martin A.; Gabel, Harrison; Kamath, Ravi; Garcia, Susana M.; Borowsky, Mark; Ruvkun, Gary] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Billi, Allison C.; Kim, John K.] Univ Michigan, Inst Life Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Billi, Allison C.; Kim, John K.] Univ Michigan, Dept Human Genet, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Zuk, Or] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11779,Article,,ruvkun@molbio.mgh.harvard.edu,698,"NIH [GM088565, GM44619, GM098647]; Pew Charitable Trusts","We thank T.

128,346,148.0,"The ability to control and tune interactions in ultracold atomic gases has paved the way for the realization of new phases of matter. So far, experiments have achieved a high degree of control over short-range interactions, but the realization of long-range interactions has become a central focus of research because it would open up a new realm of many-body physics. Rydberg atoms are highly suited to this goal because the van der Waals forces between them are many orders of magnitude larger than those between ground-state atoms(1). Consequently, mere laser excitation of ultracold gases can cause strongly correlated many-body states to emerge directly when atoms are transferred to Rydberg states. A key example is a quantum crystal composed of coherent superpositions of different, spatially ordered configurations of collective excitations(2-5). Here we use high-resolution, in situ Rydberg atom imaging to measure directly strong correlations in a laser-excited, two-dimensional atomic Mott insulator(6). The observations reveal the emergence of spatially ordered excitation patterns with random orientation, but well-defined geometry, in the high-density components of the prepared many-body state. Together with a time-resolved analysis, this supports the description of the system in terms of a correlated quantum state of collective excitations delocalized throughout the gas. Our experiment demonstrates the potential of Rydberg gases to realize exotic phases of matter, thereby laying the basis for quantum simulations of quantum magnets with long-range interactions.","Schauss, Peter; Cheneau, Marc; Endres, Manuel; Fukuhara, Takeshi; Hild, Sebastian; Omran, Ahmed; Pohl, Thomas; Gross, Christian; Kuhr, Stefan; Bloch, Immanuel","Schauss, P; Cheneau, M; Endres, M; Fukuhara, T; Hild, S; Omran, A; Pohl, T; Gross, C; Kuhr, S; Bloch, I",87.0,"[Schauss, Peter; Cheneau, Marc; Endres, Manuel; Fukuhara, Takeshi; Hild, Sebastian; Omran, Ahmed; Gross, Christian; Kuhr, Stefan; Bloch, Immanuel] Max Planck Inst Quantum Opt, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Pohl, Thomas] Max Planck Inst Phys Komplexer Syst, D-01187 Dresden, Germany; [Kuhr, Stefan] Univ Strathclyde, Dept Phys, SUPA, Glasgow G4 0NG, Lanark, Scotland; [Bloch, Immanuel] Univ Munich, Fak Phys, D-80799 Munich, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11596,Article,,peter.schauss@mpq.mpg.de,91,MPG; DFG; EU; JSPS,"We thank R.

129,16,284.0,"Daily life continually confronts us with an exuberance of external, sensory stimuli competing with a rich stream of internal deliberations, plans and ruminations. The brain must select one or more of these for further processing. How this competition is resolved across multiple sensory and cognitive regions is not known; nor is it clear how internal thoughts and attention regulate this competition(1-4). Recording from single neurons in patients implanted with intracranial electrodes for clinical reasons(5-9), here we demonstrate that humans can regulate the activity of their neurons in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) to alter the outcome of the contest between external images and their internal representation. Subjects looked at a hybrid superposition of two images representing familiar individuals, landmarks, objects or animals and had to enhance one image at the expense of the other, competing one. Simultaneously, the spiking activity of their MTL neurons in different subregions and hemispheres was decoded in real time to control the content of the hybrid. Subjects reliably regulated, often on the first trial, the firing rate of their neurons, increasing the rate of some while simultaneously decreasing the rate of others. They did so by focusing onto one image, which gradually became clearer on the computer screen in front of their eyes, and thereby overriding sensory input. On the basis of the firing of these MTL neurons, the dynamics of the competition between visual images in the subject's mind was visualized on an external display.","Cerf, Moran; Thiruvengadam, Nikhil; Mormann, Florian; Kraskov, Alexander; Quiroga, Rodrigo Quian; Koch, Christof; Fried, Itzhak","Cerf, M; Thiruvengadam, N; Mormann, F; Kraskov, A; Quiroga, RQ; Koch, C; Fried, I",1104.0,"[Cerf, Moran; Thiruvengadam, Nikhil; Mormann, Florian; Kraskov, Alexander; Quiroga, Rodrigo Quian; Koch, Christof] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Cerf, Moran; Fried, Itzhak] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Neurosurg, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Cerf, Moran] NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Thiruvengadam, Nikhil] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Mormann, Florian] Univ Bonn, Dept Epileptol, D-53105 Bonn, Germany; [Quiroga, Rodrigo Quian] Univ Leicester, Dept Engn, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; [Koch, Christof] Korea Univ, Dept Brain & Cognit Engn, Seoul 136713, South Korea; [Fried, Itzhak] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Semel Inst Neurosci & Human Behav, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Fried, Itzhak] Tel Aviv Med Ctr & Sch Med, Funct Neurosurg Unit, IL-64239 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Fried, Itzhak] Tel Aviv Univ, Sackler Fac Med, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09510,Article,,moran@klab.caltech.edu; koch@klab.caltech.edu; ifried@mednet.ucla.edu,U115,"National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS); National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH); G.

130,172,228.0,"Transcriptional complexes that contain peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor coactivator (PGC)-1 alpha control mitochondrial oxidative function to maintain energy homeostasis in response to nutrient and hormonal signals(1,2). An important component in the energy and nutrient pathways is mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a kinase that regulates cell growth, size and survival(3-5). However, it is unknown whether and how mTOR controls mitochondrial oxidative activities. Here we show that mTOR is necessary for the maintenance of mitochondrial oxidative function. In skeletal muscle tissues and cells, the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin decreased the gene expression of the mitochondrial transcriptional regulators PGC-1 alpha, oestrogen-related receptor a and nuclear respiratory factors, resulting in a decrease in mitochondrial gene expression and oxygen consumption. Using computational genomics, we identified the transcription factor yin-yang 1 (YY1) as a common target of mTOR and PGC-1 alpha. Knockdown of YY1 caused a significant decrease in mitochondrial gene expression and in respiration, and YY1 was required for rapamycin-dependent repression of those genes. Moreover, mTOR and raptor interacted with YY1, and inhibition of mTOR resulted in a failure of YY1 to interact with and be coactivated by PGC-1 alpha. We have therefore identified a mechanism by which a nutrient sensor (mTOR) balances energy metabolism by means of the transcriptional control of mitochondrial oxidative function. These results have important implications for our understanding of how these pathways might be altered in metabolic diseases and cancer.","Cunningham, John T.; Rodgers, Joseph T.; Arlow, Daniel H.; Vazquez, Francisca; Mootha, Vamsi K.; Puigserver, Pere","Cunningham, JT; Rodgers, JT; Arlow, DH; Vazquez, F; Mootha, VK; Puigserver, P",736.0,"Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; Harvard Univ, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Sch Med, Dept Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; Harvard Univ, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Sch Med, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA; MIT, Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06322,Article,,vamsi@hms.harvard.edu; pere_puigserver@dfci.harvard.edu,U12,,,235BY,Y,N,RENAL-TRANSPLANT PATIENTS; INSULIN-RESISTANCE; AMINO-ACID; ERR-ALPHA; IN-VIVO; METABOLISM; PATHWAY; CELL; IDENTIFICATION; COACTIVATORS,7170.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,"Cunningham, John/0000-0001-6490-4533","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",29-Nov,6.0,LONDON,18046414.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007.0,,"Puigserver, P (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, 44 Binney St, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,598.0,mTOR controls mitochondrial oxidative function through a YY1-PGC-1 alpha transcriptional complex,3.0,59.0,WOS:000251209700057,228.0,450,Multidisciplinary Sciences,619,pere,puigserver,46437.0,36,male,0.97,DjD492gAAAAJ,5,"(17929, ]",15307947,1,315620,1,Jordi Bosch,Jordi Bosch,0,0
131,243,175.0,"A comprehensive account of the causes of alcohol misuse must accommodate individual differences in biology, psychology and environment, and must disentangle cause and effect. Animal models(1) can demonstrate the effects of neurotoxic substances; however, they provide limited insight into the psycho-social and higher cognitive factors involved in the initiation of substance use and progression to misuse. One can search for pre-existing risk factors by testing for endophenotypic biomarkers(2) in non-using relatives; however, these relatives may have personality or neural resilience factors that protect them from developing dependence(3). A longitudinal study has potential to identify predictors of adolescent substance misuse, particularly if it can incorporate a wide range of potential causal factors, both proximal and distal, and their influence on numerous social, psychological and biological mechanisms(4). Here we apply machine learning to a wide range of data from a large sample of adolescents (n = 692) to generate models of current and future adolescent alcohol misuse that incorporate brain structure and function, individual personality and cognitive differences, environmental factors (including gestational cigarette and alcohol exposure), life experiences, and candidate genes. These models were accurate and generalized to novel data, and point to life experiences, neurobiological differences and personality as important antecedents of binge drinking. By identifying the vulnerability factors underlying individual differences in alcohol misuse, these models shed light on the aetiology of alcohol misuse and suggest targets for prevention.","Whelan, Robert; Watts, Richard; Orr, Catherine A.; Althoff, Robert R.; Artiges, Eric; Banaschewski, Tobias; Barker, Gareth J.; Bokde, Arun L.

132,135,377.0,"Understanding inter- individual differences in stress response requires the explanation of genetic influences at multiple phenotypic levels, including complex behaviours and the metabolic responses of brain regions to emotional stimuli. Neuropeptide Y ( NPY) is anxiolytic(1,2) and its release is induced by stress(3). NPY is abundantly expressed in regions of the limbic system that are implicated in arousal and in the assignment of emotional valences to stimuli and memories(4-6). Here we show that haplotype- driven NPY expression predicts brain responses to emotional and stress challenges and also inversely correlates with trait anxiety. NPY haplotypes predicted levels of NPY messenger RNA in postmortem brain and lymphoblasts, and levels of plasma NPY. Lower haplotype- driven NPY expression predicted higher emotion- induced activation of the amygdala, as well as diminished resiliency as assessed by pain/ stress- induced activations of endogenous opioid neurotransmission in various brain regions. A single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP rs16147) located in the promoter region alters NPY expression in vitro and seems to account for more than half of the variation in expression in vivo. These convergent findings are consistent with the function of NPY as an anxiolytic peptide and help to explain inter- individual variation in resiliency to stress, a risk factor for many diseases.","Zhou, Zhifeng; Zhu, Guanshan; Hariri, Ahmad R.; Enoch, Mary-Anne; Scott, David; Sinha, Rajita; Virkkunen, Matti; Mash, Deborah C.; Lipsky, Robert H.; Hu, Xian-Zhang; Hodgkinson, Colin A.; Xu, Ke; Buzas, Beata; Yuan, Qiaoping; Shen, Pei-Hong; Ferrell, Robert E.; Manuck, Stephen B.; Brown, Sarah M.; Hauger, Richard L.; Stohler, Christian S.; Zubieta, Jon-Kar; Goldman, David","Zhou, ZF; Zhu, GS; Hariri, AR; Enoch, MA; Scott, D; Sinha, R; Virkkunen, M; Mash, DC; Lipsky, RH; Hu, XZ; Hodgkinson, CA; Xu, K; Buzas, B; Yuan, QP; Shen, PH; Ferrell, RE; Manuck, SB; Brown, SM; Hauger, RL; Stohler, CS; Zubieta, JK; Goldman, D",997.0,"[Zhou, Zhifeng; Zhu, Guanshan; Enoch, Mary-Anne; Lipsky, Robert H.; Hu, Xian-Zhang; Hodgkinson, Colin A.; Xu, Ke; Buzas, Beata; Yuan, Qiaoping; Shen, Pei-Hong; Goldman, David] NIAAA, Neurogenet Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Hariri, Ahmad R.; Ferrell, Robert E.; Manuck, Stephen B.; Brown, Sarah M.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Psychiat, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; [Hariri, Ahmad R.; Ferrell, Robert E.; Manuck, Stephen B.; Brown, Sarah M.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Human Genet, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; [Hariri, Ahmad R.; Ferrell, Robert E.; Manuck, Stephen B.; Brown, Sarah M.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Psychol, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; [Scott, David; Zubieta, Jon-Kar] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Scott, David; Zubieta, Jon-Kar] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Radiol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Sinha, Rajita] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Virkkunen, Matti] Univ Helsinki, Dept Psychiat, Helsinki 00014, Finland; [Mash, Deborah C.] Univ Miami, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Miami, FL 33124 USA; [Hauger, Richard L.] San Diego VA Healthcare Syst, Dept Psychiat, San Diego, CA 92161 USA; [Hauger, Richard L.] Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92161 USA; [Stohler, Christian S.] Univ Maryland, Sch Dent, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06858,Article,,davidgoldman@mail.nih.gov,U8,"Intramural NIH HHS [Z01 AA000301-09, Z99 AA999999]; NHLBI NIH HHS [R01 HL065137, P01 HL040962]; NIAAA NIH HHS [R01 AA013892, R01-AA13892]; NIDA NIH HHS [K02 DA017232, K02-DA17232, P50 DA016556, P50-DA16556, PL1 DA024859, PL1 DA024859-02, R01 DA 016423, R01 DA016423]; NIDCR NIH HHS [R01 DE 15396, R01 DE015396]; NIMH NIH HHS [K01 MH072837, R01 MH074697, R01 MH074697-04A1]",,291PF,,,NEUROPEPTIDE-Y DISTRIBUTION; HUMAN AMYGDALA; SEROTONIN TRANSPORTER; POLYMORPHISM; BRAIN; GENOTYPE; DISEASE; ANXIETY; PAIN; ASSOCIATION,7190.0,NATURE,Nature,English,35.0,No,"Goldman, David/0000-0002-1724-5405; Lipsky, Robert/0000-0001-7753-1473","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",24-Apr,6.0,LONDON,18385673.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,"Hariri, Ahmad/D-5761-2011; Goldman, David/F-9772-2010","Goldman, D (reprint author), NIAAA, Neurogenet Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,238.0,Genetic variation in human NPY expression affects stress response and emotion,0.0,20.0,WOS:000255208600040,377.0,452,Multidisciplinary Sciences,245,david,goldman,59529.0,12593,male,1.0,w6mUDwwAAAAJ,5,"(17929, ]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
133,7,128.0,"Ongoing efforts within synthetic and systems biology have been directed towards the building of artificial computational devices(1) using engineered biological units as basic building blocks(2,3). Such efforts, inspired in the standard design of electronic circuits(4-7), are limited by the difficulties arising from wiring the basic computational units (logic gates) through the appropriate connections, each one to be implemented by a different molecule. Here, we show that there is a logically different form of implementing complex Boolean logic computations that reduces wiring constraints thanks to a redundant distribution of the desired output among engineered cells. A practical implementation is presented using a library of engineered yeast cells, which can be combined in multiple ways. Each construct defines a logic function and combining cells and their connections allow building more complex synthetic devices. As a proof of principle, we have implemented many logic functions by using just a few engineered cells. Of note, small modifications and combination of those cells allowed for implementing more complex circuits such as a multiplexer or a 1-bit adder with carry, showing the great potential for re-utilization of small parts of the circuit. Our results support the approach of using cellular consortia as an efficient way of engineering complex tasks not easily solvable using single-cell implementations.","Regot, Sergi; Macia, Javier; Conde, Nuria; Furukawa, Kentaro; Kjellen, Jimmy; Peeters, Tom; Hohmann, Stefan; de Nadal, Eulalia; Posas, Francesc; Sole, Ricard","Regot, S; Macia, J; Conde, N; Furukawa, K; Kjellen, J; Peeters, T; Hohmann, S; de Nadal, E; Posas, F; Sole, R",207.0,"[Macia, Javier; Conde, Nuria; Sole, Ricard] UPF, ICREA Complex Syst Lab, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain; [Regot, Sergi; Conde, Nuria; Peeters, Tom; de Nadal, Eulalia; Posas, Francesc] UPF, Dept Ciencies Expt & Salut, Cell Signaling Unit, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain; [Furukawa, Kentaro; Kjellen, Jimmy; Hohmann, Stefan] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Cell & Mol Biol Microbiol, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Sole, Ricard] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA; [Sole, Ricard] UPF, CSIC, Inst Biol Evolut, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09679,Article,,francesc.posas@upf.edu; ricard.sole@upf.edu,211,"FPU (Spanish Government); James McDonnell Foundation; MICINN [BIO2009-07762, FIS2009-12365]; Consolider Ingenio 2010 programme [CSD2007-0015]; ESF [ERAS-CT-2003-980409]; CELLCOMPUT (FP6) project; FP7 UNICELLSYS [201142]; Santa Fe Institute; Fundacion Marcelino Botin (FMB); ICREA Academia (Generalitat de Catalunya); ICREA","We thank L.

134,271,22.0,"RNA interference is widely distributed in eukaryotes and has a variety of functions, including antiviral defence and gene regulation(1,2). All RNA interference pathways use small single-stranded RNA(ssRNA) molecules that guide proteins of the Argonaute (Ago) family to complementary ssRNA targets: RNA-guided RNA interference(1,2). The role of prokaryotic Ago variants has remained elusive, although bioinformatics analysis has suggested their involvement in host defence(3). Here we demonstrate that Ago of the bacterium Thermus thermophilus (TtAgo) acts as a barrier for the uptake and propagation of foreign DNA. In vivo, TtAgo is loaded with 5'-phosphorylated DNA guides, 13-25 nucleotides in length, that are mostly plasmid derived and have a strong bias for a 5'-end deoxycytidine. These small interfering DNAs guide TtAgo to cleave complementary DNA strands. Hence, despite structural homology to its eukaryotic counterparts, TtAgo functions in host defence by DNA-guided DNA interference.","Swarts, Daan C.; Jore, Matthijs M.; Westra, Edze R.; Zhu, Yifan; Janssen, Jorijn H.; Snijders, Ambrosius P.; Wang, Yanli; Patel, Dinshaw J.; Berenguer, Jose; Brouns, Stan J.

135,125,237.0,"The existence of a small population of 'cancer-initiating cells' responsible for tumour maintenance has been firmly demonstrated in leukaemia. This concept is currently being tested in solid tumours. Leukaemia-initiating cells, particularly those that are in a quiescent state, are thought to be resistant to chemotherapy and targeted therapies, resulting in disease relapse. Chronic myeloid leukaemia is a paradigmatic haematopoietic stem cell disease in which the leukaemia-initiating-cell pool is not eradicated by current therapy, leading to disease relapse on drug discontinuation. Here we define the critical role of the promyelocytic leukaemia protein (PML) tumour suppressor in haematopoietic stem cell maintenance, and present a new therapeutic approach for targeting quiescent leukaemia-initiating cells and possibly cancer-initiating cells by pharmacological inhibition of PML.","Ito, Keisuke; Bernardi, Rosa; Morotti, Alessandro; Matsuoka, Sahoko; Saglio, Giuseppe; Ikeda, Yasuo; Rosenblatt, Jacalyn; Avigan, David E.; Teruya-Feldstein, Julie; Pandolfi, Pier Paolo","Ito, K; Bernardi, R; Morotti, A; Matsuoka, S; Saglio, G; Ikeda, Y; Rosenblatt, J; Avigan, DE; Teruya-Feldstein, J; Pandolfi, PP",1072.0,"[Ito, Keisuke; Bernardi, Rosa; Morotti, Alessandro; Pandolfi, Pier Paolo] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Canc Genet Program, Beth Israel Deaconess Canc Ctr,Dept Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Ito, Keisuke; Bernardi, Rosa; Morotti, Alessandro; Pandolfi, Pier Paolo] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Canc Genet Program, Beth Israel Deaconess Canc Ctr,Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Rosenblatt, Jacalyn; Avigan, David E.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Div Hematol & Oncol, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Ito, Keisuke; Bernardi, Rosa; Morotti, Alessandro; Pandolfi, Pier Paolo] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Canc Biol & Genet Program, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Ito, Keisuke; Bernardi, Rosa; Morotti, Alessandro; Teruya-Feldstein, Julie; Pandolfi, Pier Paolo] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Matsuoka, Sahoko; Ikeda, Yasuo] Keio Univ, Sch Med, Div Hematol, Dept Internal Med,Shinjuku Ku, Tokyo 1608582, Japan; [Saglio, Giuseppe] Univ Turin, Div Hematol & Internal Med, Dept Clin & Biol Sci, I-10043 Turin, Italy",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07016,Article,,ppandolf@bidmc.harvard.edu,U4,"NCI NIH HHS [K99 CA139009, R00 CA139009, R37 CA071692, R37 CA071692-12]",,314WM,Y,N,CHRONIC MYELOGENOUS LEUKEMIA; ACUTE PROMYELOCYTIC LEUKEMIA; CHRONIC MYELOID-LEUKEMIA; HEMATOPOIETIC STEM-CELLS; IMATINIB MESYLATE DISCONTINUATION; TUMOR-SUPPRESSOR; ARSENIC TRIOXIDE; RETINOIC ACID; CANCER; REMISSION,7198.0,NATURE,Nature,English,45.0,No,"Morotti, Alessandro/0000-0002-8407-2903; Bernardi, Rosa/0000-0002-3607-6336","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",19-Jun,8.0,LONDON,18469801.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,"bernardi, rosa/B-1650-2013","Pandolfi, PP (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Canc Genet Program, Beth Israel Deaconess Canc Ctr,Dept Med, New Res Bldg,330 Brookline Ave, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,345.0,PML targeting eradicates quiescent leukaemia-initiating cells,5.0,26.0,WOS:000256839900050,237.0,453,Multidisciplinary Sciences,370,pier paolo,pandolfi,76366.0,3,male,1.0,VoWkBjUAAAAJ,5,"(17929, ]",6538458,1,6538458,1,Pier Paolo Pandolfi,Pier Paolo Pandolfi,1,1
136,309,212.0,"The violation of a Bell inequality is an experimental observation that forces the abandonment of a local realistic viewpoint-namely, one in which physical properties are (probabilistically) defined before and independently of measurement, and in which no physical influence can propagate faster than the speed of light(1,2). All such experimental violations require additional assumptions depending on their specific construction, making them vulnerable to so-called loopholes. Here we use entangled photons to violate a Bell inequality while closing the fair-sampling loophole, that is, without assuming that the sample of measured photons accurately represents the entire ensemble(3). To do this, we use the Eberhard form of Bell's inequality, which is not vulnerable to the fair-sampling assumption and which allows a lower collection efficiency than other forms(4). Technical improvements of the photon source(5,6) and high-efficiency transition-edge sensors(7) were crucial for achieving a sufficiently high collection efficiency. Our experiment makes the photon the first physical system for which each of the main loopholes has been closed, albeit in different experiments.","Giustina, Marissa; Mech, Alexandra; Ramelow, Sven; Wittmann, Bernhard; Kofler, Johannes; Beyer, Joern; Lita, Adriana; Calkins, Brice; Gerrits, Thomas; Nam, SaeWoo; Ursin, Rupert; Zeilinger, Anton","Giustina, M; Mech, A; Ramelow, S; Wittmann, B; Kofler, J; Beyer, J; Lita, A; Calkins, B; Gerrits, T; Nam, S; Ursin, R; Zeilinger, A",227.0,"[Giustina, Marissa; Mech, Alexandra; Ramelow, Sven; Wittmann, Bernhard; Kofler, Johannes; Ursin, Rupert; Zeilinger, Anton] Austrian Acad Sci, IQOQI, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Giustina, Marissa; Mech, Alexandra; Ramelow, Sven; Wittmann, Bernhard; Zeilinger, Anton] Univ Vienna, Fac Phys, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Kofler, Johannes] Max Planck Inst Quantum Opt MPQ, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Beyer, Joern] Phys Tech Bundesanstalt, D-10587 Berlin, Germany; [Lita, Adriana; Calkins, Brice; Gerrits, Thomas; Nam, SaeWoo] NIST, Boulder, CO 80305 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12012,Article,,marissa.giustina@univie.ac.at; anton.zeilinger@univie.ac.at,230,"ERC [QIT4QAD 227844]; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [SFB F4008, CoQuS]; Q-ESSENCE [248095]; QAP [15848]; Marie Curie Research Training Network EMALI [MRTN-CT-2006-035369]; John Templeton Foundation; NIST Quantum Information Science Initiative (QISI), an agency of the US Government","We acknowledge M.

137,148,23.0,"Choanoflagellates are the closest known relatives of metazoans. To discover potential molecular mechanisms underlying the evolution of metazoan multicellularity, we sequenced and analysed the genome of the unicellular choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis. The genome contains approximately 9,200 intron- rich genes, including a number that encode cell adhesion and signalling protein domains that are otherwise restricted to metazoans. Here we show that the physical linkages among protein domains often differ between M. brevicollis and metazoans, suggesting that abundant domain shuffling followed the separation of the choanoflagellate and metazoan lineages. The completion of the M. brevicollis genome allows us to reconstruct with increasing resolution the genomic changes that accompanied the origin of metazoans.","King, Nicole; Westbrook, M.

138,317,379.0,"Cancer chromosomal instability (CIN) results in an increased rate of change of chromosome number and structure and generates intratumour heterogeneity(1,2). CIN is observed in most solid tumours and is associated with both poor prognosis and drug resistance(3,4). Understanding a mechanistic basis for CIN is therefore paramount. Here we find evidence for impaired replication fork progression and increased DNA replication stress in CIN+ colorectal cancer (CRC) cells relative to CIN- CRC cells, with structural chromosome abnormalities precipitating chromosome missegregation in mitosis. We identify three new CIN-suppressor genes (PIGN (also known as MCD4), MEX3C (RKHD2) and ZNF516 (KIAA0222)) encoded on chromosome 18q that are subject to frequent copy number loss in CIN+ CRC. Chromosome 18q loss was temporally associated with aneuploidy onset at the adenoma-carcinoma transition. CIN-suppressor gene silencing leads to DNA replication stress, structural chromosome abnormalities and chromosome missegregation. Supplementing cells with nucleosides, to alleviate replication-associated damage(5), reduces the frequency of chromosome segregation errors after CIN-suppressor gene silencing, and attenuates segregation errors and DNA damage in CIN+ cells. These data implicate a central role for replication stress in the generation of structural and numerical CIN, which may inform new therapeutic approaches to limit intratumour heterogeneity.","Burrell, Rebecca A.; McClelland, Sarah E.; Endesfelder, David; Groth, Petra; Weller, Marie-Christine; Shaikh, Nadeem; Domingo, Enric; Kanu, Nnennaya; Dewhurst, Sally M.; Gronroos, Eva; Chew, Su Kit; Rowan, Andrew J.; Schenk, Arne; Sheffer, Michal; Howell, Michael; Kschischo, Maik; Behrens, Axel; Helleday, Thomas; Bartek, Jiri; Tomlinson, Ian R.; Swanton, Charles","Burrell, RA; McClelland, SE; Endesfelder, D; Groth, P; Weller, MC; Shaikh, N; Domingo, E; Kanu, N; Dewhurst, SM; Gronroos, E; Chew, SK; Rowan, AJ; Schenk, A; Sheffer, M; Howell, M; Kschischo, M; Behrens, A; Helleday, T; Bartek, J; Tomlinson, IR; Swanton, C",492.0,"[Burrell, Rebecca A.; McClelland, Sarah E.; Endesfelder, David; Shaikh, Nadeem; Kanu, Nnennaya; Dewhurst, Sally M.; Gronroos, Eva; Chew, Su Kit; Rowan, Andrew J.; Howell, Michael; Behrens, Axel; Swanton, Charles] Canc Res UK London Res Inst, London WC2A 3LY, England; [Endesfelder, David; Schenk, Arne; Kschischo, Maik] Univ Appl Sci Koblenz, Dept Math & Technol, D-53424 Remagen, Germany; [Groth, Petra; Weller, Marie-Christine; Helleday, Thomas] Karolinska lnstitutet, Sci Life Lab, Div Translat Med & Chem Biol, Dept Med Biochem & Biophys, S-17121 Stockholm, Sweden; [Domingo, Enric; Tomlinson, Ian R.] Wellcome Trust Ctr Human Genet, Mol & Populat Genet & NIHR Biomed Res Ctr, Oxford OX3 7BN, England; [Chew, Su Kit; Swanton, Charles] UCL Canc Inst, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Sheffer, Michal] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Phys Complex Syst, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Bartek, Jiri] Danish Canc Soc, Res Ctr, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Bartek, Jiri] Palacky Univ Olomouc, Inst Mol & Translat Med, CZ-77515 Olomouc, Czech Republic",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11935,Article,,charles.swanton@cancer.org.uk,496,Cancer Research UK; Medical Research Council; EU; Prostate Cancer Foundation; Breast Cancer Research Foundation; Oxford Biomedical Research Centre; Danish Cancer Society; Lundbeck Foundation; European Commission; Swedish Cancer Society; Swedish Research Council; Torsten and Ragnar Soderberg Foundation,"We thank A.

139,262,430.0,"Bacterial type IV secretion systems translocate virulence factors into eukaryotic cells(1,2), distribute genetic material between bacteria and have shown potential as a tool for the genetic modification of human cells(3). Given the complex choreography of the substrate through the secretion apparatus(4), the molecular mechanism of the type IV secretion system has proved difficult to dissect in the absence of structural data for the entire machinery. Here we use electron microscopy to reconstruct the type IV secretion system encoded by the Escherichia coli R388 conjugative plasmid. We show that eight proteins assemble in an intricate stoichiometric relationship to form an approximately 3 megadalton nanomachine that spans the entire cell envelope. The structure comprises an outer membrane-associated core complex(1) connected by a central stalk to a substantial inner membrane complex that is dominated by a battery of 12 VirB4 ATPase subunits organized as side-by-side hexameric barrels. Our results show a secretion system with markedly different architecture, and consequently mechanism, to other known bacterial secretion systems(1,4-6).","Low, Harry H.; Gubellini, Francesca; Rivera-Calzada, Angel; Braun, Nathalie; Connery, Sarah; Dujeancourt, Annick; Lu, Fang; Redzej, Adam; Fronzes, Remi; Orlova, Elena V.; Waksman, Gabriel","Low, HH; Gubellini, F; Rivera-Calzada, A; Braun, N; Connery, S; Dujeancourt, A; Lu, F; Redzej, A; Fronzes, R; Orlova, EV; Waksman, G",550.0,"[Low, Harry H.; Rivera-Calzada, Angel; Braun, Nathalie; Connery, Sarah; Lu, Fang; Redzej, Adam; Orlova, Elena V.; Waksman, Gabriel] UCL, Inst Struct & Mol Biol, London WC1E 7HX, England; [Low, Harry H.; Rivera-Calzada, Angel; Braun, Nathalie; Connery, Sarah; Lu, Fang; Redzej, Adam; Orlova, Elena V.; Waksman, Gabriel] Univ London Birkbeck Coll, London WC1E 7HX, England; [Gubellini, Francesca; Dujeancourt, Annick; Fronzes, Remi] Inst Pasteur, F-75015 Paris, France; [Gubellini, Francesca; Dujeancourt, Annick; Fronzes, Remi] CNRS, UMR 3528, F-75015 Paris, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13081,Article,1476-4687,remi.fronzes@pasteur.fr; e.orlova@mail.cryst.bbk.ac.uk; g.waksman@mail.cryst.bbk.ac.uk,+,"Wellcome Trust [098302, 079605]; Institut Pasteur; CNRS",This work was financed by grant 098302 from the Wellcome Trust to G.

140,97,195.0,"The host galaxy of the quasar SDSS J114816.641525150.3 ( at redshift z = 6.42, when the Universe was less than a billion years old) has an infrared luminosity of 2.2 x 10(13) times that of the Sun(1,2), presumably significantly powered by a massive burst of star formation(3-6). In local examples of extremely luminous galaxies, such as Arp 220, the burst of star formation is concentrated in a relatively small central region of <100 pc radius(7,8). It is not known on which scales stars are forming in active galaxies in the early Universe, at a time when they are probably undergoing their initial burst of star formation. We do know that at some early time, structures comparable to the spheroidal bulge of the Milky Way must have formed. Here we report a spatially resolved image of [CII] emission of the host galaxy of J114816.641525150.3 that demonstrates that its star- forming gas is distributed over a radius of about 750 pc around the centre. The surface density of the star formation rate averaged over this region is similar to 1,000 M. year(-1) kpc-(2). This surface density is comparable to the peak in Arp 220, although about two orders of magnitude larger in area. This vigorous star- forming event is likely to give rise to a massive spheroidal component in this system.","Walter, Fabian; Riechers, Dominik; Cox, Pierre; Neri, Roberto; Carilli, Chris; Bertoldi, Frank; Weiss, Axel; Maiolino, Roberto","Walter, F; Riechers, D; Cox, P; Neri, R; Carilli, C; Bertoldi, F; Weiss, A; Maiolino, R",699.0,"[Walter, Fabian; Riechers, Dominik] Max Planck Inst Astron, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Riechers, Dominik] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Cox, Pierre; Neri, Roberto] Inst Radio Astron Millimetr, F-38406 St Martin Dheres, France; [Carilli, Chris] Natl Radio Astron Observ, Socorro, NM 87801 USA; [Bertoldi, Frank] Argelander Inst Astron, D-53121 Bonn, Germany; [Weiss, Axel] Max Planck Inst Radioastron, D-53121 Bonn, Germany; [Maiolino, Roberto] Osserv Astron Roma, Ist Nazl Astrofis, I-00040 Monte Porzio Catone, Italy",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07681,Article,,walter@mpia.de,701,MPG (Germany); INSU/CNRS ( France); IGN (Spain); NASA; Hubble Fellowship; Space Telescope Science Institute; Max-Planck Gesellschaft; Alexander von Humboldt Stiftung; Max-Planck-Forschungspreis,"This work is based on observations carried out with the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer.

141,247,212.0,"In mammals, cytosine methylation is predominantly restricted to CpG dinudeotides and stably distributed across the genome, with local, cell-type-specific regulation directed by DNA binding factors(1-3). This comparatively static landscape is in marked contrast with the events of fertilization, during which the paternal genome is globally reprogrammed. Paternal genome demethylation includes the majority of CpGs, although methylation remains detectable at several notable features(4-7). These dynamics have been extensively characterized in the mouse, with only limited observations available in other mammals, and direct measurements are required to understand the extent to which early embryonic landscapes are conserved(8-10). We present genome-scale DNA methylation maps of human preimplantation development and embryonic stem cell derivation, confirming a transient state of global hypomethylation that includes most CpGs, while sites of residual maintenance are primarily restricted to gene bodies. Although most features share similar dynamics to those in mouse, maternally contributed methylation is divergently targeted to species-specific sets of CpG island promoters that extend beyond known imprint control regions. Retrotransposon regulation is also highly diverse, and transitions from maternally to embryonically expressed elements. Together, our data confirm that paternal genome demethylation is a general attribute of early mammalian development that is characterized by distinct modes of epigenetic regulation.","Smith, Zachary D.; Chan, Michelle M.; Humm, Kathryn C.; Karnik, Rahul; Mekhoubad, Shila; Regev, Aviv; Eggan, Kevin; Meissner, Alexander","Smith, ZD; Chan, MM; Humm, KC; Karnik, R; Mekhoubad, S; Regev, A; Eggan, K; Meissner, A",611.0,"[Smith, Zachary D.; Chan, Michelle M.; Karnik, Rahul; Regev, Aviv; Eggan, Kevin; Meissner, Alexander] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Smith, Zachary D.; Karnik, Rahul; Eggan, Kevin; Meissner, Alexander] Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Smith, Zachary D.; Humm, Kathryn C.; Karnik, Rahul; Mekhoubad, Shila; Eggan, Kevin; Meissner, Alexander] Harvard Univ, Dept Stem Cell & Regenerat Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Smith, Zachary D.; Mekhoubad, Shila; Eggan, Kevin] Harvard Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Chan, Michelle M.] MIT, Computat & Syst Biol Program, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Humm, Kathryn C.] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Div Reprod Endocrinol & Infertil, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Humm, Kathryn C.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Humm, Kathryn C.] Boston IVF, Waltham, MA 02451 USA; [Humm, Kathryn C.; Regev, Aviv] MIT, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Regev, Aviv] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Eggan, Kevin] Harvard Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13581,Article,1476-4687,keggan@scrb.harvard.edu; alexander_meissner@harvard.edu,+,Harvard Stem Cell Institute; NIH Pioneer Award [5DP10D003958]; Burroughs Wellcome Career Award at the Scientific Interface; HHMI; Center for Excellence in Genome Science from the NHGRI [1P50HG006193-01]; New York Stem Cell Foundation;  [P01GM099117],"We would like to thank all members of the Meissner, Regev and Eggan laboratories, in particular M.

142,5,108.0,"Supermassive black holes have been detected in all galaxies that contain bulge components when the galaxies observed were close enough that the searches were feasible. Together with the observation that bigger black holes live in bigger bulges(1-4), this has led to the belief that black-hole growth and bulge formation regulate each other(5). That is, black holes and bulges coevolve. Therefore, reports(6,7) of a similar correlation between black holes and the dark matter haloes in which visible galaxies are embedded have profound implications. Dark matter is likely to be non-baryonic, so these reports suggest that unknown, exotic physics controls black-hole growth. Here we show, in part on the basis of recent measurements(8) of bulgeless galaxies, that there is almost no correlation between dark matter and parameters that measure black holes unless the galaxy also contains a bulge. We conclude that black holes do not correlate directly with dark matter. They do not correlate with galaxy disks, either(9,10). Therefore, black holes coevolve only with bulges. This simplifies the puzzle of their coevolution by focusing attention on purely baryonic processes in the galaxy mergers that make bulges(11).","Kormendy, John; Bender, Ralf","Kormendy, J; Bender, R",377.0,"[Kormendy, John] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Astron, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Kormendy, John; Bender, Ralf] Max Planck Inst Extraterr Phys, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Kormendy, John; Bender, Ralf] Univ Sternwarte, D-81679 Munich, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09695,Article,,kormendy@astro.as.utexas.edu,380,National Science Foundation,"We thank S.

143,210,71.0,"One of the most important questions in biology is how transcription factors (TFs) and cofactors control enhancer function and thus gene expression. Enhancer activation usually requires combinations of several TFs(1), indicating that TFs function synergistically and combinatorially(2,3). However, while TF binding has been extensively studied, little is known about how combinations of TFs and cofactors control enhancer function once they are bound. It is typically unclear which TFs participate in combinatorial enhancer activation, whether different TFs form functionally distinct groups, or if certain TFs might substitute for each other in defined enhancer contexts. Here we assess the potential regulatory contributions of TFs and cofactors to combinatorial enhancer control with enhancer complementation assays. We recruited GAL4-DNA-binding-domain fusions of 812 Drosophila TFs and cofactors to 24 enhancer contexts and measured enhancer activities by 82,752 luciferase assays in S2 cells. Most factors were functional in at least one context, yet their contributions differed between contexts and varied from repression to activation (up to 289-fold) for individual factors. Based on functional similarities across contexts, we define 15 groups of TFs that differ in developmental functions and protein sequence features. Similar TFs can substitute for each other, enabling enhancer re-engineering by exchanging TF motifs, and TF-cofactor pairs cooperate during enhancer control and interact physically. Overall, we show that activators and repressors can have diverse regulatory functions that typically depend on the enhancer context. The systematic functional characterization of TFs and cofactors should further our understanding of combinatorial enhancer control and gene regulation.","Stampfel, Gerald; Kazmar, Tomas; Frank, Olga; Wienerroither, Sebastian; Reiter, Franziska; Stark, Alexander","Stampfel, G; Kazmar, T; Frank, O; Wienerroither, S; Reiter, F; Stark, A",147.0,"[Stampfel, Gerald; Kazmar, Tomas; Frank, Olga; Wienerroither, Sebastian; Reiter, Franziska; Stark, Alexander] Vienna Bioctr VBC, Res Inst Mol Pathol IMP, A-1030 Vienna, Austria",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15545,Article,1476-4687,stark@starklab.org,+,European Research Council (ERC) [242922]; Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH; Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG),"We are grateful to K.

144,266,450.0,"Activated RAS GTPase signalling is a critical driver of oncogenic transformation and malignant disease. Cellular models of RAS-dependent cancers have been used to identify experimental small molecules, such as SCH51344, but their molecular mechanism of action remains generally unknown. Here, using a chemical proteomic approach, we identify the target of SCH51344 as the human mutT homologue MTH1 (also known as NUDT1), a nucleotide pool sanitizing enzyme. Loss-of-function of MTH1 impaired growth of KRAS tumour cells, whereas MTH1 overexpression mitigated sensitivity towards SCH51344. Searching for more drug-like inhibitors, we identified the kinase inhibitor crizotinib as a nanomolar suppressor of MTH1 activity. Surprisingly, the clinically used (R)-enantiomer of the drug was inactive, whereas the (S)-enantiomer selectively inhibited MTH1 catalytic activity. Enzymatic assays, chemical proteomic profiling, kinome-wide activity surveys and MTH1 co-crystal structures of both enantiomers provide a rationale for this remarkable stereospecificity. Disruption of nucleotide pool homeostasis via MTH1 inhibition by (S)-crizotinib induced an increase in DNA single-strand breaks, activated DNA repair in human colon carcinoma cells, and effectively suppressed tumour growth in animal models. Our results propose (S)-crizotinib as an attractive chemical entity for further pre-clinical evaluation, and small-molecule inhibitors of MTH1 in general as a promising novel class of anticancer agents.","Huber, Kilian V.

145,255,308.0,"Targeted genome editing by artificial nucleases has brought the goal of site-specific transgene integration and gene correction within the reach of gene therapy. However, its application to long-term repopulating haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) has remained elusive. Here we show that poor permissiveness to gene transfer and limited proficiency of the homology-directed DNA repair pathway constrain gene targeting in human HSCs. By tailoring delivery platforms and culture conditions we overcame these barriers and provide stringent evidence of targeted integration in human HSCs by long-term multilineage repopulation of transplanted mice. We demonstrate the therapeutic potential of our strategy by targeting a corrective complementary DNA into the IL2RG gene of HSCs from healthy donors and a subject with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID-X1). Gene-edited HSCs sustained normal haematopoiesis and gave rise to functional lymphoid cells that possess a selective growth advantage over those carrying disruptive IL2RG mutations.

146,327,464.0,"Hyperconnectivity of neuronal circuits due to increased synaptic protein synthesis is thought to cause autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is strongly implicated in ASDs by means of upstream signalling; however, downstream regulatory mechanisms are ill-defined. Here we show that knockout of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 2 (4E-BP2)-an eIF4E repressor downstream of mTOR-or eIF4E overexpression leads to increased translation of neuroligins, which are postsynaptic proteins that are causally linked to ASDs. Mice that have the gene encoding 4E-BP2 (Eif4ebp2) knocked out exhibit an increased ratio of excitatory to inhibitory synaptic inputs and autistic-like behaviours (that is, social interaction deficits, altered communication and repetitive/stereotyped behaviours). Pharmacological inhibition of eIF4E activity or normalization of neuroligin 1, but not neuroligin 2, protein levels restores the normal excitation/inhibition ratio and rectifies the social behaviour deficits. Thus, translational control by eIF4E regulates the synthesis of neuroligins, maintaining the excitation-to-inhibition balance, and its dysregulation engenders ASD-like phenotypes.","Gkogkas, Christos G.; Khoutorsky, Arkady; Ran, Israeli; Rampakakis, Emmanouil; Nevarko, Tatiana; Weatherill, Daniel B.; Vasuta, Cristina; Yee, Stephanie; Truitt, Morgan; Dallaire, Paul; Major, Francois; Lasko, Paul; Ruggero, Davide; Nader, Karim; Lacaille, Jean-Claude; Sonenberg, Nahum","Gkogkas, CG; Khoutorsky, A; Ran, I; Rampakakis, E; Nevarko, T; Weatherill, DB; Vasuta, C; Yee, S; Truitt, M; Dallaire, P; Major, F; Lasko, P; Ruggero, D; Nader, K; Lacaille, JC; Sonenberg, N",371.0,"[Gkogkas, Christos G.; Khoutorsky, Arkady; Rampakakis, Emmanouil; Nevarko, Tatiana; Sonenberg, Nahum] McGill Univ, Dept Biochem, Montreal, PQ H3A 1A3, Canada; [Gkogkas, Christos G.; Khoutorsky, Arkady; Rampakakis, Emmanouil; Nevarko, Tatiana; Sonenberg, Nahum] McGill Univ, Goodman Canc Res Ctr, Montreal, PQ H3A 1A3, Canada; [Ran, Israeli; Weatherill, Daniel B.; Vasuta, Cristina; Lacaille, Jean-Claude] Univ Montreal, GRSNC, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Ran, Israeli; Weatherill, Daniel B.; Vasuta, Cristina; Lacaille, Jean-Claude] Univ Montreal, Dept Physiol, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Rampakakis, Emmanouil] JSS Med Res Inc, Montreal, PQ H4S 1N8, Canada; [Yee, Stephanie; Lasko, Paul] McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H3G 0B1, Canada; [Truitt, Morgan; Ruggero, Davide] Univ Calif San Francisco, Sch Med, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Truitt, Morgan; Ruggero, Davide] Univ Calif San Francisco, Helen Diller Family Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dept Urol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Dallaire, Paul; Major, Francois] Univ Montreal, Dept Comp Sci, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Dallaire, Paul; Major, Francois] Univ Montreal, Inst Res Immunol & Canc, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Nader, Karim] McGill Univ, Dept Psychol, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11628,Article,,jean-claude.lacaille@umontreal.ca; nahum.sonenberg@mcgill.ca,U113,"Canadian Institutes of Health Research [MOP-114994, MOP-10848, MOP-93679, MOP-44050]; Autism Speaks [7109]; Fonds de la Recherche en Sante du Quebec (FRSQ; Groupe de Recherche sur le Systeme Nerveux Central); National Institutes of Health [NIH RO1 CA154916, NIH RO1 CA140456]; Canada Research Chair in Cellular and Molecular Neurophysiology; Savoy Foundation","This work was supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (N.S., MOP-114994; J.-C.L., MOP-10848; P.D. and F.M., MOP-93679; and P.L. and N.S., MOP-44050), Autism Speaks (Grant 7109 to N.S.), and the Fonds de la Recherche en Sante du Quebec (J.-C.L.

147,288,260.0,"Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that affects 15-30% of children and approximately 5% of adults in industrialized countries(1). Although the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis is not fully understood, the disease is mediated by an abnormal immunoglobulin E immune response in the setting of skin barrier dysfunction(2). Mast cells contribute to immunoglobulin-E-mediated allergic disorders including atopic dermatitis(3). Upon activation, mast cells release their membrane-bound cytosolic granules leading to the release of several molecules that are important in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis and host defence(4). More than 90% of patients with atopic dermatitis are colonized with Staphylococcus aureus in the lesional skin whereas most healthy individuals do not harbour the pathogen(5). Several staphylococcal exotoxins can act as superantigens and/or antigens in models of atopic dermatitis(6). However, the role of these staphylococcal exotoxins in disease pathogenesis remains unclear. Here we report that culture supernatants of S. aureus contain potent mast-cell degranulation activity. Biochemical analysis identified delta-toxin as the mast cell degranulation-inducing factor produced by S. aureus. Mast cell degranulation induced by delta-toxin depended on phosphoinositide 3-kinase and calcium (Ca2+) influx; however, unlike that mediated by immunoglobulin-E crosslinking, it did not require the spleen tyrosine kinase. In addition, immunoglobulin-E enhanced delta-toxin-induced mast cell degranulation in the absence of antigen. Furthermore, S. aureus isolates recovered from patients with atopic dermatitis produced large amounts of delta-toxin. Skin colonization with S. aureus, but not a mutant deficient in delta-toxin, promoted immunoglobulin-E and interleukin-4 production, as well as inflammatory skin disease. Furthermore, enhancement of immunoglobulin E production and dermatitis by delta-toxin was abrogated in Kit(W-sh/W-sh) mast-cell-deficient mice and restored by mast cell reconstitution. These studies identify delta-toxin as a potent inducer of mast cell degranulation and suggest a mechanistic link between S. aureus colonization and allergic skin disease.","Nakamura, Yuumi; Oscherwitz, Jon; Cease, Kemp B.; Chan, Susana M.; Munoz-Planillo, Raul; Hasegawa, Mizuho; Villaruz, Amer E.; Cheung, Gordon Y.

148,298,477.0,"DNA methylation is a defining feature of mammalian cellular identity and is essential for normal development(1,2). Most cell types, except germ cells and pre-implantation embryos(3-5), display relatively stable DNA methylation patterns, with 70-80% of all CpGs being methylated(6). Despite recent advances, we still have a limited understanding of when, where and how many CpGs participate in genomic regulation. Here we report the in-depth analysis of 42 whole-genome bisulphite sequencing data sets across 30 diverse human cell and tissue types. We observe dynamic regulation for only 21.8% of autosomal CpGs within a normal developmental context, most of which are distal to transcription start sites. These dynamic CpGs co-localize with gene regulatory elements, particularly enhancers and transcription-factor-binding sites, which allow identification of key lineage-specific regulators. In addition, differentially methylated regions (DMRs) often contain single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with cell-type-related diseases as determined by genome-wide association studies. The results also highlight the general inefficiency of whole-genome bisulphite sequencing, as 70-80% of the sequencing reads across these data sets provided little or no relevant information about CpG methylation. To demonstrate further the utility of our DMR set, we use it to classify unknown samples and identify representative signature regions that recapitulate major DNA methylation dynamics. In summary, although in theory every CpG can change its methylation state, our results suggest that only a fraction does so as part of coordinated regulatory programs. Therefore, our selected DMRs can serve as a starting point to guide new, more effective reduced representation approaches to capture the most informative fraction of CpGs, as well as further pinpoint putative regulatory elements.","Ziller, Michael J.; Gu, Hongcang; Mueller, Fabian; Donaghey, Julie; Tsai, Linus T. -Y.; Kohlbacher, Oliver; De Jager, Philip L.; Rosen, Evan D.; Bennett, David A.; Bernstein, Bradley E.; Gnirke, Andreas; Meissner, Alexander","Ziller, MJ; Gu, HC; Muller, F; Donaghey, J; Tsai, LTY; Kohlbacher, O; De Jager, PL; Rosen, ED; Bennett, DA; Bernstein, BE; Gnirke, A; Meissner, A",477.0,"[Ziller, Michael J.; Gu, Hongcang; Donaghey, Julie; De Jager, Philip L.; Rosen, Evan D.; Bernstein, Bradley E.; Gnirke, Andreas; Meissner, Alexander] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Ziller, Michael J.; Donaghey, Julie; Meissner, Alexander] Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Ziller, Michael J.; Mueller, Fabian; Donaghey, Julie; Meissner, Alexander] Harvard Univ, Dept Stem Cell & Regenerat Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Tsai, Linus T. -Y.; Rosen, Evan D.] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Div Endocrinol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Kohlbacher, Oliver] Univ Tubingen, Ctr Bioinformat, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany; [Kohlbacher, Oliver] Univ Tubingen, Quantitat Biol Ctr, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany; [De Jager, Philip L.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Inst Neurosci, Program Translat NeuroPsychiat Genom, Dept Neurol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [De Jager, Philip L.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Inst Neurosci, Program Translat NeuroPsychiat Genom, Dept Psychiat, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Bennett, David A.] Rush Univ, Med Ctr, Rush Alzheimers Dis Ctr, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; [Bernstein, Bradley E.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02114 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12433,Article,,alexander_meissner@harvard.edu,481,"National Institutes of Health (NIH) Roadmap Epigenomics Project [ES017690]; NIH [P30AG10161, R01AG17917, R01AG15819, R01AG36042, U01ES017155, P01GM099117]; Pew Charitable Trusts; New York Stem Cell Foundation","We would like to thank K.

149,50,254.0,"The vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) are major angiogenic regulators and are involved in several aspects of endothelial cell physiology(1). However, the detailed role of VEGF-B in blood vessel function has remained unclear(2,3). Here we show that VEGF-B has an unexpected role in endothelial targeting of lipids to peripheral tissues. Dietary lipids present in circulation have to be transported through the vascular endothelium to be metabolized by tissue cells, a mechanism that is poorly understood(4). Bioinformatic analysis showed that Vegfb was tightly co-expressed with nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes across a large variety of physiological conditions in mice, pointing to a role for VEGF-B in metabolism. VEGF-B specifically controlled endothelial uptake of fatty acids via transcriptional regulation of vascular fatty acid transport proteins. As a consequence, Vegfb(-/-) mice showed less uptake and accumulation of lipids in muscle, heart and brown adipose tissue, and instead shunted lipids to white adipose tissue. This regulation was mediated by VEGF receptor 1 and neuropilin 1 expressed by the endothelium. The co-expression of VEGF-B and mitochondrial proteins introduces a novel regulatory mechanism, whereby endothelial lipid uptake and mitochondrial lipid use are tightly coordinated. The involvement of VEGF-B in lipid uptake may open up the possibility for novel strategies to modulate pathological lipid accumulation in diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular diseases.","Hagberg, Carolina E.; Falkevall, Annelie; Wang, Xun; Larsson, Erik; Huusko, Jenni; Nilsson, Ingrid; van Meeteren, Laurens A.; Samen, Erik; Lu, Li; Vanwildemeersch, Maarten; Klar, Joakim; Genove, Guillem; Pietras, Kristian; Stone-Elander, Sharon; Claesson-Welsh, Lena; Yla-Herttuala, Seppo; Lindahl, Per; Eriksson, Ulf","Hagberg, CE; Falkevall, A; Wang, X; Larsson, E; Huusko, J; Nilsson, I; van Meeteren, LA; Samen, E; Lu, L; Vanwildemeersch, M; Klar, J; Genove, G; Pietras, K; Stone-Elander, S; Claesson-Welsh, L; Yla-Herttuala, S; Lindahl, P; Eriksson, U",917.0,"[Hagberg, Carolina E.; Falkevall, Annelie; Wang, Xun; Nilsson, Ingrid; Vanwildemeersch, Maarten; Pietras, Kristian; Eriksson, Ulf] Karolinska Inst, Tissue Biol Grp, Div Matrix Biol, Dept Med Biochem & Biophys, SE-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Hagberg, Carolina E.; Falkevall, Annelie; Wang, Xun; Vanwildemeersch, Maarten; Klar, Joakim; Pietras, Kristian; Eriksson, Ulf] Ludwig Inst Canc Res Ltd, Stockholm Branch, Karolinska Inst, SE-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Larsson, Erik; Lindahl, Per] Univ Gothenburg, Inst Biomed, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Huusko, Jenni; Yla-Herttuala, Seppo] Univ Kuopio, AI Virtanen Inst, Dept Biotechnol & Mol Med, FIN-70211 Kuopio, Finland; [van Meeteren, Laurens A.; Klar, Joakim; Claesson-Welsh, Lena] Uppsala Univ, Rudbeck Lab, Dept Genet & Pathol, SE-75185 Uppsala, Sweden; [Samen, Erik; Stone-Elander, Sharon] Karolinska Pharm, Karolinska Univ Hosp, SE-17176 Stockholm, Sweden; [Samen, Erik; Lu, Li; Stone-Elander, Sharon] Karolinska Inst, SE-17176 Stockholm, Sweden; [Genove, Guillem] Karolinska Inst, Lab Vasc Biol, Div Matrix Biol, Dept Med Biochem & Biophys, SE-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Lindahl, Per] Sahlgrens Univ Hosp, Wallenberg Lab Cardiovasc Res, SE-41345 Gothenburg, Sweden",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08945,Article,,ulf.pe.eriksson@ki.se,U136,Wilhelm och Else Stockmanns Stiftelse; Frans Wilhelm och Waldemar von Frenckells fond; European Commission [LSHG-CT-2004-503573]; Dutch Cancer Society; Novo Nordisk Foundation; Swedish Cancer Foundation; Swedish Research Council; Dr. Peter Wallenbergs Foundation for Economics and Technology; LeDucq Foundation; Swedish Brain Foundation and Hallstens Forskningsstiftelse; Karolinska Institutet,"We thank S.

150,79,496.0,"With polar temperatures, similar to 3-5 degrees C warmer than today, the last interglacial stage (similar to 125 kyr ago) serves as a partial analogue for 1-2 degrees C global warming scenarios. Geological records from several sites indicate that local sea levels during the last interglacial were higher than today, but because local sea levels differ from global sea level, accurately reconstructing past global sea level requires an integrated analysis of globally distributed data sets. Here we present an extensive compilation of local sea level indicators and a statistical approach for estimating global sea level, local sea levels, ice sheet volumes and their associated uncertainties. We find a 95% probability that global sea level peaked at least 6.6 m higher than today during the last interglacial; it is likely (67% probability) to have exceeded 8.0 m but is unlikely (33% probability) to have exceeded 9.4 m. When global sea level was close to its current level (>=-10 m), the millennial average rate of global sea level rise is very likely to have exceeded 5.6 m kyr(-1) but is unlikely to have exceeded 9.2 m kyr(-1). Our analysis extends previous last interglacial sea level studies by integrating literature observations within a probabilistic framework that accounts for the physics of sea level change. The results highlight the long-term vulnerability of ice sheets to even relatively low levels of sustained global warming.","Kopp, Robert E.; Simons, Frederik J.; Mitrovica, Jerry X.; Maloof, Adam C.; Oppenheimer, Michael","Kopp, RE; Simons, FJ; Mitrovica, JX; Maloof, AC; Oppenheimer, M",863.0,"[Kopp, Robert E.; Simons, Frederik J.; Maloof, Adam C.; Oppenheimer, Michael] Princeton Univ, Dept Geosci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Kopp, Robert E.; Oppenheimer, Michael] Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Mitrovica, Jerry X.] Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08686,Article,1476-4687,rkopp@alumni.caltech.edu,U51,"Princeton Institute for Computational Science and Engineering; Princeton University Office of Information Technology; Science, Technology, and Environmental Policy","We thank J.

Here we investigate budding yeast APC/C using single-particle electron microscopy and determine a cryo-electron microscopy map of APC/C in complex with the Cdh1 co-activator protein (APC/C-Cdh1) bound to a D-box peptide at similar to 10 angstrom resolution. We find that a combined catalytic and substrate-recognition module is located within the central cavity of the APC/C assembled from Cdh1, Apc10-a core APC/C subunit previously implicated in substrate recognition(5-7)-and the cullin domain of Apc2. Cdh1 and Apc10, identified from difference maps, create a co-receptor for the D-box following repositioning of Cdh1 towards Apc10. Using NMR spectroscopy we demonstrate specific D-box-Apc10 interactions, consistent with a role for Apc10 in directly contributing towards D-box recognition by the APC/C-Cdh1 complex. Our results rationalize the contribution of both co-activator and core APC/C subunits to D-box recognition(8,9) and provide a structural framework for understanding mechanisms of substrate recognition and catalysis by the APC/C.","da Fonseca, Paula C.

152,315,297.0,"About 8,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent, a spontaneous hybridization of the wild diploid grass Aegilops tauschii (2n = 14; DD) with the cultivated tetraploid wheat Triticum turgidum (2n = 4x = 28; AABB) resulted in hexaploid wheat (T. aestivum; 2n = 6x = 42; AABBDD)(1,2). Wheat has since become a primary staple crop worldwide as a result of its enhanced adaptability to a wide range of climates and improved grain quality for the production of baker's flour(2). Here we describe sequencing the Ae. tauschii genome and obtaining a roughly 90-fold depth of short reads from libraries with various insert sizes, to gain a better understanding of this genetically complex plant. The assembled scaffolds represented 83.4% of the genome, of which 65.9% comprised transposable elements. We generated comprehensive RNA-Seq data and used it to identify 43,150 protein-coding genes, of which 30,697 (71.1%) were uniquely anchored to chromosomes with an integrated high-density genetic map. Whole-genome analysis revealed gene family expansion in Ae. tauschii of agronomically relevant gene families that were associated with disease resistance, abiotic stress tolerance and grain quality. This draft genome sequence provides insight into the environmental adaptation of bread wheat and can aid in defining the large and complicated genomes of wheat species.","Jia, Jizeng; Zhao, Shancen; Kong, Xiuying; Li, Yingrui; Zhao, Guangyao; He, Weiming; Appels, Rudi; Pfeifer, Matthias; Tao, Yong; Zhang, Xueyong; Jing, Ruilian; Zhang, Chi; Ma, Youzhi; Gao, Lifeng; Gao, Chuan; Spannagl, Manuel; Mayer, Klaus F.
