0,81,273.0,"Tuberculosis remains second only to HIV/AIDS as the leading cause of mortality worldwide due to a single infectious agent(1). Despite chemotherapy, the global tuberculosis epidemic has intensified because of HIV co-infection, the lack of an effective vaccine and the emergence of multi-drug-resistant bacteria(2-5). Alternative host-directed strategies could be exploited to improve treatment efficacy and outcome, contain drug-resistant strains and reduce disease severity and mortality(6). The innate inflammatory response elicited by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) represents a logical host target(7). Here we demonstrate that interleukin-1 (IL-1) confers host resistance through the induction of eicosanoids that limit excessive type I interferon (IFN) production and foster bacterial containment. We further show that, in infected mice and patients, reduced IL-1 responses and/or excessive type I IFN induction are linked to an eicosanoid imbalance associated with disease exacerbation. Host-directed immunotherapy with clinically approved drugs that augment prostaglandin E2 levels in these settings prevented acute mortality of Mtb-infected mice. Thus, IL-1 and type I IFNs represent two major counter-regulatory classes of inflammatory cytokines that control the outcome of Mtb infection and are functionally linked via eicosanoids. Our findings establish proof of concept for host-directed treatment strategies that manipulate the host eicosanoid network and represent feasible alternatives to conventional chemotherapy.","Mayer-Barber, Katrin D.; Andrade, Bruno B.; Oland, Sandra D.; Amaral, Eduardo P.; Barber, Daniel L.; Gonzales, Jacqueline; Derrick, Steven C.; Shi, Ruiru; Kumar, Nathella Pavan; Wei, Wang; Yuan, Xing; Zhang, Guolong; Cai, Ying; Babu, Subash; Catalfamo, Marta; Salazar, Andres M.; Via, Laura E.; Barry, Clifton E., III; Sher, Alan","Mayer-Barber, KD; Andrade, BB; Oland, SD; Amaral, EP; Barber, DL; Gonzales, J; Derrick, SC; Shi, RR; Kumar, NP; Wei, W; Yuan, X; Zhang, GL; Cai, Y; Babu, S; Catalfamo, M; Salazar, AM; Via, LE; Barry, CE; Sher, A",99.0,"[Mayer-Barber, Katrin D.; Andrade, Bruno B.; Oland, Sandra D.; Amaral, Eduardo P.; Sher, Alan] NIAID, Immunobiol Sect, LPD, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Amaral, Eduardo P.] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Biomed Sci, Dept Immunol, BR-05508900 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Barber, Daniel L.] NIAID, Lymphocyte Biol Unit T, LPD, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Gonzales, Jacqueline; Via, Laura E.; Barry, Clifton E., III] NIAID, TB Res Sect, Lab Clin Infect Dis, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Derrick, Steven C.] US FDA, Ctr Biol Evaluat & Res, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Shi, Ruiru; Wei, Wang; Yuan, Xing] Henan Chest Hosp, Zhengzhou 450003, Peoples R China; [Kumar, Nathella Pavan; Babu, Subash] Int Ctr Excellence Res, NIH, Madras 600031, Tamil Nadu, India; [Kumar, Nathella Pavan] NIRT, Madras 600031, Tamil Nadu, India; [Zhang, Guolong] SinoUS Int Res Ctr TB, Zhengzhou 450003, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Guolong] Henan Publ Hlth Ctr, Zhengzhou 450003, Peoples R China; [Babu, Subash] NIAID, Helminth Immunol Sect, LPD, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Catalfamo, Marta] NIAID, Clin & Mol Retrovirol Sect, Immunoregulat Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Salazar, Andres M.] Oncovir Inc, Washington, DC 20008 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13489,Article,1476-4687,mayerk@niaid.nih.gov,U491,"NIAID Intramural Research program; Concept Acceleration Program-Award from DMID, NIAID","This work was supported by the NIAID Intramural Research program and a Concept Acceleration Program-Award (K.D.M.-B., B.B.A. and A.S.) from DMID, NIAID.

1,12,256.0,"Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), retrovirus-like elements with long terminal repeats, are widely dispersed in the euchromatic compartment in mammalian cells, comprising similar to 10% of the mouse genome(1). These parasitic elements are responsible for >10% of spontaneous mutations(2). Whereas DNA methylation has an important role in proviral silencing in somatic and germ-lineage cells(3-5), an additional DNA-methylation-independent pathway also functions in embryonal carcinoma and embryonic stem (ES) cells to inhibit transcription of the exogenous gammaretrovirus murine leukaemia virus (MLV)(6-8). Notably, a recent genome-wide study revealed that ERVs are also marked by histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) and H4K20me3 in ES cells but not in mouse embryonic fibroblasts(9). However, the role that these marks have in proviral silencing remains unexplored. Here we show that the H3K9 methyltransferase ESET (also called SETDB1 or KMT1E) and the Kruppel-associated box (KRAB)associated protein 1 (KAP1, also called TRIM28)(10,11) are required for H3K9me3 and silencing of endogenous and introduced retroviruses specifically in mouse ES cells. Furthermore, whereas ESET enzymatic activity is crucial for HP1 binding and efficient proviral silencing, the H4K20 methyltransferases Suv420h1 and Suv420h2 are dispensable for silencing. Notably, in DNA methyltransferase triple knockout (Dnmt1(-/-) Dnmt3a(-/-) Dnmt3b(-/-)) mouse ES cells, ESET and KAP1 binding and ESET-mediated H3K9me3 are maintained and ERVs are minimally derepressed. We propose that a DNA-methylation-independent pathway involving KAP1 and ESET/ESET-mediated H3K9me3 is required for proviral silencing during the period early in embryogenesis when DNA methylation is dynamically reprogrammed.","Matsui, Toshiyuki; Leung, Danny; Miyashita, Hiroki; Maksakova, Irina A.; Miyachi, Hitoshi; Kimura, Hiroshi; Tachibana, Makoto; Lorincz, Matthew C.; Shinkai, Yoichi","Matsui, T; Leung, D; Miyashita, H; Maksakova, IA; Miyachi, H; Kimura, H; Tachibana, M; Lorincz, MC; Shinkai, Y",927.0,"[Matsui, Toshiyuki; Miyashita, Hiroki; Miyachi, Hitoshi; Tachibana, Makoto; Shinkai, Yoichi] Kyoto Univ, Inst Virus Res, Expt Res Ctr Infect Dis, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068507, Japan; [Matsui, Toshiyuki; Miyashita, Hiroki; Tachibana, Makoto; Shinkai, Yoichi] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Biostudies, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068507, Japan; [Leung, Danny; Maksakova, Irina A.; Lorincz, Matthew C.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Med Genet, Inst Life Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada; [Kimura, Hiroshi] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Frontier Biosci, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08858,Article,,mlorincz@interchange.ubc.ca; yshinkai@virus.kyoto-u.ac.jp,U149,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan; CIHR [77805, 92090]","We thank M.

2,46,202.0,"Somatic alterations in cellular DNA underlie almost all human cancers(1). The prospect of targeted therapies(2) and the development of high-resolution, genome-wide approaches(3-8) are now spurring systematic efforts to characterize cancer genomes. Here we report a large-scale project to characterize copy-number alterations in primary lung adenocarcinomas. By analysis of a large collection of tumours ( n = 371) using dense single nucleotide polymorphism arrays, we identify a total of 57 significantly recurrent events. We find that 26 of 39 autosomal chromosome arms show consistent large-scale copy-number gain or loss, of which only a handful have been linked to a specific gene. We also identify 31 recurrent focal events, including 24 amplifications and 7 homozygous deletions. Only six of these focal events are currently associated with known mutations in lung carcinomas. The most common event, amplification of chromosome 14q13.3, is found in similar to 12% of samples. On the basis of genomic and functional analyses, we identify NKX2-1 ( NK2 homeobox 1, also called TITF1), which lies in the minimal 14q13.3 amplification interval and encodes a lineage-specific transcription factor, as a novel candidate proto-oncogene involved in a significant fraction of lung adenocarcinomas. More generally, our results indicate that many of the genes that are involved in lung adenocarcinoma remain to be discovered.","Weir, Barbara A.; Woo, Michele S.; Getz, Gad; Perner, Sven; Ding, Li; Beroukhim, Rameen; Lin, William M.; Province, Michael A.; Kraja, Aldi; Johnson, Laura A.; Shah, Kinjal; Sato, Mitsuo; Thomas, Roman K.; Barletta, Justine A.; Borecki, Ingrid B.; Broderick, Stephen; Chang, Andrew C.; Chiang, Derek Y.; Chirieac, Lucian R.; Cho, Jeonghee; Fujii, Yoshitaka; Gazdar, Adi F.; Giordano, Thomas; Greulich, Heidi; Hanna, Megan; Johnson, Bruce E.; Kris, Mark G.; Lash, Alex; Lin, Ling; Lindeman, Neal; Mardis, Elaine R.; McPherson, John D.; Minna, John D.; Morgan, Margaret B.; Nadel, Mark; Orringer, Mark B.; Osborne, John R.; Ozenberger, Brad; Ramos, Alex H.; Robinson, James; Roth, Jack A.; Rusch, Valerie; Sasaki, Hidefumi; Shepherd, Frances; Sougnez, Carrie; Spitz, Margaret R.; Tsao, Ming-Sound; Twomey, David; Verhaak, Roel G.

3,121,153.0,"Understanding the dynamics of correlated many-body quantum systems is a challenge for modern physics. Owing to the simplicity of theirHamiltonians, He-4 (bosons) and He-3 (fermions) have served as model systems for strongly interacting quantum fluids, with substantial efforts devoted to their understanding. An important milestone was the direct observation of the collective phonon-roton mode in liquid He-4 by neutron scattering, verifying Landau's prediction(1) and his fruitful concept of elementary excitations. In a Fermi system, collective density fluctuations (known as 'zero-sound' in He-3, and 'plasmons' in charged systems) and incoherent particle-hole excitations are observed. At small wavevectors and energies, both types of excitation are described by Landau's theory of Fermi liquids(2,3). At higher wavevectors, the collectivemode enters the particle-hole band, where it is strongly damped. The dynamics of Fermi liquids at high wavevectors was thus believed to be essentially incoherent. Here we report inelastic neutron scattering measurements of a monolayer of liquid He-3, observing a roton-like excitation. We find that the collective density mode reappears as a well defined excitation atmomentum transfers larger than twice the Fermi momentum. We thus observe unexpected collective behaviour of a Fermi many-body system in the regime beyond the scope of Landau's theory. A satisfactory interpretation of the measured spectra is obtained using a dynamic many-body theory(4).","Godfrin, Henri; Meschke, Matthias; Lauter, Hans-Jochen; Sultan, Ahmad; Boehm, Helga M.; Krotscheck, Eckhard; Panholzer, Martin","Godfrin, H; Meschke, M; Lauter, HJ; Sultan, A; Bohm, HM; Krotscheck, E; Panholzer, M",576.0,"[Godfrin, Henri; Meschke, Matthias; Sultan, Ahmad] CNRS, Inst Neel, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France; [Godfrin, Henri; Meschke, Matthias; Sultan, Ahmad] Univ Grenoble 1, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France; [Meschke, Matthias] Aalto Univ, Low Temp Lab, Aalto 00076, Finland; [Lauter, Hans-Jochen] Inst Laue Langevin, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France; [Lauter, Hans-Jochen] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Boehm, Helga M.; Krotscheck, Eckhard; Panholzer, Martin] Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Inst Theoret Phys, A-4040 Linz, Austria; [Krotscheck, Eckhard] SUNY Buffalo, Dept Phys, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10919,Article,,henri.godfrin@grenoble.cnrs.fr,579,Austrian Fonds zur Forderung der wissenschaftlichen Forschung (FWF) [P21264]; French Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-2010-INTB-403-01]; EU [228464],"We are grateful to the Austrian-French programme Amadeus for providing initial support; to the Austrian Fonds zur Forderung der wissenschaftlichen Forschung (FWF grant P21264), the French Agence Nationale de la Recherche (project ANR-2010-INTB-403-01) and the EU FRP7 low-temperature infrastructure grant Microkelvin (project number 228464) for funding this research; and to the Institut Laue-Langevin for use of the facility.",915EF,,,ELEMENTARY EXCITATIONS; EFFECTIVE-MASS; NEUTRON-SCATTERING; SPIN FLUCTUATIONS; ZERO SOUND; HE-3; FILMS; PLASMONS; GRAPHITE; DYNAMICS,7391.0,NATURE,Nature,English,31.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",29-Mar,4.0,LONDON,22460903.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2012.0,"Meschke, Matthias/G-5166-2012","Godfrin, H (reprint author), CNRS, Inst Neel, BP 166, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,17.0,Observation of a roton collective mode in a two-dimensional Fermi liquid,5.0,40.0,WOS:000302006100034,153.0,483,Multidisciplinary Sciences,17,martin,panholzer,118.0,3568,male,1.0,oDRnEUgAAAAJ,1,"[0, 1474]",143848,1,143848,1,List of suicides,List of suicides,0,0
4,120,131.0,"In most eukaryotes, the progressive loss of chromosome-terminal DNA sequences is counteracted by the enzyme telomerase, a reverse transcriptase that uses part of an RNA subunit as template to synthesize telomeric repeats. Many cancer cells express high telomerase activity, and mutations in telomerase subunits are associated with degenerative syndromes including dyskeratosis congenita and aplastic anaemia. The therapeutic value of altering telomerase activity thus provides ample impetus to study the biogenesis and regulation of this enzyme in human cells and model systems. We have previously identified a precursor of the fission yeast telomerase RNA subunit (TER1)(1) and demonstrated that the mature 3'-end is generated by the spliceosome in a single cleavage reaction akin to the first step of splicing(2). Directly upstream and partly overlapping with the spliceosomal cleavage site is a putative binding site for Sm proteins. Sm and like-Sm (LSm) proteins belong to an ancient family of RNA-binding proteins represented in all three domains of life(3). Members of this family form ring complexes on specific sets of target RNAs and have critical roles in their biogenesis, function and turnover. Here we demonstrate that the canonical Sm ring and the Lsm2-8 complex sequentially associate with fission yeast TER1. The Sm ring binds to the TER1 precursor, stimulates spliceosomal cleavage and promotes the hypermethylation of the 5'-cap by Tgs1. Sm proteins are then replaced by the Lsm2-8 complex, which promotes the association with the catalytic subunit and protects the mature 3'-end of TER1 from exonucleolytic degradation. Our findings define the sequence of events that occur during telomerase biogenesis and characterize roles for Sm and Lsm complexes as well as for the methylase Tgs1.","Tang, Wen; Kannan, Ram; Blanchette, Marco; Baumann, Peter","Tang, W; Kannan, R; Blanchette, M; Baumann, P",260.0,"[Tang, Wen; Kannan, Ram; Baumann, Peter] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; [Tang, Wen; Kannan, Ram; Blanchette, Marco; Baumann, Peter] Stowers Inst Med Res, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; [Tang, Wen; Kannan, Ram; Baumann, Peter] Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Dept Mol & Integrat Physiol, Kansas City, KS 66160 USA; [Blanchette, Marco] Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Kansas City, KS 66160 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10924,Article,,peb@stowers.org,U152,Stowers Institute for Medical Research; American Heart Association,"We thank S.

5,78,157.0,"During glacial periods of the Late Pleistocene, an abundance of proxy data demonstrates the existence of large and repeated millennial-scale warming episodes, known as Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events(1). This ubiquitous feature of rapid glacial climate change can be extended back as far as 800,000 years before present (BP) in the ice core record(2), and has drawn broad attention within the science and policy-making communities alike(3). Many studies have been dedicated to investigating the underlying causes of these changes, but no coherent mechanism has yet been identified(3-15). Here we show, by using a comprehensive fully coupled model(16), that gradual changes in the height of the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets (NHISs) canalter the coupled atmosphere ocean system and cause rapid glacial climate shifts closely resembling DO events. The simulated global climate responses-including abrupt warming in the North Atlantic, a northward shift of the tropical rain-belts, and Southern Hemisphere cooling related to the bipolar seesa ware generally consistent with empirical evidence(1,3,17). As a result of the coexistence of two glacial ocean circulation states at intermediate heights of the ice sheets, minor changes in the height of the NHISs and the amount of atmospheric CO2 can trigger the rapid climate transitions via a local positive atmosphere-ocean-sea-ice feedback in the North Atlantic. Our results, although based on a single model, thus provide a coherent concept for understanding the recorded millennial scale variability and abrupt climate changes in the coupled atmosphere ocean system, as well as their linkages to the volume of the intermediate ice sheets during glacials.","Zhang, Xu; Lohmann, Gerrit; Knorr, Gregor; Purcell, Conor","Zhang, X; Lohmann, G; Knorr, G; Purcell, C",290.0,"[Zhang, Xu; Lohmann, Gerrit; Knorr, Gregor; Purcell, Conor] Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Alfred Wegener Inst, D-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany; [Lohmann, Gerrit] Univ Bremen, MARUM Ctr Marine Environm Sci, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Knorr, Gregor; Purcell, Conor] Cardiff Univ, Sch Earth & Ocean Sci, Cardiff CF10 3AT, S Glam, Wales",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13592,Article,1476-4687,xu.zhang@awi.de,+,"Polar Regions and Coasts in the Changing Earth System (PACES) programme of the AWI; 'Helmholtz Climate Initiative REKLIM' (Regional Climate Change), a joint research project of the Helmholtz Association of German research centres (HGF)","We thank the colleagues in the Paleoclimate Dynamics group at the Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI) in Bremerhaven for useful discussions, and I.

6,22,199.0,"The largest extant snakes live in the tropics of South America and southeast Asia(1-3) where high temperatures facilitate the evolution of large body sizes among air- breathing animals whose body temperatures are dependant on ambient environmental temperatures ( poikilothermy)(4,5). Very little is known about ancient tropical terrestrial ecosystems, limiting our understanding of the evolution of giant snakes and their relationship to climate in the past. Here we describe a boid snake from the oldest known neotropical rainforest fauna from the Cerrejon Formation ( 58 - 60 Myr ago) in northeastern Colombia. We estimate a body length of 13 and a mass of 1,135 kg, making it the largest known snake(6-9). The maximum size of poikilothermic animals at a given temperature is limited by metabolic rate(4), and a snake of this size would require a minimum mean annual temperature of 30 - 34 degrees C to survive. This estimate is consistent with hypotheses of hot Palaeocene neotropics with high concentrations of atmospheric CO(2) based on climate models(10). Comparison of palaeotemperature estimates from the equator to those from South American mid- latitudes indicates a relatively steep temperature gradient during the early Palaeogene greenhouse, similar to that of today. Depositional environments and faunal composition of the Cerrejon Formation indicate an anaconda- like ecology for the giant snake, and an earliest Cenozoic origin of neotropical vertebrate faunas.","Head, Jason J.; Bloch, Jonathan I.; Hastings, Alexander K.; Bourque, Jason R.; Cadena, Edwin A.; Herrera, Fabiany A.; Polly, P.

7,33,474.0,"The oral cavity of vertebrates is generally thought to arise as an ectodermal invagination(1,2). Consistent with this, oral teeth are proposed to arise exclusively from ectoderm, contributing to tooth enamel epithelium, and from neural crest derived mesenchyme, contributing to dentin and pulp(3-5). Yet in many vertebrate groups, teeth are not restricted only to the oral cavity(6-9), but extend posteriorly as pharyngeal teeth that could be derived either directly from the endodermal epithelium, or from the ectodermal epithelium that reached this location through the mouth or through the pharyngeal slits(6). However, when the oropharyngeal membrane, which forms a sharp ecto/ endodermal border(10), is broken, the fate of these cells is poorly known. Here, using transgenic axolotls with a combination of fate- mapping approaches, we present reliable evidence of oral teeth derived from both the ectoderm and endoderm and, moreover, demonstrate teeth with a mixed ecto/ endodermal origin. Despite the enamel epithelia having a different embryonic source, oral teeth in the axolotl display striking developmental uniformities and are otherwise identical. This suggests a dominant role for the neural crest mesenchyme over epithelia in tooth initiation and, from an evolutionary point of view, that an essential factor in teeth evolution was the odontogenic capacity of neural crest cells, regardless of possible 'outside-in'(11) or 'inside-out'(12) influx of the epithelium.","Soukup, Vladimir; Epperlein, Hans-Henning; Horacek, Ivan; Cerny, Robert","Soukup, V; Epperlein, HH; Horacek, I; Cerny, R",795.0,"[Soukup, Vladimir; Horacek, Ivan; Cerny, Robert] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Zool, CR-12844 Prague, Czech Republic; [Epperlein, Hans-Henning] Tech Univ Dresden, Dept Anat, D-01307 Dresden, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07304,Article,,cerny8@natur.cuni.cz,U6,"Ministry of Youth, Education and Sport of the Czech Republic [MSMT 0021620828]; SMWK (Dresden); COST Action B23","We wish to thank E.

8,79,242.0,"Genome instability is central to ageing, cancer and other diseases. It is not only proteins involved in DNA replication or the DNA damage response (DDR) that are important for maintaining genome integrity: from yeast to higher eukaryotes, mutations in genes involved in pre-mRNA splicing and in the biogenesis and export of messenger ribonudeoprotein (mRNP) also induce DNA damage and genome instability. This instability is frequently mediated by R-loops formed by DNA-RNA hybrids and a displaced single-stranded DNA(1). Here we show that the human TREX-2 complex, which is involved in mRNP biogenesis and export, prevents genome instability as determined by the accumulation of gamma-H2AX (Ser-139 phosphorylated histone H2AX) and 53BP1 foci and single-cell electrophoresis in cells depleted of the TREX-2 subunits PCID2, GANP and DSSI. We show that the BRCA2 repair factor, which binds to DSS1, also associates with PCID2 in the cell. The use of an enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged hybrid-binding domain of RNase HI and the S9.6 antibody did not detect R-loops in TREX-2-depleted cells, but did detect the accumulation of R-loops in BRCA2-depleted cells. The results indicate that R-loops are frequently formed in cells and that BRCA2 is required for their processing. This link between BRCA2 and RNA-mediated genome instability indicates that R-loops may be a chief source of replication stress and cancer-associated instability.","Bhatia, Vaibhav; Barroso, Sonia I.; Garcia-Rubio, Maria L.; Tumini, Emanuela; Herrera-Moyano, Emilia; Aguilera, Andres","Bhatia, V; Barroso, SI; Garcia-Rubio, ML; Tumini, E; Herrera-Moyano, E; Aguilera, A",362.0,"[Bhatia, Vaibhav; Barroso, Sonia I.; Garcia-Rubio, Maria L.; Tumini, Emanuela; Herrera-Moyano, Emilia; Aguilera, Andres] Univ Seville, Ctr Andaluz Biol Mol & Med Regenerat CABIMER, Seville 41092, Spain",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13374,Article,1476-4687,aguilo@us.es,+,"Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [C5D2007-00015, BFU2010-16372]; Junta de Andalucia [CVI4567]; European Union (FEDER)","We thank J.C.

9,7,100.0,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) mediate post-transcriptional gene regulation through association with Argonaute proteins (AGOs)(1). Crystal structures of archaeal and bacterial homologues of AGOs have shown that the MID(middle) domain mediates the interaction with the phosphorylated 5' end of the miRNA guide strand and this interaction is thought to be independent of the identity of the 5' nucleotide in these systems(2,3). However, analysis of the known sequences of eukaryotic miRNAs and co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that there is a clear bias for U or A at the 5' position(4-7). Here we report the crystal structure of a MID domain from a eukaryotic AGO protein, human AGO2. The structure, in complex with nucleoside monophosphates (AMP, CMP, GMP, and UMP) mimicking the 5' end of miRNAs, shows that there are specific contacts made between the base of UMP or AMP and a rigid loop in the MID domain. Notably, the structure of the loop discriminates against CMP and GMP and dissociation constants calculated from NMR titration experiments confirm these results, showing that AMP (0.26 mM) and UMP (0.12 mM) bind with up to 30-fold higher affinity than either CMP (3.6 mM) or GMP (3.3 mM). This study provides structural evidence for nucleotide-specific interactions in the MID domain of eukaryotic AGO proteins and explains the observed preference for U or A at the 5' end of miRNAs.","Frank, Filipp; Sonenberg, Nahum; Nagar, Bhushan","Frank, F; Sonenberg, N; Nagar, B",818.0,"[Frank, Filipp; Sonenberg, Nahum; Nagar, Bhushan] McGill Univ, Dept Biochem, Montreal, PQ H3G 0B1, Canada; [Frank, Filipp; Sonenberg, Nahum] McGill Univ, Goodman Canc Ctr, Montreal, PQ H3G 0B1, Canada; [Frank, Filipp; Nagar, Bhushan] Grp Rech Axe Struct Prot, Montreal, PQ H3G 0B1, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09039,Article,,bhushan.nagar@mcgill.ca,822,Canada Research Chair; Human Frontiers Science Program [CDA 0018/2006-C/1]; Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) [MOP-82929]; Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds,"We thank O.

This malignancy represents a heterogeneous group of tumours with characteristic molecular features, prognosis and responses to available therapy(2-4). Recurrent somatic alterations in breast cancer have been described, including mutations and copy number alterations, notably ERBB2 amplifications, the first successful therapy target defined by a genomic aberration(5). Previous DNA sequencing studies of breast cancer genomes have revealed additional candidate mutations and gene rearrangements(6-10). Here we report the whole-exome sequences of DNA from 103 human breast cancers of diverse subtypes from patients in Mexico and Vietnam compared to matched-normal DNA, together with whole-genome sequences of 22 breast cancer/normal pairs. Beyond confirming recurrent somatic mutations in PIK3CA(11), TP53(6), AKT1(12), GATA3(13) and MAP3K1(10), we discovered recurrent mutations in the CBFB transcription factor gene and deletions of its partner RUNX1. Furthermore, we have identified a recurrent MAGI3-AKT3 fusion enriched in triple-negative breast cancer lacking oestrogen and progesterone receptors and ERBB2 expression. The MAGI3-AKT3 fusion leads to constitutive activation of AKT kinase, which is abolished by treatment with an ATP-competitive AKT small-molecule inhibitor.","Banerji, Shantanu; Cibulskis, Kristian; Rangel-Escareno, Claudia; Brown, Kristin K.; Carter, Scott L.; Frederick, Abbie M.; Lawrence, Michael S.; Sivachenko, Andrey Y.; Sougnez, Carrie; Zou, Lihua; Cortes, Maria L.; Fernandez-Lopez, Juan C.; Peng, Shouyong; Ardlie, Kristin G.; Auclair, Daniel; Bautista-Pina, Veronica; Duke, Fujiko; Francis, Joshua; Jung, Joonil; Maffuz-Aziz, Antonio; Onofrio, Robert C.; Parkin, Melissa; Pho, Nam H.; Quintanar-Jurado, Valeria; Ramos, Alex H.; Rebollar-Vega, Rosa; Rodriguez-Cuevas, Sergio; Romero-Cordoba, Sandra L.; Schumacher, Steven E.; Stransky, Nicolas; Thompson, Kristin M.; Uribe-Figueroa, Laura; Baselga, Jose; Beroukhim, Rameen; Polyak, Kornelia; Sgroi, Dennis C.; Richardson, Andrea L.; Jimenez-Sanchez, Gerardo; Lander, Eric S.; Gabriel, Stacey B.; Garraway, Levi A.; Golub, Todd R.; Melendez-Zajgla, Jorge; Toker, Alex; Getz, Gad; Hidalgo-Miranda, Alfredo; Meyerson, Matthew","Banerji, S; Cibulskis, K; Rangel-Escareno, C; Brown, KK; Carter, SL; Frederick, AM; Lawrence, MS; Sivachenko, AY; Sougnez, C; Zou, LH; Cortes, ML; Fernandez-Lopez, JC; Peng, SY; Ardlie, KG; Auclair, D; Bautista-Pina, V; Duke, F; Francis, J; Jung, J; Maffuz-Aziz, A; Onofrio, RC; Parkin, M; Pho, NH; Quintanar-Jurado, V; Ramos, AH; Rebollar-Vega, R; Rodriguez-Cuevas, S; Romero-Cordoba, SL; Schumacher, SE; Stransky, N; Thompson, KM; Uribe-Figueroa, L; Baselga, J; Beroukhim, R; Polyak, K; Sgroi, DC; Richardson, AL; Jimenez-Sanchez, G; Lander, ES; Gabriel, SB; Garraway, LA; Golub, TR; Melendez-Zajgla, J; Toker, A; Getz, G; Hidalgo-Miranda, A; Meyerson, M",405.0,"[Banerji, Shantanu; Cibulskis, Kristian; Carter, Scott L.; Frederick, Abbie M.; Lawrence, Michael S.; Sivachenko, Andrey Y.; Sougnez, Carrie; Zou, Lihua; Cortes, Maria L.; Ardlie, Kristin G.; Auclair, Daniel; Duke, Fujiko; Francis, Joshua; Jung, Joonil; Onofrio, Robert C.; Parkin, Melissa; Pho, Nam H.; Ramos, Alex H.; Schumacher, Steven E.; Stransky, Nicolas; Thompson, Kristin M.; Beroukhim, Rameen; Lander, Eric S.; Gabriel, Stacey B.; Garraway, Levi A.; Golub, Todd R.; Getz, Gad; Meyerson, Matthew] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Banerji, Shantanu; Peng, Shouyong; Schumacher, Steven E.; Beroukhim, Rameen; Polyak, Kornelia; Richardson, Andrea L.; Garraway, Levi A.; Meyerson, Matthew] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Banerji, Shantanu; Baselga, Jose; Beroukhim, Rameen; Polyak, Kornelia; Sgroi, Dennis C.; Richardson, Andrea L.; Lander, Eric S.; Garraway, Levi A.; Golub, Todd R.; Toker, Alex; Meyerson, Matthew] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Rangel-Escareno, Claudia; Fernandez-Lopez, Juan C.; Quintanar-Jurado, Valeria; Rebollar-Vega, Rosa; Romero-Cordoba, Sandra L.; Uribe-Figueroa, Laura; Jimenez-Sanchez, Gerardo; Melendez-Zajgla, Jorge; Hidalgo-Miranda, Alfredo] Inst Nacl Med Genom, Mexico City 01900, DF, Mexico; [Brown, Kristin K.; Toker, Alex] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Bautista-Pina, Veronica; Maffuz-Aziz, Antonio; Rodriguez-Cuevas, Sergio] FUCAM, Inst Enfermedades Mama, Mexico City 04980, DF, Mexico; [Baselga, Jose] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Div Hematol & Oncol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Beroukhim, Rameen; Meyerson, Matthew] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Biol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Polyak, Kornelia] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Sgroi, Dennis C.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Richardson, Andrea L.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Lander, Eric S.] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Golub, Todd R.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Pediat Oncol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Golub, Todd R.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chevy Chase, MD 20815 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11154,Article,1476-4687,atoker@bidmc.harvard.edu; gadgetz@broadinstitute.org; ahidalgo@inmegen.gob.mx; matthew_meyerson@dfci.harvard.edu,409,Carlos Slim Health Institute in Mexico; CancerCare Manitoba; University of Manitoba; John Gavin Post-doctoral Fellowship; Genesis Oncology Trust of New Zealand; Mexican Council of Science and Technology (CONACyT); NIH [CA122099]; Dana-Farber/Harvard SPORE in breast cancer under NCI grant [CA089393],"We would like to thank all patients who contributed samples to this study.

11,114,346.0,"Silicon transistors are expected to have new gate architectures, channel materials and switching mechanisms in ten years' time(1-4). The trend in transistor scaling has already led to a change in gate structure from two dimensions to three, used in fin field-effect transistors, to avoid problems inherent in miniaturization such as high off-state leakage current and the short-channel effect. At present, planar and fin architectures using III-V materials, specifically InGaAs, are being explored as alternative fast channels on silicon(5-9) because of their high electron mobility and high-quality interface with gate dielectrics(10). The idea of surrounding-gate transistors(11), in which the gate is wrapped around a nanowire channel to provide the best possible electrostatic gate control, using InGaAs channels on silicon, however, has been less well investigated(12,13) because of difficulties in integrating free-standing InGaAs nanostructures on silicon. Here we report the position-controlled growth of vertical InGaAs nanowires on silicon without any buffering technique and demonstrate surrounding-gate transistors using InGaAs nanowires and InGaAs/InP/InAlAs/InGaAs core-multishell nanowires as channels. Surrounding-gate transistors using core-multishell nanowire channels with a six-sided, high-electron-mobility transistor structure greatly enhance the on-state current and transconductance while keeping good gate controllability. These devices provide a route to making vertically oriented transistors for the next generation of field-effect transistors and may be useful as building blocks for wireless networks on silicon platforms.","Tomioka, Katsuhiro; Yoshimura, Masatoshi; Fukui, Takashi","Tomioka, K; Yoshimura, M; Fukui, T",189.0,"[Tomioka, Katsuhiro; Yoshimura, Masatoshi; Fukui, Takashi] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608628, Japan; [Tomioka, Katsuhiro; Yoshimura, Masatoshi; Fukui, Takashi] Hokkaido Univ, RCIQE, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608628, Japan; [Tomioka, Katsuhiro] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy PRESTO, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11293,Article,,tomioka@rciqe.hokudai.ac.jp,+,MEXT; Japan Science and Technology Agency - PRESTO programme,"We thank J.

12,14,318.0,"Integrase is an essential retroviral enzyme that binds both termini of linear viral DNA and inserts them into a host cell chromosome. The structure of full-length retroviral integrase, either separately or in complex with DNA, has been lacking. Furthermore, although clinically useful inhibitors of HIV integrase have been developed, their mechanism of action remains speculative. Here we present a crystal structure of full-length integrase from the prototype foamy virus in complex with its cognate DNA. The structure shows the organization of the retroviral intasome comprising an integrase tetramer tightly associated with a pair of viral DNA ends. All three canonical integrase structural domains are involved in extensive protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions. The binding of strand-transfer inhibitors displaces the reactive viral DNA end from the active site, disarming the viral nucleoprotein complex. Our findings define the structural basis of retroviral DNA integration, and will allow modelling of the HIV-1 intasome to aid in the development of antiretroviral drugs.","Hare, Stephen; Gupta, Saumya Shree; Valkov, Eugene; Engelman, Alan; Cherepanov, Peter","Hare, S; Gupta, SS; Valkov, E; Engelman, A; Cherepanov, P",232.0,"[Hare, Stephen; Gupta, Saumya Shree; Valkov, Eugene; Cherepanov, Peter] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Div Med, London W2 1PG, England; [Engelman, Alan] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Immunol & AIDS, Boston, MA 02115 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08784,Article,,p.cherepanov@imperial.ac.uk,U108,UK Medical Research Council; US National Institutes of Health,"We thank F.

13,18,77.0,"Geological mapping and geochronological studies have shown much lower eruption rates for ocean island basalts (OIBs) in comparison with those of lavas from large igneous provinces (LIPs) such as oceanic plateaux and continental flood provinces(1). However, a quantitative petrological comparison has never been made between mantle source temperature and the extent of melting for OIB and LIP sources. Here we show that the MgO and FeO contents of Galapagos related lavas and their primary magmas have decreased since the Cretaceous period. From petrological modelling(2), we infer that these changes reflect a cooling of the Galapagos mantle plume from a potential temperature of 1,560-1,620 degrees C in the Cretaceous to 1,500 degrees C at present. Iceland also exhibits secular cooling, in agreement with previous studies(3,4). Our work provides quantitative petrological evidence that, in general, mantle plumes for LIPs with Palaeocene-Permian ages were hotter and melted more extensively than plumes of more modern ocean islands. We interpret this to reflect episodic flow from lower-mantle domains that are lithologically and geochemically heterogeneous.","Herzberg, Claude; Gazel, Esteban","Herzberg, C; Gazel, E",619.0,"[Herzberg, Claude; Gazel, Esteban] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07857,Article,,herzberg@rci.rutgers.edu,U83,,,427RK,,,ATLANTIC IGNEOUS PROVINCE; FLOOD BASALTS; TECTONIC EVOLUTION; THERMAL STRUCTURE; OCEANIC PLATEAUS; MELT GENERATION; LITHOSPHERE; CONSTRAINTS; GREENLAND; VOLCANISM,7238.0,NATURE,Nature,English,35.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2-Apr,5.0,LONDON,19340079.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2009.0,"Gazel, Esteban/B-8090-2012","Herzberg, C (reprint author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, 610 Taylor Rd, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,106.0,Petrological evidence for secular cooling in mantle plumes,3.0,46.0,WOS:000264796200038,77.0,458,Multidisciplinary Sciences,106,esteban,gazel,807.0,495,male,1.0,RwEXWNoAAAAJ,1,"[0, 1474]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
14,13,299.0,"The most distant quasars known, at redshifts z approximate to 6, generally have properties indistinguishable from those of lower-redshift quasars in the rest-frame ultraviolet/optical and X-ray bands(1-3). This puzzling result suggests that these distant quasars are evolved objects even though the Universe was only seven per cent of its current age at these redshifts. Recently one z approximate to 6 quasar was shown not to have any detectable emission from hot dust(4), but it was unclear whether that indicated different hot-dust properties at high redshift or if it is simply an outlier. Here we report the discovery of a second quasar without hot-dust emission in a sample of 21 z approximate to 6 quasars. Such apparently hot-dust-free quasars have no counterparts at low redshift. Moreover, we demonstrate that the hot-dust abundance in the 21 quasars builds up in tandem with the growth of the central black hole, whereas at low redshift it is almost independent of the black hole mass. Thus z approximate to 6 quasars are indeed at an early evolutionary stage, with rapid mass accretion and dust formation. The two hot-dust-free quasars are likely to be first-generation quasars born in dust-free environments and are too young to have formed a detectable amount of hot dust around them.","Jiang, Linhua; Fan, Xiaohui; Brandt, W.

15,62,315.0,"Nearly three-quarters of the growth in global carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels and cement production between 2010 and 2012 occurred in China(1,2). Yet estimates of Chinese emissions remain subject to large uncertainty; inventories of China's total fossil fuel carbon emissions in 2008 differ by 0.3 gigatonnes of carbon, or 15 per cent(1,3-5). The primary sources of this uncertainty are conflicting estimates of energy consumption and emission factors, the latter being uncertain because of very few actual measurements representative of the mix of Chinese fuels. Here we re-evaluate China's carbon emissions using updated and harmonized energy consumption and clinker production data and two new and comprehensive sets of measured emission factors for Chinese coal. We find that total energy consumption in China was 10 per cent higher in 2000-2012 than the value reported by China's national statistics(6), that emission factors for Chinese coal are on average 40 per cent lower than the default values recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(7), and that emissions from China's cement production are 45 per cent less than recent estimates(1,4). Altogether, our revised estimate of China's CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement production is 2.49 gigatonnes of carbon (2 standard deviations = +/-7.3 per cent) in 2013, which is 14 per cent lower than the emissions reported by other prominent inventories(1,4,8). Over the full period 2000 to 2013, our revised estimates are 2.9 gigatonnes of carbon less than previous estimates of China's cumulative carbon emissions(1,4). Our findings suggest that overestimation of China's emissions in 2000-2013 may be larger than China's estimated total forest sink in 1990-2007 (2.66 gigatonnes of carbon)(9) or China's land carbon sink in 2000-2009 (2.6 gigatonnes of carbon)(10).","Liu, Zhu;

Here we use solution-state NMR to examine the process of mu OR activation using a purified receptor (mouse sequence) preparation in an amphiphile membrane-like environment. We obtain spectra of the mu OR in the absence of ligand, and in the presence of the high-affinity agonist BU72 alone, or with BU72 and a G protein mimetic nanobody. Our results show that conformational changes in transmembrane segments 5 and 6 (TM5 and TM6), which are required for the full engagement of a G protein, are almost completely dependent on the presence of both the agonist and the G protein mimetic nanobody, revealing a weak allosteric coupling between the agonist-binding pocket and the G-protein-coupling interface (TM5 and TM6), similar to that observed for the beta 2-adrenergic receptor(3). Unexpectedly, in the presence of agonist alone, we find larger spectral changes involving intracellular loop 1 and helix 8 compared to changes in TM5 and TM6. These results suggest that one or both of these domains may play a role in the initial interaction with the G protein, and that TM5 and TM6 are only engaged later in the process of complex formation. The initial interactions between the G protein and intracellular loop 1 and/or helix 8 may be involved in G-protein coupling specificity, as has been suggested for other family A G-protein-coupled receptors.","Sounier, Remy; Mas, Camille; Steyaert, Jan; Laeremans, Toon; Manglik, Aashish; Huang, Weijiao; Kobilka, Brian K.; Demene, Helene; Granier, Sebastien","Sounier, R; Mas, C; Steyaert, J; Laeremans, T; Manglik, A; Huang, WJ; Kobilka, BK; Demene, H; Granier, S",375.0,"[Sounier, Remy; Mas, Camille; Granier, Sebastien] Univ Montpellier, Inst Genom Fonct, CNRS, INSERM,U1191,UMR 5203, F-34000 Montpellier, France; [Steyaert, Jan; Laeremans, Toon] Vrije Univ Brussel, Struct Biol Brussels, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Steyaert, Jan; Laeremans, Toon] VIB, Struct Biol Res Ctr, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Manglik, Aashish; Huang, Weijiao; Kobilka, Brian K.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Physiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Demene, Helene] Univ Montpellier, Ctr Biochim Struct, CNRS, INSERM 1054,UMR 5048, F-34090 Montpellier, France",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14680,Article,1476-4687,helene@cbs.cnrs.fr; sebastien.granier@igf.cnrs.fr,+,INSERM; CNRS; National Institutes of Health [NIDA-DA036246],We acknowledge support from INSERM (S.G.) and CNRS (H.D.) and from the National Institutes of Health Grant (NIDA-DA036246 to B.K.K. and S.G.).

17,93,49.0,"The Josephson effect describes the flow of supercurrent in a weak link-such as a tunnel junction, nanowire or molecule-between two superconductors(1). It is the basis for a variety of circuits and devices, with applications ranging from medicine(2) to quantum information(3). Experiments using Josephson circuits that behave like artificial atoms(4) are now revolutionizing the way we probe and exploit the laws of quantum physics(5,6). Microscopically, the supercurrent is carried by Andreev pair states, which are localized at the weak link. These states come in doublets and have energies inside the superconducting gap(7-10). Existing Josephson circuits are based on properties of just the ground state of each doublet, and so far the excited states have not been directly detected. Here we establish their existence through spectroscopic measurements of superconducting atomic contacts. The spectra, which depend on the atomic configuration and on the phase difference between the superconductors, are in complete agreement with theory. Andreev doublets could be exploited to encode information in novel types of superconducting qubits(11-13).","Bretheau, L.; Girit, C.

18,83,335.0,"PINK1 (PTEN induced putative kinase 1) and PARKIN (also known as PARK2) have been identified as the causal genes responsible for hereditary recessive early-onset Parkinsonism(1,2). PINK1 is a Ser/Thr kinase that specifically accumulates on depolarized mitochondria, whereas parkin is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that catalyses ubiquitin transfer to mitochondrial substrates(3-5). PINK1 acts as an upstream factor for parkin(6,7) and is essential both for the activation of latent E3 parkin activity(8) and for recruiting parkin onto depolarized mitochondria(8-12). Recently, mechanistic insights into mitochondrial quality control mediated by PINK1 and parkin have been revealed(3-5), and PINK1-dependent phosphorylation of parkin has been reported(13-15). However, the requirement of PINK1 for parkin activation was not bypassed by phosphomimetic parkin mutation(15), and how PINK1 accelerates the E3 activity of parkin on damaged mitochondria is still obscure. Here we report that ubiquitin is the genuine substrate of PINK1. PINK1 phosphorylated ubiquitin at Ser 65 both in vitro and in cells, and a Ser 65 phosphopeptide derived from endogenous ubiquitin was only detected in cells in the presence of PINK1 and following a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential. Unexpectedly, phosphomimetic ubiquitin bypassed PINK1-dependent activation of a phosphomimetic parkin mutant in cells. Furthermore, phosphomimetic ubiquitin accelerates discharge of the thioester conjugate formed by UBCH7 (also known as UBE2L3) and ubiquitin (UBCH7 ubiquitin) in the presence of parkin in vitro, indicating that it acts allosterically. The phosphorylation-dependent interaction between ubiquitin and parkin suggests that phosphorylated ubiquitin unlocks autoinhibition of the catalytic cysteine. Our results show that PINK1-dependent phosphorylation of both parkin and ubiquitin is sufficient for full activation of parkin E3 activity. These findings demonstrate that phosphorylated ubiquitin is a parkin activator.","Koyano, Fumika; Okatsu, Kei; Kosako, Hidetaka; Tamura, Yasushi; Go, Etsu; Kimura, Mayumi; Kimura, Yoko; Tsuchiya, Hikaru; Yoshihara, Hidehito; Hirokawa, Takatsugu; Endo, Toshiya; Fon, Edward A.; Trempe, Jean-Francois; Saeki, Yasushi; Tanaka, Keiji; Matsuda, Noriyuki","Koyano, F; Okatsu, K; Kosako, H; Tamura, Y; Go, E; Kimura, M; Kimura, Y; Tsuchiya, H; Yoshihara, H; Hirokawa, T; Endo, T; Fon, EA; Trempe, JF; Saeki, Y; Tanaka, K; Matsuda, N",162.0,"[Koyano, Fumika; Okatsu, Kei; Go, Etsu; Kimura, Mayumi; Kimura, Yoko; Tsuchiya, Hikaru; Yoshihara, Hidehito; Saeki, Yasushi; Tanaka, Keiji; Matsuda, Noriyuki] Tokyo Metropolitan Inst Med Sci, Lab Prot Metab, Setagaya Ku, Tokyo 1568506, Japan; [Koyano, Fumika; Okatsu, Kei] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778561, Japan; [Kosako, Hidetaka] Univ Tokushima, Div Cell Signaling, Fujii Mem Inst Med Sci, Tokushima 7708503, Japan; [Tamura, Yasushi] Nagoya Univ, Res Ctr Mat Sci, Nagoya, Aichi 4648602, Japan; [Kimura, Yoko] Shizuoka Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Shizuoka 4228529, Japan; [Hirokawa, Takatsugu] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Mol Profiling Res Ctr Drug Discovery, Koto Ku, Tokyo 1350064, Japan; [Endo, Toshiya] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Sci, JST CREST Dept Chem, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648602, Japan; [Endo, Toshiya] Kyoto Sangyo Univ, JST CREST Fac Life Sci, Kita Ku, Kyoto 6038555, Japan; [Fon, Edward A.] McGill Univ, McGill Parkinson Program, Dept Neurol & Neurosurg, Montreal Neurol Inst & Hosp, Montreal, PQ H3A 2B4, Canada; [Trempe, Jean-Francois] McGill Univ, Dept Pharmacol & Therapeut, Montreal, PQ H3G 1Y6, Canada; [Matsuda, Noriyuki] Tokyo Metropolitan Inst Med Sci, Prot Metab Project, Setagaya Ku, Tokyo 1568506, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13392,Article,1476-4687,tanaka-kj@igakuken.or.jp; matsuda-nr@igakuken.or.jp,+,"JSPS KAKENHI [23687018, 23-6061, 21000012, 24657072, 22227003]; MEXT KAKENHI [24111557, 25112522, 24112008]; Tomizawa Jun-ichi and Keiko Fund; JST CREST; Platform for Drug Discovery, Informatics, and Structural Life Science from MEXT; McGill University; GRASP from the FRSQ; CIHR; FRSQ; Takeda Science Foundation","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI grant numbers 23687018 (to N.M.), 23-6061 (to K.O.), 21000012 (to K.

Zonal flow formation in nuclear fusion devices is also well studied(2). A common feature of these zonal flows is that they are spontaneously generated in turbulent systems. Because the Earth's outer core is believed to be in a turbulent state, it is possible that there is zonal flow in the liquid iron of the outer core. Here we report an investigation at the current low-viscosity limit of numerical simulations of the geodynamo. We find a previously unknown convection regime of the outer core that has a dual structure comprising inner, sheet-like radial plumes and an outer, westward cylindrical zonal flow. We numerically confirm that the dual-convection structure with such a zonal flow is stable under a strong, self-generated dipole magnetic field.","Miyagoshi, Takehiro; Kageyama, Akira; Sato, Tetsuya","Miyagoshi, T; Kageyama, A; Sato, T",793.0,"[Kageyama, Akira] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan; [Miyagoshi, Takehiro] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan; [Sato, Tetsuya] Univ Hyogo, Kobe, Hyogo 6500044, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08754,Article,,kage@cs.kobe-u.ac.jp,U102,KAKENHI [17540404]; Mitsubishi Foundation,This work was supported by KAKENHI (17540404) and The Mitsubishi Foundation.,553VG,,,ROTATING SPHERICAL-SHELL; GEODYNAMO SIMULATIONS; DEEP CONVECTION; RAYLEIGH NUMBER; DRIVEN; EQUATIONS; PLANETS; DYNAMOS; FIELD; MODEL,7282.0,NATURE,Nature,English,26.0,No,"Kageyama, Akira/0000-0003-0433-668X","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",11-Feb,5.0,LONDON,20148036.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2010.0,"Kageyama, Akira/H-4537-2013","Kageyama, A (reprint author), Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,36.0,Zonal flow formation in the Earth's core,0.0,19.0,WOS:000274394300036,389.0,463,Multidisciplinary Sciences,36,tetsuya,sato,456.0,16,male,1.0,bpM4ZKkAAAAJ,1,"[0, 1474]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
20,118,487.0,"Pathogenic bacteria using a type III secretion system (T3SS)(1,2) to manipulate host cells cause many different infections including Shigella dysentery, typhoid fever, enterohaemorrhagic colitis and bubonic plague. An essential part of the T3SS is a hollow needle-like protein filament through which effector proteins are injected into eukaryotic host cells(3-6). Currently, the three-dimensional structure of the needle is unknown because it is not amenable to X-ray crystallography and solution NMR, as a result of its inherent non-crystallinity and insolubility. Cryo-electron microscopy combined with crystal or solution NMR subunit structures has recently provided a powerful hybrid approach for studying supramolecular assemblies(7-12), resulting in low-resolution and medium-resolution models(13-17). However, such approaches cannot deliver atomic details, especially of the crucial subunit-subunit interfaces, because of the limited cryo-electron microscopic resolution obtained in these studies. Here we report an alternative approach combining recombinant wild-type needle production, solid-state NMR, electron microscopy and Rosetta modelling to reveal the supramolecular interfaces and ultimately the complete atomic structure of the Salmonella typhimurium T3SS needle. We show that the 80-residue subunits form a right-handed helical assembly with roughly 11 subunits per two turns, similar to that of the flagellar filament of S. typhimurium. In contrast to established models of the needle in which the amino terminus of the protein subunit was assumed to be alpha-helical and positioned inside the needle, our model reveals an extended amino-terminal domain that is positioned on the surface of the needle, while the highly conserved carboxy terminus points towards the lumen.","Loquet, Antoine; Sgourakis, Nikolaos G.; Gupta, Rashmi; Giller, Karin; Riedel, Dietmar; Goosmann, Christian; Griesinger, Christian; Kolbe, Michael; Baker, David; Becker, Stefan; Lange, Adam","Loquet, A; Sgourakis, NG; Gupta, R; Giller, K; Riedel, D; Goosmann, C; Griesinger, C; Kolbe, M; Baker, D; Becker, S; Lange, A",276.0,"[Loquet, Antoine; Giller, Karin; Griesinger, Christian; Becker, Stefan; Lange, Adam] Max Planck Inst Biophys Chem, Dept NMR Based Struct Biol, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Sgourakis, Nikolaos G.; Baker, David] Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Gupta, Rashmi; Kolbe, Michael] Max Planck Inst Infect Biol, Dept Cellular Microbiol, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Riedel, Dietmar] Max Planck Inst Biophys Chem, Lab Electron Microscopy, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Griesinger, Christian] Max Planck Inst Infect Biol, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11079,Article,1476-4687,kolbe@mpiib-berlin.mpg.de; sabe@nmr.mpibpc.mpg.de; adla@nmr.mpibpc.mpg.de,+,Max Planck Society; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Fondation Bettencourt Schueller; National Institutes of Health [1 R01 GM092802-01]; EMBO; European Union [261863],"We thank T.

21,36,110.0,"Non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) and polyketide synthases (PKS) produce numerous secondary metabolites with various therapeutic/antibiotic properties(1). Like fatty acid synthases (FAS), these enzymes are organized in modular assembly lines in which each module, made of conserved domains, incorporates a given monomer unit into the growing chain. Knowledge about domain or module interactions may enable reengineering of this assembly line enzymatic organization and open avenues for the design of new bioactive compounds with improved therapeutic properties. So far, little structural information has been available on how the domains interact and communicate. This may be because of inherent interdomain mobility hindering crystallization, or because crystallized molecules may not represent the active domain orientations(2). In solution, the large size and internal dynamics of multidomain fragments (> 35 kilodaltons) make structure determination by nuclear magnetic resonance a challenge and require advanced technologies. Here we present the solution structure of the apo-thiolation-thioesterase (T-TE) di-domain fragment of the Escherichia coli enterobactin synthetase EntF NRPS subunit. In the holoenzyme, the T domain carries the growing chain tethered to a 4 '-phosphopantetheine whereas the TE domain catalyses hydrolysis and cyclization of the iron chelator enterobactin. The T-TE di-domain forms a compact but dynamic structure with a well-defined domain interface; the two active sites are at a suitable distance for substrate transfer from T to TE. We observe extensive interdomain and intradomain motions forwell-defined regions and show that these are modulated by interactions with proteins that participate in the biosynthesis. The T-TE interaction described here provides a model for NRPS, PKS and FAS function in general as T-TE-like di-domains typically catalyse the last step in numerous assembly-line chain-termination machineries.","Frueh, Dominique P.; Arthanari, Haribabu; Koglin, Alexander; Vosburg, David A.; Bennett, Andrew E.; Walsh, Christopher T.; Wagner, Gerhard","Frueh, DP; Arthanari, H; Koglin, A; Vosburg, DA; Bennett, AE; Walsh, CT; Wagner, G",903.0,"[Frueh, Dominique P.; Arthanari, Haribabu; Koglin, Alexander; Vosburg, David A.; Bennett, Andrew E.; Walsh, Christopher T.; Wagner, Gerhard] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem & Mol Pharmacol, Boston, MA 02115 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07162,Article,,dominique_frueh@hms.harvard.edu; christopher_walsh@hms.harvard.edu; gerhard_wagner@hms.harvard.edu,U62,"NIBIB NIH HHS [EB 002026, P41 EB002026, P41 EB002026-28, P41 EB002026-29, P41 EB002026-30, P41 EB002026-31, P41 EB002026-32, P41 EB002026-33]; NIGMS NIH HHS [P41 GM066360-04, GM066360, GM47467, P01 GM047467, P01 GM047467-11, P01 GM047467-110009, P01 GM047467-12, P01 GM047467-13, P01 GM047467-14, P01 GM047467-15, P01 GM047467-16, P01 GM047467-160012, P01 GM047467-17, P01 GM047467-170012, P41 GM066360, P41 GM066360-01, P41 GM066360-02, P41 GM066360-03, P41 GM066360-05]",,336XH,,,ACYL CARRIER PROTEIN; FATTY-ACID SYNTHASE; TRIPLE-RESONANCE EXPERIMENTS; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; MACROMOLECULAR STRUCTURE; C-13 MAGNETIZATION; NMR-SPECTROSCOPY; CHEMICAL-SHIFT; SWISS-MODEL; RESOLUTION,7206.0,NATURE,Nature,English,46.0,No,"Frueh, Dominique/0000-0003-4605-3776","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",14-Aug,5.0,LONDON,18704088.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,"Frueh, Dominique/A-6462-2008","Wagner, G (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem & Mol Pharmacol, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,99.0,Dynamic thiolation-thioesterase structure of a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase,0.0,35.0,WOS:000258398600040,110.0,454,Multidisciplinary Sciences,99,gerhard,wagner,120.0,49,male,1.0,OnNtJjAAAAAJ,1,"[0, 1474]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
22,109,258.0,"Epigenetic information is frequently erased near the start of each new generation(1). In some cases, however, epigenetic information can be transmitted from parent to progeny (multigenerational epigenetic inheritance)(2). A particularly notable example of this type of epigenetic inheritance is double-stranded RNA-mediated gene silencing in Caenorhabditis elegans. This RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) can be inherited for more than five generations(3-8). To understand this process, here we conduct a genetic screen for nematodes defective in transmitting RNAi silencing signals to future generations. This screen identified the heritable RNAi defective 1 (hrde-1) gene. hrde-1 encodes an Argonaute protein that associates with small interfering RNAs in the germ cells of progeny of animals exposed to double-stranded RNA. In the nuclei of these germ cells, HRDE-1 engages the nuclear RNAi defective pathway to direct the trimethylation of histone H3 at Lys 9 (H3K9me3) at RNAi-targeted genomic loci and promote RNAi inheritance. Under normal growth conditions, HRDE-1 associates with endogenously expressed short interfering RNAs, which direct nuclear gene silencing in germ cells. In hrde-1- or nuclear RNAi-deficient animals, germline silencing is lost over generational time. Concurrently, these animals exhibit steadily worsening defects in gamete formation and function that ultimately lead to sterility. These results establish that the Argonaute protein HRDE-1 directs gene-silencing events in germ-cell nuclei that drive multigenerational RNAi inheritance and promote immortality of the germ-cell lineage. We propose that C. elegans use the RNAi inheritance machinery to transmit epigenetic information, accrued by past generations, into future generations to regulate important biological processes.","Buckley, Bethany A.; Burkhart, Kirk B.; Gu, Sam Guoping; Spracklin, George; Kershner, Aaron; Fritz, Heidi; Kimble, Judith; Fire, Andrew; Kennedy, Scott","Buckley, BA; Burkhart, KB; Gu, SG; Spracklin, G; Kershner, A; Fritz, H; Kimble, J; Fire, A; Kennedy, S",447.0,"[Buckley, Bethany A.; Burkhart, Kirk B.; Spracklin, George; Fritz, Heidi; Kimble, Judith; Kennedy, Scott] Univ Wisconsin, Lab Genet, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Gu, Sam Guoping; Fire, Andrew] Stanford Univ, Dept Pathol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Gu, Sam Guoping; Fire, Andrew] Stanford Univ, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kershner, Aaron; Fritz, Heidi] Univ Wisconsin, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Kershner, Aaron; Kimble, Judith] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biochem, Madison, WI 53706 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11352,Article,,sgkennedy@wisc.edu,451,"Pew scholar's program; Shaw scholar's program; National Institutes of Health [GM88289, GM37706, GM069454]","We thank P.

23,45,182.0,"The microtubule cytoskeleton is essential to cell morphogenesis. Growing microtubule plus ends have emerged as dynamic regulatory sites in which specialized proteins, called plus- end- binding proteins ( + TIPs), bind and regulate the proper functioning of microtubules(1-4). However, the molecular mechanism of plus- end association by + TIPs and their ability to track the growing end are not well understood. Here we report the in vitro reconstitution of a minimal plus- end tracking system consisting of the three fission yeast proteins Mal3, Tip1 and the kinesin Tea2. Using time- lapse total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we show that the EB1 homologue Mal3 has an enhanced affinity for growing microtubule end structures as opposed to the microtubule lattice. This allows it to track growing microtubule ends autonomously by an end recognition mechanism. In addition, Mal3 acts as a factor that mediates loading of the processive motor Tea2 and its cargo, the Clip170 homologue Tip1, onto the microtubule lattice. The interaction of all three proteins is required for the selective tracking of growing microtubule plus ends by both Tea2 and Tip1. Our results dissect the collective interactions of the constituents of this plus-end tracking system and show how these interactions lead to the emergence of its dynamic behaviour. We expect that such in vitro reconstitutions will also be essential for the mechanistic dissection of other plus- end tracking systems.","Bieling, Peter; Laan, Liedewij; Schek, Henry; Munteanu, E.

24,11,212.0,"Variation in transcriptional regulation is thought to be a major cause of phenotypic diversity(1,2). Although widespread differences in gene expression among individuals of a species have been observed(3-8), studies to examine the variability of transcription factor binding on a global scale have not been performed, and thus the extent and underlying genetic basis of transcription factor binding diversity is unknown. By mapping differences in transcription factor binding among individuals, here we present the genetic basis of such variation on a genome-wide scale. Whole-genome Ste12-binding profiles were determined using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with DNA sequencing in pheromone-treated cells of 43 segregants of a cross between two highly diverged yeast strains and their parental lines. We identified extensive Ste12-binding variation among individuals, and mapped underlying cis- and trans-acting loci responsible for such variation. We showed that most transcription factor binding variation is cis- linked, and that many variations are associated with polymorphisms residing in the binding motifs of Ste12 as well as those of several proposed Ste12 cofactors. We also identified two transfactors, AMN1 and FLO8, that modulate Ste12 binding to promoters of more than ten genes under alpha-factor treatment. Neither of these two genes was previously known to regulate Ste12, and we suggest that they may be mediators of gene activity and phenotypic diversity. Ste12 binding strongly correlates with gene expression for more than 200 genes, indicating that binding variation is functional. Many of the variable-bound genes are involved in cell wall organization and biogenesis. Overall, these studies identified genetic regulators of molecular diversity among individuals and provide new insights into mechanisms of gene regulation.","Zheng, Wei; Zhao, Hongyu; Mancera, Eugenio; Steinmetz, Lars M.; Snyder, Michael","Zheng, W; Zhao, HY; Mancera, E; Steinmetz, LM; Snyder, M",1187.0,"[Zheng, Wei; Snyder, Michael] Yale Univ, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Zhao, Hongyu] Yale Univ, Program Computat Biol & Bioinformat, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Zhao, Hongyu] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Mancera, Eugenio; Steinmetz, Lars M.] European Mol Biol Lab, Genome Biol Unit, Heidelberg, Germany; [Snyder, Michael] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08934,Article,,mpsnyder@stanford.edu,U106,National Institutes of Health (NIH) [RR19895],"We thank J.

25,15,329.0,"Although bisexual reproduction has proven to be highly successful, parthenogenetic all-female populations occur frequently in certain taxa, including the whiptail lizards of the genus Aspidoscelis. Allozyme analysis revealed a high degree of fixed heterozygosity in these parthenogenetic species(1,2), supporting the view that they originated from hybridization events between related sexual species. It has remained unclear how the meiotic program is altered to produce diploid eggs while maintaining heterozygosity. Here we show that meiosis commences with twice the number of chromosomes in parthenogenetic versus sexual species, a mechanism that provides the basis for generating gametes with unreduced chromosome content without fundamental deviation from the classic meiotic program. Our observation of synaptonemal complexes and chiasmata demonstrate that a typical meiotic program occurs and that heterozygosity is not maintained by bypassing recombination. Instead, fluorescent in situ hybridization probes that distinguish between homologues reveal that bivalents form between sister chromosomes, the genetically identical products of the first of two premeiotic replication cycles. Sister chromosome pairing provides a mechanism for the maintenance of heterozygosity, which is critical for offsetting the reduced fitness associated with the lack of genetic diversity in parthenogenetic species.","Lutes, Aracely A.; Neaves, William B.; Baumann, Diana P.; Wiegraebe, Winfried; Baumann, Peter","Lutes, AA; Neaves, WB; Baumann, DP; Wiegraebe, W; Baumann, P",283.0,"[Lutes, Aracely A.; Neaves, William B.; Baumann, Diana P.; Wiegraebe, Winfried; Baumann, Peter] Stowers Inst Med Res, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; [Lutes, Aracely A.; Baumann, Peter] Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Dept Mol & Integrat Physiol, Kansas City, KS 66160 USA; [Neaves, William B.] Univ Missouri, Sch Med, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; [Baumann, Peter] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08818,Article,,peb@stowers.org,U164,Stowers Institute for Medical Research; Pew Charitable Trusts,"We thank the staff of the Reptile Facility for their dedication to animal husbandry; C.

26,70,27.0,"The United States is now experiencing the most rapid expansion in oil and gas production in four decades, owing in large part to implementation of new extraction technologies such as horizontal drilling combined with hydraulic fracturing. The environmental impacts of this development, from its effect on water quality(1) to the influence of increased methane leakage on climate(2), have been a matter of intense debate. Air quality impacts are associated with emissions of nitrogen oxides(3,4) (NOx = NO + NO2) and volatile organic compounds(5-7) (VOCs), whose photochemistry leads to production of ozone, a secondary pollutant with negative health effects(8). Recent observations in oil-and gas-producing basins in the western United States have identified ozone mixing ratios well in excess of present air quality standards, but only during winter(9-13). Understanding winter ozone production in these regions is scientifically challenging. It occurs during cold periods of snow cover when meteorological inversions concentrate air pollutants from oil and gas activities, but when solar irradiance and absolute humidity, which are both required to initiate conventional photochemistry essential for ozone production, are at a minimum. Here, using data from a remote location in the oil and gas basin of northeastern Utah and a box model, we provide a quantitative assessment of the photochemistry that leads to these extreme winter ozone pollution events, and identify key factors that control ozone production in this unique environment. We find that ozone production occurs at lower NOx and much larger VOC concentrations than does its summertime urban counterpart, leading to carbonyl (oxygenated VOCs with a C=O moiety) photolysis as a dominant oxidant source. Extreme VOC concentrations optimize the ozone production efficiency of NOx. There is considerable potential for global growth in oil and gas extraction from shale. This analysis could help inform strategies to monitor and mitigate air quality impacts and provide broader insight into the response of winter ozone to primary pollutants.","Edwards, Peter M.; Brown, Steven S.; Roberts, James M.; Ahmadov, Ravan; Banta, Robert M.; deGouw, Joost A.; Dube, William P.; Field, Robert A.; Flynn, James H.; Gilman, Jessica B.; Graus, Martin; Helmig, Detlev; Koss, Abigail; Langford, Andrew O.; Lefer, Barry L.; Lerner, Brian M.; Li, Rui; Li, Shao-Meng; McKeen, Stuart A.; Murphy, Shane M.; Parrish, David D.; Senff, Christoph J.; Soltis, Jeffrey; Stutz, Jochen; Sweeney, Colm; Thompson, Chelsea R.; Trainer, Michael K.; Tsai, Catalina; Veres, Patrick R.; Washenfelder, Rebecca A.; Warneke, Carsten; Wild, Robert J.; Young, Cora J.; Yuan, Bin; Zamora, Robert","Edwards, PM; Brown, SS; Roberts, JM; Ahmadov, R; Banta, RM; deGouw, JA; Dube, WP; Field, RA; Flynn, JH; Gilman, JB; Graus, M; Helmig, D; Koss, A; Langford, AO; Lefer, BL; Lerner, BM; Li, R; Li, SM; McKeen, SA; Murphy, SM; Parrish, DD; Senff, CJ; Soltis, J; Stutz, J; Sweeney, C; Thompson, CR; Trainer, MK; Tsai, C; Veres, PR; Washenfelder, RA; Warneke, C; Wild, RJ; Young, CJ; Yuan, B; Zamora, R",351.0,"[Edwards, Peter M.; Brown, Steven S.; Roberts, James M.; Ahmadov, Ravan; Banta, Robert M.; deGouw, Joost A.; Dube, William P.; Gilman, Jessica B.; Graus, Martin; Koss, Abigail; Langford, Andrew O.; Lerner, Brian M.; Li, Rui; McKeen, Stuart A.; Parrish, David D.; Senff, Christoph J.; Sweeney, Colm; Trainer, Michael K.; Veres, Patrick R.; Washenfelder, Rebecca A.; Warneke, Carsten; Wild, Robert J.; Young, Cora J.; Yuan, Bin; Zamora, Robert] NOAA, Earth Syst Res Lab, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; [Edwards, Peter M.; Ahmadov, Ravan; deGouw, Joost A.; Dube, William P.; Gilman, Jessica B.; Graus, Martin; Koss, Abigail; Lerner, Brian M.; Li, Rui; McKeen, Stuart A.; Senff, Christoph J.; Sweeney, Colm; Veres, Patrick R.; Washenfelder, Rebecca A.; Warneke, Carsten; Wild, Robert J.; Yuan, Bin] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Field, Robert A.; Murphy, Shane M.; Soltis, Jeffrey] Univ Wyoming, Dept Atmospher Sci, Larmie, WY 82070 USA; [Flynn, James H.; Lefer, Barry L.] Univ Houston, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Houston, TX 77204 USA; [Helmig, Detlev; Thompson, Chelsea R.] Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Li, Shao-Meng] Environm Canada, Air Qual Res Div, Toronto, ON M3H 5T4, Canada; [Stutz, Jochen; Tsai, Catalina] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13767,Article,1476-4687,steven.s.brown@noaa.gov,+,"Uintah Impact Mitigation Special Service District (UIMSSD); Bureau of Land Management (BLM); Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); Utah State University; Western Energy Alliance; NOAA's Atmospheric Chemistry, Climate and Carbon Cycle programme; Questar Energy Products; National Science Foundation [1212666, 1215926]","The Uintah Basin Winter Ozone Studies were a joint project led and coordinated by the Utah Department of Environmental Quality (UDEQ) and supported by the Uintah Impact Mitigation Special Service District (UIMSSD), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Utah State University.

27,99,268.0,"In vertebrate development, the body plan is determined by primordial morphogen gradients that suffuse the embryo. Retinoic acid (RA) is an important morphogen involved in patterning the anterior-posterior axis of structures, including the hindbrain(1-6) and paraxial mesoderm(7,8). RA diffuses over long distances, and its activity is spatially restricted by synthesizing and degrading enzymes(9). However, gradients of endogenous morphogens in live embryos have not been directly observed; indeed, their existence, distribution and requirement for correct patterning remain controversial(10). Here we report a family of genetically encoded indicators for RA that we have termed GEPRAs (genetically encoded probes for RA). Using the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer we engineered the ligand-binding domains of RA receptors to incorporate cyan-emitting and yellow-emitting fluorescent proteins as fluorescence resonance energy transfer donor and acceptor, respectively, for the reliable detection of ambient free RA. We created three GEPRAs with different affinities for RA, enabling the quantitative measurement of physiological RA concentrations. Live imaging of zebrafish embryos at the gastrula and somitogenesis stages revealed a linear concentration gradient of endogenous RA in a two-tailed source-sink arrangement across the embryo. Modelling of the observed linear RA gradient suggests that the rate of RA diffusion exceeds the spatiotemporal dynamics of embryogenesis, resulting in stability to perturbation. Furthermore, we used GEPRAs in combination with genetic and pharmacological perturbations to resolve competing hypotheses on the structure of the RA gradient during hindbrain formation and somitogenesis. Live imaging of endogenous concentration gradients across embryonic development will allow the precise assignment of molecular mechanisms to developmental dynamics and will accelerate the application of approaches based on morphogen gradients to tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.","Shimozono, Satoshi; Iimura, Tadahiro; Kitaguchi, Tetsuya; Higashijima, Shin-ichi; Miyawaki, Atsushi","Shimozono, S; Iimura, T; Kitaguchi, T; Higashijima, S; Miyawaki, A",363.0,"[Shimozono, Satoshi; Iimura, Tadahiro; Miyawaki, Atsushi] RIKEN, Brain Sci Inst, Lab Cell Funct Dynam, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Kitaguchi, Tetsuya; Miyawaki, Atsushi] JST, ERATO, Life Funct & Dynam, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Higashijima, Shin-ichi] Natl Inst Nat Sci, Okazaki Inst Integrat Biosci, Natl Inst Physiol Sci, Okazaki, Aichi 4448787, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12037,Article,1476-4687,matsushi@brain.riken.jp,+,"Japan Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology; Human Frontier Science Program","The authors thank Y.

28,5,65.0,"Eukaryotic cells express a wide variety of endogenous small regulatory RNAs that regulate heterochromatin formation, developmental timing, defence against parasitic nucleic acids and genome rearrangement. Many small regulatory RNAs are thought to function in nuclei(1,2). For instance, in plants and fungi, short interfering RNA (siRNAs) associate with nascent transcripts and direct chromatin and/or DNA modifications(1,2). To understand further the biological roles of small regulatory RNAs, we conducted a genetic screen to identify factors required for RNA interference (RNAi) in Caenorhabditis elegans nuclei(3). Here we show that the gene nuclear RNAi defective-2 (nrde-2) encodes an evolutionarily conserved protein that is required for siRNA-mediated silencing in nuclei. NRDE-2 associates with the Argonaute protein NRDE-3 within nuclei and is recruited by NRDE-3/siRNA complexes to nascent transcripts that have been targeted by RNAi. We find that nuclear-localized siRNAs direct an NRDE-2-dependent silencing of pre-messenger RNAs (pre-mRNAs) 3' to sites of RNAi, an NRDE-2-dependent accumulation of RNA polymerase (RNAP) II at genomic loci targeted by RNAi, and NRDE-2-dependent decreases in RNAP II occupancy and RNAP II transcriptional activity 39 to sites of RNAi. These results define NRDE-2 as a component of the nuclear RNAi machinery and demonstrate that metazoan siRNAs can silence nuclear-localized RNAs co-transcriptionally. In addition, these results establish a novel mode of RNAP II regulation: siRNA-directed recruitment of NRDE factors that inhibit RNAP II during the elongation phase of transcription.","Guang, Shouhong; Bochner, Aaron F.; Burkhart, Kirk B.; Burton, Nick; Pavelec, Derek M.; Kennedy, Scott","Guang, SH; Bochner, AF; Burkhart, KB; Burton, N; Pavelec, DM; Kennedy, S",1097.0,"[Guang, Shouhong; Bochner, Aaron F.; Burkhart, Kirk B.; Burton, Nick; Kennedy, Scott] Univ Wisconsin, Genet Lab, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Pavelec, Derek M.; Kennedy, Scott] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Pharmacol, Madison, WI 53706 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09095,Article,,sgkennedy@wisc.edu,U165,Pew and Shaw scholars programmes; National Institutes of Health; American Heart Association,"We thank P.

29,80,251.0,"The urban heat island(UHI), a common phenomenon in which surface temperatures are higher in urban areas than in surrounding rural areas, represents one of the most significant human-induced changes to Earth's surface climate(1,2). Even though they are localized hotspots in the landscape, UHIs have a profound impact on the lives of urban residents, who comprise more than half of the world's population(3). A barrier to UHI mitigation is the lack of quantitative attribution of the various contributions to UHI intensity(4) (expressed as the temperature difference between urban and rural areas, Delta T). A common perception is that reduction in evaporative cooling in urban land is the dominant driver of DT (ref. 5). Here we use a climate model to show that, for cities across North America, geographic variations in daytime Delta T are largely explained by variations in the efficiency with which urban and rural areas convect heat to the lower atmosphere. If urban areas are aerodynamically smoother than surrounding rural areas, urban heat dissipation is relatively less efficient and urban warming occurs (and vice versa). This convection effect depends on the local background climate, increasing daytime Delta T by 3.06 +/- 0.3 kelvin (mean and standard error) in humid climates but decreasing Delta T by 1.5 +/- 0.2 kelvin in dry climates. In the humid eastern United States, there is evidence of higher Delta T in drier years. These relationship simply that UHIs will exacerbate heat wave stress on human health in wet climates where high temperature effects are already compounded by high air humidity(6,7) and in drier years when positive temperature anomalies may be reinforced by a precipitation temperature feedback(8). Our results support albedo management as a viable means of reducing Delta T on large scales(9,10).","Zhao, Lei; Lee, Xuhui; Smith, Ronald B.; Oleson, Keith","Zhao, L; Lee, X; Smith, RB; Oleson, K",216.0,"[Zhao, Lei; Lee, Xuhui] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Yale NUIST Ctr Atmospher Environm, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Lei; Lee, Xuhui] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Smith, Ronald B.] Yale Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Oleson, Keith] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80305 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13462,Article,1476-4687,xuhui.lee@yale.edu,219,Ministry of Education of China (grant PCSIRT); Yale Climate and Energy Institute; Yale Institute of Biospheric Studies; Yale University Graduate Fellowship; NASA [NNX10AK79G]; NCARWCIASP; US National Science Foundation,"This research was supported by the Ministry of Education of China (grant PCSIRT), the Yale Climate and Energy Institute, the Yale Institute of Biospheric Studies, and a Yale University Graduate Fellowship.

30,128,85.0,"Inhomogeneity-induced magnetoresistance (IMR) reported in some non-magnetic semiconductors(1-8), particularly silicon(1,6-8), has generated considerable interest owing to the large magnitude of the effect and its linear field dependence (albeit at high magnetic fields). Various theories implicate(9-18) spatial variation of the carrier mobility as being responsible for IMR. Here we show that IMR in lightly doped silicon can be significantly enhanced through hole injection, and then tuned by an applied current to arise at low magnetic fields. In our devices, the 'inhomogeneity' is provided by the p-n boundary formed between regions where conduction is dominated by the minority and majority charge carriers (holes and electrons) respectively; application of a magnetic field distorts the current in the boundary region, resulting in large magnetoresistance. Because this is an intrinsically spatial effect, the geometry of the device can be used to enhance IMR further: we designed an IMR device whose room-temperature field sensitivity at low fields was greatly improved, with magnetoresistance reaching 10% at 0.07 T and 100% at 0.2 T, approaching the performance of commercial giant-magnetoresistance devices(19,20). The combination of high sensitivity to low magnetic fields and large high-field response should make this device concept attractive to the magnetic-field sensing industry. Moreover, because our device is based on a conventional silicon platform, it should be possible to integrate it with existing silicon devices and so aid the development of silicon-based magnetoelectronics.","Wan, Caihua; Zhang, Xiaozhong; Gao, Xili; Wang, Jimin; Tan, Xinyu","Wan, CH; Zhang, XZ; Gao, XL; Wang, JM; Tan, XY",304.0,"[Wan, Caihua; Zhang, Xiaozhong; Gao, Xili; Wang, Jimin; Tan, Xinyu] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Adv Mat Lab, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Wan, Caihua; Zhang, Xiaozhong; Gao, Xili; Wang, Jimin; Tan, Xinyu] Tsinghua Univ, Beijing Natl Ctr Electron Microscopy, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10375,Article,,xzzhang@tsinghua.edu.cn,U68,"Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2009CB929202]; National Science Foundation of China [11074141, U0734001]",This work is supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (grant 2009CB929202) and the National Science Foundation of China (grants 11074141 and U0734001).

31,151,68.0,"Electrons in a metal are indistinguishable particles that interact strongly with other electrons and their environment. Isolating and detecting a single flying electron after propagation, in a similar manner to quantum optics experiments with single photons(1,2), is therefore a challenging task. So far only a few experiments have been performed in a high-mobility two-dimensional electron gas in which the electron propagates almost ballistically(3-5). In these previous works, flying electrons were detected by means of the current generated by an ensemble of electrons, and electron correlations were encrypted in the current noise. Here we demonstrate the experimental realization of high-efficiency single-electron source and detector for a single electron propagating isolated from the other electrons through a one-dimensional channel. The moving potential is excited by a surface acoustic wave, which carries the single electron along the one-dimensional channel at a speed of 3 mu m ns(-1). When this quantum channel is placed between two quantum dots several micrometres apart, a single electron can be transported from one quantum dot to the other with quantum efficiencies of emission and detection of 96% and 92%, respectively. Furthermore, the transfer of the electron can be triggered on a timescale shorter than the coherence time T-2* of GaAs spin qubits(6). Our work opens new avenues with which to study the teleportation of a single electron spin and the distant interaction between spatially separated qubits in a condensed-matter system.","Hermelin, Sylvain; Takada, Shintaro; Yamamoto, Michihisa; Tarucha, Seigo; Wieck, Andreas D.; Saminadayar, Laurent; Baeuerle, Christopher; Meunier, Tristan","Hermelin, S; Takada, S; Yamamoto, M; Tarucha, S; Wieck, AD; Saminadayar, L; Bauerle, C; Meunier, T",435.0,"[Hermelin, Sylvain; Saminadayar, Laurent; Baeuerle, Christopher; Meunier, Tristan] CNRS, Inst Neel, F-38042 Grenoble, France; [Hermelin, Sylvain; Saminadayar, Laurent; Baeuerle, Christopher; Meunier, Tristan] Univ Grenoble 1, F-38042 Grenoble, France; [Takada, Shintaro; Yamamoto, Michihisa; Tarucha, Seigo] Univ Tokyo, Dept Appl Phys, Tokyo 1138656, Japan; [Yamamoto, Michihisa] ERATO JST, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3310012, Japan; [Tarucha, Seigo] ICORP Int Cooperat Res Project Quantum Spin Infor, Atsugi, Kanagawa 2430198, Japan; [Wieck, Andreas D.] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Lehrstuhl Angew Festkorperphys, D-44780 Bochum, Germany; [Saminadayar, Laurent] Inst Univ France, F-75005 Paris, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10416,Article,,bauerle@grenoble.cnrs.fr; tristan.meunier@grenoble.cnrs.fr,438,"ERATO-JST [080300000477]; Special Coordination Funds for Promoting Science and Technology (NanoQuine); Japan Science and Technology Agency Strategic International Cooperative Program; Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology; Harvard University; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SPP1285]; Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung [QuaHLRep 01BQ1035]; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (DREI) - Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [PRC 424, L08519]; Marie-Curie European Reintegration Grant [224786]; Nanoscience Foundation of Grenoble;  [20684011]","We thank Y.

Our studies reveal the spatial arrangement of ubiquitin receptors, deubiquitinating enzymes and the protein unfolding machinery at subnanometre resolution, outlining the substrate's path to degradation. Unexpectedly, the ATPase subunits within the base unfoldase are arranged in a spiral staircase, providing insight into potential mechanisms for substrate translocation through the central pore. Large conformational rearrangements of the lid upon holoenzyme formation suggest allosteric regulation of deubiquitination.

34,141,204.0,"The biogeochemical cycles of iron and organic carbon are strongly interlinked. In oceanic waters, organic ligands have been shown to control the concentration of dissolved iron(1). In soils, solid iron phases shelter and preserve organic carbon(2), but the role of iron in the preservation of organic matter in sediments has not been clearly established. Here we use an iron reduction method previously applied to soils(3) to determine the amount of organic carbon associated with reactive iron phases in sediments of various mineralogies collected from a wide range of depositional environments. Our findings suggest that 21.5 +/- 8.6 per cent of the organic carbon in sediments is directly bound to reactive iron phases. We further estimate that a global mass of (19-45) x 10(15) grams of organic carbon is preserved in surface marine sediments as a result of its association with iron(4). We propose that these associations between organic carbon and iron, which are formed primarily through co-precipitation and/or direct chelation, promote the preservation of organic carbon in sediments. Because reactive iron phases are metastable over geological timescales, we suggest that they serve as an efficient 'rusty sink' for organic carbon, acting as a key factor in the long-term storage of organic carbon and thus contributing to the global cycles of carbon, oxygen and sulphur(5).","Lalonde, Karine; Mucci, Alfonso; Ouellet, Alexandre; Gelinas, Yves","Lalonde, K; Mucci, A; Ouellet, A; Gelinas, Y",198.0,"[Lalonde, Karine; Ouellet, Alexandre; Gelinas, Yves] Concordia Univ, GEOTOP, Montreal, PQ H4B 1R6, Canada; [Lalonde, Karine; Ouellet, Alexandre; Gelinas, Yves] Concordia Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem, Montreal, PQ H4B 1R6, Canada; [Mucci, Alfonso] McGill Univ, GEOTOP, Montreal, PQ H3A 2A7, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10855,Article,,ygelinas@alcor.concordia.ca,200,NSERC; CFI; FQRNT,"This work is dedicated to the memory of J.I.

35,98,461.0,"Increases in brain blood flow, evoked by neuronal activity, power neural computation and form the basis of BOLD(blood-oxygen-level-dependent) functional imaging. Whether blood flow is controlled solely by arteriole smooth muscle, or also by capillary pericytes, is controversial. We demonstrate that neuronal activity and the neurotransmitter glutamate evoke the release of messengers that dilate capillaries by actively relaxing pericytes. Dilation is mediated by prostaglandin E-2, but requires nitric oxide release to suppress vasoconstricting 20-HETE synthesis. In vivo, when sensory input increases blood flow, capillaries dilate before arterioles and are estimated to produce 84% of the blood flow increase. In pathology, ischaemia evokes capillary constriction by pericytes. We show that this is followed by pericyte death in rigor, which may irreversibly constrict capillaries and damage the blood-brain barrier. Thus, pericytes are major regulators of cerebral blood flow and initiators of functional imaging signals. Prevention of pericyte constriction and death may reduce the long-lasting blood flow decrease that damages neurons after stroke.","Hall, Catherine N.; Reynell, Clare; Gesslein, Bodil; Hamilton, Nicola B.; Mishra, Anusha; Sutherland, Brad A.; O'Farrell, Fergus M.; Buchan, Alastair M.; Lauritzen, Martin; Attwell, David","Hall, CN; Reynell, C; Gesslein, B; Hamilton, NB; Mishra, A; Sutherland, BA; O'Farrell, FM; Buchan, AM; Lauritzen, M; Attwell, D",55.0,"[Hall, Catherine N.; Reynell, Clare; Hamilton, Nicola B.; Mishra, Anusha; O'Farrell, Fergus M.; Attwell, David] UCL, Dept Neurosci Physiol & Pharmacol, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Gesslein, Bodil; Lauritzen, Martin] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Neurosci & Pharmacol, DK-2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark; [Gesslein, Bodil; Lauritzen, Martin] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Hlth Aging, DK-2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark; [Sutherland, Brad A.; Buchan, Alastair M.] Univ Oxford, Radcliffe Dept Med, Acute Stroke Programme, Oxford OX3 9DU, England; [Lauritzen, Martin] Glostrup Univ Hosp, Dept Clin Neurophysiol, DK-2600 Glostrup, Denmark",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13165,Article,1476-4687,mlauritz@sund.ku.dk; d.attwell@ucl.ac.uk,+,Fondation Leducq; European Research Council; Wellcome Trust; UK Medical Research Council; Rosetrees Trust; Nordea Foundation via the Center for Healthy Aging; Lundbeck Foundation; NOVO-Nordisk Foundation; Danish Medical Research Council,"We thank B.

Here we report the most complete structure obtained so far, to our knowledge, of the 380-kDa motor domain of Dictyostelium discoideum cytoplasmic dynein at 2.8 angstrom resolution; the data are reliable enough to discuss the structure and mechanism at the level of individual amino acid residues. Features that can be clearly visualized at this resolution include the coordination of ADP in each of four distinct nucleotide-binding sites in the ring-shaped AAA(+) ATPase unit, a newly identified interaction interface between the ring and mechanical linker, and junctional structures between the ring and microtubule-binding stalk, all of which should be critical for the mechanism of dynein motility. We also identify a long-range allosteric communication pathway between the primary ATPase and the microtubule-binding sites.

37,66,169.0,"Over a century of research into the origin of turbulence in wall-bounded shear flows has resulted in a puzzling picture in which turbulence appears in a variety of different states competing with laminar background flow(1-6). At moderate flow speeds, turbulence is confined to localized patches; it is only at higher speeds that the entire flow becomes turbulent. The origin of the different states encountered during this transition, the front dynamics of the turbulent regions and the transformation to full turbulence have yet to be explained. By combining experiments, theory and computer simulations, here we uncover a bifurcation scenario that explains the transformation to fully turbulent pipe flow and describe the front dynamics of the different states encountered in the process. Key to resolving this problem is the interpretation of the flow as a bistable system with nonlinear propagation (advection) of turbulent fronts. These findings bridge the gap between our understanding of the onset of turbulence(7) and fully turbulent flows(8,9).","Barkley, Dwight; Song, Baofang; Mukund, Vasudevan; Lemoult, Gregoire; Avila, Marc; Hof, Bjoern","Barkley, D; Song, BF; Mukund, V; Lemoult, G; Avila, M; Hof, B",550.0,"[Barkley, Dwight] Univ Warwick, Inst Math, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Song, Baofang; Mukund, Vasudevan; Lemoult, Gregoire; Hof, Bjoern] IST Austria, A-3400 Klosterneuburg, Austria; [Song, Baofang] Max Planck Inst Dynam & Self Org, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Song, Baofang] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Inst Multiscale Simulat, D-91052 Erlangen, Germany; [Avila, Marc] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Inst Fluid Mech, D-91058 Erlangen, Germany",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15701,Article,1476-4687,D.Barkley@warwick.ac.uk; bhof@ist.ac.at,U191,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [FOR 1182]; European Research Council under the European Union [306589]; Chinese State Scholarship Fund [2010629145]; International Max Planck Research School for the Physics of Biological and Complex Systems; Gottingen Graduate School for Neurosciences and Molecular Biosciences; Julich Supercomputing Centre [HGU16],"We thank A.

38,69,196.0,"HIV-1 Nef, a protein important for the development of AIDS, has well-characterized effects on host membrane trafficking and receptor downregulation. By an unidentified mechanism, Nef increases the intrinsic infectivity of HIV-1 virions in a host-cell-dependent manner. Here we identify the host transmembrane protein SERINC5, and to a lesser extent SERINC3, as a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 particle infectivity that is counteracted by Nef. SERINC5 localizes to the plasma membrane, where it is efficiently incorporated into budding HIV-1 virions and impairs subsequent virion penetration of susceptible target cells. Nef redirects SERINC5 to a Rab7-positive endosomal compartment and thereby excludes it from HIV-1 particles. The ability to counteract SERINC5 was conserved in Nef encoded by diverse primate immunodeficiency viruses, as well as in the structurally unrelated glycosylated Gag from murine leukaemia virus. These examples of functional conservation and convergent evolution emphasize the fundamental importance of SERINC5 as a potent anti-retroviral factor.","Rosa, Annachiara; Chande, Ajit; Ziglio, Serena; De Sanctis, Veronica; Bertorelli, Roberto; Goh, Shih Lin; McCauley, Sean M.; Nowosielska, Anetta; Antonarakis, Stylianos E.; Luban, Jeremy; Santoni, Federico Andrea; Pizzato, Massimo","Rosa, A; Chande, A; Ziglio, S; De Sanctis, V; Bertorelli, R; Goh, SL; McCauley, SM; Nowosielska, A; Antonarakis, SE; Luban, J; Santoni, FA; Pizzato, M",212.0,"[Rosa, Annachiara; Chande, Ajit; Ziglio, Serena; Pizzato, Massimo] Univ Trent, Ctr Integrat Biol, I-38123 Trento, Italy; [De Sanctis, Veronica; Bertorelli, Roberto] Univ Trent, Lab Biomol Sequence & Struct Anal Hlth, NGS Facil, I-38123 Trento, Italy; [Goh, Shih Lin; McCauley, Sean M.; Nowosielska, Anetta; Luban, Jeremy] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Program Mol Med, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Antonarakis, Stylianos E.; Santoni, Federico Andrea] Univ Geneva, Dept Genet Med & Dev, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Antonarakis, Stylianos E.] IGE3 Inst Genet & Genom Geneva, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15399,Article,1476-4687,massimo.pizzato@unitn.it,+,University of Trento; FP7 Marie Curie Career Integration grant [322130]; Caritro 'Ricerca Biomedica' grant [2013.0248]; National Institute of Health [DP1DA034990]; European Research Council [249968],"We thank the Centre for AIDS Reagents, NIBSC, and NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, for cell lines, plasmids and antibodies.

39,86,146.0,"Bone-resorbing osteoclasts significantly contribute to osteoporosis and bone metastases of cancer(1-3). MicroRNAs play important roles in physiology and disease(4,5), and present tremendous therapeutic potential(6). Nonetheless, how microRNAs regulate skeletal biology is underexplored. Here we identify miR-34a as a novel and critical suppressor of osteoclastogenesis, bone resorption and the bone metastatic niche. miR-34a is downregulated during osteoclast differentiation. Osteoclastic miR-34a-overexpressing transgenic mice exhibit lower bone resorption and higher bone mass. Conversely, miR-34a knockout and heterozygous mice exhibit elevated bone resorption and reduced bone mass. Consequently, ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis, as well as bone metastasis of breast and skin cancers, are diminished in osteoclastic miR-34a transgenic mice, and can be effectively attenuated by miR-34a nanoparticle treatment. Mechanistically, we identify transforming growth factor-beta-induced factor 2 (Tgif2) as an essential direct miR-34a target that is pro-osteoclastogenic. Tgif2 deletion reduces bone resorption and abolishes miR-34a regulation. Together, using mouse genetic, pharmacological and disease models, we reveal miR-34a as a key osteoclast suppressor and a potential therapeutic strategy to confer skeletal protection and ameliorate bone metastasis of cancers.","Krzeszinski, Jing Y.; Wei, Wei; HoangDinh Huynh; Jin, Zixue; Wang, Xunde; Chang, Tsung-Cheng; Xie, Xian-Jin; He, Lin; Mangala, Lingegowda S.; Lopez-Berestein, Gabriel; Sood, Anil K.; Mendell, Joshua T.; Wan, Yihong","Krzeszinski, JY; Wei, W; Huynh, H; Jin, ZX; Wang, XD; Chang, TC; Xie, XJ; He, L; Mangala, LS; Lopez-Berestein, G; Sood, AK; Mendell, JT; Wan, YH",431.0,"[Krzeszinski, Jing Y.; Wei, Wei; HoangDinh Huynh; Jin, Zixue; Wang, Xunde; Wan, Yihong] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Pharmacol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Chang, Tsung-Cheng; Mendell, Joshua T.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Mol Biol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Xie, Xian-Jin; Mendell, Joshua T.; Wan, Yihong] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Simmons Canc Ctr, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Xie, Xian-Jin] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Clin Sci, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [He, Lin] Univ Calif Berkeley, Mol & Cell Biol Dept, Div Cellular & Dev Biol, Berkeley, CA 94705 USA; [Mangala, Lingegowda S.; Sood, Anil K.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Gynecol Oncol & Reprod Med, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Mangala, Lingegowda S.; Lopez-Berestein, Gabriel; Sood, Anil K.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Ctr RNA Interference & Noncoding RNA, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Lopez-Berestein, Gabriel] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Expt Therapeut, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Sood, Anil K.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Canc Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13375,Article,1476-4687,yihong.wan@utsouthwestern.edu,U460,"CPRIT [RP130145, R1008]; DOD [BC122877]; National Institutes of Health [R01 DK089113, R01 CA120185, P01 CA134292, U54 CA151668, UH2 TR000943, R01 CA139067]; Welch Foundation [I-1751]; University of Texas Southwestern Endowed Scholar Startup Fund; Harold C.

Removing Archaeopteryx from the base of Avialae to nest within Deinonychosauria implies that typical bird flight, powered by the forelimbs only, either evolved at least twice, or was subsequently lost or modified in some deinonychosaurians(3,5).

It represents an essential component of plant cell walls but is also found in algae and bacteria. In bacteria, cellulose production frequently correlates with the formation of biofilms, a sessile, multicellular growth form. Cellulose synthesis and transport across the inner bacterial membrane is mediated by a complex of the membrane-integrated catalytic BcsA subunit and the membrane-anchored, periplasmic BcsB protein. Here we present the crystal structure of a complex of BcsA and BcsB from Rhodobacter sphaeroides containing a translocating polysaccharide. The structure of the BcsA-BcsB translocation intermediate reveals the architecture of the cellulose synthase, demonstrates how BcsA forms a cellulose-conducting channel, and suggests a model for the coupling of cellulose synthesis and translocation in which the nascent polysaccharide is extended by one glucose molecule at a time.","Morgan, Jacob L.

42,103,140.0,"Measured rates of river incision into bedrock are commonly interpreted as proxies for rates of rock uplift (see refs 1 and 2, for example) and indices of the strength of climatic forcing of erosion over time (see refs 3 and 4, for example). This approach implicitly assumes that river incision rates are in equilibrium with external forcings over a wide range of timescales. Here we directly test this assumption by examining the temporal scaling of bedrock river incision from 155 independent measurements of river incision compiled from 14 sites. Of these sites, 11 exhibit a negative power-law dependence of bedrock river incision rate on measurement interval, a relationship that is apparent over timescales of 10(4)-10(7) years and is independent of tectonic and geomorphic setting. Thus, like rates of sediment accumulation(5), rates of river incision into bedrock exhibit non-steady-state behaviour even over very long measurement intervals. Non-steady-state behaviour can be explained by episodic hiatuses in river incision triggered by alluvial deposition, if such hiatuses have a heavy-tailed length distribution(6). Regardless of its cause, the dependence of incision rate on measurement interval complicates efforts to infer tectonic or climatic forcing from changes in rates of river incision over time or from comparison of rates computed over different timescales.","Finnegan, Noah J.; Schumer, Rina; Finnegan, Seth","Finnegan, NJ; Schumer, R; Finnegan, S",391.0,"[Finnegan, Noah J.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Schumer, Rina] Desert Res Inst, Div Hydrol Sci, Reno, NV 89512 USA; [Finnegan, Seth] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12913,Article,1476-4687,nfinnega@ucsc.edu,+,National Science Foundation [EAR-1049889],"This study was supported in part by the National Science Foundation (EAR-1049889).

Its atmosphere, mostly composed of carbon dioxide, has a surface temperature and pressure far higher than those of Earth. Only traces of water are found, although it is likely that there was much more present in the past, possibly forming Earth-like oceans. Here we discuss how the first year of observations by Venus Express brings into focus the evolutionary paths by which the climates of two similar planets diverged from common beginnings to such extremes.

44,96,402.0,"Future quantum communication will rely on the integration of single-photon sources, quantum memories and systems with strong single-photon nonlinearities(1). Two key parameters are crucial for the single-photon source: a high photon flux with a very small bandwidth, and a spectral match to other components of the system. Atoms or ions may act as single-photon sources-owing to their narrow-band emission and their intrinsic spectral match to other atomic systems-and can serve as quantum nonlinear elements. Unfortunately, their emission rates are still limited, even for highly efficient cavity designs(2). Single solid-state emitters such as single organic dye molecules are significantly brighter(3) and allow for narrowband photons(4); they have shown potential in a variety of quantum optical experiments(5,6) but have yet to be interfaced with other components such as stationary memory qubits. Here we describe the optical interaction between Fourier-limited photons from a single organic molecule and atomic alkali vapours, which can constitute an efficient quantum memory. Single-photon emission rates reach up to several hundred thousand counts per second and show a high spectral brightness of 30,000 detectable photons per second per megahertz of bandwidth. The molecular emission is robust and we demonstrate perfect tuning to the spectral transitions of the sodium D line and efficient filtering, even for emitters at ambient conditions. In addition, we achieve storage of molecular photons originating from a single dibenzanthanthrene molecule in atomic sodium vapour. Given the large set of molecular emission lines matching to atomic transitions, our results enable the combination of almost ideal single-photon sources with various atomic vapours, such that experiments with giant single photon nonlinearities, mediated, for example, by Rydberg atoms(7,8), become feasible.","Siyushev, Petr; Stein, Guilherme; Wrachtrup, Joeg; Gerhardt, Ilja","Siyushev, P; Stein, G; Wrachtrup, JR; Gerhardt, I",66.0,"[Siyushev, Petr; Stein, Guilherme; Wrachtrup, Joeg; Gerhardt, Ilja] Univ Stuttgart, Inst Phys 3, Stuttgart Res Ctr Photon Engn SCoPE, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany; [Siyushev, Petr; Stein, Guilherme; Wrachtrup, Joeg; Gerhardt, Ilja] Ctr Integrated Quantum Sci & Technol IQST, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany; [Wrachtrup, Joeg; Gerhardt, Ilja] Max Planck Inst Solid State Res, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13191,Article,1476-4687,i.gerhardt@fkf.mpg.de,+,Max Planck Society; BMBF; EU,"We thank W.

45,31,279.0,"Lysosomes are the stomachs of the cell - terminal organelles on the endocytic pathway where internalized macromolecules are degraded. Containing a wide range of hydrolytic enzymes, lysosomes depend on maintaining acidic luminal pH values for efficient function. Although acidification is mediated by a V- type proton ATPase, a parallel anion pathway is essential to allow bulk proton transport(1,2). The molecular identity of this anion transporter remains unknown. Recent results of knockout experiments raise the possibility that ClC- 7, a member of the CLC family of anion channels and transporters, is a contributor to this pathway in an osteoclast lysosome- like compartment, with loss of ClC- 7 function causing osteopetrosis(3). Several mammalian members of the CLC family have been characterized in detail; some ( including ClC- 0, ClC- 1 and ClC- 2) function as Cl(-) -conducting ion channels(4), whereas others act as Cl(-)/H(+) antiporters ( ClC- 4 and ClC-5) (5,6). However, previous attempts at heterologous expression of ClC- 7 have failed to yield evidence of functional protein, so it is unclear whether ClC- 7 has an important function in lysosomal biology, and also whether this protein functions as a Cl(-) channel, a Cl(-)/H(+) antiporter, or as something else entirely. Here we directly demonstrate an anion transport pathway in lysosomes that has the defining characteristics of a CLC Cl(-)/H(+) antiporter and show that this transporter is the predominant route for Cl(-) through the lysosomal membrane. Furthermore, knockdown of ClC- 7 expression by short interfering RNA can essentially ablate this lysosomal Cl(-)/H(+) antiport activity and can strongly diminish the ability of lysosomes to acidify in vivo, demonstrating that ClC- 7 is a Cl(-)/H(+) antiporter, that it constitutes the major Cl(-) permeability of lysosomes, and that it is important in lysosomal acidification.","Graves, Austin R.; Curran, Patricia K.; Smith, Carolyn L.; Mindell, Joseph A.","Graves, AR; Curran, PK; Smith, CL; Mindell, JA",788.0,"[Graves, Austin R.; Curran, Patricia K.; Mindell, Joseph A.] Natl Inst Neurol Disorders & Stroke, Membrane Transport Biophys Unit, Porter Neurosci Res Ctr, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Smith, Carolyn L.] Natl Inst Neurol Disorders & Stroke, Light Microscopy Facil, Porter Neurosci Res Ctr, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06907,Article,,mindellj@ninds.nih.gov,792,Intramural NIH HHS,,308UK,,,OSTEOPETROSIS TYPE-II; FUNCTIONAL RECONSTITUTION; TORPEDO-CALIFORNICA; PROTON PUMP; CHANNEL; PROTEINS; MUTATION; DISEASE; LEADS,7196.0,NATURE,Nature,English,22.0,No,"Mindell, Joseph/0000-0002-6952-8247","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",5-Jun,5.0,LONDON,18449189.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,"Mindell, Joseph/P-4461-2017","Mindell, JA (reprint author), Natl Inst Neurol Disorders & Stroke, Membrane Transport Biophys Unit, Porter Neurosci Res Ctr, NIH, 35 Convent Dr,Bldg 35,MSC 3701, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,171.0,The Cl(-)/H(+) antiporter ClC-7 is the primary chloride permeation pathway in lysosomes,3.0,15.0,WOS:000256415300045,279.0,453,Multidisciplinary Sciences,181,joseph a.,mindell,2978.0,3,male,1.0,fCKd4ikAAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",4477384,1,4477384,1,Neognathae,Neognathae,0,0
46,11,73.0,"Ecological interactions are crucial to understanding both the ecology and the evolution of organisms(1,2). Because the phenotypic traits regulating species interactions are largely a legacy of their ancestors, it is widely assumed that ecological interactions are phylogenetically conserved, with closely related species interacting with similar partners(2). However, the existing empirical evidence is inadequate to appropriately evaluate the hypothesis of phylogenetic conservatism in ecological interactions, because it is both ecologically and taxonomically biased. In fact, most studies on the evolution of ecological interactions have focused on specialized organisms, such as some parasites or insect herbivores(3-7), belonging to a limited subset of the overall tree of life. Here we study the evolution of host use in a large and diverse group of interactions comprising both specialist and generalist acellular, unicellular and multicellular organisms. We show that, as previously found for specialized interactions, generalized interactions can be evolutionarily conserved. Significant phylogenetic conservatism of interaction patterns was equally likely to occur in symbiotic and non-symbiotic interactions, as well as in mutualistic and antagonistic interactions. Host-use differentiation among species was higher in phylogenetically conserved clades, irrespective of their generalization degree and taxonomic position within the tree of life. Our findings strongly suggest a shared pattern in the organization of biological systems through evolutionary time, mediated by marked conservatism of ecological interactions among taxa.","Gomez, Jose M.; Verdu, Miguel; Perfectti, Francisco","Gomez, JM; Verdu, M; Perfectti, F",918.0,"[Gomez, Jose M.] Univ Granada, Dept Ecol, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Verdu, Miguel] Univ Valencia Generalitat Valenciana, CSIC, Ctr Invest Desertificac, E-46470 Valencia, Spain; [Perfectti, Francisco] Univ Granada, Dept Genet, E-18071 Granada, Spain",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09113,Article,,jmgreyes@ugr.es,U6,Spanish Ministry of Science; Junta de Andalucia,"We thank J.

47,104,141.0,"River systems connect the terrestrial biosphere, the atmosphere and the ocean in the global carbon cycle(1). A recent estimate suggests that up to 3 petagrams of carbon per year could be emitted as carbon dioxide (CO2) from global inland waters, offsetting the carbon uptake by terrestrial ecosystems(2). It is generally assumed that inland waters emit carbon that has been previously fixed upstream by land plant photosynthesis, then transferred to soils, and subsequently transported downstream in run-off. But at the scale of entire drainage basins, the lateral carbon fluxes carried by small rivers upstream do not account for all of the CO2 emitted from inundated areas downstream(3,4). Three-quarters of the world's flooded land consists of temporary wetlands(5), but the contribution of these productive ecosystems(6) to the inland water carbon budget has been largely overlooked. Here we show that wetlands pump large amounts of atmospheric CO2 into river waters in the floodplains of the central Amazon. Flooded forests and floating vegetation export large amounts of carbon to river waters and the dissolved CO2 can be transported dozens to hundreds of kilometres downstream before being emitted. We estimate that Amazonian wetlands export half of their gross primary production to river waters as dissolved CO2 and organic carbon, compared with only a few per cent of gross primary production exported in upland (not flooded) ecosystems(1,7). Moreover, we suggest that wetland carbon export is potentially large enough to account for at least the 0.21 petagrams of carbon emitted per year as CO2 from the central Amazon River and its floodplains(8). Global carbon budgets should explicitly address temporary or vegetated flooded areas, because these ecosystems combine high aerial primary production with large, fast carbon export, potentially supporting a substantial fraction of CO2 evasion from inland waters.","Abril, Gwenael; Martinez, Jean-Michel; Artigas, L.

Our findings provide, to our knowledge, the first insight into the binding mode of a peptide agonist to a GPCR and may support the development of non-peptide ligands that could be useful in the treatment of neurological disorders, cancer and obesity.","White, Jim F.; Noinaj, Nicholas; Shibata, Yoko; Love, James; Kloss, Brian; Xu, Feng; Gvozdenovic-Jeremic, Jelena; Shah, Priyanka; Shiloach, Joseph; Tate, Christopher G.; Grisshammer, Reinhard","White, JF; Noinaj, N; Shibata, Y; Love, J; Kloss, B; Xu, F; Gvozdenovic-Jeremic, J; Shah, P; Shiloach, J; Tate, CG; Grisshammer, R",508.0,"[White, Jim F.; Xu, Feng; Gvozdenovic-Jeremic, Jelena; Shah, Priyanka; Grisshammer, Reinhard] Natl Inst Neurol Disorders & Stroke, Membrane Prot Struct Funct Unit, NIH, US Dept HHS, Rockville, MD 20852 USA; [Noinaj, Nicholas] NIDDKD, Mol Biol Lab, NIH, US Dept HHS, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Shibata, Yoko; Tate, Christopher G.] MRC, Mol Biol Lab, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England; [Love, James; Kloss, Brian] New York Struct Biol Ctr, New York Consortium Membrane Prot Struct, Prot Prod Facil, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Shiloach, Joseph] NIDDKD, Biotechnol Core Lab, NIH, US Dept HHS, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11558,Article,,rkgriss@helix.nih.gov,+,"National Institutes of Health (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke); National Institutes of Health (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases); Pfizer Global Research and Development; MRCT Development Gap Fund; UK Medical Research Council [MRC U105197215]; National Institutes of Health [U54GM075026]; NIH Roadmap grant [P50 GM073197]; US Department of Energy, Basic Energy Sciences, Office of Science [DE-AC02-06CH11357]","This research was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institutes of Health (J.F.W., J.G.-J., P.S. and R.G.: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke; N.N. and J.S.: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) and a joint grant from Pfizer Global Research and Development and the MRCT Development Gap Fund in addition to core funding from the UK Medical Research Council MRC U105197215 (Y.S., C.G.T.).

49,128,111.0,"The existence of gaseous giant planets whose orbits lie close to their host stars ('hot Jupiters') can largely be accounted for by planetary migration associated with viscous evolution of proto-planetary nebulae(1). Recently, observations of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect(2) during planetary transits have revealed that a considerable fraction of hot Jupiters are on orbits that are misaligned with respect to the spin axes of their host stars(3). This observation has cast doubt on the importance of disk-driven migration as a mechanism for producing hot Jupiters. Here I show that misaligned orbits can be a natural consequence of disk migration in binary systems whose orbital plane is uncorrelated with the spin axes of the individual stars(4-6). The gravitational torques arising from the dynamical evolution of idealized proto-planetary disks under perturbations from massive distant bodies act to misalign the orbital planes of the disks relative to the spin poles of their host stars. As a result, I suggest that in the absence of strong coupling between the angular momentum of the disk and that of the host star, or of sufficient dissipation that acts to realign the stellar spin axis and the planetary orbits, the fraction of planetary systems (including systems of 'hot Neptunes' and 'super-Earths') whose angular momentum vectors are misaligned with respect to their host stars will be commensurate with the rate of primordial stellar multiplicity.","Batygin, Konstantin","Batygin, K",418.0,"[Batygin, Konstantin] CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Batygin, Konstantin] Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Inst Theory & Computat, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11560,Article,,kbatygin@gps.caltech.edu,420,,,036MY,,,MULTIPLE-STAR-FORMATION; HOT JUPITERS; TAURUS-AURIGA; DYNAMICS; SYSTEMS; BINARY; ENVIRONMENT; SCATTERING; MIGRATION; EVOLUTION,7424.0,NATURE,Nature,English,29.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",15-Nov,3.0,LONDON,23151584.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2012.0,,"Batygin, K (reprint author), CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,102.0,A primordial origin for misalignments between stellar spin axes and planetary orbits,0.0,7.0,WOS:000311031600040,111.0,491,Multidisciplinary Sciences,102,konstantin,batygin,2083.0,66,male,1.0,04fDAYsAAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",49177410,1,49177410,1,Konstantin Batygin,Konstantin Batygin,1,1
50,87,154.0,"Neurotransmitter-gated ion channels of the Cys-loop receptor family mediate fast neurotransmission throughout the nervous system. The molecular processes of neurotransmitter binding, subsequent opening of the ion channel and ion permeation remain poorly understood. Here we present the X-ray structure of a mammalian Cys-loop receptor, the mouse serotonin 5-HT3 receptor, at 3.5 angstrom resolution. The structure of the proteolysed receptor, made up of two fragments and comprising part of the intracellular domain, was determined in complex with stabilizing nanobodies. The extracellular domain reveals the detailed anatomy of the neurotransmitter binding site capped by a nanobody. The membrane domain delimits an aqueous pore with a 4.6 angstrom constriction. In the intracellular domain, a bundle of five intracellular helices creates a closed vestibule where lateral portals are obstructed by loops. This 5-HT3 receptor structure, revealing part of the intracellular domain, expands the structural basis for understanding the operating mechanism of mammalian Cys-loop receptors.","Hassaine, Gherici; Deluz, Cedric; Grasso, Luigino; Wyss, Romain; Tol, Menno B.; Hovius, Ruud; Graff, Alexandra; Stahlberg, Henning; Tomizaki, Takashi; Desmyter, Aline; Moreau, Christophe; Li, Xiao-Dan; Poitevin, Frederic; Vogel, Horst; Nury, Hugues","Hassaine, G; Deluz, C; Grasso, L; Wyss, R; Tol, MB; Hovius, R; Graff, A; Stahlberg, H; Tomizaki, T; Desmyter, A; Moreau, C; Li, XD; Poitevin, F; Vogel, H; Nury, H",276.0,"[Hassaine, Gherici; Deluz, Cedric; Grasso, Luigino; Wyss, Romain; Tol, Menno B.; Hovius, Ruud; Vogel, Horst; Nury, Hugues] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lab Phys Chem Polymers & Membranes, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Graff, Alexandra; Stahlberg, Henning] Univ Basel, Biozentrum, Ctr Cellular Imaging & NanoAnalyt, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland; [Tomizaki, Takashi] Paul Scherrer Inst, Swiss Light Source, CH-5234 Villigen, Switzerland; [Desmyter, Aline] CNRS, UMR 7257, F-13288 Marseille, France; [Desmyter, Aline] Univ Aix Marseille, F-13288 Marseille, France; [Moreau, Christophe; Nury, Hugues] Univ Grenoble Alpes, IBS, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Moreau, Christophe; Nury, Hugues] CNRS, IBS, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Moreau, Christophe; Nury, Hugues] CEA, DSV, IBS, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Li, Xiao-Dan] Paul Scherrer Inst, Lab Biomol Res, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland; [Poitevin, Frederic] Inst Pasteur, CNRS, UMR3528, Unite Dynam Struct Macromol, F-75015 Paris, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13552,Article,1476-4687,horst.vogel@epfl.ch; hugues.nury@ibs.fr,+,Swiss National Science Foundation [31003A-133141]; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; European Community [211800]; Human Frontier Science Program; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (VenomPicoScreen project) [ANR-11-RPIB-022-04],"Research in the laboratory of H.

51,149,445.0,"Flying insects oscillate their wings at high frequencies of up to 1,000 Hz(1,2) and produce large mechanical forces of 80 W per kilogram of muscle(3). They utilize a pair of perpendicularly oriented indirect flight muscles that contain fibrillar, stretch-activated myofibres. In contrast, all other, more slowly contracting, insect body muscles have a tubular muscle morphology(4). Here we identify the transcription factor Spalt major (Salm) as a master regulator of fibrillar flight muscle fate in Drosophila. salm is necessary and sufficient to induce fibrillar muscle fate. salm switches the entire transcriptional program from tubular to fibrillar fate by regulating the expression and splicing of key sarcomeric components specific to each muscle type. Spalt function is conserved in insects evolutionarily separated by 280 million years. We propose that Spalt proteins switch myofibres from tubular to fibrillar fate during development, a function potentially conserved in the vertebrate heart-a stretch-activated muscle sharing features with insect flight muscle.","Schoenbauer, Cornelia; Distler, Jutta; Jaehrling, Nina; Radolf, Martin; Dodt, Hans-Ulrich; Frasch, Manfred; Schnorrer, Frank","Schonbauer, C; Distler, J; Jahrling, N; Radolf, M; Dodt, HU; Frasch, M; Schnorrer, F",406.0,"[Schoenbauer, Cornelia; Schnorrer, Frank] Max Planck Inst Biochem, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany; [Distler, Jutta; Frasch, Manfred] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Dept Biol, Dev Biol Div, D-91058 Erlangen, Germany; [Jaehrling, Nina; Dodt, Hans-Ulrich] Vienna Univ Technol, FKE, Dept Bioelect, A-1040 Vienna, Austria; [Jaehrling, Nina; Dodt, Hans-Ulrich] Med Univ Vienna, Ctr Brain Res, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Radolf, Martin] IMP, A-1030 Vienna, Austria",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10559,Article,,schnorrer@biochem.mpg.de,U160,Max-Planck-Society; Human Frontier Science Programme; Austrian Academy of Sciences; DFG,"We thank M.

52,65,103.0,"The mechanical properties of many materials are based on the macroscopic arrangement and orientation of their nanostructure. This nanostructure can be ordered over a range of length scales. In biology, the principle of hierarchical ordering is often used to maximize functionality, such as strength and robustness of the material, while minimizing weight and energy cost. Methods for nanoscale imaging provide direct visual access to the ultrastructure (nanoscale structure that is too small to be imaged using light microscopy), but the field of view is limited and does not easily allow a full correlative study of changes in the ultrastructure over a macroscopic sample. Other methods of probing ultrastructure ordering, such as small-angle scattering of X-rays or neutrons, can be applied to macroscopic samples; however, these scattering methods remain constrained to two-dimensional specimens(1-4) or to isotropically oriented ultrastructures(5-7). These constraints limit the use of these methods for studying nanostructures with more complex orientation patterns, which are abundant in nature and materials science. Here, we introduce an imaging method that combines small-angle scattering with tensor tomography to probe nanoscale structures in three-dimensional macroscopic samples in a non-destructive way. We demonstrate the method by measuring the main orientation and the degree of orientation of nanoscale mineralized collagen fibrils in a human trabecula bone sample with a spatial resolution of 25 micrometres. Symmetries within the sample, such as the cylindrical symmetry commonly observed for mineralized collagen fibrils in bone(8-10), allow for tractable sampling requirements and numerical efficiency. Small-angle scattering tensor tomography is applicable to both biological and materials science specimens, and may be useful for understanding and characterizing smart or bio-inspired materials. Moreover, because the method is non-destructive, it is appropriate for in situ measurements and allows, for example, the role of ultrastructure in the mechanical response of a biological tissue or manufactured material to be studied.","Liebi, Marianne; Georgiadis, Marios; Menzel, Andreas; Schneider, Philipp; Kohlbrecher, Joachim; Bunk, Oliver; Guizar-Sicairos, Manuel","Liebi, M; Georgiadis, M; Menzel, A; Schneider, P; Kohlbrecher, J; Bunk, O; Guizar-Sicairos, M",349.0,"[Liebi, Marianne; Menzel, Andreas; Kohlbrecher, Joachim; Bunk, Oliver; Guizar-Sicairos, Manuel] Paul Scherrer Inst, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland; [Georgiadis, Marios] ETH, Inst Biomech, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Schneider, Philipp] Univ Southampton, Bioengn Sci Res Grp, Fac Engn & Environm, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature16056,Article,1476-4687,marianne.liebi@psi.ch; manuel.guizar-sicairos@psi.ch,+,ETH Research Grant [ETH-39 11-1],"We thank M.

53,95,397.0,"Sensory proteins must relay structural signals from the sensory site over large distances to regulatory output domains. Phytochromes are a major family of red-light-sensing kinases that control diverse cellular functions in plants, bacteria and fungi(1-9). Bacterial phytochromes consist of a photosensory core and a carboxy-terminal regulatory domain(10,11). Structures of photosensory cores are reported in the resting state(12-18) and conformational responses to light activation have been proposed in the vicinity of the chromophore(19-23). However, the structure of the signalling state and the mechanism of downstream signal relay through the photosensory core remain elusive. Here we report crystal and solution structures of the resting and activated states of the photosensory core of the bacteriophytochrome from Deinococcus radiodurans. The structures show an open and closed form of the dimeric protein for the activated and resting states, respectively. This nanometre-scale rearrangement is controlled by refolding of an evolutionarily conserved 'tongue', which is in contact with the chromophore. The findings reveal an unusual mechanism in which atomic-scale conformational changes around the chromophore are first amplified into ana angstrom-scale distance change in the tongue, and further grow into a nanometre-scale conformational signal. The structural mechanism is a blueprint for understanding how phytochromes connect to the cellular signalling network.","Takala, Heikki; Bjorling, Alexander; Berntsson, Oskar; Lehtivuori, Heli; Niebling, Stephan; Hoernke, Maria; Kosheleva, Irina; Henning, Robert; Menzel, Andreas; Ihalainen, Janne A.; Westenhoff, Sebastian","Takala, H; Bjorling, A; Berntsson, O; Lehtivuori, H; Niebling, S; Hoernke, M; Kosheleva, I; Henning, R; Menzel, A; Ihalainen, JA; Westenhoff, S",245.0,"[Takala, Heikki; Lehtivuori, Heli; Ihalainen, Janne A.] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Nanosci Ctr, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland; [Takala, Heikki; Bjorling, Alexander; Berntsson, Oskar; Niebling, Stephan; Hoernke, Maria; Westenhoff, Sebastian] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Chem & Mol Biol, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Kosheleva, Irina; Henning, Robert] Univ Chicago, Ctr Adv Radiat Sources, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Menzel, Andreas] Paul Scherrer Inst, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13310,Article,1476-4687,janne.ihalainen@jyu.fi; westenho@chem.gu.se,+,"European Community [312284 CALIPSO]; National Institutes of Health, National Institute of General Medical Sciences [1R24GM111072]; Foundation of Strategic Research, Sweden; Swedish Research Council [279944]; European Research Council [279944]; Finnish Academy [138063]; Finnish Cultural Foundation [0131067]","We acknowledge beamline access at BM29 and ID23-1 at the ESRF, cSAXS at the Swiss Light Source (funded by the European Community's FP7 grant agreement no. 312284 CALIPSO), and BioCARS at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory (supported by National Institutes of Health, National Institute of General Medical Sciences grant 1R24GM111072 and in part through collaboration with P.

54,57,283.0,"The inferior temporal cortex ( IT) of primates is thought to be the final visual area in the ventral stream of cortical areas responsible for object recognition(1,2). Consistent with this hypothesis, single IT neurons respond selectively to highly complex visual stimuli such as faces(3-6). However, a direct causal link between the activity of face- selective neurons and face perception has not been demonstrated. In the present study of macaque monkeys, we artificially activated small clusters of IT neurons by means of electrical microstimulation while the monkeys performed a categorization task, judging whether noisy visual images belonged to ' face ' or ' non- face' categories. Here we show that microstimulation of face-selective sites, but not other sites, strongly biased the monkeys' decisions towards the face category. The magnitude of the effect depended upon the degree of face selectivity of the stimulation site, the size of the stimulated cluster of face- selective neurons, and the exact timing of microstimulation. Our results establish a causal relationship between the activity of face- selective neurons and face perception.","Afraz, Seyed-Reza; Kiani, Roozbeh; Esteky, Hossein","Afraz, SR; Kiani, R; Esteky, H",692.0,"Inst Studies Theoret Phys & Math, Sch Cognit Sci, Tehran 19395, Iran; Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Res Ctr Brain & Cognit Sci, Tehran 19385, Iran; Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Neurosci Res Ctr, Tehran 19385, Iran",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature04982,Article,,esteky@ipm.ir,695,,,071UU,,,TEMPORAL VISUAL-CORTEX; PYRAMIDAL TRACT CELLS; INTRACORTICAL MICROSTIMULATION; ELECTRICAL MICROSTIMULATION; SINGLE NEURONS; AREA MT; MACAQUE; RESPONSES; DIRECTION; MONKEY,7103.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",10-Aug,4.0,LONDON,16878143.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,,"Esteky, H (reprint author), Inst Studies Theoret Phys & Math, Sch Cognit Sci, Tehran 19395, Iran.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,143.0,Microstimulation of inferotemporal cortex influences face categorization,0.0,9.0,WOS:000239630200047,283.0,442,Multidisciplinary Sciences,146,hossein,esteky,1691.0,41,male,0.98,vDnQD4sAAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
55,77,427.0,"The molecularly defined clade Ecdysozoa(1) comprises the panarthropods (Euarthropoda, Onychophora and Tardigrada) and the cycloneuralian worms (Nematoda, Nematomorpha, Priapulida, Loricifera and Kinorhyncha). These disparate phyla are united by their means of moulting, but otherwise share few morphological characters-none of which has a meaningful fossilization potential. As such, the early evolutionary history of the group as a whole is largely uncharted. Here we redescribe the 508-million-year-old stem-group onychophoran Hallucigenia sparsa(2-6) from the mid-Cambrian Burgess Shale. We document an elongate head with a pair of simple eyes, a terminal buccal chamber containing a radial array of sclerotized elements, and a differentiated foregut that is lined with acicular teeth. The radial elements and pharyngeal teeth resemble the sclerotized circumoral elements and pharyngeal teeth expressed in tardigrades(7-9), stem-group euarthropods(10-12) and cycloneuralian worms(13). Phylogenetic results indicate that equivalent structures characterized the ancestral panarthropod and, seemingly, the ancestral ecdysozoan, demonstrating the deep homology of panarthropod and cycloneuralian mouthparts, and providing an anatomical synapomorphy for the ecdysozoan supergroup.","Smith, Martin R.; Caron, Jean-Bernard","Smith, MR; Caron, JB",75.0,"[Smith, Martin R.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Earth Sci, Cambridge CB2 3EQ, England; [Caron, Jean-Bernard] Royal Ontario Museum, Dept Nat Hist, Palaeobiol Sect, Toronto, ON M5S 2C6, Canada; [Caron, Jean-Bernard] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada; [Caron, Jean-Bernard] Univ Toronto, Dept Earth Sci, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14573,Article,1476-4687,ms609@cam.ac.uk,+,"Willi Hennig Society; Clare College, Cambridge; NSERC [341944]; ROM DMV Acquisition and Research Fund; Endowment Fund; ROM Burgess Shale project [60]","We thank D.

56,6,301.0,"Two forms of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) ensure the selective silencing of female sex chromosomes during mouse embryogenesis. Imprinted XCI begins with the detection of Xist RNA expression on the paternal X chromosome (Xp) at about the four-cell stage of embryonic development. In the embryonic tissues of the inner cell mass, a random form of XCI occurs in blastocysts that inactivates either Xp or the maternal X chromosome (Xm)(1,2). Both forms of XCI require the non-coding Xist RNA that coats the inactive X chromosome from which it is expressed. Xist has crucial functions in the silencing of X-linked genes, including Rnf12 (refs 3, 4) encoding the ubiquitin ligase RLIM (RING finger LIM-domain-interacting protein). Here we show, by targeting a conditional knockout of Rnf12 to oocytes where RLIM accumulates to high levels, that the maternal transmission of the mutant X chromosome (Delta m) leads to lethality in female embryos as a result of defective imprinted XCI. We provide evidence that in Delta m female embryos the initial formation of Xist clouds and Xp silencing are inhibited. In contrast, embryonic stem cells lacking RLIM are able to form Xist clouds and silence at least some X-linked genes during random XCI. These results assign crucial functions to the maternal deposit of Rnf12/RLIM for the initiation of imprinted XCI.","Shin, JongDae; Bossenz, Michael; Chung, Young; Ma, Hong; Byron, Meg; Taniguchi-Ishigaki, Naoko; Zhu, Xiaochun; Jiao, Baowei; Hall, Lisa L.; Green, Michael R.; Jones, Stephen N.; Hermans-Borgmeyer, Irm; Lawrence, Jeanne B.; Bach, Ingolf","Shin, J; Bossenz, M; Chung, Y; Ma, H; Byron, M; Taniguchi-Ishigaki, N; Zhu, XC; Jiao, BW; Hall, LL; Green, MR; Jones, SN; Hermans-Borgmeyer, I; Lawrence, JB; Bach, I",977.0,"[Shin, JongDae; Ma, Hong; Taniguchi-Ishigaki, Naoko; Zhu, Xiaochun; Jiao, Baowei; Green, Michael R.; Bach, Ingolf] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Program Gene Funct & Express, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Green, Michael R.; Bach, Ingolf] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Program Mol Med, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Zhu, Xiaochun; Green, Michael R.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Byron, Meg; Hall, Lisa L.; Jones, Stephen N.; Lawrence, Jeanne B.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Bossenz, Michael; Hermans-Borgmeyer, Irm] Univ Hamburg, Ctr Mol Neurobiol, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany; [Chung, Young] Stem Cell & Regenerat Med Int Inc, Marlborough, MA 01752 USA; [Chung, Young] CHA Univ, Sch Med, Seoul 135081, South Korea",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09457,Article,,ingolf.bach@umassmed.edu,U157,"National Institutes of Health (National Cancer Institute) [R01CA131158]; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases [5 P30 DK32520, GM053234]","We thank V.

57,22,484.0,"A common hallmark of human cancers is the overexpression of telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein complex that is responsible for maintaining the length and integrity of chromosome ends. Telomere length deregulation and telomerase activation is an early, and perhaps necessary, step in cancer cell evolution. Here we present the high- resolution structure of the Tribolium castaneum catalytic subunit of telomerase, TERT. The protein consists of three highly conserved domains, organized into a ring- like structure that shares common features with retroviral reverse transcriptases, viral RNA polymerases and B- family DNA polymerases. Domain organization places motifs implicated in substrate binding and catalysis in the interior of the ring, which can accommodate seven to eight bases of double- stranded nucleic acid. Modelling of an RNA - DNA heteroduplex in the interior of this ring demonstrates a perfect fit between the protein and the nucleic acid substrate, and positions the 39- end of the DNA primer at the active site of the enzyme, providing evidence for the formation of an active telomerase elongation complex.","Gillis, Andrew J.; Schuller, Anthony P.; Skordalakes, Emmanuel","Gillis, AJ; Schuller, AP; Skordalakes, E",633.0,"[Gillis, Andrew J.; Schuller, Anthony P.; Skordalakes, Emmanuel] Wistar Inst Anat & Biol, Gene Express & Regulat Program, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07283,Article,,skorda@wistar.org,U36,Pennsylvania Department of Health; The Ellison Medical Foundation,We thank R.

58,73,353.0,"West Africa is currently witnessing the most extensive Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak so far recorded(1-3). Until now, there have been 27,013 reported cases and 11,134 deaths. The origin of the virus is thought to have been a zoonotic transmission from a bat to a two-year-old boy in December 2013 (ref. 2). From this index case the virus was spread by human-to-human contact throughout Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. However, the origin of the particular virus in each country and time of transmission is not known and currently relies on epidemiological analysis, which may be unreliable owing to the difficulties of obtaining patient information. Here we trace the genetic evolution of EBOV in the current outbreak that has resulted in multiple lineages. Deep sequencing of 179 patient samples processed by the European Mobile Laboratory, the first diagnostics unit to be deployed to the epicentre of the outbreak in Guinea, reveals an epidemiological and evolutionary history of the epidemic from March 2014 to January 2015. Analysis of EBOV genome evolution has also benefited from a similar sequencing effort of patient samples from Sierra Leone. Our results confirm that the EBOV from Guinea moved into Sierra Leone, most likely in April or early May. The viruses of the Guinea/Sierra Leone lineage mixed around June/July 2014. Viral sequences covering August, September and October 2014 indicate that this lineage evolved independently within Guinea. These data can be used in conjunction with epidemiological information to test retrospectively the effectiveness of control measures, and provides an unprecedented window into the evolution of an ongoing viral haemorrhagic fever outbreak.","Carroll, Miles W.; Matthews, David A.; Hiscox, Julian A.; Elmore, Michael J.; Pollakis, Georgios; Rambaut, Andrew; Hewson, Roger; Garcia-Dorival, Isabel; Bore, Joseph Akoi; Koundouno, Raymond; Abdellati, Said; Afrough, Babak; Aiyepada, John; Akhilomen, Patience; Asogun, Danny; Atkinson, Barry; Badusche, Marlis; Bah, Amadou; Bate, Simon; Baumann, Jan; Becker, Dirk; Becker-Ziaja, Beate; Bocquin, Anne; Borremans, Benny; Bosworth, Andrew; Boettcher, Jan Peter; Cannas, Angela; Carletti, Fabrizio; Castilletti, Concetta; Clark, Simon; Colavita, Francesca; Diederich, Sandra; Donatus, Adomeh; Duraffour, Sophie; Ehichioya, Deborah; Ellerbrok, Heinz; Fernandez-Garcia, Maria Dolores; Fizet, Alexandra; Fleischmann, Erna; Gryseels, Sophie; Hermelink, Antje; Hinzmann, Julia; Hopf-Guevara, Ute; Ighodalo, Yemisi; Jameson, Lisa; Kelterbaum, Anne; Kis, Zoltan; Kloth, Stefan; Kohl, Claudia; Korva, Misa; Kraus, Annette; Kuisma, Eeva; Kurth, Andreas; Liedigk, Britta; Logue, Christopher H.; Luedtke, Anja; Maes, Piet; McCowen, James; Mely, Stephane; Mertens, Marc; Meschi, Silvia; Meyer, Benjamin; Michel, Janine; Molkenthin, Peter; Munoz-Fontela, Cesar; Muth, Doreen; Newman, Edmund N.

59,153,126.0,"DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in repetitive sequences are a potent source of genomic instability, owing to the possibility of non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR). Repetitive sequences are especially at risk during meiosis, when numerous programmed DSBs are introduced into the genome to initiate meiotic recombination(1). In the repetitive ribosomal DNA (rDNA) array of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, meiotic DSB formation is prevented in part through Sir2-dependent heterochromatin formation(2,3). Here we show that the edges of the rDNA array are exceptionally susceptible to meiotic DSBs, revealing an inherent heterogeneity in the rDNA array. We find that this localized DSB susceptibility necessitates a border-specific protection system consisting of the meiotic ATPase Pch2 and the origin recognition complex subunit Orc1. Upon disruption of these factors, DSB formation and recombination increased specifically in the outermost rDNA repeats, leading to NAHR and rDNA instability. Notably, the Sir2-dependent heterochromatin of the rDNA itself was responsible for the induction of DSBs at the rDNA borders in pch2 Delta cells. Thus, although the activity of Sir2 globally prevents meiotic DSBs in the rDNA, it creates a highly permissive environment for DSB formation at the junctions between heterochromatin and euchromatin. Heterochromatinized repetitive DNA arrays are abundant in most eukaryotic genomes. Our data define the borders of such chromatin domains as distinct high-risk regions for meiotic NAHR, the protection of which may be a universal requirement to prevent meiotic genome rearrangements that are associated with genomic diseases and birth defects.","Vader, Gerben; Blitzblau, Hannah G.; Tame, Mihoko A.; Falk, Jill E.; Curtin, Lisa; Hochwagen, Andreas","Vader, G; Blitzblau, HG; Tame, MA; Falk, JE; Curtin, L; Hochwagen, A",115.0,"[Vader, Gerben; Blitzblau, Hannah G.; Tame, Mihoko A.; Falk, Jill E.; Curtin, Lisa; Hochwagen, Andreas] Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge Ctr 9, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Curtin, Lisa] Somerville High Sch, Somerville, MA 02143 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10331,Article,,andi@nyu.edu,U141,"NIH [GM088248]; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research [NWO Rubicon-825.08.009, NWO VENI-016.111.004]; HHMI [52005879]","We thank S.

60,140,201.0,"In 1961, Rolf Landauer argued that the erasure of information is a dissipative process(1). A minimal quantity of heat, proportional to the thermal energy and called the Landauer bound, is necessarily produced when a classical bit of information is deleted. A direct consequence of this logically irreversible transformation is that the entropy of the environment increases by a finite amount. Despite its fundamental importance for information theory and computer science(2-5), the erasure principle has not been verified experimentally so far, the main obstacle being the difficulty of doing single-particle experiments in the low-dissipation regime. Here we experimentally show the existence of the Landauer bound in a generic model of a one-bit memory. Using a system of a single colloidal particle trapped in a modulated double-well potential, we establish that the mean dissipated heat saturates at the Landauer bound in the limit of long erasure cycles. This result demonstrates the intimate link between information theory and thermodynamics. It further highlights the ultimate physical limit of irreversible computation.","Berut, Antoine; Arakelyan, Artak; Petrosyan, Artyom; Ciliberto, Sergio; Dillenschneider, Raoul; Lutz, Eric","Berut, A; Arakelyan, A; Petrosyan, A; Ciliberto, S; Dillenschneider, R; Lutz, E",187.0,"[Berut, Antoine; Arakelyan, Artak; Petrosyan, Artyom; Ciliberto, Sergio] Ecole Normale Super Lyon, Phys Lab, CNRS, UMR5672, F-69364 Lyon, France; [Dillenschneider, Raoul] Univ Kaiserslautern, Dept Phys, D-67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany; [Dillenschneider, Raoul] Univ Kaiserslautern, Res Ctr OPTIMAS, D-67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany; [Lutz, Eric] Univ Augsburg, Dept Phys, D-86135 Augsburg, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10872,Article,,eric.lutz@fu-berlin.de,U1500,"DFG [LU1382/1-1]; Cluster of Excellence Nanosystems Initiative Munich (NIM), DAAD; Research Center of the DFG [Transregio 49]","This work was supported by the Emmy Noether Program of the DFG (contract no.

61,165,77.0,"Phosphoinositides serve crucial roles in cell physiology, ranging from cell signalling to membrane traffic(1,2). Among the seven eukaryotic phosphoinositides the best studied species is phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P-2), which is concentrated at the plasma membrane where, among other functions, it is required for the nucleation of endocytic clathrin-coated pits(3-6). No phosphatidylinositol other than PI(4,5)P-2 has been implicated in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, whereas the subsequent endosomal stages of the endocytic pathway are dominated by phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphates(PI(3)P)(7). How phosphatidylinositol conversion from PI(4,5)P-2-positive endocytic intermediates to PI(3)P-containing endosomes is achieved is unclear. Here we show that formation of phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P-2) by class II phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase C2 alpha (PI(3) K C2 alpha) spatiotemporally controls clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Depletion of PI(3,4)P-2 or PI(3)K C2 alpha impairs the maturation of late-stage clathrin-coated pits before fission. Timed formation of PI(3,4)P-2 by PI(3)K C2 alpha is required for selective enrichment of the BAR domain protein SNX9 at late-stage endocytic intermediates. These findings provide a mechanistic framework for the role of PI(3,4)P-2 in endocytosis and unravel a novel discrete function of PI(3,4)P-2 in a central cell physiological process.","Posor, York; Eichhorn-Gruenig, Marielle; Puchkov, Dmytro; Schoeneberg, Johannes; Ullrich, Alexander; Lampe, Andre; Mueller, Rainer; Zarbakhsh, Sirus; Gulluni, Federico; Hirsch, Emilio; Krauss, Michael; Schultz, Carsten; Schmoranzer, Jan; Noe, Frank; Haucke, Volker","Posor, Y; Eichhorn-Gruenig, M; Puchkov, D; Schoneberg, J; Ullrich, A; Lampe, A; Muller, R; Zarbakhsh, S; Gulluni, F; Hirsch, E; Krauss, M; Schultz, C; Schmoranzer, J; Noe, F; Haucke, V",233.0,"[Posor, York; Eichhorn-Gruenig, Marielle; Puchkov, Dmytro; Lampe, Andre; Krauss, Michael; Schmoranzer, Jan; Haucke, Volker] Leibniz Inst Mol Pharmakol FMP, D-13125 Berlin, Germany; [Posor, York; Eichhorn-Gruenig, Marielle; Puchkov, Dmytro; Lampe, Andre; Krauss, Michael; Schmoranzer, Jan; Haucke, Volker] Free Univ Berlin, D-13125 Berlin, Germany; [Schoeneberg, Johannes; Ullrich, Alexander; Noe, Frank] Free Univ Berlin, DFG Res Ctr MATHEON, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Mueller, Rainer; Zarbakhsh, Sirus; Schultz, Carsten] European Mol Biol Lab, Cell Biol & Biophys Unit, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Gulluni, Federico; Hirsch, Emilio] Univ Turin, Ctr Mol Biotechnol, Dept Genet, I-10126 Turin, Italy; [Gulluni, Federico; Hirsch, Emilio] Univ Turin, Ctr Mol Biotechnol, Dept Biol, I-10126 Turin, Italy; [Gulluni, Federico; Hirsch, Emilio] Univ Turin, Ctr Mol Biotechnol, Dept Biochem, I-10126 Turin, Italy; [Haucke, Volker] Charite, NeuroCure Cluster Excellence, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12360,Article,,haucke@fmp-berlin.de,+,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB 740/C8, SFB 740/D7, SFB 958/A04, SFB 958/A07, SFB 958/Z02]","We thank E.

62,118,496.0,"Jets of highly energized plasma with relativistic velocities are associated with black holes ranging in mass from a few times that of the Sun to the billion-solar-mass black holes at the centres of galaxies(1). A popular but unconfirmed hypothesis to explain how the plasma is energized is the 'internal shock model', in which the relativistic flow is unsteady(2). Faster components in the jet catch up to and collide with slower ones, leading to internal shocks that accelerate particles and generate magnetic fields(3). This mechanism can explain the variable, high-energy emission from a diverse set of objects(4-7), with the best indirect evidence being the unseen fast relativistic flow inferred to energize slower components in X-ray binary jets(8,9). Mapping of the kinematic profiles in resolved jets has revealed precessing and helical patterns in X-ray binaries(10,11), apparent superluminal motions(12,13), and the ejection of knots (bright components) from standing shocks in the jets of active galaxies(14,15). Observations revealing the structure and evolution of an internal shock in action have, however, remained elusive, hindering measurement of the physical parameters and ultimate efficiency of the mechanism. Here we report observations of a collision between two knots in the jet of nearby radio galaxy 3C 264. Abright knot with an apparent speed of (7.0 +/- 0.8)c, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum, is in the incipient stages of a collision with a slower-moving knot of speed (1.8 +/- 0.5)c just downstream, resulting in brightening of both knots-as seen in the most recent epoch of imaging.","Meyer, Eileen T.; Georganopoulos, Markos; Sparks, William B.; Perlman, Eric; van der Marel, Roeland P.; Anderson, Jay; Sohn, Sangmo Tony; Biretta, John; Norman, Colin; Chiaberge, Marco","Meyer, ET; Georganopoulos, M; Sparks, WB; Perlman, E; van der Marel, RP; Anderson, J; Sohn, ST; Biretta, J; Norman, C; Chiaberge, M",495.0,"[Meyer, Eileen T.; Sparks, William B.; van der Marel, Roeland P.; Anderson, Jay; Biretta, John; Norman, Colin; Chiaberge, Marco] Space Telescope Sci Inst, 3700 San Martin Dr, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Meyer, Eileen T.; Georganopoulos, Markos] Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Baltimore, MD 21250 USA; [Georganopoulos, Markos] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Perlman, Eric] Florida Inst Technol, Melbourne, FL 32901 USA; [Sohn, Sangmo Tony; Norman, Colin; Chiaberge, Marco] Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Chiaberge, Marco] Ist Radio Astron, Ist Nazl Astrofis, I-40129 Bologna, Italy",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14481,Article,1476-4687,eileen.meyer@gmail.com,+,HST [GO-13327],E.T.M. acknowledges HST grant GO-13327.,DF8BN,,,GAMMA-RAY BURSTS; HUBBLE-SPACE-TELESCOPE; M87 JET; 3C 264; EMISSION; MOTION; MODEL,7553.0,NATURE,Nature,English,28.0,No,"van der Marel, Roeland/0000-0001-7827-7825; Norman, Colin/0000-0002-5222-5717","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",28-May,13.0,LONDON,26017450.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2015.0,,"Meyer, ET (reprint author), Space Telescope Sci Inst, 3700 San Martin Dr, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,6.0,A kiloparsec-scale internal shock collision in the jet of a nearby radio galaxy,2.0,5.0,WOS:000371582000002,496.0,521,Multidisciplinary Sciences,6,marco,chiaberge,4640.0,2493,male,0.99,_UA9uSEAAAAJ,3,"(4126, 9345]",48666263,1,na,0,NGC 4293,na,0,0
63,164,13.0,"The epiblast is the mammalian embryonic tissue that contains the pluripotent stem cells that generate the whole embryo. We have established a method for inducing functional genetic mosaics in the mouse. Using this system, here we show that induction of a mosaic imbalance of Myc expression in the epiblast provokes the expansion of cells with higher Myc levels through the apoptotic elimination of cells with lower levels, without disrupting development. In contrast, homogeneous shifts in Myc levels did not affect epiblast cell viability, indicating that the observed competition results from comparison of relative Myc levels between epiblast cells. During normal development we found that Myc levels are intrinsically heterogeneous among epiblast cells, and that endogenous cell competition refines the epiblast cell population through the elimination of cells with low relative Myc levels. These results show that natural cell competition in the early mammalian embryo contributes to the selection of the epiblast cell pool.","Claveria, Cristina; Giovinazzo, Giovanna; Sierra, Rocio; Torres, Miguel","Claveria, C; Giovinazzo, G; Sierra, R; Torres, M",39.0,"[Claveria, Cristina; Giovinazzo, Giovanna; Sierra, Rocio; Torres, Miguel] CNIC, Dept Desarrollo & Reparac Cardiovasc, E-28029 Madrid, Spain",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12389,Article,,mtorres@cnic.es,U53,"Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (MINECO); Pro-CNIC Foundation; MINECO/ISCIII TerCel [RD06/0010/0008]; Human Frontiers Science Program [RGP0008/2004]; Madrid Regional Government [S-SAL-0190-2006, P2010/BMD-2315]","We thank S.

64,54,400.0,"Heat flow between a large thermal `bath' and a smaller system brings them progressively closer to thermal equilibrium while increasing their entropy(1). Fluctuations involving a small fraction of a statistical ensemble of systems interacting with the bath result in deviations from this trend. In this respect, quantum and classical thermodynamics are in agreement(1-5). Here we predict a different trend in a purely quantum mechanical setting: disturbances of thermal equilibrium between two-level systems (TLSs) and a bath(6), caused by frequent, brief quantum non-demolition(7-10) measurements of the TLS energy states. By making the measurements increasingly frequent, we encounter first the anti-Zeno regime and then the Zeno regime (namely where the TLSs' relaxation respectively speeds up and slows down(11-15)). The corresponding entropy and temperature of both the system and the bath are then found to either decrease or increase depending only on the rate of observation, contrary to the standard thermodynamical rules that hold for memory-less ( Markov) baths(2,5). From a practical viewpoint, these anomalies may offer the possibility of very fast control of heat and entropy in quantum systems, allowing cooling and state purification over an interval much shorter than the time needed for thermal equilibration or for a feedback control loop.","Erez, Noam; Gordon, Goren; Nest, Mathias; Kurizki, Gershon","Erez, N; Gordon, G; Nest, M; Kurizki, G",724.0,"[Erez, Noam; Gordon, Goren; Kurizki, Gershon] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Chem Phys, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Nest, Mathias] Univ Potsdam, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06873,Article,,gershon.kurizki@weizmann.ac.il,727,,,285QY,,,DECAY; WORK; BATH,7188.0,NATURE,Nature,English,24.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",10-Apr,4.0,LONDON,18401404.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,"Nest, Mathias/C-1412-2010","Kurizki, G (reprint author), Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Chem Phys, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,104.0,Thermodynamic control by frequent quantum measurements,0.0,23.0,WOS:000254792500039,400.0,452,Multidisciplinary Sciences,106,gershon,kurizki,8840.0,3,male,1.0,RkrJ0LsAAAAJ,3,"(4126, 9345]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0

66,184,188.0,"Adoptive cell transfer therapies (ACTs) with cytotoxic T cells that target melanocytic antigens can achieve remissions in patients with metastatic melanomas, but tumours frequently relapse(1,2). Hypotheses explaining the acquired resistance to ACTs include the selection of antigen-deficient tumour cell variants(3-5) and the induction of T-cell tolerance(6). However, the lack of appropriate experimental melanoma models has so far impeded clear insights into the underlying mechanisms. Here we establish an effective ACT protocol in a genetically engineered mouse melanoma model that recapitulates tumour regression, remission and relapse as seen in patients. We report the unexpected observation that melanomas acquire ACT resistance through an inflammation-induced reversible loss of melanocytic antigens. In serial transplantation experiments, melanoma cells switch between a differentiated and a dedifferentiated phenotype in response to T-cell-driven inflammatory stimuli. We identified the proinflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha as a crucial factor that directly caused reversible dedifferentiation of mouse and human melanoma cells. Tumour cells exposed to TNF-alpha were poorly recognized by T cells specific for melanocytic antigens, whereas recognition by T cells specific for non-melanocytic antigens was unaffected or even increased. Our results demonstrate that the phenotypic plasticity of melanoma cells in an inflammatory microenvironment contributes to tumour relapse after initially successful T-cell immunotherapy. On the basis of our work, we propose that future ACT protocols should simultaneously target melanocytic and non-melanocytic antigens to ensure broad recognition of both differentiated and dedifferentiated melanoma cells, and include strategies to sustain T-cell effector functions by blocking immune-inhibitory mechanisms in the tumour microenvironment.","Landsberg, Jennifer; Kohlmeyer, Judith; Renn, Marcel; Bald, Tobias; Rogava, Meri; Cron, Mira; Fatho, Martina; Lennerz, Volker; Woelfel, Thomas; Hoelzel, Michael; Tueting, Thomas","Landsberg, J; Kohlmeyer, J; Renn, M; Bald, T; Rogava, M; Cron, M; Fatho, M; Lennerz, V; Wolfel, T; Holzel, M; Tuting, T",412.0,"[Landsberg, Jennifer; Kohlmeyer, Judith; Renn, Marcel; Bald, Tobias; Rogava, Meri; Cron, Mira; Tueting, Thomas] Univ Bonn, Dept Dermatol & Allergy, Lab Expt Dermatol, D-53105 Bonn, Germany; [Fatho, Martina; Lennerz, Volker; Woelfel, Thomas] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Univ Med Ctr, Dept Med 3, D-55101 Mainz, Germany; [Hoelzel, Michael] Univ Bonn, Unit RNA Biol, Dept Clin Chem & Clin Pharmacol, D-53105 Bonn, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11538,Article,,thomas.tueting@ukb.uni-bonn.de,+,"DFG [SFB832, SFB704, SFB 432]; Deutsche Krebshilfe (P9 in the Melanoma Research Network); BONFOR","We would like to thank G.

67,232,303.0,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) remains a major medical problem. Antiviral treatment is only partially effective and a vaccine does not exist. Development of more effective therapies has been hampered by the lack of a suitable small animal model. Although xenotransplantation of immunodeficient mice with human hepatocytes has shown promise, these models are subject to important challenges. Building on the previous observation that CD81 and occludin comprise the minimal human factors required to render mouse cells permissive to HCV entry in vitro(4), we attempted murine humanization via a genetic approach. Here we show that expression of two human genes is sufficient to allow HCV infection of fully immunocompetent inbred mice. We establish a precedent for applying mouse genetics to dissect viral entry and validate the role of scavenger receptor type B class I for HCV uptake. We demonstrate that HCV can be blocked by passive immunization, as well as showing that a recombinant vaccinia virus vector induces humoral immunity and confers partial protection against heterologous challenge. This system recapitulates a portion of the HCV life cycle in an immunocompetent rodent for the first time, opening opportunities for studying viral pathogenesis and immunity and comprising an effective platform for testing HCV entry inhibitors in vivo.","Dorner, Marcus; Horwitz, Joshua A.; Robbins, Justin B.; Barry, Walter T.; Feng, Qian; Mu, Kathy; Jones, Christopher T.; Schoggins, John W.; Catanese, Maria Teresa; Burton, Dennis R.; Law, Mansun; Rice, Charles M.; Ploss, Alexander","Dorner, M; Horwitz, JA; Robbins, JB; Barry, WT; Feng, Q; Mu, K; Jones, CT; Schoggins, JW; Catanese, MT; Burton, DR; Law, M; Rice, CM; Ploss, A",208.0,"[Dorner, Marcus; Horwitz, Joshua A.; Barry, Walter T.; Feng, Qian; Mu, Kathy; Jones, Christopher T.; Schoggins, John W.; Catanese, Maria Teresa; Rice, Charles M.; Ploss, Alexander] Rockefeller Univ, Ctr Study Hepatitis C, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Robbins, Justin B.; Burton, Dennis R.; Law, Mansun] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Immunol & Microbial Sci, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Burton, Dennis R.] Scripps Res Inst, IAVI Neutralizing Antibody Ctr, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Burton, Dennis R.] Ragon Inst MGH MIT & Harvard, Boston, MA 02129 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10168,Article,,aploss@rockefeller.edu,U246,"National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases [RC1DK087193]; National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease [R01AI072613, R01AI079031, R01AI071084]; Starr Foundation; Greenberg Medical Institute; German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgesellschaft); Rockefeller University; National Institute of Health [F32DK082155, F32DK081193]","We thank J.

68,109,388.0,"Recent studies into the global causes of severe diarrhoea in young children have identified the protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium as the second most important diarrhoeal pathogen after rotavirus(1-3). Diarrhoeal disease is estimated to be responsible for 10.5% of overall child mortality(4). Cryptosporidium is also an opportunistic pathogen in the contexts of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-caused AIDS and organ transplantation(5,6). There is no vaccine and only a single approved drug that provides no benefit for those in gravest danger: malnourished children and immunocompromised patients(7,8). Cryptosporidiosisdrug and vaccine development is limited by the poor tractability of the parasite, which includes a lack of systems for continuous culture, facile animal models, and molecular genetic tools(3,9). Here we describe an experimental framework to genetically modify this important human pathogen. We established and optimized transfection of C. parvum sporozoites in tissue culture. To isolate stable transgenics we developed a mouse model that delivers sporozoites directly into the intestine, aCryptosporidium clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 system, and in vivo selection for aminoglycoside resistance. We derived reporter parasites suitable for in vitro and in vivo drug screening, and we evaluated the basis of drug susceptibility by gene knockout. We anticipate that the ability to genetically engineer this parasite will be transformative for Cryptosporidium research. Genetic reporters will provide quantitative correlates for disease, cure and protection, and the role of parasite genes in these processes is now open to rigorous investigation.","Vinayak, Sumiti; Pawlowic, Mattie C.; Sateriale, Adam; Brooks, Carrie F.; Studstill, Caleb J.; Bar-Peled, Yael; Cipriano, Michael J.; Striepen, Boris","Vinayak, S; Pawlowic, MC; Sateriale, A; Brooks, CF; Studstill, CJ; Bar-Peled, Y; Cipriano, MJ; Striepen, B",477.0,"[Vinayak, Sumiti; Pawlowic, Mattie C.; Sateriale, Adam; Brooks, Carrie F.; Studstill, Caleb J.; Bar-Peled, Yael; Cipriano, Michael J.; Striepen, Boris] Univ Georgia, Ctr Trop & Emerging Global Dis, Paul D Coverdell Ctr, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Striepen, Boris] Univ Georgia, Dept Cellular Biol, Paul D Coverdell Ctr, Athens, GA 30602 USA",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14651,Article,1476-4687,striepen@uga.edu,U232,National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R01AI112427]; Centers for Disease Control; University of Georgia Research Foundation;  [NIH T32AI060546],"We thank L.

69,233,337.0,"How dynamic signalling and extensive tissue rearrangements interact to generate complex patterns and shapes during embryogenesis is poorly understood(1-3). Here we characterize the signalling events taking place during early morphogenesis of chick skeletal muscles. We show that muscle progenitors present in somites require the transient activation of NOTCH signalling to undergo terminal differentiation. The NOTCH ligand Delta1 is expressed in a mosaic pattern in neural crest cells that migrate past the somites. Gain and loss of Delta1 function in neural crest modifies NOTCH signalling in somites, which results in delayed or premature myogenesis. Our results indicate that the neural crest regulates early muscle formation by a unique mechanism that relies on the migration of Delta1-expressing neural crest cells to trigger the transient activation of NOTCH signalling in selected muscle progenitors. This dynamic signalling guarantees a balanced and progressive differentiation of the muscle progenitor pool.","Rios, Anne C.; Serralbo, Olivier; Salgado, David; Marcelle, Christophe","Rios, AC; Serralbo, O; Salgado, D; Marcelle, C",532.0,"[Rios, Anne C.; Serralbo, Olivier; Salgado, David; Marcelle, Christophe] Monash Univ, EMBL Australia, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Rios, Anne C.; Serralbo, Olivier; Salgado, David; Marcelle, Christophe] Monash Univ, ARMI, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09970,Article,,christophe.marcelle@monash.edu,U279,Agence Nationale pour le Recherche (ANR); EU,"We thank N.

70,75,469.0,"Dispersal has a significant impact on lifetime reproductive success(1), and is often more prevalent in one sex than the other(2). In group- living mammals, dispersal is normally male- biased and in theory this sexual bias could be a response by males to female mate preferences, competition for access to females or resources, or the result of males avoiding inbreeding(2-7). There is a lack of studies on social mammals that simultaneously assess these factors and measure the fitness consequences of male dispersal decisions. Here we show that male- biased dispersal in the spotted hyaena ( Crocuta crocuta) most probably results from an adaptive response by males to simple female mate- choice rules that have evolved to avoid inbreeding. Microsatellite profiling revealed that females preferred sires that were born into or immigrated into the female's group after the female was born. Furthermore, young females preferred short- tenured sires and older females preferred longer- tenured sires. Males responded to these female mate preferences by initiating their reproductive careers in groups containing the highest number of young females. As a consequence, 11% of males started their reproductive career in their natal group and 89% of males dispersed. Males that started reproduction in groups containing the highest number of young females had a higher long- term reproductive success than males that did not. The female mate- choice rules ensured that females effectively avoided inbreeding without the need to discriminate directly against close kin or males born in their own group, or to favour immigrant males. The extent of male dispersal as a response to such female mate preferences depends on the demographic structure of breeding groups, rather than the genetic relatedness between females and males.","Hoener, O.

71,229,222.0,"A measurement necessarily changes the quantum state being measured, a phenomenon known as back-action. Real measurements, however, almost always cause a much stronger back-action than is required by the laws of quantum mechanics. Quantum non-demolition measurements have been devised(1-6) that keep the additional back-action entirely within observables other than the one being measured. However, this back-action on other observables often imposes its own constraints. In particular, free-space optical detection methods for single atoms and ions (such as the shelving technique(7), a sensitive and well-developed method) inevitably require spontaneous scattering, even in the dispersive regime(8). This causes irreversible energy exchange (heating), which is a limitation in atom-based quantum information processing, where it obviates straightforward reuse of the qubit. No such energy exchange is required by quantum mechanics(9). Here we experimentally demonstrate optical detection of an atomic qubit with significantly less than one spontaneous scattering event. We measure the transmission and reflection of an optical cavity(10-13) containing the atom. In addition to the qubit detection itself, we quantitatively measure how much spontaneous scattering has occurred. This allows us to relate the information gained to the amount of spontaneous emission, and we obtain a detection error below 10 per cent while scattering less than 0.2 photons on average. Furthermore, we performa quantum Zeno-type experiment to quantify the measurement back-action, and find that every incident photon leads to an almost complete state collapse. Together, these results constitute a full experimental characterization of a quantum measurement in the 'energy exchange-free' regime below a single spontaneous emission event. Besides its fundamental interest, this approach could significantly simplify proposed neutral-atom quantum computation schemes(14), and may enable sensitive detection of molecules and atoms lacking closed transitions.","Volz, Juergen; Gehr, Roger; Dubois, Guilhem; Esteve, Jerome; Reichel, Jakob","Volz, J; Gehr, R; Dubois, G; Esteve, J; Reichel, J",210.0,"[Volz, Juergen; Gehr, Roger; Dubois, Guilhem; Esteve, Jerome; Reichel, Jakob] Univ Paris 06, CNRS, ENS, Lab Kastler Brossel, F-75005 Paris, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10225,Article,1476-4687,jakob.reichel@ens.fr,U117,EU [247687]; Institut Francilien pour la Recherche sur les Atomes Froids (IFRAF); EURYI grant 'Integrated Quantum Devices',"This work was funded in part by the AQUTE Integrated Project of the EU (grant no. 247687), by the Institut Francilien pour la Recherche sur les Atomes Froids (IFRAF), and by the EURYI grant 'Integrated Quantum Devices'.",791UA,,,QUANTUM; CAVITY,7355.0,NATURE,Nature,English,26.0,No,"Esteve, Jerome/0000-0002-1556-8120; Volz, Jurgen/0000-0002-3174-2141; Reichel, Jakob/0000-0003-3420-4178","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",14-Jul,5.0,LONDON,21753851.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2011.0,"Esteve, Jerome/G-1084-2014; Volz, Jurgen/N-6457-2016","Reichel, J (reprint author), Univ Paris 06, CNRS, ENS, Lab Kastler Brossel, 24 Rue Lhomond, F-75005 Paris, France.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,49.0,Measurement of the internal state of a single atom without energy exchange,0.0,18.0,WOS:000292690500046,222.0,475,Multidisciplinary Sciences,49,jakob,reichel,8184.0,148,male,0.99,EOrqDVAAAAAJ,3,"(4126, 9345]",38684068,1,174030,1,Jadup and Boel,Jadup and Boel,0,0
72,161,475.0,"Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved catabolic process involved in several physiological and pathological processes(1,2). Although primarily cytoprotective, autophagy can also contribute to cell death; it is thus important to understand what distinguishes the life or death decision in autophagic cells(3). Here we report that induction of autophagy is coupled to reduction of histone H4 lysine 16 acetylation (H4K16ac) through downregulation of the histone acetyltransferase hMOF (also called KAT8 or MYST1), and demonstrate that this histone modification regulates the outcome of autophagy. At a genome-wide level, we find that H4K16 deacetylation is associated predominantly with the downregulation of autophagy-related genes. Antagonizing H4K16ac downregulation upon autophagy induction results in the promotion of cell death. Our findings establish that alteration in a specific histone post-translational modification during autophagy affects the transcriptional regulation of autophagy-related genes and initiates a regulatory feedback loop, which serves as a key determinant of survival versus death responses upon autophagy induction.","Fullgrabe, Jens; Lynch-Day, Melinda A.; Heldring, Nina; Li, Wenbo; Struijk, Robert B.; Ma, Qi; Hermanson, Ola; Rosenfeld, Michael G.; Klionsky, Daniel J.; Joseph, Bertrand","Fullgrabe, J; Lynch-Day, MA; Heldring, N; Li, WB; Struijk, RB; Ma, Q; Hermanson, O; Rosenfeld, MG; Klionsky, DJ; Joseph, B",468.0,"[Fullgrabe, Jens; Struijk, Robert B.; Joseph, Bertrand] Karolinska Inst, Dept Oncol Pathol, Canc Ctr Karolinska, S-17176 Stockholm, Sweden; [Lynch-Day, Melinda A.; Klionsky, Daniel J.] Univ Michigan, Inst Life Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Lynch-Day, Melinda A.; Klionsky, Daniel J.] Univ Michigan, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Lynch-Day, Melinda A.; Klionsky, Daniel J.] Univ Michigan, Dept Biol Chem, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Heldring, Nina; Hermanson, Ola] Karolinska Inst, Dept Neurosci, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Li, Wenbo; Ma, Qi; Rosenfeld, Michael G.] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Ma, Qi] Univ Calif San Diego, Grad Program Bioinformat & Syst Biol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12313,Article,1476-4687,bertrand.joseph@ki.se,+,Karolinska Institutet Foundations; Rackham Predoctoral Fellowship; US Department of Defense [BC110381]; National Institutes of Health [GM53396]; National Institutes of Health/National Cancer Institute; Department of Defense; Swedish Cancer Society; Swedish Childhood Cancer Foundation; Swedish Research Council,"We thank G.

Long-standing theory suggests that soil organic matter is composed of inherently stable and chemically unique compounds. Here we argue that the available evidence does not support the formation of large-molecular-size and persistent 'humic substances' in soils. Instead, soil organic matter is a continuum of progressively decomposing organic compounds. We discuss implications of this view of the nature of soil organic matter for aquatic health, soil carbon-climate interactions and land management.","Lehmann, Johannes; Kleber, Markus","Lehmann, J; Kleber, M",60.0,"[Lehmann, Johannes] Cornell Univ, Coll Agr & Life Sci, Soil & Crop Sci, Sch Integrated Plant Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Lehmann, Johannes] Cornell Univ, Atkinson Ctr Sustainable Future, Ithaca, NY USA; [Kleber, Markus] Oregon State Univ, Dept Crop & Soil Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Kleber, Markus] Leibniz Zentrum Agrarlandschaftsforsch ZALF, Inst Bodenlandschaftsforsch, Muncheberg, Germany",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature16069,Article,1476-4687,CL273@cornell.edu,68,,,CX3NO,Y,Y,BLACK CARBON BIOCHAR; EARTH SYSTEM MODELS; HUMIC SUBSTANCES; LITTER DECOMPOSITION; MOLECULAR-STRUCTURE; TEMPERATURE SENSITIVITY; ELECTRON-ACCEPTORS; GLASS-TRANSITION; CONCEPTUAL-MODEL; CLIMATE-CHANGE,7580.0,NATURE,Nature,English,125.0,No,"Lehmann, Johannes/0000-0002-4701-2936","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",3-Dec,9.0,LONDON,26595271.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2015.0,"Lehmann, Johannes/H-2682-2014","Lehmann, J (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Coll Agr & Life Sci, Soil & Crop Sci, Sch Integrated Plant Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,157.0,The contentious nature of soil organic matter,172.0,661.0,WOS:000365606000049,54.0,528,Multidisciplinary Sciences,163,markus,kleber,8813.0,412,male,1.0,cX7omKIAAAAJ,3,"(4126, 9345]",27105426,1,41579118,1,FC Bayern Munich (basketball),FC Bayern Munich (basketball),0,0
74,192,272.0,"B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) expression is an important feature of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), one of the most prevalent B-cell neoplasias in Western countries(1). The presence of stereotyped and quasi-identical BCRs in different CLL patients suggests that recognition of specific antigens might drive CLL pathogenesis. Here we show that, in contrast to other B-cell neoplasias, CLL-derived BCRs induce antigen-independent cell-autonomous signalling, which is dependent on the heavy-chain complementarity-determining region (HCDR3) and an internal epitope of the BCR. Indeed, transferring the HCDR3 of a CLL-derived BCR provides autonomous signalling capacity to a non-autonomously active BCR, whereas mutations in the internal epitope abolish this capacity. Because BCR expression was required for the binding of secreted CLL-derived BCRs to target cells, and mutations in the internal epitope reduced this binding, our results indicate a new model for CLL pathogenesis, with cell-autonomous antigen-independent signalling as a crucial pathogenic mechanism.","Duehren-von Minden, Marcus; Uebelhart, Rudolf; Schneider, Dunja; Wossning, Thomas; Bach, Martina P.; Buchner, Maike; Hofmann, Daniel; Surova, Elena; Follo, Marie; Koehler, Fabian; Wardemann, Hedda; Zirlik, Katja; Veelken, Hendrik; Jumaa, Hassan","Duhren-von Minden, M; Ubelhart, R; Schneider, D; Wossning, T; Bach, MP; Buchner, M; Hofmann, D; Surova, E; Follo, M; Kohler, F; Wardemann, H; Zirlik, K; Veelken, H; Jumaa, H",309.0,"[Duehren-von Minden, Marcus; Uebelhart, Rudolf; Schneider, Dunja; Wossning, Thomas; Bach, Martina P.; Hofmann, Daniel; Surova, Elena; Koehler, Fabian; Jumaa, Hassan] Univ Freiburg, Ctr Biol Signaling Studies BIOSS, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Uebelhart, Rudolf; Surova, Elena] Univ Freiburg, Spemann Grad Sch Biol & Med, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Buchner, Maike; Follo, Marie; Zirlik, Katja] Univ Med Ctr Freiburg, Dept Hematol Oncol, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [Wardemann, Hedda] Max Planck Inst Infect Biol, Max Planck Res Grp Mol Immunol, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Veelken, Hendrik] Leiden Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Hematol, NL-2333 ZA Leiden, Netherlands; [Jumaa, Hassan] Univ Freiburg, Fac Biol, Dept Mol Immunol, D-79108 Freiburg, Germany; [Jumaa, Hassan] Max Planck Inst Immunobiol & Epigenet, D-79108 Freiburg, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11309,Article,1476-4687,jumaa@immunbio.mpg.de,+,"Deutsche Krebshilfe [108935]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB746, JU463/2-1]; Excellence Initiative of the German Federal and State Governments [GSC-4]","We thank C.

The preparation of zeolitic materials with extralarge pores and chiral frameworks would permit many new applications. Two important steps in this direction include the synthesis(4) of ITQ-33, a stable zeolite with 18 x 10 x 10 ring windows, and the synthesis(5) of SU-32, which has an intrinsically chiral zeolite structure and where each crystal exhibits only one handedness. Here we present a germanosilicate zeolite (ITQ-37) with extralarge 30-ring windows. Its structure was determined by combining selected area electron diffraction ( SAED) and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) in a charge-flipping algorithm(6). The framework follows the SrSi2 (srs) minimal net(7) and forms two unique cavities, each of which is connected to three other cavities to form a gyroidal channel system. These cavities comprise the enantiomorphous srs net of the framework. ITQ-37 is the first chiral zeolite with one single gyroidal channel. It has the lowest framework density (10.3 T atoms per 1,000 angstrom(3)) of all existing 4-coordinated crystalline oxide frameworks, and the pore volume of the corresponding silica polymorph would be 0.38 cm(3) g(-1).","Sun, Junliang; Bonneau, Charlotte; Cantin, Angel; Corma, Avelino; Diaz-Cabanas, Maria J.; Moliner, Manuel; Zhang, Daliang; Li, Mingrun; Zou, Xiaodong","Sun, JL; Bonneau, C; Cantin, A; Corma, A; Diaz-Cabanas, MJ; Moliner, M; Zhang, DL; Li, MR; Zou, XD",1154.0,"[Cantin, Angel; Corma, Avelino; Diaz-Cabanas, Maria J.; Moliner, Manuel] Univ Politecn Valencia, CSIC, Inst Tecnol Quim, E-46022 Valencia, Spain; [Sun, Junliang; Bonneau, Charlotte; Zhang, Daliang; Li, Mingrun; Zou, Xiaodong] Stockholm Univ, EXSELENT Porous Mat, Struct Chem & Berzelii Ctr, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07957,Article,1476-4687,acorma@itq.upv.es; zou@struc.su.se,U90,CICYT [MAT 2006-14274-C02-01]; Swedish Research Council; Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems (VINNOVA); Carl-Trygger and Wenner-Gren foundations,"This project is supported by the CICYT ( Project MAT 2006-14274-C02-01 and Prometeo 2008 GV), the Swedish Research Council (VR) and the Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems (VINNOVA).

76,206,171.0,"Spontaneous collective motion, as in some flocks of bird and schools of fish, is an example of an emergent phenomenon. Such phenomena are at present of great interest(1-5) and physicists have put forward a number of theoretical results that so far lack experimental verification(6-8). In animal behaviour studies, large-scale data collection is now technologically possible, but data are still scarce and arise from observations rather than controlled experiments. Multicellular biological systems, such as bacterial colonies or tissues(9,10), allow more control, but may have many hidden variables and interactions, hindering proper tests of theoretical ideas. However, in systems on the subcellular scale such tests may be possible, particularly in in vitro experiments with only few purified components(11-13). Motility assays, in which protein filaments are driven by molecular motors grafted to a substrate in the presence of ATP, can show collective motion for high densities of motors and attached filaments. This was demonstrated recently for the actomyosin system(14,15), but a complete understanding of the mechanisms at work is still lacking. Here we report experiments in which microtubules are propelled by surface-bound dyneins. In this system it is possible to study the local interaction: we find that colliding microtubules align with each other with high probability. At high densities, this alignment results in self-organization of the microtubules, which are on average 15 mu m long, into vortices with diameters of around 400 mu m. Inside the vortices, the microtubules circulate both clockwise and anticlockwise. On longer timescales, the vortices form a lattice structure. The emergence of these structures, as verified by a mathematical model, is the result of the smooth, reptation-like motion of single microtubules in combination with local interactions (the nematic alignment due to collisions)-there is no need for long-range interactions. Apart from its potential relevance to cortical arrays in plant cells(16,17) and other biological situations, our study provides evidence for the existence of previously unsuspected universality classes of collective motion phenomena.","Sumino, Yutaka; Nagai, Ken H.; Shitaka, Yuji; Tanaka, Dan; Yoshikawa, Kenichi; Chate, Hugues; Oiwa, Kazuhiro","Sumino, Y; Nagai, KH; Shitaka, Y; Tanaka, D; Yoshikawa, K; Chate, H; Oiwa, K",448.0,"[Shitaka, Yuji; Oiwa, Kazuhiro] Natl Inst Informat & Communicat Technol, Adv ICT Res Inst, Kobe, Hyogo 6512492, Japan; [Nagai, Ken H.] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Phys, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Tanaka, Dan] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Informat Sci, Dept Complex Syst Sci, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Yoshikawa, Kenichi] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Phys, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Yoshikawa, Kenichi] JST, ICORP, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Chate, Hugues] CEA Saclay, Serv Phys Etat Condense, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Oiwa, Kazuhiro] Univ Hyogo, Grad Sch Life Sci, Harima, Hyogo 6781297, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10874,Article,1476-4687,oiwa@nict.go.jp,452,JSPS [23-1819];  [23840019];  [21340023];  [20244067],"We thank H.

78,86,19.0,"Tandem repeat proteins, which are formed by repetition of modular units of protein sequence and structure, play important biological roles as macromolecular binding and scaffolding domains, enzymes, and building blocks for the assembly of fibrous materials(1,2). The modular nature of repeat proteins enables the rapid construction and diversification of extended binding surfaces by duplication and recombination of simple building blocks(3,4). The overall architecture of tandem repeat protein structures-which is dictated by the internal geometry and local packing of the repeat building blocks-is highly diverse, ranging from extended, super-helical folds that bind peptide, DNA, and RNA partners(5-9), to closed and compact conformations with internal cavities suitable for small molecule binding and catalysis(10). Here we report the development and validation of computational methods for de novo design of tandem repeat protein architectures driven purely by geometric criteria defining the inter-repeat geometry, without reference to the sequences and structures of existing repeat protein families. We have applied these methods to design a series of closed alpha-solenoid(11) repeat structures (alpha-toroids) in which the inter-repeat packing geometry is constrained so as to juxtapose the amino (N) and carboxy (C) termini; several of these designed structures have been validated by X-ray crystallography. Unlike previous approaches to tandem repeat protein engineering(12-20), our design procedure does not rely on template sequence or structural information taken from natural repeat proteins and hence can produce structures unlike those seen in nature. As an example, we have successfully designed and validated closed alpha-solenoid repeats with a left-handed helical architecture that-to our knowledge-is not yet present in the protein structure database(21).","Doyle, Lindsey; Hallinan, Jazmine; Bolduc, Jill; Parmeggiani, Fabio; Baker, David; Stoddard, Barry L.; Bradley, Philip","Doyle, L; Hallinan, J; Bolduc, J; Parmeggiani, F; Baker, D; Stoddard, BL; Bradley, P",585.0,"[Doyle, Lindsey; Hallinan, Jazmine; Bolduc, Jill; Stoddard, Barry L.; Bradley, Philip] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Div Basic Sci, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Parmeggiani, Fabio; Baker, David] Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Parmeggiani, Fabio; Baker, David; Bradley, Philip] Univ Washington, Inst Prot Design, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Baker, David] Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Bradley, Philip] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Div Publ Hlth Sci, Seattle, WA 98019 USA",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature16191,Article,1476-4687,pbradley@fredhutch.org,+,"National Institutes of Health [R21GM106117, R01GM49857]; Swiss National Science Foundation Postdoc Fellowship [PBZHP3-125470]; Human Frontier Science Program Long-Term Fellowship [LT000070/2009-L]","The authors thank Scientific Computing at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center for providing the computational infrastructure necessary for this project.

79,11,291.0,"DEAD-box helicases are conserved enzymes involved in nearly all aspects of RNA metabolism, but their mechanisms of action remain unclear. Here, we investigated the mechanism of the DEAD-box protein Mss116 on its natural substrate, the group II intron ai5 gamma. Group II introns are structurally complex catalytic RNAs considered evolutionarily related to the eukaryotic spliceosome, and an interesting paradigm for large RNA folding. We used single-molecule fluorescence to monitor the effect of Mss116 on folding dynamics of a minimal active construct, ai5 gamma-D135. The data show that Mss116 stimulates dynamic sampling between states along the folding pathway, an effect previously observed only with high Mg(2+) concentrations. Furthermore, the data indicate that Mss116 promotes folding through discrete ATP-independent and ATP-dependent steps. We propose that Mss116 stimulates group II intron folding through a multi-step process that involves electrostatic stabilization of early intermediates and ATP hydrolysis during the final stages of native state assembly.","Karunatilaka, Krishanthi S.; Solem, Amanda; Pyle, Anna Marie; Rueda, David","Karunatilaka, KS; Solem, A; Pyle, AM; Rueda, D",935.0,"[Karunatilaka, Krishanthi S.; Solem, Amanda; Rueda, David] Wayne State Univ, Dept Chem, Detroit, MI 48202 USA; [Pyle, Anna Marie] Yale Univ, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Pyle, Anna Marie] Yale Univ, Dept Chem, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Pyle, Anna Marie] Yale Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09422,Article,,anna.pyle@yale.edu; david.rueda@wayne.edu,U75,"National Institutes of Health [R01GM085116, R01GM050313]; National Science Foundation [MCB-0747285]","We thank R.

80,212,269.0,"The concept of disease-specific chemotherapy was developed a century ago. Dyes and arsenical compounds that displayed selectivity against trypanosomes were central to this work(1,2), and the drugs that emerged remain in use for treating human African trypanosomiasis (HAT)(3). The importance of understanding the mechanisms underlying selective drug action and resistance for the development of improved HAT therapies has been recognized, but these mechanisms have remained largely unknown. Here we use all five current HAT drugs for genome-scale RNA interference target sequencing (RIT-seq) screens in Trypanosoma brucei, revealing the transporters, organelles, enzymes and metabolic pathways that function to facilitate antitrypanosomal drug action. RIT-seq profiling identifies both known drug importers(4,5) and the only known prodrug activator(6), and links more than fifty additional genes to drug action. A bloodstream stage-specific invariant surface glycoprotein (ISG75) family mediates suramin uptake, and the AP1 adaptin complex, lysosomal proteases and major lysosomal transmembrane protein, as well as spermidine and N-acetylglucosamine biosynthesis, all contribute to suramin action. Further screens link ubiquinone availability to nitro-drug action, plasma membrane P-type H+-ATPases to pentamidine action, and trypanothione and several putative kinases to melarsoprol action. We also demonstrate a major role for aquaglyceroporins in pentamidine and melarsoprol cross-resistance. These advances in our understanding of mechanisms of antitrypanosomal drug efficacy and resistance will aid the rational design of new therapies and help to combat drug resistance, and provide unprecedented molecular insight into the mode of action of antitrypanosomal drugs.","Alsford, Sam; Eckert, Sabine; Baker, Nicola; Glover, Lucy; Sanchez-Flores, Alejandro; Leung, Ka Fai; Turner, Daniel J.; Field, Mark C.; Berriman, Matthew; Horn, David","Alsford, S; Eckert, S; Baker, N; Glover, L; Sanchez-Flores, A; Leung, KF; Turner, DJ; Field, MC; Berriman, M; Horn, D",232.0,"[Alsford, Sam; Baker, Nicola; Glover, Lucy; Horn, David] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London WC1E 7HT, England; [Eckert, Sabine; Sanchez-Flores, Alejandro; Turner, Daniel J.; Berriman, Matthew] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Cambridge CB10 1SA, England; [Leung, Ka Fai; Field, Mark C.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Pathol, Cambridge CB2 1QP, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10771,Article,1476-4687,david.horn@lshtm.ac.uk,U125,"Wellcome Trust [093010/Z/10/Z, 085775/Z/08/Z, 090007/Z/09/Z]; Bloomsbury colleges PhD studentship","We thank J.

82,222,25.0,"Many animals attract mating partners through the release of volatile sex pheromones, which can convey information on the species, gender and receptivity of the sender to induce innate courtship and mating behaviours by the receiver(1). Male Drosophila melanogaster fruitflies display stereotyped reproductive behaviours towards females, and these behaviours are controlled by the neural circuitry expressing male-specific isoforms of the transcription factor Fruitless (FRUM)(2-5). However, the volatile pheromone ligands, receptors and olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) that promote male courtship have not been identified in this important model organism. Here we describe a novel courtship function of Ionotropic receptor 84a (IR84a), which is a member of the chemosensory ionotropic glutamate receptor family(6), in a previously uncharacterized population of FRUM-positive OSNs. IR84a-expressing neurons are activated not by fly-derived chemicals but by the aromatic odours phenylacetic acid and phenylacetaldehyde, which are widely found in fruit and other plant tissues(7) that serve as food sources and oviposition sites for drosophilid flies(8). Mutation of Ir84a abolishes both odour-evoked and spontaneous electrophysiological activity in these neurons and markedly reduces male courtship behaviour. Conversely, male courtship is increased-in an IR84a-dependent manner-in the presence of phenylacetic acid but not in the presence of another fruit odour that does not activate IR84a. Interneurons downstream of IR84a-expressing OSNs innervate a pheromone-processing centre in the brain. Whereas IR84a orthologues and phenylacetic-acid-responsive neurons are present in diverse drosophilid species, IR84a is absent from insects that rely on long-range sex pheromones. Our results suggest a model in which IR84a couples food presence to the activation of the fru(M) courtship circuitry in fruitflies. These findings reveal an unusual but effective evolutionary solution to coordinate feeding and oviposition site selection with reproductive behaviours through a specific sensory pathway.","Grosjean, Yael; Rytz, Raphael; Farine, Jean-Pierre; Abuin, Liliane; Cortot, Jerome; Jefferis, Gregory S.

84,213,271.0,"Two defining functional features of ion channels are ion selectivity and channel gating. Ion selectivity is generally considered an immutable property of the open channel structure, whereas gating involves transitions between open and closed channel states, typically without changes in ion selectivity(1). In store-operated Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels, the molecular mechanism of channel gating by the CRAC channel activator, stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), remains unknown. CRAC channels are distinguished by a very high Ca2+ selectivity and are instrumental in generating sustained intracellular calcium concentration elevations that are necessary for gene expression and effector function in many eukaryotic cells(2). Here we probe the central features of the STIM1 gating mechanism in the human CRAC channel protein, ORAI1, and identify V102, a residue located in the extracellular region of the pore, as a candidate for the channel gate. Mutations at V102 produce constitutively active CRAC channels that are open even in the absence of STIM1. Unexpectedly, although STIM1-free V102 mutant channels are not Ca2+-selective, their Ca2+ selectivity is dose-dependently boosted by interactions with STIM1. Similar enhancement of Ca2+ selectivity is also seen in wild-type ORAI1 channels by increasing the number of STIM1 activation domains that are directly tethered to ORAI1 channels, or by increasing the relative expression of full-length STIM1. Thus, exquisite Ca2+ selectivity is not an intrinsic property of CRAC channels but rather a tuneable feature that is bestowed on otherwise non-selective ORAI1 channels by STIM1. Our results demonstrate that STIM1-mediated gating of CRAC channels occurs through an unusual mechanism in which permeation and gating are closely coupled.","McNally, Beth A.; Somasundaram, Agila; Yamashita, Megumi; Prakriya, Murali","McNally, BA; Somasundaram, A; Yamashita, M; Prakriya, M",241.0,"[McNally, Beth A.; Somasundaram, Agila; Yamashita, Megumi; Prakriya, Murali] Northwestern Univ, Dept Mol Pharmacol & Biol Chem, Sch Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10752,Article,,m-prakriya@northwestern.edu,U136,NIH [NS057499]; American Heart Association,"We thank C.

85,73,374.0,"One motivation in the study of development is the discovery of mechanisms that may guide evolutionary change. Here we report how development governs relative size and number of cheek teeth, or molars, in the mouse. We constructed an inhibitory cascade model by experimentally uncovering the activator-inhibitor logic of sequential tooth development. The inhibitory cascade acts as a ratchet that determines molar size differences along the jaw, one effect being that the second molar always makes up one-third of total molar area. By using a macroevolutionary test, we demonstrate the success of the model in predicting dentition patterns found among murine rodent species with various diets, thereby providing an example of ecologically driven evolution along a developmentally favoured trajectory. In general, our work demonstrates how to construct and test developmental rules with evolutionary predictability in natural systems.","Kavanagh, Kathryn D.; Evans, Alistair R.; Jernvall, Jukka","Kavanagh, KD; Evans, AR; Jernvall, J",427.0,"SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; Univ Helsinki, Inst Biotechnol, Evolut & Dev Unit, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06153,Article,,kathryn_kavanagh@yahoo.com; jernvall@fastmail.fm,U1,,,214GQ,,,EXPRESSION PATTERNS; TOOTH DEVELOPMENT; GENETIC-BASIS; LIFE-HISTORY; MOLAR TEETH; REDUCTION; MOUSE; DIFFERENTIATION; DENTITIONS; GROWTH,7161.0,NATURE,Nature,English,50.0,No,"Evans, Alistair/0000-0002-4078-4693","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",27-Sep,7.0,LONDON,17898761.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007.0,"Evans, Alistair/D-4239-2011","Kavanagh, KD (reprint author), SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,167.0,Predicting evolutionary patterns of mammalian teeth from development,11.0,53.0,WOS:000249724800033,374.0,449,Multidisciplinary Sciences,171,jukka,jernvall,8085.0,62,male,1.0,o2NAG70AAAAJ,3,"(4126, 9345]",28649402,1,28649402,1,Jukka Jernvall,Jukka Jernvall,1,1
86,149,195.0,"Gut commensal microbes shape the mucosal immune system by regulating the differentiation and expansion of several types of T cell(1-5). Clostridia, a dominant class of commensal microbe, can induce colonic regulatory T (T-reg) cells, which have a central role in the suppression of inflammatory and allergic responses(3). However, the molecular mechanisms by which commensal microbes induce colonic T-reg cells have been unclear. Here we show that a large bowel microbial fermentation product, butyrate, induces the differentiation of colonic T-reg cells in mice. A comparative NMR-based metabolome analysis suggests that the luminal concentrations of short-chain fatty acids positively correlates with the number of T-reg cells in the colon. Among short-chain fatty acids, butyrate induced the differentiation of T-reg cells in vitro and in vivo, and ameliorated the development of colitis induced by adoptive transfer of CD4(+) CD45RB(hi) T cells in Rag1(-/-) mice. Treatment of naive T cells under the T-reg-cell-polarizing conditions with butyrate enhanced histone H3 acetylation in the promoter and conserved non-coding sequence regions of the Foxp3 locus, suggesting a possible mechanism for how microbial-derived butyrate regulates the differentiation of T-reg cells. Our findings provide new insight into the mechanisms by which host-microbe interactions establish immunological homeostasis in the gut.","Furusawa, Yukihiro; Obata, Yuuki; Fukuda, Shinji; Endo, Takaho A.; Nakato, Gaku; Takahashi, Daisuke; Nakanishi, Yumiko; Uetake, Chikako; Kato, Keiko; Kato, Tamotsu; Takahashi, Masumi; Fukuda, Noriko N.; Murakami, Shinnosuke; Miyauchi, Eiji; Hino, Shingo; Atarashi, Koji; Onawa, Satoshi; Fujimura, Yumiko; Lockett, Trevor; Clarke, Julie M.; Topping, David L.; Tomita, Masaru; Hori, Shohei; Ohara, Osamu; Morita, Tatsuya; Koseki, Haruhiko; Kikuchi, Jun; Honda, Kenya; Hase, Koji; Ohno, Hiroshi","Furusawa, Y; Obata, Y; Fukuda, S; Endo, TA; Nakato, G; Takahashi, D; Nakanishi, Y; Uetake, C; Kato, K; Kato, T; Takahashi, M; Fukuda, NN; Murakami, S; Miyauchi, E; Hino, S; Atarashi, K; Onawa, S; Fujimura, Y; Lockett, T; Clarke, JM; Topping, DL; Tomita, M; Hori, S; Ohara, O; Morita, T; Koseki, H; Kikuchi, J; Honda, K; Hase, K; Ohno, H",446.0,"[Furusawa, Yukihiro; Obata, Yuuki; Fukuda, Shinji; Endo, Takaho A.; Nakato, Gaku; Takahashi, Daisuke; Uetake, Chikako; Kato, Keiko; Kato, Tamotsu; Takahashi, Masumi; Miyauchi, Eiji; Atarashi, Koji; Onawa, Satoshi; Hori, Shohei; Ohara, Osamu; Koseki, Haruhiko; Honda, Kenya; Hase, Koji; Ohno, Hiroshi] RIKEN Ctr Integrat Med Sci IMS RCAI, Wako, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Furusawa, Yukihiro; Obata, Yuuki; Fujimura, Yumiko; Hase, Koji] Univ Tokyo, Inst Med Sci, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; [Obata, Yuuki; Koseki, Haruhiko; Ohno, Hiroshi] Chiba Univ, Grad Sch Med, Chiba 2608670, Japan; [Fukuda, Shinji; Nakanishi, Yumiko; Fukuda, Noriko N.; Murakami, Shinnosuke; Tomita, Masaru] Keio Univ, Inst Adv Biosci, Yamagata 9970052, Japan; [Kato, Keiko; Koseki, Haruhiko; Kikuchi, Jun] Yokohama City Univ, Grad Sch Med Life Sci, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Hino, Shingo] Shizuoka Univ, Fac Agr, Shizuoka 4228529, Japan; [Atarashi, Koji; Hase, Koji] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, PRESTO, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; [Lockett, Trevor; Clarke, Julie M.; Topping, David L.] CSIRO Food & Nutr Sci, Preventat Hlth Natl Res Flagship, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia; [Kikuchi, Jun] RIKEN Ctr Sustainable Resource Sci, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Honda, Kenya] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, CREST, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12721,Article,1476-4687,sfukuda@sfc.keio.ac.jp; hase@ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp; ohno@rcai.riken.jp,+,"Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology [24117524, 21022049, 20113003]; The Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [24890293, 252667, 24380072, 24658129, 22689017, 21390155]; The Japan Science and Technology Agency; RIKEN; RIKEN RCAI Young Chief Investigator program; Institute for Fermentation, Osaka; Mishima Kaiun Memorial Foundation; The Takeda Science Foundation; The Mitsubishi Foundation; The Uehara Memorial Foundation","We would like to thank P.

87,167,100.0,"An important challenge in geomorphology is the reconciliation of the high fluvial incision rates observed in tectonically active mountain ranges with the long-term preservation of significant mountain-range relief in ancient, tectonically inactive orogenic belts(1-3). River bedrock erosion and sediment transport are widely recognized to be the principal controls on the lifespan of mountain ranges. But the factors controlling the rate of erosion(4-8) and the reasons why they seem to vary significantly as a function of tectonic activity remain controversial. Here we use computational simulations to show that the key to understanding variations in the rate of erosion between tectonically active and inactive mountain ranges may relate to a bidirectional coupling between bedrock river incision and landslides. Whereas fluvial incision steepens surrounding hillslopes and increases landslide frequency(9), landsliding affects fluvial erosion rates in two fundamentally distinct ways. On the one hand, large landslides overwhelm the river transport capacity and cause upstream build up of sediment that protects the river bed from further erosion(9-11). On the other hand, in delivering abrasive agents to the streams(4-6), landslides help accelerate fluvial erosion. Our models illustrate how this coupling has fundamentally different implications for rates of fluvial incision in active and inactive mountain ranges. The coupling there-fore provides a plausible physical explanation for the preservation of significant mountain-range relief in old orogenic belts, up to several hundred million years after tectonic activity has effectively ceased.","Egholm, David L.; Knudsen, Mads F.; Sandiford, Mike","Egholm, DL; Knudsen, MF; Sandiford, M",475.0,"[Egholm, David L.; Knudsen, Mads F.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Geosci, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Sandiford, Mike] Univ Melbourne, Sch Earth Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12218,Article,,david@geo.au.dk,+,Danish Council for Independent Research under the Sapere Aude programme; Carlsberg Foundation; Villum Foundation; ARC [DP110104098]; AISRF,D.

88,236,404.0,"Activation of microglia and inflammation-mediated neurotoxicity are suggested to play a decisive role in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders. Activated microglia release pro-inflammatory factors that may be neurotoxic. Here we show that the orderly activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3/7, known executioners of apoptotic cell death, regulate microglia activation through a protein kinase C (PKC)-delta-dependent pathway. We find that stimulation of microglia with various inflammogens activates caspase-8 and caspase-3/7 in microglia without triggering cell death in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown or chemical inhibition of each of these caspases hindered microglia activation and consequently reduced neurotoxicity. We observe that these caspases are activated in microglia in the ventral mesencephalon of Parkinson's disease (PD) and the frontal cortex of individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Taken together, we show that caspase-8 and caspase-3/7 are involved in regulating microglia activation. We conclude that inhibition of these caspases could be neuroprotective by targeting the microglia rather than the neurons themselves.","Burguillos, Miguel A.; Deierborg, Tomas; Kavanagh, Edel; Persson, Annette; Hajji, Nabil; Garcia-Quintanilla, Albert; Cano, Josefina; Brundin, Patrik; Englund, Elisabet; Venero, Jose L.; Joseph, Bertrand","Burguillos, MA; Deierborg, T; Kavanagh, E; Persson, A; Hajji, N; Garcia-Quintanilla, A; Cano, J; Brundin, P; Englund, E; Venero, JL; Joseph, B",319.0,"[Burguillos, Miguel A.; Kavanagh, Edel; Hajji, Nabil; Joseph, Bertrand] Karolinska Inst, Dept Oncol Pathol, Canc Ctr Karolinska, S-17176 Stockholm, Sweden; [Burguillos, Miguel A.; Cano, Josefina; Venero, Jose L.] Univ Seville, Dept Bioquim & Biol Mol, Fac Farm, E-41012 Seville, Spain; [Burguillos, Miguel A.; Cano, Josefina; Venero, Jose L.] Inst Biomed Sevilla, Seville 41012, Spain; [Burguillos, Miguel A.; Deierborg, Tomas; Brundin, Patrik] Wallenberg Neurosci Ctr, Dept Expt Med Sci, Neuronal Survival Unit, S-22184 Lund, Sweden; [Persson, Annette; Englund, Elisabet] Univ Lund Hosp, Div Neuropathol, Dept Pathol, S-22185 Lund, Sweden; [Garcia-Quintanilla, Albert] Univ Seville, Serv Biol, CITIUS, Ctr Invest Tecnol & Innovac, E-41012 Seville, Spain",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09788,Article,1476-4687,jlvenero@us.es; bertrand.joseph@ki.se,U214,"Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnologia [SAF2006-04119, 2009-13778]; Swedish Research Council; Parkinson Foundation of Sweden; Swedish Alzheimer Foundation; Swedish Cancer Society","We thank A.

89,188,240.0,"The principle(1) that 'popularity is attractive' underlies preferential attachment(2), which is a common explanation for the emergence of scaling in growing networks. If new connections are made preferentially to more popular nodes, then the resulting distribution of the number of connections possessed by nodes follows power laws(3,4), as observed in many real networks(5,6). Preferential attachment has been directly validated for some real networks (including the Internet(7,8)), and can be a consequence of different underlying processes based on node fitness, ranking, optimization, random walks or duplication(9-16). Here we show that popularity is just one dimension of attractiveness; another dimension is similarity(17-24). We develop a framework in which new connections optimize certain trade-offs between popularity and similarity, instead of simply preferring popular nodes. The framework has a geometric interpretation in which popularity preference emerges from local optimization. As opposed to preferential attachment, our optimization framework accurately describes the large-scale evolution of technological (the Internet), social (trust relationships between people) and biological (Escherichia coli metabolic) networks, predicting the probability of new links with high precision. The framework that we have developed can thus be used for predicting new links in evolving networks, and provides a different perspective on preferential attachment as an emergent phenomenon.","Papadopoulos, Fragkiskos; Kitsak, Maksim; Angeles Serrano, M.; Boguna, Marian; Krioukov, Dmitri","Papadopoulos, F; Kitsak, M; Serrano, MA; Boguna, M; Krioukov, D",537.0,"[Papadopoulos, Fragkiskos] Cyprus Univ Technol, Dept Elect Engn Comp Engn & Informat, CY-3036 Limassol, Cyprus; [Kitsak, Maksim; Krioukov, Dmitri] Univ Calif San Diego, CAIDA, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Angeles Serrano, M.; Boguna, Marian] Univ Barcelona, Dept Fis Fonamental, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11459,Article,,f.papadopoulos@cut.ac.cy; dima@ucsd.edu,540,"Marie Curie International Reintegration Grant within the 7th European Community Framework Programme; MICINN [FIS2010-21781-C02-02, BFU2010-21847-C02-02]; Generalitat de Catalunya [2009SGR838]; Ramon y Cajal programme of the Spanish Ministry of Science; ICREA Academia; Generalitat de Catalunya; NSF [CNS-0964236, CNS-1039646, CNS-0722070]; DHS [N66001-08-C-2029]; DARPA [HR0011-12-1-0012]; Cisco Systems","We thank C.

90,51,285.0,"Malaria parasites and related Apicomplexans are the causative agents of the some of the most serious infectious diseases of humans, companion animals, livestock and wildlife. These parasites must undergo sexual reproduction to transmit from vertebrate hosts to vectors, and their sex ratios are consistently female- biased. Sex allocation theory, a cornerstone of evolutionary biology, is remarkably successful at explaining female- biased sex ratios in multicellular taxa, but has proved controversial when applied to malaria parasites. Here we show that, as predicted by theory, sex ratio is an important fitness- determining trait and Plasmodium chabaudi parasites adjust their sex allocation in response to the presence of unrelated conspecifics. This suggests that P. chabaudi parasites use kin discrimination to evaluate the genetic diversity of their infections, and they adjust their behaviour in response to environmental cues. Malaria parasites provide a novel way to test evolutionary theory, and support the generality and power of a darwinian approach.","Reece, Sarah E.; Drew, Damien R.; Gardner, Andy","Reece, SE; Drew, DR; Gardner, A",609.0,"[Reece, Sarah E.; Gardner, Andy] Univ Edinburgh, Inst Evolut Biol, Ashworth Labs, Sch Biol Sci, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland; [Reece, Sarah E.; Drew, Damien R.] Univ Edinburgh, Inst Immunol & Infect Res, Ashworth Labs, Sch Biol Sci, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland; [Drew, Damien R.] Walter & Eliza Hall Inst Med Res, Ctr Biotechnol, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06954,Article,1476-4687,sarah.reece@ed.ac.uk,U1,Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council; Wellcome Trust,,305NN,,,LOCAL MATE COMPETITION; PLASMODIUM-FALCIPARUM; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; TOXOPLASMA-GONDII; BLOOD PARASITES; PREMATURE REJECTION; FERTILITY INSURANCE; EVOLUTION; VIRULENCE; TRANSMISSION,7195.0,NATURE,Nature,English,50.0,No,"Reece, Sarah/0000-0001-6716-6732; Gardner, Andy/0000-0002-1304-3734","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",29-May,7.0,LONDON,18509435.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,"Reece, Sarah/C-9447-2009; Gardner, Andy/K-5353-2013","Reece, SE (reprint author), Univ Edinburgh, Inst Evolut Biol, Ashworth Labs, Sch Biol Sci, W Mains Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,117.0,Sex ratio adjustment and kin discrimination in malaria parasites,1.0,32.0,WOS:000256185200034,285.0,453,Multidisciplinary Sciences,121,andy,gardner,9271.0,3139,male,0.95,WQrZYMIAAAAJ,3,"(4126, 9345]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
91,143,35.0,"Intermittent intense ultraviolet (UV) exposure represents an important aetiological factor in the development of malignant melanoma(1). The ability of UV radiation to cause tumour-initiating DNA mutations in melanocytes is now firmly established(2), but how the microenvironmental effects of UV radiation(3,4) influence melanoma pathogenesis is not fully understood. Here we report that repetitive UV exposure of primary cutaneous melanomas in a genetically engineered mouse model(5) promotes metastatic progression, independent of its tumour-initiating effects. UV irradiation enhanced the expansion of tumour cells along abluminal blood vessel surfaces and increased the number of lung metastases. This effect depended on the recruitment and activation of neutrophils, initiated by the release of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) from UV-damaged epidermal keratinocytes and driven by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). The UV-induced neutrophilic inflammatory response stimulated angiogenesis and promoted the ability of melanoma cells to migrate towards endothelial cells and use selective motility cues on their surfaces. Our results not only reveal how UV irradiation of epidermal keratinocytes is sensed by the innate immune system, but also show that the resulting inflammatory response catalyses reciprocal melanoma-endothelial cell interactions leading to perivascular invasion, a phenomenon originally described as angiotropism in human melanomas by histopathologists(6). Angiotropism represents a hitherto underappreciated mechanism of metastasis(7) that also increases the likelihood of intravasation and haematogenous dissemination. Consistent with our findings, ulcerated primary human melanomas with abundant neutrophils and reactive angiogenesis frequently show angiotropism and a high risk for metastases. Our work indicates that targeting the inflammation-induced phenotypic plasticity of melanoma cells and their association with endothelial cells represent rational strategies to specifically interfere with metastatic progression.","Bald, Tobias; Quast, Thomas; Landsberg, Jennifer; Rogava, Meri; Glodde, Nicole; Lopez-Ramos, Dorys; Kohlmeyer, Judith; Riesenberg, Stefanie; van den Boorn-Konijnenberg, Debby; Hoemig-Hoelzel, Cornelia; Reuten, Raphael; Schadow, Benjamin; Weighardt, Heike; Wenzel, Daniela; Helfrich, Iris; Schadendorf, Dirk; Bloch, Wilhelm; Bianchi, Marco E.; Lugassy, Claire; Barnhill, Raymond L.; Koch, Manuel; Fleischmann, Bernd K.; Foerster, Irmgard; Kastenmueller, Wolfgang; Kolanus, Waldemar; Hoelzel, Michael; Gaffal, Evelyn; Tueting, Thomas","Bald, T; Quast, T; Landsberg, J; Rogava, M; Glodde, N; Lopez-Ramos, D; Kohlmeyer, J; Riesenberg, S; van den Boorn-Konijnenberg, D; Homig-Holzel, C; Reuten, R; Schadow, B; Weighardt, H; Wenzel, D; Helfrich, I; Schadendorf, D; Bloch, W; Bianchi, ME; Lugassy, C; Barnhill, RL; Koch, M; Fleischmann, BK; Forster, I; Kastenmuller, W; Kolanus, W; Holzel, M; Gaffal, E; Tuting, T",109.0,"[Bald, Tobias; Landsberg, Jennifer; Rogava, Meri; Glodde, Nicole; Lopez-Ramos, Dorys; Kohlmeyer, Judith; Gaffal, Evelyn; Tueting, Thomas] Univ Bonn, Dept Dermatol & Allergy, Lab Expt Dermatol, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Quast, Thomas; Schadow, Benjamin; Weighardt, Heike; Foerster, Irmgard; Kolanus, Waldemar] Univ Bonn, Life & Med Sci Inst, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Riesenberg, Stefanie; van den Boorn-Konijnenberg, Debby; Hoemig-Hoelzel, Cornelia; Hoelzel, Michael] Univ Bonn, Dept Clin Chem & Clin Pharmacol, Unit RNA Biol, D-53105 Bonn, Germany; [Reuten, Raphael; Koch, Manuel] Univ Cologne, Inst Dent Res & Oral Musculoskeletal Biol, Fac Med, Ctr Biochem, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; [Wenzel, Daniela; Fleischmann, Bernd K.] Univ Bonn, Life & Brain Ctr, Inst Physiol 1, D-53105 Bonn, Germany; [Helfrich, Iris; Schadendorf, Dirk] Univ Hosp Essen, Dept Dermatol, D-45122 Essen, Germany; [Bloch, Wilhelm] German Sport Univ Cologne, Inst Cardiovasc Res & Sport Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Sport Med, D-50933 Cologne, Germany; [Bianchi, Marco E.] San Raffaele Univ & Sci Inst, Div Genet & Cell Biol, I-20132 Milan, Italy; [Lugassy, Claire; Barnhill, Raymond L.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Med Ctr, Jonsson Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Kastenmueller, Wolfgang] Univ Bonn, Inst Mol Med & Expt Immunol, D-53105 Bonn, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13111,Article,1476-4687,michael.hoelzel@ukb.uni-bonn.de; evelyn.gaffal@ukb.uni-bonn.de; thomas.tueting@ukb.uni-bonn.de,+,"Deutsche Krebshilfe P9 in the Melanoma Research Network; DFG [SFB832, SFB704, HO 4281/2-1, SFB829, SFB829 Z2]; BONFOR; NRW junior research group; Jurgen Manchot Stiftung; AIRC","We would like to thank the following individuals for their support: G.

92,45,109.0,"Since the completion of the genome sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in 1996 (refs 1, 2), there has been a large increase in complete genome sequences, accompanied by great advances in our understanding of genome evolution. Although little is known about the natural and life histories of yeasts in the wild, there are an increasing number of studies looking at ecological and geographic distributions(3,4), population structure(5-8) and sexual versus asexual reproduction(9,10). Less well understood at the whole genome level are the evolutionary processes acting within populations and species that lead to adaptation to different environments, phenotypic differences and reproductive isolation. Here we present one- to fourfold or more coverage of the genome sequences of over seventy isolates of the baker's yeast S. cerevisiae and its closest relative, Saccharomyces paradoxus. We examine variation in gene content, single nucleotide polymorphisms, nucleotide insertions and deletions, copy numbers and transposable elements. We find that phenotypic variation broadly correlates with global genome-wide phylogenetic relationships. S. paradoxus populations are well delineated along geographic boundaries, whereas the variation among worldwide S. cerevisiae isolates shows less differentiation and is comparable to a single S. paradoxus population. Rather than one or two domestication events leading to the extant baker's yeasts, the population structure of S. cerevisiae consists of a few well-defined, geographically isolated lineages and many different mosaics of these lineages, supporting the idea that human influence provided the opportunity for cross-breeding and production of new combinations of pre-existing variations.","Liti, Gianni; Carter, David M.; Moses, Alan M.; Warringer, Jonas; Parts, Leopold; James, Stephen A.; Davey, Robert P.; Roberts, Ian N.; Burt, Austin; Koufopanou, Vassiliki; Tsai, Isheng J.; Bergman, Casey M.; Bensasson, Douda; O'Kelly, Michael J.

93,115,215.0,"The fast growth of information technology has been sustained by continuous scaling down of the silicon-based metal-oxide field-effect transistor. However, such technology faces two major challenges to further scaling. First, the device electrostatics (the ability of the transistor's gate electrode to control its channel potential) are degraded when the channel length is decreased, using conventional bulk materials such as silicon as the channel. Recently, two-dimensional semiconducting materials(1-7) have emerged as promising candidates to replace silicon, as they can maintain excellent device electrostatics even at much reduced channel lengths. The second, more severe, challenge is that the supply voltage can no longer be scaled down by the same factor as the transistor dimensions because of the fundamental thermionic limitation of the steepness of turn-on characteristics, or subthreshold swing(8,9). To enable scaling to continue without a power penalty, a different transistor mechanism is required to obtain subthermionic subthreshold swing, such as band-to-band tunnelling(10-16). Here we demonstrate band-to-band tunnel field-effect transistors (tunnelFETs), based on a two-dimensional semiconductor, that exhibit steep turn-on; subthreshold swing is a minimum of 3.9 millivolts per decade and an average of 31.1 millivolts per decade for four decades of drain current at room temperature. By using highly doped germanium as the source and atomically thin molybdenum disulfide as the channel, a vertical heterostructure is built with excellent electrostatics, a strain-free heterointerface, a lowtunnelling barrier, and a large tunnelling area. Our atomically thin and layered semiconducting-channel tunnel-FET(ATLAS-TFET) is the only planar architecture tunnel-FET to achieve subthermionic subthreshold swing over four decades of drain current, as recommended in ref. 17, and is also the only tunnel-FET(inany architecture) to achieve this at a low power-supply voltage of 0.1 volts. Our device is at present the thinnest-channel subthermionic transistor, and has the potential to open up new avenues for ultra-dense and low-power integrated circuits, as well as for ultra-sensitive biosensors and gas sensors(18-21).","Sarkar, Deblina; Xie, Xuejun; Liu, Wei; Cao, Wei; Kang, Jiahao; Gong, Yongji; Kraemer, Stephan; Ajayan, Pulickel M.; Banerjee, Kaustav","Sarkar, D; Xie, XJ; Liu, W; Cao, W; Kang, JH; Gong, YJ; Kraemer, S; Ajayan, PM; Banerjee, K",91.0,"[Sarkar, Deblina; Xie, Xuejun; Liu, Wei; Cao, Wei; Kang, Jiahao; Banerjee, Kaustav] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Gong, Yongji; Ajayan, Pulickel M.] Rice Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Nanoengn, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Kraemer, Stephan] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Mat, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15387,Article,1476-4687,kaustav@ece.ucsb.edu,95,Air Force Office of Scientific Research [FA9550-14-1-0268]; US NSF [CCF-1162633]; Army Research Office (MURI) [W911NF-11-1-0362]; MRSEC Program of the NSF [DMR1121053]; NSF-funded Materials Research Facilities Network,"This work was supported by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (grant FA9550-14-1-0268) and the US NSF (grant CCF-1162633).

94,80,224.0,"Morphogens act in developing tissues to control the spatial arrangement of cellular differentiation(1,2). The activity of a morphogen has generally been viewed as a concentration-dependent response to a diffusible signal, but the duration of morphogen signalling can also affect cellular responses(3). One such example is the morphogen sonic hedgehog (SHH). In the vertebrate central nervous system and limbs, the pattern of cellular differentiation is controlled by both the amount and the time of SHH exposure(4-7). How these two parameters are interpreted at a cellular level has been unclear. Here we provide evidence that changing the concentration or duration of SHH has an equivalent effect on intracellular signalling. Chick neural cells convert different concentrations of SHH into time-limited periods of signal transduction, such that signal duration is proportional to SHH concentration. This depends on the gradual desensitization of cells to ongoing SHH exposure, mediated by the SHH-dependent upregulation of patched 1 (PTC1), a ligand-binding inhibitor of SHH signalling(8). Thus, in addition to its role in shaping the SHH gradient(8-10), PTC1 participates cell autonomously in gradient sensing. Together, the data reveal a novel strategy for morphogen interpretation, in which the temporal adaptation of cells to a morphogen integrates the concentration and duration of a signal to control differential gene expression.","Dessaud, Eric; Yang, Lin Lin; Hill, Katy; Cox, Barny; Ulloa, Fausto; Ribeiro, Ana; Mynett, Anita; Novitch, Bennett G.; Briscoe, James","Dessaud, E; Yang, LL; Hill, K; Cox, B; Ulloa, F; Ribeiro, A; Mynett, A; Novitch, BG; Briscoe, J",717.0,"Natl Inst Med Res, London NW7 1AA, England; Univ Michigan, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06347,Article,1476-4687,james.briscoe@nimr.mrc.ac.uk,U7,Medical Research Council [MC_U117560541]; NINDS NIH HHS [R01 NS072804],,235BY,,,PROGENITOR-CELL IDENTITY; VENTRAL NEURAL-TUBE; NEURONAL FATE; FLOOR PLATE; TRANSDUCTION; SPECIFICATION; INDUCTION; GENE; PATHWAY; PATTERN,7170.0,NATURE,Nature,English,33.0,No,"Novitch, Bennett/0000-0002-2696-3708; Dessaud, Eric/0000-0001-9723-6658; Briscoe, James/0000-0002-1020-5240","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",29-Nov,5.0,LONDON,18046410.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007.0,,"Briscoe, J (reprint author), Natl Inst Med Res, Mill Hill, London NW7 1AA, England.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,256.0,Interpretation of the sonic hedgehog morphogen gradient by a temporal adaptation mechanism,0.0,16.0,WOS:000251209700053,224.0,450,Multidisciplinary Sciences,258,james,briscoe,14198.0,6359,male,0.99,VJ83sekAAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",45465524,1,28802773,1,Jim Briscoe,Jim Briscoe,1,1
95,25,113.0,"Although pioneered by human geneticists as a potential solution to the challenging problem of finding the genetic basis of common human diseases(1,2), genome-wide association (GWA) studies have, owing to advances in genotyping and sequencing technology, become an obvious general approach for studying the genetics of natural variation and traits of agricultural importance. They are particularly useful when inbred lines are available, because once these lines have been genotyped they can be phenotyped multiple times, making it possible (as well as extremely cost effective) to study many different traits in many different environments, while replicating the phenotypic measurements to reduce environmental noise. Here we demonstrate the power of this approach by carrying out a GWA study of 107 phenotypes in Arabidopsis thaliana, a widely distributed, predominantly self-fertilizing model plant known to harbour considerable genetic variation for many adaptively important traits(3). Our results are dramatically different from those of human GWA studies, in that we identify many common alleles of major effect, but they are also, in many cases, harder to interpret because confounding by complex genetics and population structure make it difficult to distinguish true associations from false. However, a-priori candidates are significantly over-represented among these associations as well, making many of them excellent candidates for follow-up experiments. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of GWA studies in A. thaliana and suggests that the approach will be appropriate for many other organisms.","Atwell, Susanna; Huang, Yu S.; Vilhjalmsson, Bjarni J.; Willems, Glenda; Horton, Matthew; Li, Yan; Meng, Dazhe; Platt, Alexander; Tarone, Aaron M.; Hu, Tina T.; Jiang, Rong; Muliyati, N.

Here we report the crystal structure of IKK beta in complex with an inhibitor, at a resolution of 3.6 angstrom. The structure reveals a trimodular architecture comprising the kinase domain, a ubiquitin-like domain (ULD) and an elongated, alpha-helical scaffold/dimerization domain (SDD). Unexpectedly, the predicted leucine zipper and helix-loop-helix motifs do not form these structures but are part of the SDD. The ULD and SDD mediate a critical interaction with I kappa B alpha that restricts substrate specificity, and the ULD is also required for catalytic activity. The SDD mediates IKK beta dimerization, but dimerization per se is not important for maintaining IKK beta activity and instead is required for IKK beta activation. Other IKK family members, IKK alpha, TBK1 and IKK-i, may have a similar trimodular architecture and function.","Xu, Guozhou; Lo, Yu-Chih; Li, Qiubai; Napolitano, Gennaro; Wu, Xuefeng; Jiang, Xuliang; Dreano, Michel; Karin, Michael; Wu, Hao","Xu, GZ; Lo, YC; Li, QB; Napolitano, G; Wu, XF; Jiang, XL; Dreano, M; Karin, M; Wu, H",325.0,"[Xu, Guozhou; Lo, Yu-Chih; Li, Qiubai; Wu, Hao] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Biochem, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Napolitano, Gennaro; Wu, Xuefeng; Karin, Michael] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Pharmacol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Jiang, Xuliang] EMD Serono Res Inst, Billerica, MA 01821 USA; [Dreano, Michel] Merck Serono, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09853,Article,,haowu@med.cornell.edu,U222,National Institutes of Health; American Heart Association; Cancer Research Institute; American Cancer Society,"We thank K.

97,41,48.0,"Dopamine signalling regulates a variety of complex behaviours, and defects in dopamine neuron function or survival result in severe human pathologies, such as Parkinson's disease(1). The common denominator of all dopamine neurons is the expression of dopamine pathway genes, which code for a set of phylogenetically conserved proteins involved in dopamine synthesis and transport. Gene regulatory mechanisms that result in the direct activation of dopamine pathway genes and thereby ultimately determine the identity of dopamine neurons are poorly understood in all systems studied so far(2). Here we show that a simple cis-regulatory element, the dopamine (DA) motif, controls the expression of all dopamine pathway genes in all dopaminergic cell types in Caenorhabditis elegans. The DA motif is activated by the ETS transcription factor AST-1. Loss of ast-1 results in the failure of all distinct dopaminergic neuronal subtypes to terminally differentiate. Ectopic expression of ast-1 is sufficient to activate the dopamine pathway in some cellular contexts. Vertebrate dopamine pathway genes also contain phylogenetically conserved DA motifs that can be activated by the mouse ETS transcription factor Etv1 (also known as ER81), and a specific class of dopamine neurons fails to differentiate in mice lacking Etv1. Moreover, ectopic Etv1 expression induces dopaminergic fate marker expression in neuronal primary cultures. Mouse Etv1 can also functionally substitute for ast-1 in C. elegans. Our studies reveal a simple and apparently conserved regulatory logic of dopamine neuron terminal differentiation and may provide new entry points into the diagnosis or therapy of conditions in which dopamine neurons are defective.","Flames, Nuria; Hobert, Oliver","Flames, N; Hobert, O",885.0,"[Flames, Nuria; Hobert, Oliver] Columbia Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, Med Ctr, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10032 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07929,Article,,nf2171@columbia.edu; or38@columbia.edu,U7,"National Institutes of Health [R01NS039996-05, R01NS050266-03]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; EMBO; Marie Curie Outgoing International fellowship","We thank Q.

98,184,32.0,"The ventral tegmental area (VTA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) are essential for learning about environmental stimuli associated with motivationally relevant outcomes. The task of signalling such events, both rewarding and aversive, from the VTA to the NAc has largely been ascribed to dopamine neurons(1-3). The VTA also contains GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid)-releasing neurons, which provide local inhibition(4,5) and also project to the NAc6,7. However, the cellular targets and functional importance of this long-range inhibitory projection have not been ascertained. Here we show that GABA-releasing neurons of the VTA that project to the NAc (VTA GABA projection neurons) inhibit accumbal cholinergic interneurons (CINs) to enhance stimulus-outcome learning. Combining optogenetics with structural imaging and electrophysiology, we found that VTA GABA projection neurons selectively target NAc CINs, forming multiple symmetrical synaptic contacts that generated inhibitory postsynaptic currents. This is remarkable considering that CINs represent a very small population of all accumbal neurons, and provide the primary source of cholinergic tone in the NAc. Brief activation of this projection was sufficient to halt the spontaneous activity of NAc CINs, resembling the pause recorded in animals learning stimulus-outcome associations(8-12). Indeed, we found that forcing CINs to pause in behaving mice enhanced discrimination of a motivationally important stimulus that had been associated with an aversive outcome. Our results demonstrate that VTA GABA projection neurons, through their selective targeting of accumbal CINs, provide a novel route through which the VTA communicates saliency to the NAc. VTA GABA projection neurons thus emerge as orchestrators of dopaminergic and cholinergic modulation in the NAc.","Brown, Matthew T.

99,171,196.0,"Conventional semiconductor laser emission relies on stimulated emission of photons(1,2), which sets stringent requirements on the minimum amount of energy necessary for its operation(3,4). In comparison, exciton-polaritons in strongly coupled quantum well microcavities(5) can undergo stimulated scattering that promises more energy-efficient generation of coherent light by 'polariton lasers'(3,6). Polariton laser operation has been demonstrated in optically pumped semiconductor microcavities at temperatures up to room temperature(7-12), and such lasers can outperform their weak-coupling counterparts in that they have a lower threshold density(12,13). Even though polariton diodes have been realized(14-16), electrically pumped polariton laser operation, which is essential for practical applications, has not been achieved until now. Here we present an electrically pumped polariton laser based on a microcavity containing multiple quantum wells. To prove polariton laser emission unambiguously, we apply a magnetic field and probe the hybrid light-matter nature of the polaritons. Our results represent an important step towards the practical implementation of polaritonic light sources and electrically injected condensates, and can be extended to room-temperature operation using wide-bandgap materials.","Schneider, Christian; Rahimi-Iman, Arash; Kim, Na Young; Fischer, Julian; Savenko, Ivan G.; Amthor, Matthias; Lermer, Matthias; Wolf, Adriana; Worschech, Lukas; Kulakovskii, Vladimir D.; Shelykh, Ivan A.; Kamp, Martin; Reitzenstein, Stephan; Forchel, Alfred; Yamamoto, Yoshihisa; Hoefling, Sven","Schneider, C; Rahimi-Iman, A; Kim, NY; Fischer, J; Savenko, IG; Amthor, M; Lermer, M; Wolf, A; Worschech, L; Kulakovskii, VD; Shelykh, IA; Kamp, M; Reitzenstein, S; Forchel, A; Yamamoto, Y; Hofling, S",348.0,"[Schneider, Christian; Rahimi-Iman, Arash; Fischer, Julian; Amthor, Matthias; Lermer, Matthias; Wolf, Adriana; Worschech, Lukas; Kamp, Martin; Reitzenstein, Stephan; Forchel, Alfred; Hoefling, Sven] Univ Wurzburg, Tech Phys & Wilhelm Conrad Rontgen Res Ctr Comple, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany; [Kim, Na Young; Yamamoto, Yoshihisa] Stanford Univ, EL Ginzton Lab, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kim, Na Young] Univ Tokyo, Inst Ind Sci, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1538505, Japan; [Savenko, Ivan G.; Shelykh, Ivan A.] Univ Iceland, Inst Sci, IS-107 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Savenko, Ivan G.; Shelykh, Ivan A.] Nanyang Technol Univ, Div Phys & Appl Phys, Singapore 637371, Singapore; [Kulakovskii, Vladimir D.] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Solid State Phys, Chernogolovka 142432, Russia; [Reitzenstein, Stephan] Tech Univ Berlin, Inst Festkorperphys, D-10623 Berlin, Germany; [Yamamoto, Yoshihisa] Natl Inst Informat, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1018430, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12036,Article,1476-4687,christian.schneider@physik.uni-wuerzburg.de; sven.hoefling@physik.uni-wuerzburg.de,352,"State of Bavaria; National Science Foundation; JSPS through its FIRST programme; Eimskip foundation; 'Center of excellence in polaritonics', IRSES SPINMET project; 'Center of excellence in polaritonics', POLAPHEN project; German National Academic Foundation","This work was supported by the State of Bavaria, the National Science Foundation and by JSPS through its FIRST programme.

100,173,213.0,"Fermi liquid theory provides a remarkably powerful framework for the description of the conduction electrons in metals and their ordering phenomena, such as superconductivity, ferromagnetism, and spin-and charge-density-wave order. A different class of ordering phenomena of great interest concerns spin configurations that are topologically protected, that is, their topology can be destroyed only by forcing the average magnetization locally to zero(1). Examples of such configurations are hedgehogs (points at which all spins are either pointing inwards or outwards) and vortices. A central question concerns the nature of the metallic state in the presence of such topologically distinct spin textures. Here we report a high-pressure study of the metallic state at the border of the skyrmion lattice in MnSi, which represents a new form of magnetic order composed of topologically non-trivial vortices(2). When long-range magnetic order is suppressed under pressure, the key characteristic of the skyrmion lattice-that is, the topological Hall signal due to the emergent magnetic flux associated with the topological winding-is unaffected in sign or magnitude and becomes an important characteristic of the metallic state. The regime of the topological Hall signal in temperature, pressure and magnetic field coincides thereby with the exceptionally extended regime of a pronounced non-Fermi-liquid resistivity(3,30). The observation of this topological Hall signal in the regime of the NFL resistivity suggests empirically that spin correlations with non-trivial topological character may drive a breakdown of Fermi liquid theory in pure metals.","Ritz, R.; Halder, M.; Wagner, M.; Franz, C.; Bauer, A.; Pfleiderer, C.","Ritz, R; Halder, M; Wagner, M; Franz, C; Bauer, A; Pfleiderer, C",231.0,"[Ritz, R.; Halder, M.; Wagner, M.; Franz, C.; Bauer, A.; Pfleiderer, C.] Tech Univ Munich, Phys Dept E21, D-85748 Garching, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12023,Article,1476-4687,robert.ritz@frm2.tum.de; christian.pfleiderer@frm2.tum.de,234,"TUM Graduate School; DFG [TRR80, FOR960]; ERC-AdG [291079 TOPFIT]","We wish to thank P.

Such an environment leads to considerable intercellular variability in circuit behaviour, which can hinder functionality at the colony level. Here we engineer the synchronization of thousands of oscillating colony 'biopixels' over centimetre-length scales through the use of synergistic intercellular coupling involving quorum sensing within a colony and gas-phase redox signalling between colonies. We use this platform to construct a liquid crystal display (LCD)-like macroscopic clock that can be used to sense arsenic via modulation of the oscillatory period. Given the repertoire of sensing capabilities of bacteria such as Escherichia coli, the ability to coordinate their behaviour over large length scales sets the stage for the construction of low cost genetic biosensors that are capable of detecting heavy metals and pathogens in the field.","Prindle, Arthur; Samayoa, Phillip; Razinkov, Ivan; Danino, Tal; Tsimring, Lev S.; Hasty, Jeff","Prindle, A; Samayoa, P; Razinkov, I; Danino, T; Tsimring, LS; Hasty, J",39.0,"[Prindle, Arthur; Razinkov, Ivan; Danino, Tal; Hasty, Jeff] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Bioengn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Samayoa, Phillip; Hasty, Jeff] Univ Calif San Diego, Bioinformat Program, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Tsimring, Lev S.; Hasty, Jeff] Univ Calif San Diego, BioCircuits Inst, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Hasty, Jeff] Univ Calif San Diego, Div Biol Sci, Mol Biol Sect, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10722,Article,,hasty@bioeng.ucsd.edu,44,National Institutes of Health and General Medicine [R01GM69811]; San Diego Center for Systems Biology [P50GM085764]; DoD NDSEG; NSF; Office of Naval Research [MURI N00014-07-0741],"This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health and General Medicine (R01GM69811), the San Diego Center for Systems Biology (P50GM085764), the DoD NDSEG (A.

This is because long-term coexistence within overlapping ranges is thought to be unlikely in the absence of ecological differentiation(9). Here we challenge this widely held view by generalizing a standard model of sexual selection to include two ubiquitous features of populations with sexual selection: spatial variation in local carrying capacity, and mate-search costs in females. We show that, when these two features are combined, sexual preferences can single-handedly maintain coexistence, even when spatial variation in local carrying capacity is so slight that it might go unnoticed empirically. This theoretical study demonstrates that sexual selection alone can promote the long-term coexistence of ecologically equivalent species with overlapping ranges, and it thus provides a novel explanation for the maintenance of species diversity.","M'Gonigle, Leithen K.; Mazzucco, Rupert; Otto, Sarah P.; Dieckmann, Ulf","M'Gonigle, LK; Mazzucco, R; Otto, SP; Dieckmann, U",506.0,"[M'Gonigle, Leithen K.; Otto, Sarah P.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Mazzucco, Rupert; Dieckmann, Ulf] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Evolut & Ecol Program, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10971,Article,,mgonigle@zoology.ubc.ca,509,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (Canada); European Science Foundation; WWTF; European Commission; Austrian Science Fund; Austrian Ministry of Science and Research,"We thank J.

103,198,41.0,"The Earth acts as a gigantic heat engine driven by the decay of radiogenic isotopes and slow cooling, which gives rise to plate tectonics, volcanoes and mountain building. Another key product is the geomagnetic field, generated in the liquid iron core by a dynamo running on heat released by cooling and freezing (as the solid inner core grows), and on chemical convection (due to light elements expelled from the liquid on freezing). The power supplied to the geodynamo, measured by the heat flux across the core-mantle boundary (CMB), places constraints on Earth's evolution(1). Estimates of CMB heat flux(2-5) depend on properties of iron mixtures under the extreme pressure and temperature conditions in the core, most critically on the thermal and electrical conductivities. These quantities remain poorly known because of inherent experimental and theoretical difficulties. Here we use density functional theory to compute these conductivities in liquid iron mixtures at core conditions from first principles-unlike previous estimates, which relied on extrapolations. The mixtures of iron, oxygen, sulphur and silicon are taken from earlier work(6) and fit the seismologically determined core density and inner-core boundary density jump(7,8). We find both conductivities to be two to three times higher than estimates in current use. The changes are so large that core thermal histories and power requirements need to be reassessed. New estimates indicate that the adiabatic heat flux is 15 to 16 terawatts at the CMB, higher than present estimates of CMB heat flux based on mantle convection(1); the top of the core must be thermally stratified and any convection in the upper core must be driven by chemical convection against the adverse thermal buoyancy or lateral variations in CMB heat flow. Power for the geodynamo is greatly restricted, and future models of mantle evolution will need to incorporate a high CMB heat flux and explain the recent formation of the inner core.","Pozzo, Monica; Davies, Chris; Gubbins, David; Alfe, Dario","Pozzo, M; Davies, C; Gubbins, D; Alfe, D",355.0,"[Pozzo, Monica; Alfe, Dario] UCL, Dept Earth Sci, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Pozzo, Monica; Alfe, Dario] UCL, Thomas Young Ctr UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Davies, Chris; Gubbins, David] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Gubbins, David] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Inst Geophys & Planetary Phys, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Alfe, Dario] UCL, Dept Phys & Astron, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Alfe, Dario] UCL, London Ctr Nanotechnol, London WC1E 6BT, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11031,Article,,d.alfe@ucl.ac.uk,U99,"CSEDI from the National Science Foundation [EAR1065597]; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/H01571X/1, NE/H02462X/1]","D.G. is supported by CSEDI grant EAR1065597 from the National Science Foundation.

In conventional optical materials, the nonlinearity at light powers corresponding to single photons is negligibly weak. Here we demonstrate a medium that is nonlinear at the level of individual quanta, exhibiting strong absorption of photon pairs while remaining transparent to single photons. The quantum nonlinearity is obtained by coherently coupling slowly propagating photons(3-5) to strongly interacting atomic Rydberg states(6-12) in a cold, dense atomic gas(13,14). Our approach paves the way for quantum-byquantum control of light fields, including single-photon switching(15), all-optical deterministic quantum logic(16) and the realization of strongly correlated many-body states of light(17).","Peyronel, Thibault; Firstenberg, Ofer; Liang, Qi-Yu; Hofferberth, Sebastian; Gorshkov, Alexey V.; Pohl, Thomas; Lukin, Mikhail D.; Vuletic, Vladan","Peyronel, T; Firstenberg, O; Liang, QY; Hofferberth, S; Gorshkov, AV; Pohl, T; Lukin, MD; Vuletic, V",57.0,"[Firstenberg, Ofer; Hofferberth, Sebastian; Lukin, Mikhail D.] Harvard Univ, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Peyronel, Thibault; Firstenberg, Ofer; Liang, Qi-Yu; Hofferberth, Sebastian; Vuletic, Vladan] MIT, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Peyronel, Thibault; Firstenberg, Ofer; Liang, Qi-Yu; Hofferberth, Sebastian; Vuletic, Vladan] MIT, Elect Res Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Gorshkov, Alexey V.] CALTECH, Inst Quantum Informat & Matter, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Pohl, Thomas] Max Planck Inst Phys Komplexer Syst, D-01187 Dresden, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11361,Article,,lukin@fas.harvard.edu; vuletic@mit.edu,60,NSF; CUA; AFOSR Quantum Memories MURI; Lee A.

105,52,481.0,"Maintenance methylation of hemimethylated CpG dinucleotides at DNA replication forks is the key to faithful mitotic inheritance of genomic methylation patterns. UHRF1 ( ubiquitin- like, containing PHD and RING finger domains 1) is required for maintenance methylation by interacting with DNA nucleotide methyltransferase 1 ( DNMT1), the maintenance methyltransferase, and with hemi-methylated CpG, the substrate for DNMT1 ( refs 1 and 2). Here we present the crystal structure of the SET and RING- associated ( SRA) domain of mouse UHRF1 in complex with DNA containing a hemimethylated CpGsite. The DNA is contacted in both the major and minor grooves by two loops that penetrate into the middle of the DNA helix. The 5- methylcytosine has flipped completely out of the DNA helix and is positioned in a binding pocket with planar stacking contacts, Watson - Crick polar hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions specific for 5- methylcytosine. Hence, UHRF1 contains a previously unknown DNA- binding module and is the first example of a non- enzymatic, sequence- specific DNA- binding protein domain to use the base flipping mechanism to interact with DNA.","Hashimoto, Hideharu; Horton, John R.; Zhang, Xing; Bostick, Magnolia; Jacobsen, Steven E.; Cheng, Xiaodong","Hashimoto, H; Horton, JR; Zhang, X; Bostick, M; Jacobsen, SE; Cheng, XD",826.0,"[Hashimoto, Hideharu; Horton, John R.; Zhang, Xing; Cheng, Xiaodong] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Bostick, Magnolia; Jacobsen, Steven E.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Mol Cell & Dev Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Jacobsen, Steven E.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07280,Article,,xcheng@emory.edu,U14,"National Institutes of Health [GM049245, GM060398]; NIH-NSRA Fellowship [CA1263022]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Georgia Research Alliance Eminent Scholar",We thank R.

106,185,47.0,"Mechanisms of protein recognition have been extensively studied for single-domain proteins(1), but are less well characterized for dynamic multidomain systems. Ubiquitin chains represent a biologically important multidomain system that requires recognition by structurally diverse ubiquitin-interacting proteins(2,3). Ubiquitin chain conformations in isolation are often different from conformations observed in ubiquitin-interacting protein complexes, indicating either great dynamic flexibility or extensive chain remodelling upon binding. Using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer, we show that Lys 63-, Lys 48- and Met 1-linked diubiquitin exist in several distinct conformational states in solution. Lys 63- and Met 1-linked diubiquitin adopt extended 'open' and more compact 'closed' conformations, and ubiquitin-binding domains and deubiquitinases (DUBs) select pre-existing conformations. By contrast, Lys 48-linked diubiquitin adopts predominantly compact conformations. DUBs directly recognize existing conformations, but may also remodel ubiquitin chains to hydrolyse the isopeptide bond. Disruption of the Lys 48-diubiquitin interface changes conformational dynamics and affects DUB activity. Hence, conformational equilibria in ubiquitin chains provide an additional layer of regulation in the ubiquitin system, and distinct conformations observed in differently linked polyubiquitin may contribute to the specificity of ubiquitin-interacting proteins.","Ye, Yu; Blaser, Georg; Horrocks, Mathew H.; Ruedas-Rama, Maria J.; Ibrahim, Shehu; Zhukov, Alexander A.; Orte, Angel; Klenerman, David; Jackson, Sophie E.; Komander, David","Ye, Y; Blaser, G; Horrocks, MH; Ruedas-Rama, MJ; Ibrahim, S; Zhukov, AA; Orte, A; Klenerman, D; Jackson, SE; Komander, D",266.0,"[Ye, Yu; Komander, David] MRC, Mol Biol Lab, Div Prot & Nucle Acids Chem, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England; [Blaser, Georg; Horrocks, Mathew H.; Ibrahim, Shehu; Zhukov, Alexander A.; Klenerman, David; Jackson, Sophie E.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Chem, Cambridge CB2 1EW, England; [Ruedas-Rama, Maria J.; Orte, Angel] Univ Granada, Fac Pharm, Dept Phys Chem, E-18071 Granada, Spain",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11722,Article,,dk10012@cam.ac.uk; sej13@cam.ac.uk; dk@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk,270,Medical Research Council [U105192732]; EMBO Young Investigator Program; BBSRC; Newton Trust; EMBO YIP small grant; EPSRC,"We would like to thank members of the Komander, Jackson and Klenerman laboratories, R.

107,132,298.0,"Seismic and geodetic observations in subduction zone forearcs indicate that slow earthquakes, including episodic tremor and slip, recur at intervals of less than six months to more than two years(1,2). In Cascadia, slow slip is segmented along strike(3) and tremor data show a gradation from large, infrequent slip episodes to small, frequent slip events with increasing depth of the plate interface(4). Observations(5-7) and models(8,9) of slow slip and tremor require the presence of near-lithostatic pore-fluid pressures in slow-earthquake source regions; however, direct evidence of factors controlling the variability in recurrence times is elusive. Here we compile seismic data from subduction zone forearcs exhibiting recurring slow earthquakes and show that the average ratio of compressional (P)-wave velocity to shear (S)-wave velocity (v(P)/v(S)) of the overlying forearc crust ranges between 1.6 and 2.0 and is linearly related to the average recurrence time of slow earthquakes. In northern Cascadia, forearc v(P)/v(S) values decrease with increasing depth of the plate interface and with decreasing tremor-episode recurrence intervals. Low v(P)/v(S) values require a large addition of quartz in a mostly mafic forearc environment(10,11). We propose that silica enrichment varying from 5 per cent to 15 per cent by volume from slab-derived fluids and upward mineralization in quartz veins(12) can explain the range of observed v(P)/v(S) values as well as the downdip decrease in v(P)/v(S). The solubility of silica depends on temperature(13), and deposition prevails near the base of the forearc crust(11). We further propose that the strong temperature dependence of healing and permeability reduction in silica-rich fault gouge via dissolution-precipitation creep(14) can explain the reduction in tremor recurrence time with progressive silica enrichment. Lower gouge permeability at higher temperatures leads to faster fluid overpressure development and low effective fault-normal stress, and therefore shorter recurrence times. Our results also agree with numerical models of slip stabilization under fault zone dilatancy strengthening(15) caused by decreasing fluid pressure as pore space increases. This implies that temperature-dependent silica deposition, permeability reduction and fluid overpressure development control dilatancy and slow-earthquake behaviour.","Audet, Pascal; Buergmann, Roland","Audet, P; Burgmann, R",389.0,"[Audet, Pascal] Univ Ottawa, Dept Earth Sci, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Buergmann, Roland] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Buergmann, Roland] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley Seismol Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13391,Article,1476-4687,pascal.audet@uottawa.ca,+,"Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (Canada); Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science (University of California, Berkeley)","Data used in this study come from the Japan Meteorological Agency, New Zealand National Seismograph Network, and the Tectonic Observatory (Caltech).

108,130,274.0,"RNA ligases have essential roles in many cellular processes in eukaryotes, archaea and bacteria, including in RNA repair(1,2) and stress-induced splicing of messenger RNA(3). In archaea and eukaryotes, RNA ligases also have a role in transfer RNA splicing to generate functional tRNAs required for protein synthesis(4-7). We recently identified the human tRNA splicing ligase, a multimeric protein complex with RTCB (also known as HSPC117, C22orf28, FAAP and D10Wsu52e) as the essential subunit(8). The functions of the additional complex components ASW (also known as C2orf49), CGI-99 (also known as C14orf166), FAM98B and the DEAD-box helicase DDX1 in the context of RNA ligation have remained unclear. Taking advantage of clusters of eukaryotic orthologous groups, here we find that archease (ARCH; also known as ZBTB8OS), a protein of unknown function, is required for full activity of the human tRNA ligase complex and, in cooperation with DDX1, facilitates the formation of an RTCB-guanylate intermediate central to mammalian RNA ligation. Our findings define a role for DDX1 in the context of the human tRNA ligase complex and suggest that the widespread co-occurrence of archease and RtcB proteins implies evolutionary conservation of their functional interplay.","Popow, Johannes; Jurkin, Jennifer; Schleiffer, Alexander; Martinez, Javier","Popow, J; Jurkin, J; Schleiffer, A; Martinez, J",104.0,"[Popow, Johannes; Jurkin, Jennifer; Martinez, Javier] Austrian Acad Sci IMBA, Inst Mol Biotechnol, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Popow, Johannes] European Mol Biol Lab, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Schleiffer, Alexander] Res Inst Mol Pathol IMP, IMP IMBA Bioinformat Core Facil, A-1030 Vienna, Austria",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13284,Article,1476-4687,javier.martinez@imba.oeaw.ac.at,U508,Fonds zur Forderung der wissenschaftlichen Forschung [P24687]; GEN-AU 3 research programme [820982]; Institute of Molecular Biotechnology of the Austrian Academy of Sciences,"We would like to thank S.

109,147,238.0,"There are two proposed explanations for ultraluminous X-ray sources(1,2) (ULXs) with luminosities in excess of 10(39) erg s(-1). They could be intermediate-mass black holes (more than 100-1,000 solar masses, M-circle dot) radiating at sub-maximal (sub-Eddington) rates, as in Galactic black-hole X-ray binaries but with larger, cooler accretion disks(3-5). Alternatively, they could be stellar-mass black holes radiating at Eddington or super-Eddington rates(2,6). On its discovery, M 101 ULX-1(4,7) had a luminosity of 3 x 10(39) erg s(-1) and a supersoft thermal disk spectrum with an exceptionally low temperature-uncomplicated by photons energized by a corona of hot electrons-more consistent with the expected appearance of an accreting intermediate-mass black hole(3,4). Here we report optical spectroscopic monitoring of M 101 ULX-1. We confirm the previous suggestion(8) that the system contains a Wolf-Rayet star, and reveal that the orbital period is 8.2 days. The black hole has a minimum mass of 5 M-circle dot, and more probably a mass of 20 M-circle dot-30 M-circle dot, but we argue that it is very unlikely to be an intermediate-mass black hole. Therefore, its exceptionally soft spectra at high Eddington ratios violate the expectations for accretion onto stellar-mass black holes(9-11). Accretion must occur from captured stellar wind, which has hitherto been thought to be so inefficient that it could not power an ultraluminous source(12,13).","Liu, Ji-Feng; Bregman, Joel N.; Bai, Yu; Justham, Stephen; Crowther, Paul","Liu, JF; Bregman, JN; Bai, Y; Justham, S; Crowther, P",500.0,"[Liu, Ji-Feng; Bai, Yu; Justham, Stephen] Chinese Acad Sci, Natl Astron Observ, Key Lab Opt Astron, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China; [Bregman, Joel N.] Univ Michigan, Dept Astron, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USA; [Crowther, Paul] Univ Sheffield, Dept Phys & Astron, Sheffield S3 7RH, S Yorkshire, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12762,Article,1476-4687,jfliu@nao.cas.cn,+,"NASA [PF6-70043]; Chinese Academy of Sciences [KJCX2-EW-T01]; National Science Foundation of China [NSFC-11273028, NSFC-11333004]","We thank J.

110,40,28.0,"Rydberg atoms have an electron in a state with a very high principal quantum number, and as a result can exhibit unusually long-range interactions. One example is the bonding of two such atoms by multipole forces to form Rydberg-Rydberg molecules with very large internuclear distances(1-3). Notably, bonding interactions can also arise from the low-energy scattering of a Rydberg electron with negative scattering length from a ground-state atom(4,5). In this case, the scattering-induced attractive interaction binds the ground-state atom to the Rydberg atom at a well-localized position within the Rydberg electron wavefunction and thereby yields giant molecules that can have internuclear separations of several thousand Bohr radii(6-8). Here we report the spectroscopic characterization of such exotic molecular states formed by rubidium Rydberg atoms that are in the spherically symmetric s state and have principal quantum numbers, n, between 34 and 40. We find that the spectra of the vibrational ground state and of the first excited state of the Rydberg molecule, the rubidium dimer Rb(5s)-Rb(ns), agree well with simple model predictions. The data allow us to extract the s-wave scattering length for scattering between the Rydberg electron and the ground-state atom, Rb(5s), in the low-energy regime (kinetic energy, <100meV), and to determine the lifetimes and the polarizabilities of the Rydberg molecules. Given our successful characterization of s-wave bound Rydberg states, we anticipate that p-wave bound states(9), trimer states(10) and bound states involving a Rydberg electron with large angular momentum-so-called trilobite molecules(5)-will also be realized and directly probed in the near future.","Bendkowsky, Vera; Butscher, Bjoern; Nipper, Johannes; Shaffer, James P.; Loew, Robert; Pfau, Tilman","Bendkowsky, V; Butscher, B; Nipper, J; Shaffer, JP; Low, R; Pfau, T",1005.0,"[Bendkowsky, Vera; Butscher, Bjoern; Nipper, Johannes; Shaffer, James P.; Loew, Robert; Pfau, Tilman] Univ Stuttgart, Phys Inst 5, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany; [Shaffer, James P.] Univ Oklahoma, Homer L Dodge Dept Phys & Astron, Norman, OK 73072 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07945,Article,,v.bendkowsky@physik.uni-stuttgart.de; t.pfau@physik.uni-stuttgart.de,U76,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [PF 381/4-1]; Landesstiftung Baden-Wurttemberg; Carl Zeiss foundation; Alexander von Humboldt foundation,"We would like to thank C.

111,109,17.0,"Eukaryotic transcription factors (TFs) are key determinants of gene activity, yet they bind only a fraction of their corresponding DNA sequence motifs in any given cell type(1). Chromatin has the potential to restrict accessibility of binding sites; however, in which context chromatin states are instructive for TF binding remains mainly unknown(1,2). To explore the contribution of DNA methylation to constrained TF binding, we mapped DNase-I-hypersensitive sites in murine stem cells in the presence and absence of DNA methylation. Methylation-restricted sites are enriched for TF motifs containing CpGs, especially for those of NRF1. In fact, the TF NRF1 occupies several thousand additional sites in the unmethylated genome, resulting in increased transcription. Restoring de novo methyltransferase activity initiates remethylation at these sites and outcompetes NRF1 binding. This suggests that binding of DNA-methylation-sensitive TFs relies on additional determinants to induce local hypomethylation. In support of this model, removal of neighbouring motifs in cis or of a TF in trans causes local hypermethylation and subsequent loss of NRF1 binding. This competition between DNA methylation and TFs in vivo reveals a case of cooperativity between TFs that acts indirectly via DNA methylation. Methylation removal by methylation-insensitive factors enables occupancy of methylation-sensitive factors, a principle that rationalizes hypomethylation of regulatory regions.","Domcke, Silvia; Bardet, Anais Flore; Ginno, Paul Adrian; Hartl, Dominik; Burger, Lukas; Schuebeler, Dirk","Domcke, S; Bardet, AF; Ginno, PA; Hartl, D; Burger, L; Schubeler, D",575.0,"[Domcke, Silvia; Bardet, Anais Flore; Ginno, Paul Adrian; Hartl, Dominik; Burger, Lukas; Schuebeler, Dirk] Friedrich Miescher Inst Biomed Res, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland; [Domcke, Silvia; Hartl, Dominik; Schuebeler, Dirk] Univ Basel, Fac Sci, CH-4003 Basel, Switzerland; [Burger, Lukas] Swiss Inst Bioinformat, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature16462,Article,1476-4687,dirk@fmi.ch,+,Novartis Research Foundation; European Union (NoE 'EpiGeneSys') [FP7-HEALTH-2010-257082]; European Union ('Blueprint' consortium) [FP7-282510]; European Research Council (EpiGePlas); Swiss initiative in Systems Biology (RTD Cell Plasticity); EMBO postdoctoral long-term fellowships; Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds,"We are grateful to S.

112,64,267.0,"The architecture of human chromosomes in interphase nuclei is still largely unknown. Microscopy studies have indicated that specific regions of chromosomes are located in close proximity to the nuclear lamina (NL)(1-3). This has led to the idea that certain genomic elements may be attached to the NL, which may contribute to the spatial organization of chromosomes inside the nucleus. However, sequences in the human genome that interact with the NL in vivo have not been identified. Here we construct a high-resolution map of the interaction sites of the entire genome with NL components in human fibroblasts. This map shows that genome - lamina interactions occur through more than 1,300 sharply defined large domains 0.1 - 10 megabases in size. These lamina-associated domains ( LADs) are typified by low gene- expression levels, indicating that LADs represent a repressive chromatin environment. The borders of LADs are demarcated by the insulator protein CTCF, by promoters that are oriented away from LADs, or by CpG islands, suggesting possible mechanisms of LAD confinement. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the human genome is divided into large, discrete domains that are units of chromosome organization within the nucleus.","Guelen, Lars; Pagie, Ludo; Brasset, Emilie; Meuleman, Wouter; Faza, Marius B.; Talhout, Wendy; Eussen, Bert H.; de Klein, Annelies; Wessels, Lodewyk; de Laat, Wouter; van Steensel, Bas","Guelen, L; Pagie, L; Brasset, E; Meuleman, W; Faza, MB; Talhout, W; Eussen, BH; de Klein, A; Wessels, L; de Laat, W; van Steensel, B",948.0,"[Guelen, Lars; Pagie, Ludo; Meuleman, Wouter; Faza, Marius B.; Talhout, Wendy; Wessels, Lodewyk; van Steensel, Bas] Netherlands Canc Inst, Div Mol Biol, NL-1066 CX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Brasset, Emilie; de Laat, Wouter] Erasmus MC, Dept Cell Biol & Genet, NL-3000 CA Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Eussen, Bert H.; de Klein, Annelies] Erasmus MC, Dept Clin Genet, NL-3000 CA Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Meuleman, Wouter; Wessels, Lodewyk] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Elect Engn Math & Comp Sci, NL-2628 CD Delft, Netherlands",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06947,Article,1476-4687,b.v.steensel@nki.nl,U83,,,311WV,Y,N,GENE-EXPRESSION; MEMBRANE PROTEIN; HUMAN GENOME; CELLS; ARCHITECTURE; LOCALIZATION; EMERIN; TRANSCRIPTION; MECHANISMS; PERIPHERY,7197.0,NATURE,Nature,English,35.0,No,"Meuleman, Wouter/0000-0002-1196-5401","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",12-Jun,5.0,LONDON,18463634.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,"Brasset, Emilie/J-6684-2015","van Steensel, B (reprint author), Netherlands Canc Inst, Div Mol Biol, Plesmanlaan 121, NL-1066 CX Amsterdam, Netherlands.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,780.0,Domain organization of human chromosomes revealed by mapping of nuclear lamina interactions,3.0,55.0,WOS:000256632000050,267.0,453,Multidisciplinary Sciences,793,bas,van steensel,17716.0,48,male,1.0,cYuEZiwAAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",34983676,1,na,0,Base J,na,0,0
113,120,14.0,"Modern strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from the Americas are closely related to those from Europe, supporting the assumption that human tuberculosis was introduced post-contact(1). This notion, however, is incompatible with archaeological evidence of pre-contact tuberculosis in the New World(2). Comparative genomics of modern isolates suggests that M. tuberculosis attained its worldwide distribution following human dispersals out of Africa during the Pleistocene epoch(3), although this has yet to be confirmed with ancient calibration points. Here we present three 1,000-year-old mycobacterial genomes from Peruvian human skeletons, revealing that a member of the M. tuberculosis complex caused human disease before contact. The ancient strains are distinct from known human-adapted forms and are most closely related to those adapted to seals and sea lions. Two independent dating approaches suggest a most recent common ancestor for the M. tuberculosis complex less than 6,000 years ago, which supports a Holocene dispersal of the disease. Our results implicate sea mammals as having played a role in transmitting the disease to humans across the ocean.","Bos, Kirsten I.; Harkins, Kelly M.; Herbig, Alexander; Coscolla, Mireia; Weber, Nico; Comas, Inaki; Forrest, Stephen A.; Bryant, Josephine M.; Harris, Simon R.; Schuenemann, Verena J.; Campbell, Tessa J.; Majander, Kerttu; Wilbur, Alicia K.; Guichon, Ricardo A.; Steadman, Dawnie L.

114,16,368.0,"Electrons in a single sheet of graphene behave quite differently from those in traditional two-dimensional electron systems. Like massless relativistic particles, they have linear dispersion and chiral eigenstates. Furthermore, two sets of electrons centred at different points in reciprocal space ('valleys') have this dispersion, giving rise to valley degeneracy. The symmetry between valleys, together with spin symmetry, leads to a fourfold quartet degeneracy of the Landau levels, observed as peaks in the density of states produced by an applied magnetic field. Recent electron transport measurements have observed the lifting of the fourfold degeneracy in very large applied magnetic fields, separating the quartet into integer(1-4) and, more recently, fractional(5,6) levels. The exact nature of the broken-symmetry states that form within the Landau levels and lift these degeneracies is unclear at present and is a topic of intense theoretical debate(7-11). Here we study the detailed features of the four quantum states that make up a degenerate graphene Landau level. We use high-resolution scanning tunnelling spectroscopy at temperatures as low as 10 mK in an applied magnetic field to study the top layer of multilayer epitaxial graphene. When the Fermi level lies inside the fourfold Landau manifold, significant electron correlation effects result in an enhanced valley splitting for even filling factors, and an enhanced electron spin splitting for odd filling factors. Most unexpectedly, we observe states with Landau level filling factors of 7/2, 9/2 and 11/2, suggestive of new many-body states in graphene.","Song, Young Jae; Otte, Alexander F.; Kuk, Young; Hu, Yike; Torrance, David B.; First, Phillip N.; de Heer, Walt A.; Min, Hongki; Adam, Shaffique; Stiles, Mark D.; MacDonald, Allan H.; Stroscio, Joseph A.","Song, YJ; Otte, AF; Kuk, Y; Hu, YK; Torrance, DB; First, PN; de Heer, WA; Min, HK; Adam, S; Stiles, MD; MacDonald, AH; Stroscio, JA",185.0,"[Song, Young Jae; Otte, Alexander F.; Min, Hongki; Adam, Shaffique; Stiles, Mark D.; Stroscio, Joseph A.] NIST, Ctr Nanoscale Sci & Technol, Gaithersburg, MD 20899 USA; [Song, Young Jae; Otte, Alexander F.; Min, Hongki] Univ Maryland, Maryland NanoCtr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Kuk, Young] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Seoul 1517474, South Korea; [Hu, Yike; Torrance, David B.; First, Phillip N.; de Heer, Walt A.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Phys, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [MacDonald, Allan H.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Phys, Austin, TX 78712 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09330,Article,,joseph.stroscio@nist.gov,189,"Korean Government (MOEHRD) [KRF- 2006-214-C00022]; NSF [DMR-0820382 [MRSEC], DMR-0804908, DMR-0606489]; Welch Foundation; Semiconductor Research Corporation","We thank N.

Recent X-ray analysis of the S. cerevisiae head module at 4.3 angstrom resolution led to a partial architectural model with three submodules called neck, fixed jaw and moveable jaw(10). Here we determine de novo the crystal structure of the head module from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe at 3.4 angstrom resolution. Structure solution was enabled by new structures of Med6 and the fixed jaw, and previous structures of the moveable jaw(11) and part of the neck(12), and required deletion of Med20. The S. pombe head module resembles the head of a crocodile with eight distinct elements, of which at least four are mobile. The fixed jaw comprises tooth and nose domains, whereas the neck submodule contains a helical spine and one limb, with shoulder, arm and finger elements. The arm and the essential shoulder contact other parts of Mediator. The jaws and a central joint are implicated in interactions with Pol II and its carboxy-terminal domain, and the joint is required for transcription in vitro. The S. pombe head module structure leads to a revised model of the S. cerevisiae module, reveals a high conservation and flexibility, explains knownmutations, and provides the basis for unravelling a central mechanism of gene regulation.","Lariviere, Laurent; Plaschka, Clemens; Seizl, Martin; Wenzeck, Larissa; Kurth, Fabian; Cramer, Patrick","Lariviere, L; Plaschka, C; Seizl, M; Wenzeck, L; Kurth, F; Cramer, P",448.0,"[Lariviere, Laurent; Plaschka, Clemens; Seizl, Martin; Wenzeck, Larissa; Kurth, Fabian; Cramer, Patrick] Univ Munich, Gene Ctr, D-81377 Munich, Germany; [Lariviere, Laurent; Plaschka, Clemens; Seizl, Martin; Wenzeck, Larissa; Kurth, Fabian; Cramer, Patrick] Univ Munich, CIPSM, Dept Biochem, D-81377 Munich, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11670,Article,,larivier@genzentrum.lmu.de; cramer@genzentrum.lmu.de,+,"Boehringer Ingelheim fellowship; Elite Network of Bavaria; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB646, TR5, GraKo1721, SFB960]; CIPSM; NIM; European Research Council; LMU innovativ project Bioimaging Network; Vallee Foundation; Jung-Stiftung","We thank S.

116,165,39.0,"Most great ape genetic variation remains uncharacterized(1,2); however, its study is critical for understanding population history(3-6), recombination(7), selection(8) and susceptibility to disease(9,10). Here we sequence to high coverage a total of 79 wild-and captive-born individuals representing all six great ape species and seven subspecies and report 88.8 million single nucleotide polymorphisms. Our analysis provides support for genetically distinct populations within each species, signals of gene flow, and the split of common chimpanzees into two distinct groups: Nigeria-Cameroon/western and central/eastern populations. We find extensive inbreeding in almost all wild populations, with eastern gorillas being the most extreme. Inferred effective population sizes have varied radically over time in different lineages and this appears to have a profound effect on the genetic diversity at, or close to, genes in almost all species. We discover and assign 1,982 loss-of-function variants throughout the human and great ape lineages, determining that the rate of gene loss has not been different in the human branch compared to other internal branches in the great ape phylogeny. This comprehensive catalogue of great ape genome diversity provides a framework for understanding evolution and a resource for more effective management of wild and captive great ape populations.","Prado-Martinez, Javier;

117,38,488.0,"Since its initial discovery nearly a decade ago(1), non-volcanic tremor has provided information about a region of the Earth that was previously thought incapable of generating seismic radiation. A thorough explanation of the geologic process responsible for tremor generation has, however, yet to be determined. Owing to their location at the plate interface, temporal correlation with geodetically measured slow-slip events and dominant shear wave energy, tremor observations in southwest Japan have been interpreted as a superposition of many low-frequency earthquakes that represent slip on a fault surface(2,3). Fluids may also be fundamental to the failure process in subduction zone environments, as teleseismic and tidal modulation of tremor in Cascadia and Japan and high Poisson ratios in both source regions are indicative of pressurized pore fluids(3-7). Here we identify a robust correlation between extremely small, tidally induced shear stress parallel to the San Andreas fault and non-volcanic tremor activity near Parkfield, California. We suggest that this tremor represents shear failure on a critically stressed fault in the presence of near-lithostatic pore pressure. There are a number of similarities between tremor in subduction zone environments, such as Cascadia and Japan, and tremor on the deep San Andreas transform(3-12), suggesting that the results presented here may also be applicable in other tectonic settings.","Thomas, Amanda M.; Nadeau, Robert M.; Buergmann, Roland","Thomas, AM; Nadeau, RM; Burgmann, R",1048.0,"[Thomas, Amanda M.; Nadeau, Robert M.; Buergmann, Roland] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Berkeley Seismol Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08654,Article,,amthomas@berkeley.edu,U105,"National Science Foundation [EAR-0537641, EAR-0544730]; US Geological Survey [06HQGR0167, 07HQAG0014, 08HQGR0100]","We thank D.

118,170,192.0,"To tackle incongruence, the topological conflict between different gene trees, phylogenomic studies couple concatenation with practices such as rogue taxon removal or the use of slowly evolving genes. Phylogenomic analysis of 1,070 orthologues from 23 yeast genomes identified 1,070 distinct gene trees, which were all incongruent with the phylogeny inferred from concatenation. Incongruence severity increased for shorter internodes located deeper in the phylogeny. Notably, whereas most practices had little or negative impact on the yeast phylogeny, the use of genes or internodes with high average internode support significantly improved the robustness of inference. We obtained similar results in analyses of vertebrate and metazoan phylogenomic data sets. These results question the exclusive reliance on concatenation and associated practices, and argue that selecting genes with strong phylogenetic signals and demonstrating the absence of significant incongruence are essential for accurately reconstructing ancient divergences.","Salichos, Leonidas; Rokas, Antonis","Salichos, L; Rokas, A",327.0,"[Salichos, Leonidas; Rokas, Antonis] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Nashville, TN 37235 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12130,Article,,antonis.rokas@vanderbilt.edu,+,National Science Foundation [DEB-0844968],We thank K.

119,9,147.0,"The relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) has become a cornerstone of community and ecosystem ecology(1-3) and an essential criterion for making decisions in conservation biology and policy planning(4,5). It has recently been proposed that evolutionary history should influence the BEF relationship because it determines species traits and, thus, species' ability to exploit resources(6,7). Here we test this hypothesis by combining experimental evolution with a BEF experiment. We isolated 20 bacterial strains from a marine environment and evolved each to be generalists or specialists(8). We then tested the effect of evolutionary history on the strength of the BEF relationship with assemblages of 1 to 20 species constructed from the specialists, generalists and ancestors(9). Assemblages of generalists were more productive on average because of their superior ability to exploit the environmental heterogeneity(10). The slope of the BEF relationship was, however, stronger for the specialist assemblages because of enhanced niche complementarity. These results show how the BEF relationship depends critically on the legacy of past evolutionary events.","Gravel, Dominique; Bell, Thomas; Barbera, Claire; Bouvier, Thierry; Pommier, Thomas; Venail, Patrick; Mouquet, Nicolas","Gravel, D; Bell, T; Barbera, C; Bouvier, T; Pommier, T; Venail, P; Mouquet, N",89.0,"[Gravel, Dominique] Univ Quebec, Dept Biol Chim & Geog, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada; [Gravel, Dominique; Barbera, Claire; Venail, Patrick; Mouquet, Nicolas] Univ Montpellier 2, CNRS, Inst Sci Evolut UMR 5554, F-34095 Montpellier 05, France; [Bell, Thomas] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Bouvier, Thierry; Pommier, Thomas] Univ Montpellier 2, CNRS, Ecosyst Langunaires UMR 5119, F-34095 Montpellier 05, France; [Pommier, Thomas] Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, INRA, UMR 5557,USC 1193,Lab Ecol Microbienne, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09592,Article,,dominique_gravel@uqar.qc.ca; nmouquet@univ-montp2.fr,U1601,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Canada Research Chair Program;  [ANR-09-JCJC-0110-01],"We thank T.

120,217,209.0,"The basolateral amygdala (BLA) has a crucial role in emotional learning irrespective of valence(1-5,21-23). The BLA projection to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is thought to modulate cue-triggered motivated behaviours(4,6,7,24,25), but our understanding of the interaction between these two brain regions has been limited by the inability to manipulate neural-circuit elements of this pathway selectively during behaviour. To circumvent this limitation, we used in vivo optogenetic stimulation or inhibition of glutamatergic fibres from the BLA to the NAc, coupled with intracranial pharmacology and ex vivo electrophysiology. Here we show that optical stimulation of the pathway from the BLA to the NAc in mice reinforces behavioural responding to earn additional optical stimulation of these synaptic inputs. Optical stimulation of these glutamatergic fibres required intra-NAc dopamine D1-type receptor signalling, but not D2-type receptor signalling. Brief optical inhibition of fibres from the BLA to the NAc reduced cue-evoked intake of sucrose, demonstrating an important role of this specific pathway in controlling naturally occurring reward-related behaviour. Moreover, although optical stimulation of glutamatergic fibres from the medial prefrontal cortex to the NAc also elicited reliable excitatory synaptic responses, optical self-stimulation behaviour was not observed by activation of this pathway. These data indicate that whereas the BLA is important for processing both positive and negative affect, the glutamatergic pathway from the BLA to the NAc, in conjunction with dopamine signalling in the NAc, promotes motivated behavioural responding. Thus, optogenetic manipulation of anatomically distinct synaptic inputs to the NAc reveals functionally distinct properties of these inputs in controlling reward-seeking behaviours.","Stuber, Garret D.; Sparta, Dennis R.; Stamatakis, Alice M.; van Leeuwen, Wieke A.; Hardjoprajitno, Juanita E.; Cho, Saemi; Tye, Kay M.; Kempadoo, Kimberly A.; Zhang, Feng; Deisseroth, Karl; Bonci, Antonello","Stuber, GD; Sparta, DR; Stamatakis, AM; van Leeuwen, WA; Hardjoprajitno, JE; Cho, S; Tye, KM; Kempadoo, KA; Zhang, F; Deisseroth, K; Bonci, A",377.0,"[Stuber, Garret D.; Sparta, Dennis R.; Stamatakis, Alice M.] Univ N Carolina, UNC Neurosci Ctr, Dept Psychiat, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Stuber, Garret D.; Sparta, Dennis R.; Stamatakis, Alice M.] Univ N Carolina, UNC Neurosci Ctr, Dept Cell & Mol Physiol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Stuber, Garret D.; Sparta, Dennis R.; van Leeuwen, Wieke A.; Hardjoprajitno, Juanita E.; Cho, Saemi; Tye, Kay M.; Kempadoo, Kimberly A.; Bonci, Antonello] Univ Calif San Francisco, Wheeler Ctr Neurobiol Drug Addict, Dept Neurol, Ernest Gallo Clin & Res Ctr, San Francisco, CA 94608 USA; [Tye, Kay M.; Zhang, Feng; Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Tye, Kay M.; Zhang, Feng; Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Dept Bioengn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Bonci, Antonello] NIDA, Intramural Res Program, Baltimore, MD 21224 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10194,Article,,gstuber@med.unc.edu,U129,NARSAD; ABMRF; Foundation of Hope; NIDA [DA029325]; Psychiatry Department at UNC Chapel Hill; State of California through the University of California at San Francisco;  [F32AA018610],"We thank J.

121,127,190.0,"Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoinflammatory disease that affects 1-2% of the world's population and is characterized by widespread joint inflammation. Interleukin-1 is an important mediator of cartilage destruction in rheumatic diseases(1), but our understanding of the upstream mechanisms leading to production of interleukin-1 beta in rheumatoid arthritis is limited by the absence of suitable mouse models of the disease in which inflammasomes contribute to pathology. Myeloid-cell-specific deletion of the rheumatoid arthritis susceptibility gene A20/Tnfaip3 in mice (A20(myel-KO) mice) triggers a spontaneous erosive polyarthritis that resembles rheumatoid arthritis in patients(2). Rheumatoid arthritis in A20(myel-KO) mice is not rescued by deletion of tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 (ref. 2). Here we show, however, that it crucially relies on the Nlrp3 inflammasome and interleukin-1 receptor signalling. Macrophages lacking A 20 have increased basal and lipopolysaccharide-induced expression levels of the inflammasome adaptor Nlrp3 and proIL-beta b. As a result, A 20-deficiency in macrophages significantly enhances Nlrp3 inflammasome- mediated caspase-1 activation, pyroptosis and interleukin-1 beta secretion by soluble and crystalline Nlrp3 stimuli. In contrast, activation of the Nlrc4 and AIM2 inflammasomes is not altered. Importantly, increased Nlrp3 inflammasome activation contributes to the pathology of rheumatoid arthritis in vivo, because deletion of Nlrp3, caspase-1 and the interleukin-1 receptor markedly protects against rheumatoid-arthritis-associated inflammation and cartilage destruction in A20(myel-KO) mice. These results reveal A20 as a novel negative regulator of Nlrp3 inflammasome activation, and describe A(20myel-KO) mice as the first experimental model to study the role of inflammasomes in the pathology of rheumatoid arthritis.","Vande Walle, Lieselotte; Van Opdenbosch, Nina; Jacques, Peggy; Fossoul, Amelie; Verheugen, Eveline; Vogel, Peter; Beyaert, Rudi; Elewaut, Dirk; Kanneganti, Thirumala-Devi; van Loo, Geert; Lamkanfi, Mohamed","Vande Walle, L; Van Opdenbosch, N; Jacques, P; Fossoul, A; Verheugen, E; Vogel, P; Beyaert, R; Elewaut, D; Kanneganti, TD; van Loo, G; Lamkanfi, M",69.0,"[Vande Walle, Lieselotte; Van Opdenbosch, Nina; Fossoul, Amelie; Lamkanfi, Mohamed] Univ Ghent VIB, Dept Med Prot Res, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Vande Walle, Lieselotte; Van Opdenbosch, Nina; Fossoul, Amelie; Lamkanfi, Mohamed] Univ Ghent, Dept Biochem, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Jacques, Peggy; Verheugen, Eveline; Elewaut, Dirk] Univ Ghent, Dept Rheumatol, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Vogel, Peter; Kanneganti, Thirumala-Devi] St Jude Childrens Res Hosp, Dept Immunol, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Beyaert, Rudi; van Loo, Geert] Univ Ghent VIB, Inflammat Res Ctr, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium; [Beyaert, Rudi; van Loo, Geert] Univ Ghent, Dept Biomed Mol Biol, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13322,Article,1476-4687,mohamed.lamkanfi@vib-ugent.be,+,"Ghent University [BOF14/GOA/013]; European Research Council [281600]; FWO [G030212N, 1.2.201.10.N.00, 1.5.122.11.N.00, Odysseus-G091908, G061910N, G016812N]; Queen Elisabeth Medical Foundation; Ghent University Group-ID MRP; National Institutes of Health [AR056296, CA163507, AI101935]; American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities","We thank R.

122,342,102.0,"Nuclear-architecture defects have been shown to correlate with the manifestation of a number of human diseases as well as ageing(1-4). It is therefore plausible that diseases whose manifestations correlate with ageing might be connected to the appearance of nuclear aberrations over time. We decided to evaluate nuclear organization in the context of ageing-associated disorders by focusing on a leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) dominant mutation (G2019S; glycine-to-serine substitution at amino acid 2019), which is associated with familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease as well as impairment of adult neurogenesis in mice(5). Here we report on the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from Parkinson's disease patients and the implications of LRRK2 (G2019S) mutation in human neural-stem-cell (NSC) populations. Mutant NSCs showed increased susceptibility to proteasomal stress as well as passage-dependent deficiencies in nuclear-envelope organization, clonal expansion and neuronal differentiation. Disease phenotypes were rescued by targeted correction of the LRRK2 (G2019S) mutation with its wild-type counterpart in Parkinson's disease iPSCs and were recapitulated after targeted knock-in of the LRRK2(G2019S) mutation in human embryonic stem cells. Analysis of human brain tissue showed nuclear-envelope impairment in clinically diagnosed Parkinson's disease patients. Together, our results identify the nucleus as a previously unknown cellular organelle in Parkinson's disease pathology and may help to open new avenues for Parkinson's disease diagnoses as well as for the potential development of therapeutics targeting this fundamental cell structure.","Liu, Guang-Hui; Qu, Jing; Suzuki, Keiichiro; Nivet, Emmanuel; Li, Mo; Montserrat, Nuria; Yi, Fei; Xu, Xiuling; Ruiz, Sergio; Zhang, Weiqi; Wagner, Ulrich; Kim, Audrey; Ren, Bing; Li, Ying; Goebl, April; Kim, Jessica; Soligalla, Rupa Devi; Dubova, Ilir; Thompson, James; Yates, John, III; Esteban, Concepcion Rodriguez; Sancho-Martinez, Ignacio; Izpisua Belmonte, Juan Carlos","Liu, GH; Qu, J; Suzuki, K; Nivet, E; Li, M; Montserrat, N; Yi, F; Xu, XL; Ruiz, S; Zhang, WQ; Wagner, U; Kim, A; Ren, B; Li, Y; Goebl, A; Kim, J; Soligalla, RD; Dubova, I; Thompson, J; Yates, J; Esteban, CR; Sancho-Martinez, I; Belmonte, JCI",603.0,"[Liu, Guang-Hui; Qu, Jing; Suzuki, Keiichiro; Nivet, Emmanuel; Li, Mo; Yi, Fei; Ruiz, Sergio; Goebl, April; Kim, Jessica; Soligalla, Rupa Devi; Dubova, Ilir; Esteban, Concepcion Rodriguez; Sancho-Martinez, Ignacio; Izpisua Belmonte, Juan Carlos] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Gene Express Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Liu, Guang-Hui; Qu, Jing; Xu, Xiuling; Zhang, Weiqi; Li, Ying] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Biophys, Natl Lab Biomacromol, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Montserrat, Nuria; Izpisua Belmonte, Juan Carlos] Ctr Regenerat Med Barcelona, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Wagner, Ulrich; Kim, Audrey; Ren, Bing] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Ludwig Inst Canc Res, Dept Cellular & Mol Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Thompson, James; Yates, John, III] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Cell Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11557,Article,,ghliu@ibp.ac.cn; belmonte@salk.edu,607,"Thousand Young Talents program of China; National Laboratory of Biomacromolecules; Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [81271266, 31222039]; Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation; AFAR/Ellison Medical Foundation; Uehara Memorial Foundation; F.M.

123,267,457.0,"Zoonotic infectious diseases such as influenza continue to pose a grave threat to human health(1). However, the factors that mediate the emergence of RNA viruses such as influenza A virus (IAV) are still incompletely understood(2,3). Phylogenetic inference is crucial to reconstructing the origins and tracing the flow of IAV within and between hosts(3-8). Here we show that explicitly allowing IAV host lineages to have independent rates of molecular evolution is necessary for reliable phylogenetic inference of IAV and that methods that do not do so, including 'relaxed' molecular clock models(9), can be positively misleading. A phylogenomic analysis using a host-specific local clock model recovers extremely consistent evolutionary histories across all genomic segments and demonstrates that the equine H7N7 lineage is a sister clade to strains from birds-as well as those from humans, swine and the equine H3N8 lineage-sharing an ancestor with them in the mid to late 1800s. Moreover, major western and eastern hemisphere avian influenza lineages inferred for each gene coalesce in the late 1800s. On the basis of these phylogenies and the synchrony of these key nodes, we infer that the internal genes of avian influenza virus (AIV) underwent a global selective sweep beginning in the late 1800s, a process that continued throughout the twentieth century and up to the present. The resulting western hemispheric AIV lineage subsequently contributed most of the genomic segments to the 1918 pandemic virus and, independently, the 1963 equine H3N8 panzootic lineage. This approach provides a clear resolution of evolutionary patterns and processes in IAV, including the flow of viral genes and genomes within and between host lineages.","Worobey, Michael; Han, Guan-Zhu; Rambaut, Andrew","Worobey, M; Han, GZ; Rambaut, A",254.0,"[Worobey, Michael; Han, Guan-Zhu] Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Rambaut, Andrew] Univ Edinburgh, Inst Evolutionary Biol, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland; [Rambaut, Andrew] NIH, Fogarty Int Ctr, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13016,Article,1476-4687,worobey@email.arizona.edu; a.rambaut@ed.ac.uk,+,David and Lucile Packard Foundation; Wellcome Trust [092807]; European Union [278433-PREDEMICS]; European Research Council [260864]; National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [R01AI084691],"We thank J.

Caenorhabditis elegans normally responds to mitochondrial dysfunction with activation of mitochondrial-repair, drug-detoxification and pathogen-response pathways(1-7). Here, from a genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screen, we identified 45 C. elegans genes that are required to upregulate detoxification, pathogen-response and mitochondrial-repair pathways after inhibition of mitochondrial function by drug-induced or genetic disruption. Animals defective in ceramide biosynthesis are deficient in mitochondrial surveillance, and addition of particular ceramides can rescue the surveillance defects. Ceramide can also rescue the mitochondrial surveillance defects of other gene inactivations, mapping these gene activities upstream of ceramide. Inhibition of the mevalonate pathway, either by RNAi or statin drugs, also disrupts mitochondrial surveillance. Growth of C. elegans with a significant fraction of bacterial species from their natural habitat causes mitochondrial dysfunction. Other bacterial species inhibit C. elegans defence responses to a mitochondrial toxin, revealing bacterial countermeasures to animal defence.","Liu, Ying; Samuel, Buck S.; Breen, Peter C.; Ruvkun, Gary","Liu, Y; Samuel, BS; Breen, PC; Ruvkun, G",406.0,"[Liu, Ying; Samuel, Buck S.; Breen, Peter C.; Ruvkun, Gary] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Mol Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Liu, Ying; Samuel, Buck S.; Breen, Peter C.; Ruvkun, Gary] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13204,Article,1476-4687,ruvkun@molbio.mgh.harvard.edu,+,Helen Hay Whitney research fellowship; Charles King Trust postdoctoral fellowship; National Institutes of Health [NIH AG043184-16],"We thank C.

126,385,141.0,"Numerous feathered dinosaur specimens have recently been recovered from the Middle-Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous deposits of northeastern China, but most of them represent small animals(1). Here we report the discovery of a gigantic new basal tyrannosauroid, Yutyrannus huali gen. et sp. nov., based on three nearly complete skeletons representing two distinct ontogenetic stages from the Lower Cretaceous Yixian Formation of Liaoning Province, China. Y. huali shares some features, particularly of the cranium, with derived tyrannosauroids(2,3), but is similar to other basal tyrannosauroids(4-12) in possessing a three-fingered manus and a typical theropod pes. Morphometric analysis suggests that Y. huali differed from tyrannosaurids in its growth strategy(13,14). Most significantly, Y. huali bears long filamentous feathers, thus providing direct evidence for the presence of extensively feathered gigantic dinosaurs and offering new insights into early feather evolution.","Xu, Xing; Wang, Kebai; Zhang, Ke; Ma, Qingyu; Xing, Lida; Sullivan, Corwin; Hu, Dongyu; Cheng, Shuqing; Wang, Shuo","Xu, X; Wang, KB; Zhang, K; Ma, QY; Xing, LD; Sullivan, C; Hu, DY; Cheng, SQ; Wang, S",92.0,"[Xu, Xing; Ma, Qingyu; Sullivan, Corwin; Wang, Shuo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Paleontol & Paleoanthropol, Key Lab Evolutionary Systemat Vertebrates, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [Xu, Xing; Hu, Dongyu] Shenyang Normal Univ, Liaoning Paleontol Museum, Shenyang 110034, Peoples R China; [Wang, Kebai; Cheng, Shuqing] Zhucheng Dinosaur Museum, Zhucheng 262200, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Ke] China Univ Geosci, Sch Earth Sci & Resources, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Xing, Lida] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada; [Wang, Shuo] Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Univ, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10906,Article,1476-4687,xingxu@vip.sina.com,95,Zhucheng Municipal Government; Erlianhaote Municipal Government; National Natural Science Foundation of China; Special Funds For Major State Basic Research Projects of China,"We thank L.

127,207,47.0,"In recent years, several associations between common chronic human disorders and altered gut microbiome composition and function have been reported(1,2). In most of these reports, treatment regimens were not controlled for and conclusions could thus be confounded by the effects of various drugs on the microbiota, which may obscure microbial causes, protective factors or diagnostically relevant signals. Our study addresses disease and drug signatures in the human gut microbiome of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Two previous quantitative gut metagenomics studies of T2D patients that were unstratified for treatment yielded divergent conclusions regarding its associated gut microbial dysbiosis(3,4). Here we show, using 784 available human gut metagenomes, how antidiabetic medication confounds these results, and analyse in detail the effects of the most widely used antidiabetic drug metformin. We provide support for microbial mediation of the therapeutic effects of metformin through short-chain fatty acid production, as well as for potential microbiota-mediated mechanisms behind known intestinal adverse effects in the form of a relative increase in abundance of Escherichia species. Controlling for metformin treatment, we report a unified signature of gut microbiome shifts in T2D with a depletion of butyrate-producing taxa(3,4). These in turn cause functional microbiome shifts, in part alleviated by metformin-induced changes. Overall, the present study emphasizes the need to disentangle gut microbiota signatures of specific human diseases from those of medication.","Forslund, Kristoffer; Hildebrand, Falk; Nielsen, Trine; Falony, Gwen; Le Chatelier, Emmanuelle; Sunagawa, Shinichi; Prifti, Edi; Vieira-Silva, Sara; Gudmundsdottir, Valborg; Pedersen, Helle Krogh; Arumugam, Manimozhiyan; Kristiansen, Karsten; Voigt, Anita Yvonne; Vestergaard, Henrik; Hercog, Rajna; Costea, Paul Igor; Kultima, Jens Roat; Li, Junhua; Jorgensen, Torben; Levenez, Florence; Dore, Joel; Nielsen, H.

128,322,417.0,"Logic devices based on magnetism show promise for increasing computational efficiency while decreasing consumed power. They offer zero quiescent power and yet combine novel functions such as programmable logic operation and non-volatile built-in memory(1-5). However, practical efforts to adapt a magnetic device to logic suffer from a low signal-to-noise ratio and other performance attributes that are not adequate for logic gates. Rather than exploiting magnetoresistive effects that result from spin-dependent transport of carriers, we have approached the development of a magnetic logic device in a different way: we use the phenomenon of large magnetoresistance found in non-magnetic semiconductors in high electric fields(6,7). Here we report a device showing a strong diode characteristic that is highly sensitive to both the sign and the magnitude of an external magnetic field, offering a reversible change between two different characteristic states by the application of a magnetic field. This feature results from magnetic control of carrier generation(8) and recombination in an InSb p-n bilayer channel(9). Simple circuits combining such elementary devices are fabricated and tested, and Boolean logic functions including AND, OR, NAND and NOR are performed. They are programmed dynamically by external electric or magnetic signals, demonstrating magnetic-field-controlled semiconductor reconfigurable logic at room temperature. This magnetic technology permits a new kind of spintronic device, characterized as a current switch rather than a voltage switch, and provides a simple and compact platform for non-volatile reconfigurable logic devices.","Joo, Sungjung; Kim, Taeyueb; Shin, Sang Hoon; Lim, Ju Young; Hong, Jinki; Song, Jin Dong; Chang, Joonyeon; Lee, Hyun-Woo; Rhie, Kungwon; Han, Suk Hee; Shin, Kyung-Ho; Johnson, Mark","Joo, S; Kim, T; Shin, SH; Lim, JY; Hong, J; Song, JD; Chang, J; Lee, HW; Rhie, K; Han, SH; Shin, KH; Johnson, M",72.0,"[Joo, Sungjung; Kim, Taeyueb; Chang, Joonyeon; Han, Suk Hee; Shin, Kyung-Ho] KIST, Spin Convergence Res Ctr, Seoul 130650, South Korea; [Joo, Sungjung; Kim, Taeyueb; Hong, Jinki; Rhie, Kungwon] Korea Univ, Dept Display & Semicond Phys, Sejong 339700, South Korea; [Shin, Sang Hoon; Lim, Ju Young; Song, Jin Dong] KIST, Nano Photon Res Ctr, Seoul 130650, South Korea; [Lee, Hyun-Woo] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Phys, Pohang 790784, South Korea; [Johnson, Mark] USN, Res Lab, Washington, DC 20375 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11817,Article,,jkhongjkhong@korea.ac.kr; jdsong@kist.re.kr,76,"KIST; NRF; MEST [2010-0000506, 2011-0012386, 2012-0005631, 2012K001280]; industrial strategic technology development programme; MKE [KI002182]; GRL; Office of Naval Research","This work was supported by the KIST vision 21 programme, NRF grants funded by MEST (2010-0000506,2011-0012386 and 2012-0005631), the industrial strategic technology development programme funded by MKE (KI002182), the Dream project, MEST (2012K001280), GRL and the Office of Naval Research.",087DJ,,,SILICON; MAGNETOCONCENTRATION,7435.0,NATURE,Nature,English,21.0,No,"Lee, Hyun-Woo/0000-0002-1648-8093","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",7-Feb,5.0,LONDON,23364687.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2013.0,"Lee, Hyun-Woo/B-8995-2008","Hong, J (reprint author), Korea Univ, Dept Display & Semicond Phys, Sejong 339700, South Korea.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,48.0,Magnetic-field-controlled reconfigurable semiconductor logic,9.0,155.0,WOS:000314741200036,417.0,494,Multidisciplinary Sciences,48,mark,johnson,89898.0,6176,male,1.0,di91z5wAAAAJ,5,"(17929, ]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
129,81,22.0,"Brachydactyly type A1 (BDA1) was the first recorded disorder of the autosomal dominant Mendelian trait in humans, characterized by shortened or absent middle phalanges in digits. It is associated with heterozygous missense mutations in indian hedgehog (IHH)(1,2). Hedgehog proteins are important morphogens for a wide range of developmental processes(3,4). The capacity and range of signalling is thought to be regulated by its interaction with the receptor PTCH1 and antagonist HIP1. Here we show that a BDA1 mutation (E95K) in Ihh impairs the interaction of IHH with PTCH1 and HIP1. This is consistent with a recent paper showing that BDA1 mutations cluster in a calcium-binding site essential for the interaction with its receptor and cell-surface partners(5). Furthermore, we show that in a mouse model that recapitulates the E95K mutation, there is a change in the potency and range of signalling. The mice have digit abnormalities consistent with the human disorder.","Gao, Bo; Hu, Jianxin; Stricker, Sigmar; Cheung, Martin; Ma, Gang; Law, Kit Fong; Witte, Florian; Briscoe, James; Mundlos, Stefan; He, Lin; Cheah, Kathryn S.

130,309,212.0,"The violation of a Bell inequality is an experimental observation that forces the abandonment of a local realistic viewpoint-namely, one in which physical properties are (probabilistically) defined before and independently of measurement, and in which no physical influence can propagate faster than the speed of light(1,2). All such experimental violations require additional assumptions depending on their specific construction, making them vulnerable to so-called loopholes. Here we use entangled photons to violate a Bell inequality while closing the fair-sampling loophole, that is, without assuming that the sample of measured photons accurately represents the entire ensemble(3). To do this, we use the Eberhard form of Bell's inequality, which is not vulnerable to the fair-sampling assumption and which allows a lower collection efficiency than other forms(4). Technical improvements of the photon source(5,6) and high-efficiency transition-edge sensors(7) were crucial for achieving a sufficiently high collection efficiency. Our experiment makes the photon the first physical system for which each of the main loopholes has been closed, albeit in different experiments.","Giustina, Marissa; Mech, Alexandra; Ramelow, Sven; Wittmann, Bernhard; Kofler, Johannes; Beyer, Joern; Lita, Adriana; Calkins, Brice; Gerrits, Thomas; Nam, SaeWoo; Ursin, Rupert; Zeilinger, Anton","Giustina, M; Mech, A; Ramelow, S; Wittmann, B; Kofler, J; Beyer, J; Lita, A; Calkins, B; Gerrits, T; Nam, S; Ursin, R; Zeilinger, A",227.0,"[Giustina, Marissa; Mech, Alexandra; Ramelow, Sven; Wittmann, Bernhard; Kofler, Johannes; Ursin, Rupert; Zeilinger, Anton] Austrian Acad Sci, IQOQI, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Giustina, Marissa; Mech, Alexandra; Ramelow, Sven; Wittmann, Bernhard; Zeilinger, Anton] Univ Vienna, Fac Phys, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Kofler, Johannes] Max Planck Inst Quantum Opt MPQ, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Beyer, Joern] Phys Tech Bundesanstalt, D-10587 Berlin, Germany; [Lita, Adriana; Calkins, Brice; Gerrits, Thomas; Nam, SaeWoo] NIST, Boulder, CO 80305 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12012,Article,,marissa.giustina@univie.ac.at; anton.zeilinger@univie.ac.at,230,"ERC [QIT4QAD 227844]; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [SFB F4008, CoQuS]; Q-ESSENCE [248095]; QAP [15848]; Marie Curie Research Training Network EMALI [MRTN-CT-2006-035369]; John Templeton Foundation; NIST Quantum Information Science Initiative (QISI), an agency of the US Government","We acknowledge M.

131,114,499.0,"In yeast, the transcription factor Crz1 is dephosphorylated and translocates into the nucleus in response to extracellular calcium. Here we show, using time- lapse microscopy, that Crz1 exhibits short bursts of nuclear localization ( typically lasting 2 min) that occur stochastically in individual cells and propagate to the expression of downstream genes. Strikingly, calcium concentration controls the frequency, but not the duration, of localization bursts. Using an analytic model, we also show that this frequency modulation of bursts ensures proportional expression of multiple target genes across a wide dynamic range of expression levels, independent of promoter characteristics. We experimentally confirm this theory with natural and synthetic Crz1 target promoters. Another stress- response transcription factor, Msn2, exhibits similar, but largely uncorrelated, localization bursts under calcium stress suggesting that frequency- modulation regulation of localization bursts may be a general control strategy used by the cell to coordinate multi- gene responses to external signals.","Cai, Long; Dalal, Chiraj K.; Elowitz, Michael B.","Cai, L; Dalal, CK; Elowitz, MB",485.0,"[Cai, Long; Dalal, Chiraj K.; Elowitz, Michael B.] CALTECH, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Div Biol, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Cai, Long; Dalal, Chiraj K.; Elowitz, Michael B.] CALTECH, Dept Appl Phys, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07292,Article,,melowitz@caltech.edu,U16,"Beckman Fellows Program at Caltech; National Institutes of Health [R01GM079771]; National Centers of Systems Biology, and the Packard Foundation [P50 GM068763]","We thank M.

133,178,311.0,"The ability of mass spectrometry to generate intact biomolecular ions efficiently in the gas phase has led to its widespread application in metabolomics(1), proteomics(2), biological imaging(3), biomarker discovery(4) and clinical assays (namely neonatal screens(5)). Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization(6,7) (MALDI) and electrospray ionization(8) have been at the forefront of these developments. However, matrix application complicates the use of MALDI for cellular, tissue, biofluid and microarray analysis and can limit the spatial resolution because of the matrix crystal size(9) (typically more than 10 mu m), sensitivity and detection of small compounds (less than 500 Da). Secondary-ion mass spectrometry(10) has extremely high lateral resolution (100 nm) and has found biological applications(11,12) although the energetic desorption/ionization is a limitation owing to molecular fragmentation. Here we introduce nanostructure- initiator mass spectrometry (NIMS), a tool for spatially defined mass analysis. NIMS uses 'initiator' molecules trapped in nanostructured surfaces or 'clathrates' to release and ionize intact molecules adsorbed on the surface. This surface responds to both ion and laser irradiation. The lateral resolution (ion-NIMS about 150 nm), sensitivity, matrix-free and reduced fragmentation of NIMS allows direct characterization of peptide microarrays, direct mass analysis of single cells, tissue imaging, and direct characterization of blood and urine.","Northen, Trent R.; Yanes, Oscar; Northen, Michael T.; Marrinucci, Dena; Uritboonthai, Winnie; Apon, Junefredo; Golledge, Stephen L.; Nordstrom, Anders; Siuzdak, Gary","Northen, TR; Yanes, O; Northen, MT; Marrinucci, D; Uritboonthai, W; Apon, J; Golledge, SL; Nordstrom, A; Siuzdak, G",1033.0,"Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; Scripps Res Inst, Scripps Ctr Mass Spectrometry, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; Scripps Res Inst, Dept Cell Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Mat, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; Univ Oregon, CAMCOR Surface Anal Facil, Eugene, OR 97403 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06195,Article,,siuzdak@scripps.edu,U3,,,223TK,Y,N,SECONDARY-ION MS; DESORPTION-IONIZATION; ELECTROSPRAY-IONIZATION; LARGE BIOMOLECULES; TISSUE-SECTIONS; SEPARATION; PROTEINS; DRUGS; BLOOD; SIMS,7165.0,NATURE,Nature,English,28.0,No,"Yanes, Oscar/0000-0003-3695-7157; Northen, Trent/0000-0001-8404-3259; Siuzdak, Gary/0000-0002-4749-0014","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",25-Oct,5.0,LONDON,17960240.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007.0,"Northen, Trent/K-3139-2012; Yanes, Oscar/N-3630-2016","Siuzdak, G (reprint author), Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol Biol, 10666 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,288.0,Clathrate nanostructures for mass spectrometry,24.0,191.0,WOS:000250395000048,311.0,449,Multidisciplinary Sciences,290,gary,siuzdak,24433.0,2132,male,1.0,3BpMXA8AAAAJ,5,"(17929, ]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
134,271,22.0,"RNA interference is widely distributed in eukaryotes and has a variety of functions, including antiviral defence and gene regulation(1,2). All RNA interference pathways use small single-stranded RNA(ssRNA) molecules that guide proteins of the Argonaute (Ago) family to complementary ssRNA targets: RNA-guided RNA interference(1,2). The role of prokaryotic Ago variants has remained elusive, although bioinformatics analysis has suggested their involvement in host defence(3). Here we demonstrate that Ago of the bacterium Thermus thermophilus (TtAgo) acts as a barrier for the uptake and propagation of foreign DNA. In vivo, TtAgo is loaded with 5'-phosphorylated DNA guides, 13-25 nucleotides in length, that are mostly plasmid derived and have a strong bias for a 5'-end deoxycytidine. These small interfering DNAs guide TtAgo to cleave complementary DNA strands. Hence, despite structural homology to its eukaryotic counterparts, TtAgo functions in host defence by DNA-guided DNA interference.","Swarts, Daan C.; Jore, Matthijs M.; Westra, Edze R.; Zhu, Yifan; Janssen, Jorijn H.; Snijders, Ambrosius P.; Wang, Yanli; Patel, Dinshaw J.; Berenguer, Jose; Brouns, Stan J.

135,244,176.0,"The Greenlandic population, a small and historically isolated founder population comprising about 57,000 inhabitants, has experienced a dramatic increase in type 2 diabetes (T2D) prevalence during the past 25 years(1). Motivated by this, we performed association mapping of T2D-related quantitative traits in up to 2,575 Greenlandic individuals without known diabetes. Using array-based genotyping and exome sequencing, we discovered a nonsense p.Arg684Ter variant (in which arginine is replaced by a termination codon) in the gene TBC1D4 with an allele frequency of 17%. Here we show that homozygous carriers of this variant have markedly higher concentrations of plasma glucose(beta=3.8 mmol l(-1), P = 2.5 X 10(-35)) and serum insulin (beta = 165 pmol l(-1), P = 1.5 X 10(-20)) 2 hours after an oral glucose load compared with individuals with other genotypes (both non-carriers and heterozygous carriers). Furthermore, homozygous carriers have marginally lower concentrations of fasting plasma glucose (beta = -0.18 mmol l(-1), P = 1.1 X 10(-6)) and fasting serum insulin (beta = -8.3 pmol l(-1), P = 0.0014), and their T2D risk is markedly increased (odds ratio (OR) = 10.3, P = 1.6 X 10(-24)). Heterozygous carriers have a moderately higher plasma glucose concentration 2 hours after an oral glucose load than non-carriers (beta = 0.43 mmol l(-1), P = 5.3 X 10(-5)). Analyses of skeletal muscle biopsies showed lower messenger RNA and protein levels of the long isoform of TBC1D4, and lower muscle protein levels of the glucose transporter GLUT4, with increasing number of p.Arg684Ter alleles. These findings are concomitant with a severely decreased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in muscle, leading to postprandial hyperglycaemia, impaired glucose tolerance and T2D. The observed effect sizes are several times larger than any previous findings in large-scale genome-wide association studies of these traits(2-4) and constitute further proof of the value of conducting genetic association studies outside the traditional setting of large homogeneous populations.","Moltke, Ida; Grarup, Niels; Jorgensen, Marit E.; Bjerregaard, Peter; Treebak, Jonas T.; Fumagalli, Matteo; Korneliussen, Thorfinn S.; Andersen, Marianne A.; Nielsen, Thomas S.; Krarup, Nikolaj T.; Gjesing, Anette P.; Zierath, Juleen R.; Linneberg, Allan; Wu, Xueli; Sun, Guangqing; Jin, Xin; Al-Aama, Jumana; Wang, Jun; Borch-Johnsen, Knut; Pedersen, Oluf; Nielsen, Rasmus; Albrechtsen, Anders; Hansen, Torben","Moltke, I; Grarup, N; Jorgensen, ME; Bjerregaard, P; Treebak, JT; Fumagalli, M; Korneliussen, TS; Andersen, MA; Nielsen, TS; Krarup, NT; Gjesing, AP; Zierath, JR; Linneberg, A; Wu, XL; Sun, GQ; Jin, X; Al-Aama, J; Wang, J; Borch-Johnsen, K; Pedersen, O; Nielsen, R; Albrechtsen, A; Hansen, T",190.0,"[Moltke, Ida; Albrechtsen, Anders] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, Bioinformat Ctr, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Moltke, Ida] Univ Chicago, Dept Human Genet, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Grarup, Niels; Krarup, Nikolaj T.; Gjesing, Anette P.; Wang, Jun; Pedersen, Oluf; Hansen, Torben] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Hlth & Med Sci, Novo Nordisk Fdn Ctr Basic Metab Res, Sect Metab Genet, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Jorgensen, Marit E.] Steno Diabet Ctr, DK-2820 Gentofte, Denmark; [Bjerregaard, Peter] Univ Southern Denmark, Natl Inst Publ Hlth, DK-1353 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Treebak, Jonas T.; Andersen, Marianne A.; Nielsen, Thomas S.; Zierath, Juleen R.] Univ Copenhagen, Novo Nordisk Fdn Ctr Basic Metab Res, Fac Hlth & Med Sci, Sect Integrat Physiol, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Fumagalli, Matteo; Nielsen, Rasmus] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Korneliussen, Thorfinn S.] Univ Copenhagen, Nat Hist Museum Denmark, Ctr GeoGenet, DK-1350 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Zierath, Juleen R.] Karolinska Inst, Dept Mol Med & Surg, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Linneberg, Allan] Glostrup Univ Hosp, Res Ctr Prevent & Hlth, DK-2600 Glostrup, Denmark; [Wu, Xueli; Sun, Guangqing; Jin, Xin; Al-Aama, Jumana; Wang, Jun] BGI Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, Peoples R China; [Al-Aama, Jumana; Wang, Jun] King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Med, Dept Med Genet, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia; [Al-Aama, Jumana; Wang, Jun] King Abdulaziz Univ, Princess Al Jawhara Albrahim Ctr Excellence Res H, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia; [Wang, Jun] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Wang, Jun] Macau Univ Sci & Technol, Macao 999078, Peoples R China; [Borch-Johnsen, Knut] Holbaek Cent Hosp, DK-4300 Holbaek, Denmark; [Nielsen, Rasmus] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Stat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Hansen, Torben] Univ Southern Denmark, Fac Hlth Sci, DK-5000 Odense, Denmark",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13425,Article,1476-4687,albrecht@binf.ku.dk; torben.hansen@sund.ku.dk,+,Novo Nordisk Foundation; Danish Council for Independent Research (Medical Sciences); Steno Diabetes Center; Villum Foundation; Karen Elise Jensen's Foundation; NunaFonden; Medical Research Council of Denmark; Medical Research Council of Greenland; Commission for Scientific Research in Greenland,"We thank I.

136,50,254.0,"The vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) are major angiogenic regulators and are involved in several aspects of endothelial cell physiology(1). However, the detailed role of VEGF-B in blood vessel function has remained unclear(2,3). Here we show that VEGF-B has an unexpected role in endothelial targeting of lipids to peripheral tissues. Dietary lipids present in circulation have to be transported through the vascular endothelium to be metabolized by tissue cells, a mechanism that is poorly understood(4). Bioinformatic analysis showed that Vegfb was tightly co-expressed with nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes across a large variety of physiological conditions in mice, pointing to a role for VEGF-B in metabolism. VEGF-B specifically controlled endothelial uptake of fatty acids via transcriptional regulation of vascular fatty acid transport proteins. As a consequence, Vegfb(-/-) mice showed less uptake and accumulation of lipids in muscle, heart and brown adipose tissue, and instead shunted lipids to white adipose tissue. This regulation was mediated by VEGF receptor 1 and neuropilin 1 expressed by the endothelium. The co-expression of VEGF-B and mitochondrial proteins introduces a novel regulatory mechanism, whereby endothelial lipid uptake and mitochondrial lipid use are tightly coordinated. The involvement of VEGF-B in lipid uptake may open up the possibility for novel strategies to modulate pathological lipid accumulation in diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular diseases.","Hagberg, Carolina E.; Falkevall, Annelie; Wang, Xun; Larsson, Erik; Huusko, Jenni; Nilsson, Ingrid; van Meeteren, Laurens A.; Samen, Erik; Lu, Li; Vanwildemeersch, Maarten; Klar, Joakim; Genove, Guillem; Pietras, Kristian; Stone-Elander, Sharon; Claesson-Welsh, Lena; Yla-Herttuala, Seppo; Lindahl, Per; Eriksson, Ulf","Hagberg, CE; Falkevall, A; Wang, X; Larsson, E; Huusko, J; Nilsson, I; van Meeteren, LA; Samen, E; Lu, L; Vanwildemeersch, M; Klar, J; Genove, G; Pietras, K; Stone-Elander, S; Claesson-Welsh, L; Yla-Herttuala, S; Lindahl, P; Eriksson, U",917.0,"[Hagberg, Carolina E.; Falkevall, Annelie; Wang, Xun; Nilsson, Ingrid; Vanwildemeersch, Maarten; Pietras, Kristian; Eriksson, Ulf] Karolinska Inst, Tissue Biol Grp, Div Matrix Biol, Dept Med Biochem & Biophys, SE-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Hagberg, Carolina E.; Falkevall, Annelie; Wang, Xun; Vanwildemeersch, Maarten; Klar, Joakim; Pietras, Kristian; Eriksson, Ulf] Ludwig Inst Canc Res Ltd, Stockholm Branch, Karolinska Inst, SE-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Larsson, Erik; Lindahl, Per] Univ Gothenburg, Inst Biomed, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Huusko, Jenni; Yla-Herttuala, Seppo] Univ Kuopio, AI Virtanen Inst, Dept Biotechnol & Mol Med, FIN-70211 Kuopio, Finland; [van Meeteren, Laurens A.; Klar, Joakim; Claesson-Welsh, Lena] Uppsala Univ, Rudbeck Lab, Dept Genet & Pathol, SE-75185 Uppsala, Sweden; [Samen, Erik; Stone-Elander, Sharon] Karolinska Pharm, Karolinska Univ Hosp, SE-17176 Stockholm, Sweden; [Samen, Erik; Lu, Li; Stone-Elander, Sharon] Karolinska Inst, SE-17176 Stockholm, Sweden; [Genove, Guillem] Karolinska Inst, Lab Vasc Biol, Div Matrix Biol, Dept Med Biochem & Biophys, SE-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Lindahl, Per] Sahlgrens Univ Hosp, Wallenberg Lab Cardiovasc Res, SE-41345 Gothenburg, Sweden",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08945,Article,,ulf.pe.eriksson@ki.se,U136,Wilhelm och Else Stockmanns Stiftelse; Frans Wilhelm och Waldemar von Frenckells fond; European Commission [LSHG-CT-2004-503573]; Dutch Cancer Society; Novo Nordisk Foundation; Swedish Cancer Foundation; Swedish Research Council; Dr. Peter Wallenbergs Foundation for Economics and Technology; LeDucq Foundation; Swedish Brain Foundation and Hallstens Forskningsstiftelse; Karolinska Institutet,"We thank S.

137,420,259.0,"Defects in insulin signalling are among the most common and earliest defects that predispose an individual to the development of type 2 diabetes(1-3). MicroRNAs have been identified as a new class of regulatory molecules that influence many biological functions, including metabolism(4,5). However, the direct regulation of insulin sensitivity by microRNAs in vivo has not been demonstrated. Here we show that the expression of microRNAs 103 and 107 (miR-103/107) is upregulated in obese mice. Silencing of miR-103/107 leads to improved glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. In contrast, gain of miR-103/107 function in either liver or fat is sufficient to induce impaired glucose homeostasis. We identify caveolin-1, a critical regulator of the insulin receptor, as a direct target gene of miR-103/107. We demonstrate that caveolin-1 is upregulated upon miR-103/107 inactivation in adipocytes and that this is concomitant with stabilization of the insulin receptor, enhanced insulin signalling, decreased adipocyte size and enhanced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. These findings demonstrate the central importance of miR-103/107 to insulin sensitivity and identify a new target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity.","Trajkovski, Mirko; Hausser, Jean; Soutschek, Juergen; Bhat, Bal; Akin, Akinc; Zavolan, Mihaela; Heim, Markus H.; Stoffel, Markus","Trajkovski, M; Hausser, J; Soutschek, J; Bhat, B; Akin, A; Zavolan, M; Heim, MH; Stoffel, M",649.0,"[Trajkovski, Mirko; Hausser, Jean; Heim, Markus H.; Stoffel, Markus] ETH, Competence Ctr Syst Physiol & Metab Dis, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Trajkovski, Mirko; Stoffel, Markus] ETH, Inst Mol Syst Biol, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Hausser, Jean; Zavolan, Mihaela] Univ Basel, Biozentrum Basel, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; [Soutschek, Juergen; Bhat, Bal] Regulus Therapeut Inc, San Diego, CA 92121 USA; [Akin, Akinc] Alnylam Pharmaceut, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Heim, Markus H.] Univ Basel Hosp, CH-4031 Basel, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10112,Article,,stoffel@imsb.biol.ethz.ch,U127,Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF); European Community; Leducq Foundation,"We would like to thank F.

138,361,354.0,"The herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM), a member of the tumour-necrosis factor receptor family, has diverse functions, augmenting or inhibiting the immune response(1). HVEM was recently reported as a colitis risk locus in patients(2), and in a mouse model of colitis we demonstrated an anti-inflammatory role for HVEM3, but its mechanism of action in the mucosal immune system was unknown. Here we report an important role for epithelial HVEM in innate mucosal defence against pathogenic bacteria. HVEM enhances immune responses by NF-kappa B-inducing kinase-dependent Stat3 activation, which promotes the epithelial expression of genes important for immunity. During intestinal Citrobacter rodentium infection(4-6), a mouse model for enteropathogenic Escherichia coli infection, Hvem(-/-) mice showed decreased Stat3 activation, impaired responses in the colon, higher bacterial burdens and increased mortality. We identified the immunoglobulin superfamily molecule CD160 (refs 7 and 8), expressed predominantly by innate-like intraepithelial lymphocytes, as the ligand engaging epithelial HVEM for host protection. Likewise, in pulmonary Streptococcus pneumoniae infection(9), HVEM is also required for host defence. Our results pinpoint HVEM as an important orchestrator of mucosal immunity, integrating signals from innate lymphocytes to induce optimal epithelial Stat3 activation, which indicates that targeting HVEM with agonists could improve host defence.","Shui, Jr-Wen; Larange, Alexandre; Kim, Gisen; Vela, Jose Luis; Zahner, Sonja; Cheroutre, Hilde; Kronenberg, Mitchell","Shui, JW; Larange, A; Kim, G; Vela, JL; Zahner, S; Cheroutre, H; Kronenberg, M",222.0,"[Shui, Jr-Wen; Larange, Alexandre; Kim, Gisen; Vela, Jose Luis; Zahner, Sonja; Cheroutre, Hilde; Kronenberg, Mitchell] La Jolla Inst Allergy & Immunol, Div Dev Immunol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11242,Article,,mitch@liai.org,+,"National Institutes of Health [RO1-AI061516, PO1 DK46763, F32-DK082249, F32-AI083029]; La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology; Center for Infectious Disease [LIAI-JAN-2011-CID]","This work was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (RO1-AI061516 to M.

139,418,234.0,"Heavy-metal homeostasis and detoxification is crucial for cell viability. P-type ATPases of the class IB (PIB) are essential in these processes, actively extruding heavy metals from the cytoplasm of cells. Here we present the structure of a PIB-ATPase, a Legionella pneumophila CopA Cu+-ATPase, in a copper-free form, as determined by X-ray crystallography at 3.2 angstrom resolution. The structure indicates a three-stage copper transport pathway involving several conserved residues. A PIB-specific transmembrane helix kinks at a double-glycine motif displaying an amphipathic helix that lines a putative copper entry point at the intracellular interface. Comparisons to Ca2+-ATPase suggest an ATPase-coupled copper release mechanism from the binding sites in the membrane via an extracellular exit site. The structure also provides a framework to analyse missense mutations in the human ATP7A and ATP7B proteins associated with Menkes' and Wilson's diseases.","Gourdon, Pontus; Liu, Xiang-Yu; Skjorringe, Tina; Morth, J.

140,190,28.0,"The derivation of human embryonic stem (hES) cells currently requires the destruction of ex utero embryos(1-4). A previous study in mice indicates that it might be possible to generate embryonic stem (ES) cells using a single-cell biopsy similar to that used in preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), which does not interfere with the embryo's developmental potential(5). By growing the single blastomere overnight, the resulting cells could be used for both genetic testing and stem cell derivation without affecting the clinical outcome of the procedure. Here we report a series of ten separate experiments demonstrating that hES cells can be derived from single blastomeres. In this proof-of-principle study, multiple biopsies were taken from each embryo using micromanipulation techniques and none of the biopsied embryos were allowed to develop in culture. Nineteen ES-cell-like outgrowths and two stable hES cell lines were obtained. The latter hES cell lines maintained undifferentiated proliferation for more than eight months, and showed normal karyotype and expression of markers of pluri-potency, including Oct-4, SSEA-3, SSEA-4, TRA-1-60, TRA-1-81, nanog and alkaline phosphatase. These cells retained the potential to form derivatives of all three embryonic germ layers both in vitro and in teratomas. The ability to create new stem cell lines and therapies without destroying embryos would address the ethical concerns of many, and allow the generation of matched tissue for children and siblings born from transferred PGD embryos.","Klimanskaya, Irina; Chung, Young; Becker, Sandy; Lu, Shi-Jiang; Lanza, Robert","Klimanskaya, I; Chung, Y; Becker, S; Lu, SJ; Lanza, R",481.0,"Adv Cell Technol, Worcester, MA 01605 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature05142,Article,,rlanza@advancedcell.com,485,,,108BQ,,,MOUSE BLASTOMERES; HUMAN BLASTOCYSTS; IN-VITRO; STAGE; DERIVATION; EXPRESSION; DIAGNOSIS; BIOPSY; DNA,7118.0,NATURE,Nature,English,27.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",23-Nov,5.0,LONDON,16929302.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,,"Lanza, R (reprint author), Adv Cell Technol, 381 Plantat St, Worcester, MA 01605 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,312.0,Human embryonic stem cell lines derived from single blastomeres,1.0,54.0,WOS:000242215700045,28.0,444,Multidisciplinary Sciences,329,robert,lanza,20043.0,5222,male,1.0,Yd5M244AAAAJ,5,"(17929, ]",6030768,1,6030768,1,Robert Lanza,Robert Lanza,1,1
141,21,360.0,"The ability to produce vigorous immune responses that spare self tissues and organs depends on the elimination of autoreactive T and B cells. However, purging of immature and mature self-reactive T and B cells is incomplete and may also require the involvement of cells programmed to suppress immune responses(1). Regulatory T cells (T-reg) belonging to the CD4(+) T-cell subset may have a role in preventing untoward inflammatory responses, but T-cell subsets programmed to inhibit the development of autoantibody formation and systemic-lupus-erythematosus-like disease have not yet been defined(2). Here we delineate a CD8(+) regulatory T-cell lineage that is essential for the maintenance of self tolerance and prevention of murine autoimmune disease. Genetic disruption of the inhibitory interaction between these CD8(+) T cells and their target Qa-1(+) follicular T-helper cells results in the development of a lethal systemic-lupus-erythematosus-like autoimmune disease. These findings define a sublineage of CD8 T cells programmed to suppress rather than activate immunity that represents an essential regulatory element of the immune response and a guarantor of self tolerance.","Kim, Hye-Jung; Verbinnen, Bert; Tang, Xiaolei; Lu, Linrong; Cantor, Harvey","Kim, HJ; Verbinnen, B; Tang, XL; Lu, LR; Cantor, H",328.0,"[Kim, Hye-Jung; Verbinnen, Bert; Tang, Xiaolei; Cantor, Harvey] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Immunol & AIDS, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Kim, Hye-Jung; Verbinnen, Bert; Tang, Xiaolei; Cantor, Harvey] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Lu, Linrong] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Med, Inst Immunol, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09370,Article,,Harvey_Cantor@dfci.harvard.edu,U107,"NIH [AI 037562]; Lupus Research Institute; Schecter Research Foundation; National Research Service [DFCI/NCI T32 CA070083, HSPH/NCI T32 CA009382]; Belgian American Educational Foundation","We thank R.

142,364,383.0,"Viruses must enter host cells to replicate, assemble and propagate. Because of the restricted size of their genomes, viruses have had to evolve efficient ways of exploiting host cell processes to promote their own life cycles and also to escape host immune defence mechanisms(1,2). Many viral open reading frames (viORFs) with immune-modulating functions essential for productive viral growth have been identified across a range of viral classes(3,4). However, there has been no comprehensive study to identify the host factors with which these viORFs interact for a global perspective of viral perturbation strategies(5-11). Here we show that different viral perturbation patterns of the host molecular defence network can be deduced from a mass-spectrometry-based host-factor survey in a defined human cellular system by using 70 innate immune-modulating viORFs from 30 viral species. The 579 host proteins targeted by the viORFs mapped to an unexpectedly large number of signalling pathways and cellular processes, suggesting yet unknown mechanisms of antiviral immunity.

143,433,426.0,"Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare and fatal human premature ageing disease(1-5), characterized by premature arteriosclerosis and degeneration of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs)(6-8). HGPS is caused by a single point mutation in the lamin A (LMNA) gene, resulting in the generation of progerin, a truncated splicing mutant of lamin A. Accumulation of progerin leads to various ageing-associated nuclear defects including disorganization of nuclear lamina and loss of heterochromatin(9-12). Here we report the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from fibroblasts obtained from patients with HGPS. HGPS-iPSCs show absence of progerin, and more importantly, lack the nuclear envelope and epigenetic alterations normally associated with premature ageing. Upon differentiation of HGPS-iPSCs, progerin and its ageing-associated phenotypic consequences are restored. Specifically, directed differentiation of HGPS-iPSCs to SMCs leads to the appearance of premature senescence phenotypes associated with vascular ageing. Additionally, our studies identify DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNAPKcs, also known as PRKDC) as a downstream target of progerin. The absence of nuclear DNAPK holoenzyme correlates with premature as well as physiological ageing. Because progerin also accumulates during physiological ageing(6,12,13), our results provide an in vitro iPSC-based model to study the pathogenesis of human premature and physiological vascular ageing.","Liu, Guang-Hui; Barkho, Basam Z.; Ruiz, Sergio; Diep, Dinh; Qu, Jing; Yang, Sheng-Lian; Panopoulos, Athanasia D.; Suzuki, Keiichiro; Kurian, Leo; Walsh, Christopher; Thompson, James; Boue, Stephanie; Fung, Ho Lim; Sancho-Martinez, Ignacio; Zhang, Kun; Yates, John, III; Izpisua Belmonte, Juan Carlos","Liu, GH; Barkho, BZ; Ruiz, S; Diep, D; Qu, J; Yang, SL; Panopoulos, AD; Suzuki, K; Kurian, L; Walsh, C; Thompson, J; Boue, S; Fung, HL; Sancho-Martinez, I; Zhang, K; Yates, J; Belmonte, JCI",221.0,"[Liu, Guang-Hui; Barkho, Basam Z.; Ruiz, Sergio; Qu, Jing; Yang, Sheng-Lian; Panopoulos, Athanasia D.; Suzuki, Keiichiro; Kurian, Leo; Walsh, Christopher; Sancho-Martinez, Ignacio; Izpisua Belmonte, Juan Carlos] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Gene Express Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Diep, Dinh; Fung, Ho Lim; Zhang, Kun] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Bioengn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Thompson, James; Yates, John, III] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Cell Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Boue, Stephanie; Izpisua Belmonte, Juan Carlos] Ctr Regenerat Med Barcelona, Barcelona 08003, Spain",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09879,Article,1476-4687,belmonte@salk.edu,225,"CIRM [TG2-01158]; AFAR/Ellison Medical Foundation; NIH [T32 CA009370, R01-DA025779, P41 RR011823]; G.

144,54,298.0,"Cellular senescence has been recently shown to have an important role in opposing tumour initiation and promotion. Senescence induced by oncogenes or by loss of tumour suppressor genes is thought to critically depend on induction of the p19(Arf)-p53 pathway. The Skp2 E3-ubiquitin ligase can act as a proto-oncogene and its aberrant overexpression is frequently observed in human cancers. Here we show that although Skp2 inactivation on its own does not induce cellular senescence, aberrant proto-oncogenic signals as well as inactivation of tumour suppressor genes do trigger a potent, tumour-suppressive senescence response in mice and cells devoid of Skp2. Notably, Skp2 inactivation and oncogenic-stress-driven senescence neither elicit activation of the p19(Arf)-p53 pathway nor DNA damage, but instead depend on Atf4, p27 and p21. We further demonstrate that genetic Skp2 inactivation evokes cellular senescence even in oncogenic conditions in which the p19(Arf)-p53 response is impaired, whereas a Skp2-SCF complex inhibitor can trigger cellular senescence in p53/Pten-deficient cells and tumour regression in preclinical studies. Our findings therefore provide proof-of-principle evidence that pharmacological inhibition of Skp2 may represent a general approach for cancer prevention and therapy.","Lin, Hui-Kuan; Chen, Zhenbang; Wang, Guocan; Nardella, Caterina; Lee, Szu-Wei; Chan, Chan-Hsin; Yang, Wei-Lei; Wang, Jing; Egia, Ainara; Nakayama, Keiichi I.; Cordon-Cardo, Carlos; Teruya-Feldstein, Julie; Pandolfi, Pier Paolo","Lin, HK; Chen, ZB; Wang, GC; Nardella, C; Lee, SW; Chan, CH; Yang, WL; Wang, J; Egia, A; Nakayama, KI; Cordon-Cardo, C; Teruya-Feldstein, J; Pandolfi, PP",374.0,"[Lin, Hui-Kuan; Chen, Zhenbang; Wang, Guocan; Nardella, Caterina; Pandolfi, Pier Paolo] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Sloan Kettering Inst, Canc Biol & Genet Program, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Lin, Hui-Kuan; Chen, Zhenbang; Wang, Guocan; Nardella, Caterina; Cordon-Cardo, Carlos; Teruya-Feldstein, Julie; Pandolfi, Pier Paolo] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Sloan Kettering Inst, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Lin, Hui-Kuan; Lee, Szu-Wei; Chan, Chan-Hsin; Yang, Wei-Lei; Wang, Jing] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Mol & Cellular Oncol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Chen, Zhenbang; Wang, Guocan; Nardella, Caterina; Egia, Ainara] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Chen, Zhenbang; Wang, Guocan; Nardella, Caterina; Egia, Ainara] Beth Israel Deaconess Canc Ctr, Canc Genet Program, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Nakayama, Keiichi I.] Kyushu Univ, Med Inst Bioregulat, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Fukuoka 8128582, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08815,Article,,ppandolf@bidmc.harvard.edu,U66,NIH; Anderson Trust Scholar Award; DOD Prostate Cancer New Investigator Award,"We are grateful to C.

145,219,242.0,"Macromolecular complexes are essential to conserved biological processes, but their prevalence across animals is unclear. By combining extensive biochemical fractionation with quantitative mass spectrometry, here we directly examined the composition of soluble multiprotein complexes among diverse metazoan models. Using an integrative approach, we generated a draft conservation map consisting of more than one million putative high-confidence co-complex interactions for species with fully sequenced genomes that encompasses functional modules present broadly across all extant animals. Clustering reveals a spectrum of conservation, ranging from ancient eukaryotic assemblies that have probably served cellular housekeeping roles for at least one billion years, ancestral complexes that have accrued contemporary components, and rarer metazoan innovations linked to multicellularity. We validated these projections by independent co-fractionation experiments in evolutionarily distant species, affinity purification and functional analyses. The comprehensiveness, centrality and modularity of these reconstructed interactomes reflect their fundamental mechanistic importance and adaptive value to animal cell systems.","Wan, Cuihong; Borgeson, Blake; Phanse, Sadhna; Tu, Fan; Drew, Kevin; Clark, Greg; Xiong, Xuejian; Kagan, Olga; Kwan, Julian; Bezginov, Alexandr; Chessman, Kyle; Pal, Swati; Cromar, Graham; Papoulas, Ophelia; Ni, Zuyao; Boutz, Daniel R.; Stoilova, Snejana; Havugimana, Pierre C.; Guo, Xinghua; Malty, Ramy H.; Sarov, Mihail; Greenblatt, Jack; Babu, Mohan; Derry, W.

146,238,90.0,"The ubiquitination of cell cycle regulatory proteins by the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome(APC/C) controls sister chromatid segregation, cytokinesis and the establishment of the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The APC/C is an unusually large multimeric cullin-RING ligase. Its activity is strictly dependent on regulatory coactivator subunits that promote APC/C-substrate interactions and stimulate its catalytic reaction. Because the structures of many APC/C subunits and their organization within the assembly are unknown, the molecular basis for these processes is poorly understood. Here, from a cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction of a human APC/C-coactivator-substrate complex at 7.4 angstrom resolution, we have determined the complete secondary structural architecture of the complex. With this information we identified protein folds for structurally uncharacterized subunits, and the definitive location of all 20 APC/C subunits within the 1.2 MDa assembly. Comparison with apo APC/C shows that the coactivator promotes a profound allosteric transition involving displacement of the cullin-RING catalytic subunits relative to the degron-recognition module of coactivator and APC10. This transition is accompanied by increased flexibility of the cullin-RING subunits and enhanced affinity for UBCH10-ubiquitin, changes which may contribute to coactivator-mediated stimulation of APC/C E3 ligase activity.","Chang, Leifu; Zhang, Ziguo; Yang, Jing; McLaughlin, Stephen H.; Barford, David","Chang, LF; Zhang, ZG; Yang, J; McLaughlin, SH; Barford, D",388.0,"[Chang, Leifu; Zhang, Ziguo; Yang, Jing; Barford, David] Inst Canc Res, Div Struct Biol, London SW3 6JB, England; [Chang, Leifu; Zhang, Ziguo; Yang, Jing; McLaughlin, Stephen H.; Barford, David] MRC Lab Mol Biol, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13543,Article,1476-4687,dbarford@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk,+,Cancer Research UK,We thank P. da Fonseca for her guidance preparing cryo electron microscopy grids and X.

147,414,168.0,"Somatic cell nuclear transfer, cell fusion, or expression of lineage-specific factors have been shown to induce cell-fate changes in diverse somatic cell types(1-12). We recently observed that forced expression of a combination of three transcription factors, Brn2 (also known as Pou3f2), Ascl1 and Myt1l, can efficiently convert mouse fibroblasts into functional induced neuronal (iN) cells(13). Here we show that the same three factors can generate functional neurons from human pluripotent stem cells as early as 6 days after transgene activation. When combined with the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor NeuroD1, these factors could also convert fetal and postnatal human fibroblasts into iN cells showing typical neuronal morphologies and expressing multiple neuronal markers, even after downregulation of the exogenous transcription factors. Importantly, the vast majority of human iN cells were able to generate action potentials and many matured to receive synaptic contacts when co-cultured with primary mouse cortical neurons. Our data demonstrate that non-neural human somatic cells, as well as pluripotent stem cells, can be converted directly into neurons by lineage-determining transcription factors. These methods may facilitate robust generation of patient-specific human neurons for in vitro disease modelling or future applications in regenerative medicine.","Pang, Zhiping P.; Yang, Nan; Vierbuchen, Thomas; Ostermeier, Austin; Fuentes, Daniel R.; Yang, Troy Q.; Citri, Ami; Sebastiano, Vittorio; Marro, Samuele; Suedhof, Thomas C.; Wernig, Marius","Pang, ZPP; Yang, N; Vierbuchen, T; Ostermeier, A; Fuentes, DR; Yang, TQ; Citri, A; Sebastiano, V; Marro, S; Sudhof, TC; Wernig, M",220.0,"[Yang, Nan; Vierbuchen, Thomas; Ostermeier, Austin; Fuentes, Daniel R.; Yang, Troy Q.; Sebastiano, Vittorio; Marro, Samuele; Wernig, Marius] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Inst Stem Cell Biol & Regenerat Med, Dept Pathol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Pang, Zhiping P.; Suedhof, Thomas C.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Physiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Vierbuchen, Thomas; Ostermeier, Austin; Wernig, Marius] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Program Canc Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Citri, Ami] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Suedhof, Thomas C.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10202,Article,,wernig@stanford.edu,U122,"Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine at Stanford; Ellison Medical Foundation; Stinehard-Reed Foundation; Donald E. and Delia B.

148,278,118.0,"Although a few cancer genes are mutated in a high proportion of tumours of a given type (>20%), most are mutated at intermediate frequencies (2-20%). To explore the feasibility of creating a comprehensive catalogue of cancer genes, we analysed somatic point mutations in exome sequences from 4,742 human cancers and their matched normal-tissue samples across 21 cancer types. We found that large-scale genomic analysis can identify nearly all known cancer genes in these tumour types. Our analysis also identified 33 genes that were not previously known to be significantly mutated in cancer, including genes related to proliferation, apoptosis, genome stability, chromatin regulation, immune evasion, RNA processing and protein homeostasis. Down-sampling analysis indicates that larger sample sizes will reveal many more genes mutated at clinically important frequencies. We estimate that near-saturation may be achieved with 6005,000 samples per tumour type, depending on background mutation frequency. The results may help to guide the next stage of cancer genomics.","Lawrence, Michael S.; Stojanov, Petar; Mermel, Craig H.; Robinson, James T.; Garraway, Levi A.; Golub, Todd R.; Meyerson, Matthew; Gabriel, Stacey B.; Lander, Eric S.; Getz, Gad","Lawrence, MS; Stojanov, P; Mermel, CH; Robinson, JT; Garraway, LA; Golub, TR; Meyerson, M; Gabriel, SB; Lander, ES; Getz, G",495.0,"[Lawrence, Michael S.; Stojanov, Petar; Mermel, Craig H.; Robinson, James T.; Garraway, Levi A.; Golub, Todd R.; Meyerson, Matthew; Gabriel, Stacey B.; Lander, Eric S.; Getz, Gad] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge Ctr 7, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Stojanov, Petar; Garraway, Levi A.; Golub, Todd R.; Meyerson, Matthew] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Mermel, Craig H.; Getz, Gad] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Canc, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Mermel, Craig H.; Getz, Gad] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Garraway, Levi A.; Golub, Todd R.; Meyerson, Matthew; Lander, Eric S.; Getz, Gad] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Golub, Todd R.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chevy Chase, MD 20815 USA; [Lander, Eric S.] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12912,Article,1476-4687,lander@broadinstitute.org; gadgetz@broadinstitute.org,+,Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NCI NIH HHS [R01 CA157304]; NHGRI NIH HHS [U54 HG003067]; NIGMS NIH HHS [T32 GM007753],,293SW,Y,N,MUTATIONS; HALLMARKS; GENOME,7484.0,NATURE,Nature,English,13.0,No,"Meyerson, Matthew/0000-0002-9133-8108","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",23-Jan,9.0,LONDON,24390350.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2014.0,,"Lander, ES (reprint author), Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge Ctr 7, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,871.0,Discovery and saturation analysis of cancer genes across 21 tumour types,15.0,191.0,WOS:000329995000029,118.0,505,Multidisciplinary Sciences,885,gad,getz,92290.0,13,male,1.0,q-KRzawAAAAJ,5,"(17929, ]",35304421,1,15181775,1,Jobs (film),Jobs (film),0,0
149,343,122.0,"Calcium ions (Ca2+) have an important role as secondary messengers in numerous signal transduction processes(1-4), and cells invest much energy in controlling and maintaining a steep gradient between intracellular (similar to 0.1-micromolar) and extracellular (similar to 2-millimolar) Ca2+ concentrations(1). Calmodulin-stimulated calcium pumps, which include the plasma-membrane Ca2+-ATPases (PMCAs), are key regulators of intracellular Ca2+ in eukaryotes(5-8). They contain a unique amino- or carboxy-terminal regulatory domain responsible for autoinhibition, and binding of calcium-loaded calmodulin to this domain releases autoinhibition and activates the pump. However, the structural basis for the activation mechanism is unknown and a key remaining question is how calmodulin-mediated PMCA regulation can cover both basal Ca2+ levels in the nanomolar range as well as micromolar-range Ca2+ transients generated by cell stimulation(7). Here we present an integrated study combining the determination of the high-resolution crystal structure of a PMCA regulatory-domain/calmodulin complex with in vivo characterization and biochemical, biophysical and bioinformatics data that provide mechanistic insights into a two-step PMCA activation mechanism mediated by calcium-loaded calmodulin. The structure shows the entire PMCA regulatory domain and reveals an unexpected 2: 1 stoichiometry with two calcium-loaded calmodulin molecules binding to different sites on a long helix. A multifaceted characterization of the role of both sites leads to a general structural-model for calmodulin-mediated regulation of PMCAs that allows stringent, highly responsive control of intracellular calcium in eukaryotes, making it possible to maintain a stable, basal level at a threshold Ca2+ concentration, where steep activation occurs.","Tidow, Henning; Poulsen, Lisbeth R.; Andreeva, Antonina; Knudsen, Michael; Hein, Kim L.; Wiuf, Carsten; Palmgren, Michael G.; Nissen, Poul","Tidow, H; Poulsen, LR; Andreeva, A; Knudsen, M; Hein, KL; Wiuf, C; Palmgren, MG; Nissen, P",468.0,"[Tidow, Henning; Poulsen, Lisbeth R.; Knudsen, Michael; Hein, Kim L.; Palmgren, Michael G.; Nissen, Poul] Aarhus Univ, Ctr Membrane Pumps Cells & Dis PUMPKIN, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Tidow, Henning; Hein, Kim L.; Nissen, Poul] Aarhus Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Poulsen, Lisbeth R.; Palmgren, Michael G.] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Plant Biol & Biotechnol, DK-1871 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Andreeva, Antonina] MRC Lab Mol Biol, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England; [Knudsen, Michael] Aarhus Univ, Bioinformat Res Ctr, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Wiuf, Carsten] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Math Sci, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11539,Article,,palmgren@life.ku.dk; pn@mb.au.dk,+,EMBO Long-Term Fellowship; Marie-Curie Intra-European Fellowship; HFSP Long-Term Fellowship; ERC advanced grant (BIOMEMOS),"We thank members of the Nissen and Palmgren labs for discussions, and P.

150,170,221.0,"Periodic mesoporous materials formed through the cooperative self-assembly of surfactants and framework building blocks can assume a variety of structures(1-3), and their widely tuneable properties make them attractive hosts for numerous applications(4-7). Because the molecular movement in the pore system is the most important and defining characteristic of porous materials(8), it is of interest to learn about this behaviour as a function of local structure. Generally, individual fluorescent dye molecules can be used as molecular beacons with which to explore the structure of-and the dynamics within-these porous hosts(9-13), and single-molecule fluorescence techniques provide detailed insights into the dynamics of various processes, ranging from biology(14,15) to heterogeneous catalysis(16). However, optical microscopy methods cannot directly image the mesoporous structure of the host system accommodating the diffusing molecules, whereas transmission electron microscopy provides detailed images of the porous structure(17), but no dynamic information. It has therefore not been possible to 'see' how molecules diffuse in a real nanoscale pore structure. Here we present a combination of electron microscopic mapping and optical single-molecule tracking experiments to reveal how a single luminescent dye molecule travels through linear or strongly curved sections of a mesoporous channel system. In our approach we directly correlate porous structures detected by transmission electron microscopy with the diffusion dynamics of single molecules detected by optical microscopy. This opens up new ways of understanding the interactions of host and guest.","Zuerner, Andreas; Kirstein, Johanna; Doeblinger, Markus; Braeuchle, Christoph; Bein, Thomas","Zurner, A; Kirstein, J; Doblinger, M; Brauchle, C; Bein, T",705.0,"Univ Munich, Dept Chem & Biochem, D-81377 Munich, Germany; Univ Munich, Ctr NanoSci, D-81377 Munich, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06398,Article,,bein@lmu.de,+,,,235BY,,,SILICA; DYNAMICS; TRACKING; PORES; FILMS,7170.0,NATURE,Nature,English,21.0,No,"Bein, Thomas/0000-0001-7248-5906","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",29-Nov,5.0,LONDON,18046407.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007.0,"Bein, Thomas/G-7686-2014","Zurner, A (reprint author), Univ Munich, Dept Chem & Biochem, Butenandtstr 5-13 E, D-81377 Munich, Germany.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,134.0,Visualizing single-molecule diffusion in mesoporous materials,6.0,114.0,WOS:000251209700050,221.0,450,Multidisciplinary Sciences,134,thomas,bein,28289.0,3753,male,1.0,gU1pu4kAAAAJ,5,"(17929, ]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
151,236,44.0,"The response of the terrestrial carbon cycle to climate change is among the largest uncertainties affecting future climate change projections(1,2). The feedback between the terrestrial carbon cycle and climate is partly determined by changes in the turnover time of carbon in land ecosystems, which in turn is an ecosystem property that emerges from the interplay between climate, soil and vegetation type(3-6). Here we present a global, spatially explicit and observation-based assessment of whole-ecosystem carbon turnover times that combines new estimates of vegetation and soil organic carbon stocks and fluxes. We find that the overall mean global carbon turnover time is 23(4)(+7) years (95 per cent confidence interval). Onaverage, carbon resides in the vegetation and soil near the Equator for a shorter time than at latitudes north of 75 degrees north (mean turnover times of 15 and 255 years, respectively). We identify a clear dependence of the turnover time on temperature, as expected from our present understanding of temperature controls on ecosystem dynamics. Surprisingly, our analysis also reveals a similarly strong association between turnover time and precipitation. Moreover, we find that the ecosystem carbon turnover times simulated by state-of-the-art coupled climate/carbon-cycle models vary widely and that numerical simulations, on average, tend to underestimate the global carbon turnover time by 36 per cent. The models show stronger spatial relationships with temperature than do observation-based estimates, but generally do not reproduce the strong relationships with precipitation and predict faster carbon turnover in many semiarid regions. Our findings suggest that future climate/carbon-cycle feedbacks may depend more strongly on changes in the hydrological cycle than is expected at present and is considered in Earth system models.","Carvalhais, Nuno; Forkel, Matthias; Khomik, Myroslava; Bellarby, Jessica; Jung, Martin; Migliavacca, Mirco; Mu, Mingquan; Saatchi, Sassan; Santoro, Maurizio; Thurner, Martin; Weber, Ulrich; Ahrens, Bernhard; Beer, Christian; Cescatti, Alessandro; Randerson, James T.; Reichstein, Markus","Carvalhais, N; Forkel, M; Khomik, M; Bellarby, J; Jung, M; Migliavacca, M; Mu, MQ; Saatchi, S; Santoro, M; Thurner, M; Weber, U; Ahrens, B; Beer, C; Cescatti, A; Randerson, JT; Reichstein, M",213.0,"[Carvalhais, Nuno; Forkel, Matthias; Khomik, Myroslava; Jung, Martin; Migliavacca, Mirco; Thurner, Martin; Weber, Ulrich; Ahrens, Bernhard; Beer, Christian; Reichstein, Markus] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Carvalhais, Nuno] Univ Nova Lisboa, FCT, DCEA, P-2829516 Caparica, Portugal; [Khomik, Myroslava] McMaster Univ, Sch Geog & Earth Sci, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada; [Bellarby, Jessica] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, Aberdeen AB24 3UU, Scotland; [Bellarby, Jessica] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England; [Migliavacca, Mirco] Univ Milano Bicocca, DISAT, Remote Sensing Environm Dynam Lab, I-20126 Milan, Italy; [Mu, Mingquan; Randerson, James T.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Saatchi, Sassan] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA; [Santoro, Maurizio] Gamma Remote Sensing, CH-3073 Gumlingen, Switzerland; [Beer, Christian] Stockholm Univ, Dept Appl Environm Sci, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Beer, Christian] Stockholm Univ, Bolin Ctr Climate Res, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Cescatti, Alessandro] Commiss European Communities, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Climate Risk Management Unit, I-21027 Ispra, Italy",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13731,Article,1476-4687,nuno.carvalhais@bgc-jena.mpg.de,+,European Union (FP7) through the project GEOCARBON [283080]; ERC starting grant QUASOM [ERC-2007-StG-208516]; European Union (FP7) through the project CARBONES [242316]; European Union (FP7) through the project EMBRACE [283201],"We would like to thank C.

152,53,291.0,"Although mammalian hearts show almost no ability to regenerate, there is a growing initiative to determine whether existing cardiomyocytes or progenitor cells can be coaxed into eliciting a regenerative response. In contrast to mammals, several non-mammalian vertebrate species are able to regenerate their hearts(1-3), including the zebrafish(4,5), which can fully regenerate its heart after amputation of up to 20% of the ventricle. To address directly the source of newly formed cardiomyocytes during zebrafish heart regeneration, we first established a genetic strategy to trace the lineage of cardiomyocytes in the adult fish, on the basis of the Cre/lox system widely used in the mouse(6). Here we use this system to show that regenerated heart muscle cells are derived from the proliferation of differentiated cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, we show that proliferating cardiomyocytes undergo limited dedifferentiation characterized by the disassembly of their sarcomeric structure, detachment from one another and the expression of regulators of cell-cycle progression. Specifically, we show that the gene product of polo-like kinase 1 (plk1) is an essential component of cardiomyocyte proliferation during heart regeneration. Our data provide the first direct evidence for the source of proliferating cardiomyocytes during zebrafish heart regeneration and indicate that stem or progenitor cells are not significantly involved in this process.","Jopling, Chris; Sleep, Eduard; Raya, Marina; Marti, Merce; Raya, Angel; Izpisua Belmonte, Juan Carlos","Jopling, C; Sleep, E; Raya, M; Marti, M; Raya, A; Belmonte, JCI",606.0,"[Jopling, Chris; Sleep, Eduard; Raya, Marina; Marti, Merce; Raya, Angel; Izpisua Belmonte, Juan Carlos] Ctr Regenerat Med Barcelona, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Sleep, Eduard; Raya, Angel; Izpisua Belmonte, Juan Carlos] Networking Ctr Biomed Res Bioengn Biomat & Nanome, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Raya, Angel] ICREA, Barcelona 08010, Spain; [Izpisua Belmonte, Juan Carlos] Salk Inst Biol Studies, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08899,Article,,belmonte@salk.edu,U168,"Ministry of Innovation, Universities and Enterprise (DIUE), Generalitat de Catalunya; Fundacion Cellex; Ipsen Foundation; G.
