0,81,273.0,"Tuberculosis remains second only to HIV/AIDS as the leading cause of mortality worldwide due to a single infectious agent(1). Despite chemotherapy, the global tuberculosis epidemic has intensified because of HIV co-infection, the lack of an effective vaccine and the emergence of multi-drug-resistant bacteria(2-5). Alternative host-directed strategies could be exploited to improve treatment efficacy and outcome, contain drug-resistant strains and reduce disease severity and mortality(6). The innate inflammatory response elicited by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) represents a logical host target(7). Here we demonstrate that interleukin-1 (IL-1) confers host resistance through the induction of eicosanoids that limit excessive type I interferon (IFN) production and foster bacterial containment. We further show that, in infected mice and patients, reduced IL-1 responses and/or excessive type I IFN induction are linked to an eicosanoid imbalance associated with disease exacerbation. Host-directed immunotherapy with clinically approved drugs that augment prostaglandin E2 levels in these settings prevented acute mortality of Mtb-infected mice. Thus, IL-1 and type I IFNs represent two major counter-regulatory classes of inflammatory cytokines that control the outcome of Mtb infection and are functionally linked via eicosanoids. Our findings establish proof of concept for host-directed treatment strategies that manipulate the host eicosanoid network and represent feasible alternatives to conventional chemotherapy.","Mayer-Barber, Katrin D.; Andrade, Bruno B.; Oland, Sandra D.; Amaral, Eduardo P.; Barber, Daniel L.; Gonzales, Jacqueline; Derrick, Steven C.; Shi, Ruiru; Kumar, Nathella Pavan; Wei, Wang; Yuan, Xing; Zhang, Guolong; Cai, Ying; Babu, Subash; Catalfamo, Marta; Salazar, Andres M.; Via, Laura E.; Barry, Clifton E., III; Sher, Alan","Mayer-Barber, KD; Andrade, BB; Oland, SD; Amaral, EP; Barber, DL; Gonzales, J; Derrick, SC; Shi, RR; Kumar, NP; Wei, W; Yuan, X; Zhang, GL; Cai, Y; Babu, S; Catalfamo, M; Salazar, AM; Via, LE; Barry, CE; Sher, A",99.0,"[Mayer-Barber, Katrin D.; Andrade, Bruno B.; Oland, Sandra D.; Amaral, Eduardo P.; Sher, Alan] NIAID, Immunobiol Sect, LPD, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Amaral, Eduardo P.] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Biomed Sci, Dept Immunol, BR-05508900 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Barber, Daniel L.] NIAID, Lymphocyte Biol Unit T, LPD, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Gonzales, Jacqueline; Via, Laura E.; Barry, Clifton E., III] NIAID, TB Res Sect, Lab Clin Infect Dis, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Derrick, Steven C.] US FDA, Ctr Biol Evaluat & Res, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Shi, Ruiru; Wei, Wang; Yuan, Xing] Henan Chest Hosp, Zhengzhou 450003, Peoples R China; [Kumar, Nathella Pavan; Babu, Subash] Int Ctr Excellence Res, NIH, Madras 600031, Tamil Nadu, India; [Kumar, Nathella Pavan] NIRT, Madras 600031, Tamil Nadu, India; [Zhang, Guolong] SinoUS Int Res Ctr TB, Zhengzhou 450003, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Guolong] Henan Publ Hlth Ctr, Zhengzhou 450003, Peoples R China; [Babu, Subash] NIAID, Helminth Immunol Sect, LPD, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Catalfamo, Marta] NIAID, Clin & Mol Retrovirol Sect, Immunoregulat Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Salazar, Andres M.] Oncovir Inc, Washington, DC 20008 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13489,Article,1476-4687,mayerk@niaid.nih.gov,U491,"NIAID Intramural Research program; Concept Acceleration Program-Award from DMID, NIAID","This work was supported by the NIAID Intramural Research program and a Concept Acceleration Program-Award (K.D.M.-B., B.B.A. and A.S.) from DMID, NIAID.

1,111,290.0,"Adult neurogenesis arises from neural stem cells within specialized niches(1-3). Neuronal activity and experience, presumably acting on this local niche, regulate multiple stages of adult neurogenesis, from neural progenitor proliferation to new neuron maturation, synaptic integration and survival(1,3). It is unknown whether local neuronal circuitry has a direct impact on adult neural stem cells. Here we show that, in the adult mouse hippocampus, nestin-expressing radial glia-like quiescent neural stem cells(4-9) (RGLs) respond tonically to the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) by means of gamma(2)-subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors. Clonal analysis(9) of individual RGLs revealed a rapid exit from quiescence and enhanced symmetrical self-renewal after conditional deletion of gamma(2). RGLs are in close proximity to terminals expressing 67-kDa glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD67) of parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons and respond tonically to GABA released from these neurons. Functionally, optogenetic control of the activity of dentate PV+ interneurons, but not that of somatostatin-expressing or vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons, can dictate the RGL choice between quiescence and activation. Furthermore, PV+ interneuron activation restores RGL quiescence after social isolation, an experience that induces RGL activation and symmetrical division(8). Our study identifies a niche cell-signal-receptor trio and a local circuitry mechanism that control the activation and self-renewal mode of quiescent adult neural stem cells in response to neuronal activity and experience.","Song, Juan; Zhong, Chun; Bonaguidi, Michael A.; Sun, Gerald J.; Hsu, Derek; Gu, Yan; Meletis, Konstantinos; Huang, Z.

2,16,366.0,"A powerful way to discover key genes with causal roles in oncogenesis is to identify genomic regions that undergo frequent alteration in human cancers. Here we present high-resolution analyses of somatic copy-number alterations (SCNAs) from 3,131 cancer specimens, belonging largely to 26 histological types. We identify 158 regions of focal SCNA that are altered at significant frequency across several cancer types, of which 122 cannot be explained by the presence of a known cancer target gene located within these regions. Several gene families are enriched among these regions of focal SCNA, including the BCL2 family of apoptosis regulators and the NF-kappa B pathway. We show that cancer cells containing amplifications surrounding the MCL1 and BCL2L1 anti-apoptotic genes depend on the expression of these genes for survival. Finally, we demonstrate that a large majority of SCNAs identified in individual cancer types are present in several cancer types.","Beroukhim, Rameen; Mermel, Craig H.; Porter, Dale; Wei, Guo; Raychaudhuri, Soumya;

3,48,452.0,"Major ice sheets were permanently established on Antarctica approximately 34 million years ago(1-3), close to the Eocene/Oligocene boundary, at the same time as a permanent deepening of the calcite compensation depth in the world's oceans(4). Until recently, it was thought that Northern Hemisphere glaciation began much later, between 11 and 5 million years ago(1-3,5). This view has been challenged, however, by records of ice rafting at high northern latitudes during the Eocene epoch(6,7) and by estimates of global ice volume that exceed the storage capacity of Antarctica(8) at the same time as a temporary deepening of the calcite compensation depth 41.6 million years ago(9). Here we test the hypothesis that large ice sheets were present in both hemispheres 41.6 million years ago using marine sediment records of oxygen and carbon isotope values and of calcium carbonate content from the equatorial Atlantic Ocean. These records allow, at most, an ice budget that can easily be accommodated on Antarctica, indicating that large ice sheets were not present in the Northern Hemisphere. The records also reveal a brief interval shortly before the temporary deepening of the calcite compensation depth during which the calcite compensation depth shoaled, ocean temperatures increased and carbon isotope values decreased in the equatorial Atlantic. The nature of these changes around 41.6 million years ago implies common links, in terms of carbon cycling, with events at the Eocene/Oligocene boundary(4) and with the 'hyperthermals' of the Early Eocene climate optimum(3,10,11). Our findings help to resolve the apparent discrepancy between the geological records of Northern Hemisphere glaciation(6-8) and model results(12,13) that indicate that the threshold for continental glaciation was crossed earlier in the Southern Hemisphere than in the Northern Hemisphere.","Edgar, Kirsty M.; Wilson, Paul A.; Sexton, Philip F.; Suganuma, Yusuke","Edgar, KM; Wilson, PA; Sexton, PF; Suganuma, Y",908.0,"Natl Oceanog Ctr, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England; Univ Tokyo, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06053,Article,,paw1@noc.soton.ac.uk,911,,,202OM,,,ATMOSPHERIC CARBON-DIOXIDE; ICE-SHEET EXPANSION; ANTARCTIC GLACIATION; OLIGOCENE; OCEAN; PALEOCENE; GREENLAND; MAXIMUM; RECORDS,7156.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,"suganuma, yusuke/0000-0003-3516-1317; Edgar, Kirsty/0000-0001-7587-9951","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",23-Aug,4.0,LONDON,17713530.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007.0,"Sexton, Philip/B-2493-2010","Wilson, PA (reprint author), Natl Oceanog Ctr, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci, European Way, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,51.0,No extreme bipolar glaciation during the main Eocene calcite compensation shift,0.0,18.0,WOS:000248912900042,452.0,448.0,Multidisciplinary Sciences,52.0,yusuke,suganuma,563.0,28.0,male,1.0,Jaf7rrYAAAAJ,1.0,"[0, 1474]",53708210,1,14608977,1
4,63,324.0,"mu-Opioid receptors (mu ORs) are G-protein-coupled receptors that are activated by a structurally diverse spectrum of natural and synthetic agonists including endogenous endorphin peptides, morphine and methadone. The recent structures of the mu OR in inactive(1) and agonist-induced active states (Huang et al., ref. 2) provide snapshots of the receptor at the beginning and end of a signalling event, but little is known about the dynamic sequence of events that span these two states. Here we use solution-state NMR to examine the process of mu OR activation using a purified receptor (mouse sequence) preparation in an amphiphile membrane-like environment. We obtain spectra of the mu OR in the absence of ligand, and in the presence of the high-affinity agonist BU72 alone, or with BU72 and a G protein mimetic nanobody. Our results show that conformational changes in transmembrane segments 5 and 6 (TM5 and TM6), which are required for the full engagement of a G protein, are almost completely dependent on the presence of both the agonist and the G protein mimetic nanobody, revealing a weak allosteric coupling between the agonist-binding pocket and the G-protein-coupling interface (TM5 and TM6), similar to that observed for the beta 2-adrenergic receptor(3). Unexpectedly, in the presence of agonist alone, we find larger spectral changes involving intracellular loop 1 and helix 8 compared to changes in TM5 and TM6. These results suggest that one or both of these domains may play a role in the initial interaction with the G protein, and that TM5 and TM6 are only engaged later in the process of complex formation. The initial interactions between the G protein and intracellular loop 1 and/or helix 8 may be involved in G-protein coupling specificity, as has been suggested for other family A G-protein-coupled receptors.","Sounier, Remy; Mas, Camille; Steyaert, Jan; Laeremans, Toon; Manglik, Aashish; Huang, Weijiao; Kobilka, Brian K.; Demene, Helene; Granier, Sebastien","Sounier, R; Mas, C; Steyaert, J; Laeremans, T; Manglik, A; Huang, WJ; Kobilka, BK; Demene, H; Granier, S",375.0,"[Sounier, Remy; Mas, Camille; Granier, Sebastien] Univ Montpellier, Inst Genom Fonct, CNRS, INSERM,U1191,UMR 5203, F-34000 Montpellier, France; [Steyaert, Jan; Laeremans, Toon] Vrije Univ Brussel, Struct Biol Brussels, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Steyaert, Jan; Laeremans, Toon] VIB, Struct Biol Res Ctr, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Manglik, Aashish; Huang, Weijiao; Kobilka, Brian K.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Physiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Demene, Helene] Univ Montpellier, Ctr Biochim Struct, CNRS, INSERM 1054,UMR 5048, F-34090 Montpellier, France",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14680,Article,1476-4687,helene@cbs.cnrs.fr; sebastien.granier@igf.cnrs.fr,+,INSERM; CNRS; National Institutes of Health [NIDA-DA036246],We acknowledge support from INSERM (S.G.) and CNRS (H.D.) and from the National Institutes of Health Grant (NIDA-DA036246 to B.K.K. and S.G.).

5,69,473.0,"We generated genome-wide data from 69 Europeans who lived between 8,000-3,000 years ago by enriching ancient DNA libraries for a target set of almost 400,000 polymorphisms. Enrichment of these positions decreases the sequencing required for genome-wide ancient DNA analysis by a median of around 250-fold, allowing us to study an order of magnitude more individuals than previous studies(1-8) and to obtain new insights about the past. We show that the populations of Western and Far Eastern Europe followed opposite trajectories between 8,000-5,000 years ago. At the beginning of the Neolithic period in Europe, similar to 8,000-7,000 years ago, closely related groups of early farmers appeared in Germany, Hungary and Spain, different from indigenous hunter-gatherers, whereas Russia was inhabited by a distinctive population of hunter-gatherers with high affinity to a similar to 24,000-year-old Siberian(6). By similar to 6,000-5,000 years ago, farmers throughout much of Europe had more hunter-gatherer ancestry than their predecessors, but in Russia, the Yamnaya steppe herders of this time were descended not only from the preceding eastern European hunter-gatherers, but also from a population of Near Eastern ancestry. Western and Eastern Europe came into contact similar to 4,500 years ago, as the Late Neolithic Corded Ware people from Germany traced similar to 75% of their ancestry to the Yamnaya, documenting a massive migration into the heartland of Europe from its eastern periphery. This steppe ancestry persisted in all sampled central Europeans until at least similar to 3,000 years ago, and is ubiquitous in present-day Europeans. These results provide support for a steppe origin(9) of at least some of the Indo-European languages of Europe.","Haak, Wolfgang; Lazaridis, Iosif; Patterson, Nick; Rohland, Nadin; Mallick, Swapan; Llamas, Bastien; Brandt, Guido; Nordenfelt, Susanne; Harney, Eadaoin; Stewardson, Kristin; Fu, Qiaomei; Mittnik, Alissa; Banffy, Eszter; Economou, Christos; Francken, Michael; Friederich, Susanne; Pena, Rafael Garrido; Hallgren, Fredrik; Khartanovich, Valery; Khokhlov, Aleksandr; Kunst, Michael; Kuznetsov, Pavel; Meller, Harald; Mochalov, Oleg; Moiseyev, Vayacheslav; Nicklisch, Nicole; Pichler, Sandra L.; Risch, Roberto; Rojo Guerra, Manuel A.; Roth, Christina; Szecsenyi-Nagy, Anna; Wahl, Joachim; Meyer, Matthias; Krause, Johannes; Brown, Dorcas; Anthony, David; Cooper, Alan; Alt, Kurt Werner; Reich, David","Haak, W; Lazaridis, I; Patterson, N; Rohland, N; Mallick, S; Llamas, B; Brandt, G; Nordenfelt, S; Harney, E; Stewardson, K; Fu, QM; Mittnik, A; Banffy, E; Economou, C; Francken, M; Friederich, S; Pena, RG; Hallgren, F; Khartanovich, V; Khokhlov, A; Kunst, M; Kuznetsov, P; Meller, H; Mochalov, O; Moiseyev, V; Nicklisch, N; Pichler, SL; Risch, R; Guerra, MAR; Roth, C; Szecsenyi-Nagy, A; Wahl, J; Meyer, M; Krause, J; Brown, D; Anthony, D; Cooper, A; Alt, KW; Reich, D",207.0,"[Haak, Wolfgang; Llamas, Bastien; Cooper, Alan] Univ Adelaide, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Australian Ctr Ancient DNA, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Haak, Wolfgang; Llamas, Bastien; Cooper, Alan] Univ Adelaide, Inst Environm, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Lazaridis, Iosif; Rohland, Nadin; Mallick, Swapan; Nordenfelt, Susanne; Harney, Eadaoin; Stewardson, Kristin; Fu, Qiaomei; Reich, David] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Lazaridis, Iosif; Patterson, Nick; Rohland, Nadin; Mallick, Swapan; Nordenfelt, Susanne; Harney, Eadaoin; Stewardson, Kristin; Fu, Qiaomei; Reich, David] Broad Inst Harvard & MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Mallick, Swapan; Harney, Eadaoin; Stewardson, Kristin; Reich, David] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Brandt, Guido; Nicklisch, Nicole; Roth, Christina; Szecsenyi-Nagy, Anna; Alt, Kurt Werner] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Anthropol, D-55128 Mainz, Germany; [Fu, Qiaomei; Meyer, Matthias] Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Anthropol, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Fu, Qiaomei] Chinese Acad Sci, IVPP, Key Lab Vertebrate Evolut & Human Origins, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Mittnik, Alissa; Krause, Johannes] Univ Tubingen, Inst Archaeol Sci, D-72070 Tubingen, Germany; [Banffy, Eszter; Szecsenyi-Nagy, Anna] Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Archaeol, Res Ctr Humanities, H-1014 Budapest, Hungary; [Banffy, Eszter] RGK, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany; [Economou, Christos] Stockholm Univ, Archaeol Res Lab, S-11418 Stockholm, Sweden; [Francken, Michael; Krause, Johannes] Univ Tubingen, Senckenberg Ctr Human Evolut & Paleoenvironm, Dept Paleoanthropol, D-72070 Tubingen, Germany; [Francken, Michael; Krause, Johannes] Univ Tubingen, Senckenberg Ctr Human Evolut & Paleoenvironm, Dept Archaeogenet, D-72070 Tubingen, Germany; [Friederich, Susanne; Meller, Harald; Nicklisch, Nicole; Alt, Kurt Werner] Saxony Anhalt & State Museum Prehist, State Off Heritage Management & Archaeol, D-06114 Halle, Germany; [Pena, Rafael Garrido] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Fac Filosofia & Letras, Dept Prehist & Arqueol, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Hallgren, Fredrik] Cultural Heritage Fdn, S-72212 Vasteras, Sweden; [Khartanovich, Valery; Moiseyev, Vayacheslav] Peter Great Museum Anthropol & Ethnog Kunstkamera, St Petersburg 199034, Russia; [Khokhlov, Aleksandr; Kuznetsov, Pavel; Mochalov, Oleg] Volga State Acad Social Sci & Humanities, Samara 443099, Russia; [Kunst, Michael] Deutsch Archaeol Inst, Abt Madrid, E-28002 Madrid, Spain; [Nicklisch, Nicole; Alt, Kurt Werner] Danube Private Univ, A-3500 Krems, Austria; [Pichler, Sandra L.; Alt, Kurt Werner] Univ Basel, Inst Prehist & Archaeol Sci, CH-4003 Basel, Switzerland; [Risch, Roberto] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Prehist, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Rojo Guerra, Manuel A.] Univ Valladolid, Dept Prehist & Arqueol, E-47002 Valladolid, Spain; [Wahl, Joachim] State Off Cultural Heritage Management Baden Wurt, D-78467 Constance, Germany; [Krause, Johannes] Max Planck Inst Sci Human Hist, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Brown, Dorcas; Anthony, David] Hartwick Coll, Dept Anthropol, Oneonta, NY 13820 USA",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14317,Article,1476-4687,reich@genetics.med.harvard.edu,+,"Australian Research Council [DP130102158]; German Research Foundation [Al 287/7-1, 7-3, Al 287/10-1, Al 287/14-1, Me 3245/1-1, 1-3]; US National Science Foundation HOMINID grant [BCS-1032255]; US National Institutes of Health [GM100233]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute","We thank P.

6,29,380.0,"A basic requirement for quantum information processing systems is the ability to completely control the state of a single qubit(1-6). For qubits based on electron spin, a universal single- qubit gate is realized by a rotation of the spin by any angle about an arbitrary axis. Driven, coherent Rabi oscillations between two spin states can be used to demonstrate control of the rotation angle. Ramsey interference, produced by two coherent spin rotations separated by a variable time delay, demonstrates control over the axis of rotation. Full quantum control of an electron spin in a quantum dot has previously been demonstrated using resonant radio- frequency pulses that require many spin precession periods(7-10). However, optical manipulation of the spin allows quantum control on a picosecond or femtosecond timescale(11-18), permitting an arbitrary rotation to be completed within one spin precession period(6). Recent work in optical single-spin control has demonstrated the initialization of a spin state in a quantumdot(19-22), as well as the ultrafast manipulation of coherence in a largely unpolarized single- spin state(17). Here we demonstrate complete coherent control over an initialized electron spin state in a quantum dot using picosecond optical pulses. First we vary the intensity of a single optical pulse to observe over six Rabi oscillations between the two spin states; then we apply two sequential pulses to observe high- contrast Ramsey interference. Such a two- pulse sequence realizes an arbitrary single- qubit gate completed on a picosecond timescale. Along with the spin initialization and final projective measurement of the spin state, these results demonstrate a complete set of all- optical single- qubit operations.","Press, David; Ladd, Thaddeus D.; Zhang, Bingyang; Yamamoto, Yoshihisa","Press, D; Ladd, TD; Zhang, BY; Yamamoto, Y",218.0,"[Press, David; Ladd, Thaddeus D.; Zhang, Bingyang; Yamamoto, Yoshihisa] Stanford Univ, Edward L Ginzton Lab, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Ladd, Thaddeus D.; Yamamoto, Yoshihisa] Res Org Informat & Syst, Natl Inst Informat, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1018403, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07530,Article,,dlpress@stanford.edu,221,"JST/SORST; NICT; MEXT; MURI [(ARMY, DAAD 19-03-1-0199)]; Special Coordination Funds for Promoting Science and Technology","This work was supported by JST/SORST, NICT, MEXT, MURI (ARMY, DAAD 19-03-1-0199) and Special Coordination Funds for Promoting Science and Technology.

7,79,242.0,"Genome instability is central to ageing, cancer and other diseases. It is not only proteins involved in DNA replication or the DNA damage response (DDR) that are important for maintaining genome integrity: from yeast to higher eukaryotes, mutations in genes involved in pre-mRNA splicing and in the biogenesis and export of messenger ribonudeoprotein (mRNP) also induce DNA damage and genome instability. This instability is frequently mediated by R-loops formed by DNA-RNA hybrids and a displaced single-stranded DNA(1). Here we show that the human TREX-2 complex, which is involved in mRNP biogenesis and export, prevents genome instability as determined by the accumulation of gamma-H2AX (Ser-139 phosphorylated histone H2AX) and 53BP1 foci and single-cell electrophoresis in cells depleted of the TREX-2 subunits PCID2, GANP and DSSI. We show that the BRCA2 repair factor, which binds to DSS1, also associates with PCID2 in the cell. The use of an enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged hybrid-binding domain of RNase HI and the S9.6 antibody did not detect R-loops in TREX-2-depleted cells, but did detect the accumulation of R-loops in BRCA2-depleted cells. The results indicate that R-loops are frequently formed in cells and that BRCA2 is required for their processing. This link between BRCA2 and RNA-mediated genome instability indicates that R-loops may be a chief source of replication stress and cancer-associated instability.","Bhatia, Vaibhav; Barroso, Sonia I.; Garcia-Rubio, Maria L.; Tumini, Emanuela; Herrera-Moyano, Emilia; Aguilera, Andres","Bhatia, V; Barroso, SI; Garcia-Rubio, ML; Tumini, E; Herrera-Moyano, E; Aguilera, A",362.0,"[Bhatia, Vaibhav; Barroso, Sonia I.; Garcia-Rubio, Maria L.; Tumini, Emanuela; Herrera-Moyano, Emilia; Aguilera, Andres] Univ Seville, Ctr Andaluz Biol Mol & Med Regenerat CABIMER, Seville 41092, Spain",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13374,Article,1476-4687,aguilo@us.es,+,"Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [C5D2007-00015, BFU2010-16372]; Junta de Andalucia [CVI4567]; European Union (FEDER)","We thank J.C.

8,118,487.0,"Pathogenic bacteria using a type III secretion system (T3SS)(1,2) to manipulate host cells cause many different infections including Shigella dysentery, typhoid fever, enterohaemorrhagic colitis and bubonic plague. An essential part of the T3SS is a hollow needle-like protein filament through which effector proteins are injected into eukaryotic host cells(3-6). Currently, the three-dimensional structure of the needle is unknown because it is not amenable to X-ray crystallography and solution NMR, as a result of its inherent non-crystallinity and insolubility. Cryo-electron microscopy combined with crystal or solution NMR subunit structures has recently provided a powerful hybrid approach for studying supramolecular assemblies(7-12), resulting in low-resolution and medium-resolution models(13-17). However, such approaches cannot deliver atomic details, especially of the crucial subunit-subunit interfaces, because of the limited cryo-electron microscopic resolution obtained in these studies. Here we report an alternative approach combining recombinant wild-type needle production, solid-state NMR, electron microscopy and Rosetta modelling to reveal the supramolecular interfaces and ultimately the complete atomic structure of the Salmonella typhimurium T3SS needle. We show that the 80-residue subunits form a right-handed helical assembly with roughly 11 subunits per two turns, similar to that of the flagellar filament of S. typhimurium. In contrast to established models of the needle in which the amino terminus of the protein subunit was assumed to be alpha-helical and positioned inside the needle, our model reveals an extended amino-terminal domain that is positioned on the surface of the needle, while the highly conserved carboxy terminus points towards the lumen.","Loquet, Antoine; Sgourakis, Nikolaos G.; Gupta, Rashmi; Giller, Karin; Riedel, Dietmar; Goosmann, Christian; Griesinger, Christian; Kolbe, Michael; Baker, David; Becker, Stefan; Lange, Adam","Loquet, A; Sgourakis, NG; Gupta, R; Giller, K; Riedel, D; Goosmann, C; Griesinger, C; Kolbe, M; Baker, D; Becker, S; Lange, A",276.0,"[Loquet, Antoine; Giller, Karin; Griesinger, Christian; Becker, Stefan; Lange, Adam] Max Planck Inst Biophys Chem, Dept NMR Based Struct Biol, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Sgourakis, Nikolaos G.; Baker, David] Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Gupta, Rashmi; Kolbe, Michael] Max Planck Inst Infect Biol, Dept Cellular Microbiol, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Riedel, Dietmar] Max Planck Inst Biophys Chem, Lab Electron Microscopy, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Griesinger, Christian] Max Planck Inst Infect Biol, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11079,Article,1476-4687,kolbe@mpiib-berlin.mpg.de; sabe@nmr.mpibpc.mpg.de; adla@nmr.mpibpc.mpg.de,+,Max Planck Society; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Fondation Bettencourt Schueller; National Institutes of Health [1 R01 GM092802-01]; EMBO; European Union [261863],"We thank T.

9,30,392.0,"DNA sequence information underpins genetic research, enabling discoveries of important biological or medical benefit. Sequencing projects have traditionally used long ( 400 - 800 base pair) reads, but the existence of reference sequences for the human and many other genomes makes it possible to develop new, fast approaches to re- sequencing, whereby shorter reads are compared to a reference to identify intraspecies genetic variation. Here we report an approach that generates several billion bases of accurate nucleotide sequence per experiment at low cost. Single molecules of DNA are attached to a flat surface, amplified in situ and used as templates for synthetic sequencing with fluorescent reversible terminator deoxyribonucleotides. Images of the surface are analysed to generate high- quality sequence. We demonstrate application of this approach to human genome sequencing on flow- sorted X chromosomes and then scale the approach to determine the genome sequence of a male Yoruba from Ibadan, Nigeria. We build an accurate consensus sequence from. 303 average depth of paired 35- base reads. We characterize four million single- nucleotide polymorphisms and four hundred thousand structural variants, many of which were previously unknown. Our approach is effective for accurate, rapid and economical whole- genome re- sequencing and many other biomedical applications.","Bentley, David R.; Balasubramanian, Shankar; Swerdlow, Harold P.; Smith, Geoffrey P.; Milton, John; Brown, Clive G.; Hall, Kevin P.; Evers, Dirk J.; Barnes, Colin L.; Bignell, Helen R.; Boutell, Jonathan M.; Bryant, Jason; Carter, Richard J.; Cheetham, R.

10,26,281.0,"Telomeres cap the ends of chromosomes and provide a means to complete replication. The DNA portion of telomeres is synthesized by the enzyme telomerase using part of an RNA subunit as a template for reverse transcription. How the mature 39 end of telomerase RNA is generated has so far remained elusive. Here we show that in Schizosaccharomyces pombe telomerase RNA transcripts must be processed to generate functional telomerase. Characterization of the maturation pathway uncovered an unexpected role for the spliceosome, which normally catalyses splicing of pre- messenger RNA. The first spliceosomal cleavage reaction generates the mature 39 end of telomerase RNA ( TER1, the functional RNA encoded by the ter1(+) gene), releasing the active form of the RNA without exon ligation. Blocking the first step or permitting completion of splicing generates inactive forms of TER1 and causes progressive telomere shortening. We establish that 39 end processing of TER1 is critical for telomerase function and describe a previously unknown mechanism for RNA maturation that uses the ability of the spliceosome to mediate site- specific cleavage.","Box, Jessica A.; Bunch, Jeremy T.; Tang, Wen; Baumann, Peter","Box, JA; Bunch, JT; Tang, W; Baumann, P",910.0,"[Box, Jessica A.; Bunch, Jeremy T.; Tang, Wen; Baumann, Peter] Stowers Inst Med Res, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; [Tang, Wen; Baumann, Peter] Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Dept Mol & Integrat Physiol, Kansas City, KS 66160 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07584,Article,,peb@stowers-institute.org,U71,Stowers Institute for Medical Research; Pew Scholars; Biomedical Sciences Award,"The authors thank H.

11,22,199.0,"The largest extant snakes live in the tropics of South America and southeast Asia(1-3) where high temperatures facilitate the evolution of large body sizes among air- breathing animals whose body temperatures are dependant on ambient environmental temperatures ( poikilothermy)(4,5). Very little is known about ancient tropical terrestrial ecosystems, limiting our understanding of the evolution of giant snakes and their relationship to climate in the past. Here we describe a boid snake from the oldest known neotropical rainforest fauna from the Cerrejon Formation ( 58 - 60 Myr ago) in northeastern Colombia. We estimate a body length of 13 and a mass of 1,135 kg, making it the largest known snake(6-9). The maximum size of poikilothermic animals at a given temperature is limited by metabolic rate(4), and a snake of this size would require a minimum mean annual temperature of 30 - 34 degrees C to survive. This estimate is consistent with hypotheses of hot Palaeocene neotropics with high concentrations of atmospheric CO(2) based on climate models(10). Comparison of palaeotemperature estimates from the equator to those from South American mid- latitudes indicates a relatively steep temperature gradient during the early Palaeogene greenhouse, similar to that of today. Depositional environments and faunal composition of the Cerrejon Formation indicate an anaconda- like ecology for the giant snake, and an earliest Cenozoic origin of neotropical vertebrate faunas.","Head, Jason J.; Bloch, Jonathan I.; Hastings, Alexander K.; Bourque, Jason R.; Cadena, Edwin A.; Herrera, Fabiany A.; Polly, P.

12,40,318.0,"Targeted protein degradation is largely performed by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, in which substrate proteins are marked by covalently attached ubiquitin chains that mediate recognition by the proteasome. It is currently unclear how the proteasome recognizes its substrates, as the only established ubiquitin receptor intrinsic to the proteasome is Rpn10/S5a (ref. 1), which is not essential for ubiquitin- mediated protein degradation in budding yeast(2). In the accompanying manuscript we report that Rpn13 (refs 3-7), a component of the nine-subunit proteasome base, functions as a ubiquitin receptor(8), complementing its known role in docking de-ubiquitinating enzyme Uch37/UCHL5 (refs 4-6) to the proteasome. Here we merge crystallography and NMRdata to describe the ubiquitin-binding mechanism of Rpn13. We determine the structure of Rpn13 alone and complexed with ubiquitin. The co-complex reveals a novel ubiquitin-binding mode in which loops rather than secondary structural elements are used to capture ubiquitin. Further support for the role of Rpn13 as a proteasomal ubiquitin receptor is demonstrated by its ability to bind ubiquitin and proteasome subunit Rpn2/S1 simultaneously. Finally, we provide a model structure of Rpn13 complexed to diubiquitin, which provides insights into how Rpn13 as a ubiquitin receptor is coupled to substrate deubiquitination by Uch37.","Schreiner, Patrick; Chen, Xiang; Husnjak, Koraljka; Randles, Leah; Zhang, Naixia; Elsasser, Suzanne; Finley, Daniel; Dikic, Ivan; Walters, Kylie J.; Groll, Michael","Schreiner, P; Chen, X; Husnjak, K; Randles, L; Zhang, NX; Elsasser, S; Finley, D; Dikic, I; Walters, KJ; Groll, M",548.0,"[Schreiner, Patrick; Groll, Michael] Tech Univ Munich, Ctr Integrated Prot Sci, Dept Chem, Lehrstuhl Biochem, D-85747 Garching, Germany; [Chen, Xiang; Randles, Leah; Zhang, Naixia; Walters, Kylie J.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Biochem Mol Biol & Biophys, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Husnjak, Koraljka; Dikic, Ivan] Univ Frankfurt, Inst Biochem 2, D-60590 Frankfurt, Germany; [Husnjak, Koraljka; Dikic, Ivan] Mediterranean Inst Life Sci, Tumor Biol Program, Split 21000, Croatia; [Elsasser, Suzanne; Finley, Daniel] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Dikic, Ivan] Univ Split, Sch Med, Dept Immunol, Split 21000, Croatia; [Groll, Michael] Charite Univ Med Berlin CCM, Inst Biochem, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06924,Article,,ivan.dikic@biochem2.de; walte048@umn.edu; michael.groll@ch.tum.de,552,"NCI NIH HHS [CA097004, R01 CA097004, R01 CA097004-05, R01 CA097004-06A1]; NIGMS NIH HHS [GM43601, GM008700, R01 GM043601, R37 GM043601, R37 GM043601-17, T32 GM008700, T32 GM008700-09]",,303EL,,,DEUBIQUITINATING ENZYME; STRUCTURAL BASIS; MULTIUBIQUITIN CHAIN; PROTEIN INTERACTOME; EAP45-GLUE DOMAIN; RECOGNITION; DEGRADATION; COMPLEX; BINDING; SUBUNIT,7194.0,NATURE,Nature,English,28.0,No,"Dikic, Ivan/0000-0001-8156-9511; Husnjak, Koraljka/0000-0003-0573-6239","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",22-May,5.0,LONDON,18497827.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,"Groll, Michael/C-1174-2010; Chen, Xiang/E-2840-2010; Groll, Michael/F-5572-2015; Dikic, Ivan/O-4650-2015; Husnjak, Koraljka/C-3717-2015","Groll, M (reprint author), Tech Univ Munich, Ctr Integrated Prot Sci, Dept Chem, Lehrstuhl Biochem, Lichtenbergstr 4, D-85747 Garching, Germany.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,192.0,Ubiquitin docking at the proteasome through a novel pleckstrin-homology domain interaction,2.0,27.0,WOS:000256023700048,318.0,453.0,Multidisciplinary Sciences,198.0,michael,groll,80.0,11094.0,male,1.0,53LjSh4AAAAJ,1.0,"[0, 1474]",na,0,na,0
13,105,2.0,"The nucleus of the Milky Way is known to harbour regions of intense star formation activity as well as a supermassive black hole(1). Recent observations have revealed regions of gamma-ray emission reaching far above and below the Galactic Centre (relative to the Galactic plane), the so-called 'Fermi bubbles'(2). It is uncertain whether these were generated by nuclear star formation or by quasar-like outbursts of the central black hole(3-6) and no information on the structures' magnetic field has been reported. Here we report observations of two giant, linearly polarized radio lobes, containing three ridgelike substructures, emanating from the Galactic Centre. The lobes each extend about 60 degrees in the Galactic bulge, closely corresponding to the Fermi bubbles, and are permeated by strong magnetic fields of up to 15 microgauss. We conclude that the radio lobes originate in a biconical, star-formation-driven (rather than black-hole-driven) outflow from the Galaxy's central 200 parsecs that transports a huge amount of magnetic energy, about 10(55) ergs, into the Galactic halo. The ridges wind around this outflow and, we suggest, constitute a 'phonographic' record of nuclear star formation activity over at least ten million years.","Carretti, Ettore; Crocker, Roland M.; Staveley-Smith, Lister; Haverkorn, Marijke; Purcell, Cormac; Gaensler, B.

14,115,388.0,"Circulating tumour cells (CTCs) shed into blood from primary cancers include putative precursors that initiate distal metastases(1). Although these cells are extraordinarily rare, they may identify cellular pathways contributing to the blood-borne dissemination of cancer. Here, we adapted a microfluidic device(2) for efficient capture of CTCs from an endogenous mouse pancreatic cancer model(3) and subjected CTCs to single-molecule RNA sequencing(4), identifying Wnt2 as a candidate gene enriched in CTCs. Expression of WNT2 in pancreatic cancer cells suppresses anoikis, enhances anchorage-independent sphere formation, and increases metastatic propensity in vivo. This effect is correlated with fibronectin upregulation and suppressed by inhibition of MAP3K7 (also known as TAK1) kinase. In humans, formation of non-adherent tumour spheres by pancreatic cancer cells is associated with upregulation of multiple WNT genes, and pancreatic CTCs revealed enrichment for WNT signalling in 5 out of 11 cases. Thus, molecular analysis of CTCs may identify candidate therapeutic targets to prevent the distal spread of cancer.","Yu, Min; Ting, David T.; Stott, Shannon L.; Wittner, Ben S.; Ozsolak, Fatih; Paul, Suchismita; Ciciliano, Jordan C.; Smas, Malgorzata E.; Winokur, Daniel; Gilman, Anna J.; Ulman, Matthew J.; Xega, Kristina; Contino, Gianmarco; Alagesan, Brinda; Brannigan, Brian W.; Milos, Patrice M.; Ryan, David P.; Sequist, Lecia V.; Bardeesy, Nabeel; Ramaswamy, Sridhar; Toner, Mehmet; Maheswaran, Shyamala; Haber, Daniel A.","Yu, M; Ting, DT; Stott, SL; Wittner, BS; Ozsolak, F; Paul, S; Ciciliano, JC; Smas, ME; Winokur, D; Gilman, AJ; Ulman, MJ; Xega, K; Contino, G; Alagesan, B; Brannigan, BW; Milos, PM; Ryan, DP; Sequist, LV; Bardeesy, N; Ramaswamy, S; Toner, M; Maheswaran, S; Haber, DA",510.0,"[Yu, Min; Ting, David T.; Stott, Shannon L.; Wittner, Ben S.; Paul, Suchismita; Ciciliano, Jordan C.; Smas, Malgorzata E.; Winokur, Daniel; Gilman, Anna J.; Ulman, Matthew J.; Xega, Kristina; Contino, Gianmarco; Alagesan, Brinda; Brannigan, Brian W.; Ryan, David P.; Sequist, Lecia V.; Bardeesy, Nabeel; Ramaswamy, Sridhar; Toner, Mehmet; Maheswaran, Shyamala; Haber, Daniel A.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Canc, Ctr Engn Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Yu, Min; Ting, David T.; Stott, Shannon L.; Wittner, Ben S.; Paul, Suchismita; Ciciliano, Jordan C.; Smas, Malgorzata E.; Winokur, Daniel; Gilman, Anna J.; Ulman, Matthew J.; Xega, Kristina; Contino, Gianmarco; Alagesan, Brinda; Brannigan, Brian W.; Ryan, David P.; Sequist, Lecia V.; Bardeesy, Nabeel; Ramaswamy, Sridhar; Toner, Mehmet; Maheswaran, Shyamala; Haber, Daniel A.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Yu, Min; Ting, David T.; Stott, Shannon L.; Wittner, Ben S.; Paul, Suchismita; Ciciliano, Jordan C.; Smas, Malgorzata E.; Winokur, Daniel; Gilman, Anna J.; Ulman, Matthew J.; Xega, Kristina; Contino, Gianmarco; Alagesan, Brinda; Brannigan, Brian W.; Ryan, David P.; Sequist, Lecia V.; Bardeesy, Nabeel; Ramaswamy, Sridhar; Toner, Mehmet; Maheswaran, Shyamala; Haber, Daniel A.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Surg, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Yu, Min; Haber, Daniel A.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chevy Chase, MD 20815 USA; [Ozsolak, Fatih; Milos, Patrice M.] Helicos BioSci Corp, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11217,Article,,maheswaran@helix.mgh.harvard.edu; haber@helix.mgh.harvard.edu,U130,Stand Up To Cancer; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NIBIB [5R01EB008047]; NIH [CA129933]; Pancreatic Cancer Action Network - AACR Fellowship; Warshaw Institute for Pancreatic Cancer Research; K12 Paul Calabresi Award for Clinical Oncology Clinical Research Career Development Program NIH [5K12CA87723-09],"We thank C.

15,78,157.0,"During glacial periods of the Late Pleistocene, an abundance of proxy data demonstrates the existence of large and repeated millennial-scale warming episodes, known as Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events(1). This ubiquitous feature of rapid glacial climate change can be extended back as far as 800,000 years before present (BP) in the ice core record(2), and has drawn broad attention within the science and policy-making communities alike(3). Many studies have been dedicated to investigating the underlying causes of these changes, but no coherent mechanism has yet been identified(3-15). Here we show, by using a comprehensive fully coupled model(16), that gradual changes in the height of the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets (NHISs) canalter the coupled atmosphere ocean system and cause rapid glacial climate shifts closely resembling DO events. The simulated global climate responses-including abrupt warming in the North Atlantic, a northward shift of the tropical rain-belts, and Southern Hemisphere cooling related to the bipolar seesa ware generally consistent with empirical evidence(1,3,17). As a result of the coexistence of two glacial ocean circulation states at intermediate heights of the ice sheets, minor changes in the height of the NHISs and the amount of atmospheric CO2 can trigger the rapid climate transitions via a local positive atmosphere-ocean-sea-ice feedback in the North Atlantic. Our results, although based on a single model, thus provide a coherent concept for understanding the recorded millennial scale variability and abrupt climate changes in the coupled atmosphere ocean system, as well as their linkages to the volume of the intermediate ice sheets during glacials.","Zhang, Xu; Lohmann, Gerrit; Knorr, Gregor; Purcell, Conor","Zhang, X; Lohmann, G; Knorr, G; Purcell, C",290.0,"[Zhang, Xu; Lohmann, Gerrit; Knorr, Gregor; Purcell, Conor] Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Alfred Wegener Inst, D-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany; [Lohmann, Gerrit] Univ Bremen, MARUM Ctr Marine Environm Sci, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Knorr, Gregor; Purcell, Conor] Cardiff Univ, Sch Earth & Ocean Sci, Cardiff CF10 3AT, S Glam, Wales",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13592,Article,1476-4687,xu.zhang@awi.de,+,"Polar Regions and Coasts in the Changing Earth System (PACES) programme of the AWI; 'Helmholtz Climate Initiative REKLIM' (Regional Climate Change), a joint research project of the Helmholtz Association of German research centres (HGF)","We thank the colleagues in the Paleoclimate Dynamics group at the Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI) in Bremerhaven for useful discussions, and I.

16,119,34.0,"Opium is one of the world's oldest drugs, and its derivatives morphine and codeine are among the most used clinical drugs to relieve severe pain. These prototypical opioids produce analgesia as well as many undesirable side effects (sedation, apnoea and dependence) by binding to and activating the G-protein-coupled mu-opioid receptor (mu-OR) in the central nervous system. Here we describe the 2.8 angstrom crystal structure of the mouse mu-OR in complex with an irreversible morphinan antagonist. Compared to the buried binding pocket observed in most G-protein-coupled receptors published so far, the morphinan ligand binds deeply within a large solvent-exposed pocket. Of particular interest, the mu-OR crystallizes as a two-fold symmetrical dimer through a four-helix bundle motif formed by transmembrane segments 5 and 6. These high-resolution insights into opioid receptor structure will enable the application of structure-based approaches to develop better drugs for the management of pain and addiction.","Manglik, Aashish; Kruse, Andrew C.; Kobilka, Tong Sun; Thian, Foon Sun; Mathiesen, Jesper M.; Sunahara, Roger K.; Pardo, Leonardo; Weis, William I.; Kobilka, Brian K.; Granier, Sebastien","Manglik, A; Kruse, AC; Kobilka, TS; Thian, FS; Mathiesen, JM; Sunahara, RK; Pardo, L; Weis, WI; Kobilka, BK; Granier, S",321.0,"[Manglik, Aashish; Kruse, Andrew C.; Kobilka, Tong Sun; Thian, Foon Sun; Mathiesen, Jesper M.; Weis, William I.; Kobilka, Brian K.; Granier, Sebastien] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Physiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Sunahara, Roger K.] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Pardo, Leonardo] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Unit Bioestat, Lab Med Computac, Barcelona 08193, Spain; [Weis, William I.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Struct, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Granier, Sebastien] CNRS, INSERM, U661, UMR 5203, F-34094 Montpellier, France; [Granier, Sebastien] Univ Montpellier 1 & 2, Inst Genom Fonctionnelle, F-34094 Montpellier, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10954,Article,,kobilka@stanford.edu; granier@stanford.edu,U170,"INSERM; Stanford Medical Scientist Training Program; National Science Foundation; Lundbeck Foundation; National Institutes of Health [NS028471, DA031418]; Mathers Foundation","We acknowledge support from INSERM (S.

17,95,135.0,"Early-life dietary transitions reflect fundamental aspects of primate evolution and are important determinants of health in contemporary human populations(1,2). Weaning is critical to developmental and reproductive rates; early weaning can have detrimental health effects but enables shorter inter-birth intervals, which influences population growth(3). Uncovering early-life dietary history in fossils is hampered by the absence of prospectively validated biomarkers that are not modified during fossilization(4). Here we show that large dietary shifts in early life manifest as compositional variations in dental tissues. Teeth from human children and captive macaques, with prospectively recorded diet histories, demonstrate that barium (Ba) distributions accurately reflect dietary transitions from the introduction of mother's milk through the weaning process. We also document dietary transitions in a Middle Palaeolithic juvenile Neanderthal, which shows a pattern of exclusive breastfeeding for seven months, followed by seven months of supplementation. After this point, Ba levels in enamel returned to baseline prenatal levels, indicating an abrupt cessation of breastfeeding at 1.2 years of age. Integration of Ba spatial distributions and histological mapping of tooth formation enables novel studies of the evolution of human life history, dietary ontogeny in wild primates, and human health investigations through accurate reconstructions of breastfeeding history.","Austin, Christine; Smith, Tanya M.; Bradman, Asa; Hinde, Katie; Joannes-Boyau, Renaud; Bishop, David; Hare, Dominic J.; Doble, Philip; Eskenazi, Brenda; Arora, Manish","Austin, C; Smith, TM; Bradman, A; Hinde, K; Joannes-Boyau, R; Bishop, D; Hare, DJ; Doble, P; Eskenazi, B; Arora, M",216.0,"[Austin, Christine; Arora, Manish] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Prevent Med, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Austin, Christine; Arora, Manish] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Austin, Christine; Arora, Manish] Westmead Hosp, Westmead Millennium Inst, Inst Dent Res, Sydney, NSW 2145, Australia; [Austin, Christine; Arora, Manish] Univ Sydney, Fac Dent, Sydney, NSW 2145, Australia; [Smith, Tanya M.; Hinde, Katie] Harvard Univ, Dept Human Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Bradman, Asa; Eskenazi, Brenda] Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Publ Hlth, Ctr Environm Res & Childrens Hlth, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Hinde, Katie] Calif Natl Primate Res Ctr, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Joannes-Boyau, Renaud] So Cross Univ, Lismore, NSW 2480, Australia; [Bishop, David; Hare, Dominic J.; Doble, Philip] Univ Technol Sydney, Elemental Bioimaging Facil, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Hare, Dominic J.] Univ Melbourne, Florey Inst Neurosci & Mental Hlth, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12169,Article,,marora@hsph.harvard.edu,+,"US Environmental Protection Agency [RD 83171001, RD 82670901]; US National Institutes of Environmental Health Sciences [PO1 ES009605]; NSF [BCS-0921978]; Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology; Australian Research Council [DP120101752, LP100200254]; SCU postdoctoral Fellowship grant; National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences [4R00ES019597-03]; NHMRC [APP1028372]; Agilent Technologies; Kennelec Scientific","L.

18,122,182.0,"Neuroectodermal signalling centres induce and pattern many novel vertebrate brain structures but are absent, or divergent, in invertebrate chordates. This has led to the idea that signalling-centre genetic programs were first assembled in stem vertebrates and potentially drove morphological innovations of the brain. However, this scenario presumes that extant cephalochordates accurately represent ancestral chordate characters, which has not been tested using close chordate outgroups. Here we report that genetic programs homologous to three vertebrate signalling centres-the anterior neural ridge, zona limitans intrathalamica and isthmic organizer-are present in the hemichordate Saccoglossus kowalevskii. Fgf8/17/18 (a single gene homologous to vertebrate Fgf8, Fgf17 and Fgf18), sfrp1/5, hh and wnt1 are expressed in vertebrate-like arrangements in hemichordate ectoderm, and homologous genetic mechanisms regulate ectodermal patterning in both animals. We propose that these genetic programs were components of an unexpectedly complex, ancient genetic regulatory scaffold for deuterostome body patterning that degenerated in amphioxus and ascidians, but was retained to pattern divergent structures in hemichordates and vertebrates.","Pani, Ariel M.; Mullarkey, Erin E.; Aronowicz, Jochanan; Assimacopoulos, Stavroula; Grove, Elizabeth A.; Lowe, Christopher J.","Pani, AM; Mullarkey, EE; Aronowicz, J; Assimacopoulos, S; Grove, EA; Lowe, CJ",289.0,"[Pani, Ariel M.; Lowe, Christopher J.] Univ Chicago, Comm Evolut Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Pani, Ariel M.; Lowe, Christopher J.] Stanford Univ, Hopkins Marine Stn, Dept Biol, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA; [Mullarkey, Erin E.; Grove, Elizabeth A.] Univ Chicago, Comm Neurobiol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Aronowicz, Jochanan; Grove, Elizabeth A.; Lowe, Christopher J.] Univ Chicago, Dept Organismal Biol & Anat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Assimacopoulos, Stavroula; Grove, Elizabeth A.] Univ Chicago, Dept Neurobiol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10838,Article,,clowe@stanford.edu,U79,Searle Kinship Foundation; Brain Research Foundation; National Science Foundation [1049106]; National Institutes of Health [R01 HD42330]; University of Chicago; Marine Biological Laboratory Frank R.

19,39,316.0,"RNA interference (RNAi) is a mechanism by which doublestranded RNAs (dsRNAs) suppress specific transcripts in a sequence-dependent manner. dsRNAs are processed by Dicer to 21-24-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and then incorporated into the argonaute (Ago) proteins(1-4). Gene regulation by endogenous siRNAs has been observed only in organisms possessing RNA- dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP)(5-10). In mammals, where no RdRP activity has been found, biogenesis and function of endogenous siRNAs remain largely unknown. Here we show, using mouse oocytes, that endogenous siRNAs are derived from naturally occurring dsRNAs and have roles in the regulation of gene expression. By means of deep sequencing, we identify a large number of both similar to 25-27-nucleotide Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) and similar to 21-nucleotide siRNAs corresponding to messenger RNAs or retrotransposons in growing oocytes. piRNAs are bound to Mili and have a role in the regulation of retrotransposons. siRNAs are exclusively mapped to retrotransposons or other genomic regions that produce transcripts capable of forming dsRNA structures. Inverted repeat structures, bidirectional transcription and antisense transcripts from various loci are sources of the dsRNAs. Some precursor transcripts of siRNAs are derived from expressed pseudogenes, indicating that one role of pseudogenes is to adjust the level of the founding source mRNA through RNAi. Loss of Dicer or Ago2 results in decreased levels of siRNAs and increased levels of retrotransposon and protein-coding transcripts complementary to the siRNAs. Thus, the RNAi pathway regulates both protein-coding transcripts and retrotransposons in mouse oocytes. Our results reveal a role for endogenous siRNAs in mammalian oocytes and show that organisms lacking RdRP activity can produce functional endogenous siRNAs from naturally occurring dsRNAs.","Watanabe, Toshiaki; Totoki, Yasushi; Toyoda, Atsushi; Kaneda, Masahiro; Kuramochi-Miyagawa, Satomi; Obata, Yayoi; Chiba, Hatsune; Kohara, Yuji; Kono, Tomohiro; Nakano, Toru; Surani, M.

20,109,258.0,"Epigenetic information is frequently erased near the start of each new generation(1). In some cases, however, epigenetic information can be transmitted from parent to progeny (multigenerational epigenetic inheritance)(2). A particularly notable example of this type of epigenetic inheritance is double-stranded RNA-mediated gene silencing in Caenorhabditis elegans. This RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) can be inherited for more than five generations(3-8). To understand this process, here we conduct a genetic screen for nematodes defective in transmitting RNAi silencing signals to future generations. This screen identified the heritable RNAi defective 1 (hrde-1) gene. hrde-1 encodes an Argonaute protein that associates with small interfering RNAs in the germ cells of progeny of animals exposed to double-stranded RNA. In the nuclei of these germ cells, HRDE-1 engages the nuclear RNAi defective pathway to direct the trimethylation of histone H3 at Lys 9 (H3K9me3) at RNAi-targeted genomic loci and promote RNAi inheritance. Under normal growth conditions, HRDE-1 associates with endogenously expressed short interfering RNAs, which direct nuclear gene silencing in germ cells. In hrde-1- or nuclear RNAi-deficient animals, germline silencing is lost over generational time. Concurrently, these animals exhibit steadily worsening defects in gamete formation and function that ultimately lead to sterility. These results establish that the Argonaute protein HRDE-1 directs gene-silencing events in germ-cell nuclei that drive multigenerational RNAi inheritance and promote immortality of the germ-cell lineage. We propose that C. elegans use the RNAi inheritance machinery to transmit epigenetic information, accrued by past generations, into future generations to regulate important biological processes.","Buckley, Bethany A.; Burkhart, Kirk B.; Gu, Sam Guoping; Spracklin, George; Kershner, Aaron; Fritz, Heidi; Kimble, Judith; Fire, Andrew; Kennedy, Scott","Buckley, BA; Burkhart, KB; Gu, SG; Spracklin, G; Kershner, A; Fritz, H; Kimble, J; Fire, A; Kennedy, S",447.0,"[Buckley, Bethany A.; Burkhart, Kirk B.; Spracklin, George; Fritz, Heidi; Kimble, Judith; Kennedy, Scott] Univ Wisconsin, Lab Genet, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Gu, Sam Guoping; Fire, Andrew] Stanford Univ, Dept Pathol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Gu, Sam Guoping; Fire, Andrew] Stanford Univ, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kershner, Aaron; Fritz, Heidi] Univ Wisconsin, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Kershner, Aaron; Kimble, Judith] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biochem, Madison, WI 53706 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11352,Article,,sgkennedy@wisc.edu,451,"Pew scholar's program; Shaw scholar's program; National Institutes of Health [GM88289, GM37706, GM069454]","We thank P.

21,131,212.0,"The location and timing of cellular differentiation must be stringently controlled for proper organ formation. Normally, hepatocytes differentiate from hepatic progenitor cells to form the liver during development(1,2). However, previous studies have shown that the hepatic program can also be activated in non-hepatic lineage cells after exposure to particular stimuli or fusion with hepatocytes(3-9). These unexpected findings suggest that factors critical to hepatocyte differentiation exist and become activated to induce hepatocyte-specific properties in different cell types. Here, by screening the effects of twelve candidate factors, we identify three specific combinations of two transcription factors, comprising Hnf4 alpha plus Foxa1, Foxa2 or Foxa3, that can convert mouse embryonic and adult fibroblasts into cells that closely resemble hepatocytes in vitro. The induced hepatocyte-like (iHep) cells have multiple hepatocyte-specific features and reconstitute damaged hepatic tissues after transplantation. The generation of iHep cells may provide insights into the molecular nature of hepatocyte differentiation and potential therapies for liver diseases.","Sekiya, Sayaka; Suzuki, Atsushi","Sekiya, S; Suzuki, A",390.0,"[Sekiya, Sayaka; Suzuki, Atsushi] Kyushu Univ, Div Organogenesis & Regenerat, Med Inst Bioregulat, Higashi Ku, Fukuoka 8128582, Japan; [Suzuki, Atsushi] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, Precursory Res Embryon Sci & Technol PRESTO, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10263,Article,,suzukicks@bioreg.kyushu-u.ac.jp,U148,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan; Japan Science and Technology Agency","We thank A.

22,61,291.0,"Methane-oxidizing bacteria (methanotrophs) require large quantities of copper for the membrane-bound (particulate) methane monooxygenase(1,2). Certain methanotrophs are also able to switch to using the iron-containing soluble methane monooxygenase to catalyse methane oxidation, with this switchover regulated by copper(3,4). Methane monooxygenases are nature's primary biological mechanism for suppressing atmospheric levels of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Furthermore, methanotrophs and methane monooxygenases have enormous potential in bioremediation and for biotransformations producing bulk and fine chemicals, and in bioenergy, particularly considering increased methane availability from renewable sources and hydraulic fracturing of shale rock(5,6). Here we discover and characterize a novel copper storage protein (Csp1) from the methanotroph Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b that is exported from the cytosol, and stores copper for particulate methane monooxygenase. Csp1 is a tetramer of four-helix bundles with each monomer binding up to 13 Cu(I) ions in a previously unseen manner via mainly Cys residues that point into the core of the bundle. Csp1 is the first example of a protein that stores a metal within an established protein-folding motif. This work provides a detailed insight into how methanotrophs accumulate copper for the oxidation of methane. Understanding this process is essential if the wide-ranging biotechnological applications of methanotrophs are to be realized. Cytosolic homologues of Csp1 are present in diverse bacteria, thus challenging the dogma that such organisms do not use copper in this location.","Vita, Nicolas; Platsaki, Semeli; Basle, Arnaud; Allen, Stephen J.; Paterson, Neil G.; Crombie, Andrew T.; Murrell, J.

23,67,405.0,"Retroviral integration is catalysed by a tetramer of integrase (IN) assembled on viral DNA ends in a stable complex, known as the intasome(1,2). How the intasome interfaces with chromosomal DNA, which exists in the form of nucleosomal arrays, is currently unknown. Here we show that the prototype foamy virus (PFV) intasome is proficient at stable capture of nucleosomes as targets for integration. Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy reveals a multivalent intasome-nucleosome interface involving both gyres of nucleosomal DNA and one H2A-H2B heterodimer. While the histone octamer remains intact, the DNA is lifted from the surface of the H2A-H2B heterodimer to allow integration at strongly preferred superhelix location +/- 3.5 positions. Amino acid substitutions disrupting these contacts impinge on the ability of the intasome to engage nucleosomes in vitro and redistribute viral integration sites on the genomic scale. Our findings elucidate the molecular basis for nucleosome capture by the viral DNA recombination machinery and the underlying nucleosome plasticity that allows integration.","Maskell, Daniel P.; Renault, Ludovic; Serrao, Erik; Lesbats, Paul; Matadeen, Rishi; Hare, Stephen; Lindemann, Dirk; Engelman, Alan N.; Costa, Alessandro; Cherepanov, Peter","Maskell, DP; Renault, L; Serrao, E; Lesbats, P; Matadeen, R; Hare, S; Lindemann, D; Engelman, AN; Costa, A; Cherepanov, P",366.0,"[Maskell, Daniel P.; Lesbats, Paul; Cherepanov, Peter] Francis Crick Inst, Chromatin Struct & Mobile DNA, S Mimms EN6 3LD, Herts, England; [Renault, Ludovic; Costa, Alessandro] Francis Crick Inst, Clare Hall Labs, Architecture & Dynam Macromol Machines, S Mimms EN6 3LD, Herts, England; [Renault, Ludovic] Natl Inst Biol Stand & Control Microscopy & Imagi, S Mimms EN6 3QG, Herts, England; [Serrao, Erik; Engelman, Alan N.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Immunol & AIDS, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Matadeen, Rishi] Gorlaeus Lab, NeCEN, NL-2333 Leiden, Netherlands; [Hare, Stephen; Cherepanov, Peter] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Div Med, London W2 1PG, England; [Lindemann, Dirk] Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Virol, D-01307 Dresden, Germany",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14495,Article,1476-4687,alessandro.costa@crick.ac.uk; peter.cherepanov@crick.ac.uk,+,European Union [305137]; US National Institute of General Medical Sciences [GM082251-06]; US National Institutes of Health [AI070042-08]; Netherlands Centre for Electron Nanoscopy (NeCEN); Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek [175.010.2009.001]; European Union's Regional Development Fund through 'Kansen voor West' [21Z.014],"This work was supported by the European Union FP7 HIVINNOV consortium grant 305137 (to P.C.), the US National Institute of General Medical Sciences P50 grant GM082251-06 (to P.C.) and the US National Institutes of Health R01 grant AI070042-08 (to A.N.E.).

We propose a model whereby multiple infections(2,3) per cell lead to reduced sensitivity to drugs without requiring drug-resistant mutations, and experimentally validate the model using multiple infections per cell by cell-free HIV in the presence of the drug tenofovir. We then examine the drug sensitivity of cell-to-cell spread of HIV(4-7), a mode of HIV transmission that can lead to multiple infection events per target cell(8-10). Infections originating from cell-free virus decrease strongly in the presence of antiretrovirals tenofovir and efavirenz whereas infections involving cell-to-cell spread are markedly less sensitive to the drugs. The reduction in sensitivity is sufficient to keep multiple rounds of infection from terminating in the presence of drugs. We examine replication from cell-to-cell spread in the presence of clinical drug concentrations using a stochastic infection model and find that replication is intermittent, without substantial accumulation of mutations. If cell-to-cell spread has the same properties in vivo, it may have adverse consequences for the immune system(11-13), lead to therapy failure in individuals with risk factors(14), and potentially contribute to viral persistence and hence be a barrier to curing HIV infection.","Sigal, Alex; Kim, Jocelyn T.; Balazs, Alejandro B.; Dekel, Erez; Mayo, Avi; Milo, Ron; Baltimore, David","Sigal, A; Kim, JT; Balazs, AB; Dekel, E; Mayo, A; Milo, R; Baltimore, D",95.0,"[Sigal, Alex; Kim, Jocelyn T.; Balazs, Alejandro B.; Baltimore, David] CALTECH, Div Biol, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Kim, Jocelyn T.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Infect Dis, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Dekel, Erez; Mayo, Avi] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Mol Cell Biol, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Milo, Ron] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Plant Sci, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10347,Article,,baltimo@caltech.edu,U100,Human Frontier Science Program [LT00946]; UCLA [T32 AI089398]; amfAR Postdoctoral Research Fellowship [107756-47-RFVA]; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; National Institutes of Health [HHSN266200500035C]; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; UCLA CFAR Virology Core Lab [P01-AI-28697]; UCSF-GIVI CFAR [P30-AI-27763],"We thank B.

25,64,333.0,"Flat-slab subduction occurs when the descending plate becomes horizontal at some depth before resuming its descent into the mantle. It is often proposed as a mechanism for the uplifting of deep crustal rocks ('thick-skinned' deformation) far from plate boundaries, and for causing unusual patterns of volcanism, as far back as the Proterozoic eon(1). For example, the formation of the expansive Rocky Mountains and the subsequent voluminous volcanism across much of the western USA has been attributed to a broad region of flat-slab subduction beneath North America that occurred during the Laramide orogeny (80-55 million years ago)(2). Here we study the largest modern flat slab, located in Peru, to better understand the processes controlling the formation and extent of flat slabs. We present new data that indicate that the subducting Nazca Ridge is necessary for the development and continued support of the horizontal plate at a depth of about 90 kilometres. By combining constraints from Rayleigh wave phase velocities with improved earthquake locations, we find that the flat slab is shallowest along the ridge, while to the northwest of the ridge, the slab is sagging, tearing, and re-initiating normal subduction. On the basis of our observations, we propose a conceptual model for the temporal evolution of the Peruvian flat slab in which the flat slab forms because of the combined effects of trench retreat along the Peruvian plate boundary, suction, and ridge subduction. We find that while the ridge is necessary but not sufficient for the formation of the flat slab, its removal is sufficient for the flat slab to fail. This provides new constraints on our understanding of the processes controlling the beginning and end of the Laramide orogeny and other putative episodes of flat-slab subduction.","Antonijevic, Sanja Knezevic; Wagner, Lara S.; Kumar, Abhash; Beck, Susan L.; Long, Maureen D.; Zandt, George; Tavera, Hernando; Condori, Cristobal","Antonijevic, SK; Wagner, LS; Kumar, A; Beck, SL; Long, MD; Zandt, G; Tavera, H; Condori, C",212.0,"[Antonijevic, Sanja Knezevic; Kumar, Abhash] Univ N Carolina, Dept Geol Sci, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Wagner, Lara S.] Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Terr Magnetism, Washington, DC 20015 USA; [Beck, Susan L.; Zandt, George] Univ Arizona, Dept Geosci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Long, Maureen D.] Yale Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Tavera, Hernando; Condori, Cristobal] Inst Geofis Peru, Lima 15012, Peru",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14648,Article,1476-4687,sknezevi@live.unc.edu,+,"NSF [EAR-0944184, EAR-0943991, EAR-0943962, EAR-0908777, EAR-0907880]","We thank R.

Here we describe a comprehensive evaluation of the genomic landscape of 452 CLL cases and 54 patients with monoclonal B-lymphocytosis, a precursor disorder. We extend the number of CLL driver alterations, including changes in ZNF292, ZMYM3, ARID1A and PTPN11. We also identify novel recurrent mutations in non-coding regions, including the 39 region of NOTCH1, which cause aberrant splicing events, increase NOTCH1 activity and result in a more aggressive disease. In addition, mutations in an enhancer located on chromosome 9p13 result in reduced expression of the B-cell-specific transcription factor PAX5. The accumulative number of driver alterations (0 to >= 4) discriminated between patients with differences in clinical behaviour. This study provides an integrated portrait of the CLL genomic landscape, identifies new recurrent driver mutations of the disease, and suggests clinical interventions that may improve the management of this neoplasia.","Puente, Xose S.; Bea, Silvia; Valdes-Mas, Rafael; Villamor, Neus; Gutierrez-Abril, Jesus; Martin-Subero, Jose I.; Munar, Marta; Rubio-Perez, Carlota; Jares, Pedro; Aymerich, Marta; Baumann, Tycho; Beekman, Renee; Belver, Laura; Carrio, Anna; Castellano, Giancarlo; Clot, Guillem; Colado, Enrique; Colomer, Dolors; Costa, Dolors; Delgado, Julio; Enjuanes, Anna; Estivill, Xavier; Ferrando, Adolfo A.; Gelpi, Josep L.; Gonzalez, Blanca; Gonzalez, Santiago; Gonzalez, Marcos; Gut, Marta; Hernandez-Rivas, Jesus M.; Lopez-Guerra, Monica; Martin-Garcia, David; Navarro, Alba; Nicolas, Pilar; Orozco, Modesto; Payer, Angel R.; Pinyol, Magda; Pisano, David G.; Puente, Diana A.; Queiros, Ana C.; Quesada, Victor; Romeo-Casabona, Carlos M.; Royo, Cristina; Royo, Romina; Rozman, Maria; Russinol, Nuria; Salaverria, Itziar; Stamatopoulos, Kostas; Stunnenberg, Hendrik G.; Tamborero, David; Terol, Maria J.; Valencia, Alfonso; Lopez-Bigas, Nuria; Torrents, David; Gut, Ivo; Lopez-Guillermo, Armando; Lopez-Otin, Carlos; Campo, Elias","Puente, XS; Bea, S; Valdes-Mas, R; Villamor, N; Gutierrez-Abril, J; Martin-Subero, JI; Munar, M; Rubio-Perez, C; Jares, P; Aymerich, M; Baumann, T; Beekman, R; Belver, L; Carrio, A; Castellano, G; Clot, G; Colado, E; Colomer, D; Costa, D; Delgado, J; Enjuanes, A; Estivill, X; Ferrando, AA; Gelpi, JL; Gonzalez, B; Gonzalez, S; Gonzalez, M; Gut, M; Hernandez-Rivas, JM; Lopez-Guerra, M; Martin-Garcia, D; Navarro, A; Nicolas, P; Orozco, M; Payer, AR; Pinyol, M; Pisano, DG; Puente, DA; Queiros, AC; Quesada, V; Romeo-Casabona, CM; Royo, C; Royo, R; Rozman, M; Russinol, N; Salaverria, I; Stamatopoulos, K; Stunnenberg, HG; Tamborero, D; Terol, MJ; Valencia, A; Lopez-Bigas, N; Torrents, D; Gut, I; Lopez-Guillermo, A; Lopez-Otin, C; Campo, E",519.0,"[Puente, Xose S.; Valdes-Mas, Rafael; Gutierrez-Abril, Jesus; Puente, Diana A.; Quesada, Victor; Lopez-Otin, Carlos] Univ Oviedo, Inst Univ Oncol IUOPA, Dept Bioquim & Biol Mol, E-33006 Oviedo, Spain; [Bea, Silvia; Beekman, Renee; Castellano, Giancarlo; Clot, Guillem; Martin-Garcia, David; Navarro, Alba; Royo, Cristina; Russinol, Nuria; Salaverria, Itziar] IDIBAPS, Barcelona 08036, Spain; [Villamor, Neus; Aymerich, Marta; Carrio, Anna; Colomer, Dolors; Costa, Dolors; Gonzalez, Blanca; Lopez-Guerra, Monica; Rozman, Maria; Campo, Elias] Univ Barcelona, IDIBAPS, Hosp Clin, Unitat Hematol, E-08036 Barcelona, Spain; [Martin-Subero, Jose I.; Queiros, Ana C.] Univ Barcelona, Dept Anat Patol Microbiol & Farmacol, E-08036 Barcelona, Spain; [Munar, Marta; Gelpi, Josep L.; Gonzalez, Santiago; Orozco, Modesto; Royo, Romina; Torrents, David] Univ Barcelona, Spanish Natl Bioinformat Inst, Programa Conjunto Biol Computac, BSC,IRB, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; [Rubio-Perez, Carlota; Tamborero, David; Lopez-Bigas, Nuria] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Expt & Hlth Sci, Res Unit Biomed Informat, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Jares, Pedro; Enjuanes, Anna; Pinyol, Magda] IDIBAPS, Unidad Genom, Barcelona 08036, Spain; [Baumann, Tycho; Delgado, Julio; Lopez-Guillermo, Armando] IDIBAPS, Hosp Clin, Serv Hematol, Barcelona 08036, Spain; [Belver, Laura; Ferrando, Adolfo A.] Columbia Univ, Inst Canc Genet, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Colado, Enrique; Payer, Angel R.] Hosp Univ Cent Asturias, Serv Hematol, Oviedo 33011, Spain; [Estivill, Xavier] Pompeu Fabra Univ, Hosp Mar Res Inst IMIM, CRG, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Gonzalez, Marcos; Hernandez-Rivas, Jesus M.] Univ Salamanca, Hosp Univ Salamanca, Ctr Invest Canc, Serv Hematol,IBSAL,CSIC, Salamanca 37007, Spain; [Gut, Marta; Gut, Ivo] Ctr Nacl Anal Genom, Barcelona 08028, Spain; [Nicolas, Pilar; Romeo-Casabona, Carlos M.] Univ Basque Country, Univ Deusto, Catedra Interuniv Derecho & Genoma Humano, Bilbao 48007, Spain; [Pisano, David G.; Valencia, Alfonso] Spanish Natl Bioinformat Inst, Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, Struct Biol & Biocomp Programme, Madrid 28029, Spain; [Stamatopoulos, Kostas] Ctr Res & Technol Hellas, Inst Appl Biosci, Thessaloniki 57001, Greece; [Stunnenberg, Hendrik G.] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Nijmegen Ctr Mol Life Sci, Fac Sci, Dept Mol Biol, NL-6500 HB Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Terol, Maria J.] Hosp Clin Valencia, Serv Hematol, Valencia 46010, Spain",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14666,Article,1476-4687,clo@uniovi.es; ecampo@clinic.ub.es,U115,Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through the Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII); Red Tematica de Investigacion del Cancer (RTICC); Banco Santander through its Santander Universities Global Division,"This work was funded by Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through the Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII) and Red Tematica de Investigacion del Cancer (RTICC).

27,125,345.0,"Despite tremendous efforts, development of an effective vaccine against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has proved an elusive goal. Recently, however, numerous antibodies have been identified that are capable of neutralizing most circulating HIV strains(1-5). These antibodies all exhibit an unusually high level of somatic mutation(6), presumably owing to extensive affinity maturation over the course of continuous exposure to an evolving antigen(7). Although substantial effort has focused on the design of immunogens capable of eliciting antibodies de novo that would target similar epitopes(8-10), it remains uncertain whether a conventional vaccine will be able to elicit analogues of the existing broadly neutralizing antibodies. As an alternative to immunization, vector-mediated gene transfer could be used to engineer secretion of the existing broadly neutralizing antibodies into the circulation. Here we describe a practical implementation of this approach, which we call vectored immunoprophylaxis (VIP), which in mice induces lifelong expression of these monoclonal antibodies at high concentrations from a single intramuscular injection. This is achieved using a specialized adeno-associated virus vector optimized for the production of full-length antibody from muscle tissue. We show that humanized mice receiving VIP appear to be fully protected from HIV infection, even when challenged intravenously with very high doses of replication-competent virus. Our results suggest that successful translation of this approach to humans may produce effective prophylaxis against HIV.","Balazs, Alejandro B.; Chen, Joyce; Hong, Christin M.; Rao, Dinesh S.; Yang, Lili; Baltimore, David","Balazs, AB; Chen, J; Hong, CM; Rao, DS; Yang, LL; Baltimore, D",81.0,"[Balazs, Alejandro B.; Chen, Joyce; Hong, Christin M.; Yang, Lili; Baltimore, David] CALTECH, Div Biol, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Rao, Dinesh S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10660,Article,,baltimo@caltech.edu,U88,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation through Grand Challenges in Global Health Initiative [37866]; National Institutes of Health through the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) [HHSN266200500035C]; Joint Center for Translational Medicine; amfAR [107756-47-RFVA]; National Institutes of Health [1K08CA133521],"We thank J.

29,74,94.0,"Stresses acting on cold, thick and negatively buoyant oceanic lithosphere are thought to be crucial to the initiation of subduction and the operation of plate tectonics(1,2), which characterizes the present-day geodynamics of the Earth. Because the Earth's interior was hotter in the Archaean eon, the oceanic crust may have been thicker, thereby making the oceanic lithosphere more buoyant than at present(3), and whether subduction and plate tectonics occurred during this time is ambiguous, both in the geological record and in geodynamic models(4). Here we show that because the oceanic crust was thick and buoyant(5), early continents may have produced intra-lithospheric gravitational stresses large enough to drive their gravitational spreading, to initiate subduction at their margins and to trigger episodes of subduction. Our model predicts the co-occurrence of deep to progressively shallower mafic volcanics and arc magmatism within continents in a self-consistent geodynamic framework, explaining the enigmatic multimodal volcanism and tectonic record of Archaean cratons(6). Moreover, our model predicts a petrological stratification and tectonic structure of the sub-continental lithospheric mantle, two predictions that are consistent with xenolith(5) and seismic studies, respectively, and consistent with the existence of amid-lithospheric seismic discontinuity(7). The slow gravitational collapse of early continents could have kick-started transient episodes of plate tectonics until, as the Earth's interior cooled and oceanic lithosphere became heavier, plate tectonics became self-sustaining.","Rey, Patrice F.; Coltice, Nicolas; Flament, Nicolas","Rey, PF; Coltice, N; Flament, N",405.0,"[Rey, Patrice F.; Flament, Nicolas] Univ Sydney, Earthbyte Res Grp, Sch Geosci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Coltice, Nicolas] Univ Lyon 1, Ecole Normale Super Lyon, UMR CNRS 5276, Lab Geol Lyon, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France; [Coltice, Nicolas] Inst Univ France, F-75005 Paris, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13728,Article,1476-4687,patrice.rey@sydney.edu.au,+,Australian Government; Institut Universitaire de France; European Research Council (ERC) [617588]; Statoil ASA,"We thank W.

An estimated two billion people suffer these deficiencies(1), causing a loss of 63 million life-years annually(2,3). Most of these people depend on C-3 grains and legumes as their primary dietary source of zinc and iron. Here we report that C-3 grains and legumes have lower concentrations of zinc and iron when grown under field conditions at the elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration predicted for the middle of this century. C-3 crops other than legumes also have lower concentrations of protein, whereas C-4 crops seem to be less affected. Differences between cultivars of a single crop suggest that breeding for decreased sensitivity to atmospheric CO2 concentration could partly address these new challenges to global health.","Myers, Samuel S.; Zanobetti, Antonella; Kloog, Itai; Huybers, Peter; Leakey, Andrew D.

31,131,180.0,"Volatile elements have a fundamental role in the evolution of planets. But how budgets of volatiles were set in planets, and the nature and extent of volatile-depletion of planetary bodies during the earliest stages of Solar System formation remain poorly understood(1,2). The Moon is considered to be volatile-depleted and so it has been predicted that volatile loss should have fractionated stable isotopes of moderately volatile elements(3). One such element, zinc, exhibits strong isotopic fractionation during volatilization in planetary rocks(4,5), but is hardly fractionated during terrestrial igneous processes(6), making it a powerful tracer of the volatile histories of planets. Here we present high-precision zinc isotopic and abundance data which show that lunar magmatic rocks are enriched in the heavy isotopes of zinc and have lower zinc concentrations than terrestrial or Martian igneous rocks. Conversely, Earth and Mars have broadly chondritic zinc isotopic compositions. We show that these variations represent large-scale evaporation of zinc, most probably in the aftermath of the Moon-forming event, rather than small-scale evaporation processes during volcanism. Our results therefore represent evidence for volatile depletion of the Moon through evaporation, and are consistent with a giant impact origin for the Earth and Moon.","Paniello, Randal C.; Day, James M.

32,29,260.0,"The 'certainty effect'(1,2) is a notable violation of expected utility theory by decision makers(3-6). It shows that people's tendency to select the safer of two prospects increases when this prospect provides a good outcome with certainty ( for example, people prefer a monetary gain of 3 with certainty over 4 with a probability of 0.8, but do not prefer 3 with a probability of 0.25 over 4 with a probability of 0.2). Subsequent work on experience- based decision making in rats(7) extended the certainty effect to other animals, suggesting its generality across different species and different decision- making mechanisms. However, an attempt to replicate this study with human subjects showed a surprising 'reversed certainty effect'(8,9), namely, the tendency to prefer the safer option decreases when this prospect is associated with certainty ( and people now prefer 4 with a probability of 0.8 over 3 with certainty). Here we show that these conflicting results can be explained by perceptual noise and that the certainty effect can be restored experimentally by reducing perceptual accuracy. Using complementary experiments in humans and honeybees ( Apis mellifera), we show that by manipulating perceptual accuracy in experience-based tasks, both the certainty and the reversed certainty effects can be exhibited by humans and other animals: the certainty effect emerges when it is difficult to discriminate between the different rewards, whereas the reversed certainty effect emerges when discrimination is easy. Our results fit a simple process- based model of matching behaviour(10,11), capable of explaining the certainty effect in humans and other animals that make repeated decisions based on experience. This mechanism should probably be distinguished from those involved in the original certainty effect that was exhibited by human subjects in single description- based problems(1,2).","Shafir, Sharoni; Reich, Taly; Tsur, Erez; Erev, Ido; Lotem, Arnon","Shafir, S; Reich, T; Tsur, E; Erev, I; Lotem, A",917.0,"[Lotem, Arnon] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, Fac Life Sci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Shafir, Sharoni; Tsur, Erez] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, B Triwaks Bee Res Ctr, Dept Entomol, Fac Agr Food & Environm Qual Sci, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Reich, Taly; Erev, Ido] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Max Wertheimer Minerva Ctr Cognit Studies, Fac Ind Engn & Management, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06841,Article,,erev@techunix.technion.ac.il; lotem@post.tau.ac.il,U51,,,311WV,,,APIS-MELLIFERA; DECISION; CHOICE,7197.0,NATURE,Nature,English,22.0,No,"Shafir, Sharoni/0000-0002-9068-1078","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",12-Jun,5.0,LONDON,18548069.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,"Shafir, Sharoni/D-9821-2011","Lotem, A (reprint author), Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, Fac Life Sci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,47.0,Perceptual accuracy and conflicting effects of certainty on risk-taking behaviour,0.0,29.0,WOS:000256632000043,260.0,453.0,Multidisciplinary Sciences,47.0,arnon,lotem,2857.0,8.0,male,1.0,BsTOfMUAAAAJ,2.0,"(1474, 4126]",na,0,na,0
33,132,207.0,"Animals locate and track chemoattractive gradients in the environment to find food. With its small nervous system, Caenorhabditis elegans is a good model system(1,2) in which to understand how the dynamics of neural activity control this search behaviour. Extensive work on the nematode has identified the neurons that are necessary for the different locomotory behaviours underlying chemotaxis through the use of laser ablation(3-7), activity recording in immobilized animals and the study of mutants(4,5). However, we do not know the neural activity patterns in C. elegans that are sufficient to control its complex chemotactic behaviour. To understand how the activity in its interneurons coordinate different motor programs to lead the animal to food, here we used optogenetics and new optical tools to manipulate neural activity directly in freely moving animals to evoke chemotactic behaviour. By deducing the classes of activity patterns triggered during chemotaxis and exciting individual neurons with these patterns, we identified interneurons that control the essential locomotory programs for this behaviour. Notably, we discovered that controlling the dynamics of activity in just one interneuron pair (AIY) was sufficient to force the animal to locate, turn towards and track virtual light gradients. Two distinct activity patterns triggered in AIY as the animal moved through the gradient controlled reversals and gradual turns to drive chemotactic behaviour. Because AIY neurons are post-synaptic to most chemosensory and thermosensory neurons(8), it is probable that these activity patterns in AIY have an important role in controlling and coordinating different taxis behaviours of the animal.","Kocabas, Askin; Shen, Ching-Han; Guo, Zengcai V.; Ramanathan, Sharad","Kocabas, A; Shen, CH; Guo, ZCV; Ramanathan, S",273.0,"[Kocabas, Askin; Shen, Ching-Han; Ramanathan, Sharad] Harvard Univ, FAS Ctr Syst Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kocabas, Askin; Shen, Ching-Han; Ramanathan, Sharad] Harvard Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Guo, Zengcai V.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA; [Ramanathan, Sharad] Allen Inst Brain Sci, Seattle, WA 98103 USA; [Ramanathan, Sharad] Harvard Univ, Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Ramanathan, Sharad] Harvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11431,Article,,akocabas@cgr.harvard.edu; sharad@post.harvard.edu,+,"Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP) Postdoctoral Fellowship; National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Fellowship; NSF Career Award; Pew Scholar, Klingenstein Fellowship Award; National Institutes of Health (NIH) Pioneer Awards","We thank J.

34,133,222.0,"Pregnancy is an intricately orchestrated process where immune effector cells with fetal specificity are selectively silenced. This requires the sustained expansion of immune-suppressive maternal FOXP3(+) regulatory T cells (T-reg cells), because even transient partial ablation triggers fetal-specific effector T-cell activation and pregnancy loss(1,2). In turn, many idiopathic pregnancy complications proposed to originate from disrupted fetal tolerance are associated with blunted maternal T-reg expansion(3-5). Importantly, however, the antigen specificity and cellular origin of maternal Treg cells that accumulate during gestation remain incompletely defined. Here we show that pregnancy selectively stimulates the accumulation of maternal FOXP3(+) CD4 cells with fetal specificity using tetramer-based enrichment that allows the identification of rare endogenous T cells(6). Interestingly, after delivery, fetal-specific T-reg cells persist at elevated levels, maintain tolerance to pre-existing fetal antigen, and rapidly re-accumulate during subsequent pregnancy. The accelerated expansion of T-reg cells during secondary pregnancy was driven almost exclusively by proliferation of fetal-specific FOXP3(+) cells retained from prior pregnancy, whereas induced FOXP3 expression and proliferation of pre-existing FOXP3(+) cells each contribute to T-reg expansion during primary pregnancy. Furthermore, fetal resorption in secondary compared with primary pregnancy becomes more resilient to partial maternal FOXP3(+) cell ablation. Thus, pregnancy imprints FOXP3(+) CD4 cells that sustain protective regulatory memory to fetal antigen. We anticipate that these findings will spark further investigation on maternal regulatory T-cell specificity that unlocks new strategies for improving pregnancy outcomes and novel approaches for therapeutically exploiting T-reg cell memory.","Rowe, Jared H.; Ertelt, James M.; Xin, Lijun; Way, Sing Sing","Rowe, JH; Ertelt, JM; Xin, LJ; Way, SS",102.0,"[Rowe, Jared H.; Ertelt, James M.; Xin, Lijun; Way, Sing Sing] Univ Minnesota, Sch Med, Ctr Infect Dis & Microbiol Translat Res, Ctr Immunol,Dept Pediat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Rowe, Jared H.; Ertelt, James M.; Xin, Lijun; Way, Sing Sing] Univ Minnesota, Sch Med, Ctr Infect Dis & Microbiol Translat Res, Ctr Immunol,Dept Microbiol, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11462,Article,,singsing.way@cchmc.org,U119,"NIH-NIAID [R01AI087830, R01AI100934]; NIH-NIDDK [F30DK084674]; Burroughs Wellcome Fund","We thank M.

35,14,217.0,"Photosynthetic light reactions establish electron flow in the chloroplast's thylakoid membranes, leading to the production of the ATP and NADPH that participate in carbon fixation. Two modes of electron flow exist-linear electron flow (LEF) from water to NADP 1 via photosystem (PS) II and PSI in series(1) and cyclic electron flow (CEF) around PSI (ref. 2). Although CEF is essential for satisfying the varying demand for ATP, the exact molecule(s) and operational site are as yet unclear. In the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the electron flow shifts from LEF to CEF on preferential excitation of PSII (ref. 3), which is brought about by an energy balancing mechanism between PSII and PSI (state transitions(4)). Here, we isolated a protein super-complex composed of PSI with its own light-harvesting complex (LHCI), the PSII light-harvesting complex (LHCII), the cytochrome b(6)f complex (Cyt bf), ferredoxin (Fd)-NADPH oxidoreductase (FNR), and the integral membrane protein PGRL1 (ref. 5) from C. reinhardtii cells under PSII-favouring conditions. Spectroscopic analyses indicated that on illumination, reducing equivalents from downstream of PSI were transferred to Cyt bf, whereas oxidised PSI was re-reduced by reducing equivalents from Cyt bf, indicating that this supercomplex is engaged in CEF (Supplementary Fig. 1). Thus, formation and dissociation of the PSI-LHCI-LHCII-FNR-Cyt bf-PGRL1 supercomplex not only controlled the energy balance of the two photosystems, but also switched the mode of photosynthetic electron flow.","Iwai, Masakazu; Takizawa, Kenji; Tokutsu, Ryutaro; Okamuro, Akira; Takahashi, Yuichiro; Minagawa, Jun","Iwai, M; Takizawa, K; Tokutsu, R; Okamuro, A; Takahashi, Y; Minagawa, J",1210.0,"[Iwai, Masakazu; Takizawa, Kenji; Tokutsu, Ryutaro; Minagawa, Jun] Hokkaido Univ, Inst Low Temp Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600819, Japan; [Okamuro, Akira; Takahashi, Yuichiro] Okayama Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Okayama 7008530, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08885,Article,,minagawa@lowtem.hokudai.ac.jp,U134,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology [18GS0318, 2120006309, 2157003109]; Japan Science and Technology Agency; Natural Sciences by the Mitsubishi Foundation","We thank S.

36,107,248.0,"DNA replication initiates at defined sites called origins, which serve as binding sites for initiator proteins that recruit the replicative machinery. Origins differ in number and structure across the three domains of life(1) and their properties determine the dynamics of chromosome replication. Bacteria and some archaea replicate from single origins, whereas most archaea and all eukaryotes replicate using multiple origins. Initiation mechanisms that rely on homologous recombination operate in some viruses. Here we show that such mechanisms also operate in archaea. We use deep sequencing to study replication in Haloferax volcanii and identify four chromosomal origins of differing activity. Deletion of individual origins results in perturbed replication dynamics and reduced growth. However, a strain lacking all origins has no apparent defects and grows significantly faster than wild type. Origin-less cells initiate replication at dispersed sites rather than at discrete origins and have an absolute requirement for the recombinase RadA, unlike strains lacking individual origins. Our results demonstrate that homologous recombination alone can efficiently initiate the replication of an entire cellular genome. This raises the question of what purpose replication origins serve and why they have evolved.","Hawkins, Michelle; Malla, Sunir; Blythe, Martin J.; Nieduszynski, Conrad A.; Allers, Thorsten","Hawkins, M; Malla, S; Blythe, MJ; Nieduszynski, CA; Allers, T",544.0,"[Hawkins, Michelle; Nieduszynski, Conrad A.; Allers, Thorsten] Univ Nottingham, Queens Med Ctr, Sch Biol, Nottingham NG7 2UH, England; [Malla, Sunir; Blythe, Martin J.] Univ Nottingham, Queens Med Ctr, Deep Seq, Nottingham NG7 2UH, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12650,Article,1476-4687,conrad.nieduszynski@nottingham.ac.uk; thorsten.allers@nottingham.ac.uk,+,"Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/E023754/1, BB/G001596/1]; Royal Society","This work was supported through the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) (BB/E023754/1, BB/G001596/1).

37,143,261.0,"Since the discovery of the first extrasolar giant planets around Sun-like stars(1,2), evolving observational capabilities have brought us closer to the detection of true Earth analogues. The size of an exoplanet can be determined when it periodically passes in front of (transits) its parent star, causing a decrease in starlight proportional to its radius. The smallest exoplanet hitherto discovered(3) has a radius 1.42 times that of the Earth's radius (R-circle plus), and hence has 2.9 times its volume. Here we report the discovery of two planets, one Earth-sized (1.03 R-circle plus) and the other smaller than the Earth (0.87 R-circle plus), orbiting the star Kepler-20, which is already known to host three other, larger, transiting planets(4). The gravitational pull of the new planets on the parent star is too small to measure with current instrumentation. We apply a statistical method to show that the likelihood of the planetary interpretation of the transit signals is more than three orders of magnitude larger than that of the alternative hypothesis that the signals result from an eclipsing binary star. Theoretical considerations imply that these planets are rocky, with a composition of iron and silicate. The outer planet could have developed a thick water vapour atmosphere.","Fressin, Francois; Torres, Guillermo; Rowe, Jason F.; Charbonneau, David; Rogers, Leslie A.; Ballard, Sarah; Batalha, Natalie M.; Borucki, William J.; Bryson, Stephen T.; Buchhave, Lars A.; Ciardi, David R.; Desert, Jean-Michel; Dressing, Courtney D.; Fabrycky, Daniel C.; Ford, Eric B.; Gautier, Thomas N., III; Henze, Christopher E.; Holman, Matthew J.; Howard, Andrew; Howell, Steve B.; Jenkins, Jon M.; Koch, David G.; Latham, David W.; Lissauer, Jack J.; Marcy, Geoffrey W.; Quinn, Samuel N.; Ragozzine, Darin; Sasselov, Dimitar D.; Seager, Sara; Barclay, Thomas; Mullally, Fergal; Seader, Shawn E.; Still, Martin; Twicken, Joseph D.; Thompson, Susan E.; Uddin, Kamal","Fressin, F; Torres, G; Rowe, JF; Charbonneau, D; Rogers, LA; Ballard, S; Batalha, NM; Borucki, WJ; Bryson, ST; Buchhave, LA; Ciardi, DR; Desert, JM; Dressing, CD; Fabrycky, DC; Ford, EB; Gautier, TN; Henze, CE; Holman, MJ; Howard, A; Howell, SB; Jenkins, JM; Koch, DG; Latham, DW; Lissauer, JJ; Marcy, GW; Quinn, SN; Ragozzine, D; Sasselov, DD; Seager, S; Barclay, T; Mullally, F; Seader, SE; Still, M; Twicken, JD; Thompson, SE; Uddin, K",195.0,"[Fressin, Francois; Torres, Guillermo; Charbonneau, David; Ballard, Sarah; Desert, Jean-Michel; Dressing, Courtney D.; Holman, Matthew J.; Latham, David W.; Quinn, Samuel N.; Ragozzine, Darin; Sasselov, Dimitar D.] Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Rowe, Jason F.; Borucki, William J.; Bryson, Stephen T.; Henze, Christopher E.; Howell, Steve B.; Koch, David G.; Lissauer, Jack J.; Barclay, Thomas; Still, Martin] NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; [Rogers, Leslie A.; Seager, Sara] MIT, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Batalha, Natalie M.] San Jose State Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, San Jose, CA 95192 USA; [Buchhave, Lars A.] Univ Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Inst, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Buchhave, Lars A.] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Star & Planet Format, DK-1350 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Ciardi, David R.] CALTECH, NASA Exoplanet Sci Inst, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Fabrycky, Daniel C.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Astron & Astrophys, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Ford, Eric B.] Univ Florida, Dept Astron, Gainesville, FL 32111 USA; [Gautier, Thomas N., III] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA; [Howard, Andrew; Marcy, Geoffrey W.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Astron, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Jenkins, Jon M.; Mullally, Fergal; Seader, Shawn E.; Twicken, Joseph D.; Thompson, Susan E.] NASA, Ames Res Ctr, SETI Inst, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; [Uddin, Kamal] NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Orbital Sci Corp, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10780,Article,,ffressin@cfa.harvard.edu,198,NASA's Science Mission Directorate,Kepler was competitively selected as the tenth Discovery mission.

38,8,467.0,"Networks have become a key approach to understanding systems of interacting objects, unifying the study of diverse phenomena including biological organisms and human society(1-3). One crucial step when studying the structure and dynamics of networks is to identify communities(4,5): groups of related nodes that correspond to functional subunits such as protein complexes(6,7) or social spheres(8-10). Communities in networks often overlap(9,10) such that nodes simultaneously belong to several groups. Meanwhile, many networks are known to possess hierarchical organization, where communities are recursively grouped into a hierarchical structure(11-13). However, the fact that many real networks have communities with pervasive overlap, where each and every node belongs to more than one group, has the consequence that a global hierarchy of nodes cannot capture the relationships between overlapping groups. Here we reinvent communities as groups of links rather than nodes and show that this unorthodox approach successfully reconciles the antagonistic organizing principles of overlapping communities and hierarchy. In contrast to the existing literature, which has entirely focused on grouping nodes, link communities naturally incorporate overlap while revealing hierarchical organization. We find relevant link communities in many networks, including major biological networks such as protein-protein interaction(6,7,14) and metabolic networks(11,15,16), and show that a large social network(10,17,18) contains hierarchically organized community structures spanning inner-city to regional scales while maintaining pervasive overlap. Our results imply that link communities are fundamental building blocks that reveal overlap and hierarchical organization in networks to be two aspects of the same phenomenon.","Ahn, Yong-Yeol; Bagrow, James P.; Lehmann, Sune","Ahn, YY; Bagrow, JP; Lehmann, S",761.0,"[Lehmann, Sune] Harvard Univ, Inst Quantitat Social Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Ahn, Yong-Yeol; Bagrow, James P.] Northeastern Univ, Dept Phys, Ctr Complex Network Res, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Ahn, Yong-Yeol; Bagrow, James P.] Harvard Univ, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Ctr Canc Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Lehmann, Sune] Northeastern Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Sci, Boston, MA 02115 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09182,Article,1476-4687,sune.lehmann@gmail.com,U11,"James S.

39,83,78.0,"Bedrock erosion in rivers sets the pace of landscape evolution, influences the evolution of orogens and determines the size, shape and relief of mountains(1,2). A variety of models link fluid flow and sediment transport processes to bedrock incision in canyons. The model components that represent sediment transport processes are increasingly well developed(3-5). In contrast, the model components being used to represent fluid flow are largely untested because there are no observations of the flow structure in bedrock canyons. Here we present a 524-kilometre, continuous centreline, acoustic Doppler current profiler survey of the Fraser Canyon in western Canada, which includes 42 individual bedrock canyons. Our observations of three-dimensional flow structure reveal that, as water enters the canyons, a high-velocity core follows the bed surface, causing a velocity inversion (high velocities near the bed and low velocities at the surface). The plunging water then upwells along the canyon walls, resulting in counter-rotating, along-stream coherent flow structures that diverge near the bed. The resulting flow structure promotes deep scour in the bedrock channel floor and undercutting of the canyon walls. This provides a mechanism for channel widening and ensures that the base of the walls is swept clear of the debris that is often deposited there, keeping the walls nearly vertical. These observations reveal that the flow structure in bedrock canyons is more complex than assumed in the models presently used. Fluid flow models that capture the essence of the three-dimensional flow field, using simple phenomenological rules that are computationally tractable, are required to capture the dynamic coupling between flow, bedrock erosion and solid-Earth dynamics.","Venditti, Jeremy G.; Rennie, Colin D.; Bomhof, James; Bradley, Ryan W.; Little, Malcolm; Church, Michael","Venditti, JG; Rennie, CD; Bomhof, J; Bradley, RW; Little, M; Church, M",534.0,"[Venditti, Jeremy G.; Bradley, Ryan W.; Little, Malcolm] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Geog, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Rennie, Colin D.; Bomhof, James] Univ Ottawa, Dept Civil Engn, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Church, Michael] Univ British Columbia, Dept Geog, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13779,Article,1476-4687,jeremy_venditti@sfu.ca,+,Natural Science and Engineering Research Council,"This study was supported by Natural Science and Engineering Research Council grants to M.

40,127,79.0,"Any thermodynamically stable or metastable phase corresponds to a local minimum of a potentially very complicated energy landscape. But however complex the crystal might be, this energy landscape is of parabolic shape near its minima. Roughly speaking, the depth of this energy well with respect to some reference level determines the thermodynamic stability of the system, and the steepness of the parabola near its minimum determines the system's elastic properties. Although changing alloying elements and their concentrations in a given material to enhance certain properties dates back to the Bronze Age(1,2), the systematic search for desirable properties in metastable atomic configurations at a fixed stoichiometry is a very recent tool in materials design(3). Here we demonstrate, using first-principles studies of four binary alloy systems, that the elastic properties of face-centred-cubic intermetallic compounds obey certain rules. We reach two conclusions based on calculations on a huge subset of the face-centred-cubic configuration space. First, the stiffness and the heat of formation are negatively correlated with a nearly constant Spearman correlation(4) for all concentrations. Second, the averaged stiffness of metastable configurations at a fixed concentration decays linearly with their distance to the ground-state line (the phase diagram of an alloy at zero Kelvin). We hope that our methods will help to simplify the quest for new materials with optimal properties from the vast configuration space available.","Maisel, Sascha B.; Hoefler, Michaela; Mueller, Stefan","Maisel, SB; Hofler, M; Muller, S",740.0,"[Maisel, Sascha B.; Hoefler, Michaela; Mueller, Stefan] Hamburg Univ Technol, Inst Adv Ceram, D-21073 Hamburg, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11609,Article,1476-4687,stefan.mueller@tuhh.de,+,DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) [Mu1648/5],Funding by the DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) grant Mu1648/5 is acknowledged.

The full potential of brown macroalgae as feedstocks for commercial-scale fuel ethanol production, however, requires extensive re-engineering of the alginate and mannitol catabolic pathways(1-3) in the standard industrial microbe Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here we present the discovery of an alginate monomer (4-deoxy-L-erythro-5-hexoseulose uronate, or DEHU) transporter from the alginolytic eukaryote Asteromyces cruciatus(4). The genomic integration and overexpression of the gene encoding this transporter, together with the necessary bacterial alginate and deregulated native mannitol catabolism genes, conferred the ability of an S. cerevisiae strain to efficiently metabolize DEHU and mannitol. When this platform was further adapted to grow on mannitol and DEHU under anaerobic conditions, it was capable of ethanol fermentation from mannitol and DEHU, achieving titres of 4.6%(v/v) (36.2 g l(-1)) and yields up to 83% of the maximum theoretical yield from consumed sugars. These results show that all major sugars in brown macroalgae can be used as feedstocks for biofuels and value-added renewable chemicals in a manner that is comparable to traditional arable-land-based feedstocks.","Enquist-Newman, Maria; Faust, Ann Marie E.; Bravo, Daniel D.; Santos, Christine Nicole S.; Raisner, Ryan M.; Hanel, Arthur; Sarvabhowman, Preethi; Le, Chi; Regitsky, Drew D.; Cooper, Susan R.; Peereboom, Lars; Clark, Alana; Martinez, Yessica; Goldsmith, Joshua; Cho, Min Y.; Donohoue, Paul D.; Luo, Lily; Lamberson, Brigit; Tamrakar, Pramila; Kim, Edward J.; Villari, Jeffrey L.; Gill, Avinash; Tripathi, Shital A.; Karamchedu, Padma; Paredes, Carlos J.; Rajgarhia, Vineet; Kotlar, Hans Kristian; Bailey, Richard B.; Miller, Dennis J.; Ohler, Nicholas L.; Swimmer, Candace; Yoshikuni, Yasuo","Enquist-Newman, M; Faust, AME; Bravo, DD; Santos, CNS; Raisner, RM; Hanel, A; Sarvabhowman, P; Le, C; Regitsky, DD; Cooper, SR; Peereboom, L; Clark, A; Martinez, Y; Goldsmith, J; Cho, MY; Donohoue, PD; Luo, L; Lamberson, B; Tamrakar, P; Kim, EJ; Villari, JL; Gill, A; Tripathi, SA; Karamchedu, P; Paredes, CJ; Rajgarhia, V; Kotlar, HK; Bailey, RB; Miller, DJ; Ohler, NL; Swimmer, C; Yoshikuni, Y",239.0,"[Enquist-Newman, Maria; Faust, Ann Marie E.; Bravo, Daniel D.; Santos, Christine Nicole S.; Raisner, Ryan M.; Hanel, Arthur; Sarvabhowman, Preethi; Le, Chi; Regitsky, Drew D.; Cooper, Susan R.; Clark, Alana; Martinez, Yessica; Goldsmith, Joshua; Cho, Min Y.; Donohoue, Paul D.; Luo, Lily; Lamberson, Brigit; Tamrakar, Pramila; Kim, Edward J.; Villari, Jeffrey L.; Gill, Avinash; Tripathi, Shital A.; Karamchedu, Padma; Paredes, Carlos J.; Rajgarhia, Vineet; Bailey, Richard B.; Ohler, Nicholas L.; Swimmer, Candace; Yoshikuni, Yasuo] Bio Architecture Lab Inc, Berkeley, CA 94710 USA; [Peereboom, Lars; Miller, Dennis J.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Chem Engn & Mat Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Kotlar, Hans Kristian] Statoil ASA, Statoil Res Ctr, N-7005 Trondheim, Norway; [Yoshikuni, Yasuo] BALChile SA, Santiago 7550000, Chile; [Yoshikuni, Yasuo] BAL Biofuels SA, Santiago 7550000, Chile",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12771,Article,1476-4687,candacesw@yahoo.com; yoshikuni@ba-lab.com,+,DOE under an Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) award [DE-AR0000006]; CORFO INNOVA CHILE [09CTEI-6866]; Statoil ASA; agency of the US government,"We thank R.

Infiltration of innate immune cells, elevated activities of matrix metalloproteases and increased angiogenesis and vasculature density are a few examples of the similarities between chronic and tumour-associated inflammation(2). Conversely, the elimination of early malignant lesions by immune surveillance, which relies on the cytotoxic activity of tumour-infiltrating T cells or intra-epithelial lymphocytes, is thought to be rate-limiting for the risk to develop cancer(3). Here we show a molecular connection between the rise in tumour-associated inflammation and a lack of tumour immune surveillance. Expression of the heterodimeric cytokine interleukin (IL)-23, but not of its close relative IL-12, is increased in human tumours. Expression of these cytokines antagonistically regulates local inflammatory responses in the tumour microenvironment and infiltration of intra-epithelial lymphocytes. Whereas IL-12 promotes infiltration of cytotoxic T cells, IL-23 promotes inflammatory responses such as upregulation of the matrix metalloprotease MMP9, and increases angiogenesis but reduces CD8 T-cell infiltration. Genetic deletion or antibody-mediated elimination of IL-23 leads to increased infiltration of cytotoxic T cells into the transformed tissue, rendering a protective effect against chemically induced carcinogenesis. Finally, transplanted tumours are growth-restricted in hosts depleted for IL-23 or in IL-23-receptor-deficient mice. Although many strategies for immune therapy of cancer attempt to stimulate an immune response against solid tumours, infiltration of effector cells into the tumour tissue often appears to be a critical hurdle(4-7). We show that IL-23 is an important molecular link between tumour-promoting pro-inflammatory processes and the failure of the adaptive immune surveillance to infiltrate tumours.","Langowski, John L.; Zhang, Xueqing; Wu, Lingling; Mattson, Jeanine D.; Chen, Taiying; Smith, Kathy; Basham, Beth; McClanahan, Terrill; Kastelein, Robert A.; Oft, Martin","Langowski, JL; Zhang, XQ; Wu, LL; Mattson, JD; Chen, TY; Smith, K; Basham, B; McClanahan, T; Kastelein, RA; Oft, M",461.0,"Schering Plough BioPharma, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature04808,Article,,martin.oft@spcorp.com,465,,,067CI,,,AUTOIMMUNE INFLAMMATION; ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY; T-CELLS; CANCER; SKIN; DISTINCT; INTERLEUKIN-12; RESISTANCE; CYTOKINE; IL-12,7101.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",27-Jul,5.0,LONDON,16688182.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,,"Oft, M (reprint author), Schering Plough BioPharma, 901 Calif Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,575.0,IL-23 promotes tumour incidence and growth,1.0,35.0,WOS:000239278900045,314.0,442.0,Multidisciplinary Sciences,616.0,martin,oft,3856.0,3568.0,male,1.0,c_Xosd0AAAAJ,2.0,"(1474, 4126]",33768385,1,709683,1
44,27,225.0,"Roughly 60% of the Earth's outer surface is composed of oceanic crust formed by volcanic processes at mid- ocean ridges. Although only a small fraction of this vast volcanic terrain has been visually surveyed or sampled, the available evidence suggests that explosive eruptions are rare on mid- ocean ridges, particularly at depths below the critical point for seawater ( 3,000 m)(1). A pyroclastic deposit has never been observed on the sea floor below 3,000 m, presumably because the volatile content of mid- ocean- ridge basalts is generally too low to produce the gas fractions required for fragmenting a magma at such high hydrostatic pressure. We employed new deep submergence technologies during an International Polar Year expedition to the Gakkel ridge in the Arctic Basin at 856 E, to acquire photographic and video images of 'zero- age' volcanic terrain on this remote, ice- covered ridge. Here we present images revealing that the axial valley at 4,000 m water depth is blanketed with unconsolidated pyroclastic deposits, including bubble wall fragments (limu o Pele)(2), covering a large ( > 10 km(2)) area. At least 13.5 wt% CO(2) is necessary to fragment magma at these depths(3), which is about tenfold the highest values previously measured in a mid- ocean- ridge basalt(4). These observations raise important questions about the accumulation and discharge of magmatic volatiles at ultraslow spreading rates on the Gakkel ridge(5) and demonstrate that large- scale pyroclastic activity is possible along even the deepest portions of the global mid- ocean ridge volcanic system.","Sohn, Robert A.; Willis, Claire; Humphris, Susan; Shank, Timothy M.; Singh, Hanumant; Edmonds, Henrietta N.; Kunz, Clayton; Hedman, Ulf; Helmke, Elisabeth; Jakuba, Michael; Liljebladh, Bengt; Linder, Julia; Murphy, Christopher; Nakamura, Ko-ichi; Sato, Taichi; Schlindwein, Vera; Stranne, Christian; Tausenfreund, Maria; Upchurch, Lucia; Winsor, Peter; Jakobsson, Martin; Soule, Adam","Sohn, RA; Willis, C; Humphris, S; Shank, TM; Singh, H; Edmonds, HN; Kunz, C; Hedman, U; Helmke, E; Jakuba, M; Liljebladh, B; Linder, J; Murphy, C; Nakamura, KI; Sato, T; Schlindwein, V; Stranne, C; Tausenfreund, M; Upchurch, L; Winsor, P; Jakobsson, M; Soule, A",1236.0,"[Sohn, Robert A.; Willis, Claire; Humphris, Susan; Shank, Timothy M.; Singh, Hanumant; Kunz, Clayton; Murphy, Christopher; Winsor, Peter; Soule, Adam] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Edmonds, Henrietta N.; Upchurch, Lucia] Univ Texas Austin, Inst Marine Sci, Port Aransas, TX 78373 USA; [Hedman, Ulf] Swedish Polar Secretariat, S-10405 Stockholm, Sweden; [Helmke, Elisabeth; Linder, Julia; Schlindwein, Vera; Tausenfreund, Maria] Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, D-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany; [Jakuba, Michael] Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Liljebladh, Bengt; Stranne, Christian] Univ Gothenburg, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Nakamura, Ko-ichi] AIST, Higashi, Tokyo, Japan; [Sato, Taichi] Univ Tokyo, Ocean Res Inst, Tokyo 1648639, Japan; [Jakobsson, Martin] Stockholm Univ, Dept Geol & Geochem, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07075,Article,,rsohn@whoi.edu,1238,,,318FA,,,MID-ATLANTIC RIDGE; DEPOSITS,7199.0,NATURE,Nature,English,23.0,No,"stranne, christian/0000-0003-1004-5213; Upchurch, Lucia/0000-0003-1351-6332; Soule, Adam/0000-0002-4691-6300; Jakobsson, Martin/0000-0002-9033-3559; Sohn, Robert/0000-0002-9050-8603","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",26-Jun,3.0,LONDON,18580949.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,"stranne, christian/A-3932-2010; Jakobsson, Martin/F-6214-2010; stranne, christian/L-4382-2013","Sohn, RA (reprint author), Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,62.0,"Explosive volcanism on the ultraslow-spreading Gakkel ridge, Arctic Ocean",0.0,37.0,WOS:000257075800042,225.0,453.0,Multidisciplinary Sciences,65.0,adam,soule,1638.0,3957.0,male,1.0,-ZGQjLUAAAAJ,2.0,"(1474, 4126]",na,0,298705,1
45,39,59.0,"A piezoelectric material is one that generates a voltage in response to a mechanical strain ( and vice versa). The most useful piezoelectric materials display a transition region in their composition phase diagrams, known as a morphotropic phase boundary(1,2), where the crystal structure changes abruptly and the electromechanical properties are maximal. As a result, modern piezoelectric materials for technological applications are usually complex, engineered, solid solutions, which complicates their manufacture as well as introducing complexity in the study of the microscopic origins of their properties. Here we show that even a pure compound, in this case lead titanate, can display a morphotropic phase boundary under pressure. The results are consistent with first-principles theoretical predictions(3), but show a richer phase diagram than anticipated; moreover, the predicted electromechanical coupling at the transition is larger than any known. Our results show that the high electromechanical coupling in solid solutions with lead titanate is due to tuning of the high- pressure morphotropic phase boundary in pure lead titanate to ambient pressure. We also find that complex microstructures or compositions are not necessary to obtain strong piezoelectricity. This opens the door to the possible discovery of high- performance, pure-compound electromechanical materials, which could greatly decrease costs and expand the utility of piezoelectric materials.","Ahart, Muhtar; Somayazulu, Maddury; Cohen, R.

46,97,405.0,"The low-viscosity layer in the upper mantle, the asthenosphere, is a requirement for plate tectonics(1). The seismic low velocities and the high electrical conductivities of the asthenosphere are attributed either to subsolidus, water-related defects in olivine minerals(2-4) or to a few volume per cent of partial melt(5-8), but these two interpretations have two shortcomings. First, the amount of water stored in olivine is not expected to be higher than 50 parts per million owing to partitioning with other mantle phases(9) (including pargasite amphibole at moderate temperatures(10)) and partial melting at high temperatures(9). Second, elevated melt volume fractions are impeded by the temperatures prevailing in the asthenosphere, which are too low, and by the melt mobility, which is high and can lead to gravitational segregation(11,12). Here we determine the electrical conductivity of carbon-dioxide-rich and water-rich melts, typically produced at the onset of mantle melting. Electrical conductivity increases modestly with moderate amounts of water and carbon dioxide, but it increases drastically once the carbon dioxide content exceeds six weight per cent in the melt. Incipient melts, long-expected to prevail in the asthenosphere(10,13-15), can therefore produce high electrical conductivities there. Taking into account variable degrees of depletion of the mantle in water and carbon dioxide, and their effect on the petrology of incipient melting, we calculated conductivity profiles across the asthenosphere for various tectonic plate ages. Several electrical discontinuities are predicted and match geophysical observations in a consistent petrological and geochemical framework. In moderately aged plates (more than five million years old), incipient melts probably trigger both the seismic low velocities and the high electrical conductivities in the upper part of the asthenosphere, whereas in young plates(4), where seamount volcanism occurs(6), a higher degree of melting is expected.","Sifre, David; Gardes, Emmanuel; Massuyeau, Malcolm; Hashim, Leila; Hier-Majumder, Saswata; Gaillard, Fabrice","Sifre, D; Gardes, E; Massuyeau, M; Hashim, L; Hier-Majumder, S; Gaillard, F",81.0,"[Sifre, David; Gardes, Emmanuel; Massuyeau, Malcolm; Hashim, Leila; Hier-Majumder, Saswata; Gaillard, Fabrice] Univ Orleans, ISTO, UMR 7327, F-45071 Orleans, France; [Sifre, David; Gardes, Emmanuel; Massuyeau, Malcolm; Hashim, Leila; Hier-Majumder, Saswata; Gaillard, Fabrice] CNRS, ISTO, UMR 7327, F-45071 Orleans, France; [Sifre, David; Gardes, Emmanuel; Massuyeau, Malcolm; Hashim, Leila; Hier-Majumder, Saswata; Gaillard, Fabrice] Bur Rech Geol & Minieres, ISTO, UMR 7327, F-45060 Orleans, France; [Gardes, Emmanuel] Univ Caen Basse Normandie, CNRS, Ctr Rech Ions Mat & Photon,UMR 6252, Commissariat Energie Atom,Ecole Natl Super Ingeni, F-14070 Caen, France; [Hier-Majumder, Saswata] Univ Maryland, Dept Geol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Hier-Majumder, Saswata] Univ Maryland, Ctr Sci Computat & Appl Math Modeling, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Hier-Majumder, Saswata] Royal Holloway Univ London, Dept Earth Sci, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13245,Article,1476-4687,fabrice.gaillard@cnrs-orleans.fr,+,European Research Council (ERC) [279790]; French agency for research (ANR) [2010 BLAN62101]; US NSF [EAR1215800]; University of Orleans,"This work, part of the ElectroLith project, benefited from funding by the European Research Council (ERC project #279790) and the French agency for research (ANR project #2010 BLAN62101).

47,79,9.0,"One of the most important classifications in chemistry and within the periodic table is the concept of formal oxidation states(1-4). The preparation and characterization of compounds containing elements with unusual oxidation states is of great interest to chemists(5). The highest experimentally known formal oxidation state of any chemical element is at present VIII2-4, although higher oxidation states have been postulated(6,7). Compounds with oxidation state VIII include several xenon compounds(8) (for example XeO4 and XeO3F2) and the well-characterized species RuO4 and OsO4 (refs 2-4). Iridium, which has nine valence electrons, is predicted to have the greatest chance of being oxidized beyond the VIII oxidation state(1). In recent matrix-isolation experiments, the IrO4 molecule was characterized as an isolated molecule in rare-gas matrices(9). The valence electron configuration of iridium in IrO4 is 5d(1), with a formal oxidation state of VIII. Removal of the remaining d electron from IrO4 would lead to the iridium tetroxide cation ([IrO4](+)), which was recently predicted to be stable(10) and in which iridium is in a formal oxidation state of IX. There has been some speculation about the formation of [IrO4](+) species(11,12), but these experimental observations have not been structurally confirmed. Here we report the formation of [IrO4](+) and its identification by infrared photodissociation spectroscopy. Quantum-chemical calculations were carried out at the highest level of theory that is available today, and predict that the iridium tetroxide cation, with a T-d-symmetrical structure and a d(0) electron configuration, is the most stable of all possible [IrO4](+) isomers.","Wang, Guanjun; Zhou, Mingfei; Goettel, James T.; Schrobilgen, Gary J.; Su, Jing; Li, Jun; Schloeder, Tobias; Riedel, Sebastian","Wang, GJ; Zhou, MF; Goettel, JT; Schrobilgen, GJ; Su, J; Li, J; Schloder, T; Riedel, S",475.0,"[Wang, Guanjun; Zhou, Mingfei] Fudan Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Chem Energy Mat, Shanghai Key Lab Mol Catalysts & Innovat Mat, Dept Chem, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Goettel, James T.; Schrobilgen, Gary J.] McMaster Univ, Dept Chem, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M1, Canada; [Su, Jing; Li, Jun] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Chem, Minist Educ, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Su, Jing; Li, Jun] Tsinghua Univ, Key Lab Organ Optoelect & Mol Engn, Minist Educ, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Schloeder, Tobias; Riedel, Sebastian] Univ Freiburg, Inst Anorgan & Analyt Chem, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Riedel, Sebastian] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Chem & Biochem Anorgan Chem, D-14195 Berlin, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13795,Article,1476-4687,mfzhou@fudan.edu.cn; schrobil@mcmaster.ca; sriedel@psichem.de,+,"Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2013CB834603, 2012YQ220113-3]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [21173053, 21433005, 91026003]; Committee of Science and Technology of Shanghai [13XD1400800]; Fonds der Chemischen Industrie; GRK [1582]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (2013CB834603 and 2012YQ220113-3), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant nos 21173053, 21433005 and 91026003), the Committee of Science and Technology of Shanghai (13XD1400800), the Fonds der Chemischen Industrie and the GRK 1582 'Fluorine as a key element'.

48,99,475.0,"The impact of nutritional status during fetal life on the overall health of adults has been recognized(1); however, dietary effects on the developing immune system are largely unknown. Development of secondary lymphoid organs occurs during embryogenesis and is considered to be developmentally programmed(2,3). Secondary lymphoid organ formation depends on a subset of type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) named lymphoid tissue inducer(LTi) cells(2-5). Here we show that mouse fetal ILC3s are controlled by cell-autonomous retinoic acid (RA) signalling in utero, which pre-sets the immune fitness in adulthood. We found that embryonic lymphoid organs contain ILC progenitors that differentiate locally into mature LTi cells. Local LTi cell differentiation was controlled by maternal retinoid intake and fetal RA signalling acting in a haematopoietic cell-autonomous manner. RA controlled LTi cell maturation upstream of the transcription factor ROR gamma t. Accordingly, enforced expression of Rorgt restored maturation of LTi cells with impaired RA signalling, whereas RA receptors directly regulated the Rorgt locus. Finally, we established that maternal levels of dietary retinoids control the size of secondary lymphoid organs and the efficiency of immune responses in the adult offspring. Our results reveal a molecular link between maternal nutrients and the formation of immune structures required for resistance to infection in the offspring.","van de Pavert, Serge A.; Ferreira, Manuela; Domingues, Rita G.; Ribeiro, Helder; Molenaar, Rosalie; Moreira-Santos, Lara; Almeida, Francisca F.; Ibiza, Sales; Barbosa, Ines; Goverse, Gera; Labao-Almeida, Carlos; Godinho-Silva, Cristina; Konijn, Tanja; Schooneman, Dennis; O'Toole, Tom; Mizee, Mark R.; Habani, Yasmin; Haak, Esther; Santori, Fabio R.; Littman, Dan R.; Schulte-Merker, Stefan; Dzierzak, Elaine; Simas, J.

49,72,318.0,"Tropical mountains are hot spots of biodiversity and endemism(1-3), but the evolutionary origins of their unique biotas are poorly understood(4). In varying degrees, local and regional extinction, long-distance colonization, and local recruitment may all contribute to the exceptional character of these communities(5). Also, it is debated whether mountain endemics mostly originate from local lowland taxa, or from lineages that reach the mountain by long-range dispersal from cool localities elsewhere(6). Here we investigate the evolutionary routes to endemism by sampling an entire tropical mountain biota on the 4,095-metre-high Mount Kinabalu in Sabah, East Malaysia. We discover that most of its unique biodiversity is younger than the mountain itself (6 million years), and comprises a mix of immigrant pre-adapted lineages and descendants from local lowland ancestors, although substantial shifts from lower to higher vegetation zones in this latter group were rare. These insights could improve forecasts of the likelihood of extinction and 'evolutionary rescue'(7) in montane biodiversity hot spots under climate change scenarios.","Merckx, Vincent S. F.

50,26,190.0,"All adult flatfishes ( Pleuronectiformes), including the gastronomically familiar plaice, sole, turbot and halibut, have highly asymmetrical skulls, with both eyes placed on one side of the head. This arrangement, one of the most extraordinary anatomical specializations among vertebrates, arises through migration of one eye during late larval development. Although the transformation of symmetrical larvae into asymmetrical juveniles is well documented(1-7), the evolutionary origins of flatfish asymmetry are uncertain(1,2) because there are no transitional forms linking flatfishes with their symmetrical relatives(8,9). The supposed inviability of such intermediates gave pleuronectiforms a prominent role in evolutionary debates(10-16), leading to attacks on natural selection(11) and arguments for saltatory change(14,15). Here I show that Amphistium and the new genus Heteronectes, both extinct spiny- finned fishes from the Eocene epoch of Europe, are the most primitive pleuronectiforms known. The orbital region of the skull in both taxa is strongly asymmetrical, as in living flatfishes, but these genera retain many primitive characters unknown in extant forms. Most remarkably, orbital migration was incomplete in Amphistium and Heteronectes, with eyes remaining on opposite sides of the head in post- metamorphic individuals. This condition is intermediate between that in living pleuronectiforms and the arrangement found in other fishes. Amphistium and Heteronectes indicate that the evolution of the profound cranial asymmetry of extant flatfishes was gradual in nature.","Friedman, Matt","Friedman, M",209.0,"[Friedman, Matt] Univ Chicago, Comm Evolutionary Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Friedman, Matt] Field Museum Nat Hist, Dept Geol, Chicago, IL 60605 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07108,Article,,mattf@uchicago.edu,212,,,323RU,,,PLEURONECTIFORMES; ACANTHOMORPHS; PHYLOGENY; BEHAVIOR; RECORD,7201.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",10-Jul,4.0,LONDON,18615083.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,"Friedman, Matt/F-6991-2012","Friedman, M (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Comm Evolutionary Biol, 1025 E 57th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,59.0,The evolutionary origin of flatfish asymmetry,17.0,101.0,WOS:000257466900042,190.0,454.0,Multidisciplinary Sciences,64.0,matt,friedman,2883.0,4915.0,male,1.0,4d4zhI8AAAAJ,2.0,"(1474, 4126]",na,0,na,0
51,90,236.0,"Convergent margin volcanism originates with partial melting, primarily of the upper mantle, into which the subducting slab descends(1,2). Melting of this material can occur in one of two ways. The flow induced in the mantle by the slab can result in upwelling and melting through adiabatic decompression(1,3). Alternatively, fluids released from the descending slab through dehydration reactions can migrate into the hot mantle wedge, inducing melting by lowering the solidus temperature(2,4). The two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive(1). In either case, the buoyant melts make their way towards the surface to reside in the crust or to be extruded as lava. Here we use magnetotelluric data collected across the central state of Washington, USA, to image the complete pathway for the fluid-melt phase. By incorporating constraints from a collocated seismic study(5) into the magnetotelluric inversion process, we obtain superior constraints on the fluids and melt in a subduction setting. Specifically, we are able to identify and connect fluid release at or near the top of the slab, migration of fluids into the overlying mantle wedge, melting in the wedge, and transport of the melt/fluid phase to a reservoir in the crust beneath Mt Rainier.","McGary, R.

52,37,498.0,"Apomixis, the formation of asexual seeds in plants, leads to populations that are genetically uniform maternal clones. The transfer of apomixis to crop plants holds great promise in plant breeding for fixation of heterozygosity and hybrid vigour because it would allow the propagation of hybrids over successive generations(1,2). Apomixis involves the production of unreduced ( diploid) female gametes that retain the genotype of the parent plant ( apomeiosis), followed by parthenogenetic development of the egg cell into an embryo and the formation of functional endosperm(3). The molecular mechanisms underlying apomixis are unknown. Here we show that mutation of the Arabidopsis gene DYAD/ SWITCH1 (SWI1)(4,5), a regulator of meiotic chromosome organization, leads to apomeiosis. We found that most fertile ovules in dyad plants form seeds that are triploid and that arise from the fertilization of an unreduced female gamete by a haploid male gamete. The unreduced female gametes fully retain parental heterozygosity across the genome, which is characteristic of apomeiosis. Our results show that the alteration of a single gene in a sexual plant can bring about functional apomeiosis, a major component of apomixis.","Ravi, Maruthachalam; Marimuthu, Mohan P.

53,89,224.0,"During development, thalamocortical (TC) input has a critical role in the spatial delineation and patterning of cortical areas(1-6), yet the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive cortical neuron differentiation are poorly understood. In the primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory cortex, layer 4 (L4) neurons receive mutually exclusive input originating from two thalamic nuclei(7,8): the ventrobasalis (VB), which conveys tactile input(9,10), and the posterior nucleus (Po), which conveys modulatory and nociceptive input(11-14). Recently, we have shown that L4 neuron identity is not fully committed postnatally(15), implying a capacity for TC input to influence differentiation during cortical circuit assembly. Here we investigate whether the cell-type-specific molecular and functional identity of L4 neurons is instructed by the origin of their TC input. Genetic ablation of the VB at birth resulted in an anatomical and functional rewiring of Po projections onto L4 neurons in S1. This induced acquisition of Po input led to a respecification of postsynaptic L4 neurons, which developed functional molecular features of Po-target neurons while repressing VB-target traits. Respecified L4 neurons were able to respond both to touch and to noxious stimuli, in sharp contrast to the normal segregation of these sensory modalities in distinct cortical circuits. These findings reveal a behaviourally relevant TC-input-type-specific control over the molecular and functional differentiation of postsynaptic L4 neurons and cognate intracortical circuits, which instructs the development of modality-specific neuronal and circuit properties during corticogenesis.","Pouchelon, Gabrielle; Gambino, Frederic; Bellone, Camilla; Telley, Ludovic; Vitali, Ilaria; Luescher, Christian; Holtmaat, Anthony; Jabaudon, Denis","Pouchelon, G; Gambino, F; Bellone, C; Telley, L; Vitali, I; Luscher, C; Holtmaat, A; Jabaudon, D",471.0,"[Pouchelon, Gabrielle; Gambino, Frederic; Bellone, Camilla; Telley, Ludovic; Vitali, Ilaria; Luescher, Christian; Holtmaat, Anthony; Jabaudon, Denis] Univ Geneva, Fac Med, Dept Basic Neurosci, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Luescher, Christian; Jabaudon, Denis] Univ Hosp Geneva, Clin Neurol, Dept Clin Neurosci, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Luescher, Christian; Jabaudon, Denis] Univ Geneva, Inst Genet & Genom Geneva IGE3, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13390,Article,1476-4687,denis.jabaudon@unige.ch,+,Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [PP00P3_123447]; Leenaards Foundation; Synapsis Foundation; NARSAD Foundation; Ambizione grant from the SNF; Gertrude von Meissner Foundation; SNF; Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI); SNF [31003A-135631]; EMBO; International Foundation for Research in Paraplegia; Hans Wilsdorf Foundation,"We thank S.

54,32,443.0,"Molecular mechanisms regulating animal seasonal breeding in response to changing photoperiod are not well understood. Rapid induction of gene expression of thyroid- hormone- activating enzyme ( type 2 deiodinase, DIO2) in the mediobasal hypothalamus ( MBH) of the Japanese quail ( Coturnix japonica) is the earliest event yet recorded in the photoperiodic signal transduction pathway. Here we show cascades of gene expression in the quail MBH associated with the initiation of photoinduced secretion of luteinizing hormone. We identified two waves of gene expression. The first was initiated about 14 h after dawn of the first long day and included increased thyrotrophin ( TSH) beta- subunit expression in the pars tuberalis; the second occurred approximately 4 h later and included increased expression of DIO2. Intracerebroventricular ( ICV) administration of TSH to short- day quail stimulated gonadal growth and expression of DIO2 which was shown to be mediated through a TSH receptor - cyclic AMP ( cAMP) signalling pathway. Increased TSH in the pars tuberalis therefore seems to trigger long- day photoinduced seasonal breeding.","Nakao, Nobuhiro; Ono, Hiroko; Yamamura, Takashi; Anraku, Tsubasa; Takagi, Tsuyoshi; Higashi, Kumiko; Yasuo, Shinobu; Katou, Yasuhiro; Kageyama, Saburo; Uno, Yumiko; Kasukawa, Takeya; Iigo, Masayuki; Sharp, Peter J.; Iwasawa, Atsushi; Suzuki, Yutaka; Sugano, Sumio; Niimi, Teruyuki; Mizutani, Makoto; Namikawa, Takao; Ebihara, Shizufumi; Ueda, Hiroki R.; Yoshimura, Takashi","Nakao, N; Ono, H; Yamamura, T; Anraku, T; Takagi, T; Higashi, K; Yasuo, S; Katou, Y; Kageyama, S; Uno, Y; Kasukawa, T; Iigo, M; Sharp, PJ; Iwasawa, A; Suzuki, Y; Sugano, S; Niimi, T; Mizutani, M; Namikawa, T; Ebihara, S; Ueda, HR; Yoshimura, T",317.0,"[Nakao, Nobuhiro; Ono, Hiroko; Yamamura, Takashi; Anraku, Tsubasa; Takagi, Tsuyoshi; Higashi, Kumiko; Yasuo, Shinobu; Katou, Yasuhiro; Kageyama, Saburo; Uno, Yumiko; Ebihara, Shizufumi; Yoshimura, Takashi] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Bioagr Sci, Chikusa Ku, Div Biomodelling, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Kasukawa, Takeya; Ueda, Hiroki R.] RIKEN, Funct Genom Subunit, Ctr Dev Biol, Chuo Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan; [Iigo, Masayuki] Utsunomiya Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Appl Biochem, Utsunomiya, Tochigi 3218505, Japan; [Sharp, Peter J.] Univ Edinburgh, Div Genet & Genom, Roslin Inst, Roslin EH25 9PS, Midlothian, Scotland; [Sharp, Peter J.] Univ Edinburgh, Div Genet & Genom, Royal Dick Sch Vet Studies, Roslin EH25 9PS, Midlothian, Scotland; [Iwasawa, Atsushi] Gifu Univ, Lab Comparat Biochem, Grad Sch Appl Biol Sci, Gifu 5011193, Japan; [Suzuki, Yutaka; Sugano, Sumio] Univ Tokyo, Dept Med Genome Sci, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; [Niimi, Teruyuki] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Bioagr Sci, Chikusa Ku, Div Biofunct Dev, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Mizutani, Makoto; Namikawa, Takao; Ebihara, Shizufumi; Yoshimura, Takashi] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Bioagr Sci, Chikusa Ku, Avian Biosci Res Ctr, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Ueda, Hiroki R.] RIKEN, Lab Syst Biol, Ctr Dev Biol, Chuo Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan; [Yoshimura, Takashi] Nagoya Univ, Chikusa Ku, Inst Adv Res, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06738,Article,,takashiy@agr.nagoya-u.ac.jp,U1,,,276BX,,,II IODOTHYRONINE DEIODINASE; COTURNIX-COTURNIX-JAPONICA; JAPANESE-QUAIL; CHICKEN THYROTROPIN; GENE-EXPRESSION; CIRCADIAN CLOCK; BETA-SUBUNIT; HORMONE; RECEPTOR; BRAIN,7185.0,NATURE,Nature,English,39.0,No,"Yoshimura, Takashi/0000-0001-7018-9652; Kasukawa, Takeya/0000-0001-5085-0802","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",20-Mar,7.0,LONDON,18354476.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,"Yoshimura, Takashi/C-8306-2012; Ueda, Hiroki/C-5037-2014; Kasukawa, Takeya/N-5070-2015","Yoshimura, T (reprint author), Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Bioagr Sci, Chikusa Ku, Div Biomodelling, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,233.0,Thyrotrophin in the pars tuberalis triggers photoperiodic response,0.0,48.0,WOS:000254117400039,443.0,452.0,Multidisciplinary Sciences,240.0,takashi,yoshimura,2197.0,16.0,male,1.0,70uGLR0AAAAJ,2.0,"(1474, 4126]",34529736,1,18969,1
55,85,143.0,"Knowledge of the early evolution of fish largely depends on soft-bodied material from the Lower (Series 2) Cambrian period of South China(1,2). Owing to the rarity of some of these forms and a general lack of comparative material from other deposits, interpretations of various features remain controversial(3,4), as do their wider relationships amongst post-Cambrian early un-skeletonized jawless vertebrates. Here we redescribe Metaspriggina(5) on the basis of new material from the Burgess Shale and exceptionally preserved material collected near Marble Canyon, British Columbia(6), and three other Cambrian Burgess Shale-type deposits from Laurentia. This primitive fish displays unambiguous vertebrate features: a notochord, a pair of prominent camera-type eyes, paired nasal sacs, possible cranium and arcualia, W-shaped myomeres, and a post-anal tail. A striking feature is the branchial area with an array of bipartite bars. Apart from the anterior most bar, which appears to be slightly thicker, each is associated with externally located gills, possibly housed in pouches. Phylogenetic analysis places Metaspriggina as a basal vertebrate, apparently close to the Chengjiang taxa Haikouichthys(1-4) and Myllokunmingia(1), demonstrating also that this primitive group of fish was cosmopolitan during Lower-Middle Cambrian times (Series 2-3). However, the arrangement of the branchial region in Metaspriggina has wider implications for reconstructing the morphology of the primitive vertebrate. Each bipartite bar is identified as being respectively equivalent to an epibranchial and ceratobranchial. This configuration suggests that a bipartite arrangement is primitive and reinforces the view that the branchial basket of lampreys(7) is probably derived. Other features of Metaspriggina, including the external position of the gills and possible absence of a gill opposite the more robust anterior-most bar, are characteristic of gnathostomes(8) and so may be primitive within vertebrates.","Morris, Simon Conway; Caron, Jean-Bernard","Morris, SC; Caron, JB",419.0,"[Morris, Simon Conway] Univ Cambridge, Dept Earth Sci, Cambridge CB2 3EQ, England; [Caron, Jean-Bernard] Royal Ontario Museum, Dept Nat Hist Palaeobiol, Toronto, ON M5S 2C6, Canada; [Caron, Jean-Bernard] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13414,Article,1476-4687,sc113@cam.ac.uk; jcaron@rom.on.ca,U413,"Department of Earth Sciences and St John's College, Cambridge; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council [341944]; Royal Ontario Museum [53]","We thank T.

57,33,449.0,"To understand the processes that regulate the abundance and persistence of wild populations is a fundamental goal of ecology and a prerequisite for the management of living resources. Variable abundance data, however, make the demonstration of regulation processes challenging(1-3). A previously overlooked aspect in understanding how populations are regulated(4-6) is the possibility that the pattern of variability - its strength as a function of population size - may be more than 'noise', thus revealing much about the characteristics of population regulation. Here we show that patterns in survival variability do provide evidence of regulation through density. Using a large, global compilation of marine, anadromous and freshwater fisheries data, we examine the relationship between the variability of survival and population abundance. The interannual variability in progeny survival increases at low adult abundance in an inversely density- dependent fashion. This pattern is consistent with models in which density dependence enters after the larval stage. The findings are compatible with very simple forms of density dependence: even a linear increase of juvenile mortality with adult density adequately explains the results. The model predictions explain why populations with strong regulation may experience large increases in variability at low densities(7). Furthermore, the inverse relationship between survival variability and the strength of density dependence has important consequences for fisheries management and recovery, and population persistence or extinction(8-10).","Minto, Coilin; Myers, Ransom A.; Blanchard, Wade","Minto, C; Myers, RA; Blanchard, W",344.0,"[Minto, Coilin] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS B3H 4J1, Canada; [Blanchard, Wade] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Halifax, NS B3H 3J5, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06605,Article,,mintoc@mathstat.dal.ca,U6,,,276BX,,,MARINE DEMERSAL FISH; DEPENDENCE; RECRUITMENT; MORTALITY; TIME; COD; AGE,7185.0,NATURE,Nature,English,33.0,No,"Minto, Coilin/0000-0003-0630-6775","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",20-Mar,5.0,LONDON,18354480.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,,"Minto, C (reprint author), Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS B3H 4J1, Canada.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,51.0,Survival variability and population density in fish populations,2.0,66.0,WOS:000254117400045,449.0,452.0,Multidisciplinary Sciences,52.0,wade,blanchard,1987.0,157.0,male,1.0,SBPYOOMAAAAJ,2.0,"(1474, 4126]",38633853,1,184420,1
58,16,323.0,"The life of a star is dominantly determined by the physical processes in the stellar interior. Unfortunately, we still have a poor understanding of how the stellar gas mixes near the stellar core, preventing precise predictions of stellar evolution(1). The unknown nature of the mixing processes as well as the extent of the central mixed region is particularly problematic for massive stars(2). Oscillations in stars with masses a few times that of the Sun offer a unique opportunity to disentangle the nature of various mixing processes, through the distinct signature they leave on period spacings in the gravity mode spectrum(3). Here we report the detection of numerous gravity modes in a young star with a mass of about seven solar masses. The mean period spacing allows us to estimate the extent of the convective core, and the clear periodic deviation from the mean constrains the location of the chemical transition zone to be at about 10 per cent of the radius and rules out a clearcut profile.","Degroote, Pieter; Aerts, Conny; Baglin, Annie; Miglio, Andrea; Briquet, Maryline; Noels, Arlette; Niemczura, Ewa; Montalban, Josefina; Bloemen, Steven; Oreiro, Raquel; Vuckovic, Maja; Smolders, Kristof; Auvergne, Michel; Baudin, Frederic; Catala, Claude; Michel, Eric","Degroote, P; Aerts, C; Baglin, A; Miglio, A; Briquet, M; Noels, A; Niemczura, E; Montalban, J; Bloemen, S; Oreiro, R; Vuckovic, M; Smolders, K; Auvergne, M; Baudin, F; Catala, C; Michel, E",259.0,"[Degroote, Pieter; Aerts, Conny; Briquet, Maryline; Bloemen, Steven; Oreiro, Raquel; Vuckovic, Maja; Smolders, Kristof] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Inst Sterrenkunde, B-3001 Louvain, Belgium; [Aerts, Conny] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Astrophys, IMAPP, NL-6500 GL Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Baglin, Annie; Auvergne, Michel; Catala, Claude; Michel, Eric] Univ Paris 07, Univ Paris 06, Observ Paris, LESIA,UMR8109, F-92195 Meudon, France; [Miglio, Andrea; Noels, Arlette; Montalban, Josefina] Univ Liege, Inst Astrophys & Geophys, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; [Niemczura, Ewa] Univ Wroclaw, Astron Inst, PL-51622 Wroclaw, Poland; [Baudin, Frederic] Inst Astrophys Spatiale, F-91405 Orsay, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08864,Article,1476-4687,pieter.degroote@ster.kuleuven.ac.be,261,European Research Council under the European Community; Research Council of KU Leuven; Belgian Federal Science Policy,"The research leading to these results received funding from the European Research Council under the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (PROSPERITY), from the Research Council of KU Leuven and from the Belgian Federal Science Policy.

60,4,229.0,"Many physiological events require transient increases in cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations. Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are ion channels that govern the release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic and sarcoplasmic reticulum(1). Mutations in RyRs can lead to severe genetic conditions that affect both cardiac and skeletal muscle, but locating the mutated residues in the full-length channel structure has been difficult(2,3). Here we show the 2.5 angstrom resolution crystal structure of a region spanning three domains of RyR type 1 (RyR1), encompassing amino acid residues 1-559. The domains interact with each other through a predominantly hydrophilic interface. Docking in RyR1 electron microscopy maps(4,5) unambiguously places the domains in the cytoplasmic portion of the channel, forming a 240-kDa cytoplasmic vestibule around the four-fold symmetry axis. We pinpoint the exact locations of more than 50 disease-associated mutations in full-length RyR1 and RyR2. The mutations can be classified into three groups: those that destabilize the interfaces between the three amino-terminal domains, disturb the folding of individual domains or affect one of six interfaces with other parts of the receptor. We propose a model whereby the opening of a RyR coincides with allosterically coupled motions within the N-terminal domains. This process can be affected by mutations that target various interfaces within and across subunits. The crystal structure provides a framework to understand the many disease-associated mutations in RyRs that have been studied using functional methods, and will be useful for developing new strategies to modulate RyR function in disease states.","Tung, Ching-Chieh; Lobo, Paolo A.; Kimlicka, Lynn; Van Petegem, Filip","Tung, CC; Lobo, PA; Kimlicka, L; Van Petegem, F",585.0,"[Tung, Ching-Chieh; Lobo, Paolo A.; Kimlicka, Lynn; Van Petegem, Filip] Univ British Columbia, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09471,Article,,filip.vanpetegem@gmail.com,U267,Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada,"We thank the staff at beamline 08ID-1 of the Canadian Light source, the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource, K.

61,68,273.0,"X chromosomes evolve differently from autosomes, but general governing principles have not emerged(1). For example, genes with male-biased expression are under-represented on the X chromosome of D. melanogaster(2), but are randomly distributed in the genome of Anopheles gambiae(3). In direct global profiling experiments using species-specific microarrays, we find a nearly identical paucity of genes with male-biased expression on D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D. yakuba, D. ananassae, D. virilis and D. mojavensis X chromosomes. We observe the same under-representation on the neo-X of D. pseudoobscura. It has been suggested that precocious meiotic silencing of the X chromosome accounts for reduced X chromosome male-biased expression in nematodes(4), mammals(5) and Drosophila(6). We show that X chromosome genes with male-biased expression are under-represented in somatic cells and in mitotic male germ cells. These data are incompatible with simple X chromosome inactivation models. Using expression profiling and comparative sequence analysis, we show that selective gene extinction on the X chromosome, creation of new genes on autosomes and changed genomic location of existing genes contribute to the unusual X chromosome gene content.","Sturgill, David; Zhang, Yu; Parisi, Michael; Oliver, Brian","Sturgill, D; Zhang, Y; Parisi, M; Oliver, B",238.0,"NIDDKD, Cellular & Dev Biol Lab, NIH, US Dept HHS, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06330,Article,,davidsturgill@niddk.nih.gov; oliver@helix.nih.gov,U3,Intramural NIH HHS [Z01 DK015600-12],,228RC,,,SEX-BIASED GENES; EXPRESSION; EVOLUTION; INACTIVATION; ELEGANS,7167.0,NATURE,Nature,English,25.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",8-Nov,5.0,LONDON,17994090.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007.0,,"Sturgill, D (reprint author), NIDDKD, Cellular & Dev Biol Lab, NIH, US Dept HHS, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,146.0,Demasculinization of X chromosomes in the Drosophila genus,0.0,20.0,WOS:000250746200045,273.0,450.0,Multidisciplinary Sciences,146.0,brian,oliver,9109.0,4600.0,male,1.0,gg3UPR8AAAAJ,3.0,"(4126, 9345]",na,0,43427,1
62,113,428.0,"Sex determination in animals is amazingly plastic. Vertebrates display contrasting strategies ranging from complete genetic control of sex (genotypic sex determination) to environmentally determined sex (for example, temperature-dependent sex determination)(1). Phylogenetic analyses suggest frequent evolutionary transitions between genotypic and temperature-dependent sex determination in environmentally sensitive lineages, including reptiles(2). These transitions are thought to involve a genotypic system becoming sensitive to temperature, with sex determined by gene-environment interactions(3). Most mechanistic models of transitions invoke a role for sex reversal(3-5). Sex reversal has not yet been demonstrated in nature for any amniote, although it occurs in fish(6) and rarely in amphibians(7,8). Here we make the first report of reptile sex reversal in the wild, in the Australian bearded dragon (Pogona vitticeps), and use sex-reversed animals to experimentally induce a rapid transition from genotypic to temperature-dependent sex determination. Controlled mating of normal males to sex-reversed females produces viable and fertile offspring whose phenotypic sex is determined solely by temperature (temperature-dependent sex determination). The W sex chromosome is eliminated from this lineage in the first generation. The instantaneous creation of a lineage of ZZ temperature-sensitive animals reveals a novel, climate-induced pathway for the rapid transition between genetic and temperature-dependent sex determination, and adds to concern about adaptation to rapid global climate change.","Holleley, Clare E.; O'Meally, Denis; Sarre, Stephen D.; Graves, Jennifer A.

63,146,123.0,"The 'snowline' conventionally divides Solar System objects into dry bodies, ranging out to the main asteroid belt, and icy bodies beyond the belt. Models suggest that some of the icy bodies may have migrated into the asteroid belt(1). Recent observations indicate the presence of water ice on the surface of some asteroids(2-4), with sublimation(5) a potential reason for the dust activity observed on others. Hydrated minerals have been found(6-8) on the surface of the largest object in the asteroid belt, the dwarf planet (1) Ceres, which is thought to be differentiated into a silicate core with an icy mantle(9-11). The presence of water vapour around Ceres was suggested by a marginal detection of the photodissociation product of water, hydroxyl (ref. 12), but could not be confirmed by later, more sensitive observations(13). Here we report the detection of water vapour around Ceres, with at least 10(26) molecules being produced per second, originating from localized sources that seem to be linked to mid-latitude regions on the surface(14,15). The water evaporation could be due to comet-like sublimation or to cryo-volcanism, in which volcanoes erupt volatiles such as water instead of molten rocks.","Kueppers, Michael; O'Rourke, Laurence; Bockelee-Morvan, Dominique; Zakharov, Vladimir; Lee, Seungwon; von Allmen, Paul; Carry, Benoit; Teyssier, David; Marston, Anthony; Mueller, Thomas; Crovisier, Jacques; Barucci, M.

64,119,11.0,"The most important energy development of the past decade has been the wide deployment of hydraulic fracturing technologies that enable the production of previously uneconomic shale gas resources in North America(1). If these advanced gas production technologies were to be deployed globally, the energy market could see a large influx of economically competitive unconventional gas resources(2). The climate implications of such abundant natural gas have been hotly debated. Some researchers have observed that abundant natural gas substituting for coal could reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions(3-6). Others have reported that the non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions associated with shale gas production make its lifecycle emissions higher than those of coal(7,8). Assessment of the full impact of abundant gas on climate change requires an integrated approach to the global energyeconomyclimate systems, but the literature has been limited in either its geographic scope(9,10) or its coverage of greenhouse gases(2). Here we show that market-driven increases in global supplies of unconventional natural gas do not discernibly reduce the trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions or climate forcing. Our results, based on simulations from five state-of-the-art integrated assessment models(11) of energyeconomyclimate systems independently forced by an abundant gas scenario, project large additional natural gas consumption of up to +170 per cent by 2050. The impact on CO2 emissions, however, is found to be much smaller (from -2 per cent to +11 per cent), and a majority of the models reported a small increase in climate forcing (from -0.3 per cent to +7 per cent) associated with the increased use of abundant gas. Our results show that although market penetration of globally abundant gas may substantially change the future energy system, it is not necessarily an effective substitute for climate change mitigation policy(9,10).","McJeon, Haewon; Edmonds, Jae; Bauer, Nico; Clarke, Leon; Fisher, Brian; Flannery, Brian P.; Hilaire, Jerome; Krey, Volker; Marangoni, Giacomo; Mi, Raymond; Riahi, Keywan; Rogner, Holger; Tavoni, Massimo","McJeon, H; Edmonds, J; Bauer, N; Clarke, L; Fisher, B; Flannery, BP; Hilaire, J; Krey, V; Marangoni, G; Mi, R; Riahi, K; Rogner, H; Tavoni, M",482.0,"[McJeon, Haewon; Edmonds, Jae; Clarke, Leon] Pacific NW Natl Lab, JGCRI, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Bauer, Nico; Hilaire, Jerome] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Fisher, Brian; Mi, Raymond] BAEconomics, Kingston, ACT 2604, Australia; [Flannery, Brian P.] Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Krey, Volker; Riahi, Keywan; Rogner, Holger] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Marangoni, Giacomo; Tavoni, Massimo] Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, I-20156 Milan, Italy; [Marangoni, Giacomo; Tavoni, Massimo] Politecn Milan, I-20156 Milan, Italy",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13837,Article,1476-4687,haewon.mcjeon@pnnl.gov,+,"BAEconomics; Global Technology Strategy Project; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research; Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research; Italian Ministry of Environment, Land and Sea under the GEMINA project","B.F. and R.M. and their development of BAEGEM were supported by BAEconomics with assistance for special applications to the resource sector from Rio Tinto (Australia).

65,234,374.0,"Quantum metrology(1) uses tools from quantum information science to improve measurement signal-to-noise ratios. The challenge is to increase sensitivity while reducing susceptibility to noise, tasks that are often in conflict. Lock-in measurement is a detection scheme designed to overcome this difficulty by spectrally separating signal from noise. Here we report on the implementation of a quantum analogue to the classical lock-in amplifier. All the lock-in operations-modulation, detection and mixing-are performed through the application of non-commuting quantum operators to the electronic spin state of a single, trapped Sr(+) ion. We significantly increase its sensitivity to external fields while extending phase coherence by three orders of magnitude, to more than one second. Using this technique, we measure frequency shifts with a sensitivity of 0.42 Hz Hz(-1/2) (corresponding to a magnetic field measurement sensitivity of 15 pT Hz(-1/2)), obtaining an uncertainty of less than 10 mHz (350 fT) after 3,720 seconds of averaging. These sensitivities are limited by quantum projection noise and improve on other single-spin probe technologies(2,3) by two orders of magnitude. Our reported sensitivity is sufficient for the measurement of parity non-conservation(4), as well as the detection of the magnetic field of a single electronic spin one micrometre from an ion detector with nanometre resolution. As a first application, we perform light shift spectroscopy of a narrow optical quadrupole transition. Finally, we emphasize that the quantum lock-in technique is generic and can potentially enhance the sensitivity of any quantum sensor.","Kotler, Shlomi; Akerman, Nitzan; Glickman, Yinnon; Keselman, Anna; Ozeri, Roee","Kotler, S; Akerman, N; Glickman, Y; Keselman, A; Ozeri, R",61.0,"[Kotler, Shlomi; Akerman, Nitzan; Glickman, Yinnon; Keselman, Anna; Ozeri, Roee] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Phys Complex Syst, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10010,Article,,shlomi.kotler@weizmann.ac.il,65,ISF; Crown Photonics Center; Minerva Foundation,"We thank G.

66,57,421.0,"Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death worldwide, with over one million cases annually(1). To identify genetic factors that modify disease risk, we conducted a genome- wide association study by analysing 317,139 single- nucleotide polymorphisms in 1,989 lung cancer cases and 2,625 controls from six central European countries. We identified a locus in chromosome region 15q25 that was strongly associated with lung cancer ( P= 9 x 10(-10)). This locus was replicated in five separate lung cancer studies comprising an additional 2,513 lung cancer cases and 4,752 controls ( P = 5 x 10(-20) overall), and it was found to account for 14%( attributable risk) of lung cancer cases. Statistically similar risks were observed irrespective of smoking status or propensity to smoke tobacco. The association region contains several genes, including three that encode nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits ( CHRNA5, CHRNA3 and CHRNB4). Such subunits are expressed in neurons and other tissues, in particular alveolar epithelial cells, pulmonary neuroendocrine cells and lung cancer cell lines(2,3), and they bind to N'- nitrosonornicotine and potential lung carcinogens(4). A non- synonymous variant of CHRNA5 that induces an amino acid substitution ( D398N) at a highly conserved site in the second intracellular loop of the protein is among the markers with the strongest disease associations. Our results provide compelling evidence of a locus at 15q25 predisposing to lung cancer, and reinforce interest in nicotinic acetylcholine receptors as potential disease candidates and chemopreventative targets(5).","Hung, Rayjean J.; Mckay, James D.; Gaborieau, Valerie; Boffetta, Paolo; Hashibe, Mia; Zaridze, David; Mukeria, Anush; Szeszenia-Dabrowska, Neonilia; Lissowska, Jolanta; Rudnai, Peter; Fabianova, Eleonora; Mates, Dana; Bencko, Vladimir; Foretova, Lenka; Janout, Vladimir; Chen, Chu; Goodman, Gary; Field, John K.; Liloglou, Triantafillos; Xinarianos, George; Cassidy, Adrian; McLaughlin, John; Liu, Geoffrey; Narod, Steven; Krokan, Hans E.; Skorpen, Frank; Elvestad, Maiken Bratt; Hveem, Kristian; Vatten, Lars; Linseisen, Jakob; Clavel-Chapelon, Francoise; Vineis, Paolo; Bueno-de-Mesquita, H.

67,122,159.0,"On 1 April 2014, Northern Chile was struck by a magnitude 8.1 earthquake following a protracted series of foreshocks. The Integrated Plate Boundary Observatory Chile monitored the entire sequence of events, providing unprecedented resolution of the build-up to the main event and its rupture evolution. Here we show that the Iquique earthquake broke a central fraction of the so-called northern Chile seismic gap, the last major segment of the South American plate boundary that had not ruptured in the past century(1,2). Since July 2013 three seismic clusters, each lasting a few weeks, hit this part of the plate boundary with earthquakes of increasing peak magnitudes. Starting with the second cluster, geodetic observations show surface displacements that can be associated with slip on the plate interface. These seismic clusters and their slip transients occupied a part of the plate interface that was transitional between a fully locked and a creeping portion. Leading up to this earthquake, the b value of the foreshocks gradually decreased during the years before the earthquake, reversing its trend a few days before the Iquique earthquake. The mainshock finally nucleated at the northern end of the foreshock area, which skirted a locked patch, and ruptured mainly downdip towards higher locking. Peak slip was attained immediately downdip of the foreshock region and at the margin of the locked patch. We conclude that gradual weakening of the central part of the seismic gap accentuated by the foreshock activity in a zone of intermediate seismic coupling was instrumental in causing final failure, distinguishing the Iquique earthquake from most great earthquakes. Finally, only one-third of the gap was broken and the remaining locked segments nowpose a significant, increased seismic hazard with the potential to host an earthquake with a magnitude of > 8.5.","Schurr, Bernd; Asch, Guenter; Hainzl, Sebastian; Bedford, Jonathan; Hoechner, Andreas; Palo, Mauro; Wang, Rongjiang; Moreno, Marcos; Bartsch, Mitja; Zhang, Yong; Oncken, Onno; Tilmann, Frederik; Dahm, Torsten; Victor, Pia; Barrientos, Sergio; Vilotte, Jean-Pierre","Schurr, B; Asch, G; Hainzl, S; Bedford, J; Hoechner, A; Palo, M; Wang, RJ; Moreno, M; Bartsch, M; Zhang, Y; Oncken, O; Tilmann, F; Dahm, T; Victor, P; Barrientos, S; Vilotte, JP",299.0,"[Schurr, Bernd; Asch, Guenter; Hainzl, Sebastian; Bedford, Jonathan; Hoechner, Andreas; Palo, Mauro; Wang, Rongjiang; Moreno, Marcos; Bartsch, Mitja; Oncken, Onno; Tilmann, Frederik; Dahm, Torsten; Victor, Pia] German Res Ctr Geosci, GFZ Helmholtz Ctr Potsdam, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Zhang, Yong] Peking Univ, Sch Earth & Space Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Barrientos, Sergio] Univ Chile, Ctr Sismol Natl, Fac Ciencias Fis & Matemat, Santiago 2002, Chile; [Vilotte, Jean-Pierre] Inst Phys Globe Paris, F-75238 Paris 05, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13681,Article,1476-4687,schurr@gfz-potsdam.de,+,GFZ; Hannover Re,"Data used in this study come from the IPOC initiative (http://www.ipoc-network.org) operated by the GFZ - German Research Centre for Geosciences, Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris, Centro Sismologico National, Universidad de Chile, and Universidad Catolica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile.

68,25,194.0,"Horizontal transfer (HT), or the passage of genetic material between non-mating species, is increasingly recognized as an important force in the evolution of eukaryotic genomes(1,2). Transposons, with their inherent ability to mobilize and amplify within genomes, may be especially prone to HT(3-7). However, the means by which transposons can spread across widely diverged species remain elusive. Here we present evidence that host-parasite interactions have promoted the HT of four transposon families between invertebrates and vertebrates. We found that Rhodnius prolixus, a triatomine bug feeding on the blood of various tetrapods and vector of Chagas' disease in humans, carries in its genome four distinct transposon families that also invaded the genomes of a diverse, but overlapping, set of tetrapods. The bug transposons are similar to 98% identical and cluster phylogenetically with those of the opossum and squirrel monkey, two of its preferred mammalian hosts in South America. We also identified one of these transposon families in the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis, a cosmopolitan vector of trematodes infecting diverse vertebrates, whose ancestral sequence is nearly identical and clusters with those found in Old World mammals. Together these data provide evidence for a previously hypothesized role of host-parasite interactions in facilitating HT among animals(3,7). Furthermore, the large amount of DNA generated by the amplification of the horizontally transferred transposons supports the idea that the exchange of genetic material between hosts and parasites influences their genomic evolution.","Gilbert, Clement; Schaack, Sarah; Pace, John K., II; Brindley, Paul J.; Feschotte, Cedric","Gilbert, C; Schaack, S; Pace, JK; Brindley, PJ; Feschotte, C",1347.0,"[Gilbert, Clement; Schaack, Sarah; Pace, John K., II; Feschotte, Cedric] Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Biol, Arlington, TX 76019 USA; [Brindley, Paul J.] George Washington Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Microbiol Immunol & Trop Med, Washington, DC 20037 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08939,Article,,cedric@uta.edu,U4,National Institutes of Health; National Science Foundation,"We thank E.

69,154,346.0,"Nucleic-acid-binding proteins are generally viewed as either specific or nonspecific, depending on characteristics of their binding sites in DNA or RNA(1,2). Most studies have focused on specific proteins, which identify cognate sites by binding with highest affinities to regions with defined signatures in sequence, structure or both(1-4). Proteins that bind to sites devoid of defined sequence or structure signatures are considered nonspecific(1,2,5). Substrate binding by these proteins is poorly understood, and it is not known to what extent seemingly nonspecific proteins discriminate between different binding sites, aside from those sequestered by nucleic acid structures(6). Here we systematically examine substrate binding by the apparently nonspecific RNA-binding protein C5, and find clear discrimination between different binding site variants. C5 is the protein subunit of the transfer RNA processing ribonucleoprotein enzyme RNase P from Escherichia coli. The protein binds 59 leaders of precursor tRNAs at a site without sequence or structure signatures. We measure functional binding of C5 to all possible sequence variants in its substrate binding site, using a high-throughput sequencing kinetics approach (HITS-KIN) that simultaneously follows processing of thousands of RNA species. C5 binds different substrate variants with affinities varying by orders of magnitude. The distribution of functional affinities of C5 for all substrate variants resembles affinity distributions of highly specific nucleic acid binding proteins. Unlike these specific proteins, C5 does not bind its physiological RNA targets with the highest affinity, but with affinities near the median of the distribution, a region that is not associated with a sequence signature. We delineate defined rules governing substrate recognition by C5, which reveal specificity that is hidden in cellular substrates for RNase P. Our findings suggest that apparently nonspecific and specific RNA-binding modes may not differ fundamentally, but represent distinct parts of common affinity distributions.","Guenther, Ulf-Peter; Yandek, Lindsay E.; Niland, Courtney N.; Campbell, Frank E.; Anderson, David; Anderson, Vernon E.; Harris, Michael E.; Jankowsky, Eckhard","Guenther, UP; Yandek, LE; Niland, CN; Campbell, FE; Anderson, D; Anderson, VE; Harris, ME; Jankowsky, E",385.0,"[Guenther, Ulf-Peter; Campbell, Frank E.; Jankowsky, Eckhard] Case Western Reserve Univ, Ctr RNA Mol Biol, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Guenther, Ulf-Peter; Yandek, Lindsay E.; Niland, Courtney N.; Anderson, Vernon E.; Harris, Michael E.; Jankowsky, Eckhard] Case Western Reserve Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Anderson, David] CUNY, Baruch Coll, Zicklin Sch Business, Dept Management, New York, NY 10010 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12543,Article,1476-4687,meh2@case.edu; exj13@case.edu,+,"US National Institutes of Health (NIH) [GM067700, GM099720, CSTA UL1RR024989, GM056740, GM096000, T32 GM008056]; DFG","We particularly thank T.

70,153,323.0,"The El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) drives substantial variability in rainfall(1-3), severe weather(4,5), agricultural production(3,6), ecosystems(7) and disease(8) in many parts of the world. Given that further human-forced changes in the Earth's climate system seem inevitable(9,10), the possibility exists that the character of ENSO and its impacts might change over the coming century. Although this issue has been investigated many times during the past 20 years, there is very little consensus on future changes in ENSO, apart from an expectation that ENSO will continue to be a dominant source of year-to-year variability(9,11,12). Here we show that there are in fact robust projected changes in the spatial patterns of year-to-year ENSO-driven variability in both surface temperature and precipitation. These changes are evident in the two most recent generations of climate models(13,14), using four different scenarios for CO2 and other radiatively active gases(14-17). By the mid- to late twenty-first century, the projections include an intensification of both El-Nino-driven drying in the western Pacific Ocean and rainfall increases in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific. Experiments with an Atmospheric General Circulation Model reveal that robust projected changes in precipitation anomalies during El Nino years are primarily determined by a nonlinear response to surface global warming. Uncertain projected changes in the amplitude of ENSO-driven surface temperature variability have only a secondary role. Projected changes in key characteristics of ENSO are consequently much clearer than previously realized.","Power, Scott; Delage, Francois; Chung, Christine; Kociuba, Greg; Keay, Kevin","Power, S; Delage, F; Chung, C; Kociuba, G; Keay, K",541.0,"[Power, Scott; Delage, Francois; Chung, Christine; Kociuba, Greg; Keay, Kevin] Bur Meteorol, Ctr Australian Weather & Climate Res, Melbourne, Vic 3008, Australia",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12580,Article,1476-4687,s.power@bom.gov.au,+,"Australian Climate Change Science Program (ACCSP); Pacific-Australia Climate Change Science and Adaptation planning Program (PACCSAP); AusAID; Department of Industry, Innovation, Climate Change, Science, Research and Tertiary Education","We thank L.

71,149,195.0,"Gut commensal microbes shape the mucosal immune system by regulating the differentiation and expansion of several types of T cell(1-5). Clostridia, a dominant class of commensal microbe, can induce colonic regulatory T (T-reg) cells, which have a central role in the suppression of inflammatory and allergic responses(3). However, the molecular mechanisms by which commensal microbes induce colonic T-reg cells have been unclear. Here we show that a large bowel microbial fermentation product, butyrate, induces the differentiation of colonic T-reg cells in mice. A comparative NMR-based metabolome analysis suggests that the luminal concentrations of short-chain fatty acids positively correlates with the number of T-reg cells in the colon. Among short-chain fatty acids, butyrate induced the differentiation of T-reg cells in vitro and in vivo, and ameliorated the development of colitis induced by adoptive transfer of CD4(+) CD45RB(hi) T cells in Rag1(-/-) mice. Treatment of naive T cells under the T-reg-cell-polarizing conditions with butyrate enhanced histone H3 acetylation in the promoter and conserved non-coding sequence regions of the Foxp3 locus, suggesting a possible mechanism for how microbial-derived butyrate regulates the differentiation of T-reg cells. Our findings provide new insight into the mechanisms by which host-microbe interactions establish immunological homeostasis in the gut.","Furusawa, Yukihiro; Obata, Yuuki; Fukuda, Shinji; Endo, Takaho A.; Nakato, Gaku; Takahashi, Daisuke; Nakanishi, Yumiko; Uetake, Chikako; Kato, Keiko; Kato, Tamotsu; Takahashi, Masumi; Fukuda, Noriko N.; Murakami, Shinnosuke; Miyauchi, Eiji; Hino, Shingo; Atarashi, Koji; Onawa, Satoshi; Fujimura, Yumiko; Lockett, Trevor; Clarke, Julie M.; Topping, David L.; Tomita, Masaru; Hori, Shohei; Ohara, Osamu; Morita, Tatsuya; Koseki, Haruhiko; Kikuchi, Jun; Honda, Kenya; Hase, Koji; Ohno, Hiroshi","Furusawa, Y; Obata, Y; Fukuda, S; Endo, TA; Nakato, G; Takahashi, D; Nakanishi, Y; Uetake, C; Kato, K; Kato, T; Takahashi, M; Fukuda, NN; Murakami, S; Miyauchi, E; Hino, S; Atarashi, K; Onawa, S; Fujimura, Y; Lockett, T; Clarke, JM; Topping, DL; Tomita, M; Hori, S; Ohara, O; Morita, T; Koseki, H; Kikuchi, J; Honda, K; Hase, K; Ohno, H",446.0,"[Furusawa, Yukihiro; Obata, Yuuki; Fukuda, Shinji; Endo, Takaho A.; Nakato, Gaku; Takahashi, Daisuke; Uetake, Chikako; Kato, Keiko; Kato, Tamotsu; Takahashi, Masumi; Miyauchi, Eiji; Atarashi, Koji; Onawa, Satoshi; Hori, Shohei; Ohara, Osamu; Koseki, Haruhiko; Honda, Kenya; Hase, Koji; Ohno, Hiroshi] RIKEN Ctr Integrat Med Sci IMS RCAI, Wako, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Furusawa, Yukihiro; Obata, Yuuki; Fujimura, Yumiko; Hase, Koji] Univ Tokyo, Inst Med Sci, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; [Obata, Yuuki; Koseki, Haruhiko; Ohno, Hiroshi] Chiba Univ, Grad Sch Med, Chiba 2608670, Japan; [Fukuda, Shinji; Nakanishi, Yumiko; Fukuda, Noriko N.; Murakami, Shinnosuke; Tomita, Masaru] Keio Univ, Inst Adv Biosci, Yamagata 9970052, Japan; [Kato, Keiko; Koseki, Haruhiko; Kikuchi, Jun] Yokohama City Univ, Grad Sch Med Life Sci, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Hino, Shingo] Shizuoka Univ, Fac Agr, Shizuoka 4228529, Japan; [Atarashi, Koji; Hase, Koji] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, PRESTO, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; [Lockett, Trevor; Clarke, Julie M.; Topping, David L.] CSIRO Food & Nutr Sci, Preventat Hlth Natl Res Flagship, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia; [Kikuchi, Jun] RIKEN Ctr Sustainable Resource Sci, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Honda, Kenya] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, CREST, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12721,Article,1476-4687,sfukuda@sfc.keio.ac.jp; hase@ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp; ohno@rcai.riken.jp,+,"Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology [24117524, 21022049, 20113003]; The Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [24890293, 252667, 24380072, 24658129, 22689017, 21390155]; The Japan Science and Technology Agency; RIKEN; RIKEN RCAI Young Chief Investigator program; Institute for Fermentation, Osaka; Mishima Kaiun Memorial Foundation; The Takeda Science Foundation; The Mitsubishi Foundation; The Uehara Memorial Foundation","We would like to thank P.

72,132,375.0,"Electromagnetic noise is emitted everywhere humans use electronic devices. For decades, it has been hotly debated whether man-made electric and magnetic fields affect biological processes, including human health(1-5). So far, no putative effect of anthropogenic electromagnetic noise at intensities below the guidelines adopted by the World Health Organization(1,2) has withstood the test of independent replication under truly blinded experimental conditions. No effect has therefore been widely accepted as scientifically proven(1-6). Here we show that migratory birds are unable to use their magnetic compass in the presence of urban electromagnetic noise. When European robins, Erithacus rubecula, were exposed to the background electromagnetic noise present in unscreened wooden huts at the University of Oldenburg campus, they could not orient using their magnetic compass. Their magnetic orientation capabilities reappeared inelectrically grounded, aluminium-screened huts, which attenuated electromagnetic noise in the frequency range from 50 kHz to 5 MHz by approximately two orders of magnitude. When the grounding was removed or when broadband electromagnetic noise was deliberately generated inside the screened and grounded huts, the birds again lost their magnetic orientation capabilities. The disruptive effect of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields is not confined to a narrow frequency band and birds tested far from sources of electromagnetic noise required no screening to orient with their magnetic compass. These fully double-blinded tests document a reproducible effect of anthropogenic electromagnetic noise on the behaviour of an intact vertebrate.","Engels, Svenja; Schneider, Nils-Lasse; Lefeldt, Nele; Hein, Christine Maira; Zapka, Manuela; Michalik, Andreas; Elbers, Dana; Kittel, Achim; Hore, P.

73,223,36.0,"The exchange of the oocyte's genome with the genome of a somatic cell, followed by the derivation of pluripotent stem cells, could enable the generation of specific cells affected in degenerative human diseases. Such cells, carrying the patient's genome, might be useful for cell replacement. Here we report that the development of human oocytes after genome exchange arrests at late cleavage stages in association with transcriptional abnormalities. In contrast, if the oocyte genome is not removed and the somatic cell genome is merely added, the resultant triploid cells develop to the blastocyst stage. Stem cell lines derived from these blastocysts differentiate into cell types of all three germ layers, and a pluripotent gene expression program is established on the genome derived from the somatic cell. This result demonstrates the feasibility of reprogramming human cells using oocytes and identifies removal of the oocyte genome as the primary cause of developmental failure after genome exchange.","Noggle, Scott; Fung, Ho-Lim; Gore, Athurva; Martinez, Hector; Satriani, Kathleen Crumm; Prosser, Robert; Oum, Kiboong; Paull, Daniel; Druckenmiller, Sarah; Freeby, Matthew; Greenberg, Ellen; Zhang, Kun; Goland, Robin; Sauer, Mark V.; Leibel, Rudolph L.; Egli, Dieter","Noggle, S; Fung, HL; Gore, A; Martinez, H; Satriani, KC; Prosser, R; Oum, K; Paull, D; Druckenmiller, S; Freeby, M; Greenberg, E; Zhang, K; Goland, R; Sauer, MV; Leibel, RL; Egli, D",70.0,"[Noggle, Scott; Martinez, Hector; Paull, Daniel; Druckenmiller, Sarah; Egli, Dieter] New York Stem Cell Fdn Lab, New York, NY USA; [Fung, Ho-Lim; Gore, Athurva; Zhang, Kun] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Bioengn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Satriani, Kathleen Crumm; Prosser, Robert; Oum, Kiboong; Sauer, Mark V.] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Ctr Womens Reprod Care, New York, NY USA; [Satriani, Kathleen Crumm; Prosser, Robert; Oum, Kiboong; Sauer, Mark V.] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, New York, NY USA; [Freeby, Matthew; Greenberg, Ellen; Goland, Robin; Leibel, Rudolph L.] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Naomi Berrie Diabet Ctr, New York, NY USA; [Freeby, Matthew; Greenberg, Ellen; Goland, Robin; Leibel, Rudolph L.] Columbia Univ, Dept Pediat, Coll Phys & Surg, New York, NY 10027 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10397,Article,1476-4687,d.egli@nyscf.org,U81,UCSD; New York Stem Cell Foundation; Russell Berrie Foundation,"We thank our research subjects for participating.

74,26,237.0,"Most archaeal groups and deeply branching bacterial lineages harbour thermophilic organisms with a chemolithoautotrophic metabolism. They live at high temperatures in volcanic habitats at the expense of inorganic substances, often under anoxic conditions(1). These autotrophic organisms use diverse carbon dioxide fixation mechanisms generating acetyl-coenzyme A, from which gluconeogenesis must start(2-4). Here we show that virtually all archaeal groups as well as the deeply branching bacterial lineages contain a bifunctional fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) aldolase/phosphatase with both FBP aldolase and FBP phosphatase activity. This enzyme is missing inmost other Bacteria and in Eukaryota, and is heat-stabile even in mesophilic marine Crenarchaeota. Its bifunctionality ensures that heat-labile triosephosphates are quickly removed and trapped in stabile fructose 6-phosphate, rendering gluconeogenesis unidirectional. We propose that this highly conserved, heat-stabile and bifunctional FBP aldolase/phosphatase represents the pacemaking ancestral gluconeogenic enzyme, and that in evolution gluconeogenesis preceded glycolysis(5).","Say, Rafael F.; Fuchs, Georg","Say, RF; Fuchs, G",1077.0,"[Say, Rafael F.; Fuchs, Georg] Univ Freiburg, Fak Biol, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08884,Article,1476-4687,georg.fuchs@biologie.uni-freiburg.de,U156,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Evonik-Degussa,"We thank R.

75,152,276.0,"Many animals, including insects, are known to use visual landmarks to orient in their environment. In Drosophila melanogaster, behavioural genetics studies have identified a higher brain structure called the central complex as being required for the fly's innate responses to vertical visual features(1) and its short-and long-term memory for visual patterns(2-4). But whether and how neurons of the fly central complex represent visual features are unknown. Here we use two-photon calcium imaging in head-fixed walking and flying flies to probe visuomotor responses of ring neurons-a class of central complex neurons that have been implicated in landmark-driven spatial memory in walking flies(2,3) and memory for visual patterns in tethered flying flies(5). We show that dendrites of ring neurons are visually responsive and arranged retinotopically. Ring neuron receptive fields comprise both excitatory and inhibitory subfields, resembling those of simple cells in the mammalian primary visual cortex. Ring neurons show strong and, in some cases, direction-selective orientation tuning, with a notable preference for vertically oriented features similar to those that evoke innate responses in flies(1,2). Visual responses were diminished during flight, but, in contrast with the hypothesized role of the central complex in the control of locomotion(6), not modulated during walking. Taken together, these results indicate that ring neurons represent behaviourally relevant visual features in the fly's environment, enabling downstream central complex circuits to produce appropriate motor commands(6). More broadly, this study opens the door to mechanistic investigations of circuit computations underlying visually guided action selection in the Drosophila central complex.","Seelig, Johannes D.; Jayaraman, Vivek","Seelig, JD; Jayaraman, V",262.0,"[Seelig, Johannes D.; Jayaraman, Vivek] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12601,Article,1476-4687,vivek@janelia.hhmi.org,+,Howard Hughes Medical Institute,"We thank A.

76,195,361.0,"A Luttinger liquid is an interacting one-dimensional electronic system, quite distinct from the 'conventional' Fermi liquids formed by interacting electrons in two and three dimensions(1). Some of the most striking properties of Luttinger liquids are revealed in the process of electron tunnelling. For example, as a function of the applied bias voltage or temperature, the tunnelling current exhibits a non-trivial power-law suppression(2,3). (There is no such suppression in a conventional Fermi liquid.) Here, using a carbon nanotube connected to resistive leads, we create a system that emulates tunnelling in a Luttinger liquid, by controlling the interaction of the tunnelling electron with its environment. We further replace a single tunnelling barrier with a double-barrier, resonant-level structure and investigate resonant tunnelling between Luttinger liquids. At low temperatures, we observe perfect transparency of the resonant level embedded in the interacting environment, and the width of the resonance tends to zero. We argue that this behaviour results from many-body physics of interacting electrons, and signals the presence of a quantum phase transition(4,5). Given that many parameters, including the interaction strength, can be precisely controlled in our samples, this is an attractive model system for studying quantum critical phenomena in general, with wide-reaching implications for understanding quantum phase transitions in more complex systems, such as cold atoms(6) and strongly correlated bulk materials(7).","Mebrahtu, Henok T.; Borzenets, Ivan V.; Liu, Dong E.; Zheng, Huaixiu; Bomze, Yuriy V.; Smirnov, Alex I.; Baranger, Harold U.; Finkelstein, Gleb","Mebrahtu, HT; Borzenets, IV; Liu, DE; Zheng, HX; Bomze, YV; Smirnov, AI; Baranger, HU; Finkelstein, G",61.0,"[Mebrahtu, Henok T.; Borzenets, Ivan V.; Liu, Dong E.; Zheng, Huaixiu; Bomze, Yuriy V.; Baranger, Harold U.; Finkelstein, Gleb] Duke Univ, Dept Phys, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Smirnov, Alex I.] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Chem, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11265,Article,,gleb@phy.duke.edu,64,"US DOE [DE-SC0002765, DE-SC0005237, DE-FG02-02ER15354]","We appreciate discussions with I.

77,174,277.0,"Recently observed extreme temperatures at high northern latitudes(1-7) are rare by definition, making the longer time span afforded by climate proxies important for assessing how the frequency of such extremes may be changing. Previous reconstructions of past temperature variability have demonstrated that recent warmth is anomalous relative to preceding centuries(2,8,9) or millennia(10), but extreme events can be more thoroughly evaluated using a spatially resolved approach that provides an ensemble of possible temperature histories(11,12). Here, using a hierarchical Bayesian analysis(13,14) of instrumental, tree-ring, ice-core and lake-sediment records, we show that the magnitude and frequency of recent warm temperature extremes at high northern latitudes are unprecedented in the past 600 years. The summers of 2005, 2007, 2010 and 2011 were warmer than those of all prior years back to 1400 (probability P > 0.95), in terms of the spatial average. The summer of 2010 was the warmest in the previous 600 years in western Russia (P > 0.99) and probably the warmest in western Greenland and the Canadian Arctic as well (P > 0.90). These and other recent extremes greatly exceed those expected from a stationary climate, but can be understood as resulting from constant space-time variability about an increased mean temperature.","Tingley, Martin P.; Huybers, Peter","Tingley, MP; Huybers, P",201.0,"[Tingley, Martin P.; Huybers, Peter] Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11969,Article,,tingley@fas.harvard.edu,+,FAS Science Division Research Computing Group at Harvard University; NSF [ATM-0902374],"Data analysis was performed on the Odyssey cluster supported by the FAS Science Division Research Computing Group at Harvard University.

78,144,77.0,"Earth system models project that the tropical land carbon sink will decrease in size in response to an increase in warming and drought during this century, probably causing a positive climate feedback(1,2). But available data(3-5) are too limited at present to test the predicted changes in the tropical carbon balance in response to climate change. Long-term atmospheric carbon dioxide data provide a global record that integrates the interannual variability of the global carbon balance. Multiple lines of evidence(6-8) demonstrate that most of this variability originates in the terrestrial biosphere. In particular, the year-to-year variations in the atmospheric carbon dioxide growth rate (CGR) are thought to be the result of fluctuations in the carbon fluxes of tropical land areas(6,9,10). Recently, the response of CGR to tropical climate interannual variability was used to put a constraint on the sensitivity of tropical land carbon to climate change(10). Here we use the long-term CGR record from Mauna Loa and the South Pole to show that the sensitivity of CGR to tropical temperature interannual variability has increased by a factor of 1.9 +/- 0.3 in the past five decades. We find that this sensitivity was greater when tropical land regions experienced drier conditions. This suggests that the sensitivity of CGR to interannual temperature variations is regulated by moisture conditions, even though the direct correlation between CGR and tropical precipitation is weak(9). We also find that present terrestrial carbon cycle models do not capture the observed enhancement in CGR sensitivity in the past five decades. More realistic model predictions of future carbon cycle and climate feedbacks require a better understanding of the processes driving the response of tropical ecosystems to drought and warming.","Wang, Xuhui; Piao, Shilong; Ciais, Philippe; Friedlingstein, Pierre; Myneni, Ranga B.; Cox, Peter; Heimann, Martin; Miller, John; Peng, Shushi; Wang, Tao; Yang, Hui; Chen, Anping","Wang, XH; Piao, SL; Ciais, P; Friedlingstein, P; Myneni, RB; Cox, P; Heimann, M; Miller, J; Peng, SS; Wang, T; Yang, H; Chen, AP",212.0,"[Wang, Xuhui; Piao, Shilong; Ciais, Philippe; Peng, Shushi; Wang, Tao; Yang, Hui] Peking Univ, Sinofrench Inst Earth Syst Sci, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Piao, Shilong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China; [Ciais, Philippe; Wang, Tao] CEA CNRS UVSQ, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Friedlingstein, Pierre; Cox, Peter] Univ Exeter, Coll Engn Math & Phys Sci, Exeter EX4 4QF, Devon, England; [Myneni, Ranga B.] Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Heimann, Martin] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07701 Jena, Germany; [Miller, John] NOAA, Global Monitoring Div, Earth Syst Res Lab, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; [Miller, John] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Chen, Anping] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12915,Article,1476-4687,slpiao@pku.edu.cn,+,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [41125004]; National Basic Research Program of China [2010CB950601, 2013CB956303]; National Youth Top-notch Talent Support Program in China; NASA Earth Science Division","We thank S.

79,136,423.0,"The initiation of plate tectonics on Earth is a critical event in our planet's history. The time lag between the first proto-subduction (about 4 billion years ago) and global tectonics (approximately 3 billion years ago) suggests that plates and plate boundaries became widespread over a period of 1 billion years. The reason for this time lag is unknown but fundamental to understanding the origin of plate tectonics. Here we suggest that when sufficient lithospheric damage (which promotes shear localization and long-lived weak zones) combines with transient mantle flow and migrating proto-subduction, it leads to the accumulation of weak plate boundaries and eventually to fully formed tectonic plates driven by subduction alone. We simulate this process using a grain evolution and damage mechanism with a composite rheology (which is compatible with field and laboratory observations of polycrystalline rocks(1,2)), coupled to an idealized model of pressure-driven lithospheric flow in which a low-pressure zone is equivalent to the suction of convective downwellings. In the simplest case, for Earth-like conditions, a few successive rotations of the driving pressure field yield relic damaged weak zones that are inherited by the lithospheric flow to forma nearly perfect plate, with passive spreading and strike-slip margins that persist and localize further, even though flow is driven only by subduction. But for hotter surface conditions, such as those on Venus, accumulation and inheritance of damage is negligible; hence only subduction zones survive and plate tectonics does not spread, which corresponds to observations. After plates have developed, continued changes in driving forces, combined with inherited damage and weak zones, promote increased tectonic complexity, such as oblique subduction, strike-slip boundaries that are subparallel to plate motion, and spalling of minor plates.","Bercovici, David; Ricard, Yanick","Bercovici, D; Ricard, Y",513.0,"[Bercovici, David] Yale Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Ricard, Yanick] Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, ENS Lyon, Lab Geol Lyon, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13072,Article,1476-4687,david.bercovici@yale.edu,+,National Science Foundation; Agence Nationale de la Recherche,"D.

80,59,52.0,"The future paths of population ageing result from specific combinations of declining fertility and increasing life expectancies in different parts of the world(1). Here we measure the speed of population ageing by using conventional measures and new ones that take changes in longevity into account for the world as a whole and for 13 major regions. We report on future levels of indicators of ageing and the speed at which they change. We show how these depend on whether changes in life expectancy are taken into account. We also show that the speed of ageing is likely to increase over the coming decades and to decelerate in most regions by mid-century. All our measures indicate a continuous ageing of the world's population throughout the century. The median age of the world's population increases from 26.6 years in 2000 to 37.3 years in 2050 and then to 45.6 years in 2100, when it is not adjusted for longevity increase. When increases in life expectancy are taken into account(2,3), the adjusted median age rises from 26.6 in 2000 to 31.1 in 2050 and only to 32.9 in 2100, slightly less than what it was in the China region in 2005. There are large differences in the regional patterns of ageing. In North America, the median age adjusted for life expectancy change falls throughout almost the entire century, whereas the conventional median age increases significantly. Our assessment of trends in ageing is based on new probabilistic population forecasts. The probability that growth in the world's population will end during this century is 88%, somewhat higher than previously assessed(4). After mid- century, lower rates of population growth are likely to coincide with slower rates of ageing.","Lutz, Wolfgang; Sanderson, Warren; Scherbov, Sergei","Lutz, W; Sanderson, W; Scherbov, S",716.0,"[Lutz, Wolfgang; Sanderson, Warren; Scherbov, Sergei] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, World Populat Program, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Lutz, Wolfgang; Scherbov, Sergei] Austrian Acad Sci, Vienna Inst Demog, A-1040 Vienna, Austria; [Sanderson, Warren] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Econ, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Sanderson, Warren] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Hist, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06516,Article,,lutz@iiasa.ac.at,719,,,259HD,Y,N,LIFE EXPECTANCY; DEMOGRAPHY; MORTALITY; LIMITS,7179.0,NATURE,Nature,English,19.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",7-Feb,4.0,LONDON,18204438.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,,"Lutz, W (reprint author), Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, World Populat Program, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,392.0,The coming acceleration of global population ageing,7.0,92.0,WOS:000252929500041,52.0,451.0,Multidisciplinary Sciences,403.0,sergei,scherbov,4961.0,38.0,male,0.97,qxDURIsAAAAJ,3.0,"(4126, 9345]",41324581,1,41324581,1

82,138,459.0,"Recognition of modified histones by 'reader' proteins plays a critical role in the regulation of chromatin(1). H3K36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) is deposited onto the nucleosomes in the transcribed regions after RNA polymerase II elongation. In yeast, this mark in turn recruits epigenetic regulators to reset the chromatin to a relatively repressive state, thus suppressing cryptic transcription(2). However, much less is known about the role of H3K36me3 in transcription regulation in mammals. This is further complicated by the transcription-coupled incorporation of the histone variant H3.3 in gene bodies(3). Here we show that the candidate tumour suppressor ZMYND11 specifically recognizes H3K36me3 on H3.3 (H3.3K36me3) and regulates RNA polymerase II elongation. Structural studies show that in addition to the trimethyl-lysine binding by an aromatic cage within the PWWP domain, the H3.3-dependent recognition is mediated by the encapsulation of the H3.3-specific 'Ser 31' residue in a composite pocket formed by the tandem bromo-PWWP domains of ZMYND11. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing shows a genome-wide co-localization of ZMYND11 with H3K36me3 and H3.3 in gene bodies, and its occupancy requires the pre-deposition of H3.3K36me3. Although ZMYND11 is associated with highly expressed genes, it functions as an unconventional transcription corepressor by modulating RNA polymerase II at the elongation stage. ZMYND11 is critical for the repression of a transcriptional program that is essential for tumour cell growth; low expression levels of ZMYND11 in breast cancer patients correlate with worse prognosis. Consistently, overexpression of ZMYND11 suppresses cancer cell growth in vitro and tumour formation in mice. Together, this study identifies ZMYND11 as an H3.3-specific reader of H3K36me3 that links the histone-variant-mediated transcription elongation control to tumour suppression.","Wen, Hong; Li, Yuanyuan; Xi, Yuanxin; Jiang, Shiming; Stratton, Sabrina; Peng, Danni; Tanaka, Kaori; Ren, Yongfeng; Xia, Zheng; Wu, Jun; Li, Bing; Barton, Michelle C.; Li, Wei; Li, Haitao; Shi, Xiaobing","Wen, H; Li, YY; Xi, YX; Jiang, SM; Stratton, S; Peng, DN; Tanaka, K; Ren, YF; Xia, Z; Wu, J; Li, B; Barton, MC; Li, W; Li, HT; Shi, XB",263.0,"[Wen, Hong; Jiang, Shiming; Stratton, Sabrina; Peng, Danni; Tanaka, Kaori; Barton, Michelle C.; Shi, Xiaobing] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Wen, Hong; Barton, Michelle C.; Shi, Xiaobing] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Ctr Canc Epigenet, Ctr Genet & Genom, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Wen, Hong; Barton, Michelle C.; Shi, Xiaobing] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Ctr Stem Cell & Dev Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Li, Yuanyuan; Ren, Yongfeng; Li, Haitao] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Life Sci, Struct Biol Ctr, MOE Key Lab Prot Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Li, Yuanyuan; Ren, Yongfeng; Li, Haitao] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Med, Dept Basic Med Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Xi, Yuanxin; Xia, Zheng; Li, Wei] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Dan L Duncan Canc Ctr, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Wu, Jun; Li, Bing] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Mol Biol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Barton, Michelle C.; Shi, Xiaobing] Univ Texas Houston, Grad Sch Biomed Sci, Genes & Dev Grad Program, Houston, TX 77030 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13045,Article,1476-4687,hwen@mdanderson.org; WL1@bcm.edu; lht@tsinghua.edu.cn; xbshi@mdanderson.org,+,American Cancer Society [RSG-13-290-01-TBE]; National institutes of Health (NIH)/MDACC [CCSG CA016672]; Major State Basic Research Development Program in China [2011CB965300]; Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2012M510413]; Kimmel Scholar Award;  [CPRITRP110471];  [Welch G1719];  [NIH R01HG007538];  [NIH R01GM090077];  [Welch I1713],"We thank J.

83,1,24.0,"Volcanic tremor is a ubiquitous feature of explosive eruptions. This oscillation persists for minutes to weeks and is characterized by a remarkably narrow band of frequencies from about 0.5 Hz to 7 Hz (refs 1-4). Before major eruptions, tremor can occur in concert with increased gas flux and related ground deformation(5-7). Volcanic tremor is thus of particular value for eruption forecasting(6,8). Most models for volcanic tremor rely on specific properties of the geometry, structure and constitution of volcanic conduits as well as the gas content of the erupting magma. Because neither the initial structure nor the evolution of the magma-conduit system will be the same from one volcano to the next, it is surprising that tremor characteristics are so consistent among different volcanoes. Indeed, this universality of tremor properties remains a major enigma. Here we employ the contemporary view that silicic magma rises in the conduit as a columnar plug surrounded by a highly vesicular annulus of sheared bubbles(9,10). We demonstrate that, for most geologically relevant conditions, the magma column will oscillate or 'wag' against the restoring 'gas-spring' force of the annulus at observed tremor frequencies. In contrast to previous models, the magma-wagging oscillation is relatively insensitive to the conduit structure and geometry, which explains the narrow band of tremor frequencies observed around the world. Moreover, the model predicts that as an eruption proceeds there will be an upward drift in both the maximum frequency and the total signal frequency bandwidth, the nature of which depends on the explosivity of the eruption, as is often observed.","Jellinek, A.

84,107,319.0,"Tissue morphogenesis is orchestrated by cell shape changes. Forces required to power these changes are generated by non-muscle myosin II (MyoII) motor proteins pulling filamentous actin (F-actin). Actomyosin networks undergo cycles of assembly and disassembly (pulses)(1,2) to cause cell deformations alternating with steps of stabilization to result in irreversible shape changes(3-6). Although this ratchet-like behaviour operates in a variety of contexts, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we investigate the role of MyoII regulation through the conserved Rho1-Rok pathway(7) during Drosophila melanogaster germband extension. This morphogenetic process is powered by cell intercalation, which involves the shrinkage of junctions in the dorsal-ventral axis (vertical junctions) followed by junction extension in the anterior-posterior axis(8). While polarized flows of medial-apical MyoII pulses deform vertical junctions, MyoII enrichment on these junctions (planar polarity) stabilizes them(6). We identify two critical properties of MyoII dynamics that underlie stability and pulsatility: exchange kinetics governed by phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycles of the MyoII regulatory light chain; and advection due to contraction of the motors on F-actin networks. Spatial control over MyoII exchange kinetics establishes two stable regimes of high and low dissociation rates, resulting in MyoII planar polarity. Pulsatility emerges at intermediate dissociation rates, enabling convergent advection of MyoII and its upstream regulators Rho1 GTP, Rok and MyoII phosphatase. Notably, pulsatility is not an outcome of an upstream Rho1 pacemaker. Rather, it is a self-organized system that involves positive and negative biomechanical feedback between MyoII advection and dissociation rates.","Munjal, Akankshi; Philippe, Jean-Marc; Munro, Edwin; Lecuit, Thomas","Munjal, A; Philippe, JM; Munro, E; Lecuit, T",351.0,"[Munjal, Akankshi; Philippe, Jean-Marc; Lecuit, Thomas] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, IBDM UMR7288, F-13009 Marseille, France; [Munro, Edwin] Univ Chicago, Dept Mol Genet & Cell Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14603,Article,1476-4687,thomas.lecuit@univ-amu.fr,+,Labex INFORM [ANR-11-LABX-0054]; ANR Archiplast; ERC (Biomecamorph) [323027]; HFSP; Ministere de l'Education nationale; Association pour la Recherche contre le Cancer (ARC); France-BioImaging/PICsL infrastructure [ANR-10-INSB-04-01],"We thank M.

85,203,101.0,"The development and maintenance of an epithelium requires finely balanced rates of growth and cell death. However, the mechanical and biochemical mechanisms that ensure proper feedback control of tissue growth(1-4), which when deregulated contribute to tumorigenesis, are poorly understood. Here we use the fly notum as a model system(5) to identify a novel process of crowding-induced cell delamination that balances growth to ensure the development of well-ordered cell packing. In crowded regions of the tissue, a proportion of cells undergo a serial loss of cell-cell junctions and a progressive loss of apical area, before being squeezed out by their neighbours. This path of delamination is recapitulated by a simple computational model of epithelial mechanics, in which stochastic cell loss relieves overcrowding as the system tends towards equilibrium. We show that this process of delamination is mechanistically distinct from apoptosis-mediated cell extrusion(6-8) and precedes the first signs of cell death. Overall, this analysis reveals a simple mechanism that buffers epithelia against variations in growth. Because live-cell delamination constitutes a mechanistic link between epithelial hyperplasia and cell invasion, this is likely to have important implications for our understanding of the early stages of cancer development.","Marinari, Eliana; Mehonic, Aida; Curran, Scott; Gale, Jonathan; Duke, Thomas; Baum, Buzz","Marinari, E; Mehonic, A; Curran, S; Gale, J; Duke, T; Baum, B",542.0,"[Marinari, Eliana; Curran, Scott; Baum, Buzz] UCL, MRC, Mol Cell Biol Lab, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Mehonic, Aida; Duke, Thomas] UCL, London Ctr Nanotechnol, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Mehonic, Aida; Duke, Thomas] UCL, Dept Phys & Astron, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Gale, Jonathan] UCL, UCL Ear Inst, London WC1X 8EE, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10984,Article,,b.baum@ucl.ac.uk,U177,"Cancer Research UK; University College London, Wellcome and the Royal Society","We thank J.

Although it is now accepted that the central nervous system undergoes constant immune surveillance that takes place within the meningeal compartment(1-3), the mechanisms governing the entrance and exit of immune cells from the central nervous system remain poorly understood(4-6). In searching for T-cell gateways into and out of the meninges, we discovered functional lymphatic vessels lining the dural sinuses. These structures express all of the molecular hallmarks of lymphatic endothelial cells, are able to carry both fluid and immune cells from the cerebrospinal fluid, and are connected to the deep cervical lymph nodes. The unique location of these vessels may have impeded their discovery to date, thereby contributing to the long-held concept of the absence of lymphatic vasculature in the central nervous system. The discovery of the central nervous system lymphatic system may call for a reassessment of basic assumptions in neuroimmunology and sheds new light on the aetiology of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases associated with immune system dysfunction.","Louveau, Antoine; Smirnov, Igor; Keyes, Timothy J.; Eccles, Jacob D.; Rouhani, Sherin J.; Peske, J.

87,64,192.0,"The origin and evolution of the Moon remain controversial(1,2), with one of the most important questions for lunar evolution being the timing and duration of basaltic ( mare) magmatism(1,3-8). Here we report the result of ion microprobe U - Pb dating of phosphates in a lunar meteorite, Kalahari 009, which is classified as a very- low- Ti mare- basalt breccia. In situ analyses of five phosphate grains, associated with basaltic clasts, give an age of 4.35+/-0.15 billion years. These ancient phosphate ages are thought to represent the crystallization ages of parental basalt magma, making Kalahari 009 one of the oldest known mare basalts. We suggest that mare basalt volcanism on the Moon started as early as 4.35 Gyr ago, relatively soon after its formation and differentiation, and preceding the bulk of lunar volcanism which ensued after the late heavy bombardment around 3.8- 3.9 Gyr ( refs 7 and 8). Considering the extremely low abundances of incompatible elements such as thorium and the rare earth elements in Kalahari 009 ( ref. 9) and recent remote- sensing observations illustrating that the cryptomaria tend to be of very- low- Ti basalt type(10-12), we conclude that Kalahari 009 is our first sample of a very- low- Ti cryptomare from the Moon.","Terada, Kentaro; Anand, Mahesh; Sokol, Anna K.; Bischoff, Addi; Sano, Yuji","Terada, K; Anand, M; Sokol, AK; Bischoff, A; Sano, Y",849.0,"Hiroshima Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Syst Sci, Higashihiroshima 7398526, Japan; Open Univ, CEPSAR, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England; Nat Hist Museum, Dept Mineral, London SW7 5BD, England; Inst Planetol, D-48149 Munster, Germany; Univ Tokyo, Ocean Res Inst, Ctr Adv Marine Res, Nakano Ku, Tokyo 1648639, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06356,Article,1476-4687,terada@sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp; M.Anand@open.ac.uk,U14,,,237RU,,,MARE-BASALT METEORITE; VOLCANISM; EVOLUTION; PETROGENESIS; GEOCHEMISTRY; STRATIGRAPHY,7171.0,NATURE,Nature,English,31.0,No,"Anand, Mahesh/0000-0003-4026-4476","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",6-Dec,5.0,LONDON,18064006.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007.0,"Anand, Mahesh/E-9259-2013","Terada, K (reprint author), Hiroshima Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Syst Sci, Higashihiroshima 7398526, Japan.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,54.0,Cryptomare magmatism 4.35 Gyr ago recorded in lunar meteorite Kalahari 009,0.0,12.0,WOS:000251394900049,192.0,450.0,Multidisciplinary Sciences,57.0,yuji,sano,8788.0,24.0,male,0.96,Twuf0N4AAAAJ,3.0,"(4126, 9345]",na,0,na,0
88,96,156.0,"Neuroblastoma is a malignant paediatric tumour of the sympathetic nervous system(1). Roughly half of these tumours regress spontaneously or are cured by limited therapy. By contrast, high-risk neuroblastomas have an unfavourable clinical course despite intensive multimodal treatment, and their molecular basis has remained largely elusive(2-4). Here we have performed whole-genome sequencing of 56 neuroblastomas (high-risk, n = 39; low-risk, n = 17) and discovered recurrent genomic rearrangements affecting a chromosomal region at 5p15.33 proximal of the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (TERT). These rearrangements occurred only in high-risk neuroblastomas (12/39, 31%) in a mutually exclusive fashion with MYCN amplifications and ATRX mutations, which are known genetic events in this tumour type(1,2,5). In an extended case series (n = 217), TERT rearrangements defined a subgroup of high-risk tumours with particularly poor outcome. Despite a large structural diversity of these rearrangements, they all induced massive transcriptional upregulation of TERT. In the remaining high-risk tumours, TERT expression was also elevated in MYCN-amplified tumours, whereas alternative lengthening of telomeres was present in neuroblastomas without TERT or MYCN alterations, suggesting that telomere lengthening represents a central mechanism defining this subtype. The 5p15.33 rearrangements juxtapose the TERT coding sequence to strong enhancer elements, resulting in massive chromatin remodelling and DNA methylation of the affected region. Supporting a functional role of TERT, neuroblastoma cell lines bearing rearrangements or amplified MYCN exhibited both upregulated TERT expression and enzymatic telomerase activity. In summary, our findings show that remodelling of the genomic context abrogates transcriptional silencing of TERT in high-risk neuroblastoma and places telomerase activation in the centre of transformation in a large fraction of these tumours.","Peifer, Martin;

89,141,20.0,"The life cycles of many parasites involve transitions between disparate host species, requiring these parasites to go through multiple developmental stages adapted to each of these specialized niches. Transmission of malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.) from humans to the mosquito vector requires differentiation from asexual stages replicating within red blood cells into non-dividing male and female gametocytes. Although gametocytes were first described in 1880, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in commitment to gametocyte formation is extremely limited, and disrupting this critical developmental transition remains a long-standing goal(1). Here we show that expression levels of the DNA-binding protein PfAP2-G correlate strongly with levels of gametocyte formation. Using independent forward and reverse genetics approaches, we demonstrate that PfAP2-G function is essential for parasite sexual differentiation. By combining genome-wide PfAP2-G cognate motif occurrence with global transcriptional changes resulting from PfAP2-G ablation, we identify early gametocyte genes as probable targets of PfAP2-G and show that their regulation by PfAP2-G is critical for their wild-type level expression. In the asexual blood-stage parasites pfap2-g appears to be among a set of epigenetically silenced loci(2,3) prone to spontaneous activation(4). Stochastic activation presents a simple mechanism for a low baseline of gametocyte production. Overall, these findings identify PfAP2-G as a master regulator of sexual-stage development in malaria parasites and mark the first discovery of a transcriptional switch controlling a differentiation decision in protozoan parasites.","Kafsack, Bjoern F.

90,161,475.0,"Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved catabolic process involved in several physiological and pathological processes(1,2). Although primarily cytoprotective, autophagy can also contribute to cell death; it is thus important to understand what distinguishes the life or death decision in autophagic cells(3). Here we report that induction of autophagy is coupled to reduction of histone H4 lysine 16 acetylation (H4K16ac) through downregulation of the histone acetyltransferase hMOF (also called KAT8 or MYST1), and demonstrate that this histone modification regulates the outcome of autophagy. At a genome-wide level, we find that H4K16 deacetylation is associated predominantly with the downregulation of autophagy-related genes. Antagonizing H4K16ac downregulation upon autophagy induction results in the promotion of cell death.

91,76,497.0,"Extant jawed vertebrates, or gnathostomes, fall into two major monophyletic groups, namely chondrichthyans (cartilaginous fishes) and osteichthyans (bony fishes and tetrapods). Fossil representatives of the osteichthyan crown group are known from the latest Silurian period, 418 million years (Myr) ago, to the present. By contrast, stem chondrichthyans and stem osteichthyans are still largely unknown. Two extinct Palaeozoic groups, the acanthodians and placoderms, may fall into these stem groups or the common stem group of gnathostomes, but their relationships and monophyletic status are both debated. Here we report unambiguous evidence for osteichthyan characters in jaw bones referred to the late Silurian (423-416-Myr-old) fishes Andreolepis hedei and Lophosteus superbus, long known from isolated bone fragments, scales and teeth, and whose affinities to, or within, osteichthyans have been debated(1-11). The bones are a characteristic osteichthyan maxillary and dentary, but the organization of the tooth-like denticles they bear differs from the large, conical teeth of crown-group osteichthyans, indicating that they can be assigned to the stem group. Andreolepis and Lophosteus are thus not only the oldest but also the most phylogenetically basal securely identified osteichthyans known so far.","Botella, Hector; Blom, Henning; Dorka, Markus; Ahlberg, Per Erik; Janvier, Philippe","Botella, H; Blom, H; Dorka, M; Ahlberg, PE; Janvier, P",583.0,"Museum Natl Hist Nat, CNRS, Dept Hist Terre, UMR 5143, F-75231 Paris 05, France; Nat Hist Museum, Dept Palaeontol, London SW7 5BD, England; Univ Valencia, Dept Geol, E-46100 Valencia, Spain; Uppsala Univ, Dept Physiol & Dev Biol, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden; Humboldt Univ, Museum Naturkunde, D-10115 Berlin, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature05989,Article,,janvier@mnhn.fr,586,,,195XV,,,LOPHOSTEUS-SUPERBUS PANDER; DENTITIONS; ORIGIN; SCALES,7153.0,NATURE,Nature,English,28.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2-Aug,4.0,LONDON,17671501.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007.0,"Ahlberg, Per/E-8086-2013","Janvier, P (reprint author), Museum Natl Hist Nat, CNRS, Dept Hist Terre, UMR 5143, 47 Rue Cuvier, F-75231 Paris 05, France.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,49.0,Jaws and teeth of the earliest bony fishes,3.0,26.0,WOS:000248446700041,497.0,448.0,Multidisciplinary Sciences,53.0,philippe,janvier,7305.0,605.0,male,0.99,aIygpCcAAAAJ,3.0,"(4126, 9345]",21279624,1,21279624,1
92,163,5.0,"Some evolutionary innovations may originate non-adaptively as exaptations, or pre-adaptations, which are by-products of other adaptive traits(1-5). Examples include feathers, which originated before they were used in flight(2), and lens crystallins, which are light-refracting proteins that originated as enzymes(6). The question of how often adaptive traits have non-adaptive origins has profound implications for evolutionary biology, but is difficult to address systematically. Here we consider this issue in metabolism, one of the most ancient biological systems that is central to all life. We analyse a metabolic trait of great adaptive importance: the ability of a metabolic reaction network to synthesize all biomass from a single source of carbon and energy. We use novel computational methods to sample randomly many metabolic networks that can sustain life on any given carbon source but contain an otherwise random set of known biochemical reactions. We show that when we require such networks to be viable on one particular carbon source, they are typically also viable on multiple other carbon sources that were not targets of selection. For example, viability on glucose may entail viability on up to 44 other sole carbon sources. Any one adaptation in these metabolic systems typically entails multiple potential exaptations. Metabolic systems thus contain a latent potential for evolutionary innovations with non-adaptive origins. Our observations suggest that many more metabolic traits may have non-adaptive origins than is appreciated at present. They also challenge our ability to distinguish adaptive from non-adaptive traits.","Barve, Aditya; Wagner, Andreas","Barve, A; Wagner, A",203.0,"[Barve, Aditya; Wagner, Andreas] Univ Zurich, Inst Evolutionary Biol & Environm Sci, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Barve, Aditya; Wagner, Andreas] Swiss Inst Bioinformat, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Wagner, Andreas] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12301,Article,1476-4687,andreas.wagner@ieu.uzh.ch,+,Swiss National Science Foundation [315230-129708],"We thank K.

93,25,113.0,"Although pioneered by human geneticists as a potential solution to the challenging problem of finding the genetic basis of common human diseases(1,2), genome-wide association (GWA) studies have, owing to advances in genotyping and sequencing technology, become an obvious general approach for studying the genetics of natural variation and traits of agricultural importance. They are particularly useful when inbred lines are available, because once these lines have been genotyped they can be phenotyped multiple times, making it possible (as well as extremely cost effective) to study many different traits in many different environments, while replicating the phenotypic measurements to reduce environmental noise. Here we demonstrate the power of this approach by carrying out a GWA study of 107 phenotypes in Arabidopsis thaliana, a widely distributed, predominantly self-fertilizing model plant known to harbour considerable genetic variation for many adaptively important traits(3). Our results are dramatically different from those of human GWA studies, in that we identify many common alleles of major effect, but they are also, in many cases, harder to interpret because confounding by complex genetics and population structure make it difficult to distinguish true associations from false. However, a-priori candidates are significantly over-represented among these associations as well, making many of them excellent candidates for follow-up experiments. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of GWA studies in A. thaliana and suggests that the approach will be appropriate for many other organisms.","Atwell, Susanna; Huang, Yu S.; Vilhjalmsson, Bjarni J.; Willems, Glenda; Horton, Matthew; Li, Yan; Meng, Dazhe; Platt, Alexander; Tarone, Aaron M.; Hu, Tina T.; Jiang, Rong; Muliyati, N.

94,35,419.0,"The nature of the pseudogap phase is a central problem in the effort to understand the high-transition-temperature (high-T-c) copper oxide superconductors(1). A fundamental question is what symmetries are broken when the pseudogap phase sets in, which occurs when the temperature decreases below a value T*. There is evidence from measurements of both polarized neutron diffraction(2,3) and the polar Kerr effect(4) that time-reversal symmetry is broken, but at temperatures that differ significantly from one another. Broken rotational symmetry was detected from both resistivity measurements(5) and inelastic neutron scattering(6-8) at low doping, and from scanning tunnelling spectroscopy(9,10) at low temperature, but showed no clear relation to T*. Here we report the observation of a large in-plane anisotropy of the Nernst effect in YBa2Cu3Oy that sets in precisely at T* throughout the doping phase diagram. We show that the CuO chains of the orthorhombic lattice are not responsible for this anisotropy, which is therefore an intrinsic property of the CuO2 planes. We conclude that the pseudogap phase is an electronic state that strongly breaks four-fold rotational symmetry. This narrows the range of possible states considerably, pointing to stripe or nematic order(11,12).","Daou, R.; Chang, J.; LeBoeuf, David; Cyr-Choiniere, Olivier; Laliberte, Francis; Doiron-Leyraud, Nicolas; Ramshaw, B.

95,79,197.0,"Antagonistic interactions between hosts and parasites are a key structuring force in natural populations, driving coevolution(1,2). However, direct empirical evidence of long-term host-parasite coevolution, in particular `Red Queen' dynamics-in which antagonistic biotic interactions such as host-parasite interactions can lead to reciprocal evolutionary dynamics-is rare(3-5), and current data, although consistent with theories of antagonistic coevolution, do not reveal the temporal dynamics of the process(6). Dormant stages of both the water flea Daphnia and its microparasites are conserved in lake sediments, providing an archive of past gene pools. Here we use this fact to reconstruct rapid coevolutionary dynamics in a natural setting and show that the parasite rapidly adapts to its host over a period of only a few years. A coevolutionary model based on negative frequency-dependent selection, and designed to mimic essential aspects of our host parasite system, corroborated these experimental results. In line with the idea of continuing host-parasite coevolution, temporal variation in parasite infectivity changed little over time. In contrast, from the moment the parasite was first found in the sediments, we observed a steady increase in virulence over time, associated with higher fitness of the parasite.","Decaestecker, Ellen; Gaba, Sabrina; Raeymaekers, Joost A.

96,199,68.0,"The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase is a master regulator of protein synthesis that couples nutrient sensing to cell growth and cancer. However, the downstream translationally regulated nodes of gene expression that may direct cancer development are poorly characterized. Using ribosome profiling, we uncover specialized translation of the prostate cancer genome by oncogenic mTOR signalling, revealing a remarkably specific repertoire of genes involved in cell proliferation, metabolism and invasion. We extend these findings by functionally characterizing a class of translationally controlled pro-invasion messenger RNAs that we show direct prostate cancer invasion and metastasis downstream of oncogenic mTOR signalling. Furthermore, we develop a clinically relevant ATP site inhibitor of mTOR, INK128, which reprograms this gene expression signature with therapeutic benefit for prostate cancer metastasis, for which there is presently no cure. Together, these findings extend our understanding of how the 'cancerous' translation machinery steers specific cancer cell behaviours, including metastasis, and may be therapeutically targeted.","Hsieh, Andrew C.; Liu, Yi; Edlind, Merritt P.; Ingolia, Nicholas T.; Janes, Matthew R.; Sher, Annie; Shi, Evan Y.; Stumpf, Craig R.; Christensen, Carly; Bonham, Michael J.; Wang, Shunyou; Ren, Pingda; Martin, Michael; Jessen, Katti; Feldman, Morris E.; Weissman, Jonathan S.; Shokat, Kevan M.; Rommel, Christian; Ruggero, Davide","Hsieh, AC; Liu, Y; Edlind, MP; Ingolia, NT; Janes, MR; Sher, A; Shi, EY; Stumpf, CR; Christensen, C; Bonham, MJ; Wang, SY; Ren, PD; Martin, M; Jessen, K; Feldman, ME; Weissman, JS; Shokat, KM; Rommel, C; Ruggero, D",55.0,"[Hsieh, Andrew C.; Edlind, Merritt P.; Sher, Annie; Shi, Evan Y.; Stumpf, Craig R.; Christensen, Carly; Ruggero, Davide] Univ Calif San Francisco, Helen Diller Family Comprehens Canc Ctr, Sch Med, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Hsieh, Andrew C.; Edlind, Merritt P.; Sher, Annie; Shi, Evan Y.; Stumpf, Craig R.; Christensen, Carly; Ruggero, Davide] Univ Calif San Francisco, Helen Diller Family Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dept Urol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Hsieh, Andrew C.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Internal Med, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Hsieh, Andrew C.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Div Hematol Oncol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Liu, Yi; Janes, Matthew R.; Wang, Shunyou; Ren, Pingda; Martin, Michael; Jessen, Katti; Rommel, Christian] Intellikine Inc, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Ingolia, Nicholas T.] Carnegie Inst Sci, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Bonham, Michael J.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pathol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Feldman, Morris E.; Weissman, Jonathan S.; Shokat, Kevan M.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Cellular & Mol Pharmacol, Howard Hughes Med Inst, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10912,Article,,christian@intellikine.com; davide.ruggero@ucsf.edu,U196,"American Cancer Society [119084-PF-10-233-01-TBE]; DOD; NIH [R01 CA154916, R01 CA140456]; Phi Beta Psi Sorority","We thank M.

97,131,289.0,"Replication fork stalling can promote genomic instability, predisposing to cancer and other diseases(1-3). Stalled replication forks may be processed by sister chromatid recombination (SCR), generating error-free or error-prone homologous recombination (HR) outcomes(4-8). In mammalian cells, a long-standing hypothesis proposes that the major hereditary breast/ovarian cancer predisposition gene products, BRCA1 and BRCA2, control HR/SCR at stalled replication forks(9). Although BRCA1 and BRCA2 affect replication fork processing(10-12), direct evidence that BRCA gene products regulate homologous recombination at stalled chromosomal replication forks is lacking, due to a dearth of tools for studying this process. Here we report that the Escherichia coli Tus/Ter complex(13-16) can be engineered to induce site-specific replication fork stalling and chromosomal HR/SCR in mouse cells. Tus/Ter-induced homologous recombination entails processing of bidirectionally arrested forks. We find that the Brca1 carboxy (C)-terminal tandem BRCT repeat and regions of Brca1 encoded by exon 11-two Brca1 elements implicated in tumour suppression-control Tus/Ter-induced homologous recombination. Inactivation of either Brca1 or Brca2 increases the absolute frequency of 'long-tract' gene conversions at Tus/Ter-stalled forks, an outcome not observed in response to a site-specific endonuclease-mediated chromosomal double-strand break. Therefore, homologous recombination at stalled forks is regulated differently from homologous recombination at double-strand breaks arising independently of a replication fork. We propose that aberrant long-tract homologous recombination at stalled replication forks contributes to genomic instability and breast/ovarian cancer predisposition in BRCA mutant cells.","Willis, Nicholas A.; Chandramouly, Gurushankar; Huang, Bin; Kwok, Amy; Follonier, Cindy; Deng, Chuxia; Scully, Ralph","Willis, NA; Chandramouly, G; Huang, B; Kwok, A; Follonier, C; Deng, CX; Scully, R",556.0,"[Willis, Nicholas A.; Chandramouly, Gurushankar; Huang, Bin; Kwok, Amy; Scully, Ralph] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Willis, Nicholas A.; Chandramouly, Gurushankar; Huang, Bin; Kwok, Amy; Scully, Ralph] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Follonier, Cindy] Princeton Univ, Lewis Thomas Lab 101, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Deng, Chuxia] NIDDK, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13295,Article,1476-4687,rscully@bidmc.harvard.edu,+,"NIH [R01CA095175, R01GM073894, R21CA144017, R37GM26938]; NIH/NCI [5T32CA081156]; ACS [PF-12-248-01-DMC]","We thank B.

98,119,437.0,"Fructose is a major component of dietary sugar and its overconsumption exacerbates key pathological features of metabolic syndrome. The central fructose-metabolising enzyme is ketohexokinase (KHK), which exists in two isoforms: KHK-A and KHK-C, generated through mutually exclusive alternative splicing of KHK pre-mRNAs. KHK-C displays superior affinity for fructose compared with KHK-A and is produced primarily in the liver, thus restricting fructose metabolism almost exclusively to this organ. Here we show that myocardial hypoxia actuates fructose metabolism in human and mouse models of pathological cardiac hypertrophy through hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1 alpha) activation of SF3B1 and SF3B1-mediated splice switching of KHK-A to KHK-C. Heart-specific depletion of SF3B1 orgenetic ablation of Khk, but not Khk-A alone, in mice, suppresses pathological stress-induced fructose metabolism, growth and contractile dysfunction, thus defining signalling components and molecular underpinnings of a fructose metabolism regulatory system crucial for pathological growth.","Mirtschink, Peter; Krishnan, Jaya; Grimm, Fiona; Sarre, Alexandre; Hoerl, Manuel; Kayikci, Melis; Fankhauser, Niklaus; Christinat, Yann; Cortijo, Cedric; Feehan, Owen; Vukolic, Ana; Sossalla, Samuel; Stehr, Sebastian N.; Ule, Jernej; Zamboni, Nicola; Pedrazzini, Thierry; Krek, Wilhelm","Mirtschink, P; Krishnan, J; Grimm, F; Sarre, A; Horl, M; Kayikci, M; Fankhauser, N; Christinat, Y; Cortijo, C; Feehan, O; Vukolic, A; Sossalla, S; Stehr, SN; Ule, J; Zamboni, N; Pedrazzini, T; Krek, W",444.0,"[Mirtschink, Peter; Krishnan, Jaya; Grimm, Fiona; Fankhauser, Niklaus; Christinat, Yann; Cortijo, Cedric; Feehan, Owen; Vukolic, Ana; Krek, Wilhelm] ETH, Inst Mol Hlth Sci, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Sarre, Alexandre; Pedrazzini, Thierry] Univ Lausanne, Dept Med, CH-1011 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Hoerl, Manuel; Zamboni, Nicola] ETH, Inst Mol Syst Biol, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Kayikci, Melis; Ule, Jernej] MRC Lab Mol Biol, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England; [Sossalla, Samuel] Univ Med Gottingen, Klin Kardiol & Pneumol, D-37075 Gottingen, Germany; [Sossalla, Samuel] DZHK German Ctr Cardiovasc Res, Partner Site Gottingen, Hamburg, Germany; [Stehr, Sebastian N.] Univ Hosp Jena, Dept Anesthesiol & Crit Care Med, D-07747 Jena, Germany",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14508,Article,1476-4687,wilhelm.krek@biol.ethz.ch,+,Sinergia (Swiss National Science Foundation); Swiss Heart Foundation,"We thank S.

99,91,479.0,"Symmetry-breaking interactions have a crucial role in many areas of physics, ranging from classical ferrofluids to superfluid He-3 and d-wave superconductivity. For superfluid quantum gases, a variety of new physical phenomena arising from the symmetry-breaking interaction between electric or magnetic dipoles are expected(1). Novel quantum phases in optical lattices, such as chequerboard or supersolid phases, are predicted for dipolar bosons(2,3). Dipolar interactions can also enrich considerably the physics of quantum gases with internal degrees of freedom(4-6). Arrays of dipolar particles could be used for efficient quantum information processing(7). Here we report the realization of a chromium Bose-Einstein condensate with strong dipolar interactions. By using a Feshbach resonance, we reduce the usual isotropic contact interaction, such that the anisotropic magnetic dipole-dipole interaction between Cr-52 atoms becomes comparable in strength. This induces a change of the aspect ratio of the atom cloud; for strong dipolar interactions, the inversion of ellipticity during expansion (the usual 'smoking gun' evidence for a Bose-Einstein condensate) can be suppressed. These effects are accounted for by taking into account the dipolar interaction in the superfluid hydrodynamic equations governing the dynamics of the gas, in the same way as classical ferrofluids can be described by including dipolar terms in the classical hydrodynamic equations. Our results are a first step in the exploration of the unique properties of quantum ferrofluids.","Lahaye, Thierry; Koch, Tobias; Froehlich, Bernd; Fattori, Marco; Metz, Jonas; Griesmaier, Axel; Giovanazzi, Stefano; Pfau, Tilman","Lahaye, T; Koch, T; Frohlich, B; Fattori, M; Metz, J; Griesmaier, A; Giovanazzi, S; Pfau, T",672.0,"Univ Stuttgart, Inst Phys 5, D-70550 Stuttgart, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06036,Article,,t.lahaye@physik.uni-stuttgart.de; t.pfau@physik.uni-stuttgart.de,U5,,,197ZY,Y,N,BOSE-EINSTEIN CONDENSATE; FESHBACH RESONANCES; COLD MOLECULES; GASES,7154.0,NATURE,Nature,English,25.0,No,"Lahaye, Thierry/0000-0002-2260-9859","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",9-Aug,5.0,LONDON,17687319.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007.0,"Griesmaier, Axel/E-8243-2010; Giovanazzi, Stefano/C-2158-2012; Pfau, Tilman/G-1774-2011; Lahaye, Thierry/E-1551-2017","Lahaye, T (reprint author), Univ Stuttgart, Inst Phys 5, Pfaffenwaldring 57, D-70550 Stuttgart, Germany.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,326.0,Strong dipolar effects in a quantum ferrofluid,8.0,71.0,WOS:000248598000039,479.0,448.0,Multidisciplinary Sciences,327.0,tilman,pfau,14675.0,4.0,male,1.0,2Ib19-YAAAAJ,4.0,"(9345, 17929]",na,0,na,0
100,47,295.0,"The Myc oncogene regulates the expression of several components of the protein synthetic machinery, including ribosomal proteins, initiation factors of translation, RNA polymerase III and ribosomal DNA(1,2). Whether and how increasing the cellular protein synthesis capacity affects the multistep process leading to cancer remains to be addressed. Here we use ribosomal protein heterozygote mice as a genetic tool to restore increased protein synthesis in E mu-Myc/+ transgenic mice to normal levels, and show that the oncogenic potential of Myc in this context is suppressed. Our findings demonstrate that the ability of Myc to increase protein synthesis directly augments cell size and is sufficient to accelerate cell cycle progression independently of known cell cycle targets transcriptionally regulated by Myc. In addition, when protein synthesis is restored to normal levels, Myc- overexpressing precancerous cells are more efficiently eliminated by programmed cell death. Our findings reveal a new mechanism that links increases in general protein synthesis rates downstream of an oncogenic signal to a specific molecular impairment in the modality of translation initiation used to regulate the expression of selective messenger RNAs. We show that an aberrant increase in cap- dependent translation downstream of Myc hyperactivation specifically impairs the translational switch to internal ribosomal entry site ( IRES)- dependent translation that is required for accurate mitotic progression. Failure of this translational switch results in reduced mitotic- specific expression of the endogenous IRES- dependent form of Cdk11 ( also known as Cdc21 and PITSLRE)(3-5), which leads to cytokinesis defects and is associated with increased centrosome numbers and genome instability in E mu-Myc/+ mice. When accurate translational control is re- established in E mu-Myc/+ mice, genome instability is suppressed. Our findings demonstrate how perturbations in translational control provide a highly specific outcome for gene expression, genome stability and cancer initiation that have important implications for understanding the molecular mechanism of cancer formation at the post- genomic level.","Barna, Maria; Pusic, Aya; Zollo, Ornella; Costa, Maria; Kondrashov, Nadya; Rego, Eduardo; Rao, Pulivarthi H.; Ruggero, Davide","Barna, M; Pusic, A; Zollo, O; Costa, M; Kondrashov, N; Rego, E; Rao, PH; Ruggero, D",971.0,"[Barna, Maria; Kondrashov, Nadya] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem & Biophys, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Pusic, Aya; Zollo, Ornella; Costa, Maria; Ruggero, Davide] Univ Calif San Francisco, Helen Diller Family Comprehens Canc Ctr, Sch Med, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Pusic, Aya; Zollo, Ornella; Costa, Maria; Ruggero, Davide] Univ Calif San Francisco, Helen Diller Family Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dept Urol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Rego, Eduardo] Univ Sao Paulo, Ctr Cell Based Therapy, Fdn Hemoctr Ribeirao Preto, BR-14048900 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Rao, Pulivarthi H.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Pediat, Houston, TX 77030 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07449,Article,1476-4687,maria.barna@ucsf.edu; Davide.Ruggero@ucsf.edu,U79,NIH; Sandler Foundation,"We thank F.

101,215,109.0,"Fumarate hydratase (FH) is an enzyme of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) that catalyses the hydration of fumarate into malate. Germline mutations of FH are responsible for hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal-cell cancer (HLRCC)(1). It has previously been demonstrated that the absence of FH leads to the accumulation of fumarate, which activates hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) at normal oxygen tensions(2-4). However, so far no mechanism that explains the ability of cells to survive without a functional TCA cycle has been provided. Here we use newly characterized genetically modified kidney mouse cells in which Fh1 has been deleted, and apply a newly developed computer model of the metabolism of these cells to predict and experimentally validate a linear metabolic pathway beginning with glutamine uptake and ending with bilirubin excretion from Fh1-deficient cells. This pathway, which involves the biosynthesis and degradation of haem, enables Fh1-deficient cells to use the accumulated TCA cycle metabolites and permits partial mitochondrial NADH production. We predicted and confirmed that targeting this pathway would render Fh1-deficient cells nonviable, while sparing wild-type Fh1-containing cells. This work goes beyond identifying a metabolic pathway that is induced in Fh1-deficient cells to demonstrate that inhibition of haem oxygenation is synthetically lethal when combined with Fh1 deficiency, providing a new potential target for treating HLRCC patients.","Frezza, Christian; Zheng, Liang; Folger, Ori; Rajagopalan, Kartik N.; MacKenzie, Elaine D.; Jerby, Livnat; Micaroni, Massimo; Chaneton, Barbara; Adam, Julie; Hedley, Ann; Kalna, Gabriela; Tomlinson, Ian P.

102,15,339.0,"X-ray tomography is an invaluable tool in biomedical imaging. It can deliver the three-dimensional internal structure of entire organisms as well as that of single cells, and even gives access to quantitative information, crucially important both for medical applications and for basic research(1-4). Most frequently such information is based on X-ray attenuation. Phase contrast is sometimes used for improved visibility but remains significantly harder to quantify(5,6). Here we describe an X-ray computed tomography technique that generates quantitative high-contrast three-dimensional electron density maps from phase contrast information without reverting to assumptions of a weak phase object or negligible absorption. This method uses a ptychographic coherent imaging approach to record tomographic data sets, exploiting both the high penetration power of hard X-rays and the high sensitivity of lensless imaging(7-9). As an example, we present images of a bone sample in which structures on the 100 nm length scale such as the osteocyte lacunae and the interconnective canalicular network are clearly resolved. The recovered electron density map provides a contrast high enough to estimate nanoscale bone density variations of less than one per cent. We expect this high-resolution tomography technique to provide invaluable information for both the life and materials sciences.","Dierolf, Martin; Menzel, Andreas; Thibault, Pierre; Schneider, Philipp; Kewish, Cameron M.; Wepf, Roger; Bunk, Oliver; Pfeiffer, Franz","Dierolf, M; Menzel, A; Thibault, P; Schneider, P; Kewish, CM; Wepf, R; Bunk, O; Pfeiffer, F",436.0,"[Dierolf, Martin; Thibault, Pierre; Pfeiffer, Franz] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Phys E17, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Menzel, Andreas; Kewish, Cameron M.; Bunk, Oliver] Paul Scherrer Inst, Swiss Light Source, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland; [Schneider, Philipp] ETH, Inst Biomech, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Wepf, Roger] EMEZ, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09419,Article,,pierre.thibault@tum.de,U82,"DFG Cluster of Excellence ""Munich-Centre for Advanced Photonics""","We acknowledge technical support by X.

103,50,438.0,"The ability to cross host barriers is an essential virulence determinant of invasive microbial pathogens. Listeria monocytogenes is a model microorganism that crosses human intestinal and placental barriers, and causes severe maternofetal infections by an unknown mechanism(1). Several studies have helped to characterize the bacterial invasion proteins InlA and InlB(2). However, their respective species specificity has complicated investigations on their in vivo role(3,4). Here we describe two novel and complementary animal models for human listeriosis: the gerbil, a natural host for L. monocytogenes, and a knock- in mouse line ubiquitously expressing humanized E- cadherin. Using these two models, we uncover the essential and interdependent roles of InlA and InlB in fetoplacental listeriosis, and thereby decipher the molecular mechanism underlying the ability of a microbe to target and cross the placental barrier.","Disson, Olivier; Grayo, Solene; Huillet, Eugenie; Nikitas, Georgios; Langa-Vives, Francina; Dussurget, Olivier; Ragon, Marie; Le Monnier, Alban; Babinet, Charles; Cossart, Pascale; Lecuit, Marc","Disson, O; Grayo, S; Huillet, E; Nikitas, G; Langa-Vives, F; Dussurget, O; Ragon, M; Le Monnier, A; Babinet, C; Cossart, P; Lecuit, M",1114.0,"[Disson, Olivier; Grayo, Solene; Huillet, Eugenie; Nikitas, Georgios; Dussurget, Olivier; Cossart, Pascale; Lecuit, Marc] Inst Pasteur, Grp Microorganismes & Barrieres Hote, Unite Interact Bacteries Cellules, F-75015 Paris, France; [Disson, Olivier; Grayo, Solene; Nikitas, Georgios; Lecuit, Marc] Inserm Avenir, U604, F-75015 Paris, France; [Grayo, Solene; Ragon, Marie; Le Monnier, Alban; Lecuit, Marc] Inst Pasteur, Ctr Natl Reference Listeria, F-75015 Paris, France; [Huillet, Eugenie; Dussurget, Olivier; Cossart, Pascale] INSERM, U604, F-75015 Paris, France; [Huillet, Eugenie; Dussurget, Olivier; Cossart, Pascale] INRA, USC2020, F-75015 Paris, France; [Langa-Vives, Francina] Inst Pasteur, Ctr Ingn Genet Murine, F-75015 Paris, France; [Babinet, Charles] Inst Pasteur, Dev Biol Unit, F-75015 Paris, France; [Lecuit, Marc] Univ Paris 05, Ctr Infectiol Necker Pasteur, Serv Malad Infect & Trop, Hop Necker Enfants Malad,Assistance Publ Hop Pari, F-75015 Paris, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07303,Article,,mlecuit@pasteur.fr,1118,"Institut Pasteur, Inserm; INRA; Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale; Howard Hughes Medical Institute international research scholar","This paper is dedicated to the memory of Charles Babinet, our friend and colleague, who died a few days before the submission of thismanuscript.

104,122,95.0,"We sequenced the genomes of a similar to 7,000-year-old farmer from Germany and eight similar to 8,000-year-old hunter-gatherers from Luxembourg and Sweden. We analysed these and other ancient genomes(1-4) with 2,345 contemporary humans to show that most present-day Europeans derive from at least three highly differentiated populations: west European hunter-gatherers, who contributed ancestry to all Europeans but not to Near Easterners; ancient north Eurasians related to Upper Palaeolithic Siberians(3), who contributed to both Europeans and Near Easterners; and early European farmers, who were mainly of Near Eastern origin but also harboured west European hunter-gatherer related ancestry. We model these populations' deep relationships and show that early European farmers had similar to 44% ancestry from a 'basal Eurasian' population that split before the diversification of other non-African lineages.","Lazaridis, Iosif; Patterson, Nick; Mittnik, Alissa; Renaud, Gabriel; Mallick, Swapan; Kirsanow, Karola; Sudmant, Peter H.; Schraiber, Joshua G.; Castellano, Sergi; Lipson, Mark; Berger, Bonnie; Economou, Christos; Bollongino, Ruth; Fu, Qiaomei; Bos, Kirsten I.; Nordenfelt, Susanne; Li, Heng; de Filippo, Cesare; Pruefer, Kay; Sawyer, Susanna; Posth, Cosimo; Haak, Wolfgang; Hallgren, Fredrik; Fornander, Elin; Rohland, Nadin; Delsate, Dominique; Francken, Michael; Guinet, Jean-Michel; Wahl, Joachim; Ayodo, George; Babiker, Hamza A.; Bailliet, Graciela; Balanovska, Elena; Balanovsky, Oleg; Barrantes, Ramiro; Bedoya, Gabriel; Ben-Ami, Haim; Bene, Judit; Berrada, Fouad; Bravi, Claudio M.; Brisighelli, Francesca; Busby, George B.

105,174,235.0,"Accurate segregation of the replicated genome requires chromosome biorientation on the spindle. Biorientation is ensured by Aurora B kinase (Ipl1), a member of the four-subunit chromosomal passenger complex (CPC)(1,2). Localization of the CPC to the inner centromere is central to the current model for how tension ensures chromosome biorientation: kinetochore-spindle attachments that are not under tension remain close to the inner centromere and are destabilized by Aurora B phosphorylation, whereas kinetochores under tension are pulled away from the influence of Aurora B, stabilizing their microtubule attachments(3-5). Here we show that an engineered truncation of the Sli15 (known as INCENP in humans) subunit of budding yeast CPC that eliminates association with the inner centromere nevertheless supports proper chromosome segregation during both mitosis and meiosis. Truncated Sli15 suppresses the deletion phenotypes of the innercentromere-targeting proteins survivin (Bir1), borealin (Nbl1), Bub1 and Sgo1 (ref. 6). Unlike wild-type Sli15, truncated Sli15 localizes to pre-anaphase spindle microtubules. Premature targeting of full-length Sli15 to microtubules by preventing Cdk1 (also known as Cdc28) phosphorylation also suppresses the inviability of Bir1 deletion. These results suggest that activation of Aurora B kinase by clustering either on chromatin or on microtubules is sufficient for chromosome biorientation.","Campbell, Christopher S.; Desai, Arshad","Campbell, CS; Desai, A",118.0,"[Campbell, Christopher S.; Desai, Arshad] Univ Calif San Diego, Ludwig Inst Canc Res, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Campbell, Christopher S.; Desai, Arshad] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Cellular & Mol Med, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12057,Article,,abdesai@ucsd.edu,+,National Institutes of Health (NIH) [GM074215]; Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation Fellowship [DRG 2007-09]; Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research,"The authors would like to thank the Desai and Oegema laboratories for discussions; S.

106,196,459.0,"Discovering the unintended 'off-targets' that predict adverse drug reactions is daunting by empirical methods alone. Drugs can act on several protein targets, some of which can be unrelated by conventional molecular metrics, and hundreds of proteins have been implicated in side effects. Here we use a computational strategy to predict the activity of 656 marketed drugs on 73 unintended 'side-effect' targets. Approximately half of the predictions were confirmed, either from proprietary databases unknown to the method or by new experimental assays. Affinities for these new off-targets ranged from 1nM to 30 mu M. To explore relevance, we developed an association metric to prioritize those new off-targets that explained side effects better than any known target of a given drug, creating a drug-target-adverse drug reaction network. Among these new associations was the prediction that the abdominal pain side effect of the synthetic oestrogen chlorotrianisene was mediated through its newly discovered inhibition of the enzyme cyclooxygenase-1. The clinical relevance of this inhibition was borne out in whole human blood platelet aggregation assays. This approach may have wide application to de-risking toxicological liabilities in drug discovery.","Lounkine, Eugen; Keiser, Michael J.; Whitebread, Steven; Mikhailov, Dmitri; Hamon, Jacques; Jenkins, Jeremy L.; Lavan, Paul; Weber, Eckhard; Doak, Allison K.; Cote, Serge; Shoichet, Brian K.; Urban, Laszlo","Lounkine, E; Keiser, MJ; Whitebread, S; Mikhailov, D; Hamon, J; Jenkins, JL; Lavan, P; Weber, E; Doak, AK; Cote, S; Shoichet, BK; Urban, L",361.0,"[Lounkine, Eugen; Whitebread, Steven; Mikhailov, Dmitri; Jenkins, Jeremy L.; Urban, Laszlo] Novartis Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Keiser, Michael J.] SeaChange Pharmaceut Inc, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Keiser, Michael J.; Doak, Allison K.; Shoichet, Brian K.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pharmaceut Chem, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Hamon, Jacques; Lavan, Paul; Weber, Eckhard; Cote, Serge] Novartis Inst Biomed Res, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11159,Article,,jeremy.jenkins@novartis.com; shoichet@cgl.ucsf.edu; laszlo.urban@novartis.com,+,"US National Institutes of Health [GM71896, AG002132, GM93456]; QB3 Rogers Family Foundation 'Bridging-the-Gap' Award","E.

107,153,326.0,"Shoot growth depends on meristems, pools of stem cells that are maintained by a negative feedback loop between the CLAVATA pathway and the WUSCHEL homeobox gene(1). CLAVATA signalling involves a secreted peptide, CLAVATA3 (CLV3)(2), and its perception by cell surface leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptors, including the CLV1 receptor kinase(3) and a LRR receptor-like protein, CLV2 (ref. 4). However, the signalling mechanisms downstream of these receptors are poorly understood, especially for LRR receptor-like proteins, which lack a signalling domain(5). Here we show that maize COMPACT PLANT2 (CT2) encodes the predicted alpha-subunit (G alpha) of a heterotrimeric GTP binding protein. Maize ct2 phenotypes resemble Arabidopsis thaliana clavata mutants, and genetic, biochemical and functional assays indicate that CT2/G alpha transmits a stem-cell-restrictive signal from a CLAVATA LRR receptor, suggesting a new function for G alpha signalling in plants. Heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins are membrane-associated molecular switches that are commonly activated by ligand binding to an associated seven-pass transmembrane (7TM) G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)(6). Recent studies have questioned the idea that plant heterotrimeric G proteins interact with canonical GPCRs(7), and our findings suggest that single pass transmembrane receptors act as GPCRs in plants, challenging the dogma that GPCRs are exclusively 7TM proteins.","Bommert, Peter; Il Je, Byoung; Goldshmidt, Alexander; Jackson, David","Bommert, P; Il Je, B; Goldshmidt, A; Jackson, D",555.0,"[Bommert, Peter; Il Je, Byoung; Goldshmidt, Alexander; Jackson, David] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12583,Article,1476-4687,jacksond@cshl.edu,+,DFG [Bo 3012/1-1]; BARD [FI-431-2008]; Dupont-Pioneer; National Science Foundation [DBI-0604923],"The authors thank T.

108,93,25.0,"X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements provide us with atomically resolved structures of an ever-growing number of biomolecules. These static structural snapshots are important to our understanding of biomolecular function, but real biomolecules are dynamic entities that often exploit conformational changes and transient molecular interactions to perform their tasks. Nuclear magnetic resonance methods can follow such structural changes, but only on millisecond timescales under non-equilibrium conditions. Time-resolved X-ray crystallography has recently been used to monitor the photodissociation of CO from myoglobin on a subnanosecond timescale(1), yet remains challenging to apply more widely. In contrast, two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy, which maps vibrational coupling between molecular groups and hence their relative positions and orientations(2-11), is now routinely used to study equilibrium processes on picosecond timescales. Here we show that the extension of this method into the non-equilibrium regime(12,13) allows us to observe in real time in a short peptide the weakening of an intramolecular hydrogen bond and concomitant opening of a beta-turn. We find that the rate of this process is two orders of magnitude faster than the 'folding speed limit' established for contact formation between protein side chains(14).","Kolano, Christoph; Helbing, Jan; Kozinski, Mariusz; Sander, Wolfram; Hamm, Peter","Kolano, C; Helbing, J; Kozinski, M; Sander, W; Hamm, P",469.0,"Univ Zurich, Inst Phys Chem, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; Ruhr Univ Bochum, Lehrstuhl Organ Chem 2, D-44801 Bochum, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature05352,Article,,c.kolano@pci.unizh.ch; p.hamm@pci.unizh.ch,472,,,108BQ,,,PICOSECOND CONFORMATIONAL TRANSITION; SPEED LIMIT; VIBRATIONAL SPECTROSCOPY; PHOTOSWITCHABLE PEPTIDE; ALPHA-HELIX; 2D IR; PROTEIN; WATER; ISOTOPOMERS; DISULFIDE,7118.0,NATURE,Nature,English,28.0,No,"Hamm, Peter/0000-0003-1106-6032","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",23-Nov,4.0,LONDON,17122853.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,"Helbing, Jan/A-5609-2013; Hamm, Peter/O-1247-2013","Kolano, C (reprint author), Univ Zurich, Inst Phys Chem, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,239.0,Watching hydrogen-bond dynamics in a beta-turn by transient two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy,9.0,107.0,WOS:000242215700042,25.0,444.0,Multidisciplinary Sciences,243.0,peter,hamm,13194.0,4373.0,male,1.0,YGjk6v0AAAAJ,4.0,"(9345, 17929]",179125,1,3634471,1
109,97,79.0,"Females often mate with several males before producing offspring(1). Field studies of vertebrates suggest, and laboratory experiments on invertebrates confirm, that even when males provide no material benefits, polyandry can enhance offspring survival(2,3). This enhancement is widely attributed to genetic benefits that arise whenever paternity is biased towards males that sire more viable offspring(1,4,5). Field studies suggest that post-mating sexual selection biases fertilization towards genetically more compatible males(6,7) and one controlled experiment has shown that, when females mate with close kin, polyandry reduces the relative number of inbred offspring(8). Another potential genetic benefit of polyandry is that it increases offspring survival because males with more competitive ejaculates sire more viable offspring(9). Surprisingly, however, there is no unequivocal evidence for this process(10). Here, by experimentally assigning mates to females, we show that polyandry greatly increases offspring survival in the Australian marsupial Antechinus stuartii. DNA profiling shows that males that gain high paternity under sperm competition sire offspring that are more viable. This beneficial effect occurs in both the laboratory and the wild. Crucially, there are no confounding non-genetic maternal effects that could arise if polyandry increases female investment in a particular reproductive event(10) because A. stuartii is effectively semelparous. Our results therefore show that polyandry improves female lifetime fitness in nature. The threefold increase in offspring survival is not negated by a decline in maternal lifespan and is too large to be offset by an equivalent decline in the reproductive performance of surviving offspring.","Fisher, Diana O.; Double, Michael C.; Blomberg, Simon P.; Jennions, Michael D.; Cockburn, Andrew","Fisher, DO; Double, MC; Blomberg, SP; Jennions, MD; Cockburn, A",89.0,"Australian Natl Univ, Sch Bot & Zool, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; Australian Natl Univ, Ctr Resource & Environm Studies, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature05206,Article,,diana.fisher@anu.edu.au,92,,,100WS,,,ANTECHINUS-STUARTII; GENETIC BENEFITS; SPERM SELECTION; PATERNITY; SUCCESS; EVOLUTION; POPULATION; CRICKET; AGILIS; MATES,7115.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,"Fisher, Diana/0000-0002-4017-3710; Jennions, Michael/0000-0001-9221-2788; Blomberg, Simon/0000-0003-1062-0839","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2-Nov,4.0,LONDON,17080089.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,"Fisher, Diana/C-1324-2010; Jennions, Michael/C-7560-2009; Blomberg, Simon/B-7613-2008","Fisher, DO (reprint author), Australian Natl Univ, Sch Bot & Zool, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,131.0,Post-mating sexual selection increases lifetime fitness of polyandrous females in the wild,5.0,72.0,WOS:000241701500051,79.0,444.0,Multidisciplinary Sciences,132.0,andrew,cockburn,9443.0,5168.0,male,1.0,HzupDnMAAAAJ,4.0,"(9345, 17929]",321359,1,88600,1
110,171,196.0,"Conventional semiconductor laser emission relies on stimulated emission of photons(1,2), which sets stringent requirements on the minimum amount of energy necessary for its operation(3,4). In comparison, exciton-polaritons in strongly coupled quantum well microcavities(5) can undergo stimulated scattering that promises more energy-efficient generation of coherent light by 'polariton lasers'(3,6). Polariton laser operation has been demonstrated in optically pumped semiconductor microcavities at temperatures up to room temperature(7-12), and such lasers can outperform their weak-coupling counterparts in that they have a lower threshold density(12,13). Even though polariton diodes have been realized(14-16), electrically pumped polariton laser operation, which is essential for practical applications, has not been achieved until now. Here we present an electrically pumped polariton laser based on a microcavity containing multiple quantum wells. To prove polariton laser emission unambiguously, we apply a magnetic field and probe the hybrid light-matter nature of the polaritons. Our results represent an important step towards the practical implementation of polaritonic light sources and electrically injected condensates, and can be extended to room-temperature operation using wide-bandgap materials.","Schneider, Christian; Rahimi-Iman, Arash; Kim, Na Young; Fischer, Julian; Savenko, Ivan G.; Amthor, Matthias; Lermer, Matthias; Wolf, Adriana; Worschech, Lukas; Kulakovskii, Vladimir D.; Shelykh, Ivan A.; Kamp, Martin; Reitzenstein, Stephan; Forchel, Alfred; Yamamoto, Yoshihisa; Hoefling, Sven","Schneider, C; Rahimi-Iman, A; Kim, NY; Fischer, J; Savenko, IG; Amthor, M; Lermer, M; Wolf, A; Worschech, L; Kulakovskii, VD; Shelykh, IA; Kamp, M; Reitzenstein, S; Forchel, A; Yamamoto, Y; Hofling, S",348.0,"[Schneider, Christian; Rahimi-Iman, Arash; Fischer, Julian; Amthor, Matthias; Lermer, Matthias; Wolf, Adriana; Worschech, Lukas; Kamp, Martin; Reitzenstein, Stephan; Forchel, Alfred; Hoefling, Sven] Univ Wurzburg, Tech Phys & Wilhelm Conrad Rontgen Res Ctr Comple, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany; [Kim, Na Young; Yamamoto, Yoshihisa] Stanford Univ, EL Ginzton Lab, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kim, Na Young] Univ Tokyo, Inst Ind Sci, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1538505, Japan; [Savenko, Ivan G.; Shelykh, Ivan A.] Univ Iceland, Inst Sci, IS-107 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Savenko, Ivan G.; Shelykh, Ivan A.] Nanyang Technol Univ, Div Phys & Appl Phys, Singapore 637371, Singapore; [Kulakovskii, Vladimir D.] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Solid State Phys, Chernogolovka 142432, Russia; [Reitzenstein, Stephan] Tech Univ Berlin, Inst Festkorperphys, D-10623 Berlin, Germany; [Yamamoto, Yoshihisa] Natl Inst Informat, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1018430, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12036,Article,1476-4687,christian.schneider@physik.uni-wuerzburg.de; sven.hoefling@physik.uni-wuerzburg.de,352,"State of Bavaria; National Science Foundation; JSPS through its FIRST programme; Eimskip foundation; 'Center of excellence in polaritonics', IRSES SPINMET project; 'Center of excellence in polaritonics', POLAPHEN project; German National Academic Foundation","This work was supported by the State of Bavaria, the National Science Foundation and by JSPS through its FIRST programme.

111,197,488.0,"The co-emergence of a six-layered cerebral neocortex and its corticospinal output system is one of the evolutionary hallmarks of mammals. However, the genetic programs that underlie their development and evolution remain poorly understood. Hereweidentify a conserved non-exonic element (E4) that acts as a cortex-specific enhancer for the nearby gene Fezf2 (also known as Fezl and Zfp312), which is required for the specification of corticospinal neuron identity and connectivity. We find that SOX4 and SOX11 functionally compete with the repressor SOX5 in the transactivation of E4. Cortex-specific double deletion of Sox4 and Sox11 leads to the loss of Fezf2 expression, failed specification of corticospinal neurons and, independent of Fezf2, a reeler-like inversion of layers. We show evidence supporting the emergence of functional SOX-binding sites in E4 during tetrapod evolution, and their subsequent stabilization in mammals and possibly amniotes. These findings reveal that SOX transcription factors converge onto a cis-acting element of Fezf2 and form critical components of a regulatory network controlling the identity and connectivity of corticospinal neurons.","Shim, Sungbo; Kwan, Kenneth Y.; Li, Mingfeng; Lefebvre, Veronique; Sestan, Nenad","Shim, SB; Kwan, KY; Li, MF; Lefebvre, V; Sestan, N",74.0,"[Shim, Sungbo; Kwan, Kenneth Y.; Li, Mingfeng; Sestan, Nenad] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Shim, Sungbo; Kwan, Kenneth Y.; Li, Mingfeng; Sestan, Nenad] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Kavli Inst Neurosci, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Lefebvre, Veronique] Cleveland Clin, Lerner Res Inst, Dept Cell Biol, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA; [Lefebvre, Veronique] Cleveland Clin, Lerner Res Inst, Orthopaed & Rheumatol Res Ctr, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11094,Article,,nenad.sestan@yale.edu,U177,"National Institutes of Health [NS054273, MH081896, AR54153]; March of Dimes Foundation; McDonnell Scholar Award","We thank W.

Evidence of eIF4G and Pab1 interaction supports the notion of a closed- loop mRNP(3), but the mechanistic events that lead to its formation and maintenance are still unknown. Here we use toeprinting and polysome profiling assays to delineate ribosome positioning at initiator AUG codons and ribosome - mRNA association, respectively, and find that two distinct stable ( resistant to cap analogue) closed- loop structures are formed during initiation in yeast cell- free extracts. The integrity of both forms requires the mRNA cap and poly( A) tail, as well as eIF4E, eIF4G, Pab1 and eIF3, and is dependent on the length of both the mRNA and the poly( A) tail. Formation of the first structure requires the 48S ribosomal complex, whereas the second requires an 80S ribosome and the termination factors eRF3/ Sup35 and eRF1/ Sup45.

113,164,24.0,"The activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID; also known as AICDA) enzyme is required for somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination at the immunoglobulin locus(1). In germinal-centre B cells, AID is highly expressed, and has an inherent mutator activity that helps generate antibody diversity(2). However, AID may also regulate gene expression epigenetically by directly deaminating 5-methylcytosine in concert with base-excision repair to exchange cytosine(3). This pathway promotes gene demethylation, thereby removing epigenetic memory. For example, AID promotes active demethylation of the genome in primordial germ cells(4). However, different studies have suggested either a requirement(5) or a lack of function(6) for AID in promoting pluripotency in somatic nuclei after fusion with embryonic stem cells. Here we tested directly whether AID regulates epigenetic memory by comparing the relative ability of cells lacking AID to reprogram from a differentiated murine cell type to an induced pluripotent stem cell. We show that Aid-null cells are transiently hyper-responsive to the reprogramming process. Although they initiate expression of pluripotency genes, they fail to stabilize in the pluripotent state. The genome of Aid-null cells remains hypermethylated in reprogramming cells, and hypermethylated genes associated with pluripotency fail to be stably upregulated, including many MYC target genes. Recent studies identified a late step of reprogramming associated with methylation status(7), and implicated a secondary set of pluripotency network components(8). AID regulates this late step, removing epigenetic memory to stabilize the pluripotent state.","Kumar, Ritu; DiMenna, Lauren; Schrode, Nadine; Liu, Ting-Chun; Franck, Philipp; Munoz-Descalzo, Silvia; Hadjantonakis, Anna-Katerina; Zarrin, Ali A.; Chaudhuri, Jayanta; Elemento, Olivier; Evans, Todd","Kumar, R; DiMenna, L; Schrode, N; Liu, TC; Franck, P; Munoz-Descalzo, S; Hadjantonakis, AK; Zarrin, AA; Chaudhuri, J; Elemento, O; Evans, T",89.0,"[Kumar, Ritu; Liu, Ting-Chun; Franck, Philipp; Evans, Todd] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Surg, New York, NY 10065 USA; [DiMenna, Lauren; Chaudhuri, Jayanta] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Sloan Kettering Inst, Immunol Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Schrode, Nadine; Munoz-Descalzo, Silvia; Hadjantonakis, Anna-Katerina] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Sloan Kettering Inst, Dev Biol Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Zarrin, Ali A.] Genentech Inc, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Elemento, Olivier] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Inst Computat Biomed, New York, NY 10065 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12299,Article,,tre2003@med.cornell.edu,U114,"National Institutes of Health [HL056182, AI072194]; National Science Foundation CAREER [1054964]","We thank G.

114,167,80.0,"53BP1 (also called TP53BP1) is a chromatin-associated factor that promotes immunoglobulin class switching and DNA double-strand-break (DSB) repair by non-homologous end joining. To accomplish its function in DNA repair, 53BP1 accumulates at DSB sites downstream of the RNF168 ubiquitin ligase. How ubiquitin recruits 53BP1 to break sites remains unknown as its relocalization involves recognition of histone H4 Lys 20 (H4K20) methylation by its Tudor domain. Here we elucidate how vertebrate 53BP1 is recruited to the chromatin that flanks DSB sites. We show that 53BP1 recognizes mononucleosomes containing dimethylated H4K20 (H4K20me2) and H2A ubiquitinated on Lys 15 (H2AK15ub), the latter being a product of RNF168 action on chromatin. 53BP1 binds to nucleosomes minimally as a dimer using its previously characterized methyl-lysine-binding Tudor domain and a carboxy-terminal extension, termed the ubiquitination-dependent recruitment (UDR) motif, which interacts with the epitope formed by H2AK15ub and its surrounding residues on the H2A tail. 53BP1 is therefore a bivalent histone modification reader that recognizes a histone 'code' produced by DSB signalling.","Fradet-Turcotte, Amelie; Canny, Marella D.; Escribano-Diaz, Cristina; Orthwein, Alexandre; Leung, Charles C.

115,147,238.0,"There are two proposed explanations for ultraluminous X-ray sources(1,2) (ULXs) with luminosities in excess of 10(39) erg s(-1). They could be intermediate-mass black holes (more than 100-1,000 solar masses, M-circle dot) radiating at sub-maximal (sub-Eddington) rates, as in Galactic black-hole X-ray binaries but with larger, cooler accretion disks(3-5). Alternatively, they could be stellar-mass black holes radiating at Eddington or super-Eddington rates(2,6). On its discovery, M 101 ULX-1(4,7) had a luminosity of 3 x 10(39) erg s(-1) and a supersoft thermal disk spectrum with an exceptionally low temperature-uncomplicated by photons energized by a corona of hot electrons-more consistent with the expected appearance of an accreting intermediate-mass black hole(3,4). Here we report optical spectroscopic monitoring of M 101 ULX-1. We confirm the previous suggestion(8) that the system contains a Wolf-Rayet star, and reveal that the orbital period is 8.2 days. The black hole has a minimum mass of 5 M-circle dot, and more probably a mass of 20 M-circle dot-30 M-circle dot, but we argue that it is very unlikely to be an intermediate-mass black hole. Therefore, its exceptionally soft spectra at high Eddington ratios violate the expectations for accretion onto stellar-mass black holes(9-11). Accretion must occur from captured stellar wind, which has hitherto been thought to be so inefficient that it could not power an ultraluminous source(12,13).","Liu, Ji-Feng; Bregman, Joel N.; Bai, Yu; Justham, Stephen; Crowther, Paul","Liu, JF; Bregman, JN; Bai, Y; Justham, S; Crowther, P",500.0,"[Liu, Ji-Feng; Bai, Yu; Justham, Stephen] Chinese Acad Sci, Natl Astron Observ, Key Lab Opt Astron, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China; [Bregman, Joel N.] Univ Michigan, Dept Astron, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USA; [Crowther, Paul] Univ Sheffield, Dept Phys & Astron, Sheffield S3 7RH, S Yorkshire, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12762,Article,1476-4687,jfliu@nao.cas.cn,+,"NASA [PF6-70043]; Chinese Academy of Sciences [KJCX2-EW-T01]; National Science Foundation of China [NSFC-11273028, NSFC-11333004]","We thank J.

116,99,154.0,"In standard fluid dynamics(1,2), the density change associated with flow is often assumed to be negligible, implying that the fluid is incompressible. For example, this has been established for simple shear flows, where no pressure change is associated with flow: there is no volume deformation due to viscous stress and inertial effects can be neglected. Accordingly, any flow-induced instabilities ( such as cavitation) are unexpected for simple shear flows. Here we demonstrate that the incompressibility condition can be violated even for simple shear flows, by taking into account the coupling between the flow and density fluctuations, which arises owing to the density dependence of the viscosity. We show that a liquid can become mechanically unstable above a critical shear rate that is given by the inverse of the derivative of viscosity with respect to pressure. Our model predicts that, for very viscous liquids, this shear-induced instability should occur at moderate shear rates that are experimentally accessible. Our results explain the unusual shear-induced instability observed in viscous lubricants(3-5), and may illuminate other poorly understood phenomena associated with mechanical instability of liquids at low Reynolds number; for example, shear-induced cavitation and bubble growth(6), and shear-banding of very viscous liquids such as metallic glasses(7) and the Earth's mantle(8).","Furukawa, Akira; Tanaka, Hajime","Furukawa, A; Tanaka, H",434.0,"Univ Tokyo, Inst Ind Sci, Tokyo 1538505, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature05119,Article,,furu@iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp,438,,,088FY,,,POLYMER-SOLUTIONS; STRESS RHEOLOGY; HIGH-PRESSURE; LUBRICANTS; VISCOSITY; FLUCTUATIONS; STATE; TEMPERATURE; DEPENDENCE; FLUIDS,7110.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,"Tanaka, Hajime/0000-0002-4444-1890; ","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",28-Sep,5.0,LONDON,17006510.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,"Tanaka, Hajime/A-9653-2008; Furukawa, Akira/C-8629-2009","Furukawa, A (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Inst Ind Sci, 4-6-1 Komaba, Tokyo 1538505, Japan.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,26.0,Violation of the incompressibility of liquid by simple shear flow,3.0,40.0,WOS:000240798800041,154.0,443.0,Multidisciplinary Sciences,26.0,hajime,tanaka,15523.0,4.0,male,1.0,2gcE8bwAAAAJ,4.0,"(9345, 17929]",16715156,1,2070128,1
117,172,208.0,"Whisking and sniffing are predominant aspects of exploratory behaviour in rodents. Yet the neural mechanisms that generate and coordinate these and other orofacial motor patterns remain largely uncharacterized. Here we use anatomical, behavioural, electrophysiological and pharmacological tools to show that whisking and sniffing are coordinated by respiratory centres in the ventral medulla. We delineate a distinct region in the ventral medulla that provides rhythmic input to the facial motor neurons that drive protraction of the vibrissae. Neuronal output from this region is reset at each inspiration by direct input from the pre-Botzinger complex, such that high-frequency sniffing has a one-to-one relationship with whisking, whereas basal respiration is accompanied by intervening whisks that occur between breaths. We conjecture that the respiratory nuclei, which project to other premotor regions for oral and facial control, function as a master clock for behaviours that coordinate with breathing.","Moore, Jeffrey D.; Deschenes, Martin; Furuta, Takahiro; Huber, Daniel; Smear, Matthew C.; Demers, Maxime; Kleinfeld, David","Moore, JD; Deschenes, M; Furuta, T; Huber, D; Smear, MC; Demers, M; Kleinfeld, D",205.0,"[Moore, Jeffrey D.; Kleinfeld, David] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Phys, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Deschenes, Martin; Demers, Maxime] Ctr Rech Univ Laval Robert Giffard, Dept Psychiat & Neurosci, Quebec City, PQ G1J 2G3, Canada; [Furuta, Takahiro] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Morphol Brain Sci, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Huber, Daniel; Smear, Matthew C.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA; [Kleinfeld, David] Univ Calif San Diego, Neurobiol Sect, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12076,Article,,martin.deschenes@crulrg.ulaval.ca; dk@physics.ucsd.edu,+,"Canadian Institutes of Health Research [MT-5877]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (KAKENHI) [23135519, 24500409]; National Institutes of Health [NS058668, NS066664, NS047101]; US-Israeli Binational Science Foundation [2003222]","We thank A.

Sustainable management aimed at maintaining the flow of a broad range of benefits from the ocean requires a comprehensive and quantitative method to measure and monitor the health of coupled human-ocean systems. We created an index comprising ten diverse public goals for a healthy coupled human-ocean system and calculated the index for every coastal country. Globally, the overall index score was 60 out of 100 (range 36-86), with developed countries generally performing better than developing countries, but with notable exceptions. Only 5% of countries scored higher than 70, whereas 32% scored lower than 50. The index provides a powerful tool to raise public awareness, direct resource management, improve policy and prioritize scientific research.","Halpern, Benjamin S.; Longo, Catherine; Hardy, Darren; McLeod, Karen L.; Samhouri, Jameal F.; Katona, Steven K.; Kleisner, Kristin; Lester, Sarah E.; O'Leary, Jennifer; Ranelletti, Marla; Rosenberg, Andrew A.; Scarborough, Courtney; Selig, Elizabeth R.; Best, Benjamin D.; Brumbaugh, Daniel R.; Chapin, F.

119,24,106.0,"Chemical reactions inside single crystals are likely to be highly selective, but examples of single crystal to single crystal (SC-SC) transformations are uncommon, because crystallinity is difficult to retain following the rearrangement of atoms in the solid state(1-19). The most widely studied SC-SC transformations involve solvent exchange reactions in porous coordination polymers or metal-organic frameworks, which take advantage of the robust polymeric networks of the hosts(2,8,9-11). Examples of reactions occurring within molecular organic crystals generally involve photo-induced reactions, such as the coupling of alkenes or alkynes within the crystal(1,2,12-15). For nonporous molecular inorganic or organometallic crystals, single-crystal transformations involving the formation or cleavage of metal-ligand bonds are rare(17-21); known examples usually involve ligand loss from the single crystal and reversible religation, a process sometimes accompanied by decay of the single crystal to a microcrystalline powder(20,21). Here we report a series of SC-SC transformations that involve the interchange of multiple small gaseous ligands (N(2), CO, NH(3), C(2)H(4), H(2) and O(2)) at an iridium centre in molecular single crystals of a pincer Ir(I) complex. The single crystal remains intact during these ligand-exchange reactions, which occur within the crystal and do not require prior ligand extrusion. We reveal a selective catalytic transformation within a nonporous molecular crystal: pincer iridium single crystals ligated with nitrogen, ethylene or hydrogen show selective hydrogenation of ethylene relative to propylene (25:1) when surface sites are passified by CO.","Huang, Zheng; White, Peter S.; Brookhart, Maurice","Huang, Z; White, PS; Brookhart, M",598.0,"[Huang, Zheng; White, Peter S.; Brookhart, Maurice] Univ N Carolina, Dept Chem, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09085,Article,,mbrookhart@unc.edu,601,National Science Foundation under the auspices of the Centre for Enabling New Technologies through Catalysis (CENTC),This work is financially supported by the National Science Foundation under the auspices of the Centre for Enabling New Technologies through Catalysis (CENTC).,604AF,,,COORDINATION POLYMER; TRANSFER DEHYDROGENATION; PINCER COMPLEXES; IRIDIUM; TRANSFORMATION; ELIMINATION; CONVERSION; FRAMEWORK; NETWORK; BONDS,7298.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,"Huang, Zheng/0000-0001-7524-098X","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",3-Jun,4.0,LONDON,20520710.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2010.0,,"Brookhart, M (reprint author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Chem, CB 3290, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,90.0,Ligand exchanges and selective catalytic hydrogenation in molecular single crystals,11.0,144.0,WOS:000278249000037,106.0,465.0,Multidisciplinary Sciences,90.0,maurice,brookhart,14946.0,221.0,male,0.98,3mxyA2QAAAAJ,4.0,"(9345, 17929]",9447856,1,8150458,1
120,162,482.0,"The cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent catabolite repression effect in Escherichia coli is among the most intensely studied regulatory processes in biology. However, the physiological function(s) of cAMP signalling and its molecular triggers remain elusive. Here we use a quantitative physiological approach to show that cAMP signalling tightly coordinates the expression of catabolic proteins with biosynthetic and ribosomal proteins, in accordance with the cellular metabolic needs during exponential growth. The expression of carbon catabolic genes increased linearly with decreasing growth rates upon limitation of carbon influx, but decreased linearly with decreasing growth rate upon limitation of nitrogen or sulphur influx. In contrast, the expression of biosynthetic genes showed the opposite linear growth-rate dependence as the catabolic genes. A coarse-grained mathematical model provides a quantitative framework for understanding and predicting gene expression responses to catabolic and anabolic limitations. A scheme of integral feedback control featuring the inhibition of cAMP signalling by metabolic precursors is proposed and validated. These results reveal a key physiological role of cAMP-dependent catabolite repression: to ensure that proteomic resources are spent on distinct metabolic sectors as needed in different nutrient environments. Our findings underscore the power of quantitative physiology in unravelling the underlying functions of complex molecular signalling networks.","You, Conghui; Okano, Hiroyuki; Hui, Sheng; Zhang, Zhongge; Kim, Minsu; Gunderson, Carl W.; Wang, Yi-Ping; Lenz, Peter; Yan, Dalai; Hwa, Terence","You, CH; Okano, H; Hui, S; Zhang, ZG; Kim, M; Gunderson, CW; Wang, YP; Lenz, P; Yan, DL; Hwa, T",301.0,"[You, Conghui; Okano, Hiroyuki; Hui, Sheng; Kim, Minsu; Hwa, Terence] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Phys, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [You, Conghui; Okano, Hiroyuki; Zhang, Zhongge; Gunderson, Carl W.; Hwa, Terence] Univ Calif San Diego, Div Biol Sci, Sect Mol Biol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Hui, Sheng; Hwa, Terence] Univ Calif San Diego, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Wang, Yi-Ping] Peking Univ, Coll Life Sci, State Key Lab Prot & Plant Gene Res, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Lenz, Peter] Univ Marburg, Dept Phys, D-35032 Marburg, Germany; [Lenz, Peter] Univ Marburg, Ctr Synthet Microbiol, D-35032 Marburg, Germany; [Yan, Dalai] Indiana Univ Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12446,Article,,hwa@ucsd.edu,306,Human Frontiers in Science Program [RGP0022]; NSF [PHY1058793]; NSF through the Center for Theoretical Biological Physics [PHY0822283],"We are grateful to R.

123,298,477.0,"DNA methylation is a defining feature of mammalian cellular identity and is essential for normal development(1,2). Most cell types, except germ cells and pre-implantation embryos(3-5), display relatively stable DNA methylation patterns, with 70-80% of all CpGs being methylated(6). Despite recent advances, we still have a limited understanding of when, where and how many CpGs participate in genomic regulation. Here we report the in-depth analysis of 42 whole-genome bisulphite sequencing data sets across 30 diverse human cell and tissue types. We observe dynamic regulation for only 21.8% of autosomal CpGs within a normal developmental context, most of which are distal to transcription start sites. These dynamic CpGs co-localize with gene regulatory elements, particularly enhancers and transcription-factor-binding sites, which allow identification of key lineage-specific regulators. In addition, differentially methylated regions (DMRs) often contain single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with cell-type-related diseases as determined by genome-wide association studies. The results also highlight the general inefficiency of whole-genome bisulphite sequencing, as 70-80% of the sequencing reads across these data sets provided little or no relevant information about CpG methylation. To demonstrate further the utility of our DMR set, we use it to classify unknown samples and identify representative signature regions that recapitulate major DNA methylation dynamics. In summary, although in theory every CpG can change its methylation state, our results suggest that only a fraction does so as part of coordinated regulatory programs. Therefore, our selected DMRs can serve as a starting point to guide new, more effective reduced representation approaches to capture the most informative fraction of CpGs, as well as further pinpoint putative regulatory elements.","Ziller, Michael J.; Gu, Hongcang; Mueller, Fabian; Donaghey, Julie; Tsai, Linus T. -Y.; Kohlbacher, Oliver; De Jager, Philip L.; Rosen, Evan D.; Bennett, David A.; Bernstein, Bradley E.; Gnirke, Andreas; Meissner, Alexander","Ziller, MJ; Gu, HC; Muller, F; Donaghey, J; Tsai, LTY; Kohlbacher, O; De Jager, PL; Rosen, ED; Bennett, DA; Bernstein, BE; Gnirke, A; Meissner, A",477.0,"[Ziller, Michael J.; Gu, Hongcang; Donaghey, Julie; De Jager, Philip L.; Rosen, Evan D.; Bernstein, Bradley E.; Gnirke, Andreas; Meissner, Alexander] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Ziller, Michael J.; Donaghey, Julie; Meissner, Alexander] Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Ziller, Michael J.; Mueller, Fabian; Donaghey, Julie; Meissner, Alexander] Harvard Univ, Dept Stem Cell & Regenerat Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Tsai, Linus T. -Y.; Rosen, Evan D.] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Div Endocrinol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Kohlbacher, Oliver] Univ Tubingen, Ctr Bioinformat, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany; [Kohlbacher, Oliver] Univ Tubingen, Quantitat Biol Ctr, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany; [De Jager, Philip L.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Inst Neurosci, Program Translat NeuroPsychiat Genom, Dept Neurol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [De Jager, Philip L.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Inst Neurosci, Program Translat NeuroPsychiat Genom, Dept Psychiat, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Bennett, David A.] Rush Univ, Med Ctr, Rush Alzheimers Dis Ctr, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; [Bernstein, Bradley E.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02114 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12433,Article,,alexander_meissner@harvard.edu,481,"National Institutes of Health (NIH) Roadmap Epigenomics Project [ES017690]; NIH [P30AG10161, R01AG17917, R01AG15819, R01AG36042, U01ES017155, P01GM099117]; Pew Charitable Trusts; New York Stem Cell Foundation","We would like to thank K.

124,429,395.0,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are essential components of the innate immune response against intracellular bacteria and it is thought that professional phagocytes generate ROS primarily via the phagosomal NADPH oxidase machinery(1). However, recent studies have suggested that mitochondrial ROS (mROS) also contribute to mouse macrophage bactericidal activity, although the mechanisms linking innate immune signalling to mitochondria for mROS generation remain unclear(2-4). Here we demonstrate that engagement of a subset of Toll-like receptors (TLR1, TLR2 and TLR4) results in the recruitment of mitochondria to macrophage phagosomes and augments mROS production. This response involves translocation of a TLR signalling adaptor, tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), to mitochondria, where it engages the protein ECSIT (evolutionarily conserved signalling intermediate in Toll pathways), which is implicated in mitochondrial respiratory chain assembly(5). Interaction with TRAF6 leads to ECSIT ubiquitination and enrichment at the mitochondrial periphery, resulting in increased mitochondrial and cellular ROS generation. ECSIT-and TRAF6-depleted macrophages have decreased levels of TLR-induced ROS and are significantly impaired in their ability to kill intracellular bacteria. Additionally, reducing macrophage mROS levels by expressing catalase in mitochondria results in defective bacterial killing, confirming the role of mROS in bactericidal activity. These results reveal a novel pathway linking innate immune signalling to mitochondria, implicate mROS as an important component of antibacterial responses and further establish mitochondria as hubs for innate immune signalling.","West, A.

125,59,341.0,"Planar crack propagation under pure tension loading (mode I) is generally stable. However, it becomes universally unstable with the superposition of a shear stress parallel to the crack front (mode III). Under this mixed-mode (I + III) loading configuration, an initially flat parent crack segments into an array of daughter cracks that rotate towards a direction of maximum tensile stress(1). This segmentation produces stepped fracture surfaces with characteristic 'lance-shaped' markings observed in a wide range of engineering(2-7) and geological materials(1,8). The origin of this instability remains poorly understood and a theory with which to predict the surface roughness scale is lacking. Here we perform large-scale simulations of mixed-mode I + III brittle fracture using a continuum phase-field method(9-11) that describes the complete three-dimensional crack-front evolution. The simulations reveal that planar crack propagation is linearly unstable against helical deformations of the crack front, which evolve nonlinearly into a segmented array of finger-shaped daughter cracks. Furthermore, during their evolution, facets gradually coarsen owing to the growth competition of daughter cracks in striking analogy with the coarsening of finger patterns observed in nonequilibrium growth phenomena(12-14). We show that the dynamically preferred unstable wavelength is governed by the balance of the destabilizing effect of far-field stresses and the stabilizing effect of cohesive forces on the process zone scale, and we derive a theoretical estimate for this scale using a new propagation law for curved cracks in three dimensions. The rotation angles of coarsened facets are also compared to theoretical predictions and available experimental data.","Pons, Antonio J.; Karma, Alain","Pons, AJ; Karma, A",85.0,"[Pons, Antonio J.; Karma, Alain] Northeastern Univ, Dept Phys, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Pons, Antonio J.; Karma, Alain] Northeastern Univ, Ctr Interdisciplinary Res Complex Syst, Boston, MA 02115 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08862,Article,,a.karma@neu.edu,89,US DOE [DE-FG02-07ER46400]; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation;  [EX2005-0085];  [FIS2009-13360-C03-02],"We thank V.

126,211,87.0,"Non-invasive imaging deep into organs at microscopic scales remains an open quest in biomedical imaging. Although optical microscopy is still limited to surface imaging owing to optical wave diffusion and fast decorrelation in tissue, revolutionary approaches such as fluorescence photo-activated localization microscopy led to a striking increase in resolution by more than an order of magnitude in the last decade(1). In contrast with optics, ultrasonic waves propagate deep into organs without losing their coherence and are much less affected by in vivo decorrelation processes. However, their resolution is impeded by the fundamental limits of diffraction, which impose a long-standing trade-off between resolution and penetration. This limits clinical and preclinical ultrasound imaging to a sub-millimetre scale. Here we demonstrate in vivo that ultrasound imaging at ultrafast frame rates (more than 500 frames per second) provides an analogue to optical localization microscopy by capturing the transient signal decorrelation of contrast agents-inert gas microbubbles. Ultrafast ultrasound localization microscopy allowed both non-invasive sub-wavelength structural imaging and haemodynamic quantification of rodent cerebral microvessels (less than ten micrometres in diameter) more than ten millimetres below the tissue surface, leading to transcranial whole-brain imaging within short acquisition times (tens of seconds). After intravenous injection, single echoes from individual microbubbles were detected through ultrafast imaging. Their localization, not limited by diffraction, was accumulated over 75,000 images, yielding 1,000,000 events per coronal plane and statistically independent pixels of ten micrometres in size. Precise temporal tracking of microbubble positions allowed us to extract accurately in-plane velocities of the blood flow with a large dynamic range (from one millimetre per second to several centimetres per second). These results pave the way for deep non-invasive microscopy in animals and humans using ultrasound. We anticipate that ultrafast ultrasound localization microscopy may become an invaluable tool for the fundamental understanding and diagnostics of various disease processes that modify the microvascular blood flow, such as cancer, stroke and arteriosclerosis.","Errico, Claudia; Pierre, Juliette; Pezet, Sophie; Desailly, Yann; Lenkei, Zsolt; Couture, Olivier; Tanter, Mickael","Rrico, CE; Pierre, J; Pezet, S; Desailly, Y; Lenkei, Z; Couture, O; Tanter, M",499.0,"[Errico, Claudia; Pierre, Juliette; Desailly, Yann; Couture, Olivier; Tanter, Mickael] INSERM, Inst Langevin, F-75005 Paris, France; [Errico, Claudia; Pierre, Juliette; Desailly, Yann; Couture, Olivier; Tanter, Mickael] PSL Res Univ, ESPCI ParisTech, Inst Langevin, F-75005 Paris, France; [Errico, Claudia; Pierre, Juliette; Desailly, Yann; Couture, Olivier; Tanter, Mickael] CNRS, UMR 7587, F-75005 Paris, France; [Pezet, Sophie; Lenkei, Zsolt] CNRS, UMR 8249, F-75005 Paris, France; [Pezet, Sophie; Lenkei, Zsolt] PSL Res Univ, ESPCI ParisTech, Brain Plast Unit, F-75005 Paris, France",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature16066,Article,1476-4687,mickael.tanter@espci.fr,+,"Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR), within the project ANR MUSLI; Fondation Pierre-Gilles de Gennes; LABEX WIFI (Laboratory of Excellence) within the French Program ""Investments for the Future"" [ANR-10-LABX-24, ANR-10-IDEX-0001-02 PSL*]","This work was supported principally by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR), within the project ANR MUSLI.

127,167,184.0,"A prerequisite for life is the ability to maintain electrochemical imbalances across biomembranes. In all eukaryotes the plasma membrane potential and secondary transport systems are energized by the activity of P- type ATPase membrane proteins: H+-ATPase ( the proton pump) in plants and fungi(1-3), and Na+, K+-ATPase ( the sodium - potassium pump) in animals(4). The name P- type derives from the fact that these proteins exploit a phosphorylated reaction cycle intermediate of ATP hydrolysis(5). The plasma membrane proton pumps belong to the type III P- type ATPase subfamily, whereas Na+, K+-ATPase and Ca(2+-)ATPase are type II6. Electron microscopy has revealed the overall shape of proton pumps(7), however, an atomic structure has been lacking. Here we present the first structure of a P- type proton pump determined by X- ray crystallography. Ten transmembrane helices and three cytoplasmic domains define the functional unit of ATP- coupled proton transport across the plasma membrane, and the structure is locked in a functional state not previously observed in P- type ATPases. The transmembrane domain reveals a large cavity, which is likely to be filled with water, located near the middle of the membrane plane where it is lined by conserved hydrophilic and charged residues. Proton transport against a high membrane potential is readily explained by this structural arrangement.","Pedersen, Bjorn P.; Buch-Pedersen, Morten J.; Morth, J.

128,18,331.0,"Centrioles are found in the centrosome core and, as basal bodies, at the base of cilia and flagella. Centriole assembly and duplication is controlled by Polo-like-kinase 4 (Plk4): these processes fail if Plk4 is downregulated and are promoted by Plk4 overexpression(1-7). Here we show that the centriolar protein Asterless (Asl; human orthologue CEP152) provides a conserved molecular platform, the amino terminus of which interacts with the cryptic Polo box of Plk4 whereas the carboxy terminus interacts with the centriolar protein Sas-4 (CPAP in humans). Drosophila Asl and human CEP152 are required for the centrosomal loading of Plk4 in Drosophila and CPAP in human cells, respectively. Depletion of Asl or CEP152 caused failure of centrosome duplication; their overexpression led to de novo centriole formation in Drosophila eggs, duplication of free centrosomes in Drosophila embryos, and centrosome amplification in cultured Drosophila and human cells. Overexpression of a Plk4-binding-deficient mutant of Asl prevented centriole duplication in cultured cells and embryos. However, this mutant protein was able to promote microtubule organizing centre (MTOC) formation in both embryos and oocytes. Such MTOCs had pericentriolar material and the centriolar protein Sas-4, but no centrioles at their core. Formation of such acentriolar MTOCs could be phenocopied by overexpression of Sas-4 in oocytes or embryos. Our findings identify independent functions for Asl as a scaffold for Plk4 and Sas-4 that facilitates self-assembly and duplication of the centriole and organization of pericentriolar material.","Dzhindzhev, Nikola S.; Yu, Quan D.; Weiskopf, Kipp; Tzolovsky, George; Cunha-Ferreira, Ines; Riparbelli, Maria; Rodrigues-Martins, Ana; Bettencourt-Dias, Monica; Callaini, Giuliano; Glover, David M.","Dzhindzhev, NS; Yu, QAD; Weiskopf, K; Tzolovsky, G; Cunha-Ferreira, I; Riparbelli, M; Rodrigues-Martins, A; Bettencourt-Dias, M; Callaini, G; Glover, DM",714.0,"[Dzhindzhev, Nikola S.; Yu, Quan D.; Weiskopf, Kipp; Tzolovsky, George; Cunha-Ferreira, Ines; Rodrigues-Martins, Ana; Glover, David M.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Genet, Canc Res UK Cell Cycle Genet Grp, Cambridge CB2 3EH, England; [Tzolovsky, George; Riparbelli, Maria; Rodrigues-Martins, Ana; Glover, David M.] Inst Gulbenkian Ciencias, P-2780156 Oeiras, Portugal; [Riparbelli, Maria; Callaini, Giuliano] Univ Siena, Dipartimento Biol Evolut, I-53100 Siena, Italy",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09445,Article,,nsd23@cam.ac.uk; dmg25@cam.ac.uk,U104,Cancer Research UK; Fundacao Calouste Gulbenkian; Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT); Royal Society,"We thank E.

129,180,381.0,"The adoption of cereal cultivation was one of the most important cultural processes in history, marking the transition from hunting and gathering by Mesolithic foragers to the food-producing economy of Neolithic farmers(1). In the Lower Yangtze region of China, a centre of rice domestication(2), the timing and system of initial rice cultivation remain unclear. Here we report detailed evidence from Kuahuqiao that reveals the precise cultural and environmental context of rice cultivation at this earliest known Neolithic site in eastern China, 7,700 calibrated years before present (cal. yr BP). Pollen, algal, fungal spore and micro-charcoal data from sediments demonstrate that these Neolithic communities selected lowland swamps for their rice cultivation and settlement, using fire to clear alder-dominated wetland scrub and prepare the site for occupation, then to maintain wet grassland vegetation of paddy type. Regular flooding by slightly brackish water was probably controlled by 'bunding' to maintain crop yields. The site's exploitation ceased when it was overwhelmed by marine inundation 7,550 cal. yr BP. Our results establish that rice cultivation began in coastal wetlands of eastern China, an ecosystem vulnerable to coastal change but of high fertility and productivity, attractions maximized for about two centuries by sustained high levels of cultural management of the environment.","Zong, Y.; Chen, Z.; Innes, J.

130,11,195.0,"Glioblastoma is a highly angiogenetic malignancy, the neoformed vessels of which are thought to arise by sprouting of pre-existing brain capillaries. The recent demonstration that a population of glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) maintains glioblastomas(1,2) indicates that the progeny of these cells may not be confined to the neural lineage(3). Normal neural stem cells are able to differentiate into functional endothelial cells(4). The connection between neural stem cells and the endothelial compartment seems to be critical in glioblastoma, where cancer stem cells closely interact with the vascular niche and promote angiogenesis through the release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and stromal-derived factor 1 (refs 5-9). Here we show that a variable number (range 20-90%, mean 60.7%) of endothelial cells in glioblastoma carry the same genomic alteration as tumour cells, indicating that a significant portion of the vascular endothelium has a neoplastic origin. The vascular endothelium contained a subset of tumorigenic cells that produced highly vascularized anaplastic tumours with areas of vasculogenic mimicry in immunocompromised mice. In vitro culture of GSCs in endothelial conditions generated progeny with phenotypic and functional features of endothelial cells. Likewise, orthotopic or subcutaneous injection of GSCs in immunocompromised mice produced tumour xenografts, the vessels of which were primarily composed of human endothelial cells. Selective targeting of endothelial cells generated by GSCs in mouse xenografts resulted in tumour reduction and degeneration, indicating the functional relevance of the GSC-derived endothelial vessels.

131,72,431.0,"Using next-generation sequencing technology alone, we have successfully generated and assembled a draft sequence of the giant panda genome. The assembled contigs (2.25 gigabases (Gb)) cover approximately 94% of the whole genome, and the remaining gaps (0.05 Gb) seem to contain carnivore-specific repeats and tandem repeats. Comparisons with the dog and human showed that the panda genome has a lower divergence rate. The assessment of panda genes potentially underlying some of its unique traits indicated that its bamboo diet might be more dependent on its gut microbiome than its own genetic composition. We also identified more than 2.7 million heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms in the diploid genome. Our data and analyses provide a foundation for promoting mammalian genetic research, and demonstrate the feasibility for using next-generation sequencing technologies for accurate, cost-effective and rapid de novo assembly of large eukaryotic genomes.","Li, Ruiqiang;

132,307,200.0,"Marine fishes and invertebrates respond to ocean warming through distribution shifts, generally to higher latitudes and deeper waters. Consequently, fisheries should be affected by 'tropicalization' of catch(1-4) (increasing dominance of warm-water species). However, a signature of such climate-change effects on global fisheries catch has so far not been detected. Here we report such an index, the mean temperature of the catch (MTC), that is calculated from the average inferred temperature preference of exploited species weighted by their annual catch. Our results show that, after accounting for the effects of fishing and large-scale oceanographic variability, global MTC increased at a rate of 0.19 degrees Celsius per decade between 1970 and 2006, and non-tropical MTC increased at a rate of 0.23 degrees Celsius per decade. In tropical areas, MTC increased initially because of the reduction in the proportion of subtropical species catches, but subsequently stabilized as scope for further tropicalization of communities became limited. Changes in MTC in 52 large marine ecosystems, covering the majority of the world's coastal and shelf areas, are significantly and positively related to regional changes in sea surface temperature(5). This study shows that ocean warming has already affected global fisheries in the past four decades, highlighting the immediate need to develop adaptation plans to minimize the effect of such warming on the economy and food security of coastal communities, particularly in tropical regions(6,7).","Cheung, William W.

133,328,475.0,"Long-term potentiation (LTP), a well-characterized form of synaptic plasticity, has long been postulated as a cellular correlate of learning and memory. Although LTP can persist for long periods of time(1), the mechanisms underlying LTP maintenance, in the midst of ongoing protein turnover and synaptic activity, remain elusive. Sustained activation of the brain-specific protein kinase C (PKC) isoform protein kinase M-zeta (PKM-zeta) has been reported to be necessary for both LTP maintenance and long-term memory(2). Inhibiting PKM-zeta activity using a synthetic zeta inhibitory peptide (ZIP) based on the PKC-zeta pseudosubstrate sequence reverses established LTP in vitro and in vivo(3,4). More notably, infusion of ZIP eliminates memories for a growing list of experience-dependent behaviours, including active place avoidance(4), conditioned taste aversion(5), fear conditioning and spatial learning(6). However, most of the evidence supporting a role for PKM-zeta in LTP and memory relies heavily on pharmacological inhibition of PKM-zeta by ZIP. To further investigate the involvement of PKM-zeta in the maintenance of LTP and memory, we generated transgenic mice lacking PKC-zeta and PKM-zeta. We find that both conventional and conditional PKC zeta/PKM-zeta knockout mice show normal synaptic transmission and LTP at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses, and have no deficits in several hippocampal-dependent learning and memory tasks. Notably, ZIP still reverses LTP in PKC-zeta/PKM-zeta knockout mice, indicating that the effects of ZIP are independent of PKM-zeta.","Volk, Lenora J.; Bachman, Julia L.; Johnson, Richard; Yu, Yilin; Huganir, Richard L.","Volk, LJ; Bachman, JL; Johnson, R; Yu, YL; Huganir, RL",420.0,"[Volk, Lenora J.; Bachman, Julia L.; Johnson, Richard; Yu, Yilin; Huganir, Richard L.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Neurosci, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11802,Article,,rhuganir@jhmi.edu,U169,"National Institute of Health [NS36715, T32MH15330]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute","We thank G.

134,28,462.0,"The superposition of quantum states drives motion on the atomic and subatomic scales, with the energy spacing of the states dictating the speed of the motion. In the case of electrons residing in the outer (valence) shells of atoms and molecules which are separated by electronvolt energies, this means that valence electron motion occurs on a subfemtosecond to few-femtosecond timescale (1 fs = 10(-15) s). In the absence of complete measurements, the motion can be characterized in terms of a complex quantity, the density matrix. Here we report an attosecond pump-probe measurement of the density matrix of valence electrons in atomic krypton ions(1). We generate the ions with a controlled few-cycle laser field(2) and then probe them through the spectrally resolved absorption of an attosecond extreme-ultraviolet pulse(3), which allows us to observe in real time the subfemtosecond motion of valence electrons over a multifemtosecond time span. We are able to completely characterize the quantum mechanical electron motion and determine its degree of coherence in the specimen of the ensemble. Although the present study uses a simple, prototypical open system, attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy should be applicable to molecules and solid-state materials to reveal the elementary electron motions that control physical, chemical and biological properties and processes.","Goulielmakis, Eleftherios; Loh, Zhi-Heng; Wirth, Adrian; Santra, Robin; Rohringer, Nina; Yakovlev, Vladislav S.; Zherebtsov, Sergey; Pfeifer, Thomas; Azzeer, Abdallah M.; Kling, Matthias F.; Leone, Stephen R.; Krausz, Ferenc","Goulielmakis, E; Loh, ZH; Wirth, A; Santra, R; Rohringer, N; Yakovlev, VS; Zherebtsov, S; Pfeifer, T; Azzeer, AM; Kling, MF; Leone, SR; Krausz, F",739.0,"[Goulielmakis, Eleftherios; Wirth, Adrian; Yakovlev, Vladislav S.; Zherebtsov, Sergey; Kling, Matthias F.; Krausz, Ferenc] Max Planck Inst Quantum Opt, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Loh, Zhi-Heng; Pfeifer, Thomas; Leone, Stephen R.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Loh, Zhi-Heng; Pfeifer, Thomas; Leone, Stephen R.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Loh, Zhi-Heng; Pfeifer, Thomas; Leone, Stephen R.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Div Chem Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Santra, Robin] Argonne Natl Lab, Argonne, IL 60439 USA; [Santra, Robin] Univ Chicago, Dept Phys, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Rohringer, Nina] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Livermore, CA 94551 USA; [Yakovlev, Vladislav S.; Krausz, Ferenc] Univ Munich, Dept Phys, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Azzeer, Abdallah M.] King Saud Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09212,Article,,elgo@mpq.mpg.de; srl@berkeley.edu; krausz@lmu.de,U7,"Max Planck Society; King Saud University; DFG Cluster of Excellence: Munich Centre for Advanced Photonics; Marie-Curie Reintegration grant [MERG-CT-2007-208643]; DFG; Air Force Office of Scientific Research [FA9550-04-1-0242]; National Science Foundation [CHE-0742662, EEC-0310717]; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05-CH11231, DE-AC02-06CH11357]; MPG; US Department of Energy, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory [DE-AC52-07NA27344]","We thank U.

135,74,438.0,"The Red Queen(1) describes a view of nature in which species continually evolve but do not become better adapted. It is one of the more distinctive metaphors of evolutionary biology, but no test of its claim that speciation occurs at a constant rate(2) has ever been made against competing models that can predict virtually identical outcomes, nor has any mechanism been proposed that could cause the constant-rate phenomenon. Here we use 101 phylogenies of animal, plant and fungal taxa to test the constant-rate claim against four competing models. Phylogenetic branch lengths record the amount of time or evolutionary change between successive events of speciation. The models predict the distribution of these lengths by specifying how factors combine to bring about speciation, or by describing how rates of speciation vary throughout a tree. We find that the hypotheses that speciation follows the accumulation of many small events that act either multiplicatively or additively found support in 8% and none of the trees, respectively. A further 8% of trees hinted that the probability of speciation changes according to the amount of divergence from the ancestral species, and 6% suggested speciation rates vary among taxa. By comparison, 78% of the trees fit the simplest model in which new species emerge from single events, each rare but individually sufficient to cause speciation. This model predicts a constant rate of speciation, and provides a new interpretation of the Red Queen: the metaphor of species losing a race against a deteriorating environment is replaced by a view linking speciation to rare stochastic events that cause reproductive isolation. Attempts to understand species-radiations(3) or why some groups have more or fewer species should look to the size of the catalogue of potential causes of speciation shared by a group of closely related organisms rather than to how those causes combine.","Venditti, Chris; Meade, Andrew; Pagel, Mark","Venditti, C; Meade, A; Pagel, M",349.0,"[Venditti, Chris; Meade, Andrew; Pagel, Mark] Univ Reading, Sch Biol Sci, Reading RG6 6BX, Berks, England; [Pagel, Mark] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08630,Article,,m.pagel@reading.ac.uk,352,"Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), UK; Leverhulme Trust","We thank the Centre for Advanced Computing and Emerging Technologies (ACET) at the University of Reading for the use of the ThamesBlue supercomputer.

136,162,160.0,"Recent advances in measuring gene expression at the single- cell level have highlighted the stochastic nature of messenger RNA and protein synthesis(1-3). Stochastic gene expression creates a source of variability in the abundance of cellular components, even among isogenic cells exposed to an identical environment. Recent integrated experimental and modelling studies(4-13) have shed light on the molecular sources of this variability. However, many of these studies focus on systems that have reached a steady state and therefore do not address a large class of dynamic phenomena including oscillatory gene expression. Here we develop a general protocol for analysing and predicting stochastic gene expression in systems that never reach steady states. We use this framework to analyse experimentally stochastic expression of genes driven by the Synechococcus elongatus circadian clock. We find that, although the average expression at two points in the circadian cycle separated by 12 hours is identical, the variability at these two time points can be different. We show that this is a general feature of out- of- steady- state systems. We demonstrate how intrinsic noise sources, owing to random births and deaths of mRNAs and proteins, or extrinsic noise sources, which introduce fluctuations in rate constants, affect the cell- to- cell variability. To distinguish experimentally between these sources, we measured how the correlation between expression fluctuations of two identical genes is modulated during the circadian cycle. This quantitative framework is generally applicable to any out- of steady state system and will be necessary for understanding the fidelity of dynamic cellular systems.","Chabot, Jeffrey R.; Pedraza, Juan M.; Luitel, Prashant; van Oudenaarden, Alexander","Chabot, JR; Pedraza, JM; Luitel, P; van Oudenaarden, A",1249.0,"MIT, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; MIT, George R Harrison Spect Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06395,Article,,avano@mit.edu,1252,,,243HA,,,SINGLE-CELL; PROTEIN EXPRESSION; NOISE; RHYTHMS; VARIABILITY; NETWORKS; LUCIFERASE; REPORTER; ORIGINS; LEVEL,7173.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",20-Dec,4.0,LONDON,18097413.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007.0,,"van Oudenaarden, A (reprint author), MIT, Dept Phys, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,71.0,Stochastic gene expression out-of-steady-state in the cyanobacterial circadian clock,1.0,9.0,WOS:000251786200054,160.0,450.0,Multidisciplinary Sciences,72.0,alexander,van oudenaarden,26343.0,1645.0,male,1.0,pxkP0GQAAAAJ,5.0,"(17929, ]",17509366,1,17509366,1
137,88,83.0,"Lambda-like double-stranded (ds) DNA bacteriophage undergo massive conformational changes in their capsid shell during the packaging of their viral genomes. Capsid shells are complex organizations of hundreds of protein subunits that assemble into intricate quaternary complexes that ultimately are able to withstand over 50 atm of pressure during genome packaging(1). The extensive integration between subunits in capsids requires the formation of an intermediate complex, termed a procapsid, from which individual subunits can undergo the necessary refolding and structural rearrangements needed to transition to the more stable capsid. Although various mature capsids have been characterized at atomic resolution, no such procapsid structure is available for a dsDNA virus or bacteriophage. Here we present a procapsid X-ray structure at 3.65 angstrom resolution, termed prohead II, of the lambda-like bacteriophage HK97, the mature capsid structure of which was previously solved to 3.44 angstrom (ref. 2). A comparison of the two largely different capsid forms has unveiled an unprecedented expansion mechanism that describes the transition. Crystallographic and hydrogen/deuterium exchange data presented here demonstrate that the subunit tertiary structures are significantly different between the two states, with twisting and bending motions occurring in both helical and beta-sheet regions. We also identified subunit interactions at each three-fold axis of the capsid that are maintained throughout maturation. The interactions sustain capsid integrity during subunit refolding and provide a fixed hinge from which subunits undergo rotational and translational motions during maturation. Previously published calorimetric data of a closely related bacteriophage, P22, showed that capsid maturation was an exothermic process that resulted in a release of 90 kJ mol(-1) of energy(3). We propose that the major tertiary changes presented in this study reveal a structural basis for an exothermic maturation process probably present in many dsDNA bacteriophage and possibly viruses such as herpesvirus, which share the HK97 subunit fold(4).","Gertsman, Ilya; Gan, Lu; Guttman, Miklos; Lee, Kelly; Speir, Jeffrey A.; Duda, Robert L.; Hendrix, Roger W.; Komives, Elizabeth A.; Johnson, John E.","Gertsman, I; Gan, L; Guttman, M; Lee, K; Speir, JA; Duda, RL; Hendrix, RW; Komives, EA; Johnson, JE",646.0,"[Gertsman, Ilya; Gan, Lu; Lee, Kelly; Speir, Jeffrey A.; Johnson, John E.] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Gertsman, Ilya; Guttman, Miklos; Komives, Elizabeth A.; Johnson, John E.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Chem & Biochem, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Duda, Robert L.; Hendrix, Roger W.] Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Bacteriophage Inst, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Duda, Robert L.; Hendrix, Roger W.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07686,Article,,jackj@scripps.edu,U114,"NIH [RO1 AI40101, RO1 GM47795]; NIH Training Grant [GM08326]","We thank V.

138,205,2.0,"Nitrification, the oxidation of ammonia via nitrite to nitrate, has always been considered to be a two-step process catalysed by chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms oxidizing either ammonia or nitrite. No known nitrifier carries out both steps, although complete nitrification should be energetically advantageous. This functional separation has puzzled microbiologists for a century. Here we report on the discovery and cultivation of a completely nitrifying bacterium from the genus Nitrospira, a globally distributed group of nitrite oxidizers. The genome of this chemolithoautotrophic organism encodes the pathways both for ammonia and nitrite oxidation, which are concomitantly expressed during growth by ammonia oxidation to nitrate. Genes affiliated with the phylogenetically distinct ammonia monooxygenase and hydroxylamine dehydrogenase genes of Nitrospira are present in many environments and were retrieved on Nitrospira-contigs in new metagenomes from engineered systems. These findings fundamentally change our picture of nitrification and point to completely nitrifying Nitrospira as key components of nitrogen-cycling microbial communities.","Daims, Holger; Lebedeva, Elena V.; Pjevac, Petra; Han, Ping; Herbold, Craig; Albertsen, Mads; Jehmlich, Nico; Palatinszky, Marton; Vierheilig, Julia; Bulaev, Alexandr; Kirkegaard, Rasmus H.; von Bergen, Martin; Rattei, Thomas; Bendinger, Bernd; Nielsen, Per H.; Wagner, Michael","Daims, H; Lebedeva, EV; Pjevac, P; Han, P; Herbold, C; Albertsen, M; Jehmlich, N; Palatinszky, M; Vierheilig, J; Bulaev, A; Kirkegaard, RH; von Bergen, M; Rattei, T; Bendinger, B; Nielsen, PH; Wagner, M",504.0,"[Daims, Holger; Pjevac, Petra; Han, Ping; Herbold, Craig; Palatinszky, Marton; Vierheilig, Julia; Wagner, Michael] Univ Vienna, Div Microbial Ecol, Dept Microbiol & Ecosyst Sci, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Lebedeva, Elena V.; Bulaev, Alexandr] Russian Acad Sci, Biotechnol Res Ctr, Winogradsky Inst Microbiol, Moscow 119071, Russia; [Albertsen, Mads; Kirkegaard, Rasmus H.; Nielsen, Per H.] Aalborg Univ, Dept Chem & Biosci, Ctr Microbial Communities, DK-9220 Aalborg, Denmark; [Jehmlich, Nico; von Bergen, Martin] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Prote, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [von Bergen, Martin] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Metabol, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Rattei, Thomas] Univ Vienna, Div Computat Syst Biol, Dept Microbiol & Ecosyst Sci, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Bendinger, Bernd] Hamburg Univ Technol, DVGW Forsch Stelle TUHH, D-21073 Hamburg, Germany",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature16461,Article,1476-4687,wagner@microbial-ecology.net,+,"European Regional Development Funds (EFRE-Europe funds Saxony); Helmholtz Association; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P27319-B21, P25231-B21]; European Research Council Advanced Grant [NITRICARE 294343]; Danish Council for Independent Research [DFF-4005-00369]; Innovation Fund Denmark (EcoDesign)","We thank T.

139,40,156.0,"Interactions lie at the heart of correlated many-body quantum phases(1-3). Typically, the interactions between microscopic particles are described as two-body interactions. However, it has been shown that higher-order multi-body interactions could give rise to novel quantum phases with intriguing properties. So far, multi-body interactions have been observed as inelastic loss resonances in three-and four-body recombinations of atom-atom and atom-molecule collisions(4-6). Here we demonstrate the presence of effective multi-body interactions(7) in a system of ultracold bosonic atoms in a three-dimensional optical lattice, emerging through virtual transitions of particles from the lowest energy band to higher energy bands. We observe such interactions up to the six-body case in time-resolved traces of quantum phase revivals(8-11), using an atom interferometric technique that allows us to precisely measure the absolute energies of atom number states at a lattice site. In addition, we show that the spectral content of these time traces can reveal the atom number statistics at a lattice site, similar to foundational experiments in cavity quantum electrodynamics that yield the statistics of a cavity photon field(12). Our precision measurement of multi-body interaction energies provides crucial input for the comparison of optical-lattice quantum simulators with many-body quantum theory.","Will, Sebastian; Best, Thorsten; Schneider, Ulrich; Hackermueller, Lucia; Luehmann, Dirk-Soeren; Bloch, Immanuel","Will, S; Best, T; Schneider, U; Hackermuller, L; Luhmann, DS; Bloch, I",197.0,"[Will, Sebastian; Best, Thorsten; Schneider, Ulrich; Hackermueller, Lucia; Bloch, Immanuel] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Phys, D-55099 Mainz, Germany; [Will, Sebastian; Schneider, Ulrich; Bloch, Immanuel] Univ Munich, Fac Phys, D-80799 Munich, Germany; [Luehmann, Dirk-Soeren] Univ Hamburg, Inst Theoret Phys, D-20355 Hamburg, Germany; [Bloch, Immanuel] Max Planck Inst Quantum Opt, D-85748 Garching, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09036,Article,,sebastian.will@lmu.de,201,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; European Union, EuroQUAM; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency; US Air Force Office of Scientific Research, MATCOR; Gutenberg Akademie","This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, the European Union (Integrated Project SCALA), EuroQUAM (L.

140,413,164.0,"Global warming is predicted to induce desiccation in many world regions through increases in evaporative demand(1-3). Rising CO2 may counter that trend by improving plant water-use efficiency(4,5). However, it is not clear how important this CO2-enhanced water use efficiency might be in offsetting warming-induced desiccation because higher CO2 also leads to higher plant biomass, and therefore greater transpirational surface(2,6,7). Furthermore, although warming is predicted to favour warm-season, C-4 grasses, rising CO2 should favour C-3, or cool-season plants(8). Here we show in a semi-arid grassland that elevated CO2 can completely reverse the desiccating effects of moderate warming. Although enrichment of air to 600 p. p. m. v. CO2 increased soil water content (SWC), 1.5/3.0 degrees C day/night warming resulted in desiccation, such that combined CO2 enrichment and warming had no effect on SWC relative to control plots. As predicted, elevated CO2 favoured C-3 grasses and enhanced stand productivity, whereas warming favoured C-4 grasses. Combined warming and CO2 enrichment stimulated above-ground growth of C-4 grasses in 2 of 3 years when soil moisture most limited plant productivity. The results indicate that in a warmer, CO2-enriched world, both SWC and productivity in semi-arid grasslands may be higher than previously expected.","Morgan, Jack A.; LeCain, Daniel R.; Pendall, Elise; Blumenthal, Dana M.; Kimball, Bruce A.; Carrillo, Yolima; Williams, David G.; Heisler-White, Jana; Dijkstra, Feike A.; West, Mark","Morgan, JA; LeCain, DR; Pendall, E; Blumenthal, DM; Kimball, BA; Carrillo, Y; Williams, DG; Heisler-White, J; Dijkstra, FA; West, M",202.0,"[Morgan, Jack A.; LeCain, Daniel R.; Blumenthal, Dana M.; Dijkstra, Feike A.; West, Mark] USDA ARS, Rangeland Resources Res Unit, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; [Morgan, Jack A.; LeCain, Daniel R.; Blumenthal, Dana M.; Dijkstra, Feike A.; West, Mark] USDA ARS, No Plains Area, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; [Pendall, Elise; Carrillo, Yolima; Williams, David G.; Heisler-White, Jana] Univ Wyoming, Dept Bot, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Pendall, Elise; Carrillo, Yolima; Williams, David G.; Heisler-White, Jana] Univ Wyoming, Program Ecol, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Kimball, Bruce A.] ARS, US Arid Land Agr Res Ctr, USDA, Maricopa, AZ 85238 USA; [Dijkstra, Feike A.] Univ Sydney, Fac Agr Food & Nat Resources, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10274,Article,,jack.morgan@ars.usda.gov,U101,"US Department of Agriculture; US Department of Agriculture-Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service [2008-35107-18655]; US Department of Energy's Office of Science (Biological and Environmental Research) through the Western Regional Center of the National Institute for Climatic Change Research at Northern Arizona University; National Science Foundation [1021559]","We thank D.

141,114,499.0,"In yeast, the transcription factor Crz1 is dephosphorylated and translocates into the nucleus in response to extracellular calcium. Here we show, using time- lapse microscopy, that Crz1 exhibits short bursts of nuclear localization ( typically lasting 2 min) that occur stochastically in individual cells and propagate to the expression of downstream genes. Strikingly, calcium concentration controls the frequency, but not the duration, of localization bursts. Using an analytic model, we also show that this frequency modulation of bursts ensures proportional expression of multiple target genes across a wide dynamic range of expression levels, independent of promoter characteristics. We experimentally confirm this theory with natural and synthetic Crz1 target promoters. Another stress- response transcription factor, Msn2, exhibits similar, but largely uncorrelated, localization bursts under calcium stress suggesting that frequency- modulation regulation of localization bursts may be a general control strategy used by the cell to coordinate multi- gene responses to external signals.","Cai, Long; Dalal, Chiraj K.; Elowitz, Michael B.","Cai, L; Dalal, CK; Elowitz, MB",485.0,"[Cai, Long; Dalal, Chiraj K.; Elowitz, Michael B.] CALTECH, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Div Biol, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Cai, Long; Dalal, Chiraj K.; Elowitz, Michael B.] CALTECH, Dept Appl Phys, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07292,Article,,melowitz@caltech.edu,U16,"Beckman Fellows Program at Caltech; National Institutes of Health [R01GM079771]; National Centers of Systems Biology, and the Packard Foundation [P50 GM068763]","We thank M.

142,52,287.0,"Domestic animals are excellent models for genetic studies of phenotypic evolution(1-3). They have evolved genetic adaptations to a new environment, the farm, and have been subjected to strong human-driven selection leading to remarkable phenotypic changes in morphology, physiology and behaviour. Identifying the genetic changes underlying these developments provides new insight into general mechanisms by which genetic variation shapes phenotypic diversity. Here we describe the use of massively parallel sequencing to identify selective sweeps of favourable alleles and candidate mutations that have had a prominent role in the domestication of chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) and their subsequent specialization into broiler (meat-producing) and layer (egg-producing) chickens. We have generated 44.5-fold coverage of the chicken genome using pools of genomic DNA representing eight different populations of domestic chickens as well as red jungle fowl (Gallus gallus), the major wild ancestor(4). We report more than 7,000,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms, almost 1,300 deletions and a number of putative selective sweeps. One of the most striking selective sweeps found in all domestic chickens occurred at the locus for thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR), which has a pivotal role in metabolic regulation and photoperiod control of reproduction in vertebrates. Several of the selective sweeps detected in broilers overlapped genes associated with growth, appetite and metabolic regulation. We found little evidence that selection for loss-of-function mutations had a prominent role in chicken domestication, but we detected two deletions in coding sequences that we suggest are functionally important. This study has direct application to animal breeding and enhances the importance of the domestic chicken as a model organism for biomedical research.","Rubin, Carl-Johan; Zody, Michael C.; Eriksson, Jonas; Meadows, Jennifer R.

143,276,86.0,"Although it is generally agreed that the Arctic flora is among the youngest and least diverse on Earth, the processes that shaped it are poorly understood. Here we present 50 thousand years (kyr) of Arctic vegetation history, derived from the first large-scale ancient DNA metabarcoding study of circumpolar plant diversity. For this interval we also explore nematode diversity as a proxy for modelling vegetation cover and soil quality, and diets of herbivorous megafaunal mammals, many of which became extinct around 10 kyr BP (before present). For much of the period investigated, Arctic vegetation consisted of dry steppe-tundra dominated by forbs (non-graminoid herbaceous vascular plants). During the Last Glacial Maximum (25-15 kyr BP), diversity declined markedly, although forbs remained dominant. Much changed after 10 kyr BP, with the appearance of moist tundra dominated by woody plants and graminoids. Our analyses indicate that both graminoids and forbs would have featured in megafaunal diets. As such, our findings question the predominance of a Late Quaternary graminoid-dominated Arctic mammoth steppe.","Willerslev, Eske; Davison, John; Moora, Mari; Zobel, Martin; Coissac, Eric; Edwards, Mary E.; Lorenzen, Eline D.; Vestergard, Mette; Gussarova, Galina; Haile, James; Craine, Joseph; Gielly, Ludovic; Boessenkool, Sanne; Epp, Laura S.; Pearman, Peter B.; Cheddadi, Rachid; Murray, David; Brathen, Kari Anne; Yoccoz, Nigel; Binney, Heather; Cruaud, Corinne; Wincker, Patrick; Goslar, Tomasz; Alsos, Inger Greve; Bellemain, Eva; Brysting, Anne Krag; Elven, Reidar; Sonstebo, Jorn Henrik; Murton, Julian; Sher, Andrei; Rasmussen, Morten; Ronn, Regin; Mourier, Tobias; Cooper, Alan; Austin, Jeremy; Moller, Per; Froese, Duane; Zazula, Grant; Pompanon, Franois; Rioux, Delphine; Niderkorn, Vincent; Tikhonov, Alexei; Savvinov, Grigoriy; Roberts, Richard G.; MacPhee, Ross D.

The complex origins of impulsivity hinder identification of the genes influencing it and the diseases with which it is associated. Here we perform exon-focused sequencing of impulsive individuals in a founder population, targeting fourteen genes belonging to the serotonin and dopamine domain. A stop codon in HTR2B was identified that is common (minor allele frequency >1%) but exclusive to Finnish people. Expression of the gene in the human brain was assessed, as well as the molecular functionality of the stop codon, which was associated with psychiatric diseases marked by impulsivity in both population and family-based analyses. Knockout of Htr2b increased impulsive behaviours in mice, indicative of predictive validity. Our study shows the potential for identifying and tracing effects of rare alleles in complex behavioural phenotypes using founder populations, and indicates a role for HTR2B in impulsivity.","Bevilacqua, Laura; Doly, Stephane; Kaprio, Jaakko; Yuan, Qiaoping; Tikkanen, Roope; Paunio, Tiina; Zhou, Zhifeng; Wedenoja, Juho; Maroteaux, Luc; Diaz, Silvina; Belmer, Arnaud; Hodgkinson, Colin A.; Dell'Osso, Liliana; Suvisaari, Jaana; Coccaro, Emil; Rose, Richard J.; Peltonen, Leena; Virkkunen, Matti; Goldman, David","Bevilacqua, L; Doly, S; Kaprio, J; Yuan, QP; Tikkanen, R; Paunio, T; Zhou, ZF; Wedenoja, J; Maroteaux, L; Diaz, S; Belmer, A; Hodgkinson, CA; Dell'Osso, L; Suvisaari, J; Coccaro, E; Rose, RJ; Peltonen, L; Virkkunen, M; Goldman, D",1061.0,"[Bevilacqua, Laura; Yuan, Qiaoping; Zhou, Zhifeng; Hodgkinson, Colin A.; Goldman, David] NIAAA, Neurogenet Lab, NIH, Rockville, MD 20852 USA; [Doly, Stephane; Maroteaux, Luc; Diaz, Silvina; Belmer, Arnaud] INSERM, UMR S 839, F-75654 Paris, France; [Doly, Stephane; Maroteaux, Luc; Diaz, Silvina; Belmer, Arnaud] Univ Paris 06, Inst du Fer Moulin, F-75654 Paris, France; [Kaprio, Jaakko] Univ Helsinki, Dept Publ Hlth, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Kaprio, Jaakko] Inst Mol Med, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Kaprio, Jaakko] Natl Inst Hlth & Welf, Unit Child & Adolescent Psychiat, FI-00271 Helsinki, Finland; [Tikkanen, Roope; Virkkunen, Matti] Univ Helsinki, Inst Clin Med, Dept Psychiat, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Paunio, Tiina; Suvisaari, Jaana] Univ Helsinki, Dept Psychiat, Cent Hosp, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Wedenoja, Juho] Univ Helsinki, Dept Med Genet, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Wedenoja, Juho] Univ Helsinki, Inst Mol Med Finland, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Wedenoja, Juho] Natl Inst Hlth & Welf, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Dell'Osso, Liliana] Univ Pisa, Dept Psychiat, I-56100 Pisa, Italy; [Coccaro, Emil] Univ Chicago, Pritzker Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Rose, Richard J.] Indiana Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Virkkunen, Matti] Kellokoski Psychiat Hosp, FI-04500 Kellokoski, Finland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09629,Article,,davidgoldman@mail.nih.gov,U460,"National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, NIH; Academy of Finland Centre of Excellence in Complex Disease Genetics; National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism [AA-12502, AA-09203]; Academy of Finland [100499, 205585, 118555]; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale; Universite Pierre et Marie Curie; Fondation de France; Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale; French Ministry of Research (Agence Nationale pour la Recherche); European Union; IBRO; Region Ile de France DIM STEM","This study is dedicated to the memory of L.P. and M.

145,45,222.0,"Snakes possess a unique sensory system for detecting infrared radiation, enabling them to generate a 'thermal image' of predators or prey. Infrared signals are initially received by the pit organ, a highly specialized facial structure that is innervated by nerve fibres of the somatosensory system. How this organ detects and transduces infrared signals into nerve impulses is not known. Here we use an unbiased transcriptional profiling approach to identify TRPA1 channels as infrared receptors on sensory nerve fibres that innervate the pit organ. TRPA1 orthologues from pit-bearing snakes (vipers, pythons and boas) are the most heat-sensitive vertebrate ion channels thus far identified, consistent with their role as primary transducers of infrared stimuli. Thus, snakes detect infrared signals through a mechanism involving radiant heating of the pit organ, rather than photochemical transduction. These findings illustrate the broad evolutionary tuning of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels as thermosensors in the vertebrate nervous system.","Gracheva, Elena O.; Ingolia, Nicholas T.; Kelly, Yvonne M.; Cordero-Morales, Julio F.; Hollopeter, Gunther; Chesler, Alexander T.; Sanchez, Elda E.; Perez, John C.; Weissman, Jonathan S.; Julius, David","Gracheva, EO; Ingolia, NT; Kelly, YM; Cordero-Morales, JF; Hollopeter, G; Chesler, AT; Sanchez, EE; Perez, JC; Weissman, JS; Julius, D",1006.0,"[Gracheva, Elena O.; Kelly, Yvonne M.; Cordero-Morales, Julio F.; Hollopeter, Gunther; Chesler, Alexander T.; Julius, David] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Physiol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Ingolia, Nicholas T.; Weissman, Jonathan S.; Julius, David] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Cellular & Mol Pharmacol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Ingolia, Nicholas T.; Weissman, Jonathan S.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Ingolia, Nicholas T.; Weissman, Jonathan S.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Calif Inst Quantitat Biosci, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Sanchez, Elda E.; Perez, John C.] Texas A&M Univ, Nat Toxins Res Ctr, Kingsville, TX 78363 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08943,Article,,julius@cmp.ucsf.edu,U66,"Ruth L.

146,425,310.0,"Type 1 pili are the archetypal representative of a widespread class of adhesive multisubunit fibres in Gram-negative bacteria. During pilus assembly, subunits dock as chaperone-bound complexes to an usher, which catalyses their polymerization and mediates pilus translocation across the outer membrane. Here we report the crystal structure of the full-length FimD usher bound to the FimC-FimH chaperone-adhesin complex and that of the unbound form of the FimD translocation domain. The FimD-FimC-FimH structure shows FimH inserted inside the FimD 24-stranded beta-barrel translocation channel. FimC-FimH is held in place through interactions with the two carboxy-terminal periplasmic domains of FimD, a binding mode confirmed in solution by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. To accommodate FimH, the usher plug domain is displaced from the barrel lumen to the periplasm, concomitant with a marked conformational change in the beta-barrel. The amino-terminal domain of FimD is observed in an ideal position to catalyse incorporation of a newly recruited chaperone-subunit complex. The FimD-FimC-FimH structure provides unique insights into the pilus subunit incorporation cycle, and captures the first view of a protein transporter in the act of secreting its cognate substrate.","Phan, Gilles; Remaut, Han; Wang, Tao; Allen, William J.; Pirker, Katharina F.; Lebedev, Andrey; Henderson, Nadine S.; Geibel, Sebastian; Volkan, Ender; Yan, Jun; Kunze, Micha B.

147,118,62.0,"Motility is a universal property of newly generated neurons. How cell migration is coordinately regulated with other aspects of neuron production is not well understood. Here we show that the proneural protein neurogenin 2 ( Neurog2), which controls neurogenesis in the embryonic cerebral cortex(1,2), directly induces the expression of the small GTP- binding protein Rnd2 ( ref. 3) in newly generated mouse cortical neurons before they initiate migration. Rnd2 silencing leads to a defect in radial migration of cortical neurons similar to that observed when the Neurog2 gene is deleted. Remarkably, restoring Rnd2 expression in Neurog2- mutant neurons is sufficient to rescue their ability to migrate. Our results identify Rnd2 as a novel essential regulator of neuronal migration in the cerebral cortex and demonstrate that Rnd2 is a major effector of Neurog2 function in the promotion of migration. Thus, a proneural protein controls the complex cellular behaviour of cell migration through a remarkably direct pathway involving the transcriptional activation of a small GTP- binding protein.","Heng, Julian Ik-Tsen; Nguyen, Laurent; Castro, Diogo S.; Zimmer, Celine; Wildner, Hendrik; Armant, Olivier; Skowronska-Krawczyk, Dorota; Bedogni, Francesco; Matter, Jean-Marc; Hevner, Robert; Guillemot, Francois","Heng, JIT; Nguyen, L; Castro, DS; Zimmer, C; Wildner, H; Armant, O; Skowronska-Krawczyk, D; Bedogni, F; Matter, JM; Hevner, R; Guillemot, F",114.0,"[Heng, Julian Ik-Tsen; Nguyen, Laurent; Castro, Diogo S.; Zimmer, Celine; Wildner, Hendrik; Armant, Olivier; Guillemot, Francois] Natl Inst Med Res, Div Mol Neurobiol, London NW7 1AA, England; [Skowronska-Krawczyk, Dorota; Matter, Jean-Marc] Univ Geneva, Dept Biochem, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland; [Bedogni, Francesco; Hevner, Robert] Univ Washington, Harborview Med Ctr, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Seattle, WA 98104 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07198,Article,,fguille@nimr.mrc.ac.uk,U82,Australian CJ Martin Fellowship [310616]; Medical Research Council career development fellowship; European Molecular Biology Organization; Medical Research Council career development fellowships; European Commission 6th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development; Medical Research Council,"We are grateful to S.

148,101,288.0,"Fossils of organisms dating from the origin and diversification of cellular life are scant and difficult to interpret(1), for this reason alternative means to investigate the ecology of the last universal common ancestor ( LUCA) and of the ancestors of the three domains of life are of great scientific value. It was recently recognized that the effects of temperature on ancestral organisms left 'genetic footprints' that could be uncovered in extant genomes(2-4). Accordingly, analyses of resurrected proteins predicted that the bacterial ancestor was thermophilic and that Bacteria subsequently adapted to lower temperatures(3,4). As the archaeal ancestor is also thought to have been thermophilic(5), the LUCA was parsimoniously inferred as thermophilic too. However, an analysis of ribosomal RNAs supported the hypothesis of a non- hyperthermophilic LUCA(2). Here we show that both rRNA and protein sequences analysed with advanced, realistic models of molecular evolution(6,7) provide independent support for two environmental- temperature-related phases during the evolutionary history of the tree of life. In the first period, thermotolerance increased from a mesophilic LUCA to thermophilic ancestors of Bacteria and of Archaea Eukaryota; in the second period, it decreased. Therefore, the two lineages descending from the LUCA and leading to the ancestors of Bacteria and Archaea - Eukaryota convergently adapted to high temperatures, possibly in response to a climate change of the early Earth(1,8,9), and/or aided by the transition from an RNA genome in the LUCA to organisms with more thermostable DNA genomes(10,11). This analysis unifies apparently contradictory results(2-4) into a coherent depiction of the evolution of an ecological trait over the entire tree of life.","Boussau, Bastien; Blanquart, Samuel; Necsulea, Anamaria; Lartillot, Nicolas; Gouy, Manolo","Boussau, B; Blanquart, S; Necsulea, A; Lartillot, N; Gouy, M",942.0,"[Boussau, Bastien; Necsulea, Anamaria; Gouy, Manolo] Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, Lab Biometrie & Biol Evolut, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France; [Blanquart, Samuel; Lartillot, Nicolas] CNRS, LIRMM, F-34392 Montpellier, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07393,Article,,mgouy@biomserv.univ-lyon1.fr,U74,Action Concertee Incitative IMPBIO-MODELPHYLO; ANR PlasmoExplore,"This work was supported by Action Concertee Incitative IMPBIO-MODELPHYLO and ANR PlasmoExplore.

149,268,472.0,"As the concentrations of highly consumed nutrients, particularly glucose, are generally lower in tumours than in normal tissues(1,2), cancer cells must adapt their metabolism to the tumour microenvironment. Abetter understanding of these adaptations might reveal cancer cell liabilities that can be exploited for therapeutic benefit. Here we developed a continuous-flow culture apparatus (Nutrostat) for maintaining proliferating cells in low-nutrient media for long periods of time, and used it to undertake competitive proliferation assays on a pooled collection of barcoded cancer cell lines cultured in low-glucose conditions. Sensitivity to low glucose varies amongst cell lines, and an RNA interference (RNAi) screen pinpointed mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) as the major pathway required for optimal proliferation in low glucose. We found that cell lines most sensitive to low glucose are defective in the OXPHOS upregulation that is normally caused by glucose limitation as a result of either mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations in complex I genes or impaired glucose utilization. These defects predict sensitivity to biguanides, antidiabetic drugs that inhibit OXPHOS3,4, when cancer cells are grown in low glucose or as tumour xenografts. Notably, the biguanide sensitivity of cancer cells with mtDNA mutations was reversed by ectopic expression of yeast NDI1, a ubiquinone oxidoreductase that allows bypass of complex I function(5). Thus, we conclude that mtDNA mutations and impaired glucose utilization are potential biomarkers for identifying tumours with increased sensitivity to OXPHOS inhibitors.","Birsoy, Kivanc; Possemato, Richard; Lorbeer, Franziska K.; Bayraktar, Erol C.; Thiru, Prathapan; Yucel, Burcu; Wang, Tim; Chen, Walter W.; Clish, Clary B.; Sabatini, David M.","Birsoy, K; Possemato, R; Lorbeer, FK; Bayraktar, EC; Thiru, P; Yucel, B; Wang, T; Chen, WW; Clish, CB; Sabatini, DM",108.0,"[Birsoy, Kivanc; Possemato, Richard; Lorbeer, Franziska K.; Bayraktar, Erol C.; Thiru, Prathapan; Yucel, Burcu; Wang, Tim; Chen, Walter W.; Clish, Clary B.; Sabatini, David M.] Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Birsoy, Kivanc; Possemato, Richard; Wang, Tim; Chen, Walter W.; Sabatini, David M.] MIT, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Birsoy, Kivanc; Possemato, Richard; Wang, Tim; Chen, Walter W.; Sabatini, David M.] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Birsoy, Kivanc; Possemato, Richard; Wang, Tim; Chen, Walter W.; Clish, Clary B.; Sabatini, David M.] Broad Inst Harvard & MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Birsoy, Kivanc; Possemato, Richard; Wang, Tim; Chen, Walter W.; Sabatini, David M.] MIT, David H Koch Inst Integrat Canc Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13110,Article,1476-4687,sabatini@wi.mit.edu,+,"Leukemia and Lymphoma Society; Jane Coffin Childs Fund; Council of Higher Education Turkey; Karadeniz T.

150,431,402.0,"Understanding exotic forms of magnetism in quantum mechanical systems is a central goal of modern condensed matter physics, with implications for systems ranging from high-temperature superconductors to spintronic devices. Simulating magnetic materials in the vicinity of a quantum phase transition is computationally intractable on classical computers, owing to the extreme complexity arising from quantum entanglement between the constituent magnetic spins. Here we use a degenerate Bose gas of rubidium atoms confined in an optical lattice to simulate a chain of interacting quantum Ising spins as they undergo a phase transition. Strong spin interactions are achieved through a site-occupation to pseudo-spin mapping. As we vary a magnetic field, quantum fluctuations drive a phase transition from a paramagnetic phase into an antiferromagnetic phase. In the paramagnetic phase, the interaction between the spins is overwhelmed by the applied field, which aligns the spins. In the antiferromagnetic phase, the interaction dominates and produces staggered magnetic ordering. Magnetic domain formation is observed through both in situ site-resolved imaging and noise correlation measurements. By demonstrating a route to quantum magnetism in an optical lattice, this work should facilitate further investigations of magnetic models using ultracold atoms, thereby improving our understanding of real magnetic materials.","Simon, Jonathan; Bakr, Waseem S.; Ma, Ruichao; Tai, M.

151,380,79.0,"The mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) kinase nucleates a pathway that promotes cell growth and proliferation and is the target of rapamycin, a drug with many clinical uses(1). mTORC1 regulates messenger RNA translation, but the overall translational program is poorly defined and no unifying model exists to explain how mTORC1 differentially controls the translation of specific mRNAs. Here we use high-resolution transcriptome-scale ribosome profiling to monitor translation in mouse cells acutely treated with the mTOR inhibitor Torin 1, which, unlike rapamycin, fully inhibits mTORC1 (ref. 2). Our data reveal a surprisingly simple model of the mRNA features and mechanisms that confer mTORC1-dependent translation control. The subset of mRNAs that are specifically regulated by mTORC1 consists almost entirely of transcripts with established 5' terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) motifs, or, like Hsp90ab1 and Ybx1, with previously unrecognized TOP or related TOP-like motifs that we identified. We find no evidence to support proposals that mTORC1 preferentially regulates mRNAs with increased 5' untranslated region length or complexity(3). mTORC1 phosphorylates a myriad of translational regulators, but how it controls TOP mRNA translation is unknown(4). Remarkably, loss of just the 4E-BP family of translational repressors, arguably the best characterized mTORC1 substrates, is sufficient to render TOP and TOP-like mRNA translation resistant to Torin 1. The 4E-BPs inhibit translation initiation by interfering with the interaction between the cap-binding protein eIF4E and eIF4G1. Loss of this interaction diminishes the capacity of eIF4E to bind TOP and TOP-like mRNAs much more than other mRNAs, explaining why mTOR inhibition selectively suppresses their translation. Our results clarify the translational program controlled by mTORC1 and identify 4E-BPs and eIF4G1 as its master effectors.","Thoreen, Carson C.; Chantranupong, Lynne; Keys, Heather R.; Wang, Tim; Gray, Nathanael S.; Sabatini, David M.","Thoreen, CC; Chantranupong, L; Keys, HR; Wang, T; Gray, NS; Sabatini, DM",109.0,"[Thoreen, Carson C.; Gray, Nathanael S.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Thoreen, Carson C.; Gray, Nathanael S.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem & Mol Pharmacol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Thoreen, Carson C.; Chantranupong, Lynne; Keys, Heather R.; Wang, Tim; Sabatini, David M.] Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Chantranupong, Lynne; Keys, Heather R.; Wang, Tim; Sabatini, David M.] MIT, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Chantranupong, Lynne; Keys, Heather R.; Wang, Tim; Sabatini, David M.] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Chantranupong, Lynne; Keys, Heather R.; Sabatini, David M.] Broad Inst Harvard & MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11083,Article,,nathanael_gray@dfci.harvard.edu; sabatini@wi.mit.edu,U142,"National Institutes of Health [CA103866, CA129105]; Department of Defense [W81XWH-07-0448]; W.M.

152,377,17.0,"Overcoming metabolic stress is a critical step for solid tumour growth(1,2). However, the underlying mechanisms of cell death and survival under metabolic stress are not well understood. A key signalling pathway involved in metabolic adaptation is the liver kinase B1 (LKB1)-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway(2,3). Energy stress conditions that decrease intracellular ATP levels below a certain level promote AMPK activation by LKB1. Previous studies showed that LKB1-deficient or AMPK-deficient cells are resistant to oncogenic transformation and tumorigenesis(4-6), possibly because of the function of AMPK in metabolic adaptation. However, the mechanisms by which AMPK promotes metabolic adaptation in tumour cells are not fully understood. Here we show that AMPK activation, during energy stress, prolongs cell survival by redox regulation. Under these conditions, NADPH generation by the pentose phosphate pathway is impaired, but AMPK induces alternative routes to maintain NADPH and inhibit cell death. The inhibition of the acetyl-CoA carboxylases ACC1 and ACC2 by AMPK maintains NADPH levels by decreasing NADPH consumption in fatty-acid synthesis and increasing NADPH generation by means of fatty-acid oxidation. Knockdown of either ACC1 or ACC2 compensates for AMPK activation and facilitates anchorage-independent growth and solid tumour formation in vivo, whereas the activation of ACC1 or ACC2 attenuates these processes. Thus AMPK, in addition to its function in ATP homeostasis, has a key function in NADPH maintenance, which is critical for cancer cell survival under energy stress conditions, such as glucose limitations, anchorage-independent growth and solid tumour formation in vivo.","Jeon, Sang-Min; Chandel, Navdeep S.; Hay, Nissim","Jeon, SM; Chandel, NS; Hay, N",661.0,"[Jeon, Sang-Min; Hay, Nissim] Univ Illinois, Coll Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Genet, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; [Chandel, Navdeep S.] Northwestern Univ, Sch Med, Div Pulm & Crit Care Med, Dept Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11066,Article,1476-4687,nhay@uic.edu,+,"National Institutes of Health [CA090764, AG016927, AG025953]; Chicago Biomedical Consortium; Chicago Community;  [P60DK20595]","We thank B.
