0,38,294.0,"The extinct placoderm fishes were the dominant group of vertebrates throughout the Middle Palaeozoic era(1), yet controversy about their relationships within the gnathostomes ( jawed vertebrates) is partly due to different interpretations of their reproductive biology(2-5). Here we document the oldest record of a live- bearing vertebrate in a new ptyctodontid placoderm, Materpiscis attenboroughi gen. et sp. nov., from the Late Devonian Gogo Formation of Australia ( approximately 380 million years ago)(6). The new specimen, remarkably preserved in three dimensions, contains a single, intra- uterine embryo connected by a permineralized umbilical cord. An amorphous crystalline mass near the umbilical cord possibly represents the recrystallized yolk sac. Another ptyctodont from the Gogo Formation, Austroptyctodus gardineri(7), also shows three small embryos inside it in the same position. Ptyctodontids have already provided the oldest definite evidence for vertebrate copulation(8), and the new specimens confirm that some placoderms had a remarkably advanced reproductive biology, comparable to that of some modern sharks and rays. The new discovery points to internal fertilization and viviparity in vertebrates as originating earliest within placoderms.","Long, John A.; Trinajstic, Kate; Young, Gavin C.; Senden, Tim","Long, JA; Trinajstic, K; Young, GC; Senden, T",650.0,"[Long, John A.] Museum Victoria, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia; [Long, John A.; Young, Gavin C.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Long, John A.] Monash Univ, Sch Geosci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Trinajstic, Kate] Univ Western Australia, Sch Earth & Geog Sci, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Senden, Tim] Australian Natl Univ, Dept Appl Math, Res Sch Phys Sci & Engn, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06966,Article,,jlong@museum.vic.gov.au,U6,,,305NN,,,X-RAY TOMOGRAPHY; VIVIPARITY; FISH,7195.0,NATURE,Nature,English,17.0,No,"Senden, Tim/0000-0001-6808-7219; Long, John/0000-0001-8012-0114; Trinajstic, Kate/0000-0002-6519-6396","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",29-May,4.0,LONDON,18509443.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,"Trinajstic, Kate/B-2537-2009; Senden, Tim/A-7319-2008","Long, JA (reprint author), Museum Victoria, POB 666, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,56.0,Live birth in the Devonian period,4.0,33.0,WOS:000256185200043,294.0,453,Multidisciplinary Sciences,59,tim,senden,110.0,2949,male,0.99,S0tR7LoAAAAJ,1,"[0, 1474]",1506194,1,1506194,1,Steropodontidae,Steropodontidae,0,0
1,59,228.0,"During eukaryotic translation initiation, 43S complexes, comprising a 40S ribosomal subunit, initiator transfer RNA and initiation factors (eIF) 2, 3, 1 and 1A, attach to the 59-terminal region of messenger RNA and scan along it to the initiation codon. Scanning on structured mRNAs also requires the DExH-box protein DHX29. Mammalian eIF3 contains 13 subunits and participates in nearly all steps of translation initiation. Eight subunits having PCI (proteasome, COP9 signalosome, eIF3) or MPN (Mpr1, Pad1, amino-terminal) domains constitute the structural core of eIF3, to which five peripheral subunits are flexibly linked. Here we present a cryo-electron microscopy structure of eIF3 in the context of the DHX29-bound 43S complex, showing the PCI/MPN core at,6 angstrom resolution. It reveals the organization of the individual subunits and their interactions with components of the 43S complex. We were able to build near-complete polyalanine-level models of the eIF3 PCI/MPN core and of two peripheral subunits. The implications for understanding mRNA ribosomal attachment and scanning are discussed.","des Georges, Amedee; Dhote, Vidya; Kuhn, Lauriane; Hellen, Christopher U.

2,46,202.0,"Somatic alterations in cellular DNA underlie almost all human cancers(1). The prospect of targeted therapies(2) and the development of high-resolution, genome-wide approaches(3-8) are now spurring systematic efforts to characterize cancer genomes. Here we report a large-scale project to characterize copy-number alterations in primary lung adenocarcinomas. By analysis of a large collection of tumours ( n = 371) using dense single nucleotide polymorphism arrays, we identify a total of 57 significantly recurrent events. We find that 26 of 39 autosomal chromosome arms show consistent large-scale copy-number gain or loss, of which only a handful have been linked to a specific gene. We also identify 31 recurrent focal events, including 24 amplifications and 7 homozygous deletions. Only six of these focal events are currently associated with known mutations in lung carcinomas. The most common event, amplification of chromosome 14q13.3, is found in similar to 12% of samples. On the basis of genomic and functional analyses, we identify NKX2-1 ( NK2 homeobox 1, also called TITF1), which lies in the minimal 14q13.3 amplification interval and encodes a lineage-specific transcription factor, as a novel candidate proto-oncogene involved in a significant fraction of lung adenocarcinomas. More generally, our results indicate that many of the genes that are involved in lung adenocarcinoma remain to be discovered.","Weir, Barbara A.; Woo, Michele S.; Getz, Gad; Perner, Sven; Ding, Li; Beroukhim, Rameen; Lin, William M.; Province, Michael A.; Kraja, Aldi; Johnson, Laura A.; Shah, Kinjal; Sato, Mitsuo; Thomas, Roman K.; Barletta, Justine A.; Borecki, Ingrid B.; Broderick, Stephen; Chang, Andrew C.; Chiang, Derek Y.; Chirieac, Lucian R.; Cho, Jeonghee; Fujii, Yoshitaka; Gazdar, Adi F.; Giordano, Thomas; Greulich, Heidi; Hanna, Megan; Johnson, Bruce E.; Kris, Mark G.; Lash, Alex; Lin, Ling; Lindeman, Neal; Mardis, Elaine R.; McPherson, John D.; Minna, John D.; Morgan, Margaret B.; Nadel, Mark; Orringer, Mark B.; Osborne, John R.; Ozenberger, Brad; Ramos, Alex H.; Robinson, James; Roth, Jack A.; Rusch, Valerie; Sasaki, Hidefumi; Shepherd, Frances; Sougnez, Carrie; Spitz, Margaret R.; Tsao, Ming-Sound; Twomey, David; Verhaak, Roel G.

3,83,335.0,"PINK1 (PTEN induced putative kinase 1) and PARKIN (also known as PARK2) have been identified as the causal genes responsible for hereditary recessive early-onset Parkinsonism(1,2). PINK1 is a Ser/Thr kinase that specifically accumulates on depolarized mitochondria, whereas parkin is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that catalyses ubiquitin transfer to mitochondrial substrates(3-5). PINK1 acts as an upstream factor for parkin(6,7) and is essential both for the activation of latent E3 parkin activity(8) and for recruiting parkin onto depolarized mitochondria(8-12). Recently, mechanistic insights into mitochondrial quality control mediated by PINK1 and parkin have been revealed(3-5), and PINK1-dependent phosphorylation of parkin has been reported(13-15). However, the requirement of PINK1 for parkin activation was not bypassed by phosphomimetic parkin mutation(15), and how PINK1 accelerates the E3 activity of parkin on damaged mitochondria is still obscure. Here we report that ubiquitin is the genuine substrate of PINK1. PINK1 phosphorylated ubiquitin at Ser 65 both in vitro and in cells, and a Ser 65 phosphopeptide derived from endogenous ubiquitin was only detected in cells in the presence of PINK1 and following a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential. Unexpectedly, phosphomimetic ubiquitin bypassed PINK1-dependent activation of a phosphomimetic parkin mutant in cells. Furthermore, phosphomimetic ubiquitin accelerates discharge of the thioester conjugate formed by UBCH7 (also known as UBE2L3) and ubiquitin (UBCH7 ubiquitin) in the presence of parkin in vitro, indicating that it acts allosterically. The phosphorylation-dependent interaction between ubiquitin and parkin suggests that phosphorylated ubiquitin unlocks autoinhibition of the catalytic cysteine. Our results show that PINK1-dependent phosphorylation of both parkin and ubiquitin is sufficient for full activation of parkin E3 activity. These findings demonstrate that phosphorylated ubiquitin is a parkin activator.","Koyano, Fumika; Okatsu, Kei; Kosako, Hidetaka; Tamura, Yasushi; Go, Etsu; Kimura, Mayumi; Kimura, Yoko; Tsuchiya, Hikaru; Yoshihara, Hidehito; Hirokawa, Takatsugu; Endo, Toshiya; Fon, Edward A.; Trempe, Jean-Francois; Saeki, Yasushi; Tanaka, Keiji; Matsuda, Noriyuki","Koyano, F; Okatsu, K; Kosako, H; Tamura, Y; Go, E; Kimura, M; Kimura, Y; Tsuchiya, H; Yoshihara, H; Hirokawa, T; Endo, T; Fon, EA; Trempe, JF; Saeki, Y; Tanaka, K; Matsuda, N",162.0,"[Koyano, Fumika; Okatsu, Kei; Go, Etsu; Kimura, Mayumi; Kimura, Yoko; Tsuchiya, Hikaru; Yoshihara, Hidehito; Saeki, Yasushi; Tanaka, Keiji; Matsuda, Noriyuki] Tokyo Metropolitan Inst Med Sci, Lab Prot Metab, Setagaya Ku, Tokyo 1568506, Japan; [Koyano, Fumika; Okatsu, Kei] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778561, Japan; [Kosako, Hidetaka] Univ Tokushima, Div Cell Signaling, Fujii Mem Inst Med Sci, Tokushima 7708503, Japan; [Tamura, Yasushi] Nagoya Univ, Res Ctr Mat Sci, Nagoya, Aichi 4648602, Japan; [Kimura, Yoko] Shizuoka Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Shizuoka 4228529, Japan; [Hirokawa, Takatsugu] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Mol Profiling Res Ctr Drug Discovery, Koto Ku, Tokyo 1350064, Japan; [Endo, Toshiya] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Sci, JST CREST Dept Chem, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648602, Japan; [Endo, Toshiya] Kyoto Sangyo Univ, JST CREST Fac Life Sci, Kita Ku, Kyoto 6038555, Japan; [Fon, Edward A.] McGill Univ, McGill Parkinson Program, Dept Neurol & Neurosurg, Montreal Neurol Inst & Hosp, Montreal, PQ H3A 2B4, Canada; [Trempe, Jean-Francois] McGill Univ, Dept Pharmacol & Therapeut, Montreal, PQ H3G 1Y6, Canada; [Matsuda, Noriyuki] Tokyo Metropolitan Inst Med Sci, Prot Metab Project, Setagaya Ku, Tokyo 1568506, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13392,Article,1476-4687,tanaka-kj@igakuken.or.jp; matsuda-nr@igakuken.or.jp,+,"JSPS KAKENHI [23687018, 23-6061, 21000012, 24657072, 22227003]; MEXT KAKENHI [24111557, 25112522, 24112008]; Tomizawa Jun-ichi and Keiko Fund; JST CREST; Platform for Drug Discovery, Informatics, and Structural Life Science from MEXT; McGill University; GRASP from the FRSQ; CIHR; FRSQ; Takeda Science Foundation","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI grant numbers 23687018 (to N.M.), 23-6061 (to K.O.), 21000012 (to K.

4,65,347.0,"Only three elements are ferromagnetic at room temperature: the transition metals iron, cobalt and nickel. The Stoner criterion explains why iron is ferromagnetic but manganese, for example, is not, even though both elements have an unfilled 3d shell and are adjacent in the periodic table: according to this criterion, the product of the density of states and the exchange integral must be greater than unity for spontaneous spin ordering to emerge(1,2). Here we demonstrate that it is possible to alter the electronic states of non-ferromagnetic materials, such as diamagnetic copper and paramagnetic manganese, to overcome the Stoner criterion and make them ferromagnetic at room temperature. This effect is achieved via interfaces between metallic thin films and C-60 molecular layers. The emergent ferromagnetic state exists over several layers of the metal before being quenched at large sample thicknesses by the material's bulk properties. Although the induced magnetization is easily measurable by magnetometry, low-energy muon spin spectroscopy(3) provides insight into its distribution by studying the depolarization process of low-energy muons implanted in the sample. This technique indicates localized spin-ordered states at, and close to, the metal-molecule interface. Density functional theory simulations suggest a mechanism based on magnetic hardening of the metal atoms, owing to electron transfer(4,5). This mechanism might allow for the exploitation of molecular coupling to design magnetic metamaterials using abundant, non-toxic components such as organic semiconductors.

5,66,350.0,"Soils of the northern high latitudes store carbon over millennial timescales (thousands of years) and contain approximately double the carbon stock of the atmosphere(1-3). Warming and associated permafrost thaw can expose soil organic carbon and result in mineralization and carbon dioxide (CO2) release(4-6). However, some of this soil organic carbon may be eroded and transferred to rivers(7-9). If it escapes degradation during river transport and is buried in marine sediments, then it can contribute to a longer-term (more than ten thousand years), geological CO2 sink(8-10). Despite this recognition, the erosional flux and fate of particulate organic carbon (POC) in large rivers at high latitudes remains poorly constrained. Here, we quantify the source of POC in the Mackenzie River, the main sediment supplier to the Arctic Ocean(11,12), and assess its flux and fate. We combine measurements of radiocarbon, stable carbon isotopes and element ratios to correct for rock-derived POC10,13,14. Our samples reveal that the eroded biospheric POC has resided in the basin for millennia, with a mean radiocarbon age of 5,800 +/- 800 years, much older than the POC in large tropical rivers(13,14). From the measured biospheric POC content and variability in annual sediment yield(15), we calculate a biospheric POC flux of 2.2(-0.9)(+1.3) teragrams of carbon per year from the Mackenzie River, which is three times the CO2 drawdown by silicate weathering in this basin(16). Offshore, we find evidence for efficient terrestrial organic carbon burial over the Holocene period, suggesting that erosion of organic carbon-rich, high-latitude soils may result in an important geological CO2 sink.","Hilton, Robert G.; Galy, Valier; Gaillardet, Jerome; Dellinger, Mathieu; Bryant, Charlotte; O'Regan, Matt; Groecke, Darren R.; Coxall, Helen; Bouchez, Julien; Calmels, Damien","Hilton, RG; Galy, V; Gaillardet, J; Dellinger, M; Bryant, C; O'Regan, M; Grocke, DR; Coxall, H; Bouchez, J; Calmels, D",84.0,"[Hilton, Robert G.] Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Durham DH1 3LE, England; [Galy, Valier] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Marine Chem & Geochem, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Gaillardet, Jerome; Dellinger, Mathieu; Bouchez, Julien] Univ Paris Diderot, Inst Phys Globe Paris, Sorbonne Paris Cite, UMR CNRS 7154, F-75005 Paris, France; [Bryant, Charlotte] NERC Radiocarbon Facil, E Kilbride G75 OQF, Lanark, Scotland; [O'Regan, Matt; Coxall, Helen] Stockholm Univ, Dept Geol Sci, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Groecke, Darren R.] Univ Durham, Dept Earth Sci, Durham DH1 3LE, England; [Calmels, Damien] Univ Paris 11, Lab GEOPS, UMR CNRS 8148, F-91405 Orsay, France",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14653,Article,1476-4687,r.g.hilton@durham.ac.uk,U162,"Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), UK [1611.0312]; CNRS (OXYMORE); CNRS (CANNIBALT); Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Arctic Research Initiative; Early Career Research Grant by the British Society for Geomorphology; US National Science Foundation [OCE-0928582]; Royal Society University Fellowship","Radiocarbon measurements were funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), UK (Allocation 1611.0312) to R.G.H and C.B.

It is the basis for a variety of circuits and devices, with applications ranging from medicine(2) to quantum information(3). Experiments using Josephson circuits that behave like artificial atoms(4) are now revolutionizing the way we probe and exploit the laws of quantum physics(5,6). Microscopically, the supercurrent is carried by Andreev pair states, which are localized at the weak link. These states come in doublets and have energies inside the superconducting gap(7-10). Existing Josephson circuits are based on properties of just the ground state of each doublet, and so far the excited states have not been directly detected. Here we establish their existence through spectroscopic measurements of superconducting atomic contacts. The spectra, which depend on the atomic configuration and on the phase difference between the superconductors, are in complete agreement with theory. Andreev doublets could be exploited to encode information in novel types of superconducting qubits(11-13).","Bretheau, L.; Girit, C.

7,63,324.0,"mu-Opioid receptors (mu ORs) are G-protein-coupled receptors that are activated by a structurally diverse spectrum of natural and synthetic agonists including endogenous endorphin peptides, morphine and methadone. The recent structures of the mu OR in inactive(1) and agonist-induced active states (Huang et al., ref. 2) provide snapshots of the receptor at the beginning and end of a signalling event, but little is known about the dynamic sequence of events that span these two states. Here we use solution-state NMR to examine the process of mu OR activation using a purified receptor (mouse sequence) preparation in an amphiphile membrane-like environment. We obtain spectra of the mu OR in the absence of ligand, and in the presence of the high-affinity agonist BU72 alone, or with BU72 and a G protein mimetic nanobody. Our results show that conformational changes in transmembrane segments 5 and 6 (TM5 and TM6), which are required for the full engagement of a G protein, are almost completely dependent on the presence of both the agonist and the G protein mimetic nanobody, revealing a weak allosteric coupling between the agonist-binding pocket and the G-protein-coupling interface (TM5 and TM6), similar to that observed for the beta 2-adrenergic receptor(3). Unexpectedly, in the presence of agonist alone, we find larger spectral changes involving intracellular loop 1 and helix 8 compared to changes in TM5 and TM6. These results suggest that one or both of these domains may play a role in the initial interaction with the G protein, and that TM5 and TM6 are only engaged later in the process of complex formation. The initial interactions between the G protein and intracellular loop 1 and/or helix 8 may be involved in G-protein coupling specificity, as has been suggested for other family A G-protein-coupled receptors.","Sounier, Remy; Mas, Camille; Steyaert, Jan; Laeremans, Toon; Manglik, Aashish; Huang, Weijiao; Kobilka, Brian K.; Demene, Helene; Granier, Sebastien","Sounier, R; Mas, C; Steyaert, J; Laeremans, T; Manglik, A; Huang, WJ; Kobilka, BK; Demene, H; Granier, S",375.0,"[Sounier, Remy; Mas, Camille; Granier, Sebastien] Univ Montpellier, Inst Genom Fonct, CNRS, INSERM,U1191,UMR 5203, F-34000 Montpellier, France; [Steyaert, Jan; Laeremans, Toon] Vrije Univ Brussel, Struct Biol Brussels, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Steyaert, Jan; Laeremans, Toon] VIB, Struct Biol Res Ctr, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Manglik, Aashish; Huang, Weijiao; Kobilka, Brian K.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Physiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Demene, Helene] Univ Montpellier, Ctr Biochim Struct, CNRS, INSERM 1054,UMR 5048, F-34090 Montpellier, France",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14680,Article,1476-4687,helene@cbs.cnrs.fr; sebastien.granier@igf.cnrs.fr,+,INSERM; CNRS; National Institutes of Health [NIDA-DA036246],We acknowledge support from INSERM (S.G.) and CNRS (H.D.) and from the National Institutes of Health Grant (NIDA-DA036246 to B.K.K. and S.G.).

8,73,82.0,"Mesenchymal stem cells occupy niches in stromal tissues where they provide sources of cells for specialized mesenchymal derivatives during growth and repair(1). The origins of mesenchymal stem cells have been the subject of considerable discussion, and current consensus holds that perivascular cells form mesenchymal stem cells in most tissues. The continuously growing mouse incisor tooth offers an excellent model to address the origin of mesenchymal stem cells. These stem cells dwell in a niche at the tooth apex where they produce a variety of differentiated derivatives. Cells constituting the tooth are mostly derived from two embryonic sources: neural crest ectomesenchyme and ectodermal epithelium(2). It has been thought for decades that the dental mesenchymal stem cells(3) giving rise to pulp cells and odontoblasts derive from neural crest cells after their migration in the early head and formation of ectomesenchymal tissue(4,5). Here we show that a significant population of mesenchymal stem cells during development, self-renewal and repair of a tooth are derived from peripheral nerve-associated glia. Glial cells generate multipotent mesenchymal stem cells that produce pulp cells and odontoblasts. By combining a clonal colour-coding technique(6) with tracing of peripheral glia, we provide new insights into the dynamics of tooth organogenesis and growth.","Kaukua, Nina; Shahidi, Maryam Khatibi; Konstantinidou, Chrysoula; Dyachuk, Vyacheslav; Kaucka, Marketa; Furlan, Alessandro; An, Zhengwen; Wang, Longlong; Hultman, Isabell; Ahrlund-Richter, Larsa; Blom, Hans; Brismar, Hjalmar; Lopes, Natalia Assaife; Pachnis, Vassilis; Suter, Ueli; Clevers, Hans; Thesleff, Irma; Sharpe, Paul; Ernfors, Patrik; Fried, Kaj; Adameyko, Igor","Kaukua, N; Shahidi, MK; Konstantinidou, C; Dyachuk, V; Kaucka, M; Furlan, A; An, ZW; Wang, LL; Hultman, I; Ahrlund-Richter, L; Blom, H; Brismar, H; Lopes, NA; Pachnis, V; Suter, U; Clevers, H; Thesleff, I; Sharpe, P; Ernfors, P; Fried, K; Adameyko, I",551.0,"[Kaukua, Nina; Fried, Kaj] Karolinska Inst, Dept Neurosci, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Konstantinidou, Chrysoula; Pachnis, Vassilis] Natl Inst Med Res, MRC, Div Mol Neurobiol, London NW7 1AA, England; [Dyachuk, Vyacheslav; Kaucka, Marketa; Adameyko, Igor] Karolinska Inst, Dept Physiol & Pharmacol, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Dyachuk, Vyacheslav] Russian Acad Sci, Far Eastern Branch, AV Zhirmunsky Inst Marine Biol, Vladivostok 690041, Russia; [Furlan, Alessandro; Lopes, Natalia Assaife; Ernfors, Patrik] Karolinska Inst, Dept Med Biochem & Biophys, Mol Neurobiol Unit, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [An, Zhengwen; Wang, Longlong; Sharpe, Paul] Guys Hosp, Inst Dent, Kings Coll London, Dept Craniofacial Dev & Stem Cell Biol, London SE1 3QD, England; [Hultman, Isabell; Ahrlund-Richter, Larsa] Karolinska Inst, Dept Womens & Childrens Hlth, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Blom, Hans; Brismar, Hjalmar] Royal Inst Technol, Sci Life Lab, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Suter, Ueli] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Mol Hlth Sci, Dept Biol, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Clevers, Hans] Koninklijke Nederlandse Akad Wetenschappen KNAW, Hubrecht Inst, NL-3508 AD Utrecht, Netherlands; [Clevers, Hans] Univ Med Ctr Utrecht, Dept Mol Genet, NL-3508 GA Utrecht, Netherlands; [Clevers, Hans] Univ Helsinki, Dev Biol Program, Inst Biotechnol, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13536,Article,1476-4687,Kaj.Fried@ki.se; Igor.Adameyko@ki.se,+,Swedish Research Council; Bertil Hallsten Research Foundation; StratRegen; Wallenberg Foundation; Swiss National Science Foundation; Medical Research Council [G0901599]; Wallenberg Scholar and European Research Council; National Graduate School in Odontological Science; Swedish Dental Association; EMBO Long-Term Fellowship; Stockholm County Council; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank,"P.

9,22,199.0,"The largest extant snakes live in the tropics of South America and southeast Asia(1-3) where high temperatures facilitate the evolution of large body sizes among air- breathing animals whose body temperatures are dependant on ambient environmental temperatures ( poikilothermy)(4,5). Very little is known about ancient tropical terrestrial ecosystems, limiting our understanding of the evolution of giant snakes and their relationship to climate in the past. Here we describe a boid snake from the oldest known neotropical rainforest fauna from the Cerrejon Formation ( 58 - 60 Myr ago) in northeastern Colombia. We estimate a body length of 13 and a mass of 1,135 kg, making it the largest known snake(6-9). The maximum size of poikilothermic animals at a given temperature is limited by metabolic rate(4), and a snake of this size would require a minimum mean annual temperature of 30 - 34 degrees C to survive. This estimate is consistent with hypotheses of hot Palaeocene neotropics with high concentrations of atmospheric CO(2) based on climate models(10). Comparison of palaeotemperature estimates from the equator to those from South American mid- latitudes indicates a relatively steep temperature gradient during the early Palaeogene greenhouse, similar to that of today. Depositional environments and faunal composition of the Cerrejon Formation indicate an anaconda- like ecology for the giant snake, and an earliest Cenozoic origin of neotropical vertebrate faunas.","Head, Jason J.; Bloch, Jonathan I.; Hastings, Alexander K.; Bourque, Jason R.; Cadena, Edwin A.; Herrera, Fabiany A.; Polly, P.

Here we sequenced tumour and matched normal DNA from 13 DLBCL cases and one FL case to identify genes with mutations in B-cell NHL. We analysed RNA-seq data from these and another 113 NHLs to identify genes with candidate mutations, and then re-sequenced tumour and matched normal DNA from these cases to confirm 109 genes with multiple somatic mutations. Genes with roles in histone modification were frequent targets of somatic mutation. For example, 32% of DLBCL and 89% of FL cases had somatic mutations in MLL2, which encodes a histone methyltransferase, and 11.4% and 13.4% of DLBCL and FL cases, respectively, had mutations in MEF2B, a calcium-regulated gene that cooperates with CREBBP and EP300 in acetylating histones. Our analysis suggests a previously unappreciated disruption of chromatin biology in lymphomagenesis.","Morin, Ryan D.; Mendez-Lago, Maria; Mungall, Andrew J.; Goya, Rodrigo; Mungall, Karen L.; Corbett, Richard D.; Johnson, Nathalie A.; Severson, Tesa M.; Chiu, Readman; Field, Matthew; Jackman, Shaun; Krzywinski, Martin; Scott, David W.; Trinh, Diane L.; Tamura-Wells, Jessica; Li, Sa; Firme, Marlo R.; Rogic, Sanja; Griffith, Malachi; Chan, Susanna; Yakovenko, Oleksandr; Meyer, Irmtraud M.; Zhao, Eric Y.; Smailus, Duane; Moksa, Michelle; Chittaranjan, Suganthi; Rimsza, Lisa; Brooks-Wilson, Angela; Spinelli, John J.; Ben-Neriah, Susana; Meissner, Barbara; Woolcock, Bruce; Boyle, Merrill; McDonald, Helen; Tam, Angela; Zhao, Yongjun; Delaney, Allen; Zeng, Thomas; Tse, Kane; Butterfield, Yaron; Birol, Inanc; Holt, Rob; Schein, Jacqueline; Horsman, Douglas E.; Moore, Richard; Jones, Steven J.

11,81,273.0,"Tuberculosis remains second only to HIV/AIDS as the leading cause of mortality worldwide due to a single infectious agent(1). Despite chemotherapy, the global tuberculosis epidemic has intensified because of HIV co-infection, the lack of an effective vaccine and the emergence of multi-drug-resistant bacteria(2-5). Alternative host-directed strategies could be exploited to improve treatment efficacy and outcome, contain drug-resistant strains and reduce disease severity and mortality(6). The innate inflammatory response elicited by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) represents a logical host target(7). Here we demonstrate that interleukin-1 (IL-1) confers host resistance through the induction of eicosanoids that limit excessive type I interferon (IFN) production and foster bacterial containment. We further show that, in infected mice and patients, reduced IL-1 responses and/or excessive type I IFN induction are linked to an eicosanoid imbalance associated with disease exacerbation. Host-directed immunotherapy with clinically approved drugs that augment prostaglandin E2 levels in these settings prevented acute mortality of Mtb-infected mice. Thus, IL-1 and type I IFNs represent two major counter-regulatory classes of inflammatory cytokines that control the outcome of Mtb infection and are functionally linked via eicosanoids. Our findings establish proof of concept for host-directed treatment strategies that manipulate the host eicosanoid network and represent feasible alternatives to conventional chemotherapy.","Mayer-Barber, Katrin D.; Andrade, Bruno B.; Oland, Sandra D.; Amaral, Eduardo P.; Barber, Daniel L.; Gonzales, Jacqueline; Derrick, Steven C.; Shi, Ruiru; Kumar, Nathella Pavan; Wei, Wang; Yuan, Xing; Zhang, Guolong; Cai, Ying; Babu, Subash; Catalfamo, Marta; Salazar, Andres M.; Via, Laura E.; Barry, Clifton E., III; Sher, Alan","Mayer-Barber, KD; Andrade, BB; Oland, SD; Amaral, EP; Barber, DL; Gonzales, J; Derrick, SC; Shi, RR; Kumar, NP; Wei, W; Yuan, X; Zhang, GL; Cai, Y; Babu, S; Catalfamo, M; Salazar, AM; Via, LE; Barry, CE; Sher, A",99.0,"[Mayer-Barber, Katrin D.; Andrade, Bruno B.; Oland, Sandra D.; Amaral, Eduardo P.; Sher, Alan] NIAID, Immunobiol Sect, LPD, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Amaral, Eduardo P.] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Biomed Sci, Dept Immunol, BR-05508900 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Barber, Daniel L.] NIAID, Lymphocyte Biol Unit T, LPD, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Gonzales, Jacqueline; Via, Laura E.; Barry, Clifton E., III] NIAID, TB Res Sect, Lab Clin Infect Dis, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Derrick, Steven C.] US FDA, Ctr Biol Evaluat & Res, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Shi, Ruiru; Wei, Wang; Yuan, Xing] Henan Chest Hosp, Zhengzhou 450003, Peoples R China; [Kumar, Nathella Pavan; Babu, Subash] Int Ctr Excellence Res, NIH, Madras 600031, Tamil Nadu, India; [Kumar, Nathella Pavan] NIRT, Madras 600031, Tamil Nadu, India; [Zhang, Guolong] SinoUS Int Res Ctr TB, Zhengzhou 450003, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Guolong] Henan Publ Hlth Ctr, Zhengzhou 450003, Peoples R China; [Babu, Subash] NIAID, Helminth Immunol Sect, LPD, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Catalfamo, Marta] NIAID, Clin & Mol Retrovirol Sect, Immunoregulat Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Salazar, Andres M.] Oncovir Inc, Washington, DC 20008 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13489,Article,1476-4687,mayerk@niaid.nih.gov,U491,"NIAID Intramural Research program; Concept Acceleration Program-Award from DMID, NIAID","This work was supported by the NIAID Intramural Research program and a Concept Acceleration Program-Award (K.D.M.-B., B.B.A. and A.S.) from DMID, NIAID.

12,49,22.0,"The contribution of co-translational chaperone functions to protein folding is poorly understood. Ribosome-associated trigger factor (TF) is the first molecular chaperone encountered by nascent polypeptides in bacteria. Here we show, using fluorescence spectroscopy to monitor TF function and structural rearrangements in real time, that TF interacts with ribosomes and translating polypeptides in a dynamic reaction cycle. Ribosome binding stabilizes TF in an open, activated conformation. Activated TF departs from the ribosome after a mean residence time of similar to 10 s, but may remain associated with the elongating nascent chain for up to 35 s, allowing entry of a new TF molecule at the ribosome docking site. The duration of nascent-chain interaction correlates with the occurrence of hydrophobic motifs in translating polypeptides, reflecting a high aggregation propensity. These findings can explain how TF prevents misfolding events during translation and may provide a paradigm for the regulation of nucleotide-independent chaperones.","Kaiser, Christian M.; Chang, Hung-Chun; Agashe, Vishwas R.; Lakshmipathy, Sathish K.; Etchells, Stephanie A.; Hayer-Hartl, Manajit; Hartl, F.

13,50,39.0,"The most efficient energy sources known in the Universe are accretion disks. Those around black holes convert 5 - 40 per cent of restmass energy to radiation. Like water circling a drain, inflowing mass must lose angular momentum, presumably by vigorous turbulence in disks, which are essentially inviscid(1). The origin of the turbulence is unclear. Hot disks of electrically conducting plasma can become turbulent by way of the linear magnetorotational instability(2). Cool disks, such as the planet- forming disks of protostars, may be too poorly ionized for the magnetorotational instability to occur, and therefore essentially unmagnetized and linearly stable. Nonlinear hydrodynamic instability often occurs in linearly stable flows ( for example, pipe flows) at sufficiently large Reynolds numbers. Although planet- forming disks have extreme Reynolds numbers, keplerian rotation enhances their linear hydrodynamic stability, so the question of whether they can be turbulent and thereby transport angular momentum effectively is controversial(3-15). Here we report a laboratory experiment, demonstrating that non- magnetic quasi- keplerian flows at Reynolds numbers up to millions are essentially steady. Scaled to accretion disks, rates of angular momentum transport lie far below astrophysical requirements. By ruling out purely hydrodynamic turbulence, our results indirectly support the magnetorotational instability as the likely cause of turbulence, even in cool disks.","Ji, Hantao; Burin, Michael; Schartman, Ethan; Goodman, Jeremy","Ji, HT; Burin, M; Schartman, E; Goodman, J",343.0,"Princeton Univ, Ctr Magnet Self Org Lab & Astrophys Plasmas, Plasma Phys Lab, Princeton, NJ 08543 USA; Princeton Univ, Dept Astrophys Sci, Princeton, NJ 08543 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature05323,Article,,hji@pppl.gov,346,,,105GL,,,ROTATING CYLINDERS; ACCRETION DISKS; NONLINEAR STABILITY; SHEAR TURBULENCE; STRATIFIED DISKS; REYNOLDS-NUMBER; INSTABILITY; FLOW; CIRCULATION; EVOLUTION,7117.0,NATURE,Nature,English,32.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",16-Nov,4.0,LONDON,17108959.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,,"Ji, HT (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Ctr Magnet Self Org Lab & Astrophys Plasmas, Plasma Phys Lab, Princeton, NJ 08543 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,139.0,Hydrodynamic turbulence cannot transport angular momentum effectively in astrophysical disks,0.0,16.0,WOS:000242018300042,39.0,444,Multidisciplinary Sciences,139,jeremy,goodman,98.0,1840,male,0.99,OUIu4uoAAAAJ,1,"[0, 1474]",42790519,1,17914517,1,Chloe Goodman,Chloe Goodman,1,1

Zonal flow formation in nuclear fusion devices is also well studied(2). A common feature of these zonal flows is that they are spontaneously generated in turbulent systems. Because the Earth's outer core is believed to be in a turbulent state, it is possible that there is zonal flow in the liquid iron of the outer core. Here we report an investigation at the current low-viscosity limit of numerical simulations of the geodynamo. We find a previously unknown convection regime of the outer core that has a dual structure comprising inner, sheet-like radial plumes and an outer, westward cylindrical zonal flow. We numerically confirm that the dual-convection structure with such a zonal flow is stable under a strong, self-generated dipole magnetic field.","Miyagoshi, Takehiro; Kageyama, Akira; Sato, Tetsuya","Miyagoshi, T; Kageyama, A; Sato, T",793.0,"[Kageyama, Akira] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan; [Miyagoshi, Takehiro] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan; [Sato, Tetsuya] Univ Hyogo, Kobe, Hyogo 6500044, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08754,Article,,kage@cs.kobe-u.ac.jp,U102,KAKENHI [17540404]; Mitsubishi Foundation,This work was supported by KAKENHI (17540404) and The Mitsubishi Foundation.,553VG,,,ROTATING SPHERICAL-SHELL; GEODYNAMO SIMULATIONS; DEEP CONVECTION; RAYLEIGH NUMBER; DRIVEN; EQUATIONS; PLANETS; DYNAMOS; FIELD; MODEL,7282.0,NATURE,Nature,English,26.0,No,"Kageyama, Akira/0000-0003-0433-668X","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",11-Feb,5.0,LONDON,20148036.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2010.0,"Kageyama, Akira/H-4537-2013","Kageyama, A (reprint author), Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,36.0,Zonal flow formation in the Earth's core,0.0,19.0,WOS:000274394300036,389.0,463,Multidisciplinary Sciences,36,tetsuya,sato,456.0,16,male,1.0,bpM4ZKkAAAAJ,1,"[0, 1474]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
15,98,229.0,"The detection of electron spins associated with single defects in solids is a critical operation for a range of quantum information and measurement applications under development(1-9). So far, it has been accomplished for only two defect centres in crystalline solids: phosphorus dopants in silicon, for which electrical read-out based on a single-electron transistor is used(1), and nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond, for which optical read-out is used(4-6). A spin readout fidelity of about 90 per cent has been demonstrated with both electrical read-out(1) and optical read-out(10,11); however, the thermal limitations of the former and the poor photon collection efficiency of the latter make it difficult to achieve the higher fidelities required for quantum information applications. Here we demonstrate a hybrid approach in which optical excitation is used to change the charge state (conditional on its spin state) of an erbium defect centre in a silicon-based single-electron transistor, and this change is then detected electrically. The high spectral resolution of the optical frequency-addressing step overcomes the thermal broadening limitation of the previous electrical read-out scheme, and the charge-sensing step avoids the difficulties of efficient photon collection. This approach could lead to new architectures for quantum information processing devices and could drastically increase the range of defect centres that can be exploited. Furthermore, the efficient electrical detection of the optical excitation of single sites in silicon represents a significant step towards developing interconnects between optical-based quantum computing and silicon technologies.","Yin, Chunming; Rancic, Milos; de Boo, Gabriele G.; Stavrias, Nikolas; McCallum, Jeffrey C.; Sellars, Matthew J.; Rogge, Sven","Yin, CM; Rancic, M; de Boo, GG; Stavrias, N; McCallum, JC; Sellars, MJ; Rogge, S",91.0,"[Yin, Chunming; de Boo, Gabriele G.; Rogge, Sven] Univ New S Wales, Sch Phys, Ctr Excellence Quantum Computat & Commun Technol, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Rancic, Milos; Sellars, Matthew J.] Australian Natl Univ, RSPE, Ctr Excellence Quantum Computat & Commun Technol, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Stavrias, Nikolas; McCallum, Jeffrey C.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Phys, Ctr Excellence Quantum Computat & Commun Technol, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12081,Article,1476-4687,s.rogge@unsw.edu.au,94,"ARC Centre of Excellence for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology [CE110001027]; Future Fellowships [FT100100589, FT110100919]","We thank R.

16,135,434.0,"M1 protein, a major virulence factor of the leading invasive strain of group A Streptococcus, is sufficient to induce toxic-shock-like vascular leakage and tissue injury. These events are triggered by the formation of a complex between M1 and fibrinogen that, unlike M1 or fibrinogen alone, leads to neutrophil activation. Here we provide a structural explanation for the pathological properties of the complex formed between streptococcal M1 and human fibrinogen. A conformationally dynamic coiled-coil dimer of M1 was found to organize four fibrinogen molecules into a specific cross-like pattern. This pattern supported the construction of a supramolecular network that was required for neutrophil activation but was distinct from a fibrin clot. Disruption of this network into other supramolecular assemblies was not tolerated. These results have bearing on the pathophysiology of streptococcal toxic shock.","Macheboeuf, Pauline; Buffalo, Cosmo; Fu, Chi-yu; Zinkernagel, Annelies S.; Cole, Jason N.; Johnson, John E.; Nizet, Victor; Ghosh, Partho","Macheboeuf, P; Buffalo, C; Fu, CY; Zinkernagel, AS; Cole, JN; Johnson, JE; Nizet, V; Ghosh, P",64.0,"[Macheboeuf, Pauline; Buffalo, Cosmo; Ghosh, Partho] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Chem & Biochem, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Fu, Chi-yu; Johnson, John E.] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Zinkernagel, Annelies S.; Cole, Jason N.; Nizet, Victor] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Pediat, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Cole, Jason N.] Univ Queensland, Sch Chem & Mol Biosci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Nizet, Victor] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Pharm & Pharmaceut Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09967,Article,1476-4687,pghosh@ucsd.edu,68,"NIH [R21 AI071167, T32 GM007240, R01 AI077780, R01 GM54076]; National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia [514639]","We thank the Argonne Photon Source Laboratory GM/CA CAT staff for help with data collection, R.

We determined the genomic distribution of binding sites for 92 transcription factors and regulatory proteins across multiple stages of Caenorhabditis elegans development by performing 241 ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing) experiments. Integration of regulatory binding and cellular-resolution expression data produced a spatio-temporally resolved metazoan transcription factor binding map. Using this map, we explore developmental regulatory circuits that encode combinatorial logic at the levels of co-binding and co-expression of transcription factors, characterizing the genomic coverage and clustering of regulatory binding, the binding preferences of, and biological processes regulated by, transcription factors, the global transcription factor co-associations and genomic subdomains that suggest shared patterns of regulation, and identifying key transcription factors and transcription factor co-associations for fate specification of individual lineages and cell types.","Araya, Carlos L.; Kawli, Trupti; Kundaje, Anshul; Jiang, Lixia; Wu, Beijing; Vafeados, Dionne; Terrell, Robert; Weissdepp, Peter; Gevirtzman, Louis; Mace, Daniel; Niu, Wei; Boyle, Alan P.; Xie, Dan; Ma, Lijia; Murray, John I.; Reinke, Valerie; Waterston, Robert H.; Snyder, Michael","Araya, CL; Kawli, T; Kundaje, A; Jiang, LX; Wu, BJ; Vafeados, D; Terrell, R; Weissdepp, P; Gevirtzman, L; Mace, D; Niu, W; Boyle, AP; Xie, D; Ma, LJ; Murray, JI; Reinke, V; Waterston, RH; Snyder, M",400.0,"[Araya, Carlos L.; Kawli, Trupti; Jiang, Lixia; Wu, Beijing; Boyle, Alan P.; Xie, Dan; Snyder, Michael] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kundaje, Anshul] MIT, Dept Comp Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Vafeados, Dionne; Terrell, Robert; Weissdepp, Peter; Gevirtzman, Louis; Mace, Daniel; Waterston, Robert H.] Univ Washington, Dept Genome Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Niu, Wei; Reinke, Valerie] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Ma, Lijia] Univ Chicago, Inst Genom & Syst Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Murray, John I.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Dept Genet, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13497,Article,1476-4687,watersto@u.washington.edu; mpsnyder@stanford.edu,U363,NHGRI as part of the modENCODE project [U01 HG004267],"We thank G.

18,91,284.0,"The effect of anthropogenic aerosols on cloud droplet concentrations and radiative properties is the source of one of the largest uncertainties in the radiative forcing of climate over the industrial period. This uncertainty affects our ability to estimate how sensitive the climate is to greenhouse gas emissions. Here we perform a sensitivity analysis on a global model to quantify the uncertainty in cloud radiative forcing over the industrial period caused by uncertainties in aerosol emissions and processes. Our results show that 45 per cent of the variance of aerosol forcing since about 1750 arises from uncertainties in natural emissions of volcanic sulphur dioxide, marine dimethylsulphide, biogenic volatile organic carbon, biomass burning and sea spray. Only 34 per cent of the variance is associated with anthropogenic emissions. The results point to the importance of understanding pristine pre-industrial-like environments, with natural aerosols only, and suggest that improved measurements and evaluation of simulated aerosols in polluted present-day conditions will not necessarily result in commensurate reductions in the uncertainty of forcing estimates.","Carslaw, K.

19,131,212.0,"The location and timing of cellular differentiation must be stringently controlled for proper organ formation. Normally, hepatocytes differentiate from hepatic progenitor cells to form the liver during development(1,2). However, previous studies have shown that the hepatic program can also be activated in non-hepatic lineage cells after exposure to particular stimuli or fusion with hepatocytes(3-9). These unexpected findings suggest that factors critical to hepatocyte differentiation exist and become activated to induce hepatocyte-specific properties in different cell types. Here, by screening the effects of twelve candidate factors, we identify three specific combinations of two transcription factors, comprising Hnf4 alpha plus Foxa1, Foxa2 or Foxa3, that can convert mouse embryonic and adult fibroblasts into cells that closely resemble hepatocytes in vitro. The induced hepatocyte-like (iHep) cells have multiple hepatocyte-specific features and reconstitute damaged hepatic tissues after transplantation. The generation of iHep cells may provide insights into the molecular nature of hepatocyte differentiation and potential therapies for liver diseases.","Sekiya, Sayaka; Suzuki, Atsushi","Sekiya, S; Suzuki, A",390.0,"[Sekiya, Sayaka; Suzuki, Atsushi] Kyushu Univ, Div Organogenesis & Regenerat, Med Inst Bioregulat, Higashi Ku, Fukuoka 8128582, Japan; [Suzuki, Atsushi] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, Precursory Res Embryon Sci & Technol PRESTO, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10263,Article,,suzukicks@bioreg.kyushu-u.ac.jp,U148,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan; Japan Science and Technology Agency","We thank A.

20,29,380.0,"A basic requirement for quantum information processing systems is the ability to completely control the state of a single qubit(1-6). For qubits based on electron spin, a universal single- qubit gate is realized by a rotation of the spin by any angle about an arbitrary axis. Driven, coherent Rabi oscillations between two spin states can be used to demonstrate control of the rotation angle. Ramsey interference, produced by two coherent spin rotations separated by a variable time delay, demonstrates control over the axis of rotation. Full quantum control of an electron spin in a quantum dot has previously been demonstrated using resonant radio- frequency pulses that require many spin precession periods(7-10). However, optical manipulation of the spin allows quantum control on a picosecond or femtosecond timescale(11-18), permitting an arbitrary rotation to be completed within one spin precession period(6). Recent work in optical single-spin control has demonstrated the initialization of a spin state in a quantumdot(19-22), as well as the ultrafast manipulation of coherence in a largely unpolarized single- spin state(17). Here we demonstrate complete coherent control over an initialized electron spin state in a quantum dot using picosecond optical pulses. First we vary the intensity of a single optical pulse to observe over six Rabi oscillations between the two spin states; then we apply two sequential pulses to observe high- contrast Ramsey interference. Such a two- pulse sequence realizes an arbitrary single- qubit gate completed on a picosecond timescale. Along with the spin initialization and final projective measurement of the spin state, these results demonstrate a complete set of all- optical single- qubit operations.","Press, David; Ladd, Thaddeus D.; Zhang, Bingyang; Yamamoto, Yoshihisa","Press, D; Ladd, TD; Zhang, BY; Yamamoto, Y",218.0,"[Press, David; Ladd, Thaddeus D.; Zhang, Bingyang; Yamamoto, Yoshihisa] Stanford Univ, Edward L Ginzton Lab, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Ladd, Thaddeus D.; Yamamoto, Yoshihisa] Res Org Informat & Syst, Natl Inst Informat, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1018403, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07530,Article,,dlpress@stanford.edu,221,"JST/SORST; NICT; MEXT; MURI [(ARMY, DAAD 19-03-1-0199)]; Special Coordination Funds for Promoting Science and Technology","This work was supported by JST/SORST, NICT, MEXT, MURI (ARMY, DAAD 19-03-1-0199) and Special Coordination Funds for Promoting Science and Technology.

21,101,366.0,"More than half of mammalian genes generate multiple messenger RNA isoforms that differ in their 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) and therefore in regulatory sequences(1), often associated with cell proliferation and cancer(2,3); however, the mechanisms coordinating alternative 3'-UTR processing for specific mRNA populations remain poorly defined. Here we report that the cytoplasmic-polyadenylation element binding protein 1 (CPEB1), an RNA-binding protein that regulates mRNA translation(4), also controls alternative 3'-UTR processing. CPEB1 shuttles to the nudeus(5,6), where it co-localizes with splicing factors and mediates shortening of hundreds of mRNA 3' UTRs, thereby modulating their translation efficiency in the cytoplasm. CPEB1-mediated 3'-UTR shortening correlates with cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. CPEB1 binding to pre-mRNAs not only directs the use of alternative polyadenylation sites, but also changes alternative splicing by preventing U2AF65 recruitment. Our results reveal a novel function of CPEB1 in mediating alternative 3'-UTR processing, which is coordinated with regulation of mRNA translation, through its dual nuclear and cytoplasmic functions.","Bava, Felice-Alessio; Eliscovich, Carolina; Ferreira, Pedro G.; Minana, Belen; Ben-Dov, Claudia; Guigo, Roderic; Valcarcel, Juan; Mendez, Raul","Bava, FA; Eliscovich, C; Ferreira, PG; Minana, B; Ben-Dov, C; Guigo, R; Valcarcel, J; Mendez, R",121.0,"[Bava, Felice-Alessio; Mendez, Raul] Inst Res Biomed IRB Barcelona, Barcelona 08028, Spain; [Eliscovich, Carolina; Ferreira, Pedro G.; Minana, Belen; Ben-Dov, Claudia; Guigo, Roderic; Valcarcel, Juan] UPF, Ctr Genom Regulat CRG, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Valcarcel, Juan; Mendez, Raul] Passeig Lluis Co 23, ICREA, Barcelona 08010, Spain",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11901,Article,,raul.mendez@irbbarcelona.org,125,"Consolider; MICINN; Generalitat de Catalunya; RNAREG; AICR; EURASNET; Fundacion Marcelino Botin; National Institutes of Health; Instituto de Salud Carlos III; ""la Caixa"" predoctoral fellowship; FCT-Portugal; Spanish MICINN; ICREA","We thank A.

22,74,94.0,"Stresses acting on cold, thick and negatively buoyant oceanic lithosphere are thought to be crucial to the initiation of subduction and the operation of plate tectonics(1,2), which characterizes the present-day geodynamics of the Earth. Because the Earth's interior was hotter in the Archaean eon, the oceanic crust may have been thicker, thereby making the oceanic lithosphere more buoyant than at present(3), and whether subduction and plate tectonics occurred during this time is ambiguous, both in the geological record and in geodynamic models(4). Here we show that because the oceanic crust was thick and buoyant(5), early continents may have produced intra-lithospheric gravitational stresses large enough to drive their gravitational spreading, to initiate subduction at their margins and to trigger episodes of subduction. Our model predicts the co-occurrence of deep to progressively shallower mafic volcanics and arc magmatism within continents in a self-consistent geodynamic framework, explaining the enigmatic multimodal volcanism and tectonic record of Archaean cratons(6). Moreover, our model predicts a petrological stratification and tectonic structure of the sub-continental lithospheric mantle, two predictions that are consistent with xenolith(5) and seismic studies, respectively, and consistent with the existence of amid-lithospheric seismic discontinuity(7). The slow gravitational collapse of early continents could have kick-started transient episodes of plate tectonics until, as the Earth's interior cooled and oceanic lithosphere became heavier, plate tectonics became self-sustaining.","Rey, Patrice F.; Coltice, Nicolas; Flament, Nicolas","Rey, PF; Coltice, N; Flament, N",405.0,"[Rey, Patrice F.; Flament, Nicolas] Univ Sydney, Earthbyte Res Grp, Sch Geosci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Coltice, Nicolas] Univ Lyon 1, Ecole Normale Super Lyon, UMR CNRS 5276, Lab Geol Lyon, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France; [Coltice, Nicolas] Inst Univ France, F-75005 Paris, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13728,Article,1476-4687,patrice.rey@sydney.edu.au,+,Australian Government; Institut Universitaire de France; European Research Council (ERC) [617588]; Statoil ASA,"We thank W.

23,121,153.0,"Understanding the dynamics of correlated many-body quantum systems is a challenge for modern physics. Owing to the simplicity of theirHamiltonians, He-4 (bosons) and He-3 (fermions) have served as model systems for strongly interacting quantum fluids, with substantial efforts devoted to their understanding. An important milestone was the direct observation of the collective phonon-roton mode in liquid He-4 by neutron scattering, verifying Landau's prediction(1) and his fruitful concept of elementary excitations. In a Fermi system, collective density fluctuations (known as 'zero-sound' in He-3, and 'plasmons' in charged systems) and incoherent particle-hole excitations are observed. At small wavevectors and energies, both types of excitation are described by Landau's theory of Fermi liquids(2,3). At higher wavevectors, the collectivemode enters the particle-hole band, where it is strongly damped. The dynamics of Fermi liquids at high wavevectors was thus believed to be essentially incoherent. Here we report inelastic neutron scattering measurements of a monolayer of liquid He-3, observing a roton-like excitation. We find that the collective density mode reappears as a well defined excitation atmomentum transfers larger than twice the Fermi momentum. We thus observe unexpected collective behaviour of a Fermi many-body system in the regime beyond the scope of Landau's theory. A satisfactory interpretation of the measured spectra is obtained using a dynamic many-body theory(4).","Godfrin, Henri; Meschke, Matthias; Lauter, Hans-Jochen; Sultan, Ahmad; Boehm, Helga M.; Krotscheck, Eckhard; Panholzer, Martin","Godfrin, H; Meschke, M; Lauter, HJ; Sultan, A; Bohm, HM; Krotscheck, E; Panholzer, M",576.0,"[Godfrin, Henri; Meschke, Matthias; Sultan, Ahmad] CNRS, Inst Neel, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France; [Godfrin, Henri; Meschke, Matthias; Sultan, Ahmad] Univ Grenoble 1, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France; [Meschke, Matthias] Aalto Univ, Low Temp Lab, Aalto 00076, Finland; [Lauter, Hans-Jochen] Inst Laue Langevin, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France; [Lauter, Hans-Jochen] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Boehm, Helga M.; Krotscheck, Eckhard; Panholzer, Martin] Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Inst Theoret Phys, A-4040 Linz, Austria; [Krotscheck, Eckhard] SUNY Buffalo, Dept Phys, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10919,Article,,henri.godfrin@grenoble.cnrs.fr,579,Austrian Fonds zur Forderung der wissenschaftlichen Forschung (FWF) [P21264]; French Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-2010-INTB-403-01]; EU [228464],"We are grateful to the Austrian-French programme Amadeus for providing initial support; to the Austrian Fonds zur Forderung der wissenschaftlichen Forschung (FWF grant P21264), the French Agence Nationale de la Recherche (project ANR-2010-INTB-403-01) and the EU FRP7 low-temperature infrastructure grant Microkelvin (project number 228464) for funding this research; and to the Institut Laue-Langevin for use of the facility.",915EF,,,ELEMENTARY EXCITATIONS; EFFECTIVE-MASS; NEUTRON-SCATTERING; SPIN FLUCTUATIONS; ZERO SOUND; HE-3; FILMS; PLASMONS; GRAPHITE; DYNAMICS,7391.0,NATURE,Nature,English,31.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",29-Mar,4.0,LONDON,22460903.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2012.0,"Meschke, Matthias/G-5166-2012","Godfrin, H (reprint author), CNRS, Inst Neel, BP 166, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,17.0,Observation of a roton collective mode in a two-dimensional Fermi liquid,5.0,40.0,WOS:000302006100034,153.0,483,Multidisciplinary Sciences,17,martin,panholzer,118.0,3568,male,1.0,oDRnEUgAAAAJ,1,"[0, 1474]",143848,1,143848,1,List of suicides,List of suicides,0,0
24,25,261.0,"Many organisms can enter a dormant state or diapause to survive harsh environmental conditions for extended durations. When Caenorhabditis elegans larvae enter dauer they arrest feeding but remain active and motile, yet become stress- resistant, extremely long- lived and non- ageing(1). Entry into dauer is associated with a reduction in insulin- like signalling, the accumulation of nutritive resources and a concomitant global change in metabolism(2-5), yet the precise molecular and physiological processes that enable long- term survival in the absence of caloric intake remain largely unknown. We show here that C. elegans larvae that lack LKB1/ AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) signalling enter dauer normally, but then rapidly consume their stored energy and prematurely expire following vital organ failure. We found that this signalling pathway acts in adipose- like tissues to downregulate triglyceride hydrolysis so that these lipid reserves are rationed to last the entire duration of the arrest. Indeed, the downregulation of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL-1) activity suppresses both the rapid depletion of stored lipids and reduced life span of AMPK mutant dauers, while AMPK directly phosphorylates ATGL-1. Finally, we show that the slow release of energy during dauer is critical for appropriate long- term osmoregulation, which fails as triglyceride resources become depleted. These mechanisms may be essential for survival through diapause, hibernation, or long- term fasting in diverse organisms and may also underlie AMPK- dependent life span extension.","Narbonne, Patrick; Roy, Richard","Narbonne, P; Roy, R",210.0,"[Narbonne, Patrick; Roy, Richard] McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07536,Article,,richard.roy@mcgill.ca,U108,Canadian Cancer Society; Canadian Institutes of Health Research,"We thank A.

25,109,258.0,"Epigenetic information is frequently erased near the start of each new generation(1). In some cases, however, epigenetic information can be transmitted from parent to progeny (multigenerational epigenetic inheritance)(2). A particularly notable example of this type of epigenetic inheritance is double-stranded RNA-mediated gene silencing in Caenorhabditis elegans. This RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) can be inherited for more than five generations(3-8). To understand this process, here we conduct a genetic screen for nematodes defective in transmitting RNAi silencing signals to future generations. This screen identified the heritable RNAi defective 1 (hrde-1) gene. hrde-1 encodes an Argonaute protein that associates with small interfering RNAs in the germ cells of progeny of animals exposed to double-stranded RNA. In the nuclei of these germ cells, HRDE-1 engages the nuclear RNAi defective pathway to direct the trimethylation of histone H3 at Lys 9 (H3K9me3) at RNAi-targeted genomic loci and promote RNAi inheritance. Under normal growth conditions, HRDE-1 associates with endogenously expressed short interfering RNAs, which direct nuclear gene silencing in germ cells. In hrde-1- or nuclear RNAi-deficient animals, germline silencing is lost over generational time. Concurrently, these animals exhibit steadily worsening defects in gamete formation and function that ultimately lead to sterility. These results establish that the Argonaute protein HRDE-1 directs gene-silencing events in germ-cell nuclei that drive multigenerational RNAi inheritance and promote immortality of the germ-cell lineage. We propose that C. elegans use the RNAi inheritance machinery to transmit epigenetic information, accrued by past generations, into future generations to regulate important biological processes.","Buckley, Bethany A.; Burkhart, Kirk B.; Gu, Sam Guoping; Spracklin, George; Kershner, Aaron; Fritz, Heidi; Kimble, Judith; Fire, Andrew; Kennedy, Scott","Buckley, BA; Burkhart, KB; Gu, SG; Spracklin, G; Kershner, A; Fritz, H; Kimble, J; Fire, A; Kennedy, S",447.0,"[Buckley, Bethany A.; Burkhart, Kirk B.; Spracklin, George; Fritz, Heidi; Kimble, Judith; Kennedy, Scott] Univ Wisconsin, Lab Genet, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Gu, Sam Guoping; Fire, Andrew] Stanford Univ, Dept Pathol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Gu, Sam Guoping; Fire, Andrew] Stanford Univ, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kershner, Aaron; Fritz, Heidi] Univ Wisconsin, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Kershner, Aaron; Kimble, Judith] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biochem, Madison, WI 53706 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11352,Article,,sgkennedy@wisc.edu,451,"Pew scholar's program; Shaw scholar's program; National Institutes of Health [GM88289, GM37706, GM069454]","We thank P.

Here we describe a comprehensive evaluation of the genomic landscape of 452 CLL cases and 54 patients with monoclonal B-lymphocytosis, a precursor disorder. We extend the number of CLL driver alterations, including changes in ZNF292, ZMYM3, ARID1A and PTPN11. We also identify novel recurrent mutations in non-coding regions, including the 39 region of NOTCH1, which cause aberrant splicing events, increase NOTCH1 activity and result in a more aggressive disease. In addition, mutations in an enhancer located on chromosome 9p13 result in reduced expression of the B-cell-specific transcription factor PAX5. The accumulative number of driver alterations (0 to >= 4) discriminated between patients with differences in clinical behaviour. This study provides an integrated portrait of the CLL genomic landscape, identifies new recurrent driver mutations of the disease, and suggests clinical interventions that may improve the management of this neoplasia.","Puente, Xose S.; Bea, Silvia; Valdes-Mas, Rafael; Villamor, Neus; Gutierrez-Abril, Jesus; Martin-Subero, Jose I.; Munar, Marta; Rubio-Perez, Carlota; Jares, Pedro; Aymerich, Marta; Baumann, Tycho; Beekman, Renee; Belver, Laura; Carrio, Anna; Castellano, Giancarlo; Clot, Guillem; Colado, Enrique; Colomer, Dolors; Costa, Dolors; Delgado, Julio; Enjuanes, Anna; Estivill, Xavier; Ferrando, Adolfo A.; Gelpi, Josep L.; Gonzalez, Blanca; Gonzalez, Santiago; Gonzalez, Marcos; Gut, Marta; Hernandez-Rivas, Jesus M.; Lopez-Guerra, Monica; Martin-Garcia, David; Navarro, Alba; Nicolas, Pilar; Orozco, Modesto; Payer, Angel R.; Pinyol, Magda; Pisano, David G.; Puente, Diana A.; Queiros, Ana C.; Quesada, Victor; Romeo-Casabona, Carlos M.; Royo, Cristina; Royo, Romina; Rozman, Maria; Russinol, Nuria; Salaverria, Itziar; Stamatopoulos, Kostas; Stunnenberg, Hendrik G.; Tamborero, David; Terol, Maria J.; Valencia, Alfonso; Lopez-Bigas, Nuria; Torrents, David; Gut, Ivo; Lopez-Guillermo, Armando; Lopez-Otin, Carlos; Campo, Elias","Puente, XS; Bea, S; Valdes-Mas, R; Villamor, N; Gutierrez-Abril, J; Martin-Subero, JI; Munar, M; Rubio-Perez, C; Jares, P; Aymerich, M; Baumann, T; Beekman, R; Belver, L; Carrio, A; Castellano, G; Clot, G; Colado, E; Colomer, D; Costa, D; Delgado, J; Enjuanes, A; Estivill, X; Ferrando, AA; Gelpi, JL; Gonzalez, B; Gonzalez, S; Gonzalez, M; Gut, M; Hernandez-Rivas, JM; Lopez-Guerra, M; Martin-Garcia, D; Navarro, A; Nicolas, P; Orozco, M; Payer, AR; Pinyol, M; Pisano, DG; Puente, DA; Queiros, AC; Quesada, V; Romeo-Casabona, CM; Royo, C; Royo, R; Rozman, M; Russinol, N; Salaverria, I; Stamatopoulos, K; Stunnenberg, HG; Tamborero, D; Terol, MJ; Valencia, A; Lopez-Bigas, N; Torrents, D; Gut, I; Lopez-Guillermo, A; Lopez-Otin, C; Campo, E",519.0,"[Puente, Xose S.; Valdes-Mas, Rafael; Gutierrez-Abril, Jesus; Puente, Diana A.; Quesada, Victor; Lopez-Otin, Carlos] Univ Oviedo, Inst Univ Oncol IUOPA, Dept Bioquim & Biol Mol, E-33006 Oviedo, Spain; [Bea, Silvia; Beekman, Renee; Castellano, Giancarlo; Clot, Guillem; Martin-Garcia, David; Navarro, Alba; Royo, Cristina; Russinol, Nuria; Salaverria, Itziar] IDIBAPS, Barcelona 08036, Spain; [Villamor, Neus; Aymerich, Marta; Carrio, Anna; Colomer, Dolors; Costa, Dolors; Gonzalez, Blanca; Lopez-Guerra, Monica; Rozman, Maria; Campo, Elias] Univ Barcelona, IDIBAPS, Hosp Clin, Unitat Hematol, E-08036 Barcelona, Spain; [Martin-Subero, Jose I.; Queiros, Ana C.] Univ Barcelona, Dept Anat Patol Microbiol & Farmacol, E-08036 Barcelona, Spain; [Munar, Marta; Gelpi, Josep L.; Gonzalez, Santiago; Orozco, Modesto; Royo, Romina; Torrents, David] Univ Barcelona, Spanish Natl Bioinformat Inst, Programa Conjunto Biol Computac, BSC,IRB, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; [Rubio-Perez, Carlota; Tamborero, David; Lopez-Bigas, Nuria] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Expt & Hlth Sci, Res Unit Biomed Informat, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Jares, Pedro; Enjuanes, Anna; Pinyol, Magda] IDIBAPS, Unidad Genom, Barcelona 08036, Spain; [Baumann, Tycho; Delgado, Julio; Lopez-Guillermo, Armando] IDIBAPS, Hosp Clin, Serv Hematol, Barcelona 08036, Spain; [Belver, Laura; Ferrando, Adolfo A.] Columbia Univ, Inst Canc Genet, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Colado, Enrique; Payer, Angel R.] Hosp Univ Cent Asturias, Serv Hematol, Oviedo 33011, Spain; [Estivill, Xavier] Pompeu Fabra Univ, Hosp Mar Res Inst IMIM, CRG, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Gonzalez, Marcos; Hernandez-Rivas, Jesus M.] Univ Salamanca, Hosp Univ Salamanca, Ctr Invest Canc, Serv Hematol,IBSAL,CSIC, Salamanca 37007, Spain; [Gut, Marta; Gut, Ivo] Ctr Nacl Anal Genom, Barcelona 08028, Spain; [Nicolas, Pilar; Romeo-Casabona, Carlos M.] Univ Basque Country, Univ Deusto, Catedra Interuniv Derecho & Genoma Humano, Bilbao 48007, Spain; [Pisano, David G.; Valencia, Alfonso] Spanish Natl Bioinformat Inst, Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, Struct Biol & Biocomp Programme, Madrid 28029, Spain; [Stamatopoulos, Kostas] Ctr Res & Technol Hellas, Inst Appl Biosci, Thessaloniki 57001, Greece; [Stunnenberg, Hendrik G.] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Nijmegen Ctr Mol Life Sci, Fac Sci, Dept Mol Biol, NL-6500 HB Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Terol, Maria J.] Hosp Clin Valencia, Serv Hematol, Valencia 46010, Spain",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14666,Article,1476-4687,clo@uniovi.es; ecampo@clinic.ub.es,U115,Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through the Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII); Red Tematica de Investigacion del Cancer (RTICC); Banco Santander through its Santander Universities Global Division,"This work was funded by Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through the Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII) and Red Tematica de Investigacion del Cancer (RTICC).

27,105,2.0,"The nucleus of the Milky Way is known to harbour regions of intense star formation activity as well as a supermassive black hole(1). Recent observations have revealed regions of gamma-ray emission reaching far above and below the Galactic Centre (relative to the Galactic plane), the so-called 'Fermi bubbles'(2). It is uncertain whether these were generated by nuclear star formation or by quasar-like outbursts of the central black hole(3-6) and no information on the structures' magnetic field has been reported. Here we report observations of two giant, linearly polarized radio lobes, containing three ridgelike substructures, emanating from the Galactic Centre. The lobes each extend about 60 degrees in the Galactic bulge, closely corresponding to the Fermi bubbles, and are permeated by strong magnetic fields of up to 15 microgauss. We conclude that the radio lobes originate in a biconical, star-formation-driven (rather than black-hole-driven) outflow from the Galaxy's central 200 parsecs that transports a huge amount of magnetic energy, about 10(55) ergs, into the Galactic halo. The ridges wind around this outflow and, we suggest, constitute a 'phonographic' record of nuclear star formation activity over at least ten million years.","Carretti, Ettore; Crocker, Roland M.; Staveley-Smith, Lister; Haverkorn, Marijke; Purcell, Cormac; Gaensler, B.

28,11,212.0,"Variation in transcriptional regulation is thought to be a major cause of phenotypic diversity(1,2). Although widespread differences in gene expression among individuals of a species have been observed(3-8), studies to examine the variability of transcription factor binding on a global scale have not been performed, and thus the extent and underlying genetic basis of transcription factor binding diversity is unknown. By mapping differences in transcription factor binding among individuals, here we present the genetic basis of such variation on a genome-wide scale. Whole-genome Ste12-binding profiles were determined using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with DNA sequencing in pheromone-treated cells of 43 segregants of a cross between two highly diverged yeast strains and their parental lines. We identified extensive Ste12-binding variation among individuals, and mapped underlying cis- and trans-acting loci responsible for such variation. We showed that most transcription factor binding variation is cis- linked, and that many variations are associated with polymorphisms residing in the binding motifs of Ste12 as well as those of several proposed Ste12 cofactors. We also identified two transfactors, AMN1 and FLO8, that modulate Ste12 binding to promoters of more than ten genes under alpha-factor treatment. Neither of these two genes was previously known to regulate Ste12, and we suggest that they may be mediators of gene activity and phenotypic diversity. Ste12 binding strongly correlates with gene expression for more than 200 genes, indicating that binding variation is functional. Many of the variable-bound genes are involved in cell wall organization and biogenesis. Overall, these studies identified genetic regulators of molecular diversity among individuals and provide new insights into mechanisms of gene regulation.","Zheng, Wei; Zhao, Hongyu; Mancera, Eugenio; Steinmetz, Lars M.; Snyder, Michael","Zheng, W; Zhao, HY; Mancera, E; Steinmetz, LM; Snyder, M",1187.0,"[Zheng, Wei; Snyder, Michael] Yale Univ, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Zhao, Hongyu] Yale Univ, Program Computat Biol & Bioinformat, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Zhao, Hongyu] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Mancera, Eugenio; Steinmetz, Lars M.] European Mol Biol Lab, Genome Biol Unit, Heidelberg, Germany; [Snyder, Michael] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08934,Article,,mpsnyder@stanford.edu,U106,National Institutes of Health (NIH) [RR19895],"We thank J.

29,54,62.0,"The formation of relativistic jets by an accreting compact object is one of the fundamental mysteries of astrophysics. Although the theory is poorly understood, observations of relativistic jets from systems known as microquasars (compact binary stars)(1,2) have led to a well established phenomenology(3,4). Relativistic jets are not expected to be produced by sources with soft or supersoft X-ray spectra, although two such systems are known to produce relatively low-velocity bipolar outflows(5,6). Here we report the optical spectra of an ultraluminous supersoft X-ray source (ULS7,8) in the nearby galaxy M81 (M81 ULS-1; refs 9, 10). Unexpectedly, the spectra show blueshifted, broad H alpha emission lines, characteristic of baryonic jets with relativistic speeds. These time-variable emission lines have projected velocities of about 17 per cent of the speed of light, and seem to be similar to those from the prototype microquasar SS 433 (refs 11, 12). Such relativistic jets are not expected to be launched from white dwarfs(13), and an origin from a black hole or a neutron star is hard to reconcile with the persistence of M81 ULS-1's soft X-rays(10). Thus the unexpected presence of relativistic jets in a ULS challenges canonical theories of jet formation(3,4), but might be explained by a long-speculated, supercritically accreting black hole with optically thick outflows(14-20).","Liu, Ji-Feng; Bai, Yu; Wang, Song; Justham, Stephen; Lu, You-Jun; Gu, Wei-Min; Liu, Qing-Zhong; Di Stefano, Rosanne; Guo, Jin-Cheng; Cabrera-Lavers, Antonio; Alvarez, Pedro; Cao, Yi; Kulkarni, Shri","Liu, JF; Bai, Y; Wang, S; Justham, S; Lu, YJ; Gu, WM; Liu, QZ; Di Stefano, R; Guo, JC; Cabrera-Lavers, A; Alvarez, P; Cao, Y; Kulkarni, S",108.0,"[Liu, Ji-Feng; Bai, Yu; Wang, Song; Justham, Stephen; Lu, You-Jun; Guo, Jin-Cheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Natl Astron Observ, Key Lab Opt Astron, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China; [Liu, Ji-Feng; Justham, Stephen; Lu, You-Jun] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Astron & Space Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Gu, Wei-Min] Xiamen Univ, Dept Astron, Xiamen 361005, Fujian Province, Peoples R China; [Liu, Qing-Zhong] Chinese Acad Sci, Purple Mt Observ, Key Lab Dark Matter & Space Astron, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Di Stefano, Rosanne] Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Cabrera-Lavers, Antonio; Alvarez, Pedro] Inst Astrofis Canarias, E-38200 San Cristobal la Laguna, Tenerife, Spain; [Cabrera-Lavers, Antonio; Alvarez, Pedro] Univ La Laguna, Dept Astrofis, E-38205 San Cristobal la Laguna, Tenerife, Spain; [Cao, Yi; Kulkarni, Shri] CALTECH, Dept Astron, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15751,Article,1476-4687,jfliu@nao.cas.cn,+,Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB09000000]; 973 Program [2014CB845705]; National Science Foundation of China [NSFC-11333004/11425313]; W.M.

30,94,87.0,"Gene expression differs among individuals and populations and is thought to be a major determinant of phenotypic variation. Although variation and genetic loci responsible for RNA expression levels have been analysed extensively in human populations(1-5), our knowledge is limited regarding the differences in human protein abundance and the genetic basis for this difference. Variation in messenger RNA expression is not a perfect surrogate for protein expression because the latter is influenced by an array of post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, and, empirically, the correlation between protein and mRNA levels is generally modest(6,7). Here we used isobaric tag-based quantitative mass spectrometry to determine relative protein levels of 5,953 genes in lymphoblastoid cell lines from 95 diverse individuals genotyped in the HapMap Project(8,9). We found that protein levels are heritable molecular phenotypes that exhibit considerable variation between individuals, populations and sexes. Levels of specific sets of proteins involved in the same biological process covary among individuals, indicating that these processes are tightly regulated at the protein level. We identified cis-pQTLs (protein quantitative trait loci), including variants not detected by previous transcriptome studies. This study demonstrates the feasibility of high-throughput human proteome quantification that, when integrated with DNA variation and transcriptome information, adds a new dimension to the characterization of gene expression regulation.","Wu, Linfeng; Candille, Sophie I.; Choi, Yoonha; Xie, Dan; Jiang, Lihua; Li-Pook-Than, Jennifer; Tang, Hua; Snyder, Michael","Wu, LF; Candille, SI; Choi, Y; Xie, D; Jiang, LH; Li-Pook-Than, J; Tang, H; Snyder, M",79.0,"[Wu, Linfeng; Candille, Sophie I.; Choi, Yoonha; Xie, Dan; Jiang, Lihua; Li-Pook-Than, Jennifer; Tang, Hua; Snyder, Michael] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12223,Article,,huatang@stanford.edu; mpsnyder@stanford.edu,82,NIH,We thank S.

31,145,334.0,"Ion-translocating rotary ATPases serve either as ATP synthases, using energy from a transmembrane ion motive force to create the cell's supply of ATP, or as transmembrane ion pumps that are powered by ATP hydrolysis(1). The members of this family of enzymes each contain two rotary motors: one that couples ion translocation to rotation and one that couples rotation to ATP synthesis or hydrolysis. During ATP synthesis, ion translocation through the membrane-bound region of the complex causes rotation of a central rotor that drives conformational changes and ATP synthesis in the catalytic region of the complex. There are no structural models available for the intact membrane region of any ion-translocating rotary ATPase. Here we present a 9.7 angstrom resolution map of the H+-driven ATP synthase from Thermus thermophilus obtained by electron cryomicroscopy of single particles in ice. The 600-kilodalton complex has an overall subunit composition of A(3)B(3)CDE(2)FG(2)IL(12). The membrane-bound motor consists of a ring of L subunits and the carboxy-terminal region of subunit I, which are equivalent to the c and a subunits of most other rotary ATPases, respectively. The map shows that the ring contains 12 L subunits(2) and that the I subunit has eight transmembrane helices(3). The L-12 ring and I subunit have a surprisingly small contact area in the middle of the membrane, with helices from the I subunit making contacts with two different L subunits. The transmembrane helices of subunit I form bundles that could serve as half-channels across the membrane, with the first half-channel conducting protons from the periplasm to the L-12 ring and the second half-channel conducting protons from the L-12 ring to the cytoplasm. This structure therefore suggests the mechanism by which a transmembrane proton motive force is converted to rotation in rotary ATPases.","Lau, Wilson C.

32,116,63.0,"Cell-surface receptors frequently use scaffold proteins to recruit cytoplasmic targets, but the rationale for this is uncertain. Activated receptor tyrosine kinases, for example, engage scaffolds such as Shc1 that contain phosphotyrosine (pTyr)-binding (PTB) domains. Using quantitative mass spectrometry, here we show that mammalian Shc1 responds to epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation through multiple waves of distinct phosphorylation events and protein interactions. After stimulation, Shc1 rapidly binds a group of proteins that activate pro-mitogenic or survival pathways dependent on recruitment of the Grb2 adaptor to Shc1 pTyr sites. Akt-mediated feedback phosphorylation of Shc1 Ser 29 then recruits the Ptpn12 tyrosine phosphatase. This is followed by a sub-network of proteins involved in cytoskeletal reorganization, trafficking and signal termination that binds Shc1 with delayed kinetics, largely through the SgK269 pseudokinase/adaptor protein. Ptpn12 acts as a switch to convert Shc1 from pTyr/Grb2-based signalling to SgK269-mediated pathways that regulate cell invasion and morphogenesis. The Shc1 scaffold therefore directs the temporal flow of signalling information after EGF stimulation.","Zheng, Yong; Zhang, Cunjie; Croucher, David R.; Soliman, Mohamed A.; St-Denis, Nicole; Pasculescu, Adrian; Taylor, Lorne; Tate, Stephen A.; Hardy, W.

33,88,158.0,"The seismic gap theory(1) identifies regions of elevated hazard based on a lack of recent seismicity in comparison with other portions of a fault. It has successfully explained past earthquakes (see, for example, ref. 2) and is useful for qualitatively describing where large earthquakes might occur. A large earthquake had been expected in the subduction zone adjacent to northern Chile(3-6), which had not ruptured in a megathrust earthquake since a M similar to 8.8 event in 1877. On 1 April 2014 a M8.2 earthquake occurred within this seismic gap. Here we present an assessment of the seismotectonics of the March-April 2014 Iquique sequence, including analyses of earthquake relocations, moment tensors, finite fault models, moment deficit calculations and cumulative Coulomb stress transfer. This ensemble of information allows us to place the sequence within the context of regional seismicity and to identify areas of remaining and/or elevated hazard. Our results constrain the size and spatial extent of rupture, and indicate that this was not the earthquake that had been anticipated. Significant sections of the northern Chile subduction zone have not ruptured in almost 150 years, so it is likely that future megathrust earthquakes will occur to the south and potentially to the north of the 2014 Iquique sequence.","Hayes, Gavin P.; Herman, Matthew W.; Barnhart, William D.; Furlong, Kevin P.; Riquelme, Sebastian; Benz, Harley M.; Bergman, Eric; Barrientos, Sergio; Earle, Paul S.; Samsonov, Sergey","Hayes, GP; Herman, MW; Barnhart, WD; Furlong, KP; Riquelme, S; Benz, HM; Bergman, E; Barrientos, S; Earle, PS; Samsonov, S",295.0,"[Hayes, Gavin P.; Barnhart, William D.; Benz, Harley M.; Earle, Paul S.] US Geol Survey, Natl Earthquake Informat Ctr, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [Herman, Matthew W.; Furlong, Kevin P.] Penn State Univ, Dept Geosci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Riquelme, Sebastian; Barrientos, Sergio] Univ Chile, Ctr Sismol Nacl, Santiago 8370449, Chile; [Bergman, Eric] Global Seismol Serv, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [Samsonov, Sergey] Nat Resources Canada, Canada Ctr Mapping & Earth Observat, Ottawa, ON K1A 0E4, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13677,Article,1476-4687,ghayes@usgs.gov,+,National Science Foundation [EAR-1153317],"We thank R.

34,57,283.0,"The inferior temporal cortex ( IT) of primates is thought to be the final visual area in the ventral stream of cortical areas responsible for object recognition(1,2). Consistent with this hypothesis, single IT neurons respond selectively to highly complex visual stimuli such as faces(3-6). However, a direct causal link between the activity of face- selective neurons and face perception has not been demonstrated. In the present study of macaque monkeys, we artificially activated small clusters of IT neurons by means of electrical microstimulation while the monkeys performed a categorization task, judging whether noisy visual images belonged to ' face ' or ' non- face' categories. Here we show that microstimulation of face-selective sites, but not other sites, strongly biased the monkeys' decisions towards the face category. The magnitude of the effect depended upon the degree of face selectivity of the stimulation site, the size of the stimulated cluster of face- selective neurons, and the exact timing of microstimulation. Our results establish a causal relationship between the activity of face- selective neurons and face perception.","Afraz, Seyed-Reza; Kiani, Roozbeh; Esteky, Hossein","Afraz, SR; Kiani, R; Esteky, H",692.0,"Inst Studies Theoret Phys & Math, Sch Cognit Sci, Tehran 19395, Iran; Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Res Ctr Brain & Cognit Sci, Tehran 19385, Iran; Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Neurosci Res Ctr, Tehran 19385, Iran",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature04982,Article,,esteky@ipm.ir,695,,,071UU,,,TEMPORAL VISUAL-CORTEX; PYRAMIDAL TRACT CELLS; INTRACORTICAL MICROSTIMULATION; ELECTRICAL MICROSTIMULATION; SINGLE NEURONS; AREA MT; MACAQUE; RESPONSES; DIRECTION; MONKEY,7103.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",10-Aug,4.0,LONDON,16878143.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,,"Esteky, H (reprint author), Inst Studies Theoret Phys & Math, Sch Cognit Sci, Tehran 19395, Iran.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,143.0,Microstimulation of inferotemporal cortex influences face categorization,0.0,9.0,WOS:000239630200047,283.0,442,Multidisciplinary Sciences,146,hossein,esteky,1691.0,41,male,0.98,vDnQD4sAAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
35,33,449.0,"To understand the processes that regulate the abundance and persistence of wild populations is a fundamental goal of ecology and a prerequisite for the management of living resources. Variable abundance data, however, make the demonstration of regulation processes challenging(1-3). A previously overlooked aspect in understanding how populations are regulated(4-6) is the possibility that the pattern of variability - its strength as a function of population size - may be more than 'noise', thus revealing much about the characteristics of population regulation. Here we show that patterns in survival variability do provide evidence of regulation through density. Using a large, global compilation of marine, anadromous and freshwater fisheries data, we examine the relationship between the variability of survival and population abundance. The interannual variability in progeny survival increases at low adult abundance in an inversely density- dependent fashion. This pattern is consistent with models in which density dependence enters after the larval stage. The findings are compatible with very simple forms of density dependence: even a linear increase of juvenile mortality with adult density adequately explains the results. The model predictions explain why populations with strong regulation may experience large increases in variability at low densities(7). Furthermore, the inverse relationship between survival variability and the strength of density dependence has important consequences for fisheries management and recovery, and population persistence or extinction(8-10).","Minto, Coilin; Myers, Ransom A.; Blanchard, Wade","Minto, C; Myers, RA; Blanchard, W",344.0,"[Minto, Coilin] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS B3H 4J1, Canada; [Blanchard, Wade] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Halifax, NS B3H 3J5, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06605,Article,,mintoc@mathstat.dal.ca,U6,,,276BX,,,MARINE DEMERSAL FISH; DEPENDENCE; RECRUITMENT; MORTALITY; TIME; COD; AGE,7185.0,NATURE,Nature,English,33.0,No,"Minto, Coilin/0000-0003-0630-6775","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",20-Mar,5.0,LONDON,18354480.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,,"Minto, C (reprint author), Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS B3H 4J1, Canada.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,51.0,Survival variability and population density in fish populations,2.0,66.0,WOS:000254117400045,449.0,452,Multidisciplinary Sciences,52,wade,blanchard,1987.0,157,male,1.0,SBPYOOMAAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",38633853,1,184420,1,Mary Hazelton Blanchard Wade,Mary Hazelton Blanchard Wade,1,1
36,79,9.0,"One of the most important classifications in chemistry and within the periodic table is the concept of formal oxidation states(1-4). The preparation and characterization of compounds containing elements with unusual oxidation states is of great interest to chemists(5). The highest experimentally known formal oxidation state of any chemical element is at present VIII2-4, although higher oxidation states have been postulated(6,7). Compounds with oxidation state VIII include several xenon compounds(8) (for example XeO4 and XeO3F2) and the well-characterized species RuO4 and OsO4 (refs 2-4). Iridium, which has nine valence electrons, is predicted to have the greatest chance of being oxidized beyond the VIII oxidation state(1). In recent matrix-isolation experiments, the IrO4 molecule was characterized as an isolated molecule in rare-gas matrices(9). The valence electron configuration of iridium in IrO4 is 5d(1), with a formal oxidation state of VIII. Removal of the remaining d electron from IrO4 would lead to the iridium tetroxide cation ([IrO4](+)), which was recently predicted to be stable(10) and in which iridium is in a formal oxidation state of IX. There has been some speculation about the formation of [IrO4](+) species(11,12), but these experimental observations have not been structurally confirmed. Here we report the formation of [IrO4](+) and its identification by infrared photodissociation spectroscopy. Quantum-chemical calculations were carried out at the highest level of theory that is available today, and predict that the iridium tetroxide cation, with a T-d-symmetrical structure and a d(0) electron configuration, is the most stable of all possible [IrO4](+) isomers.","Wang, Guanjun; Zhou, Mingfei; Goettel, James T.; Schrobilgen, Gary J.; Su, Jing; Li, Jun; Schloeder, Tobias; Riedel, Sebastian","Wang, GJ; Zhou, MF; Goettel, JT; Schrobilgen, GJ; Su, J; Li, J; Schloder, T; Riedel, S",475.0,"[Wang, Guanjun; Zhou, Mingfei] Fudan Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Chem Energy Mat, Shanghai Key Lab Mol Catalysts & Innovat Mat, Dept Chem, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Goettel, James T.; Schrobilgen, Gary J.] McMaster Univ, Dept Chem, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M1, Canada; [Su, Jing; Li, Jun] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Chem, Minist Educ, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Su, Jing; Li, Jun] Tsinghua Univ, Key Lab Organ Optoelect & Mol Engn, Minist Educ, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Schloeder, Tobias; Riedel, Sebastian] Univ Freiburg, Inst Anorgan & Analyt Chem, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Riedel, Sebastian] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Chem & Biochem Anorgan Chem, D-14195 Berlin, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13795,Article,1476-4687,mfzhou@fudan.edu.cn; schrobil@mcmaster.ca; sriedel@psichem.de,+,"Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2013CB834603, 2012YQ220113-3]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [21173053, 21433005, 91026003]; Committee of Science and Technology of Shanghai [13XD1400800]; Fonds der Chemischen Industrie; GRK [1582]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (2013CB834603 and 2012YQ220113-3), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant nos 21173053, 21433005 and 91026003), the Committee of Science and Technology of Shanghai (13XD1400800), the Fonds der Chemischen Industrie and the GRK 1582 'Fluorine as a key element'.

37,112,392.0,"The ABC toxin complexes produced by certain bacteria are of interest owing to their potent insecticidal activity(1,2) and potential role in human disease(3). These complexes comprise at least three proteins (A, B and C), which must assemble to be fully toxic(4). The carboxyterminal region of the C protein is the main cytotoxic component(5), and is poorly conserved between different toxin complexes. A general model of action has been proposed, in which the toxin complex binds to the cell surface via the A protein, is endocytosed, and subsequently forms a pH-triggered channel, allowing the translocation of C into the cytoplasm, where it can cause cytoskeletal disruption in both insect and mammalian cells(5). Toxin complexes have been visualized using single-particle electron microscopy(6,7), but no high-resolution structures of the components are available, and the role of the B protein in the mechanism of toxicity remains unknown. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of the complex formed between the B and C proteins, determined to 2.5 angstrom by X-ray crystallography. These proteins assemble to form an unprecedented, large hollow structure that encapsulates and sequesters the cytotoxic, C-terminal region of the C protein like the shell of an egg. The shell is decorated on one end by a beta-propeller domain, which mediates attachment of the B-C heterodimer to the A protein in the native complex. The structure reveals how C auto-proteolyses when folded in complex with B. The C protein is the first example, to our knowledge, of a structure that contains rearrangement hotspot (RHS) repeats(8), and illustrates a marked structural architecture that is probably conserved across both this widely distributed bacterial protein family and the related eukaryotic tyrosine-aspartate (YD)-repeat-containing protein family, which includes the teneurins(9). The structure provides the first clues about the function of these protein repeat families, and suggests a generic mechanism for protein encapsulation and delivery.","Busby, Jason N.; Panjikar, Santosh; Landsberg, Michael J.; Hurst, Mark R.

40,140,201.0,"In 1961, Rolf Landauer argued that the erasure of information is a dissipative process(1). A minimal quantity of heat, proportional to the thermal energy and called the Landauer bound, is necessarily produced when a classical bit of information is deleted. A direct consequence of this logically irreversible transformation is that the entropy of the environment increases by a finite amount. Despite its fundamental importance for information theory and computer science(2-5), the erasure principle has not been verified experimentally so far, the main obstacle being the difficulty of doing single-particle experiments in the low-dissipation regime. Here we experimentally show the existence of the Landauer bound in a generic model of a one-bit memory. Using a system of a single colloidal particle trapped in a modulated double-well potential, we establish that the mean dissipated heat saturates at the Landauer bound in the limit of long erasure cycles.

41,4,229.0,"Many physiological events require transient increases in cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations. Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are ion channels that govern the release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic and sarcoplasmic reticulum(1). Mutations in RyRs can lead to severe genetic conditions that affect both cardiac and skeletal muscle, but locating the mutated residues in the full-length channel structure has been difficult(2,3). Here we show the 2.5 angstrom resolution crystal structure of a region spanning three domains of RyR type 1 (RyR1), encompassing amino acid residues 1-559. The domains interact with each other through a predominantly hydrophilic interface. Docking in RyR1 electron microscopy maps(4,5) unambiguously places the domains in the cytoplasmic portion of the channel, forming a 240-kDa cytoplasmic vestibule around the four-fold symmetry axis. We pinpoint the exact locations of more than 50 disease-associated mutations in full-length RyR1 and RyR2. The mutations can be classified into three groups: those that destabilize the interfaces between the three amino-terminal domains, disturb the folding of individual domains or affect one of six interfaces with other parts of the receptor. We propose a model whereby the opening of a RyR coincides with allosterically coupled motions within the N-terminal domains. This process can be affected by mutations that target various interfaces within and across subunits. The crystal structure provides a framework to understand the many disease-associated mutations in RyRs that have been studied using functional methods, and will be useful for developing new strategies to modulate RyR function in disease states.","Tung, Ching-Chieh; Lobo, Paolo A.; Kimlicka, Lynn; Van Petegem, Filip","Tung, CC; Lobo, PA; Kimlicka, L; Van Petegem, F",585.0,"[Tung, Ching-Chieh; Lobo, Paolo A.; Kimlicka, Lynn; Van Petegem, Filip] Univ British Columbia, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09471,Article,,filip.vanpetegem@gmail.com,U267,Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada,"We thank the staff at beamline 08ID-1 of the Canadian Light source, the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource, K.

42,107,248.0,"DNA replication initiates at defined sites called origins, which serve as binding sites for initiator proteins that recruit the replicative machinery. Origins differ in number and structure across the three domains of life(1) and their properties determine the dynamics of chromosome replication. Bacteria and some archaea replicate from single origins, whereas most archaea and all eukaryotes replicate using multiple origins. Initiation mechanisms that rely on homologous recombination operate in some viruses. Here we show that such mechanisms also operate in archaea. We use deep sequencing to study replication in Haloferax volcanii and identify four chromosomal origins of differing activity. Deletion of individual origins results in perturbed replication dynamics and reduced growth. However, a strain lacking all origins has no apparent defects and grows significantly faster than wild type. Origin-less cells initiate replication at dispersed sites rather than at discrete origins and have an absolute requirement for the recombinase RadA, unlike strains lacking individual origins. Our results demonstrate that homologous recombination alone can efficiently initiate the replication of an entire cellular genome. This raises the question of what purpose replication origins serve and why they have evolved.","Hawkins, Michelle; Malla, Sunir; Blythe, Martin J.; Nieduszynski, Conrad A.; Allers, Thorsten","Hawkins, M; Malla, S; Blythe, MJ; Nieduszynski, CA; Allers, T",544.0,"[Hawkins, Michelle; Nieduszynski, Conrad A.; Allers, Thorsten] Univ Nottingham, Queens Med Ctr, Sch Biol, Nottingham NG7 2UH, England; [Malla, Sunir; Blythe, Martin J.] Univ Nottingham, Queens Med Ctr, Deep Seq, Nottingham NG7 2UH, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12650,Article,1476-4687,conrad.nieduszynski@nottingham.ac.uk; thorsten.allers@nottingham.ac.uk,+,"Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/E023754/1, BB/G001596/1]; Royal Society","This work was supported through the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) (BB/E023754/1, BB/G001596/1).

43,47,406.0,"Unlike Earth, where astronomical climate forcing is comparatively small, Mars experiences dramatic changes in incident sunlight that are capable of redistributing ice on a global scale(1-6). The geographic extent of the subsurface ice found poleward of approximately +/-60 degrees latitude on both hemispheres of Mars(7-9) coincides with the areas where ice is stable(7,10,11). However, the tilt of Mars' rotation axis (obliquity) changed considerably in the past several million years. Earlier work(3,12) has shown that regions of ice stability, which are defined by temperature and atmospheric humidity, differed in the recent past from today's, and subsurface ice is expected to retreat quickly when unstable(11-13). Here I explain how the subsurface ice sheets could have evolved to the state in which we see them today. Simulations of the retreat and growth of ground ice as a result of sublimation loss and recharge reveal forty major ice ages over the past five million years. Today, this gives rise to pore ice at mid-latitudes and a three-layered depth distribution in the high latitudes of, from top to bottom, a dry layer, pore ice, and a massive ice sheet. Combined, these layers provide enough ice to be compatible with existing neutron and gamma-ray measurements(7-9).","Schorghofer, Norbert","Schorghofer, N",192.0,"Univ Hawaii, Inst Astron, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; Univ Hawaii, NASA, Astrobiol Inst, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06082,Article,1476-4687,norbert@hawaii.edu,U2,,,209NF,,,GROUND ICE; ASTRONOMICAL THEORY; HIGH OBLIQUITY; NEAR-SURFACE; DEPOSITS; PRECIPITATION; INSOLATION; LATITUDES; STABILITY; HYDROGEN,7159.0,NATURE,Nature,English,25.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",13-Sep,4.0,LONDON,17851518.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007.0,,"Schorghofer, N (reprint author), Univ Hawaii, Inst Astron, 2680 Woodlawn Dr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,60.0,Dynamics of ice ages on Mars,0.0,10.0,WOS:000249394500043,406.0,449,Multidisciplinary Sciences,61,norbert,schorghofer,1576.0,77,male,1.0,pjJENOsAAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",13674307,1,30154014,1,Cold trap (astronomy),Cold trap (astronomy),0,0

The molecular processes of neurotransmitter binding, subsequent opening of the ion channel and ion permeation remain poorly understood. Here we present the X-ray structure of a mammalian Cys-loop receptor, the mouse serotonin 5-HT3 receptor, at 3.5 angstrom resolution. The structure of the proteolysed receptor, made up of two fragments and comprising part of the intracellular domain, was determined in complex with stabilizing nanobodies. The extracellular domain reveals the detailed anatomy of the neurotransmitter binding site capped by a nanobody. The membrane domain delimits an aqueous pore with a 4.6 angstrom constriction. In the intracellular domain, a bundle of five intracellular helices creates a closed vestibule where lateral portals are obstructed by loops. This 5-HT3 receptor structure, revealing part of the intracellular domain, expands the structural basis for understanding the operating mechanism of mammalian Cys-loop receptors.","Hassaine, Gherici; Deluz, Cedric; Grasso, Luigino; Wyss, Romain; Tol, Menno B.; Hovius, Ruud; Graff, Alexandra; Stahlberg, Henning; Tomizaki, Takashi; Desmyter, Aline; Moreau, Christophe; Li, Xiao-Dan; Poitevin, Frederic; Vogel, Horst; Nury, Hugues","Hassaine, G; Deluz, C; Grasso, L; Wyss, R; Tol, MB; Hovius, R; Graff, A; Stahlberg, H; Tomizaki, T; Desmyter, A; Moreau, C; Li, XD; Poitevin, F; Vogel, H; Nury, H",276.0,"[Hassaine, Gherici; Deluz, Cedric; Grasso, Luigino; Wyss, Romain; Tol, Menno B.; Hovius, Ruud; Vogel, Horst; Nury, Hugues] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lab Phys Chem Polymers & Membranes, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Graff, Alexandra; Stahlberg, Henning] Univ Basel, Biozentrum, Ctr Cellular Imaging & NanoAnalyt, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland; [Tomizaki, Takashi] Paul Scherrer Inst, Swiss Light Source, CH-5234 Villigen, Switzerland; [Desmyter, Aline] CNRS, UMR 7257, F-13288 Marseille, France; [Desmyter, Aline] Univ Aix Marseille, F-13288 Marseille, France; [Moreau, Christophe; Nury, Hugues] Univ Grenoble Alpes, IBS, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Moreau, Christophe; Nury, Hugues] CNRS, IBS, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Moreau, Christophe; Nury, Hugues] CEA, DSV, IBS, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Li, Xiao-Dan] Paul Scherrer Inst, Lab Biomol Res, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland; [Poitevin, Frederic] Inst Pasteur, CNRS, UMR3528, Unite Dynam Struct Macromol, F-75015 Paris, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13552,Article,1476-4687,horst.vogel@epfl.ch; hugues.nury@ibs.fr,+,Swiss National Science Foundation [31003A-133141]; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; European Community [211800]; Human Frontier Science Program; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (VenomPicoScreen project) [ANR-11-RPIB-022-04],"Research in the laboratory of H.

45,34,466.0,"Our perception of the environment relies on the capacity of neural networks to adapt rapidly to changes in incoming stimuli(1-4). It is increasingly being realized that the neural code is adaptive(5), that is, sensory neurons change their responses and selectivity in a dynamic manner to match the changes in input stimuli(1,2,5). Understanding how rapid exposure, or adaptation, to a stimulus of fixed structure changes information processing by cortical networks is essential for understanding the relationship between sensory coding and behaviour(5-8). Physiological investigations of adaptation have contributed greatly to our understanding of how individual sensory neurons change their responses to influence stimulus coding(2,9-12), yet whether and how adaptation affects information coding in neural populations is unknown. Here we examine how brief adaptation ( on the timescale of visual fixation)(2,9,10) influences the structure of interneuronal correlations and the accuracy of population coding in the macaque ( Macaca mulatta) primary visual cortex ( V1). We find that brief adaptation to a stimulus of fixed structure reorganizes the distribution of correlations across the entire network by selectively reducing their mean and variability. The post- adaptation changes in neuronal correlations are associated with specific, stimulus- dependent changes in the efficiency of the population code, and are consistent with changes in perceptual performance after adaptation(2,13,14). Our results have implications beyond the predictions of current theories of sensory coding, suggesting that brief adaptation improves the accuracy of population coding to optimize neuronal performance during natural viewing.","Gutnisky, Diego A.; Dragoi, Valentin","Gutnisky, DA; Dragoi, V",220.0,"[Gutnisky, Diego A.; Dragoi, Valentin] Univ Texas Houston, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol & Anat, Houston, TX 77030 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06563,Article,,v.dragoi@uth.tmc.edu,U63,,,273JG,,,ORIENTATION DISCRIMINATION; RAPID ADAPTATION; FIRING RATE; CORTEX; TRANSMISSION; VARIABILITY; STATISTICS; SYNCHRONY; DYNAMICS; MACAQUE,7184.0,NATURE,Nature,English,32.0,No,"Gutnisky, Diego/0000-0002-8578-0039","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",13-Mar,6.0,LONDON,18337822.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,"Gutnisky, Diego/E-3846-2012","Dragoi, V (reprint author), Univ Texas Houston, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol & Anat, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,142.0,Adaptive coding of visual information in neural populations,0.0,25.0,WOS:000253925600041,466.0,452,Multidisciplinary Sciences,142,valentin,dragoi,1992.0,299,male,1.0,WIw-G10AAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
46,132,207.0,"Animals locate and track chemoattractive gradients in the environment to find food. With its small nervous system, Caenorhabditis elegans is a good model system(1,2) in which to understand how the dynamics of neural activity control this search behaviour. Extensive work on the nematode has identified the neurons that are necessary for the different locomotory behaviours underlying chemotaxis through the use of laser ablation(3-7), activity recording in immobilized animals and the study of mutants(4,5). However, we do not know the neural activity patterns in C. elegans that are sufficient to control its complex chemotactic behaviour. To understand how the activity in its interneurons coordinate different motor programs to lead the animal to food, here we used optogenetics and new optical tools to manipulate neural activity directly in freely moving animals to evoke chemotactic behaviour. By deducing the classes of activity patterns triggered during chemotaxis and exciting individual neurons with these patterns, we identified interneurons that control the essential locomotory programs for this behaviour. Notably, we discovered that controlling the dynamics of activity in just one interneuron pair (AIY) was sufficient to force the animal to locate, turn towards and track virtual light gradients. Two distinct activity patterns triggered in AIY as the animal moved through the gradient controlled reversals and gradual turns to drive chemotactic behaviour. Because AIY neurons are post-synaptic to most chemosensory and thermosensory neurons(8), it is probable that these activity patterns in AIY have an important role in controlling and coordinating different taxis behaviours of the animal.","Kocabas, Askin; Shen, Ching-Han; Guo, Zengcai V.; Ramanathan, Sharad","Kocabas, A; Shen, CH; Guo, ZCV; Ramanathan, S",273.0,"[Kocabas, Askin; Shen, Ching-Han; Ramanathan, Sharad] Harvard Univ, FAS Ctr Syst Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kocabas, Askin; Shen, Ching-Han; Ramanathan, Sharad] Harvard Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Guo, Zengcai V.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA; [Ramanathan, Sharad] Allen Inst Brain Sci, Seattle, WA 98103 USA; [Ramanathan, Sharad] Harvard Univ, Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Ramanathan, Sharad] Harvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11431,Article,,akocabas@cgr.harvard.edu; sharad@post.harvard.edu,+,"Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP) Postdoctoral Fellowship; National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Fellowship; NSF Career Award; Pew Scholar, Klingenstein Fellowship Award; National Institutes of Health (NIH) Pioneer Awards","We thank J.

47,64,27.0,"Radiative transfer of energy at the nanometre length scale is of great importance to a variety of technologies including heat-assisted magnetic recording(1), near-field thermophotovoltaics(2) and lithography(3). Although experimental advances have enabled elucidation of near-field radiative heat transfer in gaps as small as 20-30 nanometres (refs 4-6), quantitative analysis in the extreme near field (less than 10 nanometres) has been greatly limited by experimental challenges. Moreover, the results of pioneering measurements(7,8) differed from theoretical predictions by orders of magnitude. Here we use custom-fabricated scanning probes with embedded thermocouples(9,10), in conjunction with new microdevices capable of periodic temperature modulation, to measure radiative heat transfer down to gaps as small as two nanometres. For our experiments we deposited suitably chosen metal or dielectric layers on the scanning probes and microdevices, enabling direct study of extreme near-field radiation between silica-silica, silicon nitride-silicon nitride and gold-gold surfaces to reveal marked, gap-size-dependent enhancements of radiative heat transfer. Furthermore, our state-of-the-art calculations of radiative heat transfer, performed within the theoretical framework of fluctuational electrodynamics, are in excellent agreement with our experimental results, providing unambiguous evidence that confirms the validity of this theory(11-13) for modelling radiative heat transfer in gaps as small as a few nanometres.

48,8,467.0,"Networks have become a key approach to understanding systems of interacting objects, unifying the study of diverse phenomena including biological organisms and human society(1-3). One crucial step when studying the structure and dynamics of networks is to identify communities(4,5): groups of related nodes that correspond to functional subunits such as protein complexes(6,7) or social spheres(8-10). Communities in networks often overlap(9,10) such that nodes simultaneously belong to several groups. Meanwhile, many networks are known to possess hierarchical organization, where communities are recursively grouped into a hierarchical structure(11-13). However, the fact that many real networks have communities with pervasive overlap, where each and every node belongs to more than one group, has the consequence that a global hierarchy of nodes cannot capture the relationships between overlapping groups. Here we reinvent communities as groups of links rather than nodes and show that this unorthodox approach successfully reconciles the antagonistic organizing principles of overlapping communities and hierarchy. In contrast to the existing literature, which has entirely focused on grouping nodes, link communities naturally incorporate overlap while revealing hierarchical organization. We find relevant link communities in many networks, including major biological networks such as protein-protein interaction(6,7,14) and metabolic networks(11,15,16), and show that a large social network(10,17,18) contains hierarchically organized community structures spanning inner-city to regional scales while maintaining pervasive overlap. Our results imply that link communities are fundamental building blocks that reveal overlap and hierarchical organization in networks to be two aspects of the same phenomenon.","Ahn, Yong-Yeol; Bagrow, James P.; Lehmann, Sune","Ahn, YY; Bagrow, JP; Lehmann, S",761.0,"[Lehmann, Sune] Harvard Univ, Inst Quantitat Social Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Ahn, Yong-Yeol; Bagrow, James P.] Northeastern Univ, Dept Phys, Ctr Complex Network Res, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Ahn, Yong-Yeol; Bagrow, James P.] Harvard Univ, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Ctr Canc Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Lehmann, Sune] Northeastern Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Sci, Boston, MA 02115 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09182,Article,1476-4687,sune.lehmann@gmail.com,U11,"James S.

49,78,431.0,"The tumour microenvironment may contribute to tumorigenesis owing to mechanical forces such as fibrotic stiffness or mechanical pressure caused by the expansion of hyper-proliferative cells(1,2). Here we explore the contribution of the mechanical pressure exerted by tumour growth onto non-tumorous adjacent epithelium. In the early stage of mouse colon tumour development in the Notch(+)Apc(+/1638N) mouse model, we observed mechanistic pressure stress in the non-tumorous epithelial cells caused by hyper-proliferative adjacent crypts overexpressing active Notch, which is associated with increased Ret and beta-catenin signalling. We thus developed a method that allows the delivery of a defined mechanical pressure in vivo, by subcutaneously inserting a magnet close to the mouse colon. The implanted magnet generated a magnetic force on ultra-magnetic liposomes, stabilized in the mesenchymal cells of the connective tissue surrounding colonic crypts after intravenous injection. The magnetically induced pressure quantitatively mimicked the endogenous early tumour growth stress in the order of 1,200 Pa, without affecting tissue stiffness, as monitored by ultrasound strain imaging and shear wave elastography. The exertion of pressure mimicking that of tumour growth led to rapid Ret activation and downstream phosphorylation of beta-catenin on Tyr654, imparing its interaction with the E-cadherin in adherens junctions, and which was followed by beta-catenin nuclear translocation after 15 days. As a consequence, increased expression of beta-catenin-target genes was observed at 1 month, together with crypt enlargement accompanying the formation of early tumorous aberrant crypt foci. Mechanical activation of the tumorigenic beta-catenin pathway suggests unexplored modes of tumour propagation based on mechanical signalling pathways in healthy epithelial cells surrounding the tumour, which may contribute to tumour heterogeneity.","Fernandez-Sanchez, Maria Elena; Barbier, Sandrine; Whitehead, Joanne; Bealle, Gaelle; Michel, Aude; Latorre-Ossa, Heldmuth; Rey, Colette; Fouassier, Laura; Claperon, Audrey; Brulle, Laura; Girard, Elodie; Servant, Nicolas; Rio-Frio, Thomas; Marie, Helene; Lesieur, Sylviane; Housset, Chantal; Gennisson, Jean-Luc; Tanter, Mickael; Menager, Christine; Fre, Silvia; Robine, Sylvie; Farge, Emmanuel","Fernandez-Sanchez, ME; Barbier, S; Whitehead, J; Bealle, G; Michel, A; Latorre-Ossa, H; Rey, C; Fouassier, L; Claperon, A; Brulle, L; Girard, E; Servant, N; Rio-Frio, T; Marie, H; Lesieur, S; Housset, C; Gennisson, JL; Tanter, M; Menager, C; Fre, S; Robine, S; Farge, E",92.0,"[Fernandez-Sanchez, Maria Elena; Barbier, Sandrine; Whitehead, Joanne; Farge, Emmanuel] PSL Res Univ, Fdn Pierre Gilles Gennes, CNRS UMR Physicochim Curie Mech & Genet Embryon &, Inst Curie,Ctr Rech,INSERM, F-75005 Paris, France; [Bealle, Gaelle; Michel, Aude; Menager, Christine] Univ Paris 04, UPMC, Lab PHENIX Physicochim Electrolytes & Nanosyst In, CNRS UMR 8234, F-75005 Paris, France; [Latorre-Ossa, Heldmuth; Gennisson, Jean-Luc; Tanter, Mickael] PSL Res Univ, Waves & Images ESPCI ParisTech, Langevin Inst, CNRS UMR7587,Inserm U979, F-75005 Paris, France; [Rey, Colette; Fouassier, Laura; Claperon, Audrey; Housset, Chantal] Univ Paris 04, UPMC, F-75012 Paris, France; [Rey, Colette; Fouassier, Laura; Claperon, Audrey; Housset, Chantal] INSERM, UMR S 938, CDR St Antoine, F-75012 Paris, France; [Brulle, Laura] Inst Curie, Ctr Rech, CNRS UMR3666, INSERM Endocyt Trafficking & Therapeut Delivery U, F-75005 Paris, France; [Girard, Elodie; Servant, Nicolas] Inst Curie, MINES ParisTech, Bioinformat Platform, U900, F-75005 Paris, France; [Rio-Frio, Thomas] Inst Curie, Next Generat Sequencing Platform, F-75005 Paris, France; [Marie, Helene; Lesieur, Sylviane] Univ Paris 11, Lab Physicochim Syst Polyphases, Fac Pharm, CNRS UMR 8612,Inst Galien Paris Sud,LabEx LERMIT, F-92296 Chatenay Malabry, France; [Fre, Silvia] Inst Curie, Unite Genet & Biol Dev, Notch Signaling Stem Cells & Tumors, CNRS UMR 3215,INSERM U934,Ctr Rech, F-75005 Paris, France; [Robine, Sylvie] Inst Curie, Ctr Rech, CNRS Compartimentat & Dynam Cellulaires Morphogen, F-75005 Paris, France",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14329,Article,1476-4687,efarge@curie.fr,+,"CNRS; INSERM; ARC [5030, 29324]; ANR [09PIRI0013-01, 11 BSV5014-01]; Labex CelTisPhyBio [11-LBX-0038]; Fonds CSP; Fondation Pierre-Gille de Gennes; Fondation de France; Inca [PLBIO13-172]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (investissements d'avenir) [ANR-10-EQPX-03, ANR10-INBS-09-08]; Canceropole Ile-de-France","This research was funded by the CNRS, INSERM, ARC (grant no.s 5030 and 29324), ANR (grant no.s 09PIRI0013-01 and 11 BSV5014-01), the Labex CelTisPhyBio (grant no. 11-LBX-0038), Fonds CSP, Fondation Pierre-Gille de Gennes, Fondation de France and the Inca (grant no.

50,22,484.0,"A common hallmark of human cancers is the overexpression of telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein complex that is responsible for maintaining the length and integrity of chromosome ends. Telomere length deregulation and telomerase activation is an early, and perhaps necessary, step in cancer cell evolution. Here we present the high- resolution structure of the Tribolium castaneum catalytic subunit of telomerase, TERT. The protein consists of three highly conserved domains, organized into a ring- like structure that shares common features with retroviral reverse transcriptases, viral RNA polymerases and B- family DNA polymerases. Domain organization places motifs implicated in substrate binding and catalysis in the interior of the ring, which can accommodate seven to eight bases of double- stranded nucleic acid. Modelling of an RNA - DNA heteroduplex in the interior of this ring demonstrates a perfect fit between the protein and the nucleic acid substrate, and positions the 39- end of the DNA primer at the active site of the enzyme, providing evidence for the formation of an active telomerase elongation complex.","Gillis, Andrew J.; Schuller, Anthony P.; Skordalakes, Emmanuel","Gillis, AJ; Schuller, AP; Skordalakes, E",633.0,"[Gillis, Andrew J.; Schuller, Anthony P.; Skordalakes, Emmanuel] Wistar Inst Anat & Biol, Gene Express & Regulat Program, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07283,Article,,skorda@wistar.org,U36,Pennsylvania Department of Health; The Ellison Medical Foundation,We thank R.

51,101,26.0,"The NRT1/PTR family of proton-coupled transporters are responsible for nitrogen assimilation in eukaryotes and bacteria through the uptake of peptides. However, in most plant species members of this family have evolved to transport nitrate as well as additional secondary metabolites and hormones. In response to falling nitrate levels, NRT1.1 is phosphorylated on an intracellular threonine that switches the transporter from a low-affinity to high-affinity state. Here we present both the apo and nitrate-bound crystal structures of Arabidopsis thaliana NRT1.1, which together with in vitro binding and transport data identify a key role for His 356 in nitrate binding. Our data support a model whereby phosphorylation increases structural flexibility and in turn the rate of transport. Comparison with peptide transporters further reveal show the NRT1/PTR family has evolved to recognize diverse nitrogenous ligands, while maintaining elements of a conserved coupling mechanism within this superfamily of nutrient transporters.","Parker, Joanne L.; Newstead, Simon","Parker, JL; Newstead, S",68.0,"[Parker, Joanne L.; Newstead, Simon] Univ Oxford, Dept Biochem, Oxford OX1 3QU, England; [Newstead, Simon] Rutherford Appleton Lab, Didcot OX11 0FA, Oxon, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13116,Article,1476-4687,joanne.parker@bioch.ox.ac.uk; simon.newstead@bioch.ox.ac.uk,+,"Medical Research Council (MRC) [G0900399]; Royal Society [RG110211, IE111401]","We thank R.

52,120,184.0,"Semaphorin 3A (Sema3A) is a diffusible axonal chemorepellent that has an important role in axon guidance(1-5). Previous studies have demonstrated that Sema3a(-/-) mice have multiple developmental defects due to abnormal neuronal innervations(6,7). Here we show in mice that Sema3A is abundantly expressed in bone, and cell-based assays showed that Sema3A affected osteoblast differentiation in a cell-autonomous fashion. Accordingly, Sema3a(-/-) mice had a low bone mass due to decreased bone formation. However, osteoblast-specific Sema3A-deficient mice (Sema3a(coli)(-/-) and Sema3a(osx)(-/-) mice) had normal bone mass, even though the expression of Sema3A in bone was substantially decreased. In contrast, mice lacking Sema3A in neurons (Sema3a(synapsin)(-/-) and Sema3a(nestin)(-/-) mice) had low bone mass, similar to Sema3a(-/-) mice, indicating that neuron-derived Sema3A is responsible for the observed bone abnormalities independent of the local effect of Sema3A in bone. Indeed, the number of sensory innervations of trabecular bone was significantly decreased in Sema3a(synapsin)(-/-) mice, whereas sympathetic innervations of trabecular bone were unchanged. Moreover, ablating sensory nerves decreased bone mass in wild-type mice, whereas it did not reduce the low bone mass in Sema3a(nestin)(-/-) mice further, supporting the essential role of the sensory nervous system in normal bone homeostasis. Finally, neuronal abnormalities in Sema3a(-/-) mice, such as olfactory development, were identified in Sema3a(synasin)(-/-) mice, demonstrating that neuron-derived Sema3A contributes to the abnormal neural development seen in Sema3a(-/-) mice, and indicating that Sema3A produced in neurons regulates neural development in an autocrine manner. This study demonstrates that Sema3A regulates bone remodelling indirectly by modulating sensory nerve development, but not directly by acting on osteoblasts.","Fukuda, Toru; Takeda, Shu; Xu, Ren; Ochi, Hiroki; Sunamura, Satoko; Sato, Tsuyoshi; Shibata, Shinsuke; Yoshida, Yutaka; Gu, Zirong; Kimura, Ayako; Ma, Chengshan; Xu, Cheng; Bando, Waka; Fujita, Koji; Shinomiya, Kenichi; Hirai, Takashi; Asou, Yoshinori; Enomoto, Mitsuhiro; Okano, Hideyuki; Okawa, Atsushi; Itoh, Hiroshi","Fukuda, T; Takeda, S; Xu, R; Ochi, H; Sunamura, S; Sato, T; Shibata, S; Yoshida, Y; Gu, ZR; Kimura, A; Ma, CS; Xu, C; Bando, W; Fujita, K; Shinomiya, K; Hirai, T; Asou, Y; Enomoto, M; Okano, H; Okawa, A; Itoh, H",490.0,"[Fukuda, Toru; Takeda, Shu; Ochi, Hiroki; Sunamura, Satoko] Keio Univ, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, Shinjyuku Ku, Tokyo 1608582, Japan; [Xu, Ren; Kimura, Ayako; Ma, Chengshan; Xu, Cheng; Fujita, Koji; Shinomiya, Kenichi; Hirai, Takashi; Asou, Yoshinori; Enomoto, Mitsuhiro; Okawa, Atsushi] Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Dept Orthoped Surg, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138549, Japan; [Xu, Ren; Ma, Chengshan; Xu, Cheng; Fujita, Koji; Okawa, Atsushi] Int Res Ctr Mol Sci Tooth & Bone Dis, Global Ctr Excellence GCOE Program, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138549, Japan; [Sato, Tsuyoshi] Saitama Med Univ, Dept Oral & Maxillofacial Surg, Moroyama, Saitama 3500495, Japan; [Shibata, Shinsuke; Okano, Hideyuki] Keio Univ, Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Shinjyuku Ku, Tokyo 1608582, Japan; [Yoshida, Yutaka; Gu, Zirong] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Dev Biol, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Kimura, Ayako] Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Hard Tissue Genome Res Ctr, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138549, Japan; [Bando, Waka; Itoh, Hiroshi] Keio Univ, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, Sect Nephrol Endocrinol & Metab,Shinjyuku Ku, Tokyo 1608582, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12115,Article,,shu-tky@umin.ac.jp,+,Funding Program for Next Generation World-Leading Researchers (NEXT Program); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke [NS065048],"We thank M.

53,113,398.0,"Sodium/proton (Na+/H+) antiporters, located at the plasma membrane in every cell, are vital for cell homeostasis1. In humans, their dysfunction has been linked to diseases, such as hypertension, heart failure and epilepsy, and they are well-established drug targets(2). The best understood model system for Na+/H+ antiport is NhaA from Escherichia coli(1,3), for which both electron microscopy and crystal structures are available(4-6). NhaA is made up of two distinct domains: a core domain and a dimerization domain. In the NhaA crystal structure a cavity is located between the two domains, providing access to the ion-binding site from the inward-facing surface of the protein(1,4). Likemany Na+/H+ antiporters, the activity of NhaA is regulated by pH, only becoming active above pH 6.5, at which point a conformational change is thought to occur(7). The only reported NhaA crystal structure so far is of the low pH inactivated form(4). Here we describe the active-state structure of a Na+/H+ antiporter, NapA from Thermus thermophilus, at 3 angstrom resolution, solved from crystals grown at pH7.8. In the NapA structure, the core and dimerization domains are in different positions to those seen in NhaA, and a negatively charged cavity has now opened to the outside. The extracellular cavity allows access to a strictly conserved aspartate residue thought to coordinate ion binding(1,8,9) directly, a role supported hereby molecular dynamics simulations. To alternate access to this ion-binding site, however, requires a surprisingly large rotation of the core domain, some 20 degrees against the dimerization interface. We conclude that despite their fast transport rates of up to 1,500 ions per second(3), Na+/H+ antiporters operate by a two-domain rocking bundle model, revealing themes relevant to secondary-active transporters in general.","Lee, Chiara; Kang, Hae Joo; von Ballmoos, Christoph; Newstead, Simon; Uzdavinys, Povilas; Dotson, David L.; Iwata, So; Beckstein, Oliver; Cameron, Alexander D.; Drew, David","Lee, C; Kang, HJ; von Ballmoos, C; Newstead, S; Uzdavinys, P; Dotson, DL; Iwata, S; Beckstein, O; Cameron, AD; Drew, D",573.0,"[Lee, Chiara; Kang, Hae Joo; Newstead, Simon; Iwata, So; Cameron, Alexander D.; Drew, David] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Div Mol Biosci, London SW7 2AZ, England; [von Ballmoos, Christoph; Uzdavinys, Povilas; Drew, David] Stockholm Univ, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Ctr Biomembrane Res, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Dotson, David L.; Beckstein, Oliver] Arizona State Univ, Dept Phys, Ctr Biol Phys, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Iwata, So; Cameron, Alexander D.] Membrane Prot Lab, Diamond Light Source, Chilton OX11 0DE, Oxon, England; [Iwata, So; Cameron, Alexander D.] Rutherford Appleton Lab, Didcot OX11 0FA, Oxon, England; [Cameron, Alexander D.] Univ Warwick, Sch Life Sci, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12484,Article,,a.cameron@warwick.ac.uk; d.drew@imperial.ac.uk,+,Medical Research Council (MRC) [G0900990]; Swedish Research Council; BBSRC [BB/G02325/1]; Wellcome Trust at the Diamond Light Source Limited [062164/Z/00/Z]; Centre for Biomembrane Research (CBR); Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research; XSEDE [TG-MCB120151]; Human Frontiers Science Program (HFSP); Royal Society through the University Research Fellow (URF) scheme,"We are grateful to D.

55,39,59.0,"A piezoelectric material is one that generates a voltage in response to a mechanical strain ( and vice versa). The most useful piezoelectric materials display a transition region in their composition phase diagrams, known as a morphotropic phase boundary(1,2), where the crystal structure changes abruptly and the electromechanical properties are maximal. As a result, modern piezoelectric materials for technological applications are usually complex, engineered, solid solutions, which complicates their manufacture as well as introducing complexity in the study of the microscopic origins of their properties. Here we show that even a pure compound, in this case lead titanate, can display a morphotropic phase boundary under pressure. The results are consistent with first-principles theoretical predictions(3), but show a richer phase diagram than anticipated; moreover, the predicted electromechanical coupling at the transition is larger than any known. Our results show that the high electromechanical coupling in solid solutions with lead titanate is due to tuning of the high- pressure morphotropic phase boundary in pure lead titanate to ambient pressure. We also find that complex microstructures or compositions are not necessary to obtain strong piezoelectricity. This opens the door to the possible discovery of high- performance, pure-compound electromechanical materials, which could greatly decrease costs and expand the utility of piezoelectric materials.","Ahart, Muhtar; Somayazulu, Maddury; Cohen, R.

56,65,103.0,"The mechanical properties of many materials are based on the macroscopic arrangement and orientation of their nanostructure. This nanostructure can be ordered over a range of length scales. In biology, the principle of hierarchical ordering is often used to maximize functionality, such as strength and robustness of the material, while minimizing weight and energy cost. Methods for nanoscale imaging provide direct visual access to the ultrastructure (nanoscale structure that is too small to be imaged using light microscopy), but the field of view is limited and does not easily allow a full correlative study of changes in the ultrastructure over a macroscopic sample. Other methods of probing ultrastructure ordering, such as small-angle scattering of X-rays or neutrons, can be applied to macroscopic samples; however, these scattering methods remain constrained to two-dimensional specimens(1-4) or to isotropically oriented ultrastructures(5-7). These constraints limit the use of these methods for studying nanostructures with more complex orientation patterns, which are abundant in nature and materials science. Here, we introduce an imaging method that combines small-angle scattering with tensor tomography to probe nanoscale structures in three-dimensional macroscopic samples in a non-destructive way. We demonstrate the method by measuring the main orientation and the degree of orientation of nanoscale mineralized collagen fibrils in a human trabecula bone sample with a spatial resolution of 25 micrometres. Symmetries within the sample, such as the cylindrical symmetry commonly observed for mineralized collagen fibrils in bone(8-10), allow for tractable sampling requirements and numerical efficiency. Small-angle scattering tensor tomography is applicable to both biological and materials science specimens, and may be useful for understanding and characterizing smart or bio-inspired materials. Moreover, because the method is non-destructive, it is appropriate for in situ measurements and allows, for example, the role of ultrastructure in the mechanical response of a biological tissue or manufactured material to be studied.","Liebi, Marianne; Georgiadis, Marios; Menzel, Andreas; Schneider, Philipp; Kohlbrecher, Joachim; Bunk, Oliver; Guizar-Sicairos, Manuel","Liebi, M; Georgiadis, M; Menzel, A; Schneider, P; Kohlbrecher, J; Bunk, O; Guizar-Sicairos, M",349.0,"[Liebi, Marianne; Menzel, Andreas; Kohlbrecher, Joachim; Bunk, Oliver; Guizar-Sicairos, Manuel] Paul Scherrer Inst, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland; [Georgiadis, Marios] ETH, Inst Biomech, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Schneider, Philipp] Univ Southampton, Bioengn Sci Res Grp, Fac Engn & Environm, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature16056,Article,1476-4687,marianne.liebi@psi.ch; manuel.guizar-sicairos@psi.ch,+,ETH Research Grant [ETH-39 11-1],"We thank M.

57,68,183.0,"The factors shaping cometary nuclei are still largely unknown, but could be the result of concurrent effects of evolutionary(1,2) and primordial processes(3,4). The peculiar bilobed shape of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko may be the result of the fusion of two objects that were once separate or the result of a localized excavation by outgassing at the interface between the two lobes(5). Here we report that the comet's major lobe is enveloped by a nearly continuous set of strata, up to 650 metres thick, which are independent of an analogous stratified envelope on the minor lobe. Gravity vectors computed for the two lobes separately are closer to perpendicular to the strata than those calculated for the entire nucleus and adjacent to the neck separating the two lobes. Therefore comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is an accreted body of two distinct objects with 'onion-like' stratification, which formed before they merged. We conclude that gentle, low-velocity collisions occurred between two fully formed kilometre-sized cometesimals in the early stages of the Solar System. The notable structural similarities between the two lobes of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko indicate that the early-forming cometesimals experienced similar primordial stratified accretion, even though they formed independently.","Massironi, Matteo; Simioni, Emanuele; Marzari, Francesco; Cremonese, Gabriele; Giacomini, Lorenza; Pajola, Maurizio; Jorda, Laurent; Naletto, Giampiero; Lowry, Stephen; El-Maarry, Mohamed Ramy; Preusker, Frank; Scholten, Frank; Sierks, Holger; Barbieri, Cesare; Lamy, Philippe; Rodrigo, Rafael; Koschny, Detlef; Rickman, Hans; Keller, Horst Uwe; A'Hearn, Michael F.; Agarwal, Jessica; Auger, Anne-Therese; Barucci, M.

58,121,266.0,"Slower recovery from perturbations near a tipping point and its indirect signatures in fluctuation patterns have been suggested to foreshadow catastrophes in a wide variety of systems(1,2). Recent studies of populations in the field and in the laboratory have used time-series data to confirm some of the theoretically predicted early warning indicators, such as an increase in recovery time or in the size and timescale of fluctuations(3-6). However, the predictive power of temporal warning signals is limited by the demand for long-term observations. Large-scale spatial data are more accessible, but the performance of warning signals in spatially extended systems(7-10) needs to be examined empirically(3,11-13). Here we use spatially extended yeast populations, an experimental system with a fold bifurcation (tipping point)(6), to evaluate early warning signals based on spatio-temporal fluctuations and to identify a novel spatial warning indicator. We found that two leading indicators based on fluctuations increased before collapse of connected populations; however, the magnitudes of the increases were smaller than those observed in isolated populations, possibly because local variation is reduced by dispersal. Furthermore, we propose a generic indicator based on deterministic spatial patterns, which we call 'recovery length'. As the spatial counterpart of recovery time(14), recovery length is the distance necessary for connected populations to recover from spatial perturbations. In our experiments, recovery length increased substantially before population collapse, suggesting that the spatial scale of recovery can provide a superior warning signal before tipping points in spatially extended systems.","Dai, Lei; Korolev, Kirill S.; Gore, Jeff","Dai, L; Korolev, KS; Gore, J",355.0,"[Dai, Lei; Korolev, Kirill S.; Gore, Jeff] MIT, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12071,Article,,dailei@mit.edu; gore@mit.edu,+,"Whitaker Health Sciences Fund Fellowship; Pappalardo Fellowship; NIH [NIH R00 GM085279-02, NIH DP2]; NSF CAREER Award; Sloan Research Fellowship; Pew Scholars Program; Allen Investigator Program","We would like to thank D.

59,32,443.0,"Molecular mechanisms regulating animal seasonal breeding in response to changing photoperiod are not well understood. Rapid induction of gene expression of thyroid- hormone- activating enzyme ( type 2 deiodinase, DIO2) in the mediobasal hypothalamus ( MBH) of the Japanese quail ( Coturnix japonica) is the earliest event yet recorded in the photoperiodic signal transduction pathway. Here we show cascades of gene expression in the quail MBH associated with the initiation of photoinduced secretion of luteinizing hormone. We identified two waves of gene expression. The first was initiated about 14 h after dawn of the first long day and included increased thyrotrophin ( TSH) beta- subunit expression in the pars tuberalis; the second occurred approximately 4 h later and included increased expression of DIO2. Intracerebroventricular ( ICV) administration of TSH to short- day quail stimulated gonadal growth and expression of DIO2 which was shown to be mediated through a TSH receptor - cyclic AMP ( cAMP) signalling pathway. Increased TSH in the pars tuberalis therefore seems to trigger long- day photoinduced seasonal breeding.","Nakao, Nobuhiro; Ono, Hiroko; Yamamura, Takashi; Anraku, Tsubasa; Takagi, Tsuyoshi; Higashi, Kumiko; Yasuo, Shinobu; Katou, Yasuhiro; Kageyama, Saburo; Uno, Yumiko; Kasukawa, Takeya; Iigo, Masayuki; Sharp, Peter J.; Iwasawa, Atsushi; Suzuki, Yutaka; Sugano, Sumio; Niimi, Teruyuki; Mizutani, Makoto; Namikawa, Takao; Ebihara, Shizufumi; Ueda, Hiroki R.; Yoshimura, Takashi","Nakao, N; Ono, H; Yamamura, T; Anraku, T; Takagi, T; Higashi, K; Yasuo, S; Katou, Y; Kageyama, S; Uno, Y; Kasukawa, T; Iigo, M; Sharp, PJ; Iwasawa, A; Suzuki, Y; Sugano, S; Niimi, T; Mizutani, M; Namikawa, T; Ebihara, S; Ueda, HR; Yoshimura, T",317.0,"[Nakao, Nobuhiro; Ono, Hiroko; Yamamura, Takashi; Anraku, Tsubasa; Takagi, Tsuyoshi; Higashi, Kumiko; Yasuo, Shinobu; Katou, Yasuhiro; Kageyama, Saburo; Uno, Yumiko; Ebihara, Shizufumi; Yoshimura, Takashi] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Bioagr Sci, Chikusa Ku, Div Biomodelling, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Kasukawa, Takeya; Ueda, Hiroki R.] RIKEN, Funct Genom Subunit, Ctr Dev Biol, Chuo Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan; [Iigo, Masayuki] Utsunomiya Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Appl Biochem, Utsunomiya, Tochigi 3218505, Japan; [Sharp, Peter J.] Univ Edinburgh, Div Genet & Genom, Roslin Inst, Roslin EH25 9PS, Midlothian, Scotland; [Sharp, Peter J.] Univ Edinburgh, Div Genet & Genom, Royal Dick Sch Vet Studies, Roslin EH25 9PS, Midlothian, Scotland; [Iwasawa, Atsushi] Gifu Univ, Lab Comparat Biochem, Grad Sch Appl Biol Sci, Gifu 5011193, Japan; [Suzuki, Yutaka; Sugano, Sumio] Univ Tokyo, Dept Med Genome Sci, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; [Niimi, Teruyuki] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Bioagr Sci, Chikusa Ku, Div Biofunct Dev, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Mizutani, Makoto; Namikawa, Takao; Ebihara, Shizufumi; Yoshimura, Takashi] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Bioagr Sci, Chikusa Ku, Avian Biosci Res Ctr, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Ueda, Hiroki R.] RIKEN, Lab Syst Biol, Ctr Dev Biol, Chuo Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan; [Yoshimura, Takashi] Nagoya Univ, Chikusa Ku, Inst Adv Res, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06738,Article,,takashiy@agr.nagoya-u.ac.jp,U1,,,276BX,,,II IODOTHYRONINE DEIODINASE; COTURNIX-COTURNIX-JAPONICA; JAPANESE-QUAIL; CHICKEN THYROTROPIN; GENE-EXPRESSION; CIRCADIAN CLOCK; BETA-SUBUNIT; HORMONE; RECEPTOR; BRAIN,7185.0,NATURE,Nature,English,39.0,No,"Yoshimura, Takashi/0000-0001-7018-9652; Kasukawa, Takeya/0000-0001-5085-0802","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",20-Mar,7.0,LONDON,18354476.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,"Yoshimura, Takashi/C-8306-2012; Ueda, Hiroki/C-5037-2014; Kasukawa, Takeya/N-5070-2015","Yoshimura, T (reprint author), Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Bioagr Sci, Chikusa Ku, Div Biomodelling, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,233.0,Thyrotrophin in the pars tuberalis triggers photoperiodic response,0.0,48.0,WOS:000254117400039,443.0,452,Multidisciplinary Sciences,240,takashi,yoshimura,2197.0,16,male,1.0,70uGLR0AAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",34529736,1,18969,1,Tempest 3D,Tempest 3D,0,0
60,59,355.0,"Endogenous retroviruses are a common ancestral feature of mammalian genomes with most having been inactivated over time through mutation and deletion(1). A group of more intact endogenous retroviruses are considered to have entered the genomes of some species more recently, through infection by exogenous viruses(2), but this event has never been directly proved. We have previously reported koala retrovirus (KoRV) to be a functional virus that is associated with neoplasia(3). Here we show that KoRV also shows features of a recently inserted endogenous retrovirus that is vertically transmitted. The finding that some isolated koala populations have not yet incorporated KoRV into their genomes, combined with its high level of activity and variability in individual koalas, suggests that KoRV is a virus in transition between an exogenous and endogenous element. This ongoing dynamic interaction with a wild species provides an exciting opportunity to study the process and consequences of retroviral endogenization in action, and is an attractive model for studying the evolutionary event in which a retrovirus invades a mammalian genome.","Tarlinton, RE; Meers, J; Young, PR","Tarlinton, RE; Meers, J; Young, PR",79.0,"Univ Queensland, Sch Mol & Microbial Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; Univ Queensland, Sch Vet Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature04841,Article,,p.young@uq.edu.au,81,,,059HS,,,GERM LINE INTEGRATION; APE LEUKEMIA-VIRUS; ENDOGENOUS RETROVIRUSES; IDENTIFICATION; PROVIRUSES; MICE,7098.0,NATURE,Nature,English,21.0,No,"Tarlinton, Rachael/0000-0003-3325-2311; Young, Paul/0000-0002-2040-5190","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",6-Jul,3.0,LONDON,16823453.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,"Meers, Joanne/B-4141-2011; Tarlinton, Rachael/H-1712-2011; Young, Paul/A-6176-2010","Young, PR (reprint author), Univ Queensland, Sch Mol & Microbial Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,168.0,Retroviral invasion of the koala genome,2.0,67.0,WOS:000238724500040,355.0,442,Multidisciplinary Sciences,173,pr,young,1808.0,3,male,1.0,hYa6-bMAAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",23866706,1,5405,1,PR interval,PR interval,0,0
61,183,172.0,"Polypeptide toxins have played a central part in understanding physiological and physiopathological functions of ion channels(1,2). In the field of pain, they led to important advances in basic research(3-6) and even to clinical applications(7,8). Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are generally considered principal players in the pain pathway(9), including in humans(10). A snake toxin activating peripheral ASICs in nociceptive neurons has been recently shown to evoke pain(11). Here we show that a new class of three-finger peptides from another snake, the black mamba, is able to abolish pain through inhibition of ASICs expressed either in central or peripheral neurons. These peptides, which we call mambalgins, are not toxic in mice but show a potent analgesic effect upon central and peripheral injection that can be as strong as morphine. This effect is, however, resistant to naloxone, and mambalgins cause much less tolerance than morphine and no respiratory distress. Pharmacological inhibition by mambalgins combined with the use of knockdown and knockout animals indicates that blockade of heteromeric channels made of ASIC1a and ASIC2a subunits in central neurons and of ASIC1b-containing channels in nociceptors is involved in the analgesic effect of mambalgins. These findings identify new potential therapeutic targets for pain and introduce natural peptides that block them to produce a potent analgesia.","Diochot, Sylvie; Baron, Anne; Salinas, Miguel; Douguet, Dominique; Scarzello, Sabine; Dabert-Gay, Anne-Sophie; Debayle, Delphine; Friend, Valerie; Alloui, Abdelkrim; Lazdunski, Michel; Lingueglia, Eric","Diochot, S; Baron, A; Salinas, M; Douguet, D; Scarzello, S; Dabert-Gay, AS; Debayle, D; Friend, V; Alloui, A; Lazdunski, M; Lingueglia, E",552.0,"[Diochot, Sylvie; Baron, Anne; Salinas, Miguel; Douguet, Dominique; Scarzello, Sabine; Dabert-Gay, Anne-Sophie; Debayle, Delphine; Friend, Valerie; Lazdunski, Michel; Lingueglia, Eric] CNRS, Inst Pharmacol Mol & Cellulaire, UMR 7275, F-06560 Valbonne, France; [Diochot, Sylvie; Baron, Anne; Salinas, Miguel; Douguet, Dominique; Scarzello, Sabine; Dabert-Gay, Anne-Sophie; Debayle, Delphine; Friend, Valerie; Lazdunski, Michel; Lingueglia, Eric] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, F-06560 Valbonne, France; [Diochot, Sylvie; Baron, Anne; Salinas, Miguel; Friend, Valerie; Lingueglia, Eric] LabEx Ion Channel Sci & Therapeut, F-06560 Valbonne, France; [Alloui, Abdelkrim] Univ Auvergne, Clermont Univ, NEURO DOL, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Alloui, Abdelkrim] INSERM, U1107, F-63001 Clermont Ferrand, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11494,Article,,baron@ipmc.cnrs.fr; lingueglia@ipmc.cnrs.fr,+,Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale; Association Francaise contre les Myopathies; Agence Nationale de la Recherche; EMMAservice under European Union of the EC FP7 Capacities Specific Programme [227490],"We are grateful to M.

62,15,383.0,"The reliable detection of single quantum particles has revolutionized the field of quantum optics and quantum information processing. For several years, researchers have aspired to extend such detection possibilities to larger-scale, strongly correlated quantum systems(1,2) in order to record in situ images of a quantum fluid in which each underlying quantum particle is detected. Here we report fluorescence imaging of strongly interacting bosonic Mott insulators in an optical lattice with single-atom and single-site resolution. From our images, we fully reconstruct the atom distribution on the lattice and identify individual excitations with high fidelity. A comparison of the radial density and variance distributions with theory provides a precise in situ temperature and entropy measurement from single images. We observe Mott-insulating plateaus with near-zero entropy and clearly resolve the high-entropy rings separating them, even though their width is of the order of just a single lattice site. Furthermore, we show how a Mott insulator melts with increasing temperature, owing to a proliferation of local defects. The ability to resolve individual lattice sites directly opens up new avenues for the manipulation, analysis and applications of strongly interacting quantum gases on a lattice. For example, one could introduce local perturbations or access regions of high entropy, a crucial requirement for the implementation of novel cooling schemes(3).","Sherson, Jacob F.; Weitenberg, Christof; Endres, Manuel; Cheneau, Marc; Bloch, Immanuel; Kuhr, Stefan","Sherson, JF; Weitenberg, C; Endres, M; Cheneau, M; Bloch, I; Kuhr, S",68.0,"[Sherson, Jacob F.; Weitenberg, Christof; Endres, Manuel; Cheneau, Marc; Bloch, Immanuel; Kuhr, Stefan] Max Planck Inst Quantum Opt, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Bloch, Immanuel] Univ Munich, D-80799 Munich, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09378,Article,,stefan.kuhr@mpq.mpg.de,U97,MPG; DFG; Stiftung Rheinland-Pfalz fur Innovation; Carl-Zeiss Stiftung; EU,"We thank R.

63,169,160.0,"Single-neuron activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is tuned to mixtures of multiple task-related aspects. Such mixed selectivity is highly heterogeneous, seemingly disordered and therefore difficult to interpret. We analysed the neural activity recorded in monkeys during an object sequence memory task to identify a role of mixed selectivity in subserving the cognitive functions ascribed to the PFC. We show that mixed selectivity neurons encode distributed information about all task-relevant aspects. Each aspect can be decoded from the population of neurons even when single-cell selectivity to that aspect is eliminated. Moreover, mixed selectivity offers a significant computational advantage over specialized responses in terms of the repertoire of input-output functions implementable by readout neurons. This advantage originates from the highly diverse nonlinear selectivity to mixtures of task-relevant variables, a signature of high-dimensional neural representations. Crucially, this dimensionality is predictive of animal behaviour as it collapses in error trials. Our findings recommend a shift of focus for future studies from neurons that have easily interpretable response tuning to the widely observed, but rarely analysed, mixed selectivity neurons.","Rigotti, Mattia; Barak, Omri; Warden, Melissa R.; Wang, Xiao-Jing; Daw, Nathaniel D.; Miller, Earl K.; Fusi, Stefano","Rigotti, M; Barak, O; Warden, MR; Wang, XJ; Daw, ND; Miller, EK; Fusi, S",585.0,"[Rigotti, Mattia; Barak, Omri; Fusi, Stefano] Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, Ctr Theoret Neurosci, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Rigotti, Mattia; Wang, Xiao-Jing; Daw, Nathaniel D.] NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Rigotti, Mattia; Daw, Nathaniel D.] NYU, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Warden, Melissa R.; Miller, Earl K.] MIT, Picower Inst Learning & Memory, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Warden, Melissa R.; Miller, Earl K.] MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Warden, Melissa R.] Stanford Univ, Dept Bioengn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Wang, Xiao-Jing] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Kavli Inst Neurosci, New Haven, CT 06525 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12160,Article,,sf2237@columbia.edu,590,Gatsby Foundation; Swartz Foundation; Kavli Foundation; Swiss National Science Foundation [PBSKP3-133357]; Janggen-Poehn Foundation; McKnight Foundation; McDonnell Foundation; NIMH [5-R37-MH087027-04]; Picower Foundation; Brain & Behavior Research Foundation; NARSAD,"We are grateful to L.F.

Here we report the single-cell- and metagenomics-based discovery of such producers. Two phylotypes of the candidate genus 'Entotheonella' with genomes of greater than 9 megabases and multiple, distinct biosynthetic gene clusters co-inhabit the chemically and microbially rich marine sponge Theonella swinhoei. Almost all bioactive polyketides and peptides known from this animal were attributed to a single phylotype. 'Entotheonella' spp. are widely distributed in sponges and belong to an environmental taxon proposed here as candidate phylum 'Tectomicrobia'.

65,96,156.0,"Neuroblastoma is a malignant paediatric tumour of the sympathetic nervous system(1). Roughly half of these tumours regress spontaneously or are cured by limited therapy. By contrast, high-risk neuroblastomas have an unfavourable clinical course despite intensive multimodal treatment, and their molecular basis has remained largely elusive(2-4). Here we have performed whole-genome sequencing of 56 neuroblastomas (high-risk, n = 39; low-risk, n = 17) and discovered recurrent genomic rearrangements affecting a chromosomal region at 5p15.33 proximal of the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (TERT). These rearrangements occurred only in high-risk neuroblastomas (12/39, 31%) in a mutually exclusive fashion with MYCN amplifications and ATRX mutations, which are known genetic events in this tumour type(1,2,5). In an extended case series (n = 217), TERT rearrangements defined a subgroup of high-risk tumours with particularly poor outcome. Despite a large structural diversity of these rearrangements, they all induced massive transcriptional upregulation of TERT. In the remaining high-risk tumours, TERT expression was also elevated in MYCN-amplified tumours, whereas alternative lengthening of telomeres was present in neuroblastomas without TERT or MYCN alterations, suggesting that telomere lengthening represents a central mechanism defining this subtype. The 5p15.33 rearrangements juxtapose the TERT coding sequence to strong enhancer elements, resulting in massive chromatin remodelling and DNA methylation of the affected region. Supporting a functional role of TERT, neuroblastoma cell lines bearing rearrangements or amplified MYCN exhibited both upregulated TERT expression and enzymatic telomerase activity. In summary, our findings show that remodelling of the genomic context abrogates transcriptional silencing of TERT in high-risk neuroblastoma and places telomerase activation in the centre of transformation in a large fraction of these tumours.","Peifer, Martin;

66,159,428.0,"More than 130 million people worldwide chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) are at risk of developing severe liver disease. Antiviral treatments are only partially effective against HCV infection, and a vaccine is not available. Development of more efficient therapies has been hampered by the lack of a small animal model. Building on the observation that CD81 and occludin (OCLN) comprise the minimal set of human factors required to render mouse cells permissive to HCV entry(1), we previously showed that transient expression of these two human genes is sufficient to allow viral uptake into fully immunocompetent inbred mice(2). Here we demonstrate that transgenic mice stably expressing human CD81 and OCLN also support HCV entry, but innate and adaptive immune responses restrict HCV infection in vivo. Blunting antiviral immunity in genetically humanized mice infected with HCV results in measurable viraemia over several weeks. In mice lacking the essential cellular cofactor cyclophilin A (CypA), HCV RNA replication is markedly diminished, providing genetic evidence that this process is faithfully recapitulated. Using a cell-based fluorescent reporter activated by the NS3-4A protease we visualize HCV infection in single hepatocytes in vivo. Persistently infected mice produce de novo infectious particles, which can be inhibited with directly acting antiviral drug treatment, thereby providing evidence for the completion of the entire HCV life cycle in inbred mice. This genetically humanized mouse model opens new opportunities to dissect genetically HCV infection in vivo and provides an important preclinical platform for testing and prioritizing drug candidates and may also have utility for evaluating vaccine efficacy.","Dorner, Marcus; Horwitz, Joshua A.; Donovan, Bridget M.; Labitt, Rachael N.; Budell, William C.; Friling, Tamar; Vogt, Alexander; Catanese, Maria Teresa; Satoh, Takashi; Kawai, Taro; Akira, Shizuo; Law, Mansun; Rice, Charles M.; Ploss, Alexander","Dorner, M; Horwitz, JA; Donovan, BM; Labitt, RN; Budell, WC; Friling, T; Vogt, A; Catanese, MT; Satoh, T; Kawai, T; Akira, S; Law, M; Rice, CM; Ploss, A",237.0,"[Dorner, Marcus; Horwitz, Joshua A.; Donovan, Bridget M.; Labitt, Rachael N.; Budell, William C.; Friling, Tamar; Vogt, Alexander; Catanese, Maria Teresa; Rice, Charles M.; Ploss, Alexander] Rockefeller Univ, Ctr Study Hepatitis C, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Satoh, Takashi; Kawai, Taro; Akira, Shizuo] Osaka Univ, WPI Immunol Frontier Res Ctr, Lab Host Def, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Law, Mansun] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Immunol & Microbial Sci, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12427,Article,,ricec@rockefeller.edu; aploss@princeton.edu,+,"National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases [RC1DK087193]; National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease [R01AI072613, R01AI099284]; National Cancer Institute [R01CA057973]; The Starr Foundation; Greenberg Medical Research Institute; Richard Salomon Family Foundation; Ronald A.

67,131,350.0,"The silkworm Bombyx mori uses a WZ sex determination system that is analogous to the one found in birds and some reptiles. In this system, males have two Z sex chromosomes, whereas females have Z and W sex chromosomes. The silkworm W chromosome has a dominant role in female determination(1,2), suggesting the existence of a dominant feminizing gene in this chromosome. However, the W chromosomeis almost fully occupied by transposable element sequences(3-5), and no functional protein-coding gene has been identified so far. Female-enriched PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are the only known transcripts that are produced from the sex-determining region of the W chromosome(6), but the function(s) of these piRNAs are unknown. Here we show that a W-chromosome-derived, female-specific piRNA is the feminizing factor of B. mori. This piRNA is produced from a piRNA precursor which we named Fem. Fem sequences were arranged in tandem in the sex-determining region of the W chromosome. Inhibition of Fem-derived piRNA-mediated signalling in female embryos led to the production of the male-specific splice variants of B. mori doublesex (Bmdsx), a gene which acts at the downstream end of the sex differentiation cascade(7,8). A target gene of Fem-derived piRNA was identified on the Z chromosome of B. mori. This gene, which we named Masc, encoded a CCCH-type zinc finger protein. We show that the silencing of Masc messenger RNA by Fem piRNA is required for the production of female-specific isoforms of Bmdsx in female embryos, and that Masc protein controls both dosage compensation and masculinization in male embryos. Our study characterizes a single small RNA that is responsible for primary sex determination in the WZ sex determination system.","Kiuchi, Takashi; Koga, Hikaru; Kawamoto, Munetaka; Shoji, Keisuke; Sakai, Hiroki; Arai, Yuji; Ishihara, Genki; Kawaoka, Shinpei; Sugano, Sumio; Shimada, Toru; Suzuki, Yutaka; Suzuki, Masataka G.; Katsuma, Susumu","Kiuchi, T; Koga, H; Kawamoto, M; Shoji, K; Sakai, H; Arai, Y; Ishihara, G; Kawaoka, S; Sugano, S; Shimada, T; Suzuki, Y; Suzuki, MG; Katsuma, S",633.0,"[Kiuchi, Takashi; Koga, Hikaru; Kawamoto, Munetaka; Shoji, Keisuke; Arai, Yuji; Ishihara, Genki; Kawaoka, Shinpei; Shimada, Toru; Katsuma, Susumu] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Dept Agr & Environm Biol, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138657, Japan; [Sakai, Hiroki; Suzuki, Masataka G.] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Dept Integrated Biosci, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778562, Japan; [Sugano, Sumio; Suzuki, Yutaka] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Dept Med Genome Sci, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088639, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13315,Article,1476-4687,katsuma@ss.ab.a.u-tokyo.ac.jp,+,Program for Promotion of Basic and Applied Researches for Innovations in Bio-oriented Industry;  [22115502];  [22128004],We thank S.

68,154,346.0,"Nucleic-acid-binding proteins are generally viewed as either specific or nonspecific, depending on characteristics of their binding sites in DNA or RNA(1,2). Most studies have focused on specific proteins, which identify cognate sites by binding with highest affinities to regions with defined signatures in sequence, structure or both(1-4). Proteins that bind to sites devoid of defined sequence or structure signatures are considered nonspecific(1,2,5). Substrate binding by these proteins is poorly understood, and it is not known to what extent seemingly nonspecific proteins discriminate between different binding sites, aside from those sequestered by nucleic acid structures(6). Here we systematically examine substrate binding by the apparently nonspecific RNA-binding protein C5, and find clear discrimination between different binding site variants. C5 is the protein subunit of the transfer RNA processing ribonucleoprotein enzyme RNase P from Escherichia coli. The protein binds 59 leaders of precursor tRNAs at a site without sequence or structure signatures. We measure functional binding of C5 to all possible sequence variants in its substrate binding site, using a high-throughput sequencing kinetics approach (HITS-KIN) that simultaneously follows processing of thousands of RNA species. C5 binds different substrate variants with affinities varying by orders of magnitude. The distribution of functional affinities of C5 for all substrate variants resembles affinity distributions of highly specific nucleic acid binding proteins. Unlike these specific proteins, C5 does not bind its physiological RNA targets with the highest affinity, but with affinities near the median of the distribution, a region that is not associated with a sequence signature. We delineate defined rules governing substrate recognition by C5, which reveal specificity that is hidden in cellular substrates for RNase P. Our findings suggest that apparently nonspecific and specific RNA-binding modes may not differ fundamentally, but represent distinct parts of common affinity distributions.","Guenther, Ulf-Peter; Yandek, Lindsay E.; Niland, Courtney N.; Campbell, Frank E.; Anderson, David; Anderson, Vernon E.; Harris, Michael E.; Jankowsky, Eckhard","Guenther, UP; Yandek, LE; Niland, CN; Campbell, FE; Anderson, D; Anderson, VE; Harris, ME; Jankowsky, E",385.0,"[Guenther, Ulf-Peter; Campbell, Frank E.; Jankowsky, Eckhard] Case Western Reserve Univ, Ctr RNA Mol Biol, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Guenther, Ulf-Peter; Yandek, Lindsay E.; Niland, Courtney N.; Anderson, Vernon E.; Harris, Michael E.; Jankowsky, Eckhard] Case Western Reserve Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Anderson, David] CUNY, Baruch Coll, Zicklin Sch Business, Dept Management, New York, NY 10010 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12543,Article,1476-4687,meh2@case.edu; exj13@case.edu,+,"US National Institutes of Health (NIH) [GM067700, GM099720, CSTA UL1RR024989, GM056740, GM096000, T32 GM008056]; DFG","We particularly thank T.

At a broader system level, ICTs influence economic growth and bring about technological and societal change. Managing the direct impacts of ICTs is more complex than just producing efficient devices, owing to the energetically expensive manufacturing process, and the increasing proliferation of devices needs to be taken into account.","Williams, Eric","Williams, E",354.0,"Rochester Inst Technol, Golisano Inst Sustainabil, Rochester, NY 14623 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10682,Article,,exwgis@rit.edu,358,US National Science Foundation [CBET-0731067],This work was in supported in part by the US National Science Foundation via grant CBET-0731067 in the Environmental Sustainability program.,848OA,,,INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY; FLAME RETARDANTS; ENERGY; CONSUMPTION; MICROCHIP; COMPUTER; IMPACTS; INPUT,7373.0,NATURE,Nature,English,53.0,No,"Williams, Eric/0000-0002-6352-2928","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",17-Nov,5.0,LONDON,22094696.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2011.0,"Williams, Eric/J-4282-2012","Williams, E (reprint author), Rochester Inst Technol, Golisano Inst Sustainabil, Rochester, NY 14623 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,43.0,Environmental effects of information and communications technologies,5.0,53.0,WOS:000297059700036,434.0,479,Multidisciplinary Sciences,43,eric,williams,5203.0,4110,male,1.0,MKUHQhsAAAAJ,3,"(4126, 9345]",50252,1,11922554,1,Eric Williams,Eric Williams,1,1
70,126,263.0,"Galaxies are believed to evolve through merging(1), which should lead to some hosting multiple supermassive black holes(2-4). There are four known triple black hole systems(5-8), with the closest black hole pair being 2.4 kiloparsecs apart (the third component in this system is at 3 kiloparsecs)(7), which is far from the gravitational sphere of influence (about 100 parsecs for a black hole with mass one billion times that of the Sun). Previous searches for compact black hole systems concluded that they were rare(9), with the tightest binary system having a separation of 7 parsecs (ref. 10). Here we report observations of a triple black hole system at redshift z = 0.39, with the closest pair separated by about 140 parsecs and significantly more distant from Earth than any other known binary of comparable orbital separation. The effect of the tight pair is to introduce a rotationally symmetric helical modulation on the structure of the large-scale radio jets, which provides a useful way to search for other tight pairs without needing extremely high resolution observations. As we found this tight pair after searching only six galaxies, we conclude that tight pairs are more common than hitherto believed, which is an important observational constraint for low-frequency gravitational wave experiments(11,12).","Deane, R.

72,4,96.0,"Imprinted genes, defined by their preferential expression of a single parental allele, represent a subset of the mammalian genome and often have key roles in embryonic development(1), but also postnatal functions including energy homeostasis(2) and behaviour(3,4). When the two parental alleles are unequally represented within a social group (when there is sex bias in dispersal and/or variance in reproductive success)(5,6), imprinted genes may evolve to modulate social behaviour, although so far no such instance is known. Predominantly expressed from the maternal allele during embryogenesis, Grb10 encodes an intracellular adaptor protein that can interact with several receptor tyrosine kinases and downstream signalling molecules(7). Here we demonstrate that within the brain Grb10 is expressed from the paternal allele from fetal life into adulthood and that ablation of this expression engenders increased social dominance specifically among other aspects of social behaviour, a finding supported by the observed increase in allogrooming by paternal Grb10-deficient animals. Grb10 is, therefore, the first example of an imprinted gene that regulates social behaviour. It is also currently alone in exhibiting imprinted expression from each of the parental alleles in a tissue-specific manner, as loss of the peripherally expressed maternal allele leads to significant fetal and placental overgrowth. Thus Grb10 is, so far, a unique imprinted gene, able to influence distinct physiological processes, fetal growth and adult behaviour, owing to actions of the two parental alleles in different tissues.","Garfield, Alastair S.; Cowley, Michael; Smith, Florentia M.; Moorwood, Kim; Stewart-Cox, Joanne E.; Gilroy, Kerry; Baker, Sian; Xia, Jing; Dalley, Jeffrey W.; Hurst, Laurence D.; Wilkinson, Lawrence S.; Isles, Anthony R.; Ward, Andrew","Garfield, AS; Cowley, M; Smith, FM; Moorwood, K; Stewart-Cox, JE; Gilroy, K; Baker, S; Xia, J; Dalley, JW; Hurst, LD; Wilkinson, LS; Isles, AR; Ward, A",534.0,"[Garfield, Alastair S.; Cowley, Michael; Smith, Florentia M.; Moorwood, Kim; Stewart-Cox, Joanne E.; Hurst, Laurence D.; Ward, Andrew] Univ Bath, Dept Biol & Biochem, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Garfield, Alastair S.; Cowley, Michael; Smith, Florentia M.; Moorwood, Kim; Stewart-Cox, Joanne E.; Hurst, Laurence D.; Ward, Andrew] Univ Bath, Ctr Regenerat Med, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Garfield, Alastair S.; Gilroy, Kerry; Baker, Sian; Wilkinson, Lawrence S.; Isles, Anthony R.] Cardiff Univ, Sch Med, Neurosci & Mental Hlth Res Inst, MRC,Ctr Neuropsychiat Genet & Genom,Behav Genet G, Cardiff CF14 4XN, S Glam, Wales; [Garfield, Alastair S.; Gilroy, Kerry; Baker, Sian; Wilkinson, Lawrence S.; Isles, Anthony R.] Cardiff Univ, Sch Psychol, Neurosci & Mental Hlth Res Inst, MRC,Ctr Neuropsychiat Genet & Genom,Behav Genet G, Cardiff CF14 4XN, S Glam, Wales; [Xia, Jing; Dalley, Jeffrey W.] Univ Cambridge, Behav & Clin Neurosci Inst, Cambridge CB2 3EB, England; [Xia, Jing; Dalley, Jeffrey W.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Expt Psychol, Cambridge CB2 3EB, England; [Dalley, Jeffrey W.] Univ Cambridge, Addenbrookes Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Cambridge CB2 2QQ, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09651,Article,,bssaw@bath.ac.uk,U101,Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council; Medical Research Council; Wellcome Trust,"We thank S.

73,59,52.0,"The future paths of population ageing result from specific combinations of declining fertility and increasing life expectancies in different parts of the world(1). Here we measure the speed of population ageing by using conventional measures and new ones that take changes in longevity into account for the world as a whole and for 13 major regions. We report on future levels of indicators of ageing and the speed at which they change. We show how these depend on whether changes in life expectancy are taken into account. We also show that the speed of ageing is likely to increase over the coming decades and to decelerate in most regions by mid-century. All our measures indicate a continuous ageing of the world's population throughout the century. The median age of the world's population increases from 26.6 years in 2000 to 37.3 years in 2050 and then to 45.6 years in 2100, when it is not adjusted for longevity increase. When increases in life expectancy are taken into account(2,3), the adjusted median age rises from 26.6 in 2000 to 31.1 in 2050 and only to 32.9 in 2100, slightly less than what it was in the China region in 2005. There are large differences in the regional patterns of ageing. In North America, the median age adjusted for life expectancy change falls throughout almost the entire century, whereas the conventional median age increases significantly. Our assessment of trends in ageing is based on new probabilistic population forecasts. The probability that growth in the world's population will end during this century is 88%, somewhat higher than previously assessed(4). After mid- century, lower rates of population growth are likely to coincide with slower rates of ageing.","Lutz, Wolfgang; Sanderson, Warren; Scherbov, Sergei","Lutz, W; Sanderson, W; Scherbov, S",716.0,"[Lutz, Wolfgang; Sanderson, Warren; Scherbov, Sergei] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, World Populat Program, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Lutz, Wolfgang; Scherbov, Sergei] Austrian Acad Sci, Vienna Inst Demog, A-1040 Vienna, Austria; [Sanderson, Warren] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Econ, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Sanderson, Warren] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Hist, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06516,Article,,lutz@iiasa.ac.at,719,,,259HD,Y,N,LIFE EXPECTANCY; DEMOGRAPHY; MORTALITY; LIMITS,7179.0,NATURE,Nature,English,19.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",7-Feb,4.0,LONDON,18204438.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,,"Lutz, W (reprint author), Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, World Populat Program, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,392.0,The coming acceleration of global population ageing,7.0,92.0,WOS:000252929500041,52.0,451,Multidisciplinary Sciences,403,sergei,scherbov,4961.0,38,male,0.97,qxDURIsAAAAJ,3,"(4126, 9345]",41324581,1,41324581,1,Sergei Scherbov,Sergei Scherbov,1,1
74,97,174.0,"It remains unclear whether biodiversity buffers ecosystems against climate extremes, which are becoming increasingly frequent worldwide(1). Early results suggested that the ecosystem productivity of diverse grassland plant communities was more resistant, changing less during drought, and more resilient, recovering more quickly after drought, than that of depauperate communities(2). However, subsequent experimental tests produced mixed results(3-13). Here we use data from 46 experiments that manipulated grassland plant diversity to test whether biodiversity provides resistance during and resilience after climate events. We show that biodiversity increased ecosystem resistance for a broad range of climate events, including wet or dry, moderate or extreme, and brief or prolonged events. Across all studies and climate events, the productivity of low-diversity communities with one or two species changed by approximately 50% during climate events, whereas that of high-diversity communities with 16-32 species was more resistant, changing by only approximately 25%. By a year after each climate event, ecosystem productivity had often fully recovered, or overshot, normal levels of productivity in both high-and low-diversity communities, leading to no detectable dependence of ecosystem resilience on biodiversity. Our results suggest that biodiversity mainly stabilizes ecosystem productivity, and productivity-dependent ecosystem services, by increasing resistance to climate events. Anthropogenic environmental changes that drive biodiversity loss thus seem likely to decrease ecosystem stability(14), and restoration of biodiversity to increase it, mainly by changing the resistance of ecosystem productivity to climate events.","Isbell, Forest; Craven, Dylan; Connolly, John; Loreau, Michel; Schmid, Bernhard; Beierkuhnlein, Carl; Bezemer, T.

75,17,470.0,"A central hub of carbon metabolism is the tricarboxylic acid cycle 1, which serves to connect the processes of glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, respiration, amino acid synthesis and other biosynthetic pathways. The protozoan intracellular malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.), however, have long been suspected of possessing a significantly streamlined carbon metabolic network in which tricarboxylic acid metabolism plays a minor role(2). Blood-stage Plasmodium parasites rely almost entirely on glucose fermentation for energy and consume minimal amounts of oxygen(3), yet the parasite genome encodes all of the enzymes necessary for a complete tricarboxylic acid cycle(4). Here, by tracing (13)C-labelled compounds using mass spectrometry(5), we show that tricarboxylic acid metabolism in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum is largely disconnected from glycolysis and is organized along a fundamentally different architecture from the canonical textbook pathway. We find that this pathway is not cyclic, but rather is a branched structure in which the major carbon sources are the amino acids glutamate and glutamine. As a consequence of this branched architecture, several reactions must run in the reverse of the standard direction, thereby generating two-carbon units in the form of acetyl-coenzyme A. We further show that glutamine-derived acetyl-coenzyme A is used for histone acetylation, whereas glucose-derived acetyl-coenzyme A is used to acetylate amino sugars. Thus, the parasite has evolved two independent production mechanisms for acetyl-coenzyme A with different biological functions. These results significantly clarify our understanding of the Plasmodium metabolic network and highlight the ability of altered variants of central carbon metabolism to arise in response to unique environments.","Olszewski, Kellen L.; Mather, Michael W.; Morrisey, Joanne M.; Garcia, Benjamin A.; Vaidya, Akhil B.; Rabinowitz, Joshua D.; Llinas, Manuel","Olszewski, KL; Mather, MW; Morrisey, JM; Garcia, BA; Vaidya, AB; Rabinowitz, JD; Llinas, M",774.0,"[Olszewski, Kellen L.; Llinas, Manuel] Princeton Univ, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Olszewski, Kellen L.; Rabinowitz, Joshua D.; Llinas, Manuel] Princeton Univ, Lewis Sigler Inst Integrat Gen, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Mather, Michael W.; Morrisey, Joanne M.; Vaidya, Akhil B.] Drexel Univ, Coll Med, Ctr Mol Parasitol, Philadelphia, PA 19129 USA; [Garcia, Benjamin A.] Princeton Univ, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Rabinowitz, Joshua D.] Princeton Univ, Dept Chem, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09301,Article,,manuel@genomics.princeton.edu,U16,"Burroughs Wellcome Fund; NIH [1DP2OD001315-01, R01 AI078063]; Beckman Young Investigators award; NSF [CBET-0941143]; Center for Quantitative Biology [P50 GM071508]; NIAID, NIH [AI028398]","We thank G.

76,150,224.0,"The El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the Earth's most prominent source of interannual climate variability, exerting profound worldwide effects(1-7). Despite decades of research, its behaviour continues to challenge scientists. In the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean, the anomalously cool sea surface temperatures (SSTs) found during La Nina events and the warm waters of modest El Nino events both propagate westwards, as in the seasonal cycle(7). In contrast, SST anomalies propagate eastwards during extreme El Nino events, prominently in the post-1976 period(7-10), spurring unusual weather events worldwide with costly consequences(3-6,11). The cause of this propagation asymmetry is currently unknown(10). Here we trace the cause of the asymmetry to the variations in upper ocean currents in the equatorial Pacific, whereby the westward-flowing currents are enhanced during La Nina events but reversed during extreme El Nino events. Our results highlight that propagation asymmetry is favoured when the westward mean equatorial currents weaken, as is projected to be the case under global warming(12-14). By analysing past and future climate simulations of an ensemble of models with more realistic propagation, we find a doubling in the occurrences of El Nino events that feature prominent eastward propagation characteristics in a warmer world. Our analysis thus suggests that more frequent emergence of propagation asymmetry will be an indication of the Earth's warming climate.","Santoso, Agus; McGregor, Shayne; Jin, Fei-Fei; Cai, Wenju; England, Matthew H.; An, Soon-Il; McPhaden, Michael J.; Guilyardi, Eric","Santoso, A; McGregor, S; Jin, FF; Cai, WJ; England, MH; An, SI; McPhaden, MJ; Guilyardi, E",126.0,"[Santoso, Agus; McGregor, Shayne; England, Matthew H.] Univ New S Wales, Australian Res Council ARC Ctr Excellence Climate, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Santoso, Agus; McGregor, Shayne; England, Matthew H.] Univ New S Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Jin, Fei-Fei] Univ Hawaii Manoa, SOEST, Dept Meteorol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Cai, Wenju] CSIRO, Marine & Atmospher Res, Aspendale, Vic 3195, Australia; [An, Soon-Il] Yonsei Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Seoul 120749, South Korea; [McPhaden, Michael J.] NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Guilyardi, Eric] Univ Paris 06, CNRS, IPSL, Lab Oceanog & Climat Experimentat & Approches Num, F-75252 Paris 05, France; [Guilyardi, Eric] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci NCAS Climate, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12683,Article,1476-4687,a.santoso@unsw.edu.au,+,Australian Research Council; Australian Climate Change Science Programme; National Research Foundation of Korea; Korean government (MEST) [NRF-2009-C1AAA001-2009-0093042]; NOAA,"We acknowledge the World Climate Research Programme's Working Group on Coupled Modelling and all modelling groups for making the CMIP data available.

77,153,323.0,"The El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) drives substantial variability in rainfall(1-3), severe weather(4,5), agricultural production(3,6), ecosystems(7) and disease(8) in many parts of the world. Given that further human-forced changes in the Earth's climate system seem inevitable(9,10), the possibility exists that the character of ENSO and its impacts might change over the coming century. Although this issue has been investigated many times during the past 20 years, there is very little consensus on future changes in ENSO, apart from an expectation that ENSO will continue to be a dominant source of year-to-year variability(9,11,12). Here we show that there are in fact robust projected changes in the spatial patterns of year-to-year ENSO-driven variability in both surface temperature and precipitation. These changes are evident in the two most recent generations of climate models(13,14), using four different scenarios for CO2 and other radiatively active gases(14-17). By the mid- to late twenty-first century, the projections include an intensification of both El-Nino-driven drying in the western Pacific Ocean and rainfall increases in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific. Experiments with an Atmospheric General Circulation Model reveal that robust projected changes in precipitation anomalies during El Nino years are primarily determined by a nonlinear response to surface global warming. Uncertain projected changes in the amplitude of ENSO-driven surface temperature variability have only a secondary role. Projected changes in key characteristics of ENSO are consequently much clearer than previously realized.","Power, Scott; Delage, Francois; Chung, Christine; Kociuba, Greg; Keay, Kevin","Power, S; Delage, F; Chung, C; Kociuba, G; Keay, K",541.0,"[Power, Scott; Delage, Francois; Chung, Christine; Kociuba, Greg; Keay, Kevin] Bur Meteorol, Ctr Australian Weather & Climate Res, Melbourne, Vic 3008, Australia",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12580,Article,1476-4687,s.power@bom.gov.au,+,"Australian Climate Change Science Program (ACCSP); Pacific-Australia Climate Change Science and Adaptation planning Program (PACCSAP); AusAID; Department of Industry, Innovation, Climate Change, Science, Research and Tertiary Education","We thank L.

78,194,316.0,"Cancer genome sequencing provides the first direct information on how mutation rates vary across the human genome in somatic cells(1-7). Testing diverse genetic and epigenetic features, here we show that mutation rates in cancer genomes are strikingly related to chromatin organization. Indeed, at the megabase scale, a single feature-levels of the heterochromatin-associated histone modification H3K9me3-can account for more than 40% of mutation-rate variation, and a combination of features can account for more than 55%. The strong association between mutation rates and chromatin organization is upheld in samples from different tissues and for different mutation types. This suggests that the arrangement of the genome into heterochromatin- and euchromatin-like domains is a dominant influence on regional mutation-rate variation in human somatic cells.","Schuster-Boeckler, Benjamin; Lehner, Ben","Schuster-Bockler, B; Lehner, B",504.0,"[Schuster-Boeckler, Benjamin; Lehner, Ben] CRG, EMBL CRG Syst Biol Unit, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Schuster-Boeckler, Benjamin; Lehner, Ben] UPF, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Schuster-Boeckler, Benjamin] Pear Comp LLP, London W5 1SH, England; [Lehner, Ben] Passeig Lluis Co 23, ICREA, Barcelona 08010, Spain",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11273,Article,1476-4687,ben.lehner@crg.es,+,"European Research Council (ERC); European Union [277899 4DCellFate]; ERASysBioPLUS; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion (MICINN) [BFU2008-00365, BFU2011-26206]; Agencia de Gestio d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca (AGAUR); European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO); EMBL-CRG Systems Biology Program; Juan de la Cierva postdoctoral fellowship; ICREA","This work was funded by an European Research Council (ERC) Starting Grant, European Union Framework 7 project 277899 4DCellFate, ERASysBioPLUS, Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion (MICINN) grants BFU2008-00365 and BFU2011-26206, Agencia de Gestio d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca (AGAUR), the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) Young Investigator Program, the EMBL-CRG Systems Biology Program and a Juan de la Cierva postdoctoral fellowship to B.S-B.

79,44,336.0,"AB(5) toxins comprise an A subunit that corrupts essential eukaryotic cell functions, and pentameric B subunits that direct targetcell uptake after binding surface glycans. Subtilase cytotoxin (SubAB) is an AB5 toxin secreted by Shiga toxigenic Escherichia coli (STEC)(1), which causes serious gastrointestinal disease in humans(2). SubAB causes haemolytic uraemic syndrome- like pathology in mice(3) through SubA- mediated cleavage of BiP/GRP78, an essential endoplasmic reticulum chaperone(4). Here we show that SubB has a strong preference for glycans terminating in the sialic acid N- glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), a monosaccharide not synthesized in humans. Structures of SubB - Neu5Gc complexes revealed the basis for this specificity, and mutagenesis of key SubB residues abrogated in vitro glycan recognition, cell binding and cytotoxicity. SubAB specificity for Neu5Gc was confirmed using mouse tissues with a human- like deficiency of Neu5Gc and human cell lines fed with Neu5Gc. Despite lack of Neu5Gc biosynthesis in humans, assimilation of dietary Neu5Gc creates high- affinity receptors on human gut epithelia and kidney vasculature. This, and the lack of Neu5Gc- containing body fluid competitors in humans, confers susceptibility to the gastrointestinal and systemic toxicities of SubAB. Ironically, foods rich in Neu5Gc are the most common source of STEC contamination. Thus a bacterial toxin's receptor is generated by metabolic incorporation of an exogenous factor derived from food.","Byres, Emma; Paton, Adrienne W.; Paton, James C.; Lofling, Jonas C.; Smith, David F.; Wilce, Matthew C.

80,139,484.0,"Modern observations of the geomagnetic field reveal fluctuations(1-3) with a dominant period of about 60 years. These fluctuations are probably a result of waves in the liquid core(4), although the precise nature of the waves is uncertain. Common suggestions include a type of magnetic wave, known as a torsional oscillation(5), but recent studies(6) favour periods that are too short to account for a 60-year fluctuation. Another possibility involves MAC waves(7), which arise from the interplay between magnetic, Archimedes and Coriolis forces. Waves with a suitable period can emerge when the top of the core is stably stratified. Here I show that MAC waves provide a good description of time-dependent zonal flow at the top of the core(8), as inferred from geomagnetic secular variation(9). The same wave motion can also account for unexplained fluctuations in the dipole field(10). Both of these independent predictions require a 140-kilometre-thick stratified layer with a buoyancy frequency comparable to the Earth's rotation rate. Such a stratified layer could have a thermal origin(11,12), implying a core heat flow of about 13 terawatts. Alternatively, the layer could result from chemical stratification(13,14). In either case, the existence of a stratified layer at the top of the core obscures the nature of flow deeper in the core, where the magnetic field is continually regenerated.","Buffett, Bruce","Buffett, B",484.0,"Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13122,Article,1476-4687,bbuffett@berkeley.edu,+,US National Science Foundation [EAR-1045277],A.

81,98,192.0,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaques, which are predominantly composed of amyloid-beta peptide(1). Two principal physiological pathways either prevent or promote amyloid-beta generation from its precursor, beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP), in a competitive manne(r)1. Although APP processing has been studied in great detail, unknown proteolytic events seem to hinder stoichiometric analyses of APP metabolism in vivo(2). Here we describe a new physiological APP processing pathway, which generates proteolytic fragments capable of inhibiting neuronal activity within the hippocampus. We identify higher molecular mass carboxy-terminal fragments (CTFs) of APP, termed CTF-eta, in addition to the long-known CTF-alpha and CTF-beta fragments generated by the alpha- and beta-secretases ADAM10 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10) and BACE1 (beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1), respectively. CTF-eta generation is mediated in part by membrane-bound matrix metalloproteinases such as MT5-MMP, referred to as g-secretase activity. g-Secretase cleavage occurs primarily at amino acids 504-505 of APP(695), releasing a truncated ectodomain. After shedding of this ectodomain, CTF-eta is further processed by ADAM10 and BACE1 to release long and short A eta peptides (termed A eta-alpha and A eta-beta). CTFs produced by g-secretase are enriched in dystrophic neurites in an AD mouse model and in human AD brains. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of BACE1 activity results in robust accumulation of CTF-eta and A eta-alpha. In mice treated with a potent BACE1 inhibitor, hippocampal long-term potentiation was reduced. Notably, when recombinant or synthetic A eta-alpha was applied on hippocampal slices ex vivo, long-term potentiation was lowered. Furthermore, in vivo single-cell two-photon calcium imaging showed that hippocampal neuronal activity was attenuated by A eta-alpha. These findings not only demonstrate a major functionally relevant APP processing pathway, but may also indicate potential translational relevance for therapeutic strategies targeting APP processing.","Willem, Michael; Tahirovic, Sabina; Busche, Marc Aurel; Ovsepian, Saak V.; Chafai, Magda; Kootar, Scherazad; Hornburg, Daniel; Evans, Lewis D.

82,143,35.0,"Intermittent intense ultraviolet (UV) exposure represents an important aetiological factor in the development of malignant melanoma(1). The ability of UV radiation to cause tumour-initiating DNA mutations in melanocytes is now firmly established(2), but how the microenvironmental effects of UV radiation(3,4) influence melanoma pathogenesis is not fully understood. Here we report that repetitive UV exposure of primary cutaneous melanomas in a genetically engineered mouse model(5) promotes metastatic progression, independent of its tumour-initiating effects. UV irradiation enhanced the expansion of tumour cells along abluminal blood vessel surfaces and increased the number of lung metastases. This effect depended on the recruitment and activation of neutrophils, initiated by the release of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) from UV-damaged epidermal keratinocytes and driven by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). The UV-induced neutrophilic inflammatory response stimulated angiogenesis and promoted the ability of melanoma cells to migrate towards endothelial cells and use selective motility cues on their surfaces. Our results not only reveal how UV irradiation of epidermal keratinocytes is sensed by the innate immune system, but also show that the resulting inflammatory response catalyses reciprocal melanoma-endothelial cell interactions leading to perivascular invasion, a phenomenon originally described as angiotropism in human melanomas by histopathologists(6). Angiotropism represents a hitherto underappreciated mechanism of metastasis(7) that also increases the likelihood of intravasation and haematogenous dissemination. Consistent with our findings, ulcerated primary human melanomas with abundant neutrophils and reactive angiogenesis frequently show angiotropism and a high risk for metastases. Our work indicates that targeting the inflammation-induced phenotypic plasticity of melanoma cells and their association with endothelial cells represent rational strategies to specifically interfere with metastatic progression.","Bald, Tobias; Quast, Thomas; Landsberg, Jennifer; Rogava, Meri; Glodde, Nicole; Lopez-Ramos, Dorys; Kohlmeyer, Judith; Riesenberg, Stefanie; van den Boorn-Konijnenberg, Debby; Hoemig-Hoelzel, Cornelia; Reuten, Raphael; Schadow, Benjamin; Weighardt, Heike; Wenzel, Daniela; Helfrich, Iris; Schadendorf, Dirk; Bloch, Wilhelm; Bianchi, Marco E.; Lugassy, Claire; Barnhill, Raymond L.; Koch, Manuel; Fleischmann, Bernd K.; Foerster, Irmgard; Kastenmueller, Wolfgang; Kolanus, Waldemar; Hoelzel, Michael; Gaffal, Evelyn; Tueting, Thomas","Bald, T; Quast, T; Landsberg, J; Rogava, M; Glodde, N; Lopez-Ramos, D; Kohlmeyer, J; Riesenberg, S; van den Boorn-Konijnenberg, D; Homig-Holzel, C; Reuten, R; Schadow, B; Weighardt, H; Wenzel, D; Helfrich, I; Schadendorf, D; Bloch, W; Bianchi, ME; Lugassy, C; Barnhill, RL; Koch, M; Fleischmann, BK; Forster, I; Kastenmuller, W; Kolanus, W; Holzel, M; Gaffal, E; Tuting, T",109.0,"[Bald, Tobias; Landsberg, Jennifer; Rogava, Meri; Glodde, Nicole; Lopez-Ramos, Dorys; Kohlmeyer, Judith; Gaffal, Evelyn; Tueting, Thomas] Univ Bonn, Dept Dermatol & Allergy, Lab Expt Dermatol, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Quast, Thomas; Schadow, Benjamin; Weighardt, Heike; Foerster, Irmgard; Kolanus, Waldemar] Univ Bonn, Life & Med Sci Inst, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Riesenberg, Stefanie; van den Boorn-Konijnenberg, Debby; Hoemig-Hoelzel, Cornelia; Hoelzel, Michael] Univ Bonn, Dept Clin Chem & Clin Pharmacol, Unit RNA Biol, D-53105 Bonn, Germany; [Reuten, Raphael; Koch, Manuel] Univ Cologne, Inst Dent Res & Oral Musculoskeletal Biol, Fac Med, Ctr Biochem, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; [Wenzel, Daniela; Fleischmann, Bernd K.] Univ Bonn, Life & Brain Ctr, Inst Physiol 1, D-53105 Bonn, Germany; [Helfrich, Iris; Schadendorf, Dirk] Univ Hosp Essen, Dept Dermatol, D-45122 Essen, Germany; [Bloch, Wilhelm] German Sport Univ Cologne, Inst Cardiovasc Res & Sport Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Sport Med, D-50933 Cologne, Germany; [Bianchi, Marco E.] San Raffaele Univ & Sci Inst, Div Genet & Cell Biol, I-20132 Milan, Italy; [Lugassy, Claire; Barnhill, Raymond L.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Med Ctr, Jonsson Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Kastenmueller, Wolfgang] Univ Bonn, Inst Mol Med & Expt Immunol, D-53105 Bonn, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13111,Article,1476-4687,michael.hoelzel@ukb.uni-bonn.de; evelyn.gaffal@ukb.uni-bonn.de; thomas.tueting@ukb.uni-bonn.de,+,"Deutsche Krebshilfe P9 in the Melanoma Research Network; DFG [SFB832, SFB704, HO 4281/2-1, SFB829, SFB829 Z2]; BONFOR; NRW junior research group; Jurgen Manchot Stiftung; AIRC","We would like to thank the following individuals for their support: G.

83,76,497.0,"Extant jawed vertebrates, or gnathostomes, fall into two major monophyletic groups, namely chondrichthyans (cartilaginous fishes) and osteichthyans (bony fishes and tetrapods). Fossil representatives of the osteichthyan crown group are known from the latest Silurian period, 418 million years (Myr) ago, to the present. By contrast, stem chondrichthyans and stem osteichthyans are still largely unknown. Two extinct Palaeozoic groups, the acanthodians and placoderms, may fall into these stem groups or the common stem group of gnathostomes, but their relationships and monophyletic status are both debated. Here we report unambiguous evidence for osteichthyan characters in jaw bones referred to the late Silurian (423-416-Myr-old) fishes Andreolepis hedei and Lophosteus superbus, long known from isolated bone fragments, scales and teeth, and whose affinities to, or within, osteichthyans have been debated(1-11). The bones are a characteristic osteichthyan maxillary and dentary, but the organization of the tooth-like denticles they bear differs from the large, conical teeth of crown-group osteichthyans, indicating that they can be assigned to the stem group. Andreolepis and Lophosteus are thus not only the oldest but also the most phylogenetically basal securely identified osteichthyans known so far.","Botella, Hector; Blom, Henning; Dorka, Markus; Ahlberg, Per Erik; Janvier, Philippe","Botella, H; Blom, H; Dorka, M; Ahlberg, PE; Janvier, P",583.0,"Museum Natl Hist Nat, CNRS, Dept Hist Terre, UMR 5143, F-75231 Paris 05, France; Nat Hist Museum, Dept Palaeontol, London SW7 5BD, England; Univ Valencia, Dept Geol, E-46100 Valencia, Spain; Uppsala Univ, Dept Physiol & Dev Biol, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden; Humboldt Univ, Museum Naturkunde, D-10115 Berlin, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature05989,Article,,janvier@mnhn.fr,586,,,195XV,,,LOPHOSTEUS-SUPERBUS PANDER; DENTITIONS; ORIGIN; SCALES,7153.0,NATURE,Nature,English,28.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2-Aug,4.0,LONDON,17671501.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007.0,"Ahlberg, Per/E-8086-2013","Janvier, P (reprint author), Museum Natl Hist Nat, CNRS, Dept Hist Terre, UMR 5143, 47 Rue Cuvier, F-75231 Paris 05, France.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,49.0,Jaws and teeth of the earliest bony fishes,3.0,26.0,WOS:000248446700041,497.0,448,Multidisciplinary Sciences,53,philippe,janvier,7305.0,605,male,0.99,aIygpCcAAAAJ,3,"(4126, 9345]",21279624,1,21279624,1,Philippe Janvier,Philippe Janvier,1,1
84,43,268.0,"The ability to manipulate nanoscopic matter precisely is critical for the development of active nanosystems. Optical tweezers(1-4) are excellent tools for transporting particles ranging in size fromseveral micrometres to a few hundred nanometres. Manipulation of dielectric objects with much smaller diameters, however, requires stronger optical confinement and higher intensities than can be provided by these diffraction- limited(5) systems. Here we present an approach to optofluidic transport that overcomes these limitations, using sub-wavelength liquid- core slot waveguides(6). The technique simultaneously makes use of near- field optical forces to confine matter inside the waveguide and scattering/ adsorption forces to transport it. The ability of the slot waveguide to condense the accessible electromagnetic energy to scales as small as 60 nm allows us also to overcome the fundamental diffraction problem. We apply the approach here to the trapping and transport of 75- nm dielectric nanoparticles and lambda-DNA molecules. Because trapping occurs along a line, rather than at a point as with traditional point traps(7,8), the method provides the ability to handle extended biomolecules directly. We also carry out a detailed numerical analysis that relates the near- field optical forces to release kinetics. We believe that the architecture demonstrated here will help to bridge the gap between optical manipulation and nanofluidics.","Yang, Allen H.

85,160,466.0,"Surface gravity is a basic stellar property, but it is difficult to measure accurately, with typical uncertainties of 25 to 50 per cent if measured spectroscopically(1,2) and 90 to 150 per cent if measured photometrically(3). Asteroseismology measures gravity with an uncertainty of about 2 per cent but is restricted to relatively small samples of bright stars, most of which are giants(4-6). The availability of high-precision measurements of brightness variations for more than 150,000 stars(7,8) provides an opportunity to investigate whether the variations can be used to determine surface gravities. The Fourier power of granulation on a star's surface correlates physically with surface gravity(9,10): if brightness variations on timescales of hours arise from granulation(11), then such variations should correlate with surface gravity. Here we report an analysis of archival data that reveals an observational correlation between surface gravity and root mean squared brightness variations on timescales of less than eight hours for stars with temperatures of 4,500 to 6,750 kelvin, log surface gravities of 2.5 to 4.5 (cgs units) and overall brightness variations of less than three parts per thousand. A straightforward observation of optical brightness variations therefore allows a determination of the surface gravity with a precision of better than 25 per cent for inactive Sun-like stars at main-sequence to giant stages of evolution.","Bastien, Fabienne A.; Stassun, Keivan G.; Basri, Gibor; Pepper, Joshua","Bastien, FA; Stassun, KG; Basri, G; Pepper, J",427.0,"[Bastien, Fabienne A.; Stassun, Keivan G.; Pepper, Joshua] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Stassun, Keivan G.] Fisk Univ, Dept Phys, Nashville, TN 37208 USA; [Basri, Gibor] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Astron, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Pepper, Joshua] Lehigh Univ, Dept Phys, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12419,Article,1476-4687,fabienne.a.bastien@vanderbilt.edu,430,NASA; Vanderbilt Provost Graduate Fellowship; NSF PAARE [AST-0849736],"The research described in this paper makes use of Filtergraph (http://filtergraph.vanderbilt.edu), an online data visualization tool developed at Vanderbilt University through the Vanderbilt Initiative in Data-intensive Astrophysics.

86,199,0.0,"Protein synthesis involves the translation of ribonucleic acid information into proteins, the building blocks of life. The initial step of protein synthesis is the binding of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) to the 7-methylguanosine (m(7)-GpppG) 5' cap of messenger RNAs1,2. Low oxygen tension (hypoxia) represses cap-mediated translation by sequestering eIF4E through mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)dependent mechanisms(3-6). Although the internal ribosome entry site is an alternative translation initiation mechanism, this pathway alone cannot account for the translational capacity of hypoxic cells(7,8). This raises a fundamental question in biology as to how proteins are synthesized in periods of oxygen scarcity and eIF4E inhibition(9). Here we describe an oxygen-regulated translation initiation complex that mediates selective cap-dependent protein synthesis. We show that hypoxia stimulates the formation of a complex that includes the oxygen-regulated hypoxia-inducible factor 2 alpha (HIF-2 alpha), the RNA-binding protein RBM4 and the cap-binding eIF4E2, an eIF4E homologue. Photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP)(10) analysis identified an RNA hypoxia response element (rHRE) that recruits this complex to a wide array of mRNAs, including that encoding the epidermal growth factor receptor. Once assembled at the rHRE, the HIF-2 alpha-RBM4-eIF4E2 complex captures the 5' cap and targets mRNAs to polysomes for active translation, thereby evading hypoxia-induced repression of protein synthesis. These findings demonstrate that cells have evolved a program by which oxygen tension switches the basic translation initiation machinery.","Uniacke, James; Holterman, Chet E.; Lachance, Gabriel; Franovic, Aleksandra; Jacob, Mathieu D.; Fabian, Marc R.; Payette, Josianne; Holcik, Martin; Pause, Arnim; Lee, Stephen","Uniacke, J; Holterman, CE; Lachance, G; Franovic, A; Jacob, MD; Fabian, MR; Payette, J; Holcik, M; Pause, A; Lee, S",126.0,"[Uniacke, James; Holterman, Chet E.; Lachance, Gabriel; Franovic, Aleksandra; Jacob, Mathieu D.; Payette, Josianne; Lee, Stephen] Univ Ottawa, Fac Med, Dept Cellular & Mol Med, Ottawa, ON K1H 8M5, Canada; [Fabian, Marc R.; Pause, Arnim] McGill Univ, Dept Biochem, Goodman Canc Res Ctr, Montreal, PQ H3G 1Y6, Canada; [Holcik, Martin] Childrens Hosp Eastern Ontario, Res Inst, Apoptosis Res Ctr, Ottawa, ON K1H 8L1, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11055,Article,,slee@uottawa.ca,U154,Canadian Institutes of Health Research; Terry Fox Foundation (Canadian Cancer Society) [700014]; Terry Fox Foundation; Canadian Cancer Society,"We thank J.

Frozen-in field lines, however, preclude the rapid changes in magnetic topology observed at high conductivities, as in solar flares(2,3). Microphysical plasma processes are a proposed explanation of the observed high rates(4-6), but it is an open question whether such processes can rapidly reconnect astrophysical flux structures much greater in extent than several thousand ion gyroradii. An alternative explanation(7,8) is that turbulent Richardson advection(9) brings field lines implosively together from distances far apart to separations of the order of gyroradii. Here we report an analysis of a simulation of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence at high conductivity that exhibits Richardson dispersion. This effect of advection in rough velocity fields, which appear non-differentiable in space, leads to line motions that are completely indeterministic or 'spontaneously stochastic', as predicted in analytical studies(10-13). The turbulent breakdown of standard flux freezing at scales greater than the ion gyroradius can explain fast reconnection of very large-scale flux structures, both observed (solar flares and coronal mass ejections) and predicted (the inner heliosheath, accretion disks, gamma-ray bursts and so on). For laminar plasma flows with smooth velocity fields or for low turbulence intensity, stochastic flux freezing reduces to the usual frozen-in condition.

88,113,428.0,"Sex determination in animals is amazingly plastic. Vertebrates display contrasting strategies ranging from complete genetic control of sex (genotypic sex determination) to environmentally determined sex (for example, temperature-dependent sex determination)(1). Phylogenetic analyses suggest frequent evolutionary transitions between genotypic and temperature-dependent sex determination in environmentally sensitive lineages, including reptiles(2). These transitions are thought to involve a genotypic system becoming sensitive to temperature, with sex determined by gene-environment interactions(3). Most mechanistic models of transitions invoke a role for sex reversal(3-5). Sex reversal has not yet been demonstrated in nature for any amniote, although it occurs in fish(6) and rarely in amphibians(7,8). Here we make the first report of reptile sex reversal in the wild, in the Australian bearded dragon (Pogona vitticeps), and use sex-reversed animals to experimentally induce a rapid transition from genotypic to temperature-dependent sex determination. Controlled mating of normal males to sex-reversed females produces viable and fertile offspring whose phenotypic sex is determined solely by temperature (temperature-dependent sex determination). The W sex chromosome is eliminated from this lineage in the first generation. The instantaneous creation of a lineage of ZZ temperature-sensitive animals reveals a novel, climate-induced pathway for the rapid transition between genetic and temperature-dependent sex determination, and adds to concern about adaptation to rapid global climate change.","Holleley, Clare E.; O'Meally, Denis; Sarre, Stephen D.; Graves, Jennifer A.

89,207,173.0,"The Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction approximately 66 million years ago is conventionally thought to have been a turning point in mammalian evolution(1,2). Prior to that event and for the first two-thirds of their evolutionary history, mammals were mostly confined to roles as generalized, small-bodied, nocturnal insectivores(3), presumably under selection pressures from dinosaurs(4). Release from these pressures, by extinction of non-avian dinosaurs at the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary, triggered ecological diversification of mammals(1,2). Although recent individual fossil discoveries have shown that some mammalian lineages diversified ecologically during the Mesozoic era(5), comprehensive ecological analyses of mammalian groups crossing the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary are lacking. Such analyses are needed because diversification analyses of living taxa(6,7) allow only indirect inferences of past ecosystems. Here we show that in arguably the most evolutionarily successful clade of Mesozoic mammals, the Multituberculata, an adaptive radiation began at least 20 million years before the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs and continued across the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary. Disparity in dental complexity, which relates to the range of diets, rose sharply in step with generic richness and disparity in body size. Moreover, maximum dental complexity and body size demonstrate an adaptive shift towards increased herbivory. This dietary expansion tracked the ecological rise of angiosperms(8) and suggests that the resources that were available to multituberculates were relatively unaffected by the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction. Taken together, our results indicate that mammals were able to take advantage of new ecological opportunities in the Mesozoic and that at least some of these opportunities persisted through the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction. Similar broad-scale ecomorphological inventories of other radiations may help to constrain the possible causes of mass extinctions(9,10).","Wilson, Gregory P.; Evans, Alistair R.; Corfe, Ian J.; Smits, Peter D.; Fortelius, Mikael; Jernvall, Jukka","Wilson, GP; Evans, AR; Corfe, IJ; Smits, PD; Fortelius, M; Jernvall, J",457.0,"[Wilson, Gregory P.; Smits, Peter D.] Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Evans, Alistair R.; Smits, Peter D.] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Corfe, Ian J.; Fortelius, Mikael; Jernvall, Jukka] Univ Helsinki, Inst Biotechnol, Dev Biol Program, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Fortelius, Mikael] Univ Helsinki, Dept Geosci & Geog, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10880,Article,,gpwilson@u.washington.edu,460,National Science Foundation; Denver Museum; University of Washington; Australian Research Council; Monash University; Academy of Finland; EU SYNTHESYS [GB-TAF-4779],"We thank museums, institutions and individuals that made specimens available for this study (full list is available in Supplementary Information).

90,25,194.0,"Horizontal transfer (HT), or the passage of genetic material between non-mating species, is increasingly recognized as an important force in the evolution of eukaryotic genomes(1,2). Transposons, with their inherent ability to mobilize and amplify within genomes, may be especially prone to HT(3-7). However, the means by which transposons can spread across widely diverged species remain elusive. Here we present evidence that host-parasite interactions have promoted the HT of four transposon families between invertebrates and vertebrates. We found that Rhodnius prolixus, a triatomine bug feeding on the blood of various tetrapods and vector of Chagas' disease in humans, carries in its genome four distinct transposon families that also invaded the genomes of a diverse, but overlapping, set of tetrapods. The bug transposons are similar to 98% identical and cluster phylogenetically with those of the opossum and squirrel monkey, two of its preferred mammalian hosts in South America. We also identified one of these transposon families in the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis, a cosmopolitan vector of trematodes infecting diverse vertebrates, whose ancestral sequence is nearly identical and clusters with those found in Old World mammals. Together these data provide evidence for a previously hypothesized role of host-parasite interactions in facilitating HT among animals(3,7). Furthermore, the large amount of DNA generated by the amplification of the horizontally transferred transposons supports the idea that the exchange of genetic material between hosts and parasites influences their genomic evolution.","Gilbert, Clement; Schaack, Sarah; Pace, John K., II; Brindley, Paul J.; Feschotte, Cedric","Gilbert, C; Schaack, S; Pace, JK; Brindley, PJ; Feschotte, C",1347.0,"[Gilbert, Clement; Schaack, Sarah; Pace, John K., II; Feschotte, Cedric] Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Biol, Arlington, TX 76019 USA; [Brindley, Paul J.] George Washington Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Microbiol Immunol & Trop Med, Washington, DC 20037 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08939,Article,,cedric@uta.edu,U4,National Institutes of Health; National Science Foundation,"We thank E.

91,212,269.0,"The concept of disease-specific chemotherapy was developed a century ago. Dyes and arsenical compounds that displayed selectivity against trypanosomes were central to this work(1,2), and the drugs that emerged remain in use for treating human African trypanosomiasis (HAT)(3). The importance of understanding the mechanisms underlying selective drug action and resistance for the development of improved HAT therapies has been recognized, but these mechanisms have remained largely unknown. Here we use all five current HAT drugs for genome-scale RNA interference target sequencing (RIT-seq) screens in Trypanosoma brucei, revealing the transporters, organelles, enzymes and metabolic pathways that function to facilitate antitrypanosomal drug action. RIT-seq profiling identifies both known drug importers(4,5) and the only known prodrug activator(6), and links more than fifty additional genes to drug action. A bloodstream stage-specific invariant surface glycoprotein (ISG75) family mediates suramin uptake, and the AP1 adaptin complex, lysosomal proteases and major lysosomal transmembrane protein, as well as spermidine and N-acetylglucosamine biosynthesis, all contribute to suramin action. Further screens link ubiquinone availability to nitro-drug action, plasma membrane P-type H+-ATPases to pentamidine action, and trypanothione and several putative kinases to melarsoprol action. We also demonstrate a major role for aquaglyceroporins in pentamidine and melarsoprol cross-resistance. These advances in our understanding of mechanisms of antitrypanosomal drug efficacy and resistance will aid the rational design of new therapies and help to combat drug resistance, and provide unprecedented molecular insight into the mode of action of antitrypanosomal drugs.","Alsford, Sam; Eckert, Sabine; Baker, Nicola; Glover, Lucy; Sanchez-Flores, Alejandro; Leung, Ka Fai; Turner, Daniel J.; Field, Mark C.; Berriman, Matthew; Horn, David","Alsford, S; Eckert, S; Baker, N; Glover, L; Sanchez-Flores, A; Leung, KF; Turner, DJ; Field, MC; Berriman, M; Horn, D",232.0,"[Alsford, Sam; Baker, Nicola; Glover, Lucy; Horn, David] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London WC1E 7HT, England; [Eckert, Sabine; Sanchez-Flores, Alejandro; Turner, Daniel J.; Berriman, Matthew] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Cambridge CB10 1SA, England; [Leung, Ka Fai; Field, Mark C.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Pathol, Cambridge CB2 1QP, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10771,Article,1476-4687,david.horn@lshtm.ac.uk,U125,"Wellcome Trust [093010/Z/10/Z, 085775/Z/08/Z, 090007/Z/09/Z]; Bloomsbury colleges PhD studentship","We thank J.

92,79,197.0,"Antagonistic interactions between hosts and parasites are a key structuring force in natural populations, driving coevolution(1,2). However, direct empirical evidence of long-term host-parasite coevolution, in particular `Red Queen' dynamics-in which antagonistic biotic interactions such as host-parasite interactions can lead to reciprocal evolutionary dynamics-is rare(3-5), and current data, although consistent with theories of antagonistic coevolution, do not reveal the temporal dynamics of the process(6). Dormant stages of both the water flea Daphnia and its microparasites are conserved in lake sediments, providing an archive of past gene pools. Here we use this fact to reconstruct rapid coevolutionary dynamics in a natural setting and show that the parasite rapidly adapts to its host over a period of only a few years. A coevolutionary model based on negative frequency-dependent selection, and designed to mimic essential aspects of our host parasite system, corroborated these experimental results. In line with the idea of continuing host-parasite coevolution, temporal variation in parasite infectivity changed little over time. In contrast, from the moment the parasite was first found in the sediments, we observed a steady increase in virulence over time, associated with higher fitness of the parasite.","Decaestecker, Ellen; Gaba, Sabrina; Raeymaekers, Joost A.

94,166,48.0,"Aberrant neovascularization contributes to diseases such as cancer, blindness and atherosclerosis, and is the consequence of inappropriate angiogenic signalling. Although many regulators of pathogenic angiogenesis have been identified, our understanding of this process is incomplete. Here we explore the transcriptome of retinal microvessels isolated from mouse models of retinal disease that exhibit vascular pathology, and uncover an upregulated gene, leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein 1 (Lrg1), of previously unknown function. We show that in the presence of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), LRG1 is mitogenic to endothelial cells and promotes angiogenesis. Mice lacking Lrg1 develop a mild retinal vascular phenotype but exhibit a significant reduction in pathological ocular angiogenesis. LRG1 binds directly to the TGF-beta accessory receptor endoglin, which, in the presence of TGF-beta 1, results in promotion of the pro-angiogenic Smad1/5/8 signalling pathway. LRG1 antibody blockade inhibits this switch and attenuates angiogenesis. These studies reveal a new regulator of angiogenesis that mediates its effect by modulating TGF-beta signalling.","Wang, Xiaomeng; Abraham, Sabu; McKenzie, Jenny A.

95,149,264.0,"The appropriate timing of flowering is crucial for plant reproductive success. It is therefore not surprising that intricate genetic networks have evolved to perceive and integrate both endogenous and environmental signals, such as carbohydrate and hormonal status, photoperiod and temperature(1,2). In contrast to our detailed understanding of the vernalization pathway, little is known about how flowering time is controlled in response to changes in the ambient growth temperature. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the MADS-box transcription factor genes FLOWERING LOCUS M (FLM) and SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) have key roles in this process(3,4). FLM is subject to temperature-dependent alternative splicing(3). Here we report that the two main FLM protein splice variants, FLM-beta and FLM-delta, compete for interaction with the floral repressor SVP. The SVP-FLM-beta complex is predominately formed at low temperatures and prevents precocious flowering. By contrast, the competing SVP-FLM-delta complex is impaired in DNA binding and acts as a dominant-negative activator of flowering at higher temperatures. Our results show a new mechanism that controls the timing of the floral transition in response to changes in ambient temperature. A better understanding of how temperature controls the molecular mechanisms of flowering will be important to cope with current changes in global climate(5,6).","Pose, David; Verhage, Leonie; Ott, Felix; Yant, Levi; Mathieu, Johannes; Angenent, Gerco C.; Immink, Richard G.

96,172,208.0,"Whisking and sniffing are predominant aspects of exploratory behaviour in rodents. Yet the neural mechanisms that generate and coordinate these and other orofacial motor patterns remain largely uncharacterized. Here we use anatomical, behavioural, electrophysiological and pharmacological tools to show that whisking and sniffing are coordinated by respiratory centres in the ventral medulla. We delineate a distinct region in the ventral medulla that provides rhythmic input to the facial motor neurons that drive protraction of the vibrissae. Neuronal output from this region is reset at each inspiration by direct input from the pre-Botzinger complex, such that high-frequency sniffing has a one-to-one relationship with whisking, whereas basal respiration is accompanied by intervening whisks that occur between breaths. We conjecture that the respiratory nuclei, which project to other premotor regions for oral and facial control, function as a master clock for behaviours that coordinate with breathing.","Moore, Jeffrey D.; Deschenes, Martin; Furuta, Takahiro; Huber, Daniel; Smear, Matthew C.; Demers, Maxime; Kleinfeld, David","Moore, JD; Deschenes, M; Furuta, T; Huber, D; Smear, MC; Demers, M; Kleinfeld, D",205.0,"[Moore, Jeffrey D.; Kleinfeld, David] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Phys, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Deschenes, Martin; Demers, Maxime] Ctr Rech Univ Laval Robert Giffard, Dept Psychiat & Neurosci, Quebec City, PQ G1J 2G3, Canada; [Furuta, Takahiro] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Morphol Brain Sci, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Huber, Daniel; Smear, Matthew C.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA; [Kleinfeld, David] Univ Calif San Diego, Neurobiol Sect, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12076,Article,,martin.deschenes@crulrg.ulaval.ca; dk@physics.ucsd.edu,+,"Canadian Institutes of Health Research [MT-5877]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (KAKENHI) [23135519, 24500409]; National Institutes of Health [NS058668, NS066664, NS047101]; US-Israeli Binational Science Foundation [2003222]","We thank A.

97,110,24.0,"Magnetohydrodynamic turbulence is important in many high-energy astrophysical systems, where instabilities can amplify the local magnetic field over very short timescales(1,2). Specifically, the magnetorotational instability and dynamo action(3-6) have been suggested as a mechanism for the growth of magnetar-strength magnetic fields (of 10(15) gauss and above) and for powering the explosion(7-10) of a rotating massive star(11,12). Such stars are candidate progenitors of type Ic-bl hypernovae(13,14), which make up all supernovae that are connected to long gamma-ray bursts(15,16). The magnetorotational instability has been studied with local high-resolution shearing-box simulations in three dimensions(17-19), and with global two-dimensional simulations(20), but it is not known whether turbulence driven by this instability can result in the creation of a large-scale, ordered and dynamically relevant field. Here we report results from global, three-dimensional, general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic turbulence simulations. We show that hydromagnetic turbulence in rapidly rotating protoneutron stars produces an inverse cascade of energy. We find a large-scale, ordered toroidal field that is consistent with the formation of bipolar magnetorotationally driven outflows. Our results demonstrate that rapidly rotating massive stars are plausible progenitors for both type Ic-bl supernovae(13,21,22) and long gamma-ray bursts, and provide a viable mechanism for the formation of magnetars(23,24). Moreover, our findings suggest that rapidly rotating massive stars might lie behind potentially magnetar-powered superluminous supernovae(25,26).","Moesta, Philipp; Ott, Christian D.; Radice, David; Roberts, Luke F.; Schnetter, Erik; Haas, Roland","Mosta, P; Ott, CD; Radice, D; Roberts, LF; Schnetter, E; Haas, R",376.0,"[Moesta, Philipp; Ott, Christian D.; Radice, David; Roberts, Luke F.] CALTECH, Walter Burke Inst Theoret Phys, TAPIR, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Moesta, Philipp] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Astron, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Schnetter, Erik] Perimeter Inst Theoret Phys, Waterloo, ON N2L 2Y5, Canada; [Schnetter, Erik] Univ Guelph, Dept Phys, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Schnetter, Erik] Louisiana State Univ, Ctr Computat & Technol, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Haas, Roland] Max Planck Inst Gravitat Phys, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15755,Article,1476-4687,pmoesta@berkeley.edu,+,"National Science Foundation (NSF) [AST-1212170, PHY-1151197, OCI-0905046]; NASA [PF5-160140, PF3-140114]; National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Sherman Fairchild Foundation","We thank S.

98,4,91.0,"The reversible transfer of quantum states of light into and out of matter constitutes an important building block for future applications of quantum communication: it will allow the synchronization of quantum information(1), and the construction of quantum repeaters(2) and quantum networks(3). Much effort has been devoted to the development of such quantum memories(1), the key property of which is the preservation of entanglement during storage. Here we report the reversible transfer of photon-photon entanglement into entanglement between a photon and a collective atomic excitation in a solid-state device. Towards this end, we employ a thulium-doped lithium niobate waveguide in conjunction with a photon-echo quantum memory protocol(4), and increase the spectral acceptance from the current maximum(5) of 100 megahertz to 5 gigahertz. We assess the entanglement-preserving nature of our storage device through Bell inequality violations(6) and by comparing the amount of entanglement contained in the detected photon pairs before and after the reversible transfer. These measurements show, within statistical error, a perfect mapping process. Our broadband quantum memory complements the family of robust, integrated lithium niobate devices(7). It simplifies frequency-matching of light with matter interfaces in advanced applications of quantum communication, bringing fully quantum-enabled networks a step closer.","Saglamyurek, Erhan; Sinclair, Neil; Jin, Jeongwan; Slater, Joshua A.; Oblak, Daniel; Bussieres, Felix; George, Mathew; Ricken, Raimund; Sohler, Wolfgang; Tittel, Wolfgang","Saglamyurek, E; Sinclair, N; Jin, J; Slater, JA; Oblak, D; Bussieres, F; George, M; Ricken, R; Sohler, W; Tittel, W",512.0,"[Saglamyurek, Erhan; Sinclair, Neil; Jin, Jeongwan; Slater, Joshua A.; Oblak, Daniel; Bussieres, Felix; Tittel, Wolfgang] Univ Calgary, Inst Quantum Informat Sci, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [Saglamyurek, Erhan; Sinclair, Neil; Jin, Jeongwan; Slater, Joshua A.; Oblak, Daniel; Bussieres, Felix; Tittel, Wolfgang] Univ Calgary, Dept Phys & Astron, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [George, Mathew; Ricken, Raimund; Sohler, Wolfgang] Univ Paderborn, Dept Phys Appl Phys, D-33095 Paderborn, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09719,Article,,wtittel@ucalgary.ca,515,NSERC; QuantumWorks; General Dynamics Canada; iCORE (now part of Alberta Innovates); CFI; AAET; FQRNT,"This work is supported by NSERC, QuantumWorks, General Dynamics Canada, iCORE (now part of Alberta Innovates), CFI, AAET and FQRNT.

99,222,309.0,"Cryptic variation is caused by the robustness of phenotypes to mutations(1). Cryptic variation has no effect on phenotypes in a given genetic or environmental background, but it can have effects after mutations or environmental change(2-5). Because evolutionary adaptation by natural selection requires phenotypic variation, phenotypically revealed cryptic genetic variation may facilitate evolutionary adaptation(6-8). This is possible if the cryptic variation happens to be pre-adapted, or ""exapted""(9), to a new environment, and is thus advantageous once revealed. However, this facilitating role for cryptic variation has not been proven, partly because most pertinent work focuses on complex phenotypes of whole organisms whose genetic basis is incompletely understood. Here we show that populations of RNA enzymes with accumulated cryptic variation adapt more rapidly to a new substrate than a population without cryptic variation. A detailed analysis of our evolving RNA populations in genotype space shows that cryptic variation allows a population to explore new genotypes that become adaptive only in a new environment. Our observations show that cryptic variation contains new genotypes pre-adapted to a changed environment. Our results highlight the positive role that robustness and epistasis can have in adaptive evolution(10,11).","Hayden, Eric J.; Ferrada, Evandro; Wagner, Andreas","Hayden, EJ; Ferrada, E; Wagner, A",92.0,"[Hayden, Eric J.; Ferrada, Evandro; Wagner, Andreas] Univ Zurich, Inst Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Hayden, Eric J.; Ferrada, Evandro; Wagner, Andreas] Swiss Inst Bioinformat, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Wagner, Andreas] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10083,Article,,andreas.wagner@ieu.uzh.ch,U120,"Swiss National Science Foundation [315200-116814, 315200-119697, 315230-129708]; SystemsX.ch; University of Zurich","We thank R.

Phylogenomic analysis of 1,070 orthologues from 23 yeast genomes identified 1,070 distinct gene trees, which were all incongruent with the phylogeny inferred from concatenation. Incongruence severity increased for shorter internodes located deeper in the phylogeny. Notably, whereas most practices had little or negative impact on the yeast phylogeny, the use of genes or internodes with high average internode support significantly improved the robustness of inference. We obtained similar results in analyses of vertebrate and metazoan phylogenomic data sets.

101,122,95.0,"We sequenced the genomes of a similar to 7,000-year-old farmer from Germany and eight similar to 8,000-year-old hunter-gatherers from Luxembourg and Sweden. We analysed these and other ancient genomes(1-4) with 2,345 contemporary humans to show that most present-day Europeans derive from at least three highly differentiated populations: west European hunter-gatherers, who contributed ancestry to all Europeans but not to Near Easterners; ancient north Eurasians related to Upper Palaeolithic Siberians(3), who contributed to both Europeans and Near Easterners; and early European farmers, who were mainly of Near Eastern origin but also harboured west European hunter-gatherer related ancestry. We model these populations' deep relationships and show that early European farmers had similar to 44% ancestry from a 'basal Eurasian' population that split before the diversification of other non-African lineages.","Lazaridis, Iosif; Patterson, Nick; Mittnik, Alissa; Renaud, Gabriel; Mallick, Swapan; Kirsanow, Karola; Sudmant, Peter H.; Schraiber, Joshua G.; Castellano, Sergi; Lipson, Mark; Berger, Bonnie; Economou, Christos; Bollongino, Ruth; Fu, Qiaomei; Bos, Kirsten I.; Nordenfelt, Susanne; Li, Heng; de Filippo, Cesare; Pruefer, Kay; Sawyer, Susanna; Posth, Cosimo; Haak, Wolfgang; Hallgren, Fredrik; Fornander, Elin; Rohland, Nadin; Delsate, Dominique; Francken, Michael; Guinet, Jean-Michel; Wahl, Joachim; Ayodo, George; Babiker, Hamza A.; Bailliet, Graciela; Balanovska, Elena; Balanovsky, Oleg; Barrantes, Ramiro; Bedoya, Gabriel; Ben-Ami, Haim; Bene, Judit; Berrada, Fouad; Bravi, Claudio M.; Brisighelli, Francesca; Busby, George B.

The SAR has traditionally been approximated by a power law(1), but recent theories predict a triphasic SAR in logarithmic space, characterized by steeper increases in species richness at both small and large spatial scales(2-6). Here we uncover such universally upward accelerating SARs for amphibians, birds and mammals across the world's major landmasses. Although apparently taxon-specific and continent-specific, all curves collapse into one universal function after the area is rescaled by using the mean range sizes of taxa within continents. In addition, all EARs approximately follow a power law with a slope close to 1, indicating that for most spatial scales there is roughly proportional species extinction with area loss. These patterns can be predicted by a simulation model based on the random placement of contiguous ranges within a domain. The universality of SARs and EARs after rescaling implies that both total and endemic species richness within an area, and also their rate of change with area, can be estimated by using only the knowledge of mean geographic range size in the region and mean species richness at one spatial scale.","Storch, David; Keil, Petr; Jetz, Walter","Storch, D; Keil, P; Jetz, W",78.0,"[Storch, David] Charles Univ Prague, Ctr Theoret Study, Prague 11000 1, Czech Republic; [Storch, David] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Prague 11000 1, Czech Republic; [Storch, David] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Ecol, CR-12844 Prague 2, Czech Republic; [Keil, Petr; Jetz, Walter] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11226,Article,1476-4687,storch@cts.cuni.cz,+,"Grant Agency of the Czech Republic [P505/11/2387]; Czech Ministry of Education [MSM0021620845]; EU FP7 SCALES project [26852]; National Science Foundation [DBI 0960550, DEB 1026764]; NASA Biodiversity Program [NNX11AP72G]","We thank J.

103,162,482.0,"The cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent catabolite repression effect in Escherichia coli is among the most intensely studied regulatory processes in biology. However, the physiological function(s) of cAMP signalling and its molecular triggers remain elusive. Here we use a quantitative physiological approach to show that cAMP signalling tightly coordinates the expression of catabolic proteins with biosynthetic and ribosomal proteins, in accordance with the cellular metabolic needs during exponential growth. The expression of carbon catabolic genes increased linearly with decreasing growth rates upon limitation of carbon influx, but decreased linearly with decreasing growth rate upon limitation of nitrogen or sulphur influx. In contrast, the expression of biosynthetic genes showed the opposite linear growth-rate dependence as the catabolic genes. A coarse-grained mathematical model provides a quantitative framework for understanding and predicting gene expression responses to catabolic and anabolic limitations. A scheme of integral feedback control featuring the inhibition of cAMP signalling by metabolic precursors is proposed and validated. These results reveal a key physiological role of cAMP-dependent catabolite repression: to ensure that proteomic resources are spent on distinct metabolic sectors as needed in different nutrient environments. Our findings underscore the power of quantitative physiology in unravelling the underlying functions of complex molecular signalling networks.","You, Conghui; Okano, Hiroyuki; Hui, Sheng; Zhang, Zhongge; Kim, Minsu; Gunderson, Carl W.; Wang, Yi-Ping; Lenz, Peter; Yan, Dalai; Hwa, Terence","You, CH; Okano, H; Hui, S; Zhang, ZG; Kim, M; Gunderson, CW; Wang, YP; Lenz, P; Yan, DL; Hwa, T",301.0,"[You, Conghui; Okano, Hiroyuki; Hui, Sheng; Kim, Minsu; Hwa, Terence] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Phys, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [You, Conghui; Okano, Hiroyuki; Zhang, Zhongge; Gunderson, Carl W.; Hwa, Terence] Univ Calif San Diego, Div Biol Sci, Sect Mol Biol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Hui, Sheng; Hwa, Terence] Univ Calif San Diego, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Wang, Yi-Ping] Peking Univ, Coll Life Sci, State Key Lab Prot & Plant Gene Res, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Lenz, Peter] Univ Marburg, Dept Phys, D-35032 Marburg, Germany; [Lenz, Peter] Univ Marburg, Ctr Synthet Microbiol, D-35032 Marburg, Germany; [Yan, Dalai] Indiana Univ Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12446,Article,,hwa@ucsd.edu,306,Human Frontiers in Science Program [RGP0022]; NSF [PHY1058793]; NSF through the Center for Theoretical Biological Physics [PHY0822283],"We are grateful to R.

104,66,281.0,"Drosophila endogenous small RNAs are categorized according to their mechanisms of biogenesis and the Argonaute protein to which they bind. MicroRNAs are a class of ubiquitously expressed RNAs of 22 nucleotides in length, which arise from structured precursors through the action of Drosha - Pasha and Dicer- 1-Loquacious complexes(1-7). These join Argonaute-1 to regulate gene expression(8,9). A second endogenous small RNA class, the Piwi-interacting RNAs, bind Piwi proteins and suppress transposons(10,11). Piwi- interacting RNAs are restricted to the gonad, and at least a subset of these arises by Piwi- catalysed cleavage of single-stranded RNAs(12,13). Here we show that Drosophila generates a third small RNA class, endogenous small interfering RNAs, in both gonadal and somatic tissues. Production of these RNAs requires Dicer- 2, but a subset depends preferentially on Loquacious(1,4,5) rather than the canonical Dicer- 2 partner, R2D2 ( ref. 14). Endogenous small interfering RNAs arise both from convergent transcription units and from structured genomic loci in a tissue- specific fashion. They predominantly join Argonaute- 2 and have the capacity, as a class, to target both protein- coding genes and mobile elements. These observations expand the repertoire of small RNAs in Drosophila, adding a class that blurs distinctions based on known biogenesis mechanisms and functional roles.","Czech, Benjamin; Malone, Colin D.; Zhou, Rui; Stark, Alexander; Schlingeheyde, Catherine; Dus, Monica; Perrimon, Norbert; Kellis, Manolis; Wohlschlegel, James A.; Sachidanandam, Ravi; Hannon, Gregory J.; Brennecke, Julius","Czech, B; Malone, CD; Zhou, R; Stark, A; Schlingeheyde, C; Dus, M; Perrimon, N; Kellis, M; Wohlschlegel, JA; Sachidanandam, R; Hannon, GJ; Brennecke, J",798.0,"[Czech, Benjamin; Malone, Colin D.; Schlingeheyde, Catherine; Dus, Monica; Sachidanandam, Ravi; Hannon, Gregory J.; Brennecke, Julius] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Watson Sch Biol Sci, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; [Zhou, Rui; Perrimon, Norbert] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Stark, Alexander; Kellis, Manolis] MIT, Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02141 USA; [Stark, Alexander; Kellis, Manolis] Harvard Univ, Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02141 USA; [Stark, Alexander] MIT, Comp Sci & Artificial Intelligence Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Wohlschlegel, James A.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07007,Article,,hannon@cshl.edu; brenneck@cshl.edu,U7,"NHGRI NIH HHS [U54 HG004570-01, U01 HG004264, U01 HG004264-02, U54 HG004555, U54 HG004555-01, U54 HG004570]",,308UK,,,C-ELEGANS; MICRORNA MATURATION; ARGONAUTE PROTEINS; DISTINCT ROLES; BIOGENESIS; INITIATION; GERMLINE; ELEMENTS; REVEALS; VIRUSES,7196.0,NATURE,Nature,English,32.0,No,"Stark, Alexander/0000-0003-2611-0841; Brennecke, Julius/0000-0002-5141-0814; Czech, Benjamin/0000-0001-8471-0007; sachidanandam, ravi/0000-0001-9844-4459; Perrimon, Norbert/0000-0001-7542-472X","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",5-Jun,7.0,LONDON,18463631.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,"Stark, Alexander/D-1473-2012; Brennecke, Julius/C-1626-2015","Hannon, GJ (reprint author), Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Watson Sch Biol Sci, 1 Bungtown Rd, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,404.0,An endogenous small interfering RNA pathway in Drosophila,0.0,17.0,WOS:000256415300047,281.0,453,Multidisciplinary Sciences,420,julius,brennecke,14144.0,134,male,1.0,-i9ABRgAAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",34813616,1,8643335,1,Pension Schöller (1952 film),Pension Schöller (1952 film),0,0
105,119,437.0,"Fructose is a major component of dietary sugar and its overconsumption exacerbates key pathological features of metabolic syndrome. The central fructose-metabolising enzyme is ketohexokinase (KHK), which exists in two isoforms: KHK-A and KHK-C, generated through mutually exclusive alternative splicing of KHK pre-mRNAs. KHK-C displays superior affinity for fructose compared with KHK-A and is produced primarily in the liver, thus restricting fructose metabolism almost exclusively to this organ. Here we show that myocardial hypoxia actuates fructose metabolism in human and mouse models of pathological cardiac hypertrophy through hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1 alpha) activation of SF3B1 and SF3B1-mediated splice switching of KHK-A to KHK-C. Heart-specific depletion of SF3B1 orgenetic ablation of Khk, but not Khk-A alone, in mice, suppresses pathological stress-induced fructose metabolism, growth and contractile dysfunction, thus defining signalling components and molecular underpinnings of a fructose metabolism regulatory system crucial for pathological growth.","Mirtschink, Peter; Krishnan, Jaya; Grimm, Fiona; Sarre, Alexandre; Hoerl, Manuel; Kayikci, Melis; Fankhauser, Niklaus; Christinat, Yann; Cortijo, Cedric; Feehan, Owen; Vukolic, Ana; Sossalla, Samuel; Stehr, Sebastian N.; Ule, Jernej; Zamboni, Nicola; Pedrazzini, Thierry; Krek, Wilhelm","Mirtschink, P; Krishnan, J; Grimm, F; Sarre, A; Horl, M; Kayikci, M; Fankhauser, N; Christinat, Y; Cortijo, C; Feehan, O; Vukolic, A; Sossalla, S; Stehr, SN; Ule, J; Zamboni, N; Pedrazzini, T; Krek, W",444.0,"[Mirtschink, Peter; Krishnan, Jaya; Grimm, Fiona; Fankhauser, Niklaus; Christinat, Yann; Cortijo, Cedric; Feehan, Owen; Vukolic, Ana; Krek, Wilhelm] ETH, Inst Mol Hlth Sci, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Sarre, Alexandre; Pedrazzini, Thierry] Univ Lausanne, Dept Med, CH-1011 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Hoerl, Manuel; Zamboni, Nicola] ETH, Inst Mol Syst Biol, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Kayikci, Melis; Ule, Jernej] MRC Lab Mol Biol, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England; [Sossalla, Samuel] Univ Med Gottingen, Klin Kardiol & Pneumol, D-37075 Gottingen, Germany; [Sossalla, Samuel] DZHK German Ctr Cardiovasc Res, Partner Site Gottingen, Hamburg, Germany; [Stehr, Sebastian N.] Univ Hosp Jena, Dept Anesthesiol & Crit Care Med, D-07747 Jena, Germany",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14508,Article,1476-4687,wilhelm.krek@biol.ethz.ch,+,Sinergia (Swiss National Science Foundation); Swiss Heart Foundation,"We thank S.

In the absence of DGCR8 (Dgcr8(-/-)), a protein required for microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis, mouse ESCs are unable to silence self-renewal. Here we show that the introduction of let-7 miRNAs-a family of miRNAs highly expressed in somatic cells-can suppress self-renewal in Dgcr8(-/-) but not wild-type ESCs. Introduction of ESC cell cycle regulating (ESCC) miRNAs into the Dgcr8(-/-) ESCs blocks the capacity of let-7 to suppress self-renewal. Profiling and bioinformatic analyses show that let-7 inhibits whereas ESCC miRNAs indirectly activate numerous self-renewal genes. Furthermore, inhibition of the let-7 family promotes de-differentiation of somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells. Together, these findings show how the ESCC and let-7 miRNAs act through common pathways to alternatively stabilize the self-renewing versus differentiated cell fates.","Melton, Collin; Judson, Robert L.; Blelloch, Robert","Melton, C; Judson, RL; Blelloch, R",621.0,"[Melton, Collin; Judson, Robert L.; Blelloch, Robert] Univ Calif San Francisco, Eli & Edythe Broad Ctr Regenerat Med & Stem Cell, Program Biomed Sci, Ctr Reprod Sci, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Melton, Collin; Judson, Robert L.; Blelloch, Robert] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Urol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08725,Article,,blellochr@stemcell.ucsf.edu,U45,"National Institutes of Health (NIH) [K08 NS48118, R01 NS057221]; California Institute of Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) [RS1-00161, RN2-00906]; American Health Assistance Foundation; Pew Charitable Trust; National Science Foundation (NSF)","We would like to thank M.

108,16,368.0,"Electrons in a single sheet of graphene behave quite differently from those in traditional two-dimensional electron systems. Like massless relativistic particles, they have linear dispersion and chiral eigenstates. Furthermore, two sets of electrons centred at different points in reciprocal space ('valleys') have this dispersion, giving rise to valley degeneracy. The symmetry between valleys, together with spin symmetry, leads to a fourfold quartet degeneracy of the Landau levels, observed as peaks in the density of states produced by an applied magnetic field. Recent electron transport measurements have observed the lifting of the fourfold degeneracy in very large applied magnetic fields, separating the quartet into integer(1-4) and, more recently, fractional(5,6) levels. The exact nature of the broken-symmetry states that form within the Landau levels and lift these degeneracies is unclear at present and is a topic of intense theoretical debate(7-11). Here we study the detailed features of the four quantum states that make up a degenerate graphene Landau level. We use high-resolution scanning tunnelling spectroscopy at temperatures as low as 10 mK in an applied magnetic field to study the top layer of multilayer epitaxial graphene. When the Fermi level lies inside the fourfold Landau manifold, significant electron correlation effects result in an enhanced valley splitting for even filling factors, and an enhanced electron spin splitting for odd filling factors. Most unexpectedly, we observe states with Landau level filling factors of 7/2, 9/2 and 11/2, suggestive of new many-body states in graphene.","Song, Young Jae; Otte, Alexander F.; Kuk, Young; Hu, Yike; Torrance, David B.; First, Phillip N.; de Heer, Walt A.; Min, Hongki; Adam, Shaffique; Stiles, Mark D.; MacDonald, Allan H.; Stroscio, Joseph A.","Song, YJ; Otte, AF; Kuk, Y; Hu, YK; Torrance, DB; First, PN; de Heer, WA; Min, HK; Adam, S; Stiles, MD; MacDonald, AH; Stroscio, JA",185.0,"[Song, Young Jae; Otte, Alexander F.; Min, Hongki; Adam, Shaffique; Stiles, Mark D.; Stroscio, Joseph A.] NIST, Ctr Nanoscale Sci & Technol, Gaithersburg, MD 20899 USA; [Song, Young Jae; Otte, Alexander F.; Min, Hongki] Univ Maryland, Maryland NanoCtr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Kuk, Young] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Seoul 1517474, South Korea; [Hu, Yike; Torrance, David B.; First, Phillip N.; de Heer, Walt A.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Phys, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [MacDonald, Allan H.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Phys, Austin, TX 78712 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09330,Article,,joseph.stroscio@nist.gov,189,"Korean Government (MOEHRD) [KRF- 2006-214-C00022]; NSF [DMR-0820382 [MRSEC], DMR-0804908, DMR-0606489]; Welch Foundation; Semiconductor Research Corporation","We thank N.

109,210,397.0,"Piwi proteins and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) have conserved functions in transposon silencing(1). The murine Piwi proteins Mili and Miwi2 (also called Piwil2 and Piwil4, respectively) direct epigenetic LINE1 and intracisternal A particle transposon silencing during genome reprogramming in the embryonic male germ line(2-4). Piwi proteins are proposed to be piRNA-guided endonucleases that initiate secondary piRNA biogenesis(5-7); however, the actual contribution of their endonuclease activities to piRNA biogenesis and transposon silencing remain unknown. To investigate the role of Piwi-catalysed endonucleolytic activity, we engineered point mutations in mice that substitute the second aspartic acid to an alanine in the DDH catalytic triad of Mili and Miwi2, generating the Mili(DAH) and Miwi2(DAH) alleles, respectively. Analysis of Mili-bound piRNAs from homozygous Mili(DAH) fetal gonadocytes revealed a failure of transposon piRNA amplification, resulting in the marked reduction of piRNA bound within Miwi2 ribonuclear particles. We find that Mili-mediated piRNA amplification is selectively required for LINE1, but not intracisternal A particle, silencing. The defective piRNA pathway in Mili(DAH) mice results in spermatogenic failure and sterility. Surprisingly, homozygous Miwi2(DAH) mice are fertile, transposon silencing is established normally and no defects in secondary piRNA biogenesis are observed. In addition, the hallmarks of piRNA amplification are observed in Miwi2-deficient gonadocytes. We conclude that cycles of intra-Mili secondary piRNA biogenesis fuel piRNA amplification that is absolutely required for LINE1 silencing.","De Fazio, Serena; Bartonicek, Nenad; Di Giacomo, Monica; Abreu-Goodger, Cei; Sankar, Aditya; Funaya, Charlotta; Antony, Claude; Moreira, Pedro N.; Enright, Anton J.; O'Carroll, Donal","De Fazio, S; Bartonicek, N; Di Giacomo, M; Abreu-Goodger, C; Sankar, A; Funaya, C; Antony, C; Moreira, PN; Enright, AJ; O'Carroll, D",259.0,"[De Fazio, Serena; Di Giacomo, Monica; Sankar, Aditya; Moreira, Pedro N.; O'Carroll, Donal] European Mol Biol Lab, Mouse Biol Unit, I-00015 Monterotondo, Italy; [Bartonicek, Nenad; Abreu-Goodger, Cei; Enright, Anton J.] European Mol Biol Lab, European Bioinformat Inst, Cambridge CB10 1SD, England; [Funaya, Charlotta; Antony, Claude] European Mol Biol Lab, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10547,Article,1476-4687,ocarroll@embl.it,U148,,,857TR,,,DNA METHYLATION; FAMILY-MEMBERS; PIWI PROTEINS; GERM-CELLS; MICE; PATHWAY; GENE; MIRNA; RISC; RNAS,7376.0,NATURE,Nature,English,40.0,No,"Abreu-Goodger, Cei/0000-0001-8302-9893; Enright, Anton/0000-0002-6090-3100; Bartonicek, Nenad/0000-0003-2144-1887; Sankar, Aditya/0000-0002-1840-3356; O'Carroll, Donal/0000-0002-8626-2217","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",8-Dec,7.0,LONDON,22020280.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2011.0,"Abreu-Goodger, Cei/A-1268-2010; Enright, Anton/F-3094-2011; Bartonicek, Nenad/B-6675-2016","O'Carroll, D (reprint author), European Mol Biol Lab, Mouse Biol Unit, Via Ramarini 32, I-00015 Monterotondo, Italy.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,114.0,The endonuclease activity of Mili fuels piRNA amplification that silences LINE1 elements,1.0,19.0,WOS:000297744200055,397.0,480,Multidisciplinary Sciences,117,donal,o'carroll,15090.0,11,male,1.0,KX0vLLQAAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",6319420,1,na,0,O'Carroll,na,1,0
110,132,298.0,"Seismic and geodetic observations in subduction zone forearcs indicate that slow earthquakes, including episodic tremor and slip, recur at intervals of less than six months to more than two years(1,2). In Cascadia, slow slip is segmented along strike(3) and tremor data show a gradation from large, infrequent slip episodes to small, frequent slip events with increasing depth of the plate interface(4). Observations(5-7) and models(8,9) of slow slip and tremor require the presence of near-lithostatic pore-fluid pressures in slow-earthquake source regions; however, direct evidence of factors controlling the variability in recurrence times is elusive. Here we compile seismic data from subduction zone forearcs exhibiting recurring slow earthquakes and show that the average ratio of compressional (P)-wave velocity to shear (S)-wave velocity (v(P)/v(S)) of the overlying forearc crust ranges between 1.6 and 2.0 and is linearly related to the average recurrence time of slow earthquakes. In northern Cascadia, forearc v(P)/v(S) values decrease with increasing depth of the plate interface and with decreasing tremor-episode recurrence intervals. Low v(P)/v(S) values require a large addition of quartz in a mostly mafic forearc environment(10,11). We propose that silica enrichment varying from 5 per cent to 15 per cent by volume from slab-derived fluids and upward mineralization in quartz veins(12) can explain the range of observed v(P)/v(S) values as well as the downdip decrease in v(P)/v(S). The solubility of silica depends on temperature(13), and deposition prevails near the base of the forearc crust(11). We further propose that the strong temperature dependence of healing and permeability reduction in silica-rich fault gouge via dissolution-precipitation creep(14) can explain the reduction in tremor recurrence time with progressive silica enrichment. Lower gouge permeability at higher temperatures leads to faster fluid overpressure development and low effective fault-normal stress, and therefore shorter recurrence times. Our results also agree with numerical models of slip stabilization under fault zone dilatancy strengthening(15) caused by decreasing fluid pressure as pore space increases. This implies that temperature-dependent silica deposition, permeability reduction and fluid overpressure development control dilatancy and slow-earthquake behaviour.","Audet, Pascal; Buergmann, Roland","Audet, P; Burgmann, R",389.0,"[Audet, Pascal] Univ Ottawa, Dept Earth Sci, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Buergmann, Roland] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Buergmann, Roland] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley Seismol Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13391,Article,1476-4687,pascal.audet@uottawa.ca,+,"Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (Canada); Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science (University of California, Berkeley)","Data used in this study come from the Japan Meteorological Agency, New Zealand National Seismograph Network, and the Tectonic Observatory (Caltech).

112,93,25.0,"X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements provide us with atomically resolved structures of an ever-growing number of biomolecules. These static structural snapshots are important to our understanding of biomolecular function, but real biomolecules are dynamic entities that often exploit conformational changes and transient molecular interactions to perform their tasks. Nuclear magnetic resonance methods can follow such structural changes, but only on millisecond timescales under non-equilibrium conditions. Time-resolved X-ray crystallography has recently been used to monitor the photodissociation of CO from myoglobin on a subnanosecond timescale(1), yet remains challenging to apply more widely. In contrast, two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy, which maps vibrational coupling between molecular groups and hence their relative positions and orientations(2-11), is now routinely used to study equilibrium processes on picosecond timescales. Here we show that the extension of this method into the non-equilibrium regime(12,13) allows us to observe in real time in a short peptide the weakening of an intramolecular hydrogen bond and concomitant opening of a beta-turn. We find that the rate of this process is two orders of magnitude faster than the 'folding speed limit' established for contact formation between protein side chains(14).","Kolano, Christoph; Helbing, Jan; Kozinski, Mariusz; Sander, Wolfram; Hamm, Peter","Kolano, C; Helbing, J; Kozinski, M; Sander, W; Hamm, P",469.0,"Univ Zurich, Inst Phys Chem, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; Ruhr Univ Bochum, Lehrstuhl Organ Chem 2, D-44801 Bochum, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature05352,Article,,c.kolano@pci.unizh.ch; p.hamm@pci.unizh.ch,472,,,108BQ,,,PICOSECOND CONFORMATIONAL TRANSITION; SPEED LIMIT; VIBRATIONAL SPECTROSCOPY; PHOTOSWITCHABLE PEPTIDE; ALPHA-HELIX; 2D IR; PROTEIN; WATER; ISOTOPOMERS; DISULFIDE,7118.0,NATURE,Nature,English,28.0,No,"Hamm, Peter/0000-0003-1106-6032","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",23-Nov,4.0,LONDON,17122853.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,"Helbing, Jan/A-5609-2013; Hamm, Peter/O-1247-2013","Kolano, C (reprint author), Univ Zurich, Inst Phys Chem, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,239.0,Watching hydrogen-bond dynamics in a beta-turn by transient two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy,9.0,107.0,WOS:000242215700042,25.0,444,Multidisciplinary Sciences,243,peter,hamm,13194.0,4373,male,1.0,YGjk6v0AAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",179125,1,3634471,1,Hamm,Hamm,1,1
113,73,479.0,"The thermal structure of the crust strongly influences deformation, metamorphism and plutonism(1-3). Models for the geothermal gradient in stable crust predict a steady increase of temperature with depth. This thermal structure, however, is incompatible with observations from high- temperature metamorphic terranes exhumed in orogens(1,4,5,6). Global compilations(7) of peak conditions in high- temperature metamorphic terranes define relatively narrow ranges of peak temperatures over a wide range in pressure, for both isothermal decompression and isobaric cooling paths. Here we develop simple one- dimensional thermal models that include the effects of melt migration. These models show that long- lived plutonism results in a quasi- steady- state geotherm with a rapid temperature increase in the upper crust and nearly isothermal conditions in the middle and lower crust. The models also predict that the upward advection of heat by melt generates granulite facies metamorphism, and widespread andalusite - sillimanite metamorphism in the upper crust. Once the quasi- steady- state thermal profile is reached, the middle and lower crust are greatly weakened due to high temperatures and anatectic conditions, thus setting the stage for gravitational collapse(8), exhumation and isothermal decompression after the onset of plutonism. Near- iso-thermal conditions in the middle and lower crust result from the thermal buffering effect of dehydration melting reactions that, in part, control the shape of the geotherm.","Depine, Gabriela V.; Andronicos, Christopher L.; Phipps-Morgan, Jason","Depine, GV; Andronicos, CL; Phipps-Morgan, J",80.0,"[Depine, Gabriela V.; Andronicos, Christopher L.; Phipps-Morgan, Jason] Cornell Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06689,Article,1476-4687,gvd2@cornell.edu,83,,,269SZ,,,THERMAL-PROCESSES; BRITISH-COLUMBIA; OROGENIC BELTS; GRANITE; FLOW; METAMORPHISM; EMPLACEMENT; MOUNTAINS; ANATEXIS; SOLIDUS,7183.0,NATURE,Nature,English,34.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",6-Mar,4.0,LONDON,18322532.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,,"Depine, GV (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Snee Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,34.0,Near-isothermal conditions in the middle and lower crust induced by melt migration,2.0,19.0,WOS:000253671900050,479.0,452,Multidisciplinary Sciences,34,jason,phipps-morgan,9583.0,4927,male,1.0,D2TRutgAAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",45641474,1,673711,1,Morgan (2016 film),Morgan (2016 film),0,0
114,208,350.0,"Methylation of cytosines is an essential epigenetic modification in mammalian genomes, yet the rules that govern methylation patterns remain largely elusive. To gain insights into this process, we generated base-pair-resolution mouse methylomes in stem cells and neuronal progenitors. Advanced quantitative analysis identified low-methylated regions (LMRs) with an average methylation of 30%. These represent CpG-poor distal regulatory regions as evidenced by location, DNase I hypersensitivity, presence of enhancer chromatin marks and enhancer activity in reporter assays. LMRs are occupied by DNA-binding factors and their binding is necessary and sufficient to create LMRs. A comparison of neuronal and stem-cell methylomes confirms this dependency, as cell-type-specific LMRs are occupied by cell-type-specific transcription factors. This study provides methylome references for the mouse and shows that DNA-binding factors locally influence DNA methylation, enabling the identification of active regulatory regions.","Stadler, Michael B.; Murr, Rabih; Burger, Lukas; Ivanek, Robert; Lienert, Florian; Schoeler, Anne; Wirbelauer, Christiane; Oakeley, Edward J.; Gaidatzis, Dimos; Tiwari, Vijay K.; Schuebeler, Dirk","Stadler, MB; Murr, R; Burger, L; Ivanek, R; Lienert, F; Scholer, A; Wirbelauer, C; Oakeley, EJ; Gaidatzis, D; Tiwari, VK; Schubeler, D",490.0,"[Stadler, Michael B.; Murr, Rabih; Burger, Lukas; Ivanek, Robert; Lienert, Florian; Schoeler, Anne; Wirbelauer, Christiane; Gaidatzis, Dimos; Tiwari, Vijay K.; Schuebeler, Dirk] Friedrich Miescher Inst Biomed Res, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland; [Stadler, Michael B.; Burger, Lukas; Schoeler, Anne; Gaidatzis, Dimos] Swiss Inst Bioinformat, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland; [Lienert, Florian; Schoeler, Anne; Schuebeler, Dirk] Univ Basel, Fac Sci, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; [Oakeley, Edward J.] Novartis Inst BioMed Res, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10716,Article,1476-4687,dirk@fmi.ch,495,EMBO; Marie Curie International Incoming fellowship; Novartis Research Foundation; European Union (NoE) [FP7-HEALTH-2010-257082]; European Research Council (ERC EpiGePlas); SNF; Swiss initiative in Systems Biology,"The authors thank A.

115,214,490.0,"Technological advances in DNA recovery and sequencing have drastically expanded the scope of genetic analyses of ancient specimens to the extent that full genomic investigations are now feasible and are quickly becoming standard(1). This trend has important implications for infectious disease research because genomic data from ancient microbes may help to elucidate mechanisms of pathogen evolution and adaptation for emerging and re-emerging infections. Here we report a reconstructed ancient genome of Yersinia pestis at 30-fold average coverage from Black Death victims securely dated to episodes of pestilence-associated mortality in London, England, 1348-1350. Genetic architecture and phylogenetic analysis indicate that the ancient organismis ancestral to most extant strains and sits very close to the ancestral node of all Y. pestis commonly associated with human infection. Temporal estimates suggest that the Black Death of 1347-1351 was the main historical event responsible for the introduction and widespread dissemination of the ancestor to all currently circulating Y. pestis strains pathogenic to humans, and further indicates that contemporary Y. pestis epidemics have their origins in the medieval era. Comparisons against modern genomes reveal no unique derived positions in the medieval organism, indicating that the perceived increased virulence of the disease during the Black Death may not have been due to bacterial phenotype. These findings support the notion that factors other than microbial genetics, such as environment, vector dynamics and host susceptibility, should be at the forefront of epidemiological discussions regarding emerging Y. pestis infections.","Bos, Kirsten I.; Schuenemann, Verena J.; Golding, G.

116,121,73.0,"Mutations that deregulate Notch1 and Ras/phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt signalling are prevalent in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL), and often coexist. Here we show that the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 is active against primary T-ALLs from wild-type and Kras(G12D) mice, and addition of the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 increases its efficacy. Mice invariably relapsed after treatment with drug-resistant clones, most of which unexpectedly had reduced levels of activated Notch1 protein, downregulated many Notch1 target genes, and exhibited cross-resistance to gamma-secretase inhibitors. Multiple resistant primary T-ALLs that emerged in vivo did not contain somatic Notch1 mutations present in the parental leukaemia. Importantly, resistant clones upregulated PI3K signalling. Consistent with these data, inhibiting Notch1 activated the PI3K pathway, providing a likely mechanism for selection against oncogenic Notch1 signalling. These studies validate PI3K as a therapeutic target in T-ALL and raise the unexpected possibility that dual inhibition of PI3K and Notch1 signalling could promote drug resistance in T-ALL.","Dail, Monique; Wong, Jason; Lawrence, Jessica; O'Connor, Daniel; Nakitandwe, Joy; Chen, Shann-Ching; Xu, Jin; Lee, Leslie B.; Akagi, Keiko; Li, Qing; Aster, Jon C.; Pear, Warren S.; Downing, James R.; Sampath, Deepak; Shannon, Kevin","Dail, M; Wong, J; Lawrence, J; O'Connor, D; Nakitandwe, J; Chen, SC; Xu, J; Lee, LB; Akagi, K; Li, Q; Aster, JC; Pear, WS; Downing, JR; Sampath, D; Shannon, K",512.0,"[Dail, Monique; Wong, Jason; Lawrence, Jessica; O'Connor, Daniel; Xu, Jin; Shannon, Kevin] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pediat, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Dail, Monique; Wong, Jason; Lawrence, Jessica; O'Connor, Daniel; Xu, Jin; Shannon, Kevin] Univ Calif San Francisco, Benniof Childrens Hosp, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Nakitandwe, Joy; Chen, Shann-Ching; Downing, James R.] St Jude Childrens Res Hosp, Dept Pathol, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Lee, Leslie B.; Sampath, Deepak] Genentech Inc, Dept Translat Oncol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Akagi, Keiko] Ohio State Univ, Dept Mol Virol Immunol & Med Genet, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Li, Qing] Univ Michigan, Dept Med, Div Haematol Oncol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Aster, Jon C.] Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Pear, Warren S.] Univ Penn, Abramson Family Canc Res Inst, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Pear, Warren S.] Univ Penn, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Perelman Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13495,Article,1476-4687,shannonk@peds.ucsf.edu,+,"William Lawrence and Blanche Hughes Foundation; Specialized Center of Research (SCOR) from the Leukaemia and Lymphoma Society of America [7019, 7703]; National Institutes of Health [R37 CA72614, R01 CA180037, K99 CA157950, K08 CA134649, P01 CA119070]; ALSAC of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital; Ohio Supercomputer Center [PAS0425]; Ohio Cancer Research Associate [GRT00024299]; American Cancer Society (ACS)","This work was supported by grants from the William Lawrence and Blanche Hughes Foundation to J.C.A. and K.

117,187,74.0,"Antigen-presenting molecules, encoded by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and CD1 family, bind peptide- and lipid-based antigens, respectively, for recognition by T cells. Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are an abundant population of innate-like T cells in humans that are activated by an antigen(s) bound to the MHC class I-like molecule MR1. Although the identity of MR1-restricted antigen(s) is unknown, it is present in numerous bacteria and yeast. Here we show that the structure and chemistry within the antigen-binding cleft of MR1 is distinct from the MHC and CD1 families. MR1 is ideally suited to bind ligands originating from vitamin metabolites. The structure of MR1 in complex with 6-formyl pterin, a folic acid (vitamin B9) metabolite, shows the pterin ring sequestered within MR1. Furthermore, we characterize related MR1-restricted vitamin derivatives, originating from the bacterial riboflavin (vitamin B2) biosynthetic pathway, which specifically and potently activate MAIT cells. Accordingly, we show that metabolites of vitamin B represent a class of antigen that are presented by MR1 for MAIT-cell immunosurveillance. As many vitamin biosynthetic pathways are unique to bacteria and yeast, our data suggest that MAIT cells use these metabolites to detect microbial infection.","Kjer-Nielsen, Lars; Patel, Onisha; Corbett, Alexandra J.; Le Nours, Jerome; Meehan, Bronwyn; Liu, Ligong; Bhati, Mugdha; Chen, Zhenjun; Kostenko, Lyudmila; Reantragoon, Rangsima; Williamson, Nicholas A.; Purcell, Anthony W.; Dudek, Nadine L.; McConville, Malcolm J.; O'Hair, Richard A.

118,48,353.0,"One defining goal of synthetic biology is the development of engineering- based approaches that enable the construction of gene- regulatory networks according to 'design specifications' generated from computational modelling(1-6). This approach provides a systematic framework for exploring how a given regulatory network generates a particular phenotypic behaviour. Several fundamental gene circuits have been developed using this approach, including toggle switches(7) and oscillators(8-10), and these have been applied in new contexts such as triggered biofilm development(11) and cellular population control(12). Here we describe an engineered genetic oscillator in Escherichia coli that is fast, robust and persistent, with tunable oscillatory periods as fast as 13 min. The oscillator was designed using a previously modelled network architecture comprising linked positive and negative feedback loops(1,13). Using a microfluidic platform tailored for single- cell microscopy, we precisely control environmental conditions and monitor oscillations in individual cells through multiple cycles. Experiments reveal remarkable robustness and persistence of oscillations in the designed circuit; almost every cell exhibited large- amplitude fluorescence oscillations throughout observation runs. The oscillatory period can be tuned by altering inducer levels, temperature and the media source. Computational modelling demonstrates that the key design principle for constructing a robust oscillator is a time delay in the negative feedback loop, which can mechanistically arise from the cascade of cellular processes involved in forming a functional transcription factor. The positive feedback loop increases the robustness of the oscillations and allows for greater tunability. Examination of our refined model suggested the existence of a simplified oscillator design without positive feedback, and we construct an oscillator strain confirming this computational prediction.","Stricker, Jesse; Cookson, Scott; Bennett, Matthew R.; Mather, William H.; Tsimring, Lev S.; Hasty, Jeff","Stricker, J; Cookson, S; Bennett, MR; Mather, WH; Tsimring, LS; Hasty, J",516.0,"[Stricker, Jesse; Cookson, Scott; Bennett, Matthew R.; Mather, William H.; Hasty, Jeff] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Bioengn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Bennett, Matthew R.; Tsimring, Lev S.; Hasty, Jeff] Univ Calif San Diego, Inst Nonlinear Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07389,Article,,hasty@bioeng.ucsd.edu,U39,National Institutes of Health [GM69811-01]; US Department of Defense,"We thank H.

120,41,48.0,"Dopamine signalling regulates a variety of complex behaviours, and defects in dopamine neuron function or survival result in severe human pathologies, such as Parkinson's disease(1). The common denominator of all dopamine neurons is the expression of dopamine pathway genes, which code for a set of phylogenetically conserved proteins involved in dopamine synthesis and transport. Gene regulatory mechanisms that result in the direct activation of dopamine pathway genes and thereby ultimately determine the identity of dopamine neurons are poorly understood in all systems studied so far(2). Here we show that a simple cis-regulatory element, the dopamine (DA) motif, controls the expression of all dopamine pathway genes in all dopaminergic cell types in Caenorhabditis elegans. The DA motif is activated by the ETS transcription factor AST-1. Loss of ast-1 results in the failure of all distinct dopaminergic neuronal subtypes to terminally differentiate. Ectopic expression of ast-1 is sufficient to activate the dopamine pathway in some cellular contexts. Vertebrate dopamine pathway genes also contain phylogenetically conserved DA motifs that can be activated by the mouse ETS transcription factor Etv1 (also known as ER81), and a specific class of dopamine neurons fails to differentiate in mice lacking Etv1. Moreover, ectopic Etv1 expression induces dopaminergic fate marker expression in neuronal primary cultures. Mouse Etv1 can also functionally substitute for ast-1 in C. elegans. Our studies reveal a simple and apparently conserved regulatory logic of dopamine neuron terminal differentiation and may provide new entry points into the diagnosis or therapy of conditions in which dopamine neurons are defective.","Flames, Nuria; Hobert, Oliver","Flames, N; Hobert, O",885.0,"[Flames, Nuria; Hobert, Oliver] Columbia Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, Med Ctr, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10032 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07929,Article,,nf2171@columbia.edu; or38@columbia.edu,U7,"National Institutes of Health [R01NS039996-05, R01NS050266-03]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; EMBO; Marie Curie Outgoing International fellowship","We thank Q.

121,161,471.0,"Mutualistic networks are formed when the interactions between two classes of species are mutually beneficial. They are important examples of cooperation shaped by evolution. Mutualism between animals and plants has a key role in the organization of ecological communities(1-3). Such networks in ecology have generally evolved a nested architecture(4,5) independent of species composition and latitude(6,7); specialist species, with only few mutualistic links, tend to interact with a proper subset of the many mutualistic partners of any of the generalist species(1). Despite sustained efforts(5,8-10) to explain observed network structure on the basis of community-level stability or persistence, such correlative studies have reached minimal consensus(11-13). Here we show that nested interaction networks could emerge as a consequence of an optimization principle aimed at maximizing the species abundance in mutualistic communities. Using analytical and numerical approaches, we show that because of the mutualistic interactions, an increase in abundance of a given species results in a corresponding increase in the total number of individuals in the community, and also an increase in the nestedness of the interaction matrix. Indeed, the species abundances and the nestedness of the interaction matrix are correlated by a factor that depends on the strength of the mutualistic interactions. Nestedness and the observed spontaneous emergence of generalist and specialist species occur for several dynamical implementations of the variational principle under stationary conditions. Optimized networks, although remaining stable, tend to be less resilient than their counterparts with randomly assigned interactions. In particular, we show analytically that the abundance of the rarest species is linked directly to the resilience of the community. Our work provides a unifying framework for studying the emergent structural and dynamical properties of ecological mutualistic networks(2,5,10,14).","Suweis, Samir; Simini, Filippo; Banavar, Jayanth R.; Maritan, Amos","Suweis, S; Simini, F; Banavar, JR; Maritan, A",449.0,"[Suweis, Samir; Maritan, Amos] Univ Padua, Ist Nazl Fis Nucl, Dipartimento Fis & Astron G Galilei, I-35131 Padua, Italy; [Suweis, Samir; Maritan, Amos] Univ Padua, Ist Nazl Fis Nucl, CNISM, I-35131 Padua, Italy; [Simini, Filippo] Northeastern Univ, Ctr Complex Network Res, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Simini, Filippo] Northeastern Univ, Dept Phys Biol & Comp Sci, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Simini, Filippo] Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Inst Phys, H-1111 Budapest, Hungary; [Banavar, Jayanth R.] Univ Maryland, Dept Phys, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12438,Article,,suweis@pd.infn.it; amos.maritan@pd.infn.it,452,Cariparo foundation,"A.M. and S.S. acknowledge the Cariparo foundation for financial support.

122,86,56.0,"Dietary restriction delays the incidence and decreases the growth of various types of tumours, but the mechanisms underlying the sensitivity of tumours to food restriction remain unknown. Here we show that certain human cancer cell lines, when grown as tumour xenografts in mice, are highly sensitive to the anti-growth effects of dietary restriction, whereas others are resistant. Cancer cells that form dietary-restriction-resistant tumours carry mutations that cause constitutive activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway and in culture proliferate in the absence of insulin or insulin-like growth factor 1. Substitution of an activated mutant allele of PI3K with wild-type PI3K in otherwise isogenic cancer cells, or the restoration of PTEN expression in a PTEN-null cancer cell line, is sufficient to convert a dietary-restriction-resistant tumour into one that is dietary-restriction-sensitive. Dietary restriction does not affect a PTEN-null mouse model of prostate cancer, but it significantly decreases tumour burden in a mouse model of lung cancer lacking constitutive PI3K signalling. Thus, the PI3K pathway is an important determinant of the sensitivity of tumours to dietary restriction, and activating mutations in the pathway may influence the response of cancers to dietary restriction-mimetic therapies.","Kalaany, Nada Y.; Sabatini, David M.","Kalaany, NY; Sabatini, DM",725.0,"[Kalaany, Nada Y.; Sabatini, David M.] Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Kalaany, Nada Y.; Sabatini, David M.] MIT, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Kalaany, Nada Y.; Sabatini, David M.] MIT, Koch Inst Integrat Canc Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Sabatini, David M.] Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07782,Article,,sabatini@wi.mit.edu,U61,"Alexander and Margaret Stewart Trust Award; David H.

123,128,297.0,"Phosphoinositide 3- kinases ( PI3Ks) signal downstream of multiple cell- surface receptor types. Class IA PI3K isoforms(1) couple to tyrosine kinases and consist of a p110 catalytic subunit ( p110 alpha, p110 beta or p110 delta), constitutively bound to one of five distinct p85 regulatory subunits. PI3Ks have been implicated in angiogenesis(2-5), but little is known about potential selectivity among the PI3K isoforms and their mechanism of action in endothelial cells during angiogenesis in vivo. Here we show that only p110 alpha activity is essential for vascular development. Ubiquitous or endothelial cell- specific inactivation of p110 alpha led to embryonic lethality at mid- gestation because of severe defects in angiogenic sprouting and vascular remodelling. p110 alpha exerts this critical endothelial cell- autonomous function by regulating endothelial cell migration through the small GTPase RhoA. p110 alpha activity is particularly high in endothelial cells and preferentially induced by tyrosine kinase ligands ( such as vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF)- A). In contrast, p110 delta in endothelial cells signals downstream of G- protein- coupled receptor ( GPCR) ligands such as SDF-1 alpha, whereas p110 delta is expressed at low level and contributes only minimally to PI3K activity in endothelial cells. These results provide the first in vivo evidence for p110- isoform","Graupera, Mariona; Guillermet-Guibert, Julie; Foukas, Lazaros C.; Phng, Li-Kun; Cain, Robert J.; Salpekar, Ashreena; Pearce, Wayne; Meek, Stephen; Millan, Jaime; Cutillas, Pedro R.; Smith, Andrew J.

124,105,309.0,"Haploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast cells use a prototypic cell signalling system to transmit information about the extracellular concentration of mating pheromone secreted by potential mating partners. The ability of cells to respond distinguishably to different pheromone concentrations depends on how much information about pheromone concentration the system can transmit. Here we show that the mitogen- activated protein kinase Fus3 mediates fast- acting negative feedback that adjusts the dose response of the downstream system response to match the dose response of receptor- ligand binding. This ` dose - response alignment', defined by a linear relationship between receptor occupancy and downstream response, can improve the fidelity of information transmission by making downstream responses corresponding to different receptor occupancies more distinguishable and reducing amplification of stochastic noise during signal transmission. We also show that one target of the feedback is a previously uncharacterized signal- promoting function of the regulator of G- protein signalling protein Sst2. Our work suggests that negative feedback is a general mechanism used in signalling systems to align dose responses and thereby increase the fidelity of information transmission.","Yu, Richard C.; Pesce, C.

125,320,396.0,"Ribosomes, the protein factories of living cells, translate genetic information carried by messenger RNAs into proteins, and are thus involved in virtually all aspects of cellular development and maintenance. The few available structures of the eukaryotic ribosome(1-6) reveal that it is more complex than its prokaryotic counterpart(7,8), owing mainly to the presence of eukaryote-specific ribosomal proteins and additional ribosomal RNA insertions, called expansion segments(9). The structures also differ among species, partly in the size and arrangement of these expansion segments. Such differences are extreme in kinetoplastids, unicellular eukaryotic parasites often infectious to humans. Here we present a high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of the ribosome of Trypanosoma brucei, the parasite that is transmitted by the tsetse fly and that causes African sleeping sickness. The atomic model reveals the unique features of this ribosome, characterized mainly by the presence of unusually large expansion segments and ribosomal-protein extensions leading to the formation of four additional inter-subunit bridges. We also find additional rRNA insertions, including one large rRNA domain that is not found in other eukaryotes. Furthermore, the structure reveals the five cleavage sites of the kinetoplastid large ribosomal subunit (LSU) rRNA chain, which is known to be cleaved uniquely into six pieces(10-12), and suggests that the cleavage is important for the maintenance of the T. brucei ribosome in the observed structure. We discuss several possible implications of the large rRNA expansion segments for the translation-regulation process. The structure could serve as a basis for future experiments aimed at understanding the functional importance of these kinetoplastid-specific ribosomal features in protein-translation regulation, an essential step towards finding effective and safe kinetoplastid-specific drugs.","Hashem, Yaser; Georges, Amedee des; Fu, Jie; Buss, Sarah N.; Jossinet, Fabrice; Jobe, Amy; Zhang, Qin; Liao, Hstau Y.; Grassucci, Robert A.; Bajaj, Chandrajit; Westhof, Eric; Madison-Antenucci, Susan; Frank, Joachim","Hashem, Y; Georges, AD; Fu, J; Buss, SN; Jossinet, F; Jobe, A; Zhang, Q; Liao, HY; Grassucci, RA; Bajaj, C; Westhof, E; Madison-Antenucci, S; Frank, J",385.0,"[Hashem, Yaser; Georges, Amedee des; Grassucci, Robert A.; Frank, Joachim] Columbia Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, Howard Hughes Med Inst HHMI, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Fu, Jie; Liao, Hstau Y.; Frank, Joachim] Columbia Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Buss, Sarah N.; Madison-Antenucci, Susan] New York State Dept Hlth, Div Infect Dis, Wadsworth Ctr, Albany, NY 12201 USA; [Jossinet, Fabrice; Westhof, Eric] Univ Strasbourg, Inst Biol Mol & Cellulaire CNRS, Architecture & Reactivite ARN, F-67084 Strasbourg, France; [Jobe, Amy; Frank, Joachim] Columbia Univ, Dept Biol Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Zhang, Qin; Bajaj, Chandrajit] Univ Texas Austin, Inst Computat Engn & Sci, Dept Comp Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11872,Article,1476-4687,jf2192@columbia.edu,389,"Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI); National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R01 GM29169]; L'Agence Nationale de la recherche (ANR) project AMIS ARN [ANR-09-BLAN-0160]; NIH [R01-EB004873, R01-GM074258]; Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Emerging Infectious Diseases (EID) fellowship program","This work is dedicated to the memory of Mariano Levin, who collaborated with J.F. and S.M.A. on the ribosomes from T. cruzi and T. brucei.

126,148,23.0,"Choanoflagellates are the closest known relatives of metazoans. To discover potential molecular mechanisms underlying the evolution of metazoan multicellularity, we sequenced and analysed the genome of the unicellular choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis. The genome contains approximately 9,200 intron- rich genes, including a number that encode cell adhesion and signalling protein domains that are otherwise restricted to metazoans. Here we show that the physical linkages among protein domains often differ between M. brevicollis and metazoans, suggesting that abundant domain shuffling followed the separation of the choanoflagellate and metazoan lineages. The completion of the M. brevicollis genome allows us to reconstruct with increasing resolution the genomic changes that accompanied the origin of metazoans.","King, Nicole; Westbrook, M.

127,283,213.0,"CAAX proteins have essential roles in multiple signalling pathways, controlling processes such as proliferation, differentiation and carcinogenesis(1). The similar to 120 mammalian CAAX proteins function at cellular membranes and include the Ras superfamily of small GTPases, nuclear lamins, the gamma-subunit of heterotrimeric GTPases, and several protein kinases and phosphatases(2). The proper localization of CAAX proteins to cell membranes is orchestrated by a series of post-translational modifications of the carboxy-terminal CAAX motifs(3) (where C is cysteine, A is an aliphatic amino acid and X is any amino acid). These reactions involve prenylation of the cysteine residue, cleavage at the AAX tripeptide and methylation of the carboxyl-prenylated cysteine residue. The major CAAX protease activity is mediated by Rce1 (Ras and a-factor converting enzyme 1), an intramembrane protease (IMP) of the endoplasmic reticulum(4,5). Information on the architecture and proteolytic mechanism of Rce1 has been lacking. Here we report the crystal structure of a Methano-coccus maripaludis homologue of Rce1, whose endopeptidase specificity for farnesylated peptides mimics that of eukaryotic Rce1. Its structure, comprising eight transmembrane alpha-helices, and catalytic site are distinct from those of other IMPs. The catalytic residues are located similar to 10 angstrom into the membrane and are exposed to the cytoplasm and membrane through a conical cavity that accommodates the prenylated CAAX substrate. We propose that the farnesyl lipid binds to a site at the opening of two transmembrane alpha-helices, which results in the scissile bond being positioned adjacent to a glutamate-activated nucleophilic water molecule. This study suggests that Rce1 is the founding member of a novel IMP family, the glutamate IMPs.","Manolaridis, Ioannis; Kulkarni, Kiran; Dodd, Roger B.; Ogasawara, Satoshi; Zhang, Ziguo; Bineva, Ganka; O'Reilly, Nicola; Hanrahan, Sarah J.; Thompson, Andrew J.; Cronin, Nora; Iwata, So; Barford, David","Manolaridis, I; Kulkarni, K; Dodd, RB; Ogasawara, S; Zhang, ZG; Bineva, G; O'Reilly, N; Hanrahan, SJ; Thompson, AJ; Cronin, N; Iwata, S; Barford, D",301.0,"[Manolaridis, Ioannis; Kulkarni, Kiran; Dodd, Roger B.; Zhang, Ziguo; Hanrahan, Sarah J.; Thompson, Andrew J.; Cronin, Nora; Barford, David] Inst Canc Res, London SW3 6JB, England; [Ogasawara, Satoshi; Iwata, So] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Ogasawara, Satoshi; Iwata, So] JST, Res Accelerat Program, Membrane Prot Crystallog Project, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Bineva, Ganka; O'Reilly, Nicola] Canc Res UK London Res Inst, London WC2A 3LY, England; [Iwata, So] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Life Sci, London SW7 2AZ, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12754,Article,1476-4687,dbarford@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk,+,Cancer Research UK; Japan Science and Technology agency; BBSRC [BB/G023425/1],"This work was funded by a Cancer Research UK grant to D.

128,427,340.0,"Enzymes catalysing the methylation of the 5-position of cytosine (mC) have essential roles in regulating gene expression and maintaining cellular identity. Recently, TET1 was found to hydroxylate the methyl group of mC, converting it to 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine (hmC). Here we show that TET1 binds throughout the genome of embryonic stem cells, with the majority of binding sites located at transcription start sites (TSSs) of CpG-rich promoters and within genes. The hmC modification is found in gene bodies and in contrast to mC is also enriched at CpG-rich TSSs. We provide evidence further that TET1 has a role in transcriptional repression. TET1 binds a significant proportion of Polycomb group target genes. Furthermore, TET1 associates and colocalizes with the SIN3A co-repressor complex. We propose that TET1 fine-tunes transcription, opposes aberrant DNA methylation at CpG-rich sequences and thereby contributes to the regulation of DNA methylation fidelity.","Williams, Kristine; Christensen, Jesper; Pedersen, Marianne Terndrup; Johansen, Jens V.; Cloos, Paul A.

129,431,402.0,"Understanding exotic forms of magnetism in quantum mechanical systems is a central goal of modern condensed matter physics, with implications for systems ranging from high-temperature superconductors to spintronic devices. Simulating magnetic materials in the vicinity of a quantum phase transition is computationally intractable on classical computers, owing to the extreme complexity arising from quantum entanglement between the constituent magnetic spins. Here we use a degenerate Bose gas of rubidium atoms confined in an optical lattice to simulate a chain of interacting quantum Ising spins as they undergo a phase transition. Strong spin interactions are achieved through a site-occupation to pseudo-spin mapping. As we vary a magnetic field, quantum fluctuations drive a phase transition from a paramagnetic phase into an antiferromagnetic phase. In the paramagnetic phase, the interaction between the spins is overwhelmed by the applied field, which aligns the spins. In the antiferromagnetic phase, the interaction dominates and produces staggered magnetic ordering. Magnetic domain formation is observed through both in situ site-resolved imaging and noise correlation measurements. By demonstrating a route to quantum magnetism in an optical lattice, this work should facilitate further investigations of magnetic models using ultracold atoms, thereby improving our understanding of real magnetic materials.","Simon, Jonathan; Bakr, Waseem S.; Ma, Ruichao; Tai, M.

130,319,387.0,"Sex pheromones play a pivotal role in the communication of many sexually reproducing organisms(1). Accordingly, speciation is often accompanied by pheromone diversification enabling proper mate finding and recognition(2). Current theory implies that chemical signals are under stabilizing selection by the receivers who thereby maintain the integrity of the signals(3). How the tremendous diversity of sex pheromones seen today evolved is poorly understood(4,5). Here we unravel the genetics of a newly evolved pheromone phenotype in wasps and present results from behavioural experiments indicating how the evolution of a new pheromone component occurred in an established sender-receiver system. We show that male Nasonia vitripennis evolved an additional pheromone compound differing only in its stereochemistry from a pre-existing one. Comparative behavioural studies show that conspecific females responded neutrally to the new pheromone phenotype when it evolved. Genetic mapping and gene knockdown show that a cluster of three closely linked genes accounts for the ability to produce this new pheromone phenotype. Our data suggest that new pheromone compounds can persist in a sender's population, without being selected against by the receiver and without the receiver having a pre-existing preference for the new pheromone phenotype, by initially remaining unperceived. Out results thus contribute valuable new insights into the evolutionary mechanisms underlying the diversification of sex pheromones: Furthermore, they indicate that the genetic basis of new pheromone compounds can be simple, allowing them to persist long enough in a population for receivers to evolve chemosensory adaptations for their exploitation.","Niehuis, Oliver; Buellesbach, Jan; Gibson, Joshua D.; Pothmann, Daniela; Hanner, Christian; Mutti, Navdeep S.; Judson, Andrea K.; Gadau, Juergen; Ruther, Joachim; Schmitt, Thomas","Niehuis, O; Buellesbach, J; Gibson, JD; Pothmann, D; Hanner, C; Mutti, NS; Judson, AK; Gadau, J; Ruther, J; Schmitt, T",345.0,"[Niehuis, Oliver] Zool Res Museum Alexander Koenig, Ctr Mol Biodivers Res, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Niehuis, Oliver; Buellesbach, Jan; Gibson, Joshua D.; Mutti, Navdeep S.; Judson, Andrea K.; Gadau, Juergen] Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Buellesbach, Jan; Hanner, Christian; Schmitt, Thomas] Univ Freiburg, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Buellesbach, Jan; Schmitt, Thomas] Univ Freiburg, Spemann Grad Sch Biol & Med, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Pothmann, Daniela; Ruther, Joachim] Univ Regensburg, Dept Zool, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany; [Mutti, Navdeep S.] DuPont Pioneer Agr Biotechnol, DuPont Expt Stn, Wilmington, DE 19880 USA; [Schmitt, Thomas] Tech Univ Darmstadt, Ecol Network Grp, D-64287 Darmstadt, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11838,Article,1476-4687,o.niehuis.zfmk@uni-bonn.de,348,Alexander von Humboldt foundation; Excellence Initiative of the German Research Foundation (Spemann Graduate School) [GSC-4]; German Research Foundation (DFG) [RU 717/10-1],"We thank J.

131,364,383.0,"Viruses must enter host cells to replicate, assemble and propagate. Because of the restricted size of their genomes, viruses have had to evolve efficient ways of exploiting host cell processes to promote their own life cycles and also to escape host immune defence mechanisms(1,2). Many viral open reading frames (viORFs) with immune-modulating functions essential for productive viral growth have been identified across a range of viral classes(3,4). However, there has been no comprehensive study to identify the host factors with which these viORFs interact for a global perspective of viral perturbation strategies(5-11). Here we show that different viral perturbation patterns of the host molecular defence network can be deduced from a mass-spectrometry-based host-factor survey in a defined human cellular system by using 70 innate immune-modulating viORFs from 30 viral species. The 579 host proteins targeted by the viORFs mapped to an unexpectedly large number of signalling pathways and cellular processes, suggesting yet unknown mechanisms of antiviral immunity.

132,301,73.0,"Major international projects are underway that are aimed at creating a comprehensive catalogue of all the genes responsible for the initiation and progression of cancer(1-9). These studies involve the sequencing of matched tumour-normal samples followed by mathematical analysis to identify those genes in which mutations occur more frequently than expected by random chance. Here we describe a fundamental problem with cancer genome studies: as the sample size increases, the list of putatively significant genes produced by current analytical methods burgeons into the hundreds. The list includes many implausible genes (such as those encoding olfactory receptors and the muscle protein titin), suggesting extensive false-positive findings that overshadow true driver events. We show that this problem stems largely from mutational heterogeneity and provide a novel analytical methodology, MutSigCV, for resolving the problem. We apply MutSigCV to exome sequences from 3,083 tumour-normal pairs and discover extraordinary variation in mutation frequency and spectrum within cancer types, which sheds light on mutational processes and disease aetiology, and in mutation frequency across the genome, which is strongly correlated with DNA replication timing and also with transcriptional activity. By incorporating mutational heterogeneity into the analyses, MutSigCV is able to eliminate most of the apparent artefactual findings and enable the identification of genes truly associated with cancer.","Lawrence, Michael S.; Stojanov, Petar; Polak, Paz; Kryukov, Gregory V.; Cibulskis, Kristian; Sivachenko, Andrey; Carter, Scott L.; Stewart, Chip; Mermel, Craig H.; Roberts, Steven A.; Kiezun, Adam; Hammerman, Peter S.; McKenna, Aaron; Drier, Yotam; Zou, Lihua; Ramos, Alex H.; Pugh, Trevor J.; Stransky, Nicolas; Helman, Elena; Kim, Jaegil; Sougnez, Carrie; Ambrogio, Lauren; Nickerson, Elizabeth; Shefler, Erica; Cortes, Maria L.; Auclair, Daniel; Saksena, Gordon; Voet, Douglas; Noble, Michael; DiCara, Daniel; Lin, Pei; Lichtenstein, Lee; Heiman, David I.; Fennell, Timothy; Imielinski, Marcin; Hernandez, Bryan; Hodis, Eran; Baca, Sylvan; Dulak, Austin M.; Lohr, Jens; Landau, Dan-Avi; Wu, Catherine J.; Melendez-Zajgla, Jorge; Hidalgo-Miranda, Alfredo; Koren, Amnon; McCarroll, Steven A.; Mora, Jaume; Lee, Ryan S.; Crompton, Brian; Onofrio, Robert; Parkin, Melissa; Winckler, Wendy; Ardlie, Kristin; Gabriel, Stacey B.; Roberts, Charles W.

133,324,441.0,"The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway regulates organismal growth in response to many environmental cues, including nutrients and growth factors(1). Cell-based studies showed that mTORC1 senses amino acids through the RagA-D family of GTPases(2,3) (also known as RRAGA, B, C and D), but their importance in mammalian physiology is unknown. Here we generate knock-in mice that express a constitutively active form of RagA (RagA(GTP)) from its endogenous promoter. RagA(GTP/GTP) mice develop normally, but fail to survive postnatal day 1. When delivered by Caesarean section, fasted RagA(GTP/GTP) neonates die almost twice as rapidly as wild-type littermates. Within an hour of birth, wild-type neonates strongly inhibit mTORC1, which coincides with profound hypoglycaemia and a decrease in plasma amino-acid concentrations. In contrast, mTORC1 inhibition does not occur in RagA(GTP/GTP) neonates, despite identical reductions in blood nutrient amounts. With prolonged fasting, wild-type neonates recover their plasma glucose concentrations, but RagA(GTP/GTP) mice remain hypoglycaemic until death, despite using glycogen at a faster rate. The glucose homeostasis defect correlates with the inability of fasted RagA(GTP/GTP) neonates to trigger autophagy and produce amino acids for de novo glucose production. Because profound hypoglycaemia does not inhibit mTORC1 inRagA(GTP/GTP) neonates, we considered the possibility that the Rag pathway signals glucose as well as amino-acid sufficiency to mTORC1. Indeed, mTORC1 is resistant to glucose deprivation in RagA(GTP/GTP) fibroblasts, and glucose, like amino acids, controls its recruitment to the lysosomal surface, the site of mTORC1 activation. Thus, the Rag GTPases signal glucose and amino-acid concentrations to mTORC1, and have an unexpectedly key role in neonates in autophagy induction and thus nutrient homeostasis and viability.","Efeyan, Alejo; Zoncu, Roberto; Chang, Steven; Gumper, Iwona; Snitkin, Harriet; Wolfson, Rachel L.; Kirak, Oktay; Sabatini, David D.; Sabatini, David M.","Efeyan, A; Zoncu, R; Chang, S; Gumper, I; Snitkin, H; Wolfson, RL; Kirak, O; Sabatini, DD; Sabatini, DM",679.0,"[Efeyan, Alejo; Zoncu, Roberto; Chang, Steven; Wolfson, Rachel L.; Kirak, Oktay; Sabatini, David M.] Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Efeyan, Alejo; Zoncu, Roberto; Chang, Steven; Wolfson, Rachel L.; Sabatini, David M.] Broad Inst Harvard & Massachusetts Inst Technol, Seven Cambridge Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Efeyan, Alejo; Zoncu, Roberto; Chang, Steven; Wolfson, Rachel L.; Sabatini, David M.] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Efeyan, Alejo; Zoncu, Roberto; Chang, Steven; Wolfson, Rachel L.; Sabatini, David M.] MIT, David H Koch Inst Integrat Canc Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Efeyan, Alejo; Zoncu, Roberto; Chang, Steven; Wolfson, Rachel L.; Sabatini, David M.] MIT, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Gumper, Iwona; Snitkin, Harriet; Sabatini, David D.] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, New York, NY 10016 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11745,Article,,sabatini@wi.mit.edu,+,"National Institutes of Health [R01 CA129105, R01 CA103866, R37 AI047389]; American Federation for Aging; Starr Foundation; Koch Institute Frontier Research Program; Ellison Medical Foundation; Human Frontiers Science Program; Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research; LAM Foundation","We thank members of the Sabatini laboratory for suggestions, and A.

134,429,395.0,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are essential components of the innate immune response against intracellular bacteria and it is thought that professional phagocytes generate ROS primarily via the phagosomal NADPH oxidase machinery(1). However, recent studies have suggested that mitochondrial ROS (mROS) also contribute to mouse macrophage bactericidal activity, although the mechanisms linking innate immune signalling to mitochondria for mROS generation remain unclear(2-4). Here we demonstrate that engagement of a subset of Toll-like receptors (TLR1, TLR2 and TLR4) results in the recruitment of mitochondria to macrophage phagosomes and augments mROS production. This response involves translocation of a TLR signalling adaptor, tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), to mitochondria, where it engages the protein ECSIT (evolutionarily conserved signalling intermediate in Toll pathways), which is implicated in mitochondrial respiratory chain assembly(5). Interaction with TRAF6 leads to ECSIT ubiquitination and enrichment at the mitochondrial periphery, resulting in increased mitochondrial and cellular ROS generation. ECSIT-and TRAF6-depleted macrophages have decreased levels of TLR-induced ROS and are significantly impaired in their ability to kill intracellular bacteria. Additionally, reducing macrophage mROS levels by expressing catalase in mitochondria results in defective bacterial killing, confirming the role of mROS in bactericidal activity. These results reveal a novel pathway linking innate immune signalling to mitochondria, implicate mROS as an important component of antibacterial responses and further establish mitochondria as hubs for innate immune signalling.","West, A.

135,92,156.0,"Understanding cortical circuits will require mapping the connections between specific populations of neurons(1), as well as determining the dendritic locations where the synapses occur(2). The dendrites of individual cortical neurons overlap with numerous types of local and long-range excitatory axons, but axodendritic overlap is not always a good predictor of actual connection strength(3-5). Here we developed an efficient channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)-assisted method(6-8) to map the spatial distribution of synaptic inputs, defined by presynaptic ChR2 expression, within the dendritic arborizations of recorded neurons. We expressed ChR2 in two thalamic nuclei, the whisker motor cortex and local excitatory neurons and mapped their synapses with pyramidal neurons in layers 3, 5A and 5B (L3, L5A and L5B) in the mouse barrel cortex. Within the dendritic arborizations of L3 cells, individual inputs impinged onto distinct single domains. These domains were arrayed in an orderly, monotonic pattern along the apical axis: axons from more central origins targeted progressively higher regions of the apical dendrites. In L5 arborizations, different inputs targeted separate basal and apical domains. Input to L3 and L5 dendrites in L1 was related to whisker movement and position, suggesting that these signals have a role in controlling the gain of their target neurons(9). Our experiments reveal high specificity in the subcellular organization of excitatory circuits.","Petreanu, Leopoldo; Mao, Tianyi; Sternson, Scott M.; Svoboda, Karel","Petreanu, L; Mao, TY; Sternson, SM; Svoboda, K",1142.0,"[Petreanu, Leopoldo; Mao, Tianyi; Sternson, Scott M.; Svoboda, Karel] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07709,Article,,svobodak@janelia.hhmi.org,U100,Howard Hughes Medical Institute,,411VI,Y,N,RAT BARREL CORTEX; PHASEOLUS-VULGARIS-LEUKOAGGLUTININ; PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; SYNAPTIC CONNECTIVITY; VISUAL-CORTEX; MOTOR CORTEX; DENDRITES; CIRCUIT; CHANNELRHODOPSIN-2; PROJECTIONS,7233.0,NATURE,Nature,English,34.0,No,"Mao, Tianyi/0000-0002-3532-8319; Petreanu, Leopoldo/0000-0003-1434-4691","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",26-Feb,5.0,LONDON,19151697.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2009.0,,"Svoboda, K (reprint author), Howard Hughes Med Inst, Janelia Farm Res Campus, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,382.0,The subcellular organization of neocortical excitatory connections,3.0,33.0,WOS:000263680100043,156.0,457,Multidisciplinary Sciences,384,karel,svoboda,40813.0,90,male,0.92,HTuwJ_EAAAAJ,5,"(17929, ]",22728486,1,1260483,1,Karel Svoboda,Karel Svoboda,1,1

The complete genome of the dominant bacterium, named 'Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera', was assembled. This apparently anaerobic, denitrifying bacterium encoded, transcribed and expressed the well-established aerobic pathway for methane oxidation, whereas it lacked known genes for dinitrogen production. Subsequent isotopic labelling indicated that 'M. oxyfera' bypassed the denitrification intermediate nitrous oxide by the conversion of two nitric oxidemolecules to dinitrogen and oxygen, which was used to oxidize methane. These results extend our understanding of hydrocarbon degradation under anoxic conditions and explain the biochemical mechanism of a poorly understood freshwater methane sink. Because nitrogen oxides were already present on early Earth, our finding opens up the possibility that oxygen was available to microbial metabolism before the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis.","Ettwig, Katharina F.; Butler, Margaret K.; Le Paslier, Denis; Pelletier, Eric; Mangenot, Sophie; Kuypers, Marcel M.

137,407,90.0,"Structural variation is widespread in mammalian genomes(1,2) and is an important cause of disease(3), but just how abundant and important structural variants (SVs) are in shaping phenotypic variation remains unclear(4,5). Without knowing how many SVs there are, and how they arise, it is difficult to discover what they do. Combining experimental with automated analyses, we identified 711,920 SVs at 281,243 sites in the genomes of thirteen classical and four wild-derived inbred mouse strains. The majority of SVs are less than 1 kilobase in size and 98% are deletions or insertions. The breakpoints of 160,000 SVs were mapped to base pair resolution, allowing us to infer that insertion of retrotransposons causes more than half of SVs. Yet, despite their prevalence, SVs are less likely than other sequence variants to cause gene expression or quantitative phenotypic variation. We identified 24 SVs that disrupt coding exons, acting as rare variants of large effect on gene function. One-third of the genes so affected have immunological functions.","Yalcin, Binnaz; Wong, Kim; Agam, Avigail; Goodson, Martin; Keane, Thomas M.; Gan, Xiangchao; Nellaker, Christoffer; Goodstadt, Leo; Nicod, Jerome; Bhomra, Amarjit; Hernandez-Pliego, Polinka; Whitley, Helen; Cleak, James; Dutton, Rebekah; Janowitz, Deborah; Mott, Richard; Adams, David J.; Flint, Jonathan","Yalcin, B; Wong, K; Agam, A; Goodson, M; Keane, TM; Gan, XC; Nellaker, C; Goodstadt, L; Nicod, J; Bhomra, A; Hernandez-Pliego, P; Whitley, H; Cleak, J; Dutton, R; Janowitz, D; Mott, R; Adams, DJ; Flint, J",326.0,"[Yalcin, Binnaz; Agam, Avigail; Goodson, Martin; Gan, Xiangchao; Goodstadt, Leo; Nicod, Jerome; Bhomra, Amarjit; Hernandez-Pliego, Polinka; Whitley, Helen; Cleak, James; Dutton, Rebekah; Janowitz, Deborah; Mott, Richard; Flint, Jonathan] Wellcome Trust Ctr Human Genet, Oxford OX3 7BN, England; [Wong, Kim; Keane, Thomas M.; Adams, David J.] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Cambridge CB10 1HH, England; [Agam, Avigail; Nellaker, Christoffer] Univ Oxford, Dept Physiol Anat & Genet, MRC Funct Genom Unit, Oxford OX1 3QX, England; [Janowitz, Deborah] Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Klinikum Hansestadt Stralsund, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, D-18437 Stralsund, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10432,Article,,da1@sanger.ac.uk; jf@well.ox.ac.uk,329,"Medical Research Council, UK; Wellcome Trust; Cancer Research UK","We thank A.

138,79,496.0,"With polar temperatures, similar to 3-5 degrees C warmer than today, the last interglacial stage (similar to 125 kyr ago) serves as a partial analogue for 1-2 degrees C global warming scenarios. Geological records from several sites indicate that local sea levels during the last interglacial were higher than today, but because local sea levels differ from global sea level, accurately reconstructing past global sea level requires an integrated analysis of globally distributed data sets. Here we present an extensive compilation of local sea level indicators and a statistical approach for estimating global sea level, local sea levels, ice sheet volumes and their associated uncertainties. We find a 95% probability that global sea level peaked at least 6.6 m higher than today during the last interglacial; it is likely (67% probability) to have exceeded 8.0 m but is unlikely (33% probability) to have exceeded 9.4 m. When global sea level was close to its current level (>=-10 m), the millennial average rate of global sea level rise is very likely to have exceeded 5.6 m kyr(-1) but is unlikely to have exceeded 9.2 m kyr(-1). Our analysis extends previous last interglacial sea level studies by integrating literature observations within a probabilistic framework that accounts for the physics of sea level change. The results highlight the long-term vulnerability of ice sheets to even relatively low levels of sustained global warming.","Kopp, Robert E.; Simons, Frederik J.; Mitrovica, Jerry X.; Maloof, Adam C.; Oppenheimer, Michael","Kopp, RE; Simons, FJ; Mitrovica, JX; Maloof, AC; Oppenheimer, M",863.0,"[Kopp, Robert E.; Simons, Frederik J.; Maloof, Adam C.; Oppenheimer, Michael] Princeton Univ, Dept Geosci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Kopp, Robert E.; Oppenheimer, Michael] Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Mitrovica, Jerry X.] Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08686,Article,1476-4687,rkopp@alumni.caltech.edu,U51,"Princeton Institute for Computational Science and Engineering; Princeton University Office of Information Technology; Science, Technology, and Environmental Policy","We thank J.

139,72,431.0,"Using next-generation sequencing technology alone, we have successfully generated and assembled a draft sequence of the giant panda genome. The assembled contigs (2.25 gigabases (Gb)) cover approximately 94% of the whole genome, and the remaining gaps (0.05 Gb) seem to contain carnivore-specific repeats and tandem repeats. Comparisons with the dog and human showed that the panda genome has a lower divergence rate. The assessment of panda genes potentially underlying some of its unique traits indicated that its bamboo diet might be more dependent on its gut microbiome than its own genetic composition. We also identified more than 2.7 million heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms in the diploid genome. Our data and analyses provide a foundation for promoting mammalian genetic research, and demonstrate the feasibility for using next-generation sequencing technologies for accurate, cost-effective and rapid de novo assembly of large eukaryotic genomes.","Li, Ruiqiang;

141,217,147.0,"Top-down prefrontal cortex inputs to the hippocampus have been hypothesized to be important in memory consolidation, retrieval, and the pathophysiology of major psychiatric diseases; however, no such direct projections have been identified and functionally described. Here we report the discovery of a monosynaptic prefrontal cortex (predominantly anterior cingulate) to hippocampus (CA3 to CA1 region) projection in mice, and find that optogenetic manipulation of this projection (here termed AC-CA) is capable of eliciting contextual memory retrieval. To explore the network mechanisms of this process, we developed and applied tools to observe cellular-resolution neural activity in the hippocampus while stimulating AC-CA projections during memory retrieval in mice behaving in virtual-reality environments. Using this approach, we found that learning drives the emergence of a sparse class of neurons in CA2/CA3 that are highly correlated with the local network and that lead synchronous population activity events; these neurons are then preferentially recruited by the AC-CA projection during memory retrieval. These findings reveal a sparsely implemented memory retrieval mechanism in the hippocampus that operates via direct top-down prefrontal input, with implications for the patterning and storage of salient memory representations.","Rajasethupathy, Priyamvada; Sankaran, Sethuraman; Marshel, James H.; Kim, Christina K.; Ferenczi, Emily; Lee, Soo Yeun; Berndt, Andre; Ramakrishnan, Charu; Jaffe, Anna; Lo, Maisie; Liston, Conor; Deisseroth, Karl","Rajasethupathy, P; Sankaran, S; Marshel, JH; Kim, CK; Ferenczi, E; Lee, SY; Berndt, A; Ramakrishnan, C; Jaffe, A; Lo, M; Liston, C; Deisseroth, K",653.0,"[Rajasethupathy, Priyamvada; Marshel, James H.; Kim, Christina K.; Ferenczi, Emily; Lee, Soo Yeun; Berndt, Andre; Ramakrishnan, Charu; Jaffe, Anna; Lo, Maisie; Liston, Conor; Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Dept Bioengn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Rajasethupathy, Priyamvada; Sankaran, Sethuraman; Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, CNC Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kim, Christina K.; Ferenczi, Emily; Lee, Soo Yeun; Berndt, Andre] Stanford Univ, Neurosci Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Liston, Conor; Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15389,Article,1476-4687,deissero@stanford.edu,659,"Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Neuro-FAST program; National Institute of Mental Health, National Science Foundation; National Institute on Drug Abuse, National Science Foundation; Simons Foundation; Tarlton Foundation; Wiegers Family Fund; Nancy and James Grosfeld Foundation; H.L.

Here we report the development of a versatile family of genetically encoded optical tools ('optoXRs') that leverage common structure -function relationships(1) among G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to recruit and control, with high spatiotemporal precision, receptor-initiated biochemical signalling pathways. In particular, we have developed and characterized two optoXRs that selectively recruit distinct, targeted signalling pathways in response to light. The two optoXRs exerted opposing effects on spike firing in nucleus accumbens in vivo, and precisely timed optoXR photostimulation in nucleus accumbens by itself sufficed to drive conditioned place preference in freely moving mice. The optoXR approach allows testing of hypotheses regarding the causal impact of biochemical signalling in behaving mammals, in a targetable and temporally precise manner.","Airan, Raag D.; Thompson, Kimberly R.; Fenno, Lief E.; Bernstein, Hannah; Deisseroth, Karl","Airan, RD; Thompson, KR; Fenno, LE; Bernstein, H; Deisseroth, K",1025.0,"[Airan, Raag D.; Thompson, Kimberly R.; Fenno, Lief E.; Bernstein, Hannah; Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Dept Bioengn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07926,Article,,deissero@stanford.edu,1029,NIH/NIMH National Research Service Award; Stanford Medical Scientist Training Program; NARSAD Young Investigator Award; CIRM; McKnight; Coulter; Klingenstein; Keck; NSF; NIDA; NIH Pioneer Award; Albert Yu and Mary Bechmann Foundation; Kinetics Foundation,"We thank B.

143,188,3.0,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy remains an untreatable genetic disease that severely limits motility and life expectancy in affected children. The only animal model specifically reproducing the alterations in the dystrophin gene and the full spectrum of human pathology is the golden retriever dog model. Affected animals present a single mutation in intron 6, resulting in complete absence of the dystrophin protein, and early and severe muscle degeneration with nearly complete loss of motility and walking ability. Death usually occurs at about 1 year of age as a result of failure of respiratory muscles. Here we report that intra-arterial delivery of wild-type canine mesoangioblasts (vessel-associated stem cells) results in an extensive recovery of dystrophin expression, normal muscle morphology and function ( confirmed by measurement of contraction force on single fibres). The outcome is a remarkable clinical amelioration and preservation of active motility. These data qualify mesoangioblasts as candidates for future stem cell therapy for Duchenne patients.","Sampaolesi, Maurilio; Blot, Stephane; D'Antona, Giuseppe; Granger, Nicolas; Tonlorenzi, Rossana; Innocenzi, Anna; Mognol, Paolo; Thibaud, Jean-Laurent; Galvez, Beatriz G.; Barthelemy, Ines; Perani, Laura; Mantero, Sara; Guttinger, Maria; Pansarasa, Orietta; Rinaldi, Chiara; De Angelis, M.

144,419,242.0,"Many globular and natively disordered proteins can convert into amyloid fibrils. These fibrils are associated with numerous pathologies(1) as well as with normal cellular functions(2,3), and frequently form during protein denaturation(4,5). Inhibitors of pathological amyloid fibril formation could be useful in the development of therapeutics, provided that the inhibitors were specific enough to avoid interfering with normal processes. Here we show that computer-aided, structure-based design can yield highly specific peptide inhibitors of amyloid formation. Using known atomic structures of segments of amyloid fibrils as templates, we have designed and characterized an all-D-amino-acid inhibitor of the fibril formation of the tau protein associated with Alzheimer's disease, and a non-natural L.-amino-acid inhibitor of an amyloid fibril that enhances sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus. Our results indicate that peptides from structure-based designs can disrupt the fibril formation of full-length proteins, including those, such as tau protein, that lack fully ordered native structures. Because the inhibiting peptides have been designed on structures of dual-beta-sheet 'steric zippers', the successful inhibition of amyloid fibril formation strengthens the hypothesis that amyloid spines contain steric zippers.","Sievers, Stuart A.; Karanicolas, John; Chang, Howard W.; Zhao, Anni; Jiang, Lin; Zirafi, Onofrio; Stevens, Jason T.; Muench, Jan; Baker, David; Eisenberg, David","Sievers, SA; Karanicolas, J; Chang, HW; Zhao, A; Jiang, L; Zirafi, O; Stevens, JT; Munch, J; Baker, D; Eisenberg, D",96.0,"[Sievers, Stuart A.; Chang, Howard W.; Zhao, Anni; Jiang, Lin; Eisenberg, David] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biol Chem, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Sievers, Stuart A.; Chang, Howard W.; Zhao, Anni; Jiang, Lin; Eisenberg, David] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Chem & Biochem, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Karanicolas, John; Baker, David] Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Karanicolas, John; Baker, David] Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Karanicolas, John; Stevens, Jason T.] Univ Kansas, Ctr Bioinformat, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Karanicolas, John; Stevens, Jason T.] Univ Kansas, Dept Mol Biosci, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Zirafi, Onofrio; Muench, Jan] Univ Hosp Ulm, Inst Mol Virol, D-89081 Ulm, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10154,Article,,david@mbi.ucla.edu,U117,"Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation; Ruth L.

145,318,385.0,"Recent studies suggest that electrides-ionic crystals in which electrons serve as anions-are not exceptional materials but rather a generalized form, particularly under high pressure(1-3). The topology of the cavities confining anionic electrons determines their physical.properties(4). At present, reported confining sites consist only of zero-dimensional cavities or weakly linked channels(4). Here we report a layered-structure electride of dicalcium nitride, Ca2N, which possesses two-dimensionally confined anionic electrons whose concentration agrees well with that for the chemical formula of [Ca2N](+).e(-). Two-dimensional transport characteristics are demonstrated by a high electron mobility (520 cm(2) V-1 s(-1)) and long mean scattering time (0.6 picoseconds) with a mean free path of 0.12 micrometres. The quadratic temperature dependence of the resistivity up to 120 Kelvin indicates the presence of an electron-electron interaction. A striking anisotropic magnetoresistance behaviour with respect to the direction of magnetic field (negative for the field perpendicular to the conducting plane and positive for the field parallel to it) is observed, confirming diffusive two-dimensional transport in dense electron layers. Additionally, band calculations support confinement of anionic electrons within the interlayer space, and photoemission measurements confirm anisotropic low work functions of 3.5 and 2.6 electronvolts, revealing the loosely bound nature of the anionic electrons. We conclude that Ca2N is a two-dimensional electride in terms of [Ca2N](+).e(-).","Lee, Kimoon; Kim, Sung Wng; Toda, Yoshitake; Matsuishi, Satoru; Hosono, Hideo","Lee, K; Kim, SW; Toda, Y; Matsuishi, S; Hosono, H",336.0,"[Lee, Kimoon; Kim, Sung Wng; Toda, Yoshitake; Hosono, Hideo] Tokyo Inst Technol, Frontier Res Ctr, Midori Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2268503, Japan; [Kim, Sung Wng] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Energy Sci, Suwon 440746, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Matsuishi, Satoru; Hosono, Hideo] Tokyo Inst Technol, Mat & Struct Lab, Midori Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2268503, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11812,Article,1476-4687,hosono@msl.titech.ac.jp,340,"Funding Program for World-Leading Innovative R&D On Science and Technology (FIRST); JSPS; Element Strategy Initiative Project, MEXT, Japan","This work was supported by the Funding Program for World-Leading Innovative R&D On Science and Technology (FIRST), JSPS, and the Element Strategy Initiative Project, MEXT, Japan.",095CS,,,TEMPERATURE STABLE ELECTRIDE; ROOM-TEMPERATURE; WORK FUNCTION; ALUMINUM; SURFACE; CA2N,7437.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,"Hosono, Hideo/0000-0001-9260-6728","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",21-Feb,5.0,LONDON,23364689.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2013.0,"Kim, Sung Wng/A-4747-2013; Hosono, Hideo/J-3489-2013","Hosono, H (reprint author), Tokyo Inst Technol, Frontier Res Ctr, Midori Ku, 4259 Nagatsuta, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2268503, Japan.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,74.0,Dicalcium nitride as a two-dimensional electride with an anionic electron layer,18.0,242.0,WOS:000315312900034,385.0,494,Multidisciplinary Sciences,75,hideo,hosono,80092.0,8,male,1.0,0Uon_c8AAAAJ,5,"(17929, ]",38482827,1,38482827,1,Hideo Hosono,Hideo Hosono,1,1
146,9,163.0,"The multi-component mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) kinase is the central node of a mammalian pathway that coordinates cell growth with the availability of nutrients, energy and growth factors(1). Progress has been made in the identification of mTORC1 pathway components and in understanding their functions in cells, but there is relatively little known about the role of the pathway in vivo. Specifically, we have little knowledge regarding the role mTOCR1 has in liver physiology. In fasted animals, the liver performs numerous functions that maintain whole-body homeostasis, including the production of ketone bodies for peripheral tissues to use as energy sources. Here we show that mTORC1 controls ketogenesis in mice in response to fasting. We find that liver-specific loss of TSC1 (tuberous sclerosis 1), an mTORC1 inhibitor(1), leads to a fasting-resistant increase in liver size, and to a pronounced defect in ketone body production and ketogenic gene expression on fasting. The loss of raptor (regulatory associated protein of mTOR, complex 1) an essential mTORC1 component(1), has the opposite effects. In addition, we find that the inhibition of mTORC1 is required for the fasting-induced activation of PPAR alpha (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha), the master transcriptional activator of ketogenic genes(2), and that suppression of NCoR1 (nuclear receptor co-repressor 1), a co-repressor of PPAR alpha(3), reactivates ketogenesis in cells and livers with hyperactive mTORC1 signalling. Like livers with activated mTORC1, livers from aged mice have a defect in ketogenesis(4,5), which correlates with an increase in mTORC1 signalling. Moreover, we show that the suppressive effects of mTORC1 activation and ageing on PPAR alpha activity and ketone production are not additive, and that mTORC1 inhibition is sufficient to prevent the ageing-induced defect in ketogenesis. Thus, our findings reveal that mTORC1 is a key regulator of PPAR alpha function and hepatic ketogenesis and suggest a role for mTORC1 activity in promoting the ageing of the liver.","Sengupta, Shomit; Peterson, Timothy R.; Laplante, Mathieu; Oh, Stephanie; Sabatini, David M.","Sengupta, S; Peterson, TR; Laplante, M; Oh, S; Sabatini, DM",1100.0,"[Sengupta, Shomit; Peterson, Timothy R.; Laplante, Mathieu; Oh, Stephanie; Sabatini, David M.] Nine Cambridge Ctr, Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Sengupta, Shomit; Peterson, Timothy R.; Laplante, Mathieu; Oh, Stephanie; Sabatini, David M.] MIT, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Sengupta, Shomit; Peterson, Timothy R.; Laplante, Mathieu; Oh, Stephanie; Sabatini, David M.] MIT, David H Koch Inst Integrat Canc Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09584,Article,,sabatini@wi.mit.edu,U502,"American Diabetes Association; Ludwig Cancer Fund; Canadian Institutes of Health Research; NIH [CA103866, CA129105]","We thank S.

147,38,115.0,"The three-dimensional structures of proteins often show a modular architecture comprised of discrete structural regions or domains. Cooperative communication between these regions is important for catalysis, regulation and efficient folding; lack of coupling has been implicated in the formation of fibrils and other misfolding pathologies(1). How different structural regions of a protein communicate and contribute to a protein's overall energetics and folding, however, is still poorly understood. Here we use a single-molecule optical tweezers approach to induce the selective unfolding of particular regions of T4 lysozyme and monitor the effect on other regions not directly acted on by force. We investigate how the topological organization of a protein (the order of structural elements along the sequence) affects the coupling and folding cooperativity between its domains. To probe the status of the regions not directly subjected to force, we determine the free energy changes during mechanical unfolding using Crooks' fluctuation theorem. We pull on topological variants (circular permutants) and find that the topological organization of the polypeptide chain critically determines the folding cooperativity between domains and thus what parts of the folding/unfolding landscape are explored. We speculate that proteins may have evolved to select certain topologies that increase coupling between regions to avoid areas of the landscape that lead to kinetic trapping and misfolding.","Shank, Elizabeth A.; Cecconi, Ciro; Dill, Jesse W.; Marqusee, Susan; Bustamante, Carlos","Shank, EA; Cecconi, C; Dill, JW; Marqusee, S; Bustamante, C",637.0,"[Shank, Elizabeth A.; Cecconi, Ciro; Marqusee, Susan; Bustamante, Carlos] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Shank, Elizabeth A.; Cecconi, Ciro; Dill, Jesse W.; Marqusee, Susan; Bustamante, Carlos] Univ Calif Berkeley, Inst Quantitat Biosci, Jason L Choy Lab Single Mol Biophys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Dill, Jesse W.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Biophys Grad Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Bustamante, Carlos] Univ Calif Berkeley, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Bustamante, Carlos] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Bustamante, Carlos] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09021,Article,,Marqusee@berkeley.edu; Carlos@alice.berkeley.edu,U134,"NIH [GM 32543, GM 50945]; NSF","We would like to thank G.

To carry out analysis on gut microbial content in patients with type 2 diabetes, we developed a protocol for a metagenome-wide association study (MGWAS) and undertook a two-stage MGWAS based on deep shotgun sequencing of the gut microbial DNA from 345 Chinese individuals. We identified and validated approximately 60,000 type-2-diabetes-associated markers and established the concept of a metagenomic linkage group, enabling taxonomic species-level analyses. MGWAS analysis showed that patients with type 2 diabetes were characterized by a moderate degree of gut microbial dysbiosis, a decrease in the abundance of some universal butyrate-producing bacteria and an increase in various opportunistic pathogens, as well as an enrichment of other microbial functions conferring sulphate reduction and oxidative stress resistance. An analysis of 23 additional individuals demonstrated that these gut microbial markers might be useful for classifying type 2 diabetes.","Qin, Junjie; Li, Yingrui; Cai, Zhiming; Li, Shenghui; Zhu, Jianfeng; Zhang, Fan; Liang, Suisha; Zhang, Wenwei; Guan, Yuanlin; Shen, Dongqian; Peng, Yangqing; Zhang, Dongya; Jie, Zhuye; Wu, Wenxian; Qin, Youwen; Xue, Wenbin; Li, Junhua; Han, Lingchuan; Lu, Donghui; Wu, Peixian; Dai, Yali; Sun, Xiaojuan; Li, Zesong; Tang, Aifa; Zhong, Shilong; Li, Xiaoping; Chen, Weineng; Xu, Ran; Wang, Mingbang; Feng, Qiang; Gong, Meihua; Yu, Jing; Zhang, Yanyan; Zhang, Ming; Hansen, Torben; Sanchez, Gaston; Raes, Jeroen; Falony, Gwen; Okuda, Shujiro; Almeida, Mathieu; LeChatelier, Emmanuelle; Renault, Pierre; Pons, Nicolas; Batto, Jean-Michel; Zhang, Zhaoxi; Chen, Hua; Yang, Ruifu; Zheng, Weimou; Li, Songgang; Yang, Huanming; Wang, Jian; Ehrlich, S.

149,131,330.0,"Metabolic phenotypes are the products of interactions among a variety of factors-dietary, other lifestyle/environmental, gut microbial and genetic(1-3). We use a large-scale exploratory analytical approach to investigate metabolic phenotype variation across and within four human populations, based on H-1 NMR spectroscopy. Metabolites discriminating across populations are then linked to data for individuals on blood pressure, a major risk factor for coronary heart disease and stroke (leading causes of mortality worldwide(4)). We analyse spectra from two 24-hour urine specimens for each of 4,630 participants from the INTERMAP epidemiological study(5), involving 17 population samples aged 40-59 in China, Japan, UK and USA. We show that urinary metabolite excretion patterns for East Asian and western population samples, with contrasting diets, diet-related major risk factors, and coronary heart disease/stroke rates, are significantly differentiated (P < 10(-16)), as are Chinese/Japanese metabolic phenotypes, and subgroups with differences in dietary vegetable/animal protein and blood pressure(6). Among discriminatory metabolites, we quantify four and show association (P < 0.05 to P < 0.0001) of mean 24-hour urinary formate excretion with blood pressure in multiple regression analyses for individuals. Mean 24-hour urinary excretion of alanine (direct) and hippurate (inverse), reflecting diet and gut microbial activities(2,7), are also associated with blood pressure of individuals. Metabolic phenotyping applied to high-quality epidemiological data offers the potential to develop an area of aetiopathogenetic knowledge involving discovery of novel biomarkers related to cardiovascular disease risk.","Holmes, Elaine; Loo, Ruey Leng; Stamler, Jeremiah; Bictash, Magda; Yap, Ivan K.

150,67,373.0,"Although the notion of an early origin and diversification of life on Earth during the Archaean eon has received increasing support in geochemical, sedimentological and palaeontological evidence, ambiguities and controversies persist regarding the biogenicity and syngeneity of the record older than Late Archaean(1-3). Non-biological processes are known to produce morphologies similar to some microfossils(4,5), and hydrothermal fluids have the potential to produce abiotic organic compounds with depleted carbon isotope values(6), making it difficult to establish unambiguous traces of life. Here we report the discovery of a population of large (up to about 300 mu m in diameter) carbonaceous spheroidal microstructures in Mesoarchaean shales and siltstones of the Moodies Group, South Africa, the Earth's oldest siliciclastic alluvial to tidal-estuarine deposits(7). These microstructures are interpreted as organic-walled microfossils on the basis of petrographic and geochemical evidence for their endogenicity and syngeneity, their carbonaceous composition, cellular morphology and ultrastructure, occurrence in populations, taphonomic features of soft wall deformation, and the geological context plausible for life, as well as a lack of abiotic explanation falsifying a biological origin. These are the oldest and largest Archaean organic-walled spheroidal microfossils reported so far. Our observations suggest that relatively large microorganisms cohabited with earlier reported benthic microbial mats(8) in the photic zone of marginal marine siliciclastic environments 3.2 billion years ago.","Javaux, Emmanuelle J.; Marshall, Craig P.; Bekker, Andrey","Javaux, EJ; Marshall, CP; Bekker, A",934.0,"[Javaux, Emmanuelle J.] Univ Liege, Dept Geol, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; [Marshall, Craig P.] Univ Kansas, Dept Geol, Lawrence, KS 66044 USA; [Bekker, Andrey] Univ Manitoba, Dept Geol Sci, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08793,Article,,ej.javaux@ulg.ac.be,U108,University of Liege Impulsion [CFRA0805]; University of Liege [RCFRA0036-J]; National Science Foundation [EAR-937 05-45484]; NASA Astrobiology Institute [NNA04CC09A]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Australian Research Council,"We thank M.

151,245,177.0,"As modern humans migrated out of Africa, they encountered many new environmental conditions, including greater temperature extremes, different pathogens and higher altitudes. These diverse environments are likely to have acted as agents of natural selection and to have led to local adaptations. One of the most celebrated examples in humans is the adaptation of Tibetans to the hypoxic environment of the high-altitude Tibetan plateau(1-3). A hypoxia pathway gene, EPAS1, was previously identified as having the most extreme signature of positive selection in Tibetans(4-10), and was shown to be associated with differences in haemoglobin concentration at high altitude. Re-sequencing the region around EPAS1 in 40 Tibetan and 40 Han individuals, we find that this gene has a highly unusual haplotype structure that can only be convincingly explained by introgression of DNA from Denisovan or Denisovan-related individuals into humans. Scanning a larger set of worldwide populations, we find that the selected haplotype is only found in Denisovans and in Tibetans, and at very low frequency among Han Chinese. Furthermore, the length of the haplotype, and the fact that it is not found in any other populations, makes it unlikely that the haplotype sharing between Tibetans and Denisovans was caused by incomplete ancestral lineage sorting rather than introgression. Our findings illustrate that admixture with other hominin species has provided genetic variation that helped humans to adapt to new environments.","Huerta-Sanchez, Emilia; Jin, Xin; Asan; Bianba, Zhuoma; Peter, Benjamin M.; Vinckenbosch, Nicolas; Liang, Yu; Yi, Xin; He, Mingze; Somel, Mehmet; Ni, Peixiang; Wang, Bo; Ou, Xiaohua; Huasang; Luosang, Jiangbai; Cuo, Zha Xi Ping; Li, Kui; Gao, Guoyi; Yin, Ye; Wang, Wei; Zhang, Xiuqing; Xu, Xun; Yang, Huanming; Li, Yingrui; Wang, Jian; Wang, Jun; Nielsen, Rasmus","Huerta-Sanchez, E; Jin, X; Asan; Bianba, Z; Peter, BM; Vinckenbosch, N; Liang, Y; Yi, X; He, MZ; Somel, M; Ni, PX; Wang, B; Ou, XH; Huasang; Luosang, JB; Cuo, ZXP; Li, K; Gao, GY; Yin, Y; Wang, W; Zhang, XQ; Xu, X; Yang, HM; Li, YR; Wang, J; Wang, J; Nielsen, R",194.0,"[Huerta-Sanchez, Emilia; Jin, Xin; Asan; Liang, Yu; Yi, Xin; He, Mingze; Somel, Mehmet; Ni, Peixiang; Wang, Bo; Ou, Xiaohua; Huasang; Luosang, Jiangbai; Yin, Ye; Wang, Wei; Zhang, Xiuqing; Xu, Xun; Yang, Huanming; Li, Yingrui; Wang, Jian; Wang, Jun; Nielsen, Rasmus] BGI Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, Peoples R China; [Huerta-Sanchez, Emilia; Peter, Benjamin M.; Vinckenbosch, Nicolas; Nielsen, Rasmus] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Huerta-Sanchez, Emilia] Univ Calif, Sch Nat Sci, Merced, CA 95343 USA; [Jin, Xin] S China Univ Technol, Sch Biosci & Bioengn, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Asan; Liang, Yu; Yi, Xin] BGI Tianjin, Binhai Genom Inst, Tianjin 300308, Peoples R China; [Asan; Liang, Yu; Yi, Xin] BGI Tianjin, Tianjin Translat Genom Ctr, Tianjin 300308, Peoples R China; [Bianba, Zhuoma] Peoples Hosp Lhasa, Lhasa 850000, Peoples R China; [He, Mingze] Iowa State Univ, Bioinformat & Computat Biol Program, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Somel, Mehmet] Middle E Tech Univ, Dept Biol Sci, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey; [Cuo, Zha Xi Ping] Second Peoples Hosp Tibet Autonomous Reg, Lhasa 850000, Peoples R China; [Li, Kui] Peoples Hosp Tibet Autonomous Reg, Lhasa 850000, Peoples R China; [Gao, Guoyi] Hosp XiShuangBanNa Dai Nationalities, Autonomous Jinghong 666100, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiuqing] BGI Shenzhen, Guangdong Enterprise Key Lab Human Dis Genom, Shenzhen 518083, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiuqing] BGI Shenzhen, Shenzhen Key Lab Trans Biotechnol, Shenzhen 518083, Peoples R China; [Yang, Huanming; Wang, Jun] King Abdulaziz Univ, Princess Al Jawhara Ctr Excellence Res Hereditary, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia; [Yang, Huanming; Wang, Jian] James D Watson Inst Genome Sci, Hangzhou 310008, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jun; Nielsen, Rasmus] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Wang, Jun] Macau Univ Sci & Technol, Taipa 999078, Macau, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jun] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Med, Hong Kong 999077, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Nielsen, Rasmus] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Stat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13408,Article,1476-4687,wangjian@genomics.cn; wangj@genomics.cn; rasmus_nielsen@berkeley.edu,+,"973 Program [2011CB809203, 2012CB518201, 2011CB809201, 2011CB809202]; State Key Development Program for Basic Research of China; China National GeneBank-Shenzhen; Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Transomics Biotechnologies [CXB201108250096A]; US NIH [R01HG003229, R01HG003229-08S2]","This research was funded by the State Key Development Program for Basic Research of China, 973 Program (2011CB809203, 2012CB518201, 2011CB809201, 2011CB809202), China National GeneBank-Shenzhen and Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Transomics Biotechnologies (no.

152,279,153.0,"Galaxies observed at redshift z>6, when the Universe was less than a billion years old, thus far very rarely show evidence(1-3) of the cold dust that accompanies star formation in the local Universe, where the dust-to-gas mass ratio is around one per cent. A prototypical example is the galaxy Himiko (z = 6.6), which-a mere 840 million years after the Big Bang-is forming stars at a rate of 30-100 solar masses per year, yielding a mass assembly time of about 150 x 10(6) years. Himiko is thought to have a low fraction (2-3 per cent of the Sun's) of elements heavier than helium (low metallicity), and although its gas mass cannot yet be determined its dust-to-stellar mass ratio is constrained(3) to be less than 0.05 per cent. The local dwarf galaxy I Zwicky 18, which has a metallicity about 4 per cent that of the Sun's(4) and is forming stars less rapidly (assembly time about 1.6 x 10(9) years) than Himiko but still vigorously for its mass(5), is also very dust deficient and is perhaps one of the best analogues of primitive galaxies accessible to detailed study. Here we report observations of dust emission from I Zw 18, from which we determine its dust mass to be 450-1,800 solar masses, yielding a dust-to-stellar mass ratio of about 10(-6) to 10(-5) and a dust-to-gas mass ratio of 3.2-13 x 10(-6). If I Zw 18 is a reasonable analogue of Himiko, then Himiko's dust mass must be around 50,000 solar masses, a factor of 100 below the current upper limit. These numbers are quite uncertain, but if most high-z galaxies are more like Himiko than like the very-high-dust-mass galaxy SDSS J114816.64 + 525150.3 at z approximate to 6, which hosts a quasar(6), then our prospects for detecting the gas and dust inside such galaxies are much poorer than hitherto anticipated.","Fisher, David B.; Bolatto, Alberto D.; Herrera-Camus, Rodrigo; Draine, Bruce T.; Donaldson, Jessica; Walter, Fabian; Sandstrom, Karin M.; Leroy, Adam K.; Cannon, John; Gordon, Karl","Fisher, DB; Bolatto, AD; Herrera-Camus, R; Draine, BT; Donaldson, J; Walter, F; Sandstrom, KM; Leroy, AK; Cannon, J; Gordon, K",186.0,"[Fisher, David B.; Bolatto, Alberto D.; Herrera-Camus, Rodrigo; Donaldson, Jessica] Univ Maryland, Dept Astron, Lab Millimeter Wave Astron, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Fisher, David B.; Bolatto, Alberto D.; Herrera-Camus, Rodrigo; Donaldson, Jessica] Univ Maryland, Joint Space Inst, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Fisher, David B.] Swinburne Univ Technol, Ctr Astrophys & Supercomp, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia; [Draine, Bruce T.] Princeton Univ, Dept Astrophys Sci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Walter, Fabian; Sandstrom, Karin M.] Max Planck Inst Astron, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Leroy, Adam K.] Natl Radio Astron Observ, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Cannon, John] Macalester Coll, Dept Phys & Astron, St Paul, MN 55105 USA; [Gordon, Karl] Space Telescope Sci Inst, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12765,Article,1476-4687,dfisher@swin.edu.au; bolatto@astro.umd.edu,189,"University of Maryland; Laboratory for Millimeter Astronomy; NSF [AST0838178, AST1008570, AST1211683]; CAREER NSF [AST0955836, AST1139998]; Research Corporation for Science Advancement Cottrell Scholar award; Marie Curie International Incoming fellowship; BMVIT (Austria); ESA-PRODEX (Belgium); CEA/CNES (France); DLR (Germany); ASI/INAF (Italy); CICYT/MCYT (Spain)","D.B.F., A.
