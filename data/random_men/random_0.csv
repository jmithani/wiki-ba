0,97,185.0,"Most herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) reactivations in humans are subclinical and associated with rapid expansion and containment of virus. Previous studies have shown that CD8(+) T cells persist in genital skin and mucosa at the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ)-the portal of neuronal release of reactivating virus-for prolonged time periods after herpes lesions are cleared(1,2). The phenotype and function of this persistent CD8(+) T-cell population remain unknown. Here, using cell-type-specific laser capture microdissection, transcriptional profiling and T-cell antigen receptor beta-chain (TCR beta) genotyping on sequential genital skin biopsies, we show that CD8 alpha alpha(+) T cells are the dominant resident population of DEJ CD8(+) T cells that persist at the site of previous HSV-2 reactivation. CD8 alpha alpha(+) T cells located at the DEJ lack chemokine-receptor expression required for lymphocyte egress and recirculation, express gene signatures of T-cell activation and antiviral activity, and produce cytolytic granules during clinical and virological quiescent time periods. Sequencing of the TCR beta-chain repertoire reveals that the DEJ CD8 alpha alpha(+) T cells are oligoclonal with diverse usage of TCR variable-beta genes, which differ from those commonly described for mucosa-associated invariant T cells and natural killer T cells. Dominant clonotypes are shown to overlap among multiple recurrences over a period of two-and-a-half years. Episodes of rapid asymptomatic HSV-2 containment were also associated with a high CD8 effector-to-target ratio and focal enrichment of CD8 alpha alpha(+) T cells. These studies indicate that DEJ CD8 alpha alpha(+) T cells are tissue-resident cells that seem to have a fundamental role in immune surveillance and in initial containment of HSV-2 reactivation in human peripheral tissue. Elicitation of CD8 alpha alpha(+) T cells may be a critical component for developing effective vaccines against skin and mucosal infections.","Zhu, Jia; Peng, Tao; Johnston, Christine; Phasouk, Khamsone; Kask, Angela S.; Klock, Alexis; Jin, Lei; Diem, Kurt; Koelle, David M.; Wald, Anna; Robins, Harlan; Corey, Lawrence","Zhu, J; Peng, T; Johnston, C; Phasouk, K; Kask, AS; Klock, A; Jin, L; Diem, K; Koelle, DM; Wald, A; Robins, H; Corey, L",494.0,"[Zhu, Jia; Kask, Angela S.; Klock, Alexis; Jin, Lei; Diem, Kurt; Koelle, David M.; Wald, Anna; Corey, Lawrence] Univ Washington, Dept Lab Med, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Zhu, Jia; Peng, Tao; Phasouk, Khamsone; Koelle, David M.; Wald, Anna; Corey, Lawrence] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Vaccine & Infect Dis Div, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Peng, Tao; Johnston, Christine; Koelle, David M.; Wald, Anna; Corey, Lawrence] Univ Washington, Dept Med, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Koelle, David M.; Corey, Lawrence] Univ Washington, Dept Pathobiol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Koelle, David M.] Benaroya Res Inst, Seattle, WA 98104 USA; [Wald, Anna] Univ Washington, Dept Epidemiol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Robins, Harlan] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Program Computat Biol, Seattle, WA 98109 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12110,Article,,jiazhu@u.washington.edu; lcorey@fhcrc.org,+,"National Institutes of Health [R37AI042528, R01AI04252815, P01AI030731, R56AI093746]; James B.

1,123,191.0,"The ability to learn new skills and perfect them with practice applies not only to physical skills but also to abstract skills(1), like motor planning or neuroprosthetic actions. Although plasticity in corticostriatal circuits has been implicated in learning physical skills(2-4), it remains unclear if similar circuits or processes are required for abstract skill learning. Here we use a novel behavioural task in rodents to investigate the role of corticostriatal plasticity in abstract skill learning. Rodents learned to control the pitch of an auditory cursor to reach one of two targets by modulating activity in primary motor cortex irrespective of physical movement. Degradation of the relation between action and outcome, as well as sensory-specific devaluation and omission tests, demonstrate that these learned neuroprosthetic actions are intentional and goal-directed, rather than habitual. Striatal neurons change their activity with learning, with more neurons modulating their activity in relation to target-reaching as learning progresses. Concomitantly, strong relations between the activity of neurons in motor cortex and the striatum emerge. Specific deletion of striatal NMDA receptors impairs the development of this corticostriatal plasticity, and disrupts the ability to learn neuroprosthetic skills. These results suggest that corticostriatal plasticity is necessary for abstract skill learning, and that neuroprosthetic movements capitalize on the neural circuitry involved in natural motor learning.","Koralek, Aaron C.; Jin, Xin; Ii, John D.

2,63,324.0,"mu-Opioid receptors (mu ORs) are G-protein-coupled receptors that are activated by a structurally diverse spectrum of natural and synthetic agonists including endogenous endorphin peptides, morphine and methadone. The recent structures of the mu OR in inactive(1) and agonist-induced active states (Huang et al., ref. 2) provide snapshots of the receptor at the beginning and end of a signalling event, but little is known about the dynamic sequence of events that span these two states. Here we use solution-state NMR to examine the process of mu OR activation using a purified receptor (mouse sequence) preparation in an amphiphile membrane-like environment. We obtain spectra of the mu OR in the absence of ligand, and in the presence of the high-affinity agonist BU72 alone, or with BU72 and a G protein mimetic nanobody. Our results show that conformational changes in transmembrane segments 5 and 6 (TM5 and TM6), which are required for the full engagement of a G protein, are almost completely dependent on the presence of both the agonist and the G protein mimetic nanobody, revealing a weak allosteric coupling between the agonist-binding pocket and the G-protein-coupling interface (TM5 and TM6), similar to that observed for the beta 2-adrenergic receptor(3). Unexpectedly, in the presence of agonist alone, we find larger spectral changes involving intracellular loop 1 and helix 8 compared to changes in TM5 and TM6. These results suggest that one or both of these domains may play a role in the initial interaction with the G protein, and that TM5 and TM6 are only engaged later in the process of complex formation. The initial interactions between the G protein and intracellular loop 1 and/or helix 8 may be involved in G-protein coupling specificity, as has been suggested for other family A G-protein-coupled receptors.","Sounier, Remy; Mas, Camille; Steyaert, Jan; Laeremans, Toon; Manglik, Aashish; Huang, Weijiao; Kobilka, Brian K.; Demene, Helene; Granier, Sebastien","Sounier, R; Mas, C; Steyaert, J; Laeremans, T; Manglik, A; Huang, WJ; Kobilka, BK; Demene, H; Granier, S",375.0,"[Sounier, Remy; Mas, Camille; Granier, Sebastien] Univ Montpellier, Inst Genom Fonct, CNRS, INSERM,U1191,UMR 5203, F-34000 Montpellier, France; [Steyaert, Jan; Laeremans, Toon] Vrije Univ Brussel, Struct Biol Brussels, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Steyaert, Jan; Laeremans, Toon] VIB, Struct Biol Res Ctr, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Manglik, Aashish; Huang, Weijiao; Kobilka, Brian K.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Physiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Demene, Helene] Univ Montpellier, Ctr Biochim Struct, CNRS, INSERM 1054,UMR 5048, F-34090 Montpellier, France",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14680,Article,1476-4687,helene@cbs.cnrs.fr; sebastien.granier@igf.cnrs.fr,+,INSERM; CNRS; National Institutes of Health [NIDA-DA036246],We acknowledge support from INSERM (S.G.) and CNRS (H.D.) and from the National Institutes of Health Grant (NIDA-DA036246 to B.K.K. and S.G.).

3,2,260.0,"To establish productive infection, a retrovirus must insert a DNA replica of its genome into host cell chromosomal DNA(1,2). This process is operated by the intasome, a nucleoprotein complex composed of an integrase tetramer (IN) assembled on the viral DNA ends(3,4). The intasome engages chromosomal DNA within a target capture complex to carry out strand transfer, irreversibly joining the viral and cellular DNA molecules. Although several intasome/transpososome structures from the DDE(D) recombinase superfamily have been reported(4-6), the mechanics of target DNA capture and strand transfer by these enzymes remained unclear. Here we report crystal structures of the intasome from prototype foamy virus in complex with target DNA, elucidating the pre-integration target DNA capture and post-catalytic strand transfer intermediates of the retroviral integration process. The cleft between IN dimers within the intasome accommodates chromosomal DNA in a severely bent conformation, allowing widely spaced IN active sites to access the scissile phosphodiester bonds. Our results resolve the structural basis for retroviral DNA integration and provide a framework for the design of INs with altered target sequences.","Maertens, Goedele N.; Hare, Stephen; Cherepanov, Peter","Maertens, GN; Hare, S; Cherepanov, P",326.0,"[Maertens, Goedele N.; Hare, Stephen; Cherepanov, Peter] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Div Infect Dis, London W2 1PG, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09517,Article,1476-4687,p.cherepanov@imperial.ac.uk,U217,UK Medical Research Council,"We thank A.

4,49,22.0,"The contribution of co-translational chaperone functions to protein folding is poorly understood. Ribosome-associated trigger factor (TF) is the first molecular chaperone encountered by nascent polypeptides in bacteria. Here we show, using fluorescence spectroscopy to monitor TF function and structural rearrangements in real time, that TF interacts with ribosomes and translating polypeptides in a dynamic reaction cycle. Ribosome binding stabilizes TF in an open, activated conformation. Activated TF departs from the ribosome after a mean residence time of similar to 10 s, but may remain associated with the elongating nascent chain for up to 35 s, allowing entry of a new TF molecule at the ribosome docking site. The duration of nascent-chain interaction correlates with the occurrence of hydrophobic motifs in translating polypeptides, reflecting a high aggregation propensity. These findings can explain how TF prevents misfolding events during translation and may provide a paradigm for the regulation of nucleotide-independent chaperones.","Kaiser, Christian M.; Chang, Hung-Chun; Agashe, Vishwas R.; Lakshmipathy, Sathish K.; Etchells, Stephanie A.; Hayer-Hartl, Manajit; Hartl, F.

5,50,39.0,"The most efficient energy sources known in the Universe are accretion disks. Those around black holes convert 5 - 40 per cent of restmass energy to radiation. Like water circling a drain, inflowing mass must lose angular momentum, presumably by vigorous turbulence in disks, which are essentially inviscid(1). The origin of the turbulence is unclear. Hot disks of electrically conducting plasma can become turbulent by way of the linear magnetorotational instability(2). Cool disks, such as the planet- forming disks of protostars, may be too poorly ionized for the magnetorotational instability to occur, and therefore essentially unmagnetized and linearly stable. Nonlinear hydrodynamic instability often occurs in linearly stable flows ( for example, pipe flows) at sufficiently large Reynolds numbers. Although planet- forming disks have extreme Reynolds numbers, keplerian rotation enhances their linear hydrodynamic stability, so the question of whether they can be turbulent and thereby transport angular momentum effectively is controversial(3-15). Here we report a laboratory experiment, demonstrating that non- magnetic quasi- keplerian flows at Reynolds numbers up to millions are essentially steady. Scaled to accretion disks, rates of angular momentum transport lie far below astrophysical requirements. By ruling out purely hydrodynamic turbulence, our results indirectly support the magnetorotational instability as the likely cause of turbulence, even in cool disks.","Ji, Hantao; Burin, Michael; Schartman, Ethan; Goodman, Jeremy","Ji, HT; Burin, M; Schartman, E; Goodman, J",343.0,"Princeton Univ, Ctr Magnet Self Org Lab & Astrophys Plasmas, Plasma Phys Lab, Princeton, NJ 08543 USA; Princeton Univ, Dept Astrophys Sci, Princeton, NJ 08543 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature05323,Article,,hji@pppl.gov,346,,,105GL,,,ROTATING CYLINDERS; ACCRETION DISKS; NONLINEAR STABILITY; SHEAR TURBULENCE; STRATIFIED DISKS; REYNOLDS-NUMBER; INSTABILITY; FLOW; CIRCULATION; EVOLUTION,7117.0,NATURE,Nature,English,32.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",16-Nov,4.0,LONDON,17108959.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,,"Ji, HT (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Ctr Magnet Self Org Lab & Astrophys Plasmas, Plasma Phys Lab, Princeton, NJ 08543 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,139.0,Hydrodynamic turbulence cannot transport angular momentum effectively in astrophysical disks,0.0,16.0,WOS:000242018300042,39.0,444,Multidisciplinary Sciences,139,jeremy,goodman,98.0,1840,male,0.99,OUIu4uoAAAAJ,1,"[0, 1474]",42790519,1,17914517,1,Chloe Goodman,Chloe Goodman,1,1
6,101,366.0,"More than half of mammalian genes generate multiple messenger RNA isoforms that differ in their 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) and therefore in regulatory sequences(1), often associated with cell proliferation and cancer(2,3); however, the mechanisms coordinating alternative 3'-UTR processing for specific mRNA populations remain poorly defined. Here we report that the cytoplasmic-polyadenylation element binding protein 1 (CPEB1), an RNA-binding protein that regulates mRNA translation(4), also controls alternative 3'-UTR processing. CPEB1 shuttles to the nudeus(5,6), where it co-localizes with splicing factors and mediates shortening of hundreds of mRNA 3' UTRs, thereby modulating their translation efficiency in the cytoplasm. CPEB1-mediated 3'-UTR shortening correlates with cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. CPEB1 binding to pre-mRNAs not only directs the use of alternative polyadenylation sites, but also changes alternative splicing by preventing U2AF65 recruitment. Our results reveal a novel function of CPEB1 in mediating alternative 3'-UTR processing, which is coordinated with regulation of mRNA translation, through its dual nuclear and cytoplasmic functions.","Bava, Felice-Alessio; Eliscovich, Carolina; Ferreira, Pedro G.; Minana, Belen; Ben-Dov, Claudia; Guigo, Roderic; Valcarcel, Juan; Mendez, Raul","Bava, FA; Eliscovich, C; Ferreira, PG; Minana, B; Ben-Dov, C; Guigo, R; Valcarcel, J; Mendez, R",121.0,"[Bava, Felice-Alessio; Mendez, Raul] Inst Res Biomed IRB Barcelona, Barcelona 08028, Spain; [Eliscovich, Carolina; Ferreira, Pedro G.; Minana, Belen; Ben-Dov, Claudia; Guigo, Roderic; Valcarcel, Juan] UPF, Ctr Genom Regulat CRG, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Valcarcel, Juan; Mendez, Raul] Passeig Lluis Co 23, ICREA, Barcelona 08010, Spain",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11901,Article,,raul.mendez@irbbarcelona.org,125,"Consolider; MICINN; Generalitat de Catalunya; RNAREG; AICR; EURASNET; Fundacion Marcelino Botin; National Institutes of Health; Instituto de Salud Carlos III; ""la Caixa"" predoctoral fellowship; FCT-Portugal; Spanish MICINN; ICREA","We thank A.

7,37,238.0,"The mass and chemical composition of a star are the primary determinants of its basic physical properties - radius, temperature and luminosity - and how those properties evolve with time(1). Accordingly, two stars born at the same time, from the same natal material and with the same mass, are 'identical twins,' and as such might be expected to possess identical physical attributes. We have discovered in the Orion nebula a pair of stellar twins in a newborn binary star system(2). Each star in the binary has a mass of 0.41 +/- 0.01 solar masses, identical to within 2 per cent. Here we report that these twin stars have surface temperatures differing by similar to 300 K (similar to 10 per cent) and luminosities differing by similar to 50 per cent, both at high confidence level. Preliminary results indicate that the stars' radii also differ, by 5 - 10 per cent. These surprising dissimilarities suggest that one of the twins may have been delayed by several hundred thousand years in its formation relative to its sibling. Such a delay could only have been detected in a very young, definitively equal-mass binary system(3). Our findings reveal cosmic limits on the age synchronization of young binary stars, often used as tests for the age calibrations of star-formation models(4).","Stassun, Keivan G.; Mathieu, Robert D.; Cargile, Phillip A.; Aarnio, Alicia N.; Stempels, Eric; Geller, Aaron","Stassun, KG; Mathieu, RD; Cargile, PA; Aarnio, AN; Stempels, E; Geller, A",1079.0,"[Stassun, Keivan G.; Cargile, Phillip A.; Aarnio, Alicia N.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Mathieu, Robert D.; Geller, Aaron] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Astron, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Stempels, Eric] Univ St Andrews, Sch Phys & Astron, St Andrews KY16 9SS, Fife, Scotland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07069,Article,,keivan.stassun@vanderbilt.edu,1082,,,314WM,,,ORION NEBULA CLUSTER; SEQUENCE ECLIPSING BINARY; LOW-MASS; ABSOLUTE CALIBRATION; FORMING REGION; BROWN DWARFS; SYSTEM; 2MASS; TEMPERATURES; PHOTOMETRY,7198.0,NATURE,Nature,English,29.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",19-Jun,4.0,LONDON,18563159.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,,"Stassun, KG (reprint author), Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,39.0,Surprising dissimilarities in a newly formed pair of 'identical twin' stars,0.0,3.0,WOS:000256839900051,238.0,453,Multidisciplinary Sciences,40,aaron,geller,1008.0,2280,male,1.0,PyNOB1EAAAAJ,1,"[0, 1474]",34068800,1,5923637,1,Laura Geller,Laura Geller,1,1
8,113,339.0,"The jumonji (JMJ) family of histone demethylases are Fe2+ - and a-ketoglutarate-dependent oxygenases that are essential components of regulatory transcriptional chromatin complexes(1-4). These enzymes demethylate lysine residues in histones in a methylation-state and sequence-specific context(5). Considerable effort has been devoted to gaining a mechanistic understanding of the roles of histone lysine demethylases in eukaryotic transcription, genome integrity and epigenetic inheritance(2,4,6), as well as in development, physiology and disease(3,7). However, because of the absence of any selective inhibitors, the relevance of the demethylase activity of JMJ enzymes in regulating cellular responses remains poorly understood. Here we present a structure-guided small-molecule and chemoproteomics approach to elucidating the functional role of the H3K27me3-specific demethylase subfamily (KDM6 subfamily members JMJD3 and UTX)(8). The liganded structures of human and mouse JMJD3 provide novel insight into the specificity determinants for cofactor, substrate and inhibitor recognition by the KDM6 subfamily of demethylases. We exploited these structural features to generate the first small-molecule catalytic site inhibitor that is selective for the H3K27me3-specific JMJ subfamily. We demonstrate that this inhibitor binds in a novel manner and reduces lipopolysaccharide-induced proinflammatory cytokine production by human primary macrophages, a process that depends on both JMJD3 and UTX. Our results resolve the ambiguity associated with the catalytic function of H3K27-specific JMJs in regulating disease-relevant inflammatory responses and provide encouragement for designing small-molecule inhibitors to allow selective pharmacological intervention across the JMJ family.","Kruidenier, Laurens; Chung, Chun-wa; Cheng, Zhongjun; Liddle, John; Che, KaHing; Joberty, Gerard; Bantscheff, Marcus; Bountra, Chas; Bridges, Angela; Diallo, Hawa; Eberhard, Dirk; Hutchinson, Sue; Jones, Emma; Katso, Roy; Leveridge, Melanie; Mander, Palwinder K.; Mosley, Julie; Ramirez-Molina, Cesar; Rowland, Paul; Schofield, Christopher J.; Sheppard, Robert J.; Smith, Julia E.; Swales, Catherine; Tanner, Robert; Thomas, Pamela; Tumber, Anthony; Drewes, Gerard; Oppermann, Udo; Patel, Dinshaw J.; Lee, Kevin; Wilson, David M.","Kruidenier, L; Chung, CW; Cheng, ZJ; Liddle, J; Che, KH; Joberty, G; Bantscheff, M; Bountra, C; Bridges, A; Diallo, H; Eberhard, D; Hutchinson, S; Jones, E; Katso, R; Leveridge, M; Mander, PK; Mosley, J; Ramirez-Molina, C; Rowland, P; Schofield, CJ; Sheppard, RJ; Smith, JE; Swales, C; Tanner, R; Thomas, P; Tumber, A; Drewes, G; Oppermann, U; Patel, DJ; Lee, K; Wilson, DM",404.0,"[Kruidenier, Laurens; Liddle, John; Diallo, Hawa; Mander, Palwinder K.; Ramirez-Molina, Cesar; Sheppard, Robert J.; Smith, Julia E.; Lee, Kevin; Wilson, David M.] GlaxoSmithKline R&D, Med Res Ctr, Immunoinflammat Therapy Area, Epinova DPU, Stevenage SG1 2NY, Herts, England; [Chung, Chun-wa; Bridges, Angela; Hutchinson, Sue; Jones, Emma; Katso, Roy; Leveridge, Melanie; Mosley, Julie; Rowland, Paul; Tanner, Robert; Thomas, Pamela] GlaxoSmithKline R&D, Med Res Ctr, Platform Technol & Sci, Stevenage SG1 2NY, Herts, England; [Cheng, Zhongjun; Patel, Dinshaw J.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Che, KaHing; Bountra, Chas; Schofield, Christopher J.; Tumber, Anthony; Oppermann, Udo] Univ Oxford, Struct Genom Consortium, Headington OX3 7DQ, England; [Che, KaHing; Swales, Catherine; Oppermann, Udo] Univ Oxford, NIHR Biomed Res Unit, Botnar Res Ctr, Oxford OX3 7LD, England; [Joberty, Gerard; Bantscheff, Marcus; Eberhard, Dirk; Drewes, Gerard] Cellzome AG, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11262,Article,1476-4687,david.m.wilson@gsk.com,408,"Starr Foundation; Abby Rockefeller Mauze Trust; Maloris Foundation; Canadian Institutes for Health Research; Canada Foundation for Innovation; Genome Canada; GlaxoSmithKline; Lilly Canada; Novartis Research Foundation; Pfizer; Takeda; Ontario Ministry of Economic Development and Innovation; Wellcome Trust; National Institute for Health and Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Unit, Oxford","We thank the following colleagues for their help and advice in preparing the manuscript: A.

9,54,62.0,"The formation of relativistic jets by an accreting compact object is one of the fundamental mysteries of astrophysics. Although the theory is poorly understood, observations of relativistic jets from systems known as microquasars (compact binary stars)(1,2) have led to a well established phenomenology(3,4). Relativistic jets are not expected to be produced by sources with soft or supersoft X-ray spectra, although two such systems are known to produce relatively low-velocity bipolar outflows(5,6). Here we report the optical spectra of an ultraluminous supersoft X-ray source (ULS7,8) in the nearby galaxy M81 (M81 ULS-1; refs 9, 10). Unexpectedly, the spectra show blueshifted, broad H alpha emission lines, characteristic of baryonic jets with relativistic speeds. These time-variable emission lines have projected velocities of about 17 per cent of the speed of light, and seem to be similar to those from the prototype microquasar SS 433 (refs 11, 12). Such relativistic jets are not expected to be launched from white dwarfs(13), and an origin from a black hole or a neutron star is hard to reconcile with the persistence of M81 ULS-1's soft X-rays(10). Thus the unexpected presence of relativistic jets in a ULS challenges canonical theories of jet formation(3,4), but might be explained by a long-speculated, supercritically accreting black hole with optically thick outflows(14-20).","Liu, Ji-Feng; Bai, Yu; Wang, Song; Justham, Stephen; Lu, You-Jun; Gu, Wei-Min; Liu, Qing-Zhong; Di Stefano, Rosanne; Guo, Jin-Cheng; Cabrera-Lavers, Antonio; Alvarez, Pedro; Cao, Yi; Kulkarni, Shri","Liu, JF; Bai, Y; Wang, S; Justham, S; Lu, YJ; Gu, WM; Liu, QZ; Di Stefano, R; Guo, JC; Cabrera-Lavers, A; Alvarez, P; Cao, Y; Kulkarni, S",108.0,"[Liu, Ji-Feng; Bai, Yu; Wang, Song; Justham, Stephen; Lu, You-Jun; Guo, Jin-Cheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Natl Astron Observ, Key Lab Opt Astron, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China; [Liu, Ji-Feng; Justham, Stephen; Lu, You-Jun] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Astron & Space Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Gu, Wei-Min] Xiamen Univ, Dept Astron, Xiamen 361005, Fujian Province, Peoples R China; [Liu, Qing-Zhong] Chinese Acad Sci, Purple Mt Observ, Key Lab Dark Matter & Space Astron, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Di Stefano, Rosanne] Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Cabrera-Lavers, Antonio; Alvarez, Pedro] Inst Astrofis Canarias, E-38200 San Cristobal la Laguna, Tenerife, Spain; [Cabrera-Lavers, Antonio; Alvarez, Pedro] Univ La Laguna, Dept Astrofis, E-38205 San Cristobal la Laguna, Tenerife, Spain; [Cao, Yi; Kulkarni, Shri] CALTECH, Dept Astron, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15751,Article,1476-4687,jfliu@nao.cas.cn,+,Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB09000000]; 973 Program [2014CB845705]; National Science Foundation of China [NSFC-11333004/11425313]; W.M.

10,43,492.0,"Resolving flow geometry in the mantle wedge is central to understanding the thermal and chemical structure of subduction zones, subducting plate dehydration, and melting that leads to arc volcanism, which can threaten large populations and alter climate through gas and particle emission. Here we show that isotope geochemistry and seismic velocity anisotropy provide strong evidence for trench- parallel flow in the mantle wedge beneath Costa Rica and Nicaragua. This finding contradicts classical models, which predict trench- normal flow owing to the overlying wedge mantle being dragged downwards by the subducting plate. The isotopic signature of central Costa Rican volcanic rocks is not consistent with its derivation from the mantle wedge(1-3) or eroded fore- arc complexes(4) but instead from seamounts of the Galapagos hotspot track on the subducting Cocos plate. This isotopic signature decreases continuously from central Costa Rica to northwestern Nicaragua. As the age of the isotopic signature beneath Costa Rica can be constrained and its transport distance is known, minimum northwestward flow rates can be estimated ( 63 - 190 mm yr(-1)) and are comparable to the magnitude of subducting Cocos plate motion (similar to 85 mm yr(-1)). Trench- parallel flow needs to be taken into account in models evaluating thermal and chemical structure and melt generation in subduction zones.","Hoernle, Kaj; Abt, David L.; Fischer, Karen M.; Nichols, Holly; Hauff, Folkmar; Abers, Geoffrey A.; van den Bogaard, Paul; Heydolph, Ken; Alvarado, Guillermo; Protti, Marino; Strauch, Wilfried","Hoernle, K; Abt, DL; Fischer, KM; Nichols, H; Hauff, F; Abers, GA; van den Bogaard, P; Heydolph, K; Alvarado, G; Protti, M; Strauch, W",1094.0,"[Hoernle, Kaj; Nichols, Holly; van den Bogaard, Paul; Heydolph, Ken] Univ Kiel, SFB 574, D-24148 Kiel, Germany; [Hoernle, Kaj; Hauff, Folkmar; van den Bogaard, Paul] Univ Kiel, Leibniz Inst Marine Sci, IFM GEOMAR, D-24148 Kiel, Germany; [Abt, David L.; Fischer, Karen M.] Brown Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Abers, Geoffrey A.] Boston Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Alvarado, Guillermo] ICE, OSIVAM, Heredia 1000, Costa Rica; [Protti, Marino] Univ Nacl, Observ Vulcanol & Sismol Costa Rica, Heredia 3000, Costa Rica; [Strauch, Wilfried] Inst Nicaraguense Estud Terr, Managua, Nicaragua",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06550,Article,,khoernle@ifm-geomar.de,U4,,,266RB,,,CENTRAL-AMERICAN ARC; SEISMIC ANISOTROPY; SHEAR-WAVE; ELASTIC-CONSTANTS; BACK-ARC; OLIVINE; HISTORY; ASTHENOSPHERE; VOLCANO; MA,7182.0,NATURE,Nature,English,37.0,No,"Protti, Marino/0000-0001-9818-0051","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",28-Feb,5.0,LONDON,18223639.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,"GEOFON, GlobalSeismicNetwork/E-4273-2012","Hoernle, K (reprint author), Univ Kiel, SFB 574, Wischhofstr 1-3, D-24148 Kiel, Germany.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,124.0,Arc-parallel flow in the mantle wedge beneath Costa Rica and Nicaragua,2.0,19.0,WOS:000253453600039,492.0,451,Multidisciplinary Sciences,129,wilfried,strauch,1457.0,35,male,1.0,CVjk25QAAAAJ,1,"[0, 1474]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
11,126,443.0,"Olfactory systems encode odours by which neurons respond and by when they respond(1-3). In mammals, every sniff evokes a precise, odour-specific sequence of activity across olfactory neurons(4-6). Likewise, in a variety of neural systems, ranging from sensory periphery(7,8) to cognitive centres(9), neuronal activity is timed relative to sampling behaviour and/or internally generated oscillations. As in these neural systems, relative timing of activity may represent information in the olfactory system(10,11). However, there is no evidence that mammalian olfactory systems read such cues(12,13). To test whether mice perceive the timing of olfactory activation relative to the sniff cycle ('sniff phase'), we used optogenetics in gene-targeted mice to generate spatially constant, temporally controllable olfactory input. Here we show that mice can behaviourally report the sniff phase of optogenetically driven activation of olfactory sensory neurons. Furthermore, mice can discriminate between light-evoked inputs that are shifted in the sniff cycle by as little as 10 milliseconds, which is similar to the temporal precision of olfactory bulb odour responses(14,15). Electrophysiological recordings in the olfactory bulb of awake mice show that individual cells encode the timing of photoactivation in relation to the sniff in both the timing and the amplitude of their responses. Our work provides evidence that the mammalian olfactory system can read temporal patterns, and suggests that timing of activity relative to sampling behaviour is a potent cue that may enable accurate olfactory percepts to form quickly(11,16).","Smear, Matthew; Shusterman, Roman; O'Connor, Rodney; Bozza, Thomas; Rinberg, Dmitry","Smear, M; Shusterman, R; O'Connor, R; Bozza, T; Rinberg, D",397.0,"[Smear, Matthew; Shusterman, Roman; O'Connor, Rodney; Bozza, Thomas; Rinberg, Dmitry] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA; [Smear, Matthew; Bozza, Thomas] Northwestern Univ, Dept Neurobiol, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10521,Article,,bozza@northwestern.edu; rinbergd@janelia.hhmi.org,U149,"JFRC; NIDCD [R01DC009640, R21DC010911]; Whitehall Foundation; Brain Research Foundation","We thank L.

12,12,256.0,"Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), retrovirus-like elements with long terminal repeats, are widely dispersed in the euchromatic compartment in mammalian cells, comprising similar to 10% of the mouse genome(1). These parasitic elements are responsible for >10% of spontaneous mutations(2). Whereas DNA methylation has an important role in proviral silencing in somatic and germ-lineage cells(3-5), an additional DNA-methylation-independent pathway also functions in embryonal carcinoma and embryonic stem (ES) cells to inhibit transcription of the exogenous gammaretrovirus murine leukaemia virus (MLV)(6-8). Notably, a recent genome-wide study revealed that ERVs are also marked by histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) and H4K20me3 in ES cells but not in mouse embryonic fibroblasts(9). However, the role that these marks have in proviral silencing remains unexplored. Here we show that the H3K9 methyltransferase ESET (also called SETDB1 or KMT1E) and the Kruppel-associated box (KRAB)associated protein 1 (KAP1, also called TRIM28)(10,11) are required for H3K9me3 and silencing of endogenous and introduced retroviruses specifically in mouse ES cells. Furthermore, whereas ESET enzymatic activity is crucial for HP1 binding and efficient proviral silencing, the H4K20 methyltransferases Suv420h1 and Suv420h2 are dispensable for silencing. Notably, in DNA methyltransferase triple knockout (Dnmt1(-/-) Dnmt3a(-/-) Dnmt3b(-/-)) mouse ES cells, ESET and KAP1 binding and ESET-mediated H3K9me3 are maintained and ERVs are minimally derepressed. We propose that a DNA-methylation-independent pathway involving KAP1 and ESET/ESET-mediated H3K9me3 is required for proviral silencing during the period early in embryogenesis when DNA methylation is dynamically reprogrammed.","Matsui, Toshiyuki; Leung, Danny; Miyashita, Hiroki; Maksakova, Irina A.; Miyachi, Hitoshi; Kimura, Hiroshi; Tachibana, Makoto; Lorincz, Matthew C.; Shinkai, Yoichi","Matsui, T; Leung, D; Miyashita, H; Maksakova, IA; Miyachi, H; Kimura, H; Tachibana, M; Lorincz, MC; Shinkai, Y",927.0,"[Matsui, Toshiyuki; Miyashita, Hiroki; Miyachi, Hitoshi; Tachibana, Makoto; Shinkai, Yoichi] Kyoto Univ, Inst Virus Res, Expt Res Ctr Infect Dis, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068507, Japan; [Matsui, Toshiyuki; Miyashita, Hiroki; Tachibana, Makoto; Shinkai, Yoichi] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Biostudies, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068507, Japan; [Leung, Danny; Maksakova, Irina A.; Lorincz, Matthew C.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Med Genet, Inst Life Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada; [Kimura, Hiroshi] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Frontier Biosci, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08858,Article,,mlorincz@interchange.ubc.ca; yshinkai@virus.kyoto-u.ac.jp,U149,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan; CIHR [77805, 92090]","We thank M.

13,62,315.0,"Nearly three-quarters of the growth in global carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels and cement production between 2010 and 2012 occurred in China(1,2). Yet estimates of Chinese emissions remain subject to large uncertainty; inventories of China's total fossil fuel carbon emissions in 2008 differ by 0.3 gigatonnes of carbon, or 15 per cent(1,3-5). The primary sources of this uncertainty are conflicting estimates of energy consumption and emission factors, the latter being uncertain because of very few actual measurements representative of the mix of Chinese fuels. Here we re-evaluate China's carbon emissions using updated and harmonized energy consumption and clinker production data and two new and comprehensive sets of measured emission factors for Chinese coal. We find that total energy consumption in China was 10 per cent higher in 2000-2012 than the value reported by China's national statistics(6), that emission factors for Chinese coal are on average 40 per cent lower than the default values recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(7), and that emissions from China's cement production are 45 per cent less than recent estimates(1,4). Altogether, our revised estimate of China's CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement production is 2.49 gigatonnes of carbon (2 standard deviations = +/-7.3 per cent) in 2013, which is 14 per cent lower than the emissions reported by other prominent inventories(1,4,8). Over the full period 2000 to 2013, our revised estimates are 2.9 gigatonnes of carbon less than previous estimates of China's cumulative carbon emissions(1,4). Our findings suggest that overestimation of China's emissions in 2000-2013 may be larger than China's estimated total forest sink in 1990-2007 (2.66 gigatonnes of carbon)(9) or China's land carbon sink in 2000-2009 (2.6 gigatonnes of carbon)(10).","Liu, Zhu;

14,83,335.0,"PINK1 (PTEN induced putative kinase 1) and PARKIN (also known as PARK2) have been identified as the causal genes responsible for hereditary recessive early-onset Parkinsonism(1,2). PINK1 is a Ser/Thr kinase that specifically accumulates on depolarized mitochondria, whereas parkin is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that catalyses ubiquitin transfer to mitochondrial substrates(3-5). PINK1 acts as an upstream factor for parkin(6,7) and is essential both for the activation of latent E3 parkin activity(8) and for recruiting parkin onto depolarized mitochondria(8-12). Recently, mechanistic insights into mitochondrial quality control mediated by PINK1 and parkin have been revealed(3-5), and PINK1-dependent phosphorylation of parkin has been reported(13-15). However, the requirement of PINK1 for parkin activation was not bypassed by phosphomimetic parkin mutation(15), and how PINK1 accelerates the E3 activity of parkin on damaged mitochondria is still obscure. Here we report that ubiquitin is the genuine substrate of PINK1. PINK1 phosphorylated ubiquitin at Ser 65 both in vitro and in cells, and a Ser 65 phosphopeptide derived from endogenous ubiquitin was only detected in cells in the presence of PINK1 and following a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential. Unexpectedly, phosphomimetic ubiquitin bypassed PINK1-dependent activation of a phosphomimetic parkin mutant in cells. Furthermore, phosphomimetic ubiquitin accelerates discharge of the thioester conjugate formed by UBCH7 (also known as UBE2L3) and ubiquitin (UBCH7 ubiquitin) in the presence of parkin in vitro, indicating that it acts allosterically. The phosphorylation-dependent interaction between ubiquitin and parkin suggests that phosphorylated ubiquitin unlocks autoinhibition of the catalytic cysteine. Our results show that PINK1-dependent phosphorylation of both parkin and ubiquitin is sufficient for full activation of parkin E3 activity. These findings demonstrate that phosphorylated ubiquitin is a parkin activator.","Koyano, Fumika; Okatsu, Kei; Kosako, Hidetaka; Tamura, Yasushi; Go, Etsu; Kimura, Mayumi; Kimura, Yoko; Tsuchiya, Hikaru; Yoshihara, Hidehito; Hirokawa, Takatsugu; Endo, Toshiya; Fon, Edward A.; Trempe, Jean-Francois; Saeki, Yasushi; Tanaka, Keiji; Matsuda, Noriyuki","Koyano, F; Okatsu, K; Kosako, H; Tamura, Y; Go, E; Kimura, M; Kimura, Y; Tsuchiya, H; Yoshihara, H; Hirokawa, T; Endo, T; Fon, EA; Trempe, JF; Saeki, Y; Tanaka, K; Matsuda, N",162.0,"[Koyano, Fumika; Okatsu, Kei; Go, Etsu; Kimura, Mayumi; Kimura, Yoko; Tsuchiya, Hikaru; Yoshihara, Hidehito; Saeki, Yasushi; Tanaka, Keiji; Matsuda, Noriyuki] Tokyo Metropolitan Inst Med Sci, Lab Prot Metab, Setagaya Ku, Tokyo 1568506, Japan; [Koyano, Fumika; Okatsu, Kei] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778561, Japan; [Kosako, Hidetaka] Univ Tokushima, Div Cell Signaling, Fujii Mem Inst Med Sci, Tokushima 7708503, Japan; [Tamura, Yasushi] Nagoya Univ, Res Ctr Mat Sci, Nagoya, Aichi 4648602, Japan; [Kimura, Yoko] Shizuoka Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Shizuoka 4228529, Japan; [Hirokawa, Takatsugu] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Mol Profiling Res Ctr Drug Discovery, Koto Ku, Tokyo 1350064, Japan; [Endo, Toshiya] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Sci, JST CREST Dept Chem, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648602, Japan; [Endo, Toshiya] Kyoto Sangyo Univ, JST CREST Fac Life Sci, Kita Ku, Kyoto 6038555, Japan; [Fon, Edward A.] McGill Univ, McGill Parkinson Program, Dept Neurol & Neurosurg, Montreal Neurol Inst & Hosp, Montreal, PQ H3A 2B4, Canada; [Trempe, Jean-Francois] McGill Univ, Dept Pharmacol & Therapeut, Montreal, PQ H3G 1Y6, Canada; [Matsuda, Noriyuki] Tokyo Metropolitan Inst Med Sci, Prot Metab Project, Setagaya Ku, Tokyo 1568506, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13392,Article,1476-4687,tanaka-kj@igakuken.or.jp; matsuda-nr@igakuken.or.jp,+,"JSPS KAKENHI [23687018, 23-6061, 21000012, 24657072, 22227003]; MEXT KAKENHI [24111557, 25112522, 24112008]; Tomizawa Jun-ichi and Keiko Fund; JST CREST; Platform for Drug Discovery, Informatics, and Structural Life Science from MEXT; McGill University; GRASP from the FRSQ; CIHR; FRSQ; Takeda Science Foundation","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI grant numbers 23687018 (to N.M.), 23-6061 (to K.O.), 21000012 (to K.

15,26,281.0,"Telomeres cap the ends of chromosomes and provide a means to complete replication. The DNA portion of telomeres is synthesized by the enzyme telomerase using part of an RNA subunit as a template for reverse transcription. How the mature 39 end of telomerase RNA is generated has so far remained elusive. Here we show that in Schizosaccharomyces pombe telomerase RNA transcripts must be processed to generate functional telomerase. Characterization of the maturation pathway uncovered an unexpected role for the spliceosome, which normally catalyses splicing of pre- messenger RNA. The first spliceosomal cleavage reaction generates the mature 39 end of telomerase RNA ( TER1, the functional RNA encoded by the ter1(+) gene), releasing the active form of the RNA without exon ligation. Blocking the first step or permitting completion of splicing generates inactive forms of TER1 and causes progressive telomere shortening. We establish that 39 end processing of TER1 is critical for telomerase function and describe a previously unknown mechanism for RNA maturation that uses the ability of the spliceosome to mediate site- specific cleavage.","Box, Jessica A.; Bunch, Jeremy T.; Tang, Wen; Baumann, Peter","Box, JA; Bunch, JT; Tang, W; Baumann, P",910.0,"[Box, Jessica A.; Bunch, Jeremy T.; Tang, Wen; Baumann, Peter] Stowers Inst Med Res, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; [Tang, Wen; Baumann, Peter] Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Dept Mol & Integrat Physiol, Kansas City, KS 66160 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07584,Article,,peb@stowers-institute.org,U71,Stowers Institute for Medical Research; Pew Scholars; Biomedical Sciences Award,"The authors thank H.

16,58,163.0,"Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a frequent disease in which the genetic alterations determining the clinicobiological behaviour are not fully understood. Here we describe a comprehensive evaluation of the genomic landscape of 452 CLL cases and 54 patients with monoclonal B-lymphocytosis, a precursor disorder. We extend the number of CLL driver alterations, including changes in ZNF292, ZMYM3, ARID1A and PTPN11. We also identify novel recurrent mutations in non-coding regions, including the 39 region of NOTCH1, which cause aberrant splicing events, increase NOTCH1 activity and result in a more aggressive disease. In addition, mutations in an enhancer located on chromosome 9p13 result in reduced expression of the B-cell-specific transcription factor PAX5. The accumulative number of driver alterations (0 to >= 4) discriminated between patients with differences in clinical behaviour. This study provides an integrated portrait of the CLL genomic landscape, identifies new recurrent driver mutations of the disease, and suggests clinical interventions that may improve the management of this neoplasia.","Puente, Xose S.; Bea, Silvia; Valdes-Mas, Rafael; Villamor, Neus; Gutierrez-Abril, Jesus; Martin-Subero, Jose I.; Munar, Marta; Rubio-Perez, Carlota; Jares, Pedro; Aymerich, Marta; Baumann, Tycho; Beekman, Renee; Belver, Laura; Carrio, Anna; Castellano, Giancarlo; Clot, Guillem; Colado, Enrique; Colomer, Dolors; Costa, Dolors; Delgado, Julio; Enjuanes, Anna; Estivill, Xavier; Ferrando, Adolfo A.; Gelpi, Josep L.; Gonzalez, Blanca; Gonzalez, Santiago; Gonzalez, Marcos; Gut, Marta; Hernandez-Rivas, Jesus M.; Lopez-Guerra, Monica; Martin-Garcia, David; Navarro, Alba; Nicolas, Pilar; Orozco, Modesto; Payer, Angel R.; Pinyol, Magda; Pisano, David G.; Puente, Diana A.; Queiros, Ana C.; Quesada, Victor; Romeo-Casabona, Carlos M.; Royo, Cristina; Royo, Romina; Rozman, Maria; Russinol, Nuria; Salaverria, Itziar; Stamatopoulos, Kostas; Stunnenberg, Hendrik G.; Tamborero, David; Terol, Maria J.; Valencia, Alfonso; Lopez-Bigas, Nuria; Torrents, David; Gut, Ivo; Lopez-Guillermo, Armando; Lopez-Otin, Carlos; Campo, Elias","Puente, XS; Bea, S; Valdes-Mas, R; Villamor, N; Gutierrez-Abril, J; Martin-Subero, JI; Munar, M; Rubio-Perez, C; Jares, P; Aymerich, M; Baumann, T; Beekman, R; Belver, L; Carrio, A; Castellano, G; Clot, G; Colado, E; Colomer, D; Costa, D; Delgado, J; Enjuanes, A; Estivill, X; Ferrando, AA; Gelpi, JL; Gonzalez, B; Gonzalez, S; Gonzalez, M; Gut, M; Hernandez-Rivas, JM; Lopez-Guerra, M; Martin-Garcia, D; Navarro, A; Nicolas, P; Orozco, M; Payer, AR; Pinyol, M; Pisano, DG; Puente, DA; Queiros, AC; Quesada, V; Romeo-Casabona, CM; Royo, C; Royo, R; Rozman, M; Russinol, N; Salaverria, I; Stamatopoulos, K; Stunnenberg, HG; Tamborero, D; Terol, MJ; Valencia, A; Lopez-Bigas, N; Torrents, D; Gut, I; Lopez-Guillermo, A; Lopez-Otin, C; Campo, E",519.0,"[Puente, Xose S.; Valdes-Mas, Rafael; Gutierrez-Abril, Jesus; Puente, Diana A.; Quesada, Victor; Lopez-Otin, Carlos] Univ Oviedo, Inst Univ Oncol IUOPA, Dept Bioquim & Biol Mol, E-33006 Oviedo, Spain; [Bea, Silvia; Beekman, Renee; Castellano, Giancarlo; Clot, Guillem; Martin-Garcia, David; Navarro, Alba; Royo, Cristina; Russinol, Nuria; Salaverria, Itziar] IDIBAPS, Barcelona 08036, Spain; [Villamor, Neus; Aymerich, Marta; Carrio, Anna; Colomer, Dolors; Costa, Dolors; Gonzalez, Blanca; Lopez-Guerra, Monica; Rozman, Maria; Campo, Elias] Univ Barcelona, IDIBAPS, Hosp Clin, Unitat Hematol, E-08036 Barcelona, Spain; [Martin-Subero, Jose I.; Queiros, Ana C.] Univ Barcelona, Dept Anat Patol Microbiol & Farmacol, E-08036 Barcelona, Spain; [Munar, Marta; Gelpi, Josep L.; Gonzalez, Santiago; Orozco, Modesto; Royo, Romina; Torrents, David] Univ Barcelona, Spanish Natl Bioinformat Inst, Programa Conjunto Biol Computac, BSC,IRB, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; [Rubio-Perez, Carlota; Tamborero, David; Lopez-Bigas, Nuria] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Expt & Hlth Sci, Res Unit Biomed Informat, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Jares, Pedro; Enjuanes, Anna; Pinyol, Magda] IDIBAPS, Unidad Genom, Barcelona 08036, Spain; [Baumann, Tycho; Delgado, Julio; Lopez-Guillermo, Armando] IDIBAPS, Hosp Clin, Serv Hematol, Barcelona 08036, Spain; [Belver, Laura; Ferrando, Adolfo A.] Columbia Univ, Inst Canc Genet, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Colado, Enrique; Payer, Angel R.] Hosp Univ Cent Asturias, Serv Hematol, Oviedo 33011, Spain; [Estivill, Xavier] Pompeu Fabra Univ, Hosp Mar Res Inst IMIM, CRG, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Gonzalez, Marcos; Hernandez-Rivas, Jesus M.] Univ Salamanca, Hosp Univ Salamanca, Ctr Invest Canc, Serv Hematol,IBSAL,CSIC, Salamanca 37007, Spain; [Gut, Marta; Gut, Ivo] Ctr Nacl Anal Genom, Barcelona 08028, Spain; [Nicolas, Pilar; Romeo-Casabona, Carlos M.] Univ Basque Country, Univ Deusto, Catedra Interuniv Derecho & Genoma Humano, Bilbao 48007, Spain; [Pisano, David G.; Valencia, Alfonso] Spanish Natl Bioinformat Inst, Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, Struct Biol & Biocomp Programme, Madrid 28029, Spain; [Stamatopoulos, Kostas] Ctr Res & Technol Hellas, Inst Appl Biosci, Thessaloniki 57001, Greece; [Stunnenberg, Hendrik G.] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Nijmegen Ctr Mol Life Sci, Fac Sci, Dept Mol Biol, NL-6500 HB Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Terol, Maria J.] Hosp Clin Valencia, Serv Hematol, Valencia 46010, Spain",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14666,Article,1476-4687,clo@uniovi.es; ecampo@clinic.ub.es,U115,Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through the Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII); Red Tematica de Investigacion del Cancer (RTICC); Banco Santander through its Santander Universities Global Division,"This work was funded by Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through the Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII) and Red Tematica de Investigacion del Cancer (RTICC).

17,40,318.0,"Targeted protein degradation is largely performed by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, in which substrate proteins are marked by covalently attached ubiquitin chains that mediate recognition by the proteasome. It is currently unclear how the proteasome recognizes its substrates, as the only established ubiquitin receptor intrinsic to the proteasome is Rpn10/S5a (ref. 1), which is not essential for ubiquitin- mediated protein degradation in budding yeast(2). In the accompanying manuscript we report that Rpn13 (refs 3-7), a component of the nine-subunit proteasome base, functions as a ubiquitin receptor(8), complementing its known role in docking de-ubiquitinating enzyme Uch37/UCHL5 (refs 4-6) to the proteasome. Here we merge crystallography and NMRdata to describe the ubiquitin-binding mechanism of Rpn13. We determine the structure of Rpn13 alone and complexed with ubiquitin. The co-complex reveals a novel ubiquitin-binding mode in which loops rather than secondary structural elements are used to capture ubiquitin. Further support for the role of Rpn13 as a proteasomal ubiquitin receptor is demonstrated by its ability to bind ubiquitin and proteasome subunit Rpn2/S1 simultaneously. Finally, we provide a model structure of Rpn13 complexed to diubiquitin, which provides insights into how Rpn13 as a ubiquitin receptor is coupled to substrate deubiquitination by Uch37.","Schreiner, Patrick; Chen, Xiang; Husnjak, Koraljka; Randles, Leah; Zhang, Naixia; Elsasser, Suzanne; Finley, Daniel; Dikic, Ivan; Walters, Kylie J.; Groll, Michael","Schreiner, P; Chen, X; Husnjak, K; Randles, L; Zhang, NX; Elsasser, S; Finley, D; Dikic, I; Walters, KJ; Groll, M",548.0,"[Schreiner, Patrick; Groll, Michael] Tech Univ Munich, Ctr Integrated Prot Sci, Dept Chem, Lehrstuhl Biochem, D-85747 Garching, Germany; [Chen, Xiang; Randles, Leah; Zhang, Naixia; Walters, Kylie J.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Biochem Mol Biol & Biophys, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Husnjak, Koraljka; Dikic, Ivan] Univ Frankfurt, Inst Biochem 2, D-60590 Frankfurt, Germany; [Husnjak, Koraljka; Dikic, Ivan] Mediterranean Inst Life Sci, Tumor Biol Program, Split 21000, Croatia; [Elsasser, Suzanne; Finley, Daniel] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Dikic, Ivan] Univ Split, Sch Med, Dept Immunol, Split 21000, Croatia; [Groll, Michael] Charite Univ Med Berlin CCM, Inst Biochem, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06924,Article,,ivan.dikic@biochem2.de; walte048@umn.edu; michael.groll@ch.tum.de,552,"NCI NIH HHS [CA097004, R01 CA097004, R01 CA097004-05, R01 CA097004-06A1]; NIGMS NIH HHS [GM43601, GM008700, R01 GM043601, R37 GM043601, R37 GM043601-17, T32 GM008700, T32 GM008700-09]",,303EL,,,DEUBIQUITINATING ENZYME; STRUCTURAL BASIS; MULTIUBIQUITIN CHAIN; PROTEIN INTERACTOME; EAP45-GLUE DOMAIN; RECOGNITION; DEGRADATION; COMPLEX; BINDING; SUBUNIT,7194.0,NATURE,Nature,English,28.0,No,"Dikic, Ivan/0000-0001-8156-9511; Husnjak, Koraljka/0000-0003-0573-6239","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",22-May,5.0,LONDON,18497827.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,"Groll, Michael/C-1174-2010; Chen, Xiang/E-2840-2010; Groll, Michael/F-5572-2015; Dikic, Ivan/O-4650-2015; Husnjak, Koraljka/C-3717-2015","Groll, M (reprint author), Tech Univ Munich, Ctr Integrated Prot Sci, Dept Chem, Lehrstuhl Biochem, Lichtenbergstr 4, D-85747 Garching, Germany.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,192.0,Ubiquitin docking at the proteasome through a novel pleckstrin-homology domain interaction,2.0,27.0,WOS:000256023700048,318.0,453,Multidisciplinary Sciences,198,michael,groll,80.0,11094,male,1.0,53LjSh4AAAAJ,1,"[0, 1474]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
18,94,87.0,"Gene expression differs among individuals and populations and is thought to be a major determinant of phenotypic variation. Although variation and genetic loci responsible for RNA expression levels have been analysed extensively in human populations(1-5), our knowledge is limited regarding the differences in human protein abundance and the genetic basis for this difference. Variation in messenger RNA expression is not a perfect surrogate for protein expression because the latter is influenced by an array of post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, and, empirically, the correlation between protein and mRNA levels is generally modest(6,7). Here we used isobaric tag-based quantitative mass spectrometry to determine relative protein levels of 5,953 genes in lymphoblastoid cell lines from 95 diverse individuals genotyped in the HapMap Project(8,9). We found that protein levels are heritable molecular phenotypes that exhibit considerable variation between individuals, populations and sexes. Levels of specific sets of proteins involved in the same biological process covary among individuals, indicating that these processes are tightly regulated at the protein level. We identified cis-pQTLs (protein quantitative trait loci), including variants not detected by previous transcriptome studies. This study demonstrates the feasibility of high-throughput human proteome quantification that, when integrated with DNA variation and transcriptome information, adds a new dimension to the characterization of gene expression regulation.","Wu, Linfeng; Candille, Sophie I.; Choi, Yoonha; Xie, Dan; Jiang, Lihua; Li-Pook-Than, Jennifer; Tang, Hua; Snyder, Michael","Wu, LF; Candille, SI; Choi, Y; Xie, D; Jiang, LH; Li-Pook-Than, J; Tang, H; Snyder, M",79.0,"[Wu, Linfeng; Candille, Sophie I.; Choi, Yoonha; Xie, Dan; Jiang, Lihua; Li-Pook-Than, Jennifer; Tang, Hua; Snyder, Michael] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12223,Article,,huatang@stanford.edu; mpsnyder@stanford.edu,82,NIH,We thank S.

19,88,1.0,"Genomic studies have shown that Neanderthals interbred with modern humans, and that non-Africans today are the products of this mixture(1,2). The antiquity of Neanderthal gene flow into modern humans means that genomic regions that derive from Neanderthals in any one human today are usually less than a hundred kilobases in size. However, Neanderthal haplotypes are also distinctive enough that several studies have been able to detect Neanderthal ancestry at specific loci(1,3-8). We systematically infer Neanderthal haplotypes in the genomes of 1,004 present-day humans(9). Regions that harbour a high frequency of Neanderthal alleles are enriched for genes affecting keratin filaments, suggesting that Neanderthal alleles may have helped modern humans to adapt to non-African environments. We identify multiple Neanderthal-derived alleles that confer risk for disease, suggesting that Neanderthal alleles continue to shape human biology. An unexpected finding is that regions with reduced Neanderthal ancestry are enriched in genes, implying selection to remove genetic material derived from Neanderthals. Genes that are more highly expressed in testes than in any other tissue are especially reduced in Neanderthal ancestry, and there is an approximately fivefold reduction of Neanderthal ancestry on the X chromosome, which is known from studies of diverse species to be especially dense in male hybrid sterility genes(10-12). These results suggest that part of the explanation for genomic regions of reduced Neanderthal ancestry is Neanderthal alleles that caused decreased fertility in males when moved to a modern human genetic background.","Sankararaman, Sriram; Mallick, Swapan; Dannemann, Michael; Pruefer, Kay; Kelso, Janet; Paeaebo, Svante; Patterson, Nick; Reich, David","Sankararaman, S; Mallick, S; Dannemann, M; Prufer, K; Kelso, J; Paabo, S; Patterson, N; Reich, D",354.0,"[Sankararaman, Sriram; Mallick, Swapan; Patterson, Nick; Reich, David] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Sankararaman, Sriram; Mallick, Swapan; Patterson, Nick; Reich, David] Broad Inst Harvard & MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Dannemann, Michael; Pruefer, Kay; Kelso, Janet; Paeaebo, Svante] Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Anthropol, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Reich, David] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12961,Article,1476-4687,sankararaman@genetics.med.harvard.edu; reich@genetics.med.harvard.edu,+,Presidential Innovation Fund of the Max Planck Society; NSF HOMINID [1032255]; NIH [GM100233]; Initiative for the Science of the Human Past at Harvard University,"We thank A.

20,72,76.0,"Transmission spectroscopy has so far detected atomic and molecular absorption in Jupiter-sized exoplanets, but intense efforts to measure molecular absorption in the atmospheres of smaller (Neptune-sized) planets during transits have revealed only featureless spectra(1-4). From this it was concluded that the majority of small, warm planets evolve to sustain atmospheres with high mean molecular weights (little hydrogen), opaque clouds or scattering hazes, reducing our ability to observe the composition of these atmospheres(1-5). Here we report observations of the transmission spectrum of the exoplanet HAT-P-11b (which has a radius about four times that of Earth) from the optical wavelength range to the infrared. We detected water vapour absorption at a wavelength of 1.4 micrometres. The amplitude of the water absorption (approximately 250 parts per million) indicates that the planetary atmosphere is predominantly clear down to an altitude corresponding to about 1 millibar, and sufficiently rich in hydrogen to have a large scale height (over which the atmospheric pressure varies by a factor of e). The spectrum is indicative of a planetary atmosphere in which the abundance of heavy elements is no greater than about 700 times the solar value. This is in good agreement with the core-accretion theory of planet formation, in which a gas giant planet acquires its atmosphere by accreting hydrogen-rich gas directly from the protoplanetary nebula onto a large rocky or icy core(6).","Fraine, Jonathan; Deming, Drake; Benneke, Bjorn; Knutson, Heather; Jordan, Andres; Espinoza, Nestor; Madhusudhan, Nikku; Wilkins, Ashlee; Todorov, Kamen","Fraine, J; Deming, D; Benneke, B; Knutson, H; Jordan, A; Espinoza, N; Madhusudhan, N; Wilkins, A; Todorov, K",526.0,"[Fraine, Jonathan; Deming, Drake; Wilkins, Ashlee] Univ Maryland, Dept Astron, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Fraine, Jonathan; Jordan, Andres; Espinoza, Nestor] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Astrofis, Santiago 7820436, Chile; [Fraine, Jonathan; Benneke, Bjorn; Knutson, Heather] CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Deming, Drake] NASA, Astrobiol Inst Virtual Planetary Lab, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Madhusudhan, Nikku] Univ Cambridge, Inst Astron, Cambridge CB3 0HA, England; [Todorov, Kamen] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Phys, CH-8049 Zurich, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13785,Article,1476-4687,jfraine@astro.umd.edu,+,"'Millennium Institute of Astrophysics (MAS)' of the Millennium Science Initiative, Chilean Ministry of Economy [IC120009]; FONDECYT [1130857]; BASAL CATA [PFB-06]; CONICYT-PCHA/Doctorado Nacional","J.F., A.J. and N.E. acknowledge support from project IC120009 'Millennium Institute of Astrophysics (MAS)' of the Millennium Science Initiative, Chilean Ministry of Economy; FONDECYT project 1130857; and BASAL CATA PFB-06.

21,135,434.0,"M1 protein, a major virulence factor of the leading invasive strain of group A Streptococcus, is sufficient to induce toxic-shock-like vascular leakage and tissue injury. These events are triggered by the formation of a complex between M1 and fibrinogen that, unlike M1 or fibrinogen alone, leads to neutrophil activation. Here we provide a structural explanation for the pathological properties of the complex formed between streptococcal M1 and human fibrinogen. A conformationally dynamic coiled-coil dimer of M1 was found to organize four fibrinogen molecules into a specific cross-like pattern. This pattern supported the construction of a supramolecular network that was required for neutrophil activation but was distinct from a fibrin clot. Disruption of this network into other supramolecular assemblies was not tolerated.

22,28,366.0,"Dome growth and explosive degassing are fundamental processes in the cycle of continental arc volcanism(1,2). Because both processes generate seismic energy, geophysical field studies of volcanic processes are often grounded in the interpretation of volcanic earthquakes(3). Although previous seismic studies have provided important constraints on volcano dynamics(4-6), such inversion results do not uniquely constrain magma source dimension and material properties. Here we report combined optical geodetic and seismic observations that robustly constrain the sources of long-period volcanic earthquakes coincident with frequent explosive eruptions at the volcano Santiaguito, in Guatemala. The acceleration of dome deformation, extracted from high- resolution optical image processing, is shown to be associated with recorded long-period seismic sources and the frequency content of seismic signals measured across a broadband network. These earthquake sources are observed as abrupt subvertical surface displacements of the dome, in which 20 - 50- cm uplift originates at the central vent and propagates at similar to 50 m s(-1) towards the 200- m- diameter periphery. Episodic shifts of the 20 - 80- m thick dome induce peak forces greater than 10(9) N and reflect surface manifestations of the volcanic long- period earthquakes, a broad class of volcano seismic activity that is poorly understood and observed at many volcanic centres worldwide(7). On the basis of these observations, the abrupt mass shift of solidified domes, conduit magma or magma pads may play a part in generating long- period earthquakes at silicic volcanic systems.","Johnson, Jeffrey B.; Lees, Jonathan M.; Gerst, Alexander; Sahagian, Dork; Varley, Nick","Johnson, JB; Lees, JM; Gerst, A; Sahagian, D; Varley, N",377.0,"[Johnson, Jeffrey B.] New Mexico Inst Min & Technol, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Socorro, NM 87801 USA; [Lees, Jonathan M.] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Gerst, Alexander] Univ Hamburg, Inst Geophys, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Sahagian, Dork] Lehigh Univ, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA; [Varley, Nick] Univ Colima, Fac Ciencias, Colima 28045, Mexico",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07429,Article,,jeff.johnson@ees.nmt.edu,381,"US National Science Foundation EAR [0440225, 0440054]","We thank the many personnel involved with instrumentation preparation and field work, including R.

23,128,85.0,"Inhomogeneity-induced magnetoresistance (IMR) reported in some non-magnetic semiconductors(1-8), particularly silicon(1,6-8), has generated considerable interest owing to the large magnitude of the effect and its linear field dependence (albeit at high magnetic fields). Various theories implicate(9-18) spatial variation of the carrier mobility as being responsible for IMR. Here we show that IMR in lightly doped silicon can be significantly enhanced through hole injection, and then tuned by an applied current to arise at low magnetic fields. In our devices, the 'inhomogeneity' is provided by the p-n boundary formed between regions where conduction is dominated by the minority and majority charge carriers (holes and electrons) respectively; application of a magnetic field distorts the current in the boundary region, resulting in large magnetoresistance. Because this is an intrinsically spatial effect, the geometry of the device can be used to enhance IMR further: we designed an IMR device whose room-temperature field sensitivity at low fields was greatly improved, with magnetoresistance reaching 10% at 0.07 T and 100% at 0.2 T, approaching the performance of commercial giant-magnetoresistance devices(19,20). The combination of high sensitivity to low magnetic fields and large high-field response should make this device concept attractive to the magnetic-field sensing industry. Moreover, because our device is based on a conventional silicon platform, it should be possible to integrate it with existing silicon devices and so aid the development of silicon-based magnetoelectronics.","Wan, Caihua; Zhang, Xiaozhong; Gao, Xili; Wang, Jimin; Tan, Xinyu","Wan, CH; Zhang, XZ; Gao, XL; Wang, JM; Tan, XY",304.0,"[Wan, Caihua; Zhang, Xiaozhong; Gao, Xili; Wang, Jimin; Tan, Xinyu] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Adv Mat Lab, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Wan, Caihua; Zhang, Xiaozhong; Gao, Xili; Wang, Jimin; Tan, Xinyu] Tsinghua Univ, Beijing Natl Ctr Electron Microscopy, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10375,Article,,xzzhang@tsinghua.edu.cn,U68,"Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2009CB929202]; National Science Foundation of China [11074141, U0734001]",This work is supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (grant 2009CB929202) and the National Science Foundation of China (grants 11074141 and U0734001).

24,64,333.0,"Flat-slab subduction occurs when the descending plate becomes horizontal at some depth before resuming its descent into the mantle. It is often proposed as a mechanism for the uplifting of deep crustal rocks ('thick-skinned' deformation) far from plate boundaries, and for causing unusual patterns of volcanism, as far back as the Proterozoic eon(1). For example, the formation of the expansive Rocky Mountains and the subsequent voluminous volcanism across much of the western USA has been attributed to a broad region of flat-slab subduction beneath North America that occurred during the Laramide orogeny (80-55 million years ago)(2). Here we study the largest modern flat slab, located in Peru, to better understand the processes controlling the formation and extent of flat slabs. We present new data that indicate that the subducting Nazca Ridge is necessary for the development and continued support of the horizontal plate at a depth of about 90 kilometres. By combining constraints from Rayleigh wave phase velocities with improved earthquake locations, we find that the flat slab is shallowest along the ridge, while to the northwest of the ridge, the slab is sagging, tearing, and re-initiating normal subduction. On the basis of our observations, we propose a conceptual model for the temporal evolution of the Peruvian flat slab in which the flat slab forms because of the combined effects of trench retreat along the Peruvian plate boundary, suction, and ridge subduction. We find that while the ridge is necessary but not sufficient for the formation of the flat slab, its removal is sufficient for the flat slab to fail. This provides new constraints on our understanding of the processes controlling the beginning and end of the Laramide orogeny and other putative episodes of flat-slab subduction.","Antonijevic, Sanja Knezevic; Wagner, Lara S.; Kumar, Abhash; Beck, Susan L.; Long, Maureen D.; Zandt, George; Tavera, Hernando; Condori, Cristobal","Antonijevic, SK; Wagner, LS; Kumar, A; Beck, SL; Long, MD; Zandt, G; Tavera, H; Condori, C",212.0,"[Antonijevic, Sanja Knezevic; Kumar, Abhash] Univ N Carolina, Dept Geol Sci, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Wagner, Lara S.] Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Terr Magnetism, Washington, DC 20015 USA; [Beck, Susan L.; Zandt, George] Univ Arizona, Dept Geosci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Long, Maureen D.] Yale Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Tavera, Hernando; Condori, Cristobal] Inst Geofis Peru, Lima 15012, Peru",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14648,Article,1476-4687,sknezevi@live.unc.edu,+,"NSF [EAR-0944184, EAR-0943991, EAR-0943962, EAR-0908777, EAR-0907880]","We thank R.

25,35,80.0,"The E2F family is conserved from Caenorhabditis elegans to mammals, with some family members having transcription activation functions and others having repressor functions(1,2). Whereas C. elegans(3) and Drosophila melanogaster(4,5) have a single E2F activator protein and repressor protein, mammals have at least three activator and five repressor proteins(1,2,6). Why such genetic complexity evolved in mammals is not known. To begin to evaluate this genetic complexity, we targeted the inactivation of the entire subset of activators, E2f1, E2f2, E2f3a and E2f3b, singly or in combination in mice. We demonstrate that E2f3a is sufficient to support mouse embryonic and postnatal development. Remarkably, expression of E2f3b or E2f1 from the E2f3a locus ( E2f3a(3bki) or E2f3a(1ki), respectively) suppressed all the postnatal phenotypes associated with the inactivation of E2f3a. We conclude that there is significant functional redundancy among activators and that the specific requirement for E2f3a during postnatal development is dictated by regulatory sequences governing its selective spatiotemporal expression and not by its intrinsic protein functions. These findings provide a molecular basis for the observed specificity among E2F activators during development.","Tsai, Shih-Yin; Opavsky, Rene; Sharma, Nidhi; Wu, Lizhao; Naidu, Shan; Nolan, Eric; Feria-Arias, Enrique; Timmers, Cynthia; Opavska, Jana; de Bruin, Alain; Chong, Jean-Leon; Trikha, Prashant; Fernandez, Soledad A.; Stromberg, Paul; Rosol, Thomas J.; Leone, Gustavo","Tsai, SY; Opavsky, R; Sharma, N; Wu, LZ; Naidu, S; Nolan, E; Feria-Arias, E; Timmers, C; Opavska, J; de Bruin, A; Chong, JL; Trikha, P; Fernandez, SA; Stromberg, P; Rosol, TJ; Leone, G",1137.0,"[Tsai, Shih-Yin; Opavsky, Rene; Sharma, Nidhi; Wu, Lizhao; Nolan, Eric; Feria-Arias, Enrique; Timmers, Cynthia; Opavska, Jana; de Bruin, Alain; Chong, Jean-Leon; Trikha, Prashant; Leone, Gustavo] Ohio State Univ, Dept Mol Genet, Coll Biol Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Tsai, Shih-Yin; Opavsky, Rene; Sharma, Nidhi; Wu, Lizhao; Naidu, Shan; Nolan, Eric; Feria-Arias, Enrique; Timmers, Cynthia; Opavska, Jana; de Bruin, Alain; Chong, Jean-Leon; Trikha, Prashant; Leone, Gustavo] Ohio State Univ, Ctr Comprehens Canc, Human Canc Genet Program, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Tsai, Shih-Yin; Opavsky, Rene; Sharma, Nidhi; Wu, Lizhao; Naidu, Shan; Nolan, Eric; Feria-Arias, Enrique; Timmers, Cynthia; Opavska, Jana; de Bruin, Alain; Chong, Jean-Leon; Trikha, Prashant; Leone, Gustavo] Ohio State Univ, Dept Mol Virol Immunol & Med Genet, Coll Med, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Naidu, Shan; Stromberg, Paul; Rosol, Thomas J.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Vet Biosci, Coll Vet Med, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Fernandez, Soledad A.] Ohio State Univ, Ctr Biostat, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07066,Article,,Gustavo.Leone@osumc.edu,U69,"NIH [R01CA85619, R01HD042619, R01CA121275, R01HD047470, P01CA097189, K01CA102328]; DoD awards [BC0300893, BC061730]; T32 fellowship [CA106196]; Pew Charitable Trusts Scholar Award; Leukemia and Lymphoma Society Scholar Award","We thank J.

26,121,153.0,"Understanding the dynamics of correlated many-body quantum systems is a challenge for modern physics. Owing to the simplicity of theirHamiltonians, He-4 (bosons) and He-3 (fermions) have served as model systems for strongly interacting quantum fluids, with substantial efforts devoted to their understanding. An important milestone was the direct observation of the collective phonon-roton mode in liquid He-4 by neutron scattering, verifying Landau's prediction(1) and his fruitful concept of elementary excitations. In a Fermi system, collective density fluctuations (known as 'zero-sound' in He-3, and 'plasmons' in charged systems) and incoherent particle-hole excitations are observed. At small wavevectors and energies, both types of excitation are described by Landau's theory of Fermi liquids(2,3). At higher wavevectors, the collectivemode enters the particle-hole band, where it is strongly damped. The dynamics of Fermi liquids at high wavevectors was thus believed to be essentially incoherent. Here we report inelastic neutron scattering measurements of a monolayer of liquid He-3, observing a roton-like excitation. We find that the collective density mode reappears as a well defined excitation atmomentum transfers larger than twice the Fermi momentum. We thus observe unexpected collective behaviour of a Fermi many-body system in the regime beyond the scope of Landau's theory. A satisfactory interpretation of the measured spectra is obtained using a dynamic many-body theory(4).","Godfrin, Henri; Meschke, Matthias; Lauter, Hans-Jochen; Sultan, Ahmad; Boehm, Helga M.; Krotscheck, Eckhard; Panholzer, Martin","Godfrin, H; Meschke, M; Lauter, HJ; Sultan, A; Bohm, HM; Krotscheck, E; Panholzer, M",576.0,"[Godfrin, Henri; Meschke, Matthias; Sultan, Ahmad] CNRS, Inst Neel, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France; [Godfrin, Henri; Meschke, Matthias; Sultan, Ahmad] Univ Grenoble 1, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France; [Meschke, Matthias] Aalto Univ, Low Temp Lab, Aalto 00076, Finland; [Lauter, Hans-Jochen] Inst Laue Langevin, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France; [Lauter, Hans-Jochen] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Boehm, Helga M.; Krotscheck, Eckhard; Panholzer, Martin] Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Inst Theoret Phys, A-4040 Linz, Austria; [Krotscheck, Eckhard] SUNY Buffalo, Dept Phys, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10919,Article,,henri.godfrin@grenoble.cnrs.fr,579,Austrian Fonds zur Forderung der wissenschaftlichen Forschung (FWF) [P21264]; French Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-2010-INTB-403-01]; EU [228464],"We are grateful to the Austrian-French programme Amadeus for providing initial support; to the Austrian Fonds zur Forderung der wissenschaftlichen Forschung (FWF grant P21264), the French Agence Nationale de la Recherche (project ANR-2010-INTB-403-01) and the EU FRP7 low-temperature infrastructure grant Microkelvin (project number 228464) for funding this research; and to the Institut Laue-Langevin for use of the facility.",915EF,,,ELEMENTARY EXCITATIONS; EFFECTIVE-MASS; NEUTRON-SCATTERING; SPIN FLUCTUATIONS; ZERO SOUND; HE-3; FILMS; PLASMONS; GRAPHITE; DYNAMICS,7391.0,NATURE,Nature,English,31.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",29-Mar,4.0,LONDON,22460903.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2012.0,"Meschke, Matthias/G-5166-2012","Godfrin, H (reprint author), CNRS, Inst Neel, BP 166, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,17.0,Observation of a roton collective mode in a two-dimensional Fermi liquid,5.0,40.0,WOS:000302006100034,153.0,483,Multidisciplinary Sciences,17,martin,panholzer,118.0,3568,male,1.0,oDRnEUgAAAAJ,1,"[0, 1474]",143848,1,143848,1,List of suicides,List of suicides,0,0
27,103,416.0,"Progress in imaging and metrology depends on exquisite control over and comprehensive characterization of wave fields. As reflected in its name, coherent diffractive imaging relies on high coherence when reconstructing highly resolved images from diffraction intensities alone without the need for image-forming lenses(1-3). Fully coherent light can be described adequately by a single pure state. Yet partial coherence and imperfect detection often need to be accounted for, requiring statistical optics or the superposition of states(4,5). Furthermore, the dynamics of samples are increasingly the very objectives of experiments(6). Here we provide a general analytic approach to the characterization of diffractive imaging systems that can be described as low-rank mixed states. We use experimental data and simulations to show how the reconstruction technique compensates for and characterizes various sources of decoherence quantitatively. Based on ptychography(7,8), the procedure is closely related to quantum state tomography and is equally applicable to high-resolution microscopy, wave sensing and fluctuation measurements. As a result, some of the most stringent experimental conditions in ptychography can be relaxed, and susceptibility to imaging artefacts is reduced. Furthermore, the method yields high-resolution images of mixed states within the sample, which may include quantum mixtures or fast stationary stochastic processes such as vibrations, switching or steady flows.","Thibault, Pierre; Menzel, Andreas","Thibault, P; Menzel, A",68.0,"[Thibault, Pierre] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Phys, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Menzel, Andreas] Paul Scherrer Inst, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11806,Article,,pierre.thibault@tum.de,71,European Research Council [279753],"We thank M.

28,106,60.0,"Branching river networks are one of the most widespread and recognizable features of Earth's landscapes and have also been discovered elsewhere in the Solar System(1,2). But the mechanisms that create these patterns and control their spatial scales are poorly understood. Theories based on probability(3-5) or optimality(3,6-8) have proven useful(9), but do not explain how river networks develop over time through erosion and sediment transport. Here we show that branching at the uppermost reaches of river networks is rooted in two coupled instabilities: first, valleys widen at the expense of their smaller neighbours, and second, side slopes of the widening valleys become susceptible to channel incision. Each instability occurs at a critical ratio of the characteristic timescales for soil transport and channel incision. Measurements from two field sites demonstrate that our theory correctly predicts the size of the smallest valleys with tributaries. We also show that the dominant control on the scale of landscape dissection in these sites is the strength of channel incision, which correlates with aridity and rock weakness, rather than the strength of soil transport. These results imply that the fine-scale structure of branching river networks is an organized signature of erosional mechanics, not a consequence of random topology.","Perron, J.

The new specimen, remarkably preserved in three dimensions, contains a single, intra- uterine embryo connected by a permineralized umbilical cord. An amorphous crystalline mass near the umbilical cord possibly represents the recrystallized yolk sac. Another ptyctodont from the Gogo Formation, Austroptyctodus gardineri(7), also shows three small embryos inside it in the same position. Ptyctodontids have already provided the oldest definite evidence for vertebrate copulation(8), and the new specimens confirm that some placoderms had a remarkably advanced reproductive biology, comparable to that of some modern sharks and rays.

30,124,262.0,"The manipulation of light-matter interactions by quantum control of atomic levels has had a profound impact on optical sciences. Such manipulation has many applications, including nonlinear optics at the few-photon level(1-3), slow light(4,5), lasing without inversion(6-8) and optical quantum information processing(9,10). The critical underlying technique is electromagnetically induced transparency, in which quantum interference between transitions in multilevel atoms(11-15) renders an opaque medium transparent near an atomic resonance. With the advent of high-brilliance, accelerator-driven light sources such as storage rings or X-ray lasers, it has become attractive to extend the techniques of optical quantum control to the X-ray regime(16,17). Here we demonstrate electromagnetically induced transparency in the regime of hard X-rays, using the 14.4-kiloelectronvolt nuclear resonance of the Mossbauer isotope iron-57 (a two-level system). We exploit cooperative emission from ensembles of the nuclei, which are embedded in a low-finesse cavity and excited by synchrotron radiation. The spatial modulation of the photonic density of states in a cavity mode leads to the coexistence of superradiant and subradiant states of nuclei, respectively located at an antinode and a node of the cavity field. This scheme causes the nuclei to behave as effective three-level systems, with two degenerate levels in the excited state (one of which can be considered metastable). The radiative coupling of the nuclear ensembles by the cavity field establishes the atomic coherence necessary for the cancellation of resonant absorption. Because this technique does not require atomic systems with a metastable level, electromagnetically induced transparency and its applications can be transferred to the regime of nuclear resonances, establishing the field of nuclear quantum optics.","Roehlsberger, Ralf; Wille, Hans-Christian; Schlage, Kai; Sahoo, Balaram","Rohlsberger, R; Wille, HC; Schlage, K; Sahoo, B",199.0,"[Roehlsberger, Ralf; Wille, Hans-Christian; Schlage, Kai; Sahoo, Balaram] Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron, D-22607 Hamburg, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10741,Article,1476-4687,ralf.roehlsberger@desy.de,203,,,888HI,,,POPULATION-INVERSION; LASER OSCILLATION; ATOMIC GAS; OPTICS,7384.0,NATURE,Nature,English,29.0,No,"Sahoo, Balaram/0000-0002-2050-4746; Rohlsberger, Ralf/0000-0001-6005-5183; Wille, Hans-Christian/0000-0003-0851-3831","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",9-Feb,5.0,LONDON,22318603.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2012.0,"Sahoo, Balaram/E-4828-2011; Wille, Hans-Christian/C-3881-2013; Rohlsberger, Ralf/J-4173-2013","Rohlsberger, R (reprint author), Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron, Notkestr 85, D-22607 Hamburg, Germany.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,80.0,Electromagnetically induced transparency with resonant nuclei in a cavity,3.0,63.0,WOS:000299994100034,262.0,482,Multidisciplinary Sciences,80,balaram,sahoo,806.0,3,male,1.0,6cDBwBEAAAAJ,1,"[0, 1474]",44231522,1,4773382,1,Orthosilicate (ion),Orthosilicate (ion),0,0
31,25,185.0,"Asteroids with satellites are observed throughout the Solar System, from subkilometre near-Earth asteroid pairs to systems of large and distant bodies in the Kuiper belt. The smallest and closest systems are found among the near- Earth and small inner main- belt asteroids, which typically have rapidly rotating primaries and close secondaries on circular orbits. About 15 per cent of near- Earth and main- belt asteroids with diameters under 10 km have satellites(1,2). The mechanism that forms such similar binaries in these two dynamically different populations was hitherto unclear. Here we show that these binaries are created by the slow spinup of a `rubble pile' asteroid by means of the thermal YORP ( Yarkovsky - O'Keefe - Radzievskii - Paddack) effect. We find that mass shed from the equator of a critically spinning body accretes into a satellite if the material is collisionally dissipative and the primary maintains a low equatorial elongation. The satellite forms mostly from material originating near the primary's surface and enters into a close, low- eccentricity orbit. The properties of binaries produced by our model match those currently observed in the small near- Earth and main- belt asteroid populations, including 1999 KW(4) ( refs 3, 4).","Walsh, Kevin J.; Richardson, Derek C.; Michel, Patrick","Walsh, KJ; Richardson, DC; Michel, P",188.0,"[Walsh, Kevin J.; Michel, Patrick] Univ Nice, UMR Cassiopee 6202, CNRS, Observ Cote Azur, F-06304 Nice 4, France; [Walsh, Kevin J.; Richardson, Derek C.] Univ Maryland, Dept Astron, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07078,Article,,kwalsh@oca.eu,191,,,323RU,,,ASTEROID-(66391) 1999 KW4; SATELLITES; COLLISIONS; PARTICLES; MODEL,7201.0,NATURE,Nature,English,21.0,No,"Richardson, Derek C/0000-0002-0054-6850","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",10-Jul,4.0,LONDON,18615078.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,,"Walsh, KJ (reprint author), Univ Nice, UMR Cassiopee 6202, CNRS, Observ Cote Azur, BP 4229, F-06304 Nice 4, France.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,156.0,Rotational breakup as the origin of small binary asteroids,1.0,8.0,WOS:000257466900037,185.0,454,Multidisciplinary Sciences,159,patrick,michel,2404.0,2877,male,1.0,nrKeO54AAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",41286594,1,41286594,1,Patrick Michel,Patrick Michel,1,1
32,49,128.0,"Neural activity increases local blood flow in the central nervous system (CNS), which is the basis of BOLD (blood oxygen level dependent) and PET (positron emission tomography) functional imaging techniques(1-3). Blood flow is assumed to be regulated by precapillary arterioles, because capillaries lack smooth muscle. However, most (65%) noradrenergic innervation of CNS blood vessels terminates near capillaries rather than arterioles(4), and in muscle and brain a dilatory signal propagates from vessels near metabolically active cells to precapillary arterioles(5,6), suggesting that blood flow control is initiated in capillaries. Pericytes, which are apposed to CNS capillaries and contain contractile proteins(7), could initiate such signalling. Here we show that pericytes can control capillary diameter in whole retina and cerebellar slices. Electrical stimulation of retinal pericytes evoked a localized capillary constriction, which propagated at similar to 2 mu m s(-1) to constrict distant pericytes. Superfused ATP in retina or noradrenaline in cerebellum resulted in constriction of capillaries by pericytes, and glutamate reversed the constriction produced by noradrenaline. Electrical stimulation or puffing GABA (gamma-amino butyric acid) receptor blockers in the inner retina also evoked pericyte constriction. In simulated ischaemia, some pericytes constricted capillaries. Pericytes are probably modulators of blood flow in response to changes in neural activity, which may contribute to functional imaging signals and to CNS vascular disease.","Peppiatt, Claire M.; Howarth, Clare; Mobbs, Peter; Attwell, David","Peppiatt, CM; Howarth, C; Mobbs, P; Attwell, D",700.0,"UCL, Dept Physiol, London WC1E 6BT, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature05193,Article,,D.Attwell@ucl.ac.uk,704,"Wellcome Trust [, 017948, 075232]",,093HX,,,RAT RETINA; CONTAINING MICROVASCULATURE; BLOOD-FLOW; IN-VIVO; BRAIN; CALCIUM; MUSCLE; CORTEX; CELLS,7112.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,"Peppiatt-Wildman, Claire/0000-0002-4406-8571","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",12-Oct,5.0,LONDON,17036005.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,,"Attwell, D (reprint author), UCL, Dept Physiol, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,437.0,Bidirectional control of CNS capillary diameter by pericytes,7.0,50.0,WOS:000241160500048,128.0,443,Multidisciplinary Sciences,455,david,attwell,2398.0,12593,male,1.0,PpRdCfQAAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",33588185,1,1804463,1,David Attwell,David Attwell,1,1
33,44,210.0,"The upper atmosphere of a planet is a transition region in which energy is transferred between the deeper atmosphere and outer space. Molecular emissions from the upper atmosphere (90-120 km altitude) of Venus can be used to investigate the energetics and to trace the circulation of this hitherto little-studied region. Previous spacecraft(1) and ground-based(2-4) observations of infrared emission from CO2, O-2 and NO have established that photochemical and dynamic activity controls the structure of the upper atmosphere of Venus. These data, however, have left unresolved the precise altitude of the emission(1) owing to a lack of data and of an adequate observing geometry(5,6). Here we report measurements of day-side CO2 non-local thermodynamic equilibrium emission at 4.3 mu m, extending from 90 to 120 km altitude, and of night-side O-2 emission extending from 95 to 100 km. The CO2 emission peak occurs at similar to 115 km and varies with solar zenith angle over a range of similar to 10 km. This confirms previous modelling(7), and permits the beginning of a systematic study of the variability of the emission. The O-2 peak emission happens at 96 km +/- 1 km, which is consistent with three-body recombination of oxygen atoms transported from the day side by a global thermospheric sub-solar to anti-solar circulation, as previously predicted(8).","Drossart, P.; Piccioni, G.; Gerard, J.

34,84,107.0,"Quasars are rapidly accreting supermassive black holes at the centres of massive galaxies. They display a broad range of properties across all wavelengths, reflecting the diversity in the physical conditions of the regions close to the central engine. These properties, however, are not random, but form well-defined trends. The dominant trend is known as 'Eigenvector l', in which many properties correlate with the strength of optical iron and [O III] emission(1-3). The main physical driver of Eigenvector 1 has long been suspected(4) to be the quasar luminosity normalized by the mass of the hole (the 'Eddington ratio'), which is an important parameter of the black hole accretion process. But a definitive proof has been missing. Here we report an analysis of archival data that reveals that the Eddington ratio indeed drives Eigenvector 1. We also find that orientation plays a significant role in determining the observed kinematics of the gas in the broad-line region, implying a flattened, disk-like geometry for the fast-moving clouds close to the black hole. Our results show that most of the diversity of quasar phenomenology can be unified using two simple quantities: Eddington ratio and orientation.","Shen, Yue; Ho, Luis C.","Shen, Y; Ho, LC",210.0,"[Shen, Yue] Carnegie Observ, Pasadena, CA 91101 USA; [Shen, Yue; Ho, Luis C.] Peking Univ, Kavli Inst Astron & Astrophys, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Ho, Luis C.] Peking Univ, Sch Phys, Dept Astron, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13712,Article,1476-4687,yshen@obs.carnegiescience.edu,+,"NASA through Hubble Fellowship - Space Telescope Science Institute [HST-HF-51314.01]; NASA [NAS 5-26555]; Kavli Foundation, Peking University; Chinese Academy of Science [XDB09030102]","Support for the work of Y.S. was provided by NASA through Hubble Fellowship grant number HST-HF-51314.01,awarded by the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy for NASA, under contract number NAS 5-26555.

36,107,248.0,"DNA replication initiates at defined sites called origins, which serve as binding sites for initiator proteins that recruit the replicative machinery. Origins differ in number and structure across the three domains of life(1) and their properties determine the dynamics of chromosome replication. Bacteria and some archaea replicate from single origins, whereas most archaea and all eukaryotes replicate using multiple origins. Initiation mechanisms that rely on homologous recombination operate in some viruses. Here we show that such mechanisms also operate in archaea. We use deep sequencing to study replication in Haloferax volcanii and identify four chromosomal origins of differing activity. Deletion of individual origins results in perturbed replication dynamics and reduced growth. However, a strain lacking all origins has no apparent defects and grows significantly faster than wild type. Origin-less cells initiate replication at dispersed sites rather than at discrete origins and have an absolute requirement for the recombinase RadA, unlike strains lacking individual origins. Our results demonstrate that homologous recombination alone can efficiently initiate the replication of an entire cellular genome. This raises the question of what purpose replication origins serve and why they have evolved.","Hawkins, Michelle; Malla, Sunir; Blythe, Martin J.; Nieduszynski, Conrad A.; Allers, Thorsten","Hawkins, M; Malla, S; Blythe, MJ; Nieduszynski, CA; Allers, T",544.0,"[Hawkins, Michelle; Nieduszynski, Conrad A.; Allers, Thorsten] Univ Nottingham, Queens Med Ctr, Sch Biol, Nottingham NG7 2UH, England; [Malla, Sunir; Blythe, Martin J.] Univ Nottingham, Queens Med Ctr, Deep Seq, Nottingham NG7 2UH, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12650,Article,1476-4687,conrad.nieduszynski@nottingham.ac.uk; thorsten.allers@nottingham.ac.uk,+,"Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/E023754/1, BB/G001596/1]; Royal Society","This work was supported through the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) (BB/E023754/1, BB/G001596/1).

GLUT5 is also overexpressed in certain tumour cells, and inhibitors are potential drugs for these conditions. Here we describe the crystal structures of GLUT5 from Rattus norvegicus and Bos taurus in open outward-and open inward-facing conformations, respectively. GLUT5 has a major facilitator superfamily fold like other homologous monosaccharide transporters. On the basis of a comparison of the inward-facing structures of GLUT5 and human GLUT1, a ubiquitous glucose transporter, we show that a single point mutation is enough to switch the substrate-binding preference of GLUT5 from fructose to glucose. A comparison of the substrate-free structures of GLUT5 with occluded substrate-bound structures of Escherichia coli XylE suggests that, in addition to global rocker-switch-like re-orientation of the bundles, local asymmetric rearrangements of carboxy-terminal transmembrane bundle helices TM7 and TM10 underlie a 'gated-pore' transport mechanism in such monosaccharide transporters.","Nomura, Norimichi; Verdon, Gregory; Kang, Hae Joo; Shimamura, Tatsuro; Nomura, Yayoi; Sonoda, Yo; Hussien, Saba Abdul; Qureshi, Aziz Abdul; Coincon, Mathieu; Sato, Yumi; Abe, Hitomi; Nakada-Nakura, Yoshiko; Hino, Tomoya; Arakawa, Takatoshi; Kusano-Arai, Osamu; Iwanari, Hiroko; Murata, Takeshi; Kobayashi, Takuya; Hamakubo, Takao; Kasahara, Michihiro; Iwata, So; Drew, David","Nomura, N; Verdon, G; Kang, HJ; Shimamura, T; Nomura, Y; Sonoda, Y; Hussien, SA; Qureshi, AA; Coincon, M; Sato, Y; Abe, H; Nakada-Nakura, Y; Hino, T; Arakawa, T; Kusano-Arai, O; Iwanari, H; Murata, T; Kobayashi, T; Hamakubo, T; Kasahara, M; Iwata, S; Drew, D",397.0,"[Nomura, Norimichi; Shimamura, Tatsuro; Nomura, Yayoi; Sato, Yumi; Abe, Hitomi; Nakada-Nakura, Yoshiko; Hino, Tomoya; Arakawa, Takatoshi; Murata, Takeshi; Kobayashi, Takuya; Iwata, So] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Nomura, Norimichi; Shimamura, Tatsuro; Nomura, Yayoi; Hino, Tomoya; Arakawa, Takatoshi; Murata, Takeshi; Kobayashi, Takuya; Iwata, So] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, ERATO, Iwata Human Receptor Crystallog Project, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Nomura, Norimichi; Shimamura, Tatsuro; Nomura, Yayoi; Nakada-Nakura, Yoshiko; Murata, Takeshi; Kobayashi, Takuya; Iwata, So] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, Res Accelerat Program, Membrane Prot Crystallog Project, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Verdon, Gregory; Kang, Hae Joo; Sonoda, Yo; Iwata, So; Drew, David] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Div Mol Biosci, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Verdon, Gregory; Kang, Hae Joo; Iwata, So] Diamond Light Source, Membrane Prot Lab, Chilton OX11 0DE, Oxon, England; [Verdon, Gregory; Kang, Hae Joo; Iwata, So] Rutherford Appleton Lab, Res Complex Harwell, Didcot OX11 0FA, Oxon, England; [Hussien, Saba Abdul; Qureshi, Aziz Abdul; Coincon, Mathieu; Drew, David] Stockholm Univ, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Ctr Biomembrane Res, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Kusano-Arai, Osamu; Hamakubo, Takao] Univ Tokyo, Dept Quantitat Biol & Med, Res Ctr Adv Sci & Technol, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1538904, Japan; [Murata, Takeshi; Iwata, So] RIKEN, Syst & Struct Biol Ctr, Tsurumi Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Kasahara, Michihiro] Teikyo Univ, Sch Med, Biophys Lab, Hachioji, Tokyo 1920395, Japan",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14909,Article,1476-4687,nnomura@mfour.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp; s.iwata@mfour.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp; ddrew@dbb.su.se,+,"Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation; Royal Society; BBSRC [BB/G02325/1]; ERATO Human Receptor Crystallography Project of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST); Research Acceleration Program of the JST; Targeted Proteins Research Program of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan; MEXT [22570114]; MEXT; Wellcome Trust at the Diamond Light Source Limited [062164/Z/00/Z]; Centre for Biomembrane Research (CBR) - Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research; Human Frontiers Postdoctoral fellowship; EMBO through Young Investigator Program (YIP)","We are grateful to D.

38,100,493.0,"Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder is a common malignancy that causes approximately 150,000 deaths per year worldwide. So far, no molecularly targeted agents have been approved for treatment of the disease. As part of The Cancer Genome Atlas project, we report here an integrated analysis of 131 urothelial carcinomasto provide a comprehensive landscape of molecular alterations. There were statistically significant recurrent mutations in 32 genes, including multiple genes involved in cell-cycle regulation, chromatin regulation, and kinase signalling pathways, as well as 9 genes not previously reported as significantly mutated in any cancer. RNA sequencing revealed four expression subtypes, two of which (papillary-like and basal/squamous-like) were also evident in microRNA sequencing and protein data. Whole-genome and RNA sequencing identified recurrent in-frame activating FGFR3-TACC3 fusions and expression or integration of several viruses (including HPV16) that are associated with gene inactivation. Our analyses identified potential therapeutic targets in 69% of the tumours, including 42% with targets in the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase/AKT/mTOR pathway and 45% with targets (including ERBB2) in the RTK/MAPK pathway. Chromatin regulatory genes were more frequently mutated in urothelial carcinoma than in any other common cancer studied so far, indicating the future possibility of targeted therapy for chromatin abnormalities.","Weinstein, John N.; Akbani, Rehan; Broom, Bradley M.; Wang, Wenyi; Verhaak, Roeland G.

40,144,270.0,"G-protein-coupled receptors are the largest class of cell-surface receptors, and these membrane proteins exist in equilibrium between inactive and active states(1-13). Conformational changes induced by extracellular ligands binding to G-protein-coupled receptors result in a cellular response through the activation of G proteins. The A(2A) adenosine receptor (A(2A)AR) is responsible for regulating blood flow to the cardiac muscle and is important in the regulation of glutamate and dopamine release in the brain(14). Here we report the raising of a mouse monoclonal antibody against human A(2A)AR that prevents agonist but not antagonist binding to the extracellular ligand-binding pocket, and describe the structure of A(2A)AR in complex with the antibody Fab fragment (Fab2838). This structure reveals that Fab2838 recognizes the intracellular surface of A(2A)AR and that its complementarity-determining region, CDR-H3, penetrates into the receptor. CDR-H3 is located in a similar position to the G-protein carboxy-terminal fragment in the active opsin structure(1) and to CDR-3 of the nanobody in the active beta(2)-adrenergic receptor structure(2), but locks A(2A)AR in an inactive conformation. These results suggest a new strategy to modulate the activity of G-protein-coupled receptors.","Hino, Tomoya; Arakawa, Takatoshi; Iwanari, Hiroko; Yurugi-Kobayashi, Takami; Ikeda-Suno, Chiyo; Nakada-Nakura, Yoshiko; Kusano-Arai, Osamu; Weyand, Simone; Shimamura, Tatsuro; Nomura, Norimichi; Cameron, Alexander D.; Kobayashi, Takuya; Hamakubo, Takao; Iwata, So; Murata, Takeshi","Hino, T; Arakawa, T; Iwanari, H; Yurugi-Kobayashi, T; Ikeda-Suno, C; Nakada-Nakura, Y; Kusano-Arai, O; Weyand, S; Shimamura, T; Nomura, N; Cameron, AD; Kobayashi, T; Hamakubo, T; Iwata, S; Murata, T",237.0,"[Hino, Tomoya; Arakawa, Takatoshi; Yurugi-Kobayashi, Takami; Ikeda-Suno, Chiyo; Weyand, Simone; Shimamura, Tatsuro; Nomura, Norimichi; Cameron, Alexander D.; Kobayashi, Takuya; Iwata, So; Murata, Takeshi] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, Iwata Human Receptor Crystallog Project, ERATO, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Hino, Tomoya; Arakawa, Takatoshi; Yurugi-Kobayashi, Takami; Ikeda-Suno, Chiyo; Shimamura, Tatsuro; Nomura, Norimichi; Kobayashi, Takuya; Iwata, So; Murata, Takeshi] Kyoto Univ, Dept Cell Biol, Grad Sch Med, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Iwanari, Hiroko; Nakada-Nakura, Yoshiko; Kusano-Arai, Osamu; Hamakubo, Takao] Univ Tokyo, Dept Mol Biol & Med, Res Ctr Adv Sci & Technol, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1538904, Japan; [Nakada-Nakura, Yoshiko] Perseus Proteom Inc, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1530041, Japan; [Kusano-Arai, Osamu] Inst Immunol Co Ltd, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1120004, Japan; [Weyand, Simone; Cameron, Alexander D.; Iwata, So] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Div Mol Biosci, Membrane Prot Crystallog Grp, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Weyand, Simone; Cameron, Alexander D.; Iwata, So] Diamond Light Source, Membrane Prot Lab, Didcot OX11 0DE, Oxon, England; [Weyand, Simone; Cameron, Alexander D.; Iwata, So] Rutherford Appleton Lab, Didcot OX11 0FA, Oxon, England; [Kobayashi, Takuya] Kyoto Univ, Fac Med, Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Iwata, So; Murata, Takeshi] RIKEN, Syst & Struct Biol Ctr, Tsurumi Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Murata, Takeshi] Chiba Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Chem, Chiba 2638522, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10750,Article,1476-4687,so_iwata@mac.com; t.murata@faculty.chiba-u.jp,U130,"Japan Science and Technology Agency; MEXT, Japan; Development of New Functional Antibody Technologies (New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization, Japan); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/G023425/1]; Wellcome Trust at the Diamond Light Source, UK [062164/Z/00/Z]","This work was supported by the ERATO Human Receptor Crystallography Project of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (S.

41,85,143.0,"Knowledge of the early evolution of fish largely depends on soft-bodied material from the Lower (Series 2) Cambrian period of South China(1,2). Owing to the rarity of some of these forms and a general lack of comparative material from other deposits, interpretations of various features remain controversial(3,4), as do their wider relationships amongst post-Cambrian early un-skeletonized jawless vertebrates. Here we redescribe Metaspriggina(5) on the basis of new material from the Burgess Shale and exceptionally preserved material collected near Marble Canyon, British Columbia(6), and three other Cambrian Burgess Shale-type deposits from Laurentia. This primitive fish displays unambiguous vertebrate features: a notochord, a pair of prominent camera-type eyes, paired nasal sacs, possible cranium and arcualia, W-shaped myomeres, and a post-anal tail. A striking feature is the branchial area with an array of bipartite bars. Apart from the anterior most bar, which appears to be slightly thicker, each is associated with externally located gills, possibly housed in pouches. Phylogenetic analysis places Metaspriggina as a basal vertebrate, apparently close to the Chengjiang taxa Haikouichthys(1-4) and Myllokunmingia(1), demonstrating also that this primitive group of fish was cosmopolitan during Lower-Middle Cambrian times (Series 2-3). However, the arrangement of the branchial region in Metaspriggina has wider implications for reconstructing the morphology of the primitive vertebrate. Each bipartite bar is identified as being respectively equivalent to an epibranchial and ceratobranchial. This configuration suggests that a bipartite arrangement is primitive and reinforces the view that the branchial basket of lampreys(7) is probably derived. Other features of Metaspriggina, including the external position of the gills and possible absence of a gill opposite the more robust anterior-most bar, are characteristic of gnathostomes(8) and so may be primitive within vertebrates.","Morris, Simon Conway; Caron, Jean-Bernard","Morris, SC; Caron, JB",419.0,"[Morris, Simon Conway] Univ Cambridge, Dept Earth Sci, Cambridge CB2 3EQ, England; [Caron, Jean-Bernard] Royal Ontario Museum, Dept Nat Hist Palaeobiol, Toronto, ON M5S 2C6, Canada; [Caron, Jean-Bernard] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13414,Article,1476-4687,sc113@cam.ac.uk; jcaron@rom.on.ca,U413,"Department of Earth Sciences and St John's College, Cambridge; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council [341944]; Royal Ontario Museum [53]","We thank T.

42,61,425.0,"Periodic somite segmentation in vertebrate embryos is controlled by the 'segmentation clock', which consists of numerous cellular oscillators. Although the properties of a single oscillator, driven by a hairy negative-feedback loop, have been investigated, the system-level properties of the segmentation clock remain largely unknown. To explore these characteristics, we have examined the response of a normally oscillating clock in zebrafish to experimental stimuli using in vivo mosaic experiments and mathematical simulation. We demonstrate that the segmentation clock behaves as a coupled oscillator, by showing that Notch-dependent intercellular communication, the activity of which is regulated by the internal hairy oscillator, couples neighbouring cells to facilitate synchronized oscillation. Furthermore, the oscillation phase of individual oscillators fluctuates due to developmental noise such as stochastic gene expression and active cell proliferation. The intercellular coupling was found to have a crucial role in minimizing the effects of this noise to maintain coherent oscillation.","Horikawa, Kazuki; Ishimatsu, Kana; Yoshimoto, Eiichi; Kondo, Shigeru; Takeda, Hiroyuki","Horikawa, K; Ishimatsu, K; Yoshimoto, E; Kondo, S; Takeda, H",719.0,"Univ Tokyo, Dept Biol Sci, Grad Sch Sci, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; Nagoya Univ, Div Biol Sci, Grad Sch Sci, Nagoya, Aichi 4648602, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature04861,Article,,kazu@biol.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp; htakeda@biol.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp,723,,,050NL,,,SOMITE SEGMENTATION; GENE-EXPRESSION; ZEBRAFISH SOMITOGENESIS; LUNATIC-FRINGE; VERTEBRATE SEGMENTATION; INDIVIDUAL FIBROBLASTS; MECHANISM; NETWORK; CELLS; HER1,7094.0,NATURE,Nature,English,44.0,No,"Horikawa, Kazuki/0000-0002-9285-4171","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",8-Jun,5.0,LONDON,16760970.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,"TAKEDA, HIROYUKI/G-4950-2014","Horikawa, K (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Dept Biol Sci, Grad Sch Sci, Hongo 7-3-1, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,161.0,Noise-resistant and synchronized oscillation of the segmentation clock,0.0,16.0,WOS:000238095100046,425.0,441,Multidisciplinary Sciences,166,hiroyuki,takeda,2324.0,29,male,1.0,91YDSugAAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",30108719,1,39665835,1,Hiroyuki Takeda,Hiroyuki Takeda,1,1
43,24,61.0,"The envelope glycoproteins (Env) of human and simian immunodeficiency viruses ( HIV and SIV, respectively) mediate virus binding to the cell surface receptor CD4 on target cells to initiate infection(1). Env is a heterodimer of a transmembrane glycoprotein (gp41) and a surface glycoprotein ( gp120), and forms trimers on the surface of the viral membrane. Using cryo- electron tomography combined with three- dimensional image classification and averaging, we report the three- dimensional structures of trimeric Env displayed on native HIV- 1 in the unliganded state, in complex with the broadly neutralizing antibody b12 and in a ternary complex with CD4 and the 17b antibody. By fitting the known crystal structures(2,3) of the monomeric gp120 core in the b12- and CD4/17b-bound conformations into the density maps derived by electron tomography, we derive molecular models for the native HIV- 1 gp120 trimer in unliganded and CD4- bound states. We demonstrate that CD4 binding results in a major reorganization of the Env trimer, causing an outward rotation and displacement of each gp120 monomer. This appears to be coupled with a rearrangement of the gp41 region along the central axis of the trimer, leading to closer contact between the viral and target cell membranes. Our findings elucidate the structure and conformational changes of trimeric HIV- 1 gp120 relevant to antibody neutralization and attachment to target cells.","Liu, Jun; Bartesaghi, Alberto; Borgnia, Mario J.; Sapiro, Guillermo; Subramaniam, Sriram","Liu, J; Bartesaghi, A; Borgnia, MJ; Sapiro, G; Subramaniam, S",109.0,"[Liu, Jun; Bartesaghi, Alberto; Borgnia, Mario J.; Subramaniam, Sriram] NCI, Cell Biol Lab, Ctr Canc Res, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Sapiro, Guillermo] Univ Minnesota, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07159,Article,,ss1@nih.gov,U76,National Cancer Institute; National Science Foundation and the Department of Defense,"We thank J.

44,64,27.0,"Radiative transfer of energy at the nanometre length scale is of great importance to a variety of technologies including heat-assisted magnetic recording(1), near-field thermophotovoltaics(2) and lithography(3). Although experimental advances have enabled elucidation of near-field radiative heat transfer in gaps as small as 20-30 nanometres (refs 4-6), quantitative analysis in the extreme near field (less than 10 nanometres) has been greatly limited by experimental challenges. Moreover, the results of pioneering measurements(7,8) differed from theoretical predictions by orders of magnitude. Here we use custom-fabricated scanning probes with embedded thermocouples(9,10), in conjunction with new microdevices capable of periodic temperature modulation, to measure radiative heat transfer down to gaps as small as two nanometres. For our experiments we deposited suitably chosen metal or dielectric layers on the scanning probes and microdevices, enabling direct study of extreme near-field radiation between silica-silica, silicon nitride-silicon nitride and gold-gold surfaces to reveal marked, gap-size-dependent enhancements of radiative heat transfer. Furthermore, our state-of-the-art calculations of radiative heat transfer, performed within the theoretical framework of fluctuational electrodynamics, are in excellent agreement with our experimental results, providing unambiguous evidence that confirms the validity of this theory(11-13) for modelling radiative heat transfer in gaps as small as a few nanometres. This work lays the foundations required for the rational design of novel technologies that leverage nanoscale radiative heat transfer.","Kim, Kyeongtae; Song, Bai; Fernandez-Hurtado, Victor; Lee, Woochul; Jeong, Wonho; Cui, Longji; Thompson, Dakotah; Feist, Johannes; Reid, M.

45,141,204.0,"The biogeochemical cycles of iron and organic carbon are strongly interlinked. In oceanic waters, organic ligands have been shown to control the concentration of dissolved iron(1). In soils, solid iron phases shelter and preserve organic carbon(2), but the role of iron in the preservation of organic matter in sediments has not been clearly established. Here we use an iron reduction method previously applied to soils(3) to determine the amount of organic carbon associated with reactive iron phases in sediments of various mineralogies collected from a wide range of depositional environments. Our findings suggest that 21.5 +/- 8.6 per cent of the organic carbon in sediments is directly bound to reactive iron phases. We further estimate that a global mass of (19-45) x 10(15) grams of organic carbon is preserved in surface marine sediments as a result of its association with iron(4). We propose that these associations between organic carbon and iron, which are formed primarily through co-precipitation and/or direct chelation, promote the preservation of organic carbon in sediments. Because reactive iron phases are metastable over geological timescales, we suggest that they serve as an efficient 'rusty sink' for organic carbon, acting as a key factor in the long-term storage of organic carbon and thus contributing to the global cycles of carbon, oxygen and sulphur(5).","Lalonde, Karine; Mucci, Alfonso; Ouellet, Alexandre; Gelinas, Yves","Lalonde, K; Mucci, A; Ouellet, A; Gelinas, Y",198.0,"[Lalonde, Karine; Ouellet, Alexandre; Gelinas, Yves] Concordia Univ, GEOTOP, Montreal, PQ H4B 1R6, Canada; [Lalonde, Karine; Ouellet, Alexandre; Gelinas, Yves] Concordia Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem, Montreal, PQ H4B 1R6, Canada; [Mucci, Alfonso] McGill Univ, GEOTOP, Montreal, PQ H3A 2A7, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10855,Article,,ygelinas@alcor.concordia.ca,200,NSERC; CFI; FQRNT,"This work is dedicated to the memory of J.I.

46,146,425.0,"Climate change is driving latitudinal and altitudinal shifts in species distribution worldwide(1,2), leading to novel species assemblages(3,4). Lags between these biotic responses and contemporary climate changes have been reported for plants and animals(5). Theoretically, the magnitude of these lags should be greatest in lowland areas, where the velocity of climate change is expected to be much greater than that in highland areas(6). We compared temperature trends to temperatures reconstructed from plant assemblages (observed in 76,634 surveys) over a 44-year period in France (1965-2008). Here we report that forest plant communities had responded to 0.54 degrees C of the effective increase of 1.07 degrees C in highland areas (500-2,600 m above sea level), while they had responded to only 0.02 degrees C of the 1.11 degrees C warming trend in lowland areas. There was a larger temperature lag (by 3.1 times) between the climate and plant community composition in lowland forests than in highland forests. The explanation of such disparity lies in the following properties of lowland, as compared to highland, forests: the higher proportion of species with greater ability for local persistence as the climate warms(7), the reduced opportunity for short-distance escapes(8,9), and the greater habitat fragmentation. Although mountains are currently considered to be among the ecosystems most threatened by climate change (owing to mountaintop extinction), the current inertia of plant communities in lowland forests should also be noted, as it could lead to lowland biotic attrition(10).","Bertrand, Romain; Lenoir, Jonathan; Piedallu, Christian; Riofrio-Dillon, Gabriela; de Ruffray, Patrice; Vidal, Claude; Pierrat, Jean-Claude; Gegout, Jean-Claude","Bertrand, R; Lenoir, J; Piedallu, C; Riofrio-Dillon, G; de Ruffray, P; Vidal, C; Pierrat, JC; Gegout, JC",517.0,"[Bertrand, Romain; Piedallu, Christian; Riofrio-Dillon, Gabriela; Pierrat, Jean-Claude; Gegout, Jean-Claude] AgroParisTech, ENGREF, UMR1092, Lab Etud Ressources Foret Bois LERFoB, F-54000 Nancy, France; [Bertrand, Romain; Piedallu, Christian; Riofrio-Dillon, Gabriela; Pierrat, Jean-Claude; Gegout, Jean-Claude] INRA, Ctr Nancy, UMR1092, Lab Etud Ressources Foret Bois LERFoB, F-54280 Champenoux, France; [Lenoir, Jonathan] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Ecoinformat & Biodivers Grp, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [de Ruffray, Patrice] Univ Strasbourg UDS, Inst Biol Mol Plantes IBMP, CNRS, F-67084 Strasbourg, France; [Vidal, Claude] Inventaire Forestier Natl, F-45290 Nogent Sur Marne, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10548,Article,,romain.bertrand@engref.agroparistech.fr,520,"French Institute of Agricultural, Forest and Environmental Engineering (ENGREF, AgroParisTech); National Forest Department (ONF); French Agency for Environment and Energy Management (ADEME); Danish Council for Independent Research - Natural Sciences [272-07-0242]; ADEME; Regional Council of Lorraine","We thank J.-D.

47,39,59.0,"A piezoelectric material is one that generates a voltage in response to a mechanical strain ( and vice versa). The most useful piezoelectric materials display a transition region in their composition phase diagrams, known as a morphotropic phase boundary(1,2), where the crystal structure changes abruptly and the electromechanical properties are maximal. As a result, modern piezoelectric materials for technological applications are usually complex, engineered, solid solutions, which complicates their manufacture as well as introducing complexity in the study of the microscopic origins of their properties. Here we show that even a pure compound, in this case lead titanate, can display a morphotropic phase boundary under pressure. The results are consistent with first-principles theoretical predictions(3), but show a richer phase diagram than anticipated; moreover, the predicted electromechanical coupling at the transition is larger than any known. Our results show that the high electromechanical coupling in solid solutions with lead titanate is due to tuning of the high- pressure morphotropic phase boundary in pure lead titanate to ambient pressure. We also find that complex microstructures or compositions are not necessary to obtain strong piezoelectricity. This opens the door to the possible discovery of high- performance, pure-compound electromechanical materials, which could greatly decrease costs and expand the utility of piezoelectric materials.","Ahart, Muhtar; Somayazulu, Maddury; Cohen, R.

48,18,494.0,"Techniques to detect and quantify DNA and RNA molecules in biological samples have had a central role in genomics research(1-3). Over the past decade, several techniques have been developed to improve detection performance and reduce the cost of genetic analysis(4-10). In particular, significant advances in label-free methods have been reported(11-17). Yet detection of DNA molecules at concentrations below the femtomolar level requires amplified detection schemes(1,8). Here we report a unique nanomechanical response of hybridized DNA and RNA molecules that serves as an intrinsic molecular label. Nanomechanical measurements on a microarray surface have sufficient background signal rejection to allow direct detection and counting of hybridized molecules. The digital response of the sensor provides a large dynamic range that is critical for gene expression profiling. We have measured differential expressions of microRNAs in tumour samples; such measurements have been shown to help discriminate between the tissue origins of metastatic tumours(18). Two hundred picograms of total RNA is found to be sufficient for this analysis. In addition, the limit of detection in pure samples is found to be one attomolar. These results suggest that nanomechanical read-out of microarrays promises attomolar-level sensitivity and large dynamic range for the analysis of gene expression, while eliminating biochemical manipulations, amplification and labelling.","Husale, Sudhir; Persson, Henrik H.

49,73,353.0,"West Africa is currently witnessing the most extensive Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak so far recorded(1-3). Until now, there have been 27,013 reported cases and 11,134 deaths. The origin of the virus is thought to have been a zoonotic transmission from a bat to a two-year-old boy in December 2013 (ref. 2). From this index case the virus was spread by human-to-human contact throughout Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. However, the origin of the particular virus in each country and time of transmission is not known and currently relies on epidemiological analysis, which may be unreliable owing to the difficulties of obtaining patient information. Here we trace the genetic evolution of EBOV in the current outbreak that has resulted in multiple lineages. Deep sequencing of 179 patient samples processed by the European Mobile Laboratory, the first diagnostics unit to be deployed to the epicentre of the outbreak in Guinea, reveals an epidemiological and evolutionary history of the epidemic from March 2014 to January 2015. Analysis of EBOV genome evolution has also benefited from a similar sequencing effort of patient samples from Sierra Leone. Our results confirm that the EBOV from Guinea moved into Sierra Leone, most likely in April or early May. The viruses of the Guinea/Sierra Leone lineage mixed around June/July 2014. Viral sequences covering August, September and October 2014 indicate that this lineage evolved independently within Guinea.

50,89,224.0,"During development, thalamocortical (TC) input has a critical role in the spatial delineation and patterning of cortical areas(1-6), yet the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive cortical neuron differentiation are poorly understood. In the primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory cortex, layer 4 (L4) neurons receive mutually exclusive input originating from two thalamic nuclei(7,8): the ventrobasalis (VB), which conveys tactile input(9,10), and the posterior nucleus (Po), which conveys modulatory and nociceptive input(11-14). Recently, we have shown that L4 neuron identity is not fully committed postnatally(15), implying a capacity for TC input to influence differentiation during cortical circuit assembly. Here we investigate whether the cell-type-specific molecular and functional identity of L4 neurons is instructed by the origin of their TC input. Genetic ablation of the VB at birth resulted in an anatomical and functional rewiring of Po projections onto L4 neurons in S1. This induced acquisition of Po input led to a respecification of postsynaptic L4 neurons, which developed functional molecular features of Po-target neurons while repressing VB-target traits. Respecified L4 neurons were able to respond both to touch and to noxious stimuli, in sharp contrast to the normal segregation of these sensory modalities in distinct cortical circuits. These findings reveal a behaviourally relevant TC-input-type-specific control over the molecular and functional differentiation of postsynaptic L4 neurons and cognate intracortical circuits, which instructs the development of modality-specific neuronal and circuit properties during corticogenesis.","Pouchelon, Gabrielle; Gambino, Frederic; Bellone, Camilla; Telley, Ludovic; Vitali, Ilaria; Luescher, Christian; Holtmaat, Anthony; Jabaudon, Denis","Pouchelon, G; Gambino, F; Bellone, C; Telley, L; Vitali, I; Luscher, C; Holtmaat, A; Jabaudon, D",471.0,"[Pouchelon, Gabrielle; Gambino, Frederic; Bellone, Camilla; Telley, Ludovic; Vitali, Ilaria; Luescher, Christian; Holtmaat, Anthony; Jabaudon, Denis] Univ Geneva, Fac Med, Dept Basic Neurosci, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Luescher, Christian; Jabaudon, Denis] Univ Hosp Geneva, Clin Neurol, Dept Clin Neurosci, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Luescher, Christian; Jabaudon, Denis] Univ Geneva, Inst Genet & Genom Geneva IGE3, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13390,Article,1476-4687,denis.jabaudon@unige.ch,+,Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [PP00P3_123447]; Leenaards Foundation; Synapsis Foundation; NARSAD Foundation; Ambizione grant from the SNF; Gertrude von Meissner Foundation; SNF; Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI); SNF [31003A-135631]; EMBO; International Foundation for Research in Paraplegia; Hans Wilsdorf Foundation,"We thank S.

51,1,0.0,"The El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) system during the Pliocene warm period (PWP; 3-5 million years ago) may have existed in a permanent El Nino state with a sharply reduced zonal sea surface temperature (SST) gradient in the equatorial Pacific Ocean(1). This suggests that during the PWP, when global mean temperatures and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations were similar to those projected for near-term climate change(2), ENSO variability-and related global climate teleconnections-could have been radically different from that today. Yet, owing to a lack of observational evidence on seasonal and interannual SST variability from crucial low-latitude sites, this fundamental climate characteristic of the PWP remains controversial(1,3-10). Here we show that permanent El Nino conditions did not exist during the PWP. Our spectral analysis of the delta(18)O SST and salinity proxy, extracted from two 35-year, monthly resolved PWP Porites corals in the Philippines, reveals variability that is similar to present ENSO variation. Although our fossil corals cannot be directly compared with modern ENSO records, two lines of evidence suggest that Philippine corals are appropriate ENSO proxies. First, delta(18)O anomalies from a nearby live Porites coral are correlated with modern records of ENSO variability. Second, negative-delta(18)O events in the fossil corals closely resemble the decreases in delta(18)O seen in the live coral during El Nino events. Prior research advocating a permanent El Nino state may have been limited by the coarse resolution of many SST proxies, whereas our coral-based analysis identifies climate variability at the temporal scale required to resolve ENSO structure firmly.","Watanabe, Tsuyoshi; Suzuki, Atsushi; Minobe, Shoshiro; Kawashima, Tatsunori; Kameo, Koji; Minoshima, Kayo; Aguilar, Yolanda M.; Wani, Ryoji; Kawahata, Hodaka; Sowa, Kohki; Nagai, Takaya; Kase, Tomoki","Watanabe, T; Suzuki, A; Minobe, S; Kawashima, T; Kameo, K; Minoshima, K; Aguilar, YM; Wani, R; Kawahata, H; Sowa, K; Nagai, T; Kase, T",209.0,"[Watanabe, Tsuyoshi; Minobe, Shoshiro; Kawashima, Tatsunori; Sowa, Kohki; Nagai, Takaya] Hokkaido Univ, Dept Nat Hist Sci, Fac Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan; [Suzuki, Atsushi; Minoshima, Kayo] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Geol Survey Japan, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058567, Japan; [Kameo, Koji] Chiba Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Fac Sci, Chiba 2638522, Japan; [Aguilar, Yolanda M.] Mines & Geosci Bur, Petrolab, Quezon City 1101, Philippines; [Wani, Ryoji] Yokohama Natl Univ, Interdisciplinary Res Ctr, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2408501, Japan; [Kawahata, Hodaka] Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, Kashiwa, Chiba 2775564, Japan; [Kase, Tomoki] Natl Museum Nat & Sci, Dept Geol & Paleontol, Tokyo 1690073, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09777,Article,,nabe@mail.sci.hokudai.ac.jp,211,,,732FK,,,SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; SOUTHERN-OSCILLATION; TROPICAL PACIFIC; CLIMATE; VARIABILITY; PRECIPITATION; PATTERNS; EPOCH,7337.0,NATURE,Nature,English,23.0,No,"Minobe, Shoshiro/0000-0002-9487-9006; KAWAHATA, HODAKA/0000-0003-4236-7356; Wani, Ryoji/0000-0002-3733-769X","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",10-Mar,3.0,LONDON,21390128.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2011.0,"Watanabe, Tsuyoshi/A-5741-2012; Minobe, Shoshiro/E-2997-2010; Nagai, Takaya/C-3428-2011; Minoshima, Kaoru/G-1435-2013; kohki, sowa/D-2955-2011; KAWAHATA, HODAKA/F-9065-2016","Watanabe, T (reprint author), Hokkaido Univ, Dept Nat Hist Sci, Fac Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,60.0,Permanent El Nino during the Pliocene warm period not supported by coral evidence,2.0,51.0,WOS:000288170200035,0.0,471,Multidisciplinary Sciences,62,tomoki,kase,1578.0,4,male,1.0,hWANX-AAAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
52,135,465.0,"In the prehistoric green Sahara of Holocene North Africa-in contrast to the Neolithic of Europe and Eurasia-a reliance on cattle, sheep and goats emerged as a stable and widespread way of life, long before the first evidence for domesticated plants or settled village farming communities(1-3). The remarkable rock art found widely across the region depicts cattle herding among early Saharan pastoral groups, and includes rare scenes of milking; however, these images can rarely be reliably dated(4). Although the faunal evidence provides further confirmation of the importance of cattle and other domesticates(5), the scarcity of cattle bones makes it impossible to ascertain herd structures via kill-off patterns, thereby precluding interpretations of whether dairying was practiced. Because pottery production begins early in northern Africa(6) the potential exists to investigate diet and subsistence practices using molecular and isotopic analyses of absorbed food residues(7). This approach has been successful in determining the chronology of dairying beginning in the 'Fertile Crescent' of the Near East and its spread across Europe(8-11). Here we report the first unequivocal chemical evidence, based on the delta C-13 and Delta C-13 values of the major alkanoic acids of milk fat, for the adoption of dairying practices by prehistoric Saharan African people in the fifth millennium BC. Interpretations are supported by a new database of modern ruminant animal fats collected from Africa. These findings confirm the importance of 'lifetime products', such as milk, in early Saharan pastoralism, and provide an evolutionary context for the emergence of lactase persistence in Africa.","Dunne, Julie; Evershed, Richard P.; Salque, Melanie; Cramp, Lucy; Bruni, Silvia; Ryan, Kathleen; Biagetti, Stefano; di Lernia, Savino","Dunne, J; Evershed, RP; Salque, M; Cramp, L; Bruni, S; Ryan, K; Biagetti, S; di Lernia, S",390.0,"[Dunne, Julie; Evershed, Richard P.; Salque, Melanie; Cramp, Lucy] Univ Bristol, Sch Chem, Organ Geochem Unit, Bristol BS8 1TS, Avon, England; [Bruni, Silvia] Univ Milan, Dipartimento Chim Inorgan Metallorgan & Analit La, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Ryan, Kathleen] Univ Penn, African Sect, Museum Archaeol & Anthropol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Biagetti, Stefano; di Lernia, Savino] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Sci Antichita, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [di Lernia, Savino] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Geog Archaeology& Environm Sci, ZA-2050 Wits, South Africa",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11186,Article,,r.p.evershed@bristol.ac.uk; Savino.Dilernia@uniroma1.it,394,"UK Natural Environment Research Council; Sapienza, University of Rome (Grandi Scavi di Ateneo); Minister of Foreign Affairs (DGSP); USA National Science Foundation; Royal Society","We thank the UK Natural Environment Research Council for a PhD studentship to J.

However, in most plant species members of this family have evolved to transport nitrate as well as additional secondary metabolites and hormones. In response to falling nitrate levels, NRT1.1 is phosphorylated on an intracellular threonine that switches the transporter from a low-affinity to high-affinity state. Here we present both the apo and nitrate-bound crystal structures of Arabidopsis thaliana NRT1.1, which together with in vitro binding and transport data identify a key role for His 356 in nitrate binding. Our data support a model whereby phosphorylation increases structural flexibility and in turn the rate of transport. Comparison with peptide transporters further reveal show the NRT1/PTR family has evolved to recognize diverse nitrogenous ligands, while maintaining elements of a conserved coupling mechanism within this superfamily of nutrient transporters.","Parker, Joanne L.; Newstead, Simon","Parker, JL; Newstead, S",68.0,"[Parker, Joanne L.; Newstead, Simon] Univ Oxford, Dept Biochem, Oxford OX1 3QU, England; [Newstead, Simon] Rutherford Appleton Lab, Didcot OX11 0FA, Oxon, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13116,Article,1476-4687,joanne.parker@bioch.ox.ac.uk; simon.newstead@bioch.ox.ac.uk,+,"Medical Research Council (MRC) [G0900399]; Royal Society [RG110211, IE111401]","We thank R.

54,26,190.0,"All adult flatfishes ( Pleuronectiformes), including the gastronomically familiar plaice, sole, turbot and halibut, have highly asymmetrical skulls, with both eyes placed on one side of the head. This arrangement, one of the most extraordinary anatomical specializations among vertebrates, arises through migration of one eye during late larval development. Although the transformation of symmetrical larvae into asymmetrical juveniles is well documented(1-7), the evolutionary origins of flatfish asymmetry are uncertain(1,2) because there are no transitional forms linking flatfishes with their symmetrical relatives(8,9). The supposed inviability of such intermediates gave pleuronectiforms a prominent role in evolutionary debates(10-16), leading to attacks on natural selection(11) and arguments for saltatory change(14,15). Here I show that Amphistium and the new genus Heteronectes, both extinct spiny- finned fishes from the Eocene epoch of Europe, are the most primitive pleuronectiforms known. The orbital region of the skull in both taxa is strongly asymmetrical, as in living flatfishes, but these genera retain many primitive characters unknown in extant forms. Most remarkably, orbital migration was incomplete in Amphistium and Heteronectes, with eyes remaining on opposite sides of the head in post- metamorphic individuals. This condition is intermediate between that in living pleuronectiforms and the arrangement found in other fishes. Amphistium and Heteronectes indicate that the evolution of the profound cranial asymmetry of extant flatfishes was gradual in nature.","Friedman, Matt","Friedman, M",209.0,"[Friedman, Matt] Univ Chicago, Comm Evolutionary Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Friedman, Matt] Field Museum Nat Hist, Dept Geol, Chicago, IL 60605 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07108,Article,,mattf@uchicago.edu,212,,,323RU,,,PLEURONECTIFORMES; ACANTHOMORPHS; PHYLOGENY; BEHAVIOR; RECORD,7201.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",10-Jul,4.0,LONDON,18615083.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,"Friedman, Matt/F-6991-2012","Friedman, M (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Comm Evolutionary Biol, 1025 E 57th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,59.0,The evolutionary origin of flatfish asymmetry,17.0,101.0,WOS:000257466900042,190.0,454,Multidisciplinary Sciences,64,matt,friedman,2883.0,4915,male,1.0,4d4zhI8AAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
55,50,156.0,"The world's greatest terrestrial stores of biodiversity and carbon are found in the forests of northern South America, where large-scale biogeographic patterns and processes have recently begun to be described(1-4). Seven of the nine countries with territory in the Amazon basin and the Guiana shield have carried out large-scale forest inventories, but such massive data sets have been little exploited by tropical plant ecologists(5-8). Although forest inventories often lack the species-level identifications favoured by tropical plant ecologists, their consistency of measurement and vast spatial coverage make them ideally suited for numerical analyses at large scales, and a valuable resource to describe the still poorly understood spatial variation of biomass, diversity, community composition and forest functioning across the South American tropics(9). Here we show, by using the seven forest inventories complemented with trait and inventory data collected elsewhere, two dominant gradients in tree composition and function across the Amazon, one paralleling a major gradient in soil fertility and the other paralleling a gradient in dry season length. The data set also indicates that the dominance of Fabaceae in the Guiana shield is not necessarily the result of root adaptations to poor soils ( nodulation or ectomycorrhizal associations) but perhaps also the result of their remarkably high seed mass there as a potential adaptation to low rates of disturbance.","ter Steege, Hans; Pitman, Nigel C.

56,136,494.0,"The isotopes Xe-129, produced from the radioactive decay of extinct I-129, and Xe-136, produced from extinct Pu-244 and extant U-238, have provided important constraints on early mantle outgassing and volatile loss from Earth(1,2). The low ratios of radiogenic to non-radiogenic xenon (Xe-129/Xe-130) in ocean island basalts (OIBs) compared with mid-ocean-ridge basalts (MORBs) have been used as evidence for the existence of a relatively undegassed primitive deep-mantle reservoir(1). However, the low Xe-129/Xe-130 ratios in OIBs have also been attributed to mixing between subducted atmospheric Xe and MORB Xe, which obviates the need for a less degassed deep-mantle reservoir(3,4). Here I present new noble gas (He, Ne, Ar, Xe) measurements from an Icelandic OIB that reveal differences in elemental abundances and Ne-20/Ne-22 ratios between the Iceland mantle plume and the MORB source. These observations show that the lower Xe-129/Xe-130 ratios in OIBs are due to a lower I/Xe ratio in the OIB mantle source and cannot be explained solely by mixing atmospheric Xe with MORB-type Xe. Because I-129 became extinct about 100 million years after the formation of the Solar System, OIB and MORB mantle sources must have differentiated by 4.45 billion years ago and subsequent mixing must have been limited. The Iceland plume source also has a higher proportion of Pu- to U-derived fission Xe, requiring the plume source to be less degassed than MORBs, a conclusion that is independent of noble gas concentrations and the partitioning behaviour of the noble gases with respect to their radiogenic parents. Overall, these results show that Earth's mantle accreted volatiles from at least two separate sources and that neither the Moon-forming impact nor 4.45 billion years of mantle convection has erased the signature of Earth's heterogeneous accretion and early differentiation.","Mukhopadhyay, Sujoy","Mukhopadhyay, S",101.0,"Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11141,Article,,sujoy@eps.harvard.edu,U124,NSF [EAR 0911363],"I thank D.

57,125,469.0,"High He-3/He-4 ratios in some basalts have generally been interpreted as originating in an incompletely degassed lower-mantle source(1-9). This helium source may have been isolated at the core-mantle boundary region since Earth's accretion(4-6). Alternatively, it may have taken part in whole-mantle convection and crust production over the age of the Earth(7-9); if so, it is now either a primitive refugium at the core-mantle boundary(8) or is distributed throughout the lower mantle(7,9). Here we constrain the problem using lavas from Baffin Island, West Greenland, the Ontong Java Plateau, Isla Gorgona and Fernandina (Galapagos). Olivine phenocryst compositions show that these lavas originated from a peridotite source that was about 20 per cent higher in nickel content than in the modern mid-ocean-ridge basalt source. Where data are available, these lavas also have high He-3/He-4. We propose that a less-degassed nickel-rich source formed by core-mantle interaction during the crystallization of a melt-rich layer or basal magma ocean(5,6), and that this source continues to be sampled by mantle plumes. The spatial distribution of this source may be constrained by nickel partitioning experiments at the pressures of the core-mantle boundary.","Herzberg, Claude; Asimow, Paul D.; Ionov, Dmitri A.; Vidito, Chris; Jackson, Matthew G.; Geist, Dennis","Herzberg, C; Asimow, PD; Ionov, DA; Vidito, C; Jackson, MG; Geist, D",393.0,"[Herzberg, Claude; Vidito, Chris] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; [Asimow, Paul D.] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Ionov, Dmitri A.] Univ St Etienne, Dept Geol, F-42023 St Etienne 2, France; [Ionov, Dmitri A.] CNRS, UMR 6524, Lab Magmas & Volcans, F-42023 St Etienne, France; [Jackson, Matthew G.] Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Geist, Dennis] Univ Idaho, Dept Geol Sci, Moscow, ID 83844 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11771,Article,1476-4687,herzberg@rci.rutgers.edu,U134,"French INSU-CNRS; NSF [EAR-1119522, EAR1145271]","C.H. thanks L.

Here we use two-photon calcium imaging to record the activity of large populations of neurons at the cellular level, throughout the brain of larval zebrafish expressing a genetically encoded calcium sensor, while the paralysed animals interact fictively with a virtual environment and rapidly adapt their motor output to changes in visual feedback. We decompose the network dynamics involved in adaptive locomotion into four types of neuronal response properties, and provide anatomical maps of the corresponding sites. A subset of these signals occurred during behavioural adjustments and are candidates for the functional elements that drive motor learning. Lesions to the inferior olive indicate a specific functional role for olivocerebellar circuitry in adaptive locomotion.

59,115,479.0,"Folate receptors (FR alpha, FR beta and FR gamma) are cysteine-rich cell-surface glycoproteins that bind folate with high affinity to mediate cellular uptake of folate. Although expressed at very low levels in most tissues, folate receptors, especially FR alpha, are expressed at high levels in numerous cancers to meet the folate demand of rapidly dividing cells under low folate conditions(1-3). The folate dependency of many tumours has been therapeutically and diagnostically exploited by administration of anti-FR alpha antibodies, high-affinity antifolates(4,5), folate-based imaging agents and folate-conjugated drugs and toxins(6-8). To understand how folate binds its receptors, we determined the crystal structure of human FR alpha in complex with folic acid at 2.8 angstrom resolution. FR alpha has a globular structure stabilized by eight disulphide bonds and contains a deep open folate-binding pocket comprised of residues that are conserved in all receptor subtypes. The folate pteroate moiety is buried inside the receptor, whereas its glutamate moiety is solvent-exposed and sticks out of the pocket entrance, allowing it to be conjugated to drugs without adversely affecting FR alpha binding. The extensive interactions between the receptor and ligand readily explain the high folate-binding affinity of folate receptors and provide a template for designing more specific drugs targeting the folate receptor system.","Chen, Chen; Ke, Jiyuan; Zhou, X.

60,22,484.0,"A common hallmark of human cancers is the overexpression of telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein complex that is responsible for maintaining the length and integrity of chromosome ends. Telomere length deregulation and telomerase activation is an early, and perhaps necessary, step in cancer cell evolution. Here we present the high- resolution structure of the Tribolium castaneum catalytic subunit of telomerase, TERT. The protein consists of three highly conserved domains, organized into a ring- like structure that shares common features with retroviral reverse transcriptases, viral RNA polymerases and B- family DNA polymerases. Domain organization places motifs implicated in substrate binding and catalysis in the interior of the ring, which can accommodate seven to eight bases of double- stranded nucleic acid. Modelling of an RNA - DNA heteroduplex in the interior of this ring demonstrates a perfect fit between the protein and the nucleic acid substrate, and positions the 39- end of the DNA primer at the active site of the enzyme, providing evidence for the formation of an active telomerase elongation complex.","Gillis, Andrew J.; Schuller, Anthony P.; Skordalakes, Emmanuel","Gillis, AJ; Schuller, AP; Skordalakes, E",633.0,"[Gillis, Andrew J.; Schuller, Anthony P.; Skordalakes, Emmanuel] Wistar Inst Anat & Biol, Gene Express & Regulat Program, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07283,Article,,skorda@wistar.org,U36,Pennsylvania Department of Health; The Ellison Medical Foundation,We thank R.

61,8,184.0,"Membrane co-transport proteins that use a five-helix inverted repeat motif have recently emerged as one of the largest structural classes of secondary active transporters(1,2). However, despite many structural advances there is no clear evidence of how ion and substrate transport are coupled. Here we report a comprehensive study of the sodium/galactose transporter from Vibrio parahaemolyticus (vSGLT), consisting of molecular dynamics simulations, biochemical characterization and a new crystal structure of the inward-open conformation at a resolution of 2.7 angstrom. Our data show that sodium exit causes a reorientation of transmembrane helix 1 that opens an inner gate required for substrate exit, and also triggers minor rigid-body movements in two sets of transmembrane helical bundles. This cascade of events, initiated by sodium release, ensures proper timing of ion and substrate release. Once set in motion, these molecular changes weaken substrate binding to the transporter and allow galactose readily to enter the intracellular space. Additionally, we identify an allosteric pathway between the sodium-binding sites, the unwound portion of transmembrane helix 1 and the substrate-binding site that is essential in the coupling of co-transport.","Watanabe, Akira; Choe, Seungho; Chaptal, Vincent; Rosenberg, John M.; Wright, Ernest M.; Grabe, Michael; Abramson, Jeff","Watanabe, A; Choe, S; Chaptal, V; Rosenberg, JM; Wright, EM; Grabe, M; Abramson, J",988.0,"[Watanabe, Akira; Chaptal, Vincent; Wright, Ernest M.; Abramson, Jeff] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Physiol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Choe, Seungho; Rosenberg, John M.; Grabe, Michael] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Rosenberg, John M.; Grabe, Michael] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Computat & Syst Biol, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09580,Article,1476-4687,mdgrabe@pitt.edu; jabramson@mednet.ucla.edu,U162,"NIH [GM078844, RGY0069, DK19567]; Human Frontier Science Program","We thank T.

62,240,467.0,"Intense femtosecond (10(-15) s) light pulses can be used to transform electronic, magnetic and structural order in condensed-matter systems on timescales of electronic and atomic motion(1,2,3). This technique is particularly useful in the study(4,5) and in the control(6) of materials whose physical properties are governed by the interactions between multiple degrees of freedom. Time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy is in this context a direct and comprehensive, energy- and momentum-selective probe of the ultrafast processes that couple to the electronic degrees of freedom(7-10). Previously, the capability of such studies to access electron momentum space away from zero momentum was, however, restricted owing to limitations of the available probing photon energy(10,11). Here, using femtosecond extreme-ultraviolet pulses delivered by a high-harmonic-generation source, we use time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to measure the photoinduced vaporization of a charge-ordered state in the potential excitonic insulator 1T-TiSe(2) (refs 12, 13). By way of stroboscopic imaging of electronic band dispersions at large momentum, in the vicinity of the edge of the first Brillouin zone, we reveal that the collapse of atomic-scale periodic long-range order happens on a timescale as short as 20 femtoseconds. The surprisingly fast response of the system is assigned to screening by the transient generation of free charge carriers. Similar screening scenarios are likely to be relevant in other photoinduced solid-state transitions and may generally determine the response times. Moreover, as electron states with large momenta govern fundamental electronic properties in condensed matter systems(14), we anticipate that the experimental advance represented by the present study will be useful to study the ultrafast dynamics and microscopic mechanisms of electronic phenomena in a wide range of materials.","Rohwer, Timm; Hellmann, Stefan; Wiesenmayer, Martin; Sohrt, Christian; Stange, Ankatrin; Slomski, Bartosz; Carr, Adra; Liu, Yanwei; Miaja-Avila, Luis; Kallaene, Matthias; Mathias, Stefan; Kipp, Lutz; Rossnagel, Kai; Bauer, Michael","Rohwer, T; Hellmann, S; Wiesenmayer, M; Sohrt, C; Stange, A; Slomski, B; Carr, A; Liu, YW; Miaja-Avila, L; Kallane, M; Mathias, S; Kipp, L; Rossnagel, K; Bauer, M",490.0,"[Rohwer, Timm; Hellmann, Stefan; Wiesenmayer, Martin; Sohrt, Christian; Stange, Ankatrin; Slomski, Bartosz; Kallaene, Matthias; Kipp, Lutz; Rossnagel, Kai; Bauer, Michael] Univ Kiel, Inst Expt & Appl Phys, D-24118 Kiel, Germany; [Carr, Adra; Mathias, Stefan] Univ Colorado, JILA, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Carr, Adra; Mathias, Stefan] NIST, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Liu, Yanwei] Univ Calif Berkeley, NSF ERC Extreme Ultraviolet Sci & Technol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Liu, Yanwei] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Ctr Xray Opt, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Miaja-Avila, Luis] Univ Texas Austin, Ctr Nano & Mol Sci, Austin, TX 78722 USA; [Mathias, Stefan] Univ Kaiserslautern, Dept Phys, D-67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany; [Mathias, Stefan] Univ Kaiserslautern, Res Ctr OPTIMAS, D-67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09829,Article,,rossnagel@physik.uni-kiel.de; bauer@physik.uni-kiel.de,+,"JILA Physics Frontier Center; German Science Foundation (DFG) [SFB 855]; European Community [GA 253316]; US Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences; NSF EUV ERC","M.B. and S.M. thank M.

63,23,155.0,"NGC 6791 is a well studied open cluster(1) that it is so close to us that can be imaged down to very faint luminosities(2). The main-sequence turn-off age (similar to 8 Gyr) and the age derived from the termination of the white dwarf cooling sequence (similar to 6 Gyr) are very different. One possible explanation is that as white dwarfs cool, one of the ashes of helium burning, (22)Ne, sinks in the deep interior of these stars(3-5). At lower temperatures, white dwarfs are expected to crystallize and phase separation of the main constituents of the core of a typical white dwarf ((12)C and (16)O) is expected to occur(6,7). This sequence of events is expected to introduce long delays in the cooling times(8,9), but has not hitherto been proven.

64,119,11.0,"The most important energy development of the past decade has been the wide deployment of hydraulic fracturing technologies that enable the production of previously uneconomic shale gas resources in North America(1). If these advanced gas production technologies were to be deployed globally, the energy market could see a large influx of economically competitive unconventional gas resources(2). The climate implications of such abundant natural gas have been hotly debated. Some researchers have observed that abundant natural gas substituting for coal could reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions(3-6). Others have reported that the non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions associated with shale gas production make its lifecycle emissions higher than those of coal(7,8). Assessment of the full impact of abundant gas on climate change requires an integrated approach to the global energyeconomyclimate systems, but the literature has been limited in either its geographic scope(9,10) or its coverage of greenhouse gases(2). Here we show that market-driven increases in global supplies of unconventional natural gas do not discernibly reduce the trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions or climate forcing. Our results, based on simulations from five state-of-the-art integrated assessment models(11) of energyeconomyclimate systems independently forced by an abundant gas scenario, project large additional natural gas consumption of up to +170 per cent by 2050. The impact on CO2 emissions, however, is found to be much smaller (from -2 per cent to +11 per cent), and a majority of the models reported a small increase in climate forcing (from -0.3 per cent to +7 per cent) associated with the increased use of abundant gas. Our results show that although market penetration of globally abundant gas may substantially change the future energy system, it is not necessarily an effective substitute for climate change mitigation policy(9,10).","McJeon, Haewon; Edmonds, Jae; Bauer, Nico; Clarke, Leon; Fisher, Brian; Flannery, Brian P.; Hilaire, Jerome; Krey, Volker; Marangoni, Giacomo; Mi, Raymond; Riahi, Keywan; Rogner, Holger; Tavoni, Massimo","McJeon, H; Edmonds, J; Bauer, N; Clarke, L; Fisher, B; Flannery, BP; Hilaire, J; Krey, V; Marangoni, G; Mi, R; Riahi, K; Rogner, H; Tavoni, M",482.0,"[McJeon, Haewon; Edmonds, Jae; Clarke, Leon] Pacific NW Natl Lab, JGCRI, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Bauer, Nico; Hilaire, Jerome] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Fisher, Brian; Mi, Raymond] BAEconomics, Kingston, ACT 2604, Australia; [Flannery, Brian P.] Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Krey, Volker; Riahi, Keywan; Rogner, Holger] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Marangoni, Giacomo; Tavoni, Massimo] Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, I-20156 Milan, Italy; [Marangoni, Giacomo; Tavoni, Massimo] Politecn Milan, I-20156 Milan, Italy",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13837,Article,1476-4687,haewon.mcjeon@pnnl.gov,+,"BAEconomics; Global Technology Strategy Project; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research; Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research; Italian Ministry of Environment, Land and Sea under the GEMINA project","B.F. and R.M. and their development of BAEGEM were supported by BAEconomics with assistance for special applications to the resource sector from Rio Tinto (Australia).

Although the mtDNA of human cells is considered to be homogeneous, we found widespread heterogeneity (heteroplasmy) in the mtDNA of normal human cells. Moreover, the frequency of heteroplasmic variants varied considerably between different tissues in the same individual. In addition to the variants identified in normal tissues, cancer cells harboured further homoplasmic and heteroplasmic mutations that could also be detected in patient plasma. These studies provide insights into the nature and variability of mtDNA sequences and have implications for mitochondrial processes during embryogenesis, cancer biomarker development and forensic analysis. In particular, they demonstrate that individual humans are characterized by a complex mixture of related mitochondrial genotypes rather than a single genotype.","He, Yiping; Wu, Jian; Dressman, Devin C.; Iacobuzio-Donahue, Christine; Markowitz, Sanford D.; Velculescu, Victor E.; Diaz, Luis A., Jr.; Kinzler, Kenneth W.; Vogelstein, Bert; Papadopoulos, Nickolas","He, YP; Wu, J; Dressman, DC; Iacobuzio-Donahue, C; Markowitz, SD; Velculescu, VE; Diaz, LA; Kinzler, KW; Vogelstein, B; Papadopoulos, N",610.0,"[He, Yiping; Wu, Jian; Dressman, Devin C.; Velculescu, Victor E.; Diaz, Luis A., Jr.; Kinzler, Kenneth W.; Vogelstein, Bert; Papadopoulos, Nickolas] Johns Hopkins Kimmel Canc Ctr, Ludwig Ctr Canc Genet & Therapeut, Baltimore, MD 21231 USA; [He, Yiping; Wu, Jian; Dressman, Devin C.; Velculescu, Victor E.; Diaz, Luis A., Jr.; Kinzler, Kenneth W.; Vogelstein, Bert; Papadopoulos, Nickolas] Johns Hopkins Kimmel Canc Ctr, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Baltimore, MD 21231 USA; [Iacobuzio-Donahue, Christine] Johns Hopkins Med Inst, Dept Pathol, Baltimore, MD 21231 USA; [Markowitz, Sanford D.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Med, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Markowitz, Sanford D.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Ireland Canc Ctr, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Markowitz, Sanford D.] Univ Hosp Cleveland, Case Med Ctr, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Markowitz, Sanford D.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08802,Article,,vogelbe@jhmi.edu; npapado1@jhmi.edu,U175,"The Virginia and D.

66,225,56.0,"The stable isotope ratios of atmospheric CO2 (O-18/O-16 and C-13/C-12) have been monitored since 1977 to improve our understanding of the global carbon cycle, because biosphere-atmosphere exchange fluxes affect the different atomic masses in a measurable way(1). Interpreting the O-18/O-16 variability has proved difficult, however, because oxygen isotopes in CO2 are influenced by both the carbon cycle and the water cycle(2). Previous attention focused on the decreasing O-18/O-16 ratio in the 1990s, observed by the global Cooperative Air Sampling Network of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Earth System Research Laboratory. This decrease was attributed variously to a number of processes including an increase in Northern Hemisphere soil respiration(3); a global increase in C-4 crops at the expense of C-3 forests(4); and environmental conditions, such as atmospheric turbulence(5) and solar radiation(6), that affect CO2 exchange between leaves and the atmosphere. Here we present 30 years' worth of data on O-18/O-16 in CO2 from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography global flask network and show that the interannual variability is strongly related to the El Nino/Southern Oscillation. We suggest that the redistribution of moisture and rainfall in the tropics during an El Nino increases the O-18/O-16 ratio of precipitation and plant water, and that this signal is then passed on to atmospheric CO2 by biosphere-atmosphere gas exchange. We show how the decay time of the El Nino anomaly in this data set can be useful in constraining global gross primary production. Our analysis shows a rapid recovery from El Nino events, implying a shorter cycling time of CO2 with respect to the terrestrial biosphere and oceans than previously estimated. Our analysis suggests that current estimates of global gross primary production, of 120 petagrams of carbon per year(7), may be too low, and that a best guess of 150-175 petagrams of carbon per year better reflects the observed rapid cycling of CO2. Although still tentative, such a revision would present a new benchmark by which to evaluate global biospheric carbon cycling models.","Welp, Lisa R.; Keeling, Ralph F.; Meijer, Harro A.

67,199,0.0,"Protein synthesis involves the translation of ribonucleic acid information into proteins, the building blocks of life. The initial step of protein synthesis is the binding of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) to the 7-methylguanosine (m(7)-GpppG) 5' cap of messenger RNAs1,2. Low oxygen tension (hypoxia) represses cap-mediated translation by sequestering eIF4E through mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)dependent mechanisms(3-6). Although the internal ribosome entry site is an alternative translation initiation mechanism, this pathway alone cannot account for the translational capacity of hypoxic cells(7,8). This raises a fundamental question in biology as to how proteins are synthesized in periods of oxygen scarcity and eIF4E inhibition(9). Here we describe an oxygen-regulated translation initiation complex that mediates selective cap-dependent protein synthesis. We show that hypoxia stimulates the formation of a complex that includes the oxygen-regulated hypoxia-inducible factor 2 alpha (HIF-2 alpha), the RNA-binding protein RBM4 and the cap-binding eIF4E2, an eIF4E homologue. Photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP)(10) analysis identified an RNA hypoxia response element (rHRE) that recruits this complex to a wide array of mRNAs, including that encoding the epidermal growth factor receptor. Once assembled at the rHRE, the HIF-2 alpha-RBM4-eIF4E2 complex captures the 5' cap and targets mRNAs to polysomes for active translation, thereby evading hypoxia-induced repression of protein synthesis. These findings demonstrate that cells have evolved a program by which oxygen tension switches the basic translation initiation machinery.","Uniacke, James; Holterman, Chet E.; Lachance, Gabriel; Franovic, Aleksandra; Jacob, Mathieu D.; Fabian, Marc R.; Payette, Josianne; Holcik, Martin; Pause, Arnim; Lee, Stephen","Uniacke, J; Holterman, CE; Lachance, G; Franovic, A; Jacob, MD; Fabian, MR; Payette, J; Holcik, M; Pause, A; Lee, S",126.0,"[Uniacke, James; Holterman, Chet E.; Lachance, Gabriel; Franovic, Aleksandra; Jacob, Mathieu D.; Payette, Josianne; Lee, Stephen] Univ Ottawa, Fac Med, Dept Cellular & Mol Med, Ottawa, ON K1H 8M5, Canada; [Fabian, Marc R.; Pause, Arnim] McGill Univ, Dept Biochem, Goodman Canc Res Ctr, Montreal, PQ H3G 1Y6, Canada; [Holcik, Martin] Childrens Hosp Eastern Ontario, Res Inst, Apoptosis Res Ctr, Ottawa, ON K1H 8L1, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11055,Article,,slee@uottawa.ca,U154,Canadian Institutes of Health Research; Terry Fox Foundation (Canadian Cancer Society) [700014]; Terry Fox Foundation; Canadian Cancer Society,"We thank J.

68,15,383.0,"The reliable detection of single quantum particles has revolutionized the field of quantum optics and quantum information processing. For several years, researchers have aspired to extend such detection possibilities to larger-scale, strongly correlated quantum systems(1,2) in order to record in situ images of a quantum fluid in which each underlying quantum particle is detected. Here we report fluorescence imaging of strongly interacting bosonic Mott insulators in an optical lattice with single-atom and single-site resolution. From our images, we fully reconstruct the atom distribution on the lattice and identify individual excitations with high fidelity. A comparison of the radial density and variance distributions with theory provides a precise in situ temperature and entropy measurement from single images. We observe Mott-insulating plateaus with near-zero entropy and clearly resolve the high-entropy rings separating them, even though their width is of the order of just a single lattice site. Furthermore, we show how a Mott insulator melts with increasing temperature, owing to a proliferation of local defects. The ability to resolve individual lattice sites directly opens up new avenues for the manipulation, analysis and applications of strongly interacting quantum gases on a lattice. For example, one could introduce local perturbations or access regions of high entropy, a crucial requirement for the implementation of novel cooling schemes(3).","Sherson, Jacob F.; Weitenberg, Christof; Endres, Manuel; Cheneau, Marc; Bloch, Immanuel; Kuhr, Stefan","Sherson, JF; Weitenberg, C; Endres, M; Cheneau, M; Bloch, I; Kuhr, S",68.0,"[Sherson, Jacob F.; Weitenberg, Christof; Endres, Manuel; Cheneau, Marc; Bloch, Immanuel; Kuhr, Stefan] Max Planck Inst Quantum Opt, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Bloch, Immanuel] Univ Munich, D-80799 Munich, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09378,Article,,stefan.kuhr@mpq.mpg.de,U97,MPG; DFG; Stiftung Rheinland-Pfalz fur Innovation; Carl-Zeiss Stiftung; EU,"We thank R.

69,70,306.0,"DExD/H-box proteins are ubiquitously involved in RNA-mediated processes and use ATP to accelerate conformational changes in RNA. However, their mechanisms of action, and what determines which RNA species are targeted, are not well understood. Here we show that the DExD/H-box protein CYT-19, a general RNA chaperone, mediates ATP-dependent unfolding of both the native conformation and a long-lived misfolded conformation of a group I catalytic RNA with efficiencies that depend on the stabilities of the RNA species but not on specific structural features. CYT-19 then allows the RNA to refold, changing the distribution from equilibrium to kinetic control. Because misfolding is favoured kinetically, conditions that allow unfolding of the native RNA yield large increases in the population of misfolded species. Our results suggest that DExD/H-box proteins act with sufficient breadth and efficiency to allow structured RNAs to populate a wider range of conformations than would be present at equilibrium. Thus, RNAs may face selective pressure to stabilize their active conformations relative to inactive ones to avoid significant redistribution by DExD/H-box proteins. Conversely, RNAs whose functions depend on forming multiple conformations may rely on DExD/H-box proteins to increase the populations of less stable conformations, thereby increasing their overall efficiencies.","Bhaskaran, Hari; Russell, Rick","Bhaskaran, H; Russell, R",1014.0,"Univ Texas, Dept Chem & Biochem, Inst Mol & Cellular Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06235,Article,,rick_russell@mail.utexas.edu,U2,"NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM070456, R01 GM070456-04]",,223TK,,,GROUP-I INTRON; TETRAHYMENA RIBOZYME; PERIPHERAL ELEMENT; FOLDING LANDSCAPE; STRUCTURED RNA; PROTEIN; HELICASES; SEQUENCE; HELIX; INTERMEDIATE,7165.0,NATURE,Nature,English,48.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",25-Oct,6.0,LONDON,17960235.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007.0,"Russell, Rick/A-9256-2012","Russell, R (reprint author), Univ Texas, Dept Chem & Biochem, Inst Mol & Cellular Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,63.0,Kinetic redistribution of native and misfolded RNAs by a DEAD-box chaperone,1.0,5.0,WOS:000250395000043,306.0,449,Multidisciplinary Sciences,66,rick,russell,6545.0,1255,male,1.0,Hp4Ec54AAAAJ,3,"(4126, 9345]",38631296,1,399397,1,Chumlee,Chumlee,0,0
70,115,449.0,"The bacterial ubiD and ubiX or the homologous fungal fdc1 and pad1 genes have been implicated in the non-oxidative reversible decarboxylation of aromatic substrates, and play a pivotal role in bacterial ubiquinone (also known as coenzyme Q) biosynthesis(1-3) or microbial biodegradation of aromatic compounds(4-6), respectively. Despite biochemical studies on individual gene products, the composition and cofactor requirement of the enzyme responsible for in vivo decarboxylase activity remained unclear(7-9). Here we show that Fdc1 is solely responsible for the reversible decarboxylase activity, and that it requires a new type of cofactor: a prenylated flavin synthesized by the associated UbiX/Pad1(10). Atomic resolution crystal structures reveal that two distinct isomers of the oxidized cofactor can be observed, an isoalloxazine N5-iminium adduct and a N5 secondary ketimine species with markedly altered ring structure, both having azomethine ylide character. Substrate binding positions the dipolarophile enoic acid group directly above the azomethine ylide group. The structure of a covalent inhibitor-cofactor adduct suggests that 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition chemistry supports reversible decarboxylation in these enzymes. Although 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition is commonly used in organic chemistry(11,12), we propose that this presents the first example, to our knowledge, of an enzymatic 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction.

71,93,112.0,"DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are highly cytotoxic DNA lesions that trigger non-proteolytic ubiquitylation of adjacent chromatin areas to generate binding sites for DNA repair factors. This depends on the sequential actions of the E3 ubiquitin ligases RNF8 and RNF168 (refs 1-6), and UBC13 (also known as UBE2N), an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that specifically generates K63-linked ubiquitin chains(7). Whereas RNF168 is known to catalyse ubiquitylation of H2A-type histones, leading to the recruitment of repair factors such as 53BP1 (refs 8-10), the critical substrates of RNF8 and K63-linked ubiquitylation remain elusive. Here we elucidate how RNF8 and UBC13 promote recruitment of RNF168 and downstream factors to DSB sites in human cells. We establish that UBC13-dependent K63-linked ubiquitylation at DSB sites is predominantly mediated by RNF8 but not RNF168, and that H1-type linker histones, but not core histones, represent major chromatin-associated targets of this modification. The RNF168 module (UDM1) recognizing RNF8-generated ubiquitylations(11) is a high-affinity reader of K63-ubiquitylated H1, mechanistically explaining the essential roles of RNF8 and UBC13 in recruiting RNF168 to DSBs. Consistently, reduced expression or chromatin association of linker histones impair accumulation of K63-linked ubiquitin conjugates and repair factors at DSB-flanking chromatin.

72,210,197.0,"Catabolism may give rise to toxic intermediates that compromise cell vitality, such as epoxide formation in the recently elucidated and apparently universal bacterial coenzyme A (CoA)-dependent degradation of phenylacetic acid(1). This compound is central to the catabolism of a variety of aromatics, such as phenylalanine, lignin-related compounds or environmental contaminants(2,3). The key phenylacetyl-CoA monooxygenase (epoxidase) of the pathway, PaaABCE(1,4,5), is also connected to the production of various primary and secondary metabolites(6-9), as well as to the virulence of certain pathogens(1,10,11). However, the enzyme complex has so far not been investigated in detail. Here we characterize the bacterial multicomponent monooxygenase PaaABCE that, surprisingly, not only transforms phenylacetyl-CoA into its ring-1,2-epoxide, but also mediates the NADPH-dependent removal of the epoxide oxygen, regenerating phenylacetyl-CoA with formation of water. We provide evidence for a catalytic di-iron centre that is probably the key to the unprecedented deoxygenation of an organic compound by an oxygenase. Presumably, the bifunctionality is vital to avoid toxic intracellular epoxide levels if the subsequent catabolic steps are impeded. Our data suggest that detoxification is assisted by two thioesterases (PaaI and PaaY) forming non-reactive breakdown products. Hence, PaaABCE may harbour an intrinsic escape mechanism from its own toxic product and represents the archetype of a bifunctional oxygenase/deoxygenase. Analogous reactions may possibly be catalysed by other di-iron epoxidases.","Teufel, Robin; Friedrich, Thorsten; Fuchs, Georg","Teufel, R; Friedrich, T; Fuchs, G",359.0,"[Teufel, Robin; Fuchs, Georg] Univ Freiburg, Fak Biol, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Friedrich, Thorsten] Univ Freiburg, Fak Chem, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10862,Article,,georg.fuchs@biologie.uni-freiburg.de,U161,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft,"We thank Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft for support; V.

73,56,409.0,"There exists controversy over the nature of haematopoietic progenitors of T cells. Most T cells develop in the thymus, but the lineage potential of thymus-colonizing progenitors is unknown. One approach to resolving this question is to determine the lineage potentials of the earliest thymic progenitors (ETPs). Previous work has shown that ETPs possess T and natural killer lymphoid potentials, and rare subsets of ETPs also possess B lymphoid potential(1), suggesting an origin from lymphoid-restricted progenitor cells. However, whether ETPs also possess myeloid potential is unknown. Here we show that nearly all ETPs in adult mice possess both T and myeloid potential in clonal assays. The existence of progenitors possessing T and myeloid potential within the thymus is incompatible with the current dominant model of haematopoiesis, in which T cells are proposed to arise from lymphoid-restricted progenitors(2).

74,69,277.0,"An optical cavity enhances the interaction between atoms and light, and the rate of coherent atom-photon coupling can be made larger than all decoherence rates of the system. For single atoms, this 'strong coupling regime' of cavity quantum electrodynamics(1,2) has been the subject of many experimental advances. Efforts have been made to control the coupling rate by trapping(3,4) the atom and cooling(5,6) it towards the motional ground state; the latter has been achieved in one dimension so far(5). For systems of many atoms, the three-dimensional ground state of motion is routinely achieved(7) in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). Although experiments combining BECs and optical cavities have been reported recently(8,9), coupling BECs to cavities that are in the strong-coupling regime for single atoms has remained an elusive goal. Here we report such an experiment, made possible by combining a fibre-based cavity(10) with atom-chip technology(11). This enables single-atom cavity quantum electrodynamics experiments with a simplified set-up and realizes the situation of many atoms in a cavity, each of which is identically and strongly coupled to the cavity mode(12). Moreover, the BEC can be positioned deterministically anywhere within the cavity and localized entirely within a single antinode of the standing-wave cavity field; we demonstrate that this gives rise to a controlled, tunable coupling rate. We study the heating rate caused by a cavity transmission measurement as a function of the coupling rate and find no measurable heating for strongly coupled BECs. The spectrum of the coupled atoms-cavity system, which we map out over a wide range of atom numbers and cavity-atom detunings, shows vacuum Rabi splittings exceeding 20 gigahertz, as well as an unpredicted additional splitting, which we attribute to the atomic hyperfine structure. We anticipate that the system will be suitable as a light-matter quantum interface for quantum information(13).","Colombe, Yves; Steinmetz, Tilo; Dubois, Guilhem; Linke, Felix; Hunger, David; Reichel, Jakob","Colombe, Y; Steinmetz, T; Dubois, G; Linke, F; Hunger, D; Reichel, J",272.0,"Univ Paris 06, CNRS, ENS, Lab Kastler Brossel, F-75005 Paris, France; LMU, Max Planck Inst Quantenopt, D-80799 Munich, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06331,Article,,jakob.reichel@ens.fr,U9,,,228RC,Y,N,MAGNETIC MICROTRAPS; ULTRACOLD ATOMS; SINGLE ATOMS; LATTICES; PHOTONS; TRAPS,7167.0,NATURE,Nature,English,34.0,No,"Hunger, David/0000-0001-6156-6145; Reichel, Jakob/0000-0003-3420-4178","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",8-Nov,6.0,LONDON,17994094.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007.0,"Hunger, David/A-7673-2012","Reichel, J (reprint author), Univ Paris 06, CNRS, ENS, Lab Kastler Brossel, 24 Rue Lhomond, F-75005 Paris, France.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,434.0,Strong atom-field coupling for Bose-Einstein condensates in an optical cavity on a chip,4.0,53.0,WOS:000250746200055,277.0,450,Multidisciplinary Sciences,440,jakob,reichel,8184.0,148,male,0.99,EOrqDVAAAAAJ,3,"(4126, 9345]",38684068,1,174030,1,Jadup and Boel,Jadup and Boel,0,0
75,207,173.0,"The Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction approximately 66 million years ago is conventionally thought to have been a turning point in mammalian evolution(1,2). Prior to that event and for the first two-thirds of their evolutionary history, mammals were mostly confined to roles as generalized, small-bodied, nocturnal insectivores(3), presumably under selection pressures from dinosaurs(4). Release from these pressures, by extinction of non-avian dinosaurs at the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary, triggered ecological diversification of mammals(1,2). Although recent individual fossil discoveries have shown that some mammalian lineages diversified ecologically during the Mesozoic era(5), comprehensive ecological analyses of mammalian groups crossing the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary are lacking. Such analyses are needed because diversification analyses of living taxa(6,7) allow only indirect inferences of past ecosystems. Here we show that in arguably the most evolutionarily successful clade of Mesozoic mammals, the Multituberculata, an adaptive radiation began at least 20 million years before the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs and continued across the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary. Disparity in dental complexity, which relates to the range of diets, rose sharply in step with generic richness and disparity in body size. Moreover, maximum dental complexity and body size demonstrate an adaptive shift towards increased herbivory. This dietary expansion tracked the ecological rise of angiosperms(8) and suggests that the resources that were available to multituberculates were relatively unaffected by the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction. Taken together, our results indicate that mammals were able to take advantage of new ecological opportunities in the Mesozoic and that at least some of these opportunities persisted through the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction. Similar broad-scale ecomorphological inventories of other radiations may help to constrain the possible causes of mass extinctions(9,10).","Wilson, Gregory P.; Evans, Alistair R.; Corfe, Ian J.; Smits, Peter D.; Fortelius, Mikael; Jernvall, Jukka","Wilson, GP; Evans, AR; Corfe, IJ; Smits, PD; Fortelius, M; Jernvall, J",457.0,"[Wilson, Gregory P.; Smits, Peter D.] Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Evans, Alistair R.; Smits, Peter D.] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Corfe, Ian J.; Fortelius, Mikael; Jernvall, Jukka] Univ Helsinki, Inst Biotechnol, Dev Biol Program, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Fortelius, Mikael] Univ Helsinki, Dept Geosci & Geog, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10880,Article,,gpwilson@u.washington.edu,460,National Science Foundation; Denver Museum; University of Washington; Australian Research Council; Monash University; Academy of Finland; EU SYNTHESYS [GB-TAF-4779],"We thank museums, institutions and individuals that made specimens available for this study (full list is available in Supplementary Information).

76,117,460.0,"Mutations or amplification of the MET proto-oncogene are involved in the pathogenesis of several tumours(1-4), which rely on the constitutive engagement of this pathway for their growth and survival(1,5). However, MET is expressed not only by cancer cells but also by tumour-associated stromal cells, although its precise role in this compartment is not well characterized(6-11). Here we show that MET is required for neutrophil chemoattraction and cytotoxicity in response to its ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Met deletion in mouse neutrophils enhances tumour growth and metastasis. This phenotype correlates with reduced neutrophil infiltration to both the primary tumour and metastatic sites. Similarly, Met is necessary for neutrophil transudation during colitis, skin rash or peritonitis. Mechanistically, Met is induced by tumour-derived tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha or other inflammatory stimuli in both mouse and human neutrophils. This induction is instrumental for neutrophil transmigration across an activated endothelium and for inducible nitric oxide synthase production upon HGF stimulation. Consequently, HGF/MET-dependent nitric oxide release by neutrophils promotes cancer cell killing, which abates tumour growth and metastasis. After systemic administration of a MET kinase inhibitor, we prove that the therapeutic benefit of MET targeting in cancer cells is partly countered by the pro-tumoural effect arising from MET blockade in neutrophils. Our work identifies an unprecedented role of MET in neutrophils, suggests a potential 'Achilles' heel' of MET-targeted therapies in cancer, and supports the rationale for evaluating anti-MET drugs in certain inflammatory diseases.","Finisguerra, Veronica; Di Conza, Giusy; Di Matteo, Mario; Serneels, Jens; Costa, Sandra; Thompson, A.

77,3,53.0,"Thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) is a member of the uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) superfamily of DNA repair enzymes. Owing to its ability to excise thymine when mispaired with guanine, it was proposed to act against the mutability of 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) deamination in mammalian DNA(1). However, TDG was also found to interact with transcription factors(2,3), histone acetyltransferases(4) and de novo DNA methyltransferases(5,6), and it has been associated with DNA demethylation in gene promoters following activation of transcription(7-9), altogether implicating an engagement in gene regulation rather than DNA repair. Here we use a mouse genetic approach to determine the biological function of this multifaceted DNA repair enzyme. We find that, unlike other DNA glycosylases, TDG is essential for embryonic development, and that this phenotype is associated with epigenetic aberrations affecting the expression of developmental genes. Fibroblasts derived from Tdg null embryos (mouse embryonic fibroblasts, MEFs) show impaired gene regulation, coincident with imbalanced histone modification and CpG methylation at promoters of affected genes. TDG associates with the promoters of such genes both in fibroblasts and in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), but epigenetic aberrations only appear upon cell lineage commitment. We show that TDG contributes to the maintenance of active and bivalent chromatin throughout cell differentiation, facilitating a proper assembly of chromatin-modifying complexes and initiating base excision repair to counter aberrant de novo methylation. We thus conclude that TDG-dependent DNA repair has evolved to provide epigenetic stability in lineage committed cells.","Cortazar, Daniel; Kunz, Christophe; Selfridge, Jim; Lettieri, Teresa; Saito, Yusuke; MacDougall, Eilidh; Wirz, Annika; Schuermann, David; Jacobs, Angelika L.; Siegrist, Fredy; Steinacher, Roland; Jiricny, Josef; Bird, Adrian; Schaer, Primo","Cortazar, D; Kunz, C; Selfridge, J; Lettieri, T; Saito, Y; MacDougall, E; Wirz, A; Schuermann, D; Jacobs, AL; Siegrist, F; Steinacher, R; Jiricny, J; Bird, A; Schar, P",419.0,"[Cortazar, Daniel; Kunz, Christophe; Saito, Yusuke; Wirz, Annika; Schuermann, David; Jacobs, Angelika L.; Steinacher, Roland; Schaer, Primo] Univ Basel, Inst Biochem & Genet, Dept Biomed, CH-4048 Basel, Switzerland; [Selfridge, Jim; MacDougall, Eilidh; Bird, Adrian] Univ Edinburgh, Wellcome Trust Ctr Cell Biol, Edinburgh EH9 3JR, Midlothian, Scotland; [Lettieri, Teresa; Jiricny, Josef] Univ Zurich, Inst Mol Canc Res, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Siegrist, Fredy] F Hoffmann La Roche Ltd, Global Preclin Safety, Pharmaceut Res, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09672,Article,,primo.schaer@unibas.ch,U210,"Swiss National Science Foundation [3100A0-108436, 3100A0-122574/]; Association For International Cancer Research [01-330]","We thank D.

79,153,323.0,"The El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) drives substantial variability in rainfall(1-3), severe weather(4,5), agricultural production(3,6), ecosystems(7) and disease(8) in many parts of the world. Given that further human-forced changes in the Earth's climate system seem inevitable(9,10), the possibility exists that the character of ENSO and its impacts might change over the coming century. Although this issue has been investigated many times during the past 20 years, there is very little consensus on future changes in ENSO, apart from an expectation that ENSO will continue to be a dominant source of year-to-year variability(9,11,12). Here we show that there are in fact robust projected changes in the spatial patterns of year-to-year ENSO-driven variability in both surface temperature and precipitation. These changes are evident in the two most recent generations of climate models(13,14), using four different scenarios for CO2 and other radiatively active gases(14-17). By the mid- to late twenty-first century, the projections include an intensification of both El-Nino-driven drying in the western Pacific Ocean and rainfall increases in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific. Experiments with an Atmospheric General Circulation Model reveal that robust projected changes in precipitation anomalies during El Nino years are primarily determined by a nonlinear response to surface global warming. Uncertain projected changes in the amplitude of ENSO-driven surface temperature variability have only a secondary role. Projected changes in key characteristics of ENSO are consequently much clearer than previously realized.","Power, Scott; Delage, Francois; Chung, Christine; Kociuba, Greg; Keay, Kevin","Power, S; Delage, F; Chung, C; Kociuba, G; Keay, K",541.0,"[Power, Scott; Delage, Francois; Chung, Christine; Kociuba, Greg; Keay, Kevin] Bur Meteorol, Ctr Australian Weather & Climate Res, Melbourne, Vic 3008, Australia",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12580,Article,1476-4687,s.power@bom.gov.au,+,"Australian Climate Change Science Program (ACCSP); Pacific-Australia Climate Change Science and Adaptation planning Program (PACCSAP); AusAID; Department of Industry, Innovation, Climate Change, Science, Research and Tertiary Education","We thank L.

80,1,24.0,"Volcanic tremor is a ubiquitous feature of explosive eruptions. This oscillation persists for minutes to weeks and is characterized by a remarkably narrow band of frequencies from about 0.5 Hz to 7 Hz (refs 1-4). Before major eruptions, tremor can occur in concert with increased gas flux and related ground deformation(5-7). Volcanic tremor is thus of particular value for eruption forecasting(6,8). Most models for volcanic tremor rely on specific properties of the geometry, structure and constitution of volcanic conduits as well as the gas content of the erupting magma. Because neither the initial structure nor the evolution of the magma-conduit system will be the same from one volcano to the next, it is surprising that tremor characteristics are so consistent among different volcanoes. Indeed, this universality of tremor properties remains a major enigma. Here we employ the contemporary view that silicic magma rises in the conduit as a columnar plug surrounded by a highly vesicular annulus of sheared bubbles(9,10). We demonstrate that, for most geologically relevant conditions, the magma column will oscillate or 'wag' against the restoring 'gas-spring' force of the annulus at observed tremor frequencies. In contrast to previous models, the magma-wagging oscillation is relatively insensitive to the conduit structure and geometry, which explains the narrow band of tremor frequencies observed around the world. Moreover, the model predicts that as an eruption proceeds there will be an upward drift in both the maximum frequency and the total signal frequency bandwidth, the nature of which depends on the explosivity of the eruption, as is often observed.","Jellinek, A.

81,100,226.0,"Nuclear pore complexes are fundamental components of all eukaryotic cells that mediate nucleocytoplasmic exchange. Determining their 110-megadalton structure imposes a formidable challenge and requires in situ structural biology approaches. Of approximately 30 nucleoporins (Nups), 15 are structured and form the Y and innerring complexes. These two major scaffolding modules assemble in multiple copies into an eight-fold rotationally symmetric structure that fuses the inner and outer nuclear membranes to forma central channel of similar to 60 nm in diameter(1). The scaffold is decorated with transport-channel Nups that often contain phenylalanine-repeat sequences and mediate the interaction with cargo complexes. Although the architectural arrangement of parts of the Y complex has been elucidated, it is unclear how exactly it oligomerizes in situ. Here we combine cryo-electron tomography with mass spectrometry, biochemical analysis, perturbation experiments and structural modelling to generate, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive architectural model of the human nuclear pore complex to date. Our data suggest previously unknown protein interfaces across Y complexes and to inner-ring complex members. We show that the transport-channel Nup358 (also known as Ranbp2) has a previously unanticipated role in Y-complex oligomerization. Our findings blur the established boundaries between scaffold and transport-channel Nups. We conclude that, similar to coated vesicles, several copies of the same structural building block-although compositionally identical-engage in different local sets of interactions and conformations.","von Appen, Alexander; Kosinski, Jan; Sparks, Lenore; Ori, Alessandro; DiGuilio, Amanda L.; Vollmer, Benjamin; Mackmull, Marie-Therese; Banterle, Niccolo; Parca, Luca; Kastritis, Panagiotis; Buczak, Katarzyna; Mosalaganti, Shyamal; Hagen, Wim; Andres-Pons, Amparo; Lemke, Edward A.; Bork, Peer; Antonin, Wolfram; Glavy, Joseph S.; Bui, Khanh Huy; Beck, Martin","von Appen, A; Kosinski, J; Sparks, L; Ori, A; DiGuilio, AL; Vollmer, B; Mackmull, MT; Banterle, N; Parca, L; Kastritis, P; Buczak, K; Mosalaganti, S; Hagen, W; Andres-Pons, A; Lemke, EA; Bork, P; Antonin, W; Glavy, JS; Bui, KH; Beck, M",140.0,"[von Appen, Alexander; Kosinski, Jan; Sparks, Lenore; Ori, Alessandro; Mackmull, Marie-Therese; Banterle, Niccolo; Parca, Luca; Kastritis, Panagiotis; Buczak, Katarzyna; Mosalaganti, Shyamal; Hagen, Wim; Andres-Pons, Amparo; Lemke, Edward A.; Bork, Peer; Bui, Khanh Huy; Beck, Martin] European Mol Biol Lab, Struct & Computat Biol Unit, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [DiGuilio, Amanda L.; Glavy, Joseph S.] Stevens Inst Technol, Dept Chem Chem Biol & Biomed Engn, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA; [Vollmer, Benjamin; Antonin, Wolfram] Max Planck Gesell, Friedrich Miescher Lab, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Bui, Khanh Huy] McGill Univ, Dept Anat & Cell Biol, Montreal, PQ H3A 0C7, Canada",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15381,Article,1476-4687,huy.bui@mcgill.ca; martin.beck@embl.de,+,EMBL's mechanical workshop; Electron Microscopy and Proteomics Core Facilities; Centre for Statistical Data Analysis; Swiss National Science Foundation; European Molecular Biology Organization; Marie Curie Actions; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation; Robert Crooks Stanley Fellowship at the Stevens Institute of Technology; National Institute on Aging (NIA) [1R21AG047433-01]; EMBL Interdisciplinary Postdoc Programme under Marie Curie COFUND Actions; Ignition Grant Initiative from Stevens Institute of Technology; NIA [1R21AG047433-01]; EMBL; European Research Council [309271-NPCAtlas],"We are grateful to W.

82,142,32.0,"Historically, the study of speech processing has emphasized a strong link between auditory perceptual input and motor production output(1-4). A kind of 'parity' is essential, as both perception-and production-based representations must form a unified interface to facilitate access to higher-order language processes such as syntax and semantics, believed to be computed in the dominant, typically left hemisphere(5,6). Although various theories have been proposed to unite perception and production(2,7), the underlying neural mechanisms are unclear. Early models of speech and language processing proposed that perceptual processing occurred in the left posterior superior temporal gyrus (Wernicke's area) and motor production processes occurred in the left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's area)(8,9). Sensory activity was proposed to link to production activity through connecting fibre tracts, forming the left lateralized speech sensory-motor system(10). Although recent evidence indicates that speech perception occurs bilaterally(11-13), prevailing models maintain that the speech sensory-motor system is left lateralized(11,14-18) and facilitates the transformation from sensory-based auditory representations to motor-based production representations(11,15,16). However, evidence for the lateralized computation of sensory-motor speech transformations is indirect and primarily comes from stroke patients that have speech repetition deficits (conduction aphasia) and studies using covert speech and haemodynamic functional imaging(16,19). Whether the speech sensory-motor system is lateralized, like higher-order language processes, or bilateral, like speech perception, is controversial. Here we use direct neural recordings in subjects performing sensory-motor tasks involving overt speech production to show that sensory-motor transformations occur bilaterally. We demonstrate that electrodes over bilateral inferior frontal, inferior parietal, superior temporal, premotor and somatosensory cortices exhibit robust sensory-motor neural responses during both perception and production in an overt word-repetition task. Using a non-word transformation task, we show that bilateral sensory-motor responses can perform transformations between speech-perception-and speech-production-based representations. These results establish a bilateral sublexical speech sensory-motor system.","Cogan, Gregory B.; Thesen, Thomas; Carlson, Chad; Doyle, Werner; Devinsky, Orrin; Pesaran, Bijan","Cogan, GB; Thesen, T; Carlson, C; Doyle, W; Devinsky, O; Pesaran, B",94.0,"[Cogan, Gregory B.; Pesaran, Bijan] NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Thesen, Thomas; Carlson, Chad; Devinsky, Orrin] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Doyle, Werner; Devinsky, Orrin] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Neurosurg, New York, NY 10016 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12935,Article,1476-4687,bijan@nyu.edu,+,NIDCD [R03-DC010475]; Burroughs Wellcome Fund; NYSTAR; McKnight Scholar Award; Sloan Research Fellowship,"We would like to thank A.

83,112,403.0,"During bacterial growth, a cell approximately doubles in size before division, after which it splits into two daughter cells. This process is subjected to the inherent perturbations of cellular noise(1,2) and thus requires regulation for cell-size homeostasis. The mechanisms underlying the control and dynamics of cell size remain poorly understood owing to the difficulty in sizing individual bacteria over long periods of time in a high-throughput manner. Here we measure and analyse long-term, single-cell growth and division across different Escherichia coli strains and growth conditions(3). We show that a subset of cells in a population exhibit transient oscillations in cell size with periods that stretch across several (more than ten) generations. Our analysis reveals that a simple law governing cell-size control-a noisy linear map-explains the origins of these cell-size oscillations across all strains. This noisy linear map implements a negative feedback on cell-size control: a cell with a larger initial size tends to divide earlier, whereas one with a smaller initial size tends to divide later. Combining simulations of cell growth and division with experimental data, we demonstrate that this noisy linear map generates transient oscillations, not just in cell size, but also in constitutive gene expression. Our work provides new insights into the dynamics of bacterial cell-size regulation with implications for the physiological processes involved.","Tanouchi, Yu; Pai, Anand; Park, Heungwon; Huang, Shuqiang; Stamatov, Rumen; Buchler, Nicolas E.; You, Lingchong","Tanouchi, Y; Pai, A; Park, H; Huang, SQ; Stamatov, R; Buchler, NE; You, LC",357.0,"[Tanouchi, Yu; Pai, Anand; Huang, Shuqiang; You, Lingchong] Duke Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Park, Heungwon; Buchler, Nicolas E.] Duke Univ, Dept Phys, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Park, Heungwon; Buchler, Nicolas E.] Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Stamatov, Rumen] Duke Univ, Computat Biol & Bioinformat, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Buchler, Nicolas E.; You, Lingchong] Duke Univ, Ctr Genom & Computat Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14562,Article,1476-4687,you@duke.edu,+,"National Science Foundation; National Institutes of Health [R01GM098642, R01GM110494]; DuPont Young Professorship; David and Lucile Packard Fellowship; DARPA Biochronicity Grant [DARPA-BAA-11-66]; NIH [DP2 OD008654-01]; Burroughs Wellcome Fund [BWF 1005769.01]","We thank S.

84,154,346.0,"Nucleic-acid-binding proteins are generally viewed as either specific or nonspecific, depending on characteristics of their binding sites in DNA or RNA(1,2). Most studies have focused on specific proteins, which identify cognate sites by binding with highest affinities to regions with defined signatures in sequence, structure or both(1-4). Proteins that bind to sites devoid of defined sequence or structure signatures are considered nonspecific(1,2,5). Substrate binding by these proteins is poorly understood, and it is not known to what extent seemingly nonspecific proteins discriminate between different binding sites, aside from those sequestered by nucleic acid structures(6). Here we systematically examine substrate binding by the apparently nonspecific RNA-binding protein C5, and find clear discrimination between different binding site variants. C5 is the protein subunit of the transfer RNA processing ribonucleoprotein enzyme RNase P from Escherichia coli. The protein binds 59 leaders of precursor tRNAs at a site without sequence or structure signatures. We measure functional binding of C5 to all possible sequence variants in its substrate binding site, using a high-throughput sequencing kinetics approach (HITS-KIN) that simultaneously follows processing of thousands of RNA species. C5 binds different substrate variants with affinities varying by orders of magnitude. The distribution of functional affinities of C5 for all substrate variants resembles affinity distributions of highly specific nucleic acid binding proteins. Unlike these specific proteins, C5 does not bind its physiological RNA targets with the highest affinity, but with affinities near the median of the distribution, a region that is not associated with a sequence signature. We delineate defined rules governing substrate recognition by C5, which reveal specificity that is hidden in cellular substrates for RNase P. Our findings suggest that apparently nonspecific and specific RNA-binding modes may not differ fundamentally, but represent distinct parts of common affinity distributions.","Guenther, Ulf-Peter; Yandek, Lindsay E.; Niland, Courtney N.; Campbell, Frank E.; Anderson, David; Anderson, Vernon E.; Harris, Michael E.; Jankowsky, Eckhard","Guenther, UP; Yandek, LE; Niland, CN; Campbell, FE; Anderson, D; Anderson, VE; Harris, ME; Jankowsky, E",385.0,"[Guenther, Ulf-Peter; Campbell, Frank E.; Jankowsky, Eckhard] Case Western Reserve Univ, Ctr RNA Mol Biol, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Guenther, Ulf-Peter; Yandek, Lindsay E.; Niland, Courtney N.; Anderson, Vernon E.; Harris, Michael E.; Jankowsky, Eckhard] Case Western Reserve Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Anderson, David] CUNY, Baruch Coll, Zicklin Sch Business, Dept Management, New York, NY 10010 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12543,Article,1476-4687,meh2@case.edu; exj13@case.edu,+,"US National Institutes of Health (NIH) [GM067700, GM099720, CSTA UL1RR024989, GM056740, GM096000, T32 GM008056]; DFG","We particularly thank T.

85,118,496.0,"Jets of highly energized plasma with relativistic velocities are associated with black holes ranging in mass from a few times that of the Sun to the billion-solar-mass black holes at the centres of galaxies(1). A popular but unconfirmed hypothesis to explain how the plasma is energized is the 'internal shock model', in which the relativistic flow is unsteady(2). Faster components in the jet catch up to and collide with slower ones, leading to internal shocks that accelerate particles and generate magnetic fields(3). This mechanism can explain the variable, high-energy emission from a diverse set of objects(4-7), with the best indirect evidence being the unseen fast relativistic flow inferred to energize slower components in X-ray binary jets(8,9). Mapping of the kinematic profiles in resolved jets has revealed precessing and helical patterns in X-ray binaries(10,11), apparent superluminal motions(12,13), and the ejection of knots (bright components) from standing shocks in the jets of active galaxies(14,15). Observations revealing the structure and evolution of an internal shock in action have, however, remained elusive, hindering measurement of the physical parameters and ultimate efficiency of the mechanism. Here we report observations of a collision between two knots in the jet of nearby radio galaxy 3C 264. Abright knot with an apparent speed of (7.0 +/- 0.8)c, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum, is in the incipient stages of a collision with a slower-moving knot of speed (1.8 +/- 0.5)c just downstream, resulting in brightening of both knots-as seen in the most recent epoch of imaging.","Meyer, Eileen T.; Georganopoulos, Markos; Sparks, William B.; Perlman, Eric; van der Marel, Roeland P.; Anderson, Jay; Sohn, Sangmo Tony; Biretta, John; Norman, Colin; Chiaberge, Marco","Meyer, ET; Georganopoulos, M; Sparks, WB; Perlman, E; van der Marel, RP; Anderson, J; Sohn, ST; Biretta, J; Norman, C; Chiaberge, M",495.0,"[Meyer, Eileen T.; Sparks, William B.; van der Marel, Roeland P.; Anderson, Jay; Biretta, John; Norman, Colin; Chiaberge, Marco] Space Telescope Sci Inst, 3700 San Martin Dr, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Meyer, Eileen T.; Georganopoulos, Markos] Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Baltimore, MD 21250 USA; [Georganopoulos, Markos] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Perlman, Eric] Florida Inst Technol, Melbourne, FL 32901 USA; [Sohn, Sangmo Tony; Norman, Colin; Chiaberge, Marco] Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Chiaberge, Marco] Ist Radio Astron, Ist Nazl Astrofis, I-40129 Bologna, Italy",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14481,Article,1476-4687,eileen.meyer@gmail.com,+,HST [GO-13327],E.T.M. acknowledges HST grant GO-13327.,DF8BN,,,GAMMA-RAY BURSTS; HUBBLE-SPACE-TELESCOPE; M87 JET; 3C 264; EMISSION; MOTION; MODEL,7553.0,NATURE,Nature,English,28.0,No,"van der Marel, Roeland/0000-0001-7827-7825; Norman, Colin/0000-0002-5222-5717","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",28-May,13.0,LONDON,26017450.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2015.0,,"Meyer, ET (reprint author), Space Telescope Sci Inst, 3700 San Martin Dr, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,6.0,A kiloparsec-scale internal shock collision in the jet of a nearby radio galaxy,2.0,5.0,WOS:000371582000002,496.0,521,Multidisciplinary Sciences,6,marco,chiaberge,4640.0,2493,male,0.99,_UA9uSEAAAAJ,3,"(4126, 9345]",48666263,1,na,0,NGC 4293,na,0,0
86,114,430.0,"Cells sense the context in which they grow to adapt their phenotype and allow multicellular patterning by mechanisms of autocrine and paracrine signalling(1,2). However, patterns also form in cell populations exposed to the same signalling molecules and substratum, which often correlate with specific features of the population context of single cells, such as local cell crowding(3). Here we reveal a cell-intrinsic molecular mechanism that allows multicellular patterning without requiring specific communication between cells. It acts by sensing the local crowding of a single cell through its ability to spread and activate focal adhesion kinase (FAK, also known as PTK2), resulting in adaptation of genes controlling membrane homeostasis. In cells experiencing low crowding, FAK suppresses transcription of the ABC transporter A1 (ABCA1) by inhibiting FOXO3 and TAL1. Agent-based computational modelling and experimental confirmation identified membrane-based signalling and feedback control as crucial for the emergence of population patterns of ABCA1 expression, which adapts membrane lipid composition to cell crowding and affects multiple signalling activities, including the suppression of ABCA1 expression itself. The simple design of this cell-intrinsic system and its broad impact on the signalling state of mammalian single cells suggests a fundamental role for a tunable membrane lipid composition in collective cell behaviour.","Frechin, Mathieu; Stoeger, Thomas; Daetwyler, Stephan; Gehin, Charlotte; Battich, Nico; Damm, Eva-Maria; Stergiou, Lilli; Riezman, Howard; Pelkmans, Lucas","Frechin, M; Stoeger, T; Daetwyler, S; Gehin, C; Battich, N; Damm, EM; Stergiou, L; Riezman, H; Pelkmans, L",88.0,"[Frechin, Mathieu; Stoeger, Thomas; Daetwyler, Stephan; Battich, Nico; Pelkmans, Lucas] Univ Zurich, Inst Mol Life Sci, Fac Sci, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Stoeger, Thomas; Battich, Nico] ETH, Life Sci Zurich Grad Sch, PhD Program Syst Biol, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Stoeger, Thomas; Battich, Nico] Univ Zurich, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Gehin, Charlotte; Riezman, Howard] Univ Geneva, Dept Biochem, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland; [Damm, Eva-Maria; Stergiou, Lilli] ETH, Inst Mol Syst Biol, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14429,Article,1476-4687,lucas.pelkmans@imls.uzh.ch,+,EMBO; Marie Curie fellowship [301650]; Oncosuisse fellowship; Bonizzi Theler fellowship; University of Zurich; SystemsX.ch RTD Project LipidX,"We thank B.

87,127,284.0,"The transfer of somatic cell nuclei into oocytes can give rise to pluripotent stem cells that are consistently equivalent to embryonic stem cells(1-3), holding promise for autologous cell replacement therapy(4,5). Although methods to induce pluripotent stem cells from somatic cells by transcription factors(6) are widely used in basic research, numerous differences between induced pluripotent stem cells and embryonic stem cells have been reported(7-11), potentially affecting their clinical use. Because of the therapeutic potential of diploid embryonic stem-cell lines derived from adult cells of diseased human subjects, we have systematically investigated the parameters affecting efficiency of blastocyst development and stem-cell derivation. Here we show that improvements to the oocyte activation protocol, including the use of both kinase and translation inhibitors, and cell culture in the presence of histone deacetylase inhibitors, promote development to the blastocyst stage. Developmental efficiency varied between oocyte donors, and was inversely related to the number of days of hormonal stimulation required for oocyte maturation, whereas the daily dose of gonadotropin or the total number of metaphase II oocytes retrieved did not affect developmental outcome. Because the use of concentrated Sendai virus for cell fusion induced an increase in intracellular calcium concentration, causing premature oocyte activation, we used diluted Sendai virus in calcium-free medium. Using this modified nuclear transfer protocol, we derived diploid pluripotent stem-cell lines from somatic cells of a newborn and, for the first time, an adult, a female with type 1 diabetes.","Yamada, Mitsutoshi; Johannesson, Bjarki; Sagi, Ido; Burnett, Lisa Cole; Kort, Daniel H.; Prosser, Robert W.; Paull, Daniel; Nestor, Michael W.; Freeby, Matthew; Greenberg, Ellen; Goland, Robin S.; Leibel, Rudolph L.; Solomon, Susan L.; Benvenisty, Nissim; Sauer, Mark V.; Egli, Dieter","Yamada, M; Johannesson, B; Sagi, I; Burnett, LC; Kort, DH; Prosser, RW; Paull, D; Nestor, MW; Freeby, M; Greenberg, E; Goland, RS; Leibel, RL; Solomon, SL; Benvenisty, N; Sauer, MV; Egli, D",533.0,"[Yamada, Mitsutoshi; Johannesson, Bjarki; Paull, Daniel; Nestor, Michael W.; Solomon, Susan L.; Egli, Dieter] New York Stem Cell Fdn Res Inst, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Sagi, Ido; Benvenisty, Nissim] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Silberman Inst Life Sci, Dept Genet, Stem Cell Unit, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel; [Burnett, Lisa Cole; Freeby, Matthew; Greenberg, Ellen; Goland, Robin S.; Leibel, Rudolph L.] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Pediat, Naomi Berrie Diabet Ctr, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Kort, Daniel H.; Prosser, Robert W.; Sauer, Mark V.] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Ctr Womens Reprod Care, New York, NY 10019 USA; [Kort, Daniel H.; Prosser, Robert W.; Sauer, Mark V.] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, New York, NY 10019 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13287,Article,1476-4687,d.egli@nyscf.org,+,New York Stem Cell Foundation (NYSCF); New York State Stem Cell Science (NYSTEM) IIRP [C026184]; Russell Berrie Foundation Program in Cellular Therapies of Diabetes,"This research was supported the New York Stem Cell Foundation (NYSCF) and a New York State Stem Cell Science (NYSTEM) IIRP Award no.

88,38,55.0,"Biosynthesis of the DNA base thymine depends on activity of the enzyme thymidylate synthase to catalyse the methylation of the uracil moiety of 2'-deoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate. All known thymidylate synthases rely on an active site residue of the enzyme to activate 2'-deoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate(1,2). This functionality has been demonstrated for classical thymidylate synthases, including human thymidylate synthase, and is instrumental in mechanism-based inhibition of these enzymes. Here we report an example of thymidylate biosynthesis that occurs without an enzymatic nucleophile. This unusual biosynthetic pathway occurs in organisms containing the thyX gene, which codes for a flavin-dependent thymidylate synthase (FDTS), and is present in several human pathogens(3-5). Our findings indicate that the putative active site nucleophile is not required for FDTS catalysis, and no alternative nucleophilic residues capable of serving this function can be identified. Instead, our findings suggest that a hydride equivalent (that is, a proton and two electrons) is transferred from the reduced flavin cofactor directly to the uracil ring, followed by an isomerization of the intermediate to form the product, 2'-deoxythymidine-5'-monophosphate. These observations indicate a very different chemical cascade than that of classical thymidylate synthases or any other known biological methylation. The findings and chemical mechanism proposed here, together with available structural data, suggest that selective inhibition of FDTSs, with little effect on human thymine biosynthesis, should be feasible. Because several human pathogens depend on FDTS for DNA biosynthesis, its unique mechanism makes it an attractive target for antibiotic drugs.","Koehn, Eric M.; Fleischmann, Todd; Conrad, John A.; Palfey, Bruce A.; Lesley, Scott A.; Mathews, Irimpan I.; Kohen, Amnon","Koehn, EM; Fleischmann, T; Conrad, JA; Palfey, BA; Lesley, SA; Mathews, II; Kohen, A",919.0,"[Koehn, Eric M.; Fleischmann, Todd; Kohen, Amnon] Univ Iowa, Dept Chem, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Conrad, John A.; Palfey, Bruce A.] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Lesley, Scott A.] Novartis Res Fdn, Genom Inst, Joint Ctr Struct Genom, San Diego, CA 92121 USA; [Mathews, Irimpan I.] Stanford Univ, Stanford Synchrotron Radiat Lab, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07973,Article,,amnon-kohen@uiowa.edu,U13,"NIH [R01 GM065368, R01 GM61087, GM08270]; NSF [CHE 0715448]; JCSG [U54GM074898]; DOE; OBER; NCRR; NIGMS","This work was supported by NIH R01 GM065368 and NSF CHE 0715448 to A.

89,21,7.0,"Deep tremor in subduction zones is thought to be caused by small repeating shear slip events on the plate interface with significant slow components(1-4). It occurs at a depth of about 30 kilometres and provides valuable information on deep plate motion and shallow stress accumulation on the fault plane of megathrust earthquakes. Tremor has been suggested to repeat at a regular interval(1,2), migrate at various velocities(4-7) and be modulated by tidal stress(6,8,9). Here I show that some time-invariant interface property controls tremor behaviour, using precise location of tremor sources with event duration in western Shikoku in the Nankai subduction zone, Japan. In areas where tremor duration is short, tremor is more strongly affected by tidal stress and migration is inhibited. Where tremor lasts longer, diffusive migration occurs with a constant diffusivity of 10(4) m(2) s(-1). The control property may be the ratio of brittle to ductile areas, perhaps determined by the influence of mantle wedge serpentinization on the plate interface. The spatial variation of the controlling property seems to be characterized by striations in tremor source distribution, which follows either the current or previous plate subduction directions. This suggests that the striations and corresponding interface properties are formed through the subduction of inhomogeneous structure, such as seamounts, for periods as long as ten million years.","Ide, Satoshi","Ide, S",356.0,"Univ Tokyo, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09251,Article,1476-4687,ide@eps.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp,U105,JSPS [20340115]; MEXT [21107007],"I thank G.

90,101,239.0,"Following the discovery of BRD4 as a non-oncogene addiction target in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)(1,2), bromodomain and extra terminal protein (BET) inhibitors are being explored as a promising therapeutic avenue in numerous cancers(3-5). While clinical trials have reported single-agent activity in advanced haematological malignancies(6), mechanisms determining the response to BET inhibition remain poorly understood. To identify factors involved in primary and acquired BET resistance in leukaemia, here we perform a chromatin-focused RNAi screen in a sensitive MLL-AF9; Nras(G12D)-driven AML mouse model, and investigate dynamic transcriptional profiles in sensitive and resistantmouse and human leukaemias. Our screen shows that suppression of the PRC2 complex, contrary to effects in other contexts, promotes BET inhibitor resistance in AML. PRC2 suppression does not directly affect the regulation of Brd4-dependent transcripts, but facilitates the remodelling of regulatory pathways that restore the transcription of key targets such as Myc. Similarly, while BET inhibition triggers acute MYC repression in human leukaemias regardless of their sensitivity, resistant leukaemias are uniformly characterized by their ability to rapidly restore MYC transcription. This process involves the activation and recruitment of WNT signalling components, which compensate for the loss of BRD4 and drive resistance in various cancer models. Dynamic chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing of enhancer profiles reveal that BET-resistant states are characterized by remodelled regulatory landscapes, involving the activation of a focal MYC enhancer that recruits WNT machinery in response to BET inhibition. Together, our results identify and validate WNT signalling as a driver and candidate biomarker of primary and acquired BET resistance in leukaemia, and implicate the rewiring of transcriptional programs as an important mechanism promoting resistance to BET inhibitors and, potentially, other chromatin-targeted therapies.","Rathert, Philipp; Roth, Mareike; Neumann, Tobias; Muerdter, Felix; Roe, Jae-Seok; Muhar, Matthias; Deswal, Sumit; Cerny-Reiterer, Sabine; Peter, Barbara; Jude, Julian; Hoffmann, Thomas; Boryn, Lukasz M.; Axelsson, Elin; Schweifer, Norbert; Tontsch-Grunt, Ulrike; Dow, Lukas E.; Gianni, Davide; Pearson, Mark; Valent, Peter; Stark, Alexander; Kraut, Norbert; Vakoc, Christopher R.; Zuber, Johannes","Rathert, P; Roth, M; Neumann, T; Muerdter, F; Roe, JS; Muhar, M; Deswal, S; Cerny-Reiterer, S; Peter, B; Jude, J; Hoffmann, T; Boryn, LM; Axelsson, E; Schweifer, N; Tontsch-Grunt, U; Dow, LE; Gianni, D; Pearson, M; Valent, P; Stark, A; Kraut, N; Vakoc, CR; Zuber, J",543.0,"[Rathert, Philipp; Roth, Mareike; Neumann, Tobias; Muerdter, Felix; Muhar, Matthias; Deswal, Sumit; Jude, Julian; Hoffmann, Thomas; Boryn, Lukasz M.; Axelsson, Elin; Stark, Alexander; Zuber, Johannes] Vienna Bioctr VBC, Res Inst Mol Pathol IMP, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Roe, Jae-Seok; Vakoc, Christopher R.] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; [Cerny-Reiterer, Sabine; Peter, Barbara; Valent, Peter] Med Univ Vienna, Div Hematol & Hemostaseol, Dept Internal Med 1, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Cerny-Reiterer, Sabine; Peter, Barbara; Valent, Peter] Med Univ Vienna, Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncol, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Schweifer, Norbert; Tontsch-Grunt, Ulrike; Gianni, Davide; Pearson, Mark; Kraut, Norbert] Boehringer Ingelheim Reg Ctr Vienna GmbH, A-1121 Vienna, Austria; [Dow, Lukas E.] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Med Hematol & Med Oncol, New York, NY 10065 USA",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14898,Article,1476-4687,zuber@imp.ac.at,+,"European Research Council (ERC) [336860]; SFB of the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [F4704, F4710]; European Union; ERC [242922]; Boehringer Ingelheim","We thank M.

91,215,310.0,"From determining the optical properties of simple molecular crystals to establishing the preferred handedness in highly complex vertebrates, molecular chirality profoundly influences the structural, mechanical and optical properties of both synthetic and biological matter on macroscopic length scales(1,2). In soft materials such as amphiphilic lipids and liquid crystals, the competition between local chiral interactions and global constraints imposed by the geometry of the self-assembled structures leads to frustration and the assembly of unique materials(3-6). An example of particular interest is smectic liquid crystals, where the two-dimensional layered geometry cannot support twist and chirality is consequently expelled to the edges in a manner analogous to the expulsion of a magnetic field from superconductors(7-10). Here we demonstrate a consequence of this geometric frustration that leads to a new design principle for the assembly of chiral molecules. Using a model system of colloidal membranes(11), we show that molecular chirality can control the interfacial tension, an important property of multi-component mixtures. This suggests an analogy between chiral twist, which is expelled to the edges of two-dimensional membranes, and amphiphilic surfactants, which are expelled to oil-water interfaces(12). As with surfactants, chiral control of interfacial tension drives the formation of many polymorphic assemblages such as twisted ribbons with linear and circular topologies, starfish membranes, and double and triple helices. Tuning molecular chirality in situ allows dynamical control of line tension, which powers polymorphic transitions between various chiral structures. These findings outline a general strategy for the assembly of reconfigurable chiral materials that can easily be moved, stretched, attached to one another and transformed between multiple conformational states, thus allowing precise assembly and nanosculpting of highly dynamical and designable materials with complex topologies.","Gibaud, Thomas; Barry, Edward; Zakhary, Mark J.; Henglin, Mir; Ward, Andrew; Yang, Yasheng; Berciu, Cristina; Oldenbourg, Rudolf; Hagan, Michael F.; Nicastro, Daniela; Meyer, Robert B.; Dogic, Zvonimir","Gibaud, T; Barry, E; Zakhary, MJ; Henglin, M; Ward, A; Yang, YS; Berciu, C; Oldenbourg, R; Hagan, MF; Nicastro, D; Meyer, RB; Dogic, Z",348.0,"[Gibaud, Thomas; Barry, Edward; Zakhary, Mark J.; Henglin, Mir; Ward, Andrew; Yang, Yasheng; Hagan, Michael F.; Meyer, Robert B.; Dogic, Zvonimir] Brandeis Univ, Martin Fisher Sch Phys, Waltham, MA 02454 USA; [Berciu, Cristina; Nicastro, Daniela] Brandeis Univ, Dept Biol, Waltham, MA 02454 USA; [Oldenbourg, Rudolf] Marine Biol Lab, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10769,Article,,zdogic@brandeis.edu,U127,"US National Science Foundation [NSF-MRSEC-0820492, NSF-DMR-0955776, NSF-MRI-0923057, NSF-CMMI-1068566]; Petroleum Research Fund [ACS-PRF 50558-DNI7]","This work was supported by the US National Science Foundation (NSF-MRSEC-0820492, NSF-DMR-0955776, NSF-MRI-0923057, NSF-CMMI-1068566) and the Petroleum Research Fund (ACS-PRF 50558-DNI7).

92,55,20.0,"Active galactic nuclei and quasars are thought to be scaled- up versions of Galactic black hole binaries, powered by accretion onto supermassive black holes with masses of 10(6)-10(9) M., as opposed to the similar to 10 M. in binaries (here M. is the solar mass). One example of the similarities between these two types of systems is the characteristic rapid X- ray variability seen from the accretion flow(1). The power spectrum of this variability in black hole binaries consists of a broad noise with multiple quasi- periodic oscillations superimposed on it. Although the broad noise component has been observed in many active galactic nuclei(2,3), there have hitherto been no significant detections of quasi- periodic oscillations(4-6). Here we report the discovery of an similar to 1- hour X- ray periodicity in a bright active galaxy, RE J1034+396. The signal is highly statistically significant ( at the 5.6 sigma level) and very coherent, with quality factorQ > 16.

93,32,353.0,"The class of exotic Jupiter-mass planets that orbit very close to their parent stars were not explicitly expected before their discovery(1). The recently discovered(2) transiting planet WASP-12b has a mass M = 1.4 +/- 0.1 Jupiter masses (M(J)), a mean orbital distance of only 3.1 stellar radii ( meaning it is subject to intense tidal forces), and a period of 1.1 days. Its radius 1.79 +/- 0.09 R(J) is unexpectedly large and its orbital eccentricity 0.049 +/- 0.015 is even more surprising because such close orbits are usually quickly circularized. Here we report an analysis of its properties, which reveals that the planet is losing mass to its host star at a rate of about 10(-7) M(J) per year. The planet's surface is distorted by the star's gravity and the light curve produced by its prolate shape will differ by about ten per cent from that of a spherical planet. We conclude that dissipation of the star's tidal perturbation in the planet's convective envelope provides the energy source for its large volume. We predict up to 10 mJy CO band-head (2.292 mu m) emission from a tenuous disk around the host star, made up of tidally stripped planetary gas. It may also contain a detectable resonant super-Earth, as a hypothetical perturber that continually stirs up WASP-12b's eccentricity.","Li, Shu-lin; Miller, N.; Lin, Douglas N.

94,160,451.0,"Artificial spin ice(1) is a class of lithographically created arrays of interacting ferromagnetic nanometre-scale islands. It was introduced to investigate many-body phenomena related to frustration and disorder in a material that could be tailored to precise specifications and imaged directly. Because of the large magnetic energy scales of these nanoscale islands, it has so far been impossible to thermally anneal artificial spin ice into desired thermodynamic ensembles; nearly all studies of artificial spin ice have either treated it as a granular material activated by alternating fields(2) or focused on the as-grown state of the arrays(3). This limitation has prevented experimental investigation of novel phases that can emerge from the nominal ground states of frustrated lattices. For example, artificial kagome spin ice, in which the islands are arranged on the edges of a hexagonal net, is predicted to support states with monopolar charge order at entropies below that of the previously observed pseudo-ice manifold(4). Here we demonstrate a method for thermalizing artificial spin ices with square and kagome lattices by heating above the Curie temperature of the constituent material. In this manner, artificial square spin ice achieves unprecedented thermal ordering of the moments. In artificial kagome spin ice, we observe incipient crystallization of the magnetic charges embedded in pseudo-ice, with crystallites of magnetic charges whose size can be controlled by tuning the lattice constant. We find excellent agreement between experimental data and Monte Carlo simulations of emergent charge-charge interactions.","Zhang, Sheng; Gilbert, Ian; Nisoli, Cristiano; Chern, Gia-Wei; Erickson, Michael J.; O'Brien, Liam; Leighton, Chris; Lammert, Paul E.; Crespi, Vincent H.; Schiffer, Peter","Zhang, S; Gilbert, I; Nisoli, C; Chern, GW; Erickson, MJ; O'Brien, L; Leighton, C; Lammert, PE; Crespi, VH; Schiffer, P",553.0,"[Zhang, Sheng; Lammert, Paul E.; Crespi, Vincent H.] Penn State Univ, Dept Phys, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Zhang, Sheng; Lammert, Paul E.; Crespi, Vincent H.] Penn State Univ, Mat Res Inst, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Gilbert, Ian; Schiffer, Peter] Univ Illinois, Dept Phys, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Gilbert, Ian; Schiffer, Peter] Univ Illinois, Frederick Seitz Mat Res Lab, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Nisoli, Cristiano; Chern, Gia-Wei] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Div Theoret, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA; [Erickson, Michael J.; O'Brien, Liam; Leighton, Chris] Univ Minnesota, Dept Chem Engn & Mat Sci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [O'Brien, Liam] Univ Cambridge, Cavendish Lab, Dept Phys, Thin Film Magnetism Grp, Cambridge CB3 0HE, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12399,Article,,pschiffe@illinois.edu,557,"US Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division [DE-SC0005313]; US Department of Energy at LANL [DE-AC52-06NA253962]; NSF MRSEC [DMR-0819885, DMR-0820404]; EU Marie Curie IOF [299376]","This project was funded by the US Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under grant no.

95,13,264.0,"Bacteria and Archaea have developed several defence strategies against foreign nucleic acids such as viral genomes and plasmids. Among them, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) loci together with cas (CRISPR-associated) genes form the CRISPR/Cas immune system, which involves partially palindromic repeats separated by short stretches of DNA called spacers, acquired from extrachromosomal elements. It was recently demonstrated that these variable loci can incorporate spacers from infecting bacteriophages and then provide immunity against subsequent bacteriophage infections in a sequence-specific manner. Here we show that the Streptococcus thermophilus CRISPR1/Cas system can also naturally acquire spacers from a self-replicating plasmid containing an antibiotic-resistance gene, leading to plasmid loss. Acquired spacers that match antibiotic-resistance genes provide a novel means to naturally select bacteria that cannot uptake and disseminate such genes. We also provide in vivo evidence that the CRISPR1/Cas system specifically cleaves plasmid and bacteriophage double-stranded DNA within the proto-spacer, at specific sites. Our data show that the CRISPR/Cas immune system is remarkably adapted to cleave invading DNA rapidly and has the potential for exploitation to generate safer microbial strains.","Garneau, Josiane E.; Dupuis, Marie-Eve; Villion, Manuela; Romero, Dennis A.; Barrangou, Rodolphe; Boyaval, Patrick; Fremaux, Christophe; Horvath, Philippe; Magadan, Alfonso H.; Moineau, Sylvain","Garneau, JE; Dupuis, ME; Villion, M; Romero, DA; Barrangou, R; Boyaval, P; Fremaux, C; Horvath, P; Magadan, AH; Moineau, S",67.0,"[Garneau, Josiane E.; Dupuis, Marie-Eve; Villion, Manuela; Magadan, Alfonso H.; Moineau, Sylvain] Univ Laval, Felix dHerelle Reference Ctr Bacterial Viruses, Dept Biochim Microbiol & Bioinformat, Fac Med Dent,Grp Rech Ecol Buccale,Fac Sci & Geni, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Romero, Dennis A.; Barrangou, Rodolphe] Danisco USA Inc, Madison, WI 53716 USA; [Boyaval, Patrick; Fremaux, Christophe; Horvath, Philippe] Danisco France SAS, F-86220 Dange St Romain, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09523,Article,,Sylvain.Moineau@bcm.ulaval.ca,+,Novalait/FQRNT; Clarin/FICYT; NSERC; CIHR,"We thank T.R.

96,181,493.0,"Insulin receptor signalling has a central role in mammalian biology, regulating cellular metabolism, growth, division, differentiation and survival(1,2). Insulin resistance contributes to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus and the onset of Alzheimer's disease(3); aberrant signalling occurs in diverse cancers, exacerbated by crosstalk with the homologous type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R)(4). Despite more than three decades of investigation, the three-dimensional structure of the insulin-insulin receptor complex has proved elusive, confounded by the complexity of producing the receptor protein. Here we present the first view, to our knowledge, of the interaction of insulin with its primary binding site on the insulin receptor, on the basis of four crystal structures of insulin bound to truncated insulin receptor constructs. The direct interaction of insulin with the first leucine-rich-repeat domain (L1) of insulin receptor is seen to be sparse, the hormone instead engaging the insulin receptor carboxy-terminal alpha-chain (alpha CT) segment, which is itself remodelled on the face of L1 upon insulin binding. Contact between insulin and L1 is restricted to insulin B-chain residues. The aCT segment displaces the B-chain C-terminal beta-strand away from the hormone core, revealing the mechanism of a long-proposed conformational switch in insulin upon receptor engagement. This mode of hormone-receptor recognition is novel within the broader family of receptor tyrosine kinases(5). We support these findings by photo-crosslinking data that place the suggested interactions into the context of the holoreceptor and by isothermal titration calorimetry data that dissect the hormone-insulin receptor interface. Together, our findings provide an explanation for a wealth of biochemical data from the insulin receptor and IGF1R systems relevant to the design of therapeutic insulin analogues.","Menting, John G.; Whittaker, Jonathan; Margetts, Mai B.; Whittaker, Linda J.; Kong, Geoffrey K. -W.; Smith, Brian J.; Watson, Christopher J.; Zakova, Lenka; Kletvikova, Emilia; Jiracek, Jiri; Chan, Shu Jin; Steiner, Donald F.; Dodson, Guy G.; Brzozowski, Andrzej M.; Weiss, Michael A.; Ward, Colin W.; Lawrence, Michael C.","Menting, JG; Whittaker, J; Margetts, MB; Whittaker, LJ; Kong, GKW; Smith, BJ; Watson, CJ; Zakova, L; Kletvikova, E; Jiracek, J; Chan, SJ; Steiner, DF; Dodson, GG; Brzozowski, AM; Weiss, MA; Ward, CW; Lawrence, MC",241.0,"[Menting, John G.; Margetts, Mai B.; Kong, Geoffrey K. -W.; Smith, Brian J.; Ward, Colin W.; Lawrence, Michael C.] Walter & Eliza Hall Inst Med Res, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia; [Whittaker, Jonathan; Whittaker, Linda J.; Weiss, Michael A.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Smith, Brian J.] La Trobe Univ, La Trobe Inst Mol Sci, Dept Chem, Melbourne, Vic 3086, Australia; [Watson, Christopher J.; Dodson, Guy G.; Brzozowski, Andrzej M.] Univ York, Dept Chem, York Struct Biol Lab, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Zakova, Lenka; Kletvikova, Emilia; Jiracek, Jiri] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Inst Organ Chem & Biochem, Vvi, CR-16610 Prague, Czech Republic; [Chan, Shu Jin; Steiner, Donald F.] Univ Chicago, Dept Med, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Lawrence, Michael C.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Med Biol, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11781,Article,,michael.weiss@case.edu; lawrence@wehi.edu.au,U276,"Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) [516729, 575539, 1005896]; Hazel and Pip Appel Fund; NHMRC [361646]; Victorian State Government; NIH [DK40949, DK13914, DK20595]; American Diabetes Association [1-11INI-31]; Grant Agency of the Czech Republic [P207/11/P430]; Research Project of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic [RVO: 61388963]; BBSRC; UoY Research Priming Fund","This Letter is dedicated to our co-author, the late Guy Dodson, in recognition of his lifetime contribution to the study of the structure of insulin.

Although Rho was the first termination factor to be discovered(4), the actual mechanism by which it reaches and disrupts the elongation complex (EC) is unknown. Here we show that the termination-committed Rho molecule associates with RNA polymerase (RNAP) throughout the transcription cycle; that is, it does not require the nascent transcript for initial binding. Moreover, the formation of the RNAP-Rho complex is crucial for termination. We show further that Rho-dependent termination is a two-step process that involves rapid EC inactivation (trap) and a relatively slow dissociation. Inactivation is the critical rate-limiting step that establishes the position of the termination site. The trap mechanism depends on the allosterically induced rearrangement of the RNAP catalytic centre by means of the evolutionarily conserved mobile trigger-loop domain, which is also required for EC dissociation. The key structural and functional similarities, which we found between Rho-dependent and intrinsic (Rho-independent) termination pathways, argue that the allosteric mechanism of termination is general and likely to be preserved for all cellular RNAPs throughout evolution.","Epshtein, Vitaly; Dutta, Dipak; Wade, Joseph; Nudler, Evgeny","Epshtein, V; Dutta, D; Wade, J; Nudler, E",245.0,"[Epshtein, Vitaly; Dutta, Dipak; Nudler, Evgeny] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Wade, Joseph] SUNY Albany, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biomed Sci, Albany, NY 12201 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08669,Article,,evgeny.nudler@nyumc.org,U136,National Institutes of Health [R01GM58750],"We thank I.

98,127,190.0,"Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoinflammatory disease that affects 1-2% of the world's population and is characterized by widespread joint inflammation. Interleukin-1 is an important mediator of cartilage destruction in rheumatic diseases(1), but our understanding of the upstream mechanisms leading to production of interleukin-1 beta in rheumatoid arthritis is limited by the absence of suitable mouse models of the disease in which inflammasomes contribute to pathology. Myeloid-cell-specific deletion of the rheumatoid arthritis susceptibility gene A20/Tnfaip3 in mice (A20(myel-KO) mice) triggers a spontaneous erosive polyarthritis that resembles rheumatoid arthritis in patients(2). Rheumatoid arthritis in A20(myel-KO) mice is not rescued by deletion of tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 (ref. 2). Here we show, however, that it crucially relies on the Nlrp3 inflammasome and interleukin-1 receptor signalling. Macrophages lacking A 20 have increased basal and lipopolysaccharide-induced expression levels of the inflammasome adaptor Nlrp3 and proIL-beta b. As a result, A 20-deficiency in macrophages significantly enhances Nlrp3 inflammasome- mediated caspase-1 activation, pyroptosis and interleukin-1 beta secretion by soluble and crystalline Nlrp3 stimuli. In contrast, activation of the Nlrc4 and AIM2 inflammasomes is not altered. Importantly, increased Nlrp3 inflammasome activation contributes to the pathology of rheumatoid arthritis in vivo, because deletion of Nlrp3, caspase-1 and the interleukin-1 receptor markedly protects against rheumatoid-arthritis-associated inflammation and cartilage destruction in A20(myel-KO) mice. These results reveal A20 as a novel negative regulator of Nlrp3 inflammasome activation, and describe A(20myel-KO) mice as the first experimental model to study the role of inflammasomes in the pathology of rheumatoid arthritis.","Vande Walle, Lieselotte; Van Opdenbosch, Nina; Jacques, Peggy; Fossoul, Amelie; Verheugen, Eveline; Vogel, Peter; Beyaert, Rudi; Elewaut, Dirk; Kanneganti, Thirumala-Devi; van Loo, Geert; Lamkanfi, Mohamed","Vande Walle, L; Van Opdenbosch, N; Jacques, P; Fossoul, A; Verheugen, E; Vogel, P; Beyaert, R; Elewaut, D; Kanneganti, TD; van Loo, G; Lamkanfi, M",69.0,"[Vande Walle, Lieselotte; Van Opdenbosch, Nina; Fossoul, Amelie; Lamkanfi, Mohamed] Univ Ghent VIB, Dept Med Prot Res, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Vande Walle, Lieselotte; Van Opdenbosch, Nina; Fossoul, Amelie; Lamkanfi, Mohamed] Univ Ghent, Dept Biochem, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Jacques, Peggy; Verheugen, Eveline; Elewaut, Dirk] Univ Ghent, Dept Rheumatol, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Vogel, Peter; Kanneganti, Thirumala-Devi] St Jude Childrens Res Hosp, Dept Immunol, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Beyaert, Rudi; van Loo, Geert] Univ Ghent VIB, Inflammat Res Ctr, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium; [Beyaert, Rudi; van Loo, Geert] Univ Ghent, Dept Biomed Mol Biol, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13322,Article,1476-4687,mohamed.lamkanfi@vib-ugent.be,+,"Ghent University [BOF14/GOA/013]; European Research Council [281600]; FWO [G030212N, 1.2.201.10.N.00, 1.5.122.11.N.00, Odysseus-G091908, G061910N, G016812N]; Queen Elisabeth Medical Foundation; Ghent University Group-ID MRP; National Institutes of Health [AR056296, CA163507, AI101935]; American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities","We thank R.

99,47,295.0,"The Myc oncogene regulates the expression of several components of the protein synthetic machinery, including ribosomal proteins, initiation factors of translation, RNA polymerase III and ribosomal DNA(1,2). Whether and how increasing the cellular protein synthesis capacity affects the multistep process leading to cancer remains to be addressed. Here we use ribosomal protein heterozygote mice as a genetic tool to restore increased protein synthesis in E mu-Myc/+ transgenic mice to normal levels, and show that the oncogenic potential of Myc in this context is suppressed. Our findings demonstrate that the ability of Myc to increase protein synthesis directly augments cell size and is sufficient to accelerate cell cycle progression independently of known cell cycle targets transcriptionally regulated by Myc. In addition, when protein synthesis is restored to normal levels, Myc- overexpressing precancerous cells are more efficiently eliminated by programmed cell death. Our findings reveal a new mechanism that links increases in general protein synthesis rates downstream of an oncogenic signal to a specific molecular impairment in the modality of translation initiation used to regulate the expression of selective messenger RNAs. We show that an aberrant increase in cap- dependent translation downstream of Myc hyperactivation specifically impairs the translational switch to internal ribosomal entry site ( IRES)- dependent translation that is required for accurate mitotic progression. Failure of this translational switch results in reduced mitotic- specific expression of the endogenous IRES- dependent form of Cdk11 ( also known as Cdc21 and PITSLRE)(3-5), which leads to cytokinesis defects and is associated with increased centrosome numbers and genome instability in E mu-Myc/+ mice. When accurate translational control is re- established in E mu-Myc/+ mice, genome instability is suppressed. Our findings demonstrate how perturbations in translational control provide a highly specific outcome for gene expression, genome stability and cancer initiation that have important implications for understanding the molecular mechanism of cancer formation at the post- genomic level.","Barna, Maria; Pusic, Aya; Zollo, Ornella; Costa, Maria; Kondrashov, Nadya; Rego, Eduardo; Rao, Pulivarthi H.; Ruggero, Davide","Barna, M; Pusic, A; Zollo, O; Costa, M; Kondrashov, N; Rego, E; Rao, PH; Ruggero, D",971.0,"[Barna, Maria; Kondrashov, Nadya] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem & Biophys, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Pusic, Aya; Zollo, Ornella; Costa, Maria; Ruggero, Davide] Univ Calif San Francisco, Helen Diller Family Comprehens Canc Ctr, Sch Med, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Pusic, Aya; Zollo, Ornella; Costa, Maria; Ruggero, Davide] Univ Calif San Francisco, Helen Diller Family Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dept Urol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Rego, Eduardo] Univ Sao Paulo, Ctr Cell Based Therapy, Fdn Hemoctr Ribeirao Preto, BR-14048900 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Rao, Pulivarthi H.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Pediat, Houston, TX 77030 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07449,Article,1476-4687,maria.barna@ucsf.edu; Davide.Ruggero@ucsf.edu,U79,NIH; Sandler Foundation,"We thank F.

100,2,64.0,"The disintegration of ice shelves, reduced sea-ice and glacier extent, and shifting ecological zones observed around Antarctica(1,2) highlight the impact of recent atmospheric(3) and oceanic warming(4) on the cryosphere. Observations(1,2) and models(5,6) suggest that oceanic and atmospheric temperature variations at Antarctica's margins affect global cryosphere stability, ocean circulation, sea levels and carbon cycling. In particular, recent climate changes on the Antarctic Peninsula have been dramatic, yet the Holocene climate variability of this region is largely unknown, limiting our ability to evaluate ongoing changes within the context of historical variability and underlying forcing mechanisms. Here we show that surface ocean temperatures at the continental margin of the western Antarctic Peninsula cooled by 3-4 degrees C over the past 12,000 years, tracking the Holocene decline of local (65 degrees S) spring insolation. Our results, based on TEX(86) sea surface temperature (SST) proxy evidence from a marine sediment core, indicate the importance of regional summer duration as a driver of Antarctic seasonal sea-ice fluctuations(7). On millennial timescales, abrupt SST fluctuations of 2-4 degrees C coincide with globally recognized climate variability(8). Similarities between our SSTs, Southern Hemisphere westerly wind reconstructions(9) and El Nino/Southern Oscillation variability(10) indicate that present climate teleconnections between the tropical Pacific Ocean and the western Antarctic Peninsula(11) strengthened late in the Holocene epoch. We conclude that during the Holocene, Southern Ocean temperatures at the western Antarctic Peninsula margin were tied to changes in the position of the westerlies, which have a critical role in global carbon cycling(9,12).","Shevenell, A.

101,87,419.0,"Genetic imprinting, found in flowering plants and placental mammals, uses DNA methylation to yield gene expression that is dependent on the parent of origin(1). DNA methyltransferase 3a (Dnmt3a) and its regulatory factor, DNA methyltransferase 3-like protein (Dnmt3L), are both required for the de novo DNA methylation of imprinted genes in mammalian germ cells. Dnmt3L interacts specifically with unmethylated lysine 4 of histone H3 through its amino-terminal PHD (plant homeodomain)-like domain(2). Here we show, with the use of crystallography, that the carboxy-terminal domain of human Dnmt3L interacts with the catalytic domain of Dnmt3a, demonstrating that Dnmt3L has dual functions of binding the unmethylated histone tail and activating DNA methyltransferase. The complexed C-terminal domains of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3L showed further dimerization through Dnmt3a-Dnmt3a interaction, forming a tetrameric complex with two active sites. Substitution of key non-catalytic residues at the Dnmt3a-Dnmt3L interface or the Dnmt3a-Dnmt3a interface eliminated enzymatic activity. Molecular modelling of a DNA Dnmt3a dimer indicated that the two active sites are separated by about one DNA helical turn. The C-terminal domain of Dnmt3a oligomerizes on DNA to form a nucleoprotein filament. A periodicity in the activity of Dnmt3a on long DNA revealed a correlation of methylated CpG sites at distances of eight to ten base pairs, indicating that oligomerization leads Dnmt3a to methylate DNA in a periodic pattern. A similar periodicity is observed for the frequency of CpG sites in the differentially methylated regions of 12 maternally imprinted mouse genes. These results suggest a basis for the recognition and methylation of differentially methylated regions in imprinted genes, involving the detection of both nucleosome modification and CpG spacing.","Jia, Da; Jurkowska, Renata Z.; Zhang, Xing; Jeltsch, Albert; Cheng, Xiaodong","Jia, D; Jurkowska, RZ; Zhang, X; Jeltsch, A; Cheng, XD",248.0,"Jacobs Univ Bremen, Sch Sci & Engn, Biochem Lab, D-28759 Bremen, Germany; Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06146,Article,1476-4687,a.jeltsch@jacobs-university.de; xcheng@emory.edu,U13,"NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM049245, R01 GM049245-14]",,209NF,,,HISTONE MODIFICATIONS; MOUSE; REGIONS; METHYLTRANSFERASES; SPERMATOGENESIS; STIMULATION; MECHANISM; IGF2R; MARKS,7159.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,"Jeltsch, Albert/0000-0001-6113-9290","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",13-Sep,6.0,LONDON,17713477.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007.0,"Jeltsch, Albert/O-7404-2014","Jeltsch, A (reprint author), Jacobs Univ Bremen, Sch Sci & Engn, Biochem Lab, D-28759 Bremen, Germany.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,422.0,Structure of Dnmt3a bound to Dnmt3L suggests a model for de novo DNA methylation,3.0,57.0,WOS:000249394500056,419.0,449,Multidisciplinary Sciences,441,xiaodong,cheng,14048.0,1,male,1.0,fg3sXKwAAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",52921414,1,14170890,1,The Great Detective (film),The Great Detective (film),0,0
102,175,267.0,"Loss of control over harmful drug seeking is one of the most intractable aspects of addiction, as human substance abusers continue to pursue drugs despite incurring significant negative consequences(1). Human studies have suggested that deficits in prefrontal cortical function and consequential loss of inhibitory control(2-4) could be crucial in promoting compulsive drug use. However, it remains unknown whether chronic drug use compromises cortical activity and, equally important, whether this deficit promotes compulsive cocaine seeking. Here we use a rat model of compulsive drug seeking(5-8) in which cocaine seeking persists in a subgroup of rats despite delivery of noxious foot shocks. We show that prolonged cocaine self-administration decreases ex vivo intrinsic excitability of deep-layer pyramidal neurons in the prelimbic cortex, which was significantly more pronounced in compulsive drug-seeking animals. Furthermore, compensating for hypoactive prelimbic cortex neurons with in vivo optogenetic prelimbic cortex stimulation significantly prevented compulsive cocaine seeking, whereas optogenetic prelimbic cortex inhibition significantly increased compulsive cocaine seeking. Our results show a marked reduction in prelimbic cortex excitability in compulsive cocaine-seeking rats, and that in vivo optogenetic prelimbic cortex stimulation decreased compulsive drug-seeking behaviours. Thus, targeted stimulation of the prefrontal cortex could serve as a promising therapy for treating compulsive drug use.","Chen, Billy T.; Yau, Hau-Jie; Hatch, Christina; Kusumoto-Yoshida, Ikue; Cho, Saemi L.; Hopf, F.

103,31,346.0,"A major goal of regenerative medicine is to instruct formation of multipotent, tissue-specific stem cells from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) for cell replacement therapies. Generation of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from iPSCs or embryonic stem cells (ESCs) is not currently possible, however, necessitating a better understanding of how HSCs normally arise during embryonic development. We previously showed that haematopoiesis occurs through four distinct waves during zebrafish development, with HSCs arising in the final wave in close association with the dorsal aorta. Recent reports have suggested that murine HSCs derive from haemogenic endothelial cells (ECs) lining the aortic floor(1,2). Additional in vitro studies have similarly indicated that the haematopoietic progeny of ESCs arise through intermediates with endothelial potential(3,4). Here we have used the unique strengths of the zebrafish embryo to image directly the generation of HSCs from the ventral wall of the dorsal aorta. Using combinations of fluorescent reporter transgenes, confocal time-lapse microscopy and flow cytometry, we have identified and isolated the stepwise intermediates as aortic haemogenic endothelium transitions to nascent HSCs. Finally, using a permanent lineage tracing strategy, we demonstrate that the HSCs generated from haemogenic endothelium are the lineal founders of the adult haematopoietic system.","Bertrand, Julien Y.; Chi, Neil C.; Santoso, Buyung; Teng, Shutian; Stainier, Didier Y.

104,106,264.0,"Ammonia oxidation is the first step in nitrification, a key process in the global nitrogen cycle that results in the formation of nitrate through microbial activity(1,2). The increase in nitrate availability in soils is important for plant nutrition, but it also has considerable impact on groundwater pollution owing to leaching. Here we show that archaeal ammonia oxidizers are more abundant in soils than their well-known bacterial counterparts. We investigated the abundance of the gene encoding a subunit of the key enzyme ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) in 12 pristine and agricultural soils of three climatic zones. amoA gene copies of Crenarchaeota ( Archaea) were up to 3,000-fold more abundant than bacterial amoA genes. High amounts of crenarchaeota-specific lipids, including crenarchaeol, correlated with the abundance of archaeal amoA gene copies. Furthermore, reverse transcription quantitative PCR studies and complementary DNA analysis using novel cloning-independent pyrosequencing technology demonstrated the activity of the archaea in situ and supported the numerical dominance of archaeal over bacterial ammonia oxidizers. Our results indicate that crenarchaeota may be the most abundant ammonia-oxidizing organisms in soil ecosystems on Earth.","Leininger, S.; Urich, T.; Schloter, M.; Schwark, L.; Qi, J.; Nicol, G.

105,193,365.0,"Despite the broad conceptual and applied relevance of how the number of species or endemics changes with area (the species-area and endemics-area relationships (SAR and EAR)), our understanding of universality and pervasiveness of these patterns across taxa and regions has remained limited. The SAR has traditionally been approximated by a power law(1), but recent theories predict a triphasic SAR in logarithmic space, characterized by steeper increases in species richness at both small and large spatial scales(2-6). Here we uncover such universally upward accelerating SARs for amphibians, birds and mammals across the world's major landmasses. Although apparently taxon-specific and continent-specific, all curves collapse into one universal function after the area is rescaled by using the mean range sizes of taxa within continents. In addition, all EARs approximately follow a power law with a slope close to 1, indicating that for most spatial scales there is roughly proportional species extinction with area loss. These patterns can be predicted by a simulation model based on the random placement of contiguous ranges within a domain. The universality of SARs and EARs after rescaling implies that both total and endemic species richness within an area, and also their rate of change with area, can be estimated by using only the knowledge of mean geographic range size in the region and mean species richness at one spatial scale.","Storch, David; Keil, Petr; Jetz, Walter","Storch, D; Keil, P; Jetz, W",78.0,"[Storch, David] Charles Univ Prague, Ctr Theoret Study, Prague 11000 1, Czech Republic; [Storch, David] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Prague 11000 1, Czech Republic; [Storch, David] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Ecol, CR-12844 Prague 2, Czech Republic; [Keil, Petr; Jetz, Walter] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11226,Article,1476-4687,storch@cts.cuni.cz,+,"Grant Agency of the Czech Republic [P505/11/2387]; Czech Ministry of Education [MSM0021620845]; EU FP7 SCALES project [26852]; National Science Foundation [DBI 0960550, DEB 1026764]; NASA Biodiversity Program [NNX11AP72G]","We thank J.

Previously, it has been proposed to use electronic feedback to cool a high frequency ( 10 MHz) resonator to near its ground state(4). In other work, a low frequency resonator was cooled from room temperature to 18 K by passive optical feedback(5). Additionally, active optical feedback of atomic force microscope cantilevers has been used to modify their response characteristics(6), and cooling to approximately 2 K has been measured(7). Here we demonstrate active optical feedback cooling to 135 +/- 15 mK of a micromechanical resonator integrated with a high-quality optical resonator.

Here we monitored the spatiotemporal dynamics of CaMKII activation in individual dendritic spines during LTP using two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, in combination with two-photon glutamate uncaging. Induction of LTP and associated spine enlargement in single spines triggered transient (similar to 1 min) CaMKII activation restricted to the stimulated spines. CaMKII in spines was specifically activated by NMDA receptors and L-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels, presumably by nanodomain Ca(2+) near the channels, in response to glutamate uncaging and depolarization, respectively. The high degree of compartmentalization and channel specificity of CaMKII signalling allow stimuli-specific spatiotemporal patterns of CaMKII signalling and may be important for synapse-specificity of synaptic plasticity.","Lee, Seok-Jin R.; Escobedo-Lozoya, Yasmin; Szatmari, Erzsebet M.; Yasuda, Ryohei","Lee, SJR; Escobedo-Lozoya, Y; Szatmari, EM; Yasuda, R",299.0,"[Lee, Seok-Jin R.; Escobedo-Lozoya, Yasmin; Szatmari, Erzsebet M.; Yasuda, Ryohei] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Neurobiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07842,Article,,yasuda@neuro.duke.edu,U58,Burroughs Wellcome Fund; Dana Foundation; Alfred P.

108,163,5.0,"Some evolutionary innovations may originate non-adaptively as exaptations, or pre-adaptations, which are by-products of other adaptive traits(1-5). Examples include feathers, which originated before they were used in flight(2), and lens crystallins, which are light-refracting proteins that originated as enzymes(6). The question of how often adaptive traits have non-adaptive origins has profound implications for evolutionary biology, but is difficult to address systematically. Here we consider this issue in metabolism, one of the most ancient biological systems that is central to all life. We analyse a metabolic trait of great adaptive importance: the ability of a metabolic reaction network to synthesize all biomass from a single source of carbon and energy. We use novel computational methods to sample randomly many metabolic networks that can sustain life on any given carbon source but contain an otherwise random set of known biochemical reactions. We show that when we require such networks to be viable on one particular carbon source, they are typically also viable on multiple other carbon sources that were not targets of selection. For example, viability on glucose may entail viability on up to 44 other sole carbon sources. Any one adaptation in these metabolic systems typically entails multiple potential exaptations. Metabolic systems thus contain a latent potential for evolutionary innovations with non-adaptive origins. Our observations suggest that many more metabolic traits may have non-adaptive origins than is appreciated at present. They also challenge our ability to distinguish adaptive from non-adaptive traits.","Barve, Aditya; Wagner, Andreas","Barve, A; Wagner, A",203.0,"[Barve, Aditya; Wagner, Andreas] Univ Zurich, Inst Evolutionary Biol & Environm Sci, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Barve, Aditya; Wagner, Andreas] Swiss Inst Bioinformat, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Wagner, Andreas] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12301,Article,1476-4687,andreas.wagner@ieu.uzh.ch,+,Swiss National Science Foundation [315230-129708],"We thank K.

109,158,381.0,"Bacteria use modular polyketide synthases (PKSs) to assemble complex polyketides, many of which are leads for the development of clinical drugs, in particular anti-infectives and anti-tumoral agents(1). Because these multifarious compounds are notoriously difficult to synthesize, they are usually produced by microbial fermentation. During the past two decades, an impressive body of knowledge on modular PKSs(2,3) has been gathered that not only provides detailed insight into the biosynthetic pathways but also allows the rational engineering of enzymatic processing lines to yield structural analogues(4,5). Notably, a hallmark of all PKS modules studied so far is the head-to-tail fusion of acyl and malonyl building blocks, which leads to linear backbones. Yet, structural diversity is limited by this uniform assembly mode. Here we demonstrate a new type of PKS module from the endofungal bacterium Burkholderia rhizoxinica that catalyses a Michael-type acetyl addition to generate a branch in the carbon chain. In vitro reconstitution of the entire PKS module, X-ray structures of a ketosynthase-branching didomain and mutagenesis experiments revealed a crucial role of the ketosynthase domain in branching the carbon chain. We present a trapped intermediary state in which acyl carrier protein and ketosynthase are covalently linked by the branched polyketide and suggest a new mechanism for chain alkylation, which is functionally distinct from terpenoid-like beta-branching. For the rice seedling blight toxin rhizoxin, one of the strongest known anti-mitotic agents, the non-canonical polyketide modification is indispensable for phytotoxic and anti-tumoral activities. We propose that the formation of related pharmacophoric groups follows the same general scheme and infer a unifying vinylogous branching reaction for PKS modules with a ketosynthase-branching-acyl-carrier-protein architecture. This study unveils the structure and function of a new PKS module that broadens the biosynthetic scope of polyketide biosynthesis and sets the stage for rationally creating structural diversity.","Bretschneider, Tom; Heim, Joel B.; Heine, Daniel; Winkler, Robert; Busch, Benjamin; Kusebauch, Bjoern; Stehle, Thilo; Zocher, Georg; Hertweck, Christian","Bretschneider, T; Heim, JB; Heine, D; Winkler, R; Busch, B; Kusebauch, B; Stehle, T; Zocher, G; Hertweck, C",124.0,"[Bretschneider, Tom; Heine, Daniel; Winkler, Robert; Busch, Benjamin; Kusebauch, Bjoern; Hertweck, Christian] Leibniz Inst Nat Prod Res & Infect Biol HKI, Dept Biomol Chem, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Heim, Joel B.; Stehle, Thilo; Zocher, Georg] Univ Tubingen, Interfac Inst Biochem, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Stehle, Thilo] Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [Hertweck, Christian] Univ Jena, Chair Nat Prod Chem, D-07737 Jena, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12588,Article,,georg.zocher@uni-tuebingen.de; christian.hertweck@hki-jena.de,+,DFG [SFB 766]; Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes,"We thank A.

110,5,93.0,"Fluctuations in surface melting are known to affect the speed of glaciers and ice sheets(1-7), but their impact on the Greenland ice sheet in a warming climate remains uncertain(8). Although some studies suggest that greater melting produces greater ice-sheet acceleration(7,9), others have identified a long-term decrease in Greenland's flow despite increased melting(3). Here we use satellite observations of ice motion recorded in a land-terminating sector of southwest Greenland to investigate the manner in which ice flow develops during years of markedly different melting. Although peak rates of ice speed-up are positively correlated with the degree of melting, mean summer flow rates are not, because glacier slowdown occurs, on average, when a critical run-off threshold of about 1.4 centimetres a day is exceeded. In contrast to the first half of summer, when flow is similar in all years, speed-up during the latter half is 62 +/- 16 per cent less in warmer years. Consequently, in warmer years, the period of fast ice flow is three times shorter and, overall, summer ice flow is slower. This behaviour is at odds with that expected from basal lubrication alone(7,9). Instead, it mirrors that of mountain glaciers(10-12), where melt-induced acceleration of flow ceases during years of high melting once subglacial drainage becomes efficient. A model of ice-sheet flow that captures switching between cavity and channel drainage modes(13) is consistent with the run-off threshold, fast-flow periods, and later-summer speeds we have observed. Simulations of the Greenland ice-sheet flow under climate warming scenarios should account for the dynamic evolution of subglacial drainage; a simple model of basal lubrication alone misses key aspects of the ice sheet's response to climate warming.","Sundal, Aud Venke; Shepherd, Andrew; Nienow, Peter; Hanna, Edward; Palmer, Steven; Huybrechts, Philippe","Sundal, AV; Shepherd, A; Nienow, P; Hanna, E; Palmer, S; Huybrechts, P",522.0,"[Sundal, Aud Venke; Shepherd, Andrew; Palmer, Steven] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Nienow, Peter] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH8 9XP, Midlothian, Scotland; [Hanna, Edward] Univ Sheffield, Dept Geog, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Huybrechts, Philippe] Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Geog, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09740,Article,,a.shepherd@leeds.ac.uk,U83,UK NERC National Centre for Earth Observation; EU [026],"This work was supported by the UK NERC National Centre for Earth Observation, a Philip Leverhulme Prize to A.S. and by the EU FP7 Ice2Sea project (publ. no. 026).

111,63,255.0,"Following the discovery of long- range antiferromagnetic order in the parent compounds of high- transition- temperature ( high- T(c)) copper oxides(1,2), there have been efforts to understand the role of magnetism in the superconductivity that occurs when mobile 'electrons' or 'holes' are doped into the antiferromagnetic parent compounds. Superconductivity in the newly discovered rare- earth iron- based oxide systems ROFeAs ( R, rare- earth metal) also arises from either electron(3-7) or hole(8) doping of their non- superconducting parent compounds. The parent material LaOFeAs is metallic but shows anomalies near 150 K in both resistivity and d. c. magnetic susceptibility(3). Although optical conductivity and theoretical calculations suggest that LaOFeAs exhibits a spin- density- wave ( SDW) instability that is suppressed by doping with electrons to induce superconductivity(9), there has been no direct evidence of SDW order. Here we report neutron- scattering experiments that demonstrate that LaOFeAs undergoes an abrupt structural distortion below 155 K, changing the symmetry from tetragonal ( space group P4/ nmm) to monoclinic ( space group P112/ n) at low temperatures, and then, at similar to 137 K, develops long- range SDW- type antiferromagnetic order with a small moment but simple magnetic structure(9). Doping the system with fluorine suppresses both the magnetic order and the structural distortion in favour of superconductivity. Therefore, like high- T(c) copper oxides, the superconducting regime in these iron- based materials occurs in close proximity to a long- range- ordered antiferromagnetic ground state.","de la Cruz, Clarina; Huang, Q.; Lynn, J.

112,136,377.0,"T cells discriminate between foreign and host molecules by recognizing distinct microbial molecules, predominantly peptides and lipids(1-4). Riboflavin precursors found in many bacteria and yeast also selectively activate mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells(5,6), an abundant population of innate-like T cells in humans(7-9). However, the genesis of these small organic molecules and their mode of presentation to MAIT cells by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-related protein MR1 (ref. 8) are not well understood. Here we show that MAIT-cell activation requires key genes encoding enzymes that form 5-amino-6-D-ribitylaminouracil (5-A-RU), an early intermediate in bacterial riboflavin synthesis. Although 5-A-RU does not bind MR1 or activate MAIT cells directly, it does form potent MAIT-activating antigens via non-enzymatic reactions with small molecules, such as glyoxal and methylglyoxal, which are derived from other metabolic pathways. The MAIT antigens formed by the reactions between 5-A-RU and glyoxal/methylglyoxal were simple adducts, 5-(2-oxoethylideneamino)-6-D-ribitylaminouracil (5-OE-RU) and 5-(2-oxopropylideneamino)-6-D-ribitylaminouracil (5-OP-RU), respectively, which bound to MR1 as shown by crystal structures of MAIT TCR ternary complexes. Although 5-OP-RU and 5-OE-RU are unstable intermediates, they became trapped by MR1 as reversible covalent Schiff base complexes. Mass spectra supported the capture by MR1 of 5-OP-RU and 5-OE-RU from bacterial cultures that activate MAIT cells, but not from non-activating bacteria, indicating that these MAIT antigens are present in a range of microbes. Thus, MR1 is able to capture, stabilize and present chemically unstable pyrimidine intermediates, which otherwise convert to lumazines, as potent antigens to MAIT cells. These pyrimidine adducts are microbial signatures for MAIT-cell immunosurveillance.","Corbett, Alexandra J.; Eckle, Sidonia B.

113,148,256.0,"Planets with sizes between that of Earth (with radius R-circle plus) and Neptune (about 4R(circle plus)) are now known to be common around Sun-like stars(1-3). Most such planets have been discovered through the transit technique, by which the planet's size can be determined from the fraction of starlight blocked by the planet as it passes in front of its star. Measuring the planet's mass-and hence its density, which is a clue to its composition-is more difficult. Planets of size 2-4R(circle plus) have proved to have a wide range of densities, implying a diversity of compositions(4,5), but these measurements did not extend to planets as small as Earth. Here we report Doppler spectroscopic measurements of the mass of the Earth-sized planet Kepler-78b, which orbits its host star every 8.5 hours (ref. 6). Given a radius of 1.20 +/- 0.09R(circle plus) and a mass of 1.69 +/- 0.41M(circle plus), the planet's mean density of 5.3 +/- 1.8 g cm(-3) is similar to Earth's, suggesting a composition of rock and iron.","Howard, Andrew W.; Sanchis-Ojeda, Roberto; Marcy, Geoffrey W.; Johnson, John Asher; Winn, Joshua N.; Isaacson, Howard; Fischer, Debra A.; Fulton, Benjamin J.; Sinukoff, Evan; Fortney, Jonathan J.","Howard, AW; Sanchis-Ojeda, R; Marcy, GW; Johnson, JA; Winn, JN; Isaacson, H; Fischer, DA; Fulton, BJ; Sinukoff, E; Fortney, JJ",381.0,"[Howard, Andrew W.; Fulton, Benjamin J.; Sinukoff, Evan] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Inst Astron, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Sanchis-Ojeda, Roberto; Winn, Joshua N.] MIT, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Sanchis-Ojeda, Roberto; Winn, Joshua N.] MIT, Kavli Inst Astrophys & Space Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Marcy, Geoffrey W.; Isaacson, Howard] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Astron, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Johnson, John Asher] Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Fischer, Debra A.] Yale Univ, Dept Astron, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Fortney, Jonathan J.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Astron & Astrophys, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12767,Article,1476-4687,howard@ifa.hawaii.edu; rsanchis86@gmail.com,+,NASA's Science Mission Directorate; Kepler Participating Scientist programme; NASA [NNX12AJ23G],"This Letter and another<SUP>10</SUP> were submitted simultaneously and are the result of coordinated, independent radial-velocity observations and analyses of Kepler-78.

114,135,360.0,"Groundwater use in California's San Joaquin Valley exceeds replenishment of the aquifer, leading to substantial diminution of this resource(1-4) and rapid subsidence of the valley floor(5). The volume of groundwater lost over the past century and a half also represents a substantial reduction in mass and a large-scale unburdening of the lithosphere, with significant but unexplored potential impacts on crustal deformation and seismicity. Here we use vertical global positioning system measurements to show that a broad zone of rock uplift of up to 1-3 mm per year surrounds the southern San Joaquin Valley. The observed uplift matches well with predicted flexure from a simple elastic model of current rates of water-storage loss, most of which is caused by groundwater depletion(3). The height of the adjacent central Coast Ranges and the Sierra Nevada is strongly seasonal and peaks during the dry late summer and autumn, out of phase with uplift of the valley floor during wetter months. Our results suggest that long-term and late-summer flexural uplift of the Coast Ranges reduce the effective normal stress resolved on the San Andreas Fault. This process brings the fault closer to failure, thereby providing a viable mechanism for observed seasonality in microseismicity at Parkfield(6) and potentially affecting long-term seismicity rates for fault systems adjacent to the valley. We also infer that the observed contemporary uplift of the southern Sierra Nevada previously attributed to tectonic or mantle-derived forces(7-10) is partly a consequence of human-caused groundwater depletion.","Amos, Colin B.; Audet, Pascal; Hammond, William C.; Buergmann, Roland; Johanson, Ingrid A.; Blewitt, Geoffrey","Amos, CB; Audet, P; Hammond, WC; Burgmann, R; Johanson, IA; Blewitt, G",483.0,"[Amos, Colin B.] Western Washington Univ, Dept Geol, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA; [Audet, Pascal] Univ Ottawa, Dept Earth Sci, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Hammond, William C.; Blewitt, Geoffrey] Univ Nevada, Nevada Geodet Lab, Nevada Bur Mines & Geol, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Hammond, William C.; Blewitt, Geoffrey] Univ Nevada, Nevada Seismol Lab, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Buergmann, Roland; Johanson, Ingrid A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley Seismol Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Buergmann, Roland] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13275,Article,1476-4687,colin.amos@wwu.edu,+,NSF Earth Scope award [EAR-1252210],"Funding for this work comes from NSF Earth Scope award number EAR-1252210 to G.

115,113,104.0,"When used in combination with raster scanning, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) has proven to be a valuable imaging technique of the nanoscale(1), for example of bone, teeth and brain matter(2-5). Although two-dimensional projection imaging has been used to characterize various materials successfully, its three-dimensional extension, SAXS computed tomography, poses substantial challenges, which have yet to be overcome. Previous work(6-11) using SAXS computed tomography was unable to preserve oriented SAXS signals during reconstruction. Here we present a solution to this problem and obtain a complete SAXS computed tomography, which preserves oriented scattering information. By introducing virtual tomography axes, we take advantage of the two-dimensional SAXS information recorded on an area detector and use it to reconstruct the full three-dimensional scattering distribution in reciprocal space for each voxel of the three-dimensional object in real space. The presented method could be of interest for a combined six-dimensional real and reciprocal space characterization of mesoscopic materials with hierarchically structured features with length scales ranging from a few nanometres to a few millimetres-for example, biomaterials such as bone or teeth, or functional materials such as fuel-cell or battery components.","Schaff, Florian; Bech, Martin; Zaslansky, Paul; Jud, Christoph; Liebi, Marianne; Guizar-Sicairos, Manuel; Pfeiffer, Franz","Schaff, F; Bech, M; Zaslansky, P; Jud, C; Liebi, M; Guizar-Sicairos, M; Pfeiffer, F",353.0,"[Schaff, Florian; Jud, Christoph; Pfeiffer, Franz] Tech Univ Munich, Lehrstuhl Biomed Phys, Dept Phys, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Schaff, Florian; Jud, Christoph; Pfeiffer, Franz] Tech Univ Munich, Inst Med Tech, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Bech, Martin] Lund Univ, Dept Med Radiat Phys, Clin Sci, S-22185 Lund, Sweden; [Zaslansky, Paul] Charite, Julius Wolff Inst, D-13353 Berlin, Germany; [Liebi, Marianne; Guizar-Sicairos, Manuel] Paul Scherrer Inst, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland; [Pfeiffer, Franz] Tech Univ Munich, Klinikum Rechts Isar, Inst Diagnost & Interventionelle Radiol, D-81675 Munich, Germany",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature16060,Article,1476-4687,florian.schaff@tum.de; martin.bech@med.lu.se; franz.pfeiffer@tum.de,+,DFG Cluster of Excellence Munich-Centre for Advanced Photonics (MAP); DFG Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz program; DFG (German Research Foundation) [SPP1420]; TUM Graduate School; TUM Institute for Advanced Studies (TUM-IAS),"The SAXS experiments were performed at the cSAXS beamline of the Swiss Light Source (SLS) at the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI), Villigen, Switzerland.

Different lines of evidence, however, suggest that the impact flux from kilometre-sized bodies increased by at least a factor of two over the long-term average during the past similar to,100 Myr. Here we argue that this apparent surge was triggered by the catastrophic disruption of the parent body of the asteroid Baptistina, which we infer was a similar to 170-km-diameter body ( carbonaceous-chondrite-like) that broke up 160(-20)(+30) Myr ago in the inner main asteroid belt. Fragments produced by the collision were slowly delivered by dynamical processes to orbits where they could strike the terrestrial planets. We find that this asteroid shower is the most likely source (. 90 per cent probability) of the Chicxulub impactor that produced the Cretaceous/Tertiary ( K/T) mass extinction event 65 Myr ago.","Bottke, William F.; Vokrouhlicky, David; Nesvorny, David","Bottke, WF; Vokrouhlicky, D; Nesvorny, D",48.0,"SW Res Inst, Boulder, CO 80302 USA; Charles Univ Prague, Inst Astron, CR-18000 Prague 8, Czech Republic",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06070,Article,,bottke@boulder.swri.edu,53,,,207ED,,,NEAR-EARTH OBJECTS; FAMILIES; DISTRIBUTIONS; SIMULATIONS; POPULATION; DISRUPTION; METEORITES; CRATERS; HAZARD; COMETS,7158.0,NATURE,Nature,English,50.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",6-Sep,6.0,LONDON,17805288.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007.0,,"Bottke, WF (reprint author), SW Res Inst, 1050 Walnut St,Suite 300, Boulder, CO 80302 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,88.0,An asteroid breakup 160 Myr ago as the probable source of the K/T impactor,3.0,27.0,WOS:000249233500033,420.0,449,Multidisciplinary Sciences,90,david,nesvorny,11063.0,12593,male,1.0,BeLy4xcAAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",39937576,1,886732,1,Hunt for Exomoons with Kepler,Hunt for Exomoons with Kepler,0,0
117,128,221.0,"Magma fluxes regulate the planetary thermal budget, the growth of continents and the frequency and magnitude of volcanic eruptions, and play a part in the genesis and size of magmatic ore deposits(1-4). However, because a large fraction of the magma produced on the Earth does not erupt at the surface(2,5), determinations of magma fluxes are rare and this compromises our ability to establish a link between global heat transfer and large-scale geological processes. Here we show that age distributions of zircons, a mineral often present in crustal magmatic rocks(6), in combination with thermal modelling, provide an accurate means of retrieving magma fluxes. The characteristics of zircon age populations vary significantly and systematically as a function of the flux and total volume of magma accumulated in the Earth's crust. Our approach produces results that are consistent with independent determinations of magma fluxes and volumes of magmatic systems. Analysis of existing age population data sets using our method suggests that porphyry-type deposits, plutons and large eruptions each require magma input over different timescales at different characteristic average fluxes. We anticipate that more extensive and complete magma flux data sets will serve to clarify the control that the global heat flux exerts on the frequency of geological events such as volcanic eruptions, and to determine the main factors controlling the distribution of resources on our planet.","Caricchi, Luca; Simpson, Guy; Schaltegger, Urs","Caricchi, L; Simpson, G; Schaltegger, U",457.0,"[Caricchi, Luca; Simpson, Guy; Schaltegger, Urs] Univ Geneva, Sect Earth & Environm Sci, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13532,Article,1476-4687,luca.caricchi@unige.ch,+,University of Geneva; Swiss National Science Foundation,"We thank C.

118,137,380.0,"Lignin is a phenylpropanoid-derived heteropolymer important for the strength and rigidity of the plant secondary cell wall(1,2). Genetic disruption of lignin biosynthesis has been proposed as a means to improve forage and bioenergy crops, but frequently results in stunted growth and developmental abnormalities, the mechanisms of which are poorly understood(3). Here we show that the phenotype of a lignin-deficient Arabidopsis mutant is dependent on the transcriptional co-regulatory complex, Mediator. Disruption of the Mediator complex subunits MED5a (also known as REF4) and MED5b (also known as RFR1) rescues the stunted growth, lignin deficiency and widespread changes in gene expression seen in the phenylpropanoid pathway mutant ref8, without restoring the synthesis of guaiacyl and syringyl lignin subunits. Cell walls of rescued med5a/5b ref8 plants instead contain a novel lignin consisting almost exclusively of p-hydroxyphenyl lignin subunits, and moreover exhibit substantially facilitated polysaccharide saccharification. These results demonstrate that guaiacyl and syringyl lignin subunits are largely dispensable for normal growth and development, implicate Mediator in an active transcriptional process responsible for dwarfing and inhibition of lignin biosynthesis, and suggest that the transcription machinery and signalling pathways responding to cell wall defects may be important targets to include in efforts to reduce biomass recalcitrance.","Bonawitz, Nicholas D.; Kim, Jeong Im; Tobimatsu, Yuki; Ciesielski, Peter N.; Anderson, Nickolas A.; Ximenes, Eduardo; Maeda, Junko; Ralph, John; Donohoe, Bryon S.; Ladisch, Michael; Chapple, Clint","Bonawitz, ND; Kim, JI; Tobimatsu, Y; Ciesielski, PN; Anderson, NA; Ximenes, E; Maeda, J; Ralph, J; Donohoe, BS; Ladisch, M; Chapple, C",376.0,"[Bonawitz, Nicholas D.; Kim, Jeong Im; Anderson, Nickolas A.; Maeda, Junko; Chapple, Clint] Purdue Univ, Dept Biochem, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Tobimatsu, Yuki; Ralph, John] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biochem, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Ciesielski, Peter N.; Donohoe, Bryon S.] Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Biosci Ctr, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [Ximenes, Eduardo; Ladisch, Michael] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr & Biol Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Ximenes, Eduardo; Ladisch, Michael] Purdue Univ, Renewable Resources Engn Lab, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Ralph, John] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biol Syst Engn, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Ralph, John] Univ Wisconsin, DOE Great Lakes Bioenergy Res Ctr, Madison, WI 53726 USA; [Ralph, John] Univ Wisconsin, Wisconsin Energy Inst, Madison, WI 53726 USA; [Ladisch, Michael] Purdue Univ, Weldon Sch Biomed Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13084,Article,1476-4687,chapple@purdue.edu,+,"Division of Chemical Sciences, Geosciences, and Biosciences, Office of Basic Energy Sciences of the US Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-FG02-07ER15905]; Life Sciences Research Foundation; US DOE Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center (DOE BER Office of Science) [DE-FC02-07ER64944]; Center for Direct Catalytic Conversion of Biomass to Biofuels (C3Bio), an Energy Frontier Research Center - US DOE, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-SC0000997]; US DOE [DE-FG02-06ER64301]; Purdue University Office of Agricultural Research Programs; Bioinformatics Core at Purdue University","This work was primarily funded by the Division of Chemical Sciences, Geosciences, and Biosciences, Office of Basic Energy Sciences of the US Department of Energy (DOE) through grant DE-FG02-07ER15905 to C.

119,117,426.0,"The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is the major source of variability in winter atmospheric circulation in the Northern Hemisphere, with large impacts on temperature, precipitation and storm tracks(1), and therefore also on strategic sectors such as insurance(2), renewable energy production(3), crop yields(4) and water management(5). Recent developments in dynamical methods offer promise to improve seasonal NAO predictions(6), but assessing potential predictability on multi-annual timescales requires documentation of past low-frequency variability in the NAO. A recent bi-proxy NAO reconstruction(7) spanning the past millennium suggested that long-lasting positive NAO conditions were established during medieval times, explaining the particularly warm conditions in Europe during this period; however, these conclusions are debated. Here, we present a yearly NAO reconstruction for the past millennium, based on an initial selection of 48 annually resolved proxy records distributed around the Atlantic Ocean and built through an ensemble of multivariate regressions. We validate the approach in six past-millenniumclimate simulations, and show that our reconstruction outperforms the bi-proxy index. The final reconstruction shows no persistent positive NAO during the medieval period, but suggests that positive phases were dominant during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The reconstruction also reveals that a positive NAO emerges two years after strong volcanic eruptions, consistent with results obtained from models and satellite observations for the Mt Pinatubo eruption in the Philippines(8,9).","Ortega, Pablo; Lehner, Flavio; Swingedouw, Didier; Masson-Delmotte, Valerie; Raible, Christoph C.; Casado, Mathieu; Yiou, Pascal","Ortega, P; Lehner, F; Swingedouw, D; Masson-Delmotte, V; Raible, CC; Casado, M; Yiou, P",71.0,"[Ortega, Pablo; Masson-Delmotte, Valerie; Casado, Mathieu; Yiou, Pascal] CEA Saclay, UMR CEA CNRS UVSQ 8212, LSCE IPSL, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Lehner, Flavio; Raible, Christoph C.] Univ Bern, Inst Phys, Climate & Environm Phys, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Lehner, Flavio; Raible, Christoph C.] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Swingedouw, Didier] Univ Bordeaux 1, EPOC, F-33615 Pessac, France",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14518,Article,1476-4687,pablo.ortega@lsce.ipsl.fr,+,French ANR CEPS project Green Greenland [ANR-10-CEPL-0008]; NCCR-Climate - Swiss National Science Foundation [200020 147174]; Swedish Research Council [C0629701],"The work of P.O., D.S., V.M.-D. and M.C. has been financially supported by the French ANR CEPS project Green Greenland (ANR-10-CEPL-0008).

120,195,454.0,"Human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) are highly polymorphic proteins that initiate immunity by presenting pathogen-derived peptides to T cells(1). HLA polymorphisms mostly map to the antigen-binding cleft, thereby diversifying the repertoire of self-derived and pathogen-derived peptide antigens selected by different HLA allotypes(2). A growing number of immunologically based drug reactions, including abacavir hypersensitivity syndrome (AHS) and carbamazepine-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), are associated with specific HLA alleles(3-7). However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms of these associations, including AHS, a prototypical HLA-associated drug reaction occurring exclusively in individuals with the common histocompatibility allele HLA-B*57:01, and with a relative risk of more than 1,000 (refs 6, 7). We show that unmodified abacavir binds non-covalently to HLA-B*57:01, lying across the bottom of the antigen-binding cleft and reaching into the F-pocket, where a carboxy-terminal tryptophan typically anchors peptides bound to HLA-B*57:01. Abacavir binds with exquisite specificity to HLA-B*57:01, changing the shape and chemistry of the antigen-binding cleft, thereby altering the repertoire of endogenous peptides that can bind HLA-B*57:01. In this way, abacavir guides the selection of new endogenous peptides, inducing a marked alteration in 'immunological self'. The resultant peptide-centric 'altered self' activates abacavir-specific T-cells, thereby driving polyclonal CD8 T-cell activation and a systemic reaction manifesting as AHS. We also show that carbamazepine, a widely used anti-epileptic drug associated with hypersensitivity reactions in HLA-B*15:02 individuals, binds to this allotype, producing alterations in the repertoire of presented self peptides. Our findings simultaneously highlight the importance of HLA polymorphism in the evolution of pharmacogenomics and provide a general mechanism for some of the growing number of HLA-linked hypersensitivities that involve small-molecule drugs.","Illing, Patricia T.; Vivian, Julian P.; Dudek, Nadine L.; Kostenko, Lyudmila; Chen, Zhenjun; Bharadwaj, Mandvi; Miles, John J.; Kjer-Nielsen, Lars; Gras, Stephanie; Williamson, Nicholas A.; Burrows, Scott R.; Purcell, Anthony W.; Rossjohn, Jamie; McCluskey, James","Illing, PT; Vivian, JP; Dudek, NL; Kostenko, L; Chen, ZJ; Bharadwaj, M; Miles, JJ; Kjer-Nielsen, L; Gras, S; Williamson, NA; Burrows, SR; Purcell, AW; Rossjohn, J; McCluskey, J",554.0,"[Illing, Patricia T.; Kostenko, Lyudmila; Chen, Zhenjun; Bharadwaj, Mandvi; Kjer-Nielsen, Lars; McCluskey, James] Univ Melbourne, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Illing, Patricia T.; Dudek, Nadine L.; Williamson, Nicholas A.; Purcell, Anthony W.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Illing, Patricia T.; Dudek, Nadine L.; Williamson, Nicholas A.; Purcell, Anthony W.] Univ Melbourne, Mol Sci & Biotechnol Inst Bio21, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Vivian, Julian P.; Gras, Stephanie; Rossjohn, Jamie] Monash Univ, Sch Biomed Sci, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Miles, John J.; Burrows, Scott R.] Queensland Inst Med Res, Brisbane, Qld 4029, Australia; [Miles, John J.; Burrows, Scott R.] Australian Ctr Vaccine Dev, Brisbane, Qld 4029, Australia; [Miles, John J.; Rossjohn, Jamie] Cardiff Univ, Sch Med, Inst Infect & Immun, Cardiff CF14 4XN, S Glam, Wales; [McCluskey, James] Australian Red Cross Blood Serv, Victorian Transplantat & Immunogenet Serv, W Melbourne, Vic 3003, Australia",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11147,Article,,apurcell@unimelb.edu.au; jamie.rossjohn@monash.edu; jamesm1@unimelb.edu.au,U158,National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia (NHMRC); Australian Research Council (ARC); Monash University; NHMRC,"We thank R.

121,49,419.0,"A long-standing issue in ecology is reconciling the apparent stability of many populations with robust predictions of large-amplitude population cycles from general theory on consumer resource interactions(1). Even when consumers are decoupled from dynamic resources, large- amplitude cycles can theoretically emerge from delayed feedback processes found in many consumers(2,3). Here we show that resource- dependent mortality and a dynamic developmental delay in consumers produces a new type of small- amplitude cycle that coexists with large- amplitude fluctuations in coupled consumer - resource systems. A distinctive characteristic of the small- amplitude cycles is slow juvenile development for consumers, leading to a developmental delay that is longer than the cycle period. By contrast, the period exceeds the delay in large-amplitude cycles. These theoretical predictions may explain previous empirical results on coexisting attractors found in Daphnia algal systems(4,5). To test this, we used bioassay experiments that measure the growth rates of individuals in populations exhibiting each type of cycle. The results were consistent with predictions. Together, the new theory and experiments establish that two very general features of consumers - a resource- dependent juvenile stage duration and resource- dependent mortality - combine to produce small- amplitude resource - consumer cycles. This phenomenon may contribute to the prevalence of small- amplitude fluctuations in many other consumer - resource populations(6,7).","McCauley, Edward; Nelson, William A.; Nisbet, Roger M.","McCauley, E; Nelson, WA; Nisbet, RM",1240.0,"[McCauley, Edward] Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, Ecol & Evolut Grp, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [Nelson, William A.] Queens Univ, Dept Biol, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada; [Nisbet, Roger M.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07220,Article,,mccauley@ucalgary.ca,1243,NSERC ( Discovery Grants and Accelerator Award); Canada Foundation for Innovation; Canada Research Chairs Program; Alberta Ingenuity; US National Science Foundation [DEB- 0717259],"We acknowledge feedback from A. de Roos, J.

122,430,399.0,"Laboratory evolution has generated many biomolecules with desired properties, but a single round of mutation, gene expression, screening or selection, and replication typically requires days or longer with frequent human intervention(1). Because evolutionary success is dependent on the total number of rounds performed(2), a means of performing laboratory evolution continuously and rapidly could dramatically enhance its effectiveness(3). Although researchers have accelerated individual steps in the evolutionary cycle(4-9), the only previous example of continuous directed evolution was the landmark study of Wright and Joyce(10), who continuously evolved RNA ligase ribozymes with an in vitro replication cycle that unfortunately cannot be easily adapted to other biomolecules. Here we describe a system that enables the continuous directed evolution of gene-encoded molecules that can be linked to protein production in Escherichia coli. During phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE), evolving genes are transferred from host cell to host cell through a modified bacteriophage life cycle in a manner that is dependent on the activity of interest. Dozens of rounds of evolution can occur in a single day of PACE without human intervention. Using PACE, we evolved T7 RNA polymerase (RNAP) variants that recognize a distinct promoter, initiate transcripts with ATP instead of GTP, and initiate transcripts with CTP. In one example, PACE executed 200 rounds of protein evolution over the course of 8 days. Starting from undetectable activity levels in two of these cases, enzymes with each of the three target activities emerged in less than 1 week of PACE. In all three cases, PACE-evolved polymerase activities exceeded or were comparable to that of the wild-type T7 RNAP on its wild-type promoter, representing improvements of up to several hundred-fold. By greatly accelerating laboratory evolution, PACE may provide solutions to otherwise intractable directed evolution problems and address novel questions about molecular evolution.","Esvelt, Kevin M.; Carlson, Jacob C.; Liu, David R.","Esvelt, KM; Carlson, JC; Liu, DR",499.0,"[Carlson, Jacob C.; Liu, David R.] Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Esvelt, Kevin M.] Harvard Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Liu, David R.] Harvard Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09929,Article,,drliu@fas.harvard.edu,U550,National Institutes of Health/National Institute of General Medical Sciences [R01 GM065400]; HHMI; Hertz Foundation; National Science Foundation; Harvard Chemical Biology Graduate Program,"This work was supported by National Institutes of Health/National Institute of General Medical Sciences R01 GM065400 and by HHMI.

123,429,395.0,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are essential components of the innate immune response against intracellular bacteria and it is thought that professional phagocytes generate ROS primarily via the phagosomal NADPH oxidase machinery(1). However, recent studies have suggested that mitochondrial ROS (mROS) also contribute to mouse macrophage bactericidal activity, although the mechanisms linking innate immune signalling to mitochondria for mROS generation remain unclear(2-4). Here we demonstrate that engagement of a subset of Toll-like receptors (TLR1, TLR2 and TLR4) results in the recruitment of mitochondria to macrophage phagosomes and augments mROS production. This response involves translocation of a TLR signalling adaptor, tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), to mitochondria, where it engages the protein ECSIT (evolutionarily conserved signalling intermediate in Toll pathways), which is implicated in mitochondrial respiratory chain assembly(5). Interaction with TRAF6 leads to ECSIT ubiquitination and enrichment at the mitochondrial periphery, resulting in increased mitochondrial and cellular ROS generation. ECSIT-and TRAF6-depleted macrophages have decreased levels of TLR-induced ROS and are significantly impaired in their ability to kill intracellular bacteria. Additionally, reducing macrophage mROS levels by expressing catalase in mitochondria results in defective bacterial killing, confirming the role of mROS in bactericidal activity. These results reveal a novel pathway linking innate immune signalling to mitochondria, implicate mROS as an important component of antibacterial responses and further establish mitochondria as hubs for innate immune signalling.","West, A.

124,10,190.0,"Increased ice velocities in Greenland(1) are contributing significantly to eustatic sea level rise. Faster ice flow has been associated with ice-ocean interactions in water-terminating outlet glaciers(2) and with increased surface meltwater supply to the ice-sheet bed inland. Observed correlations between surface melt and ice acceleration(2-6) have raised the possibility of a positive feedback in which surface melting and accelerated dynamic thinning reinforce one another(7), suggesting that overall warming could lead to accelerated mass loss. Here I show that it is not simply mean surface melt(4) but an increase in water input variability(8) that drives faster ice flow. Glacier sliding responds to melt indirectly through changes in basal water pressure(9-11), with observations showing that water under glaciers drains through channels at low pressure or through interconnected cavities at high pressure(12-15). Using a model that captures the dynamic switching(12) between channel and cavity drainage modes, I show that channelization and glacier deceleration rather than acceleration occur above a critical rate of water flow. Higher rates of steady water supply can therefore suppress rather than enhance dynamic thinning(16), indicating that the melt/dynamic thinning feedback is not universally operational. Shortterm increases in water input are, however, accommodated by the drainage system through temporary spikes in water pressure. It is these spikes that lead to ice acceleration, which is therefore driven by strong diurnal melt cycles(4,14) and an increase in rain and surface lake drainage events(8,17,18) rather than an increase in mean melt supply(3,4).","Schoof, Christian","Schoof, C",803.0,"Univ British Columbia, Dept Earth & Ocean Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09618,Article,,cschoof@eos.ubc.ca,806,Canada Research Chairs; NSERC [357193-08]; Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Science through the Polar Climate Stability Network,"Thanks to G.

125,302,86.0,"The rich fossil record of equids has made them a model for evolutionary processes(1). Here we present a 1.12-times coverage draft genome from a horse bone recovered from permafrost dated to approximately 560-780 thousand years before present (kyr BP)(2,3). Our data represent the oldest full genome sequence determined so far by almost an order of magnitude. For comparison, we sequenced the genome of a Late Pleistocene horse (43 kyr BP), and modern genomes of five domestic horse breeds (Equus ferus caballus), a Przewalski's horse (E. f. prze-walskii) and a donkey (E. asinus). Our analyses suggest that the Equus lineage giving rise to all contemporary horses, zebras and donkeys originated 4.0-4.5 million years before present (Myr BP), twice the conventionally accepted time to the most recent common ancestor of the genus Equus(4,5). We also find that horse population size fluctuated multiple times over the past 2 Myr, particularly during periods of severe climatic changes. We estimate that the Przewalski's and domestic horse populations diverged 38-72 kyr BP, and find no evidence of recent admixture between the domestic horse breeds and the Przewalski's horse investigated. This supports the contention that Przewalski's horses represent the last surviving wild horse population(6). We find similar levels of genetic variation among Przewalski's and domestic populations, indicating that the former are genetically viable and worthy of conservation efforts. We also find evidence for continuous selection on the immune system and olfaction throughout horse evolution. Finally, we identify 29 genomic regions among horse breeds that deviate from neutrality and show low levels of genetic variation compared to the Przewalski's horse. Such regions could correspond to loci selected early during domestication.","Orlando, Ludovic; Ginolhac, Aurelien; Zhang, Guojie; Froese, Duane; Albrechtsen, Anders; Stiller, Mathias; Schubert, Mikkel; Cappellini, Enrico; Petersen, Bent; Moltke, Ida; Johnson, Philip L.

126,271,22.0,"RNA interference is widely distributed in eukaryotes and has a variety of functions, including antiviral defence and gene regulation(1,2). All RNA interference pathways use small single-stranded RNA(ssRNA) molecules that guide proteins of the Argonaute (Ago) family to complementary ssRNA targets: RNA-guided RNA interference(1,2). The role of prokaryotic Ago variants has remained elusive, although bioinformatics analysis has suggested their involvement in host defence(3). Here we demonstrate that Ago of the bacterium Thermus thermophilus (TtAgo) acts as a barrier for the uptake and propagation of foreign DNA. In vivo, TtAgo is loaded with 5'-phosphorylated DNA guides, 13-25 nucleotides in length, that are mostly plasmid derived and have a strong bias for a 5'-end deoxycytidine. These small interfering DNAs guide TtAgo to cleave complementary DNA strands. Hence, despite structural homology to its eukaryotic counterparts, TtAgo functions in host defence by DNA-guided DNA interference.","Swarts, Daan C.; Jore, Matthijs M.; Westra, Edze R.; Zhu, Yifan; Janssen, Jorijn H.; Snijders, Ambrosius P.; Wang, Yanli; Patel, Dinshaw J.; Berenguer, Jose; Brouns, Stan J.

127,107,319.0,"The segregation of axon and dendrite projections into distinct synaptic layers is a fundamental principle of nervous system organization and the structural basis for information processing in the brain(1). Layer- specific recognition molecules that allow projecting neurons to stabilize transient contacts and initiate synaptogenesis(2,3) have been identified. However, most of the neuronal cell- surface molecules critical for layer organization are expressed broadly in the developing nervous system(4,5), raising the question of how these so- called permissive adhesion molecules support synaptic specificity. Here we show that the temporal expression dynamics of the zinc- finger protein sequoia is the major determinant of Drosophila photoreceptor connectivity into distinct synaptic layers. Neighbouring R8 and R7 photoreceptors show consecutive peaks of elevated sequoia expression, which correspond to their sequential target- layer innervation. Loss of sequoia in R7 leads to a projection switch into the R8 recipient layer, whereas a prolonged expression in R8 induces a redirection of their axons into the R7 layer. The sequoia- induced axon targeting is mediated through the ubiquitously expressed Cadherin- N cell adhesion molecule. Our data support a model in which recognition specificity during synaptic layer formation is generated through a temporally restricted axonal competence to respond to broadly expressed adhesion molecules. Because developing neurons innervating the same target area often project in a distinct, birth- order- dependent sequence, temporal identity seems to contain crucial information in generating not only cell type diversity during neuronal division(6) but also connection diversity of projecting neurons.","Petrovic, Milan; Hummel, Thomas","Petrovic, M; Hummel, T",800.0,"[Petrovic, Milan; Hummel, Thomas] Univ Munster, Inst Neurobiol, D-48149 Munster, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07407,Article,,hummel@uni-muenster.de,U87,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB629]; EMBO Young Investigator Programme,"We thank H.

128,207,47.0,"In recent years, several associations between common chronic human disorders and altered gut microbiome composition and function have been reported(1,2). In most of these reports, treatment regimens were not controlled for and conclusions could thus be confounded by the effects of various drugs on the microbiota, which may obscure microbial causes, protective factors or diagnostically relevant signals. Our study addresses disease and drug signatures in the human gut microbiome of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Two previous quantitative gut metagenomics studies of T2D patients that were unstratified for treatment yielded divergent conclusions regarding its associated gut microbial dysbiosis(3,4). Here we show, using 784 available human gut metagenomes, how antidiabetic medication confounds these results, and analyse in detail the effects of the most widely used antidiabetic drug metformin. We provide support for microbial mediation of the therapeutic effects of metformin through short-chain fatty acid production, as well as for potential microbiota-mediated mechanisms behind known intestinal adverse effects in the form of a relative increase in abundance of Escherichia species. Controlling for metformin treatment, we report a unified signature of gut microbiome shifts in T2D with a depletion of butyrate-producing taxa(3,4). These in turn cause functional microbiome shifts, in part alleviated by metformin-induced changes. Overall, the present study emphasizes the need to disentangle gut microbiota signatures of specific human diseases from those of medication.","Forslund, Kristoffer; Hildebrand, Falk; Nielsen, Trine; Falony, Gwen; Le Chatelier, Emmanuelle; Sunagawa, Shinichi; Prifti, Edi; Vieira-Silva, Sara; Gudmundsdottir, Valborg; Pedersen, Helle Krogh; Arumugam, Manimozhiyan; Kristiansen, Karsten; Voigt, Anita Yvonne; Vestergaard, Henrik; Hercog, Rajna; Costea, Paul Igor; Kultima, Jens Roat; Li, Junhua; Jorgensen, Torben; Levenez, Florence; Dore, Joel; Nielsen, H.

129,312,286.0,"Type 1 pili, produced by uropathogenic Escherichia coli, are multi-subunit fibres crucial in recognition of and adhesion to host tissues(1). During pilus biogenesis, subunits are recruited to an outer membrane assembly platform, the FimD usher, which catalyses their polymerization and mediates pilus secretion(2). The recent determination of the crystal structure of an initiation complex provided insight into the initiation step of pilus biogenesis resulting in pore activation, but very little is known about the elongation steps that follow(3). Here, to address this question, we determine the structure of an elongation complex in which the tip complex assembly composed of FimC, FimF, FimG and FimH passes through FimD. This structure demonstrates the conformational changes required to prevent backsliding of the nascent pilus through the FimD pore and also reveals unexpected properties of the usher pore. We show that the circular binding interface between the pore lumen and the folded substrate participates in transport by defining a low-energy pathway along which the nascent pilus polymer is guided during secretion.","Geibel, Sebastian; Procko, Erik; Hultgren, Scott J.; Baker, David; Waksman, Gabriel","Geibel, S; Procko, E; Hultgren, SJ; Baker, D; Waksman, G",243.0,"[Geibel, Sebastian; Waksman, Gabriel] UCL, Inst Struct & Mol Biol, London WC1E 7HX, England; [Geibel, Sebastian; Waksman, Gabriel] Univ London Birkbeck Coll, London WC1E 7HX, England; [Procko, Erik; Baker, David] Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Procko, Erik; Baker, David] Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Hultgren, Scott J.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Womens Infect Dis Res, St Louis, MO 63011 USA; [Hultgren, Scott J.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol Microbiol, St Louis, MO 63011 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12007,Article,,dabaker@u.washington.edu; g.waksman@ucl.ac.uk,+,Medical Research Council [85602]; National Institute of General Medical Studies at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) [P41 GM103533]; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease at the NIH [AI029549],"This work was funded by Medical Research Council grant 85602 to G.

130,14,246.0,"Functional and structural brain imaging has identified neural and neurotransmitter systems involved in schizophrenia and their link to cognitive and behavioural disturbances such as psychosis. Mapping such abnormalities in patients, however, cannot fully capture the strong neurodevelopmental component of schizophrenia that pre-dates manifest illness. A recent strategy to address this issue has been to focus on mechanisms of disease risk. Imaging genetics techniques have made it possible to define neural systems that mediate heritable risk linked to candidate and genome-wide-supported common variants, and mechanisms for environmental risk and gene-environment interactions are emerging.

131,325,444.0,"Genetic and biochemical analyses of RNA interference (RNAi) and microRNA (miRNA) pathways have revealed proteins such as Argonaute and Dicer as essential cofactors that process and present small RNAs to their targets. Well-validated small RNA pathway cofactors such as these show distinctive patterns of conservation or divergence in particular animal, plant, fungal and protist species. We compared 86 divergent eukaryotic genome sequences to discern sets of proteins that show similar phylogenetic profiles with known small RNA cofactors. A large set of additional candidate small RNA cofactors have emerged from functional genomic screens for defects in miRNA-or short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated repression in Caenorhabditis elegans and Dro-sophila melanogaster(1,2), and from proteomic analyses of proteins co-purifying with validated small RNA pathway proteins(3,4). The phylogenetic profiles of many of these candidate small RNA pathway proteins are similar to those of known small RNA cofactor proteins. We used a Bayesian approach to integrate the phylogenetic profile analysis with predictions from diverse transcriptional coregulation and proteome interaction data sets to assign a probability for each protein for a role in a small RNA pathway. Testing high-confidence candidates from this analysis for defects in RNAi silencing, we found that about one-half of the predicted small RNA cofactors are required for RNAi silencing. Many of the newly identified small RNA pathway proteins are orthologues of proteins implicated in RNA splicing. In support of a deep connection between the mechanism of RNA splicing and small-RNA-mediated gene silencing, the presence of the Argonaute proteins and other small RNA components in the many species analysed strongly correlates with the number of introns in those species.","Tabach, Yuval; Billi, Allison C.; Hayes, Gabriel D.; Newman, Martin A.; Zuk, Or; Gabel, Harrison; Kamath, Ravi; Yacoby, Keren; Chapman, Brad; Garcia, Susana M.; Borowsky, Mark; Kim, John K.; Ruvkun, Gary","Tabach, Y; Billi, AC; Hayes, GD; Newman, MA; Zuk, O; Gabel, H; Kamath, R; Yacoby, K; Chapman, B; Garcia, SM; Borowsky, M; Kim, JK; Ruvkun, G",694.0,"[Tabach, Yuval; Hayes, Gabriel D.; Newman, Martin A.; Gabel, Harrison; Kamath, Ravi; Yacoby, Keren; Chapman, Brad; Garcia, Susana M.; Borowsky, Mark; Ruvkun, Gary] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Mol Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Tabach, Yuval; Hayes, Gabriel D.; Newman, Martin A.; Gabel, Harrison; Kamath, Ravi; Garcia, Susana M.; Borowsky, Mark; Ruvkun, Gary] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Billi, Allison C.; Kim, John K.] Univ Michigan, Inst Life Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Billi, Allison C.; Kim, John K.] Univ Michigan, Dept Human Genet, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Zuk, Or] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11779,Article,,ruvkun@molbio.mgh.harvard.edu,698,"NIH [GM088565, GM44619, GM098647]; Pew Charitable Trusts","We thank T.

132,6,109.0,"A challenging goal in materials chemistry and physics is spontaneously to form intended superstructures from designed building blocks. In fields such as crystal engineering(1) and the design of porous materials(2-4), this typically involves building blocks of organic molecules, sometimes operating together with metallic ions or clusters. The translation of such ideas to nanoparticles and colloidal-sized building blocks would potentially open doors to new materials and new properties(5-7), but the pathways to achieve this goal are still undetermined. Here we show how colloidal spheres can be induced to self-assemble into a complex predetermined colloidal crystal-in this case a colloidal kagome lattice(8-12)-through decoration of their surfaces with a simple pattern of hydrophobic domains. The building blocks are simple micrometre-sized spheres with interactions (electrostatic repulsion in the middle, hydrophobic attraction at the poles, which we call 'triblock Janus') that are also simple, but the self-assembly of the spheres into an open kagome structure contrasts with previously known close-packed periodic arrangements of spheres(13-15). This open network is of interest for several theoretical reasons(8-10). With a view to possible enhanced functionality, the resulting lattice structure possesses two families of pores, one that is hydrophobic on the rims of the pores and another that is hydrophilic. This strategy of 'convergent' self-assembly from easily fabricated(16) colloidal building blocks encodes the target supracolloidal architecture, not in localized attractive spots but instead in large redundantly attractive regions, and can be extended to form other supracolloidal networks.","Chen, Qian; Bae, Sung Chul; Granick, Steve","Chen, Q; Bae, SC; Granick, S",381.0,"[Chen, Qian; Bae, Sung Chul; Granick, Steve] Univ Illinois, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Granick, Steve] Univ Illinois, Dept Chem, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Granick, Steve] Univ Illinois, Dept Phys, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09713,Article,,sgranick@illinois.edu,384,"US Department of Energy, Division of Materials Science through the Frederick Seitz Materials Research Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign [DE-FG02-07ER46471]","This work was supported by the US Department of Energy, Division of Materials Science, under award number DE-FG02-07ER46471 through the Frederick Seitz Materials Research Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

134,303,125.0,"Detection of cytoplasmic DNA represents one of the most fundamental mechanisms of the innate immune system to sense the presence of microbial pathogens(1). Moreover, erroneous detection of endogenous DNA by the same sensing mechanisms has an important pathophysiological role in certain sterile inflammatory conditions(2,3). The endoplasmic-reticulum-resident protein STING is critically required for the initiation of type I interferon signalling upon detection of cytosolic DNA of both exogenous and endogenous origin(4-8). Next to its pivotal role in DNA sensing, STING also serves as a direct receptor for the detection of cyclic dinucleotides, which function as second messenger molecules in bacteria(9-13). DNA recognition, however, is triggered in an indirect fashion that depends on a recently characterized cytoplasmic nucleotidyl transferase, termed cGAMP synthase (cGAS), which upon interaction with DNA synthesizes a dinucleotide molecule that in turn binds to and activates STING(14,15). We here show in vivo and in vitro that the cGAS-catalysed reaction product is distinct from previously characterized cyclic dinucleotides. Using a combinatorial approach based on mass spectrometry, enzymatic digestion, NMR analysis and chemical synthesis we demonstrate that cGAS produces a cyclic GMP-AMP dinucleotide, which comprises a 2'-5' and a 3'-5' phosphodiester linkage. Gp(2'-5') Ap(3'-5')>. We found that the presence of this 2'-5' linkage was required to exert potent activation of human STING. Moreover, we show that cGAS first catalyses the synthesis of a linear 2'-5'-linked dinucleotide, which is then subject to cGAS-dependent cyclization in a second step through a 3'-5' phosphodiester linkage. This 13-membered ring structure defines a novel class of second messenger molecules, extending the family of 2'-5'-linked antiviral biomolecules.","Ablasser, Andrea; Goldeck, Marion; Cavlar, Taner; Deimling, Tobias; Witte, Gregor; Roehl, Ingo; Hopfner, Karl-Peter; Ludwig, Janos; Hornung, Veit","Ablasser, A; Goldeck, M; Cavlar, T; Deimling, T; Witte, G; Rohl, I; Hopfner, KP; Ludwig, J; Hornung, V",380.0,"[Ablasser, Andrea; Goldeck, Marion; Cavlar, Taner; Ludwig, Janos; Hornung, Veit] Univ Bonn, Univ Hosp, Inst Clin Chem & Clin Pharmacol, D-53127 Bonn, Germany; [Deimling, Tobias; Witte, Gregor; Hopfner, Karl-Peter] Univ Munich, Dept Biochem, D-81377 Munich, Germany; [Deimling, Tobias; Witte, Gregor; Hopfner, Karl-Peter] Univ Munich, Gene Ctr, D-81377 Munich, Germany; [Roehl, Ingo] Axolabs GmbH, D-95326 Kulmbach, Germany; [Hopfner, Karl-Peter] Ctr Integrated Prot Sci, D-81377 Munich, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12306,Article,,andrea.ablasser@uni-bonn.de; veit.hornung@uni-bonn.de,+,"National Institutes of Health [U19AI083025]; European Research Council [322869, ERC 243046]; Center for Integrated Protein Science Munich (CIPSM); German Research Foundation [SFB670]","We thank M.

Wild-type PGCs revealed marked genome-wide erasure of methylation to a level below that of methylation deficient (Np95(-/-), also called Uhrf1(-/-)) embryonic stem cells, with female PGCs being less methylated than male ones. By contrast, AID-deficient PGCs were up to three times more methylated than wild-type ones; this substantial difference occurred throughout the genome, with introns, intergenic regions and transposons being relatively more methylated than exons. Relative hypermethylation in AID-deficient PGCs was confirmed by analysis of individual loci in the genome. Our results reveal that erasure of DNA methylation in the germ line is a global process, hence limiting the potential for transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. AID deficiency interferes with genome-wide erasure of DNA methylation patterns, indicating that AID has a critical function in epigenetic reprogramming and potentially in restricting the inheritance of epimutations in mammals.","Popp, Christian; Dean, Wendy; Feng, Suhua; Cokus, Shawn J.; Andrews, Simon; Pellegrini, Matteo; Jacobsen, Steven E.; Reik, Wolf","Popp, C; Dean, W; Feng, SH; Cokus, SJ; Andrews, S; Pellegrini, M; Jacobsen, SE; Reik, W",1101.0,"[Feng, Suhua; Cokus, Shawn J.; Pellegrini, Matteo; Jacobsen, Steven E.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Mol Cell & Dev Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Popp, Christian; Dean, Wendy; Reik, Wolf] Babraham Inst, Lab Dev Genet & Imprinting, Cambridge CB22 3AT, England; [Popp, Christian; Dean, Wendy; Reik, Wolf] Univ Cambridge, Ctr Trophoblast Res, Cambridge CB2 3EG, England; [Andrews, Simon] Babraham Inst, Bioinformat Grp, Cambridge CB22 3AT, England; [Jacobsen, Steven E.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08829,Article,,jacobsen@ucla.edu; wolf.reik@bbsrc.ac.uk,U126,BBSRC; MRC; EU NoE The Epigenome; CellCentric; HHMI; NSF; NIH,"We thank H.

136,345,128.0,"Unlike random heteropolymers, natural proteins fold into unique ordered structures. Understanding how these are encoded in amino-acid sequences is complicated by energetically unfavourable non-ideal features-for example kinked alpha-helices, bulged beta-strands, strained loops and buried polar groups-that arise in proteins from evolutionary selection for biological function or from neutral drift. Here we describe an approach to designing ideal protein structures stabilized by completely consistent local and non-local interactions. The approach is based on a set of rules relating secondary structure patterns to protein tertiary motifs, which make possible the design of funnel-shaped protein folding energy landscapes leading into the target folded state. Guided by these rules, we designed sequences predicted to fold into ideal protein structures consisting of alpha-helices, beta-strands and minimal loops. Designs for five different topologies were found to be monomeric and very stable and to adopt structures in solution nearly identical to the computational models. These results illuminate how the folding funnels of natural proteins arise and provide the foundation for engineering a new generation of functional proteins free from natural evolution.","Koga, Nobuyasu; Tatsumi-Koga, Rie; Liu, Gaohua; Xiao, Rong; Acton, Thomas B.; Montelione, Gaetano T.; Baker, David","Koga, N; Tatsumi-Koga, R; Liu, GH; Xiao, R; Acton, TB; Montelione, GT; Baker, D",222.0,"[Koga, Nobuyasu; Tatsumi-Koga, Rie; Baker, David] Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Koga, Nobuyasu; Tatsumi-Koga, Rie; Baker, David] Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Liu, Gaohua; Xiao, Rong; Acton, Thomas B.; Montelione, Gaetano T.] Rutgers State Univ, Ctr Adv Biotechnol & Med, Dept Mol Biol & Biochem, NE Struct Genom Consortium, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; [Liu, Gaohua; Xiao, Rong; Acton, Thomas B.; Montelione, Gaetano T.] Univ Med & Dent New Jersey, Robert Wood Johnson Med Sch, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11600,Article,1476-4687,guy@cabm.rutgers.edu; dabaker@u.washington.edu,227,HHMI; DOE; DARPA; DTRA; National Institutes of General Medical Science Protein Structure Initiative (PSI: Biology) programme [U54 GM094597]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Postdoctoral Fellowships for Research Abroad,"We thank N.

137,311,281.0,"Behavioural states in mammals, such as the anxious state, are characterized by several features that are coordinately regulated by diverse nervous system outputs, ranging from behavioural choice patterns to changes in physiology (in anxiety, exemplified respectively by risk-avoidance and respiratory rate alterations)(1,2). Here we investigate if and how defined neural projections arising from a single coordinating brain region in mice could mediate diverse features of anxiety. Integrating behavioural assays, in vivo and in vitro electrophysiology, respiratory physiology and optogenetics, we identify a surprising new role for the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) in the coordinated modulation of diverse anxiety features. First, two BNST subregions were unexpectedly found to exert opposite effects on the anxious state: oval BNST activity promoted several independent anxious state features, whereas anterodorsal BNST-associated activity exerted anxiolytic influence for the same features. Notably, we found that three distinct anterodorsal BNST efferent projections-to the lateral hypothalamus, parabrachial nucleus and ventral tegmental area-each implemented an independent feature of anxiolysis: reduced risk-avoidance, reduced respiratory rate, and increased positive valence, respectively. Furthermore, selective inhibition of corresponding circuit elements in freely moving mice showed opposing behavioural effects compared with excitation, and in vivo recordings during free behaviour showed native spiking patterns in anterodorsal BNST neurons that differentiated safe and anxiogenic environments. These results demonstrate that distinct BNST subregions exert opposite effects in modulating anxiety, establish separable anxiolytic roles for different anterodorsal BNST projections, and illustrate circuit mechanisms underlying selection of features for the assembly of the anxious state.","Kim, Sung-Yon; Adhikari, Avishek; Lee, Soo Yeun; Marshel, James H.; Kim, Christina K.; Mallory, Caitlin S.; Lo, Maisie; Pak, Sally; Mattis, Joanna; Lim, Byung Kook; Malenka, Robert C.; Warden, Melissa R.; Neve, Rachael; Tye, Kay M.; Deisseroth, Karl","Kim, SY; Adhikari, A; Lee, SY; Marshel, JH; Kim, CK; Mallory, CS; Lo, M; Pak, S; Mattis, J; Lim, BK; Malenka, RC; Warden, MR; Neve, R; Tye, KM; Deisseroth, K",219.0,"[Kim, Sung-Yon; Adhikari, Avishek; Lee, Soo Yeun; Marshel, James H.; Kim, Christina K.; Mallory, Caitlin S.; Lo, Maisie; Pak, Sally; Mattis, Joanna; Warden, Melissa R.; Tye, Kay M.; Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Dept Bioengn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kim, Sung-Yon; Kim, Christina K.; Mallory, Caitlin S.; Mattis, Joanna; Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Neurosci Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lee, Soo Yeun; Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, CNC Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lim, Byung Kook; Malenka, Robert C.; Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Neve, Rachael; Tye, Kay M.] MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12018,Article,,deissero@stanford.edu,223,Samsung Scholarship; US National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH); Berry Fellowship; NARSAD; Wiegers Family Fund; NIMH; US National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA); DARPA REPAIR Program; Keck Foundation; McKnight Foundation; Gatsby Charitable Foundation; Snyder Foundation; Woo Foundation; Tarlton Foundation; Albert Yu and Mary Bechman Foundation,"We thank M.

138,46,225.0,"Randomness is a fundamental feature of nature and a valuable resource for applications ranging from cryptography and gambling to numerical simulation of physical and biological systems. Random numbers, however, are difficult to characterize mathematically(1), and their generation must rely on an unpredictable physical process(2-6). Inaccuracies in the theoretical modelling of such processes or failures of the devices, possibly due to adversarial attacks, limit the reliability of random number generators in ways that are difficult to control and detect. Here, inspired by earlier work on non-locality-based(7-9) and device-independent(10-14) quantum information processing, we show that the non-local correlations of entangled quantum particles can be used to certify the presence of genuine randomness. It is thereby possible to design a cryptographically secure random number generator that does not require any assumption about the internal working of the device. Such a strong form of randomness generation is impossible classically and possible in quantum systems only if certified by a Bell inequality violation(15). We carry out a proof-of-concept demonstration of this proposal in a system of two entangled atoms separated by approximately one metre. The observed Bell inequality violation, featuring near perfect detection efficiency, guarantees that 42 new random numbers are generated with 99 per cent confidence. Our results lay the groundwork for future device-independent quantum information experiments and for addressing fundamental issues raised by the intrinsic randomness of quantum theory.","Pironio, S.; Acin, A.; Massar, S.; de la Giroday, A.

139,109,335.0,"The lymphatic system plays a key role in tissue fluid regulation and tumour metastasis, and lymphatic defects underlie many pathological states including lymphoedema, lymphangiectasia, lymphangioma and lymphatic dysplasia(1-3). However, the origins of the lymphatic system in the embryo, and the mechanisms that direct growth of the network of lymphatic vessels, remain unclear. Lymphatic vessels are thought to arise from endothelial precursor cells budding from the cardinal vein under the influence of the lymphatic hallmark gene Prox1 ( prospero homeobox 1; ref. 4). Defects in the transcription factor gene SOX18 ( SRY ( sex determining region Y) box 18) cause lymphatic dysfunction in the human syndrome hypotrichosis- lymphoedema- telangiectasia(5), suggesting that Sox18 may also play a role in lymphatic development or function. Here we use molecular, cellular and genetic assays in mice to show that Sox18 acts as a molecular switch to induce differentiation of lymphatic endothelial cells. Sox18 is expressed in a subset of cardinal vein cells that later co- express Prox1 and migrate to form lymphatic vessels. Sox18 directly activates Prox1 transcription by binding to its proximal promoter. Overexpression of Sox18 in blood vascular endothelial cells induces them to express Prox1 and other lymphatic endothelial markers, while Sox18- null embryos show a complete blockade of lymphatic endothelial cell differentiation from the cardinal vein. Our findings demonstrate a critical role for Sox18 in developmental lymphangiogenesis, and suggest new avenues to investigate for therapeutic management of human lymphangiopathies.","Francois, Mathias; Caprini, Andrea; Hosking, Brett; Orsenigo, Fabrizio; Wilhelm, Dagmar; Browne, Catherine; Paavonen, Karri; Karnezis, Tara; Shayan, Ramin; Downes, Meredith; Davidson, Tara; Tutt, Desmond; Cheah, Kathryn S.

Impressive progress has been achieved in isolating quantum systems from the environment and coherently controlling their dynamics, as demonstrated by the creation and manipulation of entanglement in various physical systems. However, for open quantum systems, engineering the dynamics of many particles by a controlled coupling to an environment remains largely unexplored. Here we realize an experimental toolbox for simulating an open quantum system with up to five quantum bits (qubits). Using a quantum computing architecture with trapped ions, we combine multi-qubit gates with optical pumping to implement coherent operations and dissipative processes. We illustrate our ability to engineer the open-system dynamics through the dissipative preparation of entangled states, the simulation of coherent many-body spin interactions, and the quantum non-demolition measurement of multi-qubit observables.

141,192,64.0,"Resistance to infection and clearance of cell debris in mammals depend on the activation of the complement system, which is an important component of innate and adaptive immunity(1,2). Central to the complement system is the activated form of C3, called C3b, which attaches covalently to target surfaces(3) to amplify complement response, label cells for phagocytosis and stimulate the adaptive immune response. C3b consists of 1,560 amino-acid residues and has 12 domains. It binds various proteins and receptors to effect its functions(4). However, it is not known how C3 changes its conformation into C3b and thereby exposes its many binding sites. Here we present the crystal structure at 4-angstrom resolution of the activated complement protein C3b and describe the conformational rearrangements of the 12 domains that take place upon proteolytic activation. In the activated form the thioester is fully exposed for covalent attachment to target surfaces and is more than 85 angstrom away from the buried site in native C3 (ref. 5). Marked domain rearrangements in the alpha-chain present an altered molecular surface, exposing hidden and cryptic sites that are consistent with known putative binding sites of factor B and several complement regulators. The structural data indicate that the large conformational changes in the proteolytic activation and regulation of C3 take place mainly in the first conversion step, from C3 to C3b. These insights are important for the development of strategies to treat immune disorders that involve complement-mediated inflammation.","Janssen, Bert J.

142,396,363.0,"Human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) are a promising source of cells for applications in regenerative medicine. Directed differentiation of PSCs into specialized cells such as spinal motoneurons(1) or midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons(2) has been achieved. However, the effective use of PSCs for cell therapy has lagged behind. Whereas mouse PSC-derived DA neurons have shown efficacy in models of Parkinson's disease(3,4), DA neurons from human PSCs generally show poor in vivo performance(5). There are also considerable safety concerns for PSCs related to their potential for teratoma formation or neural overgrowth(6,7). Here we present a novel floor-plate-based strategy for the derivation of human DA neurons that efficiently engraft in vivo, suggesting that past failures were due to incomplete specification rather than a specific vulnerability of the cells. Midbrain floor-plate precursors are derived from PSCs 11 days after exposure to small molecule activators of sonic hedgehog (SHH) and canonical WNT signalling. Engraftable midbrain DA neurons are obtained by day 25 and can be maintained in vitro for several months. Extensive molecular profiling, biochemical and electrophysiological data define developmental progression and confirm identity of PSC-derived midbrain DA neurons. In vivo survival and function is demonstrated in Parkinson's disease models using three host species. Long-term engraftment in 6-hydroxy-dopamine-lesioned mice and rats demonstrates robust survival of midbrain DA neurons derived from human embryonic stem (ES) cells, complete restoration of amphetamine-induced rotation behaviour and improvements in tests of forelimb use and akinesia. Finally, scalability is demonstrated by transplantation into parkinsonian monkeys. Excellent DA neuron survival, function and lack of neural overgrowth in the three animal models indicate promise for the development of cell-based therapies in Parkinson's disease.","Kriks, Sonja; Shim, Jae-Won; Piao, Jinghua; Ganat, Yosif M.; Wakeman, Dustin R.; Xie, Zhong; Carrillo-Reid, Luis; Auyeung, Gordon; Antonacci, Chris; Buch, Amanda; Yang, Lichuan; Beal, M.

143,54,298.0,"Cellular senescence has been recently shown to have an important role in opposing tumour initiation and promotion. Senescence induced by oncogenes or by loss of tumour suppressor genes is thought to critically depend on induction of the p19(Arf)-p53 pathway. The Skp2 E3-ubiquitin ligase can act as a proto-oncogene and its aberrant overexpression is frequently observed in human cancers. Here we show that although Skp2 inactivation on its own does not induce cellular senescence, aberrant proto-oncogenic signals as well as inactivation of tumour suppressor genes do trigger a potent, tumour-suppressive senescence response in mice and cells devoid of Skp2. Notably, Skp2 inactivation and oncogenic-stress-driven senescence neither elicit activation of the p19(Arf)-p53 pathway nor DNA damage, but instead depend on Atf4, p27 and p21. We further demonstrate that genetic Skp2 inactivation evokes cellular senescence even in oncogenic conditions in which the p19(Arf)-p53 response is impaired, whereas a Skp2-SCF complex inhibitor can trigger cellular senescence in p53/Pten-deficient cells and tumour regression in preclinical studies. Our findings therefore provide proof-of-principle evidence that pharmacological inhibition of Skp2 may represent a general approach for cancer prevention and therapy.","Lin, Hui-Kuan; Chen, Zhenbang; Wang, Guocan; Nardella, Caterina; Lee, Szu-Wei; Chan, Chan-Hsin; Yang, Wei-Lei; Wang, Jing; Egia, Ainara; Nakayama, Keiichi I.; Cordon-Cardo, Carlos; Teruya-Feldstein, Julie; Pandolfi, Pier Paolo","Lin, HK; Chen, ZB; Wang, GC; Nardella, C; Lee, SW; Chan, CH; Yang, WL; Wang, J; Egia, A; Nakayama, KI; Cordon-Cardo, C; Teruya-Feldstein, J; Pandolfi, PP",374.0,"[Lin, Hui-Kuan; Chen, Zhenbang; Wang, Guocan; Nardella, Caterina; Pandolfi, Pier Paolo] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Sloan Kettering Inst, Canc Biol & Genet Program, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Lin, Hui-Kuan; Chen, Zhenbang; Wang, Guocan; Nardella, Caterina; Cordon-Cardo, Carlos; Teruya-Feldstein, Julie; Pandolfi, Pier Paolo] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Sloan Kettering Inst, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Lin, Hui-Kuan; Lee, Szu-Wei; Chan, Chan-Hsin; Yang, Wei-Lei; Wang, Jing] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Mol & Cellular Oncol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Chen, Zhenbang; Wang, Guocan; Nardella, Caterina; Egia, Ainara] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Chen, Zhenbang; Wang, Guocan; Nardella, Caterina; Egia, Ainara] Beth Israel Deaconess Canc Ctr, Canc Genet Program, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Nakayama, Keiichi I.] Kyushu Univ, Med Inst Bioregulat, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Fukuoka 8128582, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08815,Article,,ppandolf@bidmc.harvard.edu,U66,NIH; Anderson Trust Scholar Award; DOD Prostate Cancer New Investigator Award,"We are grateful to C.

144,29,473.0,"In the oceans, ubiquitous microscopic phototrophs (phytoplankton) account for approximately half the production of organic matter on Earth. Analyses of satellite-derived phytoplankton concentration (available since 1979) have suggested decadal-scale fluctuations linked to climate forcing, but the length of this record is insufficient to resolve longer-term trends. Here we combine available ocean transparency measurements and in situ chlorophyll observations to estimate the time dependence of phytoplankton biomass at local, regional and global scales since 1899. We observe declines in eight out of ten ocean regions, and estimate a global rate of decline of similar to 1% of the global median per year. Our analyses further reveal interannual to decadal phytoplankton fluctuations superimposed on long-term trends. These fluctuations are strongly correlated with basin-scale climate indices, whereas long-term declining trends are related to increasing sea surface temperatures. We conclude that global phytoplankton concentration has declined over the past century; this decline will need to be considered in future studies of marine ecosystems, geochemical cycling, ocean circulation and fisheries.","Boyce, Daniel G.; Lewis, Marlon R.; Worm, Boris","Boyce, DG; Lewis, MR; Worm, B",591.0,"[Boyce, Daniel G.; Worm, Boris] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS B3H 4J1, Canada; [Lewis, Marlon R.] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Oceanog, Halifax, NS B3H 4J1, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09268,Article,1476-4687,dboyce@dal.ca,596,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; US Office of Naval Research; Canada Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences; National Aeronautics and Space Administration; Sloan Foundation; Lenfest Ocean Program,"We are grateful to all data providers, to J.

145,118,62.0,"Motility is a universal property of newly generated neurons. How cell migration is coordinately regulated with other aspects of neuron production is not well understood. Here we show that the proneural protein neurogenin 2 ( Neurog2), which controls neurogenesis in the embryonic cerebral cortex(1,2), directly induces the expression of the small GTP- binding protein Rnd2 ( ref. 3) in newly generated mouse cortical neurons before they initiate migration. Rnd2 silencing leads to a defect in radial migration of cortical neurons similar to that observed when the Neurog2 gene is deleted. Remarkably, restoring Rnd2 expression in Neurog2- mutant neurons is sufficient to rescue their ability to migrate. Our results identify Rnd2 as a novel essential regulator of neuronal migration in the cerebral cortex and demonstrate that Rnd2 is a major effector of Neurog2 function in the promotion of migration. Thus, a proneural protein controls the complex cellular behaviour of cell migration through a remarkably direct pathway involving the transcriptional activation of a small GTP- binding protein.","Heng, Julian Ik-Tsen; Nguyen, Laurent; Castro, Diogo S.; Zimmer, Celine; Wildner, Hendrik; Armant, Olivier; Skowronska-Krawczyk, Dorota; Bedogni, Francesco; Matter, Jean-Marc; Hevner, Robert; Guillemot, Francois","Heng, JIT; Nguyen, L; Castro, DS; Zimmer, C; Wildner, H; Armant, O; Skowronska-Krawczyk, D; Bedogni, F; Matter, JM; Hevner, R; Guillemot, F",114.0,"[Heng, Julian Ik-Tsen; Nguyen, Laurent; Castro, Diogo S.; Zimmer, Celine; Wildner, Hendrik; Armant, Olivier; Guillemot, Francois] Natl Inst Med Res, Div Mol Neurobiol, London NW7 1AA, England; [Skowronska-Krawczyk, Dorota; Matter, Jean-Marc] Univ Geneva, Dept Biochem, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland; [Bedogni, Francesco; Hevner, Robert] Univ Washington, Harborview Med Ctr, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Seattle, WA 98104 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07198,Article,,fguille@nimr.mrc.ac.uk,U82,Australian CJ Martin Fellowship [310616]; Medical Research Council career development fellowship; European Molecular Biology Organization; Medical Research Council career development fellowships; European Commission 6th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development; Medical Research Council,"We are grateful to S.

The sophisticated functions of these molecular machines have inspired the development of methods to engineer self-assembling protein nanostructures; however, the design of multi-component protein nanomaterials with high accuracy remains an outstanding challenge. Here we report a computational method for designing protein nanomaterials in which multiple copies of two distinct subunits co-assemble into a specific architecture. We use the method to design five 24-subunit cage-like protein nanomaterials in two distinct symmetric architectures and experimentally demonstrate that their structures are in close agreement with the computational design models.

147,210,71.0,"One of the most important questions in biology is how transcription factors (TFs) and cofactors control enhancer function and thus gene expression. Enhancer activation usually requires combinations of several TFs(1), indicating that TFs function synergistically and combinatorially(2,3). However, while TF binding has been extensively studied, little is known about how combinations of TFs and cofactors control enhancer function once they are bound. It is typically unclear which TFs participate in combinatorial enhancer activation, whether different TFs form functionally distinct groups, or if certain TFs might substitute for each other in defined enhancer contexts. Here we assess the potential regulatory contributions of TFs and cofactors to combinatorial enhancer control with enhancer complementation assays. We recruited GAL4-DNA-binding-domain fusions of 812 Drosophila TFs and cofactors to 24 enhancer contexts and measured enhancer activities by 82,752 luciferase assays in S2 cells. Most factors were functional in at least one context, yet their contributions differed between contexts and varied from repression to activation (up to 289-fold) for individual factors. Based on functional similarities across contexts, we define 15 groups of TFs that differ in developmental functions and protein sequence features. Similar TFs can substitute for each other, enabling enhancer re-engineering by exchanging TF motifs, and TF-cofactor pairs cooperate during enhancer control and interact physically. Overall, we show that activators and repressors can have diverse regulatory functions that typically depend on the enhancer context. The systematic functional characterization of TFs and cofactors should further our understanding of combinatorial enhancer control and gene regulation.","Stampfel, Gerald; Kazmar, Tomas; Frank, Olga; Wienerroither, Sebastian; Reiter, Franziska; Stark, Alexander","Stampfel, G; Kazmar, T; Frank, O; Wienerroither, S; Reiter, F; Stark, A",147.0,"[Stampfel, Gerald; Kazmar, Tomas; Frank, Olga; Wienerroither, Sebastian; Reiter, Franziska; Stark, Alexander] Vienna Bioctr VBC, Res Inst Mol Pathol IMP, A-1030 Vienna, Austria",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15545,Article,1476-4687,stark@starklab.org,+,European Research Council (ERC) [242922]; Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH; Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG),"We are grateful to K.

148,326,457.0,"Major depression is characterized by diverse debilitating symptoms that include hopelessness and anhedonia(1). Dopamine neurons involved in reward and motivation(2-9) are among many neural populations that have been hypothesized to be relevant(10), and certain antidepressant treatments, including medications and brain stimulation therapies, can influence the complex dopamine system. Until now it has not been possible to test this hypothesis directly, even in animal models, as existing therapeutic interventions are unable to specifically target dopamine neurons. Here we investigated directly the causal contributions of defined dopamine neurons to multidimensional depression-like phenotypes induced by chronic mild stress, by integrating behavioural, pharmacological, optogenetic and electrophysiological methods in freely moving rodents. We found that bidirectional control (inhibition or excitation) of specified midbrain dopamine neurons immediately and bidirectionally modulates (induces or relieves) multiple independent depression symptoms caused by chronic stress. By probing the circuit implementation of these effects, we observed that optogenetic recruitment of these dopamine neurons potently alters the neural encoding of depression-related behaviours in the downstream nucleus accumbens of freely moving rodents, suggesting that processes affecting depression symptoms may involve alterations in the neural encoding of action in limbic circuitry.","Tye, Kay M.; Mirzabekov, Julie J.; Warden, Melissa R.; Ferenczi, Emily A.; Tsai, Hsing-Chen; Finkelstein, Joel; Kim, Sung-Yon; Adhikari, Avishek; Thompson, Kimberly R.; Andalman, Aaron S.; Gunaydin, Lisa A.; Witten, Ilana B.; Deisseroth, Karl","Tye, KM; Mirzabekov, JJ; Warden, MR; Ferenczi, EA; Tsai, HC; Finkelstein, J; Kim, SY; Adhikari, A; Thompson, KR; Andalman, AS; Gunaydin, LA; Witten, IB; Deisseroth, K",537.0,"[Tye, Kay M.] MIT, Picower Inst Learning & Memory Brain & Cognit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Tye, Kay M.; Mirzabekov, Julie J.; Warden, Melissa R.; Ferenczi, Emily A.; Tsai, Hsing-Chen; Finkelstein, Joel; Kim, Sung-Yon; Adhikari, Avishek; Thompson, Kimberly R.; Andalman, Aaron S.; Gunaydin, Lisa A.; Witten, Ilana B.; Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Dept Bioengn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Ferenczi, Emily A.; Tsai, Hsing-Chen; Kim, Sung-Yon; Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Neurosci Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, CNC Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11740,Article,,kaytye@mit.edu; deissero@stanford.edu,+,Helen Hay Whitney Foundation; NRSA [F32 MH880102]; JPB Foundation; NARSAD; Wiegers Family Fund; NIMH; NIDA; DARPA REPAIR Program; Keck Foundation; McKnight Foundation; Gatsby Charitable Foundation; Snyder Foundation; Woo Foundation; Albert Yu and Mary Bechman Foundation,"We thank T.

149,15,279.0,"An individual magnetic atom doped into a semiconductor is a promising building block for bottom-up spintronic devices and quantum-logic gates(1-3). Moreover, it provides a perfect model system for the atomic-scale investigation of fundamental effects such as magnetism in dilute magnetic semiconductors(4). However, dopants in semiconductors so far have not been studied by magnetically sensitive techniques with atomic resolution that correlate the atomic structure with the dopant's magnetism. Here we show electrical excitation and read-out of a spin associated with a single magnetic dopant in a semiconductor host. We use spin-resolved scanning tunnelling spectroscopy to measure the spin excitations and the magnetization curve of individual iron surface-dopants embedded within a two-dimensional electron gas confined to an indium antimonide (110) surface. The dopants act like isolated quantum spins the states of which are governed by a substantial magnetic anisotropy that forces the spin to lie in the surface plane. This result is corroborated by our first principles calculations. The demonstrated methodology opens new routes for the investigation of sample systems that are more widely studied in the field of spintronics-that is, Mn in GaAs (ref. 5), magnetic ions in semiconductor quantum dots(3), nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond(6) and phosphorus spins in silicon(7).","Khajetoorians, Alexander A.; Chilian, Bruno; Wiebe, Jens; Schuwalow, Sergej; Lechermann, Frank; Wiesendanger, Roland","Khajetoorians, AA; Chilian, B; Wiebe, J; Schuwalow, S; Lechermann, F; Wiesendanger, R",1084.0,"[Khajetoorians, Alexander A.; Chilian, Bruno; Wiebe, Jens; Wiesendanger, Roland] Univ Hamburg, Inst Appl Phys, D-20355 Hamburg, Germany; [Schuwalow, Sergej; Lechermann, Frank] Univ Hamburg, Inst Theoret Phys 1, D-20355 Hamburg, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09519,Article,,jwiebe@physnet.uni-hamburg.de,1087,ERC; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB668]; Graduiertenkolleg [1286]; City of Hamburg via the cluster of excellence,"J.W. would like to thank M.

150,335,25.0,"There is a recognized need to anticipate tipping points, or critical transitions, in social-ecological systems(1,2). Studies of mathematical(3-5) and experimental(6-9) systems have shown that systems may 'wobble' before a critical transition. Such early warning signals(10) may be due to the phenomenon of critical slowing down, which causes a system to recover slowly from small impacts, or to a flickering phenomenon, which causes a system to switch back and forth between alternative states in response to relatively large impacts. Such signals for transitions in social-ecological systems have rarely been observed(11), not the least because high-resolution time series are normally required. Here we combine empirical data from a lake-catchment system with a mathematical model and show that flickering can be detected from sparse data. We show how rising variance coupled to decreasing autocorrelation and skewness started 10-30 years before the transition to eutrophic lake conditions in both the empirical records and the model output, a finding that is consistent with flickering rather than critical slowing down(4,12). Our results suggest that if environmental regimes are sufficiently affected by large external impacts that flickering is induced, then early warning signals of transitions in modern social-ecological systems may be stronger, and hence easier to identify, than previously thought.","Wang, Rong; Dearing, John A.; Langdon, Peter G.; Zhang, Enlou; Yang, Xiangdong; Dakos, Vasilis; Scheffer, Marten","Wang, R; Dearing, JA; Langdon, PG; Zhang, EL; Yang, XD; Dakos, V; Scheffer, M",419.0,"[Wang, Rong; Dearing, John A.; Langdon, Peter G.] Univ Southampton, Palaeoecol Lab, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Wang, Rong; Zhang, Enlou; Yang, Xiangdong] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, State Key Lab Lake Sci & Environm, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Dakos, Vasilis; Scheffer, Marten] Wageningen Univ, Dept Aquat Ecol & Water Qual Management, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Dakos, Vasilis] CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Integrat Ecol Grp, E-41092 Seville, Spain",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11655,Article,,j.dearing@soton.ac.uk,422,UK Overseas Research Students Awards; Great Britain-China Educational Trust; University of Southampton; National Basic Research Program of China (973 program) [2012CB956104]; NWO-Rubicon; EU Marie Curie fellowship; Spinoza (NWO) Award; European Research Council,"A studentship to R.W. was funded through the UK Overseas Research Students Awards Scheme, the Great Britain-China Educational Trust and the University of Southampton.

151,439,496.0,"B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma comprises biologically and clinically distinct diseases the pathogenesis of which is associated with genetic lesions affecting oncogenes and tumour-suppressor genes. We report here that the two most common types-follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma-harbour frequent structural alterations inactivating CREBBP and, more rarely, EP300, two highly related histone and non-histone acetyltransferases (HATs) that act as transcriptional co-activators in multiple signalling pathways. Overall, about 39% of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and 41% of follicular lymphoma cases display genomic deletions and/or somatic mutations that remove or inactivate the HAT coding domain of these two genes. These lesions usually affect one allele, suggesting that reduction in HAT dosage is important for lymphomagenesis. We demonstrate specific defects in acetylation-mediated inactivation of the BCL6 oncoprotein and activation of the p53 tumour suppressor. These results identify CREBBP/EP300 mutations as a major pathogenetic mechanism shared by common forms of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, with direct implications for the use of drugs targeting acetylation/deacetylation mechanisms.","Pasqualucci, Laura; Dominguez-Sola, David; Chiarenza, Annalisa; Fabbri, Giulia; Grunn, Adina; Trifonov, Vladimir; Kasper, Lawryn H.; Lerach, Stephanie; Tang, Hongyan; Ma, Jing; Rossi, Davide; Chadburn, Amy; Murty, Vundavalli V.; Mullighan, Charles G.; Gaidano, Gianluca; Rabadan, Raul; Brindle, Paul K.; Dalla-Favera, Riccardo","Pasqualucci, L; Dominguez-Sola, D; Chiarenza, A; Fabbri, G; Grunn, A; Trifonov, V; Kasper, LH; Lerach, S; Tang, HY; Ma, J; Rossi, D; Chadburn, A; Murty, VV; Mullighan, CG; Gaidano, G; Rabadan, R; Brindle, PK; Dalla-Favera, R",189.0,"[Pasqualucci, Laura; Dominguez-Sola, David; Chiarenza, Annalisa; Fabbri, Giulia; Grunn, Adina; Tang, Hongyan; Murty, Vundavalli V.; Dalla-Favera, Riccardo] Columbia Univ, Inst Canc Genet, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Pasqualucci, Laura; Dominguez-Sola, David; Chiarenza, Annalisa; Fabbri, Giulia; Grunn, Adina; Tang, Hongyan; Murty, Vundavalli V.; Dalla-Favera, Riccardo] Columbia Univ, Herbert Irving Comprehens Canc Ctr, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Pasqualucci, Laura; Murty, Vundavalli V.; Dalla-Favera, Riccardo] Columbia Univ, Dept Pathol & Cell Biol, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Trifonov, Vladimir; Rabadan, Raul] Columbia Univ, Dept Biomed Informat, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Trifonov, Vladimir; Rabadan, Raul] Columbia Univ, Ctr Computat Biol & Bioinformat, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Kasper, Lawryn H.; Lerach, Stephanie; Brindle, Paul K.] St Jude Childrens Hosp, Dept Biochem, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Ma, Jing] St Jude Childrens Hosp, Hartwell Ctr Bioinformat & Biotechnol, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Rossi, Davide; Gaidano, Gianluca] Amedeo Avogadro Univ Eastern Piedmont, Div Hematol, Dept Clin & Expt Med, I-28100 Novara, Italy; [Rossi, Davide; Gaidano, Gianluca] Amedeo Avogadro Univ Eastern Piedmont, IRCAD, I-28100 Novara, Italy; [Chadburn, Amy] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Mullighan, Charles G.] St Jude Childrens Hosp, Dept Pathol, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Dalla-Favera, Riccardo] Columbia Univ, Dept Genet & Dev, New York, NY 10032 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09730,Article,,lp171@columbia.edu; rd10@columbia.edu,U75,"NIH [PO1-CA092625, RO1-CA37295, DE018183]; Leukemia and Lymphoma Society; Cancer Center (CORE) [P30 CA021765]; American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities of St Jude Children's Research Hospital; Northeast Biodefence Center [U54-AI057158]; National Library of Medicine [1R01LM010140-01]; AIRC [10007]","We thank Q.
