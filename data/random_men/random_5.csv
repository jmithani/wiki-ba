0,54,62.0,"The formation of relativistic jets by an accreting compact object is one of the fundamental mysteries of astrophysics. Although the theory is poorly understood, observations of relativistic jets from systems known as microquasars (compact binary stars)(1,2) have led to a well established phenomenology(3,4). Relativistic jets are not expected to be produced by sources with soft or supersoft X-ray spectra, although two such systems are known to produce relatively low-velocity bipolar outflows(5,6). Here we report the optical spectra of an ultraluminous supersoft X-ray source (ULS7,8) in the nearby galaxy M81 (M81 ULS-1; refs 9, 10). Unexpectedly, the spectra show blueshifted, broad H alpha emission lines, characteristic of baryonic jets with relativistic speeds. These time-variable emission lines have projected velocities of about 17 per cent of the speed of light, and seem to be similar to those from the prototype microquasar SS 433 (refs 11, 12). Such relativistic jets are not expected to be launched from white dwarfs(13), and an origin from a black hole or a neutron star is hard to reconcile with the persistence of M81 ULS-1's soft X-rays(10). Thus the unexpected presence of relativistic jets in a ULS challenges canonical theories of jet formation(3,4), but might be explained by a long-speculated, supercritically accreting black hole with optically thick outflows(14-20).","Liu, Ji-Feng; Bai, Yu; Wang, Song; Justham, Stephen; Lu, You-Jun; Gu, Wei-Min; Liu, Qing-Zhong; Di Stefano, Rosanne; Guo, Jin-Cheng; Cabrera-Lavers, Antonio; Alvarez, Pedro; Cao, Yi; Kulkarni, Shri","Liu, JF; Bai, Y; Wang, S; Justham, S; Lu, YJ; Gu, WM; Liu, QZ; Di Stefano, R; Guo, JC; Cabrera-Lavers, A; Alvarez, P; Cao, Y; Kulkarni, S",108.0,"[Liu, Ji-Feng; Bai, Yu; Wang, Song; Justham, Stephen; Lu, You-Jun; Guo, Jin-Cheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Natl Astron Observ, Key Lab Opt Astron, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China; [Liu, Ji-Feng; Justham, Stephen; Lu, You-Jun] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Astron & Space Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Gu, Wei-Min] Xiamen Univ, Dept Astron, Xiamen 361005, Fujian Province, Peoples R China; [Liu, Qing-Zhong] Chinese Acad Sci, Purple Mt Observ, Key Lab Dark Matter & Space Astron, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Di Stefano, Rosanne] Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Cabrera-Lavers, Antonio; Alvarez, Pedro] Inst Astrofis Canarias, E-38200 San Cristobal la Laguna, Tenerife, Spain; [Cabrera-Lavers, Antonio; Alvarez, Pedro] Univ La Laguna, Dept Astrofis, E-38205 San Cristobal la Laguna, Tenerife, Spain; [Cao, Yi; Kulkarni, Shri] CALTECH, Dept Astron, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15751,Article,1476-4687,jfliu@nao.cas.cn,+,Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB09000000]; 973 Program [2014CB845705]; National Science Foundation of China [NSFC-11333004/11425313]; W.M.

1,86,406.0,"Tropical forests are global epicentres of biodiversity and important modulators of climate change(1), and are mainly constrained by rainfall patterns(1-3). The severe short-term droughts that occurred recently in Amazonia have drawn attention to the vulnerability of tropical forests to climatic disturbances(4-9). The central African rainforests, the second-largest on Earth, have experienced a long-term drying trend(10,11) whose impacts on vegetation dynamics remain mostly unknown because in situ observations are very limited. The Congolese forest, with its drier conditions and higher percentage of semi-evergreen trees(12,13), may be more tolerant to short-term rainfall reduction than are wetter tropical forests(11), but for a long-term drought there may be critical thresholds of water availability below which higher-biomass, closed-canopy forests transition to more open, lower-biomass forests(1,2,14). Here we present observational evidence for a widespread decline in forest greenness over the past decade based on analyses of satellite data (optical, thermal, microwave and gravity) from several independent sensors over the Congo basin. This decline in vegetation greenness, particularly in the northern Congolese forest, is generally consistent with decreases in rainfall, terrestrial water storage, water content in aboveground woody and leaf biomass, and the canopy backscatter anomaly caused by changes in structure and moisture in upper forest layers. It is also consistent with increases in photosynthetically active radiation and land surface temperature. These multiple lines of evidence indicate that this large-scale vegetation browning, or loss of photosynthetic capacity, may be partially attributable to the long-term drying trend. Our results suggest that a continued gradual decline of photosynthetic capacity and moisture content driven by the persistent drying trend could alter the composition and structure of the Congolese forest to favour the spread of drought-tolerant species(1,2,14).","Zhou, Liming; Tian, Yuhong; Myneni, Ranga B.; Ciais, Philippe; Saatchi, Sassan; Liu, Yi Y.; Piao, Shilong; Chen, Haishan; Vermote, Eric F.; Song, Conghe; Hwang, Taehee","Zhou, LM; Tian, YH; Myneni, RB; Ciais, P; Saatchi, S; Liu, YY; Piao, SL; Chen, HS; Vermote, EF; Song, CH; Hwang, TH",86.0,"[Zhou, Liming] SUNY Albany, Dept Atmospher & Environm Sci, Albany, NY 12222 USA; [Tian, Yuhong] NOAA, IMSG, NESDIS, Ctr Satellite Applicat & Res,STAR, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Myneni, Ranga B.] Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Ciais, Philippe] UVSQ, CEA, CNRS, LSCE, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Saatchi, Sassan] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA; [Liu, Yi Y.] Univ New S Wales, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Syst Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Liu, Yi Y.] Univ New S Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Piao, Shilong] Peking Univ, Dept Ecol, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Chen, Haishan] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Minist Educ, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Vermote, Eric F.] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Song, Conghe] Univ N Carolina, Dept Geog, Chapel Hill, NC 29599 USA; [Song, Conghe] Anhui Agr Univ, Sch Forestry & Landscape Architecture, Hefei 230036, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Hwang, Taehee] Univ N Carolina, Inst Environm, Chapel Hill, NC 29599 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13265,Article,1476-4687,lzhou@albany.edu,+,"NOAA NESDIS [NA11NES4400010]; University at Albany, State University of New York; NASA's Earth Science Division; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41230422]","This study was supported by the NOAA NESDIS project (NA11NES4400010) and by the startup funds provided by the University at Albany, State University of New York.

2,30,392.0,"DNA sequence information underpins genetic research, enabling discoveries of important biological or medical benefit. Sequencing projects have traditionally used long ( 400 - 800 base pair) reads, but the existence of reference sequences for the human and many other genomes makes it possible to develop new, fast approaches to re- sequencing, whereby shorter reads are compared to a reference to identify intraspecies genetic variation. Here we report an approach that generates several billion bases of accurate nucleotide sequence per experiment at low cost. Single molecules of DNA are attached to a flat surface, amplified in situ and used as templates for synthetic sequencing with fluorescent reversible terminator deoxyribonucleotides. Images of the surface are analysed to generate high- quality sequence. We demonstrate application of this approach to human genome sequencing on flow- sorted X chromosomes and then scale the approach to determine the genome sequence of a male Yoruba from Ibadan, Nigeria. We build an accurate consensus sequence from. 303 average depth of paired 35- base reads. We characterize four million single- nucleotide polymorphisms and four hundred thousand structural variants, many of which were previously unknown. Our approach is effective for accurate, rapid and economical whole- genome re- sequencing and many other biomedical applications.","Bentley, David R.; Balasubramanian, Shankar; Swerdlow, Harold P.; Smith, Geoffrey P.; Milton, John; Brown, Clive G.; Hall, Kevin P.; Evers, Dirk J.; Barnes, Colin L.; Bignell, Helen R.; Boutell, Jonathan M.; Bryant, Jason; Carter, Richard J.; Cheetham, R.

3,17,389.0,"Zonal jets are very common in nature. Well-known examples are those in the atmospheres of giant planets and the alternating jet streams found in the Earth's world ocean(1). Zonal flow formation in nuclear fusion devices is also well studied(2). A common feature of these zonal flows is that they are spontaneously generated in turbulent systems. Because the Earth's outer core is believed to be in a turbulent state, it is possible that there is zonal flow in the liquid iron of the outer core. Here we report an investigation at the current low-viscosity limit of numerical simulations of the geodynamo. We find a previously unknown convection regime of the outer core that has a dual structure comprising inner, sheet-like radial plumes and an outer, westward cylindrical zonal flow. We numerically confirm that the dual-convection structure with such a zonal flow is stable under a strong, self-generated dipole magnetic field.","Miyagoshi, Takehiro; Kageyama, Akira; Sato, Tetsuya","Miyagoshi, T; Kageyama, A; Sato, T",793.0,"[Kageyama, Akira] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan; [Miyagoshi, Takehiro] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan; [Sato, Tetsuya] Univ Hyogo, Kobe, Hyogo 6500044, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08754,Article,,kage@cs.kobe-u.ac.jp,U102,KAKENHI [17540404]; Mitsubishi Foundation,This work was supported by KAKENHI (17540404) and The Mitsubishi Foundation.,553VG,,,ROTATING SPHERICAL-SHELL; GEODYNAMO SIMULATIONS; DEEP CONVECTION; RAYLEIGH NUMBER; DRIVEN; EQUATIONS; PLANETS; DYNAMOS; FIELD; MODEL,7282.0,NATURE,Nature,English,26.0,No,"Kageyama, Akira/0000-0003-0433-668X","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",11-Feb,5.0,LONDON,20148036.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2010.0,"Kageyama, Akira/H-4537-2013","Kageyama, A (reprint author), Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,36.0,Zonal flow formation in the Earth's core,0.0,19.0,WOS:000274394300036,389.0,463,Multidisciplinary Sciences,36,tetsuya,sato,456.0,16,male,1.0,bpM4ZKkAAAAJ,1,"[0, 1474]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
4,49,22.0,"The contribution of co-translational chaperone functions to protein folding is poorly understood. Ribosome-associated trigger factor (TF) is the first molecular chaperone encountered by nascent polypeptides in bacteria. Here we show, using fluorescence spectroscopy to monitor TF function and structural rearrangements in real time, that TF interacts with ribosomes and translating polypeptides in a dynamic reaction cycle. Ribosome binding stabilizes TF in an open, activated conformation. Activated TF departs from the ribosome after a mean residence time of similar to 10 s, but may remain associated with the elongating nascent chain for up to 35 s, allowing entry of a new TF molecule at the ribosome docking site. The duration of nascent-chain interaction correlates with the occurrence of hydrophobic motifs in translating polypeptides, reflecting a high aggregation propensity. These findings can explain how TF prevents misfolding events during translation and may provide a paradigm for the regulation of nucleotide-independent chaperones.","Kaiser, Christian M.; Chang, Hung-Chun; Agashe, Vishwas R.; Lakshmipathy, Sathish K.; Etchells, Stephanie A.; Hayer-Hartl, Manajit; Hartl, F.

5,51,370.0,"The genetic divergence time between two species varies substantially across the genome, conveying important information about the timing and process of speciation. Here we develop a framework for studying this variation and apply it to about 20 million base pairs of aligned sequence from humans, chimpanzees, gorillas and more distantly related primates. Human-chimpanzee genetic divergence varies from less than 84% to more than 147% of the average, a range of more than 4 million years. Our analysis also shows that human-chimpanzee speciation occurred less than 6.3 million years ago and probably more recently, conflicting with some interpretations of ancient fossils. Most strikingly, chromosome X shows an extremely young genetic divergence time, close to the genome minimum along nearly its entire length. These unexpected features would be explained if the human and chimpanzee lineages initially diverged, then later exchanged genes before separating permanently.","Patterson, Nick; Richter, Daniel J.; Gnerre, Sante; Lander, Eric S.; Reich, David","Patterson, N; Richter, DJ; Gnerre, S; Lander, ES; Reich, D",1103.0,"Harvard Univ, Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; MIT, Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature04789,Article,1476-4687,reich@genetics.med.harvard.edu,1108,,,057SM,,,ANCESTRAL POPULATION SIZES; DNA-SEQUENCES; DIVERGENCE TIMES; UPPER MIOCENE; DROSOPHILA-MAURITIANA; MAMMALIAN EVOLUTION; GENOME SEQUENCE; HOMINID; CHAD; PALEONTOLOGY,7097.0,NATURE,Nature,English,43.0,No,"Richter, Daniel/0000-0002-9238-5571","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",28-Jun,6.0,LONDON,16710306.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,,"Reich, D (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,319.0,Genetic evidence for complex speciation of humans and chimpanzees,4.0,100.0,WOS:000238615500040,370.0,441,Multidisciplinary Sciences,326,david,reich,14.0,12593,male,1.0,rK-2mFQAAAAJ,1,"[0, 1474]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
6,108,237.0,"Lung squamous cell carcinoma is a common type of lung cancer, causing approximately 400,000 deaths per year worldwide. Genomic alterations in squamous cell lung cancers have not been comprehensively characterized, and no molecularly targeted agents have been specifically developed for its treatment. As part of The Cancer Genome Atlas, here we profile 178 lung squamous cell carcinomas to provide a comprehensive landscape of genomic and epigenomic alterations. We show that the tumour type is characterized by complex genomic alterations, with a mean of 360 exonic mutations, 165 genomic rearrangements, and 323 segments of copy number alteration per tumour. We find statistically recurrent mutations in 11 genes, including mutation of TP53 in nearly all specimens. Previously unreported loss-of-function mutations are seen in the HLA-A class I major histocompatibility gene. Significantly altered pathways included NFE2L2 and KEAP1 in 34%, squamous differentiation genes in 44%, phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase pathway genes in 47%, and CDKN2A and RB1 in 72% of tumours. We identified a potential therapeutic target in most tumours, offering new avenues of investigation for the treatment of squamous cell lung cancers.","Hammerman, Peter S.; Lawrence, Michael S.; Voet, Douglas; Jing, Rui; Cibulskis, Kristian; Sivachenko, Andrey; Stojanov, Petar; McKenna, Aaron; Lander, Eric S.; Gabriel, Stacey; Getz, Gad; Sougnez, Carrie; Imielinski, Marcin; Helman, Elena; Hernandez, Bryan; Pho, Nam H.; Meyerson, Matthew; Chu, Andy; Chun, Hye-Jung E.; Mungall, Andrew J.; Pleasance, Erin; Robertson, A.

7,79,242.0,"Genome instability is central to ageing, cancer and other diseases. It is not only proteins involved in DNA replication or the DNA damage response (DDR) that are important for maintaining genome integrity: from yeast to higher eukaryotes, mutations in genes involved in pre-mRNA splicing and in the biogenesis and export of messenger ribonudeoprotein (mRNP) also induce DNA damage and genome instability. This instability is frequently mediated by R-loops formed by DNA-RNA hybrids and a displaced single-stranded DNA(1). Here we show that the human TREX-2 complex, which is involved in mRNP biogenesis and export, prevents genome instability as determined by the accumulation of gamma-H2AX (Ser-139 phosphorylated histone H2AX) and 53BP1 foci and single-cell electrophoresis in cells depleted of the TREX-2 subunits PCID2, GANP and DSSI. We show that the BRCA2 repair factor, which binds to DSS1, also associates with PCID2 in the cell. The use of an enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged hybrid-binding domain of RNase HI and the S9.6 antibody did not detect R-loops in TREX-2-depleted cells, but did detect the accumulation of R-loops in BRCA2-depleted cells. The results indicate that R-loops are frequently formed in cells and that BRCA2 is required for their processing. This link between BRCA2 and RNA-mediated genome instability indicates that R-loops may be a chief source of replication stress and cancer-associated instability.","Bhatia, Vaibhav; Barroso, Sonia I.; Garcia-Rubio, Maria L.; Tumini, Emanuela; Herrera-Moyano, Emilia; Aguilera, Andres","Bhatia, V; Barroso, SI; Garcia-Rubio, ML; Tumini, E; Herrera-Moyano, E; Aguilera, A",362.0,"[Bhatia, Vaibhav; Barroso, Sonia I.; Garcia-Rubio, Maria L.; Tumini, Emanuela; Herrera-Moyano, Emilia; Aguilera, Andres] Univ Seville, Ctr Andaluz Biol Mol & Med Regenerat CABIMER, Seville 41092, Spain",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13374,Article,1476-4687,aguilo@us.es,+,"Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [C5D2007-00015, BFU2010-16372]; Junta de Andalucia [CVI4567]; European Union (FEDER)","We thank J.C.

8,133,301.0,"The causes and timing of tropical glacier fluctuations during the Holocene epoch (10,000 years ago to present) are poorly understood. Yet constraining their sensitivity to changes in climate(1) is important, as these glaciers are both sensitive indicators of climate change and serve as water reservoirs for highland regions(2). Studies have so far documented extra-tropical glacier fluctuations(3,4), but in the tropics, glacier-climate relationships are insufficiently understood. Here we present a (10)Be chronology for the past 11,000 years (11 kyr), using 57 moraines from the Bolivian Telata glacier (in the Cordillera Real mountain range). This chronology indicates that Telata glacier retreated irregularly. Arapid and strong melting from the maximum extent occurred from 10.8 +/- 0.9 to 8.5 +/- 0.4 kyr ago, followed by a slower retreat until the Little Ice Age, about 200 years ago. A dramatic increase in the rate of retreat occurred over the twentieth century. A glacier-climate model indicates that, relative to modern climate, annual mean temperature for the Telata glacier region was -3.3 +/- 0.8 degrees C cooler at 11 kyr ago and remained -2.1 +/- 0.8 degrees C cooler until the end of the Little Ice Age. We suggest that long-term warming of the eastern tropical Pacific and increased atmospheric temperature in response to enhanced austral summer insolation were the main drivers for the long-term Holocene retreat of glaciers in the southern tropics.","Jomelli, Vincent; Khodri, Myriam; Favier, Vincent; Brunstein, Daniel; Ledru, Marie-Pierre; Wagnon, Patrick; Blard, Pierre-Henri; Sicart, Jean-Emmanuel; Braucher, Regis; Grancher, Delphine; Bourles, Didier Louis; Braconnot, Pascale; Vuille, Mathias","Jomelli, V; Khodri, M; Favier, V; Brunstein, D; Ledru, MP; Wagnon, P; Blard, PH; Sicart, JE; Braucher, R; Grancher, D; Bourles, DL; Braconnot, P; Vuille, M",196.0,"[Jomelli, Vincent; Brunstein, Daniel; Grancher, Delphine] Univ Paris 01, CNRS, Lab Geog Phys, F-92195 Meudon, France; [Khodri, Myriam] IRD, IPSL, LOCEAN, F-75252 Paris 05, France; [Favier, Vincent] UJF, CNRS, LGGE, F-38402 St Martin Dheres, France; [Ledru, Marie-Pierre] UM2 CNRS IRD, ISEM, IRD UMR 226, F-34095 Montpellier, France; [Wagnon, Patrick; Sicart, Jean-Emmanuel] UJF Grenoble 1, CNRS, UMR 5183, IRD,G INP,LGGE,LTHE,UMR 5564, F-38402 Grenoble, France; [Blard, Pierre-Henri] Univ Lorraine, CNRS, UPR2300, CRPG, F-54501 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France; [Braucher, Regis; Bourles, Didier Louis] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, UMR 6635, CEREGE, F-13545 Aix En Provence, France; [Braconnot, Pascale] CEA Saclay, UVSQ, CNRS, CEA,Unite Mixte,Lab Sci Climat & Environm,IPSL, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Vuille, Mathias] SUNY Albany, Dept Atmospher & Environm Sci, Albany, NY 12222 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10150,Article,,jomelli@cnrs-bellevue.fr,199,"French INSU; French ANR [06-Vuln-010, 10-Blan-608-01]; INSU/CNRS; French Ministry of Research and Higher Education; IRD and CEA; CNRS; EU [EVK2-CT-2002-00153]; Programme National d'Etude de la Dynamique du Climate (PNEDC)","Financial support was provided by the French INSU programme 'LEVE', the French ANR Escarcel programme no. 06-Vuln-010, UR Great Ice at IRD, and the French ANR El Paso programme no. 10-Blan-608-01.

9,58,163.0,"Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a frequent disease in which the genetic alterations determining the clinicobiological behaviour are not fully understood. Here we describe a comprehensive evaluation of the genomic landscape of 452 CLL cases and 54 patients with monoclonal B-lymphocytosis, a precursor disorder. We extend the number of CLL driver alterations, including changes in ZNF292, ZMYM3, ARID1A and PTPN11. We also identify novel recurrent mutations in non-coding regions, including the 39 region of NOTCH1, which cause aberrant splicing events, increase NOTCH1 activity and result in a more aggressive disease.

10,119,34.0,"Opium is one of the world's oldest drugs, and its derivatives morphine and codeine are among the most used clinical drugs to relieve severe pain. These prototypical opioids produce analgesia as well as many undesirable side effects (sedation, apnoea and dependence) by binding to and activating the G-protein-coupled mu-opioid receptor (mu-OR) in the central nervous system. Here we describe the 2.8 angstrom crystal structure of the mouse mu-OR in complex with an irreversible morphinan antagonist. Compared to the buried binding pocket observed in most G-protein-coupled receptors published so far, the morphinan ligand binds deeply within a large solvent-exposed pocket. Of particular interest, the mu-OR crystallizes as a two-fold symmetrical dimer through a four-helix bundle motif formed by transmembrane segments 5 and 6. These high-resolution insights into opioid receptor structure will enable the application of structure-based approaches to develop better drugs for the management of pain and addiction.","Manglik, Aashish; Kruse, Andrew C.; Kobilka, Tong Sun; Thian, Foon Sun; Mathiesen, Jesper M.; Sunahara, Roger K.; Pardo, Leonardo; Weis, William I.; Kobilka, Brian K.; Granier, Sebastien","Manglik, A; Kruse, AC; Kobilka, TS; Thian, FS; Mathiesen, JM; Sunahara, RK; Pardo, L; Weis, WI; Kobilka, BK; Granier, S",321.0,"[Manglik, Aashish; Kruse, Andrew C.; Kobilka, Tong Sun; Thian, Foon Sun; Mathiesen, Jesper M.; Weis, William I.; Kobilka, Brian K.; Granier, Sebastien] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Physiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Sunahara, Roger K.] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Pardo, Leonardo] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Unit Bioestat, Lab Med Computac, Barcelona 08193, Spain; [Weis, William I.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Struct, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Granier, Sebastien] CNRS, INSERM, U661, UMR 5203, F-34094 Montpellier, France; [Granier, Sebastien] Univ Montpellier 1 & 2, Inst Genom Fonctionnelle, F-34094 Montpellier, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10954,Article,,kobilka@stanford.edu; granier@stanford.edu,U170,"INSERM; Stanford Medical Scientist Training Program; National Science Foundation; Lundbeck Foundation; National Institutes of Health [NS028471, DA031418]; Mathers Foundation","We acknowledge support from INSERM (S.

11,63,324.0,"mu-Opioid receptors (mu ORs) are G-protein-coupled receptors that are activated by a structurally diverse spectrum of natural and synthetic agonists including endogenous endorphin peptides, morphine and methadone. The recent structures of the mu OR in inactive(1) and agonist-induced active states (Huang et al., ref. 2) provide snapshots of the receptor at the beginning and end of a signalling event, but little is known about the dynamic sequence of events that span these two states. Here we use solution-state NMR to examine the process of mu OR activation using a purified receptor (mouse sequence) preparation in an amphiphile membrane-like environment. We obtain spectra of the mu OR in the absence of ligand, and in the presence of the high-affinity agonist BU72 alone, or with BU72 and a G protein mimetic nanobody. Our results show that conformational changes in transmembrane segments 5 and 6 (TM5 and TM6), which are required for the full engagement of a G protein, are almost completely dependent on the presence of both the agonist and the G protein mimetic nanobody, revealing a weak allosteric coupling between the agonist-binding pocket and the G-protein-coupling interface (TM5 and TM6), similar to that observed for the beta 2-adrenergic receptor(3). Unexpectedly, in the presence of agonist alone, we find larger spectral changes involving intracellular loop 1 and helix 8 compared to changes in TM5 and TM6. These results suggest that one or both of these domains may play a role in the initial interaction with the G protein, and that TM5 and TM6 are only engaged later in the process of complex formation. The initial interactions between the G protein and intracellular loop 1 and/or helix 8 may be involved in G-protein coupling specificity, as has been suggested for other family A G-protein-coupled receptors.","Sounier, Remy; Mas, Camille; Steyaert, Jan; Laeremans, Toon; Manglik, Aashish; Huang, Weijiao; Kobilka, Brian K.; Demene, Helene; Granier, Sebastien","Sounier, R; Mas, C; Steyaert, J; Laeremans, T; Manglik, A; Huang, WJ; Kobilka, BK; Demene, H; Granier, S",375.0,"[Sounier, Remy; Mas, Camille; Granier, Sebastien] Univ Montpellier, Inst Genom Fonct, CNRS, INSERM,U1191,UMR 5203, F-34000 Montpellier, France; [Steyaert, Jan; Laeremans, Toon] Vrije Univ Brussel, Struct Biol Brussels, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Steyaert, Jan; Laeremans, Toon] VIB, Struct Biol Res Ctr, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Manglik, Aashish; Huang, Weijiao; Kobilka, Brian K.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Physiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Demene, Helene] Univ Montpellier, Ctr Biochim Struct, CNRS, INSERM 1054,UMR 5048, F-34090 Montpellier, France",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14680,Article,1476-4687,helene@cbs.cnrs.fr; sebastien.granier@igf.cnrs.fr,+,INSERM; CNRS; National Institutes of Health [NIDA-DA036246],We acknowledge support from INSERM (S.G.) and CNRS (H.D.) and from the National Institutes of Health Grant (NIDA-DA036246 to B.K.K. and S.G.).

12,117,478.0,"Titan has clouds, rain and lakes-like Earth-but composed of methane rather than water. Unlike Earth, most of the condensable methane (the equivalent of 5 m depth globally averaged(1)) lies in the atmosphere. Liquid detected on the surface (about 2 m deep) has been found by radar images only poleward of 50 degrees latitude(2,3), while dune fields pervade the tropics(4). General circulation models explain this dichotomy, predicting that methane efficiently migrates to the poles from these lower latitudes(5-7). Here we report an analysis of near-infrared spectral images(8) of the region between 20 degrees N and 20 degrees S latitude. The data reveal that the lowest fluxes in seven wavelength bands that probe Titan's surface occur in an oval region of about 60 x 40 km(2), which has been observed repeatedly since 2004. Radiative transfer analyses demonstrate that the resulting spectrum is consistent with a black surface, indicative of liquid methane on the surface. Enduring low-latitude lakes are best explained as supplied by subterranean sources (within the last 10,000 years), which may be responsible for Titan's methane, the continual photochemical depletion of which furnishes Titan's organic chemistry(9).","Griffith, Caitlin A.; Lora, Juan M.; Turner, Jake; Penteado, Paulo F.; Brown, Robert H.; Tomasko, Martin G.; Doose, Lyn; See, Charles","Griffith, CA; Lora, JM; Turner, J; Penteado, PF; Brown, RH; Tomasko, MG; Doose, L; See, C",237.0,"[Griffith, Caitlin A.; Lora, Juan M.; Turner, Jake; Brown, Robert H.; Tomasko, Martin G.; Doose, Lyn; See, Charles] Univ Arizona, Lunar & Planetary Lab, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Penteado, Paulo F.] Univ Sao Paulo, IAG, BR-05508090 Sao Paulo, Brazil",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11165,Article,,griffith@lpl.arizona.edu,239,NASA,"Research by C.

13,5,65.0,"Eukaryotic cells express a wide variety of endogenous small regulatory RNAs that regulate heterochromatin formation, developmental timing, defence against parasitic nucleic acids and genome rearrangement. Many small regulatory RNAs are thought to function in nuclei(1,2). For instance, in plants and fungi, short interfering RNA (siRNAs) associate with nascent transcripts and direct chromatin and/or DNA modifications(1,2). To understand further the biological roles of small regulatory RNAs, we conducted a genetic screen to identify factors required for RNA interference (RNAi) in Caenorhabditis elegans nuclei(3). Here we show that the gene nuclear RNAi defective-2 (nrde-2) encodes an evolutionarily conserved protein that is required for siRNA-mediated silencing in nuclei. NRDE-2 associates with the Argonaute protein NRDE-3 within nuclei and is recruited by NRDE-3/siRNA complexes to nascent transcripts that have been targeted by RNAi. We find that nuclear-localized siRNAs direct an NRDE-2-dependent silencing of pre-messenger RNAs (pre-mRNAs) 3' to sites of RNAi, an NRDE-2-dependent accumulation of RNA polymerase (RNAP) II at genomic loci targeted by RNAi, and NRDE-2-dependent decreases in RNAP II occupancy and RNAP II transcriptional activity 39 to sites of RNAi. These results define NRDE-2 as a component of the nuclear RNAi machinery and demonstrate that metazoan siRNAs can silence nuclear-localized RNAs co-transcriptionally. In addition, these results establish a novel mode of RNAP II regulation: siRNA-directed recruitment of NRDE factors that inhibit RNAP II during the elongation phase of transcription.","Guang, Shouhong; Bochner, Aaron F.; Burkhart, Kirk B.; Burton, Nick; Pavelec, Derek M.; Kennedy, Scott","Guang, SH; Bochner, AF; Burkhart, KB; Burton, N; Pavelec, DM; Kennedy, S",1097.0,"[Guang, Shouhong; Bochner, Aaron F.; Burkhart, Kirk B.; Burton, Nick; Kennedy, Scott] Univ Wisconsin, Genet Lab, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Pavelec, Derek M.; Kennedy, Scott] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Pharmacol, Madison, WI 53706 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09095,Article,,sgkennedy@wisc.edu,U165,Pew and Shaw scholars programmes; National Institutes of Health; American Heart Association,"We thank P.

14,74,94.0,"Stresses acting on cold, thick and negatively buoyant oceanic lithosphere are thought to be crucial to the initiation of subduction and the operation of plate tectonics(1,2), which characterizes the present-day geodynamics of the Earth. Because the Earth's interior was hotter in the Archaean eon, the oceanic crust may have been thicker, thereby making the oceanic lithosphere more buoyant than at present(3), and whether subduction and plate tectonics occurred during this time is ambiguous, both in the geological record and in geodynamic models(4). Here we show that because the oceanic crust was thick and buoyant(5), early continents may have produced intra-lithospheric gravitational stresses large enough to drive their gravitational spreading, to initiate subduction at their margins and to trigger episodes of subduction. Our model predicts the co-occurrence of deep to progressively shallower mafic volcanics and arc magmatism within continents in a self-consistent geodynamic framework, explaining the enigmatic multimodal volcanism and tectonic record of Archaean cratons(6). Moreover, our model predicts a petrological stratification and tectonic structure of the sub-continental lithospheric mantle, two predictions that are consistent with xenolith(5) and seismic studies, respectively, and consistent with the existence of amid-lithospheric seismic discontinuity(7). The slow gravitational collapse of early continents could have kick-started transient episodes of plate tectonics until, as the Earth's interior cooled and oceanic lithosphere became heavier, plate tectonics became self-sustaining.","Rey, Patrice F.; Coltice, Nicolas; Flament, Nicolas","Rey, PF; Coltice, N; Flament, N",405.0,"[Rey, Patrice F.; Flament, Nicolas] Univ Sydney, Earthbyte Res Grp, Sch Geosci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Coltice, Nicolas] Univ Lyon 1, Ecole Normale Super Lyon, UMR CNRS 5276, Lab Geol Lyon, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France; [Coltice, Nicolas] Inst Univ France, F-75005 Paris, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13728,Article,1476-4687,patrice.rey@sydney.edu.au,+,Australian Government; Institut Universitaire de France; European Research Council (ERC) [617588]; Statoil ASA,"We thank W.

15,50,39.0,"The most efficient energy sources known in the Universe are accretion disks. Those around black holes convert 5 - 40 per cent of restmass energy to radiation. Like water circling a drain, inflowing mass must lose angular momentum, presumably by vigorous turbulence in disks, which are essentially inviscid(1). The origin of the turbulence is unclear. Hot disks of electrically conducting plasma can become turbulent by way of the linear magnetorotational instability(2). Cool disks, such as the planet- forming disks of protostars, may be too poorly ionized for the magnetorotational instability to occur, and therefore essentially unmagnetized and linearly stable. Nonlinear hydrodynamic instability often occurs in linearly stable flows ( for example, pipe flows) at sufficiently large Reynolds numbers. Although planet- forming disks have extreme Reynolds numbers, keplerian rotation enhances their linear hydrodynamic stability, so the question of whether they can be turbulent and thereby transport angular momentum effectively is controversial(3-15). Here we report a laboratory experiment, demonstrating that non- magnetic quasi- keplerian flows at Reynolds numbers up to millions are essentially steady. Scaled to accretion disks, rates of angular momentum transport lie far below astrophysical requirements. By ruling out purely hydrodynamic turbulence, our results indirectly support the magnetorotational instability as the likely cause of turbulence, even in cool disks.","Ji, Hantao; Burin, Michael; Schartman, Ethan; Goodman, Jeremy","Ji, HT; Burin, M; Schartman, E; Goodman, J",343.0,"Princeton Univ, Ctr Magnet Self Org Lab & Astrophys Plasmas, Plasma Phys Lab, Princeton, NJ 08543 USA; Princeton Univ, Dept Astrophys Sci, Princeton, NJ 08543 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature05323,Article,,hji@pppl.gov,346,,,105GL,,,ROTATING CYLINDERS; ACCRETION DISKS; NONLINEAR STABILITY; SHEAR TURBULENCE; STRATIFIED DISKS; REYNOLDS-NUMBER; INSTABILITY; FLOW; CIRCULATION; EVOLUTION,7117.0,NATURE,Nature,English,32.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",16-Nov,4.0,LONDON,17108959.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,,"Ji, HT (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Ctr Magnet Self Org Lab & Astrophys Plasmas, Plasma Phys Lab, Princeton, NJ 08543 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,139.0,Hydrodynamic turbulence cannot transport angular momentum effectively in astrophysical disks,0.0,16.0,WOS:000242018300042,39.0,444,Multidisciplinary Sciences,139,jeremy,goodman,98.0,1840,male,0.99,OUIu4uoAAAAJ,1,"[0, 1474]",42790519,1,17914517,1,Chloe Goodman,Chloe Goodman,1,1
16,92,356.0,"Temporal changes in the Earth's magnetic field, known as geomagnetic secular variation, occur most prominently at low latitudes in the Atlantic hemisphere(1,2) (that is, from 290 degrees east to 90 degrees east), whereas in the Pacific hemisphere there is comparatively little activity. This is a consequence of the geographical localization of intense, westward drifting, equatorial magnetic flux patches at the core surface(3). Despite successes in explaining the morphology of the geomagnetic field(4), numerical models of the geodynamo have so far failed to account systematically for this striking pattern of geomagnetic secular variation. Here we show that it can be reproduced provided that two mechanisms relying on the inner core are jointly considered. First, gravitational coupling(5) aligns the inner core with the mantle, forcing the flow of liquid metal in the outer core into a giant, westward drifting, sheet-like gyre(6). The resulting shear concentrates azimuthal magnetic flux at low latitudes close to the core-mantle boundary, where it is expelled by core convection and subsequently transported westward. Second, differential inner-core growth(7,8), fastest below Indonesia(6,9), causes an asymmetric buoyancy release in the outer core which in turn distorts the gyre, forcing it to become eccentric, in agreement with recent core flow inversions(6,10,11). This bottom-up heterogeneous driving of core convection dominates top-down driving from mantle thermal heterogeneities, and localizes magnetic variations in a longitudinal sector centred beneath the Atlantic, where the eccentric gyre reaches the core surface. To match the observed pattern of geomagnetic secular variation, the solid material forming the inner core must now be in a state of differential growth rather than one of growth and melting induced by convective translation(7,8).","Aubert, Julien; Finlay, Christopher C.; Fournier, Alexandre","Aubert, J; Finlay, CC; Fournier, A",219.0,"[Aubert, Julien; Fournier, Alexandre] Univ Paris Diderot, Inst Phys Globe Paris, Sorbonne Paris Cite, UMR 7154,CNRS, F-75005 Paris, France; [Finlay, Christopher C.] Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Space Inst, Div Geomagnetism, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12574,Article,1476-4687,aubert@ipgp.fr,+,"French Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-2011-BS56-011]; GENCI-IDRIS [2012-042122, 2013-042122]","This work was supported by the French Agence Nationale de la Recherche (grant ANR-2011-BS56-011).

17,110,279.0,"Transcription factors bind in a combinatorial fashion to specify the on-and-off states of genes; the ensemble of these binding events forms a regulatory network, constituting the wiring diagram for a cell. To examine the principles of the human transcriptional regulatory network, we determined the genomic binding information of 119 transcription-related factors in over 450 distinct experiments. We found the combinatorial, co-association of transcription factors to be highly context specific: distinct combinations of factors bind at specific genomic locations. In particular, there are significant differences in the binding proximal and distal to genes. We organized all the transcription factor binding into a hierarchy and integrated it with other genomic information (for example, microRNA regulation), forming a dense meta-network. Factors at different levels have different properties; for instance, top-level transcription factors more strongly influence expression and middle-level ones co-regulate targets to mitigate information-flow bottlenecks. Moreover, these co-regulations give rise to many enriched network motifs (for example, noise-buffering feed-forward loops). Finally, more connected network components are under stronger selection and exhibit a greater degree of allele-specific activity (that is, differential binding to the two parental alleles). The regulatory information obtained in this study will be crucial for interpreting personal genome sequences and understanding basic principles of human biology and disease.","Gerstein, Mark B.; Kundaje, Anshul; Hariharan, Manoj; Landt, Stephen G.; Yan, Koon-Kiu; Cheng, Chao; Mu, Xinmeng Jasmine; Khurana, Ekta; Rozowsky, Joel; Alexander, Roger; Min, Renqiang; Alves, Pedro; Abyzov, Alexej; Addleman, Nick; Bhardwaj, Nitin; Boyle, Alan P.; Cayting, Philip; Charos, Alexandra; Chen, David Z.; Cheng, Yong; Clarke, Declan; Eastman, Catharine; Euskirchen, Ghia; Frietze, Seth; Fu, Yao; Gertz, Jason; Grubert, Fabian; Harmanci, Arif; Jain, Preti; Kasowski, Maya; Lacroute, Phil; Leng, Jing; Lian, Jin; Monahan, Hannah; O'Geen, Henriette; Ouyang, Zhengqing; Partridge, E.

18,56,107.0,"Classical sexual selection theory(1-4) provides a well-supported conceptual framework for understanding the evolution and signalling function of male ornaments. It predicts that males obtain greater fitness benefits than females through multiple mating because sperm are cheaper to produce than eggs. Sexual selection should therefore lead to the evolution of male-biased secondary sexual characters. However, females of many species are also highly ornamented(5-7). The view that this is due to a correlated genetic response to selection on males(1,8) was widely accepted as an explanation for female ornamentation for over 100 years(5) and current theoretical(9,10) and empirical(11-13) evidence suggests that genetic constraints can limit sex-specific trait evolution. Alternatively, female ornamentation can be the outcome of direct selection for signalling needs(7,14). Since few studies have explored interspecific patterns of both male and female elaboration, our understanding of the evolution of animal ornamentation remains incomplete, especially over broad taxonomic scales. Here we use a new method to quantify plumage colour of all similar to 6,000 species of passerine birds to determine the main evolutionary drivers of ornamental colouration in both sexes. We found that conspecific male and female colour elaboration are strongly correlated, suggesting that evolutionary changes in one sex are constrained by changes in the other sex. Both sexes are more ornamented in larger species and in species living in tropical environments. Ornamentation in females (but not males) is increased in cooperative breeders-species in which female-female competition for reproductive opportunities and other resources related to breeding may be high(6). Finally, strong sexual selection on males has antagonistic effects, causing an increase in male colouration but a considerably more pronounced reduction in female ornamentation. Our results indicate that although there may be genetic constraints to sexually independent colour evolution, both female and male ornamentation are strongly and often differentially related to morphological, social and life-history variables.","Dale, James; Dey, Cody J.; Delhey, Kaspar; Kempenaers, Bart; Valcu, Mihai","Dale, J; Dey, CJ; Delhey, K; Kempenaers, B; Valcu, M",367.0,"[Dale, James] Massey Univ, Inst Nat & Math Sci, Auckland 0745, New Zealand; [Dey, Cody J.] McMaster Univ, Dept Biol, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada; [Delhey, Kaspar] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Delhey, Kaspar] Max Planck Inst Ornithol, D-78315 Radolfzell am Bodensee, Germany; [Kempenaers, Bart; Valcu, Mihai] Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Dept Behav Ecol & Evolutionary Genet, D-82319 Seewiesen, Germany",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15509,Article,1476-4687,j.dale@massey.ac.nz,+,Massey University; Australian and Pacific Science Foundation [APSF 10/8]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Canadian Graduate Scholarship; Australian Research Council [DE120102323]; Max Planck Society,"We thank the many ornithologists and scientists who have published their data or contributed data to public databases, allowing us to conduct this study.

Here we provide a structural explanation for the pathological properties of the complex formed between streptococcal M1 and human fibrinogen. A conformationally dynamic coiled-coil dimer of M1 was found to organize four fibrinogen molecules into a specific cross-like pattern. This pattern supported the construction of a supramolecular network that was required for neutrophil activation but was distinct from a fibrin clot. Disruption of this network into other supramolecular assemblies was not tolerated.

The results indicate a sister-group relationship between Tardigrada and Euarthropoda, adding palaeontological support to the neurological(16,17) and musculoskeletal(18,19) evidence uniting these disparate clades.

21,21,187.0,"Despite decades of research, the identity of the cells generating the first haematopoietic cells in mammalian embryos is unknown(1). Indeed, whether blood cells arise from mesodermal cells, mesenchymal progenitors, bipotent endothelial - haematopoietic precursors or haemogenic endothelial cells remains controversial(2-9). Proximity of endothelial and blood cells at sites of embryonic haematopoiesis, as well as their similar gene expression, led to the hypothesis of the endothelium generating blood. However, owing to lacking technology(10) it has been impossible to observe blood cell emergence continuously at the single- cell level, and the postulated existence of haemogenic endothelial cells remains disputed(1). Here, using new imaging and cell- tracking methods, we show that embryonic endothelial cells can be haemogenic. By continuous long- term single- cell observation of mouse mesodermal cells generating endothelial cell and blood colonies, it was possible to detect haemogenic endothelial cells giving rise to blood cells. Living endothelial and haematopoietic cells were identified by simultaneous detection of morphology and multiple molecular and functional markers. Detachment of nascent blood cells from endothelium is not directly linked to asymmetric cell division, and haemogenic endothelial cells are specified from cells already expressing endothelial markers. These results improve our understanding of the developmental origin of mammalian blood and the potential generation of haematopoietic stem cells from embryonic stem cells.","Eilken, Hanna M.; Nishikawa, Shin-Ichi; Schroeder, Timm","Eilken, HM; Nishikawa, SI; Schroeder, T",896.0,"[Eilken, Hanna M.; Schroeder, Timm] Helmholtz Ctr Munich, German Res Ctr Environm Hlth GmbH, Inst Stem Cell Res, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany; [Nishikawa, Shin-Ichi] RIKEN, Ctr Dev Biol, Lab Stem Cell Biol, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07760,Article,,timm.schroeder@helmholtz-muenchen.de,900,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Leading Project for the Realization of Regenerative Medicine,"We are grateful to S.

22,11,212.0,"Variation in transcriptional regulation is thought to be a major cause of phenotypic diversity(1,2). Although widespread differences in gene expression among individuals of a species have been observed(3-8), studies to examine the variability of transcription factor binding on a global scale have not been performed, and thus the extent and underlying genetic basis of transcription factor binding diversity is unknown. By mapping differences in transcription factor binding among individuals, here we present the genetic basis of such variation on a genome-wide scale. Whole-genome Ste12-binding profiles were determined using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with DNA sequencing in pheromone-treated cells of 43 segregants of a cross between two highly diverged yeast strains and their parental lines. We identified extensive Ste12-binding variation among individuals, and mapped underlying cis- and trans-acting loci responsible for such variation. We showed that most transcription factor binding variation is cis- linked, and that many variations are associated with polymorphisms residing in the binding motifs of Ste12 as well as those of several proposed Ste12 cofactors. We also identified two transfactors, AMN1 and FLO8, that modulate Ste12 binding to promoters of more than ten genes under alpha-factor treatment. Neither of these two genes was previously known to regulate Ste12, and we suggest that they may be mediators of gene activity and phenotypic diversity. Ste12 binding strongly correlates with gene expression for more than 200 genes, indicating that binding variation is functional. Many of the variable-bound genes are involved in cell wall organization and biogenesis. Overall, these studies identified genetic regulators of molecular diversity among individuals and provide new insights into mechanisms of gene regulation.","Zheng, Wei; Zhao, Hongyu; Mancera, Eugenio; Steinmetz, Lars M.; Snyder, Michael","Zheng, W; Zhao, HY; Mancera, E; Steinmetz, LM; Snyder, M",1187.0,"[Zheng, Wei; Snyder, Michael] Yale Univ, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Zhao, Hongyu] Yale Univ, Program Computat Biol & Bioinformat, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Zhao, Hongyu] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Mancera, Eugenio; Steinmetz, Lars M.] European Mol Biol Lab, Genome Biol Unit, Heidelberg, Germany; [Snyder, Michael] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08934,Article,,mpsnyder@stanford.edu,U106,National Institutes of Health (NIH) [RR19895],"We thank J.

23,70,27.0,"The United States is now experiencing the most rapid expansion in oil and gas production in four decades, owing in large part to implementation of new extraction technologies such as horizontal drilling combined with hydraulic fracturing. The environmental impacts of this development, from its effect on water quality(1) to the influence of increased methane leakage on climate(2), have been a matter of intense debate. Air quality impacts are associated with emissions of nitrogen oxides(3,4) (NOx = NO + NO2) and volatile organic compounds(5-7) (VOCs), whose photochemistry leads to production of ozone, a secondary pollutant with negative health effects(8). Recent observations in oil-and gas-producing basins in the western United States have identified ozone mixing ratios well in excess of present air quality standards, but only during winter(9-13). Understanding winter ozone production in these regions is scientifically challenging. It occurs during cold periods of snow cover when meteorological inversions concentrate air pollutants from oil and gas activities, but when solar irradiance and absolute humidity, which are both required to initiate conventional photochemistry essential for ozone production, are at a minimum. Here, using data from a remote location in the oil and gas basin of northeastern Utah and a box model, we provide a quantitative assessment of the photochemistry that leads to these extreme winter ozone pollution events, and identify key factors that control ozone production in this unique environment. We find that ozone production occurs at lower NOx and much larger VOC concentrations than does its summertime urban counterpart, leading to carbonyl (oxygenated VOCs with a C=O moiety) photolysis as a dominant oxidant source. Extreme VOC concentrations optimize the ozone production efficiency of NOx. There is considerable potential for global growth in oil and gas extraction from shale. This analysis could help inform strategies to monitor and mitigate air quality impacts and provide broader insight into the response of winter ozone to primary pollutants.","Edwards, Peter M.; Brown, Steven S.; Roberts, James M.; Ahmadov, Ravan; Banta, Robert M.; deGouw, Joost A.; Dube, William P.; Field, Robert A.; Flynn, James H.; Gilman, Jessica B.; Graus, Martin; Helmig, Detlev; Koss, Abigail; Langford, Andrew O.; Lefer, Barry L.; Lerner, Brian M.; Li, Rui; Li, Shao-Meng; McKeen, Stuart A.; Murphy, Shane M.; Parrish, David D.; Senff, Christoph J.; Soltis, Jeffrey; Stutz, Jochen; Sweeney, Colm; Thompson, Chelsea R.; Trainer, Michael K.; Tsai, Catalina; Veres, Patrick R.; Washenfelder, Rebecca A.; Warneke, Carsten; Wild, Robert J.; Young, Cora J.; Yuan, Bin; Zamora, Robert","Edwards, PM; Brown, SS; Roberts, JM; Ahmadov, R; Banta, RM; deGouw, JA; Dube, WP; Field, RA; Flynn, JH; Gilman, JB; Graus, M; Helmig, D; Koss, A; Langford, AO; Lefer, BL; Lerner, BM; Li, R; Li, SM; McKeen, SA; Murphy, SM; Parrish, DD; Senff, CJ; Soltis, J; Stutz, J; Sweeney, C; Thompson, CR; Trainer, MK; Tsai, C; Veres, PR; Washenfelder, RA; Warneke, C; Wild, RJ; Young, CJ; Yuan, B; Zamora, R",351.0,"[Edwards, Peter M.; Brown, Steven S.; Roberts, James M.; Ahmadov, Ravan; Banta, Robert M.; deGouw, Joost A.; Dube, William P.; Gilman, Jessica B.; Graus, Martin; Koss, Abigail; Langford, Andrew O.; Lerner, Brian M.; Li, Rui; McKeen, Stuart A.; Parrish, David D.; Senff, Christoph J.; Sweeney, Colm; Trainer, Michael K.; Veres, Patrick R.; Washenfelder, Rebecca A.; Warneke, Carsten; Wild, Robert J.; Young, Cora J.; Yuan, Bin; Zamora, Robert] NOAA, Earth Syst Res Lab, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; [Edwards, Peter M.; Ahmadov, Ravan; deGouw, Joost A.; Dube, William P.; Gilman, Jessica B.; Graus, Martin; Koss, Abigail; Lerner, Brian M.; Li, Rui; McKeen, Stuart A.; Senff, Christoph J.; Sweeney, Colm; Veres, Patrick R.; Washenfelder, Rebecca A.; Warneke, Carsten; Wild, Robert J.; Yuan, Bin] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Field, Robert A.; Murphy, Shane M.; Soltis, Jeffrey] Univ Wyoming, Dept Atmospher Sci, Larmie, WY 82070 USA; [Flynn, James H.; Lefer, Barry L.] Univ Houston, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Houston, TX 77204 USA; [Helmig, Detlev; Thompson, Chelsea R.] Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Li, Shao-Meng] Environm Canada, Air Qual Res Div, Toronto, ON M3H 5T4, Canada; [Stutz, Jochen; Tsai, Catalina] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13767,Article,1476-4687,steven.s.brown@noaa.gov,+,"Uintah Impact Mitigation Special Service District (UIMSSD); Bureau of Land Management (BLM); Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); Utah State University; Western Energy Alliance; NOAA's Atmospheric Chemistry, Climate and Carbon Cycle programme; Questar Energy Products; National Science Foundation [1212666, 1215926]","The Uintah Basin Winter Ozone Studies were a joint project led and coordinated by the Utah Department of Environmental Quality (UDEQ) and supported by the Uintah Impact Mitigation Special Service District (UIMSSD), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Utah State University.

24,125,345.0,"Despite tremendous efforts, development of an effective vaccine against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has proved an elusive goal. Recently, however, numerous antibodies have been identified that are capable of neutralizing most circulating HIV strains(1-5). These antibodies all exhibit an unusually high level of somatic mutation(6), presumably owing to extensive affinity maturation over the course of continuous exposure to an evolving antigen(7). Although substantial effort has focused on the design of immunogens capable of eliciting antibodies de novo that would target similar epitopes(8-10), it remains uncertain whether a conventional vaccine will be able to elicit analogues of the existing broadly neutralizing antibodies. As an alternative to immunization, vector-mediated gene transfer could be used to engineer secretion of the existing broadly neutralizing antibodies into the circulation. Here we describe a practical implementation of this approach, which we call vectored immunoprophylaxis (VIP), which in mice induces lifelong expression of these monoclonal antibodies at high concentrations from a single intramuscular injection. This is achieved using a specialized adeno-associated virus vector optimized for the production of full-length antibody from muscle tissue. We show that humanized mice receiving VIP appear to be fully protected from HIV infection, even when challenged intravenously with very high doses of replication-competent virus. Our results suggest that successful translation of this approach to humans may produce effective prophylaxis against HIV.","Balazs, Alejandro B.; Chen, Joyce; Hong, Christin M.; Rao, Dinesh S.; Yang, Lili; Baltimore, David","Balazs, AB; Chen, J; Hong, CM; Rao, DS; Yang, LL; Baltimore, D",81.0,"[Balazs, Alejandro B.; Chen, Joyce; Hong, Christin M.; Yang, Lili; Baltimore, David] CALTECH, Div Biol, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Rao, Dinesh S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10660,Article,,baltimo@caltech.edu,U88,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation through Grand Challenges in Global Health Initiative [37866]; National Institutes of Health through the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) [HHSN266200500035C]; Joint Center for Translational Medicine; amfAR [107756-47-RFVA]; National Institutes of Health [1K08CA133521],"We thank J.

25,94,87.0,"Gene expression differs among individuals and populations and is thought to be a major determinant of phenotypic variation. Although variation and genetic loci responsible for RNA expression levels have been analysed extensively in human populations(1-5), our knowledge is limited regarding the differences in human protein abundance and the genetic basis for this difference. Variation in messenger RNA expression is not a perfect surrogate for protein expression because the latter is influenced by an array of post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, and, empirically, the correlation between protein and mRNA levels is generally modest(6,7). Here we used isobaric tag-based quantitative mass spectrometry to determine relative protein levels of 5,953 genes in lymphoblastoid cell lines from 95 diverse individuals genotyped in the HapMap Project(8,9). We found that protein levels are heritable molecular phenotypes that exhibit considerable variation between individuals, populations and sexes. Levels of specific sets of proteins involved in the same biological process covary among individuals, indicating that these processes are tightly regulated at the protein level. We identified cis-pQTLs (protein quantitative trait loci), including variants not detected by previous transcriptome studies. This study demonstrates the feasibility of high-throughput human proteome quantification that, when integrated with DNA variation and transcriptome information, adds a new dimension to the characterization of gene expression regulation.","Wu, Linfeng; Candille, Sophie I.; Choi, Yoonha; Xie, Dan; Jiang, Lihua; Li-Pook-Than, Jennifer; Tang, Hua; Snyder, Michael","Wu, LF; Candille, SI; Choi, Y; Xie, D; Jiang, LH; Li-Pook-Than, J; Tang, H; Snyder, M",79.0,"[Wu, Linfeng; Candille, Sophie I.; Choi, Yoonha; Xie, Dan; Jiang, Lihua; Li-Pook-Than, Jennifer; Tang, Hua; Snyder, Michael] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12223,Article,,huatang@stanford.edu; mpsnyder@stanford.edu,82,NIH,We thank S.

26,12,256.0,"Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), retrovirus-like elements with long terminal repeats, are widely dispersed in the euchromatic compartment in mammalian cells, comprising similar to 10% of the mouse genome(1). These parasitic elements are responsible for >10% of spontaneous mutations(2). Whereas DNA methylation has an important role in proviral silencing in somatic and germ-lineage cells(3-5), an additional DNA-methylation-independent pathway also functions in embryonal carcinoma and embryonic stem (ES) cells to inhibit transcription of the exogenous gammaretrovirus murine leukaemia virus (MLV)(6-8). Notably, a recent genome-wide study revealed that ERVs are also marked by histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) and H4K20me3 in ES cells but not in mouse embryonic fibroblasts(9). However, the role that these marks have in proviral silencing remains unexplored. Here we show that the H3K9 methyltransferase ESET (also called SETDB1 or KMT1E) and the Kruppel-associated box (KRAB)associated protein 1 (KAP1, also called TRIM28)(10,11) are required for H3K9me3 and silencing of endogenous and introduced retroviruses specifically in mouse ES cells. Furthermore, whereas ESET enzymatic activity is crucial for HP1 binding and efficient proviral silencing, the H4K20 methyltransferases Suv420h1 and Suv420h2 are dispensable for silencing. Notably, in DNA methyltransferase triple knockout (Dnmt1(-/-) Dnmt3a(-/-) Dnmt3b(-/-)) mouse ES cells, ESET and KAP1 binding and ESET-mediated H3K9me3 are maintained and ERVs are minimally derepressed. We propose that a DNA-methylation-independent pathway involving KAP1 and ESET/ESET-mediated H3K9me3 is required for proviral silencing during the period early in embryogenesis when DNA methylation is dynamically reprogrammed.","Matsui, Toshiyuki; Leung, Danny; Miyashita, Hiroki; Maksakova, Irina A.; Miyachi, Hitoshi; Kimura, Hiroshi; Tachibana, Makoto; Lorincz, Matthew C.; Shinkai, Yoichi","Matsui, T; Leung, D; Miyashita, H; Maksakova, IA; Miyachi, H; Kimura, H; Tachibana, M; Lorincz, MC; Shinkai, Y",927.0,"[Matsui, Toshiyuki; Miyashita, Hiroki; Miyachi, Hitoshi; Tachibana, Makoto; Shinkai, Yoichi] Kyoto Univ, Inst Virus Res, Expt Res Ctr Infect Dis, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068507, Japan; [Matsui, Toshiyuki; Miyashita, Hiroki; Tachibana, Makoto; Shinkai, Yoichi] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Biostudies, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068507, Japan; [Leung, Danny; Maksakova, Irina A.; Lorincz, Matthew C.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Med Genet, Inst Life Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada; [Kimura, Hiroshi] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Frontier Biosci, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08858,Article,,mlorincz@interchange.ubc.ca; yshinkai@virus.kyoto-u.ac.jp,U149,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan; CIHR [77805, 92090]","We thank M.

27,35,80.0,"The E2F family is conserved from Caenorhabditis elegans to mammals, with some family members having transcription activation functions and others having repressor functions(1,2). Whereas C. elegans(3) and Drosophila melanogaster(4,5) have a single E2F activator protein and repressor protein, mammals have at least three activator and five repressor proteins(1,2,6). Why such genetic complexity evolved in mammals is not known. To begin to evaluate this genetic complexity, we targeted the inactivation of the entire subset of activators, E2f1, E2f2, E2f3a and E2f3b, singly or in combination in mice. We demonstrate that E2f3a is sufficient to support mouse embryonic and postnatal development. Remarkably, expression of E2f3b or E2f1 from the E2f3a locus ( E2f3a(3bki) or E2f3a(1ki), respectively) suppressed all the postnatal phenotypes associated with the inactivation of E2f3a. We conclude that there is significant functional redundancy among activators and that the specific requirement for E2f3a during postnatal development is dictated by regulatory sequences governing its selective spatiotemporal expression and not by its intrinsic protein functions. These findings provide a molecular basis for the observed specificity among E2F activators during development.","Tsai, Shih-Yin; Opavsky, Rene; Sharma, Nidhi; Wu, Lizhao; Naidu, Shan; Nolan, Eric; Feria-Arias, Enrique; Timmers, Cynthia; Opavska, Jana; de Bruin, Alain; Chong, Jean-Leon; Trikha, Prashant; Fernandez, Soledad A.; Stromberg, Paul; Rosol, Thomas J.; Leone, Gustavo","Tsai, SY; Opavsky, R; Sharma, N; Wu, LZ; Naidu, S; Nolan, E; Feria-Arias, E; Timmers, C; Opavska, J; de Bruin, A; Chong, JL; Trikha, P; Fernandez, SA; Stromberg, P; Rosol, TJ; Leone, G",1137.0,"[Tsai, Shih-Yin; Opavsky, Rene; Sharma, Nidhi; Wu, Lizhao; Nolan, Eric; Feria-Arias, Enrique; Timmers, Cynthia; Opavska, Jana; de Bruin, Alain; Chong, Jean-Leon; Trikha, Prashant; Leone, Gustavo] Ohio State Univ, Dept Mol Genet, Coll Biol Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Tsai, Shih-Yin; Opavsky, Rene; Sharma, Nidhi; Wu, Lizhao; Naidu, Shan; Nolan, Eric; Feria-Arias, Enrique; Timmers, Cynthia; Opavska, Jana; de Bruin, Alain; Chong, Jean-Leon; Trikha, Prashant; Leone, Gustavo] Ohio State Univ, Ctr Comprehens Canc, Human Canc Genet Program, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Tsai, Shih-Yin; Opavsky, Rene; Sharma, Nidhi; Wu, Lizhao; Naidu, Shan; Nolan, Eric; Feria-Arias, Enrique; Timmers, Cynthia; Opavska, Jana; de Bruin, Alain; Chong, Jean-Leon; Trikha, Prashant; Leone, Gustavo] Ohio State Univ, Dept Mol Virol Immunol & Med Genet, Coll Med, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Naidu, Shan; Stromberg, Paul; Rosol, Thomas J.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Vet Biosci, Coll Vet Med, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Fernandez, Soledad A.] Ohio State Univ, Ctr Biostat, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07066,Article,,Gustavo.Leone@osumc.edu,U69,"NIH [R01CA85619, R01HD042619, R01CA121275, R01HD047470, P01CA097189, K01CA102328]; DoD awards [BC0300893, BC061730]; T32 fellowship [CA106196]; Pew Charitable Trusts Scholar Award; Leukemia and Lymphoma Society Scholar Award","We thank J.

28,4,373.0,"The development of the human cerebral cortex is an orchestrated process involving the generation of neural progenitors in the periventricular germinal zones, cell proliferation characterized by symmetric and asymmetric mitoses, followed by migration of post-mitotic neurons to their final destinations in six highly ordered, functionally specialized layers(1,2). An understanding of the molecular mechanisms guiding these intricate processes is in its infancy, substantially driven by the discovery of rare mutations that cause malformations of cortical development(3-6). Mapping of disease loci in putative Mendelian forms of malformations of cortical development has been hindered by marked locus heterogeneity, small kindred sizes and diagnostic classifications that may not reflect molecular pathogenesis. Here we demonstrate the use of whole-exome sequencing to overcome these obstacles by identifying recessive mutations in WD repeat domain 62 (WDR62) as the cause of a wide spectrum of severe cerebral cortical malformations including microcephaly, pachygyria with cortical thickening as well as hypoplasia of the corpus callosum. Some patients with mutations in WDR62 had evidence of additional abnormalities including lissencephaly, schizencephaly, polymicrogyria and, in one instance, cerebellar hypoplasia, all traits traditionally regarded as distinct entities. In mice and humans, WDR62 transcripts and protein are enriched in neural progenitors within the ventricular and subventricular zones. Expression of WDR62 in the neocortex is transient, spanning the period of embryonic neurogenesis. Unlike other known microcephaly genes, WDR62 does not apparently associate with centrosomes and is predominantly nuclear in localization. These findings unify previously disparate aspects of cerebral cortical development and highlight the use of whole-exome sequencing to identify disease loci in settings in which traditional methods have proved challenging.","Bilguvar, Kaya; Ozturk, Ali Kemal; Louvi, Angeliki; Kwan, Kenneth Y.; Choi, Murim; Tatli, Burak; Yalnizoglu, Dilek; Tuysuz, Beyhan; Caglayan, Ahmet Okay; Gokben, Sarenur; Kaymakcalan, Hande; Barak, Tanyeri; Bakircioglu, Mehmet; Yasuno, Katsuhito; Ho, Winson; Sanders, Stephan; Zhu, Ying; Yilmaz, Sanem; Dincer, Alp; Johnson, Michele H.; Bronen, Richard A.; Kocer, Naci; Per, Hueseyin; Mane, Shrikant; Pamir, Mehmet Necmettin; Yalcinkaya, Cengiz; Kumandas, Sefer; Topcu, Meral; Ozmen, Meral; Sestan, Nenad; Lifton, Richard P.; State, Matthew W.; Gunel, Murat","Bilguvar, K; Ozturk, AK; Louvi, A; Kwan, KY; Choi, M; Tatli, B; Yalnizoglu, D; Tuysuz, B; Caglayan, AO; Gokben, S; Kaymakcalan, H; Barak, T; Bakircioglu, M; Yasuno, K; Ho, W; Sanders, S; Zhu, Y; Yilmaz, S; Dincer, A; Johnson, MH; Bronen, RA; Kocer, N; Per, H; Mane, S; Pamir, MN; Yalcinkaya, C; Kumandas, S; Topcu, M; Ozmen, M; Sestan, N; Lifton, RP; State, MW; Gunel, M",207.0,"[Bilguvar, Kaya; Ozturk, Ali Kemal; Louvi, Angeliki; Choi, Murim; Barak, Tanyeri; Bakircioglu, Mehmet; Yasuno, Katsuhito; Ho, Winson; Sanders, Stephan; Mane, Shrikant; Lifton, Richard P.; State, Matthew W.; Gunel, Murat] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Ctr Human Genet & Genom, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Bilguvar, Kaya; Ozturk, Ali Kemal; Louvi, Angeliki; Choi, Murim; Barak, Tanyeri; Bakircioglu, Mehmet; Yasuno, Katsuhito; Ho, Winson; Sanders, Stephan; Mane, Shrikant; Lifton, Richard P.; State, Matthew W.; Gunel, Murat] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Program Neurogenet, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Bilguvar, Kaya; Ozturk, Ali Kemal; Louvi, Angeliki; Barak, Tanyeri; Bakircioglu, Mehmet; Yasuno, Katsuhito; Ho, Winson; Johnson, Michele H.; Bronen, Richard A.; Gunel, Murat] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosurg, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Bilguvar, Kaya; Ozturk, Ali Kemal; Louvi, Angeliki; Kwan, Kenneth Y.; Barak, Tanyeri; Bakircioglu, Mehmet; Yasuno, Katsuhito; Ho, Winson; Zhu, Ying; Sestan, Nenad; Gunel, Murat] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Kwan, Kenneth Y.; Zhu, Ying; Sestan, Nenad] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Kavli Inst Neurosci, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Tatli, Burak; Ozmen, Meral] Istanbul Univ, Istanbul Fac Med, Dept Pediat, Div Neurol, TR-34093 Istanbul, Turkey; [Yalnizoglu, Dilek; Topcu, Meral] Hacettepe Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Div Neurol, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey; [Tuysuz, Beyhan] Istanbul Univ, Cerrahpasa Fac Med, Dept Pediat, Div Genet, TR-34098 Istanbul, Turkey; [Caglayan, Ahmet Okay] Kayseri Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Med Genet, TR-38010 Kayseri, Turkey; [Gokben, Sarenur; Yilmaz, Sanem] Ege Univ, Fac Med, Dept Pediat, Div Neurol, TR-35100 Izmir, Turkey; [Kaymakcalan, Hande] Bahcesehir Univ, Fac Arts & Sci, TR-34353 Istanbul, Turkey; [Sanders, Stephan; State, Matthew W.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Sanders, Stephan; State, Matthew W.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Child Study, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Dincer, Alp] Acibadem Univ, Sch Med, Dept Radiol, TR-34742 Istanbul, Turkey; [Johnson, Michele H.; Bronen, Richard A.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Radiol, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Johnson, Michele H.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Otolaryngol, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Kocer, Naci] Istanbul Univ, Cerrahpasa Fac Med, Dept Radiol, TR-34098 Istanbul, Turkey; [Per, Hueseyin; Kumandas, Sefer] Erciyes Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Div Neurol, TR-38039 Kayseri, Turkey; [Mane, Shrikant] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Yale Ctr Genome Anal, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Pamir, Mehmet Necmettin] Acibadem Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosurg, TR-34742 Istanbul, Turkey; [Yalcinkaya, Cengiz] Istanbul Univ, Cerrahpasa Fac Med, Dept Neurol, Div Child Neurol, TR-34098 Istanbul, Turkey; [Lifton, Richard P.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New Haven, CT 06510 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09327,Article,,richard.lifton@yale.edu; matthew.state@yale.edu; murat.gunel@yale.edu,U93,"Yale Program on Neurogenetics; Yale Center for Human Genetics and Genomics; National Institutes of Health [RC2 NS070477, UL1 RR024139NIH, UO1MH081896]; National Institutes of Health Neuroscience Microarray Consortium [U24 NS051869-02S1]","We are indebted to the patients and families who have contributed to this study.

29,57,108.0,"The neural crest is an evolutionary novelty that fostered the emergence of vertebrate anatomical innovations such as the cranium and jaws(1). During embryonic development, multipotent neural crest cells are specified at the lateral borders of the neural plate before delaminating, migrating and differentiating into various cell types. In invertebrate chordates (cephalochordates and tunicates), neural plate border cells express conserved factors such as Msx, Snail and Pax3/7 and generate melanin-containing pigment cells(2-4), a derivative of the neural crest in vertebrates. However, invertebrate neural plate border cells have not been shown to generate homologues of other neural crest derivatives. Thus, proposed models of neural crest evolution postulate vertebrate-specific elaborations on an ancestral neural plate border program, through acquisition of migratory capabilities and the potential to generate several cell types(5-7). Here we show that a particular neuronal cell type in the tadpole larva of the tunicate Ciona intestinalis, the bipolar tail neuron, shares a set of features with neural-crest-derived spinal ganglia neurons in vertebrates. Bipolar tail neuron precursors derive from caudal neural plate border cells, delaminate and migrate along the paraxial mesoderm on either side of the neural tube, eventually differentiating into afferent neurons that form synaptic contacts with both epidermal sensory cells and motor neurons. We propose that the neural plate borders of the chordate ancestor already produced migratory peripheral neurons and pigment cells, and that the neural crest evolved through the acquisition of a multipotent progenitor regulatory state upstream of multiple, pre-existing neural plate border cell differentiation programs.","Stolfi, Alberto; Ryan, Kerrianne; Meinertzhagen, Ian A.; Christiaen, Lionel","Stolfi, A; Ryan, K; Meinertzhagen, IA; Christiaen, L",371.0,"[Stolfi, Alberto; Christiaen, Lionel] NYU, Dept Biol, Ctr Dev Genet, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Ryan, Kerrianne; Meinertzhagen, Ian A.] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Psychol & Neurosci, Life Sci Ctr, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15758,Article,1476-4687,lc121@nyu.edu,+,National Science Foundation [NSF-1161835]; National Institutes of Health [GM096032]; NSERC (Ottawa) [DIS0000065],"The authors would like to thank F.

30,37,238.0,"The mass and chemical composition of a star are the primary determinants of its basic physical properties - radius, temperature and luminosity - and how those properties evolve with time(1). Accordingly, two stars born at the same time, from the same natal material and with the same mass, are 'identical twins,' and as such might be expected to possess identical physical attributes. We have discovered in the Orion nebula a pair of stellar twins in a newborn binary star system(2). Each star in the binary has a mass of 0.41 +/- 0.01 solar masses, identical to within 2 per cent. Here we report that these twin stars have surface temperatures differing by similar to 300 K (similar to 10 per cent) and luminosities differing by similar to 50 per cent, both at high confidence level. Preliminary results indicate that the stars' radii also differ, by 5 - 10 per cent. These surprising dissimilarities suggest that one of the twins may have been delayed by several hundred thousand years in its formation relative to its sibling. Such a delay could only have been detected in a very young, definitively equal-mass binary system(3). Our findings reveal cosmic limits on the age synchronization of young binary stars, often used as tests for the age calibrations of star-formation models(4).","Stassun, Keivan G.; Mathieu, Robert D.; Cargile, Phillip A.; Aarnio, Alicia N.; Stempels, Eric; Geller, Aaron","Stassun, KG; Mathieu, RD; Cargile, PA; Aarnio, AN; Stempels, E; Geller, A",1079.0,"[Stassun, Keivan G.; Cargile, Phillip A.; Aarnio, Alicia N.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Mathieu, Robert D.; Geller, Aaron] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Astron, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Stempels, Eric] Univ St Andrews, Sch Phys & Astron, St Andrews KY16 9SS, Fife, Scotland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07069,Article,,keivan.stassun@vanderbilt.edu,1082,,,314WM,,,ORION NEBULA CLUSTER; SEQUENCE ECLIPSING BINARY; LOW-MASS; ABSOLUTE CALIBRATION; FORMING REGION; BROWN DWARFS; SYSTEM; 2MASS; TEMPERATURES; PHOTOMETRY,7198.0,NATURE,Nature,English,29.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",19-Jun,4.0,LONDON,18563159.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,,"Stassun, KG (reprint author), Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,39.0,Surprising dissimilarities in a newly formed pair of 'identical twin' stars,0.0,3.0,WOS:000256839900051,238.0,453,Multidisciplinary Sciences,40,aaron,geller,1008.0,2280,male,1.0,PyNOB1EAAAAJ,1,"[0, 1474]",34068800,1,5923637,1,Laura Geller,Laura Geller,1,1
31,58,314.0,"Chronic inflammation has long been associated with increased incidence of malignancy and similarities in the regulatory mechanisms have been suggested for more than a century(1). Infiltration of innate immune cells, elevated activities of matrix metalloproteases and increased angiogenesis and vasculature density are a few examples of the similarities between chronic and tumour-associated inflammation(2). Conversely, the elimination of early malignant lesions by immune surveillance, which relies on the cytotoxic activity of tumour-infiltrating T cells or intra-epithelial lymphocytes, is thought to be rate-limiting for the risk to develop cancer(3). Here we show a molecular connection between the rise in tumour-associated inflammation and a lack of tumour immune surveillance. Expression of the heterodimeric cytokine interleukin (IL)-23, but not of its close relative IL-12, is increased in human tumours. Expression of these cytokines antagonistically regulates local inflammatory responses in the tumour microenvironment and infiltration of intra-epithelial lymphocytes. Whereas IL-12 promotes infiltration of cytotoxic T cells, IL-23 promotes inflammatory responses such as upregulation of the matrix metalloprotease MMP9, and increases angiogenesis but reduces CD8 T-cell infiltration. Genetic deletion or antibody-mediated elimination of IL-23 leads to increased infiltration of cytotoxic T cells into the transformed tissue, rendering a protective effect against chemically induced carcinogenesis. Finally, transplanted tumours are growth-restricted in hosts depleted for IL-23 or in IL-23-receptor-deficient mice. Although many strategies for immune therapy of cancer attempt to stimulate an immune response against solid tumours, infiltration of effector cells into the tumour tissue often appears to be a critical hurdle(4-7). We show that IL-23 is an important molecular link between tumour-promoting pro-inflammatory processes and the failure of the adaptive immune surveillance to infiltrate tumours.","Langowski, John L.; Zhang, Xueqing; Wu, Lingling; Mattson, Jeanine D.; Chen, Taiying; Smith, Kathy; Basham, Beth; McClanahan, Terrill; Kastelein, Robert A.; Oft, Martin","Langowski, JL; Zhang, XQ; Wu, LL; Mattson, JD; Chen, TY; Smith, K; Basham, B; McClanahan, T; Kastelein, RA; Oft, M",461.0,"Schering Plough BioPharma, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature04808,Article,,martin.oft@spcorp.com,465,,,067CI,,,AUTOIMMUNE INFLAMMATION; ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY; T-CELLS; CANCER; SKIN; DISTINCT; INTERLEUKIN-12; RESISTANCE; CYTOKINE; IL-12,7101.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",27-Jul,5.0,LONDON,16688182.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,,"Oft, M (reprint author), Schering Plough BioPharma, 901 Calif Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,575.0,IL-23 promotes tumour incidence and growth,1.0,35.0,WOS:000239278900045,314.0,442,Multidisciplinary Sciences,616,martin,oft,3856.0,3568,male,1.0,c_Xosd0AAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",33768385,1,709683,1,Exploration Flight Test 1,Exploration Flight Test 1,0,0
32,104,141.0,"River systems connect the terrestrial biosphere, the atmosphere and the ocean in the global carbon cycle(1). A recent estimate suggests that up to 3 petagrams of carbon per year could be emitted as carbon dioxide (CO2) from global inland waters, offsetting the carbon uptake by terrestrial ecosystems(2). It is generally assumed that inland waters emit carbon that has been previously fixed upstream by land plant photosynthesis, then transferred to soils, and subsequently transported downstream in run-off. But at the scale of entire drainage basins, the lateral carbon fluxes carried by small rivers upstream do not account for all of the CO2 emitted from inundated areas downstream(3,4). Three-quarters of the world's flooded land consists of temporary wetlands(5), but the contribution of these productive ecosystems(6) to the inland water carbon budget has been largely overlooked. Here we show that wetlands pump large amounts of atmospheric CO2 into river waters in the floodplains of the central Amazon. Flooded forests and floating vegetation export large amounts of carbon to river waters and the dissolved CO2 can be transported dozens to hundreds of kilometres downstream before being emitted. We estimate that Amazonian wetlands export half of their gross primary production to river waters as dissolved CO2 and organic carbon, compared with only a few per cent of gross primary production exported in upland (not flooded) ecosystems(1,7). Moreover, we suggest that wetland carbon export is potentially large enough to account for at least the 0.21 petagrams of carbon emitted per year as CO2 from the central Amazon River and its floodplains(8). Global carbon budgets should explicitly address temporary or vegetated flooded areas, because these ecosystems combine high aerial primary production with large, fast carbon export, potentially supporting a substantial fraction of CO2 evasion from inland waters.","Abril, Gwenael; Martinez, Jean-Michel; Artigas, L.

33,9,42.0,"The modern giant sperm whale Physeter macrocephalus, one of the largest known predators, preys upon cephalopods at great depths(1,2). Lacking a functional upper dentition, it relies on suction for catching its prey(3); in contrast, several smaller Miocene sperm whales (Physeteroidea) have been interpreted as raptorial (versus suction) feeders(4,5), analogous to the modern killer whale Orcinus orca. Whereas very large physeteroid teeth have been discovered in various Miocene localities, associated diagnostic cranial remains have not been found so far(6-8). Here we report the discovery of a new giant sperm whale from the Middle Miocene of Peru (approximately 12-13 million years ago), Leviathan melvillei, described on the basis of a skull with teeth and mandible. With a 3-m-long head, very large upper and lower teeth (maximum diameter and length of 12 cm and greater than 36 cm, respectively), robust jaws and a temporal fossa considerably larger than in Physeter, this stem physeteroid represents one of the largest raptorial predators and, to our knowledge, the biggest tetrapod bite ever found. The appearance of gigantic raptorial sperm whales in the fossil record coincides with a phase of diversification and size-range increase of the baleen-bearing mysticetes in the Miocene. We propose that Leviathan fed mostly on high-energy content medium-size baleen whales. As a top predator, together with the contemporaneous giant shark Carcharocles megalodon, it probably had a profound impact on the structuring of Miocene marine communities. The development of a vast supracranial basin in Leviathan, extending on the rostrum as in Physeter, might indicate the presence of an enlarged spermaceti organ in the former that is not associated with deep diving or obligatory suction feeding.","Lambert, Olivier; Bianucci, Giovanni; Post, Klaas; de Muizon, Christian; Salas-Gismondi, Rodolfo; Urbina, Mario; Reumer, Jelle","Lambert, O; Bianucci, G; Post, K; de Muizon, C; Salas-Gismondi, R; Urbina, M; Reumer, J",105.0,"[Lambert, Olivier] Inst Royal Sci Nat Belgique, Dept Paleontol, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [Bianucci, Giovanni] Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Sci Terra, I-56126 Pisa, Italy; [Post, Klaas; Reumer, Jelle] Nat Hist Museum Rotterdam, NL-3001 KL Rotterdam, Netherlands; [de Muizon, Christian] Museum Natl Hist Nat, Dept Hist Terre, F-75005 Paris, France; [Salas-Gismondi, Rodolfo; Urbina, Mario] Univ Nacl Mayor San Marcos, Museo Hist Nat, Lima 14, Peru; [Reumer, Jelle] Univ Utrecht, Dept Geosci, NL-3508 TA Utrecht, Netherlands",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09067,Article,,olambert@mnhn.fr; bianucci@dst.unipi.it,108,Board of the Natuurhistorisch Museum Rotterdam Foundation; Belgian Federal Science Policy Office,"We thank W.

34,89,224.0,"During development, thalamocortical (TC) input has a critical role in the spatial delineation and patterning of cortical areas(1-6), yet the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive cortical neuron differentiation are poorly understood. In the primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory cortex, layer 4 (L4) neurons receive mutually exclusive input originating from two thalamic nuclei(7,8): the ventrobasalis (VB), which conveys tactile input(9,10), and the posterior nucleus (Po), which conveys modulatory and nociceptive input(11-14). Recently, we have shown that L4 neuron identity is not fully committed postnatally(15), implying a capacity for TC input to influence differentiation during cortical circuit assembly. Here we investigate whether the cell-type-specific molecular and functional identity of L4 neurons is instructed by the origin of their TC input. Genetic ablation of the VB at birth resulted in an anatomical and functional rewiring of Po projections onto L4 neurons in S1. This induced acquisition of Po input led to a respecification of postsynaptic L4 neurons, which developed functional molecular features of Po-target neurons while repressing VB-target traits. Respecified L4 neurons were able to respond both to touch and to noxious stimuli, in sharp contrast to the normal segregation of these sensory modalities in distinct cortical circuits. These findings reveal a behaviourally relevant TC-input-type-specific control over the molecular and functional differentiation of postsynaptic L4 neurons and cognate intracortical circuits, which instructs the development of modality-specific neuronal and circuit properties during corticogenesis.","Pouchelon, Gabrielle; Gambino, Frederic; Bellone, Camilla; Telley, Ludovic; Vitali, Ilaria; Luescher, Christian; Holtmaat, Anthony; Jabaudon, Denis","Pouchelon, G; Gambino, F; Bellone, C; Telley, L; Vitali, I; Luscher, C; Holtmaat, A; Jabaudon, D",471.0,"[Pouchelon, Gabrielle; Gambino, Frederic; Bellone, Camilla; Telley, Ludovic; Vitali, Ilaria; Luescher, Christian; Holtmaat, Anthony; Jabaudon, Denis] Univ Geneva, Fac Med, Dept Basic Neurosci, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Luescher, Christian; Jabaudon, Denis] Univ Hosp Geneva, Clin Neurol, Dept Clin Neurosci, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Luescher, Christian; Jabaudon, Denis] Univ Geneva, Inst Genet & Genom Geneva IGE3, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13390,Article,1476-4687,denis.jabaudon@unige.ch,+,Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [PP00P3_123447]; Leenaards Foundation; Synapsis Foundation; NARSAD Foundation; Ambizione grant from the SNF; Gertrude von Meissner Foundation; SNF; Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI); SNF [31003A-135631]; EMBO; International Foundation for Research in Paraplegia; Hans Wilsdorf Foundation,"We thank S.

35,57,283.0,"The inferior temporal cortex ( IT) of primates is thought to be the final visual area in the ventral stream of cortical areas responsible for object recognition(1,2). Consistent with this hypothesis, single IT neurons respond selectively to highly complex visual stimuli such as faces(3-6). However, a direct causal link between the activity of face- selective neurons and face perception has not been demonstrated. In the present study of macaque monkeys, we artificially activated small clusters of IT neurons by means of electrical microstimulation while the monkeys performed a categorization task, judging whether noisy visual images belonged to ' face ' or ' non- face' categories. Here we show that microstimulation of face-selective sites, but not other sites, strongly biased the monkeys' decisions towards the face category. The magnitude of the effect depended upon the degree of face selectivity of the stimulation site, the size of the stimulated cluster of face- selective neurons, and the exact timing of microstimulation. Our results establish a causal relationship between the activity of face- selective neurons and face perception.","Afraz, Seyed-Reza; Kiani, Roozbeh; Esteky, Hossein","Afraz, SR; Kiani, R; Esteky, H",692.0,"Inst Studies Theoret Phys & Math, Sch Cognit Sci, Tehran 19395, Iran; Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Res Ctr Brain & Cognit Sci, Tehran 19385, Iran; Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Neurosci Res Ctr, Tehran 19385, Iran",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature04982,Article,,esteky@ipm.ir,695,,,071UU,,,TEMPORAL VISUAL-CORTEX; PYRAMIDAL TRACT CELLS; INTRACORTICAL MICROSTIMULATION; ELECTRICAL MICROSTIMULATION; SINGLE NEURONS; AREA MT; MACAQUE; RESPONSES; DIRECTION; MONKEY,7103.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",10-Aug,4.0,LONDON,16878143.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,,"Esteky, H (reprint author), Inst Studies Theoret Phys & Math, Sch Cognit Sci, Tehran 19395, Iran.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,143.0,Microstimulation of inferotemporal cortex influences face categorization,0.0,9.0,WOS:000239630200047,283.0,442,Multidisciplinary Sciences,146,hossein,esteky,1691.0,41,male,0.98,vDnQD4sAAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
36,102,110.0,"To resolve the mechanisms that switch competition to cooperation is key to understanding biological organization(1). This is particularly relevant for intrasexual competition, which often leads to males harming females(2). Recent theory proposes that kin selection may modulate female harm by relaxing competition among male relatives(3-5). Here we experimentally manipulate the relatedness of groups of male Drosophila melanogaster competing over females to demonstrate that, as expected, within-group relatedness inhibits male competition and female harm. Females exposed to groups of three brothers unrelated to the female had higher lifetime reproductive success and slower reproductive ageing compared to females exposed to groups of three males unrelated to each other. Triplets of brothers also fought less with each other, courted females less intensively and lived longer than triplets of unrelated males. However, associations among brothers may be vulnerable to invasion by minorities of unrelated males: when two brothers were matched with an unrelated male, the unrelated male sired on average twice as many offspring as either brother. These results demonstrate that relatedness can profoundly affect fitness through its modulation of intrasexual competition, as flies plastically adjust sexual behaviour in a manner consistent with kin-selection theory.","Carazo, Pau; Tan, Cedric K.

37,130,179.0,"It is assumed(1-3) that the radioactive decay of Ti-44 powers the infrared, optical and ultraviolet emission of supernova remnants after the complete decay of Co-56 and Co-57 (the isotopes that dominated the energy balance during the first three to four years after the explosion) until the beginning of active interaction of the ejecta with the surrounding matter. Simulations(4,5) show that the initial mass of Ti-44 synthesized in core-collapse supernovae is (0.02-2.5) x 10(-4) solar masses (M-circle dot). Hard X-rays and gamma-rays from the decay of this Ti-44 have been unambiguously observed from Cassiopeia A only(6-8), leading to the suggestion that values of the initial mass of Ti-44 near the upper bound of the predictions occur only in exceptional cases(9). For the remnant of supernova 1987A(10,11), an upper limit to the initial mass of Ti-44 of <10(-3)M(circle dot) has been obtained from direct X-ray observations(12), and an estimate of (1-2) x 10(-4)M(circle dot) has been made from infrared light curves and ultraviolet spectra by complex and model-dependent computations(13-15). Here we report observations of hard X-rays from the remnant of supernova 1987A in the narrow band containing two direct-escape lines of Ti-44 at 67.9 and 78.4 keV. The measured line fluxes imply that this decay provided sufficient energy to power the remnant at late times. We estimate that the initial mass of Ti-44 was (3.1 +/- 0.8) x 10(-4)M(circle dot), which is near the upper bound of theoretical predictions.","Grebenev, S. A.; Lutovinov, A. A.; Tsygankov, S.

38,41,117.0,"Gamma- ray line radiation at 511 keV is the signature of electron positron annihilation. Such radiation has been known for 30 years to come from the general direction of the Galactic Centre(1), but the origin of the positrons has remained a mystery. Stellar nucleosynthesis(2-4), accreting compact objects(5-8), and even the annihilation of exotic dark- matter particles(9) have all been suggested. Here we report a distinct asymmetry in the 511- keV line emission coming from the inner Galactic disk ( similar to 10-50 degrees from the Galactic Centre). This asymmetry resembles an asymmetry in the distribution of low mass X- ray binaries with strong emission at photon energies >20 keV ('hard' LMXBs), indicating that they may be the dominant origin of the positrons. Although it had long been suspected that electron - positron pair plasmas may exist in X- ray binaries, it was not evident that many of the positrons could escape to lose energy and ultimately annihilate with electrons in the interstellar medium and thus lead to the emission of a narrow 511- keV line. For these models, our result implies that up to a few times 10(41) positrons escape per second from a typical hard LMXB. Positron production at this level from hard LMXBs in the Galactic bulge would reduce ( and possibly eliminate) the need for more exotic explanations, such as those involving dark matter.","Weidenspointner, Georg; Skinner, Gerry; Jean, Pierre; Knoedlseder, Juergen; von Ballmoos, Peter; Bignami, Giovanni; Diehl, Roland; Strong, Andrew W.; Cordier, Bertrand; Schanne, Stephane; Winkler, Christoph","Weidenspointner, G; Skinner, G; Jean, P; Knodlseder, J; von Ballmoos, P; Bignami, G; Diehl, R; Strong, AW; Cordier, B; Schanne, S; Winkler, C",159.0,"[Weidenspointner, Georg; Skinner, Gerry; Jean, Pierre; Knoedlseder, Juergen; von Ballmoos, Peter; Bignami, Giovanni] UPS, CNRS, Ctr Etud Spatiale Rayonnements, Toulouse 4, France; [Weidenspointner, Georg; Diehl, Roland; Strong, Andrew W.] Max Planck Inst Extraterr Phys, D-85741 Garching, Germany; [Weidenspointner, Georg] MPI Halbleiterlab, D-81739 Munich, Germany; [Skinner, Gerry] NASA, CRESST, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Skinner, Gerry] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Skinner, Gerry] Univ Maryland, Dept Astron, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Cordier, Bertrand; Schanne, Stephane] CEA Saclay, SAp, DAPNIA, DSM, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Winkler, Christoph] ESA, ESTEC, SCI SA, NL-2201 AZ Noordwijk, Netherlands; [Bignami, Giovanni] IUSS, I-27100 Pavia, Italy",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06490,Article,,Georg.Weidenspointner@hll.mpg.de,162,,,249GA,,,ANNIHILATION RADIATION; SKY DISTRIBUTION; INNER GALAXY; BLACK-HOLE; MILKY-WAY; EMISSION; AL-26; SEARCH,7175.0,NATURE,Nature,English,29.0,No,"Bignami, Giovanni/0000-0001-9582-2450","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",10-Jan,4.0,LONDON,18185581.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,,"Weidenspointner, G (reprint author), UPS, CNRS, Ctr Etud Spatiale Rayonnements, BP 44346, Toulouse 4, France.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,127.0,An asymmetric distribution of positrons in the Galactic disk revealed by gamma-rays,0.0,4.0,WOS:000252214400035,117.0,451,Multidisciplinary Sciences,127,christoph,winkler,3976.0,192,male,1.0,HIF10V0AAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
39,133,222.0,"Pregnancy is an intricately orchestrated process where immune effector cells with fetal specificity are selectively silenced. This requires the sustained expansion of immune-suppressive maternal FOXP3(+) regulatory T cells (T-reg cells), because even transient partial ablation triggers fetal-specific effector T-cell activation and pregnancy loss(1,2). In turn, many idiopathic pregnancy complications proposed to originate from disrupted fetal tolerance are associated with blunted maternal T-reg expansion(3-5). Importantly, however, the antigen specificity and cellular origin of maternal Treg cells that accumulate during gestation remain incompletely defined. Here we show that pregnancy selectively stimulates the accumulation of maternal FOXP3(+) CD4 cells with fetal specificity using tetramer-based enrichment that allows the identification of rare endogenous T cells(6). Interestingly, after delivery, fetal-specific T-reg cells persist at elevated levels, maintain tolerance to pre-existing fetal antigen, and rapidly re-accumulate during subsequent pregnancy. The accelerated expansion of T-reg cells during secondary pregnancy was driven almost exclusively by proliferation of fetal-specific FOXP3(+) cells retained from prior pregnancy, whereas induced FOXP3 expression and proliferation of pre-existing FOXP3(+) cells each contribute to T-reg expansion during primary pregnancy. Furthermore, fetal resorption in secondary compared with primary pregnancy becomes more resilient to partial maternal FOXP3(+) cell ablation. Thus, pregnancy imprints FOXP3(+) CD4 cells that sustain protective regulatory memory to fetal antigen. We anticipate that these findings will spark further investigation on maternal regulatory T-cell specificity that unlocks new strategies for improving pregnancy outcomes and novel approaches for therapeutically exploiting T-reg cell memory.","Rowe, Jared H.; Ertelt, James M.; Xin, Lijun; Way, Sing Sing","Rowe, JH; Ertelt, JM; Xin, LJ; Way, SS",102.0,"[Rowe, Jared H.; Ertelt, James M.; Xin, Lijun; Way, Sing Sing] Univ Minnesota, Sch Med, Ctr Infect Dis & Microbiol Translat Res, Ctr Immunol,Dept Pediat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Rowe, Jared H.; Ertelt, James M.; Xin, Lijun; Way, Sing Sing] Univ Minnesota, Sch Med, Ctr Infect Dis & Microbiol Translat Res, Ctr Immunol,Dept Microbiol, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11462,Article,,singsing.way@cchmc.org,U119,"NIH-NIAID [R01AI087830, R01AI100934]; NIH-NIDDK [F30DK084674]; Burroughs Wellcome Fund","We thank M.

40,100,493.0,"Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder is a common malignancy that causes approximately 150,000 deaths per year worldwide. So far, no molecularly targeted agents have been approved for treatment of the disease. As part of The Cancer Genome Atlas project, we report here an integrated analysis of 131 urothelial carcinomasto provide a comprehensive landscape of molecular alterations. There were statistically significant recurrent mutations in 32 genes, including multiple genes involved in cell-cycle regulation, chromatin regulation, and kinase signalling pathways, as well as 9 genes not previously reported as significantly mutated in any cancer. RNA sequencing revealed four expression subtypes, two of which (papillary-like and basal/squamous-like) were also evident in microRNA sequencing and protein data. Whole-genome and RNA sequencing identified recurrent in-frame activating FGFR3-TACC3 fusions and expression or integration of several viruses (including HPV16) that are associated with gene inactivation. Our analyses identified potential therapeutic targets in 69% of the tumours, including 42% with targets in the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase/AKT/mTOR pathway and 45% with targets (including ERBB2) in the RTK/MAPK pathway. Chromatin regulatory genes were more frequently mutated in urothelial carcinoma than in any other common cancer studied so far, indicating the future possibility of targeted therapy for chromatin abnormalities.","Weinstein, John N.; Akbani, Rehan; Broom, Bradley M.; Wang, Wenyi; Verhaak, Roeland G.

41,3,194.0,"The chemotaxis signalling network in Escherichia coli that controls the locomotion of bacteria is a classic model system for signal transduction(1,2). This pathway modulates the behaviour of flagellar motors to propel bacteria towards sources of chemical attractants. Although this system relaxes to a steady state in response to environmental changes, the signalling events within the chemotaxis network are noisy and cause large temporal variations of the motor behaviour even in the absence of stimulus(3). That the same signalling network governs both behavioural variability and cellular response raises the question of whether these two traits are independent. Here, we experimentally establish a fluctuation-response relationship in the chemotaxis system of living bacteria. Using this relationship, we demonstrate the possibility of inferring the cellular response from the behavioural variability measured before stimulus. In monitoring the pre- and post-stimulus switching behaviour of individual bacterial motors, we found that variability scales linearly with the response time for different functioning states of the cell. This study highlights that the fundamental relationship between fluctuation and response is not constrained to physical systems at thermodynamic equilibrium(4) but is extensible to living cells(5). Such a relationship not only implies that behavioural variability and cellular response can be coupled traits, but it also provides a general framework within which we can examine how the selection of a network design shapes this interdependence.","Park, Heungwon; Pontius, William; Guet, Calin C.; Marko, John F.; Emonet, Thierry; Cluzel, Philippe","Park, H; Pontius, W; Guet, CC; Marko, JF; Emonet, T; Cluzel, P",819.0,"[Guet, Calin C.; Cluzel, Philippe] Harvard Univ, FAS Ctr Syst Biol, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Guet, Calin C.; Cluzel, Philippe] Harvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Park, Heungwon] Univ Chicago, James Franck Inst, Inst Biophys Dynam, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Park, Heungwon] Univ Chicago, Dept Phys, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Pontius, William; Emonet, Thierry] Yale Univ, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Pontius, William; Emonet, Thierry] Yale Univ, Dept Phys, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Marko, John F.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Mol Biosci, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Marko, John F.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09551,Article,,cluzel@mcb.harvard.edu,U114,"NSF DMR [0213745]; NIH [R01AI059195-03, 1U54CA143869-01]; NSF [CCF0829836, PHY-0852130, DMR-0715099]; Alfred P.

42,30,268.0,"Saturn's narrow F ring exhibits several unusual features that vary on timescales of hours to years. These include transient clumps, a central core surrounded by a multistranded structure and a regular series of longitudinal channels associated with Prometheus, one of the ring's two 'shepherding' satellites. Several smaller moonlets and clumps have been detected in the ring's immediate vicinity, and a population of embedded objects has been inferred. Here we report direct evidence of moonlets embedded in the ring's bright core, and show that most of the F ring's morphology results from the continual gravitational and collisional effects of small satellites, often combined with the perturbing effect of Prometheus. The F- ring region is perhaps the only location in the Solar System where large- scale collisional processes are occurring on an almost daily basis.","Murray, Carl D.; Beurle, Kevin; Cooper, Nicholas J.; Evans, Michael W.; Williams, Gareth A.; Charnoz, Sebastien","Murray, CD; Beurle, K; Cooper, NJ; Evans, MW; Williams, GA; Charnoz, S",739.0,"[Murray, Carl D.; Beurle, Kevin; Cooper, Nicholas J.; Evans, Michael W.; Williams, Gareth A.] Univ London Queen Mary Coll, Astron Unit, London E1 4NS, England; [Charnoz, Sebastien] Univ Paris 07, CE Saclay, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06999,Article,,c.d.murray@qmul.ac.uk,744,,,308UK,,,CASSINI IMAGING SCIENCE; RADIO OCCULTATION; SMALL SATELLITES; ECCENTRICITY; PROMETHEUS; VOYAGER-2; ORBITS,7196.0,NATURE,Nature,English,26.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",5-Jun,6.0,LONDON,18528389.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,,"Murray, CD (reprint author), Univ London Queen Mary Coll, Astron Unit, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,47.0,The determination of the structure of Saturn's F ring by nearby moonlets,1.0,6.0,WOS:000256415300034,268.0,453,Multidisciplinary Sciences,47,sebastien,charnoz,2509.0,112,male,1.0,T3F2uwsAAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",6275891,1,1430996,1,Sébastien Charnoz,Sébastien Charnoz,1,1
43,98,461.0,"Increases in brain blood flow, evoked by neuronal activity, power neural computation and form the basis of BOLD(blood-oxygen-level-dependent) functional imaging. Whether blood flow is controlled solely by arteriole smooth muscle, or also by capillary pericytes, is controversial. We demonstrate that neuronal activity and the neurotransmitter glutamate evoke the release of messengers that dilate capillaries by actively relaxing pericytes. Dilation is mediated by prostaglandin E-2, but requires nitric oxide release to suppress vasoconstricting 20-HETE synthesis. In vivo, when sensory input increases blood flow, capillaries dilate before arterioles and are estimated to produce 84% of the blood flow increase. In pathology, ischaemia evokes capillary constriction by pericytes. We show that this is followed by pericyte death in rigor, which may irreversibly constrict capillaries and damage the blood-brain barrier. Thus, pericytes are major regulators of cerebral blood flow and initiators of functional imaging signals. Prevention of pericyte constriction and death may reduce the long-lasting blood flow decrease that damages neurons after stroke.","Hall, Catherine N.; Reynell, Clare; Gesslein, Bodil; Hamilton, Nicola B.; Mishra, Anusha; Sutherland, Brad A.; O'Farrell, Fergus M.; Buchan, Alastair M.; Lauritzen, Martin; Attwell, David","Hall, CN; Reynell, C; Gesslein, B; Hamilton, NB; Mishra, A; Sutherland, BA; O'Farrell, FM; Buchan, AM; Lauritzen, M; Attwell, D",55.0,"[Hall, Catherine N.; Reynell, Clare; Hamilton, Nicola B.; Mishra, Anusha; O'Farrell, Fergus M.; Attwell, David] UCL, Dept Neurosci Physiol & Pharmacol, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Gesslein, Bodil; Lauritzen, Martin] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Neurosci & Pharmacol, DK-2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark; [Gesslein, Bodil; Lauritzen, Martin] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Hlth Aging, DK-2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark; [Sutherland, Brad A.; Buchan, Alastair M.] Univ Oxford, Radcliffe Dept Med, Acute Stroke Programme, Oxford OX3 9DU, England; [Lauritzen, Martin] Glostrup Univ Hosp, Dept Clin Neurophysiol, DK-2600 Glostrup, Denmark",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13165,Article,1476-4687,mlauritz@sund.ku.dk; d.attwell@ucl.ac.uk,+,Fondation Leducq; European Research Council; Wellcome Trust; UK Medical Research Council; Rosetrees Trust; Nordea Foundation via the Center for Healthy Aging; Lundbeck Foundation; NOVO-Nordisk Foundation; Danish Medical Research Council,"We thank B.

44,119,154.0,"Human language, as well as birdsong, relies on the ability to arrange vocal elements in new sequences. However, little is known about the ontogenetic origin of this capacity. Here we track the development of vocal combinatorial capacity in three species of vocal learners, combining an experimental approach in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) with an analysis of natural development of vocal transitions in Bengalese finches (Lonchura striata domestica) and pre-lingual human infants. We find a common, stepwise pattern of acquiring vocal transitions across species. In our first study, juvenile zebra finches were trained to perform one song and then the training target was altered, prompting the birds to swap syllable order, or insert a new syllable into a string. All birds solved these permutation tasks in a series of steps, gradually approximating the target sequence by acquiring new pairwise syllable transitions, sometimes too slowly to accomplish the task fully. Similarly, in the more complex songs of Bengalese finches, branching points and bidirectional transitions in song syntax were acquired in a stepwise fashion, starting from a more restrictive set of vocal transitions. The babbling of pre-lingual human infants showed a similar pattern: instead of a single developmental shift from reduplicated to variegated babbling (that is, from repetitive to diverse sequences), we observed multiple shifts, where each new syllable type slowly acquired a diversity of pairwise transitions, asynchronously over development. Collectively, these results point to a common generative process that is conserved across species, suggesting that the long-noted gap between perceptual versus motor combinatorial capabilities in human infants(1) may arise partly from the challenges in constructing new pairwise vocal transitions.","Lipkind, Dina; Marcus, Gary F.; Bemis, Douglas K.; Sasahara, Kazutoshi; Jacoby, Nori; Takahasi, Miki; Suzuki, Kenta; Feher, Olga; Ravbar, Primoz; Okanoya, Kazuo; Tchernichovski, Ofer","Lipkind, D; Marcus, GF; Bemis, DK; Sasahara, K; Jacoby, N; Takahasi, M; Suzuki, K; Feher, O; Ravbar, P; Okanoya, K; Tchernichovski, O",104.0,"[Lipkind, Dina; Feher, Olga; Tchernichovski, Ofer] CUNY Hunter Coll, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Lipkind, Dina; Feher, Olga; Ravbar, Primoz; Tchernichovski, Ofer] CUNY City Coll, Dept Biol, New York, NY 10031 USA; [Marcus, Gary F.; Bemis, Douglas K.] NYU, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Sasahara, Kazutoshi; Takahasi, Miki; Suzuki, Kenta; Okanoya, Kazuo] RIKEN Brain Sci Inst, Lab Biolinguist, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Jacoby, Nori] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Interdisciplinary Ctr Neural Computat, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel; [Jacoby, Nori] Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Mus, IL-5290002 Ramat Gan, Israel; [Suzuki, Kenta; Okanoya, Kazuo] JST ERATO Okanoya Emot Informat Project, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Feher, Olga; Ravbar, Primoz; Tchernichovski, Ofer] CUNY, Grad Ctr, New York, NY 10016 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12173,Article,,dina.lipkind@gmail.com,+,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan; US Public Health Service grant","We thank J.

45,78,431.0,"The tumour microenvironment may contribute to tumorigenesis owing to mechanical forces such as fibrotic stiffness or mechanical pressure caused by the expansion of hyper-proliferative cells(1,2). Here we explore the contribution of the mechanical pressure exerted by tumour growth onto non-tumorous adjacent epithelium. In the early stage of mouse colon tumour development in the Notch(+)Apc(+/1638N) mouse model, we observed mechanistic pressure stress in the non-tumorous epithelial cells caused by hyper-proliferative adjacent crypts overexpressing active Notch, which is associated with increased Ret and beta-catenin signalling. We thus developed a method that allows the delivery of a defined mechanical pressure in vivo, by subcutaneously inserting a magnet close to the mouse colon. The implanted magnet generated a magnetic force on ultra-magnetic liposomes, stabilized in the mesenchymal cells of the connective tissue surrounding colonic crypts after intravenous injection. The magnetically induced pressure quantitatively mimicked the endogenous early tumour growth stress in the order of 1,200 Pa, without affecting tissue stiffness, as monitored by ultrasound strain imaging and shear wave elastography. The exertion of pressure mimicking that of tumour growth led to rapid Ret activation and downstream phosphorylation of beta-catenin on Tyr654, imparing its interaction with the E-cadherin in adherens junctions, and which was followed by beta-catenin nuclear translocation after 15 days. As a consequence, increased expression of beta-catenin-target genes was observed at 1 month, together with crypt enlargement accompanying the formation of early tumorous aberrant crypt foci. Mechanical activation of the tumorigenic beta-catenin pathway suggests unexplored modes of tumour propagation based on mechanical signalling pathways in healthy epithelial cells surrounding the tumour, which may contribute to tumour heterogeneity.","Fernandez-Sanchez, Maria Elena; Barbier, Sandrine; Whitehead, Joanne; Bealle, Gaelle; Michel, Aude; Latorre-Ossa, Heldmuth; Rey, Colette; Fouassier, Laura; Claperon, Audrey; Brulle, Laura; Girard, Elodie; Servant, Nicolas; Rio-Frio, Thomas; Marie, Helene; Lesieur, Sylviane; Housset, Chantal; Gennisson, Jean-Luc; Tanter, Mickael; Menager, Christine; Fre, Silvia; Robine, Sylvie; Farge, Emmanuel","Fernandez-Sanchez, ME; Barbier, S; Whitehead, J; Bealle, G; Michel, A; Latorre-Ossa, H; Rey, C; Fouassier, L; Claperon, A; Brulle, L; Girard, E; Servant, N; Rio-Frio, T; Marie, H; Lesieur, S; Housset, C; Gennisson, JL; Tanter, M; Menager, C; Fre, S; Robine, S; Farge, E",92.0,"[Fernandez-Sanchez, Maria Elena; Barbier, Sandrine; Whitehead, Joanne; Farge, Emmanuel] PSL Res Univ, Fdn Pierre Gilles Gennes, CNRS UMR Physicochim Curie Mech & Genet Embryon &, Inst Curie,Ctr Rech,INSERM, F-75005 Paris, France; [Bealle, Gaelle; Michel, Aude; Menager, Christine] Univ Paris 04, UPMC, Lab PHENIX Physicochim Electrolytes & Nanosyst In, CNRS UMR 8234, F-75005 Paris, France; [Latorre-Ossa, Heldmuth; Gennisson, Jean-Luc; Tanter, Mickael] PSL Res Univ, Waves & Images ESPCI ParisTech, Langevin Inst, CNRS UMR7587,Inserm U979, F-75005 Paris, France; [Rey, Colette; Fouassier, Laura; Claperon, Audrey; Housset, Chantal] Univ Paris 04, UPMC, F-75012 Paris, France; [Rey, Colette; Fouassier, Laura; Claperon, Audrey; Housset, Chantal] INSERM, UMR S 938, CDR St Antoine, F-75012 Paris, France; [Brulle, Laura] Inst Curie, Ctr Rech, CNRS UMR3666, INSERM Endocyt Trafficking & Therapeut Delivery U, F-75005 Paris, France; [Girard, Elodie; Servant, Nicolas] Inst Curie, MINES ParisTech, Bioinformat Platform, U900, F-75005 Paris, France; [Rio-Frio, Thomas] Inst Curie, Next Generat Sequencing Platform, F-75005 Paris, France; [Marie, Helene; Lesieur, Sylviane] Univ Paris 11, Lab Physicochim Syst Polyphases, Fac Pharm, CNRS UMR 8612,Inst Galien Paris Sud,LabEx LERMIT, F-92296 Chatenay Malabry, France; [Fre, Silvia] Inst Curie, Unite Genet & Biol Dev, Notch Signaling Stem Cells & Tumors, CNRS UMR 3215,INSERM U934,Ctr Rech, F-75005 Paris, France; [Robine, Sylvie] Inst Curie, Ctr Rech, CNRS Compartimentat & Dynam Cellulaires Morphogen, F-75005 Paris, France",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14329,Article,1476-4687,efarge@curie.fr,+,"CNRS; INSERM; ARC [5030, 29324]; ANR [09PIRI0013-01, 11 BSV5014-01]; Labex CelTisPhyBio [11-LBX-0038]; Fonds CSP; Fondation Pierre-Gille de Gennes; Fondation de France; Inca [PLBIO13-172]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (investissements d'avenir) [ANR-10-EQPX-03, ANR10-INBS-09-08]; Canceropole Ile-de-France","This research was funded by the CNRS, INSERM, ARC (grant no.s 5030 and 29324), ANR (grant no.s 09PIRI0013-01 and 11 BSV5014-01), the Labex CelTisPhyBio (grant no. 11-LBX-0038), Fonds CSP, Fondation Pierre-Gille de Gennes, Fondation de France and the Inca (grant no.

46,140,201.0,"In 1961, Rolf Landauer argued that the erasure of information is a dissipative process(1). A minimal quantity of heat, proportional to the thermal energy and called the Landauer bound, is necessarily produced when a classical bit of information is deleted. A direct consequence of this logically irreversible transformation is that the entropy of the environment increases by a finite amount. Despite its fundamental importance for information theory and computer science(2-5), the erasure principle has not been verified experimentally so far, the main obstacle being the difficulty of doing single-particle experiments in the low-dissipation regime. Here we experimentally show the existence of the Landauer bound in a generic model of a one-bit memory. Using a system of a single colloidal particle trapped in a modulated double-well potential, we establish that the mean dissipated heat saturates at the Landauer bound in the limit of long erasure cycles. This result demonstrates the intimate link between information theory and thermodynamics. It further highlights the ultimate physical limit of irreversible computation.","Berut, Antoine; Arakelyan, Artak; Petrosyan, Artyom; Ciliberto, Sergio; Dillenschneider, Raoul; Lutz, Eric","Berut, A; Arakelyan, A; Petrosyan, A; Ciliberto, S; Dillenschneider, R; Lutz, E",187.0,"[Berut, Antoine; Arakelyan, Artak; Petrosyan, Artyom; Ciliberto, Sergio] Ecole Normale Super Lyon, Phys Lab, CNRS, UMR5672, F-69364 Lyon, France; [Dillenschneider, Raoul] Univ Kaiserslautern, Dept Phys, D-67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany; [Dillenschneider, Raoul] Univ Kaiserslautern, Res Ctr OPTIMAS, D-67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany; [Lutz, Eric] Univ Augsburg, Dept Phys, D-86135 Augsburg, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10872,Article,,eric.lutz@fu-berlin.de,U1500,"DFG [LU1382/1-1]; Cluster of Excellence Nanosystems Initiative Munich (NIM), DAAD; Research Center of the DFG [Transregio 49]","This work was supported by the Emmy Noether Program of the DFG (contract no.

47,49,128.0,"Neural activity increases local blood flow in the central nervous system (CNS), which is the basis of BOLD (blood oxygen level dependent) and PET (positron emission tomography) functional imaging techniques(1-3). Blood flow is assumed to be regulated by precapillary arterioles, because capillaries lack smooth muscle. However, most (65%) noradrenergic innervation of CNS blood vessels terminates near capillaries rather than arterioles(4), and in muscle and brain a dilatory signal propagates from vessels near metabolically active cells to precapillary arterioles(5,6), suggesting that blood flow control is initiated in capillaries. Pericytes, which are apposed to CNS capillaries and contain contractile proteins(7), could initiate such signalling. Here we show that pericytes can control capillary diameter in whole retina and cerebellar slices. Electrical stimulation of retinal pericytes evoked a localized capillary constriction, which propagated at similar to 2 mu m s(-1) to constrict distant pericytes. Superfused ATP in retina or noradrenaline in cerebellum resulted in constriction of capillaries by pericytes, and glutamate reversed the constriction produced by noradrenaline. Electrical stimulation or puffing GABA (gamma-amino butyric acid) receptor blockers in the inner retina also evoked pericyte constriction. In simulated ischaemia, some pericytes constricted capillaries. Pericytes are probably modulators of blood flow in response to changes in neural activity, which may contribute to functional imaging signals and to CNS vascular disease.","Peppiatt, Claire M.; Howarth, Clare; Mobbs, Peter; Attwell, David","Peppiatt, CM; Howarth, C; Mobbs, P; Attwell, D",700.0,"UCL, Dept Physiol, London WC1E 6BT, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature05193,Article,,D.Attwell@ucl.ac.uk,704,"Wellcome Trust [, 017948, 075232]",,093HX,,,RAT RETINA; CONTAINING MICROVASCULATURE; BLOOD-FLOW; IN-VIVO; BRAIN; CALCIUM; MUSCLE; CORTEX; CELLS,7112.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,"Peppiatt-Wildman, Claire/0000-0002-4406-8571","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",12-Oct,5.0,LONDON,17036005.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,,"Attwell, D (reprint author), UCL, Dept Physiol, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,437.0,Bidirectional control of CNS capillary diameter by pericytes,7.0,50.0,WOS:000241160500048,128.0,443,Multidisciplinary Sciences,455,david,attwell,2398.0,12593,male,1.0,PpRdCfQAAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",33588185,1,1804463,1,David Attwell,David Attwell,1,1

Including this new taxon in a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis for basal Paraves does the following: (1) it recovers it as the basal-most avialan; (2) it confirms the avialan status of Archaeopteryx; (3) it places Troodontidae as the sister-group to Avialae; (4) it supports a single origin of powered flight within Paraves; and (5) it implies that the early diversification of Paraves and Avialae took place in the Middle-Late Jurassic period.","Godefroit, Pascal; Cau, Andrea; Hu Dong-Yu; Escuillie, Franois; Wu Wenhao; Dyke, Gareth","Godefroit, P; Cau, A; Hu, DY; Escuillie, F; Wu, WH; Dyke, G",359.0,"[Godefroit, Pascal] Royal Belgian Inst Nat Sci, Operat Direct Earth & Hist Life, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [Cau, Andrea] Museo Geol Giovanni Capellini, I-40127 Bologna, Italy; [Hu Dong-Yu] Shenyang Normal Univ, Inst Paleontol, Shenyang 110034, Peoples R China; [Hu Dong-Yu] NE Normal Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Vegetat Ecol, Changchun 130024, Peoples R China; [Escuillie, Franois] Eldonia, F-3800 Gannat, France; [Wu Wenhao] Jilin Univ, Res Ctr Paleontol & Stratig, Changchun 130021, Peoples R China; [Dyke, Gareth] Univ Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12168,Article,,Pascal.Godefroit@naturalsciences.be,362,SPP Politique scientifique (Belgium) [BL/36/62]; Key Laboratory of Evolutionary Systematics of Vertebrates [CAS2011LESV011]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41172026],"We thank B.

49,61,425.0,"Periodic somite segmentation in vertebrate embryos is controlled by the 'segmentation clock', which consists of numerous cellular oscillators. Although the properties of a single oscillator, driven by a hairy negative-feedback loop, have been investigated, the system-level properties of the segmentation clock remain largely unknown. To explore these characteristics, we have examined the response of a normally oscillating clock in zebrafish to experimental stimuli using in vivo mosaic experiments and mathematical simulation. We demonstrate that the segmentation clock behaves as a coupled oscillator, by showing that Notch-dependent intercellular communication, the activity of which is regulated by the internal hairy oscillator, couples neighbouring cells to facilitate synchronized oscillation. Furthermore, the oscillation phase of individual oscillators fluctuates due to developmental noise such as stochastic gene expression and active cell proliferation. The intercellular coupling was found to have a crucial role in minimizing the effects of this noise to maintain coherent oscillation.","Horikawa, Kazuki; Ishimatsu, Kana; Yoshimoto, Eiichi; Kondo, Shigeru; Takeda, Hiroyuki","Horikawa, K; Ishimatsu, K; Yoshimoto, E; Kondo, S; Takeda, H",719.0,"Univ Tokyo, Dept Biol Sci, Grad Sch Sci, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; Nagoya Univ, Div Biol Sci, Grad Sch Sci, Nagoya, Aichi 4648602, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature04861,Article,,kazu@biol.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp; htakeda@biol.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp,723,,,050NL,,,SOMITE SEGMENTATION; GENE-EXPRESSION; ZEBRAFISH SOMITOGENESIS; LUNATIC-FRINGE; VERTEBRATE SEGMENTATION; INDIVIDUAL FIBROBLASTS; MECHANISM; NETWORK; CELLS; HER1,7094.0,NATURE,Nature,English,44.0,No,"Horikawa, Kazuki/0000-0002-9285-4171","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",8-Jun,5.0,LONDON,16760970.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,"TAKEDA, HIROYUKI/G-4950-2014","Horikawa, K (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Dept Biol Sci, Grad Sch Sci, Hongo 7-3-1, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,161.0,Noise-resistant and synchronized oscillation of the segmentation clock,0.0,16.0,WOS:000238095100046,425.0,441,Multidisciplinary Sciences,166,hiroyuki,takeda,2324.0,29,male,1.0,91YDSugAAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",30108719,1,39665835,1,Hiroyuki Takeda,Hiroyuki Takeda,1,1
50,125,469.0,"High He-3/He-4 ratios in some basalts have generally been interpreted as originating in an incompletely degassed lower-mantle source(1-9). This helium source may have been isolated at the core-mantle boundary region since Earth's accretion(4-6). Alternatively, it may have taken part in whole-mantle convection and crust production over the age of the Earth(7-9); if so, it is now either a primitive refugium at the core-mantle boundary(8) or is distributed throughout the lower mantle(7,9). Here we constrain the problem using lavas from Baffin Island, West Greenland, the Ontong Java Plateau, Isla Gorgona and Fernandina (Galapagos). Olivine phenocryst compositions show that these lavas originated from a peridotite source that was about 20 per cent higher in nickel content than in the modern mid-ocean-ridge basalt source. Where data are available, these lavas also have high He-3/He-4. We propose that a less-degassed nickel-rich source formed by core-mantle interaction during the crystallization of a melt-rich layer or basal magma ocean(5,6), and that this source continues to be sampled by mantle plumes. The spatial distribution of this source may be constrained by nickel partitioning experiments at the pressures of the core-mantle boundary.","Herzberg, Claude; Asimow, Paul D.; Ionov, Dmitri A.; Vidito, Chris; Jackson, Matthew G.; Geist, Dennis","Herzberg, C; Asimow, PD; Ionov, DA; Vidito, C; Jackson, MG; Geist, D",393.0,"[Herzberg, Claude; Vidito, Chris] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; [Asimow, Paul D.] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Ionov, Dmitri A.] Univ St Etienne, Dept Geol, F-42023 St Etienne 2, France; [Ionov, Dmitri A.] CNRS, UMR 6524, Lab Magmas & Volcans, F-42023 St Etienne, France; [Jackson, Matthew G.] Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Geist, Dennis] Univ Idaho, Dept Geol Sci, Moscow, ID 83844 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11771,Article,1476-4687,herzberg@rci.rutgers.edu,U134,"French INSU-CNRS; NSF [EAR-1119522, EAR1145271]","C.H. thanks L.

Our studies reveal the spatial arrangement of ubiquitin receptors, deubiquitinating enzymes and the protein unfolding machinery at subnanometre resolution, outlining the substrate's path to degradation. Unexpectedly, the ATPase subunits within the base unfoldase are arranged in a spiral staircase, providing insight into potential mechanisms for substrate translocation through the central pore. Large conformational rearrangements of the lid upon holoenzyme formation suggest allosteric regulation of deubiquitination.

52,154,179.0,"About one-third of the carbon dioxide (CO(2)) released into the atmosphere as a result of human activity has been absorbed by the oceans(1), where it partitions into the constituent ions of carbonic acid. This leads to ocean acidification, one of the major threats to marine ecosystems(2) and particularly to calcifying organisms such as corals(3,4), foraminifera(5-7) and coccolithophores(8). Coccolithophores are abundant phytoplankton that are responsible for a large part of modern oceanic carbonate production. Culture experiments investigating the physiological response of coccolithophore calcification to increased CO(2) have yielded contradictory results between and even within species(8-11). Here we quantified the calcite mass of dominant coccolithophores in the present ocean and over the past forty thousand years, and found a marked pattern of decreasing calcification with increasing partial pressure of CO(2) and concomitant decreasing concentrations of CO(3)(2-). Our analyses revealed that differentially calcified species and morphotypes are distributed in the ocean according to carbonate chemistry.

53,153,126.0,"DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in repetitive sequences are a potent source of genomic instability, owing to the possibility of non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR). Repetitive sequences are especially at risk during meiosis, when numerous programmed DSBs are introduced into the genome to initiate meiotic recombination(1). In the repetitive ribosomal DNA (rDNA) array of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, meiotic DSB formation is prevented in part through Sir2-dependent heterochromatin formation(2,3). Here we show that the edges of the rDNA array are exceptionally susceptible to meiotic DSBs, revealing an inherent heterogeneity in the rDNA array. We find that this localized DSB susceptibility necessitates a border-specific protection system consisting of the meiotic ATPase Pch2 and the origin recognition complex subunit Orc1. Upon disruption of these factors, DSB formation and recombination increased specifically in the outermost rDNA repeats, leading to NAHR and rDNA instability. Notably, the Sir2-dependent heterochromatin of the rDNA itself was responsible for the induction of DSBs at the rDNA borders in pch2 Delta cells. Thus, although the activity of Sir2 globally prevents meiotic DSBs in the rDNA, it creates a highly permissive environment for DSB formation at the junctions between heterochromatin and euchromatin. Heterochromatinized repetitive DNA arrays are abundant in most eukaryotic genomes. Our data define the borders of such chromatin domains as distinct high-risk regions for meiotic NAHR, the protection of which may be a universal requirement to prevent meiotic genome rearrangements that are associated with genomic diseases and birth defects.","Vader, Gerben; Blitzblau, Hannah G.; Tame, Mihoko A.; Falk, Jill E.; Curtin, Lisa; Hochwagen, Andreas","Vader, G; Blitzblau, HG; Tame, MA; Falk, JE; Curtin, L; Hochwagen, A",115.0,"[Vader, Gerben; Blitzblau, Hannah G.; Tame, Mihoko A.; Falk, Jill E.; Curtin, Lisa; Hochwagen, Andreas] Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge Ctr 9, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Curtin, Lisa] Somerville High Sch, Somerville, MA 02143 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10331,Article,,andi@nyu.edu,U141,"NIH [GM088248]; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research [NWO Rubicon-825.08.009, NWO VENI-016.111.004]; HHMI [52005879]","We thank S.

We document an elongate head with a pair of simple eyes, a terminal buccal chamber containing a radial array of sclerotized elements, and a differentiated foregut that is lined with acicular teeth. The radial elements and pharyngeal teeth resemble the sclerotized circumoral elements and pharyngeal teeth expressed in tardigrades(7-9), stem-group euarthropods(10-12) and cycloneuralian worms(13).

55,152,94.0,"Ebola virus (EboV) is a highly pathogenic enveloped virus that causes outbreaks of zoonotic infection in Africa. The clinical symptoms are manifestations of the massive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to infection(1) and in many outbreaks, mortality exceeds 75%. The unpredictable onset, ease of transmission, rapid progression of disease, high mortality and lack of effective vaccine or therapy have created a high level of public concern about EboV(2). Here we report the identification of a novel benzylpiperazine adamantane diamide-derived compound that inhibits EboV infection. Using mutant cell lines and informative derivatives of the lead compound, we show that the target of the inhibitor is the endosomal membrane protein Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1). We find that NPC1 is essential for infection, that it binds to the virus glycoprotein (GP), and that antiviral compounds interfere with GP binding to NPC1. Combined with the results of previous studies of GP structure and function, our findings support a model of EboV infection in which cleavage of the GP1 subunit by endosomal cathepsin proteases removes heavily glycosylated domains to expose the amino-terminal domain(3-7), which is a ligand for NPC1 and regulates membrane fusion by the GP2 subunit(8). Thus, NPC1 is essential for EboV entry and a target for antiviral therapy.","Cote, Marceline; Misasi, John; Ren, Tao; Bruchez, Anna; Lee, Kyungae; Filone, Claire Marie; Hensley, Lisa; Li, Qi; Ory, Daniel; Chandran, Kartik; Cunningham, James","Cote, M; Misasi, J; Ren, T; Bruchez, A; Lee, K; Filone, CM; Hensley, L; Li, Q; Ory, D; Chandran, K; Cunningham, J",344.0,"[Cote, Marceline; Misasi, John; Bruchez, Anna; Filone, Claire Marie; Li, Qi; Chandran, Kartik; Cunningham, James] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Div Hematol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Misasi, John] Childrens Hosp, Dept Med, Div Infect Dis, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Ren, Tao; Lee, Kyungae] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, New England Reg Ctr Excellence Biodefense & Emerg, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Filone, Claire Marie; Hensley, Lisa] USA, Med Res Inst Infect Dis, Div Virol, Frederick, MD 21702 USA; [Ory, Daniel] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Diabet Cardiovasc Dis Ctr, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Cunningham, James] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Boston, MA 02115 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10380,Article,,jcunningham@rics.bwh.harvard.edu,U122,"PIDS-Sanofi-Pasteur Fellowship [K12-HD052896, 5K08AI079381, 5-T32-HL007623]; Fonds de la Recherche en Sante du Quebec; US Army Medical Research and Material Command;  [U54 AI057159];  [R01 CA104266]","We thank B.

56,5,238.0,"Sex determination is a fundamental biological process, yet its mechanisms are remarkably diverse(1,2). In vertebrates, sex can be determined by inherited genetic factors or by the temperature experienced during embryonic development(2,3). However, the evolutionary causes of this diversity remain unknown. Here we show that live-bearing lizards at different climatic extremes of the species' distribution differ in their sex-determining mechanisms, with temperature-dependent sex determination in lowlands and genotypic sex determination in highlands. A theoretical model parameterized with field data accurately predicts this divergence in sex-determining systems and the consequence thereof for variation in cohort sex ratios among years. Furthermore, we show that divergent natural selection on sex determination across altitudes is caused by climatic effects on lizard life history and variation in the magnitude of between-year temperature fluctuations. Our results establish an adaptive explanation for intra-specific divergence in sex-determining systems driven by phenotypic plasticity and ecological selection, thereby providing a unifying framework for integrating the developmental, ecological and evolutionary basis for variation in vertebrate sex determination.","Pen, Ido; Uller, Tobias; Feldmeyer, Barbara; Harts, Anna; While, Geoffrey M.; Wapstra, Erik","Pen, I; Uller, T; Feldmeyer, B; Harts, A; While, GM; Wapstra, E",436.0,"[Pen, Ido; Feldmeyer, Barbara; Harts, Anna] Univ Groningen, Theoret Biol Grp, NL-9750 AA Haren, Netherlands; [Uller, Tobias] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Edward Grey Inst, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [While, Geoffrey M.; Wapstra, Erik] Univ Tasmania, Sch Zool, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09512,Article,,i.r.pen@rug.nl,U262,Australian Research Council [DP0877948]; Hermon Slade Foundation; Wenner-Gren Foundations,"Funding was provided by the Australian Research Council to E.W., T.U. and I.P.

57,110,336.0,"Reprogramming of adult cells to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) has opened new therapeutic opportunities; however, little is known about the possibility of in vivo reprogramming within tissues. Here we show that transitory induction of the four factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc in mice results in teratomas emerging from multiple organs, implying that full reprogramming can occur in vivo. Analyses of the stomach, intestine, pancreas and kidney reveal groups of dedifferentiated cells that express the pluripotency marker NANOG, indicative of in situ reprogramming. By bone marrow transplantation, we demonstrate that haematopoietic cells can also be reprogrammed in vivo. Notably, reprogrammable mice present circulating iPS cells in the blood and, at the transcriptome level, these in vivo generated iPS cells are closer to embryonic stem cells (ES cells) than standard in vitro generated iPS cells. Moreover, in vivo iPS cells efficiently contribute to the trophectoderm lineage, suggesting that they achieve a more plastic or primitive state than ES cells. Finally, intraperitoneal injection of in vivo iPS cells generates embryo-like structures that express embryonic and extraembryonic markers. We conclude that reprogramming in vivo is feasible and confers totipotency features absent in standard iPS or ES cells. These discoveries could be relevant for future applications of reprogramming in regenerative medicine.","Abad, Maria; Mosteiro, Lluc; Pantoja, Cristina; Canamero, Marta; Rayon, Teresa; Ors, Inmaculada; Grana, Osvaldo; Megias, Diego; Dominguez, Orlando; Martinez, Dolores; Manzanares, Miguel; Ortega, Sagrario; Serrano, Manuel","Abad, M; Mosteiro, L; Pantoja, C; Canamero, M; Rayon, T; Ors, I; Grana, O; Megias, D; Dominguez, O; Martinez, D; Manzanares, M; Ortega, S; Serrano, M",340.0,"[Abad, Maria; Mosteiro, Lluc; Pantoja, Cristina; Serrano, Manuel] Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, Tumour Suppress Grp, E-28029 Madrid, Spain; [Canamero, Marta] Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, Histopathol Unit, E-28029 Madrid, Spain; [Rayon, Teresa; Ors, Inmaculada; Manzanares, Miguel] Spanish Natl Cardiovasc Res Ctr CNIC, Cardiovasc Dev & Repair Dept, E-28029 Madrid, Spain; [Grana, Osvaldo] Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, Bioinformat Unit, E-28029 Madrid, Spain; [Megias, Diego] Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, Confocal Microscopy Unit, E-28029 Madrid, Spain; [Dominguez, Orlando] Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, Genom Unit, E-28029 Madrid, Spain; [Martinez, Dolores] Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, Flow Cytometry Unit, E-28029 Madrid, Spain; [Ortega, Sagrario] Spanish Natl Canc Res Ctr CNIO, Transgen Mice Unit, E-28029 Madrid, Spain",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12586,Article,1476-4687,mserrano@cnio.es,+,"CNIO; Spanish Ministry of Economy (MINECO, SAF); Regional Government of Madrid (ReCaRe); European Union (RISK-IR); Botin Foundation; Ramon Areces Foundation; AXA Foundation; MINECO(BFU); Regional Government of Madrid (Cell-DD); ProCNIC Foundation","We are grateful to M.

58,46,332.0,"Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations were significantly lower during glacial periods than during intervening interglacial periods, but the mechanisms responsible for this difference remain uncertain. Many recent explanations call on greater carbon storage in a poorly ventilated deep ocean during glacial periods(1-5), but direct evidence regarding the ventilation and respired carbon content of the glacial deep ocean is sparse and often equivocal(6). Here we present sedimentary geochemical records from sites spanning the deep subarctic Pacific that-together with previously published results(7)-show that a poorly ventilated water mass containing a high concentration of respired carbon dioxide occupied the North Pacific abyss during the Last Glacial Maximum. Despite an inferred increase in deep Southern Ocean ventilation during the first step of the deglaciation (18,000-15,000 years ago)(4,8), we find no evidence for improved ventilation in the abyssal subarctic Pacific until a rapid transition similar to 14,600 years ago: this change was accompanied by an acceleration of export production from the surface waters above but only a small increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration(8). We speculate that these changes were mechanistically linked to a roughly coeval increase in deep water formation in the North Atlantic(9-11), which flushed respired carbon dioxide from northern abyssal waters, but also increased the supply of nutrients to the upper ocean, leading to greater carbon dioxide sequestration at mid-depths and stalling the rise of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. Our findings are qualitatively consistent with hypotheses invoking a deglacial flushing of respired carbon dioxide from an isolated, deep ocean reservoir(1-5,12), but suggest that the reservoir may have been released in stages, as vigorous deep water ventilation switched between North Atlantic and Southern Ocean source regions.","Galbraith, Eric D.; Jaccard, Samuel L.; Pedersen, Thomas F.; Sigman, Daniel M.; Haug, Gerald H.; Cook, Mea; Southon, John R.; Francois, Roger","Galbraith, ED; Jaccard, SL; Pedersen, TF; Sigman, DM; Haug, GH; Cook, M; Southon, JR; Francois, R",890.0,"Univ British Columbia, Dept Earth & Ocean Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; Univ Victoria, Sch Earth & Ocean Sci, Victoria, BC V8W 3P6, Canada; Princeton Univ, Dept Geosci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; ETH, Inst Geol, Dept Earth Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ocean Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06227,Article,,egalbrai@princeton.edu,U9,,,221LY,,,ATMOSPHERIC CO2 CONCENTRATIONS; SANTA-BARBARA BASIN; DEEP-WATER; AGE CALIBRATION; RADIOCARBON AGE; SOUTHERN-OCEAN; GLACIAL PERIOD; PRODUCTIVITY; CIRCULATION; VENTILATION,7164.0,NATURE,Nature,English,39.0,No,"Sigman, Daniel/0000-0002-7923-1973; Galbraith, Eric/0000-0003-4476-4232; Jaccard, Samuel/0000-0002-5793-0896","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",18-Oct,5.0,LONDON,17943127.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007.0,"Sigman, Daniel/A-2649-2008; Galbraith, Eric/F-9469-2014; Jaccard, Samuel/G-3447-2014","Galbraith, ED (reprint author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Earth & Ocean Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,116.0,Carbon dioxide release from the North Pacific abyss during the last deglaciation,1.0,30.0,WOS:000250230600043,332.0,449,Multidisciplinary Sciences,116,roger,francois,3429.0,1220,male,1.0,wa5soqQAAAAJ,2,"(1474, 4126]",19978989,1,33138,1,Roger François,Roger François,0,0
59,126,481.0,"Cellulose, the most abundant biological macromolecule, is an extracellular, linear polymer of glucose molecules. It represents an essential component of plant cell walls but is also found in algae and bacteria. In bacteria, cellulose production frequently correlates with the formation of biofilms, a sessile, multicellular growth form. Cellulose synthesis and transport across the inner bacterial membrane is mediated by a complex of the membrane-integrated catalytic BcsA subunit and the membrane-anchored, periplasmic BcsB protein. Here we present the crystal structure of a complex of BcsA and BcsB from Rhodobacter sphaeroides containing a translocating polysaccharide. The structure of the BcsA-BcsB translocation intermediate reveals the architecture of the cellulose synthase, demonstrates how BcsA forms a cellulose-conducting channel, and suggests a model for the coupling of cellulose synthesis and translocation in which the nascent polysaccharide is extended by one glucose molecule at a time.","Morgan, Jacob L.

61,141,20.0,"The life cycles of many parasites involve transitions between disparate host species, requiring these parasites to go through multiple developmental stages adapted to each of these specialized niches. Transmission of malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.) from humans to the mosquito vector requires differentiation from asexual stages replicating within red blood cells into non-dividing male and female gametocytes. Although gametocytes were first described in 1880, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in commitment to gametocyte formation is extremely limited, and disrupting this critical developmental transition remains a long-standing goal(1). Here we show that expression levels of the DNA-binding protein PfAP2-G correlate strongly with levels of gametocyte formation. Using independent forward and reverse genetics approaches, we demonstrate that PfAP2-G function is essential for parasite sexual differentiation. By combining genome-wide PfAP2-G cognate motif occurrence with global transcriptional changes resulting from PfAP2-G ablation, we identify early gametocyte genes as probable targets of PfAP2-G and show that their regulation by PfAP2-G is critical for their wild-type level expression. In the asexual blood-stage parasites pfap2-g appears to be among a set of epigenetically silenced loci(2,3) prone to spontaneous activation(4). Stochastic activation presents a simple mechanism for a low baseline of gametocyte production. Overall, these findings identify PfAP2-G as a master regulator of sexual-stage development in malaria parasites and mark the first discovery of a transcriptional switch controlling a differentiation decision in protozoan parasites.","Kafsack, Bjoern F.

Here we describe the genome sequence of the wild grass Brachypodium distachyon (Brachypodium), which is, to our knowledge, the first member of the Pooideae subfamily to be sequenced. Comparison of the Brachypodium, rice and sorghum genomes shows a precise history of genome evolution across a broad diversity of the grasses, and establishes a template for analysis of the large genomes of economically important pooid grasses such as wheat. The high-quality genome sequence, coupled with ease of cultivation and transformation, small size and rapid life cycle, will help Brachypodium reach its potential as an important model system for developing new energy and food crops.","Vogel, John P.; Garvin, David F.; Mockler, Todd C.; Schmutz, Jeremy; Rokhsar, Dan; Bevan, Michael W.; Barry, Kerrie; Lucas, Susan; Harmon-Smoth, Miranda; Lail, Kathleen; Tice, Hope; Grimwood, Jane; McKenzie, Neil; Huo, Naxin; Gu, Yong Q; Lazo, Gerard R.; Anderson, Olin D.; You, Frank M.; Luo, Ming-Cheng; Dvorak, Jan; Wright, Jan; Febrer, Melanie; Idziak, Dominika; Hasterok, Robert; Lindquist, Erika; Wang, Mei; Fox, Samuel E.; Priest, Henry D.; Filichkin, Sergei A.; Givan, Scott A.; Bryant, Douglas W.; Chang, Jeff H.; Wu, Haiyan; Wu, Wei; Hsia, An-Ping; Schnable, Patrick S.; Kalyanaraman, Anantharaman; Baarbazuk, Brad; Michael, Todd P.; Hazen, Samuel P.; Bragg, Jennifer N.; Laudencia-Chingcuanco, Debbie; Weng, Yiqun; Haberer, Georg; Spannagl, Mianuel; Mayer, Klaus; Rattei, Thomas; Mitros, Therese; Lee, Sang-Jik; Rose, Jocelyn K.

63,116,450.0,"Ubiquinone (also known as coenzyme Q) is a ubiquitous lipid-soluble redox cofactor that is an essential component of electron transfer chains(1). Eleven genes have been implicated in bacterial ubiquinone biosynthesis, including ubiX and ubiD, which are responsible for decarboxylation of the 3-octaprenyl-4-hydroxy-benzoate precursor(2). Despite structural and biochemical characterization of UbiX as a flavin mononucleotide (FMN)-binding protein, no decarboxylase activity has been detected(3,4). Here we report that UbiX produces a novel flavin-derived cofactor required for the decarboxylase activity of UbiD(5). UbiX acts as a flavin prenyltransferase, linking a dimethylallyl moiety to the flavin N5 and C6 atoms. This adds a fourth non-aromatic ring to the flavin isoalloxazine group. In contrast to other prenyltransferases(6,7), UbiX is metal-independent and requires dimethylallyl-monophosphate as substrate. Kinetic crystallography reveals that the prenyltransferase mechanism of UbiX resembles that of the terpene synthases(8). The active site environment is dominated by pi systems, which assist phosphate-C1' bond breakage following FMN reduction, leading to formation of the N5-C1' bond. UbiX then acts as a chaperone for adduct reorientation, via transient carbocation species, leading ultimately to formation of the dimethylallyl C3'-C6 bond. Our findings establish the mechanism for formation of a new flavin-derived cofactor, extending both flavin and terpenoid biochemical repertoires.","White, Mark D.; Payne, Karl A.

64,72,371.0,"Nuclear pore complexes reside in the nuclear envelope of eukaryotic cells and mediate the nucleocytoplasmic exchange of macromolecules(1). Traffic is regulated by mobile transport receptors that target their cargo to the central translocation channel, where phenylalanine-glycine-rich repeats serve as binding sites(2). The structural analysis of the nuclear pore is a formidable challenge given its size, its location in a membranous environment and its dynamic nature. Here we have used cryo-electron tomography(3) to study the structure of nuclear pore complexes in their functional environment, that is, in intact nuclei of Dictyostelium discoideum. A new image-processing strategy compensating for deviations of the asymmetric units (protomers) from a perfect eight-fold symmetry enabled us to refine the structure and to identify new features. Furthermore, the superposition of a large number of tomograms taken in the presence of cargo, which was rendered visible by gold nanoparticles, has yielded a map outlining the trajectories of import cargo. Finally, we have performed single-molecule Monte Carlo simulations of nuclear import to interpret the experimentally observed cargo distribution in the light of existing models for nuclear import.","Beck, Martin; Lucic, Vladan; Foerster, Friedrich; Baumeister, Wolfgang; Medalia, Ohad","Beck, M; Lucic, V; Forster, F; Baumeister, W; Medalia, O",611.0,"Max Planck Inst Biochem, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06170,Article,,baumeist@biochem.mpg.de; omedalia@bgu.ac.il,615,,,216QG,,,PROTEIN IMPORT; NUCLEOCYTOPLASMIC TRANSPORT; SYSTEMS-ANALYSIS; VISUALIZATION; NUCLEOPORINS; ARCHITECTURE; REPEATS; BINDING; BETA,7162.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,"Foerster, Friedrich/0000-0002-6044-2746; Beck, Martin/0000-0002-7397-1321","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",4-Oct,5.0,LONDON,17851530.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007.0,"Foerster, Friedrich/D-3710-2009; Beck, Martin/B-5589-2011","Baumeister, W (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Biochem, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,220.0,Snapshots of nuclear pore complexes in action captured by cryo-electron tomography,2.0,48.0,WOS:000249893500048,371.0,449,Multidisciplinary Sciences,223,ohad,medalia,4760.0,22,male,1.0,uSm5jncAAAAJ,3,"(4126, 9345]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
65,197,418.0,"It is generally accepted that the direct connection from the motor cortex to spinal motor neurons is responsible for dexterous hand movements in primates(1-3). However, the role of the 'phylogenetically older' indirect pathways from the motor cortex to motor neurons, mediated by spinal interneurons, remains elusive. Here we used a novel double-infection technique to interrupt the transmission through the propriospinal neurons (PNs)(4-6), which act as a relay of the indirect pathway in macaque monkeys (Macaca fuscata and Macaca mulatta). The PNs were double infected by injection of a highly efficient retrograde gene-transfer vector into their target area and subsequent injection of adeno-associated viral vector at the location of cell somata. This method enabled reversible expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged tetanus neurotoxin, thereby permitting the selective and temporal blockade of the motor cortex-PN-motor neuron pathway. This treatment impaired reach and grasp movements, revealing a critical role for the PN-mediated pathway in the control of hand dexterity. Anti-GFP immunohistochemistry visualized the cell bodies and axonal trajectories of the blocked PNs, which confirmed their anatomical connection to motor neurons. This pathway-selective and reversible technique for blocking neural transmission does not depend on cell-specific promoters or transgenic techniques, and is a new and powerful tool for functional dissection in system-level neuroscience studies.","Kinoshita, Masaharu; Matsui, Ryosuke; Kato, Shigeki; Hasegawa, Taku; Kasahara, Hironori; Isa, Kaoru; Watakabe, Akiya; Yamamori, Tetsuo; Nishimura, Yukio; Alstermark, Bror; Watanabe, Dai; Kobayashi, Kazuto; Isa, Tadashi","Kinoshita, M; Matsui, R; Kato, S; Hasegawa, T; Kasahara, H; Isa, K; Watakabe, A; Yamamori, T; Nishimura, Y; Alstermark, B; Watanabe, D; Kobayashi, K; Isa, T",235.0,"[Kinoshita, Masaharu; Isa, Kaoru; Nishimura, Yukio; Isa, Tadashi] Natl Inst Physiol Sci, Dept Dev Physiol, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan; [Matsui, Ryosuke; Hasegawa, Taku; Kasahara, Hironori; Watanabe, Dai] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Biostudies, Dept Mol & Syst Biol, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Kato, Shigeki; Kobayashi, Kazuto] Fukushima Med Univ Sch Med, Inst Biomed Sci, Dept Mol Genet, Fukushima 9601295, Japan; [Watakabe, Akiya; Yamamori, Tetsuo] Natl Inst Basic Biol, Div Brain Biol, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan; [Watakabe, Akiya; Yamamori, Tetsuo; Nishimura, Yukio; Isa, Tadashi] Grad Univ Adv Studies Sokendai, Kanagawa 2400193, Japan; [Nishimura, Yukio] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy JST, Precursory Res Embryon Sci & Technol PRESTO, Tokyo 1020076, Japan; [Alstermark, Bror] Umea Univ, Physiol Sect, Dept Integrat Med Biol, S-90187 Umea, Sweden",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11206,Article,,tisa@nips.ac.jp,U1510,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan; Swedish Research Council","We thank S.

67,41,186.0,"It has been proposed that during embryonic development haematopoietic cells arise from a mesodermal progenitor with both endothelial and haematopoietic potential called the haemangioblast(1,2). A conflicting theory instead associates the first haematopoietic cells with a phenotypically differentiated endothelial cell that has haematopoietic potential ( that is, a haemogenic endothelium) (3-5). Support for the haemangioblast concept was initially provided by the identification during mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation of a clonal precursor, the blast colony- forming cell (BL-CFC), which gives rise to blast colonies with both endothelial and haematopoietic components(6,7). Although recent studies have now provided evidence for the presence of this bipotential precursor in vivo(8,9), the precise mechanism for generation of haematopoietic cells from the haemangioblast still remains completely unknown. Here we demonstrate that the haemangioblast generates haematopoietic cells through the formation of a haemogenic endothelium intermediate, providing the first direct link between these two precursor populations. The cell population containing the haemogenic endothelium is transiently generated during BL-CFC development. This cell population is also present in gastrulating mouse embryos and generates haematopoietic cells on further culture. At the molecular level, we demonstrate that the transcription factor Tal1 ( also known as Scl; ref. 10) is indispensable for the establishment of this haemogenic endothelium population whereas the core binding factor Runx1 ( also known as AML1; ref. 11) is critical for generation of definitive haematopoietic cells from haemogenic endothelium. Together our results merge the two a priori conflicting theories on the origin of haematopoietic development into a single linear developmental process.","Lancrin, Christophe; Sroczynska, Patrycja; Stephenson, Catherine; Allen, Terry; Kouskoff, Valerie; Lacaud, Georges","Lancrin, C; Sroczynska, P; Stephenson, C; Allen, T; Kouskoff, V; Lacaud, G",892.0,"[Lancrin, Christophe; Sroczynska, Patrycja; Stephenson, Catherine; Lacaud, Georges] Univ Manchester, Paterson Inst Canc Res, Canc Res UK Stem Cell Biol Grp, Manchester M20 4BX, Lancs, England; [Allen, Terry] Univ Manchester, Paterson Inst Canc Res, Canc Res UK Struct Cell Biol Grp, Manchester M20 4BX, Lancs, England; [Kouskoff, Valerie] Univ Manchester, Paterson Inst Canc Res, Canc Res UK Stem Cell Haematopoiesis Grp, Manchester M20 4BX, Lancs, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07679,Article,,glacaud@picr.man.ac.uk,895,Cancer Research UK,"We thank K.

68,163,9.0,"DNA methylation is a heritable epigenetic modification involved in gene silencing, imprinting, and the suppression of retrotransposons(1). Global DNA demethylation occurs in the early embryo and the germ line(2,3), and may be mediated by Tet (ten eleven translocation) enzymes(4-6), which convert 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC)(7). Tet enzymes have been studied extensively in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells(8-12), which are generally cultured in the absence of vitamin C, a potential cofactor for Fe(II) 2-oxoglutarate dioxygenase enzymes such as Tet enzymes. Here we report that addition of vitamin C to mouse ES cells promotes Tet activity, leading to a rapid and global increase in 5hmC. This is followed by DNA demethylation of many gene promoters and upregulation of demethylated germline genes. Tet1 binding is enriched near the transcription start site of genes affected by vitamin C treatment. Importantly, vitamin C, but not other antioxidants, enhances the activity of recombinant Tet1 in a biochemical assay, and the vitamin-C-induced changes in 5hmC and 5mC are entirely suppressed in Tet1 and Tet2 double knockout ES cells. Vitamin C has a stronger effect on regions that gain methylation in cultured ES cells compared to blastocysts, and in vivo are methylated only after implantation. In contrast, imprinted regions and intracisternal A particle retroelements, which are resistant to demethylation in the early embryo(2,13), are resistant to vitamin-C-induced DNA demethylation. Collectively, the results of this study establish vitamin C as a direct regulator of Tet activity and DNA methylation fidelity in ES cells.","Blaschke, Kathryn; Ebata, Kevin T.; Karimi, Mohammad M.; Zepeda-Martinez, Jorge A.; Goyal, Preeti; Mahapatra, Sahasransu; Tam, Angela; Laird, Diana J.; Hirst, Martin; Rao, Anjana; Lorincz, Matthew C.; Ramalho-Santos, Miguel","Blaschke, K; Ebata, KT; Karimi, MM; Zepeda-Martinez, JA; Goyal, P; Mahapatra, S; Tam, A; Laird, DJ; Hirst, M; Rao, A; Lorincz, MC; Ramalho-Santos, M",222.0,"[Blaschke, Kathryn; Ebata, Kevin T.; Laird, Diana J.; Ramalho-Santos, Miguel] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Eli & Edythe Broad Ctr Regenerat Med & Stem Cell, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Blaschke, Kathryn; Ebata, Kevin T.; Laird, Diana J.; Ramalho-Santos, Miguel] Univ Calif San Francisco, Ctr Reprod Sci, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Karimi, Mohammad M.; Goyal, Preeti; Lorincz, Matthew C.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Med Genet, Inst Life Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada; [Karimi, Mohammad M.; Tam, Angela; Hirst, Martin] British Columbia Canc Agcy, Canadas Michael Smith Genome Sci Ctr, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada; [Zepeda-Martinez, Jorge A.; Mahapatra, Sahasransu; Rao, Anjana] La Jolla Inst Allergy & Immunol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Zepeda-Martinez, Jorge A.; Mahapatra, Sahasransu; Rao, Anjana] Sanford Consortium Regenerat Med, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Hirst, Martin] Univ British Columbia, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Inst Life Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12362,Article,,mlorincz@mail.ubc.ca; mrsantos@diabetes.ucsf.edu,+,"NSF; California Institute of Regenerative Medicine postdoctoral training grant [TG2-01153]; Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research; CIHR [92093]; NIH [HD065812, CA151535, DP2OD004698, OD012204]; California Institute of Regenerative Medicine","The authors wish to acknowledge the epigenomics and sequencing groups at the Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre, Canada, for performing 5mC DIP and 5hmC DIP Illumina sequencing, as well as for technical support.

69,134,412.0,"P2Y receptors (P2YRs), a family of purinergic G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), are activated by extracellular nucleotides. There are a total of eight distinct functional P2YRs expressed in human, which are subdivided into P2Y1-like receptors and P2Y(12)-like receptors(1). Their ligands are generally charged molecules with relatively low bioavailability and stability in vivo(2), which limits our understanding of this receptor family. P2Y(12)R regulates platelet activation and thrombus formation(3,4), and several antithrombotic drugs targeting P2Y(12)R-including the prodrugs clopidogrel (Plavix) and prasugrel (Effient) that are metabolized and bind covalently, and the nucleoside analogue ticagrelor (Brilinta) that acts directly on the receptor-have been approved for the prevention of stroke and myocardial infarction. However, limitations of these drugs (for example, a very long half-life of clopidogrel action and a characteristic adverse effect profile of ticagrelor) 5,6 suggest that there is an unfulfilled medical need for developing a new generation of P2Y(12)R inhibitors(7,8). Here we report the 2.6 angstrom resolution crystal structure of human P2Y(12)R in complex with a non-nucleotide reversible antagonist, AZD1283. The structure reveals a distinct straight conformation of helix V, which sets P2Y(12)R apart from all other known class A GPCR structures. With AZD1283 bound, the highly conserved disulphide bridge in GPCRs between helix III and extracellular loop 2 is not observed and appears to be dynamic. Along with the details of the AZD1283-binding site, analysis of the extracellular interface reveals an adjacent ligand-binding region and suggests that both pockets could be required for dinucleotide binding. The structure provides essential insights for the development of improved P2Y(12)R ligands and allosteric modulators as drug candidates.","Zhang, Kaihua; Zhang, Jin; Gao, Zhan-Guo; Zhang, Dandan; Zhu, Lan; Han, Gye Won; Moss, Steven M.; Paoletta, Silvia; Kiselev, Evgeny; Lu, Weizhen; Fenalti, Gustavo; Zhang, Wenru; Mueller, Christa E.; Yang, Huaiyu; Jiang, Hualiang; Cherezov, Vadim; Katritch, Vsevolod; Jacobson, Kenneth A.; Stevens, Raymond C.; Wu, Beili; Zhao, Qiang","Zhang, KH; Zhang, J; Gao, ZG; Zhang, DD; Zhu, L; Han, GW; Moss, SM; Paoletta, S; Kiselev, E; Lu, WZ; Fenalti, G; Zhang, WR; Muller, CE; Yang, HY; Jiang, HL; Cherezov, V; Katritch, V; Jacobson, KA; Stevens, RC; Wu, BL; Zhao, Q",115.0,"[Zhang, Kaihua; Zhang, Jin; Zhang, Dandan; Zhu, Lan; Lu, Weizhen; Zhang, Wenru; Wu, Beili; Zhao, Qiang] Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Key Lab Receptor Res, Shanghai Inst Mat Med, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China; [Gao, Zhan-Guo; Moss, Steven M.; Paoletta, Silvia; Kiselev, Evgeny; Jacobson, Kenneth A.] NIDDK, Mol Recognit Sect, Bioorgan Chem Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Han, Gye Won; Fenalti, Gustavo; Cherezov, Vadim; Katritch, Vsevolod; Stevens, Raymond C.] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Integrat Struct & Computat Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Mueller, Christa E.] PharmaCtr Bonn, Inst Pharmaceut, D-53121 Bonn, Germany; [Yang, Huaiyu; Jiang, Hualiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Drug Discovery & Design Ctr, Shanghai Inst Mat Med, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China; [Stevens, Raymond C.] ShanghaiTech Univ, iHuman Inst, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13083,Article,1476-4687,zhaoq@simm.ac.cn,118,"National Basic Research Program of China [2012CB910400, 2012CB518000]; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R01 AI100604, U54 GM094618]; National Science Foundation of China [31370729, 31170683]; National Institute of General Medical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Associate program; NIH National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases Intramural Research Program","This work was supported by National Basic Research Program of China grants 2012CB910400 and 2012CB518000 (B.

70,232,303.0,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) remains a major medical problem. Antiviral treatment is only partially effective and a vaccine does not exist. Development of more effective therapies has been hampered by the lack of a suitable small animal model. Although xenotransplantation of immunodeficient mice with human hepatocytes has shown promise, these models are subject to important challenges. Building on the previous observation that CD81 and occludin comprise the minimal human factors required to render mouse cells permissive to HCV entry in vitro(4), we attempted murine humanization via a genetic approach. Here we show that expression of two human genes is sufficient to allow HCV infection of fully immunocompetent inbred mice. We establish a precedent for applying mouse genetics to dissect viral entry and validate the role of scavenger receptor type B class I for HCV uptake. We demonstrate that HCV can be blocked by passive immunization, as well as showing that a recombinant vaccinia virus vector induces humoral immunity and confers partial protection against heterologous challenge. This system recapitulates a portion of the HCV life cycle in an immunocompetent rodent for the first time, opening opportunities for studying viral pathogenesis and immunity and comprising an effective platform for testing HCV entry inhibitors in vivo.","Dorner, Marcus; Horwitz, Joshua A.; Robbins, Justin B.; Barry, Walter T.; Feng, Qian; Mu, Kathy; Jones, Christopher T.; Schoggins, John W.; Catanese, Maria Teresa; Burton, Dennis R.; Law, Mansun; Rice, Charles M.; Ploss, Alexander","Dorner, M; Horwitz, JA; Robbins, JB; Barry, WT; Feng, Q; Mu, K; Jones, CT; Schoggins, JW; Catanese, MT; Burton, DR; Law, M; Rice, CM; Ploss, A",208.0,"[Dorner, Marcus; Horwitz, Joshua A.; Barry, Walter T.; Feng, Qian; Mu, Kathy; Jones, Christopher T.; Schoggins, John W.; Catanese, Maria Teresa; Rice, Charles M.; Ploss, Alexander] Rockefeller Univ, Ctr Study Hepatitis C, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Robbins, Justin B.; Burton, Dennis R.; Law, Mansun] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Immunol & Microbial Sci, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Burton, Dennis R.] Scripps Res Inst, IAVI Neutralizing Antibody Ctr, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Burton, Dennis R.] Ragon Inst MGH MIT & Harvard, Boston, MA 02129 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10168,Article,,aploss@rockefeller.edu,U246,"National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases [RC1DK087193]; National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease [R01AI072613, R01AI079031, R01AI071084]; Starr Foundation; Greenberg Medical Institute; German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgesellschaft); Rockefeller University; National Institute of Health [F32DK082155, F32DK081193]","We thank J.

71,192,272.0,"B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) expression is an important feature of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), one of the most prevalent B-cell neoplasias in Western countries(1). The presence of stereotyped and quasi-identical BCRs in different CLL patients suggests that recognition of specific antigens might drive CLL pathogenesis. Here we show that, in contrast to other B-cell neoplasias, CLL-derived BCRs induce antigen-independent cell-autonomous signalling, which is dependent on the heavy-chain complementarity-determining region (HCDR3) and an internal epitope of the BCR. Indeed, transferring the HCDR3 of a CLL-derived BCR provides autonomous signalling capacity to a non-autonomously active BCR, whereas mutations in the internal epitope abolish this capacity. Because BCR expression was required for the binding of secreted CLL-derived BCRs to target cells, and mutations in the internal epitope reduced this binding, our results indicate a new model for CLL pathogenesis, with cell-autonomous antigen-independent signalling as a crucial pathogenic mechanism.","Duehren-von Minden, Marcus; Uebelhart, Rudolf; Schneider, Dunja; Wossning, Thomas; Bach, Martina P.; Buchner, Maike; Hofmann, Daniel; Surova, Elena; Follo, Marie; Koehler, Fabian; Wardemann, Hedda; Zirlik, Katja; Veelken, Hendrik; Jumaa, Hassan","Duhren-von Minden, M; Ubelhart, R; Schneider, D; Wossning, T; Bach, MP; Buchner, M; Hofmann, D; Surova, E; Follo, M; Kohler, F; Wardemann, H; Zirlik, K; Veelken, H; Jumaa, H",309.0,"[Duehren-von Minden, Marcus; Uebelhart, Rudolf; Schneider, Dunja; Wossning, Thomas; Bach, Martina P.; Hofmann, Daniel; Surova, Elena; Koehler, Fabian; Jumaa, Hassan] Univ Freiburg, Ctr Biol Signaling Studies BIOSS, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Uebelhart, Rudolf; Surova, Elena] Univ Freiburg, Spemann Grad Sch Biol & Med, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Buchner, Maike; Follo, Marie; Zirlik, Katja] Univ Med Ctr Freiburg, Dept Hematol Oncol, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [Wardemann, Hedda] Max Planck Inst Infect Biol, Max Planck Res Grp Mol Immunol, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Veelken, Hendrik] Leiden Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Hematol, NL-2333 ZA Leiden, Netherlands; [Jumaa, Hassan] Univ Freiburg, Fac Biol, Dept Mol Immunol, D-79108 Freiburg, Germany; [Jumaa, Hassan] Max Planck Inst Immunobiol & Epigenet, D-79108 Freiburg, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11309,Article,1476-4687,jumaa@immunbio.mpg.de,+,"Deutsche Krebshilfe [108935]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB746, JU463/2-1]; Excellence Initiative of the German Federal and State Governments [GSC-4]","We thank C.

72,236,404.0,"Activation of microglia and inflammation-mediated neurotoxicity are suggested to play a decisive role in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders. Activated microglia release pro-inflammatory factors that may be neurotoxic. Here we show that the orderly activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3/7, known executioners of apoptotic cell death, regulate microglia activation through a protein kinase C (PKC)-delta-dependent pathway. We find that stimulation of microglia with various inflammogens activates caspase-8 and caspase-3/7 in microglia without triggering cell death in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown or chemical inhibition of each of these caspases hindered microglia activation and consequently reduced neurotoxicity. We observe that these caspases are activated in microglia in the ventral mesencephalon of Parkinson's disease (PD) and the frontal cortex of individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Taken together, we show that caspase-8 and caspase-3/7 are involved in regulating microglia activation. We conclude that inhibition of these caspases could be neuroprotective by targeting the microglia rather than the neurons themselves.","Burguillos, Miguel A.; Deierborg, Tomas; Kavanagh, Edel; Persson, Annette; Hajji, Nabil; Garcia-Quintanilla, Albert; Cano, Josefina; Brundin, Patrik; Englund, Elisabet; Venero, Jose L.; Joseph, Bertrand","Burguillos, MA; Deierborg, T; Kavanagh, E; Persson, A; Hajji, N; Garcia-Quintanilla, A; Cano, J; Brundin, P; Englund, E; Venero, JL; Joseph, B",319.0,"[Burguillos, Miguel A.; Kavanagh, Edel; Hajji, Nabil; Joseph, Bertrand] Karolinska Inst, Dept Oncol Pathol, Canc Ctr Karolinska, S-17176 Stockholm, Sweden; [Burguillos, Miguel A.; Cano, Josefina; Venero, Jose L.] Univ Seville, Dept Bioquim & Biol Mol, Fac Farm, E-41012 Seville, Spain; [Burguillos, Miguel A.; Cano, Josefina; Venero, Jose L.] Inst Biomed Sevilla, Seville 41012, Spain; [Burguillos, Miguel A.; Deierborg, Tomas; Brundin, Patrik] Wallenberg Neurosci Ctr, Dept Expt Med Sci, Neuronal Survival Unit, S-22184 Lund, Sweden; [Persson, Annette; Englund, Elisabet] Univ Lund Hosp, Div Neuropathol, Dept Pathol, S-22185 Lund, Sweden; [Garcia-Quintanilla, Albert] Univ Seville, Serv Biol, CITIUS, Ctr Invest Tecnol & Innovac, E-41012 Seville, Spain",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09788,Article,1476-4687,jlvenero@us.es; bertrand.joseph@ki.se,U214,"Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnologia [SAF2006-04119, 2009-13778]; Swedish Research Council; Parkinson Foundation of Sweden; Swedish Alzheimer Foundation; Swedish Cancer Society","We thank A.

73,149,195.0,"Gut commensal microbes shape the mucosal immune system by regulating the differentiation and expansion of several types of T cell(1-5). Clostridia, a dominant class of commensal microbe, can induce colonic regulatory T (T-reg) cells, which have a central role in the suppression of inflammatory and allergic responses(3). However, the molecular mechanisms by which commensal microbes induce colonic T-reg cells have been unclear. Here we show that a large bowel microbial fermentation product, butyrate, induces the differentiation of colonic T-reg cells in mice. A comparative NMR-based metabolome analysis suggests that the luminal concentrations of short-chain fatty acids positively correlates with the number of T-reg cells in the colon. Among short-chain fatty acids, butyrate induced the differentiation of T-reg cells in vitro and in vivo, and ameliorated the development of colitis induced by adoptive transfer of CD4(+) CD45RB(hi) T cells in Rag1(-/-) mice. Treatment of naive T cells under the T-reg-cell-polarizing conditions with butyrate enhanced histone H3 acetylation in the promoter and conserved non-coding sequence regions of the Foxp3 locus, suggesting a possible mechanism for how microbial-derived butyrate regulates the differentiation of T-reg cells.

74,237,418.0,"Loss of function of the gene SCN9A, encoding the voltage-gated sodium channel Na(v)1.7, causes a congenital inability to experience pain in humans. Here we show that Na(v)1.7 is not only necessary for pain sensation but is also an essential requirement for odour perception in both mice and humans. We examined human patients with loss-of-function mutations in SCN9A and show that they are unable to sense odours. To establish the essential role of Na(v)1.7 in odour perception, we generated conditional null mice in which Na(v)1.7 was removed from all olfactory sensory neurons. In the absence of Na(v)1.7, these neurons still produce odour-evoked action potentials but fail to initiate synaptic signalling from their axon terminals at the first synapse in the olfactory system. The mutant mice no longer display vital, odour-guided behaviours such as innate odour recognition and avoidance, short-term odour learning, and maternal pup retrieval. Our study creates a mouse model of congenital general anosmia and provides new strategies to explore the genetic basis of the human sense of smell.","Weiss, Jan; Pyrski, Martina; Jacobi, Eric; Bufe, Bernd; Willnecker, Vivienne; Schick, Bernhard; Zizzari, Philippe; Gossage, Samuel J.; Greer, Charles A.; Leinders-Zufall, Trese; Woods, C.

75,190,262.0,"Organisms that protect their germ-cell lineages from damage often do so at considerable cost: limited metabolic resources become partitioned away from maintenance of the soma, leaving the ageing somatic tissues to navigate survival amid an environment containing damaged and poorly functioning proteins. Historically, experimental paradigms that limit reproductive investment result in lifespan extension. We proposed that germline-deficient animals might exhibit heightened protection from proteotoxic stressors in somatic tissues. We find that the forced re-investment of resources from the germ line to the soma in Caenorhabditis elegans results in elevated somatic proteasome activity, clearance of damaged proteins and increased longevity. This activity is associated with increased expression of rpn-6, a subunit of the 19S proteasome, by the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16. Ectopic expression of rpn-6 is sufficient to confer proteotoxic stress resistance and extend lifespan, indicating that rpn-6 is a candidate to correct deficiencies in age-related protein homeostasis disorders.","Vilchez, David; Morantte, Ianessa; Liu, Zheng; Douglas, Peter M.; Merkwirth, Carsten; Rodrigues, Ana P.

76,210,197.0,"Catabolism may give rise to toxic intermediates that compromise cell vitality, such as epoxide formation in the recently elucidated and apparently universal bacterial coenzyme A (CoA)-dependent degradation of phenylacetic acid(1). This compound is central to the catabolism of a variety of aromatics, such as phenylalanine, lignin-related compounds or environmental contaminants(2,3). The key phenylacetyl-CoA monooxygenase (epoxidase) of the pathway, PaaABCE(1,4,5), is also connected to the production of various primary and secondary metabolites(6-9), as well as to the virulence of certain pathogens(1,10,11). However, the enzyme complex has so far not been investigated in detail. Here we characterize the bacterial multicomponent monooxygenase PaaABCE that, surprisingly, not only transforms phenylacetyl-CoA into its ring-1,2-epoxide, but also mediates the NADPH-dependent removal of the epoxide oxygen, regenerating phenylacetyl-CoA with formation of water. We provide evidence for a catalytic di-iron centre that is probably the key to the unprecedented deoxygenation of an organic compound by an oxygenase. Presumably, the bifunctionality is vital to avoid toxic intracellular epoxide levels if the subsequent catabolic steps are impeded. Our data suggest that detoxification is assisted by two thioesterases (PaaI and PaaY) forming non-reactive breakdown products. Hence, PaaABCE may harbour an intrinsic escape mechanism from its own toxic product and represents the archetype of a bifunctional oxygenase/deoxygenase. Analogous reactions may possibly be catalysed by other di-iron epoxidases.","Teufel, Robin; Friedrich, Thorsten; Fuchs, Georg","Teufel, R; Friedrich, T; Fuchs, G",359.0,"[Teufel, Robin; Fuchs, Georg] Univ Freiburg, Fak Biol, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Friedrich, Thorsten] Univ Freiburg, Fak Chem, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10862,Article,,georg.fuchs@biologie.uni-freiburg.de,U161,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft,"We thank Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft for support; V.

77,117,460.0,"Mutations or amplification of the MET proto-oncogene are involved in the pathogenesis of several tumours(1-4), which rely on the constitutive engagement of this pathway for their growth and survival(1,5). However, MET is expressed not only by cancer cells but also by tumour-associated stromal cells, although its precise role in this compartment is not well characterized(6-11). Here we show that MET is required for neutrophil chemoattraction and cytotoxicity in response to its ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Met deletion in mouse neutrophils enhances tumour growth and metastasis. This phenotype correlates with reduced neutrophil infiltration to both the primary tumour and metastatic sites. Similarly, Met is necessary for neutrophil transudation during colitis, skin rash or peritonitis. Mechanistically, Met is induced by tumour-derived tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha or other inflammatory stimuli in both mouse and human neutrophils. This induction is instrumental for neutrophil transmigration across an activated endothelium and for inducible nitric oxide synthase production upon HGF stimulation. Consequently, HGF/MET-dependent nitric oxide release by neutrophils promotes cancer cell killing, which abates tumour growth and metastasis. After systemic administration of a MET kinase inhibitor, we prove that the therapeutic benefit of MET targeting in cancer cells is partly countered by the pro-tumoural effect arising from MET blockade in neutrophils. Our work identifies an unprecedented role of MET in neutrophils, suggests a potential 'Achilles' heel' of MET-targeted therapies in cancer, and supports the rationale for evaluating anti-MET drugs in certain inflammatory diseases.","Finisguerra, Veronica; Di Conza, Giusy; Di Matteo, Mario; Serneels, Jens; Costa, Sandra; Thompson, A.

78,85,331.0,"Protein folding is an inherently complex process involving coordination of the intricate networks of weak interactions that stabilize native three-dimensional structures. In the conventional paradigm, simple protein structures are assumed to fold in an all-or-none process(1) that is inaccessible to experiment. Existing experimental methods therefore probe folding mechanisms indirectly. A widely used approach interprets changes in protein stability(2) and/or folding kinetics(3,4), induced by engineered mutations, in terms of the structure of the native protein. In addition to limitations in connecting energetics with structure(5), mutational methods have significant experimental uncertainties(6) and are unable to map complex networks of interactions. In contrast, analytical theory predicts small barriers to folding and the possibility of downhill folding(7,8). These theoretical predictions have been confirmed experimentally in recent years(9-11), including the observation of global downhill folding(12). However, a key remaining question is whether downhill folding can indeed lead to the high-resolution analysis of protein folding processes(13). Here we show, with the use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), that the downhill protein BBL from Escherichia coli unfolds atom by atom starting from a defined three-dimensional structure. Thermal unfolding data on 158 backbone and side-chain protons out of a total of 204 provide a detailed view of the structural events during folding. This view confirms the statistical nature of folding, and exposes the interplay between hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic forces, backbone conformation and side-chain entropy. From the data we also obtain a map of the interaction network in this protein, which reveals the source of folding cooperativity. Our approach can be extended to other proteins with marginal barriers ( less than 3RT), providing a new tool for the study of protein folding.","Sadqi, Mourad; Fushman, David; Munoz, Victor","Sadqi, M; Fushman, D; Munoz, V",317.0,"Univ Maryland, Dept Chem & Biochem, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; Univ Maryland, Ctr Biomol Struct & Org, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature04859,Article,,vmunoz@umd.edu,321,,,064WT,,,CHEMICAL-SHIFTS; SPEED LIMIT; 2-STATE; MODEL; STABILITY; DOMAIN,7100.0,NATURE,Nature,English,29.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",20-Jul,5.0,LONDON,16799571.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,,"Munoz, V (reprint author), Univ Maryland, Dept Chem & Biochem, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,177.0,Atom-by-atom analysis of global downhill protein folding,1.0,27.0,WOS:000239122100042,331.0,442,Multidisciplinary Sciences,177,victor,munoz,8882.0,2234,male,1.0,5LLRxnsAAAAJ,3,"(4126, 9345]",7356774,1,31505624,1,Víctor Muñoz,Víctor Muñoz,0,0
79,207,173.0,"The Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction approximately 66 million years ago is conventionally thought to have been a turning point in mammalian evolution(1,2). Prior to that event and for the first two-thirds of their evolutionary history, mammals were mostly confined to roles as generalized, small-bodied, nocturnal insectivores(3), presumably under selection pressures from dinosaurs(4). Release from these pressures, by extinction of non-avian dinosaurs at the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary, triggered ecological diversification of mammals(1,2). Although recent individual fossil discoveries have shown that some mammalian lineages diversified ecologically during the Mesozoic era(5), comprehensive ecological analyses of mammalian groups crossing the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary are lacking. Such analyses are needed because diversification analyses of living taxa(6,7) allow only indirect inferences of past ecosystems. Here we show that in arguably the most evolutionarily successful clade of Mesozoic mammals, the Multituberculata, an adaptive radiation began at least 20 million years before the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs and continued across the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary. Disparity in dental complexity, which relates to the range of diets, rose sharply in step with generic richness and disparity in body size. Moreover, maximum dental complexity and body size demonstrate an adaptive shift towards increased herbivory. This dietary expansion tracked the ecological rise of angiosperms(8) and suggests that the resources that were available to multituberculates were relatively unaffected by the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction. Taken together, our results indicate that mammals were able to take advantage of new ecological opportunities in the Mesozoic and that at least some of these opportunities persisted through the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction. Similar broad-scale ecomorphological inventories of other radiations may help to constrain the possible causes of mass extinctions(9,10).","Wilson, Gregory P.; Evans, Alistair R.; Corfe, Ian J.; Smits, Peter D.; Fortelius, Mikael; Jernvall, Jukka","Wilson, GP; Evans, AR; Corfe, IJ; Smits, PD; Fortelius, M; Jernvall, J",457.0,"[Wilson, Gregory P.; Smits, Peter D.] Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Evans, Alistair R.; Smits, Peter D.] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Corfe, Ian J.; Fortelius, Mikael; Jernvall, Jukka] Univ Helsinki, Inst Biotechnol, Dev Biol Program, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Fortelius, Mikael] Univ Helsinki, Dept Geosci & Geog, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10880,Article,,gpwilson@u.washington.edu,460,National Science Foundation; Denver Museum; University of Washington; Australian Research Council; Monash University; Academy of Finland; EU SYNTHESYS [GB-TAF-4779],"We thank museums, institutions and individuals that made specimens available for this study (full list is available in Supplementary Information).

Biochemical analyses established that these PcG proteins exist in distinct multiprotein complexes that bind to and modify chromatin of target genes(1-4). Among those, Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) and the related dRing-associated factors (dRAF) complex contain an E3 ligase activity for monoubiquitination of histone H2A (refs 1-4). Here we show that the uncharacterized Drosophila PcG gene calypso encodes the ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase BAP1. Biochemically purified Calypso exists in a complex with the PcG protein ASX, and this complex, named Polycomb repressive deubiquitinase (PR-DUB), is bound at PcG target genes in Drosophila. Reconstituted recombinant Drosophila and human PR-DUB complexes remove monoubiquitin from H2A but not from H2B in nucleosomes. Drosophila mutants lacking PR-DUB show a strong increase in the levels of monoubiquitinated H2A. A mutation that disrupts the catalytic activity of Calypso, or absence of the ASX subunit abolishes H2A deubiquitination in vitro and HOX gene repression in vivo. Polycomb gene silencing may thus entail adynamic balance between H2A ubiquitination by PRC1 and dRAF, and H2A deubiquitination by PR-DUB.","Scheuermann, Johanna C.; Alonso, Andres Gaytan de Ayala; Oktaba, Katarzyna; Ly-Hartig, Nga; McGinty, Robert K.; Fraterman, Sven; Wilm, Matthias; Muir, Tom W.; Mueller, Juerg","Scheuermann, JC; Alonso, AGD; Oktaba, K; Ly-Hartig, N; McGinty, RK; Fraterman, S; Wilm, M; Muir, TW; Muller, J",243.0,"[Scheuermann, Johanna C.; Alonso, Andres Gaytan de Ayala; Oktaba, Katarzyna; Ly-Hartig, Nga; Fraterman, Sven; Wilm, Matthias; Mueller, Juerg] European Mol Biol Lab, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [McGinty, Robert K.; Muir, Tom W.] Rockefeller Univ, New York, NY 10065 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08966,Article,,juerg.mueller@embl.de,U138,NIH [RC2CA148354]; EMBL; DFG,"We thank T.

81,30,268.0,"Previous excavations at Mata Menge and Boa Lesa in the Soa Basin of Flores, Indonesia, recovered stone artefacts in association with fossilized remains of the large-bodied Stegodon florensis florensis(1-9). Zircon fission-track ages from these sites indicated that hominins had colonized the island by 0.88 +/- 0.07 million years (Myr) ago(6). Here we describe the contents, context and age of Wolo Sege, a recently discovered archaeological site in the Soa Basin that has in situ stone artefacts and that lies stratigraphically below Mata Menge and immediately above the basement breccias of the basin. We show using Ar-40/Ar-39 dating that an ignimbrite overlying the artefact layers at Wolo Sege was erupted 1.02 +/- 0.02 Myr ago, providing a new minimum age for hominins on Flores. This predates the disappearance from the Soa Basin of 'pygmy' Stegodon sondaari and Geochelone spp. (giant tortoise), as evident at the nearby site of Tangi Talo, which has been dated to 0.90 +/- 0.07 Myr ago(10). It now seems that this extirpation or possible extinction event and the associated faunal turnover were the result of natural processes rather than the arrival of hominins(9). It also appears that the volcanic and fluvio-lacustrine deposits infilling the Soa Basin may not be old enough to register the initial arrival of hominins on the island.","Brumm, Adam; Jensen, Gitte M.; van den Bergh, Gert D.; Morwood, Michael J.; Kurniawan, Iwan; Aziz, Fachroel; Storey, Michael","Brumm, A; Jensen, GM; van den Bergh, GD; Morwood, MJ; Kurniawan, I; Aziz, F; Storey, M",748.0,"[Jensen, Gitte M.; Storey, Michael] Roskilde Univ, Dept Environm Social & Spatial Change, Quaternary Dating Lab, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; [Brumm, Adam; van den Bergh, Gert D.; Morwood, Michael J.] Univ Wollongong, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Ctr Archaeol Sci, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; [Kurniawan, Iwan; Aziz, Fachroel] Geol Survey Inst, Bandung 40122, Indonesia; [van den Bergh, Gert D.] Natl Museum Nat Hist, NL-2333 CR Leiden, Netherlands",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08844,Article,1476-4687,abrumm@uow.edu.au; storey@ruc.dk,U123,"Australian Research Council (ARC); Australian National University; McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, University of Cambridge; D.

82,77,51.0,"Translation initiation is a major determinant of the overall expression level of a gene(1 - 3). The translation of functionally active protein requires the messenger RNA to be positioned on the ribosome such that the start/ initiation codon will be read first and in the correct frame. Little is known about the molecular basis for the interaction of mRNA with the ribosome at different states of translation. Recent crystal structures of the ribosomal subunits(4 - 8), the empty 70S ribosome(9) and the 70S ribosome containing functional ligands(10 - 13) have provided information about the general organization of the ribosome and its functional centres. Here we compare the X- ray structures of eight ribosome complexes modelling the translation initiation, post- initiation and elongation states. In the initiation and post- initiation complexes, the presence of the Shine - Dalgarno ( SD) duplex causes strong anchoring of the 5' end of mRNA onto the platform of the 30S subunit, with numerous interactions between mRNA and the ribosome. Conversely, the 5' end of the ' elongator' mRNA lacking SD interactions is flexible, suggesting a different exit path for mRNA during elongation. After the initiation of translation, but while an SD interaction is still present, mRNA moves in the 3' -->5' direction with simultaneous clockwise rotation and lengthening of the SD duplex, bringing it into contact with ribosomal protein S2.","Yusupova, Gulnara; Jenner, Lasse; Rees, Bernard; Moras, Dino; Yusupov, Marat","Yusupova, G; Jenner, L; Rees, B; Moras, D; Yusupov, M",391.0,"Inst Genet & Biol Mol & Cellulaire, F-67404 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature05281,Article,,marat@titus.u-strasbg.fr,394,,,105GL,,,ANGSTROM RESOLUTION; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; TRANSLATION INITIATION; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURES; BINDING SITE; SUBUNIT; SEQUENCES; CODON,7117.0,NATURE,Nature,English,25.0,No,"Yusupov, Marat/0000-0001-5544-0597; Jenner, Lasse/0000-0003-3917-8853","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",16-Nov,4.0,LONDON,17051149.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,"Yusupov, Marat/I-6126-2013; Yusupova , Gulnara/E-1877-2014","Yusupov, M (reprint author), Inst Genet & Biol Mol & Cellulaire, F-67404 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,175.0,Structural basis for messenger RNA movement on the ribosome,1.0,19.0,WOS:000242018300054,51.0,444,Multidisciplinary Sciences,181,marat,yusupov,8025.0,11,male,1.0,uGcWXC4AAAAJ,3,"(4126, 9345]",607978,1,2087394,1,List of Tatars,List of Tatars,0,0
83,238,451.0,"Red giants are evolved stars that have exhausted the supply of hydrogenin their cores and instead burn hydrogen in a surrounding shell(1,2). Once a red giant is sufficiently evolved, the helium in the core also undergoes fusion(3). Outstanding issues in our understanding of red giants include uncertainties in the amount of mass lost at the surface before helium ignition and the amount of internal mixing from rotation and other processes(4). Progress is hampered by our inability to distinguish between red giants burning helium in the core and those still only burning hydrogen in a shell. Asteroseismology offers a way forward, being a powerful tool for probing the internal structures of stars using their natural oscillation frequencies(5). Here we report observations of gravity-mode period spacings in red giants(6) that permit a distinction between evolutionary stages to be made. We use high-precision photometry obtained by the Kepler spacecraft over more than a year to measure oscillations in several hundred red giants. We find many stars whose dipole modes show sequences with approximately regular period spacings. These stars fall into two clear groups, allowing us to distinguish unambiguously between hydrogen-shell-burning stars (period spacing mostly similar to 50 seconds) and those that are also burning helium (period spacing similar to 100 to 300 seconds).","Bedding, Timothy R.; Mosser, Benoit; Huber, Daniel; Montalban, Josefina; Beck, Paul; Christensen-Dalsgaard, Jorgen; Elsworth, Yvonne P.; Garcia, Rafael A.; Miglio, Andrea; Stello, Dennis; White, Timothy R.; De Ridder, Joris; Hekker, Saskia; Aerts, Conny; Barban, Caroline; Belkacem, Kevin; Broomhall, Anne-Marie; Brown, Timothy M.; Buzasi, Derek L.; Carrier, Fabien; Chaplin, William J.; Di Mauro, Maria Pia; Dupret, Marc-Antoine; Frandsen, Soren; Gilliland, Ronald L.; Goupil, Marie-Jo; Jenkins, Jon M.; Kallinger, Thomas; Kawaler, Steven; Kjeldsen, Hans; Mathur, Savita; Noels, Arlette; Aguirre, Victor Silva; Ventura, Paolo","Bedding, TR; Mosser, B; Huber, D; Montalban, J; Beck, P; Christensen-Dalsgaard, J; Elsworth, YP; Garcia, RA; Miglio, A; Stello, D; White, TR; De Ridder, J; Hekker, S; Aerts, C; Barban, C; Belkacem, K; Broomhall, AM; Brown, TM; Buzasi, DL; Carrier, F; Chaplin, WJ; Di Mauro, MP; Dupret, MA; Frandsen, S; Gilliland, RL; Goupil, MJ; Jenkins, JM; Kallinger, T; Kawaler, S; Kjeldsen, H; Mathur, S; Noels, A; Aguirre, VS; Ventura, P",608.0,"[Bedding, Timothy R.; Huber, Daniel; Stello, Dennis; White, Timothy R.] Univ Sydney, Sch Phys, Sydney Inst Astron SIfA, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Mosser, Benoit; Barban, Caroline; Goupil, Marie-Jo] Univ Paris 07, Univ Paris 06, CNRS, LESIA,Observ Paris, F-92195 Meudon, France; [Montalban, Josefina; Miglio, Andrea; Dupret, Marc-Antoine; Noels, Arlette] Univ Liege, Inst Astrophys & Geophys, B-4000 Cointe Ougree, Belgium; [Beck, Paul; De Ridder, Joris; Aerts, Conny; Carrier, Fabien] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Inst Sterrenkunde, B-3001 Louvain, Belgium; [Christensen-Dalsgaard, Jorgen; Frandsen, Soren] Aarhus Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, DASC, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Elsworth, Yvonne P.; Miglio, Andrea; Hekker, Saskia; Broomhall, Anne-Marie; Chaplin, William J.] Univ Birmingham, Sch Phys & Astron, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Garcia, Rafael A.] Univ Paris 07, Ctr Saclay, IRFU SAp, Lab AIM,CEA DSM CNRS, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Hekker, Saskia] Univ Amsterdam, Astron Inst Anton Pannekoek, NL-1098 XH Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Aerts, Conny] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Astrophys, IMAPP, NL-6500 GL Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Belkacem, Kevin] Univ Paris 11, Inst Astrophys Spatiale, UMR 8617, F-91405 Orsay, France; [Brown, Timothy M.] Las Cumbres Observ Global Telescope, Goleta, CA 93117 USA; [Buzasi, Derek L.] Eureka Sci, Oakland, CA 94602 USA; [Di Mauro, Maria Pia] Ist Astrofis Spaziale & Fis Cosm, INAF IASF, I-00133 Rome, Italy; [Gilliland, Ronald L.] Space Telescope Sci Inst, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Jenkins, Jon M.] NASA, Ames Res Ctr, SETI Inst, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; [Kallinger, Thomas] Univ British Columbia, Dept Phys & Astron, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada; [Kawaler, Steven] Iowa State Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Mathur, Savita] NCAR, High Altitude Observ, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Aguirre, Victor Silva] Max Planck Inst Astrophys, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Ventura, Paolo] Osserv Astron Roma, INAF, I-00040 Monte Porzio Catone, RM, Italy",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09935,Article,1476-4687,t.bedding@physics.usyd.edu.au,611,NASA's Science Mission Directorate; Australian Research Council; European Community; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO); National Science Foundation,"We acknowledge the entire Kepler team, whose efforts made these results possible.

84,126,263.0,"Galaxies are believed to evolve through merging(1), which should lead to some hosting multiple supermassive black holes(2-4). There are four known triple black hole systems(5-8), with the closest black hole pair being 2.4 kiloparsecs apart (the third component in this system is at 3 kiloparsecs)(7), which is far from the gravitational sphere of influence (about 100 parsecs for a black hole with mass one billion times that of the Sun). Previous searches for compact black hole systems concluded that they were rare(9), with the tightest binary system having a separation of 7 parsecs (ref. 10). Here we report observations of a triple black hole system at redshift z = 0.39, with the closest pair separated by about 140 parsecs and significantly more distant from Earth than any other known binary of comparable orbital separation. The effect of the tight pair is to introduce a rotationally symmetric helical modulation on the structure of the large-scale radio jets, which provides a useful way to search for other tight pairs without needing extremely high resolution observations. As we found this tight pair after searching only six galaxies, we conclude that tight pairs are more common than hitherto believed, which is an important observational constraint for low-frequency gravitational wave experiments(11,12).","Deane, R.

85,87,49.0,"Skeletal growth relies on both biosynthetic and catabolic processes(1,2). While the role of the former is clearly established, how the latter contributes to growth-promoting pathways is less understood. Macroautophagy, hereafter referred to as autophagy, is a catabolic process that plays a fundamental part in tissue homeostasis(3). We investigated the role of autophagy during bone growth, which is mediated by chondrocyte rate of proliferation, hypertrophic differentiation and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition in growth plates(4). Here we show that autophagy is induced in growth-plate chondrocytes during post-natal development and regulates the secretion of type II collagen (Col2), the major component of cartilage ECM. Mice lacking the autophagy related gene 7 (Atg7) in chondrocytes experience endoplasmic reticulum storage of type II procollagen (PC2) and defective formation of the Col2 fibrillary network in the ECM. Surprisingly, post-natal induction of chondrocyte autophagy is mediated by the growth factor FGF18 through FGFR4 and JNK-dependent activation of the autophagy initiation complex VPS34-beclin-1. Autophagy is completely suppressed in growth plates from Fgf18(-/-) embryos, while Fgf18(+/-) heterozygous and Fgfr4(-/-) mice fail to induce autophagy during post-natal development and show decreased Col2 levels in the growth plate. Strikingly, the Fgf18(+/-) and Fgfr4(-/-) phenotypes can be rescued in vivo by pharmacological activation of autophagy, pointing to autophagy as a novel effector of FGF signalling in bone. These data demonstrate that autophagy is a developmentally regulated process necessary for bone growth, and identify FGF signalling as a crucial regulator of autophagy in chondrocytes.","Cinque, Laura; Forrester, Alison; Bartolomeo, Rosa; Svelto, Maria; Venditti, Rossella; Montefusco, Sandro; Polishchuk, Elena; Nusco, Edoardo; Rossi, Antonio; Medina, Diego L.; Polishchuk, Roman; De Matteis, Maria Antonietta; Settembre, Carmine","Cinque, L; Forrester, A; Bartolomeo, R; Svelto, M; Venditti, R; Montefusco, S; Polishchuk, E; Nusco, E; Rossi, A; Medina, DL; Polishchuk, R; De Matteis, MA; Settembre, C",272.0,"[Cinque, Laura; Forrester, Alison; Bartolomeo, Rosa; Svelto, Maria; Venditti, Rossella; Montefusco, Sandro; Polishchuk, Elena; Nusco, Edoardo; Medina, Diego L.; Polishchuk, Roman; De Matteis, Maria Antonietta; Settembre, Carmine] Telethon Inst Genet & Med TIGEM, I-80078 Pozzuoli, NA, Italy; [Cinque, Laura; Forrester, Alison; Bartolomeo, Rosa; Svelto, Maria; Settembre, Carmine] Dulbecco Telethon Inst, I-80078 Pozzuoli, NA, Italy; [Forrester, Alison; Svelto, Maria; Settembre, Carmine] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Med & Translat Sci, Med Genet Unit, I-80131 Naples, Italy; [Rossi, Antonio] Univ Pavia, Biochem Unit, Dept Mol Med, I-27100 Pavia, Italy",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature16063,Article,1476-4687,settembre@tigem.it,+,Italian Telethon Foundation [TCP12008]; Marie Curie European Reintegration Grant [PCIG13-GA-2013-618805]; STAR/Banco di Napoli; Italian Ministry of Research [FIRB RBFR13LH4X],"We thank A.

86,135,413.0,"The P2Y(12) receptor (P2Y(12)R), one of eight members of the P2YR family expressed in humans, is one of the most prominent clinical drug targets for inhibition of platelet aggregation. Although mutagenesis and modelling studies of the P2Y(12)R provided useful insights into ligand binding(1-4), the agonist and antagonist recognition and function at the P2Y(12)R remain poorly understood at the molecular level. Here we report the structures of the human P2Y(12)R in complex with the full agonist 2-methylthio-adenosine-5'-diphosphate (2MeSADP, a close analogue of endogenous agonist ADP) at 2.5 angstrom resolution, and the corresponding ATP derivative 2-methylthio-adenosine-5'-triphosphate (2MeSATP) at 3.1 angstrom resolution. These structures, together with the structure of the P2Y(12)R with antagonist ethyl 6-(4-((benzylsulfonyl) carbamoyl)piperidin-1-yl)-5-cyano-2-methylnicotinate (AZD1283)(5), reveal striking conformational changes between nucleotide and non-nucleotide ligand complexes in the extracellular regions. Further analysis of these changes provides insight into a distinct ligand binding landscape inthed-group of class AG-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Agonist and non-nucleotide antagonist adopt different orientations in the P2Y(12)R, with only partially overlapped binding pockets. The agonist-bound P2Y(12)R structure answers long-standing questions surrounding P2Y(12)R-agonist recognition, and reveals interactions with several residues that had not been reported to be involved in agonist binding. As a first example, to our knowledge, of a GPCR in which agonist access to the binding pocket requires large-scale rearrangements in the highly malleable extracellular region, the structural and docking studies will therefore provide invaluable insight into the pharmacology and mechanisms of action of agonists and different classes of antagonists for the P2Y(12)R and potentially for other closely related P2YRs.","Zhang, Jin; Zhang, Kaihua; Gao, Zhan-Guo; Paoletta, Silvia; Zhang, Dandan; Han, Gye Won; Li, Tingting; Ma, Limin; Zhang, Wenru; Mueller, Christa E.; Yang, Huaiyu; Jiang, Hualiang; Cherezov, Vadim; Katritch, Vsevolod; Jacobson, Kenneth A.; Stevens, Raymond C.; Wu, Beili; Zhao, Qiang","Zhang, J; Zhang, KH; Gao, ZG; Paoletta, S; Zhang, DD; Han, GW; Li, TT; Ma, LM; Zhang, WR; Muller, CE; Yang, HY; Jiang, HL; Cherezov, V; Katritch, V; Jacobson, KA; Stevens, RC; Wu, BL; Zhao, Q",119.0,"[Zhang, Jin; Zhang, Kaihua; Zhang, Dandan; Li, Tingting; Ma, Limin; Zhang, Wenru; Wu, Beili; Zhao, Qiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Mat Med, CAS Key Lab Receptor Res, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China; [Gao, Zhan-Guo; Paoletta, Silvia; Jacobson, Kenneth A.] Natl Inst Diabet & Digest & Kidney Dis, Mol Recognit Sect, Bioorgan Chem Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Han, Gye Won; Cherezov, Vadim; Katritch, Vsevolod; Stevens, Raymond C.] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Integrat Struct & Computat Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Mueller, Christa E.] Univ Bonn, PharmaCtr Bonn, D-53121 Bonn, Germany; [Yang, Huaiyu; Jiang, Hualiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Mat Med, Drug Discovery & Design Ctr, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China; [Stevens, Raymond C.] ShanghaiTech Univ, IHuman Inst, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13288,Article,1476-4687,beiliwu@simm.ac.cn; zhaoq@simm.ac.cn,122,"National Basic Research Program of China [2012CB910400, 2012CB518000, 2014CB910400]; National Institutes of Health [R01AI100604, U54 GM094618]; National Science Foundation of China [31370729]; National Science and Technology Major Project [2013ZX09507001, 2012ZX09301001]; National Institutes of Health NIDDK Intramural Research Program; National Natural Science Foundation of China [91313000]","This work was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China grants 2012CB910400, 2012CB518000 and 2014CB910400 (B.

87,142,32.0,"Historically, the study of speech processing has emphasized a strong link between auditory perceptual input and motor production output(1-4). A kind of 'parity' is essential, as both perception-and production-based representations must form a unified interface to facilitate access to higher-order language processes such as syntax and semantics, believed to be computed in the dominant, typically left hemisphere(5,6). Although various theories have been proposed to unite perception and production(2,7), the underlying neural mechanisms are unclear. Early models of speech and language processing proposed that perceptual processing occurred in the left posterior superior temporal gyrus (Wernicke's area) and motor production processes occurred in the left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's area)(8,9). Sensory activity was proposed to link to production activity through connecting fibre tracts, forming the left lateralized speech sensory-motor system(10). Although recent evidence indicates that speech perception occurs bilaterally(11-13), prevailing models maintain that the speech sensory-motor system is left lateralized(11,14-18) and facilitates the transformation from sensory-based auditory representations to motor-based production representations(11,15,16). However, evidence for the lateralized computation of sensory-motor speech transformations is indirect and primarily comes from stroke patients that have speech repetition deficits (conduction aphasia) and studies using covert speech and haemodynamic functional imaging(16,19). Whether the speech sensory-motor system is lateralized, like higher-order language processes, or bilateral, like speech perception, is controversial. Here we use direct neural recordings in subjects performing sensory-motor tasks involving overt speech production to show that sensory-motor transformations occur bilaterally. We demonstrate that electrodes over bilateral inferior frontal, inferior parietal, superior temporal, premotor and somatosensory cortices exhibit robust sensory-motor neural responses during both perception and production in an overt word-repetition task. Using a non-word transformation task, we show that bilateral sensory-motor responses can perform transformations between speech-perception-and speech-production-based representations. These results establish a bilateral sublexical speech sensory-motor system.","Cogan, Gregory B.; Thesen, Thomas; Carlson, Chad; Doyle, Werner; Devinsky, Orrin; Pesaran, Bijan","Cogan, GB; Thesen, T; Carlson, C; Doyle, W; Devinsky, O; Pesaran, B",94.0,"[Cogan, Gregory B.; Pesaran, Bijan] NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Thesen, Thomas; Carlson, Chad; Devinsky, Orrin] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Doyle, Werner; Devinsky, Orrin] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Neurosurg, New York, NY 10016 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12935,Article,1476-4687,bijan@nyu.edu,+,NIDCD [R03-DC010475]; Burroughs Wellcome Fund; NYSTAR; McKnight Scholar Award; Sloan Research Fellowship,"We would like to thank A.

88,78,91.0,"The terrestrial sediment record indicates that the Earth's climate varied drastically in the Precambrian era ( before 550 million years ago), ranging from surface temperatures similar to or higher than today's to global glaciation events(1). The most continuous record of sea surface temperatures of that time has been derived from variations in oxygen isotope ratios of cherts (siliceous sediments)(2), but the long-term cooling of the oceans inferred from those data(3-5) has been questioned because the oxygen isotope signature could have been reset through the exchange with hydrothermal fluids after deposition of the sediments(6). Here we show that the silicon isotopic composition of cherts more than 550 million years old shows systematic variations with age that support the earlier conclusion of long-term ocean cooling and exclude post-depositional exchange as the main source of the isotopic variations. In agreement with other lines of evidence(1,7), a model of the silicon cycle in the Precambrian era shows that the observed silicon isotope variations imply seawater temperature changes from about 70 degrees C 3,500 million years ago to about 20 degrees C 800 million years ago.","Robert, Francois; Chaussidon, Marc","Robert, F; Chaussidon, M",969.0,"Museum Natl Hist Nat, CNRS, LEME Nanoanal, UMS 2679, F-75005 Paris, France; Ctr Rech Petrog & Geochim, CRPG, CNRS, F-54501 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature05239,Article,,robert@mnhn.fr; chocho@crpg.cnrs-nancy.fr,972,,,098LZ,,,SOUTH-AFRICA; GEOCHEMISTRY; EVOLUTION; RATIOS; CHINA; MICROFOSSILS; TEMPERATURE; SOLUBILITY; DIATOMS; CYCLE,7114.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",26-Oct,4.0,LONDON,17066030.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,"Chaussidon, Marc/E-7067-2017","Robert, F (reprint author), Museum Natl Hist Nat, CNRS, LEME Nanoanal, UMS 2679, 57 Rue Cuvier, F-75005 Paris, France.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,176.0,A palaeotemperature curve for the Precambrian oceans based on silicon isotopes in cherts,3.0,50.0,WOS:000241523400049,91.0,443,Multidisciplinary Sciences,190,marc,chaussidon,8471.0,1555,male,1.0,PDpfUb4AAAAJ,3,"(4126, 9345]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
89,97,174.0,"It remains unclear whether biodiversity buffers ecosystems against climate extremes, which are becoming increasingly frequent worldwide(1). Early results suggested that the ecosystem productivity of diverse grassland plant communities was more resistant, changing less during drought, and more resilient, recovering more quickly after drought, than that of depauperate communities(2). However, subsequent experimental tests produced mixed results(3-13). Here we use data from 46 experiments that manipulated grassland plant diversity to test whether biodiversity provides resistance during and resilience after climate events. We show that biodiversity increased ecosystem resistance for a broad range of climate events, including wet or dry, moderate or extreme, and brief or prolonged events. Across all studies and climate events, the productivity of low-diversity communities with one or two species changed by approximately 50% during climate events, whereas that of high-diversity communities with 16-32 species was more resistant, changing by only approximately 25%. By a year after each climate event, ecosystem productivity had often fully recovered, or overshot, normal levels of productivity in both high-and low-diversity communities, leading to no detectable dependence of ecosystem resilience on biodiversity. Our results suggest that biodiversity mainly stabilizes ecosystem productivity, and productivity-dependent ecosystem services, by increasing resistance to climate events. Anthropogenic environmental changes that drive biodiversity loss thus seem likely to decrease ecosystem stability(14), and restoration of biodiversity to increase it, mainly by changing the resistance of ecosystem productivity to climate events.","Isbell, Forest; Craven, Dylan; Connolly, John; Loreau, Michel; Schmid, Bernhard; Beierkuhnlein, Carl; Bezemer, T.

90,222,25.0,"Many animals attract mating partners through the release of volatile sex pheromones, which can convey information on the species, gender and receptivity of the sender to induce innate courtship and mating behaviours by the receiver(1). Male Drosophila melanogaster fruitflies display stereotyped reproductive behaviours towards females, and these behaviours are controlled by the neural circuitry expressing male-specific isoforms of the transcription factor Fruitless (FRUM)(2-5). However, the volatile pheromone ligands, receptors and olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) that promote male courtship have not been identified in this important model organism. Here we describe a novel courtship function of Ionotropic receptor 84a (IR84a), which is a member of the chemosensory ionotropic glutamate receptor family(6), in a previously uncharacterized population of FRUM-positive OSNs. IR84a-expressing neurons are activated not by fly-derived chemicals but by the aromatic odours phenylacetic acid and phenylacetaldehyde, which are widely found in fruit and other plant tissues(7) that serve as food sources and oviposition sites for drosophilid flies(8). Mutation of Ir84a abolishes both odour-evoked and spontaneous electrophysiological activity in these neurons and markedly reduces male courtship behaviour. Conversely, male courtship is increased-in an IR84a-dependent manner-in the presence of phenylacetic acid but not in the presence of another fruit odour that does not activate IR84a. Interneurons downstream of IR84a-expressing OSNs innervate a pheromone-processing centre in the brain. Whereas IR84a orthologues and phenylacetic-acid-responsive neurons are present in diverse drosophilid species, IR84a is absent from insects that rely on long-range sex pheromones. Our results suggest a model in which IR84a couples food presence to the activation of the fru(M) courtship circuitry in fruitflies. These findings reveal an unusual but effective evolutionary solution to coordinate feeding and oviposition site selection with reproductive behaviours through a specific sensory pathway.","Grosjean, Yael; Rytz, Raphael; Farine, Jean-Pierre; Abuin, Liliane; Cortot, Jerome; Jefferis, Gregory S.

92,40,28.0,"Rydberg atoms have an electron in a state with a very high principal quantum number, and as a result can exhibit unusually long-range interactions. One example is the bonding of two such atoms by multipole forces to form Rydberg-Rydberg molecules with very large internuclear distances(1-3). Notably, bonding interactions can also arise from the low-energy scattering of a Rydberg electron with negative scattering length from a ground-state atom(4,5). In this case, the scattering-induced attractive interaction binds the ground-state atom to the Rydberg atom at a well-localized position within the Rydberg electron wavefunction and thereby yields giant molecules that can have internuclear separations of several thousand Bohr radii(6-8). Here we report the spectroscopic characterization of such exotic molecular states formed by rubidium Rydberg atoms that are in the spherically symmetric s state and have principal quantum numbers, n, between 34 and 40. We find that the spectra of the vibrational ground state and of the first excited state of the Rydberg molecule, the rubidium dimer Rb(5s)-Rb(ns), agree well with simple model predictions. The data allow us to extract the s-wave scattering length for scattering between the Rydberg electron and the ground-state atom, Rb(5s), in the low-energy regime (kinetic energy, <100meV), and to determine the lifetimes and the polarizabilities of the Rydberg molecules. Given our successful characterization of s-wave bound Rydberg states, we anticipate that p-wave bound states(9), trimer states(10) and bound states involving a Rydberg electron with large angular momentum-so-called trilobite molecules(5)-will also be realized and directly probed in the near future.","Bendkowsky, Vera; Butscher, Bjoern; Nipper, Johannes; Shaffer, James P.; Loew, Robert; Pfau, Tilman","Bendkowsky, V; Butscher, B; Nipper, J; Shaffer, JP; Low, R; Pfau, T",1005.0,"[Bendkowsky, Vera; Butscher, Bjoern; Nipper, Johannes; Shaffer, James P.; Loew, Robert; Pfau, Tilman] Univ Stuttgart, Phys Inst 5, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany; [Shaffer, James P.] Univ Oklahoma, Homer L Dodge Dept Phys & Astron, Norman, OK 73072 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07945,Article,,v.bendkowsky@physik.uni-stuttgart.de; t.pfau@physik.uni-stuttgart.de,U76,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [PF 381/4-1]; Landesstiftung Baden-Wurttemberg; Carl Zeiss foundation; Alexander von Humboldt foundation,"We would like to thank C.

93,143,112.0,"The protozoan parasites Trypanosoma brucei spp. cause important human and livestock diseases in sub-Saharan Africa. In mammalian blood, two developmental forms of the parasite exist: proliferative 'slender' forms and arrested 'stumpy' forms that are responsible for transmission to tsetse flies. The slender to stumpy differentiation is a density-dependent response that resembles quorum sensing in microbial systems and is crucial for the parasite life cycle, ensuring both infection chronicity and disease transmission(1). This response is triggered by an elusive 'stumpy induction factor' (SIF) whose intracellular signalling pathway is also uncharacterized. Laboratory-adapted (monomorphic) trypanosome strains respond inefficiently to SIF but can generate forms with stumpy characteristics when exposed to cell-permeable cAMP and AMP analogues. Exploiting this, we have used a genome-wide RNA interference library screen to identify the signalling components driving stumpy formation. In separate screens, monomorphic parasites were exposed to 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP(pCPT-cAMP) or 8-pCPT-2'-O-methyl-5'-AMP to select cells that were unresponsive to these signals and hence remained proliferative. Genome-wide Ion Torrent based RNAi target sequencing identified cohorts of genes implicated in each step of the signalling pathway, from purine metabolism, through signal transducers (kinases, phosphatases) to gene expression regulators. Genes at each step were independently validated in cells naturally capable of stumpy formation, confirming their role in density sensing in vivo. The putative RNA-binding protein, RBP7, was required for normal quorum sensing and promoted cell-cycle arrest and transmission competence when overexpressed. This study reveals that quorum sensing signalling in trypanosomes shares similarities to fundamental quiescence pathways in eukaryotic cells, its components providing targets for quorum-sensing interference-based therapeutics.","Mony, Binny M.; MacGregor, Paula; Ivens, Alasdair; Rojas, Federico; Cowton, Andrew; Young, Julie; Horn, David; Matthews, Keith","Mony, BM; MacGregor, P; Ivens, A; Rojas, F; Cowton, A; Young, J; Horn, D; Matthews, K",681.0,"[Mony, Binny M.; MacGregor, Paula; Ivens, Alasdair; Rojas, Federico; Cowton, Andrew; Young, Julie; Matthews, Keith] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Biol Sci, Inst Immunol & Infect Res, Ctr Immun Infect & Evolut, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland; [Horn, David] Univ Dundee, Coll Life Sci, Dundee DD1 5EH, Scotland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12864,Article,1476-4687,keith.matthews@ed.ac.uk,+,"Wellcome Trust [088293MA, 095831MA, 100320/Z/12/Z]","This work was funded by a Wellcome Trust Programme grant (088293MA) to K.M. and by a Wellcome Trust strategic award (095831MA) to the Centre for Immunity, Infection and Evolution.

Here we report the crystal structure of IKK beta in complex with an inhibitor, at a resolution of 3.6 angstrom. The structure reveals a trimodular architecture comprising the kinase domain, a ubiquitin-like domain (ULD) and an elongated, alpha-helical scaffold/dimerization domain (SDD). Unexpectedly, the predicted leucine zipper and helix-loop-helix motifs do not form these structures but are part of the SDD. The ULD and SDD mediate a critical interaction with I kappa B alpha that restricts substrate specificity, and the ULD is also required for catalytic activity. The SDD mediates IKK beta dimerization, but dimerization per se is not important for maintaining IKK beta activity and instead is required for IKK beta activation. Other IKK family members, IKK alpha, TBK1 and IKK-i, may have a similar trimodular architecture and function.","Xu, Guozhou; Lo, Yu-Chih; Li, Qiubai; Napolitano, Gennaro; Wu, Xuefeng; Jiang, Xuliang; Dreano, Michel; Karin, Michael; Wu, Hao","Xu, GZ; Lo, YC; Li, QB; Napolitano, G; Wu, XF; Jiang, XL; Dreano, M; Karin, M; Wu, H",325.0,"[Xu, Guozhou; Lo, Yu-Chih; Li, Qiubai; Wu, Hao] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Biochem, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Napolitano, Gennaro; Wu, Xuefeng; Karin, Michael] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Pharmacol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Jiang, Xuliang] EMD Serono Res Inst, Billerica, MA 01821 USA; [Dreano, Michel] Merck Serono, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09853,Article,,haowu@med.cornell.edu,U222,National Institutes of Health; American Heart Association; Cancer Research Institute; American Cancer Society,"We thank K.

95,79,197.0,"Antagonistic interactions between hosts and parasites are a key structuring force in natural populations, driving coevolution(1,2). However, direct empirical evidence of long-term host-parasite coevolution, in particular `Red Queen' dynamics-in which antagonistic biotic interactions such as host-parasite interactions can lead to reciprocal evolutionary dynamics-is rare(3-5), and current data, although consistent with theories of antagonistic coevolution, do not reveal the temporal dynamics of the process(6). Dormant stages of both the water flea Daphnia and its microparasites are conserved in lake sediments, providing an archive of past gene pools. Here we use this fact to reconstruct rapid coevolutionary dynamics in a natural setting and show that the parasite rapidly adapts to its host over a period of only a few years. A coevolutionary model based on negative frequency-dependent selection, and designed to mimic essential aspects of our host parasite system, corroborated these experimental results. In line with the idea of continuing host-parasite coevolution, temporal variation in parasite infectivity changed little over time. In contrast, from the moment the parasite was first found in the sediments, we observed a steady increase in virulence over time, associated with higher fitness of the parasite.","Decaestecker, Ellen; Gaba, Sabrina; Raeymaekers, Joost A.

96,51,440.0,"MicroRNAs ( miRNAs) are short RNAs that direct messenger RNA degradation or disrupt mRNA translation in a sequence- dependent manner(1-7). For more than a decade, attempts to study the interaction of miRNAs with their targets were confined to the 3' untranslated regions of mRNAs(1), fuelling an underlying assumption that these regions are the principal recipients of miRNA activity. Here we focus on the mouse Nanog, Oct4 ( also known as Pou5f1) and Sox2 genes(8-11) and demonstrate the existence of many naturally occurring miRNA targets in their amino acid coding sequence ( CDS). Some of the mouse targets analysed do not contain the miRNA seed, whereas others span exon - exon junctions or are not conserved in the human and rhesus genomes. miR-134, miR- 296 and miR- 470, upregulated on retinoic- acid- induced differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells, target the CDS of each transcription factor in various combinations, leading to transcriptional and morphological changes characteristic of differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells, and resulting in a new phenotype. Silent mutations at the predicted targets abolish miRNA activity, prevent the down regulation of the corresponding genes and delay the induced phenotype. Our findings demonstrate the abundance of CDS- located miRNA targets, some of which can be species- specific, and support an augmented model whereby animal miRNAs exercise their control on mRNAs through targets that can reside beyond the 39 untranslated region.","Tay, Yvonne; Zhang, Jinqiu; Thomson, Andrew M.; Lim, Bing; Rigoutsos, Isidore","Tay, Y; Zhang, JQ; Thomson, AM; Lim, B; Rigoutsos, I",1124.0,"[Rigoutsos, Isidore] IBM Corp, Thomas J Watson Res Ctr, Bioinformat & Pattern Discovery Grp, Yorktown Hts, NY 10598 USA; [Tay, Yvonne; Zhang, Jinqiu; Thomson, Andrew M.; Lim, Bing] ASTAR, Genome Inst Singapore, Singapore 138672, Singapore; [Lim, Bing] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Beth Israel Med Ctr, Boston, MA 02215 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07299,Article,,rigoutso@us.ibm.com,U12,"Agency for Science, Technology and Research of Singapore; A*STAR graduate scholarship; National Institutes of Health [DK47636, AI54973]","We thank T.

97,159,440.0,"Quantum point contacts are narrow, one-dimensional constrictions usually patterned in a two-dimensional electron system, for example by applying voltages to local gates. The linear conductance of a point contact, when measured as function of its channel width, is quantized(1-3) in units of G(Q) = 2e(2)/h, where e is the electron charge and h is Planck's constant. However, the conductance also has an unexpected shoulder at similar to 0.7 G(Q), known as the '0.7-anomaly'(4-12), whose origin is still subject to debate(11-21). Proposed theoretical explanations have invoked spontaneous spin polarization(4,17), ferromagnetic spin coupling(19), the formation of a quasi-bound state leading to the Kondo effect(13,14), Wigner crystallization(16,20) and various treatments of inelastic scattering(18,21). However, explicit calculations that fully reproduce the various experimental observations in the regime of the 0.7-anomaly, including the zero-bias peak that typically accompanies it(6,9-11), are still lacking. Here we offer a detailed microscopic explanation for both the 0.7-anomaly and the zero-bias peak: their common origin is a smeared van Hove singularity in the local density of states at the bottom of the lowest one-dimensional subband of the point contact, which causes an anomalous enhancement in the Hartree potential barrier, the magnetic spin susceptibility and the inelastic scattering rate. We find good qualitative agreement between theoretical calculations and experimental results on the dependence of the conductance on gate voltage, magnetic field, temperature, source-drain voltage (including the zero-bias peak) and interaction strength. We also clarify how the low-energy scale governing the 0.7-anomaly depends on gate voltage and interactions. For low energies, we predict and observe Fermi-liquid behaviour similar to that associated with the Kondo effect in quantum dots(22). At high energies, however, the similarities between the 0.7-anomaly and the Kondo effect end.","Bauer, Florian; Heyder, Jan; Schubert, Enrico; Borowsky, David; Taubert, Daniela; Bruognolo, Benedikt; Schuh, Dieter; Wegscheider, Werner; von Delft, Jan; Ludwig, Stefan","Bauer, F; Heyder, J; Schubert, E; Borowsky, D; Taubert, D; Bruognolo, B; Schuh, D; Wegscheider, W; von Delft, J; Ludwig, S",73.0,"[Bauer, Florian; Heyder, Jan; Schubert, Enrico; Borowsky, David; Taubert, Daniela; Bruognolo, Benedikt; von Delft, Jan; Ludwig, Stefan] Univ Munich, Ctr NanoSci, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Bauer, Florian; Heyder, Jan; Schubert, Enrico; Borowsky, David; Taubert, Daniela; Bruognolo, Benedikt; von Delft, Jan; Ludwig, Stefan] Univ Munich, Fak Phys, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Bauer, Florian; Heyder, Jan; Bruognolo, Benedikt; von Delft, Jan] Univ Munich, Arnold Sommerfeld Ctr Theoret Phys, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Schuh, Dieter] Univ Regensburg, Inst Angew Phys, D-93040 Regensburg, Germany; [Wegscheider, Werner] ETH, Solid State Phys Lab, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12421,Article,1476-4687,vondelft@lmu.de; ludwig@lmu.de,78,"DFG [SFB-631, SFB-TR12, De730/3-2, De730/4-1, De730/4-2, De730/4-3, HO 4687/1-3, LU819/4-1]; Cluster of Excellence Nanosystems Initiative Munich; Center for NanoScience; US National Science Foundation [NSF PHY05-51164]; DFG","We thank B.

98,157,374.0,"Sexual selection, through intra-male competition or female choice, is assumed to be a source of strong and sustained directional selection in the wild(1,2). In the presence of such strong directional selection, alleles enhancing a particular trait are predicted to become fixed within a population, leading to a decrease in the underlying genetic variation(3). However, there is often considerable genetic variation underlying sexually selected traits in wild populations, and consequently, this phenomenon has become a long-discussed issue in the field of evolutionary biology(1,4,5). In wild Soay sheep, large horns confer an advantage in strong intra-sexual competition, yet males show an inherited polymorphism for horn type and have substantial genetic variation in their horn size(6). Here we show that most genetic variation in this trait is maintained by a trade-off between natural and sexual selection at a single gene, relaxin-like receptor 2 (RXFP2). We found that an allele conferring larger horns, Ho+, is associated with higher reproductive success, whereas a smaller horn allele, Ho-P, confers increased survival, resulting in a net effect of overdominance (that is, heterozygote advantage) for fitness at RXFP2. The nature of this trade-off is simple relative to commonly proposed explanations for the maintenance of sexually selected traits, such as genic capture(7,8) ('good genes') and sexually antagonistic selection(5,9). Our results demonstrate that by identifying the genetic architecture of trait variation, we can determine the principal mechanisms maintaining genetic variation in traits under strong selection and explain apparently counter-evolutionary observations.","Johnston, Susan E.; Gratten, Jacob; Berenos, Camillo; Pilkington, Jill G.; Clutton-Brock, Tim H.; Pemberton, Josephine M.; Slate, Jon","Johnston, SE; Gratten, J; Berenos, C; Pilkington, JG; Clutton-Brock, TH; Pemberton, JM; Slate, J",93.0,"[Johnston, Susan E.; Gratten, Jacob; Slate, Jon] Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Johnston, Susan E.; Berenos, Camillo; Pilkington, Jill G.; Pemberton, Josephine M.] Univ Edinburgh, Inst Evolutionary Biol, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland; [Gratten, Jacob] Univ Queensland, Queensland Brain Inst, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Clutton-Brock, Tim H.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12489,Article,,Susan.Johnston@ed.ac.uk; j.slate@shef.ac.uk,+,Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC; European Research Council (ERC); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council CASE studentship,"We thank the numerous Soay sheep project members and volunteers for collection of data and samples; M.

99,24,106.0,"Chemical reactions inside single crystals are likely to be highly selective, but examples of single crystal to single crystal (SC-SC) transformations are uncommon, because crystallinity is difficult to retain following the rearrangement of atoms in the solid state(1-19). The most widely studied SC-SC transformations involve solvent exchange reactions in porous coordination polymers or metal-organic frameworks, which take advantage of the robust polymeric networks of the hosts(2,8,9-11). Examples of reactions occurring within molecular organic crystals generally involve photo-induced reactions, such as the coupling of alkenes or alkynes within the crystal(1,2,12-15). For nonporous molecular inorganic or organometallic crystals, single-crystal transformations involving the formation or cleavage of metal-ligand bonds are rare(17-21); known examples usually involve ligand loss from the single crystal and reversible religation, a process sometimes accompanied by decay of the single crystal to a microcrystalline powder(20,21). Here we report a series of SC-SC transformations that involve the interchange of multiple small gaseous ligands (N(2), CO, NH(3), C(2)H(4), H(2) and O(2)) at an iridium centre in molecular single crystals of a pincer Ir(I) complex. The single crystal remains intact during these ligand-exchange reactions, which occur within the crystal and do not require prior ligand extrusion. We reveal a selective catalytic transformation within a nonporous molecular crystal: pincer iridium single crystals ligated with nitrogen, ethylene or hydrogen show selective hydrogenation of ethylene relative to propylene (25:1) when surface sites are passified by CO.","Huang, Zheng; White, Peter S.; Brookhart, Maurice","Huang, Z; White, PS; Brookhart, M",598.0,"[Huang, Zheng; White, Peter S.; Brookhart, Maurice] Univ N Carolina, Dept Chem, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09085,Article,,mbrookhart@unc.edu,601,National Science Foundation under the auspices of the Centre for Enabling New Technologies through Catalysis (CENTC),This work is financially supported by the National Science Foundation under the auspices of the Centre for Enabling New Technologies through Catalysis (CENTC).,604AF,,,COORDINATION POLYMER; TRANSFER DEHYDROGENATION; PINCER COMPLEXES; IRIDIUM; TRANSFORMATION; ELIMINATION; CONVERSION; FRAMEWORK; NETWORK; BONDS,7298.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,"Huang, Zheng/0000-0001-7524-098X","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",3-Jun,4.0,LONDON,20520710.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2010.0,,"Brookhart, M (reprint author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Chem, CB 3290, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,90.0,Ligand exchanges and selective catalytic hydrogenation in molecular single crystals,11.0,144.0,WOS:000278249000037,106.0,465,Multidisciplinary Sciences,90,maurice,brookhart,14946.0,221,male,0.98,3mxyA2QAAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",9447856,1,8150458,1,Maurice Brookhart,Maurice Brookhart,1,1
100,121,73.0,"Mutations that deregulate Notch1 and Ras/phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt signalling are prevalent in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL), and often coexist. Here we show that the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 is active against primary T-ALLs from wild-type and Kras(G12D) mice, and addition of the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 increases its efficacy. Mice invariably relapsed after treatment with drug-resistant clones, most of which unexpectedly had reduced levels of activated Notch1 protein, downregulated many Notch1 target genes, and exhibited cross-resistance to gamma-secretase inhibitors. Multiple resistant primary T-ALLs that emerged in vivo did not contain somatic Notch1 mutations present in the parental leukaemia. Importantly, resistant clones upregulated PI3K signalling. Consistent with these data, inhibiting Notch1 activated the PI3K pathway, providing a likely mechanism for selection against oncogenic Notch1 signalling. These studies validate PI3K as a therapeutic target in T-ALL and raise the unexpected possibility that dual inhibition of PI3K and Notch1 signalling could promote drug resistance in T-ALL.","Dail, Monique; Wong, Jason; Lawrence, Jessica; O'Connor, Daniel; Nakitandwe, Joy; Chen, Shann-Ching; Xu, Jin; Lee, Leslie B.; Akagi, Keiko; Li, Qing; Aster, Jon C.; Pear, Warren S.; Downing, James R.; Sampath, Deepak; Shannon, Kevin","Dail, M; Wong, J; Lawrence, J; O'Connor, D; Nakitandwe, J; Chen, SC; Xu, J; Lee, LB; Akagi, K; Li, Q; Aster, JC; Pear, WS; Downing, JR; Sampath, D; Shannon, K",512.0,"[Dail, Monique; Wong, Jason; Lawrence, Jessica; O'Connor, Daniel; Xu, Jin; Shannon, Kevin] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pediat, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Dail, Monique; Wong, Jason; Lawrence, Jessica; O'Connor, Daniel; Xu, Jin; Shannon, Kevin] Univ Calif San Francisco, Benniof Childrens Hosp, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Nakitandwe, Joy; Chen, Shann-Ching; Downing, James R.] St Jude Childrens Res Hosp, Dept Pathol, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Lee, Leslie B.; Sampath, Deepak] Genentech Inc, Dept Translat Oncol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Akagi, Keiko] Ohio State Univ, Dept Mol Virol Immunol & Med Genet, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Li, Qing] Univ Michigan, Dept Med, Div Haematol Oncol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Aster, Jon C.] Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Pear, Warren S.] Univ Penn, Abramson Family Canc Res Inst, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Pear, Warren S.] Univ Penn, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Perelman Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13495,Article,1476-4687,shannonk@peds.ucsf.edu,+,"William Lawrence and Blanche Hughes Foundation; Specialized Center of Research (SCOR) from the Leukaemia and Lymphoma Society of America [7019, 7703]; National Institutes of Health [R37 CA72614, R01 CA180037, K99 CA157950, K08 CA134649, P01 CA119070]; ALSAC of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital; Ohio Supercomputer Center [PAS0425]; Ohio Cancer Research Associate [GRT00024299]; American Cancer Society (ACS)","This work was supported by grants from the William Lawrence and Blanche Hughes Foundation to J.C.A. and K.

101,28,269.0,"For more than three-quarters of a century it has been assumed(1) that basal metabolic rate increases as body mass raised to some power p. However, there is no broad consensus regarding the value of p: whereas many studies have asserted that p is 3/4 (refs 1-4; 'Kleiber's law'), some have argued that it is 2/3 (refs 5-7), and others have found that it varies depending on factors like environment and taxonomy(6,8-16). Here we show that the relationship between mass and metabolic rate has convex curvature on a logarithmic scale, and is therefore not a pure power law, even after accounting for body temperature. This finding has several consequences. First, it provides an explanation for the puzzling variability in estimates of p, settling a long-standing debate. Second, it constitutes a stringent test for theories of metabolic scaling. A widely debated model(17) based on vascular system architecture fails this test, and we suggest modifications that could bring it into compliance with the observed curvature. Third, it raises the intriguing question of whether the scaling relation limits body size.","Kolokotrones, Tom; Savage, Van; Deeds, Eric J.; Fontana, Walter","Kolokotrones, T; Savage, V; Deeds, EJ; Fontana, W",753.0,"[Kolokotrones, Tom; Deeds, Eric J.; Fontana, Walter] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Savage, Van] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08920,Article,1476-4687,walter@hms.harvard.edu,756,NIA NIH HHS [R01 AG034994],,577EO,,,BODY SIZE; ENERGY-METABOLISM; STATISTICAL ARTIFACT; MAMMALS; TEMPERATURE; BIOLOGY; POWER,7289.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1-Apr,4.0,LONDON,20360740.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2010.0,,"Fontana, W (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,184.0,Curvature in metabolic scaling,9.0,88.0,WOS:000276205000044,269.0,464,Multidisciplinary Sciences,189,walter,fontana,13065.0,864,male,1.0,bz8Z_0UAAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
102,110,24.0,"Magnetohydrodynamic turbulence is important in many high-energy astrophysical systems, where instabilities can amplify the local magnetic field over very short timescales(1,2). Specifically, the magnetorotational instability and dynamo action(3-6) have been suggested as a mechanism for the growth of magnetar-strength magnetic fields (of 10(15) gauss and above) and for powering the explosion(7-10) of a rotating massive star(11,12). Such stars are candidate progenitors of type Ic-bl hypernovae(13,14), which make up all supernovae that are connected to long gamma-ray bursts(15,16). The magnetorotational instability has been studied with local high-resolution shearing-box simulations in three dimensions(17-19), and with global two-dimensional simulations(20), but it is not known whether turbulence driven by this instability can result in the creation of a large-scale, ordered and dynamically relevant field. Here we report results from global, three-dimensional, general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic turbulence simulations. We show that hydromagnetic turbulence in rapidly rotating protoneutron stars produces an inverse cascade of energy. We find a large-scale, ordered toroidal field that is consistent with the formation of bipolar magnetorotationally driven outflows. Our results demonstrate that rapidly rotating massive stars are plausible progenitors for both type Ic-bl supernovae(13,21,22) and long gamma-ray bursts, and provide a viable mechanism for the formation of magnetars(23,24). Moreover, our findings suggest that rapidly rotating massive stars might lie behind potentially magnetar-powered superluminous supernovae(25,26).","Moesta, Philipp; Ott, Christian D.; Radice, David; Roberts, Luke F.; Schnetter, Erik; Haas, Roland","Mosta, P; Ott, CD; Radice, D; Roberts, LF; Schnetter, E; Haas, R",376.0,"[Moesta, Philipp; Ott, Christian D.; Radice, David; Roberts, Luke F.] CALTECH, Walter Burke Inst Theoret Phys, TAPIR, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Moesta, Philipp] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Astron, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Schnetter, Erik] Perimeter Inst Theoret Phys, Waterloo, ON N2L 2Y5, Canada; [Schnetter, Erik] Univ Guelph, Dept Phys, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Schnetter, Erik] Louisiana State Univ, Ctr Computat & Technol, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Haas, Roland] Max Planck Inst Gravitat Phys, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15755,Article,1476-4687,pmoesta@berkeley.edu,+,"National Science Foundation (NSF) [AST-1212170, PHY-1151197, OCI-0905046]; NASA [PF5-160140, PF3-140114]; National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Sherman Fairchild Foundation","We thank S.

103,71,405.0,"Long-held ideas regarding the evolutionary relationships among animals have recently been upended by sometimes controversial hypotheses based largely on insights from molecular data(1,2). These new hypotheses include a clade of moulting animals (Ecdysozoa)(3) and the close relationship of the lophophorates to molluscs and annelids (Lophotrochozoa)(4). Many relationships remain disputed, including those that are required to polarize key features of character evolution, and support for deep nodes is often low. Phylogenomic approaches, which use data from many genes, have shown promise for resolving deep animal relationships, but are hindered by a lack of data from many important groups. Here we report a total of 39.9 Mb of expressed sequence tags from 29 animals belonging to 21 phyla, including 11 phyla previously lacking genomic or expressed-sequence-tag data. Analysed in combination with existing sequences, our data reinforce several previously identified clades that split deeply in the animal tree (including Protostomia, Ecdysozoa and Lophotrochozoa), unambiguously resolve multiple long-standing issues for which there was strong conflicting support in earlier studies with less data (such as velvet worms rather than tardigrades as the sister group of arthropods(5)), and provide molecular support for the monophyly of molluscs, a group long recognized by morphologists. In addition, we find strong support for several new hypotheses. These include a clade that unites annelids (including sipunculans and echiurans) with nemerteans, phoronids and brachiopods, molluscs as sister to that assemblage, and the placement of ctenophores as the earliest diverging extant multicellular animals. A single origin of spiral cleavage (with subsequent losses) is inferred from well-supported nodes.

104,43,60.0,"The Nernst effect in metals is highly sensitive to two kinds of phase transition: superconductivity and density-wave order(1). The large, positive Nernst signal observed in hole-doped high-T-c superconductors(2) above their transition temperature (T-c) has so far been attributed to fluctuating superconductivity(3). Here we report that in some of these materials the large Nernst signal is in fact the result of stripe order, a form of spin/charge modulation(4) that causes a reconstruction of the Fermi surface(5). In La2-xSrxCuO4 (LSCO) doped with Nd or Eu, the onset of stripe order causes the Nernst signal to change from being small and negative to being large and positive, as revealed either by lowering the hole concentration across the quantum critical point in Nd-doped LSCO (refs 6-8) or by lowering the temperature across the ordering temperature in Eu-doped LSCO (refs 9, 10). In the second case, two separate peaks are resolved, respectively associated with the onset of stripe order at high temperature and superconductivity near T-c.","Cyr-Choiniere, Olivier; Daou, R.; Laliberte, Francis; LeBoeuf, David; Doiron-Leyraud, Nicolas; Chang, J.; Yan, J. -Q.; Cheng, J. -G.; Zhou, J. -S.; Goodenough, J.

105,187,74.0,"Antigen-presenting molecules, encoded by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and CD1 family, bind peptide- and lipid-based antigens, respectively, for recognition by T cells. Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are an abundant population of innate-like T cells in humans that are activated by an antigen(s) bound to the MHC class I-like molecule MR1. Although the identity of MR1-restricted antigen(s) is unknown, it is present in numerous bacteria and yeast. Here we show that the structure and chemistry within the antigen-binding cleft of MR1 is distinct from the MHC and CD1 families. MR1 is ideally suited to bind ligands originating from vitamin metabolites. The structure of MR1 in complex with 6-formyl pterin, a folic acid (vitamin B9) metabolite, shows the pterin ring sequestered within MR1. Furthermore, we characterize related MR1-restricted vitamin derivatives, originating from the bacterial riboflavin (vitamin B2) biosynthetic pathway, which specifically and potently activate MAIT cells. Accordingly, we show that metabolites of vitamin B represent a class of antigen that are presented by MR1 for MAIT-cell immunosurveillance. As many vitamin biosynthetic pathways are unique to bacteria and yeast, our data suggest that MAIT cells use these metabolites to detect microbial infection.","Kjer-Nielsen, Lars; Patel, Onisha; Corbett, Alexandra J.; Le Nours, Jerome; Meehan, Bronwyn; Liu, Ligong; Bhati, Mugdha; Chen, Zhenjun; Kostenko, Lyudmila; Reantragoon, Rangsima; Williamson, Nicholas A.; Purcell, Anthony W.; Dudek, Nadine L.; McConville, Malcolm J.; O'Hair, Richard A.

106,68,396.0,"The retinotectal projection has long been studied experimentally and theoretically, as a model for the formation of topographic brain maps(1-3). Neighbouring retinal ganglion cells ( RGCs) project their axons to neighbouring positions in the optic tectum, thus reestablishing a continuous neural representation of visual space. Mapping along this axis requires chemorepellent signalling from tectal cells, expressing ephrin- A ligands, to retinal growth cones, expressing EphA receptors(4). High concentrations of ephrin A, increasing from anterior to posterior, prevent temporal axons from invading the posterior tectum. However, the force that drives nasal axons to extend past the anterior tectum and terminate in posterior regions remains to be identified. We tested whether axon - axon interactions, such as competition, are required for posterior tectum innervation. By transplanting blastomeres from a wild- type ( WT) zebrafish into a lakritz ( lak) mutant, which lacks all RGCs(5), we created chimaeras with eyes that contained single RGCs. These solitary RGCs often extended axons into the tectum, where they branched to form a terminal arbor. Here we show that the distal tips of these arbors were positioned at retinotopically appropriate positions, ruling out an essential role for competition in innervation of the ephrin- A- rich posterior tectum. However, solitary arbors were larger and more complex than under normal, crowded conditions, owing to a lack of pruning of proximal branches during refinement of the retinotectal projection. We conclude that dense innervation is not required for targeting of retinal axons within the zebrafish tectum but serves to restrict arbor size and shape.","Gosse, Nathan J.; Nevin, Linda M.; Baier, Herwig","Gosse, NJ; Nevin, LM; Baier, H",892.0,"[Gosse, Nathan J.; Baier, Herwig] Univ Calif San Francisco, Program Dev Biol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Nevin, Linda M.; Baier, Herwig] Univ Calif San Francisco, Neurosci Program, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06816,Article,,herwig.baier@ucsf.edu,U9,"NEI NIH HHS [R01 EY012406-09, R01 EY012406, R01 EY012406-06A2, R01 EY012406-07, R01 EY012406-08, R01 EY013855, R01 EY013855-01A1, R01 EY013855-02, R01 EY013855-03, R01 EY013855-04, R01 EY013855-05, R01 EY013855-06, R01 EY013855-07, R01 EY013855-08]",,288ZY,,,RETINOTECTAL PROJECTION; RETINAL AXONS; NEURAL MAP; IN-VIVO; ZEBRAFISH RETINA; EPHRIN-AS; GRADIENTS; GROWTH; MODEL; CONNECTIONS,7189.0,NATURE,Nature,English,31.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",17-Apr,5.0,LONDON,18368050.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,,"Baier, H (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Program Dev Biol, 1550 4th St, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,53.0,Retinotopic order in the absence of axon competition,0.0,5.0,WOS:000255026000052,396.0,452,Multidisciplinary Sciences,54,herwig,baier,9352.0,2,male,1.0,e80hnfEAAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",54245881,1,54245881,1,Herwig Baier,Herwig Baier,1,1
107,52,481.0,"Maintenance methylation of hemimethylated CpG dinucleotides at DNA replication forks is the key to faithful mitotic inheritance of genomic methylation patterns. UHRF1 ( ubiquitin- like, containing PHD and RING finger domains 1) is required for maintenance methylation by interacting with DNA nucleotide methyltransferase 1 ( DNMT1), the maintenance methyltransferase, and with hemi-methylated CpG, the substrate for DNMT1 ( refs 1 and 2). Here we present the crystal structure of the SET and RING- associated ( SRA) domain of mouse UHRF1 in complex with DNA containing a hemimethylated CpGsite. The DNA is contacted in both the major and minor grooves by two loops that penetrate into the middle of the DNA helix. The 5- methylcytosine has flipped completely out of the DNA helix and is positioned in a binding pocket with planar stacking contacts, Watson - Crick polar hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions specific for 5- methylcytosine. Hence, UHRF1 contains a previously unknown DNA- binding module and is the first example of a non- enzymatic, sequence- specific DNA- binding protein domain to use the base flipping mechanism to interact with DNA.","Hashimoto, Hideharu; Horton, John R.; Zhang, Xing; Bostick, Magnolia; Jacobsen, Steven E.; Cheng, Xiaodong","Hashimoto, H; Horton, JR; Zhang, X; Bostick, M; Jacobsen, SE; Cheng, XD",826.0,"[Hashimoto, Hideharu; Horton, John R.; Zhang, Xing; Cheng, Xiaodong] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Bostick, Magnolia; Jacobsen, Steven E.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Mol Cell & Dev Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Jacobsen, Steven E.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07280,Article,,xcheng@emory.edu,U14,"National Institutes of Health [GM049245, GM060398]; NIH-NSRA Fellowship [CA1263022]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Georgia Research Alliance Eminent Scholar",We thank R.

108,17,428.0,"DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) pose a potent threat to genome integrity. These lesions also contribute to the efficacy of radiotherapy and many cancer chemotherapeutics. DSBs elicit a signalling cascade that modifies the chromatin surrounding the break, first by ATM-dependent phosphorylation and then by RNF8-, RNF168- and BRCA1-dependent regulatory ubiquitination. Here we report that OTUB1, a deubiquitinating enzyme, is an inhibitor of DSB-induced chromatin ubiquitination. Surprisingly, we found that OTUB1 suppresses RNF168-dependent poly-ubiquitination independently of its catalytic activity. OTUB1 does so by binding to and inhibiting UBC13 (also known as UBE2N), the cognate E2 enzyme for RNF168. This unusual mode of regulation is unlikely to be limited to UBC13 because analysis of OTUB1-associated proteins revealed that OTUB1 binds to E2s of the UBE2D and UBE2E subfamilies. Finally, OTUB1 depletion mitigates the DSB repair defect associated with defective ATM signalling, indicating that pharmacological targeting of the OTUB1-UBC13 interaction might enhance the DNA damage response.","Nakada, Shinichiro; Tai, Ikue; Panier, Stephanie; Al-Hakim, Abdallah; Iemura, Shun-ichiro; Juang, Yu-Chi; O'Donnell, Lara; Kumakubo, Ayako; Munro, Meagan; Sicheri, Frank; Gingras, Anne-Claude; Natsume, Tohru; Suda, Toshio; Durocher, Daniel","Nakada, S; Tai, I; Panier, S; Al-Hakim, A; Iemura, S; Juang, YC; O'Donnell, L; Kumakubo, A; Munro, M; Sicheri, F; Gingras, AC; Natsume, T; Suda, T; Durocher, D",941.0,"[Panier, Stephanie; Al-Hakim, Abdallah; Juang, Yu-Chi; O'Donnell, Lara; Munro, Meagan; Sicheri, Frank; Gingras, Anne-Claude; Durocher, Daniel] Mt Sinai Hosp, Samuel Lunenfeld Res Inst, Toronto, ON M5G 1X5, Canada; [Nakada, Shinichiro; Tai, Ikue] Keio Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Integrated Med Res, Shinjuku Ku, Tokyo 1608582, Japan; [Nakada, Shinichiro; Tai, Ikue; Kumakubo, Ayako; Suda, Toshio] Keio Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Differentiat, Sakaguchi Lab Dev Biol,Shinjuku Ku, Tokyo 1608582, Japan; [Panier, Stephanie; Sicheri, Frank; Gingras, Anne-Claude; Durocher, Daniel] Univ Toronto, Dept Mol Genet, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [Iemura, Shun-ichiro; Natsume, Tohru] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Biomed Informat Res Ctr, Biol Syst Control Team, Koto Ku, Tokyo 1350064, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09297,Article,1476-4687,snakada@z3.keio.jp; durocher@lunenfeld.ca,U59,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) Japan; MEXT [21870033]; Takeda Science Foundation; Mitsubishi Pharma Research Foundation; Daiwa Anglo-Japanese Foundation; New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO); Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds; Canadian Institutes of Health Research [MOP10703115, MOP84314]","We are grateful to T.

109,60,162.0,"Innate immune defences are essential for the control of virus infection and are triggered through host recognition of viral macromolecular motifs known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)(1). Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an RNA virus that replicates in the liver, and infects 200 million people worldwide(2). Infection is regulated by hepatic immune defences triggered by the cellular RIG-I helicase. RIG-I binds PAMP RNA and signals interferon regulatory factor 3 activation to induce the expression of interferon-alpha/beta and antiviral/interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that limit infection(3-10). Here we identify the polyuridine motif of the HCV genome 3 ' non-translated region and its replication intermediate as the PAMP substrate of RIG-I, and show that this and similar homopolyuridine or homopolyriboadenine motifs present in the genomes of RNA viruses are the chief feature of RIG-I recognition and immune triggering in human and murine cells(8). 5 ' terminal triphosphate on the PAMP RNA was necessary but not sufficient for RIG-I binding, which was primarily dependent on homopolymeric ribonucleotide composition, linear structure and length. The HCV PAMP RNA stimulated RIG-I-dependent signalling to induce a hepatic innate immune response in vivo, and triggered interferon and ISG expression to suppress HCV infection in vitro. These results provide a conceptual advance by defining specific homopolymeric RNA motifs within the genome of HCV and other RNA viruses as the PAMP substrate of RIG-I, and demonstrate immunogenic features of the PAMP-RIG-I interaction that could be used as an immune adjuvant for vaccine and immunotherapy approaches.","Saito, Takeshi; Owen, David M.; Jiang, Fuguo; Marcotrigiano, Joseph; Gale, Michael, Jr.","Saito, T; Owen, DM; Jiang, FG; Marcotrigiano, J; Gale, M",523.0,"[Saito, Takeshi; Owen, David M.; Gale, Michael, Jr.] Univ Washington, Sch Med, Dept Immunol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Owen, David M.] Univ Texas Dallas, SW Med Ctr, Dept Microbiol, Dallas, TX 75235 USA; [Jiang, Fuguo; Marcotrigiano, Joseph] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07106,Article,,mgale@u.washington.edu,527,"NIAID NIH HHS [R01 AI060389, N01AI40035, R01 AI060389-01, R01 AI060389-02, R01 AI060389-03, R01 AI060389-04, R01 AI060389-05, R01 AI060389-06, R01 AI060389-07, R01 AI060389-08, R01 AI060389-09, R01AI060389, R56 AI060389, U19 AI040035, U19 AI040035-100004, U19 AI040035-110004, U19 AI040035-120004, U19 AI040035-130004, U19 AI040035-140004, U19AI40035]; NIDA NIH HHS [P01 DA021353, R01 DA024563, R01 DA024563-01, R01 DA024563-02, R01 DA024563-03, R01DA021353]",,329IC,Y,N,ANTIVIRAL RESPONSES; GENE-EXPRESSION; REPLICATION; TRANSLATION; ACTIVATION; INFECTION; RIBOSOME; HELICASE; ELEMENTS; PROTEIN,7203.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,"JIANG, FUGUO/0000-0003-4469-1803; Saito, Takeshi/0000-0002-6165-664X; Marcotrigiano, Joseph /0000-0003-0346-3353; Owen, David/0000-0002-5724-0342; Gale, Michael/0000-0002-6332-7436","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",24-Jul,5.0,LONDON,18548002.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,"JIANG, FUGUO/G-6581-2012; Saito, Takeshi/N-2788-2014; Marcotrigiano, Joseph /K-6697-2016","Gale, M (reprint author), Univ Washington, Sch Med, Dept Immunol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,406.0,Innate immunity induced by composition-dependent RIG-I recognition of hepatitis C virus RNA,0.0,24.0,WOS:000257860300053,162.0,454,Multidisciplinary Sciences,413,michael,gale,15118.0,11094,male,1.0,88ETbK0AAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",11458956,1,3346980,1,Michael Gale,Michael Gale,1,1
110,18,449.0,"Theoretical and empirical research highlights the role of punishment in promoting collaborative efforts(1-5). However, both the emergence and the stability of costly punishment are problematic issues. It is not clear how punishers can invade a society of defectors by social learning or natural selection, or how second-order free-riders (who contribute to the joint effort but not to the sanctions) can be prevented from drifting into a coercion-based regime and subverting cooperation. Here we compare the prevailing model of peer-punishment(6-8) with pool-punishment, which consists in committing resources, before the collaborative effort, to prepare sanctions against free-riders. Pool-punishment facilitates the sanctioning of second-order free-riders, because these are exposed even if everyone contributes to the common good. In the absence of such second-order punishment, peer-punishers do better than pool-punishers; but with second-order punishment, the situation is reversed. Efficiency is traded for stability. Neither other-regarding tendencies or preferences for reciprocity and equity, nor group selection or prescriptions from higher authorities, are necessary for the emergence and stability of rudimentary forms of sanctioning institutions regulating common pool resources and enforcing collaborative efforts.","Sigmund, Karl; De Silva, Hannelore; Traulsen, Arne; Hauert, Christoph","Sigmund, K; De Silva, H; Traulsen, A; Hauert, C",861.0,"[Sigmund, Karl] Univ Vienna, Fac Math, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Sigmund, Karl] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [De Silva, Hannelore] WU Vienna Univ Econ & Business, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Traulsen, Arne] Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Biol, D-24306 Plon, Germany; [Hauert, Christoph] Univ British Columbia, Dept Math, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09203,Article,,karl.sigmund@univie.ac.at,863,,,636TT,,,PUBLIC-GOODS GAMES; ALTRUISTIC PUNISHMENT; COSTLY PUNISHMENT; COOPERATION; EVOLUTION; RECIPROCITY; ADVANTAGE; SOCIETIES; HUMANS,7308.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,"Traulsen, Arne/0000-0002-0669-5267; Hauert, Christoph/0000-0002-1239-281X","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",12-Aug,3.0,LONDON,20631710.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2010.0,"Traulsen, Arne/A-4955-2009; Hauert, Christoph/E-5369-2011","Sigmund, K (reprint author), Univ Vienna, Fac Math, Waehringer Guertel 18, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,191.0,Social learning promotes institutions for governing the commons,3.0,76.0,WOS:000280766100035,449.0,466,Multidisciplinary Sciences,194,christoph,hauert,11574.0,192,male,1.0,cQR_dxAAAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
111,197,488.0,"The co-emergence of a six-layered cerebral neocortex and its corticospinal output system is one of the evolutionary hallmarks of mammals. However, the genetic programs that underlie their development and evolution remain poorly understood. Hereweidentify a conserved non-exonic element (E4) that acts as a cortex-specific enhancer for the nearby gene Fezf2 (also known as Fezl and Zfp312), which is required for the specification of corticospinal neuron identity and connectivity. We find that SOX4 and SOX11 functionally compete with the repressor SOX5 in the transactivation of E4. Cortex-specific double deletion of Sox4 and Sox11 leads to the loss of Fezf2 expression, failed specification of corticospinal neurons and, independent of Fezf2, a reeler-like inversion of layers. We show evidence supporting the emergence of functional SOX-binding sites in E4 during tetrapod evolution, and their subsequent stabilization in mammals and possibly amniotes. These findings reveal that SOX transcription factors converge onto a cis-acting element of Fezf2 and form critical components of a regulatory network controlling the identity and connectivity of corticospinal neurons.","Shim, Sungbo; Kwan, Kenneth Y.; Li, Mingfeng; Lefebvre, Veronique; Sestan, Nenad","Shim, SB; Kwan, KY; Li, MF; Lefebvre, V; Sestan, N",74.0,"[Shim, Sungbo; Kwan, Kenneth Y.; Li, Mingfeng; Sestan, Nenad] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Shim, Sungbo; Kwan, Kenneth Y.; Li, Mingfeng; Sestan, Nenad] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Kavli Inst Neurosci, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Lefebvre, Veronique] Cleveland Clin, Lerner Res Inst, Dept Cell Biol, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA; [Lefebvre, Veronique] Cleveland Clin, Lerner Res Inst, Orthopaed & Rheumatol Res Ctr, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11094,Article,,nenad.sestan@yale.edu,U177,"National Institutes of Health [NS054273, MH081896, AR54153]; March of Dimes Foundation; McDonnell Scholar Award","We thank W.

112,221,282.0,"The formation of the first massive objects in the infant Universe remains impossible to observe directly and yet it sets the stage for the subsequent evolution of galaxies(1-3). Although some black holes with masses more than 10(9) times that of the Sun have been detected in luminous quasars less than one billion years after the Big Bang(4,5), these individual extreme objects have limited utility in constraining the channels of formation of the earliest black holes; this is because the initial conditions of black hole seed properties are quickly erased during the growth process(6). Here we report a measurement of the amount of black hole growth in galaxies at redshift z = 6-8 (0.95-0.7 billion years after the Big Bang), based on optimally stacked, archival X-ray observations. Our results imply that black holes grow in tandem with their host galaxies throughout cosmic history, starting from the earliest times. We find that most copiously accreting black holes at these epochs are buried in significant amounts of gas and dust that absorb most radiation except for the highest-energy X-rays. This suggests that black holes grew significantly more during these early bursts than was previously thought, but because of the obscuration of their ultraviolet emission they did not contribute to the re-ionization of the Universe.","Treister, Ezequiel; Schawinski, Kevin; Volonteri, Marta; Natarajan, Priyamvada; Gawiser, Eric","Treister, E; Schawinski, K; Volonteri, M; Natarajan, P; Gawiser, E",356.0,"[Treister, Ezequiel] Univ Hawaii, Inst Astron, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Treister, Ezequiel] Univ Concepcion, Dept Astron, Concepcion, Chile; [Schawinski, Kevin; Natarajan, Priyamvada] Yale Ctr Astron & Astrophys, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Schawinski, Kevin; Natarajan, Priyamvada] Yale Univ, Dept Phys, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Volonteri, Marta] Univ Michigan, Dept Astron, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Natarajan, Priyamvada] Yale Univ, Dept Astron, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Natarajan, Priyamvada] Harvard Univ, Inst Theory & Computat, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Gawiser, Eric] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10103,Article,1476-4687,treister@ifa.hawaii.edu,358,,,777TD,,,ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; ULTRA DEEP FIELD; Z QUASAR SURVEY; LUMINOSITY FUNCTION; GALAXY FORMATION; REDSHIFT QUASARS; DISCOVERY; DENSITY; MODELS,7351.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,"Schawinski, Kevin/0000-0001-5464-0888; Treister, Ezequiel/0000-0001-7568-6412","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",16-Jun,3.0,LONDON,21677753.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2011.0,,"Treister, E (reprint author), Univ Hawaii, Inst Astron, 2680 Woodlawn Dr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,52.0,Black hole growth in the early Universe is self-regulated and largely hidden from view,1.0,3.0,WOS:000291647100040,282.0,474,Multidisciplinary Sciences,52,eric,gawiser,12277.0,4110,male,1.0,D5b2ctAAAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
113,133,309.0,"Meiotic recombination promotes genetic diversification as well as pairing and segregation of homologous chromosomes, but the double-strand breaks (DSBs) that initiate recombination are dangerous lesions that can cause mutation or meiotic failure. How cells control DSBs to balance between beneficial and deleterious outcomes is not well understood. Here we test the hypothesis that DSB control involves a network of intersecting negative regulatory circuits. Using multiple complementary methods, we show that DSBs form in greater numbers in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells lacking ZMM proteins, a suite of recombination-promoting factors traditionally regarded as acting strictly downstream of DSB formation. ZMM-dependent DSB control is genetically distinct from a pathway tying break formation to meiotic progression through the Ndt80 transcription factor. These counterintuitive findings suggest that homologous chromosomes that have successfully engaged one another stop making breaks. Genome-wide DSB maps uncover distinct responses by different subchromosomal domains to the ZMM mutation zip3 (also known as cst9), and show that Zip3 is required for the previously unexplained tendency of DSB density to vary with chromosome size. Thus, feedback tied to ZMM function contributes in unexpected ways to spatial patterning of recombination.","Thacker, Drew; Mohibullah, Neeman; Zhu, Xuan; Keeney, Scott","Thacker, D; Mohibullah, N; Zhu, X; Keeney, S",241.0,"[Thacker, Drew; Mohibullah, Neeman; Zhu, Xuan; Keeney, Scott] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Mol Biol Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Thacker, Drew; Zhu, Xuan; Keeney, Scott] Cornell Univ, Weill Grad Sch Med Sci, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Mohibullah, Neeman; Keeney, Scott] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10065 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13120,Article,1476-4687,s-keeney@ski.mskcc.org,+,National Institutes of Health [R01 GM058673],"We are grateful to S.

114,15,339.0,"X-ray tomography is an invaluable tool in biomedical imaging. It can deliver the three-dimensional internal structure of entire organisms as well as that of single cells, and even gives access to quantitative information, crucially important both for medical applications and for basic research(1-4). Most frequently such information is based on X-ray attenuation. Phase contrast is sometimes used for improved visibility but remains significantly harder to quantify(5,6). Here we describe an X-ray computed tomography technique that generates quantitative high-contrast three-dimensional electron density maps from phase contrast information without reverting to assumptions of a weak phase object or negligible absorption. This method uses a ptychographic coherent imaging approach to record tomographic data sets, exploiting both the high penetration power of hard X-rays and the high sensitivity of lensless imaging(7-9). As an example, we present images of a bone sample in which structures on the 100 nm length scale such as the osteocyte lacunae and the interconnective canalicular network are clearly resolved. The recovered electron density map provides a contrast high enough to estimate nanoscale bone density variations of less than one per cent. We expect this high-resolution tomography technique to provide invaluable information for both the life and materials sciences.","Dierolf, Martin; Menzel, Andreas; Thibault, Pierre; Schneider, Philipp; Kewish, Cameron M.; Wepf, Roger; Bunk, Oliver; Pfeiffer, Franz","Dierolf, M; Menzel, A; Thibault, P; Schneider, P; Kewish, CM; Wepf, R; Bunk, O; Pfeiffer, F",436.0,"[Dierolf, Martin; Thibault, Pierre; Pfeiffer, Franz] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Phys E17, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Menzel, Andreas; Kewish, Cameron M.; Bunk, Oliver] Paul Scherrer Inst, Swiss Light Source, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland; [Schneider, Philipp] ETH, Inst Biomech, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Wepf, Roger] EMEZ, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09419,Article,,pierre.thibault@tum.de,U82,"DFG Cluster of Excellence ""Munich-Centre for Advanced Photonics""","We acknowledge technical support by X.

115,42,52.0,"Maintenance of the blood system is dependent on dormant haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with long-term self-renewal capacity. After injury these cells are induced to proliferate to quickly reestablish homeostasis(1). The signalling molecules promoting the exit of HSCs out of the dormant stage remain largely unknown. Here we show that in response to treatment of mice with interferon-alpha (IFN alpha), HSCs efficiently exit G(0) and enter an active cell cycle. HSCs respond to IFN alpha treatment by the increased phosphorylation of STAT1 and PKB/Akt (also known as AKT1), the expression of IFN alpha target genes, and the upregulation of stem cell antigen-1 (Sca-1, also known as LY6A). HSCs lacking the IFN alpha/beta receptor (IFNAR)(2), STAT1 (ref. 3) or Sca-1 (ref. 4) are insensitive to IFN alpha stimulation, demonstrating that STAT1 and Sca-1 mediate IFN alpha-induced HSC proliferation. Although dormant HSCs are resistant to the anti-proliferative chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluoro-uracil(1,5), HSCs pre-treated (primed) with IFN alpha and thus induced to proliferate are efficiently eliminated by 5-fluoro-uracil exposure in vivo. Conversely, HSCs chronically activated by IFN alpha are functionally compromised and are rapidly out-competed by non-activatable Ifnar(-/-) cells in competitive repopulation assays. Whereas chronic activation of the IFN alpha pathway in HSCs impairs their function, acute IFN alpha treatment promotes the proliferation of dormant HSCs in vivo. These data may help to clarify the so far unexplained clinical effects of IFN alpha on leukaemic cells(6,7), and raise the possibility for new applications of type I interferons to target cancer stem cells(8).","Essers, Marieke A.

116,31,346.0,"A major goal of regenerative medicine is to instruct formation of multipotent, tissue-specific stem cells from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) for cell replacement therapies. Generation of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from iPSCs or embryonic stem cells (ESCs) is not currently possible, however, necessitating a better understanding of how HSCs normally arise during embryonic development. We previously showed that haematopoiesis occurs through four distinct waves during zebrafish development, with HSCs arising in the final wave in close association with the dorsal aorta. Recent reports have suggested that murine HSCs derive from haemogenic endothelial cells (ECs) lining the aortic floor(1,2). Additional in vitro studies have similarly indicated that the haematopoietic progeny of ESCs arise through intermediates with endothelial potential(3,4). Here we have used the unique strengths of the zebrafish embryo to image directly the generation of HSCs from the ventral wall of the dorsal aorta. Using combinations of fluorescent reporter transgenes, confocal time-lapse microscopy and flow cytometry, we have identified and isolated the stepwise intermediates as aortic haemogenic endothelium transitions to nascent HSCs. Finally, using a permanent lineage tracing strategy, we demonstrate that the HSCs generated from haemogenic endothelium are the lineal founders of the adult haematopoietic system.","Bertrand, Julien Y.; Chi, Neil C.; Santoso, Buyung; Teng, Shutian; Stainier, Didier Y.

117,217,209.0,"The basolateral amygdala (BLA) has a crucial role in emotional learning irrespective of valence(1-5,21-23). The BLA projection to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is thought to modulate cue-triggered motivated behaviours(4,6,7,24,25), but our understanding of the interaction between these two brain regions has been limited by the inability to manipulate neural-circuit elements of this pathway selectively during behaviour. To circumvent this limitation, we used in vivo optogenetic stimulation or inhibition of glutamatergic fibres from the BLA to the NAc, coupled with intracranial pharmacology and ex vivo electrophysiology. Here we show that optical stimulation of the pathway from the BLA to the NAc in mice reinforces behavioural responding to earn additional optical stimulation of these synaptic inputs. Optical stimulation of these glutamatergic fibres required intra-NAc dopamine D1-type receptor signalling, but not D2-type receptor signalling. Brief optical inhibition of fibres from the BLA to the NAc reduced cue-evoked intake of sucrose, demonstrating an important role of this specific pathway in controlling naturally occurring reward-related behaviour. Moreover, although optical stimulation of glutamatergic fibres from the medial prefrontal cortex to the NAc also elicited reliable excitatory synaptic responses, optical self-stimulation behaviour was not observed by activation of this pathway. These data indicate that whereas the BLA is important for processing both positive and negative affect, the glutamatergic pathway from the BLA to the NAc, in conjunction with dopamine signalling in the NAc, promotes motivated behavioural responding. Thus, optogenetic manipulation of anatomically distinct synaptic inputs to the NAc reveals functionally distinct properties of these inputs in controlling reward-seeking behaviours.","Stuber, Garret D.; Sparta, Dennis R.; Stamatakis, Alice M.; van Leeuwen, Wieke A.; Hardjoprajitno, Juanita E.; Cho, Saemi; Tye, Kay M.; Kempadoo, Kimberly A.; Zhang, Feng; Deisseroth, Karl; Bonci, Antonello","Stuber, GD; Sparta, DR; Stamatakis, AM; van Leeuwen, WA; Hardjoprajitno, JE; Cho, S; Tye, KM; Kempadoo, KA; Zhang, F; Deisseroth, K; Bonci, A",377.0,"[Stuber, Garret D.; Sparta, Dennis R.; Stamatakis, Alice M.] Univ N Carolina, UNC Neurosci Ctr, Dept Psychiat, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Stuber, Garret D.; Sparta, Dennis R.; Stamatakis, Alice M.] Univ N Carolina, UNC Neurosci Ctr, Dept Cell & Mol Physiol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Stuber, Garret D.; Sparta, Dennis R.; van Leeuwen, Wieke A.; Hardjoprajitno, Juanita E.; Cho, Saemi; Tye, Kay M.; Kempadoo, Kimberly A.; Bonci, Antonello] Univ Calif San Francisco, Wheeler Ctr Neurobiol Drug Addict, Dept Neurol, Ernest Gallo Clin & Res Ctr, San Francisco, CA 94608 USA; [Tye, Kay M.; Zhang, Feng; Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Tye, Kay M.; Zhang, Feng; Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Dept Bioengn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Bonci, Antonello] NIDA, Intramural Res Program, Baltimore, MD 21224 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10194,Article,,gstuber@med.unc.edu,U129,NARSAD; ABMRF; Foundation of Hope; NIDA [DA029325]; Psychiatry Department at UNC Chapel Hill; State of California through the University of California at San Francisco;  [F32AA018610],"We thank J.

118,125,130.0,"In BRAF(V600)-mutant tumours, most mechanisms of resistance to drugs that target the BRAF and/or MEK kinases rely on reactivation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction pathway, on activation of the alternative, PI(3) K-AKT-mTOR, pathway (which is ERK independent) or on modulation of the caspase-dependent apoptotic cascade(1-3). All three pathways converge to regulate the formation of the eIF4F eukaryotic translation initiation complex, which binds to the 7-methylguanylate cap (m(7)G) at the 59 end of messenger RNA, thereby modulating the translation of specific mRNAs(4,5). Here we show that the persistent formation of the eIF4F complex, comprising the eIF4E cap-binding protein, the eIF4G scaffolding protein and the eIF4A RNA helicase, is associated with resistance to anti-BRAF, anti-MEK and anti-BRAF plus anti-MEK drug combinations in BRAF(V600)-mutant melanoma, colon and thyroid cancer cell lines. Resistance to treatment and maintenance of eIF4F complex formation is associated with one of three mechanisms: reactivation of MAPK signalling, persistent ERK-independent phosphorylation of the inhibitory eIF4E-binding protein 4EBP1 or increased pro-apoptotic BCL-2-modifying factor (BMF)-dependent degradation of eIF4G. The development of an in situ method to detect the eIF4E-eIF4G interactions shows that eIF4F complex formation is decreased in tumours that respond to anti-BRAF therapy and increased in resistant metastases compared to tumours before treatment. Strikingly, inhibiting the eIF4F complex, either by blocking the eIF4E-eIF4G interaction or by targeting eIF4A, synergizes with inhibiting BRAF(V600) to kill the cancer cells. eIF4F not only appears to be an indicator of both innate and acquired resistance but also is a promising therapeutic target. Combinations of drugs targeting BRAF(and/or MEK) and eIF4F may overcome most of the resistance mechanisms arising in BRAF(V600)-mutant cancers.","Boussemart, Lise; Malka-Mahieu, Helene; Girault, Isabelle; Allard, Delphine; Hemmingsson, Oskar; Tomasic, Gorana; Thomas, Marina; Basmadjian, Christine; Ribeiro, Nigel; Thuaud, Frederic; Mateus, Christina; Routier, Emilie; Kamsu-Kom, Nyam; Agoussi, Sandrine; Eggermont, Alexander M.; Desaubry, Laurent; Robert, Caroline; Vagner, Stephan","Boussemart, L; Malka-Mahieu, H; Girault, I; Allard, D; Hemmingsson, O; Tomasic, G; Thomas, M; Basmadjian, C; Ribeiro, N; Thuaud, F; Mateus, C; Routier, E; Kamsu-Kom, N; Agoussi, S; Eggermont, AM; Desaubry, L; Robert, C; Vagner, S",105.0,"[Boussemart, Lise; Malka-Mahieu, Helene; Girault, Isabelle; Allard, Delphine; Hemmingsson, Oskar; Kamsu-Kom, Nyam; Agoussi, Sandrine; Robert, Caroline; Vagner, Stephan] Inserm UMR981, F-94805 Villejuif, France; [Boussemart, Lise; Malka-Mahieu, Helene; Eggermont, Alexander M.; Robert, Caroline; Vagner, Stephan] Univ Paris 11, F-94276 Le Kremlin Bicetre, France; [Boussemart, Lise; Thomas, Marina; Mateus, Christina; Routier, Emilie; Eggermont, Alexander M.; Robert, Caroline; Vagner, Stephan] Gustave Roussy, Dermatooncol, F-94805 Villejuif, France; [Tomasic, Gorana] Gustave Roussy, Dept Pathol, F-94805 Villejuif, France; [Basmadjian, Christine; Ribeiro, Nigel; Thuaud, Frederic; Desaubry, Laurent] Strasbourg Univ, CNRS, UMR7200, F-67400 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature13572,Article,1476-4687,caroline.robert@gustaveroussy.fr; stephan.vagner@inserm.fr,+,Institut National du CAncer (INCA); Association pour la Recherche sur le Cancer (ARC); Ligue contre le Cancer via an Integrated Research Action Program Melanoma (PAIR Melanome); Canceropole Ile de France and Ensemble Contre le Melanome; ARC; AAREC Filia Research for fellowships; Wenner-Gren Foundation; Swedish Society of Medicine,"The authors thank J.

119,180,480.0,"Cyclostomes, the living jawless vertebrates including hagfishes and lampreys, represent the most basal lineage of vertebrates. Although the monophyly of cyclostomes has been supported by recent molecular analyses, the phenotypic traits of hagfishes, especially the lack of some vertebrate-defining features and the reported endodermal origin of the adenohypophysis, have been interpreted as hagfishes exhibiting a more ancestral state than those of all other vertebrates. Furthermore, the adult anatomy of hagfishes cannot be compared easily with that of lampreys. Here we describe the craniofacial development of a series of staged hagfish embryos, which shows that their adenohypophysis arises ectodermally, consistent with the molecular phylogenetic data. This finding also allowed us to identify a pan-cyclostome pattern, one not shared by jawed vertebrates. Comparative analyses indicated that many of the hagfish-specific traits can be explained by changes secondarily introduced into the hagfish lineage. We also propose a possibility that the pan-cyclostome pattern may reflect the ancestral programme for the craniofacial development of all living vertebrates.","Oisi, Yasuhiro; Ota, Kinya G.; Kuraku, Shigehiro; Fujimoto, Satoko; Kuratani, Shigeru","Oisi, Y; Ota, KG; Kuraku, S; Fujimoto, S; Kuratani, S",175.0,"[Oisi, Yasuhiro] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biol, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan; [Oisi, Yasuhiro; Fujimoto, Satoko; Kuratani, Shigeru] RIKEN Ctr Dev Biol, Lab Evolutionary Morphol, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan; [Ota, Kinya G.] Acad Sinica, Inst Cellular & Organism Biol, Marine Res Stn, Yilan 26242, Taiwan; [Kuraku, Shigehiro] RIKEN Ctr Dev Biol, Genome Resource & Anal Unit, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11794,Article,1476-4687,saizo@cdb.riken.jp,180,,,066YY,,,LETHENTERON-JAPONICUM; BDELLOSTOMA STOUTI; LAMPETRA-JAPONICA; TRIGEMINAL NERVE; NEURAL CREST; GENES; EXPRESSION; LAMPREYS; ADENOHYPOPHYSIS; ORGANIZATION,7431.0,NATURE,Nature,English,50.0,No,"Kuratani, Shigeru/0000-0001-9717-7221; ","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",10-Jan,6.0,LONDON,23254938.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2013.0,"Kuratani, Shigeru/J-4146-2014; Kuraku, Shigehiro/B-2801-2009","Kuratani, S (reprint author), RIKEN Ctr Dev Biol, Lab Evolutionary Morphol, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,45.0,Craniofacial development of hagfishes and the evolution of vertebrates,3.0,112.0,WOS:000313259600030,480.0,493,Multidisciplinary Sciences,51,shigeru,kuratani,9413.0,3,male,1.0,_UKuUx8AAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",3338527,1,3338527,1,Cyclostomata,Cyclostomata,0,0
120,73,479.0,"The thermal structure of the crust strongly influences deformation, metamorphism and plutonism(1-3). Models for the geothermal gradient in stable crust predict a steady increase of temperature with depth. This thermal structure, however, is incompatible with observations from high- temperature metamorphic terranes exhumed in orogens(1,4,5,6). Global compilations(7) of peak conditions in high- temperature metamorphic terranes define relatively narrow ranges of peak temperatures over a wide range in pressure, for both isothermal decompression and isobaric cooling paths. Here we develop simple one- dimensional thermal models that include the effects of melt migration. These models show that long- lived plutonism results in a quasi- steady- state geotherm with a rapid temperature increase in the upper crust and nearly isothermal conditions in the middle and lower crust. The models also predict that the upward advection of heat by melt generates granulite facies metamorphism, and widespread andalusite - sillimanite metamorphism in the upper crust. Once the quasi- steady- state thermal profile is reached, the middle and lower crust are greatly weakened due to high temperatures and anatectic conditions, thus setting the stage for gravitational collapse(8), exhumation and isothermal decompression after the onset of plutonism. Near- iso-thermal conditions in the middle and lower crust result from the thermal buffering effect of dehydration melting reactions that, in part, control the shape of the geotherm.","Depine, Gabriela V.; Andronicos, Christopher L.; Phipps-Morgan, Jason","Depine, GV; Andronicos, CL; Phipps-Morgan, J",80.0,"[Depine, Gabriela V.; Andronicos, Christopher L.; Phipps-Morgan, Jason] Cornell Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06689,Article,1476-4687,gvd2@cornell.edu,83,,,269SZ,,,THERMAL-PROCESSES; BRITISH-COLUMBIA; OROGENIC BELTS; GRANITE; FLOW; METAMORPHISM; EMPLACEMENT; MOUNTAINS; ANATEXIS; SOLIDUS,7183.0,NATURE,Nature,English,34.0,No,,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",6-Mar,4.0,LONDON,18322532.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,,"Depine, GV (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Snee Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,34.0,Near-isothermal conditions in the middle and lower crust induced by melt migration,2.0,19.0,WOS:000253671900050,479.0,452,Multidisciplinary Sciences,34,jason,phipps-morgan,9583.0,4927,male,1.0,D2TRutgAAAAJ,4,"(9345, 17929]",45641474,1,673711,1,Morgan (2016 film),Morgan (2016 film),0,0

Yet a third of fish stocks worldwide are overexploited or depleted(1,2). Using individual case studies, many have argued that community-based co-management(3) should prevent the tragedy of the commons(4) because cooperative management by fishers, managers and scientists often results in sustainable fisheries(3,5,6). However, general and multidisciplinary evaluations of co-management regimes and the conditions for social, economic and ecological success within such regimes are lacking. Here we examine 130 co-managed fisheries in a wide range of countries with different degrees of development, ecosystems, fishing sectors and type of resources. We identified strong leadership as the most important attribute contributing to success, followed by individual or community quotas, social cohesion and protected areas. Less important conditions included enforcement mechanisms, long-term management policies and life history of the resources. Fisheries were most successful when at least eight co-management attributes were present, showing a strong positive relationship between the number of these attributes and success, owing to redundancy in management regulations. Our results demonstrate the critical importance of prominent community leaders and robust social capital(7), combined with clear incentives through catch shares and conservation benefits derived from protected areas, for successfully managing aquatic resources and securing the livelihoods of communities depending on them. Our study offers hope that co-management, the only realistic solution for the majority of the world's fisheries, can solve many of the problems facing global fisheries.","Gutierrez, Nicolas L.; Hilborn, Ray; Defeo, Omar","Gutierrez, NL; Hilborn, R; Defeo, O",386.0,"[Gutierrez, Nicolas L.; Hilborn, Ray] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Defeo, Omar] Fac Ciencias, UNDECIMAR, Montevideo 11400, Uruguay",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09689,Article,,nicolasg@uw.edu,389,National Science Foundation [0308440]; Fulbright-OAS Initiative in Ecology; Pew Charitable Trusts,"N.L.G. was partially funded by the National Science Foundation (award 0308440) and a Fulbright-OAS Initiative in Ecology fellowship.

122,375,477.0,"The Hubble Deep Field provides one of the deepest multiwave-length views of the distant Universe and has led to the detection of thousands of galaxies seen throughout cosmic time(1). An early map of the Hubble Deep Field at a wavelength of 850 micrometres, which is sensitive to dust emission powered by star formation, revealed the brightest source in the field, dubbed HDF 850.1 (ref. 2). For more than a decade, and despite significant efforts, no counterpart was found at shorter wavelengths, and it was not possible to determine its redshift, size or mass(3-7). Here we report a redshift of z = 5.183 for HDF 850.1, from a millimetre-wave molecular line scan. This places HDF 850.1 in a galaxy overdensity at z approximate to 5.2, corresponding to a cosmic age of only 1.1 billion years after the Big Bang. This redshift is significantly higher than earlier estimates(3,4,6,8) and higher than those of most of the hundreds of submillimetre-bright galaxies identified so far. The source has a star-formation rate of 850 solar masses per year and is spatially resolved on scales of 5 kiloparsecs, with an implied dynamical mass of about 1.3 x 10(11) solar masses, a significant fraction of which is present in the form of molecular gas. Despite our accurate determination of redshift and position, a counterpart emitting starlight remains elusive.","Walter, Fabian; Decarli, Roberto; Carilli, Chris; Bertoldi, Frank; Cox, Pierre; Da Cunha, Elisabete; Daddi, Emanuele; Dickinson, Mark; Downes, Dennis; Elbaz, David; Ellis, Richard; Hodge, Jacqueline; Neri, Roberto; Riechers, Dominik A.; Weiss, Axel; Bell, Eric; Dannerbauer, Helmut; Krips, Melanie; Krumholz, Mark; Lentati, Lindley; Maiolino, Roberto; Menten, Karl; Rix, Hans-Walter; Robertson, Brant; Spinrad, Hyron; Stark, Dan P.; Stern, Daniel","Walter, F; Decarli, R; Carilli, C; Bertoldi, F; Cox, P; Da Cunha, E; Daddi, E; Dickinson, M; Downes, D; Elbaz, D; Ellis, R; Hodge, J; Neri, R; Riechers, DA; Weiss, A; Bell, E; Dannerbauer, H; Krips, M; Krumholz, M; Lentati, L; Maiolino, R; Menten, K; Rix, HW; Robertson, B; Spinrad, H; Stark, DP; Stern, D",233.0,"[Walter, Fabian; Decarli, Roberto; Da Cunha, Elisabete; Hodge, Jacqueline; Rix, Hans-Walter] Max Planck Inst Astron, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Walter, Fabian; Carilli, Chris] Natl Radio Astron Observ, Pete V Domenici Array Sci Ctr, Socorro, NM 87801 USA; [Carilli, Chris; Lentati, Lindley; Maiolino, Roberto] Univ Cambridge, Cavendish Lab, Cambridge CB3 0HE, England; [Bertoldi, Frank] Univ Bonn, Argelander Inst Astron, D-53121 Bonn, Germany; [Cox, Pierre; Downes, Dennis; Neri, Roberto; Krips, Melanie] IRAM, F-38406 St Martin Dheres, France; [Da Cunha, Elisabete; Elbaz, David] Univ Paris Diderot, Lab AIM, CEA, DSM,CNRS,Irfu Serv Astrophys,CEA Saclay, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Dickinson, Mark] Natl Opt Astron Observ, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA; [Ellis, Richard; Riechers, Dominik A.] CALTECH, Dept Astron, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Weiss, Axel; Menten, Karl] Max Planck Inst Radioastron, D-53121 Bonn, Germany; [Bell, Eric] Univ Michigan, Dept Astron, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Dannerbauer, Helmut] Univ Vienna, Inst Astron, A-1080 Vienna, Austria; [Krumholz, Mark] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Astron & Astrophys, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Maiolino, Roberto] INAF Osservatorio Astron Roma, I-00040 Monte Porzio Catone, Italy; [Robertson, Brant; Stark, Dan P.] Univ Arizona, Dept Astron, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Spinrad, Hyron] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Astron, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Stern, Daniel] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11073,Article,1476-4687,walter@mpia.de,236,MPG (Germany); INSU/CNRS (France); IGN (Spain); NASA; DLR [FKZ 50OR1004],"This work is based on observations carried out with the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer.

123,38,115.0,"The three-dimensional structures of proteins often show a modular architecture comprised of discrete structural regions or domains. Cooperative communication between these regions is important for catalysis, regulation and efficient folding; lack of coupling has been implicated in the formation of fibrils and other misfolding pathologies(1). How different structural regions of a protein communicate and contribute to a protein's overall energetics and folding, however, is still poorly understood. Here we use a single-molecule optical tweezers approach to induce the selective unfolding of particular regions of T4 lysozyme and monitor the effect on other regions not directly acted on by force. We investigate how the topological organization of a protein (the order of structural elements along the sequence) affects the coupling and folding cooperativity between its domains. To probe the status of the regions not directly subjected to force, we determine the free energy changes during mechanical unfolding using Crooks' fluctuation theorem. We pull on topological variants (circular permutants) and find that the topological organization of the polypeptide chain critically determines the folding cooperativity between domains and thus what parts of the folding/unfolding landscape are explored. We speculate that proteins may have evolved to select certain topologies that increase coupling between regions to avoid areas of the landscape that lead to kinetic trapping and misfolding.","Shank, Elizabeth A.; Cecconi, Ciro; Dill, Jesse W.; Marqusee, Susan; Bustamante, Carlos","Shank, EA; Cecconi, C; Dill, JW; Marqusee, S; Bustamante, C",637.0,"[Shank, Elizabeth A.; Cecconi, Ciro; Marqusee, Susan; Bustamante, Carlos] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Shank, Elizabeth A.; Cecconi, Ciro; Dill, Jesse W.; Marqusee, Susan; Bustamante, Carlos] Univ Calif Berkeley, Inst Quantitat Biosci, Jason L Choy Lab Single Mol Biophys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Dill, Jesse W.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Biophys Grad Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Bustamante, Carlos] Univ Calif Berkeley, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Bustamante, Carlos] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Bustamante, Carlos] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09021,Article,,Marqusee@berkeley.edu; Carlos@alice.berkeley.edu,U134,"NIH [GM 32543, GM 50945]; NSF","We would like to thank G.

124,301,73.0,"Major international projects are underway that are aimed at creating a comprehensive catalogue of all the genes responsible for the initiation and progression of cancer(1-9). These studies involve the sequencing of matched tumour-normal samples followed by mathematical analysis to identify those genes in which mutations occur more frequently than expected by random chance. Here we describe a fundamental problem with cancer genome studies: as the sample size increases, the list of putatively significant genes produced by current analytical methods burgeons into the hundreds. The list includes many implausible genes (such as those encoding olfactory receptors and the muscle protein titin), suggesting extensive false-positive findings that overshadow true driver events. We show that this problem stems largely from mutational heterogeneity and provide a novel analytical methodology, MutSigCV, for resolving the problem. We apply MutSigCV to exome sequences from 3,083 tumour-normal pairs and discover extraordinary variation in mutation frequency and spectrum within cancer types, which sheds light on mutational processes and disease aetiology, and in mutation frequency across the genome, which is strongly correlated with DNA replication timing and also with transcriptional activity. By incorporating mutational heterogeneity into the analyses, MutSigCV is able to eliminate most of the apparent artefactual findings and enable the identification of genes truly associated with cancer.","Lawrence, Michael S.; Stojanov, Petar; Polak, Paz; Kryukov, Gregory V.; Cibulskis, Kristian; Sivachenko, Andrey; Carter, Scott L.; Stewart, Chip; Mermel, Craig H.; Roberts, Steven A.; Kiezun, Adam; Hammerman, Peter S.; McKenna, Aaron; Drier, Yotam; Zou, Lihua; Ramos, Alex H.; Pugh, Trevor J.; Stransky, Nicolas; Helman, Elena; Kim, Jaegil; Sougnez, Carrie; Ambrogio, Lauren; Nickerson, Elizabeth; Shefler, Erica; Cortes, Maria L.; Auclair, Daniel; Saksena, Gordon; Voet, Douglas; Noble, Michael; DiCara, Daniel; Lin, Pei; Lichtenstein, Lee; Heiman, David I.; Fennell, Timothy; Imielinski, Marcin; Hernandez, Bryan; Hodis, Eran; Baca, Sylvan; Dulak, Austin M.; Lohr, Jens; Landau, Dan-Avi; Wu, Catherine J.; Melendez-Zajgla, Jorge; Hidalgo-Miranda, Alfredo; Koren, Amnon; McCarroll, Steven A.; Mora, Jaume; Lee, Ryan S.; Crompton, Brian; Onofrio, Robert; Parkin, Melissa; Winckler, Wendy; Ardlie, Kristin; Gabriel, Stacey B.; Roberts, Charles W.

125,119,71.0,"Quantum communication is a method that offers efficient and secure ways for the exchange of information in a network. Large- scale quantum communication(1-4) ( of the order of 100 km) has been achieved; however, serious problems occur beyond this distance scale, mainly due to inevitable photon loss in the transmission channel. Quantum communication eventually fails(5) when the probability of a dark count in the photon detectors becomes comparable to the probability that a photon is correctly detected. To overcome this problem, Briegel, Dur, Cirac and Zoller ( BDCZ) introduced the concept of quantum repeaters(6), combining entanglement swapping(7) and quantum memory to efficiently extend the achievable distances. Although entanglement swapping has been experimentally demonstrated(8), the implementation of BDCZ quantum repeaters has proved challenging owing to the difficulty of integrating a quantum memory. Here we realize entanglement swapping with storage and retrieval of light, a building block of the BDCZ quantum repeater. We follow a scheme(9,10) that incorporates the strategy of BDCZ with atomic quantum memories(11). Two atomic ensembles, each originally entangled with a single emitted photon, are projected into an entangled state by performing a joint Bell state measurement on the two single photons after they have passed through a 300- m fibre- based communication channel. The entanglement is stored in the atomic ensembles and later verified by converting the atomic excitations into photons. Our method is intrinsically phase insensitive and establishes the essential element needed to realize quantum repeaters with stationary atomic qubits as quantum memories and flying photonic qubits as quantum messengers.","Yuan, Zhen-Sheng; Chen, Yu-Ao; Zhao, Bo; Chen, Shuai; Schmiedmayer, Joerg; Pan, Jian-Wei","Yuan, ZS; Chen, YA; Zhao, B; Chen, S; Schmiedmayer, J; Pan, JW",1098.0,"[Yuan, Zhen-Sheng; Chen, Yu-Ao; Zhao, Bo; Chen, Shuai; Pan, Jian-Wei] Univ Heidelberg, Inst Phys, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Yuan, Zhen-Sheng; Chen, Yu-Ao; Pan, Jian-Wei] Univ Sci & Technol China, Hefei Natl Lab Phys Sci Microscale, Anhua 230026, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Zhen-Sheng; Chen, Yu-Ao; Pan, Jian-Wei] Univ Sci & Technol China, Dept Modern Phys, Anhua 230026, Peoples R China; [Schmiedmayer, Joerg] Vienna Univ Technol, Atominst Osterreichischen Univ, A-1020 Vienna, Austria",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07241,Article,,yuao@physi.uni-heidelberg.de; jian-wei.pan@physi.uni-heidelberg.de,1101,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation; Marie Curie Excellence Grant; ERC Grant; National Fundamental Research Program [2006CB921900]; CAS; NNSFC","We thank W.

Here we present the completely sequenced and annotated spider mite genome, representing the first complete chelicerate genome. At 90 megabases T. urticae has the smallest sequenced arthropod genome. Compared with other arthropods, the spider mite genome shows unique changes in the hormonal environment and organization of the Hox complex, and also reveals evolutionary innovation of silk production. We find strong signatures of polyphagy and detoxification in gene families associated with feeding on different hosts and in new gene families acquired by lateral gene transfer.

127,19,340.0,"Ever since the conversion of the 11-cis retinal chromophore to its all-trans form in rhodopsin was identified as the primary photochemical event in vision(1), experimentalists and theoreticians have tried to unravel the molecular details of this process. The high quantum yield of 0.65 (ref. 2), the production of the primary ground-state rhodopsin photoproduct within a mere 200 fs (refs 3-7), and the storage of considerable energy in the first stable bathorhodopsin intermediate(8) all suggest an unusually fast and efficient photoactivated one-way reaction(9). Rhodopsin's unique reactivity is generally attributed to a conical intersection between the potential energy surfaces of the ground and excited electronic states(10,11) enabling the efficient and ultrafast conversion of photon energy into chemical energy(12-16). But obtaining direct experimental evidence for the involvement of a conical intersection is challenging: the energy gap between the electronic states of the reacting molecule changes significantly over an ultrashort time-scale, which calls for observational methods that combine high temporal resolution with a broad spectral observation window. Here we show that ultrafast optical spectroscopy with sub-20-fs time resolution and spectral coverage from the visible to the near-infrared allows us to follow the dynamics leading to the conical intersection in rhodopsin isomerization. We track coherent wave-packet motion from the photoexcited Franck-Condon region to the photoproduct by monitoring the loss of reactant emission and the subsequent appearance of photoproduct absorption, and find excellent agreement between the experimental observations and molecular dynamics calculations that involve a true electronic state crossing. Taken together, these findings constitute the most compelling evidence to date for the existence and importance of conical intersections in visual photochemistry.","Polli, Dario; Altoe, Piero; Weingart, Oliver; Spillane, Katelyn M.; Manzoni, Cristian; Brida, Daniele; Tomasello, Gaia; Orlandi, Giorgio; Kukura, Philipp; Mathies, Richard A.; Garavelli, Marco; Cerullo, Giulio","Polli, D; Altoe, P; Weingart, O; Spillane, KM; Manzoni, C; Brida, D; Tomasello, G; Orlandi, G; Kukura, P; Mathies, RA; Garavelli, M; Cerullo, G",440.0,"[Altoe, Piero; Tomasello, Gaia; Orlandi, Giorgio; Garavelli, Marco] Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Chim G Ciamician, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Polli, Dario; Manzoni, Cristian; Brida, Daniele; Cerullo, Giulio] Politecn Milan, IFN, CNR, Dipartimento Fis, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Weingart, Oliver] Univ Duisburg Essen, Lehrstuhl Theoret Chem, D-45117 Essen, Germany; [Weingart, Oliver] Max Planck Inst Kohlenforsch, D-45470 Mulheim, Germany; [Spillane, Katelyn M.; Mathies, Richard A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kukura, Philipp] Univ Oxford, Dept Chem, Phys & Theoret Chem Lab, Oxford OX1 3QZ, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09346,Article,,marco.garavelli@unibo.it; giulio.cerullo@fisi.polimi.it,U88,DFG [FOR490]; PRIN programme [2008JKBBK4]; UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/H003541/1],"M.G., O.W., G.O., G.

128,194,114.0,"Antimicrobial peptides (AmPs) are small proteins that are used by the innate immune system to combat bacterial infection in multicellular eukaryotes(1). There is mounting evidence that these peptides are less susceptible to bacterial resistance than traditional antibiotics and could form the basis for a new class of therapeutic agents(2). Here we report the rational design of new AmPs that show limited homology to naturally occurring proteins but have strong bacteriostatic activity against several species of bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus anthracis. These peptides were designed using a linguistic model of natural AmPs: we treated the amino-acid sequences of natural AmPs as a formal language and built a set of regular grammars to describe this language. We used this set of grammars to create new, unnatural AmP sequences. Our peptides conform to the formal syntax of natural antimicrobial peptides but populate a previously unexplored region of protein sequence space.","Loose, Christopher; Jensen, Kyle; Rigoutsos, Isidore; Stephanopoulos, Gregory","Loose, C; Jensen, K; Rigoutsos, I; Stephanopoulos, G",867.0,"MIT, Dept Chem Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Harvard MIT Div Hlth Sci & Technol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Agrivida, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; IBM Corp, Div Res, Thomas J Watson Res Ctr, Yorktown Hts, NY 10598 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature05233,Article,,gregstep@mit.edu,869,,,096FJ,,,SEQUENCES; MEMBRANE; DATABASE,7113.0,NATURE,Nature,English,19.0,No,"Rigoutsos, Isidore/0000-0003-1529-8631","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",19-Oct,3.0,LONDON,17051220.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2006.0,,"Stephanopoulos, G (reprint author), MIT, Dept Chem Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,99.0,A linguistic model for the rational design of antimicrobial peptides,4.0,36.0,WOS:000241362700054,114.0,443,Multidisciplinary Sciences,106,gregory,stephanopoulos,34176.0,721,male,1.0,S-DzIpYAAAAJ,5,"(17929, ]",429665,1,18302078,1,George Stephanopoulos,George Stephanopoulos,1,1

130,325,444.0,"Genetic and biochemical analyses of RNA interference (RNAi) and microRNA (miRNA) pathways have revealed proteins such as Argonaute and Dicer as essential cofactors that process and present small RNAs to their targets. Well-validated small RNA pathway cofactors such as these show distinctive patterns of conservation or divergence in particular animal, plant, fungal and protist species. We compared 86 divergent eukaryotic genome sequences to discern sets of proteins that show similar phylogenetic profiles with known small RNA cofactors. A large set of additional candidate small RNA cofactors have emerged from functional genomic screens for defects in miRNA-or short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated repression in Caenorhabditis elegans and Dro-sophila melanogaster(1,2), and from proteomic analyses of proteins co-purifying with validated small RNA pathway proteins(3,4). The phylogenetic profiles of many of these candidate small RNA pathway proteins are similar to those of known small RNA cofactor proteins. We used a Bayesian approach to integrate the phylogenetic profile analysis with predictions from diverse transcriptional coregulation and proteome interaction data sets to assign a probability for each protein for a role in a small RNA pathway. Testing high-confidence candidates from this analysis for defects in RNAi silencing, we found that about one-half of the predicted small RNA cofactors are required for RNAi silencing. Many of the newly identified small RNA pathway proteins are orthologues of proteins implicated in RNA splicing. In support of a deep connection between the mechanism of RNA splicing and small-RNA-mediated gene silencing, the presence of the Argonaute proteins and other small RNA components in the many species analysed strongly correlates with the number of introns in those species.","Tabach, Yuval; Billi, Allison C.; Hayes, Gabriel D.; Newman, Martin A.; Zuk, Or; Gabel, Harrison; Kamath, Ravi; Yacoby, Keren; Chapman, Brad; Garcia, Susana M.; Borowsky, Mark; Kim, John K.; Ruvkun, Gary","Tabach, Y; Billi, AC; Hayes, GD; Newman, MA; Zuk, O; Gabel, H; Kamath, R; Yacoby, K; Chapman, B; Garcia, SM; Borowsky, M; Kim, JK; Ruvkun, G",694.0,"[Tabach, Yuval; Hayes, Gabriel D.; Newman, Martin A.; Gabel, Harrison; Kamath, Ravi; Yacoby, Keren; Chapman, Brad; Garcia, Susana M.; Borowsky, Mark; Ruvkun, Gary] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Mol Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Tabach, Yuval; Hayes, Gabriel D.; Newman, Martin A.; Gabel, Harrison; Kamath, Ravi; Garcia, Susana M.; Borowsky, Mark; Ruvkun, Gary] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Billi, Allison C.; Kim, John K.] Univ Michigan, Inst Life Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Billi, Allison C.; Kim, John K.] Univ Michigan, Dept Human Genet, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Zuk, Or] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11779,Article,,ruvkun@molbio.mgh.harvard.edu,698,"NIH [GM088565, GM44619, GM098647]; Pew Charitable Trusts","We thank T.

131,223,301.0,"The sudden appearance of the neural crest and neurogenic placodes in early branching vertebrates has puzzled biologists for over a century(1). These embryonic tissues contribute to the development of the cranium and associated sensory organs, which were crucial for the evolution of the vertebrate ""new head""(2,3). Aprevious study suggests that rudimentary neural crest cells existed in ancestral chordates(4). However, the evolutionary origins of neurogenic placodes have remained obscure owing to a paucity of embryonic data from tunicates, the closest living relatives to those early vertebrates(5). Here we show that the tunicate Ciona intestinalis exhibits a proto-placodal ectoderm (PPE) that requires inhibition of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and expresses the key regulatory determinant Six1/ 2 and its co-factor Eya, a developmental process conserved across vertebrates. The Ciona PPE is shown to produce ciliated neurons that express genes for gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), a G-protein-coupled receptor for relaxin-3 (RXFP3) and a functional cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (CNGA), which suggests dual chemosensory and neurosecretory activities. These observations provide evidence that Ciona has a neurogenic proto-placode, which forms neurons that appear to be related to those derived from the olfactory placode and hypothalamic neurons of vertebrates.

132,366,392.0,"During progression of atherosclerosis, myeloid cells destabilize lipid-rich plaques in the arterial wall and cause their rupture, thus triggering myocardial infarction and stroke. Survivors of acute coronary syndromes have a high risk of recurrent events for unknown reasons. Here we show that the systemic response to ischaemic injury aggravates chronic atherosclerosis. After myocardial infarction or stroke, Apoe(-/-) mice developed larger atherosclerotic lesions with a more advanced morphology. This disease acceleration persisted over many weeks and was associated with markedly increased monocyte recruitment. Seeking the source of surplus monocytes in plaques, we found that myocardial infarction liberated haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from bone marrow niches via sympathetic nervous system signalling. The progenitors then seeded the spleen, yielding a sustained boost in monocyte production. These observations provide new mechanistic insight into atherogenesis and provide a novel therapeutic opportunity to mitigate disease progression.","Dutta, Partha; Courties, Gabriel; Wei, Ying; Leuschner, Florian; Gorbatov, Rostic; Robbins, Clinton S.; Iwamoto, Yoshiko; Thompson, Brian; Carlson, Alicia L.; Heidt, Timo; Majmudar, Maulik D.; Lasitschka, Felix; Etzrodt, Martin; Waterman, Peter; Waring, Michael T.; Chicoine, Adam T.; van der Laan, Anja M.; Niessen, Hans W.

133,72,431.0,"Using next-generation sequencing technology alone, we have successfully generated and assembled a draft sequence of the giant panda genome. The assembled contigs (2.25 gigabases (Gb)) cover approximately 94% of the whole genome, and the remaining gaps (0.05 Gb) seem to contain carnivore-specific repeats and tandem repeats. Comparisons with the dog and human showed that the panda genome has a lower divergence rate. The assessment of panda genes potentially underlying some of its unique traits indicated that its bamboo diet might be more dependent on its gut microbiome than its own genetic composition. We also identified more than 2.7 million heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms in the diploid genome. Our data and analyses provide a foundation for promoting mammalian genetic research, and demonstrate the feasibility for using next-generation sequencing technologies for accurate, cost-effective and rapid de novo assembly of large eukaryotic genomes.","Li, Ruiqiang;

134,230,400.0,"Lipid mediators influence immunity in myriad ways. For example, circulating sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a key regulator of lymphocyte egress(1,2). Although the majority of plasma S1P is bound to apolipoprotein M (ApoM) in the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particle(3), the immunological functions of the ApoM-S1P complex are unknown. Here we show that ApoM-S1P is dispensable for lymphocyte trafficking yet restrains lymphopoiesis by activating the S1P1 receptor on bone marrow lymphocyte progenitors. Mice that lacked ApoM (Apom(-/-)) had increased proliferation of Lin(-) Sca-1(+) cKit(+) haematopoietic progenitor cells (LSKs) and common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs) in bone marrow. Pharmacological activation or genetic overexpression of S1P(1) suppressed LSK and CLP cell proliferation in vivo. ApoM was stably associated with bone marrow CLPs, which showed active S1P(1) signalling in vivo(4). Moreover, ApoM-bound S1P, but not albumin-bound S1P, inhibited lymphopoiesis in vitro. Upon immune stimulation, Apom(-/-) mice developed more severe experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis5, characterized by increased lymphocytes in the central nervous system and breakdown of the blood-brain barrier. Thus, the ApoM-S1P-S1P(1) signalling axis restrains the lymphocyte compartment and, subsequently, adaptive immune responses. Unique biological functions imparted by specific S1P chaperones could be exploited for novel therapeutic opportunities.","Blaho, Victoria A.; Galvani, Sylvain; Engelbrecht, Eric; Liu, Catherine; Swendeman, Steven L.; Kono, Mari; Proia, Richard L.; Steinman, Lawrence; Han, May H.; Hla, Timothy","Blaho, VA; Galvani, S; Engelbrecht, E; Liu, C; Swendeman, SL; Kono, M; Proia, RL; Steinman, L; Han, MH; Hla, T",342.0,"[Blaho, Victoria A.; Galvani, Sylvain; Engelbrecht, Eric; Liu, Catherine; Swendeman, Steven L.; Hla, Timothy] Cornell Univ, Weill Med Coll, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Ctr Vasc Biol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Blaho, Victoria A.; Hla, Timothy] Cornell Univ, Weill Med Coll, Brain & Mind Res Inst, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Kono, Mari; Proia, Richard L.] NIDDK, Genet Dev & Dis Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Steinman, Lawrence; Han, May H.] Stanford Univ, Dept Neurol & Neurol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature14462,Article,1476-4687,tih2002@med.cornell.edu,+,"National Institutes of Health (NIH) [F32 CA14211]; New York Stem Cell Foundation [C026878]; NIH, Fondation Leducq [HL67330, HL70694, HL89934]; Intramural program of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, NIH; Fondation Leducq; Lipidomics Shared Resource, Hollings Cancer Center, Medical University of South Carolina [P30 CA138313]; Lipidomics Core in the SC Lipidomics and Pathobiology COBRE [P20 RR017677]","The authors thank C.

135,308,203.0,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) show differential expression across breast cancer subtypes, and have both oncogenic and tumour-suppressive roles(1-6). Here we report the miRNA expression profiles of 1,302 breast tumours with matching detailed clinical annotation, long-term follow-up and genomic and messenger RNA expression data(7). This provides a comprehensive overview of the quantity, distribution and variation of the miRNA population and provides information on the extent to which genomic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional events contribute to miRNA expression architecture, suggesting an important role for post-transcriptional regulation. The key clinical parameters and cellular pathways related to the miRNA landscape are characterized, revealing context-dependent interactions, for example with regards to cell adhesion and Wnt signalling. Notably, only prognostic miRNA signatures derived from breast tumours devoid of somatic copy-number aberrations (CNA-devoid) are consistently prognostic across several other subtypes and can be validated in external cohorts. We then use a data-driven approach(8) to seek the effects of miRNAs associated with differential co-expression of mRNAs, and find that miRNAs act as modulators of mRNA-mRNA interactions rather than as on-off molecular switches. We demonstrate such an important modulatory role for miRNAs in the biology of CNA-devoid breast cancers, a common subtype in which the immune response is prominent. These findings represent a new framework for studying the biology of miRNAs in human breast cancer.","Dvinge, Heidi; Git, Anna; Graef, Stefan; Salmon-Divon, Mali; Curtis, Christina; Sottoriva, Andrea; Zhao, Yongjun; Hirst, Martin; Armisen, Javier; Miska, Eric A.; Chin, Suet-Feung; Provenzano, Elena; Turashvili, Gulisa; Green, Andrew; Ellis, Ian; Aparicio, Sam; Caldas, Carlos","Dvinge, H; Git, A; Graf, S; Salmon-Divon, M; Curtis, C; Sottoriva, A; Zhao, YJ; Hirst, M; Armisen, J; Miska, EA; Chin, SF; Provenzano, E; Turashvili, G; Green, A; Ellis, I; Aparicio, S; Caldas, C",378.0,"[Dvinge, Heidi; Git, Anna; Graef, Stefan; Chin, Suet-Feung; Caldas, Carlos] Canc Res UK Cambridge Inst, Cambridge CB2 0RE, England; [Dvinge, Heidi; Git, Anna; Graef, Stefan; Chin, Suet-Feung; Caldas, Carlos] Univ Cambridge, Li Ka Shing Ctr, Dept Oncol, Cambridge CB2 0RE, England; [Salmon-Divon, Mali] European Bioinformat Inst, European Mol Biol Lab, Cambridge CB10 1SD, England; [Salmon-Divon, Mali] Ariel Univ, Ctr Samaria, Dept Mol Biol, IL-40700 Ariel, Israel; [Curtis, Christina; Sottoriva, Andrea] Univ So Calif, Dept Prevent Med, Los Angeles, CA 90033 USA; [Zhao, Yongjun; Hirst, Martin] BC Canc Agcy, Genome Sci Ctr, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada; [Zhao, Yongjun; Hirst, Martin; Turashvili, Gulisa; Aparicio, Sam] Univ British Columbia, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Vancouver, BC V6T 2B5, Canada; [Armisen, Javier; Miska, Eric A.] Univ Cambridge, Wellcome Trust Canc Res UK Gurdon Inst, Cambridge CB2 1QN, England; [Armisen, Javier; Miska, Eric A.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Biochem, Cambridge CB2 1QN, England; [Provenzano, Elena; Caldas, Carlos] Cambridge Univ Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Addenbrookes Hosp, Cambridge Breast Unit, Cambridge CB2 2QQ, England; [Provenzano, Elena; Caldas, Carlos] NIHR Cambridge Biomed Res Ctr, Cambridge CB2 2QQ, England; [Turashvili, Gulisa; Aparicio, Sam] British Columbia Canc Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada; [Green, Andrew; Ellis, Ian] Univ Nottingham, Sch Mol Med Sci, Dept Histopathol, Nottingham NG5 1PB, England; [Caldas, Carlos] Cambridge Expt Canc Med Ctr, Cambridge CB2 0RE, England",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12108,Article,,anna.git@cruk.cam.ac.uk; saparicio@bccrc.ca; carlos.caldas@cruk.cam.ac.uk,382,Cancer Research UK; British Columbia Cancer Foundation; University of Cambridge; Hutchinson Whampoa; NIHR Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre; Cambridge Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre,"The study was funded by Cancer Research UK and the British Columbia Cancer Foundation.

136,127,278.0,"Obesity is increasing in an epidemic manner in most countries and constitutes a public health problem by enhancing the risk for cardiovascular disease and metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes(1,2). Owing to the increase in obesity, life expectancy may start to decrease in developed countries for the first time in recent history(3). The factors determining fat mass in adult humans are not fully understood, but increased lipid storage in already developed fat cells ( adipocytes) is thought to be most important(4,5). Here we show that adipocyte number is a major determinant for the fat mass in adults. However, the number of fat cells stays constant in adulthood in lean and obese individuals, even after marked weight loss, indicating that the number of adipocytes is set during childhood and adolescence. To establish the dynamics within the stable population of adipocytes in adults, we have measured adipocyte turnover by analysing the integration of C-14 derived from nuclear bomb tests in genomic DNA(6). Approximately 10% of fat cells are renewed annually at all adult ages and levels of body mass index. Neither adipocyte death nor generation rate is altered in early onset obesity, suggesting a tight regulation of fat cell number in this condition during adulthood. The high turnover of adipocytes establishes a new therapeutic target for pharmacological intervention in obesity.","Spalding, Kirsty L.; Arner, Erik; Westermark, Pal O.; Bernard, Samuel; Buchholz, Bruce A.; Bergmann, Olaf; Blomqvist, Lennart; Hoffstedt, Johan; Naslund, Erik; Britton, Tom; Concha, Hernan; Hassan, Moustapha; Ryden, Mikael; Frisen, Jonas; Arner, Peter","Spalding, KL; Arner, E; Westermark, PO; Bernard, S; Buchholz, BA; Bergmann, O; Blomqvist, L; Hoffstedt, J; Naslund, E; Britton, T; Concha, H; Hassan, M; Ryden, M; Frisen, J; Arner, P",783.0,"[Spalding, Kirsty L.; Arner, Erik; Bergmann, Olaf; Frisen, Jonas] Karolinska Inst, Dept Cell & Mol Biol, SE-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Westermark, Pal O.] Humboldt Univ, ITB, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Westermark, Pal O.] Charite, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Bernard, Samuel] Fdn Res & Technol, Inst Appl & Computat Math, Iraklion 71110, Greece; [Buchholz, Bruce A.] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Ctr Accelerator Mass Spectrometry, Livermore, CA 94551 USA; [Blomqvist, Lennart; Hoffstedt, Johan; Concha, Hernan; Hassan, Moustapha; Ryden, Mikael; Arner, Peter] Karolinska Univ Hosp, Dept Med, SE-14186 Stockholm, Sweden; [Naslund, Erik] Karolinska Inst, Div Surg, Dept Clin Sci, Danderyd Hosp, SE-18288 Stockholm, Sweden; [Britton, Tom] Stockholm Univ, Dept Math, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06902,Article,1476-4687,kirsty.spalding@ki.se; jonas.frisen@ki.se; peter.arner@ki.se,787,"NCRR NIH HHS [RR13461, P41 RR013461]",,308UK,Y,N,ADIPOSE-TISSUE CELLULARITY; MECHANISMS LINKING OBESITY; NUCLEAR TESTS; ADIPOCYTES; DISEASE; NUMBER; SIZE; C-14; AGE,7196.0,NATURE,Nature,English,30.0,No,"Bergmann, Olaf/0000-0003-1065-4107; Arner, Erik/0000-0003-1225-4908; Bernard, Samuel/0000-0002-8442-9968; Hassan, Moustapha/0000-0003-1927-5859; Westermark, Pal/0000-0002-6637-2566","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",5-Jun,5.0,LONDON,18454136.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,"Bergmann, Olaf/A-5706-2009; Arner, Erik/A-1895-2010; Bernard, Samuel/A-5623-2009; Buchholz, Bruce/G-1356-2011; Hassan, Moustapha/H-9260-2015; spalding, kirsty/I-6046-2017","Spalding, KL (reprint author), Karolinska Inst, Dept Cell & Mol Biol, SE-17177 Stockholm, Sweden.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,958.0,Dynamics of fat cell turnover in humans,7.0,123.0,WOS:000256415300044,278.0,453,Multidisciplinary Sciences,985,peter,arner,46829.0,4373,male,1.0,6ReQCkkAAAAJ,5,"(17929, ]",na,0,na,0,na,na,0,0
137,422,271.0,"More than half of the world's population now lives in cities, making the creation of a healthy urban environment amajor policy priority(1). Cities have both health risks and benefits(1), but mental health is negatively affected: mood and anxiety disorders are more prevalent in city dwellers(2) and the incidence of schizophrenia is strongly increased in people born and raised in cities(3-6). Although these findings have been widely attributed to the urban social environment(2,3,7,8), the neural processes that could mediate such associations are unknown. Here we show, using functional magnetic resonance imaging in three independent experiments, that urban upbringing and city living have dissociable impacts on social evaluative stress processing in humans. Current city living was associated with increased amygdala activity, whereas urban upbringing affected the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex, a key region for regulation of amygdala activity, negative affect(9) and stress(10). These findings were regionally and behaviourally specific, as no other brain structures were affected and no urbanicity effect was seen during control experiments invoking cognitive processing without stress. Our results identify distinct neural mechanisms for an established environmental risk factor, link the urban environment for the first time to social stress processing, suggest that brain regions differ in vulnerability to this risk factor across the lifespan, and indicate that experimental interrogation of epidemiological associations is a promising strategy in social neuroscience.","Lederbogen, Florian; Kirsch, Peter; Haddad, Leila; Streit, Fabian; Tost, Heike; Schuch, Philipp; Wuest, Stefan; Pruessner, Jens C.; Rietschel, Marcella; Deuschle, Michael; Meyer-Lindenberg, Andreas","Lederbogen, F; Kirsch, P; Haddad, L; Streit, F; Tost, H; Schuch, P; Wust, S; Pruessner, JC; Rietschel, M; Deuschle, M; Meyer-Lindenberg, A",498.0,"[Lederbogen, Florian; Kirsch, Peter; Haddad, Leila; Streit, Fabian; Tost, Heike; Schuch, Philipp; Wuest, Stefan; Rietschel, Marcella; Deuschle, Michael; Meyer-Lindenberg, Andreas] Univ Heidelberg, Cent Inst Mental Hlth, Fac Med, D-68159 Mannheim, Germany; [Pruessner, Jens C.] McGill Univ, Douglas Mental Hlth Univ Inst, Verdun, PQ H4H 1R3, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10190,Article,,a.meyer-lindenberg@zi-mannheim.de,501,European Community [HEALTH-F2-2010-241909]; German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) [SFB 636-B7]; Federal Ministry of Education and Research (MooDS),"We thank D.

138,158,141.0,"NUMB is a cell fate determinant, which, by asymmetrically partitioning at mitosis, controls cell fate choices by antagonising the activity of the plasma membrane receptor of the NOTCH family(1). NUMB is also an endocytic protein(2), and the NOTCH-NUMB counteraction has been linked to this function(3,4). There might be, however, additional functions of NUMB, as witnessed by its proposed role as a tumour suppressor in breast cancer(5). Here we describe a previously unknown function for human NUMB as a regulator of tumour protein p53 ( also known as TP53). NUMB enters in a tricomplex with p53 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase HDM2( also known as MDM2), thereby preventing ubiquitination and degradation of p53. This results in increased p53 protein levels and activity, and in regulation of p53- dependent phenotypes. In breast cancers there is frequent loss of NUMB expression(5). We show that, in primary breast tumour cells, this event causes decreased p53 levels and increased chemoresistance. In breast cancers, loss of NUMB expression causes increased activity of the receptor NOTCH5. Thus, in these cancers, a single event - loss of NUMB expression - determines activation of an oncogene ( NOTCH) and attenuation of the p53 tumour suppressor pathway. Biologically, this results in an aggressive tumour phenotype, as witnessed by findings that NUMB- defective breast tumours display poor prognosis. Our results uncover a previously unknown tumour suppressor circuitry.","Colaluca, Ivan N.; Tosoni, Daniela; Nuciforo, Paolo; Senic-Matuglia, Francesca; Galimberti, Viviana; Viale, Giuseppe; Pece, Salvatore; Di Fiore, Pier Paolo","Colaluca, IN; Tosoni, D; Nuciforo, P; Senic-Matuglia, F; Galimberti, V; Viale, G; Pece, S; Di Fiore, PP",76.0,"[Colaluca, Ivan N.; Tosoni, Daniela; Nuciforo, Paolo; Senic-Matuglia, Francesca; Pece, Salvatore; Di Fiore, Pier Paolo] FIRC Inst Mol Oncol Fdn, IFOM, I-20139 Milan, Italy; [Colaluca, Ivan N.; Tosoni, Daniela; Galimberti, Viviana; Viale, Giuseppe; Pece, Salvatore; Di Fiore, Pier Paolo] European Inst Oncol, I-20141 Milan, Italy; [Viale, Giuseppe; Pece, Salvatore; Di Fiore, Pier Paolo] Univ Milan, Dipartimento Med Chirurg & Odontoiatria, I-20122 Milan, Italy",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06412,Article,,salvatore.pece@ifom-ieo-campus.it; pierpaolo.difiore@ifom-ieo-campus.it,U11,Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro,,247KZ,,,ASYMMETRIC CELL-DIVISION; BREAST-CANCER; NEGATIVE REGULATION; ENDOCYTIC PROTEIN; ALPHA-ADAPTIN; HISTONE H2AX; STEM-CELLS; MDM2; EXPRESSION; GENE,7174.0,NATURE,Nature,English,32.0,No,"Pece, Salvatore/0000-0003-1764-3929; Di Fiore, Pier Paolo/0000-0002-2252-0950; Nuciforo, Paolo/0000-0003-1380-0990","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",3-Jan,6.0,LONDON,18172499.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2008.0,"Pece, Salvatore/B-9609-2013; Tosoni, Daniela/K-4524-2014; Di Fiore, Pier Paolo/K-2130-2012","Pece, S (reprint author), FIRC Inst Mol Oncol Fdn, IFOM, Via Adamello 16, I-20139 Milan, Italy.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,211.0,NUMB controls p53 tumour suppressor activity,0.0,22.0,WOS:000252079300037,141.0,451,Multidisciplinary Sciences,239,pier paolo,di fiore,31841.0,3,male,1.0,Gm7qnecAAAAJ,5,"(17929, ]",220884,1,168255,1,Florence Cathedral,Florence Cathedral,0,0
139,435,448.0,"Members of the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily have important functions in immunity and inflammation. Recently linear ubiquitin chains assembled by a complex containing HOIL-1 and HOIP (also known as RBCK1 and RNF31, respectively) were implicated in TNF signalling, yet their relevance in vivo remained uncertain. Here we identify SHARPIN as a third component of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex, recruited to the CD40 and TNF receptor signalling complexes together with its other constituents, HOIL-1 and HOIP. Mass spectrometry of TNF signalling complexes revealed RIP1 (also known as RIPK1) and NEMO (also known as IKK gamma or IKBKG) to be linearly ubiquitinated. Mutation of the Sharpin gene (Sharpin(cpdm/cpdm)) causes chronic proliferative dermatitis (cpdm) characterized by inflammatory skin lesions and defective lymphoid organogenesis. Gene induction by TNF, CD40 ligand and interleukin-1 beta was attenuated in cpdm-derived cells which were rendered sensitive to TNF-induced death. Importantly, Tnf gene deficiency prevented skin lesions in cpdm mice. We conclude that by enabling linear ubiquitination in the TNF receptor signalling complex, SHARPIN interferes with TNF-induced cell death and, thereby, prevents inflammation. Our results provide evidence for the relevance of linear ubiquitination in vivo in preventing inflammation and regulating immune signalling.","Gerlach, Bjoern; Cordier, Stefanie M.; Schmukle, Anna C.; Emmerich, Christoph H.; Rieser, Eva; Haas, Tobias L.; Webb, Andrew I.; Rickard, James A.; Anderton, Holly; Wong, Wendy W-L.; Nachbur, Ueli; Gangoda, Lahiru; Warnken, Uwe; Purcell, Anthony W.; Silke, John; Walczak, Henning","Gerlach, B; Cordier, SM; Schmukle, AC; Emmerich, CH; Rieser, E; Haas, TL; Webb, AI; Rickard, JA; Anderton, H; Wong, WWL; Nachbur, U; Gangoda, L; Warnken, U; Purcell, AW; Silke, J; Walczak, H",591.0,"[Gerlach, Bjoern; Cordier, Stefanie M.; Schmukle, Anna C.; Emmerich, Christoph H.; Rieser, Eva; Walczak, Henning] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Med, Tumour Immunol Unit, London W12 0NN, England; [Gerlach, Bjoern; Emmerich, Christoph H.; Haas, Tobias L.; Walczak, Henning] German Canc Res Ctr, Div Apoptosis Regulat, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Haas, Tobias L.] Mediterranean Inst Oncol, Dept Expt Oncol, I-95029 Viagrande, Italy; [Webb, Andrew I.; Purcell, Anthony W.] Bio21 Melbourne Univ, Dept Biochem, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Rickard, James A.; Anderton, Holly; Wong, Wendy W-L.; Nachbur, Ueli; Gangoda, Lahiru; Silke, John] La Trobe Univ, Dept Biochem, Melbourne, Vic 3086, Australia; [Warnken, Uwe] German Canc Res Ctr, Prot Anal Core Facil, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature09816,Article,,h.walczak@imperial.ac.uk,+,"Cancer Research UK; AICR; BBSRC (ERASysBio PLUS); Ovarian Cancer Action; EU; NHMRC [541901, 541902, 602516]; HGF/SBCancer; Schweizer Nationalfonds (SNF)","We thank M.

140,426,339.0,"Molecular replacement(1-4) procedures, which search for placements of a starting model within the crystallographic unit cell that best account for the measured diffraction amplitudes, followed by automatic chain tracing methods(5-8), have allowed the rapid solution of large numbers of protein crystal structures. Despite extensive work(9-14), molecular replacement or the subsequent rebuilding usually fail with more divergent starting models based on remote homologues with less than 30% sequence identity. Here we show that this limitation can be substantially reduced by combining algorithms for protein structure modelling with those developed for crystallographic structure determination. An approach integrating Rosetta structure modelling with Autobuild chain tracing yielded high-resolution structures for 8 of 13 X-ray diffraction data sets that could not be solved in the laboratories of expert crystallographers and that remained unsolved after application of an extensive array of alternative approaches. We estimate that the new method should allow rapid structure determination without experimental phase information for over half the cases where current methods fail, given diffraction data sets of better than 3.2 angstrom resolution, four or fewer copies in the asymmetric unit, and the availability of structures of homologous proteins with >20% sequence identity.","DiMaio, Frank; Terwilliger, Thomas C.; Read, Randy J.; Wlodawer, Alexander; Oberdorfer, Gustav; Wagner, Ulrike; Valkov, Eugene; Alon, Assaf; Fass, Deborah; Axelrod, Herbert L.; Das, Debanu; Vorobiev, Sergey M.; Iwai, Hideo; Pokkuluri, P.

141,300,6.0,"The HeLa cell line was established in 1951 from cervical cancer cells taken from a patient, Henrietta Lacks. This was the first successful attempt to immortalize human-derived cells in vitro(1). The robust growth and unrestricted distribution of HeLa cells resulted in its broad adoption-both intentionally and through widespread cross-contamination(2)-and for the past 60 years it has served a role analogous to that of a model organism(3). The cumulative impact of the HeLa cell line on research is demonstrated by its occurrence in more than 74,000 PubMed abstracts (approximately 0.3%). The genomic architecture of HeLa remains largely unexplored beyond its karyotype(4), partly because like many cancers, its extensive aneuploidy renders such analyses challenging. We carried out haplotype-resolved whole-genome sequencing(5) of the HeLa CCL-2 strain, examined point-and indel-mutation variations, mapped copy-number variations and loss of heterozygosity regions, and phased variants across full chromosome arms. We also investigated variation and copy-number profiles for HeLa S3 and eight additional strains. We find that HeLa is relatively stable in terms of point variation, with few new mutations accumulating after early passaging. Haplotype resolution facilitated reconstruction of an amplified, highly rearranged region of chromosome 8q24.21 at which integration of the human papilloma virus type 18 (HPV-18) genome occurred and that is likely to be the event that initiated tumorigenesis. We combined these maps with RNA-seq(6) and ENCODE Project(7) data sets to phase the HeLa epigenome. This revealed strong, haplotype-specific activation of the proto-oncogene MYC by the integrated HPV-18 genome approximately 500 kilobases upstream, and enabled global analyses of the relationship between gene dosage and expression. These data provide an extensively phased, high-quality reference genome for past and future experiments relying on HeLa, and demonstrate the value of haplotype resolution for characterizing cancer genomes and epigenomes.","Adey, Andrew; Burton, Joshua N.; Kitzman, Jacob O.; Hiatt, Joseph B.; Lewis, Alexandra P.; Martin, Beth K.; Qiu, Ruolan; Lee, Choli; Shendure, Jay","Adey, A; Burton, JN; Kitzman, JO; Hiatt, JB; Lewis, AP; Martin, BK; Qiu, RL; Lee, C; Shendure, J",207.0,"[Adey, Andrew; Burton, Joshua N.; Kitzman, Jacob O.; Hiatt, Joseph B.; Lewis, Alexandra P.; Martin, Beth K.; Qiu, Ruolan; Lee, Choli; Shendure, Jay] Univ Washington, Dept Genome Sci, Seattle, WA 98115 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature12064,Article,1476-4687,acadey@uw.edu; shendure@uw.edu,+,National Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) [HG006283]; National Cancer Institute [CA160080]; National Science Foundation [DGE-0718124]; NHGRI [T32HG000035]; National Institute of Aging [AG039173],"The genome sequence described in this paper was derived from a HeLa cell line.

142,351,212.0,"Assessment and characterization of gut microbiota has become a major research area in human disease, including type 2 diabetes, the most prevalent endocrine disease worldwide. To carry out analysis on gut microbial content in patients with type 2 diabetes, we developed a protocol for a metagenome-wide association study (MGWAS) and undertook a two-stage MGWAS based on deep shotgun sequencing of the gut microbial DNA from 345 Chinese individuals. We identified and validated approximately 60,000 type-2-diabetes-associated markers and established the concept of a metagenomic linkage group, enabling taxonomic species-level analyses. MGWAS analysis showed that patients with type 2 diabetes were characterized by a moderate degree of gut microbial dysbiosis, a decrease in the abundance of some universal butyrate-producing bacteria and an increase in various opportunistic pathogens, as well as an enrichment of other microbial functions conferring sulphate reduction and oxidative stress resistance. An analysis of 23 additional individuals demonstrated that these gut microbial markers might be useful for classifying type 2 diabetes.","Qin, Junjie; Li, Yingrui; Cai, Zhiming; Li, Shenghui; Zhu, Jianfeng; Zhang, Fan; Liang, Suisha; Zhang, Wenwei; Guan, Yuanlin; Shen, Dongqian; Peng, Yangqing; Zhang, Dongya; Jie, Zhuye; Wu, Wenxian; Qin, Youwen; Xue, Wenbin; Li, Junhua; Han, Lingchuan; Lu, Donghui; Wu, Peixian; Dai, Yali; Sun, Xiaojuan; Li, Zesong; Tang, Aifa; Zhong, Shilong; Li, Xiaoping; Chen, Weineng; Xu, Ran; Wang, Mingbang; Feng, Qiang; Gong, Meihua; Yu, Jing; Zhang, Yanyan; Zhang, Ming; Hansen, Torben; Sanchez, Gaston; Raes, Jeroen; Falony, Gwen; Okuda, Shujiro; Almeida, Mathieu; LeChatelier, Emmanuelle; Renault, Pierre; Pons, Nicolas; Batto, Jean-Michel; Zhang, Zhaoxi; Chen, Hua; Yang, Ruifu; Zheng, Weimou; Li, Songgang; Yang, Huanming; Wang, Jian; Ehrlich, S.

143,215,132.0,"Studies of individual living cells have revealed that many transcription factors activate in dynamic, and often stochastic, pulses within the same cell. However, it has remained unclear whether cells might exploit the dynamic interaction of these pulses to control gene expression. Here, using quantitative single-cell time-lapse imaging of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we show that the pulsatile transcription factors Msn2 and Mig1 combinatorially regulate their target genes through modulation of their relative pulse timing. The activator Msn2 and repressor Mig1 showed pulsed activation in either a temporally overlapping or non-overlapping manner during their transient response to different inputs, with only the non-overlapping dynamics efficiently activating target gene expression. Similarly, under constant environmental conditions, where Msn2 and Mig1 exhibit sporadic pulsing, glucose concentration modulated the temporal overlap between pulses of the two factors. Together, these results reveal a time-based mode of combinatorial gene regulation. Regulation through relative signal timing is common in engineering and neurobiology, and these results suggest that it could also function broadly within the signalling and regulatory systems of the cell.","Lin, Yihan; Sohn, Chang Ho; Dalal, Chiraj K.; Cai, Long; Elowitz, Michael B.","Lin, YH; Sohn, CH; Dalal, CK; Cai, L; Elowitz, MB",54.0,"[Lin, Yihan; Dalal, Chiraj K.; Elowitz, Michael B.] CALTECH, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Lin, Yihan; Dalal, Chiraj K.; Elowitz, Michael B.] CALTECH, Div Biol & Biol Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Sohn, Chang Ho; Cai, Long] CALTECH, Div Chem & Chem Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA",,,11/19/17,,10.1038/nature15710,Article,1476-4687,melowitz@caltech.edu,58,"NIH [R01 GM079771B, R01 GM086793A]; NSF [1547056]; DARPA [HR0011-05-1-0057]; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation [GBMF2809]; Ellison foundation","We thank U.

144,53,291.0,"Although mammalian hearts show almost no ability to regenerate, there is a growing initiative to determine whether existing cardiomyocytes or progenitor cells can be coaxed into eliciting a regenerative response. In contrast to mammals, several non-mammalian vertebrate species are able to regenerate their hearts(1-3), including the zebrafish(4,5), which can fully regenerate its heart after amputation of up to 20% of the ventricle. To address directly the source of newly formed cardiomyocytes during zebrafish heart regeneration, we first established a genetic strategy to trace the lineage of cardiomyocytes in the adult fish, on the basis of the Cre/lox system widely used in the mouse(6). Here we use this system to show that regenerated heart muscle cells are derived from the proliferation of differentiated cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, we show that proliferating cardiomyocytes undergo limited dedifferentiation characterized by the disassembly of their sarcomeric structure, detachment from one another and the expression of regulators of cell-cycle progression. Specifically, we show that the gene product of polo-like kinase 1 (plk1) is an essential component of cardiomyocyte proliferation during heart regeneration. Our data provide the first direct evidence for the source of proliferating cardiomyocytes during zebrafish heart regeneration and indicate that stem or progenitor cells are not significantly involved in this process.","Jopling, Chris; Sleep, Eduard; Raya, Marina; Marti, Merce; Raya, Angel; Izpisua Belmonte, Juan Carlos","Jopling, C; Sleep, E; Raya, M; Marti, M; Raya, A; Belmonte, JCI",606.0,"[Jopling, Chris; Sleep, Eduard; Raya, Marina; Marti, Merce; Raya, Angel; Izpisua Belmonte, Juan Carlos] Ctr Regenerat Med Barcelona, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Sleep, Eduard; Raya, Angel; Izpisua Belmonte, Juan Carlos] Networking Ctr Biomed Res Bioengn Biomat & Nanome, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Raya, Angel] ICREA, Barcelona 08010, Spain; [Izpisua Belmonte, Juan Carlos] Salk Inst Biol Studies, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature08899,Article,,belmonte@salk.edu,U168,"Ministry of Innovation, Universities and Enterprise (DIUE), Generalitat de Catalunya; Fundacion Cellex; Ipsen Foundation; G.

145,400,442.0,"The radiation of the mammals provides a 165-million-year test case for evolutionary theories of how species occupy and then fill ecological niches. It is widely assumed that species often diverge rapidly early in their evolution, and that this is followed by a longer, drawn-out period of slower evolutionary fine-tuning as natural selection fits organisms into an increasingly occupied niche space(1,2). But recent studies have hinted that the process may not be so simple(3-5). Here we apply statistical methods that automatically detect temporal shifts in the rate of evolution through time to a comprehensive mammalian phylogeny(6) and data set(7) of body sizes of 3,185 extant species. Unexpectedly, the majority of mammal species, including two of the most speciose orders (Rodentia and Chiroptera), have no history of substantial and sustained increases in the rates of evolution. Instead, a subset of the mammals has experienced an explosive increase (between 10- and 52-fold) in the rate of evolution along the single branch leading to the common ancestor of their monophyletic group (for example Chiroptera), followed by a quick return to lower or background levels. The remaining species are a taxonomically diverse assemblage showing a significant, sustained increase or decrease in their rates of evolution. These results necessarily decouple morphological diversification from speciation and suggest that the processes that give rise to the morphological diversity of a class of animals are far more free to vary than previously considered. Niches do not seem to fill up, and diversity seems to arise whenever, wherever and at whatever rate it is advantageous.","Venditti, Chris; Meade, Andrew; Pagel, Mark","Venditti, C; Meade, A; Pagel, M",393.0,"[Venditti, Chris] Univ Hull, Dept Biol Sci, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England; [Meade, Andrew; Pagel, Mark] Univ Reading, Sch Biol Sci, Reading RG6 6BX, Berks, England; [Pagel, Mark] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature10516,Article,,c.venditti@hull.ac.uk; m.pagel@reading.ac.uk,396,"Leverhulme Trust [ECF/2009/0029]; Natural Environment Research Council, UK; European Research Council","This research was supported by a Leverhulme Trust Early Career Fellowship (ECF/2009/0029) to C.

146,263,441.0,"Epithelial folding mediated by apical constriction converts flat epithelial sheets into multilayered, complex tissue structures and is used throughout development inmost animals(1). Little is known, however, about how forces produced near the apical surface of the tissue are transmitted within individual cells to generate the global changes in cell shape that characterize tissue deformation. Here we apply particle tracking velocimetry in gastrulating Drosophila embryos to measure the movement of cytoplasm and plasma membrane during ventral furrow formation(2,3). We find that cytoplasmic redistribution during the lengthening phase of ventral furrow formation can be precisely described by viscous flows that quantitatively match the predictions of hydrodynamics. Cell membranes move with the ambient cytoplasm, with little resistance to, or driving force on, the flow. Strikingly, apical constriction produces similar flow patterns in mutant embryos that fail to form cells before gastrulation ('acellular' embryos), such that the global redistribution of cytoplasm mirrors the summed redistribution occurring in individual cells of wild-type embryos. Our results indicate that during the lengthening phase of ventral furrow formation, hydrodynamic behaviour of the cytoplasm provides the predominant mechanism transmitting apically generated forces deep into the tissue and that cell individualization is dispensable.

147,327,464.0,"Hyperconnectivity of neuronal circuits due to increased synaptic protein synthesis is thought to cause autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is strongly implicated in ASDs by means of upstream signalling; however, downstream regulatory mechanisms are ill-defined. Here we show that knockout of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 2 (4E-BP2)-an eIF4E repressor downstream of mTOR-or eIF4E overexpression leads to increased translation of neuroligins, which are postsynaptic proteins that are causally linked to ASDs. Mice that have the gene encoding 4E-BP2 (Eif4ebp2) knocked out exhibit an increased ratio of excitatory to inhibitory synaptic inputs and autistic-like behaviours (that is, social interaction deficits, altered communication and repetitive/stereotyped behaviours). Pharmacological inhibition of eIF4E activity or normalization of neuroligin 1, but not neuroligin 2, protein levels restores the normal excitation/inhibition ratio and rectifies the social behaviour deficits. Thus, translational control by eIF4E regulates the synthesis of neuroligins, maintaining the excitation-to-inhibition balance, and its dysregulation engenders ASD-like phenotypes.","Gkogkas, Christos G.; Khoutorsky, Arkady; Ran, Israeli; Rampakakis, Emmanouil; Nevarko, Tatiana; Weatherill, Daniel B.; Vasuta, Cristina; Yee, Stephanie; Truitt, Morgan; Dallaire, Paul; Major, Francois; Lasko, Paul; Ruggero, Davide; Nader, Karim; Lacaille, Jean-Claude; Sonenberg, Nahum","Gkogkas, CG; Khoutorsky, A; Ran, I; Rampakakis, E; Nevarko, T; Weatherill, DB; Vasuta, C; Yee, S; Truitt, M; Dallaire, P; Major, F; Lasko, P; Ruggero, D; Nader, K; Lacaille, JC; Sonenberg, N",371.0,"[Gkogkas, Christos G.; Khoutorsky, Arkady; Rampakakis, Emmanouil; Nevarko, Tatiana; Sonenberg, Nahum] McGill Univ, Dept Biochem, Montreal, PQ H3A 1A3, Canada; [Gkogkas, Christos G.; Khoutorsky, Arkady; Rampakakis, Emmanouil; Nevarko, Tatiana; Sonenberg, Nahum] McGill Univ, Goodman Canc Res Ctr, Montreal, PQ H3A 1A3, Canada; [Ran, Israeli; Weatherill, Daniel B.; Vasuta, Cristina; Lacaille, Jean-Claude] Univ Montreal, GRSNC, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Ran, Israeli; Weatherill, Daniel B.; Vasuta, Cristina; Lacaille, Jean-Claude] Univ Montreal, Dept Physiol, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Rampakakis, Emmanouil] JSS Med Res Inc, Montreal, PQ H4S 1N8, Canada; [Yee, Stephanie; Lasko, Paul] McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H3G 0B1, Canada; [Truitt, Morgan; Ruggero, Davide] Univ Calif San Francisco, Sch Med, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Truitt, Morgan; Ruggero, Davide] Univ Calif San Francisco, Helen Diller Family Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dept Urol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Dallaire, Paul; Major, Francois] Univ Montreal, Dept Comp Sci, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Dallaire, Paul; Major, Francois] Univ Montreal, Inst Res Immunol & Canc, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Nader, Karim] McGill Univ, Dept Psychol, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature11628,Article,,jean-claude.lacaille@umontreal.ca; nahum.sonenberg@mcgill.ca,U113,"Canadian Institutes of Health Research [MOP-114994, MOP-10848, MOP-93679, MOP-44050]; Autism Speaks [7109]; Fonds de la Recherche en Sante du Quebec (FRSQ; Groupe de Recherche sur le Systeme Nerveux Central); National Institutes of Health [NIH RO1 CA154916, NIH RO1 CA140456]; Canada Research Chair in Cellular and Molecular Neurophysiology; Savoy Foundation","This work was supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (N.S., MOP-114994; J.-C.L., MOP-10848; P.D. and F.M., MOP-93679; and P.L. and N.S., MOP-44050), Autism Speaks (Grant 7109 to N.S.), and the Fonds de la Recherche en Sante du Quebec (J.-C.L.

148,186,472.0,"Unicellular organisms such as yeasts require a single cyclin-dependent kinase, Cdk1, to drive cell division(1). In contrast, mammalian cells are thought to require the sequential activation of at least four different cyclin- dependent kinases, Cdk2, Cdk3, Cdk4 and Cdk6, to drive cells through interphase, as well as Cdk1 to proceed through mitosis(2). This model has been challenged by recent genetic evidence that mice survive in the absence of individual interphase Cdks(3-8). Moreover, most mouse cell types proliferate in the absence of two or even three interphase Cdks(8-10). Similar results have been obtained on ablation of some of the activating subunits of Cdks, such as the D- type and E- type cyclins(11-14). Here we show that mouse embryos lacking all interphase Cdks ( Cdk2, Cdk3, Cdk4 and Cdk6) undergo organogenesis and develop to midgestation. In these embryos, Cdk1 binds to all cyclins, resulting in the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein pRb and the expression of genes that are regulated by E2F transcription factors. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from these embryos proliferate in vitro, albeit with an extended cell cycle due to inefficient inactivation of Rb proteins. However, they become immortal on continuous passage. We also report that embryos fail to develop to the morula and blastocyst stages in the absence of Cdk1. These results indicate that Cdk1 is the only essential cell cycle Cdk. Moreover, they show that in the absence of interphase Cdks, Cdk1 can execute all the events that are required to drive cell division.","Santamaria, David; Barriere, Cedric; Cerqueira, Antonio; Hunt, Sarah; Tardy, Claudine; Newton, Kathryn; Caceres, Javier F.; Dubus, Pierre; Malumbres, Marcos; Barbacid, Mariano","Santamaria, D; Barriere, C; Cerqueira, A; Hunt, S; Tardy, C; Newton, K; Caceres, JF; Dubus, P; Malumbres, M; Barbacid, M",811.0,"Ctr Nacl Invest Oncol CNIO, Mol Oncol Programme, E-28029 Madrid, Spain; Univ Bordeaux 2, EA2406, F-33076 Bordeaux, France; Western Gen Hosp, MRC, Human Genet Unit, Edinburgh EH4 2XU, Midlothian, Scotland",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature06046,Article,,mbarbacid@cnio.es,U8,Medical Research Council [MC_U127584479],,200HJ,,,EMBRYONIC LETHALITY; DEPENDENT KINASES; GENE; MICE; DISRUPTION; P27(KIP1); MOUSE,7155.0,NATURE,Nature,English,24.0,No,"Santamaria, David/0000-0002-4711-3569; Malumbres, Marcos/0000-0002-0829-6315; Caceres, Javier/0000-0001-8025-6169; ","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",16-Aug,6.0,LONDON,17700700.0,J,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2007.0,"Santamaria, David/D-3930-2011; Malumbres, Marcos/E-8834-2011; Caceres, Javier/D-5260-2013; Tardy, Claudine/G-2737-2017","Barbacid, M (reprint author), Ctr Nacl Invest Oncol CNIO, Mol Oncol Programme, E-28029 Madrid, Spain.",Science & Technology - Other Topics,0028-0836,NATURE,396.0,Cdk1 is sufficient to drive the mammalian cell cycle,6.0,39.0,WOS:000248754200041,472.0,448,Multidisciplinary Sciences,405,mariano,barbacid,57966.0,310,male,1.0,MnhC3zUAAAAJ,5,"(17929, ]",30057956,1,30057956,1,Mariano Barbacid,Mariano Barbacid,1,1
149,431,402.0,"Understanding exotic forms of magnetism in quantum mechanical systems is a central goal of modern condensed matter physics, with implications for systems ranging from high-temperature superconductors to spintronic devices. Simulating magnetic materials in the vicinity of a quantum phase transition is computationally intractable on classical computers, owing to the extreme complexity arising from quantum entanglement between the constituent magnetic spins. Here we use a degenerate Bose gas of rubidium atoms confined in an optical lattice to simulate a chain of interacting quantum Ising spins as they undergo a phase transition. Strong spin interactions are achieved through a site-occupation to pseudo-spin mapping. As we vary a magnetic field, quantum fluctuations drive a phase transition from a paramagnetic phase into an antiferromagnetic phase. In the paramagnetic phase, the interaction between the spins is overwhelmed by the applied field, which aligns the spins. In the antiferromagnetic phase, the interaction dominates and produces staggered magnetic ordering. Magnetic domain formation is observed through both in situ site-resolved imaging and noise correlation measurements. By demonstrating a route to quantum magnetism in an optical lattice, this work should facilitate further investigations of magnetic models using ultracold atoms, thereby improving our understanding of real magnetic materials.","Simon, Jonathan; Bakr, Waseem S.; Ma, Ruichao; Tai, M.

150,98,204.0,"Deficiencies in the protein- folding capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in all eukaryotic cells lead to ER stress and trigger the unfolded protein response (UPR)(1-3). ER stress is sensed by Ire1, a transmembrane kinase/ endoribonuclease, which initiates the non- conventional splicing of the messenger RNA encoding a key transcription activator, Hac1 in yeast or XBP1 in metazoans. In the absence of ER stress, ribosomes are stalled on unspliced HAC1 mRNA. The translational control is imposed by a base- pairing interaction between the HAC1 intron and the HAC1 5' untranslated region(4). After excision of the intron, transfer RNA ligase joins the severed exons(5,6), lifting the translational block and allowing synthesis of Hac1 from the spliced HAC1 mRNA to ensue(4). Hac1 in turn drives the UPR gene expression program comprising 7-8% of the yeast genome(7) to counteract ER stress. Here we show that, on activation, Ire1 molecules cluster in the ER membrane into discrete foci of higher- order oligomers, to which unspliced HAC1 mRNA is recruited by means of a conserved bipartite targeting element contained in the 3' untranslated region. Disruption of either Ire1 clustering or HAC1 mRNA recruitment impairs UPR signalling. The HAC1 3' untranslated region element is sufficient to target other mRNAs to Ire1 foci, as long as their translation is repressed. Translational repression afforded by the intron fulfils this requirement for HAC1 mRNA. Recruitment of mRNA to signalling centres provides a new paradigm for the control of eukaryotic gene expression.","Aragon, Tomas; van Anken, Eelco; Pincus, David; Serafimova, Iana M.; Korennykh, Alexei V.; Rubio, Claudia A.; Walter, Peter","Aragon, T; van Anken, E; Pincus, D; Serafimova, IM; Korennykh, AV; Rubio, CA; Walter, P",736.0,"[Aragon, Tomas; van Anken, Eelco; Pincus, David; Serafimova, Iana M.; Korennykh, Alexei V.; Rubio, Claudia A.; Walter, Peter] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem & Biophys, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Aragon, Tomas; van Anken, Eelco; Pincus, David; Serafimova, Iana M.; Korennykh, Alexei V.; Rubio, Claudia A.; Walter, Peter] Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA",,,11/20/17,,10.1038/nature07641,Article,,Tomas.Aragon@ucsf.edu,U9,Basque Foundation for Science; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO); National Science Foundation; President's Dissertation Year Fellowship; Jane Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research,"We thank M.

The only animal model specifically reproducing the alterations in the dystrophin gene and the full spectrum of human pathology is the golden retriever dog model. Affected animals present a single mutation in intron 6, resulting in complete absence of the dystrophin protein, and early and severe muscle degeneration with nearly complete loss of motility and walking ability. Death usually occurs at about 1 year of age as a result of failure of respiratory muscles. Here we report that intra-arterial delivery of wild-type canine mesoangioblasts (vessel-associated stem cells) results in an extensive recovery of dystrophin expression, normal muscle morphology and function ( confirmed by measurement of contraction force on single fibres). The outcome is a remarkable clinical amelioration and preservation of active motility.

The capacity and range of signalling is thought to be regulated by its interaction with the receptor PTCH1 and antagonist HIP1. Here we show that a BDA1 mutation (E95K) in Ihh impairs the interaction of IHH with PTCH1 and HIP1. This is consistent with a recent paper showing that BDA1 mutations cluster in a calcium-binding site essential for the interaction with its receptor and cell-surface partners(5). Furthermore, we show that in a mouse model that recapitulates the E95K mutation, there is a change in the potency and range of signalling. The mice have digit abnormalities consistent with the human disorder.","Gao, Bo; Hu, Jianxin; Stricker, Sigmar; Cheung, Martin; Ma, Gang; Law, Kit Fong; Witte, Florian; Briscoe, James; Mundlos, Stefan; He, Lin; Cheah, Kathryn S.
