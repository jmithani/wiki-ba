Its inclined and circular orbit lies between a group of small inner prograde satellites and a number of exterior irregular satellites with both prograde and retrograde orbits. This unusual configuration has led to the belief that Triton originally orbited the Sun before being captured in orbit around Neptune(1-3). Existing models(4-6) for its capture, however, all have significant bottlenecks that make their effectiveness doubtful. Here we report that a three-body gravitational encounter between a binary system (of similar to 10(3)-kilometre-sized bodies) and Neptune is a far more likely explanation for Triton's capture. Our model predicts that Triton was once a member of a binary with a range of plausible characteristics, including ones similar to the Pluto - Charon pair.","Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Earth Sci, Ctr Origin Dynam & Evolut Planets, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; Univ Maryland, Dept Astron, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Agnor, CB (reprint author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Earth Sci, Ctr Origin Dynam & Evolut Planets, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",cagnor@pmc.ucsc.edu,,,,,,30,104,107,0,16,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-May,2006,441,7090,,,,,192,194,,10.1038/nature04792,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,040YP,WOS:000237418800039,16688170.0,No,,,11/20/17,dp,hamilton,male,1,4,wd3POpUAAAAJ,2835

In these materials, strong electronic correlations often lead to competing ground states that are sensitive to many parameters - in particular the doping level so that complex phase diagrams are observed. A flexible way to explore the role of doping is to tune the electron or hole concentration with electric fields, as is done in standard semiconductor field effect transistors(3). Here we demonstrate a model oxide system based on high-quality heterostructures in which the ferroelectric field effect approach can be studied. We use a single-crystal film of the perovskite superconductor Nb-doped SrTiO3 as the superconducting channel and ferroelectric Pb(Zr, Ti) O-3 as the gate oxide. Atomic force microscopy is used to locally reverse the ferroelectric polarization, thus inducing large resistivity and carrier modulations, resulting in a clear shift in the superconducting critical temperature. Field-induced switching from the normal state to the ( zero resistance) superconducting state was achieved at a well-defined temperature. This unique system could lead to a field of research in which devices are realized by locally defining in the same material superconducting and normal regions with `perfect' interfaces, the interface being purely electronic. Using this approach, one could potentially design one-dimensional superconducting wires, superconducting rings and junctions, superconducting quantum interference devices ( SQUIDs) or arrays of pinning centres.","Univ Geneva, DPMC, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland; Univ Paris 11, Phys Solides Lab, F-91405 Orsay, France; Univ Tokyo, Inst Solid State Phys, Chiba 2778581, Japan","Triscone, JM (reprint author), Univ Geneva, DPMC, 24 Quai Ernest Ansermet, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland.",Jean-Marc.Triscone@physics.unige.ch,"Kim, Yu Jin/A-2433-2012; Shibuya, Keisuke/K-2079-2012; Takahashi, Kei/B-2498-2013; OHNISHI, Tsuyoshi/H-2670-2011","OHNISHI, Tsuyoshi/0000-0002-2333-7752",,,,24,57,58,6,110,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-May,2006,441,7090,,,,,195,198,,10.1038/nature04731,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,040YP,WOS:000237418800040,16688171.0,No,,,11/20/17,jm,triscone,male,0.83,126,na,na

The slow progress within silicon optoelectronics, where electronic and optical functionalities can be integrated into monolithic components based on the versatile silicon platform, is due to the limited active optical properties of silicon(3). Recently, however, a continuous-wave Raman silicon laser was demonstrated(4); if an effective modulator could also be realized in silicon, data processing and transmission could potentially be performed by all-silicon electronic and optical components. Here we have discovered that a significant linear electro-optic effect is induced in silicon by breaking the crystal symmetry. The symmetry is broken by depositing a straining layer on top of a silicon waveguide, and the induced nonlinear coefficient, chi(2) approximate to 15 pm V-1, makes it possible to realize a silicon electro-optic modulator. The strain-induced linear electro-optic effect may be used to remove a bottleneck(5) in modern computers by replacing the electronic bus with a much faster optical alternative.","Tech Univ Denmark, Nano DTU, Dept Commun Opt & Mat, COM DTU, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; Tech Univ Denmark, Nano DTU, MIC Dept Micro & Nanotechnol, CINF, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark","Jacobsen, RS (reprint author), Tech Univ Denmark, Nano DTU, Dept Commun Opt & Mat, COM DTU, Bldg 345V, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.",Rune@com.dtu.dk,"Hansen, Ole/C-4480-2011; Frandsen, Lars Hagedorn/B-4535-2012; Peucheret, Christophe/C-1359-2011; Lavrinenko, Andrei/E-4099-2015; Ou, Haiyan/D-8728-2011","Hansen, Ole/0000-0002-6090-8323; Frandsen, Lars Hagedorn/0000-0001-9145-2210; Peucheret, Christophe/0000-0002-1655-9293; Ou, Haiyan/0000-0002-0538-8230",,,,26,378,380,9,127,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-May,2006,441,7090,,,,,199,202,,10.1038/nature04706,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,040YP,WOS:000237418800041,16688172.0,No,,,11/20/17,a,bjarklev,male,0.59,56,na,na

Large objects are widely believed to be completely melted or vaporized during high-angle impact with the Earth(2,3). Consequently, identification of large impactors relies on indirect chemical tracers, notably the platinum-group elements(4). Here we report the discovery of a large (25-cm), unaltered, fossil meteorite, and several smaller fragments within the impact melt of the giant (> 70 km diameter), 145-Myr-old Morokweng crater, South Africa. The large fragment ( clast) resembles an LL6 chondrite breccia, but contains anomalously iron-rich silicates, Fe-Ni sulphides, and no troilite or metal. It has chondritic chromium isotope ratios and identical platinum-group element ratios to the bulk impact melt. These features allow the unambiguous characterization of an impactor at a large crater. Furthermore, the unusual composition of the meteorite suggests that the Morokweng asteroid incorporated part of the LL chondrite parent body not represented by objects at present reaching the Earth.","Univ Quebec, Chicoutimi, PQ G7H 2B1, Canada; Univ Pretoria, Dept Geol, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; S African Nucl Energy Corp, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa; Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Geosci, ZA-2050 Wits, South Africa; Cardiff Univ, Sch Earth Ocean & Planetary Sci, Cardiff CF10 3YE, Wales; Scottish Univ Environm Res Ctr, E Kilbride G75 0QF, Lanark, Scotland; Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Indiana Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; Ithemba LABS Gauteng, ZA-2050 Wits, South Africa","Maier, WD (reprint author), Univ Quebec, Chicoutimi, PQ G7H 2B1, Canada.",wolfgang_maier@uqac.ca,"Boyce, Adrian/D-2263-2010","Boyce, Adrian/0000-0002-9680-0787; McDonald, Iain/0000-0001-9066-7244",,,,33,39,39,0,12,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-May,2006,441,7090,,,,,203,206,,10.1038/nature04751,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,040YP,WOS:000237418800042,16688173.0,No,,,11/20/17,rj,hart,male,0.83,108,na,na

Here I add many new radiocarbon dates to those already published on late Pleistocene fossils from Alaska and the Yukon Territory (AK - YT) and show previously unrecognized patterns. Species that survived the Pleistocene, for example, bison ( Bison priscus, which evolved into Bison bison), wapiti (Cervus canadensis) and, to a smaller degree, moose (Alces alces), began to increase in numbers and continued to do so before and during human colonization and before the regional extinction of horse ( Equus ferus) and mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius). These patterns allow us to reject, at least in AK - YT, some hypotheses of late Pleistocene extinction: 'Blitzkrieg' version of simultaneous human overkill(2), 'keystone' removal(3), and 'palaeo-disease'(4). Hypotheses of a subtler human impact and/or ecological replacement or displacement are more consistent with the data.

Allopatric speciation, the divergence of species resulting from geographical isolation, is well documented(1). However, sympatric speciation, divergence without geographical isolation, is highly controversial(2). Claims of sympatric speciation must demonstrate species sympatry, sister relationships, reproductive isolation, and that an earlier allopatric phase is highly unlikely(1). Here we provide clear support for sympatric speciation in a case study of two species of palm ( Arecaceae) on an oceanic island. A large dated phylogenetic tree shows that the two species of Howea, endemic to the remote Lord Howe Island, are sister taxa and diverged from each other well after the island was formed 6.9 million years ago(3). During fieldwork, we found a substantial disjunction in flowering time that is correlated with soil preference. In addition, a genome scan(4,5) indicates that few genetic loci are more divergent between the two species than expected under neutrality, a finding consistent with models of sympatric speciation involving disruptive/ divergent selection(2). This case study of sympatric speciation in plants provides an opportunity for refining theoretical models on the origin of species, and new impetus for exploring putative plant and animal examples on oceanic islands.","Royal Bot Gardens, Richmond TW9 3DS, Surrey, England; Ctr Evolutionary & Funct Ecol, UMR 5175, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France; Aarhus Univ, Dept Systemat Bot, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","Savolainen, V (reprint author), Royal Bot Gardens, Richmond TW9 3DS, Surrey, England.",v.savolainen@kew.org,"Baker, William/B-1244-2011; Lexer, Christian/N-3702-2013; Anstett, Marie Charlotte/N-7977-2017","Baker, William/0000-0001-6727-1831; Anstett, Marie Charlotte/0000-0001-7786-0357; Savolainen, Vincent/0000-0001-5350-9984",,,,30,341,356,16,261,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-May,2006,441,7090,,,,,210,213,,10.1038/nature04566,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,040YP,WOS:000237418800044,16467788.0,No,,,11/20/17,wj,baker,male,1,2,_XYSdkkAAAAJ,411

Kin selection(1) provides a widely accepted theoretical framework for understanding these societies, but differences in genetic relatedness do not explain a universal societal feature: the huge variation between individuals in helping effort(2-10). An alternative explanation for this variation lies in a fundamental trade-off faced by helpers: by working harder, they increase the indirect component of their fitness, but simultaneously decrease their own future survival and fecundity(2,4,8). Here, we show that individuals work less hard when they stand to lose more future fitness through working. We experimentally manipulated two components of future fitness in social queues of hover wasps (Stenogastrinae): a helper's chance of inheriting an egg-laying position, and the workforce available to rear her offspring should she inherit. After each manipulation, helpers increased or decreased their effort as appropriate to the change in expected future fitness that they experienced. Although helping provides significant indirect fitness benefits for hover wasps(11), our study shows that variation in the costs associated with helping is the major determinant of helping effort.","UCL, Dept Biol, London NW1 2HE, England","Field, J (reprint author), UCL, Dept Biol, Wolfson House,4 Stephenson Way, London NW1 2HE, England.",jeremy.field@ucl.ac.uk,,,,,,28,71,76,0,33,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-May,2006,441,7090,,,,,214,217,,10.1038/nature04560,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,040YP,WOS:000237418800045,16688175.0,No,,,11/20/17,c,bridge,male,0.74,27,na,na

Neural crest cells originate along the border between the neural plate and epidermis(1), migrate extensively and generate numerous derivatives, including neurons and glia of the peripheral nervous system, melanocytes, bone and cartilage of the head skeleton(2). Impaired neural crest development is associated with human defects, including cleft palate(3). Classically, the neural crest has been thought to form by interactions at the border between neural and non-neural ectoderm or mesoderm(4-7), and defined factors such as bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and Wnt proteins have been postulated as neural crest-inducers(8-13). Although competence to induce crest cells declines after stage 10 ( ref. 14), little is known about when neural crest induction begins in vivo. Here we report that neural crest induction is underway during gastrulation and well before proper neural plate appearance. We show that a restricted region of chick epiblast ( stage 3 - 4) is specified to generate neural crest cells when explanted under non-inducing conditions. This region expresses the transcription factor Pax7 by stage 41 and later contributes to neural folds and migrating neural crest. In chicken embryos, Pax7 is required for neural crest formation in vivo, because blocking its translation inhibits expression of the neural crest markers Slug, Sox9, Sox10 and HNK-1. Our results indicate that neural crest specification initiates earlier than previously assumed, independently of mesodermal and neural tissues, and that Pax7 has a crucial function during neural crest development.","CALTECH, Div Biol 139 74, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; Yale Univ, MCDB, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Garcia-Castro, MI (reprint author), CALTECH, Div Biol 139 74, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",martin.garcia-castro@yale.edu,"Basch, Martin/I-6632-2012","Bronner, Marianne/0000-0003-4274-1862",,,,30,172,175,4,20,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-May,2006,441,7090,,,,,218,222,,10.1038/nature04684,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,040YP,WOS:000237418800046,16688176.0,No,,,11/20/17,mi,garcia-castro,female,0.56,113,na,na

There is no intrinsically 'correct' answer: economic choice depends on subjective preferences. This behaviour is traditionally the object of economic analysis(1) and is also of primary interest in psychology(2). However, the underlying mental processes and neuronal mechanisms are not well understood. Theories of human and animal choice(1-3) have a cornerstone in the concept of 'value'. Consider, for example, a monkey offered one raisin versus one piece of apple: behavioural evidence suggests that the animal chooses by assigning values to the two options(4). But where and how values are represented in the brain is unclear. Here we show that, during economic choice, neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex(5-18) (OFC) encode the value of offered and chosen goods. Notably, OFC neurons encode value independently of visuospatial factors and motor responses. If a monkey chooses between A and B, neurons in the OFC encode the value of the two goods independently of whether A is presented on the right and B on the left, or vice versa. This trait distinguishes the OFC from other brain areas in which value modulates activity related to sensory or motor processes(19-25). Our results have broad implications for possible psychological models, suggesting that economic choice is essentially choice between goods rather than choice between actions. In this framework, neurons in the OFC seem to be a good candidate network for value assignment underlying economic choice.","Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Padoa-Schioppa, C (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, 220 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",camillo@alum.mit.edu,,"Padoa-Schioppa, Camillo/0000-0002-7519-8790","NINDS NIH HHS [R01 NS041000-01, R01 NS041000]",,,30,671,682,3,49,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-May,2006,441,7090,,,,,223,226,,10.1038/nature04676,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,040YP,WOS:000237418800047,16633341.0,No,,,11/20/17,ja,assad,male,0.7,77,na,na

Variations in branching patterns lead to diversity in flower-bearing architectures ( inflorescences) and affect crop yield by influencing seed number or harvesting ability(2,3). Several growth regulators such as auxins, cytokinins and carotenoid derivatives regulate branching architectures(4). Inflorescence branching in maize is regulated by three RAMOSA genes(5). Here we show that one of these genes, RAMOSA3 (RA3), encodes a trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase expressed in discrete domains subtending axillary inflorescence meristems. Genetic and molecular data indicate that RA3 functions through the predicted transcriptional regulator RAMOSA1 (RA1)(5). We propose that RA3 regulates inflorescence branching by modification of a sugar signal that moves into axillary meristems. Alternatively, the fact that RA3 acts upstream of RA1 supports a hypothesis that RA3 itself may have a transcriptional regulatory function.","Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; DuPont Crop Genet Expt Stn E353, Wilmington, DE 19880 USA; Univ Missouri, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63121 USA","Jackson, D (reprint author), Cold Spring Harbor Lab, 1 Bungtown Rd, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA.",jacksond@cshl.edu,,,,,,27,170,184,4,43,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-May,2006,441,7090,,,,,227,230,,10.1038/nature04725,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,040YP,WOS:000237418800048,16688177.0,No,,,11/20/17,d,jackson,male,0.79,43,na,na

Like T(H)1 and T(H)2, T(H)17 cells almost certainly evolved to provide adaptive immunity tailored to specific classes of pathogens(3), such as extracellular bacteria(4). Aberrant T(H)17 responses have been implicated in a growing list of autoimmune disorders(5-7). T(H)17 development has been linked to IL-23, an IL-12 cytokine family member that shares with IL-12 a common subunit, IL-12p40 (ref. 8). The IL-23 and IL-12 receptors also share a subunit, IL-12R beta 1, that pairs with unique, inducible components, IL-23R and IL-12R beta 2, to confer receptor responsiveness(9). Here we identify transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) as a cytokine critical for commitment to T(H)17 development. TGF-beta acts to upregulate IL-23R expression, thereby conferring responsiveness to IL-23. Although dispensable for the development of IL-17-producing T cells in vitro and in vivo, IL-23 is required for host protection against a bacterial pathogen, Citrobacter rodentium. The action of TGF-beta on naive T cells is antagonized by interferon-gamma and IL-4, thus providing a mechanism for divergence of the T(H)1, T(H)2 and T(H)17 lineages.","Univ Alabama, Dept Pathol, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; Univ Alabama, Dept Microbiol, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; Univ Alabama, Dept Genom, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; Univ Alabama, Dept Med, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; Natl Inst Dent & Craniofacial Dis, Cellular Immunol Sect, Oral Infect & Immun Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Weaver, CT (reprint author), Univ Alabama, Dept Pathol, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA.",cweaver@uab.edu,"O'Quinn, Darrell/B-3318-2008","Weaver, Casey/0000-0002-2180-1793",,,,26,1960,2099,3,78,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-May,2006,441,7090,,,,,231,234,,10.1038/nature04754,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,040YP,WOS:000237418800049,16648837.0,No,,,11/20/17,ct,weaver,female,0.5,20,na,na

T-helper (T-H) cells are traditionally thought to differentiate into T(H)1 and T(H)2 cell subsets. T(H)1 cells are necessary to clear intracellular pathogens and T(H)2 cells are important for clearing extracellular organisms(1,2). Recently, a subset of interleukin ( IL)-17-producing T (T(H)17) cells distinct from T(H)1 or T(H)2 cells has been described and shown to have a crucial role in the induction of autoimmune tissue injury(3-5). In contrast, CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp3(+) regulatory T (T-reg) cells inhibit autoimmunity and protect against tissue injury(6). Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is a critical differentiation factor for the generation of T-reg cells(7). Here we show, using mice with a reporter introduced into the endogenous Foxp3 locus, that IL-6, an acute phase protein induced during inflammation(8,9), completely inhibits the generation of Foxp3(+) T-reg cells induced by TGF-beta. We also demonstrate that IL-23 is not the differentiation factor for the generation of T(H)17 cells. Instead, IL-6 and TGF-beta together induce the differentiation of pathogenic T(H)17 cells from naive T cells.

Such immune evasion tactics have not previously been intentionally applied to the development of novel viral gene delivery vectors that overcome the critical problem of anti-vector immunity. Recombinant, replication-incompetent adenovirus serotype 5 (rAd5) vector-based vaccines for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and other pathogens have proved highly immunogenic in preclinical studies(1,2) but will probably be limited by the high prevalence of pre-existing anti-Ad5 immunity in human populations, particularly in the developing world(3-6). Here we show that rAd5 vectors can be engineered to circumvent anti-Ad5 immunity. We constructed novel chimaeric rAd5 vectors in which the seven short hypervariable regions (HVRs) on the surface of the Ad5 hexon protein were replaced with the corresponding HVRs from the rare adenovirus serotype Ad48. These HVR-chimaeric rAd5 vectors were produced at high titres and were stable through serial passages in vitro. HVR-chimaeric rAd5 vectors expressing simian immunodeficiency virus Gag proved comparably immunogenic to parental rAd5 vectors in naive mice and rhesus monkeys. In the presence of high levels of pre-existing anti-Ad5 immunity, the immunogenicity of HVR-chimaeric rAd5 vectors was not detectably suppressed, whereas the immunogenicity of parental rAd5 vectors was abrogated. These data demonstrate that functionally relevant Ad5-specific neutralizing antibodies are focused on epitopes located within the hexon HVRs. Moreover, these studies show that recombinant viral vectors can be engineered to circumvent pre-existing anti-vector immunity by removing key neutralizing epitopes on the surface of viral capsid proteins. Such chimaeric viral vectors may have important practical implications for vaccination and gene therapy.","Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Div Viral Pathogenesis, Boston, MA 02215 USA; Crucell Holland BV, NL-2301 CA Leiden, Netherlands; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Childrens Hosp, Mol Med Lab, Boston, MA 02115 USA; S African MRC, ZA-4001 Durban, South Africa; New England Reg Primate Res Ctr, Southborough, MA 01772 USA","Barouch, DH (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Div Viral Pathogenesis, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",dbarouch@bidmc.harvard.edu,,,,,,22,284,292,0,11,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-May,2006,441,7090,,,,,239,243,,10.1038/nature04721,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,040YP,WOS:000237418800051,16625206.0,No,,,11/20/17,dh,barouch,male,0.67,3,na,na

However, in programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting(2), a specific subversion of frame maintenance takes place, wherein the ribosome is forced to shift one nucleotide backwards into an overlapping reading frame and to translate an entirely new sequence of amino acids. This process is indispensable in the replication of numerous viral pathogens, including HIV and the coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome(3), and is also exploited in the expression of several cellular genes(4). Frameshifting is promoted by an mRNA signal composed of two essential elements: a heptanucleotide 'slippery' sequence(5) and an adjacent mRNA secondary structure, most often an mRNA pseudoknot(6). How these components operate together to manipulate the ribosome is unknown. Here we describe the observation of a ribosome - mRNA pseudoknot complex that is stalled in the process of -1 frameshifting. Cryoelectron microscopic imaging of purified mammalian 80S ribosomes from rabbit reticulocytes paused at a coronavirus pseudoknot reveals an intermediate of the frameshifting process. From this it can be seen how the pseudoknot interacts with the ribosome to block the mRNA entrance channel, compromising the translocation process and leading to a spring-like deformation of the P-site transfer RNA. In addition, we identify movements of the likely eukaryotic ribosomal helicase and confirm a direct interaction between the translocase eEF2 and the P-site tRNA. Together, the structural changes provide a mechanical explanation of how the pseudoknot manipulates the ribosome into a different reading frame.","Univ Cambridge, Dept Pathol, Div Virol, Cambridge CB2 1QP, England; Univ Oxford, Div Struct Biol, Oxford OX3 7BN, England; Univ Oxford, Cent Chem Lab, Oxford Ctr Mol Sci, Oxford OX1 3QH, England","Brierley, I (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Pathol, Div Virol, Tennis Court Rd, Cambridge CB2 1QP, England.",gilbert@strubi.ox.ac.uk; ib103@mole.bio.cam.ac.uk,"Namy, olivier/B-8906-2008","Namy, Olivier/0000-0002-1143-5961","Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/D013305/1, BB/D009499/1]; Medical Research Council [G0500365]; Wellcome Trust",,,29,155,158,1,15,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-May,2006,441,7090,,,,,244,247,,10.1038/nature04735,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,040YP,WOS:000237418800052,16688178.0,No,,,11/20/17,i,brierley,na,na,na,na,na

However, the mechanism of shugoshin-dependent protection of cohesin is unknown. Here we find a specific subtype of serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) associating with human shugoshin. PP2A colocalizes with shugoshin at centromeres and is required for centromeric protection. Purified shugoshin complex has an ability to reverse the phosphorylation of cohesin in vitro, suggesting that dephosphorylation of cohesin is the mechanism of protection at centromeres. Meiotic shugoshin of fission yeast also associates with PP2A, with both proteins collaboratively protecting Rec8-containing cohesin at centromeres.

Destruction of sister chromatid cohesion along chromosome arms due to proteolytic cleavage of cohesin's Rec8 subunit by separase resolves chiasmata and thereby triggers the first meiotic division. This produces univalent chromosomes, the chromatids of which are held together by centromeric cohesin that has been protected from separase by shugoshin (Sgo1/MEI-S332) proteins. Here we show in both fission and budding yeast that Sgo1 recruits to centromeres a specific form of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Its inactivation causes loss of centromeric cohesin at anaphase I and random segregation of sister centromeres at the second meiotic division. Artificial recruitment of PP2A to chromosome arms prevents Rec8 phosphorylation and hinders resolution of chiasmata.

Saturn's rotation, however, is difficult to determine because there is no solid surface from which to time it, and the alternative 'clock'-the magnetic field-is nearly symmetrically aligned with the rotation axis(1-7). Radio emissions, thought to provide a proxy measure of the rotation of the magnetic field, have yielded estimates of the rotation period between 10 h 39 min 22 s and 10 h 45 min 45 s (refs 8-10). Because the period determined from radio measurements exhibits large time variations, even on time-scales of months, it has been uncertain whether the radio-emission periodicity coincides with the inner rotation rate of the planet. Here we report magnetic field measurements that revealed a time-stationary magnetic signal with a period of 10 h 47 min 6 s +/-40 s.

In contrast, the low-temperature behaviour of 'metallic' polymers has, in all previous cases, exhibited an increase in resistivity as temperature is further decreased, as a result of disorder-induced localization of the charge carriers(1-4).

Discrete tunnel junctions, or molecular diodes, have been reported using scanning probes(11,12), break junctions(13,14), metallic crossbars(6) and nanopores(8,15). For technological applications, molecular tunnel junctions must be reliable, stable and reproducible. The conductance per molecule, however, typically varies by many orders of magnitude(5). Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) may offer a promising route to the fabrication of reliable devices, and charge transport through SAMs of alkanethiols within nanopores is well understood, with non-resonant tunnelling dominating the transport mechanism(8). Unfortunately, electrical shorts in SAMs are often formed upon vapour deposition of the top electrode(16-18), which limits the diameter of the nanopore diodes to about 45 nm. Here we demonstrate a method to manufacture molecular junctions with diameters up to 100 mu m with high yields (>95 per cent). The junctions show excellent stability and reproducibility, and the conductance per unit area is similar to that obtained for benchmark nanopore diodes. Our technique involves processing the molecular junctions in the holes of a lithographically patterned photoresist, and then inserting a conducting polymer interlayer between the SAM and the metal top electrode. This simple approach is potentially low-cost and could pave the way for practical molecular electronics.","Univ Groningen, Mat Sci Ctr Plus, NL-9747 AG Groningen, Netherlands; Philips Res Labs, NL-5656 AA Eindhoven, Netherlands","Akkerman, HB (reprint author), Univ Groningen, Mat Sci Ctr Plus, Nijenborgh 4, NL-9747 AG Groningen, Netherlands.",b.de.boer@rug.nl,"Akkerman, Hylke/C-3008-2008",,,,,23,413,419,13,163,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,4-May,2006,441,7089,,,,,69,72,,10.1038/nature04699,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,038TB,WOS:000237248600033,16672966.0,No,,,11/20/17,b,de boer,male,0.65,40,na,na

Simple theories suggest that global warming will reduce the strength of the mean tropical atmospheric circulation(4,5). An important aspect of this tropical circulation is a large-scale zonal (east-west) overturning of air across the equatorial Pacific Ocean-driven by convection to the west and subsidence to the east-known as the Walker circulation(6). Here we explore changes in tropical Pacific circulation since the mid-nineteenth century using observations and a suite of global climate model experiments. Observed Indo-Pacific sea level pressure reveals a weakening of the Walker circulation. The size of this trend is consistent with theoretical predictions, is accurately reproduced by climate model simulations and, within the climate models, is largely due to anthropogenic forcing. The climate model indicates that the weakened surface winds have altered the thermal structure and circulation of the tropical Pacific Ocean. These results support model projections of further weakening of tropical atmospheric circulation during the twenty-first century(4,5,7).","NOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USA","Vecchi, GA (reprint author), NOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.",Gabriel.A.Vecchi@noaa.gov,"Vecchi, Gabriel/A-2413-2008; Wittenberg, Andrew/G-9619-2013","Vecchi, Gabriel/0000-0002-5085-224X; Wittenberg, Andrew/0000-0003-1680-8963",,,,30,495,514,5,125,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,4-May,2006,441,7089,,,,,73,76,,10.1038/nature04744,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,038TB,WOS:000237248600034,16672967.0,No,,,11/20/17,mj,harrison,female,0.64,110,na,na

Despite features found in basal actinopterygians (for example, Dialipina and Ligulalepis)(1-3) and basal sarcopterygians (for example, Psarolepis and Achoania)(4,5), the morphological gap between the two lineages remains wide and how sarcopterygians developed a dermal surface covering known as cosmine (composed of a pore-canal network and a single layer of odontodes and enamel) is still poorly known(6-10). Here we describe a primitive fossil fish, Meemannia eos gen. et sp. nov., that possesses an actinopterygian-like skull roof and a cosmine-like dermal surface combining a pore-canal network (found in various fossil sarcopterygians) with superimposed layers of odontodes and enamel (previously known in actinopterygians and some acanthodians(11-13)). This 405-million-year-old fish from the Lower Devonian of Yunnan (China) demonstrates that cosmine in many fossil sarcopterygians arose step by step through the acquisition of a pore-canal network followed by the subsequently developed ability to resorb previous generations of odontodes and enamel. Meemannia provides key characters for studying deep osteichthyan phylogeny and indicates a possible morphotype for the common ancestor of actinopterygians and sarcopterygians.","Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Paleontol & Paleoanthropol, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; Kean Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Union, NJ 07083 USA","Zhu, M (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Paleontol & Paleoanthropol, POB 643, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China.",zhumin@ivpp.ac.cn,"Yu, Xiaobo/G-7160-2011; Zhu, Min/E-8728-2012","Zhu, Min/0000-0002-4786-0898; Yu, Xiaobo/0000-0001-9600-7888",,,,30,52,54,0,14,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-May,2006,441,7089,,,,,77,80,,10.1038/nature04563,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,038TB,WOS:000237248600035,16672968.0,No,,,11/20/17,lt,jia,na,na,na,na,na

Here we investigate the population consequences of such mistiming in the migratory pied flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca(4). In a comparison of nine Dutch populations, we find that populations have declined by about 90% over the past two decades in areas where the food for provisioning nestlings peaks early in the season and the birds are currently mistimed. In areas with a late food peak, early-breeding birds still breed at the right time, and there is, at most, a weak population decline. If food phenology advances further, we also predict population declines in areas with a late food peak, as in these areas adjustment to an advanced food peak is insufficient(4). Mistiming as a result of climate change is probably a widespread phenomenon(1), and here we provide evidence that it can lead to population declines.","NIOO KNAW, Netherlands Inst Ecol, NL-6666 ZG Heteren, Netherlands; Univ Groningen, Anim Ecol Grp, Ctr Ecol & Evolut Studies, NL-9750 AA Haren, Netherlands","Both, C (reprint author), NIOO KNAW, Netherlands Inst Ecol, POB 40, NL-6666 ZG Heteren, Netherlands.",C.Both@rug.nl,"Visser, Marcel/A-9151-2009; Lessells, C.M./B-3891-2011; Both, Christiaan/E-6459-2011; Bouwhuis, Sandra/H-5270-2011","Visser, Marcel/0000-0002-1456-1939; Lessells, C.M./0000-0002-7004-1954; Bouwhuis, Sandra/0000-0003-4023-1578; van der Heijden, Marianne/0000-0002-0795-3619",,,,28,628,667,35,539,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-May,2006,441,7089,,,,,81,83,,10.1038/nature04539,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,038TB,WOS:000237248600036,16672969.0,No,,,11/20/17,me,visser,na,na,na,na,na

To date, empirical studies have provided support for parts of this scenario(1), but evidence for all key genetic components in a natural population is lacking. Here we use animal-model quantitative genetic analysis(2,3) on data from over 8,500 collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis) followed for 24 years to quantify all of the key genetic requirements of both fisherian(4,5) and 'good-genes' models(6,7) on sexual selection in the wild. We found significant additive genetic variances of all the main components: male ornament (forehead patch size), female mate choice for this ornament, male fitness and female fitness. However, when the necessary genetic correlations between these components were taken into account, the estimated strength of indirect sexual selection on female mate choice was negligible. Our results show that the combined effect of environmental influences on several components reduces the potential for indirect sexual selection in the wild. This study provides insight into the field of sexual selection by showing that genes coding for mate choice for an ornament probably evolve by their own pathways instead of 'hitchhiking' with genes coding for the ornament.","Uppsala Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolut, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden; Univ Helsinki, Bird Ecol Unit, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Qvarnstrom, A (reprint author), Uppsala Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Norbyvagen 18D, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden.",,"Brommer, Jon/C-3613-2008; Gustafsson, Lars/A-7634-2012","Brommer, Jon/0000-0002-2435-2612; Gustafsson, Lars/0000-0001-6566-2863; Qvarnstrom, Anna/0000-0002-1178-4053",,,,30,147,148,0,74,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-May,2006,441,7089,,,,,84,86,,10.1038/nature04564,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,038TB,WOS:000237248600037,16672970.0,No,,,11/20/17,l,gustafsson,female,0.58,24,na,na

Many thousands more are predicted on the basis of comparative genomics(2,3). However, in stark contrast to the genes that they regulate, in invertebrates virtually none of these regions can be traced by using sequence similarity, leaving their evolutionary origins obscure. Here we show that a class of conserved, primarily non-coding regions in tetrapods originated from a previously unknown short interspersed repetitive element (SINE) retroposon family that was active in the Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fishes and terrestrial vertebrates) in the Silurian period at least 410 million years ago (ref. 4), and seems to be recently active in the 'living fossil' Indonesian coelacanth, Latimeria menadoensis. Using a mouse enhancer assay we show that one copy, 0.5 million bases from the neuro-developmental gene ISL1, is an enhancer that recapitulates multiple aspects of Isl1 expression patterns. Several other copies represent new, possibly regulatory, alternatively spliced exons in the middle of pre-existing Sarcopterygian genes. One of these, a more than 200-base-pair ultraconserved region(5), 100% identical in mammals, and 80% identical to the coelacanth SINE, contains a 31-amino-acid-residue alternatively spliced exon of the messenger RNA processing gene PCBP2 (ref. 6). These add to a growing list of examples(7) in which relics of transposable elements have acquired a function that serves their host, a process termed 'exaptation'(8), and provide an origin for at least some of the many highly conserved vertebrate-specific genomic sequences.","Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ctr Biomol Sci & Engn, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; DOE Joint Genome Inst, Walnut Creek, CA 94598 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Genom Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA","Bejerano, G (reprint author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ctr Biomol Sci & Engn, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",jill@soe.ucsc.edu,,"Ahituv, Nadav/0000-0002-7434-8144; Siepel, Adam/0000-0002-3557-7219",,,,30,306,312,2,34,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,4-May,2006,441,7089,,,,,87,90,,10.1038/nature04696,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,038TB,WOS:000237248600038,16625209.0,No,,,11/20/17,d,haussler,male,0.79,43,na,na

However, a major bottleneck in generating useful small-molecule tools is target identification. Here we show that Caenorhabditis elegans can provide a platform for both the discovery of new bioactive compounds and target identification. We screened 14,100 small molecules for bioactivity in wild-type worms and identified 308 compounds that induce a variety of phenotypes. One compound that we named nemadipine-A induces marked defects in morphology and egg-laying. Nemadipine-A resembles a class of widely prescribed anti-hypertension drugs called the 1,4-dihydropyridines (DHPs) that antagonize the alpha(1)-subunit of L-type calcium channels(2,3). Through a genetic suppressor screen, we identified egl-19 as the sole candidate target of nemadipine-A, a conclusion that is supported by several additional lines of evidence. egl-19 encodes the only L-type calcium channel alpha(1)-subunit in the C. elegans genome(4,5). We show that nemadipine-A can also antagonize vertebrate L-type calcium channels, demonstrating that worms and vertebrates share the orthologous protein target. Conversely, FDA-approved DHPs fail to elicit robust phenotypes, making nemadipine-A a unique tool to screen for genetic interactions with this important class of drugs. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of nemadipine- A by using it to reveal redundancy among three calcium channels in the egg-laying circuit.

BRs bind to the plasma membrane receptor kinase BRI1, and act through a signalling pathway that involves a glycogen synthase kinase-3-like kinase (BIN2) and a serine/threonine phosphatase (BSU1)(3-5). Previous models proposed that BIN2 negatively regulates BR signalling by controlling the stability and subcellular localization of the related transcription factors BES1 and BZR1 by phosphorylation, in a manner reminiscent of the canonical Wnt signalling pathway of metazoans(6-9). Here we present strong evidence for a different mode of regulation of BR signalling. We show that BES1 is localized constitutively to the nucleus, where its activity is modulated by nuclear-localized BIN2 kinase. BIN2-mediated phosphorylation of BES1 inhibits its DNA-binding activity on BR-responsive target promoters and its transcriptional activity through impaired multimerization. Our observations demonstrate that phosphorylation-dependent inhibition of DNA binding and trans-activation is the key primary mechanism of BES1 regulation.","Salk Inst Biol Studies, Plant Biol Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; Salk Inst Biol Studies, Howard Hughes Med Inst, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Chory, J (reprint author), Salk Inst Biol Studies, Plant Biol Lab, 10010 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",chory@salk.edu,,"Vert, Greg/0000-0002-0844-9991",,,,27,180,193,4,34,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-May,2006,441,7089,,,,,96,100,,10.1038/nature04681,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,038TB,WOS:000237248600040,16672972.0,No,,,11/20/17,j,chory,male,0.83,122,na,na

In vitro studies suggest that both RIG-I and MDA5 detect RNA viruses and polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), a synthetic dsRNA analogue(3). Although a critical role for RIG-I in the recognition of several RNA viruses has been clarified(8), the functional role of MDA5 and the relationship between these dsRNA detectors in vivo are yet to be determined. Here we use mice deficient in MDA5 (MDA5(-/-)) to show that MDA5 and RIG-I recognize different types of dsRNAs: MDA5 recognizes poly(I:C), and RIG-I detects in vitro transcribed dsRNAs. RNA viruses are also differentially recognized by RIG-I and MDA5. We find that RIG-I is essential for the production of interferons in response to RNA viruses including paramyxo-viruses, influenza virus and Japanese encephalitis virus, whereas MDA5 is critical for picornavirus detection. Furthermore, RIG-I-/- and MDA5(-/-) mice are highly susceptible to infection with these respective RNA viruses compared to control mice.

Each vector was engineered to contain a unique 60-base-pair 'bar code', allowing the abundance of an individual shRNA vector within a population of transduced cells to be measured using microarrays of the bar-code sequences. We observed that a subset of shRNA vectors was depleted from the transduced cells after three weeks in culture only if shRNA expression was induced. In activated B-cell-like DLBCL cells, but not germinal centre B-cell-like DLBCL cells, shRNAs targeting the NF-kappa B pathway were depleted, in keeping with the essential role of this pathway in the survival of activated B-cell-like DLBCL. This screen uncovered CARD11 as a key upstream signalling component responsible for the constitutive I kappa B kinase activity in activated B-cell-like DLBCL. The methodology that we describe can be used to establish a functional taxonomy of cancer and help reveal new classes of therapeutic targets distinct from known oncogenes.","NCI, Metab Branch, Ctr Canc Res, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; CIT, Bioinformat & Mol Anal Sect, Computat Biosci & Engn Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Staudt, LM (reprint author), NCI, Metab Branch, Ctr Canc Res, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",lstaudt@mail.nih.gov,"Lenz, Georg/I-6844-2012",,Intramural NIH HHS,,,30,395,414,3,33,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-May,2006,441,7089,,,,,106,110,,10.1038/nature04687,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,038TB,WOS:000237248600042,16572121.0,No,,,11/20/17,lm,staudt,female,0.71,7,na,na

Although there are numerous examples of in vivo silencing of target genes after local delivery of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs)(3-5), there remain only a few reports of RNAi-mediated silencing in response to systemic delivery of siRNA(6-8), and there are no reports of systemic efficacy in non-rodent species. Here we show that siRNAs, when delivered systemically in a liposomal formulation, can silence the disease target apolipoprotein B (ApoB) in non-human primates. APOB-specific siRNAs were encapsulated in stable nucleic acid lipid particles (SNALP) and administered by intravenous injection to cynomolgus monkeys at doses of 1 or 2.5 mg kg(-1). A single siRNA injection resulted in dose-dependent silencing of APOB messenger RNA expression in the liver 48 h after administration, with maximal silencing of >90%. This silencing effect occurred as a result of APOB mRNA cleavage at precisely the site predicted for the RNAi mechanism. Significant reductions in ApoB protein, serum cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein levels were observed as early as 24 h after treatment and lasted for 11 days at the highest siRNA dose, thus demonstrating an immediate, potent and lasting biological effect of siRNA treatment. Our findings show clinically relevant RNAi-mediated gene silencing in non-human primates, supporting RNAi therapeutics as a potential new class of drugs.","Alnylam Pharmaceut Inc, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; Protiva Biotherapeut Inc, Burnaby, BC V5G 4Y1, Canada; Alnylam Europe AG, D-95326 Kulmbach, Germany","Zimmermann, TS (reprint author), Alnylam Pharmaceut Inc, 300 3rd St, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",tzimmermann@alnylam.com; ian@protivabio.com,,,,,,19,893,939,8,118,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-May,2006,441,7089,,,,,111,114,,10.1038/nature04688,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,038TB,WOS:000237248600043,16565705.0,No,,,11/20/17,i,maclachlan,na,na,na,na,na

One regulatory mechanism is the depolymerization of microtubules by motor proteins in the kinesin-13 family(1). These proteins are crucial for the control of microtubule length in cell division(2-4), neuronal development(5) and interphase microtubule dynamics(6,7). The mechanism by which kinesin-13 proteins depolymerize microtubules is poorly understood. A central question is how these proteins target to microtubule ends at rates exceeding those of standard enzyme-substrate kinetics(8). To address this question we developed a single-molecule microscopy assay for MCAK, the founding member of the kinesin-13 family(9). Here we show that MCAK moves along the microtubule lattice in a one-dimensional (1D) random walk. MCAK-microtubule interactions were transient: the average MCAK molecule diffused for 0.83 s with a diffusion coefficient of 0.38 mu m(2) s(-1). Although the catalytic depolymerization by MCAK requires the hydrolysis of ATP, we found that the diffusion did not. The transient transition from three-dimensional diffusion to 1D diffusion corresponds to a ""reduction in dimensionality""(10) that has been proposed as the search strategy by which DNA enzymes find specific binding sites(11). We show that MCAK uses this strategy to target to both microtubule ends more rapidly than direct binding from solution.","Max Planck Inst Mol Cell Biol & Genet, D-01307 Dresden, Germany; Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, AN Belozersky Inst Physicochem Biol, Moscow 119899, Russia","Howard, J (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Mol Cell Biol & Genet, D-01307 Dresden, Germany.",howard@mpi-cbg.de,"Howard, Jonathon /D-4229-2011; Diez, Stefan/E-8172-2010; Kalaidzidis, Yannis/H-3094-2016; Howard, Jonathon/J-7492-2016","Howard, Jonathon /0000-0003-0086-1196; Diez, Stefan/0000-0002-0750-8515; Kalaidzidis, Yannis/0000-0002-6137-1193; Howard, Jonathon/0000-0003-0086-1196",,,,30,261,270,3,42,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-May,2006,441,7089,,,,,115,119,,10.1038/nature04736,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,038TB,WOS:000237248600044,16672973.0,No,,,11/20/17,j,howard,male,0.83,122,na,na

The efficiency with which bacteria incorporate genetic information reflects their capacity to adapt to changing environmental conditions. Integron integrases are proteins that mediate site-specific DNA recombination between a proximal primary site (attI) and a secondary target site (attC) found within mobile gene cassettes encoding resistance or virulence factors. The lack of sequence conservation among attC sites has led to the hypothesis that a sequence-independent structural recognition determinant must exist within attC. Here we report the crystal structure of an integron integrase bound to an attC substrate. The structure shows that DNA target site recognition and high-order synaptic assembly are not dependent on canonical DNA but on the position of two flipped-out bases that interact in cis and in trans with the integrase. These extrahelical bases, one of which is required for recombination in vivo, originate from folding of the bottom strand of attC owing to its imperfect internal dyad symmetry.

A problem with this mechanism, however, is that the orbital planes of regular satellites would probably be uncorrelated with the obliquities, contrary to observations(6,7). Alternatively, they could have come from an external twist that affected the orientation of the Solar System plane(2); but in this model, the outer planets must have formed too rapidly, before the event that produced the twist(8). Moreover, the model cannot be quantitatively tested. Here I show that the present obliquities of the giant planets were probably achieved when Jupiter and Saturn crossed the 1:2 orbital resonance(9) during a specific migration process: different migration scenarios cannot account for the large observed obliquities. The existence of the regular satellites of the giant planets does not represent a problem in this model because, although they formed soon after the planetary formation, they can follow the slow evolution of the equatorial plane it produces.","Natl Univ La Plata, Fac Ciencias Astron & Geofis, RA-1900 La Plata, Argentina; Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Inst Astrofis La Plata, RA-1900 La Plata, Argentina","Brunini, A (reprint author), Natl Univ La Plata, Fac Ciencias Astron & Geofis, Paseo Bosque S-N, RA-1900 La Plata, Argentina.",abrunini@fcaglp.unlp.edu.ar,,,,,,23,7,7,0,6,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Apr,2006,440,7088,,,,,1163,1165,,10.1038/nature04577,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,036OG,WOS:000237080000038,16641989.0,No,,,11/20/17,a,brunini,male,0.59,56,na,na

New and unique features such as fractal-like band structures(4-7) and 'phason' degrees of freedom(8) are introduced. In general, it is very difficult to directly observe the evolution of electronic waves in solid-state atomic quasicrystals, or the dynamics of the structure itself. Here we use optical induction(9-11) to create two-dimensional photonic quasicrystals, whose macroscopic nature allows us to explore wave transport phenomena. We demonstrate that light launched at different quasicrystal sites travels through the lattice in a way equivalent to quantum tunnelling of electrons in a quasiperiodic potential. At high intensity, lattice solitons are formed. Finally, we directly observe dislocation dynamics when crystal sites are allowed to interact with each other. Our experimental results apply not only to photonics, but also to other quasiperiodic systems such as matter waves in quasiperiodic traps(12), generic pattern-forming systems as in parametrically excited surface waves(13), liquid quasicrystals(14), and the more familiar atomic quasicrystals.","Technion Israel Inst Technol, Dept Phys, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel; Technion Israel Inst Technol, Inst Solid State, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel; Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Phys & Astron, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; Univ Cent Florida, Coll Opt & Photon, Orlando, FL 32816 USA; Princeton Univ, Princeton Inst Sci & Technol Mat, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; Princeton Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Segev, M (reprint author), Technion Israel Inst Technol, Dept Phys, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel.",msegev@techunix.technion.ac.il,"Lifshitz, Ron/A-7775-2008","Lifshitz, Ron/0000-0002-8829-5506",,,,30,164,166,6,63,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Apr,2006,440,7088,,,,,1166,1169,,10.1038/nature04722,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,036OG,WOS:000237080000039,16641990.0,No,,,11/20/17,jw,fleischer,male,0.91,11,na,na

Many believe that antiferromagnetism is important for superconductivity, but there has been renewed interest in the possible role of electron-lattice coupling(1-4). The conventional superconductor MgB2 has a very strong electron-lattice coupling, involving a particular vibrational mode (phonon) that was predicted by standard theory and confirmed quantitatively by experiment(5). Here we present inelastic scattering measurements that show a similarly strong anomaly in the Cu-O bond-stretching phonon in the copper oxide superconductors La2-xSrxCuO4 (with x=0.07, 0.15). Conventional theory does not predict such behaviour. The anomaly is strongest in La1.875Ba0.125CuO4 and La1.48Nd0.4Sr0.12CuO4, compounds that exhibit spatially modulated charge and magnetic order, often called stripe order(6); it occurs at a wave vector corresponding to the charge order. These results suggest that this giant electron-phonon anomaly, which is absent in undoped and over-doped non-superconductors, is associated with charge inhomogeneity. It follows that electron-phonon coupling may be important to our understanding of superconductivity, although its contribution is likely to be indirect.","Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe, Inst Festkorperphys, D-76021 Karlsruhe, Germany; Ctr Etud Saclay, Leon Brillouin Lab, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; Nagoya Univ, Dept Phys, Div Sci Mat, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648602, Japan; Tohoku Univ, Inst Mat Res, Aoba Ku, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan; Brookhaven Natl Lab, Condensed Matter Phys & Mat Sci, Upton, NY 11973 USA","Reznik, D (reprint author), Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe, Inst Festkorperphys, POB 3640, D-76021 Karlsruhe, Germany.",Reznik@llb.saclay.cea.fr,"Tranquada, John/A-9832-2009; Yamada, Kazuyoshi/C-2728-2009; Gu, Genda/D-5410-2013; Fujita, Masaki/D-8430-2013","Tranquada, John/0000-0003-4984-8857; Gu, Genda/0000-0002-9886-3255; ",,,,30,205,206,3,47,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,27-Apr,2006,440,7088,,,,,1170,1173,,10.1038/nature04704,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,036OG,WOS:000237080000040,16641991.0,No,,,11/20/17,jm,tranquada,male,0.83,126,na,na

First proposed theoretically in 1934 (refs 1-3) to explain low magnitudes of crystal strength observed experimentally, the existence of dislocations was confirmed two decades later(4,5). Much of the research in dislocation physics has since focused on dislocation interactions and their role in strain hardening, a common phenomenon in which continued deformation increases a crystal's strength. The existing theory relates strain hardening to pair-wise dislocation reactions in which two intersecting dislocations form junctions that tie the dislocations together(6,7). Here we report that interactions among three dislocations result in the formation of unusual elements of dislocation network topology, termed 'multi-junctions'. We first predict the existence of multi-junctions using dislocation dynamics and atomistic simulations and then confirm their existence by transmission electron microscopy experiments in single-crystal molybdenum. In large-scale dislocation dynamics simulations, multi-junctions present very strong, nearly indestructible, obstacles to dislocation motion and furnish new sources for dislocation multiplication, thereby playing an essential role in the evolution of dislocation microstructure and strength of deforming crystals(8).

Despite the co-variability of both of these climate variables(3), attention in long-term climate reconstruction has mainly concentrated on temperature changes(4-8). Here we present an annually resolved oxygen isotope record from tree-rings, providing a millennial-scale reconstruction of precipitation variability in the high mountains of northern Pakistan. The climatic signal originates mainly from winter precipitation, and is robust over ecologically different sites. Centennial-scale variations reveal dry conditions at the beginning of the past millennium and through the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, with precipitation increasing during the late nineteenth and the twentieth centuries to yield the wettest conditions of the past 1,000 years.

The latter are currently regarded as more closely related to the living jawed vertebrates (crown gnathostomes) than to the living jawless vertebrates (hagfish and lampreys, or cyclostomes)(2,3). Here we report the first direct evidence for the position of the gill filaments-possibly supported by gill rays-enclosed by gill pouches in a 370-million year (Myr)-old jawless vertebrate, Endeiolepis, from the Late Devonian fossil fish site of Miguasha, Quebec, Canada. This extinct jawless fish has much the same gill organization as living lampreys, although it possesses an unusually large number of gill pouches-a condition unlike that in any extant vertebrates and that raises questions about gill development(4).

Assuming that current vertebrate phylogeny is correct, this discovery demonstrates that pouches enclosing the gills are primitive for vertebrates, but have been subsequently lost in jawed vertebrates.","Museum Natl Hist Nat, CNRS, UMR 5143, F-75231 Paris 05, France; Nat Hist Museum, London SW7 5BD, England; Parc Natl Miguasha, Nouvelle, PQ G0C 2E0, Canada","Janvier, P (reprint author), Museum Natl Hist Nat, CNRS, UMR 5143, CP38,57 Rue Cuvier, F-75231 Paris 05, France.",janvier@mnhn.fr,,,,,,22,29,31,0,15,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Apr,2006,440,7088,,,,,1183,1185,,10.1038/nature04471,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,036OG,WOS:000237080000043,16641994.0,No,,,11/20/17,m,arsenault,male,0.74,158,na,na

With continued global warming, bleaching events are predicted to increase in frequency and severity, causing up to 60% coral mortality globally within the next few decades(4-6). Although some corals are able to recover and to survive bleaching(7,8), the mechanisms underlying such resilience are poorly understood. Here we show that the coral host has a significant role in recovery and resilience. Bleached and recovering Montipora capitata (branching) corals met more than 100% of their daily metabolic energy requirements by markedly increasing their feeding rates and CHAR (per cent contribution of heterotrophically acquired carbon to daily animal respiration), whereas Porites compressa (branching) and Porites lobata (mounding) corals did not. These findings suggest that coral species with high-CHAR capability during bleaching and recovery, irrespective of morphology, will be more resilient to bleaching events over the long term, could become the dominant coral species on reefs, and may help to safeguard affected reefs from potential local and global extinction.","Ohio State Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; Villanova Univ, Dept Biol, Villanova, PA 19085 USA; Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA","Grottoli, AG (reprint author), Ohio State Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",grottoli.1@osu.edu,"Rodrigues, Lisa/A-2541-2009; Grottoli, Andrea/C-9736-2009",,,,,28,286,292,14,115,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Apr,2006,440,7088,,,,,1186,1189,,10.1038/nature04565,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,036OG,WOS:000237080000044,16641995.0,No,,,11/20/17,je,palardy,male,0.51,39,na,na

Maternal effects mediated by prenatal hormone exposure are potentially important for non-genetic inheritance of phenotypic traits related to social rank(3), and thus for shaping individual variation in behaviour and social structure. Here we show that androgen concentrations in wild female spotted hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta) are higher during late gestation in dominant females than in subordinate females. Furthermore, both male and female cubs born to mothers with high concentrations of androgens in late pregnancy exhibit higher rates of aggression and mounting behaviour than cubs born to mothers with lower androgen concentrations. Both behaviours are strongly affected in other mammals by organizational effects of androgens(4), and both have important effects on fitness in hyaenas. Therefore, our results suggest that rank-related maternal effects of prenatal androgen exposure can adaptively influence offspring phenotype in mammals, as has previously been shown to occur in birds. They also suggest an organizational mechanism for the development of female dominance and aggressiveness in spotted hyaenas, traits that may offset the costs of extreme virilization.","Michigan State Univ, Dept Zool, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; Univ Nebraska, Dept Psychol, Omaha, NE 68182 USA; Univ Nebraska, Dept Biol, Omaha, NE 68182 USA","Dloniak, SM (reprint author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Zool, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",dloniak@kenyaweb.co,"French, Jeffrey/F-1779-2011; Holekamp, Kay/G-6054-2010","French, Jeffrey/0000-0001-5304-1592",,,,27,90,92,1,85,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Apr,2006,440,7088,,,,,1190,1193,,10.1038/nature04540,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,036OG,WOS:000237080000045,16641996.0,No,,,11/20/17,ke,holekamp,male,0.56,34,na,na

However, until now there has been no evidence for the pluripotency and plasticity of adult spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs), which are responsible for maintaining spermatogenesis throughout life in the male(3). Here we show the isolation of SSCs from adult mouse testis using genetic selection, with a success rate of 27%. These isolated SSCs respond to culture conditions and acquire embryonic stem cell properties. We name these cells multipotent adult germline stem cells (maGSCs). They are able to spontaneously differentiate into derivatives of the three embryonic germ layers in vitro and generate teratomas in immunodeficient mice. When injected into an early blastocyst, SSCs contribute to the development of various organs and show germline transmission. Thus, the capacity to form multipotent cells persists in adult mouse testis. Establishment of human maGSCs from testicular biopsies may allow individual cell-based therapy without the ethical and immunological problems associated with human embryonic stem cells.

Linguistic theories account for this ability through the use of syntactic rules (or generative grammars) that describe the acceptable structure of utterances(2). The recursive, hierarchical embedding of language units (for example, words or phrases within shorter sentences) that is part of the ability to construct new utterances minimally requires a 'context-free' grammar(2,3) that is more complex than the 'finite-state' grammars thought sufficient to specify the structure of all non-human communication signals. Recent hypotheses make the central claim that the capacity for syntactic recursion forms the computational core of a uniquely human language faculty(4,5). Here we show that European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) accurately recognize acoustic patterns defined by a recursive, self-embedding, context-free grammar. They are also able to classify new patterns defined by the grammar and reliably exclude agrammatical patterns. Thus, the capacity to classify sequences from recursive, centre-embedded grammars is not uniquely human.

Modest cleavage activity can be generated by reconstituting these four proteins in yeast and Spodoptera frugiperda (sf9) cells(12-14). However, a critical but unanswered question about the biology of the presenilin complexes is how their activity is modulated in terms of substrate specificity and/or relative activities at the gamma and epsilon sites. A corollary to this question is whether additional proteins in the presenilin complexes might subsume these putative regulatory functions. The hypothesis that additional proteins might exist in the presenilin complexes is supported by the fact that enzymatically active complexes have a mass that is much greater than predicted for a 1:1:1:1 stoichiometric complex (at least 650 kDa observed, compared with about 220 kDa predicted)(6-8). To address these questions we undertook a search for presenilin-interacting proteins that differentially affected gamma- and epsilon-site cleavage events.

Conserved from bacteria to humans(1), the voltage-gated-ligand superfamily of ion channels are encoded as polypeptide chains of six transmembrane-spanning segments (S1-S6). S1-S4 functions as a self-contained voltage-sensing domain (VSD), in essence a positively charged lever that moves in response to voltage changes. The VSD 'ligand' transmits force via a linker to the S5-S6 pore domain 'receptor'(2), thereby opening or closing the channel. The ascidian VSD protein Ci-VSP gates a phosphatase activity rather than a channel pore, indicating that VSDs function independently of ion channels(3). Here we describe a mammalian VSD protein (H(V)1) that lacks a discernible pore domain but is sufficient for expression of a voltage-sensitive proton-selective ion channel activity. H(v)1 currents are activated at depolarizing voltages, sensitive to the transmembrane pH gradient, H+-selective, and Zn2+-sensitive. Mutagenesis of H(v)1 identified three arginine residues in S4 that regulate channel gating and two histidine residues that are required for extracellular inhibition of H(v)1 by Zn2+. H(v)1 is expressed in immune tissues and manifests the characteristic properties of native proton conductances (G(vH+)). In phagocytic leukocytes(4), G(vH+) are required to support the oxidative burst that underlies microbial killing by the innate immune system(4,5). The data presented here identify H(v)1 as a long-sought voltage-gated H+ channel and establish H(v)1 as the founding member of a family of mammalian VSD proteins.","Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Childrens Hosp,Dept Cardiol,Howard Hughes Med Ins, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Clapham, DE (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Childrens Hosp,Dept Cardiol,Howard Hughes Med Ins, Enders 1309,320 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",dclapham@enders.tch.harvard.edu,,,Howard Hughes Medical Institute,,,30,323,328,4,36,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Apr,2006,440,7088,,,,,1213,1216,,10.1038/nature04700,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,036OG,WOS:000237080000050,16554753.0,No,,,11/20/17,de,clapham,male,0.68,147,na,na

Large infarct size increases immediate morbidity and mortality and, in survivors of the acute event, larger non-functional scars adversely affect long-term prognosis. There is thus an important unmet medical need for new cardioprotective and neuroprotective treatments. We have previously shown that human C-reactive protein (CRP), the classical acute-phase protein that binds to ligands exposed in damaged tissue and then activates complement(1), increases myocardial and cerebral infarct size in rats subjected to coronary or cerebral artery ligation, respectively(2,3). Rat CRP does not activate rat complement, whereas human CRP activates both rat and human complement(4). Administration of human CRP to rats is thus an excellent model for the actions of endogenous human CRP(2,3). Here we report the design, synthesis and efficacy of 1,6-bis(phosphocholine)-hexane as a specific small-molecule inhibitor of CRP. Five molecules of this palindromic compound are bound by two pentameric CRP molecules, crosslinking and occluding the ligand-binding B-face of CRP and blocking its functions. Administration of 1,6-bis(phosphocholine)-hexane to rats undergoing acute myocardial infarction abrogated the increase in infarct size and cardiac dysfunction produced by injection of human CRP. Therapeutic inhibition of CRP is thus a promising new approach to cardioprotection in acute myocardial infarction, and may also provide neuroprotection in stroke. Potential wider applications include other inflammatory, infective and tissue-damaging conditions characterized by increased CRP production, in which binding of CRP to exposed ligands in damaged cells may lead to complement-mediated exacerbation of tissue injury.","UCL, Royal Free & Univ Coll Med Sch, Dept Med, Ctr Amyloidosis & Acute Phase Prot, London NW3 2PF, England; Univ Cambridge, Dept Chem, Cambridge CB2 1EW, England; Univ Edinburgh, Ctr Cardiovasc Sci, Endothelial Cell & Mol Cardiol Grp, Edinburgh EH16 4TJ, Midlothian, Scotland; UCL, Royal Free & Univ Coll Med Sch, Dept Primary Care & Populat Sci, London NW3 2PF, England; Univ Southampton, Sch Biol Sci, Southampton SO16 7PX, Hants, England","Pepys, MB (reprint author), UCL, Royal Free & Univ Coll Med Sch, Dept Med, Ctr Amyloidosis & Acute Phase Prot, Rowland Hill St, London NW3 2PF, England.",m.pepys@medsch.ucl.ac.uk,"; Hawkins, Philip/C-5573-2008; Kolstoe, Simon/A-4150-2009; Wood, Stephen/B-1438-2009; Gray, Gillian/B-4058-2014; Bellotti, Vittorio/A-6201-2014; Aquilina, J.

Hypoxia (low oxygen) is clinically associated with metastasis and poor patient outcome, although the underlying processes remain unclear(2). Microarray studies have shown the expression of lysyl oxidase (LOX) to be elevated in hypoxic human tumour cells(3). Paradoxically, LOX expression is associated with both tumour suppression and tumour progression, and its role in tumorigenesis seems dependent on cellular location, cell type and transformation status(4-9). Here we show that LOX expression is regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and is associated with hypoxia in human breast and head and neck tumours. Patients with high LOX-expressing tumours have poor distant metastasis-free and overall survivals. Inhibition of LOX eliminates metastasis in mice with orthotopically grown breast cancer tumours. Mechanistically, secreted LOX is responsible for the invasive properties of hypoxic human cancer cells through focal adhesion kinase activity and cell to matrix adhesion. Furthermore, LOX may be required to create a niche permissive for metastatic growth. Our findings indicate that LOX is essential for hypoxia-induced metastasis and is a good therapeutic target for preventing and treating metastases.","Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Radiat Oncol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Surg, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Univ Leipzig, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; Duke Univ, Dept Mol Genet & Microbiol, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Giaccia, AJ (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Radiat Oncol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",giaccia@stanford.edu,,"Erler, Janine/0000-0001-8675-6527",NCI NIH HHS [T32 CA009151],,,29,787,814,10,91,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Apr,2006,440,7088,,,,,1222,1226,,10.1038/nature04695,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,036OG,WOS:000237080000052,16642001.0,No,,,11/20/17,aj,giaccia,male,0.81,278,na,na

Kinetic(3-6) and theoretical considerations suggest that significant rate enhancement can be achieved either by reducing the dimensionality of the search process(1,7) or by the creation of a short-range attractive potential around the target site(2). This implies the existence of transient intermediates involving non-specific binding modes. Here we show that intermolecular paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) provides a means of directly detecting the presence of, and investigating the nature of, low population transient intermediates under equilibrium conditions. Applying this approach, we characterize the search process whereby a sequence-specific transcription factor (the homeodomain of HOXD9) binds to non-cognate DNA sites as a means of enhancing the rate of specific association. The PRE data in the fast exchange regime reveal the presence of transient intermediates formed in a stochastic manner at non-cognate sites whose structure is similar to that of the specific complex. Two distinct search processes involving intra- as well as intermolecular translocations can be delineated. The intermolecular PRE method is general and can be readily applied to investigations of transient intermediates in many other macromolecular binding processes.","NIDDKD, Chem Phys Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Clore, GM (reprint author), NIDDKD, Chem Phys Lab, NIH, Bldg 2, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",mariusc@intra.niddk.nih.gov,"Clore, G.

Successful analysis thus depends on simplifying hypotheses, but experiments on many systems hint that complicated, higher-order interactions among large groups of elements have an important role. Here we show, in the vertebrate retina, that weak correlations between pairs of neurons coexist with strongly collective behaviour in the responses of ten or more neurons. We find that this collective behaviour is described quantitatively by models that capture the observed pairwise correlations but assume no higher-order interactions. These maximum entropy models are equivalent to Ising models, and predict that larger networks are completely dominated by correlation effects. This suggests that the neural code has associative or error-correcting properties, and we provide preliminary evidence for such behaviour. As a first test for the generality of these ideas, we show that similar results are obtained from networks of cultured cortical neurons.","Princeton Univ, Joseph Henry Labs Phys, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; Princeton Univ, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; Princeton Univ, Lewis Sigler Inst Integrat Genom, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Schneidman, E (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Joseph Henry Labs Phys, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",elads@princeton.edu,,"Segev, Ronen/0000-0002-8109-1076; schneidman, elad/0000-0001-8653-9848",NEI NIH HHS [R01 EY014196],,,43,671,676,4,68,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Apr,2006,440,7087,,,,,1007,1012,,10.1038/nature04701,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,034DL,WOS:000236906000026,16625187.0,No,,,11/20/17,w,bialek,male,0.71,7,na,na

The structure reveals the complex architecture of the 'closed' state of the Hsp90 chaperone, the extensive interactions between domains and between protein chains, the detailed conformational changes in the amino-terminal domain that accompany ATP binding, and the structural basis for stabilization of the closed state by p23/Sba1.

Direct measurements are difficult and not yet conclusive, owing to the large uncertainties caused by the bright foreground emission associated with zodiacal light(1). An alternative approach(2-5) is to study the absorption features imprinted on the gamma-ray spectra of distant extragalactic objects by interactions of those photons with the background light photons(6). Here we report the discovery of gamma-ray emission from the blazars(7) H 2356-309 and 1ES 1101-232, at redshifts z=0.165 and z=0.186, respectively. Their unexpectedly hard spectra provide an upper limit on the background light at optical/near-infrared wavelengths that appears to be very close to the lower limit given by the integrated light of resolved galaxies(8). The background flux at these wavelengths accordingly seems to be strongly dominated by the direct starlight from galaxies, thus excluding a large contribution from other sources-in particular from the first stars formed(9).

Such methods are fundamentally different from entanglement measures that, by definition, quantify the amount of entanglement in any state. However, these measures suffer from the severe disadvantage that they typically are not directly accessible in laboratory experiments. Here we report a linear optics experiment in which we directly observe a pure-state entanglement measure, namely concurrence(6).

This is the phenomenon of 'confinement', a concept at odds with the conventional theory of solids, and recognized(1) as due to magnetic and electron-lattice interactions within the layers that must be overcome at a substantial energy cost if electrons are to be transferred between layers. The associated energy gap, or 'pseudogap', is particularly obvious in experiments where charge is moved perpendicular to the planes, most notably scanning tunnelling microscopy(2) and polarized infrared spectroscopy(3). Here, using the same experimental tools, we show that there is a second family of transition-metal oxides-the layered manganites La(2-2x)Sr(1+2x)Mn(2)O(7)-with even more extreme confinement and pseudogap effects. The data demonstrate quantitatively that because the charge carriers are attached to polarons (lattice- and spin-textures within the planes), it is as difficult to remove them from the planes through vacuum-tunnelling into a conventional metallic tip, as it is for them to move between Mn-rich layers within the material itself.","UCL, London Ctr Nanotechnol, London WC1E 6BT, England; ETH, Neutron Scattering Lab, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland; Paul Scherrer Inst, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland; UCL, Dept Phys & Astron, London WC1E 6BT, England; Lucent Technol, Bell Labs, Murray Hill, NJ 07974 USA; Univ Tokyo, Dept Appl Phys, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138656, Japan; Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, ERATO, Spin Superstruct Project, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050046, Japan","Renner, C (reprint author), UCL, London Ctr Nanotechnol, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",c.renner@ucl.ac.uk,"Tokura, Yoshinori/C-7352-2009; Renner, Christoph/B-6140-2013; Ronnow, Henrik/A-4953-2009","Renner, Christoph/0000-0001-9882-681X; Ronnow, Henrik/0000-0002-8832-8865",,,,31,69,69,5,48,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Apr,2006,440,7087,,,,,1025,1028,,10.1038/nature04650,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,034DL,WOS:000236906000030,16625191.0,No,,,11/20/17,y,tokura,na,na,na,na,na

A number of observational studies(3-10), however, find a substantial probability of significantly higher sensitivities, yielding upper limits on climate sensitivity of 7.7 K to above 9 K (refs 3-8). Here we demonstrate that such observational estimates of climate sensitivity can be tightened if reconstructions of Northern Hemisphere temperature over the past several centuries are considered. We use large-ensemble energy balance modelling and simulate the temperature response to past solar, volcanic and greenhouse gas forcing to determine which climate sensitivities yield simulations that are in agreement with proxy reconstructions. After accounting for the uncertainty in reconstructions and estimates of past external forcing, we find an independent estimate of climate sensitivity that is very similar to those from instrumental data. If the latter are combined with the result from all proxy reconstructions, then the 5-95 per cent range shrinks to 1.5-6.2 K, thus substantially reducing the probability of very high climate sensitivity.","Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Div Earth & Ocean Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA; Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Climate Dynam Grp, Oxford OX1 3PU, England","Hegerl, GC (reprint author), Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Div Earth & Ocean Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",hegerl@duke.edu,"Frame, Dave/A-8918-2014; Frame, Dave/R-6169-2016","Frame, Dave/0000-0002-0949-3994",,,,30,230,242,3,41,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,20-Apr,2006,440,7087,,,,,1029,1032,,10.1038/nature04679,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,034DL,WOS:000236906000031,16625192.0,No,,,11/20/17,dj,frame,male,0.93,40,na,na

Such knowledge is critical to understanding ice flow, basal water transfer to the ice margin, glacial landform development and subglacial lake habitats. Here we present ice-sheet surface elevation changes in central East Antarctica that we interpret to represent rapid discharge from a subglacial lake. Our observations indicate that during a period of 16 months, 1.8 km(3) of water was transferred over 290 km to at least two other subglacial lakes. While viscous deformation of the ice roof above may moderate discharge, the intrinsic instability of such a system(3) suggests that discharge events are a common mode of basal drainage(4). If large lakes, such as Lake Vostok or Lake Concordia(1), are pressurizing, it is possible that substantial discharges could reach the coast(5,6). Our observations conflict with expectations that subglacial lakes have long residence times and slow circulations(2,7,8), and we suggest that entire subglacial drainage basins may be flushed periodically. The rapid transfer of water between lakes would result in large-scale solute and microbe relocation, and drainage system contamination from in situ exploration is, therefore, a distinct risk.","UCL, Dept Space & Climate Phys, Ctr Polar Observat & Modelling, London WC1E 6BT, England; Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol Glaciol Ctr, Ctr Polar Observat & Modelling, Bristol BS8 1SS, Avon, England; Univ Cambridge, Scott Polar Res Inst, Ctr Polar Observat & Modelling, Cambridge CB2 1ER, England","Wingham, DJ (reprint author), UCL, Dept Space & Climate Phys, Ctr Polar Observat & Modelling, Pearson Bldg,Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",djw@cpom.ucl.ac.uk; m.j.siegert@bristol.ac.uk,"Siegert, Martin/A-3826-2008","Siegert, Martin/0000-0002-0090-4806",,,,20,226,241,3,64,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,20-Apr,2006,440,7087,,,,,1033,1036,,10.1038/nature04660,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,034DL,WOS:000236906000032,16625193.0,No,,,11/20/17,as,muir,male,0.9,63,na,na

However, recent developmental and palaeontological discoveries suggest a more complex scenario of limb reduction, still poorly documented in the fossil record(2-5). Here we report a fossil snake with a sacrum supporting a pelvic girdle and robust, functional legs outside the ribcage. The new fossil, from the Upper Cretaceous period of Patagonia, fills an important gap in the evolutionary progression towards limblessness because other known fossil snakes with developed hindlimbs, the marine Haasiophis, Pachyrhachis and Eupodophis, lack a sacral region. Phylogenetic analysis shows that the new fossil is the most primitive (basal) snake known and that all other limbed fossil snakes are closer to the more advanced macrostomatan snakes, a group including boas, pythons and colubroids. The new fossil retains several features associated with a subterranean or surface dwelling life that are also present in primitive extant snake lineages, supporting the hypothesis of a terrestrial rather than marine origin of snakes.","Museo Argentino Ciencias Nat Bernardino Rivadavia, RA-1405 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; Univ Maimonides, Fdn Hist Nat Felix de Azara CEBBAD, RA-1405 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; Univ Sao Paulo, Museu Zool, BR-04263000 Sao Paulo, Brazil","Apesteguia, S (reprint author), Museo Argentino Ciencias Nat Bernardino Rivadavia, A Gallardo 470, RA-1405 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",paleoninja@yahoo.com.ar; hzaher@ib.usp.br,"Zaher, Hussam/D-4000-2012; Museu de Zoologia da USP, MZ-USP/Q-2192-2016","Zaher, Hussam/0000-0002-6994-489X; ",,,,20,84,91,2,49,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Apr,2006,440,7087,,,,,1037,1040,,10.1038/nature04413,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,034DL,WOS:000236906000033,16625194.0,No,,,11/20/17,h,zaher,male,0.85,13,na,na

General outlines of the answer to this puzzle are currently emerging as a result of developments in the theories of kin selection(1-7), reciprocity(8-10), multilevel selection(11-15) and cultural group selection(16,17). The main conceptual tool used in probing the logical coherence of proposed explanations has been game theory, including both analytical models and agent-based simulations(6,7,9,18-24). The game-theoretic approach yields clear-cut results but assumes, as a rule, a simple structure of payoffs and a small set of possible strategies. Here we propose a more stringent test of the theory by developing a computer model with a considerably extended spectrum of possible strategies. In our model, agents are endowed with a limited set of receptors, a set of elementary actions and a neural net in between. Behavioural strategies are not predetermined; instead, the process of evolution constructs and reconstructs them from elementary actions. Two new strategies of cooperative attack and defence emerge in simulations, as well as the well-known dove, hawk and bourgeois strategies. Our results indicate that cooperative strategies can evolve even under such minimalist assumptions, provided that agents are capable of perceiving heritable external markers of other agents.","RAS, MV Keldysh Appl Math Inst, Dept Nonlinear Dynam, Moscow 125047, Russia; Univ Connecticut, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Storrs, CT 06269 USA","Burtsev, M (reprint author), RAS, MV Keldysh Appl Math Inst, Dept Nonlinear Dynam, Moscow 125047, Russia.",mbur@narod.ru,"Burtsev, Mikhail/G-6293-2010","Burtsev, Mikhail/0000-0003-1614-1695",,,,29,29,34,4,25,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Apr,2006,440,7087,,,,,1041,1044,,10.1038/nature04470,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,034DL,WOS:000236906000034,16625195.0,No,,,11/20/17,p,turchin,male,0.67,6,na,na

It is the largest human autosome with orthology to only a single mouse chromosome(1), mapping entirely to the distal half of mouse chromosome 11. Chromosome 17 is rich in protein-coding genes, having the second highest gene density in the genome(2,3). It is also enriched in segmental duplications, ranking third in density among the autosomes(4). Here we report a finished sequence for human chromosome 17, as well as a structural comparison with the finished sequence for mouse chromosome 11, the first finished mouse chromosome. Comparison of the orthologous regions reveals striking differences. In contrast to the typical pattern seen in mammalian evolution(5,6), the human sequence has undergone extensive intrachromosomal rearrangement, whereas the mouse sequence has been remarkably stable. Moreover, although the human sequence has a high density of segmental duplication, the mouse sequence has a very low density. Notably, these segmental duplications correspond closely to the sites of structural rearrangement, demonstrating a link between duplication and rearrangement. Examination of the main classes of duplicated segments provides insight into the dynamics underlying expansion of chromosome-specific, low-copy repeats in the human genome.","MIT, Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Cambridge CB10 1SA, England; Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Human Genet, Houston, TX 77030 USA; Childrens Hosp Oakland, Res Inst, BACPAC Resources, Oakland, CA 94609 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Lab Mol & Computat Genom, Madison, WI 53706 USA; UCL, Dept Biol, Galton Lab, HUGO Gene Nomenclature Comm, London NW1 2HE, England","Zody, MC (reprint author), MIT, Broad Inst, 7 Cambridge Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",mczody@broad.mit.edu; chad@broad.mit.edu,"Hubbard, Tim/C-2567-2008; McCarroll, Steven/A-8433-2009","Hubbard, Tim/0000-0002-1767-9318; Cuomo, Christina/0000-0002-5778-960X; Gilbert, James/0000-0001-8079-3159; Wilming, Laurens/0000-0002-4154-7358; Khodiyar, Varsha/0000-0002-2743-6918; DeCaprio, Dave/0000-0001-8931-9461; Gibson, Richard Charles/0000-0001-5412-1965","Medical Research Council [G0000107]; Wellcome Trust [, 077187]",,,27,84,754,0,16,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Apr,2006,440,7087,,,,,1045,1049,,10.1038/nature04689,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,034DL,WOS:000236906000035,16625196.0,No,,,11/20/17,c,nusbaum,male,0.74,27,na,na

For simple traits, such as overall body colour, repeated transitions by means of mutations in the same gene may be common(3-5). However, for more complex traits, the possible genetic paths may be more numerous; the molecular mechanisms underlying their independent origins and the extent to which they are constrained to follow certain genetic paths are largely unknown. Here we show that a male wing pigmentation pattern involved in courtship display has been gained and lost multiple times in a Drosophila clade. Each of the cases we have analysed (two gains and two losses) involved regulatory changes at the pleiotropic pigmentation gene yellow. Losses involved the parallel inactivation of the same cis-regulatory element (CRE), with changes at a few nucleotides sufficient to account for the functional divergence of one element between two sibling species. Surprisingly, two independent gains of wing spots resulted from the co-option of distinct ancestral CREs. These results demonstrate how the functional diversification of the modular CREs of pleiotropic genes contributes to evolutionary novelty and the independent evolution of morphological similarities.","Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA; Howard Hughes Med Inst, Bock Labs, Madison, WI 53706 USA; Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England; SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA","Carroll, SB (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, 1525 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",sbcarrol@wisc.edu,"Phelps, Steve/H-2263-2011; Rokas, Antonis/A-9775-2008","Rokas, Antonis/0000-0002-7248-6551",,,,29,282,288,3,52,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Apr,2006,440,7087,,,,,1050,1053,,10.1038/nature04597,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,034DL,WOS:000236906000036,16625197.0,No,,,11/20/17,sb,carroll,female,0.5,6,na,na

Without homeostatic synaptic scaling, neural networks can become unstable and perform suboptimally(1-3). Although much is known about the mechanisms underlying LTP and LTD4, little is known about the mechanisms responsible for synaptic scaling except that such scaling is due, at least in part, to alterations in receptor content at synapses(5-7). Here we show that synaptic scaling in response to prolonged blockade of activity is mediated by the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour-necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Using mixtures of wild-type and TNF-alpha-deficient neurons and glia, we also show that glia are the source of the TNF-alpha that is required for this form of synaptic scaling. We suggest that by modulating TNF-alpha levels, glia actively participate in the homeostatic activity-dependent regulation of synaptic connectivity.","Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Nancy Pritzker Lab, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA","Malenka, RC (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Nancy Pritzker Lab, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA.",malenka@stanford.edu,"yu, yan/C-2322-2012",,,,,30,762,778,1,48,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Apr,2006,440,7087,,,,,1054,1059,,10.1038/nature04671,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,034DL,WOS:000236906000037,16547515.0,No,,,11/20/17,rc,malenka,male,0.81,21,na,na

For all spiking neurons, the encoding of single-neuron computations into sequences of spikes is biophysically determined by the cell's action-potential-generating mechanism. It has recently been discovered that apparently minor modifications of this mechanism can qualitatively change the nature of neuronal encoding(3,4). Here we quantitatively analyse the dynamics of action potential initiation in cortical neurons in vivo, in vitro and in computational models. Unexpectedly, key features of the initiation dynamics of cortical neuron action potentials-their rapid initiation and variable onset potential are outside the range of behaviours described by the classical Hodgkin-Huxley theory. We propose a new model based on the cooperative activation of sodium channels that reproduces the observed dynamics of action potential initiation. This new model predicts that Hodgkin-Huxley-type dynamics of action potential initiation can be induced by artificially decreasing the effective density of sodium channels. In vitro experiments confirm this prediction, supporting the hypothesis that cooperative sodium channel activation underlies the dynamics of action potential initiation in cortical neurons.","Univ Gottingen, Max Planck Inst Dynam & Self Org, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; Univ Gottingen, Dept Phys, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; Univ Gottingen, Bernstein Ctr Computat Neurosci, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; Ruhr Univ Bochum, Dept Neurophysiol, D-44780 Bochum, Germany; Russian Acad Sci, Inst Higher Nervous Act & Neurophysiol, Moscow 117485, Russia","Wolf, F (reprint author), Univ Gottingen, Max Planck Inst Dynam & Self Org, Bunsenstr 10, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",fred@chaos.gwdg.de,"Wolf, Fred/D-5771-2011","Wolf, Fred/0000-0002-7068-3762",,,,18,171,173,1,48,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Apr,2006,440,7087,,,,,1060,1063,,10.1038/nature04610,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,034DL,WOS:000236906000038,16625198.0,No,,,11/20/17,m,volgushev,male,0.74,158,na,na
