Glucagon enhances glucose output from the liver during fasting by stimulating the transcription of gluconeogenic genes via the cyclic AMP-inducible factor CREB (CRE binding protein). When cellular ATP levels are low, however, the energy-sensing kinase AMPK inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis through an unknown mechanism. Here we show that hormonal and energy-sensing pathways converge on the coactivator TORC2 (transducer of regulated CREB activity 2) to modulate glucose output. Sequestered in the cytoplasm under feeding conditions, TORC2 is dephosphorylated and transported to the nucleus where it enhances CREB-dependent transcription in response to fasting stimuli. Conversely, signals that activate AMPK attenuate the gluconeogenic programme by promoting TORC2 phosphorylation and blocking its nuclear accumulation. Individuals with type 2 diabetes often exhibit fasting hyperglycaemia due to elevated gluconeogenesis; compounds that enhance TORC2 phosphorylation may offer therapeutic benefits in this setting.","Salk Inst Biol Studies, Peptide Biol Labs, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; St Jude Childrens Res Hosp, Dept Biochem, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Med H1, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan","Montminy, M (reprint author), Salk Inst Biol Studies, Peptide Biol Labs, 10010 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",montminy@salk.edu,"Boussouar, Faycal/N-2511-2013; Koo, Seung-Hoi/E-2763-2015","Koo, Seung-Hoi/0000-0001-8769-2879; Screaton, Robert/0000-0002-4917-9473; Qi, Ling/0000-0001-8229-0184; Brindle, Paul/0000-0001-7172-8478",,,,32,534,565,1,47,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,20-Oct,2005,437,7062,,,,,1109,1114,,10.1038/nature03967,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,975KD,WOS:000232660500034,16148943.0,No,,,11/20/17,m,montminy,male,0.74,158,na,na

The recent claimed detection of calcite associated with amorphous silicates in two planetary nebulae(3) and protostars(4,5) devoid of planetary bodies questions the relevance of this indicator; but in the absence of an alternative mode of formation under circumstellar conditions, this detection remains controversial(6-8). The main dust component observed in circumstellar envelopes is amorphous silicates(9), which are thought to have formed by non-equilibrium condensation(10). Here we report experiments demonstrating that carbonates can be formed with amorphous silicates during the non-equilibrium condensation of a silicate gas in a H2O-CO2-rich vapour.

Estimates of the relative and absolute ages of geological units on these objects have been based on this assumption(2). Here we present an analysis of the comparatively sparse crater population on Jupiter's icy moon Europa and suggest that this assumption is incorrect for small craters. We find that 'secondaries' (craters formed by material ejected from large primary impact craters) comprise about 95 per cent of the small craters (diameters less than 1 km) on Europa. We therefore conclude that large primary impacts into a solid surface (for example, ice or rock) produce far more secondaries than previously believed, implying that the small crater populations on the Moon, Mars and other large bodies must be dominated by secondaries.

Here we report the fabrication of semiconductor devices in which both the number and position of the dopant atoms are precisely controlled. To achieve this, we make use of a recently developed single-ion implantation technique(6-9), which enables us to implant dopant ions one-by-one into a fine semiconductor region until the desired number is reached. Electrical measurements of the resulting transistors reveal that device-to-device fluctuations in the threshold voltage (V-th; the turn-on voltage of the device) are less for those structures with ordered dopant arrays than for those with conventional random doping. We also find that the devices with ordered dopant arrays exhibit a shift in V-th, relative to the undoped semiconductor, that is twice that for a random dopant distribution (-0.4 V versus -0.2 V); we attribute this to the uniformity of electrostatic potential in the conducting channel region due to the ordered distribution of dopant atoms. Our results therefore serve to highlight the improvements in device performance that can be achieved through atomic-scale control of the doping process.

The introduction of catalytic systems using oxygen from air is preferred for 'green' processing(2). Gold catalysis is now showing potential in selective redox processes(3-6), particularly for alcohol oxidation(7-10) and the direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide(11,12). However, a major challenge that persists is the synthesis of an epoxide by the direct electrophilic addition of oxygen to an alkene(13). Although ethene is epoxidized efficiently using molecular oxygen with silver catalysts in a large-scale industrial process(14), this is unique because higher alkenes can only be effectively epoxidized using hydrogen peroxide(15-17), hydroperoxides(16) or stoichiometric oxygen donors. Here we show that nanocrystalline gold catalysts can provide tunable active catalysts for the oxidation of alkenes using air, with exceptionally high selectivity to partial oxidation products (similar to 98%) and significant conversions. Our finding significantly extends the discovery by Haruta(18,19) that nanocrystalline gold can epoxidize alkenes when hydrogen is used to activate the molecular oxygen; in our case, no sacrificial reductant is needed. We anticipate that our finding will initiate attempts to understand more fully the mechanism of oxygen activation at gold surfaces, which might lead to commercial exploitation of the high redox activity of gold nanocrystals.","Cardiff Univ, Sch Chem, Cardiff CF10 3AT, Wales; Johnson Matthey Catalysts, Middlesbrough TS23 1LB, England; Johnson Matthey Catalysts, Royston SG8 5HE, Herts, England; Lehigh Univ, Ctr Adv Mat & Nanotechnol, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA","Hutchings, GJ (reprint author), Cardiff Univ, Sch Chem, Main Bldg,Pk Pl, Cardiff CF10 3AT, Wales.",hutch@cardiff.ac.uk,"Kiely, Christopher/B-1959-2008; Carley, Albert/A-7372-2010; Xu, Yi-Jun/B-2566-2016","Xu, Yi-Jun/0000-0002-2195-1695",,,,24,708,724,31,430,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Oct,2005,437,7062,,,,,1132,1135,,10.1038/nature04190,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,975KD,WOS:000232660500039,16237439.0,No,,,11/20/17,cj,kiely,male,0.72,173,na,na

The Pacific anomaly, on the other hand, appears to be more rounded in shape(1-4,6,7,11). Mantle models with heterogeneous composition have related these structures to dense thermochemical piles or superplumes(12-19). It has not been shown, however, that such models can lead to thermochemical structures that satisfy the geometrical constraints, as inferred from seismological observations. Here we present numerical models of thermochemical convection in a three-dimensional spherical geometry using plate velocities inferred for the past 119 million years(20). We show that Earth's subduction history can lead to thermochemical structures similar in shape to the observed large, lower-mantle velocity anomalies.

Here we present experimental measurements of helium solubility in olivine at atmospheric pressure. Natural and synthetic olivines were equilibrated with a 50% helium atmosphere and analysed by crushing in vacuo followed by melting, and yield a minimum olivine-melt partition coefficient of 0.0025 +/- 0.0005 (s.d.) and a maximum of 0.0060 +/- 0.0007 (s.d.).

The plesiomorphic composition of the arthropod head remains enigmatic because variation in segments and corresponding appendages is extreme. Within extant arthropod classes (Chelicerata, Myriapoda, Crustacea and Hexapoda-including the insects), correspondences between the appendage-bearing second (deutocerebral) and third (tritocerebral) cephalic neuromeres have been recently resolved on the basis of immunohistochemistry(1) and Hox gene expression patterns(3,4). However, no appendage targets the first ganglion, the protocerebrum, and the corresponding segmental identity of this anterior region remains unclear(5). Reconstructions of stem-group arthropods indicate that the anteriormost region originally might have borne an ocular apparatus and a frontal appendage innervated by the protocerebrum(6). However, no study of the central nervous system in extant arthropods has been able to corroborate this idea directly, although recent analyses of cephalic gene expression patterns in insects suggest a segmental status for the protocerebral region(7-10). Here we investigate the developmental neuroanatomy of a putative basal arthropod(11), the pycnogonid sea spider, with immunohistochemical techniques. We show that the first pair of appendages, the chelifores, are innervated at an anterior position on the protocerebrum. This is the first true appendage shown to be innervated by the protocerebrum, and thus pycnogonid chelifores are not positionally homologous to appendages of extant arthropods but might, in fact, be homologous to the 'great appendages' of certain Cambrian stem-group arthropods.","Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Harvard Univ, Museum Comparat Zool, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Univ Hawaii, Pacific Biosci Res Ctr, Kewalo Marine Lab, Honolulu, HI 96813 USA","Maxmen, A (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, 26 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",amaxmen@oeb.harvard.edu,"Browne, William/D-4267-2013; Giribet, Gonzalo/P-1086-2015","Browne, William/0000-0001-8200-6489; Giribet, Gonzalo/0000-0002-5467-8429",,,,32,61,62,1,14,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Oct,2005,437,7062,,,,,1144,1148,,10.1038/nature03984,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,975KD,WOS:000232660500042,16237442.0,No,,,11/20/17,g,giribet,male,0.83,23,na,na

Here I show that several classes of non-coding DNA in Drosophila are evolving considerably slower than synonymous sites, and yet show an excess of between-species divergence relative to polymorphism when compared with synonymous sites. The former is a hallmark of selective constraint, but the latter is a signature of adaptive evolution, resembling general patterns of protein evolution in Drosophila(1,2). I estimate that about 40-70% of nucleotides in intergenic regions, untranslated portions of mature mRNAs ( UTRs) and most intronic DNA are evolutionarily constrained relative to synonymous sites. However, I also use an extension to the McDonald-Kreitman test(3) to show that a substantial fraction of the nucleotide divergence in these regions was driven to fixation by positive selection (about 20% for most intronic and intergenic DNA, and 60% for UTRs). On the basis of these observations, I suggest that a large fraction of the non-translated genome is functionally important and subject to both purifying selection and adaptive evolution. These results imply that, although positive selection is clearly an important facet of protein evolution, adaptive changes to non-coding DNA might have been considerably more common in the evolution of D. melanogaster.","Univ Calif San Diego, Div Biol Sci, Sect Ecol Behav & Evolut, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Andolfatto, P (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Div Biol Sci, Sect Ecol Behav & Evolut, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",pandolfatto@ucsd.edu,"Phelps, Steve/H-2263-2011",,,,,29,406,409,0,48,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Oct,2005,437,7062,,,,,1149,1152,,10.1038/nature04107,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,975KD,WOS:000232660500043,16237443.0,No,,,11/20/17,p,andolfatto,male,0.67,6,na,na

The extent to which weak negative and positive darwinian selection have driven the molecular evolution of different species varies greatly(5-16), with some species, such as Drosophila melanogaster, showing strong evidence of pervasive positive selection(6-9), and others, such as the selfing weed Arabidopsis thaliana, showing an excess of deleterious variation within local populations(9,10). Here we contrast patterns of coding sequence polymorphism identified by direct sequencing of 39 humans for over 11,000 genes to divergence between humans and chimpanzees, and find strong evidence that natural selection has shaped the recent molecular evolution of our species. Our analysis discovered 304 (9.0%) out of 3,377 potentially informative loci showing evidence of rapid amino acid evolution. Furthermore, 813 (13.5%) out of 6,033 potentially informative loci show a paucity of amino acid differences between humans and chimpanzees, indicating weak negative selection and/or balancing selection operating on mutations at these loci. We find that the distribution of negatively and positively selected genes varies greatly among biological processes and molecular functions, and that some classes, such as transcription factors, show an excess of rapidly evolving genes, whereas others, such as cytoskeletal proteins, show an excess of genes with extensive amino acid polymorphism within humans and yet little amino acid divergence between humans and chimpanzees.","Cornell Univ, Dept Biol Stat & Computat Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Bioinformat, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; Appl Biosyst Inc, Rockville, MD 20850 USA; Celera Diagnost, Alameda, CA 94502 USA; Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Genet, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; Cornell Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Bustamante, CD (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Dept Biol Stat & Computat Biol, 101 Biotechnol Bldg, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",cdb28@cornell.edu,"Nielsen, Rasmus/D-4405-2009","Nielsen, Rasmus/0000-0003-0513-6591","NHGRI NIH HHS [R01 HG003229, R01 HG003229-01]",,,24,516,524,3,106,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,20-Oct,2005,437,7062,,,,,1153,1157,,10.1038/nature04240,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,975KD,WOS:000232660500044,16237444.0,No,,,11/20/17,ag,clark,male,0.75,8,na,na

Yet regaining a habit can occur quickly, with even one or a few exposures to cues previously triggering the behaviour(1-3). To identify neural mechanisms that might underlie such learning dynamics, we made long-term recordings from multiple neurons in the sensorimotor striatum, a basal ganglia structure implicated in habit formation(4-8), in rats successively trained on a reward-based procedural task, given extinction training and then given reacquisition training. The spike activity of striatal output neurons, nodal points in cortico-basal ganglia circuits, changed markedly across multiple dimensions during each of these phases of learning. First, new patterns of task-related ensemble firing successively formed, reversed and then re-emerged. Second, task-irrelevant firing was suppressed, then rebounded, and then was suppressed again. These changing spike activity patterns were highly correlated with changes in behavioural performance. We propose that these changes in task representation in cortico-basal ganglia circuits represent neural equivalents of the explore-exploit behaviour characteristic of habit learning.","MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; MIT, McGovern Inst Brain Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Penn State Univ, Dept Phys, Davey Lab 0104, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Graybiel, AM (reprint author), MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, 43 Vassar St,46-6133, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",graybiel@mit.edu,,,NIMH NIH HHS [R01 MH060379]; NINDS NIH HHS [P50 NS038372],,,30,309,312,1,40,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Oct,2005,437,7062,,,,,1158,1161,,10.1038/nature04053,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,975KD,WOS:000232660500045,16237445.0,No,,,11/20/17,am,graybiel,male,0.75,12,na,na

The human influenza A virus continues to thrive even among populations with widespread access to vaccines, and continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality(1,2). The virus mutates from year to year, making the existing vaccines ineffective on a regular basis, and requiring that new strains be chosen for a new vaccine. Less-frequent major changes, known as antigenic shift, create new strains against which the human population has little protective immunity, thereby causing worldwide pandemics. The most recent pandemics include the 1918 'Spanish' flu, one of the most deadly outbreaks in recorded history, which killed 30-50 million people worldwide, the 1957 'Asian' flu, and the 1968 'Hong Kong' flu(3). Motivated by the need for a better understanding of influenza evolution, we have developed flexible protocols that make it possible to apply large-scale sequencing techniques to the highly variable influenza genome. Here we report the results of sequencing 209 complete genomes of the human influenza A virus, encompassing a total of 2,821,103 nucleotides. In addition to increasing markedly the number of publicly available, complete influenza virus genomes, we have discovered several anomalies in these first 209 genomes that demonstrate the dynamic nature of influenza transmission and evolution. This new, large-scale sequencing effort promises to provide a more comprehensive picture of the evolution of influenza viruses and of their pattern of transmission through human and animal populations.

One of these viral 'signatures', double-stranded (ds) RNA, is a replication product of most viruses within infected cells and is sensed by Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and the recently identified cytosolic RNA helicases RIG-I (retinoic acid inducible gene I, also known as Ddx58) and Mda5 (melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5, also known as Ifih1 or Helicard)(1). Both helicases detect dsRNA, and through their protein-interacting CARD domains, relay an undefined signal resulting in the activation of the transcription factors interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and NF-kappa B. Here we describe Cardif, a new CARD-containing adaptor protein that interacts with RIG-I and recruits IKK alpha, IKK beta and IKK epsilon kinases by means of its C-terminal region, leading to the activation of NF-kappa B and IRF3. Overexpression of Cardif results in interferon-beta and NF-kappa B promoter activation, and knockdown of Cardif by short interfering RNA inhibits RIG-I-dependent antiviral responses. Cardif is targeted and inactivated by NS3-4A, a serine protease from hepatitis C virus known to block interferon-beta production. Cardif thus functions as an adaptor, linking the cytoplasmic dsRNA receptor RIG-I to the initiation of antiviral programmes.","Univ Lausanne, Dept Biochem, BIL Biomed Res Ctr, CH-1066 Epalinges, Switzerland; Univ Geneva, Fac Med, Dept Microbiol & Mol Med, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; MEMOREC Biotec GmbH, D-50829 Cologne, Germany; CHU Vaudois, Div Gastroenterol & Hepatol, CH-1011 Lausanne, Switzerland; Univ Heidelberg, Dept Mol Virol, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany","Tschopp, R (reprint author), Univ Lausanne, Dept Biochem, BIL Biomed Res Ctr, Chemin Boveresses 155, CH-1066 Epalinges, Switzerland.",jurg.tschopp@unil.ch,"Binder, Marco/E-9717-2011; Bartenschlager, Ralf/L-2582-2015","Binder, Marco/0000-0002-5805-6109; Meylan, Etienne/0000-0002-0899-2230; Moradpour, Darius/0000-0003-1977-6792",,,,32,1419,1510,6,87,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Oct,2005,437,7062,,,,,1167,1172,,10.1038/nature04193,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,975KD,WOS:000232660500047,16177806.0,No,,,11/20/17,r,tschopp,male,0.79,42,na,na

This involves, in the short term, phosphorylation of photosystem II (PSII) and light-harvesting (LHCII) proteins. PSII phosphorylation is thought to be relevant for PSII turnover(1,2), whereas LHCII phosphorylation is associated with the relocation of LHCII and the redistribution of excitation energy (state transitions) between photosystems(3,4). In the long term, imbalances in energy distribution between photosystems are counteracted by adjusting photosystem stoichiometry(5,6). In the green alga Chlamydomonas and the plant Arabidopsis, state transitions require the orthologous protein kinases STT7 and STN7, respectively(7,8). Here we show that in Arabidopsis a second protein kinase, STN8, is required for the quantitative phosphorylation of PSII core proteins. However, PSII activity under high-intensity light is affected only slightly in stn8 mutants, and D1 turnover is indistinguishable from the wild type, implying that reversible protein phosphorylation is not essential for PSII repair. Acclimation to changes in light quality is defective in stn7 but not in stn8 mutants, indicating that short-term and long-term photosynthetic adaptations are coupled. Therefore the phosphorylation of LHCII, or of an unknown substrate of STN7, is also crucial for the control of photosynthetic gene expression.","Univ Munich, Dept Biol 1, Inst Bot, D-80638 Munich, Germany; Max Planck Inst Zuchtungsforsch, Abt Pflanzenzuchtung & Genet, D-50829 Cologne, Germany; Fdn Parco Tecnol Padano, I-26900 Lodi, Italy; Univ Jena, Lehrstuhl Pflanzenphysiol, D-07743 Jena, Germany; Univ Dusseldorf, Inst Biochem Pflanzen, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany","Leister, D (reprint author), Univ Munich, Dept Biol 1, Inst Bot, Menzinger Str 67, D-80638 Munich, Germany.",leister@lrz.uni-muenchen.de,"Schleiff, Enrico/C-5105-2017; Leister, Dario/D-5587-2009","Schleiff, Enrico/0000-0002-0518-3489; Leister, Dario/0000-0003-1897-8421; Pesaresi, Paolo/0000-0002-3236-7005",,,,30,267,284,1,49,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Oct,2005,437,7062,,,,,1179,1182,,10.1038/nature04016,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,975KD,WOS:000232660500049,16237446.0,No,,,11/20/17,d,leister,male,0.79,43,na,na

Z-DNA is also stabilized by specific protein binding; several proteins have been identified with low nanomolar binding constants(5-9). Z-DNA occurs in a dynamic state, forming as a result of physiological processes then relaxing to the right-handed B-DNA(1). Each time a DNA segment turns into Z-DNA, two B-Z junctions form. These have been examined extensively(10-12), but their structure was unknown. Here we describe the structure of a B-Z junction as revealed by X-ray crystallography at 2.6 angstrom resolution. A 15-base-pair segment of DNA is stabilized at one end in the Z conformation by Z-DNA binding proteins, while the other end remains B-DNA.

RNase E cleaves RNA internally, but its catalytic power is determined by the 50 terminus of the substrate, even if this lies at a distance from the cutting site(11-14). Here we report crystal structures of the catalytic domain of RNase E as trapped allosteric intermediates with RNA substrates. Four subunits of RNase E catalytic domain associate into an interwoven quaternary structure, explaining why the subunit organization is required for catalytic activity. The subdomain encompassing the active site is structurally congruent to a deoxyribonuclease, making an unexpected link in the evolutionary history of RNA and DNA nucleases. The structure explains how the recognition of the 50 terminus of the substrate may trigger catalysis and also sheds light on the question of how RNase E might selectively process, rather than destroy, specific RNA precursors.","Univ Cambridge, Dept Biochem, Cambridge CB2 1GA, England; Univ Leeds, Astbury Ctr Struct Mol Biol, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Chem & Biochem, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Sinsheimer Labs, Ctr Mol Biol RNA, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA","Luisi, BF (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Biochem, 80 Tennis Court Rd, Cambridge CB2 1GA, England.",ben@cryst.bioc.cam.ac.uk,"Marcaida, Maria Jose/I-1644-2017","Marcaida, Maria Jose/0000-0003-0663-5309",Wellcome Trust,,,30,155,158,3,21,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Oct,2005,437,7062,,,,,1187,1191,,10.1038/nature04084,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,975KD,WOS:000232660500051,16237448.0,No,,,11/20/17,bf,luisi,male,1,10,na,na

Recombinant plectasin was produced at a very high, and commercially viable, yield and purity.

Plectasin showed extremely low toxicity in mice, and cured them of experimental peritonitis and pneumonia caused by S. pneumoniae as efficaciously as vancomycin and penicillin.

Erosion and redeposition of putative circumpolar mud volcano deposits(15) ( formed by eruption of liquefied, fine-grained material) led to the formation of an Early Amazonian polar plateau consisting of dark layered materials. Crater ejecta superposed on pedestals indicate that a thin mantle was present during most of the Amazonian, suggesting generally higher obliquity and insolation conditions at the poles than at present. Brighter polar layered deposits rest unconformably on the dark layers and formed mainly during lower obliquity over the past 4 - 5Myr (ref. 20).

First suggested as a mechanism for the cyclic recurrence of ice ages, stochastic resonance has been seen in a wide variety of macroscopic physical systems: bistable ring lasers(3), superconducting quantum interference devices(4,5) (SQUIDs), magnetoelastic ribbons(6) and neurophysiological systems such as the receptors in crickets(7) and crayfish(8). Although fundamentally important as a mechanism of coherent signal amplification, stochastic resonance has yet to be observed in nanoscale systems. Here we report the observation of stochastic resonance in bistable nanomechanical silicon oscillators. Our nanomechanical systems consist of beams that are clamped at each end and driven into transverse oscillation with the use of a radiofrequency source. Modulation of the source induces controllable switching of the beams between two stable, distinct states. We observe that the addition of white noise causes a marked amplification of the signal strength.

Previously, the Drosophila melanogaster CG15920 gene was tentatively identified as one encoding a resilin-like protein(8,9) (pro-resilin). Here we report the cloning and expression of the first exon of the Drosophila CG15920 gene as a soluble protein in Escherichia coli. We show that this recombinant protein can be cast into a rubber-like biomaterial by rapid photochemical crosslinking. This observation validates the role of the putative elastic repeat motif in resilin function. The resilience ( recovery after deformation) of crosslinked recombinant resilin was found to exceed that of unfilled synthetic polybutadiene, a high resilience rubber. We believe that our work will greatly facilitate structural investigations into the functional properties of resilin and shed light on more general aspects of the structure of elastomeric proteins.

Long-term precipitation changes in the regions of northern and southern Africa influenced by the monsoons are thought to have been governed by precessional variations in summer insolation(1,2). Conversely, short-term precipitation changes in the northern African tropics have been linked to North Atlantic sea surface temperature anomalies, affecting the northward extension of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and its associated rainbelt(3,4). Our knowledge of large-scale hydrological changes in equatorial Africa and their forcing factors is, however, limited(5). Here we analyse the isotopic composition of terrigenous plant lipids, extracted from a marine sediment core close to the Congo River mouth, in order to reconstruct past central African rainfall variations and compare this record to sea surface temperature changes in the South Atlantic Ocean. We find that central African precipitation during the past 20,000 years was mainly controlled by the difference in sea surface temperatures between the tropics and subtropics of the South Atlantic Ocean, whereas we find no evidence that changes in the position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone had a significant influence on the overall moisture availability in central Africa.

These include armbones belonging to the holotype skeleton, a second adult mandible, and postcranial material from other individuals. We can now reconstruct the body proportions of H. floresiensis with some certainty. The finds further demonstrate that LB1 is not just an aberrant or pathological individual, but is representative of a long-term population that was present during the interval 95 - 74 to 12 thousand years ago. The excavation also yielded more evidence for the depositional history of the cave and for the behavioural capabilities of H. floresiensis, including the butchery of Stegodon and use of fire.","Univ New England, Sch Human & Environm Studies, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia; Indonesian Ctr Archaeol, Jakarta 12001, Indonesia; Univ Wollongong, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, GeoQuEST Res Ctr, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia","Morwood, MJ (reprint author), Univ New England, Sch Human & Environm Studies, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia.",mmorwood@pobox.une.edu.au; pbrown3@pobox.une.edu.au,"Roberts, Richard/B-8245-2013","Roberts, Richard/0000-0002-0128-4119; Westaway, Kira/0000-0001-5315-778X",,,,29,177,182,1,97,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Oct,2005,437,7061,,,,,1012,1017,,10.1038/nature04022,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,973AU,WOS:000232496100043,16229067.0,No,,,11/20/17,t,djubiantono,male,0.88,73,na,na

Here we show that mammalian Smoothened (Smo), a seven-transmembrane protein essential for Hh signalling(3), is expressed on the primary cilium. This ciliary expression is regulated by Hh pathway activity; Sonic hedgehog or activating mutations in Smo promote ciliary localization, whereas the Smo antagonist cyclopamine inhibits ciliary localization. The translocation of Smo to primary cilia depends upon a conserved hydrophobic and basic residue sequence homologous to a domain previously shown to be required for the ciliary localization of seven-transmembrane proteins in Caenorhabditis elegans(4). Mutation of this domain not only prevents ciliary localization but also eliminates Smo activity both in cultured cells and in zebrafish embryos. Thus, Hh-dependent translocation to cilia is essential for Smo activity, suggesting that Smo acts at the primary cilium.","Univ Calif San Francisco, Dev & Stem Cell Biol Program, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Ctr Diabet, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem & Biophys, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Reiter, JF (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dev & Stem Cell Biol Program, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",jreiter@diabetes.ucsf.edu,,"Aanstad, Pia/0000-0003-3893-2973; Stainier, Didier/0000-0002-0382-0026",,,,29,735,750,3,54,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Oct,2005,437,7061,,,,,1018,1021,,10.1038/nature04117,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,973AU,WOS:000232496100044,16136078.0,No,,,11/20/17,jf,reiter,male,0.94,16,na,na

Changes in synaptic plasticity in dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) may contribute to circuit modification induced by many drugs of abuse, including cocaine(6-13). Here we report that, following repeated exposure to cocaine in vivo, excitatory synapses to rat VTA dopamine neurons become highly susceptible to the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) by correlated pre- and postsynaptic activity. This facilitated LTP induction is caused by cocaine-induced reduction of GABA(A) (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptor- mediated inhibition of these dopamine neurons. In midbrain slices from rats treated with saline or a single dose of cocaine, LTP could not be induced in VTA dopamine neurons unless GABA-mediated inhibition was reduced by bicuculline or picrotoxin. However, LTP became readily inducible in slices from rats treated repeatedly with cocaine; this LTP induction was prevented by enhancing GABA-mediated inhibition using diazepam. Furthermore, repeated cocaine exposure reduced the amplitude of GABA-mediated synaptic currents and increased the probability of spike initiation in VTA dopamine neurons. This cocaine-induced enhancement of synaptic plasticity in the VTA may be important for the formation of drug-associated memory.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Helen Wills Neurosci Inst, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Div Neurobiol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Poo, MM (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Helen Wills Neurosci Inst, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Div Neurobiol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",qsliu@berkeley.edu; mpoo@berkeley.edu,"yu, yan/C-2322-2012",,"NINDS NIH HHS [R01 NS036999, R01 NS037831]",,,30,197,200,0,12,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Oct,2005,437,7061,,,,,1027,1031,,10.1038/nature04050,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,973AU,WOS:000232496100046,16222299.0,No,,,11/20/17,mm,poo,na,na,na,na,na

This approach was used to analyse changes in blood leukocyte gene expression patterns in human subjects receiving an inflammatory stimulus ( bacterial endotoxin). We explore the known genome-wide interaction network to identify significant functional modules perturbed in response to this stimulus. Our analysis reveals that the human blood leukocyte response to acute systemic inflammation includes the transient dysregulation of leukocyte bioenergetics and modulation of translational machinery.

It has been assumed that nondisjunction of a chromosome during mitosis will yield two aneuploid daughter cells. Here we show that chromosome nondisjunction is tightly coupled to regulation of cytokinesis in human cell lines, such that nondisjunction results in the formation of tetraploid rather than aneuploid cells. We observed that spontaneously arising binucleated cells exhibited chromosome mis-segregation rates up to 166-fold higher than the overall mitotic population. Long-term imaging experiments indicated that most binucleated cells arose through a bipolar mitosis followed by regression of the cleavage furrow hours later. Nondisjunction occurred with high frequency in cells that became binucleated by furrow regression, but not in cells that completed cytokinesis to form two mononucleated cells. Our findings indicate that nondisjunction does not directly yield aneuploid cells, but rather tetraploid cells that may subsequently become aneuploid through further division. The coupling of spontaneous segregation errors to furrow regression provides a potential explanation for the prevalence of hyperdiploid chromosome number and centrosome amplification observed in many cancers(8,9).","Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","King, RW (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, 240 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",randy_king@hms.harvard.edu,"Yang, Weimei/N-2928-2013; Shi, Qinghua/N-2950-2013","King, Randall/0000-0001-7882-8180",,,,30,260,268,0,17,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Oct,2005,437,7061,,,,,1038,1042,,10.1038/nature03958,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,973AU,WOS:000232496100048,16222248.0,No,,,11/20/17,rw,king,male,1,1,XiGtG-IAAAAJ,782

Here we test this idea by transiently blocking cytokinesis in p53-null (p53(-/-)) mouse mammary epithelial cells (MMECs), enabling the isolation of diploid and tetraploid cultures. The tetraploid cells had an increase in the frequency of whole-chromosome mis-segregation and chromosomal rearrangements. Only the tetraploid cells were transformed in vitro after exposure to a carcinogen. Furthermore, in the absence of carcinogen, only the tetraploid cells gave rise to malignant mammary epithelial cancers when transplanted subcutaneously into nude mice. These tumours all contained numerous non-reciprocal translocations and an 8-30-fold amplification of a chromosomal region containing a cluster of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) genes. MMP overexpression is linked to mammary tumours in humans and animal models(4).

This activity inhibits the anaphase-promoting complex/ cyclosome (APC/C), a ubiquitin ligase that triggers anaphase onset and mitotic/meiotic exit by targeting securin and M-phase cyclins for destruction(3,4,5). On fertilization a transient rise in free intracellular calcium(6) causes release from CSF arrest and thus APC/C activation. Although it has previously been shown that calcium induces the release of APC/C from CSF inhibition through calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II ( CaMKII)(7,8), the relevant substrates of this kinase have not been identified. Recently, we characterized XErp1 (Emi2), an inhibitor of the APC/C and key component of CSF activity in Xenopus egg extract(9). Here we show that calcium-activated CaMKII triggers exit from meiosis II by sensitizing the APC/C inhibitor XErp1 for polo-like kinase 1 (Plx1)-dependent degradation. Phosphorylation of XErp1 by CaMKII leads to the recruitment of Plx1 that in turn triggers the destruction of XErp1 by phosphorylating a site known to serve as a phosphorylation-dependent degradation signal. These results provide a molecular explanation for how the fertilization-induced calcium increase triggers exit from meiosis II.","Max Planck Inst Biochem, Independent Res Grp, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany; Max Planck Inst Biochem, Dept Cell Biol, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany","Mayer, TU (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Biochem, Independent Res Grp, Klopferspitz 18, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany.",mayer@biochem.mpg.de,,"nigg, erich/0000-0003-4835-5719",,,,22,155,162,1,10,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Oct,2005,437,7061,,,,,1048,1052,,10.1038/nature04093,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,973AU,WOS:000232496100050,16127448.0,No,,,11/20/17,tu,mayer,male,0.73,26,na,na

Questions such as whether there are genuine folding intermediates, and whether the events at the earliest stages are just rearrangements of the denatured state(1) or progress from populated transition states(2), remain unresolved. The problem is that there is a lack of experimental high-resolution structural information about early folding intermediates and denatured states under conditions that favour folding because competent states spontaneously fold rapidly. Here we have solved directly the solution structure of a true denatured state by nuclear magnetic resonance under conditions that would normally favour folding, and directly studied its equilibrium and kinetic behaviour. We engineered a mutant of Drosophila melanogaster Engrailed homeodomain that folds and unfolds reversibly just by changing ionic strength. At high ionic strength, the mutant L16A is an ultra-fast folding native protein, just like the wild-type protein; however, at physiological ionic strength it is denatured. The denatured state is a well-ordered folding intermediate, poised to fold by docking helices and breaking some non-native interactions. It unfolds relatively progressively with increasingly denaturing conditions, and so superficially resembles a denatured state with properties that vary with conditions. Such ill-defined unfolding is a common feature of early folding intermediate states and accounts for why there are so many controversies about intermediates versus compact denatured states in protein folding.","MRC Ctr, Ctr Prot Engn, Cambridge CB2 2QH, England; Univ Cambridge, MRC Ctr, Chem Labs, Cambridge CB2 2QH, England","Fersht, AR (reprint author), MRC Ctr, Ctr Prot Engn, Hills Rd, Cambridge CB2 2QH, England.",arf25@cam.ac.uk,,"Markson, Joseph/0000-0002-3167-3887; Mayor, Ugo/0000-0003-2812-8287",,,,24,183,186,1,8,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Oct,2005,437,7061,,,,,1053,1056,,10.1038/nature04054,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,973AU,WOS:000232496100051,16222301.0,No,,,11/20/17,ar,fersht,male,0.89,75,na,na

Numerous searches for the afterglows of short-hard bursts have been made, galvanized by the revolution in our understanding of long-duration GRBs that followed the discovery in 1997 of their broadband (X-ray, optical and radio) afterglow emission. Here we present the discovery of the X-ray afterglow of a short-hard burst, GRB 050709, whose accurate position allows us to associate it unambiguously with a star-forming galaxy at redshift z = 0.160, and whose optical lightcurve definitively excludes a supernova association. Together with results from three other recent short-hard bursts, this suggests that short-hard bursts release much less energy than the long-duration GRBs. Models requiring young stellar populations, such as magnetars and collapsars, are ruled out, while coalescing degenerate binaries remain the most promising progenitor candidates.","Natl Radio Astron Observ, Socorro, NM 87801 USA; CALTECH, Div Phys Math & Astron, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; Penn State Univ, Dept Astron & Astrophys, Davey Lab 525, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; Univ Hawaii, Inst Astron, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; Carnegie Observ, Pasadena, CA 91101 USA; Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Racah Inst Phys, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel; Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Astron & Astrophys, Weston, ACT 2611, Australia; Pomona Coll, Claremont, CA 91711 USA; Univ Virginia, Dept Astron, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; Univ Texas, Dept Astron, Austin, TX 78731 USA; Gemini Observ, Hilo, HI 96720 USA; Univ Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Inst, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; Univ Toronto, Dept Astron & Astrophys, Toronto, ON M5S 3H8, Canada; Tokyo Inst Technol, Dept Phys, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1528551, Japan; Natl Astron Observ Japan, Subaru Telescope, Hilo, HI 96720 USA; Kyoto Univ, Sch Sci, Dept Astron, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Livermore, CA 94550 USA; Inst Adv Study, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Space Sci Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Frail, DA (reprint author), Natl Radio Astron Observ, POB O, Socorro, NM 87801 USA.",dfox@astro.psu.edu; dfrail@nrao.edu,"Watson, Darach/E-4521-2015","Watson, Darach/0000-0002-4465-8264; MacFadyen, Andrew/0000-0002-0106-9013",,,,43,370,377,4,16,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Oct,2005,437,7060,,,,,845,850,,10.1038/nature04189,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,970VB,WOS:000232338600037,16208362.0,No,,,11/20/17,kc,hurley,female,0.63,123,na,na

X-ray localizations have recently become available(8,9) for short ( duration < 2 s) GRBs, which have evaded optical detection for more than 30 years.

The optical afterglow was localized with subarcsecond accuracy, and lies in the outskirts of a blue dwarf galaxy. The optical and X-ray(10) afterglow properties 34 h after the GRB are reminiscent of the afterglows of long GRBs, which are attributable to synchrotron emission from ultrarelativistic ejecta.

In contrast, eukaryotic cells use flagella that resemble elastic rods(4) and exhibit a beating motion: internally generated stresses give rise to a series of bends that propagate towards the tip(5-7). In contrast to this variety of swimming strategies encountered in nature, a controlled swimming motion of artificial micrometre-sized structures has not yet been realized. Here we show that a linear chain of colloidal magnetic particles linked by DNA and attached to a red blood cell can act as a flexible artificial flagellum. The filament aligns with an external uniformmagnetic field and is readily actuated by oscillating a transverse field.

It marks the end of a 2.5-Gyr period dominated by anoxic and iron-rich deep oceans. However, despite rising oxygen levels and a concomitant increase in marine sulphate concentration, related to enhanced sulphide oxidation during continental weathering(4), the chemistry of the oceans in the following mid-Proterozoic interval (similar to 1.8 - 0.8 Gyr ago) probably did not yet resemble our oxygen-rich modern oceans. Recent data(5-8) indicate that marine oxygen and sulphate concentrations may have remained well below current levels during this period, with one model indicating that anoxic and sulphidic marine basins were widespread, and perhaps even globally distributed(4). Here we present hydrocarbon biomarkers ( molecular fossils) from a 1.64-Gyr-old basin in northern Australia, revealing the ecological structure of mid-Proterozoic marine communities. The biomarkers signify a marine basin with anoxic, sulphidic, sulphate-poor and permanently stratified deep waters, hostile to eukaryotic algae. Phototrophic purple sulphur bacteria ( Chromatiaceae) were detected in the geological record based on the new carotenoid biomarker okenane, and they seem to have co-existed with communities of green sulphur bacteria ( Chlorobiaceae). Collectively, the biomarkers support mounting evidence for a long-lasting Proterozoic world in which oxygen levels remained well below modern levels.","Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Macquarie Univ, Australian Ctr Astrobiol, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Geosci Australia, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; Univ Aberdeen, Dept Geol & Petr Geol, Aberdeen AB24 3UE, Scotland","Brocks, JJ (reprint author), Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",jochen.brocks@anu.edu.au,"Brocks, Jochen/E-3920-2012","Brocks, Jochen/0000-0002-8430-8744",,,,30,257,281,4,86,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Oct,2005,437,7060,,,,,866,870,,10.1038/nature04068,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,970VB,WOS:000232338600042,16208367.0,No,,,11/20/17,sa,bowden,female,0.63,130,na,na

Since this observation, other large earthquakes have been shown to induce dynamic triggering at remote distances - for example, after the 1999 magnitude 7.1 Hector Mine(1) and the 2002 magnitude 7.9 Denali(4) earthquakes - and in the near-field as aftershocks(5). The physical origin of dynamic triggering, however, remains one of the least understood aspects of earthquake nucleation(1-5). The dynamic strain amplitudes from a large earthquake are exceedingly small once the waves have propagated more than several fault radii. For example, a strain wave amplitude of 10(-6) and wavelength 1 m corresponds to a displacement amplitude of about 10(-7) m. Here we show that the dynamic, elastic-nonlinear behaviour of fault gouge perturbed by a seismic wave may trigger earthquakes, even with such small strains. We base our hypothesis on recent laboratory dynamic experiments conducted in granular media, a fault gouge surrogate(6,7). From these we infer that, if the fault is weak(8-10), seismic waves cause the fault core modulus to decrease abruptly and weaken further. If the fault is already near failure, this process could therefore induce fault slip.","Los Alamos Natl Lab, Geophys Grp EES11, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA; Univ Marne la Vallee, CNRS, UMR 8108, Lab Phys Mat Divises & Interfaces, F-77454 Marne La Vallee, France","Johnson, PA (reprint author), Los Alamos Natl Lab, Geophys Grp EES11, MS D443, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA.",paj@lanl.gov,,,,,,28,163,168,8,41,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Oct,2005,437,7060,,,,,871,874,,10.1038/nature04015,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,970VB,WOS:000232338600043,16208368.0,No,,,11/20/17,x,jia,na,na,na,na,na

Here we report two new pterosaurs that are referred to European groups previously unknown in deposits of northeastern China. Feilongus youngi, from the Yixian Formation(1,3), is closely related to the Gallodactylidae(5-6) and is distinguished by the presence of two independent sagittal crests and a protruding upper jaw. Nurhachius ignaciobritoi, from the Jiufotang Formation(2,3), has teeth formed by labiolingually compressed triangular crowns, only previously reported in Istiodactylus latidens(7) from England. With these new discoveries, the Jehol pterosaurs show a wide range of groups including both primitive and derived forms that are not matched by any other deposit in the world. The discoveries also document the turnover of pterosaur faunae, with the primitive Anurognathidae and early archaeopterodactyloids being replaced by derived pterodactyloids. Furthermore, these deposits offer an opportunity to examine the interaction and competition between birds and pterosaurs - it indicates that the avian fauna during the Lower Cretaceous ( and possibly most of the Mesozoic) dominated terrestrial, inland regions, whereas pterosaurs were more abundant in coastal areas.","Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Paleontol & Paleoanthropol, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Museu Nacl, Dept Geol & Paleontol, Paleovertebrate Sector, BR-20940040 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; Museu Ciencias Terra, Dept Nacl Prod Mineral, BR-22290240 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil","Wang, XL (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Paleontol & Paleoanthropol, POB 643, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China.",xlinwang@263.net; kellner@acd.ufrj.br,"Kellner, Alexander/H-1023-2015","Kellner, Alexander/0000-0001-7174-9447",,,,30,96,114,1,15,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Oct,2005,437,7060,,,,,875,879,,10.1038/nature03982,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,970VB,WOS:000232338600044,16208369.0,No,,,11/20/17,dd,campos,female,0.67,3,na,na

In addition, ecologists increasingly recognize that fluxes of organisms across ecosystem boundaries can have major consequences for community dynamics(5,6). Species with complex life histories often shift habitats during their life cycles(7) and provide potent conduits coupling ecosystems(5,6). Thus, local interactions that affect predator abundance in one ecosystem ( for example a larval habitat) may have reverberating effects in another ( for example an adult habitat). Here we show that fish indirectly facilitate terrestrial plant reproduction through cascading trophic interactions across ecosystem boundaries. Fish reduce larval dragonfly abundances in ponds, leading to fewer adult dragonflies nearby. Adult dragonflies consume insect pollinators and alter their foraging behaviour. As a result, plants near ponds with fish receive more pollinator visits and are less pollen limited than plants near fish-free ponds. Our results confirm that strong species interactions can reverberate across ecosystems, and emphasize the importance of landscape-level processes in driving local species interactions.","Univ Florida, Dept Zool, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; Washington Univ, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA","Knight, TM (reprint author), Univ Florida, Dept Zool, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",tknight@biology2.wustl.edu,,,,,,28,234,245,10,283,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Oct,2005,437,7060,,,,,880,883,,10.1038/nature03962,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,970VB,WOS:000232338600045,16208370.0,No,,,11/20/17,rd,holt,male,0.89,9,na,na

This plant disease is typically initiated by an abnormal swelling of the seedling roots without any sign of infection by the pathogen(1-4). This characteristic symptom is in fact caused by the macrocyclic polyketide metabolite rhizoxin that has been isolated from cultures of Rhizopus sp.(5,6). The phytotoxin exerts its destructive effect by binding to rice beta-tubulin, which results in inhibition of mitosis and cell cycle arrest(7,8). Owing to its remarkably strong antimitotic activity in most eukaryotic cells, including various human cancer cell lines, rhizoxin has attracted considerable interest as a potential antitumour drug(9,10). Here we show that rhizoxin is not biosynthesized by the fungus itself, but by endosymbiotic, that is, intracellular living, bacteria of the genus Burkholderia. Our unexpected findings unveil a remarkably complex symbiotic-pathogenic relationship that extends the fungus - plant interaction to a third, bacterial, key-player, and opens new perspectives for pest control.","HKI, Leibniz Inst Nat Prod Res & Infect Biol, D-07745 Jena, Germany","Hertweck, C (reprint author), HKI, Leibniz Inst Nat Prod Res & Infect Biol, Beutenbergstr 11a, D-07745 Jena, Germany.",Christian.Hertweck@hki-jena.de,"Partida-Martinez, Laila/A-5935-2009; Hertweck, Christian/G-1896-2014","Partida-Martinez, Laila/0000-0001-8037-2856; Hertweck, Christian/0000-0002-0367-337X",,,,28,270,281,8,88,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Oct,2005,437,7060,,,,,884,888,,10.1038/nature03997,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,970VB,WOS:000232338600046,16208371.0,No,,,11/20/17,c,hertweck,male,0.74,27,na,na

The polymerase protein sequences from the 1918 human influenza virus differ from avian consensus sequences at only a small number of amino acids, consistent with the hypothesis that they were derived from an avian source shortly before the pandemic. However, when compared to avian sequences, the nucleotide sequences of the 1918 polymerase genes have more synonymous differences than expected, suggesting evolutionary distance from known avian strains. Here we present sequence and phylogenetic analyses of the complete genome of the 1918 influenza virus(4-8), and propose that the 1918 virus was not a reassortant virus ( like those of the 1957 and 1968 pandemics(9,10)), but more likely an entirely avian-like virus that adapted to humans. These data support prior phylogenetic studies suggesting that the 1918 virus was derived from an avian source(11). A total of ten amino acid changes in the polymerase proteins consistently differentiate the 1918 and subsequent human influenza virus sequences from avian virus sequences. Notably, a number of the same changes have been found in recently circulating, highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses that have caused illness and death in humans and are feared to be the precursors of a new influenza pandemic. The sequence changes identified here may be important in the adaptation of influenza viruses to humans.","Armed Forces Inst Pathol, Dept Mol Pathol, Rockville, MD 20850 USA","Taubenberger, JK (reprint author), Armed Forces Inst Pathol, Dept Mol Pathol, Rockville, MD 20850 USA.",taubenberger@afip.osd.mil,,,,,,30,557,622,4,75,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Oct,2005,437,7060,,,,,889,893,,10.1038/nature04230,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,970VB,WOS:000232338600047,16208372.0,No,,,11/20/17,tg,fanning,female,0.67,3,na,na

We show that initially, only a small population of cells ( including both quiescent neural stem cells and transit-amplifying cells) responds to Shh in regions undergoing neurogenesis. This population subsequently expands markedly to continuously provide new neurons in the forebrain. Our study of the behaviour of quiescent neural stem cells provides in vivo evidence that they can self-renew for over a year and generate multiple cell types.

The vomeronasal organ, located at the base of the nasal septum, is responsible for mediating pheromone information in mice(3-9). Two classes of putative pheromone receptor gene families, V1R and V2R, are expressed by vomeronasal sensory neurons in mutually segregated epithelial zones of the vomeronasal organ(10-14). Although numerous studies have suggested that pheromones originate from urine(15-18), direct recordings of behaving mice have shown that neuronal firing in the vomeronasal system is modulated by physical contact with the facial area(19). Here we identify a male-specific 7-kDa peptide secreted from the extraorbital lacrimal gland. This peptide, which we named exocrine gland-secreting peptide 1 (ESP1), is encoded by a gene from a previously unrecognized large family clustered in proximity to the class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region. ESP1 is secreted from the eyes and is transferred to the female vomeronasal organ, where it stimulates V2R-expressing vomeronasal sensory neurons and elicits an electrical response. Our results indicate that mice respond to sex-specific peptides released from exocrine glands through the vomeronasal system during direct contact.","Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Dept Integrated Biosci, Chiba 2778562, Japan","Touhara, K (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Dept Integrated Biosci, Chiba 2778562, Japan.",touhara@k.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,,,,,29,216,226,0,22,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Oct,2005,437,7060,,,,,898,901,,10.1038/nature04033,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,970VB,WOS:000232338600049,16208374.0,No,,,11/20/17,k,touhara,male,0.63,49,na,na

The molecular identity and the gating mechanism of SOC and CRAC channels have remained elusive. Previously we identified Stim and the mammalian homologue STIM1 as essential components of CRAC channel activation in Drosophila S2 cells and human T lymphocytes(11). Here we show that the expression of EF-hand mutants of Stim or STIM1 activates CRAC channels constitutively without changing Ca2+ store content. By immunofluorescence, EM localization and surface biotinylation we show that STIM1 migrates from endoplasmic-reticulum-like sites to the plasma membrane upon depletion of the Ca2+ store.

In contrast to the MHC system, CD1 molecules bind lipid antigens that are presented at the antigen-presenting cell (APC) surface to lipid antigen-reactive T cells(1). Because CD1 molecules survey endocytic compartments(2), it is self-evident that they encounter antigens from extracellular sources. However, the mechanisms of exogenous lipid antigen delivery to CD1-antigen-loading compartments are not known. Serum apolipoproteins are mediators of extracellular lipid transport for metabolic needs(3). Here we define the pathways mediating markedly efficient exogenous lipid antigen delivery by apolipoproteins to achieve T-cell activation. Apolipoprotein E binds lipid antigens and delivers them by receptor-mediated uptake into endosomal compartments containing CD1 in APCs. Apolipoprotein E mediates the presentation of serum-borne lipid antigens and can be secreted by APCs as a mechanism to survey the local environment to capture antigens or to transfer microbial lipids from infected cells to bystander APCs. Thus, the immune system has co-opted a component of lipid metabolism to develop immunological responses to lipid antigens.","Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Rheumatol Allergy & Immunol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Ctr Neurol Dis, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Nutr, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Univ Birmingham, Sch Biosci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England","Brenner, MB (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",mbrenner@rics.bwh.harvard.edu,,"Besra, Gurdyal/0000-0002-5605-0395",NHLBI NIH HHS [R01 HL071590]; NIGMS NIH HHS [T32 GM007753]; Wellcome Trust,,,29,223,226,2,17,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Oct,2005,437,7060,,,,,906,910,,10.1038/nature04001,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,970VB,WOS:000232338600051,16208376.0,No,,,11/20/17,mb,brenner,female,0.71,7,na,na

Experimental evidence suggests that if these trends continue, key marine organisms - such as corals and some plankton - will have difficulty maintaining their external calcium carbonate skeletons. Here we use 13 models of the ocean - carbon cycle to assess calcium carbonate saturation under the IS92a 'business-as-usual' scenario for future emissions of anthropogenic carbon dioxide. In our projections, Southern Ocean surface waters will begin to become undersaturated with respect to aragonite, a metastable form of calcium carbonate, by the year 2050.

The supply of nutrients to the sunlit surface layer of the ocean has traditionally been attributed solely to vertical processes. However, horizontal advection may also be important in establishing the availability of nutrients. Here we show that the production and advection of North Atlantic Subtropical Mode Water introduces spatial and temporal variability in the subsurface nutrient reservoir beneath the North Atlantic subtropical gyre. As the mode water is formed, its nutrients are depleted by biological utilization. When the depleted water mass is exported to the gyre, it injects a wedge of low-nutrient water into the upper layers of the ocean. Contrary to intuition, cold winters that promote deep convective mixing and vigorous mode water formation may diminish downstream primary productivity by altering the subsurface delivery of nutrients.","Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Div Earth & Ocean Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA; Duke Univ, Marine Lab, Nicholas Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Div Coastal Syst Sci & Policy, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA","Palter, JB (reprint author), Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Div Earth & Ocean Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",jbp3@duke.edu,"Palter, Jaime/B-9484-2011",,,,,32,97,97,1,23,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,29-Sep,2005,437,7059,,,,,687,692,,10.1038/nature03969,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,968JD,WOS:000232157900043,16193044.0,No,,,11/20/17,rt,barber,male,0.83,6,na,na

It has been postulated that plants have both membrane-bound and soluble GA receptors; however, no GA receptors have yet been identified. Here we report the isolation and characterization of a new GA-insensitive dwarf mutant of rice, gid1. The GID1 gene encodes an unknown protein with similarity to the hormone-sensitive lipases, and we observed preferential localization of a GID1 - green fluorescent protein (GFP) signal in nuclei. Recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST) - GID1 had a high affinity only for biologically active GAs, whereas mutated GST - GID1 corresponding to three gid1 alleles had no GA-binding affinity. The dissociation constant for GA(4) was estimated to be around 10(-7) M, enough to account for the GA dependency of shoot elongation. Moreover, GID1 bound to SLR1, a rice DELLA protein, in a GA-dependent manner in yeast cells. GID1 overexpression resulted in a GA-hypersensitive phenotype. Together, our results indicate that GID1 is a soluble receptor mediating GA signalling in rice.","Nagoya Univ, Biosci & Biotechnol Ctr, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; Univ Tokyo, Dept Appl Biol Chem, Tokyo 1138657, Japan; Natl Inst Agrobiol Sci, Dept Biochem, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058602, Japan; RIKEN, Bioresources Ctr, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050074, Japan; Acad Sinica, Inst Bot, Taipei 11529, Taiwan; Univ Tokyo, Biotechnol Res Ctr, Tokyo 1138657, Japan","Matsuoka, M (reprint author), Nagoya Univ, Biosci & Biotechnol Ctr, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.",makoto@nuagr1.agr.nagoya-u.ac.jp,"Kobayashi, Masatomo/A-5945-2016",,,,,31,547,650,12,159,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,29-Sep,2005,437,7059,,,,,693,698,,10.1038/nature04028,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,968JD,WOS:000232157900044,16193045.0,No,,,11/20/17,m,matsuoka,male,0.74,158,na,na

We dissected and measured sources of variation in system output, analysing thousands of individual, genetically identical cells. Only a small proportion of total cell-to-cell variation is caused by random fluctuations in gene transcription and translation during the response ('expression noise'). Instead, variation is dominated by differences in the capacity of individual cells to transmit signals through the pathway ('pathway capacity') and to express proteins from genes ('expression capacity'). Cells with high expression capacity express proteins at a higher rate and increase in volume more rapidly. Our results identify two mechanisms that regulate cell-to-cell variation in pathway capacity. First, the MAP kinase Fus3 suppresses variation at high pheromone levels, while the MAP kinase Kss1 enhances variation at low pheromone levels. Second, pathway capacity and expression capacity are negatively correlated, suggesting a compensatory mechanism that allows cells to respond more precisely to pheromone in the presence of a large variation in expression capacity.","Inst Mol Sci, Berkeley, CA 94704 USA; MIT, Div Biol Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Gordon, A (reprint author), Inst Mol Sci, 2168 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA 94704 USA.",gordon@molsci.org; brent@molsci.org,"Serra, Eduard/K-1332-2013","Serra, Eduard/0000-0003-2895-9857; Endy, Drew/0000-0001-6952-8098; Colman-Lerner, Alejandro A/0000-0002-2557-8883",,,,38,261,266,1,20,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,29-Sep,2005,437,7059,,,,,699,706,,10.1038/nature03998,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,968JD,WOS:000232157900045,16170311.0,No,,,11/20/17,r,brent,male,0.79,42,na,na

In particular, all galaxies are believed to be embedded in massive haloes of dark matter(1,2). This view has recently been challenged by the observation of surprisingly low random stellar velocities in the outskirts of ordinary elliptical galaxies, which has been interpreted as indicating a lack of dark matter(3,4). Here we show that the low velocities are in fact compatible with galaxy formation in dark-matter haloes. Using numerical simulations of disk-galaxy mergers(5,6), we find that the stellar orbits in the outer regions of the resulting ellipticals are very elongated. These stars were torn by tidal forces from their original galaxies during the first close passage and put on outgoing trajectories. The elongated orbits, combined with the steeply falling density profile of the observed tracers, explain the observed low velocities even in the presence of large amounts of dark matter. Projection effects when viewing a triaxial elliptical can lead to even lower observed velocities along certain lines of sight.","Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Racah Inst Phys, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel; Inst Astrophys, F-75014 Paris, France; Observ Paris, F-92195 Meudon, France; Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Univ Calif Observ, Lick Observ, Dept Phys, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; Harvard Univ, Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Dekel, A (reprint author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Racah Inst Phys, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel.",dekel@phys.huji.ac.il,,"Mamon, Gary/0000-0001-8956-5953",,,,30,138,139,0,4,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,29-Sep,2005,437,7059,,,,,707,710,,10.1038/nature03970,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,968JD,WOS:000232157900046,16193046.0,No,,,11/20/17,jr,primack,male,0.98,103,na,na

Hence, the molecular photoemission can be regarded as a natural double-slit experiment(1): coherent electron emission originates from two identical sites, and should give rise to characteristic interference patterns(2). However, the quantum coherence is obscured if the two possible symmetry states of the electronic wavefunction ('gerade' and 'ungerade') are degenerate; the sum of the two exactly resembles the distinguishable, incoherent emission from two localized core sites. Here we observe the coherence of core electrons in N-2 through a direct measurement of the interference exhibited in their emission.

Because of the long timescale involved, however, the underlying dynamic processes responsible for the evolution of dune fields remain poorly understood(8). Here we combine data from a three-year field study in the Moroccan Sahara with a model study to show that barchans are fundamentally unstable and do not necessarily behave like stable solitary waves, as suggested previously(9-12). We find that dune collisions and changes in wind direction destabilize the dunes and generate surface waves on the barchans. Because the resulting surface waves propagate at a higher speed than the dunes themselves, they can produce a series of new barchans of elementary size by breaking the horns of large dunes. The creation of these new dunes provides a mechanism for sand loss that prevents dune fields from merging into a single giant dune and therefore plays a fundamental role in the control of size selection and the development of dune patterns.","Phys & Mecan Milieux Heterogenes Lab, CNRS, UMR 7636, F-75005 Paris, France; Univ Ibn Zohr, Dept Geol, Agadir 80000, Morocco","Andreotti, B (reprint author), Phys & Mecan Milieux Heterogenes Lab, CNRS, UMR 7636, 10 Rue Vauquelin, F-75005 Paris, France.",andreotti@pmmh.espci.fr,,,,,,18,102,113,2,22,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,29-Sep,2005,437,7059,,,,,720,723,,10.1038/nature04058,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,968JD,WOS:000232157900049,16193049.0,No,,,11/20/17,b,andreotti,male,0.65,40,na,na

Here we report direct LA-ICPMS measurements of the composition of fluids and melts equilibrated with a basaltic eclogite at pressures equivalent to depths in the Earth of 120 - 180 km and temperatures of 700 - 1,200 degrees C. The resultant liquid/mineral partition coefficients constrain the recycling rates of key elements. The dichotomy of dehydration versus melting at 120 km depth is expressed through contrasting behaviour of many trace elements (U/Th, Sr, Ba, Be and the light rare-earth elements). At pressures equivalent to 180 km depth, however, a supercritical liquid with melt-like solubilities for the investigated trace elements is observed, even at low temperatures. This mobilizes most of the key trace elements ( except the heavy rare-earth elements, Y and Sc) and thus limits fluid-phase transfer of geochemical signatures in subduction zones to pressures less than 6 GPa.","Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Inst Earth Sci, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel; ETH Zentrum, Inst Mineral & Petrog, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland","Kessel, R (reprint author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Inst Earth Sci, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel.",kessel@vms.huji.ac.il,"Schmidt, Max/A-1676-2008; Kessel, Ronit/A-3885-2017",,,,,32,544,570,13,139,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,29-Sep,2005,437,7059,,,,,724,727,,10.1038/nature03971,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,968JD,WOS:000232157900050,16193050.0,No,,,11/20/17,t,pettke,male,0.88,73,na,na

Diatom growth depends on silicate availability, in addition to nitrate and phosphate(2,3), but northern Atlantic waters are richer in nitrate than silicate(4). Following the spring stratification, diatoms are the first phytoplankton to bloom(2,5). Once silicate is exhausted, diatom blooms subside in a major export event(6,7). Here we show that, with nitrate still available for new production, the diatom bloom is prolonged where there is a periodic supply of new silicate: specifically, diatoms thrive by 'mining' deep-water silicate brought to the surface by an unstable ocean front.

The ability to climb menisci is a skill exploited by water-walking insects as they seek land in order to lay eggs or avoid predators(4); moreover, it was a necessary adaptation for their ancestors as they evolved from terrestrials to live exclusively on the water surface(3). Many millimetre-scale water-walking insects are unable to climb menisci using their traditional means of propulsion(2,3,9). Through a combined experimental and theoretical study, here we investigate the meniscus-climbing technique that such insects use.

Here we show that experimentally introduced technologies will spread within different ape communities. Unobserved by group mates, we first trained a high-ranking female from each of two groups of captive chimpanzees to adopt one of two different tool-use techniques for obtaining food from the same 'Pan-pipe' apparatus, then re-introduced each female to her respective group. All but two of 32 chimpanzees mastered the new technique under the influence of their local expert, whereas none did so in a third population lacking an expert. Most chimpanzees adopted the method seeded in their group, and these traditions continued to diverge over time.

How the endogenous brassinosteroids change in response to environmental stimuli is largely unknown. Ca2+/calmodulin has an essential role in sensing and transducing environmental stimuli(4,5). Arabidopsis DWARF1 (DWF1) is responsible for an early step in brassinosteroid biosynthesis that converts 24-methylenecholesterol to campesterol(6,7). Here we show that DWF1 is a Ca2+/calmodulin-binding protein and this binding is critical for its function. Molecular genetic analysis using site-directed and deletion mutants revealed that loss of calmodulin binding completely abolished the function of DWF1 in planta, whereas partial loss of calmodulin binding resulted in a partial dwarf phenotype in complementation studies. These results provide direct proof that Ca2+/calmodulin-mediated signalling has a critical role in controlling the function of DWF1. Furthermore, we observed that DWF1 orthologues from other plants have a similar Ca2+/calmodulin-binding domain, implying that Ca2+/calmodulin regulation of DWF1 and its homologues is common in plants. These results raise the possibility of producing size-engineered crops by altering the Ca2+/calmodulin-binding property of their DWF1 orthologues.","Washington State Univ, Ctr Integrated Biotechnol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; Washington State Univ, Dept Hort, Pullman, WA 99164 USA","Poovaiah, BW (reprint author), Washington State Univ, Ctr Integrated Biotechnol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",poovaiah@wsu.edu,,,,,,29,78,92,3,21,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,29-Sep,2005,437,7059,,,,,741,745,,10.1038/nature03973,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,968JD,WOS:000232157900054,16193053.0,No,,,11/20/17,bw,poovaiah,male,1,2,na,na

Studies in Drosophila melanogaster have proved fruitful in determining the signals used to control NF-kappa B proteins, beginning with the discovery that the Toll/NF-kappa B pathway, in addition to patterning the dorsal - ventral axis of the fly embryo, defines a major component of the innate immune response in both Drosophila and mammals(2,3). Here, we characterize the Drosophila wntD (Wnt inhibitor of Dorsal) gene. We show that WntD acts as a feedback inhibitor of the NF-kappa B homologue Dorsal during both embryonic patterning and the innate immune response to infection. wntD expression is under the control of Toll/Dorsal signalling, and increased levels of WntD block Dorsal nuclear accumulation, even in the absence of the I kappa B homologue Cactus. The WntD signal is independent of the common Wnt signalling component Armadillo (beta-catenin). By engineering a gene knockout, we show that wntD loss-of-function mutants have immune defects and exhibit increased levels of Toll/Dorsal signalling. Furthermore, the wntD mutant phenotype is suppressed by loss of zygotic dorsal. These results describe the first secreted feedback antagonist of Toll signalling, and demonstrate a novel Wnt activity in the fly.","Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Beckman Ctr, Howard Hughes Med Inst,Dept Dev Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Nusse, R (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Beckman Ctr, Howard Hughes Med Inst,Dept Dev Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",rnusse@stanford.edu,"Gordon, Michael/H-9586-2012; Dionne, Marc/J-2572-2013","Gordon, Michael/0000-0002-5440-986X; Dionne, Marc/0000-0002-8283-1750",NIAID NIH HHS [R01 AI053080],,,30,96,103,0,13,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,29-Sep,2005,437,7059,,,,,746,749,,10.1038/nature04073,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,968JD,WOS:000232157900055,16107793.0,No,,,11/20/17,r,nusse,male,0.79,42,na,na

Most quorum-sensing autoinducers promote intraspecies communication, but one autoinducer, called AI-2, is produced and detected by a wide variety of bacteria and is proposed to allow interspecies communication(1,2). Here we show that some species of bacteria can manipulate AI-2 signalling and interfere with other species' ability to assess and respond correctly to changes in cell population density. AI-2 signalling, and the interference with it, could have important ramifications for eukaryotes in the maintenance of normal microflora and in protection from pathogenic bacteria.","Princeton Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Bassler, BL (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",bbassler@molbio.princeton.edu,"Xavier, Karina/B-9425-2008","Xavier, Karina/0000-0001-5210-1434",NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM065859],,,19,153,164,0,47,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,29-Sep,2005,437,7059,,,,,750,753,,10.1038/nature03960,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,968JD,WOS:000232157900056,16193054.0,No,,,11/20/17,bl,bassler,male,1,3,na,na

Here we show that the nuclei are engulfed by macrophages only after they are disconnected from reticulocytes, and that phosphatidylserine, which is often used as an 'eat me' signal for apoptotic cells, is also used for the engulfment of nuclei expelled from erythroblasts. We investigated the mechanism behind the enucleation and engulfment processes by isolating late-stage erythroblasts from the spleens of phlebotomized mice. When these erythroblasts were cultured, the nuclei protruded spontaneously from the erythroblasts. A weak physical force could disconnect the nuclei from the reticulocytes. The released nuclei contained an undetectable level of ATP, and quickly exposed phosphatidylserine on their surface.

Although the ability of PPAR-gamma agonists to antagonize inflammatory responses by transrepression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) target genes is linked to antidiabetic(4) and antiatherogenic actions(5), the mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we report the identification of a molecular pathway by which PPAR-gamma represses the transcriptional activation of inflammatory response genes in mouse macrophages. The initial step of this pathway involves ligand-dependent SUMOylation of the PPAR-gamma ligand-binding domain, which targets PPAR-gamma to nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR)-histone deacetylase-3 (HDAC3) complexes on inflammatory gene promoters. This in turn prevents recruitment of the ubiquitylation/19S proteosome machinery that normally mediates the signal-dependent removal of corepressor complexes required for gene activation. As a result, NCoR complexes are not cleared from the promoter and target genes are maintained in a repressed state. This mechanism provides an explanation for how an agonist-bound nuclear receptor can be converted from an activator of transcription to a promoter-specific repressor of NF-kappa B target genes that regulate immunity and homeostasis.","Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Cellular & Mol Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, Howard Hughes Med Inst, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, Biomed Sci Grad Program, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; GlaxoSmithKline Inc, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA","Glass, CK (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Cellular & Mol Med, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",cglass@ucsd.edu,,"Perissi, Valentina/0000-0002-3716-0003","NCI NIH HHS [R01 CA052599]; NIDDK NIH HHS [R01 DK091183, R37 DK039949]",,,30,757,789,1,36,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,29-Sep,2005,437,7059,,,,,759,763,,10.1038/nature03988,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,968JD,WOS:000232157900058,16127449.0,No,,,11/20/17,ck,glass,male,0.79,43,na,na

In establishing infection these icosahedral viruses undergo endosomal membrane fusion catalysed by envelope glycoprotein rearrangement of the putative receptor-binding domain III (DIII) and exposure of the hydrophobic fusion loop(2-4). Humoral immunity has an essential protective function early in the course of West Nile virus infection(5,6). Here, we investigate the mechanism of neutralization by the E16 monoclonal antibody that specifically binds DIII. Structurally, the E16 antibody Fab fragment engages 16 residues positioned on four loops of DIII, a consensus neutralizing epitope sequence conserved in West Nile virus and distinct in other flaviviruses. The E16 epitope protrudes from the surface of mature virions in three distinct environments(7), and docking studies predict Fab binding will leave fivefold clustered epitopes exposed. We also show that E16 inhibits infection primarily at a step after viral attachment, potentially by blocking envelope glycoprotein conformational changes.

Pathogenic microorganisms have apparently evolved defence mechanisms that counteract the effects of NO and related reactive nitrogen species. Regulatory proteins that sense NO mediate the primary response to NO and nitrosative stress(3-9). The only regulatory protein in enteric bacteria known to serve exclusively as an NO-responsive transcription factor is the enhancer binding protein NorR (refs 9 - 11). In Escherichia coli, NorR activates the transcription of the nor VW genes encoding a flavorubredoxin (FlRd) and an associated flavoprotein, respectively, which together have NADH-dependent NO reductase activity(10,12-14). The NO-responsive activity of NorR raises important questions concerning the mechanism of NO sensing. Here we show that the regulatory domain of NorR contains a mononuclear non-haem iron centre, which reversibly binds NO. Binding of NO stimulates the ATPase activity of NorR, enabling the activation of transcription by RNA polymerase. The mechanism of NorR reveals an unprecedented biological role for a non-haem mononitrosyl - iron complex in NO sensing.","John Innes Ctr Plant Sci Res, Norwich NR4 7UH, Norfolk, England; Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA","Spiro, S (reprint author), John Innes Ctr Plant Sci Res, Norwich NR4 7UH, Norfolk, England.",stephen.spiro@biology.gatech.edu,"Spiro, Stephen/B-1838-2009","Spiro, Stephen/0000-0001-5975-9984",,,,30,160,161,1,26,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,29-Sep,2005,437,7059,,,,,769,772,,10.1038/nature03953,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,968JD,WOS:000232157900060,16193057.0,No,,,11/20/17,s,spiro,male,0.67,42,na,na

Galaxies in the young Universe have hitherto mainly been identified using their expected optical colours(2 - 4), but this leaves open the possibility that a significant population remains undetected because their colours are the result of a complex mix of stars, gas, dust or active galactic nuclei. Here we report the results of a flux- limited I- band survey of galaxies at look- back times of 9 to 12 billion years. We find 970 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts between 1.4 and 5. This population is 1.6 to 6.2 times larger than previous estimates(2 - 4), with the difference increasing towards brighter magnitudes. Strong ultraviolet continua ( in the rest frame of the galaxies) indicate vigorous star formation rates of more than 10 - 100 solar masses per year. As a consequence, the cosmic star formation rate representing the volume- averaged production of stars is higher than previously measured at redshifts of 3 to 4.","Univ Aix Marseille 1, CNRS, UMR 6110, OAMP,Lab Astrophys Marseille, F-13376 Marseille, France; Max Planck Inst Astrophys, D-85741 Garching, Germany; Inst Astrophys, UMR 7095, F-75014 Paris, France; IASF INAF, I-20133 Milan, Italy; Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Astron, I-40127 Bologna, Italy; Osservatorio Astron Bologna, INAF, I-40127 Bologna, Italy; Observ Midi Pyrenees, UMR 5572, Astrophys Lab, F-31400 Toulouse, France; IRA INAF, I-40129 Bologna, Italy; European So Observ, D-85748 Garching, Germany; Osserv Astron Brera, INAF, Milan, Italy; Osserv Astron Capodimonte, INAF, I-80131 Naples, Italy; Observ Paris, LERMA, F-75014 Paris, France","Le Fevre, O (reprint author), Univ Aix Marseille 1, CNRS, UMR 6110, OAMP,Lab Astrophys Marseille, BP8, F-13376 Marseille, France.",Olivier.LeFevre@oamp.fr,"Pello, Roser/G-4754-2010; Le Fevre, Olivier/G-7389-2011; Merighi, Roberto/O-9360-2015; Cappi, Alberto/O-9391-2015; Zucca, Elena/O-9396-2015; Bolzonella, Micol/O-9495-2015; Bardelli, Sandro/O-9369-2015; Guzzo, Luigi/R-4939-2017","Pozzetti, Lucia/0000-0001-7085-0412; Ciliegi, Paolo/0000-0002-0447-4620; Merighi, Roberto/0000-0003-2490-1834; Cappi, Alberto/0000-0002-9200-7167; Zucca, Elena/0000-0002-5845-8132; Bolzonella, Micol/0000-0003-3278-4607; Bardelli, Sandro/0000-0002-8900-0298; Iovino, Angela/0000-0001-6958-0304; bottini, dario/0000-0001-6917-041X; Franzetti, Paolo/0000-0002-6986-0127; Scaramella, Roberto/0000-0003-2229-193X; Arnaboldi, Magda/0000-0001-7214-3009; Zanichelli, Alessandra/0000-0002-2893-023X; Busarello, Giovanni/0000-0002-4253-7100; Radovich, Mario/0000-0002-3585-866X; Garilli, Bianca/0000-0001-7455-8750; Zamorani, Giovanni/0000-0002-2318-301X; Bongiorno, Angela/0000-0002-0101-6624; Scodeggio, Marco/0000-0002-2282-5850; Merluzzi, Paola/0000-0003-3966-2397",,,,21,50,50,0,5,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Sep,2005,437,7058,,,,,519,521,,10.1038/nature03979,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,966FF,WOS:000232004800042,16177783.0,No,,,11/20/17,d,rizzo,male,0.79,43,na,na

Thyristors are widely used as inverters ( direct to alternating current converters) and for the smooth control of power in a variety of applications such as motors and refrigerators. Materials and structures that exhibit nonlinear resistance of this sort are not only useful for practical applications: they also provide systems for exploring fundamental aspects of solid- state and statistical physics. Here we report the discovery of a giant nonlinear resistance effect in the conducting organic salt(2) theta- ( BEDT- TTF) 2CsCo( SCN)(4), the voltage- current characteristics of which are essentially the same as those of a conventional thyristor. This intrinsic organic thyristor works as an inverter, generating an alternating current when a static direct- current voltage is applied. Whereas conventional thyristors consist of a series of diodes ( their nonlinearity comes from interface effects at the p- n junctions), the present salt exhibits giant nonlinear resistance as a bulk phenomenon. We attribute the origin of this effect to the current-induced melting of insulating charge- order domains, an intrinsically non- equilibrium phenomenon in the sense that ordered domains are melted by a steady flow.","Waseda Univ, Dept Appl Phys, Tokyo 1698555, Japan; Inst Solid State Phys, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778581, Japan; Japan Sci & Technol Corp, CREST, Kawaguchi 3320012, Japan; Tokyo Inst Technol, Dept Organ & Polymer Mat, Tokyo 1528552, Japan; Tohoku Univ, Inst Multidisciplinary Res Adv Mat, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan; Japan Synchrotron Radiat Res Inst, Mikazuki, Hyogo 6795198, Japan; Okayama Univ, Grad Sch Nat Sci & Technol, Okayama 7008530, Japan","Terasaki, I (reprint author), Waseda Univ, Dept Appl Phys, Tokyo 1698555, Japan.",terra@waseda.jp,"NOGAMI, Yoshio/B-1502-2011; IKEDA, Naoshi/B-2587-2011; TERASAKI, Ichiro/I-7083-2014","TERASAKI, Ichiro/0000-0002-6073-2639; Watanabe, Masashi/0000-0002-8004-3208; Mori, Takehiko/0000-0002-0578-5885",,,,13,153,153,3,36,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Sep,2005,437,7058,,,,,522,524,,10.1038/nature04087,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,966FF,WOS:000232004800043,16177784.0,No,,,11/20/17,y,noda,na,na,na,na,na

The phase exhibits the simultaneous presence of finite local- order parameters of helices and smectic layers, without any discontinuity on a mesoscopic length scale. The anomalous softening of elasticity due to a strong reduction in entropy caused by mixing the monomer and the twin permits the seamless coexistence of these two competing liquid crystal orders. The new phase spontaneously exhibits an optically isotropic but uniformly iridescent colour and automatically acquires spherical symmetry, so that the associated photonic band gap(6 - 9) maintains the same symmetry despite the local liquid crystalline order. We expect a range of unusual optical transmission properties based on this three-dimensional isotropic structure, and complete tunability due to the intrinsic softness and responsiveness of the liquid crystalline order against external fields.","ERATO, Yokoyama Nanostruct Liquid Crystal Project, JST, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3002635, Japan; AIST, Nanotechnol Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058568, Japan","Yamamoto, J (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Phys, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan.",jun@junyamamoto.jp,,,,,,17,36,36,0,31,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Sep,2005,437,7058,,,,,525,528,,10.1038/nature04034,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,966FF,WOS:000232004800044,16177785.0,No,,,11/20/17,h,yokoyama,male,0.85,13,na,na

But although severe regional heatwaves may become more frequent in a changing climate(3,4), their impact on terrestrial carbon cycling is unclear. Here we report measurements of ecosystem carbon dioxide fluxes, remotely sensed radiation absorbed by plants, and country- level crop yields taken during the European heatwave in 2003. We use a terrestrial biosphere simulation model(5) to assess continental- scale changes in primary productivity during 2003, and their consequences for the net carbon balance. We estimate a 30 per cent reduction in gross primary productivity over Europe, which resulted in a strong anomalous net source of carbon dioxide ( 0.5 Pg Cyr(-1)) to the atmosphere and reversed the effect of four years of net ecosystem carbon sequestration(6). Our results suggest that productivity reduction in eastern and western Europe can be explained by rainfall deficit and extreme summer heat, respectively. We also find that ecosystem respiration decreased together with gross primary productivity, rather than accelerating with the temperature rise. Model results, corroborated by historical records of crop yields, suggest that such a reduction in Europe's primary productivity is unprecedented during the last century. An increase in future drought events could turn temperate ecosystems into carbon sources, contributing to positive carbon- climate feedbacks already anticipated in the tropics and at high latitudes(1,2).","Lab Sci Climat & Environm, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; Univ Tuscia, DISAFRI, Dept Forest Environm & Resources, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy; Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; Ctr Nancy, F-54280 Champenoux, France; INRA, Ephyse, Funct Ecol & Environm Phys, F-33612 Villenave Dornon, France; INRA, Grassland Ecosyst Res, F-63039 Clermont Ferrand, France; ETH Zentrum, Inst Plant Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; Fac Sci Agron Etat Gembloux, B-5030 Gembloux, Belgium; Tech Univ Dresden, Dept Meteorol, Inst Hydrol & Meteorol, D-01062 Dresden, Germany; Fdn CEAM, E-46980 Valencia, Spain; Univ Helsinki, Dept Phys Sci, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07701 Jena, Germany; Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Ecosyst Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Lab Glaciol & Geophys Environm, F-38402 St Martin Dheres, France; Commiss European Communities, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, I-21020 Ispra, Italy; CNR, IBIMET, I-50144 Florence, Italy; CNRS, DREAM CEFE, F-34293 Montpellier, France; Riso Natl Lab, Biosyst Dept, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark","Ciais, P (reprint author), Lab Sci Climat & Environm, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France.",philippe.ciais@cea.fr,"Seufert, Gunther/J-9918-2013; de NOBLET, Nathalie/O-8613-2015; Matteucci, Giorgio/N-3526-2015; Miglietta, Franco/B-6137-2008; Miglietta, Franco/A-1257-2009; Allard , Vincent/B-8806-2009; Buchmann, Nina/E-6095-2011; Valentini, Riccardo/D-1226-2010; Krinner, Gerhard/A-6450-2011; Ogee, Jerome/C-7185-2013; Pilegaard, Kim/I-7137-2013; Knohl, Alexander/F-9453-2014; Schulze, Ernst-Detlef/K-9627-2014; Carrara, Arnaud/L-8144-2014; Sanz Sanchez, Maria Jose/A-6099-2016; Chevallier, Frederic/E-9608-2016; Friedlingstein, Pierre/H-2700-2014; Soussana, Jean-Francois/P-2094-2016; Vesala, Timo/C-3795-2017; Reichstein, Markus/A-7494-2011; Soussana, Jean-Francois/M-2814-2017","Seufert, Gunther/0000-0002-6019-6688; Matteucci, Giorgio/0000-0002-4790-9540; Miglietta, Franco/0000-0003-1474-8143; Valentini, Riccardo/0000-0002-6756-5634; Krinner, Gerhard/0000-0002-2959-5920; Pilegaard, Kim/0000-0002-5169-5717; Knohl, Alexander/0000-0002-7615-8870; Sanz Sanchez, Maria Jose/0000-0003-0471-3094; Chevallier, Frederic/0000-0002-4327-3813; Soussana, Jean-Francois/0000-0002-1932-6583; Vesala, Timo/0000-0002-4852-7464; Reichstein, Markus/0000-0001-5736-1112; rambal, serge/0000-0001-5869-8382; Papale, Dario/0000-0001-5170-8648; Keronen, Petri/0000-0001-5019-0904",,,,28,1355,1433,53,766,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Sep,2005,437,7058,,,,,529,533,,10.1038/nature03972,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,966FF,WOS:000232004800045,16177786.0,No,,,11/20/17,r,valentini,male,0.79,42,na,na

Such timescales can be assessed, however, with natural radioactive-decay- chain nuclides, because chemical disruption to secular equilibrium systems initiates parent - daughter disequilibria, which re- equilibrate by the shorter half- life in a pair. Here we use (210) Pb - (226) Ra - (230) Th radioactive disequilibria and other geochemical attributes in oceanic basalts less than 20 years old to infer that melts of the Earth's mantle can be transported, accumulated and erupted in a few decades. This implies that magmatic conditions can fluctuate rapidly at ridge volcanoes. (210) Pb deficits of up to 15 per cent relative to (226) Ra occur in normal mid- ocean ridge basalts, with the largest deficits in the most magnesium- rich lavas. The 22- year half- life of (210) Pb requires very recent fractionation of these two uranium- series nuclides. Relationships between (210) Pb- deficits, ( (226) Ra/ (230) Th) activity ratios and compatible trace- element ratios preclude crustal- magma differentiation or daughter- isotope degassing as the main causes for the signal. A mantle- melting model(2) can simulate observed disequilibria but preservation requires a subsequent mechanism to transport melt rapidly. The likelihood of magmatic disequilibria occurring before melt enters shallow crustal magma bodies also limits differentiation and heat replenishment timescales to decades at the localities studied.","Univ Hawaii, Hawaii Ctr Volcanol, Dept Geol & Geophys, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA","Rubin, KH (reprint author), Univ Hawaii, Hawaii Ctr Volcanol, Dept Geol & Geophys, 1680 East West Rd, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",krubin@hawaii.edu,"Rubin, Kenneth/B-3685-2008","Rubin, Kenneth/0000-0002-8554-1337",,,,30,83,84,0,11,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Sep,2005,437,7058,,,,,534,538,,10.1038/nature03993,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,966FF,WOS:000232004800046,16177787.0,No,,,11/20/17,ec,bergmanis,female,0.5,12,na,na

Statistically significant variations of b values have been measured in laboratory experiments, mines and various tectonic regimes such as subducting slabs, near magma chambers, along fault zones and in aftershock zones(3). However, it has remained uncertain whether these differences are due to differing stress regimes, as it was questionable that samples in small volumes ( such as in laboratory specimens, mines and the shallow Earth's crust) are representative of earthquakes in general. Given the lack of physical understanding of these differences, the observation that b values approach the constant 1 if large volumes are sampled(4) was interpreted to indicate that b = 1 is a universal constant for earthquakes in general(5). Here we show that the b value varies systematically for different styles of faulting. We find that normal faulting events have the highest b values, thrust events the lowest and strike- slip events intermediate values. Given that thrust faults tend to be under higher stress than normal faults we infer that the b value acts as a stress meter that depends inversely on differential stress.","Swiss Fed Inst Technol, ETH Honggerberg, Swiss Seismol Serv, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; World Agcy Planetary Monitoring & Earthquake Risk, CH-1207 Geneva, Switzerland","Schorlemmer, D (reprint author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, ETH Honggerberg, Swiss Seismol Serv, Schafmattstr 30, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",danijel@sed.ethz.ch,"Wiemer, Stefan/E-5033-2015","Wiemer, Stefan/0000-0002-4919-3283",,,,28,304,315,4,42,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,22-Sep,2005,437,7058,,,,,539,542,,10.1038/nature04094,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,966FF,WOS:000232004800047,16177788.0,No,,,11/20/17,m,wyss,male,0.74,158,na,na

The limited physiological diversity among cultivated Archaea suggested that these organisms were metabolically constrained to a few environmental niches. For instance, all Crenarchaeota that are currently cultivated are sulphur-metabolizing thermophiles(1). However, landmark studies using cultivation- independent methods uncovered vast numbers of Crenarchaeota in cold oxic ocean waters(2,3). Subsequent molecular surveys demonstrated the ubiquity of these low- temperature Crenarchaeota in aquatic and terrestrial environments(4). The numerical dominance of marine Crenarchaeota - estimated at 10(28) cells in the world's oceans(5) - suggests that they have a major role in global biogeochemical cycles. Indeed, isotopic analyses of marine crenarchaeal lipids suggest that these planktonic Archaea fix inorganic carbon(6).

This view is based on field surveys and controlled experiments showing that species richness correlates negatively with high productivity(1,2) and nitrogen enrichment(3). However, as the type of nutrient limitation has never been examined on a large geographical scale the causality of these relationships is uncertain. We investigated species richness in herbaceous terrestrial ecosystems, sampled along a transect through temperate Eurasia that represented a gradient of declining levels of atmospheric nitrogen deposition - from similar to 50 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) in western Europe to natural background values of less than 5 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) in Siberia(4). Here we show that many more endangered plant species persist under phosphorus- limited than under nitrogen- limited conditions, and we conclude that enhanced phosphorus is more likely to be the cause of species loss than nitrogen enrichment. Our results highlight the need for a better understanding of the mechanisms of phosphorus enrichment, and for a stronger focus on conservation management to reduce phosphorus availability.","Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev & Innovat, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; ETH, Geobot Inst, CH-8044 Zurich, Switzerland; Tomsk VV Kuibyshev State Univ, Dept Bot, Tomsk 634050, Russia; Univ Greifswald, Inst Bot & Landscape Ecol, D-17487 Greifswald, Germany","Wassen, MJ (reprint author), Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev & Innovat, POB 80115, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",m.wassen@geo.uu.nl,"Wassen, Martin/L-9228-2013; olde Venterink, Harry/K-9547-2015","Wassen, Martin/0000-0002-9735-2103; olde Venterink, Harry/0000-0002-8963-1153",,,,30,267,286,6,209,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Sep,2005,437,7058,,,,,547,550,,10.1038/nature03950,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,966FF,WOS:000232004800049,16177790.0,No,,,11/20/17,f,tanneberger,na,na,na,na,na

The orexins ( or hypocretins) are neuropeptides recently identified as neurotransmitters in lateral hypothalamus neurons(5,6). Although knockout and transgenic overexpression studies have implicated orexin neurons in arousal and sleep(7), these cells also project to reward- associated brain regions, including the nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area(8,9). This indicates a possible role for these neurons in reward function and motivation(3,10), consistent with previous studies implicating these neurons in feeding(6). Here we show that activation of lateral hypothalamus orexin neurons is strongly linked to preferences for cues associated with drug and food reward. In addition, we show that chemical activation of lateral hypothalamus orexin neurons reinstates an extinguished drug- seeking behaviour. This reinstatement effect was completely blocked by prior administration of an orexin A antagonist. Moreover, administration of the orexin A peptide directly into the ventral tegmental area also reinstated drug- seeking. These data reveal a new role for lateral hypothalamus orexin neurons in reward- seeking, drug relapse and addiction.","Univ Penn, Dept Psychiat, Lab Neuromodulat & Behav, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Harris, GC (reprint author), Univ Penn, Dept Psychiat, Lab Neuromodulat & Behav, 705 Stellar Chance 6100,422 Curie Blvd, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",glenda@dolphin.upenn.edu,,,,,,31,696,710,1,44,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Sep,2005,437,7058,,,,,556,559,,10.1038/nature04071,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,966FF,WOS:000232004800051,16100511.0,No,,,11/20/17,g,aston-jones,male,0.83,23,na,na

Decapentaplegic ( Dpp), a member of the transforming growth factor-beta ( TGF-beta) superfamily, embodies the activity of the A/ P organizer. It is produced at the A/ P organizer and distributes in a gradient of decreasing concentration to regulate target genes, functioning non- autonomously to regulate growth and patterning of both the anterior and posterior compartments(1 - 3). Wingless ( Wg) is produced at the D/ V organizer and embodies its activity(4,5). The mechanisms that distribute Dpp and Wg are not known, but proposed mechanisms include extracellular diffusion(6), successive transfers between neighbouring cells(7,8), vesicle- mediated movement(9), and direct transfer via cytonemes(10). Cytonemes are actin-based filopodial extensions that have been found to orient towards the A/ P organizer from outlying cells. Here we show that in the wing disc, cytonemes orient towards both the A/ P and D/ V organizers, and that their presence and orientation correlates with Dpp signalling. We also show that the Dpp receptor, Thickveins ( Tkv), is present in punctae that move along cytonemes. These observations are consistent with a role for cytonemes in signal transduction.","Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem & Biophys, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Kornberg, TB (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem & Biophys, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",tkornberg@biochem.ucsf.edu,,,,,,24,117,119,0,8,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Sep,2005,437,7058,,,,,560,563,,10.1038/nature03951,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,966FF,WOS:000232004800052,16177792.0,No,,,11/20/17,tb,kornberg,male,0.67,3,na,na

Both Zmpste24- and Lmna- deficient mice exhibit profound nuclear architecture abnormalities and multiple histopathological defects that phenocopy an accelerated ageing process(1,2,4,5). Similarly, diverse human progeroid syndromes are caused by mutations in ZMPSTE24 or LMNA genes(6 - 10). To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying these devastating diseases, we have analysed the transcriptional alterations occurring in tissues from Zmpste24- deficient mice. We demonstrate that Zmpste24 deficiency elicits a stress signalling pathway that is evidenced by a marked upregulation of p53 target genes, and accompanied by a senescence phenotype at the cellular level and accelerated ageing at the organismal level. These phenotypes are largely rescued in Zmpste24 (-/-) Lmna (+/-) mice and partially reversed in Zmpste24 (-/-) p53 (-/-) mice. These findings provide evidence for the existence of a checkpoint response activated by the nuclear abnormalities caused by prelamin A accumulation, and support the concept that hyperactivation of the tumour suppressor p53 may cause accelerated ageing(11).","Inst Univ Oncol, Fac Med, Dept Bioquim & Biol Mol, Oviedo, Spain; Univ Oviedo, Dept Morfol & Biol Celular, E-33006 Oviedo, Spain; Karolinska Inst, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Div Matrix Biol, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; NCI, Frederick, MD 21702 USA","Lopez-Otin, C (reprint author), Inst Univ Oncol, Fac Med, Dept Bioquim & Biol Mol, Oviedo, Spain.",clo@uniovi.es,"; Freije, Jose M.P./A-6535-2008; zhou, zhongjun/D-4818-2012; Pendas, Alberto/L-1017-2014; Varela, Ignacio/G-1699-2016; Lopez-Otin, Carlos/C-6657-2013; Folgueras, Alicia/B-3281-2017","Pendas, Alberto M/0000-0001-9264-3721; Freije, Jose M.P./0000-0002-4688-8266; Varela, Ignacio/0000-0002-0969-506X; Lopez-Otin, Carlos/0000-0001-6964-1904; Folgueras, Alicia/0000-0003-3426-9502; Gutierrez-Fernandez, Ana/0000-0002-9287-8843",,,,30,256,270,0,14,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Sep,2005,437,7058,,,,,564,568,,10.1038/nature04019,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,966FF,WOS:000232004800053,16079796.0,No,,,11/20/17,c,lopez-otin,male,0.74,27,na,na

These scaffold proteins may themselves be modulated by hormones(2 - 4). In adipocytes, stimulation of beta- adrenergic receptors increases cyclic AMP levels and activates protein kinase A ( PKA)(5), which stimulates lipolysis by phosphorylating hormone- sensitive lipase and perilipin(6 - 8). Acute insulin treatment activates phosphodiesterase 3B, reduces cAMP levels and quenches beta- adrenergic receptor signalling(9). In contrast, chronic hyperinsulinaemic conditions ( typical of type 2 diabetes) enhance beta- adrenergic receptor- mediated cAMP production(10). This amplification of cAMP signalling is paradoxical because it should enhance lipolysis, the opposite of the known short- term effect of hyperinsulinaemia. Here we show that in adipocytes, chronically high insulin levels inhibit beta- adrenergic receptors ( but not other cAMP- elevating stimuli) from activating PKA. We measured this using an improved fluorescent reporter and by phosphorylation of endogenous cAMP- response- element binding protein ( CREB). Disruption of PKA scaffolding mimics the interference of insulin with beta- adrenergic receptor signalling. Chronically high insulin levels may disrupt the close apposition of beta- adrenergic receptors and PKA, identifying a new mechanism for crosstalk between heterologous signal transduction pathways.","Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Pharmacol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, Div Endocrinol & Metab, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Chem & Biochem, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, Howard Hughes Med Inst, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Tsien, RY (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Pharmacol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",rtsien@ucsd.edu,,,,,,26,191,201,3,10,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Sep,2005,437,7058,,,,,569,573,,10.1038/nature04140,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,966FF,WOS:000232004800054,16177793.0,No,,,11/20/17,ry,tsien,na,na,na,na,na

It acts principally through stimulation of cAMP- dependent protein kinases ( PKAs)(1,2) but also activates certain ion channels and guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( Epacs)(3). Metabolism of cAMP is catalysed by phosphodiesterases ( PDEs) (4,5). Here we identify a cAMP- responsive signalling complex maintained by the muscle-specific A- kinase anchoring protein ( mAKAP) that includes PKA, PDE4D3 and Epac1. These intermolecular interactions facilitate the dissemination of distinct cAMP signals through each effector protein. Anchored PKA stimulates PDE4D3 to reduce local cAMP concentrations, whereas an mAKAP- associated ERK5 kinase module suppresses PDE4D3. PDE4D3 also functions as an adaptor protein that recruits Epac1, an exchange factor for the small GTPase Rap1, to enable cAMP- dependent attenuation of ERK5. Pharmacological and molecular manipulations of the mAKAP complex show that anchored ERK5 can induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Thus, two coupled cAMP- dependent feedback loops are coordinated within the context of the mAKAP complex, suggesting that local control of cAMP signalling by AKAP proteins is more intricate than previously appreciated.","Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Vollum Inst, Portland, OR 97239 USA; Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Pediat, Portland, OR 97239 USA","Scott, JD (reprint author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Vollum Inst, Portland, OR 97239 USA.",scott@ohsu.edu,,"Kapiloff, Michael/0000-0002-7005-6953","NHLBI NIH HHS [R01 HL075398, R01 HL075398-02, R01 HL088366]; NIDDK NIH HHS [P01 DK054441]",,,30,347,361,0,17,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Sep,2005,437,7058,,,,,574,578,,10.1038/nature03966,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,966FF,WOS:000232004800055,16177794.0,No,,,11/20/17,jd,scott,male,0.88,122,na,na

Construction of artificial protein sequences directed only by the SCA showed that the information extracted by this analysis is sufficient to engineer the WW fold at atomic resolution. Here, we demonstrate that these artificial WW sequences function like their natural counterparts, showing class-specific recognition of proline- containing target peptides(5 - 8).

We propose that the abrogation of JunB/activator protein 1 (AP-1) in keratinocytes triggers chemokine/cytokine expression, which recruits neutrophils and macrophages to the epidermis thereby contributing to the phenotypic changes observed in psoriasis. Thus, these data support the hypothesis that epidermal alterations are sufficient to initiate both skin lesions and arthritis in psoriasis.","Res Inst Mol Pathol, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; Deutsch Krebsforschungszentrum, Div Signal Transduct & Growth Control, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; Deutsch Krebsforschungszentrum, Div Mol Genet, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; Med Univ Vienna, Dept Dermatol, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; Ctr Rech & Invest Epiderm & Sensorielles, F-9251 Neuilly, France","Wagner, EF (reprint author), Res Inst Mol Pathol, Dr Bohr Gasse 7, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",wagner@imp.univie.ac.at,"Wagner, Erwin/G-9637-2012","Wagner, Erwin/0000-0001-7872-0196; Eferl, Robert/0000-0002-6074-7144; Tschachler, Erwin/0000-0002-0248-1798; Kenner, Lukas/0000-0003-2184-1338",,,,50,337,359,1,25,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Sep,2005,437,7057,,,,,369,375,,10.1038/nature03963,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,964AS,WOS:000231849100044,16163348.0,No,,,11/20/17,ef,wagner,male,0.67,3,na,na

Here we report the discovery of a quasar lying at the edge of a gas cloud, whose size is comparable to that of a small galaxy, but whose spectrum shows no evidence for stars. The gas in the cloud is excited by the quasar itself. If a host galaxy is present, it is at least six times fainter than would normally be expected(8,9) for such a bright quasar.

Oxygen isotopes in planetary materials show variations at the per cent level that are not related to the mass of the isotopes(1,2); rather, they result from the mixture of components having different nucleosynthetic or chemical origins(1-3). Isotopic variations reaching orders of magnitude in minute meteoritic grains are usually attributed to stellar nucleosynthesis before the birth of the Solar System, whereby different grains were contributed by different stars(4,5). Here we report the discovery of abundant silica-rich grains embedded in meteoritic organic matter, having the most extreme O-18/O-16 and O-17/O-16 ratios observed (both similar to 10(-1)) together with a solar silicon isotopic composition. Both O and Si isotopes indicate a single nucleosynthetic process. These compositions can be accounted for by one of two processes: a single exotic evolved star seeding the young Solar System(6), or irradiation of the circumsolar gas by high energy particles accelerated during an active phase of the young Sun. We favour the latter interpretation, because the observed compositions are usually not expected from nucleosynthetic processes in evolved stars, whereas they are predicted by the selective trapping of irradiation products.","Ctr Rech Petrog & Geochim, F-54501 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France; Museum Natl Hist Nat, Lab Etud Mat Extraterr, F-75005 Paris, France; Ctr Spectrometrie Nucl & Spectrometrie Masse, F-91405 Orsay, France; Ecole Natl Super Chim Paris, Lab Chim Bioorgan & Organ Phys, F-75231 Paris, France","Aleon, J (reprint author), Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Glenn T Seaborg Inst, POB 808,L-231, Livermore, CA 94550 USA.",aleon2@llnl.gov,"Derenne, Sylvie/I-9853-2014","Derenne, Sylvie/0000-0002-3446-9312",,,,30,24,24,0,5,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Sep,2005,437,7057,,,,,385,388,,10.1038/nature03947,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,964AS,WOS:000231849100047,16163350.0,No,,,11/20/17,s,derenne,male,0.67,42,na,na

This establishes a new functionality for magneto-electronic structures that are more commonly used as magnetic field sensors and magnetic memory elements(9). The microwave power emitted from a single spin torque nano-oscillator (STNO) is at present typically less than 1 nW. To achieve a more useful power level ( on the order of microwatts), a device could consist of an array of phase coherent STNOs, in a manner analogous to arrays of Josephson junctions and larger semiconductor oscillators(10-12). Here we show that two STNOs in close proximity mutually phase-lock - that is, they synchronize, which is a general tendency of interacting nonlinear oscillator systems(13-15). The phase-locked state is distinct, characterized by a sudden narrowing of signal linewidth and an increase in power due to the coherence of the individual oscillators. Arrays of phase-locked STNOs could be used as nanometre-scale reference oscillators. Furthermore, phase control of array elements ( phased array) could lead to nanometre-scale directional transmitters and receivers for wireless communications.","Natl Inst Stand & Technol, Div Electromagnet Technol, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; Hitachi San Jose Res Ctr, San Jose, CA 95120 USA","Kaka, S (reprint author), Natl Inst Stand & Technol, Div Electromagnet Technol, Boulder, CO 80305 USA.",shehzu21@gmail.com,"Silva, Thomas/C-7605-2013","Silva, Thomas/0000-0001-8164-9642",,,,25,517,526,5,110,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,15-Sep,2005,437,7057,,,,,389,392,,10.1038/nature04035,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,964AS,WOS:000231849100048,16163351.0,No,,,11/20/17,ja,katine,male,0.7,77,na,na

Spin-transfer devices may enable high-density, low-power magnetic random access memory(24,25) or direct-current-driven nanometre-sized microwave oscillators.

The rapid release of C-12-enriched biogenic methane as a result of continental-shelf methane hydrate dissociation has been put forward as a possible explanation for this observation(1,7,8). Here we report high-resolution organic carbon-isotope data from well-preserved mudrocks in Yorkshire, UK, which demonstrate that the carbon-isotope excursion occurred in three abrupt stages, each showing a shift of -2 parts per thousand to -3 parts per thousand. Spectral analysis of these carbon-isotope measurements and of high-resolution carbonate abundance data reveals a regular cyclicity. We interpret these results as providing strong evidence that methane release proceeded in three rapid pulses and that these pulses were controlled by astronomically forced changes in climate, superimposed upon longer-term global warming. We also find that the first two pulses of methane release each coincided with the extinction of a large proportion of marine species(9).","Open Univ, Ctr Earth Planetary Space & Astron Res, Dept Earth Sci, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England; Univ Cologne, Inst Geol, D-50674 Cologne, Germany","Kemp, DB (reprint author), Open Univ, Ctr Earth Planetary Space & Astron Res, Dept Earth Sci, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England.",d.kemp@open.ac.uk,"Kemp, David/D-7288-2012",,,,,29,208,213,6,52,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,15-Sep,2005,437,7057,,,,,396,399,,10.1038/nature04037,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,964AS,WOS:000231849100050,16163353.0,No,,,11/20/17,l,schwark,female,0.58,24,na,na

Internal waves are typically the most energetic high-frequency events in the coastal ocean(4-6), displacing water parcels by up to 100 m and generating strong currents and turbulence(7) that mix nutrients into near-surface waters for biological utilization. While internal waves are known to be generated by tidal currents over ocean-bottom topography(8-13), they have also been observed frequently in the absence of any apparent tide topography interactions(1,7,14). Here we present repeated measurements of velocity, density and acoustic backscatter across the Columbia River plume front. These show how internal waves can be generated from a river plume that flows as a gravity current into the coastal ocean. We find that the convergence of horizontal velocities at the plume front causes frontal growth and subsequent displacement downward of near-surface waters. Individual freely propagating waves are released from the river plume front when the front's propagation speed decreases below the wave speed in the water ahead of it. This mechanism generates internal waves of similar amplitude and steepness as internal waves from tide topography interactions observed elsewhere(11), and is therefore important to the understanding of coastal ocean mixing.","Oregon State Univ, Coll Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Nash, JD (reprint author), Oregon State Univ, Coll Ocean & Atmospher Sci, 104 COAS Adm Bldg, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",nash@coas.oregonstate.edu,"Moum, James/A-1880-2012",,,,,29,123,131,0,32,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Sep,2005,437,7057,,,,,400,403,,10.1038/nature03936,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,964AS,WOS:000231849100051,16163354.0,No,,,11/20/17,jn,moum,male,0.8,10,na,na

But this logical predictor of earthquake size(1), unsuccessful for large earthquakes on a strike-slip fault(2), fails also with the giant 1960 Chile earthquake of magnitude 9.5 (ref. 3). Although the time since the preceding earthquake spanned 123 years (refs 4, 5), the estimated slip in 1960, which occurred on a fault between the Nazca and South American tectonic plates, equalled 250 - 350 years' worth of the plate motion(3,6-10). Thus the average interval between such giant earthquakes on this fault should span several centuries(3,9,10). Here we present evidence that such long intervals were indeed typical of the last two millennia. We use buried soils and sand layers as records of tectonic subsidence and tsunami inundation at an estuary midway along the 1960 rupture. In these records, the 1960 earthquake ended a recurrence interval that had begun almost four centuries before, with an earthquake documented by Spanish conquistadors in 1575. Two later earthquakes, in 1737 and 1837, produced little if any subsidence or tsunami at the estuary and they therefore probably left the fault partly loaded with accumulated plate motion that the 1960 earthquake then expended.","Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Fac Agron, Quillota, Chile; Univ Washington, US Geol Survey, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Concepcion, Ctr EULA Chile, Concepcion, Chile; Univ Concepcion, Dept Ciencias Hist & Sociales, Concepcion, Chile; Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Geol Survey Japan, Act Fault Res Ctr, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058567, Japan; Pontificia Univ Catolica Santiago, Inst Geog, Santiago, Chile; NOAA, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; Ctr Earth Sci Studies, Thiruvananthapuram 69603, Kerala, India; Indian Inst Technol, Kanpur 208016, Uttar Pradesh, India; Inst Technol, Dept Geol, Bandung 40132, Indonesia; Meteorol & Geophys Agcy Indonesia, Potential Geophys Div, Jakarta 10720, Indonesia","Cisternas, M (reprint author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Fac Agron, Casilla 4-D, Quillota, Chile.",marco.cisternas@ucv.cl,"Rajendran, CP/F-4424-2012; Sawai, Yuki /D-3216-2013","Rajendran, CP/0000-0002-1477-7705; Sawai, Yuki /0000-0001-7015-4361; Youlton, Cristian/0000-0002-2369-6990",,,,22,265,269,6,72,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Sep,2005,437,7057,,,,,404,407,,10.1038/nature03943,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,964AS,WOS:000231849100052,16163355.0,No,,,11/20/17,m,husni,male,0.74,158,na,na

First, most females revisit and breed with specific, individual males across years, so that their single offspring born in different years are full siblings. Second, relatives in the maternal line, including mothers and daughters, share breeding partners (intra-lineage polygyny) more often than expected by chance. Although these behaviours increased levels of co-ancestry among colony members, there was no concomitant rise in inbreeding. We suggest that when females engage in mate fidelity and intra-lineage polygyny, kin ties among female roost mates will be strengthened, thereby potentially contributing to social group cohesiveness. Our findings reveal the hidden complexity that can underlie polygynous breeding, and highlight a new potential route by which female mate choice could influence social evolution.","Univ London, Queen Mary, Sch Biol Sci, London E1 4NS, England; Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Bristol BS8 1UG, Avon, England","Rossiter, SJ (reprint author), Univ London, Queen Mary, Sch Biol Sci, London E1 4NS, England.",s.j.rossiter@qmul.ac.uk,"Le Comber, Steven/B-8315-2008; Faulkes, Chris/B-8377-2008; Rossiter, Stephen/E-2111-2011","Jones, Gareth/0000-0002-1904-3735",,,,29,39,40,2,26,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Sep,2005,437,7057,,,,,408,411,,10.1038/nature03965,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,964AS,WOS:000231849100053,16163356.0,No,,,11/20/17,g,jones,male,0.83,23,na,na

For tasks in which precision is at a premium, performance would be optimal if no noise were added in movement planning and execution: motor output would be as accurate as possible given the quality of sensory inputs. Here we use visually guided smooth-pursuit eye movements in primates(10) as a testing ground for this notion of optimality. In response to repeated presentations of identical target motions, nearly 92% of the variance in eye trajectory can be accounted for as a consequence of errors in sensory estimates of the speed, direction and timing of target motion, plus a small background noise that is observed both during eye movements and during fixations. The magnitudes of the inferred sensory errors agree with the observed thresholds for sensory discrimination by perceptual systems, suggesting that the very different neural processes of perception and action are limited by the same sources of noise.","Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Physiol, WM Keck Fdn Ctr Integrat Neurosci, Sloan Swartz Ctr Theoret Neurobiol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Princeton Univ, Joseph Henry Labs Phys, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; Princeton Univ, Lewis Sigler Inst Integrat Genom, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Osborne, LC (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Physiol, WM Keck Fdn Ctr Integrat Neurosci, Sloan Swartz Ctr Theoret Neurobiol, Box 0444, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",osborne@phy.ucsf.edu,,"Osborne, Leslie/0000-0002-6080-5279","Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NEI NIH HHS [R01 EY003878, R01 EY003878-25]",,,29,134,134,0,14,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Sep,2005,437,7057,,,,,412,416,,10.1038/nature03961,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,964AS,WOS:000231849100054,16163357.0,No,,,11/20/17,w,bialek,male,0.71,7,na,na

Many quorum signals have significant hydrophobic character, and how these signals are trafficked between bacteria within a population is not understood. Here we show that the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa packages the signalling molecule 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinolone ( pseudomonas quinolone signal; PQS)(2) into membrane vesicles that serve to traffic this molecule within a population. Removal of these vesicles from the bacterial population halts cell - cell communication and inhibits PQS-controlled group behaviour. We also show that PQS actively mediates its own packaging and the packaging of other antimicrobial quinolines produced by P. aeruginosa into vesicles. These findings illustrate that a prokaryote possesses a signal trafficking system with features common to those used by higher organisms and outlines a novel mechanism for delivery of a signal critical for coordinating group behaviour in P. aeruginosa.","Univ Oklahoma, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Periodont, Oklahoma City, OK 73104 USA; Univ Oklahoma, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Oklahoma City, OK 73104 USA","Whiteley, M (reprint author), Univ Oklahoma, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Periodont, Oklahoma City, OK 73104 USA.",marvin-whiteley@ouhsc.edu,,,,,,26,335,344,5,52,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Sep,2005,437,7057,,,,,422,425,,10.1038/nature03925,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,964AS,WOS:000231849100056,16163359.0,No,,,11/20/17,m,whiteley,male,0.74,158,na,na

Previous work showed that the conversion of integrins to a high-affinity state mediates a subset of shear responses, including cell alignment and gene expression(2-4). Here we investigate the pathway upstream of integrin activation. PECAM-1 ( which directly transmits mechanical force), vascular endothelial cell cadherin ( which functions as an adaptor) and VEGFR2 ( which activates phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase) comprise a mechanosensory complex. Together, these receptors are sufficient to confer responsiveness to flow in heterologous cells. In support of the relevance of this pathway in vivo, PECAM-1-knockout mice do not activate NF-kappa B and downstream inflammatory genes in regions of disturbed flow. Therefore, this mechanosensing pathway is required for the earliest-known events in atherogenesis.","Scripps Res Inst, Dept Cell Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; Univ Milan, Mario Negri Inst Pharmacol Res, I-20139 Milan, Italy; Univ Milan, Fac Sci, Dept Biomol & Biotechnol Sci, FIRC Inst Mol Oncol, I-20139 Milan, Italy; Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Phys, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Univ Bern, Theodor Kocher Inst, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; Univ Penn, Med Ctr, Dept Med, Div Pulm & Crit Care, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; Univ Virginia, Mellon Prostate Canc Res Ctr, Cardiovasc Res Ctr, Dept Microbiol, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; Univ Virginia, Mellon Prostate Canc Res Ctr, Cardiovasc Res Ctr, Dept Biomed Engn, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA","Schwartz, MA (reprint author), Scripps Res Inst, Dept Cell Biol, 10550 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",maschwartz@virginia.edu,"Tzima, Ellie/L-9256-2017","Tzima, Ellie/0000-0002-3437-0902; Engelhardt, Britta/0000-0003-3059-9846",,,,30,744,767,9,121,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Sep,2005,437,7057,,,,,426,431,,10.1038/nature03952,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,964AS,WOS:000231849100057,16163360.0,No,,,11/20/17,ma,schwartz,female,0.62,251,na,na

We have shown that the BHC complex is recruited by a neuronal silencer, REST (RE1-silencing transcription factor), and mediates the repression of REST-responsive genes1. BHC is a multiprotein complex consisting of two enzymatic activities: a histone deacetylase (HDAC1 or 2) and a recently described histone demethylase (BHC110, also known as LSD1 or AOF2)(1-3). Here we show that BHC110-containing complexes show a nearly fivefold increase in demethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) compared to recombinant BHC110. Furthermore, recombinant BHC110 is unable to demethylate H3K4 on nucleosomes, but BHC110-containing complexes readily demethylate nucleosomes. In vitro reconstitution of the BHC complex using recombinant subunits reveals an essential role for the REST corepressor CoREST, not only in stimulating demethylation on core histones but also promoting demethylation of nucleosomal substrates. We find that nucleosomal demethylation is the result of CoREST enhancing the association between BHC110 and nucleosomes. Depletion of CoREST in in vivo cell culture results in de-repression of REST-responsive gene expression and increased methylation of H3K4. Together, these results highlight an essential role for CoREST in demethylation of H3K4 both in vitro and in vivo.","Wistar Inst Anat & Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Shiekhattar, R (reprint author), Wistar Inst Anat & Biol, 3601 Spruce St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",shiekhattar@wistar.org,,,,,,23,440,460,2,26,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Sep,2005,437,7057,,,,,432,435,,10.1038/nature04021,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,964AS,WOS:000231849100058,16079794.0,No,,,11/20/17,r,shiekhattar,male,0.79,42,na,na

Gene activation and repression is specifically regulated by histone methylation status at distinct lysine residues(2). Here we show that lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1; also known as BHC110)(3) co-localizes with the androgen receptor in normal human prostate and prostate tumour. LSD1 interacts with androgen receptor in vitro and in vivo, and stimulates androgen-receptor-dependent transcription. Conversely, knockdown of LSD1 protein levels abrogates androgen-induced transcriptional activation and cell proliferation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrate that androgen receptor and LSD1 form chromatin-associated complexes in a ligand-dependent manner. LSD1 relieves repressive histone marks by demethylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3-K9), thereby leading to de-repression of androgen receptor target genes. Furthermore, we identify pargyline as an inhibitor of LSD1. Pargyline blocks demethylation of H3-K9 by LSD1 and consequently androgen-receptor-dependent transcription. Thus, modulation of LSD1 activity offers a new strategy to regulate androgen receptor functions. Here, we link demethylation of a repressive histone mark with androgen-receptor-dependent gene activation, thus providing a mechanism by which demethylases control specific gene expression.","Univ Freiburg Klinikum, Univ Frauenklin, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; Univ Freiburg Klinikum, Zentrum Klin Forsch, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; Max Planck Inst Immunbiol, D-79108 Freiburg, Germany; Novartis Res Fdn, Friedrich Miescher Inst Biomed Res, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland; Univ Klinikum Bonn, Inst Pathol, D-53127 Bonn, Germany","Schule, R (reprint author), Univ Freiburg Klinikum, Univ Frauenklin, Breisacherstr 66, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany.",roland.schuele@uniklinik-freiburg.de,,"Gunther, Thomas/0000-0003-3903-9490",,,,16,891,933,3,61,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Sep,2005,437,7057,,,,,436,439,,10.1038/nature04020,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,964AS,WOS:000231849100059,16079795.0,No,,,11/20/17,r,schule,male,0.79,42,na,na

This biological function results from its ability to tether broken DNA molecules(2,3). hR/M/N's dynamic molecular architecture consists of a globular DNA-binding domain from which two 50-nm-long coiled coils protrude. The coiled coils are flexible(4) and their apices can self-associate(5). The flexibility of the coiled coils allows their apices to adopt an orientation favourable for interaction. However, this also allows interaction between the tips of two coiled coils within the same complex, which competes with and frustrates the intercomplex interaction required for DNA tethering. Here we show that the dynamic architecture of hR/M/N is markedly affected by DNA binding. DNAbinding by the hR/M/N globular domain leads to parallel orientation of the coiled coils; this prevents intracomplex interactions and favours intercomplex associations needed for DNA tethering. The hR/M/N complex thus is an example of a biological nanomachine in which binding to its ligand, in this case DNA, affects the functional conformation of a domain located 50 nm distant.","Delft Univ Technol, Kavli Inst Nanosci, NL-2628 CJ Delft, Netherlands; Erasmus MC, Dept Cell Biol & Genet, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; Erasmus MC, Dept Radiat Oncol, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands","Dekker, C (reprint author), Delft Univ Technol, Kavli Inst Nanosci, Lorentzweg 1, NL-2628 CJ Delft, Netherlands.",c.wyman@erasmusmc.nl; dekker@mb.tn.tudelft.nl,"Moreno-Herrero, Fernando/N-2967-2013","Moreno-Herrero, Fernando/0000-0003-4083-1709; Dekker, Cees/0000-0001-6273-071X; Dekker, Nynke/0000-0003-4029-0973",,,,11,172,177,0,15,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Sep,2005,437,7057,,,,,440,443,,10.1038/nature03927,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,964AS,WOS:000231849100060,16163361.0,No,,,11/20/17,c,dekker,na,na,na,na,na

Although currently incapable of sustained human-to-human transmission, H5N1 represents a serious pandemic threat owing to the risk of a mutation or reassortment generating a virus with increased transmissibility. Identifying public health interventions that might be able to halt a pandemic in its earliest stages is therefore a priority. Here we use a simulation model of influenza transmission in Southeast Asia to evaluate the potential effectiveness of targeted mass prophylactic use of antiviral drugs as a containment strategy. Other interventions aimed at reducing population contact rates are also examined as reinforcements to an antiviral-based containment policy. We show that elimination of a nascent pandemic may be feasible using a combination of geographically targeted prophylaxis and social distancing measures, if the basic reproduction number of the new virus is below 1.8. We predict that a stockpile of 3 million courses of antiviral drugs should be sufficient for elimination. Policy effectiveness depends critically on how quickly clinical cases are diagnosed and the speed with which antiviral drugs can be distributed.","Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Fac Med, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, London W2 1PG, England; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Inst Math Sci, London SW7 2PG, England; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Int Hlth, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; INSERM, U707, F-75571 Paris, France; Univ Hong Kong, Dept Community Med, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; Minist Publ Hlth, Dept Dis Control, Bur Epidemiol, Nonthaburi 11000, Thailand","Ferguson, NM (reprint author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Fac Med, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, St Marys Campus,Norfolk Pl, London W2 1PG, England.",neil.ferguson@imperial.ac.uk,"Ferguson, Neil/B-8578-2008; Riley, Steven/C-4384-2009; Fraser, Christophe/A-8109-2008","Ferguson, Neil/0000-0002-1154-8093; Fraser, Christophe/0000-0003-2399-9657; /0000-0002-5704-8094",,,,36,961,995,7,168,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Sep,2005,437,7056,,,,,209,214,,10.1038/nature04017,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,961YE,WOS:000231696900046,16079797.0,No,,,11/20/17,ds,burke,female,1,2,na,na

These transporters are the targets of therapeutic and illicit compounds, and their dysfunction has been implicated in multiple diseases of the nervous system. Here we present the crystal structure of a bacterial homologue of these transporters from Aquifex aeolicus, in complex with its substrate, leucine, and two sodium ions. The protein core consists of the first ten of twelve transmembrane segments, with segments 1 - 5 related to 6 - 10 by a pseudo-two-fold axis in the membrane plane. Leucine and the sodium ions are bound within the protein core, halfway across the membrane bilayer, in an occluded site devoid of water. The leucine and ion binding sites are defined by partially unwound transmembrane helices, with main-chain atoms and helix dipoles having key roles in substrate and ion binding. The structure reveals the architecture of this important class of transporter, illuminates the determinants of substrate binding and ion selectivity, and defines the external and internal gates.","Columbia Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, New York, NY 10032 USA; Columbia Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10032 USA","Gouaux, E (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, 650 W 168th St, New York, NY 10032 USA.",jeg52@columbia.edu,"Yamashita, Atsuko/H-5566-2017","Yamashita, Atsuko/0000-0002-8001-4642",,,,50,996,1009,2,117,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Sep,2005,437,7056,,,,,215,223,,10.1038/nature03978,,9,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,961YE,WOS:000231696900047,16041361.0,No,,,11/20/17,e,gouaux,male,0.86,21,na,na

The asteroid belt therefore preserves a record of both this earliest epoch of Solar System formation and variation of conditions within the solar nebula. Spectral features in reflected sunlight indicate that some asteroids have experienced sufficient thermal evolution to differentiate into layered structures(1). The second most massive asteroid - 4 Vesta - has differentiated to a crust, mantle and core(2,3). 1 Ceres, the largest and most massive asteroid, has in contrast been presumed to be homogeneous, in part because of its low density, low albedo and relatively featureless visible reflectance spectrum, similar to carbonaceous meteorites that have suffered minimal thermal processing(4). Here we show that Ceres has a shape and smoothness indicative of a gravitationally relaxed object. Its shape is significantly less flattened than that expected for a homogeneous object, but is consistent with a central mass concentration indicative of differentiation.

Their properties vary according to solar activity(2,3) and they represent a hazard to satellites and humans in space(4,5). An important challenge has been to explain how the charged particles within these belts are accelerated to very high energies of several million electron volts. Here we show, on the basis of the analysis of a rare event where the outer radiation belt was depleted and then re-formed closer to the Earth(6), that the long established theory of acceleration by radial diffusion is inadequate; the electrons are accelerated more effectively by electromagnetic waves at frequencies of a few kilohertz. Wave acceleration can increase the electron flux by more than three orders of magnitude over the observed timescale of one to two days, more than sufficient to explain the new radiation belt. Wave acceleration could also be important for Jupiter, Saturn and other astrophysical objects with magnetic fields.","British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; Univ Colorado, Atmospher & Space Phys Lab, Boulder, CO 80303 USA; Augsburg Coll, Dept Phys, Minneapolis, MN 55454 USA; Stanford Univ, STAR Lab, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Univ Iowa, Dept Phys & Astron, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; LPCE, F-45071 Orleans, France","Horne, RB (reprint author), British Antarctic Survey, Madingley Rd, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England.",R.Horne@bas.ac.uk,,"Horne, Richard/0000-0002-0412-6407; Meredith, Nigel/0000-0001-5032-3463",,,,22,286,287,1,38,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,8-Sep,2005,437,7056,,,,,227,230,,10.1038/nature03939,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,961YE,WOS:000231696900049,16148927.0,No,,,11/20/17,pme,decreau,na,na,na,na,na

These transitions often occur under nonequilibrium conditions and are associated with hysteresis effects - features usually taken to preclude the extraction of equilibrium information from the experimental data. But fluctuation theorems(1-5) allow us to relate the work along nonequilibrium trajectories to thermodynamic free-energy differences. They have been shown to be applicable to single-molecule force measurements(6) and have already provided information on the folding free energy of a RNA hairpin(7,8). Here we show that the Crooks fluctuation theorem(9) can be used to determine folding free energies for folding and unfolding processes occurring in weak as well as strong nonequilibrium regimes, thereby providing a test of its validity under such conditions. We use optical tweezers(10) to measure repeatedly the mechanical work associated with the unfolding and refolding of a small RNA hairpin(11) and an RNA three-helix junction(12). The resultant work distributions are then analysed according to the theorem and allow us to determine the difference in folding free energy between an RNA molecule and a mutant differing only by one base pair, and the thermodynamic stabilizing effect of magnesium ions on the RNA structure.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Merck & Co Inc, Automated Biotechnol Dept, N Wales, PA 19454 USA; Univ Barcelona, Fac Fis, Dept Fis Fonamental, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; Los Alamos Natl Lab, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA","Bustamante, C (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",ritort@ffn.ub.es; carlos@alice.berkeley.edu,"Jarzynski, Christopher/B-4490-2009","Jarzynski, Christopher/0000-0002-3464-2920; Bustamante, Carlos/0000-0002-2970-0073",NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM010840],,,30,539,545,5,114,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Sep,2005,437,7056,,,,,231,234,,10.1038/nature04061,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,961YE,WOS:000231696900050,16148928.0,No,,,11/20/17,c,bustamante,male,0.74,27,na,na

This is because they display the same phase behaviour as atoms or molecules, with the nano- to micrometre size of the colloidal particles making it possible to observe them directly in real space(3,4). Another attractive feature is that different types of colloidal interactions, such as long-range repulsive(1,3), short-range attractive(5), hard-sphere-like(2-4) and dipolar(3), can be realized and give rise to equilibrium phases. However, spherically symmetric, long-range attractions ( that is, ionic interactions) have so far always resulted in irreversible colloidal aggregation(6). Here we show that the electrostatic interaction between oppositely charged particles can be tuned such that large ionic colloidal crystals form readily, with our theory and simulations confirming the stability of these structures. We find that in contrast to atomic systems, the stoichiometry of our colloidal crystals is not dictated by charge neutrality; this allows us to obtain a remarkable diversity of new binary structures. An external electric field melts the crystals, confirming that the constituent particles are indeed oppositely charged. Colloidal model systems can thus be used to study the phase behaviour of ionic species. We also expect that our approach to controlling opposite-charge interactions will facilitate the production of binary crystals of micrometre-sized particles, which could find use as advanced materials for photonic applications(7).","Univ Utrecht, Debye Inst, NL-3584 CC Utrecht, Netherlands; Univ Utrecht, Inst Theoret Phys, NL-3584 CE Utrecht, Netherlands","Leunissen, ME (reprint author), Univ Utrecht, Debye Inst, Princetonpl 5, NL-3584 CC Utrecht, Netherlands.",M.E.Leunissen@phys.uu.nl; A.vanBlaaderen@phys.uu.nl,"Imhof, Arnout/B-6655-2009; Dijkstra, Marjolein/B-6656-2009; van Roij, Rene/E-5163-2011; Campbell, Andrew/F-7690-2013; van Blaaderen, Alfons/B-6304-2009; Institute (DINS), Debye/G-7730-2014","Imhof, Arnout/0000-0002-7445-1360; Campbell, Andrew/0000-0001-6213-0757; van Blaaderen, Alfons/0000-0003-3090-2753; Royall, C.

Our simulations of the precession-driven patterns of river discharge with a global climate model suggest that ocean anoxia and black shale sedimentation were directly caused by high river discharge, and occurred specifically when the northern equinox coincided with perihelion ( the minimum distance between the Sun and the Earth).

The possibility that climate change is being reinforced by increased carbon dioxide emissions from soils owing to rising temperature is the subject of a continuing debate(2-9). But evidence for the suggested feedback mechanism has to date come solely from small-scale laboratory and field experiments and modelling studies(2-9). Here we use data from the National Soil Inventory of England and Wales obtained between 1978 and 2003 to show that carbon was lost from soils across England and Wales over the survey period at a mean rate of 0.6% yr(-1) ( relative to the existing soil carbon content). We find that the relative rate of carbon loss increased with soil carbon content and was more than 2% yr(-1) in soils with carbon contents greater than 100 g kg(-1). The relationship between rate of carbon loss and carbon content is irrespective of land use, suggesting a link to climate change.

Beginning at a depth of about 60 km, we image a large increase in electrical conductivity and a change from isotropic to transversely anisotropic electrical structure, with higher conductivity in the direction of fast propagation for seismic waves. Conductive cooling models predict structure that increases in depth with age, extending to about 30 km at 4.5 Myr ago. We infer, however, that the structure of young oceanic plates is instead controlled by a decrease in water content above a depth of 60 km induced by the melting process beneath the spreading centre(3).","Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Geol & Geophys, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Appl Ocean Phys & Engn, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Inst Res Earth Evolut, Kanagawa 2370061, Japan; Brown Univ, Dept Geol, Providence, RI 02912 USA; GSY USA Inc, San Francisco, CA 94114 USA","Evans, RL (reprint author), Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Geol & Geophys, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.",revans@whoi.edu,"evans, rob/C-6887-2011; Wright, Dawn/A-4518-2011","Wright, Dawn/0000-0002-2997-7611; Chave, Alan/0000-0002-2460-1172; Evans, Robert/0000-0001-5585-0684; Baba, Kiyoshi/0000-0002-2963-2429",,,,28,132,145,1,26,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,8-Sep,2005,437,7056,,,,,249,252,,10.1038/nature04014,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,961YE,WOS:000231696900054,16148932.0,No,,,11/20/17,r,mackie,male,0.79,42,na,na

Such parasite specialization on local hosts has implications for human health and agriculture. By contrast with classic single-species population-genetic models(6,7), theory indicates that parasite migration between subpopulations might increase parasite local adaptation, as long as migration does not completely homogenize populations(8-11). To test this hypothesis we developed a system-specific mathematical model and then coevolved replicate populations of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens and a parasitic bacteriophage with parasite only, with host only or with no migration. Here we show that patterns of local adaptation have considerable temporal and spatial variation and that, in the absence of migration, parasites tend to be locally maladapted. However, in accord with our model, parasite migration results in parasite local adaptation, but host migration alone has no significant effect.","Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; CNRS, UMR 2724, IRD, F-34394 Montpellier, France","Morgan, AD (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PS, England.",andrew.morgan@zoo.ox.ac.uk,"Morgan, Andrew/C-4948-2008",,,,,29,162,162,2,77,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Sep,2005,437,7056,,,,,253,256,,10.1038/nature03913,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,961YE,WOS:000231696900055,16148933.0,No,,,11/20/17,a,buckling,male,0.59,56,na,na

However, questions have arisen as to whether such fibrils or smaller subfibrillar oligomers are the prime causes of disease(1,2). Abnormal deposits in TSEs are rich in PrPres, a protease-resistant form of the PrP protein with the ability to convert the normal, protease-sensitive form of the protein (PrPsen) into PrPres (ref. 3). TSEs can be transmitted between organisms by an enigmatic agent (prion) that contains PrPres (refs 4 and 5). To evaluate systematically the relationship between infectivity, converting activity and the size of various PrPres-containing aggregates, PrPres was partially disaggregated, fractionated by size and analysed by light scattering and non-denaturing gel electrophoresis. Our analyses revealed that with respect to PrP content, infectivity and converting activity peaked markedly in 17 - 27- nm (300 - 600 kDa) particles, whereas these activities were substantially lower in large fibrils and virtually absent in oligomers of <= 5 PrP molecules. These results suggest that non-fibrillar particles, with masses equivalent to 14 - 28 PrP molecules, are the most efficient initiators of TSE disease.","NIAID, Persistent Viral Dis Lab, NIH, Hamilton, MT 59840 USA; NIAID, Electron Microscopy Core Facil, Rocky Mt Labs, NIH, Hamilton, MT 59840 USA","Caughey, B (reprint author), NIAID, Persistent Viral Dis Lab, NIH, Hamilton, MT 59840 USA.",bcaughey@nih.gov,"Sim, Valerie/C-4137-2013","Sim, Valerie/0000-0002-0088-8666",Intramural NIH HHS; NIAID NIH HHS [Z01 AI000580-16],,,27,594,617,2,79,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Sep,2005,437,7056,,,,,257,261,,10.1038/nature03989,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,961YE,WOS:000231696900056,16148934.0,No,,,11/20/17,b,caughey,male,0.65,40,na,na

These atypical proteins, termed prions(3), lack sequence homology but are collectively defined by their capacity to adopt multiple physical and therefore functional states in vivo. Newly synthesized prion protein generally adopts the form already present in the cell, and this in vivo folding bias directs the near faithful transmission of the corresponding phenotypic state(1,2). Switches between the prion and non-prion phenotypes can occur in vivo(2); however, the fate of existing protein during these transitions and its effects on the emergence of new traits remain major unanswered questions. Here, we determine the changes in protein-state that induce phenotypic switching for the yeast prion Sup35/[PSI+]. We show that the prion form does not need to be specified by an alternate misfolding pathway initiated during Sup35 synthesis but instead can be accessed by mature protein. This remodelling of protein from one stable form to another is accompanied by the loss of Sup35 activity, evoking a rapid change in cellular phenotype within a single cell cycle.","Brown Univ, Dept Mol Biol Cell Biol & Biochem, Providence, RI 02912 USA","Serio, TR (reprint author), Brown Univ, Dept Mol Biol Cell Biol & Biochem, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",Tricia_Serio@Brown.edu,,,,,,30,61,64,0,4,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Sep,2005,437,7056,,,,,262,265,,10.1038/nature03981,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,961YE,WOS:000231696900057,16148935.0,No,,,11/20/17,tr,serio,male,1,8,na,na

These include whether fibril-forming proteins have two structurally distinct stable states, native and fibrillar, and whether all or only part of the native protein refolds as it converts to the fibrillar state. Here we show that a designed amyloid-like fibril of the well-characterized enzyme RNase A contains native-like molecules capable of enzymatic activity. In addition, these functional molecular units are formed from a core RNase A domain and a swapped complementary domain. These findings are consistent with the zipper-spine model(3) in which a cross-beta spine is decorated with three-dimensional domain-swapped functional units, retaining native-like structure.","Univ Calif Los Angeles, Howard Hughes Med Inst, UCLA DOE Inst Genom & Proteom, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Eisenberg, D (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Howard Hughes Med Inst, UCLA DOE Inst Genom & Proteom, Box 951570, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",david@mbi.ucla.edu,,"Sawaya, Michael/0000-0003-0874-9043",,,,26,186,188,1,36,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Sep,2005,437,7056,,,,,266,269,,10.1038/nature03916,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,961YE,WOS:000231696900058,16148936.0,No,,,11/20/17,d,eisenberg,male,0.79,43,na,na

The incidence increases with age, and it is often associated with a bicuspid aortic valve present in 1 - 2% of the population(2). Despite the frequency, neither the mechanisms of valve calcification nor the developmental origin of a two, rather than three, leaflet aortic valve is known. Here, we show that mutations in the signalling and transcriptional regulator NOTCH1 cause a spectrum of developmental aortic valve anomalies and severe valve calcification in non-syndromic autosomal-dominant human pedigrees. Consistent with the valve calcification phenotype, Notch1 transcripts were most abundant in the developing aortic valve of mice, and Notch1 repressed the activity of Runx2, a central transcriptional regulator of osteoblast cell fate. The hairy-related family of transcriptional repressors (Hrt), which are activated by Notch1 signalling, physically interacted with Runx2 and repressed Runx2 transcriptional activity independent of histone deacetylase activity. These results suggest that NOTCH1 mutations cause an early developmental defect in the aortic valve and a later de-repression of calcium deposition that causes progressive aortic valve disease.","Univ Texas, SW Med Ctr, Dept Pediat, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; Univ Texas, SW Med Ctr, Dept Mol Biol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; Univ Texas, SW Med Ctr, Dept Internal Med, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; Univ Texas, SW Med Ctr, McDermott Ctr Human Growth & Dev, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; Childrens Med Ctr, Dallas, TX 75235 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Pediat, Div Cardiol, San Diego, CA 92123 USA","Garg, V (reprint author), Univ Texas, SW Med Ctr, Dept Pediat, 6000 Harry Hines Blvd,Room NA8-124, Dallas, TX 75390 USA.",vidu.garg@utsouthwestern.edu; dsrivastava@gladstone.ucsf.edu,"Garg, Vidu/E-3101-2011; Garg, Vidu/D-8240-2012","Garg, Vidu/0000-0002-3778-5927","NHLBI NIH HHS [K08 HL079260-01, K08 HL079260]; NICHD NIH HHS [K08 HD001382]",,,30,665,695,4,41,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Sep,2005,437,7056,,,,,270,274,,10.1038/nature03940,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,961YE,WOS:000231696900059,16025100.0,No,,,11/20/17,d,srivastava,male,0.79,43,na,na

To perform these functions, proliferative basal cells in the innermost layer periodically detach from an underlying basement membrane of extracellular matrix, move outward and eventually die. Once suprabasal, cells stop dividing and enter a differentiation programme to form the barrier(1). The mechanism of stratification is poorly understood. Although studies in vitro have led to the view that stratification occurs through the delamination and subsequent movement of epidermal cells(2-4), most culture conditions favour keratinocytes that lack the polarity and cuboidal morphology of basal keratinocytes in tissue. These features could be important in considering an alternative mechanism, that stratification occurs through asymmetric cell divisions in which the mitotic spindle orients perpendicularly to the basement membrane(5-7). Here we show that basal epidermal cells use their polarity to divide asymmetrically, generating a committed suprabasal cell and a proliferative basal cell. We further demonstrate that integrins and cadherins are essential for the apical localization of atypical protein kinase C, the Par3 - LGN - Inscuteable complex and NuMA - dynactin to align the spindle.","Rockefeller Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10021 USA","Fuchs, E (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10021 USA.",fuchslb@rockefeller.edu,,,"NIAMS NIH HHS [R01 AR027883, R01 AR027883-28]",,,31,552,571,1,33,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Sep,2005,437,7056,,,,,275,280,,10.1038/nature03922,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,961YE,WOS:000231696900060,16094321.0,No,,,11/20/17,e,fuchs,male,0.86,21,na,na

An important mechanism in the stimulation of AP-1 function is amino-terminal phosphorylation of c-Jun by the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs)(2). Phosphorylated c-Jun is biologically more active, partially because it acquires the ability to interact with binding partners. Here we show that phosphorylated c-Jun interacts with the HMG-box transcription factor TCF4 to form a ternary complex containing c-Jun, TCF4 and beta-catenin. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed JNK-dependent c-Jun - TCF4 interaction on the c-jun promoter, and c-Jun and TCF4 cooperatively activated the c-jun promoter in reporter assays in a beta-catenin-dependent manner. In the Apc(Min) mouse model of intestinal cancer(6), genetic abrogation of c-Jun N-terminal phosphorylation(3) or gut-specific conditional c-jun inactivation(4,5) reduced tumour number and size and prolonged lifespan. Therefore, the phosphorylation-dependent interaction between c-Jun and TCF4 regulates intestinal tumorigenesis by integrating JNK and APC/beta-catenin, two distinct pathways activated by WNT signalling.","CR UK London Res Inst, Lincolns Inn Fields Labs, Mammalian Genet Lab, London WC2A 3PX, England; CR UK London Res Inst, Lincolns Inn Fields Labs, Expt Pathol Lab, London WC2A 3PX, England; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Histopathol, London SW7 2AZ, England","Behrens, A (reprint author), CR UK London Res Inst, Lincolns Inn Fields Labs, Mammalian Genet Lab, 44 Lincolns Inn Fields, London WC2A 3PX, England.",axel.behrens@cancer.org.uk,,"Shams Nateri, Abdolrahman/0000-0002-6422-6813",,,,24,227,241,0,13,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Sep,2005,437,7056,,,,,281,285,,10.1038/nature03914,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,961YE,WOS:000231696900061,16007074.0,No,,,11/20/17,a,behrens,male,0.59,56,na,na

The process maintains a transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient that is used, for example, in the synthesis of ATP. In mitochondria and many bacteria, the last enzyme complex in the electron transfer chain is cytochrome c oxidase (CytcO), which catalyses the four-electron reduction of O-2 to H2O using electrons delivered by a water-soluble donor, cytochrome c(1-7). The electron transfer through CytcO, accompanied by proton uptake to form H2O drives the physical movement ( pumping) of four protons across the membrane(8) per reduced O-2. So far, the molecular mechanism of such proton pumping driven by electron transfer has not been determined in any biological system. Here we show that proton pumping in CytcO is mechanistically coupled to proton transfer to O-2 at the catalytic site, rather than to internal electron transfer. This scenario suggests a principle by which redox-driven proton pumps might operate and puts considerable constraints on possible molecular mechanisms by which CytcO translocates protons.","Stockholm Univ, Arrhenius Lab, Dept Biochem & Biophys, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden","Brzezinski, P (reprint author), Stockholm Univ, Arrhenius Lab, Dept Biochem & Biophys, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",peterb@dbb.su.se,,,,,,30,186,188,2,55,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Sep,2005,437,7056,,,,,286,289,,10.1038/nature03921,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,961YE,WOS:000231696900062,16148937.0,No,,,11/20/17,p,brzezinski,male,0.67,6,na,na
