However, large-scale analyses of gene expression evolution were until recently prevented by technological limitations. Here we report the sequencing of polyadenylated RNA from six organs across ten species that represent all major mammalian lineages (placentals, marsupials and monotremes) and birds (the evolutionary outgroup), with the goal of understanding the dynamics of mammalian transcriptome evolution. We show that the rate of gene expression evolution varies among organs, lineages and chromosomes, owing to differences in selective pressures: transcriptome change was slow in nervous tissues and rapid in testes, slower in rodents than in apes and monotremes, and rapid for the X chromosome right after its formation. Although gene expression evolution in mammals was strongly shaped by purifying selection, we identify numerous potentially selectively driven expression switches, which occurred at different rates across lineages and tissues and which probably contributed to the specific organ biology of various mammals.","[Brawand, David; Soumillon, Magali; Necsulea, Anamaria; Julien, Philippe; Weier, Manuela; Liechti, Angelica; Kaessmann, Henrik] Univ Lausanne, Ctr Integrat Genom, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Brawand, David; Soumillon, Magali; Necsulea, Anamaria; Julien, Philippe; Csardi, Gabor; Bergmann, Sven; Kaessmann, Henrik] Swiss Inst Bioinformat, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Csardi, Gabor; Bergmann, Sven] Univ Lausanne, Dept Med Genet, CH-1005 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Harrigan, Patrick; Nielsen, Rasmus] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Aximu-Petri, Ayinuer; Kircher, Martin; Albert, Frank W.; Paeaebo, Svante] Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Anthropol, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Zeller, Ulrich] Humboldt Univ, Chair Systemat Zool, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Khaitovich, Philipp] CAS MPG Partner Inst Computat Biol, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China; [Gruetzner, Frank] Univ Adelaide, Robinson Inst, Sch Mol & Biomed Sci, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Nielsen, Rasmus] Univ Copenhagen, Bioinformat Ctr, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark","Kaessmann, H (reprint author), Univ Lausanne, Ctr Integrat Genom, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",henrik.kaessmann@unil.ch,"Julien, Philippe/C-1295-2011; Kaessmann, Henrik/B-4989-2013; Nielsen, Rasmus/D-4405-2009","Nielsen, Rasmus/0000-0003-0513-6591; Grutzner, Frank/0000-0002-3088-7314; Bergmann, Sven/0000-0002-6785-9034; Kircher, Martin/0000-0001-9278-5471","European Research Council [242597]; Swiss National Science Foundation [31003A_130287, 31003A_130691/1]; Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics; Max Planck Society; FEBS postdoctoral fellowship","We thank K.

Vigorous pancreatic beta-cell replication in juvenile mice and humans declines with age, and elucidating the basis for this decay may reveal strategies for inducing beta-cell expansion, a long-sought goal for diabetes therapy. Here we show that platelet-derived growth factor receptor (Pdgfr) signalling controls age-dependent beta-cell proliferation in mouse and human pancreatic islets. With age, declining beta-cell Pdgfr levels were accompanied by reductions in beta-cell enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (Ezh2) levels and beta-cell replication. Conditional inactivation of the Pdgfra gene in beta-cells accelerated these changes, preventing mouse neonatal beta-cell expansion and adult beta-cell regeneration. Targeted human PDGFR-a activation in mouse beta-cells stimulated Erk1/2 phosphorylation, leading to Ezh2-dependent expansion of adult beta-cells. Adult human islets lack PDGF signalling competence, but exposure of juvenile human islets to PDGF-AA stimulated beta-cell proliferation. The discovery of a conserved pathway controlling age-dependent beta-cell proliferation indicates new strategies for beta-cell expansion.","[Chen, Hainan; Gu, Xueying; Liu, Yinghua; Wang, Jing; Kim, Seung K.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Dev Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Wirt, Stacey E.; Sage, Julien] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Wirt, Stacey E.; Sage, Julien] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Bottino, Rita] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Childrens Hosp Pittsburgh, Div Immunogenet,Dept Pediat, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Schorle, Hubert] Univ Bonn, Sch Med, Inst Pathol, Dept Dev Biol, D-53127 Bonn, Germany; [Kim, Seung K.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med Oncol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kim, Seung K.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Dev Biol, Beckman Ctr B300, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Kim, SK (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Dev Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",seungkim@stanford.edu,"Schorle, Hubert/M-5001-2016","Schorle, Hubert/0000-0001-8272-0076","NIH; NIH-NCI [RO1 CA114102]; Stem Cell Network NRW; Deutsche Krebshilfe; Dewey family fund; Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation; Snyder Foundation; Stinehart Foundation; NIH Beta Cell Biology Consortium [UO1 DK89532, UO1 DK89572]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)","We thank A.

Correlations between blue straggler frequency and cluster binary star fraction(1), core mass(2) and radial position(3) suggest that mass transfer or mergers in binary stars dominates the production of blue stragglers in open clusters. Analytic models(4,5), detailed observations(6) and sophisticated N-body simulations(7), however, argue in favour of stellar collisions. Here we report that the blue stragglers in long-period binaries in the old(8) (7x10(9)-year) open cluster NGC 188 have companions with masses of about half a solar mass, with a surprisingly narrow mass distribution. This conclusively rules out a collisional origin, as the collision hypothesis predicts a companion mass distribution with significantly higher masses. Mergers in hierarchical triple stars(9) are marginally permitted by the data, but the observations do not favour this hypothesis. The data are highly consistent with a mass transfer origin for the long-period blue straggler binaries in NGC 188, in which the companions would be white dwarfs of about half a solar mass.","[Geller, Aaron M.; Mathieu, Robert D.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Astron, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Geller, Aaron M.] Northwestern Univ, CIERA, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Geller, Aaron M.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Evanston, IL 60208 USA","Geller, AM (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Astron, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",a-geller@northwestern.edu,,,National Science Foundation; US National Science Foundation [AST-0908082]; Wisconsin Space Grant Consortium; Northwestern University,"We thank the staff of the WIYN Observatory and the many graduate and undergraduate students who have assisted in observing NGC 188.

However, current schemes for preparing, processing and measuring them are inefficient. For example, down-conversion provides heralded, but randomly timed, single photons(4), and linear optics gates are inherently probabilistic(5). Here we introduce a deterministic process-coherent photon conversion (CPC)-that provides a new way to generate and process complex, multiquanta states for photonic quantum information applications. The technique uses classically pumped nonlinearities to induce coherent oscillations between orthogonal states of multiple quantum excitations. One example of CPC, based on a pumped four-wave-mixing interaction, is shown to yield a single, versatile process that provides a full set of photonic quantum processing tools. This set satisfies the DiVincenzo criteria for a scalable quantum computing architecture(6), including deterministic multiqubit entanglement gates (based on a novel form of photon-photon interaction), high-quality heralded single-and multiphoton states free from higher-order imperfections, and robust, high-efficiency detection. It can also be used to produce heralded multiphoton entanglement, create optically switchable quantum circuits and implement an improved form of down-conversion with reduced higher-order effects. Such tools are valuable building blocks for many quantum-enabled technologies. Finally, using photonic crystal fibres we experimentally demonstrate quantum correlations arising from a four-colour nonlinear process suitable for CPC and use these measurements to study the feasibility of reaching the deterministic regime with current technology(4,7). Our scheme, which is based on interacting bosonic fields, is not restricted to optical systems but could also be implemented in optomechanical, electromechanical and superconducting systems(8-12) with extremely strong intrinsic nonlinearities. Furthermore, exploiting higher-order nonlinearities with multiple pump fields yields a mechanism for multiparty mediation of the complex, coherent dynamics.","[Langford, N.

During tissue formation, these chiral macromolecules are secreted and undergo self-templating assembly, a process whereby multiple kinetic factors influence the assembly of the incoming building blocks to produce non-equilibrium structures(1,4). A single macromolecule can form diverse functional structures when self-templated under different conditions. Collagen type I, for instance, forms transparent corneal tissues from orthogonally aligned nematic fibres(5), distinctively coloured skin tissues from cholesteric phase fibre bundles(6,7), and mineralized tissues from hierarchically organized fibres(8). Nature's self-templated materials surpass the functional and structural complexity achievable by current top-down and bottom-up fabrication methods(9-12). However, self-templating has not been thoroughly explored for engineering synthetic materials. Here we demonstrate the biomimetic, self-templating assembly of chiral colloidal particles (M13 phage) into functional materials. A single-step process produces long-range-ordered, supramolecular films showing multiple levels of hierarchical organization and helical twist. Three distinct supramolecular structures are created by this approach: nematic orthogonal twists, cholesteric helical ribbons and smectic helicolidal nanofilaments. Both chiral liquid crystalline phase transitions and competing interfacial forces at the interface are found to be critical factors in determining the morphology of the templated structures during assembly. The resulting materials show distinctive optical and photonic properties, functioning as chiral reflector/filters and structural colour matrices. In addition, M13 phages with genetically incorporated bioactive peptide ligands direct both soft and hard tissue growth in a hierarchically organized manner. Our assembly approach provides insight into the complexities of hierarchical assembly in nature and could be expanded to other chiral molecules to engineer sophisticated functional helical-twisted structures.","[Chung, Woo-Jae; Oh, Jin-Woo; Kwak, Kyungwon; Lee, Byung Yang; Meyer, Joel; Wang, Eddie; Lee, Seung-Wuk] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Bioengn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Chung, Woo-Jae; Oh, Jin-Woo; Kwak, Kyungwon; Lee, Byung Yang; Meyer, Joel; Wang, Eddie; Lee, Seung-Wuk] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Phys Biosci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Hexemer, Alexander] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Adv Light Source, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Lee, SW (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Bioengn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",leesw@berkeley.edu,"Kwak, Kyungwon /D-8046-2015","Wang, Eddie/0000-0002-9814-0102; Lee, Byung Yang/0000-0003-0125-2501","National Science Foundation [DMR-0747713]; Center of Integrated Nanomechanical Systems (COINS) of the National Science Foundation [EEC-0832819]; National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research [R21DE018360]; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA); Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Institute at the University of California, Berkeley; Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Korea Research Foundation; Korean government (MOEHRD) [KRF-2006-352-D00048]","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation Early Career Development Award (DMR-0747713), the Center of Integrated Nanomechanical Systems (COINS) of the National Science Foundation (grant no.

Chromium (Cr) is among the emerging proxies for tracking the effects of atmospheric oxygenation on continental weathering; this is because its supply to the oceans is dominated by terrestrial processes that can be recorded in the Cr isotope composition of Precambrian iron formations(3). However, the factors controlling past and present seawater Cr isotope composition are poorly understood. Here we provide an independent and complementary record of marine Cr supply, in the form of Cr concentrations and authigenic enrichment in iron-rich sedimentary rocks. Our data suggest that Cr was largely immobile on land until around 2.48 Gyr ago, but within the 160 Myr that followed-and synchronous with independent evidence for oxygenation associated with the Great Oxidation Event (see, for example, refs 4-6)-marked excursions in Cr content and Cr/Ti ratios indicate that Cr was solubilized at a scale unrivalled in history. As Cr isotope fractionations at that time were muted, Cr must have been mobilized predominantly in reduced, Cr(III), form. We demonstrate that only the oxidation of an abundant and previously stable crustal pyrite reservoir by aerobic-respiring, chemolithoautotrophic bacteria could have generated the degree of acidity required to solubilize Cr(III) from ultramafic source rocks and residual soils(7). This profound shift in weathering regimes beginning at 2.48 Gyr ago constitutes the earliest known geochemical evidence for acidophilic aerobes and the resulting acid rock drainage, and accounts for independent evidence of an increased supply of dissolved sulphate(8) and sulphide-hosted trace elements to the oceans around that time(1,9).

The last major rhyolite eruption before that at Chaiten was the largest volcanic eruption in the twentieth century, at Novarupta volcano, Alaska, in 1912. Because of the historically rare and explosive nature of rhyolite eruptions and because of the surprisingly short warning before the eruption of the Chaiten volcano, any information about the workings of the magmatic system at Chaiten, and rhyolitic systems in general, is important from both the scientific and hazard perspectives. Here we present surface deformation data related to the Chaiten eruption based on radar interferometry observations from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) DAICHI (ALOS) satellite. The data on this explosive rhyolite eruption indicate that the rapid ascent of rhyolite occurred through dyking and that melt segregation and magma storage were controlled by existing faults.","[Wicks, Charles; Lowenstern, Jacob] US Geol Survey, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Carlos de la Llera, Juan] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Ingn, Santiago 7820436, Chile; [Lara, Luis E.] Volcano Hazards Program, Serv Nacl Geol & Mineria, Santiago 8320119, Chile","Wicks, C (reprint author), US Geol Survey, 345 Middlefield Rd, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA.",cwicks@usgs.gov,,"Lowenstern, Jacob/0000-0003-0464-7779",NASA; National Science Foundation; US Geological Survey; US Government,"We thank D.

The rapid conversion of tropical forests for agriculture, timber production and other uses has generated vast, human-dominated landscapes with potentially dire consequences for tropical biodiversity(2-5). Today, few truly undisturbed tropical forests exist, whereas those degraded by repeated logging and fires, as well as secondary and plantation forests, are rapidly expanding(6,7). Here we provide a global assessment of the impact of disturbance and land conversion on biodiversity in tropical forests using a meta-analysis of 138 studies. We analysed 2,220 pairwise comparisons of biodiversity values in primary forests (with little or no human disturbance) and disturbed forests. We found that biodiversity values were substantially lower in degraded forests, but that this varied considerably by geographic region, taxonomic group, ecological metric and disturbance type. Even after partly accounting for confounding colonization and succession effects due to the composition of surrounding habitats, isolation and time since disturbance, we find that most forms of forest degradation have an overwhelmingly detrimental effect on tropical biodiversity. Our results clearly indicate that when it comes to maintaining tropical biodiversity, there is no substitute for primary forests.","[Gibson, Luke; Koh, Lian Pin; Sodhi, Navjot S.] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Biol Sci, Singapore 117543, Singapore; [Lee, Tien Ming] Univ Calif San Diego, Ecol Behav & Evolut Sect, Div Biol Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Lee, Tien Ming] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Koh, Lian Pin] ETH, Dept Environm Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Brook, Barry W.; Bradshaw, Corey J.

Along the walls of the lateral ventricles, immature neuronal progeny migrate in tangentially oriented chains that coalesce into a rostral migratory stream (RMS) connecting the subventricular zone to the olfactory bulb. The adult human subventricular zone, in contrast, contains a hypocellular gap layer separating the ependymal lining from a periventricular ribbon of astrocytes(7). Some of these subventricular zone astrocytes can function as neural stem cells in vitro, but their function in vivo remains controversial. An initial report found few subventricular zone proliferating cells and rare migrating immature neurons in the RMS of adult humans(7). In contrast, a subsequent study indicated robust proliferation and migration in the human subventricular zone and RMS(8,9). Here we find that the infant human subventricular zone and RMS contain an extensive corridor of migrating immature neurons before 18 months of age but, contrary to previous reports(8), this germinal activity subsides in older children and is nearly extinct by adulthood. Surprisingly, during this limited window of neurogenesis, not all new neurons in the human subventricular zone are destined for the olfactory bulb-we describe a major migratory pathway that targets the prefrontal cortex in humans. Together, these findings reveal robust streams of tangentially migrating immature neurons in human early postnatal subventricular zone and cortex. These pathways represent potential targets of neurological injuries affecting neonates.","[Sanai, Nader; Thuhien Nguyen; Ihrie, Rebecca A.; Mirzadeh, Zaman; Tsai, Hui-Hsin; Wong, Michael; Rowitch, David H.; Alvarez-Buylla, Arturo] Univ Calif San Francisco, Eli & Edythe Broad Inst Regenerat Med & Stem Cell, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Sanai, Nader; Thuhien Nguyen; Ihrie, Rebecca A.; Mirzadeh, Zaman; Tsai, Hui-Hsin; Wong, Michael; Rowitch, David H.; Alvarez-Buylla, Arturo] Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Sanai, Nader; Gupta, Nalin; Berger, Mitchel S.; Rowitch, David H.; Alvarez-Buylla, Arturo] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Neurol Surg, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Sanai, Nader; Mirzadeh, Zaman] Barrow Neurol Inst, Barrow Brain Tumor Res Ctr, Phoenix, AZ 85013 USA; [Huang, Eric] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pathol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Garcia-Verdugo, Jose-Manuel] CIBERNED, Unidad Mixta CIPF UVEG, Lab Morfol Celular, Valencia 46012, Spain; [Rowitch, David H.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pediat, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Alvarez-Buylla, A (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Eli & Edythe Broad Inst Regenerat Med & Stem Cell, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",rowitchd@peds.ucsf.edu; abuylla@stemcell.ucsf.edu,"Garcia-Verdugo, Jose Manuel/L-8421-2017","Garcia-Verdugo, Jose Manuel/0000-0001-9872-6499; Huang, Eric/0000-0002-5381-3801",NIH [NS 058180]; Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation [DRG1935-07]; American Association for Cancer Research/National Brain Tumor Society; American Association for Cancer Research; Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation of the United States; John G.

This local-to-global problem is also fundamental to motor control of the arm, because complex mechanical interactions between shoulder and elbow allow a particular amount of motion at one joint to arise from an infinite combination of shoulder and elbow torques(5). Here we show, in humans and rhesus monkeys, that a transcortical pathway through primary motor cortex (M1) resolves this ambiguity during fast feedback control. We demonstrate that single M1 neurons of behaving monkeys can integrate shoulder and elbow motion information into motor commands that appropriately counter the underlying torque within about 50 milliseconds of a mechanical perturbation. Moreover, we reveal a causal link between M1 processing and multi-joint integration in humans by showing that shoulder muscle responses occurring 50 milliseconds after pure elbow displacement can be potentiated by transcranial magnetic stimulation. Taken together, our results show that transcortical processing through M1 permits feedback responses to express a level of sophistication that rivals voluntary control; this provides neurophysiological support for influential theories positing that voluntary movement is generated by the intelligent manipulation of sensory feedback(6,7).","[Pruszynski, J.

However, the use of human iPSCs in the context of genetically inherited human disease will require the correction of disease-causing mutations in a manner that is fully compatible with clinical applications(3,5). The methods currently available, such as homologous recombination, lack the necessary efficiency and also leave residual sequences in the targeted genome(6). Therefore, the development of new approaches to edit the mammalian genome is a prerequisite to delivering the clinical promise of human iPSCs. Here we show that a combination of zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs)(7) and piggyBac(8,9) technology in human iPSCs can achieve biallelic correction of a point mutation (Glu342Lys) in the alpha(1)-antitrypsin (A1AT, also known as SERPINA1) gene that is responsible for alpha(1)-antitrypsin deficiency. Genetic correction of human iPSCs restored the structure and function of A1AT in subsequently derived liver cells in vitro and in vivo. This approach is significantly more efficient than any other gene-targeting technology that is currently available and crucially prevents contamination of the host genome with residual non-human sequences. Our results provide the first proof of principle, to our knowledge, for the potential of combining human iPSCs with genetic correction to generate clinically relevant cells for autologous cell-based therapies.","[Yusa, Kosuke; Rouhani, Foad J.; Bradley, Allan] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Cambridge CB10 1SA, England; [Rashid, S.

The U. maydis secretome also contains about 150 proteins with probable roles in fungal nutrition, fungal cell wall modification and host penetration as well as proteins unlikely to act in the fungal-host interface(4) like a chorismate mutase. Chorismate mutases are key enzymes of the shikimate pathway and catalyse the conversion of chorismate to prephenate, the precursor for tyrosine and phenylalanine synthesis. Root-knot nematodes inject a secreted chorismate mutase into plant cells likely to affect development(5,6). Here we show that the chorismate mutase Cmu1 secreted by U. maydis is a virulence factor. The enzyme is taken up by plant cells, can spread to neighbouring cells and changes the metabolic status of these cells through metabolic priming. Secreted chorismate mutases are found in many plant-associated microbes and might serve as general tools for host manipulation.","[Djamei, Armin; Schipper, Kerstin; Rabe, Franziska; Ghosh, Anupama; Vincon, Volker; Kahnt, Joerg; Kahmann, Regine] Max Planck Inst Terr Microbiol, D-35043 Marburg, Germany; [Schipper, Kerstin] Univ Marburg, Zentrum Synthet Mikrobiol, D-35032 Marburg, Germany; [Osorio, Sonia; Tohge, Takayuki; Fernie, Alisdair R.] Max Planck Inst Mol Plant Physiol, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany; [Feussner, Ivo] Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Feussner, Kirstin; Meinicke, Peter] Univ Gottingen, Inst Microbiol & Genet, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Stierhof, York-Dieter] Univ Tubingen, Ctr Plant Mol Biol, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Schwarz, Heinz] Max Planck Inst Dev Biol, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Macek, Boris; Mann, Matthias] Max Planck Inst Biochem, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany","Kahmann, R (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Terr Microbiol, Karl von Frisch Str 10, D-35043 Marburg, Germany.",kahmann@mpi-marburg.mpg.de,"Schipper, Kerstin /H-4656-2011; Feussner, Ivo/H-9320-2013; Osorio, Sonia/M-2258-2014; Mann, Matthias/A-3454-2013; Macek, Boris/N-1442-2015; Tohge, Takayuki/G-7924-2017","Mann, Matthias/0000-0003-1292-4799; Macek, Boris/0000-0002-1206-2458; Feussner, Ivo/0000-0002-9888-7003; Osorio, Sonia/0000-0002-0159-6091",DFG [DJ64/1-1]; collaborative research Center [SFB593]; LOEWE program of the State of Hesse,"We are thankful to N.

Different strategies aimed at blocking vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors have been developed to inhibit angiogenesis in cancer patients(2). It has become increasingly clear that in addition to its effect on angiogenesis, other mechanisms including a direct effect of VEGF on tumour cells may account for the efficiency of VEGF-blockade therapies(3). Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been described in various cancers including squamous tumours of the skin(4,5). Here we use a mouse model of skin tumours to investigate the impact of the vascular niche and VEGF signalling on controlling the stemness (the ability to self renew and differentiate) of squamous skin tumours during the early stages of tumour progression. We show that CSCs of skin papillomas are localized in a perivascular niche, in the immediate vicinity of endothelial cells. Furthermore, blocking VEGFR2 caused tumour regression not only by decreasing the microvascular density, but also by reducing CSC pool size and impairing CSC renewal properties. Conditional deletion of Vegfa in tumour epithelial cells caused tumours to regress, whereas VEGF overexpression by tumour epithelial cells accelerated tumour growth. In addition to its well-known effect on angiogenesis, VEGF affected skin tumour growth by promoting cancer stemness and symmetric CSC division, leading to CSC expansion. Moreover, deletion of neuropilin-1 (Nrp1), a VEGF co-receptor expressed in cutaneous CSCs, blocked VEGF's ability to promote cancer stemness and renewal. Our results identify a dual role for tumour-cell-derived VEGF in promoting cancer stemness: by stimulating angiogenesis in a paracrine manner, VEGF creates a perivascular niche for CSCs, and by directly affecting CSCs through Nrp1 in an autocrine loop, VEGF stimulates cancer stemness and renewal. Finally, deletion of Nrp1 in normal epidermis prevents skin tumour initiation. These results may have important implications for the prevention and treatment of skin cancers.","[Beck, Benjamin; Driessens, Gregory; Youssef, Khalil Kass; Caauwe, Amelie; Sotiropoulou, Panagiota A.; Lapouge, Gaelle; Candi, Aurelie; Mascre, Guilhem; Drogat, Benjamin; Dekoninck, Sophie; Blanpain, Cedric] Univ Libre Bruxelles, IRIBHM, B-1070 Brussels, Belgium; [Goossens, Steven; Haigh, Jody J.] Univ Ghent VIB, Dept Mol Biomed Res, Vasc Cell Biol Unit, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium; [Goossens, Steven; Kuchnio, Anna; Haigh, Jody J.] UGent Dept Mol Biomed Res, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium; [Kuchnio, Anna; Loges, Sonja; Carmeliet, Peter] VIB, Vesalius Res Ctr, Lab Angiogenesis & Neurovasc Link, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Loges, Sonja; Carmeliet, Peter] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Vesalius Res Ctr, Lab Angiogenesis & Neurovasc Link, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium","Blanpain, C (reprint author), Univ Libre Bruxelles, IRIBHM, 808 Route Lennik, B-1070 Brussels, Belgium.",cedric.blanpain@ulb.ac.be,,"Goossens, Steven/0000-0002-5693-8570; haigh, jody/0000-0002-7319-8922",Brussels Region; Deutsche Krebshilfe; Hamburger Krebsgesellschaft; Roggenbuck Stiftung; Flemish Government; FNRS; Wallonia Region; Fondation Contre le Cancer; ULB foundation; fond Gaston Ithier; European Research Council (ERC); EMBO,"We thank Genetech for providing blocking anti-Nrp1 antibodies and H.

The pursuit of novel therapies to target the residual risk has focused on raising the levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-associated cholesterol in order to exploit its atheroprotective effects(1). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as important posttranscriptional regulators of lipid metabolism and are thus a new class of target for therapeutic intervention(2). MicroRNA-33a and microRNA-33b (miR-33a/b) are intronic miRNAs whose encoding regions are embedded in the sterol-response-element-binding protein genes SREBF2 and SREBF1 (refs 3-5), respectively. These miRNAs repress expression of the cholesterol transporter ABCA1, which is a key regulator of HDL biogenesis. Recent studies in mice suggest that antagonizing miR-33a may be an effective strategy for raising plasma HDL levels(3-5) and providing protection against atherosclerosis(6); however, extrapolating these findings to humans is complicated by the fact that mice lack miR-33b, which is present only in the SREBF1 gene of medium and large mammals. Here we show in African green monkeys that systemic delivery of an anti-miRNA oligonucleotide that targets both miR-33a and miR-33b increased hepatic expression of ABCA1 and induced a sustained increase in plasma HDL levels over 12 weeks. Notably, miR-33 antagonism in this non-human primate model also increased the expression of miR-33 target genes involved in fatty acid oxidation (CROT, CPT1A, HADHB and PRKAA1) and reduced the expression of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis (SREBF1, FASN, ACLY and ACACA), resulting in a marked suppression of the plasma levels of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-associated triglycerides, a finding that has not previously been observed in mice. These data establish, in a model that is highly relevant to humans, that pharmacological inhibition of miR-33a and miR33b is a promising therapeutic strategy to raise plasma HDL and lower VLDL triglyceride levels for the treatment of dyslipidaemias that increase cardiovascular disease risk.","[Rayner, Katey J.; Hussain, Farah N.; van Gils, Janine M.; Ray, Tathagat D.; Sheedy, Frederick J.; Goedeke, Leigh; Fernandez-Hernando, Carlos; Fisher, Edward A.; Moore, Kathryn J.] NYU, Sch Med, Marc & Ruti Bell Vasc Biol & Dis Program, Leon H Charney Div Cardiol,Dept Med, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Esau, Christine C.; Liu, Xueqing; Khatsenko, Oleg G.; Kaimal, Vivek] Regulus Therapeut, San Diego, CA 92121 USA; [McDaniel, Allison L.; Marshall, Stephanie M.; Temel, Ryan E.] Wake Forest Univ, Bowman Gray Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Sect Lipid Sci, Winston Salem, NC 27157 USA; [Lees, Cynthia J.] Wake Forest Univ, Bowman Gray Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Comparat Med Sect, Winston Salem, NC 27157 USA","Moore, KJ (reprint author), NYU, Sch Med, Marc & Ruti Bell Vasc Biol & Dis Program, Leon H Charney Div Cardiol,Dept Med, New York, NY 10016 USA.",rtemel@wfubmc.edu; kathryn.moore@nyumc.org,"Rayner, Katey/K-8914-2012; _, __/G-9472-2011","Sheedy, Frederick/0000-0003-2645-8493; Goedeke, Leigh/0000-0002-7690-1572; Rayner, Katey/0000-0001-6230-426X; van Gils, Janine/0000-0003-2429-7462; Fisher, Edward/0000-0001-9802-143X; Moore, kathryn/0000-0003-2505-2547","National Institutes of Health [R01AG02055, R01HL108182, P01HL098055, R01HL084312, R01HL58541, 1P30HL101270, R01HL107953, R00HL088528]; Canadian Institutes of Health Research","This work was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health to K.J.M.

About 50 per cent of cholesterol is eliminated from the body by its conversion into bile acids. However, bile acids released from the bile duct are constantly recycled, being reabsorbed in the intestine by the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT, also known as SLC10A2). It has been shown in animal models that plasma cholesterol levels are considerably lowered by specific inhibitors of ASBT(1,2), and ASBT is thus a target for hypercholesterolaemia drugs. Here we report the crystal structure of a bacterial homologue of ASBT from Neisseria meningitidis (ASBT(NM)) at 2.2 angstrom. ASBT(NM) contains two inverted structural repeats of five transmembrane helices. A core domain of six helices harbours two sodium ions, and the remaining four helices pack in a row to form a flat, 'panel'-like domain. Overall, the architecture of the protein is remarkably similar to the sodium/proton antiporter NhaA(3), despite having no detectable sequence homology. The ASBT(NM) structure was captured with the substrate taurocholate present, bound between the core and panel domains in a large, inward-facing, hydrophobic cavity. Residues near this cavity have been shown to affect the binding of specific inhibitors of human ASBT(4). The position of the taurocholate molecule, together with the molecular architecture, suggests the rudiments of a possible transport mechanism.","[Hu, Nien-Jen; Iwata, So; Cameron, Alexander D.; Drew, David] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Div Mol Biosci, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Hu, Nien-Jen; Iwata, So; Cameron, Alexander D.] Diamond Light Source, Membrane Prot Lab, Chilton OX11 0DE, England; [Hu, Nien-Jen; Iwata, So; Cameron, Alexander D.] Appleton Lab, Didcot OX11 0FA, Oxon, England; [Iwata, So; Cameron, Alexander D.] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, ERATO, Human Crystallog Project, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 606851, Japan; [Iwata, So] Kyoto Univ, Dept Cell Biol, Sch Med, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan","Drew, D (reprint author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Div Mol Biosci, London SW7 2AZ, England.",s.iwata@imperial.ac.uk; a.cameron@imperial.ac.uk; d.drew@imperial.ac.uk,"Cameron, Alexander/L-7288-2013","Cameron, Alexander/0000-0001-8776-3518","Medical Research Council [MRC_G0900990(91997)]; European Union [LSHG-CT-2004-504601]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/G023425/1]; MEXT, Japan; Japan Science and Technology Agency; Wellcome Trust [WT089809]","We are grateful to C.

Acid-loving thermophilic Archaea that live in the mudpots of volcanic solfataras obtain their energy from reduced sulphur compounds such as hydrogen sulphide (H2S) and carbon disulphide (CS2)(1,2). The oxidation of these compounds into sulphuric acid creates the extremely acidic environment that characterizes solfataras. The hyperthermophilic Acidianus strain A1-3, which was isolated from the fumarolic, ancient sauna building at the Solfatara volcano (Naples, Italy), was shown to rapidly convert CS2 into H2S and carbon dioxide (CO2), but nothing has been known about the modes of action and the evolution of the enzyme(s) involved. Here we describe the structure, the proposed mechanism and evolution of a CS2 hydrolase from Acidianus A1-3. The enzyme monomer displays a typical beta-carbonic anhydrase fold and active site, yet CO2 is not one of its substrates. Owing to large carboxy-and amino-terminal arms, an unusual hexadecameric catenane oligomer has evolved. This structure results in the blocking of the entrance to the active site that is found in canonical beta-carbonic anhydrases and the formation of a single 15-angstrom-long, highly hydrophobic tunnel that functions as a specificity filter. The tunnel determines the enzyme's substrate specificity for CS2, which is hydrophobic. The transposon sequences that surround the gene encoding this CS2 hydrolase point to horizontal gene transfer as a mechanism for its acquisition during evolution. Our results show how the ancient beta-carbonic anhydrase, which is central to global carbon metabolism, was transformed by divergent evolution into a crucial enzyme in CS2 metabolism.","[Smeulders, Marjan J.; Pol, Arjan; Zandvoort, Marcel H.; Khadem, Ahmad F.; Hermans, John; Russ, Lina; Jetten, Mike S.

But the identity of an endogenous ligand activating the AHR under physiological conditions in the absence of environmental toxic chemicals is still unknown. Here we identify the tryptophan (Trp) catabolite kynurenine (Kyn) as an endogenous ligand of the human AHR that is constitutively generated by human tumour cells via tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase (TDO), a liver-and neuron-derived Trp-degrading enzyme not yet implicated in cancer biology. TDO-derived Kyn suppresses antitumour immune responses and promotes tumour-cell survival and motility through the AHR in an autocrine/paracrine fashion. The TDO-AHR pathway is active in human brain tumours and is associated with malignant progression and poor survival. Because Kyn is produced during cancer progression and inflammation in the local microenvironment in amounts sufficient for activating the human AHR, these results provide evidence for a previously unidentified pathophysiological function of the AHR with profound implications for cancer and immune biology.","[Opitz, Christiane A.; Litzenburger, Ulrike M.; Ott, Martina; Schumacher, Theresa; Wick, Wolfgang; Platten, Michael] Univ Heidelberg Hosp, Neurol Clin, Dept Neurooncol, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Opitz, Christiane A.; Litzenburger, Ulrike M.; Ott, Martina; Schumacher, Theresa; Wick, Wolfgang; Platten, Michael] Univ Heidelberg Hosp, Natl Ctr Tumor Dis, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Opitz, Christiane A.; Litzenburger, Ulrike M.; Ott, Martina; Schumacher, Theresa; Platten, Michael] German Canc Res Ctr, Expt Neuroimmunol Unit, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Sahm, Felix; von Deimling, Andreas] Univ Heidelberg Hosp, Inst Pathol, Dept Neuropathol, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Sahm, Felix; von Deimling, Andreas] German Canc Res Ctr, Clin Cooperat Unit Neuropathol, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Tritschler, Isabel; Weller, Michael] Univ Zurich Hosp, Dept Neurol, CH-8091 Zurich, Switzerland; [Trump, Saskia; Lehmann, Irina] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Environm Immunol, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Jestaedt, Leonie] Univ Heidelberg Hosp, Dept Neuroradiol, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Schrenk, Dieter] Univ Kaiserslautern, D-67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany; [Jugold, Manfred] German Canc Res Ctr, Small Anim Imaging Ctr, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Guillemin, Gilles J.] Univ New S Wales, Sch Med Sci, Dept Pharmacol, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Miller, Christine L.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Pediat, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA; [Lutz, Christian] Heidelberg Pharma AG, D-68526 Ladenburg, Germany; [Radlwimmer, Bernhard] German Canc Res Ctr, Div Mol Genet, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Wick, Wolfgang] German Canc Res Ctr, Clin Cooperat Unit Neurooncol, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany","Platten, M (reprint author), Univ Heidelberg Hosp, Neurol Clin, Dept Neurooncol, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.",m.platten@dkfz-heidelberg.de,"Opitz, Christiane/I-9507-2012; Platten, Michael/F-2902-2013; von Deimling, Andreas/F-7774-2013; Radlwimmer, Bernhard/I-3229-2013","Opitz, Christiane/0000-0001-5575-9821; von Deimling, Andreas/0000-0002-5863-540X; Radlwimmer, Bernhard/0000-0002-4553-7800; Platten, Michael/0000-0002-4746-887X; Guillemin, Gilles/0000-0001-8105-4470",Helmholtz Association [VH-NG-306]; German Research Foundation [SFB 938 TP K]; Hertie Foundation; Helmholtz Alliance on Systems Biology; DKFZ PhD Program stipend; Heidelberg University Medical Faculty,"We thank K.

Reported fluorescence nanoscopy variants switch these features either with intense beams at defined positions or randomly, molecule by molecule. Here we demonstrate an optical nanoscopy that records raw data images from living cells and tissues with low levels of light. This advance has been facilitated by the generation of reversibly switchable enhanced green fluorescent protein (rsEGFP), a fluorescent protein that can be reversibly photoswitched more than a thousand times. Distributions of functional rsEGFP-fusion proteins in living bacteria and mammalian cells are imaged at <40-nanometre resolution. Dendritic spines in living brain slices are super-resolved with about a million times lower light intensities than before.

In addition to dedicated duplex-DNA-binding domains, cellular initiators possess AAA+ (ATPases associated with various cellular activities) elements that drive functions ranging from protein assembly to origin recognition. In bacteria, the AAA+ domain of the initiator DnaA has been proposed to assist in single-stranded DNA formation during origin melting. Here we show crystallographically and in solution that the ATP-dependent assembly of Aquifex aeolicus DnaA into a spiral oligomer creates a continuous surface that allows successive AAA+ domains to bind and extend single-stranded DNA segments. The mechanism of binding is unexpectedly similar to that of RecA, a homologous recombination factor, but it differs in that DnaA promotes a nucleic acid conformation that prevents pairing of a complementary strand. These findings, combined with strand-displacement assays, indicate that DnaA opens replication origins by a direct ATP-dependent stretching mechanism. Comparative studies reveal notable commonalities between the approach used by DnaA to engage DNA substrates and other, nucleic-acid-dependent, AAA+ systems.","[Duderstadt, Karl E.; Berger, James M.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Biophys Grad Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Chuang, Kevin; Berger, James M.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Calif Inst Quantitat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Berger, JM (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Biophys Grad Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",jmberger@berkeley.edu,,"Duderstadt, Karl/0000-0002-1279-7841",NIGMS [GM071747]; National Institute of Health [T32 GM008295],"We would like to thank K.

Turbulence in the interstellar medium produces a global cascade of random gas motions, spanning scales ranging from 100 parsecs to 1,000 kilometres (ref. 4). Fundamental parameters of interstellar turbulence such as the sonic Mach number (the speed of sound) have been difficult to determine, because observations have lacked the sensitivity and resolution to image the small-scale structure associated with turbulent motion(5-7). Observations of linear polarization and Faraday rotation in radio emission from the Milky Way have identified unusual polarized structures that often have no counterparts in the total radiation intensity or at other wavelengths(8-12), and whose physical significance has been unclear(13-15). Here we report that the gradient of the Stokes vector (Q, U), where Q and U are parameters describing the polarization state of radiation, provides an image of magnetized turbulence in diffuse, ionized gas, manifested as a complex filamentary web of discontinuities in gas density and magnetic field. Through comparison with simulations, we demonstrate that turbulence in the warm, ionized medium has a relatively low sonic Mach number, M-s less than or similar to 2. The development of statistical tools for the analysis of polarization gradients will allow accurate determinations of the Mach number, Reynolds number and magnetic field strength in interstellar turbulence over a wide range of conditions.","[Gaensler, B.

The similarity of Earth's bulk composition to that of meteorites known as enstatite chondrites(1) suggests a dry proto-Earth(2) with subsequent delivery of volatiles(3) by local accretion(4) or impacts of asteroids or comets(5,6). Previous measurements in six comets from the Oort cloud yielded a mean D/H ratio of (2.96 +/- 0.25) x 10(-4). The D/H value in carbonaceous chondrites, (1.4 +/- 0.1) x 10(-4), together with dynamical simulations, led to models in which asteroids were the main source of Earth's water(7), with <= 10 per cent being delivered by comets. Here we report that the D/H ratio in the Jupiter-family comet 103P/Hartley 2, which originated in the Kuiper belt, is (1.61 +/- 0.24) x 10(-4).

Many foundational experiments have been performed(2-8), and superconducting qubits are now considered one of the most promising systems for quantum information processing. However, the experimentally reported coherence times are likely to be insufficient for future large-scale quantum computation. A natural solution to this problem is a dedicated engineered quantum memory based on atomic and molecular systems. The question of whether coherent quantum coupling is possible between such natural systems and a single macroscopic artificial atom has attracted considerable attention(9-12) since the first demonstration of macroscopic quantum coherence in Josephson junction circuits(2). Here we report evidence of coherent strong coupling between a single macroscopic superconducting artificial atom (a flux qubit) and an ensemble of electron spins in the form of nitrogen-vacancy colour centres in diamond. Furthermore, we have observed coherent exchange of a single quantum of energy between a flux qubit and a macroscopic ensemble consisting of about 3 x 10(7) such colour centres. This provides a foundation for future quantum memories and hybrid devices coupling microwave and optical systems.","[Zhu, Xiaobo; Saito, Shiro; Kemp, Alexander; Kakuyanagi, Kosuke; Karimoto, Shin-ichi; Nakano, Hayato; Munro, William J.; Tokura, Yasuhiro; Kasu, Makoto; Semba, Kouichi] NTT Corp, NTT Basic Res Labs, Kanagawa 2430198, Japan; [Everitt, Mark S.; Nemoto, Kae] Res Org Informat & Syst, Natl Inst Informat, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1018430, Japan; [Mizuochi, Norikazu] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Engn Sci, Osaka 5608531, Japan; [Mizuochi, Norikazu] PRESTO JST, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan","Semba, K (reprint author), NTT Corp, NTT Basic Res Labs, 3-1 Morinosato Wakamiya, Kanagawa 2430198, Japan.",semba.kouichi@lab.ntt.co.jp,"Munro, William/A-8453-2011; Semba, Kouichi/B-3638-2016; Tokura, Yasuhiro/A-5550-2011; Nemoto, Kae/A-8833-2011; MIZUOCHI, Norikazu/I-4199-2014","Munro, William/0000-0003-1835-2250; Tokura, Yasuhiro/0000-0001-6656-4237; Mizuochi, Norikazu/0000-0003-3099-3210; Everitt, Mark/0000-0003-2142-4438; ","Funding Program for World-Leading Innovative R&D on Science and Technology (FIRST); MEXT [18001002]; Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) [22102502, 22241025]","We thank T.

In living cells the process is mediated by enzymes and occurs autonomously, with the number of replicas increasing exponentially over time without the need for external manipulation. Self-replication has also been implemented with synthetic systems, including RNA enzymes designed to undergo self-sustained exponential amplification(1-5). An exciting next step would be to use self-replication in materials fabrication, which requires robust and general systems capable of copying and amplifying functional materials or structures. Here we report a first development in this direction, using DNA tile motifs that can recognize and bind complementary tiles in a pre-programmed fashion. We first design tile motifs so they form a seven-tile seed sequence; then use the seeds to instruct the formation of a first generation of complementary seven-tile daughter sequences; and finally use the daughters to instruct the formation of seven-tile granddaughter sequences that are identical to the initial seed sequences.

This oxygenation has been linked to the emergence of oxygenic cyanobacteria(1,2) and to changes in the compositions of volcanic gases(3,4), but not to the composition of erupting lavas-geochemical constraints indicate that the oxidation state of basalts and their mantle sources has remained constant since 3.5 billion years ago(5,6). Here we propose that a decrease in the average pressure of volcanic degassing changed the oxidation state of sulphur in volcanic gases, initiating the modern biogeochemical sulphur cycle and triggering atmospheric oxygenation. Using thermodynamic calculations simulating gas-melt equilibria in erupting magmas, we suggest that mostly submarine Archaean volcanoes produced gases with SO(2)/H(2)S < 1 and low sulphur content. Emergence of the continents due to a global decrease in sea level and growth of the continental crust in the late Archaean then led to widespread subaerial volcanism, which in turn yielded gases much richer in sulphur and dominated by SO(2). Dissolution of sulphur in sea water and the onset of sulphate reduction processes could then oxidize the atmosphere.","[Gaillard, Fabrice; Scaillet, Bruno] Univ Tours, Univ Orleans, CNRS INSU, Inst Sci Terre Orleans, F-45071 Orleans 2, France; [Arndt, Nicholas T.] Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, ISTerre, F-38400 St Martin Dheres, France","Gaillard, F (reprint author), Univ Tours, Univ Orleans, CNRS INSU, Inst Sci Terre Orleans, 1A Rue Ferollerie, F-45071 Orleans 2, France.",gaillard@cnrs-orleans.fr,"Scaillet, Bruno/A-5846-2012; Gaillard, Fabrice/H-1308-2012","Gaillard, Fabrice/0000-0001-8079-0476; Gaillard, Fabrice/0000-0002-4443-8253","INSU-PNP; ANR [ANR-10-BLAN-60301, ANR-10-BLAN-62101]","We thank T.

However, it is not known whether this benefit is received by each participant node in proportion to its overall contribution to network persistence. This issue is critical to understanding the trade-offs faced by individual nodes in a network(3-5). We address this question by applying a suite of structural and dynamic methods to an ensemble of flowering plant/insect pollinator networks. Here we report two main results. First, nodes contribute heterogeneously to the overall nested architecture of the network. From simulations, we confirm that the removal of a strong contributor tends to decrease overall network persistence more than the removal of a weak contributor. Second, strong contributors to collective persistence do not gain individual survival benefits but are in fact the nodes most vulnerable to extinction. We explore the generality of these results to other cooperative networks by analysing a 15-year time series of the interactions between designer and contractor firms in the New York City garment industry. As with the ecological networks, a firm's survival probability decreases as its individual nestedness contribution increases. Our results, therefore, introduce a new paradox into the study of the persistence of cooperative networks, and potentially address questions about the impact of invasive species in ecological systems and new competitors in economic systems.","[Stouffer, Daniel B.; Bascompte, Jordi] CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Integrat Ecol Grp, E-41092 Seville, Spain; [Saavedra, Serguei; Uzzi, Brian] Northwestern Univ, NW Inst Complex Syst, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Saavedra, Serguei; Uzzi, Brian] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Saavedra, Serguei] Northwestern Univ, Clin & Translat Sci Inst, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Stouffer, Daniel B.] Univ Canterbury, Sch Biol Sci, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand","Bascompte, J (reprint author), CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Integrat Ecol Grp, Calle Americo Vespucio S-N, E-41092 Seville, Spain.",bascompte@ebd.csic.es,"Stouffer, Daniel/C-2223-2008; CSIC, EBD Donana/C-4157-2011; Bascompte, Jordi/B-7596-2008","Stouffer, Daniel/0000-0001-9436-9674; CSIC, EBD Donana/0000-0003-4318-6602; Bascompte, Jordi/0000-0002-0108-6411","Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University; Northwestern University Institute on Complex Systems; NUCATS [UL1RR025741]; CSIC-JAE postdoctoral fellowship; Army Research Laboratory [W911NF-09-2-0053]; European Research Council under the European Community [268543]","Funding was provided by the Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University, the Northwestern University Institute on Complex Systems (NICO; to S.

Male Drosophila melanogaster fruitflies display stereotyped reproductive behaviours towards females, and these behaviours are controlled by the neural circuitry expressing male-specific isoforms of the transcription factor Fruitless (FRUM)(2-5). However, the volatile pheromone ligands, receptors and olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) that promote male courtship have not been identified in this important model organism. Here we describe a novel courtship function of Ionotropic receptor 84a (IR84a), which is a member of the chemosensory ionotropic glutamate receptor family(6), in a previously uncharacterized population of FRUM-positive OSNs. IR84a-expressing neurons are activated not by fly-derived chemicals but by the aromatic odours phenylacetic acid and phenylacetaldehyde, which are widely found in fruit and other plant tissues(7) that serve as food sources and oviposition sites for drosophilid flies(8). Mutation of Ir84a abolishes both odour-evoked and spontaneous electrophysiological activity in these neurons and markedly reduces male courtship behaviour. Conversely, male courtship is increased-in an IR84a-dependent manner-in the presence of phenylacetic acid but not in the presence of another fruit odour that does not activate IR84a. Interneurons downstream of IR84a-expressing OSNs innervate a pheromone-processing centre in the brain. Whereas IR84a orthologues and phenylacetic-acid-responsive neurons are present in diverse drosophilid species, IR84a is absent from insects that rely on long-range sex pheromones. Our results suggest a model in which IR84a couples food presence to the activation of the fru(M) courtship circuitry in fruitflies. These findings reveal an unusual but effective evolutionary solution to coordinate feeding and oviposition site selection with reproductive behaviours through a specific sensory pathway.","[Grosjean, Yael; Rytz, Raphael; Abuin, Liliane; Benton, Richard] Univ Lausanne, Fac Biol & Med, Ctr Integrat Genom, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Grosjean, Yael; Farine, Jean-Pierre; Cortot, Jerome] Univ Bourgogne, INRA, UMR 1324, Ctr Sci Gout & Alimentat,CNRS,UMR 6265, F-21000 Dijon, France; [Jefferis, Gregory S.

More than 250 putative pheromone receptors have been identified in the mouse VNO(2,3), but the nature of the signals detected by individual VNO receptors has not yet been elucidated. To gain insight into the molecular logic of VNO detection leading to mating, aggression or defensive responses, we sought to uncover the response profiles of individual vomeronasal receptors to a wide range of animal cues. Here we describe the repertoire of behaviourally and physiologically relevant stimuli detected by a large number of individual vomeronasal receptors in mice, and define a global map of vomeronasal signal detection. We demonstrate that the two classes (V1R and V2R) of vomeronasal receptors use fundamentally different strategies to encode chemosensory information, and that distinct receptor subfamilies have evolved towards the specific recognition of certain animal groups or chemical structures. The association of large subsets of vomeronasal receptors with cognate, ethologically and physiologically relevant stimuli establishes the molecular foundation of vomeronasal information coding, and opens new avenues for further investigating the neural mechanisms underlying behaviour specificity.","[Isogai, Yoh; Dulac, Catherine] Harvard Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Ctr Brain Sci, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Dulac, C (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Ctr Brain Sci, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",dulac@fas.harvard.edu,,,NIDCD at the National Institute of Health; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation [DRG-1981-08],"We acknowledge H.

In such networks, representations can be reactivated reliably from subsets of the cues that were present when the memory was encoded, at the same time as interference from competing representations is minimized. Theoretical studies have pointed to the recurrent CA3 system of the hippocampus as a possible attractor network(3,4). Consistent with predictions from these studies, experiments have shown that place representations in CA3 and downstream CA1 tolerate small changes in the configuration of the environment but switch to uncorrelated representations when dissimilarities become larger(5-9). However, the kinetics supporting such network transitions, at the subsecond timescale, is poorly understood. Here we show in rats that instantaneous transformation of the spatial context does not change the hippocampal representation all at once but is followed by temporary bistability in the discharge activity of CA3 ensembles. Rather than sliding through a continuum of intermediate activity states, the CA3 network undergoes a short period of competitive flickering between preformed representations of the past and present environment before settling on the latter. Network flickers are extremely fast, often with complete replacement of the active ensemble from one theta cycle to the next. Within individual cycles, segregation is stronger towards the end, when firing starts to decline, pointing to the theta cycle as a temporal unit for expression of attractor states in the hippocampus. Repetition of pattern-completion processes across successive theta cycles may facilitate error correction and enhance discriminative power in the presence of weak and ambiguous input cues.","[Jezek, Karel; Henriksen, Espen J.; Treves, Alessandro; Moser, Edvard I.; Moser, May-Britt] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Kavli Inst Syst Neurosci, MTFS, N-7489 Trondheim, Norway; [Jezek, Karel; Henriksen, Espen J.; Treves, Alessandro; Moser, Edvard I.; Moser, May-Britt] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Ctr Biol Memory, MTFS, N-7489 Trondheim, Norway; [Jezek, Karel] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Inst Physiol, Dept Physiol Memory, CR-14220 Prague 4, Krc, Czech Republic; [Treves, Alessandro] SISSA Int Sch Adv Studies, Cognit Neurosci Sect, I-34136 Trieste, Italy","Jezek, K (reprint author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Kavli Inst Syst Neurosci, MTFS, Olav Kyrres Gate 9, N-7489 Trondheim, Norway.",karel.jezek@biomed.cas.cz; edvard.moser@ntnu.no,"Jezek, Karel/A-9581-2012","TREVES, Alessandro/0000-0001-7246-5673","European Commission [200873]; European Research Council ('ENSEMBLE'); Kavli Foundation; Norwegian Research Council; Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic [MSMT CR LC554, 1M0517, AV0Z50110509]","We thank R.

However, it is unknown whether T cells are also educated to be tolerant of foreign antigens, such as those from commensal bacteria, to prevent immunopathology such as inflammatory bowel disease(2-4). Here we show that encounter with commensal microbiota results in the peripheral generation of T(reg) cells rather than pathogenic effectors. We observed that colonic T(reg) cells used T-cell antigen receptors (TCRs) different from those used by T(reg) cells in other locations, implying an important role for local antigens in shaping the colonic T(reg)-cell population. Many of the local antigens seemed to be derived from commensal bacteria, on the basis of the in vitro reactivity of common colon T(reg) TCRs. These TCRs did not facilitate thymic T(reg)-cell development, implying that many colonic T(reg) cells arise instead by means of antigen-driven peripheral T(reg)-cell development. Further analysis of two of these TCRs by the creation of retroviral bone marrow chimaeras and a TCR transgenic line revealed that microbiota indigenous to our mouse colony was required for the generation of colonic T(reg) cells from otherwise naive T cells. If T cells expressing these TCRs fail to undergo T(reg)-cell development and instead become effector cells, they have the potential to induce colitis, as evidenced by adoptive transfer studies. These results suggest that the efficient peripheral generation of antigen-specific populations of T(reg) cells in response to an individual's microbiota provides important post-thymic education of the immune system to foreign antigens, thereby providing tolerance to commensal microbiota.","[Lathrop, Stephanie K.; Rao, Sindhuja M.; Nutsch, Katherine; Lio, Chan-Wang; Santacruz, Nicole; Hsieh, Chyi-Song] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Rheumatol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Bloom, Seth M.; Stappenbeck, Thaddeus S.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Immunol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Peterson, Daniel A.] Univ Nebraska, Dept Food Sci & Technol, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA","Hsieh, CS (reprint author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Rheumatol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.",chsieh@wustl.edu,,"Hsieh, Chyi-Song/0000-0001-5976-9250",National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; Burroughs-Wellcome Fund; National Institutes of Health [5T32AI0071632],"We thank K.

Genetic inducible fate mapping studies have identified two principal epithelial stem cell pools in this tissue. One pool consists of columnar Lgr5-expressing cells that cycle rapidly and are present predominantly at the crypt base(1). The other pool consists of Bmi1-expressing cells that largely reside above the crypt base(2). However, the relative functions of these two pools and their interrelationship are not understood. Here we specifically ablated Lgr5-expressing cells in mice using a human diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) gene knocked into the Lgr5 locus. We found that complete loss of the Lgr5-expressing cells did not perturb homeostasis of the epithelium, indicating that other cell types can compensate for the elimination of this population. After ablation of Lgr5-expressing cells, progeny production by Bmi1-expressing cells increased, indicating that Bmi1-expressing stem cells compensate for the loss of Lgr5-expressing cells. Indeed, lineage tracing showed that Bmi1-expressing cells gave rise to Lgr5-expressing cells, pointing to a hierarchy of stem cells in the intestinal epithelium. Our results demonstrate that Lgr5-expressing cells are dispensable for normal intestinal homeostasis, and that in the absence of these cells, Bmi1-expressing cells can serve as an alternative stem cell pool. These data provide the first experimental evidence for the interrelationship between these populations. The Bmi1-expressing stem cells may represent both a reserve stem cell pool in case of injury to the small intestine epithelium and a source for replenishment of the Lgr5-expressing cells under non-pathological conditions.","[Tian, Hua; Warming, Soren; de Sauvage, Frederic J.] Genentech Inc, Dept Mol Biol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Biehs, Brian; Klein, Ophir D.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Inst Human Genet, Dept Orofacial Sci, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Biehs, Brian; Klein, Ophir D.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Inst Human Genet, Dept Pediat, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Biehs, Brian; Klein, Ophir D.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Program Craniofacial & Mesenchymal Biol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Leong, Kevin G.] Genentech Inc, Dept Res Oncol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Rangell, Linda] Genentech Inc, Dept Pathol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA","de Sauvage, FJ (reprint author), Genentech Inc, Dept Mol Biol, 1 DNA Way, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA.",ophir.klein@ucsf.edu; desauvage.fred@gene.com,,"Klein, Ophir/0000-0002-6254-7082",National Institutes of Health [1-DP2-OD007191];  [R01-DE021420],"We gratefully acknowledge efforts by all the members of the Genentech mouse facility, in particular R.

Defective responses to forces underlie human medical disorders(1-4) such as cardiac failure(5) and pulmonary injury(6). The actin cytoskeleton's connectivity enables it to transmit forces rapidly over large distances(7), implicating it in these physiological and pathological responses. Despite detailed knowledge of the cytoskeletal structure, the specific molecular switches that convert mechanical stimuli into chemical signals have remained elusive. Here we identify the actin-binding protein filamin A (FLNA)(8,9) as a central mechanotransduction element of the cytoskeleton. We reconstituted a minimal system consisting of actin filaments, FLNA and two FLNA-binding partners: the cytoplasmic tail of beta-integrin, and FilGAP. Integrins form an essential mechanical linkage between extracellular and intracellular environments, with beta-integrin tails connecting to the actin cytoskeleton by binding directly to filamin(4). FilGAP is an FLNA-binding GTPase-activating protein specific for RAC, which in vivo regulates cell spreading and bleb formation(10). Using fluorescence loss after photoconversion, a novel, high-speed alternative to fluorescence recovery after photobleaching(11), we demonstrate that both externally imposed bulk shear and myosin-II-driven forces differentially regulate the binding of these partners to FLNA. Consistent with structural predictions, strain increases beta-integrin binding to FLNA, whereas it causes FilGAP to dissociate from FLNA, providing a direct and specific molecular basis for cellular mechanotransduction. These results identify a molecular mechanotransduction element within the actin cytoskeleton, revealing that mechanical strain of key proteins regulates the binding of signalling molecules.","[Ehrlicher, A.

In plants, attempted microbial infection triggers the rapid synthesis of nitric oxide(3,4) and a parallel accumulation of reactive oxygen intermediates, the latter generated by NADPH oxidases related to those responsible for the pathogen-activated respiratory burst in phagocytes(5). Both nitric oxide and reactive oxygen intermediates have been implicated in controlling the hypersensitive response, a programmed execution of plant cells at sites of attempted infection(3,5,6). However, the molecular mechanisms that underpin their function and coordinate their synthesis are unknown. Here we show genetic evidence that increases in cysteine thiols modified using nitric oxide, termed S-nitrosothiols, facilitate the hypersensitive response in the absence of the cell death agonist salicylic acid and the synthesis of reactive oxygen intermediates. Surprisingly, when concentrations of S-nitrosothiols were high, nitric oxide function also governed a negative feedback loop limiting the hypersensitive response, mediated by S-nitrosylation of the NADPH oxidase, AtRBOHD, at Cys 890, abolishing its ability to synthesize reactive oxygen intermediates. Accordingly, mutation of Cys 890 compromised S-nitrosothiol-mediated control of AtRBOHD activity, perturbing the magnitude of cell death development. This cysteine is evolutionarily conserved and specifically S-nitrosylated in both human and fly NADPH oxidase, suggesting that this mechanism may govern immune responses in both plants and animals.","[Yun, Byung-Wook; Feechan, Angela; Yin, Minghui; Saidi, Noor B.

Whereas T7 RNAP can initiate transcription by itself, mtRNAP requires the factors TFAM and TFB2M for binding and melting promoter DNA(5-7). TFAM is an abundant protein that binds and bends promoter DNA 15-40 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site, and stimulates the recruitment of mtRNAP and TFB2M to the promoter(8,9). TFB2M assists mtRNAP in promoter melting and reaches the active site of mtRNAP to interact with the first base pair of the RNA-DNA hybrid(10). Here we report the X-ray structure of human mtRNAP at 2.5 angstrom resolution, which reveals a T7-like catalytic carboxy-terminal domain, an amino-terminal domain that remotely resembles the T7 promoter-binding domain, a novel pentatricopeptide repeat domain, and a flexible N-terminal extension. The pentatricopeptide repeat domain sequesters an AT-rich recognition loop, which binds promoter DNA in T7 RNAP, probably explaining the need for TFAM during promoter binding. Consistent with this, substitution of a conserved arginine residue in the AT-rich recognition loop, or release of this loop by deletion of the N-terminal part of mtRNAP, had no effect on transcription. The fingers domain and the intercalating hairpin, which melts DNA in phage RNAPs, are repositioned, explaining the need for TFB2M during promoter melting. Our results provide a new venue for the mechanistic analysis of mitochondrial transcription. They also indicate how an early phage-like mtRNAP lost functions in promoter binding and melting, which were provided by initiation factors in trans during evolution, to enable mitochondrial gene regulation and the adaptation of mitochondrial function to changes in the environment.","[Ringel, Rieke; Litonin, Dmitry; Cramer, Patrick] Univ Munich, Gene Ctr, D-81377 Munich, Germany; [Ringel, Rieke; Litonin, Dmitry; Cramer, Patrick] Univ Munich, Dept Biochem, CIPSM, D-81377 Munich, Germany; [Sologub, Marina; Morozov, Yaroslav I.; Litonin, Dmitry; Temiakov, Dmitry] Univ Med & Dent New Jersey, Sch Osteopath Med, Dept Cell Biol, Stratford, NJ 08084 USA","Cramer, P (reprint author), Univ Munich, Gene Ctr, Feodor Lynen Str 25, D-81377 Munich, Germany.",cramer@lmb.uni-muenchen.de; d.temiakov@umdnj.edu,,,"US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-AC02-06CH11357]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB646, TR5, FOR1068]; Nanosystems Initiative Munich NIM; European Research Council ERC; Jung-Stiftung; UMDNJ Foundation [PC25-11]","We thank A.

This has been amply documented for early-onset cognitive impairment, or intellectual disability, one of the most complex disorders known and a very important health care problem worldwide. More than 90 different gene defects have been identified for X-chromosome-linked intellectual disability alone, but research into the more frequent autosomal forms of intellectual disability is still in its infancy. To expedite the molecular elucidation of autosomal-recessive intellectual disability, we have now performed homozygosity mapping, exon enrichment and next-generation sequencing in 136 consanguineous families with autosomal-recessive intellectual disability from Iran and elsewhere. This study, the largest published so far, has revealed additional mutations in 23 genes previously implicated in intellectual disability or related neurological disorders, as well as single, probably disease-causing variants in 50 novel candidate genes. Proteins encoded by several of these genes interact directly with products of known intellectual disability genes, and many are involved in fundamental cellular processes such as transcription and translation, cell-cycle control, energy metabolism and fatty-acid synthesis, which seem to be pivotal for normal brain development and function.","[Hu, Hao; Garshasbi, Masoud; Chen, Wei; Zecha, Agnes; Puettmann, Lucia; Jensen, Corinna; Moheb, Lia Abbasi; Bienek, Melanie; Mueller, Ines; Weissmann, Robert; Wrogemann, Klaus; Lipkowitz, Bettina; Esmaeeli-Nieh, Sahar; Hoffer, Julia; Musante, Luciana; Kalscheuer, Vera; Ullmann, Reinhard; Kuss, Andreas Walter; Tzschach, Andreas; Ropers, H.

Here we report whole-exome sequencing of 29 myelodysplasia specimens, which unexpectedly revealed novel pathway mutations involving multiple components of the RNA splicing machinery, including U2AF35, ZRSR2, SRSF2 and SF3B1. In a large series analysis, these splicing pathway mutations were frequent (similar to 45 to similar to 85%) in, and highly specific to, myeloid neoplasms showing features of myelodysplasia. Conspicuously, most of the mutations, which occurred in a mutually exclusive manner, affected genes involved in the 3'-splice site recognition during pre-mRNA processing, inducing abnormal RNA splicing and compromised haematopoiesis. Our results provide the first evidence indicating that genetic alterations of the major splicing components could be involved inhuman pathogenesis, also implicating a novel therapeutic possibility for myelodysplasia.","[Yoshida, Kenichi; Sanada, Masashi; Nagata, Yasunobu; Sato, Yusuke; Sato-Otsubo, Aiko; Kon, Ayana; Shiosaka, Masashi; Kawahata, Ryoichiro; Ogawa, Seishi] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Med, Canc Genom Project, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138655, Japan; [Shiraishi, Yuichi; Miyano, Satoru] Univ Tokyo, Inst Med Sci, Ctr Human Genome, Lab DNA Informat Anal,Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; [Nowak, Daniel; Nolte, Florian; Hofmann, Wolf-Karsten] Univ Heidelberg, Dept Hematol & Oncol, Med Fac Manheim, D-68167 Mannheim, Germany; [Yamamoto, Ryo; Otsu, Makoto; Nakauchi, Hiromitsu] Univ Tokyo, Div Stem Cell Therapy, Ctr Stem Cell Biol & Regenerat Med, Inst Med Sci,Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; [Nagasaki, Masao] Univ Tokyo, Lab Funct Genom, Ctr Human Genome, Inst Med Sci,Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; [Chalkidis, George; Miyano, Satoru] Univ Tokyo, Lab Sequence Data Anal, Ctr Human Genome, Inst Med Sci,Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; [Suzuki, Yutaka; Sugano, Sumio] Univ Tokyo, Div Syst Biomed Technol, Inst Med Sci, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; [Yamaguchi, Tomoyuki; Nakauchi, Hiromitsu] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, Nakauchi Stem Cell & Organ Regenerat Project, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; [Obara, Naoshi; Sakata-Yanagimoto, Mamiko; Chiba, Shigeru] Univ Tsukuba, Dept Hematol, Inst Clin Med, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058571, Japan; [Ishiyama, Ken; Miyawaki, Shuichi] Tokyo Metropolitan Otsuka Hosp, Div Hematol, Toshima Ku, Tokyo 1700005, Japan; [Mori, Hiraku] Showa Univ, Fujigaoka Hosp, Div Hematol, Aoba Ku, Kanagawa 2278501, Japan; [Haferlach, Claudia; Haferlach, Torsten] Munich Leukemia Lab, D-81377 Munich, Germany; [Koeffler, H.

Such cells, carrying the patient's genome, might be useful for cell replacement. Here we report that the development of human oocytes after genome exchange arrests at late cleavage stages in association with transcriptional abnormalities. In contrast, if the oocyte genome is not removed and the somatic cell genome is merely added, the resultant triploid cells develop to the blastocyst stage. Stem cell lines derived from these blastocysts differentiate into cell types of all three germ layers, and a pluripotent gene expression program is established on the genome derived from the somatic cell. This result demonstrates the feasibility of reprogramming human cells using oocytes and identifies removal of the oocyte genome as the primary cause of developmental failure after genome exchange.","[Noggle, Scott; Martinez, Hector; Paull, Daniel; Druckenmiller, Sarah; Egli, Dieter] New York Stem Cell Fdn Lab, New York, NY USA; [Fung, Ho-Lim; Gore, Athurva; Zhang, Kun] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Bioengn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Satriani, Kathleen Crumm; Prosser, Robert; Oum, Kiboong; Sauer, Mark V.] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Ctr Womens Reprod Care, New York, NY USA; [Satriani, Kathleen Crumm; Prosser, Robert; Oum, Kiboong; Sauer, Mark V.] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, New York, NY USA; [Freeby, Matthew; Greenberg, Ellen; Goland, Robin; Leibel, Rudolph L.] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Naomi Berrie Diabet Ctr, New York, NY USA; [Freeby, Matthew; Greenberg, Ellen; Goland, Robin; Leibel, Rudolph L.] Columbia Univ, Dept Pediat, Coll Phys & Surg, New York, NY 10027 USA","Egli, D (reprint author), New York Stem Cell Fdn Lab, New York, NY USA.",d.egli@nyscf.org,"Egli, Dieter/C-3566-2013",,UCSD; New York Stem Cell Foundation; Russell Berrie Foundation,"We thank our research subjects for participating.

AMD is the leading cause of blindness in Western societies, but its aetiology remains largely unknown. Malondialdehyde (MDA) is a common lipid peroxidation product that accumulates in many pathophysiological processes, including AMD. Here we identify complement factor H (CFH) as a major MDA-binding protein that can block both the uptake of MDA-modified proteins by macrophages and MDA-induced proinflammatory effects in vivo in mice. The CFH polymorphism H402, which is strongly associated with AMD, markedly reduces the ability of CFH to bind MDA, indicating a causal link to disease aetiology. Our findings provide important mechanistic insights into innate immune responses to oxidative stress, which may be exploited in the prevention of and therapy for AMD and other chronic inflammatory diseases.","[Weismann, David; Hartvigsen, Karsten; Bennett, Keiryn L.; Superti-Furga, Giulio; Binder, Christoph J.] Austrian Acad Sci, CeMM, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Weismann, David; Hartvigsen, Karsten; Brandstaetter, Hubert; Binder, Christoph J.] Med Univ Vienna, Dept Lab Med, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Hartvigsen, Karsten; Tsimikas, Sotirios; Witztum, Joseph L.; Binder, Christoph J.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Lauer, Nadine; Skerka, Christine; Zipfel, Peter F.] Hans Knoell Inst, Leibniz Inst Nat Prod Res & Infect Biol, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Lauer, Nadine; Skerka, Christine; Zipfel, Peter F.] Univ Jena, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Scholl, Hendrik P.

They can also launch subrelativistic and mildly relativistic outflows(4-8) and are often assumed to be the sources of short gamma-ray bursts(9). An electromagnetic signature that persisted for weeks to months after the event would strengthen any future claim of a detection of gravitational waves(10). Here we present results of calculations showing that the interaction of mildly relativistic outflows with the surrounding medium produces radio flares with peak emission at 1.4 gigahertz that persist at detectable (submillijansky) levels for weeks, out to a redshift of 0.1. Slower subrelativistic outflows produce flares detectable for years at 150 megahertz, as well as at 1.4 gigahertz, from slightly shorter distances. The radio transient RT 19870422 (ref. 11) has the properties predicted by our model, and its most probable origin is the merger of a compact neutron-star/neutron-star binary. The lack of radio detections usually associated with short gamma-ray bursts does not constrain the radio transients that we discuss here (from mildly relativistic and subrelativistic outflows) because short gamma-ray burst redshifts are typically >0.1 and the appropriate timescales (longer than weeks) have not been sampled.","[Piran, Tsvi] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Racah Inst Phys, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel; [Nakar, Ehud] Tel Aviv Univ, Raymond & Beverly Sackler Sch Phys & Astron, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel","Piran, T (reprint author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Racah Inst Phys, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel.",udini@wise.tau.ac.il; tsvi@phys.huji.ac.il,,,ERC; Israeli Center for Excellence for High Energy Astrophysics; ISF [174/08]; IRG grant,"We thank D.

Essentially, two counteracting forces govern the motion of the Brownian particle. First, the particle is driven by rapid collisions with the surrounding solvent molecules, referred to as thermal noise. Second, the friction between the particle and the viscous solvent damps its motion. Conventionally, the thermal force is assumed to be random and characterized by a Gaussian white noise spectrum. The friction is assumed to be given by the Stokes drag, suggesting that motion is overdamped at long times in particle tracking experiments, when inertia becomes negligible. However, as the particle receives momentum from the fluctuating fluid molecules, it also displaces the fluid in its immediate vicinity. The entrained fluid acts back on the particle and gives rise to long-range correlations(5,6). This hydrodynamic 'memory' translates to thermal forces, which have a coloured, that is, non-white, noise spectrum. One hundred years after Perrin's pioneering experiments on Brownian motion(7-9), direct experimental observation of this colour is still elusive(10). Here we measure the spectrum of thermal noise by confining the Brownian fluctuations of a microsphere in a strong optical trap. We show that hydrodynamic correlations result in a resonant peak in the power spectral density of the sphere's positional fluctuations, in strong contrast to overdamped systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate different strategies to achieve peak amplification. By analogy with microcantilever-based sensors(11,12), our results reveal that the particle-fluid-trap system can be considered a nanomechanical resonator in which the intrinsic hydrodynamic backflow enhances resonance. Therefore, instead of being treated as a disturbance, details in thermal noise could be exploited for the development of new types of sensor and particle-based assay in lab-on-a-chip applications(13,14).","[Grimm, Matthias; Jeney, Sylvia] Univ Basel, Biozentrum, ME Muller Inst Struct Biol, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; [Franosch, Thomas] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Inst Theoret Phys, D-91058 Erlangen, Germany; [Grimm, Matthias; Mor, Flavio M.; Forro, Laszlo; Jeney, Sylvia] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lab Phys Complex Matter, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Belushkin, Maxim; Foffi, Giuseppe] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Inst Theoret Phys, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","Jeney, S (reprint author), Univ Basel, Biozentrum, ME Muller Inst Struct Biol, Klingelbergstr 70, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland.",sylvia.jeney@epfl.ch,"Foffi, Giuseppe/C-3923-2009","Foffi, Giuseppe/0000-0002-7444-1453","Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [200021-113529, 206021-121396]; NCCR Nanoscale Science; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD); National Competence Center in Biomedical Imaging (NCCBI); SNF [PP0022_119006]","S.J. acknowledges the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF; grant nos 200021-113529 and 206021-121396).

On the one hand, a classical oscillator has a well-defined amplitude of motion; a quantum oscillator, on the other hand, has a lowest-energy state, or ground state, with a finite-amplitude uncertainty corresponding to zero-point motion. On the macroscopic scale of our everyday experience, owing to interactions with its highly fluctuating thermal environment a mechanical oscillator is filled with many energy quanta and its quantum nature is all but hidden. Recently, in experiments performed at temperatures of a few hundredths of a kelvin, engineered nanomechanical resonators coupled to electrical circuits have been measured to be oscillating in their quantum ground state(3,4). These experiments, in addition to providing a glimpse into the underlying quantum behaviour of mesoscopic systems consisting of billions of atoms, represent the initial steps towards the use of mechanical devices as tools for quantum metrology(5,6) or as a means of coupling hybrid quantum systems(7-9). Here we report the development of a coupled, nanoscale optical and mechanical resonator(10) formed in a silicon microchip, in which radiation pressure from a laser is used to cool the mechanical motion down to its quantum ground state (reaching an average phonon occupancy number of 0.85 +/- 0.08). This cooling is realized at an environmental temperature of 20 K, roughly one thousand times larger than in previous experiments and paves the way for optical control of mesoscale mechanical oscillators in the quantum regime.","[Chan, Jasper; Mayer Alegre, T.

In a hard-snowball picture, the subsequent rapid unfreezing resulted from an ultra-greenhouse event attributed to the buildup of volcanic carbon dioxide (CO(2)) during glaciation(1). High partial pressures of atmospheric CO(2) (p(CO2); from 20,000 to 90,000 p. p. m. v.) in the aftermath of the Marinoan glaciation (similar to 635 Myr ago) have been inferred from both boron and triple oxygen isotopes(2,3). These p(CO2) values are 50 to 225 times higher than present-day levels. Here, we re-evaluate these estimates using paired carbon isotopic data for carbonate layers that cap Neoproterozoic glacial deposits and are considered to record post-glacial sea level rise(1). The new data reported here for Brazilian cap carbonates, together with previous ones for time-equivalent units(4-8), provide p(CO2) estimates lower than 3,200 p. p. m. v.-and possibly as low as the current value of similar to 400 p. p. m. v. Our new constraint, and our reinterpretation of the boron and triple oxygen isotope data, provide a completely different picture of the late Neoproterozoic environment, with low atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and oxygen that are inconsistent with a hard-snowball Earth.","[Sansjofre, P.; Ader, M.; Cartigny, P.] Univ Paris Diderot, Equipe Geochim Isotopes Stables, Inst Phys Globe Paris, UMR CNRS 7154, F-75238 Paris 05, France; [Sansjofre, P.; Trindade, R.

Underweight, defined as a body mass index (BMI) <= 18.5 kg per m(2) in adults and <= -2 standard deviations from the mean in children, is the main sign of a series of heterogeneous clinical conditions including failure to thrive(3-5), feeding and eating disorder and/or anorexia nervosa(6,7). In contrast to obesity, few genetic variants underlying these clinical conditions have been reported(8,9). We previously showed that hemizygosity of a similar to 600-kilobase (kb) region on the short arm of chromosome 16 causes a highly penetrant form of obesity that is often associated with hyperphagia and intellectual disabilities(10). Here we show that the corresponding reciprocal duplication is associated with being underweight. We identified 138 duplication carriers (including 132 novel cases and 108 unrelated carriers) from individuals clinically referred for developmental or intellectual disabilities (DD/ID) or psychiatric disorders, or recruited from population-based cohorts. These carriers show significantly reduced postnatal weight and BMI. Half of the boys younger than five years are underweight with a probable diagnosis of failure to thrive, whereas adult duplication carriers have an 8.3-fold increased risk of being clinically underweight. We observe a trend towards increased severity in males, as well as a depletion of male carriers among non-medically ascertained cases. These features are associated with an unusually high frequency of selective and restrictive eating behaviours and a significant reduction in head circumference. Each of the observed phenotypes is the converse of one reported in carriers of deletions at this locus. The phenotypes correlate with changes in transcript levels for genes mapping within the duplication but not in flanking regions. The reciprocal impact of these 16p11.2 copy-number variants indicates that severe obesity and being underweight could have mirror aetiologies, possibly through contrasting effects on energy balance.","[Jacquemont, Sebastien; Zufferey, Flore; Martinet, Danielle; Beckmann, Noam D.; Belfiore, Marco; Addor, Marie-Claude; Fellmann, Florence; Ferrarini, Alessandra; Hippolyte, Loyse; Beckmann, Jacques S.] CHU Vaudois, Serv Med Genet, CH-1011 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Reymond, Alexandre; Harewood, Louise; Walha, Faida; Chrast, Jacqueline; Didelot, Gerard; Witwicki, Robert M.] Univ Lausanne, Ctr Integrat Genom, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Walters, Robin G.; Van Haelst, Mieke M.; Coin, Lachlan; Moustafa, Julia S.

Over one billion people worldwide have hypertension (>= 140 mm Hg systolic blood pressure or >= 90 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure)(2). Even small increments in blood pressure are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events(3). This genome-wide association study of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, which used a multi-stage design in 200,000 individuals of European descent, identified sixteen novel loci: six of these loci contain genes previously known or suspected to regulate blood pressure (GUCY1A3-GUCY1B3, NPR3-C5orf23, ADM, FURIN-FES, GOSR2, GNAS-EDN3); the other ten provide new clues to blood pressure physiology. A genetic risk score based on 29 genome-wide significant variants was associated with hypertension, left ventricular wall thickness, stroke and coronary artery disease, but not kidney disease or kidney function. We also observed associations with blood pressure in East Asian, South Asian and African ancestry individuals. Our findings provide new insights into the genetics and biology of blood pressure, and suggest potential novel therapeutic pathways for cardiovascular disease prevention.","[Ehret, Georg B.; Pihur, Vasyl; Khanh-Dung Hoang Nguyen; Arking, Dan E.; Hilton, Gina; Chakravarti, Aravinda] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, McKusick Nathans Inst Genet Med, Ctr Complex Dis Genom, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Ehret, Georg B.; Bochud, Murielle] CHU Vaudois, Inst Social & Prevent Med IUMSP, CH-1005 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Ehret, Georg B.; Bochud, Murielle] Univ Lausanne, CH-1005 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Ehret, Georg B.] Univ Hosp Geneva, Dept Specialties Internal Med, CH-1211 Geneva 14, Switzerland; [Munroe, Patricia B.; Shaw-Hawkins, Sue; Caulfield, Mark J.; Johnson, Toby] Queen Mary Univ London, Barts & London Sch Med & Dent, William Harvey Res Inst, Genome Ctr, London EC1M 6BQ, England; [Rice, Kenneth M.] Univ Washington, Dept Biostat, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Johnson, Andrew D.; Hwang, Shih-Jen; Wang, Thomas J.; Vasan, Ramachandran S.; Larson, Martin G.; Levy, Daniel] Framingham Heart Dis Epidemiol Study, Framingham, MA 01702 USA; [Johnson, Andrew D.; Hwang, Shih-Jen; Levy, Daniel] NHLBI, Bethesda, MD 20824 USA; [Chasman, Daniel I.; Ridker, Paul M.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Prevent Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Smith, Albert V.; Aspelund, Thor; Gudnason, Vilmundur] Univ Iceland, IS-101 Reykajvik, Iceland; [Smith, Albert V.; Aspelund, Thor; Gudnason, Vilmundur] Iceland Heart Assoc, IS-201 Kopavogur, Iceland; [Tobin, Martin D.; Burton, Paul R.; Artigas, Maria Soler; Shrine, Nick R.

Little is known, however, about adipose lipid turnover in humans in health and pathology. To study this in vivo, here we determined lipid age by measuring (14)C derived from above ground nuclear bomb tests in adipocyte lipids. We report that during the average ten-year lifespan of human adipocytes, triglycerides are renewed six times. Lipid age is independent of adipocyte size, is very stable across a wide range of adult ages and does not differ between genders. Adipocyte lipid turnover, however, is strongly related to conditions with disturbed lipid metabolism. In obesity, triglyceride removal rate (lipolysis followed by oxidation) is decreased and the amount of triglycerides stored each year is increased. In contrast, both lipid removal and storage rates are decreased in non-obese patients diagnosed with the most common hereditary form of dyslipidaemia, familial combined hyperlipidaemia. Lipid removal rate is positively correlated with the capacity of adipocytes to break down triglycerides, as assessed through lipolysis, and is inversely related to insulin resistance. Our data support a mechanism in which adipocyte lipid storage and removal have different roles in health and pathology. High storage but low triglyceride removal promotes fat tissue accumulation and obesity. Reduction of both triglyceride storage and removal decreases lipid shunting through adipose tissue and thus promotes dyslipidaemia. We identify adipocyte lipid turnover as a novel target for prevention and treatment of metabolic disease.","[Arner, Peter; Eriksson, Mats; Arner, Erik; Ryden, Mikael] Karolinska Univ Hosp, Dept Med, SE-14186 Stockholm, Sweden; [Bernard, Samuel] Univ Lyon, CNRS UMR 5208, Inst Camille Jordan, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France; [Salehpour, Mehran; Possnert, Goran] Uppsala Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, SE-75120 Uppsala, Sweden; [Liebl, Jakob; Steier, Peter] Univ Vienna, Fac Phys Isotope Res, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Buchholz, Bruce A.] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Ctr Accelerator Mass Spectrometry, Livermore, CA 94551 USA; [Hauner, Hans; Skurk, Thomas] Tech Univ Munich, Else Kroner Fresenius Ctr Nutr Med, D-85350 Weihenstephan, Germany; [Frayn, Keith N.] Churchill Hosp, Oxford Ctr Diabet Endocrinol & Metab, Oxford OX3 7LJ, England; [Spalding, Kirsty L.] Karolinska Inst, Dept Cell & Mol Biol, SE-17177 Stockholm, Sweden","Arner, P (reprint author), Karolinska Univ Hosp, Dept Med, SE-14186 Stockholm, Sweden.",peter.arner@ki.se; kirsty.spalding@ki.se,"Bernard, Samuel/A-5623-2009; Arner, Erik/A-1895-2010; Buchholz, Bruce/G-1356-2011; spalding, kirsty/I-6046-2017","Bernard, Samuel/0000-0002-8442-9968; Arner, Erik/0000-0003-1225-4908; Eriksson, Mats/0000-0001-6481-5549; Skurk, Thomas/0000-0002-6875-1658","Swedish Research Council; Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research; Swedish Heart and Lung Foundation; Novo Nordic Foundation; Swedish Diabetes Foundation; Karolinska Institutet; Swedish Cancer Society; Uppsala BIO, Sweden; NIH/NCRR [RR13461]; ERC [261258-HUFATREG]; European Commission [LSHM-CT-2005-018734, HEALTH-F2-2008-201100]; US Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory [DE-AC52-07NA27344]","This study was supported by the Swedish Research Council, Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research, Swedish Heart and Lung Foundation, Novo Nordic Foundation, Swedish Diabetes Foundation, Strategic Research Program in Diabetes at the Karolinska Institutet, Swedish Cancer Society, Uppsala BIO, Sweden, NIH/NCRR Grant RR13461, ERC grant 261258-HUFATREG and by the projects 'Hepatic and adipose tissue and functions in the metabolic syndrome' (HEPADIP, http://www.hepadip.org/) and 'Adipokines as drug targets to combat adverse effects of excess adipose tissue' (ADAPT, http://www.adapt-eu.net), which were supported by the European Commission as an Integrated Project under the 6th and the 7th Framework Programmes (contract LSHM-CT-2005-018734 and contract HEALTH-F2-2008-201100).

So far, genome-wide association studies have not identified the genetic factors that underlie LVM variation(3), and the regulatory mechanisms for blood-pressure-independent cardiac hypertrophy remain poorly understood(4,5). Unbiased systems genetics approaches in the rat(6,7) now provide a powerful complementary tool to genome-wide association studies, and we applied integrative genomics to dissect a highly replicated, blood-pressure-independent LVM locus on rat chromosome 3p. Here we identified endonuclease G (Endog), which previously was implicated in apoptosis(8) but not hypertrophy, as the gene at the locus, and we found a loss-of-function mutation in Endog that is associated with increased LVM and impaired cardiac function. Inhibition of Endog in cultured cardiomyocytes resulted in an increase in cell size and hypertrophic biomarkers in the absence of pro-hypertrophic stimulation. Genome-wide network analysis unexpectedly implicated ENDOG in fundamental mitochondrial processes that are unrelated to apoptosis. We showed direct regulation of ENDOG by ERR-alpha and PGC1 alpha (which are master regulators of mitochondrial and cardiac function)(9-11), interaction of ENDOG with the mitochondrial genome and ENDOG-mediated regulation of mitochondrial mass. At baseline, the Endog-deleted mouse heart had depleted mitochondria, mitochondrial dysfunction and elevated levels of reactive oxygen species, which were associated with enlarged and steatotic cardiomyocytes. Our study has further established the link between mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive oxygen species and heart disease and has uncovered a role for Endog in maladaptive cardiac hypertrophy.","[McDermott-Roe, Chris; Ahmed, Rizwan; Sun, Xi-Ming; Ware, James; Bottolo, Leonardo; Muckett, Phil; Buchan, Rachel; Lu, Han; Braithwaite, Adam; Petretto, Enrico; Cook, Stuart A.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Hammersmith Hosp, Fac Med, Med Res Council Clin Sci Ctr, London W12 0NN, England; [Ye, Junmei; Zhang, Jisheng; Cardona, Maria; Sanchis, Daniel] Univ Lleida, Biomed Res Inst Lleida IRBLLEIDA, Cell Signaling & Apoptosis Grp, Lleida 25198, Spain; [Serafin, Anna; Canas, Xavier] Platform Appl Res Lab Anim, Barcelona 08028, Spain; [Rowe, Glenn C.; Arany, Zoltan] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Inst, Cardiovasc Inst, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Mancini, Massimiliano] Univ Rome, Dept Radiol Oncol & Anatomopathol Sci, I-00161 Sapienza, Italy; [Hauton, David] Univ Birmingham, Sch Clin & Expt Med, Coll Med & Dent Sci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Marti, Ramon; Garcia-Arumi, Elena] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Recerca Hosp Univ Vall dHebron, Unitat Patol Mitocondrial & Neuromuscular CIBERER, Barcelona 08035, Spain; [Hubner, Norbert] Max Delbruck Ctr Mol Med, D-13125 Berlin, Germany; [Hubner, Norbert] Charite Univ Med Berlin, Campus Charite Mitte, CC4, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Jacob, Howard] Med Coll Wisconsin, Dept Physiol, Milwaukee, WI 53226 USA; [Serikawa, Tadao] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Inst Lab Anim, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Zidek, Vaclav; Papousek, Frantisek; Kolar, Frantisek; Pravenec, Michal] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Inst Physiol, CR-14220 Prague 4, Czech Republic; [Ruiz-Meana, Marisol; Garcia-Dorado, David] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Recerca Hosp Univ Vall dHebron, Grp Patol Cardiovasc, Barcelona 08035, Spain; [Comella, Joan X.] CIBERNED, Cell Signaling & Apoptosis Grp, Barcelona 08035, Spain; [Comella, Joan X.] VHIR, Barcelona 08035, Spain; [Comella, Joan X.] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Barcelona 08035, Spain; [Comella, Joan X.] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Neurociencies, Barcelona 08035, Spain; [Felkin, Leanne E.; Barton, Paul J.

Day length is sensed by the leaves, which produce a mobile signal transported to the shoot apex or underground stems to induce a flowering transition or, respectively, a tuberization transition. Work in Arabidopsis, tomato and rice (Oryza sativa) identified the mobile FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) protein as a main component of the long-range 'florigen', or flowering hormone, signal(1-3). Here we show that expression of the Hd3a gene, the FT orthologue in rice, induces strict short-day potato types(4) to tuberize in long days. Tuber induction is graft transmissible and the Hd3a-GFP protein is detected in the stolons of grafted plants, transport of the fusion protein thus correlating with tuber formation. We provide evidence showing that the potato floral and tuberization transitions are controlled by two different FT-like paralogues (StSP3D and StSP6A) that respond to independent environmental cues, and show that an autorelay mechanism involving CONSTANS modulates expression of the tuberization-control StSP6A gene.","[Navarro, Cristina; Abelenda, Jose A.; Cruz-Oro, Eduard; Cuellar, Carlos A.; Silva, Javier; Prat, Salome] CSIC, Ctr Nacl Biotecnol, Dept Genet Mol Plantas, Madrid 28049, Spain; [Tamaki, Shojiro; Shimamoto, Ko] Nara Inst Sci & Technol, Plant Mol Genet Lab, Ikoma 6300101, Japan","Prat, S (reprint author), CSIC, Ctr Nacl Biotecnol, Dept Genet Mol Plantas, Calle Darwin 3, Madrid 28049, Spain.",sprat@cnb.csic.es,"Navarro, Cristina/L-5967-2014; Prat, Salome/L-9240-2014; Abelenda, Jose/L-8315-2017","Prat, Salome/0000-0003-2684-5485; Abelenda, Jose/0000-0001-7952-4891",Spanish MCyT; EU-SOL European Union; JSPS; CSIC; MEXT of Japan,"We thank J.

Humans have a paralogue, SMN2, whose exon 7 is predominantly skipped(2), but the limited amount of functional, full-length SMN protein expressed from SMN2 cannot fully compensate for a lack of SMN1. SMN is important for the biogenesis of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles(3), but downstream splicing targets involved in pathogenesis remain elusive. There is no effective SMA treatment, but SMN restoration in spinal cord motor neurons is thought to be necessary and sufficient(4). Non-central nervous system (CNS) pathologies, including cardiovascular defects, were recently reported in severe SMA mouse models and patients(5-8), reflecting autonomic dysfunction or direct effects in cardiac tissues. Here we compared systemic versus CNS restoration of SMN in a severe mouse model(9,10). We used an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), ASO-10-27, that effectively corrects SMN2 splicing and restores SMN expression in motor neurons after intracerebroventricular injection(11,12). Systemic administration of ASO-10-27 to neonates robustly rescued severe SMA mice, much more effectively than intracerebroventricular administration; subcutaneous injections extended the median lifespan by 25 fold. Furthermore, neonatal SMA mice had decreased hepatic Igfals expression, leading to a pronounced reduction in circulating insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), and ASO-10-27 treatment restored IGF1 to normal levels. These results suggest that the liver is important in SMA pathogenesis, underscoring the importance of SMN in peripheral tissues, and demonstrate the efficacy of a promising drug candidate.","[Hua, Yimin; Sahashi, Kentaro; Horev, Guy; Krainer, Adrian R.] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; [Rigo, Frank; Hung, Gene; Bennett, C.

In FCMD, the SVA insertion occurs in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the fukutin gene. The pathogenic mechanism for FCMD is unknown, and no effective clinical treatments exist. Here we show that aberrant messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing, induced by SVA exon-trapping, underlies the molecular pathogenesis of FCMD. Quantitative mRNA analysis pinpointed a region that was missing from transcripts in patients with FCMD. This region spans part of the 3' end of the fukutin coding region, a proximal part of the 3' UTR and the SVA insertion. Correspondingly, fukutin mRNA transcripts in patients with FCMD and SVA knock-in model mice were shorter than the expected length. Sequence analysis revealed an abnormal splicing event, provoked by a strong acceptor site in SVA and a rare alternative donor site in fukutin exon 10. The resulting product truncates the fukutin carboxy (C) terminus and adds 129 amino acids encoded by the SVA. Introduction of antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) targeting the splice acceptor, the predicted exonic splicing enhancer and the intronic splicing enhancer prevented pathogenic exon-trapping by SVA in cells of patients with FCMD and model mice, rescuing normal fukutin mRNA expression and protein production. AON treatment also restored fukutin functions, including O-glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan (alpha-DG) and laminin binding by alpha-DG. Moreover, we observe exon-trapping in other SVA insertions associated with disease (hypercholesterolemia(4), neutral lipid storage disease(5)) and human-specific SVA insertion in a novel gene. Thus, although splicing into SVA is known(6-8), we have discovered in human disease a role for SVA-mediated exon-trapping and demonstrated the promise of splicing modulation therapy as the first radical clinical treatment for FCMD and other SVA-mediated diseases.","[Taniguchi-Ikeda, Mariko; Kobayashi, Kazuhiro; Kanagawa, Motoi; Yu, Chih-chieh; Mori, Kouhei; Oda, Tetsuya; Kuga, Atsushi; Toda, Tatsushi] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Med, Div Neurol Mol Brain Sci, Kobe, Hyogo 6500017, Japan; [Taniguchi-Ikeda, Mariko] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Med, Div Gen Pediat, Kobe, Hyogo 6500017, Japan; [Kurahashi, Hiroki] Fujita Hlth Univ, Inst Comprehens Med Sci, Div Mol Genet, Aichi 4701192, Japan; [Akman, Hasan O.; DiMauro, Salvatore] Columbia Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Neurol, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Kaji, Ryuji] Univ Tokushima, Grad Sch, Dept Clin Neurosci, Tokushima 7708503, Japan; [Yokota, Toshifumi] Univ Alberta, Fac Med & Dent, Dept Med Genet, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H7, Canada; [Takeda, Shin'ichi] Natl Ctr Neurol & Psychiat, Natl Inst Neurosci, Dept Mol Therapy, Kodaira, Tokyo 1878502, Japan","Toda, T (reprint author), Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Med, Div Neurol Mol Brain Sci, Kobe, Hyogo 6500017, Japan.",toda@med.kobe-u.ac.jp,,,"National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry [20B-13]; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [23249049, 21689030, 20790980]; Takeda Science Foundation","We thank S.

Bacteriophage T7 gene product 4 is a model hexameric helicase that has been observed to use dTTP, but not ATP, to unwind double-stranded (ds)DNA as it translocates from 5' to 3' along single-stranded (ss)DNA(2-6). Whether and how different subunits of the helicase coordinate their chemo-mechanical activities and DNA binding during translocation is still under debate(1,7). Here we address this question using a single-molecule approach to monitor helicase unwinding. We found that T7 helicase does in fact unwind dsDNA in the presence of ATP and that the unwinding rate is even faster than that with dTTP. However, unwinding traces showed a remarkable sawtooth pattern where processive unwinding was repeatedly interrupted by sudden slippage events, ultimately preventing unwinding over a substantial distance. This behaviour was not observed with dTTP alone and was greatly reduced when ATP solution was supplemented with a small amount of dTTP. These findings presented an opportunity to use nucleotide mixtures to investigate helicase subunit coordination. We found that T7 helicase binds and hydrolyses ATP and dTTP by competitive kinetics such that the unwinding rate is dictated simply by their respective maximum rates V(max), Michaelis constants K(M) and concentrations. In contrast, processivity does not follow a simple competitive behaviour and shows a cooperative dependence on nucleotide concentrations. This does not agree with an uncoordinated mechanism where each subunit functions independently, but supports a model where nearly all subunits coordinate their chemo-mechanical activities and DNA binding. Our data indicate that only one subunit at a time can accept a nucleotide while other subunits are nucleotide-ligated and thus they interact with the DNA to ensure processivity. Such subunit coordination may be general to many ring-shaped helicases and reveals a potential mechanism for regulation of DNA unwinding during replication.","[Sun, Bo; Johnson, Daniel S.; Smith, Benjamin Y.; Wang, Michelle D.] Cornell Univ, Dept Phys, Lab Atom & Solid State Phys, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Sun, Bo; Johnson, Daniel S.; Smith, Benjamin Y.; Wang, Michelle D.] Cornell Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Patel, Gayatri; Pandey, Manjula; Patel, Smita S.] Univ Med & Dent New Jersey, Robert Wood Johnson Med Sch, Dept Biochem, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA","Wang, MD (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Dept Phys, Lab Atom & Solid State Phys, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",patelss@umdnj.edu; mwang@physics.cornell.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health [GM059849, GM55310]; National Science Foundation [MCB-0820293]; Cornell's Molecular Biophysics Training Grant [T32GM008267]","We thank members of the Wang laboratory for critical reading of the manuscript.

Here we present the crystal structure of the active state ternary complex composed of agonist-occupied monomeric beta(2)AR and nucleotide-free Gs heterotrimer. The principal interactions between the beta(2)AR and Gs involve the amino-and carboxy-terminal a-helices of Gs, with conformational changes propagating to the nucleotide-binding pocket. The largest conformational changes in the beta(2)AR include a 14 angstrom outward movement at the cytoplasmic end of transmembrane segment 6 (TM6) and an alpha-helical extension of the cytoplasmic end of TM5. The most surprising observation is a major displacement of the alpha-helical domain of G alpha s relative to the Ras-like GTPase domain. This crystal structure represents the first high-resolution view of transmembrane signalling by a GPCR.","[Rasmussen, Soren G.

General relativity has not hitherto been tested on cosmological scales independently of the assumptions of the Lambda CDM model. Here we report an observation of the gravitational redshift of light coming from galaxies in clusters at the 99 per cent confidence level, based on archival data(3).

In less massive stars(2) such as the Sun, convection transports mass and energy through the outer 30 per cent of the star and excites a rich spectrum of resonant acoustic modes. Based on the solar example, with no firm theoretical basis, models predict that the convective envelope in delta Sct stars extends only about 1 per cent of the radius(3), but with sufficient energy to excite solar-like oscillations(4,5). This was not observed before the Kepler mission(6), so the presence of a convective envelope in the models has been questioned.

Single-shot read-out of the state of a multi-quantum-bit (multi-qubit) register would allow direct investigation of quantum correlations (entanglement), and would give access to further key resources such as quantum error correction and deterministic quantum teleportation(1). Although spins in solids are attractive candidates for scalable quantum information processing, their single-shot detection has been achieved only for isolated qubits(3-6). Here we demonstrate the preparation and measurement of a multi-spin quantum register in a low-temperature solid-state system by implementing resonant optical excitation techniques originally developed in atomic physics. We achieve high-fidelity read-out of the electronic spin associated with a single nitrogen-vacancy centre in diamond, and use this read-out to project up to three nearby nuclear spin qubits onto a well-defined state(7). Conversely, we can distinguish the state of the nuclear spins in a single shot by mapping it onto, and subsequently measuring, the electronic spin(5,8). Finally, we show compatibility with qubit control: we demonstrate initialization, coherent manipulation and single-shot read-out in a single experiment on a two-qubit register, using techniques suitable for extension to larger registers. These results pave the way for a test of Bell's inequalities on solid-state spins and the implementation of measurement-based quantum information protocols.","[Robledo, Lucio; Bernien, Hannes; Hensen, Bas; Alkemade, Paul F.

Interpreting the O-18/O-16 variability has proved difficult, however, because oxygen isotopes in CO2 are influenced by both the carbon cycle and the water cycle(2). Previous attention focused on the decreasing O-18/O-16 ratio in the 1990s, observed by the global Cooperative Air Sampling Network of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Earth System Research Laboratory. This decrease was attributed variously to a number of processes including an increase in Northern Hemisphere soil respiration(3); a global increase in C-4 crops at the expense of C-3 forests(4); and environmental conditions, such as atmospheric turbulence(5) and solar radiation(6), that affect CO2 exchange between leaves and the atmosphere. Here we present 30 years' worth of data on O-18/O-16 in CO2 from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography global flask network and show that the interannual variability is strongly related to the El Nino/Southern Oscillation. We suggest that the redistribution of moisture and rainfall in the tropics during an El Nino increases the O-18/O-16 ratio of precipitation and plant water, and that this signal is then passed on to atmospheric CO2 by biosphere-atmosphere gas exchange. We show how the decay time of the El Nino anomaly in this data set can be useful in constraining global gross primary production. Our analysis shows a rapid recovery from El Nino events, implying a shorter cycling time of CO2 with respect to the terrestrial biosphere and oceans than previously estimated. Our analysis suggests that current estimates of global gross primary production, of 120 petagrams of carbon per year(7), may be too low, and that a best guess of 150-175 petagrams of carbon per year better reflects the observed rapid cycling of CO2. Although still tentative, such a revision would present a new benchmark by which to evaluate global biospheric carbon cycling models.","[Welp, Lisa R.; Keeling, Ralph F.; Bollenbacher, Alane F.; Piper, Stephen C.; Yoshimura, Kei; Wahlen, Martin] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Meijer, Harro A.

This approach has been successfully used to assess cell-type identity(1-3). Here we use transcriptomic data to address a long-standing uncertainty in evolutionary biology, the identity of avian wing digits(4,5). Embryological evidence clearly identifies the three wing digits as developing from digit positions 2, 3 and 4 (ref. 6), whereas palaeontological data suggest that they are digits I, II and III7. We compare the transcriptomes of the wing and foot digits and find a strong signal that unites the first wing digit with the first foot digit, even though the first wing digit develops from embryological position 2. Interestingly, our transcriptomic data of the posterior digits show a higher degree of differentiation among forelimb digits compared with hindlimb digits. These data show that in the stem lineage of birds the first digit underwent a translocation from digit position 1 to position 2, and further indicate that the posterior wing digits have unique identities contrary to any model of avian digit identity proposed so far(5,8).","[Wang, Zhe; Young, Rebecca L.; Wagner, Guenter P.] Yale Univ, Yale Syst Biol Inst, West Haven, CT 06516 USA; [Wang, Zhe; Young, Rebecca L.; Wagner, Guenter P.] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, West Haven, CT 06516 USA; [Xue, Huiling] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, New Haven, CT 06510 USA","Wagner, GP (reprint author), Yale Univ, Yale Syst Biol Inst, West Haven, CT 06516 USA.",gunter.wagner@yale.edu,,"Wagner, Gunter/0000-0002-3097-002X",Yale Science Development Fund,"The authors thank J.

Among amniotes, genome sequences are available for mammals and birds(2-4), but not for non-avian reptiles. Here we report the genome sequence of the North American green anole lizard, Anolis carolinensis. We find that A. carolinensis microchromosomes are highly syntenic with chicken microchromosomes, yet do not exhibit the high GC and low repeat content that are characteristic of avian microchromosomes(2). Also, A. carolinensis mobile elements are very young and diverse-more so than in any other sequenced amniote genome. The GC content of this lizard genome is also unusual in its homogeneity, unlike the regionally variable GC content found in mammals and birds(5). We describe and assign sequence to the previously unknown A. carolinensis X chromosome. Comparative gene analysis shows that amniote egg proteins have evolved significantly more rapidly than other proteins.

Although genetic data support a critical role for inflammasomes in immune defence and inflammatory diseases(3), the molecular basis by which individual inflammasomes respond to specific stimuli remains poorly understood. The inflammasome that contains the NLRC4 (NLR family, CARD domain containing 4) protein was previously shown to be activated in response to two distinct bacterial proteins, flagellin(4,5) and PrgJ(6), a conserved component of pathogen-associated type III secretion systems. However, direct binding between NLRC4 and flagellin or PrgJ has never been demonstrated. A homologue of NLRC4, NAIP5 (NLR family, apoptosis inhibitory protein 5), has been implicated in activation of NLRC4 (refs 7-11), but is widely assumed to have only an auxiliary role(1,2), as NAIP5 is often dispensable for NLRC4 activation(7,8). However, Naip5 is a member of a small multigene family(12), raising the possibility of redundancy and functional specialization among Naip genes. Here we show in mice that different NAIP paralogues determine the specificity of the NLRC4 inflammasome for distinct bacterial ligands. In particular, we found that activation of endogenous NLRC4 by bacterial PrgJ requires NAIP2, a previously uncharacterized member of the NAIP gene family, whereas NAIP5 and NAIP6 activate NLRC4 specifically in response to bacterial flagellin. We dissected the biochemical mechanism underlying the requirement for NAIP proteins by use of a reconstituted NLRC4 inflammasome system. We found that NAIP proteins control ligand-dependent oligomerization of NLRC4 and that the NAIP2-NLRC4 complex physically associates with PrgJ but not flagellin, whereas NAIP5-NLRC4 associates with flagellin but not PrgJ. Our results identify NAIPs as immune sensor proteins and provide biochemical evidence for a simple receptor-ligand model for activation of the NAIP-NLRC4 inflammasomes.","[Kofoed, Eric M.; Vance, Russell E.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Div Immunol & Pathogenesis, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Vance, RE (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Div Immunol & Pathogenesis, 229 Stanley Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",rvance@berkeley.edu,,,"Burroughs Wellcome Fund; Cancer Research Institute; NIH [AI075039, AI080749, AI063302]","Work in R.E.V.'s laboratory is supported by Investigator Awards from the Burroughs Wellcome Fund and the Cancer Research Institute and by NIH grants AI075039, AI080749 and AI063302.

The inflammasome assembled by the NOD-like receptor (NLR) protein NLRC4 responds to bacterial flagellin and a conserved type III secretion system (TTSS) rod component(3-5). How the NLRC4 inflammasome detects the two bacterial products and the molecular mechanism of NLRC4 inflammasome activation are not understood. Here we show that NAIP5, a BIR-domain NLR protein required for Legionella pneumophila replication in mouse macrophages(6), is a universal component of the flagellin-NLRC4 pathway. NAIP5 directly and specifically interacted with flagellin, which determined the inflammasome-stimulation activities of different bacterial flagellins. NAIP5 engagement by flagellin promoted a physical NAIP5-NLRC4 association, rendering full reconstitution of a flagellin-responsive NLRC4 inflammasome in non-macrophage cells. The related NAIP2 functioned analogously to NAIP5, serving as a specific inflammasome receptor for TTSS rod proteins such as Salmonella PrgJ and Burkholderia BsaK. Genetic analysis of Chromobacterium violaceum infection revealed that the TTSS needle protein CprI can stimulate NLRC4 inflammasome activation in human macrophages. Similarly, CprI is specifically recognized by human NAIP, the sole NAIP family member in human. The finding that NAIP proteins are inflammasome receptors for bacterial flagellin and TTSS apparatus components further predicts that the remaining NAIP family members may recognize other unidentified microbial products to activate NLRC4 inflammasome-mediated innate immunity.","[Zhao, Yue; Yang, Jieling; Shi, Jianjin; Gong, Yi-Nan; Lu, Qiuhe; Xu, Hao; Liu, Liping; Shao, Feng] Natl Inst Biol Sci, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Yue; Yang, Jieling] Peking Union Med Coll, Beijing 100730, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Yue; Yang, Jieling] Chinese Acad Med Sci, Grad Program, Beijing 100730, Peoples R China","Shao, F (reprint author), Natl Inst Biol Sci, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China.",shaofeng@nibs.ac.cn,,"Shi, Jianjin/0000-0001-8048-5180","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Programs) [2010CB835400, 2012CB518700]","We thank V.

Impaired Ca(2+) uptake resulting from decreased expression and reduced activity of SERCA2a is a hallmark of heart failure(1). Accordingly, restoration of SERCA2a expression by gene transfer has proved to be effective in improving cardiac function in heart-failure patients(2), as well as in animal models(3). The small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) can be conjugated to lysine residues of target proteins(4), and is involved in many cellular processes(5). Here we show that SERCA2a is SUMOylated at lysines 480 and 585 and that this SUMOylation is essential for preserving SERCA2a ATPase activity and stability in mouse and human cells. The levels of SUMO1 and the SUMOylation of SERCA2a itself were greatly reduced in failing hearts. SUMO1 restitution by adeno-associated-virus-mediated gene delivery maintained the protein abundance of SERCA2a and markedly improved cardiac function in mice with heart failure. This effect was comparable to SERCA2A gene delivery. Moreover, SUMO1 overexpression in isolated cardiomyocytes augmented contractility and accelerated Ca(2+) decay. Transgene-mediated SUMO1 overexpression rescued cardiac dysfunction induced by pressure overload concomitantly with increased SERCA2a function. By contrast, downregulation of SUMO1 using small hairpin RNA (shRNA) accelerated pressure-overload-induced deterioration of cardiac function and was accompanied by decreased SERCA2a function. However, knockdown of SERCA2a resulted in severe contractile dysfunction both in vitro and in vivo, which was not rescued by overexpression of SUMO1. Taken together, our data show that SUMOylation is a critical post-translational modification that regulates SERCA2a function, and provide a platform for the design of novel therapeutic strategies for heart failure.","[Kho, Changwon; Lee, Ahyoung; Jeong, Dongtak; Chaanine, Antoine H.; Hajjar, Roger J.] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Cardiovasc Res Ctr, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Oh, Jae Gyun; Park, Woo Jin] Gwangju Inst Sci & Technol, Coll Life Sci, Kwangju 500712, South Korea; [Kizana, Eddy] Westmead Hosp, Westmead Millennium Inst, Sydney Med Sch, Westmead, NSW 2145, Australia; [Kizana, Eddy] Westmead Hosp, Dept Cardiol, Westmead, NSW 2145, Australia","Hajjar, RJ (reprint author), Mt Sinai Sch Med, Cardiovasc Res Ctr, 1 Gustave L Levy Pl,Box 1030, New York, NY 10029 USA.",roger.hajjar@mssm.edu,,,"NIH [RO1 HL083156, HL080498, HL093183, P20HL100396]; Global Research Laboratory of the Korean Ministry of Science and Technology [M6-0605-00-0001]","This work is supported by NIH RO1 HL083156, HL080498, HL093183 and P20HL100396 (R.J.H.).

The paternal genome in a zygote undergoes active DNA demethylation before the first mitosis(2,3). The biological significance and mechanisms of this paternal epigenome remodelling have remained unclear(4). Here we report that, within mouse zygotes, oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) occurs on the paternal genome, changing 5mC into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). Furthermore, we demonstrate that the dioxygenase Tet3 (ref. 5) is enriched specifically in the male pronucleus. In Tet3-deficient zygotes from conditional knockout mice, paternal-genome conversion of 5mC into 5hmC fails to occur and the level of 5mC remains constant. Deficiency of Tet3 also impedes the demethylation process of the paternal Oct4 and Nanog genes and delays the subsequent activation of a paternally derived Oct4 transgene in early embryos. Female mice depleted of Tet3 in the germ line show severely reduced fecundity and their heterozygous mutant offspring lacking maternal Tet3 suffer an increased incidence of developmental failure. Oocytes lacking Tet3 also seem to have a reduced ability to reprogram the injected nuclei from somatic cells. Therefore, Tet3-mediated DNA hydroxylation is involved in epigenetic reprogramming of the zygotic paternal DNA following natural fertilization and may also contribute to somatic cell nuclear reprogramming during animal cloning.","[Yang, Hui; Shi, Linyu; Li, Jinsong] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Biol Sci, Inst Biochem & Cell Biol, State Key Lab Cell Biol, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China; [Gu, Tian-Peng; Guo, Fan; Wu, Hai-Ping; Xu, Gui-Fang; Liu, Wei; Xie, Zhi-Guo; Xu, Guo-Liang] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Biol Sci, Inst Biochem & Cell Biol, Grp DNA Metab,State Key Lab Mol Biol, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China; [He, Xinyi; Deng, Zixin] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Life Sci & Biotechnol, State Key Lab Microbial Metab, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China; [Jin, Seung-gi; Pfeifer, Gerd P.] Beckman Res Inst City Hope, Dept Canc Biol, Duarte, CA 91010 USA; [Iqbal, Khursheed; Szabo, Piroska E.] Beckman Res Inst City Hope, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Duarte, CA 91010 USA; [Shi, Yujiang Geno] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Endocrinol Diabet & Hypertens, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Shi, Yujiang Geno] Brigham & Womens Hosp, BCMP, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Shi, Yujiang Geno] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Li, JS (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Biol Sci, Inst Biochem & Cell Biol, State Key Lab Cell Biol, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China.",jsli@sibs.ac.cn; glxu@sibs.ac.cn,"Waha, Andreas/J-2950-2014","Szabo, Piroska/0000-0001-9314-7009; Guo, Fan/0000-0002-0165-073X","Ministry of Science and Technology China [2007CB947503, 2007CB947101, 2009CB941101]; National Science Foundation of China [30730059, 30871430]; Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA01010301, XDA01010403, KSCX2-YW-R-110]; NIH [GM078458]","We thank C.

Nucleotide exchange, or more precisely, GDP dissociation from the G protein alpha-subunit, is the key step towards G protein activation and initiation of downstream signalling cascades. Despite a wealth of biochemical and biophysical studies on inactive and active conformations of several heterotrimeric G proteins, the molecular underpinnings of G protein activation remain elusive. To characterize this mechanism, we applied peptide amide hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry to probe changes in the structure of the heterotrimeric bovine G protein, Gs (the stimulatory G protein for adenylyl cyclase) on formation of a complex with agonist-bound human beta(2) adrenergic receptor (beta(2)AR). Here we report structural links between the receptor-binding surface and the nucleotide-binding pocket of Gs that undergo higher levels of hydrogen-deuterium exchange than would be predicted from the crystal structure of the beta(2)AR-Gs complex. Together with X-ray crystallographic and electron microscopic data of the beta(2)AR-Gs complex (from refs 2, 3), we provide a rationale for a mechanism of nucleotide exchange, whereby the receptor perturbs the structure of the amino-terminal region of the alpha-subunit of Gs and consequently alters the 'P-loop' that binds the beta-phosphate in GDP. As with the Ras family of small-molecular-weight G proteins, P-loop stabilization and beta-phosphate coordination are key determinants of GDP (and GTP) binding affinity.","[DeVree, Brian T.; Calinski, Diane; Sunahara, Roger K.] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Chung, Ka Young; Rasmussen, Soren G.

Poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) is composed of repeating ADPribose units linked via a unique glycosidic ribose-ribose bond, and is synthesized from NAD by PAR polymerases(1,2). PAR glycohydrolase (PARG) is the only protein capable of specific hydrolysis of the ribose-ribose bonds present in PAR chains; its deficiency leads to cell death(3,4). Here we show that filamentous fungi and a number of bacteria possess a divergent form of PARG that has all the main characteristics of the human PARG enzyme. We present the first PARG crystal structure (derived from the bacterium Thermomonospora curvata), which reveals that the PARG catalytic domain is a distant member of the ubiquitous ADP-ribose-binding macrodomain family(5,6). High-resolution structures of T. curvata PARG in complexes with ADP-ribose and the PARG inhibitor ADP-HPD, complemented by biochemical studies, allow us to propose a model for PAR binding and catalysis by PARG. The insights into the PARG structure and catalytic mechanism should greatly improve our understanding of how PARG activity controls reversible protein poly(ADP-ribosyl) ation and potentially of how the defects in this regulation are linked to human disease.","[Slade, Dea; Barkauskaite, Eva; Weston, Ria; Ahel, Ivan] Univ Manchester, Paterson Inst Canc Res, Canc Res UK, Manchester M20 4BX, Lancs, England; [Slade, Dea] Univ Paris 05, Fac Med, INSERM, U1001, F-75015 Paris, France; [Dunstan, Mark S.; Dixon, Neil; Leys, David] Manchester Interdisciplinary Bioctr, Manchester M1 7DN, Lancs, England; [Lafite, Pierre] Univ Orleans, ICOA, CNRS, UMR 6005, F-45067 Orleans, France; [Ahel, Marijan] Rudjer Boskovic Inst, HR-10000 Zagreb, Croatia","Ahel, I (reprint author), Univ Manchester, Paterson Inst Canc Res, Canc Res UK, Wilmslow Rd, Manchester M20 4BX, Lancs, England.",iahel@picr.man.ac.uk,"dixon, neil/E-5230-2012; Dunstan, Mark/B-8934-2013; Lafite, Pierre/F-6806-2011","dixon, neil/0000-0001-9065-6764; Lafite, Pierre/0000-0003-1637-4966; Weston, Ria/0000-0001-8316-0728",Cancer Research UK; AXA Research Fund,"We thank G.

Gene expression in seedlings differed for nearly half of expressed genes and was frequently associated with cis variants within 5 kilobases, as were intron retention alternative splicing events.

Here we report in mice a key Igh V(D)J recombination regulatory region, termed intergenic control region 1 (IGCR1), which lies between the V-H and D clusters. Functionally, IGCR1 uses CTCF looping/insulator factor-binding elements and, correspondingly, mediates Igh loops containing distant enhancers. IGCR1 promotes normal B-cell development and balances antibody repertoires by inhibiting transcription and rearrangement of D-H-proximal V-H gene segments and promoting rearrangement of distal V-H segments. IGCR1 maintains ordered and lineage-specific V-H(D)J(H) recombination by suppressing V-H joining to D segments not joined to J(H) segments, and V-H to DJ(H) joins in thymocytes, respectively. IGCR1 is also required for feedback regulation and allelic exclusion of proximal V-H-to-DJ(H) recombination.

Pairs of quasars, each with a massive black hole at the centre of its galaxy, have separations of 6,000 to 300,000 light years (refs 2 and 3; 1 parsec = 3.26 light years) and exemplify the first stages of this gravitational interaction. The final stages of the black-hole merging process, through binary black holes and final collapse into a single black hole with gravitational wave emission, are consistent with the sub-light-year separation inferred from the optical spectra(4) and light-variability(5) of two such quasars. The double active nuclei of a few nearby galaxies with disrupted morphology and intense star formation (such as NGC 6240 with a separation(6) of about 2,600 light years and Mrk 463 with a separation(7) of about 13,000 light years between the nuclei) demonstrate the importance of major mergers of equal-mass spiral galaxies in this evolution; such mergers lead to an elliptical galaxy(8), as in the case of the double-radio-nucleus elliptical galaxy 0402+379 (with a separation of about 24 light years between the nuclei)(9). Minor mergers of a spiral galaxy with a smaller companion should be a more common occurrence, evolving into spiral galaxies with active massive black-hole pairs(10), but have hitherto not been seen. Here we report the presence of two active massive black holes, separated by about 490 light years, in the Seyfert(11) galaxy NGC 3393 (50 Mpc, about 160 million light years). The regular spiral morphology and predominantly old circum-nuclear stellar population(12) of this galaxy, and the closeness of the black holes embedded in the bulge, provide a hitherto missing observational point to the study of galaxy/black hole evolution. Comparison of our observations with current theoretical models of mergers suggests that they are the result of minor merger evolution(10).","[Fabbiano, G.; Wang, Junfeng; Elvis, M.; Risaliti, G.] Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys CfA, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Risaliti, G.] INAF Arcetri, I-50125 Florence, Italy","Fabbiano, G (reprint author), Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys CfA, 60 Garden St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",gfabbiano@cfa.harvard.edu,"; XRAY, SUZAKU/A-1808-2009","Risaliti, Guido/0000-0002-3556-977X; ",NASA,This work was supported by a NASA grant (with Principal Investigator J.W.).

Isolating and detecting a single flying electron after propagation, in a similar manner to quantum optics experiments with single photons(1,2), is therefore a challenging task. So far only a few experiments have been performed in a high-mobility two-dimensional electron gas in which the electron propagates almost ballistically(3-5). In these previous works, flying electrons were detected by means of the current generated by an ensemble of electrons, and electron correlations were encrypted in the current noise. Here we demonstrate the experimental realization of high-efficiency single-electron source and detector for a single electron propagating isolated from the other electrons through a one-dimensional channel. The moving potential is excited by a surface acoustic wave, which carries the single electron along the one-dimensional channel at a speed of 3 mu m ns(-1). When this quantum channel is placed between two quantum dots several micrometres apart, a single electron can be transported from one quantum dot to the other with quantum efficiencies of emission and detection of 96% and 92%, respectively. Furthermore, the transfer of the electron can be triggered on a timescale shorter than the coherence time T-2* of GaAs spin qubits(6). Our work opens new avenues with which to study the teleportation of a single electron spin and the distant interaction between spatially separated qubits in a condensed-matter system.","[Hermelin, Sylvain; Saminadayar, Laurent; Baeuerle, Christopher; Meunier, Tristan] CNRS, Inst Neel, F-38042 Grenoble, France; [Hermelin, Sylvain; Saminadayar, Laurent; Baeuerle, Christopher; Meunier, Tristan] Univ Grenoble 1, F-38042 Grenoble, France; [Takada, Shintaro; Yamamoto, Michihisa; Tarucha, Seigo] Univ Tokyo, Dept Appl Phys, Tokyo 1138656, Japan; [Yamamoto, Michihisa] ERATO JST, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3310012, Japan; [Tarucha, Seigo] ICORP Int Cooperat Res Project Quantum Spin Infor, Atsugi, Kanagawa 2430198, Japan; [Wieck, Andreas D.] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Lehrstuhl Angew Festkorperphys, D-44780 Bochum, Germany; [Saminadayar, Laurent] Inst Univ France, F-75005 Paris, France","Bauerle, C (reprint author), CNRS, Inst Neel, F-38042 Grenoble, France.",bauerle@grenoble.cnrs.fr; tristan.meunier@grenoble.cnrs.fr,"Bauerle, Christopher/A-3972-2012; TARUCHA, SEIGO/I-7030-2012; Wieck, Andreas Dirk/C-5129-2009; Bauerle, Christopher/S-8973-2016; Yamamoto, Michihisa/E-6850-2017","Wieck, Andreas Dirk/0000-0001-9776-2922; Bauerle, Christopher/0000-0001-7393-0346; Yamamoto, Michihisa/0000-0001-9113-6461","ERATO-JST [080300000477]; Special Coordination Funds for Promoting Science and Technology (NanoQuine); Japan Science and Technology Agency Strategic International Cooperative Program; Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology; Harvard University; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SPP1285]; Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung [QuaHLRep 01BQ1035]; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (DREI) - Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [PRC 424, L08519]; Marie-Curie European Reintegration Grant [224786]; Nanoscience Foundation of Grenoble;  [20684011]","We thank Y.

For example, in a quantum computer(1) decoherence and circuit complexity can be reduced by separating quantum bit (qubit) manipulation from measurement and by providing a means of transporting electrons between the corresponding parts of the circuit(2). Highly controlled tunnelling between neighbouring dots has been demonstrated(3,4), and our ability to manipulate electrons in single-and double-dot systems is improving rapidly(5-8). For distances greater than a few hundred nanometres, neither free propagation nor tunnelling is viable while maintaining confinement of single electrons. Here we show how a single electron may be captured in a surface acoustic wave minimum and transferred from one quantum dot to a second, unoccupied, dot along a long, empty channel. The transfer direction may be reversed and the same electron moved back and forth more than sixty times-a cumulative distance of 0.25 mm-without error. Such on-chip transfer extends communication between quantum dots to a range that may allow the integration of discrete quantum information processing components and devices.","[McNeil, R. P.

Inspirations from natural non-wetting structures(2-6), particularly the leaves of the lotus, have led to the development of liquid-repellent microtextured surfaces that rely on the formation of a stable air-liquid interface(7-9). Despite over a decade of intense research, these surfaces are, however, still plagued with problems that restrict their practical applications: limited oleophobicity with high contact angle hysteresis(9), failure under pressure(10-12) and upon physical damage(1,7,11), inability to self-heal and high production cost(1,11). To address these challenges, here we report a strategy to create self-healing, slippery liquid-infused porous surface(s) (SLIPS) with exceptional liquid- and ice-repellency, pressure stability and enhanced optical transparency. Our approach-inspired by Nepenthes pitcher plants(13)-is conceptually different from the lotus effect, because we use nano/microstructured substrates to lock in place the infused lubricating fluid. We define the requirements for which the lubricant forms a stable, defect-free and inert 'slippery' interface. This surface outperforms its natural counterparts(2-6) and state-of-the-art synthetic liquid-repellent surfaces(8,9,14-16) in its capability to repel various simple and complex liquids (water, hydrocarbons, crude oil and blood), maintain low contact angle hysteresis (<2.5 degrees), quickly restore liquid-repellency after physical damage (within 0.1-1 s), resist ice adhesion, and function at high pressures (up to about 680 atm). We show that these properties are insensitive to the precise geometry of the underlying substrate, making our approach applicable to various inexpensive, low-surface-energy structured materials (such as porous Teflon membrane). We envision that these slippery surfaces will be useful in fluid handling and transportation, optical sensing, medicine, and as self-cleaning and antifouling materials operating in extreme environments.","[Wong, Tak-Sing; Kang, Sung Hoon; Tang, Sindy K.

Here we present iron data from a suite of mid-Proterozoic marine mudstones. Contrary to the popular model, our results indicate that ferruginous (anoxic and Fe(2+)-rich) conditions were both spatially and temporally extensive across diverse palaeogeographic settings in the mid-Proterozoic ocean, inviting new models for the temporal distribution of iron formations and the availability of bioessential trace elements during a critical window for eukaryotic evolution.","[Planavsky, Noah J.; Scott, Clinton T.; Li, Chao; Reinhard, Christopher T.; Kelly, Amy E.; Love, Gordon D.; Lyons, Timothy W.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Earth Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [McGoldrick, Peter] Univ Tasmania, CODES ARC Ctr Excellence Ore Deposits, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Li, Chao] China Univ Geosci, State Key Lab Biogeol & Environm Geol, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Chu, Xuelei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geol & Geophys, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Bekker, Andrey] Univ Manitoba, Dept Geol Sci, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada","Lyons, TW (reprint author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Earth Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",timothy.lyons@ucr.edu,,"Li, Chao/0000-0001-9861-661X",National Science Foundation (NSF); Geological Society of America; American Philosophical Society; NSF Division of Earth Sciences; NASA; Astrobiology Institute; UTAS Visiting Fellows programme; Agouron Institute; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Australian Research Council,"We thank P.

Previous investigations of molluscan phylogeny, based primarily on nuclear ribosomal gene sequences(1-3) or morphological data(4), have been unsuccessful at elucidating these relationships. Recently, phylogenomic studies using dozens to hundreds of genes have greatly improved our understanding of deep animal relationships(5). However, limited genomic resources spanning molluscan diversity has prevented use of a phylogenomic approach. Here we use transcriptome and genome data from all major lineages (except Monoplacophora) and recover a well-supported topology for Mollusca. Our results strongly support the Aculifera hypothesis placing Polyplacophora (chitons) in a clade with a monophyletic Aplacophora (worm-like molluscs). Additionally, within Conchifera, a sister-taxon relationship between Gastropoda and Bivalvia is supported. This grouping has received little consideration and contains most (>95%) molluscan species. Thus we propose the node-based name Pleistomollusca. In light of these results, we examined the evolution of morphological characters and found support for advanced cephalization and shells as possibly having multiple origins within Mollusca.","[Kocot, Kevin M.; Cannon, Johanna T.; Santos, Scott R.; Halanych, Kenneth M.] Auburn Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Todt, Christiane; Schander, Christoffer] Univ Bergen, Dept Biol, NO-5020 Bergen, Norway; [Todt, Christiane; Schander, Christoffer] Univ Bergen, Ctr Geobiol, NO-5020 Bergen, Norway; [Citarella, Mathew R.; Kohn, Andrea B.; Moroz, Leonid L.] Univ Florida, Whitney Lab Marine Biosci, St Augustine, FL 32080 USA; [Meyer, Achim; Lieb, Bernhard] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Zool, D-55099 Mainz, Germany; [Moroz, Leonid L.] Univ Florida, Dept Neurosci, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Kocot, KM (reprint author), Auburn Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 101 Rouse Life Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",kmkocot@auburn.edu; ken@auburn.edu,"Santos, Scott/A-7472-2009; Halanych, Ken/A-9480-2009","Halanych, Ken/0000-0002-8658-9674; Cannon, Johanna/0000-0002-3920-7741","National Science Foundation (NSF) [0744649, 0821622]; National Institute of Health (NIH) [1RO1NS06076, 1R01GM097502, R21 RR025699, R21DA030118]; McKnight Brain Research Foundation; German Science Foundation [Li 998/9-1]; University of Bergen (Norway) [226270]","We thank W.

These discoveries were tempered in all cases by the emergence of resistant microbes(1,2). This history has been interpreted to mean that antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria is a modern phenomenon; this view is reinforced by the fact that collections of microbes that predate the antibiotic era are highly susceptible to antibiotics(3). Here we report targeted metagenomic analyses of rigorously authenticated ancient DNA from 30,000-year-old Beringian permafrost sediments and the identification of a highly diverse collection of genes encoding resistance to beta-lactam, tetracycline and glycopeptide antibiotics. Structure and function studies on the complete vancomycin resistance element VanA confirmed its similarity to modern variants.

Historically, there have been seven acknowledged cholera pandemics; recent outbreaks in Zimbabwe and Haiti are included in the seventh and ongoing pandemic(1). Only isolates in serogroup O1 (consisting of two biotypes known as 'classical' and 'El Tor') and the derivative O139 (refs 2, 3) can cause epidemic cholera(2). It is believed that the first six cholera pandemics were caused by the classical biotype, but El Tor has subsequently spread globally and replaced the classical biotype in the current pandemic(1). Detailed molecular epidemiological mapping of cholera has been compromised by a reliance on sub-genomic regions such as mobile elements to infer relationships, making El Tor isolates associated with the seventh pandemic seem superficially diverse. To understand the underlying phylogeny of the lineage responsible for the current pandemic, we identified high-resolution markers (single nucleotide polymorphisms; SNPs) in 154 whole-genome sequences of globally and temporally representative V. cholerae isolates. Using this phylogeny, we show here that the seventh pandemic has spread from the Bay of Bengal in at least three independent but overlapping waves with a common ancestor in the 1950s, and identify several transcontinental transmission events.

Here we probed the neutralizing antibody repertoires of four human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected donors with remarkably broad and potent neutralizing responses and rescued 17 new monoclonal antibodies that neutralize broadly across clades. Many of the new monoclonal antibodies are almost tenfold more potent than the recently described PG9, PG16 and VRC01 broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and 100-fold more potent than the original prototype HIV broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies(1-3). The monoclonal antibodies largely recapitulate the neutralization breadth found in the corresponding donor serum and many recognize novel epitopes on envelope (Env) glycoprotein gp120, illuminating new targets for vaccine design. Analysis of neutralization by the full complement of anti-HIV broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies now available reveals that certain combinations of antibodies should offer markedly more favourable coverage of the enormous diversity of global circulating viruses than others and these combinations might be sought in active or passive immunization regimes. Overall, the isolation of multiple HIV broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies from several donors that, in aggregate, provide broad coverage at low concentrations is a highly positive indicator for the eventual design of an effective antibody-based HIV vaccine.","[Walker, Laura M.; Huber, Michael; Doores, Katie J.; Falkowska, Emilia; Ramos, Alejandra; Burton, Dennis R.; Poignard, Pascal] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Immunol & Microbial Sci, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Walker, Laura M.; Huber, Michael; Doores, Katie J.; Falkowska, Emilia; Pejchal, Robert; Julien, Jean-Philippe; Ramos, Alejandra; Wilson, Ian A.; Burton, Dennis R.; Poignard, Pascal] Scripps Res Inst, IAVI Neutralizing Antibody Ctr, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Huber, Michael; Doores, Katie J.; Falkowska, Emilia; Burton, Dennis R.] Ragon Inst MGH MIT & Harvard, Boston, MA 02129 USA; [Pejchal, Robert; Julien, Jean-Philippe; Wilson, Ian A.] Scripps Res Inst, Skaggs Inst Chem Biol, Dept Mol Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Wang, Sheng-Kai; Wong, Chi-Huey] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Chem, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Chan-Hui, Po-Ying; Moyle, Matthew; Mitcham, Jennifer L.; Hammond, Phillip W.; Olsen, Ole A.] Theraclone Sci Inc, Seattle, WA 98104 USA; [Pham Phung; Wrin, Terri] Monogram Biosci Inc, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Fling, Steven; Phogat, Sanjay; Simek, Melissa D.; Koff, Wayne C.; Poignard, Pascal] Int AIDS Vaccine Initiat, New York, NY 10038 USA","Burton, DR (reprint author), Scripps Res Inst, Dept Immunol & Microbial Sci, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",burton@scripps.edu; poignard@scripps.edu,"poignard, pascal/N-6678-2013; Huber, Michael/B-8509-2015","Julien, Jean-Philippe/0000-0001-7602-3995; Doores, Katie/0000-0002-5507-1725",IAVI; NIAID; Ragon Institute; United States for International Development (USAID),"We thank N.

The ability to synthesize large segments of DNA allows the engineering of pathways and genomes according to arbitrary sets of design principles. Here we describe a synthetic yeast genome project, Sc2.0, and the first partially synthetic eukaryotic chromosomes, Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome synIXR, and semi-synVIL. We defined three design principles for a synthetic genome as follows: first, it should result in a (near) wild-type phenotype and fitness; second, it should lack destabilizing elements such as tRNA genes or transposons(8,9); and third, it should have genetic flexibility to facilitate future studies. The synthetic genome features several systemic modifications complying with the design principles, including an inducible evolution system, SCRaMbLE (synthetic chromosome rearrangement and modification by loxP-mediated evolution). We show the utility of SCRaMbLE as a novel method of combinatorial mutagenesis, capable of generating complex genotypes and a broad variety of phenotypes. When complete, the fully synthetic genome will allow massive restructuring of the yeast genome, and may open the door to a new type of combinatorial genetics based entirely on variations in gene content and copy number.","[Dymond, Jessica S.; Richardson, Sarah M.; Coombes, Candice E.; Babatz, Timothy; Dai, Junbiao; Boeke, Annabel C.; Bader, Joel S.; Boeke, Jef D.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, High Throughput Biol Ctr, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Dymond, Jessica S.; Coombes, Candice E.; Dai, Junbiao; Boeke, Jef D.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Richardson, Sarah M.; Babatz, Timothy] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, McKusick Nathans Inst Genet Med, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Muller, Heloise; Annaluru, Narayana; Schwerzmann, Joy W.; Chandrasegaran, Srinivasan] Johns Hopkins Univ, Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Blake, William J.] Codon Devices, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Lindstrom, Derek L.; Gottschling, Daniel E.] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Bader, Joel S.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Whiting Sch Engn, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA","Boeke, JD (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, High Throughput Biol Ctr, 733 North Broadway, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",jboeke@jhmi.edu,"Bader, Joel/A-1818-2009","Bader, Joel/0000-0002-6020-4625; Richardson, Sarah/0000-0002-9820-9421; Boeke, Jef/0000-0001-5322-4946",National Science Foundation [MCB0718846]; Microsoft; Department of Energy [DE-FG02097ER25308]; National Institutes of Health [AG023779]; Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale,"We thank G.

These drugs are full classical agonists for this nuclear receptor, but recent data have shown that many PPAR gamma-based drugs have a separate biochemical activity, blocking the obesity-linked phosphorylation of PPAR gamma by Cdk5 (ref. 2). Here we describe novel synthetic compounds that have a unique mode of binding to PPAR gamma, completely lack classical transcriptional agonism and block the Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation in cultured adipocytes and in insulin-resistant mice. Moreover, one such compound, SR1664, has potent antidiabetic activity while not causing the fluid retention and weight gain that are serious side effects of many of the PPAR gamma drugs. Unlike TZDs, SR1664 also does not interfere with bone formation in culture. These data illustrate that new classes of antidiabetes drugs can be developed by specifically targeting the Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of PPAR gamma.","[Choi, Jang Hyun; Banks, Alexander S.; Laznik, Dina; Spiegelman, Bruce M.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Choi, Jang Hyun; Banks, Alexander S.; Laznik, Dina; Spiegelman, Bruce M.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Div Metab & Chron Dis, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Choi, Jang Hyun; Banks, Alexander S.; Laznik, Dina; Spiegelman, Bruce M.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Kamenecka, Theodore M.; Shin, Youseung; He, Yuanjun; Cameron, Michael D.; Griffin, Patrick R.] Scripps Res Inst, Translat Res Inst, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA; [Busby, Scott A.; Chalmers, Michael J.; Kumar, Naresh; Kuruvilla, Dana S.; Marciano, David P.; Cameron, Michael D.; Griffin, Patrick R.] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol Therapeut, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA; [Kamenecka, Theodore M.; Cameron, Michael D.; Griffin, Patrick R.] Scripps Res Inst, SRMSC, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA; [Bruning, John B.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Biochem & Biophys, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Jurczak, Michael J.; Shulman, Gerald I.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Internal Med, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Jurczak, Michael J.; Shulman, Gerald I.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Cellular & Mol Physiol, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Schuerer, Stephan C.; Vidovic, Dusica] Univ Miami, Ctr Computat Sci, Miami, FL 33136 USA","Spiegelman, BM (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Biol, 44 Binney St, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",bruce_spiegelman@dfci.harvard.edu; pgriffin@scripps.edu,"; Choi, Jang Hyun/B-3055-2012; Banks, Alexander/B-4832-2012","Jurczak, Michael/0000-0002-6335-6915; Banks, Alexander/0000-0003-1787-6925","National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Mental Health [U54-MH074404]; National Institute of General Medical Sciences [R01-GM084041]; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases [1RC4DK090861]; NIH [DK31405]","We are grateful for support from S.

Studies of the effects of genes on ageing are vulnerable to confounding effects of genetic background(4). Here were-examined the reported effects of sirtuin overexpression on ageing and found that standardization of genetic background and the use of appropriate controls abolished the apparent effects in both C. elegans and Drosophila. In C. elegans, outcrossing of a line with high-level sir-2.1 overexpression(1) abrogated the longevity increase, but did not abrogate sir-2.1 overexpression. Instead, longevity co-segregated with a second-site mutation affecting sensory neurons. Outcrossing of a line with low-copy-number sir-2.1 overexpression(2) also abrogated longevity. A Drosophila strain with ubiquitous overexpression of dSir2 using the UAS-GAL4 system was long-lived relative to wild-type controls, as previously reported(3), but was not long-lived relative to the appropriate transgenic controls, and nor was a new line with stronger overexpression of dSir2. These findings underscore the importance of controlling for genetic background and for the mutagenic effects of transgene insertions in studies of genetic effects on lifespan. The life-extending effect of dietary restriction on ageing in Drosophila has also been reported to be dSir2 dependent(3). We found that dietary restriction increased fly lifespan independently of dSir2. Our findings do not rule out a role for sirtuins in determination of metazoan lifespan, but they do cast doubt on the robustness of the previously reported effects of sirtuins on lifespan in C. elegans and Drosophila.","[Burnett, Camilla; Valentini, Sara; Cabreiro, Filipe; Goss, Martin; Piper, Matthew D.; Hoddinott, Matthew; McElwee, Joshua J.; Ackerman, Daniel; Au, Catherine; Vinti, Giovanna; Riesen, Michele; Partridge, Linda; Gems, David] UCL, Inst Hlth Ageing, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Burnett, Camilla; Valentini, Sara; Cabreiro, Filipe; Goss, Martin; Piper, Matthew D.; Hoddinott, Matthew; McElwee, Joshua J.; Ackerman, Daniel; Au, Catherine; Vinti, Giovanna; Riesen, Michele; Partridge, Linda; Gems, David] UCL, Dept Genet Evolut & Environm, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Somogyvari, Milan; Soti, Csaba] Semmelweis Univ, Dept Med Chem, H-1094 Budapest, Hungary; [Sutphin, George L.; Kaeberlein, Matt] Univ Washington, Dept Pathol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Sutphin, George L.; Kaeberlein, Matt] Univ Washington, Mol & Cellular Biol Program, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Leko, Vid; Bedalov, Antonio] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Vazquez-Manrique, Rafael P.; Orfila, Anne-Marie; Neri, Christian] INSERM, Lab Neuronal Cell Biol & Pathol, U894, F-75014 Paris, France; [Vazquez-Manrique, Rafael P.; Orfila, Anne-Marie; Neri, Christian] Univ Paris 05, F-75014 Paris, France; [Howard, Ken] UCL, MRC Lab Mol Cell Biol, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Partridge, Linda] Max Planck Inst Biol Ageing, D-50931 Cologne, Germany","Gems, D (reprint author), UCL, Inst Hlth Ageing, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",david.gems@ucl.ac.uk,"; Piper, Matthew/C-1714-2008; Partridge, Linda/A-5501-2010; Neri, Christian/F-6729-2013; Partridge, Linda/E-7342-2015; Soti, Csaba/O-6070-2017","Kaeberlein, Matt/0000-0002-1311-3421; Piper, Matthew/0000-0003-3245-7219; Soti, Csaba/0000-0002-4057-7678; Gomes Cabreiro, Filipe/0000-0002-3696-4843; Vazquez-Manrique, Rafael/0000-0002-1594-0033; Gems, David/0000-0002-6653-4676","National Institutes of Health National Center for Research Resources; European Union [FP6-036894, FP6-518230]; Hungarian Science Foundation and Norway Grants [NNF-78794]; INSERM; ANR, Paris; National Institutes of Health [CA129132, R01AG031108, T32AG000057]; Wellcome Trust","We thank A.

Here we use cryo-electron microscopy to determine the subnanometre structures of Cascade before and after binding to a target sequence. These structures reveal a sea-horse-shaped architecture in which the crRNA is displayed along a helical arrangement of protein subunits that protect the crRNA from degradation while maintaining its availability for base pairing. Cascade engages invading nucleic acids through high-affinity base-pairing interactions near the 5' end of the crRNA. Base pairing extends along the crRNA, resulting in a series of short helical segments that trigger a concerted conformational change. This conformational rearrangement may serve as a signal that recruits a trans-acting nuclease (Cas3) for destruction of invading nucleic-acid sequences.","[Wiedenheft, Blake; Zhou, Kaihong; Doudna, Jennifer A.; Nogales, Eva] Univ Calif Berkeley, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Wiedenheft, Blake; Zhou, Kaihong; Doudna, Jennifer A.; Nogales, Eva] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Lander, Gabriel C.; Nogales, Eva] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Div Life Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Jore, Matthijs M.; Brouns, Stan J.

Regulation of polyamine synthesis is mainly achieved by controlling the activity of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) through an unusual mechanism involving ODC antizyme(1,4), the binding of which disrupts homodimeric ODC and targets it for ubiquitin-independent degradation by the 26S proteasome(5). Whereas mammals express several antizyme genes(6), we have identified a single orthologue, termed OAZ1, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae(7). Similar to its mammalian counterparts, OAZ1 synthesis is induced with rising intracellular polyamine concentrations, which also inhibit ubiquitin-dependent degradation of the OAZ1 protein(7). Together, these mechanisms contribute to a homeostatic feedback regulation of polyamines(1,7,8). Antizyme synthesis involves a conserved +1 ribosomal frameshifting (RFS) event at an internal STOP codon during decoding of its messenger RNA(6-10). Here we used S. cerevisiae OAZ1 to dissect the enigmatic mechanism underlying polyamine regulation of RFS. In contrast with previous assumptions, we report here that the nascent antizyme polypeptide is the relevant polyamine sensor that operates in cis to negatively regulate upstream RFS on the polysomes, where its own mRNA is being translated. At low polyamine levels, the emerging antizyme polypeptide inhibits completion of its synthesis causing a ribosome pile-up on antizyme mRNA, whereas polyamine binding to nascent antizyme promotes completion of its synthesis. Thus, our study reveals a novel autoregulatory mechanism, in which binding of a small metabolite to a nascent sensor protein stimulates the latter's synthesis co-translationally.","[Kurian, Leo; Palanimurugan, R.; Goedderz, Daniela; Dohmen, R.

In particular, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), a minor yet dynamic phospholipid component of cell membranes, is known to regulate many different ion channels(2-8). PIP2 is the primary agonist for classical inward rectifier (Kir2) channels, through which this lipid can regulate a cell's resting membrane potential(2,7-9). However, the molecular mechanism by which PIP2 exerts its action is unknown. Here we present the X-ray crystal structure of a Kir2.2 channel in complex with a short-chain (dioctanoyl) derivative of PIP2. We found that PIP2 binds at an interface between the transmembrane domain (TMD) and the cytoplasmic domain (CTD). The PIP2-binding site consists of a conserved non-specific phospholipid-binding region in the TMD and a specific phosphatidylinositol-binding region in the CTD. On PIP2 binding, a flexible expansion linker contracts to a compact helical structure, the CTD translates 6 angstrom and becomes tethered to the TMD and the inner helix gate begins to open. In contrast, the small anionic lipid dioctanoyl glycerol pyrophosphatidic acid (PPA) also binds to the non-specific TMD region, but not to the specific phosphatidylinositol region, and thus fails to engage the CTD or open the channel. Our results show how PIP2 can control the resting membrane potential through a specific ion-channel-receptor-ligand interaction that brings about a large conformational change, analogous to neurotransmitter activation of ion channels at synapses.","[Hansen, Scott B.; Tao, Xiao; MacKinnon, Roderick] Rockefeller Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Lab Mol Neurobiol & Biophys, New York, NY 10065 USA","MacKinnon, R (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Lab Mol Neurobiol & Biophys, 1230 York Ave, New York, NY 10065 USA.",mackinn@rockefeller.edu,,,Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NIBIB NIH HHS [P30 EB009998],,,30,232,236,3,53,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Sep,2011,477,7365,,,,,495,U152,,10.1038/nature10370,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,822WH,WOS:000295080500047,21874019.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,roderick,mackinnon,male,1,76,na,na

To address this, we performed loss-of-function studies on most lincRNAs expressed in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and characterized the effects on gene expression. Here we show that knockdown of lincRNAs has major consequences on gene expression patterns, comparable to knockdown of well-known ES cell regulators. Notably, lincRNAs primarily affect gene expression in trans. Knockdown of dozens of lincRNAs causes either exit from the pluripotent state or upregulation of lineage commitment programs. We integrate lincRNAs into the molecular circuitry of ES cells and show that lincRNA genes are regulated by key transcription factors and that lincRNA transcripts bind to multiple chromatin regulatory proteins to affect shared gene expression programs.

Various theories implicate(9-18) spatial variation of the carrier mobility as being responsible for IMR. Here we show that IMR in lightly doped silicon can be significantly enhanced through hole injection, and then tuned by an applied current to arise at low magnetic fields. In our devices, the 'inhomogeneity' is provided by the p-n boundary formed between regions where conduction is dominated by the minority and majority charge carriers (holes and electrons) respectively; application of a magnetic field distorts the current in the boundary region, resulting in large magnetoresistance. Because this is an intrinsically spatial effect, the geometry of the device can be used to enhance IMR further: we designed an IMR device whose room-temperature field sensitivity at low fields was greatly improved, with magnetoresistance reaching 10% at 0.07 T and 100% at 0.2 T, approaching the performance of commercial giant-magnetoresistance devices(19,20). The combination of high sensitivity to low magnetic fields and large high-field response should make this device concept attractive to the magnetic-field sensing industry. Moreover, because our device is based on a conventional silicon platform, it should be possible to integrate it with existing silicon devices and so aid the development of silicon-based magnetoelectronics.","[Wan, Caihua; Zhang, Xiaozhong; Gao, Xili; Wang, Jimin; Tan, Xinyu] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Adv Mat Lab, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Wan, Caihua; Zhang, Xiaozhong; Gao, Xili; Wang, Jimin; Tan, Xinyu] Tsinghua Univ, Beijing Natl Ctr Electron Microscopy, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China","Zhang, XZ (reprint author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Adv Mat Lab, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",xzzhang@tsinghua.edu.cn,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2009CB929202]; National Science Foundation of China [11074141, U0734001]",This work is supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (grant 2009CB929202) and the National Science Foundation of China (grants 11074141 and U0734001).

An appreciation of attractive interactions such as van der Waals forces (which include London dispersion forces) is necessary to understand chemical bonding and reactivity fully. This is evident from, for example, the strongly debated origin of the higher stability of branched alkanes relative to linear alkanes(1,2) and the possibility of constructing hydrocarbons with extraordinarily long C-C single bonds through steric crowding(3). Although empirical bond distance/bond strength relationships have been established for C-C bonds(4) (longer C-C bonds have smaller bond dissociation energies), these have no present theoretical basis(5). Nevertheless, these empirical considerations are fundamental to structural and energetic evaluations in chemistry(6,7), as summarized by Pauling(8) as early as 1960 and confirmed more recently(4). Here we report the preparation of hydrocarbons with extremely long C-C bonds (up to 1.704 angstrom), the longest such bonds observed so far in alkanes. The prepared compounds are unexpectedly stable-noticeable decomposition occurs only above 200 degrees C. We prepared the alkanes by coupling nanometre-sized, diamond-like, highly rigid structures known as diamondoids(9). The extraordinary stability of the coupling products is due to overall attractive dispersion interactions between the intramolecular H center dot center dot center dot H contact surfaces, as is evident from density functional theory computations with(10) and without inclusion of dispersion corrections.","[Schreiner, Peter R.; Hausmann, Heike; Fokin, Andrey A.] Univ Giessen, Inst Organ Chem, D-35392 Giessen, Germany; [Chernish, Lesya V.; Gunchenko, Pavel A.; Tikhonchuk, Evgeniya Yu.; Fokin, Andrey A.] Kiev Polytech Inst, Dept Organ Chem, UA-03056 Kiev, Ukraine; [Serafin, Michael; Schlecht, Sabine] Univ Giessen, Inst Anorgan Chem, D-35392 Giessen, Germany; [Dahl, Jeremy E.

Despite the importance of LIPs, controversy surrounds even the basic idea that they form through melting in the heads of thermal mantle plumes(2,3,6-10). The Permo-Triassic Siberian Traps(11)-the type example and the largest continental LIP1,12-is located on thick cratonic lithosphere(1,12) and was synchronous with the largest known mass-extinction event(1). However, there is no evidence of pre-magmatic uplift or of a large lithospheric stretching(7), as predicted above a plume head(2,6,9). Moreover, estimates of magmatic CO2 degassing from the Siberian Traps are considered insufficient to trigger climatic crises(13-15), leading to the hypothesis that the release of thermogenic gases from the sediment pile caused the mass extinction(15,16). Here we present petrological evidence for a large amount (15 wt%) of dense recycled oceanic crust in the head of the plume and develop a thermomechanical model that predicts no pre-magmatic uplift and requires no lithospheric extension. The model implies extensive plume melting and heterogeneous erosion of the thick cratonic lithosphere over the course of a few hundred thousand years. The model suggests that massive degassing of CO2 and HCl, mostly from the recycled crust in the plume head, could alone trigger a mass extinction and predicts it happening before the main volcanic phase, in agreement with stratigraphic and geochronological data for the Siberian Traps and other LIPs(5).","[Sobolev, Stephan V.; Petrunin, Alexey G.] Deutsch GeoForschungsZentrum GFZ, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Sobolev, Stephan V.; Petrunin, Alexey G.] Russian Acad Sci, O Yu Schmidt Inst Phys Earth, Moscow 123995, Russia; [Sobolev, Alexander V.; Arndt, Nicholas T.] Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, ISTerre, F-38041 Grenoble 9, France; [Sobolev, Alexander V.; Kuzmin, Dmitry V.] Max Planck Inst Chem, D-55128 Mainz, Germany; [Sobolev, Alexander V.; Krivolutskaya, Nadezhda A.] Russian Acad Sci, VI Vernadsky Inst Geochem & Analyt Chem, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Kuzmin, Dmitry V.; Vasiliev, Yuri R.] Russian Acad Sci, Siberian Branch, VS Sobolev Inst Geol & Mineral, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia; [Radko, Viktor A.] Ltd Liabil Co Norilskgeologiya Norilsk, Norilsk 663330, Russia","Sobolev, SV (reprint author), Deutsch GeoForschungsZentrum GFZ, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany.",stephan@gfz-potsdam.de; alexander.sobolev@ujf-grenoble.fr,"Sobolev, Stephan/G-3813-2011; Sobolev, Alexander /E-6367-2010; Kuzmin, Dmitry/A-3809-2014; Vasiliev, Yurii/A-5374-2014; Krivolutskaya, Nadezhda/C-3554-2015","Sobolev, Stephan/0000-0002-3382-4028; Sobolev, Alexander /0000-0002-1997-2032; Krivolutskaya, Nadezhda/0000-0002-5709-7785","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [SPP 1375 SAMPLE (SO 425/4)]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche, France [ANR-09-CEXC-003-01]; Gottingen University, Germany; Russian Foundation for Basic Research [09-05-01193a]; Russian President [HIII-3919.2010.5]; Earth Sciences Department of Russian Academy","S.V.S. and A.

Some authors have suggested that not just confidence but overconfidence-believing you are better than you are in reality-is advantageous because it serves to increase ambition, morale, resolve, persistence or the credibility of bluffing, generating a self-fulfilling prophecy in which exaggerated confidence actually increases the probability of success(3-8). However, overconfidence also leads to faulty assessments, unrealistic expectations and hazardous decisions, so it remains a puzzle how such a false belief could evolve or remain stable in a population of competing strategies that include accurate, unbiased beliefs. Here we present an evolutionary model showing that, counterintuitively, overconfidence maximizes individual fitness and populations tend to become overconfident, as long as benefits from contested resources are sufficiently large compared with the cost of competition. In contrast, unbiased strategies are only stable under limited conditions. The fact that overconfident populations are evolutionarily stable in a wide range of environments may help to explain why overconfidence remains prevalent today, even if it contributes to hubris, market bubbles, financial collapses, policy failures, disasters and costly wars(9-13).","[Johnson, Dominic D.

Conspecific individuals are an important feature of an animal's environment, and a potential source of selective pressures. Here we show that adaptation of two Caenorhabditis species to growth at high density, a feature common to domestic environments, occurs by reproducible genetic changes to pheromone receptor genes. Chemical communication through pheromones that accumulate during high-density growth causes young nematode larvae to enter the long-lived but non-reproductive dauer stage. Two strains of Caenorhabditis elegans grown at high density have independently acquired multigenic resistance to pheromone-induced dauer formation. In each strain, resistance to the pheromone ascaroside C3 results from a deletion that disrupts the adjacent chemoreceptor genes serpentine receptor class g (srg)-36 and -37. Through misexpression experiments, we show that these genes encode redundant G-protein-coupled receptors for ascaroside C3. Multigenic resistance to dauer formation has also arisen in high-density cultures of a different nematode species, Caenorhabditis briggsae, resulting in part from deletion of an srg gene paralogous to srg-36 and srg-37. These results demonstrate rapid remodelling of the chemoreceptor repertoire as an adaptation to specific environments, and indicate that parallel changes to a common genetic substrate can affect life-history traits across species.","[McGrath, Patrick T.; Xu, Yifan; Garrison, Jennifer L.; Bargmann, Cornelia I.] Rockefeller Univ, Lab Neural Circuits & Behav, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Ailion, Michael] Univ Utah, Dept Biol, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Butcher, Rebecca A.] Univ Florida, Dept Chem, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Bargmann, CI (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Lab Neural Circuits & Behav, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10065 USA.",cori@rockefeller.edu,,"Bargmann, Cornelia/0000-0002-8484-0618",Damon Runyon Fellowship; Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) [GM07739]; Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowship; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [K99 GM092859]; HHMI;  [R00GM87533],"We thank N.

Combining experimental with automated analyses, we identified 711,920 SVs at 281,243 sites in the genomes of thirteen classical and four wild-derived inbred mouse strains. The majority of SVs are less than 1 kilobase in size and 98% are deletions or insertions. The breakpoints of 160,000 SVs were mapped to base pair resolution, allowing us to infer that insertion of retrotransposons causes more than half of SVs. Yet, despite their prevalence, SVs are less likely than other sequence variants to cause gene expression or quantitative phenotypic variation.

Epithelial barrier disruption is considered to be a potential cause of inflammatory bowel disease; however, the mechanisms regulating intestinal epithelial integrity are poorly understood(1,5). Here we show that mice with IEC-specific knockout of FADD (FADD(IEC-KO)), an adaptor protein required for death-receptor-induced apoptosis(6), spontaneously developed epithelial cell necrosis, loss of Paneth cells, enteritis and severe erosive colitis. Genetic deficiency in RIP3, a critical regulator of programmed necrosis(7-9), prevented the development of spontaneous pathology in both the small intestine and colon of FADD(IEC-KO) mice, demonstrating that intestinal inflammation is triggered by RIP3-dependent death of FADD-deficient IECs. Epithelial-specific inhibition of CYLD, a deubiquitinase that regulates cellular necrosis(10), prevented colitis development in FADD(IEC-KO) but not in NEMOIEC-KO mice(11), showing that different mechanisms mediated death of colonic epithelial cells in these two models. In FADD(IEC-KO) mice, TNF deficiency ameliorated colon inflammation, whereas MYD88 deficiency and also elimination of the microbiota prevented colon inflammation, indicating that bacteria-mediated Toll-like-receptor signalling drives colitis by inducing the expression of TNF and other cytokines. However, neither CYLD, TNF or MYD88 deficiency nor elimination of the microbiota could prevent Paneth cell loss and enteritis in FADD(IEC-KO) mice, showing that different mechanisms drive RIP3-dependent necrosis of FADD-deficient IECs in the small and large bowel. Therefore, by inhibiting RIP3-mediated IEC necrosis, FADD preserves epithelial barrier integrity and antibacterial defence, maintains homeostasis and prevents chronic intestinal inflammation. Collectively, these results show that mechanisms preventing RIP3-mediated epithelial cell death are critical for the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis and indicate that programmed necrosis of IECs might be implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, in which Paneth cell and barrier defects are thought to contribute to intestinal inflammation.","[Welz, Patrick-Simon; Wullaert, Andy; Vlantis, Katerina; Kondylis, Vangelis; Fernandez-Majada, Vanesa; Ermolaeva, Maria; Pasparakis, Manolis] Univ Cologne, Ctr Mol Med CMMC, Inst Genet, D-50674 Cologne, Germany; [Kirsch, Petra] Univ Ulm, Tierforschungszentrum, D-89081 Ulm, Germany; [Sterner-Kock, Anja] Univ Cologne, Uniklin Koln, Ctr Med Expt, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; [van Loo, Geert] Univ Ghent VIB, Dept Mol Biomed Res, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium; [van Loo, Geert] Univ Ghent, Dept Biomed Mol Biol, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium","Pasparakis, M (reprint author), Univ Cologne, Ctr Mol Med CMMC, Inst Genet, Zulpicher Str 47A, D-50674 Cologne, Germany.",Pasparakis@uni-koeln.de,"; van Loo, Geert/C-1505-2009; Pasparakis, Manolis/H-9292-2017","Fernandez Majada, Vanesa/0000-0003-4287-5086; Kondylis, Vangelis/0000-0002-6970-8731; Wullaert, Andy/0000-0001-5012-654X; Pasparakis, Manolis/0000-0002-9870-0966","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB670, SFB829]; European Commission (EC) [223151, 223404]; EMBO; 'Group-IDMRP' of Ghent University; International Graduate School in Genetics and Functional Genomics at the University of Cologne","We thank C.

In healthy individuals, the intestinal epithelium maintains a physical barrier, established by the tight contact of cells. Moreover, specialized epithelial cells such as Paneth cells and goblet cells provide innate immune defence functions by secreting mucus and antimicrobial peptides, which hamper access and survival of bacteria adjacent to the epithelium(2). Epithelial cell death is a hallmark of intestinal inflammation and has been discussed as a possible pathogenic mechanism driving Crohn's disease in humans(3). However, the regulation of epithelial cell death and its role in intestinal homeostasis remain poorly understood. Here we demonstrate a critical role for caspase-8 in regulating necroptosis of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and terminal ileitis. Mice with a conditional deletion of caspase-8 in the intestinal epithelium (Casp8(Delta IEC)) spontaneously developed inflammatory lesions in the terminal ileum and were highly susceptible to colitis. Casp8(Delta IEC) mice lacked Paneth cells and showed reduced numbers of goblet cells, indicating dysregulated antimicrobial immune cell functions of the intestinal epithelium. Casp8(Delta IEC) mice showed increased cell death in the Paneth cell area of small intestinal crypts. Epithelial cell death was induced by tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, was associated with increased expression of receptor-interacting protein 3 (Rip3; also known as Ripk3) and could be inhibited on blockade of necroptosis. Lastly, we identified high levels of RIP3 in human Paneth cells and increased necroptosis in the terminal ileum of patients with Crohn's disease, suggesting a potential role of necroptosis in the pathogenesis of this disease. Together, our data demonstrate a critical function of caspase-8 in regulating intestinal homeostasis and in protecting IECs from TNF-alpha-induced necroptotic cell death.","[Guenther, Claudia; Martini, Eva; Wittkopf, Nadine; Weigmann, Benno; Neumann, Helmut; Waldner, Maximilian J.; Neurath, Markus F.; Becker, Christoph] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Dept Med 1, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany; [Amann, Kerstin] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Dept Nephropathol, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany; [Hedrick, Stephen M.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Cellular & Mol Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Tenzer, Stefan] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Immunol, D-55131 Mainz, Germany","Becker, C (reprint author), Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Dept Med 1, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany.",christoph.becker@uk-erlangen.de,"Becker, Christoph/A-6694-2008; hongbo, yi /G-9615-2011; Becker, Christoph/L-2996-2016","Becker, Christoph/0000-0002-1388-1041; Tenzer, Stefan/0000-0003-3034-0017",Interdisciplinary Center for Clinical Research (IZKF) of the University Erlangen-Nuremberg; European Community [202230]; Welcome Trust [WT087768MA]; NIH [AI037988],"The research leading to these results has received funding from the Interdisciplinary Center for Clinical Research (IZKF) of the University Erlangen-Nuremberg and the European Community's 7th Framework Program (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement no. 202230, acronym GENINCA.

Filovirus entry is mediated by the viral spike glycoprotein (GP), which attaches viral particles to the cell surface, delivers them to endosomes and catalyses fusion between viral and endosomal membranes(2). Additional host factors in the endosomal compartment are probably required for viral membrane fusion; however, despite considerable efforts, these critical host factors have defied molecular identification(3-5). Here we describe a genome-wide haploid genetic screen in human cells to identify host factors required for Ebola virus entry. Our screen uncovered 67 mutations disrupting all six members of the homotypic fusion and vacuole protein-sorting (HOPS) multisubunit tethering complex, which is involved in the fusion of endosomes to lysosomes(6), and 39 independent mutations that disrupt the endo/lysosomal cholesterol transporter protein Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1)(7). Cells defective for the HOPS complex or NPC1 function, including primary fibroblasts derived from human Niemann-Pick type C1 disease patients, are resistant to infection by Ebola virus and Marburg virus, but remain fully susceptible to a suite of unrelated viruses. We show that membrane fusion mediated by filovirus glycoproteins and viral escape from the vesicular compartment require the NPC1 protein, independent of its known function in cholesterol transport. Our findings uncover unique features of the entry pathway used by filoviruses and indicate potential antiviral strategies to combat these deadly agents.","[Carette, Jan E.; Obernosterer, Gregor; Brummelkamp, Thijn R.] Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge Ctr 9, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Raaben, Matthijs; Kranzusch, Philip J.; Griffin, April M.; Whelan, Sean P.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Mol Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Wong, Anthony C.; Mulherkar, Nirupama; Chandran, Kartik] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Bronx, NY 10461 USA; [Herbert, Andrew S.; Kuehne, Ana I.; Ruthel, Gordon; Dye, John M.] USA, Med Res Inst Infect Dis, Ft Detrick, MD 21702 USA; [Dal Cin, Paola] Ctr Adv Mol Diagnost, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Brummelkamp, TR (reprint author), Netherlands Canc Inst, Plesmanlaan 121, NL-1066 CX Amsterdam, Netherlands.",John.M.Dye1@us.army.mil; sean_whelan@hms.harvard.edu; kartik.chandran@einstein.yu.edu; t.brummelkamp@nki.nl,,"Raaben, Matthijs/0000-0001-5989-289X","NIH [R01 AI088027, AI081842, U54 AI057159, R21 HG004938]; DTRA Project [CBM.VAXPLAT.05.10.RD.005]; Whitehead Fellows Program; Burroughs Wellcome Investigators in the Pathogenesis of Infectious Disease Award; NIH at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine [T32 GM007288, T32 AI070117]","We would like to thank M.

The clinical symptoms are manifestations of the massive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to infection(1) and in many outbreaks, mortality exceeds 75%. The unpredictable onset, ease of transmission, rapid progression of disease, high mortality and lack of effective vaccine or therapy have created a high level of public concern about EboV(2). Here we report the identification of a novel benzylpiperazine adamantane diamide-derived compound that inhibits EboV infection. Using mutant cell lines and informative derivatives of the lead compound, we show that the target of the inhibitor is the endosomal membrane protein Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1). We find that NPC1 is essential for infection, that it binds to the virus glycoprotein (GP), and that antiviral compounds interfere with GP binding to NPC1. Combined with the results of previous studies of GP structure and function, our findings support a model of EboV infection in which cleavage of the GP1 subunit by endosomal cathepsin proteases removes heavily glycosylated domains to expose the amino-terminal domain(3-7), which is a ligand for NPC1 and regulates membrane fusion by the GP2 subunit(8). Thus, NPC1 is essential for EboV entry and a target for antiviral therapy.","[Cote, Marceline; Misasi, John; Bruchez, Anna; Filone, Claire Marie; Li, Qi; Chandran, Kartik; Cunningham, James] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Div Hematol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Misasi, John] Childrens Hosp, Dept Med, Div Infect Dis, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Ren, Tao; Lee, Kyungae] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, New England Reg Ctr Excellence Biodefense & Emerg, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Filone, Claire Marie; Hensley, Lisa] USA, Med Res Inst Infect Dis, Div Virol, Frederick, MD 21702 USA; [Ory, Daniel] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Diabet Cardiovasc Dis Ctr, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Cunningham, James] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Cunningham, J (reprint author), Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Div Hematol, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",jcunningham@rics.bwh.harvard.edu,,,"PIDS-Sanofi-Pasteur Fellowship [K12-HD052896, 5K08AI079381, 5-T32-HL007623]; Fonds de la Recherche en Sante du Quebec; US Army Medical Research and Material Command;  [U54 AI057159];  [R01 CA104266]","We thank B.

The stress response is generally transient because its accompanying effects (for example, immunosuppression, growth inhibition and enhanced catabolism) can be harmful in the long term(2). When chronic, the stress response can be associated with disease symptoms such as peptic ulcers or cardiovascular disorders(3), and epidemiological studies strongly indicate that chronic stress leads to DNA damage(4,5). This stress-induced DNA damage may promote ageing(6), tumorigenesis(4,7), neuropsychiatric conditions(8,9) and miscarriages(10). However, the mechanisms by which these DNA-damage events occur in response to stress are unknown. The stress hormone adrenaline stimulates beta(2)-adrenoreceptors that are expressed throughout the body, including in germline cells and zygotic embryos(11). Activated beta(2)-adrenoreceptors promote Gs-protein-dependent activation of protein kinase A (PKA), followed by the recruitment of beta-arrestins, which desensitize G-protein signalling and function as signal transducers in their own right(12). Here we elucidate a molecular mechanism by which beta-adrenergic catecholamines, acting through both Gs-PKA and beta-arrestin-mediated signalling pathways, trigger DNA damage and suppress p53 levels respectively, thus synergistically leading to the accumulation of DNA damage. In mice and in human cell lines, beta-arrestin-1 (ARRB1), activated via beta(2)-adrenoreceptors, facilitates AKT-mediated activation of MDM2 and also promotes MDM2 binding to, and degradation of, p53, by acting as a molecular scaffold. Catecholamine-induced DNA damage is abrogated in Arrb1-knockout (Arrb1(-/-)) mice, which show preserved p53 levels in both the thymus, an organ that responds prominently to acute or chronic stress(1), and in the testes, in which paternal stress may affect the offspring's genome. Our results highlight the emerging role of ARRB1 as an E3-ligase adaptor in the nucleus, and reveal how DNA damage may accumulate in response to chronic stress.","[Hara, Makoto R.; Kovacs, Jeffrey J.; Whalen, Erin J.; Rajagopal, Sudarshan; Strachan, Ryan T.; Towers, Aaron J.; Williams, Barbara; Lam, Christopher M.; Xiao, Kunhong; Shenoy, Sudha K.; Gregory, Simon G.; Ahn, Seungkirl; Lefkowitz, Robert J.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Med, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Grant, Wayne; Duckett, Derek R.] Scripps Res Inst, Translat Res Inst, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA; [Towers, Aaron J.; Gregory, Simon G.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Ctr Human Genet, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Lefkowitz, Robert J.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Durham, NC 27710 USA","Lefkowitz, RJ (reprint author), Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Med, Durham, NC 27710 USA.",lefko001@receptor-biol.duke.edu,"Rajagopal, Sudarshan/G-8975-2013","Rajagopal, Sudarshan/0000-0002-3443-5040", [HL16037];  [HL70631],"R.J.L. is a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator.

Kinetochores are assembled on a specialized chromatin domain called the centromere, which is characterized by the replacement of nucleosomal histone H3 with the histone H3 variant centromere protein A(CENP-A). CENP-A is essential for centromere and kinetochore formation in all eukaryotes but it is unknown how CENP-A chromatin directs centromere and kinetochore assembly(1). Here we generate synthetic CENP-A chromatin that recapitulates essential steps of centromere and kinetochore assembly in vitro. We show that reconstituted CENP-A chromatin when added to cell-free extracts is sufficient for the assembly of centromere and kinetochore proteins, microtubule binding and stabilization, and mitotic checkpoint function. Using chromatin assembled from histone H3/CENP-A chimaeras, we demonstrate that the conserved carboxy terminus of CENP-A is necessary and sufficient for centromere and kinetochore protein recruitment and function but that the CENP-A targeting domain-required for new CENP-A histone assembly(2)-is not. These data show that two of the primary requirements for accurate chromosome segregation, the assembly of the kinetochore and the propagation of CENP-A chromatin, are specified by different elements in the CENP-A histone. Our unique cell-free system enables complete control and manipulation of the chromatin substrate and thus presents a powerful tool to study centromere and kinetochore assembly.","[Guse, Annika; Carroll, Christopher W.; Moree, Ben; Fuller, Colin J.; Straight, Aaron F.] Stanford Med Sch, Dept Biochem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Straight, AF (reprint author), Stanford Med Sch, Dept Biochem, Beckman 409A, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",astraigh@stanford.edu,"Guse, Annika/I-1183-2013","Guse, Annika/0000-0002-8737-9206; Straight, Aaron/0000-0001-5885-7881",German Research Foundation (DFG); Helen Hay Whitney Foundation; American Heart Association (AHA); Stanford Graduate Fellowship; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R01GM074728];  [T32GM007276],"The authors would like to thank A.

Here we design and use several novel optogenetic tools to causally investigate the cellular E/I balance hypothesis in freely moving mammals, and explore the associated circuit physiology. Elevation, but not reduction, of cellular E/I balance within the mouse medial prefrontal cortex was found to elicit a profound impairment in cellular information processing, associated with specific behavioural impairments and increased high-frequency power in the 30-80 Hz range, which have both been observed in clinical conditions in humans. Consistent with the E/I balance hypothesis, compensatory elevation of inhibitory cell excitability partially rescued social deficits caused by E/I balance elevation.

Here we show that loss of Brca1 in mice results in transcriptional de-repression of the tandemly repeated satellite DNA. Brca1 deficiency is accompanied by a reduction of condensed DNA regions in the genome and loss of ubiquitylation of histone H2A at satellite repeats. BRCA1 binds to satellite DNA regions and ubiquitylates H2A in vivo. Ectopic expression of H2A fused to ubiquitin reverses the effects of BRCA1 loss, indicating that BRCA1 maintains heterochromatin structure via ubiquitylation of histone H2A. Satellite DNA de-repression was also observed in mouse and human BRCA1-deficient breast cancers. Ectopic expression of satellite DNA can phenocopy BRCA1 loss in centrosome amplification, cell-cycle checkpoint defects, DNA damage and genomic instability.

M87 is one of the closest examples of this phenomenon, and the structure of its jet has been probed on a scale of about 100 Schwarzschild radii (R(s), the radius of the event horizon)(3). However, the location of the central black hole relative to the jet base (a bright compact radio 'core') remains elusive(4,5). Observations of other jets indicate that the central engines are located about 10(4)-10(6)R(s) upstream from the radio core(6-9). Here we report radio observations of M87 at six frequencies that allow us to achieve a positional accuracy of about 20 microarcseconds. As the jet base becomes more transparent at higher frequencies, the multifrequency position measurements of the radio core enable us to determine the upstream end of the jet. The data reveal that the central engine of M87 is located within 14-23R(s) of the radio core at 43 GHz. This implies that the site of material infall onto the black hole and the eventual origin of the jet reside in the bright compact region seen on the image at 43 GHz.","[Hada, Kazuhiro; Hagiwara, Yoshiaki; Kawaguchi, Noriyuki] Grad Univ Adv Studies SOKENDAI, Dept Astron Sci, Tokyo 1818588, Japan; [Hada, Kazuhiro; Kino, Motoki; Nagai, Hiroshi; Hagiwara, Yoshiaki; Kawaguchi, Noriyuki] Natl Astron Observ Japan, Tokyo 1818588, Japan; [Doi, Akihiro; Nagai, Hiroshi] Japan Aerosp Explorat Agcy, Inst Space & Astronaut Sci, Chuo Ku, Kanagawa 2525210, Japan; [Doi, Akihiro] Grad Univ Adv Studies SOKENDAI, Dept Space & Astronaut Sci, Chuo Ku, Kanagawa 2525210, Japan","Hada, K (reprint author), Grad Univ Adv Studies SOKENDAI, Dept Astron Sci, 2-21-1 Osawa, Tokyo 1818588, Japan.",kazuhiro.hada@nao.ac.jp,,,Graduate University for Advanced Studies (Sokendai),"We thank M.

Recently, episodic star formation, powered by changes in the gas content, has been suggested(5). Classical Cepheid variable stars have pulsation periods that decrease with increasing age(6), so it is possible to probe the star-formation history on the basis of the distribution of their periods(7,8). Here we report the presence of three classical Cepheids in the nuclear bulge with pulsation periods of approximately 20 days, within 40 parsecs (projected distance) of the central black hole. No Cepheids with longer or shorter periods were found.

Whether an underlying tendency towards charge order is present in all copper oxides and whether this has any relationship with superconductivity are, however, two highly controversial issues(2,3). To uncover underlying electronic order, magnetic fields strong enough to destabilize superconductivity can be used. Such experiments, including quantum oscillations(4-6) in YBa2Cu3Oy (an extremely clean copper oxide in which charge order has not until now been observed) have suggested that superconductivity competes with spin, rather than charge, order(7-9). Here we report nuclear magnetic resonance measurements showing that high magnetic fields actually induce charge order, without spin order, in the CuO2 planes of YBa2Cu3Oy. The observed static, unidirectional, modulation of the charge density breaks translational symmetry, thus explaining quantum oscillation results, and we argue that it is most probably the same 4a-periodic modulation as in stripe-ordered copper oxides(1). That it develops only when superconductivity fades away and near the same 1/8 hole doping as in La2-xBaxCuO4 (ref. 1) suggests that charge order, although visibly pinned by CuO chains in YBa2Cu3Oy, is an intrinsic propensity of the superconducting planes of high-T-c copper oxides.","[Wu, Tao; Mayaffre, Hadrien; Kraemer, Steffen; Horvatic, Mladen; Berthier, Claude; Julien, Marc-Henri] CNRS, Lab Natl Champs Magnet Intenses, UPR 3228, UJF,UPS,INSA, F-38042 Grenoble, France; [Hardy, W.

One explanation of their over-abundance is a 'late veneer'-a flux of meteorites added to the Earth after core formation as a 'terminal' bombardment that culminated in the cratering of the Moon(2). Some 3.8 billion-year-old rocks from Isua, Greenland, are derived from sources that retain an isotopic memory of events pre-dating this cataclysmic meteorite shower(3,4). These Isua samples thus provide a window on the composition of the Earth before such a late veneer and allow a direct test of its importance in modifying the composition of the planet. Using high-precision (less than 6 parts per million, 2 standard deviations) tungsten isotope analyses of these rocks, here we show that they have a isotopic tungsten ratio W-182/W-184 that is significantly higher (about 13 parts per million) than modern terrestrial samples. This finding is in good agreement with the expected influence of a late veneer. We also show that alternative interpretations, such as partial remixing of a deep-mantle reservoir formed in the Hadean eon(5,6) (more than four billion years ago) or core-mantle interaction(7), do not explain the W isotope data well. The decrease in mantle W-182/W-184 occurs during the Archean eon (about four to three billion years ago), potentially on the same timescale as a notable decrease in Nd-142/Nd-144 (refs 3 and 6). We speculate that both observations can be explained if late meteorite bombardment triggered the onset of the current style of mantle convection.","[Willbold, Matthias; Elliott, Tim] Univ Bristol, Sch Earth Sci, Bristol Isotope Grp, Bristol BS8 1RJ, Avon, England; [Moorbath, Stephen] Univ Oxford, Dept Earth Sci, Oxford OX1 3AN, England","Willbold, M (reprint author), Univ Bristol, Sch Earth Sci, Bristol Isotope Grp, Wills Mem Bldg,Queens Rd, Bristol BS8 1RJ, Avon, England.",m.willbold@bristol.ac.uk,,"Willbold, Matthias/0000-0003-2178-2470","NERC [NE/DO12805/1, NE/H011927/1]; STFC [ST/F002734/1]; DFG [WI 3579/1-1]","We thank the IODP, C.

It remains unclear, though, whether few(8) or many(9) of the species in an ecosystem are needed to sustain the provisioning of ecosystem services. It has been hypothesized that most species would promote ecosystem services if many times, places, functions and environmental changes were considered(9); however, no previous study has considered all of these factors together. Here we show that 84% of the 147 grassland plant species studied in 17 biodiversity experiments promoted ecosystem functioning at least once. Different species promoted ecosystem functioning during different years, at different places, for different functions and under different environmental change scenarios. Furthermore, the species needed to provide one function during multiple years were not the same as those needed to provide multiple functions within one year. Our results indicate that even more species will be needed to maintain ecosystem functioning and services than previously suggested by studies that have either (1) considered only the number of species needed to promote one function under one set of environmental conditions, or (2) separately considered the importance of biodiversity for providing ecosystem functioning across multiple years(10-14), places(15,16), functions(14,17,18) or environmental change scenarios(12,19-22). Therefore, although species may appear functionally redundant when one function is considered under one set of environmental conditions(7), many species are needed to maintain multiple functions at multiple times and places in a changing world.","[Isbell, Forest; Calcagno, Vincent; Loreau, Michel] McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada; [Hector, Andy; Schmid, Bernhard] Univ Zurich, Inst Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Connolly, John] Univ Coll Dublin, UCD Sch Math Sci, Dublin 4, Ireland; [Harpole, W.

Polymorphic supergenes, in which specific combinations of traits are maintained within a single population, were first described for 'pin' and 'thrum' floral types in Primula(1) and Fagopyrum(2), but classic examples are also found in insect mimicry(3-5) and snail morphology(6). Understanding the evolutionary mechanisms that generate these co-adapted gene sets, as well as the mode of limiting the production of unfit recombinant forms, remains a substantial challenge(7-10). Here we show that individual wing-pattern morphs in the polymorphic mimetic butterfly Heliconius numata are associated with different genomic rearrangements at the supergene locus P. These rearrangements tighten the genetic linkage between at least two colour-pattern loci that are known to recombine in closely related species(9-11), with complete suppression of recombination being observed in experimental crosses across a 400-kilobase interval containing at least 18 genes. In natural populations, notable patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) are observed across the entire P region. The resulting divergent haplotype clades and inversion breakpoints are found in complete association with wing-pattern morphs. Our results indicate that allelic combinations at known wing-patterning loci have become locked together in a polymorphic rearrangement at the P locus, forming a supergene that acts as a simple switch between complex adaptive phenotypes found in sympatry. These findings highlight how genomic rearrangements can have a central role in the coexistence of adaptive phenotypes involving several genes acting in concert, by locally limiting recombination and gene flow.","[Joron, Mathieu; Frezal, Lise; Whibley, Annabel] CNRS, Museum Natl Hist Nat, UMR 7205, F-75005 Paris, France; [Joron, Mathieu; Becuwe, Michel] Univ Edinburgh, Inst Evolutionary Biol, Ashworth Labs, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland; [Joron, Mathieu] Leiden Univ, Inst Biol, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands; [Jones, Robert T.; Chamberlain, Nicola L.; Wilkinson, Paul A.; Ffrench-Constant, Richard H.] Univ Exeter, Sch Biosci, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Penryn TR10 9EZ, Cornwall, England; [Lee, Siu F.] Univ Melbourne, Inst Bio21, Dept Genet, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Haag, Christoph R.] Univ Fribourg, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland; [Baxter, Simon W.; Ferguson, Laura; Jiggins, Chris D.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England; [Salazar, Camilo] NAOS Isl, Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Panama City, Panama; [Davidson, Claire; Clark, Richard; Quail, Michael A.; Beasley, Helen; Glithero, Rebecca; Lloyd, Christine; Sims, Sarah; Jones, Matthew C.; Rogers, Jane] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Cambridge CB10 1HH, England","Joron, M (reprint author), CNRS, Museum Natl Hist Nat, UMR 7205, CP50,45 Rue Buffon, F-75005 Paris, France.",joron@mnhn.fr,"Haag, Christoph/B-6488-2009; Whibley, Annabel/G-2836-2011; Jiggins, Chris/B-9960-2008; Joron, Mathieu/C-9178-2009; Salazar, camilo/A-1647-2010; GenePool, The/D-8812-2012; Whibley, Annabel/P-2509-2017","Haag, Christoph/0000-0002-8817-1431; Jiggins, Chris/0000-0002-7809-062X; Joron, Mathieu/0000-0003-1043-4147; Salazar, camilo/0000-0001-9217-6588; Whibley, Annabel/0000-0003-1878-7705; ffrench-Constant, Richard/0000-0001-5385-9888; Davidson, Claire/0000-0002-4910-8202",CNRS; EMBO [ALTF-431-2004]; Royal Society [516002.K5917/ROG]; European Research Council; BBSRC [BBE0118451]; Leverhulme Trust [F/00144AY)]; Leverhulme Research Leadership grant,"We thank M.

Here we present the genome sequence of Atlantic cod, showing evidence for complex thermal adaptations in its haemoglobin gene cluster and an unusual immune architecture compared to other sequenced vertebrates. The genome assembly was obtained exclusively by 454 sequencing of shotgun and paired-end libraries, and automated annotation identified 22,154 genes. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II is a conserved feature of the adaptive immune system of jawed vertebrates(3,4), but we show that Atlantic cod has lost the genes for MHC II, CD4 and invariant chain (Ii) that are essential for the function of this pathway. Nevertheless, Atlantic cod is not exceptionally susceptible to disease under natural conditions(5). We find a highly expanded number of MHC I genes and a unique composition of its Toll-like receptor (TLR) families. This indicates how the Atlantic cod immune system has evolved compensatory mechanisms in both adaptive and innate immunity in the absence of MHC II. These observations affect fundamental assumptions about the evolution of the adaptive immune system and its components in vertebrates.","[Star, Bastiaan; Nederbragt, Alexander J.; Jentoft, Sissel; Grimholt, Unni; Malmstrom, Martin; Rounge, Trine B.; Paulsen, Jonas; Solbakken, Monica H.; Lagesen, Karin; Tooming-Klunderud, Ave; Tina, Kirubakaran G.; Espelund, Mari; Skage, Morten; Berg, Paul R.; Omholt, Stig W.; Stenseth, Nils Chr.; Jakobsen, Kjetill S.] Univ Oslo, Dept Biol, CEES, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Gregers, Tone F.] Univ Oslo, Dept Mol Biosci, Ctr Immune Regulat, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Paulsen, Jonas] Oslo Univ Hosp, Inst Med Informat, Bioinformat Core Facil, N-0310 Oslo, Norway; [Sharma, Animesh; Nepal, Chirag; Jonassen, Inge] Univ Bergen, Dept Informat, N-5020 Bergen, Norway; [Wetten, Ola F.] Hedmark Univ Coll, Dept Nat Sci & Technol, N-2306 Bedriftsenteret, Hamar, Norway; [Wetten, Ola F.] Univ Life Sci, Dept Anim & Aquacultural Sci, N-1432 As, Norway; [Lanzen, Anders] Univ Bergen, Ctr Geobiol, Dept Biol, N-5020 Bergen, Norway; [Lanzen, Anders; Nepal, Chirag; Previti, Christopher; Jonassen, Inge] Uni Res AS, Uni Comp, Computat Biol Unit, N-5020 Bergen, Norway; [Winer, Roger; Knight, James; Du, Lei] 454 Life Sci, Branford, CT 06405 USA; [Vogel, Jan-Hinnerk; Aken, Bronwen; Searle, Steve] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Cambridge CB10 1SA, England; [Andersen, Oivind] Nofima Marine, N-1430 As, Norway; [Edvardsen, Rolf B.; Malde, Ketil] Inst Marine Res, N-5817 Bergen, Norway; [Tina, Kirubakaran G.; Lien, Sigbjorn; Omholt, Stig W.] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Ctr Integrat Genet, CIGENE, Dept Anim & Aquacultural Sci, N-1432 As, Norway; [Karlsen, Bard Ove; Moum, Truls; Johansen, Steinar D.] Univ Nordland, Fac Biosci & Aquaculture, N-8049 Bodo, Norway; [Gjoen, Tor] Univ Oslo, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Biosci, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Kuhl, Heiner; Reinhardt, Richard] Max Planck Inst Mol Genet, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Thorsen, Jim] Sch Vet Sci, Inst Basic Sci & Aquat Med, N-0033 Oslo, Norway; [Johansen, Steinar D.] Univ Tromso, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Med Biol, N-9037 Tromso, Norway","Jakobsen, KS (reprint author), Univ Oslo, Dept Biol, CEES, POB 1066, N-0316 Oslo, Norway.",k.s.jakobsen@bio.uio.no,"Berg, Paul/A-3648-2011; Stenseth, Nils Chr./G-5212-2016; Vogel, Jan-Hinnerk/C-4582-2013; Nederbragt, Alexander/B-8013-2010; Gjoen, Tor /F-2740-2013; wenji, huang/F-4860-2015; Lanzen, Anders/F-3818-2016","Berg, Paul/0000-0002-4974-8509; Stenseth, Nils Chr./0000-0002-1591-5399; Aken, Bronwen/0000-0002-3032-4095; Jonassen, Inge/0000-0003-4110-0748; Nederbragt, Alexander/0000-0001-5539-0999; Gjoen, Tor /0000-0003-4040-5793; Lanzen, Anders/0000-0002-7138-6364; Hongro Solbakken, Monica/0000-0002-9677-403X; Nepal, Chirag/0000-0001-8402-3805; Grimholt, Unni/0000-0002-0202-8061; Edvardsen, Rolf/0000-0001-8430-8042; Rounge, Trine/0000-0003-2677-2722",Research Council of Norway,"This work was supported by a grant from the Research Council of Norway (FUGE program) to K.S.J.

Most cases of ALS are sporadic but about 5-10% are familial. Mutations in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1)(1,2), TAR DNA-binding protein (TARDBP, also known as TDP43)(3,4) and fused in sarcoma (FUS, also known as translocated in liposarcoma (TLS))(5,6) account for approximately 30% of classic familial ALS. Mutations in several other genes have also been reported as rare causes of ALS or ALS-like syndromes(7-15). The causes of the remaining cases of familial ALS and of the vast majority of sporadic ALS are unknown. Despite extensive studies of previously identified ALS-causing genes, the pathogenic mechanism underlying motor-neuron degeneration in ALS remains largely obscure. Dementia, usually of the frontotemporal lobar type, may occur in some ALS cases. It is unclear whether ALS and dementia share common aetiology and pathogenesis in ALS/dementia. Here we show that mutations in UBQLN2, which encodes the ubiquitin-like protein ubiquilin 2, cause dominantly inherited, chromosome-X-linked ALS and ALS/dementia. We describe novel ubiquilin 2 pathology in the spinal cords of ALS cases and in the brains of ALS/dementia cases with or without UBQLN2 mutations. Ubiquilin 2 is a member of the ubiquilin family, which regulates the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. Functional analysis showed that mutations in UBQLN2 lead to an impairment of protein degradation. Therefore, our findings link abnormalities in ubiquilin 2 to defects in the protein degradation pathway, abnormal protein aggregation and neurodegeneration, indicating a common pathogenic mechanism that can be exploited for therapeutic intervention.","[Deng, Han-Xiang; Chen, Wenjie; Hong, Seong-Tshool; Gorrie, George H.; Siddique, Nailah; Yang, Yi; Fecto, Faisal; Shi, Yong; Zhai, Hong; Jiang, Hujun; Hirano, Makito; Donkervoort, Sandra; Ajroud, Kaouther; Sufit, Robert L.; Siddique, Teepu] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Davee Dept Neurol & Clin Neurosci, Div Neuromuscular Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Boycott, Kym M.] Childrens Hosp Eastern Ontario, Res Inst, Ottawa, ON K1H 8L1, Canada; [Boycott, Kym M.] Univ Ottawa, Dept Pediat, Ottawa, ON K1H 8L1, Canada; [Fecto, Faisal; Mugnaini, Enrico; Siddique, Teepu] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Interdept Neurosci Program, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Rampersaud, Evadnie; Pericak-Vance, Margaret A.] Univ Miami, Miller Sch Med, John P Hussman Inst Human Genom, Miami, FL 33136 USA; [Jansen, Gerard H.] Ottawa Hosp, Div Anat Pathol, Ottawa, ON K1Y 4E9, Canada; [Bigio, Eileen H.] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Div Neuropathol, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Brooks, Benjamin R.] Carolinas Med Ctr, Dept Neurol, Neurosci & Spine Inst, Charlotte, NC 28207 USA; [Haines, Jonathan L.] Vanderbilt Univ, Ctr Human Genet Res, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [Mugnaini, Enrico; Siddique, Teepu] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Dept Cell & Mol Biol, Chicago, IL 60611 USA","Siddique, T (reprint author), Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Davee Dept Neurol & Clin Neurosci, Div Neuromuscular Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA.",t-siddique@northwestern.edu,"Haines, Jonathan/C-3374-2012",,National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke [NS050641]; Les Turner ALS Foundation; Vena E.

Activated T cells undergo migrational imprinting within the draining lymph nodes(1), resulting in memory T cells that provide local and systemic protection(2). Combinations of migrating and resident memory T cells have been implicated in long-term peripheral immunity, especially at the surfaces that form pathogen entry points into the body(3). However, T-cell immunity consists of separate CD4(+) helper T cells and CD8(+) killer T cells, with distinct effector and memory programming requirements(4). Whether these subsets also differ in their ability to form a migrating pool involved in peripheral immunosurveillance or a separate resident population responsible for local infection control has not been explored. Here, using mice, we show key differences in the migration and tissue localization of memory CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells following infection of the skin by herpes simplex virus. On resolution of infection, the skin contained two distinct virus-specific memory subsets; a slow-moving population of sequestered CD8(+) T cells that were resident in the epidermis and confined largely to the original site of infection, and a dynamic population of CD4(+) T cells that trafficked rapidly through the dermis as part of a wider recirculation pattern. Unique homing-molecule expression by recirculating CD4(+) T effector-memory cells mirrored their preferential skin-migratory capacity. Overall, these results identify a complexity in memory T-cell migration, illuminating previously unappreciated differences between the CD4(+) and CD8(+) subsets.","[Gebhardt, Thomas; Whitney, Paul G.; Zaid, Ali; Mackay, Laura K.; Brooks, Andrew G.; Heath, William R.; Carbone, Francis R.; Mueller, Scott N.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia","Gebhardt, T (reprint author), Univ Melbourne, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",gebhardt@unimelb.edu.au; smue@unimelb.edu.au,"Mueller, Scott/B-1918-2012","Mueller, Scott/0000-0002-3838-3989; Gebhardt, Thomas/0000-0002-3768-9468; Brooks, Andrew/0000-0002-4085-9683; Mackay, Laura/0000-0002-8496-6632; Heath, William/0000-0001-9670-259X",Australian NHMRC; ARC,We thank members of the Carbone and Heath laboratories for discussions.

Efficient clearance depends on the capacity of a single phagocyte to ingest multiple apoptotic cells successively, and to process the corpse-derived cellular material(6). However, the factors that influence continued clearance by phagocytes are not known. Here we show that the mitochondrial membrane potential of the phagocyte critically controls engulfment capacity, with lower potential enhancing engulfment and vice versa. The mitochondrial membrane protein Ucp2, which acts to lower the mitochondrial membrane potential(7-9), was upregulated in phagocytes engulfing apoptotic cells. Loss of Ucp2 reduced phagocytic capacity, whereas Ucp2 overexpression enhanced engulfment. Mutational and pharmacological studies indicated a direct role for Ucp2-mediated mitochondrial function in phagocytosis. Macrophages from Ucp2-deficient mice(10,11) were impaired in phagocytosis in vitro, and Ucp2-deficient mice showed profound in vivo defects in clearing dying cells in the thymus and testes. Collectively, these data indicate that mitochondrial membrane potential and Ucp2 are key molecular determinants of apoptotic cell clearance. As Ucp2 is linked to metabolic diseases and atherosclerosis(11,12), this newly discovered role for Ucp2 in apoptotic cell clearance has implications for the complex aetiology and pathogenesis of these diseases.","[Park, Daeho; Han, Claudia Z.; Elliott, Michael R.; Kinchen, Jason M.; Trampont, Paul C.; Ravichandran, Kodi S.] Univ Virginia, Ctr Cell Clearance, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Park, Daeho; Han, Claudia Z.; Elliott, Michael R.; Kinchen, Jason M.; Trampont, Paul C.; Ravichandran, Kodi S.] Univ Virginia, Beirne B Carter Ctr Immunol Res, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Han, Claudia Z.; Kinchen, Jason M.; Ravichandran, Kodi S.] Univ Virginia, Dept Microbiol, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Das, Soumita] Univ Virginia, Dept Med, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Collins, Sheila] Sanford Burnham Med Res Inst, Diabet & Obes Res Ctr, Orlando, FL 32827 USA; [Lysiak, Jeffrey J.] Univ Virginia, Dept Urol, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Hoehn, Kyle L.] Univ Virginia, Dept Pharmacol, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Hoehn, Kyle L.] Univ Virginia, CVRC, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA","Ravichandran, KS (reprint author), Univ Virginia, Ctr Cell Clearance, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA.",ravi@virginia.edu,,"Elliott, Michael/0000-0002-0642-482X; Hoehn, Kyle/0000-0002-0214-3238",National Institute of General Medical Sciences; National Institute of Child Health and Development; American Heart Association,"We thank M.

Germline mutations of FH are responsible for hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal-cell cancer (HLRCC)(1). It has previously been demonstrated that the absence of FH leads to the accumulation of fumarate, which activates hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) at normal oxygen tensions(2-4). However, so far no mechanism that explains the ability of cells to survive without a functional TCA cycle has been provided. Here we use newly characterized genetically modified kidney mouse cells in which Fh1 has been deleted, and apply a newly developed computer model of the metabolism of these cells to predict and experimentally validate a linear metabolic pathway beginning with glutamine uptake and ending with bilirubin excretion from Fh1-deficient cells. This pathway, which involves the biosynthesis and degradation of haem, enables Fh1-deficient cells to use the accumulated TCA cycle metabolites and permits partial mitochondrial NADH production. We predicted and confirmed that targeting this pathway would render Fh1-deficient cells nonviable, while sparing wild-type Fh1-containing cells. This work goes beyond identifying a metabolic pathway that is induced in Fh1-deficient cells to demonstrate that inhibition of haem oxygenation is synthetically lethal when combined with Fh1 deficiency, providing a new potential target for treating HLRCC patients.","[Frezza, Christian; Zheng, Liang; MacKenzie, Elaine D.; Chaneton, Barbara; Hedley, Ann; Kalna, Gabriela; Gottlieb, Eyal] Beatson Inst Canc Res, Canc Res UK, Glasgow G61 1BD, Lanark, Scotland; [Folger, Ori; Jerby, Livnat; Ruppin, Eytan] Tel Aviv Univ, Blavatnik Sch Comp Sci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Rajagopalan, Kartik N.; Deberardinis, Ralph J.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Pediat, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Rajagopalan, Kartik N.; Deberardinis, Ralph J.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, McDermott Ctr Human Growth & Dev, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Micaroni, Massimo] Univ Queensland, Inst Mol Biosci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Tomlinson, Ian P.

Polymorphisms in the gene encoding the cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) are associated with the development of multiple allergic disorders in humans, indicating that TSLP is a critical regulator of T(H)2 cytokine-associated inflammatory diseases(3-6). In support of genetic analyses, exaggerated TSLP production is associated with asthma, atopic dermatitis and food allergies in patients, and studies in murine systems demonstrated that TSLP promotes T(H)2 cytokine-mediated immunity and inflammation(5,7-12). However, the mechanisms through which TSLP induces T(H)2 cytokine responses remain poorly defined. Here we demonstrate that TSLP promotes systemic basophilia, that disruption of TSLP-TSLPR interactions results in defective basophil responses, and that TSLPR-sufficient basophils can restore T(H)2-cell-dependent immunity in vivo. TSLP acted directly on bone-marrow-resident progenitors to promote basophil responses selectively. Critically, TSLP could elicit basophil responses in both IL-3-IL-3R-sufficient and -deficient environments, and genome-wide transcriptional profiling and functional analyses identified heterogeneity between TSLP-elicited versus IL-3-elicited basophils. Furthermore, activated human basophils expressed TSLPR, and basophils isolated from eosinophilic oesophagitis patients were distinct from classical basophils. Collectively, these studies identify previously unrecognized heterogeneity within the basophil cell lineage and indicate that expression of TSLP may influence susceptibility to multiple allergic diseases by regulating basophil haematopoiesis and eliciting a population of functionally distinct basophils that promote T(H)2 cytokine-mediated inflammation.","[Siracusa, Mark C.; Saenz, Steven A.; Hill, David A.; Kim, Brian S.; Doering, Travis A.; Wherry, E.

It has an ozone-depleting potential similar to that of hydrochlorofluorocarbons as well as a global warming potential exceeding that of CO2 300-fold(1,2). In bacterial denitrification, N2O is reduced to N-2 by the copper-dependent nitrous oxide reductase (N2OR)(3). This enzyme carries the mixed-valent Cu-A centre and the unique, tetranuclear Cu-Z site. Previous structural data were obtained with enzyme isolated in the presence of air that is catalytically inactive without prior reduction. Its Cu-Z site was described as a [4Cu:S] centre, and the substrate-binding mode and reduction mechanism remained elusive. Here we report the structure of purple N2OR from Pseudomonas stutzeri, handled under the exclusion of dioxygen, and locate the substrate in N2O-pressurized crystals. The active Cu-Z cluster contains two sulphur atoms, yielding a [4Cu:2S] stoichiometry; and N2O bound side-on at Cu-Z, in close proximity to Cu-A. With the substrate located between the two clusters, electrons are transferred directly from Cu-A to N2O, which is activated by side-on binding in a specific binding pocket on the face of the [4Cu:2S] centre. These results reconcile a multitude of available biochemical data on N2OR that could not be explained by earlier structures, and outline a mechanistic pathway in which both metal centres and the intervening protein act in concert to achieve catalysis. This structure represents the first direct observation, to our knowledge, of N2O bound to its reductase, and sheds light on the functionality of metalloenzymes that activate inert small-molecule substrates. The principle of using distinct clusters for substrate activation and for reduction may be relevant for similar systems, in particular nitrogen-fixing nitrogenase(4).","[Pomowski, Anja; Einsle, Oliver] Univ Freiburg, Inst Organ Chem & Biochem, Lehrstuhl Biochem, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Zumft, Walter G.] Karlsruher Inst Technol, Abt Mol Mikrobiol, Inst Angew Biowissensch, D-76187 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Kroneck, Peter M.

Associations with metabolic traits as functional intermediates can overcome these problems and potentially inform individualized therapy. Here we report a comprehensive analysis of genotype-dependent metabolic phenotypes using a GWAS with non-targeted metabolomics. We identified 37 genetic loci associated with blood metabolite concentrations, of which 25 show effect sizes that are unusually high for GWAS and account for 10-60% differences in metabolite levels per allele copy. Our associations provide new functional insights for many disease-related associations that have been reported in previous studies, including those for cardiovascular and kidney disorders, type 2 diabetes, cancer, gout, venous thromboembolism and Crohn's disease. The study advances our knowledge of the genetic basis of metabolic individuality in humans and generates many new hypotheses for biomedical and pharmaceutical research.","[Suhre, Karsten; Waegele, Brigitte;

Although a basic framework for TA protein recognition is now emerging, the decisive targeting and membrane insertion steps are not understood. Here we reconstitute the TA protein insertion cycle with purified components, present crystal structures of key complexes between these components and perform mutational analyses based on the structures. We show that a committed targeting complex, formed by a TA protein bound to the chaperone ATPase Get3, is initially recruited to the membrane through an interaction with Get2. Once the targeting complex has been recruited, Get1 interacts with Get3 to drive TA protein release in an ATPase-dependent reaction. After releasing its TA protein cargo, the now-vacant Get3 recycles back to the cytosol concomitant with ATP binding.

The mass fraction of elements more massive than helium, Z, is known as 'metallicity'. A number of very metal-poor stars has been found(2,3), some of which have a low iron abundance but are rich in carbon, nitrogen and oxygen(4-6). For theoretical reasons(7,8) and because of an observed absence of stars with Z<1.5x10(-5), it has been suggested that low-mass stars cannot form from the primitive interstellar medium until it has been enriched above a critical value of Z, estimated to lie in the range 1.5x10(-8) to 1.5x10(-6) (ref. 8), although competing theories claiming the contrary do exist(9). (We use 'low-mass' here to mean a stellar mass of less than 0.8 solar masses, the stars that survive to the present day.) Here we report the chemical composition of a star in the Galactic halo with a very low Z (<= 6.9x10(-7), which is 4.5x10(-5) times that of the Sun(10)) and a chemical pattern typical of classical extremely metal-poor stars(2,3)-that is, without enrichment of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. This shows that low-mass stars can be formed at very low metallicity, that is, below the critical value of Z. Lithium is not detected, suggesting a low-metallicity extension of the previously observed trend in lithium depletion(11). Such lithium depletion implies that the stellar material must have experienced temperatures above two million kelvin in its history, given that this is necessary to destroy lithium.","[Caffau, Elisabetta; Sbordone, Luca; Ludwig, Hans-G.] Univ Heidelberg, Zentrum Astron, Landessternwarte, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Caffau, Elisabetta; Bonifacio, Piercarlo; Francois, Patrick; Sbordone, Luca; Spite, Monique; Spite, Francois; Ludwig, Hans-G.; Cayrel, Roger; Hammer, Francois] Univ Paris Diderot, CNRS, Observ Paris, GEPI, F-92190 Meudon, France; [Francois, Patrick] Univ Picardie Jules Verne, UPJV, F-80080 Amiens, France; [Sbordone, Luca] Max Planck Inst Astrophys, D-85741 Garching, Germany; [Monaco, Lorenzo] European So Observ, Santiago 19, Chile; [Zaggia, Simone] Osserv Astron Padova, Ist Nazl Astrofis, I-35122 Padua, Italy; [Randich, Sofia] Osserv Astrofis Arcetri, Ist Nazl Astrofis, I-50125 Florence, Italy; [Molaro, Paolo] Osserv Astron Trieste, Ist Nazl Astrofis, I-34143 Trieste, Italy; [Hill, Vanessa] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, Observ Cote Azur, CNRS, Lab Cassiopee, F-06300 Nice, France","Caffau, E (reprint author), Univ Heidelberg, Zentrum Astron, Landessternwarte, Konigstuhl 12, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany.",Elisabetta.Caffau@obspm.fr,,"Randich, Sofia/0000-0003-2438-0899; Zaggia, Simone/0000-0001-6081-379X; Sbordone, Luca/0000-0002-2285-8708; Molaro, Paolo/0000-0002-0571-4163",,,,29,178,179,1,15,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Sep,2011,477,7362,,,,,67,69,,10.1038/nature10377,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,813XT,WOS:000294404300031,21886158.0,No,,,11/20/17,vanessa,hill,female,1,2704,na,na

The Earth's Moon is the archetypical example of this type of differentiation. Evidence for a lunar magma ocean is derived largely from the widespread distribution, compositional and mineralogical characteristics, and ancient ages inferred for the ferroan anorthosite (FAN) suite of lunar crustal rocks. The FANs are considered to be primary lunar flotation-cumulate crust that crystallized in the latter stages of magma ocean solidification. According to this theory, FANs represent the oldest lunar crustal rock type(2-4). Attempts to date this rock suite have yielded ambiguous results, however, because individual isochron measurements are typically incompatible with the geochemical make-up of the samples, and have not been confirmed by additional isotopic systems(5-9). By making improvements to the standard isotopic techniques, we report here the age of crystallization of FAN 60025 using the (207)Pb-(206)Pb, (147)Sm-(143)Nd and (146)Sm-(142)Nd isotopic systems to be 4,360 +/- 3 million years. This extraordinarily young age requires that either the Moon solidified significantly later than most previous estimates or the long-held assumption that FANs are flotation cumulates of a primordial magma ocean is incorrect. If the latter is correct, then much of the lunar crust may have been produced by non-magma-ocean processes, such as serial magmatism(10).","[Borg, Lars E.] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Div Chem Sci, Livermore, CA 94550 USA; [Connelly, James N.] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Star & Planet Format, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Boyet, Maud] Univ Clermont Ferrand, Clermont Univ, Lab Magmas & Volcans, UMR CNRS 6524, F-63038 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Carlson, Richard W.] Carnegie Inst Washington, Dept Terr Magnetism, Washington, DC 20015 USA","Borg, LE (reprint author), Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Div Chem Sci, 7000 East Ave L-231, Livermore, CA 94550 USA.",borg5@llnl.gov,"Connelly, James /O-7996-2015",,"US Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory [DE-AC52-07NA27344]; NASA [NNH08ZDA001N, NNX08AH65G]; Danish National Research Foundation; University of Copenhagen","This work was performed under the auspices of the US Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under contract number DE-AC52-07NA27344.

A controller compares the signal measured by a sensor (system output) with the target value or set-point. It then adjusts an actuator (system input) to stabilize the signal around the target value. Generalizing this scheme to stabilize a micro-system's quantum state relies on quantum feedback(1-3), which must overcome a fundamental difficulty: the sensor measurements cause a random back-action on the system. An optimal compromise uses weak measurements(4,5), providing partial information with minimal perturbation. The controller should include the effect of this perturbation in the computation of the actuator's operation, which brings the incrementally perturbed state closer to the target. Although some aspects of this scenario have been experimentally demonstrated for the control of quantum(6-9) or classical(10,11) micro-system variables, continuous feedback loop operations that permanently stabilize quantum systems around a target state have not yet been realized. Here we have implemented such a real-time stabilizing quantum feedback scheme(12) following a method inspired by ref. 13. It prepares on demand photon number states (Fock states) of a microwave field in a superconducting cavity, and subsequently reverses the effects of decoherence-induced field quantum jumps(14-16). The sensor is a beam of atoms crossing the cavity, which repeatedly performs weak quantum non-demolition measurements of the photon number(14). The controller is implemented in a real-time computer commanding the actuator, which injects adjusted small classical fields into the cavity between measurements. The microwave field is a quantum oscillator usable as a quantum memory(17) or as a quantum bus swapping information between atoms(18). Our experiment demonstrates that active control can generate non-classical states of this oscillator and combat their decoherence(15,16), and is a significant step towards the implementation of complex quantum information operations.","[Sayrin, Clement; Dotsenko, Igor; Zhou, Xingxing; Peaudecerf, Bruno; Rybarczyk, Theo; Gleyzes, Sebastien; Brune, Michel; Raimond, Jean-Michel; Haroche, Serge] UPMC Paris 6, ENS, CNRS, Lab Kastler Brossel, F-75005 Paris, France; [Rouchon, Pierre; Amini, Hadis] Mines ParisTech, Ctr Automat & Syst Math & Syst, F-75272 Paris 6, France; [Mirrahimi, Mazyar] INRIA Paris Rocquencourt, F-78153 Le Chesnay, France; [Haroche, Serge] Coll France, F-75231 Paris 05, France","Haroche, S (reprint author), UPMC Paris 6, ENS, CNRS, Lab Kastler Brossel, 24 Rue Lhomond, F-75005 Paris, France.",haroche@lkb.ens.fr,,"Sayrin, Clement/0000-0002-9747-5912",Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR); EU; ERC,"This work was supported by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) under the projects QUSCO-INCA, EPOQ2 and CQUID, and by the EU under the IP project AQUTE and ERC project DECLIC.",,30,199,200,2,85,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Sep,2011,477,7362,,,,,73,77,,10.1038/nature10376,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,813XT,WOS:000294404300033,21886159.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,serge,haroche,male,1,213,na,na

Understanding input pathways of bioavailable N is therefore paramount for predicting carbon (C) storage on land, particularly in temperate and boreal forests(3,4). Paradigms of nutrient cycling and limitation posit that new N enters terrestrial ecosystems solely from the atmosphere. Here we show that bedrock comprises a hitherto overlooked source of ecologically available N to forests. We report that the N content of soils and forest foliage on N-rich metasedimentary rocks (350-950 mg N kg(-1)) is elevated by more than 50% compared with similar temperate forest sites underlain by N-poor igneous parent material (30-70 mg N kg(-1)). Natural abundance N isotopes attribute this difference to rock-derived N: (15)N/(14)N values for rock, soils and plants are indistinguishable in sites underlain by N-rich lithology, in marked contrast to sites on N-poor substrates. Furthermore, forests associated with N-rich parent material contain on average 42% more carbon in above-ground tree biomass and 60% more carbon in the upper 30 cm of the soil than similar sites underlain by N-poor rocks. Our results raise the possibility that bedrock N input may represent an important and overlooked component of ecosystem N and C cycling elsewhere.","[Morford, Scott L.; Houlton, Benjamin Z.; Dahlgren, Randy A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Land Air & Water Resources, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Morford, SL (reprint author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Land Air & Water Resources, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",slmorford@ucdavis.edu,,"Houlton, Benjamin/0000-0002-1414-0261",David and Lucile Packard Foundation; Andrew W.

It probably originated in Africa, spreading to Europe and Asia perhaps as early as similar to 1 million years (Myr) ago(4-6). The origin of the Acheulian is thought to have closely coincided with major changes in human brain evolution, allowing for further technological developments(7,8). Nonetheless, the emergence of the Acheulian remains unclear because well-dated sites older than 1.4 Myr ago are scarce. Here we report on the lithic assemblage and geological context for the Kokiselei 4 archaeological site from the Nachukui formation (West Turkana, Kenya) that bears characteristic early Acheulian tools and pushes the first appearance datum for this stone-age technology back to 1.76 Myr ago. Moreover, co-occurrence of Oldowan and Acheulian artefacts at the Kokiselei site complex indicates that the two technologies are not mutually exclusive time-successive components of an evolving cultural lineage, and suggests that the Acheulian was either imported from another location yet to be identified or originated from Oldowan hominins at this vicinity. In either case, the Acheulian did not accompany the first human dispersal from Africa(9,10) despite being available at the time. This may indicate that multiple groups of hominins distinguished by separate stone-tool-making behaviours and dispersal strategies coexisted in Africa at 1.76 Myr ago.","[Lepre, Christopher J.; Kent, Dennis V.] Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Lepre, Christopher J.; Kent, Dennis V.; Quinn, Rhonda L.; Feibel, Craig S.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; [Roche, Helene; Harmand, Sonia] Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre, UMR CNRS 7055, F-92023 Nanterre, France; [Quinn, Rhonda L.] Seton Hall Univ, Dept Sociol Anthropol & Social Work, S Orange, NJ 07079 USA; [Brugal, Jean-Philippe] Maison Mediterraneenne Sci Homme, UMR CNRS 6636, F-13094 Aix En Provence 2, France; [Texier, Pierre-Jean; Lenoble, Arnaud] Univ Bordeaux 1, UMR CNRS PACEA 5199, F-33405 Talence, France","Lepre, CJ (reprint author), Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA.",lepre@ldeo.columbia.edu,,"Kent, Dennis/0000-0002-7677-2993",French Ministry of Foreign Affairs; National Science Foundation [BCS 02-18511],"We thank the office of the President of Kenya and the National Museums of Kenya for permission to conduct this research, TOTAL Kenya for logistical support, and the WTAP team.

Despite the imposition of strict management measures in force since the early 1990s, the Scotian Shelf ecosystem has not reverted back to its former structure. Here we provide evidence of the transient nature of this ecosystem and its current return path towards benthic fish species domination. The prolonged duration of the altered food web, and its current recovery, was and is being governed by the oscillatory, runaway consumption dynamics of the forage fish complex. These erupting forage species, which reached biomass levels 900% greater than those prevalent during the pre-collapse years of large benthic predators, are now in decline, having outstripped their zooplankton food supply. This dampening, and the associated reduction in the intensity of predation, was accompanied by lagged increases in species abundances at both lower and higher trophic levels, first witnessed in zooplankton and then in large-bodied predators, all consistent with a return towards the earlier ecosystem structure. We conclude that the reversibility of perturbed ecosystems can occur and that this bodes well for other collapsed fisheries.","[Frank, Kenneth T.; Petrie, Brian] Bedford Inst Oceanog, Ocean Sci Div, Dartmouth, NS B2Y 4A2, Canada; [Fisher, Jonathan A.

Interestingly, such impairments can be ameliorated through systemic perturbations such as exercise(1). Here, using heterochronic parabiosis we show that blood-borne factors present in the systemic milieu can inhibit or promote adult neurogenesis in an age-dependent fashion in mice. Accordingly, exposing a young mouse to an old systemic environment or to plasma from old mice decreased synaptic plasticity, and impaired contextual fear conditioning and spatial learning and memory. We identify chemokines-including CCL11 (also known as eotaxin)-the plasma levels of which correlate with reduced neurogenesis in heterochronic parabionts and aged mice, and the levels of which are increased in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of healthy ageing humans. Lastly, increasing peripheral CCL11 chemokine levels in vivo in young mice decreased adult neurogenesis and impaired learning and memory. Together our data indicate that the decline in neurogenesis and cognitive impairments observed during ageing can be in part attributed to changes in blood-borne factors.","[Villeda, Saul A.; Luo, Jian; Mosher, Kira I.; Britschgi, Markus; Bieri, Gregor; Stan, Trisha M.; Fainberg, Nina; Ding, Zhaoqing; Eggel, Alexander; Lucin, Kurt M.; Czirr, Eva; Park, Jeong-Soo; Rando, Thomas A.; Wyss-Coray, Tony] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurol & Neurol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Villeda, Saul A.; Mosher, Kira I.; Wyss-Coray, Tony] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Neurosci IDP Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Zou, Bende; Xie, Xinmin S.] AfaSci Res Lab, Redwood City, CA 94063 USA; [Bieri, Gregor] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Sch Life Sci, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Stan, Trisha M.; Ding, Zhaoqing; Wyss-Coray, Tony] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Immunol IDP Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Couillard-Despres, Sebastien; Aigner, Ludwig] Paracelsus Med Univ, Inst Mol Regenerat Med, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria; [Li, Ge; Peskind, Elaine R.] Univ Washington, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Seattle, WA 98108 USA; [Peskind, Elaine R.] Vet Affairs NW Network Mental Illness Res Educ &, Seattle, WA 98108 USA; [Kaye, Jeffrey A.; Quinn, Joseph F.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Layton Aging & Alzheimers Dis Ctr, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Kaye, Jeffrey A.; Quinn, Joseph F.] Portland VA Med Ctr, Portland, OR 97207 USA; [Galasko, Douglas R.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Neurosci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Rando, Thomas A.; Wyss-Coray, Tony] VA Palo Alto Hlth Care Syst, Ctr Tissue Regenerat Repair & Restorat, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA; [Rando, Thomas A.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Glenn Labs Biol Aging, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Wyss-Coray, T (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurol & Neurol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",twc@stanford.edu,"Luo, Jian/B-8449-2014","Luo, Jian/0000-0002-2064-8467; Eggel, Alexander/0000-0001-8746-3339; Britschgi, Markus/0000-0001-6151-4257; Kaye, Jeffrey/0000-0002-9971-3478","Department of Veterans Affairs; National Institutes of Health Institute on Aging [R01 AG027505, P30AG08017]; California Initiative for Regenerative Medicine; National Institutes of Health [R01 MH078194]; Larry L.

Here we explore a novel mechanism for ongoing HIV replication in the face of antiretroviral drugs. We propose a model whereby multiple infections(2,3) per cell lead to reduced sensitivity to drugs without requiring drug-resistant mutations, and experimentally validate the model using multiple infections per cell by cell-free HIV in the presence of the drug tenofovir. We then examine the drug sensitivity of cell-to-cell spread of HIV(4-7), a mode of HIV transmission that can lead to multiple infection events per target cell(8-10). Infections originating from cell-free virus decrease strongly in the presence of antiretrovirals tenofovir and efavirenz whereas infections involving cell-to-cell spread are markedly less sensitive to the drugs. The reduction in sensitivity is sufficient to keep multiple rounds of infection from terminating in the presence of drugs. We examine replication from cell-to-cell spread in the presence of clinical drug concentrations using a stochastic infection model and find that replication is intermittent, without substantial accumulation of mutations. If cell-to-cell spread has the same properties in vivo, it may have adverse consequences for the immune system(11-13), lead to therapy failure in individuals with risk factors(14), and potentially contribute to viral persistence and hence be a barrier to curing HIV infection.","[Sigal, Alex; Kim, Jocelyn T.; Balazs, Alejandro B.; Baltimore, David] CALTECH, Div Biol, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Kim, Jocelyn T.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Infect Dis, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Dekel, Erez; Mayo, Avi] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Mol Cell Biol, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Milo, Ron] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Plant Sci, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel","Baltimore, D (reprint author), CALTECH, Div Biol, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",baltimo@caltech.edu,"MAYO, AVI/K-1736-2012","mayo, avi/0000-0002-4479-3423",Human Frontier Science Program [LT00946]; UCLA [T32 AI089398]; amfAR Postdoctoral Research Fellowship [107756-47-RFVA]; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; National Institutes of Health [HHSN266200500035C]; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; UCLA CFAR Virology Core Lab [P01-AI-28697]; UCSF-GIVI CFAR [P30-AI-27763],"We thank B.

We hypothesized that a poxvirus, which evolved for blood-borne systemic spread in mammals, could be engineered for cancer-selective replication and used as a vehicle for the intravenous delivery and expression of transgenes in tumours. JX-594 is an oncolytic poxvirus engineered for replication, transgene expression and amplification in cancer cells harbouring activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/Ras pathway, followed by cell lysis and anticancer immunity(1). Here we show in a clinical trial that JX-594 selectively infects, replicates and expresses transgene products in cancer tissue after intravenous infusion, in a dose-related fashion.

In vitro studies have indicated that the Legionella protein DrrA post-translationally modifies the GTPase Rab1 by a process called AMPylation(7). Here we used mass spectrometry to investigate post-translational modifications to Rab1 that occur during infection of host cells by Legionella. Consistent with in vitro studies, DrrA-mediated AMPylation of a conserved tyrosine residue in the switch II region of Rab1 was detected during infection. In addition, a modification to an adjacent serine residue in Rab1 was discovered, which was independent of DrrA. The Legionella effector protein AnkX was required for this modification. Biochemical studies determined that AnkX directly mediates the covalent attachment of a phosphocholine moiety to Rab1. This phosphocholine transferase activity used CDP-choline as a substrate and required a conserved histidine residue located in the FIC domain of the AnkX protein. During infection, AnkX modified both Rab1 and Rab35, which explains how this protein modulates membrane transport through both the endocytic and exocytic pathways of the host cell. Thus, phosphocholination of Rab GTPases represents a mechanism by which bacterial FIC-domain-containing proteins can alter host-cell functions.","[Mukherjee, Shaeri; Liu, Xiaoyun; Arasaki, Kohei; McDonough, Justin; Galan, Jorge E.; Roy, Craig R.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Boyer Ctr Mol Med, Sect Microbial Pathogenesis, New Haven, CT 06536 USA","Roy, CR (reprint author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, Boyer Ctr Mol Med, Sect Microbial Pathogenesis, 295 Congress Ave, New Haven, CT 06536 USA.",craig.roy@yale.edu,,"Roy, Craig/0000-0003-4490-440X","Anna Fuller Fellowship; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [F32 AI082927, R01-AI064559, R01-AI048770]; Northeast Biodefense Center [U54-AI057158-Lipkin]","We thank E.

Growing evidence indicates a causative role of misfolded forms of the protein alpha-synuclein in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease(3,4). Intraneuronal aggregates of alpha-synuclein occur in Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites(5), the cytopathological hallmarks of Parkinson's disease and related disorders called synucleinopathies(4). alpha-Synuclein has long been defined as a 'natively unfolded' monomer of about 14 kDa (ref. 6) that is believed to acquire alpha-helical secondary structure only upon binding to lipid vesicles(7). This concept derives from the widespread use of recombinant bacterial expression protocols for in vitro studies, and of overexpression, sample heating and/or denaturing gels for cell culture and tissue studies. In contrast, we report that endogenous alpha-synuclein isolated and analysed under non-denaturing conditions from neuronal and non-neuronal cell lines, brain tissue and living human cells occurs in large part as a folded tetramer of about 58 kDa. Several methods, including analytical ultracentrifugation, scanning transmission electron microscopy and in vitro cell crosslinking confirmed the occurrence of the tetramer. Native, cell-derived alpha-synuclein showed alpha-helical structure without lipid addition and had much greater lipid-binding capacity than the recombinant alpha-synuclein studied heretofore. Whereas recombinantly expressed monomers readily aggregated intoamyloid-like fibrilsin vitro, native human tetramers underwent little or no amyloid-like aggregation. On the basis of these findings, we propose that destabilization of the helically folded tetramer precedes alpha-synuclein misfolding and aggregation in Parkinson's disease and other human synucleinopathies, and that small molecules that stabilize the physiological tetramer could reduce alpha-synuclein pathogenicity.","[Bartels, Tim; Choi, Joanna G.; Selkoe, Dennis J.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Ctr Neurol Dis, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Bartels, Tim; Choi, Joanna G.; Selkoe, Dennis J.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Selkoe, DJ (reprint author), Brigham & Womens Hosp, Ctr Neurol Dis, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",dselkoe@rics.bwh.harvard.edu,,,"NIH [NS051318, NS038375]","Mass measurements were carried out at the Brookhaven National Laboratory STEM facility, a user facility supported by the US Department of Energy.

However, a rigorous understanding of the relation between a protein's structure, dynamics and function remains elusive. This is because many of the conformers on its energy landscape are only transiently formed and marginally populated (less than a few per cent of the total number of molecules), so that they cannot be individually characterized by most biophysical tools. Here we study a lysozyme mutant from phage T4 that binds hydrophobic molecules(4) and populates an excited state transiently (about 1 ms) to about 3% at 25 degrees C (ref. 5). We show that such binding occurs only via the ground state, and present the atomic-level model of the 'invisible', excited state obtained using a combined strategy of relaxation-dispersion NMR (ref. 6) and CS-Rosetta(7) model building that rationalizes this observation. The model was tested using structure-based design calculations identifying point mutants predicted to stabilize the excited state relative to the ground state. In this way a pair of mutations were introduced, inverting the relative populations of the ground and excited states and altering function. Our results suggest a mechanism for the evolution of a protein's function by changing the delicate balance between the states on its energy landscape. More generally, they show that our approach can generate and validate models of excited protein states.","[Bouvignies, Guillaume; Vallurupalli, Pramodh; Hansen, D.

Repetitive sequences are especially at risk during meiosis, when numerous programmed DSBs are introduced into the genome to initiate meiotic recombination(1). In the repetitive ribosomal DNA (rDNA) array of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, meiotic DSB formation is prevented in part through Sir2-dependent heterochromatin formation(2,3). Here we show that the edges of the rDNA array are exceptionally susceptible to meiotic DSBs, revealing an inherent heterogeneity in the rDNA array. We find that this localized DSB susceptibility necessitates a border-specific protection system consisting of the meiotic ATPase Pch2 and the origin recognition complex subunit Orc1. Upon disruption of these factors, DSB formation and recombination increased specifically in the outermost rDNA repeats, leading to NAHR and rDNA instability. Notably, the Sir2-dependent heterochromatin of the rDNA itself was responsible for the induction of DSBs at the rDNA borders in pch2 Delta cells. Thus, although the activity of Sir2 globally prevents meiotic DSBs in the rDNA, it creates a highly permissive environment for DSB formation at the junctions between heterochromatin and euchromatin. Heterochromatinized repetitive DNA arrays are abundant in most eukaryotic genomes. Our data define the borders of such chromatin domains as distinct high-risk regions for meiotic NAHR, the protection of which may be a universal requirement to prevent meiotic genome rearrangements that are associated with genomic diseases and birth defects.","[Vader, Gerben; Blitzblau, Hannah G.; Tame, Mihoko A.; Falk, Jill E.; Curtin, Lisa; Hochwagen, Andreas] Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge Ctr 9, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Curtin, Lisa] Somerville High Sch, Somerville, MA 02143 USA","Hochwagen, A (reprint author), NYU, Dept Biol, 100 Washington Sq E, New York, NY 10003 USA.",andi@nyu.edu,,"Vader, Gerben/0000-0001-5729-0991; Falk, Jill/0000-0003-2910-9803; Hochwagen, Andreas/0000-0002-6184-443X","NIH [GM088248]; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research [NWO Rubicon-825.08.009, NWO VENI-016.111.004]; HHMI [52005879]","We thank S.

For decades it had been assumed that limb regeneration derived from the blastema, an undifferentiated pluripotent cell population thought to be derived from mature cells via dedifferentiation. Here we show that a wide range of tissue stem/progenitor cells contribute towards the restoration of the mouse distal digit. Genetic fate mapping and clonal analysis of individual cells revealed that these stem cells are lineage restricted, mimicking digit growth during development. Transplantation of cyan-fluorescent-protein-expressing haematopoietic stem cells, and parabiosis between genetically marked mice, confirmed that the stem/progenitor cells are tissue resident, including the cells involved in angiogenesis. These results, combined with those from appendage regeneration in other vertebrate subphyla, collectively demonstrate that tissue stem cells rather than pluripotent blastema cells are an evolutionarily conserved cellular mode for limb regeneration after amputation.","[Rinkevich, Yuval; Lindau, Paul; Ueno, Hiroo; Longaker, Michael T.; Weissman, Irving L.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Stanford Inst Stem Cell Biol & Regenerat Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Longaker, Michael T.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Surg Plast & Reconstruct Surg, Hagey Lab Pediat Regenerat Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Weissman, Irving L.] Stanford Univ, Ludwig Ctr Canc Stem Cell Res, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Rinkevich, Y (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Inst Stem Cell Biol & Regenerat Med, Lorry I Lokey Res Bldg, Stanford, CA 94028 USA.",ryuval@stanford.edu,,,California Institute of Regenerative Medicine [RC1 00354]; Smith Family Trust; Oak Foundation; Hagey Laboratory for Pediatric Regenerative Medicine; Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP); Machiah Foundation,"We thank A.

It has a central role in cellular energy production and has been implicated in many human neurodegenerative diseases. The L-shaped enzyme consists of hydrophilic and membrane domains. Previously, we determined the structure of the hydrophilic domain. Here we report the crystal structure of the Esherichia coli complex I membrane domain at 3.0 angstrom resolution. It includes six subunits, NuoL, NuoM, NuoN, NuoA, NuoJ and NuoK, with 55 transmembrane helices. The fold of the homologous antiporter-like subunits L, M and N is novel, with two inverted structural repeats of five transmembrane helices arranged, unusually, face-to-back. Each repeat includes a discontinuous transmembrane helix and forms half of a channel across the membrane. A network of conserved polar residues connects the two half-channels, completing the proton translocation pathway. Unexpectedly, lysines rather than carboxylate residues act as the main elements of the proton pump in these subunits. The fourth probable proton-translocation channel is at the interface of subunits N, K, J and A. The structure indicates that proton translocation in complex I, uniquely, involves coordinated conformational changes in six symmetrical structural elements.","[Efremov, Rouslan G.; Sazanov, Leonid A.] MRC, Mitochondrial Biol Unit, Cambridge CB2 0XY, England","Sazanov, LA (reprint author), MRC, Mitochondrial Biol Unit, Wellcome Trust MRC Bldg,Hills Rd, Cambridge CB2 0XY, England.",sazanov@mrc-mbu.cam.ac.uk,"Efremov, Rouslan/P-9085-2015","Efremov, Rouslan/0000-0001-7516-8658",Medical Research Council,This work was funded by the Medical Research Council.

The aftermath of this process may have been seen several times over the past two decades in the form of sparsely sampled, slowly fading emission from distant galaxies(8-14), but the onset of the stellar disruption event has not hitherto been observed. Here we report observations of a bright X-ray flare from the extragalactic transient Swift J164449.3+573451. This source increased in brightness in the X-ray band by a factor of at least 10,000 since 1990 and by a factor of at least 100 since early 2010. We conclude that we have captured the onset of relativistic jet activity from a supermassive black hole. A companion paper(15) comes to similar conclusions on the basis of radio observations. This event is probably due to the tidal disruption of a star falling into a supermassive black hole, but the detailed behaviour differs from current theoretical models of such events.","[Burrows, D.

Transient accretion onto a supermassive black hole, for example through the tidal disruption(2,3) of a stray star, thus offers a rare opportunity to study the birth of a relativistic jet. On 25 March 2011, an unusual transient source (Swift J164449.3+573451) was found(4), potentially representing(5,6) such an accretion event. Here we report observations spanning centimetre to millimetre wavelengths and covering the first month of evolution of a luminous radio transient associated with Swift J164449.3+573451. The radio transient coincides(7) with the nucleus of an inactive galaxy. We conclude that we are seeing a newly formed relativistic outflow, launched by transient accretion onto a million-solar-mass black hole. A relativistic outflow is not predicted in this situation, but we show that the tidal disruption of a star naturally explains the observed high-energy properties and radio luminosity and the inferred rate of such events. The weaker beaming in the radio-frequency spectrum relative to c-rays or X-rays suggests that radio searches may uncover similar events out to redshifts of z approximate to 6.","[Zauderer, B.

Model calculations suggest that almost half of the global cloud condensation nuclei in the atmospheric boundary layer may originate from the nucleation of aerosols from trace condensable vapours(4), although the sensitivity of the number of cloud condensation nuclei to changes of nucleation rate may be small(5,6). Despite extensive research, fundamental questions remain about the nucleation rate of sulphuric acid particles and the mechanisms responsible, including the roles of galactic cosmic rays and other chemical species such as ammonia(7). Here we present the first results from the CLOUD experiment at CERN. We find that atmospherically relevant ammonia mixing ratios of 100 parts per trillion by volume, or less, increase the nucleation rate of sulphuric acid particles more than 100-1,000-fold. Time-resolved molecular measurements reveal that nucleation proceeds by a base-stabilization mechanism involving the stepwise accretion of ammonia molecules. Ions increase the nucleation rate by an additional factor of between two and more than ten at ground-level galactic-cosmic-ray intensities, provided that the nucleation rate lies below the limiting ion-pair production rate. We find that ion-induced binary nucleation of H2SO4-H2O can occur in the midtroposphere but is negligible in the boundary layer. However, even with the large enhancements in rate due to ammonia and ions, atmospheric concentrations of ammonia and sulphuric acid are insufficient to account for observed boundary-layer nucleation.","[Curtius, Joachim; Almeida, Joao; Ehrhart, Sebastian; Ickes, Luisa; Kuerten, Andreas; Rondo, Linda; Wimmer, Daniela; Kreissl, Fabian] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Atmospher & Environm Sci, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany; [Almeida, Joao; Amorim, Antonio; Lima, Jorge; Mogo, Sandra; Pereira, Paulo; Tome, Antonio] Univ Lisbon, SIM, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal; [Almeida, Joao; Amorim, Antonio; Lima, Jorge; Mogo, Sandra; Pereira, Paulo; Tome, Antonio] Univ Beira Interior, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal; [Dunne, Eimear; Carslaw, Kenneth S.] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Duplissy, Jonathan; Franchin, Alessandro; Gagne, Stephanie; Schobesberger, Siegfried; Ehn, Mikael; Junninen, Heikki; Lehtipalo, Katrianne; Mikkila, Jyri; Nieminen, Tuomo; Petaja, Tuukka; Sipila, Mikko; Vanhanen, Joonas; Worsnop, Douglas R.; Kulmala, Markku] Univ Helsinki, Dept Phys, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Duplissy, Jonathan; Gagne, Stephanie; Sipila, Mikko] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki Inst Phys, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Kirkby, Jasper; Duplissy, Jonathan; David, Andre; Haider, Stefan; Mathot, Serge; Minginette, Pierre; Onnela, Antti] CERN, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Kupc, Agnieszka; Vrtala, Aron; Wagner, Paul E.; Winkler, Paul M.] Univ Vienna, Fac Phys, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Metzger, Axel; Breitenlechner, Martin; Hansel, Armin; Hauser, Daniel; Jud, Werner; Schnitzhofer, Ralf] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Ion & Appl Phys, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Metzger, Axel; Breitenlechner, Martin; Hansel, Armin; Hauser, Daniel; Jud, Werner; Schnitzhofer, Ralf] Ionicon Analyt GmbH, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Riccobono, Francesco; Bianchi, Federico; Dommen, Josef; Walther, Hansueli; Weingartner, Ernest; Baltensperger, Urs] Paul Scherrer Inst, Lab Atmospher Chem, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland; [Tsagkogeorgas, Georgios; Stratmann, Frank; Wex, Heike] Leibniz Inst Tropospher Res, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Bianchi, Federico] Univ Milan, Dept Inorgan Metallorgan & Analyt Chem, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Downard, Andrew; Flagan, Richard C.; Seinfeld, John H.] CALTECH, Div Chem & Chem Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Kvashin, Alexander; Makhmutov, Vladimir; Stozhkov, Yuri] PN Lebedev Phys Inst, Solar & Cosm Ray Res Lab, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Laaksonen, Ari] Univ Eastern Finland, FI-70211 Kuopio, Finland; [Lovejoy, Edward R.] NOAA, Earth Syst Res Lab, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; [Viisanen, Yrjo] Finnish Meteorol Inst, FI-00101 Helsinki, Finland; [Worsnop, Douglas R.] Aerodyne Res Inc, Billerica, MA 01821 USA","Kirkby, J (reprint author), CERN, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland.",jasper.kirkby@cern.ch,"; Weingartner, Ernest/B-6793-2009; Schobesberger, Siegfried/L-4454-2014; Stozhkov, Yuri/M-7433-2015; Sipila, Mikko/G-3024-2010; Hansel, Armin/F-3915-2010; Makhmutov, Vladimir/N-2086-2015; Kulmala, Markku/I-7671-2016; Ehn, Mikael/N-2571-2016; Bianchi, Federico/G-8428-2012; Duplissy, Jonathan/A-1723-2010; Worsnop, Douglas/D-2817-2009; Curtius, Joachim/A-2681-2011; Kirkby, Jasper/A-4973-2012; Nieminen, Tuomo/D-1618-2011; Tinoco Mendes, Andre David/D-4314-2011; Mogo, Sandra/B-6967-2008; Laaksonen, Ari/B-5094-2011; Tome, Antonio/A-5681-2013; Carslaw, Ken/C-8514-2009; Petaja, Tuukka/A-8009-2008; Franchin, Alessandro/K-1765-2013; Junninen, Heikki/C-2157-2014; Dunne, Eimear/H-1567-2014","Amorim, Antonio/0000-0003-0638-2321; Kurten, Andreas/0000-0002-8955-4450; Ickes, Luisa/0000-0001-8772-4164; Lehtipalo, Katrianne/0000-0002-1660-2706; Weingartner, Ernest/0000-0002-2427-4634; Schobesberger, Siegfried/0000-0002-5777-4897; Hansel, Armin/0000-0002-1062-2394; Kulmala, Markku/0000-0003-3464-7825; Ehn, Mikael/0000-0002-0215-4893; Bianchi, Federico/0000-0003-2996-3604; Duplissy, Jonathan/0000-0001-8819-0264; Worsnop, Douglas/0000-0002-8928-8017; Curtius, Joachim/0000-0003-3153-4630; Kirkby, Jasper/0000-0003-2341-9069; Tinoco Mendes, Andre David/0000-0001-5854-7699; Mogo, Sandra/0000-0002-1423-2668; Laaksonen, Ari/0000-0002-1657-2383; Tome, Antonio/0000-0001-9144-7120; Carslaw, Ken/0000-0002-6800-154X; Petaja, Tuukka/0000-0002-1881-9044; Junninen, Heikki/0000-0001-7178-9430; Dunne, Eimear/0000-0001-7085-8473","EC [215072]; ERC [227463]; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [01LK0902A]; Swiss National Science Foundation [206621_125025, 206620_130527]; Academy of Finland Center of Excellence [1118615]; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P19546, L593]; Russian Academy of Sciences; Russian Foundation for Basic Research [N08-02-91006-CERN]; CERN","We thank CERN for supporting CLOUD with important technical and financial resources, and for providing a particle beam from the CERN Proton Synchrotron.

The timescale of this recycling is important to our understanding of mantle circulation rates. Correlations of uranogenic lead isotopes in lavas from ocean islands such as Hawaii or Iceland, when interpreted as model isochrons, have yielded source differentiation ages between 1 and 2.5 billion years (Gyr)(2-5). However, if such correlations are produced by mixing of unrelated mantle components(6) they will have no direct age significance. Re-Os decay model ages take into account the mixing of sources with different histories(7,8), but they depend on the assumed initial Re/Os ratio of the subducted crust, which is poorly constrained because of the high mobility of rhenium during subduction(9). Here we report the first data on Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios for 138 melt inclusions in olivine phenocrysts from lavas of Mauna Loa shield volcano, Hawaii, indicating enormous mantle source heterogeneity. We show that highly radiogenic strontium in severely rubidium-depleted melt inclusions matches the isotopic composition of 200-650-Myr-old sea water. We infer that such sea water must have contaminated the Mauna Loa source rock, before subduction, imparting a unique 'time stamp' on this source. Small amounts of seawater-derived strontium in plume sources may be common but can be identified clearly only in ultra-depleted melts originating from generally highly (incompatible-element) depleted source components. The presence of 200-650-Myr-old oceanic crust in the source of Hawaiian lavas implies a timescale of general mantle circulation with an average rate of about 2 (+/- 1) cm yr(-1), much faster than previously thought.

Yet previous studies have not shown that violence can be attributed to the global climate, only that random weather events might be correlated with conflict in some cases(3-7). Here we directly associate planetary-scale climate changes with global patterns of civil conflict by examining the dominant interannual mode of the modern climate(8-10), the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Historians have argued that ENSO may have driven global patterns of civil conflict in the distant past(11-13), a hypothesis that we extend to the modern era and test quantitatively. Using data from 1950 to 2004, we show that the probability of new civil conflicts arising throughout the tropics doubles during El Nino years relative to La Nina years. This result, which indicates that ENSO may have had a role in 21% of all civil conflicts since 1950, is the first demonstration that the stability of modern societies relates strongly to the global climate.","[Cane, Mark A.] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Hsiang, Solomon M.; Meng, Kyle C.] Columbia Univ, Sch Int & Publ Affairs, New York, NY 10027 USA","Hsiang, SM (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",shsiang@princeton.edu,"Cane, Mark/I-8086-2012",,Environmental Protection Agency [FP-916932]; Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowship for New Americans; National Bureau of Economic Research,"S.M.H. was supported by Environmental Protection Agency Science to Achieve Results grant FP-916932 and a postdoctoral fellowship in Applied Econometrics at the National Bureau of Economic Research; K.

Aminostratigraphy is a method potentially able to link terrestrial sequences to the marine isotope stages (MIS) of the deep-sea record(1,2). We have used new methods of extraction and analysis of amino acids, preserved within the calcitic opercula of the freshwater gastropod Bithynia, to provide the most comprehensive data set for the British Pleistocene based on a single dating technique. A total of 470 opercula from 74 sites spanning the entire Quaternary are ranked in order of relative age based on the extent of protein degradation, using aspartic acid/asparagine (Asx), glutamic acid/glutamine (Glx), serine (Ser), alanine (Ala) and valine (Val). This new aminostratigraphy is consistent with the stratigraphical relationships of stratotypes, sites with independent geochronology, biostratigraphy and terrace stratigraphy(3-6). The method corroborates the existence of four interglacial stages between the Anglian (MIS 12) and the Holocene in the terrestrial succession. It establishes human occupation of Britain in most interglacial stages after MIS 15, but supports the notion of human absence during the Last Interglacial (MIS 5e)(7). Suspicions that the treeless 'optimum of the Upton Warren interstadial' at Isleworth pre-dates MIS 3 are confirmed. This new aminostratigraphy provides a robust framework against which climatic, biostratigraphical and archaeological models can be tested.","[Penkman, Kirsty E.

Disturbingly, the geographic range of dengue is currently expanding and the severity of outbreaks is increasing(2-4). Control options for dengue are very limited and currently focus on reducing population abundance of the major mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti(5,6). These strategies are failing to reduce dengue incidence in tropical communities and there is an urgent need for effective alternatives. It has been proposed that endosymbiotic bacterial Wolbachia infections of insects might be used in novel strategies for dengue control(7-9). For example, the wMelPop-CLA Wolbachia strain reduces the lifespan of adult A. aegypti mosquitoes in stably transinfected lines(8). This life-shortening phenotype was predicted to reduce the potential for dengue transmission. The recent discovery that several Wolbachia infections, including wMelPop-CLA, can also directly influence the susceptibility of insects to infection with a range of insect and human pathogens(9-11) has markedly changed the potential for Wolbachia infections to control human diseases. Here we describe the successful transinfection of A. aegypti with the avirulent wMel strain of Wolbachia, which induces the reproductive phenotype cytoplasmic incompatibility with minimal apparent fitness costs and high maternal transmission, providing optimal phenotypic effects for invasion. Under semi-field conditions, the wMel strain increased from an initial starting frequency of 0.65 to near fixation within a few generations, invading A. aegypti populations at an accelerated rate relative to trials with the wMelPop-CLA strain. We also show that wMel and wMelPop-CLA strains block transmission of dengue serotype 2 (DENV-2) in A. aegypti, forming the basis of a practical approach to dengue suppression(12).","[Walker, T.; Moreira, L.

Population transformation using the intracellular bacterium Wolbachia is particularly attractive because this maternally-inherited agent provides a powerful mechanism to invade natural populations through cytoplasmic incompatibility(2). When Wolbachia are introduced into mosquitoes, they interfere with pathogen transmission and influence key life history traits such as lifespan(3-6). Here we describe how the wMel Wolbachia infection, introduced into the dengue vector Aedes aegypti from Drosophila melanogaster(7), successfully invaded two natural A. aegypti populations in Australia, reaching near-fixation in a few months following releases of wMel-infected A. aegypti adults. Models with plausible parameter values indicate that Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes suffered relatively small fitness costs, leading to an unstable equilibrium frequency <30% that must be exceeded for invasion. These findings demonstrate that Wolbachia-based strategies can be deployed as a practical approach to dengue suppression with potential for area-wide implementation.","[Montgomery, B.

However, dysregulation of glucocorticoids is associated with cognitive impairments and depressive illness(1,2). In the hippocampus, a brain region densely populated with receptors for stress hormones, stress and glucocorticoids strongly inhibit adult neurogenesis(3). Decreased neurogenesis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of anxiety and depression, but direct evidence for this role is lacking(4,5). Here we show that adult-born hippocampal neurons are required for normal expression of the endocrine and behavioural components of the stress response. Using either transgenic or radiation methods to inhibit adult neurogenesis specifically, we find that glucocorticoid levels are slower to recover after moderate stress and are less suppressed by dexamethasone in neurogenesis-deficient mice than intact mice, consistent with a role for the hippocampus in regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis(6,7). Relative to controls, neurogenesis-deficient mice also showed increased food avoidance in a novel environment after acute stress, increased behavioural despair in the forced swim test, and decreased sucrose preference, a measure of anhedonia. These findings identify a small subset of neurons within the dentate gyrus that are critical for hippocampal negative control of the HPA axis and support a direct role for adult neurogenesis in depressive illness.","[Snyder, Jason S.; Soumier, Amelie; Brewer, Michelle; Pickel, James; Cameron, Heather A.] NIMH, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Cameron, HA (reprint author), NIMH, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",heathercameron@mail.nih.gov,"Snyder, Jason/F-3435-2011; Cameron, Heather/E-6221-2011","Cameron, Heather/0000-0002-3245-5777; Snyder, Jason/0000-0002-5509-0272","National Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes of Health, USA [ZIA MH002784]","We thank A.

Although studies of cytokinetic mechanics mostly focus on the equatorial constriction ring(3), a contractile actomyosin cortex is also present at the poles of dividing cells(2,4). Whether polar forces influence cytokinetic cell shape and furrow positioning remains an open question. Here we demonstrate that the polar cortex makes cytokinesis inherently unstable. We show that limited asymmetric polar contractions occur during cytokinesis, and that perturbing the polar cortex leads to cell shape oscillations, resulting in furrow displacement and aneuploidy. A theoretical model based on a competition between cortex turnover and contraction dynamics accurately accounts for the oscillations. We further propose that membrane blebs, which commonly form at the poles of dividing cells(5) and whose role in cytokinesis has long been enigmatic, stabilize cell shape by acting as valves releasing cortical contractility. Our findings reveal an inherent instability in the shape of the dividing cell and unveil a novel, spindle-independent mechanism ensuring the stability of cleavage furrow positioning.","[Sedzinski, Jakub; Biro, Mate; Oswald, Annelie; Tinevez, Jean-Yves; Paluch, Ewa] Max Planck Inst Mol Cell Biol & Genet, D-01307 Dresden, Germany; [Sedzinski, Jakub; Biro, Mate; Tinevez, Jean-Yves; Paluch, Ewa] Int Inst Mol & Cell Biol, PL-02109 Warsaw, Poland; [Salbreux, Guillaume] Max Planck Inst Phys Komplexer Syst, D-01187 Dresden, Germany","Paluch, E (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Mol Cell Biol & Genet, D-01307 Dresden, Germany.",paluch@mpi-cbg.de,"Biro, Mate/H-6292-2014; Tinevez, Jean-Yves/L-7581-2015; Tinevez, Jean-Yves/E-8398-2012","Biro, Mate/0000-0001-5852-3726; Tinevez, Jean-Yves/0000-0002-0998-4718; Tinevez, Jean-Yves/0000-0002-0998-4718; Sedzinski, Jakub/0000-0002-1788-0329; Salbreux, Guillaume/0000-0001-7041-1292",Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education; Max Planck Society,"We thank J.

There is growing evidence that cohesin also forms long-range chromosomal cis-interactions(2-4) and may regulate gene expression(2-10) in association with CTCF8,9, mediator(4) or tissue-specific transcription factors(10). Human cohesinopathies such as Cornelia de Lange syndrome are thought to result from impaired non-canonical cohesin functions(7), but a clear distinction between the cell-division-related and cell-division-independent functions of cohesion-as exemplified in Drosophila(11-13)-has not been demonstrated in vertebrate systems. To address this, here we deleted the cohesin locus Rad21 in mouse thymocytes at a time in development when these cells stop cycling and rearrange their T-cell receptor (TCR) a locus (Tcra). Rad21-deficient thymocytes had a normal lifespan and retained the ability to differentiate, albeit with reduced efficiency. Loss of Rad21 led to defective chromatin architecture at the Tcra locus, where cohesion-binding sites flank the TEA promoter and the Ea enhancer, and demarcate Tcra from interspersed Tcrd elements and neighbouring housekeeping genes. Cohesin was required for long-range promoter-enhancer interactions, Tcra transcription, H3K4me3 histone modifications that recruit the recombination machinery(14,15) and Tcra rearrangement. Provision of pre-rearranged TCR transgenes largely rescued thymocyte differentiation, demonstrating that among thousands of potential target genes across the genome(4,8-10), defective Tcra rearrangement was limiting for the differentiation of cohesin-deficient thymocytes. These findings firmly establish a cell-division-independent role for cohesin in Tcra locus rearrangement and provide a comprehensive account of the mechanisms by which cohesin enables cellular differentiation in a well-characterized mammalian system.","[Seitan, Vlad C.; Lavagnolli, Thais; Mira-Bontenbal, Hegias; Brown, Karen E.; Terry, Anna; Fisher, Amanda G.; Merkenschlager, Matthias] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, MRC, Clin Sci Ctr, Lymphocyte Dev Grp, London W12 0NN, England; [Seitan, Vlad C.; Aragon, Luis] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, MRC, Clin Sci Ctr, Cell Cycle Grp, London W12 0NN, England; [Seitan, Vlad C.; Lavagnolli, Thais; Mira-Bontenbal, Hegias; Brown, Karen E.; Carroll, Tom; Terry, Anna; Aragon, Luis; Fisher, Amanda G.; Merkenschlager, Matthias] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, MRC, Clin Sci Ctr, Epigenet Sect, London W12 0NN, England; [Hao, Bingtao; Krangel, Michael S.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Immunol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Tachibana-Konwalski, Kikue; Nasmyth, Kim] Univ Oxford, Dept Biochem, Oxford OX1 3QU, England; [Teng, Grace; Schatz, David G.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Immunobiol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Horan, Katie] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Cent Biol Serv, London W12 0NN, England; [Marks, Hendrik] Nijmegen Ctr Mol Life Sci, Dept Mol Biol, NL-6500 HB Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Adams, David J.] Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Cambridge CB10 1SA, England; [Schatz, David G.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Krangel, MS (reprint author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, MRC, Clin Sci Ctr, Lymphocyte Dev Grp, Du Cane Rd, London W12 0NN, England.",krang001@mc.duke.edu; kim.nasmyth@bioch.ox.ac.uk; matthias.merkenschlager@csc.mrc.ac.uk,"hao, Bingtao/G-6648-2011; Marks, Hendrik/E-2801-2012; Schatz, David/A-6748-2013","Marks, Hendrik/0000-0002-4198-3731; Schatz, David/0000-0002-5669-1176; Nasmyth, Kim/0000-0001-7030-4403; Terry, Anna/0000-0002-1946-8223; Merkenschlager, Matthias/0000-0003-2889-3288","Medical Research Council, UK; European Union; Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds; Wellcome Trust; National Institutes of Health","We thank S.

In spite of the importance of pyruvate uptake into plastids (organelles within cells of plants and algae), the molecular mechanisms of this uptake have not yet been explored. This is mainly because pyruvate is a relatively small compound that is able to passively permeate lipid bilayers(4), which precludes accurate measurement of pyruvate transport activity in reconstituted liposomes. Using differential transcriptome analyses of C(3) and C(4) plants of the genera Flaveria and Cleome, here we have identified a novel gene that is abundant in C(4) species, named BASS2 (BILE ACID:SODIUM SYMPORTER FAMILY PROTEIN 2). The BASS2 protein is localized at the chloroplast envelope membrane, and is highly abundant in C(4) plants that have the sodium-dependent pyruvate transporter. Recombinant BASS2 shows sodium-dependent pyruvate uptake activity. Sodium influx is balanced by a sodium: proton antiporter (NHD1), which was mimicked in recombinant Escherichia coli cells expressing both BASS2 and NHD1. Arabidopsis thaliana bass2 mutants lack pyruvate uptake into chloroplasts, which affects plastid-localized isopentenyl diphosphate synthesis, as evidenced by increased sensitivity of such mutants to mevastatin, an inhibitor of cytosolic isopentenyl diphosphate biosynthesis. We thus provide molecular evidence for a sodium-coupled metabolite transporter in plastid envelopes. Orthologues of BASS2 can be detected in all the genomes of land plants that have been characterized so far, thus indicating the widespread importance of sodium-coupled pyruvate import into plastids.","[Furumoto, Tsuyoshi; Shimamura, Masaki] Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Higashihiroshima 7398526, Japan; [Furumoto, Tsuyoshi; Yamaguchi, Teppei; Ohshima-Ichie, Yumiko; Nakamura, Masayoshi; Tsuchida-Iwata, Yoshiko; Hata, Shingo; Izui, Katsura] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Biostudies, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Ohnishi, Junichi] Saitama Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Engn, Sakura Ku, Saitama 3388570, Japan; [Hata, Shingo] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Bioagr Sci, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Gowik, Udo; Westhoff, Peter] Univ Dusseldorf, Inst Entwicklungs & Mol Biol Pflanzen, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany; [Braeutigam, Andrea; Weber, Andreas P.

This phenomenon, known as the coffee-ring effect(1-3), is familiar to anyone who has observed a drop of coffee dry. During the drying process, drop edges become pinned to the substrate, and capillary flow outward from the centre of the drop brings suspended particles to the edge as evaporation proceeds. After evaporation, suspended particles are left highly concentrated along the original drop edge. The coffee-ring effect is manifested in systems with diverse constituents, ranging from large colloids(1,4,5) to nanoparticles(6) and individual molecules(7). In fact-despite the many practical applications for uniform coatings in printing(8), biology(9,10) and complex assembly(11)-the ubiquitous nature of the effect has made it difficult to avoid(6,12-16). Here we show experimentally that the shape of the suspended particles is important and can be used to eliminate the coffee-ring effect: ellipsoidal particles are deposited uniformly during evaporation. The anisotropic shape of the particles significantly deforms interfaces, producing strong interparticle apillary interactions(17-23). Thus, after the ellipsoids are carried to the air-water interface by the same outward flow that causes the coffee-ring effect for spheres, strong long-ranged interparticle attractions between ellipsoids lead to the formation of loosely packed or arrested structures on the air-water interface(17,18,21,24). These structures prevent the suspended particles from reaching the drop edge and ensure uniform deposition. Interestingly, under appropriate conditions, suspensions of spheres mixed with a small number of ellipsoids also produce uniform deposition. Thus, particle shape provides a convenient parameter to control the deposition of particles, without modification of particle or solvent chemistry.","Univ Penn, Dept Phys & Astron, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; CNRS Rhodia Univ Pennsylvania, Complex Assemblies Soft Matter, UMI 3254, Bristol, PA 19007 USA","Yunker, PJ (reprint author), Univ Penn, Dept Phys & Astron, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",pyunker@sas.upenn.edu,,"Yunker, Peter/0000-0001-8471-4171",,,,29,509,519,50,597,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,18-Aug,2011,476,7360,,,,,308,311,,,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,811JV,WOS:000294206500047,21850105.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,a.g.,yodh,male,1,1,na,na

We find that conditional deletion of both genes in the mouse gut impairs Wnt target gene expression and results in the rapid demise of intestinal crypts, thus phenocopying Wnt pathway inhibition. Mass spectrometry demonstrates that Lgr4 and Lgr5 associate with the Frizzled/Lrp Wnt receptor complex. Each of the four R-spondins, secreted Wnt pathway agonists, can bind to Lgr4, -5 and -6. In HEK293 cells, RSPO1 enhances canonical WNT signals initiated by WNT3A. Removal of LGR4 does not affect WNT3A signalling, but abrogates the RSPO1-mediated signal enhancement, a phenomenon rescued by re-expression of LGR4, -5 or -6. Genetic deletion of Lgr4/5 in mouse intestinal crypt cultures phenocopies withdrawal of Rspo1 and can be rescued by Wnt pathway activation. Lgr5 homologues are facultative Wnt receptor components that mediate Wnt signal enhancement by soluble R-spondin proteins. These results will guide future studies towards the application of R-spondins for regenerative purposes of tissues expressing Lgr5 homologues.","[de Lau, Wim; Barker, Nick; Koo, Bon-Kyoung; Li, Vivian S.

Genes with roles in histone modification were frequent targets of somatic mutation. For example, 32% of DLBCL and 89% of FL cases had somatic mutations in MLL2, which encodes a histone methyltransferase, and 11.4% and 13.4% of DLBCL and FL cases, respectively, had mutations in MEF2B, a calcium-regulated gene that cooperates with CREBBP and EP300 in acetylating histones.

Their energy output and morphology are similar to those of powerful radio galaxies(7), but the source of the luminosity is unclear. Some blobs are associated with ultraviolet or infrared bright galaxies, suggesting an extreme starburst event or accretion onto a central black hole(8-10). Another possibility is gas that is shock-excited by supernovae(11,12). But not all blobs are associated with galaxies(13,14), and these ones may instead be heated by gas falling into a dark-matter halo(15-19). The polarization of the Lya emission can in principle distinguish between these options(20-22), but a previous attempt to detect this signature returned a null detection(23). Here we report observations of polarized Ly alpha from the blob LAB1 (ref. 2). Although the central region shows no measurable polarization, the polarized fraction (P) increases to similar to 20 per cent at a radius of 45 kiloparsecs, forming an almost complete polarized ring. The detection of polarized radiation is inconsistent with the in situ production of Ly alpha photons, and we conclude that they must have been produced in the galaxies hosted within the nebula, and re-scattered by neutral hydrogen.","[Hayes, Matthew] Univ Toulouse, UPS OMP IRAP, Toulouse, France; [Hayes, Matthew] CNRS, IRAP, F-31400 Toulouse, France; [Hayes, Matthew] Univ Geneva, Observ Geneva, CH-1290 Versoix, Switzerland; [Scarlata, Claudia] Univ Minnesota, Sch Phys & Astron, Minnesota Inst Astrophys, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Scarlata, Claudia] CALTECH, Spitzer Sci Ctr, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Siana, Brian] CALTECH, Dept Astron, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Hayes, M (reprint author), Univ Toulouse, UPS OMP IRAP, Toulouse, France.",matthew.hayes@ast.obs-mip.fr,"Hayes, Matthew/D-6692-2014","Hayes, Matthew/0000-0001-8587-218X",European Southern Observatory telescopes at the Paranal Observatory [084.A-0954]; Swiss National Science Foundation; Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-09-BLAN-0234-01],"We thank P.

Indeed, dust supply to the Southern Ocean increases during ice ages, and 'iron fertilization' of the subantarctic zone may have contributed up to 40 parts per million by volume (p. p. m. v.) of the decrease (80-100 p. p. m. v.) in atmospheric carbon dioxide observed during late Pleistocene glacial cycles(3-7). So far, however, the magnitude of Southern Ocean dust deposition in earlier times and its role in the development and evolution of Pleistocene glacial cycles have remained unclear. Here we report a high-resolution record of dust and iron supply to the Southern Ocean over the past four million years, derived from the analysis of marine sediments from ODP Site 1090, located in the Atlantic sector of the subantarctic zone. The close correspondence of our dust and iron deposition records with Antarctic ice core reconstructions of dust flux covering the past 800,000 years (refs 8, 9) indicates that both of these archives record large-scale deposition changes that should apply to most of the Southern Ocean, validating previous interpretations of the ice core data. The extension of the record beyond the interval covered by the Antarctic ice cores reveals that, in contrast to the relatively gradual intensification of glacial cycles over the past three million years, Southern Ocean dust and iron flux rose sharply at the Mid-Pleistocene climatic transition around 1.25 million years ago. This finding complements previous observations over late Pleistocene glacial cycles(5,8,9), providing new evidence of a tight connection between high dust input to the Southern Ocean and the emergence of the deep glaciations that characterize the past one million years of Earth history.","[Martinez-Garcia, Alfredo; Jaccard, Samuel L.; Haug, Gerald H.] ETH, Inst Geol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Martinez-Garcia, Alfredo; Haug, Gerald H.] Univ Potsdam, Inst Geosci, DFG Leibniz Ctr Surface Proc & Climate Studies, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany; [Martinez-Garcia, Alfredo; Rosell-Mele, Antoni] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, ICTA, Bellaterra 08193, Catalonia, Spain; [Rosell-Mele, Antoni] ICREA, Barcelona 08010, Catalonia, Spain; [Rosell-Mele, Antoni] Oregon State Univ, Coll Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Geibert, Walter] Univ Edinburgh, Sch GeoSci, Edinburgh EH9 3JW, Midlothian, Scotland; [Geibert, Walter] Scottish Assoc Marine Sci SAMS, Scottish Marine Lab, Oban PA37 1QA, Argyll, Scotland; [Sigman, Daniel M.] Princeton Univ, Dept Geosci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Martinez-Garcia, A (reprint author), ETH, Inst Geol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",alfredo.martinez-garcia@erdw.ethz.ch,"Martinez-Garcia, Alfredo/A-6244-2010; Geibert, Walter/C-3722-2011; Sigman, Daniel/A-2649-2008; Rosell-Mele, Antoni/B-3433-2013; Jaccard, Samuel/G-3447-2014","Martinez-Garcia, Alfredo/0000-0002-7206-5079; Sigman, Daniel/0000-0002-7923-1973; Rosell-Mele, Antoni/0000-0002-5513-2647; Jaccard, Samuel/0000-0002-5793-0896; Geibert, Walter/0000-0001-8646-2334",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (MICINN); European Commission; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG); ICREA,"We thank S.

Recent geochemical evidence suggests that an early-formed reservoir may have survived in the Earth's mantle for about 4.5 billion years (ref. 2), and melts of this reservoir contributed to the flood basalt emplaced on Baffin Island about 60 million years ago(3-5). However, the volume of this ancient mantle domain and whether it has contributed to other flood basalts is not known. Here we show that basalts from the largest volcanic event in geologic history-the Ontong Java plateau(1,6,7)-also exhibit the isotopic and trace element signatures proposed for the early-Earth reservoir2. Together with the Ontong Java plateau, we suggest that six of the largest volcanic events that erupted in the past 250 million years derive from the oldest terrestrial mantle reservoir. The association of these large volcanic events with an ancient primitive mantle source suggests that its unique geochemical characteristics-it is both hotter (it has greater abundances of the radioactive heat-producing elements) and more fertile than depleted mantle reservoirs-may strongly affect the generation of flood basalts.","[Jackson, Matthew G.] Boston Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Carlson, Richard W.] Carnegie Inst Washington, Dept Terr Magnetism, Washington, DC 20015 USA","Jackson, MG (reprint author), Boston Univ, Dept Earth Sci, 675Commonwealth Ave, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",jacksonm@bu.edu,,,Boston University; Ocean Sciences Section of the National Science Foundation,"We thank J.

To understand better the molecular mechanisms underlying coral biology, here we decoded the approximately 420-megabase genome of Acropora digitifera using next-generation sequencing technology. This genome contains approximately 23,700 gene models. Molecular phylogenetics indicate that the coral and the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis diverged approximately 500 million years ago, considerably earlier than the time over which modern corals are represented in the fossil record (similar to 240 million years ago)(5). Despite the long evolutionary history of the endosymbiosis, no evidence was found for horizontal transfer of genes from symbiont to host. However, unlike several other corals, Acropora seems to lack an enzyme essential for cysteine biosynthesis, implying dependency of this coral on its symbionts for this amino acid. Corals inhabit environments where they are frequently exposed to high levels of solar radiation, and analysis of the Acropora genome data indicates that the coral host can independently carry out de novo synthesis of mycosporine-like amino acids, which are potent ultraviolet-protective compounds. In addition, the coral innate immunity repertoire is notably more complex than that of the sea anemone, indicating that some of these genes may have roles in symbiosis or coloniality. A number of genes with putative roles in calcification were identified, and several of these are restricted to corals. The coral genome provides a platform for understanding the molecular basis of symbiosis and responses to environmental changes.","[Shinzato, Chuya; Shoguchi, Eiichi; Kawashima, Takeshi; Hamada, Mayuko; Hisata, Kanako; Tanaka, Makiko; Fujiwara, Mayuki; Koyanagi, Ryo; Ikuta, Tetsuro; Satoh, Nori] Okinawa Inst Sci & Technol Promot Corp, Marine Genom Unit, Okinawa 9040412, Japan; [Fujiyama, Asao] Natl Inst Genet, Mishima, Shizuoka 4118540, Japan; [Fujie, Manabu] Okinawa Inst Sci & Technol Promot Corp, DNA Sequencing Ctr Sect, Okinawa 9040412, Japan; [Miller, David J.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Miller, David J.] James Cook Univ, Sch Pharm & Mol Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia","Satoh, N (reprint author), Okinawa Inst Sci & Technol Promot Corp, Marine Genom Unit, Okinawa 9040412, Japan.",norisky@oist.jp,"Manager, MEEL/C-4732-2015; Shinzato, Chuya/G-2958-2015; Kawashima, Takeshi/M-4510-2015",,"IT Section of OIST; Human Genome Center, University of Tokyo; MEXT; JSPS, Japan","We acknowledge A.

The extinct bony jawless vertebrates, or 'ostracoderms', are regarded as precursors of jawed vertebrates and provide insight into this formative episode in vertebrate evolution(8-14). Here, using synchrotron radiation X-ray tomography(15,16), we describe the cranial anatomy of galeaspids, a 435-370-million-year-old 'ostracoderm' group from China and Vietnam(17). The paired nasal sacs of galeaspids are located anterolaterally in the braincase, and the hypophyseal duct opens anteriorly towards the oral cavity. These three structures (the paired nasal sacs and the hypophyseal duct) were thus already independent of each other, like in gnathostomes and unlike in cyclostomes and osteostracans (another 'ostracoderm' group), and therefore have the condition that current developmental models regard as prerequisites for the development of jaws(1-3). This indicates that the reorganization of vertebrate cranial anatomy was not driven deterministically by the evolutionary origin of jaws but occurred stepwise, ultimately allowing the rostral growth of ectomesenchyme that now characterizes gnathostome head development(1-3).","[Gai, Zhikun; Donoghue, Philip C.

When in receipt of a windfall of resources, human children begin showing tendencies towards equitable distribution with others at five to seven years of age(4-7). Arguably, however, the primordial situation for human sharing of resources is that which follows cooperative activities such as collaborative foraging, when several individuals must share the spoils of their joint efforts(8-10). Here we show that children of around three years of age share with others much more equitably in collaborative activities than they do in either windfall or parallel-work situations. By contrast, one of humans' two nearest primate relatives, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), 'share' (make food available to another individual) just as often whether they have collaborated with them or not. This species difference raises the possibility that humans' tendency to distribute resources equitably may have its evolutionary roots in the sharing of spoils after collaborative efforts.","[Hamann, Katharina; Tomasello, Michael] Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Anthropol, Dept Dev & Comparat Psychol, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Warneken, Felix] Harvard Univ, Dept Psychol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Greenberg, Julia R.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Zool, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Hamann, K (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Anthropol, Dept Dev & Comparat Psychol, Deutsch Pl 6, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.",khamann@eva.mpg.de; warneken@wjh.harvard.edu,,,EC [215805],"We thank all the children and day-care centres involved in this work for their cooperation, and we thank J.

Only recently have genetic and biochemical studies established that florigen is encoded by FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), a gene that is universally conserved in higher plants(2-4). Nonetheless, the exact function of florigen during floral induction remains poorly understood and receptors for florigen have not been identified. Here we show that the rice FT homologue Hd3a(5) interacts with 14-3-3 proteins in the apical cells of shoots, yielding a complex that translocates to the nucleus and binds to the Oryza sativa (Os)FD1 transcription factor, a rice homologue of Arabidopsis thaliana FD. The resultant ternary 'florigen activation complex' (FAC) induces transcription of OsMADS15, a homologue of A. thaliana APETALA1 (AP1), which leads to flowering. We have determined the 2.4 angstrom crystal structure of rice FAC, which provides a mechanistic basis for florigen function in flowering. Our results indicate that 14-3-3 proteins act as intracellular receptors for florigen in shoot apical cells, and offer new approaches to manipulate flowering in various crops and trees.","[Ohki, Izuru; Furuita, Kyoko; Hayashi, Kokoro; Kojima, Chojiro] Nara Inst Sci & Technol, Lab Biophys, Grad Sch Biol Sci, Nara 6300192, Japan; [Taoka, Ken-ichiro; Tsuji, Hiroyuki; Yanase, Tomoko; Yamaguchi, Midori; Nakashima, Chika; Purwestri, Yekti Asih; Tamaki, Shojiro; Ogaki, Yuka; Shimada, Chihiro; Shimamoto, Ko] Nara Inst Sci & Technol, Lab Plant Mol Genet, Grad Sch Biol Sci, Nara 6300192, Japan; [Nakagawa, Atsushi] Osaka Univ, Inst Prot Res, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan","Kojima, C (reprint author), Nara Inst Sci & Technol, Lab Biophys, Grad Sch Biol Sci, 8916-5 Takayama, Nara 6300192, Japan.",kojima@protein.osaka-u.ac.jp; simamoto@bs.naist.jp,"Ohki, Izuru/C-7883-2013","Nakagawa, Atsushi/0000-0002-1700-7861; Ohki, Izuru/0000-0002-0667-5936; Kojima, Chojiro/0000-0003-2723-8249","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT); Global COE Program at NAIST; Bio-oriented Research Advancement Institution (BRAIN)","We thank Y.

Short interfering RNA (siRNA) silencing of MCU in HeLa cells markedly reduced mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake. MCU overexpression doubled the matrix Ca(2+) concentration increase evoked by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-generating agonists, thus significantly buffering the cytosolic elevation. The purified MCU protein showed channel activity in planar lipid bilayers, with electrophysiological properties and inhibitor sensitivity of the uniporter. A mutant MCU, in which two negatively charged residues of the putative pore-forming region were replaced, had no channel activity and reduced agonist-dependent matrix Ca(2+) concentration transients when overexpressed in HeLa cells.

Although the uniporter's biophysical properties have been studied extensively, its molecular composition remains elusive. We recently used comparative proteomics to identify MICU1 (also known as CBARA1), an EF-hand-containing protein that serves as a putative regulator of the uniporter(5). Here, we use whole-genome phylogenetic profiling, genome-wide RNA co-expression analysis and organelle-wide protein coexpression analysis to predict proteins functionally related to MICU1. All three methods converge on a novel predicted transmembrane protein, CCDC109A, that we now call 'mitochondrial calcium uniporter' (MCU). MCU forms oligomers in the mitochondrial inner membrane, physically interacts with MICU1, and resides within a large molecular weight complex. Silencing MCU in cultured cells or in vivo in mouse liver severely abrogates mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake, whereas mitochondrial respiration and membrane potential remain fully intact. MCU has two predicted transmembrane helices, which are separated by a highly conserved linker facing the intermembrane space. Acidic residues in this linker are required for its full activity. However, an S259A point mutation retains function but confers resistance to Ru360, the most potent inhibitor of the uniporter. Our genomic, physiological, biochemical and pharmacological data firmly establish MCU as an essential component of the mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniporter.","[Baughman, Joshua M.; Perocchi, Fabiana; Girgis, Hany S.; Plovanich, Molly; Belcher-Timme, Casey A.; Sancak, Yasemin; Bao, X.

RNA interference (RNAi)-based loss-of-function screening has proven powerful for the identification of new and interesting cancer targets, and recent studies have used this technology in vivo to identify novel tumour suppressor genes(3). Here we developed a method for identifying novel cancer targets via negative-selection RNAi screening using a human breast cancer xenograft model at an orthotopic site in the mouse. Using this method, we screened a set of metabolic genes associated with aggressive breast cancer and stemness to identify those required for in vivo tumorigenesis. Among the genes identified, phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) is in a genomic region of recurrent copy number gain in breast cancer and PHGDH protein levels are elevated in 70% of oestrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancers. PHGDH catalyses the first step in the serine biosynthesis pathway, and breast cancer cells with high PHGDH expression have increased serine synthesis flux. Suppression of PHGDH in cell lines with elevated PHGDH expression, but not in those without, causes a strong decrease in cell proliferation and a reduction in serine synthesis. We find that PHGDH suppression does not affect intracellular serine levels, but causes a drop in the levels of alpha-ketoglutarate, another output of the pathway and a tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediate. In cells with high PHGDH expression, the serine synthesis pathway contributes approximately 50% of the total anaplerotic flux of glutamine into the TCA cycle. These results reveal that certain breast cancers are dependent on increased serine pathway flux caused by PHGDH overexpression and demonstrate the utility of in vivo negative-selection RNAi screens for finding potential anticancer targets.","[Possemato, Richard; Shaul, Yoav D.; Pacold, Michael E.; Kim, Dohoon; Birsoy, Kivanc; Chen, Walter W.; Barrett, Francesca G.; Tsun, Zhi-Yang; Kalaany, Nada Y.; Hsu, Peggy P.; Ottina, Kathleen; Chan, Albert M.; Yuan, Bingbing; Sabatini, David M.] Nine Cambridge Ctr, Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Possemato, Richard; Shaul, Yoav D.; Pacold, Michael E.; Kim, Dohoon; Birsoy, Kivanc; Chen, Walter W.; Tsun, Zhi-Yang; Kalaany, Nada Y.; Hsu, Peggy P.; Ottina, Kathleen; Chan, Albert M.; Sabatini, David M.] MIT, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Possemato, Richard; Shaul, Yoav D.; Pacold, Michael E.; Kim, Dohoon; Birsoy, Kivanc; Chen, Walter W.; Stransky, Nicolas; Cowley, Glenn S.; Barretina, Jordi; Kalaany, Nada Y.; Hsu, Peggy P.; Ottina, Kathleen; Chan, Albert M.; Garraway, Levi A.; Root, David E.; Sabatini, David M.] MIT, Cambridge Ctr 7, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Possemato, Richard; Shaul, Yoav D.; Pacold, Michael E.; Kim, Dohoon; Birsoy, Kivanc; Chen, Walter W.; Barrett, Francesca G.; Stransky, Nicolas; Tsun, Zhi-Yang; Cowley, Glenn S.; Barretina, Jordi; Kalaany, Nada Y.; Hsu, Peggy P.; Ottina, Kathleen; Chan, Albert M.; Garraway, Levi A.; Root, David E.; Sabatini, David M.] Broad Inst Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Shaul, Yoav D.; Pacold, Michael E.; Kim, Dohoon; Birsoy, Kivanc; Chen, Walter W.; Tsun, Zhi-Yang; Kalaany, Nada Y.; Hsu, Peggy P.; Ottina, Kathleen; Chan, Albert M.; Sabatini, David M.] MIT, David H Koch Inst Integrat Canc Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Marks, Kevin M.; Sethumadhavan, Shalini; Woo, Hin-Koon; Jha, Abhishek K.; Driggers, Edward M.] Agios Pharmaceut, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Pacold, Michael E.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Harvard Radiat Oncol Program, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Barretina, Jordi; Garraway, Levi A.] Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Barretina, Jordi; Garraway, Levi A.] Ctr Canc Genome Discovery, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Barretina, Jordi; Garraway, Levi A.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Mino-Kenudson, Mari; Brachtel, Elena F.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Mino-Kenudson, Mari; Brachtel, Elena F.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA","Sabatini, DM (reprint author), Nine Cambridge Ctr, Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",sabatini@wi.mit.edu,,"Chen, Walter/0000-0002-7752-9581; /0000-0002-1446-7256; Possemato, Richard/0000-0002-2401-0030",S.

Unlike peptide bond formation, peptide release is strongly impaired by mutations of nucleotides within the active site, in particular by base exchanges at position A2602 (refs 1, 2). The 2'-OH group of A76 of the peptidyl-tRNA substrate seems to have a key role in peptide release(3). According to computational analysis(4), the 2'-OH may take part in a concerted 'proton shuttle' by which the leaving group is protonated, in analogy to similar current models of peptide bond formation(4-6). Here we report kinetic solvent isotope effects and proton inventories (reaction rates measured in buffers with increasing content of deuterated water, D(2)O) of the two reactions catalysed by the active site of the Escherichia coli ribosome. The transition state of the release factor 2 (RF2)-dependent hydrolysis reaction is characterized by the rate-limiting formation of a single strong hydrogen bond. This finding argues against a concerted proton shuttle in the transition state of the hydrolysis reaction. In comparison, the proton inventory for peptide bond formation indicates the rate-limiting formation of three hydrogen bonds with about equal contributions, consistent with a concerted eight-membered proton shuttle in the transition state(5). Thus, the ribosome supports different rate-limiting transition states for the two reactions that take place in the peptidyl transferase centre.","[Kuhlenkoetter, Stephan; Wintermeyer, Wolfgang; Rodnina, Marina V.] Max Planck Inst Biophys Chem, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany","Rodnina, MV (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Biophys Chem, Am Fassberg 11, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",rodnina@mpibpc.mpg.de,,"Rodnina, Marina/0000-0003-0105-3879",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft,We thank H.-H.

The condensation reactions mediating this carbon-carbon bond formation can be catalysed by enzymes from the thiolase superfamily, including beta-ketoacyl-acyl-carrier protein (ACP) synthases, polyketide synthases, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthases, and biosynthetic thiolases(1). Pathways involving these enzymes have been exploited for fuel and chemical production, with fatty-acid biosynthesis (beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthases) attracting the most attention in recent years(2-4). Degradative thiolases, which are part of the thiolase superfamily and naturally function in the beta-oxidation of fatty acids(5,6), can also operate in the synthetic direction and thus enable carbon-chain elongation. Here we demonstrate that a functional reversal of the beta-oxidation cycle can be used as a metabolic platform for the synthesis of alcohols and carboxylic acids with various chain lengths and functionalities. This pathway operates with coenzyme A (CoA) thioester intermediates and directly uses acetylCoA for acyl-chain elongation (rather than first requiring ATP-dependent activation to malonyl-CoA), characteristics that enable product synthesis at maximum carbon and energy efficiency. The reversal of the beta-oxidation cycle was engineered in Escherichia coli and used in combination with endogenous dehydrogenases and thioesterases to synthesize n-alcohols, fatty acids and 3-hydroxy-, 3-keto- and trans-Delta(2)-carboxylic acids. The superior nature of the engineered pathway was demonstrated by producing higher-chain linear n-alcohols (C >= 4) and extracellular long-chain fatty acids (C > 10) at higher efficiency than previously reported(2,4,7-9). The ubiquitous nature of beta-oxidation, aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase and thioesterase enzymes has the potential to enable the efficient synthesis of these products in other industrial organisms.","[Dellomonaco, Clementina; Clomburg, James M.; Miller, Elliot N.; Gonzalez, Ramon] Rice Univ, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Gonzalez, Ramon] Rice Univ, Dept Bioengn, Houston, TX 77005 USA","Gonzalez, R (reprint author), Rice Univ, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",Ramon.Gonzalez@rice.edu,"Gonzalez, Ramon/B-1961-2010",,,,,40,235,242,8,167,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,18-Aug,2011,476,7360,,,,,355,U131,,10.1038/nature10333,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,811JV,WOS:000294206500043,21832992.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,ramon,gonzalez,na,na,na,na,na

Here we leverage the recent mixture of people of African and European ancestry in the Americas to build a genetic map measuring the probability of crossing over at each position in the genome, based on about 2.1 million crossovers in 30,000 unrelated African Americans. At intervals of more than three megabases it is nearly identical to a map built in Europeans. At finer scales it differs significantly, and we identify about 2,500 recombination hotspots that are active in people of West African ancestry but nearly inactive in Europeans. The probability of a crossover at these hotspots is almost fully controlled by the alleles an individual carries at PRDM9(P value <10(-245)). We identify a 17-base-pair DNA sequence motif that is enriched in these hotspots, and is an excellent match to the predicted binding target of PRDM9 alleles common in West Africans and rare in Europeans. Sites of this motif are predicted to be risk loci for disease-causing genomic rearrangements in individuals carrying these alleles. More generally, this map provides a resource for research in human genetic variation and evolution.","[Tandon, Arti; Patterson, Nick; Rohland, Nadin; Reich, David] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge Ctr 7, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Hinch, Anjali G.; Myers, Simon R.] Univ Oxford, Wellcome Trust Ctr Human Genet, Oxford OX3 7BN, England; [Tandon, Arti; Rohland, Nadin; Reich, David] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Song, Yunli; Myers, Simon R.] Univ Oxford, Dept Stat, Oxford OX1 3TG, England; [Palmer, Cameron D.; Hirschhorn, Joel N.] Broad Inst, Program Med & Populat Genet, Cambridge Ctr 7, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Palmer, Cameron D.; Hirschhorn, Joel N.] Childrens Hosp Boston, Div Endocrinol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Palmer, Cameron D.; Hirschhorn, Joel N.] Childrens Hosp Boston, Div Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Palmer, Cameron D.; Hirschhorn, Joel N.] Childrens Hosp Boston, Program Genom, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Chen, Gary K.; Casey, Graham; Ingles, Sue A.; Press, Michael F.; Henderson, Brian E.; Haiman, Christopher A.] Univ So Calif, Keck Sch Med, Kenneth Norris Jr Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dept Prevent Med, Los Angeles, CA 90033 USA; [Chen, Gary K.; Casey, Graham; Ingles, Sue A.; Press, Michael F.; Henderson, Brian E.; Haiman, Christopher A.] Univ So Calif, Keck Sch Med, Kenneth Norris Jr Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dept Pathol, Los Angeles, CA 90033 USA; [Wang, Kai] Univ So Calif, Zilkha Neurogenet Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Wang, Kai; Glessner, Joseph; Keating, Brendan; Hakonarson, Hakon] Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Ctr Appl Genom, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Buxbaum, Sarah G.; Akylbekova, Ermeg L.] Jackson State Univ, Jackson Heart Study Coordinating Ctr, Jackson, MS 39213 USA; [Akylbekova, Ermeg L.; Musani, Solomon; Taylor, Herman A., Jr.] Univ Mississippi, Med Ctr, Dept Med, Jackson, MS 39216 USA; [Aldrich, Melinda C.] Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Dept Thorac Surg, Nashville, TN 37203 USA; [Aldrich, Melinda C.; Blot, William J.; Cai, Qiuyin; Deming, Sandra L.; Signorello, Lisa B.; Zheng, Wei] Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Vanderbilt Epidemiol Ctr, Div Epidemiol,Dept Med, Nashville, TN 37203 USA; [Aldrich, Melinda C.; Blot, William J.; Cai, Qiuyin; Deming, Sandra L.; Signorello, Lisa B.; Zheng, Wei] Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Vanderbilt Ingram Canc Ctr, Nashville, TN 37203 USA; [Ambrosone, Christine B.] Roswell Pk Canc Inst, Dept Canc Prevent & Control, Buffalo, NY 14263 USA; [Amos, Christopher; Spitz, Margaret; Wu, Xifeng] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Epidemiol, Div Canc Prevent & Populat Sci, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Bandera, Elisa V.] Canc Inst New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USA; [Berndt, Sonja I.; Caporaso, Neil; Tucker, Margaret A.; Ziegler, Regina G.; Chanock, Stephen J.] NCI, Div Canc Epidemiol & Genet, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Bernstein, Leslie] City Hope Natl Med Ctr, Div Canc Etiol, Dept Populat Sci, Beckman Res Inst, Duarte, CA 91010 USA; [Blot, William J.; Signorello, Lisa B.] Int Epidemiol Inst, Rockville, MD 20850 USA; [Bock, Cathryn H.; Schwartz, Ann G.] Wayne State Univ Med, Karmanos Canc Inst, Detroit, MI 48201 USA; [Bock, Cathryn H.; Schwartz, Ann G.] Wayne State Univ Med, Dept Oncol, Detroit, MI 48201 USA; [Boerwinkle, Eric] Univ Texas Houston, Ctr Human Genet, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Boerwinkle, Eric] Univ Texas Houston, Div Epidemiol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Cupples, L.

Hydrothermal vent ecosystems are dominated by animals that live in symbiosis with chemosynthetic bacteria. So far, only two energy sources have been shown to power chemosynthetic symbioses: reduced sulphur compounds and methane. Using metagenome sequencing, single-gene fluorescence in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, shipboard incubations and in situ mass spectrometry, we show here that the symbionts of the hydrothermal vent mussel Bathymodiolus from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge use hydrogen to power primary production. In addition, we show that the symbionts of Bathymodiolus mussels from Pacific vents have hupL, the key gene for hydrogen oxidation. Furthermore, the symbionts of other vent animals such as the tubeworm Riftia pachyptila and the shrimp Rimicaris exoculata also have hupL. We propose that the ability to use hydrogen as an energy source is widespread in hydrothermal vent symbioses, particularly at sites where hydrogen is abundant.","[Petersen, Jillian M.; Zielinski, Frank U.; Moraru, Cristina; Amann, Rudolf; Fink, Dennis; Borowski, Christian; Dubilier, Nicole] Max Planck Inst Marine Microbiol, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Zielinski, Frank U.] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Pape, Thomas] Univ Bremen, MARUM Ctr Marine Environm Sci, D-28334 Bremen, Germany; [Pape, Thomas; Bach, Wolfgang] Univ Bremen, Dept Geosci, D-28334 Bremen, Germany; [Seifert, Richard] Univ Hamburg, Inst Biogeochem & Marine Chem, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Hourdez, Stephane] CNRS UPMC UMR 7144, Biol Stn, Equipe Genet Adaptat Milieux Extremes, F-29682 Roscoff, France; [Girguis, Peter R.; Wankel, Scott D.] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Barbe, Valerie; Pelletier, Eric] Commissariat Energie Atom Genoscope, F-91000 Evry, France; [Barbe, Valerie; Pelletier, Eric] CNRS, UMR8030, F-91000 Evry, France; [Barbe, Valerie; Pelletier, Eric] Univ Evry Val dEssone, F-91000 Evry, France","Dubilier, N (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Marine Microbiol, Celsiusstr 1, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.",ndubilie@mpi-bremen.de,"Amann, Rudolf/C-6534-2014; Petersen, Jillian/K-6066-2015; Bach, Wolfgang/D-3713-2017","Amann, Rudolf/0000-0002-0846-7372; Bach, Wolfgang/0000-0002-3099-7142; Pape, Thomas/0000-0002-6872-2144; Dubilier, Nicole/0000-0002-9394-825X; Petersen, Jillian/0000-0002-9852-3445","German Science Foundation (DFG) [1144, 60]; DFG Cluster of Excellence ""The Ocean in the Earth System"" at MARUM (Center for Marine Environmental Sciences); Max Planck Society","We thank the chief scientists, and the captains and crews of the research vessels and remotely operated vehicles involved in sampling and analyses at sea.

For trapped atomic ions, the quantized motional and internal degrees of freedom can be coherently manipulated with laser light(1,2). Similar control is difficult to achieve with radio-frequency or microwave radiation: the essential coupling between internal degrees of freedom and motion requires significant field changes over the extent of the atoms' motion(2,3), but such changes are negligible at these frequencies for freely propagating fields. An exception is in the near field of microwave currents in structures smaller than the free-space wavelength(4,5), where stronger gradients can be generated. Here we first manipulate coherently (on time-scales of 20 nanoseconds) the internal quantum states of ions held in a microfabricated trap. The controlling magnetic fields are generated by microwave currents in electrodes that are integrated into the trap structure. We also generate entanglement between the internal degrees of freedom of two atoms with a gate operation(4,6-8) suitable for general quantum computation(9); the entangled state has a fidelity of 0.76(3), where the uncertainty denotes standard error of the mean.

Nevertheless, scaling up such methods to achieve large-scale, universal quantum information processing (or more specialized quantum simulations(2-5)) remains challenging. The use of easily controllable and stable microwave sources, rather than complex laser systems(6,7), could remove obstacles to scalability. However, the microwave approach has drawbacks: it involves the use of magnetic-field sensitive states, which shorten coherence times considerably, and requires large, stable magnetic field gradients. Here we show how to overcome both problems by using stationary atomic quantum states as qubits that are induced by microwave fields (that is, by dressing magnetic-field-sensitive states with microwave fields). This permits fast quantum logic, even in the presence of a small (effective) Lamb-Dicke parameter (and, therefore, moderate magnetic field gradients). We experimentally demonstrate the basic building blocks of this scheme, showing that the dressed states are long lived and that coherence times are increased by more than two orders of magnitude relative to those of bare magnetic-field-sensitive states. This improves the prospects of microwave-driven ion trap quantum information processing, and offers a route to extending coherence times in all systems that suffer from magnetic noise, such as neutral atoms, nitrogen-vacancy centres, quantum dots or circuit quantum electrodynamic systems.","[Timoney, N.; Baumgart, I.; Johanning, M.; Varon, A.

Although the giant magnetoresistance effect has improved the electrical read out of memory elements, magnetic writing remains the object of major research efforts(1). Despite several reports of methods to reverse the polarity of nanosized magnets by means of local electric fields(2,3) and currents(4-6), the simple reversal of a high-coercivity, single-layer ferromagnet remains a challenge. Materials with large coercivity and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy represent the mainstay of data storage media, owing to their ability to retain a stable magnetization state over long periods of time and their amenability to miniaturization(7). However, the same anisotropy properties that make a material attractive for storage also make it hard to write to(8). Here we demonstrate switching of a perpendicularly magnetized cobalt dot driven by in-plane current injection at room temperature. Our device is composed of a thin cobalt layer with strong perpendicular anisotropy and Rashba interaction induced by asymmetric platinum and AlO(x) interface layers(9,10). The effective switching field is orthogonal to the direction of the magnetization and to the Rashba field. The symmetry of the switching field is consistent with the spin accumulation induced by the Rashba interaction and the spin-dependent mobility observed in non-magnetic semiconductors(11,12), as well as with the torque induced by the spin Hall effect in the platinum layer(13,14). Our measurements indicate that the switching efficiency increases with the magnetic anisotropy of the cobalt layer and the oxidation of the aluminium layer, which is uppermost, suggesting that the Rashba interaction has a key role in the reversal mechanism. To prove the potential of in-plane current switching for spintronic applications, we construct a reprogrammable magnetic switch that can be integrated into non-volatile memory and logic architectures. This device is simple, scalable and compatible with present-day magnetic recording technology.","[Mihai Miron, Ioan; Garello, Kevin; Costache, Marius V.; Gambardella, Pietro] Catalan Inst Nanotechnol ICN CIN2, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Gaudin, Gilles; Zermatten, Pierre-Jean; Auffret, Stephane; Bandiera, Sebastien; Rodmacq, Bernard; Schuhl, Alain] INAC, CEA CNRS UJF GINP, UMR 8191, SPINTEC, F-38054 Grenoble, France; [Gambardella, Pietro] ICREA, E-08010 Barcelona, Spain; [Gambardella, Pietro] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Fis, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain","Miron, IM (reprint author), Catalan Inst Nanotechnol ICN CIN2, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain.",mihai.miron.icn@uab.es; pietro.gambardella.icn@uab.es,"Costache, Marius/A-7120-2011",,"European Research Council [StG 203239 NOMAD]; Ministerio de Ciencia y Innovacion [ERA-Net EUI2008-03884, MAT2010-15659]; Agencia de Gestio d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca [2009 SGR 695]; ICREA","We thank S.

The reasons for the slowdown are incompletely understood, with past work identifying changes in fossil fuel, wetland and agricultural sources and hydroxyl (OH) sinks as important causal factors(1,4-8). Here we show that the late-twentieth century changes in the CH(4) growth rates are best explained by reduced microbial sources in the Northern Hemisphere. Our results, based on synchronous time series of atmospheric CH(4) mixing and (13)C/(12)C ratios and a two-box atmospheric model, indicate that the evolution of the mixing ratio requires no significant change in Southern Hemisphere sources between 1984 and 2005. Observed changes in the interhemispheric difference of (13)C effectively exclude reduced fossil fuel emissions as the primary cause of the slowdown. The (13)C observations are consistent with long-term reductions in agricultural emissions or another microbial source within the Northern Hemisphere. Approximately half (51 +/- 18%) of the decrease in Northern Hemisphere CH(4) emissions can be explained by reduced emissions from rice agriculture in Asia over the past three decades associated with increases in fertilizer application(9) and reductions in water use(10,11).","[Kai, Fuu Ming; Tyler, Stanley C.; Randerson, James T.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Blake, Donald R.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Chem, Irvine, CA 92697 USA","Kai, FM (reprint author), Singapore MIT Alliance Res & Technol, S16-05-08,3 Sci Dr 2, Singapore 117543, Singapore.",fmkai@smart.mit.edu,"Kai, Fuu Ming/C-3890-2013","Blake, Donald/0000-0002-8283-5014","NASA [NGT5-30409, NNX08AF64G]; NSF [ATM 9871077, ATM-0628637, AGS-1021776]","We thank the many researchers associated with the laboratories referred to as NOAA, NIWA, UW and UCI who took part in collecting and measuring many thousands of air samples over the years.

Both gases are emitted from fossil fuels and biomass burning, whereas methane (CH(4)) alone has large sources from wetlands, agriculture, landfills and waste water. Here we use measurements in firn (perennial snowpack) air from Greenland and Antarctica to reconstruct the atmospheric variability of ethane (C(2)H(6)) during the twentieth century. Ethane levels rose from early in the century until the 1980s, when the trend reversed, with a period of decline over the next 20 years. We find that this variability was primarily driven by changes in ethane emissions from fossil fuels; these emissions peaked in the 1960s and 1970s at 14-16 teragrams per year (1 Tg = 10(12) g) and dropped to 8-10 Tg yr(-1) by the turn of the century. The reduction in fossil-fuel sources is probably related to changes in light hydrocarbon emissions associated with petroleum production and use. The ethane-based fossil-fuel emission history is strikingly different from bottom-up estimates of methane emissions from fossil-fuel use(1,2), and implies that the fossil-fuel source of methane started to decline in the 1980s and probably caused the late twentieth century slow-down in the growth rate of atmospheric methane(3,4).","[Aydin, Murat; Verhulst, Kristal R.; Saltzman, Eric S.; Blake, Donald R.; Tang, Qi; Prather, Michael J.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Battle, Mark O.] Bowdoin Coll, Dept Phys & Astron, Brunswick, ME 04011 USA; [Montzka, Stephen A.] Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, Earth Syst Res Labs, Global Monitoring Div, Boulder, CO 80305 USA","Aydin, M (reprint author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",maydin@uci.edu,"Tang, Qi/C-1032-2011","Montzka, Stephen/0000-0002-9396-0400; Blake, Donald/0000-0002-8283-5014","National Science Foundation [ANT-0739598, ANT-0440602, ANT-0440509, ARC-0520460]; NASA [NAG58935]","We thank T.

Rising CO2 may counter that trend by improving plant water-use efficiency(4,5). However, it is not clear how important this CO2-enhanced water use efficiency might be in offsetting warming-induced desiccation because higher CO2 also leads to higher plant biomass, and therefore greater transpirational surface(2,6,7). Furthermore, although warming is predicted to favour warm-season, C-4 grasses, rising CO2 should favour C-3, or cool-season plants(8). Here we show in a semi-arid grassland that elevated CO2 can completely reverse the desiccating effects of moderate warming. Although enrichment of air to 600 p. p. m. v. CO2 increased soil water content (SWC), 1.5/3.0 degrees C day/night warming resulted in desiccation, such that combined CO2 enrichment and warming had no effect on SWC relative to control plots. As predicted, elevated CO2 favoured C-3 grasses and enhanced stand productivity, whereas warming favoured C-4 grasses. Combined warming and CO2 enrichment stimulated above-ground growth of C-4 grasses in 2 of 3 years when soil moisture most limited plant productivity. The results indicate that in a warmer, CO2-enriched world, both SWC and productivity in semi-arid grasslands may be higher than previously expected.","[Morgan, Jack A.; LeCain, Daniel R.; Blumenthal, Dana M.; Dijkstra, Feike A.; West, Mark] USDA ARS, Rangeland Resources Res Unit, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; [Morgan, Jack A.; LeCain, Daniel R.; Blumenthal, Dana M.; Dijkstra, Feike A.; West, Mark] USDA ARS, No Plains Area, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; [Pendall, Elise; Carrillo, Yolima; Williams, David G.; Heisler-White, Jana] Univ Wyoming, Dept Bot, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Pendall, Elise; Carrillo, Yolima; Williams, David G.; Heisler-White, Jana] Univ Wyoming, Program Ecol, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Kimball, Bruce A.] ARS, US Arid Land Agr Res Ctr, USDA, Maricopa, AZ 85238 USA; [Dijkstra, Feike A.] Univ Sydney, Fac Agr Food & Nat Resources, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Morgan, JA (reprint author), USDA ARS, Rangeland Resources Res Unit, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA.",jack.morgan@ars.usda.gov,"Blumenthal, Dana/J-3106-2012; Dijkstra, Feike/H-2182-2012; Williams, David/A-6407-2014","Williams, David/0000-0003-3627-5260; Pendall, Elise/0000-0002-1651-8969; Dijkstra, Feike/0000-0002-6191-6018","US Department of Agriculture; US Department of Agriculture-Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service [2008-35107-18655]; US Department of Energy's Office of Science (Biological and Environmental Research) through the Western Regional Center of the National Institute for Climatic Change Research at Northern Arizona University; National Science Foundation [1021559]","We thank D.

This major clade, whose members are collectively known as gnathostomes ('jawed mouths'), made its earliest definitive appearance in the Silurian period, 444-416 million years (Myr) ago, with both the origin of the modern (crown-group) radiation and the presumptive invasion of land occurring by the end of the Devonian period(2) (359 Myr ago). These events coincided with a major faunal shift that remains apparent today: the transition from Silurian ecosystems dominated by jawless fishes (agnathans) to younger assemblages composed almost exclusively of gnathostomes(2,3). This pattern has inspired several qualitative descriptions of the trophic radiation and ecological ascendance of the earliest jawed vertebrates(3-7). Here we present a quantitative analysis of functional variation in early gnathostome mandibular elements, placing constraints on our understanding of evolutionary patterns during this critical interval. We document an initial increase in functional disparity in the Silurian that stabilized by the first stage of the Devonian, before the occurrence of an Emsian (similar to 400 Myr ago) oxygenation event implicated in the trophic radiation of vertebrates(8). Subsequent taxonomic diversification during the Devonian did not result in increased functional variation; instead, new taxa revisited and elaborated on established mandibular designs. Devonian functional space is dominated by lobe-finned fishes and 'placoderms'; high disparity within the latter implies considerable trophic innovation among jaw-bearing stem gnathostomes. By contrast, the major groups of living vertebrates-ray-finned fishes and tetrapods-show surprisingly conservative mandibular morphologies with little indication of functional diversification or innovation. Devonian gnathostomes reached a point where they ceased to accrue further mandibular functional disparity before becoming taxonomic dominants relative to 'ostracoderm'-grade jawless fishes, providing a new perspective on classic adaptive hypotheses concerning this fundamental shift in vertebrate biodiversity.","[Anderson, Philip S.

The PFC guides behaviour and thought using working memory(5), which are essential functions in the information age. Many PFC neurons hold information in working memory through excitatory networks that can maintain persistent neuronal firing in the absence of external stimulation(6). This fragile process is highly dependent on the neurochemical environment(7). For example, elevated cyclic-AMP signalling reduces persistent firing by opening HCN and KCNQ potassium channels(8,9). It is not known if molecular changes associated with normal ageing alter the physiological properties of PFC neurons during working memory, as there have been no in vivo recordings, to our knowledge, from PFC neurons of aged monkeys. Here we characterize the first recordings of this kind, revealing a marked loss of PFC persistent firing with advancing age that can be rescued by restoring an optimal neurochemical environment. Recordings showed an age-related decline in the firing rate of DELAY neurons, whereas the firing of CUE neurons remained unchanged with age. The memory-related firing of aged DELAY neurons was partially restored to more youthful levels by inhibiting cAMP signalling, or by blocking HCN or KCNQ channels. These findings reveal the cellular basis of age-related cognitive decline in dorsolateral PFC, and demonstrate that physiological integrity can be rescued by addressing the molecular needs of PFC circuits.","[Wang, Min; Gamo, Nao J.; Yang, Yang; Jin, Lu E.; Wang, Xiao-Jing; Laubach, Mark; Mazer, James A.; Lee, Daeyeol; Arnsten, Amy F.

Epidemiological studies have shown that genetic factors are primarily responsible for the substantially increased frequency of the disease seen in the relatives of affected individuals(2,3), and systematic attempts to identify linkage in multiplex families have confirmed that variation within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) exerts the greatest individual effect on risk(4). Modestly powered genome-wide association studies (GWAS)(5-10) have enabled more than 20 additional risk loci to be identified and have shown that multiple variants exerting modest individual effects have a key role in disease susceptibility(11). Most of the genetic architecture underlying susceptibility to the disease remains to be defined and is anticipated to require the analysis of sample sizes that are beyond the numbers currently available to individual research groups. In a collaborative GWAS involving 9,772 cases of European descent collected by 23 research groups working in 15 different countries, we have replicated almost all of the previously suggested associations and identified at least a further 29 novel susceptibility loci. Within the MHC we have refined the identity of the HLA-DRB1 risk alleles and confirmed that variation in the HLA-A gene underlies the independent protective effect attributable to the class I region. Immunologically relevant genes are significantly overrepresented among those mapping close to the identified loci and particularly implicate T-helper-cell differentiation in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis.","[Sawcer, Stephen; Ban, Maria; Kemppinen, Anu; Baker, Amie; Skidmore, Sheila; Compston, Alastair] Univ Cambridge, Dept Clin Neurosci, Addenbrookes Hosp, Cambridge CB2 0QQ, England; [Hellenthal, Garrett; Pirinen, Matti; Spencer, Chris C.

We recently observed that forced expression of a combination of three transcription factors, Brn2 (also known as Pou3f2), Ascl1 and Myt1l, can efficiently convert mouse fibroblasts into functional induced neuronal (iN) cells(13). Here we show that the same three factors can generate functional neurons from human pluripotent stem cells as early as 6 days after transgene activation. When combined with the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor NeuroD1, these factors could also convert fetal and postnatal human fibroblasts into iN cells showing typical neuronal morphologies and expressing multiple neuronal markers, even after downregulation of the exogenous transcription factors. Importantly, the vast majority of human iN cells were able to generate action potentials and many matured to receive synaptic contacts when co-cultured with primary mouse cortical neurons. Our data demonstrate that non-neural human somatic cells, as well as pluripotent stem cells, can be converted directly into neurons by lineage-determining transcription factors. These methods may facilitate robust generation of patient-specific human neurons for in vitro disease modelling or future applications in regenerative medicine.","[Yang, Nan; Vierbuchen, Thomas; Ostermeier, Austin; Fuentes, Daniel R.; Yang, Troy Q.; Sebastiano, Vittorio; Marro, Samuele; Wernig, Marius] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Inst Stem Cell Biol & Regenerat Med, Dept Pathol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Pang, Zhiping P.; Suedhof, Thomas C.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol & Cellular Physiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Vierbuchen, Thomas; Ostermeier, Austin; Wernig, Marius] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Program Canc Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Citri, Ami] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Suedhof, Thomas C.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Wernig, M (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Inst Stem Cell Biol & Regenerat Med, Dept Pathol, 265 Campus Dr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",wernig@stanford.edu,"Yang, Nan/H-3174-2012; Marro, Samuele/I-4493-2014","Marro, Samuele/0000-0002-9326-6945; Fuentes, Daniel/0000-0002-0412-6933; Pang, Zhiping/0000-0002-6183-1233","Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine at Stanford; Ellison Medical Foundation; Stinehard-Reed Foundation; Donald E. and Delia B.

In particular, transplantation of embryonic-stem-cell-derived dopaminergic neurons has been shown to be efficient in restoring motor symptoms in conditions of dopamine deficiency(3,4). However, the use of pluripotent-derived cells might lead to the development of tumours if not properly controlled(5). Here we identified a minimal set of three transcription factors-Mash1 (also known as Ascl1), Nurr1 (also known as Nr4a2) and Lmx1a-that are able to generate directly functional dopaminergic neurons from mouse and human fibroblasts without reverting to a progenitor cell stage. Induced dopaminergic (iDA) cells release dopamine and show spontaneous electrical activity organized in regular spikes consistent with the pacemaker activity featured by brain dopaminergic neurons. The three factors were able to elicit dopaminergic neuronal conversion in prenatal and adult fibroblasts from healthy donors and Parkinson's disease patients. Direct generation of iDA cells from somatic cells might have significant implications for understanding critical processes for neuronal development, in vitro disease modelling and cell replacement therapies.","[Caiazzo, Massimiliano; Dell'Anno, Maria Teresa; Colciago, Giorgia; Broccoli, Vania] Ist Sci San Raffaele, Stem Cells & Neurogenesis Unit, Div Neurosci, I-20132 Milan, Italy; [Dvoretskova, Elena; Taverna, Stefano; Leo, Damiana; Sotnikova, Tatyana D.; Russo, Giovanni; Pezzoli, Gianni; Gainetdinov, Raul R.; Dityatev, Alexander] Ist Italiano Tecnol, Dept Neurosci & Brain Technol, I-16163 Genoa, Italy; [Lazarevic, Dejan] CBM Srl, I-34149 Trieste, Italy; [Lazarevic, Dejan; Roncaglia, Paola; Gustincich, Stefano] Int Sch Adv Studies SISSA, Neurobiol Sect, I-34136 Trieste, Italy; [Menegon, Andrea] Ist Sci San Raffaele, Expt Imaging Ctr, Adv Light & Electron Microscopy Bioimaging Ctr, I-20132 Milan, Italy; [Carninci, Piero] RIKEN Yokohama Inst, Omics Sci Ctr, Tsurumi Ku, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Pezzoli, Gianni] Ist Clin Perfezionamento, Parkinson Inst, I-20126 Milan, Italy; [Gustincich, Stefano] Giovanni Armenise Harvard Fdn Lab, I-34136 Trieste, Italy","Broccoli, V (reprint author), Ist Sci San Raffaele, Stem Cells & Neurogenesis Unit, Div Neurosci, I-20132 Milan, Italy.",broccoli.vania@hsr.it,"; Carninci, Piero/K-1568-2014; Caiazzo, Massimiliano/C-1722-2016; Gainetdinov, Raul/G-5875-2011","Dityatev, Alexander/0000-0002-0472-0553; Carninci, Piero/0000-0001-7202-7243; Caiazzo, Massimiliano/0000-0002-8975-3257; Gainetdinov, Raul/0000-0003-2951-6038; lazarevic, dejan/0000-0003-4527-290X; Roncaglia, Paola/0000-0002-2825-0621",Fondazione Grigioni per il Morbo di Parkinson [FGBRCVNI10310-001-V.B.]; Eranet Neuron; Cariplo Foundation; Ministry of Health; Italian Institute of Technology; Fondazione Telethon,"We are thankful to D.

However, the instructive role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in neurogenesis remains unexplored. We recently discovered that miR-9* and miR-124 instruct compositional changes of SWI/SNF-like BAF chromatin-remodelling complexes, a process important for neuronal differentiation and function(3-6). Nearing mitotic exit of neural progenitors, miR-9* and miR-124 repress the BAF53a subunit of the neural-progenitor (np)BAF chromatin-remodelling complex. After mitotic exit, BAF53a is replaced by BAF53b, and BAF45a by BAF45b and BAF45c, which are then incorporated into neuron-specific (n)BAF complexes essential for post-mitotic functions(4). Because miR-9/9* and miR-124 also control multiple genes regulating neuronal differentiation and function(5,7-13), we proposed that these miRNAs might contribute to neuronal fates. Here we show that expression of miR-9/9* and miR-124 (miR-9/9*-124) in human fibroblasts induces their conversion into neurons, a process facilitated by NEUROD2. Further addition of neurogenic transcription factors ASCL1 and MYT1L enhances the rate of conversion and the maturation of the converted neurons, whereas expression of these transcription factors alone without miR-9/9*-124 was ineffective. These studies indicate that the genetic circuitry involving miR-9/9*-124 can have an instructive role in neural fate determination.","[Yoo, Andrew S.; Crabtree, Gerald R.] Stanford Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Yoo, Andrew S.; Crabtree, Gerald R.] Stanford Univ, Dept Dev Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Yoo, Andrew S.; Crabtree, Gerald R.] Stanford Univ, Dept Pathol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Sun, Alfred X.] Stanford Univ, Program Canc Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Li, Li; Li, Yulong; Tsien, Richard W.] Stanford Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Physiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Li, Li] Stanford Univ, Med Scientist Training Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Li, Li] Stanford Univ, Neurosci Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Shcheglovitov, Aleksandr; Portmann, Thomas; Dolmetsch, Ricardo E.] Stanford Univ, Dept Neurobiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lee-Messer, Chris] Stanford Univ, Dept Neurol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Crabtree, GR (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",yooa@wustl.edu; crabtree@stanford.edu,"Li, Li/B-9514-2015","Yoo, Andrew/0000-0002-0304-3247","Agency of Science, Technology and Research of Singapore (A*STAR); Stanford Medical Scientist Training Program; National Institutes of Mental Health (NIMH) [F30MH093125]; Frances B.

Centromeres specify the kinetochore formation sites on individual chromosomes, and are epigenetically marked by the assembly of nucleosomes containing the centromere-specific histone H3 variant, CENP-A(3-12). Although the underlying mechanism is unclear, centromere inheritance is probably dictated by the architecture of the centromeric nucleosome. Here we report the crystal structure of the human centromeric nucleosome containing CENP-A and its cognate alpha-satellite DNA derivative (147 base pairs). In the human CENP-A nucleosome, the DNA is wrapped around the histone octamer, consisting of two each of histones H2A, H2B, H4 and CENP-A, in a left-handed orientation. However, unlike the canonical H3 nucleosome, only the central 121 base pairs of the DNA are visible. The thirteen base pairs from both ends of the DNA are invisible in the crystal structure, and the alpha N helix of CENP-A is shorter than that of H3, which is known to be important for the orientation of the DNA ends in the canonical H3 nucleosome(13). A structural comparison of the CENP-A and H3 nucleosomes revealed that CENP-A contains two extra amino acid residues (Arg 80 and Gly 81) in the loop 1 region, which is completely exposed to the solvent. Mutations of the CENP-A loop 1 residues reduced CENP-A retention at the centromeres in human cells. Therefore, the CENP-A loop 1 may function in stabilizing the centromeric chromatin containing CENP-A, possibly by providing a binding site for trans-acting factors. The structure provides the first atomic-resolution picture of the centromere-specific nucleosome.","[Tachiwana, Hiroaki; Kagawa, Wataru; Shiga, Tatsuya; Osakabe, Akihisa; Miya, Yuta; Saito, Kengo; Kurumizaka, Hitoshi] Waseda Univ, Grad Sch Adv Sci & Engn, Struct Biol Lab, Shinjuku Ku, Tokyo 1628480, Japan; [Hayashi-Takanaka, Yoko; Kimura, Hiroshi] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Frontier Biosci, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Oda, Takashi; Sato, Mamoru] Yokohama City Univ, Grad Sch Nanobiosci, Dept Supramol Biol, Div Macromol Crystallog, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Park, Sam-Yong] Yokohama City Univ, Grad Sch Nanobiosci, Dept Supramol Biol, Prot Design Lab, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan","Kurumizaka, H (reprint author), Waseda Univ, Grad Sch Adv Sci & Engn, Struct Biol Lab, Shinjuku Ku, 2-2 Wakamatsu Cho, Tokyo 1628480, Japan.",kurumizaka@waseda.jp,,"Kimura, Hiroshi/0000-0003-0854-083X; Kurumizaka, Hitoshi/0000-0001-7412-3722","Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan; Waseda Research Institute for Science and Engineering","We thank the beamline scientists, N.

Crystal structures have shown that the active site for peptide bond formation is composed entirely of RNA(1). Recent work has focused on how an RNA active site is able to catalyse this fundamental biological reaction at a suitable rate for protein synthesis. On the basis of the absence of important ribosomal functional groups(2), lack of a dependence on pH(3), and the dominant contribution of entropy to catalysis(4), it has been suggested that the role of the ribosome is limited to bringing the substrates into close proximity. Alternatively, the importance of the 2'-hydroxyl of the peptidyl-transfer RNA(5) and a Bronsted coefficient near zero(6) have been taken as evidence that the ribosome coordinates a proton-transfer network. Here we report the transition state of peptide bond formation, based on analysis of the kinetic isotope effect at five positions within the reaction centre of a peptidyl-transfer RNA mimic. Our results indicate that in contrast to the uncatalysed reaction, formation of the tetrahedral intermediate and proton transfer from the nucleophilic nitrogen both occur in the rate-limiting step. Unlike in previous proposals, the reaction is not fully concerted; instead, breakdown of the tetrahedral intermediate occurs in a separate fast step. This suggests that in addition to substrate positioning, the ribosome is contributing to chemical catalysis by changing the rate-limiting transition state.","[Hiller, David A.; Singh, Vipender; Zhong, Minghong; Strobel, Scott A.] Yale Univ, Dept Mol Biophys & Biochem, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Strobel, SA (reprint author), Yale Univ, Dept Mol Biophys & Biochem, POB 6666, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",scott.strobel@yale.edu,,,NIH [GM54839]; Brown-Coxe fellowship,"We thank J.

A simple physical mimic, using a differentially strained composite of a pliable rubber tube and a soft latex sheet is consistent with this mechanism and produces similar patterns. We devise a mathematical theory and a computational model for the number, size and shape of intestinal loops based solely on the measurable geometry, elasticity and relative growth of the tissues.

Within the mouse thymus, Notch signals are indispensable for imposing the T-cell fate on multipotential haematopoietic progenitors, but the downstream effectors that impart T-lineage specification and commitment are not well understood. Here we show that a transcription factor, T-cell factor 1 (TCF-1; also known as transcription factor 7, T-cell specific, TCF7), is a critical regulator in T-cell specification. TCF-1 is highly expressed in the earliest thymic progenitors, and its expression is upregulated by Notch signals. Most importantly, when TCF-1 is forcibly expressed in bone marrow (BM) progenitors, it drives the development of T-lineage cells in the absence of T-inductive Notch1 signals. Further characterization of these TCF-1-induced cells revealed expression of many T-lineage genes, including T-cell-specific transcription factors Gata3 and Bcl11b, and components of the T-cell receptor.

Associated with this geological dichotomy is a compositional and thermal variation(2,3), with the nearside Procellarum KREEP (potassium/rare-earth element/phosphorus) Terrane and environs interpreted as having thin, compositionally evolved crust in comparison with the massive feldspathic highlands. The lunar dichotomy may have been caused by internal effects (for example spatial variations in tidal heating(4), asymmetric convective processes(5) or asymmetric crystallization of the magma ocean(6)) or external effects (such as the event that formed the South Pole/Aitken basin(1) or asymmetric cratering(7)). Here we consider its origin as a late carapace added by the accretion of a companion moon. Companion moons are a common outcome of simulations(8) of Moon formation from a protolunar disk resulting from a giant impact, and although most coplanar configurations are unstable(9), a similar to 1,200-km-diameter moon located at one of the Trojan points could be dynamically stable for tens of millions of years after the giant impact(10). Most of the Moon's magma ocean would solidify on this timescale(11,12), whereas the companion moon would evolve more quickly into a crust and a solid mantle derived from similar disk material, and would presumably have little or no core. Its likely fate would be to collide with the Moon at similar to 2-3 km s(-1), well below the speed of sound in silicates. According to our simulations, a large moon/Moon size ratio (similar to 0.3) and a subsonic impact velocity lead to an accretionary pile rather than a crater, contributing a hemispheric layer of extent and thickness consistent with the dimensions of the farside highlands(1,13) and in agreement with the degree-two crustal thickness profile(4). The collision furthermore displaces the KREEP-rich layer to the opposite hemisphere, explaining the observed concentration(2,3).","[Jutzi, M.; Asphaug, E.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA; [Jutzi, M.] Univ Bern, Inst Phys, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland","Jutzi, M (reprint author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, 1156 Highst, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA.",martin.jutzi@space.unibe.ch,,,NASA; NSF-MRI,"Our work is sponsored by NASA's Planetary Geology and Geophysics programme 'Small Bodies and Planetary Collisions'.

In electron-doped copper oxides, the absence of an anomalous pseudogap phase in the underdoped region of the phase diagram(2) and weaker electron correlations(3,4) suggest that Mott physics and other unidentified competing orders are less relevant and that antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations are the dominant feature. Here we report a study of magnetotransport in thin films of the electron-doped copper oxide La2-xCexCuO4. We show that a scattering rate that is linearly dependent on temperature-a key feature of the anomalous normal state properties of the copper oxides-is correlated with the electron pairing. We also show that an envelope of such scattering surrounds the superconducting phase, surviving to zero temperature when superconductivity is suppressed by magnetic fields. Comparison with similar behaviour found in organic superconductors(5) strongly suggests that the linear dependence on temperature of the resistivity in the electron-doped copper oxides is caused by spin-fluctuation scattering.","[Jin, K.; Butch, N.

Applications such as quantum information processing depend on understanding it; there are even fundamental theories proposed that go beyond quantum mechanics(1-3), in which the breakdown of quantum theory would appear as an 'intrinsic' decoherence, mimicking the more familiar environmental decoherence processes(4). Such applications cannot be optimized, and such theories cannot be tested, until we have a firm handle on ordinary environmental decoherence processes. Here we show that the theory for insulating electronic spin systems can make accurate and testable predictions for environmental decoherence in molecular-based quantum magnets(5). Experiments on molecular magnets have successfully demonstrated quantum-coherent phenomena(6-8) but the decoherence processes that ultimately limit such behaviour were not well constrained. For molecular magnets, theory predicts three principal contributions to environmental decoherence: from phonons, from nuclear spins and from intermolecular dipolar interactions. We use high magnetic fields on single crystals of Fe(8) molecular magnets (in which the Fe ions are surrounded by organic ligands) to suppress dipolar and nuclear-spin decoherence. In these high-field experiments, we find that the decoherence time varies strongly as a function of temperature and magnetic field. The theoretical predictions are fully verified experimentally, and there are no other visible decoherence sources. In these high fields, we obtain a maximum decoherence quality-factor of 1.49 x 10(6); our investigation suggests that the environmental decoherence time can be extended up to about 500 microseconds, with a decoherence quality factor of similar to 6 x 10(7), by optimizing the temperature, magnetic field and nuclear isotopic concentrations.","[Takahashi, S.] Univ So Calif, Dept Chem, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Takahashi, S.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Terahertz Sci & Technol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Takahashi, S.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Phys, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Tupitsyn, I.

This leads to ocean acidification, one of the major threats to marine ecosystems(2) and particularly to calcifying organisms such as corals(3,4), foraminifera(5-7) and coccolithophores(8). Coccolithophores are abundant phytoplankton that are responsible for a large part of modern oceanic carbonate production. Culture experiments investigating the physiological response of coccolithophore calcification to increased CO(2) have yielded contradictory results between and even within species(8-11). Here we quantified the calcite mass of dominant coccolithophores in the present ocean and over the past forty thousand years, and found a marked pattern of decreasing calcification with increasing partial pressure of CO(2) and concomitant decreasing concentrations of CO(3)(2-). Our analyses revealed that differentially calcified species and morphotypes are distributed in the ocean according to carbonate chemistry. A substantial impact on the marine carbon cycle might be expected upon extrapolation of this correlation to predicted ocean acidification in the future. However, our discovery of a heavily calcified Emiliania huxleyi morphotype in modern waters with low pH highlights the complexity of assemblage-level responses to environmental forcing factors.","[Beaufort, L.; de Garidel-Thoron, T.; Buchet, N.; Grelaud, M.] Univ Aix Marseille, CNRS, CEREGE, F-13545 Aix En Provence 4, France; [Probert, I.; Bendif, E.

Ecological heterogeneity produces evolutionary trade-offs in the physiological design of predators; this is because the ability to capitalize on pulses of food abundance requires high capacity for food-processing, yet maintaining such capacity imposes energetic costs that are taxing during periods of food scarcity(1,2). Recent advances in physiology show that when variation in foraging opportunities is predictable, animals may adjust energetic tradeoffs by rapidly modulating their digestive system to track variation in foraging opportunities(1). However, it is increasingly recognized that foraging opportunities for animals are unpredictable(3), which should favour animals that maintain a capacity for food-processing that exceeds average levels of consumption (loads)(2,4). Despite this basic principle of quantitative evolutionary design, estimates of digestive load: capacity ratios in wild animals are virtually nonexistent(1). Here we provide an extensive assessment of load: capacity ratios for the digestive systems of predators in the wild, compiling 639 estimates across 38 species of fish. We found that piscine predators typically maintain the physiological capacity to feed at daily rates 2-3 times higher than what they experience on average. A numerical simulation of the trade-off between food-processing capacity and metabolic cost suggests that the observed level of physiological opportunism is profitable only if predator-prey encounters, and thus predator energy budgets, are far more variable in nature than currently assumed.","[Armstrong, Jonathan B.; Schindler, Daniel E.] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Armstrong, JB (reprint author), Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Box 355020, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",Jonny99@uw.edu,,,Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation; US National Science Foundation; University of Washington School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences,"We thank T.

Chief among such adaptations is the ability to detect infrared radiation as a means of locating hotspots on warm-blooded prey. Among vertebrates, only vampire bats, boas, pythons and pit vipers are capable of detecting infrared radiation(1,4). In each case, infrared signals are detected by trigeminal nerve fibres that innervate specialized pit organs on the animal's face(5-10). Thus, vampire bats and snakes have taken thermosensation to the extreme by developing specialized systems for detecting infrared radiation. As such, these creatures provide a window into the molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying evolutionary tuning of thermoreceptors in a species-specific or cell-type-specific manner. Previously, we have shown that snakes co-opt a non-heat-sensitive channel, vertebrate TRPA1 (transient receptor potential cation channel A1), to produce an infrared detector(6). Here we show that vampire bats tune a channel that is already heat-sensitive, TRPV1, by lowering its thermal activation threshold to about 30 degrees C. This is achieved through alternative splicing of TRPV1 transcripts to produce a channel with a truncated carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic domain. These splicing events occur exclusively in trigeminal ganglia, and not in dorsal root ganglia, thereby maintaining a role for TRPV1 as a detector of noxious heat in somatic afferents. This reflects a unique organization of the bat Trpv1 gene that we show to be characteristic of Laurasiatheria mammals (cows, dogs and moles), supporting a close phylogenetic relationship with bats. These findings reveal a novel molecular mechanism for physiological tuning of thermosensory nerve fibres.","[Gracheva, Elena O.; Cordero-Morales, Julio F.; Julius, David] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Physiol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Gonzalez-Carcacia, Jose A.; Aranguren, Carla I.] Inst Venezolano Invest Cient, Ctr Ecol, Lab Biol Organismos, Caracas 1020A, Venezuela; [Ingolia, Nicholas T.] Carnegie Inst, Dept Embryol, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Manno, Carlo] Inst Venezolano Invest Cient, Ctr Biofis & Bioquim, Lab Fisiol Celular, Caracas 1020A, Venezuela; [Weissman, Jonathan S.; Julius, David] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Cellular & Mol Pharmacol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Weissman, Jonathan S.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Calif Inst Quantitat Biosci, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Weissman, Jonathan S.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA","Julius, D (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Physiol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA.",ingolia@ciwemb.edu; david.julius@ucsf.edu,,,"Ruth L.

Genetic ablation of ipRGCs eliminates circadian photoentrainment and severely disrupts the pupillary light reflex (PLR)(12,13). Here we show that ipRGCs consist of distinct subpopulations that differentially express the Brn3b transcription factor, and can be functionally distinguished. Brn3b-negative M1 ipRGCs innervate the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, whereas Brn3b-positive ipRGCs innervate all other known brain targets, including the olivary pre-tectal nucleus. Consistent with these innervation patterns, selective ablation of Brn3b-positive ipRGCs severely disrupts the PLR, but does not impair circadian photoentrainment. Thus, we find that molecularly distinct subpopulations of M1 ipRGCs, which are morphologically and electrophysiologically similar, innervate different brain regions to execute specific light-induced functions.","[Chen, S. -K.; Hattar, S.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Biol, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Badea, T.

Epidemiological and functional studies have recently suggested that NK cells can also contribute to the control of HIV-1 infection through recognition of virally infected cells by both activating and inhibitory killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs)(4-7). However, it remains unknown whether NK cells can directly mediate antiviral immune pressure in vivo in humans. Here we describe KIR-associated amino-acid polymorphisms in the HIV-1 sequence of chronically infected individuals, on a population level. We show that these KIR-associated HIV-1 sequence polymorphisms can enhance the binding of inhibitory KIRs to HIV-1-infected CD4(+) T cells, and reduce the antiviral activity of KIR-positive NK cells. These data demonstrate that KIR-positive NK cells can place immunological pressure on HIV-1, and that the virus can evade such NK-cell-mediated immune pressure by selecting for sequence polymorphisms, as was previously described for virus-specific T cells and neutralizing antibodies(8). NK cells might therefore have a previously underappreciated role in contributing to viral evolution.","[Alter, Galit; Schneidewind, Arne; Fadda, Lena; Oniangue-Ndza, Cesar; Li, Bin; Carrington, Mary; Allen, Todd M.; Altfeld, Marcus] Harvard Univ, Ragon Inst MGH MIT & Harvard, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02129 USA; [Heckerman, David; Kadie, Carl M.; Carlson, Jonathan M.] Microsoft Res, Redmond, WA 98053 USA; [Martin, Maureen; Carrington, Mary] NCI, Canc & Inflammat Program, Expt Immunol Lab, SAIC Frederick Inc, Frederick, MD 21702 USA; [Khakoo, Salim I.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Div Med, London W2 1PG, England","Altfeld, M (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Ragon Inst MGH MIT & Harvard, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02129 USA.",maltfeld@partners.org,"Allen, Todd/F-5473-2011","Khakoo, Salim/0000-0002-4057-9091","National Institutes of Health (NIH)/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [R01 AI067031, PO1 AI074415]; Doris Duke Charitable Foundation; National Cancer Institute (NIH) [HHSN261200800001E]; NIH, National Cancer Institute, Center for Cancer Research; Wellcome Trust; Microsoft Research; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; Mark and Lisa Schwartz Foundation; Phillip T. and Susan M.

This pivotal decision in a single gonadal cell type ultimately controls sexual differentiation throughout the body. Sex determination can be viewed as a battle for primacy in the fetal gonad between a male regulatory gene network in which Sry activates Sox9 and a female network involving WNT/beta-catenin signalling(2). In females the primary sex-determining decision is not final: loss of the FOXL2 transcription factor in adult granulosa cells can reprogram granulosa cells into Sertoli cells(2). Here we show that sexual fate is also surprisingly labile in the testis: loss of the DMRT1 transcription factor(3) in mouse Sertoli cells, even in adults, activates Foxl2 and reprograms Sertoli cells into granulosa cells. In this environment, theca cells form, oestrogen is produced and germ cells appear feminized. Thus Dmrt1 is essential to maintain mammalian testis determination, and competing regulatory networks maintain gonadal sex long after the fetal choice between male and female. Dmrt1 and Foxl2 are conserved throughout vertebrates(4,5) and Dmrt1-related sexual regulators are conserved throughout metazoans(3). Antagonism between Dmrt1 and Foxl2 for control of gonadal sex may therefore extend beyond mammals. Reprogramming due to loss of Dmrt1 also may help explain the aetiology of human syndromes linked to DMRT1, including disorders of sexual differentiation(6) and testicular cancer(7).","[Matson, Clinton K.; Murphy, Mark W.; Bardwell, Vivian J.; Zarkower, David] Univ Minnesota, Ctr Dev Biol, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Matson, Clinton K.; Murphy, Mark W.; Bardwell, Vivian J.; Zarkower, David] Univ Minnesota, Dept Genet Cell Biol & Dev, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Matson, Clinton K.; Bardwell, Vivian J.; Zarkower, David] Univ Minnesota, Mol Cellular Dev Biol & Genet Grad Program, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Sarver, Aaron L.; Bardwell, Vivian J.; Zarkower, David] Univ Minnesota, Masonic Canc Ctr, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Griswold, Michael D.] Washington State Univ, Sch Mol Biosci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA","Zarkower, D (reprint author), Univ Minnesota, Ctr Dev Biol, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",bardw001@umn.edu; zarko001@umn.edu,,,NIH [GM59152]; Minnesota Medical Foundation; NSF,"We thank M.

Much is known about PRC2-induced silencing but key questions remain concerning its nucleation and stability. Vernalization, the perception and memory of winter in plants, is a classic epigenetic process that, in Arabidopsis, involves PRC2-based silencing of the floral repressor FLC(5,6). The slow dynamics of vernalization, taking place over weeks in the cold, generate a level of stable silencing of FLC in the subsequent warm that depends quantitatively on the length of the prior cold. These features make vernalization an ideal experimental system to investigate both the maintenance of epigenetic states and the switching between them. Here, using mathematical modelling, chromatin immunoprecipitation and an FLC:GUS reporter assay, we show that the quantitative nature of vernalization is generated by H3K27me3-mediated FLC silencing in the warm in a subpopulation of cells whose number depends on the length of the prior cold. During the cold, H3K27me3 levels progressively increase at a tightly localized nucleation region within FLC. At the end of the cold, numerical simulations predict that such a nucleation region is capable of switching the bistable epigenetic state of an individual locus, with the probability of overall FLC coverage by silencing H3K27me3 marks depending on the length of cold exposure. Thus, the model predicts a bistable pattern of FLC gene expression in individual cells, a prediction we verify using the FLC: GUS reporter system. Our proposed switching mechanism, involving the local nucleation of an opposing histone modification, is likely to be widely relevant in epigenetic reprogramming.","[Song, Jie; Dean, Caroline] John Innes Ctr, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Norwich NR4 7UH, Norfolk, England; [Angel, Andrew; Howard, Martin] John Innes Ctr, Dept Computat & Syst Biol, Norwich NR4 7UH, Norfolk, England","Dean, C (reprint author), John Innes Ctr, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7UH, Norfolk, England.",caroline.dean@jic.ac.uk; martin.howard@jic.ac.uk,"Howard, Martin/C-3629-2016","Howard, Martin/0000-0001-7670-0781; Dean, Caroline/0000-0002-6555-3525",European Research Council; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council; Royal Society,"We thank all members of the C.

When the mitochondrial respiratory complex pumps protons from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space, it builds up an electrochemical potential(2). A fraction of this electrochemical potential is dissipated as heat, in a process involving leakage of protons back to the matrix(2). This leakage, or 'uncoupling' of the proton electrochemical potential, is mediated primarily by uncoupling proteins(2). However, the mechanism of UCP-mediated proton translocation across the lipid bilayer is unknown. Here we describe a solution-NMR method for structural characterization of UCP2. The method, which overcomes some of the challenges associated with membrane-protein structure determination(3), combines orientation restraints derived from NMR residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) and semiquantitative distance restraints from paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) measurements. The local and secondary structures of the protein were determined by piecing together molecular fragments from the Protein Data Bank that best fit experimental RDCs from samples weakly aligned in a DNA nanotube liquid crystal. The RDCs also determine the relative orientation of the secondary structural segments, and the PRE restraints provide their spatial arrangement in the tertiary fold. UCP2 closely resembles the bovine ADP/ATP carrier (the only carrier protein of known structure(4)), but the relative orientations of the helical segments are different, resulting in a wider opening on the matrix side of the inner membrane. Moreover, the nitroxide-labelled GDP binds inside the channel and seems to be closer to transmembrane helices 1-4. We believe that this biophysical approach can be applied to other membrane proteins and, in particular, to other mitochondrial carriers, not only for structure determination but also to characterize various conformational states of these proteins linked to substrate transport.","[Berardi, Marcelo J.; Harrison, Stephen C.; Chou, James J.] Harvard Univ, Jack & Eileen Connors Struct Biol Lab, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Berardi, Marcelo J.; Shih, William M.; Harrison, Stephen C.; Chou, James J.] Harvard Univ, Dept Biol Chem & Mol Pharmacol, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Shih, William M.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Shih, William M.] Harvard Univ, Wyss Inst Biol Inspired Engn, Boston, MA 02138 USA; [Harrison, Stephen C.] Harvard Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Chou, JJ (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Jack & Eileen Connors Struct Biol Lab, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",chou@cmcd.hms.harvard.edu,"Chou, James/N-9840-2013",,"NIH [1U54GM094608, 1DP2OD004641]","We thank K.

The ubiquitous outward-propagating Alfvenic motions observed have amplitudes of the order of 20 km s(-1) and periods of the order of 100-500 s throughout the quiescent atmosphere (compatible with recent investigations(7,10)), and are energetic enough to accelerate the fast solar wind and heat the quiet corona.","[McIntosh, Scott W.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, High Altitude Observ, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [De Pontieu, Bart; Hansteen, Viggo; Boerner, Paul] Lockheed Martin Solar & Astrophys Lab, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA; [Carlsson, Mats; Hansteen, Viggo] Univ Oslo, Inst Theoret Astrophys, N-0315 Oslo, Norway; [Goossens, Marcel] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Math, Ctr Plasma Astrophys, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium","McIntosh, SW (reprint author), Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, High Altitude Observ, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.",mscott@ucar.edu,,,NSF,SDO is the first mission of NASA's Living With a Star Program.

This implies that an antimatter particle has exactly the same mass and absolute value of charge as its particle counterpart. Metastable antiprotonic helium ((p) over bar He+) is a three-body atom(2) consisting of a normal helium nucleus, an electron in its ground state and an antiproton ((p) over bar) occupying a Rydberg state with high principal and angular momentum quantum numbers, respectively n and l, such that n approximate to l + 1 approximate to 38. These atoms are amenable to precision laser spectroscopy, the results of which can in principle be used to determine the antiproton-to-electron mass ratio and to constrain the equality between the antiproton and proton charges and masses. Here we report two-photon spectroscopy of antiprotonic helium, in which (p) over bar He-3(+) and (p) over bar He-4(+) isotopes are irradiated by two-counter-propagating laser beams. This excites nonlinear, two-photon transitions of the antiproton of the type (n, l) -> (n - 2, l - 2) at deep-ultraviolet wavelengths (lambda = 139.8, 193.0 and 197.0 nm), which partly cancel the Doppler broadening of the laser resonance caused by the thermal motion of the atoms. The resulting narrow spectral lines allowed us to measure three transition frequencies with fractional precisions of 2.3-5 parts in 10(9). By comparing the results with three-body quantum electrodynamics calculations, we derived an antiproton-to-electron mass ratio of 1,836.1526736(23), where the parenthetical error represents one standard deviation. This agrees with the proton-to-electron value known to a similar precision.","[Hori, Masaki; Soter, Anna] Max Planck Inst Quantum Opt, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Hori, Masaki; Barna, Daniel; Dax, Andreas; Hayano, Ryugo] Univ Tokyo, Dept Phys, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Barna, Daniel; Horvath, Dezso] KFKI Res Inst Particle & Nucl Phys, H-1525 Budapest, Hungary; [Friedreich, Susanne; Juhasz, Bertalan; Pask, Thomas; Widmann, Eberhard] Stefan Meyer Inst Subatomare Phys, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Horvath, Dezso] Inst Nucl Res, H-4001 Debrecen, Hungary; [Venturelli, Luca; Zurlo, Nicola] Univ Brescia, Dipartimento Chim & Fis Ingn & Mat, I-25133 Brescia, Italy; [Venturelli, Luca; Zurlo, Nicola] Grp Col Brescia, Ist Nazl Fis Nucl, I-25133 Brescia, Italy","Hori, M (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Quantum Opt, Hans Kopfermann Str 1, D-85748 Garching, Germany.",masaki.hori@mpq.mpg.de,"Widmann, Eberhard/G-2545-2011; Hori, Masaki/D-8231-2011; Soter, Anna/B-6794-2014; Hayano, Ryugo/F-7889-2012","Widmann, Eberhard/0000-0003-0486-6023; Hori, Masaki/0000-0002-4999-3141; Hayano, Ryugo/0000-0002-1214-7806",European Science Foundation (EURYI); Monbukagakusho [20002003]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Hungarian Research Foundation [K72172]; Austrian Federal Ministry of Science and Research,"This work was supported by the European Science Foundation (EURYI), Monbukagakusho (grant no. 20002003), the Munich Advanced Photonics cluster of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, the Hungarian Research Foundation (K72172) and the Austrian Federal Ministry of Science and Research.

Fire has been largely absent from most of this biome since the early Holocene epoch(3), but its frequency and extent are increasing, probably in response to climate warming(4). The effect of fires on the C balance of tundra landscapes, however, remains largely unknown. The Anaktuvuk River fire in 2007 burned 1,039 square kilometres of Alaska's Arctic slope, making it the largest fire on record for the tundra biome and doubling the cumulative area burned since 1950 (ref. 5). Here we report that tundra ecosystems lost 2,016 +/- 435 g C m(-2) in the fire, an amount two orders of magnitude larger than annual net C exchange in undisturbed tundra(6). Sixty per cent of this C loss was from soil organic matter, and radiocarbon dating of residual soil layers revealed that the maximum age of soil C lost was 50 years. Scaled to the entire burned area, the fire released approximately 2.1 teragrams of C to the atmosphere, an amount similar in magnitude to the annual net C sink for the entire Arctic tundra biome averaged over the last quarter of the twentieth century(7). The magnitude of ecosystem C lost by fire, relative to both ecosystem and biome-scale fluxes, demonstrates that a climate-driven increase in tundra fire disturbance may represent a positive feedback, potentially offsetting Arctic greening(8) and influencing the net C balance of the tundra biome.","[Mack, Michelle C.; Schuur, Edward A.

Various studies(1-5) have found evidence for a founder event (bottleneck) in East Asian and European populations, associated with the human dispersal out-of-Africa event around 60 thousand years (kyr) ago. However, these studies have had to assume simplified demographic models with few parameters, and they do not provide a precise date for the start and stop times of the bottleneck. Here, with fewer assumptions on population size changes, we present a more detailed history of human population sizes between approximately ten thousand and a million years ago, using the pairwise sequentially Markovian coalescent model applied to the complete diploid genome sequences of a Chinese male (YH)(6), a Korean male (SJK)(7), three European individuals (J. C. Venter(8), NA12891 and NA12878 (ref. 9)) and two Yoruba males (NA18507 (ref. 10) and NA19239). We infer that European and Chinese populations had very similar population-size histories before 10-20 kyr ago. Both populations experienced a severe bottleneck 10-60 kyr ago, whereas African populations experienced a milder bottleneck from which they recovered earlier. All three populations have an elevated effective population size between 60 and 250 kyr ago, possibly due to population substructure(11). We also infer that the differentiation of genetically modern humans may have started as early as 100-120 kyr ago(12), but considerable genetic exchanges may still have occurred until 20-40 kyr ago.","[Li, Heng; Durbin, Richard] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Cambridge CB10 1SA, England; [Li, Heng] Broad Inst Harvard & MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA","Durbin, R (reprint author), Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Cambridge CB10 1SA, England.",lh3@sanger.ac.uk; rd@sanger.ac.uk,"Li, Heng/D-9344-2011","Li, Heng/0000-0003-4874-2874; Durbin, Richard/0000-0002-9130-1006",Wellcome Trust [WT077192],"We are grateful to D.

Although MeCP2 is expressed in most tissues(2), loss of MeCP2 expression results primarily in neurological symptoms(1,3,4). Earlier studies suggested the idea that RTT is due exclusively to loss of MeCP2 function in neurons(2,4-10). Although defective neurons clearly underlie the aberrant behaviours, we and others showed recently that the loss of MECP2 from glia negatively influences neurons in a non-cell-autonomous fashion(11-13). Here we show that in globally MeCP2-deficient mice, re-expression of Mecp2 preferentially in astrocytes significantly improved locomotion and anxiety levels, restored respiratory abnormalities to a normal pattern, and greatly prolonged lifespan compared to globally null mice. Furthermore, restoration of MeCP2 in the mutant astrocytes exerted a non-cell-autonomous positive effect on mutant neurons in vivo, restoring normal dendritic morphology and increasing levels of the excitatory glutamate transporter VGLUT1. Our study shows that glia, like neurons, are integral components of the neuropathology of RTT, and supports the targeting of glia as a strategy for improving the associated symptoms.","[Lioy, Daniel T.; Garg, Saurabh K.; Monaghan, Caitlin E.; Mandel, Gail] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Vollum Inst, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Lioy, Daniel T.; Garg, Saurabh K.; Monaghan, Caitlin E.; Mandel, Gail] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chevy Chase, MD 20815 USA; [Raber, Jacob] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Behav Neurosci, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Raber, Jacob] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Neurol, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Raber, Jacob] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Div Neurosci, Oregon Natl Primate Res Ctr, Beaverton, OR 97006 USA; [Foust, Kevin D.; Kaspar, Brian K.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Pediat, Ctr Gene Therapy, Nationwide Childrens Hosp, Columbus, OH 43205 USA; [Hirrlinger, Petra G.] Paul Flechsig Inst Brain Res, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany; [Kirchhoff, Frank] Max Planck Inst Expt Med, Dept Neurogenet, D-37075 Gottingen, Germany; [Kirchhoff, Frank] Univ Saarland, Inst Pathol, D-37075 Homburg, Germany; [Bissonnette, John M.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Portland, OR 97202 USA; [Bissonnette, John M.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Portland, OR 97202 USA; [Ballas, Nurit] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Biochem & Cell Biol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA","Mandel, G (reprint author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Vollum Inst, Portland, OR 97239 USA.",mandelg@ohsu.edu,"Kaspar, Brian/E-3349-2011; Kirchhoff, Frank/B-9335-2008","Kirchhoff, Frank/0000-0002-2324-2761",National Institutes of Health; International Rett Syndrome Foundation; Rett Syndrome Research Trust; Oregon Brain Institute; OHSU,"We thank P.

Although recent work has identified visually-evoked local dendritic calcium signals in the rodent visual cortex(5), sensory-evoked signalling on the level of dendritic spines, corresponding to individual afferent excitatory synapses, remains unexplored(6). Here we used a new variant of high-resolution two-photon imaging(7) to detect sensory-evoked calcium transients in single dendritic spines of mouse cortical neurons in vivo. Calcium signals evoked by sound stimulation required the activation of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors. Active spines are widely distributed on basal and apical dendrites and pure-tone stimulation at different frequencies revealed both narrowly and widely tuned spines. Notably, spines tuned for different frequencies were highly interspersed on the same dendrites: even neighbouring spines were mostly tuned to different frequencies. Thus, our results demonstrate that NMDA-receptor-dependent single-spine synaptic inputs to the same dendrite are highly heterogeneous.

The SidM/DrrA protein functions by locking the small GTPase Rab1 into an active form by its guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and AMPylation activity(2-4). Here we demonstrate that the L. pneumophila protein SidD preferably deAMPylates Rab1.

A molecular mechanism for the temporal control of Rab1 activity in different phases of L. pneumophila infection is thus established.

Here we present a theoretical treatment that converts three-dimensional affinities to two dimensions, accounting directly for the structure and dynamics of the membrane-bound molecules. Using a multiscale simulation approach, we apply the theory to explain the formation of ordered, junction-like clusters by classical cadherin adhesion proteins. The approach features atomic-scale molecular dynamics simulations to determine interdomain flexibility, Monte Carlo simulations of multidomain motion and lattice simulations of junction formation(3). A finding of general relevance is that changes in interdomain motion on trans-binding have a crucial role in driving the lateral, cis-, clustering of adhesion receptors.","[Ben-Shaul, Avinoam] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Inst Chem, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel; [Ben-Shaul, Avinoam] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Fritz Haber Res Ctr, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel; [Wu, Yinghao; Vendome, Jeremie; Shapiro, Lawrence; Honig, Barry] Columbia Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Wu, Yinghao; Vendome, Jeremie; Honig, Barry] Columbia Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Wu, Yinghao; Vendome, Jeremie; Honig, Barry] Columbia Univ, Ctr Computat Biol & Bioinformat, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Shapiro, Lawrence] Columbia Univ, Edward S Harkness Eye Inst, New York, NY 10032 USA","Ben-Shaul, A (reprint author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Inst Chem, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel.",abs@fh.huji.ac.il; bh6@columbia.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [MCB-0918535]; National Institutes of Health [R01 GM062270-07]; US-Israel Binational Science Foundation [2006-401]; Israel Science Foundation (ISF) [1448/10, 695/06]","This work was supported by National Science Foundation grant MCB-0918535 (to B.

The factors that are needed for the generation of T(H)17 cells have been well characterized(3-6). However, where and how the immune system controls T(H)17 cells in vivo remains unclear. Here, by using a model of tolerance induced by CD3-specific antibody, a model of sepsis and influenza A viral infection (H1N1), we show that pro-inflammatory T(H)17 cells can be redirected to and controlled in the small intestine. T(H)17-specific IL-17A secretion induced expression of the chemokine CCL20 in the small intestine, facilitating the migration of these cells specifically to the small intestine via the CCR6/CCL20 axis. Moreover, we found that T(H)17 cells are controlled by two different mechanisms in the small intestine: first, they are eliminated via the intestinal lumen; second, pro-inflammatory T(H)17 cells simultaneously acquire a regulatory phenotype within vitro and in vivo immune-suppressive properties (rT(H)17). These results identify mechanisms limiting T(H)17 cell pathogenicity and implicate the gastrointestinal tract as a site for control of T(H)17 cells.","[Esplugues, Enric; Huber, Samuel; O'Connor, William, Jr.; Rongvaux, Anthony; Herold, Kevan C.; Flavell, Richard A.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Immunobiol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Esplugues, Enric; Hauser, Anja E.] German Rheumatism Res Ctr DRFZ, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Esplugues, Enric] Charite, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Huber, Samuel] Univ Klinikum Hamburg Eppendorf, Med Klin 1, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany; [Gagliani, Nicola] San Raffaele Diabet Res Inst HSR DRI, I-20132 Milan, Italy; [Town, Terrence] Cedars Sinai Med Ctr, Dept Biomed Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90048 USA; [Town, Terrence] Cedars Sinai Med Ctr, Dept Neurosurg, Los Angeles, CA 90048 USA; [Town, Terrence] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Med, David Geffen Sch Med, Los Angeles, CA 90048 USA; [Wan, Yisong Y.] Univ N Carolina, Sch Med, Lineberger Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Van Rooijen, Nico] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Med, Dept Mol Cell Biol, NL-1081 BT Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Haberman, Ann M.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Lab Med, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Iwakura, Yoichiro] Univ Tokyo, Inst Med Sci, Ctr Med Expt, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; [Kuchroo, Vijay K.] Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Sch Med, Ctr Neurol Dis, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Kolls, Jay K.] LSU Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Genet, New Orleans, LA 70112 USA; [Bluestone, Jeffrey A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Ctr Diabet, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Flavell, Richard A.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, New Haven, CT 06510 USA","Esplugues, E (reprint author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Immunobiol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",enric.esplugues@yale.edu; richard.flavell@yale.edu,"Iwakura, Yoichiro/E-5457-2011","Iwakura, Yoichiro/0000-0002-9934-5775; Esplugues, Enric/0000-0002-9733-8707; Esplugues, Enric/0000-0002-8130-0413",National Multiple Sclerosis Society; DFG [HU 1714/1-1]; James Hudson Brown-Alexander B.

Recent studies indicated that this receptor controls follicular B-cell migration and T-cell-dependent antibody production(2-6). Oxysterols elicit profound effects on immune and inflammatory responses as well as on cholesterol metabolism(7-9). The biological effects of oxysterols have largely been credited to the activation of nuclear hormone receptors(10,11). Here we isolate oxysterols from porcine spleen extracts and show that they are endogenous ligands for EBI2. The most potent ligand and activator is 7 alpha,25-dihydroxycholesterol (OHC), with a dissociation constant of 450 pM for EBI2. In vitro, 7 alpha,25-OHC stimulated the migration of EBI2-expressing mouse B and T cells with half-maximum effective concentration values around 500 pM, but had no effect on EBI2-deficient cells. In vivo, EBI2-deficient B cells or normal B cells desensitized by 7 alpha,25-OHC pre-treatment showed reduced homing to follicular areas of the spleen. Blocking the synthesis of 7 alpha,25-OHC in vivo with clotrimazole, a CYP7B1 inhibitor, reduced the content of 7 alpha,25-OHC in the mouse spleen and promoted the migration of adoptively transferred pre-activated B cells to the T/B boundary (the boundary between the T-zone and B-zone in the spleen follicle), mimicking the phenotype of pre-activated B cells from EBI2-deficient mice. Our results show an unexpected causal link between EBI2, an orphan G-protein-coupled receptor controlling B-cell migration, and the known immunological effects of certain oxysterols, thus uncovering a previously unknown role for this class of molecules.","[Liu, Changlu; Yang, Xia V.; Wu, Jiejun; Kuei, Chester; Mani, Neelakandha S.; Zhang, Li; Yu, Jingxue; Sutton, Steven W.; Qin, Ning; Banie, Homayon; Karlsson, Lars; Sun, Siquan; Lovenberg, Timothy W.] Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceut Res & Dev LLC, San Diego, CA 92121 USA","Liu, CL (reprint author), Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceut Res & Dev LLC, 3210 Merryfield Row, San Diego, CA 92121 USA.",cliu9@its.jnj.com,,"Zhang, Li/0000-0001-6656-6064",,,,29,133,137,2,13,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Jul,2011,475,7357,,,,,519,U121,,10.1038/nature10226,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,797ZA,WOS:000293167900045,21796211.0,No,,,11/20/17,timothy w.,lovenberg,na,na,na,na,na

The natural ligand for EBI2 has been unknown. Here we describe the identification of 7 alpha,25-dihydroxycholesterol (also called 7 alpha,25-OHC or 5-cholesten-3 beta,7 alpha,25-triol) as a potent and selective agonist of EBI2. Functional activation of human EBI2 by 7 alpha,25-OHC and closely related oxysterols was verified by monitoring second messenger readouts and saturable, high-affinity radioligand binding. Furthermore, we find that 7 alpha,25-OHC and closely related oxysterols act as chemoattractants for immune cells expressing EBI2 by directing cell migration in vitro and in vivo. A critical enzyme required for the generation of 7 alpha,25-OHC is cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H)(4). Similar to EBI2 receptor knockout mice, mice deficient in CH25H fail to position activated B cells within the spleen to the outer follicle and mount a reduced plasma cell response after an immune challenge. This demonstrates that CH25H generates EBI2 biological activity in vivo and indicates that the EBI2-oxysterol signalling pathway has an important role in the adaptive immune response.","[Zhang, Juan; Guerini, Danilo; Baumgarten, Birgit U.; Roggo, Silvio; Knochenmuss, Richard; Gessier, Francois; Vanek, Mirka; Laurent, Stephane; Preuss, Inga; Miault, Charlotte; Christen, Isabelle; Karuna, Ratna; Suply, Thomas; Falchetto, Rocco; Katopodis, Andreas; Spanka, Carsten; Seuwen, Klaus; Sailer, Andreas W.] Novartis Inst BioMed Res, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; [Hannedouche, Sebastien; Noel, Sophie; Roy, Marie-Odile; Detheux, Michel] Euroscreen SA, B-6041 Gosselies, Belgium; [Yi, Tangsheng; Pereira, Joao P.; Kelly, Lisa M.; Cyster, Jason G.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Yi, Tangsheng; Pereira, Joao P.; Kelly, Lisa M.; Cyster, Jason G.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Shen, Weijun; Nguyen, Deborah; Wen, Ben; Li, Wei; Schmedt, Christian; Peters, Eric C.; Chen, Yu Alice; Schultz, Peter G.; Cho, Charles Y.] Novartis Res Fdn, Genom Inst, San Diego, CA 92121 USA; [Shen, Weijun; Koo, Dong-In] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Chem, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Sailer, AW (reprint author), Novartis Inst BioMed Res, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland.",andreas.sailer@novartis.com,"Karuna, Ratna/F-3653-2011; yi, tangsheng/E-5014-2011","Sailer, Andreas/0000-0002-9015-7946",Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NIAID NIH HHS [R01 AI040098],,,21,155,160,6,29,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Jul,2011,475,7357,,,,,524,527,,10.1038/nature10280,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,797ZA,WOS:000293167900046,21796212.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,andreas w.,sailer,na,na,na,na,na

Representative members of the family include preflagellin peptidase, type 4 prepilin peptidase, presenilin and signal peptide peptidase. Many GXGD proteases are important in medicine. For example, type 4 prepilin peptidase may contribute to bacterial pathogenesis(5-7), and mutations in presenilin are associated with Alzheimer's disease(8-10). As yet, there is no atomic-resolution structure in this protease family. Here we report the crystal structure of FlaK, a preflagellin peptidase from Methanococcus maripaludis, solved at 3.6 angstrom resolution. The structure contains six transmembrane helices. The GXGD motif and a short transmembrane helix, helix 4, are positioned at the centre, surrounded by other transmembrane helices. The crystal structure indicates that the protease must undergo conformational changes to bring the GXGD motif and a second essential aspartyl residue from transmembrane helix 1 into close proximity for catalysis. A comparison of the crystal structure with models of presenilin derived from biochemical analysis reveals three common transmembrane segments that are similarly arranged around the active site. This observation reinforces the idea that the prokaryotic and human proteases are evolutionarily related(11,12). The crystal structure presented here provides a framework for understanding the mechanism of the GXGD proteases, and may facilitate the rational design of inhibitors that target specific members of the family.","[Hu, Jian; Xue, Yi; Lee, Sangwon; Ha, Ya] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Ha, Y (reprint author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol, 333 Cedar St, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",ya.ha@yale.edu,,,"US Department of Energy; National Institutes of Health; Ellison Medical Foundation; Yale's programme in Cellular Neuroscience, Neurodegeneration, and Repair (CNNR)","We thank A.

Here we show that the type VI secretion system of Pseudomonas aeruginosa breaches this barrier to deliver two effector proteins, Tse1 and Tse3, to the periplasm of recipient cells. In this compartment, the effectors hydrolyse peptidoglycan, thereby providing a fitness advantage for P. aeruginosa cells in competition with other bacteria. To protect itself from lysis by Tse1 and Tse3, P. aeruginosa uses specific periplasmically localized immunity proteins.

Here we report the crystal structure of a voltage-gated Na+ channel from Arcobacter butzleri (NavAb) captured in a closed-pore conformation with four activated voltage sensors at 2.7 angstrom resolution. The arginine gating charges make multiple hydrophilic interactions within the voltage sensor, including unanticipated hydrogen bonds to the protein backbone. Comparisons to previous open-pore potassium channel structures indicate that the voltage-sensor domains and the S4-S5 linkers dilate the central pore by pivoting together around a hinge at the base of the pore module. The NavAb selectivity filter is short, similar to 4.6 angstrom wide, and water filled, with four acidic side chains surrounding the narrowest part of the ion conduction pathway. This unique structure presents a high-field-strength anionic coordination site, which confers Na+ selectivity through partial dehydration via direct interaction with glutamate side chains. Fenestrations in the sides of the pore module are unexpectedly penetrated by fatty acyl chains that extend into the central cavity, and these portals are large enough for the entry of small, hydrophobic pore-blocking drugs. This structure provides the template for understanding electrical signalling in excitable cells and the actions of drugs used for pain, epilepsy and cardiac arrhythmia at the atomic level.","[Payandeh, Jian; Scheuer, Todd; Zheng, Ning; Catterall, William A.] Univ Washington, Dept Pharmacol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Zheng, Ning] Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Zheng, N (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Pharmacol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",nzheng@uw.edu; wcatt@uw.edu,,,"Canadian Institutes of Health Research; National Institutes of Health [R01 NS15751, U01 NS058039]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute",We thank B.

Analogous cooling techniques(3,4) can provide a general and flexible method of preparing macroscopic objects in their motional ground state. Cavity optomechanical or electromechanical systems achieve sideband cooling through the strong interaction between light and motion(5-15). However, entering the quantum regime-in which a system has less than a single quantum of motion-has been difficult because sideband cooling has not sufficiently overwhelmed the coupling of low-frequency mechanical systems to their hot environments. Here we demonstrate sideband cooling of an approximately 10-MHz micromechanical oscillator to the quantum ground state. This achievement required a large electromechanical interaction, which was obtained by embedding a micromechanical membrane into a superconducting microwave resonant circuit. To verify the cooling of the membrane motion to a phonon occupation of 0.34 +/- 0.05 phonons, we perform a near Heisenberg-limited position measurement(3) within (5.1 +/- 0.4)h/2 pi, where h is Planck's constant. Furthermore, our device exhibits strong coupling, allowing coherent exchange of microwave photons and mechanical phonons(16). Simultaneously achieving strong coupling, ground state preparation and efficient measurement sets the stage for rapid advances in the control and detection of non-classical states of motion(17,18), possibly even testing quantum theory itself in the unexplored region of larger size and mass(19). Because mechanical oscillators can couple to light of any frequency, they could also serve as a unique intermediary for transferring quantum information between microwave and optical domains(20).","[Teufel, J.

Whether based on inorganic(2-5) or organic(6-8) materials, the devices that show the highest performance rely on single-crystal interfaces, with their nearly perfect translational symmetry and exceptionally high chemical purity. Attention has recently been focused on developing simple ways of producing electronic devices by means of printing technologies. 'Printed electronics' is being explored for the manufacture of large-area and flexible electronic devices by the patterned application of functional inks containing soluble or dispersed semiconducting materials(9-11). However, because of the strong self-organizing tendency of the deposited materials(12,13), the production of semiconducting thin films of high crystallinity (indispensable for realizing high carrier mobility) may be incompatible with conventional printing processes. Here we develop a method that combines the technique of antisolvent crystallization(14) with inkjet printing to produce organic semiconducting thin films of high crystallinity. Specifically, we show that mixing fine droplets of an antisolvent and a solution of an active semiconducting component within a confined area on an amorphous substrate can trigger the controlled formation of exceptionally uniform single-crystal or polycrystalline thin films that grow at the liquid-air interfaces. Using this approach, we have printed single crystals of the organic semiconductor 2,7-dioctyl[1] benzothieno[3,2-b][1] benzothiophene (C(8)-BTBT) (ref. 15), yielding thin-film transistors with average carrier mobilities as high as 16.4 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1). This printing technique constitutes a major step towards the use of high-performance single-crystal semiconductor devices for large-area and flexible electronics applications.","[Minemawari, Hiromi; Yamada, Toshikazu; Matsui, Hiroyuki; Tsutsumi, Jun'ya; Haas, Simon; Chiba, Ryosuke; Kumai, Reiji; Hasegawa, Tatsuo] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058562, Japan; [Chiba, Ryosuke] Univ Tokyo, Dept Appl Phys, Hongo 1138656, Japan; [Kumai, Reiji] High Energy Accelerator Res Org KEK, Inst Mat Struct Sci, CMRC, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050801, Japan","Hasegawa, T (reprint author), Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, AIST Tsukuba Cent 4, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058562, Japan.",t-hasegawa@aist.go.jp,"Tsutsumi, Jun'ya/O-6490-2016; Kumai, Reiji/R-2453-2017","Tsutsumi, Jun'ya/0000-0002-0910-1188; Kumai, Reiji/0000-0002-5320-0028; Yamada, Toshikazu/0000-0002-8322-2391; Hasegawa, Tatsuo/0000-0001-5187-7433",New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS),"We are grateful to Nippon Kayaku for providing C<INF>8</INF>-BTBT.

Yet before neuron-based brains evolved, complex biomolecular circuits provided individual cells with the 'intelligent' behaviour required for survival(2). However, the study of how molecules can 'think' has not produced an equal variety of computational models and applications of artificial chemical systems. Although biomolecular systems have been hypothesized to carry out neural-network-like computations in vivo(3,2,4) and the synthesis of artificial chemical analogues has been proposed theoretically(5-9), experimental work(10-13) has so far fallen short of fully implementing even a single neuron. Here, building on the richness of DNA computing(14) and strand displacement circuitry(15), we show how molecular systems can exhibit autonomous brain-like behaviours. Using a simple DNA gate architecture(16) that allows experimental scale-up of multilayer digital circuits(17), we systematically transform arbitrary linear threshold circuits(18) (an artificial neural network model) into DNA strand displacement cascades that function as small neural networks. Our approach even allows us to implement a Hopfield associative memory(19) with four fully connected artificial neurons that, after training in silico, remembers four single-stranded DNA patterns and recalls the most similar one when presented with an incomplete pattern. Our results suggest that DNA strand displacement cascades could be used to endow autonomous chemical systems with the capability of recognizing patterns of molecular events, making decisions and responding to the environment.","[Qian, Lulu; Winfree, Erik; Bruck, Jehoshua] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Winfree, E (reprint author), CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",winfree@caltech.edu,"Winfree, Erik/L-4002-2013","Winfree, Erik/0000-0002-5899-7523","NSF [0728703, 0832824]; HFSP award [RGY0074/2006-C]","We thank P.

Massive earthquakes with a moment magnitude, M-w, of nine have been known to occur in only a few areas, including Chile, Alaska, Kamchatka and Sumatra. No historical records exist of a M-w = 9 earthquake along the Japan trench, where the Pacific plate subducts beneath the Okhotsk plate, with the possible exception of the AD 869 Jogan earthquake(1), the magnitude of which has not been well constrained. However, the strain accumulation rate estimated there from recent geodetic observations is much higher than the average strain rate released in previous interplate earthquakes(2-6). This finding raises the question of how such areas release the accumulated strain. A megathrust earthquake with M-w = 9.0 (hereafter referred to as the Tohoku-Oki earthquake) occurred on 11 March 2011, rupturing the plate boundary off the Pacific coast of northeastern Japan. Here we report the distributions of the coseismic slip and postseismic slip as determined from ground displacement detected using a network based on the Global Positioning System. The coseismic slip area extends approximately 400 km along the Japan trench, matching the area of the pre-seismic locked zone(4). The afterslip has begun to overlap the coseismic slip area and extends into the surrounding region. In particular, the afterslip area reached a depth of approximately 100 km, with M-w = 8.3, on 25 March 2011. Because the Tohoku-Oki earthquake released the strain accumulated for several hundred years, the paradox of the strain budget imbalance may be partly resolved. This earthquake reminds us of the potential for M-w approximate to 9 earthquakes to occur along other trench systems, even if no past evidence of such events exists. Therefore, it is imperative that strain accumulation be monitored using a space geodetic technique to assess earthquake potential.","[Ozawa, Shinzaburo; Nishimura, Takuya; Suito, Hisashi; Kobayashi, Tomokazu; Tobita, Mikio; Imakiire, Tetsuro] Geospatial Informat Author Japan, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050811, Japan","Ozawa, S (reprint author), Geospatial Informat Author Japan, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050811, Japan.",ozawa@gsi.go.jp,"Nishimura, Takuya/G-2789-2013",,,,,37,363,384,15,128,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,21-Jul,2011,475,7356,,,,,373,U123,,10.1038/nature10227,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,794PA,WOS:000292911200041,21677648.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,tetsuro,imakiire,male,1,2,na,na

The BLA projection to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is thought to modulate cue-triggered motivated behaviours(4,6,7,24,25), but our understanding of the interaction between these two brain regions has been limited by the inability to manipulate neural-circuit elements of this pathway selectively during behaviour. To circumvent this limitation, we used in vivo optogenetic stimulation or inhibition of glutamatergic fibres from the BLA to the NAc, coupled with intracranial pharmacology and ex vivo electrophysiology. Here we show that optical stimulation of the pathway from the BLA to the NAc in mice reinforces behavioural responding to earn additional optical stimulation of these synaptic inputs. Optical stimulation of these glutamatergic fibres required intra-NAc dopamine D1-type receptor signalling, but not D2-type receptor signalling. Brief optical inhibition of fibres from the BLA to the NAc reduced cue-evoked intake of sucrose, demonstrating an important role of this specific pathway in controlling naturally occurring reward-related behaviour. Moreover, although optical stimulation of glutamatergic fibres from the medial prefrontal cortex to the NAc also elicited reliable excitatory synaptic responses, optical self-stimulation behaviour was not observed by activation of this pathway. These data indicate that whereas the BLA is important for processing both positive and negative affect, the glutamatergic pathway from the BLA to the NAc, in conjunction with dopamine signalling in the NAc, promotes motivated behavioural responding. Thus, optogenetic manipulation of anatomically distinct synaptic inputs to the NAc reveals functionally distinct properties of these inputs in controlling reward-seeking behaviours.","[Stuber, Garret D.; Sparta, Dennis R.; Stamatakis, Alice M.] Univ N Carolina, UNC Neurosci Ctr, Dept Psychiat, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Stuber, Garret D.; Sparta, Dennis R.; Stamatakis, Alice M.] Univ N Carolina, UNC Neurosci Ctr, Dept Cell & Mol Physiol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Stuber, Garret D.; Sparta, Dennis R.; van Leeuwen, Wieke A.; Hardjoprajitno, Juanita E.; Cho, Saemi; Tye, Kay M.; Kempadoo, Kimberly A.; Bonci, Antonello] Univ Calif San Francisco, Wheeler Ctr Neurobiol Drug Addict, Dept Neurol, Ernest Gallo Clin & Res Ctr, San Francisco, CA 94608 USA; [Tye, Kay M.; Zhang, Feng; Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Tye, Kay M.; Zhang, Feng; Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Dept Bioengn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Bonci, Antonello] NIDA, Intramural Res Program, Baltimore, MD 21224 USA","Stuber, GD (reprint author), Univ N Carolina, UNC Neurosci Ctr, Dept Psychiat, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",gstuber@med.unc.edu,"Tye, Kay/J-6158-2013; Stuber, Garret/E-1160-2011","Tye, Kay/0000-0002-2435-0182; Stuber, Garret/0000-0003-1730-4855",NARSAD; ABMRF; Foundation of Hope; NIDA [DA029325]; Psychiatry Department at UNC Chapel Hill; State of California through the University of California at San Francisco;  [F32AA018610],"We thank J.

Dlk1, a member of a cluster of imprinted genes, is expressed from the paternally inherited chromosome(1,2). Here we show that mice that are deficient in Dlk1 have defects in postnatal neurogenesis in the subventricular zone: a developmental continuum that results in depletion of mature neurons in the olfactory bulb. We show that DLK1 is secreted by niche astrocytes, whereas its membrane-bound isoform is present in neural stem cells (NSCs) and is required for the inductive effect of secreted DLK1 on self-renewal. Notably, we find that there is a requirement for Dlk1 to be expressed from both maternally and paternally inherited chromosomes. Selective absence of Dlk1 imprinting in both NSCs and niche astrocytes is associated with postnatal acquisition of DNA methylation at the germ-line-derived imprinting control region. The results emphasize molecular relationships between NSCs and the niche astrocyte cells of the microenvironment, identifying a signalling system encoded by a single gene that functions coordinately in both cell types. The modulation of genomic imprinting in a stem-cell environment adds a new level of epigenetic regulation to the establishment and maintenance of the niche, raising wider questions about the adaptability, function and evolution of imprinting in specific developmental contexts.","[Ferron, Sacri R.; Charalambous, Marika; Radford, Elizabeth; McEwen, Kirsten; Hind, Eleanor; Ferguson-Smith, Anne C.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Physiol Dev & Neurosci, Cambridge CB2 3EG, England; [Wildner, Hendrik; Guillemot, Francois] Natl Inst Med Res, MRC, Dept Mol Neurobiol, London NW7 1AA, England; [Manuel Morante-Redolat, Jose; Farinas, Isabel] Univ Valencia, Ctr Invest Biomed Red Enfermedades Neurodegenerat, Dept Biol Celular, E-46100 Burjassot, Spain; [Laborda, Jorge] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Reg Ctr Biomed Res, Sch Med, Dept Inorgan & Organ Chem & Biochem, Albacete 02006, Spain; [Bauer, Steven R.] US FDA, Cellular & Tissue Therapies Branch, Div Cellular & Gene Therapies, Ctr Biol Evaluat & Res, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Ferguson-Smith, AC (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Physiol Dev & Neurosci, Cambridge CB2 3EG, England.",afsmith@mole.bio.cam.ac.uk,"Ferguson-Smith, Anne/G-7534-2011; Bauer, Steven/G-5559-2012; Laborda, Jorge/L-5726-2014; Farinas, Isabel/L-7118-2014; Ferron, Sacri/I-2958-2015","Laborda, Jorge/0000-0002-9210-838X; Farinas, Isabel/0000-0003-2903-4960; Ferron, Sacri/0000-0003-0854-8575; Bauer, Steven/0000-0003-2831-846X; Charalambous, Marika/0000-0002-1684-5783; McEwen, Kirsten/0000-0002-9173-5664","Medical Research Council; Wellcome Trust; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion [SAF2008-01006, CB06/05/0086, RD06/0010/0010]; Generalitat Valenciana (Prometeo); University of Cambridge","We are grateful to J.

Induced hepatic differentiation has been achieved previously using embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells(2-8). Particularly, hepatocytes generated froma patient's own induced pluripotent stem cells could theoretically avoid immunological rejection. However, the induction of hepatocytes frominduced pluripotent stem cells is a complicated process that would probably be replaced with the arrival of improved technology. Overexpression of lineage-specific transcription factors directly converts terminally differentiated cells into some other lineages(9-12), including neurons(13), cardiomyocytes(14) and blood progenitors(15); however, it remains unclear whether these lineage-converted cells could repair damaged tissues in vivo. Here we demonstrate the direct induction of functional hepatocytelike (iHep) cells from mouse tail-tip fibroblasts by transduction of Gata4, Hnf1 alpha and Foxa3, and inactivation of p19(Arf). iHep cells show typical epithelial morphology, express hepatic genes and acquire hepatocyte functions. Notably, transplanted iHep cells repopulate the livers of fumarylacetoacetate-hydrolase-deficient (Fah(-/-)) mice and rescue almost half of recipients from death by restoring liver functions. Our study provides a novel strategy to generate functional hepatocyte-like cells for the purpose of liver engineering and regenerative medicine.","[Huang, Pengyu; He, Zhiying; Ji, Shuyi; Sun, Huawang; Liu, Changcheng; Hu, Yiping; Wang, Xin; Hui, Lijian] Chinese Acad Sci, Lab Mol Cell Biol, Inst Biochem & Cell Biol, Shanghai Inst Biol Sci, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China; [He, Zhiying; Xiang, Dao; Liu, Changcheng; Hu, Yiping] Second Mil Med Univ, Dept Cell Biol, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xin] Univ Minnesota, Dept Lab Med & Pathol, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Wang, Xin] Univ Minnesota, Stem Cell Inst, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Hui, LJ (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Lab Mol Cell Biol, Inst Biochem & Cell Biol, Shanghai Inst Biol Sci, Yueyang Rd 320, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China.",ljhui@sibs.ac.cn,,,"National Science Foundation of China [91019014, 30801115]; Chinese Academy of Sciences [KSCX2-YW-R-241, XDA01010402]; Chinese National 863 Plan Project [2006AA02Z474]; National Key Basic Research and Development Program of China [2007CB947102, 2009CB941100]","We would like to thank X.

Normally, hepatocytes differentiate from hepatic progenitor cells to form the liver during development(1,2). However, previous studies have shown that the hepatic program can also be activated in non-hepatic lineage cells after exposure to particular stimuli or fusion with hepatocytes(3-9). These unexpected findings suggest that factors critical to hepatocyte differentiation exist and become activated to induce hepatocyte-specific properties in different cell types. Here, by screening the effects of twelve candidate factors, we identify three specific combinations of two transcription factors, comprising Hnf4 alpha plus Foxa1, Foxa2 or Foxa3, that can convert mouse embryonic and adult fibroblasts into cells that closely resemble hepatocytes in vitro. The induced hepatocyte-like (iHep) cells have multiple hepatocyte-specific features and reconstitute damaged hepatic tissues after transplantation.

Membrane proteins that fail targeting must be rapidly degraded to avoid aggregation and disruption of cytosolic protein homeostasis(2,3). The mechanisms of mislocalized protein (MLP) degradation are unknown. Here we reconstitute MLP degradation in vitro to identify factors involved in this pathway. We find that nascent membrane proteins tethered to ribosomes are not substrates for ubiquitination unless they are released into the cytosol. Their inappropriate release results in capture by the Bag6 complex, a recently identified ribosome-associating chaperone(4). Bag6-complex-mediated capture depends on the presence of unprocessed or non-inserted hydrophobic domains that distinguish MLPs from potential cytosolic proteins. A subset of these Bag6 complex 'clients' are transferred to TRC40 for insertion into the membrane, whereas the remainder are rapidly ubiquitinated. Depletion of the Bag6 complex selectively impairs the efficient ubiquitination of MLPs. Thus, by its presence on ribosomes that are synthesizing nascent membrane proteins, the Bag6 complex links targeting and ubiquitination pathways. We propose that such coupling allows the fast tracking of MLPs for degradation without futile engagement of the cytosolic folding machinery.","[Hessa, Tara; Sharma, Ajay; Mariappan, Malaiyalam; Eshleman, Heather D.; Gutierrez, Erik; Hegde, Ramanujan S.] NICHHD, Cell Biol & Metab Program, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Gutierrez, Erik] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Biol, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA","Hegde, RS (reprint author), MRC, Mol Biol Lab, Hills Rd, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England.",hegde.science@gmail.com,"mariappan, malaiyalam/K-9024-2012","Hegde, Ramanujan/0000-0001-8338-852X",National Institutes of Health; Wenner-Gren Foundations,"We are grateful to E.

Light and the circadian clock interact to consolidate the phase of hypocotyl cell elongation to peak at dawn under diurnal cycles in Arabidopsis thaliana(4-7). Here we identify a protein complex (called the evening complex)-composed of the proteins encoded by EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3), ELF4 and the transcription-factor-encoding gene LUX ARRHYTHMO (LUX; also known as PHYTOCLOCK 1)-that directly regulates plant growth(8-12). ELF3 is both necessary and sufficient to form a complex between ELF4 and LUX, and the complex is diurnally regulated, peaking at dusk. ELF3, ELF4 and LUX are required for the proper expression of the growth-promoting transcription factors encoded by PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 4 (PIF4) and PIF5 (also known as PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 3-LIKE 6) under diurnal conditions(4,6,13). LUX targets the complex to the promoters of PIF4 and PIF5 in vivo. Mutations in PIF4 and/or PIF5 are epistatic to the loss of the ELF4-ELF3-LUX complex, suggesting that regulation of PIF4 and PIF5 is a crucial function of the complex.

It has been suggested that ATP-driven motor activity along DNA disrupts target protein-DNA interactions in the remodelling reaction(3-5). However, the complex and highly specific remodelling reactions are poorly understood, mostly because of a lack of high-resolution structural information about how remodellers bind to their substrate proteins. Mot1 (modifier of transcription 1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, denoted BTAF1 in humans) is a Swi2/Snf2 enzyme that specifically displaces the TATA box binding protein (TBP) from the promoter DNA and regulates transcription globally by generating a highly dynamic TBP pool in the cell(6,7). As a Swi2/Snf2 enzyme that functions as a single polypeptide and interacts with a relatively simple substrate, Mot1 offers an ideal system from which to gain a better understanding of this important enzyme family. To reveal how Mot1 specifically disrupts TBP-DNA complexes, we combined crystal and electron microscopy structures of Mot1-TBP from Encephalitozoon cuni-culi with biochemical studies. Here we show that Mot1 wraps around TBP and seems to act like a bottle opener: a spring-like array of 16 HEAT(huntingtin, elongation factor 3, protein phosphatase 2A and lipid kinase TOR) repeats grips the DNA-distal side of TBP via loop insertions, and the Swi2/Snf2 domain binds to upstream DNA, positioned to weaken the TBP-DNA interaction by DNA translocation. A 'latch' subsequently blocks the DNA-binding groove of TBP, acting as a chaperone to prevent DNA re-association and ensure efficient promoter clearance. This work shows how a remodelling enzyme can combine both motor and chaperone activities to achieve functional specificity using a conserved Swi2/Snf2 translocase.","[Wollmann, Petra; Cui, Sheng; Berninghausen, Otto; Moldt, Manuela; Witte, Gregor; Butryn, Agata; Wendler, Petra; Beckmann, Roland; Hopfner, Karl-Peter] Univ Munich, Dept Biochem, D-81377 Munich, Germany; [Wollmann, Petra; Witte, Gregor; Hopfner, Karl-Peter] Gene Ctr Munich, Munich Ctr Adv Photon, D-81377 Munich, Germany; [Viswanathan, Ramya; Wells, Melissa N.; Auble, David T.] Univ Virginia Hlth Syst, Dept Biochem & Mol Genet, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Witte, Gregor; Beckmann, Roland; Hopfner, Karl-Peter] Gene Ctr Munich, Ctr Integrated Prot Sci, D-81377 Munich, Germany","Hopfner, KP (reprint author), Univ Munich, Dept Biochem, Feodor Lynen Str 25, D-81377 Munich, Germany.",auble@virginia.edu; hopfner@lmb.uni-muenchen.de,"Wendler, Petra/C-9056-2014; Hopfner, Karl-Peter/B-6864-2014","Hopfner, Karl-Peter/0000-0002-4528-8357; Witte, Gregor/0000-0003-0313-0962; CUI, Sheng/0000-0001-6329-3582; Butryn, Agata/0000-0002-5227-4770","German Research Council [SFB 646, SFB/TR5]; Excellence Initiative (Center for Integrated Protein Science, Munich); DFG [WE4628/1]; NIH [GM55763]","We thank the Max-Planck Crystallization Facility Martinsried.

Although it is often well understood how a given domain recognizes a cognate oligonucleotide or peptide motif, the dynamic interaction of multiple domains in the recognition of these ligands remains to be characterized. Here we have studied the molecular mechanisms of the recognition of the 3'-splice-site-associated polypyrimidine tract RNA by the large subunit of the human U2 snRNP auxiliary factor (U2AF65)(1-3) as a key early step in pre-mRNA splicing(4). We show that the tandem RNA recognition motif domains of U2AF65 adopt two remarkably distinct domain arrangements in the absence or presence of a strong (that is, high affinity) polypyrimidine tract. Recognition of sequence variations in the polypyrimidine tract RNA involves a population shift between these closed and open conformations. The equilibrium between the two conformations functions as a molecular rheostat that quantitatively correlates the natural variations in polypyrimidine tract nucleotide composition, length and functional strength to the efficiency to recruit U2 snRNP to the intron during spliceosome assembly(1,5-8). Mutations that shift the conformational equilibrium without directly affecting RNA binding modulate splicing activity accordingly. Similar mechanisms of cooperative multi-domain conformational selection may operate more generally in the recognition of degenerate nucleotide or amino acid motifs by multi-domain proteins(9,10).","[Mackereth, Cameron D.; Madl, Tobias; Sattler, Michael] Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Inst Struct Biol, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany; [Mackereth, Cameron D.] Univ Bordeaux, F-33607 Pessac, France; [Mackereth, Cameron D.] Inst Europe Chim & Biol, F-33607 Pessac, France; [Mackereth, Cameron D.; Simon, Bernd; Zanier, Katia; Gasch, Alexander; Rybin, Vladimir; Sattler, Michael] European Mol Biol Lab, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Madl, Tobias; Sattler, Michael] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Chem, Munich Ctr Integrated Prot Sci, D-85747 Garching, Germany; [Bonnal, Sophie; Valcarcel, Juan] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Ctr Regulacio Genom, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Valcarcel, Juan] Inst Catalana Recerca & Estudis Avancats, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Madl, Tobias; Sattler, Michael] Tech Univ Munich, Chair Biomol NMR, Dept Chem, D-85747 Garching, Germany","Sattler, M (reprint author), Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Inst Struct Biol, Ingolstadter Landstr 1, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany.",sattler@helmholtz-muenchen.de,"Madl, Tobias/B-1682-2012; Valcarcel, Juan/O-9814-2014; Sattler, Michael/A-2407-2012; Mackereth, Cameron/F-7946-2013","Madl, Tobias/0000-0002-9725-5231; Valcarcel, Juan/0000-0001-5398-3571; Sattler, Michael/0000-0002-1594-0527; Mackereth, Cameron/0000-0002-0776-7947; Simon, Bernd/0000-0003-0164-5516",EMBO Long Term Fellowship; ICSN; Aquitaine regional government; Austrian Science Fund (FWF); EMBO; European Commission [226507]; EURASNET; AICR; Fundacion Marcelino Botin; ICREA,"We thank F.

It is clonally propagated, highly heterozygous, autotetraploid, and suffers acute inbreeding depression. Here we use a homozygous doubled-monoploid potato clone to sequence and assemble 86% of the 844-megabase genome. We predict 39,031 protein-coding genes and present evidence for at least two genome duplication events indicative of a palaeopolyploid origin. As the first genome sequence of an asterid, the potato genome reveals 2,642 genes specific to this large angiosperm clade. We also sequenced a heterozygous diploid clone and show that gene presence/absence variants and other potentially deleterious mutations occur frequently and are a likely cause of inbreeding depression. Gene family expansion, tissue-specific expression and recruitment of genes to new pathways contributed to the evolution of tuber development. The potato genome sequence provides a platform for genetic improvement of this vital crop.","[Huang, Sanwen; Zhang, Zhonghua; Liang, Chunbo; He, Jun; Li, Ying; He, Ying; Xu, Jianfei; Zhang, Youjun; Xie, Binyan; Du, Yongchen; Qu, Dongyu] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Key Lab Hort Crops Genet Improvement, Sino Dutch Joint Lab Hort Genom, Inst Vegetables & Flowers,Minist Agr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Xu, Xun; Pan, Shengkai; Cheng, Shifeng; Zhang, Bo; Mu, Desheng; Ni, Peixiang; Zhang, Gengyun; Yang, Shuang; Li, Ruiqiang; Wang, Jun] Chinese Minist Agr, Key Lab Genom, BGI Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, Peoples R China; [Orjeda, Gisella; Guzman, Frank; Torres, Michael; Lozano, Roberto; Ponce, Olga; Martinez, Diana; De la Cruz, German] Cayetano Heredia Univ, Genom Res Unit, Lima 13, Peru; [Orjeda, Gisella; Guzman, Frank; Torres, Michael; Lozano, Roberto; Ponce, Olga; Martinez, Diana; De la Cruz, German] San Cristobal Huamanga Univ, Biotechnol & Plant Genet Lab, Ayacucho, Peru; [Chakrabarti, S.

The effects of impaired breathing are a leading cause of death from spinal cord injuries, underscoring the importance of developing strategies to restore respiratory activity. Here we show that, after cervical spinal cord injury, the expression of chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans (CSPGs) associated with the perineuronal net (PNN) is upregulated around the phrenic motor neurons. Digestion of these potently inhibitory extracellular matrix molecules with chondroitinase ABC (denoted ChABC) could, by itself, promote the plasticity of tracts that were spared and restore limited activity to the paralysed diaphragm. However, when combined with a peripheral nerve autograft, ChABC treatment resulted in lengthy regeneration of serotonin-containing axons and other bulbospinal fibres and remarkable recovery of diaphragmatic function. After recovery and initial transection of the graft bridge, there was an unusual, overall increase in tonic electromyographic activity of the diaphragm, suggesting that considerable remodelling of the spinal cord circuitry occurs after regeneration. This increase was followed by complete elimination of the restored activity, proving that regeneration is crucial for the return of function. Overall, these experiments present a way to markedly restore the function of a single muscle after debilitating trauma to the central nervous system, through both promoting the plasticity of spared tracts and regenerating essential pathways.","[Alilain, Warren J.; Horn, Kevin P.; Hu, Hongmei; Dick, Thomas E.; Silver, Jerry] Case Western Reserve Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Dick, Thomas E.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Sch Med, Div Pulm Crit Care & Sleep Med, Dept Med, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA","Silver, J (reprint author), Case Western Reserve Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, 2109 Adelbert Rd, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",wja4@case.edu; jxs10@case.edu,,,"Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation; International Spinal Research Trust; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke [NS25713, NS060767]; National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute [HL080318]; Brumagin Memorial Fund; Ellen Becker Neuroscience Regenerative Medicine Research Fund","This project was funded by The Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation (W.J.A.), the International Spinal Research Trust (W.J.A.), the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, grants NS25713 and NS060767 (J.S.), and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, grant HL080318 (T.

Accurate processing by Dicer is crucial for the functionality of microRNAs (miRNAs). The current model posits that Dicer selects cleavage sites by measuring a set distance from the 3' overhang of the double-stranded RNA terminus. Here we report that human Dicer anchors not only the 3' end but also the 5' end, with the cleavage site determined mainly by the distance (similar to 2 nucleotides) from the 5' end (5' counting rule). This cleavage requires a 5'-terminal phosphate group. Further, we identify a novel basic motif (5' pocket) in human Dicer that recognizes the 5'-phosphorylated end. The 5' counting rule and the 5' anchoring residues are conserved in Drosophila Dicer-1, but not in Giardia Dicer. Mutations in the 5' pocket reduce processing efficiency and alter cleavage sites in vitro. Consistently, miRNA biogenesis is perturbed in vivo when Dicer-null embryonic stem cells are replenished with the 5'-pocket mutant. Thus, 5'-end recognition by Dicer is important for precise and effective biogenesis of miRNAs. Insights from this study should also afford practical benefits to the design of small hairpin RNAs.","[Park, Jong-Eun; Heo, Inha; Chang, Hyeshik; Jee, David; Kim, V.

Hydrodynamic simulations show that these giant planets can undergo a two-stage, inward-then-outward, migration(3-5). The terrestrial planets finished accreting much later(6), and their characteristics, including Mars' small mass, are best reproduced by starting from a planetesimal disk with an outer edge at about one astronomical unit from the Sun(7,8) (1 AU is the Earth-Sun distance). Here we report simulations of the early Solar System that show how the inward migration of Jupiter to 1.5 AU, and its subsequent outward migration, lead to a planetesimal disk truncated at 1 AU; the terrestrial planets then form from this disk over the next 30-50 million years, with an Earth/Mars mass ratio consistent with observations. Scattering by Jupiter initially empties but then repopulates the asteroid belt, with inner-belt bodies originating between 1 and 3 AU and outer-belt bodies originating between and beyond the giant planets. This explains the significant compositional differences across the asteroid belt. The key aspect missing from previous models of terrestrial planet formation is the substantial radial migration of the giant planets, which suggests that their behaviour is more similar to that inferred for extrasolar planets than previously thought.","[Walsh, Kevin J.; Morbidelli, Alessandro] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, CNRS, Observ Cote Azur, F-06304 Nice 4, France; [Walsh, Kevin J.] SW Res Inst, Dept Space Studies, Boulder, CO 80302 USA; [Raymond, Sean N.] Univ Bordeaux, Observ Aquitain Sci Univers, F-33270 Floirac, France; [Raymond, Sean N.] CNRS, UMR 5804, Lab Astrophys Bordeaux, F-33270 Floirac, France; [O'Brien, David P.] Planetary Sci Inst, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA; [Mandell, Avi M.] NASA Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA","Walsh, KJ (reprint author), Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, CNRS, Observ Cote Azur, BP 4229, F-06304 Nice 4, France.",kwalsh@boulder.swri.edu,"Mandell, Avi/F-9361-2012",,Helmholtz Alliances; CNRS; NASA; Goddard Center for Astrobiology,K.J.W. and A.

Real measurements, however, almost always cause a much stronger back-action than is required by the laws of quantum mechanics. Quantum non-demolition measurements have been devised(1-6) that keep the additional back-action entirely within observables other than the one being measured. However, this back-action on other observables often imposes its own constraints. In particular, free-space optical detection methods for single atoms and ions (such as the shelving technique(7), a sensitive and well-developed method) inevitably require spontaneous scattering, even in the dispersive regime(8). This causes irreversible energy exchange (heating), which is a limitation in atom-based quantum information processing, where it obviates straightforward reuse of the qubit. No such energy exchange is required by quantum mechanics(9). Here we experimentally demonstrate optical detection of an atomic qubit with significantly less than one spontaneous scattering event. We measure the transmission and reflection of an optical cavity(10-13) containing the atom. In addition to the qubit detection itself, we quantitatively measure how much spontaneous scattering has occurred. This allows us to relate the information gained to the amount of spontaneous emission, and we obtain a detection error below 10 per cent while scattering less than 0.2 photons on average. Furthermore, we performa quantum Zeno-type experiment to quantify the measurement back-action, and find that every incident photon leads to an almost complete state collapse. Together, these results constitute a full experimental characterization of a quantum measurement in the 'energy exchange-free' regime below a single spontaneous emission event. Besides its fundamental interest, this approach could significantly simplify proposed neutral-atom quantum computation schemes(14), and may enable sensitive detection of molecules and atoms lacking closed transitions.","[Volz, Juergen; Gehr, Roger; Dubois, Guilhem; Esteve, Jerome; Reichel, Jakob] Univ Paris 06, CNRS, ENS, Lab Kastler Brossel, F-75005 Paris, France","Reichel, J (reprint author), Univ Paris 06, CNRS, ENS, Lab Kastler Brossel, 24 Rue Lhomond, F-75005 Paris, France.",jakob.reichel@ens.fr,"Esteve, Jerome/G-1084-2014; Volz, Jurgen/N-6457-2016","Esteve, Jerome/0000-0002-1556-8120; Volz, Jurgen/0000-0002-3174-2141; Reichel, Jakob/0000-0003-3420-4178",EU [247687]; Institut Francilien pour la Recherche sur les Atomes Froids (IFRAF); EURYI grant 'Integrated Quantum Devices',"This work was funded in part by the AQUTE Integrated Project of the EU (grant no. 247687), by the Institut Francilien pour la Recherche sur les Atomes Froids (IFRAF), and by the EURYI grant 'Integrated Quantum Devices'.",,26,49,49,0,18,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,14-Jul,2011,475,7355,,,,,210,U117,,10.1038/nature10225,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,791UA,WOS:000292690500046,21753851.0,No,,,11/20/17,jakob,reichel,male,0.99,148,EOrqDVAAAAAJ,8184

In turn, these changes might be expected to alter the production and consumption of the important greenhouse gases nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) (refs 2, 3). However, studies on fluxes of N2O and CH4 from soil under increased atmospheric CO2 have not been quantitatively synthesized. Here we show, using meta-analysis, that increased CO2 (ranging from 463 to 780 parts per million by volume) stimulates both N2O emissions from upland soils and CH4 emissions from rice paddies and natural wetlands. Because enhanced greenhouse-gas emissions add to the radiative forcing of terrestrial ecosystems, these emissions are expected to negate at least 16.6 per cent of the climate change mitigation potential previously predicted from an increase in the terrestrial carbon sink under increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations(4). Our results therefore suggest that the capacity of land ecosystems to slow climate warming has been overestimated.","[van Groenigen, Kees Jan; Hungate, Bruce A.] No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [van Groenigen, Kees Jan; Hungate, Bruce A.] No Arizona Univ, Merriam Powell Ctr Environm Res, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [van Groenigen, Kees Jan] Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Nat Sci, Dept Bot, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Osenberg, Craig W.] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","van Groenigen, KJ (reprint author), No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Box 5640, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",cjvangroenigen@nau.edu,"van Groenigen, Kees Jan/B-3747-2012; Hungate, Bruce/F-8991-2011; Osenberg, Craig/M-9904-2013","Hungate, Bruce/0000-0002-7337-1887; van groenigen, kees jan/0000-0002-9165-3925; Osenberg, Craig/0000-0003-1918-7904","DOE-NICCR; NSF [DEB-0949460]; Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology; Marie Curie Actions under FP7","We thank S.

Genome editing improves on simple gene-replacement strategies by effecting in situ correction of a mutant gene, thus restoring normal gene function under the control of endogenous regulatory elements and reducing risks associated with random insertion into the genome. Gene-specific targeting has historically been limited to mouse embryonic stem cells. The development of zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) has permitted efficient genome editing in transformed and primary cells that were previously thought to be intractable to such genetic manipulation(1). In vitro, ZFNs have been shown to promote efficient genome editing via homology-directed repair by inducing a site-specific double-strand break (DSB) at a target locus(2-4), but it is unclear whether ZFNs can induce DSBs and stimulate genome editing at a clinically meaningful level in vivo. Here we show that ZFNs are able to induce DSBs efficiently when delivered directly to mouse liver and that, when co-delivered with an appropriately designed gene-targeting vector, they can stimulate gene replacement through both homology-directed and homology-independent targeted gene insertion at the ZFN-specified locus. The level of gene targeting achieved was sufficient to correct the prolonged clotting times in a mouse model of haemophilia B, and remained persistent after induced liver regeneration. Thus, ZFN-driven gene correction can be achieved in vivo, raising the possibility of genome editing as a viable strategy for the treatment of genetic disease.","[Li, Hojun; Haurigot, Virginia; Bhagwat, Anand S.; Anguela, Xavier M.; Sharma, Rajiv; Ivanciu, Lacramiora; Murphy, Samuel L.; Finn, Jonathan D.; Khazi, Fayaz R.; Zhou, Shangzhen; High, Katherine A.] Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, CTRB 5000, Div Hematol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Doyon, Yannick; Li, Tianjian; Wong, Sunnie Y.; Paschon, David E.; Rebar, Edward J.; Gregory, Philip D.; Holmes, Michael C.] Sangamo BioSci, Point Richmond Tech Ctr, Richmond, CA 94804 USA; [Malani, Nirav; Bushman, Frederic D.] Univ Penn, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [High, Katherine A.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","High, KA (reprint author), Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, CTRB 5000, Div Hematol, 3501 Civ Ctr Blvd, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",mholmes@sangamo.com; high@email.chop.edu,"Anguela, Xavier/D-3223-2013","Anguela, Xavier/0000-0003-2430-8598; Sharma, Rajiv/0000-0002-8147-5723; Haurigot, Virginia A./0000-0002-9772-2565; Doyon, Yannick/0000-0002-3889-9563; Bushman, Frederic/0000-0003-4740-4056",National Institutes of Health; Howard Hughes Medical Institute,This work was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.,,30,252,264,3,50,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Jul,2011,475,7355,,,,,217,U128,,10.1038/nature10177,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,791UA,WOS:000292690500048,21706032.0,No,,,11/20/17,katherine a.,high,na,na,na,na,na

At metastatic sites, a distinct population of metastasis-associated macrophages promotes the extravasation, seeding and persistent growth of tumour cells(2). Here we define the origin of these macrophages by showing that Gr1-positive inflammatory monocytes are preferentially recruited to pulmonary metastases but not to primary mammary tumours in mice. This process also occurs for human inflammatory monocytes in pulmonary metastases of human breast cancer cells. The recruitment of these inflammatory monocytes, which express CCR2 (the receptor for chemokine CCL2), as well as the subsequent recruitment of metastasis-associated macrophages and their interaction with metastasizing tumour cells, is dependent on CCL2 synthesized by both the tumour and the stroma. Inhibition of CCL2-CCR2 signalling blocks the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes, inhibits metastasis in vivo and prolongs the survival of tumour-bearing mice. Depletion of tumour-cell-derived CCL2 also inhibits metastatic seeding. Inflammatory monocytes promote the extravasation of tumour cells in a process that requires monocyte-derived vascular endothelial growth factor. CCL2 expression and macrophage infiltration are correlated with poor prognosis and metastatic disease in human breast cancer(3-6). Our data provide the mechanistic link between these two clinical associations and indicate new therapeutic targets for treating metastatic breast cancer.","[Qian, Bin-Zhi; Li, Jiufeng; Zhang, Hui; Kitamura, Takanori; Pollard, Jeffrey W.] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Ctr Study Reprod Biol & Womens Hlth, Dept Dev & Mol Biol, Bronx, NY 10461 USA; [Zhang, Jinghang] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Flow Cytometry Core Facil, Bronx, NY 10461 USA; [Campion, Liam R.; Kaiser, Elizabeth A.; Snyder, Linda A.] Ortho Biotech Oncol R&D, Radnor, PA 19087 USA","Pollard, JW (reprint author), Albert Einstein Coll Med, Ctr Study Reprod Biol & Womens Hlth, Dept Dev & Mol Biol, Bronx, NY 10461 USA.",pollard@aecom.yu.edu,,"Kitamura, Takanori/0000-0003-2032-3918","NIH [NIH PO1 CA100324, RO1 CA131270]; Albert Einstein Cancer Center Core [P30 CA 13330]","This work was supported by grants from the NIH to J.W.P.(NIH PO1 CA100324 and RO1 CA131270) and to the Albert Einstein Cancer Center Core (P30 CA 13330).

Emerging evidence suggests a link between angiogenesis and the tolerance of tumours to immune mechanisms(7-10). Hypoxia, a condition that is known to drive angiogenesis in tumours, results in the release of damage-associated pattern molecules, which can trigger the rejection of tumours by the immune system(11). Thus, the counter-activation of tolerance mechanisms at the site of tumour hypoxia would be a crucial condition for maintaining the immunological escape of tumours. However, a direct link between tumour hypoxia and tolerance through the recruitment of regulatory cells has not been established. We proposed that tumour hypoxia induces the expression of chemotactic factors that promote tolerance. Here we show that tumour hypoxia promotes the recruitment of regulatory T (T-reg) cells through induction of expression of the chemokine CC-chemokine ligand 28 (CCL28), which, in turn, promotes tumour tolerance and angiogenesis.

Adaptation to this stress phenotype is required for cancer cells to survive, and consequently cancer cells may become dependent upon non-oncogenes that do not ordinarily perform such a vital function in normal cells. Thus, targeting these non-oncogene dependencies in the context of a transformed genotype may result in a synthetic lethal interaction and the selective death of cancer cells(2). Here we used a cell-based small-molecule screening and quantitative proteomics approach that resulted in the unbiased identification of a small molecule that selectively kills cancer cells but not normal cells. Piperlongumine increases the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptotic cell death in both cancer cells and normal cells engineered to have a cancer genotype, irrespective of p53 status, but it has little effect on either rapidly or slowly dividing primary normal cells. Significant antitumour effects are observed in piperlongumine-treated mouse xenograft tumour models, with no apparent toxicity in normal mice. Moreover, piperlongumine potently inhibits the growth of spontaneously formed malignant breast tumours and their associated metastases in mice. Our results demonstrate the ability of a small molecule to induce apoptosis selectively in cells that have a cancer genotype, by targeting a non-oncogene co-dependency acquired through the expression of the cancer genotype in response to transformation-induced oxidative stress(3-5).","[Raj, Lakshmi; Ide, Takao; Gurkar, Aditi U.; Mandinova, Anna; Lee, Sam W.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Cutaneous Biol Res Ctr, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Raj, Lakshmi; Ide, Takao; Gurkar, Aditi U.; Mandinova, Anna; Lee, Sam W.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Foley, Michael; Schenone, Monica; Li, Xiaoyu; Tolliday, Nicola J.; Golub, Todd R.; Carr, Steven A.; Shamji, Alykhan F.; Stern, Andrew M.; Mandinova, Anna; Schreiber, Stuart L.; Lee, Sam W.] Broad Inst Harvard & MIT, Cambridge Ctr 7, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA","Lee, SW (reprint author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Cutaneous Biol Res Ctr, Bldg 149,13th St, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA.",amandinova@partners.org; stuart_schreiber@harvard.edu; swlee@partners.org,"Bell, Tiffany/F-4403-2010",,"NIH [CA142805, CA127247, CA085681, CA080058]; National Cancer Institute's Initiative for Chemical Genetics [N01-CO-12400]; Cancer Target Discovery and Development Network [5 RC2 CA148399-02]; National Institutes of Health [RL1HG004671, RL1CA133834, RL1GM084437, UL1RR024924]","We thank K.

In the absence of a better strategy, strong, globally resetting electrical shocks remain the only reliable treatment for cardiac fibrillation(5-7). Here we establish the relationship between the response of the tissue to an electric field and the spatial distribution of heterogeneities in the scale-free coronary vascular structure. We show that in response to a pulsed electric field, E, these heterogeneities serve as nucleation sites for the generation of intramural electrical waves with a source density rho(E) and a characteristic time, tau, for tissue depolarization that obeys the power law tau proportional to E(alpha). These intramural wave sources permit targeting of electrical turbulence near the cores of the vortices of electrical activity that drive complex fibrillatory dynamics. Weshow in vitro that simultaneous and direct access to multiple vortex cores results in rapid synchronization of cardiac tissue and therefore, efficient termination of fibrillation. Using this control strategy, we demonstrate low-energy termination of fibrillation in vivo. Our results give new insights into the mechanisms and dynamics underlying the control of spatio-temporal chaos in heterogeneous excitable media and provide new research perspectives towards alternative, life-saving low-energy defibrillation techniques.","[Luther, Stefan; Fenton, Flavio H.; Squires, Amgad; Bittihn, Philip; Hornung, Daniel; Cherry, Elizabeth M.; Luther, Gisa; Krinsky, Valentin I.; Bodenschatz, Eberhard] Max Planck Inst Dynam & Self Org, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Luther, Stefan; Fenton, Flavio H.; Cherry, Elizabeth M.; Gilmour, Robert F., Jr.] Cornell Univ, Dept Biomed Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Luther, Stefan; Bittihn, Philip; Hornung, Daniel; Luther, Gisa; Bodenschatz, Eberhard] Georg August Univ, Inst Nonlinear Dynam, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Luther, Stefan; Zabel, Markus; Hasenfuss, Gerd; Bodenschatz, Eberhard] Heart Res Ctr Gottingen HRCG, D-37075 Gottingen, Germany; [Kornreich, Bruce G.; Flanders, James; Gladuli, Andrea; Campoy, Luis] Cornell Univ, Dept Clin Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Squires, Amgad; Bodenschatz, Eberhard] Cornell Univ, Lab Atom & Solid State Phys, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Zabel, Markus; Hasenfuss, Gerd] Univ Med Ctr UMG, Dept Cardiol & Pneumol, D-37075 Gottingen, Germany; [Cherry, Elizabeth M.] Rochester Inst Technol, Sch Math Sci, Rochester, NY 14623 USA; [Krinsky, Valentin I.] Inst Nonlineaire Nice, F-06560 Valbonne, France; [Pumir, Alain] Univ Lyon 1, Lab Phys, Ecole Normale Super Lyon, F-69007 Lyon, France; [Pumir, Alain] CNRS, F-69007 Lyon, France; [Bodenschatz, Eberhard] Cornell Univ, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Luther, S (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Dynam & Self Org, Fassberg 17, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",stefan.luther@ds.mpg.de; flavio.h.fenton@cornell.edu,"Bittihn, Philip/E-2078-2011; Bodenschatz, Eberhard/C-6603-2009","Bodenschatz, Eberhard/0000-0002-2901-0144","National Science Foundation (NSF) [0800793, 0926190]; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [HL075515-S04, HL075515, HL073644]; IFCPAR Project [3404-4]; German Ministry for Education and Research [FKZ 01EZ0905/6]; Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics [NSFPHY05-51164]; Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (NSF TeraGrid); Pittsburgh NMR Center for Biomedical Research [NIH P41-EB001977]; European Community [HEALTH-F2-2009-241526]; Max Planck Society","We thank M.

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Mediator comprises 25 subunits with a total mass of more than one megadalton (refs 5, 6) and is organized into three modules, called head, middle/arm and tail(7-9). Our understanding of Mediator assembly and its role in regulating transcription has been impeded so far by limited structural information. Here we report the crystal structure of the essential Mediator head module (seven subunits, with a mass of 223 kilodaltons) at a resolution of 4.3 angstroms. Our structure reveals three distinct domains, with the integrity of the complex centred on a bundle of ten helices from five different head subunits. An intricate pattern of interactions within this helical bundle ensures the stable assembly of the head subunits and provides the binding sites for general transcription factors and Pol II. Our structural and functional data suggest that the head module juxtaposes transcription factor IIH and the carboxy-terminal domain of the largest subunit of Pol II, thereby facilitating phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal domain of Pol II.

During DNA replication, both heterochromatin and euchromatin are disrupted ahead of the replication fork and are then reassembled into their original epigenetic states behind the fork(3,4). How histone marks are accurately inherited from generation to generation is still poorly understood. In fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe), RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated histone methylation is cell cycle regulated. Centromeric repeats are transiently transcribed in the S phase of the cell cycle and are processed into short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) by the complexes RITS (RNA-induced initiation of transcriptional gene silencing) and RDRC (RNA-directed RNA polymerase complex)(5-7). The small RNAs together with silencing factors-including Dos1 (also known as Clr8 and Raf1), Dos2 (also known as Clr7 and Raf2), Rik1 and Lid2-promote heterochromatic methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9) by a histone methyltransferase, Clr4 (refs 8-13). The methylation of H3K9 provides a binding site for Swi6, a structural and functional homologue of metazoan heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1)(14). Here we characterize a silencing complex in fission yeast that contains Dos2, Rik1, Mms19 and Cdc20 (the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase-e). This complex regulates RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) activity in heterochromatin and is required for DNA replication and heterochromatin assembly. Our findings provide a molecular link between DNA replication and histone methylation, shedding light on how epigenetic marks are transmitted during each cell cycle.","[Li, Fei] NYU, Dept Biol, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Martienssen, Rob] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; [Cande, W.

Neurotransmission mediated by NMDA receptors is essential for basic brain development and function(5). These receptors form heteromeric ion channels and become activated after concurrent binding of glycine and glutamate to the GluN1 and GluN2 subunits, respectively. A functional hallmark of NMDA receptors is that their ion-channel activity is allosterically regulated by binding of small compounds to the amino-terminal domain (ATD) in a subtype-specific manner. Ifenprodil and related phenylethanolamine compounds, which specifically inhibit GluN1 and GluN2B NMDA receptors(6,7), have been intensely studied for their potential use in the treatment of various neurological disorders and diseases, including depression, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease(2,4). Despite considerable enthusiasm, mechanisms underlying the recognition of phenylethanolamines and ATD-mediated allosteric inhibition remain limited owing to a lack of structural information. Here we report that the GluN1 and GluN2B ATDs forma heterodimer and that phenylethanolamine binds at the interface between GluN1 and GluN2B, rather than within the GluN2B cleft. The crystal structure of the heterodimer formed between the GluN1b ATD from Xenopus laevis and the GluN2B ATD from Rattus norvegicus shows a highly distinct pattern of subunit arrangement that is different from the arrangements observed in homodimeric non-NMDA receptors and reveals the molecular determinants for phenylethanolamine binding. Restriction of domain movement in the bi-lobed structure of the GluN2B ATD, by engineering of an inter-subunit disulphide bond, markedly decreases sensitivity to ifenprodil, indicating that conformational freedom in the GluN2B ATD is essential for ifenprodil-mediated allosteric inhibition of NMDA receptors. These findings pave the way for improving the design of subtype-specific compounds with therapeutic value for neurological disorders and diseases.","[Karakas, Erkan; Simorowski, Noriko; Furukawa, Hiro] WM Keck Struct Biol Lab, Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA","Furukawa, H (reprint author), WM Keck Struct Biol Lab, Cold Spring Harbor Lab, 1 Bungtown Rd, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA.",furukawa@cshl.edu,,,NIH [MH085926]; Alzheimer's Association; Fox family; NARSAD,"We thank the staff at X25 and X29 at the National Synchrotron Light Source for beamline support.

Here we analyse the plate motions involved in two apparently disparate events-the unusually rapid motion of India between 67 and 52 million years ago and a contemporaneous, transitory slowing of Africa's motion-and show that the events are coupled, with the common element being the position of the Indian and African plates relative to the location of the Reunion plume head. The synchroneity of these events suggests that they were both driven by the force of the Reunion plume head. The recognition of this plume force has substantial tectonic implications: the speed-up and slowdown of India, the possible cessation of convergence between Africa and Eurasia in the Palaeocene epoch and the enigmatic bends of the fracture zones on the Southwest Indian Ridge can all be attributed to the Reunion plume.","[Cande, Steven C.; Stegman, Dave R.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Cande, SC (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",scande@ucsd.edu,"Stegman, Dave/F-5794-2010","Stegman, Dave/0000-0001-8012-6145",NSF [ANT-0944345],We thank J.

They are also by-products of several metabolic pathways and, without enzymatic catabolism, may accumulate and cause DNA damage. Ethanol, which is metabolished to acetaldehyde, is both carcinogenic and teratogenic in humans. Here we find that the Fanconi anaemia DNA repair pathway counteracts acetaldehyde-induced genotoxicity in mice. Our results show that the acetaldehyde-catabolising enzyme Aldh2 is essential for the development of Fancd2(-/-) embryos. Nevertheless, acetaldehyde-catabolism-competent mothers (Aldh2(+/-)) can support the development of double-mutant (Aldh2(-/-)Fancd2(-/-)) mice. However, these embryos are usually sensitive to ethanol exposure in utero, and ethanol consumption by postnatal double-deficient mice rapidly precipitates bone marrow failure. Lastly, Aldh2(-/-)Fancd2(-/-) mice spontaneously develop acute leukaemia. Acetaldehyde-mediated DNA damage may critically contribute to the genesis of fetal alcohol syndrome in fetuses, as well as to abnormal development, haematopoietic failure and cancer predisposition in Fanconi anaemia patients.","[Langevin, Frederic; Crossan, Gerry P.; Rosado, Ivan V.; Patel, Ketan J.] MRC Lab Mol Biol, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England; [Arends, Mark J.] Univ Cambridge, Addenbrookes Hosp, Dept Pathol, Cambridge CB2 2QQ, England; [Patel, Ketan J.] Univ Cambridge, Addenbrookes Hosp, Dept Med, Cambridge CB2 0QQ, England","Patel, KJ (reprint author), MRC Lab Mol Biol, Hills Rd, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England.",kjp@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk,,"Crossan, Gerry/0000-0002-7974-009X",Children's Leukaemia Trust; Fanconi Anaemia Research Fund,"We thank M.

Histamine H-1 receptor (H1R) antagonists are very effective drugs alleviating the symptoms of allergic reactions. Here we show the crystal structure of the H1R complex with. doxepin, a first-generation H1R antagonist. Doxepin sits deep in the ligand-binding pocket and directly interacts with Trp 428(6,48), a highly conserved key residue G -protein-coupled-receptor activation. This well-conserved pocket with mostly hydrophobic nature contributes to the low selectivity of the first-generation compounds. The pocket is associated with an anion-binding region occupied by a phosphate ion. Docking of various second-generation H1R antagonists reveals that the unique carboxyl group present in this class of compounds interacts with Lys191(5.39) and/or Lys 179(ECL2), both of which form part of the anion-binding region. This region is not conserved in other aminergic receptors, demonstrating how minor differences in receptors lead to pronounced selectivity differences with small molecules.

Huge storms known as Great White Spots, which are ten times larger than the regular storms, are rarer and occur about once per Saturnian year (29.5 Earth years). Current models propose that the outbreak of a Great White Spot is due to moist convection induced by water(5,6). However, the generation of the global disturbance and its effect on Saturn's permanent winds(1,7) have hitherto been unconstrained(8) by data, because there was insufficient spatial resolution and temporal sampling(9-11) to infer the dynamics of Saturn's weather layer (the layer in the troposphere where the cloud forms). Theoretically, it has been suggested that this phenomenon is seasonally controlled(5,9,10). Here we report observations of a storm at northern latitudes in the peak of a weak westward jet during the beginning of northern springtime, in accord with the seasonal cycle but earlier than expected. The storm head moved faster than the jet, was active during the two-month observation period, and triggered a planetary-scale disturbance that circled Saturn but did not significantly alter the ambient zonal winds. Numerical simulations of the phenomenon show that, as on Jupiter(12), Saturn's winds extend without decay deep down into the weather layer, at least to the water-cloud base at pressures of 10-12 bar, which is much deeper than solar radiation penetrates.","[Sanchez-Lavega, A.; del Rio-Gaztelurrutia, T.; Hueso, R.] Univ Basque Country, Escuela Tecn Super Ingn, Dept Fis Aplicada 1, Bilbao 48013, Spain; [Gomez-Forrellad, J.

These radio waves are the characteristic features of lightning from thunderstorms on Saturn, which last for days to months(2). Convective storms about 2,000 kilometres in size have been observed in recent years at planetocentric latitude 35 degrees south(3-5) (corresponding to a planetographic latitude of 41 degrees south). Here we report observations of a giant thunderstorm at planetocentric latitude 35 degrees north that reached a latitudinal extension of 10,000 kilometres-comparable in size to a 'Great White Spot'(6,7)-about three weeks after it started in early December 2010. The visible plume consists of high-altitude clouds that overshoot the outermost ammonia cloud layer owing to strong vertical convection, as is typical for thunderstorms. The flash rates of this storm are about an order of magnitude higher than previous ones, and peak rates larger than ten per second were recorded. This main storm developed an elongated eastward tail with additional but weaker storm cells that wrapped around the whole planet by February 2011. Unlike storms on Earth, the total power of this storm is comparable to Saturn's total emitted power. The appearance of such storms in the northern hemisphere could be related to the change of seasons(7), given that Saturn experienced vernal equinox in August 2009.","[Fischer, G.] Austrian Acad Sci, Space Res Inst, A-8042 Graz, Austria; [Kurth, W.

It has led to the generation of extreme-ultraviolet pulses(2) with a duration of less than 100 attoseconds (ref. 3; 1 as = 10(-18) s), to the measurement of intramolecular dynamics (by diffraction of an electron taken from the molecule under scrutiny(4,5)) and to ultrafast electron holography(6). All these effects have been observed with atoms or molecules in the gas phase. Electrons liberated from solids by few-cycle laser pulses are also predicted(7,8) to show a strong light-phase sensitivity, but only very small effects have been observed(14). Here we report that the spectra of electrons undergoing photoemission from a nanometre-scale tungsten tip show a dependence on the carrier-envelope phase of the laser, with a current modulation of up to 100 per cent. Depending on the carrier-envelope phase, electrons are emitted either from a single sub-500-attosecond interval of the 6-femtosecond laser pulse, or from two such intervals; the latter case leads to spectral interference. We also show that coherent elastic re-scattering of liberated electrons takes place at the metal surface. Owing to field enhancement at the tip, a simple laser oscillator reaches the peak electric field strengths required for attosecond experiments at 100-megahertz repetition rates, rendering complex amplified laser systems dispensable. Practically, this work represents a simple, extremely sensitive carrier-envelope phase sensor, which could be shrunk in volume to about one cubic centimetre. Our results indicate that the attosecond techniques developed with (and for) atoms and molecules can also be used with solids. In particular, we foresee subfemtosecond, subnanometre probing of collective electron dynamics (such as plasmon polaritons(9)) in solid-state systems ranging in scale from mesoscopic solids to clusters and to single protruding atoms.","[Krueger, Michael; Schenk, Markus; Hommelhoff, Peter] Max Planck Inst Quantum Opt, Ultrafast Quantum Opt Grp, D-85748 Garching, Germany","Hommelhoff, P (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Quantum Opt, Ultrafast Quantum Opt Grp, Hans Kopfermann Str 1, D-85748 Garching, Germany.",peter.hommelhoff@mpq.mpg.de,"Hommelhoff, Peter/C-5121-2013","Hommelhoff, Peter/0000-0003-4757-5410",European Union,"We thank M.

The control and re-use of heat are therefore important topics for existing and emerging technologies, including spintronics. Recently it was reported that heat flow within a ferromagnet can produce a flow of spin angular momentum-a spin current-and an associated voltage(1). This spin Seebeck effect has been observed in metallic(1,2), insulating(3) and semiconductor ferromagnets(4) with temperature gradients across them. Here we describe and report the demonstration of Seebeck spin tunnelling-a distinctly different thermal spin flow, of purely interfacial nature-generated in a tunnel contact between electrodes of different temperatures when at least one of the electrodes is a ferromagnet. The Seebeck spin current is governed by the energy derivative of the tunnel spin polarization. By exploiting this in ferromagnet-oxide-silicon tunnel junctions, we observe thermal transfer of spins from the ferromagnet to the silicon without a net tunnel charge current. The induced spin accumulation scales linearly with heating power and changes sign when the temperature differential is reversed. This thermal spin current can be used by itself, or in combination with electrical spin injection, to increase device efficiency. The results highlight the engineering of heat transport in spintronic devices and facilitate the functional use of heat.","[Sharma, Sandeep; Saito, Hidekazu; Yuasa, Shinji; Jansen, Ron] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Spintron Res Ctr, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058568, Japan; [Le Breton, Jean-Christophe; Sharma, Sandeep] Netherlands Fdn Fundamental Res Matter FOM, NL-3502 GA Utrecht, Netherlands; [Sharma, Sandeep] Univ Groningen, Zernike Inst Adv Mat, NL-9747 AG Groningen, Netherlands","Jansen, R (reprint author), Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Spintron Res Ctr, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058568, Japan.",ron.jansen@aist.go.jp,"Yuasa, Shinji/H-2804-2016","Yuasa, Shinji/0000-0003-1093-9057; Sharma, Sandeep/0000-0001-5475-1297",Netherlands Foundation for Fundamental Research on Matter (FOM),"We are grateful to S.

Overexploitation and climate variability impact the abundance and distribution of top predators in ocean ecosystems(1-4). Improved understanding of ecological patterns, evolutionary constraints and ecosystem function is critical for preventing extinctions, loss of biodiversity and disruption of ecosystem services. Recent advances in electronic tagging techniques have provided the capacity to observe the movements and long-distance migrations of animals in relation to ocean processes across a range of ecological scales(5,6). Tagging of Pacific Predators, a field programme of the Census of Marine Life, deployed 4,306 tags on 23 species in the North Pacific Ocean, resulting in a tracking data set of unprecedented scale and species diversity that covers 265,386 tracking days from 2000 to 2009. Here we report migration pathways, link ocean features to multispecies hotspots and illustrate niche partitioning within and among congener guilds. Our results indicate that the California Current large marine ecosystem and the North Pacific transition zone attract and retain a diverse assemblage of marine vertebrates. Within the California Current large marine ecosystem, several predator guilds seasonally undertake north-south migrations that may be driven by oceanic processes, species-specific thermal tolerances and shifts in prey distributions. We identify critical habitats across multinational boundaries and show that top predators exploit their environment in predictable ways, providing the foundation for spatial management of large marine ecosystems.","[Block, B.

Depressed patients report the alleviation of major depressive disorder symptoms within two hours of a single, low-dose intravenous infusion of ketamine, with effects lasting up to two weeks(1-3), unlike traditional antidepressants (serotonin re-uptake inhibitors), which take weeks to reach efficacy. This delay is a major drawback to current therapies for major depressive disorder and faster-acting antidepressants are needed, particularly for suicide-risk patients'. The ability of ketamine to produce rapidly acting, long-lasting antidepressant responses in depressed patients provides a unique opportunity to investigate underlying cellular mechanisms. Here we show that ketamine and other NMDAR antagonists produce fast-acting behavioural antidepressant-like effects in mouse models, and that these effects depend on the rapid synthesis of brain-derived neurotrophic factor. We find that the ketamine-mediated blockade of NMDAR at rest deactivates eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) kinase (also called CaMKIII), resulting in reduced eEF2 phosphorylation and de-suppression of translation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Furthermore, we find that inhibitors of eEF2 kinase induce fast-acting behavioural antidepressant-like effects. Our findings indicate that the regulation of protein synthesis by spontaneous neurotransmission may serve as a viable therapeutic target for the development of fast-acting antidepressants.","[Autry, Anita E.; Adachi, Megunai; Na, Elisa S.; Los, Maarten F.; Cheng, Peng-fei; Monteggia, Lisa M.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Psychiat, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Nosyreva, Elena; Kavalali, Ege T.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Neurosci, Dallas, TX 75390 USA","Kavalali, ET (reprint author), Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Psychiat, 5323 Harry Hines Blvd, Dallas, TX 75390 USA.",ege.kavalali@utsouthwestern.edu,"Adachi, Megumi/M-7746-2017","Adachi, Megumi/0000-0003-3404-6640",UT Southwestern Medical Center;  [MH070727];  [MH066198];  [T32 MH 76690-02],"We thank M.

These fibrils are associated with numerous pathologies(1) as well as with normal cellular functions(2,3), and frequently form during protein denaturation(4,5). Inhibitors of pathological amyloid fibril formation could be useful in the development of therapeutics, provided that the inhibitors were specific enough to avoid interfering with normal processes. Here we show that computer-aided, structure-based design can yield highly specific peptide inhibitors of amyloid formation. Using known atomic structures of segments of amyloid fibrils as templates, we have designed and characterized an all-D-amino-acid inhibitor of the fibril formation of the tau protein associated with Alzheimer's disease, and a non-natural L.-amino-acid inhibitor of an amyloid fibril that enhances sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus. Our results indicate that peptides from structure-based designs can disrupt the fibril formation of full-length proteins, including those, such as tau protein, that lack fully ordered native structures. Because the inhibiting peptides have been designed on structures of dual-beta-sheet 'steric zippers', the successful inhibition of amyloid fibril formation strengthens the hypothesis that amyloid spines contain steric zippers.","[Sievers, Stuart A.; Chang, Howard W.; Zhao, Anni; Jiang, Lin; Eisenberg, David] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biol Chem, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Sievers, Stuart A.; Chang, Howard W.; Zhao, Anni; Jiang, Lin; Eisenberg, David] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Chem & Biochem, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Karanicolas, John; Baker, David] Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Karanicolas, John; Baker, David] Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Karanicolas, John; Stevens, Jason T.] Univ Kansas, Ctr Bioinformat, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Karanicolas, John; Stevens, Jason T.] Univ Kansas, Dept Mol Biosci, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Zirafi, Onofrio; Muench, Jan] Univ Hosp Ulm, Inst Mol Virol, D-89081 Ulm, Germany","Eisenberg, D (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biol Chem, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",david@mbi.ucla.edu,"Eisenberg, David/E-2447-2011; Jiang, Lin/G-1575-2010; Baker, David/K-8941-2012","Baker, David/0000-0001-7896-6217","Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation; Ruth L.

Two major molecular subtypes can be distinguished, characterized respectively by a high or low number of somatic hypermutations in the variable region of immunoglobulin genes(3,4). The molecular changes leading to the pathogenesis of the disease are still poorly understood. Here we performed whole-genome sequencing of four cases of CLL and identified 46 somatic mutations that potentially affect gene function. Further analysis of these mutations in 363 patients with CLL identified four genes that are recurrently mutated: notch 1 (NOTCH1), exportin 1 (XPO1), myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MYD88) and kelch-like 6 (KLHL6). Mutations in MYD88 and KLHL6 are predominant in cases of CLL with mutated immunoglobulin genes, whereas NOTCH1 and XPO1 mutations are mainly detected in patients with unmutated immunoglobulins. The patterns of somatic mutation, supported by functional and clinical analyses, strongly indicate that the recurrent NOTCH1, MYD88 and XPO1 mutations are oncogenic changes that contribute to the clinical evolution of the disease. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive analysis of CLL combining whole-genome sequencing with clinical characteristics and clinical outcomes. It highlights the usefulness of this approach for the identification of clinically relevant mutations in cancer.","[Conde, Laura; Villamor, Neus; Jares, Pedro; Bea, Silvia; Lopez-Guerra, Monica; Colomer, Dolors; Lopez, Cristina; Navarro, Alba; Aymerich, Marta; Rozman, Maria; Costa, Dolors; Carrio, Anna; Guijarro, Sara; Enjuanes, Anna; Hernandez, Lluis; Campo, Elias] Univ Barcelona, IDIBAPS, Hosp Clin, Serv Anat Patol,Unidad Hematopatol, E-08036 Barcelona, Spain; [Puente, Xose S.; Quesada, Victor; Ordonez, Gonzalo R.; Puente, Diana A.; Freije, Jose M.

Normally, ROS levels are tightly controlled by an inducible antioxidant program that responds to cellular stressors and is predominantly regulated by the transcription factor Nrf2 (also known as Nfe212) and its repressor protein Keap1 (refs 2-5). In contrast to the acute physiological regulation of Nrf2, in neoplasia there is evidence for increased basal activation of Nrf2. Indeed, somatic mutations that disrupt the Nrf2-Keap1 interaction to stabilize Nrf2 and increase the constitutive transcription of Nrf2 target genes were recently identified, indicating that enhanced ROS detoxification and additional Nrf2 functions may in fact be pro-tumorigenic(6). Here, we investigated ROS metabolism in primary murine cells following the expression of endogenous oncogenic alleles of Kras, Braf and Myc, and found that ROS are actively suppressed by these oncogenes. K-Ras(G12D), B-Raf(V619E) and Myc(ERT2) each increased the transcription of Nrf2 to stably elevate the basal Nrf2, antioxidant program and thereby lower intracellular ROS and confer a more reduced intracellular environment. Oncogene-directed increased expression of Nrf2 is a new mechanism for the activation of the Nrf2 antioxidant program, and is evident in primary cells and tissues of mice expressing K-Ras(G12D) up and B-Raf(V619E), and in human pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, genetic targeting of the Nrf2 pathway impairs K-Ras(G12D)-induced proliferation and tumorigenesis in vivo. Thus, the Nrf2 antioxidant and cellular detoxification program represents a previously unappreciated mediator of oncogenesis.","[De Nicola, Gina M.; Karreth, Florian A.; Humpton, Timothy J.; Gopinathan, Aarthi; Frese, Kristopher; Tuveson, David A.] Cancer Res UK Cambridge Inst, Li Ka Shing Ctr, Cambridge CB2 0RE, England; [De Nicola, Gina M.; Gopinathan, Aarthi] Univ Penn, Abramson Family Canc Res Inst, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Karreth, Florian A.] Univ Vienna, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Wei, Cong; Mangal, Dipti; Yu, Kenneth H.; Blair, Ian A.] Univ Penn, Ctr Canc Pharmacol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Yeo, Charles J.] Thomas Jefferson Univ, Jefferson Med Coll, Dept Surg, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA; [Calhoun, Eric S.] Alma Coll, Dept Biol, Alma, MI 48801 USA; [Scrimieri, Francesca; Hruban, Ralph H.; Iacobuzio-Donahue, Christine; Kern, Scott E.] Johns Hopkins Med Inst, Sol Goldman Pancreat Canc Res Ctr, Dept Oncol, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA; [Winter, Jordan M.] Johns Hopkins Med Inst, Sol Goldman Pancreat Canc Res Ctr, Dept Surg, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA; [Hruban, Ralph H.; Iacobuzio-Donahue, Christine; Kern, Scott E.] Johns Hopkins Med Inst, Sol Goldman Pancreat Canc Res Ctr, Dept Pathol, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA","Tuveson, DA (reprint author), Cancer Res UK Cambridge Inst, Li Ka Shing Ctr, Robinson Way, Cambridge CB2 0RE, England.",david.tuveson@cancer.org.uk,"Bell, Tiffany/F-4403-2010","Humpton, Timothy/0000-0002-8030-9539; DeNicola, Gina/0000-0001-6611-6696","University of Cambridge; Cancer Research UK; The Li Ka Shing Foundation; Hutchison Whampoa Limited; NIHR Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre; NIH [CA101973, CA111294, CA084291, CA105490, CA62924, CA128920, CA106610]; Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania [IRG 78-002-26]; Emerald Foundation; Marjorie Kovler Fund; Ruth L.

It is administered at high doses (1-2 grams per kilogram) for the suppression of autoantibody-triggered inflammation in a variety of clinical settings'. This anti-inflammatory activity of intravenous immunoglobulin is triggered by a minor population of IgG crystallizable fragments (Fcs), with glycans terminating in alpha 2,6 sialic acids (sFc) that target myeloid regulatory cells expressing the lectin dendritic-cell-specific ICAM-3 grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN; also known as CD209)(2-4). Here, to characterize this response in detail, we generated humanized DC-SIGN mice (hDC-SIGN), and demonstrate that the anti-inflammatory activity of intravenous immunoglobulin can be recapitulated by the transfer of bone-marrow-derived sFc-treated hDC-SIGN(+) macrophages or dendritic cells into naive recipients. Furthermore, sFc administration results in the production of IL-33, which, in turn, induces expansion of IL-4-producing basophils that promote increased expression of the inhibitory Fc receptor Fc gamma RIIB on effector macrophages. Systemic administration of the T(H)2 cytokines IL-33 or IL-4 upregulates Fc gamma RIIB on macrophages, and suppresses serum-induced arthritis. Consistent with these results, transfer of IL-33-treated basophils suppressed induced arthritic inflammation. This novel DC-SIGN-T(H)2 pathway initiated by an endogenous ligand, sFc, provides an intrinsic mechanism for maintaining immune homeostasis that could be manipulated to provide therapeutic benefit in autoimmune diseases.","[Anthony, Robert M.; Kobayashi, Toshihiko; Wermeling, Fredrik; Ravetch, Jeffrey V.] Rockefeller Univ, Lab Mol Genet & Immunol, New York, NY 10065 USA","Ravetch, JV (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Lab Mol Genet & Immunol, 1230 York Ave, New York, NY 10065 USA.",ravetch@rockefeller.edu,,"Wermeling, Fredrik/0000-0001-9633-677X","Wenner-Gren Foundations, Sweden; Virdante Pharmaceuticals; NIH","The authors thank P.

CEREVISIAE; METHYLATION; POLYMERASE; CHROMATIN; DECAY; XRN1,"Non-coding (nc)RNAs are key players in numerous biological processes such as gene regulation, chromatin domain formation and genome stability(1,2). Large ncRNAs interact with histone modifiers' and are involved in cancer development(6), X-chromosome inactivation(7) and autosomal gene imprinting(8). However, despite recent evidence showing that pervasive transcription is more widespread than previously thought(9), only a few examples mediating gene regulation in eukaryotes have been described(10). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the bona-fide regulatory ncRNAs are destabilized by the Xrn1 5'-3' RNA exonudease(11,12) (also known as Kem1), but the genome-wide characterization of the entire regulatory ncRNA family remains elusive. Here, using strand-specific RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we identify a novel class of 1,658 Xrn1-sensitive unstable transcripts (XUTs) in which 66% are antisense to open reading frames. These transcripts are polyadenylated and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)-dependent. The majority of XUTs strongly accumulate in lithium-containing media, indicating that they might have a role in adaptive responses to changes in growth conditions. Notably, RNAP II chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis of Xrn1-deficient strains revealed a significant decrease of RNAPII occupancy over 273 genes with antisense XUTs. These genes show an unusual bias for H3K4me3 marks and require the Set1 histone H3 lysine 4 methyl-transferase for silencing. Furthermore, abolishing H3K4me3 triggers the silencing of other genes with antisense XUTs, supporting a model in which H3K4me3 antagonizes antisense ncRNA repressive activity. Our results demonstrate that antisense ncRNA-mediated regulation is a general regulatory pathway for gene expression in S. cerevisiae.","[van Dijk, E. L.; Chen, C.

Folded structures in the coding region of an mRNA represent a kinetic barrier that lowers the peptide elongation rate, as the ribosome must disrupt structures it encounters in the mRNA at its entry site to allow translocation to the next codon. Such structures are exploited by the cell to create diverse strategies for translation regulation, such as programmed frameshifting(1,2), the modulation of protein expression levels-(3,4), ribosome localization(5) and co-translational protein folding(6). Although strand separation activity is inherent to the ribosome, requiring no exogenous helicases(7), its mechanism is still unknown. Here, using a single-molecule optical tweezers assay on mRNA hairpins, we find that the translation rate of identical codons at the decoding centre is greatly influenced by the GC content of folded structures at the mRNA entry site. Furthermore, force applied to the ends of the hairpin to favour its unfolding significantly speeds translation. Quantitative analysis of the force dependence of its helicase activity reveals that the ribosome, unlike previously studied helicases, uses two distinct active mechanisms to unwind mRNA structure: it destabilizes the helical junction at the mRNA entry site by biasing its thermal fluctuations towards the open state, increasing the probability of the ribosome translocating unhindered; and it mechanically pulls apart the mRNA single strands of the closed junction during the conformational changes that accompany ribosome translocation. The second of these mechanisms ensures a minimal basal rate of translation in the cell; specialized, mechanically stable structures are required to stall the ribosome temporarily(1,2). Our results establish a quantitative mechanical basis for understanding the mechanism of regulation of the elongation rate of translation by structured mRNAs.","[Qu, Xiaohui; Wen, Jin-Der; Bustamante, Carlos; Tinoco, Ignacio, Jr.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Qu, Xiaohui; Wen, Jin-Der; Bustamante, Carlos] Univ Calif Berkeley, Jason L Choy Lab Single Mol Biophys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Qu, Xiaohui; Wen, Jin-Der; Bustamante, Carlos] Univ Calif Berkeley, QB3 Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Lancaster, Laura; Noller, Harry F.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Mol Cell & Dev Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Lancaster, Laura; Noller, Harry F.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ctr Mol Biol RNA, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Bustamante, Carlos] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Bustamante, Carlos] Univ Calif Berkeley, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Tinoco, I (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",carlos@alice.berkeley.edu; intinoco@lbl.gov,,"Wen, Jin-Der/0000-0001-8317-4329; Bustamante, Carlos/0000-0002-2970-0073",National Institutes of Health; Human Frontiers Science Program,"We thank rnembers of the Tinoco and Bustamante labs for helpful discussions, especially S.

The evolution of naked cuticle on larvae of Drosophila sechellia resulted from changes in five transcriptional enhancers of shavenbaby (svb), a transcript of the ovo locus that encodes a transcription factor that governs morphogenesis of microtrichiae, hereafter called 'trichomes'. Here we show that the function of one of these enhancers evolved through multiple single-nucleotide substitutions that altered both the timing and level of svb expression. The consequences of these nucleotide substitutions on larval morphology were quantified with a novel functional assay. We found that each substitution had a relatively small phenotypic effect, and that many nucleotide changes account for this large morphological difference. In addition, we observed that the substitutions had non-additive effects. These data provide unprecedented resolution of the phenotypic effects of substitutions and show how individual nucleotide changes in a transcriptional enhancer have caused morphological evolution.","[Frankel, Nicolas; Erezyilmaz, Deniz F.; Wang, Shu; Stern, David L.] Princeton Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Frankel, Nicolas; Erezyilmaz, Deniz F.; Wang, Shu; Stern, David L.] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [McGregor, Alistair P.] Vet Med Univ Wien, Inst Populat Genet, A-1210 Vienna, Austria; [Payre, Francois] Univ Toulouse, F-31062 Toulouse, France; [Payre, Francois] Ctr Dev Biol, Ctr Natl Rech Sci, UMR5547, F-31062 Toulouse, France","Stern, DL (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",dstern@princeton.edu,"Phelps, Steve/H-2263-2011","McGregor, Alistair/0000-0002-2908-2420; PAYRE, Francois/0000-0002-8144-6711; Stern, David/0000-0002-1847-6483",Pew Charitable Trusts; Ruth L.

How hosts and viruses coexist in nature remains unclear, although the presence of both susceptible and resistant cells may allow this coexistence. Combined whole-genome sequencing and PCR screening technology now enables us to investigate the effect of resistance on genome evolution and the genomic mechanisms behind the long-term coexistence of Prochlorococcus and their viruses. Here we present a genome analysis of 77 substrains selected for resistance to ten viruses, revealing mutations primarily in non-conserved, horizontally transferred genes that localize to a single hypervariable genomic island. Mutations affected viral attachment to the cell surface and imposed a fitness cost to the host, manifested by significantly lower growth rates or a previously unknown mechanism of more rapid infection by other viruses. The mutant genes are generally uncommon in nature yet some carry polymorphisms matching those found experimentally. These data are empirical evidence indicating that viral-attachment genes are preferentially located in genomic islands and that viruses are a selective pressure enhancing the diversity of both island genes and island gene content. This diversity emerges as a genomic mechanism that reduces the effective host population size for infection by a given virus, thus facilitating long-term coexistence between viruses and their hosts in nature.","[Avrani, Sarit; Sharon, Itai; Lindell, Debbie] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Biol, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel; [Wurtzel, Omri; Sorek, Rotem] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Mol Genet, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel","Lindell, D (reprint author), Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Biol, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel.",dlindell@tx.technion.ac.il,,"Sharon, Itai/0000-0003-0705-2316",European Commission ERC [203406]; ISF [1504/06]; Technion Russell Berrie Nanotechnology Institute; ISF-FIRST [1615/09]; ERC; Azrieli fellowship,"We thank E.

The Cancer Genome Atlas project has analysed messenger RNA expression, microRNA expression, promoter methylation and DNA copy number in 489 high-grade serous ovarian adenocarcinomas and the DNA sequences of exons from coding genes in 316 of these tumours. Here we report that high-grade serous ovarian cancer is characterized by TP53 mutations in almost all tumours (96%); low prevalence but statistically recurrent somatic mutations in nine further genes including NF1, BRCA1, BRCA2, RB1 and CDK12; 113 significant focal DNA copy number aberrations; and promoter methylation events involving 168 genes. Analyses delineated four ovarian cancer transcriptional subtypes, three microRNA subtypes, four promoter methylation subtypes and a transcriptional signature associated with survival duration, and shed new light on the impact that tumours with BRCA1/2 (BRCA1 or BRCA2) and CCNE1 aberrations have on survival. Pathway analyses suggested that homologous recombination is defective in about half of the tumours analysed, and that NOTCH and FOXM1 signalling are involved in serous ovarian cancer pathophysiology.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Div Life Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Bell, D.] Mayo Clin, Div Anat Pathol, Rochester, MN 55905 USA; [Berchuck, A.] Duke Univ, Div Gynecol Oncol, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Med Ctr, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Berchuck, A.] Duke Univ, Duke Inst Genome Sci & Policy, Med Ctr, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Birrer, M.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Birrer, M.; Imielinski, M.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Chien, J.] Mayo Clin, Div Expt Pathol, Rochester, MN 55905 USA; [Cramer, D.

It has been difficult to probe to higher redshifts, however, because quasars have historically been identified(2-4) in optical surveys, which are insensitive to sources at redshifts exceeding 6.5. Here we report observations of a quasar (ULASJ112001.48+064124.3) at a redshift of 7.085, which is 0.77 billion years after the Big Bang. ULASJ1120+0641 has a luminosity of 6.3 x 10(13)L(circle dot) and hosts a black hole with a mass of 2 x 10(9)M(circle dot) (where L(circle dot) and M(circle dot) are the luminosity and mass of the Sun). The measured radius of the ionized near zone around ULASJ1120+0641 is 1.9 megaparsecs, a factor of three smaller than is typical for quasars at redshifts between 6.0 and 6.4. The near-zone transmission profile is consistent with a Ly alpha d damping wing(5), suggesting that the neutral fraction of the intergalactic medium in front of ULASJ1120+0641 exceeded 0.1.","[Mortlock, Daniel J.; Warren, Stephen J.; Patel, Mitesh] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Blackett Lab, Astrophys Grp, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Venemans, Bram P.] European So Observ, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Hewett, Paul C.; McMahon, Richard G.; Gonzales-Solares, Eduardo A.; Irwin, Mike J.] Univ Cambridge, Inst Astron, Cambridge CB3 0HA, England; [Simpson, Chris] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Astrophys Res Inst, Birkenhead CH41 1LD, Merseyside, England; [Theuns, Tom] Univ Durham, Inst Computat Cosmol, Dept Phys, Durham DH1 3LE, England; [Theuns, Tom] Univ Antwerp, B-2020 Antwerp, Belgium; [Adamson, Andy] Joint Astron Ctr, Hilo, HI 96720 USA; [Dye, Simon] Univ Nottingham, Sch Phys & Astron, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Hambly, Nigel C.; Lawrence, Andy] Univ Edinburgh, SUPA, Inst Astron, Royal Observ, Edinburgh EH9 3HJ, Midlothian, Scotland; [Hirst, Paul] Gemini Observ, Hilo, HI 96720 USA; [Kuiper, Ernst; Rottgering, Huub J.

Previous compositional analyses of particles injected by the plume into Saturn's diffuse E ring have already indicated the presence of liquid water(8), but the mechanisms driving the plume emission are still debated(13). Here we report an analysis of the composition of freshly ejected particles close to the sources. Salt-rich ice particles are found to dominate the total mass flux of ejected solids (more than 99 per cent) but they are depleted in the population escaping into Saturn's E ring.

However, the light field emitted by a single atom can exhibit much richer dynamics. A prominent example(2,3) is the predicted ability of a single atom to produce quadrature-squeezed light(4), which has fluctuations of amplitude or phase that are below the shot-noise level. However, such squeezing is much more difficult to observe than the emission of single photons(5). Squeezed beams have been generated using macroscopic and mesoscopic media down to a few tens of atoms(6), but despite experimental efforts(7-9), single-atom squeezing has so far escaped observation. Here we generate squeezed light with a single atom in a high-finesse optical resonator. The strong coupling of the atom to the cavity field induces a genuine quantum mechanical nonlinearity(10), which is several orders of magnitude larger than in typical macroscopic media(11-13). This produces observable quadrature squeezing(14-16), with an excitation beam containing on average only two photons per system lifetime. In sharp contrast to the emission of single photons(17), the squeezed light stems from the quantum coherence of photon pairs emitted from the system(18). The ability of a single atom to induce strong coherent interactions between propagating photons opens up new perspectives for photonic quantum logic with single emitters(19-24).","[Ourjoumtsev, A.; Kubanek, A.; Koch, M.; Sames, C.; Pinkse, P.

Electronic transport measurements on single artificial atoms, or quantum dots, have made it possible to study the effect in great detail(3-5). Here we report optical measurements on a single semiconductor quantum dot tunnel-coupled to a degenerate electron gas which show that absorption of a single photon leads to an abrupt change in the system Hamiltonian and a quantum quench of Kondo correlations. By inferring the characteristic power-law exponents from the experimental absorption line shapes, we find a unique signature of the quench in the form of an Anderson orthogonality catastrophe(6,7), induced by a vanishing overlap between the initial and final many-body wavefunctions. We show that the power-law exponent that determines the degree of orthogonality can be tuned using an external magnetic field(8), which unequivocally demonstrates that the observed absorption line shape originates from Kondo correlations. Our experiments demonstrate that optical measurements on single artificial atoms offer new perspectives on many-body phenomena previously studied using transport spectroscopy only.","[Hanl, M.; Weichselbaum, A.; von Delft, J.] Univ Munich, Arnold Sommerfeld Ctr Theoret Phys, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Latta, C.; Haupt, F.; Claassen, M.; Wuester, W.; Fallahi, P.; Faelt, S.; Tuereci, H.

The fossil record has, until now, been inadequate in providing insight into the early evolution of eyes during the initial radiation of many animal groups known as the Cambrian explosion. This is surprising because Cambrian Burgess-Shale-type deposits are replete with exquisitely preserved animals, especially arthropods, that possess eyes(3-5). However, with the exception of biomineralized trilobite eyes, virtually nothing is known about the details of their optical design. Here we report exceptionally preserved fossil eyes from the Early Cambrian (similar to 515 million years ago) Emu Bay Shale of South Australia, revealing that some of the earliest arthropods possessed highly advanced compound eyes, each with over 3,000 large ommatidial lenses and a specialized 'bright zone'. These are the oldest non-biomineralized eyes known in such detail, with preservation quality exceeding that found in the Burgess Shale and Chengjiang deposits. Non-biomineralized eyes of similar complexity are otherwise unknown until about 85 million years later(6,7). The arrangement and size of the lenses indicate that these eyes belonged to an active predator that was capable of seeing in low light. The eyes are more complex than those known from contemporaneous trilobites and are as advanced as those of many living forms. They provide further evidence that the Cambrian explosion involved rapid innovation in fine-scale anatomy as well as gross morphology, and are consistent with the concept that the development of advanced vision helped to drive this great evolutionary event(8).","[Lee, Michael S.

Modern lineage labelling studies(1-3) have shown that in the sea urchin embryo model system, descendants of the veg1 and veg2 cell lineages produce the endoderm, and that the veg2 lineage also gives rise to mesodermal cell types. It is known that Wnt/beta-catenin signalling is required for endoderm specification(4-6) and Delta/Notch signalling is required for mesoderm specification(7-9). Some directcis-regulatory targets of these signals have been found(10,11) and various phenomenological patterns of gene expression have been observed in the pre-gastrular endomesoderm. However, no comprehensive, causal explanation of endoderm specification has been conceived for sea urchins, nor for any other deuterostome. Here we propose a model, on the basis of the underlying genomic control system, that provides such an explanation, built at several levels of biological organization. The hardwired core of the control system consists of the cis-regulatory apparatus of endodermal regulatory genes, which determine the relationship between the inputs to which these genes are exposed and their outputs. The architecture of the network circuitry controlling the dynamic process of endoderm specification then explains, at the system level, a sequence of developmental logic operations, which generate the biological process. The control system initiates non-interacting endodermal and mesodermal gene regulatory networks in veg2-derived cells and extinguishes the endodermal gene regulatory network in mesodermal precursors. It also generates a cross-regulatory network that specifies future anterior endoderm in veg2 descendants and institutes a distinct network specifying posterior endoderm in veg1-derived cells. The network model provides an explanatory framework that relates endoderm specification to the genomic regulatory code.","[Peter, Isabelle S.; Davidson, Eric H.] CALTECH, Div Biol, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Davidson, EH (reprint author), CALTECH, Div Biol, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",ipeter@caltech.edu; davidson@caltech.edu,,,Swiss National Science Foundation; National Institutes of Health [HD37105],"We acknowledge technical assistance from J.

A therapeutic ideal-relative to cell transplantation-would be to stimulate a resident source, thus avoiding the caveats of limited graft survival, restricted homing to the site of injury and host immune rejection. Here we demonstrate in mice that the adult heart contains a resident stem or progenitor cell population, which has the potential to contribute bona fide terminally differentiated cardiomyocytes after myocardial infarction. We reveal a novel genetic label of the activated adult progenitors via re-expression of a key embryonic epicardial gene, Wilm's tumour 1 (Wt1), through priming by thymosin beta 4, a peptide previously shown to restore vascular potential to adult epicardium-derived progenitor cells(2) with injury. Cumulative evidence indicates an epicardial origin of the progenitor population, and embryonic reprogramming results in the mobilization of this population and concomitant differentiation to give rise to de novo cardiomyocytes. Cell transplantation confirmed a progenitor source and chromosome painting of labelled donor cells revealed transdifferentiation to a myocyte fate in the absence of cell fusion. Derived cardiomyocytes are shown here to structurally and functionally integrate with resident muscle; as such, stimulation of this adult progenitor pool represents a significant step towards resident-cell-based therapy in human ischaemic heart disease.","[Smart, Nicola; Bollini, Sveva; Dube, Karina N.; Vieira, Joaquim M.; Riley, Paul R.] UCL Inst Child Hlth, Mol Med Unit, London WC1N 1EH, England; [Zhou, Bin; Pu, William T.] Childrens Hosp, Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Zhou, Bin; Pu, William T.] Childrens Hosp, Dept Cardiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Zhou, Bin; Pu, William T.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Zhou, Bin] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Biol Sci, Inst Nutr Sci, Beijing 20031, Peoples R China; [Davidson, Sean; Yellon, Derek] UCL, Hatter Cardiovasc Inst, London WC1E 6HX, England; [Riegler, Johannes; Lythgoe, Mark F.] UCL, Dept Med, Ctr Adv Biomed Imaging CABI, London WC1E 6DD, England; [Riegler, Johannes; Lythgoe, Mark F.] UCL, Inst Child Hlth, London WC1E 6DD, England; [Riegler, Johannes] UCL, Ctr Math & Phys Life Sci & Expt Biol CoMPLEX, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Price, Anthony N.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, MRC, Ctr Clin Sci, Fac Med, London W12 0NN, England","Riley, PR (reprint author), UCL Inst Child Hlth, Mol Med Unit, London WC1N 1EH, England.",p.riley@ich.ucl.ac.uk,"Davidson, Sean/F-5275-2010; Bollini, Sveva/J-6004-2016","Davidson, Sean/0000-0001-5182-4980; Bollini, Sveva/0000-0003-1076-0823; Vieira, Joaquim/0000-0003-2023-6304; Zhou, Bin/0000-0001-5278-5522",British Heart Foundation,"This work was funded by the British Heart Foundation.

The first heart field differentiates earlier in lateral plate mesoderm, generates the linear heart tube and ultimately gives rise to the left ventricle. The second heart field (SHF) differentiates later in pharyngeal mesoderm, elongates the heart tube, and gives rise to the outflow tract and much of the right ventricle. Because hearts in lower vertebrates contain a rudimentary outflow tract but not a right ventricle(4), the existence and function of SHF-like cells in these species has remained a topic of speculation(4-10). Here we provide direct evidence from Cre/Lox-mediated lineage tracing and loss-of-function studies in zebrafish, a lower vertebrate with a single ventricle, that latent TGF-beta binding protein 3 (ltbp3) transcripts mark a field of cardiac progenitor cells with defining characteristics of the anterior SHF in mammals. Specifically, ltbp3(+) cells differentiate in pharyngeal mesoderm after formation of the heart tube, elongate the heart tube at the outflow pole, and give rise to three cardiovascular lineages in the outflow tract and myocardium in the distal ventricle. In addition to expressing Ltbp3, a protein that regulates the bioavailability of TGF-beta ligands(11), zebrafish SHF cells co-express nkx2.5, an evolutionarily conserved marker of cardiac progenitor cells in both fields(4). Embryos devoid of ltbp3 lack the same cardiac structures derived from ltbp3(+) cells due to compromised progenitor proliferation. Furthermore, small-molecule inhibition of TGF-beta signalling phenocopies the ltbp3-morphant phenotype whereas expression of a constitutively active TGF-beta type I receptor rescues it. Taken together, our findings uncover a requirement for ltbp3-TGF-beta signalling during zebrafish SHF development, a process that serves to enlarge the single ventricular chamber in this species.","[Zhou, Yong; Cashman, Timothy J.; Nevis, Kathleen R.; Obregon, Pablo; Gu, Aihua; Sondalle, Samuel; Burns, Caroline E.; Burns, C.

MicroRNAs have been identified as a new class of regulatory molecules that influence many biological functions, including metabolism(4,5). However, the direct regulation of insulin sensitivity by microRNAs in vivo has not been demonstrated. Here we show that the expression of microRNAs 103 and 107 (miR-103/107) is upregulated in obese mice. Silencing of miR-103/107 leads to improved glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. In contrast, gain of miR-103/107 function in either liver or fat is sufficient to induce impaired glucose homeostasis. We identify caveolin-1, a critical regulator of the insulin receptor, as a direct target gene of miR-103/107. We demonstrate that caveolin-1 is upregulated upon miR-103/107 inactivation in adipocytes and that this is concomitant with stabilization of the insulin receptor, enhanced insulin signalling, decreased adipocyte size and enhanced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. These findings demonstrate the central importance of miR-103/107 to insulin sensitivity and identify a new target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity.","[Trajkovski, Mirko; Hausser, Jean; Heim, Markus H.; Stoffel, Markus] ETH, Competence Ctr Syst Physiol & Metab Dis, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Trajkovski, Mirko; Stoffel, Markus] ETH, Inst Mol Syst Biol, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Hausser, Jean; Zavolan, Mihaela] Univ Basel, Biozentrum Basel, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; [Soutschek, Juergen; Bhat, Bal] Regulus Therapeut Inc, San Diego, CA 92121 USA; [Akin, Akinc] Alnylam Pharmaceut, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Heim, Markus H.] Univ Basel Hosp, CH-4031 Basel, Switzerland","Stoffel, M (reprint author), ETH, Competence Ctr Syst Physiol & Metab Dis, Schafmattstr 18,HPM F 39-1, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",stoffel@imsb.biol.ethz.ch,"Xie, Huangming/B-2260-2012","Hausser, Jean/0000-0002-3321-7199; Heim, Markus/0000-0002-7523-4894; Zavolan, Mihaela/0000-0002-8832-2041",Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF); European Community; Leducq Foundation,"We would like to thank F.

Here we identify SAMHD1 as this restriction factor. SAMHD1 is a protein involved in Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome, a genetic encephalopathy with symptoms mimicking congenital viral infection, that has been proposed to act as a negative regulator of the interferon response(7). We show that Vpx induces proteasomal degradation of SAMHD1. Silencing of SAMHD1 in non-permissive cell lines alleviates HIV-1 restriction and is associated with a significant accumulation of viral DNA in infected cells. Concurrently, overexpression of SAMHD1 in sensitive cells inhibits HIV-1 infection. The putative phosphohydrolase activity of SAMHD1 is probably required for HIV-1 restriction. Vpx-mediated relief of restriction is abolished in SAMHD1-negative cells. Finally, silencing of SAMHD1 markedly increases the susceptibility of monocytic-derived dendritic cells to infection. Our results demonstrate that SAMHD1 is an antiretroviral protein expressed in cells of the myeloid lineage that inhibits an early step of the viral life cycle.","[Laguette, Nadine; Sobhian, Bijan; Ringeard, Mathieu; Chable-Bessia, Christine; Yatim, Ahmad; Benkirane, Monsef] CNRS, Inst Genet Humaine, Lab Virol Mol, UPR1142, F-34000 Montpellier, France; [Casartelli, Nicoletta; Schwartz, Olivier] CNRS, Inst Pasteur, Virus & Immun Unit, URA 3015, Paris, France; [Segeral, Emmanuel; Emiliani, Stephane] Univ Paris 05, CNRS, Inst Cochin, UMR 8104,INSERM,U567, Paris, France","Benkirane, M (reprint author), CNRS, Inst Genet Humaine, Lab Virol Mol, UPR1142, F-34000 Montpellier, France.",nadine.laguette@igh.cnrs.fr; monsef.benkirane@igh.cnrs.fr,"Casartelli, Nicoletta/L-4798-2015",,ERC [250333]; Sidaction; ANRS; FRM 'equipe labellisee'; CNRS/region Languedoc Roussillon; European FP7 [201412]; Institut Pasteur,"We wish to thank members of the Molecular Virology laboratory for critical reading of the manuscript, N.

Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) fails to transduce dendritic cells and has a reduced ability to transduce macrophages, due to an as yet uncharacterized mechanism that inhibits infection by interfering with efficient synthesis of viral complementary DNA(3,4). In contrast, HIV-2 and related simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVsm/mac) transduce myeloid cells efficiently owing to their virion-associated Vpx accessory proteins, which counteract the restrictive mechanism(5,6). Here we show that the inhibition of HIV-1 infection in macrophages involves the cellular SAM domain HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1). Vpx relieves the inhibition of lentivirus infection in macrophages by loading SAMHD1 onto the CRL4(DCAF1) E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to highly efficient proteasome-dependent degradation of the protein. Mutations in SAMHD1 cause Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome, a disease that produces a phenotype that mimics the effects of a congenital viral infection(7,8). Failure to dispose of endogenous nucleic acid debris in Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome results in inappropriate triggering of innate immune responses via cytosolic nucleic acids sensors(9,10). Thus, our findings show that macrophages are defended from HIV-1 infection by a mechanism that prevents an unwanted interferon response triggered by self nucleic acids, and uncover an intricate relationship between innate immune mechanisms that control response to self and to retroviral pathogens.","[Hrecka, Kasia; Hao, Caili; Kesik-Brodacka, Malgorzata; Skowronski, Jacek] Case Sch Med, Dept Mol Biol & Microbiol, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Hrecka, Kasia; Gierszewska, Magda; Srivastava, Smita; Skowronski, Jacek] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; [Swanson, Selene K.; Florens, Laurence; Washburn, Michael P.] Stowers Inst Med Res, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; [Washburn, Michael P.] Univ Kansas, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Med Ctr, Kansas City, KS 66160 USA","Skowronski, J (reprint author), Case Sch Med, Dept Mol Biol & Microbiol, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",jacek.skowronski@case.edu,,"Florens, Laurence/0000-0002-9310-6650; Washburn, Michael/0000-0001-7568-2585","NIH [R01 AI077459, R21 AI084694]; Case CFAR developmental funds; Stowers Institute for Medical Research","We thank the Karn, McDonald and Bernstein laboratories, C.

Seventy-five per cent of the eukaryotic proteome consists of multidomain proteins, yet it is not understood how interdomain misfolding is avoided. It has been proposed that maintaining low sequence identity between covalently linked domains is a mechanism to avoid misfolding(3). Here we use single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer(4,5) to detect and quantify rare misfolding events in tandem immunoglobulin domains from the I band of titin under native conditions. About 5.5 per cent of molecules with identical domains misfold during refolding in vitro and form an unexpectedly stable state with an unfolding half-time of several days. Tandem arrays of immunoglobulin-like domains in humans show significantly lower sequence identity between neighbouring domains than between non-adjacent domains(3). In particular, the sequence identity of neighbouring domains has been found to be preferentially below 40 per cent(3). We observe no misfolding for a tandem of naturally neighbouring domains with low sequence identity (24 per cent), whereas misfolding occurs between domains that are 42 per cent identical. Coarse-grained molecular simulations predict the formation of domain-swapped structures that are in excellent agreement with the observed transfer efficiency of the misfolded species. We infer that the interactions underlying misfolding are very specific and result in a sequence-specific domain-swapping mechanism. Diversifying the sequence between neighbouring domains seems to be a successful evolutionary strategy to avoid misfolding in multidomain proteins.","[Borgia, Madeleine B.; Best, Robert B.; Steward, Annette; Clarke, Jane] Univ Cambridge, Chem Lab, Cambridge CB2 1EW, England; [Borgia, Madeleine B.; Borgia, Alessandro; Nettels, Daniel; Wunderlich, Bengt; Schuler, Benjamin] Univ Zurich, Inst Biochem, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland","Clarke, J (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Chem Lab, Lensfield Rd, Cambridge CB2 1EW, England.",schuler@bioc.uzh.ch; jc162@cam.ac.uk,"Schuler, Benjamin/E-7342-2011; Best, Robert/H-7588-2016","Schuler, Benjamin/0000-0002-5970-4251; Best, Robert/0000-0002-7893-3543",Wellcome Trust [064417]; Swiss National Science Foundation; Swiss National Center of Competence in Research in Structural Biology; UK Medical Research Council; Marie Curie Intra-European Fellowship; Royal Society,"This work was supported by the Wellcome Trust (grant number, 064417), the Swiss National Science Foundation (to B.

Challenges in achieving their isolation in sufficient quantity from natural sources, coupled with an inability to prepare them easily synthetically, are seen as the main obstacles. Here we report a programmable, controlled and potentially scalable synthesis of the resveratrol family via a three-stage design. The synthetic approach requires strategy- and reagent-guided chemical functionalizations to differentiate two distinct cores possessing multiple sites with the same or similar reactivity, ultimately leading to five higher-order natural products. This work demonstrates that challenging, positionally selective functionalizations of complex materials are possible where biosynthetic studies have indicated otherwise, it provides materials and tools with which to unlock the full biochemical potential of this family of natural products, and it affords an intellectual framework within which other oligomeric families could potentially be accessed.","[Snyder, Scott A.; Gollner, Andreas; Chiriac, Maria I.] Columbia Univ, Dept Chem, New York, NY 10027 USA","Snyder, SA (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Dept Chem, Havemeyer Hall,3000 Broadway, New York, NY 10027 USA.",sas2197@columbia.edu,,"Snyder, Scott/0000-0003-3594-8769",Columbia University; National Institutes of Health [R01-GM84994]; Bristol-Myers Squibb; Eli Lilly; Research Corporation for Science Advancement; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [J2986-N19],"We thank G.

Here we report the structure of the Arabidopsis thaliana BRI1 ligand-binding domain, determined by X-ray diffraction at 2.5 angstrom resolution. We find a superhelix of 25 twisted leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), an architecture that is strikingly different from the assembly of LRRs in animal Toll-like receptors. A 70-amino-acid island domain between LRRs 21 and 22 folds back into the interior of the superhelix to create a surface pocket for binding the plant hormone brassinolide. Known loss- and gain-of-function mutations map closely to the hormone-binding site. We propose that steroid binding to BRI1 generates a docking platform for a co-receptor that is required for receptor activation. Our findings provide insight into the activation mechanism of this highly expanded family of plant receptors that have essential roles in hormone, developmental and innate immunity signalling.","[Hothorn, Michael; Belkhadir, Youssef; Dabi, Tsegaye; Chory, Joanne] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Plant Biol Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Belkhadir, Youssef; Dabi, Tsegaye; Noel, Joseph.

The localization of condensin at chromosome arms is crucial for chromosome partitioning during anaphase. Condensin is also enriched at kinetochores but its precise role and loading machinery remain unclear. Here we show that fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) kinetochore proteins Pcs1 and Mde4-homologues of budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) monopolin subunits and known to prevent merotelic kinetochore orientation-act as a condensin 'recruiter' at kinetochores, and that condensin itself may act to clamp microtubule binding sites during metaphase. In addition to the regional recruitment factors, overall condensin association with chromatin is governed by the chromosomal passenger kinase Aurora B. Aurora-B-dependent phosphorylation of condensin promotes its association with histone H2A and H2A.Z, which we identify as conserved chromatin 'receptors' of condensin. Condensin phosphorylation and its deposition onto chromosome arms reach a peak during anaphase, when Aurora B kinase relocates from centromeres to the spindle midzone, where the separating chromosome arms are positioned.

After the initial flash of light from shock heating, the fading light emitted by the supernova is due to the decay of these elements(2). However, after decades, the energy powering a supernova remnant comes from the shock interaction between the ejecta and the surrounding medium(3). The transition to this phase has hitherto not been observed: supernovae occur too infrequently in the Milky Way to provide a young example, and extragalactic supernovae are generally too faint and too small. Here we report observations that show this transition in the supernova SN 1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud. From 1994 to 2001, the ejecta faded owing to radioactive decay of (44)Ti as predicted. Then the flux started to increase, more than doubling by the end of 2009. We show that this increase is the result of heat deposited by X-rays produced as the ejecta interacts with the surrounding material. In time, the X-rays will penetrate farther into the ejecta, enabling us to analyse the structure and chemistry of the vanished star.","[Larsson, J.; Fransson, C.; Ostlin, G.; Groningsson, P.; Jerkstrand, A.; Kozma, C.; Sollerman, J.; Lundqvist, P.] Stockholm Univ, Dept Astron, Oskar Klein Ctr, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Challis, P.; Kirshner, R.

In all known supernovae, this radiation comes from internal energy deposited in the outflowing ejecta by one or more of the following processes: radioactive decay of freshly synthesized elements(2) (typically Ni-56), the explosion shock in the envelope of a supergiant star(3), and interaction between the debris and slowly moving, hydrogen-rich circumstellar material(4). Here we report observations of a class of luminous supernovae whose properties cannot be explained by any of these processes. The class includes four new supernovae that we have discovered and two previously unexplained events(5,6) (SN 2005ap and SCP 06F6) that we can now identify as members of the same class. These supernovae are all about ten times brighter than most type Ia supernova, do not show any trace of hydrogen, emit significant ultraviolet flux for extended periods of time and have late-time decay rates that are inconsistent with radioactivity. Our data require that the observed radiation be emitted by hydrogen-free material distributed over a large radius (similar to 10(15) centimetres) and expanding at high speeds (>10(4) kilometres per second).

Alternatives have been explored-notably theories relying on joint probability distributions or non-contextual hidden-variable models, in which the properties of a system are defined independently of their own measurement and any other measurements that are made. Various deep theoretical results(2-5) imply that such theories are in conflict with quantum mechanics. Simpler cases demonstrating this conflict have been found(6-10) and tested experimentally(11,12) with pairs of quantum bits (qubits). Recently, an inequality satisfied by non-contextual hidden-variable models and violated by quantum mechanics for all states of two qubits was introduced(13) and tested experimentally(14-16). A single three-state system (a qutrit) is the simplest system in which such a contradiction is possible; moreover, the contradiction cannot result from entanglement between subsystems, because such a three-state system is indivisible. Here we report an experiment with single photonic qutrits(17,18) which provides evidence that no joint probability distribution describing the outcomes of all possible measurements-and, therefore, no non-contextual theory-can exist. Specifically, we observe a violation of the Bell-type inequality found by Klyachko, Can, Binicioglu and Shumovsky(19). Our results illustrate a deep incompatibility between quantum mechanics and classical physics that cannot in any way result from entanglement.","[Lapkiewicz, Radek; Li, Peizhe; Schaeff, Christoph; Langford, Nathan K.; Ramelow, Sven; Wiesniak, Marcin; Zeilinger, Anton] Univ Vienna, Vienna Ctr Quantum Sci & Technol, Fac Phys, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Lapkiewicz, Radek; Schaeff, Christoph; Langford, Nathan K.; Ramelow, Sven; Zeilinger, Anton] Austrian Acad Sci, Inst Quantum Opt & Quantum Informat, A-1090 Vienna, Austria","Zeilinger, A (reprint author), Univ Vienna, Vienna Ctr Quantum Sci & Technol, Fac Phys, Boltzmanngasse 5, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",anton.zeilinger@univie.ac.at,"Langford, Nathan/A-5699-2012; Ramelow, Sven/H-6798-2012; Lapkiewicz, Radek/B-5786-2015","Langford, Nathan/0000-0003-4338-3059; Ramelow, Sven/0000-0002-7801-4440; ",ERC [QIT4QAD]; Austrian Science Fund [F4007]; EC (Marie Curie Research Training Network EMALI); Vienna Doctoral Program on Complex Quantum Systems; John Templeton Foundation,"This work was supported by the ERC (Advanced Grant QIT4QAD), the Austrian Science Fund (Grant F4007), the EC (Marie Curie Research Training Network EMALI), the Vienna Doctoral Program on Complex Quantum Systems and the John Templeton Foundation.

Further, flying in a flock can result in aerodynamic benefits, thus reducing power requirements(4), as demonstrated by a reduction in heart rate and wingbeat frequency in pelicans flying in a V-formation(5). But how general is an aerodynamic power reduction due to group-flight? V-formation flocks are limited to moderately steady flight in relatively large birds, and may represent a special case. What are the aerodynamic consequences of flying in the more usual 'cluster'(6,7) flock? Here we use data from innovative back-mounted Global Positioning System (GPS) and 6-degrees-of-freedom inertial sensors to show that pigeons (1) maintain powered, banked turns like aircraft, imposing dorsal accelerations of up to 2g, effectively doubling body weight and quadrupling induced power requirements; (2) increase flap frequency with increases in all conventional aerodynamic power requirements; and (3) increase flap frequency when flying near, particularly behind, other birds. Therefore, unlike V-formation pelicans, pigeons do not gain an aerodynamic advantage from flying in a flock. Indeed, the increased flap frequency, whether due to direct aerodynamic interactions or requirements for increased stability or control, suggests a considerable energetic cost to flight in a tight cluster flock.","[Usherwood, James R.; Stavrou, Marinos; Lowe, John C.; Roskilly, Kyle; Wilson, Alan M.] Univ London, Struct & Mot Lab, Royal Vet Coll, Hatfield AL9 7TA, Herts, England","Usherwood, JR (reprint author), Univ London, Struct & Mot Lab, Royal Vet Coll, Hatfield AL9 7TA, Herts, England.",jusherwood@rvc.ac.uk,,,Wellcome Trust; Royal Society; BBSRC; EPSRC,"We would like to thank T.

Cities have both health risks and benefits(1), but mental health is negatively affected: mood and anxiety disorders are more prevalent in city dwellers(2) and the incidence of schizophrenia is strongly increased in people born and raised in cities(3-6). Although these findings have been widely attributed to the urban social environment(2,3,7,8), the neural processes that could mediate such associations are unknown. Here we show, using functional magnetic resonance imaging in three independent experiments, that urban upbringing and city living have dissociable impacts on social evaluative stress processing in humans. Current city living was associated with increased amygdala activity, whereas urban upbringing affected the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex, a key region for regulation of amygdala activity, negative affect(9) and stress(10). These findings were regionally and behaviourally specific, as no other brain structures were affected and no urbanicity effect was seen during control experiments invoking cognitive processing without stress. Our results identify distinct neural mechanisms for an established environmental risk factor, link the urban environment for the first time to social stress processing, suggest that brain regions differ in vulnerability to this risk factor across the lifespan, and indicate that experimental interrogation of epidemiological associations is a promising strategy in social neuroscience.","[Lederbogen, Florian; Kirsch, Peter; Haddad, Leila; Streit, Fabian; Tost, Heike; Schuch, Philipp; Wuest, Stefan; Rietschel, Marcella; Deuschle, Michael; Meyer-Lindenberg, Andreas] Univ Heidelberg, Cent Inst Mental Hlth, Fac Med, D-68159 Mannheim, Germany; [Pruessner, Jens C.] McGill Univ, Douglas Mental Hlth Univ Inst, Verdun, PQ H4H 1R3, Canada","Meyer-Lindenberg, A (reprint author), Univ Heidelberg, Cent Inst Mental Hlth, Fac Med, D-68159 Mannheim, Germany.",a.meyer-lindenberg@zi-mannheim.de,"Deuschle, Michael/E-4638-2012; Meyer-Lindenberg, Andreas/H-1076-2011","Meyer-Lindenberg, Andreas/0000-0001-5619-1123; Kirsch, Peter/0000-0002-0817-1248; Streit, Fabian/0000-0003-1080-4339",European Community [HEALTH-F2-2010-241909]; German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) [SFB 636-B7]; Federal Ministry of Education and Research (MooDS),"We thank D.

The resultant decline in the efficiency of selection seems to be sufficient to influence a wide range of attributes at the genomic level in a non-adaptive manner(2). A key remaining question concerns the extent to which variation in the power of random genetic drift is capable of influencing phylogenetic diversity at the subcellular and cellular levels(2-4). Should this be the case, population size would have to be considered as a potential determinant of the mechanistic pathways underlying long-term phenotypic evolution. Here we demonstrate a phylogenetically broad inverse relation between the power of drift and the structural integrity of protein subunits. This leads to the hypothesis that the accumulation of mildly deleterious mutations in populations of small size induces secondary selection for protein-protein interactions that stabilize key gene functions. By this means, the complex protein architectures and interactions essential to the genesis of phenotypic diversity may initially emerge by non-adaptive mechanisms.","[Lynch, Michael] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Fernandez, Ariel] Univ Chicago, Dept Comp Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Fernandez, Ariel] Rice Univ, Dept Bioengn, Houston, TX 77005 USA","Lynch, M (reprint author), Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",ariel@uchicago.edu; milynch@indiana.edu,"Fernandez, Ariel/I-7925-2016","Fernandez, Ariel/0000-0002-5102-4294","National Institutes of Health [R01GM072614, R01GM036827]; Institute of Biophysical Dynamics; Department of Computer Science at The University of Chicago; National Science Foundation [EF-0827411]","A.F. was supported by National Institutes of Health grant R01GM072614, and by the Institute of Biophysical Dynamics and the Department of Computer Science at The University of Chicago.

DLPC treatment induces bile acid biosynthetic enzymes in mouse liver, increases bile acid levels, and lowers hepatic triglycerides and serum glucose. DLPC treatment also decreases hepatic steatosis and improves glucose homeostasis in two mouse models of insulin resistance.

Here we show that during development, retinal myeloid cells (RMCs) produce Wnt ligands to regulate blood vessel branching. In the mouse retina, where angiogenesis occurs postnatally(1), somatic deletion in RMCs of the Wnt ligand transporter Wntless(2,3) results in increased angiogenesis in the deeper layers. We also show that mutation of Wnt5a and Wnt11 results in increased angiogenesis and that these ligands elicit RMC responses via a non-canonical Wnt pathway. Using cultured myeloid-like cells and RMC somatic deletion of Flt1, we show that an effector of Wnt-dependent suppression of angiogenesis by RMCs is Flt1, a naturally occurring inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)(4-6). These findings indicate that resident myeloid cells can use a non-canonical, Wnt-Flt1 pathway to suppress angiogenic branching.","[Stefater, James A., III; Rao, Sujata; Carpenter, April C.; Fan, Jieqing; Lang, Richard A.] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp, Visual Syst Grp, Div Pediat Ophthalmol, Med Ctr, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Stefater, James A., III; Rao, Sujata; Carpenter, April C.; Fan, Jieqing; Lang, Richard A.] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp, Div Dev Biol, Med Ctr, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Stefater, James A., III; Rao, Sujata] Univ Cincinnati, Dept Ophthalmol, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Lewkowich, Ian; Wills-Karp, Marsha] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp, Div Immunobiol, Med Ctr, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Mariggi, Giovanni; Gerhardt, Holger] Canc Res UK, Vasc Biol Lab, London Res Inst, London WC2 3PX, England; [Burr, Adam R.; Molkentin, Jeffery D.] Univ Cincinnati, Div Mol Cardiovasc Biol, Cincinnati Childrens Hosp, Med Ctr, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Ajima, Rieko; Yamaguchi, Terry] NCI, Canc & Dev Biol Lab, Frederick, MD 21701 USA; [Molkentin, Jeffery D.] Univ Cincinnati, Med Ctr, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cincinnati Childrens Hosp, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Williams, Bart O.] Van Andel Res Inst, Ctr Skeletal Dis Res, Grand Rapids, MI 49503 USA; [Pollard, Jeffrey W.] Yeshiva Univ, Albert Einstein Coll Med, Bronx, NY 10461 USA; [Ferrara, Napoleone] Genentech Inc, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Gerhardt, Holger] VIB, Vasc Patterning Lab, Vesalius Res Ctr, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium","Lang, RA (reprint author), Cincinnati Childrens Hosp, Visual Syst Grp, Div Pediat Ophthalmol, Med Ctr, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA.",richard.lang@cchmc.org,"Lang, Richard/E-5578-2011; Williams, Bart/A-3539-2013; Gerhardt, Holger/G-4610-2011","Williams, Bart/0000-0002-5261-5301; Gerhardt, Holger/0000-0002-3030-0384",NIH; HHMI; Cancer Research UK,"We thank P.

Elaborate chromatin remodelling mechanisms have evolved that govern nucleosome organization at promoters, regulatory elements, and other functional regions in the genome(1). Analyses of chromatin landscape have uncovered a variety of mechanisms, including DNA sequence preferences, that can influence nucleosome positions(2-4). To identify major determinants of nucleosome organization in the human genome, we used deep sequencing to map nucleosome positions in three primary human cell types and in vitro. A majority of the genome showed substantial flexibility of nucleosome positions, whereas a small fraction showed reproducibly positioned nucleosomes. Certain sites that position in vitro can anchor the formation of nucleosomal arrays that have cell type-specific spacing in vivo. Our results unveil an interplay of sequence-based nucleosome preferences and non-nucleosomal factors in determining nucleosome organization within mammalian cells.","[Valouev, Anton; Boyd, Scott D.; Smith, Cheryl L.; Fire, Andrew Z.; Sidow, Arend] Stanford Univ, Dept Pathol, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Johnson, Steven M.] Brigham Young Univ, Dept Microbiol & Mol Biol, Provo, UT 84602 USA; [Fire, Andrew Z.; Sidow, Arend] Stanford Univ, Dept Genet, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Sidow, A (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Pathol, Sch Med, 300 Pasteur Dr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",afire@stanford.edu; arend@stanford.edu,"Johnson, Steven/B-3940-2013",,"NIGMS [R01GM37706]; NHGRI [U01HG004695, T32HG00044]","This work was supported by the Stanford Genetics/Pathology Sequencing Initiative.

GPCRs have similar structures consisting of seven transmembrane helices that contain well-conserved sequence motifs, indicating that they are probably activated by a common mechanism(3,4). Recent structures of beta-adrenoceptors highlight residues in transmembrane region 5 that initially bind specifically to agonists rather than to antagonists, indicating that these residues have an important role in agonist-induced activation of receptors(5-7). Here we present two crystal structures of the thermostabilized human adenosine A(2A) receptor (A(2A)R-GL31) bound to its endogenous agonist adenosine and the synthetic agonist NECA. The structures represent an intermediate conformation between the inactive and active states, because they share all the features of GPCRs that are thought to be in a fully activated state, except that the cytoplasmic end of transmembrane helix 6 partially occludes the G-protein-binding site. The adenine substituent of the agonists binds in a similar fashion to the chemically related region of the inverse agonist ZM241385 (ref. 8). Both agonists contain a ribose group, not found in ZM241385, which extends deep into the ligand-binding pocket where it makes polar interactions with conserved residues in H7 (Ser 277(7.42) and His 278(7.43); superscripts refer to Ballesteros-Weinstein numbering(9)) and non-polar interactions with residues in H3. In contrast, the inverse agonist ZM241385 does not interact with any of these residues and comparison with the agonist-bound structures indicates that ZM241385 sterically prevents the conformational change in H5 and therefore it acts as an inverse agonist. Comparison of the agonist-bound structures of A(2A)R with the agonist-bound structures of beta-adrenoceptors indicates that the contraction of the ligand-binding pocket caused by the inward motion of helices 3, 5 and 7 may be a common feature in the activation of all GPCRs.","[Lebon, Guillaume; Warne, Tony; Edwards, Patricia C.; Leslie, Andrew G.

Although other, structurally unrelated, neurotransmitter-gated cation channels exist, no other type of neurotransmitter-gated anion channel, and thus no other source of fast synaptic inhibitory signals, has been described so far. In addition to the seemingly straightforward electrostatic effect of the presence (in the cation-selective members) or absence (in the anion-selective ones) of a ring of pore-facing carboxylates, mutational studies have identified other features of the amino-acid sequence near the intracellular end of the pore-lining transmembrane segments (M2) that are also required to achieve the high charge selectivity shown by native channels(1-10). However, the mechanism underlying this more subtle effect has remained elusive(11) and a subject of speculation. Here we show, using single-channel electrophysiological recordings to estimate the protonation state of native ionizable side chains, that anion-selective-type sequences favour whereas cation-selective-type sequences prevent the protonation of the conserved, buried basic residues at the intracellular entrance of the pore (the M2 0' position). We conclude that the previously unrecognized tunable charge state of the 0' ring of buried basic side chains is an essential feature of these channels' versatile charge-selectivity filter.","[Cymes, Gisela D.; Grosman, Claudio] Univ Illinois, Ctr Biophys & Computat Biol, Dept Mol & Integrat Physiol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Cymes, Gisela D.; Grosman, Claudio] Univ Illinois, Neurosci Program, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Grosman, C (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Ctr Biophys & Computat Biol, Dept Mol & Integrat Physiol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",grosman@illinois.edu,,,US National Institutes of Health [R01-NS042169],"We thank S.

Force-dependent activation requires unfastening of a 'straitjacket' that encircles each growth-factor monomer at a position that can be locked by a disulphide bond. Sequences of all 33 TGF-beta family members indicate a similar prodomain fold. The structure provides insights into the regulation of a family of growth and differentiation factors of fundamental importance in morphogenesis and homeostasis.","[Shi, Minlong; Zhu, Jianghai; Wang, Rui; Chen, Xing; Mi, Lizhi; Springer, Timothy A.] Childrens Hosp, Immune Dis Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Shi, Minlong; Zhu, Jianghai; Wang, Rui; Chen, Xing; Mi, Lizhi; Springer, Timothy A.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Walz, Thomas] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Walz, Thomas] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Springer, TA (reprint author), Childrens Hosp, Immune Dis Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",springer@idi.harvard.edu,"shi, minlong/G-8734-2013; Zhu, Jianghai/B-7339-2014; Mi, Li-Zhi/B-1371-2016","Mi, Li-Zhi/0000-0001-9907-5245",Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NHLBI NIH HHS [P01 HL103526],,,46,297,305,1,32,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,16-Jun,2011,474,7351,,,,,343,U370,,10.1038/nature10152,,9,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,777TD,WOS:000291647100038,21677751.0,No,,,11/20/17,timothy a.,springer,na,na,na,na,na

Although some black holes with masses more than 10(9) times that of the Sun have been detected in luminous quasars less than one billion years after the Big Bang(4,5), these individual extreme objects have limited utility in constraining the channels of formation of the earliest black holes; this is because the initial conditions of black hole seed properties are quickly erased during the growth process(6). Here we report a measurement of the amount of black hole growth in galaxies at redshift z = 6-8 (0.95-0.7 billion years after the Big Bang), based on optimally stacked, archival X-ray observations. Our results imply that black holes grow in tandem with their host galaxies throughout cosmic history, starting from the earliest times. We find that most copiously accreting black holes at these epochs are buried in significant amounts of gas and dust that absorb most radiation except for the highest-energy X-rays. This suggests that black holes grew significantly more during these early bursts than was previously thought, but because of the obscuration of their ultraviolet emission they did not contribute to the re-ionization of the Universe.","[Treister, Ezequiel] Univ Hawaii, Inst Astron, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Treister, Ezequiel] Univ Concepcion, Dept Astron, Concepcion, Chile; [Schawinski, Kevin; Natarajan, Priyamvada] Yale Ctr Astron & Astrophys, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Schawinski, Kevin; Natarajan, Priyamvada] Yale Univ, Dept Phys, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Volonteri, Marta] Univ Michigan, Dept Astron, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Natarajan, Priyamvada] Yale Univ, Dept Astron, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Natarajan, Priyamvada] Harvard Univ, Inst Theory & Computat, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Gawiser, Eric] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA","Treister, E (reprint author), Univ Hawaii, Inst Astron, 2680 Woodlawn Dr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",treister@ifa.hawaii.edu,,"Schawinski, Kevin/0000-0001-5464-0888; Treister, Ezequiel/0000-0001-7568-6412",,,,30,52,52,1,3,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,16-Jun,2011,474,7351,,,,,356,358,,10.1038/nature10103,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,777TD,WOS:000291647100040,21677753.0,No,,,11/20/17,eric,gawiser,male,1,4110,D5b2ctAAAAAJ,12277

It is now similar to 22 AU past the termination shock crossing(4). The bulk velocity of the plasma in the radial-transverse plane has been determined(5) using measurements of the anisotropy of the convected energetic ion distribution(6).

The quantum superpositions underlying entanglement are at the heart of the intricate interplay of localized spin states and itinerant electronic states that gives rise to the Kondo effect in certain dilute magnetic alloys(1). In systems where the density of localized spin states is sufficiently high, they can no longer be treated as non-interacting; if they form a dense periodic array, a Kondo lattice may be established(1). Such a Kondo lattice gives rise to the emergence of charge carriers with enhanced effective masses, but the precise nature of the coherent Kondo state responsible for the generation of these heavy fermions remains highly debated(1-3). Here we use atomic-resolution tunnelling spectroscopy to investigate the low-energy excitations of a generic Kondo lattice system, YbRh2Si2. We find that the hybridization of the conduction electrons with the localized 4f electrons results in a decrease in the tunnelling conductance at the Fermi energy. In addition, we observe unambiguously the crystal-field excitations of the Yb3+ ions. A strongly temperature-dependent peak in the tunnelling conductance is attributed to the Fano resonance(4,5) resulting from tunnelling into the coherent heavy-fermion states that emerge at low temperature. Taken together, these features reveal how quantum coherence develops in heavy 4f-electron Kondo lattices. Our results demonstrate the efficiency of real-space electronic structure imaging for the investigation of strong electronic correlations(6,7), specifically with respect to coherence phenomena, phase coexistence and quantum criticality.","[Ernst, S.; Kirchner, S.; Krellner, C.; Geibel, C.; Steglich, F.; Wirth, S.] Max Planck Inst Chem Phys Solids, D-01187 Dresden, Germany; [Kirchner, S.] Max Planck Inst Phys Komplexer Syst, D-01187 Dresden, Germany; [Zwicknagl, G.] TU Braunschweig, Inst Math Phys, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany","Wirth, S (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Chem Phys Solids, Nothnitzer Str 40, D-01187 Dresden, Germany.",wirth@cpfs.mpg.de,"Krellner, Cornelius/A-5389-2009; Kirchner, Stefan/L-5971-2013","Krellner, Cornelius/0000-0002-0671-7729; ",,,,31,73,74,2,75,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,16-Jun,2011,474,7351,,,,,362,366,,10.1038/nature10148,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,777TD,WOS:000291647100042,21677755.0,No,,,11/20/17,s.,wirth,female,1,1,k4kAfBcAAAAJ,23337

Empirical rules exist for their assembly but it is still challenging to place and segregate functionality in three-dimensional porous solids in a predictable way. Indeed, recent studies of mixed crystalline frameworks suggest a preference for the statistical distribution of functionalities throughout the pores(7) rather than, for example, the functional group localization found in the reactive sites of enzymes(8). This is a potential limitation for 'one-pot' chemical syntheses of porous frameworks from simple starting materials. An alternative strategy is to prepare porous solids from synthetically preorganized molecular pores(9-15). In principle, functional organic pore modules could be covalently prefabricated and then assembled to produce materials with specific properties. However, this vision of mix-and-match assembly is far from being realized, not least because of the challenge in reliably predicting three-dimensional structures for molecular crystals, which lack the strong directional bonding found in networks. Here we show that highly porous crystalline solids can be produced by mixing different organic cage modules that self-assemble by means of chiral recognition. The structures of the resulting materials can be predicted computationally(16,17), allowing in silico materials design strategies(18). The constituent pore modules are synthesized in high yields on gram scales in a one-step reaction. Assembly of the porous co-crystals is as simple as combining the modules in solution and removing the solvent. In some cases, the chiral recognition between modules can be exploited to produce porous organic nanoparticles. We show that the method is valid for four different cage modules and can in principle be generalized in a computationally predictable manner based on a lock-and-key assembly between modules.","[Jones, James T.

Experimental and clinical evidence indicate that prefrontal dopamine has an important role in cognitive functions(3), acting predominantly through D1 receptors. Here we show that dopamine D1 receptors mediate prefrontal control of signals in the visual cortex of macaques (Macaca mulatta). We pharmacologically altered D1-receptor-mediated activity in the frontal eye field of the prefrontal cortex and measured the effect on the responses of neurons in area V4 of the visual cortex. This manipulation was sufficient to enhance the magnitude, the orientation selectivity and the reliability of V4 visual responses to an extent comparable with the known effects of top-down attention. The enhancement of V4 signals was restricted to neurons with response fields overlapping the part of visual space affected by the D1 receptor manipulation. Altering either D1- or D2-receptor-mediated frontal eye field activity increased saccadic target selection but the D2 receptor manipulation did not enhance V4 signals. Our results identify a role for D1 receptors in mediating the control of visual cortical signals by the prefrontal cortex and suggest how processing in sensory areas could be altered in mental disorders involving prefrontal dopamine.","[Noudoost, Behrad; Moore, Tirin] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Noudoost, Behrad; Moore, Tirin] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Noudoost, B (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Fairchild Bldg,299 Campus Dr W, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",behrad@stanford.edu,,,"Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NEI NIH HHS [R56 EY014924, EY014924, R01 EY014924, R01 EY014924-04, R01 EY014924-05, R01 EY014924-06A2]",,,30,123,123,2,24,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,16-Jun,2011,474,7351,,,,,372,375,,10.1038/nature09995,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,777TD,WOS:000291647100044,21572439.0,No,,,11/20/17,tirin,moore,na,na,na,na,na

As hair bundles move, the viscous friction between stereocilia and the surrounding liquid poses a fundamental physical challenge to the ear's high sensitivity and sharp frequency selectivity. Part of the solution to this problem lies in the active process that uses energy for frequency-selective sound amplification(2,3). Here we demonstrate that a complementary part of the solution involves the fluid-structure interaction between the liquid within the hair bundle and the stereocilia. Using force measurement on a dynamically scaled model, finite-element analysis, analytical estimation of hydrodynamic forces, stochastic simulation and high-resolution interferometric measurement of hair bundles, we characterize the origin and magnitude of the forces between individual stereocilia during small hair-bundle deflections. We find that the close apposition of stereocilia effectively immobilizes the liquid between them, which reduces the drag and suppresses the relative squeezing but not the sliding mode of stereociliary motion. The obliquely oriented tip links couple the mechanotransduction channels to this least dissipative coherent mode, whereas the elastic horizontal top connectors that stabilize the structure further reduce the drag. As measured from the distortion products associated with channel gating at physiological stimulation amplitudes of tens of nanometres, the balance of viscous and elastic forces in a hair bundle permits a relative mode of motion between adjacent stereocilia that encompasses only a fraction of a nanometre. A combination of high-resolution experiments and detailed numerical modelling of fluid-structure interactions reveals the physical principles behind the basic structural features of hair bundles and shows quantitatively how these organelles are adapted to the needs of sensitive mechanotransduction.","[Kozlov, Andrei S.; Versteegh, Corstiaen P.

Thus, a fundamental question is whether autism represents an aetiologically heterogeneous disorder in which the myriad genetic or environmental risk factors perturb common underlying molecular pathways in the brain(4). Here, we demonstrate consistent differences in transcriptome organization between autistic and normal brain by gene co-expression network analysis. Remarkably, regional patterns of gene expression that typically distinguish frontal and temporal cortex are significantly attenuated in the ASD brain, suggesting abnormalities in cortical patterning. We further identify discrete modules of co-expressed genes associated with autism: a neuronal module enriched for known autism susceptibility genes, including the neuronal specific splicing factor A2BP1 (also known as FOX1), and a module enriched for immune genes and glial markers. Using high-throughput RNA sequencing we demonstrate dysregulated splicing of A2BP1-dependent alternative exons in the ASD brain. Moreover, using a published autism genome-wide association study (GWAS) data set, we show that the neuronal module is enriched for genetically associated variants, providing independent support for the causal involvement of these genes in autism. In contrast, the immune-glial module showed no enrichment for autism GWAS signals, indicating a non-genetic aetiology for this process. Collectively, our results provide strong evidence for convergent molecular abnormalities in ASD, and implicate transcriptional and splicing dysregulation as underlying mechanisms of neuronal dysfunction in this disorder.","[Voineagu, Irina; Lowe, Jennifer K.; Tian, Yuan; Geschwind, Daniel H.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Program Neurogenet & Neurobehav Genet, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Voineagu, Irina; Lowe, Jennifer K.; Tian, Yuan; Geschwind, Daniel H.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Semel Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Wang, Xinchen; Blencowe, Benjamin J.] Univ Toronto, Donnelly Ctr, Banting & Best Dept Med Res, Toronto, ON M5G 1L6, Canada; [Johnston, Patrick; Mill, Jonathan] Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat, London SE5 8AF, England; [Horvath, Steve; Cantor, Rita M.; Geschwind, Daniel H.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Human Genet, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Geschwind, DH (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Program Neurogenet & Neurobehav Genet, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",dhg@mednet.ucla.edu,"Mill, Jonathan/B-3276-2010","Mill, Jonathan/0000-0003-1115-3224","Canadian Institutes of Health Research; NIMH NIH HHS [5R01MH081754-03, R01 MH081754, R01 MH081754-01, R01 MH081754-02, R01 MH081754-03, R01 MH081754-04, R01 MH081754-05, R01 MH094714, R37 MH060233, R37 MH060233-11, R37 MH060233-12, R37MH060233]",,,37,642,652,12,131,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,16-Jun,2011,474,7351,,,,,380,+,,10.1038/nature10110,,2,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,777TD,WOS:000291647100046,21614001.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,daniel h.,geschwind,na,na,na,na,na

This has been attributed to the ability of live microorganisms to replicate and express specialized virulence factors that facilitate invasion and infection of their hosts(7). However, protective immunization can often be achieved with a single injection of live, but not dead, attenuated microorganisms stripped of their virulence factors. Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which are detected by the immune system(8,9), are present in both live and killed vaccines, indicating that certain poorly characterized aspects of live microorganisms, not incorporated in dead vaccines, are particularly effective at inducing protective immunity. Here we show that the mammalian innate immune system can directly sense microbial viability through detection of a special class of viability-associated PAMPs (vita-PAMPs). We identify prokaryotic messenger RNA as a vita-PAMP present only in viable bacteria, the recognition of which elicits a unique innate response and a robust adaptive antibody response. Notably, the innate response evoked by viability and prokaryotic mRNA was thus far considered to be reserved for pathogenic bacteria, but we show that even non-pathogenic bacteria in sterile tissues can trigger similar responses, provided that they are alive. Thus, the immune system actively gauges the infectious risk by searching PAMPs for signatures of microbial life and thus infectivity.

Here we present evidence that cell-lineage-specific factors, such as FoxA1, can simultaneously facilitate and restrict key regulated transcription factors, exemplified by the androgen receptor (AR), to act on structurally and functionally distinct classes of enhancer. Consequently, FoxA1 downregulation, an unfavourable prognostic sign in certain advanced prostate tumours, triggers dramatic reprogramming of the hormonal response by causing a massive switch in AR binding to a distinct cohort of pre-established enhancers. These enhancers are functional, as evidenced by the production of enhancer-templated non-coding RNA (eRNA(5)) based on global nuclear run-on sequencing (GRO-seq) analysis(6), with a unique class apparently requiring no nucleosome remodelling to induce specific enhancer-promoter looping and gene activation. GRO-seq data also suggest that liganded AR induces both transcription initiation and elongation. Together, these findings reveal a large repository of active enhancers that can be dynamically tuned to elicit alternative gene expression programs, which may underlie many sequential gene expression events in development, cell differentiation and disease progression.","[Wang, Dong; Benner, Chris; Qiu, Jinsong; Kaikkonen, Minna U.; Glass, Christopher K.; Fu, Xiang-Dong] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Dept Cellular & Mol Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Garcia-Bassets, Ivan; Li, Wenbo; Su, Xue; Liu, Wen; Ohgi, Kenneth A.; Rosenfeld, Michael G.] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Garcia-Bassets, Ivan] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Endocrinol & Metab, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Su, Xue; Liu, Wen] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Grad Program Biol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Zhou, Yiming] Digomics LLC, Malden, MA 02148 USA","Fu, XD (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Dept Cellular & Mol Med, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",ibassets@ucsd.edu; mrosenfeld@ucsd.edu; xdfu@ucsd.edu,"Wang, Dong/C-8775-2013; Qiu, Jinsong/K-2325-2013","Garcia-Bassets, Ivan/0000-0002-6941-9585; Glass, Christopher/0000-0003-4344-3592; Kaikkonen, Minna/0000-0001-6294-0979","Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NCI NIH HHS [R01 CA097134, R01 CA097134-10]; NHGRI NIH HHS [HG004659, R01 HG004659, R01 HG004659-03]; NHLBI NIH HHS [R01 HL065445, R01 HL065445-12]; NIDDK NIH HHS [R01 DK018477-35, DK01847, DK074868, DK37949, P01 DK074868, P01 DK074868-05, R01 DK018477, R01 DK039949, R01 DK039949-30, R01 DK091183, R37 DK039949, R37 DK039949-28]; NIGMS NIH HHS [GM049369, R01 GM049369, R01 GM049369-17]; NINDS NIH HHS [NS34934, R01 NS034934, R01 NS034934-23]",,,40,375,382,4,51,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,16-Jun,2011,474,7351,,,,,390,+,,10.1038/nature10006,,2,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,777TD,WOS:000291647100048,21572438.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,xiang-dong,fu,na,na,na,na,na

Here, we demonstrate that pseudouridylation (conversion of uridine into pseudouridine (Psi), ref. 4) of nonsense codons suppresses translation termination both in vitro and in vivo. In vivo targeting of nonsense codons is accomplished by the expression of an H/ACA RNA capable of directing the isomerization of uridine to Psi within the nonsense codon. Thus, targeted pseudouridylation represents a novel approach for promoting nonsense suppression in vivo. Remarkably, we also show that pseudouridylated nonsense codons code for amino acids with similar properties. Specifically, Psi AA and Psi AG code for serine and threonine, whereas Psi GA codes for tyrosine and phenylalanine, thus suggesting a new mode of decoding. Our results also suggest that RNA modification, as a naturally occurring mechanism, may offer a new way to expand the genetic code.","[Karijolich, John; Yu, Yi-Tao] Univ Rochester, Med Ctr, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Rochester, NY 14642 USA","Yu, YT (reprint author), Univ Rochester, Med Ctr, Dept Biochem & Biophys, 601 Elmwood Ave, Rochester, NY 14642 USA.",yitao_yu@urmc.rochester.edu,,,"NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM062937, R01 GM062937-09, R21 GM078223, R21 GM078223-02]",,,27,102,107,4,20,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,16-Jun,2011,474,7351,,,,,395,+,,10.1038/nature10165,,2,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,777TD,WOS:000291647100049,21677757.0,No,,,11/20/17,yi-tao,yu,na,na,na,na,na

Whether undifferentiated iPSCs themselves can be used to probe disease mechanisms is uncertain. Dyskeratosis congenita is characterized by defective maintenance of blood, pulmonary tissue and epidermal tissues and is caused by mutations in genes controlling telomere homeostasis(7,8). Short telomeres, a hallmark of dyskeratosis congenita, impair tissue stem cell function in mouse models, indicating that a tissue stem cell defect may underlie the pathophysiology of dyskeratosis congenita(9,10). Here we show that even in the undifferentiated state, iPSCs from dyskeratosis congenita patients harbour the precise biochemical defects characteristic of each form of the disease and that the magnitude of the telomere maintenance defect in iPSCs correlates with clinical severity. In iPSCs from patients with heterozygous mutations in TERT, the telomerase reverse transcriptase, a 50% reduction in telomerase levels blunts the natural telomere elongation that accompanies reprogramming. In contrast, mutation of dyskerin (DKC1) in X-linked dyskeratosis congenita severely impairs telomerase activity by blocking telomerase assembly and disrupts telomere elongation during reprogramming. In iPSCs from a form of dyskeratosis congenita caused by mutations in TCAB1 (also known as WRAP53), telomerase catalytic activity is unperturbed, yet the ability of telomerase to lengthen telomeres is abrogated, because telomerase mislocalizes from Cajal bodies to nucleoli within the iPSCs. Extended culture of DKC1-mutant iPSCs leads to progressive telomere shortening and eventual loss of self-renewal, indicating that a similar process occurs in tissue stem cells in dyskeratosis congenita patients. These findings in iPSCs from dyskeratosis congenita patients reveal that undifferentiated iPSCs accurately recapitulate features of a human stem cell disease and may serve as a cell-culture-based system for the development of targeted therapeutics.","[Batista, Luis F.

Despite being critical regulators of development, little is known about their post-translational regulation. Here we identify the ubiquitin ligase COP1 (also known as RFWD2) as a tumour suppressor that negatively regulates ETV1, ETV4 and ETV5. ETV1, which is mutated in prostate cancer more often, was degraded after being ubiquitinated by COP1. Truncated ETV1 encoded by prostate cancer translocation TMPRSS2:ETV1 lacks the critical COP1 binding motifs and was 50-fold more stable than wild-type ETV1. Almost all patient translocations render ETV1 insensitive to COP1, implying that this confers a selective advantage to prostate epithelial cells. Indeed, COP1 deficiency in mouse prostate elevated ETV1 and produced increased cell proliferation, hyperplasia, and early prostate intraepithelial neoplasia. Combined loss of COP1 and PTEN enhanced the invasiveness of mouse prostate adenocarcinomas. Finally, rare human prostate cancer samples showed hemizygous loss of the COP1 gene, loss of COP1 protein, and elevated ETV1 protein while lacking a translocation event. These findings identify COP1 as a tumour suppressor whose downregulation promotes prostatic epithelial cell proliferation and tumorigenesis.","[Vitari, Alberto C.; Newton, Kim; O'Rourke, Karen; Dixit, Vishva M.] Genentech Inc, Dept Physiol Chem, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Leong, Kevin G.] Genentech Inc, Dept Res Oncol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Yee, Cindy; Gao, Wei-Qiang] Genentech Inc, Dept Mol Biol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Liu, Jinfeng] Genentech Inc, Dept Bioinformat & Computat Biol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Phu, Lilian; Arnott, David] Genentech Inc, Dept Prot Chem, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Vij, Rajesh; Hongo, Jo-Anne] Genentech Inc, Dept Antibody Engn, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Ferrando, Ronald; Couto, Suzana S.; French, Dorothy M.] Genentech Inc, Dept Pathol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Mohan, Sankar; Pandita, Ajay] Genentech Inc, Dept Mol Diagnost & Canc Cell Biol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Wertz, Ingrid E.] Genentech Inc, Dept Early Discovery Biochem, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA","Dixit, VM (reprint author), Genentech Inc, Dept Physiol Chem, 1 DNA Way, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA.",dixit@gene.com,"dixit, vishva/A-4496-2012","dixit, vishva/0000-0001-6983-0326; Liu, Jinfeng/0000-0002-0343-8222",,,,44,77,79,1,10,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,16-Jun,2011,474,7351,,,,,403,+,,10.1038/nature10005,,2,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,777TD,WOS:000291647100051,21572435.0,No,,,11/20/17,vishva m.,dixit,na,na,na,na,na

The impressive navigational abilities of ants, bees, wasps and other insects demonstrate that insects are capable of visual place learning(1-4), but little is known about the underlying neural circuits that mediate these behaviours. Drosophila melanogaster (common fruit fly) is a powerful model organism for dissecting the neural circuitry underlying complex behaviours, from sensory perception to learning and memory. Drosophila can identify and remember visual features such as size, colour and contour orientation(5,6). However, the extent to which they use vision to recall specific locations remains unclear. Here we describe a visual place learning platform and demonstrate that Drosophila are capable of forming and retaining visual place memories to guide selective navigation. By targeted genetic silencing of small subsets of cells in the Drosophila brain, we show that neurons in the ellipsoid body, but not in the mushroom bodies, are necessary for visual place learning. Together, these studies reveal distinct neuroanatomical substrates for spatial versus non-spatial learning, and establish Drosophila as a powerful model for the study of spatial memories.

Abnormally high levels of cyclin D1 are detected in many human cancer types(2). To elucidate the molecular functions of cyclin D1 in human cancers, we performed a proteomic screen for cyclin D1 protein partners in several types of human tumours. Analyses of cyclin D1 interactors revealed a network of DNA repair proteins, including RAD51, a recombinase that drives the homologous recombination process(3). We found that cyclin D1 directly binds RAD51, and that cyclin D1-RAD51 interaction is induced by radiation. Like RAD51, cyclin D1 is recruited to DNA damage sites in a BRCA2-dependent fashion. Reduction of cyclin D1 levels in human cancer cells impaired recruitment of RAD51 to damaged DNA, impeded the homologous recombination-mediated DNA repair, and increased sensitivity of cells to radiation in vitro and in vivo. This effect was seen in cancer cells lacking the retinoblastoma protein, which do not require D-cyclins for proliferation(4,5). These findings reveal an unexpected function of a core cell cycle protein in DNA repair and suggest that targeting cyclin D1 may be beneficial also in retinoblastoma-negative cancers which are currently thought to be unaffected by cyclin D1 inhibition.","[Jirawatnotai, Siwanon; Hu, Yiduo; Michowski, Wojciech; Becks, Lisa; Bienvenu, Frederic; Zagozdzon, Agnieszka; van Harn, Tanja; Livingston, David M.; Sicinski, Piotr] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Biol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Jirawatnotai, Siwanon; Hu, Yiduo; Michowski, Wojciech; Becks, Lisa; Bienvenu, Frederic; Zagozdzon, Agnieszka; van Harn, Tanja; Livingston, David M.; Sicinski, Piotr] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Jirawatnotai, Siwanon] Mahidol Univ, Inst Mol Biosci, Salaya 73170, Nakhon Prathom, Thailand; [Elias, Joshua E.; Goswami, Tapasree; Gygi, Steven P.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Becks, Lisa] Massachusetts Coll Pharm & Hlth Sci, Dept Pharmacol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Wang, Yaoyu E.; Correll, Mick; Quackenbush, John] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Ctr Canc Computat Biol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Clark, Alan B.; Kunkel, Thomas A.] NIEHS, Mol Genet Lab, NIH, US Dept HHS, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Clark, Alan B.; Kunkel, Thomas A.] NIEHS, Struct Biol Lab, NIH, US Dept HHS, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Xia, Bing] Univ Med & Dent New Jersey, Robert Wood Johnson Med Sch, Canc Inst New Jersey, Dept Radiat Oncol, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USA; [Quackenbush, John] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Biostat & Computat Biol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Quackenbush, John] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Sicinski, P (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Biol, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",peter_sicinski@dfci.harvard.edu,,,"NIH [R01 CA083688, P01 CA080111, P01 CA109901]; Thailand Research Fund [MRG5280248]; Foundation for Polish Science; CCCB; Dana-Farber Strategic Plan Initiative; Division of Intramural Research of the NIH, NIEHS [Z01 ES065089]","We thank the members of the Sicinski lab for help and advice, N.

Here we report that alternative splicing of Saccharomyces cerevisiae SRC1 pre-mRNA is promoted by the conserved ubiquitin-like protein Hub1. Structural and biochemical data show that Hub1 binds non-covalently to a conserved element termed HIND, which is present in the spliceosomal protein Snu66 in yeast and mammals, and Prp38 in plants. Hub1 binding mildly alters spliceosomal protein interactions and barely affects general splicing in S. cerevisiae. However, spliceosomes that lack Hub1, or are defective in Hub1-HIND interaction, cannot use certain non-canonical 59 splice sites and are defective in alternative SRC1 splicing. Hub1 confers alternative splicing not only when bound to HIND, but also when experimentally fused to Snu66, Prp38, or even the core splicing factor Prp8. Our study indicates a novel mechanism for splice site utilization that is guided by non-covalent modification of the spliceosome by an unconventional ubiquitin-like modifier.","[Mishra, Shravan Kumar; Ammon, Tim; Jentsch, Stefan] Max Planck Inst Biochem, Dept Mol Cell Biol, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany; [Popowicz, Grzegorz M.; Krajewski, Marcin; Holak, Tad A.] Max Planck Inst Biochem, NMR Spect, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany; [Nagel, Roland J.; Ares, Manuel, Jr.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Mol Cell & Dev Biol, Ctr Mol Biol RNA, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA","Jentsch, S (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Biochem, Dept Mol Cell Biol, Klopferspitz 18, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany.",Jentsch@biochem.mpg.de,"Popowicz, Grzegorz/G-4769-2017","Popowicz, Grzegorz/0000-0003-2818-7498; Mishra, Shravan Kumar/0000-0003-3899-0495; Ares, Manny/0000-0002-2552-9168",Max Planck Society; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Fonds der chemischen Industrie; Center for Integrated Protein Science Munich; RUBICON EU Network of Excellence; NIH [GM040478],"We thank U.

By mechanotransduction systems, cells translate these stimuli into biochemical signals controlling multiple aspects of cell behaviour, including growth, differentiation and cancer malignant progression, but how rigidity mechanosensing is ultimately linked to activity of nuclear transcription factors remains poorly understood. Here we report the identification of the Yorkie-homologues YAP (Yes-associated protein) and TAZ (transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif, also known as WWTR1) as nuclear relays of mechanical signals exerted by ECM rigidity and cell shape. This regulation requires Rho GTPase activity and tension of the actomyosin cytoskeleton, but is independent of the Hippo/LATS cascade. Crucially, YAP/TAZ are functionally required for differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells induced by ECM stiffness and for survival of endothelial cells regulated by cell geometry; conversely, expression of activated YAP overrules physical constraints in dictating cell behaviour. These findings identify YAP/TAZ as sensors and mediators of mechanical cues instructed by the cellular microenvironment.","[Dupont, Sirio; Morsut, Leonardo; Aragona, Mariaceleste; Enzo, Elena; Cordenonsi, Michelangelo; Zanconato, Francesca; Piccolo, Stefano] Univ Padua, Sch Med, Dept Histol Microbiol & Med Biotechnol, I-35131 Padua, Italy; [Giulitti, Stefano; Elvassore, Nicola] Univ Padua, Dept Chem Engn DIPIC, I-35131 Padua, Italy; [Le Digabel, Jimmy] Univ Paris Diderot, Lab MSC, F-75205 Paris, France; [Le Digabel, Jimmy] CNRS, UMR 7057, F-75205 Paris, France; [Forcato, Mattia; Bicciato, Silvio] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Biomed Sci, Ctr Genome Res, I-41100 Modena, Italy","Dupont, S (reprint author), Univ Padua, Sch Med, Dept Histol Microbiol & Med Biotechnol, Viale Colombo 3, I-35131 Padua, Italy.",dupont@bio.unipd.it; piccolo@bio.unipd.it,"Bicciato, Silvio/C-9825-2009; Forcato, Mattia/B-7733-2015","Bicciato, Silvio/0000-0002-1944-7078; Forcato, Mattia/0000-0002-7383-6576; Dupont, Sirio/0000-0002-6869-1966",Telethon and Progetti di Eccellenza; AIRC (Italian Association for Cancer Research); University of Padua; IIT; Telethon; MIUR (Italian Minister of University),"We thank G.

Exactly how this happens has been unclear, because dissipation is needed to break magnetic field lines and classical collisions are typically weak. Ion-electron drag arising from turbulence(5), dubbed 'anomalous resistivity', and thermal momentum transport(6) are two mechanisms that have been widely invoked. Measurements of enhanced turbulence near reconnection sites in space(7,8) and in the laboratory(9,10) support the anomalous resistivity idea but there has been no demonstration from measurements that this turbulence produces the necessary enhanced drag(11). Here we report computer simulations that show that neither of the two previously favoured mechanisms controls how magnetic field lines reconnect in the plasmas of greatest interest, those in which the magnetic field dominates the energy budget. Rather, we find that when the current layers that form during magnetic reconnection become too intense, they disintegrate and spread into a complex web of filaments that causes the rate of reconnection to increase abruptly. This filamentary web can be explored in the laboratory or in space with satellites that can measure the resulting electromagnetic turbulence.","[Che, H.] Univ Colorado, Dept Phys, Ctr Integrated Plasma Studies, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Drake, J.

But despite its fundamental role, it is typically introduced as an abstract element of the theory with no explicit definition(1,2). Rather, physicists come to a working understanding of the wavefunction through its use to calculate measurement outcome probabilities by way of the Born rule(3). At present, the wavefunction is determined through tomographic methods(4-8), which estimate the wavefunction most consistent with a diverse collection of measurements. The indirectness of these methods compounds the problem of defining the wavefunction. Here we show that the wavefunction can be measured directly by the sequential measurement of two complementary variables of the system. The crux of our method is that the first measurement is performed in a gentle way through weak measurement(9-18), so as not to invalidate the second. The result is that the real and imaginary components of the wavefunction appear directly on our measurement apparatus. We give an experimental example by directly measuring the transverse spatial wavefunction of a single photon, a task not previously realized by any method. We show that the concept is universal, being applicable to other degrees of freedom of the photon, such as polarization or frequency, and to other quantum systems-for example, electron spins, SQUIDs (superconducting quantum interference devices) and trapped ions. Consequently, this method gives the wavefunction a straightforward and general definition in terms of a specific set of experimental operations(19). We expect it to expand the range of quantum systems that can be characterized and to initiate new avenues in fundamental quantum theory.","[Lundeen, Jeff S.; Sutherland, Brandon; Patel, Aabid; Stewart, Corey; Bamber, Charles] CNR, Inst Natl Measurement Stand, Ottawa, ON K1A 0R6, Canada","Lundeen, JS (reprint author), CNR, Inst Natl Measurement Stand, 1200 Montreal Rd, Ottawa, ON K1A 0R6, Canada.",jeff.lundeen@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca,"Lundeen, Jeff/E-8512-2012","Lundeen, Jeff/0000-0002-0978-2913",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council; Business Development Bank of Canada,This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council and the Business Development Bank of Canada.,,30,219,220,3,78,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,9-Jun,2011,474,7350,,,,,188,191,,10.1038/nature10120,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,774PE,WOS:000291397800044,21654800.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,charles,bamber,male,1,1798,g7ZQe7EAAAAJ,2171

It covers more than 70 per cent of the Earth's surface and strongly affects atmospheric, aerosol and environmental chemistry. The air-water interface has also attracted much interest as a model system that allows rigorous tests of theory, with one fundamental question being just how thin it is. Theoretical studies have suggested a surprisingly short 'healing length' of about 3 angstroms (1 angstrom = 0.1 nm), with the bulk-phase properties of water recovered within the top few monolayers(1-3). However, direct experimental evidence has been elusive owing to the difficulty of depth-profiling the liquid surface on the angstrom scale. Most physical, chemical and biological properties of water, such as viscosity, solvation, wetting and the hydrophobic effect, are determined by its hydrogen-bond network. This can be probed by observing the lineshape of the OH-stretch mode, the frequency shift of which is related to the hydrogen-bond strength(4-6). Here we report a combined experimental and theoretical study of the air-water interface using surface-selective heterodyne-detected vibrational sum frequency spectroscopy to focus on the 'free OD' transition found only in the topmost water layer. By using deuterated water and isotopic dilution to reveal the vibrational coupling mechanism, we find that the free OD stretch is affected only by intramolecular coupling to the stretching of the other OD group on the same molecule. The other OD stretch frequency indicates the strength of one of the first hydrogen bonds encountered at the surface; this is the donor hydrogen bond of the water molecule straddling the interface, which we find to be only slightly weaker than bulk-phase water hydrogen bonds. We infer from this observation a remarkably fast onset of bulk-phase behaviour on crossing from the air into the water phase.","[Stiopkin, Igor V.; Weeraman, Champika; Shalhout, Fadel Y.; Benderskii, Alexander V.] Wayne State Univ, Dept Chem, Detroit, MI 48202 USA; [Pieniazek, Piotr A.; Skinner, James L.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Chem, Madison, WI 53705 USA","Benderskii, AV (reprint author), Wayne State Univ, Dept Chem, Detroit, MI 48202 USA.",alex.benderskii@usc.edu,,,"NSF [CHE-0449720, CHE-0750307]; DOE [DE-FG02-09ER16110]","The experiments presented here were supported by the NSF CAREER grant number CHE-0449720 (I.V.S., C.W., F.Y.S. and A.V.B.).

Yet constraining their sensitivity to changes in climate(1) is important, as these glaciers are both sensitive indicators of climate change and serve as water reservoirs for highland regions(2). Studies have so far documented extra-tropical glacier fluctuations(3,4), but in the tropics, glacier-climate relationships are insufficiently understood. Here we present a (10)Be chronology for the past 11,000 years (11 kyr), using 57 moraines from the Bolivian Telata glacier (in the Cordillera Real mountain range). This chronology indicates that Telata glacier retreated irregularly. Arapid and strong melting from the maximum extent occurred from 10.8 +/- 0.9 to 8.5 +/- 0.4 kyr ago, followed by a slower retreat until the Little Ice Age, about 200 years ago. A dramatic increase in the rate of retreat occurred over the twentieth century. A glacier-climate model indicates that, relative to modern climate, annual mean temperature for the Telata glacier region was -3.3 +/- 0.8 degrees C cooler at 11 kyr ago and remained -2.1 +/- 0.8 degrees C cooler until the end of the Little Ice Age. We suggest that long-term warming of the eastern tropical Pacific and increased atmospheric temperature in response to enhanced austral summer insolation were the main drivers for the long-term Holocene retreat of glaciers in the southern tropics.","[Jomelli, Vincent; Brunstein, Daniel; Grancher, Delphine] Univ Paris 01, CNRS, Lab Geog Phys, F-92195 Meudon, France; [Khodri, Myriam] IRD, IPSL, LOCEAN, F-75252 Paris 05, France; [Favier, Vincent] UJF, CNRS, LGGE, F-38402 St Martin Dheres, France; [Ledru, Marie-Pierre] UM2 CNRS IRD, ISEM, IRD UMR 226, F-34095 Montpellier, France; [Wagnon, Patrick; Sicart, Jean-Emmanuel] UJF Grenoble 1, CNRS, UMR 5183, IRD,G INP,LGGE,LTHE,UMR 5564, F-38402 Grenoble, France; [Blard, Pierre-Henri] Univ Lorraine, CNRS, UPR2300, CRPG, F-54501 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France; [Braucher, Regis; Bourles, Didier Louis] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, UMR 6635, CEREGE, F-13545 Aix En Provence, France; [Braconnot, Pascale] CEA Saclay, UVSQ, CNRS, CEA,Unite Mixte,Lab Sci Climat & Environm,IPSL, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Vuille, Mathias] SUNY Albany, Dept Atmospher & Environm Sci, Albany, NY 12222 USA","Jomelli, V (reprint author), Univ Paris 01, CNRS, Lab Geog Phys, F-92195 Meudon, France.",jomelli@cnrs-bellevue.fr,"Khodri, Myriam/K-1399-2016; Regis, Braucher/Q-5971-2017; Favier, Vincent/T-1936-2017","Khodri, Myriam/0000-0003-1941-1646; Regis, Braucher/0000-0002-4637-4302; Favier, Vincent/0000-0001-6024-9498; Vuille, Mathias/0000-0002-9736-4518; Bourles, Didier/0000-0001-5991-6126; Ledru, Marie-Pierre/0000-0002-8079-9320; brunstein, daniel/0000-0001-5496-8349","French INSU; French ANR [06-Vuln-010, 10-Blan-608-01]; INSU/CNRS; French Ministry of Research and Higher Education; IRD and CEA; CNRS; EU [EVK2-CT-2002-00153]; Programme National d'Etude de la Dynamique du Climate (PNEDC)","Financial support was provided by the French INSU programme 'LEVE', the French ANR Escarcel programme no. 06-Vuln-010, UR Great Ice at IRD, and the French ANR El Paso programme no. 10-Blan-608-01.

However, our current understanding of fungal evolutionary diversity is incomplete(4) and is based upon species amenable to growth in culture(1). These culturable fungi are typically yeast or filamentous forms, bound by a rigid cell wall rich in chitin. Evolution of this body plan was thought critical for the success of the Fungi, enabling them to adapt to heterogeneous habitats and live by osmotrophy: extracellular digestion followed by nutrient uptake(5). Here we investigate the ecology and cell biology of a previously undescribed and highly diverse form of eukaryotic life that branches with the Fungi, using environmental DNA analyses combined with fluorescent detection via DNA probes. This clade is present in numerous ecosystems including soil, freshwater and aquatic sediments. Phylogenetic analyses using multiple ribosomal RNA genes place this clade with Rozella, the putative primary branch of the fungal kingdom(1). Tyramide signal amplification coupled with group-specific fluorescence in situ hybridization reveals that the target cells are small eukaryotes of 3-5 mm in length, capable of forming a microtubule-based flagellum. Co-staining with cell wall markers demonstrates that representatives from the clade do not produce a chitin-rich cell wall during any of the life cycle stages observed and therefore do not conform to the standard fungal body plan(5). We name this highly diverse clade the cryptomycota in anticipation of formal classification.","[Jones, Meredith D.

Antiviral treatment is only partially effective and a vaccine does not exist. Development of more effective therapies has been hampered by the lack of a suitable small animal model. Although xenotransplantation of immunodeficient mice with human hepatocytes has shown promise, these models are subject to important challenges. Building on the previous observation that CD81 and occludin comprise the minimal human factors required to render mouse cells permissive to HCV entry in vitro(4), we attempted murine humanization via a genetic approach. Here we show that expression of two human genes is sufficient to allow HCV infection of fully immunocompetent inbred mice. We establish a precedent for applying mouse genetics to dissect viral entry and validate the role of scavenger receptor type B class I for HCV uptake. We demonstrate that HCV can be blocked by passive immunization, as well as showing that a recombinant vaccinia virus vector induces humoral immunity and confers partial protection against heterologous challenge. This system recapitulates a portion of the HCV life cycle in an immunocompetent rodent for the first time, opening opportunities for studying viral pathogenesis and immunity and comprising an effective platform for testing HCV entry inhibitors in vivo.","[Dorner, Marcus; Horwitz, Joshua A.; Barry, Walter T.; Feng, Qian; Mu, Kathy; Jones, Christopher T.; Schoggins, John W.; Catanese, Maria Teresa; Rice, Charles M.; Ploss, Alexander] Rockefeller Univ, Ctr Study Hepatitis C, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Robbins, Justin B.; Burton, Dennis R.; Law, Mansun] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Immunol & Microbial Sci, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Burton, Dennis R.] Scripps Res Inst, IAVI Neutralizing Antibody Ctr, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Burton, Dennis R.] Ragon Inst MGH MIT & Harvard, Boston, MA 02129 USA","Ploss, A (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Ctr Study Hepatitis C, 1230 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA.",aploss@rockefeller.edu,,"Dorner, Marcus/0000-0001-7936-1527; Dorner, Marcus/0000-0003-0321-4226","National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases [RC1DK087193]; National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease [R01AI072613, R01AI079031, R01AI071084]; Starr Foundation; Greenberg Medical Institute; German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgesellschaft); Rockefeller University; National Institute of Health [F32DK082155, F32DK081193]","We thank J.

Whereas it has been generally assumed that these autologous cells should be immune-tolerated by the recipient from whom the iPSCs are derived, their immunogenicity has not been vigorously examined. We show here that, whereas embryonic stem cells (ESCs) derived from inbred C57BL/6 (B6) mice can efficiently form teratomas in B6 mice without any evident immune rejection, the allogeneic ESCs from 129/SvJ mice fail to form teratomas in B6 mice due to rapid rejection by recipients. B6 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were reprogrammed into iPSCs by either retroviral approach (ViPSCs) or a novel episomal approach (EiPSCs) that causes no genomic integration. In contrast to B6 ESCs, teratomas formed by B6 ViPSCs were mostly immune-rejected by B6 recipients. In addition, the majority of teratomas formed by B6 EiPSCs were immunogenic in B6 mice with T cell infiltration, and apparent tissue damage and regression were observed in a small fraction of teratomas. Global gene expression analysis of teratomas formed by B6 ESCs and EiPSCs revealed a number of genes frequently over-expressed in teratomas derived from EiPSCs, and several such gene products were shown to contribute directly to the immunogenicity of the B6 EiPSC-derived cells in B6 mice. These findings indicate that, in contrast to derivatives of ESCs, abnormal gene expression in some cells differentiated from iPSCs can induce T-cell-dependent immune response in syngeneic recipients. Therefore, the immunogenicity of therapeutically valuable cells derived from patient-specific iPSCs should be evaluated before any clinical application of these autologous cells into the patients.","[Zhao, Tongbiao; Zhang, Zhen-Ning; Rong, Zhili; Xu, Yang] Univ Calif San Diego, Div Biol Sci, Mol Biol Sect, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Xu, Y (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Div Biol Sci, Mol Biol Sect, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",yangxu@ucsd.edu,"liang, yan/H-3894-2011; Rong, Zhili/H-7561-2014; Zhao, Tongbiao/C-5761-2011","Rong, Zhili/0000-0002-1699-7074; Zhao, Tongbiao/0000-0003-1429-5818",NIH; California Institute for Regenerative Medicine [ET-01277],"We thank M.

The niche may also protect stem cells from environmental insults(3) including cytotoxic chemotherapy and perhaps pathogenic immunity(4). The testis, hair follicle and placenta are all sites of residence for stem cells and are immune-suppressive environments, called immune-privileged sites, where multiple mechanisms cooperate to prevent immune attack, even enabling prolonged survival of foreign allografts without immunosuppression(4). We sought to determine if somatic stem-cell niches more broadly are immune-privileged sites by examining the haematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) niche(1,2,5-7) in the bone marrow, a site where immune reactivity exists(8,9). We observed persistence of HSPCs from allogeneic donor mice (allo-HSPCs) in non-irradiated recipient mice for 30 days without immunosuppression with the same survival frequency compared to syngeneic HSPCs. These HSPCs were lost after the depletion of FoxP3 regulatory T (T-reg) cells. High-resolutionin vivo imaging over time demonstrated marked co-localization of HSPCs with T-reg cells that accumulated on the endosteal surface in the calvarial and trabecular bone marrow. T-reg cells seem to participate in creating a localized zone where HSPCs reside and where T-reg cells are necessary for allo-HSPC persistence. In addition to processes supporting stem-cell function, the niche will provide a relative sanctuary from immune attack.","[Fujisaki, Joji; Wu, Juwell; Carlson, Alicia L.; Lin, Charles P.] Harvard Univ, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Sch Med, Ctr Syst Biol,Adv Microscopy Program, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Fujisaki, Joji; Wu, Juwell; Carlson, Alicia L.; Lin, Charles P.] Harvard Univ, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Sch Med, Wellman Ctr Photomed, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Fujisaki, Joji; Wu, Juwell; Silberstein, Lev; Lo Celso, Cristina; Scadden, David T.; Lin, Charles P.] Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Wu, Juwell] Harvard Mit Div Hlth Sci & Technol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Silberstein, Lev; Scadden, David T.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Regenerat Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Putheti, Prabhakar; Larocca, Rafael; Gao, Wenda; Strom, Terry B.] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Inst Transplantat, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Putheti, Prabhakar; Larocca, Rafael; Gao, Wenda; Strom, Terry B.] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Saito, Toshiki I.; Sykes, Megan] Massachusetts Gen Hosp E, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Transplantat Biol Res Ctr, Bone Marrow Transplantat Sect, Boston, MA 02129 USA; [Tsuyuzaki, Hitoshi; Sato, Tatsuyuki] Univ Tokyo, Fac Med, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Cote, Daniel] Dept Phys Genie Phys & Opt, Quebec City, PQ G1J 2G3, Canada; [Cote, Daniel] Univ Laval Robert Giffard, Ctr Rech, Quebec City, PQ G1J 2G3, Canada","Fujisaki, J (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Sch Med, Ctr Syst Biol,Adv Microscopy Program, CPZN 8238,185 Cambridge St, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",jfujisaki@partners.org; lin@helix.mgh.harvard.edu,"Cote, Daniel/D-5185-2011; Larocca, Rafael/J-9557-2012; Assumpcao Larocca, Rafael/H-1655-2015","Assumpcao Larocca, Rafael/0000-0002-9995-1804; Lo Celso, Cristina/0000-0002-1163-4207","Bullock fellowship; Harvard Stem Cell Institute; DoD [W81XWH-10-1-0217]; NIH [HL097748, HL97794, CA111519, AI041521]; EMBO; HFSP; philanthropic sources","This work was supported by Bullock fellowship (to J.F.), the Harvard Stem Cell Institute and DoD W81XWH-10-1-0217 (to J.F. and C.P.L.), NIH HL097748 (to C.P.L.), HL97794 (to D.T.S.), CA111519 (to M.S.), AI041521 (to T.B.S), EMBO (to C.L.C.), HFSP (to C.L.C.), philanthropic sources (to D.T.S. and C.L.C.), and the National Institutes of Health.

HSCs are used clinically to treat a wide array of diseases, including acute leukaemias and congenital blood disorders, but obtaining suitable numbers of cells and finding immune-compatible donors remain serious problems. These difficulties have led to an interest in the conversion of embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells into HSCs, which is not possible using current methodologies. To accomplish this goal, it is critical to understand the native mechanisms involved in the specification of HSCs during embryonic development. Here we demonstrate in zebrafish that Wnt16 controls a novel genetic regulatory network required for HSC specification. Non-canonical signalling by Wnt16 is required for somitic expression of the Notch ligands deltaC (dlc) and deltaD (dld), and these ligands are, in turn, required for the establishment of definitive haematopoiesis. Notch signalling downstream of Dlc and Dld is earlier than, and distinct from, known cell-autonomous requirements for Notch, strongly suggesting that novel Notch-dependent relay signal(s) induce the first HSCs in parallel to other established pathways. Our results demonstrate that somite-specific gene expression is required for the production of haemogenic endothelium.","[Clements, Wilson K.; Kim, Albert D.; Ong, Karen G.; Traver, David] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Cellular & Mol Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Clements, Wilson K.; Kim, Albert D.; Ong, Karen G.; Traver, David] Univ Calif San Diego, Sect Cell & Dev Biol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Moore, John C.; Lawson, Nathan D.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Program Gene Funct & Express, Worcester, MA 01605 USA","Traver, D (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Cellular & Mol Med, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",dtraver@ucsd.edu,"Clements, Wilson/D-4153-2011; Clements, Wilson/C-9617-2015","Clements, Wilson/0000-0003-4365-9553","AHA [0725086Y, 0815732D]; NIH [R01-HL093467, R01-DK074482]; CIRM; March of Dimes [6-FY09-508]","The authors wish to thank L.

However, the conversion to iPSCs is inefficient. The protooncogene Myc enhances the efficiency of iPSC generation by OSK but it also increases the tumorigenicity of the resulting iPSCs(2). Here we show that the Gli-like transcription factor Glis1 (Glis family zinc finger 1) markedly enhances the generation of iPSCs from both mouse and human fibroblasts when it is expressed together with OSK. Mouse iPSCs generated using this combination of transcription factors can form germline-competent chimaeras. Glis1 is enriched in unfertilized oocytes and in embryos at the one-cell stage. DNA microarray analyses show that Glis1 promotes multiple pro-reprogramming pathways, including Myc, Nanog, Lin28, Wnt, Essrb and the mesenchymal-epithelial transition. These results therefore show that Glis1 effectively promotes the direct reprogramming of somatic cells during iPSC generation.","[Maekawa, Momoko; Nakamura, Tomonori; Shibukawa, Ran; Kodanaka, Ikumi; Ichisaka, Tomoko; Yamanaka, Shinya] Kyoto Univ, Ctr iPS Cell Res & Applicat CiRA, Kyoto 6068507, Japan; [Maekawa, Momoko; Shibukawa, Ran; Kodanaka, Ikumi; Yamanaka, Shinya] JST, Yamanaka iPS Cell Special Project, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; [Yamaguchi, Kei; Kawamura, Yoshifumi; Mochizuki, Hiromi] Japan Biol Informat Consortium, Tokyo 1350064, Japan; [Nakamura, Tomonori; Ichisaka, Tomoko; Yamanaka, Shinya] Kyoto Univ, Inst Integrated Cell Mat Sci, Kyoto 6068507, Japan; [Goshima, Naoki] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Biomed Informat Res Ctr, Tokyo 1350064, Japan; [Yamanaka, Shinya] Gladstone Inst Cardiovasc Dis, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA","Yamanaka, S (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Ctr iPS Cell Res & Applicat CiRA, Kyoto 6068507, Japan.",n-goshima@aist.go.jp; yamanaka@cira.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,"Nakamura, Tomonori/0000-0002-0173-0780","New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT); Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS); Program for Promotion of Fundamental Studies in Health Sciences of the National Institute of Biomedical Innovation (NIBIO)","We thank T.

The role of SecDF has remained unclear, although it is proposed to function in later stages of translocation as well as in membrane protein biogenesis(4,10-13). Here, we determined the crystal structure of Thermus thermophilus SecDF at 3.3 angstrom resolution, revealing a pseudo-symmetrical, 12-helix transmembrane domain belonging to the RND superfamily and two major periplasmic domains, P1 and P4. Higher-resolution analysis of the periplasmic domains suggested that P1, which binds an unfolded protein, undergoes functionally important conformational changes. In vitro analyses identified an ATP-independent step of protein translocation that requires both SecDF and proton motive force. Electrophysiological analyses revealed that SecDF conducts protons in a manner dependent on pH and the presence of an unfolded protein, with conserved Asp and Arg residues at the transmembrane interface between SecD and SecF playing essential roles in the movements of protons and preproteins. Therefore, we propose that SecDF functions as a membrane-integrated chaperone, powered by proton motive force, to achieve ATP-independent protein translocation.","[Tsukazaki, Tomoya; Echizen, Yuka; Ishitani, Ryuichiro; Nureki, Osamu] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biophys & Biochem, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130032, Japan; [Mori, Hiroyuki] Kyoto Univ, Inst Virus Res, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068507, Japan; [Fukai, Shuya] Univ Tokyo, Synchrotron Radiat Res Org, Div Life Sci, Struct Biol Lab, Tokyo 1130032, Japan; [Fukai, Shuya] Univ Tokyo, Ctr Struct Biol Challenging Prot, Lab Macromol Complexes, Tokyo 1130032, Japan; [Tanaka, Takeshi; Kohno, Toshiyuki] Mitsubishi Kagaku Inst Life Sci, Machida, Tokyo 1948511, Japan; [Perederina, Anna; Vassylyev, Dmitry G.] Univ Alabama, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Genet, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; [Perederina, Anna; Vassylyev, Dmitry G.] Univ Alabama, Sch Dent, Dept Biochem & Mol Genet, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; [Maturana, Andres D.] Nagaoka Univ Technol, Dept Bioengn, Niigata 9402188, Japan; [Ito, Koreaki] Kyoto Sangyo Univ, Kita Ku, Kyoto 6038555, Japan","Nureki, O (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biophys & Biochem, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130032, Japan.",kito@cc.kyoto-su.ac.jp; nureki@ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT); JST; NIH","We thank Y.

Cryptic variation has no effect on phenotypes in a given genetic or environmental background, but it can have effects after mutations or environmental change(2-5). Because evolutionary adaptation by natural selection requires phenotypic variation, phenotypically revealed cryptic genetic variation may facilitate evolutionary adaptation(6-8). This is possible if the cryptic variation happens to be pre-adapted, or ""exapted""(9), to a new environment, and is thus advantageous once revealed. However, this facilitating role for cryptic variation has not been proven, partly because most pertinent work focuses on complex phenotypes of whole organisms whose genetic basis is incompletely understood. Here we show that populations of RNA enzymes with accumulated cryptic variation adapt more rapidly to a new substrate than a population without cryptic variation. A detailed analysis of our evolving RNA populations in genotype space shows that cryptic variation allows a population to explore new genotypes that become adaptive only in a new environment. Our observations show that cryptic variation contains new genotypes pre-adapted to a changed environment. Our results highlight the positive role that robustness and epistasis can have in adaptive evolution(10,11).","[Hayden, Eric J.; Ferrada, Evandro; Wagner, Andreas] Univ Zurich, Inst Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Hayden, Eric J.; Ferrada, Evandro; Wagner, Andreas] Swiss Inst Bioinformat, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Wagner, Andreas] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA","Wagner, A (reprint author), Univ Zurich, Inst Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",andreas.wagner@ieu.uzh.ch,,,"Swiss National Science Foundation [315200-116814, 315200-119697, 315230-129708]; SystemsX.ch; University of Zurich","We thank R.

During pilus assembly, subunits dock as chaperone-bound complexes to an usher, which catalyses their polymerization and mediates pilus translocation across the outer membrane. Here we report the crystal structure of the full-length FimD usher bound to the FimC-FimH chaperone-adhesin complex and that of the unbound form of the FimD translocation domain. The FimD-FimC-FimH structure shows FimH inserted inside the FimD 24-stranded beta-barrel translocation channel. FimC-FimH is held in place through interactions with the two carboxy-terminal periplasmic domains of FimD, a binding mode confirmed in solution by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. To accommodate FimH, the usher plug domain is displaced from the barrel lumen to the periplasm, concomitant with a marked conformational change in the beta-barrel. The amino-terminal domain of FimD is observed in an ideal position to catalyse incorporation of a newly recruited chaperone-subunit complex. The FimD-FimC-FimH structure provides unique insights into the pilus subunit incorporation cycle, and captures the first view of a protein transporter in the act of secreting its cognate substrate.","[Phan, Gilles; Remaut, Han; Allen, William J.; Pirker, Katharina F.; Geibel, Sebastian; Yan, Jun; Kunze, Micha B.

Neurotransmitter binding triggers a conformational change in the receptor, opening an intrinsic chloride channel and thereby dampening neuronal excitability. Here we present the first three-dimensional structure, to our knowledge, of an inhibitory anion-selective Cys-loop receptor, the homopentameric Caenorhabditis elegans glutamate-gated chloride channel alpha (GluCl), at 3.3 angstrom resolution. The X-ray structure of the GluCl-Fab complex was determined with the allosteric agonist ivermectin and in additional structures with the endogenous neurotransmitter L-glutamate and the open-channel blocker picrotoxin. Ivermectin, used to treat river blindness, binds in the transmembrane domain of the receptor and stabilizes an open-pore conformation. Glutamate binds in the classical agonist site at subunit interfaces, and picrotoxin directly occludes the pore near its cytosolic base. GluCl provides a framework for understanding mechanisms of fast inhibitory neurotransmission and allosteric modulation of Cys-loop receptors.","[Hibbs, Ryan E.; Gouaux, Eric] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Vollum Inst, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Gouaux, Eric] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Portland, OR 97239 USA","Gouaux, E (reprint author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Vollum Inst, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Pk Rd, Portland, OR 97239 USA.",gouauxe@ohsu.edu,,,NIH [F32NS061404],"We are grateful to H.

In principle, reversible operations may be performed at no energy cost; given that irreversible computations can always be decomposed into reversible operations followed by the erasure of data(1,2), the problem of calculating their energy cost is reduced to the study of erasure. Landauer's principle states that the erasure of data stored in a system has an inherent work cost and therefore dissipates heat(3-8). However, this consideration assumes that the information about the system to be erased is classical, and does not extend to the general case where an observer may have quantum information about the system to be erased, for instance by means of a quantum memory entangled with the system. Here we show that the standard formulation and implications of Landauer's principle are no longer valid in the presence of quantum information. Our main result is that the work cost of erasure is determined by the entropy of the system, conditioned on the quantum information an observer has about it. In other words, the more an observer knows about the system, the less it costs to erase it. This result gives a direct thermodynamic significance to conditional entropies, originally introduced in information theory. Furthermore, it provides new bounds on the heat generation of computations: because conditional entropies can become negative in the quantum case, an observer who is strongly correlated with a system may gain work while erasing it, thereby cooling the environment.","[del Rio, Lidia; Aberg, Johan; Renner, Renato; Dahlsten, Oscar] ETH, Inst Theoret Phys, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Dahlsten, Oscar; Vedral, Vlatko] Univ Oxford, Clarendon Lab, Oxford OX1 3PU, England; [Dahlsten, Oscar; Vedral, Vlatko] Natl Univ Singapore, Ctr Quantum Technol, Singapore 117543, Singapore; [Vedral, Vlatko] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Phys, Singapore 117542, Singapore","del Rio, L (reprint author), ETH, Inst Theoret Phys, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",delrio@phys.ethz.ch,"vedral, vlatko/P-1712-2014; Vedral, Vlatko/L-3270-2016","Vedral, Vlatko/0000-0002-8588-2940; del Rio, Lidia/0000-0002-2445-2701",Swiss National Science Foundation [200021-119868]; Portuguese Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia [SFRH/BD/43263/2008]; European Research Council [258932]; Singapore's National Research Foundation and Ministry of Education,"We thank R.

Semiconductor modulators have therefore been heavily researched over the past few years. However, the device footprint of silicon-based modulators is of the order of millimetres, owing to its weak electro-optical properties(3). Germanium and compound semiconductors, on the other hand, face the major challenge of integration with existing silicon electronics and photonics platforms(4-6). Integrating silicon modulators with high-quality-factor optical resonators increases the modulation strength, but these devices suffer from intrinsic narrow bandwidth and require sophisticated optical design; they also have stringent fabrication requirements and limited temperature tolerances(7). Finding a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible material with adequate modulation speed and strength has therefore become a task of not only scientific interest, but also industrial importance. Here we experimentally demonstrate a broadband, high-speed, waveguide-integrated electroabsorption modulator based on monolayer graphene. By electrically tuning the Fermi level of the graphene sheet, we demonstrate modulation of the guided light at frequencies over 1 GHz, together with a broad operation spectrum that ranges from 1.35 to 1.6 mm under ambient conditions. The high modulation efficiency of graphene results in an active device area of merely 25 mu m(2), which is among the smallest to date. This graphene-based optical modulation mechanism, with combined advantages of compact footprint, low operation voltage and ultrafast modulation speed across a broad range of wavelengths, can enable novel architectures for on-chip optical communications.","[Liu, Ming; Yin, Xiaobo; Ulin-Avila, Erick; Zentgraf, Thomas; Zhang, Xiang] Univ Calif Berkeley, NSF Nanoscale Sci & Engn Ctr NSEC, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Geng, Baisong; Ju, Long; Wang, Feng] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Wang, Feng; Zhang, Xiang] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Zhang, X (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, NSF Nanoscale Sci & Engn Ctr NSEC, 3112 Etcheverry Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",fengwang76@berkeley.edu; xiang@berkeley.edu,"Yin, Xiaobo/A-4142-2011; Zentgraf, Thomas/G-8848-2013; ulin-avila, erick/M-3278-2014; wang, Feng/I-5727-2015","Zentgraf, Thomas/0000-0002-8662-1101; ","National Science Foundation Nano-scale Science and Engineering Center (NSF-NSEC) for Scalable and Integrated Nano Manufacturing (SINAM) [CMMI-0751621]; US Department of Energy, Basic Energy Sciences Energy Frontier Research Center (DoE-LMI-EFRC) [DOE DE-AC02-05CH11231]","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation Nano-scale Science and Engineering Center (NSF-NSEC) for Scalable and Integrated Nano Manufacturing (SINAM) (grant no.

Such methane release is a hypothesized cause or amplifier for one of the most drastic global warming events in Earth history, the end of the Marinoan 'snowball Earth' ice age, similar to 635 Myr ago(4-7). A key piece of evidence supporting this hypothesis is the occurrence of exceptionally depleted carbon isotope signatures (delta(13)C(PDB) down to -48 parts per thousand; ref. 8) in post-glacial cap dolostones (that is, dolostone overlying glacial deposits) from south China; these signatures have been interpreted as products of methane oxidation at the time of deposition(5,6,8). Here we show, on the basis of carbonate clumped isotope thermometry, (87)Sr/(86)Sr isotope ratios, trace element content and clay mineral evidence, that carbonates bearing the (13)C-depleted signatures crystallized more than 1.6 Myr after deposition of the cap dolostone. Our results indicate that highly (13)C-depleted carbonate cements grew from hydrothermal fluids and suggest that their carbon isotope signatures are a consequence of thermogenic methane oxidation at depth. This finding not only negates carbon isotope evidence for methane release during Marinoan deglaciation in south China, but also eliminates the only known occurrence of a Precambrian sedimentary carbonate with highly (13)C-depleted signatures related to methane oxidation in a seep environment. We propose that the capacity to form highly (13)C-depleted seep carbonates, through biogenic anaeorobic oxidation of methane using sulphate, was limited in the Precambrian period by low sulphate concentrations in sea water(9). As a consequence, although clathrate destabilization may or may not have had a role in the exit from the 'snowball' state, it would not have left extreme carbon isotope signals in cap dolostones.","[Bristow, Thomas F.; Bonifacie, Magali; Eiler, John M.; Grotzinger, John P.] CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Bonifacie, Magali] Univ Paris Diderot, Equipe Geochim Isotopes Stables, Inst Phys Globe Paris, CNRS,UMR 7154, F-75005 Paris, France; [Derkowski, Arkadiusz] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Geol Sci, PL-31002 Krakow, Poland","Bristow, TF (reprint author), NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA.",thomas.f.bristow@nasa.gov,"Bonifacie, Magali/A-5656-2011",,O.K.

In the subsequent 20 million years, at a time of declining atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations(2) and an evolving Antarctic circumpolar current(2), sedimentary sequence interpretation(3) and numerical modelling(4) suggest that cyclical periods of ice-sheet expansion to the continental margin, followed by retreat to the subglacial highlands, occurred up to thirty times. These fluctuations were paced by orbital changes and were a major influence on global sea levels(5). Ice-sheet models show that the nature of such oscillations is critically dependent on the pattern and extent of Antarctic topographic lowlands. Here we show that the basal topography of the Aurora Subglacial Basin of East Antarctica, at present overlain by 2-4.5 km of ice, is characterized by a series of well-defined topographic channels within a mountain block landscape. The identification of this fjord landscape, based on new data from ice-penetrating radar, provides an improved understanding of the topography of the Aurora Subglacial Basin and its surroundings, and reveals a complex surface sculpted by a succession of ice-sheet configurations substantially different from today's. At different stages during its fluctuations, the edge of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet lay pinned along the margins of the Aurora Subglacial Basin, the upland boundaries of which are currently above sea level and the deepest parts of which are more than 1 km below sea level. Although the timing of the channel incision remains uncertain, our results suggest that the fjord landscape was carved by at least two ice-flow regimes of different scales and directions, each of which would have over-deepened existing topographic depressions, reversing valley floor slopes.","[Young, Duncan A.; Greenbaum, Jamin S.; Schroeder, Dustin M.; Holt, John W.; Blankenship, Donald D.] Univ Texas Austin, Inst Geophys, Jackson Sch Geosci, Austin, TX 78758 USA; [Wright, Andrew P.; Sugden, David E.; Siegert, Martin J.] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH9 3JW, Midlothian, Scotland; [Roberts, Jason L.; Warner, Roland C.; Young, Neal W.; van Ommen, Tas D.] Australian Antarctic Div, Kingston, Tas 7050, Australia; [Roberts, Jason L.; Warner, Roland C.; Young, Neal W.; van Ommen, Tas D.] Antarctic Climate & Ecosyst Cooperat Res Ctr, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia","Young, DA (reprint author), Univ Texas Austin, Inst Geophys, Jackson Sch Geosci, Austin, TX 78758 USA.",duncan@utig.ig.utexas.edu; m.j.siegert@ed.ac.uk,"Siegert, Martin/A-3826-2008; Roberts, Jason/B-2235-2012; Holt, John/C-4896-2009; van Ommen, Tas/B-5020-2012; Young, Duncan/G-6256-2010","Siegert, Martin/0000-0002-0090-4806; van Ommen, Tas/0000-0002-2463-1718; Young, Duncan/0000-0002-6866-8176; Schroeder, Dustin/0000-0003-1916-3929; Roberts, Jason/0000-0002-3477-4069",NSF [ANT-0733025]; NASA [NNX09AR52G]; NERC [NE/D003733/1]; Australian Antarctic Division [3103]; Jackson School of Geoscience; Jet Propulsion Laboratory; G.

However, the highly uncertain nature of such reconstructions limits our understanding of early hominin ecology, biology, social structure and evolution. We investigated landscape use in Australopithecus africanus and Paranthropus robustus from the Sterkfontein and Swartkrans cave sites in South Africa using strontium isotope analysis, a method that can help to identify the geological substrate on which an animal lived during tooth mineralization. Here we show that a higher proportion of small hominins than large hominins had non-local strontium isotope compositions. Given the relatively high levels of sexual dimorphism in early hominins, the smaller teeth are likely to represent female individuals, thus indicating that females were more likely than males to disperse from their natal groups. This is similar to the dispersal pattern found in chimpanzees(9), bonobos(10) and many human groups(11), but dissimilar from that of most gorillas and other primates(12). The small proportion of demonstrably non-local large hominin individuals could indicate that male australopiths had relatively small home ranges, or that they preferred dolomitic landscapes.","[Copeland, Sandi R.; Grimes, Vaughan; Richards, Michael P.] Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Anthropol, Dept Human Evolut, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Copeland, Sandi R.; Sponheimer, Matt] Univ Colorado, Dept Anthropol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [de Ruiter, Darryl J.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Anthropol, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Lee-Thorp, Julia A.] Univ Oxford, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Lee-Thorp, Julia A.; le Roux, Petrus J.] Univ Cape Town, Dept Geol Sci, AEON EarthLAB, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Codron, Daryl] Univ Zurich, Vetsuisse Fac, Clin Zoo Anim Exot Pets & Wildlife, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Grimes, Vaughan] Mem Univ, Dept Archaeol, St John, NF A1C 5S7, Canada; [Richards, Michael P.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Anthropol, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada","Copeland, SR (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Anthropol, Dept Human Evolut, Deutsch Pl 6, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.",sandi.copeland@colorado.edu,"Codron, Daryl/B-8867-2008; Sponheimer, Matt/A-6075-2013; Richards, Michael/A-9374-2008","Codron, Daryl/0000-0001-5223-9513; Sponheimer, Matt/0000-0002-8743-1123; Richards, Michael/0000-0001-5274-8887; le Roux, Petrus/0000-0002-5930-4995","National Science Foundation, USA [0609963]; Max Planck Society; University of Colorado","Funding for this project was provided by the National Science Foundation, USA (grant 0609963), the Max Planck Society, a University of Colorado LEAP Associate Professor Growth Grant and the University of Colorado Dean's Fund for Excellence.

The constraints of temperature, energy, dioxygen and space seemed to preclude the possibility of more-complex, multicellular organisms from surviving at these depths. Here we report species of the phylum Nematoda that have been detected in or recovered from 0.9-3.6-kilometre-deep fracture water in the deep mines of South Africa but have not been detected in the mining water. These subsurface nematodes, including a new species, Halicephalobus mephisto, tolerate high temperature, reproduce asexually and preferentially feed upon subsurface bacteria. Carbon-14 data indicate that the fracture water in which the nematodes reside is 3,000-12,000-year-old palaeometeoric water. Our data suggest that nematodes should be found in other deep hypoxic settings where temperature permits, and that they may control the microbial population density by grazing on fracture surface biofilm patches. Our results expand the known metazoan biosphere and demonstrate that deep ecosystems are more complex than previously accepted. The discovery of multicellular life in the deep subsurface of the Earth also has important implications for the search for subsurface life on other planets in our Solar System.","[Borgonie, G.; Bert, W.] Univ Ghent, Dept Biol, Nematol Sect, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Garcia-Moyano, A.; Litthauer, D.; Bester, A.; van Heerden, E.; Moeller, C.; Erasmus, M.] Univ Free State, Dept Microbial Biochem & Food Biotechnol, ZA-9300 Bloemfontein, South Africa; [Bert, W.] Wageningen Univ, Dept Plant Sci, Nematol Lab, NL-6708 Wageningen, Netherlands; [Onstott, T.

The few skulls known are generally crushed, incomplete or both(1-4), and associated postcranial material is extremely rare. Here we report the discovery of an exceptionally large number of almost undistorted, nearly complete skulls and skeletons of a stem-metatherian, Pucadelphys andinus, in the early Palaeocene epoch(5) of Tiupampa in Bolivia(6-8). These give an unprecedented glimpse into early metatherian morphology, evolutionary relationships and, especially, ecology. The remains of 35 individuals have been collected, with 22 of these represented by nearly complete skulls and associated postcrania. These individuals were probably buried in a single catastrophic event, and so almost certainly belong to the same population(9). The preservation of multiple adult, sub-adult and juvenile individuals in close proximity (<1 m(2)) is indicative of gregarious social behaviour or at least a high degree of social tolerance and frequent interaction. Such behaviour is unknown in living didelphids, which are highly solitary and have been regarded, perhaps wrongly, as the most generalized living marsupials. The Tiupampan P. andinus population also exhibits strong sexual dimorphism, which, in combination with gregariousness, suggests strong male-male competition and polygyny. Our study shows that social interactions occurred in metatherians as early as the basal Palaeocene and that solitary behaviour may not be plesiomorphic for Metatheria as a whole.","[Ladeveze, Sandrine] Royal Belgian Inst Nat Sci, Dept Palaeontol, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [de Muizon, Christian; Germain, Damien] UPMC, MNHN, Dept Hist tERRE, CNRS,UMR7207,CR2P, F-75005 Paris, France; [Beck, Robin M.

The CO2 detection machinery is therefore an ideal target to disrupt host seeking. Here we use electrophysiological assays to identify a volatile odorant that causes an unusual, ultra-prolonged activation of CO2-detecting neurons in three major disease-transmitting mosquitoes: Anopheles gambiae, Culex quinquefasciatus and A. aegypti. Importantly, ultra-prolonged activation of these neurons severely compromises their ability subsequently to detect CO2 for several minutes. We also identify odours that strongly inhibit CO2-sensitive neurons as candidates for use in disruption of host-seeking behaviour, as well as an odour that evokes CO2-like activity and thus has potential use as a lure in trapping devices. Analysis of responses to panels of structurally related odours across the three mosquitoes and Drosophila, which have related CO2-receptor proteins, reveals a pattern of inhibition that is often conserved. We use video tracking in wind-tunnel experiments to demonstrate that the novel ultra-prolonged activators can completely disrupt CO2-mediated activation as well as source-finding behaviour in Aedes mosquitoes, even after the odour is no longer present. Lastly, semi-field studies demonstrate that use of ultra-prolonged activators disrupts CO2-mediated hut entry behaviour of Culex mosquitoes. The three classes of CO2-response-modifying odours offer powerful instruments for developing new generations of insect repellents and lures, which even in small quantities can interfere with the ability of mosquitoes to seek humans.","[Turner, Stephanie Lynn; Ray, Anandasankar] Univ Calif Riverside, Cellular Mol & Dev Biol Program, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Li, Nan; Carde, Ring T.; Ray, Anandasankar] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Entomol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Guda, Tom; Githure, John] ICIPE, Human Hlth Div, Nairobi, Kenya","Ray, A (reprint author), Univ Calif Riverside, Cellular Mol & Dev Biol Program, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",anand.ray@ucr.edu,,"Ray, Anandasankar/0000-0003-4133-2581",Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation through the Grand Challenges Exploration Initiative; NIAID (NIH) [R01AI087785],"We thank E.

Nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NOD) proteins are cytosolic pattern-recognition receptors of paramount importance in the intestine, and their dysregulation is associated with inflammatory bowel disease(3,4). They sense peptidoglycans from commensal microorganisms and pathogens and coordinate signalling events that culminate in the induction of inflammation and anti-microbial responses(2). However, the signalling mechanisms involved in this process are not fully understood. Here, using genome-wide RNA interference, we identify candidate genes that modulate the NOD1 inflammatory response in intestinal epithelial cells. Our results reveal a significant crosstalk between innate immunity and apoptosis and identify BID, a BCL2 family protein, as a critical component of the inflammatory response. Colonocytes depleted of BID or macrophages from Bid(-/-) mice are markedly defective in cytokine production in response to NOD activation. Furthermore, Bid(-/-) mice are unresponsive to local or systemic exposure to NOD agonists or their protective effect in experimental colitis. Mechanistically, BID interacts with NOD1, NOD2 and the I kappa B kinase (IKK) complex, impacting NF-kappa B and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signalling. Our results define a novel role of BID in inflammation and immunity independent of its apoptotic function, furthering the mounting evidence of evolutionary conservation between the mechanisms of apoptosis and immunity.","[Yeretssian, Garabet; Doiron, Karine; Saleh, Maya] McGill Univ, Dept Med, Montreal, PQ H3G 0B1, Canada; [Correa, Ricardo G.; Reed, John C.] Sanford Burnham Med Res Inst, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Fitzgerald, Patrick; Dillon, Christopher P.; Green, Douglas R.] St Jude Childrens Hosp, Memphis, TN 38105 USA","Saleh, M (reprint author), McGill Univ, Dept Med, Montreal, PQ H3G 0B1, Canada.",maya.saleh@mcgill.ca,"Correa, Ricardo/G-7613-2012; Dillon, Christopher/P-4457-2014","Correa, Ricardo/0000-0001-6940-7034; Dillon, Christopher/0000-0002-9458-0266",Canadian Institutes for Health Research [CIHR-MOP 82801]; Burroughs Wellcome Fund; McGill University Health Center; SASS Foundation for Medical Research,"We thank A.

Spines undergo activity-dependent remodelling, stabilization and pruning during development, and similar structural changes can be triggered by learning and changes in sensory experiences(1-4). However, the biochemical triggers and mechanisms of de novo spine formation in the developing brain and the functional significance of new spines to neuronal connectivity are largely unknown. Here we develop an approach to induce and monitor de novo spine formation in real time using combined two-photon laser-scanning microscopy and two-photon laser uncaging of glutamate. Our data demonstrate that, in mouse cortical layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons, glutamate is sufficient to trigger de novo spine growth from the dendrite shaft in a location-specific manner. We find that glutamate-induced spinogenesis requires opening of NMDARs (N-methyl-D-aspartate-type glutamate receptors) and activation of protein kinase A (PKA) but is independent of calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) and tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB) receptors. Furthermore, newly formed spines express glutamate receptors and are rapidly functional such that they transduce presynaptic activity into postsynaptic signals. Together, our data demonstrate that early neural connectivity is shaped by activity in a spatially precise manner and that nascent dendrite spines are rapidly functionally incorporated into cortical circuits.","[Kwon, Hyung-Bae; Sabatini, Bernardo L.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Sabatini, BL (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",bsabatini@hms.harvard.edu,,,Simons Foundation; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke [NS046579],We thank members of the Sabatini laboratory for their comments on the manuscript and assistance with data analysis.

The human E2 UBCH7 (also known as UBE2L3) shows broad specificity for HECT-type E3s(1), but often fails to function with RING E3s in vitro despite forming specific complexes(2-4). Structural comparisons of inactive UBCH7-RING complexes with active UBCH5-RING complexes reveal no defining differences(3,4), highlighting a gap in our understanding of Ub transfer. Here we show that, unlike many E2s that transfer Ub with RINGs, UBCH7 lacks intrinsic, E3-independent reactivity with lysine, explaining its preference for HECTs. Despite lacking lysine reactivity, UBCH7 exhibits activity with the RING-inbetween-RING (RBR) family of E3s that includes parkin (also known as PARK2) and human homologue of ariadne (HHARI; also known as ARIH1)(5,6). Found in all eukaryotes(7), RBRs regulate processes such as translation(8) and immune signalling(9). RBRs contain a canonical C3HC4-type RING, followed by two conserved Cys/His-rich Zn(2+)-binding domains, in-between-RING (IBR) and RING2 domains, which together define this E3 family(7). We show that RBRs function like RING/HECT hybrids: they bind E2s via a RING domain, but transfer Ub through an obligate thioester-linked Ub (denoted Ub), requiring a conserved cysteine residue in RING2. Our results define the functional cadre of E3s for UBCH7, an E2 involved in cell proliferation(10) and immune function(11), and indicate a novel mechanism for an entire class of E3s.","[Wenzel, Dawn M.; Lissounov, Alexei; Brzovic, Peter S.; Klevit, Rachel E.] Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Klevit, RE (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Box 357350, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",klevit@u.washington.edu,,,"National Institute of General Medical Sciences [5R01 GM088055, T32 GM07270]; National Science Foundation [MCB0615632]","We thank K.

NSSs for dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin are targeted by the psychostimulants cocaine and amphetamine(1), as well as by antidepressants(7). The crystal structure of LeuT, a prokaryotic NSS homologue, revealed an occluded conformation in which a leucine (Leu) and two Na+ are bound deep within the protein(8). This structure has been the basis for extensive structural and computational exploration of the functional mechanisms of proteins with a LeuT-like fold(9-22). Subsequently, an 'outward-open' conformation was determined in the presence of the inhibitor tryptophan(23), and the Na+-dependent formation of a dynamic outward-facing intermediate was identified using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy(24). In addition, single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer imaging has been used to reveal reversible transitions to an inward-open LeuT conformation, which involve the movement of transmembrane helix TM1a away from the transmembrane helical bundle(22). We investigated how substrate binding is coupled to structural transitions in LeuT during Na+-coupled transport. Here we report a process whereby substrate binding from the extracellular side of LeuT facilitates intracellular gate opening and substrate release at the intracellular face of the protein. In the presence of alanine, a substrate that is transported 10-fold faster than leucine(15,25), we observed alanine-induced dynamics in the intracellular gate region of LeuT that directly correlate with transport efficiency. Collectively, our data reveal functionally relevant and previously hidden aspects of the NSS transport mechanism that emphasize the functional importance of a second substrate (S2) binding site within the extracellular vestibule(15,20). Substrate binding in this S2 site appears to act cooperatively with the primary substrate (S1) binding site to control intracellular gating more than 30 angstrom away, in a manner that allows the Na+ gradient to power the transport mechanism.","[Zhao, Yongfang; Quick, Matthias; Javitch, Jonathan A.] Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, Ctr Mol Recognit, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Zhao, Yongfang; Quick, Matthias; Javitch, Jonathan A.] Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Javitch, Jonathan A.] Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Pharmacol, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Zhao, Yongfang; Quick, Matthias; Javitch, Jonathan A.] New York State Psychiat Inst & Hosp, Div Mol Therapeut, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Terry, Daniel S.; Shi, Lei; Weinstein, Harel; Blanchard, Scott C.] Cornell Univ, Weill Med Coll, Dept Physiol & Biophys, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Shi, Lei; Weinstein, Harel] Cornell Univ, Weill Cornell Med Coll, HRH Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz Alsau, New York, NY 10021 USA","Javitch, JA (reprint author), Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, Ctr Mol Recognit, 630 W 168th St, New York, NY 10032 USA.",scb2005@med.cornell.edu; jaj2@columbia.edu,"Zhao, Yongfang/B-5437-2010; Blanchard, Scott/A-5804-2009","Blanchard, Scott/0000-0003-2717-9365; Terry, Daniel/0000-0001-9021-0084","National Institutes of Health [DA17293, DA022413, DA12408, DA023694]; Irma T.

SiMPull can reveal how many proteins and of which kinds are present in the in vivo complex, as we show using protein kinase A. We then demonstrate a wide applicability to various signalling proteins found in the cytosol, membrane and cellular organelles, and to endogenous protein complexes from animal tissue extracts.

No experiment has ever detected this deviation. The standard model of particle physics predicts that de is far too small to detect(2), being some eleven orders of magnitude smaller than the current experimental sensitivity. However, many extensions to the standard model naturally predict much larger values of de that should be detectable(3). This makes the search for the electron EDM a powerful way to search for new physics and constrain the possible extensions. In particular, the popular idea that new supersymmetric particles may exist at masses of a few hundred GeV/c(2) (where c is the speed of light) is difficult to reconcile with the absence of an electron EDM at the present limit of sensitivity(2,4). The size of the EDM is also intimately related to the question of why the Universe has so little antimatter. If the reason is that some undiscovered particle interaction(5) breaks the symmetry between matter and antimatter, this should result in a measurable EDM in most models of particle physics(2). Here we use cold polar molecules to measure the electron EDM at the highest level of precision reported so far, providing a constraint on any possible new interactions. We obtain d(e) = (-2.4 +/- 5.7(stat) +/- 1.5(syst)) x 10(-28) e cm, where e is the charge on the electron, which sets a new upper limit of vertical bar d(e)vertical bar < 10.5 x 10(-28) e cm with 90 per cent confidence. This result, consistent with zero, indicates that the electron is spherical at this improved level of precision.

Furthermore, advances in vaccinology, including novel adjuvants, prime-boost regimes and strategies for intracellular antigen presentation, have led to progress in developing a vaccine against tuberculosis. Here we discuss these advances and suggest that new tools such as systems biology and structure-based antigen design will lead to a deeper understanding of mechanisms of protection which, in turn, will lead to rational vaccine development.

This dimorphism depends not on genetic differences, but on ingestion of royal jelly, although the mechanism through which royal jelly regulates caste differentiation has long remained unknown. Here I show that a 57-kDa protein in royal jelly, previously designated as royalactin, induces the differentiation of honeybee larvae into queens. Royalactin increased body size and ovary development and shortened developmental time in honeybees. Surprisingly, it also showed similar effects in the fruitfly (Drosophila melanogaster). Mechanistic studies revealed that royalactin activated p70 S6 kinase, which was responsible for the increase of body size, increased the activity of mitogen-activated protein kinase, which was involved in the decreased developmental time, and increased the titre of juvenile hormone, an essential hormone for ovary development. Knockdown of epidermal growth factor receptor (Egfr) expression in the fat body of honeybees and fruitflies resulted in a defect of all phenotypes induced by royalactin, showing that Egfr mediates these actions. These findings indicate that a specific factor in royal jelly, royalactin, drives queen development through an Egfr-mediated signalling pathway.","Toyama Prefectural Univ, Biotechnol Res Ctr, Toyama 9390398, Japan","Kamakura, M (reprint author), Toyama Prefectural Univ, Biotechnol Res Ctr, Toyama 9390398, Japan.",kamakura@pu-toyama.ac.jp,,,,,,37,241,274,6,164,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-May,2011,473,7348,,,,,478,483,,10.1038/nature10093,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,768QM,WOS:000290951300033,21516106.0,No,,,11/20/17,masaki,kamakura,male,1,12,na,na

For Earth, the last of these collisions involved an impact by a Mars-size embryo that formed the Moon 50-150 million years (Myr) after the birth of the Solar System(2,3). Although model simulations of the growth of terrestrial planets can reproduce the mass and dynamical parameters of the Earth and Venus, they fall short of explaining the small size of Mars(4,5). One possibility is that Mars was a planetary embryo that escaped collision and merging with other embryos(1). To assess this idea, it is crucial to know Mars' accretion timescale(6), which can be investigated using the Hf-182-W-182 decay system in shergottite-nakhlite-chassignite meteorites(6-10). Nevertheless, this timescale remains poorly constrained owing to a large uncertainty associated with the Hf/W ratio of the Martian mantle(6) and as a result, contradicting timescales have been reported that range between 0 and 15 Myr (refs 6-10). Here we show that Mars accreted very rapidly and reached about half of its present size in only 1.8(-1.0)(+0.9) Myr or less, which is consistent with a stranded planetary embryo origin. We have found a well-defined correlation between the Th/Hf and Hf-176/Hf-177 ratios in chondrites that reflects remobilization of Lu and Th during parent-body processes. Using this relationship, we estimate the Hf/W ratio in Mars' mantle to be 3.51 +/- 0.45. This value is much more precise than previous estimates, which ranged between 2.6 and 5.0 (ref. 6), and lifts the large uncertainty that plagued previous estimates of the age of Mars. Our results also demonstrate that Mars grew before dissipation of the nebular gas when similar to 100-km planetesimals, such as the parent bodies of chondrites, were still being formed. Mars' accretion occurred early enough to allow establishment of a magma ocean powered by decay of Al-26.","[Dauphas, N.; Pourmand, A.] Univ Chicago, Dept Geophys Sci, Origins Lab, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Dauphas, N.; Pourmand, A.] Univ Chicago, Enrico Fermi Inst, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Pourmand, A.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Div Marine Geol & Geophys, Miami, FL 33149 USA","Dauphas, N (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Dept Geophys Sci, Origins Lab, 5734 S Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",dauphas@uchicago.edu,"Dauphas, Nicolas/E-4568-2011",,"Packard fellowship; NASA; NSF [NNX09AG59G, EAR-0820807]","Discussions with M.

Apart from influences from the Pacific El Nino/Southern Oscillation(2) and the North Atlantic Oscillation(3), the tropical Atlantic variability is thought to be dominated by two distinct ocean-atmosphere coupled modes of variability that are characterized by meridional(4,5) and zonal(6,7) sea-surface-temperature gradients and are mainly active on decadal and interannual timescales, respectively(8,9). Here we report evidence that the intrinsic ocean dynamics of the deep equatorial Atlantic can also affect sea surface temperature, wind and rainfall in the tropical Atlantic region and constitutes a 4.5-yr climate cycle. Specifically, vertically alternating deep zonal jets of short vertical wavelength with a period of about 4.5 yr and amplitudes of more than 10 cm s(-1) are observed, in the deep Atlantic, to propagate their energy upwards, towards the surface(10,11). They are linked, at the sea surface, to equatorial zonal current anomalies and eastern Atlantic temperature anomalies that have amplitudes of about 6 cm s(-1) and 0.4 degrees C, respectively, and are associated with distinct wind and rainfall patterns. Although deep jets are also observed in the Pacific(12) and Indian(13) oceans, only the Atlantic deep jets seem to oscillate on interannual timescales. Our knowledge of the persistence and regularity of these jets is limited by the availability of high-quality data. Despite this caveat, the oscillatory behaviour can still be used to improve predictions of sea surface temperature in the tropical Atlantic. Deep-jet generation and upward energy transmission through the Equatorial Undercurrent warrant further theoretical study.","[Brandt, Peter; Funk, Andreas; Hormann, Verena; Dengler, Marcus; Greatbatch, Richard J.] Univ Kiel, Leibniz Inst Meereswissensch, IFM GEOMAR, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Toole, John M.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA","Brandt, P (reprint author), Univ Kiel, Leibniz Inst Meereswissensch, IFM GEOMAR, Dusternbrooker Weg 20, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.",pbrandt@ifm-geomar.de,"Brandt, Peter/C-8254-2013; Dengler, Marcus/A-7327-2014","Brandt, Peter/0000-0002-9235-955X; Dengler, Marcus/0000-0001-5993-9088",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research; German Science Foundation [Sonderforschungsbereich 754]; Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution's Columbus O'Donnell Iselin Chair for Excellence in Oceanography,"This study was supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research as part of the co-operative project 'North Atlantic' and by the German Science Foundation as part of the Sonderforschungsbereich 754 'Climate-Biogeochemistry Interactions in the Tropical Ocean'.

These can deform either by the diffusion of point defects (diffusion creep, with a linear relationship between strain rate and stress) or by the movement of intracrystalline dislocations (nonlinear dislocation creep)(1,2). However, there is still no reliable map showing where in the mantle each of these mechanisms is dominant, and so it is important to identify regions where the operative mechanism can be inferred directly from surface geophysical observations. Here we identify a new observable quantity-the rate of downstream decay of the anomalous seafloor topography (swell) produced by a mantle plume-which depends only on the value of the exponent in the strain rate versus stress relationship that defines the difference between diffusion and dislocation creep. Comparison of the Hawaiian swell topography with the predictions of a simple fluid mechanical model shows that the swell shape is poorly explained by diffusion creep, and requires a dislocation creep rheology. The rheology predicted by the model is reasonably consistent with laboratory deformation data for both olivine(3) and clinopyroxene(4), suggesting that the source of Hawaiian lavas could contain either or both of these components.","[Asaadi, N.; Sobouti, F.] IASBS, Zanjan 4513766731, Iran; [Ribe, N.

Direct evidence of fossils within rocks of nonmarine origin in the Precambrian is exceedingly rare(5,6). The most widely cited example comprises a single report of morphologically simple mineralized tubes and spheres interpreted as cyanobacteria, obtained from 1,200-Myr-old palaeokarst in Arizona(5). Organic-walled microfossils were first described from the non-marine Torridonian (1.2-1.0 Gyr ago) sequence of northwest Scotland in 1907(7). Subsequent studies(8-10) found few distinctive taxa-a century later, the Torridonian microflora is still being characterized as primarily nondescript ""leiospheres''(11). We have comprehensively sampled grey shales and phosphatic nodules throughout the Torridonian sequence. Here we report the recovery of large populations of diverse organic-walled microfossils extracted by acid maceration, complemented by studies using thin sections of phosphatic nodules that yield exceptionally detailed three-dimensional preservation. These assemblages contain multicellular structures, complex-walled cysts, asymmetric organic structures, and dorsiventral, compressed organic thalli, some approaching one millimetre in diameter. They offer direct evidence of eukaryotes living in freshwater aquatic and subaerially exposed habitats during the Proterozoic era. The apparent dominance of eukaryotes in non-marine settings by 1 Gyr ago indicates that eukaryotic evolution on land may have commenced far earlier than previously thought.","[Strother, Paul K.] Boston Coll, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Weston, MA 02493 USA; [Battison, Leila; Brasier, Martin D.] Univ Oxford, Dept Earth Sci, Oxford OX1 3PR, England; [Wellman, Charles H.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England","Strother, PK (reprint author), Boston Coll, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Weston, MA 02493 USA.",Strother@bc.edu,,"Strother, Paul/0000-0003-0550-1704","NASA [NNX07AU79G]; NERC [NE/G015716/1, NE/G524060/1]","J.

They are characterized by a pair of anterior, segmented appendages, a circlet of plates around the mouth, and an elongate segmented trunk lacking true tergites with a pair of flexible lateral lobes per segment(1,2). Disarticulated body parts, such as the anterior appendages and oral circlet, had been assigned to a range of taxonomic groups-but the discovery of complete specimens from the middle Cambrian Burgess Shale showed that these disparate elements all belong to a single kind of animal(3). Phylogenetic analyses support a position of anomalocaridids in the arthropod stem, as a sister group to the euarthropods(4-6). The anomalocaridids were the largest animals in Cambrian communities. The youngest unequivocal examples occur in the middle Cambrian Marjum Formation of Utah(7) but an arthropod retaining some anomalocaridid characteristics is present in the Devonian of Germany(5). Here we report the post-Cambrian occurrence of anomalocaridids, from the Early Ordovician (488-472 million years ago) Fezouata Biota(8) in southeastern Morocco, including specimens larger than any in Cambrian biotas. These giant animals were an important element of some marine communities for about 30 million years longer than previously realized. The Moroccan specimens confirm the presence of a dorsal array of flexible blades attached to a transverse rachis on the trunk segments; these blades probably functioned as gills.","[Van Roy, Peter; Briggs, Derek E.

Learning of new skills is correlated with formation of new synapses(6-8). These may directly encode new memories, but they may also have more general roles in memory encoding and retrieval processes(2). Here we investigated how mossy fibre terminal complexes at the entry of hippocampal and cerebellar circuits rearrange upon learning in mice, and what is the functional role of the rearrangements. We show that one-trial and incremental learning lead to robust, circuit-specific, long-lasting and reversible increases in the numbers of filopodial synapses onto fast-spiking interneurons that trigger feedforward inhibition. The increase in feedforward inhibition connectivity involved a majority of the presynaptic terminals, restricted the numbers of c-Fos-expressing postsynaptic neurons at memory retrieval, and correlated temporally with the quality of the memory. We then show that for contextual fear conditioning and Morris water maze learning, increased feedforward inhibition connectivity by hippocampal mossy fibres has a critical role for the precision of the memory and the learned behaviour. In the absence of mossy fibre long-term potentiation in Rab3a(-/-) mice(9), c-Fos ensemble reorganization and feedforward inhibition growth were both absent in CA3 upon learning, and the memory was imprecise. By contrast, in the absence of adducin 2 (Add2; also known as beta-adducin)(10) c-Fos reorganization was normal, but feedforward inhibition growth was abolished. In parallel, c-Fos ensembles in CA3 were greatly enlarged, and the memory was imprecise. Feedforward inhibition growth and memory precision were both rescued by re-expression of Add2 specifically in hippocampal mossy fibres. These results establish a causal relationship between learning-related increases in the numbers of defined synapses and the precision of learning and memory in the adult. The results further relate plasticity and feedforward inhibition growth at hippocampal mossy fibres to the precision of hippocampus-dependent memories.","[Ruediger, Sarah; Vittori, Claudia; Bednarek, Ewa; Genoud, Christel; Caroni, Pico] Friedrich Miescher Inst, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland; [Vittori, Claudia; Strata, Piergiorgio; Sacchetti, Benedetto] Dept Neurosci, I-10125 Turin, Italy; [Vittori, Claudia; Strata, Piergiorgio; Sacchetti, Benedetto] Natl Inst Neurosci Italy, I-10125 Turin, Italy","Caroni, P (reprint author), Friedrich Miescher Inst, Maulbeerstr 66, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland.",caroni@fmi.ch,,"Ruediger, Sarah/0000-0001-9140-872X; Vittori, Claudia/0000-0002-3467-5984; Sacchetti, Benedetto/0000-0002-8695-8310",,,,30,111,112,4,35,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,26-May,2011,473,7348,,,,,514,U258,,10.1038/nature09946,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,768QM,WOS:000290951300041,21532590.0,No,,,11/20/17,pico,caroni,male,1,2,na,na

The lack of systematic and longitudinal influenza surveillance in pigs has hampered attempts to reconstruct the origins of this pandemic(4). Most existing swine data were derived from opportunistic samples collected from diseased pigs in disparate geographical regions, not from prospective studies in defined locations, hence the evolutionary and transmission dynamics of SwIV are poorly understood. Here we quantify the epidemiological, genetic and antigenic dynamics of SwIV in Hong Kong using a data set of more than 650 SwIV isolates and more than 800 swine sera from 12 years of systematic surveillance in this region, supplemented with data stretching back 34 years. Intercontinental virus movement has led to reassortment and lineage replacement, creating an antigenically and genetically diverse virus population whose dynamics are quantitatively different from those previously observed for human influenza viruses. Our findings indicate that increased antigenic drift is associated with reassortment events and offer insights into the emergence of influenza viruses with epidemic potential in swine and humans.","[Vijaykrishna, Dhanasekaran; Smith, Gavin J.

However, the initial establishment of infection in the first few days after mucosal exposure, before viral dissemination and massive replication, may be more vulnerable to immune control(4). Here we report that SIV vaccines that include rhesus cytomegalovirus (RhCMV) vectors(5) establish indefinitely persistent, high-frequency, SIV-specific effector memory T-cell (T(EM)) responses at potential sites of SIV replication in rhesus macaques and stringently control highly pathogenic SIV(MAC239) infection early after mucosal challenge. Thirteen of twenty-four rhesus macaques receiving either RhCMV vectors alone or RhCMV vectors followed by adenovirus 5 (Ad5) vectors (versus 0 of 9 DNA/Ad5-vaccinated rhesus macaques) manifested early complete control of SIV (undetectable plasma virus), and in twelve of these thirteen animals we observed long-term (>= 1 year) protection. This was characterized by: occasional blips of plasma viraemia that ultimately waned; predominantly undetectable cell-associated viral load in blood and lymph node mononuclear cells; no depletion of effector-site CD4(+) memory T cells; no induction or boosting of SIV Env-specific antibodies; and induction and then loss of T-cell responses to an SIV protein (Vif) not included in the RhCMV vectors. Protection correlated with the magnitude of the peak SIV-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses in the vaccine phase, and occurred without anamnestic T-cell responses. Remarkably, long-term RhCMV vector-associated SIV control was insensitive to either CD8(+) or CD4(+) lymphocyte depletion and, at necropsy, cell-associated SIV was only occasionally measurable at the limit of detection with ultrasensitive assays, observations that indicate the possibility of eventual viral clearance. Thus, persistent vectors such as CMV and their associated TEM responses might significantly contribute to an efficacious HIV/AIDS vaccine.","[Hansen, Scott G.; Ford, Julia C.; Lewis, Matthew S.; Ventura, Abigail B.; Hughes, Colette M.; Coyne-Johnson, Lia; Whizin, Nathan; Swanson, Tonya; Legasse, Alfred W.; Axthelm, Michael K.; Nelson, Jay A.; Jarvis, Michael A.; Picker, Louis J.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Vaccine & Gene Therapy Inst, Dept Mol Microbiol & Immunol, Beaverton, OR 97006 USA; [Hansen, Scott G.; Ford, Julia C.; Lewis, Matthew S.; Ventura, Abigail B.; Hughes, Colette M.; Coyne-Johnson, Lia; Whizin, Nathan; Swanson, Tonya; Legasse, Alfred W.; Axthelm, Michael K.; Nelson, Jay A.; Jarvis, Michael A.; Picker, Louis J.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Vaccine & Gene Therapy Inst, Dept Pathol, Beaverton, OR 97006 USA; [Hansen, Scott G.; Ford, Julia C.; Lewis, Matthew S.; Ventura, Abigail B.; Hughes, Colette M.; Coyne-Johnson, Lia; Whizin, Nathan; Swanson, Tonya; Legasse, Alfred W.; Axthelm, Michael K.; Nelson, Jay A.; Jarvis, Michael A.; Picker, Louis J.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Oregon Natl Primate Res Ctr, Beaverton, OR 97006 USA; [Oswald, Kelli; Shoemaker, Rebecca; Piatak, Michael, Jr.; Lifson, Jeffrey D.] NCI, AIDS & Canc Virus Program, SAIC Frederick Inc, Frederick, MD 21702 USA; [Chiuchiolo, Maria J.; Parks, Christopher L.] Int AIDS Vaccine Initiat, Vaccine Design & Dev Lab, Brooklyn, NY 11220 USA","Picker, LJ (reprint author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Vaccine & Gene Therapy Inst, Dept Mol Microbiol & Immunol, Beaverton, OR 97006 USA.",pickerl@ohsu.edu,,"Jarvis, Michael/0000-0002-0124-4061","National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [RO1 AI060392, HHSN272200900037C]; International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI); United States Agency for International Development (USAID); Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; National Center for Research Resources [P51 RR00163, R24 RR016001]; National Cancer Institute [HHSN261200800001E]","This work was supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (RO1 AI060392; contract #HHSN272200900037C); the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) and its donors, particularly the United States Agency for International Development (USAID); the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation-supported Collaboration for AIDS Vaccine Discovery; the National Center for Research Resources (P51 RR00163; R24 RR016001); and the National Cancer Institute (contract HHSN261200800001E).

Chronic activation of ER stress has been shown to have an important role in the development of insulin resistance and diabetes in obesity(2). However, the mechanisms that lead to chronic ER stress in a metabolic context in general, and in obesity in particular, are not understood. Here we comparatively examined the proteomic and lipidomic landscape of hepatic ER purified from lean and obese mice to explore the mechanisms of chronic ER stress in obesity. We found suppression of protein but stimulation of lipid synthesis in the obese ER without significant alterations in chaperone content. Alterations in ER fatty acid and lipid composition result in the inhibition of sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) activity and ER stress. Correcting the obesity-induced alteration of ER phospholipid composition or hepatic Serca overexpression in vivo both reduced chronic ER stress and improved glucose homeostasis. Hence, we established that abnormal lipid and calcium metabolism are important contributors to hepatic ER stress in obesity.","[Fu, Suneng; Yang, Ling; Li, Ping; Ivanov, Alexander R.; Hotamisligil, Goekhan S.] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Genet & Complex Dis, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Fu, Suneng; Yang, Ling; Li, Ping; Ivanov, Alexander R.; Hotamisligil, Goekhan S.] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Nutr, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Hofmann, Oliver; Dicker, Lee; Hide, Winston; Lin, Xihong] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Watkins, Steven M.] Lip Technol Inc, W Sacramento, CA 95691 USA; [Hotamisligil, Goekhan S.] Broad Inst Harvard & MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA","Hotamisligil, GS (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Genet & Complex Dis, 665 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",ghotamis@hsph.harvard.edu,"Yang, Ling/C-8000-2011","Hofmann, Oliver/0000-0002-7738-1513; Hide, Winston/0000-0002-8621-3271","National Institutes of Health [DK52539, 1RC4-DK090942]; Syndexa Pharmaceuticals; NIH/NIEHS [T32ES007155]","We thank A.

Here we characterize the signalling events taking place during early morphogenesis of chick skeletal muscles. We show that muscle progenitors present in somites require the transient activation of NOTCH signalling to undergo terminal differentiation. The NOTCH ligand Delta1 is expressed in a mosaic pattern in neural crest cells that migrate past the somites. Gain and loss of Delta1 function in neural crest modifies NOTCH signalling in somites, which results in delayed or premature myogenesis. Our results indicate that the neural crest regulates early muscle formation by a unique mechanism that relies on the migration of Delta1-expressing neural crest cells to trigger the transient activation of NOTCH signalling in selected muscle progenitors. This dynamic signalling guarantees a balanced and progressive differentiation of the muscle progenitor pool.","[Rios, Anne C.; Serralbo, Olivier; Salgado, David; Marcelle, Christophe] Monash Univ, EMBL Australia, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Rios, Anne C.; Serralbo, Olivier; Salgado, David; Marcelle, Christophe] Monash Univ, ARMI, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia","Marcelle, C (reprint author), Monash Univ, EMBL Australia, Bldg 75, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",christophe.marcelle@monash.edu,"SALGADO, David/A-1417-2014",,Agence Nationale pour le Recherche (ANR); EU,"We thank N.

Four of the five major components of the spliceosome, U1, U2, U4 and U5 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), contain seven Sm proteins (SmB/B9, SmD1, SmD2, SmD3, SmE, SmF and SmG) in common(4,5). Following export of the U1, U2, U4 and U5 snRNAs to the cytoplasm(6,7), the seven Sm proteins, chaperoned by the survival of motor neurons (SMN) complex, assemble around a single-stranded, U-rich sequence called the Sm site in each small nuclear RNA (snRNA), to form the core domain of the respective snRNP particle(8,9). Core domain formation is a prerequisite for re-import into the nucleus(10), where these snRNPs mature via addition of their particle-specific proteins. Here we present a crystal structure of the U4 snRNP core domain at 3.6 angstrom resolution, detailing how the Sm site heptad (AUUUUUG) binds inside the central hole of the heptameric ring of Sm proteins, interacting one-to-one with SmE-SmG-SmD3-SmB-SmD1-SmD2-SmF. An irregular backbone conformation of the Sm site sequence combined with the asymmetric structure of the heteromeric protein ring allows each base to interact in a distinct manner with four key residues at equivalent positions in the L3 and L5 loops of the Sm fold. A comparison of this structure with the U1 snRNP at 5.5 angstrom resolution(11,12) reveals snRNA-dependent structural changes outside the Sm fold, which may facilitate the binding of particle-specific proteins that are crucial to biogenesis of spliceosomal snRNPs.","[Leung, Adelaine K.

Despite extensive work(9-14), molecular replacement or the subsequent rebuilding usually fail with more divergent starting models based on remote homologues with less than 30% sequence identity. Here we show that this limitation can be substantially reduced by combining algorithms for protein structure modelling with those developed for crystallographic structure determination. An approach integrating Rosetta structure modelling with Autobuild chain tracing yielded high-resolution structures for 8 of 13 X-ray diffraction data sets that could not be solved in the laboratories of expert crystallographers and that remained unsolved after application of an extensive array of alternative approaches. We estimate that the new method should allow rapid structure determination without experimental phase information for over half the cases where current methods fail, given diffraction data sets of better than 3.2 angstrom resolution, four or fewer copies in the asymmetric unit, and the availability of structures of homologous proteins with >20% sequence identity.","[Terwilliger, Thomas C.] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA; [DiMaio, Frank; Baker, David] Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [DiMaio, Frank; Baker, David] Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Read, Randy J.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Haematol, Cambridge Inst Med Res, Cambridge CB2 0XY, England; [Wlodawer, Alexander] NCI, Macromol Crystallog Lab, Frederick, MD 21702 USA; [Oberdorfer, Gustav; Wagner, Ulrike] Graz Univ, Inst Mol Biosci, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Valkov, Eugene] Univ Cambridge, Dept Biochem, Cambridge CB2 1GA, England; [Alon, Assaf; Fass, Deborah] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Biol Struct, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Axelrod, Herbert L.; Das, Debanu] SLAC Natl Accelerator Lab, Joint Ctr Struct Genom, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Axelrod, Herbert L.; Das, Debanu] SLAC Natl Accelerator Lab, SSRL, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Vorobiev, Sergey M.] Columbia Univ, NE Struct Genom Consortium, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Iwai, Hideo] Univ Helsinki, Inst Biotechnol, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Pokkuluri, P.

Recently, TET1 was found to hydroxylate the methyl group of mC, converting it to 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine (hmC). Here we show that TET1 binds throughout the genome of embryonic stem cells, with the majority of binding sites located at transcription start sites (TSSs) of CpG-rich promoters and within genes. The hmC modification is found in gene bodies and in contrast to mC is also enriched at CpG-rich TSSs. We provide evidence further that TET1 has a role in transcriptional repression. TET1 binds a significant proportion of Polycomb group target genes. Furthermore, TET1 associates and colocalizes with the SIN3A co-repressor complex. We propose that TET1 fine-tunes transcription, opposes aberrant DNA methylation at CpG-rich sequences and thereby contributes to the regulation of DNA methylation fidelity.","[Williams, Kristine; Christensen, Jesper; Pedersen, Marianne Terndrup; Johansen, Jens V.; Cloos, Paul A.

The recent demonstration that members of the Ten-eleven translocation (Tet) family of proteins can convert 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine raised the possibility that Tet proteins are capable of establishing a distinct epigenetic state(2,3). We have recently demonstrated that Tet1 is specifically expressed in murine embryonic stem (ES) cells and is required for ES cell maintenance(2). Using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput DNA sequencing, here we show in mouse ES cells that Tet1 is preferentially bound to CpG-rich sequences at promoters of both transcriptionally active and Polycomb-repressed genes. Despite an increase in levels of DNA methylation at many Tet1-binding sites, Tet1 depletion does not lead to downregulation of all the Tet1 targets. Interestingly, although Tet1-mediated promoter hypomethylation is required for maintaining the expression of a group of transcriptionally active genes, it is also involved in repression of Polycomb-targeted developmental regulators. Tet1 contributes to silencing of this group of genes by facilitating recruitment of PRC2 to CpG-rich gene promoters. Thus, our study not only establishes a role for Tet1 in modulating DNA methylation levels at CpG-rich promoters, but also reveals a dual function of Tet1 in promoting transcription of pluripotency factors as well as participating in the repression of Polycomb-targeted developmental regulators.","[D'Alessio, Ana C.; Ito, Shinsuke; Xia, Kai; Zhang, Yi] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Lineberger Comprehens Canc Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Wu, Hao; Sun, Yi Eve] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, IDDRC Semel Inst Neurosci & Human Behav, Dept Mol & Med Pharmacol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Wu, Hao; Sun, Yi Eve] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, IDDRC Semel Inst Neurosci & Human Behav, Dept Psychiat & Biobehav Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Wang, Zhibin] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth Sci, Lab Human Environm Epigenomes, Baltimore, MD 21025 USA; [Cui, Kairong; Zhao, Keji] NHLBI, Lab Mol Immunol, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Zhang, Y (reprint author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Lineberger Comprehens Canc Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",yi_zhang@med.unc.edu,"Wu, Hao/G-4145-2013; Xia, Kai/B-7214-2014","Wu, Hao/0000-0002-1256-6891; ","NIH [GM68804, R56MH082068]; Division of Intramural Research of National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, NIH","We thank B.

Whereas mRNA and protein levels correlated better than previously thought, corresponding half-lives showed no correlation. Using a quantitative model we have obtained the first genome-scale prediction of synthesis rates of mRNAs and proteins. We find that the cellular abundance of proteins is predominantly controlled at the level of translation. Genes with similar combinations of mRNA and protein stability shared functional properties, indicating that half-lives evolved under energetic and dynamic constraints.

Here, we report the discovery of a population of unbound or distant Jupiter-mass objects, which are almost twice (1.8(-0.8)(+1.7)) as common as main-sequence stars, based on two years of gravitational microlensing survey observations towards the Galactic Bulge. These planetary-mass objects have no host stars that can be detected within about ten astronomical units by gravitational microlensing. However, a comparison with constraints from direct imaging(9) suggests that most of these planetary-mass objects are not bound to any host star. An abrupt change in the mass function at about one Jupiter mass favours the idea that their formation process is different from that of stars and brown dwarfs.

However, the relatively short-lived expansion in nuclear collisions allows antimatter to decouple quickly from matter, and avoid annihilation. Thus, a high-energy accelerator of heavy nuclei provides an efficient means of producing and studying antimatter. The antimatter helium-4 nucleus ((4)(He) over bar), also known as the anti-alpha ((alpha) over bar), consists of two antiprotons and two antineutrons (baryon number B = -4). It has not been observed previously, although the alpha-particle was identified a century ago by Rutherford and is present in cosmic radiation at the ten per cent level(2). Antimatter nuclei with B -1 have been observed only as rare products of interactions at particle accelerators, where the rate of antinucleus production in high-energy collisions decreases by a factor of about 1,000 with each additional antinucleon(3-5). Here we report the observation of (4)<(He) over bar, the heaviest observed antinucleus to date. In total, 18 (4)(He) over bar counts were detected at the STAR experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC; ref. 6) in 10(9) recorded gold-on-gold (Au+Au) collisions at centre-of-mass energies of 200 GeV and 62 GeV per nucleon-nucleon pair. The yield is consistent with expectations from thermodynamic(7) and coalescent nucleosynthesis(8) models, providing an indication of the production rate of even heavier antimatter nuclei and a benchmark for possible future observations of (4)(He) over bar in cosmic radiation.","[Agakishiev, H.; Alakhverdyants, A.

The Canadian Arctic Archipelago, located off the northwestern shore of Greenland, contains one-third of the global volume of land ice outside the ice sheets(6), but its contribution to sea-level change remains largely unknown. Here we show that the Canadian Arctic Archipelago has recently lost 61 +/- 7 gigatonnes per year (Gt yr(-1)) of ice, contributing 0.17 +/- 0.02 mm yr(-1) to sea-level rise. Our estimates are of regional mass changes for the ice caps and glaciers of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago referring to the years 2004 to 2009 and are based on three independent approaches: surface mass-budget modelling plus an estimate of ice discharge (SMB+D), repeat satellite laser altimetry (ICESat) and repeat satellite gravimetry (GRACE). All three approaches show consistent and large mass-loss estimates. Between the periods 2004-2006 and 2007-2009, the rate of mass loss sharply increased from 31 +/- 8 Gt yr(-1) to 92 +/- 12 Gt yr(-1) in direct response to warmer summer temperatures, to which rates of ice loss are highly sensitive (64 +/- 14 Gt yr(-1) per 1 K increase). The duration of the study is too short to establish a long-term trend, but for 2007-2009, the increase in the rate of mass loss makes the Canadian Arctic Archipelago the single largest contributor to eustatic sea-level rise outside Greenland and Antarctica.","[Gardner, Alex S.; Sharp, Martin J.] Univ Alberta, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E3, Canada; [Gardner, Alex S.] Univ Michigan, Dept Atmospher Ocean & Space Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Moholdt, Geir] Univ Oslo, Dept Geosci, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Moholdt, Geir] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Inst Geophys & Planetary Phys, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Wouters, Bert] Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst, NL-3730 AE De Bilt, Netherlands; [Wolken, Gabriel J.] Alaska Dept Nat Resources, Div Geol & Geophys Surveys, Fairbanks, AK 99709 USA; [Burgess, David O.] Geol Survey Canada, Ottawa, ON K1A 0E8, Canada; [Cogley, J.

The core freezes from the innermost surface outward, growing the solid inner core and releasing light elements that drive compositional convection(1-3). Mantle convection extracts heat from the core at a rate that has enormous lateral variations(4). Here we use geodynamo simulations to show that these variations are transferred to the inner-core boundary and can be large enough to cause heat to flow into the inner core. If this were to occur in the Earth, it would cause localized melting. Melting releases heavy liquid that could form the variable-composition layer suggested by an anomaly in seismic velocity in the 150 kilometres immediately above the inner-core boundary(5-7). This provides a very simple explanation of the existence of this layer, which otherwise requires additional assumptions such as locking of the inner core to the mantle, translation from its geopotential centre(7,8) or convection with temperature equal to the solidus but with composition varying from the outer to the inner core(9). The predominantly narrow downwellings associated with freezing and broad upwellings associated with melting mean that the area of melting could be quite large despite the average dominance of freezing necessary to keep the dynamo going. Localized melting and freezing also provides a strong mechanism for creating seismic anomalies in the inner core itself, much stronger than the effects of variations in heat flow so far considered(10).","[Sreenivasan, Binod] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Kanpur 208016, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Gubbins, David] SIO, IGPP, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Gubbins, David; Mound, Jon; Rost, Sebastian] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England","Sreenivasan, B (reprint author), Indian Inst Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Kanpur 208016, Uttar Pradesh, India.",bsreeni@iitk.ac.in,,"Gubbins, David/0000-0002-8125-4752; Mound, Jon/0000-0002-1243-6915",,,,31,62,62,4,58,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,19-May,2011,473,7347,,,,,361,U53,,10.1038/nature10068,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,765QA,WOS:000290722400045,21593868.0,No,,,11/20/17,sebastian,rost,male,1,1459,na,na

The evolutionary origins of amphisbaenians are controversial, with molecular data uniting them with lacertids(3,4), a clade of Old World terrestrial lizards, whereas morphology supports a grouping with snakes and other limbless squamates(5-9). Reports of fossil stem amphisbaenians(10) have been falsified(11), and no fossils have previously tested these competing phylogenetic hypotheses or shed light on ancestral amphisbaenian ecology. Here we report the discovery of a new lacertid-like lizard from the Eocene Messel locality of Germany that provides the first morphological evidence for lacertid-amphisbaenian monophyly on the basis of a reinforced, akinetic skull roof and braincase, supporting the view that body elongation and limblessness in amphisbaenians and snakes evolved independently. Morphometric analysis of body shape and ecology in squamates indicates that the postcranial anatomy of the new taxon is most consistent with opportunistically burrowing habits, which in combination with cranial reinforcement indicates that head-first burrowing evolved before body elongation and may have been a crucial first step in the evolution of amphisbaenian fossoriality.","[Mueller, Johannes; Hipsley, Christy A.] Humboldt Univ, Leibniz Inst Evolut & Biodiversitatsforsch, Museum Nat Kunde, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Hipsley, Christy A.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Head, Jason J.; Reisz, Robert R.] Univ Toronto, Dept Biol, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada; [Kardjilov, Nikolay; Hilger, Andre] Helmholtz Zentrum Berlin Mat & Energie, D-14109 Berlin, Germany; [Wuttke, Michael] Gen Direkt Kulturelles Erbe RLP, Direkt Landesarchaol, D-55116 Mainz, Germany","Muller, J (reprint author), Humboldt Univ, Leibniz Inst Evolut & Biodiversitatsforsch, Museum Nat Kunde, Invalidenstr 43, D-10115 Berlin, Germany.",johannes.mueller@mfn-berlin.de,"Muller, Johannes/A-6293-2017","Muller, Johannes/0000-0001-5801-856X",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung,"We thank S.

Despite its importance, estimating extinction rates is still highly uncertain because no proven direct methods or reliable data exist for verifying extinctions. The most widely used indirect method is to estimate extinction rates by reversing the species-area accumulation curve, extrapolating backwards to smaller areas to calculate expected species loss. Estimates of extinction rates based on this method are almost always much higher than those actually observed(2-5). This discrepancy gave rise to the concept of an 'extinction debt', referring to species 'committed to extinction' owing to habitat loss and reduced population size but not yet extinct during a non-equilibrium period(6,7). Here we show that the extinction debt as currently defined is largely a sampling artefact due to an unrecognized difference between the underlying sampling problems when constructing a species-area relationship (SAR) and when extrapolating species extinction from habitat loss. The key mathematical result is that the area required to remove the last individual of a species (extinction) is larger, almost always much larger, than the sample area needed to encounter the first individual of a species, irrespective of species distribution and spatial scale. We illustrate these results with data from a global network of large, mapped forest plots and ranges of passerine bird species in the continental USA; and we show that overestimation can be greater than 160%. Although we conclude that extinctions caused by habitat loss require greater loss of habitat than previously thought, our results must not lead to complacency about extinction due to habitat loss, which is a real and growing threat.","[He, Fangliang] Sun Yat Sen Univ, State Key Lab Biocontrol, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [He, Fangliang] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Life Sci, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [He, Fangliang] Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada; [Hubbell, Stephen P.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Hubbell, Stephen P.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Ctr Trop Forest Sci, Unit 0948, APO, AA 34002 USA","He, FL (reprint author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, State Key Lab Biocontrol, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",fhe@mail.sysu.edu.cn; shubbell@eeb.ucla.edu,,,Sun Yat-sen University; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (Canada); NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration); US National Science Foundation,"We acknowledge the work of the principal investigators and their field assistants for collecting the field data on the large plots of the Center for Tropical Forest Science network.

The reason for the lack of correspondence between the prevalence of exposure to psychological trauma and the development of anxiety is unknown. Extracellular proteolysis contributes to fear-associated responses by facilitating neuronal plasticity at the neuron-matrix interface(1-4). Here we show in mice that the serine protease neuropsin is critical for stress-related plasticity in the amygdala by regulating the dynamics of the EphB2-NMDA-receptor interaction, the expression of Fkbp5 and anxiety-like behaviour. Stress results in neuropsin-dependent cleavage of EphB2 in the amygdala causing dissociation of EphB2 from the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor and promoting membrane turnover of EphB2 receptors. Dynamic EphB2-NR1 interaction enhances NMDA receptor current, induces Fkbp5 gene expression and enhances behavioural signatures of anxiety. On stress, neuropsin-deficient mice do not show EphB2 cleavage and its dissociation from NR1 resulting in a static EphB2-NR1 interaction, attenuated induction of the Fkbp5 gene and low anxiety. The behavioural response to stress can be restored by intra-amygdala injection of neuropsin into neuropsin-deficient mice and disrupted by the injection of either anti-EphB2 antibodies or silencing the Fkbp5 gene in the amygdala of wild-type mice. Our findings establish a novel neuronal pathway linking stress-induced proteolysis of EphB2 in the amygdala to anxiety.","[Attwood, Benjamin K.; Bourgognon, Julie-Myrtille; Patel, Satyam; Mucha, Mariusz; Schiavon, Emanuele; Skrzypiec, Anna E.; Pawlak, Robert] Univ Leicester, Dept Cell Physiol & Pharmacol, Leicester LE1 9HN, Leics, England; [Young, Kenneth W.] MRC, Toxicol Unit, Leicester LE1 9HN, Leics, England; [Shiosaka, Sadao] Nara Inst Sci & Technol, Div Struct Cell Biol, Nara 6300192, Japan; [Korostynski, Michal; Piechota, Marcin; Przewlocki, Ryszard] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Pharmacol, Dept Mol Neuropharmacol, PL-31343 Krakow, Poland","Pawlak, R (reprint author), Univ Leicester, Dept Cell Physiol & Pharmacol, Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 9HN, Leics, England.",rp135@le.ac.uk,"Piechota, Marcin/G-9464-2011; Shiosaka, Sadao/B-1142-2008",,"Medical Research Council [G0500231/73852]; European Commission [MEXT-CT-2006-042265, LSHM-CT-2004-005166]; Medisearch Fellowship; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan [20300128]; Japan Science and Technology Agency; Ministry of Science and Higher Education of Poland [NN405 274137]","This work was supported by a Medical Research Council Project Grant (G0500231/73852), and a Marie Curie Excellence Grant (MEXT-CT-2006-042265 from the European Commission) to R.

In nature, disease-free plants can be regenerated from SAM despite infections elsewhere, which underlies a horticultural practice for decades(3). However, the molecular basis of the SAM immunity remains unclear. Here we show that the CLAVATA3 peptide (CLV3p), expressed and secreted from stem cells and functioning as a key regulator of stem-cell homeostasis in the SAM of Arabidopsis(1,2,4), can trigger immune signalling and pathogen resistance via the flagellin receptor kinase FLS2 (refs 5, 6). CLV3p-FLS2 signalling acts independently from the stem-cell signalling pathway mediated through CLV1 and CLV2 receptors(1,2,4), and is uncoupled from FLS2-mediated growth suppression(5,6). Endogenous CLV3p perception in the SAM by a pattern recognition receptor for bacterial flagellin, FLS2, breaks the previously defined self and non-self discrimination in innate immunity(6,7). The dual perception of CLV3p illustrates co-evolution of plant peptide and receptor kinase signalling for both development and immunity. The enhanced immunity in SAM or germ lines may represent a common strategy towards immortal fate in plants and animals(1,2,8).","[Lee, Horim; Chah, Ok-Kyong; Sheen, Jen] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Mol Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Lee, Horim; Chah, Ok-Kyong; Sheen, Jen] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Computat & Integrat Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Lee, Horim; Chah, Ok-Kyong; Sheen, Jen] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02114 USA","Lee, H (reprint author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Mol Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",hrlee@molbio.mgh.harvard.edu; sheen@molbio.mgh.harvard.edu,,,NSF; NIH; MGH CCIB fund,"We thank T.

In animal epithelia, conserved junctional complexes establish membrane diffusion barriers, cellular adherence and sealing of the extracellular space(1). Plant cellular barriers are of independent evolutionary origin. The root endodermis strongly resembles a polarized epithelium and functions in nutrient uptake and stress resistance(2). Its defining features are the Casparian strips, belts of specialized cell wall material that generate an extracellular diffusion barrier(2). The mechanisms localizing Casparian strips are unknown. Here we identify and characterize a family of transmembrane proteins of previously unknown function. These 'CASPs' (Casparian strip membrane domain proteins) specifically mark a membrane domain that predicts the formation of Casparian strips. CASP1 displays numerous features required for a constituent of a plant junctional complex: it forms complexes with other CASPs; it becomes immobile upon localization; and it sediments like a large polymer. CASP double mutants display disorganized Casparian strips, demonstrating a role for CASPs in structuring and localizing this cell wall modification. To our knowledge, CASPs are the first molecular factors that are shown to establish a plasma membrane and extracellular diffusion barrier in plants, and represent a novel way of epithelial barrier formation in eukaryotes.","[Roppolo, Daniele; Tendon, Valerie Denervaud; Pfister, Alexandre; Alassimone, Julien; Vermeer, Joop E.

Recent efforts have focused on developing more potent TKIs that also inhibit mutant tyrosine kinases(4,5). However, even effective TKIs typically fail to eradicate leukaemia-initiating cells (LICs)(6-8), which often cause recurrence of leukaemia after initially successful treatment. Here we report the discovery of a novel mechanism of drug resistance, which is based on protective feedback signalling of leukaemia cells in response to treatment with TKI. We identify BCL6 as a central component of this drug-resistance pathway and demonstrate that targeted inhibition of BCL6 leads to eradication of drug-resistant and leukaemia-initiating subclones.","[Duy, Cihangir; Hurtz, Christian; Shojaee, Seyedmehdi; Swaminathan, Srividya; Klemm, Lars; Nahar, Rahul; Mueschen, Markus] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Lab Med, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Duy, Cihangir; Kweon, Soo-mi; Nahar, Rahul; Park, Eugene; Kim, Yong-mi; Heisterkamp, Nora; Mueschen, Markus] Univ So Calif, Dept Pediat, Childrens Hosp Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90027 USA; [Cerchietti, Leandro; Geng, Huimin; Melnick, Ari] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Med, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Cerchietti, Leandro; Geng, Huimin; Melnick, Ari] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Pharmacol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Braig, Melanie] Univ Klinikum Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Hematol & Oncol, Hamburg, Germany; [Hofmann, Wolf-Karsten] Univ Heidelberg, Klinikum Mannheim, Dept Hematol & Oncol, Mannheim, Germany; [Hurtz, Christian; Herzog, Sebastian; Jumaa, Hassan] Univ Freiburg, Fac Biol, BIOSS Ctr Biol Signalling Studies, Freiburg, Germany; [Hurtz, Christian; Herzog, Sebastian; Jumaa, Hassan] Max Planck Inst Immunobiol, Freiburg, Germany; [Koeffler, H.

Here we describe two novel and specific approaches to profile the genomic localization of 5hmC. The first approach, termed GLIB (glucosylation, periodate oxidation, biotinylation) uses a combination of enzymatic and chemical steps to isolate DNA fragments containing as few as a single 5hmC. The second approach involves conversion of 5hmC to cytosine 5-methylenesulphonate (CMS) by treatment of genomic DNA with sodium bisulphite, followed by immunoprecipitation of CMS-containing DNA with a specific antiserum to CMS5. High-throughput sequencing of 5hmC-containing DNA from mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells showed strong enrichment within exons and near transcriptional start sites. 5hmC was especially enriched at the start sites of genes whose promoters bear dual histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) marks. Our results indicate that 5hmC has a probable role in transcriptional regulation, and suggest a model in which 5hmC contributes to the 'poised' chromatin signature found at developmentally-regulated genes in ES cells.","[McLoughlin, Erin M.; Daley, George Q.; Agarwal, Suneet] Childrens Hosp, Div Hematol Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Pape, Utz J.; Liu, X.

The mammalian genome also contains 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), which seems to be generated by oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) by the TET family of enzymes that are highly expressed in embryonic stem(ES) cells(2-4). Here we use antibodies against 5hmC and 5mC together with high throughput sequencing to determine genome-wide patterns of methylation and hydroxymethylation in mouse wild-type and mutant ES cells and differentiating embryoid bodies. We find that 5hmC is mostly associated with euchromatin and that whereas 5mC is under-represented at gene promoters and CpG islands, 5hmC is enriched and is associated with increased transcriptional levels. Most, if not all, 5hmC in the genome depends on pre-existing 5mC and the balance between these two modifications is different between genomic regions. Knockdown of Tet1 and Tet2 causes downregulation of a group of genes that includes pluripotency-related genes (including Esrrb, Prdm14, Dppa3, Klf2, Tcl1 and Zfp42) and a concomitant increase in methylation of their promoters, together with an increased propensity of ES cells for extraembryonic lineage differentiation. Declining levels of TETs during differentiation are associated with decreased hydroxymethylation levels at the promoters of ES cell-specific genes together with increased methylation and gene silencing. We propose that the balance between hydroxymethylation and methylation in the genome is inextricably linked with the balance between pluripotency and lineage commitment.","[Ficz, Gabriella; Branco, Miguel R.; Seisenberger, Stefanie; Santos, Fatima; Hore, Timothy A.; Marques, C.

Although control theory offers mathematical tools for steering engineered and natural systems towards a desired state, a framework to control complex self-organized systems is lacking. Here we develop analytical tools to study the controllability of an arbitrary complex directed network, identifying the set of driver nodes with time-dependent control that can guide the system's entire dynamics. We apply these tools to several real networks, finding that the number of driver nodes is determined mainly by the network's degree distribution. We show that sparse inhomogeneous networks, which emerge in many real complex systems, are the most difficult to control, but that dense and homogeneous networks can be controlled using a few driver nodes. Counterintuitively, we find that in both model and real systems the driver nodes tend to avoid the high-degree nodes.","[Liu, Yang-Yu; Barabasi, Albert-Laszlo] Northeastern Univ, Ctr Complex Network Res, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Liu, Yang-Yu; Barabasi, Albert-Laszlo] Northeastern Univ, Dept Phys, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Liu, Yang-Yu; Barabasi, Albert-Laszlo] Northeastern Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Liu, Yang-Yu; Barabasi, Albert-Laszlo] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Ctr Canc Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Slotine, Jean-Jacques] MIT, Nonlinear Syst Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Slotine, Jean-Jacques] MIT, Dept Mech Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Slotine, Jean-Jacques] MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Barabasi, Albert-Laszlo] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Barabasi, AL (reprint author), Northeastern Univ, Ctr Complex Network Res, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",alb@neu.edu,,,"US Army Research Laboratory [W911NF-09-2-0053]; Office of Naval Research [N000141010968]; Defense Threat Reduction Agency [WMD BRBAA07-J-2-0035, BRBAA08-Per4-C-2-0033]; James S.

This indicates further the existence of a limited number of well-balanced host-microbial symbiotic states that might respond differently to diet and drug intake. The enterotypes are mostly driven by species composition, but abundant molecular functions are not necessarily provided by abundant species, highlighting the importance of a functional analysis to understand microbial communities. Although individual host properties such as body mass index, age, or gender cannot explain the observed enterotypes, data-driven marker genes or functional modules can be identified for each of these host properties. For example, twelve genes significantly correlate with age and three functional modules with the body mass index, hinting at a diagnostic potential of microbial markers.","[Arumugam, Manimozhiyan; Raes, Jeroen; Yamada, Takuji; Mende, Daniel R.; Fernandes, Gabriel R.; Tap, Julien; Bork, Peer] European Mol Biol Lab, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Raes, Jeroen] Vrije Univ Brussel VIB, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Pelletier, Eric; Le Paslier, Denis; Bruls, Thomas; Poulain, Julie; Ugarte, Edgardo; Weissenbach, Jean] CEA, F-91000 Evry, France; [Pelletier, Eric; Le Paslier, Denis; Bruls, Thomas; Weissenbach, Jean] CNRS, UMR8030, F-91000 Evry, France; [Pelletier, Eric; Le Paslier, Denis; Bruls, Thomas; Weissenbach, Jean] Univ Evry Val dEssone, F-91000 Evry, France; [Fernandes, Gabriel R.] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Dept Biochem & Immunol, BR-31270901 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Tap, Julien; Batto, Jean-Michel; Leclerc, Marion; Levenez, Florence; Pons, Nicolas; Dore, Joel; Ehrlich, S.

The Sec23p/Sec24p coat complex sorts the fusion machinery (SNAREs) into vesicles as they bud from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Vesicle tethering to the Golgi begins when the tethering factor TRAPPI binds to Sec23p. Where the coat is released and how this event relates to membrane fusion is unknown. Here we use a yeast transport assay to demonstrate that an ER-derived vesicle retains its coat until it reaches the Golgi. A Golgi-associated kinase, Hrr25p (CK1 delta orthologue), then phosphorylates the Sec23p/Sec24p complex. Coat phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are needed for vesicle fusion and budding, respectively. Additionally, we show that Sec23p interacts in a sequential manner with different binding partners, including TRAPPI and Hrr25p, to ensure the directionality of ER-Golgi traffic and prevent the back-fusion of a COPII vesicle with the ER.

Perturbations from a distant binary star companion(2,3) can produce high inclinations, but cannot explain orbits that are retrograde with respect to the total angular momentum of the system. Such orbits in a stellar context can be produced through secular (that is, long term) perturbations in hierarchical triple-star systems. Here we report a similar analysis of planetary bodies, including both octupole-order effects and tidal friction, and find that we can produce hot Jupiters in orbits that are retrograde with respect to the total angular momentum. With distant stellar mass perturbers, such an outcome is not possible(2,3). With planetary perturbers, the inner orbit's angular momentum component parallel to the total angular momentum need not be constant(4). In fact, as we show here, it can even change sign, leading to a retrograde orbit. A brief excursion to very high eccentricity during the chaotic evolution of the inner orbit allows planet-star tidal interactions to rapidly circularize that orbit, decoupling the planets and forming a retrograde hot Jupiter.","[Naoz, Smadar; Farr, Will M.; Lithwick, Yoram; Rasio, Frederic A.; Teyssandier, Jean] Northwestern Univ, CIERA, Evanston, IL 60208 USA","Naoz, S (reprint author), Northwestern Univ, CIERA, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",snaoz@northwestern.edu,,"Naoz, Smadar/0000-0002-9802-9279; Rasio, Frederic/0000-0002-7132-418X",Gruber Foundation; Weizmann Institute of Science; NSF MRI,We thank D.

The required optical quantum memory must be able to receive and recreate the photonic qubit; additionally, it must store an unknown quantum state of light better than any classical device. So far, these two requirements have been met only by ensembles of material particles that store the information in collective excitations(2-7). Recent developments, however, have paved the way for an approach in which the information exchange occurs between single quanta of light and matter(8-13). This single-particle approach allows the material qubit to be addressed, which has fundamental advantages for realistic implementations. First, it enables a heralding mechanism that signals the successful storage of a photon by means of state detection(14-16); this can be used to combat inevitable losses and finite efficiencies. Second, it allows for individual qubit manipulations, opening up avenues for in situ processing of the stored quantum information. Here we demonstrate the most fundamental implementation of such a quantum memory, by mapping arbitrary polarization states of light into and out of a single atom trapped inside an optical cavity. The memory performance is tested with weak coherent pulses and analysed using full quantum process tomography. The average fidelity is measured to be 93%, and low decoherence rates result in qubit coherence times exceeding 180 microseconds. This makes our system a versatile quantum node with excellent prospects for applications in optical quantum gates(17) and quantum repeaters(18).","[Specht, Holger P.; Nolleke, Christian; Reiserer, Andreas; Uphoff, Manuel; Figueroa, Eden; Ritter, Stephan; Rempe, Gerhard] Max Planck Inst Quantum Opt, D-85748 Garching, Germany","Ritter, S (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Quantum Opt, Hans Kopfermann Str 1, D-85748 Garching, Germany.",stephan.ritter@mpq.mpg.de,"Ritter, Stephan/F-1579-2010; Reiserer, Andreas/J-3243-2014; Reiserer, Andreas/G-4980-2017","Ritter, Stephan/0000-0001-9002-7407; Reiserer, Andreas/0000-0001-9595-7363; Reiserer, Andreas/0000-0001-9595-7363",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [635]; European Union; Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation,"We thank N.

It is believed that the ground state of some naturally occurring spin systems can be effectively attained through a process called quantum annealing(2,3). If it could be harnessed, quantum annealing might improve on known methods for solving certain types of problem(4,5). However, physical investigation of quantum annealing has been largely confined to microscopic spins in condensed-matter systems(6-12). Here we use quantum annealing to find the ground state of an artificial Ising spin system comprising an array of eight superconducting flux quantum bits with programmable spin-spin couplings. We observe a clear signature of quantum annealing, distinguishable from classical thermal annealing through the temperature dependence of the time at which the system dynamics freezes. Our implementation can be configured in situ to realize a wide variety of different spin networks, each of which can be monitored as it moves towards a low-energy configuration(13,14). This programmable artificial spin network bridges the gap between the theoretical study of ideal isolated spin networks and the experimental investigation of bulk magnetic samples. Moreover, with an increased number of spins, such a system may provide a practical physical means to implement a quantum algorithm, possibly allowing more-effective approaches to solving certain classes of hard combinatorial optimization problems.","[Johnson, M.

But this difference diminishes at high pressure, and the possibility that a melt sufficiently enriched in the heavy element iron might then become more dense than solids at the pressures in the interior of the Earth (and other terrestrial bodies) has long been a source of considerable speculation(1,2). The occurrence of such dense silicate melts in the Earth's lowermost mantle would carry important consequences for its physical and chemical evolution and could provide a unifying model for explaining a variety of observed features in the core-mantle boundary region(3). Recent theoretical calculations(4) combined with estimates of iron partitioning between (Mg,Fe)SiO3 perovskite and melt at shallower mantle conditions(5-7) suggest that melt is more dense than solids at pressures in the Earth's deepest mantle, consistent with analysis of shockwave experiments(8). Here we extend measurements of iron partitioning over the entire mantle pressure range, and find a precipitous change at pressures greater than similar to 76 GPa, resulting in strong iron enrichment in melts. Additional X-ray emission spectroscopy measurements on (Mg0.95Fe0.05)SiO3 glass indicate a spin collapse around 70 GPa, suggesting that the observed change in iron partitioning could be explained by a spin crossover of iron (from high-spin to low-spin) in silicate melt. These results imply that (Mg,Fe)SiO3 liquid becomes more dense than coexisting solid at similar to 1,800 km depth in the lower mantle. Soon after the Earth's formation, the heat dissipated by accretion and internal differentiation could have produced a dense melt layer up to similar to 1,000 km in thickness underneath the solid mantle. We also infer that (Mg,Fe)SiO3 perovskite is on the liquidus at deep mantle conditions, and predict that fractional crystallization of dense magma would have evolved towards an iron-rich and silicon-poor composition, consistent with seismic inferences of structures in the core-mantle boundary region.","[Nomura, Ryuichi; Ozawa, Haruka; Tateno, Shigehiko; Hirose, Kei] Tokyo Inst Technol, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1528551, Japan; [Nomura, Ryuichi] Univ Tokyo, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Ozawa, Haruka; Hirose, Kei] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Inst Res Earth Evolut, Yokosuka, Kanagawa 2370061, Japan; [Hernlund, John] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Muto, Shunsuke] Nagoya Univ, Dept Mat Phys & Energy Engn, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648603, Japan; [Ishii, Hirofumi; Hiraoka, Nozomu] Natl Synchrotron Radiat Res Ctr, Hsinchu 30076, Taiwan","Hirose, K (reprint author), Tokyo Inst Technol, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1528551, Japan.",kei@geo.titech.ac.jp,"Tateno, Shigehiko/D-4640-2011; Hernlund, John/A-8931-2014; Tateno, Haruka/N-7018-2014; Nomura, Ryuichi/B-9625-2015; Hirose, Kei/C-2165-2009","Hernlund, John/0000-0003-1008-0182; Tateno, Haruka/0000-0002-1173-4021; Nomura, Ryuichi/0000-0003-4808-3709; Hirose, Kei/0000-0003-4366-7721",National Science Foundation [NSFEAR0855737],"We thank R.

The diatom nuclear genome contains genes with bacterial and plastid origins as well as genes of the secondary endosymbiotic host (the exosymbiont(5))(1,6-10), yet little is known about the relative contribution of each gene group to diatom metabolism. Here we show that the exosymbiont-derived ornithine-urea cycle, which is similar to that of metazoans but is absent in green algae and plants, facilitates rapid recovery from prolonged nitrogen limitation. RNA-interference-mediated knockdown of a mitochondrial carbamoyl phosphate synthase impairs the response of nitrogen-limited diatoms to nitrogen addition. Metabolomic analyses indicate that intermediates in the ornithine-urea cycle are particularly depleted and that both the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the glutamine synthetase/glutamate synthase cycles are linked directly with the ornithine-urea cycle. Several other depleted metabolites are generated from ornithine-urea cycle intermediates by the products of genes laterally acquired from bacteria. This metabolic coupling of bacterial-and exosymbiont-derived proteins seems to be fundamental to diatom physiology because the compounds affected include the major diatom osmolyte proline(12) and the precursors for long-chain polyamines required for silica precipitation during cell wall formation(11). So far, the ornithine-urea cycle is only known for its essential role in the removal of fixed nitrogen in metazoans. In diatoms, this cycle serves as a distribution and repackaging hub for inorganic carbon and nitrogen and contributes significantly to the metabolic response of diatoms to episodic nitrogen availability. The diatom ornithine-urea cycle therefore represents a key pathway for anaplerotic carbon fixation into nitrogenous compounds that are essential for diatom growth and for the contribution of diatoms to marine productivity.","[Allen, Andrew E.; Dupont, Christopher L.; McCrow, John P.; Zheng, Hong; Johnson, Daniel A.] J Craig Venter Inst, San Diego, CA 92121 USA; [Allen, Andrew E.; Hu, Hanhua; Bowler, Chris] Ecole Normale Super, Inst Biol, Environm & Evolutionary Genom Sect, CNRS,UMR8197,INSERM,U1024, F-75005 Paris, France; [Obornik, Miroslav; Horak, Ales] Biol Ctr ASCR, Inst Parasitol, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic; [Obornik, Miroslav; Horak, Ales] Univ S Bohemia, Fac Sci, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic; [Nunes-Nesi, Adriano; Fernie, Alisdair R.] Max Planck Insitut Mol Pfanzenphysiol, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany","Allen, AE (reprint author), J Craig Venter Inst, San Diego, CA 92121 USA.",aallen@jcvi.org,"Horak, Ales/H-6723-2012; Nunes-Nesi, Adriano/D-6430-2013; Obornik, Miroslav/G-9350-2014","Bowler, Chris/0000-0003-3835-6187","National Science Foundation [NSF-OCE-0722374, NSF-OCE-0727997, NSF-MCB-1024913]; JCVI; European Commission; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (France); Czech Science Foundation [206/08/1423]","We thank A.

This pathway releases methanethiol (MeSH) instead of the climatically active gas dimethylsulphide (DMS) and enables marine microorganisms to assimilate the reduced sulphur(5-7). Despite recognition of this critical microbial transformation for over two decades, the biochemical pathway and enzymes responsible have remained unidentified. Here we show that three new enzymes related to fatty acid beta-oxidation constitute the pathway that assimilates methylmercaptopropionate (MMPA), the first product of DMSP demethylation/demethiolation, and that two previously unknown coenzyme A (CoA) derivatives, 3-methylmercaptopropionyl-CoA (MMPA-CoA) and methylthioacryloyl-CoA (MTA-CoA), are formed as novel intermediates. A member of the marine roseobacters, Ruegeria pomeroyi DSS-3, requires the MMPA-CoA pathway for MMPA assimilation and MeSH production. This pathway and the ability to produce MeSH from MMPA are present in diverse bacteria, and the ubiquitous SAR11 clade bacterium Pelagibacter ubique possesses enzymes for at least the first two steps. Analysis of marine metagenomic data indicates that the pathway is widespread among bacterioplankton in the ocean surface waters, making it one of the most important known routes for acquisition of reduced carbon and sulphur by surface ocean heterotrophs.","[Reisch, Chris R.; Varaljay, Vanessa A.; Whitman, William B.] Univ Georgia, Dept Microbiol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Moran, Mary Ann] Univ Georgia, Dept Marine Sci, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Stoudemayer, Melissa J.; Amster, I.

The development of genetically engineered malaria-resistant mosquitoes has shown, as a proof of principle, the possibility of targeting the mosquito's ability to serve as a disease vector(4-7). The translation of these achievements into control measures requires an effective technology to spread a genetic modification from laboratory mosquitoes to field populations(8). We have suggested previously that homing endonuclease genes (HEGs), a class of simple selfish genetic elements, could be exploited for this purpose(9). Here we demonstrate that a synthetic genetic element, consisting of mosquito regulatory regions(10) and the homing endonuclease gene I-SceI(11-13), can substantially increase its transmission to the progeny in transgenic mosquitoes of the human malaria vector Anopheles gambiae. We show that the I-SceI element is able to invade receptive mosquito cage populations rapidly, validating mathematical models for the transmission dynamics of HEGs. Molecular analyses confirm that expression of I-SceI in the male germline induces high rates of site-specific chromosomal cleavage and gene conversion, which results in the gain of the I-SceI gene, and underlies the observed genetic drive. These findings demonstrate a new mechanism by which genetic control measures can be implemented. Our results also show in principle how sequence-specific genetic drive elements like HEGs could be used to take the step from the genetic engineering of individuals to the genetic engineering of populations.","[Windbichler, Nikolai; Menichelli, Miriam; Papathanos, Philippos Aris; Burt, Austin; Crisanti, Andrea] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Life Sci, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Thyme, Summer B.; Baker, David] Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Thyme, Summer B.; Baker, David] Univ Washington, Grad Program Biomol Struct & Design, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Li, Hui; Ulge, Umut Y.; Monnat, Raymond J., Jr.] Univ Washington, Dept Pathol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Ulge, Umut Y.; Monnat, Raymond J., Jr.] Univ Washington, Grad Program Mol & Cellular Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Hovde, Blake T.; Monnat, Raymond J., Jr.] Univ Washington, Dept Genome Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Baker, David] Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Burt, Austin] Imperial Coll London, Dept Life Sci, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; [Crisanti, Andrea] Univ Perugia, Dept Expt Med, I-06122 Perugia, Italy","Crisanti, A (reprint author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Life Sci, S Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, England.",a.drcrisanti@imperial.ac.uk,"Li, Hui/E-8866-2010; Baker, David/K-8941-2012","Baker, David/0000-0001-7896-6217; Windbichler, Nikolai/0000-0001-9896-1165; Li, Hui/0000-0002-2980-2491; Ulge, Umut/0000-0002-3745-0668","Foundation for the National Institutes of Health through Grand Challenges in Global Health initiative; NIH [GM084433, CA133831]","We thank M.

Bacterial persisters have been implicated in biofilms and in chronic and recurrent infections(5-7). Despite this clinical relevance, there are currently no viable means for eradicating persisters. Here we show that specific metabolic stimuli enable the killing of both Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) persisters with aminoglycosides. This potentiation is aminoglycoside-specific, it does not rely on growth resumption and it is effective in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. It proceeds by the generation of a proton-motive force which facilitates aminoglycoside uptake. Our results demonstrate that persisters, although dormant, are primed for metabolite uptake, central metabolism and respiration. We show that aminoglycosides can be used in combination with specific metabolites to treat E. coli and S. aureus biofilms. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this approach can improve the treatment of chronic infections in a mouse urinary tract infection model. This work establishes a strategy for eradicating bacterial persisters that is based on metabolism, and highlights the importance of the metabolic environment to antibiotic treatment.","[Allison, Kyle R.; Brynildsen, Mark P.; Collins, James J.] Boston Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biomed Engn, Ctr Biodynam, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Collins, James J.] Boston Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02118 USA; [Collins, James J.] Harvard Univ, Wyss Inst Biol Inspired Engn, Boston, MA 02118 USA","Collins, JJ (reprint author), Boston Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biomed Engn, Ctr Biodynam, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",jcollins@bu.edu,,,NIH; Howard Hughes Medical Institute,We thank A.

To elucidate the cellular and molecular defects of SCZD, we directly reprogrammed fibroblasts from SCZD patients into human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and subsequently differentiated these disorder-specific hiPSCs into neurons (Supplementary Fig. 1). SCZD hiPSC neurons showed diminished neuronal connectivity in conjunction with decreased neurite number, PSD95-protein levels and glutamate receptor expression. Gene expression profiles of SCZD hiPSC neurons identified altered expression of many components of the cyclic AMP and WNT signalling pathways. Key cellular and molecular elements of the SCZD phenotype were ameliorated following treatment of SCZD hiPSC neurons with the antipsychotic loxapine. To date, hiPSC neuronal pathology has only been demonstrated in diseases characterized by both the loss of function of a single gene product and rapid disease progression in early childhood(4-6).

Studies of the genetic requirements for lifespan extension by dietary restriction in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans have implicated a number of key molecules in this process(3-5), including the nutrient-sensing target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway(6) and the Foxa transcription factor PHA-4 (ref. 7). However, little is known about the metabolic signals that coordinate the organismal response to dietary restriction and maintain homeostasis when nutrients are limited. The endocannabinoid system is an excellent candidate for such a role given its involvement in regulating nutrient intake and energy balance(8). Despite this, a direct role for endocannabinoid signalling in dietary restriction or lifespan determination has yet to be demonstrated, in part due to the apparent absence of endocannabinoid signalling pathways in model organisms that are amenable to lifespan analysis(9). N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) are lipid-derived signalling molecules, which include the mammalian endocannabinoid arachidonoyl ethanolamide. Here we identify NAEs in C. elegans, show that NAE abundance is reduced under dietary restriction and that NAE deficiency is sufficient to extend lifespan through a dietary restriction mechanism requiring PHA-4. Conversely, dietary supplementation with the nematode NAE eicosapentaenoyl ethanolamide not only inhibits dietary-restriction-induced lifespan extension in wild-type worms, but also suppresses lifespan extension in a TOR pathway mutant. This demonstrates a role for NAE signalling in ageing and indicates that NAEs represent a signal that coordinates nutrient status with metabolic changes that ultimately determine lifespan.","[Lucanic, Mark; Held, Jason M.; Vantipalli, Maithili C.; Klang, Ida M.; Graham, Jill B.; Gibson, Bradford W.; Lithgow, Gordon J.; Gill, Matthew S.] Buck Inst Res Aging, Novato, CA 94945 USA; [Klang, Ida M.] Karolinska Inst, Ctr Biosci, Novum, Dept Biosci & Nutr, S-14183 Huddinge, Sweden","Gill, MS (reprint author), Scripps Res Inst Scripps Florida, 130 Scripps Way,3B3, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA.",mgill@scripps.edu,,"Held, Jason/0000-0001-8024-2736","NIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR); NIH [T32 AG000266, R01 AG029631, PL1-AG032118, UL1 DE019608, R21 AG030192, R01 AG036992]; Larry L.

Its activity is controlled by the multisubunit gamma-secretase (gamma SE) complex(2). Although Notch signalling can play both oncogenic and tumour-suppressor roles in solid tumours, in the haematopoietic system it is exclusively oncogenic, notably in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, a disease characterized by Notch1-activating mutations(3). Here we identify novel somatic-inactivating Notch pathway mutations in a fraction of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML). Inactivation of Notch signalling in mouse haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) results in an aberrant accumulation of granulocyte/monocyte progenitors (GMPs), extramedullary haematopoieisis and the induction of CMML-like disease. Transcriptome analysis revealed that Notch signalling regulates an extensive myelomonocytic-specific gene signature, through the direct suppression of gene transcription by the Notch target Hes1. Our studies identify a novel role for Notch signalling during early haematopoietic stem cell differentiation and suggest that the Notch pathway can play both tumour-promoting and -suppressive roles within the same tissue.","[Lobry, Camille; Oh, Philmo; Buonamici, Silvia; Cathelin, Severine; Trimarchi, Thomas; Araldi, Elisa; Liu, Cynthia; Ibrahim, Sherif; Aifantis, Iannis] NYU, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Lobry, Camille; Oh, Philmo; Buonamici, Silvia; Cathelin, Severine; Trimarchi, Thomas; Araldi, Elisa; Liu, Cynthia; Ibrahim, Sherif; Aifantis, Iannis] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Klinakis, Apostolos; Efstratiadis, Argiris] Acad Athens, Biomed Res Fdn, Athens, Greece; [Abdel-Wahab, Omar; Levine, Ross L.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Med, Human Oncol & Pathogenesis Program, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Abdel-Wahab, Omar; Levine, Ross L.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Med, Leukemia Serv, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Haeno, Hiroshi; Michor, Franziska] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Biostat & Computat Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Haeno, Hiroshi; Michor, Franziska] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [van De Walle, Inge; Taghon, Tom] Univ Ghent, State Univ Ghent Hosp, Dept Clin Chem Microbiol & Immunol, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Beran, Miroslav] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Leukemia, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Zavadil, Jiri] NYU Canc Inst, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Zavadil, Jiri] NYU Langone Med Ctr, Ctr Hlth Informat & Bioinformat, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Buonamici, Silvia] Novartis Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Aifantis, I (reprint author), NYU, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10016 USA.",aklinakis@bioacademy.gr; iannis.aifantis@nyumc.org,"lobry, camille/A-6188-2015","lobry, camille/0000-0003-0550-4921; Abdel-Wahab, Omar/0000-0002-3907-6171; Zavadil, Jiri/0000-0003-0640-5562","National Institutes of Health [RO1CA133379, RO1CA105129, R21CA141399, RO1CA149655, R01CA1328234, U54CA143798]; Leukemia & Lymphoma Society; American Cancer Society; Irma T.

Although subtle alterations in Notch activity suffice to elicit profound differences in endothelial behaviour and blood vessel formation(2,3), little is known about the regulation and adaptation of endothelial Notch responses. Here we report that the NAD1-dependent deacetylase SIRT1 acts as an intrinsic negative modulator of Notch signalling in endothelial cells. We show that acetylation of the Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD) on conserved lysines controls the amplitude and duration of Notch responses by altering NICD protein turnover. SIRT1 associates with NICD and functions as a NICD deacetylase, which opposes the acetylation-induced NICD stabilization. Consequently, endothelial cells lacking SIRT1 activity are sensitized to Notch signalling, resulting in impaired growth, sprout elongation and enhanced Notch target gene expression in response to DLL4 stimulation, thereby promoting a non-sprouting, stalk-cell-like phenotype. In vivo, inactivation of Sirt1 in zebrafish and mice causes reduced vascular branching and density as a consequence of enhanced Notch signalling. Our findings identify reversible acetylation of the NICD as a molecular mechanism to adapt the dynamics of Notch signalling, and indicate that SIRT1 acts as rheostat to fine-tune endothelial Notch responses.","[Guarani, Virginia; Zimmermann, Barbara; Dimmeler, Stefanie] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Ctr Mol Med, Inst Cardiovasc Regenerat, D-60590 Frankfurt, Germany; [Deflorian, Gianluca; Mione, Marina] FIRC Inst Mol Oncol, IFOM, I-20139 Milan, Italy; [Franco, Claudio A.; Phng, Li-Kun; Bentley, Katie; Gerhardt, Holger] London Res Inst Canc Res UK, Vasc Biol Lab, London WC2A 3LY, England; [Krueger, Marcus; Braun, Thomas] Max Planck Inst Heart & Lung Res, Dept Cardiac Dev & Remodeling, D-61231 Bad Nauheim, Germany; [Toussaint, Louise; Dequiedt, Franck] GxABT, Lab Prot Signaling & Interact, B-5030 Gembloux, Belgium; [Toussaint, Louise; Dequiedt, Franck] Univ Liege, Interdisciplinary Cluster Appl Genoprote GIGA R, B-4000 Sart Tilman Par Liege, Belgium; [Mostoslavsky, Raul] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Canc, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Schmidt, Mirko H.

The channel has an hourglass shape with a narrow constriction approximately halfway across the membrane, formed by a pore ring of amino acids(2). While the cytoplasmic cavity of the channel is empty, the extracellular cavity is filled with a short helix called the plug(2), which moves out of the way during protein translocation(3,4). The mechanism by which the channel transports large polypeptides and yet prevents the passage of small molecules, such as ions or metabolites, has been controversial(2,5-8). Here, we have addressed this issue in intact Escherichia coli cells by testing the permeation of small molecules through wild-type and mutant SecY channels, which are either in the resting state or contain a defined translocating polypeptide chain. We show that in the resting state, the channel is sealed by both the pore ring and the plug domain. During translocation, the pore ring forms a 'gasket-like' seal around the polypeptide chain, preventing the permeation of small molecules. The structural conservation of the channel in all organisms indicates that this may be a universal mechanism by which the membrane barrier is maintained during protein translocation.","[Park, Eunyong; Rapoport, Tom A.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Park, Eunyong; Rapoport, Tom A.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Rapoport, TA (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, 240 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",tom_rapoport@hms.harvard.edu,,,NIH [GM052586],"We thank P.

The approach is especially well suited to the characterization of non-coding portions of the genome, which critically contribute to cellular phenotypes yet remain largely uncharted. Here we map nine chromatin marks across nine cell types to systematically characterize regulatory elements, their cell-type specificities and their functional interactions. Focusing on cell-type-specific patterns of promoters and enhancers, we define multicell activity profiles for chromatin state, gene expression, regulatory motif enrichment and regulator expression. We use correlations between these profiles to link enhancers to putative target genes, and predict the cell-type-specific activators and repressors that modulate them. The resulting annotations and regulatory predictions have implications for the interpretation of genome-wide association studies. Top-scoring disease single nucleotide polymorphisms are frequently positioned within enhancer elements specifically active in relevant cell types, and in some cases affect a motif instance for a predicted regulator, thus suggesting a mechanism for the association. Our study presents a general framework for deciphering cis-regulatory connections and their roles in disease.","[Ernst, Jason; Kheradpour, Pouya; Mikkelsen, Tarjei S.; Shoresh, Noam; Ward, Lucas D.; Epstein, Charles B.; Zhang, Xiaolan; Wang, Li; Issner, Robbyn; Coyne, Michael; Ku, Manching; Durham, Timothy; Kellis, Manolis; Bernstein, Bradley E.] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Ernst, Jason; Kheradpour, Pouya; Ward, Lucas D.; Kellis, Manolis] MIT, Comp Sci & Artificial Intelligence Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Ku, Manching; Bernstein, Bradley E.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Pathol, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Ku, Manching; Bernstein, Bradley E.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Ku, Manching; Bernstein, Bradley E.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Ku, Manching; Bernstein, Bradley E.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Canc Res, Boston, MA 02114 USA","Kellis, M (reprint author), Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",manoli@mit.edu,"Mikkelsen, Tarjei/A-1306-2007","Mikkelsen, Tarjei/0000-0002-8133-3135; Ward, Lucas/0000-0002-8017-809X","National Human Genome Research Institute [U54 HG004570, R01 HG004037, RC1 HG005334]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; National Science Foundation [0644282, 0905968]; Sloan Foundation","We thank members of the epigenomics community at the Broad Institute and the Bernstein and Kellis laboratories, and M.

Here we present the crystal structure of an EIIC from Bacillus cereus that transports diacetylchitobiose. The EIIC is a homodimer, with an expansive interface formed between the amino-terminal halves of the two protomers. The carboxy-terminal half of each protomer has a large binding pocket that contains a diacetylchitobiose, which is occluded from both sides of the membrane with its site of phosphorylation near the conserved His 250 and Glu 334 residues.

We found that five oxygen atoms served as oxo bridges linking the five metal atoms, and that four water molecules were bound to the Mn(4)CaO(5) cluster; some of them may therefore serve as substrates for dioxygen formation. We identified more than 1,300 water molecules in each photosystem II monomer.

All the lock-in operations-modulation, detection and mixing-are performed through the application of non-commuting quantum operators to the electronic spin state of a single, trapped Sr(+) ion. We significantly increase its sensitivity to external fields while extending phase coherence by three orders of magnitude, to more than one second. Using this technique, we measure frequency shifts with a sensitivity of 0.42 Hz Hz(-1/2) (corresponding to a magnetic field measurement sensitivity of 15 pT Hz(-1/2)), obtaining an uncertainty of less than 10 mHz (350 fT) after 3,720 seconds of averaging. These sensitivities are limited by quantum projection noise and improve on other single-spin probe technologies(2,3) by two orders of magnitude. Our reported sensitivity is sufficient for the measurement of parity non-conservation(4), as well as the detection of the magnetic field of a single electronic spin one micrometre from an ion detector with nanometre resolution. As a first application, we perform light shift spectroscopy of a narrow optical quadrupole transition. Finally, we emphasize that the quantum lock-in technique is generic and can potentially enhance the sensitivity of any quantum sensor.","[Kotler, Shlomi; Akerman, Nitzan; Glickman, Yinnon; Keselman, Anna; Ozeri, Roee] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Phys Complex Syst, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel","Kotler, S (reprint author), Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Phys Complex Syst, POB 26, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel.",shlomi.kotler@weizmann.ac.il,"Kotler, Shlomi/I-4393-2014","Kotler, Shlomi/0000-0002-0191-5777",ISF; Crown Photonics Center; Minerva Foundation,"We thank G.

Although these devices can be very reliable and compact, the thermoelectric materials themselves are relatively inefficient: to facilitate widespread application, it will be desirable to identify or develop materials that have an intensive thermoelectric materials figure of merit, zT, above 1.5 (ref. 1). Many different concepts have been used in the search for new materials with high thermoelectric efficiency, such as the use of nanostructuring to reduce phonon thermal conductivity(2-4), which has led to the investigation of a variety of complex material systems(5). In this vein, it is well known(6,7) that a high valley degeneracy (typically <= 6 for known thermoelectrics) in the electronic bands is conducive to high zT, and this in turn has stimulated attempts to engineer such degeneracy by adopting low-dimensional nanostructures(8-10). Here we demonstrate that it is possible to direct the convergence of many valleys in a bulk material by tuning the doping and composition. By this route, we achieve a convergence of at least 12 valleys in doped PbTe(1-x)Se(x) alloys, leading to an extraordinary zT value of 1.8 at about 850 kelvin. Band engineering to converge the valence (or conduction) bands to achieve high valley degeneracy should be a general strategy in the search for and improvement of bulk thermoelectric materials, because it simultaneously leads to a high Seebeck coefficient and high electrical conductivity.","[Pei, Yanzhong; LaLonde, Aaron; Wang, Heng; Snyder, G.

For example, chemical diffusion, which is the transport of matter associated with chemical concentration gradients (Fick's law), is treated as a separate process from thermal transport (the Soret effect), which is mass transport induced by temperature gradients. In the past few years, large variations in the proportions of isotopes of Mg, Ca, Fe, Si and O found in silicate melts subject to thermal gradients have been found(1-3), but no physical mechanism has been proposed. Here we present a model of diffusion in natural condensed systems that explains both the chemical and isotopic fractionation of Mg, Ca and Fe in high-temperature geochemical melts. Despite the high temperatures associated with these melts (T > 1,000 degrees C), we find that consideration of the quantum-mechanical zero-point energy of diffusing species is essential for understanding diffusion at the isotopic level. Our model explains thermal and chemical mass transport as manifestations of the same underlying diffusion mechanism. This work promises to provide insights into mass-transport phenomena (diffusion and evaporation) and associated isotopic fractionations in a wide range of natural condensed systems, including the atmospheric water cycle(1,2), geological and geochemical systems(3-6) and the early Solar System(4). This work might also be relevant to studies of mass transport in biological(7,8) and nanotechnological condensed systems(9).","[Dominguez, Gerardo; Thiemens, Mark H.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Chem & Biochem, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Wilkins, Gautam] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Math, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Dominguez, G (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Chem & Biochem, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",gdominguez@ucsd.edu,,,"University of California; NASA [NNX07AM66G, NNX08AI15G]","We thank Frank Richter for introducing us to this problem.

Significant discrepancies are observed at 'type I' margins (such as the Iberia-Newfoundland conjugates), where large tracts of continental mantle lithosphere are exposed at the sea floor(4), and 'type II' margins (such as some ultrawide central South Atlantic margins), where thin continental crust spans wide regions below which continental lower crust and mantle lithosphere have apparently been removed(5,6). Neither corresponds to uniform extension. Instead, either crust or mantle lithosphere has been preferentially removed. Using dynamical models, we demonstrate that these margins are opposite end members: in type I, depth-dependent extension results in crustal-necking breakup before mantle-lithosphere breakup and in type II, the converse is true. These two-layer, two-stage breakup behaviours explain the discrepancies and have implications for the styles of the associated sedimentary basins. Laterally flowing lower-mantle cratonic lithosphere may underplate some type II margins, thereby contributing to their anomalous characteristics.","[Huismans, Ritske] Univ Bergen, Dept Earth Sci, N-5007 Bergen, Norway; [Beaumont, Christopher] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Oceanog, Halifax, NS B3H 4J1, Canada","Huismans, R (reprint author), Univ Bergen, Dept Earth Sci, N-5007 Bergen, Norway.",ritske.huismans@geo.uib.no,"Huismans, Ritske/C-3938-2013",,"Department of Earth Science, University of Bergen, Norway; Canada Research Chair in Geodynamics","R.H. acknowledges support of the Department of Earth Science, University of Bergen, Norway.

The central goal of linguistics is to describe the diversity of human languages and explain the constraints on that diversity. Generative linguists following Chomsky have claimed that linguistic diversity must be constrained by innate parameters that are set as a child learns a language(1,2). In contrast, other linguists following Greenberg have claimed that there are statistical tendencies for co-occurrence of traits reflecting universal systems biases(3-5), rather than absolute constraints or parametric variation. Here we use computational phylogenetic methods to address the nature of constraints on linguistic diversity in an evolutionary framework(6). First, contrary to the generative account of parameter setting, we show that the evolution of only a few word-order features of languages are strongly correlated. Second, contrary to the Greenbergian generalizations, we show that most observed functional dependencies between traits are lineage-specific rather than universal tendencies. These findings support the view that-at least with respect to word order-cultural evolution is the primary factor that determines linguistic structure, with the current state of a linguistic system shaping and constraining future states.","[Dunn, Michael; Levinson, Stephen C.] Max Planck Inst Psycholinguist, NL-6500 AH Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Dunn, Michael; Levinson, Stephen C.] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Donders Inst Brain Cognit & Behav, NL-6525 EN Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Greenhill, Simon J.; Gray, Russell D.] Univ Auckland, Dept Psychol, Auckland 1142, New Zealand; [Greenhill, Simon J.] Univ Auckland, Computat Evolut Grp, Auckland 1142, New Zealand","Dunn, M (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Psycholinguist, POB 310, NL-6500 AH Nijmegen, Netherlands.",michael.dunn@mpi.nl,"Dunn, Michael/F-1077-2012; Gray, Russell /H-2078-2015; Greenhill, Simon/B-3114-2011","Dunn, Michael/0000-0001-5349-5252; Gray, Russell /0000-0002-9858-0191; Greenhill, Simon/0000-0001-7832-6156",,,,29,138,138,10,64,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,5-May,2011,473,7345,,,,,79,82,,10.1038/nature09923,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,759CQ,WOS:000290218300034,21490599.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,russell d.,gray,na,na,na,na,na

In contrast, the addition of new features is extremely rare and is thought to be heavily constrained, although the nature of the constraints remains elusive(2-4). Here we show that the treehopper (Membracidae) 'helmet' is actually an appendage, a wing serial homologue on the first thoracic segment. This innovation in the insect body plan is an unprecedented situation in 250 Myr of insect evolution. We provide evidence suggesting that the helmet arose by escaping the ancestral repression of wing formation imparted by a member of the Hox gene family, which sculpts the number and pattern of appendages along the body axis(5-8). Moreover, we propose that the exceptional morphological diversification of the helmet was possible because, in contrast to the wings, it escaped the stringent functional requirements imposed by flight. This example illustrates how complex morphological structures can arise by the expression of ancestral developmental potentials and fuel the morphological diversification of an evolutionary lineage.","[Prud'homme, Benjamin; Minervino, Caroline; Hocine, Melanie; Cande, Jessica D.; Aouane, Aicha; Gompel, Nicolas] CNRS, UMR 6216, Inst Biol Dev Marseille Luminy, F-13288 Marseille 9, France; [Dufour, Heloise D.; Kassner, Victoria A.] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Dufour, Heloise D.; Kassner, Victoria A.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Bock Labs, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Prud'homme, B (reprint author), CNRS, UMR 6216, Inst Biol Dev Marseille Luminy, Case 907,Parc Sci Luminy, F-13288 Marseille 9, France.",benjamin.prudhomme@univmed.fr; nicolas.gompel@univmed.fr,,,EURYI award; Human Frontier Science Program; CNRS,"We are grateful to G.

Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of sensory processing requires uncovering how connection patterns between neurons relate to their function. On a coarse scale, long-range projections can preferentially link cortical regions with similar responses to sensory stimuli(1-4). But on the local scale, where dendrites and axons overlap substantially, the functional specificity of connections remains unknown. Here we determine synaptic connectivity between nearby layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in vitro, the response properties of which were first characterized in mouse visual cortex in vivo. We found that connection probability was related to the similarity of visually driven neuronal activity. Neurons with the same preference for oriented stimuli connected at twice the rate of neurons with orthogonal orientation preferences. Neurons responding similarly to naturalistic stimuli formed connections at much higher rates than those with uncorrelated responses. Bidirectional synaptic connections were found more frequently between neuronal pairs with strongly correlated visual responses. Our results reveal the degree of functional specificity of local synaptic connections in the visual cortex, and point to the existence of fine-scale subnetworks dedicated to processing related sensory information.","[Ko, Ho; Hofer, Sonja B.; Pichler, Bruno; Buchanan, Katherine A.; Sjoestroem, P.

Here we report that phosphorylation of DISC1, a major susceptibility factor for several mental disorders, acts as a molecular switch from maintaining proliferation of mitotic progenitor cells to activating migration of postmitotic neurons in mice. Unphosphorylated DISC1 regulates canonical Wnt signalling via an interaction with GSK3 beta, whereas specific phosphorylation at serine 710 (S710) triggers the recruitment of Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) proteins to the centrosome. In support of this model, loss of BBS1 leads to defects in migration, but not proliferation, whereas DISC1 knockdown leads to deficits in both. A phospho-dead mutant can only rescue proliferation, whereas a phospho-mimic mutant rescues exclusively migration defects. These data highlight a dual role for DISC1 in corticogenesis and indicate that phosphorylation of this protein at S710 activates a key developmental switch.","[Ishizuka, Koko; Kamiya, Atsushi; Seshadri, Saurav; Furukori, Keiko; Huang, Beverly; Zeledon, Mariela; Hayashi-Takagi, Akiko; Sawa, Akira] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA; [Oh, Edwin C.; Robinson, Jon F.; Katsanis, Nicholas] Duke Univ, Ctr Human Dis Modeling, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Oh, Edwin C.; Robinson, Jon F.; Katsanis, Nicholas] Duke Univ, Dept Cell Biol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Oh, Edwin C.; Robinson, Jon F.; Katsanis, Nicholas] Duke Univ, Dept Pediat, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Kanki, Hiroaki; Okano, Hideyuki] Keio Univ, Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Tokyo 1608582, Japan; [Kubo, Ken-ichiro; Nakajima, Kazunori] Keio Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat, Tokyo 1608582, Japan; [Murdoch, Hannah; Dunlop, Allan J.; Houslay, Miles D.] Univ Glasgow, CMVLS, Inst Neurosci & Psychol, Mol Pharmacol Grp, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Sawa, Akira] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA","Sawa, A (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA.",katsanis@cellbio.duke.edu; asawa1@jhmi.edu,"Houslay, Miles/A-6825-2011; Katsanis, Nicholas/E-1837-2012; Hidokano, Hideyuki/J-5973-2013; Kubo, Ken-ichiro/B-2520-2015; Nakajima, Kazunori/L-3396-2013; kamiya, atsushi/L-8550-2016","Kubo, Ken-ichiro/0000-0003-4023-5069; Nakajima, Kazunori/0000-0003-1864-9425; Houslay, Miles/0000-0002-3826-8091; Katsanis, Nicholas/0000-0002-2480-0171","USPHS [MH-084018, MH-069853, MH-085226, MH-088753, MH-091230, HD-04260, DK-072301, DK-075972]; Stanley foundation; RUSK foundation; Maryland Stem Cell Research Fund; NARSAD; Macular Vision Research Foundation; Foundation for Fighting Blindness; Health Labor Sciences; MEXT; Takeda; PMAC-PSJ; Fight for Sight Postdoctoral Fellowship; Medical Research Council, UK [G0600765]; Strategic Research Program for Brain Sciences","We thank Y.

The success of angiosperms has been attributed, in part, to innovations associated with gene or whole-genome duplications(4-6), but evidence for proposed ancient genome duplications pre-dating the divergence of monocots and eudicots remains equivocal in analyses of conserved gene order. Here we use comprehensive phylogenomic analyses of sequenced plant genomes and more than 12.6 million new expressed-sequence-tag sequences from phylogenetically pivotal lineages to elucidate two groups of ancient gene duplications-one in the common ancestor of extant seed plants and the other in the common ancestor of extant angiosperms. Gene duplication events were intensely concentrated around 319 and 192 million years ago, implicating two WGDs in ancestral lineages shortly before the diversification of extant seed plants and extant angiosperms, respectively. Significantly, these ancestral WGDs resulted in the diversification of regulatory genes important to seed and flower development, suggesting that they were involved in major innovations that ultimately contributed to the rise and eventual dominance of seed plants and angiosperms.","[Jiao, Yuannian; Ma, Hong; dePamphilis, Claude W.] Penn State Univ, Intercoll Grad Degree Program Plant Biol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Jiao, Yuannian; Wickett, Norman J.; Landherr, Lena; Ralph, Paula E.; Hu, Yi; Ma, Hong; dePamphilis, Claude W.] Penn State Univ, Inst Mol Evolutionary Genet, Dept Biol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Jiao, Yuannian; Wickett, Norman J.; Landherr, Lena; Ralph, Paula E.; Hu, Yi; Ma, Hong; dePamphilis, Claude W.] Penn State Univ, Huck Inst Life Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Ayyampalayam, Saravanaraj; Leebens-Mack, Jim] Univ Georgia, Dept Plant Biol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Chanderbali, Andre S.; Soltis, Douglas E.] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Tomsho, Lynn P.; Schuster, Stephan C.] Penn State Univ, Ctr Infect Dis Dynam, Ctr Comparat Genom, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Liang, Haiying] Clemson Univ, Dept Biochem & Genet, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; [Soltis, Pamela S.] Univ Florida, Florida Museum Nat Hist, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Clifton, Sandra W.] Washington Univ, Genome Ctr, St Louis, MO 63108 USA; [Schlarbaum, Scott E.] Univ Tennessee, Inst Agr, Dept Forestry Wildlife & Fisheries, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Ma, Hong] Fudan Univ, Ctr Evolutionary Biol, Inst Plant Biol, Sch Life Sci,State Key Lab Genet Engn, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Ma, Hong] Fudan Univ, Inst Biomed Sci, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China","dePamphilis, CW (reprint author), Penn State Univ, Intercoll Grad Degree Program Plant Biol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",cwd3@psu.edu,"Jiao, Yuannian/H-8668-2012; Soltis, Pamela/L-5184-2015; dePamphilis, Claude/P-6652-2016","Jiao, Yuannian/0000-0002-8987-2782",NSF [DEB 0638595]; Department of Biology; Huck Institutes of Life Sciences of the Pennsylvania State University; Fudan University,"This work was supported primarily by NSF Plant Genome Research Program (DEB 0638595, The Ancestral Angiosperm Genome Project) and in part by the Department of Biology and by the Huck Institutes of Life Sciences of the Pennsylvania State University.

Here we modelled human lung adenocarcinoma, which frequently harbours activating point mutations in KRAS(1) and inactivation of the p53 pathway(2), using conditional alleles in mice(3-5). Lentiviral-mediated somatic activation of oncogenic Kras and deletion of p53 in the lung epithelial cells of Kras(LSL-G12D/+); p53(flox/flox) mice initiates lung adenocarcinoma development(4). Although tumours are initiated synchronously by defined genetic alterations, only a subset becomes malignant, indicating that disease progression requires additional alterations. Identification of the lentiviral integration sites allowed us to distinguish metastatic from non-metastatic tumours and determine the gene expression alterations that distinguish these tumour types. Cross-species analysis identified the NK2-related homeobox transcription factor Nkx2-1 (also called Ttf-1 or Titf1) as a candidate suppressor of malignant progression. In this mouse model, Nkx2-1 negativity is pathognomonic of high-grade poorly differentiated tumours. Gain-and loss-of-function experiments in cells derived from metastatic and non-metastatic tumours demonstrated that Nkx2-1 controls tumour differentiation and limits metastatic potential in vivo. Interrogation of Nkx2-1-regulated genes, analysis of tumours at defined developmental stages, and functional complementation experiments indicate that Nkx2-1 constrains tumours in part by repressing the embryonically restricted chromatin regulator Hmga(2). Whereas focal amplification of NKX2-1 in a fraction of human lung adenocarcinomas has focused attention on its oncogenic function(6-9), our data specifically link Nkx2-1 downregulation to loss of differentiation, enhanced tumour seeding ability and increased metastatic proclivity. Thus, the oncogenic and suppressive functions of Nkx2-1 in the same tumour type substantiate its role as a dual function lineage factor.","[Winslow, Monte M.; Dayton, Talya L.; Kim-Kiselak, Caroline; Snyder, Eric L.; Feldser, David M.; DuPage, Michel J.; Whittaker, Charles A.; Hoersch, Sebastian; Yoon, Stephanie; Crowley, Denise; Jacks, Tyler] MIT, David H Koch Inst Integrat Canc Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Winslow, Monte M.; Kim-Kiselak, Caroline; Jacks, Tyler] MIT, Ludwig Ctr Mol Oncol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Verhaak, Roel G.

The cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein (CPEB) promotes polyadenylation by nucleating a group of factors including defective in germline development 2 (Gld2), a non-canonical poly(A) polymerase(10-12), on specific messenger RNA (mRNA) 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). Because CPEB regulation of p53 mRNA polyadenylation/translation is necessary for cellular senescence in primary human diploid fibroblasts(6), we surmised that Gld2 would be the enzyme responsible for poly(A) addition. Here we show that depletion of Gld2 surprisingly promotes rather than inhibits p53 mRNA polyadenylation/translation, induces premature senescence and enhances the stability of CPEB mRNA. The CPEB 3' UTR contains two miR-122 binding sites, which when deleted, elevate mRNA translation, as does an antagomir of miR-122. Although miR-122 is thought to be liver specific, it is present in primary fibroblasts and destabilized by Gld2 depletion. Gld4, a second non-canonical poly(A) polymerase, was found to regulate p53 mRNA polyadenylation/translation in a CPEB-dependent manner. Thus, translational regulation of p53 mRNA and cellular senescence is coordinated by Gld2/miR-122/CPEB/Gld4.","[Burns, David M.; D'Ambrogio, Andrea; Nottrott, Stephanie; Richter, Joel D.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Program Mol Med, Worcester, MA 01605 USA","Richter, JD (reprint author), Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Program Mol Med, Worcester, MA 01605 USA.",joel.richter@umassmed.edu,"D'Ambrogio, Andrea/D-3729-2013",,Max Planck Society; European Molecular Biology Organization [ALTF 995-2004]; National Institutes of Health [AG30323],"We thank V.

This reaction has been proposed as a key transformation in the biosynthesis of many cyclohexene-containing secondary metabolites(2-5). However, only four purified enzymes have thus far been implicated in biotransformations that are consistent with a Diels-Alder reaction, namely solanapyrone synthase(6), LovB(7,8), macrophomate synthase(9,10), and riboflavin synthase(11,12). Although the stereochemical outcomes of these reactions indicate that the product formation could be enzyme-guided in each case, these enzymes typically demonstrate more than one catalytic activity, leaving their specific influence on the cycloaddition step uncertain. In our studies of the biosynthesis of spinosyn A, a tetracyclic polyketide-derived insecticide from Saccharopolyspora spinosa(13,14), we identified a cyclase, SpnF, that catalyses a transannular [4+2] cycloaddition to form the cyclohexene ring in spinosyn A. Kinetic analysis demonstrates that SpnF specifically accelerates the ring formation reaction with an estimated 500-fold rate enhancement. A second enzyme, SpnL, was also identified as responsible for the final cross-bridging step that completes the tetracyclic core of spinosyn A in a manner consistent with a Rauhut-Currier reaction(15). This work is significant because SpnF represents the first example characterized in vitro of a standalone enzyme solely committed to the catalysis of a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction. In addition, the mode of formation of the complex perhydro-as-indacene moiety in spinosyn A is now fully established.","[Kim, Hak Joong; Choi, Sei-hyun; Liu, Hung-wen] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Chem & Biochem, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Ruszczycky, Mark W.; Liu, Yung-nan; Liu, Hung-wen] Univ Texas Austin, Coll Pharm, Div Med Chem, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Liu, HW (reprint author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Chem & Biochem, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",h.w.liu@mail.utexas.edu,"Kim, Hak Joong/D-1117-2013",,"National Institutes of Health [GM035906, F32AI082906]; Texas Higher Education Coordination Board [ARP-003658-0093-2007]; Welch Foundation [F-1511]","We thank C.

Eight stars in the oldest globular cluster in the Galaxy, NGC 6522, were found to have surface abundances consistent with the gas from which they formed being enriched by massive stars(4) (that is, with higher alpha-element/Fe and Eu/Fe ratios than those of the Sun). However, the same stars have anomalously high abundances of Ba and La with respect to Fe(4), which usually arises through nucleosynthesis in low-mass stars(5) (via the slow-neutron-capture process, or s-process). Recent theory suggests that metal-poor fast-rotating massive stars are able to boost the s-process yields by up to four orders of magnitude(6), which might provide a solution to this contradiction. Here we report a reanalysis of the earlier spectra, which reveals that Y and Sr are also over-abundant with respect to Fe, showing a large scatter similar to that observed in extremely metal-poor stars(7), whereas C abundances are not enhanced. This pattern is best explained as originating in metal-poor fast-rotating massive stars, which might point to a common property of the first stellar generations and even of the 'first stars'.","[Chiappini, Cristina] Astrophys Inst Potsdam, D-14482 Potsdam, Germany; [Chiappini, Cristina; Meynet, Georges; Decressin, Thibaut; Maeder, Andre] Univ Geneva, Geneva Observ, CH-1290 Sauverny, Switzerland; [Chiappini, Cristina] Osserv Astron Trieste, Ist Nazl Astrofis, I-34143 Trieste, Italy; [Frischknecht, Urs; Pignatari, Marco] Univ Basel, Dept Phys, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; [Frischknecht, Urs; Hirschi, Raphael] Keele Univ, Astrophys Grp, Keele ST5 5BG, Staffs, England; [Hirschi, Raphael] Univ Tokyo, IPMU, Chiba 2778582, Japan; [Barbuy, Beatriz] Univ Sao Paulo, IAG, BR-05508900 Sao Paulo, Brazil","Chiappini, C (reprint author), Astrophys Inst Potsdam, Sternwarte 16, D-14482 Potsdam, Germany.",cristina.chiappini@aip.de,"Frischknecht, Urs/C-5050-2008","Pignatari, Marco/0000-0002-9048-6010","Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF); NSF [PHY 02-16783]; FAPESP; CNPq (Brazil); ESF-EuroGENESIS; World Premier International Research Center Initiative (WPI Initiative), MEXT, Japan","C.C., U.F., G.M., T.D. and A.

The nuclear receptors retinoic-acid-receptor-related orphan receptors alpha and gamma t (ROR alpha and ROR gamma t, respectively) have indispensible roles in the development of this cell type(4-7). Here we present SR1001, a high-affinity synthetic ligand-the first in a new class of compound-that is specific to both ROR alpha and ROR gamma t and which inhibits T(H)17 cell differentiation and function. SR1001 binds specifically to the ligand-binding domains of ROR alpha and ROR gamma t, inducing a conformational change within the ligand-binding domain that encompasses the repositioning of helix 12 and leads to diminished affinity for co-activators and increased affinity for co-repressors, resulting in suppression of the receptors' transcriptional activity. SR1001 inhibited the development of murine T(H)17 cells, as demonstrated by inhibition of interleukin-17A gene expression and protein production. Furthermore, SR1001 inhibited the expression of cytokines when added to differentiated murine or human T(H)17 cells. Finally, SR1001 effectively suppressed the clinical severity of autoimmune disease in mice. Our data demonstrate the feasibility of targeting the orphan receptors ROR alpha and ROR gamma t to inhibit specifically T(H)17 cell differentiation and function, and indicate that this novel class of compound has potential utility in the treatment of autoimmune diseases.","[Solt, Laura A.; Kumar, Naresh; Wang, Yongjun; Lauer, Janelle L.; Liu, Jin; Istrate, Monica A.; Griffin, Patrick R.; Burris, Thomas P.] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol Therapeut, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA; [Kumar, Naresh; Istrate, Monica A.; Vidovic, Dusica; Schuerer, Stephan C.; Griffin, Patrick R.] Scripps Res Inst, Scripps Res Inst Mol Screening Ctr, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA; [Nuhant, Philippe; Roush, William R.] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Chem, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA; [Kamenecka, Theodore M.; Griffin, Patrick R.] Scripps Res Inst, Translat Res Inst, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA; [Vidovic, Dusica; Schuerer, Stephan C.] Univ Miami, Ctr Computat Sci, Miami, FL 33136 USA; [Xu, Jihong; Wagoner, Gail; Drew, Paul D.] Univ Arkansas Med Sci, Dept Neurobiol & Dev Sci, Little Rock, AR 72205 USA","Burris, TP (reprint author), Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol Therapeut, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA.",tburris@scripps.edu,"Burris, Thomas/H-5078-2011; Burris, Thomas/B-3886-2016","Burris, Thomas/0000-0003-2922-4449","NIH [DK080201, DK089984, MH084512, DK088499, GM084041]; National Multiple Sclerosis Society [RG389A2/1]; NIH Molecular Library Screening Center Network (MLSCN) [U54MH074404]","This work was supported by NIH grants to T.

Our findings demonstrate a critical role for SHANK3 in the normal development of neuronal connectivity and establish causality between a disruption in the Shank3 gene and the genesis of autistic-like behaviours in mice.","[Peca, Joao; Feliciano, Catia; Ting, Jonathan T.; Wang, Wenting; Wells, Michael F.; Lascola, Christopher D.; Fu, Zhanyan; Feng, Guoping] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Neurobiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Peca, Joao] Univ Coimbra, Ctr Neurosci & Cell Biol, PhD Programme Biomed & Expt Biol, Coimbra, Portugal; [Feliciano, Catia] Gulbenkian Inst Sci, Gulbenkian PhD Programme Biomed, P-2781901 Oeiras, Portugal; [Venkatraman, Talaignair N.; Lascola, Christopher D.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Radiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Venkatraman, Talaignair N.; Lascola, Christopher D.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Brain Imaging & Anal Ctr, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Fu, Zhanyan] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Fu, Zhanyan; Feng, Guoping] MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, McGovern Inst Brain Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Feng, Guoping] Stanley Ctr Psychiat Res, Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA","Feng, GP (reprint author), Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Neurobiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA.",fengg@mit.edu,"Peca, Joao/K-7900-2013; Lascola, Christopher/B-9126-2017","Peca, Joao/0000-0003-4989-2129; Lascola, Christopher/0000-0002-8031-782X; Feliciano, Catia/0000-0001-7545-6924","NIMH/NIH [R01MH081201]; Hartwell Foundation; Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI); NARSAD; NIH [F32MH084460, R03MH085224]; Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [SFRH/BD/15231/2004, SFRH/BD/15855/2005]; ""Programa Gulbenkian de Doutoramento em Biomedicina'' (PGDB, Oeiras, Portugal); ""Programa Doutoral em Biologia Experimental e Biomedicina'' (CNC, Coimbra, Portugal)","We thank C.

However, what happens to neuronal firing after a long period of being awake is not known. Here we show that in freely behaving rats after a long period in an awake state, cortical neurons can go briefly 'offline' as in sleep, accompanied by slow waves in the local EEG. Neurons often go offline in one cortical area but not in another, and during these periods of 'local sleep', the incidence of which increases with the duration of the awake state, rats are active and display an 'awake' EEG. However, they are progressively impaired in a sugar pellet reaching task. Thus, although both the EEG and behaviour indicate wakefulness, local populations of neurons in the cortex may be falling asleep, with negative consequences for performance.","[Vyazovskiy, Vladyslav V.; Olcese, Umberto; Hanlon, Erin C.; Nir, Yuval; Cirelli, Chiara; Tononi, Giulio] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychiat, Madison, WI 53719 USA; [Olcese, Umberto] Scuola Super Sant Anna, PERCRO Lab, I-56217 Pisa, Italy","Tononi, G (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychiat, 6001 Res Pk Blvd, Madison, WI 53719 USA.",gtononi@wisc.edu,,"Vyazovskiy, Vladyslav/0000-0002-4336-6681; Nir, Yuval/0000-0002-5433-6349",NIMH [P20 MH077967]; NIH; AFOSR [FA9550-08-1-0244],"This work was supported by NIMH P20 MH077967 (C.

Here we have solved the crystal structures of S. cerevisiae ISW1a lacking its ATPase domain both alone and with DNA bound at resolutions of 3.25 angstrom and 3.60 angstrom, respectively, and we have visualized two different nucleosome-containing remodelling complexes using cryo-electron microscopy. The composite X-ray and electron microscopy structures combined with site-directed photocrosslinking analyses of these complexes suggest that ISW1a uses a dinucleosome substrate for chromatin remodelling.

The cleanest approach is to tune the carrier density using the electric field effect(2-7); for example, it was learned in this way(5) that weak electron localization transforms superconducting SrTiO3 into a Fermi-glass insulator. But in the copper oxides this has been a long-standing technical challenge(3), because perfect ultrathin films and huge local fields (>10(9) V m(-1)) are needed. Recently, such fields have been obtained using electrolytes or ionic liquids in the electric double-layer transistor configuration(8-10). Here we report synthesis of epitaxial films of La2 - xSrxCuO4 that are one unit cell thick, and fabrication of double-layer transistors. Very large fields and induced changes in surface carrier density enable shifts in the critical temperature by up to 30 K. Hundreds of resistance versus temperature and carrier density curves were recorded and shown to collapse onto a single function, as predicted for a two-dimensional superconductor-insulator transition(11-14). The observed critical resistance is precisely the quantum resistance for pairs, R-Q = h/(2e)(2) = 6.45 k Omega, suggestive of a phase transition driven by quantum phase fluctuations, and Cooper pair (de) localization.","[Bollinger, A.

The origin of these high elevations is unclear because unlike the surrounding provinces, which have undergone significant Cretaceous-Palaeogene compressional deformation followed by Neogene extensional deformation, the Colorado plateau is largely internally undeformed. Here we combine new seismic tomography(2) and receiver function images to resolve a vertical high-seismic-velocity anomaly beneath the west-central plateau that extends more than 200 km in depth. The upper surface of this anomaly is seismically defined by a dipping interface extending from the lower crust to depths of 70-90 km. The base of the continental crust above the anomaly has a similar shape, with an elevated Moho. We interpret these seismic structures as a continuing regional, delamination-style foundering of lower crust and continental lithosphere. This implies that Pliocene (2.6-5.3 Myr ago) uplift of the plateau and the magmatism on its margins are intimately tied to continuing deep lithospheric processes. Petrologic and geochemical observations indicate that late Cretaceous-Palaeogene (similar to 90-40 Myr ago) low-angle subduction hydrated and probably weakened much of the Proterozoic tecto-spheric mantle(3-5) beneath the Colorado plateau. We suggest that mid-Cenozoic (similar to 35-25 Myr ago) to Recent magmatic infiltration subsequently imparted negative compositional buoyancy to the base and sides of the Colorado plateau upper mantle, triggering downwelling. The patterns of magmatic activity suggest that previous such events have progressively removed the Colorado plateau lithosphere inward from its margins(6), and have driven uplift. Using Grand Canyon incision rates(7,8) and Pliocene basaltic volcanism patterns, we suggest that this particular event has been active over the past similar to 6 Myr.","[Levander, A.; Liu, K.; Lee, C. -T.

Neurons that arise in adults (adult-born neurons) show heightened synaptic plasticity during their maturation(3) and can account for up to ten per cent of the entire granule cell population(4). Moreover, levels of adult hippocampal neurogenesis are increased by interventions that are associated with beneficial effects on cognition and mood, such as learning(5), environmental enrichment(6), exercise(6) and chronic treatment with antidepressants(7-10). Together, these properties of adult neurogenesis indicate that this process could be harnessed to improve hippocampal functions. However, despite a substantial number of studies demonstrating that adult-born neurons are necessary for mediating specific cognitive functions(11), as well as some of the behavioural effects of antidepressants(8-10,12,13), it is unknown whether an increase in adult hippocampal neurogenesis is sufficient to improve cognition and mood. Here we show that inducible genetic expansion of the population of adult-born neurons through enhancing their survival improves performance in a specific cognitive task in which two similar contexts need to be distinguished. Mice with increased adult hippocampal neurogenesis show normal object recognition, spatial learning, contextual fear conditioning and extinction learning but are more efficient in differentiating between overlapping contextual representations, which is indicative of enhanced pattern separation. Furthermore, stimulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, when combined with an intervention such as voluntary exercise, produces a robust increase in exploratory behaviour. However, increasing adult hippocampal neurogenesis alone does not produce a behavioural response like that induced by anxiolytic agents or antidepressants. Together, our findings suggest that strategies that are designed to increase adult hippocampal neurogenesis specifically, by targeting the cell death of adult-born neurons or by other mechanisms, may have therapeutic potential for reversing impairments in pattern separation and dentate gyrus dysfunction such as those seen during normal ageing(14,15).","[Sahay, Amar; Scobie, Kimberly N.; Hill, Alexis S.; O'Carroll, Colin M.; Kheirbek, Mazen A.; Burghardt, Nesha S.; Dranovsky, Alex; Hen, Rene] Columbia Univ, Dept Neurosci, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Sahay, Amar; Scobie, Kimberly N.; Hill, Alexis S.; O'Carroll, Colin M.; Kheirbek, Mazen A.; Burghardt, Nesha S.; Dranovsky, Alex; Hen, Rene] Columbia Univ, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Sahay, Amar; Scobie, Kimberly N.; Hill, Alexis S.; O'Carroll, Colin M.; Kheirbek, Mazen A.; Burghardt, Nesha S.; Dranovsky, Alex; Hen, Rene] New York State Psychiat Inst & Hosp, Div Integrat Neurosci, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Fenton, Andre A.] SUNY, Downstate Med Ctr, Robert F Furchgott Ctr Neural & Behav Sci, Dept Physiol, Brooklyn, NY 11203 USA; [Fenton, Andre A.] SUNY, Downstate Med Ctr, Dept Pharmacol & Neurol, Brooklyn, NY 11203 USA; [Hen, Rene] Columbia Univ, Dept Pharmacol, New York, NY 10032 USA","Sahay, A (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Dept Neurosci, New York, NY 10032 USA.",as2619@columbia.edu; rh95@columbia.edu,"Kheirbek, Mazen/J-3656-2015","Kheirbek, Mazen/0000-0003-2029-802X; Fenton, Andre/0000-0002-5063-1156",National Institute of Mental Health [1K99MH86615-01]; National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression (NARSAD); Sackler Institute of Columbia University; Ruth L.

Dectin-1 (also known as CLEC7A) is a pattern-recognition receptor expressed by myeloid phagocytes (macrophages, dendritic cells and neutrophils) that detects beta-glucans in fungal cell walls and triggers direct cellular antimicrobial activity, including phagocytosis and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS)(1,2). In contrast to inflammatory responses stimulated upon detection of soluble ligands by other pattern-recognition receptors, such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), these responses are only useful when a cell comes into direct contact with a microbe and must not be spuriously activated by soluble stimuli. In this study we show that, despite its ability to bind both soluble and particulate beta-glucan polymers, Dectin-1 signalling is only activated by particulate beta-glucans, which cluster the receptor in synapse-like structures from which regulatory tyrosine phosphatases CD45 and CD148 (also known as PTPRC and PTPRJ, respectively) are excluded (Supplementary Fig. 1). The 'phagocytic synapse' now provides a model mechanism by which innate immune receptors can distinguish direct microbial contact from detection of microbes at a distance, thereby initiating direct cellular antimicrobial responses only when they are required.","[Goodridge, Helen S.; Reyes, Christopher N.; Becker, Courtney A.; Ma, Jun; Wolf, Andrea J.; Underhill, David M.] Cedars Sinai Med Ctr, IBD & Immunobiol Res Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90048 USA; [Goodridge, Helen S.] Cedars Sinai Med Ctr, Regenerat Med Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90048 USA; [Goodridge, Helen S.; Underhill, David M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Katsumoto, Tamiko R.; Weiss, Arthur] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Med, Rosalind Russell Med Res Ctr Arthrit, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Bose, Nandita; Chan, Anissa S.

However, recent studies have suggested that mitochondrial ROS (mROS) also contribute to mouse macrophage bactericidal activity, although the mechanisms linking innate immune signalling to mitochondria for mROS generation remain unclear(2-4). Here we demonstrate that engagement of a subset of Toll-like receptors (TLR1, TLR2 and TLR4) results in the recruitment of mitochondria to macrophage phagosomes and augments mROS production. This response involves translocation of a TLR signalling adaptor, tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), to mitochondria, where it engages the protein ECSIT (evolutionarily conserved signalling intermediate in Toll pathways), which is implicated in mitochondrial respiratory chain assembly(5). Interaction with TRAF6 leads to ECSIT ubiquitination and enrichment at the mitochondrial periphery, resulting in increased mitochondrial and cellular ROS generation. ECSIT-and TRAF6-depleted macrophages have decreased levels of TLR-induced ROS and are significantly impaired in their ability to kill intracellular bacteria. Additionally, reducing macrophage mROS levels by expressing catalase in mitochondria results in defective bacterial killing, confirming the role of mROS in bactericidal activity. These results reveal a novel pathway linking innate immune signalling to mitochondria, implicate mROS as an important component of antibacterial responses and further establish mitochondria as hubs for innate immune signalling.","[Ghosh, Sankar] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, New York, NY 10032 USA; [West, A.

The cellular factors that mediate this defence are the products of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Although hundreds of ISGs have been identified since their discovery more than 25 years ago(1-3), only a few have been characterized with respect to antiviral activity. For most ISG products, little is known about their antiviral potential, their target specificity and their mechanisms of action. Using an overexpression screening approach, here we show that different viruses are targeted by unique sets of ISGs. We find that each viral species is susceptible to multiple antiviral genes, which together encompass a range of inhibitory activities. To conduct the screen, more than 380 human ISGs were tested for their ability to inhibit the replication of several important human and animal viruses, including hepatitis C virus, yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, chikungunya virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus and human immunodeficiency virus type-1. Broadly acting effectors included IRF1, C6orf150 (also known as MB21D1), HPSE, RIG-I (also known as DDX58), MDA5 (also known as IFIH1) and IFITM3, whereas more targeted antiviral specificity was observed with DDX60, IFI44L, IFI6, IFITM2, MAP3K14, MOV10, NAMPT (also known as PBEF1), OASL, RTP4, TREX1 and UNC84B (also known as SUN2). Combined expression of pairs of ISGs showed additive antiviral effects similar to those of moderate type I interferon doses. Mechanistic studies uncovered a common theme of translational inhibition for numerous effectors. Several ISGs, including ADAR, FAM46C, LY6E and MCOLN2, enhanced the replication of certain viruses, highlighting another layer of complexity in the highly pleiotropic type I interferon system.","[Schoggins, John W.; Panis, Maryline; Murphy, Mary Y.; Jones, Christopher T.; Rice, Charles M.] Rockefeller Univ, Lab Virol & Infect Dis, Ctr Study Hepatitis C, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Wilson, Sam J.; Bieniasz, Paul] Rockefeller Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Aaron Diamond AIDS Res Ctr, Lab Retrovirol, New York, NY 10016 USA","Rice, CM (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Lab Virol & Infect Dis, Ctr Study Hepatitis C, New York, NY 10065 USA.",ricec@mail.rockefeller.edu,,"Wilson, Sam/0000-0002-6065-0895","New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) [C023046]; National Institutes of Health [AI057158, AI064003]; Greenberg Medical Research Institute; Starr Foundation; Ronald A.

Genome-wide association studies in humans have linked genes involved in T(H)17 cell differentiation and function with susceptibility to Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis(1-3). Thus, the pathway towards differentiation of T(H)17 cells and, perhaps, of related innate lymphoid cells with similar effector functions(4,5), is an attractive target for therapeutic applications. Mouse and human T(H)17 cells are distinguished by expression of the retinoic acid receptor-related orphan nuclear receptor ROR gamma t, which is required for induction of IL-17 transcription and for the manifestation of T(H)17-dependent autoimmune disease in mice(6). By performing a chemical screen with an insect cell-based reporter system, we identified the cardiac glycoside digoxin as a specific inhibitor of ROR gamma t transcriptional activity. Digoxin inhibited murine T(H)17 cell differentiation without affecting differentiation of other T cell lineages and was effective in delaying the onset and reducing the severity of autoimmune disease in mice. At high concentrations, digoxin is toxic for human cells, but non-toxic synthetic derivatives 20,22-dihydrodigoxin-21,23-diol and digoxin-21-salicylidene specifically inhibited induction of IL-17 in human CD4(+) T cells. Using these small-molecule compounds, we demonstrate that ROR gamma t is important for the maintenance of IL-17 expression in mouse and human effector T cells. These data indicate that derivatives of digoxin can be used as chemical templates for the development of ROR gamma t-targeted therapeutic agents that attenuate inflammatory lymphocyte function and autoimmune disease.","[Huh, Jun R.; Leung, Monica W.

A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 35 kb upstream of HLA-C (rs9264942; termed -35) associates with control of HIV(5-7), and with levels of HLA-C messenger RNA transcripts(8) and cell-surface expression(7), but the mechanism underlying its varied expression is unknown. We proposed that the -35 SNP is not the causal variant for differential HLA-C expression, but rather is marking another polymorphism that directly affects levels of HLA-C(7). Here we show that variation within the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of HLA-C regulates binding of the microRNA hsa-miR-148 to its target site, resulting in relatively low surface expression of alleles that bind this microRNA and high expression of HLA-C alleles that escape post-transcriptional regulation. The 3' UTR variant associates strongly with control of HIV, potentially adding to the effects of genetic variation encoding the peptide-binding region of the HLA class I loci. Variation in HLA-C expression adds another layer of diversity to this highly polymorphic locus that must be considered when deciphering the function of these molecules in health and disease.","[Kulkarni, Smita; Qi, Ying; Gao, Xiaojiang; Yuki, Yuko; Bass, Sara E.; Martin, Maureen P.; Carrington, Mary] NCI, Canc & Inflammat Program, Expt Immunol Lab, SAIC Frederick Inc, Frederick, MD 21702 USA; [Kulkarni, Smita; Qi, Ying; Gao, Xiaojiang; Yuki, Yuko; Martin, Maureen P.; Pereyra, Florencia; Walker, Bruce; Carrington, Mary] Harvard Univ, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Kulkarni, Smita; Qi, Ying; Gao, Xiaojiang; Yuki, Yuko; Martin, Maureen P.; Pereyra, Florencia; Walker, Bruce; Carrington, Mary] MIT, Ragon Inst, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Hunt, Peter; Deeks, Steven G.] Univ Calif San Francisco, San Francisco Gen Hosp, Div Aids, San Francisco, CA 94110 USA; [Telenti, Amalio] Univ Lausanne, Inst Microbiol, CH-1011 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Goldstein, David] Duke Univ, Inst Genome Sci & Policy, Ctr Human Genome Variat, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Wolinsky, Steven] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Div Infect Dis, Chicago, IL 60611 USA","Carrington, M (reprint author), NCI, Canc & Inflammat Program, Expt Immunol Lab, SAIC Frederick Inc, Frederick, MD 21702 USA.",carringm@mail.nih.gov,"Wolinsky, Steven/B-2893-2012; SHCS, int. coll.

Because evolutionary success is dependent on the total number of rounds performed(2), a means of performing laboratory evolution continuously and rapidly could dramatically enhance its effectiveness(3). Although researchers have accelerated individual steps in the evolutionary cycle(4-9), the only previous example of continuous directed evolution was the landmark study of Wright and Joyce(10), who continuously evolved RNA ligase ribozymes with an in vitro replication cycle that unfortunately cannot be easily adapted to other biomolecules. Here we describe a system that enables the continuous directed evolution of gene-encoded molecules that can be linked to protein production in Escherichia coli. During phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE), evolving genes are transferred from host cell to host cell through a modified bacteriophage life cycle in a manner that is dependent on the activity of interest. Dozens of rounds of evolution can occur in a single day of PACE without human intervention. Using PACE, we evolved T7 RNA polymerase (RNAP) variants that recognize a distinct promoter, initiate transcripts with ATP instead of GTP, and initiate transcripts with CTP. In one example, PACE executed 200 rounds of protein evolution over the course of 8 days. Starting from undetectable activity levels in two of these cases, enzymes with each of the three target activities emerged in less than 1 week of PACE. In all three cases, PACE-evolved polymerase activities exceeded or were comparable to that of the wild-type T7 RNAP on its wild-type promoter, representing improvements of up to several hundred-fold. By greatly accelerating laboratory evolution, PACE may provide solutions to otherwise intractable directed evolution problems and address novel questions about molecular evolution.","[Carlson, Jacob C.; Liu, David R.] Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Esvelt, Kevin M.] Harvard Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Liu, David R.] Harvard Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Liu, DR (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",drliu@fas.harvard.edu,,"Esvelt, Kevin/0000-0001-8797-3945",National Institutes of Health/National Institute of General Medical Sciences [R01 GM065400]; HHMI; Hertz Foundation; National Science Foundation; Harvard Chemical Biology Graduate Program,"This work was supported by National Institutes of Health/National Institute of General Medical Sciences R01 GM065400 and by HHMI.

Simulating magnetic materials in the vicinity of a quantum phase transition is computationally intractable on classical computers, owing to the extreme complexity arising from quantum entanglement between the constituent magnetic spins. Here we use a degenerate Bose gas of rubidium atoms confined in an optical lattice to simulate a chain of interacting quantum Ising spins as they undergo a phase transition. Strong spin interactions are achieved through a site-occupation to pseudo-spin mapping. As we vary a magnetic field, quantum fluctuations drive a phase transition from a paramagnetic phase into an antiferromagnetic phase. In the paramagnetic phase, the interaction between the spins is overwhelmed by the applied field, which aligns the spins. In the antiferromagnetic phase, the interaction dominates and produces staggered magnetic ordering. Magnetic domain formation is observed through both in situ site-resolved imaging and noise correlation measurements. By demonstrating a route to quantum magnetism in an optical lattice, this work should facilitate further investigations of magnetic models using ultracold atoms, thereby improving our understanding of real magnetic materials.","[Simon, Jonathan; Bakr, Waseem S.; Ma, Ruichao; Tai, M.

A classical flexible behaviour is the exploration-exploitation decision, which describes the time at which foraging animals choose to abandon a depleting food supply. We have used quantitative genetic analysis to examine the decision to leave a food patch in Caenorhabditis elegans. Here we show that patch-leaving is a multigenic trait regulated in part by naturally occurring non-coding polymorphisms in tyra-3 (tyramine receptor 3), which encodes a G-protein-coupled catecholamine receptor related to vertebrate adrenergic receptors. tyra-3 acts in sensory neurons that detect environmental cues, suggesting that the internal catecholamines detected by tyra-3 regulate responses to external conditions. These results indicate that genetic variation and environmental cues converge on common circuits to regulate behaviour, and suggest that catecholamines have an ancient role in regulating behavioural decisions.","[Bendesky, Andres; Tsunozaki, Makoto; Bargmann, Cornelia I.] Rockefeller Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Lab Neural Circuits & Behav, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Rockman, Matthew V.] New York Univ, Dept Biol, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Rockman, Matthew V.] New York Univ, Ctr Genom & Syst Biol, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Kruglyak, Leonid] Princeton Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Lewis Sigler Inst Integrat Genom, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Kruglyak, Leonid] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Carl Icahn Lab, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Bargmann, CI (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Lab Neural Circuits & Behav, New York, NY 10065 USA.",cori@rockefeller.edu,,"Bargmann, Cornelia/0000-0002-8484-0618",Secretaria de Educacion Publica of Mexico; Rockefeller University; HHMI; NIH [GM089972],"We thank R.

Activated microglia release pro-inflammatory factors that may be neurotoxic. Here we show that the orderly activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3/7, known executioners of apoptotic cell death, regulate microglia activation through a protein kinase C (PKC)-delta-dependent pathway. We find that stimulation of microglia with various inflammogens activates caspase-8 and caspase-3/7 in microglia without triggering cell death in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown or chemical inhibition of each of these caspases hindered microglia activation and consequently reduced neurotoxicity. We observe that these caspases are activated in microglia in the ventral mesencephalon of Parkinson's disease (PD) and the frontal cortex of individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Taken together, we show that caspase-8 and caspase-3/7 are involved in regulating microglia activation. We conclude that inhibition of these caspases could be neuroprotective by targeting the microglia rather than the neurons themselves.","[Burguillos, Miguel A.; Kavanagh, Edel; Hajji, Nabil; Joseph, Bertrand] Karolinska Inst, Dept Oncol Pathol, Canc Ctr Karolinska, S-17176 Stockholm, Sweden; [Burguillos, Miguel A.; Cano, Josefina; Venero, Jose L.] Univ Seville, Dept Bioquim & Biol Mol, Fac Farm, E-41012 Seville, Spain; [Burguillos, Miguel A.; Cano, Josefina; Venero, Jose L.] Inst Biomed Sevilla, Seville 41012, Spain; [Burguillos, Miguel A.; Deierborg, Tomas; Brundin, Patrik] Wallenberg Neurosci Ctr, Dept Expt Med Sci, Neuronal Survival Unit, S-22184 Lund, Sweden; [Persson, Annette; Englund, Elisabet] Univ Lund Hosp, Div Neuropathol, Dept Pathol, S-22185 Lund, Sweden; [Garcia-Quintanilla, Albert] Univ Seville, Serv Biol, CITIUS, Ctr Invest Tecnol & Innovac, E-41012 Seville, Spain","Joseph, B (reprint author), Karolinska Inst, Dept Oncol Pathol, Canc Ctr Karolinska, S-17176 Stockholm, Sweden.",jlvenero@us.es; bertrand.joseph@ki.se,"Venero, Jose/E-9979-2015; IBIS, ENVEJECIMIENTO/O-9381-2015; Deierborg, Tomas/P-6345-2015","Venero, Jose/0000-0003-1137-8706; Deierborg, Tomas/0000-0002-3651-3444; Garcia-Quintanilla, Albert/0000-0001-9617-1354; Englund, Elisabet /0000-0002-2708-2443","Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnologia [SAF2006-04119, 2009-13778]; Swedish Research Council; Parkinson Foundation of Sweden; Swedish Alzheimer Foundation; Swedish Cancer Society","We thank A.

The ULD and SDD mediate a critical interaction with I kappa B alpha that restricts substrate specificity, and the ULD is also required for catalytic activity. The SDD mediates IKK beta dimerization, but dimerization per se is not important for maintaining IKK beta activity and instead is required for IKK beta activation.

Powerful field-aligned electron beams associated with the Io-Jupiter coupling, for example, create an auroral footprint in Jupiter's ionosphere(10,11). Auroral ultraviolet emission associated with Enceladus-Saturn coupling is anticipated to be just a few tenths of a kilorayleigh (ref. 12), about an order of magnitude dimmer than Io's footprint and below the observable threshold, consistent with its non-detection(13). Here we report the detection of magnetic-field-aligned ion and electron beams (offset several moon radii downstream from Enceladus) with sufficient power to stimulate detectable aurora, and the subsequent discovery of Enceladus-associated aurora in a few per cent of the scans of the moon's footprint. The footprint varies in emission magnitude more than can plausibly be explained by changes in magnetospheric parameters-and as such is probably indicative of variable plume activity.","[Rymer, Abigail M.; Mitchell, Donald G.; Mauk, Barry H.; Krimigis, Stamatios M.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Appl Phys Lab, Laurel, MD 20723 USA; [Pryor, Wayne R.] Cent Arizona Coll, Dept Sci, Coolidge, AZ 85128 USA; [Pryor, Wayne R.] Space Environm Technol, Pacific Palisades, CA 90272 USA; [Hill, Thomas W.] Rice Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Young, David T.; Crary, Frank J.] SW Res Inst, Space Sci & Engn Div, San Antonio, TX 78238 USA; [Saur, Joachim; Jacobsen, Sven] Univ Cologne, Inst Geophys & Meteorol, D-50923 Cologne, Germany; [Jones, Geraint H.; Coates, Andrew J.] Univ Coll London, Mullard Space Sci Lab, Dept Space & Climate Phys, Dorking RH5 6NT, Surrey, England; [Jones, Geraint H.] Univ London Birkbeck Coll, Ctr Planetary Sci, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Cowley, Stan W.

They consist of telechelic, rubbery, low-molecular-mass polymers with ligand end groups that are non-covalently linked through metal-ion binding. On exposure to ultraviolet light, the metal-ligand motifs are electronically excited and the absorbed energy is converted into heat. This causes temporary disengagement of the metal-ligand motifs and a concomitant reversible decrease in the polymers' molecular mass and viscosity(5), thereby allowing quick and efficient defect healing. Light can be applied locally to a damage site, so objects can in principle be healed under load. We anticipate that this approach to healable materials, based on supramolecular polymers and a light-heat conversion step, can be applied to a wide range of supramolecular materials that use different chemistries.","[Burnworth, Mark; Tang, Liming; Kumpfer, Justin R.; Rowan, Stuart J.; Weder, Christoph] Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Macromol Sci & Engn, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Duncan, Andrew J.; Beyer, Frederick L.] USA, Res Lab, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21005 USA; [Fiore, Gina L.; Weder, Christoph] Univ Fribourg, Adolphe Merkle Inst, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland; [Fiore, Gina L.; Weder, Christoph] Univ Fribourg, Fribourg Ctr Nanomat, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland","Rowan, SJ (reprint author), Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Macromol Sci & Engn, 2100 Adelbert Rd, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",stuart.rowan@case.edu; christoph.weder@unifr.ch,"Weder, Christoph/K-7453-2012","Merkle Institute, Adolphe/0000-0002-6220-424X; Rowan, Stuart/0000-0001-8176-0594; Weder, Christoph/0000-0001-7183-1790","US Army Research Office [W911NF-09-1-0288, W911NF-06-1-0414]; National Science Foundation [CHE-0704026, DMR-0602869, MRI-0821515]; Adolphe Merkle Foundation; US Army Research Laboratory [ORISE-1120-1120-99]; US Department of Energy [ORISE-1120-1120-99]","This material is based on work supported by the US Army Research Office (W911NF-09-1-0288 and W911NF-06-1-0414); the National Science Foundation under grant numbers CHE-0704026, DMR-0602869 and MRI-0821515; the Adolphe Merkle Foundation; and the Postgraduate Research Participation Program at the US Army Research Laboratory, administered by the Oak Ridge Institute of Science and Education through an interagency agreement between the US Department of Energy and Army Research Laboratory (contract number ORISE-1120-1120-99).

However, despite a significant increase in the amount of data related to the morphology, mineralogy and chemistry of the martian surface, there is no clear global picture of how magmatism has evolved over time and how these changes relate to the internal workings and thermal evolution of the planet. Here we present geochemical data derived from the Gamma Ray Spectrometer on board NASA's Mars Odyssey spacecraft(2), focusing on twelve major volcanic provinces of variable age. Our analysis reveals clear trends in composition that are found to be consistent with varying degrees of melting of the martian mantle. There is evidence for thickening of the lithosphere (17-25 km Gyr(-1)) associated with a decrease in mantle potential temperature over time (30-40 K Gyr(-1)).

Environmental heterogeneity is considered to be important(1), yet diversity in seemingly homogeneous environments is nonetheless observed(2). This, it is assumed, must either be owing to weak selection, mutational input or a fitness advantage to genotypes when rare(1). Here we demonstrate the possibility of a new general mechanism of stable diversity maintenance, one that stems from metabolic and physiological trade-offs(3). The model requires that such trade-offs translate into a fitness landscape in which the most fit has unfit near-mutational neighbours, and a lower fitness peak also exists that is more mutationally robust. The 'survival of the fittest' applies at low mutation rates, giving way to 'survival of the flattest'(4-6) at high mutation rates. However, as a consequence of quasispecies-level negative frequency-dependent selection and differences in mutational robustness we observe a transition zone in which both fittest and flattest coexist. Although diversity maintenance is possible for simple organisms in simple environments, the more trade-offs there are, the wider the maintenance zone becomes. The principle may be applied to lineages within a species or species within a community, potentially explaining why competitive exclusion need not be observed in homogeneous environments. This principle predicts the enigmatic richness of metabolic strategies in clonal bacteria(7) and questions the safety of lethal mutagenesis(8,9) as an antimicrobial treatment.","[Hurst, Laurence D.] Univ Bath, Dept Biol & Biochem, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Beardmore, Robert E.; Gudelj, Ivana] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Math, London SW7 2A7, England; [Lipson, David A.] San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, San Diego, CA 92182 USA","Hurst, LD (reprint author), Univ Bath, Dept Biol & Biochem, Claverton Down, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England.",l.d.hurst@bath.ac.uk,"Hurst, Laurence/F-9215-2010","Hurst, Laurence/0000-0002-1002-1054",Royal Society; EPSRC; NERC,"We thank C.

It is thought that beyond fetal 5-HT neurons there are significant maternal contributions to fetal 5-HT during pregnancy(1,2) but this has not been tested empirically. To examine putative central and peripheral sources of embryonic brain 5-HT, we used Pet1(-/-) (also called Fev) mice in which most dorsal raphe neurons lack 5-HT3. We detected previously unknown differences in accumulation of 5-HT between the forebrain and hindbrain during early and late fetal stages, through an exogenous source of 5-HT which is not of maternal origin. Using additional genetic strategies, a new technology for studying placental biology ex vivo and direct manipulation of placental neosynthesis, we investigated the nature of this exogenous source. We uncovered a placental 5-HT synthetic pathway from a maternal tryptophan precursor in both mice and humans. This study reveals a new, direct role for placental metabolic pathways in modulating fetal brain development and indicates that maternal-placental-fetal interactions could underlie the pronounced impact of 5-HT on long-lasting mental health outcomes.","[Bonnin, Alexandre; Goeden, Nick; Levitt, Pat] Univ So Calif, Keck Sch Med, Zilkha Neurogenet Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Bonnin, Alexandre; Levitt, Pat] Univ So Calif, Keck Sch Med, Dept Cell & Neurobiol, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Chen, Kevin; Shih, Jean C.] Univ So Calif, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmacol & Pharmaceut Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Wilson, Melissa L.; King, Jennifer] Univ So Calif, Keck Sch Med, Dept OB GYN, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Wilson, Melissa L.; King, Jennifer] Univ So Calif, Keck Sch Med, Dept Prevent Med, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Blakely, Randy D.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Pharmacol, Med Ctr, Nashville, TN 37221 USA; [Blakely, Randy D.] Vanderbilt Univ, Ctr Mol Neurosci, Med Ctr, Nashville, TN 37221 USA; [Deneris, Evan S.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Neurosci, Sch Med, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA","Bonnin, A (reprint author), Univ So Calif, Keck Sch Med, Zilkha Neurogenet Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",bonnin@usc.edu; plevitt@usc.edu,,,"NICHD [5R21HD065287]; NARSAD; NIMH [R01MH39085, 1P50MH078280A1]","We thank H.

Within the mammalian cortex specifically, the development of dendrites and commissural axons in pyramidal cells is activity-dependent(7,8). However, little is known about the developmental role of activity in the other major cortical population of neurons, the GABA-producing interneurons. These neurons are morphologically and functionally heterogeneous and efforts over the past decade have focused on determining the mechanisms that contribute to this diversity(9-11). It was recently discovered that 30% of all cortical interneurons arise from a relatively novel source within the ventral telencephalon, the caudal ganglionic eminence (CGE)(11,12). Owing to their late birth date, these interneurons populate the cortex only after the majority of other interneurons and pyramidal cells are already in place and have started to functionally integrate. Here we demonstrate in mice that for CGE-derived reelin (Re)-positive and calretinin (Cr)-positive (but not vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-positive) interneurons(12,13), activity is essential before postnatal day 3 for correct migration, and that after postnatal day 3, glutamate-mediated activity controls the development of their axons and dendrites. Furthermore, we show that the engulfment and cell motility 1 gene (Elmo1)(14), a target of the transcription factor distal-less homeobox 1 (Dlx1)(15), is selectively expressed in Re+ and Cr+ interneurons and is both necessary and sufficient for activity-dependent interneuron migration. Our findings reveal a selective requirement for activity in shaping the cortical integration of specific neuronal subtypes.","[Garcia, Natalia V.

The secreted glycoprotein Reelin (also known as RELN) guides migration of neurons by binding to two lipoprotein receptors, the very-low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) and apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2, also known as LRP8)(1). Loss of Reelin function in humans results in the severe developmental disorder lissencephaly(2) and it has also been associated with other neurological disorders such as epilepsy, schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease(3). The molecular mechanisms by which Reelin activates its receptors and controls cellular functions are largely unknown. Here we show that the neuronal guidance cues ephrin B proteins are essential for Reelin signalling during the development of laminated structures in the brain. We show that ephrin Bs genetically interact with Reelin. Notably, compound mouse mutants (Reln(+/-); Efnb3(-/-) or Reln(+/-); Efnb2(-/-)) and triple ephrin B1, B2, B3 knockouts show neuronal migration defects that recapitulate the ones observed in the neocortex, hippocampus and cerebellum of the reeler mouse. Mechanistically, we show that Reelin binds to the extracellular domain of ephrin Bs, which associate at the membrane with VLDLR and ApoER2 in neurons. Clustering of ephrin Bs leads to the recruitment and phosphorylation of Dab1 which is necessary for Reelin signalling. Conversely, loss of function of ephrin Bs severely impairs Reelin-induced Dab1 phosphorylation. Importantly, activation of ephrin Bs can rescue the reeler neuronal migration defects in the absence of Reelin protein. Together, our results identify ephrin Bs as essential components of the Reelin receptor/signalling pathway to control neuronal migration during the development of the nervous system.","[Sentuerk, Aycan; Pfennig, Sylvia; Weiss, Alexander; Burk, Katja; Acker-Palmer, Amparo] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Frankfurt Inst Mol Life Sci FMLS, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany; [Sentuerk, Aycan; Pfennig, Sylvia; Weiss, Alexander; Burk, Katja; Acker-Palmer, Amparo] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Cell Biol & Neurosci, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany","Acker-Palmer, A (reprint author), Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Frankfurt Inst Mol Life Sci FMLS, Max von Laue Str 9, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany.",Acker-Palmer@bio.uni-frankfurt.de,,,"Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology in Martinsried (Germany); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [AC180/2-1, 2-2]; University Frankfurt [EXC115, EXC147]","We would like to thank R.

Antiviral potency correlates with TRIM5 avidity for the retrovirion capsid lattice(3,4) and several reports indicate that TRIM5 has a role in signal transduction(5-7), but the precise mechanism of restriction is unknown(8). Here we demonstrate that TRIM5 promotes innate immune signalling and that this activity is amplified by retroviral infection and interaction with the capsid lattice. Acting with the heterodimeric, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC13-UEV1A (also known as UBE2N-UBE2V1), TRIM5 catalyses the synthesis of unattached K63-linked ubiquitin chains that activate the TAK1 (also known as MAP3K7) kinase complex and stimulate AP-1 and NF kappa B signalling. Interaction with the HIV-1 capsid lattice greatly enhances the UBC13-UEV1A-dependent E3 activity of TRIM5 and challenge with retroviruses induces the transcription of AP-1 and NF-kappa B-dependent factors with a magnitude that tracks with TRIM5 avidity for the invading capsid. Finally, TAK1 and UBC13-UEV1A contribute to capsid-specific restriction by TRIM5. Thus, the retroviral restriction factor TRIM5 has two additional activities that are linked to restriction: it constitutively promotes innate immune signalling and it acts as a pattern recognition receptor specific for the retrovirus capsid lattice.","[Pertel, Thomas; Hausmann, Stephane; Guerra, Jessica; Lascano, Josefina; Reinhard, Christian; Santoni, Federico A.; Strambio-De-Castillia, Caterina; Pizzato, Massimo; Luban, Jeremy] Univ Geneva, Dept Microbiol & Mol Med, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Morger, Damien; Zueger, Sara; Gruetter, Markus G.] Univ Zurich, Dept Biochem, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Uchil, Pradeep D.; Mothes, Walther] Yale Univ, Sect Microbial Pathogenesis, Sch Med, New Haven, CT 06536 USA; [Chatel, Laurence] Novimmune SA, CH-1228 Geneva, Switzerland; [Bisiaux, Aurelie; Albert, Matthew L.] Inst Pasteur, INSERM, U818, F-75724 Paris, France","Luban, J (reprint author), Univ Geneva, Dept Microbiol & Mol Med, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland.",jeremy.luban@unige.ch,"Albert, Matthew/C-9782-2009","Pertel, Thomas/0000-0002-2286-6011; Strambio De Castillia, Caterina/0000-0002-1069-1816","NIH [RO1AI59159, R21AI087467]; Swiss National Science Foundation [3100A0-128655, 3100A0-122342]; UZH Forschungskredit [54041402]","We thank D.

Aberrant activation of this pathway through oncogenic mutations is responsible for a large proportion of human cancer. Kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR)(1-3) functions as an essential scaffolding protein to coordinate the assembly of Raf-MEK-ERK complexes(4,5). Here we integrate structural and biochemical studies to understand how KSR promotes stimulatory Raf phosphorylation of MEK (refs 6, 7). We show, from the crystal structure of the kinase domain of human KSR2 (KSR2(KD)) in complex with rabbit MEK1, that interactions between KSR2(KD) and MEK1 are mediated by their respective activation segments and C-lobe alpha G helices. Analogous to BRAF (refs 8, 9), KSR2 self-associates through a side-to-side interface involving Arg 718, a residue identified in a genetic screen as a suppressor of Ras signalling(1-3). ATP is bound to the KSR2(KD) catalytic site, and we demonstrate KSR2 kinase activity towards MEK1 by in vitro assays and chemical genetics. In the KSR2(KD)-MEK1 complex, the activation segments of both kinases are mutually constrained, and KSR2 adopts an inactive conformation. BRAF allosterically stimulates the kinase activity of KSR2, which is dependent on formation of a side-to-side KSR2-BRAF heterodimer. Furthermore, KSR2-BRAF heterodimerization results in an increase of BRAF-induced MEK phosphorylation via the KSR2-mediated relay of a signal from BRAF to release the activation segment of MEK for phosphorylation. We propose that KSR interacts with a regulatory Raf molecule in cis to induce a conformational switch of MEK, facilitating MEK's phosphorylation by a separate catalytic Raf molecule in trans.","[Brennan, Damian F.; Chao, William C.

The developmental regulation of this process has been extensively investigated in mice, where the X chromosome of paternal origin (Xp) is silenced during early embryogenesis owing to imprinted expression of the regulatory RNA, Xist (X-inactive specific transcript). Paternal XCI is reversed in the inner cell mass of the blastocyst and random XCI subsequently occurs in epiblast cells. Here we show that other eutherian mammals have very different strategies for initiating XCI. In rabbits and humans, the Xist homologue is not subject to imprinting and XCI begins later than in mice. Furthermore, Xist is upregulated on both X chromosomes in a high proportion of rabbit and human embryo cells, even in the inner cell mass. In rabbits, this triggers XCI on both X chromosomes in some cells. In humans, chromosome-wide XCI has not initiated even by the blastocyst stage, despite the upregulation of XIST. The choice of which X chromosome will finally become inactive thus occurs downstream of Xist upregulation in both rabbits and humans, unlike in mice. Our study demonstrates the remarkable diversity in XCI regulation and highlights differences between mammals in their requirement for dosage compensation during early embryogenesis.","[Okamoto, Ikuhiro; Patrat, Catherine; Diabangouaya, Patricia; Heard, Edith] Inst Curie, Mammalian Dev Epigenet Grp, CNRS UMR 3215, INSERM,U934, F-75248 Paris, France; [Patrat, Catherine] Univ Paris Diderot, Hop Bichat Claude Bernard, Assistance Publ Hop Paris, Serv Biol Reprod, F-75018 Paris, France; [Thepot, Dominique; Peynot, Nathalie; Daniel, Nathalie; Renard, Jean-Paul; Duranthon, Veronique] INRA, UMR Biol Dev & Reprod 1198, F-78352 Jouy En Josas, France; [Diabangouaya, Patricia] Univ Bourgogne, CHU Dijon, Lab Biol Reprod CECOS, F-21079 Dijon, France; [Fauque, Patricia] Inst Curie, INSERM, CNRS UMR 3215, F-75248 Paris, France; [Wolf, Jean-Philippe] Univ Paris 05, Unite 1016, INSERM, Assistance Publ Hop Paris,Serv Biol,Hop Cochin, F-75014 Paris, France","Heard, E (reprint author), Inst Curie, Mammalian Dev Epigenet Grp, CNRS UMR 3215, INSERM,U934, F-75248 Paris, France.",veronique.duranthon@jouy.inra.fr; edith.heard@curie.fr,"Heard, Edith/D-7197-2017","Heard, Edith/0000-0001-8052-7117",FRM (Equipe FRM); ANR; ERC; Agence de Biomedecine; INRA PHASE department,"We thank members of the Heard lab for advice and discussions, V.

To allow a comprehensive analysis of hotspot-associated DNA and chromatin characteristics, we developed a direct molecular approach for mapping meiotic DNA double-strand breaks that initiate recombination. Here we present the genome-wide distribution of recombination initiation sites in the mouse genome. Hotspot centres are mapped with approximately 200-nucleotide precision, which allows analysis of the fine structural details of the preferred recombination sites. We determine that hotspots share a centrally distributed consensus motif, possess a nucleotide skew that changes polarity at the centres of hotspots and have an intrinsic preference to be occupied by a nucleosome. Furthermore, we find that the vast majority of recombination initiation sites in mouse males are associated with testis-specific trimethylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 that is distinct from histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation marks associated with transcription. The recombination map presented here has been derived from a homogeneous mouse population with a defined genetic background and therefore lends itself to extensive future experimental exploration. We note that the mapping technique developed here does not depend on the availability of genetic markers and hence can be easily adapted to other species with complex genomes. Our findings uncover several fundamental features of mammalian recombination hotspots and underline the power of the new recombination map for future studies of genetic recombination, genome stability and evolution.","[Smagulova, Fatima; Petukhova, Galina V.] Uniformed Serv Univ Hlth Sci, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Gregoretti, Ivan V.; Brick, Kevin; Khil, Pavel; Camerini-Otero, R.

Homologies of these bones among jawed vertebrates have long been demonstrated by developmental studies; but fossils illuminating this critical transference are sparse and often ambiguous. Here we report the first unambiguous ectotympanic (angular), malleus (articular and prearticular) and incus (quadrate) of an Early Cretaceous eutriconodont mammal from the Jehol Biota, Liaoning, China. The ectotympanic and malleus have lost their direct contact with the dentary bone but still connect the ossified Meckel's cartilage (OMC); we hypothesize that the OMC serves as a stabilizing mechanism bridging the dentary and the detached ossicles during mammalian evolution. This transitional mammalian middle ear narrows the morphological gap between the mandibular middle ear in basal mammaliaforms and the definitive mammalian middle ear (DMME) of extant mammals; it reveals complex changes contributing to the detachment of ear ossicles during mammalian evolution.","[Meng, Jin] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Paleontol, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Meng, Jin; Wang, Yuanqing; Li, Chuankui] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Paleontol & Paleoanthropol, Key Lab Evolutionary Systemat Vertebrates, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China","Meng, J (reprint author), Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Paleontol, Cent Pk W & 79th St, New York, NY 10024 USA.",jmeng@amnh.org,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology, China [2006CB806400]; National Science Foundation of China [40121202]; Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Science Foundation of USA [EF-0629811]","We thank X.-L.

We examined human patients with loss-of-function mutations in SCN9A and show that they are unable to sense odours. To establish the essential role of Na(v)1.7 in odour perception, we generated conditional null mice in which Na(v)1.7 was removed from all olfactory sensory neurons. In the absence of Na(v)1.7, these neurons still produce odour-evoked action potentials but fail to initiate synaptic signalling from their axon terminals at the first synapse in the olfactory system. The mutant mice no longer display vital, odour-guided behaviours such as innate odour recognition and avoidance, short-term odour learning, and maternal pup retrieval.

However, it is unclear how this map is represented in the olfactory cortex. Here we combine rabies-virus-dependent retrograde mono-trans-synaptic labelling with genetics to control the location, number and type of 'starter' cortical neurons, from which we trace their presynaptic neurons. We find that individual cortical neurons receive input from multiple mitral cells representing broadly distributed glomeruli. Different cortical areas represent the olfactory bulb input differently. For example, the cortical amygdala preferentially receives dorsal olfactory bulb input, whereas the piriform cortex samples the whole olfactory bulb without obvious bias. These differences probably reflect different functions of these cortical areas in mediating innate odour preference or associative memory. The trans-synaptic labelling method described here should be widely applicable to mapping connections throughout the mouse nervous system.","[Miyamichi, Kazunari; Tasic, Bosiljka; Luo, Liqun] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, HHMI, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Amat, Fernando; Moussavi, Farshid; Horowitz, Mark A.] Stanford Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Wang, Chen; He, Zhigang] Childrens Hosp, Dept Neurosci, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Wickersham, Ian; Wall, Nicholas R.; Callaway, Edward M.] Univ Calif San Diego, Salk Inst Biol Studies, Syst Neurobiol Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Wickersham, Ian; Wall, Nicholas R.; Callaway, Edward M.] Univ Calif San Diego, Grad Program Neurosci, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Taniguchi, Hiroki; Huang, Z.

They evolve over time, eventually erupting as the dark cores of coronal mass ejections(2,3). Although coronal mass ejections are common and can significantly affect planetary magnetospheres, the mechanisms by which cavities evolve to an eruptive state remain poorly understood. Recent optical observations(4) of high-latitude 'polar crown' prominences within coronal cavities reveal dark, low-density(5) 'bubbles' that undergo Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities(6,7) to form dark plumes rising into overlying coronal cavities. These observations offered a possible mechanism for coronal cavity evolution, although the nature of the bubbles, particularly their buoyancy, was hitherto unclear. Here we report simultaneous optical and extreme-ultraviolet observations of polar crown prominences that show that these bubbles contain plasma at temperatures in the range (2.5-12) x 10(5) kelvin, which is 25-120 times hotter than the overlying prominence. This identifies a source of the buoyancy, and suggests that the coronal cavity-prominence system supports a novel form of magneto-thermal convection in the solar atmosphere, challenging current hydromagnetic concepts of prominences and their relation to coronal cavities.","[Berger, Thomas; Boerner, Paul; Schrijver, Carolus; Tarbell, Ted; Title, Alan] Lockheed Martin Adv Technol Ctr, Solar & Astrophys Lab, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA; [Testa, Paola] Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Hillier, Andrew; Shibata, Kazunari] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Kwasan Observ, Kyoto 6078471, Japan; [Hillier, Andrew; Shibata, Kazunari] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Hida Observ, Kyoto 6078471, Japan; [Low, Boon Chye] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, High Altitude Observ, Boulder, CO 80307 USA","Berger, T (reprint author), Lockheed Martin Adv Technol Ctr, Solar & Astrophys Lab, O ADBS B 252,3251 Hanover St, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA.",berger@lmsal.com,,,JAXA and NAOJ (Japan); STFC (UK); NASA; ESA; NSC (Norway); Universality and Emergence,"Hinode is a Japanese mission developed and launched by ISAS/JAXA, in collaboration with NAOJ as a domestic partner, and with NASA and STFC (UK) as international partners.

Electron transport runs modern technology, defining states of matter such as superconductors and insulators, and electron spin is being explored as a new carrier of information(1). Neutrino transport energizes supernova explosions following the collapse of a dying star(2), and hydrodynamic transport of the quark-gluon plasma governed the expansion of the early Universe(3). However, our understanding of non-equilibrium dynamics in such strongly interacting fermionic matter is still limited. Ultracold gases of fermionic atoms realize a pristine model for such systems and can be studied in real time with the precision of atomic physics(4). Even above the superfluid transition, such gases flow as an almost perfect fluid with very low viscosity when interactions are tuned to a scattering resonance(3,5-8). In this hydrodynamic regime, collective density excitations are weakly damped(6,7). Here we experimentally investigate spin excitations in a Fermi gas of (6)Li atoms, finding that, in contrast, they are maximally damped. A spin current is induced by spatially separating two spin components and observing their evolution in an external trapping potential. We demonstrate that interactions can be strong enough to reverse spin currents, with components of opposite spin reflecting off each other. Near equilibrium, we obtain the spin drag coefficient, the spin diffusivity and the spin susceptibility as a function of temperature on resonance and show that they obey universal laws at high temperatures. In the degenerate regime, the spin diffusivity approaches a value set by (h) over bar /m, the quantum limit of diffusion, where (h) over bar is Planck's constant divided by 2 pi and m the atomic mass. For repulsive interactions, our measurements seem to exclude a metastable ferromagnetic state(9-11).","[Sommer, Ariel; Ku, Mark; Zwierlein, Martin W.] MIT, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Sommer, Ariel; Ku, Mark; Zwierlein, Martin W.] MIT, MIT Harvard Ctr Ultracold Atoms, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Sommer, Ariel; Ku, Mark; Zwierlein, Martin W.] MIT, Elect Res Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Roati, Giacomo] Univ Florence, CNR, INO, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, Italy; [Roati, Giacomo] Univ Florence, LENS, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, Italy","Sommer, A (reprint author), MIT, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",atsommer@mit.edu,,", /0000-0003-1391-0428",NSF; AFOSR-MURI; ARO-MURI; ONR; DARPA YFA; Army Research Office with DARPA OLE; David and Lucille Packard Foundation; Alfred P.

V.",,,Transient ferromagnetic-like state mediating ultrafast reversal of antiferromagnetically coupled spins,NATURE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,NICKEL,"Ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic spin ordering is governed by the exchange interaction, the strongest force in magnetism(1-4). Understanding spin dynamics in magnetic materials is an issue of crucial importance for progress in information processing and recording technology. Usually the dynamics are studied by observing the collective response of exchange-coupled spins, that is, spin resonances, after an external perturbation by a pulse of magnetic field, current or light. The periods of the corresponding resonances range from one nanosecond for ferromagnets down to one picosecond for antiferromagnets. However, virtually nothing is known about the behaviour of spins in a magnetic material after being excited on a timescale faster than that corresponding to the exchange interaction (10-100 fs), that is, in a non-adiabatic way. Here we use the element-specific technique X-ray magnetic circular dichroism to study spin reversal in GdFeCo that is optically excited on a timescale pertinent to the characteristic time of the exchange interaction between Gd and Fe spins. We unexpectedly find that the ultrafast spin reversal in this material, where spins are coupled antiferromagnetically, occurs by way of a transient ferromagnetic-like state. Following the optical excitation, the net magnetizations of the Gd and Fe sublattices rapidly collapse, switch their direction and rebuild their net magnetic moments at substantially different timescales; the net magnetic moment of the Gd sublattice is found to reverse within 1.5 picoseconds, which is substantially slower than the Fe reversal time of 300 femtoseconds. Consequently, a transient state characterized by a temporary parallel alignment of the net Gd and Fe moments emerges, despite their ground-state antiferromagnetic coupling. These surprising observations, supported by atomistic simulations, provide a concept for the possibility of manipulating magnetic order on the timescale of the exchange interaction.","[Radu, I.; Vahaplar, K.; Kirilyuk, A.; Rasing, Th.; Kimel, A.

We show experimentally that these carbonatite melts are unstable when infiltrating ambient mantle and are reduced to immobile diamond when recycled at depths greater than similar to 250 kilometres, where mantle redox conditions are determined by the presence of an (Fe,Ni) metal phase(4-6). This 'redox freezing' process leads to diamond-enriched mantle domains in which the Fe(0), resulting from Fe(2+) disproportionation in perovskites and garnet, is consumed but the Fe(3+) preserved. When such carbon-enriched mantle heterogeneities become part of the upwelling mantle, diamond will inevitably react with the Fe(3+) leading to true carbonatite redox melting at similar to 660 and similar to 250 kilometres depth to form deep-seated melts in the Earth's mantle.","[Rohrbach, Arno; Schmidt, Max W.] ETH, Inst Geochem & Petrol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland","Rohrbach, A (reprint author), ETH, Inst Geochem & Petrol, Sonneggstr 5, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",arno.rohrbach@gmail.com,,,Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [2-777-86-06],"Discussions with P.

In the olfactory system, distributed neural activity in the nose is converted into a segregated map in the olfactory bulb(1-3). Here we investigate how this ordered representation is transformed in higher olfactory centres in mice. We have developed a tracing strategy to define the neural circuits that convey information from individual glomeruli in the olfactory bulb to the piriform cortex and the cortical amygdala. The spatial order in the bulb is discarded in the piriform cortex; axons from individual glomeruli project diffusely to the piriform without apparent spatial preference. In the cortical amygdala, we observe broad patches of projections that are spatially stereotyped for individual glomeruli. These projections to the amygdala are overlapping and afford the opportunity for spatially localized integration of information from multiple glomeruli. The identification of a distributive pattern of projections to the piriform and stereotyped projections to the amygdala provides an anatomical context for the generation of learned and innate behaviours.","[Sosulski, Dara L.; Bloom, Maria Lissitsyna; Cutforth, Tyler; Axel, Richard; Datta, Sandeep Robert] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Neurosci, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Sosulski, Dara L.; Bloom, Maria Lissitsyna; Cutforth, Tyler; Axel, Richard; Datta, Sandeep Robert] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10032 USA","Axel, R (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Neurosci, New York, NY 10032 USA.",ra27@columbia.edu,,,Burroughs Wellcome Fund; National Institutes of Health [DP2-OD-007109]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Foundation for the National Institutes of Health through the Grand Challenges in Global Health initiative; Helen Hay Whitney Foundation,"We thank members of the R.A. and S.R.D. laboratories for comments and advice, B.

In olfaction, a stereotyped map is evident in the first sensory processing centre, the olfactory bulb (OB), where different odours elicit activity in unique combinatorial patterns of spatially invariant glomeruli(1,2). Activation of each glomerulus is relayed to higher cortical processing centres by a set of similar to 20-50 'homotypic' mitral and tufted (MT) neurons(3). In the cortex, target neurons integrate information from multiple glomeruli to detect distinct features of chemically diverse odours(4-6). How this is accomplished remains unclear, perhaps because the cortical mapping of glomerular information by individual MT neurons has not been described. Here we use new viral tracing and three-dimensional brain reconstruction methods to compare the cortical projections of defined sets of MT neurons. We show that the gross-scale organization of the OB is preserved in the patterns of axonal projections to one processing centre yet reordered in another, suggesting that distinct coding strategies may operate in different targets. However, at the level of individual neurons neither glomerular order nor stereotypy is preserved in either region. Rather, homotypic MT neurons from the same glomerulus innervate broad regions that differ between individuals. Strikingly, even in the same animal, MT neurons exhibit extensive diversity in wiring; axons of homotypic MT pairs diverge from each other, emit primary branches at distinct locations and 70-90% of branches of homotypic and heterotypic pairs are non-overlapping. This pronounced reorganization of sensory maps in the cortex offers an anatomic substrate for expanded combinatorial integration of information from spatially distinct glomeruli and predicts an unanticipated role for diversification of otherwise similar output neurons.","[Ghosh, Sulagna; Hefzi, Hooman; Marnoy, Zachary; Dokka, Kartheek; Baldwin, Kristin K.] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Cell Biol, Dorris Neurosci Ctr, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Larson, Stephen D.] Univ Calif San Diego, Natl Ctr Microscopy & Imaging Res, Program Neurosci, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Cutforth, Tyler] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Mol Cell & Dev Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA","Baldwin, KK (reprint author), Scripps Res Inst, Dept Cell Biol, Dorris Neurosci Ctr, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",kbaldwin@scripps.edu,,,Pew Scholars Award; California Institute of Regenerative Medicine; Whitehall Foundation; O'Keefe Foundation; Shapiro Family Foundation; Dorris Neuroscience Center,"We wish to thank G.

HGPS is caused by a single point mutation in the lamin A (LMNA) gene, resulting in the generation of progerin, a truncated splicing mutant of lamin A. Accumulation of progerin leads to various ageing-associated nuclear defects including disorganization of nuclear lamina and loss of heterochromatin(9-12). Here we report the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from fibroblasts obtained from patients with HGPS. HGPS-iPSCs show absence of progerin, and more importantly, lack the nuclear envelope and epigenetic alterations normally associated with premature ageing. Upon differentiation of HGPS-iPSCs, progerin and its ageing-associated phenotypic consequences are restored. Specifically, directed differentiation of HGPS-iPSCs to SMCs leads to the appearance of premature senescence phenotypes associated with vascular ageing. Additionally, our studies identify DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNAPKcs, also known as PRKDC) as a downstream target of progerin. The absence of nuclear DNAPK holoenzyme correlates with premature as well as physiological ageing. Because progerin also accumulates during physiological ageing(6,12,13), our results provide an in vitro iPSC-based model to study the pathogenesis of human premature and physiological vascular ageing.","[Liu, Guang-Hui; Barkho, Basam Z.; Ruiz, Sergio; Qu, Jing; Yang, Sheng-Lian; Panopoulos, Athanasia D.; Suzuki, Keiichiro; Kurian, Leo; Walsh, Christopher; Sancho-Martinez, Ignacio; Izpisua Belmonte, Juan Carlos] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Gene Express Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Diep, Dinh; Fung, Ho Lim; Zhang, Kun] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Bioengn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Thompson, James; Yates, John, III] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Cell Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Boue, Stephanie; Izpisua Belmonte, Juan Carlos] Ctr Regenerat Med Barcelona, Barcelona 08003, Spain","Belmonte, JCI (reprint author), Salk Inst Biol Studies, Gene Express Lab, 10010 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",belmonte@salk.edu,"Kurian, Leo/M-1598-2014; Ruiz, Sergio/G-1561-2016","Kurian, Leo/0000-0001-7466-5169; Ruiz, Sergio/0000-0002-0177-6965; Sancho-Martinez, Ignacio/0000-0003-4348-1038; Boue, Stephanie/0000-0003-0680-4168","CIRM [TG2-01158]; AFAR/Ellison Medical Foundation; NIH [T32 CA009370, R01-DA025779, P41 RR011823]; G.

Collapse of protein homeostasis results in protein misfolding cascades and the accumulation of insoluble protein fibrils and aggregates, such as amyloids(2).

We proposed that treating animals with such compounds would promote protein homeostasis in vivo and increase longevity. Here we show that exposure of adult Caenorhabditis elegans to the amyloid-binding dye Thioflavin T (ThT) resulted in a profoundly extended lifespan and slowed ageing. ThT also suppressed pathological features of mutant metastable proteins and human beta-amyloid-associated toxicity. These beneficial effects of ThT depend on the protein homeostasis network regulator heat shock factor 1 (HSF-1), the stress resistance and longevity transcription factor SKN-1, molecular chaperones, autophagy and proteosomal functions.

AMPK has been implicated in a number of diseases related to energy metabolism including type 2 diabetes, obesity and, most recently, cancer(2-6). AMPK is converted from an inactive form to a catalytically competent form by phosphorylation of the activation loop within the kinase domain(7): AMP binding to the c-regulatory domain promotes phosphorylation by the upstream kinase(8), protects the enzyme against dephosphorylation, as well as causing allosteric activation(9). Here we show that ADP binding to just one of the two exchangeable AXP (AMP/ADP/ATP) binding sites on the regulatory domain protects the enzyme from dephosphorylation, although it does not lead to allosteric activation. Our studies show that active mammalian AMPK displays significantly tighter binding to ADP than to MgATP, explaining how the enzyme is regulated under physiological conditions where the concentration of Mg-ATP is higher than that of ADP and much higher than that of AMP. We have determined the crystal structure of an active AMPK complex. The structure shows how the activation loop of the kinase domain is stabilized by the regulatory domain and how the kinase linker region interacts with the regulatory nucleotide-binding site that mediates protection against dephosphorylation. From our biochemical and structural data we develop a model for how the energy status of a cell regulates AMPK activity.","[Sanders, Matthew J.; Mayer, Faith V.; Carmena, David; Carling, David] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, MRC, Ctr Clin Sci, London W12 0NN, England; [Xiao, Bing; Underwood, Elizabeth; Heath, Richard; Jing, Chun; Walker, Philip A.; Eccleston, John F.; Haire, Lesley F.; Saiu, Peter; Howell, Steven A.; Aasland, Rein; Martin, Stephen R.; Gamblin, Steven J.] Natl Inst Med Res, MRC, London NW7 1AA, England","Carling, D (reprint author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, MRC, Ctr Clin Sci, Hammersmith Hosp Campus,DuCane Rd, London W12 0NN, England.",david.carling@csc.mrc.ac.uk; sgambli@nimr.mrc.ac.uk,"Carling, David/F-1943-2014","Carling, David/0000-0002-2316-1830; Gamblin, Steven/0000-0001-5331-639X; Carmena, David/0000-0002-4015-8553",MRC,"We thank M.

The centromere is marked by a conserved variant of conventional histone H3 termed CenH3 or CENP-A (ref. 2). A conserved motif of CenH3, the CATD, defined by loop 1 and helix 2 of the histone fold, is necessary and sufficient for specifying centromere functions of CenH3 (refs 3, 4). The structural basis of this specification is of particular interest. Yeast Scm3 and human HJURP are conserved non-histone proteins that interact physically with the (CenH3-H4) 2 heterotetramer and are required for the deposition of CenH3 at centromeres in vivo(5-13). Here we have elucidated the structural basis for recognition of budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) CenH3 (called Cse4) by Scm3. We solved the structure of the Cse4-binding domain (CBD) of Scm3 in complex with Cse4 and H4 in a single chain model. An alpha-helix and an irregular loop at the conserved amino terminus and a shorter alpha-helix at the carboxy terminus of Scm3(CBD) wraps around the Cse4-H4 dimer. Four Cse4-specific residues in the N-terminal region of helix 2 are sufficient for specific recognition by conserved and functionally important residues in the N-terminal helix of Scm3 through formation of a hydrophobic cluster. Scm3(CBD) induces major conformational changes and sterically occludes DNA-binding sites in the structure of Cse4 and H4. These findings have implications for the assembly and architecture of the centromeric nucleosome.","[Zhou, Zheng; Feng, Hanqiao; Zhou, Bing-Rui; Xiao, Hua; Wu, Carl; Bai, Yawen] NCI, Biochem & Mol Biol Lab, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Ghirlando, Rodolfo] NIDDKD, Mol Biol Lab, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Hu, Kaifeng] Univ Wisconsin, Natl Magnet Resonance Facil Madison, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Zwolak, Adam; Tjandra, Nico] NHLBI, Lab Mol Biophys, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Jenkins, Lisa M.

The superfamily 2 DEAD-box ATPase Dbp5 (human DDX19) functions in mRNA export and is thought to remodel mRNPs at the nuclear pore complex (NPC)(3-8). Dbp5 is localized to the NPC via an interaction with Nup159 (NUP214 in vertebrates)(3-5,8,9) and is locally activated there by Gle1 together with the small-molecule inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP(6))(10,11). Local activation of Dbp5 at the NPC by Gle1 is essential for mRNA export in vivo(10,12); however, the mechanistic role of Dbp5 in mRNP export is poorly understood and it is not known how Gle1(InsP6) and Nup159 regulate the activity of Dbp5. Here we report, from yeast, structures of Dbp5 in complex with Gle1(InsP6), Nup159/Gle1(InsP6) and RNA. These structures reveal that InsP6 functions as a small-molecule tether for the Gle1-Dbp5 interaction. Surprisingly, the Gle1(InsP6)-Dbp5 complex is structurally similar to another DEAD-box ATPase complex essential for translation initiation, eIF4G-eIF4A, and we demonstrate that Gle1(InsP6) and eIF4G both activate their DEAD-box partner by stimulating RNA release. Furthermore, Gle1(InsP6) relieves Dbp5 autoregulation and cooperates with Nup159 in stabilizing an open Dbp5 intermediate that precludes RNA binding. These findings explain how Gle1(InsP6), Nup159 and Dbp5 collaborate in mRNA export and provide a general mechanism for DEAD-box ATPase regulation by Gle1/eIF4G-like activators.","[Montpetit, Ben; Helmke, Kara J.; Weis, Karsten] Univ Calif Berkeley, Div Cell & Dev Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Montpetit, Ben; Thomsen, Nathan D.; Helmke, Kara J.; Seeliger, Markus A.; Berger, James M.; Weis, Karsten] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Montpetit, Ben; Thomsen, Nathan D.; Helmke, Kara J.; Seeliger, Markus A.; Berger, James M.; Weis, Karsten] Univ Calif Berkeley, QB3 Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Thomsen, Nathan D.; Seeliger, Markus A.; Berger, James M.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Div Biochem & Mol Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Weis, K (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Div Cell & Dev Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",jmberger@berkeley.edu; kweis@berkeley.edu,"Weis, Karsten/F-5719-2011; Seeliger, Markus/D-6409-2013","Weis, Karsten/0000-0001-7224-925X; Montpetit, Ben/0000-0002-8317-983X","G Harold and Leila Y Mathers foundation; NIH [R01GM58065, RC1GM91533]","We thank J.

Here we report the crystal structure of a representative NAT protein, the Escherichia coli uracil/H+ symporter UraA, in complex with uracil at a resolution of 2.8 angstrom. UraA has a novel structural fold, with 14 transmembrane segments (TMs) divided into two inverted repeats. A pair of antiparallel beta-strands is located between TM3 and TM10 and has an important role in structural organization and substrate recognition. The structure is spatially arranged into a core domain and a gate domain. Uracil, located at the interface between the two domains, is coordinated mainly by residues from the core domain. Structural analysis suggests that alternating access of the substrate may be achieved through conformational changes of the gate domain.","[Lu, Feiran; Li, Shuo; Jiang, Yang; Jiang, Jing; Fan, He; Lu, Guifeng; Deng, Dong; Dang, Shangyu; Zhang, Xu; Wang, Jiawei; Yan, Nieng] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Life Sci, Struct Biol Ctr, State Key Lab Biomembrane & Membrane Biotechnol, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Lu, Feiran; Li, Shuo; Jiang, Yang; Jiang, Jing; Fan, He; Lu, Guifeng; Deng, Dong; Dang, Shangyu; Zhang, Xu; Wang, Jiawei; Yan, Nieng] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Med, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China","Yan, NE (reprint author), Tsinghua Univ, Sch Life Sci, Struct Biol Ctr, State Key Lab Biomembrane & Membrane Biotechnol, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",nyan@tsinghua.edu.cn,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology [2009CB918802, 2011CB910501]; Tsinghua University; National Natural Science Foundation of China [91017011]; Yuyuan Foundation; Li Foundation","We thank N.

It is currently unclear how individual, localized parts are able to coordinate with each other to develop a whole organ shape. Here we report the dynamic, autonomous formation of the optic cup (retinal primordium) structure from a three-dimensional culture of mouse embryonic stem cell aggregates. Embryonic-stem-cell-derived retinal epithelium spontaneously formed hemispherical epithelial vesicles that became patterned along their proximal-distal axis. Whereas the proximal portion differentiated into mechanically rigid pigment epithelium, the flexible distal portion progressively folded inward to form a shape reminiscent of the embryonic optic cup, exhibited interkinetic nuclear migration and generated stratified neural retinal tissue, as seen in vivo. We demonstrate that optic-cup morphogenesis in this simple cell culture depends on an intrinsic self-organizing program involving stepwise and domain-specific regulation of local epithelial properties.","[Eiraku, Mototsugu; Takata, Nozomu; Kawada, Masako; Sakakura, Eriko; Sasai, Yoshiki] RIKEN Ctr Dev Biol, Organogenesis & Neurogenesis Grp, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan; [Eiraku, Mototsugu; Sakakura, Eriko; Sasai, Yoshiki] RIKEN Ctr Dev Biol, Dimens Tissue Anal Unit 4, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan; [Ishibashi, Hiroki; Okuda, Satoru; Adachi, Taiji] Kyoto Univ, Inst Frontier Med Sci, Dept Biomech, Kyoto 6068507, Japan; [Sekiguchi, Kiyotoshi] Osaka Univ, Inst Prot Res, Lab Extracellular Matrix Biochem, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Adachi, Taiji] RIKEN, VCAD Syst Res Program, Computat Cell Biomech Team, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan","Eiraku, M (reprint author), RIKEN Ctr Dev Biol, Organogenesis & Neurogenesis Grp, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan.",eiraku@cdb.riken.jp; yoshikisasai@cdb.riken.jp,,,MEXT; Knowledge Cluster Initiative at Kobe; S-Innovation Project; Leading Project for Realization of Regenerative Medicine,"We are grateful to S.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) represents the leading cause of death and morbidity worldwide. Here we used a metabolomics approach to generate unbiased small-molecule metabolic profiles in plasma that predict risk for CVD. Three metabolites of the dietary lipid phosphatidylcholine-choline, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) and betaine-were identified and then shown to predict risk for CVD in an independent large clinical cohort. Dietary supplementation of mice with choline, TMAO or betaine promoted upregulation of multiple macrophage scavenger receptors linked to atherosclerosis, and supplementation with choline or TMAO promoted atherosclerosis. Studies using germ-free mice confirmed a critical role for dietary choline and gut flora in TMAO production, augmented macrophage cholesterol accumulation and foam cell formation. Suppression of intestinal microflora in atherosclerosis-prone mice inhibited dietary-choline-enhanced atherosclerosis. Genetic variations controlling expression of flavin monooxygenases, an enzymatic source of TMAO, segregated with atherosclerosis in hyperlipidaemic mice. Discovery of a relationship between gut-flora-dependent metabolism of dietary phosphatidylcholine and CVD pathogenesis provides opportunities for the development of new diagnostic tests and therapeutic approaches for atherosclerotic heart disease.","[Wang, Zeneng; Klipfell, Elizabeth; Koeth, Robert; Levison, Bruce S.; Dugar, Brandon; Feldstein, Ariel E.; Britt, Earl B.; Fu, Xiaoming; Chung, Yoon-Mi; Smith, Jonathan D.; Tang, W.

So far, most experimental studies of optomechanics have focused on measurement and control of the mechanical subsystem through its interaction with optics, and have led to the experimental demonstration of dynamical back-action cooling and optical rigidity of the mechanical system(1,3). Conversely, the optical response of these systems is also modified in the presence of mechanical interactions, leading to effects such as electromagnetically induced transparency(4) (EIT) and parametric normal-mode splitting(5). In atomic systems, studies(6,7) of slow and stopped light (applicable to modern optical networks(8) and future quantum networks(9)) have thrust EIT to the forefront of experimental study during the past two decades. Here we demonstrate EIT and tunable optical delays in a nanoscale optomechanical crystal, using the optomechanical nonlinearity to control the velocity of light by way of engineered photon-phonon interactions. Our device is fabricated by simply etching holes into a thin film of silicon. At low temperature (8.7 kelvin), we report an optically tunable delay of 50 nanoseconds with near-unity optical transparency, and superluminal light with a 1.4 microsecond signal advance. These results, while indicating significant progress towards an integrated quantum optomechanical memory(10), are also relevant to classical signal processing applications. Measurements at room temperature in the analogous regime of electromagnetically induced absorption show the utility of these chip-scale optomechanical systems for optical buffering, amplification, and filtering of microwave-over-optical signals.","[Safavi-Naeini, A.

In particular, high-performance graphene transistors for radio-frequency (r.f.) applications are of great interest(6-13). Synthesis of large-scale graphene sheets of high quality and at low cost has been demonstrated using chemical vapour deposition (CVD) methods(14). However, very few studies have been performed on the scaling behaviour of transistors made from CVD graphene for r.f. applications, which hold great potential for commercialization. Here we report the systematic study of top-gated CVD-graphene r.f. transistors with gate lengths scaled down to 40 nm, the shortest gate length demonstrated on graphene r.f. devices. The CVD graphene was grown on copper film and transferred to a wafer of diamond-like carbon. Cut-off frequencies as high as 155 GHz have been obtained for the 40-nm transistors, and the cut-off frequency was found to scale as 1/(gate length). Furthermore, we studied graphene r.f. transistors at cryogenic temperatures. Unlike conventional semiconductor devices where low-temperature performance is hampered by carrier freeze-out effects, the r.f. performance of our graphene devices exhibits little temperature dependence down to 4.3 K, providing a much larger operation window than is available for conventional devices.","[Wu, Yanqing; Lin, Yu-ming; Bol, Ageeth A.; Jenkins, Keith A.; Xia, Fengnian; Farmer, Damon B.; Zhu, Yu; Avouris, Phaedon] IBM Corp, Thomas J Watson Res Ctr, Yorktown Hts, NY 10598 USA","Lin, YM (reprint author), IBM Corp, Thomas J Watson Res Ctr, Yorktown Hts, NY 10598 USA.",yming@us.ibm.com; avouris@us.ibm.com,"WU, Yanqing/C-9737-2009; Xia, Fengnian/D-1003-2012; Bol, Ageeth/E-3071-2014; Xia, Fengnian/O-2637-2015","Xia, Fengnian/0000-0001-5176-368X; Bol, Ageeth/0000-0002-1259-6265",DARPA [FA8650-08-C-7838],"We thank T.

The upper crust of the Tibetan Plateau is generally thought to be poorly coupled to the underthrusting Indian crust because of an intervening low-viscosity channel(1). Here, however, we show that the contrast in tectonic regime between primarily strike-slip faulting in northern Tibet and dominantly normal faulting in southern Tibet requires mechanical coupling between the upper crust of southern Tibet and the underthrusting Indian crust. Such coupling is inconsistent with the presence of active 'channel flow' beneath southern Tibet, and suggests that the Indian crust retains its strength as it underthrusts the plateau. These results shed new light on the debates regarding the mechanical properties of the continental lithosphere(2-4), and the deformation of Tibet(1,5-10).","[Copley, Alex; Avouac, Jean-Philippe; Wernicke, Brian P.] CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, Tecton Observ, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Copley, A (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Earth Sci, Bullard Labs, Cambridge CB3 0EZ, England.",acc41@cam.ac.uk,"NCEO, COMET+`/A-3443-2013; Avouac, Jean-Philippe/B-5699-2015","Avouac, Jean-Philippe/0000-0002-3060-8442; Copley, Alex/0000-0003-0362-0494",Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation through the Caltech Tectonics Observatory; Pembroke College in the University of Cambridge,"We thank the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation for support through the Caltech Tectonics Observatory, and Pembroke College in the University of Cambridge for financial support to A.C.

In California, the fault is composed of two distinct locked segments that have produced great earthquakes in historical times, separated by a 150-km-long creeping zone. The San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD) is a scientific borehole located northwest of Parkfield, California, near the southern end of the creeping zone. Core was recovered from across the actively deforming San Andreas fault at a vertical depth of 2.7 km (ref. 1). Here we report laboratory strength measurements of these fault core materials at in situ conditions, demonstrating that at this locality and this depth the San Andreas fault is profoundly weak (coefficient of friction, 0.15) owing to the presence of the smectite clay mineral saponite, which is one of the weakest phyllosilicates known. This Mg-rich clay is the low-temperature product of metasomatic reactions between the quartzofeldspathic wall rocks and serpentinite blocks in the fault(2,3). These findings provide strong evidence that deformation of the mechanically unusual creeping portions of the San Andreas fault system is controlled by the presence of weak minerals rather than by high fluid pressure or other proposed mechanisms(1). The combination of these measurements of fault core strength with borehole observations(1,4,5) yields a self-consistent picture of the stress state of the San Andreas fault at the SAFOD site, in which the fault is intrinsically weak in an otherwise strong crust.","[Lockner, David A.; Morrow, Carolyn; Moore, Diane; Hickman, Stephen] US Geol Survey, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA","Lockner, DA (reprint author), US Geol Survey, 345 Middlefield Rd, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA.",dlockner@usgs.gov,,,,,,28,149,153,9,60,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,7-Apr,2011,472,7341,,,,,82,U107,,10.1038/nature09927,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,745VV,WOS:000289199400041,21441903.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,stephen,hickman,male,1,2608,na,na

Over the past two decades, much research has shown that ecosystems with more species are more efficient at removing nutrients from soil and water than are ecosystems with fewer species(4-7). This has led some to suggest that conservation of biodiversity might be a useful tool for managing nutrient uptake and storage(7-10), but this suggestion has been controversial, in part because the specific biological mechanisms by which species diversity influences nutrient uptake have not been identified(10-12). Here I use a model system of stream biofilms to show that niche partitioning among species of algae can increase the uptake and storage of nitrate, a nutrient pollutant of global concern. I manipulated the number of species of algae growing in the biofilms of 150 stream mesocosms that had been set up to mimic the variety of flow habitats and disturbance regimes that are typical of natural streams. Nitrogen uptake rates, as measured by using (15)N-labelled nitrate, increased linearly with species richness and were driven by niche differences among species. As different forms of algae came to dominate each unique habitat in a stream, the more diverse communities achieved a higher biomass and greater (15)N uptake. When these niche opportunities were experimentally removed by making all of the habitats in a stream uniform, diversity did not influence nitrogen uptake, and biofilms collapsed to a single dominant species. These results provide direct evidence that communities with more species take greater advantage of the niche opportunities in an environment, and this allows diverse systems to capture a greater proportion of biologically available resources such as nitrogen. One implication is that biodiversity may help to buffer natural ecosystems against the ecological impacts of nutrient pollution.","Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Cardinale, BJ (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",bradcard@umich.edu,,,"US National Science Foundation [DEB 0614428, DEB 1046121]","We thank J.

In tumours, where genetic heterogeneity is common(1-3), very important information may be lost that would be useful for reconstructing evolutionary history. Here we show that with flow-sorted nuclei, whole genome amplification and next generation sequencing we can accurately quantify genomic copy number within an individual nucleus. We apply single-nucleus sequencing to investigate tumour population structure and evolution in two human breast cancer cases. Analysis of 100 single cells from a polygenomic tumour revealed three distinct clonal subpopulations that probably represent sequential clonal expansions. Additional analysis of 100 single cells from a monogenomic primary tumour and its liver metastasis indicated that a single clonal expansion formed the primary tumour and seeded the metastasis. In both primary tumours, we also identified an unexpectedly abundant subpopulation of genetically diverse 'pseudodiploid' cells that do not travel to the metastatic site. In contrast to gradual models of tumour progression, our data indicate that tumours grow by punctuated clonal expansions with few persistent intermediates.","[Navin, Nicholas; Kendall, Jude; Troge, Jennifer; Andrews, Peter; Rodgers, Linda; McIndoo, Jeanne; Cook, Kerry; Stepansky, Asya; Levy, Dan; Esposito, Diane; Krasnitz, Alex; McCombie, W.

Here we report that the neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) is required for male sexual preference. Wild-type male mice preferred females over males, but males lacking central serotonergic neurons lost sexual preference although they were not generally defective in olfaction or in pheromone sensing. A role for 5-HT was demonstrated by the phenotype of mice lacking tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (Tph2), which is required for the first step of 5-HT synthesis in the brain. Thirty-five minutes after the injection of the intermediate 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), which circumvented Tph2 to restore 5-HT to the wildtype level, adult Tph2 knockout mice also preferred females over males.

Here we used two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy(11-13) to monitor the activity of two Rho GTPases-RhoA and Cdc42-in single dendritic spines undergoing structural plasticity associated with long-term potentiation in CA1 pyramidal neurons in cultured slices of rat hippocampus. When long-term volume increase was induced in a single spine using two-photon glutamate uncaging(14,15), RhoA and Cdc42 were rapidly activated in the stimulated spine. These activities decayed over about five minutes, and were then followed by a phase of persistent activation lasting more than half an hour. Although active RhoA and Cdc42 were similarly mobile, their activity patterns were different. RhoA activation diffused out of the stimulated spine and spread over about 5 mm along the dendrite. In contrast, Cdc42 activation was restricted to the stimulated spine, and exhibited a steep gradient at the spine necks. Inhibition of the Rho-Rock pathway preferentially inhibited the initial spine growth, whereas the inhibition of the Cdc42-Pak pathway blocked the maintenance of sustained structural plasticity. RhoA and Cdc42 activation depended on Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase (CaMKII). Thus, RhoA and Cdc42 relay transient CaMKII activation(13) to synapse-specific, long-term signalling required for spine structural plasticity.","[Murakoshi, Hideji; Wang, Hong; Yasuda, Ryohei] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Neurobiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Yasuda, Ryohei] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Durham, NC 27710 USA","Yasuda, R (reprint author), Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Neurobiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA.",yasuda@neuro.duke.edu,"Yasuda, Ryohei/E-7726-2011",,Howard Hughes Medical Institute; National Institute of Mental Health; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke; National Institute of Drug Abuse; Alzheimer's Association; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science,"We thank K.

Thymocyte cell fate is dictated by the nature of TCR-major-histocompatibility-complex (MHC)-peptide interactions, with signals of higher strength leading to death (negative selection) and signals of intermediate strength leading to differentiation (positive selection)(1). Molecules that regulate T-cell development by modulating TCR signal strength have been described but components that specifically define the boundaries between positive and negative selection remain unknown. Here we show in mice that repression of TCR-induced death pathways is critical for proper interpretation of positive selecting signals in vivo, and identify schnurri-2 (Shn2; also known as Hivep2) as a crucial death dampener. Our results indicate that Shn2(-/-) double-positive thymocytes inappropriately undergo negative selection in response to positive selecting signals, thus leading to disrupted T-cell development. Shn2(-/-) double-positive thymocytes are more sensitive to TCR-induced death in vitro and die in response to positive selection interactions in vivo. However, Shn2-deficient thymocytes can be positively selected when TCR-induced death is genetically ablated. Shn2 levels increase after TCR stimulation, indicating that integration of multiple TCR-MHC-peptide interactions may fine-tune the death threshold. Mechanistically, Shn2 functions downstream of TCR proximal signalling compenents to dampen Bax activation and the mitochondrial death pathway. Our findings uncover a critical regulator of T-cell development that controls the balance between death and differentiation.","[Staton, Tracy L.; Lazarevic, Vanja; Jones, Dallas C.; Lanser, Amanda J.; Glimcher, Laurie H.] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Immunol & Infect Dis, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Takagi, Tsuyoshi; Ishii, Shunsuke] RIKEN Tsukuba Inst, Mol Genet Lab, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050074, Japan; [Glimcher, Laurie H.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Glimcher, Laurie H.] Ragon Inst MGH MIT & Harvard, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA","Glimcher, LH (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Immunol & Infect Dis, 665 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",lglimche@hsph.harvard.edu,"Lazarevic, Vanja/B-1160-2009; Ishii, Shunsuke/A-5271-2016","Ishii, Shunsuke/0000-0002-6530-2478","National Institutes of Health [AI29673, K99AR055668]",The authors thank R.

Although the epithelia of organs such as the intestine regenerate constantly and thus remain continuously proliferative(1), other organs, such as the mammalian urinary bladder, shift from near-quiescence to a highly proliferative state in response to epithelial injury(2-4). The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this injury-induced mode of regenerative response are poorly defined. Here we show in mice that the proliferative response to bacterial infection or chemical injury within the bladder is regulated by signal feedback between basal cells of the urothelium and the stromal cells that underlie them. We demonstrate that these basal cells include stem cells capable of regenerating all cell types within the urothelium, and are marked by expression of the secreted protein signal Sonic hedgehog (Shh). On injury, Shh expression in these basal cells increases and elicits increased stromal expression of Wnt protein signals, which in turn stimulate the proliferation of both urothelial and stromal cells. The heightened activity of this signal feedback circuit and the associated increase in cell proliferation appear to be required for restoration of urothelial function and, in the case of bacterial injury, may help clear and prevent further spread of infection. Our findings provide a conceptual framework for injury-induced epithelial regeneration in endodermal organs, and may provide a basis for understanding the roles of signalling pathways in cancer growth and metastasis.","[Shin, Kunyoo; Lee, John; Kim, James; Lim, Agnes; Qu, Lishu; Beachy, Philip A.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Inst Stem Cell Biol & Regenerat Med,Dept Dev Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Guo, Nini] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Mysorekar, Indira U.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA","Beachy, PA (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Inst Stem Cell Biol & Regenerat Med,Dept Dev Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",kunyoos@stanford.edu; pbeachy@stanford.edu,,"Lim, Agnes/0000-0002-6618-2500",Department of Defense; National Institutes of Health; Pathway to Independence Award [K99/R00],"We thank A.

However, it is not clear how this is achieved. Here we show that in Arabidopsis seedlings subjected to heat stress, a copia-type retrotransposon named ONSEN (Japanese 'hot spring') not only became transcriptionally active but also synthesized extrachromosomal DNA copies. Heat-induced ONSEN accumulation was stimulated in mutants impaired in the biogenesis of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs); however, there was no evidence of transposition occurring in vegetative tissues. After stress, both ONSEN transcripts and extrachromosomal DNA gradually decayed and were no longer detected after 20-30 days. Surprisingly, a high frequency of new ONSEN insertions was observed in the progeny of stressed plants deficient in siRNAs. Insertion patterns revealed that this transgenerational retrotransposition occurred during flower development and before gametogenesis. Therefore in plants with compromised siRNA biogenesis, memory of stress was maintained throughout development, priming ONSEN to transpose during differentiation of generative organs. Retrotransposition was not observed in the progeny of wild-type plants subjected to stress or in non-stressed mutant controls, pointing to a crucial role of the siRNA pathway in restricting retrotransposition triggered by environmental stress.

Potential roles of lincRNAs in gene activation are much less understood(3-5). Development and homeostasis require coordinate regulation of neighbouring genes through a process termed locus control(6). Some locus control elements and enhancers transcribe lincRNAs(7-10), hinting at possible roles in long-range control. In vertebrates, 39 Hox genes, encoding homeodomain transcription factors critical for positional identity, are clustered in four chromosomal loci; the Hox genes are expressed in nested anterior-posterior and proximal-distal patterns colinear with their genomic position from 3' to 5' of the cluster(11). Here we identify HOTTIP, a lincRNA transcribed from the 5' tip of the HOXA locus that coordinates the activation of several 5' HOXA genes in vivo. Chromosomal looping brings HOTTIP into close proximity to its target genes. HOTTIP RNA binds the adaptor protein WDR5 directly and targets WDR5/MLL complexes across HOXA, driving histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation and gene transcription. Induced proximity is necessary and sufficient for HOTTIP RNA activation of its target genes. Thus, by serving as key intermediates that transmit information from higher order chromosomal looping into chromatin modifications, lincRNAs may organize chromatin domains to coordinate long-range gene activation.","[Wang, Kevin C.; Yang, Yul W.; Corces-Zimmerman, Ryan; Protacio, Angeline; Flynn, Ryan A.; Gupta, Rajnish A.; Chang, Howard Y.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Program Epithelial Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Wang, Kevin C.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Dermatol, San Francisco, CA 94115 USA; [Liu, Bo; Helms, Jill A.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Surg, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Sanyal, Amartya; Lajoie, Bryan R.; Dekker, Job] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Pharmacol, Program Gene Funct & Express, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Chen, Yong; Lei, Ming] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biol Chem, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Wysocka, Joanna] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Chem & Syst Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Chang, HY (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Program Epithelial Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",howchang@stanford.edu,"SANYAL, AMARTYA/D-7240-2015","SANYAL, AMARTYA/0000-0002-2109-4478; Corces, Michael/0000-0001-7465-7652; Flynn, Ryan/0000-0001-5013-0442; chen, yong/0000-0001-5857-6086",California Institute for Regenerative Medicine; National Institutes of Health [HG003143]; Scleroderma Research Foundation; Dermatology Foundation; W.

Although some crystal structures have been determined for GPCRs, most are for modified forms, showing little basal activity, and are bound to inverse agonists or antagonists. Consequently, these structures correspond to receptors in their inactive states. The visual pigment rhodopsin is the only GPCR for which structures exist that are thought to be in the active state(1),(2). However, these structures are for the apoprotein, or opsin, form that does not contain the agonist all-trans retinal. Here we present a crystal structure at a resolution of 3 angstrom for the constitutively active rhodopsin mutant Glu 113 Gln(3-5) in complex with a peptide derived from the carboxy terminus of the alpha-subunit of the G protein transducin. The protein is in an active conformation that retains retinal in the binding pocket after photoactivation. Comparison with the structure of ground-state rhodopsin(6) suggests how translocation of the retinal beta-ionone ring leads to a rotation of transmembrane helix 6, which is the critical conformational change on activation(7). A key feature of this conformational change is a reorganization of water-mediated hydrogen-bond networks between the retinal-binding pocket and three of the most conserved GPCR sequence motifs. We thus show how an agonist ligand can activate its GPCR.","[Standfuss, Jorg; Fransen, Maikel; Schertler, Gebhard F.X.] Paul Scherrer Inst, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland; [Standfuss, Jorg; Edwards, Patricia C.; Schertler, Gebhard F.X.] MRC, Lab Mol Biol, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England; [D'Antona, Aaron; Xie, Guifu; Oprian, Daniel D.] Brandeis Univ, Dept Biochem, Waltham, MA 02454 USA; [D'Antona, Aaron; Xie, Guifu; Oprian, Daniel D.] Brandeis Univ, Volen Ctr Complex Syst, Waltham, MA 02454 USA","Standfuss, J (reprint author), Paul Scherrer Inst, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland.",,"Standfuss, Joerg/G-5126-2011; Schertler, Gebhard/M-9512-2014","Schertler, Gebhard F.X./0000-0002-5846-6810","Medical Research Council [MC_U105197215, MC_U105178937]; NEI NIH HHS [EY007965, R01 EY007965]; NINDS NIH HHS [T32 NS007292]",,,30,285,286,3,47,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,31-Mar,2011,471,7340,,,,,656,660,,10.1038/nature09795,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,742NN,WOS:000288951200049,21389983.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,gebhard f.x.,schertler,na,na,na,na,na

Recently linear ubiquitin chains assembled by a complex containing HOIL-1 and HOIP (also known as RBCK1 and RNF31, respectively) were implicated in TNF signalling, yet their relevance in vivo remained uncertain. Here we identify SHARPIN as a third component of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex, recruited to the CD40 and TNF receptor signalling complexes together with its other constituents, HOIL-1 and HOIP. Mass spectrometry of TNF signalling complexes revealed RIP1 (also known as RIPK1) and NEMO (also known as IKK gamma or IKBKG) to be linearly ubiquitinated. Mutation of the Sharpin gene (Sharpin(cpdm/cpdm)) causes chronic proliferative dermatitis (cpdm) characterized by inflammatory skin lesions and defective lymphoid organogenesis. Gene induction by TNF, CD40 ligand and interleukin-1 beta was attenuated in cpdm-derived cells which were rendered sensitive to TNF-induced death. Importantly, Tnf gene deficiency prevented skin lesions in cpdm mice. We conclude that by enabling linear ubiquitination in the TNF receptor signalling complex, SHARPIN interferes with TNF-induced cell death and, thereby, prevents inflammation. Our results provide evidence for the relevance of linear ubiquitination in vivo in preventing inflammation and regulating immune signalling.","[Gerlach, Bjoern; Cordier, Stefanie M.; Schmukle, Anna C.; Emmerich, Christoph H.; Rieser, Eva; Walczak, Henning] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Med, Tumour Immunol Unit, London W12 0NN, England; [Gerlach, Bjoern; Emmerich, Christoph H.; Haas, Tobias L.; Walczak, Henning] German Canc Res Ctr, Div Apoptosis Regulat, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Haas, Tobias L.] Mediterranean Inst Oncol, Dept Expt Oncol, I-95029 Viagrande, Italy; [Webb, Andrew I.; Purcell, Anthony W.] Bio21 Melbourne Univ, Dept Biochem, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Rickard, James A.; Anderton, Holly; Wong, Wendy W-L.; Nachbur, Ueli; Gangoda, Lahiru; Silke, John] La Trobe Univ, Dept Biochem, Melbourne, Vic 3086, Australia; [Warnken, Uwe] German Canc Res Ctr, Prot Anal Core Facil, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany","Walczak, H (reprint author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Med, Tumour Immunol Unit, London W12 0NN, England.",h.walczak@imperial.ac.uk,"Silke, John/B-7622-2008","Silke, John/0000-0002-7611-5774; Gangoda, Lahiru/0000-0003-1931-6809; Purcell, Anthony/0000-0003-0532-8331; Wong, W.

Here we report markedly increased nicotine intake in mice with a null mutation in Chrn alpha 5. This effect was 'rescued' in knockout mice by re-expressing alpha 5 subunits in the medial habenula (MHb), and recapitulated in rats through alpha 5 subunit knockdown in MHb. Remarkably, alpha 5 subunit knockdown in MHb did not alter the rewarding effects of nicotine but abolished the inhibitory effects of higher nicotine doses on brain reward systems. The MHb extends projections almost exclusively to the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN). We found diminished IPN activation in response to nicotine in alpha 5 knockout mice. Further, disruption of IPN signalling increased nicotine intake in rats. Our findings indicate that nicotine activates the habenulo-interpeduncular pathway through alpha 5-containing nAChRs, triggering an inhibitory motivational signal that acts to limit nicotine intake.","[Fowler, Christie D.; Lu, Qun; Johnson, Paul M.; Kenny, Paul J.] Scripps Res Inst Scripps Florida, Dept Mol Therapeut, Lab Behav & Mol Neurosci, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA; [Marks, Michael J.] Univ Colorado, Inst Behav Genet, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","Kenny, PJ (reprint author), Scripps Res Inst Scripps Florida, Dept Mol Therapeut, Lab Behav & Mol Neurosci, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA.",pjkenny@scripps.edu,"Fowler, Christie/A-1754-2015",,"National Institute on Drug Abuse [DA020686, DA026693, P30DA015663]; Florida Department of Health [07KN-06]","This work was supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (DA020686 to P.J.K.; DA026693 to C.D.F.; P30DA015663 to M.J.M.) and The James and Esther King Biomedical Research Program, Florida Department of Health (07KN-06 to P.J.K.).",,56,266,267,3,28,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,31-Mar,2011,471,7340,,,,,597,601,,10.1038/nature09797,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,742NN,WOS:000288951200034,21278726.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,paul j.,kenny,na,na,na,na,na

Although the maturation of crRNAs represents a key event in CRISPR activation, the responsible endoribonucleases (CasE, Cas6, Csy4) are missing in many CRISPR/Cas subtypes. Here, differential RNA sequencing of the human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes uncovered tracrRNA, a trans-encoded small RNA with 24-nucleotide complementarity to the repeat regions of crRNA precursor transcripts. We show that tracrRNA directs the maturation of crRNAs by the activities of the widely conserved endogenous RNase III and the CRISPR-associated Csn1 protein; all these components are essential to protect S. pyogenes against prophage-derived DNA.

Once a red giant is sufficiently evolved, the helium in the core also undergoes fusion(3). Outstanding issues in our understanding of red giants include uncertainties in the amount of mass lost at the surface before helium ignition and the amount of internal mixing from rotation and other processes(4). Progress is hampered by our inability to distinguish between red giants burning helium in the core and those still only burning hydrogen in a shell. Asteroseismology offers a way forward, being a powerful tool for probing the internal structures of stars using their natural oscillation frequencies(5). Here we report observations of gravity-mode period spacings in red giants(6) that permit a distinction between evolutionary stages to be made. We use high-precision photometry obtained by the Kepler spacecraft over more than a year to measure oscillations in several hundred red giants. We find many stars whose dipole modes show sequences with approximately regular period spacings. These stars fall into two clear groups, allowing us to distinguish unambiguously between hydrogen-shell-burning stars (period spacing mostly similar to 50 seconds) and those that are also burning helium (period spacing similar to 100 to 300 seconds).","[Bedding, Timothy R.; Huber, Daniel; Stello, Dennis; White, Timothy R.] Univ Sydney, Sch Phys, Sydney Inst Astron SIfA, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Mosser, Benoit; Barban, Caroline; Goupil, Marie-Jo] Univ Paris 07, Univ Paris 06, CNRS, LESIA,Observ Paris, F-92195 Meudon, France; [Montalban, Josefina; Miglio, Andrea; Dupret, Marc-Antoine; Noels, Arlette] Univ Liege, Inst Astrophys & Geophys, B-4000 Cointe Ougree, Belgium; [Beck, Paul; De Ridder, Joris; Aerts, Conny; Carrier, Fabien] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Inst Sterrenkunde, B-3001 Louvain, Belgium; [Christensen-Dalsgaard, Jorgen; Frandsen, Soren] Aarhus Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, DASC, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Elsworth, Yvonne P.; Miglio, Andrea; Hekker, Saskia; Broomhall, Anne-Marie; Chaplin, William J.] Univ Birmingham, Sch Phys & Astron, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Garcia, Rafael A.] Univ Paris 07, Ctr Saclay, IRFU SAp, Lab AIM,CEA DSM CNRS, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Hekker, Saskia] Univ Amsterdam, Astron Inst Anton Pannekoek, NL-1098 XH Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Aerts, Conny] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Astrophys, IMAPP, NL-6500 GL Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Belkacem, Kevin] Univ Paris 11, Inst Astrophys Spatiale, UMR 8617, F-91405 Orsay, France; [Brown, Timothy M.] Las Cumbres Observ Global Telescope, Goleta, CA 93117 USA; [Buzasi, Derek L.] Eureka Sci, Oakland, CA 94602 USA; [Di Mauro, Maria Pia] Ist Astrofis Spaziale & Fis Cosm, INAF IASF, I-00133 Rome, Italy; [Gilliland, Ronald L.] Space Telescope Sci Inst, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Jenkins, Jon M.] NASA, Ames Res Ctr, SETI Inst, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; [Kallinger, Thomas] Univ British Columbia, Dept Phys & Astron, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada; [Kawaler, Steven] Iowa State Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Mathur, Savita] NCAR, High Altitude Observ, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Aguirre, Victor Silva] Max Planck Inst Astrophys, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Ventura, Paolo] Osserv Astron Roma, INAF, I-00040 Monte Porzio Catone, RM, Italy","Bedding, TR (reprint author), Univ Sydney, Sch Phys, Sydney Inst Astron SIfA, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",t.bedding@physics.usyd.edu.au,,"Ventura, Paolo/0000-0002-5026-6400; Kallinger, Thomas/0000-0003-3627-2561; Di Mauro, Maria Pia/0000-0001-7801-7484; Bedding, Timothy/0000-0001-5943-1460; Bedding, Tim/0000-0001-5222-4661; Kawaler, Steven/0000-0002-6536-6367; Garcia, Rafael/0000-0002-8854-3776",NASA's Science Mission Directorate; Australian Research Council; European Community; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO); National Science Foundation,"We acknowledge the entire Kepler team, whose efforts made these results possible.

It was first predicted theoretically for a triangular-lattice model with antiferromagnetically coupled S = 1/2 spins(1). Recently, materials have become available showing persuasive experimental evidence for such a state(2). Although many studies show that the ideal triangular lattice of S = 1/2 Heisenberg spins actually orders magnetically into a three-sublattice, non-collinear 1206 arrangement, quantum fluctuations significantly reduce the size of the ordered moment(3). This residual ordering can be completely suppressed when higher-order ring-exchange magnetic interactions are significant, as found in nearly metallic Mott insulators(4). The layered molecular system kappa-(BEDT-TTF)(2)Cu(2)(CN)(3) is a Mott insulator with an almost isotropic, triangular magnetic lattice of spin-1/2 BEDT-TTF dimers(5) that provides a prime example of a spin liquid formed in this way(6-11). Despite a high-temperature exchange coupling, J, of 250 K (ref. 6), no obvious signature of conventional magnetic ordering is seen down to 20 mK (refs 7, 8). Here we show, using muon spin rotation, that applying a small magnetic field to this system produces a quantum phase transition between the spin-liquid phase and an antiferromagnetic phase with a strongly suppressed moment. This can be described as Bose-Einstein condensation of spin excitations with an extremely small spin gap. At higher fields, a second transition is found that suggests a threshold for deconfinement of the spin excitations. Our studies reveal the low-temperature magnetic phase diagram and enable us to measure characteristic critical properties. We compare our results closely with current theoretical models, and this gives some further insight into the nature of the spin-liquid phase.","[Pratt, F. L.; Baker, P.

In the quantum mechanical picture of inelastic light scattering, incident photons first excite a set of intermediate electronic states, which then generate crystal elementary excitations and radiate energy-shifted photons(6). The intermediate electronic excitations therefore have a crucial role as quantum pathways in inelastic light scattering, and this is exemplified by resonant Raman scattering(6) and Raman interference(7,8). The ability to control these excitation pathways can open up new opportunities to probe, manipulate and utilize inelastic light scattering. Here we achieve excitation pathway control in graphene with electrostatic doping. Our study reveals quantum interference between different Raman pathways in graphene: when some of the pathways are blocked, the one-phonon Raman intensity does not diminish, as commonly expected, but increases dramatically. This discovery sheds new light on the understanding of resonance Raman scattering in graphene. In addition, we demonstrate hot-electron luminescence9 in graphene as the Fermi energy approaches half the laser excitation energy. This hot luminescence, which is another form of inelastic light scattering, results from excited-state relaxation channels that become available only in heavily doped graphene.","[Chen, Chi-Fan; Park, Cheol-Hwan; Horng, Jason; Geng, Baisong; Girit, Caglar; Zettl, Alex; Crommie, Michael F.; Louie, Steven G.; Wang, Feng] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Boudouris, Bryan W.; Segalman, Rachel A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Boudouris, Bryan W.; Zettl, Alex; Crommie, Michael F.; Segalman, Rachel A.; Louie, Steven G.; Wang, Feng] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Wang, F (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",fengwang76@berkeley.edu,"Park, Cheol-Hwan/A-1543-2009; Girit, Caglar/D-4845-2014; Zettl, Alex/O-4925-2016; wang, Feng/I-5727-2015","Park, Cheol-Hwan/0000-0003-1584-6896; Girit, Caglar/0000-0001-8953-9261; Zettl, Alex/0000-0001-6330-136X; Segalman, Rachel/0000-0002-4292-5103","US Department of Energy, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-AC02-05CH11231, DE-AC03-76SF0098]; ONR MURI [N00014-09-1-1066]; National Science Council; National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan [NSC98-2811-M-007-008, NSC98-2120-M-007-004]","This work was supported by the US Department of Energy, Laboratory Directed Research and Development Program of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory under contract no.

This has been attributed to the effects of stationary weather systems set by elevated terrain (orography)(1), and to a lack of maritime influences from the prevailing westerly winds(2). However, the differences in extent and orography between the two continents suggest that further mechanisms are involved. Here we show that this anomalous winter cold can result in part from westward radiation of large-scale atmospheric waves-nearly stationary Rossby waves-generated by heating of the atmosphere over warm ocean waters. We demonstrate this mechanism using simulations with an idealized general circulation model(3-5), with which we show that the extent of the cold region is controlled by properties of Rossby waves, such as their group velocity and its dependence on the planetary rotation rate. Our results show that warm ocean waters contribute to the contrast in mid-latitude winter temperatures between eastern and western continental boundaries not only by warming western boundaries, but also by cooling eastern boundaries.","[Kaspi, Yohai; Schneider, Tapio] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Kaspi, Y (reprint author), CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",yohai@alum.mit.edu,"Schneider, Tapio /A-7038-2014; Kim, Baek-Min/A-4634-2015","Schneider, Tapio /0000-0001-5687-2287; ",National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate and Global Change; David and Lucile Packard Fellowship; National Science Foundation [AGS-1019211],"We thank D.

The eudicots form the majority of the angiosperms in the world today. The flowering plants are of exceptional evolutionary interest because of their diversity of over 250,000 species and their abundance as the dominant vegetation in most terrestrial ecosystems, but little is known of their very early history. In this report we document an early presence of eudicots during the Early Cretaceous Period. Diagnostic characters of the eudicot fossil Leefructus gen. nov. include simple and deeply trilobate leaves clustered at the nodes in threes or fours, basal palinactinodromous primary venation, pinnate secondary venation, and a long axillary reproductive axis terminating in a flattened receptacle bearing five long, narrow pseudo-syncarpous carpels. These morphological characters suggest that its affinities are with the Ranunculaceae, a basal eudicot family. The fossil co-occurs with Archaefructus sinensis(3) and Hyrcantha decussata(4) whereas Archaefructus liaoningensis(5) comes from more ancient sediments. Multiple radiometric dates of the Lower Cretaceous Yixian Formation place the bed yielding this fossil at 122.6-125.8 million years old(6-8). The earliest fossil records of eudicots are 127 to 125 million years old, on the basis of pollen(9,10). Thus, Leefructus gen. nov. suggests that the basal eudicots were already present and diverse by the latest Barremian and earliest Aptian.","[Sun, Ge; Dilcher, David L.; Wang, Hongshan] Shenyang Normal Univ, Inst Paleontol, Shenyang 110034, Peoples R China; [Sun, Ge; Dilcher, David L.] Jilin Univ, Res Ctr Paleontol, Changchun 130026, Peoples R China; [Dilcher, David L.] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Wang, Hongshan] Univ Florida, Florida Museum Nat Hist, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Chen, Zhiduan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Systemat & Evolutionary Bot, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China","Sun, G (reprint author), Shenyang Normal Univ, Inst Paleontol, Shenyang 110034, Peoples R China.",sunge@synu.edu.cn; dilcher@indiana.edu,,,"Key Lab of Evolution of Past Life and Environment in Northeast Asia, Ministry of Education, China; Project ""111'' of China; NSFC [40842002]","We acknowledge the support of the Key Lab of Evolution of Past Life and Environment in Northeast Asia, Ministry of Education, China, and Project ""111'' of China, NSFC project number 40842002, and the President Special Fund of Shenyang Normal University to carry out this research project during 2008-2009.

Professional APCs specialized for T-cell activation acquire viral antigen either by becoming infected themselves (direct presentation) or by phagocytosis of infected cells, followed by transfer of antigen to the cytosol, processing and MHC class I loading in a process referred to as cross-presentation(2). An alternative way, referred to as 'cross-dressing', by which an uninfected APC could present antigen was postulated to be by the transfer of preformed peptide-MHC complexes from the surface of an infected cell to the APC without the need of further processing(3). Here we show that this mechanism exists and boosts the antiviral response of mouse memory CD8(+) T cells. A number of publications have demonstrated sharing of peptide-loaded MHC molecules in vitro(4-7). Our in vitro experiments demonstrate that cross-dressing APCs do not acquire peptide-MHC complexes in the form of exosomes released by donor cells. Rather, the APCs and donor cells have to contact each other for the transfer to occur. After a viral infection, we could isolate cross-dressed APCs able to present viral antigen in vitro. Furthermore, using the diphtheria toxin system to selectively eliminate APCs that could only acquire viral peptide-MHC complexes by cross-dressing, we show that such presentation can promote the expansion of resting memory T cells. Notably, naive T cells were excluded from taking part in the response. Cross-dressing is a mechanism of antigen presentation used by dendritic cells that may have a significant role in activating previously primed CD8(+) T cells.","[Wakim, Linda M.; Bevan, Michael J.] Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Immunol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Bevan, MJ (reprint author), Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Immunol, Box 357370, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",mbevan@u.washington.edu,,"Wakim, Linda/0000-0003-1752-9579",Howard Hughes Medical Institute; National Institutes of Health; National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia,This work was supported by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and National Institutes of Health.

Spontaneous null mutations in the Sharpin (SHANK-associated RH domain interacting protein in postsynaptic density)(7) gene are responsible for the cpdm phenotype in mice(8). SHARPIN shows significant similarity to HOIL-1L (also known as RBCK1)(8,9), a component of linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), which induces NF-kappa B activation through conjugation of linear polyubiquitin chains to NEMO(10-13). Here, we identify SHARPIN as an additional component of LUBAC. SHARPIN-containing complexes can linearly ubiquitinate NEMO and activated NF-kappa B. Thus, we re-define LUBAC as a complex containing SHARPIN, HOIL-1L, and HOIP (also known as RNF31). Deletion of SHARPIN drastically reduced the amount of LUBAC, which resulted in attenuated TNF-alpha- and CD40-mediated activation of NF-kappa B in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) or B cells from cpdm mice. Considering the pleomorphic phenotype of cpdm mice, these results confirm the predicted role of LUBAC-mediated linear polyubiquitination in NF-kappa B activation induced by various stimuli, and strongly suggest the involvement of LUBAC-induced NF-kappa B activation in various disorders.","[Tokunaga, Fuminori; Nakagawa, Tomoko; Nakahara, Masaki; Taniguchi, Masami; Sakata, Shin-ichi; Iwai, Kazuhiro] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Biophys & Biochem, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Saeki, Yasushi; Tanaka, Keiji] Tokyo Metropolitan Inst Med Sci, Lab Prot Metab, Setagaya Ku, Tokyo 1568506, Japan; [Nakano, Hiroyasu] Juntendo Univ, Sch Med, Dept Immunol, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138421, Japan; [Iwai, Kazuhiro] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Frontier Biosci, Cell Biol & Metab Grp, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan","Iwai, K (reprint author), Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Biophys & Biochem, 2-2 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan.",kiwai@cellbio.med.osaka-u.ac.jp,,"Nakano, Hiroyasu/0000-0003-4843-1427","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan","We thank T.

Coexpression of SHARPIN and HOIP promotes linear ubiquitination of NEMO (also known as IKBKG), an adaptor of the I kappa B kinases (IKKs) and subsequent activation of NF-kappa B signalling, whereas SHARPIN deficiency in mice causes an impaired activation of the IKK complex and NF-kappa B in B cells, macrophages and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). This effect is further enhanced upon concurrent downregulation of HOIL-1L (also known as RBCK1), another HOIP-binding component of LUBAC. In addition, SHARPIN deficiency leads to rapid cell death upon tumour-necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) stimulation via FADD- and caspase-8-dependent pathways. SHARPIN thus activates NF kappa B and inhibits apoptosis via distinct pathways in vivo.","[Ikeda, Fumiyo; Deribe, Yonathan Lissanu; Skanland, Sigrid S.; Grabbe, Caroline; van Wijk, Sjoerd J.

A variety of processes act upon Holliday junctions to remove them from DNA, in events that are critical for proper chromosome segregation. In human cells, the BLM protein, inactivated in individuals with Bloom's syndrome, acts in combination with topoisomerase III alpha, RMI1 and RMI2 (BTR complex) to promote the dissolution of double Holliday junctions(1,2). Cells defective for BLM exhibit elevated levels of sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) and patients with Bloom's syndrome develop a broad spectrum of early-onset cancers caused by chromosome instability(3). MUS81-EME1 (refs 4-7), SLX1-SLX4 (refs 8-11) and GEN1 (refs 12, 13) also process Holliday junctions but, in contrast to the BTR complex, do so by endonucleolytic cleavage. Here we deplete these nucleases from Bloom's syndrome cells to analyse human cells compromised for the known Holliday junction dissolution/resolution pathways. We show that depletion of MUS81 and GEN1, or SLX4 and GEN1, from Bloom's syndrome cells results in severe chromosome abnormalities, such that sister chromatids remain interlinked in a side-by-side arrangement and the chromosomes are elongated and segmented. Our results indicate that normally replicating human cells require Holliday junction processing activities to prevent sister chromatid entanglements and thereby ensure accurate chromosome condensation. This phenotype was not apparent when both MUS81 and SLX4 were depleted from Bloom's syndrome cells, suggesting that GEN1 can compensate for their absence. Additionally, we show that depletion of MUS81 or SLX4 reduces the high frequency of SCEs in Bloom's syndrome cells, indicating that MUS81 and SLX4 promote SCE formation, in events that may ultimately drive the chromosome instabilities that underpin early-onset cancers associated with Bloom's syndrome.","[Wechsler, Thomas; West, Stephen C.] Imperial Canc Res Fund, Clare Hall Labs, Canc Res UK, London Res Inst, S Mimms EN6 3LD, Herts, England; [Newman, Scott] Univ Cambridge, Dept Pathol, Cambridge CB2 1QP, England","West, SC (reprint author), Imperial Canc Res Fund, Clare Hall Labs, Canc Res UK, London Res Inst, S Mimms EN6 3LD, Herts, England.",stephen.west@cancer.org.uk,"Newman, Scott/B-4843-2012","West, Stephen/0000-0001-8848-9418",Cancer Research UK; Louis-Jeantet Foundation; European Research Council; Swiss Bridge Foundation; Breast Cancer Campaign; UK Medical Research Council,"We thank I.

Pyrrolysine comprises a methylated pyrroline carboxylate in amide linkage to the e-amino group of L-lysine(2,7,8). In certain Archaea, three methyltransferases initiate methanogenesis from the various methylamines(9-11), and these enzymes are encoded by genes with an in-frame amber codon(12,13) that is translated as pyrrolysine(2,7,8). Escherichia coli that has been transformed with the pylTSBCD genes from methanogenic Archaea can incorporate endogenously biosynthesized pyrrolysine into proteins(14). The decoding of UAG as pyrrolysine requires pylT(1,6), which produces tRNA(Pyl) (also called tRNA(CUA)), and pylS(1), which encodes a pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase(4,15,16). The pylB, pylC and pylD genes(1) are each required for tRNA-independent pyrrolysine synthesis(14). Pyrrolysine is the last remaining genetically encoded amino acid with an unknown biosynthetic pathway. Here we provide genetic and mass spectrometric evidence for a pylBCD-dependent pathway in which pyrrolysine arises from two lysines. We show that a newly uncovered UAG-encoded amino acid, desmethylpyrrolysine, is made from lysine and exogenous D-ornithine in a pylC-dependent process followed by a pylD-dependent process, but it is not further converted to pyrrolysine. These results indicate that the radical S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) protein PylB mediates a lysine mutase reaction that produces 3-methylornithine, which is then ligated to a second molecule of lysine by PylC before oxidation by PylD results in pyrrolysine. The discovery of lysine as the sole precursor to pyrrolysine will further inform discussions of the evolution of the genetic code and amino acid biosynthetic pathways. Furthermore, intermediates of the pathway may provide new avenues by which the pyl system can be exploited to produce recombinant proteins with useful modified residues.","[Gaston, Marsha A.; Krzycki, Joseph A.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Microbiol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Zhang, Liwen; Green-Church, Kari B.] Ohio State Univ, Mass Spectrometry & Prote Facil, CCIC, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Krzycki, Joseph A.] Ohio State Univ, Biochem Program, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Krzycki, JA (reprint author), Ohio State Univ, Dept Microbiol, 484 W 12th Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",krzycki.1@osu.edu,"Green, Kari/H-3541-2011; Zhang, Liwen/P-1111-2016",,National Institutes of Health; US Department of Energy,This work was supported by a grant from the National Institutes of Health to K.B.G.-C. and by grants from the US Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health to J.A.K.

The photoreceptor rhodopsin couples to transducin and bears its ligand 11-cis-retinal covalently bound via a protonated Schiff base to the opsin apoprotein(2). Absorption of a photon causes retinal cis/trans isomerization and generates the agonist all-trans-retinal in situ. After early photoproducts, the active G-protein-binding intermediate metarhodopsin II (Meta II) is formed, in which the retinal Schiff base is still intact but deprotonated. Dissociation of the proton from the Schiff base breaks a major constraint in the protein and enables further activating steps, including an outward tilt of TM6 and formation of a large cytoplasmic crevice for uptake of the interacting C terminus of the G alpha subunit(3-5). Owing to Schiff base hydrolysis, Meta II is short-lived and notoriously difficult to crystallize. We therefore soaked opsin crystals with all-trans-retinal to form Meta II, presuming that the crystal's high concentration of opsin in an active conformation (Ops*)(6,7) may facilitate all-trans-retinal uptake and Schiff base formation. Here we present the 3.0 angstrom and 2.85 angstrom crystal structures, respectively, of Meta II alone or in complex with an 11-amino-acid C-terminal fragment derived from G alpha (G alpha CT2). G alpha CT2 binds in a large crevice at the cytoplasmic side, akin to the binding of a similar G alpha-derived peptide to Ops* (ref. 7). In the Meta II structures, the electron density from the retinal ligand seamlessly continues into the Lys 296 side chain, reflecting proper formation of the Schiff base linkage. The retinal is in a relaxed conformation and almost undistorted compared with pure crystalline all-trans-retinal. By comparison with early photoproducts we propose how retinal translocation and rotation induce the gross conformational changes characteristic for Meta II. The structures can now serve as models for the large GPCR family.","[Choe, Hui-Woog; Kim, Yong Ju; Park, Jung Hee; Morizumi, Takefumi; Hofmann, Klaus Peter; Scheerer, Patrick; Ernst, Oliver P.] Charite, Inst Med Phys & Biophys CC2, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Choe, Hui-Woog] Chonbuk Natl Univ, Coll Nat Sci, Dept Chem, Chonju 561756, South Korea; [Pai, Emil F.] Univ Toronto, Dept Biochem, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [Pai, Emil F.] Univ Toronto, Dept Mol Genet, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [Pai, Emil F.] Univ Toronto, Dept Med Biophys, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [Krauss, Norbert] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, London E1 4NS, England; [Hofmann, Klaus Peter] Humboldt Univ, Zentrum Biophys & Bioinformat, D-10115 Berlin, Germany","Choe, HW (reprint author), Charite, Inst Med Phys & Biophys CC2, Charite Pl 1, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",hwchoe@jbnu.ac.kr; klaus_peter.hofmann@charite.de; oliver.ernst@utoronto.ca,"Pai, Emil/D-2526-2013","Pai, Emil/0000-0002-1162-7242","DFG [Sfb449, Sfb740]; ERC; Canada Research Chairs Program; Ministry of Education, Science and Technology [2010-0002738]; CBNU; Leibniz Graduate School of Molecular Biophysics, Berlin","We thank J.

Integrative analysis with other data (non-histone chromatin proteins, DNase I hypersensitivity, GRO-Seq reads produced by engaged polymerase, short/long RNA products) reveals discrete characteristics of chromosomes, genes, regulatory elements and other functional domains. We find that active genes display distinct chromatin signatures that are correlated with disparate gene lengths, exon patterns, regulatory functions and genomic contexts. We also demonstrate a diversity of signatures among Polycomb targets that include a subset with paused polymerase. This systematic profiling and integrative analysis of chromatin signatures provides insights into how genomic elements are regulated, and will serve as a resource for future experimental investigations of genome structure and function.","[Kharchenko, Peter V.; Tolstorukov, Michael Y.; Luquette, Lovelace J.; Xi, Ruibin; Jung, Youngsook L.; Park, Richard W.; Bishop, Eric P.; Park, Peter J.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Biomed Informat, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Kharchenko, Peter V.; Tolstorukov, Michael Y.; Park, Peter J.] Childrens Hosp, Informat Program, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Alekseyenko, Artyom A.; Larschan, Erica; Gorchakov, Andrey A.; Plachetka, Annette; Jung, Youngsook L.; Kuroda, Mitzi I.; Park, Peter J.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Div Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Alekseyenko, Artyom A.; Larschan, Erica; Gorchakov, Andrey A.; Plachetka, Annette; Kuroda, Mitzi I.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Schwartz, Yuri B.; Linder-Basso, Daniela; Shanower, Gregory; Pirrotta, Vincenzo] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Biochem, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; [Minoda, Aki; Karpen, Gary H.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Minoda, Aki; Karpen, Gary H.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Dept Genome Dynam, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Riddle, Nicole C.; Gu, Tingting; Elgin, Sarah C.

Catalytic procedures for the stereoselective formation of alkenes are valuable, yet methods enabling the synthesis of 1,2-disubstituted Z alkenes are scarce. Here we report catalytic Z-selective cross-metathesis reactions of terminal enol ethers, which have not been reported previously, and of allylic amides, used until now only in E-selective processes. The corresponding disubstituted alkenes are formed in up to >98% Z selectivity and 97% yield. These transformations, promoted by catalysts that contain the highly abundant and inexpensive metal molybdenum, are amenable to gram-scale operations. Use of reduced pressure is introduced as a simple and effective strategy for achieving high stereoselectivity. The utility of this method is demonstrated by its use in syntheses of an anti-oxidant plasmalogen phospholipid, found in electrically active tissues and implicated in Alzheimer's disease, and the potent immunostimulant KRN7000.","[Meek, Simon J.; O'Brien, Robert V.; Llaveria, Josep; Hoveyda, Amir H.] Boston Coll, Merkert Chem Ctr, Dept Chem, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA; [Schrock, Richard R.] MIT, Dept Chem, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Hoveyda, AH (reprint author), Boston Coll, Merkert Chem Ctr, Dept Chem, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA.",amir.hoveyda@bc.edu,,"Llaveria Cros, Josep/0000-0003-2260-3657","US National Institutes of Health, Institute of General Medical Sciences [GM-59426]; National Science Foundation [CHE-0715138]; US National Science Foundation [DBI-0619576]","This research was supported by the US National Institutes of Health, Institute of General Medical Sciences (GM-59426 to A.H.H. and R.R.S.) and the National Science Foundation (CHE-0715138 to A.H.H.).

In addition, a broader than anticipated role of NF-kappa B signalling was indicated by mutations in 11 members of the NF-kappa B pathway.

W.",,,Interaction-based quantum metrology showing scaling beyond the Heisenberg limit,NATURE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Quantum metrology aims to use entanglement and other quantum resources to improve precision measurement(1). An interferometer using N independent particles to measure a parameter X can achieve at best the standard quantum limit of sensitivity, delta X proportional to N-1/2. However, using N entangled particles and exotic states(2), such an interferometer(3) can in principle achieve the Heisenberg limit, delta X proportional to N-1. Recent theoretical work(4-6) has argued that interactions among particles may be a valuable resource for quantum metrology, allowing scaling beyond the Heisenberg limit. Specifically, a k-particle interaction will produce sensitivity delta X proportional to N-k with appropriate entangled states and delta X proportional to N-(k-1/2) even without entanglement(7). Here we demonstrate 'super-Heisenberg' scaling of delta X proportional to N-3/2 in a nonlinear, non-destructive(8,9) measurement of the magnetization(10,11) of an atomic ensemble(12). We use fast optical nonlinearities to generate a pairwise photon-photon interaction(13) (corresponding to k = 2) while preserving quantum-noise-limited performance(7,14). We observe super-Heisenberg scaling over two orders of magnitude in N, limited at large numbers by higher order nonlinear effects, in good agreement with theory(13). For a measurement of limited duration, super-Heisenberg scaling allows the nonlinear measurement to overtake in sensitivity a comparable linear measurement with the same number of photons. In other situations, however, higher-order nonlinearities prevent this crossover from occurring, reflecting the subtle relationship between scaling and sensitivity in nonlinear systems. Our work shows that interparticle interactions can improve sensitivity in a quantum-limited measurement, and experimentally demonstrates a new resource for quantum metrology.","[Napolitano, M.; Koschorreck, M.; Dubost, B.; Behbood, N.; Sewell, R.

This technique is particularly useful in the study(4,5) and in the control(6) of materials whose physical properties are governed by the interactions between multiple degrees of freedom. Time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy is in this context a direct and comprehensive, energy- and momentum-selective probe of the ultrafast processes that couple to the electronic degrees of freedom(7-10). Previously, the capability of such studies to access electron momentum space away from zero momentum was, however, restricted owing to limitations of the available probing photon energy(10,11). Here, using femtosecond extreme-ultraviolet pulses delivered by a high-harmonic-generation source, we use time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to measure the photoinduced vaporization of a charge-ordered state in the potential excitonic insulator 1T-TiSe(2) (refs 12, 13). By way of stroboscopic imaging of electronic band dispersions at large momentum, in the vicinity of the edge of the first Brillouin zone, we reveal that the collapse of atomic-scale periodic long-range order happens on a timescale as short as 20 femtoseconds. The surprisingly fast response of the system is assigned to screening by the transient generation of free charge carriers. Similar screening scenarios are likely to be relevant in other photoinduced solid-state transitions and may generally determine the response times. Moreover, as electron states with large momenta govern fundamental electronic properties in condensed matter systems(14), we anticipate that the experimental advance represented by the present study will be useful to study the ultrafast dynamics and microscopic mechanisms of electronic phenomena in a wide range of materials.","[Rohwer, Timm; Hellmann, Stefan; Wiesenmayer, Martin; Sohrt, Christian; Stange, Ankatrin; Slomski, Bartosz; Kallaene, Matthias; Kipp, Lutz; Rossnagel, Kai; Bauer, Michael] Univ Kiel, Inst Expt & Appl Phys, D-24118 Kiel, Germany; [Carr, Adra; Mathias, Stefan] Univ Colorado, JILA, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Carr, Adra; Mathias, Stefan] NIST, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Liu, Yanwei] Univ Calif Berkeley, NSF ERC Extreme Ultraviolet Sci & Technol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Liu, Yanwei] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Ctr Xray Opt, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Miaja-Avila, Luis] Univ Texas Austin, Ctr Nano & Mol Sci, Austin, TX 78722 USA; [Mathias, Stefan] Univ Kaiserslautern, Dept Phys, D-67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany; [Mathias, Stefan] Univ Kaiserslautern, Res Ctr OPTIMAS, D-67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany","Bauer, M (reprint author), Univ Kiel, Inst Expt & Appl Phys, Olshaussenstr 40, D-24118 Kiel, Germany.",rossnagel@physik.uni-kiel.de; bauer@physik.uni-kiel.de,"Rossnagel, Kai/F-8822-2011; Mathias, Stefan/I-4679-2012; Bauer, Michael/G-5111-2016","Rossnagel, Kai/0000-0001-5107-0090; Mathias, Stefan/0000-0002-1255-521X; Bauer, Michael/0000-0002-4391-9899","JILA Physics Frontier Center; German Science Foundation (DFG) [SFB 855]; European Community [GA 253316]; US Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences; NSF EUV ERC","M.B. and S.M. thank M.

Given the difficulty in determining friction by seismological methods(1), elucidating constraints are derived from experimental studies(2-9). Here we review a large set of published and unpublished experiments (similar to 300) performed in rotary shear apparatus at slip rates of 0.1-2.6 ms(-1). The experiments indicate a significant decrease in friction (of up to one order of magnitude), which we term fault lubrication, both for cohesive (silicate-built(4-6), quartz-built(3) and carbonate-built(7,8)) rocks and non-cohesive rocks (clay-rich(9), anhydrite, gypsum and dolomite(10) gouges) typical of crustal seismogenic sources. The available mechanical work and the associated temperature rise in the slipping zone trigger(11,12) a number of physicochemical processes (gelification, decarbonation and dehydration reactions, melting and so on) whose products are responsible for fault lubrication. The similarity between (1) experimental and natural fault products and (2) mechanical work measures resulting from these laboratory experiments and seismological estimates(13,14) suggests that it is reasonable to extrapolate experimental data to conditions typical of earthquake nucleation depths (7-15 km).

Substantial risk for schizophrenia is conferred by large (>500-kilobase) CNVs at several loci, including microdeletions at 1q21.1 (ref. 2), 3q29 (ref. 3), 15q13.3 (ref. 2) and 22q11.2 (ref. 4) and microduplication at 16p11.2 (ref. 5). However, these CNVs collectively account for a small fraction (2-4%) of cases, and the relevant genes and neurobiological mechanisms are not well understood. Here we performed a large two-stage genome-wide scan of rare CNVs and report the significant association of copy number gains at chromosome 7q36.3 with schizophrenia. Microduplications with variable breakpoints occurred within a 362-kilobase region and were detected in 29 of 8,290 (0.35%) patients versus 2 of 7,431 (0.03%) controls in the combined sample. All duplications overlapped or were located within 89 kilobases upstream of the vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor gene VIPR2. VIPR2 transcription and cyclic-AMP signalling were significantly increased in cultured lymphocytes from patients with microduplications of 7q36.3. These findings implicate altered vasoactive intestinal peptide signalling in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and indicate the VPAC2 receptor as a potential target for the development of new antipsychotic drugs.","[Vacic, Vladimir; McCarthy, Shane; Malhotra, Dheeraj; Bhandari, Abhishek; Sebat, Jonathan] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Stanley Inst Cognit Genom, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 12824 USA; [Vacic, Vladimir] Columbia Univ, Dept Comp Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Malhotra, Dheeraj; Chou, Hsun-Hua; Bhandari, Abhishek; Sebat, Jonathan] Univ Calif San Diego, Beyster Ctr Genom Psychiat Dis, La Jolla, CA USA; [Malhotra, Dheeraj; Chou, Hsun-Hua; Bhandari, Abhishek; Corominas, Roser; Iakoucheva, Lilia M.; Welsh, David K.; Kelsoe, John R.; Sebat, Jonathan] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Psychiat, La Jolla, CA USA; [Murray, Fiona; Aquila, Marie Dell; Insel, Paul A.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Med, La Jolla, CA USA; [Murray, Fiona; Insel, Paul A.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Pharmacol, La Jolla, CA USA; [Peoples, Aine; Morris, Derek W.; Gill, Michael; Corvin, Aiden] Trinity Coll Dublin, Inst Mol Med, Neuropsychiat Genet Res Grp, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Peoples, Aine; Morris, Derek W.; Gill, Michael; Corvin, Aiden] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Psychiat, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Makarov, Vladimir; Yoon, Seungtai] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Seaver Autism Ctr, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Makarov, Vladimir; Yoon, Seungtai] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Krastoshevsky, Olga; Krause, Verena; Levy, Deborah L.] McLean Hosp, Belmont, MA 02478 USA; [Larach-Walters, Veronica] Univ Andres Bello, Fac Med, Santiago, Chile; [Welsh, David K.; Kelsoe, John R.] Vet Affairs San Diego Healthcare Syst, San Diego, CA 92161 USA; [Welsh, David K.] Univ Calif San Diego, Ctr Chronobiol, La Jolla, CA USA; [Craig, David] Translat Genom Res Inst, Neurogenom Div, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA; [Kelsoe, John R.; Sebat, Jonathan] Univ Calif San Diego, Inst Genom Med, La Jolla, CA USA; [Gershon, Elliot S.] Univ Chicago, Dept Psychiat & Behav Neurosci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Leal, Suzanne M.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Human Genet, Houston, TX 77025 USA; [Aquila, Marie Dell] Univ Calif San Diego, Div Med Genet, La Jolla, CA USA; [McClellan, Jon] Univ Washington, Dept Psychiat, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [King, Mary-Claire] Univ Washington, Dept Genome Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [King, Mary-Claire] Univ Washington, Dept Med, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Karayiorgou, Maria] Columbia Univ, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10027 USA; [DeLisi, Lynn E.] Boston VA Healthcare Syst, Dept Psychiat, Brockton, MA 02301 USA; [DeLisi, Lynn E.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Brockton, MA 02301 USA; [Sebat, Jonathan] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Cellular & Mol Med, La Jolla, CA USA","Sebat, J (reprint author), Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Stanley Inst Cognit Genom, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 12824 USA.",jsebat@ucsd.edu,"Welsh, David/G-2277-2011; Corominas, Roser/H-4163-2016","Corominas, Roser/0000-0001-8888-5402; Sebat, Jonathan/0000-0002-9087-526X; Corvin, Aiden/0000-0001-6717-4089; Iakoucheva, Lilia/0000-0002-4542-5219; Gill, Michael/0000-0003-0206-5337; Morris, Derek/0000-0002-3413-570X; Vacic, Vladimir/0000-0001-6571-2293","Beyster family foundation; NIH [MH076431, HG04222, MH071523, MH083989, GM66232, HL091061, MH082945, MH061399, MH044245]; NARSAD; Wellcome Trust [072894/Z/03/Z]; Science Foundation Ireland [08INIB1916]; Sidney R.

Here we show that neonatal mouse testes which contain only gonocytes or primitive spermatogonia as germ cells can produce spermatids and sperm in vitro with serum-free culture media. Spermatogenesis was maintained over 2 months in tissue fragments positioned at the gas-liquid interphase. The obtained spermatids and sperm resulted in healthy and reproductively competent offspring through microinsemination. In addition, neonatal testis tissues were cryopreserved and, after thawing, showed complete spermatogenesis in vitro. Our organ culture method could be applicable through further refinements to a variety of mammalian species, which will serve as a platform for future clinical application as well as mechanistic understanding of spermatogenesis.","[Sato, Takuya; Katagiri, Kumiko; Gohbara, Ayako; Kubota, Yoshinobu; Ogawa, Takehiko] Yokohama City Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Urol, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360004, Japan; [Inoue, Kimiko; Ogonuki, Narumi; Ogura, Atsuo] RIKEN, Bioresource Ctr, Ibaraki 3050074, Japan; [Ogawa, Takehiko] Yokohama City Univ, Adv Med Res Ctr, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360004, Japan","Ogawa, T (reprint author), Yokohama City Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Urol, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360004, Japan.",ogawa@med.yokohama-cu.ac.jp,"Ogura, Atsuo/J-3916-2014; Sato, Takuya/F-8251-2017","Ogura, Atsuo/0000-0003-0447-1988; Sato, Takuya/0000-0002-6198-2234","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology, Japan [20116005, 21592080]; Yokohama Foundation for Advancement of Medical Science; Yokohama City University, Japan [S2116]","We thank S.

The signals triggering entry into and exit from this reversible dormant state are not well understood. In the developing Drosophila central nervous system, multipotent self-renewing progenitors called neuroblasts(6-9) undergo quiescence in a stereotypical spatiotemporal pattern(10). Entry into quiescence is regulated by Hox proteins and an internal neuroblast timer(11-13). Exit from quiescence (reactivation) is subject to a nutritional checkpoint requiring dietary amino acids(14). Organ co-cultures also implicate an unidentified signal from an adipose/hepatic-like tissue called the fat body(14). Here we provide in vivo evidence that Slimfast amino-acid sensing and Target of rapamycin (TOR) signalling(15) activate a fat-body-derived signal (FDS) required for neuroblast reactivation. Downstream of this signal, Insulin-like receptor signalling and the Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/TOR network are required in neuroblasts for exit from quiescence. We demonstrate that nutritionally regulated glial cells provide the source of Insulin-like peptides (ILPs) relevant for timely neuroblast reactivation but not for overall larval growth. Conversely, ILPs secreted into the haemolymph by median neurosecretory cells systemically control organismal size(16-18) but do not reactivate neuroblasts. Drosophila thus contains two segregated ILP pools, one regulating proliferation within the central nervous system and the other controlling tissue growth systemically. Our findings support a model in which amino acids trigger the cell cycle re-entry of neural progenitors via a fat-body-glia-neuroblasts relay. This mechanism indicates that dietary nutrients and remote organs, as well as local niches, are key regulators of transitions in stem-cell behaviour.","[Sousa-Nunes, Rita; Yee, Lih Ling; Gould, Alex P.] Natl Inst Med Res, MRC, Div Dev Neurobiol, London NW7 1AA, England","Gould, AP (reprint author), Natl Inst Med Res, MRC, Div Dev Neurobiol, London NW7 1AA, England.",agould@nimr.mrc.ac.uk,"Gould, Alex/A-7479-2010","Gould, Alex/0000-0002-6875-6985",Medical Research Council [U117584237],"We are grateful to A.

BRAF(V600E) mutations are also present in benign melanocytic naevi(3), highlighting the importance of additional genetic alterations in the genesis of malignant tumours. Such changes include recurrent copy number variations that result in the amplification of oncogenes(4,5). For certain amplifications, the large number of genes in the interval has precluded an understanding of the cooperating oncogenic events. Here we have used a zebrafish melanoma model to test genes in a recurrently amplified region of chromosome 1 for the ability to cooperate with BRAF(V600E) and accelerate melanoma. SETDB1, an enzyme that methylates histone H3 on lysine 9 (H3K9), was found to accelerate melanoma formation significantly in zebrafish. Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with massively parallel DNA sequencing and gene expression analyses uncovered genes, including HOX genes, that are transcriptionally dysregulated in response to increased levels of SETDB1. Our studies establish SETDB1 as an oncogene in melanoma and underscore the role of chromatin factors in regulating tumorigenesis.","[Ceol, Craig J.; Houvras, Yariv; Bourque, Caitlin; Burke, Christopher J.; Turner, Laura; Uong, Audrey; Zon, Leonard I.] Harvard Univ, Stem Cell Program & Hematol Oncol, Childrens Hosp Boston,Med Sch, Howard Hughes Med Inst,Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Houvras, Yariv] Harvard Univ, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Canc, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Jane-Valbuena, Judit; Lin, William M.; Johnson, Laura A.; Beroukhim, Rameen; Mermel, Craig H.; Garraway, Levi A.] Harvard Univ, Dept Med Oncol, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Jane-Valbuena, Judit; Lin, William M.; Johnson, Laura A.; Beroukhim, Rameen; Mermel, Craig H.; Garraway, Levi A.] Harvard Univ, Ctr Canc Genome Discovery, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Jane-Valbuena, Judit; Lin, William M.; Johnson, Laura A.; Beroukhim, Rameen; Mermel, Craig H.; Garraway, Levi A.] Broad Inst Harvard & Massachusetts Inst Technol, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Bilodeau, Steve; Orlando, David A.; Young, Richard A.] Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Battisti, Valentine; Fritsch, Lauriane; Ait-Si-Ali, Slimane] Univ Paris Diderot, Epigenet & Destin Cellulaire UMR7216, CNRS, F-75013 Paris, France; [Hollmann, Travis J.; Loda, Massimo] Harvard Univ, Ctr Mol Oncol Pathol, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dana Farber Canc Inst,Med Sch, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Ferre, Fabrizio] Univ Roma La Sapienza, A Rossi Fanelli Biochem Sci Dept, I-00185 Rome, Italy","Zon, LI (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Stem Cell Program & Hematol Oncol, Childrens Hosp Boston,Med Sch, Howard Hughes Med Inst,Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",zon@enders.tch.harvard.edu,"; Young, Richard/F-6495-2012","FERRE', FABRIZIO/0000-0003-2768-5305; Bilodeau, Steve/0000-0002-9799-3832; Young, Richard/0000-0001-8855-8647","Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation [DRG-1855-05]; Charles A.

It is unknown to what extent the programs that regulate neural crest development interact with mutations in the BRAF oncogene, which is the most commonly mutated gene in human melanoma(1). We have used zebrafish embryos to identify the initiating transcriptional events that occur on activation of human BRAF(V600E) (which encodes an amino acid substitution mutant of BRAF) in the neural crest lineage. Zebrafish embryos that are transgenic for mitfa:BRAF(V600E) and lack p53 (also known as tp53) have a gene signature that is enriched for markers of multipotent neural crest cells, and neural crest progenitors from these embryos fail to terminally differentiate. To determine whether these early transcriptional events are important for melanoma pathogenesis, we performed a chemical genetic screen to identify small-molecule suppressors of the neural crest lineage, which were then tested for their effects on melanoma. One class of compound, inhibitors of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), for example leflunomide, led to an almost complete abrogation of neural crest development in zebrafish and to a reduction in the self-renewal of mammalian neural crest stem cells. Leflunomide exerts these effects by inhibiting the transcriptional elongation of genes that are required for neural crest development and melanoma growth. When used alone or in combination with a specific inhibitor of the BRAF(V600E) oncogene, DHODH inhibition led to a marked decrease in melanoma growth both in vitro and in mouse xenograft studies. Taken together, these studies highlight developmental pathways in neural crest cells that have a direct bearing on melanoma formation.","[White, Richard Mark; Cech, Jennifer; Ratanasirintrawoot, Sutheera; Burke, Christopher J.; Langdon, Erin; Kaufman, Charles; Datta, Sumon; Zon, Leonard I.] Harvard Univ, Stem Cell Program & Hematol Oncol, Childrens Hosp Boston,Med Sch, Howard Hughes Med Inst,Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [White, Richard Mark; Kaufman, Charles] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Lin, Charles Y.; Rahl, Peter B.; Young, Richard A.] Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Lin, Charles Y.; Young, Richard A.] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Tomlinson, Matthew L.; Wheeler, Grant N.] Univ E Anglia, Sch Biol Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Mosher, Jack; Morrison, Sean] Univ Michigan, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Ctr Stem Cell Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Chen, Frank] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Long, Hannah K.] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Kramer, Martin] Genzyme Corp, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Neuberg, Donna] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Biostat & Computat Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Granter, Scott] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Zon, LI (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Stem Cell Program & Hematol Oncol, Childrens Hosp Boston,Med Sch, Howard Hughes Med Inst,Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",zon@enders.tch.harvard.edu,"Wheeler, Grant/D-3023-2009; Young, Richard/F-6495-2012; Long, Hannah/A-6301-2013","Wheeler, Grant/0000-0002-4335-8577; Young, Richard/0000-0001-8855-8647; Morrison, Sean/0000-0003-1587-8329",Howard Hughes Medical Institute; National Cancer Institute (National Institutes of Health); American Society for Clinical Oncology; National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and SkinDiseases (National Institutes of Health); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/Pfizer,"We thank G.

This heterogeneity in treatment response could result from genetic modifiers that regulate the degree to which tumour cells are dependent on mutant EGFR. Through a pooled RNA interference screen, we show that knockdown of FAS and several components of the NF-kappa B pathway specifically enhanced cell death induced by the EGFR TKI erlotinib in EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells. Activation of NF-kappa B through overexpression of c-FLIP or IKK (also known as CFLAR and IKBKB, respectively), or silencing of I kappa B (also known as NFKBIA), rescued EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells from EGFR TKI treatment. Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of NF-kappa B enhanced erlotinib-induced apoptosis in erlotinib-sensitive and erlotinib-resistant EGFR-mutant lung cancer models. Increased expression of the NF-kappa B inhibitor I kappa B predicted for improved response and survival in EGFR-mutant lung cancer patients treated with EGFR TKI. These data identify NF-kappa B as a potential companion drug target, together with EGFR, in EGFR-mutant lung cancers and provide insight into the mechanisms by which tumour cells escape from oncogene dependence.","[Bivona, Trever G.; Hieronymus, Haley; Moonsamy, Philicia; Dahlman, Kimberly; Sawyers, Charles L.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Human Oncol & Pathogenesis Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Parker, Joel] Express Anal Inc, Durham, NC 27713 USA; [Chang, Kenneth; Hannon, Gregory] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; [Taron, Miquel; Rosell, Rafael; Costa, Carlota] Hosp Badalona Germans Trias & Pujol, Catalan Inst Oncol, Barcelona 08916, Spain; [Taron, Miquel; Rosell, Rafael; Costa, Carlota] USP Dexeus Univ Inst, Barcelona 08028, Spain; [Hannon, Gregory; Sawyers, Charles L.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chevy Chase, MD 20815 USA","Sawyers, CL (reprint author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Human Oncol & Pathogenesis Program, 1275 York Ave,Box 20, New York, NY 10065 USA.",sawyersc@mskcc.org,"Sawyers, Charles/G-5327-2016",,Charles A.

Direct mapping of chromatin modification marks and transcriptional factor binding sites genome-wide(1,2) has successfully identified specific subtypes of regulatory elements(3). In Drosophila several pioneering studies have provided genome-wide identification of Polycomb response elements(4), chromatin states(5), transcription factor binding sites(6-9), RNA polymerase II regulation(8) and insulator elements(10); however, comprehensive annotation of the regulatory genome remains a significant challenge. Here we describe results from the modENCODE cis-regulatory annotation project. We produced a map of the Drosophila melanogaster regulatory genome on the basis of more than 300 chromatin immunoprecipitation data sets for eight chromatin features, five histone deacetylases and thirty-eight site-specific transcription factors at different stages of development. Using these data we inferred more than 20,000 candidate regulatory elements and validated a subset of predictions for promoters, enhancers and insulators in vivo. We identified also nearly 2,000 genomic regions of dense transcription factor binding associated with chromatin activity and accessibility. We discovered hundreds of new transcription factor co-binding relationships and defined a transcription factor network with over 800 potential regulatory relationships.","[Negre, Nicolas; Brown, Christopher D.; Ma, Lijia; Spokony, Rebecca F.; Davis, Melissa B.; Domanus, Marc; Morrison, Carolyn A.; Zieba, Jennifer; Suchy, Sarah; Senderowicz, Lionel; Victorsen, Alec; Bild, Nicholas A.; Grundstad, A.

These two processes use two single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding proteins, replication protein A (RPA) and protection of telomeres 1 (POT1). Although RPA and POT1 each have a critical role at telomeres, how they function in concert is not clear. POT1 ablation leads to activation of the ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) checkpoint kinase at telomeres(1,2), suggesting that POT1 antagonizes RPA binding to telomeric ssDNA. Unexpectedly, we found that purified POT1 and its functional partner TPP1 are unable to prevent RPA binding to telomeric ssDNA efficiently. In cell extracts, we identified a novel activity that specifically displaces RPA, but not POT1, from telomeric ssDNA. Using purified protein, here we show that the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNPA1) recapitulates the RPA displacing activity. The RPA displacing activity is inhibited by the telomeric repeat-containing RNA (TERRA) in early S phase, but is then unleashed in late S phase when TERRA levels decline at telomeres(3). Interestingly, TERRA also promotes POT1 binding to telomeric ssDNA by removing hnRNPA1, suggesting that the reaccumulation of TERRA after S phase helps to complete the RPA-to-POT1 switch on telomeric ssDNA. Together, our data suggest that hnRNPA1, TERRA and POT1 act in concert to displace RPA from telomeric ssDNA after DNA replication, and promote telomere capping to preserve genomic integrity.","[Flynn, Rachel Litman; Centore, Richard C.; Tse, Alice; Zou, Lee] Harvard Univ, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Sch Med, Ctr Canc, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Zou, Lee] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [O'Sullivan, Roderick J.; Karlseder, Jan] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Mol & Cellular Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Rai, Rekha; Chang, Sandy] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Lab Med, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Zhou Songyang] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Zou, L (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Sch Med, Ctr Canc, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA.",zou.lee@mgh.harvard.edu,"rai, rekha/A-3680-2012",,"National Institutes of Health (NIH) [5T32CA009216-28, F32-GM089150, CA133249, CA129037, GM06525, AG025837, GM076388]; American Cancer Society [0902501]; George E.

In particular, the high degree of control of experimental parameters has allowed the study of many interesting phenomena, such as quantum phase transitions and quantum spin dynamics. Here we demonstrate how such control can be implemented at the most fundamental level of a single spin at a specific site of an optical lattice. Using a tightly focused laser beam together with a microwave field, we were able to flip the spin of individual atoms in a Mott insulator with sub-diffraction-limited resolution, well below the lattice spacing. The Mott insulator provided us with a large two-dimensional array of perfectly arranged atoms, in which we created arbitrary spin patterns by sequentially addressing selected lattice sites after freezing out the atom distribution. We directly monitored the tunnelling quantum dynamics of single atoms in the lattice prepared along a single line, and observed that our addressing scheme leaves the atoms in the motional ground state. The results should enable studies of entropy transport and the quantum dynamics of spin impurities, the implementation of novel cooling schemes, and the engineering of quantum many-body phases and various quantum information processing applications.","[Weitenberg, Christof; Endres, Manuel; Sherson, Jacob F.; Cheneau, Marc; Schauss, Peter; Fukuhara, Takeshi; Bloch, Immanuel; Kuhr, Stefan] Max Planck Inst Quantum Opt, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Bloch, Immanuel] Univ Munich, D-80799 Munich, Germany","Kuhr, S (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Quantum Opt, Hans Kopfermann Str 1, D-85748 Garching, Germany.",stefan.kuhr@mpq.mpg.de,"Bloch, Immanuel/G-3174-2010; Kuhr, Stefan/F-7296-2011; Fukuhara, Takeshi/A-6254-2014; Cheneau, Marc/O-9312-2014","Bloch, Immanuel/0000-0002-0679-4759; Fukuhara, Takeshi/0000-0002-6702-9882; Cheneau, Marc/0000-0001-7261-566X; Schauss, Peter/0000-0002-8505-5195",MPG; DFG; Stiftung Rheinland-Pfalzfur Innovation; Carl-Zeiss Stiftung; EU; JSPS,"We thank W.

DICER1 knockdown induces accumulation of Alu RNA in human RPE cells and Alu-like B1 and B2 RNAs in mouse RPE. Alu RNA is increased in the RPE of humans with GA, and this pathogenic RNA induces human RPE cytotoxicity and RPE degeneration in mice. Antisense oligonucleotides targeting Alu/B1/B2 RNAs prevent DICER1 depletion-induced RPE degeneration despite global miRNA downregulation.

The activated, hexameric MecA-ClpC molecular machine harnesses the energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis to unfold specific substrate proteins and translocate the unfolded polypeptide to the ClpP protease for degradation. Here we report three relatedcrystal structures: a heterodimer between MecA and the amino domain of ClpC, a heterododecamer between MecA and D2-deleted ClpC, and a hexameric complex between MecA and full-length ClpC. In conjunction with biochemical analyses, these structures reveal the organizational principles behind the hexameric MecA-ClpC complex, explain the molecular mechanisms for MecA-mediated ClpC activation and provide mechanistic insights into the function of the MecA-ClpC molecular machine.

Here we present the crystal structure of a TrkH from Vibrio parahaemolyticus. TrkH is a homodimer, and each protomer contains an ion permeation pathway. A selectivity filter, similar in architecture to those of K(+) channels but significantly shorter, is lined by backbone and side-chain oxygen atoms. Functional studies showed that TrkH is selective for permeation of K(+) and Rb(+) over smaller ions such as Na(+) or Li(+). Immediately intracellular to the selectivity filter are an intramembrane loop and an arginine residue, both highly conserved, which constrict the permeation pathway. Substituting the arginine with an alanine significantly increases the rate of K(+) flux. These results reveal the molecular basis of K(+) selectivity and suggest a novel gating mechanism for this large and important family of membrane transport proteins.","[Cao, Yu; Huang, Hua; Levin, Elena J.; Kabaleeswaran, Venkataraman; Pan, Yaping; Weng, Jun; Zhou, Ming] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Physiol & Cellular Biophys, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Jin, Xiangshu] Columbia Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, Ctr Computat Biol & Bioinformat, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Derebe, Mehabaw Getahun; Ye, Sheng; Jiang, Youxing] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Physiol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Derebe, Mehabaw Getahun; Ye, Sheng; Jiang, Youxing] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Punta, Marco; Love, James; Kloss, Brian; Bruni, Renato; Rost, Burkhard] New York Struct Biol Ctr, NewYork Consortium Membrane Prot Struct, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Punta, Marco; Rost, Burkhard] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Comp Sci, D-85748 Munich, Germany; [Punta, Marco; Rost, Burkhard] Tech Univ Munich, Inst Adv Study, D-85748 Munich, Germany; [Quick, Matthias; Javitch, Jonathan A.] Columbia Univ, Ctr Mol Recognit, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Quick, Matthias; Javitch, Jonathan A.] Columbia Univ, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Quick, Matthias] New York State Psychiat Inst & Hosp, Div Mol Therapeut, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Javitch, Jonathan A.] Columbia Univ, Dept Pharmacol, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Rajashankar, Kanagalaghatta R.] Cornell Univ, NE CAT, Adv Photon Source, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Argonne, IL 60439 USA","Zhou, M (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Physiol & Cellular Biophys, 630 W 168th St, New York, NY 10032 USA.",mz2140@columbia.edu,,"Martinez-Hackert, Erik/0000-0002-6182-7023","U.S. National Institutes of Health [HL086392, DK088057, GM05026-sub0007]; American Heart Association [0630148N]; National Institute of General Medical Sciences [GM05026]","Data for this study were measured at beamlines X4A, X4C, X25 and X29 of the National Synchrotron Light Source and the NE-CAT 24ID-C and E at the Advanced Photon Source.

The carriers destroy the antiferromagnetic order, but strong spin fluctuations persist throughout the superconducting phase and are intimately linked to superconductivity(2). Neutron scattering measurements of spin fluctuations in hole-doped copper oxides have revealed an unusual 'hour-glass' feature in the momentum-resolved magnetic spectrum that is present in a wide range of superconducting and non-superconducting materials(3-15). There is no widely accepted explanation for this feature. One possibility is that it derives from a pattern of alternating spin and charge stripes(16), and this idea is supported by measurements on stripe-ordered La(1.875)Ba(0.125)CuO(4) (ref. 15). Many copper oxides without stripe order, however, also exhibit an hour-glass spectrum(3-12). Here we report the observation of an hour-glass magnetic spectrum in a hole-doped antiferromagnet from outside the family of superconducting copper oxides. Our system has stripe correlations and is an insulator, which means that its magnetic dynamics can conclusively be ascribed to stripes. The results provide compelling evidence that the hour-glass spectrum in the copper oxide superconductors arises from fluctuating stripes.","[Boothroyd, A.

Although the Hamiltonian of a complex system may not be known or solvable, Wigner conjectured(1) that the statistics of energy level spacings would be the same as for the eigenvalues of large randommatrices. This has explained key characteristics of neutron scattering spectra(2). Subsequently, Thouless and co-workers argued(3,4) that the metal-insulator transition in disordered systems(4-6) could be described by a single parameter, the ratio of the average width and spacing of electronic energy levels: when this dimension-less ratio falls below unity, conductivity is suppressed by Anderson localization(5) of the electronic wave function. However, because of spectral congestion due to the overlap of modes(7-9), even for localized waves, a comprehensive modal description of wave propagation has not been realized. Here we show that the field speckle pattern(10) of transmitted radiation-in this case, a microwave field transmitted through randomly packed alumina spheres-can be decomposed into a sum of the patterns of the individual modes of the medium and the central frequency and linewidth of each mode can be found. We find strong correlation between modal field speckle patterns, which leads to destructive interference between modes. This allows us to explain complexities of steady state and pulsed transmission of localized waves and to harmonize wave and particle descriptions of diffusion.","[Wang, Jing; Genack, Azriel Z.] CUNY Queens Coll, Dept Phys, Flushing, NY 11367 USA","Genack, AZ (reprint author), CUNY Queens Coll, Dept Phys, Flushing, NY 11367 USA.",genack@qc.edu,"Wang, Jing/D-6495-2014","Wang, Jing/0000-0001-7234-4388",National Science Foundation [DMR0907285],This research was supported by the National Science Foundation (DMR0907285).,,33,63,63,0,40,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Mar,2011,471,7338,,,,,345,+,,10.1038/nature09824,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,735UE,WOS:000288444000038,21412335.0,No,,,11/20/17,azriel z.,genack,na,na,na,na,na

The most extreme hyperthermal was the 170 thousand year (kyr) interval(2) of 5-7 degrees C global warming(3) during the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM, 56 Myr ago). The PETM is widely attributed to massive release of greenhouse gases from buried sedimentary carbon reservoirs(1,3,6,11,14-17), and other, comparatively modest, hyperthermals have also been linked to the release of sedimentary carbon(3,6,11,16,17). Here we show, using new 2.4-Myr-long Eocene deep ocean records, that the comparatively modest hyperthermals are much more numerous than previously documented, paced by the eccentricity of Earth's orbit and have shorter durations (40 kyr) and more rapid recovery phases than the PETM. These findings point to the operation of fundamentally different forcing and feedback mechanisms than for the PETM, involving redistribution of carbon among Earth's readily exchangeable surface reservoirs rather than carbon exhumation from, and subsequent burial back into, the sedimentary reservoir. Specifically, we interpret our records to indicate repeated, large-scale releases of dissolved organic carbon (at least 1,600 giga-tonnes) from the ocean by ventilation (strengthened oxidation) of the ocean interior. The rapid recovery of the carbon cycle following each Eocene hyperthermal strongly suggests that carbon was re-sequestered by the ocean, rather than the much slower process of silicate rock weathering proposed for the PETM1,3. Our findings suggest that these pronounced climate warming events were driven not by repeated releases of carbon from buried sedimentary sources(3,6,11,16,17), but, rather, by patterns of surficial carbon redistribution familiar from younger intervals of Earth history.","[Sexton, Philip F.; Norris, Richard D.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Sexton, Philip F.; Wilson, Paul A.; Paelike, Heiko; Bolton, Clara T.; Gibbs, Samantha] Univ Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr Southampton, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England; [Westerhold, Thomas; Roehl, Ursula] Univ Bremen, MARUM Ctr Marine Environm Sci, D-28359 Bremen, Germany","Sexton, PF (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",P.F.Sexton@open.ac.uk,"Palike, Heiko/A-6560-2008; Westerhold, Thomas/D-4581-2011; Bolton, Clara/A-2423-2012; Rohl, Ursula/G-5986-2011","Palike, Heiko/0000-0003-3386-0923; Rohl, Ursula/0000-0001-9469-7053; Westerhold, Thomas/0000-0001-8151-4684",US NSF and; European Commission; Leverhulme Trust; Natural Environment Research Council UK; Philip Leverhulme Prize; DFG-Leibniz Center for Surface Process and Climate Studies at the University of Potsdam; DFG,"We thank M.

Hence, it is unclear precisely how Earth material properties translate to continental deformation zones ranging from tens to thousands of kilometres in width, why deforming zones are sometimes interspersed with non-deforming blocks and why large earthquakes occasionally rupture in otherwise stable continental interiors. An important clue comes from observations that mountain belts and rift zones cyclically form at the same locations despite separation across vast gulfs of time(3) (dubbed the Wilson tectonic cycle), accompanied by inversion of extensional basins(4) and reactivation of faults and other structures formed in previous deformation events(5). Here we show that the abundance of crustal quartz, the weakest mineral in continental rocks(2), may strongly condition continental temperature and deformation. We use EarthScope seismic receiver functions(6), gravity and surface heat flow measurements(7) to estimate thickness and seismic velocity ratio, v(P)/v(S), of continental crust in the western United States. The ratio v(P)/v(S) is relatively insensitive to temperature but very sensitive to quartz abundance(8,9). Our results demonstrate a surprising correlation of low crustal v(P)/v(S) with both higher lithospheric temperature and deformation of the Cordillera, the mountainous region of the western United States. The most plausible explanation for the relationship to temperature is a robust dynamical feedback, in which ductile strain first localizes in relatively weak, quartz-rich crust, and then initiatesprocesses that promote advective warming, hydration and further weakening. The feedback mechanism-proposed here would not only explain stationarity and spatial distributions of deformation, but also lend insight into the timing and distribution of thermal uplift(10) and observations of deep-derived fluids in springs(11).","[Lowry, Anthony R.] Utah State Univ, Dept Geol, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Perez-Gussinye, Marta] Univ London, Dept Earth Sci, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England","Lowry, AR (reprint author), Utah State Univ, Dept Geol, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",Tony.Lowry@usu.edu,"Lowry, Anthony/F-8158-2012; Perez-Gussinye, Marta/R-1704-2016","Lowry, Anthony/0000-0001-6023-3090; Perez-Gussinye, Marta/0000-0003-4109-1810","National Science Foundation [EAR-0454541, EAR-0955909]; Utah State University","We thank K.

Anxiety disorders represent the most common of psychiatric diseases (28% lifetime prevalence) 2 and contribute to the aetiology of major depression and substance abuse(3,4). Although it has been proposed that the amygdala, a brain region important for emotional processing(5-8), has a role in anxiety(9-13), the neural mechanisms that control anxiety remain unclear. Here we explore the neural circuits underlying anxiety-related behaviours by using optogenetics with two-photon microscopy, anxiety assays in freely moving mice, and electrophysiology. With the capability of optogenetics(14-16) to control not only cell types but also specific connections between cells, we observed that temporally precise optogenetic stimulation of basolateral amygdala (BLA) terminals in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA)-achieved by viral transduction of the BLA with a codon-optimized channelrhodopsin followed by restricted illumination in the downstream CeA-exerted an acute, reversible anxiolytic effect. Conversely, selective optogenetic inhibition of the same projection with a third-generation halorhodopsin(15) (eNpHR3.0) increased anxiety-related behaviours. Importantly, these effects were not observed with direct optogenetic control of BLA somata, possibly owing to recruitment of antagonistic downstream structures. Together, these results implicate specific BLACeA projections as critical circuit elements for acute anxiety control in the mammalian brain, and demonstrate the importance of optogenetically targeting defined projections, beyond simply targeting cell types, in the study of circuit function relevant to neuropsychiatric disease.","[Tye, Kay M.; Prakash, Rohit; Kim, Sung-Yon; Fenno, Lief E.; Grosenick, Logan; Zarabi, Hosniya; Thompson, Kimberly R.; Gradinaru, Viviana; Ramakrishnan, Charu; Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Dept Bioengn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Prakash, Rohit; Kim, Sung-Yon; Fenno, Lief E.; Grosenick, Logan; Gradinaru, Viviana; Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Neurosci Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, CNC Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Deisseroth, K (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Bioengn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",deissero@stanford.edu,"Tye, Kay/J-6158-2013","Tye, Kay/0000-0002-2435-0182; Ramakrishnan, Charu/0000-0002-3474-6332; Kim, Sung-Yon/0000-0003-0791-7308",NIMH [1F32MH088010-01]; NARSAD; Samsung; NSF [0801700]; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Reorganization and Plasticity to Accelerate Injury Recovery [N66001-10-C-2010]; Alice Woo Foundation; Albert Yu Foundation; Snyder Foundation; McKnight Foundation; NIDA; NIH,"We would like to thank P.

This caspase has also been implicated in non-apoptotic pathways that regulate Fas-associated via death domain (FADD)dependent signalling and other less defined biological processes as diverse as innate immune signalling and myeloid or lymphoid differentiation patterns(1). Casp8 suppresses RIP3-RIP1 (also known as RIPK3-RIPK1) kinase complex-dependent(2-4) necroptosis(5) that follows death receptor activation as well as a RIP3-dependent, RIP(1)-independent necrotic pathway that has emerged as a host defence mechanism against murine cytomegalovirus(6). Disruption of Casp8 expression leads to embryonic lethality in mice between embryonic days 10.5 and 11.5 (ref. 7). Thus, Casp8 may naturally hold alternative RIP3-dependent death pathways in check in addition to promoting apoptosis. We find that RIP3 is responsible for the mid-gestational death of Casp8-deficient embryos. Remarkably, Casp8(-/-)Rip3(-/-) double mutant mice are viable and mature into fertile adults with a full immune complement of myeloid and lymphoid cell types. These mice seem immunocompetent but develop lymphadenopathy by four months of age marked by accumulation of abnormal T cells in the periphery, a phenotype reminiscent of mice with Fas-deficiency (lpr/lpr; also known as Fas). Thus, Casp8 contributes to homeostatic control in the adult immune system; however, RIP3 and Casp8 are together completely dispensable for mammalian development.","[Kaiser, William J.; Upton, Jason W.; Livingston-Rosanoff, Devon; Daley-Bauer, Lisa P.; Mocarski, Edward S.] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Emory Vaccine Ctr, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Long, Alyssa B.; Caspary, Tamara] Emory Univ, Dept Human Genet, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Hakem, Razqallah] Univ Toronto, Dept Med Biophys, Toronto, ON M5G 2M9, Canada; [Hakem, Razqallah] Univ Hlth Network, Ontario Canc Inst, Toronto, ON M5G 2M9, Canada","Kaiser, WJ (reprint author), Emory Univ, Sch Med, Emory Vaccine Ctr, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",wkaiser@emory.edu,"Kaiser, William/A-3079-2012","Caspary, Tamara/0000-0002-6579-7589","Georgia Cancer Coalition; NIH [R01 AI20211, AI30363]","We acknowledge D.

Death receptors are essential for immune homeostasis, but dispensable during embryogenesis. Surprisingly, Fadd(-/-) mice die in utero(4,5) and conditional deletion of FADD leads to impaired lymphocyte proliferation(6,7). How FADD regulates embryogenesis and lymphocyte responses has been a long-standing enigma. FADD could directly bind to RIP1 (also known as RIPK1), a serine/threonine kinase that mediates both necrosis and NF-kappa B activation. Here we show that Fadd(-/-) embryos contain raised levels of RIP1 and exhibit massive necrosis. To investigate a potential in vivo functional interaction between RIP1 and FADD, null alleles of RIP1 were crossed into Fadd(-/-) mice. Notably, RIP1 deficiency allowed normal embryogenesis of Fadd(-/-) mice. Conversely, the developmental defect of Rip1(-/-) lymphocytes was partially corrected by FADD deletion. Furthermore, RIP1 deficiency fully restored normal proliferation in Fadd(-/-) T cells but not in Fadd(-/-) B cells. Fadd(-/-)Rip1(-/-) double-knockout T cells are resistant to death induced by Fas or TNF-alpha and show reduced NF-kappa B activity. Therefore, our data demonstrate an unexpected cell-type-specific interplay between FADD and RIP1, which is critical for the regulation of apoptosis and necrosis during embryogenesis and lymphocyte function.","[Zhang, Haibing; Zhou, Xiaohui; Li, Jinghe; Zhang, Jianke] Thomas Jefferson Univ, Kimmel Canc Ctr, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA; [McQuade, Thomas; Chan, Francis Ka-Ming] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Worcester, MA 01655 USA","Zhang, JK (reprint author), Thomas Jefferson Univ, Kimmel Canc Ctr, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA.",francis.chan@umassmed.edu; jzhang@mail.jci.tju.edu,"Chan, Francis/E-9647-2014","Chan, Francis/0000-0002-4803-8353; Zhang, Jianke/0000-0002-5822-2226; Chan, Francis K.L./0000-0001-7388-2436","NIH [CA95454, AI083915, AI076788, AI083497, AI017672]; W.

In contrast, several well-characterized lymphoma entities still lack disease-defining translocation events. To identify novel fusion transcripts resulting from translocations, we investigated two Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines by whole-transcriptome paired-end sequencing (RNA-seq). Here we show a highly expressed gene fusion involving the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II transactivator CIITA (MHC2TA) in KM-H2 cells. In a subsequent evaluation of 263 B-cell lymphomas, we also demonstrate that genomic CIITA breaks are highly recurrent in primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (38%) and classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) (15%). Furthermore, we find that CIITA is a promiscuous partner of various in-frame gene fusions, and we report that CIITA gene alterations impact survival in primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL). As functional consequences of CIITA gene fusions, we identify downregulation of surface HLA class II expression and overexpression of ligands of the receptor molecule programmed cell death 1 (CD274/PDL1 and CD273/PDL2). These receptor-ligand interactions have been shown to impact anti-tumour immune responses in several cancers(3), whereas decreased MHC class II expression has been linked to reduced tumour cell immunogenicity(4).

In human sperm, progesterone stimulates a Ca2+ increase by a non-genomic mechanism(1-3). The Ca2+ signal has been proposed to control chemotaxis, hyperactivation and acrosomal exocytosis of sperm(4-8). However, the underlying signalling mechanism has remained mysterious. Here we show that progesterone activates the sperm-specific, pH-sensitive CatSper Ca2+ channel(9-11). We found that both progesterone and alkaline pH stimulate a rapid Ca2+ influx with almost no latency, incompatible with a signalling pathway involving metabotropic receptors and second messengers. The Ca2+ signals evoked by alkaline pH and progesterone are inhibited by the Ca-v channel blockers NNC 55-0396 and mibefradil. Patch-clamp recordings from sperm reveal an alkaline-activated current carried by mono-and divalent ions that exhibits all the hallmarks of sperm-specific CatSper Ca2+ channels(10,11). Progesterone substantially enhances the CatSper current. The alkaline- and progesterone-activated CatSper current is inhibited by both drugs. Our results resolve a long-standing controversy over the non-genomic progesterone signalling. In human sperm, either the CatSper channel itself or an associated protein serves as the non-genomic progesterone receptor. The identification of CatSper channel blockers will greatly facilitate the study of Ca2+ signalling in sperm and help to define further the physiological role of progesterone and CatSper.","[Struenker, Timo; Goodwin, Normann; Brenker, Christoph; Kashikar, Nachiket D.; Seifert, Reinhard; Kaupp, U.

It attracts spermatozoa towards the egg and helps them penetrate the egg's protective vestments(1). Progesterone induces Ca2+ influx into spermatozoa(1-3) and triggers multiple Ca2+-dependent physiological responses essential for successful fertilization, such as sperm hyperactivation, acrosome reaction and chemotaxis towards the egg(4-8). As an ovarian hormone, progesterone acts by regulating gene expression through a well-characterized progesterone nuclear receptor(9). However, the effect of progesterone upon transcriptionally silent spermatozoa remains unexplained and is believed to be mediated by a specialized, non-genomic membrane progesterone receptor(5,10). The identity of this non-genomic progesterone receptor and the mechanism by which it causes Ca2+ entry remain fundamental unresolved questions in human reproduction. Here we elucidate the mechanism of the non-genomic action of progesterone on human spermatozoa by identifying the Ca2+ channel activated by progesterone. By applying the patch-clamp technique to mature human spermatozoa, we found that nanomolar concentrations of progesterone dramatically potentiate CatSper, a pH-dependent Ca2+ channel of the sperm flagellum. We demonstrate that human CatSper is synergistically activated by elevation of intracellular pH and extracellular progesterone. Interestingly, human CatSper can be further potentiated by prostaglandins, but apparently through a binding site other than that of progesterone. Because our experimental conditions did not support second messenger signalling, CatSper or a directly associated protein serves as the elusive non-genomic progesterone receptor of sperm. Given that the CatSper-associated progesterone receptor is sperm specific and structurally different from the genomic progesterone receptor, it represents a promising target for the development of a new class of non-hormonal contraceptives.","[Lishko, Polina V.; Botchkina, Inna L.; Kirichok, Yuriy] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Physiol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA","Kirichok, Y (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Physiol, UCSF Mail Code 2140,Genentech Hall Room N272F,600, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA.",yuriy.kirichok@ucsf.edu,,,UCSF,This work was funded by the UCSF Program for Breakthrough Biomedical Research.,,30,226,250,6,54,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Mar,2011,471,7338,,,,,387,+,,10.1038/nature09767,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,735UE,WOS:000288444000047,21412339.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,yuriy,kirichok,na,na,na,na,na

To allow fork progression, this superhelical tension has to be removed by topoisomerases, which operate by introducing transient DNA breaks(1). Positive supercoiling can also be diminished if the advancing fork rotates along the DNA helix, but then sister chromatid intertwinings form in its wake(1,2). Despite these insights it remains largely unknown how replication-induced superhelical stress is dealt with on linear, eukaryotic chromosomes. Here we show that this stress increases with the length of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosomes. This highlights the possibility that superhelical tension is handled on a chromosome scale and not only within topologically closed chromosomal domains as the current view predicts. We found that inhibition of type I topoisomerases leads to a late replication delay of longer, but not shorter, chromosomes. This phenotype is also displayed by cells expressing mutated versions of the cohesin-and condensin-related Smc5/6 complex. The frequency of chromosomal association sites of the Smc5/6 complex increases in response to chromosome lengthening, chromosome circularization, or inactivation of topoisomerase 2, all having the potential to increase the number of sister chromatid intertwinings(3). Furthermore, nonfunctional Smc6 reduces the accumulation of intertwined sister plasmids after one round of replication in the absence of topoisomerase 2 function. Our results demonstrate that the length of a chromosome influences the need of superhelical tension release in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and allow us to propose a model where the Smc5/6 complex facilitates fork rotation by sequestering nascent chromatid intertwinings that form behind the replication machinery.","[Kegel, Andreas; Betts-Lindroos, Hanna; Kanno, Takaharu; Jeppsson, Kristian; Strom, Lena; Sjogren, Camilla] Karolinska Inst, Dept Cell & Mol Biol, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Katou, Yuki; Itoh, Takehiko] Tokyo Inst Technol, Grad Sch Biosci, Lab Silico Funct Genom, Midori Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2268501, Japan; [Shirahige, Katsuhiko] Univ Tokyo, Inst Mol & Cellular Biosci, Res Ctr Epigenet Dis, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130032, Japan","Sjogren, C (reprint author), Karolinska Inst, Dept Cell & Mol Biol, Eulersvag 3, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden.",camilla.sjogren@ki.se,"Itoh, Takehiko/E-8873-2014","Itoh, Takehiko/0000-0002-6113-557X; Sjogren Bjorkegren, Camilla/0000-0001-7354-9270; Lindroos, Hanna/0000-0002-8455-8452",JST; SSF; Vinnova,"We thank K.

This duality calls for a mechanism that selectively removes the large-scale heterogeneities associated with the incremental assembly(4) of these magmatic systems and yet occurs rapidly despite crystal-rich, viscous conditions seemingly resistant to mixing(2,5). Here we show that a simple dynamic template can unify a wide range of apparently contradictory observations from both large plutonic bodies and volcanic systems by a mechanism of rapid remobilization (unzipping) of highly viscous crystal-rich mushes. We demonstrate that this remobilization can lead to rapid overturn and produce the observed juxtaposition of magmatic materials with very disparate ages and complex chemical zoning. What distinguishes our model is the recognition that the process has two stages. Initially, a stiff mushy magma is reheated from below, producing a reduction in crystallinity that leads to the growth of a subjacent buoyant mobile layer. When the thickening mobile layer becomes sufficiently buoyant, it penetrates the overlying viscous mushy magma. This second stage rapidly exports homogenized material from the lower mobile layer to the top of the system, and leads to partial overturn within the viscous mush itself as an additional mechanism of mixing. Model outputs illustrate that unzipping can rapidly produce large amounts of mobile magma available for eruption. The agreement between calculated and observed unzipping rates for historical eruptions at Pinatubo and at Montserrat demonstrates the general applicability of the model. This mechanism furthers our understanding of both the formation of periodically homogenized plutons (crust building) and of ignimbrites by large eruptions.","[Burgisser, Alain] Univ Tours, Univ Orleans, CNRS INSU, Inst Sci Terre Orleans, F-45071 Orleans 2, France; [Bergantz, George W.] Univ Washington, Dept Earth & Space Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Burgisser, A (reprint author), Univ Tours, Univ Orleans, CNRS INSU, Inst Sci Terre Orleans, 1A Rue Ferolerie, F-45071 Orleans 2, France.",burgisse@cnrs-orleans.fr,,,ERC [202844],We thank O.

Here we show that the relationship between structure and function can be studied in the cortex with a combination of in vivo physiology and network anatomy. We used two-photon calcium imaging to characterize a functional property-the preferred stimulus orientation-of a group of neurons in the mouse primary visual cortex. Large-scale electron microscopy of serial thin sections was then used to trace a portion of these neurons' local network.

The analysis of neuronal connectivity is possible with electron microscopy, but technological limitations have impeded the acquisition of high-resolution data on a large enough scale. Here we show, using serial block-face electron microscopy and two-photon calcium imaging, that the dendrites of mouse starburst amacrine cells make highly specific synapses with direction-selective ganglion cells depending on the ganglion cell's preferred direction. Our findings indicate that a structural (wiring) asymmetry contributes to the computation of direction selectivity. The nature of this asymmetry supports some models of direction selectivity and rules out others. It also puts constraints on the developmental mechanisms behind the formation of synaptic connections.

Overall, about 39% of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and 41% of follicular lymphoma cases display genomic deletions and/or somatic mutations that remove or inactivate the HAT coding domain of these two genes. These lesions usually affect one allele, suggesting that reduction in HAT dosage is important for lymphomagenesis. We demonstrate specific defects in acetylation-mediated inactivation of the BCL6 oncoprotein and activation of the p53 tumour suppressor.

Realizations of harmonic oscillators in the quantum regime include electromagnetic fields in a cavity(1-3) and the mechanical modes of a trapped atom(4) or macroscopic solid(5). Quantized interaction between two motional modes of an individual trapped ion has been achieved by coupling through optical fields(6), and entangled motion of two ions in separate locations has been accomplished indirectly through their internal states(7). However, direct controllable coupling between quantized mechanical oscillators held in separate locations has not been realized previously. Here we implement such coupling through the mutual Coulomb interaction of two ions held in trapping potentials separated by 40 mm (similar work is reported in a related paper(8)). By tuning the confining wells into resonance, energy is exchanged between the ions at the quantum level, establishing that direct coherent motional coupling is possible for separately trapped ions.

Since this seminal work, technology has developed, and various oscillators are now available at the quantum mechanical level. For quantized electromagnetic oscillations, atoms in cavities can be used to couple electric fields(2,3). However, a quantum mechanical link between two mechanical oscillators (such as cantilevers(4,5) or the vibrational modes of trapped atoms(6) or ions(7,8)) has been rarely demonstrated and has been achieved only indirectly. Examples include the mechanical transport of atoms carrying quantum information(9) or the use of spontaneously emitted photons(10). Here we achieve direct coupling between the motional dipoles of separately trapped ions over a distance of 54 micrometres, using the dipole-dipole interaction as a quantum mechanical transmission line(11). This interaction is small between single trapped ions, but the coupling is amplified by using additional trapped ions as antennae. With three ions in each well, the interaction is increased by a factor of seven compared to the single-ion case. This enhancement facilitates bridging of larger distances and relaxes the constraints on the miniaturization of trap electrodes. The system provides a building block for quantum computers and opportunities for coupling different types of quantum systems.","[Harlander, M.; Lechner, R.; Brownnutt, M.; Blatt, R.; Haensel, W.] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Expt Phys, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Blatt, R.; Haensel, W.] Austrian Acad Sci, Inst Quantenopt & Quanteninformat, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria","Blatt, R (reprint author), Univ Innsbruck, Inst Expt Phys, Technikerstr 25, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",rainer.blatt@uibk.ac.at,,,EU; Austrian Science Fund (FWF); European Research Council (ERC); Institut fur Quanteninformation GmbH,"We thank H.

Central to this effort is the necessity of long-lived mechanical states. Previous efforts have witnessed quantum behaviour(4), but for a low-quality-factor mechanical system. The field of cavity optomechanics and electromechanics(5,6), in which a high-quality-factor mechanical oscillator is parametrically coupled to an electromagnetic cavity resonance, provides a practical architecture for cooling, manipulation and detection of motion at the quantum level(1). One requirement is strong coupling(7-9), in which the interaction between the two systems is faster than the dissipation of energy from either system. Here, by incorporating a free-standing, flexible aluminium membrane into a lumped-element superconducting resonant cavity, we have increased the single-photon coupling strength between these two systems by more than two orders of magnitude, compared to previously obtained coupling strengths. A parametric drive tone at the difference frequency between the mechanical oscillator and the cavity resonance dramatically increases the overall coupling strength, allowing us to completely enter the quantum-enabled, strong-coupling regime. This is evidenced by a maximum normal-mode splitting of nearly six bare cavity linewidths. Spectroscopic measurements of these 'dressed states' are in excellent quantitative agreement with recent theoretical predictions(10,11). The basic circuit architecture presented here provides a feasible path to ground-state cooling and subsequent coherent control and measurement of long-lived quantum states of mechanical motion.","[Teufel, J.
