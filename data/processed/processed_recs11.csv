Activation of BK channels typically requires coincident membrane depolarization and elevation in free cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i))(6,7), which are not physiological conditions for most non-excitable cells. Here we present evidence that in non-excitable LNCaP prostate cancer cells, BK channels can be activated at negative voltages without rises in [Ca(2+)](i) through their complex with an auxiliary protein, leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-containing protein 26 (LRRC26). LRRC26 modulates the gating of a BK channel by enhancing the allosteric coupling between voltage-sensor activation and the channel's closed-open transition. This finding reveals a novel auxiliary protein of a voltage- gated ion channel that gives an unprecedentedly large negative shift (similar to-140 mV) in voltage dependence and provides a molecular basis for activation of BK channels at physiological voltages and calcium levels in non-excitable cells.","[Yan, Jiusheng; Aldrich, Richard W.] Univ Texas Austin, Ctr Learning & Memory, Neurobiol Sect, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Aldrich, RW (reprint author), Univ Texas Austin, Ctr Learning & Memory, Neurobiol Sect, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",raldrich@mail.utexas.edu,,,American Heart Association,"We are grateful to I.

The structures indicate how tRNA movement is coupled with global and local conformational changes of the ribosome, in particular of the head and body of the small ribosomal subunit, and show that dynamic interactions between tRNAs and ribosomal residues confine the path of the tRNAs through the ribosome.

We compared these data sets with data sets of sequenced bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA genes and total-faecal-community DNA. Co-twins and their mothers share a significantly greater degree of similarity in their faecal bacterial communities than do unrelated individuals. In contrast, viromes are unique to individuals regardless of their degree of genetic relatedness. Despite remarkable interpersonal variations in viromes and their encoded functions, intrapersonal diversity is very low, with >95% of virotypes retained over the period surveyed, and with viromes dominated by a few temperate phages that exhibit remarkable genetic stability.

It is unclear, however, whether the accretion-disk paradigm can also account for the formation of stars more massive than about 10 solar masses(2), in which strong radiation pressure might halt mass infall(3,4). Massive stars may form by stellar merging(5), although more recent theoretical investigations suggest that the radiative-pressure limit may be overcome by considering more complex, non-spherical infall geometries(6,7). Clear observational evidence, such as the detection of compact dusty disks(8) around massive young stellar objects, is needed to identify unambiguously the formation mode of the most massive stars. Here we report near-infrared interferometric observations that spatially resolve the astronomical-unit-scale distribution of hot material around a high-mass (similar to 20 solar masses) young stellar object. The image shows an elongated structure with a size of similar to 13 x 19 astronomical units, consistent with a disk seen at an inclination angle of similar to 45 degrees. Using geometric and detailed physical models, we found a radial temperature gradient in the disk, with a dust-free region less than 9.5 astronomical units from the star, qualitatively and quantitatively similar to the disks observed in low-mass star formation. Perpendicular to the disk plane we observed a molecular outflow and two bow shocks, indicating that a bipolar outflow emanates from the inner regions of the system.","[Kraus, Stefan] Univ Michigan, Dept Astron, Ann Arbor, MI 48103 USA; [Hofmann, Karl-Heinz; Menten, Karl M.; Schertl, Dieter; Weigelt, Gerd; Wyrowski, Friedrich; Meilland, Anthony] Max Planck Inst Radioastron, D-53121 Bonn, Germany; [Meilland, Anthony; Petrov, Romain; Robbe-Dubois, Sylvie] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, CNRS, Observ Cote Azur, Lab Hippolyte Fizeau,UMR 6525, F-06108 Nice 2, France; [Perraut, Karine] Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, UMR 5571, Lab Astrophys Grenoble, F-38041 Grenoble 9, France; [Schilke, Peter] Univ Cologne, Inst Phys 1, D-50937 Cologne, Germany; [Testi, Leonardo] INAF Osservatorio Astrofis Arcetri, I-50125 Florence, Italy","Kraus, S (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Dept Astron, 500 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48103 USA.",stefankr@umich.edu,,"Kraus, Stefan/0000-0001-6017-8773",NASA,"This work was done in part under contract with the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), funded by NASA through the Sagan Fellowship Program (S.K. is a Sagan Fellow).

Unlike conventional two-dimensional electron states, these surface states are expected to be immune to localization and to overcome barriers caused by material imperfection(8-14). Previous experiments have demonstrated that topological surface states do not backscatter between equal and opposite momentum states, owing to their chiral spin texture(15-18). However, so far there is no evidence that these states in fact transmit through naturally occurring surface defects. Here we use a scanning tunnelling microscope to measure the transmission and reflection probabilities of topological surface states of antimony through naturally occurring crystalline steps separating atomic terraces. In contrast to nontopological surface states of common metals (copper, silver and gold)(19-23), which are either reflected or absorbed by atomic steps, we show that topological surface states of antimony penetrate such barriers with high probability. This demonstration of the extended nature of antimony's topological surface states suggests that such states may be useful for high current transmission even in the presence of atomic-scale irregularities-an electronic feature sought to efficiently interconnect nanoscale devices.","[Seo, Jungpil; Roushan, Pedram; Beidenkopf, Haim; Yazdani, Ali] Princeton Univ, Joseph Henry Labs, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Seo, Jungpil; Roushan, Pedram; Beidenkopf, Haim; Yazdani, Ali] Princeton Univ, Dept Phys, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Hor, Y.

Within this phase it has been unclear which electronic symmetries (if any) are broken, what the identity of any associated order parameter might be, and which microscopic electronic degrees of freedom are active. Here we report the determination of a quantitative order parameter representing intra-unit-cell nematicity: the breaking of rotational symmetry by the electronic structure within each CuO2 unit cell. We analyse spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunnelling microscope images of the intra-unit-cell states in underdoped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 + delta and, using two independent evaluation techniques, find evidence for electronic nematicity of the states close to the pseudogap energy. Moreover, we demonstrate directly that these phenomena arise from electronic differences at the two oxygen sites within each unit cell. If the characteristics of the pseudogap seen here and by other techniques all have the same microscopic origin, this phase involves weak magnetic states at the O sites that break 90 degrees-rotational symmetry within every CuO2 unit cell.","[Lawler, M.

Several thousand kimberlites have been mapped on various scales(1-4), but it is the distribution of kimberlites in the very old cratons (stable areas of the continental lithosphere that are more than 2.5 billion years old and 300 kilometres thick or more(5)) that have generated the most interest, because kimberlites from those areas are the major carriers of economically viable diamond resources. Kimberlites, which are themselves derived from depths of more than 150 kilometres, provide invaluable information on the composition of the deep subcontinental mantle lithosphere, and on melting and metasomatic processes at or near the interface with the underlying flowing mantle. Here we use plate reconstructions and tomographic images to show that the edges of the largest heterogeneities in the deepest mantle, stable for at least 200 million years and possibly for 540 million years, seem to have controlled the eruption of most Phanerozoic kimberlites. We infer that future exploration for kimberlites and their included diamonds should therefore be concentrated in continents with old cratons that once overlay these plume-generation zones at the core-mantle boundary.","[Torsvik, Trond H.; Steinberger, Bernhard] Univ Oslo, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Torsvik, Trond H.; Steinberger, Bernhard] Geol Survey Norway, Ctr Geodynam, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Torsvik, Trond H.; Burke, Kevin; Webb, Susan J.; Ashwal, Lewis D.] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Geosci, ZA-2050 Wits, South Africa; [Burke, Kevin] Univ Houston, Dept Geosci, Houston, TX 77204 USA; [Steinberger, Bernhard] German Res Ctr Geosci, Helmholtz Ctr Potsdam, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany","Torsvik, TH (reprint author), Univ Oslo, N-0316 Oslo, Norway.",trond.torsvik@ngu.no,,,Statoil; Norwegian Research Council,"We thank R.

It occurs at a depth of about 30 kilometres and provides valuable information on deep plate motion and shallow stress accumulation on the fault plane of megathrust earthquakes. Tremor has been suggested to repeat at a regular interval(1,2), migrate at various velocities(4-7) and be modulated by tidal stress(6,8,9). Here I show that some time-invariant interface property controls tremor behaviour, using precise location of tremor sources with event duration in western Shikoku in the Nankai subduction zone, Japan. In areas where tremor duration is short, tremor is more strongly affected by tidal stress and migration is inhibited. Where tremor lasts longer, diffusive migration occurs with a constant diffusivity of 10(4) m(2) s(-1). The control property may be the ratio of brittle to ductile areas, perhaps determined by the influence of mantle wedge serpentinization on the plate interface. The spatial variation of the controlling property seems to be characterized by striations in tremor source distribution, which follows either the current or previous plate subduction directions. This suggests that the striations and corresponding interface properties are formed through the subduction of inhomogeneous structure, such as seamounts, for periods as long as ten million years.","Univ Tokyo, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan","Ide, S (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Hongo 7-3-1, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",ide@eps.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"IDE, SATOSHI/G-4887-2014",,JSPS [20340115]; MEXT [21107007],"I thank G.

The oldest stem Catarrhini in the fossil record are Propliopithecoidea, known from the late Eocene to early Oligocene epochs (roughly 35-30 Myr ago) of Egypt, Oman and possibly Angola(5-10). Genome-based estimates for divergence of hominoids and cercopithecoids range into the early Oligocene(11); however, the mid-to-late Oligocene interval from 30 to 23 Myr ago has yielded little fossil evidence documenting the morphology of the last common ancestor of hominoids and cercopithecoids, the timing of their divergence, or the relationship of early stem and crown catarrhines. Here we describe the partial cranium of a new medium-sized (about 15-20 kg) fossil catarrhine, Saadanius hijazensis, dated to 29-28 Myr ago. Comparative anatomy and cladistic analysis shows that Saadanius is an advanced stem catarrhine close to the base of the hominoid-cercopithecoid clade. Saadanius is important for assessing competing hypotheses about the ancestral morphotype for crown catarrhines(1,12-14), early catarrhine phylogeny(12,15) and the age of hominoid-cercopithecoid divergence(11). Saadanius has a tubular ectotympanic but lacks synapomorphies of either group of crown Catarrhini, and we infer that the hominoid-cercopithecoid split happened later, between 29-28 and 24 Myr ago.","[Zalmout, Iyad S.; Sanders, William J.; MacLatchy, Laura M.; Gunnell, Gregg F.; Wilson, Jeffrey A.; Gingerich, Philip D.] Univ Michigan, Museum Paleontol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Zalmout, Iyad S.; Wilson, Jeffrey A.; Gingerich, Philip D.] Univ Michigan, Dept Geol Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Sanders, William J.; MacLatchy, Laura M.; Gingerich, Philip D.] Univ Michigan, Dept Anthropol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Al-Mufarreh, Yahya A.; Ali, Mohammad A.; Nasser, Abdul-Azziz H.; Al-Masari, Abdu M.; Al-Sobhi, Salih A.; Nadhra, Ayman O.; Matari, Adel H.] Saudi Geol Survey, Paleontol Unit, Jeddah 21514, Saudi Arabia","Zalmout, IS (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Museum Paleontol, 1109 Geddes Ave, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",zalmouti@umich.edu; wsanders@umich.edu; gingeric@umich.edu,"Gingerich, Philip/A-6903-2008","Gingerich, Philip/0000-0002-1550-2674",US National Science Foundation [EAR-0517773],"We thank Saudi Geological Survey (Jeddah) officials Z.

However, conservation plans focus overwhelmingly on adding new sites to current protected area estates(4). Here we show that the conservation performance of a protected area system can be radically improved, without extra expenditure, by replacing a small number of protected areas with new ones that achieve more for conservation. Replacing the least cost-effective 1% of Australia's 6,990 strictly protected areas could increase the number of vegetation types that have 15% or more of their original extent protected from 18 to 54, of a maximum possible of 58. Moreover, it increases markedly the area that can be protected, with no increase in overall spending. This new paradigm for protected area system expansion could yield huge improvements to global conservation at a time when competition for land is increasingly intense.","[Fuller, Richard A.; McDonald-Madden, Eve; Wilson, Kerrie A.; Carwardine, Josie; Grantham, Hedley S.; Watson, James E.

Individuals with an ASD vary greatly in cognitive development, which can range from above average to intellectual disability(2). Although ASDs are known to be highly heritable (similar to 90%)(3), the underlying genetic determinants are still largely unknown. Here we analysed the genome-wide characteristics of rare (<1% frequency) copy number variation in ASD using dense genotyping arrays. When comparing 996 ASD individuals of European ancestry to 1,287 matched controls, cases were found to carry a higher global burden of rare, genic copy number variants (CNVs) (1.19 fold, P=0.012), especially so for loci previously implicated in either ASD and/or intellectual disability (1.69 fold, P=3.4 x 10(-4)). Among the CNVs there were numerous de novo and inherited events, sometimes in combination in a given family, implicating many novel ASD genes such as SHANK2, SYNGAP1, DLGAP2 and the X-linked DDX53-PTCHD1 locus. We also discovered an enrichment of CNVs disrupting functional gene sets involved in cellular proliferation, projection and motility, and GTPase/Ras signalling. Our results reveal many new genetic and functional targets in ASD that may lead to final connected pathways.","[Pinto, Dalila; Carson, Andrew R.; Casallo, Guillermo; Chung, Brian H.

Nonetheless, careful testing shows that certain visually guided behaviours can persist even in the absence of visual awareness(1-4). The neural circuits supporting this phenomenon, which is often termed blindsight, remain uncertain(4). Here we demonstrate that the thalamic lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) has a causal role in V1-independent processing of visual information. By comparing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and behavioural measures with and without temporary LGN inactivation, we assessed the contribution of the LGN to visual functions of macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta) with chronic V1 lesions. Before LGN inactivation, high-contrast stimuli presented to the lesion-affected visual field (scotoma) produced significant V1-independent fMRI activation in the extrastriate cortical areas V2, V3, V4, V5/middle temporal (MT), fundus of the superior temporal sulcus (FST) and lateral intraparietal area (LIP) and the animals correctly located the stimuli in a detection task. However, following reversible inactivation of the LGN in the V1-lesioned hemisphere, fMRI responses and behavioural detection were abolished. These results demonstrate that direct LGN projections to the extrastriate cortex have a critical functional contribution to blindsight. They suggest a viable pathway to mediate fast detection during normal vision.","[Schmid, Michael C.; Mrowka, Sylwia W.; Turchi, Janita; Saunders, Richard C.; Wilke, Melanie; Peters, Andrew J.; Leopold, David A.] NIMH, Neuropsychol Lab, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Ye, Frank Q.; Leopold, David A.] NEI, Neurophysiol Imaging Facil, NIMH, NINDS, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Schmid, MC (reprint author), NIMH, Neuropsychol Lab, 49 Convent Dr, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",schmidmicha@gmail.com,"Schmid, Michael/G-1867-2010","Schmid, Michael/0000-0003-1424-130X; Leopold, David/0000-0002-1345-6360; Peters, Andrew/0000-0001-9351-1456",NIMH; NINDS; NEI,"We thank A.

Establishment of left-right (L-R) asymmetry in development follows the determination of dorsal-ventral and anterior-posterior (A-P) body axes 1,2, although the molecular mechanism underlying precise L-R symmetry breaking in reference to the other two axes is still poorly understood. Here, by removing both Vangl1 and Vangl2, the two mouse homologues of a Drosophila core planar cell polarity (PCP) gene Van Gogh (Vang), we reveal a previously unrecognized function of PCP in the initial breaking of lateral symmetry. The leftward nodal flow across the posterior notochord (PNC) has been identified as the earliest event in the de novo formation of L-R asymmetry(3,4). We show that PCP is essential in interpreting the A-P patterning information and linking it to L-R asymmetry. In the absence of Vangl1 and Vangl2, cilia are positioned randomly around the centre of the PNC cells and nodal flow is turbulent, which results in disrupted L-R asymmetry. PCP in mouse, unlike what has been implicated in other vertebrate species, is not required for ciliogenesis, cilium motility, Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signalling or apical docking of basal bodies in ciliated tracheal epithelial cells. Our data suggest that PCP acts earlier than the unidirectional nodal flow during bilateral symmetry breaking in vertebrates and provide insight into the functional mechanism of PCP in organizing the vertebrate tissues in development.","[Song, Hai; Hu, Jianxin; Chen, Wen; Andre, Philipp; Gao, Bo; Yang, Yingzi] NHGRI, Dev Genet Sect, Genet Dis Res Branch, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Yang, YZ (reprint author), NHGRI, Dev Genet Sect, Genet Dis Res Branch, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",yingzi@mail.nih.gov,,,National Human Genome Research Institute,"We thank members of the Yang laboratory for stimulating discussion; M.

The link between chromatin and ageing has mostly focused on histone deacetylation by the Sir2 family(1,2), but less is known about the role of other histone modifications in longevity. Histone methylation has a crucial role in development and in maintaining stem cell pluripotency in mammals(3). Regulators of histone methylation have been associated with ageing in worms(4-7) and flies(8), but characterization of their role and mechanism of action has been limited. Here we identify the ASH-2 trithorax complex(9), which trimethylates histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4), as a regulator of lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans in a directed RNA interference (RNAi) screen in fertile worms. Deficiencies in members of the ASH-2 complex-ASH-2 itself, WDR-5 and the H3K4 methyltransferase SET-2-extend worm lifespan. Conversely, the H3K4 demethylase RBR-2 is required for normal lifespan, consistent with the idea that an excess of H3K4 trimethylation-a mark associated with active chromatin is detrimental for longevity. Lifespan extension induced by ASH-2 complex deficiency requires the presence of an intact adult germline and the continuous production of mature eggs. ASH-2 and RBR-2 act in the germline, at least in part, to regulate lifespan and to control a set of genes involved in lifespan determination. These results indicate that the longevity of the soma is regulated by an H3K4 methyltransferase/demethylase complex acting in the C. elegans germline.","[Greer, Eric L.; Maures, Travis J.; Hauswirth, Anna G.; Leeman, Dena S.; Han, Shuo; Banko, Max R.; Brunet, Anne] Stanford Univ, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Greer, Eric L.; Leeman, Dena S.; Gozani, Or; Brunet, Anne] Stanford Univ, Canc Biol Grad Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Green, Erin M.; Maro, Geraldine S.; Gozani, Or] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Maro, Geraldine S.] Stanford Univ, Dept Pathol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Brunet, A (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Genet, 300 Pasteur Dr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",anne.brunet@stanford.edu,,"Greer, Eric/0000-0002-7501-7371","NIH [R01-AG31198, T32-CA009302, ARRA-AG31198, T32-HG000044, F31-AG032837]; NSF; Stanford graduate fellowship; Human Frontier Science Program post-doctoral fellowship; Searle Scholar award","We are grateful to A.

Here we report a genome-wide nucleosome positioning analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana using massively parallel sequencing of mononucleosomes. By combining this data with profiles of DNA methylation at single base resolution, we identified 10-base periodicities in the DNA methylation status of nucleosome-bound DNA and found that nucleosomal DNA was more highly methylated than flanking DNA. These results indicate that nucleosome positioning influences DNA methylation patterning throughout the genome and that DNA methyltransferases preferentially target nucleosome-bound DNA. We also observed similar trends in human nucleosomal DNA, indicating that the relationships between nucleosomes and DNA methyltransferases are conserved. Finally, as has been observed in animals, nucleosomes were highly enriched on exons, and preferentially positioned at intron-exon and exon-intron boundaries. RNA polymerase II (Pol II) was also enriched on exons relative to introns, consistent with the hypothesis that nucleosome positioning regulates Pol II processivity. DNA methylation is also enriched on exons, consistent with the targeting of DNA methylation to nucleosomes, and suggesting a role for DNA methylation in exon definition.","[Chodavarapu, Ramakrishna K.; Feng, Suhua; Bernatavichute, Yana V.; Chen, Pao-Yang; Stroud, Hume; Hetzel, Jonathan A.; Kuo, Frank; Kim, Jin; Cokus, Shawn J.; Casero, David; Clark, Amander T.; Jacobsen, Steven E.; Pellegrini, Matteo] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Mol Cell & Dev Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Feng, Suhua; Jacobsen, Steven E.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Bernatavichute, Yana V.; Merchant, Sabeeha S.; Jacobsen, Steven E.; Pellegrini, Matteo] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Mol Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Yu, Yanchun; Zhang, Xiaoyu] Univ Georgia, Dept Plant Biol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Bernal, Maria; Kraemer, Ute] Univ Heidelberg, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Huijser, Peter] Max Planck Inst Plant Breeding Res, Dept Mol Plant Genet, D-50829 Cologne, Germany; [Clark, Amander T.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Eli & Edythe Broad Ctr Regenerat Med & Stem Cell, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Merchant, Sabeeha S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Chem & Biochem, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Jacobsen, SE (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Mol Cell & Dev Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",jacobsen@ucla.edu; matteop@mcdb.ucla.edu,"Kraemer, Ute/C-5025-2008; Casero, David/E-7365-2010","Kraemer, Ute/0000-0001-7870-4508; Casero, David/0000-0002-7347-3330","Department of Energy, Institute for Genomics and Proteomics; NIH [GM07104, GM60398, GM42143]; Eli & Edythe Broad Center of Regenerative Medicine & Stem Cell Research at UCLA; Alexander-von-Humboldt Fellowship; Heisenberg Fellowship; University of Georgia [JR-040]; NSF [0701745]","We thank members of our laboratories for input and guidance, and the Department of Energy, Institute for Genomics and Proteomics for support.

This group of channels can be activated synergistically by both voltage and intracellular Ca2+, with the large carboxy-terminal intracellular portion being responsible for Ca2+ sensing(5-13). Here we present the crystal structure of the entire cytoplasmic region of the human BK channel in a Ca2+-free state. The structure reveals four intracellular subunits, each comprising two tandem RCK domains, assembled into a gating ring similar to that seen in the MthK channel 14 and probably representing its physiological assembly. Three Ca2+ binding sites including the Ca2+ bowl are mapped onto the structure based on mutagenesis data. The Ca2+ bowl, located within the second RCK domain, forms an EF-hand-like motif and is strategically positioned close to the assembly interface between two subunits. The other two Ca2+ (or Mg2+) binding sites, Asp 367 and Glu 374/Glu 399, are located on the first RCK domain. The Asp 367 site has high Ca2+ sensitivity and is positioned in the groove between the amino-and carboxyterminal subdomains of RCK1, whereas the low-affinity Mg2+-binding Glu 374/Glu 399 site is positioned on the upper plateau of the gating ring and close to the membrane. Our structure also contains the linker connecting the transmembrane and intracellular domains, allowing us to dock a voltage-gated K+ channel pore of known structure onto the gating ring with reasonable accuracy and generate a structural model for the full BK channel.","[Wu, Yunkun; Yang, Yi; Jiang, Youxing] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Physiol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Wu, Yunkun; Jiang, Youxing] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Ye, Sheng] Zhejiang Univ, Inst Life Sci, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China","Jiang, YX (reprint author), Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Physiol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA.",youxing.jiang@utsouthwestern.edu,,,Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NIH/NIGMS [RO1 GM071621]; Welch Foundation,"We thank A.

Here we report that microRNA-212 (miR-212) is upregulated in the dorsal striatum of rats with a history of extended access to cocaine. Striatal miR-212 decreases responsiveness to the motivational properties of cocaine by markedly amplifying the stimulatory effects of the drug on cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) signalling. This action occurs through miR-212-enhanced Raf1 activity, resulting in adenylyl cyclase sensitization and increased expression of the essential CREB co-activator TORC (transducer of regulated CREB; also known as CRTC). Our findings indicate that striatal miR-212 signalling has a key role in determining vulnerability to cocaine addiction, reveal new molecular regulators that control the complex actions of cocaine in brain reward circuitries and provide an entirely new direction for the development of anti-addiction therapeutics based on the modulation of noncoding RNAs.","[Hollander, Jonathan A.; Im, Heh-In; Bali, Purva; Lu, Qun; Kenny, Paul J.] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol Therapeut, Lab Behav & Mol Neurosci, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA; [Amelio, Antonio L.; Conkright, Michael D.] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Canc Biol, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA; [Kocerha, Jannet; Wahlestedt, Claes] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Neurosci, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA; [Kocerha, Jannet; Wahlestedt, Claes] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol Therapeut, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA; [Willoughby, David] Ocean Ridge Biosci, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410 USA","Kenny, PJ (reprint author), Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol Therapeut, Lab Behav & Mol Neurosci, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA.",pjkenny@scripps.edu,,,National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA),"This work was supported by a grant from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) to P.J.K. and C.W., and NIDA post-doctoral awards to J.A.H. and H.-I.I.

Here we report the crystal structure of the Streptomyces lividans K+ channel KcsA in its open-inactivated conformation and investigate the mechanism of C-type inactivation gating at the selectivity filter from channels 'trapped' in a series of partially open conformations. Five conformer classes were identified with openings ranging from 12 angstrom in closed KcsA (C alpha-C alpha distances at Thr 112) to 32 angstrom when fully open. They revealed a remarkable correlation between the degree of gate opening and the conformation and ion occupancy of the selectivity filter. We show that a gradual filter backbone reorientation leads first to a loss of the S2 ion binding site and a subsequent loss of the S3 binding site, presumably abrogating ion conduction.

Ultraluminous X-ray sources 1 are the most luminous class of black hole (L(X) approximate to 10(40) erg s(-1)) located outside the nuclei of active galaxies. They are likely to be accreting at super-Eddington rates, if they are powered by black holes with masses less than 100 solar masses. They are often associated with shock-ionized nebulae 2,3, though with no evidence of collimated jets. Microquasars with steady jets are much less luminous. Here we report that the large nebula S26 (ref. 4) in the nearby galaxy NGC 7793 is powered by a black hole with a pair of collimated jets. It is similar to the famous Galactic source SS433 (ref. 5), but twice as large and a few times more powerful. We determine a mechanical power of around a few 10(40) erg s(-1). The jets therefore seem 10(4) times more energetic than the X-ray emission from the core. S26 has the structure of a Fanaroff-Riley type II (FRII-type) active galaxy: X-ray and optical core, X-ray hot spots, radio lobes 6 and an optical and X-ray cocoon. It is a microquasar where most of the jet power is dissipated in thermal particles in the lobes rather than relativistic electrons.","[Pakull, Manfred W.; Motch, Christian] Univ Strasbourg, CNRS, UMR 7550, Astron Observ, F-67000 Strasbourg, France; [Soria, Roberto] Univ Coll London, MSSL, Holmbury RH5 6NT, Surrey, England","Pakull, MW (reprint author), Univ Strasbourg, CNRS, UMR 7550, Astron Observ, 11 Rue Univ, F-67000 Strasbourg, France.",manfred.pakull@astro.unistra.fr; rsoria@physics.usyd.edu.au,,,Early-Career Leverhulme Fellowship,"This work was based on observations made with ESO telescopes at the Paranal Observatory under program 084.D-0881 (M.

The root-meansquare charge radius, r(p), has been determined with an accuracy of 2 per cent (at best) by electron-proton scattering experiments(1,2). The present most accurate value of r(p) (with an uncertainty of 1 per cent) is given by the CODATA compilation of physical constants(3). This value is based mainly on precision spectroscopy of atomic hydrogen(4-7) and calculations of bound-state quantum electrodynamics (QED; refs 8, 9). The accuracy of r(p) as deduced from electron-proton scattering limits the testing of bound-state QED in atomic hydrogen as well as the determination of the Rydberg constant (currently the most accurately measured fundamental physical constant 3). An attractive means to improve the accuracy in the measurement of r(p) is provided by muonic hydrogen (a proton orbited by a negative muon); its much smaller Bohr radius compared to ordinary atomic hydrogen causes enhancement of effects related to the finite size of the proton. In particular, the Lamb shift 10 (the energy difference between the 2S(1/2) and 2P(1/2) states) is affected by as much as 2 per cent. Here we use pulsed laser spectroscopy to measure a muonic Lamb shift of 49,881.88(76) GHz. On the basis of present calculations(11-15) of fine and hyperfine splittings and QED terms, we find r(p) = 0.84184(67) fm, which differs by 5.0 standard deviations from the CODATA value(3) of 0.8768(69) fm. Our result implies that either the Rydberg constant has to be shifted by 2110 kHz/c (4.9 standard deviations), or the calculations of the QED effects in atomic hydrogen or muonic hydrogen atoms are insufficient.","[Pohl, Randolf; Antognini, Aldo; Haensch, Theodor W.; Nebel, Tobias] Max Planck Inst Quantum Opt, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Nez, Francois; Biraben, Francois; Indelicato, Paul; Julien, Lucile; Le Bigot, Eric-Olivier; Schwob, Catherine] Ecole Normale Super, CNRS, Lab Kastler Brossel, F-75252 Paris 05, France; [Nez, Francois; Biraben, Francois; Indelicato, Paul; Julien, Lucile; Le Bigot, Eric-Olivier; Schwob, Catherine] Univ Paris 06, F-75252 Paris 05, France; [Amaro, Fernando D.; Cardoso, Joao M.

Generation of polarization entangled photon pairs can be obtained through parametric conversion in nonlinear optical media(5-7) or by making use of the radiative decay of two electron-hole pairs trapped in a semiconductor quantum dot(8-11). Today, these sources operate at a very low rate, below 0.01 photon pairs per excitation pulse, which strongly limits their applications. For systems based on parametric conversion, this low rate is intrinsically due to the Poissonian statistics of the source(12). Conversely, a quantum dot can emit a single pair of entangled photons with a probability near unity but suffers from a naturally very low extraction efficiency. Here we show that this drawback can be overcome by coupling an optical cavity in the formof a 'photonic molecule'(13) to a single quantum dot. Two coupled identical pillars-the photonic molecule-were etched in a semiconductor planar microcavity, using an optical lithography method(14) that ensures a deterministic coupling to the biexciton and exciton energy states of a pre-selected quantum dot. The Purcell effect ensures that most entangled photon pairs are emitted into two cavity modes, while improving the indistinguishability of the two optical recombination paths(15,16). A polarization entangled photon pair rate of 0.12 per excitation pulse (with a concurrence of 0.34) is collected in the first lens. Our results open the way towards the fabrication of solid state triggered sources of entangled photon pairs, with an overall (creation and collection) efficiency of 80%.","[Dousse, Adrien; Suffczynski, Jan; Beveratos, Alexios; Krebs, Olivier; Lemaitre, Aristide; Sagnes, Isabelle; Bloch, Jacqueline; Voisin, Paul; Senellart, Pascale] CNRS, Lab Photon & Nanostruct, F-91460 Marcoussis, France","Senellart, P (reprint author), CNRS, Lab Photon & Nanostruct, Route Nozay, F-91460 Marcoussis, France.",Pascale.Senellart@lpn.cnrs.fr,"Lemaitre, Aristide/B-9899-2009; Suffczynski@fuw.edu.pl, Jan/L-3751-2014; SENELLART, Pascale/C-1771-2017; Bloch, Jacqueline/S-2062-2017","Lemaitre, Aristide/0000-0003-1892-9726; Suffczynski@fuw.edu.pl, Jan/0000-0003-3737-464X; SENELLART, Pascale/0000-0002-8727-1086; Bloch, Jacqueline/0000-0001-7823-8420",European Project NanoEPR; French ANR [P3N],"This work was partly supported by the European Project NanoEPR and by the French ANR P3N DELIGHT.

In the high-temperature superconducting copper oxides, only one spatial arrangement of the electronically active Cu2+ units-a two-dimensional square lattice-is available to study the competition between the cooperative electronic states of magnetic order and superconductivity(1). Crystals of the spherical molecular C-60(3-) anion support both superconductivity and magnetism but can consist of fundamentally distinct three-dimensional arrangements of the anions. Superconductivity in the A(3)C(60) (A = alkali metal) fullerides has been exclusively associated with face-centred cubic (f.c.c.) packing of C-60(3-) (refs 2, 3), but recently the most expanded (and thus having the highest superconducting transition temperature, T-o ref. 4) composition Cs3C60 has been isolated as a body-centred cubic (b.c.c.) packing, which supports both superconductivity and magnetic order(5,6). Here we isolate the f.c.c. polymorph of Cs3C60 to show how the spatial arrangement of the electronically active units controls the competing superconducting and magnetic electronic ground states. Unlike all the other f.c.c. A(3)C(60) fullerides, f.c.c. Cs3C60 is not a superconductor but a magnetic insulator at ambient pressure, and becomes superconducting under pressure. The magnetic ordering occurs at an order of magnitude lower temperature in the geometrically frustrated f.c.c. polymorph (Neel temperature T-N = 2.2 K) than in the b.c.c.-based packing (T-N = 46 K). The different lattice packings of C-60(3-) change T-c from 38 K in b.c.c. Cs3C60 to 35 K in f.c.c. Cs3C60 (the highest found in the f.c.c. A(3)C(60) family). The existence of two superconducting packings of the same electronically active unit reveals that T-c scales universally in a structure-independent dome-like relationship with proximity to the Mott metal-insulator transition, which is governed by the role of electron correlations characteristic of high-temperature superconducting materials other than fullerides.","[Ganin, Alexey Y.; McLennan, Alec; Darling, George R.; Rosseinsky, Matthew J.] Univ Liverpool, Dept Chem, Liverpool L69 7ZD, Merseyside, England; [Takabayashi, Yasuhiro; McDonald, Martin T.; Tzirakis, Manolis D.; Prassides, Kosmas] Univ Durham, Dept Chem, Durham DH1 3LE, England; [Jeglic, Peter; Arcon, Denis; Potocnik, Anton] Jozef Stefan Inst, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia; [Arcon, Denis] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Math & Phys, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia; [Baker, Peter J.] STFC Rutherford Appleton Lab, ISIS Pulsed Neutron & Muon Source, Didcot OX11 0QX, Oxon, England; [Ohishi, Yasuo; Takata, Masaki] Japan Synchrotron Radiat Res Inst, SPring 8, Hyogo 6795198, Japan; [Takata, Masaki] RIKEN, Ctr SPring 8, Mikazuki, Hyogo 6795148, Japan","Rosseinsky, MJ (reprint author), Univ Liverpool, Dept Chem, Liverpool L69 7ZD, Merseyside, England.",M.J.Rosseinsky@liverpool.ac.uk; K.Prassides@durham.ac.uk,"; Baker, Peter/E-4216-2010; Takabayashi, Yasuhiro/A-5014-2013; Takata, Masaki/M-1525-2014; Tzirakis, Manolis/N-5429-2014; Prassides, Kosmas/C-9804-2009; Potocnik, Anton/P-3793-2017","Ganin, Alexey/0000-0002-3754-5819; Baker, Peter/0000-0002-2306-2648; Takabayashi, Yasuhiro/0000-0002-3493-2194; Tzirakis, Manolis/0000-0002-8591-2038; Prassides, Kosmas/0000-0003-4524-3084; Potocnik, Anton/0000-0002-0352-6388","EPSRC [EP/G037132, EP/G037949]",We thank EPSRC for support (EP/G037132 and EP/G037949) and STFC for access to the synchrotron X-ray facilities at the ESRF (where we thank A.

Emissions of African dust increased sharply in the early 1970s (ref. 2), a change that has been attributed mainly to drought in the Sahara/Sahel region(2) caused by changes in the global distribution of sea surface temperature(3,4). The human contribution to land degradation and dust mobilization in this region remains poorly understood(5-11), owing to the paucity of data that would allow the identification of long-term trends in desertification(12). Direct measurements of airborne African dust concentrations only became available in the mid-1960s from a station on Barbados(2) and subsequently from satellite imagery since the late 1970s: they do not cover the onset of commercial agriculture in the Sahel region similar to 170 years ago(11,13,14). Here we construct a 3,200-year record of dust deposition off northwest Africa by investigating the chemistry and grain-size distribution of terrigenous sediments deposited at a marine site located directly under the West African dust plume. With the help of our dust record and a proxy record for West African precipitation(15) we find that, on the century scale, dust deposition is related to precipitation in tropical West Africa until the seventeenth century. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, a sharp increase in dust deposition parallels the advent of commercial agriculture in the Sahel region. Our findings suggest that human-induced dust emissions from the Sahel region have contributed to the atmospheric dust load for about 200 years.","[Mulitza, Stefan; Heslop, David; Meyer, Inka; Stuut, Jan-Berend; Zabel, Matthias; Mollenhauer, Gesine; Collins, James A.; Kuhnert, Henning; Schulz, Michael] Univ Bremen, Ctr Marine Environm Sci, MARUM, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Pittauerova, Daniela; Fischer, Helmut W.] Univ Bremen, Inst Environm Phys, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Stuut, Jan-Berend] Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Texel, Netherlands; [Mollenhauer, Gesine] Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, D-27515 Bremerhaven, Germany","Mulitza, S (reprint author), Univ Bremen, Ctr Marine Environm Sci, MARUM, Leobener Str, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.",smulitza@uni-bremen.de,"; Zabel, Matthias/E-5044-2011; Mulitza, Stefan/G-5357-2011; Heslop, David/G-6412-2011; Fischer, Helmut/K-6207-2012; Mollenhauer, Gesine/B-5190-2015; Meyer, Inka/C-7117-2016; Schulz, Michael/P-7276-2016; Pittauer, Daniela/G-8854-2014; Stuut, Jan-Berend/K-2073-2013","Kuhnert, Henning/0000-0001-5242-4495; Zabel, Matthias/0000-0003-4681-1821; Mulitza, Stefan/0000-0002-3842-1447; Heslop, David/0000-0001-8245-0555; Fischer, Helmut/0000-0002-0593-5564; Mollenhauer, Gesine/0000-0001-5138-564X; Meyer, Inka/0000-0001-6219-2237; Schulz, Michael/0000-0001-6500-2697; Pittauer, Daniela/0000-0002-3643-333X; Stuut, Jan-Berend/0000-0002-5348-2512",DFG Research Center/Cluster of Excellence,"Radiocarbon datings were performed at the Leibniz-Laboratory for Radiometric Dating and Stable Isotope Research in Kiel and at the Poznan Radiocarbon Laboratory.

This range encompassed tropical forest, savannah and Mediterranean habitats, but has hitherto not been demonstrated beyond 45 degrees N. Until recently, early colonization in Europe was thought to be confined to the area south of the Pyrenees and Alps. However, evidence from Pakefield (Suffolk, UK) at similar to 0.7 Myrindicated that humans occupied northern European latitudes when a Mediterranean-type climate prevailed(6). This provided the basis for an 'ebb and flow' model, where human populations were thought to survive in southern refugia during cold stages, only expanding northwards during fully temperate climates(5). Here we present new evidence from Happisburgh (Norfolk, UK) demonstrating that Early Pleistocene hominins were present in northern Europe >0.78 Myr ago when they were able to survive at the southern edge of the boreal zone. This has significant implications for our understanding of early human behaviour, adaptation and survival, as well as the tempo and mode of colonization after their first dispersal out of Africa.","[Ashton, Nick M.] British Museum, Dept Prehistory & Europe, London N1 5QJ, England; [Parfitt, Simon A.] UCL, Inst Archaeol, London WC1H 0PY, England; [Parfitt, Simon A.; Lewis, Mark D.; Peglar, Sylvia M.; Whittaker, John E.; Stringer, Chris B.] Nat Hist Museum, Dept Palaeontol, London SW7 5BD, England; [Lewis, Simon G.] Queen Mary Univ London, Dept Geog, London E1 4NS, England; [Abel, Richard L.] Nat Hist Museum, Dept Mineral, London SW7 5BD, England; [Field, Mike H.] Leiden Univ, Dept Archaeol, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands; [Coope, G.

One early morphological divergence between pectoral fins and limbs is in the fate of the apical ectodermal ridge (AER), the distal epidermis that rims the bud. Whereas the AER of tetrapods regresses after specification of the skeletal progenitors(3), the AER of teleost fishes forms a fold that elongates(4,5). Formation of the fin fold is accompanied by the synthesis of two rows of rigid, unmineralized fibrils called actinotrichia, which keep the fold straight(6,7) and guide the migration of mesenchymal cells within the fold(5,8). The actinotrichia are made of elastoidin, the components of which, apart from collagen, are unknown. Here we show that two zebrafish proteins, which we name actinodin 1 and 2 (And1 and And2), are essential structural components of elastoidin. The presence of actinodin sequences in several teleost fishes and in the elephant shark (Callorhinchus milii, which occupies a basal phylogenetic position), but not in tetrapods, suggests that these genes have been lost during tetrapod species evolution. Double gene knockdown of and1 and and2 in zebrafish embryos results in the absence of actinotrichia and impaired fin folds. Gene expression profiles in embryos lacking and1 and and2 function are consistent with pectoral fin truncation and may offer a potential explanation for the polydactyly observed in early tetrapod fossils. We propose that the loss of both actinodins and actinotrichia during evolution may have led to the loss of lepidotrichia and may have contributed to the fin-to-limb transition.","[Zhang, Jing; Wagh, Purva; Guay, Danielle; Akimenko, Marie-Andree] Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, CAREG, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Sanchez-Pulido, Luis] Univ Oxford, Funct Genom Unit, Dept Physiol Anat & Genet, Oxford OX1 3QX, England; [Padhi, Bhaja K.] Hlth Canada, Environm Hlth Sci & Res Bur, Ottawa, ON K1A 0L2, Canada; [Korzh, Vladimir] Inst Mol & Cell Biol, Singapore 138673, Singapore; [Andrade-Navarro, Miguel A.] Max Delbruck Ctr Mol Med, D-13125 Berlin, Germany","Akimenko, MA (reprint author), Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, CAREG, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",makimen@uottawa.ca,"ASTAR, IMCB/E-2320-2012; Andrade, Miguel/B-6565-2008; Korzh, Vladimir/H-1596-2011","Andrade, Miguel/0000-0001-6650-1711; Korzh, Vladimir/0000-0002-6580-7986; Sanchez Pulido, Luis/0000-0002-2300-8502","European Modular Biology Organization [ALT 325-2008]; Natural Science Engineering and Research Council of Canada; Canadian Institutes of Health Research; Canada Research Chairs; Helmholtz Alliance on Systems Biology; Agency for Science, Technology and Research of Singapore","The authors would like to thank I.

Historical evidence suggests common origins in the Middle East, followed by migrations leading to the establishment of communities of Jews in Europe, Africa and Asia, in what is termed the Jewish Diaspora(3-5). This complex demographic history imposes special challenges in attempting to address the genetic structure of the Jewish people(6). Although many genetic studies have shed light on Jewish origins and on diseases prevalent among Jewish communities, including studies focusing on uniparentally and biparentally inherited markers(7-16), genome-wide patterns of variation across the vast geographic span of Jewish Diaspora communities and their respective neighbours have yet to be addressed. Here we use high-density bead arrays to genotype individuals from 14 Jewish Diaspora communities and compare these patterns of genome-wide diversity with those from 69 Old World non-Jewish populations, of which 25 have not previously been reported. These samples were carefully chosen to provide comprehensive comparisons between Jewish and non-Jewish populations in the Diaspora, as well as with non-Jewish populations from the Middle East and north Africa. Principal component and structure-like analyses identify previously unrecognized genetic substructure within the Middle East. Most Jewish samples form a remarkably tight subcluster that overlies Druze and Cypriot samples but not samples from other Levantine populations or paired Diaspora host populations. In contrast, Ethiopian Jews (Beta Israel) and Indian Jews (Bene Israel and Cochini) cluster with neighbouring autochthonous populations in Ethiopia and western India, respectively, despite a clear paternal link between the Bene Israel and the Levant. These results cast light on the variegated genetic architecture of the Middle East, and trace the origins of most Jewish Diaspora communities to the Levant.","[Behar, Doron M.; Yudkovsky, Guennady; Skorecki, Karl] Mol Med Lab, IL-31096 Haifa, Israel; [Behar, Doron M.; Yunusbayev, Bayazit; Metspalu, Mait; Metspalu, Ene; Parik, Jueri; Rootsi, Siiri; Chaubey, Gyaneshwer; Kutuev, Ildus; Villems, Richard] Univ Tartu, Estonian Bioctr, EE-51010 Tartu, Estonia; [Behar, Doron M.; Yunusbayev, Bayazit; Metspalu, Mait; Metspalu, Ene; Parik, Jueri; Rootsi, Siiri; Chaubey, Gyaneshwer; Kutuev, Ildus; Villems, Richard] Univ Tartu, Dept Evolutionary Biol, EE-51010 Tartu, Estonia; [Yunusbayev, Bayazit; Kutuev, Ildus; Khusnutdinova, Elza K.] Russian Acad Sci, Ufa Res Ctr, Inst Biochem & Genet, Ufa 450054, Russia; [Rosset, Saharon] Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Math Sci, Dept Stat & Operat Res, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Yudkovsky, Guennady; Skorecki, Karl] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Rappaport Fac Med & Res Inst, IL-31096 Haifa, Israel; [Balanovsky, Oleg] Russian Acad Med Sci, Med Genet Res Ctr, Moscow 115478, Russia; [Semino, Ornella] Univ Pavia, Dipartimento Genet & Microbiol, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [Pereira, Luisa] IPATIMUP, P-4200465 Oporto, Portugal; [Pereira, Luisa] Univ Porto, Fac Med, P-4200319 Oporto, Portugal; [Comas, David] CEXS UPF PRBB, Inst Evolutionary Biol, CSIC, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Comas, David] CIBER Epidemiol & Salud Publ, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Gurwitz, David; Bonne-Tamir, Batsheva] Tel Aviv Univ, Sackler Fac Med, Dept Human Mol Genet & Biochem, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Parfitt, Tudor] Univ London Sch Oriental & African Studies, Fac Languages & Cultures, Dept Languages & Cultures Near & Middle E, London WC1H 0XG, England; [Hammer, Michael F.] Univ Arizona, ARL Div Biotechnol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","Behar, DM (reprint author), Mol Med Lab, Rambam Hlth Care Campus, IL-31096 Haifa, Israel.",behardm@usernet.com; skorecki@tx.technion.ac.il; rvillems@ebc.ee,"Chaubey, Gyaneshwer/H-2753-2012; Gurwitz, David/E-7642-2013; Pereira, Luisa /H-3050-2011; Comas, David/D-5382-2014; Balanovsky, Oleg/G-1549-2014; Metspalu, Mait/G-8671-2015; Khusnutdinova, Elza/A-4810-2013","Chaubey, Gyaneshwer/0000-0003-2899-3852; Gurwitz, David/0000-0002-9363-1869; Pereira, Luisa /0000-0002-4271-1527; Comas, David/0000-0002-5075-0956; Metspalu, Mait/0000-0003-3099-9161; Khusnutdinova, Elza/0000-0003-2987-3334; SEMINO, Ornella/0000-0002-9675-9403","European Commission [205419]; European Union through a Centre of Excellence in Genomics; Swedish Collegium for Advanced Studies; Estonian Science Foundation [7858, 7445]; Arthur and Rosalinde Gilbert Foundation; American Technion Society; European Union for Marie Curie International Reintegration [CT-2007-208019]; Israeli Science Foundation [1227/09]; Associate Laboratory of the Portuguese Ministry of Science, Technology and Higher Education; Fundacao para a Ciencia ea Tecnologia; Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology","We thank the individuals who provided DNA samples for this study, including the National Laboratory for the Genetics of Israeli Populations; Mari Nelis, Georgi Hudjashov and Viljo Soo for conducting the autosomal genotyping; Lauri Anton for computational help.

Functionally defective SIAE rare and polymorphic variants represent a strong genetic link to susceptibility in relatively common human autoimmune disorders.","[Surolia, Ira; Pirnie, Stephan P.; Chellappa, Vasant; Taylor, Kendra N.; Cariappa, Annaiah; Moya, Jesse; Liu, Haoyuan; Bell, Daphne W.; Driscoll, David R.; Diederichs, Sven; Haider, Khaleda; Netravali, Ilka; Le, Sheila; Elia, Roberto; Dow, Ethan; Pillai, Shiv] Harvard Univ, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Sch Med, Ctr Canc, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Lee, Annette; Freudenberg, Jan; Gregersen, Peter K.] N Shore LIJ Hlth Syst, Feinstein Inst Med Res, Manhasset, NY 11030 USA; [De Jager, Philip L.; Hafler, David] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Ctr Neurol Dis, Div Mol Immunol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [De Jager, Philip L.; Hafler, David] Partners Ctr Personalized Genet Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [De Jager, Philip L.; Hafler, David] Harvard Univ, Broad Inst, Program Med & Populat Genet, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [De Jager, Philip L.; Hafler, David] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Chretien, Yves] Harvard Univ, Dept Stat, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Varki, Ajit] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Varki, Ajit] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Cellular & Mol Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [MacDonald, Marcy E.; Gillis, Tammy] Harvard Univ, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Sch Med, Ctr Human Genet Res, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Behrens, Timothy W.] Genentech Inc, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Bloch, Donald; Collier, Deborah; Stone, John H.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Div Rheumatol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Korzenik, Joshua; Podolsky, Daniel K.; Sands, Bruce] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Gastrointestinal Unit, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Murali, Mandakolathur] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Clin Immunol Lab, Boston, MA 02114 USA","Pillai, S (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Sch Med, Ctr Canc, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",pillai@helix.mgh.harvard.edu,"Diederichs, Sven/J-6237-2012","Diederichs, Sven/0000-0001-7901-4752; Bloch, Donald/0000-0002-6828-4754","Alliance for Lupus Research; Center for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease at MGH; NIH [AI 064930, AI 076505, AR 058481, NS 32765]; NIH for NARAC [AR 044422, AR 022263]; MADGC [AI 068759]","We thank M.

Here, we used tissue ablation in the chicken embryo to demonstrate that the caudal presomitic mesoderm (PSM) has a key role in axis elongation. Using time-lapse microscopy, we analysed the movements of fluorescently labelled cells in the PSM during embryo elongation, which revealed a clear posterior-to-anterior gradient of cell motility and directionality in the PSM. We tracked the movement of the PSM extracellular matrix in parallel with the labelled cells and subtracted the extracellular matrix movement from the global motion of cells. After subtraction, cell motility remained graded but lacked directionality, indicating that the posterior cell movements associated with axis elongation in the PSM are not intrinsic but reflect tissue deformation. The gradient of cell motion along the PSM parallels the fibroblast growth factor (FGF)/mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) gradient(1), which has been implicated in the control of cell motility in this tissue(2). Both FGF signalling gain-and loss-of-function experiments lead to disruption of the motility gradient and a slowing down of axis elongation. Furthermore, embryos treated with cell movement inhibitors (blebbistatin or RhoK inhibitor), but not cell cycle inhibitors, show a slower axis elongation rate. We propose that the gradient of random cell motility downstream of FGF signalling in the PSM controls posterior elongation in the amniote embryo. Our data indicate that tissue elongation is an emergent property that arises from the collective regulation of graded, random cell motion rather than by the regulation of directionality of individual cellular movements.","[Benazeraf, Bertrand; Pourquie, Olivier] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; [Benazeraf, Bertrand; Denans, Nicolas; Pourquie, Olivier] Stowers Inst Med Res, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; [Benazeraf, Bertrand; Denans, Nicolas; Pourquie, Olivier] Univ Strasbourg, CNRS, INSERM, IGBMC,UMR 7104,U964, F-67400 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France; [Francois, Paul] Rockefeller Univ, Ctr Studies Phys & Biol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Baker, Ruth E.] Univ Oxford, Math Inst, Ctr Math Biol, Oxford OX1 3LB, England; [Little, Charles D.; Pourquie, Olivier] Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Dept Anat & Cell Biol, Kansas City, KS 66160 USA","Pourquie, O (reprint author), Howard Hughes Med Inst, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA.",pourquie@igbmc.fr,"Francois, Paul/G-5673-2010","denans, nicolas/0000-0002-1875-0841; Pourquie, Olivier/0000-0001-5189-1227",Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Stowers Institute for Medical Research; NIH [R02 HD043158]; Chaire d'excellence; NSF [DMR-0129848]; Lavoisier Fellowship; RCUK Fellowship in Mathematical Biology; Microsoft European Postdoctoral Research Fellowship; Mathers Charitable Foundation,"The authors thank R.

In mammals, tissue-and cell type-specific methylation is present in a small percentage of 5' CpG island (CGI) promoters, whereas a far greater proportion occurs across gene bodies, coinciding with highly conserved sequences(5-10). Tissue-specific intragenic methylation might reduce(3), or, paradoxically, enhance transcription elongation efficiency(1,2,4,5). Capped analysis of gene expression (CAGE) experiments also indicate that transcription commonly initiates within and between genes(11-15). To investigate the role of intragenic methylation, we generated a map of DNA methylation from the human brain encompassing 24.7 million of the 28 million CpG sites. From the dense, high-resolution coverage of CpG islands, the majority of methylated CpG islands were shown to be in intragenic and intergenic regions, whereas less than 3% of CpG islands in 59 promoters were methylated. The CpG islands in all three locations overlapped with RNA markers of transcription initiation, and unmethylated CpG islands also overlapped significantly with trimethylation of H3K4, a histone modification enriched at promoters 16. The general and CpG-island-specific patterns of methylation are conserved in mouse tissues. An in-depth investigation of the human SHANK3 locus(17,18) and its mouse homologue demonstrated that this tissue-specific DNA methylation regulates intragenic promoter activity in vitro and in vivo. These methylation-regulated, alternative transcripts are expressed in a tissue-and cell type-specific manner, and are expressed differentially within a single cell type from distinct brain regions. These results support a major role for intragenic methylation in regulating cell context-specific alternative promoters in gene bodies.","[Ballinger, Tracy J.; Haussler, David; Wang, Ting] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ctr Biomol Sci & Engn, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Maunakea, Alika K.; Nagarajan, Raman P.; Fouse, Shaun D.; Johnson, Brett E.; Hong, Chibo; Costello, Joseph F.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Helen Diller Family Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dept Neurosurg, Brain Tumor Res Ctr, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Bilenky, Mikhail; D'Souza, Cletus; Nielsen, Cydney; Zhao, Yongjun; Delaney, Allen; Varhol, Richard; Thiessen, Nina; Jones, Steven J.

Knowledge concerning the types of protein modules that can interact with acetyl-lysine has so far been limited to bromodomains(1). Recently, a tandem plant homeodomain (PHD) finger(3) (PHD1-PHD2, or PHD12) of human DPF3b, which functions in association with the BAF chromatin remodelling complex to initiate gene transcription during heart and muscle development, was reported to bind histones H3 and H4 in an acetylation-sensitive manner(4), making it the first alternative to bromodomains for acetyl-lysine binding(5). Here we report the structural mechanism of acetylated histone binding by the double PHD fingers of DPF3b. Our three-dimensional solution structures and biochemical analysis of DPF3b highlight the molecular basis of the integrated tandem PHD finger, which acts as one functional unit in the sequence-specific recognition of lysine-14-acetylated histone H3 (H3K14ac). Whereas the interaction with H3 is promoted by acetylation at lysine 14, it is inhibited by methylation at lysine 4, and these opposing influences are important during transcriptional activation of the mouse DPF3b target genes Pitx2 and Jmjd1c. Binding of this tandem protein module to chromatin can thus be regulated by different histone modifications during the initiation of gene transcription.","[Zeng, Lei; Zhang, Qiang; Plotnikov, Alexander N.; Walsh, Martin J.; Zhou, Ming-Ming] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Struct & Chem Biol, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Li, Side; Walsh, Martin J.] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Paediat, New York, NY 10029 USA","Zhou, MM (reprint author), Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Struct & Chem Biol, 1425 Madison Ave,Box 1677, New York, NY 10029 USA.",ming-ming.zhou@mssm.edu,,,National Institutes of Health,"We acknowledge the use of the NMR Facility at the New York Structural Biology Center.

However, limited understanding of force transmission within sub-cellular structures is a major obstacle to unravelling molecular mechanisms. Here we describe the development of a calibrated biosensor that measures forces across specific proteins in cells with piconewton (pN) sensitivity, as demonstrated by single molecule fluorescence force spectroscopy(2). The method is applied to vinculin, a protein that connects integrins to actin filaments and whose recruitment to focal adhesions (FAs) is force-dependent(3). We show that tension across vinculin in stable FAs is similar to 2.5 pN and that vinculin recruitment to FAs and force transmission across vinculin are regulated separately. Highest tension across vinculin is associated with adhesion assembly and enlargement. Conversely, vinculin is under low force in disassembling or sliding FAs at the trailing edge of migrating cells. Furthermore, vinculin is required for stabilizing adhesions under force. Together, these data reveal that FA stabilization under force requires both vinculin recruitment and force transmission, and that, surprisingly, these processes can be controlled independently.","[Grashoff, Carsten; Hoffman, Brenton D.; Schwartz, Martin A.] Univ Virginia, Robert M Berne Cardiovasc Res Ctr, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Grashoff, Carsten; Hoffman, Brenton D.; Schwartz, Martin A.] Univ Virginia, Dept Microbiol, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Brenner, Michael D.; Zhou, Ruobo; Ha, Taekjip] Univ Illinois, Ctr Phys Living Cells, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Brenner, Michael D.; Zhou, Ruobo; Ha, Taekjip] Univ Illinois, Dept Phys, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Brenner, Michael D.; Ha, Taekjip] Univ Illinois, Dept Chem, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Parsons, Maddy] Kings Coll London, Randall Div Cell & Mol Biophys, London SE1 1UL, England; [Yang, Michael T.; Chen, Christopher S.] Univ Penn, Dept Bioengn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [McLean, Mark A.; Sligar, Stephen G.] Univ Illinois, Dept Biochem, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Ha, Taekjip] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Schwartz, Martin A.] Univ Virginia, Dept Biomed Engn, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA","Schwartz, MA (reprint author), Univ Virginia, Robert M Berne Cardiovasc Res Ctr, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA.",tjha@illinois.edu; maschwartz@virginia.edu,"Ha, Taekjip/B-9506-2009; Parsons, Maddy/B-2203-2013","Ha, Taekjip/0000-0003-2195-6258; Parsons, Maddy/0000-0002-2021-8379","USPHS [U54 GM64346, 5T32-HL007284, R21 RR025341]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [GR3399/1-1]; AHA; US National Science Foundation Physics Frontier Center [0822613]; Royal Society; National Science Foundation [DGE-0221664]","We thank R.

The mammalian immune response is a striking example of the coordination of different cell types(1). Cell-to-cell communication is primarily mediated by signalling molecules that form spatiotemporal concentration gradients, requiring cells to respond to a wide range of signal intensities(2). Here we use high-throughput microfluidic cell culture(3) and fluorescence microscopy, quantitative gene expression analysis and mathematical modelling to investigate how single mammalian cells respond to different concentrations of the signalling molecule tumour-necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and relay information to the gene expression programs by means of the transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B. We measured NF-kappa B activity in thousands of live cells under TNF-alpha doses covering four orders of magnitude. We find, in contrast to population-level studies with bulk assays(2), that the activation is heterogeneous and is a digital process at the single-cell level with fewer cells responding at lower doses. Cells also encode a subtle set of analogue parameters to modulate the outcome; these parameters include NF-kappa B peak intensity, response time and number of oscillations. We developed a stochastic mathematical model that reproduces both the digital and analogue dynamics as well as most gene expression profiles at all measured conditions, constituting a broadly applicable model for TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappa B signalling in various types of cells. These results highlight the value of high-throughput quantitative measurements with single-cell resolution in understanding how biological systems operate.","[Tay, Savas; Hughey, Jacob J.; Lee, Timothy K.; Quake, Stephen R.; Covert, Markus W.] Stanford Univ, Dept Bioengn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Tay, Savas; Quake, Stephen R.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lipniacki, Tomasz] Inst Fundamental Technol Res, PL-02106 Warsaw, Poland","Covert, MW (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Bioengn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",tlipnia@ippt.gov.pl; quake@stanford.edu; mcovert@stanford.edu,,"Hughey, Jacob/0000-0002-1558-6089",NIH; NCI [K99CA125994]; Foundation for Polish Science [TEAM 2009-3/6]; NSF/NIH [R01-GM086885]; Stanford Graduate Fellowship; Stanford Bio-X Graduate Fellowship,"We thank A.

This coupling has been experimentally demonstrated through ion interaction effects(3,4) and cysteine accessibility(1), and is associated with a well defined boundary of energetically coupled residues(2). The structure of the K+ channel KcsA in its fully open conformation, in addition to four other partial channel openings, richly illustrates the structural basis of activation-inactivation gating(5). Here, we identify the mechanistic principles by which movements on the inner bundle gate trigger conformational changes at the selectivity filter, leading to the non-conductive C-type inactivated state. Analysis of a series of KcsA open structures suggests that, as a consequence of the hinge-bending and rotation of the TM2 helix, the aromatic ring of Phe 103 tilts towards residues Thr 74 and Thr 75 in the pore-helix and towards Ile 100 in the neighbouring subunit. This allows the network of hydrogen bonds among residues Trp 67, Glu 71 and Asp 80 to destabilize the selectivity filter(6,7), allowing entry to its non-conductive conformation. Mutations at position 103 have a size-dependent effect on gating kinetics: small side-chain substitutions F103A and F103C severely impair inactivation kinetics, whereas larger side chains such as F103W have more subtle effects. This suggests that the allosteric coupling between the inner helical bundle and the selectivity filter might rely on straightforward mechanical deformation propagated through a network of steric contacts. Average interactions calculated from molecular dynamics simulations show favourable open-state interaction-energies between Phe 103 and the surrounding residues. We probed similar interactions in the Shaker K+ channel where inactivation was impaired in the mutant I470A. We propose that side-chain rearrangements at position 103 mechanically couple activation and inactivation in KcsA and a variety of other K+ channels.","[Cuello, Luis G.; Jogini, Vishwanath; Cortes, D.

Understanding how electrons in matter respond to ultra-intense X-ray radiation is essential for all applications. Here we reveal the nature of the electronic response in a free atom to unprecedented high-intensity, short-wavelength, high-fluence radiation (respectively 10(18) W cm(-2), 1.5-0.6 nm, similar to 10(5) X-ray photons per angstrom(2)). At this fluence, the neon target inevitably changes during the course of a single femtosecond-duration X-ray pulse-by sequentially ejecting electrons-to produce fully-stripped neon through absorption of six photons. Rapid photoejection of inner-shell electrons produces 'hollow' atoms and an intensity-induced X-ray transparency. Such transparency, due to the presence of inner-shell vacancies, can be induced in all atomic, molecular and condensed matter systems at high intensity. Quantitative comparison with theory allows us to extract LCLS fluence and pulse duration. Our successful modelling of X-ray/atom interactions using a straightforward rate equation approach augurs favourably for extension to complex systems.","[Young, L.; Kanter, E.

Adult cardiomyocytes in mice primarily express alpha-myosin heavy chain (alpha-MHC, also known as Myh6), whereas embryonic cardiomyocytes express beta-MHC (also known as Myh7). Cardiac stress triggers adult hearts to undergo hypertrophy and a shift from alpha-MHC to fetal beta-MHC expression. Here we show that Brg1, a chromatin-remodelling protein, has a critical role in regulating cardiac growth, differentiation and gene expression. In embryos, Brg1 promotes myocyte proliferation by maintaining Bmp10 and suppressing p57(kip2) expression. It preserves fetal cardiac differentiation by interacting with histone deacetylase (HDAC) and poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) to repress alpha-MHC and activate beta-MHC. In adults, Brg1 (also known as Smarca4) is turned off in cardiomyocytes. It is reactivated by cardiac stresses and forms a complex with its embryonic partners, HDAC and PARP, to induce a pathological alpha-MHC to beta-MHC shift. Preventing Brg1 re-expression decreases hypertrophy and reverses this MHC switch. BRG1 is activated in certain patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, its level correlating with disease severity and MHC changes. Our studies show that Brg1 maintains cardiomyocytes in an embryonic state, and demonstrate an epigenetic mechanism by which three classes of chromatin-modifying factors-Brg1, HDAC and PARP-cooperate to control developmental and pathological gene expression.","[Hang, Calvin T.; Yang, Jin; Han, Pei; Cheng, Hsiu-Ling; Shang, Ching; Ashley, Euan; Chang, Ching-Pin] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Cardiovasc Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Zhou, Bin] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Mol Genet, Bronx, NY 10461 USA; [Zhou, Bin] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Pediat, Bronx, NY 10461 USA; [Zhou, Bin] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Med, Bronx, NY 10461 USA","Chang, CP (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Cardiovasc Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",chingpin@stanford.edu,"Pei, Han/E-8237-2012; Yang, Jin /C-5468-2013",,NIH; American Heart Association (AHA); Children's Heart Foundation; March of Dimes Foundation; Office of the University of California; California Institute of Regenerative Medicine; Kaiser Foundation; Baxter Foundation; Oak Foundation; Stanford Cardiovascular Institute; Kirschstein-NRSA Postdoctoral Fellowship,"We thank B.

Defects in this system are linked with numerous human diseases. Although conserved protein kinase, lipid kinase and ubiquitin-like protein conjugation subnetworks controlling autophagosome formation and cargo recruitment have been defined, our understanding of the global organization of this system is limited. Here we report a proteomic analysis of the autophagy interaction network in human cells under conditions of ongoing (basal) autophagy, revealing a network of 751 interactions among 409 candidate interacting proteins with extensive connectivity among subnetworks. Many new autophagy interaction network components have roles in vesicle trafficking, protein or lipid phosphorylation and protein ubiquitination, and affect autophagosome number or flux when depleted by RNA interference. The six ATG8 orthologues in humans (MAP1LC3/GABARAP proteins) interact with a cohort of 67 proteins, with extensive binding partner overlap between family members, and frequent involvement of a conserved surface on ATG8 proteins known to interact with LC3-interacting regions in partner proteins. These studies provide a global view of the mammalian autophagy interaction landscape and a resource for mechanistic analysis of this critical protein homeostasis pathway.","[Behrends, Christian; Sowa, Mathew E.; Harper, J.

Much less is clear in bacterial cells where the spatial distribution of mature mRNA remains ambiguous. Using a sensitive method based on quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization, we show here that in Caulobacter crescentus and Escherichia coli, chromosomally expressed mRNAs largely display limited dispersion from their site of transcription during their lifetime. We estimate apparent diffusion coefficients at least two orders of magnitude lower than expected for freely diffusing mRNA, and provide evidence in C. crescentus that this mRNA localization restricts ribosomal mobility. Furthermore, C. crescentus RNase E appears associated with the DNA independently of its mRNA substrates. Collectively, our findings show that bacteria can spatially organize translation and, potentially, mRNA decay by using the chromosome layout as a template.

This one-parameter behaviour allows type Ia supernovae to be calibrated as cosmological 'standard candles', and led to the discovery of an accelerating Universe(2,3). Recent investigations, however, have revealed that the true nature of type Ia supernovae is more complicated. Theoretically, it has been suggested(4-8) that the initial thermonuclear sparks are ignited at an offset from the centre of the white-dwarf progenitor, possibly as a result of convection before the explosion(4). Observationally, the diversity seen in the spectral evolution of type Ia supernovae beyond the luminosity-decline-rate relation is an unresolved issue(9,10). Here we report that the spectral diversity is a consequence of random directions from which an asymmetric explosion is viewed. Our findings suggest that the spectral evolution diversity is no longer a concern when using type Ia supernovae as cosmological standard candles. Furthermore, this indicates that ignition at an offset from the centre is a generic feature of type Ia supernovae.","[Maeda, K.; Nomoto, K.; Tanaka, M.] Univ Tokyo, IPMU, Chiba 2778583, Japan; [Benetti, S.] INAF Osservatorio Astron Padova, I-35122 Padua, Italy; [Stritzinger, M.] Las Campanas Observ, Carnegie Inst Sci, La Serena, Chile; [Stritzinger, M.; Sollerman, J.; Leloudas, G.] Univ Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Inst, Dark Cosmol Ctr, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark; [Roepke, F.

Of particular interest is the back-action of electrons and photons on mechanical oscillators, which can lead to cooling and amplification of mechanical motion(4-6). Furthermore, feedback, which is naturally associated with back-action, has been predicted to have significant consequences for the noise of a detector coupled to a mechanical oscillator(7,8). Recently it has also been demonstrated that such feedback effects lead to strong coupling between single-electron transport and mechanical motion in carbon nanotube nanomechanical resonators(9,10). Here we present noise measurements which show that the mesoscopic back-action of electrons tunnelling through a radio-frequency quantum point contact(11) causes driven vibrations of the host crystal. This effect is a remarkable macroscopic manifestation of microscopic quantum behaviour, where the motion of a mechanical oscillator-the host crystal, which consists of on the order of 10(20) atoms-is determined by statistical fluctuations of tunnelling electrons.","[Stettenheim, Joel; Pan, Feng; Bal, Mustafa; Xue, Weiwei; Blencowe, M.

Harnessing light-matter interactions in principle allows operation of solid state devices under new physical principles: for example, the a. c. optical Stark effect (OSE) has enabled coherent quantum control schemes of spins in semiconductors, with the potential for realizing quantum devices based on spin qubits(2-5). However, as the dimension of semiconductors is reduced, light-matter coupling is typically weakened, thus limiting applications at the nanoscale. Recent experiments have demonstrated significant enhancement of nanoscale light-matter interactions, albeit with the need for a high-finesse cavity(6,7), ultimately preventing device down-scaling and integration. Here we report that a sizable OSE can be achieved at substantial energy detuning in a cavity-free colloidal metal-semiconductor core-shell hetero-nanostructure, in which the metal surface plasmon is tuned to resonate spectrally with a semiconductor exciton transition. We further demonstrate that this resonantly enhanced OSE exhibits polarization dependence and provides a viable mechanism for coherent ultrafast spin manipulation within colloidal nanostructures. The plasmon-exciton resonant nature further enables tailoring of both OSE and spin manipulation by tuning plasmon resonance intensity and frequency. These results open a pathway for tailoring light-matter-spin interactions through plasmon-exciton resonant coupling in a judiciously engineered nanostructure, and offer a basis for future applications in quantum information processing at the nanoscale. More generally, integrated nanostructures with resonantly enhanced light-matter interactions should serve as a test bed for other emerging fields, including nano-biophotonics and nano-energy(8,9).","[Zhang, Jiatao; Tang, Yun; Lee, Kwan; Ouyang, Min] Univ Maryland, Dept Phys, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Zhang, Jiatao; Tang, Yun; Lee, Kwan; Ouyang, Min] Univ Maryland, Ctr Nanophys & Adv Mat, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Ouyang, M (reprint author), Univ Maryland, Dept Phys, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",mouyang@umd.edu,"TANG, Yun/C-7602-2016","LEE, KWAN/0000-0002-8269-6579",ONR [N000140710787]; NSF [DMR-0547194]; Beckman YIP grant [0609259093],"We acknowledge funding from an ONR YIP award (N000140710787), an NSF CAREER award (DMR-0547194), and a Beckman YIP grant (0609259093).

The extent to which the biosphere can act as a buffer against rising atmospheric CO2 concentration in global climate change projections remains uncertain at the present stage(1-4). Biogeochemical theory predicts that soil nitrogen (N) scarcity may limit natural ecosystem response to elevated CO2 concentration, diminishing the CO2-fertilization effect on terrestrial plant productivity in unmanaged ecosystems(3-7). Recent models have incorporated such carbon-nitrogen interactions and suggest that anthropogenic N sources could help sustain the future CO2-fertilization effect(8,9). However, conclusive demonstration that added N enhances plant productivity in response to CO2-fertilization in natural ecosystems remains elusive. Here we manipulated atmospheric CO2 concentration and soil N availability in a herbaceous brackish wetland where plant community composition is dominated by a C-3 sedge and C-4 grasses, and is capable of responding rapidly to environmental change(10). We found that N addition enhanced the CO2-stimulation of plant productivity in the first year of a multi-year experiment, indicating N-limitation of the CO2 response. But we also found that N addition strongly promotes the encroachment of C-4 plant species that respond less strongly to elevated CO2 concentrations. Overall, we found that the observed shift in the plant community composition ultimately suppresses the CO2-stimulation of plant productivity by the third and fourth years. Although extensive research has shown that global change factors such as elevated CO2 concentrations and N pollution affect plant species differently(11-13), and that they may drive plant community changes(14-17), we demonstrate that plant community shifts can act as a feedback effect that alters the whole ecosystem response to elevated CO2 concentrations. Moreover, we suggest that trade-offs between the abilities of plant taxa to respond positively to different perturbations may constrain natural ecosystem response to global change.","[Langley, J.

Except for the nearly 2-Gyr-old coil-shaped fossil Grypania spiralis(6,7), which may have been eukaryotic, evidence for morphological and taxonomic bio-diversification of macroorganisms only occurs towards the beginning of the Mesoproterozoic era (1.6-1.0 Gyr)(8). Here we report the discovery of centimetre-sized structures from the 2.1-Gyr-old black shales of the Palaeoproterozoic Francevillian B Formation in Gabon, which we interpret as highly organized and spatially discrete populations of colonial organisms. The structures are up to 12 cm in size and have characteristic shapes, with a simple but distinct ground pattern of flexible sheets and, usually, a permeating radial fabric. Geochemical analyses suggest that the sediments were deposited under an oxygenated water column. Carbon and sulphur isotopic data indicate that the structures were distinct biogenic objects, fossilized by pyritization early in the formation of the rock. The growth patterns deduced from the fossil morphologies suggest that the organisms showed cell-to-cell signalling and coordinated responses, as is commonly associated with multicellular organization(9). The Gabon fossils, occurring after the 2.45-2.32-Gyr increase in atmospheric oxygen concentration(10), may be seen as ancient representatives of multicellular life, which expanded so rapidly 1.5 Gyr later, in the Cambrian explosion.","[El Albani, Abderrazak; Fontaine, Claude; Ossa, Frantz Ossa; Sardini, Paul; Meunier, Alain] Univ Poitiers, CNRS, UMR INSU 6269, Lab HYDRASA, F-86022 Poitiers, France; [Bengtson, Stefan; Hammarlund, Emma U.] Swedish Museum Nat Hist, Dept Palaeozool, SE-10405 Stockholm, Sweden; [Canfield, Donald E.; Hammarlund, Emma U.] Nord Ctr Earth Evolut, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark; [Bekker, Andrey] Univ Manitoba, Dept Geol Sci, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada; [Macchiarelli, Roberto] Univ Poitiers, Dept Geosci, Ctr Microtomog, F-86022 Poitiers, France; [Macchiarelli, Roberto] Museum Natl Hist Nat, CNRS, UMR 7194, Dept Prehist, F-75005 Paris, France; [Mazurier, Arnaud] CRI Biopole, Soc Etud Rech Mat, F-86000 Poitiers, France; [Hammarlund, Emma U.] Stockholm Univ, Dept Geol Sci, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Boulvais, Philippe; Pierson-Wickmann, Anne-Catherine] Univ Rennes, UMR 6118, Dept Geosci, F-35042 Rennes, France; [Dupuy, Jean-Jacques] Bur Rech Geol & Minieres, F-45060 Orleans, France; [Fuersich, Franz T.] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, GeoZentrum Nordbayern, Fachgrp Palaoumwelt, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany; [Gauthier-Lafaye, Francois] CNRS, UMR 7517, Lab Hydrol & Geochim Strasbourg, F-67084 Strasbourg, France; [Janvier, Philippe] Museum Natl Hist Nat, CNRS, UMR 7207, Dept Hist Terre, F-75005 Paris, France; [Javaux, Emmanuelle] Univ Liege, Dept Geol, Unite Rech Paleobot Paleopalynol Micropaleontol, B-4000 Sart Tilman Par Liege, Belgium; [Riboulleau, Armelle; Vachard, Daniel] Univ Lille 1, CNRS, FRE 3298, Lab Geosyst, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France; [Whitehouse, Martin] Swedish Museum Nat Hist, Lab Isotope Geol, SE-10405 Stockholm, Sweden","El Albani, A (reprint author), Univ Poitiers, CNRS, UMR INSU 6269, Lab HYDRASA, F-86022 Poitiers, France.",abder.albani@univ-poitiers.fr,"Canfield, Don/C-1735-2012; Pierson-Wickmann, Anne-Catherine/J-3383-2012; Whitehouse, Martin/E-1425-2013; Arnaud, Mazurier/Q-3199-2017","Canfield, Don/0000-0001-7602-8366; Pierson-Wickmann, Anne-Catherine/0000-0002-7715-3772; Whitehouse, Martin/0000-0003-2227-577X; Arnaud, Mazurier/0000-0003-1894-0554; Hammarlund, Emma/0000-0001-7625-4793; Bengtson, Stefan/0000-0003-0206-5791",French Embassy at Libreville; French Ministry for Foreign Affairs; Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation; French CNRS-INSU; Bureau de Recherches Geologiques et Minieres (BRGM); Danish National Research Foundation; Swedish Research Council,"We thank the Ministry of Mines, Oil, Energy and Hydraulic Resources and the General Direction of Mines and Geology of Gabon for collaboration and assistance, and the French Embassy at Libreville and the French Ministry for Foreign Affairs for support.

Lacking a functional upper dentition, it relies on suction for catching its prey(3); in contrast, several smaller Miocene sperm whales (Physeteroidea) have been interpreted as raptorial (versus suction) feeders(4,5), analogous to the modern killer whale Orcinus orca. Whereas very large physeteroid teeth have been discovered in various Miocene localities, associated diagnostic cranial remains have not been found so far(6-8). Here we report the discovery of a new giant sperm whale from the Middle Miocene of Peru (approximately 12-13 million years ago), Leviathan melvillei, described on the basis of a skull with teeth and mandible. With a 3-m-long head, very large upper and lower teeth (maximum diameter and length of 12 cm and greater than 36 cm, respectively), robust jaws and a temporal fossa considerably larger than in Physeter, this stem physeteroid represents one of the largest raptorial predators and, to our knowledge, the biggest tetrapod bite ever found. The appearance of gigantic raptorial sperm whales in the fossil record coincides with a phase of diversification and size-range increase of the baleen-bearing mysticetes in the Miocene. We propose that Leviathan fed mostly on high-energy content medium-size baleen whales. As a top predator, together with the contemporaneous giant shark Carcharocles megalodon, it probably had a profound impact on the structuring of Miocene marine communities. The development of a vast supracranial basin in Leviathan, extending on the rostrum as in Physeter, might indicate the presence of an enlarged spermaceti organ in the former that is not associated with deep diving or obligatory suction feeding.","[Lambert, Olivier] Inst Royal Sci Nat Belgique, Dept Paleontol, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [Bianucci, Giovanni] Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Sci Terra, I-56126 Pisa, Italy; [Post, Klaas; Reumer, Jelle] Nat Hist Museum Rotterdam, NL-3001 KL Rotterdam, Netherlands; [de Muizon, Christian] Museum Natl Hist Nat, Dept Hist Terre, F-75005 Paris, France; [Salas-Gismondi, Rodolfo; Urbina, Mario] Univ Nacl Mayor San Marcos, Museo Hist Nat, Lima 14, Peru; [Reumer, Jelle] Univ Utrecht, Dept Geosci, NL-3508 TA Utrecht, Netherlands","Lambert, O (reprint author), Museum Natl Hist Nat, Dept Hist Terre, F-75005 Paris, France.",olambert@mnhn.fr; bianucci@dst.unipi.it,"De Muizon, Christian/P-4335-2017","De Muizon, Christian/0000-0002-1247-8867; Urbina, Mario/0000-0002-1898-9051",Board of the Natuurhistorisch Museum Rotterdam Foundation; Belgian Federal Science Policy Office,"We thank W.

Conservation efforts often focus on restoring or maintaining species number(8,9), reflecting the well-known impacts of richness on many ecological processes(1-4). In contrast, the ecological effects of disrupted evenness have received far less attention(7), and developing strategies for restoring evenness remains a conceptual challenge(7). In farmlands, agricultural pest-management practices often lead to altered food web structure and communities dominated by a few common species, which together contribute to pest outbreaks(6,7,10,11). Here we show that organic farming methods mitigate this ecological damage by promoting evenness among natural enemies. In field enclosures, very even communities of predator and pathogen biological control agents, typical of organic farms, exerted the strongest pest control and yielded the largest plants. In contrast, pest densities were high and plant biomass was low when enemy evenness was disrupted, as is typical under conventional management. Our results were independent of the numerically dominant predator or pathogen species, and so resulted from evenness itself. Moreover, evenness effects among natural enemy groups were independent and complementary. Our results strengthen the argument that rejuvenation of ecosystem function requires restoration of species evenness, rather than just richness. Organic farming potentially offers a means of returning functional evenness to ecosystems.","[Crowder, David W.; Northfield, Tobin D.; Snyder, William E.] Washington State Univ, Dept Entomol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Strand, Michael R.] Univ Georgia, Dept Entomol, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Crowder, DW (reprint author), Washington State Univ, Dept Entomol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",dcrowder@wsu.edu,"Northfield, Tobin/I-2323-2013","Northfield, Tobin/0000-0002-0563-485X",National Research Initiative of the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture,"J.

The genetic basis of AA is largely unknown. We undertook a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a sample of 1,054 cases and 3,278 controls and identified 139 single nucleotide polymorphisms that are significantly associated with AA (P <= 5 x 10(-7)). Here we show an association with genomic regions containing several genes controlling the activation and proliferation of regulatory T cells (T(reg) cells), cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4), interleukin (IL)-2/IL-21, IL-2 receptor A (IL-2RA; CD25) and Eos (also known as Ikaros family zinc finger 4; IKZF4), as well as the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region. We also find association evidence for regions containing genes expressed in the hair follicle itself (PRDX5 and STX17). A region of strong association resides within the ULBP (cytomegalovirus UL16-binding protein) gene cluster on chromosome 6q25.1, encoding activating ligands of the natural killer cell receptor NKG2D that have not previously been implicated in an autoimmune disease. By probing the role of ULBP3 in disease pathogenesis, we also show that its expression in lesional scalp from patients with AA is markedly upregulated in the hair follicle dermal sheath during active disease. This study provides evidence for the involvement of both innate and acquired immunity in the pathogenesis of AA. We have defined the genetic underpinnings of AA, placing it within the context of shared pathways among autoimmune diseases, and implicating a novel disease mechanism, the upregulation of ULBP ligands, in triggering autoimmunity.","[Petukhova, Lynn; Shimomura, Yutaka; Kim, Hyunmi; Singh, Pallavi; Christiano, Angela M.] Columbia Univ, Dept Dermatol, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Duvic, Madeleine] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Dermatol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Hordinsky, Maria] Univ Minnesota, Dept Dermatol, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Norris, David] Univ Colorado, Dept Dermatol, Denver, CO 80010 USA; [Price, Vera] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Dermatol, San Francisco, CA 94115 USA; [Lee, Annette; Gregersen, Peter K.] N Shore LIJHS, Feinstein Inst Med Res, Manhasset, NY 11030 USA; [Chen, Wei V.; Amos, Christopher I.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Epidemiol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Meyer, Katja C.; Paus, Ralf] Univ Lubeck, Dept Dermatol, D-23538 Lubeck, Germany; [Paus, Ralf] Univ Manchester, Sch Translat Med, Manchester M13 9PT, Lancs, England; [Jahoda, Colin A.

Exocrine gland-secreting peptide 1 (ESP1) is a 7-kDa peptide that is released intomale tear fluids and stimulates vomeronasal sensory neurons in female mice(4). Here, we describe the molecular and neural mechanisms that are involved in the decoding of ESP1 signals in the vomeronasal system, which leads to behavioural output in female mice. ESP1 is recognized by a specific vomeronasal receptor, V2Rp5, and the ligand-receptor interaction results in sex-specific signal transmission to the amygdaloid and hypothalamic nuclei via the accessory olfactory bulb. Consequently, ESP1 enhances female sexual receptive behaviour upon male mounting (lordosis), allowing successful copulation. In V2Rp5-deficient mice, ESP1 induces neither neural activation nor sexual behaviour. These findings show that ESP1 is a crucial male pheromone that regulates female reproductive behaviour through a specific receptor in the mouse vomeronasal system.","[Haga, Sachiko; Sato, Toru; Sato, Koji; Matsuda, Soichiro; Touhara, Kazushige] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Dept Appl Biol Chem, Tokyo 1138657, Japan; [Hattori, Tatsuya; Kikusui, Takefumi] Azabu Univ, Sch Vet Med, Kanagawa 2298501, Japan; [Kobayakawa, Reiko] Osaka Biosci Inst, Dept Funct Neurosci, Suita, Osaka 5650874, Japan; [Sakano, Hitoshi] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biophys & Biochem, Tokyo 1130032, Japan; [Yoshihara, Yoshihiro] RIKEN, Brain Sci Inst, Lab Neurobiol Synapse, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan","Touhara, K (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Dept Appl Biol Chem, Tokyo 1138657, Japan.",ktouhara@mail.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Yoshihara, Yoshihiro/N-6481-2015",,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan","We thank R.

Is it noise, or does it carry important information-about, for example, the internal state of the organism? Here we address this issue from the bottom up, by asking whether small perturbations to activity in cortical networks are amplified. Based on in vivo whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in rat barrel cortex, we find that a perturbation consisting of a single extra spike in one neuron produces approximately 28 additional spikes in its postsynaptic targets. We also show, using simultaneous intra-and extracellular recordings, that a single spike in a neuron produces a detectable increase in firing rate in the local network. Theoretical analysis indicates that this amplification leads to intrinsic, stimulus-independent variations in membrane potential of the order of +/- 2.2-4.5 mV-variations that are pure noise, and so carry no information at all. Therefore, for the brain to perform reliable computations, it must either use a rate code, or generate very large, fast depolarizing events, such as those proposed by the theory of synfire chains(4,5). However, in our in vivo recordings, we found that such events were very rare. Our findings are thus consistent with the idea that cortex is likely to use primarily a rate code.","[Latham, Peter E.] UCL, Gatsby Computat Neurosci Unit, London WC1N 3AR, England; [London, Michael; Roth, Arnd; Beeren, Lisa; Haeusser, Michael] UCL, Wolfson Inst Biomed Res, London WC1E 6BT, England; [London, Michael; Roth, Arnd; Beeren, Lisa; Haeusser, Michael] UCL, Dept Neurosci Physiol & Pharmacol, London WC1E 6BT, England","Latham, PE (reprint author), UCL, Gatsby Computat Neurosci Unit, Queen Sq, London WC1N 3AR, England.",pel@gatsby.ucl.ac.uk,,,Gatsby Charitable Foundation; US National Institute of Mental Health [R01 MH62447]; Wellcome Trust; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; Medical Research Council,"We thank P.

The molecular mechanisms underlying pattern formation, particularly the regulation of formative cell divisions, remain poorly understood. In Arabidopsis, formative divisions generating the root ground tissue are controlled by SHORTROOT (SHR) and SCARECROW (SCR)(4-6). Here we show, using cell-type-specific transcriptional effects of SHR and SCR combined with data from chromatin immunoprecipitation-based microarray experiments, that SHR regulates the spatiotemporal activation of specific genes involved in cell division. Coincident with the onset of a specific formative division, SHR and SCR directly activate a D-type cyclin; furthermore, altering the expression of this cyclin resulted in formative division defects. Our results indicate that proper pattern formation is achieved through transcriptional regulation of specific cell-cycle genes in a cell-type-and developmental-stage-specific context. Taken together, we provide evidence for a direct link between developmental regulators, specific components of the cell-cycle machinery and organ patterning.","[Sozzani, R.; Cui, H.; Moreno-Risueno, M.

The tumours sampled in this study were taken from a broad spectrum of sites and stages. High-viability cells isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and re-suspended in a matrigel vehicle were implanted into T-, B- and natural-killer-deficient Rag2(-/-) gamma c(-/-) mice. The CD271(+) subset of cells was the tumour-initiating population in 90% (nine out of ten) of melanomas tested. Transplantation of isolated CD271(+) melanoma cells into engrafted human skin or bone in Rag2(-/-) gamma c(-/-) mice resulted in melanoma; however, melanoma did not develop after transplantation of isolated CD271(-) cells. We also show that in mice, tumours derived from transplanted human CD271(-) melanoma cells were capable of metastatsis in vivo.

Mammalian genomes encode roughly 70 F-box proteins, but only a handful have established functions(3,4). The F-box protein family obtained its name from Cyclin F (also called Fbxo1), in which the F-box motif (the similar to 40-amino-acid domain required for binding to Skp1) was first described(5). Cyclin F, which is encoded by an essential gene, also contains a cyclin box domain, but in contrast to most cyclins, it does not bind or activate any cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs)(5-7). However, like other cyclins, Cyclin F oscillates during the cell cycle, with protein levels peaking in G2. Despite its essential nature and status as the founding member of the F-box protein family, Cyclin F remains an orphan protein, whose functions are unknown. Starting from an unbiased screen, we identified CP110, a protein that is essential for centrosome duplication, as an interactor and substrate of Cyclin F. Using a mode of substrate binding distinct from other F-box protein-substrate pairs, CP110 and Cyclin F physically associate on the centrioles during the G2 phase of the cell cycle, and CP110 is ubiquitylated by the SCFCyclin F ubiquitin ligase complex, leading to its degradation. siRNA-mediated depletion of Cyclin F in G2 induces centrosomal and mitotic abnormalities, such as multipolar spindles and asymmetric, bipolar spindles with lagging chromosomes. These phenotypes were reverted by co-silencing CP110 and were recapitulated by expressing a stable mutant of CP110 that cannot bind Cyclin F. Finally, expression of a stable CP110 mutant in cultured cells also promotes the formation of micronuclei, a hallmark of chromosome instability. We propose that SCFCyclin F-mediated degradation of CP110 is required for the fidelity of mitosis and genome integrity.","[D'Angiolella, Vincenzo; Donato, Valerio; Vijayakumar, Sangeetha; Dynlacht, Brian; Pagano, Michele] NYU, Sch Med, Inst Canc, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Saraf, Anita; Florens, Laurence; Washburn, Michael P.] Stowers Inst Med Res, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; [Washburn, Michael P.] Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Kansas City, KS 66160 USA; [Pagano, Michele] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chevy Chase, MD USA","Pagano, M (reprint author), NYU, Sch Med, Inst Canc, Dept Pathol, 522 1st Ave,SRB 1107, New York, NY 10016 USA.",michele.pagano@nyumc.org,,"Florens, Laurence/0000-0002-9310-6650; pagano, michele/0000-0003-3210-2442; Washburn, Michael/0000-0001-7568-2585","American Italian Cancer Foundation; March of Dimes [1-FY08-372]; National Institutes of Health [R01-GM057587, R37-CA076584, R21-AG032560]; Stowers Institute for Medical Research","We thank S.

Amides are also present in many therapeutic small molecules. The construction of amide bonds using available methods relies principally on dehydrative approaches, although oxidative and radical-based methods are representative alternatives. In nearly every example, carbon and nitrogen bear electrophilic and nucleophilic character, respectively, during the carbon-nitrogen bond-forming step. Here we show that activation of amines and nitroalkanes with an electrophilic iodine source can lead directly to amide products. Preliminary observations support a mechanism in which the polarities of the two reactants are reversed (German, umpolung) during carbon-nitrogen bond formation relative to traditional approaches. The use of nitroalkanes as acyl anion equivalents provides a conceptually innovative approach to amide and peptide synthesis, and one that might ultimately provide for efficient peptide synthesis that is fully reliant on enantioselective methods.","[Shen, Bo; Makley, Dawn M.; Johnston, Jeffrey N.] Vanderbilt Univ, Vanderbilt Inst Chem Biol, Dept Chem, Nashville, TN 37235 USA","Johnston, JN (reprint author), Vanderbilt Univ, Vanderbilt Inst Chem Biol, Dept Chem, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.",jeffrey.n.johnston@vanderbilt.edu,"Shen, Bo/D-6294-2011","Johnston, Jeffrey/0000-0002-0885-636X","Vanderbilt Institute of Chemical Biology; NIH [GM084333, T32 GM065086]","This work was supported by the Vanderbilt Institute of Chemical Biology, and in part (catalyst preparation and development) by the NIH (GM084333 and Chemistry-Biology Interface training grant T32 GM065086 in support of D.M.M.).",,45,166,167,3,78,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Jun,2010,465,7301,,,,,1027,U82,,10.1038/nature09125,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,614KI,WOS:000279056900042,20577205.0,No,,,11/20/17,jeffrey n.,johnston,na,na,na,na,na

However, given that microRNAs bind to RNAs, we hypothesized that RNAs could possess a regulatory role that relies on their ability to compete for microRNA binding, independently of their protein-coding function. As a model for the protein-coding-independent role of RNAs, we describe the functional relationship between the mRNAs produced by the PTEN tumour suppressor gene and its pseudogene PTENP1 and the critical consequences of this interaction. We find that PTENP1 is biologically active as it can regulate cellular levels of PTEN and exert a growth-suppressive role. We also show that the PTENP1 locus is selectively lost in human cancer. We extended our analysis to other cancer-related genes that possess pseudogenes, such as oncogenic KRAS. We also demonstrate that the transcripts of protein-coding genes such as PTEN are biologically active. These findings attribute a novel biological role to expressed pseudogenes, as they can regulate coding gene expression, and reveal a non-coding function for mRNAs.","[Poliseno, Laura; Salmena, Leonardo; Haveman, William J.; Pandolfi, Pier Paolo] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr,Dept Med, Canc Genet Program,Beth Israel Deaconess Canc Ctr, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Poliseno, Laura; Salmena, Leonardo; Haveman, William J.; Pandolfi, Pier Paolo] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr,Dept Pathol, Canc Genet Program,Beth Israel Deaconess Canc Ctr, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Zhang, Jiangwen] Harvard Univ, FAS Res Comp, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Zhang, Jiangwen] Harvard Univ, FAS Ctr Syst Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Carver, Brett] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Surg, Human Oncol & Pathogenesis Program, New York, NY 10021 USA","Pandolfi, PP (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr,Dept Med, Canc Genet Program,Beth Israel Deaconess Canc Ctr, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",ppandolf@bidmc.harvard.edu,"Zhang, Jiangwen/A-7654-2013; Poliseno, Laura/B-5711-2012","Poliseno, Laura/0000-0001-6557-955X; Salmena, Leonardo/0000-0003-4023-658X",Istituto Toscano Tumori; American Italian Cancer Foundation; Human Frontier Science Program; Canadian Institutes of Health Research; NIH [R01 CA-82328-09],"We thank Pandolfi laboratory members for critical discussions, in particular A.

We also show by structural, biochemical and genetic analysis that the two Ts are maintained in a stable configuration in the active site via interactions with Gln 55, Arg 73 and Met 74.

Pol eta acts like a 'molecular splint' to stabilize damaged DNA in a normal B-form conformation. An enlarged active site accommodates the thymine dimer with excellent stereochemistry for two-metal ion catalysis. Two residues conserved among Pol eta orthologues form specific hydrogen bonds with the lesion and the incoming nucleotide to assist translesion synthesis. On the basis of the structures, eight Pol eta missense mutations causing XPV can be rationalized as undermining the molecular splint or perturbing the active-site alignment.

If the orbital velocity of the planet could be determined, the masses of both star and planet could be calculated using Newton's law of gravity, just as in the case of stellar double-line eclipsing binaries. Here we report high-dispersion ground-based spectroscopy of a transit of the extrasolar planet HD 209458b. We see a significant wavelength shift in absorption lines from carbon monoxide in the planet's atmosphere, which we conclude arises from a change in the radial component of the planet's orbital velocity. The masses of the star and planet are 1.00 +/- 0.22M(Sun) and 0.64 +/- 0.09M(Jup) respectively. A blueshift of the carbon monoxide signal of approximately 2 km s(-1) with respect to the systemic velocity of the host star suggests the presence of a strong wind flowing from the irradiated dayside to the non-irradiated nightside of the planet within the 0.01-0.1 mbar atmospheric pressure range probed by these observations. The strength of the carbon monoxide signal suggests a carbon monoxide mixing ratio of (1-3) x 10(-3) in this planet's upper atmosphere.","[Snellen, Ignas A. G.; de Mooij, Ernst J.

Classical measurement and reconstruction strategies for storing light must necessarily destroy quantum information as a consequence of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. There has been significant effort directed towards the development of devices so-called quantum memories-capable of avoiding this penalty. So far, successful demonstrations(1-6) of non-classical storage and on-demand recall have used atomic vapours and have been limited to low efficiencies, of less than 17 per cent, using weak quantum states with an average photon number of around one. Here we report a low-noise, highly efficient (up to 69 per cent) quantum memory for light that uses a solid-state medium. The device allows the storage and recall of light more faithfully than is possible using a classical memory, for weak coherent states at the single-photon level through to bright states of up to 500 photons. For input coherent states containing on average 30 photons or fewer, the performance exceeded the no-cloning limit. This guaranteed that more information about the inputs was retrieved from the memory than was left behind or destroyed, a feature that will provide security in communications applications.","[Hedges, Morgan P.; Sellars, Matthew J.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Phys & Engn, Laser Phys Ctr, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Longdell, Jevon J.] Univ Otago, Dept Phys, Jack Dodd Ctr, Dunedin 9016, New Zealand; [Li, Yongmin] Shanxi Univ, State Key Lab Quantum Opt & Quantum Opt Devices, Inst Optoelect, Taiyuan 030006, Peoples R China","Hedges, MP (reprint author), Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Phys & Engn, Laser Phys Ctr, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",mph111@physics.anu.edu.au,"Sellars, Matthew/J-3130-2014","Sellars, Matthew/0000-0002-0502-0444",Australian Research Council; New Zealand Foundation for Research Science and Technology,"The authors gratefully acknowledge S.

Of particular interest, because they can be used in the quantum control of one atom by another, are excited Rydberg states(2-4), where wavefunctions are expanded from their ground-state extents of less than 0.1 nm to several nanometres and even beyond; this allows atoms far enough apart to be non-interacting in their ground states to strongly interact in their excited states. For eventual application of such states(5), a solid-state implementation is very desirable. Here we demonstrate the coherent control of impurity wavefunctions in the most ubiquitous donor in a semiconductor, namely phosphorus-doped silicon. In our experiments, we use a free-electron laser to stimulate and observe photon echoes(6,7), the orbital analogue of the Hahn spin echo(8), and Rabi oscillations familiar from magnetic resonance spectroscopy. As well as extending atomic physicists' explorations(1-3,9) of quantum phenomena to the solid state, our work adds coherent terahertz radiation, as a particularly precise regulator of orbitals in solids, to the list of controls, such as pressure and chemical composition, already familiar to materials scientists(10).","[Greenland, P.

Mass balance calculations require that the missing DIC is converted into particulate carbon by photosynthesis(1-3). This DIC uptake represents one of the largest components of net community production in the world ocean(2,4). However, mixed-layer waters in these regions of the ocean typically contain negligible concentrations of plant nutrients such as nitrate and phosphate(3,5). Combined nutrient supply mechanisms including nitrogen fixation, diffusive transport and vertical entrainment are believed to be insufficient to supply the required nutrients for photosynthesis(6,7). The basin-scale potential for episodic nutrient transport by eddy events is unresolved(8,9). As a result, it is not understood how biologically mediated DIC uptake can be supported in the absence of nutrients. Here we report on high-resolution measurements of nitrate (NO(3)(-)) and oxygen (O(2)) concentration made over 21 months using a profiling float deployed near the Hawaii Ocean Time-series station in the North Pacific subtropical gyre. Our measurements demonstrate that as O(2) was produced and DIC was consumed over two annual cycles, a corresponding seasonal deficit in dissolved NO(3)(-) appeared in water at depths from 100 to 250 m. The deep-water deficit in NO(3)(-) was in near-stoichiometric balance with the fixed nitrogen exported to depth. Thus, when the water column from the surface to 250 m is considered as a whole, there is near equivalence between nutrient supply and demand. Short-lived transport events (<10 days) that connect deep stocks of nitrate to nutrient-poor surface waters were clearly present in 12 of the 127 vertical profiles.","[Johnson, Kenneth S.] Monterey Bay Aquarium Res Inst, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA; [Riser, Stephen C.] Univ Washington, Sch Oceanog, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Karl, David M.] Univ Hawaii, Ctr Microbial Oceanog Res & Educ, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA","Johnson, KS (reprint author), Monterey Bay Aquarium Res Inst, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA.",johnson@mbari.org,"Johnson, Kenneth/F-9742-2011","Johnson, Kenneth/0000-0001-5513-5584",David and Lucile Packard Foundation; National Science Foundation; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; US Office of Naval Research; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation; Center for Microbial Oceanography: Research and Education,"This work was made possible by the engineering efforts of L.

Empirical studies have generated controversy because the accuracy of statistical methods that have been used to identify Levy behaviour has recently been questioned(5,6). Consequently, whether foragers exhibit Levy flights in the wild remains unclear. Crucially, moreover, it has not been tested whether observed movement patterns across natural landscapes having different expected resource distributions conform to the theory's central predictions. Here we use maximum-likelihood methods to test for Levy patterns in relation to environmental gradients in the largest animal movement data set assembled for this purpose. Strong support was found for Levy search patterns across 14 species of open-ocean predatory fish (sharks, tuna, billfish and ocean sunfish), with some individuals switching between Levy and Brownian movement as they traversed different habitat types. We tested the spatial occurrence of these two principal patterns and found Levy behaviour to be associated with less productive waters (sparser prey) and Brownian movements to be associated with productive shelf or convergence-front habitats (abundant prey). These results are consistent with the Levy-flight foraging hypothesis(1,7), supporting the contention(8,9) that organism search strategies naturally evolved in such a way that they exploit optimal Levy patterns.","[Humphries, Nicolas E.; Queiroz, Nuno; Dyer, Jennifer R.

Here we show that changes in electrical activity can alter the location of the AIS. In dissociated hippocampal cultures, chronic depolarization with high extracellular potassium moves multiple components of the AIS, including voltage-gated sodium channels, up to 17 mu m away from the soma of excitatory neurons. This movement reverses when neurons are returned to non-depolarized conditions, and depends on the activation of T- and/or L-type voltage-gated calcium channels. The AIS also moved distally when we combined long-term LED (light-emitting diode) photostimulation with sparse neuronal expression of the light-activated cation channel channelrhodopsin-2; here, burst patterning of activity was successful where regular stimulation at the same frequency failed. Furthermore, changes in AIS position correlate with alterations in current thresholds for action potential spiking. Our results show that neurons can regulate the position of an entire subcellular structure according to their ongoing levels and patterns of electrical activity. This novel form of activity-dependent plasticity may fine-tune neuronal excitability during development.","[Grubb, Matthew S.; Burrone, Juan] Kings Coll London, MRC Ctr Dev Neurobiol, London SE1 1UL, England","Grubb, MS (reprint author), Kings Coll London, MRC Ctr Dev Neurobiol, 4th Floor,New Hunts House,Guys Campus, London SE1 1UL, England.",matthew.grubb@kcl.ac.uk; juan.burrone@kcl.ac.uk,"Grubb, Matthew/B-4939-2008","Grubb, Matthew/0000-0002-2673-274X; Burrone, Juan/0000-0003-1233-668X",Wellcome Trust; Lister Institute,"We thank M.

The axon initial segment (AIS) is the site at which neural signals arise(2,3), and should be the most efficient site to regulate neural activity. However, none of the plasticity currently known involves the AIS. We report here that deprivation of auditory input in an avian brainstem auditory neuron leads to an increase in AIS length, thus augmenting the excitability of the neuron. The length of the AIS, defined by the distribution of voltage-gated Na+ channels and the AIS anchoring protein, increased by 1.7 times in seven days after auditory input deprivation. This was accompanied by an increase in the whole-cell Na+ current, membrane excitability and spontaneous firing. Our work demonstrates homeostatic regulation of the AIS, which may contribute to the maintenance of the auditory pathway after hearing loss. Furthermore, plasticity at the spike initiation site suggests a powerful pathway for refining neuronal computation in the face of strong sensory deprivation.","[Kuba, Hiroshi; Oichi, Yuki] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Career Path Promot Unit Young Life Scientists, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Ohmori, Harunori] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Kyoto 6068501, Japan","Kuba, H (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Career Path Promot Unit Young Life Scientists, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.",kuba@nbiol.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Kuba, Hiroshi/I-7519-2014",,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan","We thank G.

Recent work has shown that CD11b(+)CD169(+) macrophages, which populate the subcapsular sinus (SCS) of LNs, are critical for the clearance of viruses from the lymph and for initiating antiviral humoral immune responses(2-4). Here we show, using vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a relative of rabies virus transmitted by insect bites, that SCS macrophages perform a third vital function: they prevent lymph-borne neurotropic viruses from infecting the central nervous system (CNS). On local depletion of LN macrophages, about 60% of mice developed ascending paralysis and died 7-10 days after subcutaneous infection with a small dose of VSV, whereas macrophage-sufficient animals remained asymptomatic and cleared the virus. VSV gained access to the nervous system through peripheral nerves in macrophage-depleted LNs. In contrast, within macrophage-sufficient LNs VSV replicated preferentially in SCS macrophages but not in adjacent nerves. Removal of SCS macrophages did not compromise adaptive immune responses against VSV, but decreased type I interferon (IFN-I) production within infected LNs. VSV-infected macrophages recruited IFN-I-producing plasmacytoid dendritic cells to the SCS and in addition were a major source of IFN-I themselves. Experiments in bone marrow chimaeric mice revealed that IFN-I must act on both haematopoietic and stromal compartments, including the intranodal nerves, to prevent lethal infection with VSV. These results identify SCS macrophages as crucial gatekeepers to the CNS that prevent fatal viral invasion of the nervous system on peripheral infection.","[Iannacone, Matteo; Moseman, E.

Genetic evidence indicates that TRAF2 is necessary for the polyubiquitination of receptor interacting protein 1 (RIP1)(3) that then serves as a platform for recruitment and stimulation of I kappa B kinase, leading to activation of the transcription factor NF-kappa B. Although TRAF2 is a RING domain ubiquitin ligase, direct evidence that TRAF2 catalyses the ubiquitination of RIP1 is lacking. TRAF2 binds to sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1)(4), one of the isoenzymes that generates the pro-survival lipid mediator sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) inside cells. Here we show that SphK1 and the production of S1P is necessary for lysine-63-linked polyubiquitination of RIP1, phosphorylation of I kappa B kinase and I kappa B alpha, and I kappa B alpha degradation, leading to NF-kappa B activation. These responses were mediated by intracellular S1P independently of its cell surface G-protein-coupled receptors. S1P specifically binds to TRAF2 at the amino-terminal RING domain and stimulates its E3 ligase activity. S1P, but not dihydro-S1P, markedly increased recombinant TRAF2-catalysed lysine-63-linked, but not lysine-48-linked, polyubiquitination of RIP1 in vitro in the presence of the ubiquitin conjugating enzymes (E2) UbcH13 or UbcH5a. Our data show that TRAF2 is a novel intracellular target of S1P, and that S1P is the missing cofactor for TRAF2 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, indicating a new paradigm for the regulation of lysine-63-linked polyubiquitination. These results also highlight the key role of SphK1 and its product S1P in TNF-alpha signalling and the canonical NF-kappa B activation pathway important in inflammatory, antiapoptotic and immune processes.","[Alvarez, Sergio E.; Harikumar, Kuzhuvelil B.; Hait, Nitai C.; Allegood, Jeremy; Strub, Graham M.; Kim, Eugene Y.; Maceyka, Michael; Kordula, Tomasz; Milstien, Sheldon; Spiegel, Sarah] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, Sch Med, Richmond, VA 23298 USA; [Alvarez, Sergio E.; Harikumar, Kuzhuvelil B.; Hait, Nitai C.; Allegood, Jeremy; Strub, Graham M.; Kim, Eugene Y.; Maceyka, Michael; Kordula, Tomasz; Milstien, Sheldon; Spiegel, Sarah] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Massey Canc Ctr, Sch Med, Richmond, VA 23298 USA; [Jiang, Hualiang; Luo, Cheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Mat Med, State Key Lab Drug Res, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China","Spiegel, S (reprint author), Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, Sch Med, 1101 E Marshall St, Richmond, VA 23298 USA.",sspiegel@vcu.edu,,"Harikumar, KB/0000-0002-1763-4179","National Institute of Health [R37GM043880, R01CA61774, R01AI50094, U19AI077435]; Ministry of Scientific and Technology of China [2009CB918502]","We thank Z.

Autophagy has also been associated with cell death, but it is unclear how this is distinguished from autophagy during cell survival. Drosophila salivary glands undergo programmed cell death that requires autophagy genes(2), and engulfment of salivary gland cells by phagocytes does not appear to occur(3). Here we show that Draper (Drpr), the Drosophila melanogaster orthologue of the Caenorhabditis elegans engulfment receptor CED-1, is required for autophagy during cell death. Null mutations in, and salivary gland-specific knockdown of, drpr inhibit salivary gland degradation. Knockdown of drpr prevents the induction of autophagy in dying salivary glands, and expression of the Atg1 autophagy regulator in drpr mutants suppresses the failure in degradation of salivary glands. Surprisingly, drpr is required in the same dying salivary gland cells in which it regulates autophagy induction, but drpr knockdown does not prevent starvation-induced autophagy in the fat body, which is associated with survival. In addition, components of the conserved engulfment pathway are required for clearance of dying salivary glands. To our knowledge, this is the first example of an engulfment factor that is required for self-clearance of cells. Further, Drpr is the first factor that distinguishes autophagy that is associated with cell death from autophagy associated with cell survival.","[McPhee, Christina K.; Baehrecke, Eric H.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Canc Biol, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [McPhee, Christina K.] Univ Maryland, Dept Mol Genet & Cell Biol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Logan, Mary A.; Freeman, Marc R.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Freeman, Marc R.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Worcester, MA 01605 USA","Baehrecke, EH (reprint author), Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Canc Biol, Worcester, MA 01605 USA.",Eric.Baehrecke@umassmed.edu,,"Kary, Christina/0000-0002-2586-4185","American Cancer Society [PF-07-258-01-CSM]; NIH [NS053538, GM079431]; Merck and Co.

Many small regulatory RNAs are thought to function in nuclei(1,2). For instance, in plants and fungi, short interfering RNA (siRNAs) associate with nascent transcripts and direct chromatin and/or DNA modifications(1,2). To understand further the biological roles of small regulatory RNAs, we conducted a genetic screen to identify factors required for RNA interference (RNAi) in Caenorhabditis elegans nuclei(3). Here we show that the gene nuclear RNAi defective-2 (nrde-2) encodes an evolutionarily conserved protein that is required for siRNA-mediated silencing in nuclei. NRDE-2 associates with the Argonaute protein NRDE-3 within nuclei and is recruited by NRDE-3/siRNA complexes to nascent transcripts that have been targeted by RNAi. We find that nuclear-localized siRNAs direct an NRDE-2-dependent silencing of pre-messenger RNAs (pre-mRNAs) 3' to sites of RNAi, an NRDE-2-dependent accumulation of RNA polymerase (RNAP) II at genomic loci targeted by RNAi, and NRDE-2-dependent decreases in RNAP II occupancy and RNAP II transcriptional activity 39 to sites of RNAi. These results define NRDE-2 as a component of the nuclear RNAi machinery and demonstrate that metazoan siRNAs can silence nuclear-localized RNAs co-transcriptionally. In addition, these results establish a novel mode of RNAP II regulation: siRNA-directed recruitment of NRDE factors that inhibit RNAP II during the elongation phase of transcription.","[Guang, Shouhong; Bochner, Aaron F.; Burkhart, Kirk B.; Burton, Nick; Kennedy, Scott] Univ Wisconsin, Genet Lab, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Pavelec, Derek M.; Kennedy, Scott] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Pharmacol, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Kennedy, S (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Genet Lab, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",sgkennedy@wisc.edu,,,Pew and Shaw scholars programmes; National Institutes of Health; American Heart Association,"We thank P.

Assembly of this helical signalling tower is hierarchical, in which MyD88 recruits IRAK4 and the MyD88-IRAK4 complex recruits the IRAK4 substrates IRAK2 or the related IRAK1. Formation of these Myddosome complexes brings the kinase domains of IRAKs into proximity for phosphorylation and activation. Composite binding sites are required for recruitment of the individual DDs in the complex, which are confirmed by mutagenesis and previously identified signalling mutations. Specificities in Myddosome formation are dictated by both molecular complementarity and correspondence of surface electrostatics.

The biosynthesis of diphthamide was proposed to involve three steps, with the first being the formation of a C-C bond between the histidine residue and the 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl group of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM). However, further details of the biosynthesis remain unknown. Here we present structural and biochemical evidence showing that the first step of diphthamide biosynthesis in the archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii uses a novel iron-sulphur-cluster enzyme, Dph2. Dph2 is a homodimer and each of its monomers can bind a [4Fe-4S] cluster. Biochemical data suggest that unlike the enzymes in the radical SAM superfamily, Dph2 does not form the canonical 59-deoxyadenosyl radical. Instead, it breaks the Cc, Met-S bond of SAM and generates a 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl radical. Our results suggest that P. horikoshii Dph2 represents a previously unknown, SAM-dependent, [4Fe-4S]-containing enzyme that catalyses unprecedented chemistry.","[Zhang, Yang; Zhu, Xuling; Torelli, Andrew T.; Dzikovski, Boris; Koralewski, Rachel M.; Wang, Eileen; Freed, Jack; Ealick, Steven E.; Lin, Hening] Cornell Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Lee, Michael; Krebs, Carsten] Penn State Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Krebs, Carsten] Penn State Univ, Dept Chem, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Lin, HN (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",see3@cornell.edu; hl379@cornell.edu,"Krebs, Carsten/D-4773-2009","Krebs, Carsten/0000-0002-3302-7053","Dreyfus Foundation; NIH/NIGMS [R01GM088276]; NIH/NCRR [P41-RR016292]; US National Center for Research Resources at the US National Institutes of Health [RR-15301]; US Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-AC02-06CH11357]","We thank L.

Their small size and great distance make them difficult to study. KBO 55636 (2002 TX(300)) is a member of the water-ice-rich Haumea KBO collisional family(1). The Haumea family are among the most highly reflective objects in the Solar System. Dynamical calculations indicate that the collision that created KBO 55636 occurred at least 1 Gyr ago(2,3). Here we report observations of a multi-chord stellar occultation by KBO 55636, which occurred on 9 October 2009 UT. We find that it has a mean radius of 143 +/- 65 km (assuming a circular solution). Allowing for possible elliptical shapes, we find a geometric albedo of 0.88(0.06)(+0.15) in the V photometric band, which establishes that KBO 55636 is smaller than previously thought and that, like its parent body, it is highly reflective. The dynamical age implies either that KBO 55636 has an active resurfacing mechanism, or that fresh water-ice in the outer Solar System can persist for gigayear timescales.","[Elliot, J.

In the case of magnetic order, spins align parallel to each other in ferromagnets and antiparallel in antiferromagnets. In other, less conventional, cases, spins can sometimes form highly nontrivial structures called spin textures(4-23). Among them is the unusual, topologically stable skyrmion spin texture, in which the spins point in all the directions wrapping a sphere(4-7). The skyrmion configuration in a magnetic solid is anticipated to produce unconventional spin-electronic phenomena such as the topological Hall effect(24-26). The crystallization of skyrmions as driven by thermal fluctuations has recently been confirmed in a narrow region of the temperature/magnetic field (T-B) phase diagram in neutron scattering studies of the three-dimensional helical magnets MnSi (ref. 17) and Fe1-xCoxSi (ref. 22). Here we report real-space imaging of a two-dimensional skyrmion lattice in a thin film of Fe0.5Co0.5Si using Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. With a magnetic field of 50-70 mT applied normal to the film, we observe skyrmions in the form of a hexagonal arrangement of swirling spin textures, with a lattice spacing of 90 nm. The related T-B phase diagram is found to be in good agreement with Monte Carlo simulations. In this two-dimensional case, the skyrmion crystal seems very stable and appears over a wide range of the phase diagram, including near zero temperature. Such a controlled nanometre-scale spin topology in a thin film may be useful in observing unconventional magneto-transport effects.","[Yu, X.

Experimentally, coherence is usually established by synchronizing a subset of molecules in an ensemble(4-7) with ultra-short laser pulses(8). But in complex systems where even chemically identical molecules exist with different conformations and in diverse environments, the synchronized subset will have an intrinsic inhomogeneity that limits the degree of coherent control that can be achieved. A natural-and, indeed, the ultimate-solution to overcoming intrinsic inhomogeneities is the investigation of the behaviour of one molecule at a time. The single-molecule approach(9,10) has provided useful insights into phenomena as diverse as biomolecular interactions(11-13), cellular processes(14) and the dynamics of supercooled liquids(15) and conjugated polymers(16.) Coherent state preparation of single molecules has so far been restricted to cryogenic conditions(17), whereas at room temperature only incoherent vibrational relaxation pathways have been probed(18). Here we report the observation and manipulation of vibrational wave-packet interference in individual molecules at ambient conditions. We show that adapting the time and phase distribution of the optical excitation field to the dynamics of each molecule results in a high degree of control, and expect that the approach can be extended to achieve single-molecule coherent control in other complex inhomogeneous systems.","[Brinks, Daan; Stefani, Fernando D.; Kulzer, Florian; Hildner, Richard; Taminiau, Tim H.; Van Hulst, Niek F.] ICFO, Barcelona 08860, Spain; [Avlasevich, Yuri; Muellen, Klaus] Max Planck Inst Polymer Res, D-55128 Mainz, Germany; [Van Hulst, Niek F.] ICREA, Barcelona 08015, Spain","Stefani, FD (reprint author), ICFO, Mediterranean Technol Pk, Barcelona 08860, Spain.",Fernando.Stefani@df.uba.ar; Niek.vanHulst@ICFO.es,"Taminiau, Tim Hugo/A-8094-2008; Stefani, Fernando/I-9229-2012; van Hulst, Niek/J-2121-2012; Hildner, Richard/O-6386-2014","Taminiau, Tim Hugo/0000-0002-2355-727X; Stefani, Fernando/0000-0001-5120-2356; van Hulst, Niek/0000-0003-4630-1776; Hildner, Richard/0000-0002-7282-3730; Stefani, Fernando/0000-0002-3277-7215","Koerber foundation (Hamburg); Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [CSD2007-046-NanoLight.es, MAT2006-08184]; ICREA",We thank P.

SO2 is oxidized to sulphate and can subsequently form sulphate aerosol(3), which can affect the Earth's radiation balance, biologic productivity and high-altitude ozone concentrations, as is evident from recent volcanic eruptions(4). SO2 oxidation can occur via several different pathways that depend on its flux and the atmospheric conditions(3). An investigation into how SO2 is oxidized to sulphate-the oxidation product preserved in the rock record-can therefore shed light on past volcanic eruptions and atmospheric conditions. Here we use sulphur and triple oxygen isotope measurements of atmospheric sulphate extracted from tuffaceous deposits to investigate the specific oxidation pathways from which the sulphate was formed. We find that seven eruption-related sulphate aerosol deposition events have occurred during the mid-Cenozoic era (34 to 7 million years ago) in the northern High Plains, North America. Two extensively sampled ash beds display a similar sulphate mixing pattern that has two distinct atmospheric secondary sulphates. A three-dimensional atmospheric sulphur chemistry and transport model study reveals that the observed, isotopically discrete sulphates in sediments can be produced only in initially alkaline cloudwater that favours an ozone-dominated SO2 oxidation pathway in the troposphere. Our finding suggests that, in contrast to the weakly acidic conditions today(5), cloudwater in the northern High Plains may frequently have been alkaline during the mid-Cenozoic era. We propose that atmospheric secondary sulphate preserved in continental deposits represents an unexploited geological archive for atmospheric SO2 oxidation chemistry linked to volcanism and atmospheric conditions in the past.","[Bao, Huiming] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Yu, Shaocai] US EPA, Natl Exposure Res Lab, Atmospher Modeling & Anal Div E243 03, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27711 USA; [Tong, Daniel Q.] NOAA, Air Resources Lab, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA","Bao, HM (reprint author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",bao@lsu.edu; yu.shaocai@epa.gov,"Tong, Daniel/A-8255-2008; Bao, Huiming/C-1069-2012; yu, shaocai/G-7806-2011; yu, shaocai/F-1394-2014","Tong, Daniel/0000-0002-4255-4568; ",NSF [EAR-0408986]; United States Environmental Protection Agency through its Office of Research and Development,"H.

A relationship between the two is widely acknowledged but its precise nature has eluded geoscientists and remained controversial. Largely on the basis of detailed observations from the North Atlantic Ocean, mantle temperature was identified as the primary factor controlling magmatic production 1, with most authors seeking to explain observed variations in volcanic activity at rifted margins in terms of the mantle temperature at the time of break-up(2,3). However, as more detailed observations have been made at other rifted margins worldwide, the validity of this interpretation and the importance of other factors in controlling break-up style have been much debated(4-7). One such observation is from the northwest Indian Ocean, where, despite an unequivocal link between an onshore flood basalt province, continental break-up and a hot-spot track leading to an active ocean island volcano, the associated continental margins show little magmatism(5,8). Here we reconcile these observations by applying a numerical model that accounts explicitly for the effects of earlier episodes of extension. Our approach allows us to directly compare break-up magmatism generated at different locations and so isolate the key controlling factors. We show that the volume of rift-related magmatism generated, both in the northwest Indian Ocean and at the better-known North Atlantic margins, depends not only on the mantle temperature but, to a similar degree, on the rift history. The inherited extensional history can either suppress or enhance melt generation, which can explain previously enigmatic observations.","[Armitage, John J.; Collier, Jenny S.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Earth Sci & Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Minshull, Tim A.] Univ Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England","Armitage, JJ (reprint author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Earth Sci & Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England.",j.armitage@imperial.ac.uk,"Minshull, Timothy/D-1147-2010; Armitage, John/E-9265-2017","Minshull, Timothy/0000-0002-8202-1379; Armitage, John/0000-0003-2806-8181",UK Natural Environment Research Council,"We are grateful to J.

Because the phenotypic traits regulating species interactions are largely a legacy of their ancestors, it is widely assumed that ecological interactions are phylogenetically conserved, with closely related species interacting with similar partners(2). However, the existing empirical evidence is inadequate to appropriately evaluate the hypothesis of phylogenetic conservatism in ecological interactions, because it is both ecologically and taxonomically biased. In fact, most studies on the evolution of ecological interactions have focused on specialized organisms, such as some parasites or insect herbivores(3-7), belonging to a limited subset of the overall tree of life. Here we study the evolution of host use in a large and diverse group of interactions comprising both specialist and generalist acellular, unicellular and multicellular organisms. We show that, as previously found for specialized interactions, generalized interactions can be evolutionarily conserved. Significant phylogenetic conservatism of interaction patterns was equally likely to occur in symbiotic and non-symbiotic interactions, as well as in mutualistic and antagonistic interactions. Host-use differentiation among species was higher in phylogenetically conserved clades, irrespective of their generalization degree and taxonomic position within the tree of life. Our findings strongly suggest a shared pattern in the organization of biological systems through evolutionary time, mediated by marked conservatism of ecological interactions among taxa.","[Gomez, Jose M.] Univ Granada, Dept Ecol, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Verdu, Miguel] Univ Valencia Generalitat Valenciana, CSIC, Ctr Invest Desertificac, E-46470 Valencia, Spain; [Perfectti, Francisco] Univ Granada, Dept Genet, E-18071 Granada, Spain","Gomez, JM (reprint author), Univ Granada, Dept Ecol, E-18071 Granada, Spain.",jmgreyes@ugr.es,"Perfectti, Francisco/C-5087-2008; Verdu, Miguel/C-4461-2008; Gomez, Jose/K-8061-2017","Perfectti, Francisco/0000-0002-5551-213X; Verdu, Miguel/0000-0002-9778-7692; ",Spanish Ministry of Science; Junta de Andalucia,"We thank J.

However, it is not known whether these restrictions impose a global limit on how far homologous protein sequences can diverge from each other. Here we explore the limits of protein evolution using sequence divergence data. We formulate a computational approach to study the rate of divergence of distant protein sequences and measure this rate for ancient proteins, those that were present in the last universal common ancestor. We show that ancient proteins are still diverging from each other, indicating an ongoing expansion of the protein sequence universe. The slow rate of this divergence is imposed by the sparseness of functional protein sequences in sequence space and the ruggedness of the protein fitness landscape: similar to 98 per cent of sites cannot accept an amino-acid substitution at any given moment but a vast majority of all sites may eventually be permitted to evolve when other, compensatory, changes occur. Thus, similar to 3.5 x 10(9) yr has not been enough to reach the limit of divergent evolution of proteins, and for most proteins the limit of sequence similarity imposed by common function may not exceed that of random sequences.","[Povolotskaya, Inna S.; Kondrashov, Fyodor A.] Ctr Genom Regulat, Bioinformat & Genom Programme, Barcelona 08003, Spain","Kondrashov, FA (reprint author), Ctr Genom Regulat, Bioinformat & Genom Programme, Calle Dr Aiguader 88,Barcelona Biomed Res Pk Bldg, Barcelona 08003, Spain.",fyodor.kondrashov@crg.es,"Kondrashov, Fyodor Alexeevich/H-6331-2015","Kondrashov, Fyodor Alexeevich/0000-0001-8243-4694; Povolotskaya, Inna/0000-0001-6621-232X",,,,36,86,89,2,21,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Jun,2010,465,7300,,,,,922,U7,,10.1038/nature09105,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,611HN,WOS:000278804500037,20485343.0,No,,,11/20/17,fyodor a.,kondrashov,na,na,na,na,na

Such refinement may be attributed to the pruning of non-optimal excitatory inputs, reshaping of the excitatory tuning profile through modifying the strengths of individual inputs, or strengthening of cortical inhibition. These models have not been directly tested because of the technical difficulties in assaying the spatiotemporal patterns of functional synaptic inputs during development. Here we apply in vivo whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings to the recipient layer 4 neurons in the rat primary auditory cortex (A1) to determine the developmental changes in the frequency-intensity tonal receptive fields (TRFs) of their excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Surprisingly, we observe co-tuned excitation and inhibition immediately after the onset of hearing, suggesting that a tripartite thalamocortical circuit with relatively strong feedforward inhibition is formed independently of auditory experience. The frequency ranges of tone-driven excitatory and inhibitory inputs first expand within a few days of the onset of hearing and then persist into adulthood. The latter phase is accompanied by a sharpening of the excitatory but not inhibitory frequency tuning profile, which results in relatively broader inhibitory tuning in adult A1 neurons. Thus the development of cortical synaptic TRFs after the onset of hearing is marked by a slight breakdown of previously formed excitation-inhibition balance. Our results suggest that functional refinement of cortical TRFs does not require a selective pruning of inputs, but may depend more on a fine adjustment of excitatory input strengths.","[Sun, Yujiao J.; Wu, Guangying K.; Liu, Bao-hua; Li, Pingyang; Zhou, Mu; Tao, Huizhong W.; Zhang, Li I.] Univ So Calif, Keck Sch Med, Zilkha Neurogenet Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Zhang, Li I.] Univ So Calif, Keck Sch Med, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Tao, Huizhong W.] Univ So Calif, Keck Sch Med, Dept Cell & Neurobiol, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Xiao, Zhongju] So Med Univ, Sch Basic Med Sci, Dept Physiol, Guangzhou 510515, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Zhang, LI (reprint author), Univ So Calif, Keck Sch Med, Zilkha Neurogenet Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",htao@usc.edu; liizhang@usc.edu,"Wu, Guangying/E-8117-2010; Sun, Yujiao/E-5668-2015; Zhou, Mu/K-8137-2016","Zhou, Mu/0000-0001-5326-4884; Sun, Yujiao Jennifer/0000-0003-2437-2936","US National Institutes of Health/National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders [R01DC008983, R21DC008588]; Searle Scholar Program; Klingenstein Foundation; David and Lucile Packard Foundation; US National Institutes of Health [EY018718, EY019049]; Karl Kirchgessner Foundation; National Natural Science Foundation of China [30730039, 30970982, 30670665]","We thank J.R.

The organization of the primary auditory cortex (A1) in particular is governed by acoustic experience during the critical period, an epoch near the beginning of postnatal development throughout which cortical synapses and networks are especially plastic(1-8). This neonatal sensitivity to the pattern of sensory inputs is believed to be essential for constructing stable and adequately adapted representations of the auditory world and for the acquisition of language skills by children(5,9,10). One important principle of synaptic organization in mature brains is the balance between excitation and inhibition, which controls receptive field structure and spatiotemporal flow of neural activity(11-15), but it is unknown how and when this excitatory-inhibitory balance is initially established and calibrated. Here we use whole-cell recording to determine the processes underlying the development of synaptic receptive fields in rat A1. We find that, immediately after the onset of hearing, sensory-evoked excitatory and inhibitory responses are equally strong, although inhibition is less stimulus-selective and mismatched with excitation. However, during the third week of postnatal development, excitation and inhibition become highly correlated. Patterned sensory stimulation drives coordinated synaptic changes across receptive fields, rapidly improves excitatory-inhibitory coupling and prevents further exposure-induced modifications. Thus, the pace of cortical synaptic receptive field development is set by progressive, experience-dependent refinement of intracortical inhibition.","[Dorrn, Anja L.; Yuan, Kexin; Barker, Alison J.; Schreiner, Christoph E.; Froemke, Robert C.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Coleman Mem Lab, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Dorrn, Anja L.; Yuan, Kexin; Barker, Alison J.; Schreiner, Christoph E.; Froemke, Robert C.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Coleman Mem Lab, WM Keck Fdn Ctr Integrat Neurosci, Neurosci Grad Program,Dept Otolaryngol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Dorrn, Anja L.] Max Delbruck Ctr Mol Med, Dept Neurosci, D-13125 Berlin, Germany; [Dorrn, Anja L.] NeuroCure Neurosci Res Ctr NWFZ, D-13125 Berlin, Germany; [Froemke, Robert C.] NYU, Sch Med, Mol Neurobiol Program, Helen & Martin Kimmel Ctr Biol & Med, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Froemke, Robert C.] NYU, Sch Med, Skirball Inst Biomol Med, Dept Otolaryngol, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Froemke, Robert C.] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Physiol, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Froemke, Robert C.] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, New York, NY 10016 USA","Froemke, RC (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Coleman Mem Lab, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",robert.froemke@med.nyu.edu,,"Schreiner, Christoph/0000-0002-4571-4328; Froemke, Robert/0000-0002-1230-6811","National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders [K99/R00]; Silvio O.

However, regimens used to treat many such conditions cannot maintain disease control in the majority of SLE patients and more aggressive approaches such as high-dose methylprednisolone pulse therapy are used to provide transient reductions in disease activity(3,4). The primary anti-inflammatory mechanism of glucocorticoids is thought to be NF-kappa B inhibition(5). Recognition of self nucleic acids by toll-like receptors TLR7 and TLR9 on B cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs) is an important step in the pathogenesis of SLE(6), promoting anti-nuclear antibodies and the production of type I interferon (IFN), both correlated with the severity of disease(1,7). Following their activation by self-nucleic acid-associated immune complexes, PDCs migrate to the tissues(8,9). We demonstrate, in vitro and in vivo, that stimulation of PDCs through TLR7 and 9 can account for the reduced activity of glucocorticoids to inhibit the IFN pathway in SLE patients and in two lupus-prone mouse strains. The triggering of PDCs through TLR7 and 9 by nucleic acid-containing immune complexes or by synthetic ligands activates the NF-kappa B pathway essential for PDC survival. Glucocorticoids do not affect NF-kappa B activation in PDCs, preventing glucocorticoid induction of PDC death and the consequent reduction of systemic IFN-alpha levels. These findings unveil a new role for self nucleic acid recognition by TLRs and indicate that inhibitors of TLR7 and 9 signalling could prove to be effective corticosteroid-sparing drugs.","[Guiducci, Cristiana; Gong, Mei; Meeker, Thea; Chan, Jean H.; Coffman, Robert L.; Barrat, Franck J.] Dynavax Technol Corp, Berkeley, CA 94710 USA; [Xu, Zhaohui; Gill, Michelle; Chaussabel, Damien; Banchereau, Jacques; Pascual, Virginia] Baylor Inst Immunol Res, Dallas, TX 75204 USA; [Wright, Tracey; Punaro, Marilynn; Pascual, Virginia] Texas Scottish Rite Hosp Children, Dallas, TX 75219 USA; [Wright, Tracey; Punaro, Marilynn] Univ Texas Dallas, SW Med Ctr, Dallas, TX 75235 USA; [Wright, Tracey; Punaro, Marilynn] Childrens Med Ctr, Dallas, TX 75235 USA; [Bolland, Silvia] NIAID, Immunogenet Lab, NIH, Rockville, MD 20852 USA; [Soumelis, Vassili] Inst Curie, Dept Immunol, F-75005 Paris, France","Barrat, FJ (reprint author), Dynavax Technol Corp, 2929 7th St,Suite 100, Berkeley, CA 94710 USA.",fbarrat@dynavax.com,,"Xu, Zhaohui/0000-0003-0645-1737; Chaussabel, Damien/0000-0002-6131-7242","NIH [P50-ARO54083-01CORT, U19-AI082715-01]; Alliance for Lupus Research; Mary Kirkland Foundation; SBIR [2R44AI066483-02]","We would like to thank A.

During starvation, the protein TOR (target of rapamycin), a nutrient-responsive kinase, is inhibited, and this induces autophagy. In autophagy, double-membrane autophagosomes envelop and sequester intracellular components and then fuse with lysosomes to form autolysosomes, which degrade their contents to regenerate nutrients. Current models of autophagy terminate with the degradation of the autophagosome cargo in autolysosomes(3-5), but the regulation of autophagy in response to nutrients and the subsequent fate of the autolysosome are poorly understood. Here we show that mTOR signalling in rat kidney cells is inhibited during initiation of autophagy, but reactivated by prolonged starvation. Reactivation of mTOR is autophagy-dependent and requires the degradation of autolysosomal products. Increased mTOR activity attenuates autophagy and generates proto-lysosomal tubules and vesicles that extrude from autolysosomes and ultimately mature into functional lysosomes, thereby restoring the full complement of lysosomes in the cell-a process we identify in multiple animal species. Thus, an evolutionarily conserved cycle in autophagy governs nutrient sensing and lysosome homeostasis during starvation.","[Yu, Li; Zheng, Lixin; Liu, Zhihua; Wan, Fengyi; Lenardo, Michael J.] NIAID, Immunol Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Yu, Li; Rong, Yueguang; Peng, Junya; Mi, Na] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Life Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Yu, Li; Rong, Yueguang; Peng, Junya; Mi, Na] State Key Lab Biomembrane & Membrane Biotechnol, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [McPhee, Christina K.; Baehrecke, Eric H.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Canc Biol, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [McPhee, Christina K.] Univ Maryland, Dept Mol Genet & Cell Biol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Mardones, Gonzalo A.; Hailey, Dale W.] NICHHD, Cell Biol & Metab Program, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Mardones, Gonzalo A.] Univ Austral Chile, Dept Physiol, Valdivia 5099200, Chile; [Zhao, Ying] Peking Univ, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Oorschot, Viola; Klumperman, Judith] Univ Med Ctr Utrecht, Dept Cell Biol, NL-3584 CX Utrecht, Netherlands","Lenardo, MJ (reprint author), NIAID, Immunol Lab, NIH, Bldg 10, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",lenardo@nih.gov,,"Kary, Christina/0000-0002-2586-4185","Division of Intramural Research of the NIAID, NIH, Department of Health and Human Services; NIH [GM079431]; 973 program [2010CB833704]; NSF [20091300700]; Tsinghua University [20091081391]; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) [918.56.611]","We thank the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) imaging core facility and Olympus China for technical support; O.

The release factors are highly specific for a U in the first stop-codon position 1 and recognize different combinations of purines in the second and third positions, with RF1 reading UAA and UAG and RF2 reading UAA and UGA. With recently determined crystal structures of termination complexes(2-4), it has become possible to decipher the energetics of stop-codon reading by computational analysis and to clarify the origin of the high release-factor binding accuracy. Here we report molecular dynamics free-energy calculations on different cognate and non-cognate termination complexes. The simulations quantitatively explain the basic principles of decoding in all three codon positions and reveal the key elements responsible for specificity of the release factors. The overall reading mechanism involves hitherto unidentified interactions and recognition switches that cannot be described in terms of a tripeptide anticodon model. Further simulations of complexes with tRNA(Trp), the tRNA recognizing the triplet codon for Trp, explain the observation of a 'leaky' stop codon 5 and highlight the fundamentally different third position reading by RF2, which leads to a high stop-codon specificity with strong discrimination against the Trp codon.

In eukaryotes, damage bypass is activated by ubiquitylation of the replication clamp PCNA through components of the RAD6 pathway(2). Whereas monoubiquitylation of PCNA allows mutagenic translesion synthesis by damage-tolerant DNA polymerases(3-5), polyubiquitylation is required for an error-free pathway that probably involves a template switch to the undamaged sister chromatid(6). Both the timing of PRR events during the cell cycle and their location relative to replication forks, as well as the factors required downstream of PCNA ubiquitylation, have remained poorly characterized. Here we demonstrate that the RAD6 pathway normally operates during S phase. However, using an inducible system of DNA damage bypass in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), we show that the process is separable in time and space from genome replication, thus allowing direct visualization and quantification of productive PRR tracts. We found that both during and after S phase ultraviolet-radiation-induced lesions are bypassed predominantly via translesion synthesis, whereas the error-free pathway functions as a backup system. Our approach has revealed the distribution of PRR tracts in a synchronized cell population. It will allow an in-depth mechanistic analysis of how cells manage the processing of lesions to their genomes during and after replication.","[Daigaku, Yasukazu; Davies, Adelina A.; Ulrich, Helle D.] Canc Res UK London Res Inst, Clare Hall Labs, S Mimms EN6 3LD, Herts, England","Ulrich, HD (reprint author), Canc Res UK London Res Inst, Clare Hall Labs, Blanche Lane, S Mimms EN6 3LD, Herts, England.",helle.ulrich@cancer.org.uk,,"Ulrich, Helle/0000-0003-0431-2223",Cancer Research UK,We thank O.

In TFIID-dependent activation pathways, this general transcription factor containing TATA-box-binding protein is first recruited on the promoter through interaction with activators(1-3) and cooperates with TFIIA to form a committed pre-initiation complex(4). However, neither the mechanisms by which activation signals are communicated between these factors nor the structural organization of the activated pre-initiation complex are known. Here we used cryo-electron microscopy to determine the architecture of nucleoprotein complexes composed of TFIID, TFIIA, the transcriptional activator Rap1 and yeast enhancer-promoter DNA. These structures revealed the mode of binding of Rap1 and TFIIA to TFIID, as well as a reorganization of TFIIA induced by its interaction with Rap1. We propose that this change in position increases the exposure of TATA-box-binding protein within TFIID, consequently enhancing its ability to interact with the promoter. A large Rap1-dependent DNA loop forms between the activator-binding site and the proximal promoter region. This loop is topologically locked by a TFIIA-Rap1 protein bridge that folds over the DNA. These results highlight the role of TFIIA in transcriptional activation, define a molecular mechanism for enhancer-promoter communication and provide structural insights into the pathways of intramolecular communication that convey transcription activation signals through the TFIID complex.","[Papai, Gabor; Ruhlmann, Christine; Schultz, Patrick] IGBMC, Dept Struct Biol & Genom, F-67404 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France; [Papai, Gabor; Ruhlmann, Christine; Schultz, Patrick] CNRS, UMR7104, F-67400 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France; [Papai, Gabor; Ruhlmann, Christine; Schultz, Patrick] INSERM, U964, F-67400 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France; [Papai, Gabor; Ruhlmann, Christine; Schultz, Patrick] Univ Strasbourg, F-67000 Strasbourg, France; [Tripathi, Manish K.; Layer, Justin H.; Weil, P.

ICDH inactivation short-circuits the Krebs cycle by enabling the glyoxlate bypass(2,3). It was the discovery of AceK and ICDH that established the existence of protein phosphorylation regulation in prokaryotes(1,4). As a 65-kDa protein, AceK is significantly larger than typical eukaryotic protein kinases. Apart from the ATP-binding motif, AceK does not share sequence homology with any eukaryotic protein kinase or phosphatase(5,6). Most intriguingly, AceK possesses the two opposing activities of protein kinase and phosphatase within one protein, and specifically recognizes only intact ICDH(7,8). Additionally, AceK has strong ATPase activity(9). It has been shown that AceK kinase, phosphatase and ATPase activities reside at the same site(6,10), although the molecular basis of such multifunctionality and its regulation remains completely unknown. Here we report the structures of AceK and its complex with ICDH. The AceK structure reveals a eukaryotic protein-kinase-like domain containing ATP and a regulatory domain with a novel fold. As an AceK phosphatase activator and kinase inhibitor, AMP is found to bind in an allosteric site between the two AceK domains. An AMP-mediated conformational change exposes and shields ATP, acting as a switch between AceK kinase and phosphatase activities, and ICDH-binding induces further conformational change for AceK activation. The substrate recognition loop of AceK binds to the ICDH dimer, allowing higher-order substrate recognition and interaction, and inducing critical conformational change at the phosphorylation site of ICDH.","[Zheng, Jimin; Jia, Zongchao] Queens Univ, Dept Biochem, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada; [Zheng, Jimin] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Chem, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China","Jia, ZC (reprint author), Queens Univ, Dept Biochem, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.",jia@queensu.ca,,,Canadian Institutes of Health Research,"The authors would like to thank M.

In addition, the finding that there is partial epigenetic stability in somatic and germline cells allows insight into the molecular mechanisms of heritability.

Here we describe the crystal structure of the Tat center dot P-TEFb complex containing HIV-1 Tat, human Cdk9 (also known as CDK9), and human cyclin T1 (also known as CCNT1). Tat adopts a structure complementary to the surface of P-TEFb and makes extensive contacts, mainly with the cyclin T1 subunit of P-TEFb, but also with the T-loop of the Cdk9 subunit. The structure provides a plausible explanation for the tolerance of Tat to sequence variations at certain sites. Importantly, Tat induces significant conformational changes in P-TEFb.

A population of Saturn's small moons orbiting just outside the main rings are dynamically young(5,6) (less than 10(7) yr old), which is inconsistent with the formation timescale for the regular satellites. They are also underdense(7) (similar to 600 kgm(-3)) and show spectral characteristics similar to those of the main rings(8,9). It has been suggested that they accreted at the rings' edge(7,10,11), but hitherto it has been impossible to model the formation process fully owing to a lack of computational power. Here we report a hybrid simulation in which the viscous spreading of Saturn's rings beyond the Roche limit (the distance beyond which the rings are gravitationally unstable) gives rise to the small moons. The moonlets' mass distribution and orbital architecture are reproduced. The current confinement of the main rings and the existence of the dusty F ring are shown to be direct consequences of the coupling of viscous evolution and satellite formation.

Scaling such experiments into the quantum domain with one (or just a few) particles of light and matter will allow for the implementation of quantum computing protocols with atoms and photons(4-7), or the realization of strongly interacting photon gases exhibiting quantum phase transitions of light(8,9). Reaching these aims is challenging and requires an enhanced matter-light interaction, as provided by cavity quantum electrodynamics(10-12). Here we demonstrate EIT with a single atom quasi-permanently trapped inside a high-finesse optical cavity. The atom acts as a quantum-optical transistor with the ability to coherently control(13) the transmission of light through the cavity. We investigate the scaling of EIT when the atom number is increased one-by-one. The measured spectra are in excellent agreement with a theoretical model.

When a bubble on a liquid-gas or solid-gas interface (referred to herein as an interfacial bubble) ruptures, the general expectation is that the bubble vanishes. More precisely, the ruptured thin film is expected to retract rapidly until it becomes part of the interface, an event that typically occurs within milliseconds(4-6). The assumption that ruptured bubbles vanish is central to theories on foam evolution(7) and relevant to health(8) and climate(9) because bubble rupture is a source for aerosol droplets(10,11). Here we show that for a large range of fluid parameters, interfacial bubbles can create numerous small bubbles when they rupture, rather than vanishing. We demonstrate, both experimentally and numerically, that the curved film of the ruptured bubble can fold and entrap air as it retracts. The resulting toroidal geometry of the trapped air is unstable, leading to the creation of a ring of smaller bubbles. The higher pressure associated with the higher curvature of the smaller bubbles increases the absorption of gas into the liquid, and increases the efficiency of rupture-induced aerosol dispersal.","[Bird, James C.; de Ruiter, Rielle; Stone, Howard A.] Harvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Courbin, Laurent] Univ Rennes 1, CNRS, UMR 6251, Inst Phys Rennes, F-35042 Rennes, France; [Stone, Howard A.] Princeton Univ, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Bird, JC (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",jbird@fas.harvard.edu; hastone@princeton.edu,"Courbin, Laurent/E-4880-2010","Courbin, Laurent/0000-0003-1210-0597",NSF via the Harvard MRSEC,"We thank P.

However, studying the inner workings of atoms and molecules on the electronic timescale(1-4) has become possible only with the recent development of isolated attosecond (10(-18)-s) laser pulses(5). Such pulses have been used to investigate atomic photoexcitation and photoionization(6,7) and electron dynamics in solids(8), and in molecules could help explore the prompt charge redistribution and localization that accompany photoexcitation processes. In recent work, the dissociative ionization of H(2) and D(2) was monitored on femtosecond timescales(9) and controlled using few-cycle near-infrared laser pulses(10). Here we report a molecular attosecond pump-probe experiment based on that work: H(2) and D(2) are dissociatively ionized by a sequence comprising an isolated attosecond ultraviolet pulse and an intense few-cycle infrared pulse, and a localization of the electronic charge distribution within the molecule is measured that depends-with attosecond time resolution-on the delay between the pump and probe pulses. The localization occurs by means of two mechanisms, where the infrared laser influences the photoionization or the dissociation of the molecular ion. In the first case, charge localization arises from quantum mechanical interference involving autoionizing states and the laser-altered wavefunction of the departing electron. In the second case, charge localization arises owing to laser-driven population transfer between different electronic states of the molecular ion. These results establish attosecond pump-probe strategies as a powerful tool for investigating the complex molecular dynamics that result from the coupling between electronic and nuclear motions beyond the usual Born-Oppenheimer approximation.","[Kelkensberg, F.; Siu, W.; Ghafur, O.; Johnsson, P.; Vrakking, M.

Recently it has been proposed(1) that the age of the Earth deduced from lead isotopes reflects volatile loss to space at the time of the Moon-forming giant impact rather than partitioning into metallic liquids during protracted core formation. Here we show that lead partitioning into liquid iron depends strongly on carbon content and that, given a content of similar to 0.2% carbon(2,3), experimental and isotopic data both provide evidence of strong partitioning of lead into the core throughout the Earth's accretion. Earlier conclusions that lead is weakly partitioned into iron arose from the use of carbon-saturated (about 5% C) iron alloys. The lead isotopic age of the Earth is therefore consistent with partitioning into the core and with no significant late losses of moderately volatile elements to space during the giant impact.","[Wood, Bernard J.; Halliday, Alex N.] Univ Oxford, Dept Earth Sci, Oxford OX1 3PR, England; [Wood, Bernard J.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia","Wood, BJ (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Dept Earth Sci, Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PR, England.",berniew@earth.ox.ac.uk,"Wood, Bernard/E-8173-2010; GAU, geochemist/H-1985-2016",,Australian Research Council [FF 0456999]; NERC (UK) [NE/F018266/1]; STFC; EU [505320],"The assistance of N.

At the end of the Pleistocene epoch about 11,700 years ago, North American communities were substantially altered by the interplay of two events. The climate shifted from the cold, arid Last Glacial Maximum to the warm, mesic Holocene interglacial, causing many mammal species to shift their geographic distributions substantially(2,3). Populations were further stressed as humans arrived on the continent(4). The resulting megafaunal extinction event, in which 70 of the roughly 220 largest mammals in North America (32%) became extinct 5, has received much attention. However, responses of small mammals to events at the end of the Pleistocene have been much less studied, despite the sensitivity of these animals to current and future environmental change. Here we examine community changes in small mammals in northern California during the last 'natural' global warming event at the Pleistocene-Holocene transition and show that even though no small mammals in the local community became extinct, species losses and gains, combined with changes in abundance, caused declines in both the evenness and richness of communities. Modern mammalian communities are thus depauperate not only as a result of megafaunal extinctions at the end of the Pleistocene but also because of diversity loss among small mammals. Our results suggest that across future landscapes there will be some unanticipated effects of global change on diversity: restructuring of small mammal communities, significant loss of richness, and perhaps the rising dominance of native 'weedy' species.","[Blois, Jessica L.; Hadly, Elizabeth A.] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [McGuire, Jenny L.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Blois, JL (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Climat Res, 1225 W Dayton St, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",blois@wisc.edu,"Blois, Jessica/G-5893-2011; McGuire, Jenny/G-8819-2011","Blois, Jessica/0000-0003-4048-177X; McGuire, Jenny/0000-0002-0663-6902","National Science Foundation [EAR-0545648, EAR-0719429]; California Energy Commission; Stanford University Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education; US Forest Service","We thank numerous field assistants, A.

Modest effects have been reported in some studies of older individuals(2,3) and preschool children(4), and video-game players outperform non-players on some tests of visual attention(5). However, the widely held belief that commercially available computerized brain-training programs improve general cognitive function in the wider population in our opinion lacks empirical support. The central question is not whether performance on cognitive tests can be improved by training, but rather, whether those benefits transfer to other untrained tasks or lead to any general improvement in the level of cognitive functioning. Here we report the results of a six-week online study in which 11,430 participants trained several times each week on cognitive tasks designed to improve reasoning, memory, planning, visuospatial skills and attention. Although improvements were observed in every one of the cognitive tasks that were trained, no evidence was found for transfer effects to untrained tasks, even when those tasks were cognitively closely related.","[Owen, Adrian M.; Hampshire, Adam; Grahn, Jessica A.] MRC Cognit & Brain Sci Unit, Cambridge CB2 7EF, England; [Stenton, Robert; Dajani, Said; Howard, Robert J.; Ballard, Clive G.] Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat, London SE5 8AF, England; [Burns, Alistair S.] Univ Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Burns, Alistair S.] Manchester Acad Hlth Sci Ctr, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England","Owen, AM (reprint author), MRC Cognit & Brain Sci Unit, 15 Chaucer Rd, Cambridge CB2 7EF, England.",adrian.owen@mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk,"Grahn, Jessica/A-1371-2010; Howard, Robert/E-4890-2010; Owen, Adrian/B-4997-2015","Grahn, Jessica/0000-0001-7270-2114; Burns, Alistair/0000-0002-9837-0645; Ballard, Clive/0000-0003-0022-5632","Medical Research Council [U.1055.01.002.00001.01, U.1055.01.003.00001.01]; Alzheimer's Society (UK)","A.M.O., A.

SaPI DNA is then efficiently encapsidated in phage-like infectious particles, leading to extremely high frequencies of intra-as well as intergeneric transfer(1-3). In the absence of helper phage lytic growth, the island is maintained in a quiescent prophage-like state by a global repressor, Stl, which controls expression of most of the SaPI genes(4). Here we show that SaPI derepression is effected by a specific, non-essential phage protein that binds to Stl, disrupting the Stl-DNA complex and thereby initiating the excision-replication-packaging cycle of the island. Because SaPIs require phage proteins to be packaged(5,6), this strategy assures that SaPIs will be transferred once induced. Several different SaPIs are induced by helper phage 80 alpha and, in each case, the SaPI commandeers a different non-essential phage protein for its derepression. The highly specific interactions between different SaPI repressors and helper-phage-encoded anti-repressors represent a remarkable evolutionary adaptation involved in pathogenicity island mobilization.","[Angeles Tormo-Mas, Maria; Mir, Ignacio; Penades, Jose R.] Inst Valenciano Invest Agr, CITA, Segorbe 12400, Castellon, Spain; [Shrestha, Archana; Tallent, Sandra M.; Christie, Gail E.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Sch Med, Richmond, VA 23298 USA; [Campoy, Susana; Barbe, Jordi] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Genet & Microbiol, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Lasa, Inigo] Univ Publ Navarra, CSIC, Inst Agrobiotecnol, Navarra 31006, Spain; [Novick, Richard P.] NYU, Med Ctr, Skirball Inst Program Mol Pathogenesis, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Novick, Richard P.] NYU, Med Ctr, Dept Microbiol, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Novick, Richard P.] NYU, Med Ctr, Dept Med, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Penades, Jose R.] Univ Cardenal Herrera CEU, Dept Quim Bioquim & Biol Mol, Valencia 46113, Spain","Penades, JR (reprint author), Inst Valenciano Invest Agr, CITA, Apdo 187, Segorbe 12400, Castellon, Spain.",penades_jos@gva.es,"campoy, susana/E-4346-2010; Lasa, Inigo/F-2947-2011; Tormo Mas, Maria Angeles/K-5085-2014; Barbe, Jordi/G-5212-2015; Mir Sanchis, Ignacio/L-6759-2016; Campoy, Susana/C-7335-2008","campoy, susana/0000-0003-1369-0197; Lasa, Inigo/0000-0002-6625-9221; Tormo Mas, Maria Angeles/0000-0001-8928-2697; Barbe, Jordi/0000-0003-4408-013X; Mir Sanchis, Ignacio/0000-0002-6536-0045; Campoy, Susana/0000-0003-1369-0197","Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion (MICINN) [CSD2009-00006, BIO2005-08399-C02-02, BIO2008-05284-C02-02, BIO2008-00642-E/C, BFU2008-01078]; Cardenal Herrera-CEU University [PRCEU-UCH25/08]; Conselleria de Agricultura, Pesca i Alimentacio (CAPiA); Generalitat Valenciana [ACOMP07/258]; Generalitat de Catalunya [2009SGR1106]; NIH [R21AI067654, R01AI022159-23A2]; A.

An imbalance in these synapses may lead to various neurological disorders such as autism, schizophrenia, Tourette's syndrome and epilepsy(1-4). Synapses are formed through communication between the appropriate synaptic partners(5-8). However, the molecular mechanisms that mediate the formation of specific synaptic types are not known. Here we show that two members of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family, FGF22 and FGF7, promote the organization of excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic terminals, respectively, as target-derived presynaptic organizers. FGF22 and FGF7 are expressed by CA3 pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus. The differentiation of excitatory or inhibitory nerve terminals on dendrites of CA3 pyramidal neurons is specifically impaired in mutants lacking FGF22 or FGF7. These presynaptic defects are rescued by postsynaptic expression of the appropriate FGF. FGF22-deficientmice are resistant to epileptic seizures, and FGF7-deficient mice are prone to them, as expected from the alterations in excitatory/inhibitory balance. Differential effects of FGF22 and FGF7 involve both their distinct synaptic localizations and their use of different signalling pathways. These results demonstrate that specific FGFs act as target-derived presynaptic organizers and help to organize specific presynaptic terminals in the mammalian brain.","[Terauchi, Akiko; Johnson-Venkatesh, Erin M.; Toth, Anna B.; Javed, Danish; Sutton, Michael A.; Umemori, Hisashi] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Mol & Behav Neurosci Inst, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Sutton, Michael A.] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Mol & Integrat Physiol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Umemori, Hisashi] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Umemori, H (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Mol & Behav Neurosci Inst, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",umemoh@umich.edu,"Sutton, Michael/C-6264-2011",,Ester A. & Joseph Klingenstein Fund; Edward Mallinckrodt Jr Foundation; March of Dimes Foundation; Whitehall Foundation,"We thank J.

This difficult question is central to the interpretation and utility of BOLD, with major significance for fMRI studies in basic research and clinical applications(3). Using a novel integrated technology unifying optogenetic(4-13) control of inputs with high-field fMRI signal readouts, we show here that specific stimulation of local CaMKII alpha-expressing excitatory neurons, either in the neocortex or thalamus, elicits positive BOLD signals at the stimulus location with classical kinetics. We also show that optogenetic fMRI (ofMRI) allows visualization of the causal effects of specific cell types defined not only by genetic identity and cell body location, but also by axonal projection target. Finally, we show that ofMRI within the living and intact mammalian brain reveals BOLD signals in downstream targets distant from the stimulus, indicating that this approach can be used to map the global effects of controlling a local cell population. In this respect, unlike both conventional fMRI studies based on correlations 14 and fMRI with electrical stimulation that will also directly drive afferent and nearby axons, this ofMRI approach provides causal information about the global circuits recruited by defined local neuronal activity patterns. Together these findings provide an empirical foundation for the widely-used fMRI BOLD signal, and the features of ofMRI define a potent tool that may be suitable for functional circuit analysis as well as global phenotyping of dysfunctional circuitry.","[Lee, Jin Hyung] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Elect Engn Psychiat & Biobehav Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Lee, Jin Hyung; Durand, Remy; Gradinaru, Viviana; Zhang, Feng; Goshen, Inbal; Fenno, Lief E.; Ramakrishnan, Charu; Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Dept Bioengn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kim, Dae-Shik] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Taejon 305701, South Korea; [Kim, Dae-Shik] Boston Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02118 USA; [Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, CNC Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Lee, JH (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Elect Engn Psychiat & Biobehav Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",ljinhy@gmail.com; deissero@stanford.edu,"Kim, Dae-Shik/C-2071-2011; Bullmore, Edward/C-1706-2012","Bullmore, Edward/0000-0002-8955-8283; Ramakrishnan, Charu/0000-0002-3474-6332; Goshen, Inbal/0000-0001-7578-2615",NIH [(K99/R00) 1K99EB008738]; NSF; SGF; SIGF; Deisseroth laboratory; Keck Foundation; Snyder Foundation; Woo Foundation; Yu Foundation; McKnight Foundation; Coulter Foundation; CIRM; NIMH; NIDA,"J.H.L. is supported by NIH pathway to independence grant (K99/R00) 1K99EB008738.

Progenitor cells of the haematopoietic system, such as common myeloid progenitors and common lymphoid progenitors, increase the production of immune cells to restore and maintain homeostasis during chronic infection, but the contribution of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to this process is largely unknown(2). Here we show, using an in vivo mouse model of Mycobacterium avium infection, that an increased proportion of long-term repopulating HSCs proliferate during M. avium infection, and that this response requires interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) but not interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) signalling. Thus, the haematopoietic response to chronic bacterial infection involves the activation not only of intermediate blood progenitors but of long-term repopulating HSCs as well. IFN-gamma is sufficient to promote long-term repopulating HSC proliferation in vivo; furthermore, HSCs from IFN-gamma-deficient mice have a lower proliferative rate, indicating that baseline IFN-gamma tone regulates HSC activity. These findings implicate IFN-gamma both as a regulator of HSCs during homeostasis and under conditions of infectious stress. Our studies contribute to a deeper understanding of haematological responses in patients with chronic infections such as HIV/AIDS or tuberculosis(3-5).","[Baldridge, Megan T.; Weksberg, David C.; Goodell, Margaret A.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Human Genet, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [King, Katherine Y.; Goodell, Margaret A.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Pediat, Infect Dis Sect, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Boles, Nathan C.; Goodell, Margaret A.] Baylor Coll Med, Interdept Program Cell & Mol Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Goodell, MA (reprint author), Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol & Human Genet, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",goodell@bcm.edu,,"Baldridge, Megan/0000-0002-7030-6131",NIDDK institute of the National Institutes of Health (NIH); Texas Children's Hospital Auxiliary; Simmons Foundation; NHLBI institute of the NIH; NCI institute of the NIH; NIBIB institute of the NIH,"We thank C.

Modulation of their effects through ovarian ablation or chemoprevention strategies also significantly decreases breast cancer incidence(5,6). Conversely, there is an increased risk of breast cancer associated with pregnancy in the short term(7). The cellular mechanisms underlying these observations, however, are poorly defined. Here we demonstrate that mouse mammary stem cells (MaSCs)(8,9) are highly responsive to steroid hormone signalling, despite lacking the oestrogen and progesterone receptors(10). Ovariectomy markedly diminished MaSC number and outgrowth potential in vivo, whereas MaSC activity increased in mice treated with oestrogen plus progesterone. Notably, even three weeks of treatment with the aromatase inhibitor letrozole was sufficient to reduce the MaSC pool. In contrast, pregnancy led to a transient 11-fold increase in MaSC numbers, probably mediated through paracrine signalling from RANK ligand. The augmented MaSC pool indicates a cellular basis for the short-term increase in breast cancer incidence that accompanies pregnancy. These findings further indicate that breast cancer chemoprevention may be achieved, in part, through suppression of MaSC function.","[Asselin-Labat, Marie-Liesse; Vaillant, Francois; Sheridan, Julie M.; Pal, Bhupinder; Wu, Di; Smyth, Gordon K.; Lindeman, Geoffrey J.; Visvader, Jane E.] Walter & Eliza Hall Inst Med Res, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia; [Wu, Di; Smyth, Gordon K.; Visvader, Jane E.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Med Biol, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Simpson, Evan R.] Monash Med Ctr, Prince Henrys Inst Med Res, Clayton, Vic 3168, Australia; [Yasuda, Hisataka] Oriental Yeast Co, Nagahama Inst Biochem Sci, Shiga 5260804, Japan; [Martin, T.

Increased breast cancer risk is entwined with a greater number of ovarian hormone-dependent reproductive cycles, yet the basis for this predisposition is unknown(3-5). Mammary stem cells (MaSCs) are located within a specialized niche in the basal epithelial compartment that is under local and systemic regulation(6). The emerging role of MaSCs in cancer initiation warrants the study of ovarian hormones in MaSC homeostasis. Here we show that the MaSC pool increases 14-fold during maximal progesterone levels at the luteal dioestrus phase of the mouse. Stem-cell-enriched CD49f(hi) cells amplify at dioestrus, or with exogenous progesterone, demonstrating a key role for progesterone in propelling this expansion. In aged mice, CD49f(hi) cells display stasis upon cessation of the reproductive cycle. Progesterone drives a series of events where luminal cells probably provide Wnt4 and RANKL signals to basal cells which in turn respond by upregulating their cognate receptors, transcriptional targets and cell cycle markers. Our findings uncover a dynamic role for progesterone in activating adult MaSCs within the mammary stem cell niche during the reproductive cycle, where MaSCs are putative targets for cell transformation events leading to breast cancer.","[Joshi, Purna A.; Jackson, Hartland W.; Beristain, Alexander G.; Di Grappa, Marco A.; Waterhouse, Paul D.; Khokha, Rama] Univ Toronto, Dept Med Biophys, Ontario Canc Inst, Toronto, ON M5G 2M9, Canada; [Joshi, Purna A.; Jackson, Hartland W.; Beristain, Alexander G.; Di Grappa, Marco A.; Waterhouse, Paul D.; Khokha, Rama] Univ Toronto, Dept Lab Med & Pathobiol, Toronto, ON M5G 2M9, Canada; [Mote, Patricia A.; Clarke, Christine L.] Univ Sydney, Westmead Millennium Inst, Westmead Inst Canc Res, Westmead, NSW 2145, Australia; [Stingl, John] Li Ka Shing Ctr, Cambridge Res Inst, Canc Res UK, Cambridge CB2 0RE, England","Khokha, R (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Dept Med Biophys, Ontario Canc Inst, Toronto, ON M5G 2M9, Canada.",rkhokha@uhnres.utoronto.ca,,"Jackson, Hartland/0000-0001-6423-2415","Canadian Breast Cancer Research Alliance; National Cancer Institute of Canada; Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation, Ontario","This work was supported by grants from the Canadian Breast Cancer Research Alliance.

The patient-derived cells have a mutation in the PTPN11 gene, which encodes the SHP2 phosphatase. The iPSCs have been extensively characterized and produce multiple differentiated cell lineages. A major disease phenotype in patients with LEOPARD syndrome is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We show that in vitro-derived cardiomyocytes from LEOPARD syndrome iPSCs are larger, have a higher degree of sarcomeric organization and preferential localization of NFATC4 in the nucleus when compared with cardiomyocytes derived from human embryonic stem cells or wild-type iPSCs derived from a healthy brother of one of the LEOPARD syndrome patients.

Recent work with the Ts65Dn model of DS, which has orthologues of about 50% of the genes on chromosome 21 (Hsa21), has indicated that three copies of the ETS2 (ref. 3) or DS candidate region 1 (DSCR1) genes(4) (a previously known suppressor of angiogenesis(5,6)) is sufficient to inhibit tumour growth. Here we use the Tc1 transchromosomic mouse model of DS(7) to dissect the contribution of extra copies of genes on Hsa21 to tumour angiogenesis. This mouse expresses roughly 81% of Hsa21 genes but not the human DSCR1 region. We transplanted B16F0 and Lewis lung carcinoma tumour cells into Tc1 mice and showed that growth of these tumours was substantially reduced compared with wild-type littermate controls. Furthermore, tumour angiogenesis was significantly repressed in Tc1 mice. In particular, in vitro and in vivo angiogenic responses to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were inhibited. Examination of the genes on the segment of Hsa21 in Tc1 mice identified putative anti-angiogenic genes (ADAMTS1(8,9) and ERG(10)) and novel endothelial cell-specific genes(11), never previously shown to be involved in angiogenesis (JAM-B(12) and PTTG1IP), that, when overexpressed, are responsible for inhibiting angiogenic responses to VEGF. Three copies of these genes within the stromal compartment reduced tumour angiogenesis, explaining the reduced tumour growth in DS. Furthermore, we expect that, in addition to the candidate genes that we show to be involved in the repression of angiogenesis, the Tc1 mouse model of DS will permit the identification of other endothelium-specific anti-angiogenic targets relevant to a broad spectrum of cancer patients.","[Reynolds, Louise E.; Watson, Alan R.; Baker, Marianne; D'Amico, Gabriela; Robinson, Stephen D.; Hodivala-Dilke, Kairbaan M.] Queen Mary Univ London, John Vane Sci Ctr, Adhes & Angiogenesis Lab, Barts Inst Canc,Barts & London Sch Med & Dent, London EC1M 6BQ, England; [Joffre, Carine; Kermorgant, Stephanie; Hart, Ian R.] Queen Mary Univ London, John Vane Sci Ctr, Tumor Biol Ctr, Inst Canc,Barts & London Sch Med & Dent, London EC1M 6BQ, England; [Jones, Tania A.; Sheer, Denise] Queen Mary Univ London, Ctr Neurosci, Barts & London Sch Med & Dent, Inst Cell & Mol Sci, London E1 2AD, England; [Nizetic, Dean] Queen Mary Univ London, Paediat Ctr, Barts & London Sch Med & Dent, Inst Cell & Mol Sci, London E1 2AD, England; [Garrido-Urbani, Sarah; Imhof, Beat A.] Univ Geneva, Sch Med CMU, Dept Pathol & Immunol, Ctr Med Univ, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Carlos Rodriguez-Manzaneque, Juan; Martino-Echarri, Estefania] GENYO, Granada, Spain; [Aurrand-Lions, Michel] INSERM, F-13009 Marseille, France; [Dagna-Bricarelli, Franca] Galliera Hosp, Inst Human Genet, I-16128 Genoa, Italy; [McCabe, Christopher J.] Univ Birmingham, Sch Clin & Expt Med, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Turnell, Andrew S.] Univ Birmingham, Sch Canc Sci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Adams, Ralf] Max Planck Inst Mol Biomed, D-48149 Munster, Germany; [Fisher, Elizabeth M.

Crystal structures of archaeal and bacterial homologues of AGOs have shown that the MID(middle) domain mediates the interaction with the phosphorylated 5' end of the miRNA guide strand and this interaction is thought to be independent of the identity of the 5' nucleotide in these systems(2,3). However, analysis of the known sequences of eukaryotic miRNAs and co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that there is a clear bias for U or A at the 5' position(4-7). Here we report the crystal structure of a MID domain from a eukaryotic AGO protein, human AGO2. The structure, in complex with nucleoside monophosphates (AMP, CMP, GMP, and UMP) mimicking the 5' end of miRNAs, shows that there are specific contacts made between the base of UMP or AMP and a rigid loop in the MID domain. Notably, the structure of the loop discriminates against CMP and GMP and dissociation constants calculated from NMR titration experiments confirm these results, showing that AMP (0.26 mM) and UMP (0.12 mM) bind with up to 30-fold higher affinity than either CMP (3.6 mM) or GMP (3.3 mM). This study provides structural evidence for nucleotide-specific interactions in the MID domain of eukaryotic AGO proteins and explains the observed preference for U or A at the 5' end of miRNAs.","[Frank, Filipp; Sonenberg, Nahum; Nagar, Bhushan] McGill Univ, Dept Biochem, Montreal, PQ H3G 0B1, Canada; [Frank, Filipp; Sonenberg, Nahum] McGill Univ, Goodman Canc Ctr, Montreal, PQ H3G 0B1, Canada; [Frank, Filipp; Nagar, Bhushan] Grp Rech Axe Struct Prot, Montreal, PQ H3G 0B1, Canada","Nagar, B (reprint author), McGill Univ, Dept Biochem, Montreal, PQ H3G 0B1, Canada.",bhushan.nagar@mcgill.ca,,,Canada Research Chair; Human Frontiers Science Program [CDA 0018/2006-C/1]; Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) [MOP-82929]; Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds,"We thank O.

In URu2Si2 these effects begin at temperatures around 55 K but they are suddenly altered by an unidentified electronic phase transition at T-o=17.5 K. Whether this is conventional ordering of the k-space states, or a change in the hybridization of the r-space states at each U atom, is unknown. Here we use spectroscopic imaging scanning tunnelling microscopy (SI-STM) to image the evolution of URu2Si2 electronic structure simultaneously in r-space and k-space. Above T-o, the 'Fano lattice' electronic structure predicted for Kondo screening of a magnetic lattice is revealed. Below T-o, a partial energy gap without any associated density-wave signatures emerges from this Fano lattice. Heavy-quasiparticle interference imaging within this gap reveals its cause as the rapid splitting below T-o of a light k-space band into two new heavy fermion bands. Thus, the URu2Si2 'hidden order' state emerges directly from the Fano lattice electronic structure and exhibits characteristics, not of a conventional density wave, but of sudden alterations in both the hybridization at each U atom and the associated heavy fermion states.","[Schmidt, A.

HIF alpha protein levels are increased in most solid tumours and correlate with patient prognosis. The link between HIF and apoptosis, a major determinant of cancer progression and treatment outcome, is poorly understood. Here we show that Caenorhabditis elegans HIF-1 protects against DNA-damage-induced germ cell apoptosis by antagonizing the function of CEP-1, the homologue of the tumour suppressor p53. The antiapoptotic property of HIF-1 is mediated by means of transcriptional upregulation of the tyrosinase family member TYR-2 in the ASJ sensory neurons. TYR-2 is secreted by ASJ sensory neurons to antagonize CEP-1-dependent germline apoptosis. Knock down of the TYR-2 homologue TRP2 (also called DCT) in human melanoma cells similarly increases apoptosis, indicating an evolutionarily conserved function. Our findings identify a novel link between hypoxia and programmed cell death, and provide a paradigm for HIF-1 dictating apoptotic cell fate at a distance.","[Sendoel, Ataman; Kohler, Ines; Fellmann, Christof; Hengartner, Michael O.] Univ Zurich, Inst Mol Life Sci, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Sendoel, Ataman] Univ Zurich, PhD Program Canc Biol, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Sendoel, Ataman] Univ Zurich, MD PhD Program, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Lowe, Scott W.] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; [Fellmann, Christof] Univ Zurich, PhD Program Mol Life Sci, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland","Hengartner, MO (reprint author), Univ Zurich, Inst Mol Life Sci, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",michael.hengartner@imls.uzh.ch,"Hengartner, Michael/E-6235-2011","Hengartner, Michael/0000-0002-7584-596X; Fellmann, Christof/0000-0002-9545-5723",Swiss National Science Foundation; Kanton of Zurich; Josef-Steiner Foundation; Oncosuisse; NIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR),"We thank Y.

In mice, Ago2 (also known as Eif2c2) is uniquely required for viability, and only this family member retains catalytic competence. To investigate the evolutionary pressure to conserve Argonaute enzymatic activity, we engineered a mouse with catalytically inactive Ago2 alleles. Homozygous mutants died shortly after birth with an obvious anaemia. Examination of microRNAs and their potential targets revealed a loss of miR-451, a small RNA important for erythropoiesis. Though this microRNA is processed by Drosha (also known as Rnasen), its maturation does not require Dicer. Instead, the pre-miRNA becomes loaded into Ago and is cleaved by the Ago catalytic centre to generate an intermediate 39 end, which is then further trimmed. Our findings link the conservation of Argonaute catalysis to a conserved mechanism of microRNA biogenesis that is important for vertebrate development.","[Cheloufi, Sihem; Dos Santos, Camila O.; Hannon, Gregory J.] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Watson Sch Biol Sci, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; [Cheloufi, Sihem] SUNY Stony Brook, Grad Program Genet, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Chong, Mark M.

This compromise is central to the behaviour of many complex systems, from social(1) and neural(2) networks to protein folding(3) and magnetism(4,5). Frustrated networks have highly degenerate ground states, with excess entropy and disorder even at zero temperature. In the case of quantum networks, frustration can lead to massively entangled ground states, underpinning exotic materials such as quantum spin liquids and spin glasses(6-9). Here we realize a quantum simulation of frustrated Ising spins in a system of three trapped atomic ions(10-12), whose interactions are precisely controlled using optical forces(13). We study the ground state of this system as it adiabatically evolves from a transverse polarized state, and observe that frustration induces extra degeneracy. We also measure the entanglement in the system, finding a link between frustration and ground-state entanglement. This experimental system can be scaled to simulate larger numbers of spins, the ground states of which (for frustrated interactions) cannot be simulated on a classical computer.","[Kim, K.; Chang, M. -S.; Korenblit, S.; Islam, R.; Edwards, E.

At present, entangled-light sources are optically driven with lasers(3-7), which are impractical for quantum computing owing to the bulk and complexity of the optics required for large-scale applications. Parametric down-conversion is the most widely used source of entangled light, and has been used to implement non-destructive quantum logic gates(8,9). However, these sources are Poissonian(4,5) and probabilistically emit zero or multiple entangled photon pairs in most cycles, fundamentally limiting the success probability of quantum computational operations. These complications can be overcome by using an electrically driven on-demand source of entangled photon pairs(10), but so far such a source has not been produced. Here we report the realization of an electrically driven source of entangled photon pairs, consisting of a quantum dot embedded in a semiconductor light-emitting diode (LED) structure. We show that the device emits entangled photon pairs under d.c. and a.c. injection, the latter achieving an entanglement fidelity of up to 0.82. Entangled light with such high fidelity is sufficient for application in quantum relays(11), in core components of quantum computing such as teleportation(12-14), and in entanglement swapping(15,16). The a.c. operation of the entangled-lightemitting diode (ELED) indicates its potential function as an ondemand source without the need for a complicated laser driving system; consequently, the ELED is at present the best source on which to base future scalable quantum information applications(17).","[Salter, C.

The most widely studied SC-SC transformations involve solvent exchange reactions in porous coordination polymers or metal-organic frameworks, which take advantage of the robust polymeric networks of the hosts(2,8,9-11). Examples of reactions occurring within molecular organic crystals generally involve photo-induced reactions, such as the coupling of alkenes or alkynes within the crystal(1,2,12-15). For nonporous molecular inorganic or organometallic crystals, single-crystal transformations involving the formation or cleavage of metal-ligand bonds are rare(17-21); known examples usually involve ligand loss from the single crystal and reversible religation, a process sometimes accompanied by decay of the single crystal to a microcrystalline powder(20,21). Here we report a series of SC-SC transformations that involve the interchange of multiple small gaseous ligands (N(2), CO, NH(3), C(2)H(4), H(2) and O(2)) at an iridium centre in molecular single crystals of a pincer Ir(I) complex. The single crystal remains intact during these ligand-exchange reactions, which occur within the crystal and do not require prior ligand extrusion. We reveal a selective catalytic transformation within a nonporous molecular crystal: pincer iridium single crystals ligated with nitrogen, ethylene or hydrogen show selective hydrogenation of ethylene relative to propylene (25:1) when surface sites are passified by CO.","[Huang, Zheng; White, Peter S.; Brookhart, Maurice] Univ N Carolina, Dept Chem, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA","Brookhart, M (reprint author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Chem, CB 3290, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",mbrookhart@unc.edu,,"Huang, Zheng/0000-0001-7524-098X",National Science Foundation under the auspices of the Centre for Enabling New Technologies through Catalysis (CENTC),This work is financially supported by the National Science Foundation under the auspices of the Centre for Enabling New Technologies through Catalysis (CENTC).,,30,90,90,11,144,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Jun,2010,465,7298,,,,,598,601,,10.1038/nature09085,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,604AF,WOS:000278249000037,20520710.0,No,,,11/20/17,maurice,brookhart,male,0.98,221,3mxyA2QAAAAJ,14946

The Mediterranean represents a remarkable example of this tectonic setting(3): the region hosts a diffuse boundary between the Nubia and Eurasia plates comprised of a mosaic of microplates that move and deform independently from the overall plate convergence(4). Surface expressions of Mediterranean tectonics include deep, subsiding backarc basins, intraplate plateaux and uplifting orogenic belts. Although the kinematics of the area are now fairly well defined, the dynamical origins of many of these active features are controversial and usually attributed to crustal and lithospheric interactions. However, the effects of mantle convection, well established for continental interiors(5-7), should be particularly relevant in a mobile belt, and modelling may constrain important parameters such as slab coherence and lithospheric strength. Here we compute global mantle flow on the basis of recent, high-resolution seismic tomography to investigate the role of buoyancy-driven and plate-motion-induced mantle circulation for the Mediterranean. We show that mantle flow provides an explanation for much of the observed dynamic topography and microplate motion in the region. More generally, vigorous small-scale convection in the uppermost mantle may also underpin other complex mobile belts such as the North American Cordillera or the Himalayan-Tibetan collision zone.","[Faccenna, Claudio] Univ Roma TRE, Dipartimento Sci Geol, I-00146 Rome, Italy; [Faccenna, Claudio] CNR IGAG, I-00016 Monterotondo, Italy; [Becker, Thorsten W.] Univ So Calif, Dept Earth Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA","Faccenna, C (reprint author), Univ Roma TRE, Dipartimento Sci Geol, I-00146 Rome, Italy.",faccenna@uniroma3.it,,,University of Southern California (USC); Consiglio Nazionale Ricerche; TOPOEUROPE; MEDUSA [NSF-EAR 0451952],"C.

Indirect evidence indicates that the anaerobic oxidation of methane might proceed as the reverse of archaeal methanogenesis from carbon dioxide with the nickel-containing methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR) as the methane-activating enzyme(4,5). However, experiments showing that MCR can catalyse the endergonic back reaction have been lacking. Here we report that purified MCR from Methanothermobacter marburgensis converts methane into methyl-coenzyme M under equilibrium conditions with apparent V(max) (maximum rate) and Km (Michaelis constant) values consistent with the observed in vivo kinetics of the anaerobic oxidation of methane with sulphate(6-8). This result supports the hypothesis of 'reverse methanogenesis'(4,9) and is paramount to understanding the still-unknown mechanism of the last step of methanogenesis. The ability of MCR to cleave the particularly strong C-H bond of methane without the involvement of highly reactive oxygen-derived intermediates is directly relevant to catalytic C-H activation, currently an area of great interest in chemistry(10-13).","[Scheller, Silvan; Jaun, Bernhard] ETH, Organ Chem Lab, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Goenrich, Meike; Boecher, Reinhard; Thauer, Rudolf K.] Max Planck Inst Terr Microbiol, D-35043 Marburg, Germany","Jaun, B (reprint author), ETH, Organ Chem Lab, Wolfgang Pauli Str 10, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",jaun@org.chem.ethz.ch,"Scheller, Silvan/M-8899-2017",,Swiss National Science Foundation [200020-119752]; Max Planck Society; Fonds der Chemischen Industrie,"We thank the Swiss National Science Foundation (S.S. and B.J.; grant 200020-119752) and the Max Planck Society and the Fonds der Chemischen Industrie (M.G., R.B. and R.K.T.) for financial support.",,32,140,142,11,155,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Jun,2010,465,7298,,,,,606,U97,,10.1038/nature09015,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,604AF,WOS:000278249000039,20520712.0,No,,,11/20/17,bernhard,jaun,male,1,47,na,na

Species-rich communities are thought to produce more temporally stable ecosystem services because of the complementary or independent dynamics among species that perform similar ecosystem functions(6). Such variance dampening within communities is referred to as a portfolio effect(7) and is analogous to the effects of asset diversity on the stability of financial portfolios(8). In ecology, these arguments have focused on the effects of species diversity on ecosystem stability but have not considered the importance of biologically relevant diversity within individual species(9). Current rates of population extirpation are probably at least three orders of magnitude higher than species extinction rates(10), so there is a pressing need to clarify how population and life history diversity affect the performance of individual species in providing important ecosystem services. Here we use five decades of data from Oncorhynchus nerka (sockeye salmon) in Bristol Bay, Alaska, to provide the first quantification of portfolio effects that derive from population and life history diversity in an important and heavily exploited species. Variability in annual Bristol Bay salmon returns is 2.2 times lower than it would be if the system consisted of a single homogenous population rather than the several hundred discrete populations it currently consists of. Furthermore, if it were a single homogeneous population, such increased variability would lead to ten times more frequent fisheries closures. Portfolio effects are also evident in watershed food webs, where they stabilize and extend predator access to salmon resources. Our results demonstrate the critical importance of maintaining population diversity for stabilizing ecosystem services and securing the economies and livelihoods that depend on them. The reliability of ecosystem services will erode faster than indicated by species loss alone.","[Schindler, Daniel E.; Hilborn, Ray; Chasco, Brandon; Boatright, Christopher P.; Quinn, Thomas P.; Rogers, Lauren A.] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Webster, Michael S.] Gordon & Betty Moore Fdn, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA","Schindler, DE (reprint author), Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Box 355020, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",deschind@u.washington.edu,"Hilborn, Ray/D-6332-2013",,Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation; US National Science Foundation; University of Washington; Alaska salmon processing industry; H.

The adaptive radiation of Caribbean Anolis lizards has been studied for decades(2-5), leading to precise predictions about the influence of alternative agents of selection in the wild. Here we present experimental evidence for the relative importance of two putative agents of selection in shaping the adaptive landscape for a classic island radiation. We manipulated whole-island populations of the brown anole lizard, Anolis sagrei, to measure the relative importance of predation versus competition as agents of natural selection. We excluded or included bird and snake predators across six islands that ranged from low to high population densities of lizards, then measured subsequent differences in behaviour and natural selection in each population. Predators altered the lizards' perching behaviour and increased mortality, but predation treatments did not alter selection on phenotypic traits. By contrast, experimentally increasing population density dramatically increased the strength of viability selection favouring large body size, long relative limb length and high running stamina. Our results from A. sagrei are consistent with the hypothesis(6) that intraspecific competition is more important than predation in shaping the selective landscape for traits central to the adaptive radiation of Anolis ecomorphs.","[Calsbeek, Ryan; Cox, Robert M.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Biol Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA","Calsbeek, R (reprint author), Dartmouth Coll, Dept Biol Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",ryan.calsbeek@dartmouth.edu,,,National Science Foundation; Dartmouth College,"We thank T.

These seaweeds are the dominant species in rocky coastal ecosystems and they exhibit many interesting adaptations to these, often harsh, environments. Brown algae are also one of only a small number of eukaryotic lineages that have evolved complex multicellularity (Fig. 1). We report the 214 million base pair (Mbp) genome sequence of the filamentous seaweed Ectocarpus siliculosus (Dillwyn) Lyngbye, a model organism for brown algae(2-5), closely related to the kelps(6,7) (Fig. 1). Genome features such as the presence of an extended set of light-harvesting and pigment biosynthesis genes and new metabolic processes such as halide metabolism help explain the ability of this organism to cope with the highly variable tidal environment. The evolution of multicellularity in this lineage is correlated with the presence of a rich array of signal transduction genes. Of particular interest is the presence of a family of receptor kinases, as the independent evolution of related molecules has been linked with the emergence of multicellularity in both the animal and green plant lineages. The Ectocarpus genome sequence represents an important step towards developing this organism as a model species, providing the possibility to combine genomic and genetic(2) approaches to explore these and other(4,5) aspects of brown algal biology further.","[Cock, J.

Although the benefits of mentorship for proteges, mentors and their organizations are apparent(1-9), the extent to which proteges mimic their mentors' career choices and acquire their mentorship skills is unclear(10-16). The importance of a science, technology, engineering and mathematics workforce to economic growth and the role of effective mentorship in maintaining a 'healthy' such workforce demand the study of the role of mentorship in academia. Here we investigate one aspect of mentor emulation by studying mentorship fecundity-the number of proteges a mentor trains-using data from the Mathematics Genealogy Project(17), which tracks the mentorship record of thousands of mathematicians over several centuries. We demonstrate that fecundity among academic mathematicians is correlated with other measures of academic success. We also find that the average fecundity of mentors remains stable over 60 years of recorded mentorship. We further discover three significant correlations in mentorship fecundity. First, mentors with low mentorship fecundities train proteges that go on to have mentorship fecundities 37% higher than expected. Second, in the first third of their careers, mentors with high fecundities train proteges that go on to have fecundities 29% higher than expected. Finally, in the last third of their careers, mentors with high fecundities train proteges that go on to have fecundities 31% lower than expected.","[Malmgren, R.

They are particularly useful when inbred lines are available, because once these lines have been genotyped they can be phenotyped multiple times, making it possible (as well as extremely cost effective) to study many different traits in many different environments, while replicating the phenotypic measurements to reduce environmental noise. Here we demonstrate the power of this approach by carrying out a GWA study of 107 phenotypes in Arabidopsis thaliana, a widely distributed, predominantly self-fertilizing model plant known to harbour considerable genetic variation for many adaptively important traits(3). Our results are dramatically different from those of human GWA studies, in that we identify many common alleles of major effect, but they are also, in many cases, harder to interpret because confounding by complex genetics and population structure make it difficult to distinguish true associations from false.

Some of this variation can be explained by conflicting pressures from pathogens with different modes of attack(1). A second explanation comes from an evolutionary 'tug of war', in which pathogens adapt to evade detection, until the plant has evolved new recognition capabilities for pathogen invasion(2-5). If selection is, however, sufficiently strong, susceptible hosts should remain rare. That this is not the case is best explained by costs incurred from constitutive defences in a pest-free environment(6-11). Using a combination of forward genetics and genome-wide association analyses, we demonstrate that allelic diversity at a single locus, ACCELERATED CELL DEATH 6 (ACD6)(12,13), underpins marked pleiotropic differences in both vegetative growth and resistance to microbial infection and herbivory among natural Arabidopsis thaliana strains. A hyperactive ACD6 allele, compared to the reference allele, strongly enhances resistance to a broad range of pathogens from different phyla, but at the same time slows the production of new leaves and greatly reduces the biomass of mature leaves. This allele segregates at intermediate frequency both throughout the worldwide range of A. thaliana and within local populations, consistent with this allele providing substantial fitness benefits despite its marked impact on growth.","[Todesco, Marco; Balasubramanian, Sureshkumar; Sureshkumar, Sridevi; Lanz, Christa; Laitinen, Roosa A.

Cooperative communication between these regions is important for catalysis, regulation and efficient folding; lack of coupling has been implicated in the formation of fibrils and other misfolding pathologies(1). How different structural regions of a protein communicate and contribute to a protein's overall energetics and folding, however, is still poorly understood. Here we use a single-molecule optical tweezers approach to induce the selective unfolding of particular regions of T4 lysozyme and monitor the effect on other regions not directly acted on by force. We investigate how the topological organization of a protein (the order of structural elements along the sequence) affects the coupling and folding cooperativity between its domains. To probe the status of the regions not directly subjected to force, we determine the free energy changes during mechanical unfolding using Crooks' fluctuation theorem. We pull on topological variants (circular permutants) and find that the topological organization of the polypeptide chain critically determines the folding cooperativity between domains and thus what parts of the folding/unfolding landscape are explored. We speculate that proteins may have evolved to select certain topologies that increase coupling between regions to avoid areas of the landscape that lead to kinetic trapping and misfolding.","[Shank, Elizabeth A.; Cecconi, Ciro; Marqusee, Susan; Bustamante, Carlos] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Shank, Elizabeth A.; Cecconi, Ciro; Dill, Jesse W.; Marqusee, Susan; Bustamante, Carlos] Univ Calif Berkeley, Inst Quantitat Biosci, Jason L Choy Lab Single Mol Biophys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Dill, Jesse W.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Biophys Grad Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Bustamante, Carlos] Univ Calif Berkeley, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Bustamante, Carlos] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Bustamante, Carlos] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Marqusee, S (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, 229 Stanley Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",Marqusee@berkeley.edu; Carlos@alice.berkeley.edu,"Cecconi, Ciro/K-5028-2016","Cecconi, Ciro/0000-0002-6101-2609; Shank, Elizabeth/0000-0002-4804-1966; Bustamante, Carlos/0000-0002-2970-0073","NIH [GM 32543, GM 50945]; NSF","We would like to thank G.

These enzymes catalyse the ATP-dependent passage of one DNA duplex (the transport or T-segment) through a transient, double-stranded break in another (the gate or G-segment), navigating DNA through the protein using a set of dissociable internal interfaces, or 'gates'(3,4). For more than 20 years, it has been established that a pair of dimer-related tyrosines, together with divalent cations, catalyse G-segment cleavage(5-7). Recent efforts have proposed that strand scission relies on a 'two-metal mechanism'(8-10), a ubiquitous biochemical strategy that supports vital cellular processes ranging from DNA synthesis to RNA self-splicing(11,12). Here we present the structure of the DNA-binding and cleavage core of Saccharomyces cerevisiae topoisomerase II covalently linked to DNA through its active-site tyrosine at 2.5 angstrom resolution, revealing for the first time the organization of a cleavage-competent type II topoisomerase configuration. Unexpectedly, metal-soaking experiments indicate that cleavage is catalysed by a novel variation of the classic two-metal approach. Comparative analyses extend this scheme to explain how distantly-related type IA topoisomerases cleave single-stranded DNA, unifying the cleavage mechanisms for these two essential enzyme families. The structure also highlights a hitherto undiscovered allosteric relay that actuates a molecular 'trapdoor' to prevent subunit dissociation during cleavage. This connection illustrates how an indispensable chromosome-disentangling machine auto-regulates DNA breakage to prevent the aberrant formation of mutagenic and cytotoxic genomic lesions.","[Schmidt, Bryan H.; Berger, James M.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Burgin, Alex B.] Emerald BioStruct, Bainbridge Isl, WA 98110 USA; [Deweese, Joseph E.; Osheroff, Neil] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Biochem, Sch Med, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [Osheroff, Neil] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Med Hematol Oncol, Sch Med, Nashville, TN 37232 USA","Berger, JM (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, 229 Stanley Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",jmberger@berkeley.edu,,,"NIH [GM033944, GM053960, T32CA09592, GM08295, CA077373]",This work was supported the NIH (GM033944 and GM053960 for N.O.; T32CA09592 for J.E.D.; GM08295 for B.

However, intracellular free copper must be strictly limited because of its toxic side effects. Complex systems for copper trafficking evolved to satisfy cellular requirements while minimizing toxicity(2). The factors driving the copper transfer between protein partners along cellular copper routes are, however, not fully rationalized. Until now, inconsistent, scattered and incomparable data on the copper-binding affinities of copper proteins have been reported. Here we determine, through a unified electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS)-based strategy, in an environment that mimics the cellular redox milieu, the apparent Cu(I)-binding affinities for a representative set of intracellular copper proteins involved in enzymatic redox catalysis, in copper trafficking to and within various cellular compartments, and in copper storage. The resulting thermodynamic data show that copper is drawn to the enzymes that require it by passing from one copper protein site to another, exploiting gradients of increasing copper-binding affinity. This result complements the finding that fast copper-transfer pathways require metal-mediated protein-protein interactions and therefore protein-protein specific recognition(3). Together with Cu, Zn-SOD1, metallothioneins have the highest affinity for copper(I), and may play special roles in the regulation of cellular copper distribution; however, for kinetic reasons they cannot demetallate copper enzymes. Our study provides the thermodynamic basis for the kinetic processes that lead to the distribution of cellular copper.","[Banci, Lucia; Bertini, Ivano; Ciofi-Baffoni, Simone; Kozyreva, Tatiana] Univ Florence, Magnet Resonance Ctr CERM, I-50019 Florence, Italy; [Banci, Lucia; Bertini, Ivano; Ciofi-Baffoni, Simone; Kozyreva, Tatiana] Univ Florence, Dept Chem, I-50019 Florence, Italy; [Zovo, Kairit; Palumaa, Peep] Tallinn Univ Technol, Dept Gene Technol, EE-12618 Tallinn, Estonia","Bertini, I (reprint author), Univ Florence, Magnet Resonance Ctr CERM, Via Luigi Sacconi 6, I-50019 Florence, Italy.",ivanobertini@cerm.unifi.it; peepp@staff.ttu.ee,,"Ciofi Baffoni, Simone/0000-0002-2376-3321",Estonian Science Foundation [7191]; Estonian Ministry of Education and Research [SF0140055s08]; SPINE-II-COMPLEXES [LSHG-CT-2006-031220]; FIRB PROTEOMICA MIUR [RBRN07BMCT]; World Federation of Scientists,"This work was supported by grants from the Estonian Science Foundation project 7191, the Estonian Ministry of Education and Research (grant SF0140055s08), by the SPINE-II-COMPLEXES contract LSHG-CT-2006-031220, by the FIRB PROTEOMICA MIUR contract RBRN07BMCT and by a World Federation of Scientists scholarship to K.Z.

The structure reveals dynamin's catalytic machinery and explains how assembly-stimulated GTP hydrolysis is achieved through G domain dimerization. A sodium ion present in the active site suggests that dynamin uses a cation to compensate for the developing negative charge in the transition state in the absence of an arginine finger. Structural comparison to the rat dynamin G domain reveals key conformational changes that promote G domain dimerization and stimulated hydrolysis.

The architecture of the complex provides strong clues about the coupling mechanism: the conformational changes at the interface of the two main domains may drive the long amphipathic alpha-helix of NuoL in a piston-like motion, tilting nearby discontinuous TM helices, resulting in proton translocation.","[Efremov, Rouslan G.; Baradaran, Rozbeh; Sazanov, Leonid A.] Wellcome Trust Res Labs, MRC, Mitochondrial Biol Unit, Cambridge CB2 0XY, England","Sazanov, LA (reprint author), Wellcome Trust Res Labs, MRC, Mitochondrial Biol Unit, MRC Bldg,Hills Rd, Cambridge CB2 0XY, England.",sazanov@mrc-mbu.cam.ac.uk,"Efremov, Rouslan/P-9085-2015","Efremov, Rouslan/0000-0001-7516-8658",Medical Research Council,"This work was funded by the Medical Research Council.

Stratigraphic analyses of the exposed portions of Chasma Boreale-a large canyon 500 km long, up to 100 km wide, and nearly 2 km deep-have led most researchers to favour an erosional process for its formation following initial NPLD accumulation. Candidate mechanisms include the catastrophic outburst of water(5), protracted basal melting(6), erosional undercutting(7), aeolian downcutting(7-9) and a combination of these processes(10). Here we use new data from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to show that Chasma Boreale is instead a long-lived, complex feature resulting primarily from non-uniform accumulation of the NPLD. The initial valley that later became Chasma Boreale was matched by a second, equally large valley that was completely filled in by subsequent deposition, leaving no evidence on the surface to indicate its former presence. We further demonstrate that topography existing before the NPLD began accumulating influenced successive episodes of deposition and erosion, resulting in most of the present-day topography. Long-term and large-scale patterns of mass balance achieved through sedimentary processes, rather than catastrophic events, ice flow or highly focused erosion, have produced the largest geomorphic anomaly in the north polar ice of Mars.","[Holt, J.

The troughs have intrigued planetary scientists since the Mariner 9 spacecraft returned the first close-up image in 1972, but conclusive evidence of their origin has remained elusive. Debate continues regarding all aspects of the troughs, including the possibility that they have migrated(2-5), their age in relation to the current NPLD surface(6), and whether they are fundamentally erosional(6,7) or constructional(2,4) features. The troughs are probably related to climatic processes(2,8), yet the nature of this relationship has remained a mystery. Previous data characterizing only the exposed NLPD surface were insufficient to test these hypotheses. Here we show that the central spiral troughs initiated after deposition of three-quarters of the NPLD, quickly reached a stable morphology and migrated approximately 65 kilometres poleward and 600 metres in altitude over the past two million years or so. Our radar stratigraphy rules out hypotheses of erosional incision post-dating deposition(6,7,9,10), and instead largely validates an early hypothesis for constructional trough migration(2-5) with wind transport and atmospheric deposition as dominant processes. These results provide hard constraints for palaeo-climate models and a new context for evaluating imagery, spectral data, and now radar sounding data, the better to understand the link between orbital parameters and climate, the role of climate in shaping the polar ice of Mars, and eventually, the age of the polar deposits themselves(8,11-13).","[Smith, Isaac B.; Holt, John W.] Univ Texas Inst Geophys, Jackson Sch Geosci, Austin, TX 78758 USA","Smith, IB (reprint author), Univ Texas Inst Geophys, Jackson Sch Geosci, Austin, TX 78758 USA.",isaac@ig.utexas.edu,"Holt, John/C-4896-2009",,NASA [NAG5-12693]; Gayle White Fellowship at the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics,"This work was supported by NASA grant NAG5-12693 to J.H. and by the Gayle White Fellowship at the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics.

Only ten nuclei with the standard magic numbers of both neutrons and protons have so far been observed. The nuclear shell model is founded on the precept that neutrons and protons can move as independent particles in orbitals with discrete quantum numbers, subject to a mean field generated by all the other nucleons. Knowledge of the properties of single-particle states outside nuclear shell closures in exotic nuclei is important(2-5) for a fundamental understanding of nuclear structure and nucleo-synthesis (for example the r-process, which is responsible for the production of about half of the heavy elements). However, as a result of their short lifetimes, there is a paucity of knowledge about the nature of single-particle states outside exotic doubly magic nuclei. Here we measure the single-particle character of the levels in Sn-133 that lie outside the double shell closure present at the short-lived nucleus Sn-132. We use an inverse kinematics technique that involves the transfer of a single nucleon to the nucleus. The purity of the measured single-particle states clearly illustrates the magic nature of Sn-132.","[Jones, K. L.; Chae, K. Y.; Kapler, R.; Ma, Z.; Moazen, B.

In condensed matter, an efficient transfer between L and S can occur owing to the spin-orbit interaction, which originates in the relativistic motion of electrons(1). Disentangling the absolute contributions of the orbital and spin angular momenta is challenging, however, as any transfer between the two occurs on femtosecond timescales. Here we investigate such phenomena by using ultrashort optical laser pulses to change the magnetization of a ferromagnetic film(2-7) and then probe its dynamics with circularly polarized femtosecond X-ray pulses(8). Our measurements enable us to disentangle the spin and orbital components of the magnetic moment, revealing different dynamics for L and S. We highlight the important role played by the spin-orbit interaction in the ultrafast laser-induced demagnetization of ferromagnetic films, and show also that the magneto-crystalline anisotropy energy is an important quantity to consider in such processes. Our study provides insights into the dynamics in magnetic systems(9) as well as perspectives for the ultrafast control of information in magnetic recording media(10).","[Boeglin, C.; Beaurepaire, E.; Halte, V.; Lopez-Flores, V.; Bigot, J. -Y.] CNRS, UMR7504, Inst Phys & Chim Mat Strasbourg, F-67034 Strasbourg, France; [Boeglin, C.; Beaurepaire, E.; Halte, V.; Lopez-Flores, V.; Bigot, J. -Y.] Univ Strasbourg, F-67034 Strasbourg, France; [Stamm, C.; Pontius, N.; Duerr, H.

Its existence has been used to explain a number of seismic observations, such as the D '' reflector and the high degree of seismic anisotropy within the D '' layer(5-8). Ionic diffusion in post-perovskite controls its viscosity, which in turn controls the thermal and chemical coupling between the core and the mantle, the development of plumes and the stability of deep chemical reservoirs(9). Here we report the use of first-principles methods to calculate absolute diffusion rates in post-perovskite under the conditions found in the Earth's lower mantle. We find that the diffusion of Mg(2+) and Si(4+) in post-perovskite is extremely anisotropic, with almost eight orders of magnitude difference between the fast and slow directions. If post-perovskite in the D '' layer shows significant lattice-preferred orientation, the fast diffusion direction will render post-perovskite up to four orders of magnitude weaker than perovskite. The presence of weak postperovskite strongly increases the heat flux across the core-mantle boundary and alters the geotherm(9). It also provides an explanation for laterally varying viscosity in the lowermost mantle, as required by long-period geoid models(10). Moreover, the behaviour of very weak post-perovskite can reconcile seismic observation of a D '' reflector with recent experiments showing that the width of the perovskite-to-post-perovskite transition is too wide to cause sharp reflectors(11). We suggest that the observed sharp D '' reflector is caused by a rapid change in seismic anisotropy. Once sufficient perovskite has transformed into post-perovskite, post-perovskite becomes interconnected and strain is partitioned into this weaker phase. At this point, the weaker post-perovskite will start to deform rapidly, thereby developing a strong crystallographic texture. We show that the expected seismic contrast between the deformed perovskite-plus-post-perovskite assemblage and the overlying isotropic perovskite-plus-post-perovskite assemblage is consistent with seismic observations.","[Ammann, M.

This radiation has been considered to be geographically limited to Asia and western North America(1-3), with only controversial remains reported from other continents. Here we describe new ceratopsian cranial material from the Late Cretaceous of Iharkut, Hungary(6), from a coronosaurian ceratopsian, Ajkaceratops kozmai. Ajkaceratops is most similar to 'bagaceratopsids' such as Bagaceratops and Magnirostris, previously known only from Late Cretaceous east Asia(3,5,7,8). The new material unambiguously demonstrates that ceratopsians occupied Late Cretaceous Europe and, when considered with the recent discovery of possible leptoceratopsid teeth from Sweden(9), indicates that the clade may have reached Europe on at least two independent occasions. European Late Cretaceous dinosaur faunas have been characterized as consisting of a mix of endemic 'relictual' taxa and 'Gondwanan' taxa, with typical Asian and North American groups largely absent(10,11). Ajkaceratops demonstrates that this prevailing biogeographical hypothesis is overly simplified and requires reassessment. Iharkut was part of the western Tethyan archipelago, a tectonically complex series of island chains between Africa and Europe(12), and the occurrence of a coronosaurian ceratopsian in this locality may represent an early Late Cretaceous 'island-hopping' dispersal across the Tethys Ocean.","[Osi, Attila] Hungarian Acad Sci, Res Grp Paleontol, Hungarian Nat Hist Museum, H-1083 Budapest, Hungary; [Butler, Richard J.] Bayer Staatssammlung Palaontol & Geol, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Weishampel, David B.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Ctr Funct Anat & Evolut, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Osi, A (reprint author), Hungarian Acad Sci, Res Grp Paleontol, Hungarian Nat Hist Museum, Ludovika Ter 2, H-1083 Budapest, Hungary.",hungaros@freemail.hu,"Butler, Richard/A-5239-2011","Butler, Richard/0000-0003-2136-7541",Hungarian Scientific Research Fund (OTKA) [PD 73021]; Hantken Foundation; Humboldt Postdoctoral Fellowship,"We thank L.

Until now, such deposits have remained silent regarding the early evolution of extant molluscan lineages-in particular the cephalopods. Nautiloids, traditionally considered basal within the cephalopods, are generally depicted as evolving from a creeping Cambrian ancestor whose dorsal shell afforded protection and buoyancy(2). Although nautiloid-like shells occur from the Late Cambrian onwards, the fossil record provides little constraint on this model, or indeed on the early evolution of cephalopods. Here, we reinterpret the problematic Middle Cambrian animal Nectocaris pteryx(3,4) as a primitive (that is, stem-group), non-mineralized cephalopod, based on new material from the Burgess Shale. Together with Nectocaris, the problematic Lower Cambrian taxa Petalilium(5) and (probably) Vetustovermis(6,7) form a distinctive clade, Nectocarididae, characterized by an open axial cavity with paired gills, wide lateral fins, a single pair of long, prehensile tentacles, a pair of non-faceted eyes on short stalks, and a large, flexible anterior funnel. This clade extends the cephalopods' fossil record(2) by over 30 million years, and indicates that primitive cephalopods lacked a mineralized shell, were hyperbenthic, and were presumably carnivorous. The presence of a funnel suggests that jet propulsion evolved in cephalopods before the acquisition of a shell. The explosive diversification of mineralized cephalopods in the Ordovician may have an understated Cambrian 'fuse'.","[Smith, Martin R.; Caron, Jean-Bernard] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3G5, Canada; [Smith, Martin R.; Caron, Jean-Bernard] Royal Ontario Museum, Dept Nat Hist, Toronto, ON M5S 2C6, Canada","Caron, JB (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 25 Harbord St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G5, Canada.",jcaron@rom.on.ca,"Smith, Martin/B-8461-2012","Smith, Martin/0000-0001-5660-1727; Caron, Jean-Bernard/0000-0002-1670-5502",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; University of Toronto,"We thank S.

Although previous studies have identified important common somatic mutations in lung cancers, they have primarily focused on a limited set of genes and have thus provided a constrained view of the mutational spectrum(3-8). Recent cancer sequencing efforts have used next-generation sequencing technologies to provide a genome-wide view of mutations in leukaemia, breast cancer and cancer cell lines(9-13). Here we present the complete sequences of a primary lung tumour (603 coverage) and adjacent normal tissue (463). Comparing the two genomes, we identify a wide variety of somatic variations, including >50,000 high-confidence single nucleotide variants. We validated 530 somatic single nucleotide variants in this tumour, including one in the KRAS proto-oncogene and 391 others in coding regions, as well as 43 large-scale structural variations. These constitute a large set of new somatic mutations and yield an estimated 17.7 per megabase genome-wide somatic mutation rate. Notably, we observe a distinct pattern of selection against mutations within expressed genes compared to non-expressed genes and in promoter regions up to 5 kilobases upstream of all protein-coding genes. Furthermore, we observe a higher rate of amino acid-changing mutations in kinase genes. We present a comprehensive view of somatic alterations in a single lung tumour, and provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, of distinct selective pressures present within the tumour environment.","[Lee, William; Jiang, Zhaoshi; Liu, Jinfeng; Haverty, Peter M.; Yue, Peng; Zhang, Yan; Watanabe, Colin; Gentleman, Robert; Zhang, Zemin] Genentech Inc, Dept Bioinformat & Computat Biol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Guan, Yinghui; Stinson, Jeremy; Pant, Krishna P.; Bhatt, Deepali; de Sauvage, Frederic J.; Modrusan, Zora; Seshagiri, Somasekar] Genentech Inc, Dept Mol Biol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Pant, Krishna P.; Kennemer, Michael I.; Nazarenko, Igor; Sparks, Andrew B.; Ballinger, Dennis G.; Drmanac, Radoje] Complete Genom Inc, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA; [Johnson, Stephanie; Stern, Howard] Genentech Inc, Dept Pathol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Mohan, Sankar; Shames, David S.; Pandita, Ajay] Genentech Inc, Dept Oncol Diagnost, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA","Zhang, ZM (reprint author), Genentech Inc, Dept Bioinformat & Computat Biol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA.",zemin@gene.com,,"Liu, Jinfeng/0000-0002-0343-8222; Lee, William/0000-0001-9582-4413",,,,29,324,337,3,53,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-May,2010,465,7297,,,,,473,477,,10.1038/nature09004,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,601FM,WOS:000278043700034,20505728.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,zemin,zhang,na,na,na,na,na

Failure to recanalize microvessels promptly may lead to the disruption of brain circuits and significant functional deficits(3). Haemodynamic forces and the fibrinolytic system(4) are considered to be the principal mechanisms responsible for recanalization of occluded cerebral capillaries and terminal arterioles. Here we identify a previously unrecognized cellular mechanism that may also be critical for this recanalization. By using high-resolution fixed-tissue microscopy and two-photon imaging in living mice we observed that a large fraction of microemboli infused through the internal carotid artery failed to be lysed or washed out within 48 h. Instead, emboli were found to translocate outside the vessel lumen within 2-7 days, leading to complete re-establishment of blood flow and sparing of the vessel. Recanalization occurred by a previously unknown mechanism of microvascular plasticity involving the rapid envelopment of emboli by endothelial membrane projections that subsequently form a new vessel wall. This was followed by the formation of an endothelial opening through which emboli translocated into the perivascular parenchyma. The rate of embolus extravasation was significantly decreased by pharmacological inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase 2/9 activity. In aged mice, extravasation was markedly delayed, resulting in persistent tissue hypoxia, synaptic damage and cell death. Alterations in the efficiency of the protective mechanism that we have identified may have important implications in microvascular pathology, stroke recovery and age-related cognitive decline.","[Lam, Carson K.; Yoo, Taehwan; Hiner, Bennett; Liu, Zhiqiang; Grutzendler, Jaime] Northwestern Univ, Dept Neurol, Feinberg Sch Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA","Grutzendler, J (reprint author), Northwestern Univ, Dept Neurol, Feinberg Sch Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA.",grutzj@northwestern.edu,"Grutzendler, Jaime/F-3691-2010",,National Institutes of Health/National Institute on Aging [AG027855]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute,"We thank S.

This involves endothelial cell proliferation as well as angiogenic sprouting, in which a subset of cells, termed tip cells, acquires motile, invasive behaviour and extends filopodial protrusions(1-3). Although it is already appreciated that angiogenesis is triggered by tissue-derived signals, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family growth factors, the resulting signalling processes in endothelial cells are only partly understood. Here we show with genetic experiments in mouse and zebrafish that ephrin-B2, a transmembrane ligand for Eph receptor tyrosine kinases, promotes sprouting behaviour and motility in the angiogenic endothelium. We link this pro-angiogenic function to a crucial role of ephrin-B2 in the VEGF signalling pathway, which we have studied in detail for VEGFR3, the receptor for VEGF-C. In the absence of ephrin-B2, the internalization of VEGFR3 in cultured cells and mutant mice is defective, which compromises downstream signal transduction by the small GTPase Rac1, Akt and the mitogen-activated protein kinase Erk. Our results show that full VEGFR3 signalling is coupled to receptor internalization. Ephrin-B2 is a key regulator of this process and thereby controls angiogenic and lymphangiogenic growth.","[Wang, Yingdi; Schmidt, Tim S.; Sakakibara, Akira; Adams, Susanne; Adams, Ralf H.] Canc Res UK London Res Inst, Vasc Dev Lab, London WC2A 3PX, England; [Nakayama, Masanori; Pitulescu, Mara E.; Bochenek, Magdalena L.; Adams, Susanne; Adams, Ralf H.] Univ Munster, Fac Med, D-48149 Munster, Germany; [Nakayama, Masanori; Pitulescu, Mara E.; Bochenek, Magdalena L.; Adams, Susanne; Adams, Ralf H.] Max Planck Inst Mol Biomed, Dept Tissue Morphogenesis, D-48149 Munster, Germany; [Bochenek, Magdalena L.; Nobes, Catherine D.] Univ Bristol, Sch Med Sci, Dept Physiol & Pharmacol, Bristol BS6 6BS, Avon, England; [Bochenek, Magdalena L.; Nobes, Catherine D.] Univ Bristol, Sch Med Sci, Dept Biochem, Bristol BS6 6BS, Avon, England; [Davy, Alice] Univ Toulouse, CNRS, CBD UMR 5547, Ctr Dev Biol, F-31062 Toulouse 9, France; [Deutsch, Urban] Univ Bern, Theodor Kocher Inst, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Luethi, Urs; Barberis, Alcide] Oncalis AG, Schlieren, Switzerland; [Benjamin, Laura E.] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Maekinen, Taija] Canc Res UK London Res Inst, Lymphat Dev Lab, London WC2A 3PX, England","Adams, RH (reprint author), Canc Res UK London Res Inst, Vasc Dev Lab, London WC2A 3PX, England.",ralf.adams@mpi-muenster.mpg.de,"Makinen, Taija/C-5765-2014; Wang, Yingdi/O-1807-2013","Makinen, Taija/0000-0002-9338-1257; ","Cancer Research UK; Max-Planck-Society; German Research Foundation [SFB 629, SPP 1190]; EMBO LTF","We thank R.

Notch-1 signalling regulates the generation of tip cells, which respond to gradients of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A)(2). The molecular cues and signalling pathways that control the guidance of tip cells are poorly understood. Bidirectional signalling by Eph receptors and ephrin ligands represents one of the most important guidance cues involved in axon path finding(3). Here we show that ephrin-B2 reverse signalling involving PDZ interactions regulates endothelial tip cell guidance to control angiogenic sprouting and branching in physiological and pathological angiogenesis. In vivo, ephrin-B2 PDZ-signalling-deficient mice (ephrin-B2DV) exhibit a reduced number of tip cells with fewer filopodial extensions at the vascular front in the mouse retina. In pathological settings, impaired PDZ signalling decreases tumour vascularization and growth. Mechanistically, we show that ephrin-B2 controls VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-2 internalization and signalling. Importantly, internalization of VEGFR2 is necessary for activation and downstream signalling of the receptor and is required for VEGF-induced tip cell filopodial extension. Together, our results suggest that ephrin-B2 at the tip cell filopodia regulates the proper spatial activation of VEGFR2 endocytosis and signalling to direct filopodial extension. Blocking ephrin-B2 reverse signalling may be an attractive alternative or combinatorial anti-angiogenic therapy strategy to disrupt VEGFR2 function in tumour angiogenesis.","[Sawamiphak, Suphansa; Essmann, Clara L.; Acker-Palmer, Amparo] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Frankfurt Inst Mol Life Sci, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany; [Sawamiphak, Suphansa; Essmann, Clara L.; Acker-Palmer, Amparo] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Cell Biol & Neurosci, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany; [Seidel, Sascha; Acker, Till] Univ Giessen, Inst Neuropathol, D-35392 Giessen, Germany; [Wilkinson, George A.] Med Coll Wisconsin, Dev Vasc Biol Program, Milwaukee, WI 53226 USA; [Pitulescu, Mara E.] Univ Munster, Fac Med, D-48149 Munster, Germany; [Pitulescu, Mara E.] Max Planck Inst Mol Biomed, Dept Tissue Morphogenesis, D-48149 Munster, Germany","Acker-Palmer, A (reprint author), Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Frankfurt Inst Mol Life Sci, Max von Laue Str 9, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany.",Acker-Palmer@bio.uni-frankfurt.de,,"Seidel, Sascha/0000-0001-9411-8795","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [AC110/3-1, 3-2, AC180/3-1, 3-2]; Deutsche Krebshilfe [107231]; Clusters of Excellence 'Macromolecular Complexes (CEF)' at University Frankfurt [EXC 115]; 'Cardio-Pulmonary System (ECCPS)' at the Universities of Giessen and Frankfurt [EXC 147]","We thank R.

During cancer progression CD95 is frequently downregulated or cells are rendered apoptosis resistant(4,5), raising the possibility that loss of CD95 is part of a mechanism for tumour evasion. However, complete loss of CD95 is rarely seen in human cancers(4) and many cancer cells express large quantities of CD95 and are highly sensitive to CD95-mediated apoptosis in vitro. Furthermore, cancer patients frequently have elevated levels of the physiological ligand for CD95, CD95L(6). These data raise the possibility that CD95 could actually promote the growth of tumours through its non-apoptotic activities(7). Here we show that cancer cells in general, regardless of their CD95 apoptosis sensitivity, depend on constitutive activity of CD95, stimulated by cancer-produced CD95L, for optimal growth. Consistently, loss of CD95 in mouse models of ovarian cancer and liver cancer reduces cancer incidence as well as the size of the tumours. The tumorigenic activity of CD95 is mediated by a pathway involving JNK and Jun. These results demonstrate that CD95 has a growth-promoting role during tumorigenesis and indicate that efforts to inhibit its activity rather than to enhance it should be considered during cancer therapy.","[Chen, Lina; Park, Sun-Mi; Hau, Annika; Feig, Christine; Peter, Marcus E.] Univ Chicago, Ben May Dept Canc Res, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Tumanov, Alexei V.; Turner, Jerrold R.; Fu, Yang-Xin] Univ Chicago, Dept Pathol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Sawada, Kenjiro; Romero, Iris L.; Lengyel, Ernst] Univ Chicago, Gynecol Oncol Sect, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Peter, ME (reprint author), Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, 303 E Super St, Chicago, IL 60611 USA.",m-peter@northwestern.edu,"Turner, Jerrold/A-6895-2009; Lengyel, Ernst/D-9220-2014; Hau, Annika/Q-2131-2015","Turner, Jerrold/0000-0003-0627-9455; Lengyel, Ernst/0000-0001-8624-1507; Hau, Annika/0000-0002-3388-3394; Peter, Marcus Ernst/0000-0003-3216-036X; fu, yang-xin/0000-0001-8441-6617; Feig, Christine/0000-0003-1385-7049","NCI [CA112240, CA11182]; Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America [CCFA 1661]; Burroughs Wellcome Fund; Ovarian Cancer Research Fund","We are grateful to A.

Recent studies have indicated an important role for phosphoinositide metabolism in the aetiology of diseases such as cancer, diabetes, myopathy and inflammation(3-5). Although the biological functions of the phosphatases that regulate phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P-3)have been well characterized, little is known about the functions of the phosphatases regulating the closely related molecule phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P-2). Here we show that inositol polyphosphate phosphatase 4A (INPP4A), a PtdIns(3,4)P2 phosphatase, is a suppressor of glutamate excitotoxicity in the central nervous system. Targeted disruption of the Inpp4a gene in mice leads to neurodegeneration in the striatum, the input nucleus of the basal ganglia that has a central role inmotor and cognitive behaviours. Notably, Inpp4a(-/-) mice show severe involuntary movement disorders. In vitro, Inpp4a gene silencing via short hairpin RNA renders cultured primary striatal neurons vulnerable to cell death mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartatetype glutamate receptors (NMDARs). Mechanistically, INPP4A is found at the postsynaptic density and regulates synaptic NMDAR localization and NMDAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic current. Thus, INPP4A protects neurons from excitotoxic cell death and thereby maintains the functional integrity of the brain. Our study demonstrates that PtdIns(3,4)P-2, PtdIns(3,4,5)P-3 and the phosphatases acting on them can have distinct regulatory roles, and provides insight into the unique aspects and physiological significance of PtdIns(3,4)P-2 metabolism. INPP4A represents, to our knowledge, the first signalling protein with a function in neurons to suppress excitotoxic cell death. The discovery of a direct link between PtdIns(3,4)P-2 metabolism and the regulation of neurodegeneration and involuntary movements may aid the development of new approaches for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.","[Sasaki, Junko; Kofuji, Satoshi; Itoh, Reietsu; Murakami, Haruka; Chida, Shinsuke; Tsuya, Yuko; Takasuga, Shunsuke; Eguchi, Satoshi; Asanuma, Ken; Sasaki, Takehiko] Akita Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Med Biol, Akita 0108543, Japan; [Sasaki, Junko; Kofuji, Satoshi; Itoh, Reietsu; Takayama, Kiyohiko; Murakami, Haruka; Chida, Shinsuke; Tsuya, Yuko; Takasuga, Shunsuke; Eguchi, Satoshi; Asanuma, Ken; Yamazaki, Masakazu; Hirai, Hirokazu; Suzuki, Akira; Sasaki, Takehiko] Gunma Univ, Global COE Program, Gunma 3718511, Japan; [Sasaki, Junko; Kofuji, Satoshi; Itoh, Reietsu; Takayama, Kiyohiko; Murakami, Haruka; Chida, Shinsuke; Tsuya, Yuko; Takasuga, Shunsuke; Eguchi, Satoshi; Asanuma, Ken; Yamazaki, Masakazu; Hirai, Hirokazu; Suzuki, Akira; Sasaki, Takehiko] Akita Univ, Gunma 3718511, Japan; [Momiyama, Toshihiko] Jikei Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol, Tokyo 1058461, Japan; [Takayama, Kiyohiko; Hirai, Hirokazu] Gunma Univ, Dept Neurophysiol, Grad Sch Med, Gunma 3718511, Japan; [Horie, Yasuo; Miura, Kouichi] Akita Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Gastroenterol & Neurol, Akita 0108543, Japan; [Davies, Elizabeth Michele; Mitchell, Christina] Monash Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Takenawa, Tadaomi] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Div Lipid Biochem, Kobe, Hyogo 6500017, Japan; [Takenawa, Tadaomi] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Med, Global COE Program, Kobe, Hyogo 6500017, Japan; [Suzuki, Akira] Kyushu Univ, Med Inst Bioregulat, Div Embryon & Genet Engn, Fukuoka 8128582, Japan","Sasaki, J (reprint author), Akita Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Med Biol, Akita 0108543, Japan.",sasakij@med.akita-u.ac.jp; tsasaki@med.akita-u.ac.jp,,"Mitchell, Christina A/0000-0001-9372-3192","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports and Technology of Japan (MEXT); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS); Japan Science and Technology Corporation (JST); Naito Foundation; Toray Science Foundation; MEXT","We thank R.

MxA partially localizes to COPI-positive membranes of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment(2). At the point of infection, it redistributes to sites of viral replication and promotes missorting of essential viral constituents(3,4). It has been proposed that the middle domain and the GTPase effector domain of dynamin-like GTPases constitute a stalk that mediates oligomerization and transmits conformational changes from the G domain to the target structure(5-7); however, the molecular architecture of this stalk has remained elusive. Here we report the crystal structure of the stalk of human MxA, which folds into a four-helical bundle. This structure tightly oligomerizes in the crystal in a criss-cross pattern involving three distinct interfaces and one loop. Mutations in each of these interaction sites interfere with native assembly, oligomerization, membrane binding and antiviral activity of MxA. On the basis of these results, we propose a structural model for dynamin oligomerization and stimulated GTP hydrolysis that is consistent with previous structural predictions and has functional implications for all members of the dynamin family.","[Gao, Song; Paeschke, Susann; Behlke, Joachim; Daumke, Oliver] Max Delbruck Ctr Mol Med, D-13125 Berlin, Germany; [Gao, Song] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Chem & Biochem, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [von der Malsburg, Alexander; Haller, Otto; Kochs, Georg] Univ Freiburg, Dept Virol, Inst Med Microbiol & Hyg, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Daumke, Oliver] Charite, Inst Med Phys & Biophys, D-10117 Berlin, Germany","Daumke, O (reprint author), Max Delbruck Ctr Mol Med, Robert Rossle Str 10, D-13125 Berlin, Germany.",oliver.daumke@mdc-berlin.de,,"Gao, Song/0000-0001-7427-6681",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB 740]; The International Human Frontier Science Program Organization; German-Israeli-Research foundation [GIF-841/04],"This project was supported by a grant of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (SFB 740-From Molecules to Modules) and by a Career Development Fellowship of 'The International Human Frontier Science Program Organization' to O.

Secretory and membrane proteins usually contain an amino-terminal signal peptide, which is recognized by the signal recognition particle (SRP) when nascent polypeptide chains emerge from the ribosome. The SRP-ribosome nascent chain complex is then targeted through its GTP-dependent interaction with SRP receptor to the protein-conducting channel on endoplasmic reticulum membrane in eukaryotes or plasma membrane in bacteria. A universally conserved component of SRP (refs 1, 2), SRP54 or its bacterial homologue, fifty-four homologue (Ffh), binds the signal peptides, which have a highly divergent sequence divisible into a positively charged n-region, an h-region commonly containing 8-20 hydrophobic residues and a polar c-region(3-5). No structure has been reported that exemplifies SRP54 binding of any signal sequence. Here we have produced a fusion protein between Sulfolobus solfataricus SRP54 (Ffh) and a signal peptide connected via a flexible linker. This fusion protein oligomerizes in solution through interaction between the SRP54 and signal peptide moieties belonging to different chains, and it is functional, as demonstrated by its ability to bind SRP RNA and SRP receptor FtsY. We present the crystal structure at 3.5 angstrom resolution of an SRP54-signal peptide complex in the dimer, which reveals how a signal sequence is recognized by SRP54.","[Janda, Claudia Y.; Li, Jade; Oubridge, Chris; Nagai, Kiyoshi] MRC, Mol Biol Lab, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England; [Hernandez, Helena; Robinson, Carol V.] Univ Cambridge, Chem Labs, Cambridge CB2 1EW, England","Nagai, K (reprint author), MRC, Mol Biol Lab, Hills Rd, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England.",kn@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk,,"Oubridge, Chris/0000-0001-8492-8305",Medical Research Council of the UK; HFSP,"We thank members of the Nagai group for assisting with data collection, O.

In plant roots the radial tissue organization is highly conserved with a central vascular cylinder in which two water conducting cell types, protoxylem and metaxylem, are patterned centripetally. We show that this patterning occurs through crosstalk between the vascular cylinder and the surrounding endodermis mediated by cell-to-cell movement of a transcription factor in one direction and microRNAs in the other. SHORT ROOT, produced in the vascular cylinder, moves into the endodermis to activate SCARECROW. Together these transcription factors activate MIR165a and MIR166b. Endodermally produced microRNA165/6 then acts to degrade its target mRNAs encoding class III homeodomain-leucine zipper transcription factors in the endodermis and stele periphery. The resulting differential distribution of target mRNA in the vascular cylinder determines xylem cell types in a dosage-dependent manner.","[Carlsbecker, Annelie; Dettmer, Jan; Lehesranta, Satu; Lindgren, Ove; Vaten, Anne; Thitamadee, Siripong; Campilho, Ana; Helariutta, Yka] Univ Helsinki, Inst Biotechnol, Dept Biosci, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Carlsbecker, Annelie; Roberts, Christina J.] Uppsala Univ, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Dept Physiol Bot, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden; [Lee, Ji-Young; Zhou, Jing; Sebastian, Jose] Cornell Univ, Boyce Thompson Inst Plant Res, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Lee, Ji-Young; Zhou, Jing] Cornell Univ, Grad Field Plant Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Lindgren, Ove] Univ Tartu, Inst Technol, EE-50411 Tartu, Estonia; [Moreno-Risueno, Miguel A.; Benfey, Philip N.] Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Moreno-Risueno, Miguel A.; Benfey, Philip N.] Duke Univ, IGSP Ctr Syst Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Bowman, John L.] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia","Helariutta, Y (reprint author), Univ Helsinki, Inst Biotechnol, Dept Biosci, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",yrjo.helariutta@helsinki.fi; philip.benfey@duke.edu,"Lee, Ji-Young/E-2196-2012; Lee, Ji-Young/F-7455-2013; Campilho, Ana/H-8790-2013; MORENO-RISUENO, MIGUEL ANGEL/J-8832-2016","Campilho, Ana/0000-0002-3470-1943; MORENO-RISUENO, MIGUEL ANGEL/0000-0002-9794-1450; Carlsbecker, Annelie/0000-0002-8450-3718; Lee, Ji-Young/0000-0002-7631-5127; Bowman, John/0000-0001-7347-3691","Boyce Thompson Institute; NSF [IOS0818071, NSF DBI-0618969]; Cornell Presidential Life Science Fellowship; NIH [RO1-GM043778]; MICINN, Spanish Government; Academy of Finland; Tekes; ESF; European Molecular Biology Organisation (EMBO) [ALTF 450-2007]; Estonian funding agencies [ETF7361, SF0180071s07]; Nilsson-Ehle Foundation; FORMAS; Carl Trygger's Foundation for Scientific Research; Triad Foundation","We thank K.

The cores of massive, short-lived stars undergo gravitational core collapse and typically eject a few solar masses during their explosion. These are thought to appear as type Ib/c and type II supernovae, and are associated with young stellar populations. In contrast, the thermonuclear detonation of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf, whose mass approaches the Chandrasekhar limit, is thought to produce type Ia supernovae(1,2). Such supernovae are observed in both young and old stellar environments. Here we report a faint type Ib supernova, SN 2005E, in the halo of the nearby isolated galaxy, NGC 1032. The 'old' environment near the supernova location, and the very low derived ejected mass (similar to 0.3 solar masses), argue strongly against a core-collapse origin. Spectroscopic observations and analysis reveal high ejecta velocities, dominated by helium-burning products, probably excluding this as a subluminous(3,4) or a regular(1) type Ia supernova. We conclude that it arises from a low-mass, old progenitor, likely to have been a helium-accreting white dwarf in a binary. The ejecta contain more calcium than observed in other types of supernovae and probably large amounts of radioactive (44)Ti.","[Perets, H.

These properties are claimed(1) to be explained by a helium detonation in a thin surface layer of an accreting white dwarf. Here we report that the observed properties of SN 2005cz, which appeared in an elliptical galaxy, resemble those of SN 2005E. We argue that these properties are best explained by a core-collapse supernova at the low-mass end (8-12 solar masses) of the range of massive stars that explode(2). Such a low-mass progenitor lost its hydrogen-rich envelope through binary interaction, had very thin oxygen-rich and silicon-rich layers above the collapsing core, and accordingly ejected a very small amount of radioactive (56)Ni and oxygen. Although the host galaxy NGC 4589 is an elliptical, some studies have revealed evidence of recent star-formation activity(3), consistent with the core-collapse model.","[Kawabata, K.

Examples range from efficient photovoltaic devices(1,2) to radio-frequency electronics(3,4) and most forms of optoelectronics(5,6). However, growing large, high quality wafers of these materials, and intimately integrating them on silicon or amorphous substrates (such as glass or plastic) is expensive, which restricts their use. Here we describe materials and fabrication concepts that address many of these challenges, through the use of films of GaAs or AlGaAs grown in thick, multilayer epitaxial assemblies, then separated from each other and distributed on foreign substrates by printing. This method yields large quantities of high quality semiconductor material capable of device integration in large area formats, in a manner that also allows the wafer to be reused for additional growths. We demonstrate some capabilities of this approach with three different applications: GaAs-based metal semiconductor field effect transistors and logic gates on plates of glass, near-infrared imaging devices on wafers of silicon, and photovoltaic modules on sheets of plastic. These results illustrate the implementation of compound semiconductors such as GaAs in applications whose cost structures, formats, area coverages or modes of use are incompatible with conventional growth or integration strategies.","[Yoon, Jongseung; Jo, Sungjin; Jung, Inhwa; Kim, Hoon-Sik; Rogers, John A.] Univ Illinois, Beckman Inst Adv Sci & Technol, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Yoon, Jongseung; Jo, Sungjin; Jung, Inhwa; Kim, Hoon-Sik; Rogers, John A.] Univ Illinois, Frederick Seitz Mat Res Lab, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Chun, Ik Su; Li, Xiuling; Coleman, James J.; Rogers, John A.] Univ Illinois, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Meitl, Matthew; Menard, Etienne] Semprius Inc, Durham, NC 27713 USA; [Jo, Sungjin; Paik, Ungyu] Hanyang Univ, WCU Dept Energy Engn, Div Mat Sci Engn, Seoul 133791, South Korea","Rogers, JA (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Beckman Inst Adv Sci & Technol, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",matt.meitl@semprius.com; upaik@hanyang.ac.kr; jrogers@uiuc.edu,"Coleman, James/C-9703-2011; Li, Xiuling/A-2240-2010; Rogers, John /L-2798-2016",,"National Security Science and Engineering Faculty; US Department of Energy, Division of Materials Sciences through the Frederick Seitz MRL and Center for Microanalysis of Materials at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign [DEFG02-91ER45439]; Division of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy [DE-FG36-08GO18021]; National Science Foundation [DMI-0328162]; Korean Ministry of Education, Science and Technology [K2070400000307A050000310]; US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-SC0001013]; Beckman Institute; Korea Research Foundation [KRF-2008-357-D00134]","We thank T.

The majority of the Earth's total energy uptake during recent decades has occurred in the upper ocean(3), but the underlying uncertainties in ocean warming are unclear, limiting our ability to assess closure of sea-level budgets(4-7), the global radiation imbalance(8) and climate models(5). For example, several teams have recently produced different multi-year estimates of the annually averaged global integral of upper-ocean heat content anomalies (hereafter OHCA curves) or, equivalently, the thermosteric sea-level rise(5,9-16). Patterns of inter-annual variability, in particular, differ among methods. Here we examine several sources of uncertainty that contribute to differences among OHCA curves from 1993 to 2008, focusing on the difficulties of correcting biases in expendable bathythermograph (XBT) data. XBT data constitute the majority of the in situ measurements of upper-ocean heat content from 1967 to 2002, and we find that the uncertainty due to choice of XBT bias correction dominates among-method variability in OHCA curves during our 1993-2008 study period. Accounting for multiple sources of uncertainty, a composite of several OHCA curves using different XBT bias corrections still yields a statistically significant linear warming trend for 1993-2008 of 0.64 W m(-2) (calculated for the Earth's entire surface area), with a 90-per-cent confidence interval of 0.53-0.75 W m(-2).","[Lyman, John M.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Joint Inst Marine & Atmospher Res, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Lyman, John M.; Johnson, Gregory C.] NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Good, Simon A.; Palmer, Matthew D.; Smith, Doug M.] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England; [Gouretski, Viktor V.] Univ Hamburg, D-20144 Hamburg, Germany; [Ishii, Masayoshi] Meteorol Res Inst, Climate Res Dept, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050052, Japan; [Ishii, Masayoshi] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Kanazawa Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan; [Willis, Josh K.] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA","Lyman, JM (reprint author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Joint Inst Marine & Atmospher Res, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",john.lyman@noaa.gov,"Johnson, Gregory/I-6559-2012","Johnson, Gregory/0000-0002-8023-4020",US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate Program Office; NOAA; DECC/Defra [GA01101],"J.M.L. and G.C.J. were funded by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate Program Office and NOAA Research.

The fit is typically poor at subduction zones, however, where regional observations of seismic anisotropy suggest that the direction of mantle flow is not parallel to(3-7) and may be several times faster than(6) plate motions. Here we present three-dimensional numerical models of buoyancy-driven deformation with realistic slab geometry for the Alaska subduction-transform system and use them to determine the origin of this regional decoupling of flow. We find that near a subduction zone edge, mantle flow velocities can have magnitudes of more than ten times the surface plate motions, whereas surface plate velocities are consistent with plate motions(8) and the complex mantle flow field is consistent with observations from seismic anisotropy(5). The seismic anisotropy observations constrain the shape of the eastern slab edge and require non-Newtonian mantle rheology. The incorporation of the non-Newtonian viscosity(9,10) results in mantle viscosities of 10(17) to 10(18) Pa s in regions of high strain rate (10(-12) s(-1)), and this low viscosity enables the mantle flow field to decouple partially from the motion of the surface plates. These results imply local rapid transport of geochemical signatures through subduction zones and that the internal deformation of slabs decreases the slab-pull force available to drive subducting plates.","[Jadamec, Margarete A.; Billen, Magali I.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Geol, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Jadamec, MA (reprint author), Monash Univ, Sch Math Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",majadamec@ucdavis.edu,"Wright, Dawn/A-4518-2011; Billen, Magali/E-7381-2013","Wright, Dawn/0000-0002-2997-7611; Billen, Magali/0000-0002-7316-1791",US National Science Foundation [EAR-0537995]; Texas Advanced Computing Center [TG-EAR080015N],"This work was supported by US National Science Foundation grant EAR-0537995.

The proposed effects of rising global temperatures on the future spread and intensification of the disease(3-5), and on existing malaria morbidity and mortality rates(3), substantively influence global health policy(6,7). The contemporary spatial limits of Plasmodium falciparum malaria and its endemicity within this range(8), when compared with comparable historical maps, offer unique insights into the changing global epidemiology of malaria over the last century. It has long been known that the range of malaria has contracted through a century of economic development and disease control(9). Here, for the first time, we quantify this contraction and the global decreases in malaria endemicity since approximately 1900. We compare the magnitude of these changes to the size of effects on malaria endemicity proposed under future climate scenarios and associated with widely used public health interventions. Our findings have two key and often ignored implications with respect to climate change and malaria. First, widespread claims that rising mean temperatures have already led to increases in worldwide malaria morbidity and mortality are largely at odds with observed decreasing global trends in both its endemicity and geographic extent. Second, the proposed future effects of rising temperatures on endemicity are at least one order of magnitude smaller than changes observed since about 1900 and up to two orders of magnitude smaller than those that can be achieved by the effective scale-up of key control measures. Predictions of an intensification of malaria in a warmer world, based on extrapolated empirical relationships or biological mechanisms, must be set against a context of a century of warming that has seen marked global declines in the disease and a substantial weakening of the global correlation between malaria endemicity and climate.","[Gething, Peter W.; Patil, Anand P.; Hay, Simon I.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Spatial Ecol & Epidemiol Grp, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Smith, David L.; Tatem, Andrew J.] Univ Florida, Emerging Pathogens Inst, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA; [Smith, David L.] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA; [Tatem, Andrew J.] Univ Florida, Dept Geog, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Snow, Robert W.] KEMRI Univ Oxford Wellcome Trust Collaborat Progr, Malaria Publ Hlth & Epidemiol Grp, Ctr Geog Med, Nairobi, Kenya; [Snow, Robert W.] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Clin Med, Ctr Trop Med, CCVTM, Oxford OX3 7LJ, England","Hay, SI (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Spatial Ecol & Epidemiol Grp, Tinbergen Bldg,S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PS, England.",peter.gething@zoo.ox.ac.uk; simon.hay@zoo.ox.ac.uk,"Smith, David/L-8850-2013; Hay, Simon/F-8967-2015","Smith, David/0000-0003-4367-3849; Hay, Simon/0000-0002-0611-7272; Gething, Peter/0000-0001-6759-5449; Snow, Robert/0000-0003-3725-6088","Wellcome Trust [079091, 079080]; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [49446]; Science & Technology Directorate, Department of Homeland Security; Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health; Wellcome Trust, UK","We thank A.

Here we show that the serine protease Esp(2,3) secreted by a subset of Staphylococcus epidermidis, a commensal bacterium, inhibits biofilm formation and nasal colonization by Staphylococcus aureus, a human pathogen(4). Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that the presence of Esp-secreting S. epidermidis in the nasal cavities of human volunteers correlates with the absence of S. aureus. Purified Esp inhibits biofilm formation and destroys pre-existing S. aureus biofilms. Furthermore, Esp enhances the susceptibility of S. aureus in biofilms to immune system components. In vivo studies have shown that Esp-secreting S. epidermidis eliminates S. aureus nasal colonization. These findings indicate that Esp hinders S. aureus colonization in vivo through a novel mechanism of bacterial interference, which could lead to the development of novel therapeutics to prevent S. aureus colonization and infection.","[Iwase, Tadayuki; Shinji, Hitomi; Tajima, Akiko; Mizunoe, Yoshimitsu] Jikei Univ, Sch Med, Dept Bacteriol, Tokyo 1058461, Japan; [Takada, Koji] Jikei Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, Tokyo 1058461, Japan; [Agata, Toshihiko] Jikei Univ, Sch Med, Dept Environm Hlth, Tokyo 1058461, Japan; [Uehara, Yoshio; Seo, Hiromi] Kochi Med Sch, Dept Gen Med, Nankoku, Kochi 7838505, Japan","Iwase, T (reprint author), Jikei Univ, Sch Med, Dept Bacteriol, Tokyo 1058461, Japan.",iwase.tadayuki@jikei.ac.jp,,,Jikei University,"We thank K.

Rare individuals ('elite controllers') maintain very low levels of HIV RNA without therapy, thereby making disease progression and transmission unlikely. Certain HLA class I alleles are markedly enriched in elite controllers, with the highest association observed for HLA-B57 (ref. 1). Because HLA molecules present viral peptides that activate CD8(+) T cells, an immune-mediated mechanism is probably responsible for superior control of HIV. Here we describe how the peptide-binding characteristics of HLA-B57 molecules affect thymic development such that, compared to other HLA-restricted T cells, a larger fraction of the naive repertoire of B57-restricted clones recognizes a viral epitope, and these T cells are more cross-reactive to mutants of targeted epitopes. Our calculations predict that such a T-cell repertoire imposes strong immune pressure on immunodominant HIV epitopes and emergent mutants, thereby promoting efficient control of the virus. Supporting these predictions, in a large cohort of HLA-typed individuals, our experiments show that the relative ability of HLA-B alleles to control HIV correlates with their peptide-binding characteristics that affect thymic development. Our results provide a conceptual framework that unifies diverse empirical observations, and have implications for vaccination strategies.","[Kosmrlj, Andrej; Read, Elizabeth L.; Allen, Todd M.; Altfeld, Marcus; Pereyra, Florencia; Carrington, Mary; Walker, Bruce D.; Chakraborty, Arup K.] Ragon Inst MGH MIT & Harvard, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Kosmrlj, Andrej] MIT, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Read, Elizabeth L.; Chakraborty, Arup K.] MIT, Dept Chem Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Read, Elizabeth L.; Chakraborty, Arup K.] MIT, Dept Chem, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Qi, Ying; Carrington, Mary] NCI Frederick, Canc & Inflammat Program, Expt Immunol Lab, SAIC Frederick Inc, Frederick, MD 21702 USA; [Deeks, Steven G.] Univ Calif San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94110 USA; [Walker, Bruce D.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chevy Chase, MD 20815 USA; [Chakraborty, Arup K.] MIT, Dept Biol Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Chakraborty, AK (reprint author), Ragon Inst MGH MIT & Harvard, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",bwalker@partners.org; arupc@mit.edu,"Allen, Todd/F-5473-2011",,"Mark and Lisa Schwartz Foundation; National Institutes of Health (NIH); Philip T and Susan M Ragon Foundation; Jane Coffin Childs Foundation; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; NIAID; National Cancer Institute, NIH [HHSN261200800001E]; NIH, National Cancer Institute, Center for Cancer Research","Financial support was provided by the Mark and Lisa Schwartz Foundation, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Director's Pioneer award (A.

Here we show that Shigella flexneri, which causes dysentery, encounters varying oxygen concentrations in the gastrointestinal tract, which govern activity of its type three secretion system (T3SS). The T3SS is essential for cell invasion and virulence(1). In anaerobic environments (for example, the gastrointestinal tract lumen), Shigella is primed for invasion and expresses extended T3SS needles while reducing Ipa (invasion plasmid antigen) effector secretion. This is mediated by FNR (fumarate and nitrate reduction), a regulator of anaerobic metabolism that represses transcription of spa32 and spa33, virulence genes that regulate secretion through the T3SS. We demonstrate there is a zone of relative oxygenation adjacent to the gastrointestinal tract mucosa, caused by diffusion from the capillary network at the tips of villi. This would reverse the anaerobic block of Ipa secretion, allowing T3SS activation at its precise site of action, enhancing invasion and virulence.","[Marteyn, Benoit; West, Nicholas P.; Tang, Christoph M.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Microbiol, Ctr Mol Microbiol & Infect, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Browning, Douglas F.; Cole, Jeffery A.] Univ Birmingham, Sch Biosci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Shaw, Jonathan G.] Univ Sheffield, Sch Med, Div Genom Med, Sheffield S10 2RX, S Yorkshire, England; [Palm, Fredrik] Uppsala Univ, Biomed Ctr, Dept Med Cell Biol, S-75123 Uppsala, Sweden; [Mounier, Joelle; Sansonetti, Philippe] Inst Pasteur, INSERM, U786, F-75724 Paris 15, France; [Mounier, Joelle; Sansonetti, Philippe] Inst Pasteur, Unite Pathogenie Microbienne Mol, F-75724 Paris 15, France; [Sansonetti, Philippe] Coll France, F-75231 Paris 05, France","Tang, CM (reprint author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Microbiol, Ctr Mol Microbiol & Infect, Flowers Bldg, London SW7 2AZ, England.",psanson@pasteur.fr; c.tang@imperial.ac.uk,"West, Nicholas/C-3119-2008","Marteyn, Benoit/0000-0001-5638-702X",Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale; Royal Society; ERC; European Union [QLRT-1999-00938]; Wellcome Trust; Medical Research Council,"This work was supported by the Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale, the Royal Society, an ERC Advanced Grant (HOMEOEPITH), and the European Union (QLRT-1999-00938).

This process regulates various cellular functions such as plasma membrane repair in plants and animals(2,3), the discharge of defensive spikes in Paramecium 4, and the secretion of insulin from pancreatic cells, immune modulators from lymphocytes, and chemical transmitters from neurons(5). In animal cells, serine/threonine kinases including cAMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C and calmodulin kinases have been implicated in calcium-signal transduction leading to regulated secretion(1,6,7). Although plants and protozoa also regulate secretion by means of intracellular calcium, the method by which these signals are relayed has not been explained. Here we show that the Toxoplasma gondii calcium-dependent protein kinase 1 (TgCDPK1) is an essential regulator of calcium-dependent exocytosis in this opportunistic human pathogen. Conditional suppression of TgCDPK1 revealed that it controls calcium-dependent secretion of specialized organelles called micronemes, resulting in a block of essential phenotypes including parasite motility, host-cell invasion, and egress. These phenotypes were recapitulated by using a chemical biology approach in which pyrazolopyrimidine-derived compounds specifically inhibited TgCDPK1 and disrupted the parasite's life cycle at stages dependent on microneme secretion. Inhibition was specific to TgCDPK1, because expression of a resistant mutant kinase reversed sensitivity to the inhibitor. TgCDPK1 is conserved among apicomplexans and belongs to a family of kinases shared with plants and ciliates(8), suggesting that related CDPKs may have a function in calcium-regulated secretion in other organisms. Because this kinase family is absent from mammalian hosts, it represents a validated target that may be exploitable for chemotherapy against T. gondii and related apicomplexans.","[Lourido, Sebastian; Shuman, Joel; Sibley, L.

Interphase chromosomes are not positioned randomly within the nucleus, but instead adopt preferred conformations(4-7). Disparate DNA elements co-localize into functionally defined aggregates or 'factories' for transcription(8) and DNA replication(9). In budding yeast, Drosophila and many other eukaryotes, chromosomes adopt a Rabl configuration, with arms extending from centromeres adjacent to the spindle pole body to telomeres that abut the nuclear envelope(10-12). Nonetheless, the topologies and spatial relationships of chromosomes remain poorly understood. Here we developed a method to globally capture intra-and inter-chromosomal interactions, and applied it to generate a map at kilobase resolution of the haploid genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The map recapitulates known features of genome organization, thereby validating the method, and identifies new features. Extensive regional and higher order folding of individual chromosomes is observed. Chromosome XII exhibits a striking conformation that implicates the nucleolus as a formidable barrier to interaction between DNA sequences at either end. Inter-chromosomal contacts are anchored by centromeres and include interactions among transfer RNA genes, among origins of early DNA replication and among sites where chromosomal breakpoints occur. Finally, we constructed a three-dimensional model of the yeast genome. Our findings provide a glimpse of the interface between the form and function of a eukaryotic genome.","[Duan, Zhijun; Kim, Yoo Jung; Blau, C.

Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin is a major complication of treatment with these drugs, with a 65 to 100-fold higher risk than in the normal population(1). By contrast, the incidence of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), the other major keratinocyte-derived tumour of the skin, of melanoma and of internal malignancies increases to a significantly lesser extent(1). Here we report that genetic and pharmacological suppression of calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) function promotes tumour formation in mouse skin and in xenografts, in immune compromised mice, of H-ras(V12) (also known as Hras1)-expressing primary human keratinocytes or keratinocyte-derived SCC cells. Calcineurin/NFAT inhibition counteracts p53 (also known as TRP53)-dependent cancer cell senescence, thereby increasing tumorigenic potential. ATF3, a member of the 'enlarged' AP-1 family, is selectively induced by calcineurin/NFAT inhibition, both under experimental conditions and in clinically occurring tumours, and increased ATF3 expression accounts for suppression of p53-dependent senescence and enhanced tumorigenic potential. Thus, intact calcineurin/NFAT signalling is critically required for p53 and senescence-associated mechanisms that protect against skin squamous cancer development.","[Wu, Xunwei; Nguyen, Bach-Cuc; Chang, Sungeun; Brooks, Yang; Dotto, G.

Although ADF/cofilin proteins have been shown to contribute to actin disassembly(3), it is not clear how activity of these locally acting proteins could be coordinated over the distance scale of the whole cell. Here we show that non-muscle myosin II has a direct role in actin network disassembly in crawling cells. In fish keratocytes undergoing motility, myosin II is concentrated in regions at the rear with high rates of network disassembly. Activation of myosin II by ATP in detergent-extracted cytoskeletons results in rear-localized disassembly of the actin network. Inhibition of myosin II activity and stabilization of actin filaments synergistically impede cell motility, suggesting the existence of two disassembly pathways, one of which requires myosin II activity. Our results establish the importance of myosin II as an enzyme for actin network disassembly; we propose that gradual formation and reorganization of an actomyosin network provides an intrinsic destruction timer, enabling long-range coordination of actin network treadmilling in motile cells.","[Wilson, Cyrus A.; Tsuchida, Mark A.; Allen, Greg M.; Barnhart, Erin L.; Yam, Patricia T.; Keren, Kinneret; Theriot, Julie A.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Wilson, Cyrus A.; Tsuchida, Mark A.; Allen, Greg M.; Barnhart, Erin L.; Yam, Patricia T.; Keren, Kinneret; Theriot, Julie A.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Applegate, Kathryn T.; Ji, Lin; Danuser, Gaudenz] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Cell Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Theriot, Julie A.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Theriot, JA (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",theriot@stanford.edu,"Tsuchida, Mark/B-8180-2008","Tsuchida, Mark/0000-0003-4048-6220; Yam, Patricia/0000-0002-3631-3151","National Institutes of Health [R01AI067712, T32GM007276, U54GM64346, U01GM67230]; Stanford Medical Scientist Training Program; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Stanford Graduate Fellowship; Skye International Foundation; National Science Foundation; Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation (DRG) [1854-05]","We thank M.

Phosphorylation of eIF2 [eIF2(alpha P)] is critical for translational control in diverse settings including nutrient deprivation, viral infection and memory formation(3-5). eIF5 functions in start site selection as a GTPase accelerating protein (GAP) for the eIF2.GTP.tRNA(i)(Met) ternary complex within the ribosome-bound pre-initiation complex(6-8). Here we define new regulatory functions of eIF5 in the recycling of eIF2 from its inactive eIF2.GDP state between successive rounds of translation initiation. First we show that eIF5 stabilizes the binding of GDP to eIF2 and is therefore a bi-functional protein that acts as a GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI). We find that this activity is independent of the GAP function and identify conserved residues within eIF5 that are necessary for this role. Second we show that eIF5 is a critical component of the eIF2(alpha P) regulatory complex that inhibits the activity of the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) eIF2B. Together our studies define a new step in the translation initiation pathway, one that is critical for normal translational controls.","[Jennings, Martin D.; Pavitt, Graham D.] Univ Manchester, Fac Life Sci, Manchester M13 9PT, Lancs, England","Pavitt, GD (reprint author), Univ Manchester, Fac Life Sci, Michael Smith Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PT, Lancs, England.",graham.pavitt@manchester.ac.uk,"Pavitt, Graham/A-1363-2010; Jennings, martin/E-5240-2010","Pavitt, Graham/0000-0002-8593-2418; ","BBSRC [BB/E002005/1, BB/H010599/1]","We thank K.

It remains controversial whether iPSCs are molecularly and functionally equivalent to blastocyst-derived embryonic stem (ES) cells. By comparing genetically identical mouse ES cells and iPSCs, we show here that their overall messenger RNA and microRNA expression patterns are indistinguishable with the exception of a few transcripts encoded within the imprinted Dlk1-Dio3 gene cluster on chromosome 12qF1, which were aberrantly silenced in most of the iPSC clones. Consistent with a developmental role of the Dlk1-Dio3 gene cluster, these iPSC clones contributed poorly to chimaeras and failed to support the development of entirely iPSC-derived animals ('all-iPSC mice'). In contrast, iPSC clones with normal expression of the Dlk1-Dio3 cluster contributed to high-grade chimaeras and generated viable all-iPSC mice. Notably, treatment of an iPSC clone that had silenced Dlk1-Dio3 with a histone deacetylase inhibitor reactivated the locus and rescued its ability to support full-term development of all-iPSC mice. Thus, the expression state of a single imprinted gene cluster seems to distinguish most murine iPSCs from ES cells and allows for the prospective identification of iPSC clones that have the full development potential of ES cells.","[Stadtfeld, Matthias; Apostolou, Effie; Follett, Patricia; Hochedlinger, Konrad] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Ctr Regenerat Med, Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Stadtfeld, Matthias; Apostolou, Effie; Shioda, Toshi; Hochedlinger, Konrad] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Canc, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Stadtfeld, Matthias; Apostolou, Effie; Shioda, Toshi; Hochedlinger, Konrad] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Stadtfeld, Matthias; Apostolou, Effie; Hochedlinger, Konrad] Harvard Univ, Dept Stem Cell & Regenerat Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Stadtfeld, Matthias; Apostolou, Effie; Hochedlinger, Konrad] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Akutsu, Hidenori] Natl Inst Child Hlth & Dev, Dept Reprod Biol, Tokyo 1578535, Japan; [Fukuda, Atsushi; Kono, Tomohiro] Tokyo Univ Agr, Dept Biosci, Tokyo 1568502, Japan; [Natesan, Sridaran] Sanofi Aventis, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Hochedlinger, K (reprint author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Ctr Regenerat Med, Harvard Stem Cell Inst, 185 Cambridge St, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",khochedlinger@helix.mgh.harvard.edu,,"Stadtfeld, Matthias/0000-0002-5852-9906",Schering Foundation; Jane Coffin Childs postdoctoral fellowship; NIH; Harvard Stem Cell Institute; MGH; HHMI,"We are grateful to H.

We identified similar to 12,000 neuronal activity-regulated enhancers that are bound by the general transcriptional co-activator CBP in an activity-dependent manner. A function of CBP at enhancers may be to recruit RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), as we also observed activity-regulated RNAPII binding to thousands of enhancers. Notably, RNAPII at enhancers transcribes bi-directionally a novel class of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) within enhancer domains defined by the presence of histone H3 monomethylated at lysine 4. The level of eRNA expression at neuronal enhancers positively correlates with the level of messenger RNA synthesis at nearby genes, suggesting that eRNA synthesis occurs specifically at enhancers that are actively engaged in promoting mRNA synthesis. These findings reveal that a widespread mechanism of enhancer activation involves RNAPII binding and eRNA synthesis.","[Kim, Tae-Kyung; Gray, Jesse M.; Costa, Allen M.; Bear, Daniel M.; Harmin, David A.; Laptewicz, Mike; Markenscoff-Papadimitriou, Eirene; Greenberg, Michael E.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Hemberg, Martin; Kreiman, Gabriel] Harvard Univ, Childrens Hosp Boston, Dept Ophthalmol, Ctr Brain Sci, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Hemberg, Martin; Kreiman, Gabriel] Harvard Univ, Swartz Ctr Theoret Neurosci, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Wu, Jing; Worley, Paul F.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Solomon H Snyder Dept Neurosci, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Harmin, David A.] Harvard Mit Div Hlth Sci & Technol, Childrens Hosp Informat Program, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Barbara-Haley, Kellie] Childrens Hosp, Mol Genet Core Facil, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Kuersten, Scott] Epictr Biotechnol, Madison, WI 53713 USA; [Kuhl, Dietmar] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf UKE, Ctr Mol Neurobiol ZMNH, IMCC, D-20251 Hamburg, Germany; [Bito, Haruhiko] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Med, Dept Neurochem, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan","Greenberg, ME (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, 220 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",michael_greenberg@hms.harvard.edu,"Bito, Haruhiko/A-8635-2008; Kuhl, Dietmar/A-4689-2009","Kuhl, Dietmar/0000-0002-4772-6701","Nancy Lurie Marks Family Foundation; National Institutes of Health [NS028829, R21EY019710, DP2OD006461, MH-053608]; Lefler postdoctoral fellowship; Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Funds; Helen Hay Whitney postdoctoral fellowship; Children's Hospital Ophthalmology Foundation; Whitehall Foundation; Klingenstein Fund","We thank members of the Greenberg laboratory for discussions and for critical reading of the manuscript.

One possible explanation is that as white dwarfs cool, one of the ashes of helium burning, (22)Ne, sinks in the deep interior of these stars(3-5). At lower temperatures, white dwarfs are expected to crystallize and phase separation of the main constituents of the core of a typical white dwarf ((12)C and (16)O) is expected to occur(6,7).

Typically, the interactions between microscopic particles are described as two-body interactions. However, it has been shown that higher-order multi-body interactions could give rise to novel quantum phases with intriguing properties. So far, multi-body interactions have been observed as inelastic loss resonances in three-and four-body recombinations of atom-atom and atom-molecule collisions(4-6). Here we demonstrate the presence of effective multi-body interactions(7) in a system of ultracold bosonic atoms in a three-dimensional optical lattice, emerging through virtual transitions of particles from the lowest energy band to higher energy bands. We observe such interactions up to the six-body case in time-resolved traces of quantum phase revivals(8-11), using an atom interferometric technique that allows us to precisely measure the absolute energies of atom number states at a lattice site. In addition, we show that the spectral content of these time traces can reveal the atom number statistics at a lattice site, similar to foundational experiments in cavity quantum electrodynamics that yield the statistics of a cavity photon field(12). Our precision measurement of multi-body interaction energies provides crucial input for the comparison of optical-lattice quantum simulators with many-body quantum theory.","[Will, Sebastian; Best, Thorsten; Schneider, Ulrich; Hackermueller, Lucia; Bloch, Immanuel] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Phys, D-55099 Mainz, Germany; [Will, Sebastian; Schneider, Ulrich; Bloch, Immanuel] Univ Munich, Fac Phys, D-80799 Munich, Germany; [Luehmann, Dirk-Soeren] Univ Hamburg, Inst Theoret Phys, D-20355 Hamburg, Germany; [Bloch, Immanuel] Max Planck Inst Quantum Opt, D-85748 Garching, Germany","Will, S (reprint author), Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Phys, D-55099 Mainz, Germany.",sebastian.will@lmu.de,"Will, Sebastian/B-8933-2011; Bloch, Immanuel/G-3174-2010; Schneider, Ulrich/N-4820-2015","Will, Sebastian/0000-0003-2672-5264; Bloch, Immanuel/0000-0002-0679-4759; Schneider, Ulrich/0000-0003-4345-9498","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; European Union, EuroQUAM; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency; US Air Force Office of Scientific Research, MATCOR; Gutenberg Akademie","This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, the European Union (Integrated Project SCALA), EuroQUAM (L.

Self-assembly can achieve this task efficiently, but may be subject to thermodynamic and kinetic limitations: reactants, intermediates and products may collide with each other throughout the assembly time course to produce non-target species instead of target species. An alternative approach to nanoscale assembly uses information-containing molecules such as DNA(1) to control interactions and thereby minimize unwanted cross-talk between different components. In principle, this method should allow the stepwise and programmed construction of target products by linking individually selected nanoscale components-much as an automobile is built on an assembly line. Here we demonstrate that a nanoscale assembly line can be realized by the judicious combination of three known DNA-based modules: a DNA origami(2) tile that provides a framework and track for the assembly process, cassettes containing three independently controlled two-state DNA machines that serve as programmable cargo-donating devices(3,4) and are attached(4,5) in series to the tile, and a DNA walker that can move on the track from device to device and collect cargo. As the walker traverses the pathway prescribed by the origami tile track, it sequentially encounters the three DNA devices, each of which can be independently switched between an 'ON' state, allowing its cargo to be transferred to the walker, and an 'OFF' state, in which no transfer occurs. We use three different types of gold nanoparticle species as cargo and show that the experimental system does indeed allow the controlled fabrication of the eight different products that can be obtained with three two-state devices.","[Gu, Hongzhou; Seeman, Nadrian C.] NYU, Dept Chem, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Chao, Jie; Xiao, Shou-Jun] Nanjing Univ, State Key Lab Coordinat Chem, Sch Chem & Chem Engn, Nanjing Natl Lab Microstruct, Nanjing 210093, Peoples R China","Seeman, NC (reprint author), NYU, Dept Chem, New York, NY 10003 USA.",ned.seeman@nyu.edu,"Gu, Hongzhou/H-5308-2011; Xiao, Shou-Jun /K-7718-2012; Chao, Jie/G-3157-2017","Chao, Jie/0000-0003-1030-9944; Gu, Hongzhou/0000-0001-5058-4815","US National Institute of General Medical Sciences [GM-29544]; US National Science Foundation [CTS-0608889, CCF-0726378]; US Army Research Office [48681-EL, W911NF-07-1-0439]; US Office of Naval Research [N000140910181, N000140911118]; W.

Moving robotics to the single-molecule level is possible in principle, but requires facing the limited ability of individual molecules to store complex information and programs. One strategy to overcome this problem is to use systems that can obtain complex behaviour from the interaction of simple robots with their environment(2-4). A first step in this direction was the development of DNA walkers(5), which have developed from being non-autonomous(6,7) to being capable of directed but brief motion on one-dimensional tracks(8-11). Here we demonstrate that previously developed random walkers(12)-so-called molecular spiders that comprise a streptavidin molecule as an inert 'body' and three deoxyribozymes as catalytic 'legs'-show elementary robotic behaviour when interacting with a precisely defined environment. Single-molecule microscopy observations confirm that such walkers achieve directional movement by sensing and modifying tracks of substrate molecules laid out on a two-dimensional DNA origami landscape(13). When using appropriately designed DNA origami, the molecular spiders autonomously carry out sequences of actions such as 'start', 'follow', 'turn' and 'stop'. We anticipate that this strategy will result in more complex robotic behaviour at the molecular level if additional control mechanisms are incorporated. One example might be interactions between multiple molecular robots leading to collective behaviour(14,15); another might be the ability to read and transform secondary cues on the DNA origami landscape as a means of implementing Turing-universal algorithmic behaviour(2,16,17).","[Taylor, Steven; Pei, Renjun; Stojanovic, Milan N.] Columbia Univ, Dept Med, Div Expt Therapeut, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Lund, Kyle; Nangreave, Jeanette; Yan, Hao] Arizona State Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Lund, Kyle; Nangreave, Jeanette; Yan, Hao] Arizona State Univ, Biodesign Inst, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Manzo, Anthony J.; Michelotti, Nicole; Johnson-Buck, Alexander; Walter, Nils G.] Univ Michigan, Dept Chem, Single Mol Anal Grp, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Dabby, Nadine; Winfree, Erik] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Michelotti, Nicole] Univ Michigan, Dept Phys, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Stojanovic, Milan N.] Columbia Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, New York, NY 10032 USA","Stojanovic, MN (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Dept Med, Div Expt Therapeut, New York, NY 10032 USA.",mns18@columbia.edu; nwalter@umich.edu; winfree@caltech.edu; hao.yan@asu.edu,"Winfree, Erik/L-4002-2013; Walter, Nils/G-7504-2016","Winfree, Erik/0000-0002-5899-7523; Walter, Nils/0000-0002-7301-1275",US National Science Foundation (NSF) EMT; US National Science Foundation (NSF) CBC; Kinship Foundation (Searle); Leukemia & Lymphoma Society; Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation; NSF ITR; US Army Research Office; NSF; US Office of Naval Research; US National Institutes of Health; US Department of Energy; Sloan Research Fellowship; NIH,"This research was supported by the US National Science Foundation (NSF) EMT and CBC grants (all authors); fellowships and grants from the Kinship Foundation (Searle), the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and NSF ITR (M.N.S.); awards from the US Army Research Office, the NSF, the US Office of Naval Research, the US National Institutes of Health, the US Department of Energy and a Sloan Research Fellowship (H.Y.); an NSF Graduate Fellowship (N.D.); and Molecular Biophysics and Microfluidics in Biomedical Sciences Training Fellowships from the NIH (A.J.-B. and N.M., respectively).

This balance is thought to have stabilized greenhouse conditions within a range that ensured habitable conditions(1). Changes in this balance have been attributed to changes in topographic relief, where varying rates of continental rock weathering and erosion(1,2) are superimposed on fluctuations in organic carbon burial(3). Geological strata provide an indirect yet imperfectly preserved record of this change through changing rates of sedimentation(1,2,4). Widespread observations of a recent (0-5-Myr) fourfold increase in global sedimentation rates require a global mechanism to explain them(4-6). Accelerated uplift and global cooling have been given as possible causes(2,4,6,7), but because of the links between rates of erosion and the correlated rate of weathering(8,9), an increase in the drawdown of CO(2) that is predicted to follow may be the cause of global climate change instead(2). However, globally, rates of uplift cannot increase everywhere in the way that apparent sedimentation rates do(4,10). Moreover, proxy records of past atmospheric CO(2) provide no evidence for this large reduction in recent CO(2) concentrations(11,12). Here we question whether this increase in global weathering and erosion actually occurred and whether the apparent increase in the sedimentation rate is due to observational biases in the sedimentary record(13). As evidence, we recast the ocean dissolved (10)Be/(9)Be isotope system as a weathering proxy spanning the past similar to 12 Myr (ref. 14). This proxy indicates stable weathering fluxes during the late-Cenozoic era. The sum of these observations shows neither clear evidence for increased erosion nor clear evidence for a pulse in weathered material to the ocean. We conclude that processes different from an increase in denudation caused Cenozoic global cooling, and that global cooling had no profound effect on spatially and temporally averaged weathering rates.","[Willenbring, Jane K.; von Blanckenburg, Friedhelm] Deutsch GeoForschungsZentrum, Sect Earth Surface Geochem 3 4, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany","von Blanckenburg, F (reprint author), Deutsch GeoForschungsZentrum, Sect Earth Surface Geochem 3 4, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany.",jane.willenbring@sas.upenn.edu; fvb@gfz-potsdam.de,"Willenbring, Jane/B-6431-2011; von Blanckenburg, Friedhelm/K-4711-2013","Willenbring, Jane/0000-0003-2722-9537; von Blanckenburg, Friedhelm/0000-0002-2964-717X",Alexander von Humboldt Postdoctoral Fellowship,J.K.W. gratefully acknowledges an Alexander von Humboldt Postdoctoral Fellowship.,,30,145,149,9,147,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-May,2010,465,7295,,,,,211,214,,10.1038/nature09044,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,594SS,WOS:000277558500033,20463736.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,friedhelm,von blanckenburg,male,1,6,TWJUQHYAAAAJ,9446

The disappearance of faunas of Burgess Shale type curtails the stratigraphic record of a number of iconic Cambrian taxa. One possible explanation for this loss is a major extinction(2,3), but more probably it reflects the absence of preservation of similar soft-bodied faunas in later periods(4). Here we report the discovery of numerous diverse soft-bodied assemblages in the Lower and Upper Fezouata Formations (Lower Ordovician) of Morocco, which include a range of remarkable stem-group morphologies normally considered characteristic of the Cambrian. It is clear that biotas of Burgess Shale type persisted after the Cambrian and are preserved where suitable facies occur.

As first suggested by Darwin(2), the theory of UCA posits that all extant terrestrial organisms share a common genetic heritage, each being the genealogical descendant of a single species from the distant past(3-6). The classic evidence for UCA, although massive, is largely restricted to 'local' common ancestry-for example, of specific phyla rather than the entirety of life-and has yet to fully integrate the recent advances from modern phylogenetics and probability theory. Although UCA is widely assumed, it has rarely been subjected to formal quantitative testing(7-10), and this has led to critical commentary emphasizing the intrinsic technical difficulties in empirically evaluating a theory of such broad scope(1,5,8,9,11-15). Furthermore, several researchers have proposed that early life was characterized by rampant horizontal gene transfer, leading some to question the monophyly of life(11,14,15). Here I provide the first, to my knowledge, formal, fundamental test of UCA, without assuming that sequence similarity implies genetic kinship. I test UCA by applying model selection theory(5,16,17) to molecular phylogenies, focusing on a set of ubiquitously conserved proteins that are proposed to be orthologous. Among a wide range of biological models involving the independent ancestry of major taxonomic groups, the model selection tests are found to overwhelmingly support UCA irrespective of the presence of horizontal gene transfer and symbiotic fusion events. These results provide powerful statistical evidence corroborating the monophyly of all known life.","Brandeis Univ, Dept Biochem, Waltham, MA 01778 USA","Theobald, DL (reprint author), Brandeis Univ, Dept Biochem, Waltham, MA 01778 USA.",dtheobald@brandeis.edu,"Theobald, Douglas/F-3514-2013","Theobald, Douglas/0000-0002-2695-8343",,,,36,82,85,4,84,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,13-May,2010,465,7295,,,,,219,U104,,10.1038/nature09014,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,594SS,WOS:000277558500035,20463738.0,No,,,11/20/17,douglas l.,theobald,na,na,na,na,na

Most cases of ALS are sporadic, but about 10% are familial. Genes known to cause classic familial ALS (FALS) are superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1)(2), ANG encoding angiogenin(3), TARDP encoding transactive response (TAR) DNA-binding protein TDP-43 (ref. 4) and fused in sarcoma/translated in liposarcoma (FUS, also known as TLS)(5,6). However, these genetic defects occur in only about 20-30% of cases of FALS, and most genes causing FALS are unknown. Here we show that there are mutations in the gene encoding optineurin (OPTN), earlier reported to be a causative gene of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG)(7), in patients with ALS. We found three types of mutation of OPTN: a homozygous deletion of exon 5, a homozygous Q398X nonsense mutation and a heterozygous E478G missense mutation within its ubiquitin-binding domain. Analysis of cell transfection showed that the nonsense and missense mutations of OPTN abolished the inhibition of activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B), and the E478G mutation revealed a cytoplasmic distribution different from that of the wild type or a POAG mutation. A case with the E478G mutation showed OPTN-immunoreactive cytoplasmic inclusions. Furthermore, TDP-43- or SOD1-positive inclusions of sporadic and SOD1 cases of ALS were also noticeably immunolabelled by anti-OPTN antibodies. Our findings strongly suggest that OPTN is involved in the pathogenesis of ALS. They also indicate that NF-kB inhibitors could be used to treat ALS and that transgenic mice bearing various mutations of OPTN will be relevant in developing new drugs for this disorder.","[Maruyama, Hirofumi; Morino, Hiroyuki; Kamada, Masaki; Kawakami, Hideshi] Hiroshima Univ, Dept Epidemiol, Res Inst Radiat Biol & Med, Hiroshima 7348553, Japan; [Ito, Hidefumi; Kinoshita, Yoshimi; Kusaka, Hirofumi] Kansai Med Univ, Dept Neurol, Moriguchi, Osaka 5708506, Japan; [Izumi, Yuishin; Kamada, Masaki; Nodera, Hiroyuki; Kaji, Ryuji] Univ Tokushima, Grad Sch, Dept Clin Neurosci, Tokushima 7708503, Japan; [Kato, Hidemasa] Saitama Med Univ, Res Ctr Genom Med, Div Dev Biol, Saitama 3501241, Japan; [Watanabe, Yasuhito] Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Biomed Sci, Lab Integrat Biosci, Hiroshima 7348553, Japan; [Suzuki, Hidenori] Hiroshima Bunkyo Womens Univ, Fac Human Sci, Hiroshima 7310295, Japan; [Komure, Osamu] S Osaka Neurosurg Hosp, Osakasayama 5890011, Japan; [Matsuura, Shinya] Hiroshima Univ, Res Inst Radiat Biol & Med, Dept Genet & Cell Biol, Hiroshima 7348553, Japan; [Kobatake, Keitaro] Kobatake Hosp, Dept Neurol, Fukuyama, Hiroshima 7201142, Japan; [Morimoto, Nobutoshi; Abe, Koji] Okayama Univ, Grad Sch Med Dent & Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Neurol, Okayama 7008558, Japan; [Suzuki, Naoki; Aoki, Masashi] Tohoku Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Sendai, Miyagi 9808574, Japan; [Kawata, Akihiro; Hirai, Takeshi] Tokyo Metropolitan Neurol Hosp, Dept Neurol, Tokyo 1830042, Japan; [Kato, Takeo] Yamagata Univ, Fac Med, Dept Neurol Haematol Metab Endocrinol & Diabetol, Yamagata 9909585, Japan; [Ogasawara, Kazumasa] Shiga Univ Med Sci, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Otsu, Shiga 5202192, Japan; [Hirano, Asao] Montefiore Med Ctr, Dept Pathol, Div Neuropathol, New York, NY 10467 USA; [Hagiwara, Koichi] Saitama Med Univ, Dept Resp Med, Saitama 3500495, Japan","Kawakami, H (reprint author), Hiroshima Univ, Dept Epidemiol, Res Inst Radiat Biol & Med, Hiroshima 7348553, Japan.",hkawakam@hiroshima-u.ac.jp,"Kawakami, Hideshi/A-2086-2009; Maruyama, Hirofumi/B-9333-2011; Morino, Hiroyuki/H-9583-2013","Kawakami, Hideshi/0000-0002-1405-0901; Maruyama, Hirofumi/0000-0001-7613-8717; Morino, Hiroyuki/0000-0002-5190-3547; Suzuki, Naoki/0000-0001-8880-8554","Ministry of Education, Science, and Culture of Japan; Smoking Research Foundation; Japan Science and Technology Agency, Core Research for Evolutional Science Technology","This work was supported in part by grants-in-aid from the Ministry of Education, Science, and Culture of Japan, by a grant from the Smoking Research Foundation to H.

Tumour vaccination aims at stimulating a systemic immune response targeted to, mostly weak, antigens expressed in the disseminated tumour lesions. Main challenges in developing effective vaccination protocols are the identification of potent and broadly expressed TRAs(1-3) and effective adjuvants to stimulate a robust and durable immune response(4-6). Here we describe an alternative approach in which the expression of new, and thereby potent, antigens are induced in tumour cells by inhibiting nonsense-mediated messenger RNA decay (NMD)(7-10). Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated inhibition of NMD in tumour cells led to the expression of new antigenic determinants and their immune-mediated rejection. In subcutaneous and metastatic tumour models, tumour-targeted delivery of NMD factor-specific siRNAs conjugated to oligonucleotide aptamer ligands led to significant inhibition of tumour growth that was superior to that of vaccination with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-expressing irradiated tumour cells(11), and could be further enhanced by co-stimulation. Tumour-targeted NMD inhibition forms the basis of a simple, broadly useful, and clinically feasible approach to enhance the antigenicity of disseminated tumours leading to their immune recognition and rejection. The cell-free chemically synthesized oligonucleotide backbone of aptamer-siRNAs reduces the risk of immunogenicity and enhances the feasibility of generating reagents suitable for clinical use.","[Pastor, Fernando; Kolonias, Despina; Gilboa, Eli] Univ Miami, Miller Sch Med Miami, Dodson Interdisciplinary Immunotherapy Inst, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Miami, FL 33134 USA; [Giangrande, Paloma H.] Univ Iowa, Dept Internal Med, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Giangrande, Paloma H.] Univ Iowa, Dept Radiat Oncol, Mol & Cellular Biol Program, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA","Gilboa, E (reprint author), Univ Miami, Miller Sch Med Miami, Dodson Interdisciplinary Immunotherapy Inst, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Miami, FL 33134 USA.",egilboa@med.miami.edu,,"Pastor, Fernando/0000-0003-0432-3133","Dodson foundation; Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center (Medical School, University of Miami)","We thank J.

They are expressed in almost all neurons of the brain, where they regulate synaptic transmission and signal propagation by controlling the activity of voltage-gated calcium (Ca-v) and inward-rectifier potassium (K-ir) channels(1). Molecular cloning revealed that functional GABA(B) receptors are formed by the heteromeric assembly of GABA(B1) with GABA(B2) subunits(2-5). However, cloned GABA(B(1,2)) receptors failed to reproduce the functional diversity observed with native GABA(B) receptors(6-8). Here we show by functional proteomics that GABA(B) receptors in the brain are high-molecular-mass complexes of GABA(B1), GABA(B2) and members of a subfamily of the KCTD (potassium channel tetramerization domain-containing) proteins. KCTD proteins 8, 12, 12b and 16 show distinct expression profiles in the brain and associate tightly with the carboxy terminus of GABA(B2) as tetramers. This co-assembly changes the properties of the GABA(B(1,2)) core receptor: the KCTD proteins increase agonist potency and markedly alter the G-protein signalling of the receptors by accelerating onset and promoting desensitization in a KCTD-subtype-specific manner. Taken together, our results establish the KCTD proteins as auxiliary subunits of GABA(B) receptors that determine the pharmacology and kinetics of the receptor response.","[Schwenk, Jochen; Zolles, Gerd; Bildl, Wolfgang; Schulte, Uwe; Fakler, Bernd] Univ Freiburg, Inst Physiol 2, D-79108 Freiburg, Germany; [Metz, Michaela; Turecek, Rostislav; Fritzius, Thorsten; Ivankova, Klara; Seddik, Riad; Tiao, Jim Y.; Rajalu, Mathieu; Gassmann, Martin; Bettler, Bernhard] Univ Basel, Inst Physiol, Pharmazentrum, Dept Biomed, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; [Rohde, Volker; Schulte, Uwe] Logopharm GmbH, D-79108 Freiburg, Germany; [Tarusawa, Etsuko; Kulik, Akos; Unger, Andreas] Univ Freiburg, Inst Anat & Cell Biol, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Fakler, Bernd] Ctr Biol Signaling Studies Bioss, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Turecek, Rostislav; Trojanova, Johana] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Inst Expt Med, Prague 14220 4, Czech Republic","Fakler, B (reprint author), Univ Freiburg, Inst Physiol 2, Engesserstr 4, D-79108 Freiburg, Germany.",bernd.fakler@physiologie.uni-freiburg.de; bernhard.bettler@unibas.ch,"Turecek, Rostislav/H-2706-2014","Schwenk, Jochen/0000-0003-3664-9795; Gassmann, Martin/0000-0001-6201-3032","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB 746/TP16, SFB 780/A3, EXC294, SFB 780/A2]; Wellcome Trust (ISRF); EU Synapse; GACR [309/06/1304]; Swiss Science Foundation [3100A0-117816]; Fridericus Stiftung; European Community [FP7/2007-2013, 201714]","We thank J.

Spidroins are stored as a highly concentrated fluid dope. On silk formation, intermolecular interactions between repeat regions are established that provide strength and elasticity(3,4). How spiders manage to avoid premature spidroin aggregation before self-assembly is not yet established. A pH drop to 6.3 along the spider's spinning apparatus, altered salt composition and shear forces are believed to trigger the conversion to solid silk, but no molecular details are known. Miniature spidroins consisting of a few repetitive spidroin segments capped by the carboxy-terminal domain form metre-long silk-like fibres irrespective of pH(5). We discovered that incorporation of the amino-terminal domain of major ampullate spidroin 1 from the dragline of the nursery web spider Euprosthenops australis (NT) into mini-spidroins enables immediate, charge-dependent self-assembly at pH values around 6.3, but delays aggregation above pH7. The X-ray structure of NT, determined to 1.7 angstrom resolution, shows a homodimer of dipolar, antiparallel five-helix bundle subunits that lack homologues. The overall dimeric structure and observed charge distribution of NT is expected to be conserved through spider evolution and in all types of spidroins. Our results indicate a relay-like mechanism through which the N-terminal domain regulates spidroin assembly by inhibiting precocious aggregation during storage, and accelerating and directing self-assembly as the pH is lowered along the spider's silk extrusion duct.","[Askarieh, Glareh; Knight, Stefan D.] SLU, Biomed Ctr, Uppsala BioCtr, Dept Mol Biol, SE-75124 Uppsala, Sweden; [Askarieh, Glareh] Univ Oslo, Dept Chem, N-0315 Oslo, Norway; [Hedhammar, My; Nordling, Kerstin; Rising, Anna; Johansson, Jan] SLU, Biomed Ctr, Dept Anat Physiol & Biochem, SE-75123 Uppsala, Sweden; [Saenz, Alejandra; Casals, Cristina] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol 1, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Saenz, Alejandra; Casals, Cristina] Univ Complutense Madrid, CIBER Enfermedades Resp, E-28040 Madrid, Spain","Knight, SD (reprint author), SLU, Biomed Ctr, Uppsala BioCtr, Dept Mol Biol, SE-75124 Uppsala, Sweden.",jan.johansson@afb.slu.se; stefan.knight@molbio.slu.se,"Knight, Stefan/D-4315-2015; Saenz, Alejandra/G-7275-2015; Casals, Cristina/H-4658-2015","Saenz, Alejandra/0000-0001-8439-2985; Casals, Cristina/0000-0003-2696-0918; Knight, Stefan/0000-0002-7180-8758; Rising, Anna/0000-0002-1872-1207",Swedish Research Council; FORMAS,"This work was supported by grants (to J.J., M.

Hence, it is surprising that spider silk proteins can be stored in a soluble form at high concentrations and transformed into extremely stable fibres on demand(2,3). Silk proteins are reminiscent of amphiphilic block copolymers containing stretches of polyalanine and glycine-rich polar elements forming a repetitive core flanked by highly conserved non-repetitive amino-terminal(4,5) and carboxy-terminal(6) domains. The N-terminal domain comprises a secretion signal, but further functions remain unassigned. The C-terminal domain was implicated in the control of solubility and fibre formation(7) initiated by changes in ionic composition(8,9) and mechanical stimuli known to align the repetitive sequence elements and promote beta-sheet formation(10-14). However, despite recent structural data(15), little is known about this remarkable behaviour in molecular detail. Here we present the solution structure of the C-terminal domain of a spider dragline silk protein and provide evidence that the structural state of this domain is essential for controlled switching between the storage and assembly forms of silk proteins. In addition, the C-terminal domain also has a role in the alignment of secondary structural features formed by the repetitive elements in the backbone of spider silk proteins, which is known to be important for the mechanical properties of the fibre.","[Hagn, Franz; Kessler, Horst] Tech Univ Munich, Ctr Integrated Prot Sci CIPSM, D-85747 Garching, Germany; [Hagn, Franz; Kessler, Horst] Tech Univ Munich, Inst Adv Study, D-85747 Garching, Germany; [Eisoldt, Lukas; Hardy, John G.; Vendrely, Charlotte; Scheibel, Thomas] Univ Bayreuth, Fak Angew Nat Wissensch, Lehrstuhl Biomat, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany; [Coles, Murray] Max Planck Inst Dev Biol, Dept Prot Evolut, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany","Kessler, H (reprint author), Tech Univ Munich, Ctr Integrated Prot Sci CIPSM, D-85747 Garching, Germany.",thomas.scheibel@uni-bayreuth.de; horst.kessler@ch.tum.de,"Hardy, John/D-1501-2009; Scheibel, Thomas/I-1170-2014; Hagn, Technical University/N-9553-2016","Hardy, John/0000-0003-0655-2167; Scheibel, Thomas/0000-0002-0457-2423; Hagn, Technical University/0000-0002-1315-459X","Center for Integrated Protein Science Munich (CIPS<SUP>M</SUP>); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SCHE 603/4-3]; Elitenetzwerk Bayern, CompInt; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation","This paper is in memoriam of R.

In Drosophila, genetic studies identified more than 15 different PcG proteins that are required to repress homeotic (HOX) and other developmental regulator genes in cells where they must stay inactive(1,7,8). Biochemical analyses established that these PcG proteins exist in distinct multiprotein complexes that bind to and modify chromatin of target genes(1-4). Among those, Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) and the related dRing-associated factors (dRAF) complex contain an E3 ligase activity for monoubiquitination of histone H2A (refs 1-4). Here we show that the uncharacterized Drosophila PcG gene calypso encodes the ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase BAP1. Biochemically purified Calypso exists in a complex with the PcG protein ASX, and this complex, named Polycomb repressive deubiquitinase (PR-DUB), is bound at PcG target genes in Drosophila. Reconstituted recombinant Drosophila and human PR-DUB complexes remove monoubiquitin from H2A but not from H2B in nucleosomes. Drosophila mutants lacking PR-DUB show a strong increase in the levels of monoubiquitinated H2A. A mutation that disrupts the catalytic activity of Calypso, or absence of the ASX subunit abolishes H2A deubiquitination in vitro and HOX gene repression in vivo. Polycomb gene silencing may thus entail adynamic balance between H2A ubiquitination by PRC1 and dRAF, and H2A deubiquitination by PR-DUB.","[Scheuermann, Johanna C.; Alonso, Andres Gaytan de Ayala; Oktaba, Katarzyna; Ly-Hartig, Nga; Fraterman, Sven; Wilm, Matthias; Mueller, Juerg] European Mol Biol Lab, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [McGinty, Robert K.; Muir, Tom W.] Rockefeller Univ, New York, NY 10065 USA","Muller, J (reprint author), European Mol Biol Lab, Meyerhofstr 1, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany.",juerg.mueller@embl.de,,,NIH [RC2CA148354]; EMBL; DFG,"We thank T.

Hydrogen metabolism is facilitated by the activity of three evolutionarily and structurally unrelated enzymes: the [NiFe]-hydrogenases, [FeFe]-hydrogenases and [Fe]-hydrogenases(3,4) (Hmd). The catalytic core of the [FeFe]-hydrogenase (HydA), termed the H-cluster, exists as a [4Fe-4S] subcluster linked by a cysteine thiolate to a modified 2Fe subcluster with unique non-protein ligands(5,6). The 2Fe subcluster and non-protein ligands are synthesized by the hydrogenase maturation enzymes HydE, HydF and HydG; however, the mechanism, synthesis and means of insertion of H-cluster components remain unclear(7-10). Here we show the structure of HydA(Delta EFG) (HydA expressed in a genetic background devoid of the active site H-cluster biosynthetic genes hydE, hydF and hydG) revealing the presence of a [4Fe-4S] cluster and an open pocket for the 2Fe subcluster. The structure indicates that H-cluster synthesis occurs in a stepwise manner, first with synthesis and insertion of the [4Fe-4S] subcluster by generalized host-cell machinery(11,12) and then with synthesis and insertion of the 2Fe subcluster by specialized hydE-, hydF- and hydG-encoded maturation machinery(7-10). Insertion of the 2Fe subcluster presumably occurs through a cationically charged channel that collapses following incorporation, as a result of conformational changes in two conserved loop regions. The structure, together with phylogenetic analysis, indicates that HydA emerged within bacteria most likely from a Nar1-like ancestor lacking the 2Fe subcluster, and that this was followed by acquisition in several unicellular eukaryotes.","[Mulder, David W.; Boyd, Eric S.; Sarma, Ranjana; Lange, Rachel K.; Endrizzi, James A.; Broderick, Joan B.; Peters, John W.] Montana State Univ, Astrobiol Biogeocatalysis Res Ctr, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Mulder, David W.; Boyd, Eric S.; Sarma, Ranjana; Lange, Rachel K.; Endrizzi, James A.; Broderick, Joan B.; Peters, John W.] Montana State Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA","Peters, JW (reprint author), Montana State Univ, Astrobiol Biogeocatalysis Res Ctr, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.",john.peters@chemistry.montana.edu,,"Peters, John/0000-0001-9117-9568","US Air Force Office of Scientific Research Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative [FA9550-05-01-0365]; NASA Astrobiology Institute (NAI) [NNA08C-N85A]; NAI; US Department of Energy, Office of Biological and Environmental Research; US National Institutes of Health, National Center for Research Resources; US National Institute of General Medical Sciences","This work was supported by a US Air Force Office of Scientific Research Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative Award (FA9550-05-01-0365, J.W.P.) and the NASA Astrobiology Institute (NAI)-funded Astrobiology Biogeocatalysis Research Center (NNA08C-N85A, J.B.B. and J.W.P.).

Pattern classification may be achieved by abrupt switching between discrete activity states of neuronal circuits, but few experimental studies have directly tested this. We gradually varied the concentration or molecular identity of odours and optically measured responses across output neurons of the olfactory bulb in zebrafish. Whereas population activity patterns were largely insensitive to changes in odour concentration, morphing of one odour into another resulted in abrupt transitions between odour representations. These transitions were mediated by coordinated response changes among small neuronal ensembles rather than by shifts in the global network state. The olfactory bulb therefore classifies odour-evoked input patterns into many discrete and defined output patterns, as proposed by attractor models. This computation is consistent with perceptual phenomena and may represent a general information processing strategy in the brain.","[Niessing, Joern; Friedrich, Rainer W.] Friedrich Miescher Inst Biomed Res, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland","Friedrich, RW (reprint author), Friedrich Miescher Inst Biomed Res, Maulbeerstr 66, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland.",Rainer.Friedrich@fmi.ch,,,Novartis Research Foundation; Max Planck Society; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [FOR 643]; Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes,"We thank A.

The code determines new classes of splicing patterns, identifies distinct regulatory programs in different tissues, and identifies mutation-verified regulatory sequences. Widespread regulatory strategies are revealed, including the use of unexpectedly large combinations of features, the establishment of low exon inclusion levels that are overcome by features in specific tissues, the appearance of features deeper into introns than previously appreciated, and the modulation of splice variant levels by transcript structure characteristics. The code detected a class of exons whose inclusion silences expression in adult tissues by activating nonsense-mediated messenger RNA decay, but whose exclusion promotes expression during embryogenesis.

It has been shown that in these objects the rotational spectral lines of molecular hydrogen observed at mid-infrared wavelengths are not affected by dust obscuration(3), but left unresolved was the source of excitation for this emission. Here I report an analysis of archival Spitzer Space Telescope data on ultraluminous infrared galaxies and demonstrate that dust obscuration affects star formation indicators but not molecular hydrogen. I thereby establish that the emission of H-2 is not co-spatial with the buried starburst activity and originates outside the obscured regions. This is unexpected in light of the standard view that H-2 emission is directly associated with star-formation activity(3-5). I propose the alternative view that H-2 emission in these objects traces shocks in the surrounding material that are excited by interactions with nearby galaxies. Large-scale shocks cooling by means of H-2 emission may accordingly be more common than previously thought. In the early Universe, a boost in H-2 emission by this process may have accelerated the cooling of matter as it collapsed to form the first stars and galaxies, and would make these first structures more readily observable(6).","Inst Adv Study, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA","Zakamska, NL (reprint author), Inst Adv Study, Einstein Dr, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.",zakamska@ias.edu,,,NASA; John N.

Depending on the gain applied to the quadratures of a single spatial and temporal mode of the electromagnetic field, linear amplifiers can be classified into two categories ( phase sensitive and phase preserving) with fundamentally different noise properties(2). Phase-sensitive amplifiers use squeezing to reduce the quantum noise, but are useful only in cases in which a reference phase is attached to the signal, such as in homodyne detection. A phase-preserving amplifier would be preferable in many applications, but such devices have not been available until now. Here we experimentally realize a proposal(3) for an intrinsically phase-preserving, superconducting parametric amplifier of non-degenerate type. It is based on a Josephson ring modulator, which consists of four Josephson junctions in a Wheatstone bridge configuration. The device symmetry greatly enhances the purity of the amplification process and simplifies both its operation and its analysis. The measured characteristics of the amplifier in terms of gain and bandwidth are in good agreement with analytical predictions. Using a newly developed noise source, we show that the upper bound on the total system noise of our device under real operating conditions is three times the quantum limit. We foresee applications in the area of quantum analog signal processing, such as quantum non-demolition single-shot readout of qubits(4), quantum feedback(5) and the production of entangled microwave signal pairs(6).","[Bergeal, N.; Schackert, F.; Metcalfe, M.; Vijay, R.; Manucharyan, V.

These mechanical elements have distinct mechanical properties, and when combined, they provide the desired passive elastic properties of muscle(6-11), which are a unique combination of strength, extensibility and resilience. Single-molecule atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies demonstrated that the macroscopic behaviour of titin in intact myofibrils can be reconstituted by combining the mechanical properties of these mechanical elements measured at the single-molecule level(8). Here we report artificial elastomeric proteins that mimic the molecular architecture of titin through the combination of well-characterized protein domains GB1(12) and resilin(13). We show that these artificial elastomeric proteins can be photochemically crosslinked and cast into solid biomaterials. These biomaterials behave as rubber-like materials showing high resilience at low strain and as shock-absorber-like materials at high strain by effectively dissipating energy. These properties are comparable to the passive elastic properties of muscles within the physiological range of sarcomere length(14) and so these materials represent a new muscle-mimetic biomaterial. The mechanical properties of these biomaterials can be fine-tuned by adjusting the composition of the elastomeric proteins, providing the opportunity to develop biomaterials that are mimetic of different types of muscles. We anticipate that these biomaterials will find applications in tissue engineering(15) as scaffold and matrix for artificial muscles.","[Lv, Shanshan; Cao, Yi; Balamurali, M.

The root-mean-squared (r.m.s.) intensity for the resolved part of the radial magnetic field at the core-mantle boundary is 0.3 mT, but further assumptions are needed to infer the strength of the field inside the core. Recent diagnostics obtained from numerical geodynamo models(1) indicate that the magnitude of the dipole field at the surface of a fluid dynamo is about ten times weaker than the r.m.s. field strength in its interior, which would yield an intensity of the order of several millitesla within the Earth's core. However, a 60-year signal found in the variation in the length of day(2) has long been associated with magneto-hydrodynamic torsional waves carried by a much weaker internal field(3,4). According to these studies, the r.m.s. strength of the field in the cylindrical radial direction (calculated for all length scales) is only 0.2 mT, a figure even smaller than the r.m.s. strength of the large-scale (spherical harmonic degree n <= 13) field visible at the core-mantle boundary. Here we reconcile numerical geodynamo models with studies of geostrophic motions in the Earth's core that rely on geomagnetic data. From an ensemble inversion of core flow models, we find a torsional wave recurring every six years, the angular momentum of which accounts well for both the phase and the amplitude of the six-year signal for change in length of day detected over the second half of the twentieth century(5). It takes about four years for the wave to propagate throughout the fluid outer core, and this travel time translates into a slowness for Alfven waves that corresponds to a r.m.s. field strength in the cylindrical radial direction of approximately 2 mT. Assuming isotropy, this yields a r.m.s. field strength of 4 mT inside the Earth's core.","[Gillet, Nicolas; Jault, Dominique; Canet, Elisabeth] Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, Lab Geophys Interne & Tectonophys, F-38041 Grenoble 9, France; [Fournier, Alexandre] Univ Paris Diderot, CNRS, Inst Phys Globe Paris, Equipe Geomagnetisme, F-75252 Paris 5, France","Gillet, N (reprint author), Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, Lab Geophys Interne & Tectonophys, BP 53, F-38041 Grenoble 9, France.",nicolas.gillet@obs.ujf-grenoble.fr,"Fournier, Alexandre/A-5774-2011; Jault, Dominique/B-8820-2017","Fournier, Alexandre/0000-0003-3276-0496; Jault, Dominique/0000-0001-5592-5746",French Agence Nationale de la Recherche [BLAN06-2.155316]; French Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales,"We thank M.

Although slip is almost purely aseismic at depths greater than about 40 km, heterogeneous surface strain(1-8) suggests that both modes of slip occur at shallower depths, with aseismic slip resulting from steady or transient creep in the interseismic and postseismic periods(9-11). Thus, active faults seem to comprise areas that slip mostly during earthquakes, and areas that mostly slip aseismically. The size, location and frequency of earthquakes that a megathrust can generate thus depend on where and when aseismic creep is taking place, and what fraction of the long-term slip rate it accounts for. Here we address this issue by focusing on the central Peru megathrust. We show that the Pisco earthquake, with moment magnitude M-w = 8.0, ruptured two asperities within a patch that had remained locked in the interseismic period, and triggered aseismic frictional afterslip on two adjacent patches. The most prominent patch of afterslip coincides with the subducting Nazca ridge, an area also characterized by low interseismic coupling, which seems to have repeatedly acted as a barrier to seismic rupture propagation in the past. The seismogenic portion of the megathrust thus appears to be composed of interfingering rate-weakening and rate-strengthening patches. The rate-strengthening patches contribute to a high proportion of aseismic slip, and determine the extent and frequency of large interplate earthquakes. Aseismic slip accounts for as much as 50-70% of the slip budget on the seismogenic portion of the megathrust in central Peru, and the return period of earthquakes with M-w = 8.0 in the Pisco area is estimated to be 250 years.","[Perfettini, Hugo; Bondoux, Francis; Chlieh, Mohamed; Audin, Laurence; Soler, Pierre] Inst Rech Dev, F-13572 Marseille 02, France; [Perfettini, Hugo; Tavera, Hernando; Bondoux, Francis; Audin, Laurence] Inst Geofis Peru, Lima, Peru; [Avouac, Jean-Philippe; Kositsky, Andrew; Sladen, Anthony] CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, Tecton Observ, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Nocquet, Jean-Mathieu; Chlieh, Mohamed] GeoAzur, F-06560 Valbonne, France; [Farber, Daniel L.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Perfettini, Hugo; Bondoux, Francis] Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, Observ Sci, Lab Geophys Interne & Tectonophys,LCPC,IRD, F-38041 Grenoble 9, France; [Perfettini, Hugo; Audin, Laurence] Univ Toulouse 3, CNRS, Observ Midi Pyrenees, Lab Mecanismes Transfert Geol,IRD, F-31400 Toulouse, France; [Farber, Daniel L.] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Livermore, CA 94550 USA; [Kositsky, Andrew] Ashima Res, Pasadena, CA 91106 USA","Perfettini, H (reprint author), Inst Rech Dev, 44 Blvd Dunkerque, F-13572 Marseille 02, France.",hugo.perfettini@ird.fr,"Farber, Daniel/F-9237-2011; Tavera, Hernando/I-5487-2013; Avouac, Jean-Philippe/B-5699-2015; laurence, audin/D-7727-2013; Sladen, Anthony/A-2532-2017","Avouac, Jean-Philippe/0000-0002-3060-8442; laurence, audin/0000-0002-4510-479X; Sladen, Anthony/0000-0003-4126-0020",Institute de Recherche pour le Developpement; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation; National Science Foundation [EAR-0838495],"We thank J.

Pathogenic mutations in mtDNA are detected in approximately 1 in 250 live births(1-3) and at least 1 in 10,000 adults in the UK are affected by mtDNA disease(4). Treatment options for patients with mtDNA disease are extremely limited and are predominantly supportive in nature. Mitochondrial DNA is transmitted maternally and it has been proposed that nuclear transfer techniques may be an approach for the prevention of transmission of human mtDNA disease(5,6). Here we show that transfer of pronuclei between abnormally fertilized human zygotes results in minimal carry-over of donor zygote mtDNA and is compatible with onward development to the blastocyst stage in vitro. By optimizing the procedure we found the average level of carry-over after transfer of two pronuclei is less than 2.0%, with many of the embryos containing no detectable donor mtDNA. We believe that pronuclear transfer between zygotes, as well as the recently described metaphase II spindle transfer, has the potential to prevent the transmission of mtDNA disease in humans.","[Greggains, Gareth D.; Harbottle, Stephen J.; Murdoch, Alison P.; Herbert, Mary] Newcastle Univ, Int Ctr Life, Newcastle Fertil Ctr, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 4EP, Tyne & Wear, England; [Craven, Lyndsey; Tuppen, Helen A.; Murphy, Julie L.; Cree, Lynsey M.; Chinnery, Patrick F.; Taylor, Robert W.; Lightowlers, Robert N.; Turnbull, Douglass M.] Newcastle Univ, Inst Ageing & Hlth, Mitochondrial Res Grp, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 4HH, Tyne & Wear, England; [Turnbull, Douglass M.] Newcastle Univ, Ctr Brain Ageing & Vital, Inst Ageing & Hlth, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 4HH, Tyne & Wear, England; [Murdoch, Alison P.; Herbert, Mary; Turnbull, Douglass M.] Newcastle Univ, Int Ctr Life, Biosci Ctr, NE England Stem Cell Inst NESCI, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 4EP, Tyne & Wear, England; [Greggains, Gareth D.; Herbert, Mary] Newcastle Univ, Int Ctr Life, Inst Ageing & Hlth, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 4EP, Tyne & Wear, England","Herbert, M (reprint author), Newcastle Univ, Int Ctr Life, Newcastle Fertil Ctr, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 4EP, Tyne & Wear, England.",mary.herbert@ncl.ac.uk; d.m.turnbull@ncl.ac.uk,,"Cree, Lynsey/0000-0003-2090-1589","Muscular Dystrophy Campaign; Wellcome Trust [074454/Z/04/Z]; Medical Research Council [G0601157, G0601943, G0700718]; UK National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre for Ageing and Age-related Disease; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; Economic and Social Research Council","We thank M.

It has a critical role in the formation of 'fine-grained' patterns, generating distinct cell fates among groups of initially equivalent neighbouring cells and sharply delineating neighbouring regions in developing tissues(2-5). The Delta ligand has been shown to have two activities: it transactivates Notch in neighbouring cells and cis-inhibits Notch in its own cell. However, it remains unclear how Notch integrates these two activities and how the resulting system facilitates pattern formation. Here we report the development of a quantitative time-lapse microscopy platform for analysing Notch-Delta signalling dynamics in individual mammalian cells, with the aim of addressing these issues. By controlling both cis- and trans-Delta concentrations, and monitoring the dynamics of a Notch reporter, we measured the combined cis-trans input-output relationship in the Notch-Delta system. The data revealed a striking difference between the responses of Notch to trans-and cis-Delta: whereas the response to trans-Delta is graded, the response to cis-Delta is sharp and occurs at a fixed threshold, independent of trans-Delta. We developed a simple mathematical model that shows how these behaviours emerge from the mutual inactivation of Notch and Delta proteins in the same cell. This interaction generates an ultrasensitive switch between mutually exclusive sending ( high Delta/low Notch) and receiving (high Notch/low Delta) signalling states. At the multicellular level, this switch can amplify small differences between neighbouring cells even without transcription-mediated feedback. This Notch-Delta signalling switch facilitates the formation of sharp boundaries and lateral-inhibition patterns in models of development, and provides insight into previously unexplained mutant behaviours.","[Sprinzak, David; Lakhanpal, Amit; LeBon, Lauren; Santat, Leah A.; Fontes, Michelle E.; Elowitz, Michael B.] CALTECH, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Div Biol, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Sprinzak, David; Lakhanpal, Amit; LeBon, Lauren; Santat, Leah A.; Fontes, Michelle E.; Elowitz, Michael B.] CALTECH, Dept Appl Phys, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Anderson, Graham A.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Chem & Syst Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Garcia-Ojalvo, Jordi] Univ Politecn Cataluna, Dept Fis & Engn Nucl, E-08222 Terrassa, Spain","Elowitz, MB (reprint author), CALTECH, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Div Biol, 1200 E Calif Blvd, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",melowitz@caltech.edu,"Garcia-Ojalvo, Jordi/A-4574-2009","Garcia-Ojalvo, Jordi/0000-0002-3716-7520; Sprinzak, David/0000-0001-6776-6957","US National Institutes of Health [F32GM77014, GM08042]; Caltech Center for Biological Circuit Design; Packard Foundation; Fannie and John Hertz Foundation; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion (Spain) [FIS2009-13360]","We would like to thank I.

Drosophila and other insects have gustatory sensory neurons that mediate the recognition of external water sources(2-4), but little is known about the underlying molecular mechanism for water taste detection. Here we identify a member of the degenerin/epithelial sodium channel family(5), PPK28, as an osmosensitive ion channel that mediates the cellular and behavioural response to water. We use molecular, cellular, calcium imaging and electrophysiological approaches to show that ppk28 is expressed in water-sensing neurons, and that loss of ppk28 abolishes water sensitivity. Moreover, ectopic expression of ppk28 confers water sensitivity to bitter-sensing gustatory neurons in the fly and sensitivity to hypoosmotic solutions when expressed in heterologous cells. These studies link an osmosensitive ion channel to water taste detection and drinking behaviour, providing the framework for examining the molecular basis for water detection in other animals.","[Scott, Kristin] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Helen Wills Neurosci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Ngai, John] Univ Calif Berkeley, Funct Genom Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Scott, Kristin] Univ Calif Berkeley, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Scott, K (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Helen Wills Neurosci Inst, 229 Stanley Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",kscott@berkeley.edu,"Hiroi, Makoto/B-6834-2008","Hiroi, Makoto/0000-0002-0136-5891",NIH (NIDCD); Burroughs-Wellcome CAREER Award; John Merck Award; NIH,"We thank K.

Current therapy relies upon a combination of pegylated interferon-alpha and ribavirin, a poorly tolerated regimen typically associated with less than 50% sustained virological response rate in those infected with genotype 1 virus(2,3). The development of direct-acting antiviral agents to treat HCV has focused predominantly on inhibitors of the viral enzymes NS3 protease and the RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase NS5B(4). Here we describe the profile of BMS-790052, a small molecule inhibitor of the HCV NS5A protein that exhibits picomolar half-maximum effective concentrations (EC(50)) towards replicons expressing a broad range of HCV genotypes and the JFH-1 genotype 2a infectious virus in cell culture. In a phase I clinical trial in patients chronically infected with HCV, administration of a single 100-mg dose of BMS-790052 was associated with a 3.3 log(10) reduction in mean viral load measured 24 h post-dose that was sustained for an additional 120 h in two patients infected with genotype 1b virus. Genotypic analysis of samples taken at baseline, 24 and 144 h post-dose revealed that the major HCV variants observed had substitutions at amino-acid positions identified using the in vitro replicon system. These results provide the first clinical validation of an inhibitor of HCV NS5A, a protein with no known enzymatic function, as an approach to the suppression of virus replication that offers potential as part of a therapeutic regimen based on combinations of HCV inhibitors.","[Belema, Makonen; Snyder, Lawrence B.; Nguyen, Van N.; Serrano-Wu, Michael H.; Meanwell, Nicholas A.; Hamann, Lawrence G.] Bristol Myers Squibb Co, Res & Dev, Dept Discovery Chem, Wallingford, CT 06492 USA; [Nettles, Richard E.; Chien, Caly; Grasela, Dennis M.] Bristol Myers Squibb Co, Res & Dev, Dept Discovery Med & Clin Pharmacol, Princeton, NJ 08543 USA; [Langley, David R.] Bristol Myers Squibb Co, Res & Dev, Dept Comp Aided Drug Design, Wallingford, CT 06492 USA; [Knipe, Jay O.] Bristol Myers Squibb Co, Res & Dev, Dept Metab & Pharmacokinet, Wallingford, CT 06492 USA; [Gao, Min; Fridell, Robert A.; Sun, Jin-Hua; O'Boyle, Donald R.; Lemm, Julie A.; Wang, Chunfu; Colonno, Richard J.] Bristol Myers Squibb Co, Res & Dev, Dept Virol, Wallingford, CT 06492 USA","Meanwell, NA (reprint author), Bristol Myers Squibb Co, Res & Dev, Dept Discovery Chem, 5 Res Pkwy, Wallingford, CT 06492 USA.",Nicholas.Meanwell@bms.com,,"Sun, Jin-hua/0000-0003-2813-3633",,,,23,587,605,5,48,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-May,2010,465,7294,,,,,96,U108,,10.1038/nature08960,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,591OW,WOS:000277311900038,20410884.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,lawrence g.,hamann,na,na,na,na,na

The haploid yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae selects mating partners by interpreting the concentration gradient of pheromone secreted by potential mates through a network of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling proteins(2,3). The mating decision in yeast is an all-or-none, or switch-like, response that allows cells to filter weak pheromone signals, thus avoiding inappropriate commitment to mating by responding only at or above critical concentrations when a mate is sufficiently close(4). The molecular mechanisms that govern the switch-like mating decision are poorly understood. Here we show that the switching mechanism arises from competition between the MAPK Fus3 and a phosphatase Ptc1 for control of the phosphorylation state of four sites on the scaffold protein Ste5. This competition results in a switch-like dissociation of Fus3 from Ste5 that is necessary to generate the switch-like mating response. Thus, the decision to mate is made at an early stage in the pheromone pathway and occurs rapidly, perhaps to prevent the loss of the potential mate to competitors. We argue that the architecture of the Fus3Ste5- Ptc1 circuit generates a novel ultrasensitivity mechanism, which is robust to variations in the concentrations of these proteins. This robustness helps assure that mating can occur despite stochastic or genetic variation between individuals. The role of Ste5 as a direct modulator of a cell-fate decision expands the functional repertoire of scaffold proteins beyond providing specificity and efficiency of information processing(5,6). Similar mechanisms may govern cellular decisions in higher organisms and be disrupted in cancer.","[Malleshaiah, Mohan K.; Michnick, Stephen W.] Univ Montreal, Dept Biochim, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Michnick, Stephen W.] Univ Montreal, Ctr Robert Cedergren Bioinformat & Genom, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Shahrezaei, Vahid] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Math, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Swain, Peter S.] McGill Univ, Dept Physiol, Montreal, PQ H3G 1Y6, Canada; [Swain, Peter S.] Univ Edinburgh, Ctr Syst Biol, Edinburgh EH9 3JD, Midlothian, Scotland","Michnick, SW (reprint author), Univ Montreal, Dept Biochim, CP 6128,Succursale Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada.",peter.swain@ed.ac.uk; stephen.michnick@umontreal.ca,,"Swain, Peter/0000-0001-7489-8587",Canadian Institutes of Health Research [MOP-GMX-152556]; Canada Research Chair in Integrative Genomics; Canada Research Chair in Systems Biology,"We thank J.

In plants, 24-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) bound to the effector protein, Argonaute 4 (AGO4), can direct de novo DNA methylation by the methyltransferase DRM2 (refs 2, 4-6). Here we report a new regulator of RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) in Arabidopsis: RDM1. Loss-of-function mutations in the RDM1 gene impair the accumulation of 24-nucleotide siRNAs, reduce DNA methylation, and release transcriptional gene silencing at RdDM target loci. RDM1 encodes a small protein that seems to bind single-stranded methyl DNA, and associates and co-localizes with RNA polymerase II (Pol II, also known as NRPB), AGO4 and DRM2 in the nucleus. Our results indicate that RDM1 is a component of the RdDM effector complex and may have a role in linking siRNA production with pre-existing or de novo cytosine methylation. Our results also indicate that, although RDM1 and Pol V (also known as NRPE) may function together at some RdDM target sites in the peri-nucleolar siRNA processing centre, Pol II rather than Pol Vis associated with the RdDM effector complex at target sites in the nucleoplasm.","[Gao, Zhihuan; Liu, Hai-Liang; He, Xinjian; Qian, Weiqiang; Lin, Huixin; Xie, Mingtang; Zhang, Shoudong; Miki, Daisuke; Zhan, Xiangqiang; Jin, Hailing; Zhu, Jian-Kang] Univ Calif Riverside, Inst Integrat Genome Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Gao, Zhihuan; Liu, Hai-Liang; He, Xinjian; Qian, Weiqiang; Lin, Huixin; Xie, Mingtang; Zhang, Shoudong; Miki, Daisuke; Zhan, Xiangqiang; Zhu, Jian-Kang] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Liu, Hai-Liang] Tongji Univ, Sch Life Sci & Technol, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; [Daxinger, Lucia; Matzke, Antonius J.

The first involves the activity of the light-dependent Pchlide oxidoreductase(5-9), and the second involves the light-independent (dark-operative) Pchlide oxidoreductase(10) (DPOR). DPOR is a nitrogenase-like enzyme consisting of two components, L-protein (a BchL dimer) and NB-protein (a BchN-BchB heterotetramer), which are structurally related to nitrogenase Fe protein and MoFe protein, respectively(10,11). Here we report the crystal structure of the NB-protein of DPOR from Rhodobacter capsulatus at a resolution of 2.3 angstrom. As expected, the overall structure is similar to that of nitrogenase MoFe protein: each catalytic BchN-BchB unit contains one Pchlide and one iron-sulphur cluster (NB-cluster) coordinated uniquely by one aspartate and three cysteines. Unique aspartate ligation is not necessarily needed for the cluster assembly but is essential for the catalytic activity. Specific Pchlide-binding accompanies the partial unwinding of an a-helix that belongs to the next catalytic BchN-BchB unit. We propose a unique trans-specific reduction mechanism in which the distorted C17-propionate of Pchlide and an aspartate from BchB serve as proton donors for C18 and C17 of Pchlide, respectively. Intriguingly, the spatial arrangement of the NB-cluster and Pchlide is almost identical to that of the P-cluster and FeMo-cofactor in nitrogenase MoFe-protein, illustrating that a common architecture exists to reduce chemically stable multibonds of porphyrin and dinitrogen.","[Muraki, Norifumi; Kurisu, Genji] Osaka Univ, Inst Prot Res, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Muraki, Norifumi; Shiba, Tomoo] Univ Tokyo, Dept Life Sci, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1538902, Japan; [Nomata, Jiro; Ebata, Kozue; Fujita, Yuichi] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Bioagr Sci, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Mizoguchi, Tadashi; Tamiaki, Hitoshi] Ritsumeikan Univ, Dept Biosci & Biotechnol, Shiga 5258577, Japan; [Fujita, Yuichi] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan","Kurisu, G (reprint author), Osaka Univ, Inst Prot Res, 2-2 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan.",gkurisu@protein.osaka-u.ac.jp; fujita@agr.nagoya-u.ac.jp,"Nomata, Jiro/D-1813-2015","Nomata, Jiro/0000-0001-9849-2426; KURISU, GENJI/0000-0002-5354-0807","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) [17687008, 18054308, 19570036, 20200063, 19750148, 19350088, 19010733, 2110614]; Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST); Kato Memorial Science Foundation; Toyoaki Scholarship Foundation; Japan Securities Scholarship Foundation","We thank K.

Current processes to activate the strong C-H bond (104 kcal mol(-1)) in methane require high temperatures, are costly and inefficient, and produce waste(2). In nature, methanotrophic bacteria perform this reaction under ambient conditions using metalloenzymes called methane mono-oxygenases (MMOs). MMOs thus provide the optimal model for an efficient, environmentally sound catalyst(3). There are two types of MMO. Soluble MMO (sMMO) is expressed by several strains of methanotroph under copper-limited conditions and oxidizes methane with a well-characterized catalytic di-iron centre(4). Particulate MMO ( pMMO) is an integral membrane metalloenzyme produced by all methanotrophs and is composed of three subunits, pmoA, pmoB and pmoC, arranged in a trimeric alpha(3)beta(3)gamma(3) complex(5). Despite 20 years of research and the availability of two crystal structures, the metal composition and location of the pMMO metal active site are not known. Here we show that pMMO activity is dependent on copper, not iron, and that the copper active site is located in the soluble domains of the pmoB subunit rather than within the membrane. Recombinant soluble fragments of pmoB (spmoB) bind copper and have propylene and methane oxidation activities. Disruption of each copper centre in spmoB by mutagenesis indicates that the active site is a dicopper centre. These findings help resolve the pMMO controversy and provide a promising new approach to developing environmentally friendly C-H oxidation catalysts.","[Rawat, Swati; Stemmler, Timothy L.] Wayne State Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Detroit, MI 48201 USA; [Balasubramanian, Ramakrishnan; Smith, Stephen M.; Yatsunyk, Liliya A.; Rosenzweig, Amy C.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Biochem Mol Biol & Cell Biol, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Balasubramanian, Ramakrishnan; Smith, Stephen M.; Yatsunyk, Liliya A.; Rosenzweig, Amy C.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Chem, Evanston, IL 60208 USA","Stemmler, TL (reprint author), Wayne State Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Detroit, MI 48201 USA.",tstemmle@med.wayne.edu; amyr@northwestern.edu,"Balasubramanian, Ramakrishnan/C-7620-2011","rawat, swati/0000-0003-3905-0446","US National Institutes of Health (NIH) [GM070473, DK068139]; Department of Energy, Office of Biological and Environmental Research","This work was supported by US National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants GM070473 (A.

Quantum gases provide the opportunity to establish a direct link between experiments and generic models that capture the underlying physics. The Dicke model describes a collective matter-light interaction and has been predicted to show an intriguing quantum phase transition. Here we realize the Dicke quantum phase transition in an open system formed by a Bose-Einstein condensate coupled to an optical cavity, and observe the emergence of a self-organized supersolid phase. The phase transition is driven by infinitely long-range interactions between the condensed atoms, induced by two-photon processes involving the cavity mode and a pump field. We show that the phase transition is described by the Dicke Hamiltonian, including counter-rotating coupling terms, and that the supersolid phase is associated with a spontaneously broken spatial symmetry.

For example, in the visual cortex, many neurons fire predominantly in response to moving objects of a preferred orientation. However, the characteristics of the synaptic input that cortical neurons receive to generate their output firing pattern remain unclear. Here we report a novel approach for the visualization and functional mapping of sensory inputs to the dendrites of cortical neurons in vivo. By combining high-speed two-photon imaging with electrophysiological recordings, we identify local subthreshold calcium signals that correspond to orientation-specific synaptic inputs. We find that even inputs that share the same orientation preference are widely distributed throughout the dendritic tree. At the same time, inputs of different orientation preference are interspersed, so that adjacent dendritic segments are tuned to distinct orientations. Thus, orientation-tuned neurons can compute their characteristic firing pattern by integrating spatially distributed synaptic inputs coding for multiple stimulus orientations.","[Konnerth, Arthur] Tech Univ Munich, Inst Neurosci, D-80802 Munich, Germany; Tech Univ Munich, Ctr Integrated Prot Sci, D-80802 Munich, Germany","Konnerth, A (reprint author), Tech Univ Munich, Inst Neurosci, Biedersteinerstr 29, D-80802 Munich, Germany.",arthur.konnerth@lrz.tum.de,"Jia, Hongbo/H-2476-2017","Jia, Hongbo/0000-0003-1585-2161",DFG [IRTG 1373]; Friedrich Schiedel Foundation,"We are grateful to B.

Its receptors possess a seven-transmembrane topology with the amino terminus located intracellularly, which is the opposite of G-protein-coupled receptors. Here we provide evidence that adiponectin induces extracellular Ca2+ influx by adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1), which was necessary for subsequent activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase beta (CaMKK beta), AMPK and SIRT1, increased expression and decreased acetylation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha), and increased mitochondria in myocytes. Moreover, muscle-specific disruption of AdipoR1 suppressed the adiponectin-mediated increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration, and decreased the activation of CaMKK, AMPK and SIRT1 by adiponectin. Suppression of AdipoR1 also resulted in decreased PGC-1 alpha expression and deacetylation, decreased mitochondrial content and enzymes, decreased oxidative type I myofibres, and decreased oxidative stress-detoxifying enzymes in skeletal muscle, which were associated with insulin resistance and decreased exercise endurance.

So far, no measurements of water ice on asteroids(4,5) have been made, but its presence has been inferred from the comet-like activity of several small asteroids, including two members of the Themis dynamical family(6). Here we report infrared spectra of the asteroid 24 Themis which show that ice and organic compounds are not only present on its surface but also prevalent. Infrared spectral differences between it and other asteroids make 24 Themis unique so far, and our identification of ice and organics agrees with independent results(7) that rule out other compounds as possible sources of the observed spectral structure. The widespread presence of surface ice on 24 Themis is somewhat unexpected because of the relatively short lifetime of exposed ice at this distance (similar to 3.2 AU) from the Sun.

Here we report the spectroscopic detection of water ice and organic material on the asteroid 24 Themis, a detection that has been independently confirmed(2). 24 Themis belongs to the same dynamical family as three of the five known MBCs, and the presence of ice on 24 Themis is strong evidence that it also is present in the MBCs.

This is in stark contrast to the much studied dilute gases of ultracold atoms, which have isotropic and extremely short-range (or 'contact') interactions. Furthermore, the large electric dipole moment of polar molecules can be tuned using an external electric field; this has a range of applications such as the control of ultracold chemical reactions(1), the design of a platform for quantum information processing(2-4) and the realization of novel quantum many-body systems(5-8). Despite intense experimental efforts aimed at observing the influence of dipoles on ultracold molecules(9), only recently have sufficiently high densities been achieved(10). Here we report the experimental observation of dipolar collisions in an ultracold molecular gas prepared close to quantum degeneracy. For modest values of an applied electric field, we observe a pronounced increase in the loss rate of fermionic potassium-rubidium molecules due to ultracold chemical reactions. We find that the loss rate has a steep power-law dependence on the induced electric dipole moment, and we show that this dependence can be understood in a relatively simple model based on quantum threshold laws for the scattering of fermionic polar molecules. In addition, we directly observe the spatial anisotropy of the dipolar interaction through measurements of the thermodynamics of the dipolar gas. These results demonstrate how the long-range dipolar interaction can be used for electric-field control of chemical reaction rates in an ultracold gas of polar molecules. Furthermore, the large loss rates in an applied electric field suggest that creating a long-lived ensemble of ultracold polar molecules may require confinement in a two-dimensional trap geometry to suppress the influence of the attractive, 'head-to-tail', dipolar interactions(11-14).","[Ni, K. -K.; Ospelkaus, S.; Wang, D.; Quemener, G.; Neyenhuis, B.; de Miranda, M.

Increased concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases have driven Arctic and global average warming(1,4); however, the underlying causes of Arctic amplification remain uncertain. The roles of reductions in snow and sea ice cover(5-7) and changes in atmospheric and oceanic circulation(8-10), cloud cover and water vapour(11,12) are still matters of debate. A better understanding of the processes responsible for the recent amplified warming is essential for assessing the likelihood, and impacts, of future rapid Arctic warming and sea ice loss(13,14). Here we show that the Arctic warming is strongest at the surface during most of the year and is primarily consistent with reductions in sea ice cover. Changes in cloud cover, in contrast, have not contributed strongly to recent warming. Increases in atmospheric water vapour content, partly in response to reduced sea ice cover, may have enhanced warming in the lower part of the atmosphere during summer and early autumn. We conclude that diminishing sea ice has had a leading role in recent Arctic temperature amplification. The findings reinforce suggestions that strong positive ice-temperature feedbacks have emerged in the Arctic(15), increasing the chances of further rapid warming and sea ice loss, and will probably affect polar ecosystems, ice-sheet mass balance and human activities in the Arctic(2).","[Screen, James A.; Simmonds, Ian] Univ Melbourne, Sch Earth Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia","Screen, JA (reprint author), Univ Melbourne, Sch Earth Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",screenj@unimelb.edu.au,"Screen, James/D-7588-2013","Simmonds, Ian/0000-0002-4479-3255; Screen, James/0000-0003-1728-783X",Australian Research Council,We thank N.

Here we describe an early-juvenile specimen and a late-juvenile specimen, both referable to the oviraptorosaur Similicaudipteryx(8), recovered from the Lower Cretaceous Yixian Formation of western Liaoning, China(9). The two specimens have strikingly different remiges and rectrices, suggesting that a radical morphological change occurred during feather development, as is the case for modern feathers(10). However, both the remiges and the rectrices are proximally ribbon-like in the younger specimen but fully pennaceous in the older specimen, a pattern not known in any modern bird(10). In combination with the wide distribution of proximally ribbon-like pennaceous feathers and elongate broad filamentous feathers among extinct theropods, this find suggests that early feathers were developmentally more diverse than modern ones and that some developmental features, and the resultant morphotypes, have been lost in feather evolution.","[Xu, Xing] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Paleontol & Paleoanthropol, Key Lab Evolutionary Systemat Vertebrates, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Xiaoting] Shandong Tianyu Museum Nat, Pingyi 273300, Shandong, Peoples R China; [You, Hailu] Chinese Acad Geol Sci, Inst Geol, Beijing 100037, Peoples R China","Xu, X (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Paleontol & Paleoanthropol, Key Lab Evolutionary Systemat Vertebrates, 142 Xiwai St, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China.",xingxu@vip.sina.com; ty4291666@163.com,,,Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Natural Science Foundation of China; Special Funds For Major State Basic Research Projects of China,"The authors thank P.-J.

A major mechanism to prevent selfing is the self-incompatibility (SI) recognition system, which consists of male and female specificity genes at the S-locus and SI modifier genes(2-4). Under conditions that favour selfing, mutations disabling the male recognition component are predicted to enjoy a relative advantage over those disabling the female component, because male mutations would increase through both pollen and seeds whereas female mutations would increase only through seeds(5,6). Despite many studies on the genetic basis of loss of SI in the predominantly selfing plant Arabidopsis thaliana(7-15), it remains unknown whether selfing arose through mutations in the female specificity gene (S-receptor kinase, SRK), male specificity gene (S-locus cysteine-rich protein, SCR; also known as S-locus protein 11, SP11) or modifier genes, and whether any of them rose to high frequency across large geographic regions. Here we report that a disruptive 213-base-pair (bp) inversion in the SCR gene (or its derivative haplotypes with deletions encompassing the entire SCR-A and a large portion of SRK-A) is found in 95% of European accessions, which contrasts with the genome-wide pattern of polymorphism in European A. thaliana(16,17). Importantly, interspecific crossings using Arabidopsis halleri as a pollen donor reveal that some A. thaliana accessions, including Wei-1, retain the female SI reaction, suggesting that all female components including SRK are still functional. Moreover, when the 213-bp inversion in SCR was inverted and expressed in transgenic Wei-1 plants, the functional SCR restored the SI reaction. The inversion within SCR is the first mutation disrupting SI shown to be nearly fixed in geographically wide samples, and its prevalence is consistent with theoretical predictions regarding the evolutionary advantage of mutations in male components.","[Tsuchimatsu, Takashi; Shimizu-Inatsugi, Rie; Shimizu, Kentaro K.] Univ Zurich, Inst Plant Biol, Univ Res Prior Program Syst Biol, Funct Genom & Zurich Basel Plant Sci Ctr, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland; [Tsuchimatsu, Takashi] Univ Tokyo, Dept Gen Syst Studies, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1538902, Japan; [Suwabe, Keita; Isokawa, Sachiyo; Watanabe, Masao] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Life Sci, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan; [Suwabe, Keita] Mie Univ, Grad Sch Bioresources, Tsu, Mie 5148507, Japan; [Isokawa, Sachiyo; Watanabe, Masao] Tohoku Univ, Fac Sci, Aoba Ku, Sendai, Miyagi 9808578, Japan; [Pavlidis, Pavlos] Univ Munich LMU, Bioctr, Sect Evolutionary Biol, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany; [Staedler, Thomas] ETH, Inst Integrat Biol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Suzuki, Go] Osaka Kyoiku Univ, Div Nat Sci, Kashiwara 5828582, Japan; [Takayama, Seiji] Nara Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Biol Sci, Ikoma 6300101, Japan","Shimizu, KK (reprint author), Univ Zurich, Inst Plant Biol, Univ Res Prior Program Syst Biol, Funct Genom & Zurich Basel Plant Sci Ctr, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland.",nabe@ige.tohoku.ac.jp; shimizu@botinst.uzh.ch,"Stadler, Thomas/B-7286-2009; Watanabe, Masao/E-6300-2011; Tsuchimatsu, Takashi/A-9218-2017","Stadler, Thomas/0000-0003-4513-8583; Watanabe, Masao/0000-0002-9419-5149; Tsuchimatsu, Takashi/0000-0003-1241-9338; Shimizu, Kentaro K./0000-0002-6483-1781","University of Zurich; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan (MEXT); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS); Volkswagen Foundation; Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD)","We thank P.

Transposons, with their inherent ability to mobilize and amplify within genomes, may be especially prone to HT(3-7). However, the means by which transposons can spread across widely diverged species remain elusive. Here we present evidence that host-parasite interactions have promoted the HT of four transposon families between invertebrates and vertebrates. We found that Rhodnius prolixus, a triatomine bug feeding on the blood of various tetrapods and vector of Chagas' disease in humans, carries in its genome four distinct transposon families that also invaded the genomes of a diverse, but overlapping, set of tetrapods. The bug transposons are similar to 98% identical and cluster phylogenetically with those of the opossum and squirrel monkey, two of its preferred mammalian hosts in South America. We also identified one of these transposon families in the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis, a cosmopolitan vector of trematodes infecting diverse vertebrates, whose ancestral sequence is nearly identical and clusters with those found in Old World mammals. Together these data provide evidence for a previously hypothesized role of host-parasite interactions in facilitating HT among animals(3,7). Furthermore, the large amount of DNA generated by the amplification of the horizontally transferred transposons supports the idea that the exchange of genetic material between hosts and parasites influences their genomic evolution.","[Gilbert, Clement; Schaack, Sarah; Pace, John K., II; Feschotte, Cedric] Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Biol, Arlington, TX 76019 USA; [Brindley, Paul J.] George Washington Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Microbiol Immunol & Trop Med, Washington, DC 20037 USA","Feschotte, C (reprint author), Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Biol, Arlington, TX 76019 USA.",cedric@uta.edu,"Feschotte, Cedric/C-4048-2011; Gilbert, Clement/A-7538-2015","Gilbert, Clement/0000-0002-2131-7467",National Institutes of Health; National Science Foundation,"We thank E.

In multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune demyelinating disease and common cause of neurodegeneration and disability in young adults, disease discordance in monozygotic twins has been interpreted to indicate environmental importance in its pathogenesis(1-8). However, genetic and epigenetic differences between monozygotic twins have been described, challenging the accepted experimental model in disambiguating the effects of nature and nurture(9-12). Here we report the genome sequences of one MS-discordant monozygotic twin pair, and messenger RNA transcriptome and epigenome sequences of CD4(+) lymphocytes from three MS-discordant, monozygotic twin pairs. No reproducible differences were detected between co-twins among similar to 3.6 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or similar to 0.2 million insertion-deletion polymorphisms. Nor were any reproducible differences observed between siblings of the three twin pairs in HLA haplotypes, confirmed MS-susceptibility SNPs, copy number variations, mRNA and genomic SNP and insertion-deletion genotypes, or the expression of similar to 19,000 genes in CD4(+) T cells. Only 2 to 176 differences in the methylation of similar to 2 million CpG dinucleotides were detected between siblings of the three twin pairs, in contrast to similar to 800 methylation differences between T cells of unrelated individuals and several thousand differences between tissues or between normal and cancerous tissues. In the first systematic effort to estimate sequence variation among monozygotic co-twins, we did not find evidence for genetic, epigenetic or transcriptome differences that explained disease discordance. These are the first, to our knowledge, female, twin and autoimmune disease individual genome sequences reported.","[Baranzini, Sergio E.; Khankhanian, Pouya; Caillier, Stacy J.; McElroy, Joseph P.; Gomez, Refujia; Oksenberg, Jorge R.; Hauser, Stephen L.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Neurol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Mudge, Joann; van Velkinburgh, Jennifer C.; Miller, Neil A.; Farmer, Andrew D.; Bell, Callum J.; Kim, Ryan W.; May, Gregory D.; Woodward, Jimmy E.; Clendenen, Leonda E.; Ganusova, Elena E.; Schilkey, Faye D.; Ramaraj, Thiruvarangan; Kingsmore, Stephen F.] Natl Ctr Genome Resources, Santa Fe, NM 87505 USA; [Khrebtukova, Irina; Zhang, Lu; Huntley, Jim J.; Luo, Shujun; Schroth, Gary P.] Illumina Inc, Hayward, CA 94545 USA; [Pando, Marcelo J.] Stanford Med Sch, Ctr Blood, Palo Alto, CA 94303 USA; [Khan, Omar A.] Wayne State Med Sch, Dept Neurol, Detroit, MI 48201 USA; [Kwok, Pui-yan] Univ Calif San Francisco, Cardiovasc Res Inst, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Kwok, Pui-yan; Oksenberg, Jorge R.; Hauser, Stephen L.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Inst Human Genet, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Wu, Thomas D.] Genentech Inc, Dept Bioinformat, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA","Baranzini, SE (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Neurol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",sebaran@cgl.ucsf.edu; sfk@ncgr.org,"Baranzini, Sergio/A-9422-2013; Kwok, Pui-Yan/F-7725-2014; Hauser, Stephen/J-2978-2016; van Velkinburgh, Jennifer/D-7205-2015","Baranzini, Sergio/0000-0003-0067-194X; Kwok, Pui-Yan/0000-0002-5087-3059; van Velkinburgh, Jennifer/0000-0002-4592-2397; kingsmore, stephen/0000-0002-3758-4631; Kingsmore, Stephen/0000-0001-7180-2527","Small Ventures USA Inc.; A.

Germ-free animals are susceptible to atherosclerosis, suggesting that endogenous substances initiate the inflammation(1). Mature atherosclerotic lesions contain macroscopic deposits of cholesterol crystals in the necrotic core, but their appearance late in atherogenesis had been thought to disqualify them as primary inflammatory stimuli. However, using a new microscopic technique, we revealed that minute cholesterol crystals are present in early diet-induced atherosclerotic lesions and that their appearance in mice coincides with the first appearance of inflammatory cells. Other crystalline substances can induce inflammation by stimulating the caspase-1-activating NLRP3 (NALP3 or cryopyrin) inflammasome(2,3), which results in cleavage and secretion of interleukin (IL)-1 family cytokines. Here we show that cholesterol crystals activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in phagocytes in vitro in a process that involves phagolysosomal damage. Similarly, when injected intraperitoneally, cholesterol crystals induce acute inflammation, which is impaired in mice deficient in components of the NLRP3 inflammasome, cathepsin B, cathepsin L or IL-1 molecules. Moreover, when mice deficient in low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) were bone-marrow transplanted with NLRP3-deficient, ASC (also known as PYCARD)-deficient or IL-1 alpha/beta-deficient bone marrow and fed on a high-cholesterol diet, they had markedly decreased early atherosclerosis and inflammasome-dependent IL-18 levels. Minimally modified LDL can lead to cholesterol crystallization concomitant with NLRP3 inflammasome priming and activation in macrophages. Although there is the possibility that oxidized LDL activates the NLRP3 inflammasome in vivo, our results demonstrate that crystalline cholesterol acts as an endogenous danger signal and its deposition in arteries or elsewhere is an early cause rather than a late consequence of inflammation. These findings provide new insights into the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and indicate new potential molecular targets for the therapy of this disease.","[Duewell, Peter; Sirois, Cherilyn M.; Vladimer, Gregory; Lien, Egil; Fitzgerald, Katherine A.; Latz, Eicke] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Immunol & Infect Dis, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Kono, Hajime; Rock, Kenneth L.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Duewell, Peter; Schnurr, Max] Univ Munich, Div Gastroenterol, Dept Med, D-80336 Munich, Germany; [Rayner, Katey J.; Moore, Kathryn J.] NYU, Leon H Charney Div Cardiol, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Rayner, Katey J.; Moore, Kathryn J.; Hornung, Veit] Harvard Univ, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Sch Med, Lipid Metab Unit, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Bauernfeind, Franz G.] Univ Bonn, Inst Clin Chem & Pharmacol, D-53127 Bonn, Germany; [Latz, Eicke] Univ Bonn, Univ Hosp, Inst Innate Immunol, D-53127 Bonn, Germany; [Abela, George S.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Med, Div Cardiol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Franchi, Luigi; Nunez, Gabriel] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Espevik, Terje; Latz, Eicke] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Canc Res & Mol Med, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Wright, Samuel D.] CSL Ltd, Cardiovasc Therapeut, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia","Latz, E (reprint author), Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Immunol & Infect Dis, Worcester, MA 01605 USA.",eicke.latz@umassmed.edu,"Rayner, Katey/K-8914-2012; Duewell, Peter/C-4576-2014; Latz, Eicke/H-3951-2014","Latz, Eicke/0000-0003-1488-5666; Sirois, Cherilyn M./0000-0002-5472-4288; Rayner, Katey/0000-0001-6230-426X; Hornung, Veit/0000-0002-4150-194X; Duewell, Peter/0000-0003-0836-6448; Moore, kathryn/0000-0003-2505-2547",National Institutes of Health; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [GK 1202],"This work was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (to E.

However, T(H)2 cells also promote chronic inflammation associated with asthma and allergic disorders(2). The nonhaematopoietic-cell-derived cytokines thymic stromal lymphopoietin, IL33 and IL25 (also known as IL17E) have been implicated in inducing T(H)2 cell-dependent inflammation at mucosal sites(3-6), but how these cytokines influence innate immune responses remains poorly defined. Here we show that IL25, a member of the IL17 cytokine family, promotes the accumulation of a lineage-negative (Lin(-)) multipotent progenitor (MPP) cell population in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue that promotes T(H)2 cytokine responses. The IL25-elicited cell population, termed MPPtype2 cells, was defined by the expression of Sca-1 (also known as Ly6a) and intermediate expression of c-Kit (c-Kit(int)), and exhibited multipotent capacity, giving rise to cells of monocyte/macrophage and granulocyte lineages both in vitro and in vivo. Progeny of MPPtype2 cells were competent antigen presenting cells, and adoptive transfer of MPPtype2 cells could promote T(H)2 cytokine responses and confer protective immunity to helminth infection in normally susceptible Il25(-/-) mice. The ability of IL25 to induce the emergence of an MPPtype2 cell population identifies a link between the IL17 cytokine family and extramedullary haematopoiesis, and suggests a previously unrecognized innate immune pathway that promotes T(H)2 cytokine responses at mucosal sites.","[Saenz, Steven A.; Siracusa, Mark C.; Perrigoue, Jacqueline G.; Spencer, Sean P.; Artis, David] Univ Penn, Dept Pathobiol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Kambayashi, Taku; Bhandoola, Avinash] Univ Penn, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Urban, Joseph F., Jr.] USDA, Diet Genom & Immunol Lab, Beltsville Human Nutr Res Ctr, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA; [Tocker, Joel E.; Budelsky, Alison L.] Amgen Inc, Dept Inflammat Res, Seattle, WA 98119 USA; [Kleinschek, Melanie A.; Kastelein, Robert A.] Schering Plough Biopharma, Discovery Res, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA","Artis, D (reprint author), Univ Penn, Dept Pathobiol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",dartis@vet.upenn.edu,,"Urban, Joseph/0000-0002-1590-8869","National Institutes of Health [AI61570, AI074878, AI083480, GM082187, AI007532-08]; Burroughs Wellcome Fund; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive Kidney Disease Center [P30 DK50306]; University of Pennsylvania (URF, VCID and PGI)","We thank members of the Artis laboratory for constructive discussions, M.

Type-2 immunity-responsible for protective immune responses to helminth parasites(1,2) and the underlying cause of the pathogenesis of allergic asthma(3,4)-consists of responses dominated by the cardinal type-2 cytokines interleukin (IL) 4, IL5 and IL13 (ref. 5). T cells are an important source of these cytokines in adaptive immune responses, but the innate cell sources remain to be comprehensively determined. Here, through the use of novel Il13-eGFP reporter mice, we present the identification and functional characterization of a new innate type-2 immune effector leukocyte that we have named the nuocyte. Nuocytes expand in vivo in response to the type-2-inducing cytokines IL25 and IL33, and represent the predominant early source of IL13 during helminth infection with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. In the combined absence of IL25 and IL33 signalling, nuocytes fail to expand, resulting in a severe defect in worm expulsion that is rescued by the adoptive transfer of in vitro cultured wild-type, but not IL13-deficient, nuocytes. Thus, nuocytes represent a critically important innate effector cell in type-2 immunity.","[Neill, Daniel R.; Wong, See Heng; Bellosi, Agustin; Flynn, Robin J.; Daly, Maria; Langford, Theresa K.

IL-23-driven inflammation has primarily been linked to the actions of T-helper type 17 (T(H)17) cells(1). Somewhat overlooked, IL-23 also has inflammatory effects on innate immune cells(2) and can drive T-cell-independent colitis. However, the downstream cellular and molecular pathways involved in this innate intestinal inflammatory response are poorly characterized. Here we show that bacteria-driven innate colitis is associated with an increased production of IL-17 and interferon-gamma in the colon. Stimulation of colonic leukocytes with IL-23 induced the production of IL-17 and interferon-gamma exclusively by innate lymphoid cells expressing Thy1, stem cell antigen 1 (SCA-1), retinoic-acid-related orphan receptor (ROR)-gamma t and IL-23R, and these cells markedly accumulated in the inflamed colon. IL-23-responsive innate intestinal cells are also a feature of T-cell-dependent models of colitis. The transcription factor ROR-gamma t, which controls IL-23R expression, has a functional role, because Rag(-/-) Rorc(-/-) mice failed to develop innate colitis. Last, depletion of Thy1(+) innate lymphoid cells completely abrogated acute and chronic innate colitis. These results identify a previously unrecognized IL-23-responsive innate lymphoid population that mediates intestinal immune pathology and may therefore represent a target in inflammatory bowel disease.","[Buonocore, Sofia; Ahern, Philip P.; Maloy, Kevin J.; Powrie, Fiona] Univ Oxford, Sir William Dunn Sch Pathol, Oxford OX1 3RE, England; [Powrie, Fiona] Univ Oxford, John Radcliffe Hosp, Nuffield Dept Clin Med, Translat Gastroenterol Unit, Oxford OX3 9DU, England; [Uhlig, Holm H.] Univ Childrens Hosp, D-04317 Leipzig, Germany; [Ivanov, Ivaylo I.; Littman, Dan R.] NYU, Sch Med, Kimmel Ctr Biol & Med,Skirball Inst, Mol Pathogenesis Program,Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10016 USA","Powrie, F (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Sir William Dunn Sch Pathol, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3RE, England.",kevin.maloy@path.ox.ac.uk; fiona.powrie@path.ox.ac.uk,,,Wellcome Trust; Marie-Curie Network [MRTN-CT2004-006532]; Philippe Wiener-Maurice Anspach; European Crohn's & Colitis Organisation (ECCO); European Commission [223151]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute Exchange Programme,"We thank N.

Although the most notable clinical aspects of the disease only become apparent during late adolescence or early adulthood, many lines of evidence suggest that schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental disorder with a strong genetic component(1,2). Several independent studies have identified neuregulin 1 (NRG1) and its receptor ERBB4 as important risk genes for schizophrenia(3,4), although their precise role in the disease process remains unknown. Here we show that Nrg1 and ErbB4 signalling controls the development of inhibitory circuitries in the mammalian cerebral cortex by cell-autonomously regulating the connectivity of specific GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid)-containing interneurons. In contrast to the prevalent view, which supports a role for these genes in the formation and function of excitatory synapses between pyramidal cells, we found that ErbB4 expression in the mouse neocortex and hippocampus is largely confined to certain classes of interneurons. In particular, ErbB4 is expressed by many parvalbumin-expressing chandelier and basket cells, where it localizes to axon terminals and postsynaptic densities receiving glutamatergic input. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments, both in vitro and in vivo, demonstrate that ErbB4 cell-autonomously promotes the formation of axo-axonic inhibitory synapses over pyramidal cells, and that this function is probably mediated by Nrg1. In addition, ErbB4 expression in GABA-containing interneurons regulates the formation of excitatory synapses onto the dendrites of these cells. By contrast, ErbB4 is dispensable for excitatory transmission between pyramidal neurons. Altogether, our results indicate that Nrg1 and ErbB4 signalling is required for the wiring of GABA-mediated circuits in the postnatal cortex, providing a new perspective to the involvement of these genes in the aetiology of schizophrenia.","[Fazzari, Pietro; Paternain, Ana V.; Valiente, Manuel; Pla, Ramon; Lerma, Juan; Marin, Oscar; Rico, Beatriz] CSIC, Inst Neurociencias, Sant Joan dAlacant 03550, Spain; [Fazzari, Pietro; Paternain, Ana V.; Valiente, Manuel; Pla, Ramon; Lerma, Juan; Marin, Oscar; Rico, Beatriz] Univ Miguel Hernandez, Sant Joan dAlacant 03550, Spain; [Lujan, Rafael] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Med, Dept Ciencias Med, Albacete 02006, Spain; [Lloyd, Kent] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Internal Med, Calif Natl Primate Res Ctr, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Marin, O (reprint author), CSIC, Inst Neurociencias, Sant Joan dAlacant 03550, Spain.",o.marin@umh.es; brico@umh.es,"Marin, Oscar/F-3856-2012; Valiente, Manuel/J-9523-2014; Lerma, Juan/G-7907-2015","Marin, Oscar/0000-0001-6264-7027; Valiente, Manuel/0000-0002-0647-7542; Lerma, Juan/0000-0001-7838-5199; Fazzari, Pietro/0000-0003-3457-9201","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [SAF2008-00770, SAF2007-61904, BFU2006-07138, CSD2007-00023]; Consejeria de Educacion y Ciencia de la Junta de Comunidades de Castilla-La Mancha [PAI08-0174-6967]; fundacio la Caixa; EURYI; Marie Curie Intra-European Fellowship","We thank G.

IL-6 and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) induce TH17 development, in which the orphan nuclear receptors, ROR gamma t and ROR alpha, have an indispensable role(4-6). However, in the absence of IL-6 and TGF-beta, the ectopic expression of ROR gamma t or ROR alpha leads to only a modest IL-17 production(5,7,8). Here we identify a nuclear I kappa B family member, I kappa B zeta (encoded by the Nfkbiz gene), as a transcription factor required for TH17 development in mice. The ectopic expression of I kappa B zeta in naive CD4(+) T cells together with ROR gamma t or ROR alpha potently induces T(H)17 development, even in the absence of IL-6 and TGF-beta. Notably, Nfkbiz(-/-) mice have a defect in T(H)17 development and a resistance to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). The T-cell-intrinsic function of I kappa B zeta was clearly demonstrated by the resistance to EAE of the Rag2(-/-) mice into which Nfkbiz(-/-) CD4(+) T cells were transferred. In cooperation with ROR gamma t and RORa, I kappa B zeta enhances Il17a expression by binding directly to the regulatory region of the Il17a gene. This study provides evidence for the transcriptional mechanisms underlying T(H)17 development and points to a molecular basis for a novel therapeutic strategy against autoimmune disease.","[Okamoto, Kazuo; Oh-hora, Masatsugu; Takayanagi, Hiroshi] Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Grad Sch Med & Dent Sci, Dept Cell Signaling, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138549, Japan; [Okamoto, Kazuo; Oh-hora, Masatsugu; Takayanagi, Hiroshi] Int Res Ctr Mol Sci Tooth & Bone Dis, Global Ctr Excellence Program, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138549, Japan; [Okamoto, Kazuo; Takayanagi, Hiroshi] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, ERATO, Takayanagi Osteonetwork Project, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138549, Japan; [Iwai, Yoshiko] Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Med Res Inst, Med Top Track Program, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138510, Japan; [Yamamoto, Masahiro] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Lab Immune Regulat, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Akira, Shizuo] Osaka Univ, WPI Immunol Frontier Res Ctr, Host Def Lab, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Morio, Tomohiro] Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Grad Sch Med & Dent Sci, Dept Pediat & Dev Biol, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138519, Japan; [Aoki, Kazuhiro; Ohya, Keiichi] Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Grad Sch Med & Dent Sci, Dept Hard Tissue Engn Pharmacol, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138549, Japan; [Jetten, Anton M.] NIEHS, Cell Biol Sect, Div Intramural Res, NIH, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Muta, Tatsushi] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Life Sci, Lab Cell Recognit & Response, Aoba Ku, Sendai, Miyagi 9808578, Japan","Takayanagi, H (reprint author), Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Grad Sch Med & Dent Sci, Dept Cell Signaling, Bunkyo Ku, Yushima 1-5-45, Tokyo 1138549, Japan.",taka.csi@tmd.ac.jp,"Akira, Shizuo/C-3134-2009","Jetten, Anton/0000-0003-0954-4445","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan (MEXT); ERATO; JST; NIEHS [Z01-ES-101586]; Takeda Life Science Foundation; Yokoyama Foundation; Ichiro Kanehara","We are grateful to Y.

Light isomerizes rhodopsin's retinal chromophore and triggers concerted movements of transmembrane helices, including an outward tilting of helix 6 (H6) and a smaller movement of H5, to create a site for G-protein binding and activation(3,4). However, the precise temporal sequence and mechanism underlying these helix rearrangements is unclear. We used site-directed non-natural amino acid mutagenesis to engineer rhodopsin with p-azido-L-phenylalanine residues incorporated at selected sites(5), and monitored the azido vibrational signatures using infrared spectroscopy as rhodopsin proceeded along its activation pathway. Here we report significant changes in electrostatic environments of the azido probes even in the inactive photoproduct Meta I, well before the active receptor state was formed. These early changes suggest a significant rotation of H6 and movement of the cytoplasmic part of H5 away from H3. Subsequently, a large outward tilt of H6 leads to opening of the cytoplasmic surface to form the active receptor photoproduct Meta II(3). Thus, our results reveal early conformational changes that precede larger rigid-body helix movements, and provide a basis to interpret recent GPCR crystal structures(6,7) and to understand conformational sub-states observed during the activation of other GPCRs(8).","[Zaitseva, Ekaterina; Vogel, Reiner] Univ Freiburg, Inst Mol Med & Cell Res, Biophys Sect, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Ye, Shixin; Sakmar, Thomas P.] Rockefeller Univ, Biochem & Mol Biol Lab, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Caltabiano, Gianluigi; Deupi, Xavier] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Unitat Bioestadist, Lab Med Computac, Bellaterra 08193, Catalunya, Spain; [Schertler, Gebhard F.

We show that wing spots are induced by the Wingless morphogen, which is expressed at many discrete sites that are specified by pre-existing positional information that governs the development of wing structures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the elaborate spot pattern evolved from simpler schemes by co-option of Wingless expression at new sites.

Nevertheless, they show increased self-duplication after increased metabolic demand or after injury (that is, beta-cell loss). It is not known whether adult mammals can differentiate (regenerate) new-beta-cells after extreme, total beta-cell loss, as in diabetes. This would indicate differentiation from precursors or another heterologous (non-beta-cell) source. Here we show beta-cell regeneration in a transgenicmodel of diphtheria-toxin-induced acute selective near-total beta-cell ablation.

Lineage-tracing to label the glucagon-producing alpha-cells before beta-cell ablation tracked large fractions of regenerated beta-cells as deriving from alpha-cells, revealing a previously disregarded degree of pancreatic cell plasticity.

Although these features are processed vertically across cortical layers, horizontal projections interconnecting neighbouring cortical domains allow these features to be processed in a context-dependent manner. Despite the wealth of physiological and psychophysical studies addressing the function of horizontal projections, how they coordinate activity among cortical domains remains poorly understood. We addressed this question by selectively activating horizontal projection neurons in mouse somatosensory cortex, and determined how the resulting spatial pattern of excitation and inhibition affects cortical activity. We found that horizontal projections suppress superficial layers while simultaneously activating deeper cortical output layers. This layer-specific modulation does not result from a spatial separation of excitation and inhibition, but from a layer-specific ratio between these two opposing conductances. Through this mechanism, cortical domains exploit horizontal projections to compete for cortical space.","[Adesnik, Hillel; Scanziani, Massimo] Univ Calif San Diego, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Ctr Neural Circuits & Behav, Neurobiol Sect, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Adesnik, Hillel; Scanziani, Massimo] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Neurosci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Scanziani, M (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Ctr Neural Circuits & Behav, Neurobiol Sect, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",massimo@ucsd.edu,,,National Institute for Mental Health [R01 MH70058]; Helen Hay Whitney Foundation,"We thank P.

Previous work(5) using transmission spectroscopy failed to detect the 1.4-mu m-water vapour band, leaving the planet's atmospheric composition poorly constrained. Here we report the detection of planetary thermal emission from the dayside of GJ 436b at multiple infrared wavelengths during the secondary eclipse.

Moreover, we report the presence of some H(2)O and traces of CO(2). Because CH(4) is expected to be the dominant carbon-bearing species, disequilibrium processes such as vertical mixing(9) and polymerization of methane(10) into substances such as ethylene may be required to explain the hot Neptune's small CH(4)-to-CO ratio, which is at least 10(5) times smaller than predicted(6).","[Stevenson, Kevin B.; Harrington, Joseph; Nymeyer, Sarah; Bowman, William C.; Hardy, Ryan A.; Lust, Nate B.] Univ Cent Florida, Dept Phys, Planetary Sci Grp, Orlando, FL 32816 USA; [Madhusudhan, Nikku; Seager, Sara] MIT, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Madhusudhan, Nikku; Seager, Sara] MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Deming, Drake] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Planetary Syst Lab, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Rauscher, Emily] Columbia Univ, Dept Astron, New York, NY 10027 USA","Stevenson, KB (reprint author), Univ Cent Florida, Dept Phys, Planetary Sci Grp, Orlando, FL 32816 USA.",kevin218@knights.ucf.edu,"Harrington, Joseph/E-6250-2011","Hardy, Ryan/0000-0002-3849-9551; Harrington, Joseph/0000-0002-8955-8531; Stevenson, Kevin/0000-0002-7352-7941; Rauscher, Emily/0000-0003-3963-9672",US NSF; US NASA; JPL/Caltech,"We thank the Spitzer staff for rapid scheduling; M.

The quantum wave properties of particles are exploited in metrology using atom interferometers, allowing for high-precision inertia measurements(1,2). Furthermore, the state-of-the-art time standard is based on an interferometric technique known as Ramsey spectroscopy. However, the precision of an interferometer is limited by classical statistics owing to the finite number of atoms used to deduce the quantity of interest(3). Here we show experimentally that the classical precision limit can be surpassed using nonlinear atom interferometry with a Bose-Einstein condensate. Controlled interactions between the atoms lead to non-classical entangled states within the interferometer; this represents an alternative approach to the use of non-classical input states(4-8). Extending quantum interferometry(9) to the regime of large atom number, we find that phase sensitivity is enhanced by 15 per cent relative to that in an ideal classical measurement. Our nonlinear atomic beam splitter follows the 'one-axis-twisting' scheme(10) and implements interaction control using a narrow Feshbach resonance. We perform noise tomography of the quantum state within the interferometer and detect coherent spin squeezing with a squeezing factor of -8.2 dB (refs 11-15).

They have been used in diverse experiments involving low-dimensional quantum gases(2), cavity quantum electrodynamics(3), atom-surface interactions(4,5), and chip-based atomic clocks(6) and interferometers(7,8). However, a severe limitation of atom chips is that techniques to control atomic interactions and to generate entanglement have not been experimentally available so far. Such techniques enable chip-based studies of entangled many-body systems and are a key prerequisite for atom chip applications in quantum simulations(9), quantum information processing(10) and quantum metrology(11). Here we report the experimental generation of multi-particle entanglement on an atom chip by controlling elastic collisional interactions with a state-dependent potential(12). We use this technique to generate spin-squeezed states of a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate(13); such states are a useful resource for quantum metrology. The observed reduction in spin noise of -3.7 +/- 0.4 dB, combined with the spin coherence, implies four-partite entanglement between the condensate atoms(14); this could be used to improve an interferometric measurement by -2.5 +/- 0.6 dB over the standard quantum limit(15). Our data show good agreement with a dynamical multi-mode simulation(16) and allow us to reconstruct the Wigner function(17) of the spin-squeezed condensate.

For liquids in contact with solids, crystalline surfaces induce layering of the adjacent atoms in the liquid(4,5) and may prevent or lower supercooling(6). This seed effect is supposed to depend on the local lateral order adopted in the last atomic layers of the liquid in contact with the crystal. Although it has been suggested that there might be a direct coupling between surface-induced lateral order and supercooling(6), no experimental observation of such lateral ordering at interfaces is available(6). Here we report supercooling in gold-silicon (AuSi) eutectic droplets, enhanced by a Au-induced (6 x 6) reconstruction of the Si(111) substrate. In situ X-ray scattering and ab initio molecular dynamics reveal that pentagonal atomic arrangements of Au atoms at this interface favour a lateral-ordering stabilization process of the liquid phase. This interface-enhanced stabilization of the liquid state shows the importance of the solid-liquid interaction for the structure of the adjacent liquid layers. Such processes are important for present and future technologies, as fluidity and crystallization play a key part in soldering and casting, as well as in processing and controlling chemical reactions for microfluidic devices or during the vapour-liquid-solid growth of semiconductor nanowires.","[Schuelli, T.

This reorganization of the nitrogen cycle has led to an increase in food production(2), but increasingly causes a number of environmental problems(1,3). One such problem is the accumulation of nitrate in both freshwater and coastal marine ecosystems. Here we establish that ecosystem nitrate accrual exhibits consistent and negative nonlinear correlations with organic carbon availability along a hydrologic continuum from soils, through freshwater systems and coastal margins, to the open ocean. The trend also prevails in ecosystems subject to substantial human alteration. Across this diversity of environments, we find evidence that resource stoichiometry ( organic carbon: nitrate) strongly influences nitrate accumulation by regulating a suite of microbial processes that couple dissolved organic carbon and nitrate cycling. With the help of a meta-analysis we show that heterotrophic microbes maintain low nitrate concentrations when organic carbon: nitrate ratios match the stoichiometric demands of microbial anabolism. When resource ratios drop below the minimum carbon: nitrogen ratio of microbial biomass(4), however, the onset of carbon limitation appears to drive rapid nitrate accrual, which may then be further enhanced by nitrification. At low organic carbon: nitrate ratios, denitrification appears to constrain the extent of nitrate accretion, once organic carbon and nitrate availability approach the 1: 1 stoichiometry(5) of this catabolic process. Collectively, these microbial processes express themselves on local to global scales by restricting the threshold ratios underlying nitrate accrual to a constrained stoichiometric window. Our findings indicate that ecological stoichiometry can help explain the fate of nitrate across disparate environments and in the face of human disturbance.","[Taylor, Philip G.; Townsend, Alan R.] Univ Colorado, INSTAAR, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Taylor, Philip G.; Townsend, Alan R.] Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","Taylor, PG (reprint author), Univ Colorado, INSTAAR, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",philip.taylor@colorado.edu,,,,,,30,143,150,21,266,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,22-Apr,2010,464,7292,,,,,1178,1181,,10.1038/nature08985,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,586FR,WOS:000276891100034,20414306.0,No,,,11/20/17,alan r.,townsend,na,na,na,na,na

Two-photon calcium imaging can monitor activity of spatially defined neuronal ensembles in the mammalian cortex(2-5). Here we applied this technique to the motor cortex of mice performing a choice behaviour. Head-fixed mice were trained to lick in response to one of two odours, and to withhold licking for the other odour(6,7). Mice routinely showed significant learning within the first behavioural session and across sessions. Microstimulation(8,9) and trans-synaptic tracing(10,11) identified two non-overlapping candidate tongue motor cortical areas. Inactivating either area impaired voluntary licking. Imaging in layer 2/3 showed neurons with diverse response types in both areas. Activity in approximately half of the imaged neurons distinguished trial types associated with different actions. Many neurons showed modulation coinciding with or preceding the action, consistent with their involvement in motor control. Neurons with different response types were spatially intermingled. Nearby neurons (within similar to 150 mm) showed pronounced coincident activity. These temporal correlations increased with learning within and across behavioural sessions, specifically for neuron pairs with similar response types. We propose that correlated activity in specific ensembles of functionally related neurons is a signature of learning-related circuit plasticity. Our findings reveal a fine-scale and dynamic organization of the frontal cortex that probably underlies flexible behaviour.","[Komiyama, Takaki; Sato, Takashi R.; O'Connor, Daniel H.; Zhang, Ying-Xin; Huber, Daniel; Hooks, Bryan M.; Svoboda, Karel] HHMI, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA; [Gabitto, Mariano] Univ Calif San Diego, HHMI, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Gabitto, Mariano] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Neurobiol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Gabitto, Mariano] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Neurosci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Komiyama, T (reprint author), HHMI, Janelia Farm Res Campus, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA.",komiyamat@janelia.hhmi.org,"Huber, Daniel/C-2932-2013",,Howard Hughes Medical Institute,"We thank D.

Although widespread differences in gene expression among individuals of a species have been observed(3-8), studies to examine the variability of transcription factor binding on a global scale have not been performed, and thus the extent and underlying genetic basis of transcription factor binding diversity is unknown. By mapping differences in transcription factor binding among individuals, here we present the genetic basis of such variation on a genome-wide scale. Whole-genome Ste12-binding profiles were determined using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with DNA sequencing in pheromone-treated cells of 43 segregants of a cross between two highly diverged yeast strains and their parental lines. We identified extensive Ste12-binding variation among individuals, and mapped underlying cis- and trans-acting loci responsible for such variation. We showed that most transcription factor binding variation is cis- linked, and that many variations are associated with polymorphisms residing in the binding motifs of Ste12 as well as those of several proposed Ste12 cofactors. We also identified two transfactors, AMN1 and FLO8, that modulate Ste12 binding to promoters of more than ten genes under alpha-factor treatment. Neither of these two genes was previously known to regulate Ste12, and we suggest that they may be mediators of gene activity and phenotypic diversity. Ste12 binding strongly correlates with gene expression for more than 200 genes, indicating that binding variation is functional. Many of the variable-bound genes are involved in cell wall organization and biogenesis. Overall, these studies identified genetic regulators of molecular diversity among individuals and provide new insights into mechanisms of gene regulation.","[Zheng, Wei; Snyder, Michael] Yale Univ, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Zhao, Hongyu] Yale Univ, Program Computat Biol & Bioinformat, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Zhao, Hongyu] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Mancera, Eugenio; Steinmetz, Lars M.] European Mol Biol Lab, Genome Biol Unit, Heidelberg, Germany; [Snyder, Michael] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Snyder, M (reprint author), Yale Univ, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",mpsnyder@stanford.edu,,"Steinmetz, Lars/0000-0002-3962-2865",National Institutes of Health (NIH) [RR19895],"We thank J.

Post-translational modifications are unique mechanisms that allow cells to rapidly, locally and specifically modify activity or interactions of key proteins. Some of these modifications, including phosphorylation and ubiquitylation(1,2), can be induced by pathogens. However, the effects of pathogenic bacteria on SUMOylation, an essential post-translational modification in eukaryotic cells(3), remain largely unknown. Here we show that infection with Listeria monocytogenes leads to a decrease in the levels of cellular SUMO-conjugated proteins. This event is triggered by the bacterial virulence factor listeriolysin O (LLO), which induces a proteasome-independent degradation of Ubc9, an essential enzyme of the SUMOylation machinery, and a proteasome-dependent degradation of some SUMOylated proteins. The effect of LLO on Ubc9 is dependent on the pore-forming capacity of the toxin and is shared by other bacterial pore-forming toxins like perfringolysin O(PFO) and pneumolysin (PLY). Ubc9 degradation was also observed in vivo in infected mice. Furthermore, we show that SUMO overexpression impairs bacterial infection. Together, our results reveal that Listeria, and probably other pathogens, dampen the host response by decreasing the SUMOylation level of proteins critical for infection.","[Ribet, David; Hamon, Melanie; Gouin, Edith; Nahori, Marie-Anne; Cossart, Pascale] Inst Pasteur, Dept Biol Cellulaire & Infect, Unite Interact Bacteries Cellules, F-75015 Paris, France; [Ribet, David; Hamon, Melanie; Gouin, Edith; Nahori, Marie-Anne; Cossart, Pascale] INRA, USC2020, F-75015 Paris, France; [Ribet, David; Hamon, Melanie; Gouin, Edith; Nahori, Marie-Anne; Cossart, Pascale] INSERM, U604, F-75015 Paris, France; [Impens, Francis; Gevaert, Kris; Vandekerckhove, Joel] VIB, Dept Med Prot Res, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Impens, Francis; Gevaert, Kris; Vandekerckhove, Joel] Univ Ghent, Dept Biochem, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Neyret-Kahn, Helene; Dejean, Anne] Inst Pasteur, Dept Biol Cellulaire & Infect, Unite Org Nucl & Oncogenese, F-75015 Paris, France; [Neyret-Kahn, Helene; Dejean, Anne] INSERM, U579, F-75015 Paris, France","Cossart, P (reprint author), Inst Pasteur, Dept Biol Cellulaire & Infect, Unite Interact Bacteries Cellules, F-75015 Paris, France.",pascale.cossart@pasteur.fr,"Impens, Francis/C-3335-2009; Hamon, Melanie/B-3501-2013; Gevaert, Kris/H-3637-2013; Gevaert, Kris/D-6489-2017","Gevaert, Kris/0000-0002-4237-0283; Gevaert, Kris/0000-0002-4237-0283",Institut Pasteur; INSERM; INRA; European Research Council (ERC) [233348]; Fund for Scientific Research Flanders (Belgium) [G.0042.07]; Concerted Research Actions [BOF07/GOA/012]; Ghent University; Inter University Attraction Poles [IUAP06]; Association pour la Recherche sur le Cancer; Research Assistant of the Research Foundation - Flanders (Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek - Vlaanderen),"We thank V.

During vertebrate embryogenesis, vascular patterning is initially guided by conserved genetic pathways that act before circulation(4). Subsequently, endothelial cells must incorporate the mechanosensory stimulus of blood flow with these early signals to shape the embryonic vascular system(4). However, few details are known about how these signals are integrated during development. To investigate this process, we focused on the aortic arch (AA) blood vessels, which are known to remodel in response to blood flow(1). By using two-photon imaging of live zebrafish embryos, we observe that flow is essential for angiogenesis during AA development. We further find that angiogenic sprouting of AA vessels requires a flow-induced genetic pathway in which the mechano-sensitive zinc finger transcription factor klf2a(5-7) induces expression of an endothelial-specific microRNA, mir-126, to activate Vegf signalling. Taken together, our work describes a novel genetic mechanism in which a microRNA facilitates integration of a physiological stimulus with growth factor signalling in endothelial cells to guide angiogenesis.","[Nicoli, Stefania; Lawson, Nathan D.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Program Gene Funct & Express, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Standley, Clive; Fogarty, Kevin E.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Program Mol Med, Biomed Imaging Grp, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Walker, Paul; Hurlstone, Adam] Univ Manchester, Fac Life Sci, Mol Canc Studies Grp, Manchester M13 9PT, Lancs, England","Lawson, ND (reprint author), Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Program Gene Funct & Express, Worcester, MA 01605 USA.",nathan.lawson@umassmed.edu,,"Hurlstone, Adam/0000-0001-5260-9457","National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and National Cancer Institute; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, Diabetes Endocrinology Research Center (DERC) [DK32520]","We would like to thank B.

However, using in vivo multiphoton imaging to observe tangles and activation of executioner caspases in living tau transgenic mice (Tg4510 strain), we find the opposite: caspase activation occurs first, and precedes tangle formation by hours to days. New tangles form within a day. After a new tangle forms, the neuron remains alive and caspase activity seems to be suppressed. Similarly, introduction of wild-type 4-repeat tau (tau-4R) into wild-type animals triggered caspase activation, tau truncation and tau aggregation. Adeno-associated virus-mediated expression of a construct mimicking caspase-cleaved tau into wild-type mice led to the appearance of intracellular aggregates, tangle-related conformational-and phospho-epitopes, and the recruitment of full-length endogenous tau to the aggregates. On the basis of these data, we propose a new model in which caspase activation cleaves tau to initiate tangle formation, then truncated tau recruits normal tau to misfold and form tangles. Because tangle-bearing neurons are long-lived, we suggest that tangles are 'off pathway' to acute neuronal death. Soluble tau species, rather than fibrillar tau, may be the critical toxic moiety underlying neurodegeneration.","[de Calignon, Alix; Fox, Leora M.; Bacskai, Brian J.; Spires-Jones, Tara L.; Hyman, Bradley T.] Harvard Univ, Alzheimers Dis Res Lab, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, MassGen Inst Neurodegenerat Dis,Dept Neurol,Med S, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [de Calignon, Alix] Univ Paris 06, F-75005 Paris, France; [Pitstick, Rose; Carlson, George A.] McLaughlin Res Inst, Great Falls, MT 59401 USA","Hyman, BT (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Alzheimers Dis Res Lab, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, MassGen Inst Neurodegenerat Dis,Dept Neurol,Med S, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA.",bhyman@partners.org,,"Spires-Jones, Tara/0000-0003-2530-0598",Alzheimer's disease Drug Discovery Foundation; Harvard Medical School Shore Award;  [AG08487];  [AG 026249];  [K99 AG033670-01A1],"This work was supported by AG08487, AG 026249, K99 AG033670-01A1, Alzheimer's disease Drug Discovery Foundation, Harvard Medical School Shore Award.

In vitro FTO protein is an AlkB-like DNA/RNA demethylase with a strong preference for 3-methylthymidine (3-meT) in single-stranded DNA or 3-methyluracil (3-meU) in single-stranded RNA(6-8). Here we report the crystal structure of FTO in complex with the mononucleotide 3-meT. FTO comprises an amino-terminal AlkB-like domain and a carboxy-terminal domain with a novel fold. Biochemical assays show that these two domains interact with each other, which is required for FTO catalytic activity. In contrast with the structures of other AlkB members, FTO possesses an extra loop covering one side of the conserved jelly-roll motif. Structural comparison shows that this loop selectively competes with the unmethylated strand of the DNA duplex for binding to FTO, suggesting that it has an important role in FTO selection against double-stranded nucleic acids. The ability of FTO to distinguish 3-meT or 3-meU from other nucleotides is conferred by its hydrogen-bonding interaction with the two carbonyl oxygen atoms in 3-meT or 3-meU. Taken together, these results provide a structural basis for understanding FTO substrate-specificity, and serve as a foundation for the rational design of FTO inhibitors.","[Han, Zhifu; Niu, Tianhui; Lei, Xiaoguang; Zhao, Mingyan; Cheng, Wei; Wang, Jinjing; Feng, Yi; Chai, Jijie] Natl Inst Biol Sci, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China; [Niu, Tianhui] China Agr Univ, Coll Biol Sci, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China; [Chang, Junbiao; Wang, Qiang] Zhengzhou Univ, Dept Chem, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China; [Lei, Xiaoguang] Tianjin Univ, Sch Pharmaceut Sci & Technol, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China; [Chai, Jijie] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Biol Sci & Biotechnol, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China","Chai, JJ (reprint author), Natl Inst Biol Sci, 7 Sci Pk Rd, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China.",chaijijie@nibs.ac.cn,"chang, junbiao/P-1095-2014","chang, junbiao/0000-0001-6236-1256","Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology [2008AA022305, 2006CB806704, 2008AA022317]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [30825043]","We thank Y.

Two modes of electron flow exist-linear electron flow (LEF) from water to NADP 1 via photosystem (PS) II and PSI in series(1) and cyclic electron flow (CEF) around PSI (ref. 2). Although CEF is essential for satisfying the varying demand for ATP, the exact molecule(s) and operational site are as yet unclear. In the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the electron flow shifts from LEF to CEF on preferential excitation of PSII (ref. 3), which is brought about by an energy balancing mechanism between PSII and PSI (state transitions(4)). Here, we isolated a protein super-complex composed of PSI with its own light-harvesting complex (LHCI), the PSII light-harvesting complex (LHCII), the cytochrome b(6)f complex (Cyt bf), ferredoxin (Fd)-NADPH oxidoreductase (FNR), and the integral membrane protein PGRL1 (ref. 5) from C. reinhardtii cells under PSII-favouring conditions. Spectroscopic analyses indicated that on illumination, reducing equivalents from downstream of PSI were transferred to Cyt bf, whereas oxidised PSI was re-reduced by reducing equivalents from Cyt bf, indicating that this supercomplex is engaged in CEF (Supplementary Fig. 1). Thus, formation and dissociation of the PSI-LHCI-LHCII-FNR-Cyt bf-PGRL1 supercomplex not only controlled the energy balance of the two photosystems, but also switched the mode of photosynthetic electron flow.","[Iwai, Masakazu; Takizawa, Kenji; Tokutsu, Ryutaro; Minagawa, Jun] Hokkaido Univ, Inst Low Temp Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600819, Japan; [Okamuro, Akira; Takahashi, Yuichiro] Okayama Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Okayama 7008530, Japan","Minagawa, J (reprint author), Hokkaido Univ, Inst Low Temp Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600819, Japan.",minagawa@lowtem.hokudai.ac.jp,"TAKAHASHI, Yuichiro/B-2062-2011","TAKAHASHI, Yuichiro/0000-0001-6410-0447","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology [18GS0318, 2120006309, 2157003109]; Japan Science and Technology Agency; Natural Sciences by the Mitsubishi Foundation","We thank S.

A key feature of biological sources of strand breaks is associated nucleotide damage, including base loss (abasic or apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites)(2). At single-strand breaks, 5'-terminal abasic sites are excised by the 5'-deoxyribose-5-phosphate (5'-dRP) lyase activity of DNA polymerase beta (pol beta)(3-6): here we show, in vitro and in cells, that accurate and efficient repair by NHEJ of double-strand breaks with such damage similarly requires 5'-dRP/AP lyase activity. Classically defined NHEJ is moreover uniquely effective at coupling this end-cleaning step to joining in cells, helping to distinguish this pathway from otherwise robust alternative NHEJ pathways. The NHEJ factor Ku can be identified as an effective 5'-dRP/AP lyase. In a similar manner to other lyases(7), Ku nicks DNA 3' of an abasic site by a mechanism involving a Schiff-base covalent intermediate with the abasic site. We show by using cell extracts that Ku is essential for the efficient removal of AP sites near double-strand breaks and, consistent with this result, that joining of such breaks is specifically decreased in cells complemented with a lyase-attenuated Ku mutant. Ku had previously been presumed only to recognize ends and recruit other factors that process ends; our data support an unexpected direct role for Ku in end-processing steps as well.","[Roberts, Steven A.; Strande, Natasha; Burkhalter, Martin D.; Strom, Christina; Havener, Jody M.; Ramsden, Dale A.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Lineberger Comprehens Canc Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Roberts, Steven A.; Strande, Natasha; Burkhalter, Martin D.; Strom, Christina; Havener, Jody M.; Ramsden, Dale A.] Univ N Carolina, Curriculum Genet & Mol Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Hasty, Paul] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr San Antonio, Inst Biotechnol, San Antonio, TX 78245 USA; [Hasty, Paul] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr San Antonio, Dept Mol Med, San Antonio, TX 78245 USA","Ramsden, DA (reprint author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Lineberger Comprehens Canc Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",dale_ramsden@med.unc.edu,,"Strande, Natasha/0000-0001-5148-9772","Public Health Service (PHS) [CA 84442, R01 CA76317-05A1, P01 AG17242]; Leukemia and Lymphoma Society","We thank M.

As crystals of such large assemblies often diffract weakly (resolution worse than 4 angstrom), we need methods that work at such low resolution. In macromolecular assemblies, some of the components may be known at high resolution, whereas others are unknown: current refinement methods fail as they require a high-resolution starting structure for the entire complex(1). Determining the structure of such complexes, which are often of key biological importance, should be possible in principle as the number of independent diffraction intensities at a resolution better than 5 angstrom generally exceeds the number of degrees of freedom. Here we introduce a method that adds specific information from known homologous structures but allows global and local deformations of these homology models. Our approach uses the observation that local protein structure tends to be conserved as sequence and function evolve. Cross-validation with R(free) ( the free R-factor) determines the optimum deformation and influence of the homology model. For test cases at 3.5-5 angstrom resolution with known structures at high resolution, our method gives significant improvements over conventional refinement in the model as monitored by coordinate accuracy, the definition of secondary structure and the quality of electron density maps. For re-refinements of a representative set of 19 low-resolution crystal structures from the Protein Data Bank, we find similar improvements. Thus, a structure derived from low-resolution diffraction data can have quality similar to a high-resolution structure. Our method is applicable to the study of weakly diffracting crystals using X-ray micro-diffraction(2) as well as data from new X-ray light sources(3). Use of homology information is not restricted to X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy: as optical imaging advances to subnanometre resolution(4,5), it can use similar tools.","[Schroeder, Gunnar F.] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Strukturbiol & Biophys ISB 3, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Schroeder, Gunnar F.; Levitt, Michael; Brunger, Axel T.] Stanford Sch Med, Dept Biol Struct, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Brunger, Axel T.] Stanford Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, James H Clark Ctr E300, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Brunger, Axel T.] Stanford Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Physiol, James H Clark Ctr E300, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Brunger, Axel T.] Stanford Univ, Dept Neurol & Neurol Sci, James H Clark Ctr E300, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Brunger, Axel T.] Stanford Univ, Dept Photon Sci, James H Clark Ctr E300, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Schroder, GF (reprint author), Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Strukturbiol & Biophys ISB 3, D-52425 Julich, Germany.",gu.schroeder@fz-juelich.de; brunger@stanford.edu,"Levitt, Michael/E-4582-2012; Schroder, Gunnar/H-5261-2013","Levitt, Michael/0000-0002-8414-7397; Schroder, Gunnar/0000-0003-1803-5431; Brunger, Axel/0000-0001-5121-2036","National Science Foundation [CNS-0619926]; National Institutes of Health [PN2 (EY016525), GM63718]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)","We thank P.

The metastasis contained two de novo mutations and a large deletion not present in the primary tumour, and was significantly enriched for 20 shared mutations. The xenograft retained all primary tumour mutations and displayed a mutation enrichment pattern that resembled the metastasis.

Infrared signals are initially received by the pit organ, a highly specialized facial structure that is innervated by nerve fibres of the somatosensory system. How this organ detects and transduces infrared signals into nerve impulses is not known. Here we use an unbiased transcriptional profiling approach to identify TRPA1 channels as infrared receptors on sensory nerve fibres that innervate the pit organ. TRPA1 orthologues from pit-bearing snakes (vipers, pythons and boas) are the most heat-sensitive vertebrate ion channels thus far identified, consistent with their role as primary transducers of infrared stimuli. Thus, snakes detect infrared signals through a mechanism involving radiant heating of the pit organ, rather than photochemical transduction. These findings illustrate the broad evolutionary tuning of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels as thermosensors in the vertebrate nervous system.","[Gracheva, Elena O.; Kelly, Yvonne M.; Cordero-Morales, Julio F.; Hollopeter, Gunther; Chesler, Alexander T.; Julius, David] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Physiol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Ingolia, Nicholas T.; Weissman, Jonathan S.; Julius, David] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Cellular & Mol Pharmacol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Ingolia, Nicholas T.; Weissman, Jonathan S.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Ingolia, Nicholas T.; Weissman, Jonathan S.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Calif Inst Quantitat Biosci, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Sanchez, Elda E.; Perez, John C.] Texas A&M Univ, Nat Toxins Res Ctr, Kingsville, TX 78363 USA","Julius, D (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Physiol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA.",julius@cmp.ucsf.edu,,,"Ruth L.

Here we use zero-mode waveguides (ZMWs) and sophisticated detection instrumentation to allow real-time observation of translation at physiologically relevant micromolar ligand concentrations. Translation at each codon is monitored by stable binding of transfer RNAs (tRNAs)-labelled with distinct fluorophores-to translating ribosomes, which allows direct detection of the identity of tRNA molecules bound to the ribosome and therefore the underlying messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence. We observe the transit of tRNAs on single translating ribosomes and determine the number of tRNA molecules simultaneously bound to the ribosome, at each codon of an mRNA molecule. Our results show that ribosomes are only briefly occupied by two tRNA molecules and that release of deacylated tRNA from the exit (E) site is uncoupled from binding of aminoacyl-tRNA site (A-site) tRNA and occurs rapidly after translocation. The methods outlined here have broad application to the study of mRNA sequences, and the mechanism and regulation of translation.","[Uemura, Sotaro; Aitken, Colin Echeverria; Puglisi, Joseph D.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Struct, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Uemura, Sotaro] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; [Aitken, Colin Echeverria; Puglisi, Joseph D.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Biophys Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Korlach, Jonas; Flusberg, Benjamin A.; Turner, Stephen W.] Pacific Biosci Inc, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA","Puglisi, JD (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Struct, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",puglisi@stanford.edu,,,National Institutes of Health [GM51266],"This work was supported by National Institutes of Health grant GM51266 (to J.

Bright scattered starlight limits high-contrast imaging to large angular offsets, currently of the order of ten diffraction beamwidths, 10 lambda/D, of the star (where lambda is the wavelength and D is the aperture diameter(1-5)). Imaging faint planets at smaller angles calls for reducing the starlight and associated photon and speckle noise before detection, while efficiently transmitting nearby planet light. To carry out initial demonstrations of reduced-angle high-contrast coronagraphy, we installed a vortex coronagraph(6-9) capable of reaching small angles behind a small, well-corrected telescope subaperture that provides low levels of scattered starlight(10,11). Here we report the detection of all three HR8799 planets with the resultant small-aperture (1.5 m) system, for which only 2 lambda/D separate the innermost planet from the star, with a final noise level within a factor of two of that given by photon statistics. Similar well-corrected small-angle coronagraphs should thus be able to detect exoplanets located even closer to their host stars with larger ground-based telescopes(12-15), and also allow a reduction in the size of potential space telescopes aimed at the imaging of very faint terrestrial planets.","[Serabyn, E.; Mawet, D.; Burruss, R.] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA","Serabyn, E (reprint author), CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, 4800 Oak Grove Dr, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA.",gene.serabyn@jpl.nasa.gov,,,,,,23,129,132,2,16,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Apr,2010,464,7291,,,,,1018,1020,,10.1038/nature09007,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,582XW,WOS:000276635000033,20393557.0,No,,,11/20/17,r.,burruss,na,na,na,na,na

Random numbers, however, are difficult to characterize mathematically(1), and their generation must rely on an unpredictable physical process(2-6). Inaccuracies in the theoretical modelling of such processes or failures of the devices, possibly due to adversarial attacks, limit the reliability of random number generators in ways that are difficult to control and detect. Here, inspired by earlier work on non-locality-based(7-9) and device-independent(10-14) quantum information processing, we show that the non-local correlations of entangled quantum particles can be used to certify the presence of genuine randomness. It is thereby possible to design a cryptographically secure random number generator that does not require any assumption about the internal working of the device. Such a strong form of randomness generation is impossible classically and possible in quantum systems only if certified by a Bell inequality violation(15). We carry out a proof-of-concept demonstration of this proposal in a system of two entangled atoms separated by approximately one metre. The observed Bell inequality violation, featuring near perfect detection efficiency, guarantees that 42 new random numbers are generated with 99 per cent confidence. Our results lay the groundwork for future device-independent quantum information experiments and for addressing fundamental issues raised by the intrinsic randomness of quantum theory.","[Acin, A.] ICREA, Barcelona 08010, Spain; [Acin, A.] ICFO, Barcelona 08860, Spain; [Pironio, S.; Massar, S.] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Lab Informat Quant, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Pironio, S.] Univ Geneva, Appl Phys Grp, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [de la Giroday, A.

Modern systems are coupled together(15-19) and therefore should be modelled as interdependent networks. A fundamental property of interdependent networks is that failure of nodes in one network may lead to failure of dependent nodes in other networks. This may happen recursively and can lead to a cascade of failures. In fact, a failure of a very small fraction of nodes in one network may lead to the complete fragmentation of a system of several interdependent networks. A dramatic real-world example of a cascade of failures ('concurrent malfunction') is the electrical blackout that affected much of Italy on 28 September 2003: the shutdown of power stations directly led to the failure of nodes in the Internet communication network, which in turn caused further breakdown of power stations(20). Here we develop a framework for understanding the robustness of interacting networks subject to such cascading failures. We present exact analytical solutions for the critical fraction of nodes that, on removal, will lead to a failure cascade and to a complete fragmentation of two interdependent networks. Surprisingly, a broader degree distribution increases the vulnerability of interdependent networks to random failure, which is opposite to how a single network behaves. Our findings highlight the need to consider interdependent network properties in designing robust networks.","[Buldyrev, Sergey V.] Yeshiva Univ, Dept Phys, New York, NY 10033 USA; [Buldyrev, Sergey V.; Paul, Gerald; Stanley, H.

A recent study combining oxygen and hydrogen isotope compositions of cherts, however, makes a case for Archaean ocean temperatures being no greater than 40 degrees C (ref. 5). Ocean temperature can also be assessed using the oxygen isotope composition of phosphate. Recent studies show that (18)O:(16)O ratios of dissolved inorganic phosphate (delta(18)O(P)) reflect ambient seawater temperature as well as biological processing that dominates marine phosphorus cycling at low temperature(6,7). All forms of life require and concentrate phosphorus, and as a result of biological processing, modern marine phosphates have delta(18)O(P) values typically between 19-26 parts per thousand (VSMOW)(7,8), highly evolved from presumed source values of similar to 6-8 parts per thousand that are characteristic of apatite in igneous rocks(9,10) and meteorites(11). Here we report oxygen isotope compositions of phosphates in sediments from the 3.2-3.5-billion-year-old Barberton Greenstone Belt in South Africa. We find that delta(18)O(P) values range from 9.3 parts per thousand to 19.9 parts per thousand and include the highest values reported for Archaean rocks. The temperatures calculated from our highest delta(18)O(P) values and assuming equilibrium with sea water with delta(18)O=0% (ref. 12) range from 26 degrees C to 35 degrees C. The higher delta(18)O(P) values are similar to those of modern marine phosphate and suggest a well-developed phosphorus cycle and evolved biologic activity on the Archaean Earth.","[Blake, Ruth E.; Chang, Sae Jung] Yale Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Lepland, Aivo] Geol Survey Norway, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Lepland, Aivo] Tallinn Univ Technol, Inst Geol, EE-19086 Tallinn, Estonia","Blake, RE (reprint author), Yale Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, POB 6666, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",ruth.blake@yale.edu,,,,,,37,67,73,5,77,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Apr,2010,464,7291,,,,,1029,U89,,10.1038/nature08952,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,582XW,WOS:000276635000036,20393560.0,No,,,11/20/17,aivo,lepland,na,na,na,na,na

The hypogeous fruiting body of T. melanosporum is a gastronomic delicacy produced by an ectomycorrhizal symbiont(3) endemic to calcareous soils in southern Europe. The worldwide demand for this truffle has fuelled intense efforts at cultivation. Identification of processes that condition and trigger fruit body and symbiosis formation, ultimately leading to efficient crop production, will be facilitated by a thorough analysis of truffle genomic traits. In the ectomycorrhizal Laccaria bicolor, the expansion of gene families may have acted as a 'symbiosis toolbox'(4). This feature may however reflect evolution of this particular taxon and not a general trait shared by all ectomycorrhizal species(5). To get a better understanding of the biology and evolution of the ectomycorrhizal symbiosis, we report here the sequence of the haploid genome of T. melanosporum, which at similar to 125 megabases is the largest and most complex fungal genome sequenced so far. This expansion results from a proliferation of transposable elements accounting for similar to 58% of the genome. In contrast, this genome only contains similar to 7,500 protein-coding genes with very rare multigene families. It lacks large sets of carbohydrate cleaving enzymes, but a few of them involved in degradation of plant cell walls are induced in symbiotic tissues. The latter feature and the upregulation of genes encoding for lipases and multicopper oxidases suggest that T. melanosporum degrades its host cell walls during colonization. Symbiosis induces an increased expression of carbohydrate and amino acid transporters in both L. bicolor and T. melanosporum, but the comparison of genomic traits in the two ectomycorrhizal fungi showed that genetic predispositions for symbiosis-'the symbiosis toolbox'-evolved along different ways in ascomycetes and basidiomycetes.","[Martin, Francis; Kohler, Annegret; Murat, Claude; Morin, Emmanuelle; Brun, Annick; Buee, Marc; Duplessis, Sebastien; Marcais, Benoit; Tisserant, Emilie] Nancy Univ, UMR 1136, INRA, F-54280 Champenoux, France; [Balestrini, Raffaella; Ghignone, Stefano; Mello, Antonietta; Zampieri, Elisa; Bonfante, Paola] Univ Turin, Dipartimento Biol Vegetale, I-10125 Turin, Italy; [Balestrini, Raffaella; Ghignone, Stefano; Mello, Antonietta; Zampieri, Elisa; Bonfante, Paola] Univ Turin, CNR, Ist Protez Piante, Sez Torino, I-10125 Turin, Italy; [Coutinho, Pedro M.; Cantarel, Brandi; Henrissat, Bernard] Univ Aix Marseille 1, CNRS, UMR6098, F-13288 Marseille, France; [Coutinho, Pedro M.; Cantarel, Brandi; Henrissat, Bernard] Univ Aix Marseille 2, CNRS, UMR6098, F-13288 Marseille, France; [Jaillon, Olivier; Noel, Benjamin; Porcel, Bettina; Anthouard, Veronique; Artiguenave, Francois; Aury, Jean-Marc; Couloux, Arnaud; Da Silva, Corinne; Denoeud, France; Wincker, Patrick] CEA, IG, F-91057 Evry, France; [Jaillon, Olivier; Noel, Benjamin; Porcel, Bettina; Anthouard, Veronique; Artiguenave, Francois; Aury, Jean-Marc; Couloux, Arnaud; Da Silva, Corinne; Denoeud, France; Wincker, Patrick] CNRS, UMR 8030, F-91057 Evry, France; [Jaillon, Olivier; Noel, Benjamin; Porcel, Bettina; Anthouard, Veronique; Artiguenave, Francois; Aury, Jean-Marc; Couloux, Arnaud; Da Silva, Corinne; Denoeud, France; Wincker, Patrick] Univ Evry, F-91057 Evry, France; [Montanini, Barbara; Percudani, Riccardo; Bolchi, Angelo; Ruotolo, Roberta; Viscomi, Arturo Roberto; Ottonello, Simone] Univ Parma, Dipartmento Biochim & Biol Mol, I-43100 Parma, Italy; [Rubini, Andrea; Arcioni, Sergio; Riccioni, Claudia; Paolocci, Francesco] CNR, IGV, Unita Organizzat Supporto Perugia, I-06128 Perugia, Italy; [Amicucci, Antonella] Univ Urbino, Dipartimento Sci Biomol, I-61029 Urbino, PU, Italy; [Amselem, Joelle; Hilselberger, Benoit; Quesneville, Hadi] INRA, Unite Rech Genom Info, F-78000 Versailles, France; [Ballario, Paola; Brenna, Andrea] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Genet & Biol Mol, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Ballario, Paola; Brenna, Andrea] Univ Roma La Sapienza, CNR, IBPM, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Chevalier, Gerard] Univ Clermont Ferrand, INRA Clermont Theix, INRA, UMR Ameliorat & Sante Plantes, F-63122 St Genes Champanelle, France; [Iotti, Mirco; Zambonelli, Alessandra] Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Protez Valorizzaz Agroalimentare, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Miranda, Michele] Univ Aquila, Dipartimento Biol Base & Applicata, I-67100 Laquila, Italy; [Pacioni, Giovanni] Univ Aquila, Dipartimento Sci Ambientali, I-67100 Laquila, Italy; [Splivallo, Richard] Univ Gottingen, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Lebrun, Marc-Henri] INRA Grignon, INRA, UMR BIOGER CPP, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France","Martin, F (reprint author), Nancy Univ, UMR 1136, INRA, F-54280 Champenoux, France.",fmartin@nancy.inra.fr,"; Balestrini, Raffaella/D-1975-2010; DUPLESSIS, SEBASTIEN/G-4150-2011; Zampieri, Elisa/G-6516-2011; percudani, riccardo/B-4872-2011; Henrissat, Bernard/J-2475-2012; Mello, Antonietta/B-9101-2015; Ghignone, Stefano/B-8288-2008; Iotti, Mirco/M-1750-2015; Balestrini, Raffaella/Q-1106-2015; Pacioni, Giovanni/O-7646-2015","Murat, Claude/0000-0003-0685-7307; Montanini, Barbara/0000-0002-5419-7975; ZAMPIERI, Elisa/0000-0003-4623-1747; Paolocci, Francesco/0000-0002-9394-876X; Bonfante, Paola/0000-0003-3576-8530; AURY, Jean-Marc/0000-0003-1718-3010; DUPLESSIS, SEBASTIEN/0000-0002-2072-2989; Mello, Antonietta/0000-0002-6311-377X; Ghignone, Stefano/0000-0002-2033-2286; Iotti, Mirco/0000-0003-2705-0385; Balestrini, Raffaella/0000-0001-7958-7681; Pacioni, Giovanni/0000-0002-0201-5789; Percudani, Riccardo/0000-0001-8452-1062; riccioni, claudia/0000-0003-1069-8943; LEBRUN, marc-henri/0000-0003-1562-1902","Genoscope, Institut de Genomique, CEA; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR); European FP6 Network of Excellence EVOLTREE, Region Lorraine; Fondazione Cariparma, Compagnia di San Paolo-Torino; Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research (MIUR), Regione Umbria; Instituto Pasteur Fondazione Cenci Bolognetti","We thank the late L.

Studies in both humans and model organisms, such as yeast, have failed to detect a large fraction of the loci that underlie such complex traits(2,3). A lack of statistical power to identify multiple loci with small effects is undoubtedly one of the primary reasons for this problem. We have developed a method in yeast that allows the use of much larger sample sizes than previously possible and hence permits the detection of multiple loci with small effects. The method involves generating very large numbers of progeny from a cross between two Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains and then phenotyping and genotyping pools of these offspring. We applied the method to 17 chemical resistance traits and mitochondrial function, and identified loci for each of these phenotypes. We show that the level of genetic complexity underlying these quantitative traits is highly variable, with some traits influenced by one major locus and others by at least 20 loci. Our results provide an empirical demonstration of the genetic complexity of a number of traits and show that it is possible to identify many of the underlying factors using straightforward techniques. Our method should have broad applications in yeast and can be extended to other organisms.","[Ehrenreich, Ian M.; Torabi, Noorossadat; Jia, Yue; Kent, Jonathan; Martis, Stephen; Shapiro, Joshua A.; Gresham, David; Caudy, Amy A.; Kruglyak, Leonid] Princeton Univ, Lewis Sigler Inst Integrat Genom, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Ehrenreich, Ian M.; Shapiro, Joshua A.; Kruglyak, Leonid] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Ehrenreich, Ian M.; Jia, Yue; Shapiro, Joshua A.; Kruglyak, Leonid] Princeton Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Torabi, Noorossadat] Princeton Univ, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA","Kruglyak, L (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Lewis Sigler Inst Integrat Genom, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.",leonid@genomics.princeton.edu,,"Caudy, Amy/0000-0001-6307-8137; Shapiro, Joshua/0000-0002-6224-0347","NIH [R37 MH59520, F32 HG51762, P50 GM071508]; James S.

Using genetic linkage analysis, we mapped a new locus for the disease to chromosome 18p11.22, and identified a mutation (Leu9Arg) in the adenomatosis polyposis down-regulated 1 (APCDD1) gene in three families. We show that APCDD1 is a membrane-bound glycoprotein that is abundantly expressed in human hair follicles, and can interact in vitro with WNT3A and LRP5-two essential components of Wnt signalling. Functional studies show that APCDD1 inhibits Wnt signalling in a cell-autonomous manner and functions upstream of beta-catenin. Moreover, APCDD1 represses activation of Wnt reporters and target genes, and inhibits the biological effects of Wnt signalling during both the generation of neurons from progenitors in the developing chick nervous system, and axis specification in Xenopus laevis embryos. The mutation Leu9Arg is located in the signal peptide of APCDD1, and perturbs its translational processing from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane. APCDD1(L9R) probably functions in a dominant-negative manner to inhibit the stability and membrane localization of the wild-type protein. These findings describe a novel inhibitor of the Wnt signalling pathway with an essential role in human hair growth. As APCDD1 is expressed in a broad repertoire of cell types(3), our findings indicate that APCDD1 may regulate a diversity of biological processes controlled by Wnt signalling.","[Shimomura, Yutaka; Luria, Victor; Wajid, Muhammad; Petukhova, Lynn; Christiano, Angela M.] Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Dermatol, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Luria, Victor; Christiano, Angela M.] Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Genet & Dev, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Agalliu, Dritan; Barres, Ben A.] Stanford Univ, Dept Neurobiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Vonica, Alin; Brivanlou, Ali H.] Rockefeller Univ, Lab Vertebrate Embryol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Baumer, Alessandra; Schinzel, Albert] Univ Zurich, Inst Med Genet, CH-8603 Schwerzenbach, Switzerland; [Belli, Serena] Struttura Semplice Genet Med APSS, I-138100 Trento, Italy","Christiano, AM (reprint author), Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Dermatol, 630 W 168th St,VC15 204A, New York, NY 10032 USA.",amc65@columbia.edu,"Wajid, Muhammad/F-5087-2015",,"USPHS NIH, NIH/NIAMS [R01AR44924]; Dermatology Foundation; Myelin Repair Foundation; National Multiple Sclerosis Society [RG 3936A7/1]; NIH [R01 HD032105, R03HD057334]","We are grateful to the family members for their participation in this study, and to H.

However, regulatory molecules that coordinate the biogenesis of primary cilia with other cellular processes, including cytoskeletal organization, vesicle trafficking and cell-cell adhesion, remain to be identified. Here we report the results of a functional genomic screen using RNA interference (RNAi) to identify human genes involved in ciliogenesis control. The screen identified 36 positive and 13 negative ciliogenesis modulators, which include molecules involved in actin dynamics and vesicle trafficking. Further investigation demonstrated that blocking actin assembly facilitates ciliogenesis by stabilizing the pericentrosomal preciliary compartment (PPC), a previously uncharacterized compact vesiculotubular structure storing transmembrane proteins destined for cilia during the early phase of ciliogenesis. The PPC was labelled by recycling endosome markers. Moreover, knockdown of modulators that are involved in the endocytic recycling pathway affected the formation of the PPC as well as ciliogenesis. Our results uncover a critical regulatory step that couples actin dynamics and endocytic recycling with ciliogenesis, and also provides potential target molecules for future study.","[Kim, Joon; Lee, Ji Eun; Gleeson, Joseph G.] Univ Calif San Diego, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Neurosci, Inst Genom Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Kim, Joon; Lee, Ji Eun; Gleeson, Joseph G.] Univ Calif San Diego, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Pediat, Inst Genom Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Heynen-Genel, Susanne; Suyama, Eigo; Aza-Blanc, Pedro] Sanford Burnham Med Res Inst, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Ono, Keiichiro; Lee, KiYoung; Ideker, Trey] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Ono, Keiichiro; Lee, KiYoung; Ideker, Trey] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Bioengn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Lee, KiYoung] Ajou Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biomed Informat, Suwon 443749, South Korea","Gleeson, JG (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Neurosci, Inst Genom Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",jogleeson@ucsd.edu,"Kim, Joon/C-1833-2011",,"UCSD Microscopy Core [P30 NS047101, P30 CA23100]; NARSAD; NINDS [RO1 NS052455]; NIH [GM070743]; Korea Food and Drug Administration [10182KFDA992]; Brain Research Center [M103KV010008-07K2201-00810]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute","The screen was performed at the Functional Genomics Core (LJINCC grant P30 NS057096 to S.

Ligand binding triggers a conformational change in the receptor negative regulatory region (NRR) that enables ADAM protease cleavage(3,4) at a juxtamembrane site that otherwise lies buried within the quiescent NRR(5,6). Subsequent intramembrane proteolysis catalysed by the c-secretase complex liberates the intracellular domain (ICD) to initiate the downstream Notch transcriptional program. Aberrant signalling through each receptor has been linked to numerous diseases, particularly cancer(7), making the Notch pathway a compelling target for new drugs. Although gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) have progressed into the clinic(8), GSIs fail to distinguish individual Notch receptors, inhibit other signalling pathways(9) and cause intestinal toxicity(10), attributed to dual inhibition of Notch1 and 2 (ref. 11). To elucidate the discrete functions of Notch1 and Notch2 and develop clinically relevant inhibitors that reduce intestinal toxicity, we used phage display technology to generate highly specialized antibodies that specifically antagonize each receptor paralogue and yet cross-react with the human and mouse sequences, enabling the discrimination of Notch1 versus Notch2 function in human patients and rodent models. Our co-crystal structure shows that the inhibitory mechanism relies on stabilizing NRR quiescence. Selective blocking of Notch1 inhibits tumour growth in pre-clinical models through two mechanisms: inhibition of cancer cell growth and deregulation of angiogenesis. Whereas inhibition of Notch1 plus Notch2 causes severe intestinal toxicity, inhibition of either receptor alone reduces or avoids this effect, demonstrating a clear advantage over pan-Notch inhibitors. Our studies emphasize the value of paralogue-specific antagonists in dissecting the contributions of distinct Notch receptors to differentiation and disease and reveal the therapeutic promise in targeting Notch1 and Notch2 independently.","[Cain-Hom, Carol; Choy, Lisa; Hagenbeek, Thijs J.; Dow, Graham J.; Shelton, Amy; Siebel, Christian W.] Genentech Inc, Dept Mol Biol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Wu, Yan; Chen, Yongmei; Stawicki, Scott] Genentech Inc, Dept Antibody Engn, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Zha, Jiping; Callahan, Christopher A.] Genentech Inc, Dept Pathol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Finkle, David; Venook, Rayna] Genentech Inc, Dept Translat Oncol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Wu, Xiumin; Ridgway, John; Yan, Minhong] Genentech Inc, Dept Tumor Biol & Angiogenesis, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Schahin-Reed, Dorreyah; Watts, Ryan J.] Genentech Inc, Dept Neurodegenerat, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [de Leon, Gladys P.; Hymowitz, Sarah G.] Genentech Inc, Dept Biol Struct, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Zhang, Jeff; Choy, Robert; Howard, Peter; Kadyk, Lisa] Exelixis Inc, San Francisco, CA 94083 USA","Siebel, CW (reprint author), Genentech Inc, Dept Mol Biol, 1 DNA Way, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA.",csiebel@gene.com,,,"Department of Energy, National Institutes of Health; National Institute of General Medical Sciences","We acknowledge the Notch scientists at Genentech and Exelixis for support throughout this project.

It holds promise for overcoming problems associated with the treatment of late-stage cancers. However, the broad application of chemoprevention is compromised at present by limited effectiveness and potential toxicity. To overcome these challenges, here we developed a new chemoprevention approach that specifically targets premalignant tumour cells for apoptosis. We show that a deficiency in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene and subsequent activation of beta-catenin lead to the repression of cellular caspase-8 inhibitor c-FLIP (also known as CFLAR) expression through activation of c-Myc, and that all-trans-retinyl acetate (RAc) independently upregulates tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) death receptors and suppresses decoy receptors. Thus, the combination of TRAIL and RAc induces apoptosis in APC-deficient premalignant cells without affecting normal cells in vitro. In addition, we show that short-term and non-continuous TRAIL and RAc treatment induce apoptosis specifically in intestinal polyps, strongly inhibit tumour growth, and prolong survival in multiple intestinal neoplasms C57BL/6J-Apc(Min)/J (Apc(Min)) mice. With our approach, we further demonstrate that TRAIL and RAc induce significant cell death in human colon polyps, providing a potentially selective approach for colorectal cancer chemoprevention by targeting APC-deficient cells for apoptosis.","[Zhang, Ling; Ren, Xiaoyang; Huang, Shaoyi; Xu, Zhengming; Wen, Xian-Feng; Wu, Xiangwei] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Head & Neck Surg, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Alt, Eckhard; Bai, Xiaowen] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Mol Pathol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Lynch, Patrick M.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Gastroenterol Hepatol & Nutr, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Wu, Xiangwei] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Mol & Cellular Oncol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Moyer, Mary P.] INCELL Corp, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA","Wu, XW (reprint author), Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Head & Neck Surg, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",xwwu@mdanderson.org,,,NIH [AI063063]; M.

Long, double-stranded RNAs were first shown to mediate RNAi in Caenorhabditis elegans(3), and the potential use of RNAi for human therapy has been demonstrated by the finding that small interfering RNAs (siRNAs; approximately 21-base-pair double-stranded RNA) can elicit RNAi in mammalian cells without producing an interferon response(4). We are at present conducting the first in-human phase I clinical trial involving the systemic administration of siRNA to patients with solid cancers using a targeted, nanoparticle delivery system. Here we provide evidence of inducing an RNAi mechanism of action in a human from the delivered siRNA. Tumour biopsies from melanoma patients obtained after treatment show the presence of intracellularly localized nanoparticles in amounts that correlate with dose levels of the nanoparticles administered (this is, to our knowledge, a first for systemically delivered nanoparticles of any kind). Furthermore, a reduction was found in both the specific messenger RNA (M2 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase (RRM2)) and the protein (RRM2) levels when compared to pre-dosing tissue. Most notably, we detect the presence of an mRNA fragment that demonstrates that siRNA-mediated mRNA cleavage occurs specifically at the site predicted for an RNAi mechanism from a patient who received the highest dose of the nanoparticles. Together, these data demonstrate that siRNA administered systemically to a human can produce a specific gene inhibition (reduction in mRNA and protein) by an RNAi mechanism of action.","[Davis, Mark E.; Zuckerman, Jonathan E.; Choi, Chung Hang J.; Alabi, Christopher A.] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Seligson, David; Ribas, Antoni] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Jonsson Comprehens Canc Ctr, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Seligson, David] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Ribas, Antoni] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Hematol Oncol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Tolcher, Anthony] START LLC, San Antonio, TX 78229 USA; [Yen, Yun] City Hope Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dept Med Oncol & Therapeut Res, Duarte, CA 91010 USA; [Heidel, Jeremy D.] Calando Pharmaceut, Pasadena, CA 91101 USA","Davis, ME (reprint author), CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",mdavis@cheme.caltech.edu,,,National Cancer Institute [CA U54 119347]; Daljit S. & Elaine Sarkaria Biomarker Laboratory Fund,"We thank H.

Recent studies of dosage compensation, imprinting, and homeotic gene expression suggest that individual lincRNAs can function as the interface between DNA and specific chromatin remodelling activities(6-8). Here we show that lincRNAs in the HOX loci become systematically dys-regulated during breast cancer progression. The lincRNA termed HOTAIR is increased in expression in primary breast tumours and metastases, and HOTAIR expression level in primary tumours is a powerful predictor of eventual metastasis and death. Enforced expression of HOTAIR in epithelial cancer cells induced genome-wide re-targeting of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) to an occupancy pattern more resembling embryonic fibroblasts, leading to altered histone H3 lysine 27 methylation, gene expression, and increased cancer invasiveness and metastasis in a manner dependent on PRC2. Conversely, loss of HOTAIR can inhibit cancer invasiveness, particularly in cells that possess excessive PRC2 activity. These findings indicate that lincRNAs have active roles in modulating the cancer epigenome and may be important targets for cancer diagnosis and therapy.","[Gupta, Rajnish A.; Wang, Kevin C.; Wong, David J.; Tsai, Miao-Chih; Hung, Tiffany; Chang, Howard Y.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Gupta, Rajnish A.; Wang, Kevin C.; Wong, David J.; Tsai, Miao-Chih; Hung, Tiffany; Chang, Howard Y.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Program Epithelial Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kim, Jeewon] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Stanford Canc Ctr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kim, Jeewon] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Transgenic Mouse Res Ctr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Li, Rui; West, Robert B.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Shah, Nilay; Sukumar, Saraswati] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Sidney Kimmel Comprehens Canc Ctr, Baltimore, MD 21231 USA; [Argani, Pedram] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Baltimore, MD 21231 USA; [Horlings, Hugo M.; van de Vijver, Marc J.] Univ Amsterdam, Acad Med Ctr, Dept Pathol, NL-1105 AZ Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Rinn, John L.] Harvard Univ, Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Rinn, John L.] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Wang, Yulei; Brzoska, Pius; Kong, Benjamin] Appl Biosyst Inc, Foster City, CA 94404 USA","Chang, HY (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",howchang@stanford.edu,"__, _/H-3399-2011; Shah, Nilay/H-9988-2013","Shah, Nilay/0000-0002-8906-6844",National Institutes of Health (NIH); Emerald Foundation; American Cancer Society; Dermatology Foundation; Susan Komen Foundation; NSF; Department of Defense BCRP; Howard Hughes Medical Institute,"We thank Y.

They live at high temperatures in volcanic habitats at the expense of inorganic substances, often under anoxic conditions(1). These autotrophic organisms use diverse carbon dioxide fixation mechanisms generating acetyl-coenzyme A, from which gluconeogenesis must start(2-4). Here we show that virtually all archaeal groups as well as the deeply branching bacterial lineages contain a bifunctional fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) aldolase/phosphatase with both FBP aldolase and FBP phosphatase activity. This enzyme is missing inmost other Bacteria and in Eukaryota, and is heat-stabile even in mesophilic marine Crenarchaeota. Its bifunctionality ensures that heat-labile triosephosphates are quickly removed and trapped in stabile fructose 6-phosphate, rendering gluconeogenesis unidirectional. We propose that this highly conserved, heat-stabile and bifunctional FBP aldolase/phosphatase represents the pacemaking ancestral gluconeogenic enzyme, and that in evolution gluconeogenesis preceded glycolysis(5).","[Say, Rafael F.; Fuchs, Georg] Univ Freiburg, Fak Biol, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany","Fuchs, G (reprint author), Univ Freiburg, Fak Biol, Schanzlestr 1, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany.",georg.fuchs@biologie.uni-freiburg.de,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Evonik-Degussa,"We thank R.

Most human gene promoters are embedded within CGIs that lack DNA methylation and coincide with sites of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3), irrespective of transcriptional activity(3,4). In spite of these intriguing correlations, the functional significance of non-methylated CGI sequences with respect to chromatin structure and transcription is unknown. By performing a search for proteins that are common to all CGIs, here we show high enrichment for Cfp1, which selectively binds to nonmethylated CpGs in vitro(5,6). Chromatin immunoprecipitation of a mono-allelically methylated CGI confirmed that Cfp1 specifically associates with non-methylated CpG sites in vivo. High throughput sequencing of Cfp1-bound chromatin identified a notable concordance with non-methylated CGIs and sites of H3K4me3 in the mouse brain. Levels of H3K4me3 at CGIs were markedly reduced in Cfp1-depleted cells, consistent with the finding that Cfp1 associates with the H3K4 methyltransferase Setd1 (refs 7, 8). To test whether non-methylated CpG-dense sequences are sufficient to establish domains of H3K4me3, we analysed artificial CpG clusters that were integrated into the mouse genome. Despite the absence of promoters, the insertions recruited Cfp1 and created new peaks of H3K4me3. The data indicate that a primary function of non-methylated CGIs is to genetically influence the local chromatin modification state by interaction with Cfp1 and perhaps other CpG-binding proteins.","[Thomson, John P.; Skene, Peter J.; Selfridge, Jim; Clouaire, Thomas; Guy, Jacky; Webb, Shaun; Kerr, Alastair R.

A notable exception to this behaviour is the case of quantum spin liquids, in which quantum fluctuations prevent a transition to an ordered state down to the lowest temperatures. There have now been tentative observations of such states in some two-dimensional organic compounds, yet quantum spin liquids remain elusive in microscopic two-dimensional models that are relevant to experiments. Here we show, by means of large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations of correlated fermions on a honeycomb lattice (a structure realized in, for example, graphene), that a quantum spin liquid emerges between the state described by massless Dirac fermions and an antiferromagnetically ordered Mott insulator. This unexpected quantum-disordered state is found to be a short-range resonating valence-bond liquid, akin to the one proposed for high-temperature superconductors: the possibility of unconventional superconductivity through doping therefore arises in our system. We foresee the experimental realization of this model system using ultra-cold atoms, or group IV elements arranged in honeycomb lattices.","[Meng, Z.

By examining how mesenchymal osteolineage cells modulate haematopoiesis, here we show that deletion of Dicer1 specifically in mouse osteoprogenitors, but not in mature osteoblasts, disrupts the integrity of haematopoiesis. Myelodysplasia resulted and acute myelogenous leukaemia emerged that had acquired several genetic abnormalities while having intact Dicer1. Examining gene expression altered in osteoprogenitors as a result of Dicer1 deletion showed reduced expression of Sbds, the gene mutated in Schwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome-a human bone marrow failure and leukaemia pre-disposition condition. Deletion of Sbds in mouse osteoprogenitors induced bone marrow dysfunction with myelodysplasia. Therefore, perturbation of specific mesenchymal subsets of stromal cells can disorder differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis of heterologous cells, and disrupt tissue homeostasis. Furthermore, primary stromal dysfunction can result in secondary neoplastic disease, supporting the concept of niche-induced oncogenesis.","[Raaijmakers, Marc H. G.

However, the genes contributing to this stability remain obscure. We previously identified Zscan4 as a specific marker for two-cell embryo and ES cells. Here we show that Zscan4 is involved in telomere maintenance and long-term genomic stability in ES cells. Only 5% of ES cells express Zscan4 at a given time, but nearly all ES cells activate Zscan4 at least once during nine passages. The transient Zscan4-positive state is associated with rapid telomere extension by telomere recombination and upregulation of meiosis-specific homologous recombination genes, which encode proteins that are colocalized with ZSCAN4 on telomeres. Furthermore, Zscan4 knockdown shortens telomeres, increases karyotype abnormalities and spontaneous sister chromatid exchange, and slows down cell proliferation until reaching crisis by passage eight. Together, our data show a unique mode of genome maintenance in ES cells.","[Zalzman, Michal; Falco, Geppino; Sharova, Lioudmila V.; Nishiyama, Akira; Thomas, Marshall; Lee, Sung-Lim; Stagg, Carole A.; Hoang, Hien G.; Yang, Hsih-Te; Ko, Minoru S.

Multivesicular bodies are formed when cargo-rich patches of the limiting membrane of endosomes bud inwards by an unknown mechanism and are then cleaved to yield cargo-bearing intralumenal vesicles. The biogenesis of multivesicular bodies was reconstituted and visualized using giant unilamellar vesicles, fluorescent ESCRT-0, -I, -II and -III complexes, and a membrane-tethered fluorescent ubiquitin fusion as a model cargo. Here we show that ESCRT-0 forms domains of clustered cargo but does not deform membranes. ESCRT-I and ESCRT-II in combination deform the membrane into buds, in which cargo is confined. ESCRT-I and ESCRT-II localize to the bud necks, and recruit ESCRT-0-ubiquitin domains to the buds. ESCRT-III subunits localize to the bud neck and efficiently cleave the buds to form intralumenal vesicles. Intralumenal vesicles produced in this reaction contain the model cargo but are devoid of ESCRTs. The observations explain how the ESCRTs direct membrane budding and scission from the cytoplasmic side of the bud without being consumed in the reaction.","[Wollert, Thomas; Hurley, James H.] NIDDK, Mol Biol Lab, NIH, US Dept Hlth & Human Serv, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Hurley, JH (reprint author), NIDDK, Mol Biol Lab, NIH, US Dept Hlth & Human Serv, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",hurley@helix.nih.gov,,"Wollert, Thomas/0000-0001-9732-4789","National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases; Intramural AIDS Targeted Antiviral Program; EMBO","We thank E.

The cause of each 18-month-long eclipse has been a subject of controversy for nearly 190 years(1) because the companion has hitherto been undetectable. The orbital elements imply that the opaque object has roughly the same mass as the visible component, which for much of the last century was thought to be an F-type supergiant star with a mass of similar to 15M(circle dot) (M(circle dot), mass of the Sun). The high mass-to-luminosity ratio of the hidden object was originally explained by supposing it to be a hyperextended infrared star(2) or, later, a black hole(3) with an accretion disk, although the preferred interpretation was as a disk of opaque material(4,5) at a temperature of 500 K, tilted to the line of sight(6,7) and with a central opening(8). Recent work implies that the system consists of a low-mass (2.2M(circle dot)-3.3M(circle dot)) visible F-type star, with a disk at 550K that enshrouds a single B5V-type star(9). Here we report interferometric images that show the eclipsing body moving in front of the F star. The body is an opaque disk and appears tilted as predicted(7). Adopting a mass of 5.9M(circle dot) for the B star, we derive a mass of similar to(3.6 +/- 0.7)M(circle dot) for the F star. The disk mass is dynamically negligible; we estimate it to contain similar to 0.07M(circle plus) (M(circle plus), mass of the Earth) if it consists purely of dust.","[Kloppenborg, Brian; Stencel, Robert] Univ Denver, Dept Phys & Astron, Denver, CO 80208 USA; [Monnier, John D.; Baron, Fabien; Che, Xiao] Univ Michigan, Dept Astron, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Schaefer, Gail; McAlister, Hal; ten Brummelaar, Theo; Farrington, Chris; Sallave-Goldfinger, P.

Recently, ultra-dense resistive memory arrays built from various two-terminal semiconductor or insulator thin film devices have been demonstrated(7-12). Among these, bipolar voltage-actuated switches have been identified as physical realizations of 'memristors' or memristive devices, combining the electrical properties of a memory element and a resistor(13,14). Such devices were first hypothesized by Chua in 1971 (ref. 15), and are characterized by one or more state variables(16) that define the resistance of the switch depending upon its voltage history. Here we show that this family of nonlinear dynamical memory devices can also be used for logic operations: we demonstrate that they can execute material implication (IMP), which is a fundamental Boolean logic operation on two variables p and q such that pIMPq is equivalent to (NOTp)ORq. Incorporated within an appropriate circuit(17,18), memristive switches can thus perform 'stateful' logic operations for which the same devices serve simultaneously as gates (logic) and latches(19) (memory) that use resistance instead of voltage or charge as the physical state variable.","[Borghetti, Julien; Snider, Gregory S.; Kuekes, Philip J.; Yang, J.

For nano-structured materials, in contrast, dislocation multiplication is severely confined by the nanometre-scale geometries so that continued plasticity can be expected to be source-controlled. Nano-grained polycrystalline materials were found to be strong but brittle(5-9), because both nucleation and motion of dislocations are effectively suppressed by the nanoscale crystallites. Here we report a dislocation-nucleation-controlled mechanism in nano-twinned metals(10,11) in which there are plenty of dislocation nucleation sites but dislocation motion is not confined. We show that dislocation nucleation governs the strength of such materials, resulting in their softening below a critical twin thickness. Large-scale molecular dynamics simulations and a kinetic theory of dislocation nucleation in nano-twinned metals show that there exists a transition in deformation mechanism, occurring at a critical twin-boundary spacing for which strength is maximized. At this point, the classical Hall-Petch type of strengthening due to dislocation pile-up and cutting through twin planes switches to a dislocation-nucleation-controlled softening mechanism with twin-boundary migration resulting from nucleation and motion of partial dislocations parallel to the twin planes. Most previous studies(12,13) did not consider a sufficient range of twin thickness and therefore missed this strength-softening regime. The simulations indicate that the critical twin-boundary spacing for the onset of softening in nano-twinned copper and the maximum strength depend on the grain size: the smaller the grain size, the smaller the critical twin-boundary spacing, and the higher the maximum strength of the material.","[Li, Xiaoyan; Gao, Huajian] Brown Univ, Div Engn, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Wei, Yujie] Univ Alabama, Dept Mech Engn, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Lu, Lei; Lu, Ke] Chinese Acad Sci, Shenyang Natl Lab Mat Sci, Inst Met Res, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China","Wei, YJ (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Mech, State Key Lab Nonlinear Mech, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.",yujie_wei@lnm.imech.ac.cn; huajian_gao@brown.edu,"Li, Xiaoyan/B-7325-2008; Gao, Huajian/F-9360-2010; Lu, Lei/E-3864-2012; Wei, Yujie/A-3770-2009","Wei, Yujie/0000-0002-3213-7891","NSF [DMR-0520651]; Brown University [CMMI-0758535]; NSFC [50621091, 50725103, 50890171]; MOST of China [2005CB623604]","X.

Grasslands cover about 20 per cent of the temperate land surface of the Earth and are widely used as pasture. It has been suggested that high animal stocking rates and the resulting elevated nitrogen input increase N2O emissions(4-7). Internationally agreed methods to upscale the effect of increased livestock numbers on N2O emissions are based directly on per capita nitrogen inputs(8). However, measurements of grassland N2O fluxes are often performed over short time periods(9), with low time resolution and mostly during the growing season. In consequence, our understanding of the daily and seasonal dynamics of grassland N2O fluxes remains limited. Here we report year-round N2O flux measurements with high and low temporal resolution at ten steppe grassland sites in Inner Mongolia, China. We show that short-lived pulses of N2O emission during spring thaw dominate the annual N2O budget at our study sites. The N2O emission pulses are highest in ungrazed steppe and decrease with increasing stocking rate, suggesting that grazing decreases rather than increases N2O emissions. Our results show that the stimulatory effect of higher stocking rates on nitrogen cycling(4,7) and, hence, on N2O emission is more than offset by the effects of a parallel reduction in microbial biomass, inorganic nitrogen production and wintertime water retention. By neglecting these freeze-thaw interactions, existing approaches may have systematically overestimated N2O emissions over the last century for semi-arid, cool temperate grasslands by up to 72 per cent.","[Wolf, Benjamin; Brueggemann, Nicolas; Dannenmann, Michael; Butterbach-Bahl, Klaus] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, D-82467 Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany; [Zheng, Xunhua; Chen, Weiwei; Yao, Zhisheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Atmospher Boundary Layer Phys & Atm, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Han, Xingguo; Wu, Honghui] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Sutton, Mark A.] Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Penicuik EH26 0QB, Midlothian, Scotland","Butterbach-Bahl, K (reprint author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Kreuzeckbahnstr 19, D-82467 Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany.",klaus.butterbach-bahl@kit.edu,"Han, Xingguo/B-3980-2012; Sutton, Mark/K-2700-2012; Dannenmann, Michael/A-7278-2013; Wang, ZF/D-7202-2012; Brueggemann, Nicolas/C-4263-2014; Garmisch-Pa, Ifu/H-9902-2014; Han, Xingguo/K-7552-2016; Yao, Zhisheng/A-5749-2015; Butterbach-Bahl, Klaus/A-8081-2013","Wang, ZF/0000-0002-7062-6012; Brueggemann, Nicolas/0000-0003-3851-2418; Han, Xingguo/0000-0002-1836-975X; ",German Research Foundation (DFG) [536]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [40805061]; European Commission,"This work has been supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG research group 536, 'Matter fluxes in grasslands of Inner Mongolia as influenced by stocking rate') and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number 40805061), with co-funding from the NitroEurope Integrated Project of the European Commission.

Observations of azimuthal(2,3) and radial(4,5) anisotropy in the upper mantle are attributed to the lattice-preferred orientation of olivine caused by the shear strains associated with deformation, and provide some of the most direct evidence for deformation and flow within the Earth's interior. Although observations of crustal radial anisotropy would improve our understanding of crustal deformation and flow patterns resulting from tectonic processes, large-scale observations have been limited to regions of particularly thick crust(6). Here we show that observations from ambient noise tomography in the western United States reveal strong deep (middle to lower)-crustal radial anisotropy that is confined mainly to the geological provinces that have undergone significant extension during the Cenozoic Era (since similar to 65 Myr ago)(7,8). The coincidence of crustal radial anisotropy with the extensional provinces of the western United States suggests that the radial anisotropy results from the lattice-preferred orientation of anisotropic crustal minerals caused by extensional deformation. These observations also provide support for the hypothesis that the deep crust within these regions has undergone widespread and relatively uniform strain in response to crustal thinning and extension(9-11).","[Moschetti, M.

Although the most informative way of investigating and interpreting collective movement phenomena would be afforded by the collection of high-resolution spatio-temporal data from moving individuals, such data are scarce(4-7) and are virtually non-existent for long-distance group motion within a natural setting because of the associated technological difficulties(8). Here we present results of experiments in which track logs of homing pigeons flying in flocks of up to 10 individuals have been obtained by high-resolution lightweight GPS devices and analysed using a variety of correlation functions inspired by approaches common in statistical physics. We find a well-defined hierarchy among flock members from data concerning leading roles in pairwise interactions, defined on the basis of characteristic delay times between birds' directional choices. The average spatial position of a pigeon within the flock strongly correlates with its place in the hierarchy, and birds respond more quickly to conspecifics perceived primarily through the left eye-both results revealing differential roles for birds that assume different positions with respect to flock-mates. From an evolutionary perspective, our results suggest that hierarchical organization of group flight may be more efficient than an egalitarian one, at least for those flock sizes that permit regular pairwise interactions among group members, during which leader-follower relationships are consistently manifested.","[Nagy, Mate; Akos, Zsuzsa; Vicsek, Tamas] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Biol Phys, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary; [Biro, Dora] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Vicsek, Tamas] Hungarian Acad Sci, Stat & Biol Phys Res Grp, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary","Vicsek, T (reprint author), Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Biol Phys, Pazmany Peter Setany 1A, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary.",vicsek@hal.elte.hu,"Nagy, Mate/B-3180-2011","Nagy, Mate/0000-0001-8817-087X; Biro, Dora/0000-0002-3408-6274","EU; Royal Society; Somerville College, Oxford","We thank the Hungarian Racing Pigeon Sports Federation-in particular I.

To understand the process of dog diversification better, we conducted an extensive genome-wide survey of more than 48,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms in dogs and their wild progenitor, the grey wolf. Here we show that dog breeds share a higher proportion of multi-locus haplotypes unique to grey wolves from the Middle East, indicating that they are a dominant source of genetic diversity for dogs rather than wolves from east Asia, as suggested by mitochondrial DNA sequence data(3). Furthermore, we find a surprising correspondence between genetic and phenotypic/functional breed groupings but there are exceptions that suggest phenotypic diversification depended in part on the repeated crossing of individuals with novel phenotypes. Our results show that Middle Eastern wolves were a critical source of genome diversity, although interbreeding with local wolf populations clearly occurred elsewhere in the early history of specific lineages. More recently, the evolution of modern dog breeds seems to have been an iterative process that drew on a limited genetic toolkit to create remarkable phenotypic diversity.","[vonHoldt, Bridgett M.; Pollinger, John P.; Knowles, James C.; Novembre, John; Wayne, Robert K.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Lohmueller, Kirk E.; Degenhardt, Jeremiah D.; Boyko, Adam R.; Auton, Adam; Reynolds, Andy; Bryc, Kasia; Brisbin, Abra; Bustamante, Carlos D.] Cornell Univ, Dept Biol Stat & Computat Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Han, Eunjung] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Biostat, Los Angeles, CA 14853 USA; [Parker, Heidi G.; Quignon, Pascale; Mosher, Dana S.; Spady, Tyrone C.; Elkahloun, Abdel; Ostrander, Elaine A.] NHGRI, Canc Genet Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Earl, Dent A.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Biomol Engn, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Geffen, Eli] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Pilot, Malgorzata] Polish Acad Sci, Museum Zool, PL-00679 Warsaw, Poland; [Pilot, Malgorzata] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Zool, PL-00679 Warsaw, Poland; [Jedrzejewski, Wlodzimierz] Polish Acad Sci, Mammal Res Inst, PL-17230 Bialowieza, Poland; [Greco, Claudia; Randi, Ettore] ISPRA, I-40064 Ozzano Emilia B, Italy; [Bannasch, Danika] Univ Calif Davis, Sch Vet Med, Dept Populat Hlth & Reprod, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Wilton, Alan; Shearman, Jeremy] Univ New S Wales, Clive & Vera Ramaciotti Ctr Gene Funct Anal, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Wilton, Alan; Shearman, Jeremy] Univ New S Wales, Sch Biotechnol & Biomol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Musiani, Marco] Univ Calgary, Fac Environm Design, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [Cargill, Michelle] Affymetrix Corp, Santa Clara, CA 95051 USA; [Jones, Paul G.] WALTHAM Ctr Pet Nutr, Waltham On The Worlds LE14 4RT, Leics, England; [Qian, Zuwei; Huang, Wei] AZIA Ctr, Affymetrix Asia Pacific Sci Affairs & Collaborat, Shanghai 200120, Peoples R China; [Ding, Zhao-Li] Yunnan Univ, Lab Conservat & Utilizat Bioresources, Kunming 650091, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Ya-Ping] Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Zool, State Key Lab Genet Resources & Evolut, Kunming 650223, Peoples R China; [Novembre, John] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Interdepartmental Program Bioinformat, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Wayne, RK (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 621 Charles E Young Dr S, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",rwayne@ucla.edu,"Shearman, Jeremy/F-1618-2010; Wilton, Alan/C-2430-2011; Novembre, John/G-1339-2011","Greco, Claudia/0000-0002-8678-0890; Ostrander, Elaine/0000-0001-6075-9738",NSF; NIH; Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education; European Nature Heritage Fund EURONATUR; National Basic Research Program of China; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Searle Scholars Program; National Human Genome Research Institute; Foundation for Polish Science,"Grants from NSF and NIH (R.

In mammals, the medial temporal lobe is crucial for this rapid form of learning(1). The modification of synapses and neuronal circuits through plasticity is thought to underlie memory formation(2). The induction of synaptic plasticity is favoured by coordinated action-potential timing across populations of neurons(3). Such coordinated activity of neural populations can give rise to oscillations of different frequencies, recorded in local field potentials. Brain oscillations in the theta frequency range (3-8 Hz) are often associated with the favourable induction of synaptic plasticity as well as behavioural memory(4). Here we report the activity of single neurons recorded together with the local field potential in humans engaged in a learning task. We show that successful memory formation in humans is predicted by a tight coordination of spike timing with the local theta oscillation. More stereotyped spiking predicts better memory, as indicated by higher retrieval confidence reported by subjects. These findings provide a link between the known modulation of theta oscillations by many memory-modulating behaviours and circuit mechanisms of plasticity.","[Rutishauser, Ueli; Schuman, Erin M.] CALTECH, Div Biol, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Schuman, Erin M.] CALTECH, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Ross, Ian B.; Mamelak, Adam N.] Huntington Mem Hosp, Epilepsy & Brain Mapping Unit, Dept Neurosurg, Pasadena, CA 91105 USA; [Mamelak, Adam N.] Cedars Sinai Med Ctr, Dept Neurosurg, Los Angeles, CA 90048 USA","Schuman, EM (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Brain Res, Max von Laue Str 3, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany.",schumane@brain.mpg.de,"Schuman, Erin/D-6204-2011; Rutishauser, Ueli/E-5721-2011","Rutishauser, Ueli/0000-0002-9207-7069",Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation; William T.

These enzymes target polysaccharides from terrestrial plants that dominated diet throughout human evolution(2). The array of CAZymes in gut microbes is highly diverse, exemplified by the human gut symbiont Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron(3), which contains 261 glycoside hydrolases and polysaccharide lyases, as well as 208 homologues of susC and susD-genes coding for two outer membrane proteins involved in starch utilization(1,4). A fundamental question that, to our knowledge, has yet to be addressed is how this diversity evolved by acquiring new genes from microbes living outside the gut. Here we characterize the first porphyranases from a member of the marine Bacteroidetes, Zobellia galactanivorans, active on the sulphated polysaccharide porphyran from marine red algae of the genus Porphyra. Furthermore, we show that genes coding for these porphyranases, agarases and associated proteins have been transferred to the gut bacterium Bacteroides plebeius isolated from Japanese individuals(5). Our comparative gut metagenome analyses show that porphyranases and agarases are frequent in the Japanese population(6) and that they are absent in metagenome data(7) from North American individuals. Seaweeds make an important contribution to the daily diet in Japan (14.2 g per person per day)(8), and Porphyra spp. (nori) is the most important nutritional seaweed, traditionally used to prepare sushi(9,10). This indicates that seaweeds with associated marine bacteria may have been the route by which these novel CAZymes were acquired in human gut bacteria, and that contact with non-sterile food may be a general factor in CAZyme diversity in human gut microbes.","[Hehemann, Jan-Hendrik; Correc, Gaelle; Barbeyron, Tristan; Helbert, William; Czjzek, Mirjam; Michel, Gurvan] Univ Paris 06, F-29682 Roscoff, France; [Hehemann, Jan-Hendrik; Correc, Gaelle; Barbeyron, Tristan; Helbert, William; Czjzek, Mirjam; Michel, Gurvan] CNRS, Stn Biol Roscoff, Vegetaux Marins & Biomol UMR 7139, F-29682 Roscoff, France","Czjzek, M (reprint author), Univ Paris 06, F-29682 Roscoff, France.",czjzek@sb-roscoff.fr; gurvan@sb-roscoff.fr,"MICHEL, Gurvan/B-3490-2008; FIP, BM30A/I-5166-2015","MICHEL, Gurvan/0000-0002-3009-6205",French national research centre (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique); University Marie Curie; European Marie Curie PhD grant; Region Bretagne; GIS 'Genomique Marine'; French Research Ministry,"We thank B.

During Arabidopsis embryogenesis, an extra-embryonic cell is specified to become the founder cell of the primary root meristem, hypophysis, in response to signals from adjacent embryonic cells(2). The auxin-dependent transcription factor MONOPTEROS (MP) drives hypophysis specification by promoting transport of the hormone auxin from the embryo to the hypophysis precursor. However, auxin accumulation is not sufficient for hypophysis specification, indicating that additional MP-dependent signals are required(3). Here we describe the microarray-based isolation of MP target genes that mediate signalling from embryo to hypophysis. Of three direct transcriptional target genes, TARGET OF MP5 (TMO5) and TMO7 encode basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors that are expressed in the hypophysis-adjacent embryo cells, and are required and partially sufficient for MP-dependent root initiation. Importantly, the small TMO7 transcription factor moves from its site of synthesis in the embryo to the hypophysis precursor, thus representing a novel MP-dependent intercellular signal in embryonic root specification.","[Schlereth, Alexandra; Kientz, Marika; Juergens, Gerd; Weijers, Dolf] Univ Tubingen, ZMBP, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Moller, Barbara; Liu, Weilin; Flipse, Jacky; Rademacher, Eike H.; Weijers, Dolf] Wageningen Univ, Biochem Lab, NL-6703 HA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Schmid, Markus] Max Planck Inst Dev Biol, Dept Mol Biol, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany","Jurgens, G (reprint author), Univ Tubingen, ZMBP, Morgenstelle 3, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany.",gerd.juergens@zmbp.uni-tuebingen.de; dolf.weijers@wur.nl,"Weijers, Dolf/A-2076-2010; Rademacher, Eike/K-2302-2012; Schmid, Markus/I-4384-2015","Weijers, Dolf/0000-0003-4378-141X; Schmid, Markus/0000-0002-0068-2967; Flipse, Jacky/0000-0002-2195-5282; Moller, Barbara/0000-0001-6521-4200",Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [VIDI 864.06.012]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [SFB446]; Netherlands Proteomics Centre (NPC),"We acknowledge P. van Oorschot, A. van Haperen and S.

However, the detailed role of VEGF-B in blood vessel function has remained unclear(2,3). Here we show that VEGF-B has an unexpected role in endothelial targeting of lipids to peripheral tissues. Dietary lipids present in circulation have to be transported through the vascular endothelium to be metabolized by tissue cells, a mechanism that is poorly understood(4). Bioinformatic analysis showed that Vegfb was tightly co-expressed with nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes across a large variety of physiological conditions in mice, pointing to a role for VEGF-B in metabolism. VEGF-B specifically controlled endothelial uptake of fatty acids via transcriptional regulation of vascular fatty acid transport proteins. As a consequence, Vegfb(-/-) mice showed less uptake and accumulation of lipids in muscle, heart and brown adipose tissue, and instead shunted lipids to white adipose tissue. This regulation was mediated by VEGF receptor 1 and neuropilin 1 expressed by the endothelium. The co-expression of VEGF-B and mitochondrial proteins introduces a novel regulatory mechanism, whereby endothelial lipid uptake and mitochondrial lipid use are tightly coordinated. The involvement of VEGF-B in lipid uptake may open up the possibility for novel strategies to modulate pathological lipid accumulation in diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular diseases.","[Hagberg, Carolina E.; Falkevall, Annelie; Wang, Xun; Nilsson, Ingrid; Vanwildemeersch, Maarten; Pietras, Kristian; Eriksson, Ulf] Karolinska Inst, Tissue Biol Grp, Div Matrix Biol, Dept Med Biochem & Biophys, SE-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Hagberg, Carolina E.; Falkevall, Annelie; Wang, Xun; Vanwildemeersch, Maarten; Klar, Joakim; Pietras, Kristian; Eriksson, Ulf] Ludwig Inst Canc Res Ltd, Stockholm Branch, Karolinska Inst, SE-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Larsson, Erik; Lindahl, Per] Univ Gothenburg, Inst Biomed, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Huusko, Jenni; Yla-Herttuala, Seppo] Univ Kuopio, AI Virtanen Inst, Dept Biotechnol & Mol Med, FIN-70211 Kuopio, Finland; [van Meeteren, Laurens A.; Klar, Joakim; Claesson-Welsh, Lena] Uppsala Univ, Rudbeck Lab, Dept Genet & Pathol, SE-75185 Uppsala, Sweden; [Samen, Erik; Stone-Elander, Sharon] Karolinska Pharm, Karolinska Univ Hosp, SE-17176 Stockholm, Sweden; [Samen, Erik; Lu, Li; Stone-Elander, Sharon] Karolinska Inst, SE-17176 Stockholm, Sweden; [Genove, Guillem] Karolinska Inst, Lab Vasc Biol, Div Matrix Biol, Dept Med Biochem & Biophys, SE-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Lindahl, Per] Sahlgrens Univ Hosp, Wallenberg Lab Cardiovasc Res, SE-41345 Gothenburg, Sweden","Eriksson, U (reprint author), Karolinska Inst, Tissue Biol Grp, Div Matrix Biol, Dept Med Biochem & Biophys, SE-17177 Stockholm, Sweden.",ulf.pe.eriksson@ki.se,"; van Meeteren, Laurens/A-9890-2008; Genove, Guillem/F-1158-2011","Yla-Herttuala, Seppo/0000-0001-7593-2708; van Meeteren, Laurens/0000-0001-9885-0668; Genove, Guillem/0000-0002-8558-3107; Hagberg, Carolina/0000-0002-5497-2855; Klar, Joakim/0000-0003-4185-7409",Wilhelm och Else Stockmanns Stiftelse; Frans Wilhelm och Waldemar von Frenckells fond; European Commission [LSHG-CT-2004-503573]; Dutch Cancer Society; Novo Nordisk Foundation; Swedish Cancer Foundation; Swedish Research Council; Dr. Peter Wallenbergs Foundation for Economics and Technology; LeDucq Foundation; Swedish Brain Foundation and Hallstens Forskningsstiftelse; Karolinska Institutet,"We thank S.

This transition coincides with the formation of pluripotent cells, which in mammals can be used to generate embryonic stem cells. To study the changes in chromatin structure that accompany pluripotency and genome activation, we mapped the genomic locations of histone H3 molecules bearing lysine trimethylation modifications before and after the maternal-zygotic transition in zebrafish. Histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), which is repressive, and H3K4me3, which is activating, were not detected before the transition. After genome activation, more than 80% of genes were marked by H3K4me3, including many inactive developmental regulatory genes that were also marked by H3K27me3. Sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that the same promoter regions had both trimethylation marks. Such bivalent chromatin domains also exist in embryonic stem cells and are thought to poise genes for activation while keeping them repressed(4-8). Furthermore, we found many inactive genes that were uniquely marked by H3K4me3. Despite this activating modification, these monovalent genes were neither expressed nor stably bound by RNA polymerase II. Inspection of published data sets revealed similar monovalent domains in embryonic stem cells. Moreover, H3K4me3 marks could form in the absence of both sequence-specific transcriptional activators and stable association of RNA polymerase II, as indicated by the analysis of an inducible transgene. These results indicate that bivalent and monovalent domains might poise embryonic genes for activation and that the chromatin profile associated with pluripotency is established during the maternal-zygotic transition.","[Zhang, Yong; Liu, X.

These parasitic elements are responsible for >10% of spontaneous mutations(2). Whereas DNA methylation has an important role in proviral silencing in somatic and germ-lineage cells(3-5), an additional DNA-methylation-independent pathway also functions in embryonal carcinoma and embryonic stem (ES) cells to inhibit transcription of the exogenous gammaretrovirus murine leukaemia virus (MLV)(6-8). Notably, a recent genome-wide study revealed that ERVs are also marked by histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) and H4K20me3 in ES cells but not in mouse embryonic fibroblasts(9). However, the role that these marks have in proviral silencing remains unexplored. Here we show that the H3K9 methyltransferase ESET (also called SETDB1 or KMT1E) and the Kruppel-associated box (KRAB)associated protein 1 (KAP1, also called TRIM28)(10,11) are required for H3K9me3 and silencing of endogenous and introduced retroviruses specifically in mouse ES cells. Furthermore, whereas ESET enzymatic activity is crucial for HP1 binding and efficient proviral silencing, the H4K20 methyltransferases Suv420h1 and Suv420h2 are dispensable for silencing. Notably, in DNA methyltransferase triple knockout (Dnmt1(-/-) Dnmt3a(-/-) Dnmt3b(-/-)) mouse ES cells, ESET and KAP1 binding and ESET-mediated H3K9me3 are maintained and ERVs are minimally derepressed. We propose that a DNA-methylation-independent pathway involving KAP1 and ESET/ESET-mediated H3K9me3 is required for proviral silencing during the period early in embryogenesis when DNA methylation is dynamically reprogrammed.","[Matsui, Toshiyuki; Miyashita, Hiroki; Miyachi, Hitoshi; Tachibana, Makoto; Shinkai, Yoichi] Kyoto Univ, Inst Virus Res, Expt Res Ctr Infect Dis, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068507, Japan; [Matsui, Toshiyuki; Miyashita, Hiroki; Tachibana, Makoto; Shinkai, Yoichi] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Biostudies, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068507, Japan; [Leung, Danny; Maksakova, Irina A.; Lorincz, Matthew C.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Med Genet, Inst Life Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada; [Kimura, Hiroshi] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Frontier Biosci, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan","Shinkai, Y (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Inst Virus Res, Expt Res Ctr Infect Dis, Sakyo Ku, 53 Shogoin,Kawara Cho, Kyoto 6068507, Japan.",mlorincz@interchange.ubc.ca; yshinkai@virus.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Shinkai, Yoichi/N-3909-2014","Shinkai, Yoichi/0000-0002-6051-2484","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan; CIHR [77805, 92090]","We thank M.

Direct physical contact is required between the T cell and the antigen-presenting cell for cross-junctional binding where the TCR and pMHC are anchored on two-dimensional (2D) membranes of the apposing cells(1). Despite their 2D nature, TCR-pMHC binding kinetics have only been analysed three-dimensionally (3D) with a varying degree of correlation with the T-cell responsiveness(2-4). Here we use two mechanical assays(5,6) to show high 2D affinities between a TCR and its antigenic pMHC driven by rapid on-rates. Compared to their 3D counterparts, 2D affinities and on-rates of the TCR for a panel of pMHC ligands possess far broader dynamic ranges that match that of their corresponding T-cell responses. The best 3D predictor of response is the off-rate, with agonist pMHC dissociating the slowest(2-4). In contrast, 2D off-rates are up to 8,300-fold faster, with the agonist pMHC dissociating the fastest. Our 2D data suggest rapid antigen sampling by T cells and serial engagement of a few agonist pMHCs by TCRs in a large self pMHC background. Thus, the cellular environment amplifies the intrinsic TCR-pMHC binding to generate broad affinities and rapid kinetics that determine T-cell responsiveness.","[Huang, Jun; Zarnitsyna, Veronika I.; Liu, Baoyu; Jiang, Ning; Zhu, Cheng] Georgia Inst Technol, Coulter Dept Biomed Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Edwards, Lindsay J.; Evavold, Brian D.] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA","Zhu, C (reprint author), Georgia Inst Technol, Coulter Dept Biomed Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",bevavol@emory.edu; cheng.zhu@bme.gatech.edu,"Huang, Jun/E-8472-2010; Zhu, Cheng/A-5724-2011; Liu, Baoyu/C-4911-2009; Jiang, Ning/M-5448-2017","Liu, Baoyu/0000-0002-0798-6314; Jiang, Ning/0000-0003-1103-5922; Zarnitsyna, Veronika/0000-0003-3096-3695; Evavold, Brian/0000-0002-3561-3494","NIH [AI38282, AI060799]; National Multiple Sclerosis Society [RG4047-A-3];  [NS062358]","We thank the NIH Tetramer Core Facility at Emory University for providing MHC monomers, J.

However, despite its importance, the molecular intermediates of mitotic DSB repair remain undefined. The double Holliday junction (DHJ), presupposed to be the central intermediate for more than 25 years(1), has only been identified during meiotic recombination(2). Moreover, evidence has accumulated for alternative, DHJ-independent mechanisms(3-6), raising the possibility that DHJs are not formed during DSB repair in mitotically cycling cells. Here we identify intermediates of DSB repair by using a budding-yeast assay system designed to mimic physiological DSB repair. This system uses diploid cells and provides the possibility for allelic recombination either between sister chromatids or between homologues, as well as direct comparison with meiotic recombination at the same locus. In mitotically cycling cells, we detect inter-homologue joint molecule (JM) intermediates whose strand composition and size are identical to those of the canonical DHJ structures observed in meiosis(2). However, in contrast to meiosis, JMs between sister chromatids form in preference to those between homologues. Moreover, JMs seem to represent a minor pathway of DSB repair in mitotic cells, being detected at about tenfold lower levels (per DSB) than during meiotic recombination. Thus, although DHJs are identified as intermediates of DSB-promoted recombination in both mitotic and meiotic cells, their formation is distinctly regulated according to the specific dictates of the two cellular programs.","[Bzymek, Malgorzata; Hunter, Neil] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Microbiol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Hunter, Neil] Univ Calif Davis, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Hunter, Neil] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Thayer, Nathaniel H.] Univ Washington, Mol & Cellular Biol PhD Program, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Oh, Steve D.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pathol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Oh, Steve D.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Ctr Comprehens Canc, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Kleckner, Nancy] Harvard Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Hunter, N (reprint author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Microbiol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",nhunter@ucdavis.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Institute of General Medical Sciences [GM025326, GM074223]","We thank R.

However, a demonstration that quantum mechanics applies equally to macroscopic mechanical systems has been a long-standing challenge, hindered by the difficulty of cooling a mechanical mode to its quantum ground state. The temperatures required are typically far below those attainable with standard cryogenic methods, so significant effort has been devoted to developing alternative cooling techniques. Once in the ground state, quantum-limited measurements must then be demonstrated. Here, using conventional cryogenic refrigeration, we show that we can cool a mechanical mode to its quantum ground state by using a microwave-frequency mechanical oscillator-a 'quantum drum'-coupled to a quantum bit, which is used to measure the quantum state of the resonator. We further show that we can controllably create single quantum excitations (phonons) in the resonator, thus taking the first steps to complete quantum control of a mechanical system.","[O'Connell, A.

Here we use tiling oligonucleotide microarrays, comprising 42 million probes, to generate a comprehensive map of 11,700 copy number variations (CNVs) greater than 443 base pairs, of which most (8,599) have been validated independently. For 4,978 of these CNVs, we generated reference genotypes from 450 individuals of European, African or East Asian ancestry. The predominant mutational mechanisms differ among CNV size classes. Retrotransposition has duplicated and inserted some coding and non-coding DNA segments randomly around the genome. Furthermore, by correlation with known trait-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we identified 30 loci with CNVs that are candidates for influencing disease susceptibility. Despite this, having assessed the completeness of our map and the patterns of linkage disequilibrium between CNVs and SNPs, we conclude that, for complex traits, the heritability void left by genome-wide association studies will not be accounted for by common CNVs.","[Conrad, Donald F.; Redon, Richard; Zhang, Yujun; Aerts, Jan; Andrews, T.

To address this we undertook a large, direct genome-wide study of association between CNVs and eight common human diseases. Using a purpose-designed array we typed,19,000 individuals into distinct copy-number classes at 3,432 polymorphic CNVs, including an estimated similar to 50% of all common CNVs larger than 500 base pairs. We identified several biological artefacts that lead to false-positive associations, including systematic CNV differences between DNAs derived from blood and cell lines. Association testing and follow-up replication analyses confirmed three loci where CNVs were associated with disease-IRGM for Crohn's disease, HLA for Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes, and TSPAN8 for type 2 diabetes-although in each case the locus had previously been identified in single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based studies, reflecting our observation that most common CNVs that are well-typed on our array are well tagged by SNPs and so have been indirectly explored through SNP studies. We conclude that common CNVs that can be typed on existing platforms are unlikely to contribute greatly to the genetic basis of common human diseases.","[Craddock, Nick; Forty, Liz; Green, Elaine; Grozeva, Detelina; Jones, Ian R.; Kirov, George; O'Donovan, Michael C.; Owen, Michael J.; Russell, Ellie] Cardiff Univ, MRC, Ctr Neuropsychiat Genet & Genom, Sch Med, Cardiff CF14 4XN, Wales; [Hurles, Matthew E.; Robson, Samuel; Barnes, Chris; Conrad, Donald F.; Stirrups, Kathy; Aerts, Jan; Andrews, T.

To start to fill this gap we developed a high-throughput phenotypic screening platform combining potent gene silencing by RNA interference, time-lapse microscopy and computational image processing. We carried out a genome-wide phenotypic profiling of each of the similar to 21,000 human protein-coding genes by two-day live imaging of fluorescently labelled chromosomes. Phenotypes were scored quantitatively by computational image processing, which allowed us to identify hundreds of human genes involved in diverse biological functions including cell division, migration and survival.

Available treatments for this disease are poor, with unacceptable efficacy and safety profiles, particularly in the late stage of the disease when the parasite has infected the central nervous system. Here we report the validation of a molecular target and the discovery of associated lead compounds with the potential to address this lack of suitable treatments. Inhibition of this target-T. brucei N-myristoyltransferase-leads to rapid killing of trypanosomes both in vitro and in vivo and cures trypanosomiasis in mice. These high-affinity inhibitors bind into the peptide substrate pocket of the enzyme and inhibit protein N-myristoylation in trypanosomes. The compounds identified have promising pharmaceutical properties and represent an opportunity to develop oral drugs to treat this devastating disease. Our studies validate T. brucei N-myristoyltransferase as a promising therapeutic target for human African trypanosomiasis.","[Frearson, Julie A.; Brand, Stephen; McElroy, Stuart P.; Cleghorn, Laura A.

Prominent examples are dust-obscured galaxies which are luminous when observed at sub-millimetre wavelengths and which may be forming stars at a rate of 1,000 solar masses (M(circle dot)) per year(4-7). These intense bursts of star formation are believed to be driven by mergers between gas-rich galaxies(8-9). Probing the properties of individual star-forming regions within these galaxies, however, is beyond the spatial resolution and sensitivity of even the largest telescopes at present. Here we report observations of the sub-millimetre galaxy SMMJ2135-0102 at redshift z = 2.3259, which has been gravitationally magnified by a factor of 32 by a massive foreground galaxy cluster lens. This magnification, when combined with high-resolution sub-millimetre imaging, resolves the star-forming regions at a linear scale of only 100 parsecs. We find that the luminosity densities of these star-forming regions are comparable to the dense cores of giant molecular clouds in the local Universe, but they are about a hundred times larger and 10(7) times more luminous. Although vigorously star-forming, the underlying physics of the star-formation processes at z approximate to 2 appears to be similar to that seen in local galaxies, although the energetics are unlike anything found in the present-day Universe.","[Swinbank, A.

In the case of optical waves, a light beam with a phase singularity carries orbital angular momentum, and such beams have found a range of applications in optical manipulation, quantum information and astronomy(3-9). Here we report the generation of an electron beam with a phase singularity propagating in free space, which we achieve by passing a plane electron wave through a spiral phase plate constructed naturally from a stack of graphite thin films. The interference pattern between the final beam and a plane electron wave in a transmission electron microscope shows the 'Y'-like defect pattern characteristic of a beam carrying a phase singularity with a topological charge equal to one. This fundamentally new electron degree of freedom could find application in a number of research areas, as is the case for polarized electron beams.","[Uchida, Masaya; Tonomura, Akira] RIKEN, Inst Phys & Chem Res, Adv Sci Inst, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan","Uchida, M (reprint author), RIKEN, Inst Phys & Chem Res, Adv Sci Inst, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan.",masaya1.uchida@gmail.com,,,,,,30,233,239,6,98,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,1-Apr,2010,464,7289,,,,,737,739,,10.1038/nature08904,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,577EO,WOS:000276205000040,20360737.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,akira,tonomura,male,0.86,56,na,na

Understanding the physical mechanisms leading to events such as the Younger Dryas cold interval requires identification of the paths and timing of the freshwater discharges. Although Broecker et al. hypothesized in 1989 that an outburst from glacial Lake Agassiz triggered the Younger Dryas(1), specific evidence has so far proved elusive, leading Broecker to conclude in 2006 that ""our inability to identify the path taken by the flood is disconcerting''(2). Here we identify the missing flood path-evident from gravels and a regional erosion surface-running through the Mackenzie River system in the Canadian Arctic Coastal Plain. Our modelling of the isostatically adjusted surface in the upstream Fort McMurray region, and a slight revision of the ice margin at this time, allows Lake Agassiz to spill into the Mackenzie drainage basin. From optically stimulated luminescence dating we have determined the approximate age of this Mackenzie River flood into the Arctic Ocean to be shortly after 13,000 years ago, near the start of the Younger Dryas. We attribute to this flood a boulder terrace near Fort McMurray with calibrated radiocarbon dates of over 11,500 years ago. A large flood into the Arctic Ocean at the start of the Younger Dryas leads us to reject the widespread view that Agassiz overflow at this time was solely eastward into the North Atlantic Ocean.","[Murton, Julian B.] Univ Sussex, Dept Geog, Permafrost Lab, Brighton BN1 9QJ, E Sussex, England; [Bateman, Mark D.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Geog, Sheffield Ctr Int Drylands Res, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Dallimore, Scott R.] Geol Survey Canada, Sidney, BC V8L 4B2, Canada; [Teller, James T.; Yang, Zhirong] Univ Manitoba, Dept Geol Sci, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada","Murton, JB (reprint author), Univ Sussex, Dept Geog, Permafrost Lab, Brighton BN1 9QJ, E Sussex, England.",j.b.murton@sussex.ac.uk,,"bateman, mark/0000-0003-1756-6046; Murton, Julian/0000-0002-9469-5856",Royal Society; Quaternary Research Association; British Society for Geomorphology; Geological Survey of Canada; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,"The Mackenzie Delta research was funded by the Royal Society, the Quaternary Research Association, the British Society for Geomorphology and the Geological Survey of Canada.

It has been inferred that the greenhouse effect of atmospheric CO(2) and/or CH(4) compensated for the lower solar luminosity and dictated an Archaean climate in which liquid water was stable in the hydrosphere(5-8). Here we demonstrate, however, that the mineralogy of Archaean sediments, particularly the ubiquitous presence of mixed-valence Fe(II-III) oxides (magnetite) in banded iron formations(9) is inconsistent with such high concentrations of greenhouse gases and the metabolic constraints of extant methanogens. Prompted by this, and the absence of geologic evidence for very high greenhouse-gas concentrations(10-13), we hypothesize that a lower albedo on the Earth, owing to considerably less continental area and to the lack of biologically induced cloud condensation nuclei(14), made an important contribution to moderating surface temperature in the Archaean eon. Our model calculations suggest that the lower albedo of the early Earth provided environmental conditions above the freezing point of water, thus alleviating the need for extreme greenhouse-gas concentrations to satisfy the faint early Sun paradox.","[Rosing, Minik T.; Bird, Dennis K.; Bjerrum, Christian J.] Univ Copenhagen, Nord Ctr Earth Evolut, DK-1350 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Rosing, Minik T.] Univ Copenhagen, Nat Hist Museum Denmark, DK-1350 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Bjerrum, Christian J.] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geog & Geol, DK-1350 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Rosing, Minik T.; Bird, Dennis K.] Stanford Univ, Dept Geol & Environm Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Sleep, Norman H.] Stanford Univ, Dept Geophys, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Rosing, MT (reprint author), Univ Copenhagen, Nord Ctr Earth Evolut, Oster Voldgade 5-7, DK-1350 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",minik@snm.ku.dk,"Rosing, Minik/A-9977-2013; Bjerrum, Christian/A-4247-2015","Rosing, Minik/0000-0001-7559-661X; Bjerrum, Christian/0000-0002-7804-1633","Danish National Research Foundation; Allan C.

Zircon fission-track ages from these sites indicated that hominins had colonized the island by 0.88 +/- 0.07 million years (Myr) ago(6). Here we describe the contents, context and age of Wolo Sege, a recently discovered archaeological site in the Soa Basin that has in situ stone artefacts and that lies stratigraphically below Mata Menge and immediately above the basement breccias of the basin. We show using Ar-40/Ar-39 dating that an ignimbrite overlying the artefact layers at Wolo Sege was erupted 1.02 +/- 0.02 Myr ago, providing a new minimum age for hominins on Flores. This predates the disappearance from the Soa Basin of 'pygmy' Stegodon sondaari and Geochelone spp. (giant tortoise), as evident at the nearby site of Tangi Talo, which has been dated to 0.90 +/- 0.07 Myr ago(10). It now seems that this extirpation or possible extinction event and the associated faunal turnover were the result of natural processes rather than the arrival of hominins(9). It also appears that the volcanic and fluvio-lacustrine deposits infilling the Soa Basin may not be old enough to register the initial arrival of hominins on the island.","[Jensen, Gitte M.; Storey, Michael] Roskilde Univ, Dept Environm Social & Spatial Change, Quaternary Dating Lab, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; [Brumm, Adam; van den Bergh, Gert D.; Morwood, Michael J.] Univ Wollongong, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Ctr Archaeol Sci, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; [Kurniawan, Iwan; Aziz, Fachroel] Geol Survey Inst, Bandung 40122, Indonesia; [van den Bergh, Gert D.] Natl Museum Nat Hist, NL-2333 CR Leiden, Netherlands","Storey, M (reprint author), Roskilde Univ, Dept Environm Social & Spatial Change, Quaternary Dating Lab, POB 260, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.",abrumm@uow.edu.au; storey@ruc.dk,,"Storey, Michael/0000-0002-3126-4637; van den Bergh, Gerrit Dirk/0000-0003-1507-3336","Australian Research Council (ARC); Australian National University; McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, University of Cambridge; D.

However, there is no broad consensus regarding the value of p: whereas many studies have asserted that p is 3/4 (refs 1-4; 'Kleiber's law'), some have argued that it is 2/3 (refs 5-7), and others have found that it varies depending on factors like environment and taxonomy(6,8-16). Here we show that the relationship between mass and metabolic rate has convex curvature on a logarithmic scale, and is therefore not a pure power law, even after accounting for body temperature. This finding has several consequences. First, it provides an explanation for the puzzling variability in estimates of p, settling a long-standing debate. Second, it constitutes a stringent test for theories of metabolic scaling. A widely debated model(17) based on vascular system architecture fails this test, and we suggest modifications that could bring it into compliance with the observed curvature. Third, it raises the intriguing question of whether the scaling relation limits body size.","[Kolokotrones, Tom; Deeds, Eric J.; Fontana, Walter] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Savage, Van] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA","Fontana, W (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",walter@hms.harvard.edu,,,NIA NIH HHS [R01 AG034994],,,30,184,189,9,88,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,1-Apr,2010,464,7289,,,,,753,756,,10.1038/nature08920,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,577EO,WOS:000276205000044,20360740.0,No,,,11/20/17,walter,fontana,male,1,864,bz8Z_0UAAAAJ,13065

Like other songbirds, the zebra finch communicates through learned vocalizations, an ability otherwise documented only in humans and a few other animals and lacking in the chicken(5)-the only bird with a sequenced genome until now(6). Here we present a structural, functional and comparative analysis of the genome sequence of the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), which is a songbird belonging to the large avian order Passeriformes(7). We find that the overall structures of the genomes are similar in zebra finch and chicken, but they differ in many intrachromosomal rearrangements, lineage-specific gene family expansions, the number of long-terminal-repeat-based retrotransposons, and mechanisms of sex chromosome dosage compensation. We show that song behaviour engages gene regulatory networks in the zebra finch brain, altering the expression of long non-coding RNAs, microRNAs, transcription factors and their targets. We also show evidence for rapid molecular evolution in the songbird lineage of genes that are regulated during song experience.

In particular, macroscopic measurements of brain activity in patients suggest that functional connectivity between the frontal and temporal lobes may be altered(3,4). However, it remains unclear whether such dysconnectivity relates to the aetiology of the illness, and how it is manifested in the activity of neural circuits. Because schizophrenia has a strong genetic component(5), animal models of genetic risk factors are likely to aid our understanding of the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of the disease. Here we study Df(16)A(+/-) mice, which model a microdeletion on human chromosome 22 (22q11.2) that constitutes one of the largest known genetic risk factors for schizophrenia(6). To examine functional connectivity in these mice, we measured the synchronization of neural activity between the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex during the performance of a task requiring working memory, which is one of the cognitive functions disrupted in the disease. In wild-type mice, hippocampal-prefrontal synchrony increased during working memory performance, consistent with previous reports in rats(7). Df(16)A(+/-) mice, which are impaired in the acquisition of the task, showed drastically reduced synchrony, measured both by phase-locking of prefrontal cells to hippocampal theta oscillations and by coherence of prefrontal and hippocampal local field potentials. Furthermore, the magnitude of hippocampal-prefrontal coherence at the onset of training could be used to predict the time it took the Df(16)A(+/-) mice to learn the task and increased more slowly during task acquisition. These data suggest how the deficits in functional connectivity observed in patients with schizophrenia may be realized at the single-neuron level. Our findings further suggest that impaired long-range synchrony of neural activity is one consequence of the 22q11.2 deletion and may be a fundamental component of the pathophysiology underlying schizophrenia.","[Sigurdsson, Torfi; Stark, Kimberly L.; Karayiorgou, Maria; Gordon, Joshua A.] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Stark, Kimberly L.; Gogos, Joseph A.] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Physiol & Cellular Biophys, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Gogos, Joseph A.] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Neurosci, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Karayiorgou, Maria; Gordon, Joshua A.] New York State Psychiat Inst & Hosp, New York, NY 10032 USA","Gordon, JA (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10032 USA.",jag90@columbia.edu; jg343@columbia.edu,"Gordon, Joshua/E-6778-2012",,"Simons Foundation; US National Institute of Mental Health [MH67068, MH081968]; Lieber Center for Schizophrenia Research and Treatment","We would like to thank M.

Although all eQTL studies so far have assayed messenger RNA levels using expression microarrays, recent advances in RNA sequencing enable the analysis of transcript variation at unprecedented resolution. We sequenced RNA from 69 lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from unrelated Nigerian individuals that have been extensively genotyped by the International HapMap Project(2). By pooling data from all individuals, we generated a map of the transcriptional landscape of these cells, identifying extensive use of unannotated untranslated regions and more than 100 new putative protein-coding exons. Using the genotypes from the HapMap project, we identified more than a thousand genes at which genetic variation influences overall expression levels or splicing. We demonstrate that eQTLs near genes generally act by a mechanism involving allele-specific expression, and that variation that influences the inclusion of an exon is enriched within and near the consensus splice sites. Our results illustrate the power of high-throughput sequencing for the joint analysis of variation in transcription, splicing and allele-specific expression across individuals.","[Pickrell, Joseph K.; Marioni, John C.; Pai, Athma A.; Degner, Jacob F.; Nkadori, Everlyne; Veyrieras, Jean-Baptiste; Stephens, Matthew; Gilad, Yoav; Pritchard, Jonathan K.] Univ Chicago, Dept Human Genet, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Engelhardt, Barbara E.] Univ Chicago, Dept Comp Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Nkadori, Everlyne; Pritchard, Jonathan K.] Univ Chicago, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Stephens, Matthew] Univ Chicago, Dept Stat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Pickrell, JK (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Dept Human Genet, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",pickrell@uchicago.edu; gilad@uchicago.edu; pritch@uchicago.edu,,"Marioni, John/0000-0001-9092-0852; /0000-0002-7995-9948; Edsall, Lee Elizabeth/0000-0002-0326-2829","HHMI; NIH [MH084703-01, GM077959]","We thank D.

Many studies have previously identified genetic variants for gene expression phenotypes using custom and commercially available microarrays(1-5). Second generation sequencing technologies are now providing unprecedented access to the fine structure of the transcriptome(6-14). We have sequenced the mRNA fraction of the transcriptome in 60 extended HapMap individuals of European descent and have combined these data with genetic variants from the HapMap3 project(15). We have quantified exon abundance based on read depth and have also developed methods to quantify whole transcript abundance. We have found that approximately 10 million reads of sequencing can provide access to the same dynamic range as arrays with better quantification of alternative and highly abundant transcripts. Correlation with SNPs (small nucleotide polymorphisms) leads to a larger discovery of eQTLs (expression quantitative trait loci) than with arrays. We also detect a substantial number of variants that influence the structure of mature transcripts indicating variants responsible for alternative splicing. Finally, measures of allele-specific expression allowed the identification of rare eQTLs and allelic differences in transcript structure.

Impaired apoptotic cell clearance (due to defective recognition, internalization or degradation) results in autoimmune disease(1,2). One fundamental challenge in understanding how defects in corpse removal translate into diseased states is the identification of critical components orchestrating the different stages of engulfment. Here we use genetic, cell biological and molecular studies in Caenorhabditis elegans and mammalian cells to identify SAND-1 and its partner CCZ-1 as new factors in corpse removal. In worms deficient in either sand-1 or ccz-1, apoptotic cells are internalized and the phagosomes recruit the small GTPase RAB-5 but fail to progress to the subsequent RAB-7(+) stage. The mammalian orthologues of SAND-1, namely Mon1a and Mon1b, were similarly required for phagosome maturation. Mechanistically, Mon1 interacts with GTP-bound Rab5, identifying Mon1 as a previously unrecognized Rab5 effector. Moreover, a Mon1-Ccz1 complex (but not either protein alone) could bind Rab7 and could also influence Rab7 activation, suggesting Mon1-Ccz1 as an important link in progression from the Rab5-positive stage to the Rab7-positive stage of phagosome maturation. Taken together, these data identify SAND-1 (Mon1) and CCZ-1 (Ccz1) as critical and evolutionarily conserved components regulating the processing of ingested apoptotic cell corpses.","[Kinchen, Jason M.; Ravichandran, Kodi S.] Univ Virginia, Ctr Cell Clearance, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Ravichandran, Kodi S.] Univ Virginia, Beirne Carter Ctr Immunol Res, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Kinchen, Jason M.; Ravichandran, Kodi S.] Univ Virginia, Dept Microbiol, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA","Ravichandran, KS (reprint author), Univ Virginia, Ctr Cell Clearance, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA.",kinchen@virginia.edu; ravi@virginia.edu,,,NIH; American Heart Association; NIGMS/NIH,"We thank J.

EGFR signalling is preceded by receptor dimerization, typically thought to result from a ligand-induced conformational change in the ectodomain that exposes a loop (dimerization arm) required for receptor association. Ligand binding may also trigger allosteric changes in the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor that is crucial for signalling(5-7). Despite these insights, ensemble-averaging approaches have not determined the precise mechanism of receptor activation in situ. Using quantum-dot-based optical tracking of single molecules(8-11) combined with a novel time-dependent diffusivity analysis, here we present the dimerization dynamics of individual EGFRs on living cells. Before ligand addition, EGFRs spontaneously formed finite-lifetime dimers kinetically stabilized by their dimerization arms(12-14). The dimers were primed both for ligand binding and for signalling, such that after EGF addition they rapidly showed a very slow diffusivity state that correlated with activation. Although the kinetic stability of unliganded dimers was in principle sufficient for EGF-independent activation, ligand binding was still required for signalling. Interestingly, dimers were enriched in the cell periphery in an actin-and receptor-expression-dependent fashion, resulting in a peripheral enhancement of EGF-induced signalling that may enable polarized responses to growth factors.","[Chung, Inhee; Akita, Robert; Vandlen, Richard; Mellman, Ira] Genentech Inc, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Toomre, Derek] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Schlessinger, Joseph] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Deparment Pharmacol, New Haven, CT 06510 USA","Mellman, I (reprint author), Genentech Inc, 1 DNA Way, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA.",mellman.ira@gene.com,,,Research Foundation-Flanders; Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders ('Generisch Basisonderzoek aan de Universiteiten'); Ghent University; National Institutes of Health; Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnologia; Comunidad de Madrid,"We thank F.

On perception of JA-Ile, JAZ proteins are degraded and JA-Ile-dependent gene expression is activated(6,7). The molecular mechanisms by which JAZ proteins repress gene expression remain unknown. Here we show that the Arabidopsis JAZ proteins recruit the Groucho/Tup1-type corepressor TOPLESS (TPL)(8) and TPL-related proteins (TPRs) through a previously uncharacterized adaptor protein, designated Novel Interactor of JAZ (NINJA). NINJA acts as a transcriptional repressor whose activity is mediated by a functional TPL-binding EAR repression motif. Accordingly, both NINJA and TPL proteins function as negative regulators of jasmonate responses. Our results point to TPL proteins as general co-repressors that affect multiple signalling pathways through the interaction with specific adaptor proteins. This new insight reveals how stress-related and growth-related signalling cascades use common molecular mechanisms to regulate gene expression in plants.","[Pauwels, Laurens; Geerinck, Jan; Tilleman, Sofie; Grunewald, Wim; Perez, Amparo Cuellar; Vanden Bossche, Robin; Inze, Dirk; De Jaeger, Geert; Goossens, Alain] Univ Ghent VIB, Dept Plant Syst Biol, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium; [Pauwels, Laurens; Geerinck, Jan; Tilleman, Sofie; Grunewald, Wim; Perez, Amparo Cuellar; Vanden Bossche, Robin; Inze, Dirk; De Jaeger, Geert; Goossens, Alain] Univ Ghent, Dept Plant Biotechnol & Genet, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium; [Barbero, Gemma Fernandez; Chico, Jose Manuel; Solano, Roberto] Ctr Nacl Biotecnol CSIC, Dept Genet Mol Plantas, Madrid 28049, Spain; [Gil, Eduardo; Garcia-Casado, Gloria; Solano, Roberto] Ctr Nacl Biotecnol CSIC, Genom Unit, Madrid 28049, Spain; [Grunewald, Wim] Univ Ghent, Dept Mol Biotechnol, Fac Biosci Engn, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Sewell, Jared; Long, Jeff A.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Plant Biol Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Witters, Erwin] Univ Antwerp, EBT CEPROMA, Dept Biol, B-2020 Antwerp, Belgium; [Witters, Erwin] VITO MANT, Flemish Inst Technol Res, B-2400 Mol, Belgium","Goossens, A (reprint author), Univ Ghent VIB, Dept Plant Syst Biol, Technol Pk 927, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium.",alain.goossens@psb.vib-ugent.be,"Solano, Roberto/O-5908-2017","Solano, Roberto/0000-0001-5459-2417; De Jaeger, Geert/0000-0001-6558-5669; Sewell, Jared/0000-0003-3229-2645; Goossens, Alain/0000-0002-1599-551X; Inze, Dirk/0000-0002-3217-8407",Research Foundation-Flanders; Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders ('Generisch Basisonderzoek aan de Universiteiten'); Ghent University; National Institutes of Health; Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnologia; Comunidad de Madrid,"We thank F.

As a component of co-repressor complexes, LSD1 contributes to target gene repression by removing mono-and dimethyl marks from lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4)(1,3). In contrast, during androgen receptor (AR)-activated gene expression, LSD1 removes mono-and dimethyl marks from lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K9)(2). Yet, the mechanisms that control this dual specificity of demethylation are unknown. Here we show that phosphorylation of histone H3 at threonine 6 (H3T6) by protein kinase C beta I (PKC beta(I), also known as PRKCb beta) is the key event that prevents LSD1 from demethylating H3K4 during AR-dependent gene activation. In vitro, histone H3 peptides methylated at lysine 4 and phosphorylated at threonine 6 are no longer LSD1 substrates. In vivo, PKC beta(I) co-localizes with AR and LSD1 on target gene promoters and phosphorylates H3T6 after androgen-induced gene expression. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of PKC beta(I) abrogates H3T6 phosphorylation, enhances demethylation at H3K4, and inhibits AR-dependent transcription. Activation of PKC beta(I) requires androgen-dependent recruitment of the gatekeeper kinase protein kinase C (PKC)-related kinase 1 (PRK1)(4). Notably, increased levels of PKC beta(I) and phosphorylated H3T6 (H3T6ph) positively correlate with high Gleason scores of prostate carcinomas, and inhibition of PKC beta(I) blocks AR-induced tumour cell proliferation in vitro and cancer progression of tumour xeno-grafts in vivo. Together, our data establish that androgen-dependent kinase signalling leads to the writing of the new chromatin mark H3T6ph, which in consequence prevents removal of active methyl marks from H3K4 during AR-stimulated gene expression.","[Metzger, Eric; Patel, Dharmeshkumar; Hoffmeyer, Katrin; Friedrichs, Nicolaus; Mueller, Judith M.; Greschik, Holger; Ji, Sujuan; Kunowska, Natalia; Guenther, Thomas; Schuele, Roland] Univ Freiburg Klinikum, Urol Klin, Frauenklin, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [Metzger, Eric; Patel, Dharmeshkumar; Hoffmeyer, Katrin; Friedrichs, Nicolaus; Mueller, Judith M.; Greschik, Holger; Ji, Sujuan; Kunowska, Natalia; Guenther, Thomas; Schuele, Roland] Univ Freiburg Klinikum, Zent Klin Forsch, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [Beisenherz-Huss, Christian] ProQinase, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [Imhof, Axel] Univ Munich, Adolf Butenandt Inst, D-80336 Munich, Germany; [Imhof, Axel] Univ Munich, Munich CIPS, D-80336 Munich, Germany; [Kahl, Philip; Kirfel, Jutta; Buettner, Reinhard] Univ Klinikum Bonn, Inst Pathol, D-53127 Bonn, Germany","Schule, R (reprint author), Univ Freiburg Klinikum, Urol Klin, Frauenklin, Breisacherstr 66, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany.",roland.schuele@uniklinik-freiburg.de,,,"Deutsche Krebshilfe; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB 746/P2, Schu 688/9-1, SFB 832/Z1]","We thank U.

Here we present evidence for a fourth pathway, possibly of considerable geochemical and evolutionary importance. The pathway was discovered after metagenomic sequencing of an enrichment culture that couples anaerobic oxidation of methane with the reduction of nitrite to dinitrogen. The complete genome of the dominant bacterium, named 'Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera', was assembled. This apparently anaerobic, denitrifying bacterium encoded, transcribed and expressed the well-established aerobic pathway for methane oxidation, whereas it lacked known genes for dinitrogen production. Subsequent isotopic labelling indicated that 'M. oxyfera' bypassed the denitrification intermediate nitrous oxide by the conversion of two nitric oxidemolecules to dinitrogen and oxygen, which was used to oxidize methane. These results extend our understanding of hydrocarbon degradation under anoxic conditions and explain the biochemical mechanism of a poorly understood freshwater methane sink. Because nitrogen oxides were already present on early Earth, our finding opens up the possibility that oxygen was available to microbial metabolism before the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis.","[Ettwig, Katharina F.; Butler, Margaret K.; van Alen, Theo; Luesken, Francisca; Wu, Ming L.; van de Pas-Schoonen, Katinka T.; den Camp, Huub J.

Determining the coronary artery developmental program could aid understanding of the disease and lead to new treatments, but many aspects of the process, including their developmental origin, remain obscure. Here we show, using histological and clonal analysis in mice and cardiac organ culture, that coronary vessels arise from angiogenic sprouts of the sinus venosus-the vein that returns blood to the embryonic heart. Sprouting venous endothelial cells dedifferentiate as they migrate over and invade the myocardium. Invading cells differentiate into arteries and capillaries; cells on the surface redifferentiate into veins. These results show that some differentiated venous cells retain developmental plasticity, and indicate that position-specific cardiac signals trigger their dedifferentiation and conversion into coronary arteries, capillaries and veins. Understanding this new reprogramming process and identifying the endogenous signals should suggest more natural ways of engineering coronary bypass grafts and revascularizing the heart.","[Red-Horse, Kristy; Krasnow, Mark A.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Red-Horse, Kristy; Krasnow, Mark A.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Ueno, Hiroo; Weissman, Irving L.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Inst Stem Cell Biol & Regenerat Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Krasnow, MA (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",krasnow@stanford.edu,,,National Institutes of Health [2T32HD007249],"We thank T.

These epithelial cells line the cerebral ventricles and generate intermediate progenitor cells that migrate into the subventricular zone (SVZ) and proliferate to increase neuronal number. The developing human SVZ has a massively expanded outer region (OSVZ) thought to contribute to cortical size and complexity. However, OSVZ progenitor cell types and their contribution to neurogenesis are not well understood. Here we show that large numbers of radial glia-like cells and intermediate progenitor cells populate the human OSVZ. We find that OSVZ radial glia-like cells have a long basal process but, surprisingly, are non-epithelial as they lack contact with the ventricular surface. Using real-time imaging and clonal analysis, we demonstrate that these cells can undergo proliferative divisions and self-renewing asymmetric divisions to generate neuronal progenitor cells that can proliferate further. We also show that inhibition of Notch signalling in OSVZ progenitor cells induces their neuronal differentiation. The establishment of non-ventricular radial glia-like cells may have been a critical evolutionary advance underlying increased cortical size and complexity in the human brain.","[Hansen, David V.; Lui, Jan H.; Parker, Philip R.

The resonant nature of the line, however, means that Ly alpha photons scatter in the neutral interstellar medium of their host galaxies, and their sensitivity to absorption by interstellar dust may therefore be greatly enhanced. This implies that the Ly alpha luminosity may be significantly reduced, or even completely suppressed. Hitherto, no unbiased empirical test of the escaping fraction (f(esc)) of Ly alpha photons has been performed at high redshifts. Here we report that the average f(esc) from star-forming galaxies at redshift z=2.2 is just 5 per cent by performing a blind narrowband survey in Ly alpha and H alpha. This implies that numerous conclusions based on Ly alpha-selected samples will require upwards revision by an order of magnitude and we provide a benchmark for this revision. We demonstrate that almost 90 per cent of star-forming galaxies emit insufficient Ly alpha to be detected by standard selection criteria(2-5). Both samples show an anti-correlation of f(esc) with dust content, and we show that Ly alpha- and H alpha-selection recovers populations that differ substantially in dust content and f(esc).","[Hayes, Matthew; Schaerer, Daniel; de Barros, Stephane] Univ Geneva, Astron Observ, CH-1290 Sauverny, Switzerland; [Ostlin, Goran; Melinder, Jens] Stockholm Univ, AlbaNova Univ Ctr, Dept Astron, Oskar Klein Ctr, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Schaerer, Daniel] Univ Toulouse, CNRS, Lab Astrophys Toulouse Tarbes, F-31400 Toulouse, France; [Miguel Mas-Hesse, J.] Ctr Astrobiol CSIC INTA, Madrid 28691, Spain; [Leitherer, Claus] Space Telescope Sci Inst, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Atek, Hakim; Kunth, Daniel] IAP, F-75014 Paris, France; [Verhamme, Anne] Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Oxford OX1 3RH, England","Hayes, M (reprint author), Univ Geneva, Astron Observ, 51 Chemin Maillettes, CH-1290 Sauverny, Switzerland.",matthew.hayes@unige.ch,"Hayes, Matthew/D-6692-2014; Mas-Hesse, J.

Coulomb interactions break the degeneracy of the Landau levels and can cause the electrons to order into complex ground states. Here we observe, in the high energy single particle spectrum of this system, salient and unexpected structure that extends across a wide range of Landau level filling fractions. The structure appears only when the two-dimensional electron system is cooled to very low temperatures, indicating that it arises from delicate ground state correlations. We characterize this structure by its evolution with changing electron density and applied magnetic field, and present two possible models for understanding these observations. Some of the energies of the features agree qualitatively with what might be expected for composite fermions, which have proven effective for interpreting other experiments in this regime. At the same time, a simple model with electrons localized on ordered lattice sites also generates structure similar to that observed in the experiment. Neither of these models alone is sufficient to explain the observations across the entire range of densities measured. The discovery of this unexpected prominent structure in the single particle spectrum of an otherwise thoroughly studied system suggests that there exist core features of the two-dimensional electron system that have yet to be understood.","[Dial, O.

Transmission electron microscopy should in principle be able to fulfil this role, as many scientists including Feynman realized early on(1). It images matter with electrons that scatter strongly from individual atoms and whose wavelengths are about 50 times smaller than an atom. Recently the technique has advanced greatly owing to the introduction of aberration-corrected optics(2-8). However, neither electron microscopy nor any other experimental technique has yet been able to resolve and identify all the atoms in a non-periodic material consisting of several atomic species. Here we show that annular dark-field imaging in an aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope optimized for low voltage operation can resolve and identify the chemical type of every atom in monolayer hexagonal boron nitride that contains substitutional defects. Three types of atomic substitutions were found and identified: carbon substituting for boron, carbon substituting for nitrogen, and oxygen substituting for nitrogen. The substitutions caused in-plane distortions in the boron nitride monolayer of about 0.1 angstrom magnitude, which were directly resolved, and verified by density functional theory calculations. The results demonstrate that atom-by-atom structural and chemical analysis of all radiation-damage-resistant atoms present in, and on top of, ultrathin sheets has now become possible.","[Krivanek, Ondrej L.; Corbin, George J.; Dellby, Niklas; Murfitt, Matthew F.; Own, Christopher S.; Szilagyi, Zoltan S.] Nion Co, Kirkland, WA 98033 USA; [Chisholm, Matthew F.; Pennycook, Timothy J.; Oxley, Mark P.; Pantelides, Sokrates T.; Pennycook, Stephen J.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci & Technol, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Nicolosi, Valeria] Univ Oxford, Dept Mat, Oxford OX1 3PH, England; [Pennycook, Timothy J.; Oxley, Mark P.; Pantelides, Sokrates T.; Pennycook, Stephen J.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Nashville, TN 37235 USA","Krivanek, OL (reprint author), Nion Co, 1102 8th St, Kirkland, WA 98033 USA.",krivanek@nion.com,"Pennycook, Timothy/B-4946-2014; Chisholm, Matthew/F-7198-2017; Oxley, Mark/F-8737-2017","Pennycook, Timothy/0000-0002-0008-6516; Chisholm, Matthew/0000-0003-0546-5109; Oxley, Mark/0000-0002-9588-6187",Division of Materials Sciences and Engineering of the US Department of Energy [DE-FG02-09ER46554]; McMinn Endowment,"We thank L.

J.",,,Lock and key colloids,NATURE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,DNA; CRYSTALLIZATION,"New functional materials can in principle be created using colloids that self-assemble into a desired structure by means of a programmable recognition and binding scheme. This idea has been explored by attaching 'programmed' DNA strands to nanometre-(1-3) and micrometre-(4,5) sized particles and then using DNA hybridization to direct the placement of the particles in the final assembly. Here we demonstrate an alternative recognition mechanism for directing the assembly of composite structures, based on particles with complementary shapes. Our system, which uses Fischer's lock-and-key principle(6), employs colloidal spheres as keys and monodisperse colloidal particles with a spherical cavity as locks that bind spontaneously and reversibly via the depletion interaction. The lock-and-key binding is specific because it is controlled by how closely the size of a spherical colloidal key particle matches the radius of the spherical cavity of the lock particle. The strength of the binding can be further tuned by adjusting the solution composition or temperature. The composite assemblies have the unique feature of having flexible bonds, allowing us to produce flexible dimeric, trimeric and tetrameric colloidal molecules as well as more complex colloidal polymers. We expect that this lock-and-key recognition mechanism will find wider use as a means of programming and directing colloidal self-assembly.","[Sacanna, S.; Irvine, W. T. M.; Chaikin, P. M.; Pine, D.

However, the dynamics of R(S) are not well understood and the global flux remains poorly constrained(4,5). Ecosystem warming experiments(6,7), modelling analyses(8,9) and fundamental biokinetics(10) all suggest that R(S) should change with climate. This has been difficult to confirm observationally because of the high spatial variability of R(S), inaccessibility of the soil medium and the inability of remote-sensing instruments to measure R(S) on large scales. Despite these constraints, it may be possible to discern climate-driven changes in regional or global R(S) values in the extant four-decade record of R(S) chamber measurements. Here we construct a database of worldwide R(S) observations matched with high-resolution historical climate data and find a previously unknown temporal trend in the R(S) record after accounting for mean annual climate, leaf area, nitrogen deposition and changes in CO(2) measurement technique. We find that the air temperature anomaly (the deviation from the 1961-1990 mean) is significantly and positively correlated with changes in R(S). We estimate that the global R(S) in 2008 (that is, the flux integrated over the Earth's land surface over 2008) was 98 +/- 12 Pg C and that it increased by 0.1 Pg C yr(-1) between 1989 and 2008, implying a global R(S) response to air temperature (Q(10)) of 1.5. An increasing global R(S) value does not necessarily constitute a positive feedback to the atmosphere, as it could be driven by higher carbon inputs to soil rather than by mobilization of stored older carbon. The available data are, however, consistent with an acceleration of the terrestrial carbon cycle in response to global climate change.","[Bond-Lamberty, Ben; Thomson, Allison] Univ Maryland, Pacific NW Natl Lab, Joint Global Change Res Inst, College Pk, MD 20740 USA","Bond-Lamberty, B (reprint author), Univ Maryland, Pacific NW Natl Lab, Joint Global Change Res Inst, 5825 Univ Res Court,Suite 3500, College Pk, MD 20740 USA.",bondlamberty@pnl.gov,"Thomson, Allison/B-1254-2010; Bond-Lamberty, Ben/C-6058-2008","Bond-Lamberty, Ben/0000-0001-9525-4633",US Department of Energy Office of Science; Pacific Northwest National Laboratory,This research was supported by the US Department of Energy Office of Science and the Laboratory Directed Research and Development program of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.

Whereas studies of development(5-7) and mathematical models of development(4,8-12) may offer new insights into the genotype-phenotype map, the challenge is to make them useful at the level of microevolution. Here we report a computational model of mammalian tooth development that combines parameters of genetic and cellular interactions to produce a three-dimensional tooth from a simple tooth primordia. We systematically tinkered with each of the model parameters to generate phenotypic variation and used geometric morphometric analyses to identify, or developmentally ordinate, parameters best explaining population-level variation of real teeth. To model the full range of developmentally possible morphologies, we used a population sample of ringed seals (Phoca hispida ladogensis)(13). Seal dentitions show a high degree of variation, typically linked to the lack of exact occlusion(13-16). Our model suggests that despite the complexity of development and teeth, there may be a simple basis for dental variation. Changes in single parameters regulating signalling during cusp development may explain shape variation among individuals, whereas a parameter regulating epithelial growth may explain serial, tooth-to-tooth variation along the jaw. Our study provides a step towards integrating the genotype, development and the phenotype.","[Salazar-Ciudad, Isaac] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Genet & Microbiol, Fac Biociencies, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Salazar-Ciudad, Isaac; Jernvall, Jukka] Univ Helsinki, Inst Biotechnol, Dev Biol Program, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Jernvall, Jukka] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA","Salazar-Ciudad, I (reprint author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Genet & Microbiol, Fac Biociencies, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain.",isaac.salazar@uab.cat; jernvall@fastmail.fm,,"Salazar, Isaac/0000-0003-1607-0962",Ramon y Cajal Program [RYC-2007-00149]; Academy of Finland,"We thank I.

They have evolved genetic adaptations to a new environment, the farm, and have been subjected to strong human-driven selection leading to remarkable phenotypic changes in morphology, physiology and behaviour. Identifying the genetic changes underlying these developments provides new insight into general mechanisms by which genetic variation shapes phenotypic diversity. Here we describe the use of massively parallel sequencing to identify selective sweeps of favourable alleles and candidate mutations that have had a prominent role in the domestication of chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) and their subsequent specialization into broiler (meat-producing) and layer (egg-producing) chickens. We have generated 44.5-fold coverage of the chicken genome using pools of genomic DNA representing eight different populations of domestic chickens as well as red jungle fowl (Gallus gallus), the major wild ancestor(4). We report more than 7,000,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms, almost 1,300 deletions and a number of putative selective sweeps. One of the most striking selective sweeps found in all domestic chickens occurred at the locus for thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR), which has a pivotal role in metabolic regulation and photoperiod control of reproduction in vertebrates. Several of the selective sweeps detected in broilers overlapped genes associated with growth, appetite and metabolic regulation. We found little evidence that selection for loss-of-function mutations had a prominent role in chicken domestication, but we detected two deletions in coding sequences that we suggest are functionally important. This study has direct application to animal breeding and enhances the importance of the domestic chicken as a model organism for biomedical research.","[Rubin, Carl-Johan; Zody, Michael C.; Eriksson, Jonas; Meadows, Jennifer R.

We also report the sequence of the genome of a novel bacterium stably associated with H. magnipapillata. Comparisons of the Hydra genome to the genomes of other animals shed light on the evolution of epithelia, contractile tissues, developmentally regulated transcription factors, the Spemann-Mangold organizer, pluripotency genes and the neuromuscular junction.","[Blumberg, Bruce; Dana, Catherine E.; Gee, Lydia; Law, Lee; Lindgens, Dirk; Peng, Jisong; Bode, Hans R.; Steele, Robert E.] Univ Calif Irvine, Ctr Dev Biol, Irvine, CA 92717 USA; [Chapman, Jarrod A.; Goodstein, David M.; Hellsten, Uffe; Prochnik, Simon E.; Putnam, Nicholas H.; Shu, Shengquiang] US DOE, Joint Genome Inst, Walnut Creek, CA 94598 USA; [Kirkness, Ewen F.; Borman, Jon; Busam, Dana; Disbennett, Kathryn; Pfannkoch, Cynthia; Sumin, Nadezhda; Sutton, Granger G.; Viswanathan, Lakshmi Devi; Walenz, Brian; Remington, Karin A.; Strausberg, Robert L.; Venter, J.

Reactive electrophiles are a class of noxious compounds humans find pungent and irritating, such as allyl isothiocyanate (in wasabi) and acrolein ( in cigarette smoke)(1-3). Diverse animals, from insects to humans, find reactive electrophiles aversive(1-3), but whether this reflects conservation of an ancient sensory modality has been unclear. Here we identify the molecular basis of reactive electrophile detection in flies. We demonstrate that Drosophila TRPA1 (Transient receptor potential A1), the Drosophila melanogaster orthologue of the human irritant sensor, acts in gustatory chemosensors to inhibit reactive electrophile ingestion. We show that fly and mosquito TRPA1 orthologues are molecular sensors of electrophiles, using a mechanism conserved with vertebrate TRPA1s. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that invertebrate and vertebrate TRPA1s share a common ancestor that possessed critical characteristics required for electrophile detection. These findings support emergence of TRPA1-based electrophile detection in a common bilaterian ancestor, with widespread conservation throughout vertebrate and invertebrate evolution. Such conservation contrasts with the evolutionary divergence of canonical olfactory and gustatory receptors and may relate to electrophile toxicity. We propose that human pain perception relies on an ancient chemical sensor conserved across similar to 500 million years of animal evolution.","[Kang, Kyeongjin; Pulver, Stefan R.; Panzano, Vincent C.; Chang, Elaine C.; Griffith, Leslie C.; Garrity, Paul A.] Brandeis Univ, Natl Ctr Behav Genom, Waltham, MA 02454 USA; [Kang, Kyeongjin; Pulver, Stefan R.; Panzano, Vincent C.; Chang, Elaine C.; Griffith, Leslie C.; Garrity, Paul A.] Brandeis Univ, Volen Ctr Complex Syst, Dept Biol, Waltham, MA 02454 USA; [Theobald, Douglas L.] Brandeis Univ, Dept Biochem, Waltham, MA 02454 USA","Garrity, PA (reprint author), Brandeis Univ, Natl Ctr Behav Genom, Waltham, MA 02454 USA.",pgarrity@brandeis.edu,"babakinejad, babak/G-2674-2012; Theobald, Douglas/F-3514-2013","Theobald, Douglas/0000-0002-2695-8343; Griffith, Leslie/0000-0003-3164-9876; Kang, KyeongJin/0000-0003-0446-469X","NIMH [R21 MH080206, RO1 MH067284]; NINDS [PO1 NS044232]; Royal Society","We thank H.

Yet, there is little or no significant cardiac muscle regeneration after an injury such as acute myocardial infarction(3). By contrast, zebrafish efficiently regenerate lost cardiac muscle, providing a model for understanding how natural heart regeneration may be blocked or enhanced(4,5). In the absence of lineage-tracing technology applicable to adult zebrafish, the cellular origins of newly regenerated cardiac muscle have remained unclear. Using new genetic fate-mapping approaches, here we identify a population of cardiomyocytes that become activated after resection of the ventricular apex and contribute prominently to cardiac muscle regeneration. Through the use of a transgenic reporter strain, we found that cardiomyocytes throughout the subepicardial ventricular layer trigger expression of the embryonic cardiogenesis gene gata4 within a week of trauma, before expression localizes to proliferating cardiomyocytes surrounding and within the injury site. Cre-recombinase-based lineage-tracing of cells expressing gata4 before evident regeneration, or of cells expressing the contractile gene cmlc2 before injury, each labelled most cardiac muscle in the ensuing regenerate. By optical voltage mapping of surface myocardium in whole ventricles, we found that electrical conduction is re-established between existing and regenerated cardiomyocytes between 2 and 4 weeks post-injury. After injury and prolonged fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibition to arrest cardiac regeneration and enable scar formation, experimental release of the signalling block led to gata4 expression and morphological improvement of the injured ventricular wall without loss of scar tissue. Our results indicate that electrically coupled cardiac muscle regenerates after resection injury, primarily through activation and expansion of cardiomyocyte populations. These findings have implications for promoting regeneration of the injured human heart.","[Kikuchi, Kazu; Holdway, Jennifer E.; Fang, Yi; Egnaczyk, Gregory F.; Poss, Kenneth D.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Cell Biol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Kikuchi, Kazu; Holdway, Jennifer E.; Fang, Yi; Egnaczyk, Gregory F.; Poss, Kenneth D.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Egnaczyk, Gregory F.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Med, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Werdich, Andreas A.; MacRae, Calum A.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Cardiovasc, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Anderson, Ryan M.; Stainier, Didier Y.

In contrast to mammals, several non-mammalian vertebrate species are able to regenerate their hearts(1-3), including the zebrafish(4,5), which can fully regenerate its heart after amputation of up to 20% of the ventricle. To address directly the source of newly formed cardiomyocytes during zebrafish heart regeneration, we first established a genetic strategy to trace the lineage of cardiomyocytes in the adult fish, on the basis of the Cre/lox system widely used in the mouse(6). Here we use this system to show that regenerated heart muscle cells are derived from the proliferation of differentiated cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, we show that proliferating cardiomyocytes undergo limited dedifferentiation characterized by the disassembly of their sarcomeric structure, detachment from one another and the expression of regulators of cell-cycle progression. Specifically, we show that the gene product of polo-like kinase 1 (plk1) is an essential component of cardiomyocyte proliferation during heart regeneration. Our data provide the first direct evidence for the source of proliferating cardiomyocytes during zebrafish heart regeneration and indicate that stem or progenitor cells are not significantly involved in this process.","[Jopling, Chris; Sleep, Eduard; Raya, Marina; Marti, Merce; Raya, Angel; Izpisua Belmonte, Juan Carlos] Ctr Regenerat Med Barcelona, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Sleep, Eduard; Raya, Angel; Izpisua Belmonte, Juan Carlos] Networking Ctr Biomed Res Bioengn Biomat & Nanome, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Raya, Angel] ICREA, Barcelona 08010, Spain; [Izpisua Belmonte, Juan Carlos] Salk Inst Biol Studies, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Belmonte, JCI (reprint author), Ctr Regenerat Med Barcelona, Dr Aiguader St 88, Barcelona 08003, Spain.",belmonte@salk.edu,"Raya, Angel/E-6205-2010","Raya, Angel/0000-0003-2189-9775","Ministry of Innovation, Universities and Enterprise (DIUE), Generalitat de Catalunya; Fundacion Cellex; Ipsen Foundation; G.

Moreover, the frequency of heteroplasmic variants varied considerably between different tissues in the same individual. In addition to the variants identified in normal tissues, cancer cells harboured further homoplasmic and heteroplasmic mutations that could also be detected in patient plasma. These studies provide insights into the nature and variability of mtDNA sequences and have implications for mitochondrial processes during embryogenesis, cancer biomarker development and forensic analysis.

Haploids generated from a heterozygous individual and converted to diploid create instant homozygous lines, bypassing generations of inbreeding. Two methods are generally used to produce haploids. First, cultured gametophyte cells may be regenerated into haploid plants(4), but many species and genotypes are recalcitrant to this process(2,5). Second, haploids can be induced from rare interspecific crosses, in which one parental genome is eliminated after fertilization(6-11). The molecular basis for genome elimination is not understood, but one theory posits that centromeres from the two parent species interact unequally with the mitotic spindle, causing selective chromosome loss(12-14). Here we show that haploid Arabidopsis thaliana plants can be easily generated through seeds by manipulating a single centromere protein, the centromere-specific histone CENH3 (called CENP-A in human). When cenh3 null mutants expressing altered CENH3 proteins are crossed to wild type, chromosomes from the mutant are eliminated, producing haploid progeny. Haploids are spontaneously converted into fertile diploids through meiotic non-reduction, allowing their genotype to be perpetuated. Maternal and paternal haploids can be generated through reciprocal crosses. We have also exploited centromere-mediated genome elimination to convert a natural tetraploid Arabidopsis into a diploid, reducing its ploidy to simplify breeding. As CENH3 is universal in eukaryotes, our method may be extended to produce haploids in any plant species.","[Ravi, Maruthachalam; Chan, Simon W.

The differentiation of committed preadipocytes to adipocytes is controlled by PPAR gamma and several other transcription factors(1), but the molecular basis for preadipocyte determination is not understood. Using a new method for the quantitative analysis of transcriptional components, we identified the zinc-finger protein Zfp423 as a factor enriched in preadipose versus non-preadipose fibroblasts. Ectopic expression of Zfp423 in non-adipogenic NIH 3T3 fibroblasts robustly activates expression of Pparg in undifferentiated cells and permits cells to undergo adipocyte differentiation under permissive conditions. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated reduction of Zfp423 expression in 3T3-L1 cells blunts preadipocyte Pparg expression and diminishes the ability of these cells to differentiate. Furthermore, both brown and white adipocyte differentiation is markedly impaired in Zfp423-deficient mouse embryos. Zfp423 regulates Pparg expression, in part, through amplification of the BMP signalling pathway, an effect dependent on the SMAD-binding capacity of Zfp423. This study identifies Zfp423 as a transcriptional regulator of preadipocyte determination.","[Gupta, Rana K.; Arany, Zoltan; Seale, Patrick; Mepani, Rina J.; Ye, Li; Conroe, Heather M.; Spiegelman, Bruce M.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Gupta, Rana K.; Arany, Zoltan; Seale, Patrick; Mepani, Rina J.; Ye, Li; Conroe, Heather M.; Spiegelman, Bruce M.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Div Metab & Chron Dis, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Gupta, Rana K.; Arany, Zoltan; Seale, Patrick; Mepani, Rina J.; Ye, Li; Conroe, Heather M.; Spiegelman, Bruce M.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Roby, Yang A.; Kulaga, Heather; Reed, Randall R.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, Ctr Sensory Biol,Dept Mol Biol & Genet, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Spiegelman, BM (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Biol, 44 Binney St, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",bruce_spiegelman@dfci.harvard.edu,,,"Ruth Kirstein NRSA [F32 DK079507-01]; NHLBI [K08 HL79172-01]; Smith Family Foundation; NIH [DK081605, DK31405]; NIDCD [R01DC008295]","We are grateful to S.

Recent studies showed that p53 activation mediated by ARF, but not that induced by DNA damage, acts as a major protection against tumorigenesis in vivo under certain biological settings(7,8), suggesting that the ARF-p53 axis has more fundamental functions in tumour suppression than originally thought. Because ARF is a very stable protein in most human cell lines, it has been widely assumed that ARF induction is mediated mainly at the transcriptional level and that activation of the ARF-p53 pathway by oncogenes is a much slower and largely irreversible process by comparison with p53 activation after DNA damage. Here we report that ARF is very unstable in normal human cells but that its degradation is inhibited in cancerous cells. Through biochemical purification, we identified a specific ubiquitin ligase for ARF and named it ULF. ULF interacts with ARF both in vitro and in vivo and promotes the lysine-independent ubiquitylation and degradation of ARF. ULF knockdown stabilizes ARF in normal human cells, triggering ARF-dependent, p53-mediated growth arrest. Moreover, nucleophosmin (NPM) and c-Myc, both of which are commonly overexpressed in cancer cells, are capable of abrogating ULF-mediated ARF ubiquitylation through distinct mechanisms, and thereby promote ARF stabilization in cancer cells. These findings reveal the dynamic feature of the ARF-p53 pathway and suggest that transcription-independent mechanisms are critically involved in ARF regulation during responses to oncogenic stress.","[Chen, Delin; Shan, Jing; Gu, Wei] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Inst Canc Genet, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Chen, Delin; Shan, Jing; Gu, Wei] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Pathol & Cell Biol, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Zhu, Wei-Guo] Peking Univ, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Qin, Jun] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Biochem & Cell Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Gu, W (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Inst Canc Genet, 1130 St Nicholas Ave, New York, NY 10032 USA.",wg8@columbia.edu,"zhu, wei-guo/E-1334-2012","Zhu, Wei-Guo/0000-0001-8385-6581",National Institutes of Health/National Cancer Institute; Leukemia and Lymphoma Society; NSFC [30628028],"We thank R.

Because some mutants and certain sexual species exhibit more than one MMC(2-4), and many others are able to form gametes without meiosis (by apomixis)(5), it has been suggested that somatic cells in the ovule are competent to respond to a local signal likely to have an important function in determination(6). Here we show that the Arabidopsis protein ARGONAUTE 9 (AGO9) controls female gamete formation by restricting the specification of gameto-phyte precursors in a dosage-dependent, non-cell-autonomous manner. Mutations in AGO9 lead to the differentiation of multiple gametic cells that are able to initiate gametogenesis. The AGO9 protein is not expressed in the gamete lineage; instead, it is expressed in cytoplasmic foci of somatic companion cells. Mutations in SUPPRESSOR OF GENE SILENCING 3 and RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 6 exhibit an identical defect to ago9 mutants, indicating that the movement of small RNA (sRNAs) silencing out of somatic companion cells is necessary for controlling the specification of gametic cells. AGO9 preferentially interacts with 24-nucleotide sRNAs derived from transposable elements (TEs), and its activity is necessary to silence TEs in female gametes and their accessory cells. Our results show that AGO9-dependent sRNA silencing is crucial to specify cell fate in the Arabidopsis ovule, and that epigenetic reprogramming in companion cells is necessary for sRNA-dependent silencing in plant gametes.","[Olmedo-Monfil, Vianey; Duran-Figueroa, Noe; Arteaga-Vazquez, Mario; Demesa-Arevalo, Edgar; Vielle-Calzada, Jean-Philippe] Cinvestav Irapuato, Lab Nacl Genom Biodiversidad, Grp Desarrollo Reprod & Apomixis, Guanajuato 36500, Mexico; [Olmedo-Monfil, Vianey; Duran-Figueroa, Noe; Arteaga-Vazquez, Mario; Demesa-Arevalo, Edgar; Vielle-Calzada, Jean-Philippe] Cinvestav Irapuato, Dept Ingn Genet Plantas, Guanajuato 36500, Mexico; [Autran, Daphne; Grimanelli, Daniel] Inst Rech Dev, UMR 5096, F-34394 Montpellier, France; [Slotkin, R.

To understand the molecular underpinnings of pathogenicity in the genus Fusarium, we compared the genomes of three phenotypically diverse species: Fusarium graminearum, Fusarium verticillioides and Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici. Our analysis revealed lineage-specific (LS) genomic regions in F. oxysporum that include four entire chromosomes and account for more than one-quarter of the genome. LS regions are rich in transposons and genes with distinct evolutionary profiles but related to pathogenicity, indicative of horizontal acquisition. Experimentally, we demonstrate the transfer of two LS chromosomes between strains of F. oxysporum, converting a non-pathogenic strain into a pathogen. Transfer of LS chromosomes between otherwise genetically isolated strains explains the polyphyletic origin of host specificity and the emergence of new pathogenic lineages in F. oxysporum. These findings put the evolution of fungal pathogenicity into a new perspective.","[Breakspear, Andrew; Gale, Liane R.; Hilburn, Karen; Kistler, H.

Senescence induced by oncogenes or by loss of tumour suppressor genes is thought to critically depend on induction of the p19(Arf)-p53 pathway. The Skp2 E3-ubiquitin ligase can act as a proto-oncogene and its aberrant overexpression is frequently observed in human cancers. Here we show that although Skp2 inactivation on its own does not induce cellular senescence, aberrant proto-oncogenic signals as well as inactivation of tumour suppressor genes do trigger a potent, tumour-suppressive senescence response in mice and cells devoid of Skp2. Notably, Skp2 inactivation and oncogenic-stress-driven senescence neither elicit activation of the p19(Arf)-p53 pathway nor DNA damage, but instead depend on Atf4, p27 and p21. We further demonstrate that genetic Skp2 inactivation evokes cellular senescence even in oncogenic conditions in which the p19(Arf)-p53 response is impaired, whereas a Skp2-SCF complex inhibitor can trigger cellular senescence in p53/Pten-deficient cells and tumour regression in preclinical studies. Our findings therefore provide proof-of-principle evidence that pharmacological inhibition of Skp2 may represent a general approach for cancer prevention and therapy.","[Lin, Hui-Kuan; Chen, Zhenbang; Wang, Guocan; Nardella, Caterina; Pandolfi, Pier Paolo] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Sloan Kettering Inst, Canc Biol & Genet Program, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Lin, Hui-Kuan; Chen, Zhenbang; Wang, Guocan; Nardella, Caterina; Cordon-Cardo, Carlos; Teruya-Feldstein, Julie; Pandolfi, Pier Paolo] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Sloan Kettering Inst, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Lin, Hui-Kuan; Lee, Szu-Wei; Chan, Chan-Hsin; Yang, Wei-Lei; Wang, Jing] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Mol & Cellular Oncol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Chen, Zhenbang; Wang, Guocan; Nardella, Caterina; Egia, Ainara] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Chen, Zhenbang; Wang, Guocan; Nardella, Caterina; Egia, Ainara] Beth Israel Deaconess Canc Ctr, Canc Genet Program, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Nakayama, Keiichi I.] Kyushu Univ, Med Inst Bioregulat, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Fukuoka 8128582, Japan","Pandolfi, PP (reprint author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Sloan Kettering Inst, Canc Biol & Genet Program, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA.",ppandolf@bidmc.harvard.edu,"Wang, Guocan/F-1530-2011; Chan, Chia-Hsin/F-2272-2011; Yang, Wei-Lei/E-2598-2012",,NIH; Anderson Trust Scholar Award; DOD Prostate Cancer New Investigator Award,"We are grateful to C.

This puzzling result suggests that these distant quasars are evolved objects even though the Universe was only seven per cent of its current age at these redshifts. Recently one z approximate to 6 quasar was shown not to have any detectable emission from hot dust(4), but it was unclear whether that indicated different hot-dust properties at high redshift or if it is simply an outlier. Here we report the discovery of a second quasar without hot-dust emission in a sample of 21 z approximate to 6 quasars. Such apparently hot-dust-free quasars have no counterparts at low redshift. Moreover, we demonstrate that the hot-dust abundance in the 21 quasars builds up in tandem with the growth of the central black hole, whereas at low redshift it is almost independent of the black hole mass. Thus z approximate to 6 quasars are indeed at an early evolutionary stage, with rapid mass accretion and dust formation. The two hot-dust-free quasars are likely to be first-generation quasars born in dust-free environments and are too young to have formed a detectable amount of hot dust around them.","[Jiang, Linhua; Fan, Xiaohui; Egami, Eiichi; Vestergaard, Marianne] Univ Arizona, Steward Observ, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Fan, Xiaohui; Kurk, Jaron D.; Walter, Fabian] Max Planck Inst Astron, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Brandt, W.

Some short-period planets(2), including the first terrestrial exoplanet(3,4) (CoRoT-7b), have been discovered using a space mission(5) designed to find smaller and more distant planets than can be seen from the ground. Here we report transit observations of CoRoT-9b, which orbits with a period of 95.274 days on a low eccentricity of 0.11 +/- 0.04 around a solar-like star. Its periastron distance of 0.36 astronomical units is by far the largest of all transiting planets, yielding a 'temperate' photospheric temperature estimated to be between 250 and 430 K. Unlike previously known transiting planets, the present size of CoRoT-9b should not have been affected by tidal heat dissipation processes. Indeed, the planet is found to be well described by standard evolution models(6) with an inferred interior composition consistent with that of Jupiter and Saturn.","[Deeg, H.

Many-body effects have been explored with hundreds of thousands of quantum-degenerate neutral atoms(1), and coherent light-matter interfaces have been built(2,3). Systems of single or a few trapped ions have been used to demonstrate universal quantum computing algorithms(4) and to search for variations of fundamental constants in precision atomic clocks(5). Until now, atomic quantum gases and single trapped ions have been treated separately in experiments. Here we investigate whether they can be advantageously combined into one hybrid system, by exploring the immersion of a single trapped ion into a Bose-Einstein condensate of neutral atoms. We demonstrate independent control over the two components of the hybrid system, study the fundamental interaction processes and observe sympathetic cooling of the single ion by the condensate. Our experiment calls for further research into the possibility of using this technique for the continuous cooling of quantum computers(6). We also anticipate that it will lead to explorations of entanglement in hybrid quantum systems and to fundamental studies of the decoherence of a single, locally controlled impurity particle coupled to a quantum environment(7,8).","[Zipkes, Christoph; Palzer, Stefan; Sias, Carlo; Koehl, Michael] Univ Cambridge, Cavendish Lab, Cambridge CB3 0HE, England","Kohl, M (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Cavendish Lab, JJ Thomson Ave, Cambridge CB3 0HE, England.",mk540@cam.ac.uk,"Kohl, Michael/C-6114-2009; Palzer, Stefan/A-8167-2013; Sias, Carlo/D-1317-2014","Kohl, Michael/0000-0003-4055-713X; Palzer, Stefan/0000-0003-2109-1936; Sias, Carlo/0000-0002-5390-8288",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; European Research Council [240335]; Herchel Smith Fund,"We are grateful to N.

However, generally substrates based on metals such as Ag, Au and Cu, either with roughened surfaces or in the form of nanoparticles, are required to realise a substantial SERS effect, and this has severely limited the breadth of practical applications of SERS. A number of approaches have extended the technique to non-traditional substrates(14,16,17), most notably tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS)(18-20) where the probed substance (molecule or material surface) can be on a generic substrate and where a nanoscale gold tip above the substrate acts as the Raman signal amplifier. The drawback is that the total Raman scattering signal from the tip area is rather weak, thus limiting TERS studies to molecules with large Raman cross-sections. Here, we report an approach, which we name shell-isolated nanoparticle-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, in which the Raman signal amplification is provided by gold nanoparticles with an ultrathin silica or alumina shell. A monolayer of such nanoparticles is spread as 'smart dust' over the surface that is to be probed. The ultrathin coating keeps the nanoparticles from agglomerating, separates them from direct contact with the probed material and allows the nanoparticles to conform to different contours of substrates. High-quality Raman spectra were obtained on various molecules adsorbed at Pt and Au single-crystal surfaces and from Si surfaces with hydrogen monolayers. These measurements and our studies on yeast cells and citrus fruits with pesticide residues illustrate that our method significantly expands the flexibility of SERS for useful applications in the materials and life sciences, as well as for the inspection of food safety, drugs, explosives and environment pollutants.","[Li, Jian Feng; Huang, Yi Fan; Yang, Zhi Lin; Li, Song Bo; Zhou, Xiao Shun; Fan, Feng Ru; Zhang, Wei; Zhou, Zhi You; Wu, De Yin; Ren, Bin; Tian, Zhong Qun] Xiamen Univ, State Key Lab Phys Chem Solid Surfaces, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China; [Li, Jian Feng; Huang, Yi Fan; Yang, Zhi Lin; Li, Song Bo; Zhou, Xiao Shun; Fan, Feng Ru; Zhang, Wei; Zhou, Zhi You; Wu, De Yin; Ren, Bin; Tian, Zhong Qun] Xiamen Univ, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China; [Ding, Yong; Fan, Feng Ru; Wang, Zhong Lin] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA","Tian, ZQ (reprint author), Xiamen Univ, State Key Lab Phys Chem Solid Surfaces, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China.",zhong.wang@mse.gatech.edu; zqtian@xmu.edu.cn,"Zhou, Xiao-Shun/C-3847-2008; Tian, ZQ/G-3411-2010; Yang, ZL/G-3971-2010; Wang, Zhong Lin/E-2176-2011; ZHOU, ZHIYOU/G-4690-2010; Li, Jian-Feng/J-5843-2015; Ding, Yong/F-3705-2017; Ren, Bin/G-4641-2010; Fan, Fengru/D-1422-2011; SKL, PCOSS/D-4395-2013; Wu, De Yin/G-4678-2010","Zhou, Xiao-Shun/0000-0003-1673-8125; Tian, ZQ/0000-0002-9775-8189; Wang, Zhong Lin/0000-0002-5530-0380; Li, Jian-Feng/0000-0003-1598-6856; Ding, Yong/0000-0001-5805-347X; Ren, Bin/0000-0002-9821-5864; Fan, Fengru/0000-0001-6474-471X; ","MOST, China [2009CB930703, 2007DFC40440, 2007CB935603]; NSF of China [20620130427, 20533040]; BES DOE [DE-FG02-07ER46394]; US NSF [DMS 0706436, CMMI 0403671]","We thank P.

A significant hurdle in studying thermal diffusion has been the difficulty of characterizing it. Extensive experiments over the past century have established that the Soret coefficient, S(T) (a single parameter that describes the steady-state result of thermal diffusion), is highly sensitive to many factors(3-9). This sensitivity makes it very difficult to obtain a robust characterization of thermal diffusion, even for a single material. Here we show that for thermal diffusion experiments that span a wide range in composition and temperature, the difference in ST between isotopes of diffusing elements that are network modifiers ( iron, calcium and magnesium) is independent of the composition and temperature. On the basis of this finding, we propose an additive decomposition for the functional form of ST and argue that a theoretical approach based on local thermodynamic equilibrium(3,5,10) holds promise for describing thermal diffusion in silicate melts and other complex solutions. Our results lead to a simple and robust framework for characterizing isotope fractionation by thermal diffusion in natural and synthetic systems.","[Huang, F.; Chakraborty, P.; Lundstrom, C.

In many syngnathid species, males brood their offspring in a specialized pouch, which presumably evolved to facilitate male parental care(5,6). However, an unexplored possibility is that brood pouch evolution was partly shaped by parent-offspring or sexual conflict, processes that would result in trade-offs between current and future pregnancies. Here we report a controlled breeding experiment using the sexually dimorphic Gulf pipefish, Syngnathus scovelli, to test for post-copulatory sexual selection within broods and for trade-offs between successive male pregnancies as functions of female attractiveness. Offspring survivorship within a pregnancy was affected by the size of a male's mate, the number of eggs transferred and the male's sexual responsiveness. Significantly, we also found that embryo survivorship in a current pregnancy was negatively related to survivorship in the prior pregnancy, clearly demonstrating fitness trade-offs between broods. Overall, our data indicate that post-copulatory sexual selection and sexual conflict occur in Gulf pipefishes. The conflict seems to be mediated by a strategy of cryptic choice in which males increase rates of offspring abortion in pregnancies from unattractive mothers to retain resources for future reproductive opportunities. Hence, the male brood pouch of syngnathid fishes, which nurtures offspring(7-9), also seems to have an important role as an arbiter of conflict between the sexes.","[Paczolt, Kimberly A.; Jones, Adam G.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Biol, College Stn, TX 77845 USA","Paczolt, KA (reprint author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Biol, 3258 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77845 USA.",kpaczolt@mail.bio.tamu.edu,,"Jones, Adam/0000-0003-0228-7124",US National Science Foundation [IOS-0455927],"This work was supported by grant IOS-0455927 from the US National Science Foundation.

The variants have a substantial effect on the epidemiology of CAD and other life-threatening vascular conditions because nearly one-quarter of Caucasians are homozygous for risk alleles. However, the risk interval is devoid of protein-coding genes and the mechanism linking the region to CAD risk has remained enigmatic. Here we show that deletion of the orthologous 70-kb non-coding interval on mouse chromosome 4 affects cardiac expression of neighbouring genes, as well as proliferation properties of vascular cells. Chr4(Delta 70kb/Delta 70kb) mice are viable, but show increased mortality both during development and as adults. Cardiac expression of two genes near the non-coding interval, Cdkn2a and Cdkn2b, is severely reduced in chr4(Delta 70kb/Delta 70kb) mice, indicating that distant-acting gene regulatory functions are located in the non-coding CAD risk interval. Allele-specific expression of Cdkn2b transcripts in heterozygous mice showed that the deletion affects expression through a cis-acting mechanism. Primary cultures of chr4(Delta 70kb/Delta 70kb) aortic smooth muscle cells exhibited excessive proliferation and diminished senescence, a cellular phenotype consistent with accelerated CAD pathogenesis. Taken together, our results provide direct evidence that the CAD risk interval has a pivotal role in regulation of cardiac Cdkn2a/b expression, and suggest that this region affects CAD progression by altering the dynamics of vascular cell proliferation.","[Visel, Axel; Zhu, Yiwen; May, Dalit; Afzal, Veena; Gong, Elaine; Attanasio, Catia; Blow, Matthew J.; Rubin, Edward M.; Pennacchio, Len A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Genom Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Visel, Axel; Blow, Matthew J.; Rubin, Edward M.; Pennacchio, Len A.] Joint Genome Inst, US DOE, Walnut Creek, CA 94598 USA; [Cohen, Jonathan C.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Internal Med, Dept Mol Genet, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Cohen, Jonathan C.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Ctr Human Nutr, Dallas, TX 75390 USA","Pennacchio, LA (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Genom Div, MS 84-171, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",LAPennacchio@lbl.gov,"Visel, Axel/A-9398-2009; Blow, Matthew/G-6369-2012; attanasio, catia/D-5042-2017","Visel, Axel/0000-0002-4130-7784; Blow, Matthew/0000-0002-8844-9149; attanasio, catia/0000-0001-8077-5719","National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; EMBO; Department of Energy, University of California [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; MMPC [DK59630]","We thank G.

Most strikingly, vasopressin and oxytocin, once thought of as circulating hormones whose actions were confined to peripheral organs, are now known to be released in the brain, where they have fundamentally important roles in social behaviours(1). In humans, disruptions of these peptide systems have been linked to several neurobehavioural disorders, including Prader-Willi syndrome, affective disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder, and polymorphisms of V1a vasopressin receptor have been linked to autism(2,3). Here we report that the rat olfactory bulb contains a large population of interneurons which express vasopressin, that blocking the actions of vasopressin in the olfactory bulb impairs the social recognition abilities of rats and that vasopressin agonists and antagonists can modulate the processing of information by olfactory bulb neurons. The findings indicate that social information is processed in part by a vasopressin system intrinsic to the olfactory system.","[Tobin, Vicky A.; Hashimoto, Hirofumi; Wacker, Douglas W.; Caquineau, Celine; Leng, Gareth; Meddle, Simone L.; Ludwig, Mike] Univ Edinburgh, Ctr Integrat Physiol, Edinburgh EH8 9XD, Midlothian, Scotland; [Takayanagi, Yuki; Onaka, Tatsushi] Jichi Med Univ, Dept Physiol, Shimotsuke, Tochigi 3290498, Japan; [Langnaese, Kristina; Noack, Julia; Engelmann, Mario] Otto VonGuericke Univ Magdegurg, Inst Biochem & Cell Biol, D-39120 Magdeburg, Germany; [Noack, Julia] Otto VonGuericke Univ Magdegurg, Ctr Cellular Imaging & Innovat Dis Models, D-39120 Magdeburg, Germany; [Landgraf, Rainer] Max Planck Inst Psychiat, D-80804 Munich, Germany; [Meddle, Simone L.] Univ Edinburgh, Roslin Inst, Roslin EH25 9PS, Midlothian, Scotland; [Meddle, Simone L.] Univ Edinburgh, Royal Dick Sch Vet Studies, Roslin EH25 9PS, Midlothian, Scotland","Ludwig, M (reprint author), Univ Edinburgh, Ctr Integrat Physiol, Edinburgh EH8 9XD, Midlothian, Scotland.",mike.ludwig@ed.ac.uk,"Leng, Gareth/C-6688-2011; Onaka, Tatsushi/I-7115-2012; Meddle, Simone/C-7748-2013","Leng, Gareth/0000-0002-2388-8466; Hashimoto, Hirofumi/0000-0003-1575-836X; ","Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council; Japan Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; German Academic Exchange Service/Academic Research Collaboration; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","We thank V.

In both kingdoms, recognition of pathogen- or microbe-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs or MAMPs, respectively), such as flagellin, initiates convergent signalling pathways involving mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK) cascades and global transcriptional changes to boost immunity(1-4). Although Ca2+ has long been recognized as an essential and conserved primary mediator in plant defence responses, how Ca2+ signals are sensed and relayed into early MAMP signalling is unknown(5,6). Using a functional genomic screen and genome-wide gene expression profiling, here we show that four calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are Ca2+-sensor protein kinases critical for transcriptional reprogramming in plant innate immune signalling. Unexpectedly, CDPKs and MAPK cascades act differentially in four MAMP-mediated regulatory programs to control early genes involved in the synthesis of defence peptides and metabolites, cell wall modifications and redox signalling. Transcriptome profile comparison suggests that CDPKs are the convergence point of signalling triggered by most MAMPs. Double, triple and quadruple cpk mutant plants display progressively diminished oxidative burst and gene activation induced by the 22-amino-acid peptide flg22, as well as compromised pathogen defence. In contrast to negative roles of calmodulin and a calmodulin-activated transcription factor in plant defence(7,8), the present study reveals Ca2+ signalling complexity and demonstrates key positive roles of specific CDPKs in initial MAMP signalling.","[Boudsocq, Marie; Willmann, Matthew R.; McCormack, Matthew; Lee, Horim; Shan, Libo; He, Ping; Bush, Jenifer; Cheng, Shu-Hua; Sheen, Jen] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Boudsocq, Marie; Willmann, Matthew R.; McCormack, Matthew; Lee, Horim; Shan, Libo; He, Ping; Bush, Jenifer; Cheng, Shu-Hua; Sheen, Jen] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Computat & Integrat Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Boudsocq, Marie; Willmann, Matthew R.; McCormack, Matthew; Lee, Horim; Shan, Libo; He, Ping; Bush, Jenifer; Cheng, Shu-Hua; Sheen, Jen] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Mol Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA","Boudsocq, M (reprint author), CNRS, UPR2355, Inst Sci Vegetal, 1 Ave Terrasse, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France.",boudsocq@molbio.mgh.harvard.edu; willmann@sas.upenn.edu,,"Willmann, Matthew R./0000-0002-4146-8158",European Community; NSF; National Science Foundation; National Institute of Health; MGH CCIB,"We thank K.

During Arabidopsis embryogenesis, establishment of the shoot and root stem cell populations occurs at opposite ends of an apical-basal axis. Recent work has identified the PLETHORA (PLT) genes as master regulators of basal/root fate(1-3), whereas the master regulators of apical/shoot fate have remained elusive. Here we show that the PLT1 and PLT2 genes are direct targets of the transcriptional co-repressor TOPLESS (TPL) and that PLT1/2 are necessary for the homeotic conversion of shoots to roots in tpl-1 mutants. Using tpl-1 as a genetic tool, we identify the CLASS III HOMEODOMAIN-LEUCINE ZIPPER (HD-ZIP III) transcription factors as master regulators of embryonic apical fate, and show they are sufficient to drive the conversion of the embryonic root pole into a second shoot pole. Furthermore, genetic and misexpression studies show an antagonistic relationship between the PLT and HD-ZIP III genes in specifying the root and shoot poles.","[Smith, Zachery R.; Long, Jeff A.] Univ Calif San Diego, Salk Inst Biol Studies, Plant Biol Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Smith, Zachery R.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Long, JA (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Salk Inst Biol Studies, Plant Biol Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",long@salk.edu,,,"Ray Thomas Edwards Foundation Career Development Award; National Institute of Health, NIGMS","We thank J.

We found that ATP-competitive RAF inhibitors inhibit ERK signalling in cells with mutant BRAF, but unexpectedly enhance signalling in cells with wild-type BRAF. Here we demonstrate the mechanistic basis for these findings. We used chemical genetic methods to show that drug-mediated transactivation of RAF dimers is responsible for paradoxical activation of the enzyme by inhibitors. Induction of ERK signalling requires direct binding of the drug to the ATP-binding site of one kinase of the dimer and is dependent on RAS activity. Drug binding to one member of RAF homodimers (CRAF-CRAF) or heterodimers (CRAF-BRAF) inhibits one protomer, but results in transactivation of the drug-free protomer. In BRAF(V600E) tumours, RAS is not activated, thus transactivation is minimal and ERK signalling is inhibited in cells exposed to RAF inhibitors. These results indicate that RAF inhibitors will be effective in tumours in which BRAF is mutated. Furthermore, because RAF inhibitors do not inhibit ERK signalling in other cells, the model predicts that they would have a higher therapeutic index and greater antitumour activity than mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitors, but could also cause toxicity due to MEK/ERK activation. These predictions have been borne out in a recent clinical trial of the RAF inhibitor PLX4032 (refs 4, 5). The model indicates that promotion of RAF dimerization by elevation of wild-type RAF expression or RAS activity could lead to drug resistance in mutant BRAF tumours. In agreement with this prediction, RAF inhibitors do not inhibit ERK signalling in cells that coexpress BRAF(V600E) and mutant RAS.","[Poulikakos, Poulikos I.; Rosen, Neal] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Program Mol Pharmacol & Chem, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Poulikakos, Poulikos I.; Rosen, Neal] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Med, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Zhang, Chao; Shokat, Kevan M.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Zhang, Chao; Shokat, Kevan M.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Cellular & Mol Pharmacol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Bollag, Gideon] Plexxikon Inc, Berkeley, CA 94710 USA","Rosen, N (reprint author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Program Mol Pharmacol & Chem, New York, NY 10065 USA.",rosenn@mskcc.org,,,Melanoma Research Alliance; Starr Cancer Consortium; NIH/NCI [1P01CA129243-02]; Joan's Legacy: United Against Lung Cancer Foundation; NIH [2R01EB001987]; The Children's Tumor Foundation; Waxman Foundation,"We are grateful to W.

Small molecule ATP-competitive RAF kinase inhibitors have potent antitumour effects on mutant BRAF(V600E) tumours but, in contrast to mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors, are not potent against RAS mutant tumour models, despite RAF functioning as a key effector downstream of RAS and upstream of MEK(2,3). Here we show that ATP-competitive RAF inhibitors have two opposing mechanisms of action depending on the cellular context. In BRAF(V600E) tumours, RAF inhibitors effectively block the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway and decrease tumour growth. Notably, in KRAS mutant and RAS/RAF wild-type tumours, RAF inhibitors activate the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway in a RAS-dependent manner, thus enhancing tumour growth in some xenograft models. Inhibitor binding activates wild-type RAF isoforms by inducing dimerization, membrane localization and interaction with RAS-GTP. These events occur independently of kinase inhibition and are, instead, linked to direct conformational effects of inhibitors on the RAF kinase domain. On the basis of these findings, we demonstrate that ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors can have opposing functions as inhibitors or activators of signalling pathways, depending on the cellular context.

This has led to the search for compounds that specifically target and inhibit oncogenes as anticancer agents. However, there has been no systematic exploration of whether chromosomal instability generated as a result of deregulation of the mitotic checkpoint pathway(2,3), a frequent characteristic of solid tumours, has any effect on oncogene addiction. Here we show that induction of chromosome instability by overexpression of the mitotic checkpoint gene Mad2 in mice does not affect the regression of Kras-driven lung tumours when Kras is inhibited. However, tumours that experience transient Mad2 overexpression and consequent chromosome instability recur at markedly elevated rates. The recurrent tumours are highly aneuploid and have varied activation of pro-proliferative pathways. Thus, early chromosomal instability may be responsible for tumour relapse after seemingly effective anticancer treatments.","[Sotillo, Rocio; Schvartzman, Juan-Manuel; Benezra, Robert] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Canc Biol & Genet Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Socci, Nicholas D.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Computat Biol Ctr, New York, NY 10065 USA","Benezra, R (reprint author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Canc Biol & Genet Program, New York, NY 10065 USA.",r-benezra@ski.mskcc.org,,"Sotillo, Rocio/0000-0002-0855-7917",Charles H.

The Methanococcus jannaschii tyrosyl-transfer-RNA synthetase-tRNA(CUA) (MjTyrRS-tRNA(CUA))(2,3) and the Methanosarcina barkeri pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase-tRNACUA (MbPylRS-tRNA(CUA))(4-6) orthogonal pairs have been evolved to incorporate a range of unnatural amino acids in response to the amber codon in Escherichia coli(1,6,7). However, the potential of synthetic genetic code expansion is generally limited to the low efficiency incorporation of a single type of unnatural amino acid at a time, because every triplet codon in the universal genetic code is used in encoding the synthesis of the proteome. To encode efficiently many distinct unnatural amino acids into proteins we require blank codons and mutually orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase-tRNA pairs that recognize unnatural amino acids and decode the new codons. Here we synthetically evolve an orthogonal ribosome(8,9) (ribo-Q1) that efficiently decodes a series of quadruplet codons and the amber codon, providing several blank codons on an orthogonal messenger RNA, which it specifically translates(8). By creating mutually orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase-tRNA pairs and combining them with ribo-Q1 we direct the incorporation of distinct unnatural amino acids in response to two of the new blank codons on the orthogonal mRNA. Using this code, we genetically direct the formation of a specific, redox-insensitive, nanoscale protein cross-link by the bio-orthogonal cycloaddition of encoded azide-and alkyne-containing amino acids(10). Because the synthetase-tRNA pairs used have been evolved to incorporate numerous unnatural amino acids(1,6,7), it will be possible to encode more than 200 unnatural amino acid combinations using this approach. As ribo-Q1 independently decodes a series of quadruplet codons, this work provides foundational technologies for the encoded synthesis and synthetic evolution of unnatural polymers in cells.","[Neumann, Heinz; Wang, Kaihang; Davis, Lloyd; Garcia-Alai, Maria; Chin, Jason W.] MRC, Mol Biol Lab, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England","Chin, JW (reprint author), MRC, Mol Biol Lab, Hills Rd, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England.",chin@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk,"Neumann, Heinz/F-7875-2014","Neumann, Heinz/0000-0001-9657-1913","ERC; MRC; Trinity College, Cambridge","We are grateful to P.

This occurs by the combined action of the gastric intrinsic factor (IF) and the ileal endocytic cubam receptor formed by the 460-kilodalton (kDa) protein cubilin and the 45-kDa transmembrane protein amnionless(1,2). Loss of function of any of these proteins ultimately leads to Cbl deficiency in man(3,4). Here we present the crystal structure of the complex between IF-Cbl and the cubilin IF-Cbl-binding-region (CUB5-8)(5) determined at 3.3 angstrom resolution. The structure provides insight into how several CUB (for 'complement C1r/C1s, Uegf, Bmp1') domains collectively function as modular ligand-binding regions, and how two distant CUB domains embrace the Cbl molecule by binding the two IF domains in a Ca2+-dependent manner. This dual-point model provides a probable explanation of how Cbl indirectly induces ligand-receptor coupling. Finally, the comparison of Ca2+-binding CUB domains and the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-type A modules suggests that the electrostatic pairing of a basic ligand arginine/lysine residue with Ca2+-coordinating acidic aspartates/glutamates is a common theme of Ca2+-dependent ligand-receptor interactions.","[Andersen, Christian Brix Folsted; Madsen, Mette; Storm, Tina; Moestrup, Soren K.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Med Biochem, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Andersen, Christian Brix Folsted; Andersen, Gregers R.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Mol Biol, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark","Moestrup, SK (reprint author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Med Biochem, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",skm@biokemi.au.dk,"Andersen, Christian/G-9954-2011; Moestrup, Soren Kragh/A-1403-2014","Moestrup, Soren Kragh/0000-0003-3862-2107; Storm, Tina/0000-0001-6550-4072; Andersen, Gregers Rom/0000-0001-6292-3319",Lundbeck foundation; Danish Science Research Council; Novo Nordisk Foundation,"We are grateful to G.

Furthermore, although clinically useful inhibitors of HIV integrase have been developed, their mechanism of action remains speculative. Here we present a crystal structure of full-length integrase from the prototype foamy virus in complex with its cognate DNA. The structure shows the organization of the retroviral intasome comprising an integrase tetramer tightly associated with a pair of viral DNA ends. All three canonical integrase structural domains are involved in extensive protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions. The binding of strand-transfer inhibitors displaces the reactive viral DNA end from the active site, disarming the viral nucleoprotein complex.

Although this model is thought to apply to all vertebrates, this has yet to be established. Here we have examined three lateral gynandromorph chickens (a rare, naturally occurring phenomenon in which one side of the animal appears male and the other female) to investigate the sex-determining mechanism in birds. These studies demonstrated that gynandromorph birds are genuine male: female chimaeras, and indicated that male and female avian somatic cells may have an inherent sex identity. To test this hypothesis, we transplanted presumptive mesoderm between embryos of reciprocal sexes to generate embryos containing male: female chimaeric gonads. In contrast to the outcome for mammalian mixed-sex chimaeras, in chicken mixed-sex chimaeras the donor cells were excluded from the functional structures of the host gonad. In an example where female tissue was transplanted into a male host, donor cells contributing to the developing testis retained a female identity and expressed a marker of female function.

We identified several novel components of endocytic trafficking, including genes implicated in human diseases. We found that signalling pathways such as Wnt, integrin/cell adhesion, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and Notch regulate the endocytic system, and identified new genes involved in cargo sorting to a subset of signalling endosomes.

Massively parallel cDNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has been revolutionizing global transcriptomic analysis. Here, using a novel differential approach (dRNA-seq) selective for the 5' end of primary transcripts, we present a genome-wide map of H. pylori transcriptional start sites and operons. We discovered hundreds of transcriptional start sites within operons, and opposite to annotated genes, indicating that complexity of gene expression from the small H. pylori genome is increased by uncoupling of polycistrons and by genome-wide antisense transcription. We also discovered an unexpected number of similar to 60 small RNAs including the e-subdivision counterpart of the regulatory 6S RNA and associated RNA products, and potential regulators of cis- and trans-encoded target messenger RNAs. Our approach establishes a paradigm for mapping and annotating the primary transcriptomes of many living species.","[Sharma, Cynthia M.; Sittka, Alexandra; Vogel, Joerg] Max Planck Inst Infect Biol, RNA Biol Grp, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Hoffmann, Steve; Findeiss, Sven; Stadler, Peter F.] Univ Leipzig, Dept Comp Sci, D-04107 Leipzig, Germany; [Hoffmann, Steve; Findeiss, Sven; Stadler, Peter F.] Univ Leipzig, Interdisciplinary Ctr Bioinformat, D-04107 Leipzig, Germany; [Darfeuille, Fabien; Reignier, Jeremy; Chabas, Sandrine] INSERM, U869, F-33076 Bordeaux, France; [Darfeuille, Fabien; Reignier, Jeremy; Chabas, Sandrine] Univ Bordeaux, F-33076 Bordeaux, France; [Reiche, Kristin; Hackermueller, Joerg; Stadler, Peter F.] Fraunhofer Inst Cell Therapy & Immunol, RNom Grp, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Reinhardt, Richard] Max Planck Inst Mol Genet, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Stadler, Peter F.] Max Planck Inst Math Sci, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Stadler, Peter F.] Univ Vienna, Inst Theoret Chem, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Stadler, Peter F.] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA; [Vogel, Joerg] Univ Wurzburg, Inst Mol Infect Biol, D-97080 Wurzburg, Germany","Vogel, J (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Infect Biol, RNA Biol Grp, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",joerg.vogel@uni-wuerzburg.de,"Vogel, Jorg/D-5574-2011; Sharma, Cynthia/D-2869-2013; Hoffmann, Steve/E-1438-2013; Darfeuille, Fabien/M-3883-2014; Stadler, Peter F./L-7857-2015; Hackermuller, Jorg/F-2494-2016","Vogel, Jorg/0000-0003-2220-1404; Sharma, Cynthia Mira/0000-0002-2321-9705; Darfeuille, Fabien/0000-0003-1167-6113; Stadler, Peter F./0000-0002-5016-5191; Hackermuller, Jorg/0000-0003-4920-7072; Reiche, Kristin/0000-0002-4452-4872","NGFN, BMBF, Germany; DFG [SPP1258]; Regulatory RNAs in Prokaryotes [VO8751/2, VO8751/4, STA850/7-1]; University of Leipzig; Freistaat Sachsen; German Research Foundation IZBI [BIZ6/1-4]; Volkswagen Stiftung [I/82 720]; French Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-07-JCJC-0104-01]; French Association de la Recherche contre le Cancer (ARC); La Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer (LNCC)","We thank F.

Such a test has recently been proposed(1), using a quantity, E(G), that combines measures of large-scale gravitational lensing, galaxy clustering and structure growth rate. The combination is insensitive to 'galaxy bias' (the difference between the clustering of visible galaxies and invisible dark matter) and is thus robust to the uncertainty in this parameter. Modified theories of gravity generally predict values of E(G) different from the general relativistic prediction because, in these theories, the 'gravitational slip' (the difference between the two potentials that describe perturbations in the gravitational metric) is non-zero, which leads to changes in the growth of structure(2) and the strength of the gravitational lensing effect(3). Here we report that E(G) = 0.39 +/- 0.06 on length scales of tens of megaparsecs, in agreement with the general relativistic prediction of E(G) approximate to 0.4. The measured value excludes a model(1) within the tensor-vector-scalar gravity theory(4,5), which modifies both Newtonian and Einstein gravity. However, the relatively large uncertainty still permits models within f(R) theory(6), which is an extension of general relativity. A fivefold decrease in uncertainty is needed to rule out these models.","[Reyes, Reinabelle; Mandelbaum, Rachel; Gunn, James E.] Princeton Univ Observ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Seljak, Uros; Baldauf, Tobias; Lombriser, Lucas; Smith, Robert E.] Univ Zurich, Inst Theoret Phys, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Seljak, Uros] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys & Astron, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Seljak, Uros] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Seljak, Uros] Ewha Womans Univ, Inst Early Universe, Seoul 120750, South Korea","Reyes, R (reprint author), Princeton Univ Observ, Peyton Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",rreyes@astro.princeton.edu,"Mandelbaum, Rachel/N-8955-2014","Mandelbaum, Rachel/0000-0003-2271-1527",NASA; Space Telescope Science Institute; Swiss National Foundation; German National Academic Foundation,"R.

Unfortunately, we still have a poor understanding of how the stellar gas mixes near the stellar core, preventing precise predictions of stellar evolution(1). The unknown nature of the mixing processes as well as the extent of the central mixed region is particularly problematic for massive stars(2). Oscillations in stars with masses a few times that of the Sun offer a unique opportunity to disentangle the nature of various mixing processes, through the distinct signature they leave on period spacings in the gravity mode spectrum(3). Here we report the detection of numerous gravity modes in a young star with a mass of about seven solar masses. The mean period spacing allows us to estimate the extent of the convective core, and the clear periodic deviation from the mean constrains the location of the chemical transition zone to be at about 10 per cent of the radius and rules out a clearcut profile.","[Degroote, Pieter; Aerts, Conny; Briquet, Maryline; Bloemen, Steven; Oreiro, Raquel; Vuckovic, Maja; Smolders, Kristof] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Inst Sterrenkunde, B-3001 Louvain, Belgium; [Aerts, Conny] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Astrophys, IMAPP, NL-6500 GL Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Baglin, Annie; Auvergne, Michel; Catala, Claude; Michel, Eric] Univ Paris 07, Univ Paris 06, Observ Paris, LESIA,UMR8109, F-92195 Meudon, France; [Miglio, Andrea; Noels, Arlette; Montalban, Josefina] Univ Liege, Inst Astrophys & Geophys, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; [Niemczura, Ewa] Univ Wroclaw, Astron Inst, PL-51622 Wroclaw, Poland; [Baudin, Frederic] Inst Astrophys Spatiale, F-91405 Orsay, France","Degroote, P (reprint author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Inst Sterrenkunde, Celestijnenlaan 200D, B-3001 Louvain, Belgium.",pieter.degroote@ster.kuleuven.ac.be,,"Oreiro Rey, Raquel/0000-0002-4899-6199",European Research Council under the European Community; Research Council of KU Leuven; Belgian Federal Science Policy,"The research leading to these results received funding from the European Research Council under the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (PROSPERITY), from the Research Council of KU Leuven and from the Belgian Federal Science Policy.

But in addition to charge, an electron also has spin(2), and the collective motion of spin can propagate-and so transfer a signal-in some insulators(3). This motion is called a spin wave and is usually excited using magnetic fields. Here we show that a spin wave in an insulator can be generated and detected using spin-Hall effects, which enable the direct conversion of an electric signal into a spin wave, and its subsequent transmission through (and recovery from) an insulator over macroscopic distances. First, we show evidence for the transfer of spin angular momentum between an insulator magnet Y(3)Fe(5)O(12) and a platinum film. This transfer allows direct conversion of an electric current in the platinum film to a spin wave in the Y(3)Fe(5)O(12) via spin-Hall effects(4-11). Second, making use of the transfer in a Pt/Y(3)Fe(5)O(12)/Pt system, we demonstrate that an electric current in one metal film induces voltage in the other, far distant, metal film. Specifically, the applied electric current is converted into spin angular momentum owing to the spin-Hall effect(7,8,10,11) in the first platinum film; the angular momentum is then carried by a spin wave in the insulating Y(3)Fe(5)O(12) layer; at the distant platinum film, the spin angular momentum of the spin wave is converted back to an electric voltage. This effect can be switched on and off using a magnetic field. Weak spin damping(3) in Y(3)Fe(5)O(12) is responsible for its transparency for the transmission of spin angular momentum. This hybrid electrical transmission method potentially offers a means of innovative signal delivery in electrical circuits and devices.","[Kajiwara, Y.; Harii, K.; Takahashi, S.; Ohe, J.; Uchida, K.; Mizuguchi, M.; Ando, K.; Takanashi, K.; Maekawa, S.; Saitoh, E.] Tohoku Univ, Inst Mat Res, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan; [Kajiwara, Y.; Ando, K.; Saitoh, E.] Keio Univ, Dept Appl Phys & Physicoinformat, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2238522, Japan; [Harii, K.; Takahashi, S.; Maekawa, S.] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, CREST, Tokyo 1020075, Japan; [Saitoh, E.] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, PRESTO, Tokyo 1020075, Japan; [Umezawa, H.; Kawai, H.] FDK Corp, Shizuoka 4310495, Japan","Saitoh, E (reprint author), Tohoku Univ, Inst Mat Res, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan.",saitoheiji@imr.tohoku.ac.jp,"Takahashi, Saburo/A-8472-2011; Ando, Kazuya/A-8521-2011; Takanashi, Koki/A-9488-2011; Uchida, Ken-ichi/H-3098-2011; Saitoh, Eiji/C-1004-2011; Mizuguchi, Masaki/K-3301-2013","Takanashi, Koki/0000-0003-4813-4641; ","MEXT, Japan [19048028, C12]; NEDO, Japan; TRF, Japan","We thank K.

Such properties have enabled a variety of applications including deployable space structures(6), biomedical devices(7,8), adaptive optical devices(9), smart dry adhesives(10) and fasteners(11). The ultimate potential for a shape memory polymer, however, is limited by the number of temporary shapes it can memorize in each shape memory cycle and the ability to tune the shape memory transition temperature(s) for the targeted applications. Currently known shape memory polymers are capable of memorizing one or two temporary shapes, corresponding to dual-and triple-shape memory effects (also counting the permanent shape), respectively(11-13). At the molecular level, the maximum number of temporary shapes a shape memory polymer can memorize correlates directly to the number of discrete reversible phase transitions (shape memory transitions) in the polymer(11-13). Intuitively, one might deduce that multi-shape memory effects are achievable simply by introducing additional reversible phase transitions. The task of synthesizing a polymer with more than two distinctive and strongly bonded(13) reversible phases, however, is extremely challenging. Tuning shape memory effects, on the other hand, is often achieved through tailoring the shape memory transition temperatures, which requires alteration in the material composition(14-16). Here I show that the perfluoro sulphonic acid ionomer (PFSA), which has only one broad reversible phase transition, exhibits dual-, triple-, and at least quadruple-shape memory effects, all highly tunable without any change to the material composition.","Gen Motors Res & Dev Ctr, Chem Sci & Mat Syst Lab, Warren, MI 48090 USA","Xie, T (reprint author), Gen Motors Res & Dev Ctr, Chem Sci & Mat Syst Lab, Mail Code 480-106-710,30500 Mound Rd, Warren, MI 48090 USA.",tao.xie@gm.com,"Xie, Tao/B-2323-2009; Xie, Tao/H-8633-2013",,,,,28,491,499,61,499,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-Mar,2010,464,7286,,,,,267,270,,10.1038/nature08863,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,566JO,WOS:000275366100044,20220846.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,tao,xie,male,0.7,27,na,na

Chlorine atoms can decrease the lifetimes of gaseous elemental mercury(1) and hydrocarbons such as the greenhouse gas methane(2). Chlorine atoms also influence cycles that catalytically destroy or produce tropospheric ozone(3), a greenhouse gas potentially toxic to plant and animal life. Conversion of inorganic chloride into gaseous chlorine atom precursors within the troposphere is generally considered a coastal or marine air phenomenon(4). Here we report mid-continental observations of the chlorine atom precursor nitryl chloride at a distance of 1,400km from the nearest coastline. We observe persistent and significant nitryl chloride production relative to the consumption of its nitrogen oxide precursors. Comparison of these findings to model predictions based on aerosol and precipitation composition data from long-term monitoring networks suggests nitryl chloride production in the contiguous USA alone is at a level similar to previous global estimates for coastal and marine regions(5).

Although the divergence observed at some host-resistance(4-6) and parasite-infectivity(7-9) genes is consistent with this, the long time periods typically required to study coevolution have so far prevented any direct empirical test. Here we show, using experimental populations of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 and its viral parasite, phage Phi 2 (refs 10, 11), that the rate of molecular evolution in the phage was far higher when both bacterium and phage coevolved with each other than when phage evolved against a constant host genotype. Coevolution also resulted in far greater genetic divergence between replicate populations, which was correlated with the range of hosts that coevolved phage were able to infect. Consistent with this, the most rapidly evolving phage genes under coevolution were those involved in host infection. These results demonstrate, at both the genomic and phenotypic level, that antagonistic coevolution is a cause of rapid and divergent evolution, and is likely to be a major driver of evolutionary change within species.","[Paterson, Steve; Vogwill, Tom; Libberton, Ben; Fenton, Andrew; Hall, Neil; Brockhurst, Michael A.] Univ Liverpool, Sch Biol Sci, Liverpool L69 7ZB, Merseyside, England; [Buckling, Angus; Benmayor, Rebecca] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Spiers, Andrew J.] Univ Abertay Dundee, SIMBIOS Ctr, Dundee DD1 1HG, Scotland; [Thomson, Nicholas R.; Quail, Mike; Smith, Frances; Walker, Danielle] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Cambridge CB10 1SA, England","Brockhurst, MA (reprint author), Univ Liverpool, Sch Biol Sci, Biosci Bldg,Crown St, Liverpool L69 7ZB, Merseyside, England.",michael.brockhurst@liverpool.ac.uk,"Paterson, Steve/D-2154-2009; Brockhurst, Michael/A-6247-2009; Spiers, Andrew/I-3535-2012","Paterson, Steve/0000-0002-1307-2981; Spiers, Andrew/0000-0003-0463-8629; Brockhurst, Michael/0000-0003-0362-820X; Vogwill, Tom/0000-0003-1044-6623; Libberton, Ben/0000-0001-9104-679X; Hall, Neil/0000-0003-2808-0009; Thomson, Nicholas/0000-0002-4432-8505",Natural Environment Research Council; Wellcome Trust; Leverhulme Trust; European Research Council,"We are grateful to M.

Here we study the fitness landscapes traversed by switches between different AU and GC Watson-Crick nucleotide pairs at complementary sites of mitochondrial transfer RNA stem regions in 83 mammalian species. We find that such Watson-Crick switches occur 30-40 times more slowly than pairs of neutral substitutions, and that alleles corresponding to GU and AC non-Watson-Crick intermediate states segregate within human populations at low frequencies, similar to those of non-synonymous alleles. Substitutions leading to a Watson Crick switch are strongly correlated, especially in mitochondrial tRNAs encoded on the GT-nucleotide-rich strand of the mitochondrial genome. Using these data we estimate that a typical Watson-Crick switch involves crossing a fitness valley of a depth of about 10(-3) or even about 10(-2), with AC intermediates being slightly more deleterious than GU intermediates. This compensatory evolution must proceed through rare intermediate variants that never reach fixation(2). The ubiquitous nature of compensatory evolution in mammalian mitochondrial tRNAs and other molecules(10,11) implies that simultaneous fixation of two alleles that are individually deleterious may be a common phenomenon at the molecular level.","[Meer, Margarita V.; Kondrashov, Fyodor A.] Ctr Genom Regulat, Bioinformat & Genom Programme, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Kondrashov, Alexey S.; Artzy-Randrup, Yael] Univ Michigan, Inst Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Artzy-Randrup, Yael] Univ Michigan, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Ann Arbor, MI 49109 USA; [Artzy-Randrup, Yael] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 49109 USA","Kondrashov, FA (reprint author), Ctr Genom Regulat, Bioinformat & Genom Programme, C Dr Aiguader 88,Barcelona Biomed Res Pk Bldg, Barcelona 08003, Spain.",fyodor.kondrashov@crg.es,"Kondrashov, Fyodor Alexeevich/H-6331-2015","Kondrashov, Fyodor Alexeevich/0000-0001-8243-4694",,,,48,49,49,1,17,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-Mar,2010,464,7286,,,,,279,U159,,10.1038/nature08691,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,566JO,WOS:000275366100047,20182427.0,No,,,11/20/17,fyodor a.,kondrashov,na,na,na,na,na

Allozyme analysis revealed a high degree of fixed heterozygosity in these parthenogenetic species(1,2), supporting the view that they originated from hybridization events between related sexual species. It has remained unclear how the meiotic program is altered to produce diploid eggs while maintaining heterozygosity. Here we show that meiosis commences with twice the number of chromosomes in parthenogenetic versus sexual species, a mechanism that provides the basis for generating gametes with unreduced chromosome content without fundamental deviation from the classic meiotic program. Our observation of synaptonemal complexes and chiasmata demonstrate that a typical meiotic program occurs and that heterozygosity is not maintained by bypassing recombination. Instead, fluorescent in situ hybridization probes that distinguish between homologues reveal that bivalents form between sister chromosomes, the genetically identical products of the first of two premeiotic replication cycles. Sister chromosome pairing provides a mechanism for the maintenance of heterozygosity, which is critical for offsetting the reduced fitness associated with the lack of genetic diversity in parthenogenetic species.","[Lutes, Aracely A.; Neaves, William B.; Baumann, Diana P.; Wiegraebe, Winfried; Baumann, Peter] Stowers Inst Med Res, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; [Lutes, Aracely A.; Baumann, Peter] Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Dept Mol & Integrat Physiol, Kansas City, KS 66160 USA; [Neaves, William B.] Univ Missouri, Sch Med, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; [Baumann, Peter] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA","Baumann, P (reprint author), Stowers Inst Med Res, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA.",peb@stowers.org,,"Baumann, Peter/0000-0003-4892-1485",Stowers Institute for Medical Research; Pew Charitable Trusts,"We thank the staff of the Reptile Facility for their dedication to animal husbandry; C.

For multicellular organisms, however, the pleiotropy of gene function has largely restricted such approaches to the study of early embryogenesis. With the availability of genome-wide transgenic RNA interference (RNAi) libraries in Drosophila(1,2), it is now possible to perform a systematic genetic dissection of any cell or tissue type at any stage of the lifespan. Here we apply these methods to define the genetic basis for formation and function of the Drosophila muscle. We identify a role inmuscle for 2,785 genes, many of which we assign to specific functions in the organization of muscles, myofibrils or sarcomeres.

Patient-specific induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells(4) represent invaluable in vitro models for human degenerative disorders like DC. A cardinal feature of iPS cells is acquisition of indefinite self-renewal capacity, which is accompanied by induction of the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (TERT)(5-7). We investigated whether defects in telomerase function would limit derivation and maintenance of iPS cells from patients with DC. Here we show that reprogrammed DC cells overcome a critical limitation in telomerase RNA component (TERC) levels to restore telomere maintenance and self-renewal. We discovered that TERC upregulation is a feature of the pluripotent state, that several telomerase components are targeted by pluripotency-associated transcription factors, and that in autosomal dominant DC, transcriptional silencing accompanies a 3' deletion at the TERC locus. Our results demonstrate that reprogramming restores telomere elongation in DC cells despite genetic lesions affecting telomerase, and show that strategies to increase TERC expression may be therapeutically beneficial in DC patients.","[Agarwal, Suneet; Loh, Yuin-Han; McLoughlin, Erin M.; Park, In-Hyun; Miller, Justine D.; Huo, Hongguang; Loewer, Sabine; Daley, George Q.] Childrens Hosp, Div Hematol Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Agarwal, Suneet; Loh, Yuin-Han; McLoughlin, Erin M.; Park, In-Hyun; Miller, Justine D.; Huo, Hongguang; Loewer, Sabine; Daley, George Q.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Agarwal, Suneet; Loh, Yuin-Han; McLoughlin, Erin M.; Park, In-Hyun; Miller, Justine D.; Huo, Hongguang; Loewer, Sabine; Daley, George Q.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem & Mol Pharmacol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Agarwal, Suneet; Loh, Yuin-Han; McLoughlin, Erin M.; Park, In-Hyun; Miller, Justine D.; Huo, Hongguang; Loewer, Sabine; Daley, George Q.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Hematol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Agarwal, Suneet; Loh, Yuin-Han; McLoughlin, Erin M.; Park, In-Hyun; Miller, Justine D.; Huo, Hongguang; Loewer, Sabine; Daley, George Q.] Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Agarwal, Suneet; Loh, Yuin-Han; McLoughlin, Erin M.; Park, In-Hyun; Miller, Justine D.; Huo, Hongguang; Loewer, Sabine; Daley, George Q.] Manton Ctr Orphan Dis Res, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Huang, Junjiu; Okuka, Maja; dos Reis, Rosana Maria; Keefe, David L.; Liu, Lin] Univ S Florida, Coll Med, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, MDC 3125, Tampa, FL 33612 USA; [Huang, Junjiu] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Biocontrol, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Ng, Huck-Hui] Genome Inst Singapore, Gene Regulatory Lab, Singapore 138672, Singapore; [Ng, Huck-Hui] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Biol Sci, Singapore 138672, Singapore; [Goldman, Frederick D.] Childrens Hosp Alabama, Dept Pediat, Birmingham, AL 35233 USA; [Klingelhutz, Aloysius J.] Univ Iowa, Dept Microbiol, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Liu, Lin] Nankai Univ, Coll Life Sci, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China; [Daley, George Q.] Childrens Hosp, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Daley, GQ (reprint author), Childrens Hosp, Div Hematol Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",george.daley@childrens.harvard.edu,"Ng, Huck Hui/A-1135-2009; Saude da mulher, Inct/J-9403-2013; Loh, Yuin-Han/E-1096-2014; Reis, Rosana/E-3346-2012","Loh, Yuin-Han/0000-0002-4715-6454; Reis, Rosana/0000-0001-9631-4167; NG, HUCK HUI/0000-0001-6352-8417","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [K08HL089150, R01AG0227388]; Manton Center for Orphan Disease Research; Amy Clare Potter Fellowship; Agency of Science, Technology and Research; Institute of Medical Biology, Singapore; James and Esther King Biomedical Research Program; MOST 973 project [2009CB941000]","This work was funded by grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Manton Center for Orphan Disease Research (G.

In general, concentrated saline solutions elicit robust behavioural aversion, whereas low concentrations of NaCl are typically attractive, particularly after sodium depletion(1-5). Notably, the attractive salt pathway is selectively responsive to sodium and inhibited by amiloride, whereas the aversive one functions as a nonselective detector for a wide range of salts(1-3,6-9). Because amiloride is a potent inhibitor of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), ENaC has been proposed to function as a component of the salt-taste-receptor system(1,3,6-14). Previously, we showed that four of the five basic taste qualities-sweet, sour, bitter and umami-are mediated by separate taste-receptor cells (TRCs) each tuned to a single taste modality, and wired to elicit stereotypical behavioural responses(5,15-18). Here we show that sodium sensing is also mediated by a dedicated population of TRCs. These taste cells express the epithelial sodium channel ENaC(19,20), and mediate behavioural attraction to NaCl. We genetically engineered mice lacking ENaC alpha in TRCs, and produced animals exhibiting a complete loss of salt attraction and sodium taste responses. Together, these studies substantiate independent cellular substrates for all five basic taste qualities, and validate the essential role of ENaC for sodium taste in mice.","[Chandrashekar, Jayaram; Oka, Yuki; Yarmolinsky, David A.; Zuker, Charles S.] Univ Calif San Diego, Howard Hughes Med Inst, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Chandrashekar, Jayaram; Oka, Yuki; Yarmolinsky, David A.; Zuker, Charles S.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Neurobiol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Chandrashekar, Jayaram; Oka, Yuki; Yarmolinsky, David A.; Zuker, Charles S.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Neurosci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Kuhn, Christina; Ryba, Nicholas J.

Although radical prostatectomy, radiation and androgen ablation are effective therapies for androgen-dependent CaP, metastatic castration-resistant CaP is a major complication with high mortality(2). Androgens stimulate growth and survival of prostate epithelium and early CaP. Although most patients initially respond to androgen ablation, many develop castration-resistant CaP within 12-18 months(2). Despite extensive studies, the mechanisms underlying the emergence of castration-resistant CaP remain poorly understood and their elucidation is critical for developing improved therapies. Curiously, castration-resistant CaP remains androgen-receptor dependent, and potent androgen-receptor antagonists induce tumour regression in castrated mice(3). The role of inflammation in castration-resistant CaP has not been addressed, although it was reported that intrinsic NF-kappa B activation supports its growth(4). Inflammation is a localized protective reaction to injury or infection, but it also has a pathogenic role in many diseases, including cancer(5). Whereas acute inflammation is critical for host defence, chronic inflammation contributes to tumorigenesis and metastatic progression. The inflammation-responsive I kappa B kinase (IKK)-beta and its target NF-kB have important tumour-promoting functions within malignant cells and inflammatory cells(6). The latter, including macrophages and lymphocytes, are important elements of the tumour microenvironment(7-9), but the mechanisms underlying their recruitment remain obscure, although they are thought to depend on chemokine and cytokine production(10). We found that CaP progression is associated with inflammatory infiltration and activation of IKK-alpha, which stimulates metastasis by an NF-kappa B-independent, cell autonomous mechanism(11). Here we show that androgen ablation causes infiltration of regressing androgen-dependent tumours with leukocytes, including B cells, in which IKK-beta activation results in production of cytokines that activate IKK-alpha and STAT3 in CaP cells to enhance hormone-free survival.","[Ammirante, Massimo; Grivennikov, Sergei; Karin, Michael] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Lab Gene Regulat & Signal Transduct, Dept Pharmacol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Ammirante, Massimo; Grivennikov, Sergei; Karin, Michael] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Ctr Canc, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Luo, Jun-Li] Scripps Res Inst Florida, Dept Canc Biol, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA; [Nedospasov, Sergei] VA Engelhardt Mol Biol Inst, Lab Mol Immunol, Moscow 119991, Russia","Karin, M (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Lab Gene Regulat & Signal Transduct, Dept Pharmacol, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",karinoffice@ucsd.edu,"Nedospasov, Sergei/J-5936-2013; Nedospasov, Sergei/L-1990-2015; Nedospasov, Sergei/Q-7319-2016",,Fondazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro; American-Italian Cancer Foundation; Life Science Research Fellowship; National Institutes of Health; US Army Medical Research and Material Command and Prostate Cancer Foundation; Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro,"We thank C.

The Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is believed to regulate transcriptional repression by catalysing the di- and tri-methylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me2/3)(2). At present, it is unknown how the PcG proteins are recruited to their target promoters in mammalian cells(3). Here we show that PRC2 forms a stable complex with the Jumonji- and ARID-domain-containing protein, JARID2 (ref. 4). Using genome-wide location analysis, we show that JARID2 binds to more than 90% of previously mapped PcG target genes. Notably, we show that JARID2 is sufficient to recruit PcG proteins to a heterologous promoter, and that inhibition of JARID2 expression leads to a major loss of PcG binding and to a reduction of H3K27me3 levels on target genes. Consistent with an essential role for PcG proteins in early development(5-8), we demonstrate that JARID2 is required for the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells. Thus, these results demonstrate that JARID2 is essential for the binding of PcG proteins to target genes and, consistent with this, for the proper differentiation of embryonic stem cells and normal development.","[Pasini, Diego; Cloos, Paul A.

Single-locus models of selection cannot explain the maintenance of such complex variation because recombination separates co-adapted alleles. Here we report a previously unrecognized type of intraspecific multi-locus genetic variation that has been maintained over a vast period. The galactose (GAL) utilization gene network of Saccharomyces kudriavzevii, a relative of brewer's yeast, exists in two distinct states: a functional gene network in Portuguese strains and, in Japanese strains, a non-functional gene network of allelic pseudogenes. Genome sequencing of all available S. kudriavzevii strains revealed that none of the functional GAL genes were acquired from other species. Rather, these polymorphisms have been maintained for nearly the entire history of the species, despite more recent gene flow genome-wide. Experimental evidence suggests that inactivation of the GAL3 and GAL80 regulatory genes facilitated the origin and long-term maintenance of the two gene network states. This striking example of a balanced unlinked gene network polymorphism introduces a remarkable type of intraspecific variation that may be widespread.","[Hittinger, Chris Todd; Dover, Jim; Johnston, Mark] Univ Colorado, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Genet, Aurora, CO 80045 USA; [Hittinger, Chris Todd; Dover, Jim; Johnston, Mark] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Ctr Genome Sci, St Louis, MO 63108 USA; [Goncalves, Paula; Sampaio, Jose Paulo] Univ Nova Lisboa, Ctr Recursos Microbiol, Dept Ciencias Vida, Fac Ciencias & Tecnol, P-2829516 Caparica, Portugal; [Rokas, Antonis] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Nashville, TN 37235 USA","Johnston, M (reprint author), Univ Colorado, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Genet, Aurora, CO 80045 USA.",mark.johnston@ucdenver.edu,"Sampaio, Jose Paulo/C-5532-2011; Goncalves, Paula/B-4016-2010; REQUIMTE, MM/M-6160-2013; REQUIMTE, UCIBIO/N-9846-2013; Rokas, Antonis/A-9775-2008","Sampaio, Jose Paulo/0000-0001-8145-5274; Goncalves, Paula/0000-0003-2103-1060; Rokas, Antonis/0000-0002-7248-6551; Johnston, Mark/0000-0002-4932-7229","James S.

It locates its human hosts primarily through olfaction, but little is known about the molecular basis of this process. Here we functionally characterize the Anopheles gambiae odorant receptor (AgOr) repertoire. We identify receptors that respond strongly to components of human odour and that may act in the process of human recognition. Some of these receptors are narrowly tuned, and some salient odorants elicit strong responses from only one or a few receptors, suggesting a central role for specific transmission channels in human host-seeking behaviour. This analysis of the Anopheles gambiae receptors permits a comparison with the corresponding Drosophila melanogaster odorant receptor repertoire. We find that odorants are differentially encoded by the two species in ways consistent with their ecological needs. Our analysis of the Anopheles gambiae repertoire identifies receptors that may be useful targets for controlling the transmission of malaria.","[Carey, Allison F.; Su, Chih-Ying; Carlson, John R.] Yale Univ, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Wang, Guirong; Zwiebel, Laurence J.] Vanderbilt Univ, Global Hlth & Program Dev Biol, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Wang, Guirong; Zwiebel, Laurence J.] Vanderbilt Univ, Inst Biol Chem, Ctr Mol Neurosci, Dept Biol Sci, Nashville, TN 37235 USA","Carlson, JR (reprint author), Yale Univ, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",john.carlson@yale.edu,,"Zwiebel, Laurence/0000-0001-6686-7289",Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (NIH); NIH [2T32GM07205],"We thank W. van der Goes van Naters and C.

On the basis of the apparent absence of the most metal-poor stars in present-day dwarf galaxies, recent studies(3) claimed that the true Galactic building blocks must have been vastly different from the surviving dwarfs. The discovery of an extremely iron-poor star (S1020549) in the Sculptor dwarf galaxy based on a medium-resolution spectrum(4) cast some doubt on this conclusion. Verification of the iron-deficiency, however, and measurements of additional elements, such as the a-element Mg, are necessary to demonstrate that the same type of stars produced the metals found in dwarf galaxies and the Galactic halo. Only then can dwarf galaxy stars be conclusively linked to early stellar halo assembly. Here we report high-resolution spectroscopic abundances for 11 elements in S1020549, confirming its iron abundance of less than 1/4,000th that of the Sun, and showing that the overall abundance pattern follows that seen in low-metallicity halo stars, including the a-elements. Such chemical similarity indicates that the systems destroyed to form the halo billions of years ago were not fundamentally different from the progenitors of present-day dwarfs, and suggests that the early chemical enrichment of all galaxies may be nearly identical.","[Frebel, Anna] Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kirby, Evan N.] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Simon, Joshua D.] Observ Carnegie Inst Washington, Pasadena, CA 91101 USA","Frebel, A (reprint author), Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, 60 Garden St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",afrebel@cfa.harvard.edu,,"Kirby, Evan/0000-0001-6196-5162",NASA; Space Telescope Science Institute; Carnegie Institution of Washington,"Our data was gathered using the 6.5-m Magellan telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.

In the case of organic superconductors, however, no new material system with a high superconducting transition temperature (T(c)) has been discovered in the past decade. Here we report that intercalating an alkali metal into picene, a wide-bandgap semiconducting solid hydrocarbon, produces metallic behaviour and superconductivity. Solid potassium-intercalated picene (K(x)picene) shows T(c) values of 7K and 18 K, depending on the metal content. The drop of magnetization in Kxpicene solids at the transition temperature is sharp (<2 K), similar to the behaviour of Ca-intercalated graphite(1). The Tc of 18K is comparable to that of K-intercalated C(60) (ref. 4).

A germanium photodetector that can be monolithically integrated with silicon transistor technology(2-8) is viewed as a key element in connecting chip components with infrared optical signals. Such a device should have the capability to detect very-low-power optical signals at very high speed. Although germanium avalanche photodetectors(9,10) (APD) using charge amplification close to avalanche breakdown can achieve high gain and thus detect low-power optical signals, they are universally considered to suffer from an intolerably high amplification noise characteristic of germanium(11). High gain with low excess noise has been demonstrated using a germanium layer only for detection of light signals, with amplification taking place in a separate silicon layer(12). However, the relatively thick semiconductor layers that are required in such structures limit APD speeds to about 10GHz, and require excessively high bias voltages of around 25V (ref. 12). Here we show how nanophotonic and nanoelectronic engineering aimed at shaping optical and electrical fields on the nanometre scale within a germanium amplification layer can overcome the otherwise intrinsically poor noise characteristics, achieving a dramatic reduction of amplification noise by over 70 per cent. By generating strongly non-uniform electric fields, the region of impact ionization in germanium is reduced to just 30nm, allowing the device to benefit from the noise reduction effects(13-15) that arise at these small distances. Furthermore, the smallness of the APDs means that a bias voltage of only 1.5V is required to achieve an avalanche gain of over 10dB with operational speeds exceeding 30GHz. Monolithic integration of such a device into computer chips might enable applications beyond computer optical interconnects(1)-in telecommunications(16), secure quantum key distribution(17), and subthreshold ultralow-power transistors(18).","[Assefa, Solomon; Xia, Fengnian; Vlasov, Yurii A.] IBM Corp, Thomas J Watson Res Ctr, Yorktown Hts, NY 10598 USA","Assefa, S (reprint author), IBM Corp, Thomas J Watson Res Ctr, Yorktown Hts, NY 10598 USA.",sassefa@us.ibm.com,"Xia, Fengnian/D-1003-2012; Vlasov, Yurii/E-8209-2011; Xia, Fengnian/O-2637-2015","Vlasov, Yurii/0000-0002-5864-3346; Xia, Fengnian/0000-0001-5176-368X",,,,30,270,274,10,158,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,4-Mar,2010,464,7285,,,,,80,U91,,10.1038/nature08813,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,563GZ,WOS:000275117500037,20203606.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,yurii a.,vlasov,na,na,na,na,na

However, it becomes universally unstable with the superposition of a shear stress parallel to the crack front (mode III). Under this mixed-mode (I + III) loading configuration, an initially flat parent crack segments into an array of daughter cracks that rotate towards a direction of maximum tensile stress(1). This segmentation produces stepped fracture surfaces with characteristic 'lance-shaped' markings observed in a wide range of engineering(2-7) and geological materials(1,8). The origin of this instability remains poorly understood and a theory with which to predict the surface roughness scale is lacking. Here we perform large-scale simulations of mixed-mode I + III brittle fracture using a continuum phase-field method(9-11) that describes the complete three-dimensional crack-front evolution. The simulations reveal that planar crack propagation is linearly unstable against helical deformations of the crack front, which evolve nonlinearly into a segmented array of finger-shaped daughter cracks. Furthermore, during their evolution, facets gradually coarsen owing to the growth competition of daughter cracks in striking analogy with the coarsening of finger patterns observed in nonequilibrium growth phenomena(12-14). We show that the dynamically preferred unstable wavelength is governed by the balance of the destabilizing effect of far-field stresses and the stabilizing effect of cohesive forces on the process zone scale, and we derive a theoretical estimate for this scale using a new propagation law for curved cracks in three dimensions. The rotation angles of coarsened facets are also compared to theoretical predictions and available experimental data.","[Pons, Antonio J.; Karma, Alain] Northeastern Univ, Dept Phys, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Pons, Antonio J.; Karma, Alain] Northeastern Univ, Ctr Interdisciplinary Res Complex Syst, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Karma, A (reprint author), Northeastern Univ, Dept Phys, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",a.karma@neu.edu,"Pons, Antonio/E-7467-2011","Pons, Antonio/0000-0002-1481-8159",US DOE [DE-FG02-07ER46400]; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation;  [EX2005-0085];  [FIS2009-13360-C03-02],"We thank V.

A globally distributed(2,3), periodically abundant(4) N(2)-fixing(5) marine cyanobacterium, UCYN-A, was recently found to lack the oxygen-producing photosystem II complex(6) of the photosynthetic apparatus, indicating a novel metabolism, but remains uncultivated. Here we show, from metabolic reconstructions inferred from the assembly of the complete UCYN-A genome using massively parallel pyro-sequencing of paired-end reads, that UCYN-A has a photofermentative metabolism and is dependent on other organisms for essential compounds. We found that UCYN-A lacks a number of major metabolic pathways including the tricarboxylic acid cycle, but retains sufficient electron transport capacity to generate energy and reducing power from light. Unexpectedly, UCYN-A has a reduced genome (1.44 megabases) that is structurally similar to many chloroplasts and some bacteria, in that it contains inverted repeats of ribosomal RNA operons(7). The lack of biosynthetic pathways for several amino acids and purines suggests that this organism depends on other organisms, either in close association or in symbiosis, for critical nutrients. However, size fractionation experiments using natural populations have so far not provided evidence of a symbiotic association with another microorganism. The UCYN-A cyanobacterium is a paradox in evolution and adaptation to the marine environment, and is an example of the tight metabolic coupling between microorganisms in oligotrophic oceanic microbial communities.","[Tripp, H.

Recently, a variety of Silesaurus-like taxa have been reported from the Triassic period of both Gondwana and Laurasia, but their relationships to each other and to dinosaurs remain a subject of debate(3-5). Here we report on a new avian-line archosaur from the early Middle Triassic (Anisian) of Tanzania. Phylogenetic analysis places Asilisaurus kongwe gen. et sp. nov. as an avian-line archosaur and a member of the Silesauridae, which is here considered the sister taxon to Dinosauria. Silesaurids were diverse and had a wide distribution by the Late Triassic, with a novel ornithodiran bauplan including leaf-shaped teeth, a beak-like lower jaw, long, gracile limbs, and a quadrupedal stance. Our analysis suggests that the dentition and diet of silesaurids, ornithischians and sauropodomorphs evolved independently from a plesiomorphic carnivorous form. As the oldest avian-line archosaur, Asilisaurus demonstrates the antiquity of both Ornithodira and the dinosaurian lineage. The initial diversification of Archosauria, previously documented by crocodilian-line archosaurs in the Anisian(6), can now be shown to include a contemporaneous avian-line radiation. The unparalleled taxonomic diversity of the Manda archosaur assemblage indicates that archosaur diversification was well underway by the Middle Triassic or earlier.","[Nesbitt, Sterling J.] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Nesbitt, Sterling J.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Paleontol, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Sidor, Christian A.] Univ Washington, Burke Museum, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Sidor, Christian A.] Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Irmis, Randall B.] Utah Museum Nat Hist, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Irmis, Randall B.] Univ Utah, Dept Geol & Geophys, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Angielczyk, Kenneth D.] Field Museum, Dept Geol, Chicago, IL 60605 USA; [Smith, Roger M.

Microbial pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) activate innate immunocytes through pattern recognition receptors(2). Similarly, cellular injury can release endogenous 'damage'-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that activate innate immunity(3). Mitochondria are evolutionary endosymbionts that were derived from bacteria(4) and so might bear bacterial molecular motifs. Here we show that injury releases mitochondrial DAMPs (MTDs) into the circulation with functionally important immune consequences. MTDs include formyl peptides and mitochondrial DNA. These activate human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) through formyl peptide receptor-1 and Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9, respectively. MTDs promote PMN Ca(2+) flux and phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, thus leading to PMN migration and degranulation in vitro and in vivo. Circulating MTDs can elicit neutrophil-mediated organ injury. Cellular disruption by trauma releases mitochondrial DAMPs with evolutionarily conserved similarities to bacterial PAMPs into the circulation. These signal through innate immune pathways identical to those activated in sepsis to create a sepsis-like state. The release of such mitochondrial 'enemies within' by cellular injury is a key link between trauma, inflammation and SIRS.","[Zhang, Qin; Raoof, Mustafa; Chen, Yu; Sumi, Yuka; Sursal, Tolga; Junger, Wolfgang; Itagaki, Kiyoshi; Hauser, Carl J.] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Dept Surg, Div Trauma, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Zhang, Qin; Raoof, Mustafa; Chen, Yu; Sumi, Yuka; Sursal, Tolga; Junger, Wolfgang; Itagaki, Kiyoshi; Hauser, Carl J.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Brohi, Karim] Univ London, Barts & London Sch Med & Dent, Trauma Clin Acad Unit, London E1 1BB, England","Hauser, CJ (reprint author), Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Dept Surg, Div Trauma, 330 Brookline Ave, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",cjhauser@bidmc.harvard.edu,"Raoof, Mustafa/D-1664-2012","Itagaki, Kiyoshi/0000-0002-6033-1122",National Institute of General Medical Sciences; Department of Defense,This work is supported by a National Institute of General Medical Sciences grant and a Department of Defense CDMRP/DRMRP hypothesis development award (to C.J.H.).,,32,1147,1190,11,147,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-Mar,2010,464,7285,,,,,104,U115,,10.1038/nature08780,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,563GZ,WOS:000275117500042,20203610.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,carl j.,hauser,na,na,na,na,na

Generation of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from iPSCs or embryonic stem cells (ESCs) is not currently possible, however, necessitating a better understanding of how HSCs normally arise during embryonic development. We previously showed that haematopoiesis occurs through four distinct waves during zebrafish development, with HSCs arising in the final wave in close association with the dorsal aorta. Recent reports have suggested that murine HSCs derive from haemogenic endothelial cells (ECs) lining the aortic floor(1,2). Additional in vitro studies have similarly indicated that the haematopoietic progeny of ESCs arise through intermediates with endothelial potential(3,4). Here we have used the unique strengths of the zebrafish embryo to image directly the generation of HSCs from the ventral wall of the dorsal aorta. Using combinations of fluorescent reporter transgenes, confocal time-lapse microscopy and flow cytometry, we have identified and isolated the stepwise intermediates as aortic haemogenic endothelium transitions to nascent HSCs.

The first anatomical site from which cells with long-term HSC potential have been isolated is the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM), more specifically the vicinity of the dorsal aortic floor(3). But although some authors have presented evidence that HSCs may arise directly from the aortic floor into the dorsal aortic lumen(4), others support the notion that HSCs first emerge within the underlying mesenchyme(5). Here we show by non-invasive, high-resolution imaging of live zebrafish embryos, that HSCs emerge directly from the aortic floor, through a stereotyped process that does not involve cell division but a strong bending then egress of single endothelial cells from the aortic ventral wall into the sub-aortic space, and their concomitant transformation into haematopoietic cells. The process is polarized not only in the dorso-ventral but also in the rostro-caudal versus medio-lateral direction, and depends on Runx1 expression: in Runx1-deficient embryos, the exit events are initially similar, but much rarer, and abort into violent death of the exiting cell. These results demonstrate that the aortic floor is haemogenic and that HSCs emerge from it into the sub-aortic space, not by asymmetric cell division but through a new type of cell behaviour, which we call an endothelial haematopoietic transition.","[Kissa, Karima; Herbomel, Philippe] Inst Pasteur, Unite Macrophages & Dev Immun, F-75724 Paris 15, France; [Kissa, Karima; Herbomel, Philippe] CNRS, URA2578, F-75724 Paris, France","Herbomel, P (reprint author), Inst Pasteur, Unite Macrophages & Dev Immun, 25 Rue Dr Roux, F-75724 Paris 15, France.",philippe.herbomel@pasteur.fr,,,,,,21,392,398,1,37,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-Mar,2010,464,7285,,,,,112,U125,,10.1038/nature08761,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,563GZ,WOS:000275117500044,20154732.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,philippe,herbomel,male,0.99,605,na,na

Immunohistological analysis of fixed embryo sections has revealed the presence of haematopoietic cell clusters attached to the aortic endothelium where HSCs might localize(4-6). The origin of HSCs has long been controversial and several candidates of the direct HSC precursors have been proposed (for review see ref. 7), including a specialized endothelial cell population with a haemogenic potential. Such cells have been described both in vitro in the embryonic stem cell (ESC) culture system(8,9) and retrospectively in vivo by endothelial lineage tracing(5,10) and conditional deletion experiments(11). Whether the transition from haemogenic endothelium to HSC actually occurs in the mouse embryonic aorta is still unclear and requires direct and real-time in vivo observation. To address this issue we used time-lapse confocal imaging and a new dissection procedure to visualize the deeply located aorta.

They mediate adaptive responses to a variety of stresses, including calorie restriction and metabolic stress. Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) is localized in the mitochondrial matrix, where it regulates the acetylation levels of metabolic enzymes, including acetyl coenzyme A synthetase 2 (refs 1, 2). Mice lacking both Sirt3 alleles appear phenotypically normal under basal conditions, but show marked hyperacetylation of several mitochondrial proteins(3). Here we report that SIRT3 expression is upregulated during fasting in liver and brown adipose tissues. During fasting, livers from mice lacking SIRT3 had higher levels of fatty-acid oxidation intermediate products and triglycerides, associated with decreased levels of fatty-acid oxidation, compared to livers from wild-type mice. Mass spectrometry of mitochondrial proteins shows that long-chain acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase (LCAD) is hyperacetylated at lysine 42 in the absence of SIRT3. LCAD is deacetylated in wild-type mice under fasted conditions and by SIRT3 in vitro and in vivo; and hyperacetylation of LCAD reduces its enzymatic activity. Mice lacking SIRT3 exhibit hallmarks of fatty-acid oxidation disorders during fasting, including reduced ATP levels and intolerance to cold exposure. These findings identify acetylation as a novel regulatory mechanism for mitochondrial fatty-acid oxidation and demonstrate that SIRT3 modulates mitochondrial intermediary metabolism and fatty-acid use during fasting.","[Hirschey, Matthew D.; Shimazu, Tadahiro; Schwer, Bjoern; Verdin, Eric] Gladstone Inst Virol & Immunol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Hirschey, Matthew D.; Shimazu, Tadahiro; Schwer, Bjoern; Verdin, Eric] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Med, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Goetzman, Eric] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Childrens Hosp Pittsburgh, Dept Pediat, Pittsburgh, PA 15201 USA; [Jing, Enxuan; Biddinger, Sudha; Kahn, C.

Recent work has shown that mouse and human fibroblasts can be reprogrammed to a pluripotent state with a combination of four transcription factors. This raised the question of whether transcription factors could directly induce other defined somatic cell fates, and not only an undifferentiated state. We hypothesized that combinatorial expression of neural-lineage-specific transcription factors could directly convert fibroblasts into neurons. Starting from a pool of nineteen candidate genes, we identified a combination of only three factors, Ascl1, Brn2 ( also called Pou3f2) and Myt1l, that suffice to rapidly and efficiently convert mouse embryonic and postnatal fibroblasts into functional neurons in vitro. These induced neuronal (iN) cells express multiple neuron-specific proteins, generate action potentials and form functional synapses. Generation of iN cells from non-neural lineages could have important implications for studies of neural development, neurological disease modelling and regenerative medicine.","[Vierbuchen, Thomas; Ostermeier, Austin; Kokubu, Yuko; Wernig, Marius] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Inst Stem Cell Biol & Regenerat Med, Dept Pathol, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA; [Vierbuchen, Thomas; Ostermeier, Austin; Wernig, Marius] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Program Canc Biol, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA; [Pang, Zhiping P.; Suedhof, Thomas C.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cellular & Mol Physiol, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA; [Suedhof, Thomas C.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA","Wernig, M (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Inst Stem Cell Biol & Regenerat Med, Dept Pathol, 1050 Arastradero Rd, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA.",wernig@stanford.edu,,"Pang, Zhiping/0000-0002-6183-1233",Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine at Stanford; Donald E. and Delia B.

However, iPS cell generation is asynchronous and slow (2-3 weeks), the frequency is low (<0.1%), and DNA demethylation constitutes a bottleneck. To determine regulatory mechanisms involved in reprogramming, we generated interspecies heterokaryons ( fused mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and human fibroblasts) that induce reprogramming synchronously, frequently and fast. Here we show that reprogramming towards pluripotency in single heterokaryons is initiated without cell division or DNA replication, rapidly ( 1 day) and efficiently (70%). Short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown showed that activation-induced cytidine deaminase ( AID, also known as AICDA) is required for promoter demethylation and induction of OCT4 (also known as POU5F1) and NANOG gene expression. AID protein bound silent methylated OCT4 and NANOG promoters in fibroblasts, but not active demethylated promoters in ES cells.

Here we reveal the function in sphingolipid metabolism of the ORM genes (known as ORMDL genes in humans)-a conserved gene family that includes ORMDL3, which has recently been identified as a potential risk factor for childhood asthma. Starting from an unbiased functional genomic approach in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we identify Orm proteins as negative regulators of sphingolipid synthesis that form a conserved complex with serine palmitoyltransferase, the first and rate-limiting enzyme in sphingolipid production. We also define a regulatory pathway in which phosphorylation of Orm proteins relieves their inhibitory activity when sphingolipid production is disrupted. Changes in ORM gene expression or mutations to their phosphorylation sites cause dysregulation of sphingolipid metabolism. Our work identifies the Orm proteins as critical mediators of sphingolipid homeostasis and raises the possibility that sphingolipid misregulation contributes to the development of childhood asthma.","[Breslow, David K.; Collins, Sean R.; Weissman, Jonathan S.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Mol & Cellular Pharmacol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Breslow, David K.; Collins, Sean R.; Weissman, Jonathan S.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Breslow, David K.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Grad Program Chem & Chem Biol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Breslow, David K.; Collins, Sean R.; Weissman, Jonathan S.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Calif Inst Quantitat Biomed Res, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Bodenmiller, Bernd; Aebersold, Ruedi] ETH, Inst Mol Syst Biol, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Aebersold, Ruedi] Inst Syst Biol, Seattle, WA 98103 USA; [Aebersold, Ruedi] Univ Zurich, Fac Sci, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Simons, Kai; Shevchenko, Andrej; Ejsing, Christer S.] Max Planck Inst Mol Cell Biol & Genet, D-01307 Dresden, Germany; [Ejsing, Christer S.] Univ So Denmark, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, DK-5230 Odense, Denmark","Weissman, JS (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Mol & Cellular Pharmacol, 1700 4th St, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA.",weissman@cmp.ucsf.edu,"Ejsing, Christer/R-5922-2016","Collins, Sean/0000-0002-4276-5840; Simons, Kai/0000-0002-9231-9996; Breslow, David/0000-0003-0245-3348; Ejsing, Christer S./0000-0003-4963-0276","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB/TR 13, A1, D1]; EUFP6 PRISM; ETH Zurich; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institute of Health [N01-HV-28179]; SystemsX.ch; Swiss initiative for systems biology; Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds; Swiss National Science Foundation; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; University of California, San Francisco Strategic Asthma Basic Research Center; National Science Foundation; Fannie and John Hertz Foundation","We acknowledge A.

The recently discovered(2) transiting planet WASP-12b has a mass M = 1.4 +/- 0.1 Jupiter masses (M(J)), a mean orbital distance of only 3.1 stellar radii ( meaning it is subject to intense tidal forces), and a period of 1.1 days. Its radius 1.79 +/- 0.09 R(J) is unexpectedly large and its orbital eccentricity 0.049 +/- 0.015 is even more surprising because such close orbits are usually quickly circularized. Here we report an analysis of its properties, which reveals that the planet is losing mass to its host star at a rate of about 10(-7) M(J) per year. The planet's surface is distorted by the star's gravity and the light curve produced by its prolate shape will differ by about ten per cent from that of a spherical planet. We conclude that dissipation of the star's tidal perturbation in the planet's convective envelope provides the energy source for its large volume. We predict up to 10 mJy CO band-head (2.292 mu m) emission from a tenuous disk around the host star, made up of tidally stripped planetary gas. It may also contain a detectable resonant super-Earth, as a hypothetical perturber that continually stirs up WASP-12b's eccentricity.","[Li, Shu-lin] Peking Univ, Dept Astron, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Li, Shu-lin; Lin, Douglas N.

J.; Chevy, F.; Salomon, C.",,,Exploring the thermodynamics of a universal Fermi gas,NATURE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,BCS-BEC CROSSOVER,"One of the greatest challenges in modern physics is to understand the behaviour of an ensemble of strongly interacting particles. A class of quantum many-body systems (such as neutron star matter and cold Fermi gases) share the same universal thermodynamic properties when interactions reach the maximum effective value allowed by quantum mechanics, the so-called unitary limit(1,2). This makes it possible in principle to simulate some astrophysical phenomena inside the highly controlled environment of an atomic physics laboratory. Previous work on the thermodynamics of a two-component Fermi gas led to thermodynamic quantities averaged over the trap(3-5), making comparisons with many-body theories developed for uniform gases difficult. Here we develop a general experimental method that yields the equation of state of a uniform gas, as well as enabling a detailed comparison with existing theories(6-15). The precision of our equation of state leads to new physical insights into the unitary gas. For the unpolarized gas, we show that the low-temperature thermodynamics of the strongly interacting normal phase is well described by Fermi liquid theory, and we localize the superfluid transition. For a spin-polarized system(16-18), our equation of state at zero temperature has a 2 per cent accuracy and extends work(19,20) on the phase diagram to a new regime of precision. We show in particular that, despite strong interactions, the normal phase behaves as a mixture of two ideal gases: a Fermi gas of bare majority atoms and a non-interacting gas of dressed quasi-particles, the fermionic polarons(10,18,20-22).","[Nascimbene, S.; Navon, N.; Jiang, K.

For nanocrystalline materials, doping is of fundamental importance in stabilizing a specific crystallographic phase(1), modifying electronic properties(2-4), modulating magnetism(5) as well as tuning emission properties(6-9). Here we describe a material system in which doping influences the growth process to give simultaneous control over the crystallographic phase, size and optical emission properties of the resulting nanocrystals. We show that NaYF(4) nanocrystals can be rationally tuned in size (down to ten nanometres), phase (cubic or hexagonal) and upconversion(10-12) emission colour (green to blue) through use of trivalent lanthanide dopant ions introduced at precisely defined concentrations. We use first-principles calculations to confirm that the influence of lanthanide doping on crystal phase and size arises from a strong dependence on the size and dipole polarizability of the substitutional dopant ion. Our results suggest that the doping-induced structural and size transition, demonstrated here in NaYF(4) upconversion nanocrystals, could be extended to other lanthanide-doped nanocrystal systems for applications ranging from luminescent biological labels(12) to volumetric three-dimensional displays(13).","[Wang, Feng; Wang, Juan; Zhang, Chun; Liu, Xiaogang] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Chem, Singapore 117543, Singapore; [Han, Yu] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Div Chem & Life Sci & Engn, Membrane Res Ctr, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia; [Lim, Chin Seong; Hong, Minghui] ASTAR, Data Storage Inst, Opt Mat & Syst Div, Singapore 117608, Singapore; [Lu, Yunhao; Zhang, Chun] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Phys, Singapore 117543, Singapore; [Xu, Jun; Chen, Hongyu] Nanyang Technol Univ, Div Chem & Biol Chem, Singapore 637371, Singapore; [Hong, Minghui] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Singapore 117543, Singapore","Liu, XG (reprint author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Chem, Singapore 117543, Singapore.",chmlx@nus.edu.sg,"xu, jun/B-3105-2011; Chen, Hongyu/C-4594-2008; Zhang, Chun/F-7638-2012; Wang, Feng/E-2436-2013; LIU, XIAOGANG/A-8038-2011; Han, Yu /N-2036-2015; Lu, Yunhao/N-4555-2016; Wang, Juan/L-7686-2017","Zhang, Chun/0000-0002-1581-5806; Wang, Feng/0000-0001-9471-4386; LIU, XIAOGANG/0000-0003-2517-5790; Han, Yu /0000-0003-1462-1118; Wang, Juan/0000-0002-1340-9011","National University of Singapore (NUS); Ministry of Education of Singapore; Singapore-MIT Alliance; Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR); NUS","We thank G.

In particular, by vigorously mixing the upper ocean, they can affect the ocean's heat uptake, poleward heat transport, and hence global temperatures. Changes in the distribution and frequency of tropical cyclones could therefore become an important element of the climate response to global warming. A potential analogue to modern greenhouse conditions, the climate of the early Pliocene epoch (approximately 5 to 3 million years ago) can provide important clues to this response. Here we describe a positive feedback between hurricanes and the upper-ocean circulation in the tropical Pacific Ocean that may have been essential for maintaining warm, El Nino-like conditions(4-6) during the early Pliocene. This feedback is based on the ability of hurricanes to warm water parcels that travel towards the Equator at shallow depths and then resurface in the eastern equatorial Pacific as part of the ocean's wind-driven circulation(7,8). In the present climate, very few hurricane tracks intersect the parcel trajectories; consequently, there is little heat exchange between waters at such depths and the surface. More frequent and/or stronger hurricanes in the central Pacific imply greater heating of the parcels, warmer temperatures in the eastern equatorial Pacific, warmer tropics and, in turn, even more hurricanes. Using a downscaling hurricane model(9,10), we show dramatic shifts in the tropical cyclone distribution for the early Pliocene that favour this feedback. Further calculations with a coupled climate model support our conclusions. The proposed feedback should be relevant to past equable climates and potentially to contemporary climate change.","[Fedorov, Alexey V.; Brierley, Christopher M.] Yale Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Emanuel, Kerry] MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Fedorov, AV (reprint author), Yale Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, POB 6666, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",alexey.fedorov@yale.edu,"fedorov, alexey/F-1879-2010; Brierley, Chris/A-8417-2009","Brierley, Chris/0000-0002-9195-6731",NSF; Department of Energy Office of Science; David and Lucile Packard Foundation,"We thank G.

Beyond the micrometre scale, however, no firm evidence has previously existed that spatially segregated biogeochemical processes can be coupled by electric currents in nature. Here we provide evidence that electric currents running through defaunated sediment couple oxygen consumption at the sediment surface to oxidation of hydrogen sulphide and organic carbon deep within the sediment. Altering the oxygen concentration in the sea water overlying the sediment resulted in a rapid (<1-h) change in the hydrogen sulphide concentration within the sediment more than 12 mm below the oxic zone, a change explicable by transmission of electrons but not by diffusion of molecules. Mass balances indicated that more than 40% of total oxygen consumption in the sediment was driven by electrons conducted from the anoxic zone. A distinct pH peak in the oxic zone could be explained by electrochemical oxygen reduction, but not by any conventional sets of aerobic sediment processes. We suggest that the electric current was conducted by bacterial nanowires combined with pyrite, soluble electron shuttles and outer-membrane cytochromes. Electrical communication between distant chemical and biological processes in nature adds a new dimension to our understanding of biogeochemistry and microbial ecology.","[Nielsen, Lars Peter] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biol Sci, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Risgaard-Petersen, Nils] Aarhus Univ, Ctr Geomicrobiol, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Fossing, Henrik; Christensen, Peter Bondo] Aarhus Univ, Natl Environm Res Inst, Dept Marine Ecol, DK-8600 Silkeborg, Denmark; [Sayama, Mikio] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058569, Japan","Nielsen, LP (reprint author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Ny Munkegade 114, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",biolpn@biology.au.dk,"Risgaard-Petersen, Nils/J-2479-2013; Fossing, Henrik/J-5646-2013; Nielsen, Lars Peter/J-7401-2013","Nielsen, Lars Peter/0000-0002-7269-4860",Aarhus University Research Foundation; Danish National Research Foundation; Max Planck Society; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science,"This research was financially supported by the Aarhus University Research Foundation, the Danish National Research Foundation (N.R.-P.), the Max Planck Society (N.R.-P.) and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science ( M.

Here we report that melanosomes (colour-bearing organelles) are not only preserved in the pennaceous feathers of early birds, but also in an identical manner in integumentary filaments of non-avian dinosaurs, thus refuting recent claims(13-16) that the filaments are partially decayed dermal collagen fibres. Examples of both eumelanosomes and phaeomelanosomes have been identified, and they are often preserved in life position within the structure of partially degraded feathers and filaments. Furthermore, the data here provide empirical evidence for reconstructing the colours and colour patterning of these extinct birds and theropod dinosaurs: for example, the dark-coloured stripes on the tail of the theropod dinosaur Sinosauropteryx can reasonably be inferred to have exhibited chestnut to reddish-brown tones.","[Kearns, Stuart L.; Benton, Michael J.] Univ Bristol, Dept Earth Sci, Bristol BS8 1RJ, Avon, England; [Zhang, Fucheng; Zhou, Zhonghe; Xu, Xing; Wang, Xiaolin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Paleontol & Paleoanthropol, Key Lab Evolutionary Systemat Vertebrates, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [Orr, Patrick J.] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Geol Sci, Dublin 4, Ireland; [Johnson, Diane] Open Univ, Planetary & Space Sci Res Inst, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England","Benton, MJ (reprint author), Univ Bristol, Dept Earth Sci, Bristol BS8 1RJ, Avon, England.",mike.benton@bristol.ac.uk; zhonghe@yeah.net,"Benton, Michael/A-5639-2008","Benton, Michael/0000-0002-4323-1824; Orr, Patrick/0000-0002-6740-1656",NERC; MST of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China,"We thank M.

The discovery that terrestrial insects (Hexapoda) are more closely related to aquatic Crustacea than to the terrestrial centipedes and millipedes(2,8) (Myriapoda) was an early, if exceptional, success. More typically, analyses based on limited samples of taxa and genes have generated results that are inconsistent, weakly supported and highly sensitive to analytical conditions(7,9,10). Here we present strongly supported results from likelihood, Bayesian and parsimony analyses of over 41 kilobases of aligned DNA sequence from 62 single-copy nuclear protein-coding genes from 75 arthropod species. These species represent every major arthropod lineage, plus five species of tardigrades and onychophorans as outgroups. Our results strongly support Pancrustacea (Hexapoda plus Crustacea) but also strongly favour the traditional morphology-based Mandibulata(11) (Myriapoda plus Pancrustacea) over the molecule-based Paradoxopoda (Myriapoda plus Chelicerata)(2,5,12). In addition to Hexapoda, Pancrustacea includes three major extant lineages of 'crustaceans', each spanning a significant range of morphological disparity. These are Oligostraca (ostracods, mystacocarids, branchiurans and pentastomids), Vericrustacea (malacostracans, thecostracans, copepods and branchiopods) and Xenocarida (cephalocarids and remipedes). Finally, within Pancrustacea we identify Xenocarida as the long-sought sister group to the Hexapoda, a result confirming that 'crustaceans' are not monophyletic. These results provide a statistically well-supported phylogenetic framework for the largest animal phylum and represent a step towards ending the often-heated, century-long debate on arthropod relationships.","[Ball, Bernard; Cunningham, Clifford W.] Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Regier, Jerome C.; Shultz, Jeffrey W.; Zwick, Andreas; Hussey, April] Univ Maryland, Inst Biotechnol, Ctr Biosyst Res, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Shultz, Jeffrey W.] Univ Maryland, Dept Entomol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Shultz, Jeffrey W.] Univ Maryland, Inst Biosci & Biotechnol Res, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Wetzer, Regina; Martin, Joel W.] Nat Hist Museum Los Angeles Cty, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA","Cunningham, CW (reprint author), Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",cliff@duke.edu,"Zwick, Andreas/A-5735-2015; Cunningham, Clifford/B-9807-2014","Cunningham, Clifford/0000-0002-5434-5122",Maryland Agricultural Experiment Station; Whiteley Center; US National Science Foundation,"C.

To explore the link between the birth of ancient microRNAs and body plan evolution, we set out to determine the ancient sites of activity of conserved bilaterian microRNA families in a comparative approach. We reason that any specific localization shared between protostomes and deuterostomes (the two major superphyla of bilaterian animals) should probably reflect an ancient specificity of that microRNA in their last common ancestor. Here, we investigate the expression of conserved bilaterian microRNAs in Platynereis dumerilii, a protostome retaining ancestral bilaterian features(3,4), in Capitella, another marine annelid, in the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus, a deuterostome, and in sea anemone Nematostella, representing an outgroup to the bilaterians. Our comparative data indicate that the oldest known animal microRNA, miR-100, and the related miR-125 and let-7 were initially active in neurosecretory cells located around the mouth. Other sets of ancient microRNAs were first present in locomotor ciliated cells, specific brain centres, or, more broadly, one of four major organ systems: central nervous system, sensory tissue, musculature and gut. These findings reveal that microRNA evolution and the establishment of tissue identities were closely coupled in bilaterian evolution. Also, they outline a minimum set of cell types and tissues that existed in the protostome-deuterostome ancestor.","[Christodoulou, Foteini; Raible, Florian; Tomer, Raju; Simakov, Oleg; Klaus, Sebastian; Snyman, Heidi; Arendt, Detlev] European Mol Biol Lab, Dev Biol Unit, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Raible, Florian; Trachana, Kalliopi; Bork, Peer] European Mol Biol Lab, Computat Biol Unit, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Hannon, Gregory J.] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA","Arendt, D (reprint author), European Mol Biol Lab, Dev Biol Unit, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany.",arendt@embl.de,"Tomer, Raju/F-2335-2010; Raible, Florian/G-6019-2011; Bork, Peer/F-1813-2013; Simakov, Oleg/G-4572-2015","Bork, Peer/0000-0002-2627-833X; Simakov, Oleg/0000-0002-3585-4511","NCI NIH HHS [P01 CA013106-39, P01 CA013106, P01 CA013106-38]",,,38,152,159,2,45,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,25-Feb,2010,463,7284,,,,,1084,U105,,10.1038/nature08744,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,563DR,WOS:000275108400037,20118916.0,No,,,11/20/17,detlev,arendt,male,1,2,na,na

Although there is a large body of behavioural and anthropological evidence consistent with the predictions of these theories(1,4-6), there is no direct neural evidence for the existence of inequality-averse preferences. Such evidence would be especially useful because some behaviours that are consistent with a dislike for unequal outcomes could also be explained by concerns for social image(7) or reciprocity(8,9), which do not require a direct aversion towards inequality. Here we use functional MRI to test directly for the existence of inequality-averse social preferences in the human brain. Inequality was created by recruiting pairs of subjects and giving one of them a large monetary endowment. While both subjects evaluated further monetary transfers from the experimenter to themselves and to the other participant, we measured neural responses in the ventral striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, two areas that have been shown to be involved in the valuation of monetary and primary rewards in both social and non-social contexts(10-14). Consistent with inequality-averse models of social preferences, we find that activity in these areas was more responsive to transfers to others than to self in the 'high-pay' subject, whereas the activity of the 'low-pay' subject showed the opposite pattern. These results provide direct evidence for the validity of this class of models, and also show that the brain's reward circuitry is sensitive to both advantageous and disadvantageous inequality.","[Rangel, Antonio; Camerer, Colin F.; O'Doherty, John P.] CALTECH, Div Humanities & Social Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Tricomi, Elizabeth] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Psychol, Newark, NJ 07102 USA; [O'Doherty, John P.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Psychol, Dublin 2, Ireland; [O'Doherty, John P.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Inst Neurosci, Dublin 2, Ireland","O'Doherty, JP (reprint author), CALTECH, Div Humanities & Social Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",johnpodoherty@gmail.com,"O'Doherty, John/F-1204-2013","Tricomi, Elizabeth/0000-0002-3659-2656",US National Science Foundation [0617174]; Human Frontiers of Science Program; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation; Caltech Brain Imaging Center,"We thank B.

The IRE1-XBP1/Hac1 pathway is a major branch of the UPR that has been conserved from yeast to human(2-6). X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) is required for the differentiation of the highly secretory plasma cells of the mammalian adaptive immune system(7,8), but recent work also points to reciprocal interactions between the UPR and other aspects of immunity and inflammation(9-11). We have been studying innate immunity in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, having established a principal role for a conserved PMK-1 p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in mediating resistance to microbial pathogens(12). Here we show that during C. elegans development, XBP-1 has an essential role in protecting the host during activation of innate immunity. Activation of the PMK-1-mediated response to infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa induces the XBP-1-dependent UPR. Whereas a loss-of-function xbp-1 mutant develops normally in the presence of relatively non-pathogenic bacteria, infection of the xbp-1 mutant with P. aeruginosa leads to disruption of ER morphology and larval lethality. Unexpectedly, the larval lethality phenotype on pathogenic P. aeruginosa is suppressed by loss of PMK-1-mediated immunity. Furthermore, hyperactivation of PMK-1 causes larval lethality in the xbp-1 mutant even in the absence of pathogenic bacteria. Our data establish innate immunity as a physiologically relevant inducer of ER stress during C. elegans development and indicate that an ancient, conserved role for XBP-1 may be to protect the host organism from the detrimental effects of mounting an innate immune response to microbes.","[Richardson, Claire E.; Kooistra, Tristan; Kim, Dennis H.] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Kim, DH (reprint author), MIT, Dept Biol, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",dhkim@mit.edu,,,"NIH [DK43351, DK57521, R01-GM084477]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Burroughs Wellcome Fund; Ellison Medical Foundation","Electron microscopy was performed by M.

The combination of Oct4 (also known as Pou5f1), Sox2 and Klf4 (which we term OSK) constitutes the minimal requirement for generating iPS cells from mouse embryonic fibroblasts. These cells are thought to resemble embryonic stem cells (ESCs) on the basis of global gene expression analyses; however, few studies have tested the ability and efficiency of iPS cells to contribute to chimaerism, colonization of germ tissues, and most importantly, germ-line transmission and live birth from iPS cells produced by tetraploid complementation. Using genomic analyses of ESC genes that have roles in pluripotency and fusion-mediated somatic cell reprogramming, here we show that the transcription factor Tbx3 significantly improves the quality of iPS cells. iPS cells generated with OSK and Tbx3 (OSKT) are superior in both germ-cell contribution to the gonads and germline transmission frequency. However, global gene expression profiling could not distinguish between OSK and OSKT iPS cells. Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analysis of Tbx3-binding sites in ESCs suggests that Tbx3 regulates pluripotency-associated and reprogramming factors, in addition to sharing many common downstream regulatory targets with Oct4, Sox2, Nanog and Smad1. This study underscores the intrinsic qualitative differences between iPS cells generated by different methods, and highlights the need to rigorously characterize iPS cells beyond in vitro studies.","[Han, Jianyong; Yuan, Ping; Zhang, Jinqiu; Soh, Boon Seng; Li, Pin; Lim, Siew Lan; Cao, Suying; Tay, Junliang; Lufkin, Thomas; Ng, Huck-Hui; Tam, Wai-Leong; Lim, Bing] Stem Cell Dev Biol, Singapore 138648, Singapore; [Orlov, Yuriy L.] Genome Inst Singapore, Syst Biol, Singapore 138648, Singapore; [Han, Jianyong] China Agr Univ, Coll Biol Sci, State Key Lab Agrobiotechnol, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Yang, Henry] Singapore Immunol Network, Singapore 138648, Singapore; [Ng, Huck-Hui] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Biol Sci, Singapore 117543, Singapore; [Lim, Bing] Harvard Med Sch, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Ctr Life Sci, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Tam, WL (reprint author), Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, 9 Cambridge Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",tamwl@wi.mit.edu; limb1@gis.a-star.edu.sg,"Ng, Huck Hui/A-1135-2009; Orlov, Yuriy/F-1520-2013","Orlov, Yuriy/0000-0003-0587-1609; NG, HUCK HUI/0000-0001-6352-8417; Tam, Wai Leong/0000-0003-2365-5264; Lufkin, Thomas/0000-0002-7902-4771","Agency for Science, Technology and Research (Singapore); Singapore Stem Cell Consortium [SSCC-06-003]; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [DK047636, AI54973]; A*STAR Post-doctoral Fellowship","This work is supported by the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (Singapore) and the Singapore Stem Cell Consortium grant (SSCC-06-003).

The extent of this reprogramming and its molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. We previously showed that the cytidine deaminases AID and APOBEC1 can deaminate 5-methylcytosine in vitro and in Escherichia coli, and in the mouse are expressed in tissues in which demethylation occurs(10). Here we profiled DNA methylation throughout the genome by unbiased bisulphite next generation sequencing(11-13) in wild-type and AID-deficient mouse PGCs at embryonic day (E) 13.5. Wild-type PGCs revealed marked genome-wide erasure of methylation to a level below that of methylation deficient (Np95(-/-), also called Uhrf1(-/-)) embryonic stem cells, with female PGCs being less methylated than male ones. By contrast, AID-deficient PGCs were up to three times more methylated than wild-type ones; this substantial difference occurred throughout the genome, with introns, intergenic regions and transposons being relatively more methylated than exons. Relative hypermethylation in AID-deficient PGCs was confirmed by analysis of individual loci in the genome. Our results reveal that erasure of DNA methylation in the germ line is a global process, hence limiting the potential for transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. AID deficiency interferes with genome-wide erasure of DNA methylation patterns, indicating that AID has a critical function in epigenetic reprogramming and potentially in restricting the inheritance of epimutations in mammals.","[Feng, Suhua; Cokus, Shawn J.; Pellegrini, Matteo; Jacobsen, Steven E.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Mol Cell & Dev Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Popp, Christian; Dean, Wendy; Reik, Wolf] Babraham Inst, Lab Dev Genet & Imprinting, Cambridge CB22 3AT, England; [Popp, Christian; Dean, Wendy; Reik, Wolf] Univ Cambridge, Ctr Trophoblast Res, Cambridge CB2 3EG, England; [Andrews, Simon] Babraham Inst, Bioinformat Grp, Cambridge CB22 3AT, England; [Jacobsen, Steven E.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Jacobsen, SE (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Mol Cell & Dev Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",jacobsen@ucla.edu; wolf.reik@bbsrc.ac.uk,"Reik, Wolf/I-6794-2012","Reik, Wolf/0000-0003-0216-9881",BBSRC; MRC; EU NoE The Epigenome; CellCentric; HHMI; NSF; NIH,"We thank H.

Homozygous deletions in cancer genomes occur over recessive cancer genes, where they can confer selective growth advantage, and over fragile sites, where they are thought to reflect an increased local rate of DNA breakage. However, most homozygous deletions in cancer genomes are unexplained. Here we identified 2,428 somatic homozygous deletions in 746 cancer cell lines. These overlie 11% of protein-coding genes that, therefore, are not mandatory for survival of human cells. We derived structural signatures that distinguish between homozygous deletions over recessive cancer genes and fragile sites. Application to clusters of unexplained homozygous deletions suggests that many are in regions of inherent fragility, whereas a small subset overlies recessive cancer genes. The results illustrate how structural signatures can be used to distinguish between the influences of mutation and selection in cancer genomes. The extensive copy number, genotyping, sequence and expression data available for this large series of publicly available cancer cell lines renders them informative reagents for future studies of cancer biology and drug discovery.","[Bignell, Graham R.; Greenman, Chris D.; Davies, Helen; Butler, Adam P.; Edkins, Sarah; Andrews, Jenny M.; Buck, Gemma; Chen, Lina; Beare, David; Latimer, Calli; Widaa, Sara; Hinton, Jonathon; Fahey, Ciara; Fu, Beiyuan; Swamy, Sajani; Dalgliesh, Gillian L.; Deloukas, Panos; Yang, Fengtang; Campbell, Peter J.; Futreal, P.

Here we present high-resolution analyses of somatic copy-number alterations (SCNAs) from 3,131 cancer specimens, belonging largely to 26 histological types. We identify 158 regions of focal SCNA that are altered at significant frequency across several cancer types, of which 122 cannot be explained by the presence of a known cancer target gene located within these regions. Several gene families are enriched among these regions of focal SCNA, including the BCL2 family of apoptosis regulators and the NF-kappa B pathway. We show that cancer cells containing amplifications surrounding the MCL1 and BCL2L1 anti-apoptotic genes depend on the expression of these genes for survival. Finally, we demonstrate that a large majority of SCNAs identified in individual cancer types are present in several cancer types.","[Beroukhim, Rameen; Mermel, Craig H.; Wei, Guo; Raychaudhuri, Soumya;

These structures show that side chain contacts to ATP.Mg are released after adenylation to facilitate a 130 degree rotation of the Cys domain during thioester bond formation that is accompanied by remodelling of key structural elements including the helix that contains the E1 catalytic cysteine, the crossover and re-entry loops, and refolding of two helices that are required for adenylation. These changes displace side chains required for adenylation with side chains required for thioester bond formation. Mutational and biochemical analyses indicate these mechanisms are conserved in other E1s.","[Lu, Xuequan; Tan, Derek S.] Sloan Kettering Inst, Mol Pharmacol & Chem Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Olsen, Shaun K.; Capili, Allan D.; Lima, Christopher D.] Sloan Kettering Inst, Struct Biol Program, New York, NY 10065 USA","Tan, DS (reprint author), Sloan Kettering Inst, Mol Pharmacol & Chem Program, New York, NY 10065 USA.",tand@mskcc.org; limac@mskcc.org,,"Olsen, Shaun/0000-0002-1265-7101; Lima, Christopher/0000-0002-9163-6092","NCRR at the NIH [RR-15301]; US Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-AC02-06CH11357]; NIH [R01 AI068038, R01 GM065872, F32 GM075695]; NYSTAR Watson Investigator Program; Rita Allen Foundation","We thank A.

However, even genetically identical organisms in homogeneous environments vary, indicating that randomness in developmental processes such as gene expression may also generate diversity. To examine the consequences of gene expression variability in multicellular organisms, we studied intestinal specification in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans in which wild-type cell fate is invariant and controlled by a small transcriptional network. Mutations in elements of this network can have indeterminate effects: some mutant embryos fail to develop intestinal cells, whereas others produce intestinal precursors. By counting transcripts of the genes in this network in individual embryos, we show that the expression of an otherwise redundant gene becomes highly variable in the mutants and that this variation is subjected to a threshold, producing an ON/OFF expression pattern of the master regulatory gene of intestinal differentiation. Our results demonstrate that mutations in developmental networks can expose otherwise buffered stochastic variability in gene expression, leading to pronounced phenotypic variation.","[Raj, Arjun; Rifkin, Scott A.; van Oudenaarden, Alexander] MIT, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Raj, Arjun; Rifkin, Scott A.; Andersen, Erik; van Oudenaarden, Alexander] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Andersen, Erik] Princeton Univ, Lewis Sigler Inst Integrat Genom, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","van Oudenaarden, A (reprint author), MIT, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",avano@mit.edu,,"Rifkin, Scott/0000-0001-8476-3256; Raj, Arjun/0000-0002-2915-6960; Andersen, Erik/0000-0003-0229-9651",National Institutes of Health (NIH); National Science Foundation [DMS-0603392]; Burroughs-Wellcome Fund; NIH NRSA [5F32GM080966],We thank H.

The size of the emitting zone and the location of this region relative to the central supermassive black hole are, however, poorly known, with estimates ranging from light-hours to a light-year or more. Here we report the coincidence of a gamma (gamma)-ray flare with a dramatic change of optical polarization angle. This provides evidence for co-spatiality of optical and gamma-ray emission regions and indicates a highly ordered jet magnetic field. The results also require a non-axisymmetric structure of the emission zone, implying a curved trajectory for the emitting material within the jet, with the dissipation region located at a considerable distance from the black hole, at about 10(5) gravitational radii.","[Ackermann, M.; Ajello, M.; Bechtol, K.; Berenji, B.; Blandford, R.

The nuclear runaway that leads to the explosion could start in a white dwarf gradually accumulating matter from a companion star until it reaches the Chandrasekhar limit(3), or could be triggered by the merger of two white dwarfs in a compact binary system(4,5). The X-ray signatures of these two possible paths are very different. Whereas no strong electromagnetic emission is expected in the merger scenario until shortly before the supernova, the white dwarf accreting material from the normal star becomes a source of copious X-rays for about 10(7) years before the explosion. This offers a means of determining which path dominates. Here we report that the observed X-ray flux from six nearby elliptical galaxies and galaxy bulges is a factor of similar to 30-50 less than predicted in the accretion scenario, based upon an estimate of the supernova rate from their K-band luminosities. We conclude that no more than about five per cent of type Ia supernovae in early-type galaxies can be produced by white dwarfs in accreting binary systems, unless their progenitors are much younger than the bulk of the stellar population in these galaxies, or explosions of sub-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs make a significant contribution to the supernova rate.","[Gilfanov, Marat; Bogdan, Akos] Max Planck Inst Astrophys, D-85741 Garching, Germany; [Gilfanov, Marat] Space Res Inst, Moscow 117997, Russia","Gilfanov, M (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Astrophys, Karl Schwarzschild Str 1, D-85741 Garching, Germany.",gilfanov@mpa-garching.mpg.de,"Gilfanov, Marat/K-6867-2017",,NASA; NSF,"We thank F.

This effect, known as gravitational redshift, is important to the operation of the global positioning system(2), timekeeping(3,4) and future experiments with ultra-precise, space-based clocks(5) (such as searches for variations in fundamental constants). The gravitational redshift has been measured using clocks on a tower(6), an aircraft(7) and a rocket(8), currently reaching an accuracy of 7 x 10(-5). Here we show that laboratory experiments based on quantum interference of atoms(9,10) enable a much more precise measurement, yielding an accuracy of 7 x 10(-9). Our result supports the view that gravity is a manifestation of space-time curvature, an underlying principle of general relativity that has come under scrutiny in connection with the search for a theory of quantum gravity(11). Improving the redshift measurement is particularly important because this test has been the least accurate among the experiments that are required to support curved space-time theories(1).","[Mueller, Holger; Chu, Steven] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Mueller, Holger; Chu, Steven] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Peters, Achim] Humboldt Univ, Inst Phys, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Chu, Steven] US DOE, Washington, DC 20585 USA","Muller, H (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, 366 Le Conte Hall,MS 7300, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",hm@berkeley.edu,"Peters, Achim/G-3742-2010; Mueller, Holger/E-3194-2015",,"National Science Foundation [9320142, 0400866, 0652332]; Air Force Office of Scientific Research; Department of Energy; David and Lucile Packard Foundation; National Institute of Standards and Technology [60NANB9D9169]; European Science Foundation; European Space Agency; German Space Agency DLR [DLR 50 WM 0346]","We thank F.

As the mantle upwells and decompresses across its solidus, it partially melts. These low-density melts rise to the surface and form the continental and oceanic crusts, driving the differentiation of the silicate part of the Earth. Because many trace elements, such as heat-producing U, Th and K, as well as the noble gases, preferentially partition into melts (here referred to as incompatible elements), melt extraction concentrates these elements into the crust (or atmosphere in the case of noble gases), where nearly half of the Earth's budget of these elements now resides(2). In contrast, the upper mantle, as sampled by mid-ocean ridge basalts, is highly depleted in incompatible elements, suggesting a complementary relationship with the crust. Mass balance arguments require that the other half of these incompatible elements be hidden in the Earth's interior. Hypotheses abound for the origin of this hidden reservoir(3-6). The most widely held view has been that this hidden reservoir represents primordial material never processed by melting or degassing. Here, we suggest that a necessary by-product of whole-mantle convection during the Earth's first billion years is deep and hot melting, resulting in the generation of dense liquids that crystallized and sank into the lower mantle. These sunken lithologies would have 'primordial' chemical signatures despite a non-primordial origin.","[Lee, Cin-Ty A.; Luffi, Peter; Hoeink, Tobias; Dasgupta, Rajdeep] Rice Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Li, Jie] Univ Michigan, Dept Geol Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Hernlund, John] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Lee, CTA (reprint author), Rice Univ, Dept Earth Sci, MS-126,6100 Main St, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",ctlee@rice.edu,"Lee, Cin-Ty/A-5469-2008; Dasgupta, Rajdeep/C-7252-2009; Luffi, Peter/C-1229-2013; Hernlund, John/A-8931-2014","Dasgupta, Rajdeep/0000-0001-5392-415X; Hernlund, John/0000-0003-1008-0182",Packard Foundation; NSF; University of Illinois,"The ideas for this paper were conceived at Rice University and fine-tuned at the 2008 Cooperative Institute for Deep Earth Research workshop at the Kavli Institute.

Non-biological processes are known to produce morphologies similar to some microfossils(4,5), and hydrothermal fluids have the potential to produce abiotic organic compounds with depleted carbon isotope values(6), making it difficult to establish unambiguous traces of life. Here we report the discovery of a population of large (up to about 300 mu m in diameter) carbonaceous spheroidal microstructures in Mesoarchaean shales and siltstones of the Moodies Group, South Africa, the Earth's oldest siliciclastic alluvial to tidal-estuarine deposits(7). These microstructures are interpreted as organic-walled microfossils on the basis of petrographic and geochemical evidence for their endogenicity and syngeneity, their carbonaceous composition, cellular morphology and ultrastructure, occurrence in populations, taphonomic features of soft wall deformation, and the geological context plausible for life, as well as a lack of abiotic explanation falsifying a biological origin. These are the oldest and largest Archaean organic-walled spheroidal microfossils reported so far. Our observations suggest that relatively large microorganisms cohabited with earlier reported benthic microbial mats(8) in the photic zone of marginal marine siliciclastic environments 3.2 billion years ago.","[Javaux, Emmanuelle J.] Univ Liege, Dept Geol, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; [Marshall, Craig P.] Univ Kansas, Dept Geol, Lawrence, KS 66044 USA; [Bekker, Andrey] Univ Manitoba, Dept Geol Sci, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada","Javaux, EJ (reprint author), Univ Liege, Dept Geol, 17 Allee 6 Aout B18, B-4000 Liege, Belgium.",ej.javaux@ulg.ac.be,,,University of Liege Impulsion [CFRA0805]; University of Liege [RCFRA0036-J]; National Science Foundation [EAR-937 05-45484]; NASA Astrobiology Institute [NNA04CC09A]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Australian Research Council,"We thank M.

Although echolocation is usually associated with bats, it is not characteristic of all bats(2,3). Most echolocating bats produce signals in the larynx, but within one family of mainly non-echolocating species (Pteropodidae), a few species use echolocation sounds produced by tongue clicks(4,5). Here we demonstrate, using data obtained from micro-computed tomography scans of 26 species (n = 35 fluid-preserved bats), that proximal articulation of the stylohyal bone (part of the mammalian hyoid apparatus) with the tympanic bone always distinguishes laryngeally echolocating bats from all other bats (that is, non-echolocating pteropodids and those that echo-locate with tongue clicks). In laryngeally echolocating bats, the proximal end of the stylohyal bone directly articulates with the tympanic bone and is often fused with it. Previous research on the morphology of the stylohyal bone in the oldest known fossil bat (Onychonycteris finneyi) suggested that it did not echolocate(6), but our findings suggest that O. finneyi may have used laryngeal echolocation because its stylohyal bones may have articulated with its tympanic bones. The present findings reopen basic questions about the timing and the origin of flight and echolocation in the early evolution of bats. Our data also provide an independent anatomical character by which to distinguish laryngeally echolocating bats from other bats.","[Veselka, Nina; Fenton, M.

Studies based on mitochondrial(1) and small sets of nuclear markers(2) have shown that these hunter-gatherers, known as Khoisan, San, or Bushmen, are genetically divergent from other humans(1,3). However, until now, fully sequenced human genomes have been limited to recently diverged populations(4-8). Here we present the complete genome sequences of an indigenous hunter-gatherer from the Kalahari Desert and a Bantu from southern Africa, as well as protein-coding regions from an additional three hunter-gatherers from disparate regions of the Kalahari. We characterize the extent of whole-genome and exome diversity among the five men, reporting 1.3 million novel DNA differences genome-wide, including 13,146 novel amino acid variants. In terms of nucleotide substitutions, the Bushmen seem to be, on average, more different from each other than, for example, a European and an Asian. Observed genomic differences between the hunter-gatherers and others may help to pinpoint genetic adaptations to an agricultural lifestyle. Adding the described variants to current databases will facilitate inclusion of southern Africans in medical research efforts, particularly when family and medical histories can be correlated with genome-wide data.","[Schuster, Stephan C.; Miller, Webb; Ratan, Aakrosh; Tomsho, Lynn P.; Giardine, Belinda; Kasson, Lindsay R.; Harris, Robert S.; Zhao, Fangqing; Qi, Ji; Sun, Yazhou; Drautz, Daniela I.; Wang, Qingyu; Burhans, Richard; Riemer, Cathy; Wittekindt, Nicola E.; Buboltz, Anne M.; Zhang, Zhenhai; Ma, Qianyi; Gajewski, John; Zhang, Yu; Pugh, B.

How instructive experience acts on the juvenile brain to trigger behavioural learning remains unknown. In vitro studies show that forms of synaptic strengthening thought to underlie learning are accompanied by an increase in the stability, number and size of dendritic spines, which are the major sites of excitatory synaptic transmission in the vertebrate brain(1-7). In vivo imaging studies in sensory cortical regions reveal that these structural features can be affected by disrupting sensory experience and that spine turnover increases during sensitive periods for sensory map formation(8-12). These observations support two hypotheses: first, the increased capacity for behavioural learning during a sensitive period is associated with enhanced spine dynamics on sensorimotor neurons important for the learned behaviour; second, instructive experience rapidly stabilizes and strengthens these dynamic spines. Here we report a test of these hypotheses using two-photon in vivo imaging to measure spine dynamics in zebra finches, which learn to sing by imitating a tutor song during a juvenile sensitive period(13,14). Spine dynamics were measured in the forebrain nucleus HVC, the proximal site where auditory information merges with an explicit song motor representation(15-19), immediately before and after juvenile finches first experienced tutor song(20). Higher levels of spine turnover before tutoring correlated with a greater capacity for subsequent song imitation. In juveniles with high levels of spine turnover, hearing a tutor song led to the rapid (similar to 24-h) stabilization, accumulation and enlargement of dendritic spines in HVC. Moreover, in vivo intracellular recordings made immediately before and after the first day of tutoring revealed robust enhancement of synaptic activity in HVC. These findings suggest that behavioural learning results when instructive experience is able to rapidly stabilize and strengthen synapses on sensorimotor neurons important for the control of the learned behaviour.","[Roberts, Todd F.; Tschida, Katherine A.; Klein, Marguerita E.; Mooney, Richard] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Neurobiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA","Mooney, R (reprint author), Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Neurobiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA.",mooney@neuro.duke.edu,,,US National Science Foundation (NSF); US National Institutes of Health (NIH); Howard Hughes Medical Institute,"We thank M.

Here we show that a mutation in Rere (also known as atrophin2) leads to the formation of asymmetrical somites in mouse embryos, similar to embryos deprived of retinoic acid(1-4). Furthermore, we also demonstrate that Rere controls retinoic acid signalling, which is required to maintain somite symmetry by interacting with Fgf8 in the left-right signalling pathway. Rere forms a complex with Nr2f2, p300 (also known as Ep300) and a retinoic acid receptor, which is recruited to the retinoic acid regulatory element of retinoic acid targets, such as the Rarb promoter. Furthermore, the knockdown of Nr2f2 and/or Rere decreases retinoic acid signalling, suggesting that this complex is required to promote transcriptional activation of retinoic acid targets. The asymmetrical expression of Nr2f2 in the pre-somitic mesoderm overlaps with the asymmetry of the retinoic acid signalling response, supporting its implication in the control of somitic symmetry. Misregulation of this mechanism could be involved in symmetry defects of the human spine, such as those observed in patients with scoliosis.","[Vilhais-Neto, Goncalo C.; Maruhashi, Mitsuji; Smith, Karen T.; Workman, Jerry L.; Pourquie, Olivier] Stowers Inst Med Res, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; [Maruhashi, Mitsuji; Pourquie, Olivier] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; [Vasseur-Cognet, Mireille] Univ Paris 05, Inst Cochin, CNRS,UMR 8104, Dept Endocrinol Metab & Canc,Inserm,U567, Paris, France; [Peterson, Andrew S.] Genentech Inc, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Pourquie, Olivier] Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Kansas City, KS 66160 USA","Pourquie, O (reprint author), Univ Strasbourg, INSERM, U964, Inst Genet & Biol Mol & Cellulaire,CNRS,UMR 7104, F-67400 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France.",pourquie@igbmc.fr,"Vasseur, Mireille/L-6958-2017","Pourquie, Olivier/0000-0001-5189-1227","Portuguese Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT); American Cancer Society; ALFEDIAM-GlaxoSmithKline; Bonus Qualite Recherche, Universite Paris Descartes; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Stowers Institute for Medical Research; Muscular Dystrophy Association","We thank members of the Pourquie laboratory for discussions and comments on the manuscript, H.

Although it was postulated 25 years ago that CHARGE syndrome results from the abnormal development of the neural crest, this hypothesis remained untested(5). Here we show that, in both humans and Xenopus, CHD7 is essential for the formation of multipotent migratory neural crest (NC), a transient cell population that is ectodermal in origin but undergoes a major transcriptional reprogramming event to acquire a remarkably broad differentiation potential and ability to migrate throughout the body, giving rise to craniofacial bones and cartilages, the peripheral nervous system, pigmentation and cardiac structures(6,7). We demonstrate that CHD7 is essential for activation of the NC transcriptional circuitry, including Sox9, Twist and Slug. In Xenopus embryos, knockdown of Chd7 or overexpression of its catalytically inactive form recapitulates all major features of CHARGE syndrome. In human NC cells CHD7 associates with PBAF (polybromo-and BRG1-associated factor-containing complex) 8 and both remodellers occupy a NC-specific distal SOX9 enhancer(9) and a conserved genomic element located upstream of the TWIST1 gene. Consistently, during embryogenesis CHD7 and PBAF cooperate to promote NC gene expression and cell migration. Our work identifies an evolutionarily conserved role for CHD7 in orchestrating NC gene expression programs, provides insights into the synergistic control of distal elements by chromatin remodellers, illuminates the pathoembryology of CHARGE syndrome, and suggests a broader function for CHD7 in the regulation of cell motility.","[Bajpai, Ruchi; Chen, Denise A.; Rada-Iglesias, Alvaro; Swigut, Tomek; Wysocka, Joanna] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Chem & Syst Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Xiong, Yiqin] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Cardiovasc Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Helms, Jill; Chang, Ching-Pin] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Surg, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Wysocka, Joanna] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Dev Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Zhang, Junmei] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Prot Chem Technol Ctr, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Zhao, Yingming] Univ Chicago, Ben May Dept Canc Res, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Wysocka, J (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Chem & Syst Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",wysocka@stanford.edu,"; Xiong, Yiqin/H-1710-2012","Bajpai, Ruchi/0000-0001-7737-3567; Rada-Iglesias, Alvaro/0000-0001-7137-1341; ","CIRM SEED [RS1-00323]; Keck Foundation; Searle Scholar Award; EMBO; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R01DK082664, R01HL085345]; March of Dimes [6-FY06-335]; Oak Foundation","We thank laboratory members for input during the course of this work; S.

It is driven by specific T-cell antigen receptors (TCRs) binding to antigenic peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) molecules on other cells(1). If productive, these interactions promote the formation of an immunological synapse(2,3). Here we show that synaptic TCR-pMHC binding dynamics differ significantly from TCR-pMHC binding in solution. We used single-molecule microscopy and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between fluorescently tagged TCRs and their cognate pMHC ligands to measure the kinetics of TCR-pMHC binding in situ. When compared with solution measurements, the dissociation of this complex was increased significantly (4-12-fold). Disruption of actin polymers reversed this effect, indicating that cytoskeletal dynamics destabilize this interaction directly or indirectly. Nevertheless, TCR affinity for pMHC was significantly elevated as the result of a large (about 100-fold) increase in the association rate, a likely consequence of complementary molecular orientation and clustering. In helper T cells, the CD4 molecule has been proposed to bind cooperatively with the TCR to the same pMHC complex. However, CD4 blockade had no effect on the synaptic TCR affinity, nor did it destabilize TCR-pMHC complexes, indicating that the TCR binds pMHC independently of CD4.","[Huppa, Johannes B.; Moertelmaier, Manuel A.; Lillemeier, Bjoern F.; Newell, Evan W.; Klein, Lawrence O.; Davis, Mark M.] Stanford Univ, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Stanford Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Davis, Mark M.] Beckman Ctr B221, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Axmann, Markus; Moertelmaier, Manuel A.; Brameshuber, Mario; Schuetz, Gerhard J.] Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Inst Biophys, A-4040 Linz, Austria","Davis, MM (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Stanford Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",mmdavis@stanford.edu,"Schutz, Gerhard/B-1243-2008; Newell, Evan/F-9711-2012","Schutz, Gerhard/0000-0003-1542-1089; Newell, Evan/0000-0002-2889-243X; Brameshuber, Mario/0000-0001-8672-2255",National Institutes of Health [RO1 AI52211]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Frontier Research Center (iFREC); Wilhelm Macke Stiftung; American Cancer Society; National Science Foundation; Austrian Science Fund [Y250-B10]; Austrian Ministry for Science and Research,"We thank F.

380,J,"Liu, XD; Yang, PS; Yang, WJ; Yue, DT",,,,"Liu, Xiaodong; Yang, Philemon S.; Yang, Wanjun; Yue, David T.",,,Enzyme-inhibitor-like tuning of Ca2+ channel connectivity with calmodulin,NATURE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,CA2+-DEPENDENT INACTIVATION; CALCIUM-CHANNELS; DOMAIN; MECHANISMS; PROTEINS; CELLS; MICE,"Ca2+ channels and calmodulin (CaM) are two prominent signalling hubs(1) that synergistically affect functions as diverse as cardiac excitability(2), synaptic plasticity(3) and gene transcription(4). It is therefore fitting that these hubs are in some sense coordinated, as the opening of Ca(V)1-2 Ca2+ channels are regulated by a single CaM constitutively complexed with channels(5). The Ca2+-free form of CaM (apoCaM) is already pre-associated with the isoleucine-glutamine (IQ) domain on the channel carboxy terminus, and subsequent Ca2+ binding to this 'resident' CaM drives conformational changes that then trigger regulation of channel opening(6). Another potential avenue for channel-CaM coordination could arise from the absence of Ca2+ regulation in channels lacking a pre-associated CaM6,7. Natural fluctuations in CaM concentrations might then influence the fraction of regulable channels and, thereby, the overall strength of Ca2+ feedback. However, the prevailing view has been that the ultrastrong affinity of channels for apoCaM ensures their saturation with CaM8, yielding a significant form of concentration independence between Ca2+ channels and CaM. Here we show that significant exceptions to this autonomy exist, by combining electrophysiology (to characterize channel regulation) with optical fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) sensor determination of free-apoCaM concentration in live cells(9). This approach translates quantitative CaM biochemistry from the traditional test-tube context into the realm of functioning holochannels within intact cells. From this perspective, we find that long splice forms of Ca(V)1.3 and Ca(V)1.4 channels include a distal carboxy tail(10-12) that resembles an enzyme competitive inhibitor that retunes channel affinity for apoCaM such that natural CaM variations affect the strength of Ca2+ feedback modulation. Given the ubiquity of these channels(13,14), the connection between ambient CaM levels and Ca2+ entry through channels is broadly significant for Ca2+ homeostasis. Strategies such as ours promise key advances for the in situ analysis of signalling molecules resistant to in vitro reconstitution, such as Ca2+ channels.","[Liu, Xiaodong; Yang, Philemon S.; Yang, Wanjun; Yue, David T.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biomed Engn, Calcium Signals Lab, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Liu, Xiaodong; Yang, Philemon S.; Yang, Wanjun; Yue, David T.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Yue, DT (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biomed Engn, Calcium Signals Lab, Ross Bldg,Room 713,720 Rutland Ave, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",dyue@jhmi.edu,"Liu, Xiaodong/B-1839-2008","Liu, Xiaodong/0000-0002-3171-9611","US National Institute of Mental Health; US National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; US National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke","We thank M.

The implications of climate change for the environment and society will depend not only on the response of the Earth system to changes in radiative forcings, but also on how humankind responds through changes in technology, economies, lifestyle and policy. Extensive uncertainties exist in future forcings of and responses to climate change, necessitating the use of scenarios of the future to explore the potential consequences of different response options. To date, such scenarios have not adequately examined crucial possibilities, such as climate change mitigation and adaptation, and have relied on research processes that slowed the exchange of information among physical, biological and social scientists. Here we describe a new process for creating plausible scenarios to investigate some of the most challenging and important questions about climate change confronting the global community.","[Moss, Richard H.; Edmonds, Jae A.; Smith, Steven J.; Thomson, Allison M.] Univ Maryland, Pacific NW Natl Lab, Joint Global Change Res Inst, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Hibbard, Kathy A.; Meehl, Gerald A.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Climate & Global Dynam Div, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; [Manning, Martin R.] Victoria Univ Wellington, New Zealand Climate Change Res Inst, Wellington, New Zealand; [Rose, Steven K.] Elect Power Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [van Vuuren, Detlef P.; Kram, Tom] Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy, NL-3720 AH Bilthoven, Netherlands; [Carter, Timothy R.] Finnish Environm Inst, Helsinki 00251, Finland; [Emori, Seita; Kainuma, Mikiko] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan; [Mitchell, John F.

Obtained from similar to 4,000-year-old permafrost-preserved hair, the genome represents a male individual from the first known culture to settle in Greenland. Sequenced to an average depth of 20X, we recover 79% of the diploid genome, an amount close to the practical limit of current sequencing technologies. We identify 353,151 high-confidence single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), of which 6.8% have not been reported previously. We estimate raw read contamination to be no higher than 0.8%. We use functional SNP assessment to assign possible phenotypic characteristics of the individual that belonged to a culture whose location has yielded only trace human remains. We compare the high-confidence SNPs to those of contemporary populations to find the populations most closely related to the individual. This provides evidence for a migration from Siberia into the New World some 5,500 years ago, independent of that giving rise to the modern Native Americans and Inuit.","[Rasmussen, Morten; Lindgreen, Stinus; Gilbert, M.

Here we describe the genome sequence of the wild grass Brachypodium distachyon (Brachypodium), which is, to our knowledge, the first member of the Pooideae subfamily to be sequenced. Comparison of the Brachypodium, rice and sorghum genomes shows a precise history of genome evolution across a broad diversity of the grasses, and establishes a template for analysis of the large genomes of economically important pooid grasses such as wheat. The high-quality genome sequence, coupled with ease of cultivation and transformation, small size and rapid life cycle, will help Brachypodium reach its potential as an important model system for developing new energy and food crops.","[Vogel, John P.; Huo, Naxin; Gu, Yong Q; Lazo, Gerard R.; Anderson, Olin D.; Bragg, Jennifer N.; Laudencia-Chingcuanco, Debbie; Belknap, William; Tyler, Ludmila; Wu, Jiajie; Thomson, James] USDA ARS, Western Reg Res Ctr, Albany, CA 94710 USA; [Garvin, David F.] USDA ARS, Plant Sci Res Unit, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Garvin, David F.] Univ Minnesota, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Mockler, Todd C.; Fox, Samuel E.; Priest, Henry D.; Filichkin, Sergei A.; Givan, Scott A.; Bryant, Douglas W.; Chang, Jeff H.; Fahlgren, Noah; Sullivan, Christopher M.; Carrington, James C.; Chapman, Elisabeth J.; Kimbrel, Jeffrey A.] Oregon State Univ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Schmutz, Jeremy; Grimwood, Jane] HudsonAlpha Inst, Huntsville, AL 35806 USA; [Rokhsar, Dan; Barry, Kerrie; Lucas, Susan; Harmon-Smoth, Miranda; Lail, Kathleen; Tice, Hope; Febrer, Melanie; Lindquist, Erika; Wang, Mei] US DOE, Joint Genome Inst, Walnut Creek, CA 94598 USA; [Rokhsar, Dan; Mitros, Therese; Tyler, Ludmila] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Bevan, Michael W.; McKenzie, Neil; Wright, Jan; Byrne, Mary E.; Walsh, Sean; Higgins, Janet] John Innes Ctr, Norwich NR4 7UJ, Norfolk, England; [You, Frank M.; Luo, Ming-Cheng; Dvorak, Jan; Wu, Jiajie; Bartley, Laura E.; Cao, Peijian; Jung, Ki-Hong; Sharma, Manoj K.; Vega-Sanchez, Miguel; Ronald, Pamela] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Idziak, Dominika; Hasterok, Robert] Univ Silesia, Katowice, Poland; [Wu, Haiyan; Wu, Wei; Hsia, An-Ping; Schnable, Patrick S.] Iowa State Univ, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Kalyanaraman, Anantharaman] Washington State Univ, Pullman, WA 99163 USA; [Baarbazuk, Brad] Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Michael, Todd P.; Bruggmann, Remy; Messing, Joachim] Rutgers State Univ, Piscataway, NJ 08855 USA; [Hazen, Samuel P.; Chen, Shan] Univ Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Weng, Yiqun] Univ Wisconsin, USDA ARS, Vegetable Crops Res Unit, Dept Hort, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Haberer, Georg; Spannagl, Mianuel; Mayer, Klaus; Gundlach, Heidrun] Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany; [Rattei, Thomas] Tech Univ Munich, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Lee, Sang-Jik; Rose, Jocelyn K.

Addictive drugs increase the levels of dopamine and also trigger long-lasting synaptic adaptations in the mesolimbic reward system that ultimately may induce the pathological behaviour. The neural basis for the addictive nature of benzodiazepines, however, remains elusive. Here we show that benzodiazepines increase firing of dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area through the positive modulation of GABA(A) (gamma-aminobutyric acid type A) receptors in nearby interneurons. Such disinhibition, which relies on alpha 1-containing GABA(A) receptors expressed in these cells, triggers drug-evoked synaptic plasticity in excitatory afferents onto dopamine neurons and underlies drug reinforcement. Taken together, our data provide evidence that benzodiazepines share defining pharmacological features of addictive drugs through cell-type-specific expression of alpha 1-containing GABA(A) receptors in the ventral tegmental area. The data also indicate that subunit-selective benzodiazepines sparing alpha 1 may be devoid of addiction liability.","[Tan, Kelly R.; Brown, Matthew; Labouebe, Gwenael; Yvon, Cedric; Creton, Cyril; Luescher, Christian] Univ Geneva, Dept Basic Neurosci, Fac Med, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Fritschy, Jean-Marc] Univ Zurich, Inst Pharmacol & Toxicol, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Rudolph, Uwe] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Lab Genet Neuropharmacol, McLean Hosp, Belmont, MA 02478 USA; [Rudolph, Uwe] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Belmont, MA 02478 USA; [Luescher, Christian] Univ Hosp Geneva, Dept Clin Neurosci, Neurol Clin, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Luescher, Christian] Geneva Neurosci Ctr, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland","Luscher, C (reprint author), Univ Geneva, Dept Basic Neurosci, Fac Med, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland.",christian.luscher@unige.ch,"Luscher, Christian/A-2496-2011","Luscher, Christian/0000-0001-7917-4596; Brown, Matthew/0000-0001-6983-962X",National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) [DA019022]; Swiss National Science Foundation; Swiss Initiative in Systems Biology; European Commission [LSHM-CT-2005-19063],"We thank members of the Luscher laboratory as well as M.

During embryonic development, the transcription factor neurogenin 3 (Neurog3) initiates the differentiation of the beta-cells and other islet cell types from pancreatic endoderm, but the genetic program that subsequently completes this differentiation remains incompletely understood. Here we show that the transcription factor Rfx6 directs islet cell differentiation downstream of Neurog3. Mice lacking Rfx6 failed to generate any of the normal islet cell types except for pancreatic-polypeptide-producing cells. In human infants with a similar autosomal recessive syndrome of neonatal diabetes, genetic mapping and subsequent sequencing identified mutations in the human RFX6 gene. These studies demonstrate a unique position for Rfx6 in the hierarchy of factors that coordinate pancreatic islet development in both mice and humans. Rfx6 could prove useful in efforts to generate beta-cells for patients with diabetes.","[Qu, Hui-Qi; Taleb, Nadine; Lu, Yang; Grabs, Rosemary; Mitchell, John; Polychronakos, Constantin] McGill Univ, Dept Paediat, Montreal, PQ H3H 1P3, Canada; [Qu, Hui-Qi; Taleb, Nadine; Lu, Yang; Grabs, Rosemary; Mitchell, John; Polychronakos, Constantin] McGill Univ, Dept Human Genet, Montreal, PQ H3H 1P3, Canada; [Smith, Stuart B.; Kishimoto, Nina Y.; Scheel, David W.; Wang, Juehu; Lynn, Francis C.; Miyatsuka, Takeshi; Seerke, Rina; German, Michael S.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Ctr Diabet, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Patch, Ann-Marie; Hattersley, Andrew T.] Peninsula Med Sch, Inst Biomed & Clin Sci, Exeter EX2 5DW, Devon, England; [Desir, Julie; Eijnden, Serge Vanden; Abramowicz, Marc] ULB, Hop Erasme, Dept Neonatol, B-1070 Brussels, Belgium; [Hansen, Inger] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Kacet, Nadine; Weill, Jacques; Renard, Marie-Eve] Hop Calmette, Dept Neonatol, F-59037 Lille, France; [Gentile, Mattia] Di Venere Gen Hosp, Med Genet Unit, I-70012 Bari, Italy; [Dewar, Ken] McGill Univ, Dept Human Genet, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada; [Dewar, Ken] McGill Univ, Ctr Hlth, Res Inst, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada; [Wang, Rennian] Univ Western Ontario, Child Hlth Res Inst, Dept Physiol, London, ON N6C 2V5, Canada; [Wang, Rennian] Univ Western Ontario, Child Hlth Res Inst, Dept Med & Pharmacol, London, ON N6C 2V5, Canada; [Wilson, Maria E.; Johnson, Jeffrey D.] Metabolex Inc, Hayward, CA 94545 USA; [German, Michael S.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Med, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Polychronakos, C (reprint author), McGill Univ, Dept Paediat, Montreal, PQ H3H 1P3, Canada.",constantin.polychronakos@mcgill.ca; mgerman@diabetes.ucsf.edu,"Qu, Hui-Qi/B-4719-2009; Patch, Ann-Marie/F-8060-2011; Wang, Rennian/N-3879-2015","Qu, Hui-Qi/0000-0001-9317-4488; Polychronakos, Constantin/0000-0002-7624-6635; Mitchell, John/0000-0002-6055-6858; ",Larry L.

As this is relatively rare in the local Universe, galaxies like the Milky Way form only a few new stars per year. Typical massive galaxies in the distant Universe formed stars an order of magnitude more rapidly(1,2). Unless star formation was significantly more efficient, this difference suggests that young galaxies were much more molecular-gas rich. Molecular gas observations in the distant Universe have so far largely been restricted to very luminous, rare objects, including mergers and quasars(3-5), and accordingly we do not yet have a clear idea about the gas content of more normal (albeit massive) galaxies. Here we report the results of a survey of molecular gas in samples of typical massive-star-forming galaxies at mean redshifts, < z > of about 1.2 and 2.3, when the Universe was respectively 40% and 24% of its current age. Our measurements reveal that distant star forming galaxies were indeed gas rich, and that the star formation efficiency is not strongly dependent on cosmic epoch. The average fraction of cold gas relative to total galaxy baryonic mass at z = 2.3 and z = 1.2 is respectively about 44% and 34%, three to ten times higher than in today's massive spiral galaxies(6). The slow decrease between z approximate to 2 and z approximate to 1 probably requires a mechanism of semi-continuous replenishment of fresh gas to the young galaxies.","[Tacconi, L.

The difference between the mass of an atom and the sum of its building blocks (the binding energy) is a manifestation of Einstein's famous relation E = mc(2). The binding energy determines the energy available for nuclear reactions and decays (and thus the creation of elements by stellar nucleosynthesis), and holds the key to the fundamental question of how heavy the elements can be. Superheavy elements have been observed in challenging production experiments(2-4), but our present knowledge of the binding energy of these nuclides is based only on the detection of their decay products. The reconstruction from extended decay chains introduces uncertainties that render the interpretation difficult. Here we report direct mass measurements of transuranium nuclides. Located at the farthest tip of the actinide species on the proton number-neutron number diagram, these nuclides represent the gateway to the predicted island of stability. In particular, we have determined the mass values of (252-254)No (atomic number 102) with the Penning trap mass spectrometer SHIPTRAP(5). The uncertainties are of the order of 10 keV/c(2) (representing a relative precision of 0.05 p.p.m.), despite minute production rates of less than one atom per second. Our experiments advance direct mass measurements by ten atomic numbers with no loss in accuracy, and provide reliable anchor points en route to the island of stability.","[Block, M.; Ackermann, D.; Dworschak, M.; Herfurth, F.; Hessberger, F.

Topological switching of pi-conjugation in organic molecules, such as the keto-enol transformation, has long been anticipated as a means of realizing these phenomena in molecular assemblies and crystals(1). Croconic acid, an ingredient of black dyes(2), was recently found to have a hydrogen-bonded polar structure in a crystalline state(3). Here we demonstrate that application of an electric field can coherently align the molecular polarities in crystalline croconic acid, as indicated by an increase of optical second harmonic generation, and produce a well-defined polarization hysteresis at room temperature. To make this simple pentagonal molecule ferroelectric, we switched the pi-bond topology using synchronized proton transfer instead of rigid-body rotation. Of the organic ferroelectrics, this molecular crystal exhibits the highest spontaneous polarization (similar to 20 mu C cm(-2)) in spite of its small molecular size, which is in accord with first-principles electronic-structure calculations. Such high polarization, which persists up to 400 K, may find application in active capacitor and nonlinear optics elements in future organic electronics.","[Horiuchi, Sachio; Kumai, Reiji; Tokura, Yoshinori] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058562, Japan; [Tokunaga, Yusuke; Itoh, Hirotake; Shimano, Ryo; Tokura, Yoshinori] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, ERATO, Multiferro Project, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Giovannetti, Gianluca; Picozzi, Silvia] CNR, INFM, CASTI Reg Lab, I-67100 Laquila, Italy; [Shimano, Ryo] Univ Tokyo, Dept Phys, Tokyo 1138656, Japan; [Giovannetti, Gianluca] Leiden Univ, Inst Lorenz Theoret Phys, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands; [Tokura, Yoshinori] Univ Tokyo, Dept Appl Phys, Tokyo 1138656, Japan","Horiuchi, S (reprint author), Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058562, Japan.",s-horiuchi@aist.go.jp; tokura@ap.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Tokura, Yoshinori/C-7352-2009; Picozzi, Silvia/E-2374-2011; Horiuchi, Sachio/R-2377-2017; Kumai, Reiji/R-2453-2017; SPIN-CNR, L'Aquila/C-7274-2011; Tokunaga, Yusuke/B-3008-2013; Giovannetti, Gianluca/L-4339-2013","Picozzi, Silvia/0000-0002-3232-788X; Horiuchi, Sachio/0000-0002-7720-4605; Kumai, Reiji/0000-0002-5320-0028; ","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan [20110003]; European Research Council under the European Community [203523]","S.

Well-known examples are those in the atmospheres of giant planets and the alternating jet streams found in the Earth's world ocean(1). Zonal flow formation in nuclear fusion devices is also well studied(2). A common feature of these zonal flows is that they are spontaneously generated in turbulent systems. Because the Earth's outer core is believed to be in a turbulent state, it is possible that there is zonal flow in the liquid iron of the outer core. Here we report an investigation at the current low-viscosity limit of numerical simulations of the geodynamo. We find a previously unknown convection regime of the outer core that has a dual structure comprising inner, sheet-like radial plumes and an outer, westward cylindrical zonal flow. We numerically confirm that the dual-convection structure with such a zonal flow is stable under a strong, self-generated dipole magnetic field.","[Kageyama, Akira] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan; [Miyagoshi, Takehiro] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan; [Sato, Tetsuya] Univ Hyogo, Kobe, Hyogo 6500044, Japan","Kageyama, A (reprint author), Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan.",kage@cs.kobe-u.ac.jp,"Kageyama, Akira/H-4537-2013","Kageyama, Akira/0000-0003-0433-668X",KAKENHI [17540404]; Mitsubishi Foundation,This work was supported by KAKENHI (17540404) and The Mitsubishi Foundation.,,26,36,36,0,19,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-Feb,2010,463,7282,,,,,793,U102,,10.1038/nature08754,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,553VG,WOS:000274394300036,20148036.0,No,,,11/20/17,tetsuya,sato,male,1,16,bpM4ZKkAAAAJ,456

Fossil chordates from this interval offer crucial insights into how the distinctive body plan of vertebrates evolved, but reading this pre-biomineralization fossil record is fraught with difficulties, leading to controversial and contradictory interpretations(3,4). The cause of these difficulties is taphonomic: we lack data on when and how important characters change as they decompose, resulting in a lack of constraint on anatomical interpretation and a failure to distinguish phylogenetic absence of characters from loss through decay(3). Here we show, from experimental decay of amphioxus and ammocoetes, that loss of chordate characters during decay is non-random: the more phylogenetically informative are the most labile, whereas plesiomorphic characters are decay resistant. The taphonomic loss of synapomorphies and relatively higher preservation potential of chordate plesiomorphies will thus result in bias towards wrongly placing fossils on the chordate stem. Application of these data to Cathaymyrus (Cambrian period of China) and Metaspriggina (Cambrian period of Canada) highlights the difficulties: these fossils cannot be placed reliably in the chordate or vertebrate stem because they could represent the decayed remains of any non-biomineralized, total-group chordate. Preliminary data suggest that this decay filter also affects other groups of organisms and that 'stem-ward slippage' may be a widespread but currently unrecognized bias in our understanding of the early evolution of a number of phyla.","[Sansom, Robert S.; Gabbott, Sarah E.; Purnell, Mark A.] Univ Leicester, Dept Geol, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England","Purnell, MA (reprint author), Univ Leicester, Dept Geol, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",mark.purnell@le.ac.uk,"Sansom, Robert/H-1902-2012; Purnell, Mark/A-2336-2010","Purnell, Mark/0000-0002-1777-9220; Sansom, Robert/0000-0003-1926-2556",UK Natural Environment Research Council [NE/E015336/1],"This work was funded by UK Natural Environment Research Council grant NE/E015336/1.

By forming cooperative groups, sperm can increase their swimming velocity and thereby gain an advantage in intermale sperm competition(1,2). Accordingly, selection should favour cooperation of the most closely related sperm to maximize fitness(3). Here we show that sperm of deer mice (genus Peromyscus) form motile aggregations, then we use this system to test predictions of sperm cooperation. We find that sperm aggregate more often with conspecific than heterospecific sperm, suggesting that individual sperm can discriminate on the basis of genetic relatedness. Next, we provide evidence that the cooperative behaviour of closely related sperm is driven by sperm competition. In a monogamous species lacking sperm competition, Peromyscus polionotus, sperm indiscriminately group with unrelated conspecific sperm. In contrast, in the highly promiscuous deer mouse, Peromyscus maniculatus, sperm are significantly more likely to aggregate with those obtained from the same male than with sperm from an unrelated conspecific donor. Even when we test sperm from sibling males, we continue to see preferential aggregations of related sperm in P. maniculatus. These results suggest that sperm from promiscuous deer mice discriminate among relatives and thereby cooperate with the most closely related sperm, an adaptation likely to have been driven by sperm competition.","[Fisher, Heidi S.; Hoekstra, Hopi E.] Harvard Univ, Museum Comparat Zool, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Fisher, Heidi S.; Hoekstra, Hopi E.] Harvard Univ, Ctr Brain Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Fisher, HS (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Museum Comparat Zool, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",hfisher@oeb.harvard.edu,"Hoekstra, Hopi/I-6690-2012","Hoekstra, Hopi/0000-0003-1431-1769; Fisher, Heidi/0000-0001-5622-4335",NIH; Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation,"We thank M.

Recently it was discovered that the light-dependent magnetic sense of Drosophila melanogaster is mediated by the ultraviolet (UV)-A/blue light photoreceptor cryptochrome (Cry)(1). Here we show, using a transgenic approach, that the photoreceptive, Drosophila-like type 1 Cry and the transcriptionally repressive, vertebrate-like type 2 Cry of the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) can both function in the magnetoreception system of Drosophila and require UV-A/blue light (wavelength below 420 nm) to do so. The lack of magnetic responses for both Cry types at wavelengths above 420 nm does not fit the widely held view that tryptophan triad-generated radical pairs mediate the ability of Cry to sense a magnetic field. We bolster this assessment by using a mutant form of Drosophila and monarch type 1 Cry and confirm that the tryptophan triad pathway is not crucial in magnetic transduction. Together, these results suggest that animal Crys mediate light-dependent magnetoreception through an unconventional photochemical mechanism. This work emphasizes the utility of Drosophila transgenesis for elucidating the precise mechanisms of Cry-mediated magnetosensitivity in insects and also in vertebrates such as migrating birds.","[Gegear, Robert J.; Foley, Lauren E.; Casselman, Amy; Reppert, Steven M.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Worcester, MA 01605 USA","Reppert, SM (reprint author), Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, 364 Plantat St, Worcester, MA 01605 USA.",robert.gegear@umassmed.edu; steven.reppert@umassmed.edu,,,National Institutes of Health,"We thank Q.

The T(reg) cell subset is comprised of cells that commit to the T(reg) lineage by upregulating the transcription factor Foxp3 either in the thymus (tT(reg)) or in the periphery (iT(reg))(1,2). Considering a central role for Foxp3 in T(reg) cell differentiation and function(3,4), we proposed that conserved non-coding DNA sequence (CNS) elements at the Foxp3 locus encode information defining the size, composition and stability of the T(reg) cell population. Here we describe the function of three Foxp3 CNS elements (CNS1-3) in T(reg) cell fate determination in mice. The pioneer element CNS3, which acts to potently increase the frequency of T(reg) cells generated in the thymus and the periphery, binds c-Rel in in vitro assays. In contrast, CNS1, which contains a TGF-beta-NFAT response element, is superfluous for tT(reg) cell differentiation, but has a prominent role in iT(reg) cell generation in gut-associated lymphoid tissues. CNS2, although dispensable for Foxp3 induction, is required for Foxp3 expression in the progeny of dividing T(reg) cells. Foxp3 binds to CNS2 in a Cbf-beta-Runx1 and CpG DNA demethylation-dependent manner, suggesting that Foxp3 recruitment to this 'cellular memory module' facilitates the heritable maintenance of the active state of the Foxp3 locus and, therefore, T(reg) lineage stability. Together, our studies demonstrate that the composition, size and maintenance of the T(reg) cell population are controlled by Foxp3 CNS elements engaged in response to distinct cell-extrinsic or -intrinsic cues.","[Zheng, Ye; Josefowicz, Steven; Chaudhry, Ashutosh; Forbush, Katherine; Rudensky, Alexander Y.] Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Zheng, Ye; Josefowicz, Steven; Chaudhry, Ashutosh; Forbush, Katherine; Rudensky, Alexander Y.] Univ Washington, Dept Immunol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Zheng, Ye; Josefowicz, Steven; Chaudhry, Ashutosh; Peng, Xiao P.; Rudensky, Alexander Y.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Zheng, Ye; Josefowicz, Steven; Chaudhry, Ashutosh; Peng, Xiao P.; Rudensky, Alexander Y.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Program Immunol, New York, NY 10065 USA","Rudensky, AY (reprint author), Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",rudenska@mskcc.org,"Josefowicz, Steven/B-8716-2011; Zheng, Ye/G-4866-2015","Zheng, Ye/0000-0001-5012-4309; josefowicz, steven/0000-0001-7453-779X; Chaudhry, Ashutosh/0000-0003-3379-5236",National Institutes of Health; CRI-Irvington Institute; CRI,"We thank T.-T.

Knowledge of these host cell requirements not only informs us of the molecular pathways exploited by the virus but also provides further targets that could be pursued for antiviral drug development. Here we use an integrative systems approach, based on genome-wide RNA interference screening, to identify 295 cellular cofactors required for early-stage influenza virus replication. Within this group, those involved in kinase-regulated signalling, ubiquitination and phosphatase activity are the most highly enriched, and 181 factors assemble into a highly significant host-pathogen interaction network. Moreover, 219 of the 295 factors were confirmed to be required for efficient wild-type influenza virus growth, and further analysis of a subset of genes showed 23 factors necessary for viral entry, including members of the vacuolar ATPase (vATPase) and COPI-protein families, fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) proteins, and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3)-beta. Furthermore, 10 proteins were confirmed to be involved in post-entry steps of influenza virus replication. These include nuclear import components, proteases, and the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM kinase) II beta (CAMK2B). Notably, growth of swine-origin H1N1 influenza virus is also dependent on the identified host factors, and we show that small molecule inhibitors of several factors, including vATPase and CAMK2B, antagonize influenza virus replication.","[Koenig, Renate; Inoue, Atsushi; De Jesus, Paul; Pache, Lars; Shih, Crystal; Chanda, Sumit K.] Burnham Inst Med Res, Infect & Inflammatory Dis Ctr, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Bhattacharyya, Suchita; Young, John A.

High mutation rates facilitate the generation of viral escape mutants, rendering vaccines and drugs directed against virus-encoded targets potentially ineffective(2). In contrast, targeting host cell determinants temporarily dispensable for the host but crucial for virus replication could prevent viral escape. Here we report the discovery of 287 human host cell genes influencing influenza A virus replication in a genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screen. Using an independent assay we confirmed 168 hits (59%) inhibiting either the endemic H1N1 (119 hits) or the current pandemic swine-origin (121 hits) influenza A virus strains, with an overlap of 60%. Notably, a subset of these common hits was also essential for replication of a highly pathogenic avian H5N1 strain. In-depth analyses of several factors provided insights into their infection stage relevance. Notably, SON DNA binding protein (SON)(3) was found to be important for normal trafficking of influenza virions to late endosomes early in infection. We also show that a small molecule inhibitor of CDC-like kinase 1 (CLK1)(4) reduces influenza virus replication by more than two orders of magnitude, an effect connected with impaired splicing of the viral M2 messenger RNA. Furthermore, influenza-virus-infected p27(-/-) (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B; Cdkn1b) mice accumulated significantly lower viral titres in the lung, providing in vivo evidence for the importance of this gene. Thus, our results highlight the potency of genome-wide RNAi screening for the dissection of virus-host interactions and the identification of drug targets for a broad range of influenza viruses.","[Karlas, Alexander; Machuy, Nikolaus; Shin, Yujin; Artarini, Anita; Heuer, Dagmar; Becker, Daniel; Khalil, Hany; Ogilvie, Lesley A.; Hess, Simone; Maeurer, Andre P.; Mueller, Elke; Rudel, Thomas; Meyer, Thomas F.] Max Planck Inst Infect Biol, Dept Mol Biol, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Pleissner, Klaus-Peter] Max Planck Inst Infect Biol, Core Facil Bioinformat, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Wolff, Thorsten] Robert Koch Inst, D-13353 Berlin, Germany","Meyer, TF (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Infect Biol, Dept Mol Biol, Charitepl 1, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",meyer@mpiib-berlin.mpg.de,"Meyer, Thomas F./J-2485-2013; Khalil, Hany /J-7700-2017","Meyer, Thomas F./0000-0002-6120-8679; Khalil, Hany /0000-0001-9738-4087",EU [LSHB-CT-2004-005276]; ERA-Net Pathogenomics [0313938A]; FCI; RiNA network Berlin; German Government support via BMG; German Government support via BMBF,"The authors would like to thank M.

Semaphorins are one of the largest families of these instructive cues and are widely studied for their effects on cell movement, navigation, angiogenesis, immunology and cancer(1). Semaphorins/collapsins were characterized in part on the basis of their ability to drastically alter actin cytoskeletal dynamics in neuronal processes(2), but despite considerable progress in the identification of semaphorin receptors and their signalling pathways(3), the molecules linking them to the precise control of cytoskeletal elements remain unknown. Recently, highly unusual proteins of the Mical family of enzymes have been found to associate with the cytoplasmic portion of plexins, which are large cell-surface semaphorin receptors, and to mediate axon guidance, synaptogenesis, dendritic pruning and other cell morphological changes(4-7). Mical enzymes perform reduction-oxidation (redox) enzymatic reactions(4,5,8-10) and also contain domains found in proteins that regulate cell morphology(4,11). However, nothing is known of the role of Mical or its redox activity in mediating morphological changes. Here we report that Mical directly links semaphorins and their plexin receptors to the precise control of actin filament (F-actin) dynamics. We found that Mical is both necessary and sufficient for semaphorin-plexin-mediated F-actin reorganization in vivo. Likewise, we purified Mical protein and found that it directly binds F-actin and disassembles both individual and bundled actin filaments. We also found that Mical utilizes its redox activity to alter F-actin dynamics in vivo and in vitro, indicating a previously unknown role for specific redox signalling events in actin cytoskeletal regulation. Mical therefore is a novel F-actin-disassembly factor that provides a molecular conduit through which actin reorganization-a hallmark of cell morphological changes including axon navigation-can be precisely achieved spatiotemporally in response to semaphorins.","[Hung, Ruei-Jiun; Yazdani, Umar; Yoon, Jimok; Wu, Heng; Yang, Taehong; Gupta, Nidhi; Huang, Zhiyu; Terman, Jonathan R.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Neurosci, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Hung, Ruei-Jiun; Yazdani, Umar; Yoon, Jimok; Wu, Heng; Yang, Taehong; Gupta, Nidhi; Huang, Zhiyu; Terman, Jonathan R.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Pharmacol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Hung, Ruei-Jiun; Yazdani, Umar; Yoon, Jimok; Wu, Heng; Yang, Taehong; Gupta, Nidhi; Huang, Zhiyu; Terman, Jonathan R.] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Grad Program Neurosci, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [van Berkel, Willem J.

AdiC is a representative member of the amino acid-polyamine-organocation (APC) superfamily of membrane transporters(4,5). The structure of substrate-free AdiC revealed a homodimeric assembly, with each protomer containing 12 transmembrane segments and existing in an outward-open conformation(6,7). The overall folding of AdiC is similar to that of the Na(+)-coupled symporters(8-11). Despite these advances, it remains unclear how the substrate (arginine or agmatine) is recognized and transported by AdiC. Here we report the crystal structure of an E. coli AdiC variant bound to Arg at 3.0 angstrom resolution. The positively charged Arg is enclosed in an acidic binding chamber, with the head groups of Arg hydrogen-bonded to main chain atoms of AdiC and the aliphatic portion of Arg stacked by hydrophobic side chains of highly conserved residues. Arg binding induces pronounced structural rearrangement in transmembrane helix 6 (TM6) and, to a lesser extent, TM2 and TM10, resulting in an occluded conformation. Structural analysis identified three potential gates, involving four aromatic residues and Glu 208, which may work in concert to differentially regulate the upload and release of Arg and Agm.","[Gao, Xiang; Zeng, Xin; Shi, Yigong] Tsinghua Univ, Minist Educ, Prot Sci Lab, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Lijun; Jiao, Xuyao; Lu, Feiran; Yan, Chuangye; Wang, Jiawei] Tsinghua Univ, State Key Lab Biomembrane & Membrane Biotechnol, Struct Biol Ctr, Sch Life Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Lijun; Jiao, Xuyao; Lu, Feiran; Yan, Chuangye; Wang, Jiawei] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Med, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Jiao, Xuyao] Shandong Univ, Sch Life Sci, Jinan 250100, Shandong, Peoples R China","Shi, YG (reprint author), Tsinghua Univ, Minist Educ, Prot Sci Lab, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",shi-lab@tsinghua.edu.cn,,"Zhou, Lijun/0000-0002-0393-4787",Ministry of Science and Technology [2009CB918801]; Tsinghua University; National Natural Science Foundation; Beijing Municipal Commissions of Education and Science and Technology,"We thank C.

In the absence of DGCR8 (Dgcr8(-/-)), a protein required for microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis, mouse ESCs are unable to silence self-renewal. Here we show that the introduction of let-7 miRNAs-a family of miRNAs highly expressed in somatic cells-can suppress self-renewal in Dgcr8(-/-) but not wild-type ESCs. Introduction of ESC cell cycle regulating (ESCC) miRNAs into the Dgcr8(-/-) ESCs blocks the capacity of let-7 to suppress self-renewal. Profiling and bioinformatic analyses show that let-7 inhibits whereas ESCC miRNAs indirectly activate numerous self-renewal genes. Furthermore, inhibition of the let-7 family promotes de-differentiation of somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells. Together, these findings show how the ESCC and let-7 miRNAs act through common pathways to alternatively stabilize the self-renewing versus differentiated cell fates.","[Melton, Collin; Judson, Robert L.; Blelloch, Robert] Univ Calif San Francisco, Eli & Edythe Broad Ctr Regenerat Med & Stem Cell, Program Biomed Sci, Ctr Reprod Sci, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Melton, Collin; Judson, Robert L.; Blelloch, Robert] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Urol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Blelloch, R (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Eli & Edythe Broad Ctr Regenerat Med & Stem Cell, Program Biomed Sci, Ctr Reprod Sci, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",blellochr@stemcell.ucsf.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health (NIH) [K08 NS48118, R01 NS057221]; California Institute of Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) [RS1-00161, RN2-00906]; American Health Assistance Foundation; Pew Charitable Trust; National Science Foundation (NSF)","We would like to thank M.

To survive and evade host responses the parasite remodels the erythrocyte by exporting several hundred effector proteins beyond the surrounding parasitophorous vacuole membrane. A feature of exported proteins is a pentameric motif (RxLxE/Q/D) that is a substrate for an unknown protease. Here we show that the protein responsible for cleavage of this motif is plasmepsin V (PMV), an aspartic acid protease located in the endoplasmic reticulum. PMV cleavage reveals the export signal (xE/Q/D) at the amino terminus of cargo proteins. Expression of an identical mature protein with xQ at the N terminus generated by signal peptidase was not exported, demonstrating that PMV activity is essential and linked with other key export events.

Proteins destined for export are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and cleaved at a conserved (PEXEL) motif, which allows translocation into the host cell via an ATP-driven translocon called the PTEX complex. We report that plasmepsin V, an ER aspartic protease with distant homology to the mammalian processing enzyme BACE, recognizes the PEXEL motif and cleaves it at the correct site.

Here we report ground-based observations of the dayside emission spectrum for HD189733b between 2.0-2.4 mu m and 3.1-4.1 mu m, where we find a bright emission feature. Where overlap with space-based instruments exists, our results are in excellent agreement with previous measurements(2,6). A feature at similar to 3.25 mu m is unexpected and difficult to explain with models that assume local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) conditions at the 1 bar to 1 x 10(-6) bar pressures typically sampled by infrared measurements. The most likely explanation for this feature is that it arises fromnon-LTE emission from CH(4), similar to what is seen in the atmospheres of planets in our own Solar System(7-9). These results suggest that non-LTE effects may need to be considered when interpreting measurements of strongly irradiated exoplanets.","[Swain, Mark R.; Deroo, Pieter; Vasisht, Gautam; Chen, Pin] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA; [Griffith, Caitlin A.] Univ Arizona, Lunar & Planetary Lab, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Tinetti, Giovanna] UCL, Dept Phys & Astron, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Crossfield, Ian J.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Astron, Los Angeles, CA 90034 USA; [Thatte, Azam] Georgia Inst Technol, George W Woodruff Sch Mech Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Bouwman, Jeroen; Afonso, Cristina; Henning, Thomas] Max Planck Inst Astron, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Angerhausen, Daniel] German SOFIA Inst, Inst Space Syst, Stuttgart, Germany","Swain, MR (reprint author), CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, 4800 Oak Grove Dr, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA.",mark.r.swain@jpl.nasa.gov,"Chen, Pin/B-1112-2008","Chen, Pin/0000-0003-1195-9666; Tinetti, Giovanna/0000-0001-6058-6654",UK Sciences and Technology Facilities Council; European Space Agency; National Aeronautics and Space Administration,"We thank S.

An intriguing example is provided by desert beetles, which use micrometre-sized patterns of hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions on their backs to capture water from humid air(6). As anyone who has admired spider webs adorned with dew drops will appreciate, spider silk is also capable of efficiently collecting water from air. Here we show that the water-collecting ability of the capture silk of the cribellate spider Uloborus walckenaerius is the result of a unique fibre structure that forms after wetting, with the 'wet-rebuilt' fibres characterized by periodic spindle-knots made of random nanofibrils and separated by joints made of aligned nanofibrils. These structural features result in a surface energy gradient between the spindle-knots and the joints and also in a difference in Laplace pressure, with both factors acting together to achieve continuous condensation and directional collection of water drops around spindle-knots. Submillimetre-sized liquid drops have been driven by surface energy gradients(7-9) or a difference in Laplace pressure(10), but until now neither force on its own has been used to overcome the larger hysteresis effects that make the movement of micrometre-sized drops more difficult. By tapping into both driving forces, spider silk achieves this task. Inspired by this finding, we designed artificial fibres that mimic the structural features of silk and exhibit its directional water-collecting ability.","[Huang, Zhongbing; Tian, Xuelin; Nie, Fu-Qiang; Zhao, Yong; Jiang, Lei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Chem, BNLMS, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Yongmei; Zhai, Jin] Beijing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Sch Chem & Environm, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Bai, Hao] Natl Ctr Nanosci & Technol, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China","Jiang, L (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Chem, BNLMS, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.",zhaoyong@iccas.ac.cn; jianglei@iccas.ac.cn,"jiang, lei/E-8437-2010; Zhao, Yong/D-4523-2009; Jiang, Lei/B-1066-2011; Tian, Xuelin/C-3424-2008; Bai, Hao/J-5255-2012; Bai, Hao/D-1713-2017","Tian, Xuelin/0000-0001-6178-2067; Bai, Hao/0000-0002-1707-4976; Bai, Hao/0000-0002-3348-6129",State Basic Research Program of China [2007CB936403]; Key Program in the National Natural Science Foundation of China [119030601101]; Knowledge Innovation Program in the Chinese Academy of Sciences [2A200522222200301],"We thank the State Basic Research Program of China (2007CB936403), the Key Program in the National Natural Science Foundation of China (119030601101), and the Knowledge Innovation Program in the Chinese Academy of Sciences (2A200522222200301).",,27,517,552,124,1040,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,4-Feb,2010,463,7281,,,,,640,643,,10.1038/nature08729,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,551GB,WOS:000274193900031,20130646.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,lei,jiang,female,0.56,54,na,na

Crucial components for the photosynthetic process are antenna proteins, which absorb light and transmit the resultant excitation energy between molecules to a reaction centre. The efficiency of these electronic energy transfers has inspired much work on antenna proteins isolated from photosynthetic organisms to uncover the basic mechanisms at play(1-5). Intriguingly, recent work has documented(6-8) that light-absorbing molecules in some photosynthetic proteins capture and transfer energy according to quantum-mechanical probability laws instead of classical laws(9) at temperatures up to 180 K. This contrasts with the long-held view that long-range quantum coherence between molecules cannot be sustained in complex biological systems, even at low temperatures. Here we present two-dimensional photon echo spectroscopy(10-13) measurements on two evolutionarily related light-harvesting proteins isolated from marine cryptophyte algae, which reveal exceptionally long-lasting excitation oscillations with distinct correlations and anti-correlations even at ambient temperature. These observations provide compelling evidence for quantum-coherent sharing of electronic excitation across the 5-nm-wide proteins under biologically relevant conditions, suggesting that distant molecules within the photosynthetic proteins are 'wired' together by quantum coherence for more efficient light-harvesting in cryptophyte marine algae.","[Collini, Elisabetta; Wong, Cathy Y.; Brumer, Paul; Scholes, Gregory D.] Univ Toronto, Dept Chem, Inst Opt Sci, Toronto, ON M5S 3H6, Canada; [Collini, Elisabetta; Wong, Cathy Y.; Brumer, Paul; Scholes, Gregory D.] Univ Toronto, Ctr Quantum Informat & Quantum Control, Toronto, ON M5S 3H6, Canada; [Wilk, Krystyna E.; Curmi, Paul M.

Tectonic 'non-volcanic' tremor, a recently discovered seismic signal(1) probably generated by shear slip on the deep extension of some major faults(2-4), can provide new insight into the deep fate of such faults, including that of the San Andreas fault near Parkfield, California(5). Here I examine continuous seismic data from mid-2001 to 2008, identifying tremor and decomposing the signal into different families of activity based on the shape and timing of the waveforms at multiple stations(6). This approach allows differentiation between activities from nearby patches of the deep fault and begins to unveil rich and complex patterns of tremor occurrence. I find that tremor exhibits nearly continuous migration, with the most extensive episodes propagating more than 20 kilometres along fault strike at rates of 15-80 kilometres per hour. This suggests that the San Andreas fault remains a localized through-going structure, at least to the base of the crust, in this area. Tremor rates and recurrence behaviour changed markedly in the wake of the 2004 magnitude-6.0 Parkfield earthquake(6,7), but these changes were far from uniform within the tremor zone, probably reflecting heterogeneous fault properties and static and dynamic stresses decaying away from the rupture. The systematic recurrence of tremor demonstrated here suggests the potential to monitor detailed time-varying deformation on this portion of the deep San Andreas fault, deformation which unsteadily loads the shallower zone that last ruptured in the 1857 magnitude-7.9 Fort Tejon earthquake(8).","US Geol Survey, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA","Shelly, DR (reprint author), US Geol Survey, 345 Middlefield Rd,MS 977, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA.",dshelly@usgs.gov,,,,,,30,85,87,0,15,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-Feb,2010,463,7281,,,,,648,U75,,10.1038/nature08755,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,551GB,WOS:000274193900033,20130648.0,No,,,11/20/17,david r.,shelly,male,1,1,na,na

To explain its unique, imbalanced biological diversity, G. G. Simpson proposed the 'sweepstakes hypothesis', according to which the ancestors of Madagascar's present-day mammal stock rafted there from Africa(2). This is an important hypothesis in biogeography and evolutionary theory for how animals colonize new frontiers(1,3-5), but its validity is questioned(5-9). Studies suggest that currents were inconsistent with rafting to Madagascar(9) and that land bridges provided the migrants' passage(5-8). Here we show that currents could have transported the animals to the island and highlight evidence inconsistent with the land-bridge hypothesis. Using palaeogeographic reconstructions and palaeo-oceanographic modelling, we find that strong surface currents flowed from northeast Mozambique and Tanzania eastward towards Madagascar during the Palaeogene period, exactly as required by the 'sweepstakes process'. Subsequently, Madagascar advanced north towards the equatorial gyre and the regional current system evolved into its modern configuration with flows westward(10) from Madagascar to Africa. This may explain why no fully non-aquatic land mammals have colonized Madagascar since the arrival of the rodents and carnivorans during the early-Miocene epoch. One implication is that rafting may be the dominant means of overseas dispersal in the Cenozoic era when palaeocurrent directions are properly considered.","[Huber, Matthew] Purdue Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Huber, Matthew] Purdue Univ, Purdue Climate Change Res Ctr, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Ali, Jason R.] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Earth Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Huber, M (reprint author), Purdue Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",huberm@purdue.edu,"Ali, Jason/A-2738-2010; Huber, Matthew/A-7677-2008","Huber, Matthew/0000-0002-2771-9977; Ali, Jason Richard/0000-0002-5214-620X",US National Science Foundation (NSF) [0927946-ATM],"M.

However, the existence of grid cells in humans and their distribution throughout the brain are unknown. Here we show that the preferred firing directions of directionally modulated grid cells in rat entorhinal cortex are aligned with the grids, and that the spatial organization of grid-cell firing is more strongly apparent at faster than slower running speeds. Because the grids are also aligned with each other(1,5), we predicted a macroscopic signal visible to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans. We then looked for this signal as participants explored a virtual reality environment, mimicking the rats' foraging task: fMRI activation and adaptation showing a speed-modulated six-fold rotational symmetry in running direction. The signal was found in a network of entorhinal/subicular, posterior and medial parietal, lateral temporal and medial prefrontal areas. The effect was strongest in right entorhinal cortex, and the coherence of the directional signal across entorhinal cortex correlated with spatial memory performance. Our study illustrates the potential power of combining single-unit electrophysiology with fMRI in systems neuroscience. Our results provide evidence for grid-cell-like representations in humans, and implicate a specific type of neural representation in a network of regions which supports spatial cognition and also autobiographical memory.","[Doeller, Christian F.; Barry, Caswell; Burgess, Neil] UCL Inst Cognit Neurosci, London WC1N 3AR, England; [Doeller, Christian F.; Burgess, Neil] UCL Inst Neurol, London WC1N 3BG, England; [Barry, Caswell] UCL, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Barry, Caswell] UCL, Inst Behav Neurosci, London WC1H 0AP, England","Doeller, CF (reprint author), UCL Inst Cognit Neurosci, London WC1N 3AR, England.",c.doeller@ucl.ac.uk; n.burgess@ucl.ac.uk,"Burgess, Neil/B-2420-2009; Doeller, Christian/E-6376-2012","Burgess, Neil/0000-0003-0646-6584; ",UK Medical Research Council; European Union,"We acknowledge K.

Severe perturbations, which overcome such buffering mechanisms, produce altered phenotypes that can be heritable and can themselves be canalized by a genetic assimilation process. An important implication of this concept is that the buffering mechanism could be genetically controlled. Recent studies on Hsp90, a protein involved in several cellular processes and development pathways(2-5), indicate that it is a possible molecular mechanism for canalization and genetic assimilation. In both flies and plants, mutations in the Hsp90-encoding gene induce a wide range of phenotypic abnormalities, which have been interpreted as an increased sensitivity of different developmental pathways to hidden genetic variability(6,7.) Thus, Hsp90 chaperone machinery may be an evolutionarily conserved buffering mechanism of phenotypic variance, which provides the genetic material for natural selection. Here we offer an additional, perhaps alternative, explanation for proposals of a concrete mechanism underlying canalization. We show that, in Drosophila, functional alterations of Hsp90 affect the Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA; a class of germ-line-specific small RNAs) silencing mechanism leading to transposon activation and the induction of morphological mutants. This indicates that Hsp90 mutations can generate new variation by transposon-mediated 'canonical' mutagenesis.","[Specchia, Valeria; Bozzetti, Maria P.] Univ Salento, DiSTeBA, I-73100 Lecce, Italy; [Piacentini, Lucia; Fanti, Laura; Pimpinelli, Sergio] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Ist Pasteur, Fdn Cenci Bolognetti, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Piacentini, Lucia; Fanti, Laura; Pimpinelli, Sergio] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Genet & Biol Mol, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Tritto, Patrizia; D'Alessandro, Rosalba; Palumbo, Gioacchino] Univ Bari, DIGEMI, I-70126 Bari, Italy","Bozzetti, MP (reprint author), Univ Salento, DiSTeBA, I-73100 Lecce, Italy.",maria.bozzetti@unisalento.it,"Bozzetti, Maria/C-4694-2013","Specchia, Valeria/0000-0002-1051-6014",Ministero dell'Universita e della Ricerca (MIUR),"This study was supported by a grant from the Ministero dell'Universita e della Ricerca (MIUR) project: RNAi, heterochromatin and epigenetic control of gene expression and chromosome behaviour.

Large (>500 kilobases), rare (<1%) deletions were significantly enriched in patients compared to 7,366 controls (P<0.001). We identified several rare copy number variants that were recurrent in patients but absent or at much lower prevalence in controls. We identified five patients with overlapping deletions on chromosome 16p11.2 that were found in 2 out of 7,366 controls (P<5 x 10(-5)). In three patients the deletion co-segregated with severe obesity. Two patients harboured a larger de novo 16p11.2 deletion, extending through a 593-kilobase region previously associated with autism(2-4) and mental retardation(5); both of these patients had mild developmental delay in addition to severe obesity. In an independent sample of 1,062 patients with severe obesity alone, the smaller 16p11.2 deletion was found in an additional two patients. All 16p11.2 deletions encompass several genes but include SH2B1, which is known to be involved in leptin and insulin signalling(6). Deletion carriers exhibited hyperphagia and severe insulin resistance disproportionate for the degree of obesity. We show that copy number variation contributes significantly to the genetic architecture of human obesity.","[Bochukova, Elena G.; Keogh, Julia; Henning, Elana; Purmann, Carolin; Blaszczyk, Kasia; Saeed, Sadia; O'Rahilly, Stephen; Farooqi, I.

Recent extensive genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with obesity, but these loci together account for only a small fraction of the known heritable component(1). Thus, the 'common disease, common variant' hypothesis is increasingly coming under challenge(2). Here we report a highly penetrant form of obesity, initially observed in 31 subjects who were heterozygous for deletions of at least 593 kilobases at 16p11.2 and whose ascertainment included cognitive deficits. Nineteen similar deletions were identified from GWAS data in 16,053 individuals from eight European cohorts. These deletions were absent from healthy non-obese controls and accounted for 0.7% of our morbid obesity cases (body mass index (BMI) >= 40 kg m(-2) or BMI standard deviation score >= 4; P = 6.43 x 10(-8), odds ratio 43.0), demonstrating the potential importance in common disease of rare variants with strong effects. This highlights a promising strategy for identifying missing heritability in obesity and other complex traits: cohorts with extreme phenotypes are likely to be enriched for rare variants, thereby improving power for their discovery. Subsequent analysis of the loci so identified may well reveal additional rare variants that further contribute to the missing heritability, as recently reported for SIM1 (ref. 3). The most productive approach may therefore be to combine the 'power of the extreme'(4) in small, well-phenotyped cohorts, with targeted follow-up in case-control and population cohorts.","[Walters, R.

It is widely believed that BCR-ABL activates Akt signalling that suppresses the forkhead O transcription factors (FOXO), supporting the proliferation or inhibiting the apoptosis of CML cells(2-4). Although the use of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib is a breakthrough for CML therapy, imatinib does not deplete the leukaemia-initiating cells (LICs) that drive the recurrence of CML(5-8). Here, using a syngeneic transplantation system and a CML-like myeloproliferative disease mouse model, we show that Foxo3a has an essential role in the maintenance of CML LICs. We find that cells with nuclear localization of Foxo3a and decreased Akt phosphorylation are enriched in the LIC population. Serial transplantation of LICs generated from Foxo3a(+/+) and Foxo3a(-/-) mice shows that the ability of LICs to cause disease is significantly decreased by Foxo3a deficiency. Furthermore, we find that TGF-beta is a critical regulator of Akt activation in LICs and controls Foxo3a localization. A combination of TGF-beta inhibition, Foxo3a deficiency and imatinib treatment led to efficient depletion of CML in vivo. Furthermore, the treatment of human CML LICs with a TGF-beta inhibitor impaired their colony-forming ability in vitro. Our results demonstrate a critical role for the TGF-beta-FOXO pathway in the maintenance of LICs, and strengthen our understanding of the mechanisms that specifically maintain CML LICs in vivo.","[Naka, Kazuhito; Hoshii, Takayuki; Muraguchi, Teruyuki; Tadokoro, Yuko; Ooshio, Takako; Hirao, Atsushi] Kanazawa Univ, Div Mol Genet, Ctr Canc & Stem Cell Res, Canc Res Inst, Kanazawa, Ishikawa 9200934, Japan; [Ooshio, Takako; Hirao, Atsushi] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, CREST, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1020075, Japan; [Kondo, Yukio; Nakao, Shinji] Kanazawa Univ, Grad Sch Med Sci, Div Canc Med, Kanazawa, Ishikawa 9208641, Japan; [Motoyama, Noboru] Natl Ctr Gerontol & Geriatr, Natl Inst Longev Sci, Dept Geriatr Med, Aichi 4748522, Japan","Naka, K (reprint author), Kanazawa Univ, Div Mol Genet, Ctr Canc & Stem Cell Res, Canc Res Inst, Kanazawa, Ishikawa 9200934, Japan.",kazunaka@kenroku.kanazawa-u.ac.jp; ahirao@kenroku.kanazawa-u.ac.jp,,,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan [17GS0419]","We thank H.

However, the enormous complexity of folding landscapes of large macromolecules raises the question of whether there is in fact a unique global minimum corresponding to a unique native conformation or whether there are deep local minima corresponding to alternative active conformations(3). The folding of many proteins is well described by two-state models, leading to highly simplified representations of protein folding landscapes with a single native conformation(4,5). Nevertheless, accumulating experimental evidence suggests a more complex topology of folding landscapes with multiple active conformations that can take seconds or longer to interconvert(6-8). Here we demonstrate, using single-molecule experiments, that an RNA enzyme folds into multiple distinct native states that interconvert on a timescale much longer than that of catalysis. These data demonstrate that severe ruggedness of RNA folding landscapes extends into conformational space occupied by native conformations.","[Solomatin, Sergey V.; Herschlag, Daniel] Stanford Univ, Dept Biochem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Greenfeld, Max] Stanford Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Chu, Steven] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Chu, Steven] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys & Mol & Cell Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Herschlag, D (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Biochem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",herschla@stanford.edu,,,"US National Institutes of Health (NIH) [P01-GM-66275, GM49243]; Stanford Bio-X Program","We thank T.

The primary sequence of a protein defines its free-energy landscape and thus determines the folding pathway and the rate constants of folding and unfolding, as well as the protein's native structure. Theory has shown that roughness in the energy landscape will lead to slower folding(1), but derivation of detailed experimental descriptions of this landscape is challenging. Simple folding models(2,3) show that folding is significantly influenced by chain entropy; proteins in which the contacts are local fold quickly, owing to the low entropy cost of forming stabilizing, native contacts during folding(4,5). For some protein families, stability is also a determinant of folding rate constants(6). Where these simple metrics fail to predict folding behaviour, it is probable that there are features in the energy landscape that are unusual. Such general observations cannot explain the folding behaviour of the R15, R16 and R17 domains of alpha-spectrin. R15 folds similar to 3,000 times faster than its homologues, although they have similar structures, stabilities and, as far as can be determined, transition-state stabilities(7-10). Here we show that landscape roughness (internal friction) is responsible for the slower folding and unfolding of R16 and R17. We use chimaeric domains to demonstrate that this internal friction is a property of the core, and suggest that frustration in the landscape of the slow-folding spectrin domains may be due to misdocking of the long helices during folding. Theoretical studies have suggested that rugged landscapes will result in slower folding; here we show experimentally that such a phenomenon directly influences the folding kinetics of a 'normal' protein, that is, one with a significant energy barrier that folds on a relatively slow, millisecond-second, timescale.","[Wensley, Beth G.; Batey, Sarah; Bone, Fleur A.

Resistance to these drugs has compromised their effectiveness against many influenza strains, including pandemic H1N1. A recent crystal structure of M2(22-46) showed electron densities attributed to a single amantadine in the amino-terminal half of the pore(2), indicating a physical occlusion mechanism for inhibition. However, a solution NMR structure of M2(18-60) showed four rimantadines bound to the carboxy-terminal lipid-facing surface of the helices(3), suggesting an allosteric mechanism. Here we show by solid-state NMR spectroscopy that two amantadine-binding sites exist in M2 in phospholipid bilayers. The high-affinity site, occupied by a single amantadine, is located in the N-terminal channel lumen, surrounded by residues mutated in amantadine-resistant viruses. Quantification of the protein-amantadine distances resulted in a 0.3 angstrom-resolution structure of the high-affinity binding site. The second, low-affinity, site was observed on the C-terminal protein surface, but only when the drug reaches high concentrations in the bilayer. The orientation and dynamics of the drug are distinct in the two sites, as shown by (2)H NMR. These results indicate that amantadine physically occludes the M2 channel, thus paving the way for developing new antiviral drugs against influenza viruses. The study demonstrates the ability of solid-state NMR to elucidate small-molecule interactions with membrane proteins and determine high-resolution structures of their complexes.","[Cady, Sarah D.; Schmidt-Rohr, Klaus; Hong, Mei] Iowa State Univ, Dept Chem, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Wang, Jun; Soto, Cinque S.; DeGrado, William F.] Univ Penn, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Wang, Jun; Soto, Cinque S.; DeGrado, William F.] Univ Penn, Dept Chem, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Hong, M (reprint author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Chem, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",mhong@iastate.edu,"Wang, Jun/G-6504-2010","Wang, Jun/0000-0002-4845-4621; Cady, Sarah/0000-0002-8310-7422","NSF [MCB-0543473]; NIH [GM088204, GM56423, AI74571]; Iowa State University Foundation","This work was supported by a NSF grant MCB-0543473 and an NIH grant GM088204 to M.

Although defects in tissue-resident stem cells clearly contribute to these phenotypes, it is unclear to what extent they reflect stem cell intrinsic alterations or age-related changes in the stem cell supportive microenvironment, or niche. Here, using complementary in vivo and in vitro heterochronic models, we show that age-associated changes in stem cell supportive niche cells deregulate normal haematopoiesis by causing haematopoietic stem cell dysfunction. Furthermore, we find that age-dependent defects in niche cells are systemically regulated and can be reversed by exposure to a young circulation or by neutralization of the conserved longevity regulator, insulin-like growth factor-1, in the marrow microenvironment. Together, these results show a new and critical role for local and systemic factors in signalling age-related haematopoietic decline, and highlight a new model in which blood-borne factors in aged animals act through local niche cells to induce age-dependent disruption of stem cell function.","[Mayack, Shane R.; Shadrach, Jennifer L.; Kim, Francis S.; Wagers, Amy J.] Harvard Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Stem Cell & Regenerat Biol, Harvard Stem Cell Inst,Joslin Diabet Ctr, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Wagers, AJ (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Stem Cell & Regenerat Biol, Harvard Stem Cell Inst,Joslin Diabet Ctr, 1 Joslin Pl, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",amy.wagers@joslin.harvard.edu,,,"Burroughs-Welcome Fund; WM Keck Foundation; Glenn Foundation; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [1 DP2 OD004345-01, T32DK07260-29]; Iacocca Foundation; Joslin Diabetes Center DERC [P30DK036836]","This work was supported in part by funding from the Burroughs-Welcome Fund, WM Keck Foundation, Glenn Foundation, and National Institutes of Health (NIH) 1 DP2 OD004345-01 (to A.

They are distinguished by the production of an energetic and collimated relativistic outflow powered(2) by a central engine (an accreting black hole or neutron star). Observationally, this outflow is manifested(3) in the pulse of gamma-rays and a long-lived radio afterglow. Until now, central-engine driven supernovae have been discovered exclusively through their gamma-ray emission, yet it is expected(4) that a larger population goes undetected because of limited satellite sensitivity or beaming of the collimated emission away from our line of sight. In this framework, the recovery of undetected GRBs may be possible through radio searches(5,6) for type Ibc supernovae with relativistic outflows. Here we report the discovery of luminous radio emission from the seemingly ordinary type Ibc SN 2009bb, which requires a substantial relativistic outflow powered by a central engine. A comparison with our radio survey of type Ibc supernovae reveals that the fraction harbouring central engines is low, about one per cent, measured independently from, but consistent with, the inferred(7) rate of nearby GRBs.

Although both phenomena originate from the core collapse of a massive star, supernovae emit mostly at optical wavelengths, whereas GRBs emit mostly in soft gamma-rays or hard X-rays. Though the GRB central engine generates ultra-relativistic jets, which beam the early emission into a narrow cone, no relativistic outflows have hitherto been found in type Ib/c supernovae explosions, despite theoretical expectations(5-7) and searches(8). Here we report radio (interferometric) observations that reveal a mildly relativistic expansion in a nearby type Ic supernova, SN 2007gr. Using two observational epochs 60 days apart, we detect expansion of the source and establish a conservative lower limit for the average apparent expansion velocity of 0.6c. Independently, a second mildly relativistic supernova has been reported(9). Contrary to the radio data, optical observations(10-13) of SN 2007gr indicate a typical type Ic supernova with ejecta velocities similar to 6,000 km s(-1), much lower than in GRB-associated supernovae. We conclude that in SN 2007gr a small fraction of the ejecta produced a low-energy mildly relativistic bipolar radio jet, while the bulk of the ejecta were slower and, as shown by optical spectropolarimetry(14), mildly aspherical.","[Paragi, Z.; Pidopryhora, Y.; van Langevelde, H.

A fundamental question is what symmetries are broken when the pseudogap phase sets in, which occurs when the temperature decreases below a value T*. There is evidence from measurements of both polarized neutron diffraction(2,3) and the polar Kerr effect(4) that time-reversal symmetry is broken, but at temperatures that differ significantly from one another. Broken rotational symmetry was detected from both resistivity measurements(5) and inelastic neutron scattering(6-8) at low doping, and from scanning tunnelling spectroscopy(9,10) at low temperature, but showed no clear relation to T*. Here we report the observation of a large in-plane anisotropy of the Nernst effect in YBa2Cu3Oy that sets in precisely at T* throughout the doping phase diagram. We show that the CuO chains of the orthorhombic lattice are not responsible for this anisotropy, which is therefore an intrinsic property of the CuO2 planes. We conclude that the pseudogap phase is an electronic state that strongly breaks four-fold rotational symmetry. This narrows the range of possible states considerably, pointing to stripe or nematic order(11,12).","[Daou, R.; Chang, J.; LeBoeuf, David; Cyr-Choiniere, Olivier; Laliberte, Francis; Doiron-Leyraud, Nicolas; Taillefer, Louis] Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Phys, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada; [Daou, R.; Chang, J.; LeBoeuf, David; Cyr-Choiniere, Olivier; Laliberte, Francis; Doiron-Leyraud, Nicolas; Taillefer, Louis] Univ Sherbrooke, RQMP, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada; [Ramshaw, B.

But while there are many examples for the oxidative addition of C-H bonds to a metal centre, transformations that feature oxidative addition of C-C bonds are rare. The paucity of transformations that involve the cleavage of C-C rather than C-H bonds is usually attributed to kinetic factors arising from the greater steric hindrance and the directional nature of the sp(n) hybrids that form the C-C bond, and to thermodynamic factors arising from the fact that M-C bonds are weaker than M-H bonds(2-5). Not surprisingly, therefore, most examples of C-C bond cleavage either avoid the kinetic limitations by using metal compounds in which the C-C bond is held in close proximity to the metal centre, or avoid the thermodynamic limitations by using organic substrates in which the cleavage is accompanied by either a relief of strain energy or the formation of an aromatic system(2-5). Here, we show that a tungsten centre can be used to cleave a strong C-C bond that is a component of an unstrained 6-membered aromatic ring. The cleavage is enabled by the formation of an unusual chelating di(isocyanide) ligand, which suggests that other metal centres with suitable ancillary ligands could also accomplish the cleavage of strong C-C bonds of aromatic substrates and thereby provide new ways of functionalizing such molecules.","[Sattler, Aaron; Parkin, Gerard] Columbia Univ, Dept Chem, New York, NY 10027 USA","Parkin, G (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Dept Chem, New York, NY 10027 USA.",parkin@columbia.edu,,,"US Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-FG02-93ER14339]; National Science Foundation [CHE-0619638]","We thank the US Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences (DE-FG02-93ER14339) for supporting this research.

Owing to this feedback, at time-scales ranging from interannual to the 20-100-kyr cycles of Earth's orbital variations(1,5-7), warming of the climate system causes a net release of CO2 into the atmosphere; this in turn amplifies warming. But the magnitude of the climate sensitivity of the global carbon cycle (termed gamma), and thus of its positive feedback strength, is under debate, giving rise to large uncertainties in global warming projections(8,9). Here we quantify the median gamma as 7.7 p. p. m. v. CO2 per degrees C warming, with a likely range of 1.7-21.4 p. p. m. v. CO2 per degrees C. Sensitivity experiments exclude significant influence of pre-industrial land-use change on these estimates. Our results, based on the coupling of a probabilistic approach with an ensemble of proxy-based temperature reconstructions and pre-industrial CO2 data from three ice cores, provide robust constraints for gamma on the policy-relevant multi-decadal to centennial timescales. By using an ensemble of >200,000 members, quantification of gamma is not only improved, but also likelihoods can be assigned, thereby providing a benchmark for future model simulations. Although uncertainties do not at present allow exclusion of gamma calculated from any of ten coupled carbon-climate models, we find that gamma is about twice as likely to fall in the lowermost than in the uppermost quartile of their range. Our results are incompatibly lower (P < 0.05) than recent pre-industrial empirical estimates of similar to 40 p. p. m. v. CO2 per degrees C (refs 6, 7), and correspondingly suggest similar to 80% less potential amplification of ongoing global warming.","[Frank, David C.; Buentgen, Ulf; Trouet, Valerie] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Frank, David C.; Raible, Christoph C.; Stocker, Benjamin; Joos, Fortunat] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Esper, Jan] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Geog, D-55099 Mainz, Germany; [Raible, Christoph C.; Stocker, Benjamin; Joos, Fortunat] Univ Bern, Inst Phys, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland","Frank, DC (reprint author), Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Zurcherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland.",david.frank@wsl.ch,"Frank, David/C-7764-2013; buentgen, ulf/J-6952-2013; Raible, Christoph/M-8309-2016; Stocker, Benjamin/K-3194-2015","Raible, Christoph/0000-0003-0176-0602; Stocker, Benjamin/0000-0003-2697-9096; Joos, Fortunat/0000-0002-9483-6030","Swiss National Science Foundation (NCCR-Climate); European Union [226701, 017008]","We thank P.

For most of human evolutionary history, runners were either barefoot or wore minimal footwear such as sandals or moccasins with smaller heels and little cushioning relative to modern running shoes. We wondered how runners coped with the impact caused by the foot colliding with the ground before the invention of the modern shoe. Here we show that habitually barefoot endurance runners often land on the fore-foot (fore-foot strike) before bringing down the heel, but they sometimes land with a flat foot (mid-foot strike) or, less often, on the heel (rear-foot strike). In contrast, habitually shod runners mostly rear-foot strike, facilitated by the elevated and cushioned heel of the modern running shoe. Kinematic and kinetic analyses show that even on hard surfaces, barefoot runners who fore-foot strike generate smaller collision forces than shod rear-foot strikers. This difference results primarily from a more plantarflexed foot at landing and more ankle compliance during impact, decreasing the effective mass of the body that collides with the ground. Fore-foot-and mid-foot-strike gaits were probably more common when humans ran barefoot or in minimal shoes, and may protect the feet and lower limbs from some of the impact-related injuries now experienced by a high percentage of runners.","[Lieberman, Daniel E.; Venkadesan, Madhusudhan; Daoud, Adam I.] Harvard Univ, Dept Human Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Venkadesan, Madhusudhan] Harvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Werbel, William A.] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [D'Andrea, Susan] Providence Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Ctr Restorat & Regenerat Med, Providence, RI 02906 USA; [Davis, Irene S.] Univ Delaware, Dept Phys Therapy, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Mang'Eni, Robert Ojiambo; Pitsiladis, Yannis] Moi Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med Physiol, Eldoret 30100, Kenya; [Mang'Eni, Robert Ojiambo; Pitsiladis, Yannis] Univ Glasgow, Fac Biomed Life Sci, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland","Lieberman, DE (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Human Evolutionary Biol, 11 Divin Ave, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",danlieb@fas.harvard.edu,"Henrich, Joseph/A-2403-2009; Venkadesan, Madhusudhan/B-4697-2008","Venkadesan, Madhusudhan/0000-0001-5754-7478",US National Science Foundation; American School of Prehistoric Research; Goelet Fund; Harvard University; Vibram USA,"We are grateful to the many volunteer runners who donated their time and patience.

Little is known about the recent evolution of the Y chromosome because only the human Y chromosome has been fully sequenced. Prevailing theories hold that Y chromosomes evolve by gene loss, the pace of which slows over time, eventually leading to a paucity of genes, and stasis(3,4). These theories have been buttressed by partial sequence data from newly emergent plant and animal Y chromosomes(5-8), but they have not been tested in older, highly evolved Y chromosomes such as that of humans. Here we finished sequencing of the male-specific region of the Y chromosome (MSY) in our closest living relative, the chimpanzee, achieving levels of accuracy and completion previously reached for the human MSY. By comparing the MSYs of the two species we show that they differ radically in sequence structure and gene content, indicating rapid evolution during the past 6 million years. The chimpanzee MSY contains twice as many massive palindromes as the human MSY, yet it has lost large fractions of the MSY protein-coding genes and gene families present in the last common ancestor. We suggest that the extraordinary divergence of the chimpanzee and human MSYs was driven by four synergistic factors: the prominent role of the MSY in sperm production, 'genetic hitchhiking' effects in the absence of meiotic crossing over, frequent ectopic recombination within the MSY, and species differences in mating behaviour. Although genetic decay may be the principal dynamic in the evolution of newly emergent Y chromosomes, wholesale renovation is the paramount theme in the continuing evolution of chimpanzee, human and perhaps other older MSYs.","[Hughes, Jennifer F.; Skaletsky, Helen; Pyntikova, Tatyana; Rozen, Steve; Page, David C.] Whitehead Inst, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Hughes, Jennifer F.; Skaletsky, Helen; Pyntikova, Tatyana; Rozen, Steve; Page, David C.] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Graves, Tina A.; Minx, Patrick J.; Fulton, Robert S.; McGrath, Sean D.; Locke, Devin P.; Mardis, Elaine R.; Warren, Wesley C.; Wilson, Richard K.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Genome Ctr, St Louis, MO 63108 USA; [van Daalen, Saskia K.

Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes that, unlike T and B lymphocytes, do not express antigen receptors but rapidly exhibit cytotoxic activities against virus-infected cells and produce various cytokines(1,2). Here we report a new type of innate lymphocyte present in a novel lymphoid structure associated with adipose tissues in the peritoneal cavity. These cells do not express lineage (Lin) markers but do express c-Kit, Sca-1 (also known as Ly6a), IL7R and IL33R. Similar lymphoid clusters were found in both human and mouse mesentery and we term this tissue 'FALC' (fat-associated lymphoid cluster). FALC Lin(-)c-Kit(+)Sca-1(+) cells are distinct from lymphoid progenitors(3) and lymphoid tissue inducer cells(4). These cells proliferate in response to IL2 and produce large amounts of T(H)2 cytokines such as IL5, IL6 and IL13. IL5 and IL6 regulate B-cell antibody production and self-renewal of B1 cells(5-7). Indeed, FALC Lin(-)c-Kit(+)Sca-1(+) cells support the self-renewal of B1 cells and enhance IgA production. IL5 and IL13 mediate allergic inflammation and protection against helminth infection(8,9). After helminth infection and in response to IL33, FALC Lin(-)c-Kit(+)Sca-1(+) cells produce large amounts of IL13, which leads to goblet cell hyperplasia-a critical step for helminth expulsion. In mice devoid of FALC Lin(-)c-Kit(+)Sca-1(+) cells, such goblet cell hyperplasia was not induced. Thus, FALC Lin(-)c-Kit(+)Sca-1(+) cells are T(H)2-type innate lymphocytes, and we propose that these cells be called 'natural helper cells'.","[Moro, Kazuyo; Furusawa, Jun-ichi; Ohtani, Masashi; Fujii, Hideki; Koyasu, Shigeo] Keio Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Shinjuku Ku, Tokyo 1608582, Japan; [Yamada, Taketo] Keio Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Shinjuku Ku, Tokyo 1608582, Japan; [Tanabe, Masanobu; Takeuchi, Tsutomu] Keio Univ, Sch Med, Dept Trop Med & Parasitol, Shinjuku Ku, Tokyo 1608582, Japan; [Moro, Kazuyo] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, CREST, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1020075, Japan; [Ikawa, Tomokatsu; Kawamoto, Hiroshi] Riken Res Ctr Allergy & Immunol, Lab Lymphocyte Dev, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Ohtani, Masashi] Kansai Med Univ, Inst Biomed Sci, Dept Cell Signalling, Osaka 5708506, Japan; [Koyasu, Shigeo] Japan Soc Promot Sci, Res Ctr Sci Syst, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1028472, Japan","Koyasu, S (reprint author), Keio Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Shinjuku Ku, Tokyo 1608582, Japan.",koyasu@sc.itc.keio.ac.jp,"Moro, Kazuyo/A-5987-2016; Koyasu, Shigeo/J-5583-2015","Koyasu, Shigeo/0000-0001-9585-3038","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [20790378, 14370116, 16390146, 18390155]; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan","We thank Y.

Complex cell interactions in the tumour and its microenvironment are thought to have an important role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression(2). Furthermore, cooperation between oncogenic genetic lesions is required for tumour development(3); however, it is not known how cell interactions contribute to oncogenic cooperation. The genetic techniques available in the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster allow analysis of the behaviour of cells with distinct mutations(4), making this the ideal model organism with which to study cell interactions and oncogenic cooperation. In Drosophila eye-antennal discs, cooperation between the oncogenic protein Ras(V12) (ref.5) and loss-of-function mutations in the conserved tumour suppressor scribbled (scrib)(6,7) gives rise to metastatic tumours that display many characteristics observed in human cancers(8-11). Here we show that clones of cells bearing different mutations can cooperate to promote tumour growth and invasion in Drosophila. We found that the Ras(V12) and scrib(-) mutations can also cause tumours when they affect different adjacent epithelial cells. We show that this interaction between Ras(V12) and scrib(-) clones involves JNK signalling propagation and JNK-induced upregulation of JAK/STAT-activating cytokines, a compensatory growth mechanism for tissue homeostasis. The development of Ras(V12) tumours can also be triggered by tissue damage, a stress condition that activates JNK signalling. Given the conservation of the pathways examined here, similar cooperative mechanisms could have a role in the development of human cancers.","[Wu, Ming; Pastor-Pareja, Jose Carlos; Xu, Tian] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New Haven, CT 06519 USA; [Xu, Tian] Fudan Univ, Sch Life Sci, Inst Dev Biol & Mol Med, Fudan Yale Biomed Res Ctr, Shanghai 20043, Peoples R China","Xu, T (reprint author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Howard Hughes Med Inst, 295 Congress Ave, New Haven, CT 06519 USA.",tian.xu@yale.edu,,"Pastor-Pareja, Jose Carlos/0000-0002-3823-4473",Spanish Ministry of Education; NIH/NCI,"We thank E.

Clues to its molecular mechanism of action may lay in the recently reported stress-and cancer-associated translocation of a small portion of Hsp70 to the lysosomal compartment(1,11). Here we show that Hsp70 stabilizes lysosomes by binding to an endolysosomal anionic phospholipid bis(monoacylglycero) phosphate (BMP), an essential co-factor for lysosomal sphingomyelin metabolism(12-14). In acidic environments Hsp70 binds with high affinity and specificity to BMP, thereby facilitating the BMP binding and activity of acid sphingomyelinase (ASM). The inhibition of the Hsp70-BMP interaction by BMP antibodies or a point mutation in Hsp70 (Trp90Phe), as well as the pharmacological and genetic inhibition of ASM, effectively revert the Hsp70-mediated stabilization of lysosomes. Notably, the reduced ASM activity in cells from patients with Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) A and B-severe lysosomal storage disorders caused by mutations in the sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 1 gene (SMPD1) encoding for ASM(15)-is also associated with a marked decrease in lysosomal stability, and this phenotype can be effectively corrected by treatment with recombinant Hsp70. Taken together, these data open exciting possibilities for the development of new treatments for lysosomal storage disorders and cancer with compounds that enter the lysosomal lumen by the endocytic delivery pathway.","[Kirkegaard, Thomas; Petersen, Nikolaj H.

Immediately after fertilization, both the maternal and paternal genomes undergo dramatic reprogramming to prepare for the transition from germ cell to somatic cell transcription programs(1). One of the molecular events that takes place during this transition is the demethylation of the paternal genome(2,3). Despite extensive efforts, the factors responsible for paternal DNA demethylation have not been identified(4). To search for such factors, we developed a live cell imaging system that allows us to monitor the paternal DNA methylation state in zygotes. Through short-interfering-RNA-mediated knockdown in mouse zygotes, we identified Elp3 (also called KAT9), a component of the elongator complex(5), to be important for paternal DNA demethylation. We demonstrate that knockdown of Elp3 impairs paternal DNA demethylation as indicated by reporter binding, immunostaining and bisulphite sequencing. Similar results were also obtained when other elongator components, Elp1 and Elp4, were knocked down. Importantly, injection of messenger RNA encoding the Elp3 radical SAM domain mutant, but not the HAT domain mutant, into MII oocytes before fertilization also impaired paternal DNA demethylation, indicating that the SAM radical domain is involved in the demethylation process. Our study not only establishes a critical role for the elongator complex in zygotic paternal genome demethylation, but also indicates that the demethylation process may be mediated through a reaction that requires an intact radical SAM domain.","[Okada, Yuki; Hong, Kwonho; Zhang, Yi] Univ N Carolina, Lineberger Comprehens Canc Ctr, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Okada, Yuki; Hong, Kwonho; Zhang, Yi] Univ N Carolina, Lineberger Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Yamagata, Kazuo; Wakayama, Teruhiko] RIKEN, Ctr Dev Biol, Lab Genom Reprogramming, Chuo Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan","Zhang, Y (reprint author), Univ N Carolina, Lineberger Comprehens Canc Ctr, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",yi_zhang@med.unc.edu,,,"Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM068804, R01 GM068804-07]",,,30,191,197,0,26,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,28-Jan,2010,463,7280,,,,,554,U177,,10.1038/nature08732,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,548QK,WOS:000273981100054,20054296.0,No,,,11/20/17,yi,zhang,female,0.56,68,na,na

Fatty acids are composed of long alkyl chains and represent nature's 'petroleum', being a primary metabolite used by cells for both chemical and energy storage functions. These energy-rich molecules are today isolated from plant and animal oils for a diverse set of products ranging from fuels to oleochemicals. A more scalable, controllable and economic route to this important class of chemicals would be through the microbial conversion of renewable feedstocks, such as biomass-derived carbohydrates. Here we demonstrate the engineering of Escherichia coli to produce structurally tailored fatty esters (biodiesel), fatty alcohols, and waxes directly from simple sugars. Furthermore, we show engineering of the biodiesel-producing cells to express hemi-cellulases, a step towards producing these compounds directly from hemicellulose, a major component of plant-derived biomass.","[Steen, Eric J.; Kang, Yisheng; Bokinsky, Gregory; Keasling, Jay D.] Joint BioEnergy Inst, Emeryville, CA 94608 USA; [Steen, Eric J.; Keasling, Jay D.] Synthet Biol Engn Res Ctr, Emeryville, CA 94608 USA; [Steen, Eric J.; Keasling, Jay D.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Bioengn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kang, Yisheng; Bokinsky, Gregory; Keasling, Jay D.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Inst QB3, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Keasling, Jay D.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Hu, Zhihao; Schirmer, Andreas; McClure, Amy; del Cardayre, Stephen B.] LS9 Inc, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Keasling, Jay D.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Phys Biosci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Keasling, JD (reprint author), Joint BioEnergy Inst, 5885 Hollis Ave, Emeryville, CA 94608 USA.",delc@ls9.com; keasling@berkeley.edu,"Keasling, Jay/J-9162-2012","Keasling, Jay/0000-0003-4170-6088","Tien Scholar Environmental Fellowship; Synthetic Biology Engineering Research Center (SynBERC); LS9, Inc.

DNA methylation(3-5) provides a potential epigenetic mechanism for the cellular memory needed to preserve the somatic progenitor state through repeated cell divisions. DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1)(6,7) maintains DNA methylation patterns after cellular replication. Although dispensable for embryonic stem cell maintenance(8), the role for DNMT1 in maintaining the progenitor state in constantly replenished somatic tissues, such as mammalian epidermis, is unclear. Here we show that DNMT1 is essential for epidermal progenitor cell function. DNMT1 protein was found enriched in undifferentiated cells, where it was required to retain proliferative stamina and suppress differentiation. In tissue, DNMT1 depletion led to exit from the progenitor cell compartment, premature differentiation and eventual tissue loss. Genome-wide analysis showed that a significant portion of epidermal differentiation gene promoters were methylated in self-renewing conditions but were subsequently demethylated during differentiation. Furthermore, UHRF1 (refs 9, 10), a component of the DNA methylation machinery that targets DNMT1 to hemi-methylated DNA, is also necessary to suppress premature differentiation and sustain proliferation. In contrast, Gadd45A(11,12) and B(13), which promote active DNA demethylation, are required for full epidermal differentiation gene induction. These data demonstrate that proteins involved in the dynamic regulation of DNA methylation patterns are required for progenitor maintenance and self-renewal in mammalian somatic tissue.","[Sen, George L.; Reuter, Jason A.; Webster, Daniel E.; Zhu, Lilly; Khavari, Paul A.] Stanford Univ, Program Epithelial Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Sen, George L.; Reuter, Jason A.; Webster, Daniel E.; Zhu, Lilly; Khavari, Paul A.] Stanford Univ, Program Canc Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Sen, George L.; Reuter, Jason A.; Webster, Daniel E.; Zhu, Lilly; Khavari, Paul A.] Stanford Univ, Stanford Inst Stem Cell Biol & Regenerat Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Khavari, Paul A.] Vet Affairs Palo Alto Healthcare Syst, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA","Khavari, PA (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Program Epithelial Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",khavari@stanford.edu,,,USVA Office of Research and Development; NIH/NIAMS [AR45192]; LVMH Recherche; NIH [AR055849],"This work was supported by the USVA Office of Research and Development, NIH/NIAMS AR45192, an unrestricted research gift from LVMH Recherche to P.

Clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) loci protect bacteria and archaea from invasion by phage and plasmid DNA through a genetic interference pathway(1-9). CRISPR loci are present in similar to 40% and similar to 90% of sequenced bacterial and archaeal genomes, respectively(10), and evolve rapidly, acquiring new spacer sequences to adapt to highly dynamic viral populations(1,11-13). Immunity requires a sequence match between the invasive DNA and the spacers that lie between CRISPR repeats(1-9). Each cluster is genetically linked to a subset of the cas (CRISPR-associated) genes(14-16) that collectively encode >40 families of proteins involved in adaptation and interference. CRISPR loci encode small CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) that contain a full spacer flanked by partial repeat sequences(2,17-19). CrRNA spacers are thought to identify targets by direct Watson-Crick pairing with invasive 'protospacer' DNA(2,3), but how they avoid targeting the spacer DNA within the encoding CRISPR locus itself is unknown. Here we have defined the mechanism of CRISPR self/non-self discrimination. In Staphylococcus epidermidis, target/crRNA mismatches at specific positions outside of the spacer sequence license foreign DNA for interference, whereas extended pairing between crRNA and CRISPR DNA repeats prevents autoimmunity. Hence, this CRISPR system uses the base-pairing potential of crRNAs not only to specify a target, but also to spare the bacterial chromosome from interference. Differential complementarity outside of the spacer sequence is a built-in feature of all CRISPR systems, indicating that this mechanism is a broadly applicable solution to the self/non-self dilemma that confronts all immune pathways.","[Marraffini, Luciano A.; Sontheimer, Erik J.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Biochem Mol Biol & Cell Biol, Evanston, IL 60208 USA","Marraffini, LA (reprint author), Northwestern Univ, Dept Biochem Mol Biol & Cell Biol, 2205 Tech Dr, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",l-marraffini@northwestern.edu; erik@northwestern.edu,,"Sontheimer, Erik/0000-0002-0881-0310","National Institutes of Health, USA","We thank N.

The assembled contigs (2.25 gigabases (Gb)) cover approximately 94% of the whole genome, and the remaining gaps (0.05 Gb) seem to contain carnivore-specific repeats and tandem repeats. Comparisons with the dog and human showed that the panda genome has a lower divergence rate. The assessment of panda genes potentially underlying some of its unique traits indicated that its bamboo diet might be more dependent on its gut microbiome than its own genetic composition. We also identified more than 2.7 million heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms in the diploid genome.

A mesenchymal phenotype is the hallmark of tumour aggressiveness in human malignant glioma, but the regulatory programs responsible for implementing the associated molecular signature are largely unknown. Here we show that reverse-engineering and an unbiased interrogation of a glioma-specific regulatory network reveal the transcriptional module that activates expression of mesenchymal genes in malignant glioma. Two transcription factors (C/EBP beta and STAT3) emerge as synergistic initiators and master regulators of mesenchymal transformation. Ectopic co-expression of C/EBP beta and STAT3 reprograms neural stem cells along the aberrant mesenchymal lineage, whereas elimination of the two factors in glioma cells leads to collapse of the mesenchymal signature and reduces tumour aggressiveness. In human glioma, expression of C/EBP beta and STAT3 correlates with mesenchymal differentiation and predicts poor clinical outcome. These results show that the activation of a small regulatory module is necessary and sufficient to initiate and maintain an aberrant phenotypic state in cancer cells.","[Carro, Maria Stella; Zhao, Xudong; Anne, Sandrine L.; Lasorella, Anna; Califano, Andrea; Iavarone, Antonio] Columbia Univ, Med Ctr, Inst Canc Genet, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Lim, Wei Keat; Califano, Andrea] Columbia Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Biomed Informat, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Lim, Wei Keat; Alvarez, Mariano Javier; Califano, Andrea] Columbia Univ, Med Ctr, Ctr Computat Biol & Bioinformat, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Alvarez, Mariano Javier; Califano, Andrea] Columbia Univ, Med Ctr, Joint Ctr Syst Biol, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Doetsch, Fiona; Lasorella, Anna; Iavarone, Antonio] Columbia Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Lasorella, Anna] Columbia Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Pediat, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Iavarone, Antonio] Columbia Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Neurol, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Bollo, Robert J.] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Neurosurg, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Bollo, Robert J.] NYU, Langone Med Ctr, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Snyder, Evan Y.] Burnham Inst Med Res, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Sulman, Erik P.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Div Radiat Oncol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Colman, Howard] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Neurooncol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Aldape, Ken] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Pathol, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Califano, A (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Med Ctr, Inst Canc Genet, New York, NY 10032 USA.",califano@c2b2.columbia.edu; ai2102@columbia.edu,"Califano, Andrea/F-7239-2012",,"National Institute of Health [R01CA109755, R01CA101644, R01CA085628, R01NS061776]; NCI Grand Opportunities TDDN Network [1RC2CA148308-01]; In Silico Research Centre of Excellence [NCI-caBIG 29XS192]; National Centers for Biomedical Computing NIH Roadmap Initiative [U54CA121852]; National Institute of General Medical Sciences [P20GM075059]; Italian Ministry of Welfare/Provincia di Benevento; Fondation de Recherche Medicale","This work was supported by National Institute of Health grants R01CA109755 (A.

This focus was elegantly set in motion a decade ago with the design and construction of a genetic toggle switch and an oscillator, with subsequent highlights that have included circuits capable of pattern generation, noise shaping, edge detection and event counting. Here we describe an engineered gene network with global intercellular coupling that is capable of generating synchronized oscillations in a growing population of cells. Using microfluidic devices tailored for cellular populations at differing length scales, we investigate the collective synchronization properties along with spatiotemporal waves occurring at millimetre scales. We use computational modelling to describe quantitatively the observed dependence of the period and amplitude of the bulk oscillations on the flow rate. The synchronized genetic clock sets the stage for the use of microbes in the creation of a macroscopic biosensor with an oscillatory output. Furthermore, it provides a specific model system for the generation of a mechanistic description of emergent coordinated behaviour at the colony level.","[Danino, Tal; Mondragon-Palomino, Octavio; Hasty, Jeff] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Bioengn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Tsimring, Lev; Hasty, Jeff] Univ Calif San Diego, BioCircuits Inst, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Hasty, Jeff] Univ Calif, Div Biol Sci, Mol Biol Sect, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Hasty, J (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Bioengn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",hasty@bioeng.ucsd.edu,,,National Institutes of Health and General Medicine [GM69811]; DOE CSGF; CONACyT (Mexico) [184646],"We thank J.

'Unweathered' asteroids (those having spectra matching the most commonly falling ordinary chondrite meteorites), however, are seen among small bodies the orbits of which cross inside Mars and the Earth. Various explanations have been proposed for the origin of these fresh surface colours, ranging from collisions(4) to planetary encounters(5). Less reddened asteroids seem to cross most deeply into the terrestrial planet region, strengthening(6) the evidence for the planetary-encounter theory(5), but encounter details within 10(6) years remain to be shown. Here we report that asteroids displaying unweathered spectra (so-called 'Q-types'(7)) have experienced orbital intersections closer than the Earth-Moon distance within the past 5 x 10(5) years. These Q-type asteroids are not currently found among asteroids showing no evidence of recent close planetary encounters. Our results substantiate previous work(5): tidal stress(8), strong enough to disturb and expose unweathered surface grains, is the most likely dominant short-term asteroid resurfacing process. Although the seismology details are yet to be worked out, the identification of rapid physical processes that can produce both fresh and weathered asteroid surfaces resolves the decades-long(9) puzzle of the difference in colour of asteroids and meteorites.","[Binzel, Richard P.] MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Binzel, Richard P.; Birlan, Mirel] Observ Paris, IMCCE, F-75014 Paris, France; [Morbidelli, Alessandro] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, CNRS, Dept Cassiopee, Observ Cote Azur, F-06304 Nice, France; [Merouane, Sihane; DeMeo, Francesca E.] Observ Paris, LESIA, F-92195 Meudon, France; [Vernazza, Pierre] ESA, ESTEC, NL-2200 AG Noordwijk, Netherlands; [Thomas, Cristina A.] No Arizona Univ, Dept Phys, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Thomas, Cristina A.] No Arizona Univ, Dept Astron, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Rivkin, Andrew S.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Appl Phys Lab, Laurel, MD 20723 USA; [Bus, Schelte J.; Tokunaga, Alan T.] Univ Hawaii, Inst Astron, Hilo, HI 96720 USA","Binzel, RP (reprint author), MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",rpb@mit.edu,"Rivkin, Andrew/B-7744-2016; BIRLAN, Mirel/B-5283-2011","Rivkin, Andrew/0000-0002-9939-9976; Thomas, Cristina/0000-0003-3091-5757",National Science Foundation [0506716]; NASA [NAG5-12355],"R.

Using micro-compression and in situ nano-compression experiments, here we find that the stress required for deformation twinning increases drastically with decreasing sample size of a titanium alloy single crystal(7,8), until the sample size is reduced to one micrometre, below which the deformation twinning is entirely replaced by less correlated, ordinary dislocation plasticity. Accompanying the transition in deformation mechanism, the maximum flow stress of the submicrometre-sized pillars was observed to saturate at a value close to titanium's ideal strength(9,10). We develop a 'stimulated slip' model to explain the strong size dependence of deformation twinning. The sample size in transition is relatively large and easily accessible in experiments, making our understanding of size dependence(11-17) relevant for applications.","[Yu, Qian; Shan, Zhi-Wei; Xiao, Lin; Sun, Jun; Ma, Evan] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, CAMP Nano, State Key Lab Mech Behav Mat, Xian 710049, Peoples R China; [Shan, Zhi-Wei] Hysitron Inc, Minneapolis, MN 55344 USA; [Li, Ju] Univ Penn, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Huang, Xiaoxu] Tech Univ Denmark, Riso Natl Lab Sustainable Energy, Mat Res Div, Danish Chinese Ctr Nanomet, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; [Ma, Evan] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA","Sun, J (reprint author), Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, CAMP Nano, State Key Lab Mech Behav Mat, Xian 710049, Peoples R China.",liju@seas.upenn.edu; junsun@mail.xjtu.edu.cn,"Shan, Zhiwei/B-8799-2014; xjtu, campnano/Q-1904-2015; Huang, Xiaoxu/N-2856-2017; Li, Ju/A-2993-2008; Ma, En/A-3232-2010; Yu, Qian/C-5949-2013","Huang, Xiaoxu/0000-0002-4635-6112; Li, Ju/0000-0002-7841-8058; ","NSFC [50671077, 50720145101, 50831004, 50925104]; 973 Program of China [2004CB619303, 2007CB613804, 2010CB613003]; 111 Project of China [B06025]; ONR [N00014-05-1-0504]; NSF [CMMI-0728069]; MRSEC [DMR-0520020]; AFOSR [FA9550-08-1-0325]; Danish National Research Foundation; US Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]","We thank Q.

Given increasing environmental issues, the idea of replacing plastics with water-based gels, so-called hydrogels, seems reasonable. Here we report that water and clay (2-3 per cent by mass), when mixed with a very small proportion (<0.4 per cent by mass) of organic components, quickly form a transparent hydrogel. This material can be moulded into shape-persistent, free-standing objects owing to its exceptionally great mechanical strength, and rapidly and completely self-heals when damaged. Furthermore, it preserves biologically active proteins for catalysis. So far(1) no other hydrogels, including conventional ones formed by mixing polymeric cations and anions(2,3) or polysaccharides and borax(4), have been reported to possess all these features.

High concentrations of tropospheric ozone are toxic, however, and have a detrimental effect on human health and ecosystem productivity(1). Moreover, tropospheric ozone itself acts as an effective greenhouse gas(2). Much of the present tropospheric ozone burden is a consequence of anthropogenic emissions of ozone precursors(3) resulting in widespread increases in ozone concentrations since the late 1800s(3-7). At present, east Asia has the fastest-growing ozone precursor emissions(8). Much of the springtime east Asian pollution is exported eastwards towards western North America(9). Despite evidence that the exported Asian pollution produces ozone(10), no previous study has found a significant increase in free tropospheric ozone concentrations above the western USA since measurements began in the late 1970s(5,11,12). Here we compile springtime ozone measurements from many different platforms across western North America. We show a strong increase in springtime ozone mixing ratios during 1995-2008 and we have some additional evidence that a similar rate of increase in ozone mixing ratio has occurred since 1984. We find that the rate of increase in ozone mixing ratio is greatest when measurements are more heavily influenced by direct transport from Asia. Our result agrees with previous modelling studies, which indicate that global ozone concentrations should be increasing during the early part of the twenty-first century as a result of increasing precursor emissions, especially at northern mid-latitudes(13), with western North America being particularly sensitive to rising Asian emissions(14). We suggest that the observed increase in springtime background ozone mixing ratio may hinder the USA's compliance with its ozone air quality standard.","[Cooper, O.

It is one of the more distinctive metaphors of evolutionary biology, but no test of its claim that speciation occurs at a constant rate(2) has ever been made against competing models that can predict virtually identical outcomes, nor has any mechanism been proposed that could cause the constant-rate phenomenon. Here we use 101 phylogenies of animal, plant and fungal taxa to test the constant-rate claim against four competing models. Phylogenetic branch lengths record the amount of time or evolutionary change between successive events of speciation. The models predict the distribution of these lengths by specifying how factors combine to bring about speciation, or by describing how rates of speciation vary throughout a tree. We find that the hypotheses that speciation follows the accumulation of many small events that act either multiplicatively or additively found support in 8% and none of the trees, respectively. A further 8% of trees hinted that the probability of speciation changes according to the amount of divergence from the ancestral species, and 6% suggested speciation rates vary among taxa. By comparison, 78% of the trees fit the simplest model in which new species emerge from single events, each rare but individually sufficient to cause speciation. This model predicts a constant rate of speciation, and provides a new interpretation of the Red Queen: the metaphor of species losing a race against a deteriorating environment is replaced by a view linking speciation to rare stochastic events that cause reproductive isolation. Attempts to understand species-radiations(3) or why some groups have more or fewer species should look to the size of the catalogue of potential causes of speciation shared by a group of closely related organisms rather than to how those causes combine.","[Venditti, Chris; Meade, Andrew; Pagel, Mark] Univ Reading, Sch Biol Sci, Reading RG6 6BX, Berks, England; [Pagel, Mark] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA","Pagel, M (reprint author), Univ Reading, Sch Biol Sci, Reading RG6 6BX, Berks, England.",m.pagel@reading.ac.uk,,,"Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), UK; Leverhulme Trust","We thank the Centre for Advanced Computing and Emerging Technologies (ACET) at the University of Reading for the use of the ThamesBlue supercomputer.

If phenotypes are robust against mutation, we might expect that a population will have difficulty adapting to an environmental change, as several studies have suggested(1-4). However, other studies contend that robust organisms are more adaptable(5-8). A quantitative understanding of the relationship between robustness and evolvability will help resolve these conflicting reports and will clarify outstanding problems in molecular and experimental evolution, evolutionary developmental biology and protein engineering. Here we demonstrate, using a general population genetics model, that mutational robustness can either impede or facilitate adaptation, depending on the population size, the mutation rate and the structure of the fitness landscape. In particular, neutral diversity in a robust population can accelerate adaptation as long as the number of phenotypes accessible to an individual by mutation is smaller than the total number of phenotypes in the fitness landscape. These results provide a quantitative resolution to a significant ambiguity in evolutionary theory.","[Draghi, Jeremy A.; Parsons, Todd L.; Plotkin, Joshua B.] Univ Penn, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Plotkin, Joshua B.] Univ Penn, Program Appl Math & Computat Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Wagner, Guenter P.] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Plotkin, JB (reprint author), Univ Penn, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",jplotkin@sas.upenn.edu,"Plotkin, Joshua/E-6947-2013","Wagner, Gunter/0000-0002-3097-002X",Burroughs Wellcome Fund; David and Lucile Packard Foundation; James S.

Evidence from animal studies in rodents shows that testosterone causes aggressive behaviour towards conspecifics(7). Folk wisdom generalizes and adapts these findings to humans, suggesting that testosterone induces antisocial, egoistic, or even aggressive human behaviours. However, many researchers have questioned this folk hypothesis(1-6), arguing that testosterone is primarily involved in status-related behaviours in challenging social interactions, but causal evidence that discriminates between these views is sparse. Here we show that the sublingual administration of a single dose of testosterone in women causes a substantial increase in fair bargaining behaviour, thereby reducing bargaining conflicts and increasing the efficiency of social interactions. However, subjects who believed that they received testosterone-regardless of whether they actually received it or not-behaved much more unfairly than those who believed that they were treated with placebo. Thus, the folk hypothesis seems to generate a strong negative association between subjects' beliefs and the fairness of their offers, even though testosterone administration actually causes a substantial increase in the frequency of fair bargaining offers in our experiment.","[Eisenegger, C.; Naef, M.; Snozzi, R.; Fehr, E.] Univ Zurich, Inst Empir Res Econ, Lab Social & Neural Syst Res, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; [Naef, M.] Univ London, Dept Econ, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England; [Heinrichs, M.] Univ Freiburg, Dept Psychol, Lab Biol & Personal Psychol, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany","Eisenegger, C (reprint author), Univ Zurich, Inst Empir Res Econ, Lab Social & Neural Syst Res, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.",eisenegger@iew.uzh.ch; efehr@iew.uzh.ch,"Naef, Michael/B-2257-2009","Naef, Michael/0000-0002-0810-2912",National Center of Competence in Affective Sciences; Neurochoice Project of SystemsX; Swiss National Science Foundation,"This paper is part of the Research Priority Program 'Foundations of Human Social Behaviour-Altruism versus Egoism' at the University of Zurich.

To determine further the genetics of ccRCC, we have sequenced 101 cases through 3,544 protein-coding genes. Here we report the identification of inactivating mutations in two genes encoding enzymes involved in histone modification-SETD2, a histone H3 lysine 36 methyltransferase, and JARID1C (also known as KDM5C), a histone H3 lysine 4 demethylase-as well as mutations in the histone H3 lysine 27 demethylase, UTX (KMD6A), that we recently reported(3). The results highlight the role of mutations in components of the chromatin modification machinery in human cancer. Furthermore, NF2 mutations were found in non-VHL mutated ccRCC, and several other probable cancer genes were identified. These results indicate that substantial genetic heterogeneity exists in a cancer type dominated by mutations in a single gene, and that systematic screens will be key to fully determining the somatic genetic architecture of cancer.","[Khoo, Sok Kean; Petillo, David; Teh, Bin Tean] Van Andel Res Inst, Lab Canc Genert, Grand Rapids, MI 49503 USA; [Anema, John; Kahnoski, Richard J.] Spectrum Hlth Hosp, Dept Urol, Grand Rapids, MI 49503 USA; [Teh, Bin Tean] Natl Canc Ctr, NCCS VARI Translat Canc Res Lab, Singapore 169610, Singapore; [Stratton, Michael R.] Inst Canc Res, Sutton SM2 5NG, Surrey, England; [Furge, Kyle; Dykema, Karl J.; Wondergem, Bill] Van Andel Res Inst, Lab Computat Biol, Grand Rapids, MI 49503 USA; [Dalgliesh, Gillian L.; Greenman, Chris; Chen, Lina; Bignell, Graham; Butler, Adam; Davies, Helen; Edkins, Sarah; Hardy, Claire; Latimer, Calli; Teague, Jon; Andrews, Jenny; Barthorpe, Syd; Beare, Dave; Buck, Gemma; Campbell, Peter J.; Forbes, Simon; Jia, Mingming; Jones, David; Knott, Henry; Kok, Chai Yin; Lau, King Wai; Leroy, Catherine; Lin, Meng-Lay; McBride, David J.; Maddison, Mark; Maguire, Simon; McLay, Kirsten; Menzies, Andrew; Mironenko, Tatiana; Mulderrig, Lee; Mudie, Laura; O'Meara, Sarah; Pleasance, Erin; Rajasingham, Arjunan; Shepherd, Rebecca; Smith, Raffaella; Stebbings, Lucy; Stephens, Philip; Tang, Gurpreet; Tarpey, Patrick S.; Turrell, Kelly; Stratton, Michael R.; Futreal, P.

This long-observed phenomenon is known as aerobic glycolysis(1), and is important for cell growth(2,3). Because aerobic glycolysis is only useful to growing cells, it is tightly regulated in a proliferation-linked manner(4). In mammals, this is partly achieved through control of pyruvate kinase isoform expression. The embryonic pyruvate kinase isoform, PKM2, is almost universally re-expressed in cancer(2), and promotes aerobic glycolysis, whereas the adult isoform, PKM1, promotes oxidative phosphorylation(2). These two isoforms result from mutually exclusive alternative splicing of the PKM pre-mRNA, reflecting inclusion of either exon 9 (PKM1) or exon 10 (PKM2). Here we show that three heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) proteins, polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB, also known as hnRNPI), hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2, bind repressively to sequences flanking exon 9, resulting in exon 10 inclusion. We also demonstrate that the oncogenic transcription factor c-Myc upregulates transcription of PTB, hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2, ensuring a high PKM2/PKM1 ratio. Establishing a relevance to cancer, we show that human gliomas overexpress c-Myc, PTB, hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2 in a manner that correlates with PKM2 expression. Our results thus define a pathway that regulates an alternative splicing event required for tumour cell proliferation.","[David, Charles J.; Chen, Mo; Manley, James L.] Columbia Univ, Dept Biol Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Assanah, Marcela; Canoll, Peter] Columbia Univ, Dept Pathol & Cell Biol, New York, NY 10032 USA","Manley, JL (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Dept Biol Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA.",jlm2@columbia.edu,,"Manley, James/0000-0002-8341-1459",Avon Foundation; NIH,"We thank D.

An important class of immune effector molecules to fight pathogen infections are antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that are produced in plants and animals(1). In Drosophila, the induction of AMPs in response to infection is regulated through the activation of the evolutionarily conserved Toll and immune deficiency (IMD) pathways(2). Here we show that AMP activation can be achieved independently of these immunoregulatory pathways by the transcription factor FOXO, a key regulator of stress resistance, metabolism and ageing. In non-infected animals, AMP genes are activated in response to nuclear FOXO activity when induced by starvation, using insulin signalling mutants, or by applying small molecule inhibitors. AMP induction is lost in foxo null mutants but enhanced when FOXO is overexpressed. Expression of AMP genes in response to FOXO activity can also be triggered in animals unable to respond to immune challenges due to defects in both the Toll and IMD pathways. Molecular experiments at the Drosomycin promoter indicate that FOXO directly binds to its regulatory region, thereby inducing its transcription. In vivo studies in Drosophila, but also studies in human lung, gut, kidney and skin cells indicate that a FOXO-dependent regulation of AMPs is evolutionarily conserved. Our results indicate a new mechanism of cross-regulation of metabolism and innate immunity by which AMP genes can be activated under normal physiological conditions in response to the oscillating energy status of cells and tissues. This regulation seems to be independent of the pathogen-responsive innate immunity pathways whose activation is often associated with tissue damage and repair. The sparse production of AMPs in epithelial tissues in response to FOXO may help modulating the defence reaction without harming the host tissues, in particular when animals are suffering from energy shortage or stress.","[Becker, Thomas; Loch, Gerrit; Zinke, Ingo; Aschenbrenner, Anna C.; Carrera, Pilar; Hoch, Michael] Univ Bonn, Dev Genet & Mol Physiol Unit, LIMES Inst, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Beyer, Marc; Inhester, Therese; Schultze, Joachim L.] Univ Bonn, Mol Immune & Cell Biol Unit, LIMES Inst, D-53115 Bonn, Germany","Hoch, M (reprint author), Univ Bonn, Dev Genet & Mol Physiol Unit, LIMES Inst, Carl Troll Str 31, D-53115 Bonn, Germany.",m.hoch@uni-bonn.de,"Schultze, Joachim/D-7794-2011","Schultze, Joachim/0000-0003-2812-9853; Aschenbrenner, Anna/0000-0002-9429-5457","DFG [SFBs 645, 704]","For sending flies and constructs, we thank M.

The full repertoire of cyclin D1 functions in normal development and oncogenesis is unclear at present. Here we developed Flag-and haemagglutinin-tagged cyclin D1 knock-in mouse strains that allowed a high-throughput mass spectrometry approach to search for cyclin D1-binding proteins in different mouse organs. In addition to cell cycle partners, we observed several proteins involved in transcription. Genome-wide location analyses (chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to DNA microarray; ChIP-chip) showed that during mouse development cyclin D1 occupies promoters of abundantly expressed genes. In particular, we found that in developing mouse retinas-an organ that critically requires cyclin D1 function(3,4)-cyclin D1 binds the upstream regulatory region of the Notch1 gene, where it serves to recruit CREB binding protein (CBP) histone acetyltransferase. Genetic ablation of cyclin D1 resulted in decreased CBP recruitment, decreased histone acetylation of the Notch1 promoter region, and led to decreased levels of the Notch1 transcript and protein in cyclin D1-null (Ccnd1(-/-)) retinas. Transduction of an activated allele of Notch1 into Ccnd1(-/-) retinas increased proliferation of retinal progenitor cells, indicating that upregulation of Notch1 signalling alleviates the phenotype of cyclin D1-deficiency. These studies show that in addition to its well-established cell cycle roles, cyclin D1 has an in vivo transcriptional function in mouse development. Our approach, which we term 'genetic-proteomic', can be used to study the in vivo function of essentially any protein.","[Bienvenu, Frederic; Jirawatnotai, Siwanon; Odajima, Junko; Geng, Yan; Zagozdzon, Agnieszka; Jecrois, Marie; Sicinski, Piotr] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Bienvenu, Frederic; Jirawatnotai, Siwanon; Odajima, Junko; Geng, Yan; Zagozdzon, Agnieszka; Jecrois, Marie; Sicinski, Piotr] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Elias, Joshua E.; Gygi, Steven P.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Meyer, Clifford A.; Liu, X.

These oligomeric protein machines, similar to 1 megadalton, consist of two back-to-back rings encompassing a central cavity that accommodates polypeptide substrates(1-3). Chaperonin-mediated protein folding is critically dependent on the closure of a built-in lid(4,5), which is triggered by ATP hydrolysis(6). The structural rearrangements and molecular events leading to lid closure are still unknown. Here we report four single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of Mm-cpn, an archaeal group II chaperonin(5,7), in the nucleotide-free (open) and nucleotide-induced (closed) states. The 4.3 angstrom resolution of the closed conformation allowed building of the first ever atomic model directly from the single particle cryo-EM density map, in which we were able to visualize the nucleotide and more than 70% of the side chains. The model of the open conformation was obtained by using the deformable elastic network modelling with the 8 angstrom resolution open-state cryo-EM density restraints. Together, the open and closed structures show how local conformational changes triggered by ATP hydrolysis lead to an alteration of intersubunit contacts within and across the rings, ultimately causing a rocking motion that closes the ring. Our analyses show that there is an intricate and unforeseen set of interactions controlling allosteric communication and inter-ring signalling, driving the conformational cycle of group II chaperonins. Beyond this, we anticipate that our methodology of combining single particle cryo-EM and computational modelling will become a powerful tool in the determination of atomic details involved in the dynamic processes of macromolecular machines in solution.","[Zhang, Junjie; Ludtke, Steven J.; Chiu, Wah] Baylor Coll Med, Grad Program Struct & Computat Biol & Mol Biophys, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Zhang, Junjie; Baker, Matthew L.; Jakana, Joanita; Dougherty, Matthew; Fu, Caroline J.; Ludtke, Steven J.; Chiu, Wah] Baylor Coll Med, Natl Ctr Macromol Imaging, Verna & Marrs McLean Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Schroeder, Gunnar F.; Levitt, Michael] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Struct, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Douglas, Nicholai R.; Reissmann, Stefanie; Frydman, Judith] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Douglas, Nicholai R.; Reissmann, Stefanie; Frydman, Judith] Stanford Univ, BioX Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Chiu, W (reprint author), Baylor Coll Med, Grad Program Struct & Computat Biol & Mol Biophys, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",jfrydman@stanford.edu; wah@bcm.edu,"Levitt, Michael/E-4582-2012; Schroder, Gunnar/H-5261-2013","Levitt, Michael/0000-0002-8414-7397; Schroder, Gunnar/0000-0003-1803-5431",National Institutes of Health through the Nanomedicine Development Center Roadmap Initiative; Biomedical Technology Research Center for Structural Biology in National Center for Research Resources; Nanobiology Training Fellowship; National Science Foundation,"We acknowledge the support of grants from the National Institutes of Health through the Nanomedicine Development Center Roadmap Initiative, Biomedical Technology Research Center for Structural Biology in National Center for Research Resources, Nanobiology Training Fellowship administered by the Keck Center of the Gulf Coast Consortia and the National Science Foundation.",,39,134,136,2,27,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Jan,2010,463,7279,,,,,379,U130,,10.1038/nature08701,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,545PM,WOS:000273748100049,20090755.0,No,,,11/20/17,wah,chiu,male,0.95,19,QgGaAdsAAAAJ,23821

Worldwide, tobacco smoking is the principal lifestyle exposure that causes cancer, exerting carcinogenicity through >60 chemicals that bind and mutate DNA. Using massively parallel sequencing technology, we sequenced a small-cell lung cancer cell line, NCI-H209, to explore the mutational burden associated with tobacco smoking. A total of 22,910 somatic substitutions were identified, including 134 in coding exons. Multiple mutation signatures testify to the cocktail of carcinogens in tobacco smoke and their proclivities for particular bases and surrounding sequence context. Effects of transcription-coupled repair and a second, more general, expression-linked repair pathway were evident. We identified a tandem duplication that duplicates exons 3-8 of CHD7 in frame, and another two lines carrying PVT1-CHD7 fusion genes, indicating that CHD7 may be recurrently rearranged in this disease. These findings illustrate the potential for next-generation sequencing to provide unprecedented insights into mutational processes, cellular repair pathways and gene networks associated with cancer.","[Pleasance, Erin D.; Stephens, Philip J.; O'Meara, Sarah; McBride, David J.; Jones, David; Lin, Meng-Lay; Beare, David; Lau, King Wai; Greenman, Chris; Varela, Ignacio; Nik-Zainal, Serena; Davies, Helen R.; Ordonez, Gonzalo R.; Mudie, Laura J.; Latimer, Calli; Edkins, Sarah; Stebbings, Lucy; Chen, Lina; Jia, Mingming; Leroy, Catherine; Marshall, John; Menzies, Andrew; Butler, Adam; Teague, Jon W.; Stratton, Michael R.; Futreal, P.

A subset of these somatic alterations, termed driver mutations, confer selective growth advantage and are implicated in cancer development, whereas the remainder are passengers. Here we have sequenced the genomes of a malignant melanoma and a lymphoblastoid cell line from the same person, providing the first comprehensive catalogue of somatic mutations from an individual cancer. The catalogue provides remarkable insights into the forces that have shaped this cancer genome. The dominant mutational signature reflects DNA damage due to ultraviolet light exposure, a known risk factor for malignant melanoma, whereas the uneven distribution of mutations across the genome, with a lower prevalence in gene footprints, indicates that DNA repair has been preferentially deployed towards transcribed regions. The results illustrate the power of a cancer genome sequence to reveal traces of the DNA damage, repair, mutation and selection processes that were operative years before the cancer became symptomatic.","[Pleasance, Erin D.; Stephens, Philip J.; McBride, David J.; Greenman, Chris D.; Varela, Ignacio; Lin, Meng-Lay; Ordonez, Gonzalo R.; Bignell, Graham R.; Beare, David; Butler, Adam; Chen, Lina; Edkins, Sarah; Jia, Mingming; Leroy, Catherine; Marshall, John; Menzies, Andrew; Mudie, Laura J.; Ning, Zemin; Stebbings, Lucy A.; Teague, Jon; Campbell, Peter J.; Futreal, P.

The limited catalytic efficiency of Rubisco has sparked extensive efforts to re-engineer the enzyme with the goal of enhancing agricultural productivity. To facilitate such efforts we analysed the formation of cyanobacterial form I Rubisco by in vitro reconstitution and cryo-electron microscopy. We show that RbcL subunit folding by the GroEL/GroES chaperonin is tightly coupled with assembly mediated by the chaperone RbcX(2). RbcL monomers remain partially unstable and retain high affinity for GroEL until captured by RbcX(2). As revealed by the structure of a RbcL(8)-(RbcX2)(8) assembly intermediate, RbcX(2) acts as a molecular staple in stabilizing the RbcL subunits as dimers and facilitates RbcL(8) core assembly. Finally, addition of RbcS results in RbcX(2) release and holoenzyme formation. Specific assembly chaperones may be required more generally in the formation of complex oligomeric structures when folding is closely coupled to assembly.","[Liu, Cuimin; Starling-Windhof, Amanda; Bracher, Andreas; Saschenbrecker, Sandra; Rao, Bharathi Vasudeva; Rao, Karnam Vasudeva; Hartl, F.

Most observed dwarf galaxies consist of a rotating stellar disk(2) embedded in a massive dark-matter halo with a near-constant-density core(3). Models based on the dominance of CDM, however, invariably form galaxies with dense spheroidal stellar bulges and steep central dark-matter profiles(4-6), because low-angular-momentum baryons and dark matter sink to the centres of galaxies through accretion and repeated mergers(7). Processes that decrease the central density of CDM halos(8) have been identified, but have not yet reconciled theory with observations of present-day dwarfs. This failure is potentially catastrophic for the CDM model, possibly requiring a different dark-matter particle candidate(9). Here we report hydrodynamical simulations (in a framework(10) assuming the presence of CDM and a cosmological constant) in which the inhomogeneous interstellar medium is resolved. Strong outflows from supernovae remove low-angular-momentum gas, which inhibits the formation of bulges and decreases the dark-matter density to less than half of what it would otherwise be within the central kiloparsec. The analogues of dwarf galaxies-bulgeless and with shallow central dark-matter profiles-arise naturally in these simulations.","[Governato, F.; Quinn, T.] Univ Washington, Dept Astron, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Brook, C.] Univ Cent Lancashire, Jeremiah Horrocks Inst, Preston PR1 2HE, Lancs, England; [Mayer, L.] Univ Zurich, Inst Theoret Phys, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Brooks, A.] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Rhee, G.] Univ Nevada, Dept Phys & Astron, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA; [Wadsley, J.; Stinson, G.] McMaster Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M1, Canada; [Jonsson, P.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Inst Particle Phys, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Madau, P.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Astron & Astrophys, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Willman, B.] Haverford Coll, Dept Astron, Haverford, PA 19041 USA","Governato, F (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Astron, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",fabio@astro.washington.edu,,,,,,30,561,565,0,9,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Jan,2010,463,7278,,,,,203,206,,10.1038/nature08640,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,543MQ,WOS:000273582700029,20075915.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,p.,madau,na,na,na,na,na

Because the rotation periods of the two stars are tidally locked to the orbital period, the rapid rotation drives a magnetic dynamo. A large body of evidence points to the existence of an extended, complex coronal magnetosphere originating at the cooler K subgiant(1-4). The detailed morphology of the subgiant's corona and its possible interaction with its companion are unknown, though theory predicts that the coronal plasma should be confined in a magnetic loop structure(5), as seen on the Sun. Here we report multi-epoch radio imaging of the Algol system, in which we see a large, persistent coronal loop approximately one subgiant diameter in height, whose base is straddling the subgiant and whose apex is oriented towards the B8 star. This suggests that a persistent asymmetric magnetic field structure is aligned between the two stars. The loop is larger than anticipated theoretically(6,7), but the size may be the result of a magnetic interaction between the two stars.","[Peterson, W. M.; Mutel, R.

Chiral spin liquids are a hypothetical class of spin liquids in which the time-reversal symmetry is macroscopically broken in the absence of an applied magnetic field or any magnetic dipole long-range order. Even though such chiral spin-liquid states were proposed more than two decades ago(1-3), an experimental realization and observation of such states has remained a challenge. One of the characteristic order parameters in such systems is a macroscopic average of the scalar spin chirality, a solid angle subtended by three nearby spins. In previous experimental reports, however, the spin chirality was only parasitic to the non-coplanar spin structure associated with a magnetic dipole long-range order or induced by the applied magnetic field(4-10), and thus the chiral spin-liquid state has never been found. Here, we report empirical evidence that the time-reversal symmetry can be broken spontaneously on a macroscopic scale in the absence of magnetic dipole long-range order. In particular, we employ the anomalous Hall effect(4,11) to directly probe the broken time-reversal symmetry for the metallic frustrated magnet Pr(2)Ir(2)O(7). An onset of the Hall effect is observed at zero field in the absence of uniform magnetization, within the experimental accuracy, suggesting an emergence of a chiral spin liquid. The origin of this spontaneous Hall effect is ascribed to chiral spin textures(4,5,12,13), which are inferred from the magnetic measurements indicating the spin ice-rule formation(14,15).","[Machida, Yo; Nakatsuji, Satoru; Tayama, Takashi; Sakakibara, Toshiro] Univ Tokyo, Inst Solid State Phys, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778581, Japan; [Onoda, Shigeki] RIKEN, Condensed Matter Theory Lab, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan","Nakatsuji, S (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Inst Solid State Phys, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778581, Japan.",satoru@issp.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Onoda, Shigeki/B-4322-2013","Onoda, Shigeki/0000-0001-6063-3166","Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan; Kurata Grant","We thank L.

Traditionally, the most widely used schemes for three-dimensional (3D) structure determination of an object are implemented by acquiring multiple measurements over various sample orientations, as in the case of crystallography and tomography(1,2), or by scanning a series of thin sections through the sample, as in confocal microscopy(3). Here we present a 3D imaging modality, termed ankylography (derived from the Greek words ankylos meaning 'curved' and graphein meaning 'writing'), which under certain circumstances enables complete 3D structure determination from a single exposure using a monochromatic incident beam. We demonstrate that when the diffraction pattern of a finite object is sampled at a sufficiently fine scale on the Ewald sphere, the 3D structure of the object is in principle determined by the 2D spherical pattern. We confirm the theoretical analysis by performing 3D numerical reconstructions of a sodium silicate glass structure at 2 angstrom resolution, and a single poliovirus at 2-3nm resolution, from 2D spherical diffraction patterns alone. Using diffraction data from a soft X-ray laser, we also provide a preliminary demonstration that ankylography is experimentally feasible by obtaining a 3D image of a test object from a single 2D diffraction pattern. With further development, this approach of obtaining complete 3D structure information from a single view could find broad applications in the physical and life sciences.","[Raines, Kevin S.; Salha, Sara; Jiang, Huaidong; Fahimian, Benjamin P.; Miao, Jianwei] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Phys & Astron, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Raines, Kevin S.; Salha, Sara; Jiang, Huaidong; Fahimian, Benjamin P.; Miao, Jianwei] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Calif NanoSyst Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Rodriguez, Jose A.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Mol Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Sandberg, Richard L.; Kapteyn, Henry C.] Univ Colorado, Dept Phys, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Sandberg, Richard L.; Kapteyn, Henry C.] Univ Colorado, JILA, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Du, Jincheng] Univ N Texas, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Denton, TX 76203 USA; [Du, Jincheng] Univ N Texas, Ctr Adv Sci Comp & Modeling, Denton, TX 76203 USA","Miao, JW (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Phys & Astron, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",miao@physics.ucla.edu,"Du, Jincheng/A-8052-2011; Sandberg, Richard/F-8790-2011; Kapteyn, Henry/H-6559-2011","Kapteyn, Henry/0000-0001-8386-6317","US DOE, Office of Basic Energy Sciences; US NSF, Division of Materials Research and Engineering Research Center; UCLA MBI Whitcome; NSF Center in EUV Science and Technology","We thank P.

This elevation is widely held to cause the plateau to serve as a heat source that drives the South Asian summer monsoon, potentially coupling uplift of the plateau to climate changes on geologic timescales(1-5). Observations of the present climate, however, do not clearly establish the Tibetan plateau as the dominant thermal forcing in the region: peak upper-tropospheric temperatures during boreal summer are located over continental India, south of the plateau. Here we show that, although Tibetan plateau heating locally enhances rainfall along its southern edge in an atmospheric model, the large-scale South Asian summer monsoon circulation is otherwise unaffected by removal of the plateau, provided that the narrow orography of the Himalayas and adjacent mountain ranges is preserved. Additional observational and model results suggest that these mountains produce a strong monsoon by insulating warm, moist air over continental India from the cold and dry extratropics. These results call for both a reinterpretation of how South Asian climate may have responded to orographic uplift, and a re-evaluation of how this climate may respond to modified land surface and radiative forcings in coming decades.","[Boos, William R.; Kuang, Zhiming] Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kuang, Zhiming] Harvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Boos, WR (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, 20 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",billboos@alum.mit.edu,"Boos, William/C-6467-2014","Boos, William/0000-0001-9076-3551",Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Harvard University; Harvard University Center for the Environment; NSF [ATM-0754332],"We thank P.

One major evolutionary puzzle has continued to capture the attention of naturalists for centuries: why do hosts of brood parasites generally fail to recognize parasitic offspring after they have hatched from the egg(5-9), even when the host and parasitic chicks differ to almost comic degrees(7)? One prominent theory to explain this pattern proposes that the costs of mistakenly learning to recognize the wrong offspring make recognition maladaptive(10). Here we show that American coots, Fulica americana, can recognize and reject parasitic chicks in their brood by using learned cues, despite the fact that the hosts and the brood parasites are of the same species. A series of chick cross-fostering experiments confirm that coots use first-hatched chicks in a brood as referents to learn to recognize their own chicks and then discriminate against later-hatched parasitic chicks in the same brood. When experimentally provided with the wrong reference chicks, coots can be induced to discriminate against their own offspring, confirming that the learning errors proposed by theory can exist(10). However, learning based on hatching order is reliable in naturally parasitized coot nests because host eggs hatch predictably ahead of parasite eggs. Conversely, a lack of reliable information may help to explain why the evolution of chick recognition is not more common in hosts of most interspecific brood parasites.","[Shizuka, Daizaburo; Lyon, Bruce E.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA","Shizuka, D (reprint author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",shizuka@biology.ucsc.edu,"Lyon, Bruce/E-8491-2011",,"National Geographic Society; National Science Foundation [DDIG IOS-0808579, IOS 0443807]; Chapman Fund; Sigma Xi Society","We thank J.

However, in no system have aggression pheromones, their cognate receptors and corresponding sensory neurons been identified. Here we show that 11-cis-vaccenyl acetate (cVA), a male-specific volatile pheromone, robustly promotes male-male aggression in the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster. The aggression-promoting effect of synthetic cVA requires olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) expressing the receptor Or67d(4-6), as well as the receptor itself. Activation of Or67d-expressing OSNs, either by genetic manipulation of their excitability or by exposure to male pheromones in the absence of other classes of OSNs, is sufficient to promote aggression. High densities of male flies can promote aggression by the release of volatile cVA. In turn, cVA-promoted aggression can promote male fly dispersal from a food resource, in a manner dependent on Or67d-expressing OSNs. These data indicate that cVA may mediate negative-feedback control of male population density, through its effect on aggression. Identification of a pheromone-OSN pair controlling aggression in a genetic organism opens the way to unravelling the neurobiology of this evolutionarily conserved behaviour.","[Wang, Liming; Anderson, David J.] CALTECH, Div Biol 216 76, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Anderson, David J.] CALTECH, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Anderson, DJ (reprint author), CALTECH, Div Biol 216 76, 1200 E Calif Blvd, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",lmwang@caltech.edu; wuwei@caltech.edu,"Wang, Liming/C-8402-2011",,"NSF [EF-0623527, MCB-0418479]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute","We thank B.

The classical form of LTP relies on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), and it has been shown that astroglia can regulate their activation through Ca(2+)-dependent release of the NMDAR co-agonist D-serine(2-4). Release of D-serine from glia enables LTP in cultures(5) and explains a correlation between glial coverage of synapses and LTP in the supraoptic nucleus(4). However, increases in Ca(2+) concentration in astroglia can also release other signalling molecules, most prominently glutamate(6-8), ATP(9) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha(10,11), whereas neurons themselves can synthesize and supply D-serine(12,13). Furthermore, loading an astrocyte with exogenous Ca(2+) buffers does not suppress LTP in hippocampal area CA1 (refs 14-16), and the physiological relevance of experiments in cultures or strong exogenous stimuli applied to astrocytes has been questioned(17,18). The involvement of glia in LTP induction therefore remains controversial. Here we show that clamping internal Ca(2+) in individual CA1 astrocytes blocks LTP induction at nearby excitatory synapses by decreasing the occupancy of the NMDAR co-agonist sites. This LTP blockade can be reversed by exogenous D-serine or glycine, whereas depletion of D-serine or disruption of exocytosis in an individual astrocyte blocks local LTP. We therefore demonstrate that Ca(2+)-dependent release of D-serine from an astrocyte controls NMDAR-dependent plasticity in many thousands of excitatory synapses nearby.","[Henneberger, Christian; Rusakov, Dmitri A.] UCL, UCL Inst Neurol, London WC1N 3BG, England; [Papouin, Thomas; Oliet, Stephane H.

Some are still active, notably in mice the highly polymorphic early transposon (ETn)/MusD and intracisternal A-type particles (IAP)(2,3). ERVs are transcriptionally silenced during early embryogenesis by histone and DNA methylation(4-6) (and reviewed in ref. 7), although the initiators of this process, which is essential to protect genome integrity(8), remain largely unknown. KAP1 (KRAB-associated protein 1, also known as tripartite motif-containing protein 28, TRIM28) represses genes by recruiting the histone methyltransferase SETDB1, heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) and the NuRD histone deacetylase complex(9), but few of its physiological targets are known. Two lines of evidence suggest that KAP1-mediated repression could contribute to the control of ERVs: first, KAP1 can trigger permanent gene silencing during early embryogenesis(10), and second, a KAP1 complex silences the retrovirus murine leukaemia virus in embryonic cells(11-13). Consistent with this hypothesis, here we show that KAP1 deletion leads to a marked upregulation of a range of ERVs, in particular IAP elements, in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and in early embryos. We further demonstrate that KAP1 acts synergistically with DNA methylation to silence IAP elements, and that it is enriched at the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) of IAP genomes, where KAP1 deletion leads to the loss of histone 3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3), a hallmark of KAP1-mediated repression. Correspondingly, IAP 5'UTR sequences can impose in cis KAP1-dependent repression on a heterologous promoter in ES cells. Our results establish that KAP1 controls endogenous retroelements during early embryonic development.","[Rowe, Helen M.; Jakobsson, Johan; Mesnard, Daniel; Rougemont, Jacques; Reynard, Severine; Maillard, Pierre V.; Layard-Liesching, Hillary; Verp, Sonia; Marquis, Julien; Constam, Daniel B.; Trono, Didier] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Sch Life Sci, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Aktas, Tugce; Spitz, Francois] EMBL Heidelberg, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany","Trono, D (reprint author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Sch Life Sci, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",didier.trono@epfl.ch,"Jakobsson, Johan/E-7745-2014","Jakobsson, Johan/0000-0003-0669-7673; Spitz, Francois/0000-0002-1960-829X; Constam, Daniel B./0000-0002-6256-3891",Swiss National Science Foundation; Infectigen Association and the Strauss Foundation; Swedish Research Council,"We thank P.

The two-dimensional pattern and density of stomata in the leaf epidermis are genetically and environmentally regulated to optimize gas exchange(2). Two putative intercellular signalling factors, EPF1 and EPF2, function as negative regulators of stomatal development in Arabidopsis, possibly by interacting with the receptor-like protein TMM(3-6). One or more positive intercellular signalling factors are assumed to be involved in stomatal development, but their identities are unknown(7). Here we show that a novel secretory peptide, which we designate as stomagen, is a positive intercellular signalling factor that is conserved among vascular plants. Stomagen is a 45-amino-acid, cysteine-rich peptide that is generated from a 102-amino-acid precursor protein designated as STOMAGEN. Both an in planta analysis and a semi-in-vitro analysis with recombinant and chemically synthesized stomagen peptides showed that stomagen has stomata-inducing activity in a dose-dependent manner. A genetic analysis showed that TMM is epistatic to STOMAGEN (At4g12970), suggesting that stomatal development is finely regulated by competitive binding of positive and negative regulators to the same receptor. Notably, STOMAGEN is expressed in inner tissues (the mesophyll) of immature leaves but not in the epidermal tissues where stomata develop. This study provides evidence of a mesophyll-derived positive regulator of stomatal density. Our findings provide a conceptual advancement in understanding stomatal development: inner photosynthetic tissues optimize their function by regulating stomatal density in the epidermis for efficient uptake of CO(2).","[Sugano, Shigeo S.; Shimada, Tomoo; Imai, Yu; Hara-Nishimura, Ikuko] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Okawa, Katsuya] Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co Ltd, Innovat Drug Res Labs, Taksasaki 3701295, Japan; [Tamai, Atsushi; Mori, Masashi] Ishikawa Prefectural Univ, Res Inst Bioresources & Biotechnol, Nonoichi, Ishikawa 9218836, Japan","Hara-Nishimura, I (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan.",ihnishi@gr.bot.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan [16085203, 17107002]; Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST)","We thank T.

Although Rho was the first termination factor to be discovered(4), the actual mechanism by which it reaches and disrupts the elongation complex (EC) is unknown. Here we show that the termination-committed Rho molecule associates with RNA polymerase (RNAP) throughout the transcription cycle; that is, it does not require the nascent transcript for initial binding. Moreover, the formation of the RNAP-Rho complex is crucial for termination. We show further that Rho-dependent termination is a two-step process that involves rapid EC inactivation (trap) and a relatively slow dissociation. Inactivation is the critical rate-limiting step that establishes the position of the termination site. The trap mechanism depends on the allosterically induced rearrangement of the RNAP catalytic centre by means of the evolutionarily conserved mobile trigger-loop domain, which is also required for EC dissociation. The key structural and functional similarities, which we found between Rho-dependent and intrinsic (Rho-independent) termination pathways, argue that the allosteric mechanism of termination is general and likely to be preserved for all cellular RNAPs throughout evolution.","[Epshtein, Vitaly; Dutta, Dipak; Nudler, Evgeny] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Wade, Joseph] SUNY Albany, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biomed Sci, Albany, NY 12201 USA","Nudler, E (reprint author), NYU, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, New York, NY 10016 USA.",evgeny.nudler@nyumc.org,,"Wade, Joseph/0000-0002-9779-3160; Nudler, Evgeny/0000-0002-8811-3071",National Institutes of Health [R01GM58750],"We thank I.

Subsequent rearrangements within the protein then affect intradomain and interdomain contact sites within the phytochrome dimer. On the basis of our models, we propose that phytochromes act by propagating reversible light-driven conformational changes in the bilin to altered contacts between the adjacent output domains, which in most phytochromes direct differential phosphotransfer.","[Ulijasz, Andrew T.; Zhang, Junrui; Vierstra, Richard D.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Genet, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Cornilescu, Gabriel; Cornilescu, Claudia C.; Markley, John L.] Univ Wisconsin, Natl Magnet Resonance Facil Madison, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Rivera, Mario] Univ Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66057 USA","Vierstra, RD (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Genet, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",vierstra@wisc.edu,"Cornilescu, Claudia/H-1959-2012; Zhang, Junrui/J-2684-2012; Cornilescu, Claudia/K-1981-2015; Cornilescu, Gabriel/H-3113-2011","Cornilescu, Claudia/0000-0002-2401-7806; Cornilescu, Gabriel/0000-0002-1204-8904",US National Science Foundation; American Heart Association; U.

During reconsolidation, stored information is rendered labile after being retrieved. Pharmacological manipulations at this stage result in an inability to retrieve the memories at later times, suggesting that they are erased or persistently inhibited. Unfortunately, the use of these pharmacological manipulations in humans can be problematic. Here we introduce a non-invasive technique to target the reconsolidation of fear memories in humans. We provide evidence that old fear memories can be updated with non-fearful information provided during the reconsolidation window. As a consequence, fear responses are no longer expressed, an effect that lasted at least a year and was selective only to reactivated memories without affecting others. These findings demonstrate the adaptive role of reconsolidation as a window of opportunity to rewrite emotional memories, and suggest a non-invasive technique that can be used safely in humans to prevent the return of fear.","[Schiller, Daniela; Monfils, Marie-H.; LeDoux, Joseph E.; Phelps, Elizabeth A.] NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Schiller, Daniela; Raio, Candace M.; Johnson, David C.; Phelps, Elizabeth A.] NYU, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Monfils, Marie-H.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Psychol, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Phelps, EA (reprint author), NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA.",liz.phelps@nyu.edu,"Monfils, Marie/F-1282-2013","Monfils, Marie-H./0000-0001-8971-6651","James S.

This has complicated our understanding of the origins of ubiquitination and its connection to proteasomes. Here we report two small archaeal modifier proteins, SAMP1 and SAMP2, with a beta-grasp fold and carboxy-terminal diglycine motif similar to ubiquitin, that form protein conjugates in the archaeon Haloferax volcanii. The levels of SAMP-conjugates were altered by nitrogen-limitation and proteasomal gene knockout and spanned various functions including components of the Urm1 pathway. LC-MS/MS-based collision-induced dissociation demonstrated isopeptide bonds between the C-terminal glycine of SAMP2 and the epsilon-amino group of lysines from a number of protein targets and Lys58 of SAMP2 itself, revealing poly-SAMP chains.

On a scale of similar to 100 parsecs (pc), fields of similar to 1,000 microgauss (mu G; refs 1-3) have been reported, implying a magnetic energy density more than 10,000 times stronger than typical for the Galaxy. Alternatively, the assumption of pressure equilibrium between the various phases of the Galactic Centre interstellar medium (including turbulent molecular gas, the contested(4) 'very hot' plasma, and the magnetic field) suggests fields of similar to 100 mu G over similar to 400 pc size scales(5). Finally, assuming equipartition, fields of only similar to 6 mu G have been inferred from radio observations(6) for 400 pc scales. Here we report a compilation of previous data that reveals a downward break in the region's non-thermal radio spectrum (attributable to a transition from bremsstrahlung to synchrotron cooling of the in situ cosmic-ray electron population). We show that the spectral break requires that the Galactic Centre field be at least similar to 50 mu G on 400 pc scales, lest the synchrotron-emitting electrons produce too much gamma-ray emission, given other existing constraints(7). Other considerations support a field of 100 mu G, implying that over 10% of the Galaxy's magnetic energy is contained in only less than or similar to 0.05% of its volume.","[Crocker, Roland M.] Monash Univ, Sch Phys, Clayton, Vic 3110, Australia; [Crocker, Roland M.; Jones, David I.] Max Planck Inst Kernphys, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Jones, David I.; Protheroe, Raymond J.] Univ Adelaide, Sch Phys & Chem, Dept Phys, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Jones, David I.] Australia Telescope Natl Facil, Marsfield, NSW 2122, Australia; [Melia, Fulvio] Univ Arizona, Dept Phys, Program Appl Math, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Melia, Fulvio] Univ Arizona, Steward Observ, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Ott, Juergen] Natl Radio Astron Observ, Socorro, NM 87801 USA; [Ott, Juergen] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Crocker, RM (reprint author), Monash Univ, Sch Phys, Clayton, Vic 3110, Australia.",Roland.Crocker@mpi-hd.mpg.de,,,,,,26,92,92,0,5,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Jan,2010,463,7277,,,,,65,67,,10.1038/nature08635,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,540OV,WOS:000273344900030,20054391.0,No,,,11/20/17,raymond j.,protheroe,na,na,na,na,na

It provides a natural description of the electron spin, predicts the existence of antimatter(2) and is able to reproduce accurately the spectrum of the hydrogen atom. The realm of the Dirac equation-relativistic quantum mechanics-is considered to be the natural transition to quantum field theory. However, the Dirac equation also predicts some peculiar effects, such as Klein's paradox(3) and 'Zitterbewegung', an unexpected quivering motion of a free relativistic quantum particle(4). These and other predicted phenomena are key fundamental examples for understanding relativistic quantum effects, but are difficult to observe in real particles. In recent years, there has been increased interest in simulations of relativistic quantum effects using different physical set-ups(5-11), in which parameter tunability allows access to different physical regimes. Here we perform a proof-of-principle quantum simulation of the one-dimensional Dirac equation using a single trapped ion(7) set to behave as a free relativistic quantum particle. We measure the particle position as a function of time and study Zitterbewegung for different initial superpositions of positive- and negative-energy spinor states, as well as the crossover from relativistic to non-relativistic dynamics.

Here we report the cooling of the motion of a radio-frequency nanomechanical resonator by parametric coupling to a driven, microwave-frequency superconducting resonator. Starting from a thermal occupation of 480 quanta, we have observed occupation factors as low as 3.8 +/- 1.3 and expect the mechanical resonator to be found with probability 0.21 in the quantum ground state of motion. Further cooling is limited by random excitation of the microwave resonator and heating of the dissipative mechanical bath.

Applications range from earthquake dynamics(1-4) to hard-drive read/write cycles(5). Frictional strength is governed by the resistance to shear of the large ensemble of discrete contacts that forms the interface that separates two sliding bodies. An interface's overall strength is determined by both the real contact area and the contacts' shear strength(6,7). Whereas the average motion of large, slowly sliding bodies is well-described by empirical friction laws(3,8-10), interface strength is a dynamic entity that is inherently related to both fast processes such as detachment/re-attachment(11-14) and the slow process of contact area rejuvenation(6,7,13,15,16). Here we show how frictional strength evolves from extremely short to long timescales, by continuous measurements of the concurrent local evolution of the real contact area and the corresponding interface motion (slip) from the first microseconds when contact detachment occurs to large (100-second) timescales. We identify four distinct and inter-related phases of evolution. First, all of the local contact area reduction occurs within a few microseconds, on the passage of a crack-like front. This is followed by the onset of rapid slip over a characteristic time, the value of which suggests a fracture-induced reduction of contact strength before any slip occurs. This rapid slip phase culminates with a sharp transition to slip at velocities an order of magnitude slower. At slip arrest, 'ageing' immediately commences as contact area increases on a characteristic timescale determined by the system's local memory of its effective contact time before slip arrest. We show how the singular logarithmic behaviour generally associated with ageing is cut off at short times(16).

Despite its importance, the mechanism and pathways of anthropogenic CO(2) uptake and transport are poorly understood. Regulation of the Southern Ocean carbon sink by the wind-driven Ekman flow, mesoscale eddies and their interaction is under debate(5-8). Here we use a high-resolution ocean circulation and carbon cycle model to address the mechanisms controlling the Southern Ocean sink of anthropogenic CO(2). The focus of our study is on the intra-annual variability in anthropogenic CO(2) over a two-year time period. We show that the pattern of carbon uptake is correlated with the oceanic vertical exchange. Zonally integrated carbon uptake peaks at the Antarctic polar front. The carbon is then advected away from the uptake regions by the circulation of the Southern Ocean, which is controlled by the interplay among Ekman flow, ocean eddies and subduction of water masses. Although lateral carbon fluxes are locally dominated by the imprint of mesoscale eddies, the Ekman transport is the primary mechanism for the zonally integrated, cross-frontal transport of anthropogenic CO(2). Intra-annual variability of the cross-frontal transport is dominated by the Ekman flow with little compensation from eddies. A budget analysis in the density coordinate highlights the importance of wind-driven transport across the polar front and subduction at the subtropical front. Our results suggest intimate connections between oceanic carbon uptake and climate variability through the temporal variability of Ekman transport.","[Ito, T.; Woloszyn, M.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Mazloff, M.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Ito, T (reprint author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, 1371 Campus Delivery, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",ito@atmos.colostate.edu,"Ito, Takamitsu/F-3856-2010","Ito, Takamitsu/0000-0001-9873-099X",US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) [NNX08AL72G]; US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NA08OAR4320893],T.

Although many other viruses, including non-retroviral RNA viruses, are known to generate DNA forms of their own genomes during replication(3-5), none has been found as DNA in the germline of animals. Bornaviruses, a genus of non-segmented, negative-sense RNA virus, are unique among RNA viruses in that they establish persistent infection in the cell nucleus(6-8). Here we show that elements homologous to the nucleoprotein (N) gene of bornavirus exist in the genomes of several mammalian species, including humans, non-human primates, rodents and elephants. These sequences have been designated endogenous Borna-like N (EBLN) elements. Some of the primate EBLNs contain an intact open reading frame (ORF) and are expressed as mRNA. Phylogenetic analyses showed that EBLNs seem to have been generated by different insertional events in each specific animal family. Furthermore, the EBLN of a ground squirrel was formed by a recent integration event, whereas those in primates must have been formed more than 40 million years ago. We also show that the N mRNA of a current mammalian bornavirus, Borna disease virus (BDV), can form EBLN-like elements in the genomes of persistently infected cultured cells. Our results provide the first evidence for endogenization of non-retroviral virus-derived elements in mammalian genomes and give novel insights not only into generation of endogenous elements, but also into a role of bornavirus as a source of genetic novelty in its host.","[Horie, Masayuki; Honda, Tomoyuki; Daito, Takuji; Ikuta, Kazuyoshi; Tomonaga, Keizo] Osaka Univ, Dept Virol, Res Inst Microbial Dis BIKEN, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Honda, Tomoyuki] Japan Soc Promot Sci, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1028472, Japan; [Suzuki, Yoshiyuki; Kobayashi, Yuki; Gojobori, Takashi] Natl Inst Genet, Ctr Informat Biol, Mishima, Shizuoka 4118540, Japan; [Suzuki, Yoshiyuki; Kobayashi, Yuki; Gojobori, Takashi] Natl Inst Genet, DNA Data Bank Japan, Mishima, Shizuoka 4118540, Japan; [Oshida, Tatsuo] Obihiro Univ Agr & Vet Med, Dept Life Sci & Agr, Obihiro, Hokkaido 0808555, Japan; [Jern, Patric; Coffin, John M.] Tufts Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol Biol & Microbiol, Boston, MA 02111 USA; [Tomonaga, Keizo] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, PRESTO, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1020075, Japan","Tomonaga, K (reprint author), Osaka Univ, Dept Virol, Res Inst Microbial Dis BIKEN, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan.",tomonaga@biken.osaka-u.ac.jp,,"Jern, Patric/0000-0003-3393-5825; Horie, Masayuki/0000-0003-4682-7698","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT); Japan Science and Technology Agency; Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of Japan; National Cancer Institute [R37 CA 089441]; Wenner-Gren Foundation; George Kirby Foundation","We thank A.

Here we describe a form of 'chronic active' BCR signalling that is required for cell survival in the activated B-cell-like (ABC) subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The signalling adaptor CARD11 is required for constitutive NF-kappa B pathway activity and survival in ABC DLBCL4. Roughly 10% of ABC DLBCLs have mutant CARD11 isoforms that activate NF-kappa B-5, but the mechanism that engages wild-type CARD11 in other ABC DLBCLs was unknown. An RNA interference genetic screen revealed that a BCR signalling component, Bruton's tyrosine kinase, is essential for the survival of ABC DLBCLs with wild-type CARD11. In addition, knockdown of proximal BCR subunits (IgM, Ig-kappa, CD79A and CD79B) killed ABC DLBCLs with wildtype CARD11 but not other lymphomas. The BCRs in these ABC DLBCLs formed prominent clusters in the plasma membrane with low diffusion, similarly to BCRs in antigen-stimulated normal B cells. Somatic mutations affecting the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) signalling modules(6) of CD79B and CD79A were detected frequently in ABC DLBCL biopsy samples but rarely in other DLBCLs and never in Burkitt's lymphoma or mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. In 18% of ABC DLBCLs, one functionally critical residue of CD79B, the first ITAM tyrosine, was mutated. These mutations increased surface BCR expression and attenuated Lyn kinase, a feedback inhibitor of BCR signalling. These findings establish chronic active BCR signalling as a new pathogenetic mechanism in ABC DLBCL, suggesting several therapeutic strategies.","[Davis, R.

However, functional differences between sister chromatids regulate daughter cell fate in yeast(1) and sister chromatid segregation is not random in Escherichia coli(2). Differentiated sister chromatids, coupled with non-random segregation, have been proposed to regulate cell fate during the development of multicellular organisms(3). This hypothesis has not been tested because molecular features to reliably distinguish between sister chromatids are not obvious. Here we show that parental 'Watson' and 'Crick' DNA template strands can be identified in sister chromatids of murine metaphase chromosomes using CO-FISH(chromosome orientation fluorescence in situ hybridization(4)) with unidirectional probes specific for centromeric and telomeric repeats. All chromosomes were found to have a uniform orientation with the 5' end of the short arm on the same strand as T-rich major satellite repeats. The invariable orientation of repetitive DNA was used to differentially label sister chromatids and directly study mitotic segregation patterns in different cell types. Whereas sister chromatids appeared to be randomly distributed between daughter cells in cultured lung fibroblasts and embryonic stem cells, significant non-random sister chromatid segregation was observed in a subset of colon crypt epithelial cells, including cells outside positions reported for colon stem cells(5). Our results establish that DNA template sequences can be used to distinguish sister chromatids and follow their mitotic segregation in vivo.","[Falconer, Ester; Chavez, Elizabeth A.; Henderson, Alexander; Poon, Steven S.

Here we show that members of the class of light-driven outward proton pumps can mediate powerful, safe, multiple-colour silencing of neural activity. The gene archaerhodopsin-3 (Arch)(1) from Halorubrum sodomense enables near-100% silencing of neurons in the awake brain when virally expressed in the mouse cortex and illuminated with yellow light. Arch mediates currents of several hundred picoamps at low light powers, and supports neural silencing currents approaching 900 pA at light powers easily achievable in vivo. Furthermore, Arch spontaneously recovers from light-dependent inactivation, unlike light-driven chloride pumps that enter long-lasting inactive states in response to light. These properties of Arch are appropriate to mediate the optical silencing of significant brain volumes over behaviourally relevant timescales. Arch function in neurons is well tolerated because pH excursions created by Arch illumination are minimized by self-limiting mechanisms to levels comparable to those mediated by channelrhodopsins(2,3) or natural spike firing. To highlight how proton pump ecological and genomic diversity may support new innovation, we show that the blue-green light-drivable proton pump from the fungus Leptosphaeria maculans(4) (Mac) can, when expressed in neurons, enable neural silencing by blue light, thus enabling alongside other developed reagents the potential for independent silencing of two neural populations by blue versus red light. Light-driven proton pumps thus represent a high-performance and extremely versatile class of 'optogenetic' voltage and ion modulator, which will broadly enable new neuro-scientific, biological, neurological and psychiatric investigations.","[Chow, Brian Y.; Han, Xue; Dobry, Allison S.; Qian, Xiaofeng; Chuong, Amy S.; Li, Mingjie; Henninger, Michael A.; Monahan, Patrick E.; Boyden, Edward S.] MIT, Media Lab, Synthet Neurobiol Grp, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Chow, Brian Y.; Han, Xue; Dobry, Allison S.; Qian, Xiaofeng; Chuong, Amy S.; Li, Mingjie; Henninger, Michael A.; Monahan, Patrick E.; Boyden, Edward S.] MIT, Dept Biol Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Chow, Brian Y.; Han, Xue; Dobry, Allison S.; Qian, Xiaofeng; Chuong, Amy S.; Li, Mingjie; Henninger, Michael A.; Belfort, Gabriel M.; Lin, Yingxi; Monahan, Patrick E.; Boyden, Edward S.] MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Chow, Brian Y.; Han, Xue; Dobry, Allison S.; Qian, Xiaofeng; Chuong, Amy S.; Li, Mingjie; Henninger, Michael A.; Belfort, Gabriel M.; Lin, Yingxi; Monahan, Patrick E.; Boyden, Edward S.] MIT, McGovern Inst Brain Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Boyden, ES (reprint author), MIT, Media Lab, Synthet Neurobiol Grp, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",esb@media.mit.edu,,,"NIH [DP2 OD002002-01, 1K99MH085944]; NSF [0835878, 0848804]; McGovern Institute Neurotechnology; Department of Defense, NARSAD; Alfred P.

B-and mantle-cell lymphomas, chronic myeloid leukaemia, and multiple myeloma(7-9), however, express abnormally high levels of MCL1, contributing to chemoresistance and disease relapse. The mechanism of MCL1 overexpression in cancer is not well understood. Here we show that the deubiquitinase USP9X stabilizes MCL1 and thereby promotes cell survival. USP9X binds MCL1 and removes the Lys 48-linked polyubiquitin chains that normally mark MCL1 for proteasomal degradation. Increased USP9X expression correlates with increased MCL1 protein in human follicular lymphomas and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. Moreover, patients with multiple myeloma overexpressing USP9X have a poor prognosis. Knockdown of USP9X increases MCL1 polyubiquitination, which enhances MCL1 turnover and cell killing by the BH3 mimetic ABT-737. These results identify USP9X as a prognostic and therapeutic target, and they show that deubiquitinases may stabilize labile oncoproteins in human malignancies.","[Schwickart, Martin; Huang, XiaoDong; O'Rourke, Karen; Dixit, Vishva M.] Genentech Inc, Dept Physiol Chem, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Lill, Jennie R.] Genentech Inc, Dept Prot Chem, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Liu, Jinfeng; Yue, Peng] Genentech Inc, Dept Bioinformat, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Ferrando, Ronald; French, Dorothy M.; Eastham-Anderson, Jeffrey] Genentech Inc, Dept Pathol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Bazan, Fernando] Genentech Inc, Dept Prot Engn, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Maecker, Heather] Genentech Inc, Dept Translat Oncol, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Dornan, David] Genentech Inc, Dept Res Oncol Diagnost, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Huang, David C.

They are the largest group of therapeutic targets for a broad spectrum of diseases. Recent crystal structures of GPCRs(1-5) have revealed structural conservation extending from the orthosteric ligand-binding site in the transmembrane core to the cytoplasmic G-protein-coupling domains. In contrast, the extracellular surface (ECS) of GPCRs is remarkably diverse and is therefore an ideal target for the discovery of subtype-selective drugs. However, little is known about the functional role of the ECS in receptor activation, or about conformational coupling of this surface to the native ligand-binding pocket. Here we use NMR spectroscopy to investigate ligand-specific conformational changes around a central structural feature in the ECS of the beta(2) adrenergic receptor: a salt bridge linking extracellular loops 2 and 3. Small-molecule drugs that bind within the transmembrane core and exhibit different efficacies towards G-protein activation (agonist, neutral antagonist and inverse agonist) also stabilize distinct conformations of the ECS. We thereby demonstrate conformational coupling between the ECS and the orthosteric binding site, showing that drugs targeting this diverse surface could function as allosteric modulators with high subtype selectivity. Moreover, these studies provide a new insight into the dynamic behaviour of GPCRs not addressable by static, inactive-state crystal structures.","[Bokoch, Michael P.; Zou, Yaozhong; Rasmussen, Soren G.

At least two cell cycle-regulated protein kinase systems, the S-phase-specific cyclin-dependent protein kinases (S-CDKs) and the Dbf4-Cdc7 kinase (DDK, Dbf4-dependent protein kinase) are essential activators for initiation of DNA replication(1-5). Although the essential mechanism of CDK activation of DNA replication in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been established(6,7), exactly how DDK acts has been unclear. Here we show that the amino terminal serine/threonine-rich domain (NSD) of Mcm4 has both inhibitory and facilitating roles in DNA replication control and that the sole essential function of DDK is to relieve an inhibitory activity residing within the NSD. By combining an mcm4 mutant lacking the inhibitory activity with mutations that bypass the requirement for CDKs for initiation of DNA replication, we show that DNA synthesis can occur in G1 phase when CDKs and DDK are limited. However, DDK is still required for efficient S phase progression. In the absence of DDK, CDK phosphorylation at the distal part of the Mcm4 NSD becomes crucial. Moreover, DDK-null cells fail to activate the intra-S-phase checkpoint in the presence of hydroxyurea-induced DNA damage and are unable to survive this challenge. Our studies establish that the eukaryote-specific NSD of Mcm4 has evolved to integrate several protein kinase regulatory signals for progression through S phase.","[Sheu, Yi-Jun; Stillman, Bruce] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA","Stillman, B (reprint author), Cold Spring Harbor Lab, 1 Bungtown Rd, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA.",stillman@cshl.edu,,"Stillman, Bruce/0000-0002-9453-4091",US National Institute of General Medical Sciences,"Acknowledgements We thank A.

Left unrepaired or incorrectly repaired they can lead to genomic changes that may result in cell death or cancer. DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), a holoenzyme that comprises the DNA-PK catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) 4,5 and the heterodimer Ku70/Ku80, has a major role in non-homologous end joining-the main pathway in mammals used to repair double-strand breaks(6-8). DNA-PKcs is a serine/threonine protein kinase comprising a single polypeptide chain of 4,128 amino acids and belonging to the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3) K)-related protein family(9). DNA-PKcs is involved in the sensing and transmission of DNA damage signals to proteins such as p53, setting off events that lead to cell cycle arrest(10,11). It phosphorylates a wide range of substrates in vitro, including Ku70/Ku80, which is translocated along DNA(12). Here we present the crystal structure of human DNA-PKcs at 6.6 angstrom resolution, in which the overall fold is clearly visible, to our knowledge, for the first time. The many alpha-helical HEAT repeats (helix-turn-helix motifs) facilitate bending and allow the polypeptide chain to fold into a hollow circular structure. The carboxy-terminal kinase domain is located on top of this structure, and a small HEAT repeat domain that probably binds DNA is inside. The structure provides a flexible cradle to promote DNA double-strand-break repair.","[Sibanda, Bancinyane L.; Chirgadze, Dimitri Y.; Blundell, Tom L.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Biochem, Cambridge CB2 1GA, England","Sibanda, BL (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Biochem, Old Addenbrookes Site,80 Tennis Court Rd, Cambridge CB2 1GA, England.",lynn@cryst.bioc.cam.ac.uk; dima@cryst.bioc.cam.ac.uk,,,Wellcome Trust; CR-UK,"We wish to thank G.

Here we use a paired-end sequencing strategy to identify somatic rearrangements in breast cancer genomes. There are more rearrangements in some breast cancers than previously appreciated. Rearrangements are more frequent over gene footprints and most are intrachromosomal. Multiple rearrangement architectures are present, but tandem duplications are particularly common in some cancers, perhaps reflecting a specific defect in DNA maintenance. Short overlapping sequences at most rearrangement junctions indicate that these have been mediated by non-homologous end-joining DNA repair, although varying sequence patterns indicate that multiple processes of this type are operative. Several expressed in-frame fusion genes were identified but none was recurrent. The study provides a new perspective on cancer genomes, highlighting the diversity of somatic rearrangements and their potential contribution to cancer development.","[Stephens, Philip J.; McBride, David J.; Lin, Meng-Lay; Varela, Ignacio; Pleasance, Erin D.; Simpson, Jared T.; Stebbings, Lucy A.; Leroy, Catherine; Edkins, Sarah; Mudie, Laura J.; Greenman, Chris D.; Jia, Mingming; Latimer, Calli; Teague, Jon W.; Lau, King Wai; Burton, John; Quail, Michael A.; Swerdlow, Harold; Churcher, Carol; Futreal, P.

The ATP-dependent chromatin assembly factor (ACF) forms such structures in vitro and is required for silencing in vivo. ACF generates and maintains nucleosome spacing by constantly moving a nucleosome towards the longer flanking DNA faster than the shorter flanking DNA. How the enzyme rapidly moves back and forth between both sides of a nucleosome to accomplish bidirectional movement is unknown. Here we show that nucleosome movement depends cooperatively on two ACF molecules, indicating that ACF functions as a dimer of ATPases. Further, the nucleotide state determines whether the dimer closely engages one or both sides of the nucleosome. Three-dimensional reconstruction by single-particle electron microscopy of the ATPase-nucleosome complex in an activated ATP state reveals a dimer architecture in which the two ATPases face each other. Our results indicate a model in which the two ATPases work in a coordinated manner, taking turns to engage either side of a nucleosome, thereby allowing processive bidirectional movement. This novel dimeric motor mechanism differs from that of dimeric motors such as kinesin and dimeric helicases that processively translocate unidirectionally and reflects the unique challenges faced by motors that move nucleosomes.","[Cheng, Yifan; Narlikar, Geeta J.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem & Biophys, WM Keck Adv Microscopy Lab, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA","Narlikar, GJ (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Biochem & Biophys, WM Keck Adv Microscopy Lab, 600 16th St, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA.",ycheng@ucsf.edu; geeta.narlikar@ucsf.edu,"Yang, Janet/P-2003-2015","Acevedo, Ashley/0000-0002-3002-9854",Sandler Family Supporting Foundation; UCSF Academic Senate Shared Equipment Grant; National Institutes of Health; Beckman Foundation; US National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowships,"We thank J.

'Blue stragglers' are stars massive enough(2) that they should have evolved into white dwarfs long ago. Two possible mechanisms have been proposed for their formation: mass transfer between binary companions(3) and stellar mergers resulting from direct collisions between two stars(4). Recently the binary explanation was claimed to be dominant(5). Here we report that there are two distinct parallel sequences of blue stragglers in M 30. This globular cluster is thought to have undergone 'core collapse', during which both the collision rate and the mass transfer activity in binary systems would have been enhanced(6). We suggest that the two observed sequences are a consequence of cluster core collapse, with the bluer population arising from direct stellar collisions and the redder one arising from the evolution of close binaries that are probably still experiencing an active phase of mass transfer.","[Ferraro, F.

They are thought to derive from normal main-sequence stars that have undergone a recent increase in mass. Statistical evidence indicates that in globular star clusters the blue stragglers probably form from binary stars(1). The specific formation processes, such as mass transfer, mergers or stellar collisions during dynamical encounters of binary stars, remain unresolved. Here we report that 16 of the 21 blue stragglers ( 76 per cent) in the old (7-Gyr; ref. 2) open cluster NGC188 are currently in binary systems, a frequency three times that found among normal solar-type main-sequence stars. These blue straggler binaries have a remarkable period-eccentricity distribution, with all but three having orbital periods of similar to 1,000 days. Moreover, these stars are rotating faster than normal main-sequence stars of the same surface temperatures. These data show that most, and possibly all, blue stragglers derive from multiple-star systems, and indicate that the several formation processes operate simultaneously. We suggest that rapid rotation of blue stragglers may place upper limits on their ages.","[Mathieu, Robert D.; Geller, Aaron M.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Astron, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Mathieu, RD (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Astron, 475 N Charter St, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",mathieu@astro.wisc.edu,,,US National Science Foundation [AST-0406615]; Wisconsin Space Grant Consortium,"We thank the staff of the WIYN Observatory and the many graduate and undergraduate students who have assisted in observing NGC188.

Previous estimates of the field strength range from 1.8-2.5 mu G and the field was thought to be parallel to the Galactic plane(1) or inclined by 38-60 degrees (ref. 2) or 60-90 degrees (ref. 3) to this plane. These estimates relied either on indirect observational inferences or modelling in which the interstellar neutral hydrogen was not taken into account. Here we report measurements of the deflection of the solar wind plasma flows in the heliosheath(4) to determine the magnetic field strength and orientation in the interstellar medium. We find that the field strength in the local interstellar medium is 3.7-5.5 mu G. The field is tilted similar to 20-30 degrees from the interstellar medium flow direction (resulting from the peculiar motion of the Sun in the Galaxy) and is at an angle of about 30 degrees from the Galactic plane.

For example, a field-effect transistor relies on the gated electrostatic modulation of the channel charge produced by changing the relative position of the conduction and valence bands with respect to the electrodes. In molecular-scale devices(2-10), a longstanding challenge has been to create a true three-terminal device that operates in this manner (that is, by modifying orbital energy). Here we report the observation of such a solid-state molecular device, in which transport current is directly modulated by an external gate voltage. Resonance-enhanced coupling to the nearest molecular orbital is revealed by electron tunnelling spectroscopy, demonstrating direct molecular orbital gating in an electronic device. Our findings demonstrate that true molecular transistors can be created, and so enhance the prospects for molecularly engineered electronic devices.","[Song, Hyunwook; Lee, Takhee] Gwangju Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Nanobio Mat & Elect, Kwangju 500712, South Korea; [Song, Hyunwook; Jang, Yun Hee; Lee, Takhee] Gwangju Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Kwangju 500712, South Korea; [Kim, Youngsang; Jeong, Heejun] Hanyang Univ, Dept Appl Phys, Ansan 426791, South Korea; [Reed, Mark A.] Yale Univ, Dept Elect Engn, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Reed, Mark A.] Yale Univ, Dept Appl Phys, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Lee, T (reprint author), Gwangju Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Nanobio Mat & Elect, Kwangju 500712, South Korea.",mark.reed@yale.edu; tlee@gist.ac.kr,"Kim, Youngsang/G-3964-2014","Kim, Youngsang/0000-0002-8994-4897","Korean National Research Laboratory programme; Korean National Core Research Center; World Class University programme of the Korean Ministry of Education, Science and Technology; Program for Integrated Molecular System at the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology; SystemIC2010 project of the Korean Ministry of Knowledge Economy; US Army Research Office [W911NF-08-1-0365]; Canadian Institute for Advanced Research","This work was supported by the Korean National Research Laboratory programme; a Korean National Core Research Center grant; the World Class University programme of the Korean Ministry of Education, Science and Technology; the Program for Integrated Molecular System at the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology; the SystemIC2010 project of the Korean Ministry of Knowledge Economy; the US Army Research Office (W911NF-08-1-0365); and the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research.",,30,431,432,12,150,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Dec,2009,462,7276,,,,,1039,1043,,10.1038/nature08639,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,535UB,WOS:000272996000043,20033044.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,takhee,lee,na,na,na,na,na

Coastal ecosystems are therefore sensitive to alteration of both the quantity and lability of terrigenous dissolved organic matter (DOM) delivered by rivers. The lability of DOM is thought to vary with age, with younger, relatively unaltered organic matter being more easily metabolized by aquatic heterotrophs than older, heavily modified material(2-4). This view is developed exclusively from work in watersheds where terrestrial plant and soil sources dominate streamwater DOM. Here we characterize streamwater DOM from 11 coastal watersheds on the Gulf of Alaska that vary widely in glacier coverage (0-64 per cent). In contrast to non-glacial rivers, we find that the bioavailability of DOM to marine microorganisms is significantly correlated with increasing (14)C age. Moreover, the most heavily glaciated watersheds are the source of the oldest (similar to 4 kyr (14)C age) and most labile (66 per cent bioavailable) DOM. These glacial watersheds have extreme runoff rates, in part because they are subject to some of the highest rates of glacier volume loss on Earth(5). We estimate the cumulative flux of dissolved organic carbon derived from glaciers contributing runoff to the Gulf of Alaska at 0.13 +/- 0.01 Tg yr(-1) (1 Tg = 10(12) g), of which similar to 0.10 Tg is highly labile. This indicates that glacial runoff is a quantitatively important source of labile reduced carbon to marine ecosystems. Moreover, because glaciers and ice sheets represent the second largest reservoir of water in the global hydrologic system, our findings indicate that climatically driven changes in glacier volume could alter the age, quantity and reactivity of DOM entering coastal oceans.","[Hood, Eran] Univ Alaska SE, Environm Sci & Geog Program, Juneau, AK 99801 USA; [Fellman, Jason] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Inst Arctic Biol, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Spencer, Robert G.

A thorough explanation of the geologic process responsible for tremor generation has, however, yet to be determined. Owing to their location at the plate interface, temporal correlation with geodetically measured slow-slip events and dominant shear wave energy, tremor observations in southwest Japan have been interpreted as a superposition of many low-frequency earthquakes that represent slip on a fault surface(2,3). Fluids may also be fundamental to the failure process in subduction zone environments, as teleseismic and tidal modulation of tremor in Cascadia and Japan and high Poisson ratios in both source regions are indicative of pressurized pore fluids(3-7). Here we identify a robust correlation between extremely small, tidally induced shear stress parallel to the San Andreas fault and non-volcanic tremor activity near Parkfield, California. We suggest that this tremor represents shear failure on a critically stressed fault in the presence of near-lithostatic pore pressure. There are a number of similarities between tremor in subduction zone environments, such as Cascadia and Japan, and tremor on the deep San Andreas transform(3-12), suggesting that the results presented here may also be applicable in other tectonic settings.","[Thomas, Amanda M.; Nadeau, Robert M.; Buergmann, Roland] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Berkeley Seismol Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Thomas, AM (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Berkeley Seismol Lab, 307 McCone Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",amthomas@berkeley.edu,"Nadeau, Robert/G-1884-2017","Nadeau, Robert/0000-0003-1255-0643","National Science Foundation [EAR-0537641, EAR-0544730]; US Geological Survey [06HQGR0167, 07HQAG0014, 08HQGR0100]","We thank D.

As temperatures rise, ecosystems with 'nowhere to go', such as mountains, are considered to be more threatened(2,3). However, species survival may depend as much on keeping pace with moving climates as the climate's ultimate persistence(4,5). Here we present a new index of the velocity of temperature change (km yr(-1)), derived from spatial gradients (degrees C km(-1)) and multimodel ensemble forecasts of rates of temperature increase (degrees C yr(-1)) in the twenty-first century. This index represents the instantaneous local velocity along Earth's surface needed to maintain constant temperatures, and has a global mean of 0.42 km yr(-1) (A1B emission scenario). Owing to topographic effects, the velocity of temperature change is lowest in mountainous biomes such as tropical and subtropical coniferous forests (0.08 km yr(-1)), temperate coniferous forest, and montane grasslands. Velocities are highest in flooded grasslands (1.26 km yr(-1)), mangroves and deserts. High velocities suggest that the climates of only 8% of global protected areas have residence times exceeding 100 years. Small protected areas exacerbate the problem in Mediterranean-type and temperate coniferous forest biomes. Large protected areas may mitigate the problem in desert biomes. These results indicate management strategies for minimizing biodiversity loss from climate change. Montane landscapes may effectively shelter many species into the next century. Elsewhere, reduced emissions, a much expanded network of protected areas(6), or efforts to increase species movement may be necessary(7).","[Loarie, Scott R.; Duffy, Philip B.; Asner, Gregory P.; Field, Christopher B.] Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Global Ecol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Duffy, Philip B.] Climate Cent Inc, Palo Alto, CA 94301 USA; [Hamilton, Healy] Calif Acad Sci, Ctr Appl Biodivers Informat, San Francisco, CA 94118 USA; [Ackerly, David D.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Loarie, SR (reprint author), Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Global Ecol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",loarie@stanford.edu,"Ackerly, David/A-1247-2009; Asner, Gregory/G-9268-2013","Ackerly, David/0000-0002-1847-7398; Asner, Gregory/0000-0001-7893-6421",Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation; Stanford University Global Climate and Energy Project,This work was made possible through the support of the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and the Stanford University Global Climate and Energy Project.,,31,705,726,55,777,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Dec,2009,462,7276,,,,,1052,U111,,10.1038/nature08649,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,535UB,WOS:000272996000046,20033047.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,david d.,ackerly,male,1,1,_umQuNkAAAAJ,27340

There are now nearly 1,000 completed bacterial and archaeal genomes available(2), most of which were chosen for sequencing on the basis of their physiology. As a result, the perspective provided by the currently available genomes is limited by a highly biased phylogenetic distribution(3-5). To explore the value added by choosing microbial genomes for sequencing on the basis of their evolutionary relationships, we have sequenced and analysed the genomes of 56 culturable species of Bacteria and Archaea selected to maximize phylogenetic coverage. Analysis of these genomes demonstrated pronounced benefits ( compared to an equivalent set of genomes randomly selected from the existing database) in diverse areas including the reconstruction of phylogenetic history, the discovery of new protein families and biological properties, and the prediction of functions for known genes from other organisms. Our results strongly support the need for systematic 'phylogenomic' efforts to compile a phylogeny-driven 'Genomic Encyclopedia of Bacteria and Archaea' in order to derive maximum knowledge from existing microbial genome data as well as from genome sequences to come.","[Wu, Dongying; Hugenholtz, Philip; Mavromatis, Konstantinos; Dalin, Eileen; Ivanova, Natalia N.; Kunin, Victor; Hooper, Sean D.; Pati, Amrita; Lykidis, Athanasios; Anderson, Iain J.; D'haeseleer, Patrik; Lapidus, Alla; Nolan, Matt; Copeland, Alex; Chen, Feng; Cheng, Jan-Fang; Lucas, Susan; Kerfeld, Cheryl; Chain, Patrick; Rubin, Edward M.; Kyrpides, Nikos C.; Eisen, Jonathan A.] DOE Joint Genome Inst, Walnut Creek, CA 94598 USA; [Wu, Dongying; Singer, Mitchell; Eisen, Jonathan A.] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Pukall, Ruediger; Tindall, Brian J.; Spring, Stefan; Lang, Elke; Gronow, Sabine; Klenk, Hans-Peter] Deutsch Sammlung Mikroorganism Zellkultur GmbH, German Collect Microorganisms & Cell Cultures, D-38124 Braunschweig, Germany; [Goodwin, Lynne; Han, Cliff; Chain, Patrick; Bruce, David] Los Alamos Natl Lab, DOE Joint Genome Inst, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA; [D'haeseleer, Patrik; Zemla, Adam] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; [Wu, Martin] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Livermore, CA 94550 USA","Eisen, JA (reprint author), DOE Joint Genome Inst, Walnut Creek, CA 94598 USA.",jaeisen@ucdavis.edu,"; Hugenholtz, Philip/G-9608-2011; chain, patrick/B-9777-2013; Kyrpides, Nikos/A-6305-2014; Lapidus, Alla/I-4348-2013; Spring, Stefan/N-6933-2013","Ivanova, Natalia/0000-0002-5802-9485; Hugenholtz, Philip/0000-0001-5386-7925; Kyrpides, Nikos/0000-0002-6131-0462; Lapidus, Alla/0000-0003-0427-8731; Spring, Stefan/0000-0001-6247-0938; Eisen, Jonathan A./0000-0002-0159-2197; Chain, Patrick/0000-0003-3949-3634","US Department of Energy's Office of Science, Biological and Environmental Research Program; University of California, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory [DE-AC52-07NA27344]; Los Alamos National Laboratory [DE-AC02-06NA25396]; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation [1660]; DFG INST [599/1-1]","We thank the following people for assistance in aspects of the project including planning and discussions ( R.

It is widely assumed to induce adaptive reallocation of nutrients from reproduction to somatic maintenance, aiding survival of food shortages in nature(3-6). If this were the case, long life under dietary restriction and high fecundity under full feeding would be mutually exclusive, through competition for the same limiting nutrients. Here we report a test of this idea in which we identified the nutrients producing the responses of lifespan and fecundity to dietary restriction in Drosophila. Adding essential amino acids to the dietary restriction condition increased fecundity and decreased lifespan, similar to the effects of full feeding, with other nutrients having little or no effect. However, methionine alone was necessary and sufficient to increase fecundity as much as did full feeding, but without reducing lifespan. Reallocation of nutrients therefore does not explain the responses to dietary restriction. Lifespan was decreased by the addition of amino acids, with an interaction between methionine and other essential amino acids having a key role. Hence, an imbalance in dietary amino acids away from the ratio optimal for reproduction shortens lifespan during full feeding and limits fecundity during dietary restriction. Reduced activity of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor signalling pathway extends lifespan in diverse organisms(7), and we find that it also protects against the shortening of lifespan with full feeding. In other organisms, including mammals, it may be possible to obtain the benefits to lifespan of dietary restriction without incurring a reduction in fecundity, through a suitable balance of nutrients in the diet.","[Grandison, Richard C.; Piper, Matthew D.

Here, we show that a secreted semaphorin, Sema3F, is a negative regulator of spine development and synaptic structure. Mice with null mutations in genes encoding Sema3F, and its holoreceptor components neuropilin-2 (Npn-2, also known as Nrp2) and plexin A3 (PlexA3, also known as Plxna3), exhibit increased dentate gyrus (DG) granule cell (GC) and cortical layer V pyramidal neuron spine number and size, and also aberrant spine distribution. Moreover, Sema3F promotes loss of spines and excitatory synapses in dissociated neurons in vitro, and in Npn-2(-/-) brain slices cortical layer V and DG GCs exhibit increased mEPSC (miniature excitatory postsynaptic current) frequency. In contrast, a distinct Sema3A-Npn-1/PlexA4 signalling cascade controls basal dendritic arborization in layer V cortical neurons, but does not influence spine morphogenesis or distribution. These disparate effects of secreted semaphorins are reflected in the restricted dendritic localization of Npn-2 to apical dendrites and of Npn-1 (also known as Nrp1) to all dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons. Therefore, Sema3F signalling controls spine distribution along select dendritic processes, and distinct secreted semaphorin signalling events orchestrate CNS connectivity through the differential control of spine morphogenesis, synapse formation, and the elaboration of dendritic morphology.","[Tran, Tracy S.; Clem, Roger L.; Johnson, Dontais; Huganir, Richard L.; Ginty, David D.; Kolodkin, Alex L.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Solomon H Snyder Dept Neurosci, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Tran, Tracy S.; Clem, Roger L.; Johnson, Dontais; Huganir, Richard L.; Ginty, David D.; Kolodkin, Alex L.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Rubio, Maria E.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Physiol, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Rubio, Maria E.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Neurobiol, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Case, Lauren; Tessier-Lavigne, Marc] Stanford Univ, Grad Program Neurosci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Tessier-Lavigne, Marc] Genentech Inc, Div Res, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA","Ginty, DD (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Solomon H Snyder Dept Neurosci, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",dginty@jhmi.edu; kolodkin@jhmi.edu,,,"NRSA [F32 NS051003, R01 DC-006881]; NSF [DB1-0420580, P50 MH06883];  [R01 MH59199]","We thank M.

Strategies targeting EGFR T790M with irreversible inhibitors have had limited success and are associated with toxicity due to concurrent inhibition of wild-type EGFR(4,5). All current EGFR inhibitors possess a structurally related quinazoline-based core scaffold and were identified as ATP-competitive inhibitors of wild-type EGFR. Here we identify a covalent pyrimidine EGFR inhibitor by screening an irreversible kinase inhibitor library specifically against EGFR T790M. These agents are 30- to 100-fold more potent against EGFR T790M, and up to 100-fold less potent against wildtype EGFR, than quinazoline-based EGFR inhibitors in vitro. They are also effective in murine models of lung cancer driven by EGFR T790M. Co-crystallization studies reveal a structural basis for the increased potency and mutant selectivity of these agents. These mutant-selective irreversible EGFR kinase inhibitors may be clinically more effective and better tolerated than quinazoline-based inhibitors. Our findings demonstrate that functional pharmacological screens against clinically important mutant kinases represent a powerful strategy to identify new classes of mutant-selective kinase inhibitors.","[Zhou, Wenjun; Yun, Cai-Hong; Eck, Michael J.; Gray, Nathanael S.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Zhou, Wenjun; Yun, Cai-Hong; Eck, Michael J.; Gray, Nathanael S.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Biol Chem & Mol Pharmacol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Ercan, Dalia; Chen, Liang; Li, Danan; Capelletti, Marzia; Cortot, Alexis B.; Wong, Kwok-Kin; Jaenne, Pasi A.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Lowe Ctr Thorac Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Ercan, Dalia; Chen, Liang; Li, Danan; Capelletti, Marzia; Cortot, Alexis B.; Wong, Kwok-Kin; Jaenne, Pasi A.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Chirieac, Lucian; Padera, Robert] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Iacob, Roxana E.; Engen, John R.] Northeastern Univ, Barnett Inst Chem & Biol Anal, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Iacob, Roxana E.; Engen, John R.] Northeastern Univ, Dept Chem & Biol Chem, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Wong, Kwok-Kin; Jaenne, Pasi A.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Wong, Kwok-Kin; Jaenne, Pasi A.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Wong, Kwok-Kin; Jaenne, Pasi A.] Dana Farber Harvard Canc Ctr, Ludwig Ctr, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Gray, NS (reprint author), Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Biol, 44 Binney St, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",Nathanael_Gray@dfci.harvard.edu; pjanne@partners.org,,"wong, kwok kin/0000-0001-6323-235X","National Institutes of Health [RO1CA11446, R01CA135257, R01CA080942, R01CA130876-02, R01CA116020, R01AG2400401, R01 CA122794, R01GM070590]; National Cancer Institute Lung SPORE [P50CA090578]; Cecily and Robert Harris Foundation; Uniting Against Lung Cancer; Flight Attendant Medical Research Institute; Hazel and Samuel Bellin Research Fund; Damon Runyon Foundation Cancer Innovation Award","This study is supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health RO1CA11446 ( P.

In particular, significant advances in label-free methods have been reported(11-17). Yet detection of DNA molecules at concentrations below the femtomolar level requires amplified detection schemes(1,8). Here we report a unique nanomechanical response of hybridized DNA and RNA molecules that serves as an intrinsic molecular label. Nanomechanical measurements on a microarray surface have sufficient background signal rejection to allow direct detection and counting of hybridized molecules. The digital response of the sensor provides a large dynamic range that is critical for gene expression profiling. We have measured differential expressions of microRNAs in tumour samples; such measurements have been shown to help discriminate between the tissue origins of metastatic tumours(18). Two hundred picograms of total RNA is found to be sufficient for this analysis. In addition, the limit of detection in pure samples is found to be one attomolar. These results suggest that nanomechanical read-out of microarrays promises attomolar-level sensitivity and large dynamic range for the analysis of gene expression, while eliminating biochemical manipulations, amplification and labelling.","[Husale, Sudhir; Sahin, Ozgur] Harvard Univ, Rowland Inst Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Persson, Henrik H.

Whereas progress has been made in designing proteins that mimic native proteins structurally(1-3), it is more difficult to design functional proteins(4-8). In comparison to recent successes in designing non-metalloproteins(4,6,7,9,10), it is even more challenging to rationally design metalloproteins that reproduce both the structure and function of native metalloenzymes(5,8,11-20). This is because protein metal-binding sites are much more varied than non-metal-containing sites, in terms of different metal ion oxidation states, preferred geometry and metal ion ligand donor sets. Because of their variability, it has been difficult to predict metal-binding site properties in silico, as many of the parameters, such as force fields, are ill-defined. Therefore, the successful design of a structural and functional metalloprotein would greatly advance the field of protein design and our understanding of enzymes. Here we report a successful, rational design of a structural and functional model of a metalloprotein, nitric oxide reductase (NOR), by introducing three histidines and one glutamate, predicted as ligands in the active site of NOR, into the distal pocket of myoglobin. A crystal structure of the designed protein confirms that the minimized computer model contains a haem/non-haem Fe(B) centre that is remarkably similar to that in the crystal structure. This designed protein also exhibits NO reduction activity, and so models both the structure and function of NOR, offering insight that the active site glutamate is required for both iron binding and activity. These results show that structural and functional metalloproteins can be rationally designed in silico.","[Yeung, Natasha; Lin, Ying-Wu; Zhao, Xuan; Russell, Brandy S.; Lei, Lanyu; Lu, Yi] Univ Illinois, Dept Chem, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Gao, Yi-Gui] Univ Illinois, George L Clark Xray Facil, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Gao, Yi-Gui] Univ Illinois, Mat Lab 3M, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Miner, Kyle D.; Lu, Yi] Univ Illinois, Dept Biochem, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Robinson, Howard] Brookhaven Natl Lab, Dept Biol, Upton, NY 11973 USA","Lu, Y (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Dept Chem, 1209 W Calif St, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",yi-lu@illinois.edu,"Lu, Yi/B-5461-2010","Lu, Yi/0000-0003-1221-6709; Miner, Kyle/0000-0001-9562-2459",US National Institutes of Health [GM062211],"We thank M.

Geological records from several sites indicate that local sea levels during the last interglacial were higher than today, but because local sea levels differ from global sea level, accurately reconstructing past global sea level requires an integrated analysis of globally distributed data sets. Here we present an extensive compilation of local sea level indicators and a statistical approach for estimating global sea level, local sea levels, ice sheet volumes and their associated uncertainties. We find a 95% probability that global sea level peaked at least 6.6 m higher than today during the last interglacial; it is likely (67% probability) to have exceeded 8.0 m but is unlikely (33% probability) to have exceeded 9.4 m. When global sea level was close to its current level (>=-10 m), the millennial average rate of global sea level rise is very likely to have exceeded 5.6 m kyr(-1) but is unlikely to have exceeded 9.2 m kyr(-1). Our analysis extends previous last interglacial sea level studies by integrating literature observations within a probabilistic framework that accounts for the physics of sea level change.

Although many associations between sequence variants and human traits have been discovered through genome-wide associations, the impact of parental origin has largely been ignored. Here we show that for 38,167 Icelanders genotyped using single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP) chips, the parental origin of most alleles can be determined. For this we used a combination of genealogy and long-range phasing. We then focused on SNPs that associate with diseases and are within 500 kilobases of known imprinted genes. Seven independent SNP associations were examined. Five-one with breast cancer, one with basal-cell carcinoma and three with type 2 diabetes-have parental-origin-specific associations. These variants are located in two genomic regions, 11p15 and 7q32, each harbouring a cluster of imprinted genes. Furthermore, we observed a novel association between the SNP rs2334499 at 11p15 and type 2 diabetes. Here the allele that confers risk when paternally inherited is protective when maternally transmitted. We identified a differentially methylated CTCF-binding site at 11p15 and demonstrated correlation of rs2334499 with decreased methylation of that site.","[Kong, Augustine; Steinthorsdottir, Valgerdur; Masson, Gisli; Thorleifsson, Gudmar; Sulem, Patrick; Besenbacher, Soren; Jonasdottir, Aslaug; Sigurdsson, Asgeir; Jonasdottir, Adalbjorg; Frigge, Michael L.; Gylfason, Arnaldur; Olason, Pall I.; Gudjonsson, Sigurjon A.; Sverrisson, Sverrir; Stacey, Simon N.; Gudbjartsson, Daniel F.; Thorsteinsdottir, Unnur; Stefansson, Kari] deCODE Genet, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Sigurgeirsson, Bardur; Olafsson, Jon H.] Landspitali Univ Hosp, Dept Dermatol, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Benediktsdottir, Kristrun R.] Landspitali Univ Hosp, Dept Pathol, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Sigurdsson, Helgi; Johannsson, Oskar Th.] Landspitali Univ Hosp, Dept Oncol, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Jonsson, Thorvaldur] Landspitali Univ Hosp, Dept Surg, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Benediktsson, Rafn; Hreidarsson, Astradur B.; Sigurdsson, Gunnar] Landspitali Univ Hosp, Dept Endocrinol & Metab, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Ferguson-Smith, Anne C.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Physiol Dev & Neurosci, Cambridge CB2 3EG, England; [Thorsteinsdottir, Unnur; Stefansson, Kari] Univ Iceland, Fac Med, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland","Kong, A (reprint author), deCODE Genet, Sturlugata 8, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland.",kong@decode.is; kstefans@decode.is,"; Abecasis, Goncalo/B-7840-2010; Altshuler, David/A-4476-2009; Ferguson-Smith, Anne/G-7534-2011; Elliott, Amanda/G-5120-2012; Rudan, Igor/I-1467-2012; Boehm, Bernhard/F-8750-2015; Meitinger, Thomas/O-1318-2015; Walters, G.

Two key events at the cell membrane-extracellular glucose sensing and uptake-initiate the budding yeast's growth on glucose. However, conventional growth models focus almost exclusively on glucose uptake. Here we present results from growth-rate experiments that cannot be explained by focusing on glucose uptake alone. By imposing a glucose uptake rate independent of the sensed extracellular glucose level, we show that despite increasing both the sensed glucose concentration and uptake rate, the cell's growth rate can decrease or even approach zero. We resolve this puzzle by showing that the interaction between glucose perception and import, not their individual actions, determines the central features of growth, and characterize this interaction using a quantitative model. Disrupting this interaction by knocking out two key glucose sensors significantly changes the cell's growth rate, yet uptake rates are unchanged. This is due to a decrease in burden that glucose perception places on the cells. Our work shows that glucose perception and import are separate and pivotal modules of yeast growth, the interaction of which can be precisely tuned and measured.","[Youk, Hyun; van Oudenaarden, Alexander] MIT, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [van Oudenaarden, Alexander] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","van Oudenaarden, A (reprint author), MIT, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",avano@mit.edu,"Youk, Hyun/E-2661-2016","Youk, Hyun/0000-0003-1687-5760",National Institutes of Health (NIH); National Science Foundation (NSF); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada's (NSERC),"We thank E.

Crucial to the reaction is the conformational transition of the transporters between outward and inward facing states, in which the substrate binding sites are accessible from the extracellular space and the cytoplasm, respectively. Here we describe the crystal structure of a double cysteine mutant of a glutamate transporter homologue from Pyrococcus horikoshii, Glt(Ph), which is trapped in the inward facing state by cysteine crosslinking. Together with the previously determined crystal structures of Glt(Ph) in the outward facing state, the structure of the crosslinked mutant allows us to propose a molecular mechanism by which Glt(Ph) and, by analogy, mammalian glutamate transporters mediate sodium-coupled substrate uptake.","[Reyes, Nicolas; Ginter, Christopher; Boudker, Olga] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Physiol & Biophys, New York, NY 10065 USA","Boudker, O (reprint author), Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Physiol & Biophys, 1300 York Ave,Box 75, New York, NY 10065 USA.",olb2003@med.cornell.edu,,"Reyes, Nicolas/0000-0001-6618-8307",National Institute of Health; Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund,We thank D.
