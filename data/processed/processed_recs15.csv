The challenge for crystallographers, however, remains the growing of a diffracting crystal. Here we report the 4.5- angstrom resolution structure of a 22-MDa macromolecular assembly, the capsid of the infectious epsilon15 ( epsilon 15) particle, by single-particle electron cryomicroscopy. From this density map we constructed a complete backbone trace of its major capsid protein, gene product 7 ( gp7). The structure reveals a similar protein architecture to that of other tailed double- stranded DNA viruses, even in the absence of detectable sequence similarity(3,4). However, the connectivity of the secondary structure elements ( topology) in gp7 is unique. Protruding densities are observed around the two- fold axes that cannot be accounted for by gp7. A subsequent proteomic analysis of the whole virus identifies these densities as gp10, a 12- kDa protein. Its structure, location and high binding affinity to the capsid indicate that the gp10 dimer functions as a molecular staple between neighbouring capsomeres to ensure the particle's stability. Beyond epsilon 15, this method potentially offers a new approach for modelling the backbone conformations of the protein subunits in other macromolecular assemblies at near- native solution states.","[Baker, Matthew L.; Jakana, Joanita; Chiu, Wah] Baylor Coll Med, Natl Ctr Macromol Imaging, Verna & Marrs Mclean Dept Biochem, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Jiang, Wen] Purdue Univ, Markey Ctr Struct Biol, Dept Biol Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Weigele, Peter R.; King, Jonathan] MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Chiu, W (reprint author), Baylor Coll Med, Natl Ctr Macromol Imaging, Verna & Marrs Mclean Dept Biochem, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",jiang12@purdue.edu; wah@bcm.edu,,,,,,35,150,157,1,13,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,28-Feb,2008,451,7182,,,,,1130,U12,,10.1038/nature06665,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,266RB,WOS:000253453600047,18305544.0,No,,,11/20/17,wah,chiu,male,0.95,19,QgGaAdsAAAAJ,23821

The plastid is surrounded by four membranes, is pigmented by chlorophyll a, and uses the codon UGA to encode tryptophan in the psbA gene. This genetic feature has been found only in coccidian apicoplasts and various mitochondria. The UGA-Trp codon and phylogenies of plastid and nuclear ribosomal RNA genes indicate that the organism is the closest known photosynthetic relative to apicomplexan parasites and that its plastid shares an origin with the apicoplasts.

This tandem system serves as a nutrient sensor to couple systemic metabolic status to cellular regulation of signal transduction, transcription, and protein degradation. Here we show that O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) harbours a previously unrecognized type of phosphoinositide-binding domain. After induction with insulin, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate recruits OGT from the nucleus to the plasma membrane, where the enzyme catalyses dynamic modification of the insulin signalling pathway by O-GlcNAc. This results in the alteration in phosphorylation of key signalling molecules and the attenuation of insulin signal transduction. Hepatic overexpression of OGT impairs the expression of insulin-responsive genes and causes insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia. These findings identify a molecular mechanism by which nutritional cues regulate insulin signalling through O-GlcNAc, and underscore the contribution of this modification to the aetiology of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.","[Yang, Xiaoyong; Havstad, Joyce C.; Evans, Ronald M.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Howard Hughes Med Inst, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Yang, Xiaoyong; Havstad, Joyce C.; Evans, Ronald M.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Gene Express Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Ongusaha, Pat P.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Cutaneous Biol Res Ctr, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Ongusaha, Pat P.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Miles, Philip D.; Olefsky, Jerrold M.; Field, Seth J.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Zhang, Fengxue; Kudlow, Jeffrey E.] Univ Alabama, Dept Med, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; [So, W.

This has been interpreted as hydrogen atoms escaping from the planet's exosphere(1,3), possibly undergoing hydrodynamic blow-off(4), and being accelerated by stellar radiation pressure. Energetic neutral atoms around Solar System planets have been observed to form from charge exchange between solar wind protons and neutral hydrogen from the planetary exospheres(5-7), however, and this process also should occur around extrasolar planets. Here we show that the measured transit-associated Ly alpha absorption can be explained by the interaction between the exosphere of HD 209458b and the stellar wind, and that radiation pressure alone cannot explain the observations. As the stellar wind protons are the source of the observed energetic neutral atoms, this provides a way of probing stellar wind conditions, and our model suggests a slow and hot stellar wind near HD 209458b at the time of the observations.","[Holmstroem, M.; Ekenbaeck, A.] Swedish Inst Space Phys, SE-98128 Kiruna, Sweden; [Selsis, F.] Univ Bordeaux 1, Astrophys Lab, CNRS, F-33270 Floirac, France; [Selsis, F.] Univ Lyon 1, Ecole Normale Super Lyon, CNRS, Ctr Rech Astrophys Lyon, F-69007 Lyon, France; [Penz, T.] INAF Osserv Astron Palermo, I-90134 Palermo, Italy; [Lammer, H.] Austrian Acad Sci, Inst Space Res, A-8042 Graz, Austria; [Wurz, P.] Univ Bern, Inst Phys, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland","Holmstrom, M (reprint author), Swedish Inst Space Phys, POB 812, SE-98128 Kiruna, Sweden.",matsh@irf.se,,,,,,18,83,84,0,4,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,21-Feb,2008,451,7181,,,,,970,972,,10.1038/nature06600,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,264TK,WOS:000253313100043,18288189.0,No,,,11/20/17,p.,wurz,na,na,na,na,na

Understanding how surface water flow could have produced the observed morphology is fundamental to understanding the history of water on Mars. To date, morphological studies have provided only minimum time estimates for the longevity of martian hydrologic events, which range from decades to millions of years(4-7). Here we use sand flume studies to show that the distinct morphology of martian stepped (terraced) deltas(8-11) could only have originated from a single basin- filling event on a timescale of tens of years. Stepped deltas therefore provide a minimum and maximum constraint on the duration and magnitude of some surface flows on Mars. We estimate that the amount of water required to fill the basin and deposit the delta is comparable to the amount of water discharged by large terrestrial rivers, such as the Mississippi. The massive discharge, short timescale, and the associated short canyon lengths favour the hypothesis that stepped fans are terraced delta deposits draped over an alluvial fan and formed by water released suddenly from subsurface storage.","[Kraal, Erin R.; van Dijk, Maurits; Postma, George; Kleinhans, Maarten G.] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands","Kraal, ER (reprint author), Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Geosci, 4044 Derring Hall 0420, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",ekraal@vt.edu,,"Kleinhans, Maarten/0000-0002-9484-1673",,,,25,50,50,0,14,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,21-Feb,2008,451,7181,,,,,973,U2,,10.1038/nature06615,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,264TK,WOS:000253313100044,18288190.0,No,,,11/20/17,maarten g.,kleinhans,na,na,na,na,na

Rubber elasticity is a property of macromolecules that are either covalently cross- linked(1,2) or connected in a network by physical associations such as small glassy or crystalline domains(3-5), ionic aggregates(6) or multiple hydrogen bonds(7-16). Covalent cross-links or strong physical associations prevent flow and creep. Here we design and synthesize molecules that associate together to form both chains and cross-links via hydrogen bonds. The system shows recoverable extensibility up to several hundred per cent and little creep under load. In striking contrast to conventional cross-linked or thermoreversible rubbers made of macromolecules, these systems, when broken or cut, can be simply repaired by bringing together fractured surfaces to self- heal at room temperature. Repaired samples recuperate their enormous extensibility. The process of breaking and healing can be repeated many times. These materials can be easily processed, re- used and recycled. Their unique self-repairing properties, the simplicity of their synthesis, their availability from renewable resources and the low cost of raw ingredients (fatty acids and urea) bode well for future applications.","[Cordier, Philippe; Tournilhac, Francois; Soulie-Ziakovic, Corinne; Leibler, Ludwik] Ecole Super Phys & Chim Ind Ville Paris, CNRS ESPCI, UMR 7167, F-75005 Paris, France","Leibler, L (reprint author), Ecole Super Phys & Chim Ind Ville Paris, CNRS ESPCI, UMR 7167, 10 Rue Vauquelin, F-75005 Paris, France.",ludwik.leibler@espci.fr,,,,,,30,1115,1135,143,1378,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,21-Feb,2008,451,7181,,,,,977,980,,10.1038/nature06669,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,264TK,WOS:000253313100045,18288191.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,ludwik,leibler,male,1,1,na,na

But whether and how subducting plates penetrate into the lower mantle is the subject of continuing debate, which has substantial implications for the chemical and thermal evolution of the mantle(1,2). Here we identify lower-mantle slab penetration events by comparing Cenozoic plate motions at the Earth's main subduction zones(3) with motions predicted by fully dynamic models of the upper- mantle phase of subduction, driven solely by downgoing plate density(4). Whereas subduction of older, intrinsically denser, lithosphere occurs at rates consistent with the model, younger lithosphere (of ages less than about 60 Myr) often subducts up to two times faster, while trench motions are very low. We conclude that the most likely explanation is that older lithosphere, subducting under significant trench retreat, tends to lie down flat above the transition to the high- viscosity lower mantle, whereas younger lithosphere, which is less able to drive trench retreat and deforms more readily, buckles and thickens. Slab thickening enhances buoyancy (volume times density) and thereby Stokes sinking velocity, thus facilitating fast lowermantle penetration. Such an interpretation is consistent with seismic images of the distribution of subducted material in upper and lower mantle(5,6). Thus we identify a direct expression of time- dependent flow between the upper and lower mantle.","[Goes, Saskia] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Earth Sci & Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Capitanio, Fabio A.; Morra, Gabriele] ETH, Inst Geophys, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland","Goes, S (reprint author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Earth Sci & Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England.",s.goes@imperial.ac.uk,"Capitanio, Fabio/E-8774-2010; Morra, Gabriele/E-4311-2013","Morra, Gabriele/0000-0002-0787-6107; Capitanio, Fabio/0000-0003-2131-8723",,,,30,76,76,1,26,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,21-Feb,2008,451,7181,,,,,981,984,,10.1038/nature06691,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,264TK,WOS:000253313100046,18288192.0,No,,,11/20/17,gabriele,morra,male,0.81,250,na,na

Despite repeated emphasis on the 'wing-stroke' as a necessary avenue of investigation for addressing the evolution of flight(1-4), no empirical data exist on wing-stroke dynamics in an experimental evolutionary context. Here we present the first comparison of wing-stroke kinematics of the primary locomotor modes (descending flight and incline flap- running) that lead to level- flapping flight in juvenile ground birds throughout development (Fig. 1). We offer results that are contrary both to popular perception and inferences from other studies(5-7). Starting shortly after hatching and continuing through adulthood, ground birds use a wing- stroke confined to a narrow range of less than 20 degrees, when referenced to gravity, that directs aerodynamic forces about 40 degrees above horizontal, permitting a 180 degrees range in the direction of travel. Based on our results, we put forth an ontogenetic- transitional wing hypothesis that posits that the incremental adaptive stages leading to the evolution of avian flight correspond behaviourally and morphologically to transitional stages observed in ontogenetic forms.","[Dial, Kenneth P.; Jackson, Brandon E.; Segre, Paolo] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Flight Lab, Missoula, MT 59812 USA","Dial, KP (reprint author), Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Flight Lab, 32 Campus Dr, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",kdial@mso.umt.edu,"Segre, Paolo/A-7865-2011; Jackson, Brandon/H-3869-2012",,,,,28,45,46,2,83,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Feb,2008,451,7181,,,,,985,U3,,10.1038/nature06517,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,264TK,WOS:000253313100047,18216784.0,No,,,11/20/17,paolo,segre,na,na,na,na,na

Their emergence is thought to be driven largely by socio- economic, environmental and ecological factors(1-9), but no comparative study has explicitly analysed these linkages to understand global temporal and spatial patterns of EIDs. Here we analyse a database of 335 EID 'events' (origins of EIDs) between 1940 and 2004, and demonstrate non-random global patterns. EID events have risen significantly over time after controlling for reporting bias, with their peak incidence (in the 1980s) concomitant with the HIV pandemic. EID events are dominated by zoonoses (60.3% of EIDs): the majority of these (71.8%) originate in wildlife (for example, severe acute respiratory virus, Ebola virus), and are increasing significantly over time. We find that 54.3% of EID events are caused by bacteria or rickettsia, reflecting a large number of drug- resistant microbes in our database. Our results confirm that EID origins are significantly correlated with socio- economic, environmental and ecological factors, and provide a basis for identifying regions where new EIDs are most likely to originate (emerging disease 'hotspots'). They also reveal a substantial risk of wildlife zoonotic and vector-borne EIDs originating at lower latitudes where reporting effort is low. We conclude that global resources to counter disease emergence are poorly allocated, with the majority of the scientific and surveillance effort focused on countries from where the next important EID is least likely to originate.","[Patel, Nikkita G.; Daszak, Peter] Wildlife Trust, Consortium Conservat Med, Beijing 100011, Peoples R China; [Jones, Kate E.] Zool Soc London, Inst Zool, London NW1 4RY, England; [Levy, Marc A.; Storeygard, Adam; Balk, Deborah] Columbia Univ, Ctr Int Earth Sci Informat Network, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Gittleman, John L.] Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Daszak, P (reprint author), Wildlife Trust, Consortium Conservat Med, 460 W 34th St,17th Floor, Beijing 100011, Peoples R China.",daszak@conservationmedicine.org,"Levy, Marc/F-6183-2010; Jones, Kate/G-4768-2010; Storeygard, Adam/H-2633-2017","Jones, Kate/0000-0001-5231-3293; Patel, Nikkita/0000-0001-6300-6731; Levy, Marc/0000-0002-1111-2222",FIC NIH HHS [R01 TW005869]; NIAID NIH HHS [R01 AI079231]; NICHD NIH HHS [T32 HD007338],,,29,1845,1934,92,1559,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Feb,2008,451,7181,,,,,990,U4,,10.1038/nature06536,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,264TK,WOS:000253313100048,18288193.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,peter,daszak,na,na,na,na,na

Here we combine genome- wide polymorphism data from PCR- based exon resequencing, comparative genomic data across mammalian species, and protein structure predictions to estimate the number of functionally consequential singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) carried by each of 15 African American (AA) and 20 European American (EA) individuals. We find that AAs show significantly higher levels of nucleotide heterozygosity than do EAs for all categories of functional SNPs considered, including synonymous, non- synonymous, predicted 'benign', predicted 'possibly damaging' and predicted 'probably damaging' SNPs. This result is wholly consistent with previous work showing higher overall levels of nucleotide variation in African populations than in Europeans(4). EA individuals, in contrast, have significantly more genotypes homozygous for the derived allele at synonymous and non- synonymous SNPs and for the damaging allele at ` probably damaging' SNPs than AAs do. For SNPs segregating only in one population or the other, the proportion of non-synonymous SNPs is significantly higher in the EA sample (55.4%) than in the AA sample (47.0%; P < 2.33 X 10(-37)). We observe a similar proportional excess of SNPs that are inferred to be 'probably damaging' (15.9% in EA; 12.1% in AA; P < 3.33 X 10(-11)). Using extensive simulations, we show that this excess proportion of segregating damaging alleles in Europeans is probably a consequence of a bottleneck that Europeans experienced at about the time of the migration out of Africa.","[Lohmueller, Kirk E.; Indap, Amit R.; Boyko, Adam R.; Hernandez, Ryan D.; Bustamante, Carlos D.] Cornell Univ, Dept Biol Stat & Computat Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Lohmueller, Kirk E.; Boyko, Adam R.; Clark, Andrew G.] Cornell Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Schmidt, Steffen] Max Planck Inst Dev Biol, Dept Biochem, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Hubisz, Melissa J.] Univ Chicago, Dept Human Genet, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Sninsky, John J.; White, Thomas J.] Celera Diagnost, Alameda, CA 94592 USA; [Sunyaev, Shamil R.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Genet, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Sunyaev, Shamil R.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Nielsen, Rasmus] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Comparat Genom, Dept Biol, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark","Bustamante, CD (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Dept Biol Stat & Computat Biol, Biotechnol Bldg, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",cdb28@cornell.edu,"Nielsen, Rasmus/D-4405-2009; Pepper, John/O-1662-2013","Nielsen, Rasmus/0000-0003-0513-6591; Pepper, John/0000-0001-9888-0437","NHGRI NIH HHS [R01 HG003229, R01 HG003229-03]; NHLBI NIH HHS [R01 HL072904]; NIGMS NIH HHS [P50 GM065509, P50 GM065509-070006]",,,30,212,216,1,16,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Feb,2008,451,7181,,,,,994,U5,,10.1038/nature06611,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,264TK,WOS:000253313100049,18288194.0,No,,,11/20/17,carlos d.,bustamante,male,1,2,fPWa8HmjxJkC,26718

Here we report the analysis of high-quality genotypes at 525,910 single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) and 396 copy-number-variable loci in a worldwide sample of 29 populations. Analysis of SNP genotypes yields strongly supported fine-scale inferences about population structure. Increasing linkage disequilibrium is observed with increasing geographic distance from Africa, as expected under a serial founder effect for the out-of-Africa spread of human populations. New approaches for haplotype analysis produce inferences about population structure that complement results based on unphased SNPs. Despite a difference from SNPs in the frequency spectrum of the copy-number variants (CNVs) detected-including a comparatively large number of CNVs in previously unexamined populations from Oceania and the Americas-the global distribution of CNVs largely accords with population structure analyses for SNP data sets of similar size.

The adult neural stem cell pool is composed of orphan nuclear receptor TLX- positive cells(7). Here, using genetic approaches in mice, we demonstrate that TLX ( also called NR2E1) regulates adult neural stem cell proliferation in a cell- autonomous manner by controlling a defined genetic network implicated in cell proliferation and growth. Consequently, specific removal of TLX from the adult mouse brain through inducible recombination results in a significant reduction of stem cell proliferation and a marked decrement in spatial learning. In contrast, the resulting suppression of adult neurogenesis does not affect contextual fear conditioning, locomotion or diurnal rhythmic activities, indicating a more selective contribution of newly generated neurons to specific cognitive functions.","[Zhang, Chun-Li; Evans, Ronald M.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Howard Hughes Med Inst, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Zhang, Chun-Li; Zou, Yuhua; He, Weimin; Evans, Ronald M.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Gene Express Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Gage, Fred H.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Genet Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Evans, RM (reprint author), Salk Inst Biol Studies, Howard Hughes Med Inst, 10010 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",gage@salk.edu; evans@salk.edu,,,,,,31,339,355,2,24,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Feb,2008,451,7181,,,,,1004,U7,,10.1038/nature06562,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,264TK,WOS:000253313100051,18235445.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,ronald m.,evans,na,na,na,na,na

Hypoxia stimulates the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF) and other angiogenic factors, leading to neovascularization and protection against ischaemic injury(1). Here we show that the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1 alpha ( peroxisome- proliferator- activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1 alpha), a potent metabolic sensor and regulator(2), is induced by a lack of nutrients and oxygen, and PGC-1 alpha powerfully regulates VEGF expression and angiogenesis in cultured muscle cells and skeletal muscle in vivo. PGC-1 alpha(-/-) mice show a striking failure to reconstitute blood flow in a normal manner to the limb after an ischaemic insult, whereas transgenic expression of PGC-1 alpha in skeletal muscle is protective. Surprisingly, the induction of VEGF by PGC-1 alpha does not involve the canonical hypoxia response pathway and hypoxia inducible factor ( HIF). Instead, PGC-1 alpha coactivates the orphan nuclear receptor ERR-alpha ( oestrogen- related receptor- alpha) on conserved binding sites found in the promoter and in a cluster within the first intron of the VEGF gene. Thus, PGC-1 alpha and ERR-alpha, major regulators of mitochondrial function in response to exercise and other stimuli, also control a novel angiogenic pathway that delivers needed oxygen and substrates. PGC-1 alpha may provide a novel therapeutic target for treating ischaemic diseases.","[Arany, Zoltan; Ma, Yanhong; Ruas, Jorge L.; Bommi-Reddy, Archana; Girnun, Geoffrey; Cooper, Marcus; Laznik, Dina; Chinsomboon, Jessica; Spiegelman, Bruce M.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Arany, Zoltan; Ma, Yanhong; Ruas, Jorge L.; Bommi-Reddy, Archana; Girnun, Geoffrey; Cooper, Marcus; Laznik, Dina; Chinsomboon, Jessica; Spiegelman, Bruce M.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Arany, Zoltan; Foo, Shi-Yin; Rosenzweig, Anthony] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Cardiovasc Inst, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Arany, Zoltan; Foo, Shi-Yin; Rosenzweig, Anthony] Harvard Stem Cell Inst, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Rangwala, Shamina M.] Novartis Inst Biomed Res Diabet & Metab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Baek, Kwan Hyuck] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Vasc Biol Program, Dept Surg,Childrens Hosp, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Arany, Z (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, 44 Binney St, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",zarany1@partners.org; bruce_spiegelman@dfci.harvard.edu,,"Ruas, Jorge/0000-0002-1110-2606","NIDDK NIH HHS [P30 DK040561, P30 DK040561-12, R01 DK054477]",,,23,520,552,3,61,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Feb,2008,451,7181,,,,,1008,U8,,10.1038/nature06613,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,264TK,WOS:000253313100052,18288196.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,bruce m.,spiegelman,na,na,na,na,na

Phosphatidylinositol-4,5- bisphosphate ( PtdIns4,5P(2)), the central component in the phosphoinositide signalling circuitry, is generated primarily by type I phosphatidylinositol 4- phosphate 5- kinases ( PIPKI alpha, PIPKI beta and PIPKI gamma)(1). In addition to functions in the cytosol, phosphoinositides are present in the nucleus(2,3), where they modulate several functions(4-6); however, the mechanism by which they directly regulate nuclear functions remains unknown. PIPKIs regulate cellular functions through interactions with protein partners, often PtdIns4,5P(2) effectors, that target PIPKIs to discrete subcellular compartments, resulting in the spatial and temporal generation of PtdIns4,5P(2) required for the regulation of specific signalling pathways(1,7). Therefore, to determine roles for nuclear PtdIns4,5P(2) we set out to identify proteins that interacted with the nuclear PIPK, PIPKI alpha. Here we show that PIPKI alpha co- localizes at nuclear speckles and interacts with a newly identified non- canonical poly( A) polymerase, which we have termed Star- PAP ( nuclear speckle targeted PIPKIa regulated- poly( A) polymerase) and that the activity of Star- PAP can be specifically regulated by PtdIns4,5P(2). Star- PAP and PIPKIa function together in a complex to control the expression of select mRNAs, including the transcript encoding the key cytoprotective enzyme haem oxygenase- 1 ( refs 8, 9) and other oxidative stress response genes by regulating the 3 '-end formation of their mRNAs. Taken together, the data demonstrate a model by which phosphoinositide signalling works in tandem with complement pathways to regulate the activity of Star- PAP and the subsequent biosynthesis of its target mRNA. The results reveal a mechanism for the integration of nuclear phosphoinositide signals and a method for regulating gene expression.","[Mellman, David L.; Gonzales, Michael L.; Anderson, Richard A.] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Med, Mol & Cellular Biol Program, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Song, Chunhua; Barlow, Christy A.; Anderson, Richard A.] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Wang, Ping; Kendziorski, Christina] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Med, Dept Biostat & Med Informat, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Anderson, RA (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Sch Med, Mol & Cellular Biol Program, 1300 Univ Ave, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",raanders@wisc.edu,,"Anderson, Richard/0000-0001-6265-8359; Barlow, Christy/0000-0002-1239-3767","NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM051968, R01 GM114386]",,,32,119,127,0,9,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Feb,2008,451,7181,,,,,1013,U9,,10.1038/nature06666,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,264TK,WOS:000253313100053,18288197.0,No,,,11/20/17,richard a.,anderson,na,na,na,na,na

Bacterial RecA family proteins promote the formation and branch migration of HJs in vitro by catalysing a reciprocal DNA- strand exchange reaction between two duplex DNA molecules, one of which contains a single- stranded DNA region that is essential for initial nucleoprotein filament formation(5). This activity has been reported only for prokaryotic RecA family recombinases(5), although eukaryotic homologues are also essential for HJ production in vivo(6,7). Here we show that fission yeast ( Rhp51) and human ( hRad51) RecA homologues promote duplex - duplex DNA- strand exchange in vitro. As with RecA, a HJ is formed between the two duplex DNA molecules, and reciprocal strand exchange proceeds through branch migration of the HJ. In contrast to RecA, however, strand exchange mediated by eukaryotic recombinases proceeds in the 3 '-->5 ' direction relative to the single- stranded DNA region of the substrate DNA. The opposite polarity of Rhp51 makes it especially suitable for the repair of DNA double- strand breaks, whose repair is initiated at the processed ends of breaks that have protruding 3 ' termini(1,2).","[Murayama, Yasuto; Kurokawa, Yumiko; Iwasaki, Hiroshi] Yokohama City Univ, Div Mol & Cellular Biol, Int Grad Sch Arts & Sci, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Mayanagi, Kouta] Nagahama Inst Biosci & Technol, Dept Biosci, Shiga 5260829, Japan; [Mayanagi, Kouta] JST, BIRD, Shiga 5260829, Japan","Iwasaki, H (reprint author), Yokohama City Univ, Div Mol & Cellular Biol, Int Grad Sch Arts & Sci, 1-7-29 Suehirocho, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan.",iwasaki@tsurumi.yokohama-cu.ac.jp,,,,,,33,32,32,0,6,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,21-Feb,2008,451,7181,,,,,1018,U10,,10.1038/nature06609,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,264TK,WOS:000253313100054,18256600.0,No,,,11/20/17,hiroshi,iwasaki,male,1,19,na,na

In Arabidopsis, how MPK3/ 6modulates distinct outputs in diverse signal transduction pathways remains elusive. By combining systematic cellular and genetic screens, here we uncover a previously unexpected MKK9 - MPK3/ MPK6 cascade promoting ethylene- insensitive 3 ( EIN3)- mediated transcription in ethylene signalling. The mkk9 mutant exhibits a broad spectrum of moderate ethylene- insensitive phenotypes, and translocated MKK9 governs nuclear signalling downstream of receptors. Breaking a linear model and conventional MAPK signalling, ethylene inactivates the negative regulator constitutive triple response 1 ( CTR1, a Raf- like MAPK kinase kinase ( MAPKKK)) to activate the positive MKK9 - MPK3/ 6 cascade. The bifurcate and antagonistic CTR1 and MKK9 pathways are both critical in determining ethylene- signalling specificity through two MAPK phosphorylation sites with opposite effects on EIN3 stability. The results suggest a new paradigm for linking intertwined MAPK cascades to control quantitative responses and specificity in signalling networks.","[Yoo, Sang-Dong; Cho, Young-Hee; Tena, Guillaume; Xiong, Yan; Sheen, Jen] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Mol Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Yoo, Sang-Dong; Cho, Young-Hee; Tena, Guillaume; Xiong, Yan; Sheen, Jen] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02114 USA","Sheen, J (reprint author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Mol Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",yoo@molbio.mgh.harvard.edu; sheen@molbio.mgh.harvard.edu,,"Tena, Guillaume/0000-0001-8652-905X","NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM070567, R01 GM060493]",,,50,268,298,2,49,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Feb,2008,451,7180,,,,,789,U1,,10.1038/nature06543,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,263BA,WOS:000253191400034,18273012.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,jen,sheen,female,0.99,1233,na,na

CTCF is dispensable for cohesin loading onto DNA, but is needed to enrich cohesin at specific binding sites. Cohesin enables CTCF to insulate promoters from distant enhancers and controls transcription at the H19/IGF2 ( insulin- like growth factor 2) locus. This role of cohesin seems to be independent of its role in cohesion.

Although there is general agreement that the exploding star is a white dwarf in a binary system, the exact configuration and trigger of the explosion is unclear(4), which could hamper their use for precision cosmology. Two families of progenitor models have been proposed. In the first, a white dwarf accretes material from a companion until it exceeds the Chandrasekhar mass, collapses and explodes(5,6). Alternatively, two white dwarfs merge, again causing catastrophic collapse and an explosion(7,8). It has hitherto been impossible to determine if either model is correct.

Therefore, the determination of where atoms are and what atoms do is a cornerstone of modern solid- state physics. However, experimental observations of atomic displacements measured as a function of temperature are very rare, because those displacements are, in almost all cases, exceedingly small(3-5). Here we show, using a combination of diffraction techniques, that the hexagonal manganites RMnO3 ( where R is a rare- earth element) undergo an isostructural transition with exceptionally large atomic displacements: two orders of magnitude larger than those seen in any other magnetic material, resulting in an unusually strong magneto- elastic coupling. We follow the exact atomic displacements of all the atoms in the unit cell as a function of temperature and find consistency with theoretical predictions based on group theories. We argue that this gigantic magneto- elastic coupling in RMnO3 holds the key to the recently observed magneto- electric phenomenon in this intriguing class of materials(6).","[Lee, Seongsu; Pirogov, A.; Kang, Misun; Jang, Kwang-Hyun; Park, J. -G.] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Phys, Suwon 440746, South Korea; [Lee, Seongsu; Pirogov, A.; Park, J. -G.] Seoul Natl Univ, Ctr Strongly Correlated Mat Res, Seoul 151742, South Korea; [Kamiyama, T.; Park, J. -G.] KEK, Inst Mat Struct Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050801, Japan; [Cheong, S. -W.] Rutgers State Univ, Rutgers Ctr Emergent Mat, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; [Cheong, S. -W.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; [Gozzo, F.] Paul Scherrer Inst, Swiss Light Source, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland; [Shin, Namsoo] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Pohang Accelerator Lab, Pohang 790784, South Korea; [Kimura, H.; Noda, Y.] Tohoku Univ, Inst Multidisciplinary Res Adv Mat, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan","Park, JG (reprint author), Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Phys, Suwon 440746, South Korea.",jgpark@skku.edu,"Park, Je Geun/K-8571-2013",,,,,28,238,240,12,125,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Feb,2008,451,7180,,,,,805,U4,,10.1038/nature06507,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,263BA,WOS:000253191400037,18273014.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,j. -g.,park,na,na,na,na,na

This is in principle feasible for nanodevices owing to their extremely low power consumption(2-5). Solar, thermal and mechanical ( wind, friction, body movement) energies are common and may be scavenged from the environment, but the type of energy source to be chosen has to be decided on the basis of specific applications. Military sensing/ surveillance node placement, for example, may involve difficult- to- reach locations, may need to be hidden, and may be in environments that are dusty, rainy, dark and/ or in deep forest. In a moving vehicle or aeroplane, harvesting energy from a rotating tyre or wind blowing on the body is a possible choice to power wireless devices implanted in the surface of the vehicle. Nanowire nanogenerators built on hard substrates were demonstrated for harvesting local mechanical energy produced by high- frequency ultrasonic waves(6,7). To harvest the energy from vibration or disturbance originating from footsteps, heartbeats, ambient noise and air flow, it is important to explore innovative technologies that work at low frequencies ( such as < 10 Hz) and that are based on flexible soft materials. Here we present a simple, low- cost approach that converts low- frequency vibration/ friction energy into electricity using piezoelectric zinc oxide nanowires grown radially around textile fibres. By entangling two fibres and brushing the nanowires rooted on them with respect to each other, mechanical energy is converted into electricity owing to a coupled piezoelectric - semiconductor process(8,9). This work establishes a methodology for scavenging light- wind energy and body- movement energy using fabrics.","[Qin, Yong; Wang, Xudong; Wang, Zhong Lin] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA","Wang, ZL (reprint author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",zlwang@gatech.edu,"Wang, Xudong/A-7067-2009; Wang, Zhong Lin/E-2176-2011; Qin, Yong/G-5890-2010","Wang, Zhong Lin/0000-0002-5530-0380; Qin, Yong/0000-0002-6713-480X",,,,14,917,943,72,613,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Feb,2008,451,7180,,,,,809,U5,,10.1038/nature06601,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,263BA,WOS:000253191400038,18273015.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,zhong lin,wang,na,na,na,na,na

Some have proposed that the mantle transition region has an olivine- rich 'pyrolite' composition(1,2), whereas others have inferred that it is characterized by pyroxene- and garnet- rich compositions ('piclogite'), because the sound velocities in pyrolite estimated from laboratory data are substantially higher than those seismologically observed(3-5). Although the velocities of the olivine polymorphs at these pressures ( wadsleyite and ringwoodite) have been well documented, those of majorite ( another significant high- pressure phase in the mantle transition region) with realistic mantle compositions have never been measured. Here we use combined in situ X- ray and ultrasonic measurements under the pressure and temperature conditions of the mantle transition region to show that majorite in a pyrolite composition has sound velocities substantially lower than those of earlier estimates, owing to strong nonlinear decreases at high temperature, particularly for shear- wave velocity. We found that pyrolite yields seismic velocities more consistent with typical seismological models than those of piclogite in the upper to middle parts of the region, except for the potentially larger velocity jumps in pyrolite relative to those observed at a depth of 410 km. In contrast, both of these compositions lead to significantly low shear- wave velocities in the lower part of the region, suggesting possible subadiabatic temperatures or the existence of a layer of harzburgite- rich material supplied by the subducted slabs stagnant at these depths.","[Irifune, T.; Higo, Y.; Inoue, T.; Kono, Y.; Ohfuji, H.] Ehime Univ, Geodynam Res Ctr, Matsuyama, Ehime 7908577, Japan; [Higo, Y.; Funakoshi, K.] Japan Synchrotron Res Inst, Hyogo 6795198, Japan","Irifune, T (reprint author), Ehime Univ, Geodynam Res Ctr, Matsuyama, Ehime 7908577, Japan.",irifune@dpc.ehime-u.ac.jp,,"Kono, Yoshio/0000-0001-5916-7524",,,,29,65,70,5,39,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Feb,2008,451,7180,,,,,814,817,,10.1038/nature06551,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,263BA,WOS:000253191400039,18273016.0,No,,,11/20/17,k.,funakoshi,na,na,na,na,na

Although recent studies unambiguously support bat monophyly(2-4) and consensus is rapidly emerging about evolutionary relationships among extant lineages(5-8), the fossil record of bats extends over 50 million years, and early evolution of the group remains poorly understood(5,7-9). Here we describe a new bat from the Early Eocene Green River Formation of Wyoming, USA, with features that are more primitive than seen in any previously known bat. The evolutionary pathways that led to flapping flight and echolocation in bats have been in dispute(7-18), and until now fossils have been of limited use in documenting transitions involved in this marked change in lifestyle. Phylogenetically informed comparisons of the new taxon with other bats and non- flying mammals reveal that critical morphological and functional changes evolved incrementally. Forelimb anatomy indicates that the new bat was capable of powered flight like other Eocene bats, but ear morphology suggests that it lacked their echolocation abilities, supporting a 'flight first' hypothesis for chiropteran evolution. The shape of the wings suggests that an undulating gliding - fluttering flight style may be primitive for bats, and the presence of a long calcar indicates that a broad tail membrane evolved early in Chiroptera, probably functioning as an additional airfoil rather than as a prey-capture device. Limb proportions and retention of claws on all digits indicate that the new bat may have been an agile climber that employed quadrupedal locomotion and under- branch hanging behaviour.","[Simmons, Nancy B.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Seymour, Kevin L.] Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto, ON M5S 2C6, Canada; [Habersetzer, Joerg] Forschungsinst Senckenberg, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany; [Gunnell, Gregg F.] Univ Michigan, Museum Paleontol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Simmons, NB (reprint author), Amer Museum Nat Hist, Cent Park W & 79th St, New York, NY 10024 USA.",simmons@amnh.org,,"Simmons, Nancy B./0000-0001-8807-7499",,,,38,150,166,8,186,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Feb,2008,451,7180,,,,,818,U6,,10.1038/nature06549,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,263BA,WOS:000253191400040,18270539.0,No,,,11/20/17,gregg f.,gunnell,na,na,na,na,na

However, experimental demonstrations of chaos in ecology are scarce, and have been limited to simple laboratory systems with a short duration and artificial species combinations(9-12). Here, we present the first experimental demonstration of chaos in a long- term experiment with a complex food web. Our food web was isolated from the Baltic Sea, and consisted of bacteria, several phytoplankton species, herbivorous and predatory zooplankton species, and detritivores. The food web was cultured in a laboratory mesocosm, and sampled twice a week for more than 2,300 days. Despite constant external conditions, the species abundances showed striking fluctuations over several orders of magnitude. These fluctuations displayed a variety of different periodicities, which could be attributed to different species interactions in the food web. The population dynamics were characterized by positive Lyapunov exponents of similar magnitude for each species. Predictability was limited to a time horizon of 15 - 30 days, only slightly longer than the local weather forecast. Hence, our results demonstrate that species interactions in food webs can generate chaos. This implies that stability is not required for the persistence of complex food webs, and that the long- term prediction of species abundances can be fundamentally impossible.","[Beninca, Elisa; Huisman, Jef; Johnk, Klaus D.; Branco, Pedro] Univ Amsterdam, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam, NL-1018 WS Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Beninca, Elisa; Van Nes, Egbert H.; Scheffer, Marten] Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Aquat Ecol & Water Qual Management, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Heerkloss, Reinhard] Univ Rostock, Inst Biosci, Rostock, Germany; [Ellner, Stephen P.] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Huisman, J (reprint author), Univ Amsterdam, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam, Nieuwe Achtergracht 127, NL-1018 WS Amsterdam, Netherlands.",jef.huisman@science.uva.nl,"van Nes, Egbert/F-2681-2011; Scheffer, Marten/C-1852-2012; Huisman, Jef/A-1089-2013; Johnk, Klaus/B-3382-2008","van Nes, Egbert/0000-0002-6345-104X; Johnk, Klaus/0000-0002-5972-4201",,,,30,155,161,10,153,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Feb,2008,451,7180,,,,,822,U7,,10.1038/nature06512,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,263BA,WOS:000253191400041,18273017.0,No,,,11/20/17,stephen p.,ellner,na,na,na,na,na

The simplest solution would be to pair them with negative charges(3). However, too few negatively charged channel residues are positioned for such a role(4,5). Recent studies suggest that some of the channel's positively charged residues are exposed to cell membrane phospholipids and interact with their head groups(5-9). A key question nevertheless remains: is the phosphohead of membrane lipids necessary for the proper function of the voltage sensor itself? Here we show that a given type of Kv channel may interact with several species of phospholipid and that enzymatic removal of their phospho-head creates an insuperable energy barrier for the positively charged voltage sensor to move through the initial gating step( s), thus immobilizing it, and also raises the energy barrier for the downstream step( s).","[Xu, Yanping; Ramu, Yajamana; Lu, Zhe] Univ Penn, Dept Physiol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Lu, Z (reprint author), Univ Penn, Dept Physiol, 3700 Hamilton Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",zhelu@mail.med.upenn.edu,,,NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM055560],,,31,120,121,1,12,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Feb,2008,451,7180,,,,,826,U8,,10.1038/nature06618,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,263BA,WOS:000253191400042,18273018.0,No,,,11/20/17,zhe,lu,na,na,na,na,na

A single calmodulin ( CaM) molecule associates constitutively with the channel's carboxy- terminal tail(3,10-13), and Ca2+ binding to the C- terminal and N- terminal lobes of CaM can each induce distinct channel regulations(2,14). As expected from close channel proximity, the C- lobe responds to the roughly 100-mu M Ca2+ pulses driven by the associated channel(15,16), a behaviour defined as 'local Ca2+ selectivity'. Conversely, all previous observations have indicated that the N- lobe somehow senses the far weaker signals from distant Ca2+ sources(2,3,17,18). This 'global Ca2+ selectivity' satisfies a general signalling requirement, enabling a resident molecule to remotely sense cellular Ca2+ activity, which would otherwise be overshadowed by Ca2+ entry through the host channel(5,6). Here we show that the spatial Ca2+ selectivity of N- lobe CaM regulation is not invariably global but can be switched by a novel Ca2+/CaM- binding site within the amino terminus of channels ( NSCaTE, for N- terminal spatial Ca2+ transforming element). Native Ca(V)2.2 channels lack this element and show N- lobe regulation with a global selectivity. On the introduction of NSCaTE into these channels, spatial Ca2+ selectivity transforms from a global to local profile. Given this effect, we examined Ca(V)1.2/ Ca(V)1.3 channels, which naturally contain NSCaTE, and found that their N- lobe selectivity is indeed local. Disruption of this element produces a global selectivity, confirming the native function of NSCaTE. Thus, differences in spatial selectivity between advanced Ca(V)1 and Ca(V)2 channel isoforms are explained by the presence or absence of NSCaTE. Beyond functional effects, the position of NSCaTE on the channel's amino terminus indicates that CaM can bridge the amino terminus and carboxy terminus of channels. Finally, the modularity of NSCaTE offers practical means for understanding the basis of global Ca2+ selectivity(19).","[Dick, Ivy E.; Tadross, Michael R.; Liang, Haoya; Tay, Lai Hock; Yang, Wanjun; Yue, David T.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Calcium Signals Lab, Dept Biomed Engn, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Dick, Ivy E.; Tadross, Michael R.; Liang, Haoya; Tay, Lai Hock; Yang, Wanjun; Yue, David T.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Calcium Signals Lab, Dept Neurosci, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Yue, DT (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Calcium Signals Lab, Dept Biomed Engn, Ross Bldg,Room 713,720 Rutland Ave, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",dyue@bme.jhu.edu,,,"NHLBI NIH HHS [R37 HL076795]; NIDCD NIH HHS [T32 DC000023, P30 DC005211]; NIMH NIH HHS [R01 MH065531]",,,38,142,147,0,15,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Feb,2008,451,7180,,,,,830,U9,,10.1038/nature06529,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,263BA,WOS:000253191400043,18235447.0,No,,,11/20/17,david t.,yue,na,na,na,na,na

Although post- invasive resistance responses typically coincide with a self- contained cell death of plant cells undergoing attack by parasites, these cells survive pre- invasive defence. Mutational analysis in Arabidopsis identified PEN1 syntaxin as one component of two pre- invasive resistance pathways against ascomycete powdery mildew fungi(1-3). Here we show that plasma- membrane- resident PEN1 promiscuously forms SDS- resistant soluble N- ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptor ( SNARE) complexes together with the SNAP33 adaptor and a subset of vesicle- associated membrane proteins ( VAMPs). PEN1- dependent disease resistance acts in vivo mainly through two functionally redundant VAMP72 subfamily members, VAMP721 and VAMP722. Unexpectedly, the same two VAMP proteins also operate redundantly in a default secretory pathway, suggesting dual functions in separate biological processes owing to evolutionary co- option of the default pathway for plant immunity. The disease resistance function of the secretory PEN1 - SNAP33 - VAMP721/ 722 complex and the pathogen- induced subcellular dynamics of its components are mechanistically reminiscent of immunological synapse formation in vertebrates, enabling execution of immune responses through focal secretion.","[Kwon, Chian; Neu, Christina; Pajonk, Simone; Yun, Hye Sup; Lipka, Ulrike; Humphry, Matt; Bau, Stefan; Straus, Marco; Kwaaitaal, Mark; Parker, Jane; Panstruga, Ralph; Lipka, Volker; Schulze-Lefert, Paul] Max Planck Inst Zuchtungsforsch, Dept Plant Microbe Interact, D-50829 Cologne, Germany; [Lipka, Ulrike; Rampelt, Heike; Lipka, Volker] Univ Tubingen, ZMBP, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany","Lipka, V (reprint author), John Innes Inst, John Innes Ctr Plant Sci Res, Sainsbury Lab, Colney Lane, Norwich NR4 7UH, Norfolk, England.",panstrug@mpiz-koeln.mpg.de; Volker.Lipka@sainsbury-laboratory.ac.uk; schlef@mpiz-koeln.mpg.de,"Schulze-Lefert, Paul/A-7746-2008; Humphry, Matthew/A-8136-2008; Lipka, Volker/C-5874-2009; Schulze-Lefert, Paul/B-6707-2011; Panstruga, Ralph/F-3340-2011; Humphry, Matt/E-8072-2010","Panstruga, Ralph/0000-0002-3756-8957; El Kasmi, Farid/0000-0002-4634-7689",,,,28,216,224,3,43,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Feb,2008,451,7180,,,,,835,U10,,10.1038/nature06545,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,263BA,WOS:000253191400044,18273019.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,paul,schulze-lefert,male,1,5931,na,na

The reaction is initiated by cytosine deamination by the activation- induced deaminase ( AID) and completed by error- prone processing of the resulting uracils by mismatch and base excision repair factors(1). Somatic hypermutation represents a threat to genome integrity(2) and it is not known how the B cell genome is protected from the mutagenic effects of somatic hypermutation nor how often these protective mechanisms fail. Here we show, by extensive sequencing of murine B cell genes, that the genome is protected by two distinct mechanisms: selective targeting of AID and gene- specific, high- fidelity repair of AID- generated uracils. Numerous genes linked to B cell tumorigenesis, including Myc, Pim1, Pax5, Ocab ( also called Pou2af1), H2afx, Rhoh and Ebf1, are deaminated by AID but escape acquisition of most mutations through the combined action of mismatch and base excision repair.

Dysregulation of p300/ CBP HAT activity contributes to various diseases including cancer(1-4). Sequence alignments, enzymology experiments and inhibitor studies on p300/ CBP have led to contradictory results about its catalytic mechanism and its structural relation to the Gcn5/ PCAF and MYST HATs(5-9). Here we describe a high- resolution X- ray crystal structure of a semi- synthetic heterodimeric p300 HAT domain in complex with a bi- substrate inhibitor, Lys- CoA. This structure shows that p300/ CBP is a distant cousin of other structurally characterized HATs, but reveals several novel features that explain the broad substrate specificity and preference for nearby basic residues. Based on this structure and accompanying biochemical data, we propose that p300/ CBP uses an unusual 'hitandrun' ( Theorell - Chance) catalytic mechanism that is distinct from other characterized HATs. Several disease- associated mutations can also be readily accounted for by the p300 HAT structure. These studies pave the way for new epigenetic therapies involving modulation of p300/ CBP HAT activity.","[Liu, Xin; Zhao, Kehao; Marmorstein, Ronen] Wistar Inst Anat & Biol, Program Gene Express & Regulat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Liu, Xin; Marmorstein, Ronen] Univ Penn, Dept Chem, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Wang, Ling; Thompson, Paul R.; Hwang, Yousang; Cole, Philip A.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol & Mol Sci, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Marmorstein, R (reprint author), Wistar Inst Anat & Biol, Program Gene Express & Regulat, 3601 Spruce St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",marmor@wistar.org; pcole@jhmi.edu,,,,,,30,206,213,1,28,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Feb,2008,451,7180,,,,,846,850,,10.1038/nature06546,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,263BA,WOS:000253191400046,18273021.0,No,,,11/20/17,philip a.,cole,na,na,na,na,na

It has been widely understood that precise comparisons of cellular RNAP crystal structures could reveal structural elements common to all enzymes and that these insights would be useful in analysing components of each enzyme that enable it to perform domain- specific gene expression. However, the structure of archaeal RNAP has been limited to individual subunits(3,4). Here we report the first crystal structure of the archaeal RNAP from Sulfolobus solfataricus at 3.4 angstrom resolution, completing the suite of multi- subunit RNAP structures from all three domains of life. We also report the high-resolution ( at 1.76 angstrom) crystal structure of the D/ L subcomplex of archaeal RNAP and provide the first experimental evidence of any RNAP possessing an iron - sulphur ( Fe - S) cluster, which may play a structural role in a key subunit of RNAP assembly. The striking structural similarity between archaeal RNAP and eukaryotic RNAPII highlights the simpler archaeal RNAP as an ideal model system for dissecting the molecular basis of eukaryotic transcription.","[Hirata, Akira; Klein, Brianna J.; Murakami, Katsuhiko S.] Penn State Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Murakami, KS (reprint author), Penn State Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",kum14@psu.edu,,,"NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM071897-04, R01 GM071897]",,,35,118,128,3,16,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,14-Feb,2008,451,7180,,,,,851,U12,,10.1038/nature06530,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,263BA,WOS:000253191400047,18235446.0,No,,,11/20/17,katsuhiko s.,murakami,na,na,na,na,na

On the basis of measles dynamics for industrialized countries, high birth rate regions should experience regular annual epidemics. Here, however, we show that measles epidemics in Niger are highly episodic, particularly in the capital Niamey. Models demonstrate that this variability arises from powerful seasonality in transmission - generating high amplitude epidemics - within the chaotic domain of deterministic dynamics. In practice, this leads to frequent stochastic fadeouts, interspersed with irregular, large epidemics. A metapopulation model illustrates how increased vaccine coverage, but still below the local elimination threshold, could lead to increasingly variable major outbreaks in highly seasonally forced contexts. Such erratic dynamics emphasize the importance both of control strategies that address build- up of susceptible individuals and efforts to mitigate the impact of large outbreaks when they occur.","[Ferrari, Matthew J.] Penn State Univ, Ctr Infect Dis Dynam, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Bharti, Nita; Bjornstad, Ottar N.; Grenfell, Bryan T.] Penn State Univ, Dept Biol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Bjornstad, Ottar N.] Penn State Univ, Dept Entomol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Grais, Rebecca F.; Guerin, Philippe J.] Epictr, F-75011 Paris, France; [Conlan, Andrew J.

The data imply considerably smaller velocities for the grains(2,5,6) than for the vapour(4,7), which has been difficult to understand. The gas and dust are too dilute in the plume to interact, so the difference must arise below the surface. Here we report a model for grain condensation and growth in channels of variable width. We show that repeated wall collisions of grains, with re- acceleration by the gas, induce an effective friction, offering a natural explanation for the reduced grain velocity. We derive particle speed and size distributions that reproduce the observed and inferred properties of the dust plume. The gas seems to form near the triple point of water; gas densities corresponding to sublimation from ice at temperatures less than 260K are generally too low to support the measured particle fluxes(2). This in turn suggests liquid water below Enceladus' south pole.","[Schmidt, Juergen; Brilliantov, Nikolai; Spahn, Frank] Univ Potsdam, Neuen Palais 10, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany; [Brilliantov, Nikolai] Univ Leicester, Dept Math, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; [Brilliantov, Nikolai] Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Dept Phys, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Kempf, Sascha] Max Planck Inst Kernphys, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Kempf, Sascha] Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, IGEP, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany","Schmidt, J (reprint author), Univ Potsdam, Neuen Palais 10, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany.",jschmidt@agnld.uni-potsdam.de,"Brilliantov , Nikolay/A-7423-2014","Brilliantov , Nikolay/0000-0002-7107-0693; KEMPF, SASCHA/0000-0001-5236-3004",,,,28,82,83,2,26,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Feb,2008,451,7179,,,,,685,688,,10.1038/nature06491,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,259HD,WOS:000252929500034,18256665.0,No,,,11/20/17,sascha,kempf,female,0.51,158,na,na

The stability of these pairs determines the robustness of the superfluid state, and the quest for superconductors with high critical temperature equates to a search for systems with strong pairing mechanisms. Ultracold atomic Fermi gases present a highly controllable model system for studying strongly interacting fermions(1). Tunable interactions ( through Feshbach collisional resonances) and the control of population or mass imbalance among the spin components provide unique opportunities to investigate the stability of pairing(2-4) - and possibly to search for exotic forms of superfluidity(5,6). A major controversy has surrounded the stability of superfluidity against an imbalance between the two spin components when the fermions interact resonantly ( that is, at unitarity). Here we present the phase diagram of a spin- polarized Fermi gas of Li-6 atoms at unitarity, experimentally mapping out the superfluid phases versus temperature and density imbalance. Using tomographic techniques, we reveal spatial discontinuities in the spin polarization; this is the signature of a first- order superfluid- to- normal phase transition, and disappears at a tricritical point where the nature of the phase transition changes from first- order to second- order. At zero temperature, there is a quantum phase transition from a fully paired superfluid to a partially polarized normal gas. These observations and the implementation of an in situ ideal gas thermometer provide quantitative tests of theoretical calculations on the stability of resonant superfluidity.","[Shin, Yong-Il; Schunck, Christian H.; Schirotzek, Andre; Ketterle, Wolfgang] MIT, Dept Phys, MIT Harvard Ctr Ultracold Atoms, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Shin, Yong-Il; Schunck, Christian H.; Schirotzek, Andre; Ketterle, Wolfgang] MIT, Elect Res Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Shin, YI (reprint author), MIT, Dept Phys, MIT Harvard Ctr Ultracold Atoms, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",yishin@mit.edu,"Shin, Yong-il/B-1955-2008","Shin, Yong-il/0000-0003-0481-9841; Schunck, Christian H/0000-0002-7917-8180",,,,30,214,216,1,25,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Feb,2008,451,7179,,,,,689,U1,,10.1038/nature06473,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,259HD,WOS:000252929500035,18256666.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,wolfgang,ketterle,male,1,95,na,na

Currently commercially available holographic 3D displays(3) use photopolymers that lack image- updating capability, resulting in restricted use and high cost. Photorefractive polymers(4-9) are dynamic holographic recording materials that allow updating of images and have a wide range of applications, including optical correlation(10), imaging through scattering media(11) and optical communication(12,13). To be suitable for 3D displays, photorefractive polymers need to have nearly 100% diffraction efficiency, fast writing time, hours of image persistence, rapid erasure, and large area - a combination of properties that has not been shown before. Here, we report an updatable holographic 3D display based on photorefractive polymers with such properties, capable of recording and displaying new images every few minutes.

In situ investigation of the geological processes at active erosive margins is extremely difficult owing to the deep marine environment and the net loss of forearc crust to deeper levels in the subduction zone. Until now, a fossil erosive subduction channel - the shear zone marking the plate boundary(3) - has not been recognized in the field, so that seismic observations have provided the only information on plate boundary processes at erosive margins. Here we show that a fossil erosive margin is preserved in the Northern Apennines of Italy. It formed during the Tertiary transition from oceanic subduction to continental collision, and was preserved by the late deactivation and fossilization of the plate boundary. The outcropping erosive subduction channel is similar to 500 m thick. It is representative of the first 5 km of depth, with its deeper portions reaching similar to 150 degrees C. The fossil zone records several surprises. Two decollements were simultaneously active at the top and base of the subduction channel. Both deeper basal erosion and near- surface frontal erosion occurred. At shallow depths extension was a key deformation component within this erosive convergent plate boundary, and slip occurred without an observable fluid pressure cycle. At depths greater than about 3 km a fluid cycle is clearly shown by the development of veins and the alternation of fast ( co- seismic) and slow ( inter- seismic) slip. In the deepest portions of the outcropping subduction channel, extension is finally overprinted by compressional structures. In modern subduction zones the onset of seismic activity is believed to occur at similar to 150 degrees C, but in the fossil channel the onset occurred at cooler palaeo- temperatures.","[Vannucchi, Paola] Univ Florence, Dipartimento Sci Terra, I-50121 Florence, Italy; [Remitti, Francesca; Bettelli, Giuseppe] Univ Modena, Dipartimento Sci Terra, I-41100 Modena, Italy","Vannucchi, P (reprint author), Univ Florence, Dipartimento Sci Terra, Via Pira 4, I-50121 Florence, Italy.",paola.vannucchi@unifi.it,"remitti, francesca/E-7856-2012","remitti, francesca/0000-0002-0720-1927",,,,28,69,69,1,19,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Feb,2008,451,7179,,,,,699,703,,10.1038/nature06486,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,259HD,WOS:000252929500037,18256668.0,No,,,11/20/17,giuseppe,bettelli,male,1,774,na,na

Research in the physical sciences has been able to generate statements about the ancient environment that hosted this life(3-6). These include the chemical compositions and temperatures of the early ocean and atmosphere. Only recently have the natural sciences been able to provide experimental results describing the environments of ancient life. Our previous work with resurrected proteins indicated that ancient life lived in a hot environment(7,8). Here we expand the timescale of resurrected proteins to provide a palaeotemperature trend of the environments that hosted life from 3.5 to 0.5 billion years ago. The thermostability of more than 25 phylogenetically dispersed ancestral elongation factors suggest that the environment supporting ancient life cooled progressively by 30 degrees C during that period. Here we show that our results are robust to potential statistical bias associated with the posterior distribution of inferred character states, phylogenetic ambiguity, and uncertainties in the amino- acid equilibrium frequencies used by evolutionary models. Our results are further supported by a nearly identical cooling trend for the ancient ocean as inferred from the deposition of oxygen isotopes. The convergence of results from natural and physical sciences suggest that ancient life has continually adapted to changes in environmental temperatures throughout its evolutionary history.","[Gaucher, Eric A.] Fdn Appl Mol Evolut, Gainesville, FL 32601 USA; [Govindarajan, Sridhar] DNA2 0 Inc, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Ganesh, Omjoy K.] Univ Florida, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA","Gaucher, EA (reprint author), Fdn Appl Mol Evolut, Gainesville, FL 32601 USA.",egaucher@ffame.org,"Gaucher, Eric/I-7313-2013",,,,,30,150,152,3,68,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Feb,2008,451,7179,,,,,704,U2,,10.1038/nature06510,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,259HD,WOS:000252929500038,18256669.0,No,,,11/20/17,omjoy k.,ganesh,na,na,na,na,na

Our direct measure of niche breadth for bacterial functional assemblages indicates that, in accordance with ecological theory, heterogeneity in the composition and supply of organic carbon to coastal oceans may favour generalist bacteria. In the important interplay between microbial community structure and biogeochemical cycling, coastal heterotrophic communities may be controlled less by transient changes in the carbon reservoir that they process and more by factors such as trophic interactions and physical conditions.","[Mou, Xiaozhen; Sun, Shulei; Hodson, Robert E.; Moran, Mary Ann] Univ Georgia, Dept Marine Sci, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Edwards, Robert A.] San Diego State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, San Diego, CA 92182 USA","Moran, MA (reprint author), Univ Georgia, Dept Marine Sci, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",mmoran@uga.edu,"Moran, Mary Ann/B-6939-2012","Moran, Mary Ann/0000-0002-0702-8167",,,,37,163,173,4,84,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Feb,2008,451,7179,,,,,708,U4,,10.1038/nature06513,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,259HD,WOS:000252929500039,18223640.0,No,,,11/20/17,mary ann,moran,female,1,102,O8RSuzkAAAAJ,14964

They are expected to increase similarly over the next 50 years in industrializing nations of Asia and South America(2). Although the environmental impacts of high rates of nitrogen addition have been well studied(3-8), this is not so for the lower, chronic rates that characterize much of the globe. Here we present results of the first multi- decadal experiment to examine the impacts of chronic, experimental nitrogen addition as low as 10 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) above ambient atmospheric nitrogen deposition ( 6 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) at our site). This total input rate is comparable to terrestrial nitrogen deposition in many industrialized nations(2). We found that this chronic low- level nitrogen addition rate reduced plant species numbers by 17% relative to controls receiving ambient N deposition. Moreover, species numbers were reduced more per unit of added nitrogen at lower addition rates, suggesting that chronic but low- level nitrogen deposition may have a greater impact on diversity than previously thought. A second experiment showed that a decade after cessation of nitrogen addition, relative plant species number, although not species abundances, had recovered, demonstrating that some effects of nitrogen addition are reversible.","[Clark, Christopher M.; Tilman, David] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Clark, CM (reprint author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, 100 Ecol,1987 Upper Buford Circle, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",clark134@umn.edu,,,,,,28,333,395,25,298,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Feb,2008,451,7179,,,,,712,715,,10.1038/nature06503,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,259HD,WOS:000252929500040,18256670.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,david,tilman,male,1,12593,xlfT8vcAAAAJ,123974

Here we measure the speed of population ageing by using conventional measures and new ones that take changes in longevity into account for the world as a whole and for 13 major regions. We report on future levels of indicators of ageing and the speed at which they change. We show how these depend on whether changes in life expectancy are taken into account. We also show that the speed of ageing is likely to increase over the coming decades and to decelerate in most regions by mid-century. All our measures indicate a continuous ageing of the world's population throughout the century. The median age of the world's population increases from 26.6 years in 2000 to 37.3 years in 2050 and then to 45.6 years in 2100, when it is not adjusted for longevity increase. When increases in life expectancy are taken into account(2,3), the adjusted median age rises from 26.6 in 2000 to 31.1 in 2050 and only to 32.9 in 2100, slightly less than what it was in the China region in 2005. There are large differences in the regional patterns of ageing. In North America, the median age adjusted for life expectancy change falls throughout almost the entire century, whereas the conventional median age increases significantly. Our assessment of trends in ageing is based on new probabilistic population forecasts. The probability that growth in the world's population will end during this century is 88%, somewhat higher than previously assessed(4). After mid- century, lower rates of population growth are likely to coincide with slower rates of ageing.","[Lutz, Wolfgang; Sanderson, Warren; Scherbov, Sergei] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, World Populat Program, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Lutz, Wolfgang; Scherbov, Sergei] Austrian Acad Sci, Vienna Inst Demog, A-1040 Vienna, Austria; [Sanderson, Warren] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Econ, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Sanderson, Warren] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Hist, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA","Lutz, W (reprint author), Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, World Populat Program, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria.",lutz@iiasa.ac.at,,,,,,19,392,403,7,92,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Feb,2008,451,7179,,,,,716,719,,10.1038/nature06516,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,259HD,WOS:000252929500041,18204438.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,sergei,scherbov,male,0.97,38,qxDURIsAAAAJ,4961

A fundamental tenet of the amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease is that the deposition of amyloid-beta precedes and induces the neuronal abnormalities that underlie dementia(1). This idea has been challenged, however, by the suggestion that alterations in axonal trafficking and morphological abnormalities precede and lead to senile plaques(2). The role of microglia in accelerating or retarding these processes has been uncertain. To investigate the temporal relation between plaque formation and the changes in local neuritic architecture, we used longitudinal in vivo multiphoton microscopy to sequentially image young APPswe/ PS1d9xYFP ( B6C3-YFP) transgenic mice(3). Here we show that plaques form extraordinarily quickly, over 24 h. Within 1-2 days of a new plaque's appearance, microglia are activated and recruited to the site. Progressive neuritic changes ensue, leading to increasingly dysmorphic neurites over the next days to weeks. These data establish plaques as a critical mediator of neuritic pathology.","[Meyer-Luehmann, Melanie; Spires-Jones, Tara L.; Prada, Claudia; Garcia-Alloza, Monica; de Calignon, Alix; Rozkalne, Anete; Bacskai, Brian J.; Hyman, Bradley T.] Harvard Univ, Massgen Inst Neurodegenerat Dis, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Alzheimers Dis Res Lab,Dept Neurol,Sch Med, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Koenigsknecht-Talboo, Jessica; Holtzman, David M.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA","Hyman, BT (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Massgen Inst Neurodegenerat Dis, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Alzheimers Dis Res Lab,Dept Neurol,Sch Med, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA.",bhyman@partners.org,,"Meyer-Luehmann, Melanie/0000-0003-3661-2220; Garcia-Alloza, Monica/0000-0003-1610-4114; Spires-Jones, Tara/0000-0003-2530-0598","NIA NIH HHS [P50 AG005134, R01 AG008487, R01 AG008487-20]; NIDDK NIH HHS [P30 DK056341, P30 DK056341-07, P30 DK056341-08]",,,27,553,561,6,75,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Feb,2008,451,7179,,,,,720,U5,,10.1038/nature06616,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,259HD,WOS:000252929500042,18256671.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,bradley t.,hyman,na,na,na,na,na

In the case of DNA vaccines(3), this consists of plasmid DNA; however, the adjuvant element( s) as well as its intra- and inter- cellular innate immune signalling pathway( s) leading to the encoded antigen- specific T- and B- cell responses remain unclear. Here we demonstrate in vivo that TANK- binding kinase 1 ( TBK1), a non- canonical I kappa B kinase, mediates the adjuvant effect of DNA vaccines and is essential for its immunogenicity in mice. Plasmid-DNA- activated, TBK1- dependent signalling and the resultant type- I interferon receptor- mediated signalling was required for induction of antigen- specific B and T cells, which occurred even in the absence of innate immune signalling through a well known CpG DNA sensor - Toll- like receptor 9 ( TLR9) or Z- DNA binding protein 1 ( ZBP1, also known as DAI, which was recently reported as a potential B- form DNA sensor(4)). Moreover, bone- marrow-transfer experiments revealed that TBK1- mediated signalling in haematopoietic cells was critical for the induction of antigenspecific B and CD4(+) T cells, whereas in non- haematopoietic cells TBK1 was required for CD8(+) T- cell induction. These data suggest that TBK1 is a key signalling molecule for DNA- vaccine- induced immunogenicity, by differentially controlling DNA- activated innate immune signalling through haematopoietic and nonhaematopoietic cells.","[Ishii, Ken J.; Kawai, Taro; Takeuchi, Osamu; Akira, Shizuo] Osaka Univ, ERATO, Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Ishii, Ken J.] Osaka Univ, Dept Mol Protozool, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Ishii, Ken J.; Kawagoe, Tatsukata; Koyama, Shohei; Kumar, Himanshu; Kawai, Taro; Uematsu, Satoshi; Takeuchi, Osamu; Coban, Cevayir; Akira, Shizuo] Osaka Univ, Host Def Lab, WPI Immunol Frontier Res Ctr, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Kawagoe, Tatsukata; Koyama, Shohei; Matsui, Kosuke; Kumar, Himanshu; Kawai, Taro; Uematsu, Satoshi; Takeuchi, Osamu; Coban, Cevayir; Akira, Shizuo] Osaka Univ, Dept Host Def, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Coban, Cevayir; Akira, Shizuo] Osaka Univ, Century Ctr Excellence COE 21, Combined Program Microbiol & Immunol, Res Inst Microbial Dis, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Takeshita, Fumihiko] Yokohama City Univ, Dept Mol Biodef Res, Grad Sch Med, Kanagawa 2360004, Japan; [Koyama, Shohei] Tohoku Univ, Inst Dev Aging & Canc, Sendai, Miyagi 9808575, Japan","Ishii, KJ (reprint author), Osaka Univ, ERATO, Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, 2-2 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan.",kenishii@biken.osaka-u.ac.jp; sakira@biken.osaka-u.ac.jp,"Akira, Shizuo/C-3134-2009; Kumar, Himanshu/A-8070-2010; Takeuchi, Osamu/D-6007-2011; Coban, Cevayir/B-2129-2012; Kumar, Himanshu/J-4494-2012; Ishii, Ken/B-1685-2012","Kumar, Himanshu/0000-0001-5246-2694; Ishii, Ken/0000-0002-6728-3872; Koyama, Shohei/0000-0002-6897-9417",,,,30,352,369,2,33,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Feb,2008,451,7179,,,,,725,U6,,10.1038/nature06537,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,259HD,WOS:000252929500043,18256672.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,shizuo,akira,na,na,na,na,na

A common mechanism by which germline progenitors are protected from differentiation- inducing signals is a transient and global repression of RNA polymerase II ( RNAPII)- dependent transcription(1). In both Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans embryos, the repression of messenger RNA transcription during germ cell specification correlates with an absence of phosphorylation of Ser 2 residues in the carboxy- terminal domain of RNAPII ( hereafter called CTD)(2), a critical modification for transcriptional elongation(3). Here we show that, in Drosophila embryos, a small protein encoded by polar granule component ( pgc) is essential for repressing CTD Ser 2 phosphorylation in newly formed pole cells, the germline progenitors. Ectopic Pgc expression in somatic cells is sufficient to repress CTD Ser 2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, Pgc interacts, physically and genetically, with positive transcription elongation factor b ( P- TEFb), the CTD Ser 2 kinase complex, and prevents its recruitment to transcription sites. These results indicate that Pgc is a cell- type- specific P- TEFb inhibitor that has a fundamental role in Drosophila germ cell specification. In C. elegans embryos, PIE- 1 protein segregates to germline blastomeres, and is thought to repress mRNA transcription through interaction with P- TEFb(4-7). Thus, inhibition of P- TEFb is probably a common mechanism during germ cell specification in the disparate organisms C. elegans and Drosophila.","[Hanyu-Nakamura, Kazuko; Sonobe-Nojima, Hiroko; Tanigawa, Akie; Nakamura, Akira] RIKEN, Ctr Dev Biol, Lab Germline Dev, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan; [Lasko, Paul] McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada","Nakamura, A (reprint author), RIKEN, Ctr Dev Biol, Lab Germline Dev, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan.",akiran@cdb.riken.jp,"Lasko, Paul/C-6761-2014","Lasko, Paul/0000-0002-4037-3501; Nakamura, Akira/0000-0001-6506-9146","NICHD NIH HHS [R01 HD036631, R01 HD036631-10]",,,33,85,87,1,12,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,7-Feb,2008,451,7179,,,,,730,U7,,10.1038/nature06498,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,259HD,WOS:000252929500044,18200011.0,No,,,11/20/17,akira,nakamura,male,0.86,56,na,na

However, in Schizosaccharomyces pombe RNA polymerase II ( RNAPII) transcription of centromeric repeats is essential for RNA- interference- mediated heterochromatin assembly(2-5). Here we study heterochromatin dynamics during the cell cycle and its effect on RNAPII transcription. We describe a brief period during the S phase of the cell cycle in which RNAPII preferentially transcribes centromeric repeats. This period is enforced by heterochromatin, which restricts RNAPII accessibility at centromeric repeats for most of the cell cycle. RNAPII transcription during S phase is linked to loading of RNA interference and heterochromatin factors such as the Ago1 subunit of the RITS complex(6) and the Clr4 methyltransferase complex subunit Rik1 ( ref. 7). Moreover, Set2, an RNAPII- associated methyltransferase(8) that methylates histone H3 lysine 36 at repeat loci during S phase, acts in a pathway parallel to Clr4 to promote heterochromatin assembly. We also show that phosphorylation of histone H3 serine 10 alters heterochromatin during mitosis, correlating with recruitment of condensin that affects silencing of centromeric repeats. Our analyses suggest at least two distinct modes of heterochromatin targeting to centromeric repeats, whereby RNAPII transcription of repeats and chromodomain proteins bound to methylated histone H3 lysine 9 mediate recruitment of silencing factors. Together, these processes probably facilitate heterochromatin maintenance through successive cell divisions.","[Chen, Ee Sin; Zhang, Ke; Nicolas, Estelle; Cam, Hugh P.; Zofall, Martin; Grewal, Shiv I.

We apply this model to the segmentation gene network of Drosophila melanogaster and find that it predicts expression patterns of cis- regulatory modules with remarkable accuracy, demonstrating that positional information is encoded in the regulatory sequence and input factor distribution. Our analysis reveals that both strong and weaker binding sites contribute, leading to high occupancy of the module DNA, and conferring robustness against mutation; short- range homotypic clustering of weaker sites facilitates cooperative binding, which is necessary to sharpen the patterns.

Formally, this requires the inclusion of a term acting as a negative pressure in the equations of cosmic expansion, accounting for about 75 per cent of the total energy density in the Universe. The simplest option for this 'dark energy' corresponds to a 'cosmological constant', perhaps related to the quantum vacuum energy. Physically viable alternatives invoke either the presence of a scalar field with an evolving equation of state, or extensions of general relativity involving higher- order curvature terms or extra dimensions(4-8). Although they produce similar expansion rates, different models predict measurable differences in the growth rate of large- scale structure with cosmic time(9). A fingerprint of this growth is provided by coherent galaxy motions, which introduce a radial anisotropy in the clustering pattern reconstructed by galaxy redshift surveys(10). Here we report a measurement of this effect at a redshift of 0.8. Using a new survey of more than 10,000 faint galaxies(11,12), we measure the anisotropy parameter beta=0.70 +/- 0.26, which corresponds to a growth rate of structure at that time of f = 0.9 +/- 0.36. This is consistent with the standard cosmological- constant model with low matter density and flat geometry, although the error bars are still too large to distinguish among alternative origins for the accelerated expansion.

The most useful piezoelectric materials display a transition region in their composition phase diagrams, known as a morphotropic phase boundary(1,2), where the crystal structure changes abruptly and the electromechanical properties are maximal. As a result, modern piezoelectric materials for technological applications are usually complex, engineered, solid solutions, which complicates their manufacture as well as introducing complexity in the study of the microscopic origins of their properties. Here we show that even a pure compound, in this case lead titanate, can display a morphotropic phase boundary under pressure. The results are consistent with first-principles theoretical predictions(3), but show a richer phase diagram than anticipated; moreover, the predicted electromechanical coupling at the transition is larger than any known. Our results show that the high electromechanical coupling in solid solutions with lead titanate is due to tuning of the high- pressure morphotropic phase boundary in pure lead titanate to ambient pressure. We also find that complex microstructures or compositions are not necessary to obtain strong piezoelectricity. This opens the door to the possible discovery of high- performance, pure-compound electromechanical materials, which could greatly decrease costs and expand the utility of piezoelectric materials.","[Ahart, Muhtar; Somayazulu, Maddury; Cohen, R.

If the process is accompanied by effective control over the interactions between the blocks and all entropic effects(1,2), then the resultant structures will be ordered with a precision hard to achieve with other fabrication methods. But it remains challenging to use self- assembly to design systems comprised of different types of building blocks - to realize novel magnetic, plasmonic and photonic metamaterials(3-5), for example. A conceptually simple idea for overcoming this problem is the use of 'encodable' interactions between building blocks; this can in principle be straightforwardly implemented using biomolecules(6-10). Strategies that use DNA programmability to control the placement of nanoparticles in one and two dimensions have indeed been demonstrated(11-13). However, our theoretical understanding of how to extend this approach to three dimensions is limited(14,15), and most experiments have yielded amorphous aggregates(16-19) and only occasionally crystallites of close- packed micrometre- sized particles(9,10). Here, we report the formation of three- dimensional crystalline assemblies of gold nanoparticles mediated by interactions between complementary DNA molecules attached to the nanoparticles' surface. We find that the nanoparticle crystals form reversibly during heating and cooling cycles. Moreover, the body- centred- cubic lattice structure is temperature-tuneable and structurally open, with particles occupying only similar to 4% of the unit cell volume. We expect that our DNA-mediated crystallization approach, and the insight into DNA design requirements it has provided, will facilitate both the creation of new classes of ordered multicomponent metamaterials and the exploration of the phase behaviour of hybrid systems with addressable interactions.","[Nykypanchuk, Dmytro; Maye, Mathew M.; Gang, Oleg] Brookhaven Natl Lab, Ctr Funct Nanomat, Upton, NY 11973 USA; [van der Lelie, Daniel] Brookhaven Natl Lab, Dept Biol, Upton, NY 11973 USA","Gang, O (reprint author), Brookhaven Natl Lab, Ctr Funct Nanomat, Upton, NY 11973 USA.",ogang@bnl.gov,"Han, Kyuhee/B-6201-2009",,,,,28,844,852,36,525,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,31-Jan,2008,451,7178,,,,,549,552,,10.1038/nature06560,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,256OQ,WOS:000252739900036,18235496.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,oleg,gang,male,0.99,86,aYHtwgYAAAAJ,4962

Since then, oligonucleotide-functionalized nanoparticles have been developed into powerful diagnostic tools(3,4) for nucleic acids and proteins, and into intracellular probes(5) and gene regulators(6). In contrast, the conceptually simple yet powerful idea that functionalized nanoparticles might serve as basic building blocks that can be rationally assembled through programmable base- pairing interactions into highly ordered macroscopic materials remains poorly developed. So far, the approach has mainly resulted in polymerization, with modest control over the placement of, the periodicity in, and the distance between particles within the assembled material. That is, most of the materials obtained thus far are best classified as amorphous polymers(7-16), although a few examples of colloidal crystal formation exist(8,16). Here, we demonstrate that DNA can be used to control the crystallization of nanoparticle - oligonucleotide conjugates to the extent that different DNA sequences guide the assembly of the same type of inorganic nanoparticle into different crystalline states. We show that the choice of DNA sequences attached to the nanoparticle building blocks, the DNA linking molecules and the absence or presence of a non- bonding single- base flexor can be adjusted so that gold nanoparticles assemble into micrometresized face- centred- cubic or body- centred- cubic crystal structures. Our findings thus clearly demonstrate that synthetically programmable colloidal crystallization is possible, and that a single-component system can be directed to form different structures.","[Park, Sung Yong; Lytton-Jean, Abigail K.

It is widely thought that rising Atlantic sea surface temperatures have had a role in this(16,17), but the magnitude of this contribution is not known. Here we quantify this contribution for storms that formed in the tropical North Atlantic, Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico; these regions together account for most of the hurricanes that make landfall in the United States. We show that a statistical model based on two environmental variables local sea surface temperature and an atmospheric wind field - can replicate a large proportion of the variance in tropical Atlantic hurricane frequency and activity between 1965 and 2005. We then remove the influence of the atmospheric wind field to assess the contribution of sea surface temperature. Our results indicate that the sensitivity of tropical Atlantic hurricane activity to August September sea surface temperature over the period we consider is such that a 0.5 degrees C increase in sea surface temperature is associated with a similar to 40% increase in hurricane frequency and activity. The results also indicate that local sea surface warming was responsible for similar to 40% of the increase in hurricane activity relative to the 1950 2000 average between 1996 and 2005. Our analysis does not identify whether warming induced by greenhouse gases contributed to the increase in hurricane activity, but the ability of climate models to reproduce the observed relationship between hurricanes and sea surface temperature will serve as a useful means of assessing whether they are likely to provide reliable projections of future changes in Atlantic hurricane activity.","[Saunders, Mark A.; Lea, Adam S.] UCL, Dept Space & Climate Phys, Benfield UCL Hazard Res Ctr, Dorking RH5 6NT, Surrey, England","Saunders, MA (reprint author), UCL, Dept Space & Climate Phys, Benfield UCL Hazard Res Ctr, Holmbury St Mary, Dorking RH5 6NT, Surrey, England.",mas@mssl.ucl.ac.uk,,,,,,31,89,93,3,44,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,31-Jan,2008,451,7178,,,,,557,U3,,10.1038/nature06422,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,256OQ,WOS:000252739900038,18235498.0,No,,,11/20/17,adam s.,lea,na,na,na,na,na

Here we report on two great earthquakes that occurred near the Kuril islands, which shed light on this process and demonstrate the enhanced seismic hazard accompanying triggered faulting. On 15 November 2006, an event of moment magnitude 8.3 ruptured the shallow- dipping plate boundary along which the Pacific plate descends beneath the central Kuril arc. The thrust ruptured a seismic gap that previously had uncertain seismogenic potential(4,5), although the earlier occurrence of outer- rise compressional events had suggested the presence of frictional resistance(1,2). Within minutes of this large underthrusting event, intraplate extensional earthquakes commenced in the outer rise region seaward of the Kuril trench, and on 13 January 2007, an event of moment magnitude 8.1 ruptured a normal fault extending through the upper portion of the Pacific plate, producing one of the largest recorded shallow extensional earthquakes. This energetic earthquake sequence demonstrates the stress transfer process within the subducting lithosphere, and the distinct rupture characteristics of these great earthquakes illuminate differences in seismogenic properties and seismic hazard of such interplate and intraplate faults.","[Lay, Thorne] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Ammon, Charles J.] Penn State Univ, Dept Geosci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Kanamori, Hiroo] CALTECH, Seismol Lab, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Lay, T (reprint author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",thorne@pmc.ucsc.edu,,,,,,30,93,94,2,18,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,31-Jan,2008,451,7178,,,,,561,U4,,10.1038/nature06521,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,256OQ,WOS:000252739900039,18235499.0,No,,,11/20/17,thorne,lay,female,1,1,Ch8Cef0AAAAJ,17344

Chromosome- based systems ( genotypic sex determination) that generate roughly equal numbers of sons and daughters accord with theory(1), but the adaptive significance of environmental sex determination ( that is, when embryonic environmental conditions determine offspring sex, ESD) is a major unsolved problem(2,3). Theoretical models predict that selection should favour ESD over genotypic sex determination when the developmental environment differentially influences male versus female fitness ( that is, the Charnov - Bull model)(4), but empirical evidence for this hypothesis remains elusive in amniote vertebrates - the clade in which ESD is most prevalent(5). Here we provide the first substantial empirical support for this model by showing that incubation temperatures influence reproductive success of males differently than that of females in a short- lived lizard ( Amphibolurus muricatus, Agamidae) with temperature- dependent sex determination. We incubated eggs at a variety of temperatures, and de- confounded sex and incubation temperature by using hormonal manipulations to embryos. We then raised lizards in field enclosures and quantified their lifetime reproductive success. Incubation temperature affected reproductive success differently in males versus females in exactly the way predicted by theory: the fitness of each sex was maximized by the incubation temperature that produces that sex.

The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans also has a quiescent behavioural state during a period called lethargus, which occurs before each of the four moults(4). Like sleep, lethargus maintains a constant temporal relationship with the expression of the C. elegans Period homologue LIN-42 ( ref. 5). Here we show that quiescence associated with lethargus has the additional sleep- like properties of reversibility, reduced responsiveness and homeostasis. We identify the cGMP-dependent protein kinase ( PKG) gene egl- 4 as a regulator of sleep-like behaviour, and show that egl- 4 functions in sensory neurons to promote the C. elegans sleep- like state. Conserved effects on sleep- like behaviour of homologous genes in C. elegans and Drosophila suggest a common genetic regulation of sleep- like states in arthropods and nematodes. Our results indicate that C. elegans is a suitable model system for the study of sleep regulation. The association of this C. elegans sleep- like state with developmental changes that occur with larval moults suggests that sleep may have evolved to allow for developmental changes.","[Raizen, David M.; Zimmerman, John E.; Maycock, Matthew H.; Ta, Uyen D.; Pack, Allan I.] Univ Penn, Sch Med, Ctr Sleep & Resp Neurobiol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Raizen, David M.; Ta, Uyen D.] Univ Penn, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Sundaram, Meera V.] Univ Penn, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Pack, Allan I.] Univ Penn, Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Sleep Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [You, Young-Jai] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Mol Biol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA","Raizen, DM (reprint author), Univ Penn, Sch Med, Ctr Sleep & Resp Neurobiol, 3400 Spruce St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",raizen@mail.med.upenn.edu,,"Sundaram, Meera/0000-0002-2940-8750",,,,30,181,192,2,22,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,31-Jan,2008,451,7178,,,,,569,U6,,10.1038/nature06535,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,256OQ,WOS:000252739900041,18185515.0,No,,,11/20/17,allan i.,pack,na,na,na,na,na

MAVS activation leads to the rapid production of antiviral cytokines, including type 1 interferons. Although MAVS is vital to antiviral immunity, its regulation from within the mitochondria remains unknown. Here we describe human NLRX1, a highly conserved nucleotide- binding domain ( NBD)- and leucine- rich- repeat ( LRR)- containing family member ( known as NLR) that localizes to the mitochondrial outer membrane and interacts with MAVS. Expression of NLRX1 results in the potent inhibition of RLH- and MAVS- mediated interferon-beta promoter activity and in the disruption of virus- induced RLH-MAVS interactions. Depletion of NLRX1 with small interference RNA promotes virus- induced type I interferon production and decreases viral replication. This work identifies NLRX1 as a check against mitochondrial antiviral responses and represents an intersection of three ancient cellular processes: NLR signalling, intracellular virus detection and the use of mitochondria as a platform for anti- pathogen signalling. This represents a conceptual advance, in that NLRX1 is a modulator of pathogen- associated molecular pattern receptors rather than a receptor, and identifies a key therapeutic target for enhancing antiviral responses.","[Moore, Chris B.; Lei, Yu; Zimmermann, Albert G.; Ye, Zhengmao; Lich, John D.; Ting, Jenny P-Y.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Microbiol Immunol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Moore, Chris B.; Bergstralh, Daniel T.; Lei, Yu; Zimmermann, Albert G.; Ye, Zhengmao; Lich, John D.; Ting, Jenny P-Y.] Univ N Carolina, Lineberger Comprehens Canc Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Duncan, Joseph A.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Med, Div Infect Dis, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Morrison, Thomas E.; Heise, Mark T.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Genet, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Morrison, Thomas E.; Heise, Mark T.] Univ N Carolina, Carolina Vaccine Inst, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Madden, Victoria J.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Pathol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Accavitti-Loper, Mary A.] Univ Alabama, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; [Sun, Lijun; Chen, Zhijian] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Mol Biol, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dallas, TX 75390 USA","Ting, JPY (reprint author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Microbiol Immunol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",jenny_ting@med.unc.edu,"Chen, Zhijian/C-6039-2012","Lei, Yu/0000-0002-9868-9824; Bergstralh, Dan/0000-0003-1689-3715",,,,25,300,314,4,26,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,31-Jan,2008,451,7178,,,,,573,U8,,10.1038/nature06501,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,256OQ,WOS:000252739900042,18200010.0,No,,,11/20/17,jenny p-y.,ting,na,na,na,na,na

AMP- activated protein kinase ( AMPK) orchestrates the regulation of energy- generating and - consuming pathways, and protects the heart against ischaemic injury and apoptosis(1). A role for circulating hormones such as adiponectin(2) and leptin(3) in the activation of AMPK has received recent attention. Whether local autocrine and paracrine factors within target organs such as the heart modulate AMPK is unknown. Here we show that macrophage migration inhibitory factor ( MIF), an upstream regulator of inflammation(4), is released in the ischaemic heart, where it stimulates AMPK activation through CD74, promotes glucose uptake and protects the heart during ischaemia- reperfusion injury. Germline deletion of the Mif gene impairs ischaemic AMPK signalling in the mouse heart. Human fibroblasts with a low- activity MIF promoter polymorphism(5) have diminished MIF release and AMPK activation during hypoxia. Thus, MIF modulates the activation of the cardioprotective AMPK pathway during ischaemia, functionally linking inflammation and metabolism in the heart. We anticipate that genetic variation in MIF expression may impact on the response of the human heart to ischaemia by the AMPK pathway, and that diagnostic MIF genotyping might predict risk in patients with coronary artery disease.","[Miller, Edward J.; Li, Ji; Young, Lawrence H.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, Cardiovasc Med Sect, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Leng, Lin; McDonald, Courtney; Bucala, Richard] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, Rheumatol Sect, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Bucala, Richard] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Young, Lawrence H.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cellular & Mol Physiol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Atsumi, Toshiya] Hokkaido Univ, Dept Med 2, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608638, Japan","Young, LH (reprint author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, Cardiovasc Med Sect, 333 Cedar St, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",lawrence.young@yale.edu,,"Miller, Edward/0000-0002-2156-5962",,,,32,227,235,0,28,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,31-Jan,2008,451,7178,,,,,578,U9,,10.1038/nature06504,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,256OQ,WOS:000252739900043,18235500.0,No,,,11/20/17,lawrence h.,young,na,na,na,na,na

The tumour suppressor p53 represents the first non- histone substrate functionally regulated by acetylation and deacetylation(16,17); we and others previously found that SIRT1 promotes cell survival by deacetylating p53 ( refs 4-6). These results were further supported by the fact that p53 hyperacetylation and increased radiation- induced apoptosis were observed in Sirt1- deficient mice(10). Nevertheless, SIRT1-mediated deacetylase function is also implicated in p53- independent pathways under different cellular contexts, and its effects on transcriptional factors such as members of the FOXO family and PGC-1 alpha directly modulate metabolic responses(1-15). These studies validate the importance of the deacetylase activity of SIRT1, but how SIRT1 activity is regulated in vivo is not well understood. Here we show that DBC1 ( deleted in breast cancer 1) acts as a native inhibitor of SIRT1 in human cells. DBC1- mediated repression of SIRT1 leads to increasing levels of p53 acetylation and upregulation of p53-mediated function. In contrast, depletion of endogenous DBC1 by RNA interference ( RNAi) stimulates SIRT1- mediated deacetylation of p53 and inhibits p53- dependent apoptosis. Notably, these effects can be reversed in cells by concomitant knockdown of endogenous SIRT1. Our study demonstrates that DBC1 promotes p53- mediated apoptosis through specific inhibition of SIRT1.","[Zhao, Wenhui; Kruse, Jan-Philipp; Tang, Yi; Gu, Wei] Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, Inst Canc Genet, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Zhao, Wenhui; Kruse, Jan-Philipp; Tang, Yi; Gu, Wei] Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Jung, Sung Yun; Qin, Jun] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Biochem, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Jung, Sung Yun; Qin, Jun] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Cell Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Gu, W (reprint author), Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, Inst Canc Genet, 1130 St Nicholas Ave, New York, NY 10032 USA.",wg8@columbia.edu,,"Jung, Sung Yun/0000-0003-1521-7977","NCI NIH HHS [R01 CA098821, R01 CA085533, R01 CA098821-06A1]",,,31,294,309,0,28,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,31-Jan,2008,451,7178,,,,,587,U11,,10.1038/nature06515,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,256OQ,WOS:000252739900045,18235502.0,No,,,11/20/17,wei,gu,female,0.54,203,na,na

The low pH of an endosome activates the M2 channel before haemagglutinin-mediated fusion. Conductance of protons acidifies the viral interior and thereby facilitates dissociation of the matrix protein from the viral nucleoproteins - a required process for unpacking of the viral genome(2). In addition to its role in release of viral nucleoproteins, M2 in the trans- Golgi network ( TGN) membrane prevents premature conformational rearrangement of newly synthesized haemagglutinin during transport to the cell surface by equilibrating the pH of the TGN with that of the host cell cytoplasm(3). Inhibiting the proton conductance of M2 using the anti- viral drug amantadine or rimantadine inhibits viral replication(4-7). Here we present the structure of the tetrameric M2 channel in complex with rimantadine, determined by NMR. In the closed state, four tightly packed transmembrane helices define a narrow channel, in which a 'tryptophan gate' is locked by intermolecular interactions with aspartic acid. A carboxy- terminal, amphipathic helix oriented nearly perpendicular to the transmembrane helix forms an inward- facing base. Lowering the pH destabilizes the transmembrane helical packing and unlocks the gate, admitting water to conduct protons, whereas the C- terminal base remains intact, preventing dissociation of the tetramer. Rimantadine binds at four equivalent sites near the gate on the lipid- facing side of the channel and stabilizes the closed conformation of the pore. Drug-resistance mutations are predicted to counter the effect of drug binding by either increasing the hydrophilicity of the pore or weakening helix - helix packing, thus facilitating channel opening.","[Schnell, Jason R.; Chou, James J.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem & Mol Pharmacol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Chou, JJ (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem & Mol Pharmacol, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",james_chou@hms.harvard.edu,"Chou, James/N-9840-2013",,"NIAID NIH HHS [R01 AI067438-01A1, R01 AI067438-02, R01 AI067438-03, R01 AI067438]",,,39,670,688,11,187,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,31-Jan,2008,451,7178,,,,,591,U12,,10.1038/nature06531,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,256OQ,WOS:000252739900046,18235503.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,james j.,chou,na,na,na,na,na

This antiviral activity can be constitutively expressed or induced by interferon-alpha, and it consists of protein- based tethers, which we term 'tetherins', that cause retention of fully formed virions on infected cell surfaces. Using deductive constraints and gene expression analyses, we identify CD317 ( also called BST2 or HM1.24), a membrane protein of previously unknown function, as a tetherin. Specifically, CD317 expression correlated with, and induced, a requirement for Vpu during HIV- 1 and murine leukaemia virus particle release. Furthermore, in cells where HIV- 1 virion release requires Vpu expression, depletion of CD317 abolished this requirement. CD317 caused retention of virions on cell surfaces and, after endocytosis, in CD317- positive compartments. Vpu co- localized with CD317 and inhibited these effects. Inhibition of Vpu function and consequent mobilization of tetherin's antiviral activity is a potential therapeutic strategy in HIV/AIDS.","[Neil, Stuart J.

CENP- B homologues of S. pombe localize at and recruit histone deacetylases to silence Tf2 retrotransposons. CENP- Bs also repress solo long terminal repeats ( LTRs) and LTR- associated genes. Tf2 elements are clustered into 'Tf' bodies, the organization of which depends on CENP- Bs that display discrete nuclear structures. Furthermore, CENP- Bs prevent an 'extinct' Tf1 retrotransposon from re- entering the host genome by blocking its recombination with extant Tf2, and silence and immobilize a Tf1 integrant that becomes sequestered into Tf bodies.

Several observations(1) and in situ measurements(4) found intense winds at a depth of 24 bar, and have been interpreted as supporting an internal heat source. This issue remains controversial(5), in part because of effects from the local meteorology(6).

For an electron trapped in a semiconductor quantum dot, strong quantum confinement highly suppresses the detrimental effect of phonon- related spin relaxation(1-7). However, this advantage is offset by the hyperfine interaction between the electron spin and the 10(4) to 10(6) spins of the host nuclei in the quantum dot. Random fluctuations in the nuclear spin ensemble lead to fast spin decoherence in about ten nanoseconds(8-14). Spin- echo techniques have been used to mitigate the hyperfine interaction(14,15), but completely cancelling the effect is more attractive. In principle, polarizing all the nuclear spins can achieve this(16,17) but is very difficult to realize in practice(12,18,19). Exploring materials with zero- spin nuclei is another option, and carbon nanotubes(20), graphene quantum dots(21) and silicon have been proposed. An alternative is to use a semiconductor hole. Unlike an electron, a valence hole in a quantum dot has an atomic p orbital which conveniently goes to zero at the location of all the nuclei, massively suppressing the interaction with the nuclear spins. Furthermore, in a quantum dot with strong strain and strong quantization, the heavy hole with spin- 3/2 behaves as a spin-1/2 system and spin decoherence mechanisms are weak(22,23). We demonstrate here high fidelity ( about 99 per cent) initialization of a single hole spin confined to a self- assembled quantum dot by optical pumping. Our scheme works even at zero magnetic field, demonstrating a negligible hole spin hyperfine interaction. We determine a hole spin relaxation time at low field of about one millisecond. These results suggest a route to the realization of solid- state quantum networks(24) that can intra- convert the spin state with the polarization of a photon.","[Gerardot, Brian D.; Brunner, Daniel; Dalgarno, Paul A.; Ohberg, Patrik; Warburton, Richard J.] Heriot Watt Univ, Sch Engn & Phys Sci, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland; [Seidl, Stefan; Kroner, Martin; Karrai, Khaled] Univ Munich, Ctr Nanosci, D-90539 Munich, Germany; [Seidl, Stefan; Kroner, Martin; Karrai, Khaled] Univ Munich, Dept Phys, D-90539 Munich, Germany; [Stoltz, Nick G.; Petroff, Pierre M.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Mat, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Gerardot, BD (reprint author), Heriot Watt Univ, Sch Engn & Phys Sci, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland.",b.d.gerardot@hw.ac.uk; r.j.warburton@hw.ac.uk,"Gerardot, Brian/D-2418-2009; Dalgarno, Paul/A-4065-2010; Brunner, Daniel/J-3460-2012; Ohberg, Patrik/C-8926-2013","Brunner, Daniel/0000-0002-4003-3056; Ohberg, Patrik/0000-0002-8780-4233; Dalgarno, Paul/0000-0001-7701-373X; Gerardot, Brian/0000-0002-0279-898X",,,,30,267,269,6,105,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Jan,2008,451,7177,,,,,441,444,,10.1038/nature06472,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,253YS,WOS:000252554100039,18216849.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,richard j.,warburton,na,na,na,na,na

Here we present a computational study showing that high pressure fundamentally alters the reactivity of the light elements lithium ( Li) and beryllium ( Be), which are the first of the metals in the condensed state and immiscible under normal conditions(4,5). We identify four stoichiometric LixBe1-x compounds that are stable over a range of pressures, and find that the electronic density of states of one of them displays a remarkable step-like feature near the bottom of the valence band and then remains almost constant with increasing energy. These characteristics are typical of a quasi- two- dimensional electronic structure, the emergence of which in a three- dimensional environment is rather unexpected. We attribute this observation to large size differences between the ionic cores of Li and Be: as the density increases, the Li cores start to overlap and thereby expel valence electrons into quasi- two- dimensional layers characterized by delocalized free- particle- like states in the vicinity of Be ions.","[Ashcroft, N.

For most rivers, the majority of dissolved inorganic carbon is in the form of bicarbonate. The riverine bicarbonate flux originates mainly from the dissolution of rock minerals by soil water carbon dioxide, a process called chemical weathering, which controls the buffering capacity and mineral content of receiving streams and rivers(2). Here we introduce an unprecedented high- temporal- resolution, 100- year data set from the Mississippi River and couple it with sub- watershed and precipitation data to reveal that the large increase in bicarbonate flux that has occurred over the past 50 years ( ref. 3) is clearly anthropogenically driven. We show that the increase in bicarbonate and water fluxes is caused mainly by an increase in discharge from agricultural watersheds that has not been balanced by a rise in precipitation, which is also relevant to nutrient and pesticide fluxes to the Gulf of Mexico. These findings demonstrate that alterations in chemical weathering are relevant to improving contemporary biogeochemical budgets. Furthermore, land use change and management were arguably more important than changes in climate and plant CO2 fertilization to increases in riverine water and carbon export from this large region over the past 50 years.","[Raymond, Peter A.; Oh, Neung-Hwan] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Turner, R.

This endogenous cluster formation at a critical state is a unique example of an insect population forming a non- random pattern at a large spatial scale.

Small changes in numbers of stem cells may lead to large differences in differentiated cell numbers, resulting in significant physiological consequences. Proliferation is typically regulated in the G1 phase, which is associated with differentiation and cell cycle arrest(1). However, embryonic stem ( ES) cells may lack a G1 checkpoint(2,3). Regulation of proliferation in the 'DNA damage' S/G2 cell cycle checkpoint pathway is known for its role in the maintenance of chromatin structural integrity(4). Here we show that autocrine/paracrine gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA) signalling by means of GABA(A) receptors negatively controls ES cell and peripheral neural crest stem ( NCS) cell proliferation, preimplantation embryonic growth and proliferation in the boundary- cap stem cell niche, resulting in an attenuation of neuronal progenies from this stem cell niche. Activation of GABA(A) receptors leads to hyperpolarization, increased cell volume and accumulation of stem cells in S phase, thereby causing a rapid decrease in cell proliferation. GABA(A) receptors signal through S- phase checkpoint kinases of the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase- related kinase family and the histone variant H2AX. This signalling pathway critically regulates proliferation independently of differentiation, apoptosis and overt damage to DNA. These results indicate the presence of a fundamentally different mechanism of proliferation control in these stem cells, in comparison with most somatic cells, involving proteins in the DNA damage checkpoint pathway.","[Andang, Michael; Hjerling-Leffler, Jens; Lundgren, T.

Processes of retinal interneurons ( amacrine and bipolar cells) form synapses on dendrites of RGCs in the inner plexiform layer ( IPL). The IPL is divided into at least 10 parallel sublaminae; subsets of interneurons and RGCs arborize and form synapses in just one or a few of them(1-3). These lamina- specific circuits determine the visual features to which RGC subtypes respond(3-5). Here we show that four closely related immunoglobulin superfamily ( IgSF) adhesion molecules - Dscam ( Down's syndrome cell adhesion molecule), DscamL ( refs 6 - 9), Sidekick- 1 and Sidekick- 2 ( ref. 10) - are expressed in chick by non- overlapping subsets of interneurons and RGCs that form synapses in distinct IPL sublaminae. Moreover, each protein is concentrated within the appropriate sublaminae and each mediates homophilic adhesion. Loss- and gain- of- function studies in vivo indicate that these IgSF members participate in determining the IPL sublaminae in which synaptic partners arborize and connect. Thus, vertebrate Dscams, like Drosophila Dscams(11-19), play roles in neural connectivity. Together, our results on Dscams and Sidekicks suggest the existence of an IgSF code for laminar specificity in retina and, by implication, in other parts of the central nervous system.","[Yamagata, Masahito; Sanes, Joshua R.] Harvard Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Yamagata, Masahito; Sanes, Joshua R.] Harvard Univ, Ctr Brain Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Sanes, JR (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",sanesj@mcb.harvard.edu,"Yamagata, Masahito/H-6695-2016","Yamagata, Masahito/0000-0001-8193-2931",,,,33,227,233,2,17,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,24-Jan,2008,451,7177,,,,,465,U6,,10.1038/nature06469,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,253YS,WOS:000252554100045,18216854.0,No,,,11/20/17,joshua r.,sanes,na,na,na,na,na

The mosaic patterns of distinct cell types form independently and overlap. The cues that direct these processes in the vertebrate retina are not known(2,3). Here we show that some types of retinal amacrine cells from mice with a spontaneous mutation in Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule ( Dscam), a gene encoding an immunoglobulin- superfamily member adhesion molecule(4,5), have defects in the arborization of processes and in the spacing of cell bodies. In the mutant retina, cells that would normally express Dscam have hyperfasciculated processes, preventing them from creating an orderly arbor. Also, their cell bodies are randomly distributed or pulled into clumps rather than being regularly spaced mosaics. Our results indicate that mouse DSCAM mediates isoneuronal self- avoidance for arborization and heteroneuronal self- avoidance within specific cell types to prevent fasciculation and to preserve mosaic spacing. These functions are analogous to those of Drosophila DSCAM ( ref. 6) and DSCAM2 ( ref. 7).

GA induces degradation of DELLA proteins via the ubiquitin/ proteasome pathway(2), but light promotes accumulation of DELLA proteins by reducing GA levels(3). It was proposed that DELLA proteins restrain plant growth largely through their effect on gene expression(4,5). However, the precise mechanism of their function in coordinating GA signalling and gene expression remains unknown. Here we characterize a nuclear protein interaction cascade mediating transduction of GA signals to the activity regulation of a light- responsive transcription factor. In the absence of GA, nuclear- localized DELLA proteins accumulate to higher levels, interact with phytochrome- interacting factor 3 ( PIF3, a bHLH- type transcription factor) and prevent PIF3 from binding to its target gene promoters and regulating gene expression, and therefore abrogate PIF3- mediated light control of hypocotyl elongation. In the presence of GA, GID1 proteins ( GA receptors) elevate their direct interaction with DELLA proteins in the nucleus, trigger DELLA protein's ubiquitination and proteasome- mediated degradation, and thus release PIF3 from the negative effect of DELLA proteins.","[Feng, Suhua; Martinez, Cristina; Gusmaroli, Giuliana; Deng, Xing Wang] Yale Univ, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Feng, Suhua; Zhou, Junli; Wang, Feng; Chen, Liying; Yu, Lu; Deng, Xing Wang] Natl Inst Biol Sci, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yu; Fan, Liu-Min; Deng, Xing Wang] Peking Univ, Coll Life Sci, Peking Yale Joint Ctr Plant Mol Genet & Agrobiote, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yu; Fan, Liu-Min; Deng, Xing Wang] Peking Univ, Coll Life Sci, Natl Lab Prot Engn & Plant Genet Engn, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Iglesias-Pedraz, Juan M.] CSIC, Ctr Nacl Biotecnol, Dept Genet Mol Plantas, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Kircher, Stefan; Schaefer, Eberhard] Univ Freiburg, Inst Biol Bot 2, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Fu, Xiangdong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Genet & Dev Biol, Beijing 100080, Peoples R China","Deng, XW (reprint author), Yale Univ, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",xingwang.deng@yale.edu,"Martinez Hernandez, Cristina/L-1703-2014","Martinez Hernandez, Cristina/0000-0001-7061-062X; Iglesias Pedraz, Juan Manuel/0000-0003-0070-8116","NIGMS NIH HHS [R37 GM047850, R37 GM047850-17, R01 GM047850-12, R01 GM047850]",,,32,451,502,13,170,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Jan,2008,451,7177,,,,,475,U9,,10.1038/nature06448,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,253YS,WOS:000252554100047,18216856.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,xing wang,deng,na,na,na,na,na

The mechanism underlying this antagonistic interaction remains unclear. Here we report on the central role of the Arabidopsis thaliana nuclear transcription factor PIF4 ( encoded by PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 4)(3) in the positive control of genes mediating cell elongation and show that this factor is negatively regulated by the light photoreceptor phyB ( ref. 4) and by DELLA proteins that have a key repressor function in GA signalling(5). Our results demonstrate that PIF4 is destabilized by phyB in the light and that DELLAs block PIF4 transcriptional activity by binding the DNA- recognition domain of this factor. We show that GAs abrogate such repression by promoting DELLA destabilization, and therefore cause a concomitant accumulation of free PIF4 in the nucleus. Consistent with this model, intermediate hypocotyl lengths were observed in transgenic plants over- accumulating both DELLAs and PIF4. Destabilization of this factor by phyB, together with its inactivation by DELLAs, constitutes a protein interaction framework that explains how plants integrate both light and GA signals to optimize growth and development in response to changing environments.","[de Lucas, Miguel; Daviere, Jean-Michel; Rodriguez-Falcon, Mariana; Pontin, Mariela; Iglesias-Pedraz, Juan Manuel; Titarenko, Elena; Prat, Salome] CSIC, Ctr Nacl Biotecnol, Dept Genet Mol Plantas, Madrid 28049, Spain; [Lorrain, Severine; Fankhauser, Christian] Univ Lausanne, Ctr Integrat Genom, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Blazquez, Miguel Angel] Univ Politecn Valencia, CSIC, Inst Biol Mol & Celular Plantas, Valencia 46022, Spain","Prat, S (reprint author), CSIC, Ctr Nacl Biotecnol, Dept Genet Mol Plantas, Campus Univ Autonoma Madrid,C Darwin 3, Madrid 28049, Spain.",sprat@cnb.uam.es,"Blazquez, Miguel/B-1495-2008; Prat, Salome/L-9240-2014","Blazquez, Miguel/0000-0001-5743-0448; Prat, Salome/0000-0003-2684-5485; Iglesias Pedraz, Juan Manuel/0000-0003-0070-8116; De Lucas, Miguel/0000-0002-6544-6404; Fankhauser, Christian/0000-0003-4719-5901",,,,36,506,517,9,158,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Jan,2008,451,7177,,,,,480,U11,,10.1038/nature06520,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,253YS,WOS:000252554100048,18216857.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,salome,prat,female,1,41,na,na

For construction of the bacterial flagellum responsible for motility, most of the components are exported by the flagellar protein export apparatus(1,2). The FliI ATPase is required for this export(3), and its ATPase activity is regulated by FliH(4); however, it is unclear how the chemical energy derived from ATP hydrolysis is used for the export process. Here we report that flagellar proteins of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium are exported even in the absence of FliI. A fliH fliI double null mutant was weakly motile. Certain mutations in FlhA or FlhB, which form the core of the export gate, substantially improved protein export and motility of the double null mutant. Furthermore, proton motive force was essential for the export process. These results suggest that the FliH - FliI complex facilitates only the initial entry of export substrates into the gate, with the energy of ATP hydrolysis being used to disassemble and release the FliH - FliI complex from the protein about to be exported. The rest of the successive unfolding/ translocation process of the substrates is driven by proton motive force.","[Minamino, Tohru; Namba, Keiichi] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Frontier Biosci, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Minamino, Tohru; Namba, Keiichi] JST, ICORP, Dynam NanoMachine Project, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan","Namba, K (reprint author), Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Frontier Biosci, 1-3 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan.",keiichi@fbs.osaka-u.ac.jp,"Namba, Keiichi/A-9406-2016",,,,,34,150,150,0,11,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Jan,2008,451,7177,,,,,485,U12,,10.1038/nature06449,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,253YS,WOS:000252554100049,18216858.0,No,,,11/20/17,keiichi,namba,male,1,4,na,na

This apparatus is related to the injectisome used by many gram- negative pathogens and symbionts to transfer effector proteins into host cells; in both systems this export mechanism is termed 'type III' secretion(2,3). The flagellar secretion apparatus comprises a membrane- embedded complex of about five proteins, and soluble factors, which include export- dedicated chaperones and an ATPase, FliI, that was thought to provide the energy for export(1,4). Here we show that flagellar secretion in Salmonella enterica requires the proton motive force ( PMF) and does not require ATP hydrolysis by FliI. The export of several flagellar export substrates was prevented by treatment with the protonophore CCCP, with no accompanying decrease in cellular ATP levels. Weak swarming motility and rare flagella were observed in a mutant deleted for FliI and for the non-flagellar type- III secretion ATPases InvJ and SsaN. These findings show that the flagellar secretion apparatus functions as a proton-driven protein exporter and that ATP hydrolysis is not essential for type III secretion.","[Paul, Koushik; Erhardt, Marc; Hirano, Takanori; Blair, David F.; Hughes, Kelly T.] Univ Utah, Dept Biol, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA","Blair, DF (reprint author), Univ Utah, Dept Biol, 257 South 1400 East, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",blair@bioscience.utah.edu; hughes@biology.utah.edu,,"Erhardt, Marc/0000-0001-6292-619X",,,,27,161,162,1,12,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,24-Jan,2008,451,7177,,,,,489,U13,,10.1038/nature06497,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,253YS,WOS:000252554100050,18216859.0,No,,,11/20/17,kelly t.,hughes,na,na,na,na,na

One idea is that this correspondence is established at the level of single neurons that are active when the individual performs a particular gesture or observes a similar gesture performed by another individual. Although neurons that display a precise auditory- vocal correspondence could facilitate vocal communication, they have yet to be identified. Here we report that a certain class of neurons in the swamp sparrow forebrain displays a precise auditory- vocal correspondence. We show that these neurons respond in a temporally precise fashion to auditory presentation of certain note sequences in this songbird's repertoire and to similar note sequences in other birds' songs. These neurons display nearly identical patterns of activity when the bird sings the same sequence, and disrupting auditory feedback does not alter this singing- related activity, indicating it is motor in nature. Furthermore, these neurons innervate striatal structures important for song learning, raising the possibility that singing- related activity in these cells is compared to auditory feedback to guide vocal learning.","[Prather, J.

It arises when quantum interference takes place between two competing optical pathways, one connecting the energy ground state and an excited discrete state, the other connecting the ground state with a continuum of energy states. The nature of the interference changes rapidly as a function of energy, giving rise to characteristically asymmetric lineshapes. The Fano effect is particularly important in the interpretation of electronic transport(5,6) and optical spectra(7,8) in semiconductors. Whereas Fano's original theory(1) applies to the linear regime at low power, at higher power a laser field strongly admixes the states and the physics becomes rich, leading, for example, to a remarkable interplay of coherent nonlinear transitions(9). Despite the general importance of Fano physics, this nonlinear regime has received very little attention experimentally, presumably because the classic autoionization processes(2), the original test-bed of Fano's ideas(1), occur in an inconvenient spectral region, the deep ultraviolet. Here we report experiments that access the nonlinear Fano regime by using semiconductor quantum dots, which allow both the continuum states to be engineered and the energies to be rescaled to the near infrared. We measure the absorption cross- section of a single quantum dot and discover clear Fano resonances that we can tune with the device design or even in situ with a voltage bias. In parallel, we develop a nonlinear theory applicable to solid- state systems with fast relaxation of carriers. In the nonlinear regime, the visibility of the Fano quantum interferences increases dramatically, affording a sensitive probe of continuum coupling. This could be a unique method to detect weak couplings of a two- level quantum system ( qubits), which should ideally be decoupled from all other states.","[Govorov, A.

Its solubility renders this species a problematic contaminant(1-3) which is, moreover, chemically extraordinarily robust owing to strongly covalent U-O bonds(4). This feature manifests itself in the uranyl dication showing little propensity to partake in the many oxo group functionalizations and redox reactions typically seen with [CrO2](2+), [MoO2](2+) and other transition metal analogues(5-9). As a result, only a few examples of [UO2](2+) with functionalized oxo groups are known. Similarly, it is only very recently that the isolation and characterization of the singly reduced, pentavalent uranyl cation [UO2](+) has been reported(10-12). Here we show that placing the uranyl dication within a rigid and well-defined molecular framework while keeping the environment anaerobic allows simultaneous single- electron reduction and selective covalent bond formation at one of the two uranyl oxo groups. The product of this reaction is a pentavalent and monofunctionalized [O = U = OR](+) cation that can be isolated in the presence of transition metal cations. This finding demonstrates that under appropriate reaction conditions, the uranyl oxo group will readily undergo radical reactions commonly associated only with transition metal oxo groups. We expect that this work might also prove useful in probing the chemistry of the related but highly radioactive plutonyl and neptunyl analogues found in nuclear waste.","[Arnold, Polly L.; Patel, Dipti; Love, Jason B.] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Chem, Edinburgh EH9 3JJ, Midlothian, Scotland; [Wilson, Claire] Rigaku Europe, Sevenoaks TN15 6QY, Kent, England","Arnold, PL (reprint author), Univ Edinburgh, Sch Chem, W Mains Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3JJ, Midlothian, Scotland.",Polly.Arnold@ed.ac.uk; Jason.Love@ed.ac.uk,"Arnold, Polly/E-6229-2011","Arnold, Polly/0000-0001-6410-5838",,,,30,180,181,10,60,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Jan,2008,451,7176,,,,,315,U3,,10.1038/nature06467,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,252FJ,WOS:000252432100045,18202653.0,No,,,11/20/17,jason b.,love,na,na,na,na,na

To design systems that perform dynamic functions without human intervention, it is necessary to encode within the biopolymer sequences the reaction pathways by which self- assembly occurs. Nucleic acids show promise as a design medium for engineering dynamic functions, including catalytic hybridization(3-6), triggered self- assembly(7) and molecular computation(8,9). Here, we program diverse molecular self- assembly and disassembly pathways using a 'reaction graph' abstraction to specify complementarity relationships between modular domains in a versatile DNA hairpin motif.

Direct measurements in bottle experiments indicate net oxygen consumption in the sunlit zone(3-6), whereas geochemical evidence suggests that the upper ocean is a net source of oxygen(2). One possible resolution to this conflict is that primary production in the gyres is episodic(1,2,6) and thus difficult to observe: in this model, oligotrophic regions would be net consumers of oxygen during most of the year, but strong, brief events with high primary production rates might produce enough fixed carbon and dissolved oxygen to yield net production as an average over the annual cycle. Here we examine the balance of oxygen production over three years at sites in the North and South Pacific subtropical gyres using the new technique of oxygen sensors deployed on profiling floats. We find that mixing events during early winter homogenize the upper water column and cause low oxygen concentrations. Oxygen then increases below the mixed layer at a nearly constant rate that is similar to independent measures of net community production. This continuous oxygen increase is consistent with an ecosystem that is a net producer of fixed carbon ( net autotrophic) throughout the year, with episodic events not required to sustain positive oxygen production.","[Riser, Stephen C.] Univ Washington, Sch Oceanog, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Johnson, Kenneth S.] Monterey Bay Aquarium Res Inst, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA","Riser, SC (reprint author), Univ Washington, Sch Oceanog, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",riser@ocean.washington.edu; johnson@mbari.org,"Johnson, Kenneth/F-9742-2011","Johnson, Kenneth/0000-0001-5513-5584",,,,20,95,98,3,36,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Jan,2008,451,7176,,,,,323,U5,,10.1038/nature06441,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,252FJ,WOS:000252432100047,18202655.0,No,,,11/20/17,kenneth s.,johnson,na,na,na,na,na

The water content in the transition zone can be estimated from the electrical conductivities of hydrous wadsleyite and ringwoodite, although such estimates depend on accurate knowledge of the two conduction mechanisms in these minerals ( small polaron and proton conductions), which early studies have failed to distinguish between(3,4). Here we report the electrical conductivity of these two minerals obtained by high- pressure multi- anvil experiments. We found that the small polaron conductions of these minerals are substantially lower than previously estimated. The contributions of proton conduction are small at temperatures corresponding to the mantle transition zone and the conductivity of wadsleyite is considerably lower than that of ringwoodite for both mechanisms. The dry model mantle shows considerable conductivity jumps associated with the olivine- wadsleyite, wadsleyite- ringwoodite and post- spinel transitions. Such a dry model explains well the currently available conductivity- depth profiles(5) obtained from geoelectromagnetic studies.

A loss of synaptic inhibition in the spinal dorsal horn is considered to contribute significantly to this pain pathology(3-7). Facilitation of spinal gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA) ergic neurotransmission through modulation of GABA(A) receptors should be able to compensate for this loss(8,9). With the use of GABA(A)-receptor point- mutated knock- in mice in which specific GABA(A) receptor subtypes have been selectively rendered insensitive to benzodiazepine- site ligands(10-12), we show here that pronounced analgesia can be achieved by specifically targeting spinal GABA(A) receptors containing the alpha 2 and/ or alpha 3 subunits. We show that their selective activation by the non- sedative ('alpha 1- sparing') benzodiazepine- site ligand L- 838,417 ( ref. 13) is highly effective against inflammatory and neuropathic pain yet devoid of unwanted sedation, motor impairment and tolerance development. L- 838,417 not only diminished the nociceptive input to the brain but also reduced the activity of brain areas related to the associative- emotional components of pain, as shown by functional magnetic resonance imaging in rats.

One prominent example is the 5q(-) syndrome, a subtype of myelodysplastic syndrome characterized by a defect in erythroid differentiation(2). Here we describe an RNA-mediated interference ( RNAi)- based approach to discovery of the 5q(-) disease gene. We found that partial loss of function of the ribosomal subunit protein RPS14 phenocopies the disease in normal haematopoietic progenitor cells, and also that forced expression of RPS14 rescues the disease phenotype in patient- derived bone marrow cells. In addition, we identified a block in the processing of pre- ribosomal RNA in RPS14- deficient cells that is functionally equivalent to the defect in Diamond- Blackfan anaemia, linking the molecular pathophysiology of the 5q(-) syndrome to a congenital syndrome causing bone marrow failure.

Hairs are mini-organs that undergo cyclic regeneration throughout adult life(1,) and are an important model for organ regeneration. Hair stem cells located in the follicle bulge(2) are regulated by the surrounding microenvironment, or niche(3). The activation of such stem cells is cyclic, involving periodic beta-catenin activity(4-7). In the adult mouse, regeneration occurs in waves in a follicle population, implying coordination among adjacent follicles and the extrafollicular environment. Here we show that unexpected periodic expression of bone morphogenetic protein 2 ( Bmp2) and Bmp4 in the dermis regulates this process. This BMP cycle is out of phase with the WNT/beta-catenin cycle, thus dividing the conventional telogen into new functional phases: one refractory and the other competent for hair regeneration, characterized by high and low BMP signalling, respectively. Overexpression of noggin, a BMP antagonist, in mouse skin resulted in a markedly shortened refractory phase and faster propagation of the regenerative wave. Transplantation of skin from this mutant onto a wild- type host showed that follicles in donor and host can affect their cycling behaviours mutually, with the outcome depending on the equilibrium of BMP activity in the dermis. Administration of BMP4 protein caused the competent region to become refractory. These results show that BMPs may be the long- sought 'chalone' inhibitors of hair growth postulated by classical experiments. Taken together, results presented in this study provide an example of hierarchical regulation of local organ stem cell homeostasis by the inter- organ macro-environment. The expression of Bmp2 in subcutaneous adipocytes indicates physiological integration between these two thermoregulatory organs. Our findings have practical importance for studies using mouse skin as a model for carcinogenesis, intracutaneous drug delivery and stem cell engineering studies, because they highlight the acute need to differentiate supportive versus inhibitory regions in the host skin.","[Plikus, Maksim V.; Mayer, Julie Ann; de la Cruz, Damon; Chuong, Cheng-Ming] Univ So Calif, Keck Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Los Angeles, CA 90033 USA; [Baker, Ruth E.; Maini, Philip K.] Math Inst, Ctr Math Biol, Oxford OX1 3LB, England; [Maini, Philip K.] Univ Oxford, Dept Biochem, Oxford Ctr Integrat Syst Biol, Oxford OX1 3QU, England; [Maxson, Robert] Univ So Calif, Keck Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA","Chuong, CM (reprint author), Univ So Calif, Keck Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Los Angeles, CA 90033 USA.",cmchuong@usc.edu,,,"NIAMS NIH HHS [R01 AR042177-14, R01 AR042177, R01 AR042177-13, R01 AR047364, R01 AR047364-05, R01 AR047364-06]",,,30,279,294,2,49,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Jan,2008,451,7176,,,,,340,U8,,10.1038/nature06457,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,252FJ,WOS:000252432100051,18202659.0,No,,,11/20/17,cheng-ming,chuong,male,1,1,IpyHB34AAAAJ,11896

If such minority populations are associated with tumour progression in human patients, specific targeting of tumour- initiating cells could be a strategy to eradicate cancers currently resistant to systemic therapy. Here we identify a subpopulation enriched for human malignant- melanoma- initiating cells ( MMIC) defined by expression of the chemoresistance mediator ABCB5 ( refs 7, 8) and show that specific targeting of this tumorigenic minority population inhibits tumour growth. ABCB5(+) tumour cells detected in human melanoma patients show a primitive molecular phenotype and correlate with clinical melanoma progression. In serial human- to-mouse xenotransplantation experiments, ABCB5(+) melanoma cells possess greater tumorigenic capacity than ABCB5(-) bulk populations and re- establish clinical tumour heterogeneity. In vivo genetic lineage tracking demonstrates a specific capacity of ABCB5(+) sub-populations for self- renewal and differentiation, because ABCB5(+) cancer cells generate both ABCB5(+) and ABCB5(-) progeny, whereas ABCB5(-) tumour populations give rise, at lower rates, exclusively to ABCB5(-) cells. In an initial proof- of- principle analysis, designed to test the hypothesis that MMIC are also required for growth of established tumours, systemic administration of a monoclonal antibody directed at ABCB5, shown to be capable of inducing antibody- dependent cell- mediated cytotoxicity in ABCB5(+) MMIC, exerted tumour- inhibitory effects. Identification of tumour- initiating cells with enhanced abundance in more advanced disease but susceptibility to specific targeting through a defining chemoresistance determinant has important implications for cancer therapy.","[Schatton, Tobias; Frank, Natasha Y.; Yamaura, Kazuhiro; Jordan, Stefan; Sayegh, Mohamed H.; Frank, Markus H.] Childrens Hosp, Transplantat Res Ctr, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Schatton, Tobias; Murphy, George F.; Frank, Natasha Y.; Yamaura, Kazuhiro; Zhan, Qian; Jordan, Stefan; Sayegh, Mohamed H.; Frank, Markus H.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Frank, Natasha Y.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Waaga-Gasser, Ana Maria; Gasser, Martin] Univ Wurzburg, Dept Surg, D-97080 Wurzburg, Germany; [Duncan, Lyn M.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Weishaupt, Carsten; Fuhlbrigge, Robert C.; Kupper, Thomas S.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Dermatol, Harvard Skin Dis Res Ctr, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Frank, MH (reprint author), Childrens Hosp, Transplantat Res Ctr, 300 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",mfrank@rics.bwh.harvard.edu,"Jordan, Stefan/G-6243-2011","Jordan, Stefan/0000-0001-9330-1715; Frank, Markus/0000-0002-1312-0488","NCI NIH HHS [R01 CA113796-01A1, R01 CA113796]; NHLBI NIH HHS [R01 HL084815, R01 HL084815-17]; NIAMS NIH HHS [P30 AR042689, P30 AR042689-159006]; NINDS NIH HHS [K08 NS051349]",,,30,831,873,4,40,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Jan,2008,451,7176,,,,,345,U11,,10.1038/nature06489,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,252FJ,WOS:000252432100052,18202660.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,markus h.,frank,na,na,na,na,na

Surprisingly, these bacteria were found to occupy vacuoles in liver granuloma macrophages during persistent infection of severe combined immunodeficient ( SCID) mice(2). Here we show that L. monocytogenes can replicate in vacuoles within macrophages. In livers of SCID mice infected for 21 days, we observed bacteria in large LAMP1(+) compartments that we termed spacious Listeria- containing phagosomes ( SLAPs). SLAPs were also observed in vitro, and were found to be non- acidic and non-degradative compartments that are generated in an autophagy-dependent manner. The replication rate of bacteria in SLAPs was found to be reduced compared to the rate of those in the cytosol. Listeriolysin O ( LLO, encoded by hly), a pore- forming toxin essential for L. monocytogenes virulence(1), was necessary and sufficient for SLAP formation. A L. monocytogenes mutant with low LLO expression was impaired for phagosome escape but replicated slowly in SLAPs over a 72 h period. Therefore, our studies reveal a role for LLO in promoting L. monocytogenes replication in vacuoles and suggest a mechanism by which this pathogen can establish persistent infection in host macrophages.","[Birmingham, Cheryl L.; Canadien, Veronica; Kaniuk, Natalia A.; Steinberg, Benjamin E.; Brumell, John H.] Hosp Sick Children, Cell Biol Program, Toronto, ON M5G 1X8, Canada; [Birmingham, Cheryl L.; Brumell, John H.] Univ Toronto, Dept Mol Genet, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [Steinberg, Benjamin E.; Brumell, John H.] Univ Toronto, Inst Med Sci, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [Higgins, Darren E.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Mol Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Brumell, JH (reprint author), Hosp Sick Children, Cell Biol Program, 555 Univ Ave, Toronto, ON M5G 1X8, Canada.",john.brumell@sickkids.ca,,,,,,32,155,162,1,22,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Jan,2008,451,7176,,,,,350,U13,,10.1038/nature06749,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,252FJ,WOS:000252432100053,18202661.0,No,,,11/20/17,john h.,brumell,na,na,na,na,na

This modification creates better substrates for the endonuclease RNase E, whose cleavage activity at internal sites is greatly enhanced when the RNA 5' end is monophosphorylated(2,3). Moreover, it suggests an explanation for the influence of 5' termini on the endonucleolytic cleavage of primary transcripts, which are triphosphorylated(4-) (8). However, no enzyme capable of removing pyrophosphate from RNA 5' ends has been identified in any bacterial species. Here we show that the E. coli protein RppH ( formerly NudH/Y gdP) is the RNA pyrophosphohydrolase that initiates mRNA decay by this 5'- end- dependent pathway. In vitro, RppH efficiently removes pyrophosphate from the 5' end of triphosphorylated RNA, irrespective of the identity of the 5'- terminal nucleotide. In vivo, it accelerates the degradation of hundreds of E. coli transcripts by converting their triphosphorylated 5' ends to a more labile mono-phosphorylated state that can stimulate subsequent ribonuclease cleavage. That the action of the pyrophosphohydrolase is impeded when the 5' end is structurally sequestered by a stem- loop helps to explain the stabilizing influence of 5'- terminal base pairing on mRNA lifetimes. Together, these findings suggest a possible basis for the effect of RppH and its orthologues on the invasiveness of bacterial pathogens. Interestingly, this master regulator of 5'- end-dependent mRNA degradation in E. coli not only catalyses a process functionally reminiscent of eukaryotic mRNA decapping but also bears an evolutionary relationship to the eukaryotic decapping enzyme Dcp2.","[Deana, Atilio; Celesnik, Helena; Belasco, Joel G.] NYU, Sch Med, Skirball Inst, Kimmel Ctr Biol & Med, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Deana, Atilio; Celesnik, Helena; Belasco, Joel G.] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol, New York, NY 10016 USA","Belasco, JG (reprint author), NYU, Sch Med, Skirball Inst, Kimmel Ctr Biol & Med, New York, NY 10016 USA.",belasco@saturn.med.nyu.edu,,,NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM035769],,,31,221,223,2,24,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Jan,2008,451,7176,,,,,355,U14,,10.1038/nature06475,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,252FJ,WOS:000252432100054,18202662.0,No,,,11/20/17,joel g.,belasco,na,na,na,na,na

Splicing is guided locally by short conserved sequences, but genes typically contain many potential splice sites, and the mechanisms specifying the correct sites remain poorly understood. In most organisms, short introns recognized by the intron definition mechanism(2) cannot be efficiently predicted solely on the basis of sequence motifs(3). In multicellular eukaryotes, long introns are recognized through exon definition(2) and most genes produce multiple mRNA variants through alternative splicing(4). The nonsense- mediated mRNA decay(5,6) ( NMD) pathway may further shape the observed sets of variants by selectively degrading those containing premature termination codons, which are frequently produced in mammals(7,8). Here we show that the tiny introns of the ciliate Paramecium tetraurelia are under strong selective pressure to cause premature termination of mRNA translation in the event of intron retention, and that the same bias is observed among the short introns of plants, fungi and animals. By knocking down the two P. tetraurelia genes encoding UPF1, a protein that is crucial in NMD, we show that the intrinsic efficiency of splicing varies widely among introns and that NMD activity can significantly reduce the fraction of unspliced mRNAs. The results suggest that, independently of alternative splicing, species with large intron numbers universally rely on NMD to compensate for suboptimal splicing efficiency and accuracy.","[Bouhouche, Khaled; Saudemont, Baptiste; Nowacki, Mariusz; Serrano, Vincent; Le Mouel, Anne; Lepere, Gersende; Meyer, Eric] Ecole Normale Super, Genet Mol Lab, F-75005 Paris, France; [Jaillon, Olivier; Aury, Jean-Marc; Noel, Benjamin; Porcel, Betina M.; Segurens, Beatrice; Schachter, Vincent; Wincker, Patrick] Genoscope CEA, F-91057 Evry, France; [Jaillon, Olivier; Aury, Jean-Marc; Noel, Benjamin; Porcel, Betina M.; Schachter, Vincent; Wincker, Patrick] CNRS, UMR 8030, F-91057 Evry, France; [Jaillon, Olivier; Aury, Jean-Marc; Noel, Benjamin; Porcel, Betina M.; Schachter, Vincent; Wincker, Patrick] Univ Evry, F-91057 Evry, France; [Bouhouche, Khaled; Saudemont, Baptiste; Nowacki, Mariusz; Serrano, Vincent; Le Mouel, Anne; Lepere, Gersende; Meyer, Eric] CNRS, UMR 8541, F-75005 Paris, France; [Bouhouche, Khaled; Betermier, Mireille; Cohen, Jean; Sperling, Linda] CNRS, Ctr Genet Mol, UPR 2167, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Bouhouche, Khaled; Betermier, Mireille; Cohen, Jean; Sperling, Linda] Univ Paris 11, F-91405 Orsay, France; [Bouhouche, Khaled; Betermier, Mireille; Cohen, Jean; Sperling, Linda] Univ Paris 06, F-75005 Paris, France; [Gout, Jean-Francois; Duret, Laurent] Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, UMR 5558, Lab Biometrie & Biol Evolut, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France","Meyer, E (reprint author), Ecole Normale Super, Genet Mol Lab, 46 Rue Ulm, F-75005 Paris, France.",emeyer@biologie.ens.fr,"Nowacki, Mariusz/E-4485-2011; Sperling, Linda/C-9734-2014","Nowacki, Mariusz/0000-0003-4894-2905; Duret, Laurent/0000-0003-2836-3463; AURY, Jean-Marc/0000-0003-1718-3010; lepere, gersende/0000-0002-4609-7587; Sperling, Linda/0000-0002-7772-4774; Meyer, Eric/0000-0002-3161-8597",,,,39,123,126,0,20,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Jan,2008,451,7176,,,,,359,U15,,10.1038/nature06495,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,252FJ,WOS:000252432100055,18202663.0,No,,,11/20/17,eric,meyer,male,1,4110,2AvG0z0AAAAJ,1784

The mechanism by which spastin and katanin break and destabilize microtubules is unknown, in part owing to the lack of structural information on these enzymes. Here we report the X- ray crystal structure of the Drosophila spastin AAA domain and provide a model for the active spastin hexamer generated using small- angle X- ray scattering combined with atomic docking. The spastin hexamer forms a ring with a prominent central pore and six radiating arms that may dock onto the microtubule. Helices unique to the microtubule- severing AAA ATPases surround the entrances to the pore on either side of the ring, and three highly conserved loops line the pore lumen. Mutagenesis reveals essential roles for these structural elements in the severing reaction. Peptide and antibody inhibition experiments further show that spastin may dismantle microtubules by recognizing specific features in the carboxy- terminal tail of tubulin. Collectively, our data support a model in which spastin pulls the C terminus of tubulin through its central pore, generating a mechanical force that destabilizes tubulin- tubulin interactions within the microtubule lattice. Our work also provides insights into the structural defects in spastin that arise from mutations identified in hereditary spastic paraplegia patients.","[Roll-Mecak, Antonina; Vale, Ronald D.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Roll-Mecak, Antonina; Vale, Ronald D.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Mol & Cellular Pharmacol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA","Vale, RD (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, 600 16th St, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA.",vale@cmp.ucsf.edu,,"Roll-Mecak, Antonina/0000-0003-2621-7307","Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NINDS NIH HHS [K99 NS057934-02, K99 NS057934-01]",,,34,141,147,4,25,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,17-Jan,2008,451,7176,,,,,363,U16,,10.1038/nature06482,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,252FJ,WOS:000252432100056,18202664.0,No,,,11/20/17,ronald d.,vale,na,na,na,na,na

Recently, murine fibroblasts have been reprogrammed directly to pluripotency by ectopic expression of four transcription factors ( Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and Myc) to yield induced pluripotent stem ( iPS) cells. Using these same factors, we have derived iPS cells from fetal, neonatal and adult human primary cells, including dermal fibroblasts isolated from a skin biopsy of a healthy research subject. Human iPS cells resemble embryonic stem cells in morphology and gene expression and in the capacity to form teratomas in immune- deficient mice.

Such radiation has been known for 30 years to come from the general direction of the Galactic Centre(1), but the origin of the positrons has remained a mystery. Stellar nucleosynthesis(2-4), accreting compact objects(5-8), and even the annihilation of exotic dark- matter particles(9) have all been suggested. Here we report a distinct asymmetry in the 511- keV line emission coming from the inner Galactic disk ( similar to 10-50 degrees from the Galactic Centre). This asymmetry resembles an asymmetry in the distribution of low mass X- ray binaries with strong emission at photon energies >20 keV ('hard' LMXBs), indicating that they may be the dominant origin of the positrons. Although it had long been suspected that electron - positron pair plasmas may exist in X- ray binaries, it was not evident that many of the positrons could escape to lose energy and ultimately annihilate with electrons in the interstellar medium and thus lead to the emission of a narrow 511- keV line. For these models, our result implies that up to a few times 10(41) positrons escape per second from a typical hard LMXB. Positron production at this level from hard LMXBs in the Galactic bulge would reduce ( and possibly eliminate) the need for more exotic explanations, such as those involving dark matter.","[Weidenspointner, Georg; Skinner, Gerry; Jean, Pierre; Knoedlseder, Juergen; von Ballmoos, Peter; Bignami, Giovanni] UPS, CNRS, Ctr Etud Spatiale Rayonnements, Toulouse 4, France; [Weidenspointner, Georg; Diehl, Roland; Strong, Andrew W.] Max Planck Inst Extraterr Phys, D-85741 Garching, Germany; [Weidenspointner, Georg] MPI Halbleiterlab, D-81739 Munich, Germany; [Skinner, Gerry] NASA, CRESST, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Skinner, Gerry] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Skinner, Gerry] Univ Maryland, Dept Astron, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Cordier, Bertrand; Schanne, Stephane] CEA Saclay, SAp, DAPNIA, DSM, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Winkler, Christoph] ESA, ESTEC, SCI SA, NL-2201 AZ Noordwijk, Netherlands; [Bignami, Giovanni] IUSS, I-27100 Pavia, Italy","Weidenspointner, G (reprint author), UPS, CNRS, Ctr Etud Spatiale Rayonnements, BP 44346, Toulouse 4, France.",Georg.Weidenspointner@hll.mpg.de,,"Bignami, Giovanni/0000-0001-9582-2450",,,,29,127,127,0,4,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Jan,2008,451,7175,,,,,159,162,,10.1038/nature06490,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,249GA,WOS:000252214400035,18185581.0,No,,,11/20/17,christoph,winkler,male,1,192,HIF10V0AAAAJ,3976

Thermoelectric modules could potentially convert part of this low- grade waste heat to electricity. Their efficiency depends on the thermoelectric figure of merit ZT of their material components, which is a function of the Seebeck coefficient, electrical resistivity, thermal conductivity and absolute temperature. Over the past five decades it has been challenging to increase ZT > 1, since the parameters of ZT are generally interdependent(1). While nanostructured thermoelectric materials can increase ZT > 1 ( refs 2 - 4), the materials ( Bi, Te, Pb, Sb, and Ag) and processes used are not often easy to scale to practically useful dimensions. Here we report the electrochemical synthesis of large- area, wafer- scale arrays of rough Si nanowires that are 20-300 nm in diameter. These nanowires have Seebeck coefficient and electrical resistivity values that are the same as doped bulk Si, but those with diameters of about 50 nm exhibit 100- fold reduction in thermal conductivity, yielding ZT = 0.6 at room temperature. For such nanowires, the lattice contribution to thermal conductivity approaches the amorphous limit for Si, which cannot be explained by current theories. Although bulk Si is a poor thermoelectric material, by greatly reducing thermal conductivity without much affecting the Seebeck coefficient and electrical resistivity, Si nanowire arrays show promise as high- performance, scalable thermoelectric materials.","[Chen, Renkun; Majumdar, Arun] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mech Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Hochbaum, Allon I.; Delgado, Raul Diaz; Liang, Wenjie; Garnett, Erik C.; Yang, Peidong] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Najarian, Mark; Majumdar, Arun; Yang, Peidong] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Majumdar, Arun; Yang, Peidong] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Majumdar, A (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mech Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",majumdar@me.berkeley.edu; p_yang@berkeley.edu,"Garnett, Erik/A-6847-2009; Vasilica, Andrei/F-2185-2010; Chen, Renkun/J-2400-2014","Garnett, Erik/0000-0002-9158-8326; Chen, Renkun/0000-0001-7526-4981",,,,28,2420,2440,103,1423,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Jan,2008,451,7175,,,,,163,U5,,10.1038/nature06381,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,249GA,WOS:000252214400036,18185582.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,peidong,yang,na,na,na,na,na

Thermoelectrics currently find only niche applications because of their limited efficiency, which is measured by the dimensionless parameter ZT - a function of the Seebeck coefficient or thermoelectric power, and of the electrical and thermal conductivities. Maximizing ZT is challenging because optimizing one physical parameter often adversely affects another(3). Several groups have achieved significant improvements in ZT through multi- component nanostructured thermoelectrics(4-6), such as Bi2Te3/Sb2Te3 thin- film superlattices, or embedded PbSeTe quantum dot superlattices. Here we report efficient thermoelectric performance from the single- component system of silicon nanowires for cross- sectional areas of 10 nm x 20 nm and 20 nm x 20 nm. By varying the nanowire size and impurity doping levels, ZT values representing an approximately 100- fold improvement over bulk Si are achieved over a broad temperature range, including ZT approximate to 1 at 200 K. Independent measurements of the Seebeck coefficient, the electrical conductivity and the thermal conductivity, combined with theory, indicate that the improved efficiency originates from phonon effects.

A famous example is the quantum electrodynamical Casimir force that results from zero- point vacuum fluctuations confined between two conducting metal plates(1). A thermodynamic analogue is the critical Casimir force: it acts between surfaces immersed in a binary liquid mixture close to its critical point and arises from the confinement of concentration fluctuations within the thin film of fluid separating the surfaces(2). So far, all experimental evidence for the existence of this effect has been indirect(3-5). Here we report the direct measurement of critical Casimir force between a single colloidal sphere and a flat silica surface immersed in a mixture of water and 2,6- lutidine near its critical point. We use total internal reflection microscopy to determine in situ the forces between the sphere and the surface, with femtonewton resolution(6). Depending on whether the adsorption preferences of the sphere and the surface for water and 2,6- lutidine are identical or opposite, we measure attractive and repulsive forces, respectively, that agree quantitatively with theoretical predictions and exhibit exquisite dependence on the temperature of the system.

The prevalent occurrence of biodegradation in shallow subsurface petroleum reservoirs(2,3) has been attributed to aerobic bacterial hydrocarbon degradation stimulated by surface recharge of oxygen- bearing meteoric waters(2). This hypothesis is empirically supported by the likelihood of encountering biodegraded oils at higher levels of degradation in reservoirs near the surface(4,5). More recent findings, however, suggest that anaerobic degradation processes dominate subsurface sedimentary environments(6), despite slow reaction kinetics and uncertainty as to the actual degradation pathways occurring in oil reservoirs. Here we use laboratory experiments in microcosms monitoring the hydrocarbon composition of degraded oils and generated gases, together with the carbon isotopic compositions of gas and oil samples taken at wellheads and a Rayleigh isotope fractionation box model, to elucidate the probable mechanisms of hydrocarbon degradation in reservoirs. We find that crude- oil hydrocarbon degradation under methanogenic conditions in the laboratory mimics the characteristic sequential removal of compound classes seen in reservoir- degraded petroleum. The initial preferential removal of n-alkanes generates close to stoichiometric amounts of methane, principally by hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. Our data imply a common methanogenic biodegradation mechanism in subsurface degraded oil reservoirs, resulting in consistent patterns of hydrocarbon alteration, and the common association of dry gas with severely degraded oils observed worldwide. Energy recovery from oilfields in the form of methane, based on accelerating natural methanogenic biodegradation, may offer a route to economic production of difficult- to- recover energy from oilfields.","[Jones, D.

It is commonly thought that flow in these systems is oriented across the ridge axis, with recharge occurring along off- axis faults(4-6), but the structure and scale of hydrothermal systems are usually inferred from thermal and geochemical models constrained by the geophysical setting(7-9), rather than direct observations. The presence of microearthquakes may shed light on hydrothermal pathways by revealing zones of thermal cracking where cold sea water extracts heat from hot crustal rocks, as well as regions where magmatic and tectonic stresses create fractures that increase porosity and permeability. Here we show that hypocentres beneath a well- studied hydrothermal vent field on the East Pacific Rise cluster in a vertical pipe- like zone near a small axial discontinuity, and in a band that lies directly above the axial magma chamber. The location of the shallow pipe- like cluster relative to the distribution and temperature of hydrothermal vents along this section of the ridge suggests that hydrothermal recharge may be concentrated there as a consequence of the permeability generated by tectonic fracturing. Furthermore, we interpret the band of seismicity above the magma chamber as a zone of hydrothermal cracking, which suggests that hydrothermal circulation may be strongly aligned along the ridge axis. We conclude that models that suggest that hydrothermal cells are oriented across- axis, with diffuse off- axis recharge zones, may not apply to the fast- spreading East Pacific Rise.","[Tolstoy, M.; Waldhauser, F.; Bohnenstiehl, D.

The conodonts provide a classic example, their tooth- like elements having been assigned to various invertebrate and vertebrate groups for more than 125 years until the discovery of their soft tissues revealed them to be crown- group vertebrates(1). Machaeridians, which are virtually ubiquitous as shell plates in benthic marine shelly assemblages ranging from Early Ordovician ( Late Tremadoc) to Carboniferous(2), have proved no less enigmatic. The Machaeridia comprise three distinct families of worm- like animals, united by the possession of a dorsal skeleton of calcite plates that is rarely found articulated. Since they were first described 150 years ago(3) machaeridians have been allied with barnacles(4,5), echinoderms(6,7), molluscs(3,8-10) or annelids(9,11,12). Here we describe a new machaeridian with preserved soft parts, including parapodia and chaetae, from the Upper Tremadoc of Morocco, demonstrating the annelid affinity of the group. This discovery shows that a lineage of annelids evolved a dorsal skeleton of calcareous plates early in their history; it also resolves the affinities of a group of problematic Palaeozoic invertebrates previously known only from isolated elements and occasional skeletal assemblages.","[Vinther, Jakob; Briggs, Derek E.

When an individual's cooperativeness is used by other individuals as a choice criterion, there can be competition to be more generous than others, a situation called competitive altruism(5). The evolution of cooperation between non- relatives can then be driven by a positive feedback between increasing levels of cooperativeness and choosiness(6). Here we use evolutionary simulations to show that, in a situation where individuals have the opportunity to engage in repeated pairwise interactions, the equilibrium degree of cooperativeness depends critically on the amount of behavioural variation that is being maintained in the population by processes such as mutation. Because our model does not invoke complex mechanisms such as negotiation behaviour, it can be applied to a wide range of species.

Different gene combinations reside at these mating- type ( MAT) loci and confer sexual identity; invariably they encode homeodomain, alpha-box, or high mobility group ( HMG)- domain transcription factors(1). So far, MAT loci have been characterized from a single monophyletic clade of fungi, the Dikarya ( the ascomycetes and basidiomycetes)(2), and the ancestral state and evolutionary history of these loci have remained a mystery. Mating in the basal members of the kingdom has been less well studied, and even their precise taxonomic interrelationships are still obscure(3,4). Here we apply bioinformatic and genetic mapping to identify the sex- determining ( sex) region in Phycomyces blakesleeanus ( Zygomycota), which represents an early branch within the fungi. Each sex allele contains a single gene that encodes an HMG- domain protein, implicating the HMG- domain proteins as an earlier form of fungal MAT loci.

Widespread sense - antisense transcripts have been systematically identified in mammalian cells(6), and global transcriptome analysis shows that up to 70% of transcripts have antisense partners and that perturbation of antisense RNA can alter the expression of the sense gene(7). For example, it has been shown that an antisense transcript not naturally occurring but induced by genetic mutation leads to gene silencing and DNA methylation, causing thalassaemia in a patient(8). Here we show that many TSGs have nearby antisense RNAs, and we focus on the role of one RNA in silencing p15, a cyclin- dependent kinase inhibitor implicated in leukaemia. We found an inverse relation between p15 antisense ( p15AS) and p15 sense expression in leukaemia. A p15AS expression construct induced p15 silencing in cis and in trans through heterochromatin formation but not DNA methylation; the silencing persisted after p15AS was turned off, although methylation and heterochromatin inhibitors reversed this process. The p15AS-induced silencing was Dicer- independent. Expression of exogenous p15AS in mouse embryonic stem cells caused p15 silencing and increased growth, through heterochromatin formation, as well as DNA methylation after differentiation of the embryonic stem cells. Thus, natural antisense RNA may be a trigger for heterochromatin formation and DNA methylation in TSG silencing in tumorigenesis.","[Yu, Wenqiang; Onyango, Patrick; Feinberg, Andrew P.; Cui, Hengmi] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Epigenet, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Yu, Wenqiang; Onyango, Patrick; Feinberg, Andrew P.; Cui, Hengmi] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Gius, David; Muldoon-Jacobs, Kristi] NCI, Radiat Oncol Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Karp, Judith] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Sidney Kimmel Comprehens Canc Ctr, Baltimore, MD 21231 USA","Cui, HM (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Epigenet, 720 Rutland Ave, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",afeinberg@jhu.edu; hcui@jhmi.edu,,,"NCI NIH HHS [R01 CA054358, R37 CA054358, R37 CA054358-18]",,,22,535,595,1,59,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Jan,2008,451,7175,,,,,202,U10,,10.1038/nature06468,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,249GA,WOS:000252214400045,18185590.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,hengmi,cui,na,na,na,na,na

Compared to animal(2) and plant cells(3), the molecular mechanisms that govern calcium signalling in parasites are poorly understood. Here we show that the production of the phytohormone abscisic acid ( ABA) controls calcium signalling within the apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii, an opportunistic human pathogen. In plants, ABA controls a number of important events, including environmental stress responses, embryo development and seed dormancy(4,5). ABA induces production of the second- messenger cyclic ADP ribose ( cADPR), which controls release of intracellular calcium stores in plants(6). cADPR also controls intracellular calcium release in the protozoan parasite T. gondii(7,8); however, previous studies have not revealed the molecular basis of this pathway(9). We found that addition of exogenous ABA induced formation of cADPR in T. gondii, stimulated calcium- dependent protein secretion, and induced parasite egress from the infected host cell in a density- dependent manner. Production of endogenous ABA within the parasite was confirmed by purification ( using high- performance liquid chromatography) and analysis ( by gas chromatography- mass spectrometry). Selective disruption of ABA synthesis by the inhibitor fluridone delayed egress and induced development of the slow- growing, dormant cyst stage of the parasite. Thus, ABA- mediated calcium signalling controls the decision between lytic and chronic stage growth, a developmental switch that is central in pathogenesis and transmission. The pathway for ABA production was probably acquired with an algal endosymbiont that was retained as a non- photosynthetic plastid known as the apicoplast. The plant- like nature of this pathway may be exploited therapeutically, as shown by the ability of a specific inhibitor of ABA synthesis to prevent toxoplasmosis in the mouse model.","[Nagamune, Kisaburo; Fux, Blima; Brossier, Fabien; Sibley, L.

Various milestone discoveries have since been made, from an insufficient ability of patients' leucocytes to kill microbes to the underlying genetic abnormalities(1). In this inherited disorder, phagocytes lack NADPH oxidase activity and do not generate reactive oxygen species, most notably superoxide anion, causing recurrent bacterial and fungal infections. Patients with CGD also suffer from chronic inflammatory conditions, most prominently granuloma formation in hollow viscera. The precise mechanisms of the increased microbial pathogenicity have been unclear(2), and more so the reasons for the exaggerated inflammatory response(3-6). Here we show that a superoxide- dependent step in tryptophan metabolism along the kynurenine pathway is blocked in CGD mice with lethal pulmonary aspergillosis, leading to unrestrained V gamma 1(+) gamma delta T- cell reactivity, dominant production of interleukin ( IL)- 17, defective regulatory T- cell activity and acute inflammatory lung injury. Although beneficial effects are induced by IL- 17 neutralization or gamma delta T- cell contraction, complete cure and reversal of the hyperinflammatory phenotype are achieved by replacement therapy with a natural kynurenine distal to the blockade in the pathway. Effective therapy, which includes co-administration of recombinant interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma), restores production of downstream immunoactive metabolites and enables the emergence of regulatory V gamma 4(+) gamma delta and Foxp3(+) alpha beta T cells. Therefore, paradoxically, the lack of reactive oxygen species contributes to the hyperinflammatory phenotype associated with NADPH oxidase deficiencies, through a dysfunctional kynurenine pathway of tryptophan catabolism. Yet, this condition can be reverted by reactivating the pathway downstream of the superoxide- dependent step.","[Romani, Luigina; Fallarino, Francesca; De Luca, Antonella; Montagnoli, Claudia; D'Angelo, Carmen; Zelante, Teresa; Vacca, Carmine; Bistoni, Francesco; Fioretti, Maria C.; Grohmann, Ursula; Puccetti, Paolo] Univ Perugia, Dept Expt Med, I-06126 Perugia, Italy; [Segal, Brahm H.] Roswell Pk Canc Inst, Div Infect Dis, Buffalo, NY 14263 USA","Romani, L (reprint author), Univ Perugia, Dept Expt Med, I-06126 Perugia, Italy.",iromani@unipg.it; plopcc@tin.it,"Fallarino, Francesca/O-3358-2013; zelante, teresa/F-7933-2017","Fallarino, Francesca/0000-0002-8501-2136; zelante, teresa/0000-0002-7071-0302; DE LUCA, ANTONELLA/0000-0002-6866-5530; Romani, Luigina/0000-0002-1356-525X; Grohmann, Ursula/0000-0001-7952-1850; Puccetti, Paolo/0000-0001-6674-2128",,,,39,354,364,6,34,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,10-Jan,2008,451,7175,,,,,211,U12,,10.1038/nature06471,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,249GA,WOS:000252214400047,18185592.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,paolo,puccetti,male,0.99,781,950IJKUAAAAJ,22230

In most insects, this switch is triggered by factors present in the male's seminal fluid. How these factors exert such profound effects in females is unknown. Here we identify a receptor for the Drosophila melanogaster sex peptide (SP, also known as Acp70A), the primary trigger of post- mating responses in this species. Females that lack the sex peptide receptor (SPR, also known as CG16752), either entirely or only in the nervous system, fail to respond to SP and continue to show virgin behaviours even after mating. SPR is expressed in the female's reproductive tract and central nervous system. The behavioural functions of SPR map to the subset of neurons that also express the fruitless gene, a key determinant of sex- specific reproductive behaviour. SPR is highly conserved across insects, opening up the prospect of new strategies to control the reproductive and host- seeking behaviours of agricultural pests and human disease vectors.","[Yapici, Nilay; Kim, Young-Joon; Ribeiro, Carlos; Dickson, Barry J.] Res Inst Mol Pathol, A-1030 Vienna, Austria","Dickson, BJ (reprint author), Res Inst Mol Pathol, Dr Bohr Gasse 7, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",dickson@imp.ac.at,"Marion-Poll, Frederic/D-8882-2011","Marion-Poll, Frederic/0000-0001-6824-0180; Ribeiro, Carlos/0000-0002-9542-7335",,,,45,205,211,5,64,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Jan,2008,451,7174,,,,,33,U1,,10.1038/nature06483,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,247KZ,WOS:000252079300026,18066048.0,No,,,11/20/17,barry j.,dickson,na,na,na,na,na

The timescale of planet formation remains unclear, so the detection of planets around young stars with protoplanetary disks is potentially of great interest. Hitherto, no such planet has been found. Here we report the detection of a planet of mass (9.8 +/- 3.3) M-Jupiter around TW Hydrae (TW Hya), a nearby young star with an age of only 8-10 Myr that is surrounded by a well- studied circumstellar disk. It orbits the star with a period of 3.56 days at 0.04 AU, inside the inner rim of the disk. This demonstrates that planets can form within 10 Myr, before the disk has been dissipated by stellar winds and radiation.","[Setiawan, J.; Henning, Th.; Launhardt, R.; Mueller, A.; Weise, P.; Kuerster, M.] Max Planck Inst Astron, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany","Setiawan, J (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Astron, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany.",setiawan@mpia.de; rlau@mpia.de,,,,,,29,108,108,0,2,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Jan,2008,451,7174,,,,,38,41,,10.1038/nature06426,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,247KZ,WOS:000252079300027,18172492.0,No,,,11/20/17,m.,kuerster,na,na,na,na,na

In contrast, no elementary particles with a net magnetic charge have ever been observed, despite intensive and prolonged searches ( see ref. 1 for example). We pursue an alternative strategy, namely that of realizing them not as elementary but rather as emergent particles - that is, as manifestations of the correlations present in a strongly interacting many- body system. The most prominent examples of emergent quasiparticles are the ones with fractional electric charge e/3 in quantum Hall physics(2). Here we propose that magnetic monopoles emerge in a class of exotic magnets known collectively as spin ice(3-5): the dipole moment of the underlying electronic degrees of freedom fractionalises into monopoles. This would account for a mysterious phase transition observed experimentally in spin ice in a magnetic field(6,7), which is a liquid - gas transition of the magnetic monopoles. These monopoles can also be detected by other means, for example, in an experiment modelled after the Stanford magnetic monopole search(8).","[Castelnovo, C.; Moessner, R.] Univ Oxford, Rudolf Peierls Ctr Theoret Phys, Oxford OX1 3NP, England; [Moessner, R.] Max Planck Inst Phys Komplexer Syst, D-01187 Dresden, Germany; [Sondhi, S.

Electron tomography requires a series of images taken for many different specimen orientations(2). This approach is ideal for stable and stationary structures(3). But ultrasmall nanoparticles are intrinsically structurally unstable and may interact with the incident electron beam(4-6), constraining the electron beam density that can be used and the duration of the observation. Here we use aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy(7), coupled with simple imaging simulation, to determine with atomic resolution the size, three- dimensional shape, orientation and atomic arrangement of size- selected gold nanoclusters that are preformed in the gas phase and soft- landed on an amorphous carbon substrate. The structures of gold nanoclusters containing 309 +/- 6 atoms can be identified with either Ino- decahedral, cuboctahedral or icosahedral geometries. Comparison with theoretical modelling of the system suggests that the structures are consistent with energetic considerations. The discovery that nanoscale gold particles function as active and selective catalysts for a variety of important chemical reactions has provoked much research interest in recent years(8-12). We believe that the detailed structure information we provide will help to unravel the role of these nanoclusters in size- and structure-specific catalytic reactions(11,12).

A simultaneous greening trend has also been observed, characterized by a longer growing season and greater photosynthetic activity(6,7). These observations have led to speculation that spring and autumn warming could enhance carbon sequestration and extend the period of net carbon uptake in the future(8). Here we analyse interannual variations in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration data and ecosystem carbon dioxide fluxes. We find that atmospheric records from the past 20 years show a trend towards an earlier autumn- to- winter carbon dioxide build- up, suggesting a shorter net carbon uptake period. This trend cannot be explained by changes in atmospheric transport alone and, together with the ecosystem flux data, suggest increasing carbon losses in autumn. We use a process- based terrestrial biosphere model and satellite vegetation greenness index observations to investigate further the observed seasonal response of northern ecosystems to autumnal warming. We find that both photosynthesis and respiration increase during autumn warming, but the increase in respiration is greater. In contrast, warming increases photosynthesis more than respiration in spring. Our simulations and observations indicate that northern terrestrial ecosystems may currently lose carbon dioxide in response to autumn warming, with a sensitivity of about 0.2 PgC degrees C-1, offsetting 90% of the increased carbon dioxide uptake during spring. If future autumn warming occurs at a faster rate than in spring, the ability of northern ecosystems to sequester carbon may be diminished earlier than previously suggested(9,10).","[Piao, Shilong; Ciais, Philippe; Friedlingstein, Pierre] CNRS, CEA, UMR, LSCE, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Peylin, Philippe] LBI, F-78026 Thiverval Grignon, France; [Reichstein, Markus] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07701 Jena, Germany; [Luyssaert, Sebastiaan] Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; [Margolis, Hank] Univ Laval, Fac Foresterie & Geomat, Ste Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; [Fang, Jingyun] Peking Univ, Dept Ecol, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Barr, Alan] Environm Canada, Div Climate Res, Saskatoon, SK S7N 3H5, Canada; [Chen, Anping] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Grelle, Achim] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Hollinger, David Y.] US Forest Serv, USDA, No Res Stn, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Laurila, Tuomas] Finnish Meteorol Inst, FIN-00101 Helsinki, Finland; [Lindroth, Anders] Lund Univ, Dept Phys Geog & Ecosyst Anal, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden; [Richardson, Andrew D.] Univ New Hampshire, Complex Syst Res Ctr, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Vesala, Timo] Univ Helsinki, Dept Phys Sci, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Piao, SL (reprint author), CNRS, CEA, UMR, LSCE, Batiment 709,CE, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France.",slpiao@lsce.ipsl.fr; philippe.ciais@lsce.ipsl.fr,"Lindroth, Anders/N-4697-2014; Chen, Anping/H-9960-2014; Fang, Jingyun/A-4282-2009; Luyssaert, Sebastiaan/F-6684-2011; Richardson, Andrew/F-5691-2011; Hollinger, David/G-7185-2012; Barr, Alan/H-9939-2014; Vuichard, Nicolas/A-6629-2011; Friedlingstein, Pierre/H-2700-2014; Vesala, Timo/C-3795-2017; Reichstein, Markus/A-7494-2011","Lindroth, Anders/0000-0002-7669-784X; Richardson, Andrew/0000-0002-0148-6714; Vesala, Timo/0000-0002-4852-7464; Reichstein, Markus/0000-0001-5736-1112; Peylin, Philippe/0000-0001-9335-6994; Luyssaert, Sebastiaan/0000-0003-1121-1869",,,,35,445,494,26,362,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Jan,2008,451,7174,,,,,49,U3,,10.1038/nature06444,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,247KZ,WOS:000252079300030,18172494.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,timo,vesala,male,1,140,na,na

The underlying causes of this temperature amplification remain uncertain. The reduction in snow and ice cover that has occurred over recent decades(6,7) may have played a role(5,8). Climate model experiments indicate that when global temperature rises, Arctic snow and ice cover retreats, causing excessive polar warming(9-11). Reduction of the snow and ice cover causes albedo changes, and increased refreezing of sea ice during the cold season and decreases in sea- ice thickness both increase heat flux from the ocean to the atmosphere. Changes in oceanic and atmospheric circulation, as well as cloud cover, have also been proposed to cause Arctic temperature amplification(12-17). Here we examine the vertical structure of temperature change in the Arctic during the late twentieth century using reanalysis data. We find evidence for temperature amplification well above the surface. Snow and ice feedbacks cannot be the main cause of the warming aloft during the greater part of the year, because these feedbacks are expected to primarily affect temperatures in the lowermost part of the atmosphere, resulting in a pattern of warming that we only observe in spring. A significant proportion of the observed temperature amplification must therefore be explained by mechanisms that induce warming above the lowermost part of the atmosphere. We regress the Arctic temperature field on the atmospheric energy transport into the Arctic and find that, in the summer half- year, a significant proportion of the vertical structure of warming can be explained by changes in this variable. We conclude that changes in atmospheric heat transport may be an important cause of the recent Arctic temperature amplification.","[Graversen, Rune G.; Mauritsen, Thorsten; Tjernstrom, Michael; Kallen, Erland; Svensson, Gunilla] Univ Stockholm, Dept Meteorol, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden","Graversen, RG (reprint author), Univ Stockholm, Dept Meteorol, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",rune@misu.su.se,"Mauritsen, Thorsten/G-5880-2013; Graversen, Rune/C-3956-2016","Mauritsen, Thorsten/0000-0003-1418-4077; Tjernstrom, Michael/0000-0002-6908-7410",,,,26,218,225,4,80,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,3-Jan,2008,451,7174,,,,,53,U4,,10.1038/nature06502,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,247KZ,WOS:000252079300031,18172495.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,gunilla,svensson,na,na,na,na,na

Earthquake nucleation is usually observed to take place at depths of 10 - 20 km, and so static overburden should be large enough to inhibit triggering by seismic- wave stress perturbations. To understand the physics of dynamic triggering better, as well as the influence of dynamic stressing on earthquake recurrence, we have conducted laboratory studies of stick - slip in granular media with and without applied acoustic vibration. Glass beads were used to simulate granular fault zone material, sheared under constant normal stress, and subject to transient or continuous perturbation by acoustic waves. Here we show that small- magnitude failure events, corresponding to triggered aftershocks, occur when applied sound- wave amplitudes exceed several microstrain. These events are frequently delayed or occur as part of a cascade of small events. Vibrations also cause large slip events to be disrupted in time relative to those without wave perturbation. The effects are observed for many large- event cycles after vibrations cease, indicating a strain memory in the granular material. Dynamic stressing of tectonic faults may play a similar role in determining the complexity of earthquake recurrence.","[Johnson, Paul A.] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Geophys Grp EES11, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA; [Savage, Heather; Knuth, Matt; Marone, Chris] Penn State Univ, Dept Geosci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Savage, Heather] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Knuth, Matt] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Geol & Geophys, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Gomberg, Joan] Univ Washington, Dept Earth & Space Sci, US Geol Survey, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Johnson, PA (reprint author), Los Alamos Natl Lab, Geophys Grp EES11, MS D443, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA.",paj@lanl.gov,,"Johnson, Paul/0000-0002-0927-4003",,,,17,83,87,1,36,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Jan,2008,451,7174,,,,,57,U5,,10.1038/nature06440,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,247KZ,WOS:000252079300032,18172496.0,No,,,11/20/17,chris,marone,male,0.93,8631,dQnMIVcAAAAJ,9283

To address these issues we introduced the light- gated algal channel channelrhodopsin- 2 (ChR2)(9) specifically into a small fraction of layer 2/3 neurons of the mouse primary somatosensory cortex. ChR2 photostimulation in vivo reliably generated stimulus- locked action potentials(10-13) at frequencies up to 50 Hz. Here we show that naive mice readily learned to detect brief trains of action potentials ( five light pulses, 1 ms, 20 Hz). After training, mice could detect a photostimulus firing a single action potential in approximately 300 neurons. Even fewer neurons ( approximately 60) were required for longer stimuli ( five action potentials, 250 ms).

Action potentials of sensory cortical neurons can be strongly correlated to properties of sensory stimuli(1) and reflect the subjective judgements of an individual about stimuli(2). Microstimulation experiments have established a direct link from sensory activity to behaviour(3,4), suggesting that small neuronal populations can influence sensory decisions(5). However, microstimulation does not allow identification and quantification of the stimulated cellular elements(6). The sensory impact of individual cortical neurons therefore remains unknown. Here we show that stimulation of single neurons in somatosensory cortex affects behavioural responses in a detection task. We trained rats to respond to microstimulation of barrel cortex at low current intensities. We then initiated short trains of action potentials in single neurons by juxtacellular stimulation. Animals responded significantly more often in single- cell stimulation trials than in catch trials without stimulation. Stimulation effects varied greatly between cells, and on average in 5% of trials a response was induced. Whereas stimulation of putative excitatory neurons led to weak biases towards responding, stimulation of putative inhibitory neurons led to more variable and stronger sensory effects. Reaction times for single- cell stimulation were long and variable. Our results demonstrate that single neuron activity can cause a change in the animal's detection behaviour, suggesting a much sparser cortical code for sensations than previously anticipated.","[Houweling, Arthur R.; Brecht, Michael] Bernstein Ctr Computat Neurosci, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Houweling, Arthur R.; Brecht, Michael] Humboldt Univ, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Houweling, Arthur R.; Brecht, Michael] Erasmus MC, Dept Neurosci, NL-3000 CA Rotterdam, Netherlands","Houweling, AR (reprint author), Bernstein Ctr Computat Neurosci, Philippstr 13,House 6, D-10115 Berlin, Germany.",arthur.houweling@bccn-berlin.de; michael.brecht@bccn-berlin.de,,,,,,31,194,195,4,36,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Jan,2008,451,7174,,,,,65,U8,,10.1038/nature06447,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,247KZ,WOS:000252079300034,18094684.0,No,,,11/20/17,michael,brecht,male,1,11094,na,na

Here we show the activation of TRPC5 ( canonical TRP 5) homomultimeric and TRPC5-TRPC1 heteromultimeric channels(3-5) by extracellular reduced thioredoxin, which acts by breaking a disulphide bridge in the predicted extracellular loop adjacent to the ion- selectivity filter of TRPC5. Thioredoxin is an endogenous redox protein with established intracellular functions, but it is also secreted and its extracellular targets are largely unknown(6-9). Particularly high extracellular concentrations of thioredoxin are apparent in rheumatoid arthritis(8,10-12), an inflammatory joint disease that disables millions of people worldwide(13). We show that TRPC5 and TRPC1 are expressed in secretory fibroblast- like synoviocytes from patients with rheumatoid arthritis, that endogenous TRPC5 - TRPC1 channels of the cells are activated by reduced thioredoxin, and that blockade of the channels enhances secretory activity and prevents the suppression of secretion by thioredoxin.

We used mouse models of Down's syndrome and of cancer in a biological approach to investigate the relationship between trisomy and the incidence of intestinal tumours. Apc(Min)-mediated tumour number was determined in aneuploid mouse models Ts65Dn, Ts1Rhr and Ms1Rhr. Trisomy for orthologues of about half of the genes on chromosome 21 ( Hsa21) in Ts65Dn mice or just 33 of these genes in Ts1Rhr mice resulted in a significant reduction in the number of intestinal tumours. In Ms1Rhr, segmental monosomy for the same 33 genes that are triplicated in Ts1Rhr resulted in an increased number of tumours. Further studies demonstrated that the Ets2 gene contributed most of the dosage- sensitive effect on intestinal tumour number. The action of Ets2 as a repressor when it is overexpressed differs from tumour suppression, which requires normal gene function to prevent cellular transformation. Upregulation of Ets2 and, potentially, other genes involved in this kind of protective effect may provide a prophylactic effect in all individuals, regardless of ploidy.","[Sussan, Thomas E.; Yang, Annan; Reeves, Roger H.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Sussan, Thomas E.; Yang, Annan; Reeves, Roger H.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Inst Med Genet, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Li, Fu; Ostrowski, Michael C.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Biochem, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Reeves, RH (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",rreeves@jhmi.edu,"Li, Fu/E-7072-2011; Ostrowski, Michael/H-3108-2011","Ostrowski, Michael/0000-0003-2948-6297",NCI NIH HHS [R01 CA053271],,,21,101,107,0,2,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Jan,2008,451,7174,,,,,73,U10,,10.1038/nature06446,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,247KZ,WOS:000252079300036,18172498.0,No,,,11/20/17,roger h.,reeves,na,na,na,na,na

NUMB is also an endocytic protein(2), and the NOTCH-NUMB counteraction has been linked to this function(3,4). There might be, however, additional functions of NUMB, as witnessed by its proposed role as a tumour suppressor in breast cancer(5). Here we describe a previously unknown function for human NUMB as a regulator of tumour protein p53 ( also known as TP53). NUMB enters in a tricomplex with p53 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase HDM2( also known as MDM2), thereby preventing ubiquitination and degradation of p53. This results in increased p53 protein levels and activity, and in regulation of p53- dependent phenotypes. In breast cancers there is frequent loss of NUMB expression(5). We show that, in primary breast tumour cells, this event causes decreased p53 levels and increased chemoresistance. In breast cancers, loss of NUMB expression causes increased activity of the receptor NOTCH5. Thus, in these cancers, a single event - loss of NUMB expression - determines activation of an oncogene ( NOTCH) and attenuation of the p53 tumour suppressor pathway. Biologically, this results in an aggressive tumour phenotype, as witnessed by findings that NUMB- defective breast tumours display poor prognosis. Our results uncover a previously unknown tumour suppressor circuitry.","[Colaluca, Ivan N.; Tosoni, Daniela; Nuciforo, Paolo; Senic-Matuglia, Francesca; Pece, Salvatore; Di Fiore, Pier Paolo] FIRC Inst Mol Oncol Fdn, IFOM, I-20139 Milan, Italy; [Colaluca, Ivan N.; Tosoni, Daniela; Galimberti, Viviana; Viale, Giuseppe; Pece, Salvatore; Di Fiore, Pier Paolo] European Inst Oncol, I-20141 Milan, Italy; [Viale, Giuseppe; Pece, Salvatore; Di Fiore, Pier Paolo] Univ Milan, Dipartimento Med Chirurg & Odontoiatria, I-20122 Milan, Italy","Pece, S (reprint author), FIRC Inst Mol Oncol Fdn, IFOM, Via Adamello 16, I-20139 Milan, Italy.",salvatore.pece@ifom-ieo-campus.it; pierpaolo.difiore@ifom-ieo-campus.it,"Pece, Salvatore/B-9609-2013; Tosoni, Daniela/K-4524-2014; Di Fiore, Pier Paolo/K-2130-2012","Pece, Salvatore/0000-0003-1764-3929; Di Fiore, Pier Paolo/0000-0002-2252-0950; Nuciforo, Paolo/0000-0003-1380-0990",Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro,,,32,211,239,0,22,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Jan,2008,451,7174,,,,,76,U11,,10.1038/nature06412,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,247KZ,WOS:000252079300037,18172499.0,No,,,11/20/17,pier paolo,di fiore,male,1,3,Gm7qnecAAAAJ,31841

A principal source of mistranslation comes from mistaking glycine or serine for alanine, which can lead to serious cell and animal pathologies, including neurodegeneration(3). A single specific GNU base pair ( G3 center dot U70) marks a tRNA for aminoacylation by alanyl-tRNA synthetase(6-9). Mistranslation occurs when glycine or serine is joined to the G3 center dot U70- containing tRNAs, and is prevented by the editing activity that clears the mischarged amino acid. Previously it was assumed that the specificity for recognition of tRNA(Ala) for editing was provided by the same structural determinants as used for aminoacylation. Here we show that the editing site of alanyl-tRNA synthetase, as an artificial recombinant fragment, targets mischarged tRNA(Ala) using a structural motif unrelated to that for aminoacylation so that, remarkably, two motifs ( one for aminoacylation and one for editing) in the same enzyme independently can provide determinants for tRNA(Ala) recognition. The structural motif for editing is also found naturally in genome-encoded protein fragments that are widely distributed in evolution(10-12). These also recognize mischarged tRNA(Ala). Thus, through evolution, three different complexes with the same tRNA can guard against mistaking glycine or serine for alanine.","[Beebe, Kirk; Mock, Marissa; Merriman, Eve; Schimmel, Paul] Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol Biol & Chem, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Beebe, Kirk; Mock, Marissa; Merriman, Eve; Schimmel, Paul] Scripps Res Inst, Skaggs Inst Chem Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Schimmel, P (reprint author), Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol Biol & Chem, 10550 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",schimmel@scripps.edu,,,,,,29,44,47,0,5,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Jan,2008,451,7174,,,,,90,U14,,10.1038/nature06454,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,247KZ,WOS:000252079300040,18172502.0,No,,,11/20/17,paul,schimmel,male,1,5931,na,na

This progression can still be seen in modern biology, where ribozymes, such as the ribosome and RNase P, have evolved into protein- dependent RNA catalysts ('RNPzymes'). Similarly, group I introns use RNA- catalysed splicing reactions, but many function as RNPzymes bound to proteins that stabilize their catalytically active RNA structure(1,2). One such protein, the Neurospora crassa mitochondrial tyrosyl- tRNA synthetase ( TyrRS; CYT- 18), is bifunctional and both aminoacylates mitochondrial tRNA(Tyr) and promotes the splicing of mitochondrial group I introns(3). Here we determine a 4.5-angstrom co-crystal structure of the Twort orf142-I2 group I intron ribozyme bound to splicing-active, carboxy- terminally truncated CYT- 18. The structure shows that the group I intron binds across the two subunits of the homodimeric protein with a newly evolved RNA- binding surface distinct from that which binds tRNA(Tyr). This RNA binding surface provides an extended scaffold for the phosphodiester backbone of the conserved catalytic core of the intron RNA, allowing the protein to promote the splicing of a wide variety of group I introns. The group I intron- binding surface includes three small insertions and additional structural adaptations relative to non- splicing bacterial TyrRSs, indicating a multistep adaptation for splicing function. The co- crystal structure provides insight into how CYT- 18 promotes group I intron splicing, how it evolved to have this function, and how proteins could have incrementally replaced RNA structures during the transition from an RNA world to an RNP world.","[Paukstelis, Paul J.; Lambowitz, Alan M.] Univ Texas Austin, Sch Biol Sci, Dept Chem & Biochem, Inst Mol & Cellular Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Paukstelis, Paul J.; Lambowitz, Alan M.] Univ Texas Austin, Sch Biol Sci, Sect Mol Genet & Microbiol, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Chen, Jui-Hui; Chase, Elaine; Golden, Barbara L.] Purdue Univ, Dept Biochem, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Lambowitz, AM (reprint author), Univ Texas Austin, Sch Biol Sci, Dept Chem & Biochem, Inst Mol & Cellular Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",lambowitz@mail.utexas.edu; barbgolden@purdue.edu,"Paukstelis, Paul/C-9599-2009; Paukstelis, Paul/D-6320-2011","Golden, Barbara/0000-0002-9741-882X",,,,34,55,56,0,8,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,3-Jan,2008,451,7174,,,,,94,U15,,10.1038/nature06413,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,247KZ,WOS:000252079300041,18172503.0,No,,,11/20/17,barbara l.,golden,na,na,na,na,na

In this process, Prxs can become inactivated through the hyperoxidation of an active site Cys residue to Cys sulphinic acid. The unique repair of this moiety by sulphiredoxin ( Srx) restores peroxidase activity and terminates the signal(2). The hyperoxidized form of Prx exists as a stable decameric structure with each active site buried. Therefore, it is unclear how Srx can access the sulphinic acid moiety. Here we present the 2.6 angstrom crystal structure of the human Srx - PrxI complex. This complex reveals the complete unfolding of the carboxy terminus of Prx, and its unexpected packing onto the backside of Srx away from the Srx active site. Binding studies and activity analyses of site- directed mutants at this interface show that the interaction is required for repair to occur. Moreover, rearrangements in the Prx active site lead to a juxtaposition of the Prx Gly- Gly- Leu- Gly and Srx ATP- binding motifs, providing a structural basis for the first step of the catalytic mechanism. The results also suggest that the observed interactions may represent a common mode for other proteins to bind to Prxs.","[Jonsson, Thomas J.; Johnson, Lynnette C.; Lowther, W.

LTP is input- specific at the level of individual synapses, but neural network models predict interactions between plasticity at nearby synapses. Here we show in mouse hippocampal pyramidal cells that LTP at individual synapses reduces the threshold for potentiation at neighbouring synapses. After input- specific LTP induction by two- photon glutamate uncaging or by synaptic stimulation, subthreshold stimuli, which by themselves were too weak to trigger LTP, caused robust LTP and spine enlargement at neighbouring spines. Furthermore, LTP induction broadened the presynaptic - postsynaptic spike interval for spike- timing- dependent LTP within a dendritic neighbourhood. The reduction in the threshold for LTP induction lasted similar to 10 min and spread over similar to 10 mm of dendrite. These local interactions between neighbouring synapses support clustered plasticity models of memory storage and could allow for the binding of behaviourally linked information on the same dendritic branch.","HHMI, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA; Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Watson Sch Biol Sci, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA","Svoboda, K (reprint author), HHMI, Janelia Farm Res Campus, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA.",svobodak@janelia.hhmi.org,,,Howard Hughes Medical Institute,,,53,288,293,3,34,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Dec,2007,450,7173,,,,,1195,U3,,10.1038/nature06416,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,243HA,WOS:000251786200042,18097401.0,No,,,11/20/17,karel,svoboda,male,0.92,90,HTuwJ_EAAAAJ,40813

The structure reveals that the enzyme enforces a 150 degrees DNA bend through a mechanism similar to that of remodelling proteins such as integration host factor. Large protein conformational changes accompany DNA deformation, creating a bipartite catalytic site that positions the DNA backbone near a reactive tyrosine and a coordinated magnesium ion. This configuration closely resembles the catalytic site of type IA topoisomerases, reinforcing an evolutionary link between these structurally and functionally distinct enzymes.

The timescales for formation and solidification of the Moon can be quantified by using Hf-182-W-182 and Sm-146-Nd-142 chronometry(2-4), but these methods have yielded contradicting results. In earlier studies(3,5-7), W-182 anomalies in lunar rocks were attributed to decay of Hf-182 within the lunar mantle and were used to infer that the Moon solidified within the first, 60 million years of the Solar System. However, the dominant W-182 component in most lunar rocks reflects cosmogenic production mainly by neutron capture of Ta-181 during cosmic- ray exposure of the lunar surface(3,7), compromising a reliable interpretation in terms of Hf-182-W-182 chronometry. Here we present tungsten isotope data for lunar metals that do not contain any measurable Ta- derived W-182. All metals have identical W-182/W-184 ratios, indicating that the lunar magma ocean did not crystallize within the first, 60 Myr of the Solar System, which is no longer inconsistent with Sm - Nd chronometry(8-11). Our new data reveal that the lunar and terrestrial mantles have identical W-182/W-184. This, in conjunction with Sm-147-Nd-143 ages for the oldest lunar rocks(8-11), constrains the age of the Moon and Earth to 62(-10)(+90) Myr after formation of the Solar System. The identical W-182/W-184 ratios of the lunar and terrestrial mantles require either that the Moon is derived mainly from terrestrial material or that tungsten isotopes in the Moon and Earth's mantle equilibrated in the aftermath of the giant impact, as has been proposed to account for identical oxygen isotope compositions of the Earth and Moon(12).","ETH, Inst Isotope Geochem & Mineral Resources, Dept Earth Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; Univ Cologne, Inst Mineral & Geochem, D-50674 Cologne, Germany","Touboul, M (reprint author), ETH, Inst Isotope Geochem & Mineral Resources, Dept Earth Sci, Clausiusstr 25, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",touboul@erdw.ethz.ch,"Bourdon, Bernard/A-3303-2008; Wieler, Rainer/A-1355-2010; Kleine, Thorsten/S-2792-2017","Wieler, Rainer/0000-0001-5666-7494; Kleine, Thorsten/0000-0003-4657-5961",,,,31,231,236,13,72,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Dec,2007,450,7173,,,,,1206,1209,,10.1038/nature06428,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,243HA,WOS:000251786200044,18097403.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,r.,wieler,na,na,na,na,na

In turn, the medium acts back on the particle. In a polar or ionic solid, a free electron distorts the crystal lattice, displacing the atoms from their equilibrium positions. The electron, when considered together with its surrounding lattice distortion, is a single quasiparticle(5,6), known as the Frohlich polaron(8,9). The basic properties of polarons and their drift motion in a weak electric field are well known(10-12). However, their non-linear high- field properties - relevant for transport on nanometre length and ultrashort timescales - are not understood. Here we show that a high electric field in the terahertz range drives the polaron in a GaAs crystal into a highly nonlinear regime where, in addition to the drift motion, the electron is impulsively moved away from the centre of the surrounding lattice distortion. In this way, coherent lattice vibrations ( phonons) and concomitant drift velocity oscillations are induced that persist for several hundred femtoseconds. They modulate the optical response at infrared frequencies between absorption and stimulated emission. Such quantum coherent processes directly affect high- frequency transport in nanostructures and may be exploited in novel terahertz-driven optical modulators and switches.","Mas Born Inst Nichtlineare Opt & Kurzzeitspekt, D-12489 Berlin, Germany; Paul Drude Inst Festkorperelekt, D-10117 Berlin, Germany","Woerner, M (reprint author), Mas Born Inst Nichtlineare Opt & Kurzzeitspekt, D-12489 Berlin, Germany.",woerner@mbi-berlin.de,"Reimann, Klaus/B-8824-2009; Elsaesser, Thomas/P-7608-2014; Gaal, Peter/M-7005-2017","Reimann, Klaus/0000-0003-4290-0659; Gaal, Peter/0000-0002-5429-0045",,,,26,83,84,4,38,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Dec,2007,450,7173,,,,,1210,1213,,10.1038/nature06399,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,243HA,WOS:000251786200045,18097404.0,No,,,11/20/17,r.,hey,na,na,na,na,na

Since their inception, frequency combs have triggered substantial advances in optical frequency metrology and precision measurements(6,7) and in applications such as broadband laser- based gas sensing(8) and molecular fingerprinting(9). Early work generated frequency combs by intra- cavity phase modulation(10,11); subsequently, frequency combs have been generated using the comb- like mode structure of mode- locked lasers, whose repetition rate and carrier envelope phase can be stabilized(12). Here we report a substantially different approach to comb generation, in which equally spaced frequency markers are produced by the interaction between a continuous- wave pump laser of a known frequency with the modes of a monolithic ultra- high- Q microresonator(13) via the Kerr nonlinearity(14,15). The intrinsically broadband nature of parametric gain makes it possible to generate discrete comb modes over a 500- nm- wide span (similar to 70 THz) around 1,550 nm without relying on any external spectral broadening. Optical- heterodyne- based measurements reveal that cascaded parametric interactions give rise to an optical frequency comb, overcoming passive cavity dispersion. The uniformity of the mode spacing has been verified to within a relative experimental precision of 7.3 x 10(-18). In contrast to femtosecond mode- locked lasers(16), this work represents a step towards a monolithic optical frequency comb generator, allowing considerable reduction in size, complexity and power consumption. Moreover, the approach can operate at previously unattainable repetition rates(17), exceeding 100 GHz, which are useful in applications where access to individual comb modes is required, such as optical waveform synthesis(18), high capacity telecommunications or astrophysical spectrometer calibration(19).","Max Planck Inst Quantum Opt, D-85748 Garching, Germany","Kippenberg, TJ (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Quantum Opt, Hans Kopfermann Str 1, D-85748 Garching, Germany.",tobias.kippenberg@mpq.mpg.de,"Kippenberg, Tobias/B-3133-2013; Schliesser, Albert/C-5619-2014; Del'Haye, Pascal/G-2588-2016","Schliesser, Albert/0000-0003-4317-5030; Del'Haye, Pascal/0000-0002-6517-6942",,,,30,732,734,25,265,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Dec,2007,450,7173,,,,,1214,1217,,10.1038/nature06401,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,243HA,WOS:000251786200046,18097405.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,t. j.,kippenberg,na,na,na,na,na

It is often assumed(2) that this carbon injection initiated the rapid increase in global surface temperatures and environmental change that characterize the climate perturbation(3-7), but the exact sequence of events remains uncertain. Here we present chemical and biotic records of environmental change across the Palaeocene/Eocene boundary from two sediment sections in New Jersey that have high sediment accumulation rates. We show that the onsets of environmental change ( as recorded by the abundant occurrence ('acme') of the dinoflagellate cyst Apectodinium) and of surface- ocean warming ( as evidenced by the palaeothermometer TEX86) preceded the light carbon injection by several thousand years. The onset of the Apectodinium acme also precedes the carbon isotope excursion in sections from the southwest Pacific Ocean(8) and the North Sea, indicating that the early onset of environmental change was not confined to the New Jersey shelf. The lag of similar to 3,000 years between the onset of warming in New Jersey shelf waters and the carbon isotope excursion is consistent with the hypothesis that bottom water warming caused the injection of C-13-depleted carbon by triggering the dissociation of submarine methane hydrates(1,9,10), but the cause of the early warming remains uncertain.","Univ Utrecht, Palaeobot & Palynol Lab, Inst Environm Biol, NL-3584 CD Utrecht, Netherlands; Univ Utrecht, Dept Earth Sci, NL-3584 CD Utrecht, Netherlands; Netherlands Inst Sea Res, Dept Marine Biogeochem & Toxicol, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Netherlands; Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Earth Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA; Rice Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Houston, TX 77005 USA","Sluijs, A (reprint author), Univ Utrecht, Palaeobot & Palynol Lab, Inst Environm Biol, Budapestlaan 4, NL-3584 CD Utrecht, Netherlands.",A.Sluijs@uu.nl,"Zachos, James/A-7674-2008; Brinkhuis, Henk/B-4223-2009; Sluijs, Appy/B-3726-2009; Dickens, Gerald/G-1222-2011; Crouch, Erica/C-2820-2013; Sinninghe Damste, Jaap/F-6128-2011","Sluijs, Appy/0000-0003-2382-0215; Sinninghe Damste, Jaap/0000-0002-8683-1854; John, Cedric/0000-0001-9711-1548",,,,30,161,166,4,63,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Dec,2007,450,7173,,,,,1218,U5,,10.1038/nature06400,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,243HA,WOS:000251786200047,18097406.0,No,,,11/20/17,gerald r.,dickens,na,na,na,na,na

These patterns of seismic anisotropy may be caused by three-dimensional flow associated with along- strike variations in slab geometry(1-5). The Mariana and Andean subduction systems are associated with the largest along- strike variations of slab geometry observed on Earth(6,7) and are ideal for testing the link between slab geometry and solid- state creep processes in the mantle. Here we show, with fully three- dimensional non- newtonian subduction zone models, that the strong curvature of the Mariana slab and the transition to shallow slab dip in the Southern Andes give rise to strong trench- parallel stretching in the warm- arc and warm- back-arc mantle and to abrupt rotations in stretching directions that are accompanied by strong trench- parallel stretching. These models show that the patterns of shear- wave splitting observed in the Mariana and southern Andean systems may be caused by significant three- dimensional flow induced by along- strike variations in slab geometry.","Univ Michigan, Dept Geol Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Kneller, EA (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Dept Geol Sci, 1006 CC Little Bldg, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",ekneller@umich.edu,,,,,,27,84,85,2,14,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Dec,2007,450,7173,,,,,1222,U6,,10.1038/nature06429,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,243HA,WOS:000251786200048,18097407.0,No,,,11/20/17,peter e.,van keken,na,na,na,na,na

The stability of these food webs(1,2) enables many species to coexist and to form diverse ecosystems. Recent theory finds predator - prey body- mass ratios to be critically important for food- web stability(3-5). However, the mechanisms responsible for this stability are unclear. Here we use a bioenergetic consumer - resource model(6) to explore how and why only particular predator - prey body- mass ratios promote stability in tri- trophic ( three- species) food chains. We find that this 'persistence domain' of ratios is constrained by bottom- up energy availability when predators are much smaller than their prey and by enrichment- driven dynamics when predators are much larger. We also find that 97% of the tri- trophic food chains across five natural food webs(7) exhibit body- mass ratios within the predicted persistence domain. Further analyses of randomly rewired food webs show that body mass and allometric degree distributions in natural food webs mediate this consistency. The allometric degree distributions hold that the diversity of species' predators and prey decreases and increases, respectively, with increasing species' body masses. Our results demonstrate how simple relationships between species' body masses and feeding interactions may promote the stability of complex food webs.","TH Darmstadt, Dept Biol, D-64287 Darmstadt, Germany; Pacific Ecoinformat & Computat Ecol Lab, Berkeley, CA 94703 USA","Otto, SB (reprint author), TH Darmstadt, Dept Biol, Schnittspahnstr 10, D-64287 Darmstadt, Germany.",sonotto@bio.tu-darmstadt.de,"Rall, Bjoern/G-1508-2013; Brose, Ulrich /I-3488-2014","Rall, Bjoern/0000-0002-3191-8389; ",,,,31,148,150,2,59,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Dec,2007,450,7173,,,,,1226,U7,,10.1038/nature06359,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,243HA,WOS:000251786200049,18097408.0,No,,,11/20/17,ulrich,brose,male,1,40,ug1HQecAAAAJ,8192

Deletion of Nanog causes early embryonic lethality(2), whereas constitutive expression enables autonomous self- renewal of embryonic stem cells(1). Nanog is accordingly considered a core element of the pluripotent transcriptional network(3-7). However, here we report that Nanog fluctuates in mouse embryonic stem cells. Transient downregulation of Nanog appears to predispose cells towards differentiation but does not mark commitment. By genetic deletion we show that, although they are prone to differentiate, embryonic stem cells can self- renew indefinitely in the permanent absence of Nanog. Expanded Nanog null cells colonize embryonic germ layers and exhibit multilineage differentiation both in fetal and adult chimaeras. Although they are also recruited to the germ line, primordial germ cells lacking Nanog fail to mature on reaching the genital ridge. This defect is rescued by repair of the mutant allele. Thus Nanog is dispensible for expression of somatic pluripotency but is specifically required for formation of germ cells. Nanog therefore acts primarily in construction of inner cell mass and germ cell states rather than in the housekeeping machinery of pluripotency. We surmise that Nanog stabilizes embryonic stem cells in culture by resisting or reversing alternative gene expression states.","Univ Edinburgh, MRC Ctr Dev Stem Cell Biol, Inst Stem Cell Res, Sch Biol Sci, Edinburgh EH9 3JQ, Midlothian, Scotland; Univ Cambridge, Wellcome Trust Ctr Stem Cell Res, Cambridge CB2 1QR, England; Univ Cambridge, Dept Biochem, Cambridge CB2 1QR, England; Univ Cambridge, Dept Physiol Dev & Neurosci, Cambridge CB2 1QR, England","Chambers, I (reprint author), Univ Edinburgh, MRC Ctr Dev Stem Cell Biol, Inst Stem Cell Res, Sch Biol Sci, Kings Bldg,W Mains Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3JQ, Midlothian, Scotland.",ichambers@ed.ac.uk,"Chambers, Ian/H-5416-2011; Silva, Jose/G-1920-2014; Vrana, Jan/F-7306-2014","Chambers, Ian/0000-0003-2605-1597; Silva, Jose/0000-0001-5487-1117; Vrana, Jan/0000-0001-6171-8516; Nijmeijer-Winter, Bianca/0000-0002-9429-8439; Smith, Austin/0000-0002-3029-4682","Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [G15381/2]; Medical Research Council [G0300058, G9806702]; Wellcome Trust",,,33,826,858,8,90,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,20-Dec,2007,450,7173,,,,,1230,U8,,10.1038/nature06403,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,243HA,WOS:000251786200050,18097409.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,austin,smith,male,0.96,709,l1IW7BUAAAAJ,34282

Although extremely rare, CTCs represent a potential alternative to invasive biopsies as a source of tumour tissue for the detection, characterization and monitoring of non-haematologic cancers(5-8). The ability to identify, isolate, propagate and molecularly characterize CTC subpopulations could further the discovery of cancer stem cell biomarkers and expand the understanding of the biology of metastasis. Current strategies for isolating CTCs are limited to complex analytic approaches that generate very low yield and purity(9). Here we describe the development of a unique microfluidic platform ( the 'CTC-chip') capable of efficient and selective separation of viable CTCs from peripheral whole blood samples, mediated by the interaction of target CTCs with antibody ( EpCAM)- coated microposts under precisely controlled laminar flow conditions, and without requisite pre- labelling or processing of samples. The CTC- chip successfully identified CTCs in the peripheral blood of patients with metastatic lung, prostate, pancreatic, breast and colon cancer in 115 of 116 ( 99%) samples, with a range of 5-1,281 CTCs per ml and approximately 50% purity. In addition, CTCs were isolated in 7/7 patients with early- stage prostate cancer. Given the high sensitivity and specificity of the CTC- chip, we tested its potential utility in monitoring response to anti- cancer therapy. In a small cohort of patients with metastatic cancer undergoing systemic treatment, temporal changes in CTC numbers correlated reasonably well with the clinical course of disease as measured by standard radiographic methods. Thus, the CTC- chip provides a new and effective tool for accurate identification and measurement of CTCs in patients with cancer. It has broad implications in advancing both cancer biology research and clinical cancer management, including the detection, diagnosis and monitoring of cancer(10).","Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Surg Serv, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Boston, MA 02114 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, BioMEMS Resource Ctr, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Boston, MA 02114 USA; Shriners Hosp Children, Boston, MA 02114 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Massachusetts Gen Hosp Canc Ctr, Boston, MA 02114 USA","Toner, M (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Surg Serv, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",mtoner@hms.harvard.edu,,"Irimia, Daniel/0000-0001-7347-2082","NCI NIH HHS [K24 CA121990, K24 CA121990-02]; NIBIB NIH HHS [P41 EB002503]",,,32,1794,1861,118,1167,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Dec,2007,450,7173,,,,,1235,U10,,10.1038/nature06385,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,243HA,WOS:000251786200051,18097410.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,mehmet,toner,male,0.99,2004,FAabbnwAAAAJ,45858

One prevalent view is that such variation is simply 'noise' that the nervous system is unable to control or that remains below threshold for behavioural relevance(1-3). An alternative hypothesis is that such variation enables trial- and- error learning, in which the motor system generates variation and differentially retains behaviours that give rise to better outcomes. Here we test the latter possibility for adult bengalese finch song. Adult bird-song is a complex, learned motor skill that is produced in a highly stereotyped fashion from one rendition to the next(4,5). Nevertheless, there is subtle trial- by- trial variation even in stable, 'crystallized' adult song(6-8). We used a computerized system to monitor small natural variations in the pitch of targeted song elements and deliver real- time auditory disruption to a subset of those variations. Birds rapidly shifted the pitch of their vocalizations in an adaptive fashion to avoid disruption. These vocal changes were precisely restricted to the targeted features of song. Hence, birds were able to learn effectively by associating small variations in their vocal behaviour with differential outcomes. Such a process could help to maintain stable, learned song despite changes to the vocal control system arising from ageing or injury. More generally, our results suggest that residual variability in well learned skills is not entirely noise but rather reflects meaningful motor exploration that can support continuous learning and optimization of performance.","Univ Calif San Francisco, Keck Ctr Integrat Neurosci, Sloan Swartz Ctr Theoret Neurobiol, Dept Physiol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Psychiat, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Tumer, EC (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Keck Ctr Integrat Neurosci, Sloan Swartz Ctr Theoret Neurobiol, Dept Physiol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",evren@phy.ucsf.edu,,,,,,32,169,173,4,51,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Dec,2007,450,7173,,,,,1240,U11,,10.1038/nature06390,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,243HA,WOS:000251786200052,18097411.0,No,,,11/20/17,michael s.,brainard,na,na,na,na,na

Such information has been difficult to obtain because of the small size and inaccessibility of nerve terminals in the central nervous system. Here we show, by making direct patch- clamp recordings in vivo from cerebellar mossy fibre boutons - the primary source of synaptic input to the cerebellar cortex(1,2) - that sensory stimulation can produce bursts of spikes in single boutons at very high instantaneous firing frequencies ( more than 700 Hz). We show that the mossy fibre - granule cell synapse exhibits high- fidelity transmission at these frequencies, indicating that the rapid burst of excitatory postsynaptic currents underlying the sensory- evoked response of granule cells(3) can be driven by such a presynaptic spike burst. We also demonstrate that a single mossy fibre can trigger action potential bursts in granule cells in vitro when driven with in vivo firing patterns. These findings suggest that the relay from mossy fibre to granule cell can act in a 'detonator' fashion, such that a single presynaptic afferent may be sufficient to transmit the sensory message. This endows the cerebellar mossy fibre system with remarkable sensitivity and high fidelity in the transmission of sensory information.","UCL, Wolfson Inst Biomed Res, London WC1E 6BT, England; UCL, Dept Physiol, London WC1E 6BT, England","Hausser, M (reprint author), UCL, Wolfson Inst Biomed Res, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",m.hausser@ucl.ac.uk,"Mahon, Severine/E-7195-2017","Rancz, Ede Attila/0000-0002-7951-1385; Chadderton, Paul/0000-0002-6276-1011","Wellcome Trust [, 068699]",,,33,153,154,1,11,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Dec,2007,450,7173,,,,,1245,U12,,10.1038/nature05995,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,243HA,WOS:000251786200053,18097412.0,No,,,11/20/17,michael,haeusser,male,1,11094,yhMNQoQAAAAJ,14605

Stochastic gene expression creates a source of variability in the abundance of cellular components, even among isogenic cells exposed to an identical environment. Recent integrated experimental and modelling studies(4-13) have shed light on the molecular sources of this variability. However, many of these studies focus on systems that have reached a steady state and therefore do not address a large class of dynamic phenomena including oscillatory gene expression. Here we develop a general protocol for analysing and predicting stochastic gene expression in systems that never reach steady states. We use this framework to analyse experimentally stochastic expression of genes driven by the Synechococcus elongatus circadian clock. We find that, although the average expression at two points in the circadian cycle separated by 12 hours is identical, the variability at these two time points can be different. We show that this is a general feature of out- of- steady- state systems. We demonstrate how intrinsic noise sources, owing to random births and deaths of mRNAs and proteins, or extrinsic noise sources, which introduce fluctuations in rate constants, affect the cell- to- cell variability. To distinguish experimentally between these sources, we measured how the correlation between expression fluctuations of two identical genes is modulated during the circadian cycle. This quantitative framework is generally applicable to any out- of steady state system and will be necessary for understanding the fidelity of dynamic cellular systems.","MIT, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; MIT, George R Harrison Spect Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","van Oudenaarden, A (reprint author), MIT, Dept Phys, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",avano@mit.edu,,,,,,30,71,72,1,9,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Dec,2007,450,7173,,,,,1249,1252,,10.1038/nature06395,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,243HA,WOS:000251786200054,18097413.0,No,,,11/20/17,alexander,van oudenaarden,male,1,1645,pxkP0GQAAAAJ,26343

Autophagy, for either metabolic regulation or defence, involves the formation of a double membrane called the autophagosome, which then fuses with lysosomes to degrade the contents(4), a process that has similarities with phagosome maturation. Toll-like-receptor ( TLR) engagement activates a variety of defence mechanisms within phagocytes(5), including facilitation of phagosome maturation(6), and also engages autophagy(7). Therefore we speculated that TLR signalling might link these processes to enhance the function of conventional phagosomes. Here we show that a particle that engages TLRs on a murine macrophage while it is phagocytosed triggers the autophagosome marker LC3 to be rapidly recruited to the phagosome in a manner that depends on the autophagy pathway proteins ATG5 and ATG7; this process is preceded by recruitment of beclin 1 and phosphoinositide-3-OH kinase activity. Translocation of beclin 1 and LC3 to the phagosome was not associated with observable double- membrane structures characteristic of conventional autophagosomes, but was associated with phagosome fusion with lysosomes, leading to rapid acidification and enhanced killing of the ingested organism.","St Jude Childrens Hosp, Dept Immunol, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; St Jude Childrens Hosp, Dept Tumor Cell Biol, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; St Jude Childrens Hosp, Dept Biochem, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; Tokyo Metropolitan Inst Med Sci, Lab Frontier Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138613, Japan; Scripps Res Inst, Dept Canc Biol, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA","Green, DR (reprint author), St Jude Childrens Hosp, Dept Immunol, 332 N Lauderdale St, Memphis, TN 38105 USA.",douglas.green@stjude.org,"Dillon, Christopher/P-4457-2014","Dillon, Christopher/0000-0002-9458-0266",,,,30,595,608,10,83,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Dec,2007,450,7173,,,,,1253,1257,,10.1038/nature06421,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,243HA,WOS:000251786200055,18097414.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,douglas r.,green,na,na,na,na,na

Reformation of the nucleus involves chromatin decondensation and assembly of the double- membrane nuclear envelope around the chromatin; however, regulation of the process is still poorly understood(1,2). In vitro, nucleus formation requires p97 ( ref. 3), a hexameric ATPase implicated in membrane fusion and ubiquitin- dependent processes(4,5). However, the role and relevance of p97 in nucleus formation have remained controversial. Here we show that p97 stimulates nucleus reformation by inactivating the chromatin- associated kinase Aurora B. During mitosis, Aurora B inhibits nucleus reformation by preventing chromosome decondensation and formation of the nuclear envelope membrane. During exit from mitosis, p97 binds to Aurora B after its ubiquitylation and extracts it from chromatin. This leads to inactivation of Aurora B on chromatin, thus allowing chromatin decondensation and nuclear envelope formation. These data reveal an essential pathway that regulates reformation of the nucleus after mitosis and defines ubiquitin- dependent protein extraction as a common mechanism of Cdc48/p97 activity also during nucleus formation.","ETH, Inst Biochem, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; Univ Geneva, Sch Med, Dept Genet Med & Dev, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland","Meyer, HH (reprint author), ETH, Inst Biochem, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",hemmo.meyer@bc.biol.ethz.ch,,"Spiga, Fabio/0000-0002-0541-3141; Gotta, Monica/0000-0002-4336-7860; Meyer, Hemmo/0000-0003-1883-1796",,,,33,159,164,2,11,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Dec,2007,450,7173,,,,,1258,U13,,10.1038/nature06388,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,243HA,WOS:000251786200056,18097415.0,No,,,11/20/17,hemmo h.,meyer,na,na,na,na,na

RNA structures are believed to encode spatially tuned flexibility that can direct transitions along specific conformational pathways(4,5). However, this hypothesis has proved difficult to examine directly because atomic movements in complex biomolecules cannot be visualized in 3D by using current experimental methods. Here we report the successful implementation of a strategy using NMR that has allowed us to visualize, with complete 3D rotational sensitivity, the dynamics between two RNA helices that are linked by a functionally important trinucleotide bulge over timescales extending up to milliseconds. The key to our approach is to anchor NMR frames of reference onto each helix and thereby directly measure their dynamics, one relative to the other, using 'relativistic' sets of residual dipolar couplings ( RDCs)(6,7). Using this approach, we uncovered super- large amplitude helix motions that trace out a surprisingly structured and spatially correlated 3D dynamic trajectory. The two helices twist around their individual axes by approximately 536 and 1106 in a highly correlated manner ( R = 0.97) while simultaneously ( R = 0.81 - 0.92) bending by about 94 degrees. Remarkably, the 3D dynamic trajectory is dotted at various positions by seven distinct ligand- bound conformations of the RNA. Thus even partly unstructured RNAs can undergo structured dynamics that directs ligand- induced transitions along specific predefined conformational pathways.","Univ Michigan, Dept Chem & Biophys, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Al-Hashimi, HM (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Dept Chem & Biophys, 930 N Univ Ave, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",hashimi@umich.edu,"Zhang, Qi/F-3323-2010; Zhang, Qi/E-1722-2011; Zhang, Qi/B-5869-2014","Zhang, Qi/0000-0003-1754-4058",,,,36,179,180,2,35,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Dec,2007,450,7173,,,,,1263,U14,,10.1038/nature06389,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,243HA,WOS:000251786200057,18097416.0,No,,,11/20/17,hashim m.,al-hashimi,na,na,na,na,na

Plasmids serve as tractable model systems to study DNA segregation because they require only a DNA centromere, a centromere- binding protein and a force- generating ATPase. The centromeres of partition ( par) systems typically consist of a tandem arrangement of direct repeats(1-7). The best- characterized par system contains a centromere- binding protein called ParR and an ATPase called ParM. In the first step of segregation, multiple ParR proteins interact with the centromere repeats to form a large nucleoprotein complex of unknown structure called the segrosome, which binds ParM filaments(4,8-10). pSK41 ParR binds a centromere consisting of multiple 20- base- pair ( bp) tandem repeats to mediate both transcription autoregulation and segregation. Here we report the structure of the pSK41 segrosome revealed in the crystal structure of a ParR - DNA complex. In the crystals, the 20- mer tandem repeats stack pseudo- continuously to generate the full- length centromere with the ribbon - helix - helix ( RHH) fold of ParR binding successive DNA repeats as dimer- of- dimers. Remarkably, the dimer- of- dimers assemble in a continuous protein super- helical array, wrapping the DNA about its positive convex surface to form a large segrosome with an open, solenoid-shaped structure, suggesting a mechanism for ParM capture and subsequent plasmid segregation.","Univ Texas Houston, MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Unit 1000, Houston, TX 77030 USA; Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Schumacher, MA (reprint author), Univ Texas Houston, MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Unit 1000, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",maschuma@mdanderson.org,,,,,,34,62,62,0,8,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Dec,2007,450,7173,,,,,1268,U15,,10.1038/nature06392,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,243HA,WOS:000251786200058,18097417.0,No,,,11/20/17,neville,firth,na,na,na,na,na

Although the halo was once considered a single component, evidence for its dichotomy has slowly emerged in recent years from inspection of small samples of halo objects. Here we show that the halo is indeed clearly divisible into two broadly overlapping structural components - an inner and an outer halo - that exhibit different spatial density profiles, stellar orbits and stellar metallicities ( abundances of elements heavier than helium). The inner halo has a modest net prograde rotation, whereas the outer halo exhibits a net retrograde rotation and a peak metallicity one- third that of the inner halo. These properties indicate that the individual halo components probably formed in fundamentally different ways, through successive dissipational ( inner) and dissipationless ( outer) mergers and tidal disruption of proto- Galactic clumps.","INAF, Osservatorio Astron Torino, I-10025 Pino Torinese, Italy; Michigan State Univ, Ctr Study Cosm Evolut, Dept Phys & Astron, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; Michigan State Univ, Joint Inst Nucl Astrophys, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; Tohoku Univ, Astron Inst, Sendai, Miyagi 9808578, Japan; Australian Natl Univ, Mt Stromlo Observ, Res Sch Astron & Astrophys, Weston, ACT 2611, Australia; Texas Tech Univ, Dept Phys, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; USN Observ, Flagstaff, AZ 86002 USA; Max Planck Inst Astron, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; Univ Ljubljana, Dept Phys, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia; Univ Chicago, Dept Astron & Astrophys, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; Univ Chicago, Enrico Fermi Inst, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Carollo, D (reprint author), INAF, Osservatorio Astron Torino, I-10025 Pino Torinese, Italy.",carollo@mso.anu.edu.au,,"Re Fiorentin, Paola/0000-0002-4995-0475",,,,48,322,323,1,14,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Dec,2007,450,7172,,,,,1020,1025,,10.1038/nature06460,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,240HY,WOS:000251579900074,18075581.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,donald g.,york,male,1,1,na,na

To understand how chromatin structure is controlled across the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome, we have investigated the role of the ATP- dependent chromatin remodelling complex Isw2 in positioning nucleosomes. We find that Isw2 functions adjacent to promoter regions where it repositions nucleosomes at the interface between genic and intergenic sequences. Nucleosome repositioning by Isw2 is directional and results in increased nucleosome occupancy of the intergenic region. Loss of Isw2 activity leads to inappropriate transcription, resulting in the generation of both coding and noncoding transcripts. Here we show that Isw2 repositions nucleosomes to enforce directionality on transcription by preventing transcription initiation from cryptic sites. Our analyses reveal how chromatin is organized on a global scale and advance our understanding of how transcription is regulated.","Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Div Basic Sci, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Mol Pharmacol & Biochem, Worcester, MA 01605 USA","Tsukiyama, T (reprint author), Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Div Basic Sci, Seattle, WA 98109 USA.",ttsukiya@fhcrc.org,,"Whitehouse, Iestyn/0000-0003-0385-3116",,,,48,266,269,1,13,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Dec,2007,450,7172,,,,,1031,U3,,10.1038/nature06391,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,240HY,WOS:000251579900076,18075583.0,No,,,11/20/17,toshio,tsukiyama,male,1,2,na,na

The structures complete the cycle of nucleotide binding and cation transport of Ca2+-ATPase. Phosphorylation of the enzyme triggers the onset of a conformational change that leads to the opening of a luminal exit pathway defined by the transmembrane segments M1 through M6, which represent the canonical membrane domain of P-type pumps. Ca2+ release is promoted by translocation of the M4 helix, exposing Glu 309, Glu 771 and Asn 796 to the lumen.

Although considerable effort has been directed towards understanding the physics behind these mysterious and potentially destructive events, the complete picture remains uncertain. Furthermore, rogue waves have not yet been observed in other physical systems. Here, we introduce the concept of optical rogue waves, a counterpart of the infamous rare water waves. Using a new real- time detection technique, we study a system that exposes extremely steep, large waves as rare outcomes from an almost identically prepared initial population of waves. Specifically, we report the observation of rogue waves in an optical system, based on a microstructured optical fibre, near the threshold of soliton- fission supercontinuum generation(4,5) - a noise- sensitive(5-7) nonlinear process in which extremely broadband radiation is generated from a narrowband input(8). We model the generation of these rogue waves using the generalized nonlinear Schrodinger equation(9) and demonstrate that they arise infrequently from initially smooth pulses owing to power transfer seeded by a small noise perturbation.","Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Elect Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; Max Born Inst Nonlinear Opt & Short Pulse Spect, D-12489 Berlin, Germany","Solli, DR (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Elect Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",solli@ucla.edu,"Ropers, Claus/D-4843-2015","Ropers, Claus/0000-0002-9539-3817",,,,29,925,932,10,108,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Dec,2007,450,7172,,,,,1054,U7,,10.1038/nature06402,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,240HY,WOS:000251579900080,18075587.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,b.,jalali,na,na,na,na,na

The main contenders are lattice vibrations(1,2) ( phonons) and spin- excitations(3,4), with the additional possibility of pairing without mediators(5). In conventional superconductors, phonon- mediated pairing was unequivocally established by data from tunnelling experiments(6). Proponents of phonons as the high- T-c glue were therefore encouraged by the recent scanning tunnelling microscopy experiments on hole- doped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8-delta ( BSCCO) that reveal an oxygen lattice vibrational mode whose energy is anticorrelated with the superconducting gap energy scale(7). Here we report high-resolution scanning tunnelling microscopy measurements of the electron- doped high- T-c superconductor Pr0.88LaCe0.12CuO4 ( PLCCO) ( T-c= 24 K) that reveal a bosonic excitation ( mode) at energies of 10.5 +/- 2.5 meV. This energy is consistent with both spin- excitations in PLCCO measured by inelastic neutron scattering ( resonance mode)(8) and a low- energy acoustic phonon mode(9), but differs substantially from the oxygen vibrational mode identified in BSCCO.

For example, iron atoms are almost exclusively coordinated by three- dimensional polyhedra such as tetrahedra and octahedra. However, recent works have shown that binary metal hydrides act as reducing agents at low temperatures, allowing access to unprecedented structures(2-4). Here we show the reaction of a perovskite SrFeO3 with CaH2 to yield SrFeO2, a new compound bearing a square- planar oxygen coordination around Fe2(+). SrFeO2 is isostructural with 'infinite layer' cupric oxides(5-8), and exhibits a magnetic order far above room temperature in spite of the two-dimensional structure, indicating strong in-layer magnetic interactions due to strong Fe d to O p hybridization. Surprisingly, SrFeO2 remains free from the structural instability that might well be expected at low temperatures owing to twofold orbital degeneracy in the Fe2+ ground state with D-4h point symmetry. The reduction and the oxidation between SrFeO2 and SrFeO3 proceed via the brownmillerite- type intermediate SrFeO2.5, and start at the relatively low temperature of similar to 400 K, making the material appealing for a variety of applications, including oxygen ion conduction, oxygen gas absorption and catalysis.","Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Chem, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; Univ Rennes 1, Sci Chim Rennes UMR CNRS 6226, F-35042 Rennes, France; Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Human & Environm Studies, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; Kyoto Univ, Inst Chem Res, Kyoto 6110011, Japan; Res Inst Prod Dev, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6060805, Japan; Inst Max Von Laue Paul Langevin, F-38042 Grenoble, France","Kageyama, H (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Chem, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan.",kage@kuchem.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Kageyama, Hiroshi/A-4602-2010; Tassel, Cedric/L-5051-2014; Ceretti, Monica/E-4497-2015; Tsujimoto, Yoshihiro/H-6034-2012","Tsujimoto, Yoshihiro/0000-0003-2140-3362",,,,34,229,232,39,262,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Dec,2007,450,7172,,,,,1062,U8,,10.1038/nature06382,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,240HY,WOS:000251579900082,18075589.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,w.,paulus,na,na,na,na,na

It is often assumed that warmer sea surface temperatures provide a more favourable environment for the development and intensification of tropical cyclones, but cyclone genesis and intensity are also affected by the vertical thermodynamic properties of the atmosphere(1,10-13). Here we use climate models and observational reconstructions to explore the relationship between changes in sea surface temperature and tropical cyclone 'potential intensity' - a measure that provides an upper bound on cyclone intensity(10-14) and can also reflect the likelihood of cyclone development(15,16). We find that changes in local sea surface temperature are inadequate for characterizing even the sign of changes in potential intensity, but that long- term changes in potential intensity are closely related to the regional structure of warming; regions that warm more than the tropical average are characterized by increased potential intensity, and vice versa. We use this relationship to reconstruct changes in potential intensity over the twentieth century from observational reconstructions of sea surface temperature. We find that, even though tropical Atlantic sea surface temperatures are currently at a historical high, Atlantic potential intensity probably peaked in the 1930s and 1950s, and recent values are near the historical average. Our results indicate that - per unit local sea surface temperature change - the response of tropical cyclone activity to natural climate variations, which tend to involve localized changes in sea surface temperature, may be larger than the response to the more uniform patterns of greenhouse- gas- induced warming.","NOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ 08542 USA; Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USA","Vecchi, GA (reprint author), NOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ 08542 USA.",Gabriel.A.Vecchi@noaa.gov,"Vecchi, Gabriel/A-2413-2008","Vecchi, Gabriel/0000-0002-5085-224X",,,,32,194,195,11,60,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,13-Dec,2007,450,7172,,,,,1066,U9,,10.1038/nature06423,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,240HY,WOS:000251579900083,18075590.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,brian j.,soden,na,na,na,na,na

Detailed diagnostic information on the timing and dynamics of such events, which are not resolved by plate kinematic reconstructions, can be obtained from the response of the interior of adjacent continental plates to stress changes generated by plate boundary processes. Here we demonstrate a causal relationship between North Atlantic continental rifting at similar to 62 Myr ago and an abrupt change of the intra- plate deformation style in the adjacent European continent. The rifting involved a left- lateral displacement between the North American- Greenland plate and Eurasia, which initiated the observed pause in the relative convergence of Europe and Africa(3). The associated stress change in the European continent was significant and explains the sudden termination of a similar to 20- Myr- long contractional intra- plate deformation within Europe(4), during the late Cretaceous period to the earliest Palaeocene epoch, which was replaced by low- amplitude intra- plate stress- relaxation features(5). The pre- rupture tectonic stress was large enough to have been responsible for precipitating continental break- up, so there is no need to invoke a thermal mantle plume as a driving mechanism. The model explains the simultaneous timing of several diverse geological events, and shows how the intra- continental stratigraphic record can reveal the timing and dynamics of stress changes, which cannot be resolved by reconstructions based only on plate kinematics.","Aarhus Univ, Dept Earth Sci, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Earth & Life Sci, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands","Nielsen, SB (reprint author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Hoegh Guldbergsgade 2, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",sbn@geo.au.dk,"Stephenson, Randell/A-3741-2012; Thomsen, Erik/A-4842-2012; Nielsen, Soren/A-5288-2012","Stephenson, Randell/0000-0003-4868-8601",,,,30,48,48,0,17,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Dec,2007,450,7172,,,,,1071,1074,,10.1038/nature06379,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,240HY,WOS:000251579900084,18075591.0,No,,,11/20/17,erik,thomsen,male,0.99,1072,fvZyVhwAAAAJ,20481

Hominin axial skeletons show many derived adaptations for bipedalism, including an elongated lumbar region, both in the number of vertebrae and their lengths, as well as a marked posterior concavity of wedged lumbar vertebrae, known as a lordosis(4-6). The lordosis stabilizes the upper body over the lower limbs in bipeds by positioning the trunk's centre of mass ( COM) above the hips. However, bipedalism poses a unique challenge to pregnant females because the changing body shape and the extra mass associated with pregnancy shift the trunk's COM anterior to the hips. Here we show that human females have evolved a derived curvature and reinforcement of the lumbar vertebrae to compensate for this bipedal obstetric load. Similarly dimorphic morphologies in fossil vertebrae of Australopithecus suggest that this adaptation to fetal load preceded the evolution of Homo.","Harvard Univ, Dept Anthropol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Univ Texas Austin, Dept Anthropol, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Whitcome, KK (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Anthropol, 11 Divin Ave, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",whitcome@fas.harvard.edu,,,,,,42,105,107,2,45,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Dec,2007,450,7172,,,,,1075,U11,,10.1038/nature06342,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,240HY,WOS:000251579900085,18075592.0,No,,,11/20/17,daniel e.,lieberman,na,na,na,na,na

Although mutators may increase adaptability to novel environmental conditions, they are also prone to the accumulation of deleterious mutations. The long-term maintenance of high bacterial mutation rates is therefore likely to be driven by rapidly changing selection pressures(8-14), in addition to the possible slow transition rate by point mutation from mutators to non- mutators(15). One of the most likely causes of rapidly changing selection pressures is antagonistic coevolution with parasites(16,17). Here we show whether coevolution with viral parasites could drive the evolution of bacterial mutation rates in laboratory populations of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens(18). After fewer than 200 bacterial generations, 25% of the populations coevolving with phages had evolved 10- to 100- fold increases in mutation rates owing to mutations in mismatch-repair genes; no populations evolving in the absence of phages showed any significant change in mutation rate. Furthermore, mutator populations had a higher probability of driving their phage populations extinct, strongly suggesting that mutators have an advantage against phages in the coevolutionary arms race. Given their ubiquity, bacteriophages may play an important role in the evolution of bacterial mutation rates.","Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; Biol Res Ctr, Inst Biochem, H-6701 Szeged, Hungary; IUNICS, Hosp Son Dureta, Microbiol Serv, Palma de Mallorca 07014, Spain; IUNICS, Hosp Son Dureta, Unidad Invest, Palma de Mallorca 07014, Spain","Buckling, A (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PS, England.",cpal@ramet.elte.hu; angus.buckling@zoo.ox.ac.uk,"Oliver, Antonio/E-4048-2012","Oliver, Antonio/0000-0001-9327-1894",,,,30,156,158,7,84,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Dec,2007,450,7172,,,,,1079,1081,,10.1038/nature06350,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,240HY,WOS:000251579900086,18059461.0,No,,,11/20/17,angus,buckling,male,0.96,103,LtWL6dAAAAAJ,11721

TRF3 is highly expressed during embryonic development, and studies in zebrafish and Xenopus have shown that it is required for normal embryogenesis(2,3). Here we show that zebrafish embryos depleted of Trf3 exhibit multiple developmental defects and, in particular, fail to undergo haematopoiesis. Expression profiling for Trf3-dependent genes identified mespa, which encodes a transcription factor whose murine orthologue is required for mesoderm specification(4), and chromatin immunoprecipitation verified that Trf3 binds to the mespa promoter. Depletion of Mespa resulted in developmental and haematopoietic defects markedly similar to those induced by Trf3 depletion. Injection of mespa messenger RNA ( mRNA) restored normal development to a Trf3- depleted embryo, indicating mespa is the single Trf3 target gene required for zebrafish embryogenesis. Zebrafish embryos depleted of Trf3 or Mespa also failed to express cdx4, a caudal- related gene required for haematopoiesis. Mespa binds to the cdx4 promoter, and epistasis analysis revealed an ordered trf3 - mespa - cdx4 pathway. Thus, in zebrafish, commitment of mesoderm to the haematopoietic lineage occurs through a transcription factor pathway initiated by a TBP- related factor.","Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Program Gene Funct & Express, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Program Mol Med, Worcester, MA 01605 USA","Lawson, ND (reprint author), Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Program Gene Funct & Express, 364 Plantat St, Worcester, MA 01605 USA.",nathan.lawson@umassmed.edu; michael.green@umassmed.edu,,,"Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NCRR NIH HHS [P40 RR012546]; NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM033977, R01 GM033977-23]",,,17,54,59,0,4,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Dec,2007,450,7172,,,,,1082,U12,,10.1038/nature06349,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,240HY,WOS:000251579900087,18046332.0,No,,,11/20/17,michael r.,green,na,na,na,na,na

The CLOCK - BMAL1 complex activates clock- controlled genes, including cryptochromes ( Crys), the products of which act as repressors by interacting directly with CLOCK - BMAL1(3,4). We have demonstrated that CLOCK possesses intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity and that this enzymatic function contributes to chromatin- remodelling events implicated in circadian control of gene expression(5). Here we show that CLOCK also acetylates a non- histone substrate: its own partner, BMAL1, is specifically acetylated on a unique, highly conserved Lys 537 residue. BMAL1 undergoes rhythmic acetylation in mouse liver, with a timing that parallels the downregulation of circadian transcription of clock- controlled genes. BMAL1 acetylation facilitates recruitment of CRY1 to CLOCK - BMAL1, thereby promoting transcriptional repression. Importantly, ectopic expression of a K537R- mutated BMAL1 is not able to rescue circadian rhythmicity in a cellular model of peripheral clock. These findings reveal that the enzymatic interplay between two clock core components(6,7) is crucial for the circadian machinery.","Univ Calif Irvine, Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; Toho Univ, Fac Med, Dept Physiol, Tokyo 1438540, Japan","Sassone-Corsi, P (reprint author), Univ Calif Irvine, Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",psc@uci.edu,"Sassone-Corsi, Paolo/H-6182-2011","Grimaldi, Benedetto/0000-0002-2589-9302",,,,30,247,263,2,22,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Dec,2007,450,7172,,,,,1086,U13,,10.1038/nature06394,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,240HY,WOS:000251579900088,18075593.0,No,,,11/20/17,paolo,sassone-corsi,male,0.99,781,TwRylasAAAAJ,47334

Studies of in vitro gene expression have found few transcriptional differences between different parasite strains(3). Here we present a large study of in vivo expression profiles of parasites derived directly from blood samples from infected patients. The in vivo expression profiles define three distinct transcriptional states. The biological basis of these states can be interpreted by comparison with an extensive compendium of expression data in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The three states in vivo closely resemble, first, active growth based on glycolytic metabolism, second, a starvation response accompanied by metabolism of alternative carbon sources, and third, an environmental stress response. The glycolytic state is highly similar to the known profile of the ring stage in vitro, but the other states have not been observed in vitro. The results reveal a previously unknown physiological diversity in the in vivo biology of the malaria parasite, in particular evidence for a functional mitochondrion in the asexual- stage parasite, and indicate in vivo and in vitro studies to determine how this variation may affect disease manifestations and treatment.","MIT, Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Immunol & Infect Dis, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; Harvard Univ, FAS Ctr Syst Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Cell Biol & Neurosci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; Novartis Res Fdn, Genom Inst, San Diego, CA 92121 USA; Cheikh Anta Diop Univ, Dantec Hosp, Lab Bacteriol & Virol, Dakar, Senegal; Cheikh Anta Diop Univ, Dantec Hosp, Dept Parasitol & Mycol, Dakar, Senegal; MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; Scripps Res Inst, Dept Cell Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Mesirov, JP (reprint author), MIT, Broad Inst, 7 Cambridge Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",mesirov@broad.mit.edu; aregev@broad.mit.edu,"Pochet, Nathalie/Q-1322-2017","Pochet, Nathalie/0000-0003-1820-5656; Winzeler, Elizabeth/0000-0002-4049-2113",NIAID NIH HHS [K23 AI054518],,,41,148,150,3,20,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Dec,2007,450,7172,,,,,1091,U15,,10.1038/nature06311,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,240HY,WOS:000251579900089,18046333.0,No,,,11/20/17,a.,regev,na,na,na,na,na

Growing microtubule plus ends have emerged as dynamic regulatory sites in which specialized proteins, called plus- end- binding proteins ( + TIPs), bind and regulate the proper functioning of microtubules(1-4). However, the molecular mechanism of plus- end association by + TIPs and their ability to track the growing end are not well understood. Here we report the in vitro reconstitution of a minimal plus- end tracking system consisting of the three fission yeast proteins Mal3, Tip1 and the kinesin Tea2. Using time- lapse total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we show that the EB1 homologue Mal3 has an enhanced affinity for growing microtubule end structures as opposed to the microtubule lattice. This allows it to track growing microtubule ends autonomously by an end recognition mechanism. In addition, Mal3 acts as a factor that mediates loading of the processive motor Tea2 and its cargo, the Clip170 homologue Tip1, onto the microtubule lattice. The interaction of all three proteins is required for the selective tracking of growing microtubule plus ends by both Tea2 and Tip1. Our results dissect the collective interactions of the constituents of this plus-end tracking system and show how these interactions lead to the emergence of its dynamic behaviour. We expect that such in vitro reconstitutions will also be essential for the mechanistic dissection of other plus- end tracking systems.","European Mol Biol Lab, Cell Biol & Biophys Unit, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; FOM, Inst Atom & Mol Phys, NL-1098 SJ Amsterdam, Netherlands","Surrey, T (reprint author), European Mol Biol Lab, Cell Biol & Biophys Unit, Meyerhofstr 1, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany.",dogterom@amolf.nl; brunner@embl.de; surrey@embl.de,"Brunner, Damian/F-2024-2011","Brunner, Damian/0000-0001-5250-492X; Surrey, Thomas/0000-0001-9082-1870",,,,30,240,246,2,45,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Dec,2007,450,7172,,,,,1100,1105,,10.1038/nature06386,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,240HY,WOS:000251579900091,18059460.0,No,,,11/20/17,thomas,surrey,male,1,3753,ZdTfq7YAAAAJ,1387

Eukaryotic transcription is known to be regulated by chromatin-associated proteins containing conserved protein domains that specifically recognize distinct covalent post- translational modifications on histones. However, it has been unclear whether similar mechanisms are involved in mammalian DNA recombination. Here we show that RAG2 - an essential component of the RAG1/2 V(D)J recombinase, which mediates antigen- receptor gene assembly(1) - contains a plant homeodomain ( PHD) finger that specifically recognizes histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 4 ( H3K4me3). The high- resolution crystal structure of the mouse RAG2 PHD finger bound to H3K4me3 reveals the molecular basis of H3K4me3- recognition by RAG2. Mutations that abrogate RAG2's recognition of H3K4me3 severely impair V( D) J recombination in vivo. Reducing the level of H3K4me3 similarly leads to a decrease in V(D)J recombination in vivo. Notably, a conserved tryptophan residue ( W453) that constitutes a key structural component of the K4me3- binding surface and is essential for RAG2's recognition of H3K4me3 is mutated in patients with immunodeficiency syndromes. Together, our results identify a new function for histone methylation in mammalian DNA recombination.

In all eukaryotes the plasma membrane potential and secondary transport systems are energized by the activity of P- type ATPase membrane proteins: H+-ATPase ( the proton pump) in plants and fungi(1-3), and Na+, K+-ATPase ( the sodium - potassium pump) in animals(4). The name P- type derives from the fact that these proteins exploit a phosphorylated reaction cycle intermediate of ATP hydrolysis(5). The plasma membrane proton pumps belong to the type III P- type ATPase subfamily, whereas Na+, K+-ATPase and Ca(2+-)ATPase are type II6. Electron microscopy has revealed the overall shape of proton pumps(7), however, an atomic structure has been lacking. Here we present the first structure of a P- type proton pump determined by X- ray crystallography. Ten transmembrane helices and three cytoplasmic domains define the functional unit of ATP- coupled proton transport across the plasma membrane, and the structure is locked in a functional state not previously observed in P- type ATPases. The transmembrane domain reveals a large cavity, which is likely to be filled with water, located near the middle of the membrane plane where it is lined by conserved hydrophilic and charged residues. Proton transport against a high membrane potential is readily explained by this structural arrangement.","Danish Natl Res Fdn, Ctr Membrane Pumps Cells & Dis PUMPKIN, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark; Aarhus Univ, Dept Mol Biol, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark; Univ Copenhagen, Dept Plant Biol, Plant Physiol & Anat Lab, DK-1871 Frederiksberg, Denmark","Nissen, P (reprint author), Danish Natl Res Fdn, Ctr Membrane Pumps Cells & Dis PUMPKIN, Gustav Wieds Vej 10C, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark.",palmgren@life.ku.dk; pn@mb.au.dk,"Morth, Jens Preben/G-4450-2013; Palmgren, Michael/A-9808-2013; Nissen, Poul/D-5774-2014; Pedersen, Bjorn/H-4128-2017","Morth, Jens Preben/0000-0003-4077-0192; Palmgren, Michael/0000-0002-9982-6114; Pedersen, Bjorn/0000-0001-7860-7230; Nissen, Poul/0000-0003-0948-6628",,,,39,211,221,4,68,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Dec,2007,450,7172,,,,,1111,U19,,10.1038/nature06417,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,240HY,WOS:000251579900093,18075595.0,No,,,11/20/17,poul,nissen,male,1,30,f21i0GUAAAAJ,18675

Because the time interval during which these events are believed to have occurred immediately preceded the Cambrian explosion of life, the issue as to whether such snowball states actually developed has important implications for our understanding of evolutionary biology. Here we couple an explicit model of the Neoproterozoic carbon cycle to a model of the physical climate system. We show that the drawdown of atmospheric oxygen into the ocean, as surface temperatures decline, operates so as to increase the rate of remineralization of a massive pool of dissolved organic carbon. This leads directly to an increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide, enhanced greenhouse warming of the surface of the Earth, and the prevention of a snowball state.","Univ Toronto, Dept Phys, Toronto, ON M5S 1A7, Canada","Peltier, WR (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Dept Phys, 60 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 1A7, Canada.",peltier@atmosp.physics.utoronto.ca,"Peltier, William/A-1102-2008","Crowley, John/0000-0001-8655-7907; Liu, Yonggang/0000-0001-8844-2185",,,,48,55,56,1,26,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,6-Dec,2007,450,7171,,,,,813,U1,,10.1038/nature06354,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,237RU,WOS:000251394900043,18064001.0,No,,,11/20/17,john w.,crowley,na,na,na,na,na

Here we show that transplantation of embryonic cardiomyocytes ( eCMs) in myocardial infarcts protects against the induction of ventricular tachycardia ( VT) in mice. Engraftment of eCMs, but not skeletal myoblasts ( SMs), bone marrow cells or cardiac myofibroblasts, markedly decreased the incidence of VT induced by in vivo pacing. eCM engraftment results in improved electrical coupling between the surrounding myocardium and the infarct region, and Ca2(+) signals from engrafted eCMs expressing a genetically encoded Ca2(+) indicator could be entrained during sinoatrial cardiac activation in vivo. eCM grafts also increased conduction velocity and decreased the incidence of conduction block within the infarct. VT protection is critically dependent on expression of the gap- junction protein connexin 43 ( Cx43; also known as Gja1): SMs genetically engineered to express Cx43 conferred a similar protection to that of eCMs against induced VT. Thus, engraftment of Cx43- expressing myocytes has the potential to reduce life- threatening post- infarct arrhythmias through the augmentation of intercellular coupling, suggesting autologous strategies for cardiac cell- based therapy.","Univ Bonn, Life & Brain Ctr, Inst Physiol 1, D-53105 Bonn, Germany; Univ Bonn, Dept Cardiac Surg, D-53105 Bonn, Germany; Univ Bonn, Dept Internal Med 2, D-53105 Bonn, Germany; Univ Bonn, Inst Genet, D-53105 Bonn, Germany; Univ Bonn, Inst Pharmacol, D-53105 Bonn, Germany; Cornell Univ, Coll Vet Med, Dept Biomed Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; Rhode Isl Hosp, Cardiovasc Res Ctr, Providence, RI 02903 USA; Brown Med Sch, Providence, RI 02903 USA; Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol & Physiol, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA","Fleischmann, BK (reprint author), Univ Bonn, Life & Brain Ctr, Inst Physiol 1, D-53105 Bonn, Germany.",mik7@cornell.edu; bernd.fleischmann@uni-bonn.de,"Sasse, Philipp/G-9866-2013; von Maltzahn, Julia/A-6689-2017","Sasse, Philipp/0000-0002-8502-9472; von Maltzahn, Julia/0000-0001-7674-1487; Hwang, Seong-min/0000-0003-1282-8828",,,,40,254,265,2,14,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Dec,2007,450,7171,,,,,819,U3,,10.1038/nature06321,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,237RU,WOS:000251394900044,18064002.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,bernd k.,fleischmann,na,na,na,na,na

We have previously shown that the related EG- VEGF and Bv8 proteins, also known as prokineticin 1 ( Prok1) and prokineticin 2 ( Prok2), promote both tissue- specific angiogenesis and haematopoietic cell mobilization. Unlike EG- VEGF, Bv8 is expressed in the bone marrow. Here we show that implantation of tumour cells in mice resulted in upregulation of Bv8 in CD11b(+) Gr1(+) myeloid cells. We identified granulocyte colony- stimulating factor as a major positive regulator of Bv8 expression. Anti- Bv8 antibodies reduced CD11b(+) Gr1(+) cell mobilization elicited by granulocyte colony- stimulating factor. Adenoviral delivery of Bv8 into tumours was shown to promote angiogenesis. Anti- Bv8 antibodies inhibited growth of several tumours in mice and suppressed angiogenesis. Anti- Bv8 treatment also reduced CD11b(+) Gr1(+) cells, both in peripheral blood and in tumours. The effects of anti- Bv8 antibodies were additive to those of anti- Vegf antibodies or cytotoxic chemotherapy. Thus, Bv8 modulates mobilization of CD11b(+) Gr1(+) cells from the bone marrow during tumour development and also promotes angiogenesis locally.","Genentech Inc, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA","Ferrara, N (reprint author), Genentech Inc, 1 DNA Way, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA.",nf@gene.com,,,,,,45,330,342,1,19,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Dec,2007,450,7171,,,,,825,U6,,10.1038/nature06348,,10,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,237RU,WOS:000251394900045,18064003.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,napoleone,ferrara,male,1,1,WPJnV70AAAAJ,145774

The three- dimensional reconstructions show a regular array of densities at similar to 70 angstrom intervals along the midline, with a curved shape resembling the X- ray structure of C- cadherin, a representative 'classical' cadherin. Model- independent three- dimensional image processing of extracted sub- tomograms reveals the cadherin organization. After fitting the C- cadherin atomic structure into the averaged sub- tomograms, we see a periodic arrangement of a trans W- like and a cis V- like interaction corresponding to molecules from opposing membranes and the same cell membrane, respectively.

It is generally recognized that substrate binding coupled to conformational changes of the substrate - enzyme complex aligns the reactive groups in an optimal environment for efficient chemistry. Although chemical mechanisms have been elucidated for many enzymes, the question of how enzymes achieve the catalytically competent state has only recently become approachable by experiment and computation. Here we show crystallographic evidence for conformational substates along the trajectory towards the catalytically competent 'closed' state in the ligand- free form of the enzyme adenylate kinase. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that these partially closed conformations are sampled in nanoseconds, whereas nuclear magnetic resonance and single- molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer reveal rare sampling of a fully closed conformation occurring on the microsecond- to- millisecond timescale. Thus, the larger- scale motions in substrate- free adenylate kinase are not random, but preferentially follow the pathways that create the configuration capable of proficient chemistry. Such preferred directionality, encoded in the fold, may contribute to catalysis in many enzymes.","Brandeis Univ, Dept Biochem, Waltham, MA 02454 USA; Brandeis Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Waltham, MA 02454 USA; Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Phys, D-06120 Halle, Germany; Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Biol Chem, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Univ Strasbourg 1, ISIS, Lab Chim Biophys, F-67000 Strasbourg, France","Kern, D (reprint author), Brandeis Univ, Dept Biochem, Waltham, MA 02454 USA.",huebner@physik.uni-luebeck.de; dkern@brandeis.edu,"Hubner, Christian/C-9512-2011","Henzler-Wildman, Katherine/0000-0002-5295-2121; Pozharski, Edwin/0000-0001-7012-5376",NIGMS NIH HHS [F32 GM070251],,,84,511,517,15,171,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Dec,2007,450,7171,,,,,838,U13,,10.1038/nature06410,,12,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,237RU,WOS:000251394900047,18026086.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,dorothee,kern,female,1,36,na,na

Theoretically, it has been shown that such escape is possible at least inside an orbit of 0.1 AU ( refs 4 and 5), and also that H(3)(+) ions play a crucial role in cooling the upper atmosphere(5,6). Jupiter's atmosphere is stable(7), so somewhere between 5 and 0.1 AU there must be a crossover between stability and instability. Here we show that there is a sharp breakdown in atmospheric stability between 0.14 and 0.16 AU for a Jupiter- like planet orbiting a solar- type star. These results are in contrast to earlier modelling(4,8) that implied much higher thermospheric temperatures and more significant evaporation farther from the star.

Here we report the result of ion microprobe U - Pb dating of phosphates in a lunar meteorite, Kalahari 009, which is classified as a very- low- Ti mare- basalt breccia. In situ analyses of five phosphate grains, associated with basaltic clasts, give an age of 4.35+/-0.15 billion years. These ancient phosphate ages are thought to represent the crystallization ages of parental basalt magma, making Kalahari 009 one of the oldest known mare basalts. We suggest that mare basalt volcanism on the Moon started as early as 4.35 Gyr ago, relatively soon after its formation and differentiation, and preceding the bulk of lunar volcanism which ensued after the late heavy bombardment around 3.8- 3.9 Gyr ( refs 7 and 8).

The first evidence for 'supersolidity', its analogue in quantum solids, came from torsional oscillator measurements(1,2) involving He-4. At temperatures below 200 mK, the torsional oscillator frequencies increased, suggesting that some of the solid decoupled from the oscillator. This behaviour has been replicated by several groups(3-7), but solid He-4 does not respond to pressure differences(8), and persistent currents and other signatures of superflow have not been seen. Both experiments and theory(9-14) indicate that defects are involved; these should also affect the solid's mechanical behaviour. Here we report a measurement of the shear modulus of solid He-4 at low frequencies and strains. We observe large increases below 200 mK, with the same dependence on measurement amplitude, He-3 impurity concentration and annealing as the decoupling seen in the torsional oscillator experiments. We explain this unusual elastic behaviour in terms of a dislocation network that is pinned by He-3 at the lowest temperatures but becomes mobile above 100 mK. The frequency changes in the torsional oscillator experiments appear to be related to the motion of these dislocations, perhaps by disrupting a possible supersolid state.","Univ Alberta, Dept Phys, Edmonton, AB T6G 2G7, Canada","Beamish, J (reprint author), Univ Alberta, Dept Phys, Edmonton, AB T6G 2G7, Canada.",beamish@phys.ualberta.ca,,"Day, James/0000-0003-4324-3486",,,,30,224,224,1,23,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Dec,2007,450,7171,,,,,853,856,,10.1038/nature06383,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,237RU,WOS:000251394900050,18064007.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,john,beamish,male,0.99,9931,INKXvRsAAAAJ,2260

In particular, systems based on photonic crystal nanocavities and semiconductor quantum dots have seen rapid progress. Recent experiments have allowed the observation of weak(1) and strong coupling(2,3) regimes of interaction between the photonic crystal cavity and a single quantum dot in photoluminescence. In the weak coupling regime(1), the quantum dot radiative lifetime is modified; in the strong coupling regime(3), the coupled quantum dot also modifies the cavity spectrum. Several proposals for scalable quantum information networks and quantum computation rely on direct probing of the cavity-quantum dot coupling, by means of resonant light scattering from strongly or weakly coupled quantum dots(4-9). Such experiments have recently been performed in atomic systems(10-12) and superconducting circuit QED systems(13), but not in solid-state quantum dot-cavity QED systems. Here we present experimental evidence that this interaction can be probed in solid-state systems, and show that, as expected from theory, the quantum dot strongly modifies the cavity transmission and reflection spectra. We show that when the quantum dot is coupled to the cavity, photons that are resonant with its transition are prohibited from entering the cavity. We observe this effect as the quantum dot is tuned through the cavity and the coupling strength between them changes. At high intensity of the probe beam, we observe rapid saturation of the transmission dip. These measurements provide both a method for probing the cavity-quantum dot system and a step towards the realization of quantum devices based on coherent light scattering and large optical nonlinearities from quantum dots in photonic crystal cavities.","Stanford Univ, Ginzton Lab, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Vuckovic, J (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Ginzton Lab, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",jela@stanford.edu,,,,,,25,391,395,8,99,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,6-Dec,2007,450,7171,,,,,857,861,,10.1038/nature06234,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,237RU,WOS:000251394900051,18064008.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,jelena,vuckovic,female,1,239,-afJI14AAAAJ,19080

The canonical experimental system studied in the optical domain is a single alkali atom coupled to a high-finesse Fabry-Perot cavity. Progress made in this system(1-5) has recently been complemented by research involving trapped ions(6), chip-based microtoroid cavities(7), integrated microcavity-atom-chips(8), nanocrystalline quantum dots coupled to microsphere cavities(9), and semiconductor quantum dots embedded in micropillars, photonic crystals and microdisks(10-12). The last system has been of particular interest owing to its relative simplicity and scalability. Here we use a fibre taper waveguide to perform direct optical spectroscopy of a system consisting of a quantum dot embedded in a microdisk. In contrast to earlier work with semiconductor systems, which has focused on photoluminescence measurements(10-14), we excite the system through the photonic ( light) channel rather than the excitonic ( matter) channel. Strong coupling, the regime of coherent quantum interactions, is demonstrated through observation of vacuum Rabi splitting in the transmitted and reflected signals from the cavity. The fibre coupling method also allows us to examine the system's steady-state nonlinear properties, where we see a saturation of the cavity-quantum dot response for less than one intracavity photon. The excitation of the cavity-quantum dot system through a fibre optic waveguide is central to applications such as high-efficiency single photon sources(15,16), and to more fundamental studies of the quantum character of the system(17).","CALTECH, Thomas J Watson Lab Appl Phys, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; CALTECH, Ctr Phys Informat, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Painter, O (reprint author), CALTECH, Thomas J Watson Lab Appl Phys, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",opainter@caltech.edu,"Srinivasan, Kartik/D-6369-2010","Painter, Oskar/0000-0002-1581-9209",,,,29,253,256,15,119,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Dec,2007,450,7171,,,,,862,U15,,10.1038/nature06274,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,237RU,WOS:000251394900052,18064009.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,oskar,painter,male,1,104,na,na

The existence of patches of dense partial melt at the base of the Earth's mantle(1), together with estimates of melting temperatures for deep mantle phases(2) and the amount of cooling of the underlying core required to maintain a geodynamo throughout much of the Earth's history(3), suggest that more extensive deep melting occurred in the past. Here we show that a stable layer of dense melt formed at the base of the mantle early in the Earth's history would have undergone slow fractional crystallization, and would be an ideal candidate for an unsampled geochemical reservoir hosting a variety of incompatible species ( most notably the missing budget of heat-producing elements) for an initial basal magma ocean thickness of about 1,000 km. Differences in Nd-142/Nd-144 ratios between chondrites and terrestrial rocks(4) can be explained by fractional crystallization with a decay timescale of the order of 1 Gyr. These combined constraints yield thermal evolution models in which radiogenic heat production and latent heat exchange prevent early cooling of the core and possibly delay the onset of the geodynamo to 3.4-4 Gyr ago(5).","Univ Lyon, CNRS, Lab Sci Terre, Ecole Normale Super Lyon,UMR 5570, F-69364 Lyon 07, France; Inst Phys Globe, F-75252 Paris, France; Univ Lyon 1, Lab Sci Terres, CNRS, UMR 5570, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France","Labrosse, S (reprint author), Univ Lyon, CNRS, Lab Sci Terre, Ecole Normale Super Lyon,UMR 5570, Allee Italie, F-69364 Lyon 07, France.",stephane.labrosse@ens-lyon.fr,"Labrosse, Stephane/C-8665-2012; Hernlund, John/A-8931-2014","Labrosse, Stephane/0000-0002-7620-4363; Hernlund, John/0000-0003-1008-0182",,,,28,284,290,7,87,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Dec,2007,450,7171,,,,,866,869,,10.1038/nature06355,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,237RU,WOS:000251394900053,18064010.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,n.,coltice,na,na,na,na,na

However, direct empirical evidence of long-term host-parasite coevolution, in particular `Red Queen' dynamics-in which antagonistic biotic interactions such as host-parasite interactions can lead to reciprocal evolutionary dynamics-is rare(3-5), and current data, although consistent with theories of antagonistic coevolution, do not reveal the temporal dynamics of the process(6). Dormant stages of both the water flea Daphnia and its microparasites are conserved in lake sediments, providing an archive of past gene pools. Here we use this fact to reconstruct rapid coevolutionary dynamics in a natural setting and show that the parasite rapidly adapts to its host over a period of only a few years. A coevolutionary model based on negative frequency-dependent selection, and designed to mimic essential aspects of our host parasite system, corroborated these experimental results. In line with the idea of continuing host-parasite coevolution, temporal variation in parasite infectivity changed little over time. In contrast, from the moment the parasite was first found in the sediments, we observed a steady increase in virulence over time, associated with higher fitness of the parasite.","Katholieke Univ Leuven, Lab Aquat Ecol & Evolut Biol, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; Katholieke Univ Leuven, Lab Anim Biodivers & Systemat, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; Katholieke Univ Leuven, Interdisciplinary Res Ctr, B-8500 Kortrijk, Belgium; Univ Basel, Inst Zool, CH-4053 Basel, Switzerland; INRA, UR1282, F-37380 Nouzilly, France","Decaestecker, E (reprint author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Lab Aquat Ecol & Evolut Biol, Charles Beriotstr 32, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium.",ellen.decaestecker@kuleuven-kortrijk.be,"Ebert, Dieter/B-5502-2009; Raeymaekers, Joost/J-9538-2014; Gaba, Sabrina/N-8428-2013; Decaestecker, Ellen/M-8949-2016; De Meester, Luc/F-3832-2015","Ebert, Dieter/0000-0003-2653-3772; Raeymaekers, Joost/0000-0003-2732-7495; Gaba, Sabrina/0000-0002-7145-6713; Decaestecker, Ellen/0000-0001-6328-5283; De Meester, Luc/0000-0001-5433-6843",,,,31,300,304,9,246,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Dec,2007,450,7171,,,,,870,U16,,10.1038/nature06291,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,237RU,WOS:000251394900054,18004303.0,No,,,11/20/17,luc,de meester,male,0.97,258,NwANSKoAAAAJ,15174

Environmental conditions in these areas vary from ambient temperature and neutral pH to high temperatures and low pH. Although there are strong indications for biological methane consumption in mud volcanoes(4,5), no methanotrophic bacteria are known that would thrive in the hostile conditions of fumaroles ( temperatures up to 70 degrees C and pH down to 1.8)(2). The first step in aerobic methane oxidation is performed by a soluble or membrane-bound methane mono-oxygenase. Here we report that pmoA ( encoding the beta-subunit of membrane-bound methane mono-oxygenase) clone libraries, made by using DNA extracted from the Solfatara volcano mudpot and surrounding bare soil near the fumaroles, showed clusters of novel and distant pmoA genes. After methanotrophic enrichment at 50 degrees C and pH 2.0 the most distant cluster, sharing less than 50% identity with any other described pmoA gene, was represented in the culture. Finally we isolated an acidiphilic methanotrophic bacterium Acidimethylosilex fumarolicum SolV belonging to the Planctomycetes/Verrucomicrobia/Chlamydiae superphylum(6), 'outside' the subphyla of the Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria containing the established methanotrophs. This bacterium grows under oxygen limitation on methane as the sole source of energy, down to pH 0.8-far below the pH optimum of any previously described methanotroph. A. fumarolicum SolV has three different pmoA genes, with two that are very similar to sequences retrieved from the mudpot. Highly homologous environmental 16S rRNA gene sequences from Yellowstone Park show that this new type of methanotrophic bacteria may be a common inhabitant of extreme environments. This is the first time that a representative of the widely distributed Verrucomicrobia phylum, of which most members remain uncultivated(6), is coupled to a geochemically relevant reaction.","Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Microbiol, IWWR, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands; Univ Naples 2, Dipartimento Sci Ambientali, I-81100 Caserta, Italy","Jetten, MSM (reprint author), Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Microbiol, IWWR, Toernooiveld 1, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands.",m.jetten@science.ru.nl; h.opdencamp@science.ru.nl,"Jetten, Mike/B-8834-2011; Op den Camp, Huub/F-5114-2011","Jetten, Mike/0000-0002-4691-7039; Op den Camp, Huub/0000-0003-1990-9030",,,,30,178,197,7,70,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Dec,2007,450,7171,,,,,874,U17,,10.1038/nature06222,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,237RU,WOS:000251394900055,18004305.0,No,,,11/20/17,huub j. m. op,den camp,na,na,na,na,na

They act as a biofilter to reduce methane emissions to the atmosphere, and they are therefore targets in strategies to combat global climate change. No cultured methanotroph grows optimally below pH 5, but some environments with active methane cycles are very acidic(2,3). Here we describe an extremely acidophilic methanotroph that grows optimally at pH 2.0-2.5. Unlike the known methanotrophs, it does not belong to the phylum Proteobacteria but rather to the Verrucomicrobia, a widespread and diverse bacterial phylum that primarily comprises uncultivated species with unknown genotypes. Analysis of its draft genome detected genes encoding particulate methane monooxygenase that were homologous to genes found in methanotrophic proteobacteria. However, known genetic modules for methanol and formaldehyde oxidation were incomplete or missing, suggesting that the bacterium uses some novel methylotrophic pathways. Phylogenetic analysis of its three pmoA genes ( encoding a subunit of particulate methane monooxygenase) placed them into a distinct cluster from proteobacterial homologues. This indicates an ancient divergence of Verrucomicrobia and Proteobacteria methanotrophs rather than a recent horizontal gene transfer of methanotrophic ability. The findings show that methanotrophy in the Bacteria is more taxonomically, ecologically and genetically diverse than previously thought, and that previous studies have failed to assess the full diversity of methanotrophs in acidic environments.","GNS Sci, Extremophile Res Grp, Taupo, New Zealand; Ariadne Genom Inc, Rockville, MD 20850 USA; Univ Hawaii, Dept Microbiol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; Coll Nat Sci, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; Nankai Univ, TEDA Sch Biol Sci & Biotechnol, Tianjin 300457, Peoples R China; Univ Hawaii Manoa, Biol Elect Microscopy Facil, Pacific Biosci Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; Netherlands Inst Ecol, NIOO KNAW, Ctr Limnol, Dept Microbial Wetland Ecol, NL-3631 AC Nieuwersluis, Netherlands; Max Planck Inst Terr Microbiol, D-35043 Marburg, Germany","Dunfield, PF (reprint author), Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",p.dunfield@gns.cri.nz; wanglei@nankai.edu.cn; alam@hawaii.edu,"Bodelier, Paul/A-9591-2011; Wang, Lei/C-5176-2009; Dunfield, Peter/C-3105-2009; Saw, Jimmy/A-9972-2009; feng, lu/M-5113-2015","Bodelier, Paul/0000-0002-5757-5572; Saw, Jimmy/0000-0001-8353-3854; Liesack, Werner/0000-0002-9533-1552; Stott, Matthew/0000-0002-2082-9460; Senin, Pavel/0000-0001-5517-7768; Hou, Shaobin/0000-0003-3467-8242",,,,29,245,273,13,133,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Dec,2007,450,7171,,,,,879,U18,,10.1038/nature06411,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,237RU,WOS:000251394900056,18004300.0,No,,,11/20/17,maqsudul,alam,na,na,na,na,na

This process, known as quorum sensing, relies on the secretion and detection of signalling molecules called autoinducers. At low cell density V. cholerae activates the expression of virulence factors and forms biofilms. At high cell density the accumulation of two quorum-sensing autoinducers represses these traits. These two autoinducers, cholerae autoinducer-1 (CAI-1) and autoinducer-2 (AI-2), function synergistically to control gene regulation, although CAI-1 is the stronger of the two signals. V. cholerae AI-2 is the furanosyl borate diester ( 2S, 4S)-2-methyl-2,3,3,4-tetrahydroxytetrahydrofuran borate(3). Here we describe the purification of CAI-1 and identify the molecule as ( S)-3-hydroxytridecan-4-one, a new type of bacterial autoinducer. We provide a synthetic route to both the R and S isomers of CAI-1 as well as simple homologues, and we evaluate their relative activities. Synthetic ( S)-3-hydroxytridecan-4-one functions as effectively as natural CAI-1 in repressing production of the canonical virulence factor TCP ( toxin co-regulated pilus). These findings suggest that CAI-1 could be used as a therapy to prevent cholera infection and, furthermore, that strategies to manipulate bacterial quorum sensing hold promise in the clinical arena.","Princeton Univ, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; Princeton Univ, Dept Chem, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; Princeton Univ, Lotus Separat LLC, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; Dartmouth Coll, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chevy Chase, MD 20815 USA","Bassler, BL (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Dept Mol Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",bbassler@princeton.edu,,,NIAID NIH HHS [R01 AI054442],,,29,228,237,6,63,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Dec,2007,450,7171,,,,,883,886,,10.1038/nature06284,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,237RU,WOS:000251394900057,18004304.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,bonnie l.,bassler,na,na,na,na,na

In type 1 diabetes the major genetic susceptibility determinants have been mapped to the MHC class II genes HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DRB1(refs 1-3), but these genes cannot completely explain the association between type 1 diabetes and the MHC region(4-11). Owing to the region's extreme gene density, the multiplicity of disease-associated alleles, strong associations between alleles, limited genotyping capability, and inadequate statistical approaches and sample sizes, which, and how many, loci within the MHC determine susceptibility remains unclear. Here, in several large type 1 diabetes data sets, we analyse a combined total of 1,729 polymorphisms, and apply statistical methods-recursive partitioning and regression-to pinpoint disease susceptibility to the MHC class I genes HLA-B and HLA-A (risk ratios > 1.5; P(combined) = 2.01 X 10(-19) and 2.35 X 10(-13), respectively) in addition to the established associations of the MHC class II genes.

The prospect of targeted therapies(2) and the development of high-resolution, genome-wide approaches(3-8) are now spurring systematic efforts to characterize cancer genomes. Here we report a large-scale project to characterize copy-number alterations in primary lung adenocarcinomas. By analysis of a large collection of tumours ( n = 371) using dense single nucleotide polymorphism arrays, we identify a total of 57 significantly recurrent events. We find that 26 of 39 autosomal chromosome arms show consistent large-scale copy-number gain or loss, of which only a handful have been linked to a specific gene. We also identify 31 recurrent focal events, including 24 amplifications and 7 homozygous deletions. Only six of these focal events are currently associated with known mutations in lung carcinomas. The most common event, amplification of chromosome 14q13.3, is found in similar to 12% of samples. On the basis of genomic and functional analyses, we identify NKX2-1 ( NK2 homeobox 1, also called TITF1), which lies in the minimal 14q13.3 amplification interval and encodes a lineage-specific transcription factor, as a novel candidate proto-oncogene involved in a significant fraction of lung adenocarcinomas. More generally, our results indicate that many of the genes that are involved in lung adenocarcinoma remain to be discovered.","Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Dana Farber Canc Inst, Ctr Canc Genome Discovery, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Canc Program, Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; Harvard Univ, Genome Biol Program, Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Univ Ulm, Inst Pathol, D-89081 Ulm, Germany; Washington Univ, Genome Sequencing Ctr, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; Washington Univ, Div Stat Genom, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; Washington Univ, Dept Pathol & Immunol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; Univ Cologne, Max Planck Inst Neurol Res, Klaus Joachim Zulch Labs, Max Planck Soc, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; Univ Cologne, Fac Med, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; Univ Cologne, Ctr Integrated Oncol, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; Univ Cologne, Dept Internal Med 1, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Med, New York, NY 10065 USA; Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Surg, New York, NY 10065 USA; Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10065 USA; Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Computat Biol, New York, NY 10065 USA; Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Human Oncol & Pathogenesis Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Canc Biol & Genet Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; Univ Michigan, Thorac Surg Sect, Dept Surg, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ Michigan, Dept Pathol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Nagoya City Univ, Sch Med, Dept Surg, Nagoya, Aichi 4678602, Japan; Baylor Coll Med, Human Genome Sequencing Ctr, Houston, TX 77030 USA; NHGRI, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; Univ Texas Houston, MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Pathol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; Univ Texas Houston, MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Thorac Head & Neck Med Oncol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; Univ Hlth Network, Toronto, ON M5G 2C4, Canada; Princess Margaret Hosp, Toronto, ON M5G 2C4, Canada; MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA","Meyerson, M (reprint author), Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",matthew_meyerson@dfci.harvard.edu,"Meyerson, Matthew/E-7123-2012; Sato, MITSUO/I-7280-2014; Tsao, Ming-Sound/M-3503-2017","Sato, MITSUO/0000-0001-5458-9576; Kris, Mark/0000-0002-7317-5341; Lash, Alex/0000-0003-3787-1590; Giordano, Thomas/0000-0003-0641-8873; McPherson, John/0000-0001-8049-9347; Rubin, Mark/0000-0002-8321-9950; Chang, Andrew/0000-0001-9506-0425","NCI NIH HHS [F32 CA113126-01A1, F32 CA113126-02, K08 CA122833-01A1, P50 CA070907]",,,40,693,712,2,44,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Dec,2007,450,7171,,,,,893,U22,,10.1038/nature06358,,9,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,237RU,WOS:000251394900059,17982442.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,matthew,meyerson,male,1,3338,OOyBQU0AAAAJ,67

Neurons that detect pheromones are thought to reside in at least two separate organs within the nasal cavity: the vomeronasal organ (VNO) and the main olfactory epithelium (MOE)(2). Each pheromone ligand is thought to activate a dedicated subset of these sensory neurons. However, the nature of the pheromone cues and the identity of the responding neurons that regulate specific social behaviours are largely unknown. Here we show, by direct activation of sensory neurons and analysis of behaviour, that at least two chemically distinct ligands are sufficient to promote male-male aggression and stimulate VNO neurons. We have purified and analysed one of these classes of ligand and found its specific aggression-promoting activity to be dependent on the presence of the protein component of the major urinary protein (MUP) complex, which is known to comprise specialized lipocalin proteins bound to small organic molecules(1,3,4). Using calcium imaging of dissociated vomeronasal neurons (VNs), we have determined that the MUP protein activates a sensory neuron subfamily characterized by the expression of the G-protein G alpha(o) subunit ( also known as Gnao) and Vmn2r putative pheromone receptors (V2Rs). Genomic analysis indicates species-specific co-expansions of MUPs and V2Rs, as would be expected among pheromone-signalling components. Finally, we show that the aggressive behaviour induced by the MUPs occurs exclusively through VNO neuronal circuits. Our results substantiate the idea of MUP proteins as pheromone ligands that mediate male-male aggression through the accessory olfactory neural pathway.","Scripps Res Inst, Dept Cell Biol, La Jolla, CA 92030 USA; Scripps Res Inst, Dept Chem, La Jolla, CA 92030 USA; Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Stowers, L (reprint author), Scripps Res Inst, Dept Cell Biol, La Jolla, CA 92030 USA.",stowers@scripps.edu,"Logan, Darren/D-5629-2009; Stowers, Lisa/K-6137-2015","Logan, Darren/0000-0003-1545-5510; Stowers, Lisa/0000-0002-4403-1269; Chamero, Pablo/0000-0002-4305-1073",,,,24,292,298,1,44,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Dec,2007,450,7171,,,,,899,U23,,10.1038/nature05997,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,237RU,WOS:000251394900060,18064011.0,No,,,11/20/17,lisa,stowers,female,1,6394,1sBMvJIAAAAJ,4127

Extensive experimental support now exists for the elimination and escape processes because immunodeficient mice develop more carcinogen-induced and spontaneous cancers than wild-type mice, and tumour cells from immunodeficient mice are more immunogenic than those from immunocompetent mice. In contrast, the equilibrium process was inferred largely from clinical observations, including reports of transplantation of undetected ( occult) cancer from organ donor into immuno-suppressed recipients(10). Herein we use a mouse model of primary chemical carcinogenesis and demonstrate that equilibrium occurs, is mechanistically distinguishable from elimination and escape, and that neoplastic cells in equilibrium are transformed but proliferate poorly in vivo. We also show that tumour cells in equilibrium are unedited but become edited when they spontaneously escape immune control and grow into clinically apparent tumours. These results reveal that, in addition to destroying tumour cells and sculpting tumour immunogenicity, the immune system of a naive mouse can also restrain cancer growth for extended time periods.","Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Immunol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; Univ Brescia, Spedali Civili, Dept Pathol, I-25123 Brescia, Italy; Peter MacCallum Canc Ctr, Canc Immunol Program, Sir Donald & Lady Trescowthick Labs, Melbourne, Vic 3002, Australia; Univ Melbourne, Dept Pathol, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Ludwig Inst Canc Res, New York, NY 10021 USA","Schreiber, RD (reprint author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Immunol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.",mark.smyth@petermac.org; schreiber@immunology.wustl.edu,"Schreiber, Robert/A-1276-2013; Smyth, Mark/H-8709-2014","Schreiber, Robert/0000-0001-6311-0432; Smyth, Mark/0000-0001-7098-7240",,,,32,635,654,6,59,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Dec,2007,450,7171,,,,,903,U24,,10.1038/nature06309,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,237RU,WOS:000251394900061,18026089.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,robert d.,schreiber,male,1,1,na,na

Dnmt1 is needed in S phase to methylate newly replicated CpGs occurring opposite methylated ones on the mother strand of the DNA, which is essential for the epigenetic inheritance of methylation patterns in the genome. Despite an intrinsic affinity of Dnmt1 for such hemi-methylated DNA(5), the molecular mechanisms that ensure the correct loading of Dnmt1 onto newly replicated DNA in vivo are not understood. The Np95 ( also known as Uhrf1 and ICBP90) protein binds methylated CpG through its SET and RING finger-associated ( SRA) domain(6). Here we show that localization of mouse Np95 to replicating heterochromatin is dependent on the presence of hemi-methylated DNA. Np95 forms complexes with Dnmt1 and mediates the loading of Dnmt1 to replicating heterochromatic regions. By using Np95-deficient embryonic stem cells and embryos, we show that Np95 is essential in vivo to maintain global and local DNA methylation and to repress transcription of retrotransposons and imprinted genes. The link between hemimethylated DNA, Np95 and Dnmt1 thus establishes key steps of the mechanism for epigenetic inheritance of DNA methylation.","RIKEN Res Ctr Allergy & Immunol, Tsurumi Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; RIKEN Genom Sci Ctr, Tsurumi Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; TUBERO, Aoba Ku, Sendai, Miyagi 9808575, Japan; Tohoku Univ, Sch Med, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Aoba Ku, Sendai, Miyagi 9808574, Japan; Univ Tokyo, Dept Chem & Biotechnol, Grad Sch Engn, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138565, Japan; RIKEN Ctr Dev Biol, Chuo Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan; Osaka Univ, Inst Prot Res, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; Prot Res Network Inc, Kanazawa Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360004, Japan","Koseki, H (reprint author), RIKEN Res Ctr Allergy & Immunol, Tsurumi Ku, 1-7-22 Suehiro, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan.",koseki@rcai.riken.jp,"Suetake, Isao/D-4326-2009; Mitsuya, Kohzoh/F-4437-2010; Suetake, Isao/G-3144-2013; Koseki, Haruhiko/I-3825-2014; Endo, Takaho/B-5763-2017","Suetake, Isao/0000-0002-1246-8474; Koseki, Haruhiko/0000-0001-8424-5854; Endo, Takaho/0000-0002-2801-2463",,,,30,567,587,9,58,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Dec,2007,450,7171,,,,,908,U25,,10.1038/nature06397,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,237RU,WOS:000251394900062,17994007.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,haruhiko,koseki,male,1,1,na,na

However, very little is understood about the connection of these functionally relevant, collective movements with local atomic fluctuations, which are much faster. Here we show that pico- to nano-second timescale atomic fluctuations in hinge regions of adenylate kinase facilitate the large-scale, slower lid motions that produce a catalytically competent state. The fast, local mobilities differ between a mesophilic and hyperthermophilic adenylate kinase, but are strikingly similar at temperatures at which enzymatic activity and free energy of folding are matched.

The convective cells in the vicinity of the subsolar point are much smaller than previously inferred(4-6), which we interpret as indicating that they are confined to the upper cloud layer, contrary to previous conclusions(7,8), but consistent with more recent study(9).","Max Planck Inst Sonnensyst Forsch, D-37191 Katlenburg Lindau, Germany; Space Res Inst, IKI, Moscow 117997, Russia; Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Space Sci & Engn, Madison, WI 53706 USA; Inst Planetenforsch, D-12489 Berlin, Germany; Univ Bern, Inst Phys, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; TU Braunschweig, IDA, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany","Markiewicz, WJ (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Sonnensyst Forsch, D-37191 Katlenburg Lindau, Germany.",markiewicz@mps.mpg.de,,"`Ignatiev, Nikolay/0000-0002-6358-7094",,,,17,76,77,1,9,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,29-Nov,2007,450,7170,,,,,633,636,,10.1038/nature06320,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,235BY,WOS:000251209700034,18046394.0,No,,,11/20/17,p.,russo,na,na,na,na,na

Infrared observations by previous missions to Venus revealed a bright 'dipole' feature surrounded by a cold 'collar' at its north pole(1-4). The polar dipole is a 'double-eye' feature at the centre of a vast vortex that rotates around the pole, and is possibly associated with rapid downwelling. The polar cold collar is a wide, shallow river of cold air that circulates around the polar vortex. One outstanding question has been whether the global circulation was symmetric, such that a dipole feature existed at the south pole. Here we report observations of Venus' south-polar region, where we have seen clouds with morphology much like those around the north pole, but rotating somewhat faster than the northern dipole. The vortex may extend down to the lower cloud layers that lie at about 50 km height and perhaps deeper. The spectroscopic properties of the clouds around the south pole are compatible with a sulphuric acid composition.","INAF IASF, Ist Astrofis Spaziale & Fis Cosm, I-00133 Rome, Italy; CNR, ISAC, I-00133 Rome, Italy; INAF IFSI, I-00133 Rome, Italy; Univ Paris Diderot, UPMC, Observ Paris, LESIA, F-92195 Meudon, France; Univ Basque Country, Escuela Super Ingn, Dept Fis Aplicada 1, Bilbao 48013, Spain; Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Clarendon Lab, Oxford OX1 3PU, England; Russian Acad Sci, Inst Space Res, Moscow 117997, Russia; Meteorol Dynam Lab, F-75252 Paris 05, France; Univ Padua, CISAS, I-35131 Padua, Italy; German Aerosp Ctr, DLR, Inst Planetary Explorat, Planetary Phys Sect, D-12489 Berlin, Germany; Jet Propuls Lab, Pasadena, CA 91011 USA; Univ Paris 11, Inst Astrophys Spatiale, F-91405 Orsay, France; Univ Lecce, Dipartimento Fis, I-73100 Lecce, Italy; Polish Acad Sci, Space Res Ctr, PL-00716 Warsaw, Poland; AMDLSPACE srl, I-00149 Rome, Italy; Inst Phys Globe Paris, Dept Etud Spatiales, F-94107 St Maur des Fosses, France; CSIC, Inst Astrofis Andalucia, E-18080 Granada, Spain; Univ G DAnnunzio, Dipartimento Sci, Int Res Sch Planetary Sci, I-65127 Pescara, Italy; Univ Nova Lisboa, Ctr Astron & Astrofis, Observ Astron Lisboa, P-1349018 Lisbon, Portugal; Politecn Milan, I-23900 Lecce, Italy; Univ Amsterdam, Astron Inst Anton Pannekoek, NL-1098 SJ Amsterdam, Netherlands; Max Planck Inst Aeron, D-37191 Katlenburg Lindau, Germany; Univ Aquila, Dipartimento Fis, I-67010 Laquila, Italy","Piccioni, G (reprint author), INAF IASF, Ist Astrofis Spaziale & Fis Cosm, Via Fosso Cavaliere 100, I-00133 Rome, Italy.",Giuseppe.piccioni@iasf-roma.inaf.it,"; Garcia, Raphael/B-2612-2012; moriconi, maria luisa/B-7201-2009; Luz, David/J-4588-2013; Rodin, Alexander/L-1904-2013; Fouchet, Thierry/C-6374-2017","Irwin, Patrick/0000-0002-6772-384X; Adriani, Alberto/0000-0003-4998-8008; Sanchez-Lavega, Agustin/0000-0001-7355-1522; Knoll, Ralph/0000-0001-8871-112X; saggin, bortolino/0000-0002-4033-3585; Tosi, Federico/0000-0003-4002-2434; Hueso, Ricardo/0000-0003-0169-123X; Lopez-Valverde, M.

Molecular emissions from the upper atmosphere (90-120 km altitude) of Venus can be used to investigate the energetics and to trace the circulation of this hitherto little-studied region. Previous spacecraft(1) and ground-based(2-4) observations of infrared emission from CO2, O-2 and NO have established that photochemical and dynamic activity controls the structure of the upper atmosphere of Venus. These data, however, have left unresolved the precise altitude of the emission(1) owing to a lack of data and of an adequate observing geometry(5,6). Here we report measurements of day-side CO2 non-local thermodynamic equilibrium emission at 4.3 mu m, extending from 90 to 120 km altitude, and of night-side O-2 emission extending from 95 to 100 km. The CO2 emission peak occurs at similar to 115 km and varies with solar zenith angle over a range of similar to 10 km. This confirms previous modelling(7), and permits the beginning of a systematic study of the variability of the emission. The O-2 peak emission happens at 96 km +/- 1 km, which is consistent with three-body recombination of oxygen atoms transported from the day side by a global thermospheric sub-solar to anti-solar circulation, as previously predicted(8).","Univ Paris Diderot, UPMC, CNRS, Observ Paris,LESIA, F-92195 Meudon, France; INAF IASF, I-00133 Rome, Italy; INAF IFSI, I-00133 Rome, Italy; Univ Liege, LPAP, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; CSIC, Inst Astrofis Andalucia, E-18008 Granada, Spain; Univ Basque Country, Escuela Super Ingn Fis Aplicada 1, Bilbao 48013, Spain; Space Res Inst, IKI, Moscow, Russia; Clarendon Lab, Oxford OX1 3PU, England; Univ Padua, CISAS, I-35131 Padua, Italy; German Aerosp Ctr, DLR, D-12489 Berlin, Germany; Jet Propuls Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA; Univ Paris 11, Inst Astrophys Spatiale, F-91405 Orsay, France; Univ Lecce, Dipartimento Fis, I-73100 Lecce, Italy; Ctr Badan Kosmicznych Pan, PL-00716 Warsaw, Poland; AMDLSPACE, I-00149 Rome, Italy; Observ Midi Pyrenees, CNRS, UMR5562, F-31400 Toulouse, France; UPMC, Meteorol Dynam Lab, F-75252 Paris 05, France; Univ G DAnnunzio, I-65127 Pescara, Italy; Lisbon Astron Observ, P-1349018 Lisbon, Portugal; Politecn Milan, I-20133 Milan, Italy; Univ Amsterdam, NL-1098 SJ Amsterdam, Netherlands; Max Planck Inst Aeron, D-37191 Katlenburg Lindau, Germany; Univ Aquila, Dipartimento Fis, I-67010 Laquila, Italy","Drossart, P (reprint author), Univ Paris Diderot, UPMC, CNRS, Observ Paris,LESIA, 5 Pl Jules Janssen, F-92195 Meudon, France.",,"; Garcia, Raphael/B-2612-2012; Luz, David/J-4588-2013; Rodin, Alexander/L-1904-2013; Fouchet, Thierry/C-6374-2017","Adriani, Alberto/0000-0003-4998-8008; Sanchez-Lavega, Agustin/0000-0001-7355-1522; Knoll, Ralph/0000-0001-8871-112X; saggin, bortolino/0000-0002-4033-3585; Tosi, Federico/0000-0003-4002-2434; Hueso, Ricardo/0000-0003-0169-123X; Lopez-Valverde, M.

The 60-100 km region (the mesosphere) is a transition region between the 4 day retrograde superrotation at the top of the thick clouds and the solar-antisolar circulation in the thermosphere (above 100 km), which has upwelling over the subsolar point and transport to the nightside(1,2). The mesosphere has a light haze of variable optical thickness, with CO, SO2, HCl, HF, H2O and HDO as the most important minor gaseous constituents, but the vertical distribution of the haze and molecules is poorly known because previous descent probes began their measurements at or below 60 km. Here we report the detection of an extensive layer of warm air at altitudes 90-120 km on the night side that we interpret as the result of adiabatic heating during air subsidence. Such a strong temperature inversion was not expected, because the night side of Venus was otherwise so cold that it was named the 'cryosphere' above 100 km. We also measured the mesospheric distributions of HF, HCl, H2O and HDO. HCl is less abundant than reported 40 years ago(3). HDO/H2O is enhanced by a factor of similar to 2.5 with respect to the lower atmosphere, and there is a general depletion of H2O around 80-90 km for which we have no explanation.","CNRS, IPSL, Serv Aeron, F-91371 Verrieres Le Buisson, France; Univ Paris 06, F-75252 Paris, France; Belgian Inst Space Aeron, B-1180 Brussels, Belgium; Space Res Inst, IKI, Moscow 117810, Russia; Univ Versailles St Quentin, Inst Pierre Simon Laplace, F-78280 Guyancourt, France; Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Fac Phys, Moscow 119992, Russia; Moscow Inst Phys & Technol, Dolgoprudnyi 141700, Russia","Bertaux, JL (reprint author), CNRS, IPSL, Serv Aeron, F-91371 Verrieres Le Buisson, France.",bertaux@aerov.jussieu.fr,"Hauchecorne, Alain/A-8489-2013; Fedorova, Anna/L-5116-2013; Korablev, Oleg/L-5083-2013; Rodin, Alexander/L-1904-2013; Belyaev, Denis/A-5404-2015; Korablev, Oleg/K-6770-2017","Rodin, Alexander/0000-0002-3601-7790; Belyaev, Denis/0000-0003-1123-5983; Korablev, Oleg/0000-0003-1115-0656; LEBONNOIS, SEBASTIEN/0000-0002-2390-8164; Vandaele, Ann Carine/0000-0001-8940-9301; Mahieux, Arnaud/0000-0001-5359-7179; Hauchecorne, Alain/0000-0001-9888-6994",,,,27,107,109,1,20,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,29-Nov,2007,450,7170,,,,,646,649,,10.1038/nature05974,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,235BY,WOS:000251209700037,18046397.0,No,,,11/20/17,a.,rodin,na,na,na,na,na

The high deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio in the venusian atmosphere relative to Earth's also indicates that the atmosphere has undergone significantly different evolution over the age of the Solar System(1). Present-day thermal escape is low for all atmospheric species. However, hydrogen can escape by means of collisions with hot atoms from ionospheric photochemistry(2), and although the bulk of O and O-2 are gravitationally bound, heavy ions have been observed to escape(3) through interaction with the solar wind. Nevertheless, their relative rates of escape, spatial distribution, and composition could not be determined from these previous measurements. Here we report Venus Express measurements showing that the dominant escaping ions are O+, He+ and H+. The escaping ions leave Venus through the plasma sheet (a central portion of the plasma wake) and in a boundary layer of the induced magnetosphere. The escape rate ratios are Q(H+)/Q(O+) = 1.9; Q(He+)/Q(O+) = 0.07. The first of these implies that the escape of H+ and O+, together with the estimated escape of neutral hydrogen and oxygen, currently takes place near the stoichometric ratio corresponding to water.","Swedish Inst Space Phys, S-98128 Kiruna, Sweden; Ctr Etud Spatiale Rayonnements, F-31028 Toulouse, France; Univ Calif Los Angeles, IGPP, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; Austrian Acad Sci, Space Res Inst, A-8042 Graz, Austria; Inst Space & Astronaut Sci, Sagamihara, Kanagawa 2298510, Japan; UCL, Mullard Space Sci Lab, Dorking RH5 6NT, Surrey, England; Univ Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; Aberystwyth Univ, Aberystwyth SY23 3BZ, Ceredigion, Wales; W Virginia Univ, Dept Phys, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; Univ Helsinki, Dept Phys Sci, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; Finnish Meteorol Inst, FIN-00101 Helsinki, Finland; Univ Michigan, Space Phys Res Lab, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Max Planck Inst Sonnensyst Forsch, D-37191 Katlenburg Lindau, Germany; Univ Calif Berkeley, Space Sci Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Natl Univ Ireland, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland; Ist Fis Spazio Interplanetario, I-00133 Rome, Italy; Johns Hopkins Univ, Appl Phys Lab, Laurel, MD 20723 USA; KFKI Res Inst Particle & Nucl Phys, H-1525 Budapest 114, Hungary; SW Res Inst, San Antonio, TX 78228 USA; Univ Bern, Inst Phys, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland","Barabash, S (reprint author), Swedish Inst Space Phys, S-98128 Kiruna, Sweden.",stas@irf.se,"Baumjohann, Wolfgang/A-1012-2010; Coates, Andrew/C-2396-2008; Gunell, Herbert/D-5611-2013; Futaana, Yoshifumi/P-5899-2014; Grande, Manuel/C-2242-2013; Kallio, Esa/F-9410-2014; Koskinen, Hannu/B-4971-2017","Baumjohann, Wolfgang/0000-0001-6271-0110; Coates, Andrew/0000-0002-6185-3125; Futaana, Yoshifumi/0000-0002-7056-3517; Grande, Manuel/0000-0002-2233-2618; Kallio, Esa/0000-0002-9791-804X; Koskinen, Hannu/0000-0003-3839-6461; Gunell, Herbert/0000-0001-5379-1158; Russell, Christopher/0000-0003-1639-8298",Science and Technology Facilities Council [PP/D000831/1],,,22,94,94,1,15,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,29-Nov,2007,450,7170,,,,,650,653,,10.1038/nature06434,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,235BY,WOS:000251209700038,18046398.0,No,,,11/20/17,p.,bochsler,na,na,na,na,na

A field is induced in this interaction, which partially shields the atmosphere, but we have no knowledge of how effective that shield is at solar minimum. (Our current knowledge of the solar wind interaction with Venus is derived from measurements at solar maximum(4-7).) The bow shock is close to the planet, meaning that it is possible that some solar wind could be absorbed by the atmosphere and contribute to the evolution of the atmosphere(8,9). Here we report magnetic field measurements from the Venus Express spacecraft(4) in the plasma environment surrounding Venus. The bow shock under low solar activity conditions seems to be in the position that would be expected from a complete deflection by a magnetized ionosphere(10). Therefore little solar wind enters the Venus ionosphere even at solar minimum.","Austrian Acad Sci, Space Res Inst, A-8042 Graz, Austria; TU Braunschweig, Inst Geophys & Extraterr Phys, D-3300 Braunschweig, Germany; TU Braunschweig, Inst Theoret Phys, D-3300 Braunschweig, Germany; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci & Technol, London SW7 2BZ, England; Univ Calif Los Angeles, IGPP, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; Swedish Inst Space Phys, S-98128 Kiruna, Sweden; Univ Sheffield, Sheffield S1 3JD, S Yorkshire, England; Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Expt Phys, Kosice 04353, Slovakia; Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Space Weather, Beijing 100080, Peoples R China; RSSD ESTEC, NL-2000 AG Noordwijk, Netherlands","Zhang, TL (reprint author), Austrian Acad Sci, Space Res Inst, A-8042 Graz, Austria.",tielong.zhang@oeaw.ac.at,"Pope, Simon/E-5855-2011; Baumjohann, Wolfgang/A-1012-2010; Nakamura, Rumi/I-7712-2013","Pope, Simon/0000-0001-8130-4222; Baumjohann, Wolfgang/0000-0001-6271-0110; Nakamura, Rumi/0000-0002-2620-9211; Voros, Zoltan/0000-0001-7597-238X",,,,20,54,54,0,9,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,29-Nov,2007,450,7170,,,,,654,656,,10.1038/nature06026,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,235BY,WOS:000251209700039,18046399.0,No,,,11/20/17,j. -p.,lebreton,na,na,na,na,na

Hence, new principles must in these cases be invoked to account for the mechanical force driving membrane shape changes. Here we show that the Gb3 (glycolipid)-binding B-subunit of bacterial Shiga toxin induces narrow tubular membrane invaginations in human and mouse cells and model membranes. In cells, tubule occurrence increases on energy depletion and inhibition of dynamin or actin functions. Our data thus demonstrate that active cellular processes are needed for tubule scission rather than tubule formation. We conclude that the B-subunit induces lipid reorganization that favours negative membrane curvature, which drives the formation of inward membrane tubules. Our findings support a model in which the lateral growth of B-subunit-Gb3 microdomains is limited by the invagination process, which itself is regulated by membrane tension. The physical principles underlying this basic cargo-induced membrane uptake may also be relevant to other internalization processes, creating a rationale for conceptualizing the perplexing diversity of endocytic routes.","Inst Curie, Ctr Rech, Lab Traf Signalisat & Ciblage Intracellulaires, F-75248 Paris 05, France; Inst Curie, Ctr Rech, Lab Physicochim, F-75248 Paris, France; Inst Curie, Ctr Rech, Lab Struct & Compartiments Membranaires, F-75248 Paris 05, France; Inst Curie, Ctr Rech, Lab Chim Organ Vectorisat, F-75248 Paris 05, France; Univ Paris 06, CNRS, UMR168, F-75252 Paris 05, France; CNRS, UMR176, F-75700 Paris, France; Univ New S Wales, Ctr Vasc Res, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; Prince Wales Hosp, Dept Haematol, Sydney, NSW 2031, Australia; Univ Gottingen, Inst Organ & Biomol Chem, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; CNRS, UMR 5091, Lab Physiol Cellulaire Synapse, F-33077 Bordeaux, France; Univ Bordeaux 2, Inst Francois Magendie, F-33077 Bordeaux, France; CNRS, ESPCI, UMR Gulliver 7083, F-75231 Paris 05, France","Johannes, L (reprint author), Inst Curie, Ctr Rech, Lab Traf Signalisat & Ciblage Intracellulaires, 26 Rue Ulm, F-75248 Paris 05, France.",johannes@curie.fr,"sens, pierre/C-3537-2011; Wunder, Stephanie/B-5066-2012; Zdilla, Michael/B-4145-2011; Johannes, Ludger/M-9778-2017; Lamaze, Christophe/M-4912-2017","sens, pierre/0000-0003-4523-3791; Johannes, Ludger/0000-0002-2168-0004; Perrais, David/0000-0002-5878-5408; Bassereau, Patricia/0000-0002-8544-6778",,,,50,311,313,5,60,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,29-Nov,2007,450,7170,,,,,670,U3,,10.1038/nature05996,,9,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,235BY,WOS:000251209700045,18046403.0,No,,,11/20/17,ludger,johannes,na,na,na,na,na

Here we report a quantitative description of asynchronous neurotransmitter release in calyx-of-Held synapses. We show that deletion of synaptotagmin 2 (Syt2) in mice selectively abolishes synchronous release, allowing us to study pure asynchronous release in isolation. Using photolysis experiments of caged Ca2+, we demonstrate that asynchronous release displays a Ca2+ cooperativity of similar to 2 with a Ca2+ affinity of similar to 44 mu M, in contrast to synchronous release, which exhibits a Ca2+ cooperativity of similar to 5 with a Ca2+ affinity of similar to 38 mu M. Our results reveal that release triggered in wild-type synapses at low Ca2+ concentrations is physiologically asynchronous, and that asynchronous release completely empties the readily releasable pool of vesicles during sustained elevations of Ca2+.

Analysis of the ensemble produces a detailed architectural map of the assembly. We developed our approach on a challenging model system, the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The NPC acts as a dynamic barrier, controlling access to and from the nucleus, and in yeast is a 50 MDa assembly of 456 proteins.

Our structure reveals that half of the NPC is made up of a core scaffold, which is structurally analogous to vesicle-coating complexes. This scaffold forms an interlaced network that coats the entire curved surface of the nuclear envelope membrane within which the NPC is embedded. The selective barrier for transport is formed by large numbers of proteins with disordered regions that line the inner face of the scaffold. The NPC consists of only a few structural modules that resemble each other in terms of the configuration of their homologous constituents, the most striking of these being a 16-fold repetition of 'columns'.

Because the molecular movement in the pore system is the most important and defining characteristic of porous materials(8), it is of interest to learn about this behaviour as a function of local structure. Generally, individual fluorescent dye molecules can be used as molecular beacons with which to explore the structure of-and the dynamics within-these porous hosts(9-13), and single-molecule fluorescence techniques provide detailed insights into the dynamics of various processes, ranging from biology(14,15) to heterogeneous catalysis(16). However, optical microscopy methods cannot directly image the mesoporous structure of the host system accommodating the diffusing molecules, whereas transmission electron microscopy provides detailed images of the porous structure(17), but no dynamic information. It has therefore not been possible to 'see' how molecules diffuse in a real nanoscale pore structure. Here we present a combination of electron microscopic mapping and optical single-molecule tracking experiments to reveal how a single luminescent dye molecule travels through linear or strongly curved sections of a mesoporous channel system.

Bruce",,,A diffusion mechanism for core-mantle interaction,NATURE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,GRAIN-BOUNDARIES; CONSTRAINTS; EARTH,"Understanding the geochemical behaviour of the siderophile elements - those tending to form alloys with iron in natural environments - is important in the search for a deep-mantle chemical 'fingerprint' in upper mantle rocks, and also in the evaluation of models of large-scale differentiation of the Earth and terrestrial planets. These elements are highly concentrated in the core relative to the silicate mantle, but their concentrations in upper mantle rocks are higher than predicted by most core-formation models(1,2). It has been suggested that mixing of outer-core material back into the mantle following core formation may be responsible for the siderophile element ratios observed in upper mantle rocks(3). Such re-mixing has been attributed to an unspecified metal - silicate interaction in the reactive D"" layer just above the core - mantle boundary(4). The siderophile elements are excellent candidates as indicators of an outer-core contribution to the mantle, but the nature and existence of possible core - mantle interactions is controversial(5). In light of the recent findings that grain-boundary diffusion of oxygen through a dry intergranular medium may be effective over geologically significant length scales(6) and that grain boundaries can be primary storage sites for incompatible lithophile elements(7), the question arises as to whether siderophile elements might exhibit similar (or greater) grain-boundary mobility. Here we report experimental results from a study of grain-boundary diffusion of siderophile elements through polycrystalline MgO that were obtained by quantifying the extent of alloy formation between initially pure metals separated by similar to 1 mm of polycrystalline MgO. Grain-boundary diffusion resulted in significant alloying of sink and source particles, enabling calculation of grain-boundary fluxes.

SIRT1, an NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase, is a principal modulator of pathways downstream of calorie restriction that produce beneficial effects on glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity(3-9). Resveratrol, a polyphenolic SIRT1 activator, mimics the anti-ageing effects of calorie restriction in lower organisms and in mice fed a high-fat diet ameliorates insulin resistance, increases mitochondrial content, and prolongs survival10-14. Here we describe the identification and characterization of small molecule activators of SIRT1 that are structurally unrelated to, and 1,000-fold more potent than, resveratrol. These compounds bind to the SIRT1 enzyme-peptide substrate complex at an allosteric site amino-terminal to the catalytic domain and lower the Michaelis constant for acetylated substrates. In diet-induced obese and genetically obese mice, these compounds improve insulin sensitivity, lower plasma glucose, and increase mitochondrial capacity. In Zucker fa/fa rats, hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp studies demonstrate that SIRT1 activators improve whole-body glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and liver. Thus, SIRT1 activation is a promising new therapeutic approach for treating diseases of ageing such as type 2 diabetes.","Sirtris Pharmaceut Inc, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Med, Div Endocrinol & Metab, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Paul F Glenn Labs Biol Mech Aging, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Westphal, CH (reprint author), Sirtris Pharmaceut Inc, 790 Mem Dr, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",cwestphal@sirtrispharma.com,,"Schenk, Simon/0000-0002-8224-3203; Sinclair, David/0000-0002-9936-436X","NIA NIH HHS [R01 AG019719-07, P01 AG027916, P01 AG027916-030003, P01 AG027916-040003, R01 AG019719, R01 AG028730, R01 AG028730-02, R01 AG028730-03]",,,28,982,1031,9,170,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,29-Nov,2007,450,7170,,,,,712,716,,10.1038/nature06261,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,235BY,WOS:000251209700052,18046409.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,christoph h.,westphal,na,na,na,na,na

The activity of a morphogen has generally been viewed as a concentration-dependent response to a diffusible signal, but the duration of morphogen signalling can also affect cellular responses(3). One such example is the morphogen sonic hedgehog (SHH). In the vertebrate central nervous system and limbs, the pattern of cellular differentiation is controlled by both the amount and the time of SHH exposure(4-7). How these two parameters are interpreted at a cellular level has been unclear. Here we provide evidence that changing the concentration or duration of SHH has an equivalent effect on intracellular signalling. Chick neural cells convert different concentrations of SHH into time-limited periods of signal transduction, such that signal duration is proportional to SHH concentration. This depends on the gradual desensitization of cells to ongoing SHH exposure, mediated by the SHH-dependent upregulation of patched 1 (PTC1), a ligand-binding inhibitor of SHH signalling(8). Thus, in addition to its role in shaping the SHH gradient(8-10), PTC1 participates cell autonomously in gradient sensing. Together, the data reveal a novel strategy for morphogen interpretation, in which the temporal adaptation of cells to a morphogen integrates the concentration and duration of a signal to control differential gene expression.","Natl Inst Med Res, London NW7 1AA, England; Univ Michigan, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Briscoe, J (reprint author), Natl Inst Med Res, Mill Hill, London NW7 1AA, England.",james.briscoe@nimr.mrc.ac.uk,,"Novitch, Bennett/0000-0002-2696-3708; Dessaud, Eric/0000-0001-9723-6658; Briscoe, James/0000-0002-1020-5240",Medical Research Council [MC_U117560541]; NINDS NIH HHS [R01 NS072804],,,33,256,258,0,16,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,29-Nov,2007,450,7170,,,,,717,U7,,10.1038/nature06347,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,235BY,WOS:000251209700053,18046410.0,No,,,11/20/17,james,briscoe,male,0.99,6359,VJ83sekAAAAJ,14198

However, little is known about its normal physiological function. Here we show that p53 is important in reproduction, in a gender-specific manner. Significant decreases in embryonic implantation, pregnancy rate and litter size were observed in matings with p53(-/-) female mice but not with p53(-/-) male mice. The gene encoding leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a cytokine critical for implantation(2), was identified as a p53-regulated gene that functions as the downstream mediator of this effect. p53 can regulate both basal and inducible transcription of LIF. Loss of p53 decreased both the level and function of LIF in uteri. Lower LIF levels were observed in the uteri of p53(-/-) mice than in those of p53(+/+) mice, particularly at day 4 of pregnancy, when transiently induced high levels of LIF were crucial for embryonic implantation. This observation probably accounts for the impaired implantation of embryos in p53(-/-) female mice. Administration of LIF to pregnant p53(-/-) mice restored maternal reproduction by improving implantation. These results demonstrate a function for p53 in maternal reproduction through the regulation of LIF. Evidence is accumulating that p53 may have a similar function in humans.","Univ Med & Dent New Jersey, Canc Inst New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USA; Inst Adv Study, Simons Ctr Syst Biol, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA","Levine, AJ (reprint author), Univ Med & Dent New Jersey, Canc Inst New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USA.",alevine@ias.edu,,,,,,19,217,229,0,14,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,29-Nov,2007,450,7170,,,,,721,U8,,10.1038/nature05993,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,235BY,WOS:000251209700054,18046411.0,No,,,11/20/17,arnold j.,levine,na,na,na,na,na

Current antibiotics typically target pathogen rather than host-specific biochemical pathways(1). Here we have developed kinase inhibitors that prevent intracellular growth of unrelated pathogens such as Salmonella typhimurium and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. An RNA interference screen of the human kinome using automated microscopy revealed several host kinases capable of inhibiting intracellular growth of S. typhimurium. The kinases identified clustered in one network around AKT1 (also known as PKB). Inhibitors of AKT1 prevent intracellular growth of various bacteria including MDR-M. tuberculosis. AKT1 is activated by the S. typhimurium effector SopB, which promotes intracellular survival by controlling actin dynamics through PAK4, and phagosome-lysosome fusion through the AS160 (also known as TBC1D4)-RAB14 pathway. AKT1 inhibitors counteract the bacterial manipulation of host signalling processes, thus controlling intracellular growth of bacteria. By using a reciprocal chemical genetics approach, we identified kinase inhibitors with antibiotic properties and their host targets, and we determined host signalling networks that are activated by intracellular bacteria for survival.","Netherlands Canc Inst, Div Tumor Biol, NL-1066 CX Amsterdam, Netherlands; Netherlands Canc Inst, Div Mol Carcinogenesis, NL-1066 CX Amsterdam, Netherlands; Leiden Med Univ Ctr, Dept Immunohematol & Blood Transfus, NL-2333 ZA Leiden, Netherlands; Leiden Med Univ Ctr, Dept Infect Dis, NL-2333 ZA Leiden, Netherlands; Leiden Univ, Leiden Inst Chem, Bioorgan Chem Lab, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands","Neefjes, J (reprint author), Netherlands Canc Inst, Div Tumor Biol, Plesmanlaan 121, NL-1066 CX Amsterdam, Netherlands.",j.neefjes@nki.nl,,"Neefjes, Jacques/0000-0001-6763-2211; Overkleeft, Herman/0000-0001-6976-7005; Kuijl, Coen/0000-0003-4378-1428",,,,48,174,178,0,19,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,29-Nov,2007,450,7170,,,,,725,U10,,10.1038/nature06345,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,235BY,WOS:000251209700055,18046412.0,No,,,11/20/17,jacques,neefjes,male,0.99,280,8Q8LNm8AAAAJ,26905

During thymocyte development, cell fate is determined by signals originating from the alpha beta T-cell receptor. Low-affinity/avidity interactions between the T-cell receptor and peptide-MHC complexes direct differentiation to the single-positive stage (positive selection), whereas high-affinity/avidity interactions induce death by apoptosis (negative selection)(1,2). Here we show that mice deficient in both calcineurin and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) c2/c3 lack a population of preselection thymocytes with enhanced ability to activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (Raf-MEK-ERK) pathway, and fail to undergo positive selection. This defect can be partially rescued with constitutively active Raf, indicating that calcineurin controls MAPK signalling. Analysis of mice deficient in both Bim (which is required for negative selection) and calcineurin revealed that calcineurin-induced ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) sensitization is required for differentiation in response to 'weak' positive selecting signals but not in response to 'strong' negative selecting signals (which normally induce apoptosis). These results indicate that early calcineurin/NFAT signalling produces a developmental period of ERK hypersensitivity, allowing very weak signals to induce positive selection. This mechanism might be generally useful in the discrimination of graded signals that induce different cell fates.","Stanford Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Dept Pathol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Dept Dev Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Program Immunol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Univ Washington, Sch Med, Dept Comparat Med, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Stanford Univ, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Crabtree, GR (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",crabtree@stanford.edu,,,"NCRR NIH HHS [K26 RR024462]; NIAID NIH HHS [K08 AI001445, R01 AI053568, T32 AI007290]; NIH HHS [K26 OD011060]",,,28,41,41,0,2,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,29-Nov,2007,450,7170,,,,,731,U11,,10.1038/nature06305,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,235BY,WOS:000251209700056,18046413.0,No,,,11/20/17,gerald r.,crabtree,na,na,na,na,na

An important component in the energy and nutrient pathways is mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a kinase that regulates cell growth, size and survival(3-5). However, it is unknown whether and how mTOR controls mitochondrial oxidative activities. Here we show that mTOR is necessary for the maintenance of mitochondrial oxidative function. In skeletal muscle tissues and cells, the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin decreased the gene expression of the mitochondrial transcriptional regulators PGC-1 alpha, oestrogen-related receptor a and nuclear respiratory factors, resulting in a decrease in mitochondrial gene expression and oxygen consumption. Using computational genomics, we identified the transcription factor yin-yang 1 (YY1) as a common target of mTOR and PGC-1 alpha. Knockdown of YY1 caused a significant decrease in mitochondrial gene expression and in respiration, and YY1 was required for rapamycin-dependent repression of those genes. Moreover, mTOR and raptor interacted with YY1, and inhibition of mTOR resulted in a failure of YY1 to interact with and be coactivated by PGC-1 alpha. We have therefore identified a mechanism by which a nutrient sensor (mTOR) balances energy metabolism by means of the transcriptional control of mitochondrial oxidative function. These results have important implications for our understanding of how these pathways might be altered in metabolic diseases and cancer.","Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; Harvard Univ, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Sch Med, Dept Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; Harvard Univ, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Sch Med, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA; MIT, Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Puigserver, P (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, 44 Binney St, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",vamsi@hms.harvard.edu; pere_puigserver@dfci.harvard.edu,,"Cunningham, John/0000-0001-6490-4533",,,,30,598,619,3,59,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,29-Nov,2007,450,7170,,,,,736,U12,,10.1038/nature06322,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,235BY,WOS:000251209700057,18046414.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,pere,puigserver,male,0.97,36,DjD492gAAAAJ,46437

The cytoplasmic protein MIG6 (mitogen-induced gene 6; also known as ERRFI1) interacts with and inhibits the kinase domains of EGFR and ERBB2 (refs 3-5). Crystal structures of complexes between the EGFR kinase domain and a fragment of MIG6 show that a similar to 25-residue epitope (segment 1) from MIG6 binds to the distal surface of the Clobe of the kinase domain. Biochemical and cell-based analyses confirm that this interaction contributes to EGFR inhibition by blocking the formation of the activating dimer interface. A longer MIG6 peptide that is extended C terminal to segment 1 has increased potency as an inhibitor of the activated EGFR kinase domain, while retaining a critical dependence on segment 1.

On bi-oriented chromosomes, kinetochores (macromolecular complexes that attach the chromosome to the spindle) reside on the opposite sides of the chromosome's centromere(2). In contrast, sister kinetochores shift towards one side of the centromere on 'syntelic' chromosomes that erroneously attach to one spindle pole with both sister kinetochores. Syntelic attachments often arise during spindle assembly and must be corrected to prevent chromosome loss(3). It is assumed that restoration of proper centromere architecture occurs automatically owing to elastic properties of the centromere(1,2). Here we test this assumption by combining laser microsurgery and chemical biology assays in cultured mammalian cells. We find that kinetochores of syntelic chromosomes remain juxtaposed on detachment from spindle microtubules. These findings reveal that correction of syntelic attachments involves an extra step that has previously been overlooked: external forces must be applied to move sister kinetochores to the opposite sides of the centromere. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the shape of the centromere is important for spindle assembly, because bipolar spindles do not form in cells lacking centrosomes when multiple chromosomes with juxtaposed kinetochores are present. Thus, proper architecture of the centromere makes an important contribution to achieving high fidelity of chromosome segregation.","New York State Dept Hlth, Wadsworth Ctr, Div Mol Med, Albany, NY 12201 USA; SUNY Albany, Dept Biomed Sci, Albany, NY 12222 USA; Rockefeller Univ, Lab Chem & Cell Biol, New York, NY 10021 USA","Khodjakov, A (reprint author), New York State Dept Hlth, Wadsworth Ctr, Div Mol Med, Albany, NY 12201 USA.",kapoor@rockefeller.edu; khodj@wadsworth.org,,,"NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM059363, R01 GM059363-09, R01 GM065933]",,,31,60,61,0,7,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,29-Nov,2007,450,7170,,,,,745,U14,,10.1038/nature06344,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,235BY,WOS:000251209700059,18046416.0,No,,,11/20/17,alexey,khodjakov,male,1,45,na,na

The mechanism of processive motility involves the hand-over-hand motion of the two motor domains ('heads')(5-7), a process driven by a conformational change in the neck-linker domain of kinesin(8-12.) However, the 'waiting conformation' of kinesin between steps remains controversial(13-16)-some models propose that kinesin adopts a one-head-bound intermediate(17-21), whereas others suggest that both the kinesin heads are bound to adjacent tubulin subunits(7,22,23). Addressing this question has proved challenging, in part because of a lack of tools to measure structural states of the kinesin dimer as it moves along a microtubule. Here we develop two different single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) sensors to detect whether kinesin is bound to its microtubule track by one or two heads. Our FRET results indicate that, while moving in the presence of saturating ATP, kinesin spends most of its time bound to the microtubule with both heads. However, when nucleotide binding becomes rate-limiting at low ATP concentrations, kinesin waits for ATP in a one-head-bound state and makes brief transitions to a two-head-bound intermediate as it walks along the microtubule. On the basis of these results, we suggest a model for how transitions in the ATPase cycle position the two kinesin heads and drive their hand-over-hand motion.","Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; Univ Tokyo, Dept Appl Phys, Tokyo 1138656, Japan; Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Mol & Cellular Pharmacol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA","Vale, RD (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA.",vale@cmp.ucsf.edu,,,,,,28,91,94,1,22,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,29-Nov,2007,450,7170,,,,,750,U15,,10.1038/nature06346,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,235BY,WOS:000251209700060,18004302.0,No,,,11/20/17,michio,tomishige,male,1,2,na,na

Both cell lines exhibited normal ES cell morphology, expressed key stem-cell markers, were transcriptionally similar to control ES cells and differentiated into multiple cell types in vitro and in vivo.

In the olfactory bulb, each glomerulus represents a single species of odorant receptor. Because a single odorant can interact with several different receptor species, the odour information received in the olfactory epithelium is converted to a topographical map of multiple glomeruli activated in distinct areas in the olfactory bulb. To study how the odour map is interpreted in the brain, we generated mutant mice in which olfactory sensory neurons in a specific area of the olfactory epithelium are ablated by targeted expression of the diphtheria toxin gene. Here we show that, in dorsal-zone-depleted mice, the dorsal domain of the olfactory bulb was devoid of glomerular structures, although second-order neurons were present in the vacant areas. The mutant mice lacked innate responses to aversive odorants, even though they were capable of detecting them and could be conditioned for aversion with the remaining glomeruli. These results indicate that, in mice, aversive information is received in the olfactory bulb by separate sets of glomeruli, those dedicated for innate and those for learned responses.","Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biophys & Biochem, Tokyo 1130032, Japan; Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; Osaka Univ, Microbial Dis Res Inst, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; RIKEN, Brain Sci Inst, Lab Behav Genet, Saitama 3510198, Japan; Univ Tokyo, Lab Vet Ethol, Tokyo 1138657, Japan","Sakano, H (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biophys & Biochem, Tokyo 1130032, Japan.",sakano@mail.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"ikawa, masahito/A-5315-2009; Itohara, Shigeyoshi/I-8769-2012; Imai, Takeshi/L-2201-2013; Okabe, Masaru/B-6917-2015; Oka, Yoshitaka/G-4952-2014","ikawa, masahito/0000-0001-9859-6217; Itohara, Shigeyoshi/0000-0002-2410-9989; Imai, Takeshi/0000-0002-8449-0080; Okabe, Masaru/0000-0002-0803-9044; Oka, Yoshitaka/0000-0002-3482-3051",,,,44,295,298,2,55,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Nov,2007,450,7169,,,,,503,U5,,10.1038/nature06281,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,234JW,WOS:000251158500037,17989651.0,No,,,11/20/17,hitoshi,sakano,male,1,5,na,na

Previous work has implicated the MRE11 complex in such DSB-processing events. Here, we show that the human CtIP (RBBP8) protein confers resistance to DSB-inducing agents and is recruited to DSBs exclusively in the S and G2 cell-cycle phases. Moreover, we reveal that CtIP is required for DSB resection, and thereby for recruitment of replication protein A (RPA) and the protein kinase ATR to DSBs, and for the ensuing ATR activation. Furthermore, we establish that CtIP physically and functionally interacts with the MRE11 complex, and that both CtIP and MRE11 are required for efficient homologous recombination. Finally, we reveal that CtIP has sequence homology with Sae2, which is involved in MRE11-dependent DSB processing in yeast. These findings establish evolutionarily conserved roles for CtIP-like proteins in controlling DSB resection, checkpoint signalling and homologous recombination.","Univ Cambridge, Wellcome Trust & Canc Res UK Gurdon Inst, Cambridge CB2 1QN, England; Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Cambridge CB2 1QN, England; Danish Canc Soc, Inst Canc Biol, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; Danish Canc Soc, Ctr Genotox Stress Res, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; Columbia Univ, Dept Pathol, Inst Canc Genet, New York, NY 10032 USA","Sartori, AA (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Wellcome Trust & Canc Res UK Gurdon Inst, Tennis Court Rd, Cambridge CB2 1QN, England.",s.jackson@gurdon.cam.ac.uk,"Bartek, Jiri/G-5870-2014; Dry, Kate/I-2328-2014","Lukas, Jiri/0000-0001-9087-506X; Lukas, Claudia/0000-0001-7169-6883; Jackson, Stephen Philip/0000-0001-9317-7937; Sartori, Alessandro/0000-0003-2770-0333",Cancer Research UK [A5290]; NCI NIH HHS [P01 CA097403],,,49,674,684,3,34,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Nov,2007,450,7169,,,,,509,U6,,10.1038/nature06337,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,234JW,WOS:000251158500038,17965729.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,stephen p.,jackson,na,na,na,na,na

This structure, stabilized by a mutation that prevents ATP hydrolysis, captures the ATP-binding cassette dimer in a closed, ATP-bound conformation. Maltose is occluded within a solvent-filled cavity at the interface of the two transmembrane subunits, about halfway into the lipid bilayer. The binding protein docks onto the entrance of the cavity in an open conformation and serves as a cap to ensure unidirectional translocation of the sugar molecule.

The theory of stellar evolution predicts that the majority of white dwarfs have a core made of carbon and oxygen, which itself is surrounded by a helium layer and, for similar to 80 per cent of known white dwarfs, by an additional hydrogen layer(1-3). All white dwarfs therefore have been traditionally found to belong to one of two categories: those with a hydrogen-rich atmosphere ( the DA spectral type) and those with a helium-rich atmosphere (the non-DAs). Here we report the discovery of several white dwarfs with atmospheres primarily composed of carbon, with little or no trace of hydrogen or helium. Our analysis shows that the atmospheric parameters found for these stars do not fit satisfactorily in any of the currently known theories of post-asymptotic giant branch evolution, although these objects might be the cooler counterpart of the unique and extensively studied PG 1159 star H15041+65 (refs 4-7).

Planetary-scale magma oceans are thought to have formed during early stages of differentiation, but the longevity of such magma oceans is poorly constrained. In Mars, the absence of vigorous convection and plate tectonics has limited the scale of compositional mixing within its interior(2), thus preserving the early stages of planetary differentiation. The SNC ( Shergotty-Nakhla-Chassigny) meteorites from Mars retain 'memory' of these events(3-5). Here we apply the short-lived Sm-146-Nd-142 and the long-lived Sm-147-Nd-143 chronometers to a suite of shergottites to unravel the history of early silicate differentiation in Mars. Our data are best explained by progressive crystallization of a magma ocean with a duration of similar to 100 million years after core formation.

One prime example is Bose-Einstein condensation, whose onset in a quantum liquid leads to phenomena such as superfluidity and superconductivity. A Bose-Einstein condensate is generally defined as a macroscopic occupation of a single-particle quantum state, a phenomenon technically referred to as off-diagonal long-range order due to non-vanishing off-diagonal components of the single-particle density matrix(1-3). The wave-function of the condensate is an order parameter whose phase is essential in characterizing the coherence and superfluid phenomena(4-11). The long-range spatial coherence leads to the existence of phase-locked multiple condensates in an array of superfluid helium(12), superconducting Josephson junctions(13-15) or atomic Bose-Einstein condensates(15-18). Under certain circumstances, a quantum phase difference of p is predicted to develop among weakly coupled Josephson junctions(19). Such a meta-stable pi-state was discovered in a weak link of superfluid 3 He, which is characterized by a 'p-wave' order parameter(20). The possible existence of such a pi-state in weakly coupled atomic Bose-Einstein condensates has also been proposed(21), but remains undiscovered. Here we report the observation of spontaneous build-up of in-phase ('zero-state') and antiphase ('pi-state') 'superfluid' states in a solid-state system; an array of exciton-polariton condensates connected by weak periodic potential barriers within a semiconductor microcavity. These in-phase and antiphase states reflect the band structure of the one-dimensional polariton array and the dynamic characteristics of metastable exciton-polariton condensates.","Stanford Univ, Edward L Ginzton Lab, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Univ Tokyo, Inst Ind Sci, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1538505, Japan; Natl Inst Informat, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1018430, Japan; NTT Corp, NTT Basic Res Labs, Kanagawa 2430198, Japan","Lai, CW (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Edward L Ginzton Lab, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",cwlai@stanford.edu; yyamamoto@stanford.edu,"Kim, Na Young/A-8115-2008; Deng, Hui/A-7115-2009; Deng, Hui/E-8950-2010; Yamamoto, Yoshihisa/A-2811-2012; Lai, Chih Wei/E-4945-2010; Fujisawa, Toshimasa/M-2428-2013","Deng, Hui/0000-0003-0629-3230; Lai, Chih Wei/0000-0003-3571-4671; Fujisawa, Toshimasa/0000-0002-0451-6579",,,,29,243,243,6,62,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Nov,2007,450,7169,,,,,529,U8,,10.1038/nature06334,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,234JW,WOS:000251158500042,18033292.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,y.,yamamoto,na,na,na,na,na

The underlying evolution of the electron system in the absence of superconductivity is still unclear, and a question of central importance is whether it involves any intermediate phase with broken symmetry(1). The Fermi surface of the electronic states in the underdoped 'YBCO' materials YBa2Cu3Oy and YBa2Cu4O8 was recently shown to include small pockets(2-4), in contrast with the large cylinder that characterizes the overdoped regime(5), pointing to a topological change in the Fermi surface. Here we report the observation of a negative Hall resistance in the magnetic-field-induced normal state of YBa2Cu3Oy and YBa2Cu4O8, which reveals that these pockets are electron-like rather than hole-like. We propose that these electron pockets most probably arise from a reconstruction of the Fermi surface caused by the onset of a density-wave phase, as is thought to occur in the electron-doped copper oxides near the onset of antiferromagnetic order(6,7). Comparison with materials of the La2CuO4 family that exhibit spin/charge density-wave order(8-11) suggests that a Fermi surface reconstruction also occurs in those materials, pointing to a generic property of high-transition-temperature (T-c) superconductors.","INSA, UPS, CNRS, UMR 5147,LNCMP, F-31400 Toulouse, France; Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Phys, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada; Univ Sherbrooke, RQMP, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada; Univ Bristol, HH Wills Phys Lab, Bristol BS8 1TL, Avon, England; Florida State Univ, MHMFL, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; Univ British Columbia, Dept Phys & Astron, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; Canadian Inst Adv Res, Toronto, ON M5G 1Z8, Canada; Int Superconduct Technol Ctr, Superconduct Res Lab, Koto Ku, Tokyo 1350062, Japan","Proust, C (reprint author), INSA, UPS, CNRS, UMR 5147,LNCMP, F-31400 Toulouse, France.",proust@lncmp.org; louis.taillefer@physique.usherbrooke.ca,"Balicas, Luis/A-3110-2008; Ramshaw, Brad/J-3121-2013; Hussey, Nigel/F-9699-2015","Ramshaw, Brad/0000-0002-3222-5007; ",,,,30,331,331,13,111,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Nov,2007,450,7169,,,,,533,536,,10.1038/nature06332,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,234JW,WOS:000251158500043,18033293.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,louis,taillefer,male,0.99,654,RWE2aeEAAAAJ,14561

All of these hypotheses imply that DOC levels will continue to rise, with unpredictable consequences for the global carbon cycle. Alternatively, it has been proposed that DOC concentrations are returning toward pre-industrial levels as a result of a gradual decline in the sulphate content of atmospheric deposition(8-10). Here we show, through the assessment of time series data from 522 remote lakes and streams in North America and northern Europe, that rising trends in DOC between 1990 and 2004 can be concisely explained by a simple model based solely on changes in deposition chemistry and catchment acid-sensitivity. We demonstrate that DOC concentrations have increased in proportion to the rates at which atmospherically deposited anthropogenic sulphur and sea salt have declined. We conclude that acid deposition to these ecosystems has been partially buffered by changes in organic acidity and that the rise in DOC is integral to recovery from acidification. Over recent decades, deposition-driven increases in organic matter solubility may have increased the export of DOC to the oceans, a potentially important component of regional carbon balances(11). The increase in DOC concentrations in these regions appears unrelated to other climatic factors.","UCL, Environm Change Res Ctr, London WC1E 6BT, England; US EPA, Corvallis, OR 97333 USA; Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales; Norwegian Inst Water Res, N-0349 Oslo, Norway; Finnish Environm Inst, FI-00251 Helsinki, Finland; Dept Environm Assessment SLU, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; Environm Canada, Burlington, ON L7R 4A6, Canada; Laurentian Univ, Ontario Minist Environm, Sudbury, ON P3E 2C6, Canada; Acad Sci Czech Republic, Inst Hydrobiol, Ctr Biol, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic; Czech Geol Survey, Prague 15200, Czech Republic","Monteith, DT (reprint author), UCL, Environm Change Res Ctr, Mortimer St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",dmonteit@geog.ucl.ac.uk,"Evans, Christopher/F-2087-2010; Monteith, Donald/C-1534-2008; Keller, Wendel/G-1533-2012; Kopacek, Jiri/A-7373-2014","Evans, Christopher/0000-0002-7052-354X; de Wit, Heleen A/0000-0001-5646-5390; Monteith, Donald/0000-0003-3219-1772; Stoddard, John/0000-0002-2537-6130",,,,30,728,742,52,588,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Nov,2007,450,7169,,,,,537,U9,,10.1038/nature06316,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,234JW,WOS:000251158500044,18033294.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,josef,vesely,male,0.99,104,KngfMzYAAAAJ,na

Individual flow deposits have been mapped that extend for 1,500 km offshore from northwest Africa(1-7). These are the longest run-out sediment density flow deposits yet documented on Earth. This contribution analyses one of these deposits, which contains ten times the mass of sediment transported annually by all of the world's rivers(8). Understanding how this type of submarine flow evolves is a significant problem, because they are extremely difficult to monitor directly(9). Previous work has shown how progressive disintegration of landslide blocks can generate debris flow, the deposit of which extends downslope from the original landslide(10) (10-13). We provide evidence that submarine flows can produce giant debris flow deposits that start several hundred kilometres from the original landslide, encased within deposits of a more dilute flow type called turbidity current. Very little sediment was deposited across the intervening large expanse of sea floor, where the flow was locally very erosive. Sediment deposition was finally triggered by a remarkably small but abrupt decrease in sea-floor gradient from 0.05 degrees to 0.01 degrees. This debris flow was probably generated by flow transformation from the decelerating turbidity current. The alternative is that non-channelized debris flow left almost no trace of its passage across one hundred kilometres of flat (0.2 degrees to 0.05 degrees) sea floor. Our work shows that initially well-mixed and highly erosive submarine flows can produce extensive debris flow deposits beyond subtle slope breaks located far out in the deep ocean.","Univ Bristol, Dept Earth Sci, Bristol BS8 1RJ, Avon, England; Natl Oceanog Ctr Southampton, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England; Univ Aberdeen, Sch Geosci, Aberdeen AB24 3UE, Scotland; Univ Bremen, Dept Sedimentol & Paleoceanog, D-28334 Bremen, Germany","Talling, PJ (reprint author), Univ Bristol, Dept Earth Sci, Queens Rd, Bristol BS8 1RJ, Avon, England.",peter.talling@bris.ac.uk,,"Benetti, Sara/0000-0001-6286-9842",,,,30,124,136,4,48,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Nov,2007,450,7169,,,,,541,544,,10.1038/nature06313,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,234JW,WOS:000251158500045,18033295.0,No,,,11/20/17,l. a.,amy,na,na,na,na,na

If CO2 emissions continue to rise at current rates, upper-ocean pH will decrease to levels lower than have existed for tens of millions of years and, critically, at a rate of change 100 times greater than at any time over this period(3). Recent studies have shown effects of ocean acidification on a variety of marine life forms, in particular calcifying organisms(4-6). Consequences at the community to ecosystem level, in contrast, are largely unknown. Here we show that dissolved inorganic carbon consumption of a natural plankton community maintained in mesocosm enclosures at initial CO2 partial pressures of 350, 700 and 1,050 mu atm increases with rising CO2. The community consumed up to 39% more dissolved inorganic carbon at increased CO2 partial pressures compared to present levels, whereas nutrient uptake remained the same. The stoichiometry of carbon to nitrogen drawdown increased from 6.0 at low CO2 to 8.0 at high CO2, thus exceeding the Redfield carbon:nitrogen ratio of 6.6 in today's ocean(7). This excess carbon consumption was associated with higher loss of organic carbon from the upper layer of the stratified mesocosms. If applicable to the natural environment, the observed responses have implications for a variety of marine biological and biogeochemical processes, and underscore the importance of biologically driven feedbacks in the ocean to global change.","IFM, GEOMAR, Leibniz Inst Marine Sci, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; Univ Bergen, Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, N-5007 Bergen, Norway; Univ Bergen, Inst Geophys, N-5007 Bergen, Norway","Riebesell, U (reprint author), IFM, GEOMAR, Leibniz Inst Marine Sci, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.",uriebesell@ifm-geomar.de,"Bellerby, Richard/B-5277-2012; Oschlies, Andreas/F-9749-2012; Schulz, Kai /Q-5608-2017","Oschlies, Andreas/0000-0002-8295-4013; Schulz, Kai /0000-0002-8481-4639; Riebesell, Ulf/0000-0002-9442-452X",,,,38,392,412,16,278,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Nov,2007,450,7169,,,,,545,U10,,10.1038/nature06267,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,234JW,WOS:000251158500046,17994008.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,e.,zoellner,na,na,na,na,na

These fossils, typically only a few millimetres long, have often been charred in natural fires and preserve both three-dimensional morphology and cellular detail. Here we use phase-contrast-enhanced synchrotron-radiation X-ray tomographic microscopy to clarify the structure of small charcoalified gymnosperm seeds from the Early Cretaceous of Portugal and North America. The new information links these seeds to Gnetales ( including Erdtmanithecales, a putatively closely related fossil group(2)), and to Bennettitales-important extinct Mesozoic seed plants with cycad-like leaves and flower-like reproductive structures. The results suggest that the distinctive seed architecture of Gnetales, Erdtmanithecales and Bennettitales defines a clade containing these taxa. This has significant consequences for hypotheses of seed plant phylogeny by providing support for key elements of the controversial anthophyte hypothesis, which links angiosperms, Bennettitales and Gnetales.","Swedish Museum Nat Hist, Dept Palaeobot & Palaeozool, SE-10405 Stockholm, Sweden; Univ Chicago, Dept Geophys Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; Aarhus Univ, Dept Earth Sci, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark; Univ Bristol, Dept Earth Sci, Bristol BS8 1RJ, Avon, England; Univ Tubingen, Inst Geosci, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; Paul Scherrer Inst, Swiss Light Source, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland","Stampanoni, M (reprint author), Swedish Museum Nat Hist, Dept Palaeobot & Palaeozool, SE-10405 Stockholm, Sweden.",marco.stampanoni@psi.ch,"Donoghue, Philip/A-3873-2008; Pedersen, Kaj Raunsgaard/L-4105-2013; Stampanoni, Marco/J-4099-2013","Crane, Peter/0000-0003-4331-6948; Friis, Else Marie/0000-0001-7587-9687; Grimm, Guido/0000-0003-0674-3553; Bengtson, Stefan/0000-0003-0206-5791; Donoghue, Philip/0000-0003-3116-7463; Stampanoni, Marco/0000-0001-7486-6681",,,,30,115,128,2,30,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Nov,2007,450,7169,,,,,549,U11,,10.1038/nature06278,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,234JW,WOS:000251158500047,18033296.0,No,,,11/20/17,marco,stampanoni,male,0.99,2493,na,na

One goal of ageing research is to find drugs that would increase lifespan and vitality when given to an adult animal. To this end, we tested 88,000 chemicals for the ability to extend the lifespan of adult Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes. Here we report that a drug used as an antidepressant in humans increases C. elegans lifespan. In humans, this drug blocks neural signalling by the neurotransmitter serotonin. In C. elegans, the effect of the drug on lifespan is reduced or eradicated by mutations that affect serotonin synthesis, serotonin re-uptake at synapses, or either of two G-protein-coupled receptors: one that recognizes serotonin and the other that detects another neurotransmitter, octopamine. In vitro studies show that the drug acts as an antagonist at both receptors. Testing of the drug on dietary-restricted animals or animals with mutations that affect lifespan indicates that its effect on lifespan involves mechanisms associated with lifespan extension by dietary restriction. These studies indicate that lifespan can be extended by blocking certain types of neurotransmission implicated in food sensing in the adult animal, possibly leading to a state of perceived, although not real, starvation.","Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Div Basic Sci, Seattle, WA 98109 USA","Buck, LB (reprint author), Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Div Basic Sci, 1100 Fairview Ave N, Seattle, WA 98109 USA.",lbuck@fhcrc.org,,"Petrascheck, Michael/0000-0002-1010-145X",,,,29,128,155,2,44,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Nov,2007,450,7169,,,,,553,U12,,10.1038/nature05991,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,234JW,WOS:000251158500048,18033297.0,No,,,11/20/17,linda b.,buck,na,na,na,na,na

Humans must be able to assess the actions and intentions of the people around them, and make accurate decisions about who is friend and who is foe, who is an appropriate social partner and who is not. Indeed, all social animals benefit from the capacity to identify individual conspecifics that may help them, and to distinguish these individuals from others that may harm them. Human adults evaluate people rapidly and automatically on the basis of both behaviour and physical features(1-6), but the ontogenetic origins and development of this capacity are not well understood. Here we show that 6- and 10-month-old infants take into account an individual's actions towards others in evaluating that individual as appealing or aversive: infants prefer an individual who helps another to one who hinders another, prefer a helping individual to a neutral individual, and prefer a neutral individual to a hindering individual. These findings constitute evidence that preverbal infants assess individuals on the basis of their behaviour towards others. This capacity may serve as the foundation for moral thought and action, and its early developmental emergence supports the view that social evaluation is a biological adaptation.","Yale Univ, Dept Psychol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Hamlin, JK (reprint author), Yale Univ, Dept Psychol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",kiley.hamlin@yale.edu; karen.wynn@yale.edu,"Wynn, Karen/C-8067-2013",,,,,24,424,431,12,147,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Nov,2007,450,7169,,,,,557,U13,,10.1038/nature06288,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,234JW,WOS:000251158500049,18033298.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,paul,bloom,na,na,na,na,na

Globally, termites are an extremely successful group of wood-degrading organisms(1) and are therefore important both for their roles in carbon turnover in the environment and as potential sources of biochemical catalysts for efforts aimed at converting wood into biofuels. Only recently have data supported any direct role for the symbiotic bacteria in the gut of the termite in cellulose and xylan hydrolysis(2). Here we use a metagenomic analysis of the bacterial community resident in the hindgut paunch of a wood-feeding 'higher' Nasutitermes species ( which do not contain cellulose-fermenting protozoa) to show the presence of a large, diverse set of bacterial genes for cellulose and xylan hydrolysis. Many of these genes were expressed in vivo or had cellulase activity in vitro, and further analyses implicate spirochete and fibrobacter species in gut lignocellulose degradation. New insights into other important symbiotic functions including H-2 metabolism, CO2-reductive acetogenesis and N-2 fixation are also provided by this first system-wide gene analysis of a microbial community specialized towards plant lignocellulose degradation.

However, they also suppress natural immune responses to parasites(6) and viruses(7) as well as anti-tumour immunity induced by therapeutic vaccines(8). Although the manipulation of T-reg function is an important goal of immunotherapy, the molecules that mediate their suppressive activity remain largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that Epstein-Barr-virus-induced gene 3 (Ebi3, which encodes IL-27 beta) and interleukin-12 alpha (Il12a, which encodes IL-2 alpha/p35) are highly expressed by mouse Foxp3(+) ( forkhead box P3) Treg cells but not by resting or activated effector CD4(+) T (T-eff) cells, and that an Ebi3-IL-12 alpha heterodimer is constitutively secreted by T-reg but not T-eff cells. Both Ebi3 and Il12a messenger RNA are markedly upregulated in T-reg cells co-cultured with T-eff cells, thereby boosting Ebi3 and IL-12 alpha production in trans. T-reg-cell restriction of this cytokine occurs because Ebi3 is a downstream target of Foxp3, a transcription factor that is required for T-reg-cell development and function. Ebi3(-/-) and Il12a(-/-) T-reg cells have significantly reduced regulatory activity in vitro and fail to control homeostatic proliferation and to cure inflammatory bowel disease in vivo. Because these phenotypic characteristics are distinct from those of other IL-12 family members, this novel Ebi3-IL-12 alpha heterodimeric cytokine has been designated interleukin-35 ( IL-35). Ectopic expression of IL-35 confers regulatory activity on naive T cells, whereas recombinant IL-35 suppresses T-cell proliferation. Taken together, these data identify IL-35 as a novel inhibitory cytokine that may be specifically produced by T-reg cells and is required for maximal suppressive activity.","St Jude Childrens Hosp, Dept Immunol, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; St Jude Childrens Hosp, Anim Resources Ctr, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Sch Med, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; eBiosci, San Diego, CA 92121 USA","Vignali, DAA (reprint author), St Jude Childrens Hosp, Dept Immunol, 332 N Lauderdale St, Memphis, TN 38105 USA.",dario.vignali@stjude.org,,,,,,43,843,926,14,104,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Nov,2007,450,7169,,,,,566,U19,,10.1038/nature06306,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,234JW,WOS:000251158500051,18033300.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,dario a. a.,vignali,na,na,na,na,na

Like all other cargo, SNAREs need to be sorted into the forming vesicles by direct interaction with components of the vesicles' coats. Here we characterize the molecular details governing the sorting of a SNARE into clathrin-coated vesicles, namely the direct recognition of the three-helical bundle H-abc domain of the mouse SNARE Vti1b by the human clathrin adaptor epsinR (EPNR, also known as CLINT1). Structures of each domain and of their complex show that this interaction ( dissociation constant 22 mu M) is mediated by surface patches composed of approximately 15 residues each, the topographies of which are dependent on each domain's overall fold. Disruption of the interface with point mutations abolishes the interaction in vitro and causes Vti1b to become relocalized to late endosomes and lysosomes. This new class of highly specific, surface-surface interaction between the clathrin coat component and the cargo is distinct from the widely observed binding of short, linear cargo motifs by the assembly polypeptide (AP) complex and GGA adaptors(4) and is therefore not vulnerable to competition from standard motif-containing cargoes for incorporation into clathrin-coated vesicles. We propose that conceptually similar but mechanistically different interactions will direct the post-Golgi trafficking of many SNAREs.","Univ Cambridge, CIMR, Cambridge CB2 0XY, England; Univ Queensland, IMB, St Lucia, Qld 4075, Australia","Owen, DJ (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, CIMR, Wellcome Trust MRC Bldg,Hills Rd, Cambridge CB2 0XY, England.",msr12@mole.bio.cam.ac.uk; djo30@cam.ac.uk,"Collins, Brett/J-1563-2014","Collins, Brett/0000-0002-6070-3774",Wellcome Trust,,,38,71,72,0,15,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Nov,2007,450,7169,,,,,570,U21,,10.1038/nature06353,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,234JW,WOS:000251158500052,18033301.0,No,,,11/20/17,david j.,owen,na,na,na,na,na

Although the biological significance of qE is established(4-6), the molecular mechanisms involved are not(7-9). LHCII, the main light-harvesting complex, has an inbuilt capability to undergo transformation into a dissipative state by conformational change(10) and it was suggested that this provides a molecular basis for qE, but it is not known if such events occur in vivo or how energy is dissipated in this state. The transition into the dissipative state is associated with a twist in the configuration of the LHCII-bound carotenoid neoxanthin, identified using resonance Raman spectroscopy(11). Applying this technique to study isolated chloroplasts and whole leaves, we show here that the same change in neoxanthin configuration occurs in vivo, to an extent consistent with the magnitude of energy dissipation. Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy(12), performed on purified LHCII in the dissipative state, shows that energy is transferred from chlorophyll a to a low-lying carotenoid excited state, identified as one of the two luteins (lutein 1) in LHCII. Hence, it is experimentally demonstrated that a change in conformation of LHCII occurs in vivo, which opens a channel for energy dissipation by transfer to a bound carotenoid. We suggest that this is the principal mechanism of photoprotection.","Univ Sheffield, Dept Mol Biol & Biotechnol, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, London E1 4NS, England; Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Sci, Dept Phys & Astron, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; CEA, Inst Biol & Technol Saclay, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; CNRS, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Biophys Lab, NL-6700 ET Wageningen, Netherlands","Horton, P (reprint author), Univ Sheffield, Dept Mol Biol & Biotechnol, Western Bank, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",bruno.robert@cea.fr; p.horton@sheffield.ac.uk; rienk@few.vu.nl,"Horton, Peter/A-3958-2012; Robert, Bruno/D-1264-2012; pascal, andrew/B-6186-2014; van Stokkum, Ivo/E-7175-2015; van Amerongen, Herbert/J-9483-2016","Horton, Peter/0000-0002-6095-1460; Robert, Bruno/0000-0001-5999-4538; van Stokkum, Ivo/0000-0002-6143-2021; van Amerongen, Herbert/0000-0002-9783-2895",,,,30,470,478,21,215,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,22-Nov,2007,450,7169,,,,,575,U22,,10.1038/nature06262,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,234JW,WOS:000251158500053,18033302.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,rienk,van grondelle,male,1,1,eUDZt2EAAAAJ,35892

The intracellular pathogen Legionella pneumophila subverts Rab1 function to create a vacuole that supports bacterial replication by a mechanism that is not well understood. Here we describe L. pneumophila proteins that control Rab1 activity directly. We show that a region in the DrrA (defect in Rab1 recruitment A) protein required for recruitment of Rab1 to membranes functions as a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor displacement factor. A second region of the DrrA protein stimulated Rab1 activation by functioning as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor. The LepB protein was found to inactivate Rab1 by stimulating GTP hydrolysis, indicating that LepB has GTPase-activating protein activity that regulates removal of Rab proteins from membranes. Thus, L. pneumophila encodes proteins that regulate three distinct biochemical reactions critical for Rab GTPase membrane cycling to redirect Rab1 to the pathogen-occupied vacuole and to control Rab1 function.","Yale Univ, Sch Med, Sect Microbial Pathogenesis, Boyer Ctr Mol Med, New Haven, CT 06536 USA; UMASS Med Sch, Program Mol Med, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; UMASS Med Sch, Dept Mol Pharmacol & Biochem, Worcester, MA 01605 USA","Roy, CR (reprint author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, Sect Microbial Pathogenesis, Boyer Ctr Mol Med, 295 Congress Ave, New Haven, CT 06536 USA.",craig.roy@yale.edu,,"Roy, Craig/0000-0003-4490-440X","NIAID NIH HHS [R01 AI041699, R01 AI041699-13]",,,34,199,206,0,14,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Nov,2007,450,7168,,,,,365,U1,,10.1038/nature06336,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,231AM,WOS:000250918600043,17952054.0,No,,,11/20/17,craig r.,roy,na,na,na,na,na

Here we show that the voltage-sensor paddle, a motif composed of S3b and S4 helices, can drive channel opening with membrane depolarization when transplanted from an archaebacterial voltage-activated potassium channel (KvAP) or voltage-sensing domain proteins (Hv1 and Ci-VSP) into eukaryotic voltage-activated potassium channels. Tarantula toxins that partition into membranes can interact with these paddle motifs at the protein-lipid interface and similarly perturb voltage-sensor activation in both ion channels and proteins with a voltage-sensing domain. Our results show that paddle motifs are modular, that their functions are conserved in voltage sensors, and that they move in the relatively unconstrained environment of the lipid membrane. The widespread targeting of voltage-sensor paddles by toxins demonstrates that this modular structural motif is an important pharmacological target.","NINDS, Mol Physiol & Biophys Sect, Porter Neurosci Res Ctr, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; Gwangju Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Life Sci, Kwangju 500712, South Korea","Swartz, KJ (reprint author), NINDS, Mol Physiol & Biophys Sect, Porter Neurosci Res Ctr, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",swartzk@ninds.nih.gov,,,Intramural NIH HHS [ZIA NS002945-13],,,49,148,150,3,20,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Nov,2007,450,7168,,,,,370,U2,,10.1038/nature06266,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,231AM,WOS:000250918600044,18004375.0,No,,,11/20/17,kenton j.,swartz,na,na,na,na,na

Alternatively, the progenitor might have arisen from the merger of two massive stars(7).

Here we report that the brightest supernovae in the modern Universe arise from collisions between shells of matter ejected by massive stars that undergo an interior instability arising from the production of electron - positron pairs(2). This `pair instability' leads to explosive burning that is insufficient to unbind the star, but ejects many solar masses of the envelope. After the first explosion, the remaining core contracts and searches for a stable burning state. When the next explosion occurs, several solar masses of material are again ejected, which collide with the earlier ejecta. This collision can radiate 10(50) erg of light, about a factor of ten more than an ordinary supernova.

A key example is the measurement of optical phase, used in length metrology and many other applications. Advances in precision measurement have consistently led to important scientific discoveries. At the fundamental level, measurement precision is limited by the number N of quantum resources (such as photons) that are used. Standard measurement schemes, using each resource independently, lead to a phase uncertainty that scales as 1/root N-known as the standard quantum limit. However, it has long been conjectured(1,2) that it should be possible to achieve a precision limited only by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, dramatically improving the scaling to 1/N (ref. 3). It is commonly thought that achieving this improvement requires the use of exotic quantum entangled states, such as the NOON state(4,5). These states are extremely difficult to generate. Measurement schemes with counted photons or ions have been performed with N <= 6 (refs 6 - 15), but few have surpassed the standard quantum limit(12,14) and none have shown Heisenberg-limited scaling. Here we demonstrate experimentally a Heisenberg-limited phase estimation procedure. We replace entangled input states with multiple applications of the phase shift on unentangled single-photon states. We generalize Kitaev's phase estimation algorithm(16) using adaptive measurement theory(17-20) to achieve a standard deviation scaling at the Heisenberg limit. For the largest number of resources used ( N=378), we estimate an unknown phase with a variance more than 10 dB below the standard quantum limit; achieving this variance would require more than 4,000 resources using standard interferometry.

However, recent research(2-6) has examined the possibility of modifying the way the light travels by taking a normal transparent dielectric and inserting tiny metallic inclusions of various shapes and arrangements. As light passes through these structures, oscillating electric currents are set up that generate electromagnetic field moments; these can lead to dramatic effects on the light propagation, such as negative refraction. Possible applications include lenses that break traditional diffraction limits(3,4) and `invisibility cloaks' (refs 5, 6). Significantly less research has focused on the potential of such structures for slowing, trapping and releasing light signals. Here we demonstrate theoretically that an axially varying heterostructure with a metamaterial core of negative refractive index can be used to efficiently and coherently bring light to a complete standstill. In contrast to previous approaches for decelerating and storing light(7-13), the present scheme simultaneously allows for high in-coupling efficiencies and broadband, room-temperature operation. Surprisingly, our analysis reveals a critical point at which the effective thickness of the waveguide is reduced to zero, preventing the light wave from propagating further. At this point, the light ray is permanently trapped, its trajectory forming a double light-cone that we call an `optical clepsydra'. Each frequency component of the wave packet is stopped at a different guide thickness, leading to the spatial separation of its spectrum and the formation of a `trapped rainbow'. Our results bridge the gap between two important contemporary realms of science-metamaterials and slow light.

It is of interest for ultimate control over light quanta(1), as well as for potential applications such as efficient photon collection(2), single-photon switching(3) and transistors(4), and long-range optical coupling of quantum bits(5,6). Recently, substantial advances have been made towards these goals, based on modifying photon fields around an emitter using high-finesse optical cavities(2,3,5-8). Here we demonstrate a cavity-free, broadband approach for engineering photon-emitter interactions(4,9) via subwavelength confinement of optical fields near metallic nanostructures(10-13). When a single CdSe quantum dot is optically excited in close proximity to a silver nanowire, emission from the quantum dot couples directly to guided surface plasmons in the nanowire, causing the wire's ends to light up. Non-classical photon correlations between the emission from the quantum dot and the ends of the nanowire demonstrate that the latter stems from the generation of single, quantized plasmons. Results from a large number of devices show that efficient coupling is accompanied by more than 2.5-fold enhancement of the quantum dot spontaneous emission, in good agreement with theoretical predictions.","Harvard Univ, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Biol Chem, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Texas A&M Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; RAS, PN Lebedev Phys Inst, Moscow 119991, Russia","Park, H (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",Hongkun_Park@harvard.edu,"Akimov, Alexey/J-6385-2015; Zibrov, Alexander/G-7419-2014","Akimov, Alexey/0000-0002-4167-5085; ",,,,31,868,874,21,339,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Nov,2007,450,7168,,,,,402,406,,10.1038/nature06230,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,231AM,WOS:000250918600051,18004381.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,m. d.,lukin,na,na,na,na,na

The efficiency of organic carbon deposition in sedimentary basins is however limited by the organic carbon load capacity of the sediments and organic carbon oxidation in continental margins. At the global scale, previous studies have suggested that about 70 per cent of riverine organic carbon is returned to the atmosphere, such as in the Amazon basin(2-4). Here we present a comprehensive organic carbon budget for the Himalayan erosional system, including source rocks, river sediments and marine sediments buried in the Bengal fan. We show that organic carbon export is controlled by sediment properties, and that oxidative loss is negligible during transport and deposition to the ocean. Our results indicate that 70 to 85 per cent of the organic carbon is recent organic matter captured during transport, which serves as a net sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide. The amount of organic carbon deposited in the Bengal basin represents about 10 to 20 per cent of the total terrestrial organic carbon buried in oceanic sediments. High erosion rates in the Himalayas generate high sedimentation rates and low oxygen availability in the Bay of Bengal that sustain the observed extreme organic carbon burial efficiency. Active orogenic systems generate enhanced physical erosion and the resulting organic carbon burial buffers atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, thereby exerting a negative feedback on climate over geological timescales.","CNRS, ENS Paris, Geol Lab, INSU, F-75005 Paris 5, France; Nancy Univ, CNRS, G2R INSU, F-54506 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France; Fed Inst Geosci & Nat Resources, D-30655 Hannover, Germany; Nancy Univ, CRPG, CNRS, INSU, F-54501 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France","Galy, V (reprint author), Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, 360 Woods Hole Rd, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.",vgaly@whoi.edu,"Beyssac, Olivier/A-8647-2008; France-Lanord, Christian/F-8848-2010; Beyssac, Olivier/F-6811-2012; galy, valier/I-6185-2012; IMPMC, Geobio/F-8819-2016","France-Lanord, Christian/0000-0002-4873-5546",,,,35,205,211,2,94,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Nov,2007,450,7168,,,,,407,U6,,10.1038/nature06273,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,231AM,WOS:000250918600052,18004382.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,fabien,palhol,male,1,237,na,na

Here we examine the social evolution of QS experimentally in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and show that although QS can provide a benefit at the group level, exploitative individuals can avoid the cost of producing the QS signal or of performing the cooperative behaviour that is coordinated by QS, and can therefore spread. We also show that a solution to the problem of exploitation is kin selection, if interacting bacterial cells tend to be close relatives.

Previous studies have characterized the expression of both SMRT ( also known as NCoR2, nuclear receptor co-repressor 2) and NCoR in a variety of developmental systems(8); however, the specific role of the SMRT corepressor in neurogenesis is still to be determined. Here we report a critical role for SMRT in forebrain development and in maintenance of the neural stem cell state. Analysis of a series of markers in SMRT-gene-deleted mice revealed the functional requirement of SMRT in the actions of both retinoic-acid-dependent and Notch-dependent forebrain development. In isolated cortical progenitor cells, SMRT was critical for preventing retinoic-acid-receptor- dependent induction of differentiation along a neuronal pathway in the absence of any ligand. Our data reveal that SMRT represses expression of the jumonji-domain containing gene JMJD3, a direct retinoic-acid-receptor target that functions as a histone H3 trimethyl K27 demethylase and which is capable of activating specific components of the neurogenic program.","Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Dept Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Dept Cellular & Mol Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Karolinska Inst, Dept Neurosci, Ctr Excellence Dev Biol, SE-17177 Stockholm, Sweden","Jepsen, K (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",kjepsen@ucsd.edu,,"Hermanson, Ola/0000-0001-9320-7921",,,,35,250,261,3,24,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Nov,2007,450,7168,,,,,415,U8,,10.1038/nature06270,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,231AM,WOS:000250918600054,17928865.0,No,,,11/20/17,michael g.,rosenfeld,na,na,na,na,na

Hypocretin(3) (Hcrt, also known as orexin(4))-producing neurons in the lateral hypothalamus(5) are important for arousal stability(2), and loss of Hcrt function has been linked to narcolepsy(6-9). However, it is unknown whether electrical activity arising from Hcrt neurons is sufficient to drive awakening from sleep states or is simply correlated with it. Here we directly probed the impact of Hcrt neuron activity on sleep state transitions with in vivo neural photostimulation(10-18), genetically targeting channelrhodopsin-2 to Hcrt cells and using an optical fibre to deliver light deep in the brain, directly into the lateral hypothalamus, of freely moving mice. We found that direct, selective, optogenetic photostimulation of Hcrt neurons increased the probability of transition to wakefulness from either slow wave sleep or rapid eye movement sleep. Notably, photostimulation using 5-30 Hz light pulse trains reduced latency to wakefulness, whereas 1 Hz trains did not.

In this way, cortical representations of the sensory environment can incorporate new information about the world, depending on the relevance or value of particular stimuli(1,6,9). Neuromodulation is required for cortical plasticity, but it is uncertain how subcortical neuromodulatory systems, such as the cholinergic nucleus basalis, interact with and refine cortical circuits(13-24). Here we determine the dynamics of synaptic receptive field plasticity in the adult primary auditory cortex ( also known as AI) using in vivo whole-cell recording. Pairing sensory stimulation with nucleus basalis activation shifted the preferred stimuli of cortical neurons by inducing a rapid reduction of synaptic inhibition within seconds, which was followed by a large increase in excitation, both specific to the paired stimulus. Although nucleus basalis was stimulated only for a few minutes, reorganization of synaptic tuning curves progressed for hours thereafter: inhibition slowly increased in an activity-dependent manner to rebalance the persistent enhancement of excitation, leading to a retuned receptive field with new preference for the paired stimulus. This restricted period of disinhibition may be a fundamental mechanism for receptive field plasticity, and could serve as a memory trace(9,25) for stimuli or episodes that have acquired new behavioural significance.","Univ Calif San Francisco, Coleman Mem Lab, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, WM Keck Fdn Ctr Integrat Neurosci, Dept Otolaryngol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Froemke, RC (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Coleman Mem Lab, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",rfroemke@phy.ucsf.edu,,"Schreiner, Christoph/0000-0002-4571-4328; Froemke, Robert/0000-0002-1230-6811","NIDCD NIH HHS [R01 DC002260, R01 DC002260-12]",,,30,265,265,0,25,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Nov,2007,450,7168,,,,,425,429,,10.1038/nature06289,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,231AM,WOS:000250918600056,18004384.0,No,,,11/20/17,christoph e.,schreiner,na,na,na,na,na

ELMO/ Dock(180)/Rac proteins are a conserved signalling module for promoting the internalization of apoptotic cell corpses(4,5); ELMO and Dock180 function together as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the small GTPase Rac, and thereby regulate the phagocyte actin cytoskeleton during engulfment(4 -6). However, the receptor(s) upstream of the ELMO/ Dock180/ Rac module are still unknown. Here we identify brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1 (BAI1) as a receptor upstream of ELMO and as a receptor that can bind phosphatidylserine on apoptotic cells. BAI1 is a seven-transmembrane protein belonging to the adhesion-type G-protein-coupled receptor family, with an extended extracellular region(7-9) and no known ligands. We show that BAI1 functions as an engulfment receptor in both the recognition and subsequent internalization of apoptotic cells. Through multiple lines of investigation, we identify phosphatidylserine, a key `eat-me' signal exposed on apoptotic cells(10-13), as a ligand for BAI1. The thrombospondin type 1 repeats within the extracellular region of BAI1 mediate direct binding to phosphatidylserine. As with intracellular signalling, BAI1 forms a trimeric complex with ELMO and Dock180, and functional studies suggest that BAI1 cooperates with ELMO/ Dock180/Rac to promote maximal engulfment of apoptotic cells. Last, decreased BAI1 expression or interference with BAI1 function inhibits the engulfment of apoptotic targets ex vivo and in vivo. Thus, BAI1 is a phosphatidylserine recognition receptor that can directly recruit a Rac-GEF complex to mediate the uptake of apoptotic cells.","Univ Virginia, Carter Immunol Ctr, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; Univ Virginia, Dept Cell Biol, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; Univ Virginia, Dept Microbiol, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; Univ Virginia, Div Cardiovasc, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; Univ Virginia, Dept Pathol, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA","Ravichandran, KS (reprint author), Univ Virginia, Carter Immunol Ctr, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA.",ravi@virginia.edu,,"Elliott, Michael/0000-0002-0642-482X",NIAID NIH HHS [T32 AI055432],,,25,386,399,2,15,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Nov,2007,450,7168,,,,,430,U10,,10.1038/nature06329,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,231AM,WOS:000250918600057,17960134.0,No,,,11/20/17,kodi s.,ravichandran,na,na,na,na,na

In definitive erythropoiesis, nuclei are expelled from erythroid precursor cells and are engulfed by macrophages. Phosphatidylserine is exposed on the surface of apoptotic cells(3) and on the nuclei expelled from erythroid precursor cells(4); it works as an 'eat me' signal for phagocytes(5,6). Phosphatidylserine is also expressed on the surface of exosomes involved in intercellular signalling(7). Here we established a library of hamster monoclonal antibodies against mouse peritoneal macrophages, and found an antibody that strongly inhibited the phosphatidylserine-dependent engulfment of apoptotic cells. The antigen recognized by the antibody was identified by expression cloning as a type I transmembrane protein called Tim4 (T-cell immunoglobulin- and mucin-domain-containing molecule; also known as Timd4)(8). Tim4 was expressed in Mac1(+) cells in various mouse tissues, including spleen, lymph nodes and fetal liver. Tim4 bound apoptotic cells by recognizing phosphatidylserine via its immunoglobulin domain. The expression of Tim4 in fibroblasts enhanced their ability to engulf apoptotic cells. When the anti-Tim4 monoclonal antibody was administered into mice, the engulfment of apoptotic cells by thymic macrophages was significantly blocked, and the mice developed autoantibodies. Among the other Tim family members, Tim1, but neither Tim2 nor Tim3, specifically bound phosphatidylserine. Tim1- or Tim4-expressing Ba/F3 B cells were bound by exosomes via phosphatidylserine, and exosomes stimulated the interaction between Tim1 and Tim4. These results indicate that Tim4 and Tim1 are phosphatidylserine receptors for the engulfment of apoptotic cells, and may also be involved in intercellular signalling in which exosomes are involved.","Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Med Chem, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; Osaka Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Osaka 5650871, Japan; Osaka Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol & Neurosci, Osaka 5650871, Japan; Univ Tokyo, Inst Med Sci, Div Cellular Therapy, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088639, Japan; Japan Sci & Technol Corp, Solut Oriented Res Sci & Technol, Kyoto 6068501, Japan","Nagata, S (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Med Chem, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.",snagata@mfour.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Koike, Masato/F-9584-2010","Koike, Masato/0000-0002-3174-5684",,,,30,508,529,4,43,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Nov,2007,450,7168,,,,,435,439,,10.1038/nature06307,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,231AM,WOS:000250918600058,17960135.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,shigekazu,nagata,na,na,na,na,na

As such, it is an instructive source to understand the molecular basis for changes in chromatin structure that correlate with transcriptional status. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and suppressor of variegation 3-9 homologue 1 ( SUV39H1) are amongst the enzymes responsible for chromatin modulations associated with facultative heterochromatin formation. SUV39H1 is the principal enzyme responsible for the accumulation of histone H3 containing a trimethyl group at its lysine 9 position (H3K9me3) in regions of heterochromatin(2). SIRT1 is an NAD+-dependent deacetylase that targets histone H4 at lysine 16 (refs 3 and 4), and through an unknown mechanism facilitates increased levels of H3K9me3 (ref. 3). Here we show that the mammalian histone methyltransferase SUV39H1 is itself targeted by the histone deacetylase SIRT1 and that SUV39H1 activity is regulated by acetylation at lysine residue 266 in its catalytic SET domain. SIRT1 interacts directly with, recruits and deacetylates SUV39H1, and these activities independently contribute to elevated levels of SUV39H1 activity resulting in increased levels of the H3K9me3 modification. Loss of SIRT1 greatly affects SUV39H1-dependent H3K9me3 and impairs localization of heterochromatin protein 1. These findings demonstrate a functional link between the heterochromatin-related histone methyltransferase SUV39H1 and the histone deacetylase SIRT1.","Univ Med & Dent New Jersey, Robert Wood Johnson Med Sch, Dept Biochem, Howard Hughes Med Inst,Div Nucl Acids Enzymol, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; Rutgers State Univ, Inst Human Genet, Dept Genet, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; NYU, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, New York, NY 10016 USA; Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Program Mol Biol, New York, NY 10021 USA","Reinberg, D (reprint author), Univ Med & Dent New Jersey, Robert Wood Johnson Med Sch, Dept Biochem, Howard Hughes Med Inst,Div Nucl Acids Enzymol, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.",reinbdO1@med.nyu.edu,"Vaquero, Alejandro/I-9845-2014","Vaquero, Alejandro/0000-0002-8735-4156; Tempst, Paul/0000-0002-6680-3987",,,,17,198,214,0,16,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Nov,2007,450,7168,,,,,440,444,,10.1038/nature06268,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,231AM,WOS:000250918600059,18004385.0,No,,,11/20/17,danny,reinberg,male,0.95,1633,nFuH4MMAAAAJ,59660

Pol II can use a homopolymeric RNA template(1), can extend RNA by several nucleotides in the absence of DNA(2), and has been implicated in the replication of the RNA genomes of hepatitis delta virus (HDV)(3,4) and plant viroids(5). Here we show the intrinsic RdRP activity of Pol II with only pure polymerase, an RNA template-product scaffold and nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs). Crystallography reveals the template-product duplex in the site occupied by the DNA-RNA hybrid during transcription. RdRP activity resides at the active site used during transcription, but it is slower and less processive than DNA-dependent activity. RdRP activity is also obtained with part of the HDV antigenome. The complex of transcription factor IIS (TFIIS) with Pol II can cleave one HDV strand, create a reactive stem-loop in the hybrid site, and extend the new RNA 3' end. Short RNA stem-loops with a 5' extension suffice for activity, but their growth to a critical length apparently impairs processivity. The RdRP activity of Pol II provides a missing link in molecular evolution, because it suggests that Pol II evolved from an ancient replicase that duplicated RNA genomes.","Univ Munich, Gene Ctr Munich, D-81377 Munich, Germany; Univ Munich, Ctr Integrated Prot Sci, Dept Chem & Biochem, D-81377 Munich, Germany","Cramer, P (reprint author), Univ Munich, Gene Ctr Munich, Feodor Lynen Str 25, D-81377 Munich, Germany.",cramer@LMB.uni-muenchen.de,,,,,,24,76,77,0,2,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,15-Nov,2007,450,7168,,,,,445,449,,10.1038/nature06290,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,231AM,WOS:000250918600060,18004386.0,No,,,11/20/17,patrick,cramer,male,1,2877,NKjlhVQAAAAJ,14443

Scientists have discovered that conserved mechanisms control the development of all organisms. Drosophila has proved to be a particularly powerful model system with which to identify the signalling pathways that organize tissue patterns. More recently, much has been learned about the control of tissue growth, tissue shape and their coordination at the cellular and tissue levels. New models integrate how specific signals and mechanical forces shape tissues and may also control their size.","Univ Aix Marseille 2, Inst Biol Dev Marseille Luminy, F-13288 Marseille 09, France; CNRS, UMR6216, F-13288 Marseille, France","Lecuit, T (reprint author), Univ Aix Marseille 2, Inst Biol Dev Marseille Luminy, Campus Luminy Case 907, F-13288 Marseille 09, France.",lecuit@ibdml.univ-mrs.fr,,,,,,49,113,115,2,24,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Nov,2007,450,7167,,,,,189,192,,10.1038/nature06304,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,228RC,WOS:000250746200039,17994084.0,No,,,11/20/17,loic,le goff,male,0.99,190,na,na

The genomes of 12 Drosophila species, ten of which are presented here for the first time (sechellia, simulans, yakuba, erecta, ananassae, persimilis, willistoni, mojavensis, virilis and grimshawi), illustrate how rates and patterns of sequence divergence across taxa can illuminate evolutionary processes on a genomic scale. These genome sequences augment the formidable genetic tools that have made Drosophila melanogaster a pre-eminent model for animal genetics, and will further catalyse fundamental research on mechanisms of development, cell biology, genetics, disease, neurobiology, behaviour, physiology and evolution. Despite remarkable similarities among these Drosophila species, we identified many putatively non-neutral changes in protein-coding genes, non-coding RNA genes, and cis-regulatory regions. These may prove to underlie differences in the ecology and behaviour of these diverse species.","Cornell Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Div Life Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA;

Sex is the most important difference between individuals in a species and has long been posited to be rapidly evolving. Indeed, in the Drosophila genus, traits such as sperm length, genitalia, and gonad size are the most obvious differences between species(6). Comparative analysis of sex-biased expression should deepen our understanding of the relationship between genome content and deployment during evolution. Using existing(7,8) and newly assembled genomes(9), we designed species-specific microarrays to examine sex-biased expression of orthologues and species-restricted genes in D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D. yakuba, D. ananassae, D. pseudoobscura, D. virilis and D. mojavensis. We show that averaged sex-biased expression changes accumulate monotonically over time within the genus. However, different genes contribute to expression variance within species groups compared to between groups. We observed greater turnover of species-restricted genes with male-biased expression, indicating that gene formation and extinction may play a significant part in species differences. Genes with male-biased expression also show the greatest expression and DNA sequence divergence. This higher divergence and turnover of genes with male-biased expression may be due to high transcription rates in the male germline, greater functional pleiotropy of genes expressed in females, and/or sexual competition.","NIDDKD, Cellular & Dev Biol Lab, NIH, US Dept HHS, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; Arizona State Univ, Ctr Evolutionary Funct Genom, Biodesign Inst, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA","Zhang, Y (reprint author), NIDDKD, Cellular & Dev Biol Lab, NIH, US Dept HHS, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",yuzhang@mail.nih.gov; oliver@helix.nih.gov,"Kumar, Sudhir/F-1411-2011","Kumar, Sudhir/0000-0002-9918-8212","Intramural NIH HHS [Z01 DK015600-12]; NHGRI NIH HHS [R01 HG002516, R01 HG002516-04A1]",,,39,168,169,2,38,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Nov,2007,450,7167,,,,,233,U2,,10.1038/nature06323,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,228RC,WOS:000250746200044,17994089.0,No,,,11/20/17,brian,oliver,male,1,4600,gg3UPR8AAAAJ,9109

For example, genes with male-biased expression are under-represented on the X chromosome of D. melanogaster(2), but are randomly distributed in the genome of Anopheles gambiae(3). In direct global profiling experiments using species-specific microarrays, we find a nearly identical paucity of genes with male-biased expression on D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D. yakuba, D. ananassae, D. virilis and D. mojavensis X chromosomes. We observe the same under-representation on the neo-X of D. pseudoobscura. It has been suggested that precocious meiotic silencing of the X chromosome accounts for reduced X chromosome male-biased expression in nematodes(4), mammals(5) and Drosophila(6). We show that X chromosome genes with male-biased expression are under-represented in somatic cells and in mitotic male germ cells. These data are incompatible with simple X chromosome inactivation models. Using expression profiling and comparative sequence analysis, we show that selective gene extinction on the X chromosome, creation of new genes on autosomes and changed genomic location of existing genes contribute to the unusual X chromosome gene content.","NIDDKD, Cellular & Dev Biol Lab, NIH, US Dept HHS, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Sturgill, D (reprint author), NIDDKD, Cellular & Dev Biol Lab, NIH, US Dept HHS, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",davidsturgill@niddk.nih.gov; oliver@helix.nih.gov,,,Intramural NIH HHS [Z01 DK015600-12],,,25,146,146,0,20,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Nov,2007,450,7167,,,,,238,U3,,10.1038/nature06330,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,228RC,WOS:000250746200045,17994090.0,No,,,11/20/17,brian,oliver,male,1,4600,gg3UPR8AAAAJ,9109

Here we describe a new approach to refining protein structure models that focuses sampling in regions most likely to contain errors while allowing the whole structure to relax in a physically realistic all-atom force field. In applications to models produced using nuclear magnetic resonance data and to comparative models based on distant structural homologues, the method can significantly improve the accuracy of the structures in terms of both the backbone conformations and the placement of core side chains. Furthermore, the resulting models satisfy a particularly stringent test: they provide significantly better solutions to the X-ray crystallographic phase problem in molecular replacement trials. Finally, we show that all-atom refinement can produce de novo protein structure predictions that reach the high accuracy required for molecular replacement without any experimental phase information and in the absence of templates suitable for molecular replacement from the Protein Data Bank. These results suggest that the combination of high-resolution structure prediction with state-of-the-art phasing tools may be unexpectedly powerful in phasing crystallographic data for which molecular replacement is hindered by the absence of sufficiently accurate previous models.","Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Inst Med Res, Dept Haematol, Cambridge CB2 0XY, England","Baker, D (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",dabaker@u.washington.edu,"Read, Randy/L-1418-2013; Baker, David/K-8941-2012","Read, Randy/0000-0001-8273-0047; Baker, David/0000-0001-7896-6217; Das, Rhiju/0000-0001-7497-0972","Wellcome Trust [, 050211]",,,50,196,202,4,34,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,8-Nov,2007,450,7167,,,,,259,264,,10.1038/nature06249,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,228RC,WOS:000250746200052,17934447.0,No,,,11/20/17,david,baker,male,1,12593,UKqIqRsAAAAJ,66604

Saturn, despite an apparently axisymmetric magnetic field(6), emits kilometre-wavelength (radio) photons from auroral sources. This emission is modulated at a period initially identified as 10 h 39 min 24 +/- 7 s, and this has been adopted as Saturn's rotation period(3). Subsequent observations(7,8), however, revealed that this period varies by +/-6 min on a timescale of several months to years. Here we report that the kilometric radiation period varies systematically by +/-1% with a characteristic timescale of 20-30 days. Here we show that these fluctuations are correlated with solar wind speed at Saturn, meaning that Saturn's radio clock is controlled, at least in part, by conditions external to the planet's magnetosphere. No correlation is found with the solar wind density, dynamic pressure or magnetic field; the solar wind speed therefore has a special function. We also show that the long-term fluctuations are simply an average of the short-term ones, and therefore the long-term variations are probably also driven by changes in the solar wind.","Univ Paris 06, CNRS, Observ Paris, Lab Etud Spatiales & Instruemntat Astrophys, F-92190 Meudon, France; Austrian Acad Sci, Space Res Inst, A-8042 Graz, Austria","Zarka, P (reprint author), Univ Paris 06, CNRS, Observ Paris, Lab Etud Spatiales & Instruemntat Astrophys, F-92190 Meudon, France.",philippe.zarka@obspm.fr,,"Cecconi, Baptiste/0000-0001-7915-5571",,,,30,52,52,0,2,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Nov,2007,450,7167,,,,,265,267,,10.1038/nature06237,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,228RC,WOS:000250746200053,17994092.0,No,,,11/20/17,helmut o.,rucker,na,na,na,na,na

By using high-quality resonators, a strong coupling regime can be reached experimentally in which atoms coherently exchange a photon with a single light-field mode many times before dissipation sets in. This has led to fundamental studies with both microwave(2,3) and optical resonators(4). To meet the challenges posed by quantum state engineering(5) and quantum information processing, recent experiments have focused on laser cooling and trapping of atoms inside an optical cavity(6-8). However, the tremendous degree of control over atomic gases achieved with Bose-Einstein condensation(9) has so far not been used for cavity QED. Here we achieve the strong coupling of a Bose-Einstein condensate to the quantized field of an ultrahigh-finesse optical cavity and present a measurement of its eigenenergy spectrum. This is a conceptually new regime of cavity QED, in which all atoms occupy a single mode of a matter-wave field and couple identically to the light field, sharing a single excitation. This opens possibilities ranging from quantum communication(10-12) to a wealth of new phenomena that can be expected in the many-body physics of quantum gases with cavity-mediated interactions(13,14).","ETH, Inst Quantum Elect, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; Inst Opt, Lab Charles Fabry, F-91127 Palaiseau, France; Univ Cambridge, Cavendish Lab, Cambridge CB3 0HE, England","Esslinger, T (reprint author), ETH, Inst Quantum Elect, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",esslinger@phys.ethz.ch,"Kohl, Michael/C-6114-2009; Ritter, Stephan/F-1579-2010; Donner, Tobias/A-2845-2011; Esslinger, Tilman/M-9022-2016","Kohl, Michael/0000-0003-4055-713X; Ritter, Stephan/0000-0001-9002-7407; Donner, Tobias/0000-0001-7016-587X; Esslinger, Tilman/0000-0002-8333-107X",,,,30,339,345,3,49,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Nov,2007,450,7167,,,,,268,U8,,10.1038/nature06120,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,228RC,WOS:000250746200054,17994093.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,tilman,esslinger,male,1,4,na,na

For single atoms, this 'strong coupling regime' of cavity quantum electrodynamics(1,2) has been the subject of many experimental advances. Efforts have been made to control the coupling rate by trapping(3,4) the atom and cooling(5,6) it towards the motional ground state; the latter has been achieved in one dimension so far(5). For systems of many atoms, the three-dimensional ground state of motion is routinely achieved(7) in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). Although experiments combining BECs and optical cavities have been reported recently(8,9), coupling BECs to cavities that are in the strong-coupling regime for single atoms has remained an elusive goal. Here we report such an experiment, made possible by combining a fibre-based cavity(10) with atom-chip technology(11). This enables single-atom cavity quantum electrodynamics experiments with a simplified set-up and realizes the situation of many atoms in a cavity, each of which is identically and strongly coupled to the cavity mode(12). Moreover, the BEC can be positioned deterministically anywhere within the cavity and localized entirely within a single antinode of the standing-wave cavity field; we demonstrate that this gives rise to a controlled, tunable coupling rate. We study the heating rate caused by a cavity transmission measurement as a function of the coupling rate and find no measurable heating for strongly coupled BECs. The spectrum of the coupled atoms-cavity system, which we map out over a wide range of atom numbers and cavity-atom detunings, shows vacuum Rabi splittings exceeding 20 gigahertz, as well as an unpredicted additional splitting, which we attribute to the atomic hyperfine structure. We anticipate that the system will be suitable as a light-matter quantum interface for quantum information(13).","Univ Paris 06, CNRS, ENS, Lab Kastler Brossel, F-75005 Paris, France; LMU, Max Planck Inst Quantenopt, D-80799 Munich, Germany","Reichel, J (reprint author), Univ Paris 06, CNRS, ENS, Lab Kastler Brossel, 24 Rue Lhomond, F-75005 Paris, France.",jakob.reichel@ens.fr,"Hunger, David/A-7673-2012","Hunger, David/0000-0001-6156-6145; Reichel, Jakob/0000-0003-3420-4178",,,,34,434,440,4,53,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Nov,2007,450,7167,,,,,272,U9,,10.1038/nature06331,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,228RC,WOS:000250746200055,17994094.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,jakob,reichel,male,0.99,148,EOrqDVAAAAAJ,8184

Little is known, however, about the factors controlling the stability of soil organic carbon stocks(2-4) and the response of the soil carbon pool to climate change remains uncertain(5,6). We investigated the stability of carbon in deep soil layers in one soil profile by combining physical and chemical characterization of organic carbon, soil incubations and radiocarbon dating. Here we show that the supply of fresh plant-derived carbon to the subsoil (0.6-0.8 m depth) stimulated the microbial mineralization of 2,567 +/- 226-year-old carbon. Our results support the previously suggested idea(7) that in the absence of fresh organic carbon, an essential source of energy for soil microbes, the stability of organic carbon in deep soil layers is maintained. We propose that a lack of supply of fresh carbon may prevent the decomposition of the organic carbon pool in deep soil layers in response to future changes in temperature. Any change in land use and agricultural practice that increases the distribution of fresh carbon along the soil profile(1,8,9) could however stimulate the loss of ancient buried carbon.","INRA, UR Agron 874, F-63100 Clermont Ferrand, France; IRD, UMR 137, F-93143 Bondy, France; CNRS INRA ENS Paris 6, UMR 7618, BIOEMCO, F-78820 Thiverval Grignon, France; INRA, UR Agron 1158, F-02007 Laon, France","Fontaine, S (reprint author), INRA, UR Agron 874, 234 Ave Brezet, F-63100 Clermont Ferrand, France.",fontaine@clermont.inra.fr,"barot, sebastien/A-8447-2012; Rumpel, Cornelia/A-2001-2015","barot, sebastien/0000-0002-5910-538X; ",,,,29,714,786,55,675,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Nov,2007,450,7167,,,,,277,U10,,10.1038/nature06275,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,228RC,WOS:000250746200056,17994095.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,cornelia,rumpel,female,1,83,-ZwMv-UAAAAJ,9323

Ozone is also of fundamental importance for the chemistry of the lowermost part of the atmosphere, the troposphere(1-8). At ground level, ozone is an important by-product of anthropogenic pollution(7), damaging forests and crops(5,6), and negatively affecting human health(9). Ozone is critical to the chemical and thermal balance of the troposphere(10) because, via the formation of hydroxyl radicals, it controls the capacity of tropospheric air to oxidize and remove other pollutants(1). Moreover, ozone is an important greenhouse gas, particularly in the upper troposphere(1). Although photochemistry in the lower troposphere is the major source of tropospheric ozone(2,7,11), the stratosphere-troposphere transport of ozone(12-19) is important to the overall climatology, budget and long-term trends of tropospheric ozone(3,4,8,12). Stratospheric intrusion events, however, are still poorly understood. Here we introduce the use of modern windprofiler radars(20-22) to assist in such transport investigations. By hourly monitoring the radar-derived tropopause height(23-25) in combination with a series of frequent ozonesonde balloon launches, we find numerous intrusions of ozone from the stratosphere into the troposphere in southeastern Canada. On some occasions, ozone is dispersed at altitudes of two to four kilometres, but on other occasions it reaches the ground, where it can dominate the ozone density variability. We observe rapid changes in radar tropopause height immediately preceding these intrusion events. Such changes therefore serve as a valuable diagnostic for the occurrence of ozone intrusion events. Our studies emphasize the impact that stratospheric ozone can have on tropospheric ozone, and show that windprofiler data can be used to infer the possibility of ozone intrusions, as well as better represent tropopause motions in association with stratosphere-troposphere transport.","Univ Western Ontario, Dept Phys & Astron, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada; Environm Canada, Toronto, ON M3H 5T4, Canada; Univ Toronto, Dept Phys, Toronto, ON M5S 1A7, Canada; McGill Univ, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada; York Univ, Dept Earth & Space Sci & Engn, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada","Hocking, WK (reprint author), Univ Western Ontario, Dept Phys & Astron, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada.",whocking@uwo.ca,"Strong, Kimberly/D-2563-2012","Tarasick, David/0000-0001-9869-0692",,,,30,42,45,1,14,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,8-Nov,2007,450,7167,,,,,281,284,,10.1038/nature06312,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,228RC,WOS:000250746200057,17994096.0,No,,,11/20/17,p. a.,taylor,na,na,na,na,na

A deficiency of such signalling results in heterotaxia syndrome, characterized by anomalous laterality of visceral organs and complex congenital heart conditions(1). Pitx2, the transcription factor induced by the Nodal signal, regulates left-right asymmetric morphogenesis(1-4). The cellular and molecular bases of asymmetric morphogenesis remain largely unknown, however. Here we show that ablation of unilateral Pitx2 expression in mice impairs asymmetric remodelling of the branchial arch artery (BAA) system, resulting in randomized laterality of the aortic arch. Pitx2-positive cells were found not to contribute to asymmetrically remodelled arteries. Instead, Pitx2 functions in the secondary heart field(5) and induces a dynamic morphological change in the outflow tract of the heart, which results in the provision of an asymmetric blood supply to the sixth BAA. This uneven distribution of blood flow results in differential signalling by both the platelet-derived growth factor receptor and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2. The consequent stabilization of the left sixth BAA and regression of its right counterpart underlie left-sided formation of the aortic arch. Our results therefore indicate that haemodynamics, generated by a Pitx2-induced morphological change in the outflow tract, is responsible for the asymmetric remodelling of the great arteries.","Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Frontier Biosci, Dev Genet Grp, Osaka 5650871, Japan; Japan Sci & Technol Corp, CREST, Osaka 5650871, Japan","Yashiro, K (reprint author), Univ London, Barts & London Queen Marys Sch Med & Dent, William Harvey Res Inst, Charterhouse Sq, London EC1M 6BQ, England.",k.yashiro@qmul.ac.uk; hamada@fbs.osaka-u.ac.jp,,,,,,27,126,131,3,11,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,8-Nov,2007,450,7167,,,,,285,U11,,10.1038/nature06254,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,228RC,WOS:000250746200058,17994097.0,No,,,11/20/17,hiroshi,hamada,na,na,na,na,na

Several CD36 proteins function in the immune system as scavenger receptors for bacterial pathogens and seem to act as cofactors for Toll-like receptors by facilitating recognition of bacterially derived lipids(2-4). Here we show that a Drosophila melanogaster CD36 homologue, Sensory neuron membrane protein (SNMP), is expressed in a population of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) implicated in pheromone detection. SNMP is essential for the electrophysiological responses of OSNs expressing the receptor OR67d to (Z)-11-octadecenyl acetate (cis-vaccenyl acetate, cVA), a volatile male-specific fatty-acid-derived pheromone that regulates sexual and social aggregation behaviours(5-8). SNMP is also required for the activation of the moth pheromone receptor HR13 by its lipid-derived pheromone ligand (Z)-11-hexadecenal(9), but is dispensable for the responses of the conventional odorant receptor OR22a to its short hydrocarbon fruit ester ligands. Finally, we show that SNMP is required for responses of OR67d to cVA when ectopically expressed in OSNs not normally activated by pheromones. Because mammalian CD36 binds fatty acids(10), we suggest that SNMP acts in concert with odorant receptors to capture pheromone molecules on the surface of olfactory dendrites. Our work identifies an unanticipated cofactor for odorant receptors that is likely to have a widespread role in insect pheromone detection. Moreover, these results define a unifying model for CD36 function, coupling recognition of lipid-based extracellular ligands to signalling receptors in both pheromonal communication and pathogen recognition through the innate immune system.","Rockefeller Univ, Lab Neurogenet & Behav, New York, NY 10065 USA","Vosshall, LB (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Lab Neurogenet & Behav, 1230 York Ave,Box 63, New York, NY 10065 USA.",leslie@mail.rockefeller.edu,,"Vosshall, Leslie/0000-0002-6060-8099",,,,39,233,251,4,49,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Nov,2007,450,7167,,,,,289,U13,,10.1038/nature06328,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,228RC,WOS:000250746200059,17943085.0,No,,,11/20/17,leslie b.,vosshall,na,na,na,na,na

Birds, reptiles and insects all show preferences for specific humidities that influence their mating, reproduction and geographic distribution(1,2). Because of their large surface area to volume ratio, insects are particularly sensitive to humidity, and its detection can influence their survival(3-7). Two types of hygroreceptors exist in insects: one responds to an increase (moist receptor) and the other to a reduction (dry receptor) in humidity(4,6,8). Although previous data indicated that mechanosensation might contribute to hygrosensation(6,9), the cellular basis of hygrosensation and the genes involved in detecting humidity remain unknown. To understand better the molecular bases of humidity sensing, we investigated several genes encoding channels associated with mechanosensation, thermosensing or water transport. Here we identify two Drosophila melanogaster transient receptor potential channels needed for sensing humidity: CG31284, named by us water witch (wtrw), which is required to detect moist air, and nanchung (nan), which is involved in detecting dry air. Neurons associated with specialized sensory hairs in the third segment of the antenna express these channels, and neurons expressing wtrw and nan project to central nervous system regions associated with mechanosensation. Construction of the hygrosensing system with opposing receptors may allow an organism to very sensitively detect changes in environmental humidity.","Univ Iowa, Roy J & Lucille A Carver Coll Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Internal Med, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; Univ Iowa, Roy J & Lucille A Carver Coll Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; Univ Illinois, Dept Cell & Struct Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; Chonnam Natl Univ, Sch Biol Sci & Technol, Hormone Res Ctr, Kwangju 500757, South Korea","Welsh, MJ (reprint author), Univ Iowa, Roy J & Lucille A Carver Coll Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Internal Med, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",michael-welsh@uiowa.edu,,,,,,30,91,91,0,21,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Nov,2007,450,7167,,,,,294,U14,,10.1038/nature06223,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,228RC,WOS:000250746200060,17994098.0,No,,,11/20/17,michael j.,welsh,na,na,na,na,na

Here we define a newly discovered pathway that prevents autoimmunity by limiting the levels on T lymphocytes of a co-stimulatory receptor, the inducible T-cell co-stimulator (ICOS). In sanroque mice homozygous for an M199R mutation in the ROQ domain of Roquin (also known as Rc3h1)(1), increased Icos expression on T cells causes the accumulation of lymphocytes that is associated with a lupus-like autoimmune syndrome. Roquin normally limits Icos expression by promoting the degradation of Icos messenger RNA. A conserved segment in the unusually long ICOS 39 untranslated mRNA is essential for regulation by Roquin. This segment comprises a 47-base-pair minimal region complementary to T-cell-expressed microRNAs including miR-101, the repressive activity of which is disrupted by base-pair inversions predicted to abrogate miR-101 binding. These findings illuminate a critical post-transcriptional pathway within T cells that regulates lymphocyte accumulation and autoimmunity, and highlights the therapeutic potential of partially antagonising the ICOS pathway.","Australian Natl Univ, John Curtin Sch Med Res, Div Immunol & Genet, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; ASTAR, Inst Biomed Sci, Cellular & Mol Immunol Lab, Singapore 138673, Singapore; Australian Natl Univ, ARC Ctr Mol Genet Dev, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; Robert Koch Inst, D-13353 Berlin, Germany; Univ Western Australia, Med Res Ctr, Western Australian Inst Med Res, Lab Canc Med, Perth, WA 6000, Australia; Univ Western Australia, Sch Med & Pharmacol, Perth, WA 6000, Australia; Australian Phenom Facil, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia","Vinuesa, CG (reprint author), Australian Natl Univ, John Curtin Sch Med Res, Div Immunol & Genet, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",carola.vinuesa@anu.edu.au,"Yu, Di/C-2163-2009; Lam, Kong-Peng/G-5374-2012; Vinuesa, Carola/B-1108-2010; Hutloff, Andreas/D-1781-2014; Leedman, Peter/O-4044-2014","Yu, Di/0000-0003-1721-8922; Vinuesa, Carola/0000-0001-9799-0298; Hutloff, Andreas/0000-0002-0572-8151; Lam, Kong-Peng/0000-0002-1316-4333",,,,30,246,262,0,10,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,8-Nov,2007,450,7167,,,,,299,U15,,10.1038/nature06253,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,228RC,WOS:000250746200061,18172933.0,No,,,11/20/17,carola g.,vinuesa,na,na,na,na,na

Implicated in heterochromatin formation and transcriptional silencing in Drosophila are Piwi (P-element induced wimpy testis)(1,2) and repeat-associated small interfering RNAs (rasiRNAs)(3-5). Despite this, the role of Piwi in rasiRNA expression and heterochromatic silencing remains unknown. Here we report the identification and characterization of 12,903 Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) in Drosophila, showing that rasiRNAs represent a subset of piRNAs. We also show that Piwi promotes euchromatic histone modifications and piRNA transcription in subtelomeric heterochromatin (also known as telomere-associated sequence, or TAS), on the right arm of chromosome 3 (3R-TAS). Piwi binds to 3R-TAS and a piRNA uniquely mapped to 3R-TAS (3R-TAS1 piRNA). In piwi mutants, 3R-TAS loses euchromatic histone modifications yet accumulates heterochromatic histone modifications and Heterochromatin Protein 1a (HP1a). Furthermore, the expression of both the 3R-TAS1 piRNA and a white reporter gene in 3R-TAS becomes suppressed. A P element inserted 128 base pairs downstream of the 3R-TAS1 piRNA coding sequence restores the euchromatic histone modifications of 3R-TAS and the expression of 3R-TAS1 piRNA in piwi mutants, as well as partly rescuing their defects in germline stem-cell maintenance. These observations suggest that Piwi promotes the euchromatic character of 3R-TAS heterochromatin and its transcriptional activity, opposite to the known roles of Piwi and the RNA-mediated interference pathway in epigenetic silencing. This activating function is probably achieved through interaction with at least 3R-TAS1 piRNA and is essential for germline stem-cell maintenance.","Duke Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; Yale Univ, Sch Med, Yale Stem Cell Ctr, New Haven, CT 06509 USA; Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, New Haven, CT 06509 USA","Lin, HF (reprint author), Duke Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, Durham, NC 27710 USA.",haifan.lin@yale.edu,,,,,,27,247,264,1,41,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Nov,2007,450,7167,,,,,304,U16,,10.1038/nature06263,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,228RC,WOS:000250746200062,17952056.0,No,,,11/20/17,haifan,lin,na,na,na,na,na

With the use of a genome-wide RNAi screen, the JHDM1B worm orthologue (T26A5.5) was identified as a gene that regulates growth(5). In the mouse, four independent screens have identified JHDM1B as a putative tumour suppressor by retroviral insertion analysis(6-9). Here we identify human JHDM1B as a nucleolar protein and show that JHDM1B preferentially binds the transcribed region of ribosomal DNA to repress the transcription of ribosomal RNA genes. We also show that repression of ribosomal RNA genes by JHDM1B is dependent on its JmjC domain, which is necessary for the specific demethylation of trimethylated lysine 4 on histone H3 in the nucleolus. In agreement with the notion that ribosomal RNA synthesis and cell growth are coupled processes, we show a JmjC-domain-dependent negative effect of JHDM1B on cell size and cell proliferation. Because aberrant ribosome biogenesis and the disruption of epigenetic control mechanisms contribute to cellular transformation, these results, together with the low levels of JHDM1B expression found in aggressive brain tumours, suggest a role for JHDM1B in cancer development.","NYU, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Inst Canc, New York, NY 10016 USA","Pagano, M (reprint author), NYU, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Inst Canc, 550 1st Ave, New York, NY 10016 USA.",michele.pagano@nyumc.org,,"pagano, michele/0000-0003-3210-2442",,,,31,142,148,0,11,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,8-Nov,2007,450,7167,,,,,309,U17,,10.1038/nature06255,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,228RC,WOS:000250746200063,17994099.0,No,,,11/20/17,michele,pagano,female,0.7,1311,na,na

The assumption of non-interacting species leads to a sampling theory for the RSA that yields a simple approximation at large scales to the exact theory.

This endogenous, ATP-mediated signalling synchronizes the output of neighbouring inner hair cells, which may help refine tonotopic maps in the brain. Spontaneous ATP-dependent signalling rapidly subsides after the onset of hearing, thereby preventing this experience-independent activity from interfering with accurate encoding of sound.

Here we characterize information processing by Caenorhabditis elegans olfactory neurons (AWC) and interneurons (AIB and AIY) that control food- and odour-evoked behaviours. Using calcium imaging and mutations that affect specific neuronal connections, we show that AWC neurons are activated by odour removal and activate the AIB interneurons through AMPA-type glutamate receptors. The level of calcium in AIB interneurons is elevated for several minutes after odour removal, a neuronal correlate to the prolonged behavioural response to odour withdrawal. The AWC neuron inhibits AIY interneurons through glutamate-gated chloride channels; odour presentation relieves this inhibition and results in activation of AIY interneurons. The opposite regulation of AIY and AIB interneurons generates a coordinated behavioural response. Information processing by this circuit resembles information flow from vertebrate photoreceptors to 'OFF' bipolar and 'ON' bipolar neurons, indicating a conserved or convergent strategy for sensory information processing.","Rockefeller Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Lab Neural Circuits & Behav, New York, NY 10065 USA; Stanford Univ, Program Neurobiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Dept Cellular & Mol Physiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Bargmann, CI (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Lab Neural Circuits & Behav, New York, NY 10065 USA.",cori@rockefeller.edu,,"Bargmann, Cornelia/0000-0002-8484-0618; Goodman, Miriam B./0000-0002-5810-1272",NINDS NIH HHS [R01 NS047715],,,50,260,269,2,46,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Nov,2007,450,7166,,,,,63,+,,10.1038/nature06292,,9,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,226JR,WOS:000250585800036,17972877.0,No,,,11/20/17,cornelia i.,bargmann,na,na,na,na,na

It is becoming increasingly accepted(1) that bipolar outflows are generated and collimated as material is driven along magnetic field lines and centrifugally accelerated off a rotating accretion disk. However, the precise role of the magnetic field is poorly understood and evidence for its shape and structure has not been forthcoming. Here we report imaging circular polarimetry in the near-infrared and Monte Carlo modelling showing that the magnetic field along the bipolar outflow of the HH 135-136 young stellar object is helical. The field retains this shape for large distances along the outflow, so the field structure can also provide the necessary magnetic pressure for collimation of the outflow. This result lends further weight to the hypothesis-central to any theory of star formation-that the outflow is an important instrument for the removal of high-angular-momentum material from the accretion disk, thereby allowing the central protostar to increase its mass.","Univ Hertfordshire, Sci & Technol Res Inst, Ctr Astrophys Res, Hatfield AL10 9AB, Herts, England","Lucas, PW (reprint author), Univ Hertfordshire, Sci & Technol Res Inst, Ctr Astrophys Res, Hatfield AL10 9AB, Herts, England.",p.w.lucas@herts.ac.uk,,,,,,26,20,20,0,6,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Nov,2007,450,7166,,,,,71,73,,10.1038/nature06220,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,226JR,WOS:000250585800037,17972878.0,No,,,11/20/17,james h.,hough,na,na,na,na,na

Winds launched from a rotating accretion disk surrounding the black hole are thought to play a critical role, allowing the disk to shed angular momentum that would otherwise inhibit accretion(3,4). Such winds are capable of depositing large amounts of mechanical energy in the host galaxy and its environs, profoundly affecting its formation and evolution(5-7), and perhaps regulating the formation of large-scale cosmological structures in the early Universe(8,9). Although there are good theoretical grounds for believing that outflows from active galactic nuclei originate as disk winds(10), observational verification has proven elusive. Here we show that structures observed in polarized light across the broad Ha emission line in the quasar PG 17001518 originate close to the accretion disk in an electron scattering wind. The wind has large rotational motions (similar to 4,000 km s(-1)), providing direct observational evidence that outflows from active galactic nuclei are launched from the disks. Moreover, the wind rises nearly vertically from the disk, favouring launch mechanisms that impart an initial acceleration perpendicular to the disk plane.","Rochester Inst Technol, Dept Phys, Rochester, NY 14623 USA; Univ Hertfordshire, Sci & Technol Res Inst, Ctr Astrophys Res, Hatfield AL10 9AB, Herts, England","Young, S (reprint author), Rochester Inst Technol, Dept Phys, 84 Lomb Mem Dr, Rochester, NY 14623 USA.",sxysps@rit.edu,"lewchavaroj, runglawan/B-5191-2009",,,,,30,38,38,0,0,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Nov,2007,450,7166,,,,,74,76,,10.1038/nature06319,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,226JR,WOS:000250585800038,17972879.0,No,,,11/20/17,j. e.,smith,na,na,na,na,na

This quantity, known as a first-passage time (FPT), has led to a growing number of theoretical investigations over the past decade(1). The importance of FPTs originates from the crucial role played by first encounter properties in various real situations, including transport in disordered media(2,3), neuron firing dynamics(4), spreading of diseases(5) or target search processes(6-9). Most methods of determining FPT properties in confining domains have been limited to effectively one-dimensional geometries, or to higher spatial dimensions only in homogeneous media(1). Here we develop a general theory that allows accurate evaluation of the mean FPT in complex media. Our analytical approach provides a universal scaling dependence of the mean FPT on both the volume of the confining domain and the source-target distance. The analysis is applicable to a broad range of stochastic processes characterized by length-scale-invariant properties.

In underdoped high-T-c superconducting copper oxides, a pseudogap (whose relation to the superconducting gap remains a mystery) develops well above T-c (refs 1, 2). Whether the pseudogap is a distinct phenomenon or the incoherent continuation of the superconducting gap above T-c is one of the central questions in high-T-c research(3-8). Although some experimental evidence suggests that the two gaps are distinct(9-18), this issue is still under intense debate. A crucial piece of evidence to firmly establish this two-gap picture is still missing: a direct and unambiguous observation of a single-particle gap tied to the superconducting transition as function of temperature. Here we report the discovery of such an energy gap in underdoped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+delta in the momentum space region overlooked in previous measurements. Near the diagonal of Cu-O bond direction (nodal direction), we found a gap that opens at T-c and has a canonical (BCS-like) temperature dependence accompanied by the appearance of the so-called Bogoliubov quasi-particles, a classical signature of superconductivity. This is in sharp contrast to the pseudogap near the Cu-O bond direction (antinodal region) measured in earlier experiments(19-21).","Stanford Univ, Dept Phys, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Stanford Synchrotron Radiat Lab, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Tokyo, Dept Appl Phys, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138656, Japan; Univ Waterloo, Dept Phys, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada","Shen, ZX (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Phys, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",leews@stanford.edu; zxshen@stanford.edu,"Nagaosa, Naoto/G-7057-2012; Sasagawa, Takao/E-6666-2014","Sasagawa, Takao/0000-0003-0149-6696",,,,28,277,280,5,64,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,1-Nov,2007,450,7166,,,,,81,84,,10.1038/nature06219,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,226JR,WOS:000250585800040,17972881.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,z.-x.,shen,na,na,na,na,na

A severe limitation in scanning tunnelling microscopy is the low temporal resolution, originating from the diminished high-frequency response of the tunnel current readout circuitry. Here we overcome this limitation by measuring the reflection from a resonant inductor-capacitor circuit in which the tunnel junction is embedded, and demonstrate electronic bandwidths as high as 10 MHz. This similar to 100-fold bandwidth improvement on the state of the art translates into fast surface topography as well as delicate measurements in mesoscopic electronics and mechanics. Broadband noise measurements across the tunnel junction using this radio-frequency STM have allowed us to perform thermometry at the nanometre scale. Furthermore, we have detected high-frequency mechanical motion with a sensitivity approaching similar to 15 fm Hz(-1/2).

Previous attempts to assess quantitatively the effect of changing environmental conditions on the net boreal forest carbon balance have not taken into account the competition between different vegetation types on a large scale(6-9). Here we use a process model with three competing vascular and non-vascular vegetation types to examine the effects of climate, carbon dioxide concentrations and fire disturbance on net biome production, net primary production and vegetation dominance in 100 Mha of Canadian boreal forest. We find that the carbon balance of this region was driven by changes in fire disturbance from 1948 to 2005. Climate changes affected the variability, but not the mean, of the landscape carbon balance, with precipitation exerting a more significant effect than temperature. We show that more frequent and larger fires in the late twentieth century resulted in deciduous trees and mosses increasing production at the expense of coniferous trees. Our model did not however exhibit the increases in total forest net primary production that have been inferred from satellite data(1,10). We find that poor soil drainage decreased the variability of the landscape carbon balance, which suggests that increased climate and hydrological changes have the potential to affect disproportionately the carbon dynamics of these areas. Overall, we conclude that direct ecophysiological changes resulting from global climate change have not yet been felt in this large boreal region. Variations in the landscape carbon balance and vegetation dominance have so far been driven largely by increases in fire frequency.","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Bond-Lamberty, B (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, 1630 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",bpbond@wisc.edu,"Bond-Lamberty, Ben/C-6058-2008","Bond-Lamberty, Ben/0000-0001-9525-4633",,,,30,243,246,4,120,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,1-Nov,2007,450,7166,,,,,89,+,,10.1038/nature06272,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,226JR,WOS:000250585800042,17972883.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,stith t.,gower,na,na,na,na,na

Reefs in the Caribbean are among the most heavily affected(2,3), having experienced mass disease-induced mortality of the herbivorous urchin Diadema antillarum(4) in 1983 and two framework-building species of coral(5). Declining reef health is characterized by increases in macroalgae. A critical question is whether the observed macroalgal bloom on Caribbean reefs is easily reversible. To answer this question, we must resolve whether algal-dominated reefs are an alternative stable state of the ecosystem or simply the readily reversible result of a phase change along a gradient of some environmental or ecological parameter(6). Here, using a fully parameterized simulation model in combination with a simple analytical model, we show that Caribbean reefs became susceptible to alternative stable states once the urchin mortality event of 1983 confined the majority of grazing to parrotfishes. We reveal dramatic hysteresis in a natural system(7,8) and define critical thresholds of grazing and coral cover beyond which resilience is lost. Most grazing thresholds lie near the upper level observed for parrotfishes in nature, suggesting that reefs are highly sensitive to parrotfish exploitation. Ecosystem thresholds can be combined with stochastic models of disturbance to identify targets for the restoration of ecosystem processes. We illustrate this principle by estimating the relationship between current reef state (coral cover and grazing) and the probability that the reef will withstand moderate hurricane intensity for two decades without becoming entrained in a shift towards a stable macroalgal-dominated state. Such targets may help reef managers face the challenge of addressing global disturbance at local scales.","Univ Exeter, Sch Biosci, Marine Spatial Ecol Lab, Exeter EX4 4PS, Devon, England; Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Mumby, PJ (reprint author), Univ Exeter, Sch Biosci, Marine Spatial Ecol Lab, Prince Wales Rd, Exeter EX4 4PS, Devon, England.",p.j.mumby@ex.ac.uk,"Hastings, Alan/A-7423-2008; Edwards, Helen/D-1633-2009; Mumby, Peter/F-9914-2010","Edwards, Helen/0000-0003-1174-8009; ",,,,26,362,374,24,308,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Nov,2007,450,7166,,,,,98,101,,10.1038/nature06252,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,226JR,WOS:000250585800044,17972885.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,helen j.,edwards,na,na,na,na,na

Complex interrelated neuronal circuits have developed in the mammalian brain to regulate many aspects of feeding behaviour, from food-seeking to meal termination. The hypothalamus and brainstem are thought to be the principal homeostatic brain areas responsible for regulating body weight(1,2). However, in the current 'obesogenic' human environment food intake is largely determined by non-homeostatic factors including cognition, emotion and reward, which are primarily processed in corticolimbic and higher cortical brain regions(3). Although the pleasure of eating is modulated by satiety and food deprivation increases the reward value of food, there is currently no adequate neurobiological account of this interaction between homeostatic and higher centres in the regulation of food intake in humans(1,4,5). Here we show, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, that peptide YY(3-36) (PYY), a physiological gut-derived satiety signal, modulates neural activity within both corticolimbic and higher-cortical areas as well as homeostatic brain regions. Under conditions of high plasma PYY concentrations, mimicking the fed state, changes in neural activity within the caudolateral orbital frontal cortex predict feeding behaviour independently of meal-related sensory experiences. In contrast, in conditions of low levels of PYY, hypothalamic activation predicts food intake. Thus, the presence of a postprandial satiety factor switches food intake regulation from a homeostatic to a hedonic, corticolimbic area. Our studies give insights into the neural networks in humans that respond to a specific satiety signal to regulate food intake. An increased understanding of how such homeostatic and higher brain functions are integrated may pave the way for the development of new treatment strategies for obesity.","UCL, Dept Med, Ctr Diabet & Endocrinol, London WC1E 6JJ, England; Kings Coll London, Ctr Neuroimaging Sci, Inst Psychiat, London SE5 8AF, England","Batterham, RL (reprint author), UCL, Dept Med, Ctr Diabet & Endocrinol, London WC1E 6JJ, England.",r.batterham@ucl.ac.uk,"; Barker, Gareth/C-9616-2009; Williams, Steve/D-6979-2011; Zelaya, Fernando/I-3125-2012; Withers, Dominic/D-7671-2014","opoku, anita/0000-0001-7243-8157; ffytche, Dominic/0000-0002-4214-9642; Barker, Gareth/0000-0002-5214-7421; Williams, Steve/0000-0003-4299-1941; Withers, Dominic/0000-0002-8009-7521; Batterham, Rachel/0000-0002-5477-8585",Medical Research Council [G108/551],,,38,242,246,1,26,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Nov,2007,450,7166,,,,,106,+,,10.1038/nature06212,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,226JR,WOS:000250585800046,17934448.0,No,,,11/20/17,steven c. r.,williams,na,na,na,na,na

They are also the staging ground of adaptive immune responses to pathogen-derived antigens(1,2). It is unclear how virus particles are cleared from afferent lymph and presented to cognate B cells to induce antibody responses. Here we identify a population of CD11b(+)CD169(+)MHCII(+) macrophages on the floor of the subcapsular sinus (SCS) and in the medulla of lymph nodes that capture viral particles within minutes after subcutaneous injection. Macrophages in the SCS translocated surface-bound viral particles across the SCS floor and presented them to migrating B cells in the underlying follicles. Selective depletion of these macrophages compromised local viral retention, exacerbated viraemia of the host, and impaired local B-cell activation. These findings indicate that CD169(+) macrophages have a dual physiological function. They act as innate 'flypaper' by preventing the systemic spread of lymph-borne pathogens and as critical gatekeepers at the lymph-tissue interface that facilitate the recognition of particulate antigens by B cells and initiate humoral immune responses.","Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Immune Dis Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Dermatol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Ist Sci San Raffaele, Immunopathogenesis Liver Infect Unit, I-20132 Milan, Italy; Univ Zurich Hosp, Inst Expt Immunol, CH-8091 Zurich, Switzerland; Novartis Inst Trop Dis, Singapore 138670, Singapore; Univ Washington, Dept Med, Div Med Genet, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Vrije Univ Amsterdam, VUMC, Fac Med, Dept Mol Cell Biol, NL-1081 BT Amsterdam, Netherlands; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Mol Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA","von Andrian, UH (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Immune Dis Inst, 77 Ave Louis Pasteur, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",uva@hms.harvard.edu,"Iannacone, Matteo/B-3342-2008; von Andrian, Ulrich/A-5775-2008","Iannacone, Matteo/0000-0002-9370-2671","NIAID NIH HHS [R01 AI059371, R01 AI059371-03]; NIGMS NIH HHS [T32 GM007753]",,,29,383,386,0,27,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Nov,2007,450,7166,,,,,110,+,,10.1038/nature06287,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,226JR,WOS:000250585800047,17934446.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,ulrich h.,von andrian,na,na,na,na,na

In bacteria, translocation is through the type III secretion system(1), but analogous processes for effector delivery are uncharacterized in fungi and oomycetes. Here we report functional analyses of two motifs, RXLR and EER, present in translocated oomycete effectors(2). We use the Phytophthora infestans RXLR-EER-containing protein Avr3a as a reporter for translocation because it triggers RXLR-EER-independent hypersensitive cell death following recognition within plant cells that contain the R3a resistance protein(4,5). We show that Avr3a, with or without RXLR-EER motifs, is secreted from P. infestans biotrophic structures called haustoria, demonstrating that these motifs are not required for targeting to haustoria or for secretion. However, following replacement of Avr3a RXLR-EER motifs with alanine residues, singly or in combination, or with residues KMIK-DDK-representing a change that conserves physicochemical properties of the protein-P. infestans fails to deliver Avr3a or an Avr3a-GUS fusion protein into plant cells, demonstrating that these motifs are required for translocation. We show that RXLR-EER-encoding genes are transcriptionally upregulated during infection. Bioinformatic analysis identifies 425 potential genes encoding secreted RXLR-EER class proteins in the P. infestans genome. Identification of this class of proteins provides unparalleled opportunities to determine how oomycetes manipulate hosts to establish infection.","Scottish Crop Res Inst, Plant Pathol Programme, Dundee DD2 5DA, Scotland; Univ Aberdeen, Inst Med Sci, Aberdeen Oomycete Grp, Aberdeen AB25 2ZD, Scotland","Birch, PRJ (reprint author), Scottish Crop Res Inst, Plant Pathol Programme, Dundee DD2 5DA, Scotland.",Paul.Birch@scri.ac.uk,"Pritchard, Leighton/A-7331-2008; Moleleki, Lucy/E-8951-2010; Birch, Paul/F-7681-2012; Chapman, Sean/H-5193-2013","Pritchard, Leighton/0000-0002-8392-2822; van West, Pieter/0000-0002-0767-6017; Gilroy, Eleanor/0000-0002-5301-4268; Birch, Paul/0000-0002-6559-3746",Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/E007120/1],,,27,384,396,8,114,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Nov,2007,450,7166,,,,,115,+,,10.1038/nature06203,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,226JR,WOS:000250585800048,17914356.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,paul r. j.,birch,na,na,na,na,na

So far, LSD1 (also known as AOF2) and the jumonji C (JmjC)-domain-containing proteins have been shown to possess histone demethylase activity. LSD1 catalyses removal of H3K4me2/H3K4me1 through a flavin-adenine-dinucleotide-dependent oxidation reaction(3). In contrast, JmjC-domain-containing proteins remove methyl groups from histones through a hydroxylation reaction that requires alpha-ketoglutarate and Fe(II) as cofactors(4). Although an increasing number of histone demethylases have been identified and biochemically characterized(1,2), their biological functions, particularly in the context of an animal model, are poorly characterized. Here we use a loss-of-function approach to demonstrate that the mouse H3K9me2/1-specific demethylase JHDM2A (JmjC-domain-containing histone demethylase 2A, also known as JMJD1A) is essential for spermatogenesis. We show that Jhdm2a-deficient mice exhibit post-meiotic chromatin condensation defects, and that JHDM2A directly binds to and controls the expression of transition nuclear protein 1 (Tnp1) and protamine 1 (Prm1) genes, the products of which are required for packaging and condensation of sperm chromatin. Thus, our work uncovers a role for JHDM2A in spermatogenesis and reveals transition nuclear protein and protamine genes as direct targets of JHDM2A.","Univ N Carolina, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; Univ N Carolina, Lineberger Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; NIH, Knock Out Core, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; NIH, Mol Dev Biol Grp, Reprod & Dev Toxicol Lab, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA","Zhang, Y (reprint author), Univ N Carolina, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",yi_zhang@med.unc.edu,,,,,,23,184,205,0,21,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Nov,2007,450,7166,,,,,119,+,,10.1038/nature06236,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,226JR,WOS:000250585800049,17943087.0,No,,,11/20/17,yi,zhang,female,0.56,68,na,na

Although catalysis is thought to proceed through a substitution nucleophilic bimolecular (S(N)2) reaction(1,2), the role of the enzyme in modulating this chemical reaction is unknown. Here, using single-molecule force-clamp spectroscopy(3,4), we investigate the catalytic mechanism of Escherichia coli thioredoxin (Trx). We applied mechanical force in the range of 25-600 pN to a disulphide bond substrate and monitored the reduction of these bonds by individual enzymes. We detected two alternative forms of the catalytic reaction, the first requiring a reorientation of the substrate disulphide bond, causing a shortening of the substrate polypeptide by 0.79 +/- 0.09 angstrom (+/- s.e.m.), and the second elongating the substrate disulphide bond by 0.17 +/- 0.02 angstrom (+/- s.e.m.). These results support the view that the Trx active site regulates the geometry of the participating sulphur atoms with sub-angstrom precision to achieve efficient catalysis. Our results indicate that substrate conformational changes may be important in the regulation of Trx activity under conditions of oxidative stress and mechanical injury, such as those experienced in cardiovascular disease(5,6). Furthermore, single-molecule atomic force microscopy techniques, as shown here, can probe dynamic rearrangements within an enzyme's active site during catalysis that cannot be resolved with any other current structural biological technique.","Columbia Univ, Dept Biol Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA; Columbia Univ, Grad Program Neurobiol & Behav, New York, NY 10027 USA; Columbia Univ, Dept Phys, New York, NY 10027 USA; Columbia Univ, Dept Chem, New York, NY 10027 USA; Karolinska Inst, Med Nobel Inst Biochem, Dept Med Biochem & Biophys, SE-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias, Dept Quim Fis, E-18071 Granada, Spain","Fernandez, JM (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Dept Biol Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA.",jfernandez@columbia.edu,"Sanchez-Ruiz, Jose/H-2849-2015; Perez-Jimenez, Raul/C-3085-2017; Grater, Frauke/D-3450-2009","Sanchez-Ruiz, Jose/0000-0002-9056-3928; Perez-Jimenez, Raul/0000-0001-7094-6799; Grater, Frauke/0000-0003-2891-3381","NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM043340, R01 GM043340-19]",,,42,166,169,1,45,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,1-Nov,2007,450,7166,,,,,124,+,,10.1038/nature06231,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,226JR,WOS:000250585800050,17972886.0,No,,,11/20/17,julio m.,fernandez,na,na,na,na,na

Here, using two knock-in alleles, we reveal exclusive expression of Lgr5 in cycling columnar cells at the crypt base. In addition, Lgr5 was expressed in rare cells in several other tissues. Using an inducible Cre knock-in allele and the Rosa26-lacZ reporter strain, lineage-tracing experiments were performed in adult mice.

In our model, the stable accumulation of auxin in a distal maximum emerges from the auxin flux pattern. We have experimentally tested model predictions of robustness and self-organization. Our model explains pattern formation and morphogenesis at timescales from seconds to weeks, and can be understood by conceptualizing the root as an 'auxin capacitor'. A robust auxin gradient associated with the maximum, in combination with separable roles of auxin in cell division and cell expansion, is able to explain the formation, maintenance and growth of sharply bounded meristematic and elongation zones.

However, their mechanisms of action, and what determines which RNA species are targeted, are not well understood. Here we show that the DExD/H-box protein CYT-19, a general RNA chaperone, mediates ATP-dependent unfolding of both the native conformation and a long-lived misfolded conformation of a group I catalytic RNA with efficiencies that depend on the stabilities of the RNA species but not on specific structural features. CYT-19 then allows the RNA to refold, changing the distribution from equilibrium to kinetic control. Because misfolding is favoured kinetically, conditions that allow unfolding of the native RNA yield large increases in the population of misfolded species. Our results suggest that DExD/H-box proteins act with sufficient breadth and efficiency to allow structured RNAs to populate a wider range of conformations than would be present at equilibrium. Thus, RNAs may face selective pressure to stabilize their active conformations relative to inactive ones to avoid significant redistribution by DExD/H-box proteins. Conversely, RNAs whose functions depend on forming multiple conformations may rely on DExD/H-box proteins to increase the populations of less stable conformations, thereby increasing their overall efficiencies.","Univ Texas, Dept Chem & Biochem, Inst Mol & Cellular Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Russell, R (reprint author), Univ Texas, Dept Chem & Biochem, Inst Mol & Cellular Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",rick_russell@mail.utexas.edu,"Russell, Rick/A-9256-2012",,"NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM070456, R01 GM070456-04]",,,48,63,66,1,5,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,25-Oct,2007,449,7165,,,,,1014,U2,,10.1038/nature06235,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,223TK,WOS:000250395000043,17960235.0,No,,,11/20/17,rick,russell,male,1,1255,Hp4Ec54AAAAJ,6545

The recent detection of four propeller-shaped features in Saturn's A ring(2) proved the presence of large boulder-sized moonlets in the rings(3-5). Their existence favours ring creation in a catastrophic disruption of an icy satellite rather than a co-genetic origin with Saturn, because bodies of this size are unlikely to have accreted inside the rings. Here we report the detection of eight new propeller features in an image sequence that covers the complete A ring, indicating embedded moonlets with radii between 30 m and 70 m. We show that the moonlets found are concentrated in a narrow 3,000-km-wide annulus 130,000 km from Saturn. Compared to the main population of ring particles(6-8) (radius s < 10 m), such embedded moonlets have a short lifetime(9) with respect to meteoroid impacts. Therefore, they are probably the remnants of a shattered ring-moon of Pan size or larger(2), locally contributing new material to the older ring.

Many hundreds of exotic neutron-rich isotopes have never been observed; the limit of how many neutrons a given number of protons can bind is unknown for all but the lightest elements(1), owing to the delicate interplay between single particle and collective quantum effects in the nucleus. This limit, known as the neutron drip line, provides a benchmark for models of the atomic nucleus. Here we report a significant advance in the determination of this limit: the discovery of two new neutron-rich isotopes-Mg-40 and Al-42-that are predicted to be drip-line nuclei(2). In the past, several attempts to observe Mg-40 were unsuccessful(3,4); moreover, the observation of Al-42 provides an experimental indication that the neutron drip line may be located further towards heavier isotopes in this mass region than is currently believed. In stable nuclei, attractive pairing forces enhance the stability of isotopes with even numbers of protons and neutrons. In contrast, the present work shows that nuclei at the drip line gain stability from an unpaired proton, which narrows the shell gaps and provides the opportunity to bind many more neutrons(5,6).","Michigan State Univ, Natl Superconducting Cyclotron Lab, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; Michigan State Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; Michigan State Univ, Dept Chem, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; Joint Inst Nucl Res, Flerov Lab Nucl React, Dubna 141980, Moscow Region, Russia","Baumann, T (reprint author), Michigan State Univ, Natl Superconducting Cyclotron Lab, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",baumann@nscl.msu.edu,"Gade, Alexandra/A-6850-2008; Sherrill, Bradley/B-4098-2009; Sherrill, Bradley/B-3378-2011; Matos, Milan/G-6947-2012; Folden, Charles/F-1033-2015","Gade, Alexandra/0000-0001-8825-0976; Matos, Milan/0000-0003-1722-9509; Folden, Charles/0000-0002-2814-3762",,,,20,115,115,1,12,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,25-Oct,2007,449,7165,,,,,1022,1024,,10.1038/nature06213,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,223TK,WOS:000250395000045,17960237.0,No,,,11/20/17,m.,thoennessen,na,na,na,na,na

Although this observation has been replicated in various laboratories(3-6), no thermodynamic signature of the possible supersolid transition has been seen.

Yet it remains challenging to probe electronic processes, many of which take place in the attosecond (1 as = 10(-18) s) regime. In contrast, atomic motion occurs on the femtosecond (1 fs = 10(-15) s) timescale and has been mapped in solids in real time(1,2) using femtosecond X-ray sources(3). Here we extend the attosecond techniques(4,5) previously used to study isolated atoms in the gas phase to observe electron motion in condensed-matter systems and on surfaces in real time. We demonstrate our ability to obtain direct time-domain access to charge dynamics with attosecond resolution by probing photoelectron emission from single-crystal tungsten. Our data reveal a delay of approximately 100 attoseconds between the emission of photoelectrons that originate from localized core states of the metal, and those that are freed from delocalized conduction-band states.

Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization(6,7) (MALDI) and electrospray ionization(8) have been at the forefront of these developments. However, matrix application complicates the use of MALDI for cellular, tissue, biofluid and microarray analysis and can limit the spatial resolution because of the matrix crystal size(9) (typically more than 10 mu m), sensitivity and detection of small compounds (less than 500 Da). Secondary-ion mass spectrometry(10) has extremely high lateral resolution (100 nm) and has found biological applications(11,12) although the energetic desorption/ionization is a limitation owing to molecular fragmentation. Here we introduce nanostructure- initiator mass spectrometry (NIMS), a tool for spatially defined mass analysis. NIMS uses 'initiator' molecules trapped in nanostructured surfaces or 'clathrates' to release and ionize intact molecules adsorbed on the surface. This surface responds to both ion and laser irradiation. The lateral resolution (ion-NIMS about 150 nm), sensitivity, matrix-free and reduced fragmentation of NIMS allows direct characterization of peptide microarrays, direct mass analysis of single cells, tissue imaging, and direct characterization of blood and urine.","Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; Scripps Res Inst, Scripps Ctr Mass Spectrometry, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; Scripps Res Inst, Dept Cell Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Mat, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; Univ Oregon, CAMCOR Surface Anal Facil, Eugene, OR 97403 USA","Siuzdak, G (reprint author), Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol Biol, 10666 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",siuzdak@scripps.edu,"Northen, Trent/K-3139-2012; Yanes, Oscar/N-3630-2016","Yanes, Oscar/0000-0003-3695-7157; Northen, Trent/0000-0001-8404-3259; Siuzdak, Gary/0000-0002-4749-0014",,,,28,288,290,24,191,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,25-Oct,2007,449,7165,,,,,1033,U3,,10.1038/nature06195,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,223TK,WOS:000250395000048,17960240.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,gary,siuzdak,male,1,2132,3BpMXA8AAAAJ,24433

He-3/He-4 ratios in many ocean-island basalts (OIBs) that erupt at hotspot volcanoes, such as Hawaii and Iceland, can be up to sixfold higher than in mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORBs). This is inferred to be the result of outgassing by melt production at mid-ocean ridges in conjunction with radiogenic ingrowth of He-4, which has led to a volatile-depleted upper mantle (MORB source) with low He-3 concentrations and low He-3/He-4 ratios(2-6). Consequently, high He-3/He-4 ratios in OIBs are conventionally viewed as evidence for an undegassed, primitive mantle source, which is sampled by hot, buoyantly upwelling deep-mantle plumes(3,6,7). However, this conventional model provides no viable explanation of why helium concentrations and elemental ratios of He/Ne and He/Ar in OIBs are an order of magnitude lower than in MORBs. This has been described as the 'helium concentration paradox'(8) and has contributed to a long-standing controversy about the structure and dynamics of the Earth's mantle. Here we show that the helium concentration paradox, as well as the full range of noble-gas concentrations observed in MORB and OIB glasses, can self-consistently be explained by disequilibrium open-system degassing of the erupting magma. We show that a higher CO2 content in OIBs than in MORBs leads to more extensive degassing of helium in OIB magmas and that noble gases in OIB lavas can be derived from a largely undegassed primitive mantle source.","Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Gonnermann, HM (reprint author), Univ Hawaii, SOEST, Dept Geol & Geophys, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",helge@hawaii.edu,"Gonnermann, Helge/B-1054-2012",,,,,33,38,39,1,19,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,25-Oct,2007,449,7165,,,,,1037,1040,,10.1038/nature06240,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,223TK,WOS:000250395000049,17960241.0,No,,,11/20/17,sujoy,mukhopadhyay,male,1,8,MXCTBcwAAAAJ,2363

The conceptual core of this body of theory is the functional response, predicting the rate of prey consumption by individual predators as a function of predator and/or prey densities(1-5). This assumption is seriously violated in many ecosystems in which predators and/or prey form social groups. Here we develop a new set of group-dependent functional responses to consider the ecological implications of sociality and apply the model to the Serengeti ecosystem. All of the prey species typically captured by Serengeti lions (Panthera leo) are gregarious, exhibiting nonlinear relationships between prey-group density and population density. The observed patterns of group formation profoundly reduce food intake rates below the levels expected under random mixing, having as strong an impact on intake rates as the seasonal migratory behaviour of the herbivores. A dynamical system model parameterized for the Serengeti ecosystem (using wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) as a well-studied example) shows that grouping strongly stabilizes interactions between lions and wildebeest. Our results suggest that social groups rather than individuals are the basic building blocks around which predator-prey interactions should be modelled and that group formation may provide the underlying stability of many ecosystems.","Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Fryxell, JM (reprint author), Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, 50 Stone Rd E, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",jfryxell@uoguelph.ca,,,,,,29,101,101,9,106,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,25-Oct,2007,449,7165,,,,,1041,U4,,10.1038/nature06177,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,223TK,WOS:000250395000050,17960242.0,No,,,11/20/17,craig,packer,male,1,1816,na,na

Levy flights are random walks, the step lengths of which come from probability distributions with heavy power-law tails(3,4), such that clusters of short steps are connected by rare long steps. Levy flights display fractal properties, have no typical scale, and occur in physical(3-5) and chemical(6) systems. An attempt to demonstrate their existence in a natural biological system presented evidence that wandering albatrosses perform Levy flights when searching for prey on the ocean surface(7). This well known finding(2,4,8,9) was followed by similar inferences about the search strategies of deer(10) and bumblebees(10). These pioneering studies have triggered much theoretical work in physics (for example, refs 11, 12), as well as empirical ecological analyses regarding reindeer(13), microzooplankton(14), grey seals(15), spider monkeys(16) and fishing boats(17). Here we analyse a new, high-resolution data set of wandering albatross flights, and find no evidence for Levy flight behaviour. Instead we find that flight times are gamma distributed, with an exponential decay for the longest flights. We re-analyse the original albatross data(7) using additional information, and conclude that the extremely long flights, essential for demonstrating Levy flight behaviour, were spurious. Furthermore, we propose a widely applicable method to test for power-law distributions using likelihood(18) and Akaike weights(19,20). We apply this to the four original deer and bumblebee data sets(10), finding that none exhibits evidence of Levy flights, and that the original graphical approach(10) is insufficient. Such a graphical approach has been adopted to conclude Levy flight movement for other organisms(13-17), and to propose Levy flight analysis as a potential real-time ecosystem monitoring tool(17). Our results question the strength of the empirical evidence for biological Levy flights.","British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England; Boston Univ, Dept Phys, Boston, MA 02215 USA; Yeshiva Univ, Dept Phys, New York, NY 10033 USA; Univ Fed Parana, Dept Fis, BR-81531990 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil; Univ Fed Pernambuco, Dept Fis, Lab Fis Teor & Computac, BR-50670901 Recife, PE, Brazil; Univ Fed Alagoas, Inst Fis, BR-57072970 Maceio, AL, Brazil","Edwards, AM (reprint author), British Antarctic Survey, High Cross, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England.",EdwardsAnd@pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca,"edwards, andrew/E-6900-2010; Viswanathan, Gandhimohan /J-8558-2012; Watkins, Nicholas/C-5140-2008; Buldyrev, Sergey/I-3933-2015; Raposo, Ernesto/N-2786-2017","Viswanathan, Gandhimohan /0000-0002-2301-5593; Watkins, Nicholas/0000-0003-4484-6588; Raposo, Ernesto/0000-0002-3595-4352; Stanley, H./0000-0003-2800-4495; Buldyrev, Sergey/0000-0002-3008-1070",,,,30,463,466,12,142,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,25-Oct,2007,449,7165,,,,,1044,U5,,10.1038/nature06199,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,223TK,WOS:000250395000051,17960243.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,gandhimohan m.,viswanathan,na,na,na,na,na

In amniotes (birds and mammals), mesendoderm formation occurs through an axial midline structure, the primitive streak(1), the formation of which is preceded by massive 'polonaise' movements(2,3) of ectoderm cells. The mechanisms controlling these processes are unknown. Here, using multi-photon time-lapse microscopy of chick (Gallus gallus) embryos, we reveal a medio-lateral cell intercalation confined to the ectodermal subdomain where the streak will later form. This intercalation event differs from the convergent extension movements of the mesoderm described in fish and amphibians (anamniotes)(4-8): it occurs before gastrulation and within a tight columnar epithelium. Fibroblast growth factor from the extra-embryonic endoderm (hypoblast, a cell layer unique to amniotes) directs the expression of Wnt planar-cell-polarity pathway components to the intercalation domain. Disruption of this Wnt pathway causes the mesendoderm to form peripherally, as in anamniotes(1,9). We propose that the amniote primitive streak evolved from the ancestral blastopore by acquisition of an additional medio-lateral intercalation event, preceding gastrulation and acting independently of mesendoderm formation to position the primitive streak at the midline.","UCL, Dept Anat & Dev Biol, London WC1E 6BT, England; Univ Virginia, Dept Biol, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA","Voiculescu, O (reprint author), UCL, Dept Anat & Dev Biol, Mortimer St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",o.voiculescu@ucl.ac.uk; c.stern@ucl.ac.uk,"Voiculescu, Octavian/C-3543-2008; Stern, Claudio/C-6265-2008; Voiculescu, Octavian/A-7571-2010","Stern, Claudio/0000-0002-9907-889X; Voiculescu, Octavian/0000-0003-0714-1482",Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/C512753/1],,,30,133,134,0,12,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,25-Oct,2007,449,7165,,,,,1049,1052,,10.1038/nature06211,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,223TK,WOS:000250395000052,17928866.0,No,,,11/20/17,claudio d.,stern,na,na,na,na,na

Here we show that a clade of four PLT homologues is necessary for root formation. Promoter activity and protein fusions of PLT homologues display gradient distributions with maxima in the stem cell area. PLT activities are largely additive and dosage dependent. High levels of PLT activity promote stem cell identity and maintenance; lower levels promote mitotic activity of stem cell daughters; and further reduction in levels is required for cell differentiation.

To direct eye development, Pax6, a key gene in this network(2,3), interacts with genes encoding other EFTFs such as Rx1 and Six3 (refs 4-6). However, the mechanisms that control expression of the EFTFs remain unclear(7). Here we show that purine-mediated signalling triggers both EFTF expression and eye development in Xenopus laevis. Overexpression of ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 2 (E-NTPDase2)(8), an ectoenzyme that converts ATP to ADP(9), caused ectopic eye-like structures, with occasional complete duplication of the eye, and increased expression of Pax6, Rx1 and Six3. In contrast, down-regulation of endogenous E-NTPDase2 decreased Rx1 and Pax6 expression. E-NTPDase2 therefore acts upstream of these EFTFs. To test whether ADP (the product of E-NTPDase2) might act to trigger eye development through P2Y1 receptors, selective in Xenopus for ADP(10,11), we simultaneously knocked down expression of the genes encoding E-NTPDase2 and the P2Y1 receptor. This could prevent the expression of Rx1 and Pax6 and eye formation completely. We next measured ATP release(12-14) in the presumptive eye field, demonstrating a transient release of ATP at a time that could plausibly trigger (once converted to ADP) expression of the EFTFs.

Human retromer consists of two smaller complexes: the cargo recognition VPS26-VPS29-VPS35 heterotrimer and a membrane-targeting heterodimer or homodimer of SNX1 and/or SNX2 (ref. 13). Here we report the crystal structure of a VPS29-VPS35 subcomplex showing how the metallophosphoesterase-fold subunit VPS29 (refs 14, 15) acts as a scaffold for the carboxyterminal half of VPS35. VPS35 forms a horseshoe-shaped, right-handed, alpha-helical solenoid, the concave face of which completely covers the metal-binding site of VPS29, whereas the convex face exposes a series of hydrophobic interhelical grooves. Electron microscopy shows that the intact VPS26-VPS29-VPS35 complex is a stick-shaped, flexible structure, approximately 21 nm long. A hybrid structural model derived from crystal structures, electron microscopy, interaction studies and bioinformatics shows that the alpha-solenoid fold extends the full length of VPS35, and that VPS26 is bound at the opposite end from VPS29. This extended structure presents multiple binding sites for the SNX complex and receptor cargo, and appears capable of flexing to conform to curved vesicular membranes.","NIDDKD, Mol Biol Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; NICHHD, Cell Biol & Metab Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; NIAMSD, Struct Biol Lab, NIH, US Dept HHS, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; Univ Montpellier, CNRS, Ctr Rech Biochim Macromol, F-34293 Montpellier, France","Hurley, JH (reprint author), NIDDKD, Mol Biol Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",hurley@helix.nih.gov,"Hierro, Aitor/F-9998-2011; Rojas, Adriana/G-2403-2011; Kajava, Andrey/E-1107-2014","Hierro, Aitor/0000-0002-7721-1581; Rojas, Adriana/0000-0002-7358-3505; Kajava, Andrey/0000-0002-2342-6886; Bonifacino, Juan S./0000-0002-5673-6370",Intramural NIH HHS [Z01 DK036118-14],,,43,132,135,0,18,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,25-Oct,2007,449,7165,,,,,1063,U8,,10.1038/nature06216,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,223TK,WOS:000250395000055,17891154.0,No,,,11/20/17,james h.,hurley,na,na,na,na,na

One example of such modifications is histone ubiquitination, which occurs predominately on histone H2A and H2B. Although the recent identification of the ubiquitin ligase for histone H2A has revealed important roles for H2A ubiquitination in Hox gene silencing(4-6) as well as in X-chromosome inactivation(7,8), the enzyme(s) involved in H2A deubiquitination and the function of H2A deubiquitination are not known. Here we report the identification and functional characterization of the major deubiquitinase for histone H2A, Ubp-M (also called USP16). Ubp-M prefers nucleosomal substrates in vitro, and specifically deubiquitinates histone H2A but not H2B in vitro and in vivo. Notably, knockdown of Ubp-M in HeLa cells results in slow cell growth rates owing to defects in the mitotic phase of the cell cycle. Further studies reveal that H2A deubiquitination by Ubp-M is a prerequisite for subsequent phosphorylation of Ser 10 of H3 and chromosome segregation when cells enter mitosis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Ubp-M regulates Hox gene expression through H2A deubiquitination and that blocking the function of Ubp-M results in defective posterior development in Xenopus laevis. This study identifies the major deubiquitinase for histone H2A and demonstrates that H2A deubiquitination is critically involved in cell cycle progression and gene expression.","Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Biochem & Mol Genet, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Cell Biol, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Program Mol Biol, New York, NY 10021 USA","Wang, HB (reprint author), Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Biochem & Mol Genet, Kaul Human Genet Bldg 402A,720 S 20th St, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA.",hbwang@uab.edu,"Yang, Chunying /C-2888-2011","Tempst, Paul/0000-0002-6680-3987",,,,26,183,194,0,23,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,25-Oct,2007,449,7165,,,,,1068,U9,,10.1038/nature06256,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,223TK,WOS:000250395000056,17914355.0,No,,,11/20/17,hengbin,wang,na,na,na,na,na

In many instances, inactivation of genes critical for cancer development occurs by epigenetic silencing, often involving hypermethylation of CpG-rich promoter regions(2,3). It remains to be determined whether silencing occurs by random acquisition of epigenetic marks that confer a selective growth advantage or through a specific pathway initiated by an oncogene(4-6). Here we perform a genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screen in K-ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells and identify 28 genes required for Ras-mediated epigenetic silencing of the pro-apoptotic Fas gene. At least nine of these RESEs (Ras epigenetic silencing effectors), including the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1, are directly associated with specific regions of the Fas promoter in K-ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells but not in untransformed NIH3T3 cells. RNAi-mediated knockdown of any of the 28 RESEs results in failure to recruit DNMT1 to the Fas promoter, loss of Fas promoter hypermethylation, and derepression of Fas expression. Analysis of five other epigenetically repressed genes indicates that Ras directs the silencing of multiple unrelated genes through a largely common pathway. Last, we show that nine RESEs are required for anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenicity of K-ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells; these nine genes have not previously been implicated in transformation by Ras. Our results show that Ras-mediated epigenetic silencing occurs through a specific, complex, pathway involving components that are required for maintenance of a fully transformed phenotype.","Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Programs Gene Funct & Express & Mol Med, Worcester, MA 01605 USA","Green, MR (reprint author), Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, 364 Plantat St, Worcester, MA 01605 USA.",michael.green@umassmed.edu,"Wajapeyee, Narendra/F-3011-2012",,"Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM033977, R01 GM033977-23]",,,25,179,182,0,7,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,25-Oct,2007,449,7165,,,,,1073,U10,,10.1038/nature06251,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,223TK,WOS:000250395000057,17960246.0,No,,,11/20/17,michael r.,green,na,na,na,na,na

Crystal structures have provided a static picture of the apo (usually open) and holo usually closed) states. The general question arises as to whether the apo state exists as a single species in which the closed state is energetically inaccessible and interdomain rearrangement is induced by ligand or substrate binding, or whether the predominantly open form already coexists in rapid equilibrium with a minor closed species. The maltose-binding protein (MBP), a member of the bacterial periplasmic binding protein family(6), provides a model system for investigating this problem because it has been the subject of extensive studies by crystallography(7,8), NMR9-11 and other biophysical techniques(11-13). Here we show that although paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) data for the sugar-bound form are consistent with the crystal structure of holo MBP, the PRE data for the apo state are indicative of a rapidly exchanging mixture (ns to mu s regime) of a predominantly (similar to 95%) open form (represented by the apo crystal structure) and a minor (similar to 5%) partially closed species. Using ensemble simulated annealing refinement against the PRE data we are able to determine a [r(-6)] ensemble average structure of the minor apo species and show that it is distinct from the sugar-bound state.","NIDDKD, Chem Phys Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; NIH, Div Computat Biosci, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Clore, GM (reprint author), NIDDKD, Chem Phys Lab, NIH, Bldg 5, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",mariusc@intra.niddk.nih.gov,"Clore, G.

The map is estimated to capture untyped common variation with an average maximum r(2) of between 0.9 and 0.96 depending on population. We demonstrate that the current generation of commercial genome-wide genotyping products captures common Phase II SNPs with an average maximum r(2) of up to 0.8 in African and up to 0.95 in non-African populations, and that potential gains in power in association studies can be obtained through imputation. These data also reveal novel aspects of the structure of linkage disequilibrium. We show that 10-30% of pairs of individuals within a population share at least one region of extended genetic identity arising from recent ancestry and that up to 1% of all common variants are untaggable, primarily because they lie within recombination hotspots. We show that recombination rates vary systematically around genes and between genes of different function. Finally, we demonstrate increased differentiation at non-synonymous, compared to synonymous, SNPs, resulting from systematic differences in the strength or efficacy of natural selection between populations.","Univ Oxford, Dept Stat, Oxford OX1 3TG, England;

We propose that integrins are exploited by the gastric pathogen and type-1 carcinogen Helicobacter pylori for injection of the bacterial oncoprotein cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) into gastric epithelial cells. Virulent H. pylori express a type-IV secretion pilus that injects CagA into the host cell; CagA then becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated by Src family kinases. However, the identity of the host cell receptor involved in this process has remained unknown. Here we show that the H. pylori CagL protein is a specialized adhesin that is targeted to the pilus surface, where it binds to and activates integrin alpha(5)beta(1) receptor on gastric epithelial cells through an arginine-glycine-aspartate motif. This interaction triggers CagA delivery into target cells as well as activation of focal adhesion kinase and Src. Our findings provide insights into the role of integrins in H.-pylori-induced pathogenesis. CagL may be exploited as a new molecular tool for our further understanding of integrin signalling.","Otto Von Guericke Univ, Dept Med Microbiol, D-39120 Magdeburg, Germany; Otto Von Guericke Univ, Dept Immunol, D-39120 Magdeburg, Germany; Univ Bielefeld, Dept Chem Organ & Bioorgan Chem, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany; Helmholtz Ctr Infect Res, Dept Microbial Pathogenesis, D-38124 Braunschweig, Germany; Paul Ehrlich Inst, D-63225 Langen, Germany; Max Delbruck Ctr Mol Med, D-13125 Berlin, Germany; Max Planck Inst Dev Biol, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany","Backert, S (reprint author), Otto Von Guericke Univ, Dept Med Microbiol, Leipziger Str 44, D-39120 Magdeburg, Germany.",Steffen.Backert@med.ovgu.de,"Sewald, Norbert/A-2541-2012; Wessler, Silja/C-6309-2015","Sewald, Norbert/0000-0002-0309-2655; Wessler, Silja/0000-0001-7011-6162; Kwok, Terry/0000-0002-5905-3233",,,,24,317,327,2,17,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,18-Oct,2007,449,7164,,,,,862,U4,,10.1038/nature06187,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,221LY,WOS:000250230600037,17943123.0,No,,,11/20/17,steffen,backert,male,0.98,120,na,na

However, the catalytic mechanism of peptide-bond formation by LF-transferase remained obscure. Here we determine the structures of complexes of LF-transferase and phenylalanyl adenosine, with and without a short peptide bearing an N-terminal Arg. Combining the two separate structures into one structure as well as mutation studies reveal the mechanism for peptide-bond formation by LF-transferase. The electron relay from Asp 186 to Gln 188 helps Gln 188 to attract a proton from the alpha-amino group of the N-terminal Arg of the acceptor peptide. This generates the attacking nucleophile for the carbonyl carbon of the aminoacyl bond of the aminoacyl-tRNA, thus facilitating peptide-bond formation. The protein-based mechanism for peptide-bond formation by LF-transferase is similar to the reverse reaction of the acylation step observed in the peptide hydrolysis reaction by serine proteases.","Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Inst Biol Resources & Funct, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058566, Japan; Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Dept Med Genome Sci, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778562, Japan","Tomita, K (reprint author), Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Inst Biol Resources & Funct, 1-1-1 Higashi, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058566, Japan.",kozo-tomita@aist.go.jp,"Toh, Yukimatsu/B-6549-2013; Tomita, Kozo/J-5746-2013; Shimizu, Yoshihiro/A-6472-2016",,,,,35,55,56,0,14,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,18-Oct,2007,449,7164,,,,,867,U5,,10.1038/nature06167,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,221LY,WOS:000250230600038,17891155.0,No,,,11/20/17,kozo,tomita,female,1,1,rwcd1tIAAAAJ,1358

Models of stellar evolution have difficulty producing black holes in close binaries with masses more than ten times that of the Sun (> 10M(circle dot); ref. 4), which is consistent with the fact that the most massive stellar black holes known so far(2,3) all have masses within one standard deviation of 10M(circle dot). Here we report a mass of (15.65 +/- 1.45) M-circle dot for the black hole in the recently discovered system M 33 X-7, which is located in the nearby galaxy Messier 33 (M 33) and is the only known black hole that is in an eclipsing binary(5). To produce such a massive black hole, the progenitor star must have retained much of its outer envelope until after helium fusion in the core was completed(4). On the other hand, in order for the black hole to be in its present 3.45-day orbit about its (70.0 +/- 6.9) M-circle dot companion, there must have been a 'common envelope' phase of evolution in which a significant amount of mass was lost from the system(6). We find that the common envelope phase could not have occurred in M 33 X-7 unless the amount of mass lost from the progenitor during its evolution was an order of magnitude less than what is usually assumed in evolutionary models of massive stars(7-9).","San Diego State Univ, Dept Astron, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Yale Univ, Dept Astron, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; Natl Opt Astron Observ, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA; Max Planck Inst Extraterr Phys, D-85741 Garching, Germany; MIT, Kavli Inst Astrophys & Space Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Tel Aviv Univ, Wise Observ, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel","Orosz, JA (reprint author), San Diego State Univ, Dept Astron, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",orosz@sciences.sdsu.edu,,"Hartman, Joel/0000-0001-8732-6166; Macri, Lucas/0000-0002-1775-4859; Narayan, Ramesh/0000-0002-1919-2730",,,,25,116,117,0,1,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,18-Oct,2007,449,7164,,,,,872,875,,10.1038/nature06218,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,221LY,WOS:000250230600039,17943124.0,No,,,11/20/17,tsevi,mazeh,na,na,na,na,na

Disorder is expected to enhance the electrical resistance of a system, whereas superconductivity is associated with a zero-resistance state. Although superconductivity has been predicted to persist even in the presence of disorder(1), experiments performed on thin films have demonstrated a transition from a superconducting to an insulating state with increasing disorder or magnetic field(2). The nature of this transition is still under debate, and the subject has become even more relevant with the realization that high-transition-temperature (high-T-c) superconductors are intrinsically disordered(3-5). Here we present numerical simulations of the superconductor-insulator transition in two-dimensional disordered superconductors, starting from a microscopic description that includes thermal phase fluctuations. We demonstrate explicitly that disorder leads to the formation of islands where the superconducting order is high. For weak disorder, or high electron density, increasing the magnetic field results in the eventual vanishing of the amplitude of the superconducting order parameter, thereby forming an insulating state. On the other hand, at lower electron densities or higher disorder, increasing the magnetic field suppresses the correlations between the phases of the superconducting order parameter in different islands, giving rise to a different type of superconductor-insulator transition. One of the important predictions of this work is that in the regime of high disorder, there are still superconducting islands in the sample, even on the insulating side of the transition. This result, which is consistent with experiments(6,7), explains the recently observed huge magneto-resistance peak in disordered thin films(8-10) and may be relevant to the observation of 'the pseudo-gap phenomenon' in underdoped high-T-c superconductors(11,12).","Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Phys, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Ilse Katz Ctr Meso & Nano Scale Sci & Technol, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel","Meir, Y (reprint author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Phys, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",ymeir@bgu.ac.il,"Dubi, Yonatan/G-5304-2013",,,,,30,187,190,7,55,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,18-Oct,2007,449,7164,,,,,876,880,,10.1038/nature06180,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,221LY,WOS:000250230600040,17943125.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,yshai,avishai,na,na,na,na,na

In memories of this sort, storing a data bit means increasing the size of one polar region at the expense of another, and hence the movement of a domain wall separating these regions. Experimental measurements of domain growth rates in the well-established ferroelectrics PbTiO(3) and BaTiO(3) have been performed, but the development of new materials has been hampered by a lack of microscopic understanding of how domain walls move(2-11). Despite some success in interpreting domain-wall motion in terms of classical nucleation and growth models(12-16), these models were formulated without insight from first-principles-based calculations, and they portray a picture of a large, triangular nucleus that leads to unrealistically large depolarization and nucleation energies(5). Here we use atomistic molecular dynamics and coarse-grained Monte Carlo simulations to analyse these processes, and demonstrate that the prevailing models are incorrect. Our multi-scale simulations reproduce experimental domain growth rates in PbTiO(3) and reveal small, square critical nuclei with a diffuse interface. A simple analytic model is also proposed, relating bulk polarization and gradient energies to wall nucleation and growth, and thus rationalizing all experimental rate measurements in PbTiO(3) and BaTiO(3).","Univ Penn, Dept Chem, Makineni Theoret Labs, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; Univ Penn, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Rappe, AM (reprint author), Univ Penn, Dept Chem, Makineni Theoret Labs, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",rappe@sas.upenn.edu,"Shin, Young-Han/G-7562-2015",,,,,26,181,185,16,174,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,18-Oct,2007,449,7164,,,,,881,U7,,10.1038/nature06165,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,221LY,WOS:000250230600041,17922002.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,andrew m.,rappe,na,na,na,na,na

The use of nanostructures or nanostructured materials represents a general approach to reduce both cost and size and to improve efficiency in photovoltaics(1-9). Nanoparticles, nanorods and nanowires have been used to improve charge collection efficiency in polymer-blend(4) and dye-sensitized solar cells(5,6), to demonstrate carrier multiplication(7), and to enable low-temperature processing of photovoltaic devices(3-6). Moreover, recent theoretical studies have indicated that coaxial nanowire structures could improve carrier collection and overall efficiency with respect to single-crystal bulk semiconductors of the same materials(8,9). However, solar cells based on hybrid nanoarchitectures suffer from relatively low efficiencies and poor stabilities(1). In addition, previous studies have not yet addressed their use as photovoltaic power elements in nanoelectronics. Here we report the realization of p-type/intrinsic/n-type (p-i-n) coaxial silicon nanowire solar cells. Under one solar equivalent (1-sun) illumination, the p-i-n silicon nanowire elements yield a maximum power output of up to 200 pW per nanowire device and an apparent energy conversion efficiency of up to 3.4 per cent, with stable and improved efficiencies achievable at high-flux illuminations. Furthermore, we show that individual and interconnected silicon nanowire photovoltaic elements can serve as robust power sources to drive functional nanoelectronic sensors and logic gates. These coaxial silicon nanowire photovoltaic elements provide a new nanoscale test bed for studies of photoinduced energy/charge transport and artificial photosynthesis(10), and might find general usage as elements for powering ultralow-power electronics(11) and diverse nanosystems(12,13).","Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Biol Chem, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Lieber, CM (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Biol Chem, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",cml@cmliris.harvard.edu,"Zheng, Xiaolin/F-5231-2011","Kempa, Thomas/0000-0002-1672-8325",,,,30,2039,2061,65,1102,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,18-Oct,2007,449,7164,,,,,885,U8,,10.1038/nature06181,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,221LY,WOS:000250230600042,17943126.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,charles m.,lieber,na,na,na,na,na

Many recent explanations call on greater carbon storage in a poorly ventilated deep ocean during glacial periods(1-5), but direct evidence regarding the ventilation and respired carbon content of the glacial deep ocean is sparse and often equivocal(6). Here we present sedimentary geochemical records from sites spanning the deep subarctic Pacific that-together with previously published results(7)-show that a poorly ventilated water mass containing a high concentration of respired carbon dioxide occupied the North Pacific abyss during the Last Glacial Maximum. Despite an inferred increase in deep Southern Ocean ventilation during the first step of the deglaciation (18,000-15,000 years ago)(4,8), we find no evidence for improved ventilation in the abyssal subarctic Pacific until a rapid transition similar to 14,600 years ago: this change was accompanied by an acceleration of export production from the surface waters above but only a small increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration(8). We speculate that these changes were mechanistically linked to a roughly coeval increase in deep water formation in the North Atlantic(9-11), which flushed respired carbon dioxide from northern abyssal waters, but also increased the supply of nutrients to the upper ocean, leading to greater carbon dioxide sequestration at mid-depths and stalling the rise of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. Our findings are qualitatively consistent with hypotheses invoking a deglacial flushing of respired carbon dioxide from an isolated, deep ocean reservoir(1-5,12), but suggest that the reservoir may have been released in stages, as vigorous deep water ventilation switched between North Atlantic and Southern Ocean source regions.","Univ British Columbia, Dept Earth & Ocean Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; Univ Victoria, Sch Earth & Ocean Sci, Victoria, BC V8W 3P6, Canada; Princeton Univ, Dept Geosci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; ETH, Inst Geol, Dept Earth Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ocean Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA","Galbraith, ED (reprint author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Earth & Ocean Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",egalbrai@princeton.edu,"Sigman, Daniel/A-2649-2008; Galbraith, Eric/F-9469-2014; Jaccard, Samuel/G-3447-2014","Sigman, Daniel/0000-0002-7923-1973; Galbraith, Eric/0000-0003-4476-4232; Jaccard, Samuel/0000-0002-5793-0896",,,,39,116,116,1,30,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,18-Oct,2007,449,7164,,,,,890,U9,,10.1038/nature06227,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,221LY,WOS:000250230600043,17943127.0,No,,,11/20/17,roger,francois,male,1,1220,wa5soqQAAAAJ,3429

Plate reconstructions based on palaeomagnetic data suggest that the Indian plate attained a very high speed (18-20 cm yr(-1) during the late Cretaceous period) subsequent to its breakup from Gondwanaland, and then slowed to similar to 5 cm yr(-1) after the continental collision with Asia similar to 50 Myr ago(1,2). The Australian and African plates moved comparatively less distance and at much lower speeds of 2-4 cm yr(-1) (refs 3-5). Antarctica remained almost stationary. This mobility makes India unique among the fragments of Gondwanaland. Here we propose that when the fragments of Gondwanaland were separated by the plume, the penetration of their lithospheric roots into the asthenosphere were important in determining their speed. We estimated the thickness of the lithospheric plates of the different fragments of Gondwanaland around the Indian Ocean by using the shear-wave receiver function technique. We found that the fragment of Gondwanaland with clearly the thinnest lithosphere is India. The lithospheric roots in South Africa, Australia and Antarctica are between 180 and 300 km deep, whereas the Indian lithosphere extends only about 100 km deep. We infer that the plume that partitioned Gondwanaland may have also melted the lower half of the Indian lithosphere, thus permitting faster motion due to ridge push or slab pull.","Geoforschungszentrum Potsdam, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; Natl Geophys Res Inst, Hyderabad 500007, Andhra Pradesh, India; Free Univ Berlin, D-12249 Berlin, Germany","Kind, R (reprint author), Geoforschungszentrum Potsdam, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany.",kind@gfz-potsdam.de,"Yuan, Xiaohui/G-5149-2010; GEOFON, GlobalSeismicNetwork/E-4273-2012","Yuan, Xiaohui/0000-0002-2891-1354; ",,,,33,180,190,0,34,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,18-Oct,2007,449,7164,,,,,894,897,,10.1038/nature06214,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,221LY,WOS:000250230600044,17943128.0,No,,,11/20/17,r. k.,chadha,na,na,na,na,na

They are usually assumed to be of thermochemical origin(1), but biological formation of ethane and propane has been also observed(2). Microbial utilization of short-chain hydrocarbons has been shown in some aerobic species(3,4) but not in anaerobic species of bacteria. On the other hand, anaerobic utilization of short-chain hydrocarbons would in principle be expected because various anaerobic bacteria grow with higher homologues (>= C-6)(5). Indeed, chemical analyses of hydrocarbon-rich habitats with limited or no access of oxygen indicated in situ biodegradation of short-chain hydrocarbons(6-10). Here we report the enrichment of sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) with such capacity from marine hydrocarbon seep areas. Propane or n-butane as the sole growth substrate led to sediment-free sulphate-reducing enrichment cultures growing at 12, 28 or 60 degrees C. With ethane, a slower enrichment with residual sediment was obtained at 12 degrees C. Isolation experiments resulted in a mesophilic pure culture (strain BuS5) that used only propane and n-butane (methane, isobutane, alcohols or carboxylic acids did not support growth). Complete hydrocarbon oxidation to CO2 and the preferential oxidation of C-12-enriched alkanes were observed with strain BuS5 and other cultures. Metabolites of propane included iso- and n-propylsuccinate, indicating a subterminal as well as an unprecedented terminal alkane activation with involvement of fumarate. According to 16S ribosomal RNA analyses, strain BuS5 affiliates with Desulfosarcina/Desulfococcus, a cluster of widespread marine SRB. An enrichment culture with propane growing at 60 degrees C was dominated by Desulfotomaculum-like SRB. Our results suggest that diverse SRB are able to thrive in seep areas and gas reservoirs on propane and butane, thus altering the gas composition and contributing to sulphide production.","Max Planck Inst Marine Microbiol, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Biol, Woods Hole, MA 02536 USA; Geoforschungszentrum Potsdam, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; Univ Hamburg, Inst Biogeochem & Marine Chem, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; Rhein Westfal TH Aachen Univ, Inst Organ Chem, D-52056 Aachen, Germany; Univ Georgia, Dept Marine Sci, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Widdel, F (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Marine Microbiol, Celsiusstr 1, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.",fwiddel@mpi-bremen.de,"Kniemeyer, Olaf/K-1253-2013; Bolm, Carsten/G-2247-2014","Kniemeyer, Olaf/0000-0002-9493-6402; Bolm, Carsten/0000-0001-9415-9917; Sievert, Stefan/0000-0002-9541-2707; Musat, Florin/0000-0002-4240-3495; Joye, Samantha/0000-0003-1610-451X",,,,37,160,165,11,108,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,18-Oct,2007,449,7164,,,,,898,U10,,10.1038/nature06200,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,221LY,WOS:000250230600045,17882164.0,No,,,11/20/17,friedrich,widdel,male,1,18,na,na

After their initial appearance, such traits increased in frequency and the extent to which they are expressed until they disappeared shortly after 30,000 years ago. However, because most fossil hominid remains are fragmentary, it can be difficult or impossible to determine unambiguously whether a fossil is of Neanderthal origin. This limits the ability to determine when and where Neanderthals lived. To determine how far to the east Neanderthals ranged, we determined mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences from hominid remains found in Uzbekistan and in the Altai region of southern Siberia. Here we show that the DNA sequences from these fossils fall within the European Neanderthal mtDNA variation. Thus, the geographic range of Neanderthals is likely to have extended at least 2,000 km further to the east than commonly assumed.","Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Anthropol, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; Univ Lyon, Inst Genom Fonct Lyon,CNRS,INRA, Inst Federat Biosci Gerland Lyon Sud, Ecole Normale Super Lyon, F-69364 Lyon 07, France; McGill Univ, Montreal, PQ H3A 1A4, Canada; Genome Quebec Innovat Ctr, Montreal, PQ H3A 1A4, Canada; Univ Vienna, Fac Life Sci, Dept Anthropol, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; Russian Acad Sci, Inst Archaeol & Ethnog, Paleolith Dept, Siberian Branch, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia","Paabo, S (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Anthropol, Deutsch Pl 6, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.",paabo@eva.mpg.de,"Richards, Michael/A-9374-2008; Viola, Bence/B-7390-2011; Orlando, Ludovic/A-8932-2013; Krause, Johannes/E-6640-2015; Richards, Michael/O-3717-2016; Derevianko, Anatoly/Q-5975-2016","Richards, Michael/0000-0001-5274-8887; Orlando, Ludovic/0000-0003-3936-1850; Krause, Johannes/0000-0001-5475-4690; Richards, Michael/0000-0001-5274-8887; Derevianko, Anatoly/0000-0003-1156-8331; Viola, Bence/0000-0001-8052-707X",,,,30,160,169,1,76,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,18-Oct,2007,449,7164,,,,,902,904,,10.1038/nature06193,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,221LY,WOS:000250230600046,17914357.0,No,,,11/20/17,svante,paeaebo,male,1,5,na,na

From 195-130 kyr ago, the world was in a fluctuating but predominantly glacial stage ( marine isotope stage MIS6)(5); much of Africa was cooler and drier, and dated archaeological sites are rare(6,7). Here we show that by similar to 164 kyr ago (+/-12 kyr) at Pinnacle Point (on the south coast of South Africa) humans expanded their diet to include marine resources, perhaps as a response to these harsh environmental conditions. The earliest previous evidence for human use of marine resources and coastal habitats was dated to 125 kyr ago(8,9). Coincident with this diet and habitat expansion is an early use and modification of pigment, probably for symbolic behaviour, as well as the production of bladelet stone tool technology, previously dated to post-70 kyr ago(10-12). Shellfish may have been crucial to the survival of these early humans as they expanded their home ranges to include coastlines and followed the shifting position of the coast when sea level fluctuated over the length of MIS6.","Arizona State Univ, Inst Human Origins, POB 872402, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; Arizona State Univ, Sch Human Evolut & Social Change, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; Geol Survey Israel, IL-95501 Jerusalem, Israel; Univ Florida, Dept Anthropol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; Boston Univ, Dept Archaeol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; Univ New S Wales, Sch Med Sci, Human Origins Grp, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; Univ Wollongong, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; Univ Cape Town, Dept Archaeol, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa; Minist Culture, Ephoreia Palaeoanthropol Speleol, Athens 11636, Greece; Univ Washington, Dept Anthropol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Iziko S African Museum, Archaeol Div, ZA-8000 Cape Town, South Africa","Marean, CW (reprint author), Arizona State Univ, Inst Human Origins, POB 872402, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",curtis.marean@asu.edu,"Jacobs, Zenobia/B-2721-2012; Karkanas, Panagiotis/F-7762-2011; Jerardino, Antonieta/K-3659-2014","Jacobs, Zenobia/0000-0001-5424-5837; Karkanas, Panagiotis/0000-0002-7156-671X; Jerardino, Antonieta/0000-0002-0078-7718; Herries, Andy/0000-0002-2905-2002",,,,32,395,408,12,84,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,18-Oct,2007,449,7164,,,,,905,+,,10.1038/nature06204,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,221LY,WOS:000250230600047,17943129.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,hope m.,williams,na,na,na,na,na

In some taxa the master sex-determining gene moves frequently between chromosomes, whereas in other taxa different genes have been recruited to determine the sex of the zygotes. There is a well developed theory for the origin of stable and highly dimorphic sex chromosomes seen in groups such as the eutherian mammals(3). In contrast, the evolutionary lability of genetic sex determination in other groups remains largely unexplained(1). In this theoretical study, we show that an autosomal gene under sexually antagonistic selection can cause the spread of a new sex-determining gene linked to it. The mechanism can account for the origin of new sex-determining loci, the transposition of an ancestral sex-determining gene to an autosome, and the maintenance of multiple sex-determining factors in species that lack heteromorphic sex chromosomes.","Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA; Univ Texas, Sect Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA","van Doorn, GS (reprint author), Santa Fe Inst, 1399 Hyde Pk Rd, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA.",vandoorn@santafe.edu,"van Doorn, G.

In a complementary analysis, we identify 26 non-synonymous, coding, single nucleotide polymorphisms showing regional evidence of positive selection. Examination of these candidates highlights three cases in which two genes in a common biological process have apparently undergone positive selection in the same population: LARGE and DMD, both related to infection by the Lassa virus(3), in West Africa; SLC24A5 and SLC45A2, both involved in skin pigmentation(4,5), in Europe; and EDAR and EDA2R, both involved in development of hair follicles(6), in Asia.","MIT, Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Human Genet Res, Boston, MA 02114 USA; Harvard Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Sabeti, PC (reprint author), MIT, Broad Inst, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",pardis@broad.mit.edu,"; Kwok, Pui-Yan/F-7725-2014; Gaudet, Rachelle/I-4133-2014; Tsunoda, Tatsuhiko/K-2061-2014; Myers, Simon/A-6792-2015; Waye _____, Mary Miu Yee /A-9674-2008; Tsui, Stephen Kwok-Wing/E-4385-2015; Tanaka, Toshihiro/J-9310-2014; Smith, Albert/K-5150-2015; McCarroll, Steven/A-8433-2009; Song, You-qiang/C-4401-2009; Tam, Paul/C-4405-2009; Jin, Li/C-1468-2009; Abecasis, Goncalo/B-7840-2010; Altshuler, David/A-4476-2009; Schaffner, Stephen/D-1189-2011; Qin, Zhaohui/E-8196-2011; _, _/C-8514-2011; Deloukas, Panos/B-2922-2013; Varilly, Patrick/C-8118-2013; Evans, David/H-6325-2013; de Bakker, Paul/B-8730-2009","Evans, David/0000-0003-0663-4621; He, Yungang/0000-0002-2931-2871; Phillips, Michael/0000-0003-1040-9080; Thorisson, Gudmundur/0000-0001-5635-1860; Richter, Daniel/0000-0002-9238-5571; Hunt, Sarah/0000-0002-8350-1235; Johnson, Todd Andrew/0000-0003-3377-6692; Xue, Hong/0000-0002-8133-9828; Hinds, David/0000-0002-4911-803X; Fosker, Christine/0000-0002-3799-9474; Belmont, John/0000-0001-7409-3578; Cotsapas, Chris/0000-0002-7772-5910; Stranger, Barbara/0000-0001-9021-7331; Adebamowo, Clement/0000-0002-6571-2880; Abecasis, Goncalo/0000-0003-1509-1825; Kwok, Pui-Yan/0000-0002-5087-3059; Gaudet, Rachelle/0000-0002-9177-054X; Myers, Simon/0000-0002-2585-9626; Waye _____, Mary Miu Yee /0000-0002-2582-4917; Tsui, Stephen Kwok-Wing/0000-0003-0686-4259; Tanaka, Toshihiro/0000-0001-6201-9784; Smith, Albert/0000-0003-1942-5845; Clayton, Ellen/0000-0002-0308-4110; Maller, Julian/0000-0002-1565-9559; Jin, Li/0000-0002-4546-2415; Altshuler, David/0000-0002-7250-4107; Qin, Zhaohui/0000-0002-1583-146X; Deloukas, Panos/0000-0001-9251-070X; Varilly, Patrick/0000-0003-4619-8174; de Bakker, Paul/0000-0001-7735-7858","Wellcome Trust [077008, 077011, 077046, 081682]",,,34,759,789,10,185,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,18-Oct,2007,449,7164,,,,,913,U12,,10.1038/nature06250,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,221LY,WOS:000250230600049,17943131.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,eric s.,lander,na,na,na,na,na

Here we show that interferon beta (IFN beta) rapidly modulates the expression of numerous cellular miRNAs, and that eight of these IFN beta-induced miRNAs have sequence-predicted targets within the hepatitis C virus (HCV) genomic RNA. The introduction of synthetic miRNA-mimics corresponding to these IFN beta-induced miRNAs reproduces the antiviral effects of IFN beta on HCV replication and infection, whereas neutralization of these antiviral miRNAs with anti-miRNAs reduces the antiviral effects of IFN beta against HCV. In addition, we demonstrate that IFN beta treatment leads to a significant reduction in the expression of the liver-specific miR-122, an miRNA that has been previously shown to be essential for HCV replication(2). Therefore, our findings strongly support the notion that mammalian organisms too, through the interferon system, use cellular miRNAs to combat viral infections.","Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Mol Biol, Div Biol Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, Moores Canc Ctr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Scripps Res Inst, Div Expt Pathol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; Ohio State Univ, Dept Mol Virol Immunol & Med Genet, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","David, M (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Mol Biol, Div Biol Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",midavid@ucsd.edu,"Volinia, Stefano/A-3029-2010; Chisari, Francis/A-3086-2008","Volinia, Stefano/0000-0003-0910-3893; Chisari, Francis/0000-0002-4832-1044","NIDDK NIH HHS [R01 DK078857, R01 DK078857-01, R01 DK078857-02]",,,26,574,621,3,60,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,18-Oct,2007,449,7164,,,,,919,U13,,10.1038/nature06205,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,221LY,WOS:000250230600050,17943132.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,michael,david,na,na,na,na,na

Eps15 homology (EH)-domain-containing proteins (EHDs/RME-1/pincher) comprise a less-well-characterized class of highly conserved eukaryotic ATPases implicated in clathrin-independent endocytosis(2), and recycling from endosomes(3,4). Here we show that EHDs share many common features with the dynamin superfamily, such as a low affinity for nucleotides, the ability to tubulate liposomes in vitro, oligomerization around lipid tubules in ring-like structures and stimulated nucleotide hydrolysis in response to lipid binding. We present the structure of EHD2, bound to a non-hydrolysable ATP analogue, and provide evidence consistent with a role for EHDs in nucleotide-dependent membrane remodelling in vivo. The nucleotide-binding domain is involved in dimerization, which creates a highly curved membrane-binding region in the dimer. Oligomerization of dimers occurs on another interface of the nucleotide-binding domain, and this allows us to model the EHD oligomer.

Methylation at lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4) is found at the 5' end of active genes and contributes to transcriptional activation by recruiting chromatin-remodelling enzymes(4,5). An adjacent arginine residue (H3R2) is also known to be asymmetrically dimethylated (H3R2me2a) in mammalian cells(6), but its location within genes and its function in transcription are unknown. Here we show that H3R2 is also methylated in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), and by using an antibody specific for H3R2me2a in a chromatin immunoprecipitation-on-chip analysis we determine the distribution of this modification on the entire yeast genome. We find that H3R2me2a is enriched throughout all heterochromatic loci and inactive euchromatic genes and is present at the 3' end of moderately transcribed genes. In all cases the pattern of H3R2 methylation is mutually exclusive with the trimethyl form of H3K4 (H3K4me3). We show that methylation at H3R2 abrogates the trimethylation of H3K4 by the Set1 methyltransferase. The specific effect on H3K4me3 results from the occlusion of Spp1, a Set1 methyltransferase subunit necessary for trimethylation. Thus, the inability of Spp1 to recognize H3 methylated at R2 prevents Set1 from trimethylating H3K4. These results provide the first mechanistic insight into the function of arginine methylation on chromatin.","Gurdon Inst, Cambridge CB2 1QN, England; Univ Cambridge, Dept Pathol, Cambridge CB2 1QN, England; Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Cambridge CB10 1HH, England; NimbleGen Syst Inc, Madison, WI 53711 USA; Max Planck Inst Biochem, Dept Proteom & Signal Transduct, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany","Kouzarides, T (reprint author), Gurdon Inst, Tennis Court Rd, Cambridge CB2 1QN, England.",t.kouzarides@gurdon.cam.ac.uk,"; Bahler, Jurg/B-4572-2009; Vermeulen, Michiel/C-8883-2013; Mann, Matthias/A-3454-2013","Vermeulen, Michiel/0000-0003-0836-6894; Bahler, Jurg/0000-0003-4036-1532; Mann, Matthias/0000-0003-1292-4799","Cancer Research UK [A6517]; Wellcome Trust [077118, 092096]",,,29,198,199,1,7,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,18-Oct,2007,449,7164,,,,,928,U17,,10.1038/nature06160,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,221LY,WOS:000250230600052,17898715.0,No,,,11/20/17,tony,kouzarides,male,1,3071,na,na

Post-translational modifications of histones (or 'marks') are key in defining these functional states, particularly in promoter regions(1,2). Mutual regulatory interactions between these marks-and the enzymes that catalyse them-contribute to the shaping of this epigenetic landscape, in a manner that remains to be fully elucidated(1,2). We previously observed that asymmetric di-methylation of histone H3 arginine 2 (H3R2me2a) counter-correlates with di- and tri-methylation of H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me2, H3K4me3) on human promoters(3). Here we show that the arginine methyltransferase PRMT6 catalyses H3R2 di- methylation in vitro and controls global levels of H3R2me2a in vivo. H3R2 methylation by PRMT6 was prevented by the presence of H3K4me3 on the H3 tail. Conversely, the H3R2me2a mark prevented methylation of H3K4 as well as binding to the H3 tail by an ASH2/WDR5/MLL-family methyltransferase complex(4-7). Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that H3R2me2a was distributed within the body and at the 39 end of human genes, regardless of their transcriptional state, whereas it was selectively and locally depleted from active promoters, coincident with the presence of H3K4me3. Hence, the mutual antagonism between H3R2 and H3K4 methylation, together with the association of MLL-family complexes with the basal transcription machinery(8), may contribute to the localized patterns of H3K4 tri-methylation characteristic of transcriptionally poised or active promoters in mammalian genomes(1-3,9,10).","European Inst Oncol, Dept Expt Oncol, I-20139 Milan, Italy; RWTH Aachen Univ Hosp, Inst Biochem, Div Biochem & Mol Biol, D-52074 Aachen, Germany","Amati, B (reprint author), European Inst Oncol, Dept Expt Oncol, IFOM IEO Campus, I-20139 Milan, Italy.",bruno.amati@ifom-ieo-campus.it,"guccione, ernesto/G-9874-2011","Kleine, Henning/0000-0003-2559-6608; Luscher, Bernhard/0000-0002-9622-8709",,,,33,244,251,3,24,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,18-Oct,2007,449,7164,,,,,933,U18,,10.1038/nature06166,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,221LY,WOS:000250230600053,17898714.0,No,,,11/20/17,bruno,amati,male,1,926,na,na

These paralogues arose from a single bifunctional ancestral gene as is still present in Kluyveromyces lactis. To determine which evolutionary processes shaped the evolution of the two paralogues, here we assess the effects of precise replacement of coding and non-coding sequences on organismal fitness. We suggest that duplication of the ancestral bifunctional gene allowed for the resolution of an adaptive conflict between the transcriptional regulation of the two gene functions. After duplication, previously disfavoured binding site configurations evolved that divided the regulation of the ancestral gene into two specialized genes, one of which ultimately became one of the most tightly regulated genes in the genome.","Univ Wisconsin, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Genet Lab, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Hittinger, CT (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Genet Lab, 1525 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",cthittinger@wustl.edu,"Phelps, Steve/H-2263-2011",,,,,50,210,218,0,33,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-Oct,2007,449,7163,,,,,677,U1,,10.1038/nature06151,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,218VV,WOS:000250045000034,17928853.0,No,,,11/20/17,sean b.,carroll,na,na,na,na,na

Although there is emerging evidence that some microRNAs can function as oncogenes or tumour suppressors, the role of microRNAs in mediating cancer metastasis remains unexplored. Here we show, using a combination of mouse and human cells, that microRNA-10b (miR-10b) is highly expressed in metastatic breast cancer cells and positively regulates cell migration and invasion. Overexpression of miR-10b in otherwise non-metastatic breast tumours initiates robust invasion and metastasis. Expression of miR-10b is induced by the transcription factor Twist, which binds directly to the putative promoter of mir-10b (MIRN10B). The miR-10b induced by Twist proceeds to inhibit translation of the messenger RNA encoding homeobox D10, resulting in increased expression of a well-characterized pro-metastatic gene, RHOC. Significantly, the level of miR-10b expression in primary breast carcinomas correlates with clinical progression. These findings suggest the workings of an undescribed regulatory pathway, in which a pleiotropic transcription factor induces expression of a specific microRNA, which suppresses its direct target and in turn activates another pro-metastatic gene, leading to tumour cell invasion and metastasis.","MIT, Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10021 USA","Weinberg, RA (reprint author), MIT, Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",weinberg@wi.mit.edu,,,,,,48,1555,1707,5,173,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-Oct,2007,449,7163,,,,,682,U2,,10.1038/nature06174,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,218VV,WOS:000250045000035,17898713.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,robert a.,weinberg,na,na,na,na,na

Histone H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) has been linked to polycomb-group-protein-mediated suppression of Hox genes and animal body patterning, X-chromosome inactivation and possibly maintenance of embryonic stem cell (ESC) identity. An imbalance of H3K27 methylation owing to overexpression of the methylase EZH2 has been implicated in metastatic prostate and aggressive breast cancers. Here we show that the JmjC-domain-containing related proteins UTX and JMJD3 catalyse demethylation of H3K27me3/2. UTX is enriched around the transcription start sites of many HOX genes in primary human fibroblasts, in which HOX genes are differentially expressed, but is selectively excluded from the HOX loci in ESCs, in which HOX genes are largely silent. Consistently, RNA interference inhibition of UTX led to increased H3K27me3 levels at some HOX gene promoters. Importantly, morpholino oligonucleotide inhibition of a zebrafish UTX homologue resulted in mis-regulation of hox genes and a striking posterior developmental defect, which was partially rescued by wild-type, but not by catalytically inactive, human UTX. Taken together, these findings identify a small family of H3K27 demethylases with important, evolutionarily conserved roles in H3K27 methylation regulation and in animal anterior-posterior development.","Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Canc Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Dermatol, Program Epithelial Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Mol Cell Biol, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel","Shi, Y (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, 77 Ave Louis Pasteur, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",yshi@hms.harvard.edu,,,,,,40,401,422,1,43,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-Oct,2007,449,7163,,,,,689,U3,,10.1038/nature06192,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,218VV,WOS:000250045000036,17851529.0,No,,,11/20/17,yang,shi,male,0.65,93,na,na

Here we use Cassini images taken from a variety of viewing directions over two years to triangulate the source locations for the most prominent jets, and compare these with the infrared hotspot locations and the predictions from a recent model of tidally induced shear heating within the fractures(3). We find that the jets emanate from the four tiger stripes, with the strongest sources on Baghdad and Damascus. All the jets from each fracture seem to lie in the same nearly vertical plane. There is a strong spatial coincidence between our geographical sources and the locations of increased temperature revealed by the infrared experiment. Comparison with the shear heating model shows broad agreement; the exception is the prediction that Baghdad is the least active lineament, whereas we find it to be the most active.

However, laser operation is an inherently nonlinear process. Knowledge about the dynamic behaviour of lasers is thus of great importance for detailed understanding of laser operation and for improvement in performance for applications. Of particular interest is the time domain within the coherence time of the optical transition. This time is determined by the oscillation period of the laser radiation and thus is very short. Rigorous quantum mechanical models(1,2) predict interesting effects like quantum beats, lasing without inversion, and photon echo processes. As these models are based on quantum coherence and interference, knowledge of the phase within the optical cycle is of particular interest. Laser radiation has so far been measured using intensity detectors, which are sensitive to the square of the electric field. Therefore information about the sign and phase of the laser radiation is lost. Here we use an electro-optic detection scheme to measure the amplitude and phase of stimulated radiation, and correlate this radiation directly with an input probing pulse. We have applied this technique to semiconductor quantum cascade lasers, which are coherent sources operating at frequencies between the optical (> 100 THz) and electronic (< 0.5 THz) ranges(3).

Three forms of ferroic order are widely known: ferromagnetism, a spontaneous magnetization; ferroelectricity, a spontaneous polarization; and ferroelasticity, a spontaneous strain. It is currently debated whether to include an ordered arrangement of magnetic vortices as a fourth form of ferroic order, termed ferrotoroidicity. Although there are reasons to expect this form of order from the point of view of thermodynamics(1), a crucial hallmark of the ferroic state-that is, ferrotoroidic domains has not hitherto been observed. Here ferrotoroidic domains are spatially resolved by optical second harmonic generation in LiCoPO4, where they coexist with independent antiferromagnetic domains.

Placing time constraints on this transition is of interest because it identifies the time when oxidative weathering became efficient, when ocean chemistry was transformed by delivery of oxygen and sulphate, and when a large part of Earth's ecology changed from anaerobic to aerobic(1). The observation of non-mass-dependent sulphur isotope ratios in sedimentary rocks more than similar to 2.45 billion years (2.45 Gyr) old and the disappearance of this signal in younger sediments is taken as one of the strongest lines of evidence for the transition from an anoxic to an oxic atmosphere around 2.45 Gyr ago(1-5). Detailed examination of the sulphur isotope record before 2.45 Gyr ago also reveals early and late periods of large amplitude non-mass-dependent signals bracketing an intervening period when the signal was attenuated(5-9). Until recently, this record has been too sparse to allow interpretation, but collection of new data has prompted some workers(8) to argue that the Mesoarchaean interval (3.2-2.8 Gyr ago) lacks a non-mass-dependent signal, and records the effects of earlier and possibly permanent oxygenation of the Earth's atmosphere.

Theoretical and modelling studies predict that relative humidity will remain approximately constant at the global scale as the climate warms, leading to an increase in specific humidity(1,4,5). Although significant increases in surface specific humidity have been identified in several regions(6-9), and on the global scale in non-homogenized data(10), it has not been shown whether these changes are due to natural or human influences on climate. Here we use a new quality-controlled and homogenized gridded observational data set of surface humidity, with output from a coupled climate model, to identify and explore the causes of changes in surface specific humidity over the late twentieth century. We identify a significant global-scale increase in surface specific humidity that is attributable mainly to human influence. Specific humidity is found to have increased in response to rising temperatures, with relative humidity remaining approximately constant. These changes may have important implications, because atmospheric humidity is a key variable in determining the geographical distribution(11-13) and maximum intensity(14) of precipitation, the potential maximum intensity of tropical cyclones(15), and human heat stress(16), and has important effects on the biosphere(17) and surface hydrology(17,18).","Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Climat Res Unit, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; Met Off, Hadley Ctr, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England","Gillett, NP (reprint author), Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Climat Res Unit, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",n.gillett@uea.ac.uk,"Jones, Philip/C-8718-2009; Thorne, Peter/F-2225-2014","Jones, Philip/0000-0001-5032-5493; Thorne, Peter/0000-0003-0485-9798",,,,36,159,171,5,66,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,11-Oct,2007,449,7163,,,,,710,U6,,10.1038/nature06207,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,218VV,WOS:000250045000041,17928858.0,No,,,11/20/17,peter w.,thorne,na,na,na,na,na

Cultural evolution allows these rules to change over time(5). Rules compete with each other: as new rules rise to prominence, old ones die away. To quantify the dynamics of language evolution, we studied the regularization of English verbs over the past 1,200 years. Although an elaborate system of productive conjugations existed in English's proto-Germanic ancestor, Modern English uses the dental suffix, '-ed', to signify past tense(6). Here we describe the emergence of this linguistic rule amidst the evolutionary decay of its exceptions, known to us as irregular verbs. We have generated a data set of verbs whose conjugations have been evolving for more than a millennium, tracking inflectional changes to 177 Old-English irregular verbs. Of these irregular verbs, 145 remained irregular in Middle English and 98 are still irregular today. We study how the rate of regularization depends on the frequency of word usage. The half-life of an irregular verb scales as the square root of its usage frequency: a verb that is 100 times less frequent regularizes 10 times as fast. Our study provides a quantitative analysis of the regularization process by which ancestral forms gradually yield to an emerging linguistic rule.","Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Program Evolutionary Dynam, Dept Math, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Harvard Univ, Dept Appl Math, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; MIT, Harvard Mit Div Hlth Sci & Technol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Lieberman, E (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Program Evolutionary Dynam, Dept Math, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",erez@erez.com,"Lieberman-Aiden, Erez/A-2908-2010; Nowak, Martin/A-6977-2008",,"NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM078986, R01 GM078986-02]",,,28,120,126,1,33,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-Oct,2007,449,7163,,,,,713,716,,10.1038/nature06137,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,218VV,WOS:000250045000042,17928859.0,No,,,11/20/17,martin a.,nowak,male,1,1,na,na

Among more than 100 Indo-European languages and dialects, the words for some meanings (such as 'tail') evolve rapidly, being expressed across languages by dozens of unrelated words, while others evolve much more slowly-such as the number 'two', for which all Indo-European language speakers use the same related word-form(1). No general linguistic mechanism has been advanced to explain this striking variation in rates of lexical replacement among meanings. Here we use four large and divergent language corpora (English(2), Spanish(3), Russian(4) and Greek(5)) and a comparative database of 200 fundamental vocabulary meanings in 87 Indo-European languages(6) to show that the frequency with which these words are used in modern language predicts their rate of replacement over thousands of years of Indo-European language evolution. Across all 200 meanings, frequently used words evolve at slower rates and infrequently used words evolve more rapidly. This relationship holds separately and identically across parts of speech for each of the four language corpora, and accounts for approximately 50% of the variation in historical rates of lexical replacement. We propose that the frequency with which specific words are used in everyday language exerts a general and law-like influence on their rates of evolution. Our findings are consistent with social models of word change that emphasize the role of selection, and suggest that owing to the ways that humans use language, some words will evolve slowly and others rapidly across all languages.","Univ Reading, Sch Biol Sci, Reading RG6 6AS, Berks, England; Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA","Pagel, M (reprint author), Univ Reading, Sch Biol Sci, Reading RG6 6AS, Berks, England.",m.pagel@reading.ac.uk,,"Atkinson, Quentin/0000-0002-8499-7535",,,,35,158,161,0,28,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-Oct,2007,449,7163,,,,,717,U7,,10.1038/nature06176,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,218VV,WOS:000250045000043,17928860.0,No,,,11/20/17,andrew,meade,male,1,5168,7LWApVAAAAAJ,139

We investigated whether phagocytes are capable of de novo production of catecholamines, suggesting an autocrine/paracrine self-regulatory mechanism by catecholamines during inflammation, as has been described for lymphocytes(3). Here we show that exposure of phagocytes to lipopolysaccharide led to a release of catecholamines and an induction of catecholamine-generating and degrading enzymes, indicating the presence of the complete intracellular machinery for the generation, release and inactivation of catecholamines. To assess the importance of these findings in vivo, we chose two models of acute lung injury. Blockade of alpha(2)-adrenoreceptors or catecholamine-generating enzymes greatly suppressed lung inflammation, whereas the opposite was the case either for an alpha(2)-adrenoreceptor agonist or for inhibition of catecholamine-degrading enzymes. We were able to exclude T cells or sympathetic nerve endings as sources of the injury-modulating catecholamines.

Whereas the non-homologous glutamate transporters mediate chloride conductance(3), in the eukaryotic NSS chloride is transported together with the neurotransmitter(4-7). In contrast, transport by the bacterial NSS family members LeuT, Tyt1 and TnaT is chloride independent(8-10). The crystal structure of LeuT reveals an occluded binding pocket containing leucine and two sodium ions(9), and is highly relevant for the neurotransmitter transporters(11-13). However, the precise role of chloride in neurotransmitter transport and the location of its binding site remain elusive. Here we show that introduction of a negatively charged amino acid at or near one of the two putative sodium-binding sites of the GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) transporter GAT-1 from rat brain (also called SLC6A1)(14,15) renders both net flux and exchange of GABA largely chloride independent. In contrast to wild-type GAT-1, a marked stimulation of the rate of net flux, but not of exchange, was observed when the internal pH was lowered. Equivalent mutations introduced in the mouse GABA transporter GAT4 (SLC6A11) and the human dopamine transporter DAT (SLC6A3) also result in chloride-independent transport, whereas the reciprocal mutations in LeuT and Tyt1 render substrate binding and/or uptake by these bacterial NSS chloride dependent. Our data indicate that the negative charge, provided either by chloride or by the transporter itself, is required during binding and translocation of the neurotransmitter, probably to counterbalance the charge of the co-transported sodium ions.","Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Hadassah Med Sch, Dept Biochem, IL-91120 Jerusalem, Israel; Columbia Univ, Ctr Mol Recognit, New York, NY 10032 USA; Columbia Univ, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10032 USA; Columbia Univ, Dept Pharmacol, New York, NY 10032 USA; New York State Psychiat Inst & Hosp, Div Mol Therapeut, New York, NY 10032 USA","Kanner, BI (reprint author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Hadassah Med Sch, Dept Biochem, POB 12272, IL-91120 Jerusalem, Israel.",kannerb@cc.huji.ac.il,"Zhao, Yongfang/B-5437-2010",,NIDA NIH HHS [K05 DA022413],,,27,140,141,0,15,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-Oct,2007,449,7163,,,,,726,U9,,10.1038/nature06133,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,218VV,WOS:000250045000045,17704762.0,No,,,11/20/17,baruch i.,kanner,na,na,na,na,na

The polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) mediates transcriptional repression by catalysing the di- and tri-methylation of Lys 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me2/me3)(3). Owing to the essential role of the PRC2 complex in repressing a large number of genes involved in somatic processes, the H3K27me3 mark is associated with the unique epigenetic state of stem cells(4-7). The rapid decrease of the H3K27me3 mark during specific stages of embryogenesis and stem-cell differentiation indicates that histone demethylases specific for H3K27me3 may exist. Here we show that the human JmjC-domain-containing proteins UTX and JMJD3 demethylate tri-methylated Lys 27 on histone H3. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ectopic expression of JMJD3 leads to a strong decrease of H3K27me3 levels and causes delocalization of polycomb proteins in vivo. Consistent with the strong decrease in H3K27me3 levels associated with HOX genes during differentiation, we show that UTX directly binds to the HOXB1 locus and is required for its activation. Finally mutation of F18E9.5, a Caenorhabditis elegans JMJD3 orthologue, or inhibition of its expression, results in abnormal gonad development. Taken together, these results suggest that H3K27me3 demethylation regulated by UTX/JMJD3 proteins is essential for proper development. Moreover, the recent demonstration that UTX associates with the H3K4me3 histone methyltransferase MLL2 (ref. 8) supports a model in which the coordinated removal of repressive marks, polycomb group displacement, and deposition of activating marks are important for the stringent regulation of transcription during cellular differentiation.","Univ Copenhagen, Biotech Res & Innovat Ctr, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark; Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Epigenet, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark; Univ Edinburgh, Wellcome Trust Ctr Cell Biol, Edinburgh EH9 3JR, Midlothian, Scotland; Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Mol Cell Biol, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel","Helin, K (reprint author), Univ Copenhagen, Biotech Res & Innovat Ctr, Ole Maaloes Vej 5, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.",kristian.helin@bric.dk,"Pasini, Diego/J-9674-2012; Rappsilber, Juri/B-7265-2015; Salcini, Anna Elisabetta/G-4472-2017","Pasini, Diego/0000-0002-9879-6486; Rappsilber, Juri/0000-0001-5999-1310; Salcini, Anna Elisabetta/0000-0001-5828-2512; Helin, Kristian/0000-0003-1975-6097",,,,20,629,658,7,70,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-Oct,2007,449,7163,,,,,731,U10,,10.1038/nature06145,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,218VV,WOS:000250045000046,17713478.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,kristian,helin,male,0.94,375,sjBhDZYAAAAJ,33549

The AAA ATPase Vps4, which is central to endosomal traffic to lysosomes(2,3), retroviral budding(4) and cytokinesis(5), dissociates ESCRT complexes (the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport) from membranes(6-15). Here we show that, of the six ESCRT-III-related subunits in yeast, only Vps2 and Did2 bind the MIT (microtubule interacting and transport) domain of Vps4, and that the carboxy-terminal 30 residues of the subunits are both necessary and sufficient for interaction. We determined the crystal structure of the Vps2 C terminus in a complex with the Vps4 MIT domain, explaining the basis for selective ESCRT-III recognition. MIT helices alpha 2 and alpha 3 recognize a (D/E) xxLxxRLxxL(K/R) motif, and mutations within this motif cause sorting defects in yeast. Our crystal structure of the amino-terminal domain of an archaeal AAA ATPase of unknown function shows that it is closely related to the MIT domain of Vps4. The archaeal ATPase interacts with an archaeal ESCRT-III-like protein even though these organisms have no endomembrane system, suggesting that the Vps4/ESCRT-III partnership is a relic of a function that pre-dates the divergence of eukaryotes and Archaea.","MRC, Mol Biol Lab, MRC Ctr, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England; Cornell Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; Cornell Univ, Inst Cell & Mol Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Williams, RL (reprint author), MRC, Mol Biol Lab, MRC Ctr, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England.",rlw@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk,"Gill, David/H-7691-2013","Gill, David/0000-0002-0937-9737",Medical Research Council [MC_U105184308],,,30,184,190,0,11,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-Oct,2007,449,7163,,,,,735,U11,,10.1038/nature06171,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,218VV,WOS:000250045000047,17928861.0,No,,,11/20/17,roger l.,williams,na,na,na,na,na

Here we show that the microtubule interacting and transport (MIT) domains of human VPS4A and VPS4B bind conserved sequence motifs located at the carboxy termini of the CHMP1-3 class of ESCRT-III proteins. Structures of VPS4A MIT-CHMP1A and VPS4B MIT-CHMP2B complexes reveal that the C-terminal CHMP motif forms an amphipathic helix that binds in a groove between the last two helices of the tetratricopeptide-like repeat (TPR) of the VPS4 MIT domain, but in the opposite orientation to that of a canonical TPR interaction. Distinct pockets in the MIT domain bind three conserved leucine residues of the CHMP motif, and mutations that inhibit these interactions block VPS4 recruitment, impair endosomal protein sorting and relieve dominant-negative VPS4 inhibition of HIV budding. Thus, our studies reveal how the VPS4 ATPases recognize their CHMP substrates to facilitate the membrane fission events required for the release of viruses, endosomal vesicles and daughter cells.","Univ Utah, Dept Biochem, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA","Sundquist, WI (reprint author), Univ Utah, Dept Biochem, Room 4100,15 N Med Dr E, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",wes@biochem.utah.edu,,,NIAID NIH HHS [R01 AI051174]; NIGMS NIH HHS [P50 GM082545],,,30,187,192,1,6,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,11-Oct,2007,449,7163,,,,,740,744,,10.1038/nature06172,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,218VV,WOS:000250045000048,17928862.0,No,,,11/20/17,wesley i.,sundquist,na,na,na,na,na

The breast cancer cells stimulate de novo secretion of the chemokine CCL5 (also called RANTES) from mesenchymal stem cells, which then acts in a paracrine fashion on the cancer cells to enhance their motility, invasion and metastasis. This enhanced metastatic ability is reversible and is dependent on CCL5 signalling through the chemokine receptor CCR5. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the tumour microenvironment facilitates metastatic spread by eliciting reversible changes in the phenotype of cancer cells.","Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; Genzyme Corp, Framingham, MA 01701 USA; Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Weinberg, RA (reprint author), Whitehead Inst Biomed Res, 9 Cambridge Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",weinberg@wi.mit.edu,,,"NCI NIH HHS [P50 CA089393, P50 CA089393-060014, P50 CA089393-070014, P50 CA089393-080014, R01 CA116235, R01 CA116235-01A1, R01 CA116235-02, R01 CA116235-03]",,,36,1647,1740,12,236,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-Oct,2007,449,7162,,,,,557,U4,,10.1038/nature06188,,9,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,216QG,WOS:000249893500036,17914389.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,robert a.,weinberg,na,na,na,na,na

Here we identify the antimicrobial peptide LL37 (also known as CAMP) as the key factor that mediates pDC activation in psoriasis, a common autoimmune disease of the skin. LL37 converts inert self-DNA into a potent trigger of interferon production by binding the DNA to form aggregated and condensed structures that are delivered to and retained within early endocytic compartments in pDCs to trigger Toll-like receptor 9. Thus, our data uncover a fundamental role of an endogenous antimicrobial peptide in breaking innate tolerance to self-DNA and suggest that this pathway may drive autoimmunity in psoriasis.","Univ Texas, MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Immunol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; Univ Texas, MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Melanoma Med Oncol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; Genentech Inc, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; Univ Dusseldorf, Dept Dermatol, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany; Kings Coll London Sch Med, St Johns Inst Dermatol, London SE1 9RT, England; Univ Kiel, Univ Hosp Schleswig Holstein, Dept Dermatol, D-24105 Kiel, Germany","Gilliet, M (reprint author), Univ Texas, MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Immunol, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",mgilliet@mdanderson.org,"Schroeder, Jens/B-3994-2009; LANDE, ROBERTO/B-9987-2016","LANDE, ROBERTO/0000-0001-8398-4567; Cao, Wei/0000-0002-8952-9159",,,,42,840,879,6,67,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-Oct,2007,449,7162,,,,,564,U6,,10.1038/nature06116,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,216QG,WOS:000249893500037,17873860.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,michel,gilliet,male,0.96,729,LO2b5k4AAAAJ,16627

The xeroderma pigmentosum C (XPC) protein has a central role in initiating global-genome NER by recognizing the lesion and recruiting downstream factors. Here we present the crystal structure of the yeast XPC orthologue Rad4 bound to DNA containing a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) lesion. The structure shows that Rad4 inserts a beta-hairpin through the DNA duplex, causing the two damaged base pairs to flip out of the double helix. The expelled nucleotides of the undamaged strand are recognized by Rad4, whereas the two CPD-linked nucleotides become disordered. These findings indicate that the lesions recognized by Rad4/XPC thermodynamically destabilize the Watson-Crick double helix in a manner that facilitates the flipping-out of two base pairs.","Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Struct Biol Program, New York, NY 10021 USA; Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10021 USA","Pavletich, NP (reprint author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Struct Biol Program, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA.",pavletin@mkscc.org,,,,,,50,232,243,1,28,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-Oct,2007,449,7162,,,,,570,U7,,10.1038/nature06155,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,216QG,WOS:000249893500038,17882165.0,No,,,11/20/17,nikola p.,pavletich,na,na,na,na,na

A key issue in this long-standing conjecture is a theoretical prediction that the interstellar magnetic field can be substantially amplified at the shock of a young supernova remnant (SNR) through magnetohydrodynamic waves generated by cosmic rays(2,3). Here we report a discovery of the brightening and decay of X-ray hot spots in the shell of the SNR RX J1713.7-3946 on a one-year timescale. This rapid variability shows that the X-rays are produced by ultrarelativistic electrons through a synchrotron process and that electron acceleration does indeed take place in a strongly magnetized environment, indicating amplification of the magnetic field by a factor of more than 100. The X-ray variability also implies that we have witnessed the ongoing shock-acceleration of electrons in real time. Independently, broadband X-ray spectro-metric measurements(4) of RX J1713.7-3946 indicate that electron acceleration proceeds in the most effective ('Bohm-diffusion') regime.

Josephson effects were first discovered in a system of two superconductors, the macroscopic wavefunctions of which are weakly coupled via a tunnelling barrier(1,2). In the a.c. Josephson effect(1-7), a constant chemical potential difference (voltage) is applied, which causes an oscillating current to flow through the barrier. Because the frequency is proportional to the chemical potential difference only, the a.c. Josephson effect serves as a voltage standard(2). In the d.c. Josephson effect, a small constant current is applied, resulting in a constant supercurrent flowing through the barrier(4,5,8). In a sense, the particles do not 'feel' the presence of the tall tunnelling barrier, and flow freely through it with no driving potential. Bose-Einstein condensates should also support Josephson effects(9); however, while plasma oscillations have been seen(10) in a single Bose-Einstein condensate Josephson junction, the a.c. Josephson effect remains elusive. Here we observe the a.c. and d.c. Josephson effects in a single Bose-Einstein condensate Josephson junction. The d.c. Josephson effect has been observed previously only in superconducting systems(11); in our study, it is evident when we measure the chemical potential-current relation of the Bose-Einstein condensate Josephson junction(4,11). Our system constitutes a trapped-atom interferometer(12,13) with continuous readout(14), which operates on the basis of the a.c. Josephson effect. In addition, the measured chemical potential-current relation shows that the device is suitable for use as an analogue of the superconducting quantum interference device, which would sense rotation(2,15).","Technion Israel Inst Technol, Dept Phys, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel","Steinhauer, J (reprint author), Technion Israel Inst Technol, Dept Phys, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel.",jeffs@physics.technion.ac.il,,,,,,32,267,269,0,30,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-Oct,2007,449,7162,,,,,579,U8,,10.1038/nature06186,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,216QG,WOS:000249893500040,17914391.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,j.,steinhauer,na,na,na,na,na

However, in many unconventional superconductors, the formation of the energy gap is not coincident with the formation of the phase-coherent super-fluid. Instead, at temperatures above the critical temperature a range of unusual properties, collectively known as 'pseudogap phenomena', are observed(2). Here we argue that a key pseudogap phenomenon-fluctuating superconductivity occurring substantially above the transition temperature-could be induced by the proximity of a Mott-insulating state. The Mott-insulating state in the kappa-(BEDT-TTF)(2)X organic molecular metals(3-5) can be tuned, without doping, through superconductivity into a normal metallic state as a function of the parameter t/U, where t is the tight-binding transfer integral characterizing the metallic bandwidth and U is the on-site Coulomb repulsion. By exploiting a particularly sensitive probe of superconducting fluctuations, the vortex-Nernst effect, we find that a fluctuating regime develops as t/U decreases and the role of Coulomb correlations increases.","Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Clarendon Lab, Oxford OX1 3PU, England; Argonne Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Argonne, IL 60439 USA","Ardavan, A (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Clarendon Lab, Oxford OX1 3PU, England.",arzhang.ardavan@physics.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,33,46,46,0,31,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-Oct,2007,449,7162,,,,,584,587,,10.1038/nature06182,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,216QG,WOS:000249893500041,17914392.0,No,,,11/20/17,john a.,schlueter,na,na,na,na,na

Glacial moraines provide a method of reconstructing past temperatures, but they are relatively rare in the tropics. Here we present a reconstruction of atmospheric temperatures in the central Pacific during the last deglaciation on the basis of cosmogenic He-3 ages of moraines and numerical modelling of the ice cap on Mauna Kea volcano, Hawaii-the only highland in the central Pacific on which moraines that formed during the last glacial period are preserved(2). Our reconstruction indicates that the Last Glacial Maximum occurred between 19,000 and 16,000 years ago in this region and that temperatures at high elevations were about 7 degrees C lower than today during this interval. Glacial retreat began about 16,000 years ago, but temperatures were still about 6.5 degrees C lower than today until 15,000 years ago. When combined with estimates of sea surface temperatures in the central Pacific Ocean(3), our reconstruction indicates that the lapse rate during the Last Glacial Maximum was higher than at present, which is consistent with the proposal that the atmosphere was drier at that time(1,4). Furthermore, the persistence of full glacial conditions until 15,000 years ago is consistent with the relatively late and abrupt transition to warmer temperatures in Greenland(5), indicating that there may have been an atmospheric teleconnection between the central Pacific and North Atlantic regions during the last deglaciation.","Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, Ctr Europeen Rech & Enseignement Geosci Environm, F-13545 Aix En Provence, France; CNRS, Ctr Rech Petrog & Geochim, F-54501 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France; Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, Lab Geodynam Chaines Alpines, F-38400 Grenoble, France; Inst Rech Dev Great Ice, Lab Glaciol & Geophys Environm, F-38402 St Martin Dheres, France","Blard, PH (reprint author), CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, MC 100-23,1200 E Calif Blvd, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",blard@gps.caltech.edu,,"Bourles, Didier/0000-0001-5991-6126",,,,41,35,35,1,13,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-Oct,2007,449,7162,,,,,591,U10,,10.1038/nature06142,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,216QG,WOS:000249893500043,17914394.0,No,,,11/20/17,d.,bourles,na,na,na,na,na

Finds in Lower Cambrian rocks of the Phosphatocopina, the fossil sister group to eucrustaceans(2), imply that members of the eucrustacean stem lineage co-occurred, but it remained unclear whether crown-group members were also present at that time. 'Orsten'-type fossils are typically tiny embryos and cuticle-bearing animals, of which the cuticle is phosphatized and the material is three-dimensional and complete with soft parts. Such fossils are found predominantly in the Cambrian and Ordovician and provide detailed morphological and phylogenetic information on the early evolution of metazoans. Here we report an Orsten-type Konservat-Lagerstatte from the Lower Cambrian of China that contains at least three new arthropod species, of which we describe the most abundant form on the basis of exceptionally well preserved material of several growth stages. The limb morphology and other details of this new species are markedly similar to those of living cephalocarids, branchiopods and copepods and it is assigned to the Eucrustacea, thus representing the first undoubted crown-group crustacean from the early Cambrian. Its stratigraphical position provides substantial support to the proposition that the main cladogenic event that gave rise to the Arthropoda was before the Cambrian(3). Small leaf-shaped structures on the outer limb base of the new species provide evidence on the long-debated issue of the origin of epipodites(4,5): they occur in a set of three, derive from setae and are a ground-pattern feature of Eucrustacea.","Yunnan Univ, Key Lab Palaeobiol, Kunming 650091, Peoples R China; Univ Leicester, Dept Geol, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; Univ Ulm, Sect Biosystemat Documentat, D-98081 Ulm, Germany","Zhang, XG (reprint author), Yunnan Univ, Key Lab Palaeobiol, Kunming 650091, Peoples R China.",xgzhang@ynu.edu.cn,,,,,,30,78,90,2,12,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-Oct,2007,449,7162,,,,,595,598,,10.1038/nature06138,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,216QG,WOS:000249893500044,17914395.0,No,,,11/20/17,andreas,maas,male,1,1021,na,na

The build-up of complexity in communities is theoretically difficult, because in random-pattern models complexity leads to instability(1). There is growing evidence, however, that nonrandom patterns in the strengths of the interactions between predators and prey strongly enhance system stability(2-4). Here we show how such patterns explain stability in naturally assembling communities. We present two series of below-ground food webs along natural productivity gradients in vegetation successions(5,6). The complexity of the food webs increased along the gradients. The stability of the food webs was captured by measuring the weight of feedback loops(7) of three interacting 'species' locked in omnivory. Low predator-prey biomass ratios in these omnivorous loops were shown to have a crucial role in preserving stability as productivity and complexity increased during succession. Our results show the build-up of food-web complexity in natural productivity gradients and pin down the feedback loops that govern the stability of whole webs. They show that it is the heaviest three-link feedback loop in a network of predator-prey effects that limits its stability. Because the weight of these feedback loops is kept relatively low by the biomass build-up in the successional process, complexity does not lead to instability.","Univ York, Dept Environm, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; Univ Utrecht, Fac Vet Med, NL-3508 TD Utrecht, Netherlands; Netherlands Inst Ecol, NIOO KNAW, Ctr Estuarine & Marine Ecol, Spatial Ecol Dept, NL-4400 AC Yerseke, Netherlands; Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Dept ICT, NL-6700 AB Wageningen, Netherlands; Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Soil Sci Ctr, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; Wageningen Univ, Nat Conservat & Plant Ecol Grp, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev & Innovat, Dept Environm Sci, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands","Neutel, AM (reprint author), British Antarctic Survey, High Cross,Madingley Rd, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England.",anjute@bas.ac.uk,"Van de Koppel, Johan/E-7266-2010",,,,,29,166,172,4,125,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-Oct,2007,449,7162,,,,,599,U11,,10.1038/nature06154,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,216QG,WOS:000249893500045,17914396.0,No,,,11/20/17,peter c.,de ruiter,na,na,na,na,na

Even highlights and shadows within a single visual scene can differ similar to 10,000-fold in intensity-exceeding the range of distinct neural signals by a factor of similar to 100. The effectiveness of daylight vision under these conditions relies on at least two retinal mechanisms that adjust sensitivity in the similar to 200 ms intervals between saccades(1). One mechanism is in the cone photoreceptors (receptor adaptation)(2-5) and the other is at a previously unknown location within the retinal circuitry that benefits from convergence of signals from multiple cones (post-receptor adaptation)(6,7). Here we find that post-receptor adaptation occurs as signals are relayed from cone bipolar cells to ganglion cells.

These anaesthetics block sodium channels and thereby the excitability of all neurons, not just sensory neurons. We tested the possibility of selectively blocking the excitability of primary sensory nociceptor (pain-sensing) neurons by introducing the charged, membrane-impermeant lidocaine derivative QX-314 through the pore of the noxious-heat-sensitive TRPV1 channel. Here we show that charged sodium-channel blockers can be targeted into nociceptors by the application of TRPV1 agonists to produce a pain-specific local anaesthesia. QX-314 applied externally had no effect on the activity of sodium channels in small sensory neurons when applied alone, but when applied in the presence of the TRPV1 agonist capsaicin, QX-314 blocked sodium channels and inhibited excitability. Inhibition by co-applied QX-314 and capsaicin was restricted to neurons expressing TRPV1. Injection of QX-314 together with capsaicin into rat hindpaws produced a long-lasting (more than 2 h) increase in mechanical and thermal nociceptive thresholds. Long-lasting decreases in pain sensitivity were also seen with regional injection of QX-314 and capsaicin near the sciatic nerve; however, in contrast to the effect of lidocaine, the application of QX-314 and capsaicin together was not accompanied by motor or tactile deficits.","Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Anesthesia & Crit Care, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA","Bean, BP (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, 220 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",bruce_bean@hms.harvard.edu,"Marion-Poll, Frederic/D-8882-2011","Marion-Poll, Frederic/0000-0001-6824-0180",,,,16,210,217,3,32,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-Oct,2007,449,7162,,,,,607,U13,,10.1038/nature06191,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,216QG,WOS:000249893500047,17914397.0,No,,,11/20/17,clifford j.,woolf,na,na,na,na,na

Phage T4 endonuclease VII (endo VII) was the first enzyme shown to resolve Holliday junctions into duplex DNAs by introducing symmetrical nicks in equivalent strands(3). Several Holliday junction resolvases have since been characterized(4), but an atomic structure of a resolvase complex with a Holliday junction remained elusive. Here we report the crystal structure of an inactive T4 endo VII(N62D) complexed with an immobile four-way junction with alternating arm lengths of 10 and 14 base pairs. The junction is a hybrid of the conventional square-planar and stacked-X conformation. Endo VII protrudes into the junction point from the minor groove side, opening it to a 14 angstrom x 32 angstrom parallelogram. This interaction interrupts the coaxial stacking, yet every base pair surrounding the junction remains intact. Additional interactions involve the positively charged protein and DNA phosphate backbones. Each scissile phosphate that is two base pairs from the crossover interacts with a Mg2+ ion in the active site. The similar overall shape and surface charge potential of the Holliday junction resolvases endo VII, RuvC, Ydc2, Hjc and RecU, despite having different folds, active site composition and DNA sequence preference, suggest a conserved binding mode for Holliday junctions.","NIDDKD, Mol Biol Lab, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; European Mol Biol Lab, Struct & Computat Biol Programme, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany","Yang, W (reprint author), NIDDKD, Mol Biol Lab, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",wei.yang@nih.gov; suck@embl.de,"Yang, Wei/D-4926-2011","Yang, Wei/0000-0002-3591-2195; Biertumpfel, Christian/0000-0002-7528-6547",Intramural NIH HHS,,,39,62,63,2,16,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-Oct,2007,449,7162,,,,,616,U14,,10.1038/nature06152,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,216QG,WOS:000249893500049,17873859.0,No,,,11/20/17,dietrich,suck,male,1,6,na,na

The penultimate stage of recombination requires resolution of the DNA junction into nicked-duplex species by the action of a junction-resolving enzyme, examples of which have been identified in a wide variety of organisms(2). These enzymes are nucleases that are highly selective for the structure of branched DNA. The mechanism of this selectivity has, however, been unclear in the absence of structural data. Here we present the crystal structure of the junction-resolving enzyme phage T7 endonuclease I in complex with a synthetic four-way DNA junction. Although the enzyme is structure-selective, significant induced fit occurs in the interaction, with changes in the structure of both the protein and the junction. The dimeric enzyme presents two binding channels that contact the backbones of the junction's helical arms over seven nucleotides. These interactions effectively measure the relative orientations and positions of the arms of the junction, thereby ensuring that binding is selective for branched DNA that can achieve this geometry.","Univ Leeds, Fac Biol Sci, Inst Mol & Cellular Biol, Astbury Ctr Struct Mol Biol, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; Univ Dundee, Canc Res UK, Nucl Acid Struct Res Grp, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland","Phillips, SEV (reprint author), Univ Leeds, Fac Biol Sci, Inst Mol & Cellular Biol, Astbury Ctr Struct Mol Biol, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",s.e.v.phillips@leeds.ac.uk,,"Declais, Anne-Cecile/0000-0002-1904-6469",Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/E001777/1]; Cancer Research UK [11722]; Wellcome Trust,,,32,51,53,2,17,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,4-Oct,2007,449,7162,,,,,621,U15,,10.1038/nature06158,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,216QG,WOS:000249893500050,17873858.0,No,,,11/20/17,simon e. v.,phillips,na,na,na,na,na

The inhibitory cascade acts as a ratchet that determines molar size differences along the jaw, one effect being that the second molar always makes up one-third of total molar area. By using a macroevolutionary test, we demonstrate the success of the model in predicting dentition patterns found among murine rodent species with various diets, thereby providing an example of ecologically driven evolution along a developmentally favoured trajectory.

Efficient removal of uracil is essential for prevention of C-to-T transition mutations arising from cytosine deamination, cytotoxic U center dot A pairs arising from incorporation of dUTP in DNA, and for increasing immunoglobulin gene diversity during the acquired immune response. A central event in all of these UNG-mediated processes is the singling out of rare U center dot A or U center dot G base pairs in a background of approximately 10(9) T center dot A or C center dot G base pairs in the human genome. Here we establish for the human and Escherichia coli enzymes that discrimination of thymine and uracil is initiated by thermally induced opening of T center dot A and U center dot A base pairs and not by active participation of the enzyme.

Superconducting qubits made with scalable microfabrication techniques are a promising candidate for the realization of a large-scale quantum information processor(5-9). Although these systems have successfully passed tests of coherent coupling for up to four qubits(10-13), communication of individual quantum states between superconducting qubits via a quantum bus has not yet been realized. Here, we perform an experiment demonstrating the ability to coherently transfer quantum states between two superconducting Josephson phase qubits through a quantum bus. This quantum bus is a resonant cavity formed by an open-ended superconducting transmission line of length 7 mm. After preparing an initial quantum state with the first qubit, this quantum information is transferred and stored as a nonclassical photon state of the resonant cavity, then retrieved later by the second qubit connected to the opposite end of the cavity. Beyond simple state transfer, these results suggest that a high-quality-factor superconducting cavity could also function as a useful short-term memory element. The basic architecture presented here can be expanded, offering the possibility for the coherent interaction of a large number of superconducting qubits.","NIST, Boulder, CO 80305 USA","Simmonds, RW (reprint author), NIST, 325 Broadway, Boulder, CO 80305 USA.",simmonds@boulder.nist.gov,"Sillanpaa, Mika/A-3554-2013",,,,,30,380,385,3,40,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Sep,2007,449,7161,,,,,438,442,,10.1038/nature06124,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,214GQ,WOS:000249724800035,17898762.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,raymond w.,simmonds,na,na,na,na,na

These experiments show that two nearby qubits can be readily coupled with local interactions. Performing gate operations between an arbitrary pair of distant qubits is highly desirable for any quantum computer architecture, but has not yet been demonstrated. An efficient way to achieve this goal is to couple the qubits to a 'quantum bus', which distributes quantum information among the qubits. Here we show the implementation of such a quantum bus, using microwave photons confined in a transmission line cavity, to couple two superconducting qubits on opposite sides of a chip. The interaction is mediated by the exchange of virtual rather than real photons, avoiding cavity-induced loss. Using fast control of the qubits to switch the coupling effectively on and off, we demonstrate coherent transfer of quantum states between the qubits. The cavity is also used to perform multiplexed control and measurement of the qubit states. This approach can be expanded to more than two qubits, and is an attractive architecture for quantum information processing on a chip.","Yale Univ, Dept Appl Phys, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Majer, J (reprint author), Yale Univ, Dept Appl Phys, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",johannes.majer@yale.edu; robert.schoelkopf@yale.edu,"Majer, Johannes/C-1864-2008; Blais, Alexandre/E-3315-2010; Schoelkopf, Robert/J-8178-2012; Wallraff, Andreas/C-2130-2009; Koch, Jens/G-6789-2011","Majer, Johannes/0000-0002-5192-1809; Blais, Alexandre/0000-0002-0591-2012; Wallraff, Andreas/0000-0002-3476-4485; Koch, Jens/0000-0002-5047-631X; Frunzio, Luigi/0000-0002-0272-5481",,,,28,647,659,16,96,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Sep,2007,449,7161,,,,,443,447,,10.1038/nature06184,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,214GQ,WOS:000249724800036,17898763.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,r. j.,schoelkopf,na,na,na,na,na

However, they were found recently to exhibit unexpected complexity under pressure(1-6). It was predicted from theory(1,2)-and later confirmed by experiment(3-5)-that lithium and sodium undergo a sequence of symmetry-breaking transitions, driven by a Peierls mechanism, at high pressures. Measurements of the sodium melting curve(6) have subsequently revealed an unprecedented (and still unexplained) pressure-induced drop in melting temperature from 1,000 K at 30 GPa down to room temperature at 120 GPa. Here we report results from ab initio calculations that explain the unusual melting behaviour in dense sodium. We show that molten sodium undergoes a series of pressure-induced structural and electronic transitions, analogous to those observed in solid sodium but commencing at much lower pressure in the presence of liquid disorder. As pressure is increased, liquid sodium initially evolves by assuming a more compact local structure. However, a transition to a lower-coordinated liquid takes place at a pressure of around 65 GPa, accompanied by a threefold drop in electrical conductivity. This transition is driven by the opening of a pseudogap, at the Fermi level, in the electronic density of states-an effect that has not hitherto been observed in a liquid metal. The lower-coordinated liquid emerges at high temperatures and above the stability region of a close-packed free-electron-like metal. We predict that similar exotic behaviour is possible in other materials as well.","Univ Liege, FNRS, B-4000 Sart Tilman Par Liege, Belgium; Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Livermore, CA 94550 USA; Dalhousie Univ, Dept Phys, Halifax, NS B3H 3J5, Canada","Raty, JY (reprint author), Univ Liege, FNRS, B-4000 Sart Tilman Par Liege, Belgium.",jyraty@ulg.ac.be; stanimir.bonev@dal.ca,"Schwegler, Eric/F-7294-2010; Schwegler, Eric/A-2436-2016","Schwegler, Eric/0000-0003-3635-7418",,,,28,86,87,0,24,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,27-Sep,2007,449,7161,,,,,448,451,,10.1038/nature06123,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,214GQ,WOS:000249724800037,17898764.0,No,,,11/20/17,stanimir a.,bonev,na,na,na,na,na

Atmospheric convection over the western tropical Pacific is a major source of heat and moisture to extratropical regions, and may therefore influence the global climate response to a variety of forcing factors. The response of tropical Pacific convection to changes in global climate boundary conditions, abrupt climate changes and radiative forcing remains uncertain, however. Here we present three absolutely dated oxygen isotope records from stalagmites in northern Borneo that reflect changes in west Pacific warm pool hydrology over the past 27,000 years. Our results suggest that convection over the western tropical Pacific weakened 18,000 20,000 years ago, as tropical Pacific(2,5,6,8) and Antarctic(9) temperatures began to rise during the early stages of deglaciation. Convective activity, as inferred from oxygen isotopes, reached a minimum during Heinrich event 1 (ref. 10), when the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation was weak(11), pointing to feed-backs between the strength of the overturning circulation and tropical Pacific hydrology. There is no evidence of the Younger Dryas event(12) in the stalagmite records, however, suggesting that different mechanisms operated during these two abrupt deglacial climate events. During the Holocene epoch, convective activity appears to track changes in spring and autumn insolation, highlighting the sensitivity of tropical Pacific convection to external radiative forcing. Together, these findings demonstrate that the tropical Pacific hydrological cycle is sensitive to high-latitude climate processes in both hemispheres, as well as to external radiative forcing, and that it may have a central role in abrupt climate change events.","Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Earth & Atmospher Sci, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; Gunung Mulu Natl Pk, Sarawak, Malaysia","Partin, JW (reprint author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Earth & Atmospher Sci, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",jpartin@eas.gatech.edu,"Partin, Judson/A-3086-2012",,,,,35,179,194,7,85,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,27-Sep,2007,449,7161,,,,,452,U3,,10.1038/nature06164,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,214GQ,WOS:000249724800038,17898765.0,No,,,11/20/17,diego p.,fernandez,na,na,na,na,na

We found that pyroxene and garnet synthesized at >7 GPa in equilibrium with metallic Fe can incorporate sufficient ferric iron that the mantle at >250 km depth is so reduced that an (Fe,Ni)-metal phase may be stable. Our results indicate that the oxidized nature of the upper mantle can no longer be regarded as being representative for the Earth's upper mantle as a whole and instead that oxidation is a shallow phenomenon restricted to an upper veneer only about 250 km in thickness.","Univ Bonn, Mineral Petrol Inst, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; Univ Bonn, Museum, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; Univ Munster, Inst Mineral, D-48149 Munster, Germany; ETH, Inst Mineral & Petrog, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; Univ Tasmania, ARC, Ctr Excellence Ore Deposits, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; Univ Tasmania, Sch Earth Sci, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; Max Planck Inst Chem, Abt Kosmochem, D-55128 Mainz, Germany; SB RAS, Inst Geol & Mineral, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia","Rohrbach, A (reprint author), Univ Bonn, Mineral Petrol Inst, Poppelsdorfer Schloss, D-53115 Bonn, Germany.",rohrbaa@web.de; ballhaus@uni-bonn.de,"Kamenetsky, Vadim/B-1019-2008; Kuzmin, Dmitry/A-3809-2014","Kamenetsky, Vadim/0000-0002-2734-8790; Pauldurai, Jona/0000-0002-7217-0872",,,,32,125,134,1,41,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Sep,2007,449,7161,,,,,456,458,,10.1038/nature06183,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,214GQ,WOS:000249724800039,17898766.0,No,,,11/20/17,dmitry v.,kuzmin,na,na,na,na,na

In the Lower Yangtze region of China, a centre of rice domestication(2), the timing and system of initial rice cultivation remain unclear. Here we report detailed evidence from Kuahuqiao that reveals the precise cultural and environmental context of rice cultivation at this earliest known Neolithic site in eastern China, 7,700 calibrated years before present (cal. yr BP). Pollen, algal, fungal spore and micro-charcoal data from sediments demonstrate that these Neolithic communities selected lowland swamps for their rice cultivation and settlement, using fire to clear alder-dominated wetland scrub and prepare the site for occupation, then to maintain wet grassland vegetation of paddy type. Regular flooding by slightly brackish water was probably controlled by 'bunding' to maintain crop yields. The site's exploitation ceased when it was overwhelmed by marine inundation 7,550 cal. yr BP. Our results establish that rice cultivation began in coastal wetlands of eastern China, an ecosystem vulnerable to coastal change but of high fertility and productivity, attractions maximized for about two centuries by sustained high levels of cultural management of the environment.","Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Durham DH1 3LE, England; E China Normal Univ, Inst Estuarine & Coastal Res, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China; Fudan Univ, Dept Cultural Heritage, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; E China Normal Univ, Dept Geog, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China","Zong, Y (reprint author), Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Durham DH1 3LE, England.",y.q.zong@durham.ac.uk; j.b.innes@durham.ac.uk,,,,,,35,164,189,10,124,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Sep,2007,449,7161,,,,,459,U4,,10.1038/nature06135,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,214GQ,WOS:000249724800040,17898767.0,No,,,11/20/17,h.,wang,male,1,1,9LwnFX4AAAAJ,42652

These polyploidization events may have had important consequences in plant evolution, in particular for species radiation and adaptation and for the modulation of functional capacities(4-10). Here we report a high-quality draft of the genome sequence of grapevine (Vitis vinifera) obtained from a highly homozygous genotype. The draft sequence of the grapevine genome is the fourth one produced so far for flowering plants, the second for a woody species and the first for a fruit crop ( cultivated for both fruit and beverage). Grapevine was selected because of its important place in the cultural heritage of humanity beginning during the Neolithic period(11). Several large expansions of gene families with roles in aromatic features are observed. The grapevine genome has not undergone recent genome duplication, thus enabling the discovery of ancestral traits and features of the genetic organization of flowering plants. This analysis reveals the contribution of three ancestral genomes to the grapevine haploid content. This ancestral arrangement is common to many dicotyledonous plants but is absent from the genome of rice, which is a monocotyledon. Furthermore, we explain the chronology of previously described whole-genome duplication events in the evolution of flowering plants.","Univ Evry, CEA, F-91057 Evry, France; Univ Evry, CNRS, UMR 8030, F-91057 Evry, France; Ist Genom Applicata, I-33100 Udine, Italy; Univ Udine, Dipartimento Matemat & Informat, I-33100 Udine, Italy; Univ Evry Genom Vegetale, INRA, UMR 1165, URGV,CNRS, F-91057 Evry, France; Univ Udine, Dipartimento Sci Agr & Ambientali, I-33100 Udine, Italy; Univ Padua, CRIBI, I-35121 Padua, Italy; URGI, F-91034 Evry, France; Univ Strasbourg, INRA, UMR 1131, F-68021 Colmar, France; Univ Milan, Dipartimento Sci Biomol & Biotecnol, I-20133 Milan, Italy; Univ Bari, Dipartmento Biochim & Biol Mol, I-70125 Bari, Italy; CNR, Ist Tecnol Biomed, I-70125 Bari, Italy; Univ Montpellier 2, IRD Montpellier SupAgro, INRA, UMR 1097, F-34060 Montpellier 1, France; CIRAD, IRD Montpellier SupAgro, INRA, UMR 1098, F-34060 Montpellier 1, France; Univ Verona, Dipartimento Sci & Tecnol, I-37134 Verona, Italy; Univ Verona, Dipartimento Sci Tecnol & Mercati Vite & Vino, I-37029 S Floriano, VR, Italy; Univ Siena, VIGNA, CRA Initiat, I-53100 Siena, Italy; Univ Siena, Consorzio Interuniv Nazl Biol Mol Piante, I-53100 Siena, Italy","Wincker, P (reprint author), Univ Evry, CEA, 2 Rue Gaston Cremieux,BP5706, F-91057 Evry, France.",pwincker@genoscope.cns.fr,"; Pesole, Graziano/C-1408-2009; Del Fabbro, Cristian/C-5523-2014; Pesole, Graziano/E-9051-2014; Jublot, Delphine/M-7102-2014; Casagrande, Alberto/N-1197-2015","AURY, Jean-Marc/0000-0003-1718-3010; Alaux, Michael/0000-0001-9356-4072; Vitulo, Nicola/0000-0002-9571-0747; Hugueney, Philippe/0000-0002-1641-9274; Pesole, Graziano/0000-0003-3663-0859; Del Fabbro, Cristian/0000-0001-8189-6192; Pesole, Graziano/0000-0003-3663-0859; Casagrande, Alberto/0000-0002-8681-1482; ADAM-BLONDON, Anne-Francoise/0000-0002-3412-9086; Quetier, Francis/0000-0003-4388-9287; VALLE, GIORGIO/0000-0003-4377-5685",,,,40,1635,1968,15,310,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Sep,2007,449,7161,,,,,463,U5,,10.1038/nature06148,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,214GQ,WOS:000249724800041,17721507.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,patrick,wincker,male,1,2877,na,na

For instance, androstenone (5 alpha-androst-16-en-3-one), an odorous steroid derived from testosterone, is variously perceived by different individuals as offensive (""sweaty, urinous''), pleasant (""sweet, floral'') or odourless(1-3). Similar variation in odour perception has been observed for several other odours(4-6). The mechanistic basis of variation in odour perception between individuals is unknown. We investigated whether genetic variation in human odorant receptor genes accounts in part for variation in odour perception between individuals(7,8). Here we show that a human odorant receptor, OR7D4, is selectively activated in vitro by androstenone and the related odorous steroid androstadienone (androsta-4,16-dien-3-one) and does not respond to a panel of 64 other odours and two solvents. A common variant of this receptor (OR7D4 WM) contains two non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), resulting in two amino acid substitutions (R88W, T133M; hence 'RT') that severely impair function in vitro. Human subjects with RT/WM or WM/WM genotypes as a group were less sensitive to androstenone and androstadienone and found both odours less unpleasant than the RT/RT group. Genotypic variation in OR7D4 accounts for a significant proportion of the valence (pleasantness or unpleasantness) and intensity variance in perception of these steroidal odours. Our results demonstrate the first link between the function of a human odorant receptor in vitro and odour perception.","Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Mol Genet & Microbiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; Rockefeller Univ, Lab Neurogenet & Behav, New York, NY 10065 USA; Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Neurobiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA","Vosshall, LB (reprint author), Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Mol Genet & Microbiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA.",leslie@mail.rockefeller.edu; hiroaki.matsunami@duke.edu,,"Keller, Andreas/0000-0001-5491-2214; Vosshall, Leslie/0000-0002-6060-8099",,,,28,287,298,2,94,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Sep,2007,449,7161,,,,,468,U6,,10.1038/nature06162,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,214GQ,WOS:000249724800042,17873857.0,No,,,11/20/17,hiroaki,matsunami,male,1,6,na,na

The commitment of haematopoietic progenitors to the B-cell lineage(2,3) and their development to mature B lymphocytes(4,5) critically depend on the transcription factor encoded by the paired box gene 5 (Pax5). Here we show that conditional Pax5 deletion in mice allowed mature B cells from peripheral lymphoid organs to dedifferentiate in vivo back to early uncommitted progenitors in the bone marrow, which rescued T lymphopoiesis in the thymus of T-cell-deficient mice. These B-cell-derived T lymphocytes carried not only immunoglobulin heavy- and light-chain gene rearrangements but also participated as functional T cells in immune reactions. Mice lacking Pax5 in mature B cells also developed aggressive lymphomas, which were identified by their gene expression profile as progenitor cell tumours. Hence, the complete loss of Pax5 in late B cells could initiate lymphoma development and uncovered an extraordinary plasticity of mature peripheral B cells despite their advanced differentiation stage.","Vienna Bioctr, Res Inst Mol Pathol, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; Univ Hosp, Dept Pathol, CH-8091 Zurich, Switzerland","Busslinger, M (reprint author), Vienna Bioctr, Res Inst Mol Pathol, Dr Bohr Gasse 7, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",busslinger@imp.ac.at,"Cobaleda, Cesar/D-4668-2011; Busslinger, Meinrad/J-1249-2016","Busslinger, Meinrad/0000-0002-9111-9351; Cobaleda, Cesar/0000-0003-3807-9204",,,,40,295,304,0,13,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Sep,2007,449,7161,,,,,473,U8,,10.1038/nature06159,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,214GQ,WOS:000249724800043,17851532.0,No,,,11/20/17,meinrad,busslinger,male,1,2,na,na

Once mature, these cells undergo class-switch recombination (CSR) when activated by antigen. CSR changes the heavy chain constant region exons (CH) expressed with a given variable region exon from Cm to a downstream CH (for example, C gamma, C epsilon or C alpha), thereby switching expression from IgM to IgG, IgE or IgA. Both V(D)J recombination and CSR involve the introduction of DNA double-strand breaks and their repair by means of end joining(1,2). For CSR, double-strand breaks are introduced into switch regions that flank Cm and a downstream CH, followed by fusion of the broken switch regions(1). In mammalian cells, the 'classical' non-homologous end joining (C-NHEJ) pathway repairs both general DNA double-strand breaks and programmed double-strand breaks generated by V(D)J recombination(2,3). C-NHEJ, as observed during V(D)J recombination, joins ends that lack homology to form 'direct' joins, and also joins ends with several base-pair homologies to form microhomology joins(3,4). CSR joins also display direct and microhomology joins, and CSR has been suggested to use C-NHEJ(5-8). Xrcc4 and DNA ligase IV (Lig4), which cooperatively catalyse the ligation step of C-NHEJ, are the most specific C-NHEJ factors; they are absolutely required for V(D)J recombination and have no known functions other than C-NHEJ(2). Here we assess whether C-NHEJ is also critical for CSR by assaying CSR in Xrcc4- or Lig4-deficient mouse B cells. C-NHEJ indeed catalyses CSR joins, because C-NHEJ-deficient B cells had decreased CSR and substantial levels of IgH locus (immunoglobulin heavy chain, encoded by Igh) chromosomal breaks. However, an alternative end-joining pathway, which is markedly biased towards microhomology joins, supports CSR at unexpectedly robust levels in C-NHEJ-deficient B cells. In the absence of C-NHEJ, this alternative end-joining pathway also frequently joins Igh locus breaks to other chromosomes to generate translocations.","Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Childrens Hosp, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Immune Dis Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Alt, FW (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",alt@enders.tch.harvard.edu,,"Rajewsky, Klaus/0000-0002-6633-6370; Geyer, Mark/0000-0001-5248-9117",NCI NIH HHS [P01 CA092625],,,31,343,348,3,17,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Sep,2007,449,7161,,,,,478,U9,,10.1038/nature06020,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,214GQ,WOS:000249724800044,17713479.0,No,,,11/20/17,frederick w.,alt,na,na,na,na,na

V(D)J recombination, a cut-and-paste mechanism for generating diversity in antigen receptors, relies on NHEJ for repairing DSBs introduced by the Rag1-Rag2 protein complex. Animals lacking any of the seven known NHEJ factors are therefore immunodeficient(1). Nevertheless, DSB repair is not eliminated entirely in these animals: evidence of a third mechanism, 'alternative NHEJ', appears in the form of extremely rare V(D)J junctions(2-4) and a higher rate of chromosomal translocations(5,6). The paucity of these V(D)J events has suggested that alternative NHEJ contributes little to a cell's overall repair capacity, being operative only (and inefficiently) when classical NHEJ fails. Here we find that removing certain portions of murine Rag proteins reveals robust alternative NHEJ activity in NHEJ-deficient cells and some alternative joining activity even in wildtype cells.

We report X-ray structures of the amino-terminal four immunoglobulin domains (D1-D4) of two distinct Dscam isoforms. The structures reveal a horseshoe configuration, with variable residues of D2 and D3 constituting two independent surface epitopes on either side of the receptor. Both isoforms engage in homo-dimerization coupling variable domain D2 with D2, and D3 with D3. These interactions involve symmetric, antiparallel pairing of identical peptide segments from epitope I that are unique to each isoform. Structure-guided mutagenesis and swapping of peptide segments confirm that epitope I, but not epitope II, confers homophilic binding specificity of full-length Dscam receptors.

The ligand-binding site in the gamma-subunit (Snf4) has clear structural differences from that of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe enzyme(9), although our crystallographic data indicate that AMP can also bind to Snf4. The glycogen-binding domain in the beta-subunit (Sip2) interacts with Snf4 in the heterotrimer but should still be able to bind carbohydrates(10-13).

Most significantly, the structure reveals that part of the regulatory sequence in the alpha-subunit (Snf1)(15,16,18,19) is sequestered by Snf4, demonstrating a direct interaction between the alpha- and gamma-subunits and indicating that our structure may represent the heterotrimer core of SNF1 in its activated state.","Columbia Univ, Dept Biol Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA","Tong, L (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Dept Biol Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA.",ltong@columbia.edu,,"Tong, Liang/0000-0002-0563-6468",,,,37,109,113,0,8,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Sep,2007,449,7161,,,,,492,U13,,10.1038/nature06127,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,214GQ,WOS:000249724800047,17851534.0,No,,,11/20/17,liang,tong,male,0.69,48,na,na

It senses changes in the ratio of AMP/ATP by binding both species in a competitive manner(2). Thus, increases in the concentration of AMP activate AMPK resulting in the phosphorylation and differential regulation of a series of downstream targets that control anabolic and catabolic pathways(1,2). We report here the crystal structure of the regulatory fragment of mammalian AMPK in complexes with AMP and ATP. The phosphate groups of AMP/ATP lie in a groove on the surface of the gamma domain, which is lined with basic residues, many of which are associated with disease-causing mutations. Structural and solution studies reveal that two sites on the gamma domain bind either AMP or Mg center dot ATP, whereas a third site contains a tightly bound AMP that does not exchange. Our binding studies indicate that under physiological conditions AMPK mainly exists in its inactive form in complex with Mg center dot ATP, which is much more abundant than AMP. Our modelling studies suggest how changes in the concentration of AMP ([AMP]) enhance AMPK activity levels. The structure also suggests a mechanism for propagating AMP/ATP signalling whereby a phosphorylated residue from the alpha and/or beta subunits binds to the gamma subunit in the presence of AMP but not when ATP is bound.","Natl Inst Med Res, MRC, London NW7 1AA, England; Imperial Coll, MRC, Ctr Clin Sci, London W12 0NN, England","Martin, SR (reprint author), Natl Inst Med Res, MRC, Ridgeway,Mill Hill, London NW7 1AA, England.",smartin@nimr.mrc.ac.uk; david.carling@csc.mrc.ac.uk; sgambli@nimr.mrc.ac.uk,"Carling, David/F-1943-2014","Carling, David/0000-0002-2316-1830; Gamblin, Steven/0000-0001-5331-639X","Medical Research Council [MC_U117584222, MC_U120027537]",,,37,286,292,4,30,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,27-Sep,2007,449,7161,,,,,496,U14,,10.1038/nature06161,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,214GQ,WOS:000249724800048,17851531.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,steven j.,gamblin,na,na,na,na,na

Here we present data that reveal two major difficulties with this simple magmatic degassing scenario-argon seems to be compatible in the major phases of the terrestrial planets, and argon diffusion in these phases is slow at upper-mantle conditions. These results challenge the common belief that the upper mantle is nearly degassed of Ar-40, and they call into question the suitability of Ar-40 as a monitor of planetary degassing. An alternative to magmatism is needed to release argon to the atmosphere, with one possibility being hydration of oceanic lithosphere consisting of relatively argon-rich olivine and orthopyroxene.","Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Troy, NY 12180 USA","Watson, EB (reprint author), Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Troy, NY 12180 USA.",watsoe@rpi.edu,,,,,,48,33,33,1,12,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Sep,2007,449,7160,,,,,299,304,,10.1038/nature06144,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,211XP,WOS:000249557300037,17882213.0,No,,,11/20/17,daniele j.,cherniak,na,na,na,na,na

Here we describe newly excavated postcranial material from Dmanisi comprising a partial skeleton of an adolescent individual, associated with skull D2700/D2735, and the remains from three adult individuals. This material shows that the postcranial anatomy of the Dmanisi hominins has a surprising mosaic of primitive and derived features. The primitive features include a small body size, a low encephalization quotient and absence of humeral torsion; the derived features include modern-human-like body proportions and lower limb morphology indicative of the capability for long-distance travel.

Much is known of the equilibrium state, both in the weakly(4-7) and strongly(8,9) interacting regimes. However, it remains a challenge to probe the dynamics by which this equilibrium state is reached(10). Here we present a direct experimental study of the coherence dynamics in both isolated and coupled degenerate 1D Bose gases. Dynamic splitting is used to create two 1D systems in a phase coherent state(11). The time evolution of the coherence is revealed through local phase shifts of the subsequently observed interference patterns. Completely isolated 1D Bose gases are observed to exhibit universal sub-exponential coherence decay, in excellent agreement with recent predictions(12). For two coupled 1D Bose gases, the coherence factor is observed to approach a non-zero equilibrium value, as predicted by a Bogoliubov approach(13). This coupled-system decay to finite coherence is the matter wave equivalent of phase-locking two lasers by injection. The non-equilibrium dynamics of superfluids has an important role in a wide range of physical systems, such as superconductors, quantum Hall systems, superfluid helium and spin systems(14-16). Our experiments studying coherence dynamics show that 1D Bose gases are ideally suited for investigating this class of phenomena.","Heidelberg Univ, Inst Phys, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; Vienna Univ Technol, Atominst Osterreich, A-1020 Vienna, Austria; Univ Innsbruck, Inst Theoret Phys, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria","Schmiedmayer, J (reprint author), Heidelberg Univ, Inst Phys, Philosophenweg 12, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.",schmiedmayer@atomchip.org,"Schmiedmayer, Jorg/B-4717-2008; Schumm, Thorsten/B-8565-2008; Lesanovsky, Igor/J-6012-2015","Schmiedmayer, Jorg/0000-0001-7799-5614; Schumm, Thorsten/0000-0002-1066-202X; Lesanovsky, Igor/0000-0001-9660-9467; Hofferberth, Sebastian/0000-0003-0309-9715",,,,42,431,432,2,37,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Sep,2007,449,7160,,,,,324,+,,10.1038/nature06149,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,211XP,WOS:000249557300041,17882216.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,j.,schmiedmayer,na,na,na,na,na

Like all forms of light, microwaves, even those guided by the wires of an integrated circuit, consist of discrete photons(1). To enable quantum communication between distant parts of a quantum computer, the signals must also be quantum, consisting of single photons, for example. However, conventional sources can generate only classical light, not single photons. One way to realize a single-photon source(2) is to collect the fluorescence of a single atom. Early experiments measured the quantum nature of continuous radiation(3,4), and further advances allowed triggered sources of photons on demand(5-11). To allow efficient photon collection, emitters are typically placed inside optical or microwave cavities(12-19), but these sources are difficult to employ for quantum communication on wires within an integrated circuit. Here we demonstrate an on-chip, on-demand single-photon source, where the microwave photons are injected into a wire with high efficiency and spectral purity. This is accomplished in a circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture(20), with a microwave transmission line cavity that enhances the spontaneous emission of a single superconducting qubit. When the qubit spontaneously emits, the generated photon acts as a flying qubit, transmitting the quantum information across a chip. We perform tomography of both the qubit and the emitted photons, clearly showing that both the quantum phase and amplitude are transferred during the emission. Both the average power and voltage of the photon source are characterized to verify performance of the system. This single-photon source is an important addition to a rapidly growing toolbox for quantum optics on a chip.","Yale Univ, Dept Appl Phys, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; Yale Univ, Dept Phys, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Schoelkopf, RJ (reprint author), Yale Univ, Dept Appl Phys, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",robert.schoelkopf@yale.edu,"Majer, Johannes/C-1864-2008; Schoelkopf, Robert/J-8178-2012","Majer, Johannes/0000-0002-5192-1809; Frunzio, Luigi/0000-0002-0272-5481",,,,29,238,239,5,58,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Sep,2007,449,7160,,,,,328,331,,10.1038/nature06126,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,211XP,WOS:000249557300042,17882217.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,r. j.,schoelkopf,na,na,na,na,na

It has been suggested previously that high-latitude methane emissions from terrestrial environments could have enhanced the warming effect(3,4), but direct evidence for an increased methane flux from wetlands is lacking. The Cobham Lignite, a recently characterized expanded lacustrine/mire deposit in England, spans the onset of the PETM5 and therefore provides an opportunity to examine the biogeochemical response of wet-land-type ecosystems at that time. Here we report the occurrence of hopanoids, biomarkers derived from bacteria, in the mire sediments from Cobham. We measure a decrease in the carbon isotope values of the hopanoids at the onset of the PETM interval, which suggests an increase in the methanotroph population. We propose that this reflects an increase in methane production potentially driven by changes to a warmer(1,6) and wetter climate(7,8).

In frog eggs, Ca2+ activates Ca2+/calmodulin-activated kinase, which inactivates cytostatic factor(2-5), allowing the anaphase-promoting factor to turn on and ubiquitinate cyclins and securin, which returns the cell cycle to interphase(6). Here we show that the calcium-activated protein phosphatase calcineurin(7) is also important in this process. Calcineurin is transiently activated after adding Ca2+ to egg extracts, and inhibitors of calcineurin such as cyclosporin A (ref. 8) delay the destruction of cyclins, the global dephosphorylation of M-phase-specific phosphoproteins and the re-formation of a fully functional nuclear envelope. We found that a second wave of phosphatase activity directed at mitotic phosphoproteins appears after the spike of calcineurin activity. This activity disappeared the next time the extract entered M phase and reappeared at the end of mitosis. We surmise that inhibition of this second phosphatase activity is important in allowing cells to enter mitosis, and, conversely, that its activation is required for a timely return to interphase. Calcineurin is required to break the deep cell cycle arrest imposed by the Mos-MAP (mitogen-activated protein) kinase pathway(4,5,9), and we show that Fizzy/Cdc20, a key regulator of the anaphase-promoting factor(6), is an excellent substrate for this phosphatase.","Imperial Canc Res Fund, Clare Hall Labs, London Res Ctr, Canc Res UK, S Mimms EN6 3LD, Herts, England","Hunt, T (reprint author), Imperial Canc Res Fund, Clare Hall Labs, London Res Ctr, Canc Res UK, S Mimms EN6 3LD, Herts, England.",tim.hunt@cancer.org.uk,,,,,,32,100,101,0,5,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Sep,2007,449,7160,,,,,336,+,,10.1038/nature06121,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,211XP,WOS:000249557300044,17882219.0,No,,,11/20/17,tim,hunt,male,0.99,2949,DuqqJoEAAAAJ,25121

In vertebrates, these responses include exit from metaphase arrest in meiosis II (MII exit) and cortical remodelling initiated by cortical granule exocytosis. Although the essential requirement of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II for inducing MII exit has been documented(3), a role of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin in egg activation has not been investigated. Here we show, using cell-free extracts from unfertilized eggs of Xenopus laevis, that calcineurin is transiently activated immediately after Ca2+ addition to a concentration that induces MII exit. When calcineurin activation is inhibited, cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) inactivation by means of cyclin B degradation is prevented and sperm chromatin incubated in the extracts remains condensed. Similarly, if calcineurin is inhibited in intact eggs, MII exit on egg activation is prevented. In addition, the activation contraction(4) in the cortex is suppressed whereas cortical granule exocytosis occurs. We further demonstrate that, when a high level of calcineurin activity is maintained after activation, growth of sperm asters is prevented in egg extracts and, consistently, migration of male and female pronuclei towards each other is hindered in fertilized eggs. Thus, both activation and the subsequent inactivation of calcineurin in fertilized eggs are crucial for the commencement of vertebrate embryonic development.","Tokyo Inst Technol, Grad Sch Biosci & Biotechnol, Lab Cell & Dev Biol, Midori Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2268501, Japan; Gifu Univ, Dept Anim Resource Product, United Grad Sch Agr Sci, Gifu 5011193, Japan","Ohsumi, K (reprint author), Tokyo Inst Technol, Grad Sch Biosci & Biotechnol, Lab Cell & Dev Biol, Midori Ku, 4259 Nagatsuta, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2268501, Japan.",kohsumi@bio.titech.ac.jp,,,,,,35,60,60,0,7,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Sep,2007,449,7160,,,,,341,+,,10.1038/nature06136,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,211XP,WOS:000249557300045,17882220.0,No,,,11/20/17,keita,ohsumi,male,0.93,14,na,na

However, the lack of specific surface markers has hampered identification and tracking of the unrecognized subset of germ cells that gives rise to multipotent cells(2). Although embryonic-like cells can be derived from adult testis cultures after only several weeks in vitro(1), it is not known whether adult self-renewing spermatogonia in long-term culture can generate such stem cells as well. Here, we show that highly proliferative adult spermatogonial progenitor cells (SPCs) can be efficiently obtained by cultivation on mitotically inactivated testicular feeders containing CD34(+) stromal cells. SPCs exhibit testicular repopulating activity in vivo and maintain the ability in long-term culture to give rise to multipotent adult spermatogonial-derived stem cells (MASCs). Furthermore, both SPCs and MASCs express GPR125, an orphan adhesion-type G-protein-coupled receptor. In knock-in mice bearing a GPR125-beta-galactosidase (LacZ) fusion protein under control of the native Gpr125 promoter (GPR125-LacZ), expression in the testis was detected exclusively in spermatogonia and not in differentiated germ cells. Primary GPR125-LacZ SPC lines retained GPR125 expression, underwent clonal expansion, maintained the phenotype of germline stem cells, and reconstituted spermatogenesis in busulphan-treated mice. Long-term cultures of GPR125(+) SPCs (GSPCs) also converted into GPR125(+) MASC colonies. GPR125(+) MASCs generated derivatives of the three germ layers and contributed to chimaeric embryos, with concomitant downregulation of GPR125 during differentiation into GPR125(+) cells. MASCs also differentiated into contractile cardiac tissue in vitro and formed functional blood vessels in vivo. Molecular bookmarking by GPR125 in the adult mouse and, ultimately, in the human testis could enrich for a population of SPCs for derivation of GPR125(+) MASCs, which may be employed for genetic manipulation, tissue regeneration and revascularization of ischaemic organs.","Weill Cornell Med Coll, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Med Genet, New York, NY 10065 USA; Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Urol, New York, NY 10065 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Beth Israel Deaconess Canc Ctr, Canc Genet Program, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Regeneron Pharmaceut Inc, Tarrytown, NY 10591 USA; Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Pathol, Canc Biol & Genet Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Div Med Oncol, Dept Med, New York, NY 10065 USA","Rafii, S (reprint author), Weill Cornell Med Coll, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Med Genet, New York, NY 10065 USA.",srafii@med.cornell.edu,,"Murphy, Andrew/0000-0003-4152-4081; Hobbs, Robin/0000-0002-3853-2614","Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NEI NIH HHS [K08 EY021171]; NHLBI NIH HHS [R01 HL061849-05, P01 HL059312, P01 HL059312-060006, P01 HL059312-070006, P01 HL059312-080006, P01 HL059312-090006, P01 HL059312-100006, P01 HL067839, P01 HL067839-010004, P01 HL067839-020004, P01 HL067839-030004, P01 HL067839-040004, P01 HL067839-050004, P50 HL084936, P50 HL084936-010003, P50 HL084936-020003, P50 HL084936-030003, P50 HL084936-040003, R01 HL058707, R01 HL058707-03, R01 HL058707-04, R01 HL061849, R01 HL061849-02, R01 HL061849-03, R01 HL061849-03S1, R01 HL061849-04, R01 HL075234, R01 HL075234-01, R01 HL075234-02, R01 HL075234-03, R01 HL075234-04, R01 HL097797, R01 HL097797-01, R01 HL097797-02, R01 HL097797-03, R21 HL083222, R21 HL083222-01, R21 HL083222-02, U01 HL066952, U01 HL066952-010002, U01 HL066952-020002, U01 HL066952-030002, U01 HL066952-040002, U01 HL066952-050002]",,,32,275,296,2,19,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Sep,2007,449,7160,,,,,346,+,,10.1038/nature06129,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,211XP,WOS:000249557300046,17882221.0,No,,,11/20/17,shahin,rafii,male,0.76,21,na,na

The signalling events that distinguish between these two proliferative neural cell types remain poorly understood. The Notch signalling pathway is known to maintain NSC character and to inhibit neurogenesis, although little is known about the role of Notch signalling in INPs. Here we show that both NSCs and INPs respond to Notch receptor activation, but that NSCs signal through the canonical Notch effector C-promoter binding factor 1 (CBF1), whereas INPs have attenuated CBF1 signalling. Furthermore, whereas knock-down of CBF1 promotes the conversion of NSCs to INPs, activation of CBF1 is insufficient to convert INPs back to NSCs. Using both transgenic and transient in vivo reporter assays we show that NSCs and INPs coexist in the telencephalic ventricular zone and that they can be prospectively separated on the basis of CBF1 activity. Furthermore, using in vivo transplantation we show that whereas NSCs generate neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes at similar frequencies, INPs are predominantly neurogenic. Together with previous work on haematopoietic stem cells(4), this study suggests that the use or blockade of the CBF1 cascade downstream of Notch is a general feature distinguishing stem cells from more limited progenitors in a variety of tissues.","Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Inst Cell Engn, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Gaiano, N (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Inst Cell Engn, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",gaiano@jhmi.edu,,,,,,29,303,315,2,14,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Sep,2007,449,7160,,,,,351,+,,10.1038/nature06090,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,211XP,WOS:000249557300047,17721509.0,No,,,11/20/17,nicholas,gaiano,male,1,1176,na,na

Robust cycling of key clock elements is required to maintain strong circadian oscillations of these clock-controlled outputs. Rhythmic expression of the Arabidopsis thaliana F-box protein ZEITLUPE (ZTL) is necessary to sustain a normal circadian period by controlling the proteasome-dependent degradation of a central clock protein, TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1 (TOC1)(1,2). ZTL messenger RNA is constitutively expressed, but ZTL protein levels oscillate with a threefold change in amplitude through an unknown mechanism(3). Here we show that GIGANTEA (GI) is essential to establish and sustain oscillations of ZTL by a direct protein-protein interaction. GI, a large plant-specific protein with a previously undefined molecular role, stabilizes ZTL in vivo. Furthermore, the ZTL-GI interaction is strongly and specifically enhanced by blue light, through the amino-terminal flavin-binding LIGHT, OXYGEN OR VOLTAGE (LOV) domain of ZTL. Mutations within this domain greatly diminish ZTL-GI interactions, leading to strongly reduced ZTL levels. Notably, a C82A mutation in the LOV domain, implicated in the flavin-dependent photochemistry, eliminates blue-light-enhanced binding of GI to ZTL. These data establish ZTL as a blue-light photoreceptor, which facilitates its own stability through a blue-light-enhanced GI interaction. Because the regulation of GI transcription is clock-controlled, consequent GI protein cycling confers a post-translational rhythm on ZTL protein. This mechanism of establishing and sustaining robust oscillations of ZTL results in the high-amplitude TOC1 rhythms necessary for proper clock function.","Ohio State Univ, Dept Plant Cellular & Mol Biol, Ctr Plant Biotechnol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; Gyeongsang Natl Univ, BK21 Program, Environm Biotechnol Natl Core Res Ctr, Jinju 660701, South Korea; Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Life Sci, Pohang 790784, Kyungbuk, South Korea; Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Auckland 1, New Zealand","Somers, DE (reprint author), Ohio State Univ, Dept Plant Cellular & Mol Biol, Ctr Plant Biotechnol, 054 Rightmire Hall,1060 Carmack Rd, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",somers.24@osu.edu,"Somers, David/A-9209-2010","David, Karine/0000-0002-3924-5078; Kim, Jeongsik/0000-0002-2729-6003",,,,33,278,297,10,61,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Sep,2007,449,7160,,,,,356,+,,10.1038/nature06132,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,211XP,WOS:000249557300048,17704763.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,david e.,somers,na,na,na,na,na

TGF-beta is secreted by cells as an inactive precursor that must be activated to exert biological effects(4), but the mechanisms that regulate TGF-beta activation and function in the immune system are poorly understood. Here we show that conditional loss of the TGF-beta-activating integrin alpha(v)beta(8) on leukocytes causes severe inflammatory bowel disease and age-related autoimmunity in mice. This autoimmune phenotype is largely due to lack of alpha(v)beta(8) on dendritic cells, as mice lacking alpha(v)beta(8) principally on dendritic cells develop identical immunological abnormalities as mice lacking alpha(v)beta(8) on all leukocytes, whereas mice lacking alpha(v)beta(8) on T cells alone are phenotypically normal. We further show that dendritic cells lacking alpha(v)beta(8) fail to induce regulatory T cells (T-R cells) in vitro, an effect that depends on TGF-beta activity. Furthermore, mice lacking alpha(v)beta(8) on dendritic cells have reduced proportions of T-R cells in colonic tissue. These results suggest that alpha(v)beta(8)-mediated TGF-beta activation by dendritic cells is essential for preventing immune dysfunction that results in inflammatory bowel disease and autoimmunity, effects that are due, at least in part, to the ability of alpha(v)beta(8) on dendritic cells to induce and/or maintain tissue T-R cells.","Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Med, Lung Biol Ctr, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; Columbia Univ, Dept Microbiol, New York, NY 10032 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Med, Ctr Diabet, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Physiol, Howard Hughes Med Inst, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA","Sheppard, D (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Med, Lung Biol Ctr, 1550 4th St,Room 545, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA.",dean.sheppard@ucsf.edu,"Travis, Mark/E-9643-2015","Travis, Mark/0000-0002-8485-2272; Reizis, Boris/0000-0003-1140-7853","NINDS NIH HHS [R01 NS019090, R01 NS019090-25]",,,30,291,298,0,38,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Sep,2007,449,7160,,,,,361,+,,10.1038/nature06110,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,211XP,WOS:000249557300049,17694047.0,No,,,11/20/17,dean,sheppard,male,0.96,914,UT3_bnIAAAAJ,30308

Under fasting conditions, FOXO1 increases gluconeogenic gene expression in concert with the cAMP responsive coactivator TORC2 (refs 4-8). In response to pancreatic glucagon, TORC2 is de-phosphorylated at Ser 171 and transported to the nucleus, in which it stimulates the gluconeogenic programme by binding to CREB. Here we show in mice that insulin inhibits gluconeogenic gene expression during re-feeding by promoting the phosphorylation and ubiquitin-dependent degradation of TORC2. Insulin disrupts TORC2 activity by induction of the Ser/Thr kinase SIK2, which we show here undergoes AKT2-mediated phosphorylation at Ser 358. Activated SIK2 in turn stimulated the Ser 171 phosphorylation and cytoplasmic translocation of TORC2. Phosphorylated TORC2 was degraded by the 26S proteasome during re-feeding through an association with COP1, a substrate receptor for an E3 ligase complex that promoted TORC2 ubiquitination at Lys 628. Because TORC2 protein levels and activity were increased in diabetes owing to a block in TORC2 phosphorylation, our results point to an important role for this pathway in the maintenance of glucose homeostasis.","Salk Inst Biol Studies, Peptide Biol Labs, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; Sungkyunkwan Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Suwon 440746, South Korea; Scripps Res Inst, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Montminy, M (reprint author), Salk Inst Biol Studies, Peptide Biol Labs, 10010 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",montminy@salk.edu,"Koo, Seung-Hoi/E-2763-2015; dentin, Renaud/P-4939-2017","Koo, Seung-Hoi/0000-0001-8769-2879; ",,,,23,232,244,0,33,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,20-Sep,2007,449,7160,,,,,366,+,,10.1038/nature06128,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,211XP,WOS:000249557300050,17805301.0,No,,,11/20/17,marc,montminy,male,1,1555,na,na

Most of them orbit main-sequence stars similar to our Sun, although a few planets orbiting red giant stars have been recently found(3). When the hydrogen in their cores runs out, main-sequence stars undergo an expansion into red-giant stars. This expansion can modify the orbits of planets and can easily reach and engulf the inner planets. The same will happen to the planets of our Solar System in about five billion years and the fate of the Earth is matter of debate(4,5). Here we report the discovery of a planetary-mass body (Msini = 3.2M(Jupiter)) orbiting the star V 391 Pegasi at a distance of about 1.7 astronomical units (AU), with a period of 3.2 years. This star is on the extreme horizontal branch of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, burning helium in its core and pulsating. The maximum radius of the red-giant precursor of V 391 Pegasi may have reached 0.7 AU, while the orbital distance of the planet during the stellar main-sequence phase is estimated to be about 1 AU.

The geographic extent of the subsurface ice found poleward of approximately +/-60 degrees latitude on both hemispheres of Mars(7-9) coincides with the areas where ice is stable(7,10,11). However, the tilt of Mars' rotation axis (obliquity) changed considerably in the past several million years. Earlier work(3,12) has shown that regions of ice stability, which are defined by temperature and atmospheric humidity, differed in the recent past from today's, and subsurface ice is expected to retreat quickly when unstable(11-13). Here I explain how the subsurface ice sheets could have evolved to the state in which we see them today. Simulations of the retreat and growth of ground ice as a result of sublimation loss and recharge reveal forty major ice ages over the past five million years. Today, this gives rise to pore ice at mid-latitudes and a three-layered depth distribution in the high latitudes of, from top to bottom, a dry layer, pore ice, and a massive ice sheet. Combined, these layers provide enough ice to be compatible with existing neutron and gamma-ray measurements(7-9).","Univ Hawaii, Inst Astron, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; Univ Hawaii, NASA, Astrobiol Inst, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA","Schorghofer, N (reprint author), Univ Hawaii, Inst Astron, 2680 Woodlawn Dr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",norbert@hawaii.edu,,,,,,25,60,61,0,10,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,13-Sep,2007,449,7159,,,,,192,U2,,10.1038/nature06082,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,209NF,WOS:000249394500043,17851518.0,No,,,11/20/17,norbert,schorghofer,male,1,77,pjJENOsAAAAJ,1576

P., Jr.",,,The production of molecular positronium,NATURE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ANNIHILATION; SURFACES; PULSES,"It has been known for many years that an electron and its antiparticle, the positron, may together form a metastable hydrogen-like atom, known as positronium or Ps (ref. 1). In 1946, Wheeler speculated(2) that two Ps atoms may combine to form the dipositronium molecule (Ps(2)), with a binding energy(3) of 0.4 eV. More recently, this molecule has been studied theoretically(4); however, because Ps has a short lifetime and it is difficult to obtain low-energy positrons in large numbers, Ps(2) has not previously been observed unambiguously(5). Here we show that when intense positron bursts are implanted into a thin film of porous silica, Ps(2) is created on the internal pore surfaces. We found that molecule formation occurs much more efficiently than the competing process of spin exchange quenching, which appears to be suppressed in the confined pore geometry. This result experimentally confirms the existence of the Ps(2) molecule and paves the way for further multi-positronium work. Using similar techniques, but with a more intense positron source, we expect to increase the Ps density to the point where many thousands of atoms interact and can undergo a phase transition to form a Bose-Einstein condensate(6). As a purely leptonic, macroscopic quantum matter-antimatter system this would be of interest in its own right, but it would also represent a milestone on the path to produce an annihilation gamma-ray laser(7).","Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Phys & Astron, Riverside, CA 92521 USA","Cassidy, DB (reprint author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Phys & Astron, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",cassidy@physics.ucr.edu,,"Cassidy, David/0000-0001-8332-5553",,,,29,165,166,0,37,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,13-Sep,2007,449,7159,,,,,195,197,,10.1038/nature06094,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,209NF,WOS:000249394500044,17851519.0,No,,,11/20/17,a. p.,mills,na,na,na,na,na

Given that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, it has been proposed that surface temperatures were significantly higher during the earlier portions of the Palaeozoic era(1). A reconstruction of tropical sea surface temperatures based on the delta O-18 of carbonate fossils indicates, however, that the magnitude of temperature variability throughout this period was small(4), suggesting that global climate may be independent of variations in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. Here we present estimates of sea surface temperatures that were obtained from fossil brachiopod and mollusc shells using the 'carbonate clumped isotope' method(5)-an approach that, unlike the delta O-18 method, does not require independent estimates of the isotopic composition of the Palaeozoic ocean. Our results indicate that tropical sea surface temperatures were significantly higher than today during the Early Silurian period (443-423 Myr ago), when carbon dioxide concentrations are thought to have been relatively high, and were broadly similar to today during the Late Carboniferous period (314-300 Myr ago), when carbon dioxide concentrations are thought to have been similar to the present-day value.

The area of preserved crust diminishes markedly with age(1,2), and this can be interpreted as being the result of either the progressive accumulation of new crust(3) or the tectonic recycling of old crust(4). However, there is a disproportionate amount of crust of certain ages(1,2), with the main peaks being 1.2, 1.9, 2.7 and 3.3 billion years old; this has led to a third model in which the crust has grown through time in pulses(1,2,5-7), although peaks in continental crust ages could also record preferential preservation. The Re-187-Os-187 decay system is unique in its ability to track melt depletion events within the mantle and could therefore potentially link the crust and mantle differentiation records. Here we employ a laser ablation technique to analyse large numbers of osmium alloy grains to quantify the distribution of depletion ages in the Earth's upper mantle. Statistical analysis of these data, combined with other samples of the upper mantle, show that depletion ages are not evenly distributed but cluster in distinct periods, around 1.2, 1.9 and 2.7 billion years. These mantle depletion events coincide with peaks in the generation of continental crust and so provide evidence of coupled, global and pulsed mantle crust differentiation, lending strong support to pulsed models of continental growth by means of large-scale mantle melting events(6).","Univ Durham, Dept Earth Sci, No Ctr Isotop & Elemental Tracing, Durham DH1 4QE, England","Pearson, DG (reprint author), Univ Durham, Dept Earth Sci, No Ctr Isotop & Elemental Tracing, South Rd, Durham DH1 4QE, England.",d.g.pearson@durham.ac.uk,,"Parman, Stephen/0000-0002-7523-8684",,,,30,127,134,2,42,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Sep,2007,449,7159,,,,,202,205,,10.1038/nature06122,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,209NF,WOS:000249394500046,17851521.0,No,,,11/20/17,g. m.,nowell,na,na,na,na,na

Here we present an alternative approach, in which C-14 dates of interest are mapped directly onto the palaeoclimate record of the Cariaco Basin by means of its C-14 series(3), circumventing calendar age model and correlation uncertainties, and placing dated events in the millennial-scale climate context of the last glacial period. This is applied to different sets of dates from levels with Mousterian artefacts, presumably produced by late Neanderthals, from Gorham's Cave in Gibraltar: first, generally accepted estimates of about 32,000 C-14 years BP for the upper-most Mousterian levels(4,5); second, a possible extended Middle Palaeolithic occupation until about 28,000 C-14 years BP6; and third, more contentious evidence for persistence until about 24,000 C-14 years BP6. This study shows that the three sets translate to different scenarios on the role of climate in Neanderthal extinction. The first two correspond to intervals of general climatic instability between stadials and interstadials that characterized most of the Middle Pleniglacial and are not coeval with Heinrich Events. In contrast, if accepted, the youngest date indicates that late Neanderthals may have persisted up to the onset of a major environmental shift, which included an expansion in global ice volume and an increased latitudinal temperature gradient. More generally, our radiocarbon climatostratigraphic approach can be applied to any 'snapshot' date from discontinuous records in a variety of deposits and can become a powerful tool in evaluating the climatic signature of critical intervals in Late Pleistocene human evolution.","Univ Leeds, Sch Geog, Earth & Biosphere Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; Univ Aegean, Dept Environm, Mitilini 81100, Greece; Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Marine Chem & Geochem, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; Univ Barcelona, GRC Marine Geosci, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Anthropol, Dept Human Evolut, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany","Tzedakis, PC (reprint author), Univ Leeds, Sch Geog, Earth & Biosphere Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",p.c.tzedakis@leeds.ac.uk,"Cacho, Isabel/H-4402-2013; Harvati, Katerina/A-5197-2008; Rohlf, F/A-8710-2008; Tzedakis, Polychronis/J-1894-2012","Cacho, Isabel/0000-0002-6512-0770; Tzedakis, Polychronis/0000-0001-6072-1166; ",,,,27,58,58,2,56,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,13-Sep,2007,449,7159,,,,,206,208,,10.1038/nature06117,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,209NF,WOS:000249394500047,17851522.0,No,,,11/20/17,k.,harvati,na,na,na,na,na

These models of self-organization suggest that characteristic patterns should exist across a broad range of environmental conditions provided that local interactions do indeed dominate the development of community structure. Readily available observations that could be used to support these theoretical expectations, however, have lacked sufficient spatial extent or the necessary diversity of environmental conditions to confirm the model predictions. We use high-resolution satellite imagery to document the prevalence of self-organized vegetation patterns across a regional rainfall gradient in southern Africa, where percent tree cover ranges from 65% to 4%. Through the application of a cellular automata model, we find that the observed power-law distributions of tree canopy cluster sizes can arise from the interacting effects of global-scale resource constraints (that is, water availability) and local-scale facilitation. Positive local feedbacks result in power-law distributions without entailing threshold behaviour commonly associated with criticality.

Discontinuous transitions are abrupt, irreversible and among the most catastrophic changes of ecosystems identified(1). For terrestrial ecosystems, it has been hypothesized that vegetation patchiness could be used as a signature of imminent transitions(3,4). Here, we analyse how vegetation patchiness changes in arid ecosystems with different grazing pressures, using both field data and a modelling approach. In the modelling approach, we extrapolated our analysis to even higher grazing pressures to investigate the vegetation patchiness when desertification is imminent. In three arid Mediterranean ecosystems in Spain, Greece and Morocco, we found that the patch-size distribution of the vegetation follows a power law. Using a stochastic cellular automaton model, we show that local positive interactions among plants can explain such power-law distributions. Furthermore, with increasing grazing pressure, the field data revealed consistent deviations from power laws. Increased grazing pressure leads to similar deviations in the model. When grazing was further increased in the model, we found that these deviations always and only occurred close to transition to desert, independent of the type of transition, and regardless of the vegetation cover. Therefore, we propose that patch-size distributions may be a warning signal for the onset of desertification.","Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst, Dept Environm Sci, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; Pyrenean Inst Ecol, Zaragoza 50192, Spain; Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Lab Rangeland Ecol, Thessaloniki 54006, Greece; Inst Agron & Vet Hassan II, Dept Anim Prod, Rabat, Morocco; Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Soil Ctr, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands","Kefi, S (reprint author), Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst, Dept Environm Sci, POB 80115, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",kefi@geo.uu.nl,"Rietkerk, Max/H-6235-2011; Alados, Concepcion/K-8085-2014; Pueyo, Yolanda/I-4248-2015","Alados, Concepcion/0000-0002-6227-861X; Pueyo, Yolanda/0000-0001-6970-7790; Rietkerk, Max/0000-0002-2698-3848; Kefi, Sonia/0000-0002-9678-7770",,,,30,402,421,18,282,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Sep,2007,449,7159,,,,,213,U5,,10.1038/nature06111,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,209NF,WOS:000249394500049,17851524.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,peter c.,de ruiter,na,na,na,na,na

However, a general mechanistic theory showing how traits specifically influence carbon and biomass flux within and across plants is needed. Building on foundational work on relative growth rate(4-6), recent work on functional trait spectra(7-9), and metabolic scaling theory(10,11), here we derive a generalized trait-based model of plant growth. In agreement with a wide variety of empirical data, our model uniquely predicts how key functional traits interact to regulate variation in relative growth rate, the allometric growth normalizations for both angiosperms and gymnosperms, and the quantitative form of several functional trait spectra relationships. The model also provides a general quantitative framework to incorporate additional leaf-level trait scaling relationships(7,8) and hence to unite functional trait spectra with theories of relative growth rate, and metabolic scaling. We apply the model to calculate carbon use efficiency. This often ignored trait, which may influence variation in relative growth rate, appears to vary directionally across geographic gradients. Together, our results show how both quantitative plant traits and the geometry of vascular transport networks can be merged into a common scaling theory. Our model provides a framework for predicting not only how traits covary within an integrated allometric phenotype but also how trait variation mechanistically influences plant growth and carbon flux within and across diverse ecosystems.","Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA; Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA; Sci Conservat Int, Ctr Appl Biodivers, Arlington, VA 22202 USA; Kenyon Coll, Dept Biol, Gambier, OH 43022 USA; Kenyon Coll, Dept Math, Gambier, OH 43022 USA","Enquist, BJ (reprint author), Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA.",benquist@email.arizona.edu,"Price, Charles/B-1171-2011; Swenson, Nathan/A-3514-2012","Swenson, Nathan/0000-0003-3819-9767; Enquist, Brian/0000-0002-6124-7096",,,,31,98,110,4,105,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Sep,2007,449,7159,,,,,218,222,,10.1038/nature06061,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,209NF,WOS:000249394500050,17851525.0,No,,,11/20/17,charles a.,price,na,na,na,na,na

These ectodomains show isoform-specific homophilic binding, leading to speculation that Dscam proteins mediate cell recognition(2). Genetic studies have established that Dscam is required for neural circuit assembly(1,3-10), but the extent to which isoform diversity contributes to this process is not known. Here we provide conclusive evidence that Dscam diversity is essential for circuit assembly. Using homologous recombination, we reduced the entire repertoire of Dscam ectodomains to just a single isoform. Neural circuits in these mutants are severely disorganized. Furthermore, we show that it is crucial for neighbouring neurons to express distinct isoforms, but that the specific identity of the isoforms expressed in an individual neuron is unimportant. We conclude that Dscam diversity provides each neuron with a unique identity by which it can distinguish its own processes from those of other neurons, and that this self-recognition is essential for wiring the Drosophila brain.","Univ Calif Los Angeles, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biol Chem, David Geffen Sch Med, Los Angeles, CA 90049 USA; Inst Mol Pathol, A-1030 Vienna, Austria","Zipursky, SL (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Biol Chem, David Geffen Sch Med, Los Angeles, CA 90049 USA.",lzipursky@mednet.ucla.edu; dickson@imp.ac.at,"Marion-Poll, Frederic/D-8882-2011","Marion-Poll, Frederic/0000-0001-6824-0180",Howard Hughes Medical Institute,,,28,122,124,1,8,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Sep,2007,449,7159,,,,,223,U6,,10.1038/nature06099,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,209NF,WOS:000249394500051,17851526.0,No,,,11/20/17,barry j.,dickson,na,na,na,na,na

Similar to insulin secretion by pancreatic beta-cells(1), glucose excitation of neurons is driven by ATP-mediated closure of ATP-sensitive potassium (K-ATP) channels(2-5). Although beta-cell-like glucose sensing in neurons is well established, its physiological relevance and contribution to disease states such as type 2 diabetes remain unknown. To address these issues, we disrupted glucose sensing in glucose-excited pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons(5) via transgenic expression of a mutant Kir6.2 subunit (encoded by the Kcnj11 gene) that prevents ATP-mediated closure of K-ATP channels(6,7). Here we show that this genetic manipulation impaired the whole-body response to a systemic glucose load, demonstrating a role for glucose sensing by POMC neurons in the overall physiological control of blood glucose. We also found that glucose sensing by POMC neurons became defective in obese mice on a high-fat diet, suggesting that loss of glucose sensing by neurons has a role in the development of type 2 diabetes. The mechanism for obesity-induced loss of glucose sensing in POMC neurons involves uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), a mitochondrial protein that impairs glucose-stimulated ATP production(8). UCP2 negatively regulates glucose sensing in POMC neurons. We found that genetic deletion of Ucp2 prevents obesity-induced loss of glucose sensing, and that acute pharmacological inhibition of UCP2 reverses loss of glucose sensing. We conclude that obesity-induced, UCP2-mediated loss of glucose sensing in glucose-excited neurons might have a pathogenic role in the development of type 2 diabetes.","Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Div Neurosci, Oregon Natl Primate Res Ctr, Beaverton, OR 97006 USA; Nanjing Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Pharmaceut Biotechnol, Nanjing 210093, Peoples R China; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA; Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Dept Med, Div Endocrinol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; Univ Texas, SW Med Ctr, Dept Internal Med, Ctr Hypothalam Res, Dallas, TX 75390 USA","Cowley, MA (reprint author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Div Neurosci, Oregon Natl Primate Res Ctr, 505 NW 185th Ave, Beaverton, OR 97006 USA.",cowleym@ohsu.edu; blowell@bidmc.harvard.edu,"vianna, claudia /I-4991-2012; Coppari, Roberto/B-4799-2014","Enriori, Pablo/0000-0003-1309-2875; Cowley, Michael/0000-0001-7811-134X",NIDDK NIH HHS [R37 DK053477],,,30,353,361,2,54,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Sep,2007,449,7159,,,,,228,U7,,10.1038/nature06098,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,209NF,WOS:000249394500052,17728716.0,No,,,11/20/17,bradford b.,lowell,na,na,na,na,na

Here we use a combination of solution NMR, amide hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange and mutagenesis to study the structural differences between two strain conformations, termed Sc4 and Sc37 (ref. 5), of the yeast Sup35 prion. We find that these two strains have an overlapping amyloid core spanning most of the Gln/Asn-rich first 40 amino acids that is highly protected from H/D exchange and very sensitive to mutation. These features indicate that the cores are composed of tightly packed beta-sheets possibly resembling 'steric zipper' structures revealed by X-ray crystallography of Sup35-derived peptides(6,7). The stable structure is greatly expanded in the Sc37 conformation to encompass the first 70 amino acids, revealing why this strain shows increased fibre stability and decreased ability to undergo chaperone-mediated replication(8). Our findings establish that prion strains involve large-scale conformational differences and provide a structural basis for understanding a broad range of functional studies, including how conformational changes alter the physiological impact of prion strains.","Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Cellular & Mol Pharmacol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pharmaceut Chem, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; Calif Inst Quantitat biomed Res, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA","Weissman, JS (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Cellular & Mol Pharmacol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA.",weissman@cmp.ucsf.edu,,,,,,36,214,215,0,16,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Sep,2007,449,7159,,,,,233,U8,,10.1038/nature06108,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,209NF,WOS:000249394500053,17767153.0,No,,,11/20/17,jonathan s.,weissman,na,na,na,na,na

Stem cells are also proposed to retain DNA labels, such as 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU), either because they segregate chromosomes asymmetrically or because they divide slowly(5,7-9). However, the purity of stem cells among BrdU-label-retaining cells has not been documented in any tissue, and the 'immortal strand hypothesis' has not been tested in a system with definitive stem cell markers. Here we tested these hypotheses in haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which can be highly purified using well characterized markers. We administered BrdU to newborn mice, mice treated with cyclophosphamide and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and normal adult mice for 4 to 10 days, followed by 70 days without BrdU. In each case, less than 6% of HSCs retained BrdU and less than 0.5% of all BrdU-retaining haematopoietic cells were HSCs, revealing that BrdU has poor specificity and poor sensitivity as an HSC marker. Sequential administration of 5-chloro-2-deoxyuridine and 5-iodo-2-deoxyuridine indicated that all HSCs segregate their chromosomes randomly. Division of individual HSCs in culture revealed no asymmetric segregation of the label. Thus, HSCs cannot be identified on the basis of BrdU-label retention and do not retain older DNA strands during division, indicating that these are not general properties of stem cells.","Univ Michigan, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Inst Life Sci, Dept Internal Med, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ Michigan, Ctr Stem Cell Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ Michigan, Dept Math, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ Penn, Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Sch Med, Div Endocrinol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Morrison, SJ (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Inst Life Sci, Dept Internal Med, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",seanjm@umich.edu,,"He, Shenghui/0000-0001-8842-7137; Kushner, Jake A/0000-0002-3646-1744; Morrison, Sean/0000-0003-1587-8329","NIA NIH HHS [R01 AG024945-05, R01 AG024945, R01 AG024945-01, R01 AG024945-02, R01 AG024945-03, R01 AG024945-03S1, R01 AG024945-04]",,,22,255,266,0,14,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Sep,2007,449,7159,,,,,238,U10,,10.1038/nature06115,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,209NF,WOS:000249394500054,17728714.0,No,,,11/20/17,sean j.,morrison,na,na,na,na,na

However, plants have evolved a sophisticated immune system to detect these effectors using cognate disease resistance proteins(1), a recognition that is highly specific, often elicits rapid and localized cell death, known as a hypersensitive response, and thus potentially limits pathogen growth(2-5). Despite numerous genetic and biochemical studies on the interactions between pathogen effector proteins and plant resistance proteins, the structural bases for such interactions remain elusive. The direct interaction between the tomato protein kinase Pto and the Pseudomonas syringae effector protein AvrPto is known to trigger disease resistance and programmed cell death(6,7) through the nucleotide-binding site/leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) class of disease resistance protein Prf(8). Here we present the crystal structure of an AvrPto-Pto complex. Contrary to the widely held hypothesis that AvrPto activates Pto kinase activity, our structural and biochemical analyses demonstrated that AvrPto is an inhibitor of Pto kinase in vitro. The AvrPto-Pto interaction is mediated by the phosphorylation-stabilized P+1 loop and a second loop in Pto, both of which negatively regulate the Prf-mediated defences in the absence of AvrPto in tomato plants. Together, our results show that AvrPto derepresses host defences by interacting with the two defence-inhibition loops of Pto.","Natl Inst Biol Sci, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China; Tsinghua Univ, Dept Biol Sci & Biotechnol, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; Cornell Univ, Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Genet & Dev Biol, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Biophys, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Chai, JJ (reprint author), Natl Inst Biol Sci, No 7 Sci Pk Rd, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China.",chaijijie@nibs.ac.cn,"Xing, Weiman/G-5697-2010; Liu, Qun/A-8757-2011; Hao, Quan/C-4304-2009","Liu, Qun/0000-0002-1179-290X; ",,,,29,112,121,0,49,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,13-Sep,2007,449,7159,,,,,243,U11,,10.1038/nature06109,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,209NF,WOS:000249394500055,17694048.0,No,,,11/20/17,jijie,chai,na,na,na,na,na

DNA methyltransferase 3a (Dnmt3a) and its regulatory factor, DNA methyltransferase 3-like protein (Dnmt3L), are both required for the de novo DNA methylation of imprinted genes in mammalian germ cells. Dnmt3L interacts specifically with unmethylated lysine 4 of histone H3 through its amino-terminal PHD (plant homeodomain)-like domain(2). Here we show, with the use of crystallography, that the carboxy-terminal domain of human Dnmt3L interacts with the catalytic domain of Dnmt3a, demonstrating that Dnmt3L has dual functions of binding the unmethylated histone tail and activating DNA methyltransferase. The complexed C-terminal domains of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3L showed further dimerization through Dnmt3a-Dnmt3a interaction, forming a tetrameric complex with two active sites. Substitution of key non-catalytic residues at the Dnmt3a-Dnmt3L interface or the Dnmt3a-Dnmt3a interface eliminated enzymatic activity. Molecular modelling of a DNA Dnmt3a dimer indicated that the two active sites are separated by about one DNA helical turn. The C-terminal domain of Dnmt3a oligomerizes on DNA to form a nucleoprotein filament. A periodicity in the activity of Dnmt3a on long DNA revealed a correlation of methylated CpG sites at distances of eight to ten base pairs, indicating that oligomerization leads Dnmt3a to methylate DNA in a periodic pattern. A similar periodicity is observed for the frequency of CpG sites in the differentially methylated regions of 12 maternally imprinted mouse genes. These results suggest a basis for the recognition and methylation of differentially methylated regions in imprinted genes, involving the detection of both nucleosome modification and CpG spacing.","Jacobs Univ Bremen, Sch Sci & Engn, Biochem Lab, D-28759 Bremen, Germany; Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA","Jeltsch, A (reprint author), Jacobs Univ Bremen, Sch Sci & Engn, Biochem Lab, D-28759 Bremen, Germany.",a.jeltsch@jacobs-university.de; xcheng@emory.edu,"Jeltsch, Albert/O-7404-2014","Jeltsch, Albert/0000-0001-6113-9290","NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM049245, R01 GM049245-14]",,,30,422,441,3,57,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,13-Sep,2007,449,7159,,,,,248,U13,,10.1038/nature06146,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,209NF,WOS:000249394500056,17713477.0,No,,,11/20/17,xiaodong,cheng,male,1,1,fg3sXKwAAAAJ,14048

However, the general principles that govern this process are still largely unknown. With the growing number of sequenced genomes, it is now possible to examine these events in a comprehensive and unbiased manner. Here, we develop a procedure that resolves the evolutionary history of all genes in a large group of species. We apply our procedure to seventeen fungal genomes to create a genome-wide catalogue of gene trees that determine precise orthology and paralogy relations across these species. We show that gene duplication and loss is highly constrained by the functional properties and interacting partners of genes. In particular, stress-related genes exhibit many duplications and losses, whereas growth-related genes show selection against such changes. Whole- genome duplication circumvents this constraint and relaxes the dichotomy, resulting in an expanded functional scope of gene duplication. By characterizing the functional fate of duplicate genes we show that duplicated genes rarely diverge with respect to biochemical function, but typically diverge with respect to regulatory control. Surprisingly, paralogous modules of genes rarely arise, even after whole-genome duplication. Rather, gene duplication may drive the modularization of functional networks through specialization, thereby disentangling cellular systems.","MIT, Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; Harvard Univ, FAS, Ctr Syst Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel; MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Regev, A (reprint author), MIT, Broad Inst, 7 Cambridge Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",aregev@broad.mit.edu,"Friedman, Nir/H-9692-2012","Friedman, Nir/0000-0002-9678-3550",,,,62,384,391,2,51,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Sep,2007,449,7158,,,,,54,U36,,10.1038/nature06107,,11,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,207ED,WOS:000249233500034,17805289.0,No,,,11/20/17,aviv,regev,male,0.7,23,na,na

FAPP2 also possesses a glycolipid-transfer-protein homology domain. Here we show that human FAPP2 is a glucosylceramide-transfer protein that has a pivotal role in the synthesis of complex glycosphingolipids, key structural and signalling components of the plasma membrane. The requirement for FAPP2 makes the whole glycosphingolipid synthetic pathway sensitive to regulation by phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and ARF1. Thus, by coupling the synthesis of glycosphingolipids with their export to the cell surface, FAPP2 emerges as crucial in determining the lipid identity and composition of the plasma membrane.","Ist Ric Farmacol Mario Negri, Consorzio Mario Negri Sud, Dept Cell Biol & Oncol, I-66030 Chieti, Italy; Abo Akad Univ, Dept Biochem & Pharm, FI-20520 Turku, Finland; Med Univ S Carolina, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Charleston, SC 29425 USA; Univ Oxford, Dept Pharmacol, Oxford OX1 3QT, England","De Matteis, MA (reprint author), Ist Ric Farmacol Mario Negri, Consorzio Mario Negri Sud, Dept Cell Biol & Oncol, Via Nazl 8-A, I-66030 Chieti, Italy.",dematteis@negrisud.it,"Platt, Frances/G-1004-2010","DANGELO, GIOVANNI/0000-0001-5466-8709; DI CAMPLI, ANTONELLA/0000-0003-4504-5942; D'Angelo, Giovanni/0000-0002-0734-4127; Mattjus, Peter/0000-0001-8991-5933",Telethon [GGP06166],,,46,213,217,2,10,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Sep,2007,449,7158,,,,,62,U43,,10.1038/nature06097,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,207ED,WOS:000249233500035,17687330.0,No,,,11/20/17,maria antonietta,de matteis,female,1,8,na,na

Large-scale quantum information processors require stable and addressable quantum memories, usually in the form of fixed quantum bits ( qubits), and a means of transferring and entangling the quantum information between memories that may be separated by macroscopic or even geographic distances. Atomic systems are excellent quantum memories, because appropriate internal electronic states can coherently store qubits over very long timescales. Photons, on the other hand, are the natural platform for the distribution of quantum information between remote qubits, given their ability to traverse large distances with little perturbation. Recently, there has been considerable progress in coupling small samples of atomic gases through photonic channels(2,3), including the entanglement between light and atoms(4,5) and the observation of entanglement signatures between remotely located atomic ensembles(6) (-8). In contrast to atomic ensembles, single-atom quantum memories allow the implementation of conditional quantum gates through photonic channels2,9, a key requirement for quantum computing. Along these lines, individual atoms have been coupled to photons in cavities(2,10-12), and trapped atoms have been linked to emitted photons in free space(13-17). Here we demonstrate the entanglement of two fixed single-atom quantum memories separated by one metre. Two remotely located trapped atomic ions each emit a single photon, and the interference and detection of these photons signals the entanglement of the atomic qubits. We characterize the entangled pair by directly measuring qubit correlations with near-perfect detection efficiency. Although this entanglement method is probabilistic, it is still in principle useful for subsequent quantum operations and scalable quantum information applications(18-20).","Univ Michigan, FOCUS Ctr, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ Michigan, Dept Phys, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ Maryland, Dept Phys, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Moehring, DL (reprint author), Univ Michigan, FOCUS Ctr, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",david.moehring@mpq.mpg.de,"Matsukevich, Dzmitry/C-9134-2009; Olmschenk, Steven/D-4960-2011; Monroe, Christopher/G-8105-2011","Olmschenk, Steven/0000-0003-0105-7714; ",,,,33,367,371,5,47,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Sep,2007,449,7158,,,,,68,U48,,10.1038/nature06118,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,207ED,WOS:000249233500036,17805290.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,c.,monroe,male,1,1,9rrnu-0AAAAJ,31792

Solids with strongly correlated electrons, in which even subtle crystallographic distortions can result in colossal changes of the electronic and magnetic properties, could be directed between competing phases by such selective vibrational excitation. In this way, the dynamics of the electronic ground state of the system become accessible, and new insight into the underlying physics might be gained. Here we report the ultrafast switching of the electronic phase of a magnetoresistive manganite via direct excitation of a phonon mode at 71meV ( 17THz). A prompt, five-order-of-magnitude drop in resistivity is observed, associated with a non-equilibrium transition from the stable insulating phase to a metastable metallic phase. In contrast with light-induced(1-3) and current-driven(4) phase transitions, the vibrationally driven bandgap collapse observed here is not related to hot-carrier injection and is uniquely attributed to a large-amplitude Mn-O distortion. This corresponds to a perturbation of the perovskite-structure tolerance factor, which in turn controls the electronic bandwidth via inter-site orbital overlap(5,6). Phase control by coherent manipulation of selected metal-oxygen phonons should find extensive application in other complex solids-notably in copper oxide superconductors, in which the role of Cu-O vibrations on the electronic properties is currently controversial.

Here I show that similar indicators suggest a high potential for giant earthquakes along the coast of Myanmar. These indicators include the tectonic environment, which is similar to other subduction zones that experience giant megathrust earthquakes, stress and crustal strain observations, which indicate that the seismogenic zone is locked, and historical earthquake activity, which indicates that giant tsunamigenic earthquakes have occurred there in the past. These are all consistent with active subduction in the Myanmar subduction zone and I suggest that the seismogenic zone extends beneath the Bengal Fan. I conclude therefore that giant earthquakes probably occur off the coast of Myanmar, and that a large and vulnerable population is thereby exposed to a significant earthquake and tsunami hazard.","Geosci Australia, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia","Cummins, PR (reprint author), Geosci Australia, GPO Box 378, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",phil.cummins@ga.gov.au,,,,,,22,62,64,1,9,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Sep,2007,449,7158,,,,,75,78,,10.1038/nature06088,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,207ED,WOS:000249233500038,17805292.0,No,,,11/20/17,phil r.,cummins,na,na,na,na,na

Once captured, prey are carried by water movement inside the oral cavity to a second set of jaws in the throat, the pharyngeal jaws, which manipulate the prey and assist in swallowing(1,2). Moray eels display much less effective suction-feeding abilities(3). Given this reduction in a feeding mechanism that is widespread and highly conserved in aquatic vertebrates, it is not known how moray eels swallow large fish and cephalopods(4-7). Here we show that the moray eel (Muraena retifera) overcomes reduced suction capacity by launching raptorial pharyngeal jaws out of its throat and into its oral cavity, where the jaws grasp the struggling prey animal and transport it back to the throat and into the oesophagus. This is the first described case of a vertebrate using a second set of jaws to both restrain and transport prey, and is the only alternative to the hydraulic prey transport reported in teleost fishes. The extreme mobility of the moray pharyngeal jaws is made possible by elongation of the muscles that control the jaws(8), coupled with reduction of adjacent gill-arch structures(9). The discovery that pharyngeal jaws can reach up from behind the skull to grasp prey in the oral jaws reveals a major innovation that may have contributed to the success of moray eels as apex predators hunting within the complex matrix of coral reefs(10,11). This alternative prey transport mode is mechanically similar to the ratcheting mechanisms used in snakes(12,13)-a group of terrestrial vertebrates that share striking morphological, behavioural(14) and ecological convergence with moray eels.","Univ Calif Davis, Sect Evolut & Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Mehta, RS (reprint author), Univ Calif Davis, Sect Evolut & Ecol, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",rsmehta@ucdavis.edu,"Wainwright, Peter /A-7882-2013",,,,,30,33,34,2,59,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Sep,2007,449,7158,,,,,79,U53,,10.1038/nature06062,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,207ED,WOS:000249233500039,17805293.0,No,,,11/20/17,peter c.,wainwright,na,na,na,na,na

Phage-mediated transfer of host genes often located in genome islands-has had a major impact on microbial evolution(1,4,6). Furthermore, phage genomes have clearly been shaped by the acquisition of genes from their hosts(2,3,5). Here we investigate whole-genome expression of a host and phage, the marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus MED4 and the T7-like cyanophage P-SSP7, during lytic infection, to gain insight into these co-evolutionary processes. Although most of the phage genome was linearly transcribed over the course of infection, four phage-encoded bacterial metabolism genes formed part of the same expression cluster, even though they are physically separated on the genome. These genes-encoding photosystem II D1 ( psbA), high-light inducible protein (hli), transaldolase (talC) and ribonucleotide reductase (nrd)-are transcribed together with phage DNA replication genes and seem to make up a functional unit involved in energy and deoxynucleotide production for phage replication in resource-poor oceans. Also unique to this system was the upregulation of numerous genes in the host during infection. These may be host stress response genes and/or genes induced by the phage. Many of these host genes are located in genome islands and have homologues in cyanophage genomes. We hypothesize that phage have evolved to use upregulated host genes, leading to their stable incorporation into phage genomes and their subsequent transfer back to hosts in genome islands. Thus activation of host genes during infection may be directing the co-evolution of gene content in both host and phage genomes.","MIT, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; MIT, Dept Biol, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, BioPolymers Facil, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Humboldt Univ, Inst Theoret Biol, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; Univ Freiburg, Inst Biol, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany","Chisholm, SW (reprint author), MIT, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",chisholm@mit.edu,"Sullivan, Matthew/H-3256-2011","Sullivan, Matthew/0000-0003-4040-9831; Futschik, Matthias/0000-0002-6245-8071; Axmann, Ilka Maria/0000-0002-0856-8667; church, george/0000-0001-6232-9969",,,,25,153,166,5,50,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Sep,2007,449,7158,,,,,83,86,,10.1038/nature06130,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,207ED,WOS:000249233500040,17805294.0,No,,,11/20/17,sallie w.,chisholm,na,na,na,na,na

Each hair cell contains at the apical surface a bundle of stereocilia. Mechanoelectrical transduction takes place close to the tips of stereocilia in proximity to extracellular tip-link filaments that connect the stereocilia and are thought to gate the mechanoelectrical transduction channel(1-3). Recent reports on the composition(4-8), properties and function(9-11) of tip links are conflicting(29). Here we demonstrate that two cadherins that are linked to inherited forms of deafness in humans(12-15) interact to form tip links. Immunohistochemical studies using rodent hair cells show that cadherin 23 (CDH23) and protocadherin 15 (PCDH15) localize to the upper and lower part of tip links, respectively. The amino termini of the two cadherins co-localize on tip-link filaments. Biochemical experiments show that CDH23 homodimers interact in trans with PCDH15 homodimers to form a filament with structural similarity to tip links. Ions that affect tip-link integrity and a mutation in PCDH15 that causes a recessive form of deafness(16) disrupt interactions between CDH23 and PCDH15.

The existence of such precision contributes to a fundamental debate over the basis of the neural code and, specifically, what timescales are important for neural computation(8-10). Using recordings in the lateral geniculate nucleus, here we demonstrate that the relevant timescale of neuronal spike trains depends on the frequency content of the visual stimulus, and that 'relative', not absolute, precision is maintained both during spatially uniform white-noise visual stimuli and naturalistic movies. Using information-theoretic techniques, we demonstrate a clear role of relative precision, and show that the experimentally observed temporal structure in the neuronal response is necessary to represent accurately the more slowly changing visual world.

Asymmetric cell division provides one fundamental mechanism by which stem cell self-renewal and differentiation are balanced(1,2). A failure of this balance could lead to diseases such as cancer(3-6). During asymmetric division of stem cells, factors controlling their self-renewal and differentiation are unequally segregated between daughter cells. Numb is one such factor that is segregated to the differentiating daughter cell during the stem-cell-like neuroblast divisions in Drosophila melanogaster 7, where it inhibits self-renewal(8,9). The localization and function of Numb is cell-cycle-dependent(7,10-12). Here we show that Polo (ref. 13), a key cell cycle regulator, the mammalian counterparts of which have been implicated as oncogenes as well as tumour suppressors(14,15), acts as a tumour suppressor in the larval brain. Supernumerary neuroblasts are produced at the expense of neurons in polo mutants. Polo directly phosphorylates Partner of Numb (Pon, ref. 16), an adaptor protein for Numb, and this phosphorylation event is important for Pon to localize Numb. In polo mutants, the asymmetric localization of Pon, Numb and atypical protein kinase C are disrupted, whereas other polarity markers are largely unaffected. Overexpression of Numb suppresses neuroblast over-proliferation caused by polo mutations, suggesting that Numb has a major role in mediating this effect of Polo. Our results reveal a biochemical link between the cell cycle and the asymmetric protein localization machinery, and indicate that Polo can inhibit progenitor self-renewal by regulating the localization and function of Numb.","Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Geriatr Res Educ & Clin, VA Palo Alto Hlth Care Syst,Dept Pathol, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA; Natl Univ Singapore, Temasek Life Sci Lab, Singapore 117604, Singapore; Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Biol Sci, Singapore 117604, Singapore","Lu, BW (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Geriatr Res Educ & Clin, VA Palo Alto Hlth Care Syst,Dept Pathol, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA.",wchia@tll.org.sg; bingwei@stanford.edu,"Somers, Wayne/C-2638-2011","Yu, Fengwei/0000-0003-0268-199X; Wang, Hongyan/0000-0003-4623-1878","NINDS NIH HHS [R01 NS043167, R01 NS043167-01A1, R01 NS043167-02, R01 NS043167-03, R01 NS043167-04, R01 NS043167-05, R01 NS043167-06A1, R01 NS043167-07, R01 NS043167-08, R01 NS043167-09, R01 NS043167-10]",,,30,106,108,0,6,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Sep,2007,449,7158,,,,,96,U70,,10.1038/nature06056,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,207ED,WOS:000249233500043,17805297.0,No,,,11/20/17,bingwei,lu,na,na,na,na,na

Indeed, passively administered neutralizing antibodies have been shown to protect against HIV challenge in some of the best available animal models. For example, antibodies given intravenously can protect macaques against intravenous or mucosal SHIV (an HIV/SIV chimaera) challenge and topically applied antibodies can protect macaques against vaginal SHIV challenge(3,4). However, the mechanism(s) by which neutralizing antibodies afford protection against HIV is not understood and, in particular, the role of antibody Fc-mediated effector functions is unclear. Here we report that there is a dramatic decrease in the ability of a broadly neutralizing antibody to protect macaques against SHIV challenge when Fc receptor and complement-binding activities are engineered out of the antibody. No loss of antibody protective activity is associated with the elimination of complement binding alone. Our in vivo results are consistent with in vitro assays indicating that interaction of Fc-receptor-bearing effector cells with antibody-complexed infected cells is important in reducing virus yield from infected cells. Overall, the data suggest the potential importance of activity against both infected cells and free virus for effective protection against HIV.","Scripps Res Inst, Dept Immunol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; Scripps Res Inst, Dept Mol Biol, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; Tulane Univ, Tulane Natl Primate Res Ctr, Covington, LA 70433 USA; Genmab, NL-3584 CM Utrecht, Netherlands; Univ Calif Irvine, Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Infect Dis, Irvine, CA 92697 USA","Burton, DR (reprint author), Scripps Res Inst, Dept Immunol, 10666 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",burton@scripps.edu,"Hangartner, Lars/H-3503-2011","Parren, Paul/0000-0002-4365-3859",,,,30,474,483,2,14,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Sep,2007,449,7158,,,,,101,U75,,10.1038/nature06106,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,207ED,WOS:000249233500044,17805298.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,dennis r.,burton,na,na,na,na,na

Histone lysine methylation has recently been shown to be reversible; however, it is not known whether nonhistone proteins are substrates for demethylation. Here we show that, in human cells, the histone lysine-specific demethylase LSD1 (refs 3, 4) interacts with p53 to repress p53-mediated transcriptional activation and to inhibit the role of p53 in promoting apoptosis. We find that, in vitro, LSD1 removes both monomethylation (K370me1) and dimethylation (K370me2) at K370, a previously identified Smyd2-dependent monomethylation site(2). However, in vivo, LSD1 shows a strong preference to reverse K370me2, which is performed by a distinct, but unknown, methyltransferase. Our results indicate that K370me2 has a different role in regulating p53 from that of K370me1: K370me1 represses p53 function, whereas K370me2 promotes association with the coactivator 53BP1 (p53-binding protein 1) through tandem Tudor domains in 53BP1. Further, LSD1 represses p53 function through the inhibition of interaction of p53 with 53BP1. These observations show that p53 is dynamically regulated by lysine methylation and demethylation and that the methylation status at a single lysine residue confers distinct regulatory output. Lysine methylation therefore provides similar regulatory complexity for non-histone proteins and for histones.","Wistar Inst Anat & Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; Vienna Bioctr, Res Inst Mol Pathol, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; Univ Texas, MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Carcinogenesis, Smithville, TX 78957 USA","Berger, SL (reprint author), Wistar Inst Anat & Biol, 3601 Spruce St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",berger@wistar.org,"Huang, Jing/A-2566-2009","Huang, Jing/0000-0002-7163-5156; Espejo, Alexsandra/0000-0002-8841-7219",,,,28,373,392,1,42,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,6-Sep,2007,449,7158,,,,,105,U80,,10.1038/nature06092,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,207ED,WOS:000249233500045,17805299.0,No,,,11/20/17,shelley l.,berger,na,na,na,na,na

We report here that Trpc2(-/-) female mice show a reduction in female-specific behaviour, including maternal aggression and lactating behaviour. Strikingly, mutant females display unique characteristics of male sexual and courtship behaviours such as mounting, pelvic thrust, solicitation, anogenital olfactory investigation, and emission of complex ultrasonic vocalizations towards male and female conspecific mice. The same behavioural phenotype is observed after VNO surgical removal in adult animals, and is not accompanied by disruption of the oestrous cycle and sex hormone levels. These findings suggest that VNO-mediated pheromone inputs act in wild-type females to repress male behaviour and activate female behaviours.

Here, we demonstrate that self-renewal and pluripotent properties of human embryonic stem (ES) cells depend on a dynamic interplay between human ES cells and autologously derived human ES cell fibroblast-like cells (hdFs). Human ES cells and hdFs are uniquely defined by insulin-like growth factor (IGF)- and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-dependence. IGF 1 receptor (IGF1R) expression was exclusive to the human ES cells, whereas FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) expression was restricted to surrounding hdFs. Blocking the IGF-II/IGF1R pathway reduced survival and clonogenicity of human ES cells, whereas inhibition of the FGF pathway indirectly caused differentiation. IGF-II is expressed by hdFs in response to FGF, and alone was sufficient in maintaining human ES cell cultures. Our study demonstrates a direct role of the IGF-II/IGF1R axis on human ES cell physiology and establishes that hdFs produced by human ES cells themselves define the stem cell niche of pluripotent human stem cells.","McMaster Univ, Michael G DeGroote Sch Med, McMaster Stem Cell & Canc Res Inst, Hamilton, ON L8N 3Z5, Canada; Univ Western Ontario, Don Rix Prot Identificat Facil, Dept Biochem, Schulich Sch Med & Dent, London, ON N6A 5C1, Canada","Bhatia, M (reprint author), McMaster Univ, Michael G DeGroote Sch Med, McMaster Stem Cell & Canc Res Inst, Hamilton, ON L8N 3Z5, Canada.",mbhatia@mcmaster.ca,,"Werbowetski-Ogilvie, Tamra/0000-0002-5469-0559; Menendez, Pablo/0000-0001-9372-1007",,,,31,393,420,0,34,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,30-Aug,2007,448,7157,,,,,1015,U3,,10.1038/nature06027,,9,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,205EU,WOS:000249097600030,17625568.0,No,,,11/20/17,mickie,bhatia,female,0.88,25,na,na

How this process continues from metre-sized boulders to kilo-metre-scale planetesimals is a major unsolved problem(2): boulders are expected to stick together poorly(3), and to spiral into the protostar in a few hundred orbits owing to a 'headwind' from the slower rotating gas(4). Gravitational collapse of the solid component has been suggested to overcome this barrier(1,5,6). But even low levels of turbulence will inhibit sedimentation of solids to a sufficiently dense midplane layer(2,7), and turbulence must be present to explain observed gas accretion in protostellar disks(8). Here we report that boulders can undergo efficient gravitational collapse in locally overdense regions in the midplane of the disk. The boulders concentrate initially in transient high pressure regions in the turbulent gas(9), and these concentrations are augmented a further order of magnitude by a streaming instability(10-12) driven by the relative flow of gas and solids. We find that gravitationally bound clusters form with masses comparable to dwarf planets and containing a distribution of boulder sizes. Gravitational collapse happens much faster than radial drift, offering a possible path to planetesimal formation in accreting circumstellar disks.","Max Planck Inst Astron, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; Amer Museum Nat Hist, Dept Astrophys, New York, NY 10024 USA; Univ Virginia, Dept Astron, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; Univ Toronto, Canadian Inst Theoret Astrophys, Toronto, ON M5S 3H8, Canada","Johansen, A (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Astron, Konigstuhl 17, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany.",johansen@mpia.de,,"Youdin, Andrew/0000-0002-3644-8726; Mac Low, Mordecai-Mark/0000-0003-0064-4060; Klahr, Hubert/0000-0002-8227-5467",,,,30,496,499,4,29,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,30-Aug,2007,448,7157,,,,,1022,1025,,10.1038/nature06086,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,205EU,WOS:000249097600031,17728751.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,thomas,henning,male,1,3753,na,na

At millimetre wavelengths, kinematic signatures of collapse have been observed in several such protostars, through observations of molecular lines that probe their outer envelopes. It has been suggested that one or more components of the proto-multiple system NGC 1333-IRAS 4 (refs 1, 2) may display signs of an embedded region that is warmer and denser than the bulk of the envelope(3,4). Here we report observations that reveal details of the core on Solar System dimensions. We detect in NGC 1333-IRAS 4B a rich emission spectrum of H(2)O, at wavelengths 20-37 mu m, which indicates an origin in extremely dense, warm gas. We can model the emission as infall from a protostellar envelope onto the surface of a deeply embedded, dense disk, and therefore see the development of a protoplanetary disk. This is the only example of mid-infrared water emission from a sample of 30 class 0 objects, perhaps arising from a favourable orientation; alternatively, this may be an early and short-lived stage in the evolution of a protoplanetary disk.","Univ Rochester, Dept Phys & Astron, Rochester, NY 14627 USA; Univ Virginia, Dept Astron, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, NASA, Astrobiol Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Phys & Astron, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; Natl Opt Astron Observ, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA; Univ Michigan, Dept Astron, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Radioastron & Astrofis, Morelia 58089, Michoacan, Mexico; Cornell Univ, Ctr Radiophys & Space Res, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Watson, DM (reprint author), Univ Rochester, Dept Phys & Astron, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.",dmw@pas.rochester.edu,,"Watson, Dan/0000-0001-8302-0530",,,,23,56,56,0,1,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,30-Aug,2007,448,7157,,,,,1026,1028,,10.1038/nature06087,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,205EU,WOS:000249097600032,17728752.0,No,,,11/20/17,j. r.,houck,male,1,2,na,na

When interactions between the particles compete with their mobility through a tunnel junction, intriguing dynamical behaviour can arise because the particles do not tunnel independently. In single-electron or Bloch transistors, for example, the tunnelling of an electron or Cooper pair can be enabled or suppressed by the presence of a second charge carrier due to Coulomb blockade(1,2). Here we report direct, time-resolved observations of the correlated tunnelling of two interacting ultracold atoms through a barrier in a double-well potential. For the regime in which the interactions between the atoms are weak and tunnel coupling dominates, individual atoms can tunnel independently, similar to the case of a normal Josephson junction. However, when strong repulsive interactions are present, two atoms located on one side of the barrier cannot separate(3), but are observed to tunnel together as a pair in a second-order co-tunnelling process. By recording both the atom position and phase coherence over time, we fully characterize the tunnelling process for a single atom as well as the correlated dynamics of a pair of atoms for weak and strong interactions. In addition, we identify a conditional tunnelling regime in which a single atom can only tunnel in the presence of a second particle, acting as a single atom switch. Such second-order tunnelling events, which are the dominating dynamical effect in the strongly interacting regime, have not been previously observed with ultracold atoms. Similar second-order processes form the basis of superexchange interactions between atoms on neighbouring lattice sites of a periodic potential, a central component of proposals for realizing quantum magnetism(4-7).","Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Phys, D-55099 Mainz, Germany; Umea Univ, Dept Phys, S-90187 Umea, Sweden; Univ Bonn, Inst Angew Phys, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Quantum Elect, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland","Bloch, I (reprint author), Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Phys, D-55099 Mainz, Germany.",bloch@uni-mainz.de,"Bloch, Immanuel/G-3174-2010; Widera, Artur/D-1032-2017","Bloch, Immanuel/0000-0002-0679-4759; Widera, Artur/0000-0002-0338-9969; Folling, Simon/0000-0002-6951-3651",,,,30,332,333,3,38,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,30-Aug,2007,448,7157,,,,,1029,U4,,10.1038/nature06112,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,205EU,WOS:000249097600033,17728753.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,i.,bloch,na,na,na,na,na

To sustain vanishingly low oxygen levels despite near-modern rates of oxygen production from similar to 2.7-2.5 billion years ago thus requires that oxygen sinks must have been much larger than they are now. Here we propose that the rise of atmospheric oxygen occurred because the predominant sink for oxygen in the Archaean era-enhanced submarine volcanism-was abruptly and permanently diminished during the Archaean-Proterozoic transition. Observations(3-5) are consistent with the corollary that subaerial volcanism only became widespread after a major tectonic episode of continental stabilization at the beginning of the Proterozoic. Submarine volcanoes are more reducing than subaerial volcanoes(6), so a shift from predominantly submarine to a mix of subaerial and submarine volcanism more similar to that observed today would have reduced the overall sink for oxygen and led to the rise of atmospheric oxygen.","Penn State Univ, NASA, Astrobiol Inst, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; Penn State Univ, Dept Geosci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; Univ Western Australia, Sch Earth & Geog Sci, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia","Kump, LR (reprint author), Penn State Univ, NASA, Astrobiol Inst, 535 Deike Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",lkump@psu.edu,"Barley, Mark/A-3803-2008; Kump, Lee/H-8287-2012",,,,,30,146,149,3,69,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,30-Aug,2007,448,7157,,,,,1033,1036,,10.1038/nature06058,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,205EU,WOS:000249097600034,17728754.0,No,,,11/20/17,mark e.,barley,male,1,1,na,na

Plant stomata generally open less widely under increased carbon dioxide concentration(2), which reduces transpiration(1,3-6) and thus leaves more water at the land surface(7). This driver of change in the climate system, which we term 'physiological forcing', has been detected in observational records of increasing average continental runoff over the twentieth century(8). Here we use an ensemble of experiments with a global climate model that includes a vegetation component to assess the contribution of physiological forcing to future changes in continental runoff, in the context of uncertainties in future precipitation. We find that the physiological effect of doubled carbon dioxide concentrations on plant transpiration increases simulated global mean runoff by 6 per cent relative to pre-industrial levels; an increase that is comparable to that simulated in response to radiatively forced climate change (11 +/- 6 per cent). Assessments of the effect of increasing carbon dioxide concentrations on the hydrological cycle that only consider radiative forcing(9-11) will therefore tend to underestimate future increases in runoff and overestimate decreases. This suggests that freshwater resources may be less limited than previously assumed under scenarios of future global warming, although there is still an increased risk of drought. Moreover, our results highlight that the practice of assessing the climate-forcing potential of all greenhouse gases in terms of their radiative forcing potential relative to carbon dioxide does not accurately reflect the relative effects of different greenhouse gases on freshwater resources.","Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England; Univ Exeter, Sch Engn Comp & Math, Exeter EX4 4QF, Devon, England; Met Off, Joint Ctr Hydrometeorol Res, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England; Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England","Betts, RA (reprint author), Met Off Hadley Ctr, Fitzroy Rd, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England.",richard.betts@metoffice.gov.uk,"Huntingford, Chris/A-4307-2008; Collins, Matthew/F-8473-2011; Boucher, Olivier/J-5810-2012; Boucher, Olivier/K-7483-2012; Betts, Richard/P-8976-2015; Cox, Peter/B-3299-2012; Jones, Chris/I-2983-2014","Huntingford, Chris/0000-0002-5941-7770; Falloon, Peter/0000-0001-7567-8885; Collins, Matthew/0000-0003-3785-6008; Boucher, Olivier/0000-0003-2328-5769; Boucher, Olivier/0000-0003-2328-5769; ",,,,30,323,332,6,156,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,30-Aug,2007,448,7157,,,,,1037,U5,,10.1038/nature06045,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,205EU,WOS:000249097600035,17728755.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,mark j.,webb,na,na,na,na,na

However, despite being the most diverse plant family on Earth(2), the Orchidaceae lack a definitive fossil record and thus many aspects of their evolutionary history remain obscure. Here we report an exquisitely preserved orchid pollinarium (of Meliorchis caribea gen. et sp. nov.) attached to the mesoscutellum of an extinct stingless bee, Proplebeia dominicana, recovered from Miocene amber in the Dominican Republic, that is 15-20 million years (Myr) old(3). This discovery constitutes both the first unambiguous fossil of Orchidaceae(4) and an unprecedented direct fossil observation of a plant-pollinator interaction(5,6). By applying cladistic methods to a morphological character matrix, we resolve the phylogenetic position of M. caribea within the extant subtribe Goodyerinae (subfamily Orchidoideae). We use the ages of other fossil monocots and M. caribea to calibrate a molecular phylogenetic tree of the Orchidaceae. Our results indicate that the most recent common ancestor of extant orchids lived in the Late Cretaceous (76-84 Myr ago), and also suggest that the dramatic radiation of orchids began shortly after the mass extinctions at the K/T boundary. These results further support the hypothesis of an ancient origin for Orchidaceae.","Harvard Univ, Museum Comparat Zool, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Leiden Univ, Natl Herbarium Nederland, Leiden, Netherlands; Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Inst Biociencias, Dept Bot, BR-91501970 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Ramirez, SR (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Museum Comparat Zool, 26 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",sramirez@oeb.harvard.edu,"Ramirez, Santiago/B-4948-2012; Singer, Rodrigo/E-1945-2013","Gravendeel, Barbara/0000-0002-6508-0895",,,,30,127,138,9,89,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,30-Aug,2007,448,7157,,,,,1042,1045,,10.1038/nature06039,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,205EU,WOS:000249097600036,17728756.0,No,,,11/20/17,naomi e.,pierce,na,na,na,na,na

Species diversity in ecosystems is promoted by cyclic, non-hierarchical interactions among competing populations. Central features of such non-transitive relations are represented by the 'rock-paper-scissors' game, in which rock crushes scissors, scissors cut paper, and paper wraps rock. In combination with spatial dispersal of static populations, this type of competition results in the stable coexistence of all species and the long-term maintenance of biodiversity(1-5). However, population mobility is a central feature of real ecosystems: animals migrate, bacteria run and tumble. Here, we observe a critical influence of mobility on species diversity. When mobility exceeds a certain value, biodiversity is jeopardized and lost. In contrast, below this critical threshold all subpopulations coexist and an entanglement of travelling spiral waves forms in the course of time. We establish that this phenomenon is robust; it does not depend on the details of cyclic competition or spatial environment. These findings have important implications for maintenance and temporal development of ecological systems and are relevant for the formation and propagation of patterns in microbial populations or excitable media.","Univ Munich, Arnold Sommerfeld Ctr Theoret Phys, D-80333 Munich, Germany; Univ Munich, Dept Phys, Ctr NanoSci, D-80333 Munich, Germany","Frey, E (reprint author), Univ Munich, Arnold Sommerfeld Ctr Theoret Phys, Theresienstr 37, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",frey@lmu.de,"Reichenbach, Tobias/G-7475-2011; Mobilia, Mauro/A-7045-2010","Reichenbach, Tobias/0000-0003-3367-3511; Mobilia, Mauro/0000-0002-1424-567X; Frey, Erwin/0000-0001-8792-3358",,,,31,292,292,8,83,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,30-Aug,2007,448,7157,,,,,1046,1049,,10.1038/nature06095,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,205EU,WOS:000249097600037,17728757.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,erwin,frey,male,0.98,185,yqC5qr0AAAAJ,11191

Previous studies have identified one taste cell population marked by the gustatory receptor gene Gr5a that detects sugars, and a second population marked by Gr66a that detects bitter compounds(1-4). Here we identify a novel taste modality in this insect: the taste of carbonated water. We use a combination of anatomical, calcium imaging and behavioural approaches to identify a population of taste neurons that detects CO2 and mediates taste acceptance behaviour. The taste of carbonation may allow Drosophila to detect and obtain nutrients from growing microorganisms. Whereas CO2 detection by the olfactory system mediates avoidance(5), CO2 detection by the gustatory system mediates acceptance behaviour, demonstrating that the context of CO2 determines appropriate behaviour.

Here we show that dominant-negative mutations in the human signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) gene result in the classical multisystem HIES. We found that eight out of fifteen unrelated non-familial HIES patients had heterozygous STAT3 mutations, but their parents and siblings did not have the mutant STAT3 alleles, suggesting that these were de novo mutations. Five different mutations were found, all of which were located in the STAT3 DNA-binding domain. The patients' peripheral blood cells showed defective responses to cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10, and the DNA-binding ability of STAT3 in these cells was greatly diminished.

First, Tip60 is a co-regulator of transcription factors that either promote or suppress tumorigenesis, such as Myc and p53(2-4). Second, Tip60 modulates DNA-damage response (DDR) signalling(1), and a DDR triggered by oncogenes can counteract tumour progression(5,6). Using E-mu-myc transgenic mice that are heterozygous for a Tip60 gene (Htatip) knockout allele (hereafter denoted as Tip60(+/-) mice), we show that Tip60 counteracts Myc-induced lymphomagenesis in a haplo-insufficient manner and in a time window that is restricted to a pre- or early-tumoral stage. Tip60 heterozygosity severely impaired the Myc-induced DDR7-9 but caused no general DDR defect in B cells. Myc- and p53-dependent transcription were not affected, and neither were Myc- induced proliferation, activation of the ARF-p53 tumour suppressor pathway or the resulting apoptotic response(10-13). We found that the human TIP60 gene (HTATIP) is a frequent target for mono-allelic loss in human lymphomas and head-and-neck and mammary carcinomas, with concomitant reduction in mRNA levels. Immunohistochemical analysis also demonstrated loss of nuclear TIP60 staining in mammary carcinomas. These events correlated with disease grade and frequently concurred with mutation of p53. Thus, in both mouse and human, Tip60 has a haplo-insufficient tumour suppressor activity that is independent from-but not contradictory with-its role within the ARF-p53 pathway(1-3,14-16). We suggest that this is because critical levels of Tip60 are required for mounting an oncogene-induced DDR in incipient tumour cells(5,6), the failure of which might synergize with p53 mutation towards tumour progression(17-20).","European Inst Oncol, Dept Expt Oncol, I-20139 Milan, Italy; FIRC Inst Mol Oncol, IFOM, I-20139 Milan, Italy; Inst Canc Res, Chester Beatty Labs, Breakthrough Breast Canc Res Ctr, London SW3 6JB, England; Univ Manitoba, Manitoba Inst Cell Biol, Winnipeg, MB R3E 0V9, Canada; Univ Manitoba, Genom Ctr Canc Res & Diag, Winnipeg, MB R3E 0V9, Canada; Univ Milan, Dept Vet Pathol Hyg & Publ Hlth, Sect Vet & Avian Pathol, I-20133 Milan, Italy; San Croce & Carle Hosp, Dept Med Oncol, I-12100 Cuneo, Italy; Med Coll Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53226 USA","Amati, B (reprint author), European Inst Oncol, Dept Expt Oncol, I-20139 Milan, Italy.",bruno.amati@ifom-ieo-campus.it,"Squatrito, Massimo/F-4149-2016; Mai, Sabine/E-5667-2017","Squatrito, Massimo/0000-0002-4593-3790; Mai, Sabine/0000-0002-5797-2201; Scanziani, Eugenio/0000-0003-3996-5048; Nuciforo, Paolo/0000-0003-1380-0990",,,,43,179,187,0,13,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,30-Aug,2007,448,7157,,,,,1063,U12,,10.1038/nature06055,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,205EU,WOS:000249097600041,17728759.0,No,,,11/20/17,bruno,amati,male,1,926,na,na

In addition, dysfunctional telomeres might induce an ATM-independent pathway, such as ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase signalling, as indicated by the phosphorylation of the ATR target CHK1 in senescent cells(2,5) and the response of ATM-deficient cells to telomere dysfunction(6,7). However, because telomere attrition is accompanied by secondary DNA damage, it has remained unclear whether there is an ATM-independent pathway for the detection of damaged telomeres. Here we show that damaged mammalian telomeres can activate both ATM and ATR and address the mechanism by which the shelterin complex represses these two important DNA damage signalling pathways. We analysed the telomere damage response on depletion of either or both of the shelterin proteins telomeric repeat binding factor 2 (TRF2) and protection of telomeres 1 (POT1) from cells lacking ATM and/or ATR kinase signalling. The data indicate that TRF2 and POT1 act independently to repress these two DNA damage response pathways. TRF2 represses ATM, whereas POT1 prevents activation of ATR. Unexpectedly, we found that either ATM or ATR signalling is required for efficient non-homologous end-joining of dysfunctional telomeres. The results reveal how mammalian telomeres use multiple mechanisms to avoid DNA damage surveillance and provide an explanation for the induction of replicative senescence and genome instability by shortened telomeres.","Rockefeller Univ, Cell Biol & Genet Lab, New York, NY 10021 USA","de Lange, T (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Cell Biol & Genet Lab, 1230 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA.",delange@mail.rockefeller.edu,"lazzerini denchi, eros/F-7913-2010; de Lange, Titia/B-8263-2011","lazzerini denchi, eros/0000-0001-5378-4644; de Lange, Titia/0000-0002-9267-367X",,,,29,418,437,0,26,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,30-Aug,2007,448,7157,,,,,1068,1071,,10.1038/nature06065,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,205EU,WOS:000249097600042,17687332.0,No,,,11/20/17,titia,de lange,female,1,8,na,na

Mg2+ has the largest hydrated radius among all cations, whereas its ionic radius is the smallest. It remains obscure how Mg2+ transporters selectively recognize and dehydrate the large, fully hydrated Mg2+ cation for transport(1). Recently the crystal structures of the CorA Mg2+ transporter(2-5) were reported(6-8). The MgtE family of Mg2+ transporters is ubiquitously distributed in all phylogenetic domains(9-11), and human homologues have been functionally characterized and suggested to be involved in magnesium homeostasis(12-14). However, the MgtE transporters have not been thoroughly characterized. Here we determine the crystal structures of the full-length Thermus thermophilus MgtE at 3.5 angstrom resolution, and of the cytosolic domain in the presence and absence of Mg2+ at 2.3 angstrom and 3.9 angstrom resolutions, respectively. The transporter adopts a homodimeric architecture, consisting of the carboxy-terminal five transmembrane domains and the amino-terminal cytosolic domains, which are composed of the superhelical N domain and tandemly repeated cystathionine-beta-synthase domains. A solvent-accessible pore nearly traverses the transmembrane domains, with one potential Mg2+ bound to the conserved Asp 432 within the pore. The transmembrane (TM)5 helices from both subunits close the pore through interactions with the 'connecting helices', which connect the cystathionine-beta-synthase and transmembrane domains. Four putative Mg2+ ions are bound at the interface between the connecting helices and the other domains, and this may lock the closed conformation of the pore. A structural comparison of the two states of the cytosolic domains showed the Mg2+-dependent movement of the connecting helices, which might reorganize the transmembrane helices to open the pore. These findings suggest a homeostasis mechanism, in which Mg2+ bound between cytosolic domains regulates Mg2+ flux by sensing the intracellular Mg2+ concentration. Whether this presumed regulation controls gating of an ion channel or opening of a secondary active transporter remains to be determined.","Tokyo Inst Technol, Grad Sch Biosci & Biotechnol, Dept Biol Informat, Midori Ku, Kanagawa 2268501, Japan; Tokyo Inst Technol, Ctr Biol Resources & Informat, Midori Ku, Kanagawa 2268501, Japan; SORST, JST, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan","Nureki, O (reprint author), Tokyo Inst Technol, Grad Sch Biosci & Biotechnol, Dept Biol Informat, Midori Ku, 4259 Nagatsuta Cho, Kanagawa 2268501, Japan.",nureki@bio.titech.ac.jp,"Hattori, Motoyuki/B-6069-2014","Tanaka, Yoshiki/0000-0001-6960-5276",,,,34,113,117,0,16,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,30-Aug,2007,448,7157,,,,,1072,U13,,10.1038/nature06093,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,205EU,WOS:000249097600043,17700703.0,No,,,11/20/17,osamu,nureki,male,1,3,na,na

From an initial state generally exhibiting quantum uncertainty in the measured observable, the system is projected into a state in which this observable becomes precisely known. Its value is random, with a probability determined by the initial system's state. The evolution induced by measurement (known as 'state collapse') can be progressive, accumulating the effects of elementary state changes. Here we report the observation of such a step-by-step collapse by non-destructively measuring the photon number of a field stored in a cavity. Atoms behaving as microscopic clocks cross the cavity successively. By measuring the light-induced alterations of the clock rate, information is progressively extracted, until the initially uncertain photon number converges to an integer. The suppression of the photon number spread is demonstrated by correlations between repeated measurements. The procedure illustrates all the postulates of quantum measurement (state collapse, statistical results and repeatability) and should facilitate studies of non-classical fields trapped in cavities.","Univ Paris 06, CNRS, Ecole Normale Super, Lab Kastler Brossel, F-75231 Paris 05, France; Coll France, F-75231 Paris 05, France","Brune, M (reprint author), Univ Paris 06, CNRS, Ecole Normale Super, Lab Kastler Brossel, 24 Rue Lhomond, F-75231 Paris 05, France.",brune@lkb.ens.fr; haroche@lkb.ens.fr,"Kuhr, Stefan/F-7296-2011; Deleglise, Samuel/B-1599-2015","Deleglise, Samuel/0000-0002-8680-5170; Sayrin, Clement/0000-0002-9747-5912",,,,46,236,240,6,50,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Aug,2007,448,7156,,,,,889,U1,,10.1038/nature06057,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,202OM,WOS:000248912900039,17713527.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,serge,haroche,male,1,213,na,na

Electrophysiological, structural and biochemical studies of Sapap3-mutant mice reveal defects in cortico-striatal synapses. Furthermore, lentiviral-mediated selective expression of Sapap3 in the striatum rescues the synaptic and behavioural defects of Sapap3-mutant mice.

Unexpectedly, gap junctions do not mediate neuronal migration by acting in the classical manner to provide an aqueous channel for cell-cell communication. Instead, gap junctions provide dynamic adhesive contacts that interact with the internal cytoskeleton to enable leading process stabilization along radial fibres as well as the subsequent translocation of the nucleus.

Until recently, it was thought that Northern Hemisphere glaciation began much later, between 11 and 5 million years ago(1-3,5). This view has been challenged, however, by records of ice rafting at high northern latitudes during the Eocene epoch(6,7) and by estimates of global ice volume that exceed the storage capacity of Antarctica(8) at the same time as a temporary deepening of the calcite compensation depth 41.6 million years ago(9). Here we test the hypothesis that large ice sheets were present in both hemispheres 41.6 million years ago using marine sediment records of oxygen and carbon isotope values and of calcium carbonate content from the equatorial Atlantic Ocean. These records allow, at most, an ice budget that can easily be accommodated on Antarctica, indicating that large ice sheets were not present in the Northern Hemisphere. The records also reveal a brief interval shortly before the temporary deepening of the calcite compensation depth during which the calcite compensation depth shoaled, ocean temperatures increased and carbon isotope values decreased in the equatorial Atlantic. The nature of these changes around 41.6 million years ago implies common links, in terms of carbon cycling, with events at the Eocene/Oligocene boundary(4) and with the 'hyperthermals' of the Early Eocene climate optimum(3,10,11). Our findings help to resolve the apparent discrepancy between the geological records of Northern Hemisphere glaciation(6-8) and model results(12,13) that indicate that the threshold for continental glaciation was crossed earlier in the Southern Hemisphere than in the Northern Hemisphere.","Natl Oceanog Ctr, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England; Univ Tokyo, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan","Wilson, PA (reprint author), Natl Oceanog Ctr, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci, European Way, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England.",paw1@noc.soton.ac.uk,"Sexton, Philip/B-2493-2010","suganuma, yusuke/0000-0003-3516-1317; Edgar, Kirsty/0000-0001-7587-9951",,,,30,51,52,0,18,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Aug,2007,448,7156,,,,,908,911,,10.1038/nature06053,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,202OM,WOS:000248912900042,17713530.0,No,,,11/20/17,yusuke,suganuma,male,1,28,Jaf7rrYAAAAJ,563

The timing of climate change in the Southern Hemisphere at glacial-interglacial transitions (which are known as terminations) relative to variations in summer insolation in the Northern Hemisphere is an important test of this hypothesis. So far, it has only been possible to apply this test to the most recent termination(2,3), because the dating uncertainty associated with older terminations is too large to allow phase relationships to be determined. Here we present a new chronology of Antarctic climate change over the past 360,000 years that is based on the ratio of oxygen to nitrogen molecules in air trapped in the Dome Fuji and Vostok ice cores(4,5). This ratio is a proxy for local summer insolation(5), and thus allows the chronology to be constructed by orbital tuning without the need to assume a lag between a climate record and an orbital parameter. The accuracy of the chronology allows us to examine the phase relationships between climate records from the ice cores(6-9) and changes in insolation. Our results indicate that orbital-scale Antarctic climate change lags Northern Hemisphere insolation by a few millennia, and that the increases in Antarctic temperature and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration during the last four terminations occurred within the rising phase of Northern Hemisphere summer insolation. These results support the Milankovitch theory that Northern Hemisphere summer insolation triggered the last four deglaciations(3,10,11).","Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Ctr Atmospher & Ocean Studies, Sendai, Miyagi 9808578, Japan; Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; UJF, CNRS, Lab Glaciol & Geophys Environm, F-38400 Grenoble, France; Boston Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Boston, MA 02215 USA; Natl Inst Polar Res, Res Org Informat & Syst, Itabashi Ku, Tokyo 1738515, Japan; IRD, UR Great Ice, Gif Sur Yvette, France; CEA, UMR CNRS UVSQ, CE Saclay, IPSL LSCE, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England","Kawamura, K (reprint author), Natl Inst Polar Res, Res Org Informat & Syst, Itabashi Ku, 1-9-10 Kaga, Tokyo 1738515, Japan.",kawamura@nipr.ac.jp,"Lisiecki, Lorraine/C-4066-2008; Kawamura, Kenji/C-7660-2011; Parrenin, Frederic/H-3054-2014; Fujita, Shuji/A-7884-2016","Kawamura, Kenji/0000-0003-1163-700X; Parrenin, Frederic/0000-0002-9489-3991; Fujita, Shuji/0000-0003-0127-0777; Uemura, Ryu/0000-0002-4236-0085",,,,33,210,226,9,89,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Aug,2007,448,7156,,,,,912,U4,,10.1038/nature06015,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,202OM,WOS:000248912900043,17713531.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,okitsugu,watanabe,na,na,na,na,na

Inclusions of quartz, K-feldspar and monazite in the zircons(3), in combination with an enrichment of light rare-earth elements(4,5) and an estimated low zircon crystallization temperature(6), have previously been used as evidence for early recycling of continental crust, leading to the production of granitic melts in the Hadean era. Here we present the discovery of microdiamond inclusions in Jack Hills zircons with an age range from 3,0586 +/- 7 to 4,2526 +/- 7 million years. These include the oldest known diamonds found in terrestrial rocks, and introduce a new dimension to the debate on the origin of these zircons and the evolution of the early Earth(6-10). The spread of ages indicates that either conditions required for diamond formation were repeated several times during early Earth history or that there was significant recycling of ancient diamond. Mineralogical features of the Jack Hills diamonds-such as their occurrence in zircon, their association with graphite and their Raman spectroscopic characteristics-resemble those of diamonds formed during ultrahigh-pressure metamorphism and, unless conditions on the early Earth were unique, imply a relatively thick continental lithosphere and crust-mantle interaction at least 4,250 million years ago.","Univ Munster, Inst Mineral, D-48149 Munster, Germany; Curtin Univ Technol, Western Australian Sch Mines, Dept Appl Geol, Bentley, WA 6102, Australia","Menneken, M (reprint author), Univ Munster, Inst Mineral, Corrensstr 24, D-48149 Munster, Germany.",m_menn03@uni-muenster.de; tgeisler@nwz.uni-muenster.de,"Wilde, Simon /C-5174-2009","Wilde, Simon /0000-0002-4546-8278; Nemchin, Alexander/0000-0002-3955-3409",,,,35,72,80,1,34,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Aug,2007,448,7156,,,,,917,U5,,10.1038/nature06083,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,202OM,WOS:000248912900044,17713532.0,No,,,11/20/17,simon a.,wilde,na,na,na,na,na

However, because of the dearth of fossil hominoid remains in sub-Saharan Africa spanning the period 12-7 Myr ago, nothing is known of the actual timing and mode of divergence of the African ape and hominid lineages. Most genomic-based studies suggest a late divergence date-5-6 Myr ago and 6-8 Myr ago for the human-chimp and human-gorilla splits, respectively(10-14)-and some palaeontological and molecular analyses hypothesize a Eurasian origin of the African ape and hominid clade(15,16). We report here the discovery and recognition of a new species of great ape, Chororapithecus abyssinicus, from the 10-10.5-Myr-old deposits of the Chorora Formation at the southern margin of the Afar rift. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first fossils of a large-bodied Miocene ape from the African continent north of Kenya. They exhibit a gorilla-sized dentition that combines distinct shearing crests with thick enamel on its 'functional' side cusps. Visualization of the enamel-dentine junction by micro-computed tomography reveals shearing crest features that partly resemble the modern gorilla condition. These features represent genetically based structural modifications probably associated with an initial adaptation to a comparatively fibrous diet. The relatively flat cuspal enamel-dentine junction and thick enamel, however, suggest a concurrent adaptation to hard and/or abrasive food items. The combined evidence suggests that Chororapithecus may be a basal member of the gorilla clade, and that the latter exhibited some amount of adaptive and phyletic diversity at around 10-11 Myr ago.","Univ Tokyo, Univ Museum, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; Natl Museum Nat & Sci, Dept Anthropol, Shinjuku Ku, Tokyo 1690073, Japan; Hyogo Museum Nat & Human Activities, Div Nat Hist, Sanda, Hyogo 6691546, Japan; Rift Valley Res Serv, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; Minist Culture & Tourism, Dept Archaeol & Paleontol, Author Res & Conservat Cultural Heritage, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia","Suwa, G (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Univ Museum, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",suwa@um.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,,,,,30,88,91,0,23,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Aug,2007,448,7156,,,,,921,924,,10.1038/nature06113,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,202OM,WOS:000248912900045,17713533.0,No,,,11/20/17,yonas,beyene,male,1,23,na,na

Here we use phylogenetic methods(10,11) to show that the phylogenetic relationships of species predict the number of interactions they exhibit in more than one-third of the networks, and the identity of the species with which they interact in about half of the networks. As a consequence of the phylogenetic effects on interaction patterns, simulated extinction events tend to trigger coextinction cascades of related species. This results in a non-random pruning of the evolutionary tree(12,13) and a more pronounced loss of taxonomic diversity than expected in the absence of a phylogenetic signal.

In human and mouse, IgA-producing plasma cells comprise similar to 20% of total plasma cells of peripheral lymphoid tissues, whereas more than 80% of plasma cells produce IgA in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues (MALT)(1-6). One of the most biologically important and long-standing questions in immunology is why this 'biased' IgA synthesis takes place in the MALT but not other lymphoid organs. Here we show that IgA class-switch recombination (CSR) is impaired in inducible-nitric-oxide-synthase-deficient (iNOS(-/-); gene also called Nos2) mice. iNOS regulates the T-cell-dependent IgA CSR through expression of transforming growth factor-beta receptor, and the T-cell-independent IgA CSR through production of a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL, also called Tnfsf13) and a B-cell-activating factor of the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) family (BAFF, also called Tnfsf13b). Notably, iNOS is preferentially expressed in MALT dendritic cells in response to the recognition of commensal bacteria by toll-like receptor. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of iNOS(+) dendritic cells rescues IgA production in iNOS(-/-) mice. Further analysis revealed that the MALT dendritic cells are a TNF-alpha/iNOS-producing dendritic-cell subset, originally identified in mice infected with Listeria monocytogenes(7,8). The presence of a naturally occurring TNF-alpha/iNOS-producing dendritic-cell subset may explain the predominance of IgA production in the MALT, critical for gut homeostasis.","Akita Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Immunol, Akita 0108543, Japan; Tokushima Bunri Univ, Fac Pharmaceut Sci, Kagawa 7692193, Japan; Keio Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Tokyo 1608582, Japan; Mitsubishi Kagaku Inst Life Sci, Tokyo 1948511, Japan; Kyorin Univ, Sch Med, Dept Dermatol, Tokyo 1818611, Japan; Osaka Univ, Microbial Dis Res Inst, Dept Host Def, Osaka 5650871, Japan","Ohteki, T (reprint author), Akita Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Immunol, Akita 0108543, Japan.",tohteki@med.akita-u.ac.jp,"Akira, Shizuo/C-3134-2009",,,,,34,239,247,0,17,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Aug,2007,448,7156,,,,,929,U7,,10.1038/nature06033,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,202OM,WOS:000248912900047,17713535.0,No,,,11/20/17,toshiaki,ohteki,male,1,2,na,na

Promiscuous expression of a set of self-antigens occurs in medullary thymic epithelial cells(4,5) and is partly controlled by the autoimmune regulator (AIRE), a nuclear protein for which loss-of-function mutations cause the type 1 autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome(6,7). However, additional factors must be involved in the regulation of this promiscuous expression. Here we describe a mechanism controlling thymic transcription of a prototypic tissue-restricted human auto-antigen gene, CHRNA1. This gene encodes the alpha-subunit of the muscle acetylcholine receptor, which is the main target of pathogenic auto-antibodies in autoimmune myasthenia gravis(8,9). On re-sequencing theCHRNA1 gene, we identified a functional bi-allelic variant in the promoter that is associated with early onset of disease in two independent human populations (France and United Kingdom). We show that this variant prevents binding of interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) and abrogates CHRNA1 promoter activity in thymic epithelial cells in vitro. Notably, both the CHRNA1 promoter variant and AIRE modulate CHRNA1 messenger RNA levels in human medullary thymic epithelial cells ex vivo and also in a transactivation assay. These findings reveal a critical function of AIRE and the interferon signalling pathway in regulating quantitative expression of this auto-antigen in the thymus, suggesting that together they set the threshold for self-tolerance versus autoimmunity.","INSERM, U580, F-75015 Paris, France; Univ Paris 05, F-75015 Paris, France; Univ Oxford, Weatherhall Inst Mol Med, Neurosci Grp, Oxford OX3 9DS, England; German Canc Res Ctr, Tumor Immunol Program, Div Dev Immunol, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; Univ Manchester, CIGMR, Manchester M13 9PT, Lancs, England; Univ Manchester, ARC, Epidemiol Unit, Manchester M13 9PT, Lancs, England; Int Ctr Genet Engn & Biotechnol, I-34012 Trieste, Italy; Hop La Pitie Salpetriere, Inst Myol, F-75013 Paris, France; CHRU, Hop Civil, Serv Neurol, F-67091 Strasbourg, France; Hop Raymond Poincare, Serv Reanimat, F-92380 Garches, France","Garchon, HJ (reprint author), INSERM, U580, F-75015 Paris, France.",garchon@necker.fr,"Ke, Xiayi/C-7674-2009; Giraud, Matthieu/E-4972-2017","Giraud, Matthieu/0000-0002-1208-9677; Pagani, Franco/0000-0002-2678-3459; vandiedonck, claire/0000-0002-6669-6923",Medical Research Council [G117/490],,,28,115,124,1,9,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Aug,2007,448,7156,,,,,934,U9,,10.1038/nature06066,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,202OM,WOS:000248912900048,17687331.0,No,,,11/20/17,henri-jean,garchon,na,na,na,na,na

Despite its fundamental importance, little is known about how plants sense and adapt to darkness in the daily light-dark cycle, or how they adapt to unpredictable environmental stresses that compromise photosynthesis and respiration and deplete energy supplies. Current models emphasize diverse stress perception and signalling mechanisms(1,2). Using a combination of cellular and systems screens, we show here that the evolutionarily conserved Arabidopsis thaliana protein kinases, KIN10 and KIN11 (also known as AKIN10/At3g01090 and AKIN11/At3g29160, respectively), control convergent reprogramming of transcription in response to seemingly unrelated darkness, sugar and stress conditions. Sensing and signalling deprivation of sugar and energy, KIN10 targets a remarkably broad array of genes that orchestrate transcription networks, promote catabolism and suppress anabolism. Specific bZIP transcription factors partially mediate primary KIN10 signalling. Transgenic KIN10 overexpression confers enhanced starvation tolerance and lifespan extension, and alters architecture and developmental transitions. Significantly, double kin10 kin11 deficiency abrogates the transcriptional switch in darkness and stress signalling, and impairs starch mobilization at night and growth. These studies uncover surprisingly pivotal roles of KIN10/11 in linking stress, sugar and developmental signals to globally regulate plant metabolism, energy balance, growth and survival. In contrast to the prevailing view that sucrose activates plant SnRK1s (Snf1-related protein kinases)(3-6), our functional analyses of Arabidopsis KIN10/11 provide compelling evidence that SnRK1s are inactivated by sugars and share central roles with the orthologous yeast Snf1 and mammalian AMPK in energy signalling.","Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02114 USA; Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Mol Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; VIB, Dept Mol Microbiol, B-3001 Louvain, Belgium; Katholieke Univ Leuven, Inst Bot & Microbiol, Mol Cell Biol Lab, B-3001 Louvain, Belgium","Rolland, F (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",baena@molbio.mgh.harvard.edu; filip.rolland@bio.kuleuven.be,"Thevelein, Johan/A-7897-2013; Baena-Gonzalez, Elena/G-5811-2013","Thevelein, Johan/0000-0002-2626-0180; Baena-Gonzalez, Elena/0000-0001-6598-3579",,,,45,552,571,11,180,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Aug,2007,448,7156,,,,,938,U10,,10.1038/nature06069,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,202OM,WOS:000248912900049,17671505.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,jen,sheen,female,0.99,1233,na,na

The locus encodes three cell cycle inhibitory proteins: p15(INK4b) encoded by CDKN2b, p16(INK4a) encoded by CDKN2a and p14(ARF) (p19(Arf) in mice) encoded by an alternative reading frame of CDKN2a (ref. 1). Whereas the tumour suppressor functions for p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF) have been firmly established, the role of p15(INK4b) remains ambiguous. However, many 9p21 deletions also remove CDKN2b, so we hypothesized a synergistic effect of the combined deficiency for p15(INK4b), p14(ARF) and p16(INK4a). Here we report that mice deficient for all three open reading frames (Cdkn2ab(-/-)) are more tumour-prone and develop a wider spectrum of tumours than Cdkn2a mutant mice, with a preponderance of skin tumours and soft tissue sarcomas (for example, mesothelioma) frequently composed of mixed cell types and often showing biphasic differentiation. Cdkn2ab(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) are substantially more sensitive to oncogenic transformation than Cdkn2a mutant MEFs. Under conditions of stress, p15(Ink4b) protein levels are significantly elevated in MEFs deficient for p16(Ink4a).

However, its effect on the precision of a natural eukaryotic circuit such as the control of cell cycle remains unclear. We use single-cell imaging of fluorescently labelled budding yeast to measure times from division to budding (G1) and from budding to the next division. The variability in G1 decreases with the square root of the ploidy through a 1N/2N/4N ploidy series, consistent with simple stochastic models for molecular noise. Also, increasing the gene dosage of G1 cyclins decreases the variability in G1. A new single-cell reporter for cell protein content allows us to determine the contribution to temporal G1 variability of deterministic size control (that is, smaller cells extending G1). Cell size control contributes significantly to G1 variability in daughter cells but not in mother cells. However, even in daughters, size-independent noise is the largest quantitative contributor to G1 variability. Exit of the transcriptional repressor Whi5 from the nucleus partitions G1 into two temporally uncorrelated and functionally distinct steps. The first step, which depends on the G1 cyclin gene CLN3, corresponds to noisy size control that extends G1 in small daughters, but is of negligible duration in mothers. The second step, whose variability decreases with increasing CLN2 gene dosage, is similar in mothers and daughters. This analysis decomposes the regulatory dynamics of the Start transition into two independent modules, a size sensing module and a timing module, each of which is predominantly controlled by a different G1 cyclin.","Rockefeller Univ, Ctr Studies Phys & Biol, New York, NY 10021 USA","Cross, FR (reprint author), Rockefeller Univ, Ctr Studies Phys & Biol, 1230 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA.",fcross@mail.rockefeller.edu,,"Di Talia, Stefano/0000-0001-9758-7925",,,,30,196,198,1,30,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Aug,2007,448,7156,,,,,947,U12,,10.1038/nature06072,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,202OM,WOS:000248912900051,17713537.0,No,,,11/20/17,frederick r.,cross,na,na,na,na,na

Sodium-coupled transporters are blocked by a number of therapeutically important compounds, including diuretics(9), anticonvulsants(10) and antidepressants(11), many of which have also become indispensable tools in biochemical experiments designed to probe antagonist binding sites and to elucidate transport mechanisms. Steady-state kinetic data have revealed that both competitive(12,13) and noncompetitive(14,15) modes of inhibition exist. Antagonist dissociation experiments on the serotonin transporter (SERT) have also unveiled the existence of a low-affinity allosteric site that slows the dissociation of inhibitors from a separate high-affinity site(16). Despite these strides, atomic-level insights into inhibitor action have remained elusive. Here we screen a panel of molecules for their ability to inhibit LeuT, a prokaryotic homologue of mammalian neurotransmitter sodium symporters, and show that the tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) clomipramine noncompetitively inhibits substrate uptake. Cocrystal structures show that clomipramine, along with two other TCAs, binds in an extracellular-facing vestibule about 11 angstrom above the substrate and two sodium ions, apparently stabilizing the extracellular gate in a closed conformation. Off-rate assays establish that clomipramine reduces the rate at which leucine dissociates from LeuT and reinforce our contention that this TCA inhibits LeuT by slowing substrate release. Our results represent a molecular view into noncompetitive inhibition of a sodium-coupled transporter and define principles for the rational design of new inhibitors.","Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Vollum Inst, Portland, OR 97239 USA; Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Portland, OR 97239 USA; Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, New York, NY 10032 USA","Gouaux, E (reprint author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Vollum Inst, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Rd, Portland, OR 97239 USA.",gouauxe@ohsu.edu,"Yamashita, Atsuko/H-5566-2017","Yamashita, Atsuko/0000-0002-8001-4642",,,,30,265,271,5,44,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,23-Aug,2007,448,7156,,,,,952,956,,10.1038/nature06038,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,202OM,WOS:000248912900052,17687333.0,No,,,11/20/17,eric,gouaux,male,1,4110,na,na

When proteins are unrelated to others of known activity, bioinformatics inference for function becomes problematic. It would thus be useful to interrogate protein structures for function directly. Here, we predict the function of an enzyme of unknown activity, Tm0936 from Thermotoga maritima, by docking high- energy intermediate forms of thousands of candidate metabolites. The docking hit list was dominated by adenine analogues, which appeared to undergo C6- deamination. Four of these, including 5- methylthioadenosine and S- adenosylhomocysteine ( SAH), were tested as substrates, and three had substantial catalytic rate constants ( 10(5) M-1 s(-1)). The X- ray crystal structure of the complex between Tm0936 and the product resulting from the deamination of SAH, S- inosylhomocysteine, was determined, and it corresponded closely to the predicted structure. The deaminated products can be further metabolized by T. maritima in a previously uncharacterized SAH degradation pathway.

These stars are relatively common and they return a large fraction of their original mass to the interstellar medium ( ISM) ( ref. 2) through a processed, dusty, molecular wind. Thus stars in Mira's stage of evolution have a direct impact on subsequent star and planet formation in their host galaxy. Previously, the only direct observation(3) of the interaction between Mira- type stellar winds and the ISM was in the infrared. Here we report the discovery of an ultraviolet- emitting bow shock and turbulent wake extending over 2 degrees on the sky, arising from Mira's large space velocity and the interaction between its wind and the ISM. The wake is visible only in the far ultraviolet and is consistent with an unusual emission mechanism whereby molecular hydrogen is excited by turbulent mixing of cool molecular gas and shock- heated gas. This wind wake is a tracer of the past 30,000 years of Mira's mass- loss history and provides an excellent laboratory for studying turbulent stellar wind - ISM interactions.","CALTECH, Dept Phys Math & Astron, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; Carnegie Inst Washington Observ, Pasadena, CA 91101 USA; Columbia Univ, Dept Astron, New York, NY 10027 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Phys & Astron, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Space Sci Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Martin, DC (reprint author), CALTECH, Dept Phys Math & Astron, 1200 E Calif Blvd,Mail Code 405-47, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",cmartin@srl.caltech.edu,,,,,,25,88,89,0,1,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,16-Aug,2007,448,7155,,,,,780,783,,10.1038/nature06003,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,200HJ,WOS:000248754200033,17700694.0,No,,,11/20/17,tom a.,barlow,na,na,na,na,na

Because quantum physics allow atoms to remain in superpositions of states, the classical cat would then be simultaneously dead and alive. By analogy, a 'cat' state of freely propagating light can be defined as a quantum superposition of well separated quasiclassical states(2,3) - it is a classical light wave that simultaneously possesses two opposite phases. Such states play an important role in fundamental tests of quantum theory(4-7) and in many quantum information processing tasks, including quantum computation(8), quantum teleportation(9,10) and precision measurements(11). Recently, optical Schrodinger 'kittens' were prepared(12-14); however, they are too small for most of the aforementioned applications and increasing their size is experimentally challenging. Here we demonstrate, theoretically and experimentally, a protocol that allows the generation of arbitrarily large squeezed Schrodinger cat states, using homodyne detection and photon number states as resources. We implemented this protocol with light pulses containing two photons, producing a squeezed Schrodinger cat state with a negative Wigner function. This state clearly exhibits several quantum phase- space interference fringes between the 'dead' and 'alive' components, and is large enough to become useful for quantum information processing and experimental tests of quantum theory.","Univ Paris 11, CNRS, Lab Charles Fabry, Inst Opt,UMR 8501, F-91127 Palaiseau, France; Univ Queensland, Ctr Quantum Comp Technol, Dept Phys, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia","Ourjoumtsev, A (reprint author), Univ Paris 11, CNRS, Lab Charles Fabry, Inst Opt,UMR 8501, F-91127 Palaiseau, France.",alexei.ourjoumtsev@institutoptique.fr,,,,,,27,314,319,1,36,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,16-Aug,2007,448,7155,,,,,784,786,,10.1038/nature06054,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,200HJ,WOS:000248754200034,17700695.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,philippe,grangier,male,0.99,605,Hhf5zIQAAAAJ,23436

Most glassformers are organic molecular systems, but there are important inorganic examples too(1,2), such as silicon dioxide and elemental selenium ( the latter being polymeric). Bulk metallic glasses can now be made(3); but, with the exception of Zr50Cu50 ( ref. 4), they require multiple components to avoid crystallization during normal liquid cooling. Two-component 'metglasses' can often be achieved by hyperquenching, but this has not hitherto been achieved with a single- component system. Glasses form when crystal nucleation rates are slow, although the factors that create the slow nucleation conditions are not well understood. Here we apply the insights gained in a recent molecular dynamics simulation study(5) to create conditions for successful vitrification of metallic liquid germanium.

Coupled climate - carbon cycle models suggest that global warming will act to limit the land- carbon sink(2), but these first generation models neglected the impacts of changing atmospheric chemistry. Emissions associated with fossil fuel and biomass burning have acted to approximately double the global mean tropospheric ozone concentration(3), and further increases are expected over the twenty- first century(4). Tropospheric ozone is known to damage plants, reducing plant primary productivity and crop yields(5), yet increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are thought to stimulate plant primary productivity(6). Increased carbon dioxide and ozone levels can both lead to stomatal closure, which reduces the uptake of either gas, and in turn limits the damaging effect of ozone and the carbon dioxide fertilization of photosynthesis(6). Here we estimate the impact of projected changes in ozone levels on the land- carbon sink, using a global land carbon cycle model modified to include the effect of ozone deposition on photosynthesis and to account for interactions between ozone and carbon dioxide through stomatal closure(7). For a range of sensitivity parameters based on manipulative field experiments, we find a significant suppression of the global land- carbon sink as increases in ozone concentrations affect plant productivity. In consequence, more carbon dioxide accumulates in the atmosphere. We suggest that the resulting indirect radiative forcing by ozone effects on plants could contribute more to global warming than the direct radiative forcing due to tropospheric ozone increases.","Hadley Ctr Climate Predict & Res JCHMR, Met Off, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England; Ctr Ecol & Hydrol Wallingford, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England; Univ Exeter, Sch Engn Comp Sci & Math, Exeter ES4 4QF, Devon, England; Hadley Ctr Climate Predict & Res, Met Off, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England","Sitch, S (reprint author), Hadley Ctr Climate Predict & Res JCHMR, Met Off, Maclean Bldg, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England.",stephen.sitch@metoffice.gov.uk,"Huntingford, Chris/A-4307-2008; Collins, William/A-5895-2010; Sitch, Stephen/F-8034-2015; Cox, Peter/B-3299-2012","Huntingford, Chris/0000-0002-5941-7770; Collins, William/0000-0002-7419-0850; Sitch, Stephen/0000-0003-1821-8561; ",,,,30,433,462,15,191,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,16-Aug,2007,448,7155,,,,,791,U4,,10.1038/nature06059,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,200HJ,WOS:000248754200036,17653194.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,c.,huntingford,male,1,1,na,na

Serpentinized ultramafic rocks have been associated with creeping faults in central and northern California(6-8), and serpentinite is commonly invoked as the cause of the creep and the low strength of this section of the San Andreas fault. However, the frictional strengths of serpentine minerals are too high to satisfy the limitations on fault strength, and these minerals also have the potential for unstable slip under some conditions(9,10). Here we report the discovery of talc in cuttings of serpentinite collected from the probable active trace of the San Andreas fault that was intersected during drilling of the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth ( SAFOD) main hole in 2005. We infer that the talc is forming as a result of the reaction of serpentine minerals with silica- saturated hydrothermal fluids that migrate up the fault zone, and the talc commonly occurs in sheared serpentinite. This discovery is significant, as the frictional strength of talc at elevated temperatures is sufficiently low to meet the constraints on the shear strength of the fault, and its inherently stable sliding behaviour is consistent with fault creep(11). Talc may therefore provide the connection between serpentinite and creep in the San Andreas fault, if shear at depth can become localized along a talc- rich principal- slip surface within serpentinite entrained in the fault zone.","US Geol Survey, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA","Moore, DE (reprint author), US Geol Survey, 345 Middlefield Rd,Mail Stop 977, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA.",dmoore@usgs.gov,,,,,,28,197,202,7,50,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,16-Aug,2007,448,7155,,,,,795,797,,10.1038/nature06064,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,200HJ,WOS:000248754200037,17700697.0,No,,,11/20/17,michael j.,rymer,na,na,na,na,na

In group- living mammals, dispersal is normally male- biased and in theory this sexual bias could be a response by males to female mate preferences, competition for access to females or resources, or the result of males avoiding inbreeding(2-7). There is a lack of studies on social mammals that simultaneously assess these factors and measure the fitness consequences of male dispersal decisions. Here we show that male- biased dispersal in the spotted hyaena ( Crocuta crocuta) most probably results from an adaptive response by males to simple female mate- choice rules that have evolved to avoid inbreeding. Microsatellite profiling revealed that females preferred sires that were born into or immigrated into the female's group after the female was born. Furthermore, young females preferred short- tenured sires and older females preferred longer- tenured sires. Males responded to these female mate preferences by initiating their reproductive careers in groups containing the highest number of young females. As a consequence, 11% of males started their reproductive career in their natal group and 89% of males dispersed. Males that started reproduction in groups containing the highest number of young females had a higher long- term reproductive success than males that did not. The female mate- choice rules ensured that females effectively avoided inbreeding without the need to discriminate directly against close kin or males born in their own group, or to favour immigrant males. The extent of male dispersal as a response to such female mate preferences depends on the demographic structure of breeding groups, rather than the genetic relatedness between females and males.","Leibniz Inst Zoo & Wildlife Res, D-10315 Berlin, Germany; Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England","Honer, OP (reprint author), Leibniz Inst Zoo & Wildlife Res, Alfred Kowalke Str 17, D-10315 Berlin, Germany.",hoener@izw-berlin.de,"Honer, Oliver/N-3224-2014; Burke, Terry/B-3196-2011","Honer, Oliver/0000-0002-0658-3417; Burke, Terry/0000-0003-3848-1244; Hofer, Heribert/0000-0002-2813-7442",,,,30,50,50,1,46,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,16-Aug,2007,448,7155,,,,,798,U5,,10.1038/nature06040,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,200HJ,WOS:000248754200038,17700698.0,No,,,11/20/17,h.,hofer,male,1,1,qF1nVOIAAAAJ,5786

Correlated firing has been linked to stimulus encoding(9), attention(11), stimulus discrimination(4), and motor behaviour(12). Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying correlated spiking are poorly understood(2,3,13-20), and its coding implications are still debated(13,16,21,22). It is not clear, for instance, whether correlations between the discharges of two neurons are determined solely by the correlation between their afferent currents, or whether they also depend on the mean and variance of the input. We addressed this question by computing the spike train correlation coefficient of unconnected pairs of in vitro cortical neurons receiving correlated inputs. Notably, even when the input correlation remained fixed, the spike train output correlation increased with the firing rate, but was largely independent of spike train variability. With a combination of analytical techniques and numerical simulations using 'integrate- and- fire' neuron models we show that this relationship between output correlation and firing rate is robust to input heterogeneities. Finally, this overlooked relationship is replicated by a standard threshold- linear model, demonstrating the universality of the result.

Although uncommon in most sporadic cancers(2), inactivating somatic mutations of LKB1 have been reported in primary human lung adenocarcinomas and derivative cell lines(3-5). Here we used a somatically activatable mutant Kras- driven model of mouse lung cancer to compare the role of Lkb1 to other tumour suppressors in lung cancer. Although Kras mutation cooperated with loss of p53 or Ink4a/ Arf ( also known as Cdkn2a) in this system, the strongest cooperation was seen with homozygous inactivation of Lkb1. Lkb1- deficient tumours demonstrated shorter latency, an expanded histological spectrum ( adeno-, squamous and large- cell carcinoma) and more frequent metastasis compared to tumours lacking p53 or Ink4a/ Arf. Pulmonary tumorigenesis was also accelerated by hemizygous inactivation of Lkb1. Consistent with these findings, inactivation of LKB1 was found in 34% and 19% of 144 analysed human lung adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas, respectively. Expression profiling in human lung cancer cell lines and mouse lung tumours identified a variety of metastasis-promoting genes, such as NEDD9, VEGFC and CD24, as targets of LKB1 repression in lung cancer. These studies establish LKB1 as a critical barrier to pulmonary tumorigenesis, controlling initiation, differentiation and metastasis.","Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med Oncol, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Environm Hlth, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biostat, Sch Publ Hlth, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Ludwig Ctr Dana Farber, Harvard Canc Ctr, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Div Translat Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Surg, Childrens Hosp, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Univ N Carolina, Sch Med, Lineberger Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dept Genet, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; Univ N Carolina, Sch Med, Lineberger Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dept Med, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; Univ N Carolina, Sch Med, Lineberger Comprehens Canc Ctr, Curriculum Genet & Mol Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; Univ Tennessee, Ctr Hlth Sci, Dept Mol Sci, Memphis, TN 38163 USA; Univ Texas, SW Med Ctr, Dept Pathol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; Univ Texas, SW Med Ctr, Simmons Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; Harvard Univ, Broad Inst, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Canc, Boston, MA 02114 USA","Wong, KK (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med Oncol, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",nelbardeesy@partners.org; nes@med.unc.edu; kwong1@partners.org,"; Meyerson, Matthew/E-7123-2012; ji, Hongbin/I-5625-2017","wong, kwok kin/0000-0001-6323-235X; ji, Hongbin/0000-0003-0891-6390; Ramsey, Matthew/0000-0003-2402-8502; Hayes, D.

In contrast, mammalian cells are thought to require the sequential activation of at least four different cyclin- dependent kinases, Cdk2, Cdk3, Cdk4 and Cdk6, to drive cells through interphase, as well as Cdk1 to proceed through mitosis(2). This model has been challenged by recent genetic evidence that mice survive in the absence of individual interphase Cdks(3-8). Moreover, most mouse cell types proliferate in the absence of two or even three interphase Cdks(8-10). Similar results have been obtained on ablation of some of the activating subunits of Cdks, such as the D- type and E- type cyclins(11-14). Here we show that mouse embryos lacking all interphase Cdks ( Cdk2, Cdk3, Cdk4 and Cdk6) undergo organogenesis and develop to midgestation. In these embryos, Cdk1 binds to all cyclins, resulting in the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein pRb and the expression of genes that are regulated by E2F transcription factors. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from these embryos proliferate in vitro, albeit with an extended cell cycle due to inefficient inactivation of Rb proteins. However, they become immortal on continuous passage. We also report that embryos fail to develop to the morula and blastocyst stages in the absence of Cdk1. These results indicate that Cdk1 is the only essential cell cycle Cdk. Moreover, they show that in the absence of interphase Cdks, Cdk1 can execute all the events that are required to drive cell division.","Ctr Nacl Invest Oncol CNIO, Mol Oncol Programme, E-28029 Madrid, Spain; Univ Bordeaux 2, EA2406, F-33076 Bordeaux, France; Western Gen Hosp, MRC, Human Genet Unit, Edinburgh EH4 2XU, Midlothian, Scotland","Barbacid, M (reprint author), Ctr Nacl Invest Oncol CNIO, Mol Oncol Programme, E-28029 Madrid, Spain.",mbarbacid@cnio.es,"Santamaria, David/D-3930-2011; Malumbres, Marcos/E-8834-2011; Caceres, Javier/D-5260-2013; Tardy, Claudine/G-2737-2017","Santamaria, David/0000-0002-4711-3569; Malumbres, Marcos/0000-0002-0829-6315; Caceres, Javier/0000-0001-8025-6169; ",Medical Research Council [MC_U127584479],,,24,396,405,6,39,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,16-Aug,2007,448,7155,,,,,811,U8,,10.1038/nature06046,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,200HJ,WOS:000248754200041,17700700.0,No,,,11/20/17,mariano,barbacid,male,1,310,MnhC3zUAAAAJ,57966

These RNAs activate signalling cascades that activate the genes that encode alpha- and beta- interferon ( IFN). Signalling occurs through the interaction of the RNAs with either of two pathogen recognition receptors, retinoic acid- inducible gene- I ( RIG- I, also known as DDX58) and melanoma differentiation associated gene- 5 ( MDA5, also known as IFIH1), which contain amino- terminal caspase activation and recruitment domains ( CARD) and carboxy- terminal DExD/ H Box RNA helicase motifs(2-5). RIG- I and MDA5 interact with another CARD protein, interferon-beta promotor stimulator protein- 1 ( IPS- 1, also known as MAVS, VISA and Cardif), in the mitochondrial membrane, which relays the signal through the transcription factors interferon regulatory factor 3 ( IRF- 3) and nuclear factor ( NF)- kappa B to the IFN-beta gene(6-10). Although the signalling pathway is well understood, the origin of the RNA molecules that initiate these processes is not. Here we show that activation of the antiviral endoribonuclease, RNase L(11), by 2',5'- linked oligoadenylate ( 2-5A)(12) produces small RNA cleavage products from self- RNA that initiate IFN production. Accordingly, mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking RNase L were resistant to the induction of IFN-beta expression in response to 2- 5A, dsRNA or viral infection. Single-stranded regions of RNA are cleaved 39 of UpUp and UpAp sequences by RNase L during viral infections, resulting in small, often duplex, RNAs(13,14). We show that small self- RNAs produced by the action of RNase L on cellular RNA induce IFN-beta expression and that the signalling involves RIG- I, MDA5 and IPS- 1. Mice lacking RNase L produce significantly less IFN-beta during viral infections than infected wild- type mice. Furthermore, activation of RNase L with 2- 5A in vivo induced the expression of IFN-beta in wild- type but not RNase L- deficient mice. Our results indicate that RNase L has an essential role in the innate antiviral immune response that relieves the requirement for direct sensing of non- self RNA.","Cleveland Clin, Dept Canc Biol, Lerner Res Inst, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA; Univ Washington, Sch Med, Dept Immunol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Silverman, RH (reprint author), Cleveland Clin, Dept Canc Biol, Lerner Res Inst, 9500 Euclid Ave, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA.",silverr@ccf.org,,"Gale, Michael/0000-0002-6332-7436","NCI NIH HHS [R01 CA044059, R01 CA044059-24]; NIAID NIH HHS [R15 AI089518, R15 AI089518-01]",,,30,325,344,1,33,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,16-Aug,2007,448,7155,,,,,816,U9,,10.1038/nature06042,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,200HJ,WOS:000248754200042,17653195.0,No,,,11/20/17,robert h.,silverman,na,na,na,na,na

BIR is thought to re- establish replication at stalled and broken replication forks and to act at eroding telomeres in cells that lack telomerase in pathways known as ' alternative lengthening of telomeres' ( reviewed in refs 2, 6). Here we show that, in haploid budding yeast, Rad51- dependent BIR induced by HO endonuclease requires the lagging strand DNA Pol alpha- primase complex as well as Pol delta to initiate new DNA synthesis. Pol epsilon is not required for the initial primer extension step of BIR but is required to complete 30 kb of new DNA synthesis. Initiation of BIR also requires the nonessential DNA Pol delta subunit Pol32 primarily through its interaction with another Pol delta subunit, Pol31. HO-induced gene conversion, in which both ends of a double- strand break engage in homologous recombination, does not require Pol32. Pol32 is also required for the recovery of both Rad51-dependent and Rad51- independent survivors in yeast strains lacking telomerase. These results strongly suggest that both types of telomere maintenance pathways occur by recombination-dependent DNA replication. Thus Pol32, dispensable for replication and for gene conversion, is uniquely required for BIR; this finding provides an opening into understanding how DNA replication re- start mechanisms operate in eukaryotes. We also note that Pol32 homologues have been identified both in fission yeast and in metazoans where telomerase- independent survivors with alternative telomere maintenance have also been identified(2,6,7).","Brandeis Univ, Rosenstiel Ctr, Waltham, MA 02454 USA","Haber, JE (reprint author), Brandeis Univ, Rosenstiel Ctr, MS029, Waltham, MA 02454 USA.",haber@brandeis.edu,,"Haber, James/0000-0002-1878-0610","NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM076020-01A1, R01 GM020056, R01 GM020056-32, R01 GM020056-33, R01 GM076020, R01 GM076020-02, R01 GM076020-03, T32 GM007122]",,,32,224,229,3,6,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,16-Aug,2007,448,7155,,,,,820,U10,,10.1038/nature06047,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,200HJ,WOS:000248754200043,17671506.0,No,,,11/20/17,james e.,haber,na,na,na,na,na

The pseudopeptide antibiotic andrimid is a nanomolar inhibitor of the bacterial acetyl- CoA carboxylase that catalyses the first committed step in prokaryotic fatty acid biosynthesis(1). Recently, the andrimid ( adm) biosynthetic gene cluster was isolated and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli(2). This establishes a heterologous biological host in which to rapidly probe features of andrimid formation and to use biosynthetic engineering to make unnatural variants of this important and promising new class of antibiotics. Bioinformatic analysis of the adm cluster revealed a dissociated biosynthetic assembly system lacking canonical amide synthases between the first three carrier protein domains. Here we report that AdmF, a transglutaminase ( TGase) homologue, catalyses the formation of the first amide bond, an N-acyl-beta-peptide link, in andrimid biosynthesis. Hence, AdmF is a newly discovered biosynthetic enzyme that acts as a stand- alone amide synthase between protein- bound, thiotemplated substrates in an antibiotic enzymatic assembly line. TGases ( enzyme class ( EC) 2.3.2.13) normally catalyse the cross- linking of ( poly) peptides by creating isopeptidic bonds between the gamma-carboxamide group of a glutamine side chain of one protein and various amine donors, including lysine side chains(3). To the best of our knowledge, the present study constitutes the first report of a TGase- like enzyme recruited for the assembly of an antibiotic. Moreover, genome mining using the AdmF sequence yielded additional TGases in unassigned natural product biosynthetic pathways. With many more microbial genomes being sequenced, such a strategy could potentially unearth biosynthetic pathways producing new classes of antibiotics.","Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem & Mol Pharmacol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Walsh, CT (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem & Mol Pharmacol, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",christopher_walsh@hms.harvard.edu,,,,,,19,39,40,0,18,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,16-Aug,2007,448,7155,,,,,824,U11,,10.1038/nature06068,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,200HJ,WOS:000248754200044,17653193.0,No,,,11/20/17,nathan a.,magarvey,na,na,na,na,na

There is considerable interest in developing new enzymes for the synthesis of chemicals and pharmaceuticals(1-3) and as tools for molecular biology. Methods have been developed for modifying and improving existing enzymes through screening, selection and directed evolution(4,5). However, the design and evolution of truly novel enzymes has relied on extensive knowledge of the mechanism of the reaction(6-10). Here we show that genuinely new enzymatic activities can be created de novo without the need for prior mechanistic information by selection from a naive protein library of very high diversity, with product formation as the sole selection criterion. We used messenger RNA display, in which proteins are covalently linked to their encoding mRNA(11), to select for functional proteins from an in vitro translated protein library of > 10(12) independent sequences without the constraints imposed by any in vivo step. This technique has been used to evolve new peptides and proteins that can bind a specific ligand(12-18), from both random- sequence libraries(12,14-16) and libraries based on a known protein fold(17,18). We now describe the isolation of novel RNA ligases from a library that is based on a zinc finger scaffold(18,19), followed by in vitro directed evolution to further optimize these enzymes. The resulting ligases exhibit multiple turnover with rate enhancements of more than two- million- fold.","Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Mol Biol, Simches Res Ctr 7215, Boston, MA 02114 USA; Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Howard Hughes Med Inst, CCIB, Simches Res Ctr 7215, Boston, MA 02114 USA","Szostak, JW (reprint author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Mol Biol, Simches Res Ctr 7215, 185 Cambridge St, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",szostak@molbio.mgh.harvard.edu,"Seelig, Burckhard/D-1042-2013","Seelig, Burckhard/0000-0001-8598-0586",Howard Hughes Medical Institute,,,37,120,125,0,57,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,16-Aug,2007,448,7155,,,,,828,U13,,10.1038/nature06032,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,200HJ,WOS:000248754200045,17700701.0,No,,,11/20/17,jack w.,szostak,na,na,na,na,na

Jasmonate treatment causes JAZ1 degradation and this degradation is dependent on activities of the SCFCOI1 ubiquitin ligase and the 26S proteasome. Furthermore, the jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile) conjugate, but not other jasmonate-derivatives such as jasmonate, 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid, or methyl-jasmonate, promotes physical interaction between COI1 and JAZ1 proteins in the absence of other plant proteins.

The identification more than a decade ago of COI1 as an F-box protein suggested the existence of a repressor of jasmonate responses that is targeted by the SCFCOI1 complex for proteasome degradation in response to jasmonate. Here we report the identification of JASMONATE-INSENSITIVE 3 (JAI3) and a family of related proteins named JAZ (jasmonate ZIM-domain), in Arabidopsis thaliana. Our results demonstrate that JAI3 and other JAZs are direct targets of the SCFCOI1 E3 ubiquitin ligase and jasmonate treatment induces their proteasome degradation. Moreover, JAI3 negatively regulates the key transcriptional activator of jasmonate responses, MYC2. The JAZ family therefore represents the molecular link between the two previously known steps in the jasmonate pathway. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of a regulatory feed-back loop involving MYC2 and JAZ proteins, which provides a mechanistic explanation for the pulsed response to jasmonate and the subsequent desensitization of the cell.","CSIC, Ctr Nacl Biotecnol, Dept Genet Mol Plantas, Madrid 28049, Spain; CSIC, Ctr Nacl Biotecnol, Unidad Genom, Madrid 28049, Spain; Univ Miguel Hernandez, Div Genet, Elche 03202, Spain; Univ Miguel Hernandez, Inst Bioingn, Elche 03202, Spain","Solano, R (reprint author), CSIC, Ctr Nacl Biotecnol, Dept Genet Mol Plantas, Campus Univ Autonoma, Madrid 28049, Spain.",rsolano@cnb.uam.es,"Micol, Jose Luis/B-4832-2010; Ponce, Maria Rosa/C-8203-2014; Lorenzo, Oscar/K-8170-2014; Solano, Roberto/O-5908-2017","Micol, Jose Luis/0000-0002-0396-1750; Ponce, Maria Rosa/0000-0003-0770-4230; Lorenzo, Oscar/0000-0001-9523-0789; Solano, Roberto/0000-0001-5459-2417; Chini, Andrea/0000-0001-5841-0254",,,,46,907,982,16,239,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,9-Aug,2007,448,7154,,,,,666,U4,,10.1038/nature06006,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,197ZY,WOS:000248598000038,17637675.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,r.,solano,na,na,na,na,na

For superfluid quantum gases, a variety of new physical phenomena arising from the symmetry-breaking interaction between electric or magnetic dipoles are expected(1). Novel quantum phases in optical lattices, such as chequerboard or supersolid phases, are predicted for dipolar bosons(2,3). Dipolar interactions can also enrich considerably the physics of quantum gases with internal degrees of freedom(4-6). Arrays of dipolar particles could be used for efficient quantum information processing(7). Here we report the realization of a chromium Bose-Einstein condensate with strong dipolar interactions. By using a Feshbach resonance, we reduce the usual isotropic contact interaction, such that the anisotropic magnetic dipole-dipole interaction between Cr-52 atoms becomes comparable in strength. This induces a change of the aspect ratio of the atom cloud; for strong dipolar interactions, the inversion of ellipticity during expansion (the usual 'smoking gun' evidence for a Bose-Einstein condensate) can be suppressed.

Ultrafast time-resolved methods usually require highly synchronized pulses to initiate a transition and then probe it after a precisely defined time delay. In the X-ray regime, these methods are challenging because they require complex optical systems and diagnostics. Here we propose and apply a simple holographic measurement scheme, inspired by Newton's 'dusty mirror' experiment(1), to monitor the X-ray-induced explosion of microscopic objects. The sample is placed near an X-ray mirror; after the pulse traverses the sample, triggering the reaction, it is reflected back onto the sample by the mirror to probe this reaction. The delay is encoded in the resulting diffraction pattern to an accuracy of one femtosecond, and the structural change is holographically recorded with high resolution. We apply the technique to monitor the dynamics of polystyrene spheres in intense free-electron-laser pulses, and observe an explosion occurring well after the initial pulse. Our results support the notion that X-ray flash imaging(2,3) can be used to achieve high resolution, beyond radiation damage limits for biological samples(4). With upcoming ultrafast X-ray sources we will be able to explore the three-dimensional dynamics of materials at the time-scale of atomic motion.","Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Livermore, CA 94550 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Biophoton Sci & Technol, Sacramento, CA 95817 USA; Stanford Univ, Stanford Linear Accelerator Ctr, Stanford Synchrotron Radiat Lab, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Uppsala Univ, Dept Cell & Mol Biol, Lab Mol Biophys, SE-75124 Uppsala, Sweden; Tech Univ Berlin, Inst Opt & Atomare Phys, D-10623 Berlin, Germany; DESY, D-22607 Hamburg, Germany","Chapman, HN (reprint author), Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, 7000 East Ave, Livermore, CA 94550 USA.",henry.chapman@llnl.gov,"; Marchesini, Stefano/A-6795-2009; Chapman, Henry/G-2153-2010; Bajt, Sasa/G-2228-2010; Bogan, Mike/I-6962-2012; Barty, Anton/K-5137-2014; Frank, Matthias/O-9055-2014; Treusch, Rolf/C-3935-2015","Treusch, Rolf/0000-0001-8479-8862; Seibert, Mark Marvin/0000-0003-0251-0744; Chapman, Henry/0000-0002-4655-1743; Bogan, Mike/0000-0001-9318-3333; Barty, Anton/0000-0003-4751-2727; ",,,,32,172,172,3,60,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,9-Aug,2007,448,7154,,,,,676,679,,10.1038/nature06049,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,197ZY,WOS:000248598000040,17687320.0,No,,,11/20/17,janos,hajdu,male,0.95,19,lhmRb1AAAAAJ,17120

This mixing is thought to result primarily from instability of the oceanic internal wave field(3), but internal waves tend to radiate energy away from the regions in which they are generated rather than dissipate it locally as turbulence(4) and the resulting distribution of turbulent mixing remains unknown. Another, more direct, mixing mechanism involves the generation of turbulence as strong flows pass through narrow passages in topography, but the amount of turbulence generated at such locations remains poorly quantified owing to a lack of direct measurements. Here we present observations from the crest of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in the subtropical North Atlantic Ocean that suggest that passages in rift valleys and ridge-flank canyons provide the most energetic sites for oceanic turbulence. Our measurements show that diffusivities as large as 0.03 m(2) s(-1) characterize the mixing downstream of a sill in a well-stratified boundary layer, with mixing levels remaining of the order of 10(-4) m(2) s(-1) at the base of the main thermocline. These mixing rates are significantly higher than the diffusivities of the order of 10(-5) m(2) s(-1) that characterize much of the global thermocline and the abyssal ocean(5). Our estimates suggest that overflows associated with narrow passages on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in the North Atlantic Ocean produce as much buoyancy flux as has previously been estimated for the entire Romanche fracture zone(6,7), a large strait in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge that connects the North and South Atlantic basins. This flux is equivalent to the interior mixing that occurs in the entire North Atlantic basin at the depth of the passages, suggesting that turbulence generated in narrow passages on mid-ocean ridges may be important for buoyancy flux at the global scale.","Florida State Univ, Dept Oceanog, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Div Ocean & Climate Phys, Palisades, NY 10964 USA","St Laurent, LC (reprint author), Florida State Univ, Dept Oceanog, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",stlaurent@ocean.fsu.edu,,,,,,28,32,32,0,23,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,9-Aug,2007,448,7154,,,,,680,683,,10.1038/nature06043,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,197ZY,WOS:000248598000041,17687321.0,No,,,11/20/17,andreas m.,thurnherr,na,na,na,na,na

Subducted sediment may be entrained in buoyantly upwelling plumes and returned to the Earth's surface at hotspots(2-5), but the proportion of recycled sediment in the mantle is small, and clear examples of recycled sediment in hotspot lavas are rare(6,7). Here we report remarkably enriched Sr-87/Sr-86 and Nd-143/Nd-144 isotope signatures in Samoan lavas from three dredge locations on the underwater flanks of Savai'i island, Western Samoa. The submarine Savai'i lavas represent the most extreme Sr-87/Sr-86 isotope compositions reported for ocean island basalts to date. The data are consistent with the presence of a recycled sediment component (with a composition similar to the upper continental crust) in the Samoan mantle. Trace-element data show affinities similar to those of the upper continental crust including exceptionally low Ce/Pb and Nb/U ratios(8)-that complement the enriched Sr-87/Sr-86 and Nd-143/Nd-144 isotope signatures. The geochemical evidence from these Samoan lavas significantly redefines the composition of the EM2 (enriched mantle 2; ref. 9) mantle endmember, and points to the presence of an ancient recycled upper continental crust component in the Samoan mantle plume.","MIT, Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Joint Program, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Oregon State Univ, Coll Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Jackson, MG (reprint author), MIT, Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Joint Program, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.",mjackson@whoi.edu,"Konter, Jasper/G-5206-2012; Wright, Dawn/A-4518-2011","Wright, Dawn/0000-0002-2997-7611; Kurz, Mark/0000-0003-1745-2356",,,,31,137,147,0,43,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,9-Aug,2007,448,7154,,,,,684,687,,10.1038/nature06048,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,197ZY,WOS:000248598000042,17687322.0,No,,,11/20/17,jamie a.,russell,na,na,na,na,na

The best known early hominin species, H. habilis and H. erectus, have often been interpreted as time-successive segments of a single anagenetic evolutionary lineage(3,7-10). The case for this was strengthened by the discovery of small early Pleistocene hominin crania from Dmanisi in Georgia that apparently provide evidence of morphological continuity between the two taxa(11,12). Here we describe two new cranial fossils from the Koobi Fora Formation, east of Lake Turkana in Kenya, that have bearing on the relationship between species of early Homo. A partial maxilla assigned to H. habilis reliably demonstrates that this species survived until later than previously recognized, making an anagenetic relationship with H. erectus unlikely. The discovery of a particularly small calvaria of H. erectus indicates that this taxon overlapped in size with H. habilis, and may have shown marked sexual dimorphism. The new fossils confirm the distinctiveness of H. habilis and H. erectus, independently of overall cranial size, and suggest that these two early taxa were living broadly sympatrically in the same lake basin for almost half a million years.","UCL, Dept Anat & Dev Biol, London WC1E 6BT, England; Koobi Fora Res Project, Nairobi 00502, Kenya; SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Anat Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Anthropol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; Univ Utah, Dept Geol & Geophys, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; NYU, Dept Anthropol, New York, NY 10003 USA; Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; Natl Museums Kenya, Div Palaeontol, Nairobi 00100, Kenya","Spoor, F (reprint author), UCL, Dept Anat & Dev Biol, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",f.spoor@ucl.ac.uk; meaveleakey@uuplus.com,"Spoor, Fred/C-1718-2008",,,,,28,166,173,3,62,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,9-Aug,2007,448,7154,,,,,688,691,,10.1038/nature05986,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,197ZY,WOS:000248598000043,17687323.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,l. n.,leakey,na,na,na,na,na

This impedes an understanding of global biodiversity patterns and explains why tropical insects are under-represented in conservation biology. Our study of approximately 500 species from three herbivorous guilds feeding on foliage (caterpillars, Lepidoptera), wood (ambrosia beetles, Coleoptera) and fruit (fruitflies, Diptera) found a low rate of change in species composition (beta diversity) across 75,000 square kilometres of contiguous lowland rainforest in Papua New Guinea, as most species were widely distributed. For caterpillars feeding on large plant genera, most species fed on multiple host species, so that even locally restricted plant species did not support endemic herbivores. Large plant genera represented a continuously distributed resource easily colonized by moths and butterflies over hundreds of kilometres. Low beta diversity was also documented in groups with differing host specificity (fruitflies and ambrosia beetles), suggesting that dispersal limitation does not have a substantial role in shaping the distribution of insect species in New Guinea lowland rainforests. Similar patterns of low beta diversity can be expected in other tropical lowland rainforests, as they are typically situated in the extensive low basins of major tropical rivers similar to the Sepik-Ramu region of New Guinea studied here.","Acad Sci Czech Republic, Ctr Biol, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic; Acad Sci Czech Republic, Sch Biol Sci, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic; Smithsonian Inst, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Washington, DC 20013 USA; Michigan State Univ, Dept Entomol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; Griffith Univ, Australian Sch Environm Studies, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia; Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Ancon, Panama; Univ Minnesota, Dept Entomol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; Univ Sussex, Sch Life Sci, Brighton BN1 9QG, E Sussex, England; New Guinea Binatang Res Ctr, Madang, Papua N Guinea; Univ Minnesota, Bell Museum Nat Hist, Biol Sci Ctr 250, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; Univ Minnesota, Dept Plant Biol, Biol Sci Ctr 250, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Novotny, V (reprint author), Acad Sci Czech Republic, Ctr Biol, Branisovska 31, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic.",novotny@entu.cas.cz,"Basset, Yves/B-6642-2014; Novotny, Vojtech/G-9434-2014; Janda, Milan/H-7216-2014","Basset, Yves/0000-0002-1942-5717; Novotny, Vojtech/0000-0001-7918-8023; Setliff, Gregory/0000-0002-1853-0232; Stewart, Alan/0000-0001-7878-8879; Miller, Scott/0000-0002-4138-1378",,,,54,145,153,1,99,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,9-Aug,2007,448,7154,,,,,692,U8,,10.1038/nature06021,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,197ZY,WOS:000248598000044,17687324.0,No,,,11/20/17,george d.,weiblen,na,na,na,na,na

A major challenge in community ecology and evolutionary biogeography is to reveal the mechanisms underlying these differences. For herbivorous insects, one such mechanism leading to an increased number of species in a given locale could be increased ecological specialization, resulting in a greater proportion of insect species occupying narrow niches within a community. We tested this hypothesis by comparing host specialization in larval Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) at eight different New World forest sites ranging in latitude from 15 degrees S to 55 degrees N. Here we show that larval diets of tropical Lepidoptera are more specialized than those of their temperate forest counterparts: tropical species on average feed on fewer plant species, genera and families than do temperate caterpillars. This result holds true whether calculated per lepidopteran family or for a caterpillar assemblage as a whole. As a result, there is greater turnover in caterpillar species composition (greater beta diversity) between tree species in tropical faunas than in temperate faunas. We suggest that greater specialization in tropical faunas is the result of differences in trophic interactions; for example, there are more distinct plant secondary chemical profiles from one tree species to the next in tropical forests than in temperate forests as well as more diverse and chronic pressures from natural enemy communities.","Tulane Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; Wesleyan Univ, Dept Biol, Middletown, CT 06459 USA; George Washington Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Washington, DC 20052 USA; Wright State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Dayton, OH 45435 USA; Univ Missouri, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63121 USA; Yanayacu Biol Stn, Quito, Ecuador; Ctr Creat Studies, Quito, Ecuador","Dyer, LA (reprint author), Tulane Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.",ldyer@tulane.edu,"Lill, John/A-7935-2009; Diniz, Ivone/J-1804-2012","Diniz, Ivone/0000-0002-4252-8810; Stireman, John/0000-0001-8792-3980",,,,35,236,246,7,166,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,9-Aug,2007,448,7154,,,,,696,U9,,10.1038/nature05884,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,197ZY,WOS:000248598000045,17687325.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,p. d.,coley,na,na,na,na,na

Chronic itch represents a significant clinical problem resulting from renal diseases and liver diseases, as well as several serious skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis(1-3). The identity of the itch-specific mediator in the central nervous system, however, remains elusive. Here we describe that the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) plays an important part in mediating itch sensation in the dorsal spinal cord. We found that gastrin-releasing peptide is specifically expressed in a small subset of peptidergic dorsal root ganglion neurons, whereas expression of its receptor GRPR is restricted to lamina I of the dorsal spinal cord. GRPR mutant mice showed comparable thermal, mechanical, inflammatory and neuropathic pain responses relative to wild-type mice. In contrast, induction of scratching behaviour was significantly reduced in GRPR mutant mice in response to pruritogenic stimuli, whereas normal responses were evoked by painful stimuli. Moreover, direct spinal cerebrospinal fluid injection of a GRPR antagonist significantly inhibited scratching behaviour in three independent itch models. These data demonstrate that GRPR is required for mediating the itch sensation rather than pain, at the spinal level. Our results thus indicate that GRPR may represent the first molecule that is dedicated to mediating the itch sensation in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, and thus may provide a central therapeutic target for antipruritic drug development.","Washington Univ, Sch Med, Pain Ctr, Dept Anesthesiol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; Washington Univ, Sch Med, Pain Ctr, Dept Mol Biol & Pharmacol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; Washington Univ, Sch Med, Pain Ctr, Dept Psychiat, St Louis, MO 63110 USA","Chen, ZF (reprint author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Pain Ctr, Dept Anesthesiol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.",chenz@wustl.edu,,,,,,30,329,335,8,53,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,9-Aug,2007,448,7154,,,,,700,U10,,10.1038/nature06029,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,197ZY,WOS:000248598000046,17653196.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,zhou-feng,chen,na,na,na,na,na

Abnormal enrichment of HD inclusion bodies with ubiquitin, a diagnostic characteristic of HD and many other neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases(3,4), has suggested that dysfunction in ubiquitin metabolism may contribute to the pathogenesis of these diseases(5,6). Because modification of proteins with polyubiquitin chains regulates many essential cellular processes including protein degradation, cell cycle, transcription, DNA repair and membrane trafficking(7), disrupted ubiquitin signalling is likely to have broad consequences for neuronal function and survival. Although ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation is impaired in cell-culture models of HD8-11 and of other neurodegenerative diseases(12,13), it has not been possible to evaluate the function of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in HD patients or in animal models of the disease, and a functional role for UPS impairment in neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis remains controversial(14-16). Here we exploit a mass-spectrometry-based method to quantify polyubiquitin chains(17) and demonstrate that the abundance of these chains is a faithful endogenous biomarker of UPS function. Lys 48-linked polyubiquitin chains accumulate early in pathogenesis in brains from the R6/2 transgenic mouse model of HD, from a knock-in model of HD and from human HD patients, establishing that UPS dysfunction is a consistent feature of HD pathology. Lys 63- and Lys 11-linked polyubiquitin chains, which are not typically associated with proteasomal targeting, also accumulate in the R6/2 mouse brain. Thus, HD is linked to global changes in the ubiquitin system to a much greater extent than previously recognized.","Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; PPD Biomarker Discovery Inc, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; Kings Coll London, Sch Med, Dept Med & Mol Genet, London SE1 9RT, England","Kopito, RR (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",kopito@stanford.edu,"Bates, Gillian/E-1146-2012","Bates, Gillian/0000-0002-4041-6305",Wellcome Trust,,,28,326,329,2,33,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,9-Aug,2007,448,7154,,,,,704,U11,,10.1038/nature06022,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,197ZY,WOS:000248598000047,17687326.0,No,,,11/20/17,ron r.,kopito,na,na,na,na,na

When placed in the context of odour-evoked Kenyon cell activity (a 20-Hz oscillatory population discharge), this form of STDP enhances the synchronization of the Kenyon cells' targets and thus helps preserve the propagation of the odour-specific codes through the olfactory system.","CALTECH, Div Biol, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Laurent, G (reprint author), CALTECH, Div Biol, 139-74, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",laurentg@caltech.edu,"Laurent, Gilles/A-4583-2012; Marion-Poll, Frederic/D-8882-2011","Marion-Poll, Frederic/0000-0001-6824-0180",,,,31,148,148,1,28,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,9-Aug,2007,448,7154,,,,,709,U12,,10.1038/nature05973,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,197ZY,WOS:000248598000048,17581587.0,No,,,11/20/17,gilles,laurent,male,1,225,sHJ-AioAAAAJ,54638

The establishment of patterns of DNA methylation during gametogenesis depends in part on DNMT3L, an enzymatically inactive regulatory factor that is related in sequence to the DNA methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B(1,2). The main proteins that interact in vivo with the product of an epitope-tagged allele of the endogenous Dnmt3L gene were identified by mass spectrometry as DNMT3A2, DNMT3B and the four core histones. Peptide interaction assays showed that DNMT3L specifically interacts with the extreme amino terminus of histone H3; this interaction was strongly inhibited by methylation at lysine 4 of histone H3 but was insensitive to modifications at other positions. Crystallographic studies of human DNMT3L showed that the protein has a carboxy-terminal methyltransferase-like domain and an N-terminal cysteine-rich domain. Cocrystallization of DNMT3L with the tail of histone H3 revealed that the tail bound to the cysteine-rich domain of DNMT3L, and substitution of key residues in the binding site eliminated the H3 tail-DNMT3L interaction. These data indicate that DNMT3L recognizes histone H3 tails that are unmethylated at lysine 4 and induces de novo DNA methylation by recruitment or activation of DNMT3A2.","Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Genet & Dev, New York, NY 10032 USA; Emory Univ, Dept Biochem, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; Rockefeller Univ, Lab Chromatin Biol, New York, NY 10021 USA; Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Program Mol Biol, New York, NY 10021 USA; Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Biotechnol, Taipei 106, Taiwan","Cheng, XD (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Genet & Dev, New York, NY 10032 USA.",XCheng@emory.edu; THB12@columbia.edu,,"Ooi, Steen/0000-0003-4198-9014; Tempst, Paul/0000-0002-6680-3987","NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM049245, R01 GM049245-14]",,,21,755,776,8,90,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,9-Aug,2007,448,7154,,,,,714,U13,,10.1038/nature05987,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,197ZY,WOS:000248598000049,17687327.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,timothy h.,bestor,na,na,na,na,na

LSD1 is a lysine-specific histone demethylase that represses transcription by demethylating histone H3 on lysine 4 (ref. 1). The LSD1 complex contains a number of proteins, all of which have been assigned roles in events upstream of LSD1-mediated demethylation(2-4) apart from BHC80 (also known as PHF21A), a plant homeodomain (PHD) finger-containing protein. Here we report that, in contrast to the PHD fingers of the bromodomain PHD finger transcription factor (BPTF) and inhibitor of growth family 2 (ING2), which bind methylated H3K4 (H3K4me3)(5,6), the PHD finger of BHC80 binds unmethylated H3K4 (H3K4me0), and this interaction is specifically abrogated by methylation of H3K4. The crystal structure of the PHD finger of BHC80 bound to an unmodified H3 peptide has revealed the structural basis of the recognition of H3K4me0. Knockdown of BHC80 by RNA inhibition results in the de-repression of LSD1 target genes, and this repression is restored by the reintroduction of wild-type BHC80 but not by a PHD-finger mutant that cannot bind H3. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that BHC80 and LSD1 depend reciprocally on one another to associate with chromatin. These findings couple the function of BHC80 to that of LSD1, and indicate that unmodified H3K4 is part of the 'histone code'(7). They further raise the possibility that the generation and recognition of the unmodified state on histone tails in general might be just as crucial as post-translational modifications of histone for chromatin and transcriptional regulation.","Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Univ Naples Federico 2, Dipartimento Biochim & Biotecnol Med, I-80131 Naples, Italy","Cheng, XD (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, 77 Ave Louis Pasteur, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",xcheng@emory.edu; yshi@hms.harvard.edu,"Horton, John/F-2375-2010","Shi, Xiaobing/0000-0001-5242-8189; De Cegli, Rossella/0000-0002-8526-8692","NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM068680, R01 GM068680-02]",,,34,244,253,4,42,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,9-Aug,2007,448,7154,,,,,718,U14,,10.1038/nature06034,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,197ZY,WOS:000248598000050,17687328.0,No,,,11/20/17,yang,shi,male,0.65,93,na,na

One particularly simple system is a ferromagnet approaching its Curie temperature, T(C), where all of the spins associated with partially filled atomic shells acquire parallel orientation. With the addition of disorder by way of chemical substitution, the Curie point is suppressed, but no qualitatively new phenomena appear in bulk measurements as long as the disorder is truly random on the atomic scale and not so large as to eliminate ferromagnetism entirely(1). Here we report the discovery that a simply measured magnetic response is singular above the Curie temperature of a model, disordered magnet, and that the associated singularity grows to an anomalous divergence at T(C). The origin of the singular response is the random internal field induced by an external magnetic field transverse to the favoured direction for magnetization(2-4). The fact that ferromagnets can be studied easily and with high precision using bulk susceptibility and a large variety of imaging tools will not only advance fundamental studies of the random field problem, but also suggests a mechanism for tuning the strength of domain wall pinning, the key to applications.","Univ Chicago, James Franck Inst, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; Univ Chicago, Dept Phys, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; MPI Res Inc, East Brunswick, NJ 08816 USA; MIT, Lincoln Lab, Lexington, MA 02420 USA; Univ Calif Merced, Sch Nat Sci, Merced, CA 95344 USA; UCL, London Ctr Nanotechnol, London WC1E 6BT, England; UCL, Dept Phys & Astron, London WC1E 6BT, England","Rosenbaum, TF (reprint author), Univ Chicago, James Franck Inst, 5640 S Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",tfr@uchicago.edu,,,,,,27,43,43,1,19,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Aug,2007,448,7153,,,,,567,570,,10.1038/nature06050,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,195XV,WOS:000248446700037,17671498.0,No,,,11/20/17,t. f.,rosenbaum,na,na,na,na,na

The specific band structure of graphene, with its unique valley structure and Dirac neutrality point separating hole states from electron states, has led to the observation of new electronic transport phenomena such as anomalously quantized Hall effects, absence of weak localization and the existence of a minimum conductivity(1). In addition to dissipative transport, supercurrent transport has also been observed(2). Graphene might also be a promising material for spintronics and related applications, such as the realization of spin qubits, owing to the low intrinsic spin orbit interaction, as well as the low hyperfine interaction of the electron spins with the carbon nuclei(3,4). Here we report the observation of spin transport, as well as Larmor spin precession, over micrometre-scale distances in single graphene layers. The 'non-local' spin valve geometry was used in these experiments, employing four-terminal contact geometries with ferromagnetic cobalt electrodes making contact with the graphene sheet through a thin oxide layer. We observe clear bipolar (changing from positive to negative sign) spin signals that reflect the magnetization direction of all four electrodes, indicating that spin coherence extends underneath all of the contacts. No significant changes in the spin signals occur between 4.2 K, 77K and room temperature. We extract a spin relaxation length between 1.5 and 2 mm at room temperature, only weakly dependent on charge density. The spin polarization of the ferromagnetic contacts is calculated from the measurements to be around ten per cent.","Univ Groningen, Zernike Inst Adv Mat, NL-9747 AG Groningen, Netherlands","Tombros, N (reprint author), Univ Groningen, Zernike Inst Adv Mat, Nijenborgh 4, NL-9747 AG Groningen, Netherlands.",n.tombros@rug.nl,,,,,,17,1439,1446,45,651,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,2-Aug,2007,448,7153,,,,,571,U4,,10.1038/nature06037,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,195XV,WOS:000248446700038,17632544.0,No,Y,N,11/20/17,bart j.,van wees,na,na,na,na,na

They consist of a mixture of light-absorbing and light-scattering aerosols(1) and therefore contribute to atmospheric solar heating and surface cooling. The sum of the two climate forcing terms-the net aerosol forcing effect is thought to be negative and may have masked as much as half of the global warming attributed to the recent rapid rise in greenhouse gases(2). There is, however, at least a fourfold uncertainty(2) in the aerosol forcing effect. Atmospheric solar heating is a significant source of the uncertainty, because current estimates are largely derived from model studies. Here we use three lightweight unmanned aerial vehicles that were vertically stacked between 0.5 and 3 km over the polluted Indian Ocean. These unmanned aerial vehicles deployed miniaturized instruments measuring aerosol concentrations, soot amount and solar fluxes. During 18 flight missions the three unmanned aerial vehicles were flown with a horizontal separation of tens of metres or less and a temporal separation of less than ten seconds, which made it possible to measure the atmospheric solar heating rates directly. We found that atmospheric brown clouds enhanced lower atmospheric solar heating by about 50 per cent. Our general circulation model simulations, which take into account the recently observed widespread occurrence of vertically extended atmospheric brown clouds over the Indian Ocean and Asia(3), suggest that atmospheric brown clouds contribute as much as the recent increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gases to regional lower atmospheric warming trends.

Although the number of observations of non-volcanic tremor is steadily increasing, the causative mechanism remains unclear. Some have attributed non-volcanic tremor to the movement of fluids(2-6), while its coincidence with geodetically observed slow-slip events at regular intervals(7,8) has led others to consider slip on the plate interface as its cause(7-14). Low-frequency earthquakes in Japan, which are believed to make up at least part of non-volcanic tremor(9), have focal mechanisms(10) and locations(11) that are consistent with tremor being generated by shear slip on the subduction interface. In Cascadia, however, tremor locations appear to be more distributed in depth than in Japan(3,4), making them harder to reconcile with a plate interface shear-slip model. Here we identify bursts of tremor that radiated from the Cascadia subduction zone near Vancouver Island, Canada, during the strongest shaking from the moment magnitude M-w=7.8, 2002 Denali, Alaska, earthquake. Tremor occurs when the Love wave displacements are to the southwest (the direction of plate convergence of the overriding plate), implying that the Love waves trigger the tremor. We show that these displacements correspond to shear stresses of approximately 40 kPa on the plate interface, which suggests that the effective stress on the plate interface is very low. These observations indicate that tremor and possibly slow slip can be instantaneously induced by shear stress increases on the subduction interface-effectively a frictional failure response to the driving stress.","Univ Washington, Dept Earth & Space Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, US Geol Survey, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Rubinstein, JL (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Earth & Space Sci, Box 351310, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",justin@ess.washington.edu,"Vidale, John/H-4965-2011","Vidale, John/0000-0002-3658-818X; Rubinstein, Justin/0000-0003-1274-6785",,,,26,130,131,0,10,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,2-Aug,2007,448,7153,,,,,579,582,,10.1038/nature06017,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,195XV,WOS:000248446700040,17671500.0,No,,,11/20/17,stephen d.,malone,na,na,na,na,na

The classic neo-darwinian view postulates that species differences result from the accumulation of small-effect changes at multiple loci. However, many examples support the possible role of larger abrupt changes in the expression of developmental genes in morphological evolution(1-3). Although this evidence might be considered a challenge to a neo-darwinian micromutationist view of evolution, there are currently few examples of the actual genes causing morphological differences between species(4-10). Here we examine the genetic basis of a trichome pattern difference between Drosophila species, previously shown to result from the evolution of a single gene, shavenbaby (svb), probably through cis-regulatory changes(6). We first identified three distinct svb enhancers from D. melanogaster driving reporter gene expression in partly overlapping patterns that together recapitulate endogenous svb expression. All three homologous enhancers from D. sechellia drive expression in modified patterns, in a direction consistent with the evolved svb expression pattern. To test the influence of these enhancers on the actual phenotypic difference, we conducted interspecific genetic mapping at a resolution sufficient to recover multiple intragenic recombinants. This functional analysis revealed that independent genetic regions upstream of svb that overlap the three identified enhancers are collectively required to generate the D. sechellia trichome pattern. Our results demonstrate that the accumulation of multiple small-effect changes at a single locus underlies the evolution of a morphological difference between species. These data support the view that alleles of large effect that distinguish species may sometimes reflect the accumulation of multiple mutations of small effect at select genes.","Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; Ctr Dev Biol, F-31062 Toulouse 4, France","Stern, DL (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",dstern@princeton.edu,"Phelps, Steve/H-2263-2011","McGregor, Alistair/0000-0002-2908-2420; PAYRE, Francois/0000-0002-8144-6711; Stern, David/0000-0002-1847-6483","NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM063622, R01 GM063622-01]",,,37,182,185,2,30,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Aug,2007,448,7153,,,,,587,U6,,10.1038/nature05988,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,195XV,WOS:000248446700042,17632547.0,No,,,11/20/17,david l.,stern,na,na,na,na,na

A number of genetic determinants of T1D have already been established through candidate gene studies, primarily within the major histocompatibility complex(2-4) but also within other loci(5-12). To identify new genetic factors that increase the risk of T1D, we performed a genome-wide association study in a large paediatric cohort of European descent. In addition to confirming previously identified loci(2-9), we found that T1D was significantly associated with variation within a 233-kb linkage disequilibrium block on chromosome 16p13. This region contains KIAA0350, the gene product of which is predicted to be a sugar-binding, C-type lectin. Three common non-coding variants of the gene (rs2903692, rs725613 and rs17673553) in strong linkage disequilibrium reached genome-wide significance for association with T1D. A subsequent transmission disequilibrium test replication study in an independent cohort confirmed the association. These results indicate that KIAA0350 might be involved in the pathogenesis of T1D and demonstrate the utility of the genome-wide association approach in the identification of previously unsuspected genetic determinants of complex traits.","Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Ctr Appl Genom, Abramson Res Ctr, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Abramson Res Ctr, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Dept Pediat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Div Human Genet, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Div Endocrinol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; McGill Univ, Dept Pediat, Montreal, PQ H3H 1P3, Canada; McGill Univ, Dept Human Genet, Montreal, PQ H3H 1P3, Canada; Univ Manitoba, Dept Pediat & Child Hlth, Winnipeg, MB R3E 0Z2, Canada; Univ Ottawa, Div Endocrinol, Childrens Hosp Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, ON K1H 8L1, Canada; Markham Stouffville Hosp, Markham, ON L3P 7P3, Canada; Childrens Hosp Philadelphia Nucleic Acid & Prot C, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; Univ Penn, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; Univ Penn, Ctr Clin Epidemiol & Biostat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Hakonarson, H (reprint author), Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Ctr Appl Genom, Abramson Res Ctr, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",hakonarson@chop.edu; constantin.polychronakos@mcgill.ca,"Polychronakos, Constantin/B-8151-2008; Qu, Hui-Qi/B-4719-2009; Orange, Jordan/D-5239-2009","Qu, Hui-Qi/0000-0001-9317-4488; Polychronakos, Constantin/0000-0002-7624-6635; STANLEY, CHARLES/0000-0003-4881-9392; Lawson, Margaret/0000-0002-2370-9552; orange, jordan/0000-0001-7117-7725",,,,35,340,355,0,16,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,2-Aug,2007,448,7153,,,,,591,U7,,10.1038/nature06010,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,195XV,WOS:000248446700043,17632545.0,No,,,11/20/17,constantin,polychronakos,male,0.83,18,na,na
